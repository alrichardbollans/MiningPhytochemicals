Literature data showed that T. polium has toxic effect on kidney tissue. Moreover, in some of the studies on the liver and in all clinical reports, T. polium has also been proven to have toxic effect on the liver. The components responsible for toxicity are thought to be neo-clerodane diterpenoids. However, it has been reported that flavonoids and some polyphenols in the plant also show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It has been concluded that more attention should be paid to the use of this plant. More clinical studies are needed to better understand the effects of T. polium on the liver. The effects of the plant on blood serum parameters and histological changes on the liver tissue should be documented in more detail. It was also concluded that that regular consumption of T. polium should be avoided for long periods of time. Edited by: B.

Introduction Many sources suggest that the use of plants as medicines is as old as the written history of humanity. However, the use of plants for the treatment of various diseases probably dates back to written history (Gunes et al., 2017). The history of many active medicines today goes back to the Hellenic civilization. In Egyptian Ebers Papyrus, which is thought to date back to 1500 BC, it is known that many medicinal plants are classified according to their therapeutic properties. On the other hand, it is claimed that the Balinese and Assyrians mentioned many herbal remedies such as licorice, cinnamon and coriander. It is also known that in a work written by Chinese doctor Chou Kung in 1100 BC, the use of certain herbal medicines are described. Additionally, Sustruta, published in the ea- rly period of Christianity, contains information about 700 herbal medicines. Galen's contribution to herbal medicine is also very valuable. The herbal extract preparation methods developed by Galen are still practiced today with the term \u2018Galenic' (Al-Asmari et al., 2014). Traditional medicine is a system of therapeutic methods established by local people within their own belief, socio-cultural values and varies greatly from country to country, even from region to region (Alachkar et al., 2011). Information on herbal products used for medicinal purposes has been transmitted from generation to generation for centuries and highly reliable application systems have been created with increasing experience and constantly changing information in each generation (Hayta et al., 2014). It can be argued that what percentage of the world's population actually uses local and traditional medicines. However, research on the determination of this ratio shows that a significant number of people have great interest in herbal treatment methods. Studies conducted in Australia and the United States show that 34-48.5% of the Please cite this article as: Sihoglu Tepe, A., Ozaslan, M., Kilic, I.H.., Bayil Oguzkan, A., 2021. Traditional uses, phytochemistry, and toxic potential of Teucrium polium L.: A comprehensive review. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41. A. Sihoglu Tepe et al. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 2 participants benefit from traditional treatment methods at least once in their lifetime (Hasani-Ranjbar et al., 2008). The WHO is working hard to integrate traditional medical methods into official health systems (Alachkar et al., 2011). According to the data published by WHO, approximately 70-80% of the population living in developing countries meets their treatment needs primarily by using medicinal plants (Milosevic-Djordjevic et al., 2018). The main reason for this is thought to be the economic difficulties people face. Because, in developing countries, people who have difficulty in meeting the high pharmaceutical costs are turning to herbal alternatives for health needs (Khader et al., 2010). It is estimated that approximately 50.000-70.000 plant species are used for this purpose in all over the world. Today, the international herbal product market with an annual trade volume of 62 billion dollars is estimated to reach 5 trillion dollars by 2050 (Hayta et al., 2014). Teucrium (Lamiaceae) is a perennial, polymorphic and cosmopolitan genus, wildly distributed in temperate regions of Europe, especially the Mediterranean, and North Africa (Milosevic-Djordjevic et al., 2018). There are reports that Teucrium species are also distributed in Asia, America and Australia (Khaled-Khodja et al., 2014). According to some sources, this genus contains 300 plant species (El Atki et al., 2019b; Khani and Heydarian, 2014; Sadeghi et al., 2014a), while other sources state that there are 340 or more species (Boghrati et al., 2016; De Martino et al., 2010; Sabzeghabaie and Asgarpanah, 2016). Teucrium species have evolved considerably in both growth characteristics and aromas through natural hybridization and selection mechanisms (Asgharipour and Shabankare, 2017). They usually grow in dry and stony areas (Khani and Heydarian, 2014). Teucrium species have been used as medicinal plants for more than 2000 years because of their therapeutic properties (Hachicha et al., 2009; Hasani-Ranjbar et al., 2010). According to ethnopharmacological records, members of this genus have long been used in the treatment of gastrointestinal problems, absorption disorders, cough, asthma, cognitive disorders, colds, pulmonary diseases, fungal infections and parasitic diseases (Boghrati et al., 2016; Elmasri et al., 2014; Khaled-Khodja et al., 2014; Kovacevic et al., 2001; Menichini et al., 2009; Sabzeghabaie and Asgarpanah, 2016; Sadeghi et al., 2014a; Sayyad and Farahmandfar, 2017). Teucrium species are also known as stimulant, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, analgesic, carminative, diuretic, perspiring, amoebicidal, antispasmodic, anti-rheumatic, antiseptic, antihelminic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anti-feedant, anticonvulsant and flavouring agents as well as their use as tonics (De Martino et al., 2010; Elmasri et al., 2014; Grubesic et al., 2012; Hachicha et al., 2009; Hasani-Ranjbar et al., 2010; Khaled-Khodja et al., 2014; Kovacevic et al., 2001; Menichini et al., 2009; Sabzeghabaie and Asgarpanah, 2016; Sadeghi et al., 2014a; Stefkov et al., 2011). These species are also preferred in the preparation of flavored wines, herbal teas and liqueurs (Menichini et al., 2009). T. polium is a plant species belonging to Ajugoideae subfamily of Lamiaceae family. The name of this plant is known to originate from the union of the Greek terms \u201cte\u00facrion\u201d, in honor of an ancient Trojan king. According to Pliny, the Roman historian and writer, the Trojan king was the first to use this plant for medical purposes. Polium, the species name of the plant, comes from the old Greek word \"poli\u00f2n\". This word is used to indicate that the flower colour of the plant is whitish grey (Venditti et al., 2017). It is known that T. polium has some subspecies or varieties such as aurasiacum, pilosum, aragonense, capitatum, gnaphalodes, cylindricum, vincentinum, expansum, polium, yalentinum (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2012). T. polium is a perennial and aromatic herbaceous plant, of which base has a woody structure (Abadian et al., 2016; Venditti et al., 2017). The plant has round and pubescent stalks. The stem of the plant is erected and can extend up to 10-35 cm (Amraei et al., 2018a; Venditti et al., 2017). The plant can grow up to 30-50 cm (Abadian et al., 2016). The upper parts of the body have a fully branched anatomical appearance. The leaves of the plant are 2 cm long and 4 mm wide (Venditti et al., 2017). Some sources indicate that the leaves may be 1-3 cm long (Afifi et al., 2005; Al-Qudah et al., 2011; Asgharipour and Shabankare, 2017). The lower parts have intact and folded margins; on the contrary, the margins in the upper parts are crenate and outstretched. It blooms in different colours ranging from pink to yellow between April and August (Venditti et al., 2017). Some sources indicate that the colour of the flower may be of varying tones of white or pale cream (Abadian et al., 2016; Alizadeh et al., 2011; Asgharipour and Shabankare, 2017). It is known that bruised foliage releases a pleasant aromatic odour (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2012; Mahmoudabady et al., 2018; Menichini et al., 2009). The flowering branches and leaves of the plant are known to contain essential oil (Ravan et al., 2019). The fruits are light brown to dark brown nutlets with a latticed surface (Sabzeghabaie and Asgarpanah, 2016). T. polium is known to spread in almost all Mediterranean countries from Southeast Asia to Europe (Venditti et al., 2017). Plant shows more intensive distribution in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Turkey (Aburjai et al., 2006; Afifi et al., 2005). The plant has also been reported to distribute overseas, such as Australia and America (Chioibas et al., 2019). Dry and stony hills, calcareous soils and deserts up to 3000 m are typical habitats of the plant (Sayyad and Farahmandfar, 2017; Venditti et al., 2017). Some researchers report that the plant grows also on gravel and sandy beaches (Amraei et al., 2018a). The plant has seasonal metamorphosis to adapt to the stressful climatic conditions seen in winter and summer seasons (Lianopoulou et al., 2014). In this review, all published studies on the ethnopharmacological properties, phytochemistry and toxic potentials of T. polium from 1981 to November 2019 were screened. It is known that T. polium is frequently used by local people in the treatment of various diseases. The aim of this study was to gather information about the traditional use and phytochemistry of T. polium, to discuss contradictory views about chemotaxonomy and its toxic effect on liver and kidneys, and to make suggestions about controversial areas and gaps in the literature. Although T. polium is one of the most important plants used by local people, scientific data show that this plant can cause serious toxicity to organs such as liver and kidney. Not only people, but also scientists have opposing views on the reliability of the use of the plant. Some scientific studies have reported that the plant has a hepatoprotective effect, while some others (especially some case reports) suggest that the plant has toxic effects due to the various phytochemical ingredients. This leads to speculative situations regarding the use of the plant. Here, the information put forward by different social groups (both local people and the scientific community) is given and an assessment of the therapeutic potential of the plant is made considering the balance of profit and loss. In addition, the gaps in this field were discussed and some suggestions were made regarding the actions to be taken to eliminate these gaps. 2. Methodology In order to get literature data on the ethnopharmacological properties, phytochemistry and toxic potential of T. polium, a search was performed using the keyword \u2018Teucrium polium\u2019 in Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases. As a result of the A. Sihoglu Tepe et al. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 3 screening, an EndNote library consisting of 379 studies containing the aforementioned keyword was created from 1981 to November 2019. Two authors screened these studies in detail at the text level and as a result of this first stage the number of records has been reduced to 276 by eliminating some of them, which does not contain T. polium actually as the keyword. The remaining records were then grouped according to the characteristics of Teucrium genus, geographic distribution, botanical properties and historical background of T. polium, ethnopharmacological uses, phytochemical composition and toxicity on kidney and liver. In addition, one of the authors identified the local names of the plant in different languages and converted them into a table (Table 1). Data obtained from ethnopharmacological studies, phytochemistry and toxicity findings were given in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. As a result of the ethnopharmacological research, controversial data regarding toxic and/or protective properties of this plant, especially on the liver, were obtained. Therefore, ethnopharmacological data and the results of scientific studies were compared and a consistent and holistic judgment was tried to be reached. Finally, the gaps created by the conflicting data about T. polium were pointed out, and opinions were given about what needs to be done to eliminate these gaps. Table 1.

Traditional and medicinal use T. polium is known by different local names in different languages and cultures. Table 1 shows the local names of T. polium in different geographical regions of the world. Since the plant has a Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin, it is seen that the native languages of these countries play an important role in determining the local names and the different names used in the same country are similar to each other phonetically. T. polium is known in Turkish, Arabic and Persian with a large number of local names that are thought to have differentiated over time from the same source. While the names \u2018Calpoureh\u2019 or \u2018Kalpoureh\u2019 are common in Persian, \u2018Ja\u2019adeh\u2019 and its derivatives are used frequently in Arabic. In Tunisia, whose official language is Arabic, T. polium is called as \u2018Al-Ja\u2019adeh\u2019, \u2018Khayata\u2019 or \u2018Gattaba\u2019. It is stated that these terms mean \u2018cicatrisant\u2019 in Arabic (Ben Othman et al., 2017). In some countries, the local names of the plant may also vary regionally. For example, in the eastern regions of Algeria, T. polium is called as \u2018Kayatta\u2019, while in the western regions it is known as \u2018Jaadah\u2019 (Bendif et al., 2018). Because of its pharmacological and/or toxic effects on certain tissues and organs, T. polium attracted the attention of scientists from Western countries as well as researchers from Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Therefore, in Western languages, T. A. Sihoglu Tepe et al. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 4 polium is commonly known as \u2018Germander\u2019, \u2018Golden Germander\u2019 and \u2018Felty Germander\u2019. T. polium is one of the most popular herbal remedies in the world and has been used by local people for the treatment of various ailments for over 2000 years (Hasanein and Shahidi, 2012). Its use as a medicinal herb dates back to Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Palin and Galen (Ghasemi et al., 2019a). This plant has been used medicinally since ancient Greek times (Menichini et al., 2009; Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018) and medical of reputation of this plant was also noticed in traditional medicine by Socrates and Jalinous (Mahmoudi et al., 2015; Seyyednejad and Motamedi, 2010). Table 2 gives information about the diseases which T. polium is used for treatment among the local people. The table also specifies which parts of the plant are used, how they are prepared and how they are used. Based on the data in the table, it is possible to make a judgment about the usage habits and frequency of use of this plant. As it is known, ethnopharmacological knowledge is transferred from past to present through generations and enriched with increasing experience in each generation. In the table, information on the use of the plant in the treatment of certain diseases is expressed by many authors, while the number of authors who comment on the use of the plant in the treatment of some other diseases is less. This shows that the effectiveness of T. polium in the treatment of some diseases has been verified through generations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reliability of the information will increase as the accumulation of knowledge confirming each other about the therapeutic properties of the plant on any disease increases.

Among these studies, those who stated that the plant has anti-diabetic and/or insulinotropic effect are in the first place (79 reports, 65.8% of the total). This is followed by the plant's anti-nociceptive effect (71 reports, 59.2% of the total), therapeutic potential on gastrointestinal diseases (59 reports, 49.2% of the total), and anti-inflammatory activity (50 reports, 41.7% of the total). The plant is also often used for its anti-pyretic, anti-hypertensive, diuretic, antimicrobial (i.e. anti-bacterial and anti-fungal) activities and its effectiveness on upper respiratory tract infections (chronic bronchitis, asthma, cough, expectorant, common cold, and flu). There is a detailed discussion of the toxic effects of the plant under the heading \u2018Toxicity on kidney and liver'. However, it is worth mentioning that the plant has some therapeutic properties on liver and kidney disorders. Although there is some scientific evidence that the plant has toxic effects on the liver and kidney, it is known that the plant is frequently used by the local people in the treatment of liver diseases, hepatitis, kidney stones, kidney pain and other kidney diseases. Therefore, a profit-loss balance regarding the use of the plant should be considered. It is believed that both health authorities and scientists should provide a satisfactory explanation of the therapeutic properties of the plant without ignoring toxic effects. As can be seen from Table 1, there are very few reports on the therapeutic properties of the plant on certain diseases. For example, one or two reports claims that T. polium is effective in the treatment of amenorrhea, obesity, emesis, neurotonic disorders, skin erythema and snake/scorpion bite or can be used as anti-cancer, antiseptic, astringent, flavouring, anti-mutagenic, insect repellent, anti-feedant, sedative and body weight loss agent agents. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of the plant on these disorders should be considered with suspicion. It would be a more realistic approach to have doubts before obtaining satisfactory information about the therapeutic potential of the plant on these ailments. It was previously stated that the plant is a species of Eastern and Central Mediterranean origin. Therefore, this plant is mostly used by people living in the Middle East for therapeutic purposes. It is seen that especially the Iranians frequently use this plant in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Alamdar et al., 2007; Amini et al., 2009; Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2011, 2012; Esmaeili and Yazdanparast, 2004; Farahmandfar et al., 2019; Ghasemi et al., 2019a; Khodadadi et al., 2018; Movahedi et al., 2014), gastrointestinal disorders (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2011, 2012; Boghrati et al., 2016; Farahmandfar et al., 2019; Khodadadi et al., 2018; Raei et al., 2014), inflammation (Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007; Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2011; Forouzandeh et al., 2013; Ghasemi et al., 2019a; Movahedi et al., 2014), abdominal colic, pain and tension (Alamdar et al., 2007; Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2012; Farahmandfar et al., 2019; Ghasemi et al., 2019a; Raei et al., 2014), common cold, grippe (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2012; Boghrati et al., 2016; Farahmandfar et al., 2019; Raei et al., 2014), bacterial infections (Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007; Forouzandeh et al., 2013; Ghasemi et al., 2019a; Movahedi et al., 2014), hypertension (Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007; Forouzandeh et al., 2013; Movahedi et al., 2014), urogenital diseases (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2012; Raei et al., 2014), rheumatism (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2011; Farahmandfar et al., 2019), hyperlipidaemia (Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007; Forouzandeh et al., 2013), heart failure (Khodadadi et al., 2018; Niazmand et al., 2017), headache (Abadian et al., 2016; Alamdar et al., 2007), convulsion (Abadian et al., 2016; Ghasemi et al., 2019a), kidney stones (Alamdar et al., 2007), dysmenorrhea (Abadian et al., 2016), diarrhoea (Ghasemi et al., 2019a), dementia (Ghasemi et al., 2019a) and as anti-spasmodic (Alamdar et al., 2007; Forouzandeh et al., 2013; Movahedi et al., 2014), anti-pyretic (Forouzandeh et al., 2013; Movahedi et al., 2014), anti-nociceptive (Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007; Movahedi et al., 2014), visceral pain killer (Zendehdel et al., 2011), vermifuge (Alamdar et al., 2007), diuretic (Movahedi et al., 2014), diaphoretic (Movahedi et al., 2014) and depurative agents (Alamdar et al., 2007). It is also known that this plant is one of the first remedies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially in the southern parts of Iran (Bahramikia and Yazdanparast, 2011, 2012). As a result of ethnopharmacological researches, it was understood that T. polium is not only used for the treatment of various diseases, but is also consumed for certain purposes in kitchens. The plant is especially valuable in the Middle Eastern cuisine as appetizer, condiment and spice, flavouring agent, tonic and tea. Especially in Iran, it is widely used as appetizer and spice (Sharififar et al., 2009). Although the issue of safety is one of the most debated issues, it is reported that the plant does not have any critical side effects although it is consumed so often in the Middle East (Derakhshan et al., 2011). The plant is also used as a refreshing beverage in personal care (Goulas et al., 2012; Krishnaiah et al., 2011; Movahedi et al., 2014; Sharififar et al., 2009; Tepe et al., 2011; Tepe et al., 2012). In addition to the purposes for which the plant is used, it is necessary to mention which parts are consumed and in what way. Almost all of the sources evaluated indicate that the aerial parts of the plant are used. While some studies do not specify the form of preparation, the majority of the studies state that an infusion or a decoction is prepared from the plant. It is seen that the aerial parts of the plant or the powder obtained from these parts are often consumed as tea or raw material. Sometimes the aerial parts of the plant are consumed by cooking. There are also cases where the aerial parts of the plant are chewed in the mouth or mixed with honey to relieve stomach ailments. When the usage behaviour of the local people is evaluated, it is seen that there is no standardized use of the plant. There are those who use one tea cup tea or infusion on an empty stomach in the morning, after each meal, one or two times a day before meals until recovery and three times a week, as well as those who consume the same amount of tea or infusion twice a day for 1-2 weeks. It has been reported that the plant can be administered topically for snake/scorpion bites or as insect repellent/anti-feedant agent as well as the above-mentioned oral uses. A. Sihoglu Tepe et al.

The components are listed in alphabetical order. 2 ssp : subspecies, 3 var: variety, 4 TCM: Tissue culture material As can be seen from Table 3, the chemical composition of the essential oil of T. polium has been studied by many researchers. In addition to T. polium itself, the subspecies aurasicum, capitatum, and polium have also been studied many times. As stated in section 3, T. polium is a plant species of Middle East origin. For this reason, most of the studies on this plant have been carried out in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Amman, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. In addition, researchers from North African countries, such as Algeria and Tunisia, have been shown to be intensely interested in this plant species. Chemical composition of the essential oil of T. polium was also analysed by several research teams in Turkey. Due to the nature of a bridge between Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a great importance in the comparison of data between east and west. In addition, essential oil compositions of samples collected from European countries such as Greece, Croatia, Bulgaria, France, Serbia and Montenegro, and islands in the Mediterranean such as Corsica and Crete were studied. In essential oil analysis, it was understood that the most ideal sample is aerial parts. In addition, flowers, fruits, inflorescence, leaves, stems, and vegetative parts have also been used in essential oil isolation. Interestingly, even tissue culture material was used to obtain the essential oil (Al-Qudah et al., 2011). Since 1982, a total of 447 essential oil components have been identified from T. polium and its subspecies. It is understood that monoterpenes such as limonene, myrcene, \u03b2\u2010Pinene, linalool, \u03b1-pinene, (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, borneol, p-cymene, sabinene, \u03b1-terpineol, \u03b1-thujene and sesquiterpenoids such as bicyclogermacrene, caryophyllene oxide, germacrene D, \u03b1-copaene, \u03b1-humulene, \uf064-cadinene, \u03b2-bourbonene, elemol, spathulenol, \uf067-cadinene are frequently identified in essential oil samples in the majority of these studies. The main components of essential oils isolated from T. polium and its subspecies were given in Table 4. Compounds with a rate of more than 5 % in the oil samples were given in the table. According to literature data, as in Table 3, the main components of the essential oil of both T. polium and its subspecies (ssp. capitatum, ssp. aurasicum, and ssp. polium) were monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes. In samples collected from Iran, Tunisia, Amman, Croatia, Algeria and Greece, almost half of the essential oils were found to be composed of carvacrol (monoterpene), \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b2-bisabolol (sesquiterpenes). In addition, \u03b2-pinene, 11-acetoxyeudesman-4-a-ol, \u03b1-bisabolol, 1,2,3,6,7,7\u03b1-hexahydro-5-h-inden-5-one, \u03b1-pinene, germacrene D, 8-cedren-13-ol, \uf067-muurolene, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b1-muurolene, piperitenone oxide, t-cadinol and (Z)-\u03b1-caryophyllene were also higher than 20% in oil samples. It was found that the major compounds mentioned above were generally determined in the oils isolated from aerial parts of the samples. The main components were also found in the leaves, inflorescences, stems, fruits, flowers, and tissue culture materials. Other components isolated from T. polium and its subspecies were given in Table 5. In addition to the subspecies given Tables 3 and 4, expansum, gnaphalodes, pilosum, aureum, and vincentinum were also among the subspecies where the compounds in Table 5 was isolated. According to the data in the table, a total of 172 compounds belonging to flavonoids, neo-clerodane diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, phenylpropanoid glycosides, iridoid glycosides, abietane diterpenoids, sterols, triterpenic alcohols, abeo-abietanes, phenylethanol glycosides, and saponin glycosides were identified. In addition to aerial parts of the plant, roots, leaves, stems, and seeds were also used for the isolation of these compounds. Solvents used in the isolation of these compounds were EtOAc, acetone, petroleum ether, chloroform, MeOH, water, n-hexane, and CH2Cl2. The most frequently isolated components in the studies presented in Table 5 were flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, cirsimaritin, routine). In addition, poliumoside, verbascoside (phenylpropanoid glycosides), teucardoside (iridoid glycoside), caffeic acid (phenolic compound) and teulamifin B (neo-clerodane diterpenoid) were also frequently identified. Aerial parts of the samples were mostly used for the isolation of these components. It was understood that the variety components in both Tables 3, 4, and 5 were not affected by the localities where the plants were collected and similar components were detected in the samples collected from both the Middle Eastern and European countries. In addition to the classification performed according to morphological and/or anatomical features, plants can also be subjected to chemical classification, taking into account chemical A. Sihoglu Tepe et al. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 27 variations. In this classification, called chemotaxonomy, the distribution of chemical compounds or biosynthetically related compound groups in plants is examined. Although traditionalist researchers insist that they do not accept chemical taxonomy against morphological classification, since ancient times, chemotaxonomic data are believed to be important, since some of the main components of essential oils have been used in the cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries (Bhargava et al., 2013). Kamel and Sandra (1994) suggested that sesquiterpenoids, particularly sesquiterpene alcohols, can be used as chemotaxonomic markers for the essential oils of T. polium. The data in Table 4 show that the suggestion that sesquiterpenes can be used as chemotaxonomic markers is correct. However, monoterpenes can also be evaluated as important chemotaxonomic markers for T. polium and its subspecies. Table 4.

It has also been suggested in the literature that phenylethanoid and iridoid glycosides can be used as chemotaxonomic markers (Mitreski et al., 2014; Venditti et al., 2017). However, in addition to these groups, flavonoids, neo-clerodane diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, and phenylpropanoid glycoside were thought to be chemotaxonomic markers for T. polium. 5. Toxicity on kidney and liver As discussed in detail in section 3, the use of T. polium among the people is very common. However, as with all herbal products consumed for various purposes, T. polium should be questioned in terms of possible toxic effects. In the literature, there are some data A. Sihoglu Tepe et al. International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 30 on the beneficial properties of this plant, as well as researchers who argue that it has various levels of toxic effects. Unfortunately, the researchers are not yet in consensus on whether T. polium has a toxic effect. Literature data on the effects of various extracts from T. polium on kidney and liver are given in Table 6 and 7. Table 5.

(2012), T. polium is a plant that can be safely consumed as it has a negligible side effect. There are other additional studies in the literature that support this claim. Al-Asmari et al. (2014) argued that T. polium has a protective effect on cultured hepatocytes due to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds and may only cause mild toxicity at high doses. According to Kiyani et al. (2011), the hydroalcoholic extract (1:1) obtained from this plant did not show any toxicity and induce hepatotoxicity. Kulevanova et al. (2006) also claims that T. polium is hepatoprotective. According to these researchers, the EtOAc extract from T. polium significantly eliminated CCI4-induced liver damage in rats. Table 6.

The extract has also been suggested to increase mitochondrial bioenergetics and suppress liver CYP2E1, GSTpi and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels. These mechanisms are thought to contribute to the hepatoprotective effect. (Baali et al., 2016) Whole plant 80% aqueous-ethanol extract ICR mice 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg 5 days Orally Doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg of T. polium extract have been reported to have a significant hepatoprotective effect.

International Journal of Plant Based Pharmaceuticals, 1(1), 1-41 37 Plant part Extract Test subject Dose Duration Method of application Result Reference administered 300 mg/kg of T. polium extract. In addition, it has been reported that weights of the livers of female rats administered 600 mg/kg extract increased significantly. In addition to the literature data presented above, there are those who claim that T. polium has toxic effect on both kidney and liver. Although nearly half of the researchers suggest that this plant has a toxic effect on the liver, it is clear that in the vast majority of studies, T. polium has a toxic effect on the kidneys. According to Alzweiri et al. (2011), the infusion prepared from T. polium leads to jaundice. The same research group argued that T. polium had a negative impact on human health due to its anorexic effect. It has also been claimed that consuming tea prepared from the aerial parts of this plant causes low birth in pregnant women (Mosaddegh et al., 2012). In addition to the results of in vivo studies, case reports were also presented in Table 7. Although consensus has not been reached in the in vivo studies regarding the toxic effect of T. polium on the liver, all clinical findings prove that this plant has a negative effect on liver function. It is stated in all case reports that T. polium toxicity is observed in everyone who consumes the tea of this herb regularly, regardless of age restriction. In the majority of cases, in addition to jaundice, serum ALT, AST, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels increased and a significant decrease in prothrombin level was observed. In patients undergoing liver biopsy, as a result of histological examination, hepatitis findings with moderate or severe necroinflammatory activity were observed (Savvidou et al., 2007). In almost all case reports, it was found that liver enzyme levels returned to normal after stopping T. polium intake. Vasileiadou et al. (2003) further suggested that after continuous or intermittent use of the plant, liver damage may occur and acute or chronic hepatitis with or without cholestasis may develop. The researchers also stated that people should not consider the use of plants without being officially informed about their possible negative effects. Table 7. Toxic effect of T. polium on kidney and liver as the case reports. Case reports Report Reference Three patients, 31, 33 and 37 years of age, admitted to the clinic due to the two years of persistent jaundice and elevated l iver enzymes. It was determined that the patients used T. polium from forty days to three months. Two of the patients continued using T. polium during their previous pregnancy periods and admitted to another clinic due to similar complaints. Liver enzyme levels returned to normal in approximately three months after the stopping of T. polium use. (Dag et al., 2014a) T. polium was found to be the main cause of liver damage in seven of ten hepatotoxic patients admitted to the clinic. (Dag et al., 2014b) It was determined that a patient who admitted to the clinic used T. polium tea for ten days in August 1992 and additional ten days in December 1992 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Jaundice appeared five days after the end of the second treatment period. In biochemical tests, a significant increase in ALT and AST levels and a decrease in prothrombin level were detected. (Mattei et al., 1995) An increase in ALT, AST, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels of a patient who consumed T. polium tea for six months for the treatment of hyperlipidemia was reported. (Mazokopakis et al., 2004) Five cases have been reported regarding the consumption of T. polium in the form of tea causing intrahepatic cholestasis. (Mazokopakis et al., 2007) Two Greek patients who used T. polium extract for two-three months to treat high cholesterol levels admitted to the clinic with high aminotransferase levels. Jaundice developed in one of the patients. As a result of histological examination of liver biopsies, moderate or severe necroinflammatory findings were detected. Discontinuation of herbal medicine treatment led to the normalization of liver enzymes in both patients. (Savvidou et al., 2007) Twin sisters of two months admitted to the emergency with vomiting complaints. It was understood that T. polium was given in the form of tea for the treatment of infantile colic by their families. The consumption of the tea in question was recommended by the neighbors. The babies were hospitalized due to possible side effects of T. polium consumption. ALT and AST levels were found to be high. (Sezer and Bozaykut, 2012) A 70-year-old farmer applied to the clinic for liver disease. The patient stated that he consumed approximately one-two liters of T. polium tea a day. As a result of biochemical analysis, the patient's ALT, AST and bilirubin levels were found to be high. (Starakis et al., 2006) Between 2000-2002, five patients were hospitalized. It was learned that three of these patients used T. polium for the treatment of diabetes and two of them for hyperlipidemia. Three of the patients used the plant occasionally and two of them used regularly every day for one month. Liver biopsy revealed acute hepatitis in two patients and chronic hepatitis with low grade cholestasis in the other two patients. (Vasileiadou et al., 2003) According to Rafieian-Kopaei et al. (2014), it has been reported that the pro-oxidant activity of some antioxidants may cause toxicity through oxidative stress. According to Chitturi and Farrell (2008), which claims that T. polium is the first plant to be proven to cause acute liver failure, some diterpenoid-derived reactive metabolites are the main components responsible for hepatotoxicity. Today, T. polium toxicity is thought to be caused mainly by neo-clerodane diterpenoids (Venditti et al., 2017). 6. Conclusions In this review, the traditional use, phytochemistry and toxic effects of T. polium on kidney and liver were documented. It was understood that the plant has been used frequently by many people in many parts of the world since ancient times in the treatment of certain diseases. However, literature data showed that T. polium has toxic effect on kidney tissue. Moreover, in some of the studies on the liver and in all clinical reports, T. polium has also been proven to have toxic effect on the liver. Although it is difficult to change the traditional consumption habits of the people, it has been concluded that more attention should be paid to the use of the plant. As evaluated in detail in the sections above, the plant species in question has been frequently used by humans in the treatment of various diseases (especially gastrointestinal system disorders) since ancient times. It is thought that awareness of the possible harms of this plant should be created in people by providing sufficient information. As clearly stated by Rafieian-Kopaei et al. (2014), more clinical studies are required to better understand the effects of T. polium on the liver. In particular, the effects of the plant on ALT, AST, bilirubin, and prothrombin levels should be documented in more detail, and the histological changes on the liver tissue should be followed as a result of the use of the plant. It was also concluded that that regular consumption of T. polium should be avoided for long periods of time. Acknowledgements None. A. Sihoglu Tepe et al.
