The applicationof Huangqi can be traced back to the Han Dynasty and was firstrecorded in Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Han Dynasty, BCE 202\u2013220),where it was categorized as a high-quality product. Li Shizhen\u2019s\u201cCompendium of the Materia Medica\u201d (Ming Dynasty, AD1552\u20131578) lists Huangqi as the first tonic herb, which mainlyreinforced healthy qi, dispelling pathogenic factors, promotingdiuresis, and reducing swelling. Huangqi has been prevalent formore than 2,000 years with over 200 types of herbal decoctions andhas experienced extensive clinical application in Chinese medicine(Yuan et al., 2012).The chemical composition of Astragalus is complex and mainlyincludes flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharide compounds, as well asamino acids and trace elements (Wang et al., 2021a). To date, more than200 compounds have been isolated from Astragalus species, amongwhich isoflavones such as calycosin (CAL), calycosin-7-glucoside (CG),formononetin (FMN), and ononin (ON) have significant value becauseof their significant antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, andneuroprotective pharmacological effects (Jin et al., 2014; Yu et al.,2018b). Modern pharmacological studies have verified that Huangqihas various pharmacological activities, which can improve the body\u2019simmunity; scavenge free radicals; and exert anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant effects (Wu et al., 2016). Theaqueous extracts of Huangqi are often used separately or in combinationwith other drugs to expand the range of its medicinal effects. Forexample, the combined use of Astragalus and Angelica in Angelicablood tonic soup can improve the deficiency of both qi and blood (Ninget al., 2002). In addition, Huangqi is rich in Astragalus polysaccharides(Shi et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2015), which can treat severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. The combination ofHuangqi and Lonicera japonica Thunb. has exhibited significant anti-SARS-CoV2 activity (Yeh et al., 2021). Safety evaluation studies on thetoxicological effects of Huangqi have also received extensive attention.The main factors responsible for its pharmacological effects are closelyrelated to its complex chemical composition and chemical-componentinteractions. Moreover, its wide range of biological activities makesHuangqi an extremely valuable medicinal resource.As a rare botanical, Huangqi has attracted much attentionbecause of its unique medicinal value and health effects. Atpresent, the research on Huangqi mainly focuses on its chemicalcomposition and pharmacological activity. However, there is a lackof comprehensive and up-to-date information about Huangqi. Inthis study, the literature on Huangqi since 1983 was collected, andthe duplicated and irrelevant literature was removed. This reviewsystematically summarized the literature on the botany,phytochemistry, traditional uses, pharmacology, toxicology, andquality control of Huangqi. This review aims to comprehensivelyand objectively understand Huangqi, solve the problems in itsapplication, explore its inherent potential, and provide new ideasfor future innovative research and the search for new drugs.BotanyAstragalus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, SouthAmerica, and Africa; is rare in North America and Oceania; and is usedas an ethnomedicine in the Russian Federation, Korea, Mongolia,Kazakhstan, and China (Figure 1). Astragalus membranaceus has thefollowing morphological features: stems 60\u2013150 cm tall, villous; leavespinnately compound; leaflets 21\u201331mm, ovate-lanceolate or elliptic,7\u201330 mm long, 4\u201310mmwide, white villous on both surfaces; leaf rachisvillous; stipules narrowly lanceolate, 4\u20136 mm white villous; racemesaxillary; flowers with striated bracts below; ovary hairy with an ovarystalk; pods membranous, swollen, ovate-tortuous, long-stalked, blackpubescent (Figures 2B, D).Red indicates the use and distribution areasof Huang Q in the world, and blue indicatesno distributionAstragalus mongholicus is smaller than the original variety, withsmaller leaflets (5\u201310mm long and 3\u20135mm wide) and glabrous podsand grows in an environment similar to that ofA.membranaceus, such assunny grasslands, thickets, and mountain slopes. The roots of thesespecies can be used as a medicine andmake a strong tonic that nourishesthe kidneys, tonifies the spleen, prevents sweating, expels excess water,and eliminates swelling and pus. A. mongholicus grows on forest edges,thickets, sparse forests, meadows, and mountain slopes and is one of themost commonly used Chinese herbs (Figure 2A, C).Astragalus flowers inJune\u2013August and produces fruits in July\u2013September. Good qualityAstragalus plants are harvested at 4\u20135 years of age; transplantedseedlings can be harvested after 3 years. Plants can be harvested inautumn (August\u2013September), after the branches and leaves wither, or inspring (March\u2013April), before the plant sprouts. Plants are dug out afterremoving the soil and the stems, seedlings, and roots are cut off and driedin the Sun until they have dried by 60% or 70%. Then, they are arrangedinto small bundles stacked up together, natural pan sugar is added,sundried until soft, rubbed by hand, and then sundried completely (Sun,2015). Research has revealed that the best harvesting period forAstragalusis from late October to mid-November when it has the highest yield, thebest traits, and the best quality. The best time to harvest Huangqi is on asunny day, and the entire root should be dug deeply to prevent the qualityfrom being reduced through the breakage of the main root. The cleaningmethod of Huangqi greatly influences the content of the activeingredients, such as astragaloside IV and GC (Tang, 2022).PhytochemistryTo date, more than 200 compounds have been isolated fromAstragalus species, including flavonoids, triterpenoids,polysaccharides, amino acids, alkaloids, \u00df-sitosterol, metalloids,and anthraquinones Supplementary Tables S1, S2. Among these,flavonoids and triterpenoids are the most abundant andpolysaccharides, isoflavonoids, and triterpenoid saponins are themain active compounds of Huangqi responsible for its variouspharmacological properties; these chemical components havebeen extensively studied (Song et al., 2007).FlavonoidsMore than 100 flavonoid compounds have been isolated from A.membranaceus, with isoflavones, flavonoids, isoflavanes, andpterocarpans as the four major groups (Zhang et al., 2021a).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318Based on their structures, flavonoids can be divided into flavonols,flavones, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanins, isoflavones, dihydroflavonols, and chalcones. Isoflavones are the most abundant amongthem, accounting for 80% of the total flavonoid content and are thesignature Huangqi flavonoid compound (Huang et al., 2009). FMNand CAL, two important isoflavones in Huangqi, have been widelystudied for their multiple pharmacological functions (Gao et al.,2014). CG has been demonstrated to possess variouspharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities (Choi et al., 2007;FIGURE 1World map of Huangqi distribution.FIGURE 2(A) A. mongholicu above ground parts; (B) A. membranaceus above ground parts; (C) A. mongholicus dry roots; (D) A. membranaceus dry roots.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318Jian et al., 2015). More importantly, CG has been described as achemical indicator for the quality control of Huangqi in the ChinesePharmacopoeia (2020).SaponinsAstragalus is rich in saponins, with triterpene saponins beingthe unique bioactive compounds. Saponins such as astragalosideI-VIII, isoastragaloside I-II, acetyl astragaloside, and soysaponin l and more than 100 triterpenoids have been isolatedfrom Astragalus (Kitagawa et al., 1983a; Kitagawa et al., 1983b;Wang et al., 1983; Guo et al., 2019). Further, severalcyclohexane-type tetracyclic triterpenes and oleanolane-typepentacyclic triterpenes, which are triterpene glycosides thatcontain a 30 carbon-atom skeleton, have been isolated fromAstragalus. Astragalosides I, II, and IV are the most abundantsaponins isolated from Astragalus roots. Astragaloside IV, whichhas significant pharmacological activities, has been studiedextensively and described as one of the important indicatorsfor the quality control of Huangqi in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia(Choi et al., 2007; Qi et al., 2008).PolysaccharidesMore than 30 types of Astragalus polysaccharide, one of themain components in Huangqi, have been isolated from Astragalus,which are mainly divided into dextrans and heteropolysaccharides(Guo et al., 2019). Additionally, rhamnose, xylose, glucose,galactose, mannose, and alcohol-soluble polysaccharide (ASP)have been isolated from Astragalus. Alcohol-solublepolysaccharide is a neutral polysaccharide composed of mannose,glucose, galactose, and arabinose with pyranose rings and \u03b1-glycosidic bonds (Yu et al., 2018a). Recently, a new soluble sugarnamed APS4 has been isolated from Astragalus. The averagemolecular weight of APS4, composed of rhamnose, arabinose,xylose, mannose, and galactose, is approximately 1.5 \u00d7 103 kDa,as revealed using high-performance gel permeationchromatography. APS4 has been demonstrated to have potentialapplications in cancer therapy (Yu et al., 2019).OthersAstragalus species also contain molybdenum, copper,manganese, scandium, rubidium, selenium, chromium,cobalt, cesium, iron, zinc, and more than 20 trace elements;however, the iron, manganese, zinc, and aluminum contents arehigher than those of the others (Fu et al., 2014). In addition,Astragalus species contains 20 amino acids, including arginine,aspartic acid, asparagine, proline, and alanine (Shao et al.,2004). Further, other compounds such as folic acid, palmiticacid, bitter elements, coumarin, chloric acid, coumaric acid,choline, linolenic acid, legume sterols, ferulic acid, isoferulicacid, hydroxyphenyl acrylic acid, deerskinol, betaine, caffeicacid, linoleic acid, and \u03b2-sitosterol have also been identifiedfrom Astragalus species.Traditional usesHuangqi is named so because of its yellow color and significanttonic potential. Huangqi contains various active ingredients andthus has a wide range of pharmacological effects, playing animportant role in traditional Chinese medicine. Huangqisupplements the qi, solidifies the surface, benefits water, supportstoxins, and generates muscles. As a traditional Chinese medicine, itis mainly used for treating spleen and stomach weakness, qideficiency and blood withdrawal, qi deficiency and edema,chronic nephritis, ulcers, or ulcers that remain uncured. InChina, it is known as the \u201cLittle Ginseng of Northeast China\u201d(Napolitano et al., 2013). The Dictionary of Traditional ChineseMedicine records that Huangqi is taken in a decoction of 9\u201315 g.Large doses include 30\u201360 g (Li, 2005). It is suitable for stir-bakingwith an adjuvant to tonify and replenish the middle qi and used rawto secure the exterior, induce diuresis, and expel toxins. Huangqi hasbeen used clinically in a variety of classical prescriptions. Relatedformulations of Huangqi with other herbs are shown in Table 1.Huangqi has a long history and is widely used in classicalformulations. Huangqi was first recorded as a high grade herb in theShennong Ben Cao Jing I\u795e\u519c\u672c\u8349\u7ecfJ (Han Dynasty, BCE 202\u2013220),and Li Shizhen\u2019s Compendium of Materia Medica I\u672c\u8349\u7eb2\u76eeJ (MingDynasty, AD 1552\u20131578) lists Huangqi as the leading tonic medicine. InZhang Zhongjing\u2019s the Golden Chamber I\u91d1\u532e\u8981\u7565J (Eastern HanDynasty, AD 200\u2013210), the dosage and preparation of differentmedicinal formulations are described in detail, and Huangqi ismentioned in eight of these formulations: Huangqi Gui Zhi WuwuTang, Huangqi Jianzhong Tang, Fangji Huangqi Tang, Fangji Gui ZhiTang, Wutou Tang, Gui Zhi Tang, Huangqi Peony Bitter Wine Tang,and Qianjin Sanhuang Tang.However, there are no records ofprescribing Huangqi for febrile diseases I\u4f24\u5bd2\u8bbaJ (Dong HanDynasty, AD 25\u2013220). In the Secret Record of the Chamber ofOrchids I\u5170\u5ba4\u79d8\u85cfJ (Yuan Dynasty, AD 1115\u20131368), written by LiDong Yuan, Huangqi is mentioned 19 times as a tonifying agent of thespleen (Liu et al., 2022). In NeiWai Shang Bian Huo Lun I\u5185\u5916\u4f24\u8fa9\u60d1\u8bbaJ (Yuan Dynasty, AD 1232\u20131247), Huangqi is mentioned 11 times ingrouping frequency and nine times in combination with ginseng for itseffectiveness in benefiting the qi and strengthening the spleen. Huangqiis mentioned 15 times in the Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach I\u813e\u80c3\u8bbaJ (Yuan Dynasty, AD 1249) as an agent widely used to tonify thedeficiencies of the spleen and stomach. Wu Jutong wroteWarmDiseaseArgument I\u6e29\u75c5\u6761\u8fa9J (Qing Dynasty, A.D. 1644\u20131911), where inaddition to borrowing Qingshu Yiqi Tang and Buzhong Yiqi Tang andformulating his own formula, he only used the addition and subtractionof Buzhong Yiqi Tang to treat \u201cQi deficiency and lower trapping, theportal does not hide.\u201d According to Wang Qingren, Huangqi is thepreferred qi tonic for treating Yuan Qi deficiency. In 11 of the33 prescriptions in the Medical Forest Correction I\u533b\u6797\u6539\u9519J (QingDynasty, AD 1830), Huangqi has beenmentioned as themost abundantagent (Sha, 2014). Jing Yue advocated warm tonicity and proposed theidea of \u201cYang Fei You Yu.\u201d He used qi tonicity in several formulas,includingHuangqi in 42 of the 132 formulas (Yi, 2013). In the OrthodoxManual of External Medicine I\u5916\u79d1\u6b63\u5b97J (Ming Dynasty, AD 1617),Huangqi appears 10 times among 32 main treatment formulas forswollen ulcers. Chen Yuren believed that swollen ulcers were caused by\u201cweakness of the spleen and stomach and weakened Yang Qi,\u201d andHuangqi was used in the formulas to nourish qi deficiency andFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318strengthen the spleen (Zhao et al., 2018). Huangqi appears 25 times as atonic for deficiency, thirst, sores, and fractures in the Prescription ofPeaceful BenevolentDispensary I\u592a\u5e73\u60e0\u6c11\u548c\u5242\u5c40\u65b9J (MingDynasty,A.D. 1078\u20131085), written by the Song Dynasty Hodong Bureau (Wang,2021).In addition to the studies on Huangqi in classical medicine, ithas been extensively studied recently. In Records of ChineseMedicine with Reference to Western MedicineI\u533b\u5b66\u8877\u4e2d\u53c2\u897f\u5f55J, Zhang Xichun mentioned Huangqi 35 times for its tonicpower that promotes myogenesis, solid qi, diuresis and preventsthe collapse of the belt. He also created four formulas of ShengxianTang, all with Huangqi as the leading substance, that tonify andincrease the qi and treat qi trapped in the chest. Zhang Xichunbelieved that some drugs need to be used raw to obtain the completebenefits of the medicine, and heating weakens concoctions, makingthem ineffective or may even cause them to have the opposite effect.TABLE 1 Traditional and clinical uses of Huangqi in China.NO.

In recent years, astragalus isoflavones have beenwidely used because of their anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor,treatment of heart diseases, treatment of neurological diseases,anti-diabetic, and Anti-oxidant effects This review discusses thepharmacological effects of the isoflavone compounds in AstragalusFigure 3 and Table 2 to assist further scientific research.Anti-inflammatoryInflammation is a defensive response of the body to the externalstimuli and is characterized by redness, swelling, fever, pain, anddysfunction. Bacteria such as rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, spirochetes,fungi, and parasites are the most common causes of inflammation(Yang et al., 2021). Modern pharmacology has demonstrated thatAstragalus isoflavones have anti-inflammatory effects, the mainsubstances of which are FMN and CAL. Yu Ping Feng San(YPFS) is a traditional Chinese medicinal decoction widely usedto treat atopic dermatitis (AD). The active ingredients CAL andFMN extracted from YPFS can reduce epidermal thickening at theinitial stage of sensitization alone, and they inhibit thymic stromallymphopoietin (TSLP) by regulating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)activation and translocation, thereby reducing allergicinflammation. This confirms the anti-inflammatory activity ofFMN and CAL(Shen et al., 2014).Numerous anti-inflammatory studies have demonstrated thatdrugs usually exert their anti-inflammatory effects by modulatingthe expression of nuclear factors and \u03baB inhibitors such as NF-\u03baB,Interleukin (IL-1\u03b2/6/33), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), thymic stromal lymphopoietin(TSLP), and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1\u03b1). A studyadministered FMN to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-inducedAD mice and FITC-treated HaCaT cells followed by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or lipopolysaccharide treatment and reported thatTSLP/IL-33 levels were reduced in vitro and in vivo whereasE-calcine mucin levels were increased in vitro (Li et al., 2018).This may be because FMN reduces TSLP/IL-33 production whilealleviating the inflammatory response by regulating E-calcinemucin. Moreover, FMN can alleviate AD by promoting theupregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 3(A20) expression by siGPER. FMN significantly increases theexpression of A20 protein and mRNA while suppressing theexpression of TSLP protein and mRNA (Yuan et al., 2021). FMNinhibits the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines inosteoarthritis (AO), as well as the expression of cyclooxygenase-2and nitric oxide synthase, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) and thrombomodulin. This mechanisminvolves the activation of phosphatases and the inhibition of IL-1\u03b2-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and protein kinase B (AKT) (Jia et al.,2022). CAL has been found to ameliorate lung injury andinflammatory response in mice with pneumonia caused byFIGURE 3Six pharmacological effects of Huangqi.

The mechanism may be relatedto the inhibition of NF\u2043\u03baB signaling pathway activation. CAL acts onAO by inhibiting IL-1\u03b2 protein-induced activation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling (Guo et al., 2022); it can mitigate sepsis-inducedacute lung injury through the HMGB1/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway andactivation of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles (Chen et al., 2021). HIF-1\u03b1may be a therapeutic target in AD when CAL is used to treat AD.CAL can inhibit HIF-1 \u03b1 expression both in vivo and in vitro; itdownregulates HIF-1 \u03b1 expression in HaCaT cells to repair tightjunctions and reduce allergic inflammation (Jia et al., 2018).Anti-tumorTumors arise from the proliferation of local tissue cells affectedby various tumorigenic factors in the body. Tumors are classified asbenign and malignant, and cancer is a type of malignant tumor thatoriginates from epithelial tissue. According to the studies conductedin the last decade, FMN and CAL can treat oncological diseases,including lung (Yang et al., 2014), breast (Yu et al., 2017), colorectal(Hu et al., 2023), ovarian (Yao et al., 2019), and gastric cancers(Zhou et al., 2015), via various molecular pathways. Theirmechanism of anti-tumor action includes inhibition of cellproliferation, influence on the cell cycle, and induction of apoptosis.Multiple pathways to inhibit tumor cellproliferationThe four isoflavone extracts of Huangqi, GC, CAL, FMN, andON, have been found to inhibit the proliferation of SK-BR-3, MCF-7, andMDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as well as todecrease the levels of p-GS3K \u03b2, p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR andsubstantial increase total mTOR levels (Zhou et al., 2018).Additionally, CAL can regulate the circ_0001946/miR-21/GPD1L/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling axis in a dose-dependent manner. miR-21 is themost recognized and significant miRNA associated withcarcinogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of manycancers (Huang et al., 2013). CAL downregulates miR-21 at circ_0001946 and GPD1L levels and upregulates HIF-1\u03b1 levels in lungadenocarcinoma cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion,migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) processes(Zhou et al., 2018). Extracellular regulatory protein kinase 1/2(ERK1/2) can enter the nucleus to promote the transcription andexpression of certain genes and is closely related to cell proliferationand differentiation. FMN can act by inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathwayand inactivating laminin A/C in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)cells. Further, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), ERK1/2, laminin A/C, andCK19 expressions have been found to be downregulated in FMN-treated NPC CNE2 cells, whereas intracellular Bax expression iselevated, indicating an inhibition of cell proliferation (Ying et al.,2019).Influence on the cell cycle through multiplepathwaysCAL can inhibit breast cancer cell growth by regulating AKTsignaling pathway, inducing the activation of MAPK, STAT3, NF-\u03baB, and related apoptotic proteins and reducing the expression levelsof TGF-\u03b21, SMAD2/3, and SLUG to arrest the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase (Zhou et al., 2018). CAL inhibits Bcl-2 expression andpromotes Bax, caspase-3, PARP, TGF-\u03b21, SMAD2/3, and SLUGexpressions by blocking the growth of hepatocellular carcinomaBEL-7402 cell line in G0/G1 phase. In addition, CAL inducesMAPK, STAT3, NF-\u03baB, and related apoptotic proteins inHepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating AKTpathway protein activation to induce G0/G1 phase cell cyclearrest (Liu et al., 2021b). Furthermore, FMN inhibits coloncancer (SW1116 and HCT116) cell growth through miR-149-induced downregulation of EphB3 and inhibition of PI3K/AKTand STAT3 signaling pathways to downregulate cell cycle-associatedprotein Cyclin D1 expression and block the cell cycle at the G0/G1 point (Wang et al., 2018a). FMN induces G1 phase arrest inMCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells bydownregulating the expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E andnegatively regulating the expression of P21 and P27 (Zhou et al.,2016).Induction of apoptosis through multiple pathwaysFMN has been shown to alleviate ovarian cancer in SKOV-3cells by increasing E-cadherin expression and decreasing MMP-9expression, which inhibits the cancer cell proliferation, migration,and invasion (Gu et al., 2020). Further studies have demonstratedthat FMN causes apoptosis in SKOV-3 cells. The anti-tumor effect ofFMN is achieved by regulating the miR-19b-3p/TGF-\u03b2/Smad2 signaling pathway (Niu et al., 2021). The Bcl-2 proteinfamily significantly inhibits apoptosis, and FMN shows a dose-dependent inhibition of Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3/9 proteinexpressions in ovarian cancer cells, thereby exhibiting anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and invasive effects. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio has been found to increase after FMN treatment, whereascaspase-3 and caspase-9 levels are elevated (Lee et al., 2018). CALinduces p21Waf1/Cip1 cycle arrest and promotes caspase apoptosisand MIA PaCa-2 cell migration in macrophages RAW 264.7, whichoccurs through the induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway andpromotion of M2 tumor-associated macrophages acting in thetumor microenvironment (Zhang et al., 2020). CAL can reducethe viability of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells through targetedinhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and upregulation ofPhosphatase gene (PTEN) protein and estrogen receptor \u00df (Er\u03b2),thereby inducing CRC cell apoptosis. PTEN and ER\u03b2 proteinexpressions are significantly upregulated in CRC cells subjectedto CAL, whereas p-AKT/AKT ratio and Bcl-2 levels aredownregulated, confirming the anti-tumor effect of CAL(Zhanget al., 2021b). FMN induces apoptosis in OGS cells and inhibitsthe growth of solid tumors, resulting in an increase in intracellularApaf-1 positive cells and a decrease in endogenous Ki-67,p-PI3KCATyr317, and p-AKTSer473 immune cells. Themechanism of action is related to the inactivation of miR-375/ER\u03b1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cells (Hu et al., 2019).Treatment of heart diseasesCardiovascular diseases account for approximately17.5 million deaths worldwide annually, it is crucial to screenfor effective therapeutic agents against these diseases (Xin et al.,2013). The most common and critical heart diseases includehypertension, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmia, whichcan occur independently or in combination with other heartdiseases. Astragalus isoflavones have anti-apoptotic, autophagy-Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318promoting, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant roles in heartdiseases.CAL can inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis by promoting theactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby reducingmyocardial injury. High-dose CG pretreatment has been shown tosignificantly improve cardiac function in rats, with the upregulationof superoxide dismutase (SOD), Ejection Fraction (EF), fractionalshortening (FS), and left ventricular end-systolic pressure anddownregulation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure andmalonaldehyde (MDA). Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities werealso inhibited (Ren et al., 2016). Further studies revealed that CGmay mitigate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by upregulating IL-10 to activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (Liu et al., 2020).Using isolated heart tissues from senescent mice and chemicallyinduced senescent H9C2 cells as experimental subjects, a studydemonstrated that FMN can attenuate I/R-induced apoptosis in cellsor tissues (Huang et al., 2018b). Additionally, FMN can inhibit theactivation of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inrats and improve IR in rats via the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-TXNIP-NLRP3 signaling pathway (Wang et al., 2020a). CALprotects the heart by eliminating histopathological changes owingto its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-lipidperoxidation activities. CAL may exert cardioprotective effects bymodulating the Sirt1-NLRP3 pathway, thereby amelioratingadriamycin/adriamycin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity, reducingapoptosis and inhibiting oxidative stress. CAL may also be usefulin the treatment of myocardial infarction to reduce cardiacdysfunction and its associated complications (Huang et al., 2020).CAL induces apoptosis through the Bcl-2, Bax, and PI3K-Aktsignaling pathways and increases H9C2 cell viability. In addition,CAL has been shown to improve Sirt1-NLRP3 levels in cells andmouse hearts. CAL can improve cardiac function in adult zebrafishand restore autophagy through atg7 autophagy-mediatedproduction of protection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (Luet al., 2021). Zhang et al. established a cardiotoxicity model usingDOX stimulation in H9C2 cells and C57BL/6J mice. Thecardioprotective mechanism was confirmed using in vivo and exvivo experiments, which showed that CAL alleviated DOX-inducedcardiotoxicity by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammatoryvesicles (Zhang et al., 2022).Treatment of neurological diseasesNeurological diseases are pathological conditions that negativelyaffect the peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, and/or brain,ultimately leading to functional disorders (Gunata et al., 2020;Cao et al., 2023). Its etiology is complex and includes trauma,infection, genetics, tumors, immunology, and several otherfactors that can lead to neurological dysfunction, resulting inneurological diseases. Several studies have demonstrated theneuroprotective properties of FMN and CAL against cerebralischemia, dementia, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer\u2019s disease,anxiety, and depression. The pathways involved in theseneuroprotective mechanisms are ERPI3K-Akt, PI3K/AKT/ERK,and ROS-TXNIP-NLRP3 pathways. The neuroprotective effect offive Astragalus isoflavone compounds on xanthine (XA)/xanthineoxidase (XO)-induced damage in PC12 cells has been investigated.The reduction of SOD, antioxidant glutathione peroxidase, andenzymatic activities is prevented in isoflavone-treated cells; theseneuroprotective effects may be produced by increasing endogenousantioxidants (Yu et al., 2009). FMN can promote the expression ofNGF, GAP-43, BDNF, p-Trk A, p-Trk B, p-ERK 1/2, and p-AKT byincreasing the number of neuronal dendritic spines and \u00df III-microtubulin, with the best effect at 30 mg/kg (Wu et al., 2020).CAL treatment in stroke patients increases brain BDNF/TrkBexpression, ameliorates neurological damage, and transformsmicroglia from an activated amoeboid state to a restingbranching state. BDNF/TrkB -mediated CAL amelioratesischemic stroke injury in rats by switching microglia from anactivated to a resting branching state (Hsu et al., 2020). Thepathogenic mechanisms underlying I/R include elevatedintracellular Ca2+ levels, excitatory neurotransmitter release,oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (Durukan andTatlisumak, 2007). CAL has neuroprotective effects in I/R rats,significantly reducing the brain water content and improvingneurological deficits. The mechanism of action may be related tothe positive feedback regulation of miR-375 through ER-\u03b1 (Wanget al., 2014b). The effect of CAL on I/R may be related to its anti-autophagic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Astudy established an I/R rat model with middle cerebral arteryocclusion and reported that CAL pretreatment for 14 dayssignificantly reduced brain edema and improved neurologicalfunction in I/R rats, as well as significantly upregulated theexpression of Bcl-2, p62, and NBR1 and downregulated the levelof tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (Wang et al., 2018b). FMNaction in I/R rats reduces ASC, p-STAT3, p-JAK2, NLRP3, cl-IL-1\u03b2,and cl-caspase-1 protein levels in the brain tissue of rats with infarctvolume. The neuroprotective effect of FMN is achieved through theinhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (Yu et al., 2022).FMN reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and oxidative stress inrats, improves depression-like behavior in rats with mild stress(CUMS)-induced depression, and reverses the CUMS-induceddecrease in nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)protein and increase in NQO\u20431 and HO\u20431 proteins in thenucleus (Yao et al., 2022). CAL may also be effective againstcerebral hemorrhage-induced injury by inhibiting oxidativedamage and inflammatory responses, and 50 mg/kg CAL hasbeen shown to significantly inhibit ischemic brain injury. Lesionvolume, blood volume, and hemispheric enlargement aresignificantly reduced after CAL treatment. CAL likely inhibitsoxidative stress by enhancing the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway andsuppresses the inflammatory response by blocking the activation ofNACHT, NALP3 inflammatory vesicles, and NF-\u03baB pathway (Chenet al., 2020).Astragalus isoflavones alleviate I/R by activating the ER-PI3K-Akt pathway, which may be a molecular target for synergisticneuroprotection by Astragalus isoflavones (Gu et al., 2021).Anti-diabeticDiabetes is a chronic endocrine disease characterized by glucose,fat, and protein metabolism disorders caused by insulin deficiency,insulin insensitivity, or both, which can lead to the damage anddysfunction of various organs in the body (Krasteva et al., 2014).Type 1 diabetes is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency,whereas type 2 diabetes is characterized by relative insulindeficiency and insulin resistance. CAL ameliorates advancedFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318glycation end products (AGEs)-induced impairment of hepatocyteviability and AGEs-induced dysfunction of hepatocyte glucoseuptake in a dose-dependent manner (Xu et al., 2015). Thecombined application of FMN, CAL, and Tetrandrine has beendemonstrated to be effective against hyperglycemia andhypoinsulinemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice(Ma et al., 2007); this is because FMN and CAL can enhance thehypoglycemic effect of Tetrandrine. In another study, FMNsignificantly reduced the fasting blood glucose levels at doses of5, 10, and 20 mg/kg in alloxan-induced type 1 diabetes mice,indicating that FMN promotes islet B cell regeneration, insulinsecretion, and liver glycogen synthesis by inhibiting islet B cellapoptosis (Qiu et al., 2016). FMN can also treat STZ-induced type2 diabetes. Significant improvement in the fasting blood glucoselevels has been observed after 40 mg/kg FMN treatment of rats, andFMN at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg can significantly reduce serumurea nitrogen, glucose, albumin, and creatinine levels. Further, FMNcan significantly increase lipid peroxidation and SOD levels andreduce renal peroxidase activity, cytokine levels, inflammatorychanges, and renal cell necrosis, thereby protecting pancreatic \u00df-cells from necrosis and degeneration (Jain et al., 2020).Anti-oxidantRecent studies have reported that Huangqi extract has strongantioxidant activity and may act as a free radical scavenger, therebyalleviating the symptoms of oxidative stress in the early stages ofdiabetic nephropathy. Some studies have discovered that CAL andGC have significant anti-lipid peroxidation activity (Kim et al.,2003). FMN, CAL, and CA, isolated from Huangqi, have beenfound to significantly inhibit XA/XO-induced cell damage; theyhave significant superoxide anion and free radical (DPPH) radicalscavenging abilities, which can effectively inhibit cell damage causedby XA and XO. Among these compounds, CAL has the mostprominent antioxidant activity (Yu et al., 2005). Studies havereported that Huangqi extract can improve blood lipid levels,inhibit lipid peroxidation, increase the activity of antioxidantenzymes, and reduce the risk of hyperlipidemia and oxidativestress-related coronary heart disease in humans (Ma et al., 2011).In addition, the combination of CAL with gallic acid cansignificantly inhibit increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activitydue to isoproterenol (ISO) (Cheng et al., 2015). Oxidative stress-induced brain cell damage is an important factor in the pathogenesisof ROS-related nervous system diseases. Astrocytes are importantimmunocompetent brain cells that play a role in various nervoussystem diseases. CAL regulates oxidative stress through the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thereby preventing oxidative damage in brainastrocytes. CAL-treated cells exhibit enhanced viability, inhibition ofROS and inflammatory factor production, increased SODexpression, and dose-dependent inhibition of H2O2-induceddamage (Lu et al., 2022). CAL was found to exert antioxidanteffects by restoring SOD/CAT activity and reducing ROS contentand caspase-3 activity in a Parkinson\u2019s disease model, therebyaltering \u03b1-syn amyloid-induced neurotoxicity (Pan et al., 2021).In an allergic asthma model, treatment with FMN (10, 20, and40 mg/kg) and the positive control drug dexamethasone (2 mg/kg)decreased ROS activity and increased SOD activity increased. Theoxidation-related signaling molecules involved in this action arec-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), NF-\u03baB, and the transcription factorNrf2(Yi et al., 2020).Other pharmacological effectsAstragalus isoflavones also exhibit antiviral, estrogen-like,antibacterial, hepatoprotective, and immune-enhancing effects.Isoflavones have a molecular structure similar to that of estrogenand can therefore bind to estrogen receptors; hence, they areclassified as phytoestrogens. CAL has a protective effect on theliver of mice with acute immune liver injury caused by concanavalinA (ConA) (Liang et al., 2018), likely because of its antioxidant effecton free radicals and the enhancement of estrogen-like effects bypromoting hepatic ER expression. FMN may enhance estrogen-likeeffects by promoting estrogen receptor protein expression (El-Bakoush and Olajide, 2018) and exert antimicrobial effects byattenuating the cytotoxic and inflammatory response ofStreptococcus suis in vitro; lysozyme could be an ideal targetagainst this pathogen (Wang et al., 2020b). Further, FMN hasanti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects on the liver mainlyby inhibiting the expression of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB-p65, TLR3, andNLRP3 and upregulating Bcl-2. It also exerts anti-metabolism-related effects on fatty liver disease through lipophagy (Liu et al.,2021a). CAL exhibits hepatoprotective functions mainly by affectingthe expression of STAT3, FXR, a-SMA, and ER\u03b25, which in turnregulates free fatty acid \u00df-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, triglyceridesynthesis, glucose metabolism, collagen deposition, andhydroxyproline content (Duan et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2018).ToxicologyAlthough Astragalus has been widely used in clinical practice forseveral years, comprehensive safety and toxicity assessments havenot yet been conducted. Studies on the toxicology of Astragalus havelong been of interest to researchers, especially those focusing on thetherapeutic toxicity of secondary metabolites of Astragalus.Astragalus species can be classified into three main categoriesbased on their toxic effects on animals: species that cansynthesize aliphatic nitro compounds, species that can causemadder poisoning, and species that can accumulate selenium(Rios and Waterman, 1997). Toxicological studies onastragaloside have shown that it is toxic above a dose of1.0 mL/kg to some embryos as well as mothers. However, nospecific toxicities such as acute toxicity, subacute or subchronictoxicity, genotoxicity, or immunotoxicity have been observed(Jiangbo et al., 2009). The extract of Astragalus, historicallyrecognized as a traditional medicine and food, has now beenevaluated for its subchronic toxicity and genotoxic safety as amodern dietary ingredient, along with the triterpene glycosidiccyclic element astragalinol (Szabo, 2014). Rats were administeredastragalol at 0, 40, 80, and 150 mg/kg/day for 91 consecutive days,but no treatment-related deaths or cardiac effects were observed. Ina toxicity study on Huangqi extract, acute and subchronic oraltoxicity tests were performed on rats. In acute toxicity studies, asingle dose can reach up to 5,000 mg/kg. In a 13-week subchronicFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318toxicity study based on clinical symptoms, body weight, and autopsyresults, there were no deaths or toxic reactions (Song et al., 2017).Huangqi can be used for food health and consumed for a long timeat standard doses. Because Astragalus species may be contaminatedwith pesticides or heavy metals during cultivation, leading toincreased safety concerns (Jiaojiao et al., 2019) and reducing itsvalue, it is important to control the use of pesticides and conduct soilquality testing.In addition, the combination of Huangqi can achieve the effectof increasing efficiency and reducing toxicity. Apatinib mesylatecombined with astragaloside can significantly inhibit the growth ofhepatocellular carcinoma transplantation tumors in nude mice,promote the apoptosis of transplantation tumor cells, and causeinhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion ofHCC cells (Sun et al., 2023). Astragaloside (Peng et al., 2017),astragaloside (Lina et al., 2022) and doxorubicin can alleviatecardiotoxicity and improve anti-tumor effect. The combination ofastragaloside and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)can reduce the degree of proteinuria and delay the progression ofdiabetic kidney injury in mice (Li et al., 2021). The aboveexperimental results indicate that the combination of Huangqiactive ingredients with other drugs has shown certain advantagesin basic research, but the mechanism of its efficiency and toxicityreduction needs to continue to be explored. Although the safety ofHuangqi has been heavily formalized, independent studies onHuangqi are still lacking, and further in vitro and clinical trialsare required for confirmation.Quality controlAnalysis methodsMisidentification and adulteration of varieties are the mainproblems in the identification of herbal medicines (Zhu et al.,2022). Due to non-standard market systems and marketsupervision and control, counterfeit and inferior Huangqiproducts often appear. The quality of Huangqi medicinal herbs isalso influenced by different geographical locations, cultivationtechniques, and climatic environments (Yang et al., 2020).Therefore, the key to the quality control of Active ingredients inHuangqi lies in the establishment of quality analysis methods.At present, the 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeiacontrols the quality of Huangqi from three aspects: morphology,microscopy, and thin-layer chromatography. It is required that themoisture content shall not exceed 10.0%, the total ash content shallnot exceed 5.0%, and the leaching content shall not be less than17.0% (Gong et al., 2018). The content of astragaloside A determinedby High-performance liquid chromatography shall not be less than0.080%, and the content of calyx Isoflavone glucoside shall not beless than 0.020%. Traditionally, High-performance liquidchromatography was used to determine the content of Huangqi.However, these methods may not be sufficient to evaluate the qualityof Huangqi medicinal herbs. With the improvement of analyticaltechnology, people have adopted other methods to determine thechemical composition of Huangqi and control its quality. Forexample, chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), externalspectroscopy (IR), and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV) provideeffective means for quantitative analysis of the Active ingredientsof Huangqi (Huang et al., 2018a).Chemical fingerprintTraditional Chinese medicine fingerprint is a comprehensiveand quantifiable identification method established based onsystematic research on the chemical composition of traditionalChinese medicine, used to evaluate the authenticity, stability,consistency, and effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine.The fingerprint of traditional Chinese medicine, as a standard forquality control, has also been included in the ChinesePharmacopoeia. Currently, the Chinese Pharmacopoeia does notinclude the fingerprint of Huangqi. Scholars (Wang et al., 2023) haveestablished a UPLC fingerprint and content determination methodfor the stem and leaf of Mongolian Huangqi, and compared andanalyzed 15 batches of Mongolian Huangqi stem and leaf samplesfrom different regions. A rapid and effective method for evaluatingthe quality of Astragalus mongholicu stem and leaf has beenestablished. DNA barcoding technology also shows broadapplication prospects in the identification of astragalus medicinalmaterials. The fingerprint determined by LC-MS combined with theITS interval domain DNA map uses the astragalus plant genomeregion as the barcode, which can quickly and accurately classify thesource plants, and can be used as the barcode mark for qualitycontrol of astragalus (Xiao et al., 2011). With the development oftechnology, quality marker (Q-marker) was proposed in 2016(Changxiao et al., 2016), and the idea of an \u201ceffect componenttarget fingerprint\u201d was discovered (Liao et al., 2018) to predict andidentify the quality of Chinese medicine Q-marker through networkpharmacology and high-performance liquid chromatographyfingerprint. Li et al. (Li et al., 2022) established a reliableanalytical method combined with network pharmacology,established fingerprint spectra of 23 batches of Huangqi,successfully isolated and quantified 8 compounds, and isexpected to become a new approach for quality control ofHuangqi (Huang et al., 2018a). At present, the HPLC-ELSDmethod is mainly used for the development of fingerprints ofsaponins and polysaccharides; The HPLC-DAD/HPLC-UVmethod can be used to establish the fingerprint of flavonoids andpolysaccharides.; The PLC-CAD method can be used to developfingerprints of flavonoids and saponins (Zhen et al., 2023).With the continuous development of technology, the qualitycontrol methods of medicinal materials are also constantlyinnovating. With the discovery of the pharmacological effects ofthe Active ingredient of Astragalus, the innovation of quality controlmethods and technologies of Astragalus is becoming more andmoreimportant. These methods and technologies are convenient forpeople to understand Chinese medicinal materials truly, quickly,and accurately, and provide a reference and basis for the qualitycontrol of the Active ingredient of Huangqi.Conclusion and future perspectivesThis review discusses the recent advances in botany,phytochemistry, traditional uses, pharmacology, toxicology, andFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org17Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1242318quality control of Astragalus. Presently, several pharmacologicalstudies have been conducted on Astragalus isoflavones, includingFMN and CAL. Therefore, this review mainly focused on thepharmacological effects of isoflavones. Pharmacological studieshave shown that isoflavones possess many pharmacologicalactivities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic,cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and antioxidant effects. Theyare also used in many other applications aspects to their diverseactivities. However, despite extensive pharmacological research onAstragalus isoflavones, some problems require further discussion.First, Astragalus has a large demand as a medicine as well food;therefore, its clinical application should be extensively investigatedto avoid excessive dosage and incompatibility. Meanwhile, herbssuch as Huangqi are highly popular in both China and abroad. Tea,soup, and congee have become important media for healthcare, withthe research and production of healthcare products increasing.Additionally, it has been established that Huangqi has a widerange of applications in herbal healthcare, particularly inimmunomodulation and regulation of blood glucose. Accordingto the clinical pharmacological effects of Huangqi, the use ofHuangqi in combination with other herbal medicines inhealthcare products should not be limited to the above functionsbut can also be studied in the areas of auxiliary improvement ofmemory, sleep, growth, and development, promotion of digestion,and auxiliary protection against gastric mucosa damage.Second, more than 200 compounds have been isolated fromAstragalus species; although flavonoids and saponins have beencomprehensively studied, the study of polysaccharide componentsof Astragalus remains limited. Some studies show that highlyvaluable the field of pharmacology is; in fact, pharmacologicalresearch and clinical applications are inseparable; therefore,combining pharmacological and clinical studies makes theapplication of Huangqi possible in many fields.Third, in terms of pharmacological effects, recent studies on theactive ingredients of Astragalus have mainly focused on FMN and CA,and studies on other active compounds and their effects are limited. Inaddition, most of these studies have focused on the anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects of FMN and CAL; however, the mechanism andtarget of action of the main pharmacological effects, such as anti-tumorand anti-inflammatory effects, are not fully understood. The number ofsamples was small, the type was single, and the pathologicalcharacteristics of different clinical patients were considered andstudied. Future pharmacological research should focus on exploringactive ingredients and their mechanisms of interaction with specifictarget ingredients, which can lay the foundation for expanding clinicalapplications in the future while also providing modern pharmacologicalinterpretations of traditional applications.Fourth, embryotoxicity and maternal toxicity have been observedabove 1.0 mL/kg Astragalus methoside administration. However, thedose\u2013effect relationship between the safety and toxicity of isoflavones, aphytoestrogen ofAstragalus, has not been studied. Thus, the mechanismof action and toxicological properties of Astragalus require furtherinvestigation. Astragalus may be contaminated by pesticides andheavy metals during cultivation, leading to increased safety problemsand reduced value; therefore, there is a need to control the use ofpesticides and conduct soil quality tests.In conclusion, traditional Chinese medicine, Huangqi, has a widerange of medicinal properties. In this review, we discuss the researchprogress on the botanical features, phytochemistry, traditionalapplications, pharmacology, toxicology, and quality control ofAstragalus. This information can lay a theoretical foundation for thefuture development and new clinical applications of Huangqi.Author contributionsPW wrote this paper; ZW checked the chemical structure andformula, and reviewed and edited the manuscript; ZZ, HC, and LKsearched for literature, downloaded it, and classified it; WM andWRconceived and designed this review.
