Cichoriumintybus, commonly known as chicory, is well known as a coffee substitute but is also widely used medicinally to treat variousailments ranging from wounds to diabetes. Although this plant has a rich history of use in folklore, many of its constituents havenot been explored for their pharmacological potential. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currently limited. This review focuseson the economic and culturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditional uses, scientific validation, and phytochemicalcomposition are discussed in detail.1. IntroductionThe genus Cichorium (Asteraceae) consists of six species withmajor distribution areas in Europe and Asia [1]. In severalAsteraceae, inulin, a \ud835\udefd-2,1 linked fructose polymer with aterminal glucose residue, functions as a reserve carbohydratein stems, tubers, and taproots [2]. Cichorium intybus L., com-monly known as chicory, is an erect fairly woody perennialherb, around 1m in height with a fleshy taproot of up to75 cm in length and large basal leaves [1, 3]. Historically,chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as a medicinalplant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop and was occasion-ally used for animal forage. In the 1970s, it was discoveredthat the root of C. intybus contained up to 40% inulin, whichhas a negligible impact on blood sugar and thus is suitable fordiabetics [4]. To date, C. intybus is grown for the productionof inulin on an industrial scale [2]. The name of the plantis derived from Greek and Latin. Cichorium means field andintybus is partly derived from the Greek \u201cto cut\u201d, because ofthe leaves, and partly from the Latin tubus to indicate thehollow stem [5].Chicory is a hardy plant and can endure extreme tem-peratures during both vegetative and reproductive growthstages [1]. When broken, all plant parts exudate a milky latex[3].Cichorium intybus is cultivated for numerous applicationsand can be divided into four main varieties or cultigroupsaccording to their use [6]: (1) \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201croot\u201d chicory,predominantly cultivated in northwestern Europe, India,South Africa, and Chile, produces the taproot as a coffeesubstitute or for inulin extraction; (2) \u201cBrussels\u201d or \u201cwitloof \u201dchicory is commonly cultivated around Europe as industrialchicory for etiolated buds (chicons) by forcing; (3) \u201cleaf \u201dchicory is used as fresh or cooked vegetables; and (4) \u201cforage\u201dchicory, initially derived from wild chicory commonly foundalong roadsides andwaste areas, has been used since themid-1970s to intensify herbage obtainability in perennial pasturesfor livestock.Cichorium intybus is a medicinally important plant inEurasia and in parts ofAfrica.Despite its long tradition of use,the plant is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia orin any official Pharmacopoeia of a European Union memberstate [5]. However, due to its prevalent distribution, differentparts of the plant have been used in traditional medicinesglobally [7]. Important phytochemicals are distributedthroughout the plant, but the main contents are presentin the root [1]. This review focuses on the economic and2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicineculturally important medicinal uses of C. intybus. Traditionaluses, scientific validation, and phytochemical compositionare discussed in detail.2. Traditional UsesMedicinal plants have been used for centuries and numerouscultures still rely on indigenous medicinal plants to meettheir primary health care needs. It is likely that the insightfulknowledge of plant-based remedies in traditional culturesadvanced through trial and error and that themost importantcures were carefully passed from one generation to another[8]. Historically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptiansas a medicinal plant [9] and it has had a long history oftherapeutic use both in areas where it is indigenous and inareas where it has been introduced. The various commonor local names describing this plant may be ascribed to thewidespread use by different folkloric groups.Different preparations of this plant are employed to treatvarious symptoms and ailments (Table 1). The juice is said tobe a folk remedy for cancer of the uterus and for tumors [4].In South Africa, although it is considered a widespread weed,leaves, stems, and roots are made into a tea for jaundice andchicory syrup is used as a tonic and purifying medicine forinfants [3]. In Turkey, an ointment is made from the leavesfor wound healing [10]. Decoction refers to a preparation thatis made by adding cold water to the plant material which isthen boiled and allowed to simmer for 5\u201310min after whichit is strained [8]. Chicory decoctions are traditionally madefrom individual plant parts and/or from the plant as a whole(Table 1).According to the Europeanmonograph, traditional use ofchicory roots includes the relief of symptoms related to milddigestive disorders (such as feeling of abdominal fullness,flatulence, and slow digestion) and temporary loss of appetite[11]. Prior to the wars in Afghanistan, folkloric reportsdescribed the use of aqueous root extracts as a light-sensitiveplant remedy for malaria. This indigenous knowledge hassince been confirmed and the antimalarial compounds ofC. intybus roots have been identified as the light-sensitivesesquiterpene lactones lactucin and lactucopicrin [12]. Theflowers of the chicory plant (Cichorii flos) are used as a herbaltreatment of everyday ailments such as a tonic and appetitestimulant and as a treatment of gallstones, gastroenteritis,sinus problems, cuts, and bruises [4]. In Italy, the whorls aremade into a decoction and used as a depurative [13]. Chicoryseeds are one of the main ingredients of Jigrine, a commercialproduct of India used for the treatment of various diseasesof the liver [14]. Other plant parts are also used for liverdisorders, namely, aerial parts in Bosnia andHerzegovina [15]and roots in Serbia and India [16, 17].3. Chemical ConstituentsChicoric acid has been identified as the major compoundin methanolic extracts of chicory (Table 2) [18]. Aliphaticcompounds and their derivatives comprise the main frac-tion while terpenoids comprise minor constituents of theplant. The flowers of chicory contain saccharides, methoxy-coumarin cichorine, flavonoids, essential oils [4], and antho-cyanins contributing to the blue colour of the perianth [19].Table 2 provides a summary of the compounds isolated andidentified from chicory. Octane, n-nonadecane, pentade-canone, hexadecane, and a tentatively identified compoundhave been found as principal volatile components [4]. A listof volatile compounds is given in Table 3.4. Pharmacological ActivitiesCichorium intybus presents a little investigated plant in termsof phytochemistry and pharmacology. Over 100 individualcompounds have been isolated and identified from this plant(Table 2), the majority of which are from the roots. Mostof the pharmacological studies on this plant document thetesting of aqueous and/or alcoholic extracts only. Apart fromthe pharmacologically important activities, the use of C.intybus (hairy root cultures) has also been implicated in thephytoremediation of DDT [20].4.1. Antimicrobial Activity. The antibacterial activity of theorganic acid-rich extract of fresh red chicory (C. intybusvar. sylvestre) was tested against periodontopathic bacteriaincluding Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, andPrevotella intermedia. The compounds identified from theactive extract include oxalic acid, succinic acid, quinic acid,and shikimic acid. All of the organic acids were found todecrease biofilm formation and adhesion of bacteria to thecells, with different levels of efficacy. These compounds alsoinduced biofilm disruption and detachment of dead cellsfor the cultured substratum [21]. In other reports on theantimicrobial activity of C. intybus, the crude aqueous andorganic seed extracts were found to be active against fourpathogenic microorganisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albi-cans, and root extracts had pronounced effects on Bacil-lus subtilis, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus,and E. coli [22, 23]. The leaf extract of C. intybus alsoshowed a moderate activity against multidrug resistant S.typhi [24]. Guaianolides-rich root extracts of C. intybus haveshown antifungal properties against anthropophilic fungiTrichophyton tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum [25].A sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin cichoralexin isolated fromchicory exhibited potent antifungal activity against Pseudo-monas cichorii [26].4.2. Anthelmintic Activity. Several studies have been con-ducted on grazing animals to determine the anthelminticpotential of secondary metabolites present in C. intybus.Grossly, it has been concluded that the animals grazing onchicory have a higher performance index and lower incidenceof gastrointestinal nematode infestations. In the majority ofthe experiments, the condensed tannins and sesquiterpenelactones were responsible for anthelmintic activity [27].Anthelmintic activity of chicory has also been noticed inthe case of lambs wherein the total number of abomasalhelminths was found to be lesser in the lambs grazing onEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3Table 1: Traditional medicinal uses of Cichorium intybus.Country Traditional use(s) Plant part(s) Preparation(s) ReferenceAfghanistan Malaria Root Aqueous extract [12]Bosnia andHerzegovinaDiarrhea, strengthening the prostate andother reproductive organs, pulmonarycancer, hangover, and purification ofbiliary tractAerial part, flowers, roots Not stated [92]Liver disorders, spasmolytic,cholesterol, antiseptic Aerial Decoction [15]BulgariaCholagogue stimulantfor gastric secretion,hypoglycemicRoots, aerial parts Decoction [93]IndiaLiver disorders Seeds [14]Diabetes Whole plant Not stated [17]Jaundice, liver enlargement, gout, andrheumatism Root Decoction [17]Cough relief Not statedIranEupeptic, stomachic, depurative,choleretic, laxative, hypotension, tonic,and antipyreticWhole plant Not stated [94]ItalyBlood cleansing Leaves Not stated [13]High blood pressure Leaves Decoction [95]Blood purification,arteriosclerosis, antiarthritis,antispasmodic,digestiveLeaves/roots Decoction [96]Depurative Whorls Decoction [97]Choleretic, hepatoprotectiveagainst jaundice, mildlaxative, hypoglycemicLeaves Decoction, squashed fresh leaves [93]Jordan Internal hemorrhage, sedative in typhoid Whole plant Cooking [14]Morocco Renal disease Aerial/roots Not stated [98]Kidney disorders, diabetes Whole plant Decoction [99]Pakistan Diabetes Roots Decoction [43]Poland Digestive complaints and lack of appetite Roots Tea [5]SerbiaDiarrhea Flower Infusion [100]Diuretic, digestive, laxative,anti-inflammatory, liver complaints,reducing blood sugarRoots Decoction/tea [16]Cholagogue, digestive, hypoglycemic Aerial part/root Not stated [101]South Africa Jaundice, tonic Leaves, stems, roots [3]TurkeyCancer, kidney stones Roots Decoction [7]Wound healing Leaf Ointment [10]Hemorrhoids, urinary disorders Aerial Tea [102]this plant [28].The condensed tannin and sesquiterpene-richextracts of C. intybus were evaluated for their efficacy againstthe larvae of deer lungworm, Dictyocaulus viviparous andother gastrointestinal nematode larvae using a larval mig-ration inhibition assay. A dose-dependent decrease in thelarval motility was observed in both lungworm and gastro-intestinal nematodes [29]. The sesquiterpene lactone-richextracts of C. intybus were also found to inhibit egg hatchingof Haemonchus contortus [30].4.3. Antimalarial Activity. The infusion of fresh roots of C.intybus has a history of use as a remedy for malarial feversin some parts of Afghanistan. The bitter compounds in theplant, namely, lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolidesesquiterpenes, isolated fromaqueous root extracts of chicorywere concluded to be the antimalarial components of theplant. Lactucin and lactucopicrin completely inhibited theHB3 clone of strain Honduras-1 of Plasmodium falciparum atconcentrations of 10 and 50\ud835\udf07g/mL, respectively [12, 31].4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable 2: Compounds isolated and identified from Cichoriumintybus (chicory).Compound Reference(s)Lactucin [12, 31, 103]Lactucopicrin [12, 31]8-Deoxylactucin [31, 104]Jacquilenin [103]11\ud835\udefd,13-Dihydrolactucin [103]11,13-Dihydrolactucopicrin [103, 104]Crepidiaside B [103]Cyanidin 3-O-p-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside [105]3,4\ud835\udefd-Dihydro-15-dehydrolactucopicrin [103]Magnolialide [103]Ixerisoside D [103]Loliolide [103]Cichorioside B [103, 104]Sonchuside A [103, 104]Artesin [103]Cichoriolide [103]Cichorioside [103]Sonchuside C [103]Cichopumilide [103]Putrescine [83]Spermidine [83]\ud835\udefd-Sitosterol [7, 83]Campesterol [83]Stigmasterol [83](7S, 8R)-3\udba0\udc20-Demethyl-dehydrodiconiferylalcohol-3\udba0\udc20-O-\ud835\udefd-glucopyranoside [106]Chlorogenic acid [19, 44, 106]3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid [18, 106]4,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid [106]Crepidiaside A [106]Cichoralexin [26]Malic acid [18]Caffeic acid [18, 44]3-Caffeoylquinic acid [18]5-Caffeoylquinic acid [18]4-Caffeoylquinic acid [18]cis-5-Caffeoylquinic acid [18]cis-Caftaric acid [18]trans-Caftaric acid [18]5-Caffeoylshikimic acid [18]5-p-Coumaroylquinic acid [18]Quercetin-3-O-glucuronide-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside [18]Kaempferol-3-O-glucosyl-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside [18]Dimethoxycinnamoyl shikimic acid [18]Kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside [18]Table 2: Continued.Compound Reference(s)Isorhamnetin-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-acetyl)-glucoside[18]5-O-Feruloylquinic acid [18]Dicaffeoyltartaric acid (chicoric acid) [18]Kaempferol-7-O-glucosyl-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Delphinidin-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside-5-O-glucoside[18]Cyanidin-3,5-di-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Cyanidin-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside [18]Petunidin-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Cyanidin [18, 105]Cyanidin-3-O-galactoside [18]Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside [18, 105]Cyanidin-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-acetyl)-glucoside [18]Malvidin-3-O-glucoside [18]Pelargonidin-3-O-monoglucuronide [18]4-O-Feruloylquinic acid [18]Apigenin-7-O-glucoside [18]Chrysoeriol-3-O-glucoside [18]Tricin-3-O-glucoside [18]1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid [18]1,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid [18]3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid [18]Quercetin-7-O-galactoside [18]Quercetin-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Quercetin-7-O-glucoside [18]Quercetin-7-O-glucuronide [18]Quercetin-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-acetyl)-glucoside [18]Kaempferide glucuronide [18]Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside [18]Kaempferol-7-O-rutinoside [18]Quercetin-7-O-p-coumaroylglucoside [18]Isorhamnetin-7-O-neohesperidoside [18]Kaempferol-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Kaempferol-7-O-glucuronide [18]Kaempferide-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide [18]Kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide-7-O-glucoside[18]Kaempferol-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside[18]Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside [18]Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5Table 2: Continued.Compound Reference(s)Myricetin-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-malonyl)-glucoside [18]Kaempferol-7-O-neohesperidoside [18]Kaempferol-7-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-acetyl)-glucoside [18]Kaempferol-3-O-(6\udba0\udc20\udba0\udc20-O-acetyl)-glucoside [18]Isorhamnetin-7-O-glucoside [18]Isorhamnetin-7-O-glucuronide [18]Delphinidin3,5-di-O-(6-O-malonyl-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside) [19]Delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside)-5-O-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside [19]Delphinidin 3-O-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside) [19]Delphinidin 3,5-di-O-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside [19]3-O-p-Coumaroyl quinic acid [19]Cyanidin 3-O-\ud835\udefd-(6-O-malonyl)-D-glucopyranoside [105]Quercetin 3-O-\ud835\udefd-D-glucoside [19]Oxalic acid [67]Shikimic acid [67]Quinic acid [67]Succinic acid [67]4.4. Hepatoprotective Activity. The folkloric use of C. intybusas a hepatoprotectant has been well documented. It is one ofthe herbal components of Liv-52, a traditional Indian tonicused widely for hepatoprotection. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted on cirrhotic patients, Liv-52medication reduced the serum levels of hepatic enzymes,namely, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotrans-ferase. It also reduced the Child-Pugh scores and ascitessignificantly [32]. Another polyherbal formulation, Jigrine,contains the leaves of C. intybus as one of its 14 con-stituents. Jigrine was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activ-ity against galactosamine-induced hepatopathy in rats. Thepretreatment of male Wistar-albino rats with jigrine signifi-cantly reduced the levels of aspartate transaminase, alaninetransaminase, and urea and increased the levels of blood andtissue glutathione. Histopathological examination of the liverrevealed that jigrine pretreatment prevented galactosaminetoxicity and caused a marked decrease in inflamed cells [33].The aqueous-methanolic extract of the seeds of C. inty-bus has been investigated for the hepatoprotective activityagainst acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-inducedliver damage in mice. It was found to decrease both the deathrate and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamyloxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamyl pyruvate transami-nase [34]. In analogous studies, the antihepatotoxic activityof the alcoholic extract of the seeds and aqueous extracts ofthe roots and root callus of C. intybuswas estimated.The oraladministration of these extracts in albino rats led to amarkeddecrease in the levels of hepatic enzymes. Also, histopatho-logical examination of the liver showed no fat accumulationTable 3: The volatile constituents of Cichorium intybus (adaptedfrom Judz\u02c7entiene\u02d9 and Bu\u00afdiene\u02d9 [4]).CompoundOctaneOcten-3-ol2-Pentyl furan(2E, 4E)-Heptadienal1,8-CineoleBenzene acetaldehyde\ud835\udc5b-NonanalCamphor(2E, 6Z)-Nonadienal(2E)-Nonen-1-al\ud835\udc5b-Decanal(2E, 4E)-Nonadienal\ud835\udc5b-Decanol(2E, 4Z)-Decadienal\ud835\udc5b-Tridecane(2E, 4E)-Decadienal\ud835\udefd-Elemene(E)-Caryophyllene\ud835\udefd-YlangeneGeranyl acetone(E)-\ud835\udefd-Farneseneallo-Aromadendrenedehydro-Aromadendrene\ud835\udefd-IononePentadecanetrans-\ud835\udefd-Guaiene(2E)-Undecanol acetateSesquicineole(2E)-Tridecanol\ud835\udc5b-HexadecaneTetradecanalTetradecanol2-Pentadecanone(E)-2-HexylcinnamaldehydeOctadecane\ud835\udc5b-Nonadecane(5E, 9E)-Farnesyl acetone\ud835\udc5b-Eicosane\ud835\udc5b-Octadecanol\ud835\udc5b-Heneicosaneor necrosis after the treatment [14, 35]. Similar studies haveestablished the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin, a phenoliccompound, and cichotyboside, a guaianolide sesquiterpeneglycoside reported from C. intybus [36, 37].6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineThe carbon tetrachloride and paracetamol-induced livertoxicities were also found to be counteracted by intraperi-toneal administration of crude extracts and fractions of C.intybus. The methanol- and water-soluble fractions exhibitedmarked reductions in serumglutamyl pyruvate transaminase,serum glutamyl oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phos-phatase, and total bilirubin levels. In the same study, toxicitywas induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with galac-tosamine and thioacetamide [38].The phenolic acid-rich seed extract of C. intybus wasevaluated for its efficacy against hepatic steatosis in vitro andin vivo. The in vitro model of hepatic steatosis was createdby incubation of the HepG2 cells with oleic acid leadingto intracellular accumulation of fat. The seed extract waseffective in decreasing the deposited fat from the cells incase of administration after the initial fat deposition (i.e.,nonsimultaneous administration with oleic acid). However,in case of simultaneous administration of seed extract andoleic acid, the extract could not protect the cells from steatosisexcept at very high doses.The extract also led to the increasedrelease of glycerol (an indicator of triglyceride degradation)in steatotic cells. In case of nonsimultaneous administration,the extract was found to upregulate the expression of SREBP-1c and PPAR-\ud835\udefc genes leading to restoration of normal levelsof corresponding proteins. In the in vivo model of hepaticsteatosis, namely, diabetic rats, treatment with seed extractresulted in significant decrease in fat accumulation and fibro-sis [39].The hepatoprotective activity of C. intybus has beencorrelated to its ability to inhibit the free radical mediateddamage. A fraction prepared from the ethanolic extract of theleaves was assessed for preventive action on the free radicalmediated damage to the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA(obtained from calf thymus). A dose-dependent decrease inthe DNA damage was observed in the present assay [40].4.5. Antidiabetic Activity. Chicory has reported antidiabeticactivity [17, 41]. Based on the traditional use of C. intybusin diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemicproperties of the ethanol extract of the whole plant wereinvestigated. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal admin-istration of streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Theethanol extract, at a dose of 125mg/Kg body weight, signifi-cantly attenuated the serum glucose levels in the oral glucosetolerance test. A marked decrease in the serum triglyceridesand cholesterol was also observed in the extract-treatedrats. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found tobe reduced in extract-treated diabetic rats as compared tountreated diabetic rats [17]. The antidiabetic effect of theaqueous seed extract of C. intybus has also been investigated.Early-stage and late-stage diabetes were differently inducedinmaleWistar albino rats by streptozotocin-niacinamide andstreptozotocin alone, respectively.The treatmentwith chicoryextract prevented weight loss in both early-stage and late-stage diabetic rats. Chicory-treated diabetic animals resistedexcessive increase in fasting blood sugar (assessed by glucosetolerance test). Grossly, normalization of blood parameters,namely, alanine aminotransferase, triacylglycerol, totalcholesterol, and glycosylated heamoglobin, was seen inthese animals. In early-stage diabetic rats, chicory treatmentled to the increase in insulin levels pointing toward theinsulin-sensitizing action of chicory [42].Feeding the diabetic Wistar rats with C. intybus leafpowder led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to nearnormal value. C. intybus administration also decreasedthe malondialdehyde (formed by thiobarbituric acid) levelsand increased glutathione content. Anticholinesterase activ-ity was restored to near normal, brain lipopolysaccharidedecreased, and catalase activity increased [43]. Caffeic acidand chlorogenic acid have been described as potential antidi-abetic agents by increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells.Both compounds were also able to stimulate insulin secretionfrom an insulin-secreting cell line and islets of Langerhans.Another compound, chicoric acid, is also a new potentialantidiabetic agent exhibiting both insulin-sensitizing andinsulin-secreting properties [44].4.6. Gastroprotective Activity. C. intybus has been used inTurkish folklore for its antiulcerogenic potency. The aque-ous decoction of C. intybus roots was orally administeredto Sprague-Dawley rats 15 minutes before the inductionof ulcerogenesis by ethanol. More than 95% inhibition ofulcerogenesis was observed in the test group [45].4.7. Anti-Inflammatory Activity. The inhibition of TNF-\ud835\udefcmediated cyclooxygenase (COX) induction by chicory rootextracts was investigated in the human colon carcinoma (HT29) cell line.The ethyl acetate extract inhibited the productionof prostaglandin E2(PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner.TNF-\ud835\udefc mediated induction of COX-2 expression was alsosuppressed by the chicory extract [46].4.8. Analgesic Activity. Lactucin, lactucopicrin, and 11\ud835\udefd, 13-dihydrolactucin exhibited analgesic action in mice in hotplate and tail-flick tests. In the hot plate test, all threecompounds exerted an analgesic effect, with lactucopicrinbeing the most potent compound. In the tail-flick test, theantinociceptive effects of all the tested compounds (30mg/kgdose) were comparable to that of ibuprofen (60mg/kg dose).Lactucin and lactucopicrinwere also established to have somesedative action as evident from the decreased spontaneouslocomotor activity in mice [47].4.9. Antioxidant Activity. The DPPH radical scavengingactivity of a polyphenols-rich fraction of C. intybus hasbeen investigated [48]. The anti- and prooxidant activitiesof Cichorium species were studied in chemical as well asbiological systems. In the case of chemical systems, theantioxidant activity of water-soluble compounds inC. intybusvar. silvestre was established in the coupled model of linoleicacid and \ud835\udefd-carotene. A pro-oxidant activity of some of thechemical components was recorded initially which notablydiminished with time and/or thermal treatment. Thereafter,the antioxidant activity of the raw juice and its fractionspersisted. The molecular weight ranges of the antioxidantfractions of raw juice were also identified based on dialysis[49]. Two varieties of chicory, namely, C. intybus var. silvestreand C. intybus var. foliosum, have been investigated for theirEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7antioxidant (antiradical) activities in two distinct biologicalsystems.The lipid peroxidation assay has been carried out onmicrosomemembranes of rat hepatocytes after the inductionof oxidative damage by carbon tetrachloride. The antiradicalactivity was expressed as the protective activity against lipidperoxidation and calculated as the percentage decrease inhydroperoxide degradation products. The second biologicalsystem used was the cultures of S. aureus after treatment withcumene hydroperoxide.The percentage increase of growth ofbacteria was noted after the treatment with juices of chicoryvarieties. In both systems, the juices of chicory varietiesshowed strong antiradical activities [21, 49].Red chicory (C. intybus var. silvestre) was studied forits polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity was eva-luated by using the synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitro-phenyl) hydrazyl radical and three model reactions catalyzedby pertinent enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species,namely, xanthine oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and diaphorase.Total phenolics were significantly correlated with the antiox-idant activity evaluated with both the synthetic radical andthe enzyme-catalyzed reactions.On amolar basis, red chicoryphenolics were as efficient as Trolox (reference compound) inscavenging the synthetic radical [50]. The aqueous-alcoholicextracts of the aerial parts of C. intybus also inhibitedxanthine oxidase enzyme dose dependently [51]. In anotherstudy, alongwithDPPHradical scavenging activity,C. intybusalso exhibited inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and chelationof ferrous ion [52].4.10. Tumor-Inhibitory Activity. The crude ethanolic extractof C. intybus roots caused a significant inhibition of Ehrlichtumor carcinoma in mice. A 70% increase in the life spanwas observed with a 500mg/kg/day intraperitoneal dose ofthe tested extract [53]. The aqueous-alcoholic macerate ofthe leaves of C. intybus also exerted an antiproliferative effecton amelanotic melanoma C32 cell lines [54]. Magnolialide,a 1\ud835\udefd-hydroxyeudesmanolide isolated from the roots of C.intybus, inhibited several tumor cell lines and induced thedifferentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells tomonocyte or macrophage-like cells [55].4.11. Antiallergic Activity. The aqueous extract of C. intybusinhibited themast cell-mediated immediate allergic reactionsin vitro as well as in vivo. This extract restrained the systemicanaphylactic reaction in mice in a dose-dependent manner.It also significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylacticreaction caused by anti-dinitrophenyl IgE in rats. Othermarkers of allergic reaction, namely, plasma histamine lev-els and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells,decreased significantly whereas the levels of cAMP increasedafter the treatment with C. intybus extract [56].4.12. Other Pharmacologically Important Activities. The eth-anol extract of the roots of C. intybus is reported to preventthe immunotoxic effects of ethanol in ICR mice. It was notedthat body weight gains were markedly decreased in miceadministeredwith ethanol. However, the bodyweightwas notaffected when ethanol was coadministered with the ethanolextract of C. intybus. Similarly, the weights of liver and spleenwere not affected when ethanol extract was given along withethanol. A considerable restoration in the other markers ofimmunity, namely, hemagglutination titer, plaque formingcells of spleen, secondary IgG antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (in response to subcutaneousadministration of sheep red-blood cells to paw), phagocyticactivity, number of circulating leucocytes, NK cell activity,cell proliferation, and production of interferon-\ud835\udefe, was reg-istered [57]. The immunoactive potential of an aqueous-alcoholic extract of the roots was established by a mitogenproliferation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).The extract showed an inhibitory effect on lymphocyteproliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and astimulatory effect on MLR [58].Chicoric acid has shown vasorelaxant activity againstnor-epinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aortastrips [59]. A pronounced anticholinesterase activity of thedichloromethane extract of C. intybus roots was seen inthe enzyme assay with Ellman\u2019s reagent. Two sesquiterpenelactones, namely, 8-deoxylactucin and lactucopicrin, alsoexhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of anticholinesterase[60]. The methanolic extract displays wound healing effectand \ud835\udefd-sitosterol was determined as the active compoundresponsible for the activity, possibly due to its significantanti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as hyaluro-nidase and collagenase inhibition [7].5. Toxicological StudiesAlthoughC. intybus has a long history of human use, the highlevels of secondary metabolites have shown potential toxi-cological effects. To evaluate the safety of the root extract ofC. intybus, Ames test and subchronic toxicity assessmentwereconducted. The sesquiterpene-rich extract was evaluated forpotential mutagenic properties (Ames test) using Salmonellatyphimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535 andEscherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Though cytotoxicity wasobserved at high extract doses in some strains, mutagenicitywas not noted. A 28-day (subchronic) oral toxicity study,conducted in CRL:CD (SD) IGS BR rats, concluded that therewas no extract-related mortality or any other signs of toxico-logical significance [61]. The toxicity evaluation of C. intybusextracts has also been done byVibrio fischeri bioluminescenceinhibition test (Microtox acute toxicity test). This bacterialtest measures the decrease in light emission from the marineluminescent bacteria V. fischeri when exposed to organicextracts. The tested extracts showed less than 20% inhibitionof bioluminescence and hence were concluded to be safe forhuman use [54].6. Clinical TrialsTwo clinical studies on chicory roots are reported in theliterature, both of which are pilot studies and are thereforeconsidered to be insufficient to support a well-establisheduse indication for chicory root [5]. The first study, a phase1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial, wasconducted to determine the safety and tolerability of a pro-prietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicineosteoarthritis (OA) [62]. In general, the treatment was welltolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highestdose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to anadverse event. The results of the pilot study suggested that aproprietary bioactive extract of chicory root has a potentialrole in the management of OA and merits further investiga-tion.The second pilot study was conducted to assess whetherchicory coffee consumption might confer cardiovascularbenefits; thus, a clinical intervention was performed with27 healthy volunteers, who consumed 300mL chicory coffeedaily for one week [63]. Depending on the inducer used forthe aggregation test, the dietary intervention showed vari-able effects on platelet aggregation. Whole blood and plasmaviscosity were both significantly reduced, along with serumMIF levels, after a week of chicory coffee intake. It was con-cluded that the full spectrum of the effects was unlikely to beattributed to a single phytochemical; nevertheless, the phen-olics (including caffeic acid) are expected to play a substantialrole. The study offered an encouraging starting-point todescribe the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects ofphenolic compounds found in chicory coffee.In the European Union, there is currently only oneregistered/authorized herbal medicinal product containingC. intybus as single ingredient whilst there are several com-bination products on the market [5]. The efficacy of herbalmedicine Liv-52 consisting of Mandur bhasma, Tamarixgallica, and herbal extracts of Capparis spinosa, C. intybus,Solanum nigrum, Terminalia arjuna, and Achillea millefoliumon liver cirrhosis outcomes was compared with the placebofor 6 months in 36 cirrhotic patients. The study concludedthat Liv-52 possessed a hepatoprotective effect in cirrhoticpatients. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed tothe diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immuno-modulating properties of the component herbs [32].7. Cultivation and Sustainable UseGreeks and Romans began to grow chicory as a vegetablecrop 4000 years ago [9]. Since the discovery in the 1970s thatchicory root contains up to 40% inulin (polysaccharide), newstrains have been created, with inulin content comparableto that of sugar beet [4]. It is a common vegetable in sev-eral Western European countries. It is typically grown in abiennial cycle, with a tuberised root produced during thevegetative growth phase [64]. During the first field year, thevegetative growth phase is characterized by the production ofa fleshy taproot. The second field year is the generative phasein which the flowering stem is formed and seeds are pro-duced. To produce the eatable leafy vegetable called a chicon,roots are harvested at the end of the first growing periodwhen an appropriate stage of maturity is reached [65]. Theapplication of inulin in the food industry was restricted to theproduction of coffee substitutes. It was later discovered thatinulin could act as a substitute for sugar or fat due to its lowcaloric value.Themost stable form for the commercializationof inulin is the powdered extract for its greater facility ofmanipulation, transport, storage, and consumption [66].Chicory is especially attractive as a cash crop since it canreachmore than 62 t ha\u22121 under favourable conditions. Inulincontent can reach on average 15% of root fresh weight and ayield of 8 t ha\u22121 of inulin is achievable [67].The USA importsmore than 2.3 million kilograms of chicons and 1.9 millionkilograms of roasted chicory roots for coffee according to2002 US Department of Commerce tariff and trade data[61]. Numerous studies have focused on different cultivationaspects of chicory. Chicory is considered one of the mostimportant sources of inulin since it has a high root yieldpotential and also a high root sugar content [68]. A highroot yield, a high inulin content, and especially long inulinchains are preferred [69]. Short chain inulin is used for theproduction of fructose syrup used in sweetening of colddrinks whereas long chain inulin is used as fat replacer andfoam stabilizer in food products and also in the productionof carboxymethyl inulin [2]. The effect of fertilizers on thegrowth, development, and yield of chicory has been wellstudied. In general, increase of nitrogen (N) increases thegrowth and ultimately the yield, although a high applicationof N has a negative effect on especially some of the aminoacids. Increased N application at levels of 200 kgNha\u22121 leadsto a decrease in amino acids such as threonine and valinewith a pronounced decreased effect onmethionine. A level of100 kgNha\u22121 is preferred for enhanced quality [70]. In termsof phosphorous (P), it has been established that chicory hasat least two inherent patterns of response to low or zero Pconditions. One pattern is the classical increase in the lengthof the smallest diameter roots in response to P deficientconditions. The second pattern is a significant decrease inroot tissue density under low P conditions [71]. It has alsobeen investigated as a suitable catch crop since it has theability towithdrawN, especially nitrate, from the soil, therebyreducing potential leaching. Additionally, it can withstandcompetition, has a slow juvenile development and vigorousgrowth after harvest of the main crop, is frost- and winter-hardy, has a well-developed root system, and does not trans-mit pathogens or pests to other crops [72]. Canopy closurein chicory is advantageous and critical for yield and can beachieved by a larger supply of assimilates to the shoot [73].Chicory is greatly influenced by the pH of the soil as thisaffects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. Astudy conducted byAnguissola Scotti el al. [74] on two soils ofpH, 5.7 and 7.0 indicated that the fly-ash or metal availabilityto the plant was significantly different at the different pH lev-els. At a lowpHadecrease of Zn, Cu, Cd, andNiwas observedand for neutral soils the added metals are more available toplants than those naturally occurring in soils [75]. Chicory isa cold-requiring long-day plant [72]. In a study by Amaducciand Pritoni [68], it was shown that retarding harvest timesignificantly affects the content and concentration of inulin.Rainfall has proven to be another important factor since theroots contain a higher water content, thereby affecting theconcentration of inulin in the roots. The same results havebeen obtained in a study by Baert [69] where an early sowingdate and harvesting time increased the root yield, total sugarcontent, and inulin chain length.The increase in yield with anearlier sowing date was up to 30% higher with an increase of10% with an earlier harvest date. The content of free fructoseand sucrose increased and the content of free glucose andinulin decreased with a later harvest time [75].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9Even though chicory is a cold-requiring plant, cold stor-age after harvest can cause a strong decrease in free glucose,an increase in free fructose and sucrose, and hydrolysis ofinulin [76]. This has also been observed by Ernst et al. [77]where an onset of cooler temperatures and especially coldertemperatures during storage resulted in an increase in sucroseand fructose content. It was found that sucrose increased inthe roots of chicory about threefold and fructose increasedabout tenfold within the first few weeks of cold storage afterharvest [77]. The effect of storage at reduced temperature hasalso been studied on the levels of sesquiterpene lactones. Stor-age at 2\u2218C and 10\u2218C for up to 13 days had no effect on thelevel of lactucin-like sesquiterpene lactones in the chiconsand after 7 days of storage a slight increase of lactucopicrincontent was observed [78]. Several types of discoloration, leafedge damage, and extensive growth of the internal core canoccur in the heads of chicory during postharvest storage,which considerably reduces their market value. An atmo-spheric composition of 10% O2and 10% CO2in combinationwith a storage temperature of 5\u2218C was found optimal [64].Low temperature in the field also hastens and enhances bolt-ing and flowering [79, 80]. The type and cultivar have beenidentified in numerous studies to be the determining factorduring the stages of growth [81]. Suhonen [82] found thehighest numbers of bolters in those being planted last, forwhich the mean temperatures during early growth were thehighest.During the postharvest period, the major polyaminespresent are putrescine, especially in the oldest leaves,although spermidine is present in considerable amounts,showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physi-ological age of the leaves. Free sterol content increases withpostharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves.Sitosterol is the major free sterol present, followed by stig-masterol and campesterol [83].Emergence has been reported as one negative aspect ofthe crop, which could be addressed by specific breeding pro-grammes [68]. Chicory can also be propagated and grown bymeans of micropropagation by regeneration of meristematicnodules. The leaves are cultivated in vitro and develop intoplantlets when transferred to soil [84]. Although chicory canbe regenerated in vitro from explants, both through organo-genesis and somatic embryogenesis, and from protoplasts,no transgenic plants have yet been reported that have beenproduced [85].Promising potential utility technologies of the plant haveemerged. Chicory roots pulps are an important by-productof the inulin processing industries and are usually used inanimal feed. Other applications can be found for these mat-erials since the extraction of chicory pulp yields high levelsof pectin, a polysaccharide extensively used in food as agelling agent, thickening agent, and stabilizer [86].The crudeprotein content in chicory is more valuable than in alfalfa.Furthermore the crude lipid in chicory is generally higherthan most varieties of alfalfa [9]. It also has a nutritionalquality comparable to lucerne, with a mineral content supe-rior for copper and zinc, with similar proportions of protein,lipid, minerals, and other nutrients, and palatable with gooddigestion with applicability in the poultry and livestockindustry [87, 88].8. ConclusionCichorium intybus has a long tradition of use globally. His-torically, chicory was grown by the ancient Egyptians as amedicinal plant, coffee substitute, and vegetable crop andwas occasionally used for animal forage. This multipurposeplant contains high amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, andmineral elements [9]. Inulin from chicory roots is considereda functional food ingredient as it affects physiological andbiochemical processes resulting in better health and reduc-tion of the risk of many diseases [89].To date, chicory remains an extremely versatile plant,amenable to geneticmanipulation, and there is interest shownin genetically engineered chicory to obtain higher yieldsand create new potentials [1]. The documented indigenousknowledge relating to the various medicinal uses of chicoryhas been supported by phytochemical isolation and inves-tigations into biological activity. Nonetheless, many of itsconstituents have not been explored for their pharmaco-logical potential and further research is necessary to gainbetter understanding of the phytochemicals against variousdiseases [9]. Toxicological data on C. intybus is currentlylimited; however, considering that the Asteraceae family isa known source of allergic problems, a contraindication forhypersensitivity should be included in the safety data [5].Recent studies suggest the use of C. intybus as a biomonitorfor heavy metals [90, 91]; considering that chicory entersthe food chain, this plant should be used with caution. Theapparent bioactivity ofC. intybus shown in preclinical studies(both in vitro and in vivo) is a testament to its historical usein traditional medicine.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThe South African Medical Research Council, Universityof South Africa and the HOD, School of PharmaceuticalSciences, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, arethanked for their support.References[1] H.
