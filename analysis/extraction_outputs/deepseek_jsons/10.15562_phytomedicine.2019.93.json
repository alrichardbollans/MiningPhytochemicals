INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) recog- nizes that traditional and complementary medicines (TCM) are a vital part of the global health care system.1 In Africa, it is estimated that over 80% of the population continues to rely on medicinal plant species to meet their basic health care needs.2 Justicia is the largest genus of Acanthaceae. Its species are widespread in tropical regions of the world3 and are poorly represented in temperate regions.4 Justicia this genus of Acanthaceae, its species are found in Asia, America and Africa. They are cultivated in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Many parts of those plants are used in traditional medi- cine to treat several diseases include, diabetes, cancers, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases and as well as inflammation, central nervous system as hallucinogens, somniferous agents, sedatives, depressors and treatments for epilepsy and other mental disorders. Other species are used in the treatment of headache and fever, sedative, analgesic, bronchitis, arthritis, vaginal discharges, dyspepsia, and eye disease. Biological activities of different extracts of Justicia are well documented and a considerable amount of phytochemicals was isolate from different parts of those plants. Botany description and Geographical Distribution The Acanthaceae family, order Scrophulariales, superorder Lamiflorae (sensu Dahlgren), comprises almost 250 genus with 2500 species. These plants are distributed over the tropical and sub-tropical regions3 and are poorly represented in temperate regions.4 Justicia secunda Vahl.

Jules M. Kitadi, et al. from South America, is nowadays grown in other tropical or subtropical African countries such as Democratic Republic of the Congo. Justicia is the largest genus of Acanthaceae, with approximately 600 species that are found in pantropical and trop- ical regions. The species of Justicia are described as erect or scandent perennial herbs or subshrubs. Leaves present cystoliths and are petiolate with a leaf margin that is usually entire. Infl orescences are in spikes or panicles cimas, and the species rarely has solitary, terminal, or axillary fl owers. The bracts and bracteoles are usually conspicuous and imbricate. The species of Justicia can be easily recognized by their bilabial corolla, with a posterior lip that is generally two-lobed, an anterior lip that is threelobed, two stamens, a capsule with four seeds, and a basal sterile portion.5 Ethnobotany Justicia secunda Vahl (Acanthaceae), a native tropical herbaceous plant originating from South America, is nowadays grown in other tropical or subtropical African countries such as Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the past, this plant was grown in the local sur-roundings as an ornamental until locals discovered its medicinal properties. The leaves of this plant were subsequently used to cure- various illnesses such as anemia or hypertension and are now widely used for many other medicinal applications. The phytochemical composition of various cultivar leaf extracts revealed the pres- ence of polyphenols such as flavonoids, tannins, leuco-anthocyanins and anthocyanins.6 Flavonoids were the largest class of phenolic compound found. Several species of Justicia are widely used in folk medicine (as shown in Table 1) for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases as well as inflammation. The plants are also utilized for their effects on the central nervous system as hallucino- gens, somniferous agents, sedatives, depressors, and treatments for epilepsy and other mental disorders, with eleven occurrences. Other species are popu- larly used in the treatment of headache fever, anal- gesic properties, cancer, diabetes, and HIV. Whole plant and aerial parts are used in folk medicine. Extracts made from only the leaves are the most used, followed by those extracts made from only the roots. Some species are used as mixtures. For exam- ple, traditional physicians around Kotagiri village near Ootacamund use a mixture of the powdered roots of Cassia occidentalis L., Caesalpineae, Derris brevipes var. Coriacea, Papillionaceae, and Justicia simplex D. Don, Acanthaceae, to control fertility. Administration of this mixture for a few days after menstruation prevents conception without any toxic effects. The number of pregnancies among treated women was significantly less than that of the control group. These results indicate the abor- tifacient nature of the roots of these plants.7 The species Justicia pectoralis Jacq. is used as the major component in a mixture to treat various diseases. Moreover, Justicia insularis T. Anderson is used as an infusion mixed with the leaves of Ambrosia maritime L., Compositae. METHODOLOGY A literature search was conducted to obtain infor- mation about the phytochemistry and pharmacog- nosy of Justicia species and Justicia secunda Vahl. from various electronic databases (PubMed Central, PubMed, Science Direct and Google scholar). The scientific name of this plant species was used as the keyword for the search, along with the terms phytochemistry and pharmacognosy. The chemical structures of the Justicia species naturally occurring compound were drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 software package. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phytochemical Screening and Pharmacology The phytocheistry screening of Justicia species revealed the presence of various secondary metabolites including the phenols, flavonoids,7,8 alkaloids,8,9 terpenes, tannins, glycosides,10,11 sapo- nins, coumarins, saponins, amino acids, aromatic amines, stigmasterol, and lupeol. Lignans also show antifeedant,11 antiangiogenic, antileishmanial, antifungal, hypolipidemic, cardiotonic, antide- pressant,12 analgesic, hepatoprotective activities,13 antiplatelet,14 antiasthmatic, antiviral,15 antineo- plastic,16 insecticidal, and anti-inflammatory. Different chemical structures of various compounds isolated from the Justicia genus (Acanthaceae) are given in Figure 1. Nur-Aqidah et al.84 in Malaysia repported the concentration of mineral nutrients in the selected medicinal plants, the mean concentration level of iron (Fe) varied between 0.14 and 0.21 mg/kg. Fe is important for the formation of haemoglobin and plays an essential role oxygen and electron transfer in a human body.85 In cellular respira- tion, it functions as an important component of enzymes involved in biological oxidation.86 Mn is an important element as a structural component of some enzymes as stated by.95 Mn is an essential trace element for the growth of plants and animals. Specifically, it is important in normal reproductive functions and normal functioning of the central nervous system.95 Justicia gendarussa and S. crispa www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(4): 157-171. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.93 159 Justicia secunda Vahl species ...

However, the species popularly used as antiviral agents, Justicia betonica L. and Justicia flava (Vahl) Vahl, were either not included in pharmacological studies, or were tested but did not show antiviral activity. Crude water extracts of the aerial parts of J. gendarussa proved to be strongly active against in vitro HIV type 1 reverse transcriptase. Based on these observations, this species might be further explored for its antiviral indications. Moreover, this species shows positive antimosquito tests, which were observed on the growth and development of IV-stage larvae of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. A brief exposure to concentrations of 0.05 to 0.50 mg/mL of the plant extract is required to produce 100% larvi- cidal activity. The extracts of J. pectoralis were found to be the most toxic larvicide among the species of Justicia extracts tested. Extracts of J. pectoralis have estrogenic, progestagenic, and anti-inflammatory,87 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(4): 157-171. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.93 167 Justicia secunda Vahl species ...

Lignans Justicidin B, Diphyllin, Justicidin A, Justicidinoside A, Justicidinoside C, Justicidinoside B, Diphylin apioside, and Diphyllin apioside-5-acetate show antiviral activi- ties. These compounds were isolated from J. extensa, J. betonica, and J. procumbens, and also show the same biological activities. Conversely, lignans Justicidin B, Diphyllin, Justicidin A, Patentiflorin A, Patentiflorin B, and Elenoside show antiviral activity, but were isolated from species that did not show this activity. A larger investigation of the extracts of these species is required to explore their antiviral activities.88 Cytotoxicy and Antibacterial activity In Malaysia a total of 300 endophytes were isolated from various parts of plants (Justicia spp) from the National Park, Pahang. 3.3% of extracts showed potent (IC50 < 0.01 \u03bcg/ml) cytotoxic activity against the murine leukemic P388 cell line and 1.7% against a human chronic myeloid leukemic cell line K562.Sporothrix sp. (KK29FL1) isolated from Costus speciosus showed strong cytotoxicity against colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cell lines with IC50 values of 0.05 \u03bcg/ml and 0.02 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Antibacterial activity has been demonstrated for 8% of the extracts. J. pectoralis showed high anti- bacterial activity against E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. epidermidis.89 The antimicrobial activity of biosynthe-sized AgNP were evaluated against foodborne bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae andEnt- erobacter aerogenes) and phytopathogenic fungi (Colletotrichum sp., Fusarium solani, Alternaria alternata and Macrophomina phaseolina). The elemental profile of synthesized nano-particles using J. spicigera shows higher counts at 3 keV due to silver, confirming the formationof silver nanoparti- cles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed a particle sizebetween 86 and 100 nm with spherical morphology. AgNP showed effective anti- bacterial andantifungal activity against the tested organisms principally with B. cereus, K. pneumo- niae, E. aerogenes, A. alternata and M. phaseolina. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm thepotential of AgNP from J. spicigera in the control of indicator organisms under field conditions.90 Anticancer activity An ethanol extract of Justicia neesii Ramamoorthy (Acanthaceae) exhibited anticancer activity against P388 lymphocytic leukemia in mice. A methanol extract of the whole plant of Justicia procumbens L. showed significant inhibitory activity in vivo against P-388 lymphocytic leukemia growth and in vitro cytotoxicity in the 9-KB (human nasopharyn- geal carcinoma) cell culture assay.91 Some species also showed inhibition of human cancer cell lines, mainly toward human cervical carcinoma (Justicia ciliata Jaqc.), T 47D and HeLa human cell lines (Justicia spicigera Schltdl.), and human ovarian cancer cell line (Justicia rhodoptera Baker), as well as prevention of some tumoral cell growth (Justicia patentiflora Hemsl.). The activity of popularly used whole-plant extracts of J. procumbens and J. nesii and leaf extracts of J. specigera as anticancer agents was confirmed by employing the same parts of the plant. However, the anticancer properties of Justicia adhatoda L. have not yet been confirmed pharmacologically.92 Zahidah et al. 2014,13 report them the metha- nolic leaf extracts of the Justicia gendarussa from five different locations in the Southern region of Peninsular Malaysia and two flavonoids, kaemp- ferol and naringenin, were tested for cytotoxic activity. Kaempferol and naringenin were two flavonoids detected in leaf extracts using gas chro- matography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The results indicated that highest concentrations of kaempferol and naringenin were detected in leaves extracted from Mersing with 1591.80mg/ kg and 444.35mg/kg, respectively. Positive correlationswere observed between kaempferol and naringenin concentrations in all leaf extracts analysedwith the Pearson method. The effects of kaempferol and naringenin from leaf extracts were examined on breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB-468) using MTT assay. Leaf extract from Mersing showed high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values of 23 \ud835\udf07g/mL and 40 \ud835\udf07g/mL, respec- tively, compared to other leaf extracts. Kaempferol possessed high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 andMDA-MB-231 with IC50 values of 23 \ud835\udf07g/mL and 34 \ud835\udf07g/mL, respectively. These findings suggest that the presence of kaempferol in Mersing leaf extract contributed to high cytotoxicity of both MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB-468 cancer cell lines. Antiepileptic and anxiolytic activities. The popular use of J. pectoralis in the treatment of epilepsy and anxiety has been confirmed with the ethanol extract of the leaves. The ethanol extracts of J. pectoralis, Justicia aurea Schltdl., and Justicia albobracteata Leonard were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit GABAtransaminase (GABA-T) or to bind to the GABA Abenzodiazepine receptor, two principal drug targets in epilepsy and anxiety. A significant positive correlation between GABA-T 168 Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(4): 157-171. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.93 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Justicia secunda Vahl species ... Jules M. Kitadi, et al. inhibition and the relative frequency of use for epilepsy was observed. Moreover, an even stronger correlation between GABA Abinding and the rela- tive frequency of use for shock was observed. Thus the Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 traditional knowledge of J. pectoralis, J. aurea, and J. albobracteata is associated with the plants antiepileptic and anxiolytic activities.92 Anti-sickling activity Anthocyanins from Justicia secunda were found to possess anti-sickling activity. Treated SS red blood cells recovered a normal, classical biconcave form with a radius of 3.3\u00b10.3\u03bcm, similar to that of normal erythrocytes.93 The results obtained indicate that all these three collected species from Kisangani and its surrounding, located at the North-East of the D.R. CONGO, showed an antisickling activity. The chemical screening performed on these plants showed in these three species the presence of poly- phenols of which anthocyanins. The tests carried out with anthocyanins extracts showed a significant activity of these metabolites with a normalization rate of the form of the sickle cells of 87% for Justicia gendarussa, 92% for Justicia insularis and 80% for Justicia tenella. The minimal concentrations in anthocyanins necessary to have maximal normal- ization are respectively of 7.2 \u03bcg/mL for Justicia insularis, 7.6 \u03bcg/mL for Justicia gendarussa and 7.7 \u03bcg/mL for Justicia tenella.6 The acute toxicity was performed with up and down method and the highest dose used was 2 g/kg. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using the carrageenan and formalin-induced paw edema models, and antinociceptive activity was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing reflex and tail flick test models while the antioxidant activity was evalu- ated using 2,2-diphenyl-2- picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) photometric assay. The extract was well tolerated as no signs of toxicity or death were noticed during the period of observation. The extract produced a concentration dependent increase in antioxidant activities in both DPPH and FRAP models. The extract produced its optimum activity at 400 lg/ml in both DPPH (54.07%) assay and FRAP (1.58 lM) assay. The extract produced significant (P < 0.05) dose-dependent increase in both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of the extract (0.4 g/ kg) were comparable with the reference drugs (aspi- rin and pentazocine) used in the study.94 CONCLUSION The present mini-review was undertaken with the aim of providing highlight and updated information on the medically and scientific evidence supporting the multiple uses of Justicia secunda Vahl. species in Traditional Medicine. Medicinal plant species are rich in secondary metabolites of pharmaceu- tical relevance. The advantages of their therapeutic uses in various ailments are their safety besides being economical, effective and available. Justicia species are pharmacologically and chemically much studied but limited to only some activities, although the diversity of secondary metabolites present in the plants species especially alkaloids, saponins tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, amino acids, aromatic amines, stigmasterol, lupeol, coumarin, steroids, glycosides have already been isolated from there. Justicia secunda Vahl. is a good candidate for Tropical Plants Screening Research program for the development of lead compounds against genetic and parasitic diseases such as the antisickling, anti-hemolytic and membrane stabi- lizing effects.
