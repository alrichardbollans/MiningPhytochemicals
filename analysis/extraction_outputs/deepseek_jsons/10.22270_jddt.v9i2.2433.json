Worldwide, plants have been used by traditional medicinal practitioners to treat human and veterinary ailments. Medicinal systems such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Chinese medicine employ several plant species to promote health and to combat infectious diseases and certain other disorders. Countries such as India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Pakistan and many African countries utilize plant based medicines as primary healthcare. Plants are considered as valuable sources of bioactive compounds (secondary metabolites produced by metabolic pathways such as shikimic acid pathway and malonate/acetate pathway) with therapeutic values. Drugs viz. quinine, morphine, codeine, vincristine, vinblastine, taxol, digoxin, and artemisinin are from plant origin. Besides, medicinal plants have also become a source of income generation in many parts of the world. In recent years, plants have been given much focus owing to some drawbacks such as high cost, adverse effects and emergence of resistance that are associated with the use of modern drugs.1-6 Clerodendrum is a large genus of flowering plants (herbs, shrubs and small trees) belonging to the family Lamiaceae found distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The genus was described by Linnaeus for first time. The flowers of the plants are visited by butterflies and humming bird and the larvae of some insects feeds on certain Clerodendrum species. Many species of the genus have been used in indigenous medicine in several countries. Few species have been extensively studied for phytochemicals present and pharmacological properties. Pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antimalarial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, larvicidal and antidiarrheal activities have been shown by Clerodendrum species.7-17 Clerodendrum infortunatum L. (Syn. C. viscosum Vent.) is a large tawny-villous shrub with white flowers in large, terminal panicles. The plant distributed in various countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is known by name perugilai in Tamil, Bhant in Hindi, Ibbane in Kannada and Prashith Kekuda et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(2):547-559 ISSN: 2250-1177 [548] CODEN (USA): JDDTAO Bhandira in Sanskrit. The plant is common in the outskirts of semi-evergreen forests. Flowers are often visited by butterflies that play an important role in pollination. The plant is used as medicine for various purposes either singly or in certain polyherbal formulations in various indigenous systems of medicine including Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy.18-20 In this review, we carried out an extensive literature survey to compile information available on the traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of C. infortunatum by referring standard flora, journals, and search engines such as ScienceDirect, Google scholar, and Pubmed.

INFORTUNATUM Plants produce myriad chemicals that are collectively referred as phytochemicals. Many of such metabolites are secondary metabolites and have profound effect on the health of an individual. Alkaloids, terpenes and polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids are few among the secondary metabolites produced by plants. Plant secondary metabolites are significant and play important roles such as protection of the plants from pathogens, insects and herbivores, contribute to fragrance and vibrant color which may aid in pollination. These secondary metabolites are responsible for therapeutic potential of plants as it is experimentally shown that purified phytochemicals exhibit wide range of bioactivities.63-66 Various parts of C. infortunatum are investigated for the detection of phytochemicals. Many methods such as standard phytochemical analysis, HPLC, HPTLC and GC-MS have been employed to detect and quantify phytochemicals present in various parts of C. infortunatum.67-71 Many chemical species such as limonene, phytol, catechol, hexadecanoic acid, squalene, dodecanoic acid, vitamin E, hydroxymethylfurfural, stigmasterol, cinnamic acid, guaiacol, eugenol, vanillic acid have been detected in C. infortunatum by GC-MS analysis.69 Three clerodane diterpenoids namely Clerodin, 15-methoxy-14,15-dihydroclerodin and 15- hydroxy-14,15-dihydroclerodin having insecticidal activity have been detected in C. infortunatum.72 The ethanolic extract of root was found to contain 1.4% w/w of alkaloid as estimated by spectrophotometric method.73 A tannin content of 166.6\u00b15.607mg tannic acid equivalents/g dry extract of root bark was estimated by Folin-denis assay.74 More information on the presence of various phytochemicals in different parts of the plant and the structures of some of the compounds identified is shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.

INFORTUNATUM A number of studies have revealed a wide range of pharmacological activities displayed by various parts of C. infortunatum. Biological activities (in vitro and in vivo) such as antimicrobial, anthelmintic, insecticidal, analgesic, antipyretic, insecticidal, hepatoprotective, wound healing, thrombolytic, antidiabetic, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activity have been displayed by C. infortunatum. A brief detail on the biological activities displayed by the plant is discussed below. Cytotoxic activity Many studies have been undertaken to investigate in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic/anticancer nature of different parts of C. infortunatum by various assays such as MTT assay, SRB method, brine shrimp lethality assay and inhibition of colony forming ability of cancer cell lines. Solvent extracts from leaf and bark were shown to exhibit concentration dependent cytotoxic activity against brine shrimp larvae.98 A water extract fraction from the root was evaluated for its anticervical cancer cell bioactivity. It was found that the fraction displayed pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anti- migratory activity in a dose-dependent fashion against cervical cancer cell lines. The major component in fraction was identified as a glycoprotein via SDS Page and Concanavalin-A binding studies.99 The hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water fractions of 70% methanolic leaf extract displayed significant cytotoxicity against human glioblastoma (U87) cells. The fractions were able to arrest the cells at G2/M phase as well as induce apoptosis.100 Waliullah et al.101 revealed the potential of ethanol and chloroform extracts of leaf, stem and root of to exhibit cytotoxicity against brine shrimp larvae. Ethanol extracts were most active than chloroform extracts. The cytotoxicity of various parts was in the order: root extract > leaf extract > stem extract. The study carried out by Chacko et al.84 revealed dose dependent antiproliferative activity of root extract against murine tumor cells (Dalton\u2019s lymphoma ascites cells) by the induction of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis however the extract was not shown to be toxic to mouse spleenocytes. Helen et al.74 showed a dose dependent cytotoxicity of tannins isolated from roots against HCT 15 cancer cell lines by MTT assay. The study by Chandra and Sanjib102 revealed the antiproliferative potential of solvent extracts of leaves against Dalton\u2019s lymphoma cells by MTT assay. Haris et al.75 studied the effect of chloroform and hexane extract of roots on inhibition of colony forming ability of A549 cells (lung cancer cell line) and effect against nuclear morphology. Extract treatment resulted in inhibition of colony forming abilities of cancer cells and also exhibited a direct influence on the nuclear morphology of cells. Further, it was also observed that the extract treatment had a direct effect on the motility of A549 cells (i.e. motility of cells was inhibited) as indicated by the result of scratch motility or wound healing assay. Waliullah et al.103 carried out cytotoxicity determination of leaf, root and stem extracts by brine shrimp lethality bioassay. All extracts exhibited cytotoxic potential. Ethanol extract of root and ethyl acetate extract of stem displayed marked cytotoxicity in terms of causing mortality of brine shrimp larvae. Mohandas and Narayanan104 observed dose dependent cytotoxic activity of ethanol extract of leaves against L929 cell line by MTT assay. A study on anticancer activity of methanolic extract of leaves against Ehrlich\u2019s ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing Swiss albino mice was carried out by Sannigrahi et al.67 Treatment with extract resulted in a significant decrease in the tumor cell volume and increase in the life span of animals. Besides, all the hematological parameters, malonaldehyde content and activity of antioxidant enzyme were restored. Haris et al.89 revealed dose dependent cytotoxic potential of extracts of leaves and roots against cell lines viz. T47D (breast), PC-3 (prostate), A549 (lung) and HCT-116 (colon) cancer cell lines by SRB method. Table 3 shows more details on the cytotoxic potential of C. infortunatum as evaluated by brine shrimp lethality bioassay.

In the study of Rajakaruna et al.109, the extract of C. infortunatum was shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterobacter faecalis however no activity was observed against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Prusty et al.88 evaluated antibacterial activity of various solvent extracts of C. infortunatum leaves against a panel of test bacteria by disc diffusion and MIC determination method. Extracts were effective against test bacteria with marked activity against gram positive bacteria when compared to gram negative bacteria. Benzene extract was more inhibitory to bacteria followed by ethanol and aqueous extracts. Modi et al.110 evaluated antibacterial activity of ethanolic extract of leaves against gram positive and gram negative bacteria by disc diffusion method. The extract exhibited highest inhibitory activity against E. coli. A mixture of extracts of C. infortunatum, Vitex negundo and Argyreia nervosa was shown to exhibit marked antibacterial activity when compared to leaf extract of C. infortunatum alone. Choudhury et al.92 revealed the antibacterial potential of a compound called viscosene isolated from aerial parts against bacteria viz. Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli and Proteus vulgaris. Table 4 shows more information on the antibacterial activity of various parts of C. infortunatum.

Extracts were shown to display significant reduction in hyperthermia with marked activity being exhibited by benzene extract followed by ethanol and aqueous extracts. Anthelmintic activity Benzene, ethanol and aqueous extracts of leaves were shown to exhibit dose dependent anthelmintic activity in terms of paralysis and death of earthworms. Benzene and ethanol extracts were effective while aqueous extract displayed weaker anthelmintic potential.88 Various concentrations of aqueous and ethanol extracts of leaves were screened for anthelmintic activity by using earthworm Pheretima posthuma. Ethanol extract displayed marked anthelmintic potential as it caused paralysis and death of worms in relatively shorter time when compared to time taken by aqueous extract and standard anthelmintic piperazine citrate.119 Methanolic extract of leaves was shown to display dose dependent paralysis and death of P. posthuma.120. Methanolic and aqueous extracts from roots displayed anthelmintic activity against P. posthuma in terms of causing paralysis and death of worms. Among extracts, methanolic extract exhibited marked activity when compared to aqueous extract.106 Shamsul et al.105 showed dose dependent anthelmintic activity of methanol and aqueous extract of leaves using P. posthuma. Methanol extract displayed marked anthelmintic potential than aqueous extract. Haris et al.117 revealed dose dependent anthelmintic activity of leaf extracts in terms of paralysis and death of P. posthuma. Among solvent extracts ethanol extract displayed marked anthelmintic effect as ethanol extract took less time to cause paralysis and death of worms. Das et al.121 have also shown the potential of ethanolic and aqueous extract of roots and leaves to exhibit dose dependent anthelmintic activity. Activity observed was marked against Ascardia galli (recovered from fowls) when compared to P. posthuma. Recently, Nandi et al.122 revealed anthelmintic potential of ethanolic extract of leaves against fowl tapeworm Raillietina tetragona in terms of paralysis and death of worms. Electron microscopic observations showed disruptions in the tegument and parenchymal layer, accompanied by deformities in cell organelles indicating anthelmintic efficacy of leaf extract. Thrombolytic and membrane stabilizing activity Ali et al.123 revealed thrombolytic activity of methanol extract and solvent fractions viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and aqueous fractions of leaves by clot lysis assay. Carbon tetrachloride fraction and chloroform fraction displayed highest and least percentage of clot lysis. Joly et al.87 showed thrombolytic and membrane stabilizing activity of various solvent fractions of root by clot lysis assay and heat and hypotonic solution induced Prashith Kekuda et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(2):547-559 ISSN: 2250-1177 [553] CODEN (USA): JDDTAO hemolysis assay respectively. Fractions were shown to exhibit inhibitory activity against hemolysis induced by heat and hypertonic solution. Ethyl acetate extract was shown to exhibit marked thrombolytic and membrane stabilizing activity. The study of Rippon et al.95 also showed membrane stabilizing activity of leaf extract in terms of dose dependent inhibition of hemolysis of human erythrocytes. The extract also caused dose dependent clot lysis activity indicating thrombolytic activity. Nootropic (memory enhancing) activity Two concentrations viz. 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg of methanolic extract obtained from leaves were evaluated for nootropic activity in mice using interoceptive behavioral models (rectangular maze and Y maze). At higher dose, the extract revealed a promising nootropic effect which closely approximated the result for the standard drug Brahmi.124 Antioxidant activity The study carried out by Sannigrahi et al.82 revealed the dose dependent scavenging potential of methanolic extract of leaves against DPPH, nitric oxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals with an IC50 value of 86.7, 76.1, 90.1 and 65.8\u00b5g/ml respectively. The extract also showed ferric reducing activity. Prakash et al.80 observed scavenging of DPPH radicals by ethanol extract of whole plant with an IC50 value of 50.905\u00b5g/ml. The study by Kumar et al.125 revealed dose dependent scavenging of DPPH radicals by methanol extract of roots with an IC50 value of 34.46\u00b5g/ml. The extract also exhibited reducing potential. Sumi et al.78 revealed marked dose dependent scavenging of DPPH radicals by root extract with an IC50 value of 32.5\u00b5g/ml. More information of antioxidant activity of C. infortunatum is presented in Table 6.

Ghate et al.100 Insecticidal activity Several studies have been undertaken to investigate insecticidal activity of various parts of C. infortunatum. The study carried out by Abbaszadeh et al.72 revealed the potential of three clerodane diterpenoids viz. clerodin, 15- methoxy-14,15-dihydroclerodin and 15-hydroxy-14,15- dihydroclerodin isolated from C. infortunatum to exhibit insecticidal activity against Helicoverpa armigera with GI50 values of 13, 21 and 11 ppm respectively. In a study, the leaf powder mixed with cow dung at various concentrations (5, 10 and 20% w/w) was fed to third instar grubs of rhinoceros beetle Oryctes rhinoceros. A dose dependent mortality of grubs was observed. Further, the plant has adverse effects on the reproduction capability of male insect.130 Insecticidal activity of leaf powder was evaluated against fourth instar larvae of banana pseudostem borer Odoiporus longicollis. A dose dependent mortality of larvae by plant was observed with an LD50 value of 3.987%.131 Dinesh et al.132 revealed the insecticidal activity (by adulticidal and larvicidal assays) of whole plant, root, bark and leaf against the sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes. Hexane extract of root exhibited stronger insecticidal activity against adult insect (77%) while larvae were not affected. A fraction obtained from the leaf extract was shown to be effective against P. argentipes (63% effective). The study of Mondal et al.133 revealed the larvicidal potential of leaf extract against filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The leaf extract was effective in causing larval mortality dose dependently with LC50 value of 0.075%. Roy et al.134 showed the insecticidal effect of aqueous extract of C. infortunatum against 3rd instar larvae of Hyposidra talaca an emerging major pest of tea by leaf dip method. Table 7 presents more information on the insecticidal efficacy of C. infortunatum.

Administration of extract caused a reduction in the elevated blood glucose level. An increase in the body weight was also observed. Study of Devi and Kumar86 revealed the inhibitory effect of ethanol and chloroform extract of leaves against the activity of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. Kalita and Chakraborty141 revealed antidiabetic activity of methanolic extract of leaves in rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocine. A significant increase in the body weight and reduction in blood glucose level was observed in animals administered with the extract indicating the potential to act against diabetes. Further, administration of extract to diabetic rats also exhibited a dose dependent protective effect against testicular damage caused by diabetes induced by streptozotocine. A significant improvement in sperm parameters such as sperm motility, sperm viability and sperm count was observed. Panigrahi et al.142 have also revealed antidiabetic activity of leaf extract against hyperglycemia in rats induced by streptozotocin. A significant decrease in fasting blood glucose level in diabetic rats was observed at the extract dose of 400mg/kg body weight. The study of Das et al.143 revealed the antihyperglycemic potential of leaf extract against streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. Extract administration showed a significant and dose dependent reduction in blood glucose level when compared to control group animals. Further, a decrease in lipid peroxidation and a recovery of GSH level and catalase activity was observed in extract treated animals. Wound healing activity The study of Kuluvar et al.144 revealed the wound healing potential of roots by excision, incision and dead space wound models in rats. Topical application of ointment cream bases of root extracts showed significant wound healing activity in terms of increased area of epithelialization, followed by an increase in wound contraction, skin breaking strength and tissue granulation dry weight. Hepatoprotective activity Sannigrahi et al.145 evaluated hepatoprotective potential of methanolic extract of leaves against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Extract administration resulted in reduction in MDA concentration and an increase in liver antioxidative enzyme activity. In addition, histopathology of liver tissue showed reduction of fatty degeneration and liver necrosis indicating hepatoprotective activity. Singh et al.146 revealed ameliorative efficacy of methanolic extract of leaves against arsenic induced hepatotoxicity in albino rats. Administration of extract to animals revealed hepatoprotective activity in terms of increase in liver weight and SOD level and a decrease in the level of MDA, ALT and AST. Analgesic activity Khatry et al.147 observed a dose dependent antinociceptive activity of methanol extract of whole plant in acetic acid induced writhing in swiss albino mice. In a study, saponin isolated from the leaves was screened for analgesic activity by acetic acid induced writing and hot plate method. Saponin was found to exhibit marked analgesic effect in terms of inhibition of writhing induced by acetic acid and production of analgesia (in terms of increase in retention time) in mice in hot plate method.8 Das et al.148 revealed the analgesic potential of leaves by tail flick method. Rahman et al.126 showed antinociceptive activity of methanolic extract of leaves by acetic acid induced writhing in mice. A significant activity was observed when compared to standard drug Diclofenac. The root extract was shown to produce 38.59% and 59.07% writhing inhibition at the doses of 250mg/kg and 500 mg/kg respectively.[78] Ethanolic extract of root was shown to exhibit an appreciable analgesic activity in mice as evaluated by methods viz. hot plate, tail immersion, acetic acid induced writhing and formalin test.73 The study of Chandrashekar and Rao149 revealed analgesic potential of ethanol extract of leaves by acetic acid induced writhing in swiss albino mice, however, the extract failed to produce analgesia by tail immersion method. Antivenom activity Lobo et al.150 evaluated antisnake venom activity of alcoholic root extract in Naja naja venom by in vitro (using human blood) and in vivo (in mice) methods. In vitro studies revealed only interaction with but do not stabilize membrane protein. However, in in vivo study, the extract displayed significant activity which was attributed to the possible interference of extract with the acetyl choline binding sites. Antiinflammatory activity Khatry et al.147 showed concentration dependent anti- inflammatory potential of whole plant extract by carrageenan induced paw edema method in rats. Extract administration showed statistically significant inhibition of paw volume. The study carried out by Prasanth et al.73 revealed anti-inflammatory activity of root extract by carrageenan induced paw edema in mice. At dose 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg, the ethanol extract produced significant reduction in the edema when compared to standard drug. In another study, Chandrashekar and Rao151 showed significant and dose dependent anti-inflammatory activity of ethanolic extract of leaves by carrageenan induced paw oedema model in Wistar rats. Helen et al.152 revealed anti-inflammatory activity by carrageenan induced paw oedema of various extracts of root bark. Aqueous acetone extract was shown to exhibit marked anti-inflammatory activity. It was observed that the phenolic content of extract correlates with the anti- inflammatory activities. Rippon et al.95 evaluated in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of leaf extract in terms of inhibitory activity against protein denaturation in egg Prashith Kekuda et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(2):547-559 ISSN: 2250-1177 [555] CODEN (USA): JDDTAO albumin assay. The extract was shown to cause inhibition of protein denaturation with an IC50 value of 127.7\u00b10.5\u03bcg/ml. Anticonvulsant activity Pal et al.8 investigated anticonvulsant activity of saponin isolated from the leaves by leptazol-induced seizure method in mice. Saponin was shown to reduce the duration of seizures and also provided protection against leptazol- induced convulsions in a dose dependent manner. The study carried out by Das et al.85 also revealed significant anticonvulsant activity of leaf extract by methods viz. pentylenetetrazole- and strychnine- induced convulsion in mice. The extract significantly delayed the onset and antagonized seizures. Further, the extract significantly increased pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time in a dose dependent manner. Diuretic activity Khatry et al.147 evaluated diuretic activity of whole plant extracts by recording urinary output from 1 to 4 hours of extract administration (at an interval of 1 hour). The results showed that the extract lacks diuretic activity as the extract exhibited a score of <0.72. Further, it was observed that the extract lacks natriuretic or saliuretic properties and the extract had no inhibitory property on carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Effect on germination of seeds A study on the effect of leaf extract on the germination and growth of root and shoot of some vegetable crops was carried out by Islam et al.153 It was observed that the chloroform extract showed significant effect and enhanced the germination, growth of shoot length and root length of yard long bean and swamp cabbage while it reduced and delayed the germination, growth of shoot length and root length of lady\u2019s finger seeds compared with control. Datta and Chakrabarti154 revealed allelopathic effect of decaying plant-parts of C. infortunatum against weed seeds as evaluated by inhibition of germination of seeds and root and hypocotyl growth of weeds. CONCLUSIONS An extensive literature survey on various aspects of C. infortunatum revealed high medicinal value in various geographical areas and various pharmacological properties displayed by the plant as revealed by in vitro and in vivo studies. The studies have given justification to the traditional uses of the plants by various indigenous communities. A number of phytochemicals have been identified which can be attributed to the observed biological activities of the plant. Overall, it appears that the plant C. infortunatum is suitable for the development of therapeutic agents against various ailments or disorders.
