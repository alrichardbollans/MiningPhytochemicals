Hogan\u2217, School of Physics University College Dublin Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland Abstract A brief description is given of the life and influence on relativity the- ory of Professor J. L. Synge accompanied by some technical examples to illustrate his style of work. 1 Introduction When I was a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Synge in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies he was fifty\u2013one years older than me and he remained research active for another twenty years. John Lighton Synge FRS was born in Dublin on 23rd. March, 1897 and died in Dublin on 30th. March, 1995. As well as his emphasis on, and mastery of, the geometry of space\u2013time he had a unique delivery, both verbal and written, which I will try to convey in the course of this short article. But first the basic facts of his academic life are as follows: He was educated in St. Andrew\u2019s College, Dublin and entered Trinity College, University of Dublin in 1915. He graduated B.A. (1919), M.A. (1922) and Sc.D. (1926). He was Assistant Professor of Mathematics in the University of Toronto (1920\u201325), subsequently returning to Trinity College Dublin as Professor of Natural Philosophy (1925\u201330) and then left for the University of Toronto again to take up the position of Professor of Applied Mathemat- ics (1930\u201343). From there he went to Ohio State University as chairman of the Mathematics Department (1943\u201346) followed by Head, Mathematics De- partment at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh (1946\u201348) before \u2217Email: peter.hogan@ucd.ie 1 Figure 1: J. L. Synge 1897-1995 returning to Dublin to establish his school of relativity in the Dublin Insti- tute for Advanced Studies. He officially retired when he was seventy\u2013five years old. Synge was prolific, publishing 250 papers and 11 books. In 1986 he wrote, but did not publish, some informal autobiographical notes [1], which he described as being for his family and descendants and to aid obituary writers, and which are deposited in the library of the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Early in his career he published his first important paper: \u201cOn the Geometry of Dynamics\u201d, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A226 (1926), 31-106. Of this work he said [1]; \u201cI sent a copy to T. Levi-Civita`, and in return he sent me a copy of a paper by him, just appearing. Our papers had in common the equation of geodesic deviation, now familiar to relativists, but he had done it using an indefinite line element, appropriate to relativity, whereas my line element was positive definite.\u201d 2 A Scheme of Approximation Synge placed great emphasis on working things out for oneself, writing that [2] \u201cthe lust for calculation must be tempered by periods of inaction, in which the mechanism is completely unscrewed and then put together again. It is the decarbonisation of the mind.\u201d As an illustration of this activity I give a weak field approximation scheme published in 1970 by Synge [3] which has the advantage that it can be described without reference to an 2 example. This is a topic which, by 1970, had become a standard entry in textbooks on general relativity and one might be forgiven for thinking that by then the last word had been said on it. We first need some basic objects and notation. In Minkowskian space- time Synge liked to use imaginary time (which some people find maddening!) and to write the position 4\u2013vector in rectangular Cartesians and time as xa = (x, y, z, it) with a = 1, 2, 3, 4 and i = \u221a\u22121, with the index in the covariant or lower position. The Minkowskian metric tensor in these coordinates has components \u03b4ab (the Kronecker delta). If the metric tensor of a space\u2013time has components of the form gab = \u03b4ab + \u03b3ab , then he defined the \u201ctruncated Einstein tensor\u201d G\u02c6ab via Gab = Lab + G\u02c6 ab , where Gab is the Einstein tensor calculated with the metric gab and Lab = 1 2 (\u03b3ab,cc + \u03b3cc,ab \u2212 \u03b3ac,cb \u2212 \u03b3bc,ca)\u2212 1 2 \u03b4ab(\u03b3cc,dd \u2212 \u03b3cd,cd) . The energy\u2013momentum\u2013stress tensor of matter giving rise to a gravitational field has components T ab. With these preliminaries Synge\u2019s strategy is as follows: (1) Given T ab, generate a sequence of metrics gab M = \u03b4ab + \u03b3ab M (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N); (2) Approximations are introduced by expressing the components T ab in terms of a small parameter; (3) Integrability conditions, equivalent to the equations of motion, are im- posed to terminate the sequence at a term which satisfies Einstein\u2019s field equations with a predicted order of approximation in terms of the small parameter. The sequence is constructed as follows: with \u03b3\u2217ab M = \u03b3ab M \u2212 1 2 \u03b4ab \u03b3cc M (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) , 3 and H M ab = T ab + (8\u03c0)\u22121G\u02c6 M ab (\u03b3 M ) (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) , define the sequence {\u03b3ab M } by \u03b3ab 0 = 0 and \u03b3\u2217ab M = 16\u03c0KabrsH rs M\u22121 (M = 1, 2, 3, . . . N) . Here Kabrs is an operator defined by Kabrs = \u2212\u03b4ar \u03b4bs J + J(\u03b4ar Dbs + \u03b4bsDar \u2212 \u03b4abDrs)J , with Da = \u2202/\u2202xa, Dab = \u2202 2/\u2202xa\u2202xb. The operator J is the inverse d\u2019Alembertian: Jf(~x, t) = \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u222b f(~x\u2032, t\u2212 |~x\u2212 ~x\u2032|) |~x\u2212 ~x\u2032| d3x \u2032 . Synge proved that the integrals involved in the implementation of the op- erator K converge if the physical system is stationary (T ab,4 = 0) for some period in the past. He called this property J\u2013convergence. Approximations are introduced as follows: all {\u03b3ab M } defined above satisfy the coordinate conditions \u03b3\u2217ab,b M = 0 (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) . Introduce approximations by assuming T ab = O(k) for some dimensionless parameter k then \u03b3ab M \u2212 \u03b3ab M\u22121 = O(kM ) (M = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N) , from the definition of \u03b3ab, and G\u02c6 M ab \u2212 G\u02c6 M\u22121 ab = O(kM+1) , from the quadratic nature of G\u02c6ab. To obtain a solution of Einstein\u2019s field equations in the Nth. approximation, terminate the sequence {\u03b3ab M } at the 4 Nth. term by imposing the Integrability Conditions/Equations of Motion in the Nth. approximation: H N\u22121 ab ,b \u2261 T ab,b + (8\u03c0)\u22121 G\u02c6 N\u22121 ab ,b = 0 . Now \u03b3\u2217ab N = \u221216\u03c0 J H N\u22121 ab , and G N ab + 8\u03c0 T ab = O(kN+1) , showing that Einstein\u2019s field equations are approximately satisfied in this sense. This scheme was subsequently utilised for the study of equations of motion in general relativity [4], [5], [6] and [7]. In an amusing spin-off Synge [8] constructed the following divergence\u2013 free pseudo\u2013tensor: first write the vanishing covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum\u2013stress tensor in the equivalent forms T ab|b = 0 \u21d4 T ab,b +Ka = 0 . Here Ka = \u0393 a cb T cb + \u0393bcb T ac is not a tensor (so the position of the index a is not significant; \u0393abc are the components of the Riemannian connection calculated with the metric tensor gab). Then define the pseudo\u2013vector Qa = JKa \u21d2 \u0003Qa = Ka , (with J the operator introduced above and\u0003 the Minkowskian d\u2019Alembertian operator) and define the pseudo\u2013tensor \u03d5ab = Qa,b +Qb,a \u2212 \u03b4abQc,c . It thus follows that \u03d5ab,b = \u0003Qa +Qb,ab \u2212Qc,ca = \u0003Qa = Ka = \u2212T ab,b . Hence \u03c4ab = T ab + \u03d5ab = \u03c4 ba , is a pseudo\u2013tensor with vanishing divergence (\u03c4ab,b = 0). However Synge offered, in his characteristic style, these words of warning: \u201cI refrain from attaching the words momentum and energy to this pseudo\u2013tensor or to in- tegrals formed from it, because I believe that we are barking up the wrong tree if we attach such important physical terms to mathematical constructs which lack the essential invariance property fundamental in general relativ- ity.\u201d 5 3 Lorentz Transformations Synge gave a succinct description of his early education when he wrote [1]: \u201cAlthough there are great gaps in my scientific equipment - like Hadamard, I could never get my teeth into group theory - I think I have ranged more widely than most. I might easily have stuck to classical subjects in which I was well trained as an undergraduate (dynamics, hydrodynamics, elas- ticity), but I wanted to take part in the new subjects, and in due course I mastered relativity but not quantum theory.\u201d True to this background, when considering Lorentz transformations, Synge thought of the analogy with \u201cthe kinematics of a rigid body with a fixed point\u201d (in [?]) and thus the construction of a general rotation in three dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the Euler angles. For Lorentz transformations the analogy re- quires six transformations of an orthonormal tetrad to another orthonormal tetrad, involving three pseudo angles (the arguments of hyperbolic func- tions) and three Euclidean angles. While this perspective is interesting the resulting formalism is not well suited to discussing the detailed effect of Lorentz transformations on the null cone. In the second edition of his text on special relativity Synge thanked I. Robinson and A. Taub \u201cfor pointing out an error in Chapter IV of this book as first published (1955): singular Lorentz transformations were overlooked.\u201d Taub was using spinors but Robinson had encountered the singular case in a novel way [9, 10, 11]: Robinson was interested in the Schwarzschild solution in the limit m \u2192 +\u221e. Starting with the Eddington\u2013Finkelstein form ds2 = \u2212 r 2 (dx2 + dy2){ 1 + 1 4 (x2 + y2) }2 + 2 du dr + ( 1\u2212 2m r ) du2 and, using a clever coordinate transformation, Robinson wrote this in the form ds2 = \u2212 r 2 cosh2 \u03bb\u03be (d\u03be2 + d\u03b72) + 2 du dr + ( \u03bb2 \u2212 2 r ) du2 , \u03bb = m\u22121/3 Taking the limit \u03bb\u2192 0 (\u21d4 m\u2192 +\u221e) this becomes ds2 = \u2212r2(d\u03be2 + d\u03b72) + 2 du dr \u2212 2 r du2 This is another (different from Schwarzschild) Robinson\u2013Trautman [12] type D vacuum space\u2013time. The metric tensor has one term singular at r = 0. 6 This line element can be written in the form ds2 = \u2212T 4/3(dX2 + dY 2)\u2212 T\u22122/3dZ2 + dT 2 which is a Kasner [13] solution of Einstein\u2019s vacuum field equations. If we remove the term singular at r = 0 above we have a line element ds2 = \u2212r2(d\u03be2 + d\u03b72) + 2 du dr This is flat space\u2013time and r = 0 is a null geodesic. Hence \u03be \u2192 \u03be + a , \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7 + b , u\u2192 u , r\u2192 r where a, b are real constants, constitutes a Lorentz transformation leaving only the null direction r = 0 invariant. This is a singular Lorentz trans- formation (or null rotation) and the example moreover shows that such transformations exist and constitute a two\u2013parameter Abelian subgroup of the Lorentz group. 4 Synge on an Observation of E. T. Whittaker I mentioned at the outset that Professor Synge remained research active well into old age. To demonstrate this I want to give an example of some work carried out when he was eighty\u2013eight years old. For several years, starting in the early 1980\u2019s, he and I found it convenient to correspond via letter. This allowed easy exchange of the results of calculations before the age of email. He typed his letters, including equations, on an ancient machine which he had used for years. The example I want to give involves an observation due to E. T. Whittaker and to do it justice I must first give a fairly extensive introduction. Whittaker (in [14], [15]) was concerned with the Lie\u00b4nard\u2013Wiechert elec- tromagnetic field of a moving charge e so we will need some notation which we can briefly summarise as follows: 1) Line element: ds2 = \u03b7ijdX i dXj = \u2212dX2 \u2212 dY 2 \u2212 dZ2 + dT 2 . 2) World line of charge: Xi = wi(u) ; vi(u) = dwi/du with vi vi = +1 (\u21d2 vi = 4\u2013velocity, u = arc length or proper time); ai = dvi/du = 4\u2013 acceleration \u21d2 ai vi = 0) 3) Retarded distance of Xi from Xi = wi(u): r = \u03b7ij(X i \u2212 wi(u))vj \u2265 0 ; \u03b7ij(Xi \u2212 wi(u))(Xj \u2212 wj(u)) = 0 . 7 Let Xi \u2212 wi(u) = r ki then ki ki = 0 and ki vi = +1. Parametrise the direction of ki by x, y such that ki = P\u22121 0 ( \u2212x,\u2212y,\u22121 + 1 4 (x2 + y2), 1 + 1 4 (x2 + y2) ) , and then the normalisation ki vi = +1 implies P0 = x v 1(u) + y v2(u) + { 1\u2212 1 4 (x2 + y2) } v3(u) + { 1 + 1 4 (x2 + y2) } v4(u) . Whittaker observed that the Lie\u00b4nard\u2013Wiechert 4\u2013potential Ai = e vi r \u21d2 Ai,i = 0 = \u0003Ai , could be written, modulo a gauge transformation, in the form Ai = e vi r = KijF,j + \u2217KijG,j , where Kij = \u2212Kji is a constant real bivector, with \u2217Kij = 12\u01ebijklKkl its dual, and F,G are real\u2013valued functions each satisfying the Minkowskian wave equation \u0003F = 0 and \u0003G = 0 . To establish this in coordinates x, y, r, u we need \u2202 \u2202Xi = \u2212P 2 0 r ( \u2202ki \u2202x \u2202 \u2202x + \u2202ki \u2202y \u2202 \u2202y ) + vi \u2202 \u2202r + ki { \u2202 \u2202u \u2212 (1\u2212 r ai ki) \u2202 \u2202r } , and \u0003 = \u2212P 2 0 r2 ( \u22022 \u2202x2 + \u22022 \u2202y2 ) \u2212 (1\u2212 2 ai ki r) ( \u22022 \u2202r2 + 2 r \u2202 \u2202r ) + 2 \u22022 \u2202u\u2202r + 2 r \u2202 \u2202u . In coordinates x, y, r, u Whittaker\u2019s two wave functions are [16] F = \u2212e 2 log(x2 + y2) and G = \u2212e tan\u22121 y x , (two harmonic functions) and thus \u2202F \u2202Xi = eP 20 r (x2 + y2) ( x \u2202ki \u2202x + y \u2202ki \u2202y ) , 8 and \u2202G \u2202Xi = eP 20 r (x2 + y2) ( x \u2202ki \u2202y \u2212 y \u2202ki \u2202x ) . Define Kij = \u03b4i3 \u03b4 j 4 \u2212 \u03b4i4 \u03b4j3 and Lij = \u03b4i1 \u03b4j2 \u2212 \u03b4i2 \u03b4j1 = \u2217Kij , then Ai = KijF,j + \u2217KijG,j = e vi r + \u03b7ij \u03a8,j , with \u03a8 = e log{r P\u22121 0 \u221a x2 + y2} . Whittaker pointed out that this decomposition is analogous to the splitting of a plane light wave into two plane polarised components. A notable fact is that almost every vacuum Maxwell field can be resolved into two parts in this way. The presentation of Whittaker\u2019s observation in coordinates x, y, r, u facilitates the derivation of the explicit decomposition (see [16]) for the Goldberg\u2013Kerr electromagnetic field [17]. The second, and final, part of the introduction, to enable us to appreciate Synge\u2019s contribution, involves a simple proof of this decomposition of a vacuum Maxwell field in general. We are working in Minkowskian space\u2013time and we shall write the line element as given above in rectangular Cartesian coordinates and time Xi = (X,Y,Z, T ) with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. In addition we shall make use of the following basis vector fields: ki \u2202 \u2202Xi = \u2202 \u2202Z + \u2202 \u2202T , li \u2202 \u2202Xi = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202Z + \u2202 \u2202T , mi \u2202 \u2202Xi = \u2202 \u2202X + i \u2202 \u2202Y , m\u00afi \u2202 \u2202Xi = \u2202 \u2202X \u2212 i \u2202 \u2202Y . All scalar products (with respect to the Minkowskian metric) of the pairs of these vectors vanish except ki li = +2 and m i m\u00afi = \u22122. In what follows a complex self\u2013dual bivector satisfies: Aij = \u2212Aji and \u2217Aij = iAij and a complex anti\u2013self\u2013dual bivector satisfies: Bij = \u2212Bji and \u2217Bij = \u2212iBij , with the star denoting the Hodge dual. A basis of complex anti\u2013self\u2013dual bivectors is given by mij = mi kj \u2212mj ki , nij = m\u00afi lj \u2212 m\u00afj li , 9 and lij = mi m\u00afj \u2212 m\u00afimj + li kj \u2212 lj ki . Let Fij = \u2212Fji be a candidate for a real Maxwell bivector. Since Fij + i\u2217Fij is an anti\u2013self\u2013dual complex bivector it can be expanded on the basis above as Fij + i \u2217Fij = \u03c60 nij + \u03c61 lij + \u03c62mij , where \u03c60, \u03c61, \u03c62 are complex\u2013valued functions of X i. Maxwell\u2019s Equations (F ij + i\u2217F ij),j = 0 , imply integrability conditions for the existence of a complex\u2013valued function Q(Xi) such that: (a) Q is a wave function: \u0003Q = 0 \u21d4 m\u00afimj Q,ij = ki lj Q,ij ; (b) \u03c60 = 1 4 kimj Q,ij , \u03c61 = 1 4 ki lj Q,ij , \u03c62 = \u221214 li m\u00afj Q,ij . Let l\u00afij denote the complex conjugate of lij , then l\u00afij is self\u2013dual. Define Wij = 1 4 l\u00afi pQ,pj \u2212 1 4 l\u00afj pQ,pi = \u2212Wji . Since Q is a wave function it follows that Wij is anti\u2013self\u2013dual. Expressing Wij on the anti\u2013self\u2013dual bivector basis, and using (b) above, results in Wij = Fij + i \u2217Fij . Hence with 1 4 l\u00afij = Kij \u2212 i\u2217Kij and Q = U + iV , we can write Fij = Ai,j \u2212Aj,i with Ai = Kij U,j + \u2217Kij V,j . Thus in general an analytic solution of Maxwell\u2019s vacuum field equations on Minkowskian space\u2013time can be constructed from a pair of real wave functions U, V and a constant real bivector Kij = \u2212Kji. The classic paper on this type of result for zero rest mass, spin s fields is that of Penrose [18] (see also Stewart [19]). When I wrote out this proof (incorporated into [20]) and sent it to Synge his response was characteristic. He worked it all out for himself and sent me the following proof in December, 1985: 10 Synge\u2019s proof begins with Lemma: With Xi = (X,Y,Z, T ), \u03b7ij = diag(\u22121,\u22121,\u22121,+1), Fij = \u2212Fji a Maxwell field so that F ij ,j = 0 ; Fj,k + Fki,j + Fjk,i = 0 then Fij = 0 at T = 0 \u21d2 Fij = 0 for all T . \u201cYou cannot make energy out of nothing\u201d (Synge) Corollary: If Fij and Hij are Maxwell fields then Fij = Hij at T = 0 \u21d2 Fij = Hij for all T . With these preliminaries Synge stated the following: Theorem: Given a Maxwell field Fij and Hij = Ki l U,lj + \u2217Ki l V,lj \u2212Kj l U,li \u2212 \u2217Kj l V,li , with Kij = \u2212Kji = constants and U, V wave functions, then Hij is a Maxwell field and there exists Kij , U, V such that Hij = Fij at T = 0 . Comment: Clearly Hij is a solution of Maxwell\u2019s equations. The choice of Kij , U, V is not unique. The theorem demands only their existence. Proof: Choose Kij = \u03b4i3 \u03b4 j 4 \u2212 \u03b4i3 \u03b4j4 then \u2217Kij = \u03b4i1 \u03b4j2 \u2212 \u03b4i2 \u03b4j1 and writing out Hij = Fij at T = 0 we find the following pairs of equations for the Cauchy data U, V, U,4, V,4 for the wave functions at T = 0: (all equations evaluated at T = 0) (A): (U,4),1 = F13 + V,23 and (U,4),2 = F23 \u2212 V,13 ; (B): (V,4),1 = F24 \u2212 U,23 and (V,4),2 = \u2212F14 + U,13 ; (C): U,11 + U,22 = \u2212F34 and V,11 + V,22 = \u2212F12 . If the equations (A) are consistent and if the equations (B) are consistent then (A), (B) and (C) can in principle be solved for the Cauchy data. The consistency follows from the assumption that Fij is a Maxwell field since then (A) implies that (U,4),12 \u2212 (U,4),21 = F13,2 \u2212 F23,1 + V,232 + V,131 = F13,2 + F32,1 + F21,3 = 0 , 11 and (B) implies that (V,4),12 \u2212 (V,4),21 = F24,2 + F14,1 \u2212 U,232 \u2212 U,131 = F24,2 + F14,1 + F34,3 = 0 , and the theorem is established. 5 Epilogue When visitors came to the Center for Relativity in the University of Texas at Austin, Alfred Schild, the founder of the Center and one of Synge\u2019s former collaborators [21] would enthusiastically point out to them that this was where Roy Kerr found his solution. This raises the question: what were the stand\u2013out works produced in Professor Synge\u2019s school of relativity in Dublin? I discussed this with George Ellis some time ago and we concluded that Felix Pirani\u2019s study of the physical significance of the Riemann tensor [22] and Werner Israel\u2019s proof of the uniqueness of the static black hole (uncharged [23] and charged [24]) are arguably the most profound products of Synge\u2019s school. When Synge turned ninety years of age a small conference was organised in his honour. His status within Ireland was reflected in the report in a na- tional newspaper which stated: \u201cPresident Hillery [Head of State] attended a special event in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies yesterday to wish a happy 90th. birthday to Professor Emeritus J. L. Synge, Ireland\u2019s most distinguished mathematician of the present century. Although he has been retired for fifteen years, the professor, a nephew of the playwright J. M. Synge, published three papers last year and has two more at present in the course of publication\u201d [Irish Times, 23rd. March, 1987]. My photograph of Professor Synge (Figure 1 above) was taken in July, 1987 in my back garden. Also present were two of Synge\u2019s former students, Dermott Mc Crea (see [4], [5] and [7] for example) and Stephen O\u2019Brien (of the O\u2019Brien\u2013Synge junction conditions [25]) together with Bill Bonnor who was visiting from the University of London.
