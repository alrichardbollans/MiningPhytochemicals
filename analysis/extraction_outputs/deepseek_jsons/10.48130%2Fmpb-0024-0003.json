Some of them are not only used as a food source, but has alsobeen used for the treatment of various diseases including pain, rheumatism, chronic pharyngitis and arthritis in China since ancient times. In thisreview, we would like to summarize previous research on genus Gnaphalium, including traditional uses, phytochemistry, bioactivities and qualitycontrol. The data presented here on genus Gnaphalium was generated based on various scientific research databases, including SciFinder,PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley library, Web of Science, and CNKI. Analysis of these findings showed that plants in genus Gnaphalium have a capitalpower in various therapeutic uses, including pulmonary protection, antimicrobial activity, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory and anti-complementary activities, and antidiabetic effect. Consistent with this, the chemicals from the plant extracts revealed its richness in variouschemicals, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids, sterols, and others. In spite of its wide applicable value worldwide, the quality controlof genus Gnaphalium is still based on local standards. Thus, we argue that a national standard is required for genus Gnaphalium in China, tovalidate its bioactivity and future clinical trials rigorously.Citation: Wang X, Liu D, Xiong L, Dunzhu B, Zhang L, et al. 2024. Ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, bioactivities and quality control of theGnaphalium genus: an updated review. Medicinal Plant Biology 3: e005 https://doi.org/10.48130/mpb-0024-0003 IntroductionThe genus Gnaphalium (family Asteraceae) contains ~200species scattered throughout the world, including China,Mexico, Argentina, North Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, India,and Australia[1,2]. It is documented that several species havelong been used for treating asthma, cough, phlegm, rheuma-tism, and other disorders. In addition, Gnaphalium affine andGnaphalium hypoleucum are served as vegetables in southernChina[3,4]. Although Zheng et al. reviewed several chemicalsand pharmacological functions of Gnaphalium in 2013[5], manybioactive chemical compounds have been identified afterwardin different Gnaphalium species to verify and validate theirmedicinal applications. Here, we summarize the recent achieve-ments in investigation of the ethnopharmacological applica-tion, phytochemicals, pharmacological effect, and qualitycontrol study of genus Gnaphalium. Furthermore, the limita-tions of the existing studies and future directions of Gnaphal-ium research are discussed to provide ideas for future researchand development.

As early as the Jin Dynasty, G. affine hadbeen used together with glutinous rice to make cakes forhuman consumption (Fig. 1). Not only Chinese, the Japanesealso used it for cooking porridge, and gradually people foundthat G. affine has certain pharmacological effects. To date,hundreds of species in Gnaphalium are found across the worlds,several of them have been recorded as traditional medicine inAsia, including China, Japan, and Korean, as well as countries inAmerica (Mexico and Argentina). Most of these reports arerelated to the management of rheumatism, cough, and asthma.Additionally, some species are also used to treat bacterial andfungal infections, diarrhea, cancer, respiratory infections, andseveral other conditions (Table 1). In China, several registereddrugs have been developed from Gnaphalium species, such as'Fufang Fuercao Heji (\u590d\u65b9\u4f5b\u8033\u8349\u5408\u5242)', containing G. affine asthe main component, and used for the management of chronicobstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs)[6]. Recently, G. affinecan also be used as a vegetable for making spices and func-tional yogurts[7]. Apart from the medical and edible values, G.affine is also used as natural dye for silk coloring in Yunnan,China. PhytochemistryThere are multiple previous studies focusing on the chemi-cals in Gnaphalium species. To date, 257 compounds have beenidentified and characterized. The existing literature indicatesthe existence of multiple components, predominantly inflavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. Some ofthese components are directly or indirectly attributed to thepharmacological activities of plants in the genus Gnaphalium.According to previous research, the chemical studies of thegenus Gnaphalium have mainly focused on G. affine, G. hypoleu-cum, G. sylvaticum, G. undulatum, G. oligandrum, G. pellitum, G.oxyphyllum, and G. adnatum. Here, the structures and otherinformation of these identified compounds are summarized inFigs 2\u221212 and Table 2, respectively. a b cFig. 1 The morphology of the Gnaphalium affine and its processed products.

[35] Updated review of Gnaphalium genusPage 2 of 18 Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 FlavonoidsFlavonoids are very common compounds in the genusGnaphalium. Several studies have described flavonoids as achemical index for the quality study of the herbs in Gnaphal-ium, even though they are not included in the Chinese Pharma-copoeia. Nevertheless, the flavonoid content in Gnaphalium isnot high and varies significantly in different regions[36,37].To date, over 100 flavonoids have been authenticated ingenus Gnaphalium, which are mainly classified as flavonol,dihydroflavone, chalcone, and others. In flavonol, quercetin isthe most significant aglycone, while luteolin and apigenin arethe main skeletons in other flavonoids. Among the flavoneglycosides in Gnaphalium, glucose is the main substitutedgroup, which are mostly located in C-7 of flavonoids, except forC-3-substituted glucose in isorhamnetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyra-noside (47), patuletin-3-O-\u03b2-D\u2013glucopyranoside (48),quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (57), kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (61), 3,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxy-3'-methoxyfla-vonoid-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (72), and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahy-droxy-6-methoxyflavonoid-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (73).Interestingly, another type of flavone glycosides, includingquercetin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (46), Fig. 2 Structures of flavones in genus Gnaphalium. Fig. 3 Structures of flavonols in genus Gnaphalium.Updated review of Gnaphalium genus Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Page 3 of 18apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (40),apigenin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (1), luteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (25), 5,7,3',4'-Tetrahy-droxy-6-methoxyflavonoid-7-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyra-noside (26), and naringenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyra-noside (97), were isolated from G. affine, which contain anE-caffeoyl group in the flavone glycosides[57]. The informationof the aforementioned flavonoids are presented in Figs 2\u22124and Table 2, respectively. TerpenoidsTerpenes and terpenoids are very common natural productsin the world, and over 22,000 chemicals have been identifiedfrom various plants[58]. Because of the basic five-carbon isopreneunits in terpenes and terpenoids, they were divided into monoter-penoids, sesquiterpenes, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids withdistinct functional groups[59,60]. Due to its diverse structures,several activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic,antioxidant, anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial properties,have been reported[61]. In this review, 50 terpenes and terpe-noids were identified in genus Gnaphalium (Figs 5\u22128, Table 2).Here, we will focus on these compounds and provide anoverview of terpenes and terpenoids in genus Gnaphalium. TriterpenoidsTriterpenoids usually contain six five-carbon isoprene units.Normally, these units can be connected into different carbonring and formed different types of triterpenoids. The majortriterpenoids (105\u2013120) isolated from genus Gnaphaliummainly use amyrin and ursolic acid as structural skeletons, andmost of them are distributed in G. affine, except for squalene inG. gaudichaudianum. Among them, eight ursane triterpenes(109\u2013116) are the most abundant, followed by four oleananetriterpenes (105\u2013108). Also, three lupane triterpenes(117\u2013119) and one chain triterpene (120) identified in G. affine.All information, including names, structures and source plantsof triterpenoids, are listed in Table 2 and Fig. 5. Fig. 4 Chalcones and flavanones isolated from the genus Gnaphalium. Fig. 5 Structures of triterpenoids in genus Gnaphalium. Updated review of Gnaphalium genusPage 4 of 18 Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 DiterpenoidsUp to now, 37 diterpenoids are identified in genus Gnaphal-ium, and most of them possess (\u2013)-pimara-8(14), 15-diene and(\u2013) kaurene as chemical skeletons. In total, 22 kaurane diter-penes (132\u2013147, 151\u2013156), nine pimarane diterpenes(121\u2013127, 148, 140), four labane diterpenes (128\u2013131) wereidentified. In addition, there is one rare diterpene (157), whichwas a 15-hydroxy substituted wedeliaseccokaurenolide, from G.undulatum. The structures, names and source plants of diter-penes in genus Gnaphalium are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 2.By comparing the distribution of different compounds in genusGnaphalium, it is found that diterpenes are the main compo-nent of G. gaudichaudianum, which can be regarded as amarker of G. gaudichaudianum to distinguish from otherspecies. SesquiterpenoidsA total of 20 sesquiterpenoids were isolated from genusGnaphalium. Among them, 185 and 186 are isolated from G.oligandrum, while 170, 172, 176, and 177 are from G. japon-icum. The specific information, including names and sourceplants of these compounds, are listed in Table 2. MonoterpenoidsFive monoterpenoids were identified from G. affine(178\u2013182). Phenolic acidsPhenolic acids are normally considered as antioxidantsbecause of the presence of phenol moiety and the ability toinduce endogenous protective enzymes[62]. Also, phenolic acidshave demonstrated anti-diabetic potential by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, converting carbohydrates intoglucose[63]. Furthermore, compared to methyl ester and butylester, the inhibitory effect of phenolic acid on microbial growthhas been extensively investigated[64]. In genus Gnaphalium, 27phenolic acids are isolated and identified, most of them arefrom G. affine. Additionally, caffeoyl substituted quinic acid is aspecial type of phenolic acids, in which quinic acid and caffeioylgroups are connected via the ester bond (Fig. 9, Table 2). Steroids and sterolsSterol compounds are structurally composed of four-cycliccompounds with a cyclopentanoperophenanthrene nucleus[65].However, only seven steroids have been authenticated in the Fig. 6 Diterpenoids isolated from the genus Gnaphalium.Updated review of Gnaphalium genus Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Page 5 of 18genus Gnaphalium. Among them, \u03b2-sitosterol (212) wasconfirmed to exist in G. affine, G. hypoleucum, G. inornatum, G.pellitum, G. oxyphyllum, G. liebmannii, and G. viscosum. Amongthe species, all the steroids were identified from G. affine. Oneglycosides, \u03b2-daucosterin (210), was isolated from G.affine,G.adnatum, and G.hypoleucum[38]. AlkaloidsAlkaloid compounds typically contain nitrogen atoms in theirstructures[66]. Currently, seven alkaloid (217\u2013223) compoundshave been found in the genus Gnaphalium. OthersIn addition to the previously reported compounds, othertypes of compounds, including sterols, amino acids, tannins,polysaccharides, etc., have also been isolated from genusGnaphalium[48] (Fig. 12, Table 2) . Pharmacology Pulmonary protectionMost varieties of Gnaphalium are traditionally used to treatseveral respiratory diseases, such as asthma, cough, bronchitis,and bronchial infections. In the guinea pig tracheal experiment,the effect of methanol extract of G. conoideum on contractileagonist response was studied, and it was found that G.conoideum significantly reduced the contractile response tohistamine by partially blocking Ca2+ channels[67]. Likewise, thetension change experiment of guinea pig tracheal segmentswas used to evaluate the anti-asthmatic effect of G. liebmannii,showing that the hexane extract can cause the concentrationresponse curve of aminophenol to shift parallel to the right in acompetitive manner, rather than causing the concentrationresponse curve of histamine to shift parallel to the right, indi-cating that G. liebmannii can act as a phosphodiesteraseinhibitor for tracheal muscle relax[68]. Additionally, G. affine isused as traditional medicine to treat expectorant and cough inChina. Ye et al. evaluated the antitussive and expectorant acti-vities of total flavonoids from G. affine in vivo, showing thatmacroporous resin-purified total flavonoids (purity: 40.13%)significantly decreased the number of cough times during 5min and alleviated sputum secretion[69,70]. Similarly, the pretreat-ment of G. affine significantly decreased the inflammatorycytokines in alveolar lavage fluid of COPD (chronic obstructivepulmonary disease) rats[70]. Moreover, eight bioactive com-pounds were identified from G. affine extract through activity-guided fractionation, in which luteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (27) displayed remarkable noncompetitive inhibitionkinetics against human neutrophil elastase (HNE)[71].

Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Antimicrobial activityThe crude extracts and isolated plant compounds extractedfrom different species in Gnaphalium have antibacterial proper-ties. For example, Caceres et al. investigated the antibacterialactivity of the ethanolic extract from G. stramineum and G.visco-sum against eight strains of bacteria including Escherichia coli,Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae,Shiegella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pneu-monia, and Staphylococcus pyogenes. Interestingly, extract fromG. stramineum showed promising inhibitory effect against S.typhi and S. dysenteriae (\u2265 9 mm), which are involved ingastrointestinal disorders; while extract from G. viscosum had astrong inhibitory effect against S. pneumonias and S. pyogenesthat are associated with respiratory disease[32,72]. Additionally,G. gaudichaudianum methanol extract suppressed the growthof Sporothrix schenckii and Fonsecaea pedrosoi with MIC valuesof 50 and 12.5 \u00b5g/mL, respectively; and methanol, hexanic, andchloroformic extracts of G. hirsutum inhibited the growth ofStreptococcus pyogenes[73]. The antimicrobial activity of extractsfrom different parts of G. oxyphyllum var. oxyphyllum hexanicwas also evaluated, and demonstrated that the flower extractshowed more broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect comparedwith the leaves extract[74].Currently, it is believed that the antibacterial effect of G. poly-caulon is related to its secondary metabolites. Previous studyused Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylo-coccus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains to test theantibacterial activity of chemicals in G. polycaulon, showing thatthe antibacterial activity of 255\u2013257 with MIC values of0.0077\u201344.85 \u00b5M[75]. Moreover, eugenol and linalool, the mainessential oil in G. affine showed remarkable antimicrobial effectin food-borne microorganisms test[7]. In addition, eugenolcould significantly reduce biofilm formation of Vibrio para-haemolyticus in Ashrafudoulla et al.'s research[76]. Antioxidant activityThe ethanol extract of G. roseum, which mainly containedflavonoids and phenols, exerted an antioxidant effect by thefree radical scavenging test of \u03b1, \u03b1-diphenyl-\u03b2-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH), with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of~72.9 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b5g/mL. The antioxidant capacity of G. affine ethanolextract was demonstrated with the H2O2-induced oxidativestress, in which G. affine extract ameliorated oxidative reactionvia the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway in H9c2 cells, and17 compounds including phenols and flavonoids, were identi-fied in this extract by LC-MS analysis[77]. Moreover, 2,2'-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), superoxide,and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays were used to bio-guided isolate the antioxidant compounds in G. affine, reveal-ing quercetin (60) as the main antioxidant component[78]. Inaddition, flavonoids including apigenin (6), chrysin (11), Fig. 9 Phenolic acids isolated from the genus Gnaphalium.Updated review of Gnaphalium genus Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Page 7 of 18wogonin (101), and luteolin (10) were well-represented in theethanol extract of G. affine, and showed remarkable free radicalscavenging capacity[38]. Anti-inflammatory and anti-complementaryactivitiesCarrageenan-induced paw edema and collagen-inducedarthritis models were used test the anti-inflammatory activity ofG. affine ethanol extract, showing that the swelling caused bycarrageenan and the inflammation caused by collagen wereinhibited or reduced by 600 and 300 mg/kg extracts, respec-tively[79]. Another study showed that the methanol extract of G.affine decreased the expressions of iNOS and COX-2 inLPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by inhibiting the activation ofmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-\u03baB(NF-\u03baB) pathways[80]. Apart from G. affine, different polarsolvent extracts of G. stramineum demonstrated that the me-thanol extract suppressed the carrageenan-induced edema inrats[81]. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanol extractof G. affine resulted in the isolation of four anti-inflammatorycompounds, quercetin (60), luteolin (10), quercetin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside(46) and luteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (25), according to NO expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, luteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (25) was confirmed to exert anti-inflam-matory effect via suppressing the expression of COX-2[71].

Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Page 13 of 18The complement system is an essential part of the innateimmunity and plays an important role in inflammatoryreaction[82]. The anti-complementary activity of G. hypoleucumethanol extract and its fractions were assayed based on theclassical pathway of the complement system in vitro, revealingthat the total ethanol extract possessed a more potent anti-complementary effect (CH50 = 0.165 \u00b1 0.025)[83]. Through asystematic chemical study of G. hypoleucum, ursolic acid andluteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (25) wereshowed to have a strong inhibitory effect on the complementactivation, with CH50 values of 0.014 and 0.045 mg/mL, respec-tively. Additionally, 27 flavonoids were isolated from G. affine,providing a basis for exploring the structure-activity relation-ship of flavonoids in G. affine. By investigating the anti-comple-mentary effect of each flavonoid, the flavonol\u2013sugar\u2013aromaticside chain and the hydroxy group in C-4' in flavonoids playedan important role in anti-complementary activity[57]. Antidiabetic effectPersistent hyperglycemia is generally considered to berelated to insufficient insulin secretion and islet dysfunction orinsulin resistance, which can cause a variety of complications,including diabetes nephropathy and diabetes eye disease. Fornow, treatment for hyperglycemia is mainly through thepromoting glycolysis (dimethylbiguanide) and lowering post-prandial blood sugar (acarbose). Several studies showed thatvarious species in genus Gnaphalium can exert antidiabeticeffect. Sun et al. evaluated the antidiabetic activity of totalflavonoid extract of G. hypoleucum in both in vivo and in vitromodels, and isolated the relevant compounds that may func-tion in this process[84]. Total flavonoid extract of G. hypoleucumshowed a significant \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 =20.30 \u00b1 3.45 \u00b5M) in vitro, and total flavonoids at 150 mg/kgsignificantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG)after 10 d (p < 0.05) in vivo in streptozotocin (STZ)-induceddiabetic mice. Moreover, components including oleanolic acid(107), ursolic acid (110), 19\u03b1-hydroxyl ursolic acid (113), andluteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-(6''-E-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside (25) showedsignificant \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, more effectivethan acarbose. In another study, Lu et al. isolated threecompounds, including 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (203),3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (204), and 2',4,4'-trihydroxy-6'-methoxychalcone-4'-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (96) from G. affine,which can inhibit \u03b1-amylase activity[85]. Anti-hyperuricemia and gouty effectHyperuricemia is often associated with excessive productionor insufficient excretion of uric acid (UA) in the body. When theserum uric acid concentration exceeds the solubility of uricacid, uric acid crystals will form in tissues such as the kidneysand joints, leading to kidney disease and gout[86]. Previous liter-ature has reported several renal organic anion transporters,such as glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) and uric acid transporter1 (URAT1), involved in mediating uric acid excretion. Moreover,xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the oxida-tion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and further to uric acid.

Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005species in Gnaphalium have been used as a folk medicine forthe relief of anti-inflammatory, antitussive, gout and expecto-rant activities, etc. Therefore, the anti-hyperuricemia and acutegouty effects of G. affine and G. pensylvanicum were investi-gated by determining the uric acid content in potassiumoxonate induced hyperuricemic mice, revealing the significantanti-hyperuricemia and acute gouty effects of G. affine and G.pensylvanicum ethanol extracts via inhibiting xanthine oxidaseactivity in a concentration dependent manner (100, 200, and400 mg/kg)[87,88]. Notably, the expressions of GLUT9 and URAT1were also increased in mice treated with G. affine and G. pensyl-vanicum extracts for seven days compared with that in thecontrol group. These studies suggest that the mechanism ofanti-hyperuricemia and acute gouty effects by G. affine and G.pensylvanicum might be involved in both xanthine oxidaseinhibition and uric acid excretion.In order to verify the functional chemicals produced by G.hypoleucum in this process, the anti-gouty chemicals werescreened in G. hypoleucum via xanthine oxidase inhibitionassay. Luteolin-4'-O-glucoside (7) and luteolin (10) were identi-fied, showing strong xanthine oxidase inhibition activities withIC50 values of 0.26 and 0.43 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Moreover,their significant anti-hyperuricemia and acute gouty effectswere further confirmed in vivo via inhibiting the xanthineoxidase activity in a concentration dependent manner (20, 40,and 100 mg/kg). In addition, the expressions of GLUT9 andURAT1 were increased in mice treated with luteolin-4'-O-gluco-side (7) and luteolin (10) for six days compared with that in thecontrol group. The paw swelling was also decreased by luteolin(10) and luteolin-4'-O-glucoside (7) in a dose-dependentmanner in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced mice[89]. Other activitiesApart from the above pharmacological effects, other activi-ties of Gnaphalium have been reported recently. The waterextract of G. affine exhibited a protective effect for carbon tetra-chloride-induced acute liver injury[90]. A polysaccharide of G.affine could enhance the expression of ALPase expressionsynergistically with ascorbate from the early differentiationstage of MC3T3-E1 cells[91]. Two flavone isomers from G. elegansexibited remarkable anti-tumor effects, and four flavonoids 78,62, 63, and 92 isolated from the root of G. affine haveantifeedant activity, and studies have suggested that the intro-duction of a methyl ether on the B-ring of the flavonoiddecreased antifeedant activity in insect[92,93]. Quality controlAt present, there is no national standard for Gnaphalium inChina, and its quality control is mainly based on local standards.Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to strengthen research onthe quality control of Gnaphalium. Regarding the quality stan-dards of Gnaphalium, literature reports mostly focus on thequalitative and quantitative analysis of flavonoids and pheno-lic components. The content of quercetin (60) in G. affine, G.pensylvanicum, G. japonicum, and G. adnatum was basicallydetermined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and ultravio-let\u2013visible spectrophotometry (UV\u2013vis)[94]. Additionally, Tianused high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to deter-mine the contents of quercetin (60), luteolin (10), and luteolin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-glucose (7) in G. affine[37], as well as several phenolsincluding protocatechuic acid (183), chlorogenic acid (206),caffeic acid (184), and 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (200)[95].HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were also used todetermine and compare the contents of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinicacid (203), chlorogenic acid (206), kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-gluco-side (61), apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside (3), quercetin (60) andluteolin (10) in G. affine[96]. Quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker (QAMS) method was recentlyestablished to determine the contents of chlorogenic acid(206), caffeic acid (184) and eupatilin (38) in G. affine, usingchlorogenic acid (206) as the reference substance[97,98]. Inaddition, pharmacokinetic studies have shown that caffeic acidand caffeioylquinic acids in G. affine have a significant accumu-lation effect in uric acid nephropathy (UAN) rats, suggestingcaffeic acid and caffeioylquinic acids might be the activecomponents to treat UAN[99]. The above detection methodsprovide a certain basis for the quality evaluation research ofGnaphalium, but more detection technologies are still needed,such as gene sequencing and fingerprint chromatography, toverify confused varieties and establish a scientific qualitycontrol system. Conclusions and perspectivesAs a medical plant used worldwide, Gnaphalium plants aretraditionally used to treat cough, phlegm, asthma, rheumatism,and other disorders. Flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolic acidsare the main chemical components and pharmacological ingre-dients in Gnaphalium. The pharmacological effects of Gnaphal-ium are mainly manifested in pulmonary protection, antimicro-bial activity, anti-inflammatory and anti-complementary activi-ties, antioxidant activity, antidiabetic effect, anti-hyperuricemiaand gout effect, etc. There are also traditional Chinese medicinepreparations with G. affine as tea on the market, which aremainly used for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. Thisreview summarized previous research on genus Gnaphalium,including traditional uses, phytochemistry, bioactivities andquality control. However, there are several key issues worthpondering to further develop the medicinal potential ofGnaphalium.First, more than 200 species in Gnaphalium have been foundworldwide and over 200 compounds have been isolated andidentified from Gnaphalium including flavonoids, terpenoids,phenolic acids, steroids, sterols, and other components. How-ever, there are still disputes about the classification of Gnaphal-ium. Recently, Nie et al. divided Gnaphalium into two clades,Gnaphalium and Pseudognaphalium, using ITS and ETSsequencing[100]. Therefore, more comprehensive detectionmethods, including botanical phenotype, chemical interpreta-tion and gene sequencing of each species, are still needed todescribe the Gnaphalium taxonomy precisely.Second, the present toxicological research of genus Gnapha-lium needs to be further strengthened. As we know, somespecies in Gnaphalium are used as vegetable and food ingredi-ents, with relatively low toxicity. However, further toxicologicalresearch is still required, especially for the long-term uses withlarge doses of poor extracts. The toxicity of each species ofGnaphalium should be comprehensively evaluated, includingheavy metals and contaminations of pesticide residues, toprovide a scientific basis for the safe use as both drug and food.Third, at present, there is no unified national quality stan-dard for genus Gnaphalium, and most of them are based onlocal standards. Moreover, only TLC or HPLC methods wereused in some local standards, which might not reflect thecomprehensive quality of Gnaphalium. Therefore, it isUpdated review of Gnaphalium genus Wang et al. Medicinal Plant Biology 2024, 3: e005 Page 15 of 18necessary to further strengthen the basic research on qualitycontrol, such as HPLC fingerprint, multiple component determi-nation, and Q-marker establishment in Gnaphalium as soon aspossible.
