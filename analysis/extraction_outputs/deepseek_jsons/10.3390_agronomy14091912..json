The objective of thestudy was to characterize the phytochemistry of the shoots and roots of A. ochroleuca and determinewhether the extracts could inhibit the germination of maize seeds. The shoots and roots of A. ochroleucawere extracted in water, hexane, and acetone. Ten maize seeds were used in the germination bioassay.A phytochemical analysis was conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The effects of the A. ochroleuca water, hexane, or acetone extracts on maize seed germination wereconcentration and plant-part dependent. The highest reduction was recorded from the water extractwith 82%. Identified compounds with high percentages in A. ochroleuca were 9,12-octadecadienoicacid (Z,Z) and 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, (Z,Z,Z)-. The present study indicated that A. ochroleucaextracts suppress the germination of maize seeds, likely due to the presence of both the identifiedand potentially unidentified phytochemicals that were not detected by the selected method. Thereis, however, a need to establish the relationship between the phytochemical compounds and theenzymes responsible for germination.Keywords: allelopathic; phytochemicals; phytotoxicity; plant extracts1. IntroductionMaize (Zea mays L.) is a major crop grown all over the world and is considered themost significant grain crop [1]. Its high production is due to its several functions as a humanand animal food source [2]. Maize is a staple food source for approximately 200 millionpeople globally, contributing an estimated 15% of protein and 20% of calories to the humandiet [2]. Murdia et al. [3] reported that maize can be cultivated in a variety of agro-climaticzones, which makes it an adaptable crop, in contrast to many other crops. In South Africa, itis produced throughout the country in diverse environments [4]. The top three provinces inSouth Africa for growing maize, which collectively contribute to nearly 83% of the country\u2019stotal output, are North West, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal [5]. South Africa [6] isranked among the top 10 maize-producing countries in the world [6,7]. Since 1995, maizehas been grown on about three to four million hectares of agricultural land, accounting forabout 60 to 70% of the arable area [8]. However, the production of this crop is threatened byalien invasive weeds that release allelochemicals that inhibit seed germination and growth.Mexican poppy [Argemone ochroleuca (Sweet)] is an alien invasive weed with potentialbiological inhibition properties to other plants [9]. Dar et al. [10] reported that both theshoot and root parts of A. ochroleuca released water-soluble phytotoxins that decreasedAgronomy 2024, 14, 1912. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14091912 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomyAgronomy 2024, 14, 1912 2 of 13the germination of Farsetia aegyptia Turra, Salvia aegyptiaca, Hordeum vulgare, and Medicagosativa. Essential oils of A. ochroleuca showed significant phytotoxic activity against Lactucasativa and Peganum harmala, thus inhibiting their germination and decreasing seedlinggrowth [11]. These findings are supported by the study by Mlombo et al. [12] and Nxumaloet al. [13], who reported the inhibition of the germination and seedling length of commonbean and maize, and millet, respectively.A study by Paul and Begum [14] reported that the leaf and root extracts of A. mexicanadecreased the germination of Brassica napus, Triticum, and Vigna mungo. Namkeleja et al. [15]reported that A. mexicana extract concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100% significantly de-creased the mean germination of Brachiaria dictyoneura by 65, 50, 12.5, and 7.5%, respectively,and the mean germination of Clitoria ternatea by 77.5, 77.5, 37, and 25%, respectively. Thiswas also observed by Miranda-Ar\u00e1mbula et al. [16], who reported that aqueous extracts ofA. mexicana decreased the germination of tomato and lettuce.Brahmachari et al. [17] reported that terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics, and flavonoidswere among the metabolites discovered through the chemical characterization of A. mexi-cana. Joshi et al. [18] also reported various kinds of secondary metabolites that includedalkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, phenol, lignins, saponins, sterols, and tannins in thephytochemical screening of A. mexicana leaves. The presence of allelochemicals such asphenolics and other secondary metabolites like terpenoids, and alkaloids could be responsi-ble for inhibiting seed germination and seedling growth, and could potentially reduce theyield potential of maize. It was, however, reported that the presence and concentrations ofthese phytochemicals vary with the plants\u2019 growing environment [19]. Hence, the aim ofthis study was to characterize the phytochemistry of the shoots and roots of A. ochroleucaand determine whether the same extracts could inhibit the germination of maize seeds. Theexpected outcomes include the identification of key phytochemicals in Argemone ochroleucaextracts as well as evidence showing that these extracts inhibit maize seed germination.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Description of Study AreaThe study was conducted at the University of Mpumalanga (25.4365\u25e6 S, 30.9818\u25e6 E),South Africa, under controlled laboratory conditions from November 2021 to May 2022.Maize seeds of cultivar SC 513 (Seed Co, Zimbabwe) were purchased from NTK, Nelspruit,South Africa.2.2. Collection and Preparation of Argemone ochroleuca Plant ExtractsArgemone ochroleuca plant material was collected from the University of Mpumalangafarm, with the botanical identity of the plant confirmed by the H.G.W.J. SchweickerdtHerbarium (PRU), Pretoria, South Africa and given the voucher number PRU 130499. Theshoots and roots of A. ochroleuca were separated and cleaned thoroughly with running tapwater. The collected shoots and roots were placed inside brown paper bags and dried inan oven (Memmet UN 110, Lasec, Cape Town, South Africa) set at a temperature of 55 \u25e6Cfor 72 h. The dried plant material were then ground in an electric grinder (heavy dutyprofessional blender BBS1200, Summit Pro Blend, China) and sieved into a conical flaskusing a 2 mm sieve.2.3. Preparation of Crude ExtractsA total of 100 g of the shoots and roots were separately extracted in 1000 mL of water,hexane, and acetone.Aqueous water extract: Extraction was conducted using deionized water and left atroom temperature (25 \u25e6C) for 24 h. Each mixture was filtered using a 2 \u00b5m sieve, with theresultant aqueous concentrate considered as a 100% concentration. Concentrations of 10,20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 mL were prepared in 100 mL bottles by adding deionizedwater, as previously stated by Namkeleja et al. [15].Agronomy 2024, 14, 1912 3 of 13Organic solvents: A 1000 mL of acetone and hexane were separately used to extractboth the shoots and roots, then the mixture was left at room temperature for 3 days withoccasional stirring. The resultant filtrates were concentrated using a stream of cold air fromthe lamina flow to obtain a dry residue. The acetone and hexane dry root and shoot extractresidues were used to make concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 g/L deionized water. Thesedilutions were kept at room temperature for 24 h. The extracts were then centrifuged at4000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant were used in the germination test [20].2.4. Germination BioassayGermination tests were conducted following the techniques of the International SeedTesting Association (ISTA) [21]. Briefly, maize seeds were separately surface sterilized for1 min by soaking them in 3% sodium hypochlorite and then washing with deionized watertwice, each for 3 min. Ten seeds per treatment were set in a 9-cm diameter Petri dish linedwith Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The seeds were treated with respective water extractsfrom the A. ochroleuca shoot or root concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,and 100%, whereas for the hexane and acetone extract bioassays, the seeds were separatelytreated with four concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 g/L. All treatments were replicatedthree times, and trials were duplicated three times for the water extracts and twice for thehexane and acetone extracts. The experiments were carried out under a growth chamber atroom temperature with 8 h of light for ten days, with germination counts taken daily untilthe tenth day.Seeds were considered as germinated when both the radicle and plumule were 2 mmlong [15]. On the tenth day, the last germination count was made along with measurementof plumule and radicle lengths. The germination percentage, germination speed, meangermination time, mean daily germination, and germination index were computed usingformulae previously described by Gairola et al. [22]:Germination % =Number o f germinated seeds in each Petri dishTotal number o f seeds in each Petri dish\u00d7 100Germination speed =n1d1+n2d2+n3d3\u00b1\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212where n = number of germinated seed and d = number of days.Mean germination time =n1 x d1 + n2 x d2 + n3 x d3 +\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212Total number o f dayswhere n = number of germinated seed, and d = number of days.Mean daily germination =Total number o f seeds germinatedTotal number o f daysGermination index = Number o f germinated seeds on day o f f irst countDay o f f irst count+ . . .

Phytochemical AnalysisTwo grams of each plant part was separately extracted in 20 mL of acetone, hexane,and hot distilled water. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min and filteredthrough Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The procedure was repeated twice to exhaustivelyextract the plant material; the second collection was undertaken after an hour. Filtrateswere concentrated by drying in front of a stream of cold air to obtain crude extracts. Thecrude extracts were stored in an air-tight container at 25 \u25e6C until further use.Agronomy 2024, 14, 1912 4 of 132.6. Phytochemical Analysis Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)Hexane and acetone extracts from the roots and shoots of A. ochroleuca were analyzedusing GC-MS. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were carried out using aLECO Pegasus 4D GC-TOFMS (LECO Africa (Pty) Ltd., Kempton Park, South Africa) witha Rxi-5SilMS GC column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm ID \u00d7 0.2 \u00b5m film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte,PA, USA). The following parameters were used: injection volume 1 \u00b5L; splitless injection;splitless time set at 30 s; GC inlet 250 \u25e6C; GC oven temperature program 40 \u25e6C (hold for3 min) at 10 \u25e6C/min to 300 \u25e6C (hold for 5 min); the carrier gas used was UHP helium (Afrox,South Africa) at 1 mL/min set at constant flow mode; mass acquisition range 40\u2013550 Da;MS transfer line temperature 280 \u25e6C; ion source temperature 230 \u25e6C; MS solvent delay5 min; electron energy 70 eV in the electron ionization mode (EI+); data acquisition rateof 10 spectra/s; and detector voltage of 1750 V. The resulting data were combined andinterpreted, and compounds corresponding to major peaks that showed a high similarity(above 85%) were recorded.2.7. Statistical AnalysisGermination data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) through Statistix10.0 software. The Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test was conducted to determine the normalityof the residual distribution before ANOVA [23]. The whole number variables that failedthe normality test (p \u2264 0.05) were transformed using Log10(x + 1), and arcsine\u221a(x \u00f7 100)was used for the percentage variables. Mean separation was achieved using Fisher\u2019s leastsignificant difference test at a 5% probability level.3. ResultsThere were no significant differences among the independent trials, hence the datawere pooled and reanalyzed. All data for the maize seed germination variables treatedwith the water, acetone, and hexane extracts were not normally distributed, except for thegermination speed of the hexane extract, hence the data were transformed accordingly.3.1. Effects of Argemone ochroleuca Water Extracts on Maize Seed GerminationThe interaction between the water extract concentrations and plant part factors (rootsand shoots) were highly significant (p \u2264 0.01) for germination speed, mean germinationtime, germination index, plumule length, and radicle length, whereas the interactionswere statistically significant (p \u2264 0.05) for the germination percentage and mean dailygermination. The concentration and plant parts as separate factors were highly significant(p \u2264 0.01) for all germination variables and seedling length variables. Generally, increasingthe water extract concentrations of both the root and shoot extracts significantly decreasedthe germination variables and seedling length variables, with significant root extracteffects being observed at 70% and above for the germination variables and 50% andabove for the plumule and radicle seedling lengths, whereas significant shoot extracteffects were observed at 40% and above for the germination and seedling length variables(Tables 1 and 2).In relation to the untreated control, the A. ochroleuca root extracts decreased the germi-nation percentage (18\u201333%), germination speed (11\u201321%), mean germination time (13%),mean daily germination (15\u201329%), germination index (17%), plumule length (20\u201344%), andradicle length (23\u201352%), whereas the A. ochroleuca shoot extracts decreased the germinationpercentage (21\u201355%), germination speed (18\u201348%), mean germination time (11\u201332%), meandaily germination (17\u201362%), germination index (14\u201343%), plumule length (24\u201373%), andradicle length (32\u201382%), respectively. There were highly significant differences betweenthe plant parts on all of the germination and seedling length variables, with extracts fromthe A. ochroleuca shoots significantly reducing all variables when compared to those fromthe roots.Agronomy 2024, 14, 1912 5 of 13Table 1.

Effects of Argemone ochroleuca Hexane Extracts on Maize Seed GerminationThe interaction between the concentration and plant part of the A. ochroleuca hexaneextract was statistically significant (p \u2264 0.05) for the germination percentage, germinationspeed, mean germination time, mean daily germination, plumule length, and radicle length,whereas the interaction was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) for the germination index.The concentration and plant parts of A. ochroleuca as separate factors were not statisticallysignificant (p > 0.05) for all germination variables and seedling length variables. Increasingthe concentration of the shoot extracts significantly decreased the germination percentage,germination speed, mean germination time, mean daily germination, plumule length,and radicle length. At a 2.5 g/L concentration and above, the germination variables andseedling variables were reduced by the shoot extracts. The hexane root extracts had noeffect on the germination variables, but stimulated the radicle length at a concentrationof 7.5 g/L.Agronomy 2024, 14, 1912 6 of 13In relation to the untreated control, the A. ochroleuca shoot extracts decreased the germi-nation percentage (27\u201338%), germination speed (31\u201343%), mean germination time (10\u201312%),mean daily germination (24\u201331%), plumule length (27%), and radicle length (26%), whereasthe A. ochroleuca root extracts stimulated the radicle length by 29% (Tables 3 and 4).Table 3.

Effects of Argemone ochroleuca Acetone Extracts on Maize Seed GerminationThe interaction between the A. ochroleuca acetone extract concentrations and plantparts was not significant (p > 0.05) for all of the maize germination and seed length vari-ables, except for the plumule length. The concentration as a separate factor was statisticallysignificant (p < 0.05) for all germination variables and was highly significant (p \u2264 0.01) forseedling length variables, whereas plant parts as a separate factor were not statisticallysignificant (p > 0.05) for all germination and seedling length variables. Increasing theextract concentrations significantly decreased the germination percentage and seedlingradicle length, whereas other measured variables were not different from the untreatedseeds. There was a concentration-dependent response on all of the germination vari-ables, with lower concentrations having a stimulative effect whereas higher concentrationshad inhibitory effects. In relation to the untreated control, the A. ochroleuca extracts de-creased the germination percentage (12\u201316%) and stimulated the radicle length by 40%(Figures 1 and 2).

DiscussionThis study showed that the A. ochroleuca shoots and roots have allelopathic effects thatinhibit maize seed germination. Similar results have been reported in other allelopathicstudies due to the inhibition of allelochemicals found in the plants [24,25]. Wang et al. [26]Agronomy 2024, 14, 1912 9 of 13reported that the enzyme activity and chlorophyll content of leaves from Amygdalus pe-dunculata varieties decreased with an increase in the aqueous leaf extract concentrationsof Amorpha fruticosa, Hedysarum mongolicum, Sabina vulgaris, and Hippophae rhamnoides.Mlombo et al. [12], working with common bean seeds, observed the allelopathic effectsof A. ochroleuca aqueous extracts on seed germination and early seedling growth. Theallelopathic effects of other weed extracts such as Argemone mexicana, Amaranthus hybridus,Parthenium hysterophorus, and Datura stramonium on wheat were recorded by Gella et al. [27].Kawawa et al. [28] explained the phenomenon as due to the allelochemicals inherent in theseplants when explaining the suppressed germination and growth responses of Cassia occidentalisseeds to Psidium guajava extracts. In a study by Namkeleja et al. [15], it was observed that theA. mexicana leaf and seed extracts significantly decreased the seed germination, shoot length,root length, and seedling length of Brachiaria dictyoneura and Clitoria ternatea.In the current study, it was also observed that there was a difference in the allelopathicresponse of the maize seed to the water, hexane, and acetone extracts. These findings weresimilar to findings by Akter et al. [29], who reported that aqueous extracts of Heliotropiumindicum leaves and roots were more inhibitory compared to the methanol extracts forseed germination Lagenaria siceraria. Sayed et al. [30] reported that the aqueous, ethanol,and acetone extracts of honey weed significantly decreased the germination percentage ofbrinjal, okra, amaranth, and cucumber. These findings are concurrent with the findings fromM\u2019barek et al. [31], who reported that acetone extracts of Tetraclinis articulate inhibited thegermination of barley, lettuce, radish, and tomato. Wang et al. [26] reported that the aqueousleaf extract concentrations of Amorpha fruticosa, Hedysarum mongolicum, and Sabina vulgarisat lower concentrations significantly promoted the seed germination and seedling growthof two Amygdalus pedunculata varieties. This is in agreement with the findings in the currentstudy where lower extract concentrations stimulated the germination and germinationvariables, with the effect much more prominent in the hexane root extracts. This maybe attributed to the stress effect of these extracts on plants, and may stimulate plants todefend themselves by increasing the concentration of some metabolites such as aminoacids, proteins, phenolics, and carbohydrates, a phenomenon known as hormesis [26].The concentration-dependent responses of the plants to the water, hexane, and acetonefractions revealed that all three fractions contained allelochemicals, but that the greatestpotential was in the water-soluble fraction [32]. The method used in extraction has also beenreported by other studies to influence the extract yield, hence the resultant allelochemicalcomposition of the extract [33].There was a difference in the allelopathic effects of the different plant parts wherebythe shoot extracts were inhibitory when compared to the root extracts. It was also reportedin a study by Paul and Begum [14] that the leaf and root extracts of Argemone mexicanahad different suppressive effects on the germination of wheat, blackgram, and rapeseed,whereas in some cases, the root extracts were more suppressive, and in others, the leafextracts had more suppressive effects. This was also observed by Huang et al. [34], whoreported that lower concentrations of Alternanthera philoxeroides root extracts stimulated theroot length, shoot length, and fresh weight of Zoysia matrella, while higher concentrationsinhibited the variables. This was also reported by Sitthinoi et al. [35], who observed thatdifferent extraction solvents and plant parts from where the extract was made showeddifferences in the inhibitory effect on the germination and seedling growth of rice. Thesefindings conform to a study conducted by Netsere [36], who reported that there weredifferences in the allelopathic response of different plant parts of Parthenium hysterophoruson the germination and seedling growth of maize and sorghum. Similar findings werereported by Sitthinoi et al. [35], who reported that the shoot extracts from jungle rice showedhigher inhibitory effects on the seedling dry weight and root length of rice compared tothe root extracts. Favaretto et al. [37] explained that the consistence of leaves as a source ofthe allelochemicals in various studies could not only be explained by their role as storageorgans, but also that they are the most metabolically active plant organs in the plant body,hence it is reasonable that they have a greater diversity of allelochemicals and thus a greaterAgronomy 2024, 14, 1912 10 of 13allelopathic effect. Based on the results from the current study, it is evident that A. ochroleucacontains allelochemicals that affect the germination, plumule, and radicle length of maize.Profiled chemicals in the roots and shoots indicated various chemicals includingfatty acids, sterols, and terpenoides. Previous studies have reported that the Argemonespecies contain phytochemicals such as benzoic acid, coptisine, cinnamic, protopine,berberine [38,39], and phenolic compounds such as salicylic acid, vanillic acid, and p-hydroxy benzoic acid [40]. These chemicals have been reported to potentially inhibitthe germination and seedling vigor of crops [9]. Tahir et al. [25] reported that moringaextracts were rich in octadec-9-enoic acid, nonacosane, methyl 12,15-octadecadienoateand 9-octadecenoic acid, and methyl ester, (E)-; in the same study, it was reported thatthese extracts inhibited and stimulated the germination and seedling growth of wheat andSinapus arvensis.The presence of 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, (Z,Z,Z)-, n-hexadecanoic acid, octadeca-dienoic acid (Z,Z)-, and \u00e1-sitosterol in the extracts of A. ochroleuca with their allelopathic effectson seed germination in the present study is supported by several studies. Wang et al. [41]reported similar compounds as the current study, which were extracted and identifiedfrom Humulus scandens root extracts and had potential allelopathic effects on Alternantheraphiloxeroides. Tahir et al. [25] also reported that 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z), identifiedfrom Pistacia atlantica Kurdica hexane leaf and seed extracts, was a possible allelochemicalthat caused inhibition in the germination of Triticum aestivum and Sinapis arvensis seeds.9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- was identified as an effective allelochemical that had asignificant allelopathic effect on weed suppression [42]. Tahir et al. [25] further reported that9,12-octadecadienoic acid was significantly correlated with the inhibition in the germinationof Triticum aestivum and Sinapis arvensis seeds. 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid (Z,Z,Z) wasextracted from Carduus nutans and n-hexadecanoic acid was extracted from Cirsium creticumand Carduus nutans and identified as some of the chemicals that had an allelopathic effecton the germination of Raphanus sativus, Lactuca sativa, and Lepidium sativum [43]. Accordingto studies conducted by Zhang et al. [44] and Yuan et al. [45], the identified n-hexadecanoicacid in the Solidago canadensis and Spartina alterniflora aqueous extracts had significantallelopathic effects on the growth of wheat and algae. Zhang et al. [44] also noted thatthe higher the n-hexadecanoic acid concentration, the greater the inhibitory effect on theshoot and root lengths of wheat. Verma et al. [42] identified 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid,methyl ester, and phytol from sunnhemp, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- from sesame andneophytadiene, and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z) from pearl millet, which were effectiveas allelochemicals when used in weed control. The presence of different allelochemicalsmay be responsible for the inhibitory effects of various extracts on the germination andseedling growth of the Microcystis aeruginosa blooms [41]. Several phenolic compoundspresent in A. ochroleuca are known to be biologically active, and they could also be potentialallelochemicals [25,42]. Since more than one compound with allelopathic potential wasdiscovered in this plant in the present study, it could be speculated that synergistic effectsof these potential allelochemicals could exist for this plant to exert its potential allelopathiceffects on other plants [46]. As allelopathic substances, these chemical compounds shouldbe further investigated as well as their effects on the germination of seeds. Some of thesechemical compounds have been identified and used in pharmaceutical studies and in thedevelopment of bioherbicides [47,48].5. ConclusionsThe current study details the allelopathic effects of the A. ochroleuca shoot and root wa-ter, hexane, and acetone extracts on the germination of maize seeds and the phytochemicalspresent in this plant. The allelopathic effects of the three distinct extracts on maize differedfrom one another. Additionally, the allelopathic effects varied between the two plant parts,with the shoot extracts having higher inhibitive effects than the root extracts. There wasa concentration-dependent response in maize seed germination, while A. ochroleuca athigher concentrations had drastic effects on germination, and lower concentrations hadAgronomy 2024, 14, 1912 11 of 13less of an effect. The presence of 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, (Z,Z,Z)-, n-hexadecanoicacid, octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, \u00e1-sitosterol, and other compounds in the extracts of A.ochroleuca could have allelopathic effects on seed germination, as shown in the presentstudy. The extracted phytochemicals might have phytotoxic effects on other weeds, whichcould be exploited and used alternatively as environmentally friendly herbicides. Argemoneochroleuca is an invasive alien weed with allelopathic effects on other plants. This weedreleases phytochemicals into the environment that inhibit the germination and growthof other crops in the vicinity, and it is for this reason that this weed should be controlledat an early stage before it affects the production of crops. This study was conducted in alaboratory, meaning that the controlled conditions may not entirely duplicate naturallyin field settings, thus resulting in variances in the germination rates. Furthermore, thechoice of solvent and analytical technique may result in insufficient extraction and charac-terization of the phytochemicals, reducing the comprehensiveness of the phytochemicalprofile. Future research should consider conducting similar studies in the field to betterunderstand the ecological relevance of the findings as well as using a broader range ofsolvents and other analytical techniques to provide a more comprehensive profile of theplant\u2019s phytochemicals.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, N.T.M., Z.P.D. and F.N.M.; Methodology, N.T.M., Z.P.D.,F.N.M. and H.N.; Validation, N.T.M., Z.P.D. and F.N.M.; Formal analysis, N.T.M., Z.P.D., F.N.M. andH.N.; Investigation, N.T.M., Z.P.D., F.N.M. and H.N.; Resources, N.T.M., Z.P.D. and F.N.M.; Datacuration, N.T.M., Z.P.D., F.N.M. and H.N.; Writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.T.M., Z.P.D. andF.N.M.; Writing\u2014review and editing, N.T.M., Z.P.D. and F.N.M.; Visualization N.T.M., Z.P.D. andF.N.M.; Supervision, Z.P.D. and F.N.M.; Sourcing funding, N.T.M. and Z.P.D.; Project administration,N.T.M., Z.P.D., F.N.M. and H.N.
