Keywords: Vernonia amygdalina, pharmacological activities, phytochemicals, traditional uses. 1. Introduction Recently, researchers have set out to uncover a new source of medicinal material that is generated naturally and has a less impact on human health, and the aquatic environment. Since organic herbal products are becoming increasingly popular as food supplements across the world, herbal plant-based approach is one of the choices accessible (Alara et al., 2019). Herbal medicinal practice makes use of phytochemicals found in plants; therefore, understanding and characterizing phytochemicals found in medicinal plants is critical for effective consumption and conservation (Alabi and Adeyemi, 2021). V. amygdalina is mostly cultivated and used in traditional medicinal practices in Africa and Asia's tropical areas (Oyeyemi et al., 2017). In the pharmacopeia, particularly in African origin, Vernonia amygdalina is one of the nutritionally and economically viable plants for its insect repellent and anti-tumor effects (Aregheore et al., 1998; Oyeyemi et al., 2017). 5 Vernonia amygdalina is an angiosperm belonging to the order, Asterales (Toyang and Verpoorte, 2013). The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, is grouped under the genus Vernonia, and species amygdalina. The genus is predominantly grown in the tropical regions and possesses several economic importance. The complete name of the plant is Vernonia amygdalina Del. (Toyang and Verpoorte, 2013). In Africa, V. amygdalina is the common name for this bitter-tasting plant (Abosi and Raseroka, 2003). The plant is predominantly cultivated in the tropical regions of Africa, especially in the West African (Tekou et al., 2018). In Igbo, Yoruba, and Hausa tribes of Nigeria, it is called as \u201cOlugbu\u201d, \u201cEwuro\u201d and \u201cFetefete\u201d respectively (Adesonoye et al., 2012). It is a soft woody shrub that grows perpetually to a height of 1 m to 6 m. (IfedibaluChukwu et al., 2020). This shrub grows perpetually to a height of about 6 m and can withstand a broad range of weather conditions (Tekou et al., 2018). It is commonly called \u201cbitter leaf\u201d due to its characteristic bitter taste and this may be attributed to its anti-nutritional contents (IfedibaluChukwu et al., 2020). A B 6 Fig. 1. V. amydalina L. plant parts. A. Leaves of V. amydalina showing its phyllotaxy, B. Leaves with stalk-sourced from bushes located at Nwabuko Cresecent, Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria. V. amygdalina leaves are 6 mm in diameter and 20 cm long (Habtamu and Melaku, 2018), it is dark green and is consumed in a wide variety of delicacies in African countries (Aregheore et al., 1998). V. amygdalina leaves are high in nutrients such as vitamins, fibre, carbs, and minerals, making them an important part of the human diet (Oyeyemi et al., 2018). Alara et al. reported some of the phytochemicals including alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, anthraquinone, edotides, xanthones, coumarins and sesquiterpenes have been identified in the plant. These bioactive compounds have been extracted and analyzed using various techniques such as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (Hasibuan et al., 2020), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) (Alara et al., 2019), soxhlet extraction (Tunasamy et al., 2019). Flavones extracted from flavonoids present in V. amygdalina include luteolin, luteolin 7-O-b-glucuronide, and luteolin7-O-b-glucoside (Alabi and Adeyemi, 2021). The pharmacological significance of V. amygdalina is due to the bioactive chemicals isolated from the plant leaves. Cold water extract of V. amygdalina has reportedly been used in the suppression of cancer (Yedjou et al., 2018), attenuation of dietary induced obesity (Atangwho et al., 2012), treatment of typhoid (Fadimu et al., 2014), inflammatory diseases (Asante et al., 2019), malaria (Okpe et al., 2016), kidney diseases (Atangwho et al., 2012), and gastrointestinal disorders (Akah and Ekekwe, 1995). They also possess analgesic activity (Njan et al., 2008), 7 neuroprotective effects (Oladele et al., 2020), hepatoprotective effects (Iwolakun et al., 2006), antioxidant activity (Erukainure et al., 2018), and anti-allergic activity (Ngatu et al., 2012). Fadimu et al. (2014) contended that extracts of V. amygdalina could be employed in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections. Fevers, coughs, constipation, and hypertension have been successfully treated with tonics derived from extracts of V. amygdalina (Amira and Okubadejo, 2007). Michael et al. (2010) also opined that V. amygdalina extracts could be utilised in the treatment of eczema and maintenance of healthy blood glucose levels. Although there is limited information as regards to the toxicity of V. amygdalina, Njan et al. reported on the toxicity of high dosage of extracts from the leaves. The aim of this review is to explore the pharmacological potentials of V. amygdalina and the extracted phytochemicals therein. This study will also provide relevant information on the beneficial effects of V. amygdalina as well as to incite further studies that may recommend the effectiveness and application of the extracts therein in the pharmacopeia and synthesis of new drugs. 2.

The title, abstract as well as the effect size of the searched articles were carefully read and reviewed whether they included relevant studies on the phytochemistry, ethnobotanical and pharmacological activities of V. amydalina. Only publications written in English were used in this review. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Ethnopharmacological uses of V. amygdalina L V. amygdalina has several medical, industrial, food, and traditional uses. The plant is used as a tonic in the treatment of fever, constipation, and many illnesses in traditional and herbal Nigerian medicine (Howard et al., 2016). These medicinal plant's herbal tonics are used in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. In general, the plant is cultivated to provide a significant source of edible vegetable. The plant is also used in the brewing industry as an alternative to hops in the production of beer. The Congolese maximizes V. amygdalina's medicinal potential by using it to treat cough and haemorrhoids (Ngatu et al., 2012). The leaves are frequently utilized in the treatment of malaria in Ethiopia. Several scientific studies have found that the herb has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties (Bihonegn et al., 2016). 3.2 Phytochemistry/bioactive compounds of Vernonia amygdalina L Alabi and Adeyemi uncovered several flavonoids (luteolin 7-O-b-glucuronide, luteolin 7-O-b-glucoside) in V. amygdalina ethanolic preparations. All three flavones have strong antioxidant 9 properties, particularly luteolin (3\u00b4,4\u00b4,5,7 tetrahydroxyflavone). Other phytochemicals present include alkaloids, anthraquinone, steroid, phenol, phytate, oxalate, cyanogenic glycoside, tannins and saponins. Hasibuan et al. used LC-MS/MS analysis to investigate the phytochemicals found in V. amygdalina. The findings revealed the presence of the following flavonoids: apigetrin, apigenin, luteolin, diosmetin, baicalin, rhoifolin, and scutellarin. Toyang and Verpoote examined the separated phytochemicals obtained from V. amygdalina extracts and showed that vernonioside A3, vernodalol, vernolepin, vernodalin, 11,13-dihydrovernodalin, and hydroxyvernolide are among the isolated bioactive chemicals and flavonoids. The reports of Adaramoye et al. showed that an increased content of flavonoids such as luteolin-7-O-glucoside in mice treated against liver toxicity might be connected to a reduction in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in irradiated animals pretreated with V. amygdalina extracts. Using LC-MS analysis, Erukainure et al. identified the phytochemicals found in V. amygdalina. The study revealed the presence of nicotinic acid, cumidine, and 3-methyl-isoquinoline. V. amygdalina alkaloids were discovered and described by Omojokun et al.. The extract of alkaloids was quantified using GC-MS. 1-Hexanamine, dimethylamine, 1-fluorononane, 1,3-cyclooctadiene, and hexadecanamide are examples of isolated alkaloid compounds. Iwolokun identified phytoconstituents with anti-plasmodial action from the extract and quinoline alkaloids such as cephantharin, cryptolepine, isocryptolepine, and neocryptolepine, as well as courmarins and terpenoids, are among these compounds. IfedibaluChukwu et al. isolated chemicals from V. amygdalina extracts ,including vernodalin, vernomygdin, vernoniosides A1, A2, A3, B1, vernoniosides A4, B2, B3, vernoniosides D and E, 10 vernodalol, epivern-odalol, phytol, and 4-methyl-vinyl butyrate, (z,z,z)-methyl ester-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid. Several chemicals were isolated from methanolic stem-bark preparations using a chromatographic method including glucuronolactone (CMP3), 10-geranilanyl-O-\u03b2-D-xyloside (CMP2), 11 \u03b1-hydroxyurs-5,12-dien-28-oic acid-3 \u03b1, 25-olide (CMP1), 1-heneicosenol O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (CMP4) and 6\u03b2,10\u03b2,14\u03b2-trimethylheptadecan-15 \u03b1-olyl-15-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-1,5 \u03b2-olide (CMP5) (Vernoniaolide glucoside) (Table 1). Hasibuan et al. (2020) used LC-MS/MS analysis to investigate the phytochemicals contained in V. amygdalina. The findings revealed the presence of diterpene (ingenol-3-angelate) and phenolics (chlorogenic acid and 4-methoxycinnamic acid), as well as coumarines (7-hydroxycoumarine, 4-methylumbelliferone, and 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide). Alara et al. (2019) used Soxhlet method and MAE to identify bioactive components from ethanolic extracts of V. amygdalina. The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis was used for further identification and confirmatory test was performed utilizing fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Among the isolated and described bioactives are 2-pentanol, pentanoic acid, 2-methyl-3-hexanol, and ethyl ester linoleic acid. 3.3 Pharmacological activities of Vernonia amygdalina L 3.3.1. Antidiarrhoeal activity Degu et al. investigated the antidiarrhoeal effects of V. amygdalina extracts against castor oil-induced diarrhoea in mice. Cold maceration with 80% methanol was used to separate V. amygdalina extracts. Only at the highest tested dose (400 mg/kg.bw) V. amygdalina showed a reduction in the beginning of diarrhoea, as well as a reduction in the frequency of stool and the 11 weight of faeces. V. amygdalina's inhibitory effects in this study highlight its antidiarrhoeal potential (Table 2). Shittu et al. evaluated the antidiarrheal activities of extracts of V. amygdalina against Vibrio cholerae induced diarrhoea mice. Single dose of 100 \u03bcL of V. cholera was inoculated into experimental rats. Administration of 250 mg/kg V. amygdalina demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory activity in tissues of experimental mice. The inhibitory effects of V. amygdalina indicated in this study emphasize its antidiarrhoeal activity. 3.3.2. Antioxidant activity The antioxidant activities of V. amygdalina have been reported by many researchers (Iwolakun et al., 2006; Tunasamy et al., 2019; IfedibaluChukwu et al., 2020). Iwolakun et al. investigated the anti-oxidative efficacy of V. amygdalina extracts against acetaminophen-induced in vivo toxicity in mice. Acetaminophen was injected at 300 mg/kg for 7 days. The pre-administration of the V. amygdalina extract at 50\u2013100 mg/kg reduced oxidative stress. IfedibaluChukwu et al. used 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging procedures in mice to investigate the anti-oxidative activities of isolates compounds from methanolic stem-bark extracts of V. amygdalina, they exhibited mild anti-oxidative action. Incubating brain tissues with V. amygdalina indicated a decrease 2-keto-glutaramic acid and cysteinyl-tyrosine metabolites in oxidative stress (Erukainure et al., 2018). Adesanoye et al. examined the chemoprotective properties of methanolic extracts of V. amygdalina (250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) against 2-acetylaminofluorene-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. by up-regulating the antioxidant enzymes. In another study, Ugbaja et al. reported the anti-oxidative activity of 12 flavonoid fractions of V. amygdalina in rats exposed to arsenic-induced oxidative stress. Erasto et al. investigated the antioxidative activity of acetone, methanol and water extracts of V. amygdalina. The antioxidative activity of the extract was determined by detecting the reduction of the absorbance of DPPH and ABTS radicals at 519 and 734 nm, respectively. Results showed methanol extracts with highest antioxidative activity compared to the acetone and water extract. Methanolic extracts have antioxidative activity by scavenging 75.9%, 93.9%, 97.1%, and 99.3% of the DPPH radicals from 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/ml of extracts. Acetone extracts scavenged radicals between 63.3% and 91.7%. Results from this study elucidated the antioxidative activity of V. amygdalina. Lolodi and Eriyamremu also examined the antioxidative activity of methanolic extract of V. amygdalina. The antioxidative activity of the extract was determined by treating rats with 200 mg/kg dose of V. amygdalina after induction with normal diet containing 5% Cycas revoluta (cycads). Results revealed that administration of extract induced an increase in MDA levels and reduction in SOD levels compared to the control group. Omojokun et al. revealed that extract of the plant (0\u201330.51 g/mL) inhibited arginase while the alkaloid from the extract reduced Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation (Table 2). 3.3.3. Antimicrobial activity Studies have reported the antimicrobial activities of V. amygdalina (Ngatu et al., 2012; Oyugi et al., 2015; Dumas et al., 2020). Dumas et al. showed that extracts of V. amygdalina exhibited inhibitory activity on all tested bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Degbe et al. reported its inhibitory effect on Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis. Chloroform extract of V. amygdalina showed 13 strong activity against S. aureus with an inhibition zone of 21 mm. Isorhamnetin and acetone extracts were active against all bacterial pathogens tested (Habtamu and Melaku, 2018). Yusoff et al. evaluated the antifungal activity of the leaf extracts against Botrytis cinereal. Water extract of the plant at concentration range of 100\u2013500 mg/mL, crude extracts of hexane, dichloromethane and methanol inhibited the fungus B. cinereal. However, the extract of V. amygdalina showed the most efficacies against the fungus. Extracts from dichloromethane at 400 and 500 mg/mL showed mid severity of infection. Chukwuemeka et al. showed that the extract inhibited S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa activities in mice. Ademola et al. examined the acetone extracts of V. amygdalina to determine its antiparasitic effects against the eggs and larvae of Haemonchus contortus. The extract inhibited hatching of eggs and larval development, also killing off H. contortus. Omoregie and Pal evaluated the antiplasmodial property of V. amygdalina against Plasmodium berghei induced in male Swiss rats. In vivo findings showed that the ethanolic extract of the plant suppressed the activity of P. berghei. Oral administration of 100 and 1000 mg/kg of the plant resulted in 23.7% and 82.3% inhibition of P. berghei respectively at day 4 (Table 2). 3.3.4. Immunological effect Momoh et al. studied the effect of V. amygdalina on CD4+ cell count of HIV-infected patients on ART-regime for a year. Different doses of V. amygdalina and an immune booster, immunace, were administered in human clients. Results revealed an increase in CD4+ cell count of infected patients. Im et al. assessed the immune-modulatory activity of V. amygdalina by determining its effect on the haematological and lipid parameters of Rattus norvegicus. Different doses 14 including 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of V. amygdalina were administered twice daily for 3 weeks. Results from this analysis revealed a concentration dependent increase in CD4+ cell count, however, a reduction was observed at highest dose (800 mg/kg). The extract also induced an increase in white blood cells and lymphocytes. 3.3.5. Anti-inflammatory activity Studies have shown the anti-inflammatory activities of V. amygdalina (Georgewill and Georgewill 2009; Nguyen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Nguyen et al. investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of cynaroside and novel vernonioside V, isolated from ethanolic extracts of leaves of V. amygdalina. The findings from their research showed that vernonioside V at concentration of 30 mg/mL strongly inhibited the activities of tumour necrosis \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) inflammatory cytokine production. These results indicated the anti-inflammatory potentials of V. amygdalina isolates. Liu et al. examined synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles from V. amygdalina for anti-inflammatory activity in mice (Liu et al., 2020). V. amygdalina reduced the inflammatory response and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in the mice. Asante et al. assessed extracts of young and old leaves of the extract to ascertain their ability to suppress inflammation, pain, and fever in carrageenan-induced inflammation model in rats. Ethanol extracts of V. amygdalina were administered at 50\u2013200 mg/kg, alongside diclofenac (10 mg/kg). The findings from the study showed a dose-dependent increase in anti-inflammatory properties observed in both ethanol extracts of young and old leaves extract, similar to the standard drugs, diclofenac. Onasanwo et al. reported that V. amygdalina possess anti-inflammatory effects through its ability in reducing inflammatory 15 leukocytes migration (Table 2). These reports justify the use of V. amygdalina extracts in the treatment of inflammation. 3.3.6. Anticancer activity Hasibuan et al. studied the anticancer effects of V. amygdalina leaves extracts on 4T1 breast cancer cells. V. amygdalina leaves induced apoptosis, increased cell accumulation in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and inhibited intracellular signals such as PI3K and mTOR expression in 4T1 breast cancer cells. Yedjou et al. investigated V. amygdalina extract's antiproliferative efficacy against human lung cancer (A-549) and human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. From their findings, the extract suppresses the proliferation of both A-549 and PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Yedjou et al. assessed the anticancer effects of the plant in MCF-7 cells. In the study, trypan blue exclusion test was utilized to distinguish between live and dead cells, and the propidium iodine (PI) assay with the cellometer vision was used for further analysis. Cell apoptosis was studied using flow cytometry. This study's findings revealed a reduction in cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. During the PI test, there was a steady rise in the number of necrotic cells (Table 2). Gresham et al. investigated V. amygdalina's anti-cancer efficacy in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast carcinomas. Different doses of V. amygdalina (10, 100, and 1000 g/mL) were given to BT-549 cells, resulting in cell growth inhibition of around 14%, 22%, and 50%, respectively. Howard et al. investigated V. amygdalina's chemotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC cells and stem 16 cell-derived tumors. The results of this experiment revealed a substantial reduction in tumor volume in MDA-MB-468 cells when compared to HRAS cells. V. amygdalina increased cell apoptosis which inhibits tumour development, justifying its chemoprotective effect (Howard et al., 2016). Wong et al. revealed that the extract of V. amygdalina was shown to inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 in a time- and dose-dependent manner through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Growth suppression in MCF-7 cells was supplemented by inducing cell-type specific G1/S phase cell cycle arrest. In the study, the ability of V. amygdalina to suppress growth was characterized by a decrease in certain signalling factors including cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, and an increased in p53 and p21 levels. The extract induced cell apoptosis, as evidenced by an increase in Annexin V-positive cells and the sub-G1 population. Other studies that reported the anticancer activities include Hasibuan et al. investigated the anticancer efficacy of the extracts against 4T1 breast cancer cells. Bestari et al. examined its anti-cancer activity against WiDr colon cancer cell line. The researchers showed that the ethyl acetate extract of V. amygdalina possesses strong cytotoxic potential having the lowest IC50 value (Bestari et al., 2017). Cameron et al. examined the anticancer activity of extracts of V. amygdalina against androgen independent prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3 cells). [3H] thymidine incorporation assays were used to determine DNA synthesis. Values obtained from the results showed an inhibition of DNA synthesis 12%, 45% (P < 0.05), and 73% (P < 0.01) upon administration of extract at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml doses. Extract resulted in a time-dependent activation of MAPK activity. Result showed more anti-cancer activity compared to Taxol 17 protective activity. These results showed the anticancer activity of V. amygdalina. Opata and Izevbigie examined the anticancer activity of V. amygdalina in MCF-7 cells. 0\u20131000 \u00b5g/ml of V. amygdalina was inoculated into the cells. Extract at (0, 30, and 100 \u00b5g/ml) of V. amygdalina inhibited [3H] thymidine uptake. Extract (1 and 10 \u00b5g/ml) inhibited cell growth by 40% and 54% under serum-free conditions. Chukwuemeka et al. investigated the anticancer efficacy of the plant\u2019s stem and leaves in mice, while Yedjou et al. investigated the extracts for anti-cancer efficacy against human breast cancer in vitro (Table 2). Wang et al. investigated the cytotoxic activity of isolated steroidal saponins from V. amygdalina, namely vernoniamyosides A\u2013D (1\u20134), vernoamyoside D (5), and vernonioside B2 (6). Vernoniamyoside A, vernoniamyoside B, and vernoniamyoside B2 were shown to be cytotoxic to BT-549 cell lines. Vernoniamyoside C, vernoniamyoside D, and vernoamyoside D exhibited varying degrees of cytotoxicity. The findings of this study provide a substantial basis for the use of V. amygdalina in anti-tumour research while also explaining its anti-cancer potential (Wang et al., 2018) (Table 2). Fachrunisa et al. investigated the cytotoxic activity, cell cycle inhibition, and apoptosis induction characteristics of V. amygdalina leaves' ethyl acetate extract on MCF-7 cancer cells. Treatment with ethyl acetate extract 1/2 IC50 and 1/5 IC50 resulted in cell cycle at 62.58% and 44.72%, respectively, compared to the cell control of 72.08%. These findings support V. amygdalina leaves' chemopreventive and anticancer properties. 3.3.7. Anti-diabetic activity Studies have reported the anti-diabetic activities of V. amygdalina (Ong et al., 2010; Asante et al., 2016; Erukainure et al., 2018; IfedibaluChukwu et al., 2020). Asante et al. evaluated the anti- 18 diabetic effects of young and old ethanolic leaf extracts of the resource plant against streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes in mice. IfedibaluChukwu et al. showed that isolated compounds from methanolic stem-bark extracts of V. amygdalina like 6\u03b2,10\u03b2,14\u03b2-trimethylheptadecan-15 \u03b1-olyl-15-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-1,5 \u03b2-olide had a significant reduction in the blood glucose in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Another study reported by Tekou et al. showed that oral administration of V. amygdalina for 4 weeks ameliorated type 2 diabetes in rats that were induced with STZ. Erukainure et al. revealed that hot water infusion of the leaves of V. amygdalina had inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase, reduced intestinal glucose absorption, and enhanced muscle glucose uptake. Ong et al. showed that the protective actions of the extract on \u03b2-cells resulted in a rise in insulin levels and the favourable regulation of the antioxidant system may be responsible to its anti-diabetic activity. V. amygdalina increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake by boosting GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane (Table 2). Michael et al. reported that the combination of V. amygdalina extract with metformin was potent against alloxan-induced diabetes in mice. Okon and Umoren investigated the antidiabetic activity of V. amygdalina against STZ (65 mg/kg) in type 1 diabetic rats. 52 mg/kg of V. amygdalina and 208 mg/kg of Ocimum gratissimum were administered orally for 28 days. Results revealed a hypoglycemic activity of V. amygdalina extracts. Owolabi et al. assessed the blood glucose lowering activity of V. amygdalina extracts against alloxan-induced diabetes in mice. Wu et al. assessed the antidiabetic effects of V. amygdalina against STZ-induced diabetes in mice. After 6 weeks of treatment with 50, 100, 150 mg/kg of V. amygdalina extracts revealed 19 a reduction in fasting blood glucose and also improved glucose and insulin resistance. Extract also induced an up-regulation in adenosine-5\u2019monophosph kinase enzymes and inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. From the results obtained it can be concluded that extracts of V. amygdalina has antidiabetic activity. 3.3.8. Hepatoprotective activity Iwolakun et al. investigated the in vivo hepatoprotective properties of V. amygdalina extracts against acetaminophen-induced liver damage in mice. Pretreatment with the extract at doses ranging from 50 to 100 mg/kg alleviated the induced acetaminophen changes in liver function parameters by 51.9% to 84.9% (Iwolakun et al., 2006). Adasanoye et al. studied the effects of methanolic extracts of V. amygdalina against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in male rats. Hepatic injury was induced by administering CCl4 orally at 1.2 g/kg 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Methanolic extracts of the plant were administered 5 times a week for 2 weeks prior CCl4 treatment at 250 and 500 mg/kg doses of extract. Administration of the extract elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes at 500 mg/kg concentration. Iwo et al. reported hepatoprotective effects of V. amygdalina extracts on intoxicated rats in combination with isoniazid and rifampicin (Table 2). Results from assessed serum albumin concentration and alanine amino transferase activity showed that the 100 mg/kg extract had hepatoprotective effect. Furthermore, the histological reports also revealed a minimal liver damage at 100 mg/kg. Barnes et al. examined the protective activity of V. amygdalina extracts against heavy metal induced toxicity in liver and kidney. After 21 days of the extract administration, there were 20 reduction in elevated levels of AST, ALT, and GGT, urea and creatinine. Adaramoye et al. investigated the hepatoprotective effects of V. amygdalina and Hibiscus sabdariffa, as well as vitamin C, against gamma radiation (4 Gy)-induced liver damage in rats. The mice were given a vitamin C dose of 250 mg/kg. Doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of V. amygdalina and Hisbiscus sabdariffa were given 4 weeks before and 5 weeks after radiation. The mice were sacrificed after 24 hours. At 24 hours, 800 mg/kg of V. amygdalina and vitamin C mixed extract resulted in an increase in blood alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity. At 800 mg/kg, V. amygdalina extract reduced blood conjugated bilirubin levels by 29%. The treatment resulted in a decrease in serum lipid peroxidation and an increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase levels. Vitamin C and V. amygdalina extracts at 400 and 800 mg/kg substantially reduced alkaline phosphatase and LPO levels. These findings also suggested hepatoprotective effect of the extract via anti-oxidative activities (Table 2). 3.3.9. Neuroprotective properties Oladele et al. investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of V. amygdalina methanolic leaf extract in rats with nitrobenzene-induced neurological disease. The findings revealed a rise in dopamine, glutathione, and antioxidant enzyme levels, as well as a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity, inflammatory and oxidative stress indicators. The findings of the study provide evidence for the therapeutic benefits of V. amygdalina methanol leaf extract on neurodegenerative diseases (Table 2). 3.3.10. Antimalarial activity 21 Abosi and Raseroka tested the extracts of V. amygdalina's leaves and root bark for antimalarial efficacy against drug-resistant P. berghei in mice. A standard inoculum of 1 x 107 infected erythrocytes was utilized, and leaf and root-bark extracts at doses of 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg were given for 4 days. The results indicated that leaf and root bark extracts had a suppression level by 67% and 53.5%, respectively (Table 2). The study's findings demonstrate that administering an ethanol extract of V. amygdalina during early infection can reduce parasitaemia. Bihonegn et al. tested the antimalarial activity of an 80% methanol extract and its solvent fractions of V. amygdalina leaves against P. berghei in mice. The extract produced a suppression of parasitaemia during a 4-day test in the following order 200mg/kg; 32.47% (\u00b12.65), 400mg/kg; 35.40% (\u00b13.14) and 600mg/kg; 37.67% (\u00b12.50). Okpe et al. discovered a rise in red blood cells and a recovery in packed cell volume in V. amygdalina treated groups in Plasmodium infected mice. Hepatic cells that had been injured by Plasmodium recovered after being given plant extracts. Challand and Willcox investigated the leaves of V. amygdalina for their efficacy in the treatment of unfinished malaria in patients aged 12 years and older. According to the findings of this study, 67% of patients had satisfactory clinical responses by day 14. Although 32% of these patients reported full parasite removal, 71% had recrudescence. Furthermore, no adverse effects were noted. Abey et al. investigated V. amygdalina's antimalarial efficacy against P. berghei in mice. Aqueous (Ver-H2O) and ethanolic (Ver-EtOH) leaf extracts were tested for their effectiveness against P. berghei sexual and asexual blood stages. The density of P. berghei was reduced by 50% due to Ver-H2O intake. P. berghei oocyst prevalence and density were decreased by 27% and 90%, respectively, when Ver-EtOH were administered. In vitro testing of 50 \u00b5g/mL Ver-EtOH revealed a high effectiveness in inhibiting 22 early sporogenic stage (ESS) formation (> 90%). Four fractions produced at this concentration from the ethylacetate phase of the methanol extract inhibited ESS (> 90%). These findings indicate that V. amygdalina includes its compounds have a strong antimalarial activity in Plasmodium stages. Yeshanew et al. examined the antimalarial activity of V. amygdalina in mice infected with 1\u00d7106 P. berghei parasitemia. Administration of extract began after 3 hours of inoculation with 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg of the extract administered orally for 4 consecutive days. Parasitemia levels observed in highest treatment group was low 17.94\u00b10.31 compared to the negative control group 46.53\u00b11.23. Iwolakun showed combination antimalarial effect of V. amygdalina extracts and chloroquine (5 mg/kg) in the range (57.2-72.7%). The extract also reduced parasitic clearance times. In contrast to chloroquine monotherapy, combination of chloroquine and V. amygdalina resulted in a higher cure rate in P. berghei-infected mice (66.7 \u2013 100 vs. 58.3%). These findings highlight V. amygdalina's antimalarial potential, demonstrating how extracts restore the effectiveness of chloroquine against P. berghei malaria in mice in a dose-dependent manner (Iwolakun, 2008). Masaba investigated the antimalarial effects of V. amygdalina on P. berghei obtained from a school kid and kept in liquid nitrogen in vitro. These experiments revealed that acetone-water and aqueous extracts of V. amygdalina have antimalarial activity, with the acetone-water extract being more effective (Table 2). These findings revealed V. amygdalina extracts' antimalarial activity. 3.3.11. Analgesic activity 23 Njan et al. investigated the antinociceptive effect of V. amygdalina extracts (acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin test, and tail-flick test) (Table 2). The extract inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing and the formalin test, according to the results of this test. 3.3.12. Cathartic effect Awe et al. investigated the cathartic effect of V. amygdalina using charcoal meal administered in mice. 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of V. amygdalina were administered to mice in different groups. Results revealed increased motility of charcoal meal and increased number of feaces. These results emphasized the purgative activity of V. amygdalina. 3.3.13. Anti-obesity activity Egedigwe et al. examined the anti-obesity activity of V. amygdalina in rats induced with high-fat diet. Rats were administered with 100 mg/kg.bw and 500 mg/kg.bw of aqueous extracts of V. amygdalina. Results showed a loss in weight of rats due to phytochemicals present in V. amygdalina, also reduction in insulin and leptin levels were observed in the extract treated groups. Atangwho et al. assessed the anti-obesity activity of V. amygdalina in diet induced obese rats. Extracts of V. amygdalina were administered at 5% and 15% supplemented with cafeteria-diet-fed to the treatment groups. Cafeteria-diet control group was administered 5.14 mg/kg of Orlistat. Results showed a reduction in body weight gain by 12.78% and 38.51% in treatment groups. Total body fat was reduced by 28.04% and 30.02% by 5% and 15% of V. amygdalina, respectively. Intake of 15% V. amygdalina induced a down regulation of serum triacylgycerol, serum and brain total cholesterol (Table 2). 24 4. Conclusion From the review, Vernonia amygdalina displays outstanding pharmaceutics and nutritional uses, making it a great functional component utilized in the treatment of a variety of health abnormalities. This plant may be a superior substitute for traditional medication in the treatment of microbial infections, cancer, diarrhoea, anaemia, and inflammatory disorders since it is a good source of essential phytochemicals, nutrients, and bioactive isolates with a higher biological value. V. amygdalina extracts improve health by boosting antioxidant activity and systems. Despite V. amygdalina's extensive pharmacological activity, additional human clinical studies are required to discover effective and safe dosages for the treatment of various diseases. Funding Nil.
