This plant has many food and medicinal uses. The use of its seeds and oil is common for treatment of many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory diseases, diabetes and digestive diseases. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive review on the scientific reports that have been published about N. sativa. The facts and statistics presented in this review article were gathered from the journals accessible in creditable databases such as Science Direct, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, EMBASE, SID and IranMedex. The keywords searched in Persian and English books on medicinal plants and traditional medicine, as well as the above reputable databases were \"Black seed\", \"Nigella sativa\", \u201ctherapeutic effect\u201d, and \u201cmedicinal plant\u201d. The results showed that N. sativa has many biological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, an- ti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and wound healing activities. It also has effects on reproductive, digestive, immune and central nervous systems, such as anticonvulsant and analgesic activities. In summary, it can be used as a valuable plant for production of new drugs for treatment of many diseases.

Medicinal herb is a plant that is able to change the physiological and pathological processes and can be used to prevent or treat diseases. In recent years, there is a significant increase in the use of medicinal plants, compared with the chemical drugs, due to several factors, such as easy access without prescrip- tion, low-cost, no need to refer to healthcare professionals, as [Received on]\uf020 17- Sep.-2015 [*Corresponding author] Tel: 03833330061; E-mail: biology_2011 @yahoo.com These authors have no conflict of interest to declare.

The world health organization has estimated that about 80% of people benefit from herbal remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the rich heritage of traditional medicines; however, only a few number of plant species have been thoroughly studied for the- rapeutic properties, mechanism of action, safety and toxicity; so many researches on medicinal plants are to be done. In Iran, medicinal plants have been frequently used in traditional medicine [1-5]; in addition, most of them have been investigated for treatment of different diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases [6], headache and migraine [7], fertility [8-9], diabetes [10], hyperlipi- demia [11-13], renal injury[14], stress and depression [15-16], pain [17], respiratory diseases [18], neurological disorders [19], liver disorders [20-21] and cancers [22-25]. Out of the medicinal plants, black seed (Nigella sativa), which is native to southwest Asia and has a rich historical and Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 733 \u2013 cultural heritage, due to a wide range of medicinal properties, is widely used in Iran [26-27]. N. sativa seeds have been used to promote health and fight diseases, especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asia [28]. N. sativa in South Asia is known as Kalonji, in Arabic as Habbat-uL-Sauda, and commonly referred as black cumin in English [29]. Botanical characteristics N. sativa belongs to Ranunculaceae family and is an an- nual herbaceous plant which mainly grows in various parts of southern Europe and some parts of Asia [30], including Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India [31]. Flowers are elegant predominantly white, yellow, pink, light blue or lavender and have 5\u221210 petals. The fruits of this plant are large and swollen capsule, which contain numerous black seeds with aromatic and bitter taste [26] (Fig. 1). N. sativa cultivation time is usually between November and April and germination lasts for about 10\u221215 days after sowing seeds. The flowering and fruiting times of the plant are generally from January to April [32]. Scientific classification of the plant Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyt Order: Ranunculales Family: Ranunculacea Genus: Nigella Species: sativa Fig. 1 Nigella sativa Chemical composition of N. sativa So far, several chemical compounds have been extracted and identified from different species of Nigella [33]. N. sativa contains 216 g protein, 406 g fat, 45 g ash, 84 g fiber, 249 g free nitrogen extract, 38 g moisture, 105 mg iron, 18 mg cop- per, 60 mg zinc, 527 mg phosphorus, 1 860 mg calcium, 15.4 mg thiamin, 57 mg niacin and 160 \u03bcg folic acid per kg [34]. Also, studies have shown the presence of different active pharmaceutical ingredients in the N. sativa seeds, in- cluding thymoquinone, thymol, limonene, carvacrol, p-cymene, alpha-pinene, 4-terpineol, longifolene, and t-anethole benzene [35-37]. Moreover, other phytochemical studies have revealed that the plant seeds contain two classes of alkaloids, including isoquinoline alkaloids such as nigellimine-N-oxide, and py- razole alkaloids such as nigellidine and nigellicine [38-40]. N. sativa seeds are also rich in unsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid [41]. Other compo- nents of the seeds include saponins, flavonoids, inda- zole-type alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, vitamins, and some important minerals like calcium, phosphorus and iron [42-43]. Some main constituents of N. sativa seeds with chemical structures are shown in Fig. 2. Use of N. sativa in traditional medicine Food and therapeutic uses of N. sativa oil (NSO) and seeds have a long history in Indian and Arabic culture. N. sativa has been traditionally used for treatment of various diseases (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, headaches, and dysentery) in Southeast Asia, Northern Africa and Middle East [44]. According to recent reports the grain\u2019s syrup was beneficial for digestion, appetite loss, amenorrhea, and dys- menorrheal and treatment of worms and skin rash [45]. Avicenna in his famous book, Canon of Medicine, has pointed out several black cumin properties, such as fatigue improvement and energy recovery. Islamic medicine also has enlisted health effects for this plant [46]. Pharmacological potentials Anti-microbial activity Experimental studies have reported that NSO and N. sa- tiva extracts have anti-microbial activity against a wide range of microbes, especially multiple-antibiotic resistant bacteria [47-48]. Anti-microbial effects of the plant extracts have been determined in Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and the pathogenic fungus Candida albi- cans [49]. It is found that anti-microbial properties of N. sativa are due to its active compounds such as thymohydroquinone and melanin [42]. Evaluation of in vitro anti- bacterial activity of NSO on pathogenic bacteria species consisting of three gram-positive, eleven gram-negative and C. albicans yeast has indicated strong sensitivity in all species [50]. Researchers have shown that N. sativa extract could effectively eradicate non-lethal staphylococcal infection in mice after subcutane- ous injection [49]. Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 734 \u2013 Fig. 2 Chemical structures of some main constituents of Nigella sativa seeds Experimental studies have revealed that N. sativa ex- tracts have synergistic effects on eradication of E. coli together with antibiotics such as gentamicin, streptomycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, nalidixic acid terbinafine, and cephalexin [49, 51]. Also, N. sativa has inhibi- tory effects on the growth of bacteria such as Yersinia ente- rocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium renale, Brucella abortus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, E. coli, Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes, and S. aureus [52]. Another study has shown that NSO has anti- staphylo- coccal effect comparable with antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cefamandol [53]. Moreover, N. sativa methanolic extract shows the strongest anti-fungal effect. It exhibits inhibitory effect against candidiasis in mice [54]. In a study antidermatophyte activity of N. sativa ether extract and thymoquinone (TQ) was examined against eight spe- cies of dermatophytes: four species of Trichophyton ru- brum and one each of Trichophyton interdigitale, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis [55]. In another study the anti-oxidant and an- ti-schistosomal activities of the garlic extract (GE) and NSO were considered. The results have demonstrated that, protec- tion with GE and NSO significantly ameliorate the an- ti-oxidant capacity of schistosomiasis mice compared to the infected- untreated ones and prevent most of the hematologi- cal and biochemical changes [56]. Also, Mahmoud et al. have studied the effects of NSO in liver damage induced by S. mansoni infection in mice. Infection with S. mansoni produces a pronounced elevation in the mouse serum activity of ALT, GGT, with a slight increase in AP level, while reducing serum albumin level and administration of NSO succeeds to correct the changes in ALT, GGT, AP activity, as well as the Alb con- tent in serum [57]. Anti-oxidant activity In several studies, anti-oxidant activity of N. sativa seeds has been reported. N. sativa could be a useful compound for preventing and treating cerebral ischemic and neurodegenerative diseases, due to its anti-oxidant property [58]. Co-administration of NSO with cisplatin in male rats im- proves oxidative stress induced by cisplatin in testicles [59]. Also in a study to determine the anti-oxidative properties of N. sativa, 64 healthy subjects received 3 g N. sativa daily for two weeks. The results indicated a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation after consumption, and therefore the anti-oxidant activity of N. sativa was confirmed in that study [60]. N. sativa extract consists of numerous anti-oxidant compounds, including TQ, carvacrol, t-anethole and 4-terpineol [61]. TQ with powerful anti-oxidant properties indirectly reduces the production of reactive oxygen species and causes the inhibition of lipid peroxidation [62-63]. NSO or TQ injection in ischemia phase causes reperfusion and im- proves the performance and level of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in rats [64]. TQ improves non- en- zymatic (GSH and vitamin C) and enzymatic activities (SOD, CAT, GPX, and GST) of anti-oxidants. It also reduces malon- dialdehyde (MDA) to normal in mouse brain [65]. In another research, TQ modulatory effects on erythrocyte lipid peroxida- Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 735 \u2013 tion and anti-oxidant status are elevated during 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-(DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis in male rats. Also, TQ pre-treatment improves increased level of MDA and conjugated diene levels to normal and reduced increment of enzyme activities like CAT, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD activities [66]. Moreover, treatment effects of TQ on arthritis in rats are determined by biochemical assays, demon- strating that TQ causes significant changes in all parameters (articular elastase, MPO, LPO, GSH, CAT, SOD and NO) [67]. Indeed, NSO and TQ inhibit lipid peroxidation in liposomes, via a non-enzymatic way [50]. Other compounds of NSO like quinone, carvacrol and 4-terpineol are wonderful in connecting free radicals to each other for neutralization [68]. These compounds have been eva- luated in many in vitro anti-oxidant tests. The results indicate that different combinations of N. sativa have synergistic ef- fects. The combination of N. sativa with iron prevents oxida- tion. In many diseases, such as cirrhosis or liver damage, N. sativa anti-oxidant activity could eliminate free radicals [69]. Also in a phytochemical research on hydroalcoholic extract of Khorasan N. sativa species, it has compounds such as tannin (3+), flavonoids (+) and alkaloids (2+) [70]. Among the flavo- noids, aglycones and flavonol glycosides are also present in the N. sativa. These flavonoids have higher anti-oxidant ef- fects and consequently a more anti-radical effect, so they act as a revealer of superoxide radicals in the blood to eliminate free radicals and inhibit the oxidation process in cells [71-72]. Anti-inflammatory activity In traditional medicine, fixed oil of N. sativa seed is widely used to treat skin rashes, back pain, rheumatism, and related inflammatory diseases. Studies have shown that fixed oil of black cumin seed and TQ exert their anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the production of these compounds [68, 73]. Eosinophils, oxidants, cytokine, and inflammatory ma- crophages and neutrophils are responsible for creating in- flammation condition in body [74]. It is found that administra- tion of aqueous extract of N. sativa or TQ in calcium iono- phore-stimulated neutrophils inhibits production of 5-lipooxigenase [73]. Anti-inflammatory effects of NSO and TQ have been shown in several inflammatory models of experimental ence- phalomyelitis, colitis, peritonitis, arthritis and edema, which mediate inhibition of inflammatory mediators, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes [75]. Also the anti-inflammatory effects of TQ and N. sativa extract on LPS-induced inflammation in the mix-glial cells and macrophages indicate a reduction in nitric oxide production by these cells [76], which is probably due to the inhibition of iNOS by TQ [77]. Moreover, anti-inflammatory potential of TQ in PDA cells is compared with trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). TQ considerably reduces syn- thesis of MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and Cox-2 in PDA cell dose- and time-dependently. TQ affects p21 WAF1 expression, inhibits HDAC activity and induces histone hyperacetylation, so TQ suppresses inflammation associated cancer, through HDAC inhibition [78]. TQ affects adenosine receptors, which suggests that some of its anti- inflammatory effects may be mediated by these receptors [79]. In another study, the antiasthmatic (bronchodilatory) effect of N. sativa extract in asthmatic patient airways was examined and the results showed that the extract caused significant increase in all pulmonary function tests [80]. Anti-hyperlipidemic activity N. sativa has significantly improved the lipid profiles in menopausal women [decreased total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglyceride (TG), and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c)] more than the placebo treatment within two-month intervention. One month after discontinuation of treatment, the lipid pro- files in the N. sativa-treated group have changed towards the pretreatment levels [81]. In another study, the effect of N. sati- va seeds has been evaluated on lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results have shown that patients ingested 2 g\u00b7d\u20131 N. sativa display a significant decline in TC, TG, and LDL-c, and a significant elevation in HDL-c/LDL-c, com- pared with their baseline data and control patients. But in- creasing N. sativa dose to 3 g\u00b7d\u20131 has failed to show any in- crease in the hypolipdemic effect produced by the 2 g\u00b7d\u20131 dose [82]. Amini et al. have studied the potential hypoli- pidemic effects of the NSO on healthy volunteers. Their re- sults have shown significant decreases in fasting blood cho- lesterol, LDL, triglyceride, glucose and HbA1C levels in NSO treated volunteers, as compared to placebo group at the end of the study [83]. Also Bano et al. have investigated the effects of aqueous extract of N. sativa seeds on body weight, food intake, and some biochemical parameters in rats. Their results show that N. sativa decreases body weight and food intake with no decrease in water intake. Blood glucose, serum cholesterol, TG and low density lipoproteins (LDL) are sig- nificantly decreased and HDL significantly increased [84]. Anti-cancer activity N. sativa seed, its essential oil and some of its active compounds, especially TQ and \u03b1-hederin, have been shown to exert significant anti-cancer effects on a variety of neoplasms [43]. For N. sativa anti-cancer effects, different mechanisms such as utilization of free radicals, effects on enzyme activity, inhi- bition of cell proliferation [85], changes in intracellular gluta- thione, anti-oxidant activity, trapping free radicals [59, 86] and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells through a pathway de- pendent and independent of p53 have been proposed [87]. Also for TQ anti-cancer mechanism, its effects on colon cancer cells are growth inhibition, morphological changes and in- creased apoptosis of cancer cells. TQ induces apoptosis by increasing the expression of the target gene mRNAs of P53 and p21WAF1 and inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-2) [88]. In a study, the methanol extract of N. sativa shows a strong cytotoxic action against Ehrlich ascites carci- noma cells and Dalton\u2019s ascitic lymphoma cells and a minim- Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 736 \u2013 al cytotoxicity to normal lymphocytes [89]. Cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of N. sativa ethanol extract on ACHN line of renal cancer cells in comparison to normal L929 cells have been reported [90]. N. sativa seed extract has potent anti-cancer effects on sarcoma and lymphoma-180 cells, with less toxicity on normal lymphocytes [91]. Also topical application of N. sativa extract inhibits early stages of skin cancer in mice [92]. Moreover, TQ anti-tumor and anti- angiogenic effects on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo have been investigated and the results demonstrate that TQ induces a higher percentage of growth inhibition and apoptosis in the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 and blocks constitution of human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube in a dose-dependent manner. It is observed that TQ significantly downregulates NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity, XIAP, survivin, and VEGF in SaOS-2 cells. Treatment with TQ upregulates cleaved caspase-3 and SMAC in SaOS-2 cells. TQ effectively inhibits tumor angi- ogenesis and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, inhibition of NF-\u03baB and downstream effector mole- cules is a possible mechanism of action for TQ\u2019s anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity in osteosarcoma [92]. The inhibitory ef- fects of TQ are reported in vitro and in vivo on benzopyrene induced stomach cervical cancer in rats [93]. Another study shows that induced fibrosarcoma can be inhibited by TQ in vitro and the mechanism for this effect is not clear, but may be related to interference with DNA synthesis, which is prob- ably related to glutathione reduction and storage, lipid perox- ides, and the activity of some enzymes [94-95]. Anti-diabetic activity N. sativa has been recommended by many traditional medicine experts to treat diabetes [96]. Significant effects of N. sativa on blood sugar reduction have been confirmed, which is probably due to the presence of essential oil [42]. It is thought that the anti-diabetic properties of N. sativa are induced by activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), affecting cellular uptake of proteins with hypoli- pidemic and anti-diabetic properties [97-98]. Oral administration of volatile oil of black cumin (2 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7BW\u22121) shows a significant reduction in blood glucose in Balb/c mice [44]. Intraperitoneal injection of NSO (50 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) caused con- siderable hypoglycemic effect in fasting normal rabbits and alloxan-diabetic rabbits. Because of no change in basal in- sulin levels in all groups, it appears that N. sativa reduces blood glucose by an insulin-independent mechanism [99]. N. sa- tiva extract show an insulin-sensitizing action by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, a major component of the insu- lin-independent AMPK signaling pathway, and by enhanc- ing muscle Glut4 content [100]. Moreover, N. sativa extract causes regeneration and rela- tive proliferation in beta cells and a decrement in free radicals production in streptozotocin-diabetic rats [101-102]. Treatment with N. sativa extract and oil and TQ, significantly decreases tissue MDA and serum glucose and increases serum insulin and tissue SOD levels in rats. These findings demonstrate that N. sativa and TQ could be clinically useful in the treat- ment of diabetes and in the protection of \u03b2-cells against oxid- ative stress [103]. In another research, N. sativa powder (mixed with edible food) and TQ (in drinking water) were given to rats for 25 days and hematologic parameters analysis demon- strated that TQ and N. sativa induced a significant decrease in blood sugar in normal rats [104]. N. sativa extract consumption for two months in rabbits causes a considerable reduction in blood gloucose and ceruloplasm and improves histological and biochemical signs of liver injury. These beneficial effects can be attributed to its anti-oxidant properties [105]. N. sativa regulates activity of glucose metabolism liver enzymes and thereby reduces gluconeogenesis. It inhibits the activity of glu- cose 6-phosphatase and fructose 1.6 bisphosphatase, which is involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, N. sativa increases the enzyme activity of glucose 6-phosphate, which is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway in cells [106-107]. Cardiovascular-protective activity In a study, the protective effect of N. sativa on the tho- racic aorta contractile response is evaluated in an experimen- tal model of diabetes mellitus in rat. The results show that treatment of diabetic rats with this plant causes maximum reduction in contractile response to non-specific KCL agonist and specific noradrenaline agonist. Probably long-term oral administration of N. sativa could reduce vascular contractile responsiveness and the number of cardiovascular complica- tions in diabetes [108]. In another study, the effect of N. sativa is studied on car- diac activity in diabetic rabbits and results show that N. sativa extract modulates irregular heart activity in diabetic rats [109]. The protective effects of TQ and acute (at 4 and 18 h) effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on cardiopulmonary para- meters in mice are investigated and the results indicate that TQ pretreatment causes systolic blood pressure reduction and prevents leukocytosis and IL-6 increment and decreases plasma SOD activity. It also inhibits reduction in platelet numbers and the prothrombotic events [110]. Moreover, the effects of NSO on homeostasis, cholesterol and blood glucose levels have been investigated in rats and the results demon- strate decreases in serum cholesterol, TG, glucose and in- creases in leukocytes,splatelets, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. N. sativa extract administered at a dose of 800 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 for 12 weeks improved cardiac tissue damage caused by ischemia- reperfusion which was probably due to the anti-oxidant prop- erties of N. sativa [111]. Injection of essential oil component at 4\u221232 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 in anesthetized rats caused reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by anticholinergics [112]. In another expe- riment, dichloromethane N. sativa extract (0.6 mL\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121) reduced mean blood pressure in sponta- neously hypertensive rats [113]. Gastro-protective activity In an experiment the anti-ulcer potential of N. sativa aqueous suspension is assessed on induced gastric ulcers and basal gastric secretion in rats and the results show that an Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 737 \u2013 aqueous suspension of N. sativa inhibits induced gastric ulcer formation. This extract also significantly ameliorates the ulcer severity and basal gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated Shay rats. The anti-ulcer effect of N. sativa is possibly be- cause of prostaglandin-mediated and through its an- ti-oxidant and anti-secretory activities [114]. It is also reported that N. sativa aqueous extract reduces indexes to 36% in aspi- rin-induced stomach ulcer in rats [115]. The use of NSO at a dose of 0/88 g\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7d\u22121 for two weeks increases mucin and glutathione levels in stomach and decreases the amount of histamine. The protective effects of hydroalcoholic extract on the gastric mucosa have been demonstrated [116]. In a study, TQ (doses of 50 and 100 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) and N. sativa are shown to have protective effects on gastric ulcer in Wistar rats, via their an- ti-oxidant effects, decreasing induced ischemia-reperfusion and gastric ulcer [117]. Moreover, TQ administration could prevent and improve colitis, which could be a therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [118]. Nephro-protective acivity A study has been carried out to show the possible benefi- cial effects of TQ in STZ-induced diabetic rats and to deter- mine the predictive value of mesenchymal and epithelial markers in the response of diabetic nephropathy to TQ. TQ shows protective effects on experimental diabetic nephropathy. Both mesenchymal and epithelial markers serve as excellent predictors of early kidney damage and indicators of TQ res- ponsiveness in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy [119]. NSO enhances the hepato-renal protection mechanism, reduces disease complications and delays its progression [120]. N. sati- va at different doses for five-week period shows no toxic effect on kidney function [121]. Moreover, another study was done to observe the nephro-protective effect of anti-oxidants, vitamin C and NSO. The results demonstrated that vitamin C and NSO both had nephro-protective effects. These two anti-oxidants, as combined, proved to have synergistic nephro-protective effects [122]. In another study, NSO (5.0 mL\u00b7kg\u22121) pretreatment signifi- cantly decreased plasma transaminase activities, hepatic MDA, and TG levels with amelioration in hepatic histopathological findings [123]. Hepatoprotective activity It has been reported that N. sativa (0.2 mL\u00b7kg\u22121) intrape- ritoneally relieves the detrimental effects of ischemia- reper- fusion injury on liver. N. sativa treatment protects the rat liver against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury [124]. TQ protec- tive role in the hepatotoxicity of Cd++ especially with regards to its protection against perturbation of non-enzymatic and enzymatic anti-oxidants has been investigated. Pre- treatment with TQ (10 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121) demonstrates a signifi- cant protection by decrease in protein oxidation and the dep- leted anti-oxidants rejuvenation of cellular fraction [125]. Another study was undertaken to explore and validate N. sativa fixed oil (NSFO) and essential oil (NSEO) in diabetes mellitus treatment and the results supported the traditional use of N. sativa and its derived products as a treatment for hyper- glycemia and associated abnormalities. In addition NSFO and NSEO considerably ameliorate free radicals and improve antioxidant capacity [126]. Moreover, the protective effects of NSO supplementation against aluminium chloride- induced oxidative liver and erythrocytes damage have been evaluated in rats. NSO reduces aluminium chloride-induced oxidative injury in the liver and erythrocytes of the rats [127]. In another study, pretreatment of mice with 12.5 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 TQ signifi- cantly reduces the elevated levels of serum enzymes as well as hepatic MDA content and significantly increased hepatic nonprotein sulfhydryl (-SH) [32]. Indeed N. sativa contributes to inhibition of the enzymes present in the neoglucogenesis pathway in the liver [128]. Neuro-protective activity Effects of NSO on the central nervous system have been sedating and weakening [60]. The TQ derived from N. sativa extract causes a reduction in neuronal degeneration [129]. Re- search has shown that TQ has an effective analgesic effect [130] and exerts these effects through stimulation of opioid receptors in the central nervous system [131]. In another study, administration of intracranial TQ blocked PTZ-induced sei- zures and probably mediated this effect by increasing the gabaergic system tone and opioid receptors [132]. It is reported that N. sativa (200\u2212400 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) causes loss of depression in the forced swim test and open field test in the LPS-induced depression model [30]. Abdul Zahir et al. have reported that NSO can protect mice in the tolerance and dependence caused by tramadol. NSO has therapeutic potential through blocking the overproduction of drug-induced nitric oxide and oxidative stress [133]. Immuno-protective activity Many studies have demonstrated the effect of N. sativa and TQ on the immune system [67, 134-135]. In one of these studies N. sativa products lead to a reduction in B cell-mediated im- munity in vitro [135]. Some other studies have indicated that \u03b1-linolenic acid, estearidonic acid and other compounds of the plant seed boost the immune response, particularly T lympho- cytes [136-137]. N. sativa increases the proportion of helper T cells to suppressor T cells and increases the activity of natural killer cells [134]. Additionally, this herb stimulates interleukin-3 secre- tion by T cells [138]. Moreover, the plant\u2019s positive stimulatory effect on macrophages has been reported. N. sativa (2 g) sup- plementation with immunotherapy for 30 days results in an increase in phagocytic activity of macrophages in comparison to immunotherapy alone [139]. A research has demonstrated that the use of NSO for six weeks, increases phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and increases the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes in diabetic rats [99]. In an experiment on mouse spleen cells, no effect of N. sativa on the immune system is reported; however, in the presence of mitogen, an unknown mechanism of immu- nological responses is observed [136]. In another study, N. sa- tiva shows modulatory effect on pro-inflammatory and an- ti-inflammatory cytokine secretion. N. sativa also modulates Th1/Th2, and partially inhibits the Th2 [140]. In another study, N. sativa effects on immuno-hematological indices are investi- Wesam Kooti, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2016, 14(10): 732\u2012745 \u2013 738 \u2013 gated on rainbow trout and the results indicate a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin levels in the treated group [141]. In a research, a group of medicinal plants including N. sativa are examined for their immunomodulatory effects in BALB/c mice. The results have confirmed the immunomodulatory activity of N. sativa, and it may have therapeutical implications in proph- ylactic treatment of opportunistic infections and supportive treatment in oncological cases [142]. Wound healing activity N. sativa seeds and oil have been found to promote wound healing in farm animals [143]. Moreover, ether extract of N. sati- va seed applied topically onto staphylococcal-infected skin in mice improves healing by reducing total and absolute differen- tial WBC counts, local infection and inflammation, bacterial expansion, and tissue impairment [144]. Durmus and Ceribasi have compared the effects of N. sativa and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream on healing of burn wounds in an animal model. Histopatological evaluations on the 4th, 9th and 14th days showed that burn healing was better in the N. sativa and SSD groups compared with the control group. Wound healing was significantly different among the groups at 4th, 9th, and 14th days [145]. In another study, the contracting ability of the wounds treated by NSO is similar to antibiotic (Baneocin). However, there is some retardation in wound treated with NSO. The clo- sure time of the wounds for both is similar to some extent [146]. The extract from N. sativa shows favorable enhancement of human gingival fibroblast proliferation with accelerated wound closure, despite its non-significant effect on collagen synthesis, compared to Melastoma malabathricum, Pluchea indica, and Piper sarmentosum extracts. In addition to the increased level of bFGF by up to 15% at 100 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 of N. sativa, a slightly better effect was observed on the expression of TGF-\u03b2. Thus, N. sativa shows promising wound healing properties, validating its traditional use for the healing of oral wounds [147]. Effects on reproductive system N. sativa seeds increase the weight of reproductive organs, sperm motility and count in cauda epidydimides and testicular ducts. Spermatogenesis is increased at primary and secondary spermatocyte. And there is an increase in number of female pregnant rats [148-149]. In another study to assess the effect of NSO on sperm parameters and testes in comparison with nico- tine in rats, nicotine reduced sperm motility and morphology of normal and live sperms and also affected the testes histology, while NSO increased sperm quality and exhibited better testes histological features [150]. The evaluation of the role of extract of N. sativa on fertility potential, pituitary-testicular axis hormones and testosterone in male rats showed that there was a significant difference in testes and epididymidis weight, sperm count, ESR, DSP, blood testosterone concentration, LH and fertility index in both the lower and higher dose groups, compared to the control group [151]. Main pharmacologic effects of N. sativa are summarized in Table 1. Potential mechanisms of action According to the literature, some potential mechanisms of the N. sativa effects are shown in Table 2.

Also, tox- icity of NSFO in mice and rats has been tested, through de- termination of LD50 values and examination of possible bio- chemical, hematological and histopathological changes. No changes are observed in the levels of key hepatic enzymes, including AST, ALT, and GGT and histopathological modifi- cations (heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas) in treated rats. However, the serum levels of cholesterol, TG, and glucose and the count of leukocytes and platelets are decreased sig- nificantly, compared to control values, while hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are increased significantly. The results show that the low toxicity of NSFO is confirmed by high LD50 values, key hepatic enzyme stability and organ integrity. Thus a wide margin of safety for therapeutic doses of NSFO exists, but the changes in hemoglobin metabolism and the fall in leukocyte and platelet counts must be taken into considera- tion [153]. Actually, large doses of NSO have toxic effects on the histological structure of the kidneys and to a lesser degree on the liver. Thus, NSO should be used in proper doses, and further studies are recommended [154]. Conclusion N. sativa has been considered worldwide as an important medicinal herb. Its use in pharmaceutical, food and ornamen- tal industries displays considerable commercial value. N. sativa and its compounds, particularly TQ, have various pharmacological effects on different body parts. Available reports show anti- inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti- diabetic, and anti-hypertensive activities of the plant. Also, its effects on digestive, immune, and central nervous system have been demonstrated in various studies. The plant composition and medicinal properties necessitate further research on other useful and unknown features, so it can be used as a plant-derived medicine to treat various dis- eases.
