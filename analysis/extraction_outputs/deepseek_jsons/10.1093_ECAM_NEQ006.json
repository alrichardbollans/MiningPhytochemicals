The rhizome of Atractylodes ovata De Candolle is rich in essential oils, which are usually removed by processing. In this study, anti-oxidative abilities of essential oils and aqueous extracts of A. ovata rhizome were explored, and the in\ufb02uence of processing on the anti-oxidative abilities was examined. Essential oils and aqueous extracts ofA. ovata were extracted by boiling water and steam distillation, respectively. Quality of these two A. ovata samples was controlled by HPLC and GC-MS system, and anti-oxidative abilitieswerethenevaluated.ResultsshowedthatsurfacecolorofA.ovataturnedtobrownandchemicalcomponentswerechanged by processing. Contents of both atractylon and atractylenolide II decreased in the essential oils,but onlythe contents ofatractylon decreased by processing. Atractylenolide III increased in both A. ovata samples. However, A. ovata essentialoils displayed stronger anti-oxidative abilities than aqueous extracts in DPPH-scavenging, TBH-induced lipid peroxidation and catalase activity assays. Moreover, the bioactivity of essential oils from raw A. ovata was stronger than oils from processed A. ovata. On the other hand, cytotoxicity of A. ovata essential oils was stronger than that of aqueous extracts, and was more sensitive on H9C2 cell than NIH- 3T3 and WI-38 cells. In contrast, stir-frying processing method increased cytotoxicity of essential oils, but the cytotoxicity was ameliorated when processed with assistantsubstances. The results suggested that phytochemical components and bioactivity of A. ovata were changed after processing and the essential oils from raw A. ovata showed better anti-oxidative and fewer cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects. 1.Introduction Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are widely used to prevent and treat human diseases. However, the pharmaco- logical functions of certain TCMs depend on free radical- scavenging activities [1]. Oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases. Uncontrolled free radicals can damage myocardial cells, oxidize low-density lipoproteins and eventually result in cardiovascular diseases [2, 3]. In addition, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) also induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in mice [4]. ROS are generated through various pathways, for example, pollutants, UV light and other mechanisms [5]. Atractylodes ovata De Candolle is classi\ufb01ed in TCMs as a tonic herb. Traditional applications of A. ovata were used to invigorate the stomach and spleen by eliminating dampness and to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Many pharmacological e\ufb00ectsoftheA.ovataaqueousextracts(ARE),includinganti- in\ufb02ammation, anti-tumor and immunoregulatory proper- ties have been reported [6\u20138]. In regard to its chemical con- stituents, about 0.3\u20139% essential oils were found in A. ovata, including hinesol, \u03b2-eudesmol, palmitic acid and linoleic acid [9\u201311]. In addition, atractylon (AT), atractylenolides II (AT-II) and III (AT-III) were the major sesquiterpenoids in the A. ovata essential oils (ARO). In our previous study, AT was reported to have strong anti-oxidative abilities [12]. As also previously described, pharmacological e\ufb00ects of ARE were well studied, but the anti-oxidative abilities of the ARO were not very clear. In TCMs, Chinese herbs are often processed before use. The chemical compositions, e\ufb03cacy and cytotoxicity of herbs were changed after processing. Di\ufb00erent processing2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine methods were employed for TCMs, for example, stir-frying, soaking and carbonizing. A. ovata was usually heated and extra essential oils were removed for detoxi\ufb01cation before use. Stir-frying with assistant substances (e.g., red soil or burnt clay) was the most popular processing method for A. ovata in TCM factories in Taiwan. Red soil and burnt clay are common assistant substances used in modern herbal processing. Red soil contains high concentrations of unhydrated iron oxides, aluminum oxide and heavy clay. Burnt clay is taken from the lining of kitchen stove [13]. Therefore, the anti-oxidative e\ufb00ects of ARE and ARO, as well as whether processing in\ufb02uences the anti-oxidative abilities and cytotoxicity of both samples were explored. In thisstudy, A.ovatawasprocessed bydi\ufb00erentmethods and the qualities of processed A. ovata were evaluated by colorimetric analysis. ARE and ARO were extracted by boiling water and steam distillation, respectively. The chemical compositions were analyzed by HPLC and GC- MS system. Cytotoxicity and anti-oxidative e\ufb00ects of raw and processed AREs and AROs were also measured by DPPH radical-scavenging, ESR-spin trapping, TBH-induced lipid peroxidation in heart tissue, catalase activity assays and MTT assay, respectively. Our experimental procedure is summarized in Figure 1. 2.Methods 2.1. Animals. Male Wistar rats weighing about 250 \u00b1 10g were purchased from the BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd. and kept on a 12:12-h day: night cycle. Animals were maintained in polycarbonate cages at 21 \u00b1 2\u25e6C and provided food and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures involving animals followed the ethical regulations of Taipei Medical University (Approval No. LAC-97-0122). 2.2. Quantitative Colorimetric Analysis of Processed A. ovata . The processing procedures of A. ovata were described in our previous study [13]. Processed samples were included raw materials, stir-frying without assistant substances for 5min, stir-frying with red soil for 5min, stir-frying with burnt clay for 5min and stir-frying without assistant substances for 30min. Color measurement of A. ovata was performed usingtheKonicaMinoltaColorMeter(ModelCR-10,Konica MinoltaSensing,Osaka,Japan). TheCR-10wascomposedof 8 mm diameter measuring area with a di\ufb00use illumination 8\u25e6 viewing and the color measurements of A. ovata were detected on the surface. Each kind of processed A. ovata was measured in triplicate. Results were presented as the CIE L\u2217a\u2217b\u2217 color system. L\u2217 values indicated white or dark samples.A reductioninwhiteness, as evidencedbyadecrease in L\u2217 values, indicates darker samples. The highest a\u2217 values and b\u2217 values expressed redness and yellowness, respectively. 2.3. Preparation and Quality Control of the A. ovata Aqueous Extracts. Di\ufb00erent A. ovata samples were immersed in puri\ufb01ed deionized water and boiled for at least 30 min until half of the original amount was left. Aqueous solutions were then \ufb01ltered, and vacuum freeze-dried. The above Raw A.ovata Processing methods 1. Stir-frying without assistant substances 2. Stir-frying with red soil 3.

Raw A. ovata was processed by di\ufb00erent methods, and AREs and AROswereextracted byboilingwaterandsteamdistillation,respec- tively. AREs and AROs were quality controlled by colorimetry, HPLC and GC-MS system and were used to evaluate the anti- oxidative abilities and cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects of A. ovata. preparative procedures were stipulated by the Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy of Department of Healthin Taiwan. AmountsofAT,AT-IIandAT-IIIwereanalyzedviaHPLC system. HPLC apparatuses were composed of a SCL-10Avp System Controller, an LC-10ATvp Liquid Chromatograph Pump, an SPD-M10A Diode Array Detector, a SIL-10Avp Auto Injector, a CTO-10A Column Oven, FCV-10Avp Flow- Channel Selection Valves (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and an ERC-3415 Degasser (ERC, Altegolfsheim, Regensburg, Germany). The stationary phase consisted of a Purospher STAR RP-18e reversed-phase column (5\u03bcm, 4mm i.d \u00d7 250mm, Merck) and an acetonitrile-water system was used as the mobile phase in the gradient mode as follows: acetonitrile: 0\u201310min, 40\u20135%; 10\u201320min, 45\u201355%; 20\u2013 30min, 55\u2013100% and 30\u201340min, 100\u201355%. The \ufb02ow rateEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 was 1mlmin\u22121, and the oven temperature was maintained at 40\u25e6C. We used UV wavelengths of 220nm to detect the amount of AT and 236nm to detect the amounts of AT-II and AT-III. 2.4. Preparation and Quality Control of the A. ovata Essential Oils. A. ovata was crumbled and passed through a no. 20 meshstandard sieve.Weweighed70gofpowdersamples and mixed them with 5 volumes puri\ufb01ed deionized water. Steam distillation of the essential oil was performed in a Clevenger- type apparatus for 7h according to the Pharmacopoeia of Traditional Medicine in Taiwan. The essential oils were stored in an anhydrous situation. Quality control of the essential oils was analyzed via HPLC and GC-MS system. The HPLC analysis procedure was modi\ufb01ed from our previous study [13]. Analytical instruments were the same as the previous described. The stationary phase consisted of a Purospher STAR RP-18e reversed-phase column (5\u03bcm, 4mmi.d\u00d7 250mm, Merck) and mobile phase was CH3CN- H2O (80 : 20, v/v) for AT and CH3CN-H2O (45 : 55, v/v) for AT-II and AT-III. All mobile phases were degassed by ultra- sonicationand \ufb01lteredthrougha 0.45-\u03bcmFPVericel(PVDF) membrane (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The \ufb02ow rate was 1mlmin\u22121 and the oven temperature was maintained at 40\u25e6C. We used UV wavelengths of 220nm to detect the amount of AT and 236nm to detect the amounts of AT-II and AT-III. The GC-MS system was composed of a gas chromato- graph GC-2010 equipped with gas chromatography mass spectrometer GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). A DB-5MS column (0.25mm i.d \u00d7 30m \u00d7 0.25\u03bcm\ufb01 l m , J&W Scienti\ufb01c, Folsom, CA, USA) was performed with Helium as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 73.0kPa. Injection temperature and ion source temperature were 150 and 200\u25e6C, respectively. The GC oven temperature was programmed to be maintained at 50\u25e6Cf o r5m i na n d then rise to 250\u25e6Ca t2 0 \u25e6Cm i n \u22121 for 10min. Results were obtained by collecting the scan mass spectra between the scan range 40 and 800amu. The mass spectra of the six major peaks in GC-MS chromatogram were compared with the database of NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library for identi\ufb01cation of possible components. 2.5. Anti-Oxidative Assay 2.5.1. DPPH Scavenging Assay. The assay protocol of 1,1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging activities was modi\ufb01ed from the previous study [14]. Test samples were dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted into di\ufb00erent concentrations. Each sample was mixed with the DPPH ethanolic solution (100\u03bcM) on a 96-well microplate at room temperature for 10min. Ascorbic acid was used as the positive control. DPPH level of each well was evaluated by detecting the optical density of each well at 530nm with ELISA spectrophotometer (\u03bcQuant, BioTek, USA). The DPPH scavenging rate (%) of each sample was calculated accordingthefollowing equation:[1 \u2212(Ss/EC)] \u00d7 100,where Ss and EC were the optical density value of the sample and control, respectively. 2.5.2. ESR-Spin Trapping Assay. A Bruker EMX electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) spectrometer was used to detect the ESR trapping and the experimental protocol was modi\ufb01ed from the previous report [15]. DPPH radical was used to generate the excess free radical. In sample prepa- ration, DPPH (500\u03bcM) and test samples were thoroughly mixed and reacted for 2min. ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature using a quartz \ufb02at cell designed for aqueoussolutions.DeadtimeofsamplepreparationandESR analysis was exactly 30s after the last addition. Conditions of ESR spectrometry were as follows: 20mW power at 9.78GHz, with a scan range of 100G and a receiver gain of 5 \u00d7 104. The modulation amplitude, sweep time, and time constant are given in the \ufb01gure captions. 2.5.3. Lipid Peroxidation Assay. Heart tissue was obtained from Wistar rats and homogenized in PBS. This homog- enized solution was centrifuged for 10min at 1200rpm. Protein level in the homogenized tissue was quanti\ufb01ed with Bioquant (Merck, Germany). The homogenized tissue was treated with125mMtert-butylhydroperoxide(TBH)with or without test samples and eventually reacted with thiobarbi- turic acid (TBA) to form the pink adducts, malondialdehyde (MDA). The optical density was measured at 530nm with \u03bcQuant spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). 2.5.4.Catalase ActivityAssay. Thecatalaseassay protocolwas modi\ufb01ed from the previous study [16\u201318]. A discontinuous method for measuring catalase used the ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange solution and detected at 560nm with \u03bcQuant spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). Catalase activity was represented in units of \u03bcmol min\u22121 ml\u22121. 2.6. Cytotoxicity Assay. The H9C2 (normal rat cardiomy- ocytes) and NIH-3T3 (normal mouse embryonic \ufb01broblast) cell lines were maintained in DMEM medium, supporting with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. WI-38 (normal human diploid cell line) cell line was maintained in MEM medium with 10% FBS. When con\ufb02uent, cells were washed with phosphate-bu\ufb00ered saline (PBS), trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in PBS, washed with fresh culture medium and transferred to 96- well plates (1 \u00d7 105 cells ml\u22121) for the cytotoxicity assays. Di\ufb00erent test samples were dissolved in DMSO at suitable concentrations and store at \u201320\u25e6C. Test samples were added to each cell line for 24h without renewal ofthe medium. The number of surviving cells was then counted using the MTT assay. Finally, the products were evaluated by measuring the optical density of each well at 600nm with \u03bcQuant spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). 2.7. Statistical Analysis. Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Signi\ufb01cance was calculated using Student\u2019st-test and one-way ANOVA test.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: Colorimetric values of the di\ufb00erently processed A. ovata samples.

Quality Control of Di\ufb00erent Processed A. ovata . After being processed by di\ufb00erent methods, CIE L\u2217a\u2217b\u2217 values of processed A. ovata were analyzed (Table 1). Raw A. ovata (A) expressed the highest L\u2217 values, indicating whitest color. Moreover, stir-frying with red soil for 5min (C) displayed the highest a\u2217 values (redness) and b\u2217 values (yellowness), due to the assistant substances, red soil. Finally, we collected 200 pieces of processed A. ovata for each group whose CIE L\u2217a\u2217b\u2217 values were nearly the same for following assays. First, theHPLC chromatogramofAT,AT-II andAT-III in AREswas shown inFigure 2(a)and their retention time were 35.5, 26.1 and 16.8min, respectively. Low concentrations of AT, AT-II and AT-III were found in AREs. Raw A. ovata had the highest AT concentration (0.071 \u00b1 0.003\u03bcgmg \u22121) among the di\ufb00erent AREs, but it was diminished by stir- frying. After processing, concentrations of AT-II and AT- III in the aqueous extracts from processed A. ovata were about 1.5\u20132.0-fold higher than those from the raw A. ovata (Table 2). Secondly, Figure 2(b) displayed the HPLC c h r o m a t o g r a m so fA Ti nA R O sa n di t sr e t e n t i o nt i m e was 12.5min. Besides, the HPLC chromatogram of AT-II and AT-III in AROs was shown in Figure 2(c) and their retention time were 14.5min and 32.1min, respectively. Concentrations of the three sesquiterpenoids in the AROs were higher than those in AREs. The highest AT concen- trations (266.70 \u00b1 3.63\u03bcgmg \u22121) were also found in raw ARO. AT and AT-II concentrations were also decreased by processing, but AT-III increased (Table 2)i nt h eA R O . Moreover, the GC-MS \ufb01ngerprint pro\ufb01le of raw ARO was shown in Figure 3(a). We chose six major components as standard peaks of the AROs. After comparing with the database, their retention time (min) and molecular weight (amu) were \u03b2-caryophyllene (10.6and 204), \u03b2-selinene (11.0 and 204), \u03b3-selinene (11.4 and 204), AT (12.3 and 216), AT-II (13.5 and 232) and stereoisomer of AT-II (15.2 and 232),respectively. Compositions ofthe processed AROswere totally di\ufb00erent due to the di\ufb00erent processing methods (Table 3). Likewise, concentrations of these six components in AROs were altered by the di\ufb00erent processing methods (Figure 3(b)). 0 50 100 150 200 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 AT-III AT-II AT (minutes) ( m a . u . ) (a) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 2.5 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 AT (minutes) ( m a . u . ) (b) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 AT-III AT-II (minutes) ( m a . u . ) (c) Figure 2: HPLC chromatograms of AT, AT-II and AT-III in AREs (a) and AT (b), AT-II and AT-III (c) in AROs. 3.2. DPPH-Scavenging E\ufb00ects of the A. ovataAqueousExtracts and Essential Oils. DPPH-radical scavenging activities were employed to evaluate the chemically anti-oxidative e\ufb00ects of di\ufb00erent AREs and AROs. Firstly, no signi\ufb01cant DPPH- scavenging abilities were found in AREs at 5mgml\u22121 (data notshown). However,asshown inTable 4,essentialoilsfrom raw A. ovata (A, 5mg ml\u22121) displayed the same DPPH- scavenging abilities as ascorbic acid (2.5mM) and with theEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 31 0 1 9 II I III IV V VI 1 5 . 1 8 2 1 4 . 9 5 7 1 3 . 9 0 9 1 2 . 9 2 3 1 2 . 6 9 9 1 2 . 5 0 9 1 2 . 1 6 8 1 1 . 6 0 8 1 1 . 3 4 1 1 1 . 4 5 0 1 1 . 0 1 9 1 0 . 4 7 1 0 . 5 7 2 1 0 . 8 3 5 1 0 . 3 5 1 9 . 9 3 6 4 . 9 8 9 1 1 . 0 8 1 (min) (a) I II III IV V VI 0 20 40 I II III IV V VI 0 20 40 I II III IV V VI 0 20 40 I II III IV V VI 0 20 40 I II III IV V VI 0 20 40 abc de (b) Figure 3: GC-MS \ufb01ngerprint pro\ufb01le of raw ARO.

On the other hand, the other samples expressed insigni\ufb01cant DPPH-scavenging e\ufb00ects, and the inhibitory e\ufb00ects were in the following order of essential oils from stir-frying with red soil for 5min (C, 47.08%), stir-frying with burnt clay for 5 min (D, 38.63%), stir-frying withoutassistant substancesfor5min(B,36.87%) and stir-frying without assistant substances for 30 min (E, 33.19%). According to the above results, AROs were evaluated in further anti-oxidative assays. 3.3. ESR-Spin Trapping Assay of the A. ovata Essential Oils. In the ESR-spin trapping assay, DPPH radical was used as the free radical generator. As shown in Figure 4,\ufb01 v em a j o r free radical signals were found in the DPPH group. All \ufb01ve di\ufb00erentAROs showed inhibitory activity against DPPH free radical generation compared to the DPPH group. Among them, raw ARO (A, 5mgml\u22121) displayed the strongest anti- oxidative e\ufb00ect. 3.4. Lipid Peroxidative Inhibitory E\ufb00ects and Catalase Activity of the A. ovata Essential Oils. According to many etiological studies, oxidative stress played an important role in causing many diseases, that is, in\ufb02ammation and malignant tumor. Thus, the e\ufb00ects of di\ufb00erent AROs on TBH-induced lipid peroxidation were evaluated.

In addition, all AROs exhibited increased catalase activity. Essential oils from raw A. ovata(A,500\u03bcgml \u22121)s ign i\ufb01 can tly displayed stronger catalase-increasing activity compared to the other AROs (Figure 5(b)). 3.5. Cytotoxicity E\ufb00ects of the Essential Oils and Aqueous Extracts from A. ovata . As shown in Table 5, the cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects of AT were stronger than those of AT-II and AT- III, and AT was more sensitive in the H9C2 cell line. In addition, cytotoxicity of AROs on H9C2 cell was also more sensitivethantheothercelllines.Firstly,AROsresultingfrom stir-frying without assistant substances for 5min (B) and for 30min (E) displayed stronger cytotoxicity on H9C2 cell line than did raw AROs. Once A. ovata was stir-fried with assistant substances, for example, red soil and burnt clay, cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects were ameliorated on H9C2 cell. On NIH- 3T3 and WI-38 cell lines, raw ARO showed less cytotoxicity than other AROs. However, none of the aqueous extracts from A. ovata showed cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects at 1000\u03bcgml \u22121 for 24h on these three normal cell lines. 4.Discussion Essential oils from herbspossessed di\ufb00erentbioactivities.

In addition, the vasorelaxive e\ufb00ect of Croton nepetaefolius and anti-fungal activities of Chenopodium ambrosioides were due to the essential oils [23, 24]. A. ovata was rich in essential oils, but few researches had examined the pharmacological functions of the A. ovata essential oils. Only in Zhang\u2019s study, essential oils from Atractylodes lancea had regulatory e\ufb00ects on delayed gastric emptying in stress-induced rats [25]. Pharmacologicalcharacteristics ofA.ovatawere warm, bitter and sweet and commonly used for tonifying and regulating Qi. Doctors usually used A. ovata to supple the spleen, boost the stomach, dry dampness and harmonize the center. A. ovata could be processed using di\ufb00erent methods to meet TBH H2O2 Free radical productions DPPH radical t-butyloxy radical Hydroxyl radical Catalase Raw ARO Raw ARO DNA strands breakage Lipid peorxidation Tissue damage Figure 6: Main e\ufb00ects of raw ARO on oxidative injuries. di\ufb00erent clinical needs. Raw A. ovata displayed stronger tonifying e\ufb00ectsthanprocessedA.ovataandwasusuallyused to treat appetite loss, indigestion and tiredness. However, processing enhanced the drying dampness e\ufb00ectsofA.ovata. Processing is an important part of preparing Chinese herbs. Characteristics of Chinese herbs are changed through di\ufb00erent processing methods. Concentrations of glucosino- lates, the active componentsofBrassica vegetables,decreased after being heated [26]. Variations in chemical composition after processing were correlated to alterations in cytotoxicity and e\ufb03cacy of Chinese herbs. In Li\u2019s study, processing reduced the acute diarrhea e\ufb00ects of Rheum palmatum due to a decrease in the anthraquinone contents [27]. However, maintaining an equal processing level was an important issue. Many reactions occurred during thermal processing of Chinese herbs, like the changes in \ufb02avor and color seen8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine after heat treatment. The browning reaction that caused the color changes of Chinese herbs was formed by variations of phytochemical components during heating, resulting in the plantcolorchanges[28].ProdelphinidinD3andprocyanidin B3, the phenolic compounds of barley grain, were easily auto-oxidized during heating and contributed to browning of the heated barley products [29]. Thus, we controlled the processed level through colorimetric values in this study (Table 1). The di\ufb00erent processing techniques changed the various AREs and AROs compositions. In our previous study, we described that AT, AT-II and AT-III were the major A. ovata components. Hence, the amounts of AT, AT- II and AT-III in raw and processed A. ovata were \ufb01rstly quanti\ufb01ed by HPLC analysis system. In addition, because of the evaporative tendency of the ARO sesquiterpenoids, we used GC-MS system to evaluate the ARO component variations after heat-processing. In the anti-oxidative assays, AROs displayed stronger DPPH-scavenging e\ufb00ects than AREs (Table 4). Our results showed that raw ARO displayed stronger anti-oxidative abilities than processed AROs in ESR-spin trapping, DPPH- scavenging, TBH-induced lipid peroxidation in heart tissue and catalase activity assays. Changes in the ARO chemical compositions were correlated with their respective anti- oxidative activities. AT was the most potent anti-oxidative components in ROS-induced lipid peroxidation [30]. In stir-frying processing, AT was converted to the non-anti- oxidative components, AT-II and AT-III, and the A. ovata essential oils had largely evaporated because of the heating. These phenomenons were possibly the reason that processed A. ovata lost its anti-oxidative abilities. Cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects of AROs and AREs on H9C2, NIH- 3T3 and WI-38 cells were also evaluated. The normal rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) cell line was chosen because of the TBH-induced heart lipid peroxidation assay. In addition, based on the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM, ISO 9001), NIH-3T3 and WI-38 cell lines were used to evaluate the alternative non- animal cytotoxicity tests [31]. As shown in Table 5,A T displayed the strongest cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects among the three sesquiterpenoids. In our previous study, we discussed the variations in chemical components and cytotoxicity between raw and processed A. ovata [13]. AT showed the strongest cytotoxicity on di\ufb00erent tumor cell line, but AT-II and AT- I I Id i dn o t .H o w e v e r ,c y t o t o x i c i t ye \ufb00ects of the essential oils from raw A. ovata which contained the greatest amounts of AT were not stronger than those from processed A. ovata on these three normal cell lines. We suggested that although AT was the stronger compound, amounts of AT in the essential oils of raw A. ovata (266.70 \u00b1 3.63 \u03bcgm g \u22121)w a si n s u \ufb03cient to cause cell death. In TCM, the general therapeutical rule of Qi-tonifying herbs was reported to promote blood circulation, activate vital energy circulation and to strengthen the body [32]. Previous study had shown that essential oil played an important role in promoting blood circulation and \ufb02ow [33, 34]. Accordingto Lou\u2019sstudy, circulatory function correlated to the anti-oxidative activities [35]. In this study, heat processing caused a large loss of A. ovata essential oils. We found that loss of essential oils resulted in a reduction of A. ovata anti-oxidative e\ufb00ects. Taken together, the cytotoxicity e\ufb00ects of A. ovata essential oils were slightly in\ufb02uenced by processing. On the other hand, processing resulted in a large loss oftheanti-oxidativeabilitiesoftheA.ovataessential oils. In conclusion, A. ovata was a potent anti-oxidative Chinese herb whose anti-oxidative e\ufb00ects were decreased by processing. As shown in Figure 6, we suggested that raw A. ovata essential oil was a more useful anti-oxidant for its tonifying e\ufb00ects than was processed A.ovata essential oil.
