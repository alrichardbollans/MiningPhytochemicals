Many of the technologies used in metabolomicshave method-specific advantages and drawbacks interms of diversity of metabolites detected, sensitivity, orresolution. In this paper, the potential of NMR spec-trometry applied to metabolomics is reviewed usingexamples of Nicotiana tabacum and Catharanthus roseusKeywords Metabolomics \u0002 Metabolic analysis \u0002NMR \u0002 Nicotiana tabacum \u0002 Catharanthus roseusIntroductionIn the past years, several genomes have been com-pletely sequenced and the genomes of more organismsare being sequenced. The number of fully sequencedorganisms will grow exponentially. This will open novelpossibilities of studying the functions of the genes inthese organisms. Functional genomics requires a thor-ough definition of the phenotype, to be able to deter-mine what changes result from up- or down-regulationof genes. A phenotype can be defined by morphologi-cal characteristics, by physiological measurements, aswell as by biochemical (transcriptomics or proteomics)and chemical (metabolomics) analysis. In recent years,more and more attention is being paid to the chemicalcharacterization of the phenotype. Chemical charac-terization can be done on the level of macromolecules(e.g., proteomics and characterization of polysaccha-rides and lignins) or low molecular weight compounds(the metabolome). The metabolome consists of twotypes of compounds, the primary metabolites and thesecondary metabolites. The primary metabolites arecompounds involved in the basic functions of the livingcell, such as respiration and biosynthesis of the aminoacids and other compounds needed for a living cell.Basically all organisms share the same type of primarymetabolites, though per class of organisms there maybe large differences in the biosynthetic pathwayspresent, e.g., mammalians lack amino acid biosynthe-sis, as they rely on external sources for their needs. Thesecondary metabolites are species specific, they play arole in the interaction of a cell with its environment,which can be other cells in the organism or externalorganisms, e.g., in case of plants to attract pollinators,or to defense itself against pests and diseases. So pri-mary metabolites in plants are important for thegrowth and agricultural yields, whereas the secondarymetabolites are, e.g., concerned with flavor and colorof our food and with the resistance of plants againstpests and diseases.Obviously in studying functions of genes metabolo-mics will be an important tool. Metabolomics isgenerally defined as both the qualitative and quanti-tative analysis of all metabolites in an organism. Inanalyzing a metabolome both the primary andsecondary metabolites will be detected. Plants sharethe primary metabolites, therefore methods that caneasily identify and quantify the primary metaboliteswith high reproducibility are required. One or moremethods are required that in all labs and at any timewill give the same results, which thus enables a publicR. Verpoorte (&) \u0002 Y. H. Choi \u0002 H. K.

Also for thesecondary metabolites such a database is needed,though in that case the occurrence of most compoundsis restricted to one or a few species only. The repro-ducibility is also required for studying the effect of anyexternal condition on the plant metabolome, as oneneeds to know the biological variation. That requireslarge numbers of analyses to determine the meta-bolomic changes as function of daily, seasonal, anddevelopmental variation. The results should functionas the control samples for all future analyses.Thus, reproducibility is the most important criteriafor developing a metabolomics technology platform.The other criteria concern the ease of quantitation andidentification, the number of metabolites that can bemeasured, and the time needed for an analysis,including the sample preparation. Obviously a high-throughput methodology is preferred, for whichrobotization is important. Based on the underlyingprinciple, the methods which one may consider for ametabolomic platform can be grouped as follows:- chromatographic methods (liquid chromatography,gas chromatography (GC), capillary electrophore-sis, thin layer chromatography);- mass spectrometry (MS);- nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.A combination of chromatography and one or bothof the other two methods also is an option. In Table 1,the various weak and strong points of these methodsare summarized. Concerning the mentioned criteria,chromatographic methods have a major problem inreproducibility. Although the intra- and inter-dayvariability may be reasonable, there is always aproblem of getting the same separation in another labdue to small changes in external conditions, chemicals,or solvents. Moreover, due to aging, column perfor-mance changes through time. Last but not least,commercial companies always come with improvedcolumns, which usually also means an altered selec-tivity of the system. A simple search in the literaturefor the separation of, e.g., tropane alkaloids shows thatevery year a number of new \u2018\u2018improved\u2019\u2019 separationsystems is described for these alkaloids. This is a poorbasis for a long-term reproducible database of resultsof such an analysis. MS also has a problem of repro-ducibility, mainly because in MS analysis the com-pounds have to be ionized before measuring. Thereexist many different types of mass spectrometers withdifferent ways to ionize the molecules, making com-parison difficult. Besides the variation of the hardwareand the conditions chosen, also a considerable matrixeffect exists for the efficiency of the ionization, whichmeans that a compound in different extracts may givedifferent quantitative results.NMR spectrometry is a physical measurement of theresonances of magnetic nuclei, such as 1H, 13C, or 15Nin a strong magnetic field. Each compound has a highlyspecific spectrum. The only variables are the solventused and the magnetic field strength. The solvent iseasy to standardize. The field strength is not a problemwith 13C NMR and even in case of 1H NMR it can beovercome (see below). The high reproducibility makesthat NMR among the three methods mentioned is themost suited for a public domain metabolomics data-base that may serve for many years to come.Concerning the criteria of quantitation, the chro-matographic methods have shown through the yearsto be very suitable for quantitative analysis. However,they always require calibration curves for the com-pounds that are quantified, as each compound willgive a different detector response. Only in GC incombination with a flame ionization detector (FID)one may compare peak intensities with each other,and thus make an estimation of the absolute quanti-ties of all compounds detected. UV-detection inHPLC, and MS in HPLC and GC will show totallydifferent sensitivities for each compound, some evennot being detected at all. For complex samples with anumber of compounds, it is not feasible to makecalibration curves for all compounds. That means onlya relative comparison for each compound in differentanalyses is possible, but no absolute quantitation canbe done, i.e., one cannot compare the amounts pres-ent of different compounds. This is a major disad-vantage, e.g., one cannot make any conclusion aboutthe conversion of one compound into another in caseTable 1 Description of chromatographic methods used in metabolomicsMethods Target metabolites Sample preparation Reproducibility Resolution DetectorTLC General Simple Low Low UV, MS, color reagentsGC Non-polar (lowmolecular)ElaboratederivatizationMedium High FID, TCD, NPD, MSHPLC Polar (chromophore) Elaborate Medium Medium UV, RI, MS, ELSD, fluorescence, NMRCE Ionic \u2013 Medium High UV, MS4 Phytochem Rev (2007) 6:3\u201314123of a decrease of one compound and an increase inanother related compound, i.e., conclusions aboutstoichiometry cannot be drawn from the data. Forqualitative analysis the hyphenated chromatographicmethods (HPLC with diode array detector, -MS, and/or NMR, GC\u2013MS) are the most powerful as theyoffer both retention behavior and physical character-istics as a tool for identification. MS allows thedetermination of the molecular weight, and in case ofhigh resolution also of the elemental composition, butthis is not always sufficient to determine the structure.Tandem MS might be of help to identify in such casethe compound through its fragmentation pattern, butin case of novel compounds further spectral data arerequired. The performance for NMR can be improvedby using two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods (seebelow), which even may enable structure elucidationof novel compounds in a mixture. In fact 13C NMRspectra were already used in the early 1980s for fin-gerprinting essential oils (Forma\u0301c\u030cek and Kubeczka1982). We described the use of 1H NMR spectra forthe fingerprinting of plant cell cultures (Schripsemaand Verpoorte 1991). It has been used ever since forthe analysis of sugars in cell cultures and media (e.g.,Kraemer et al. 1999, 2002; Schripsema and Verpoorte1991). Also other compounds have been analyzed inplant extracts by means of NMR, e.g., pyrrolizidinealkaloids (Pieters et al. 1989) and hop bitter agents(Hoek et al. 2001). With the increasing field strengthof the NMR-magnets and the improved resolutionthe application of NMR for metabolomics becamefeasible.Here we will first discuss the general approach tometabolomics and the sample preparation methodsand show some examples of the use of NMR-meta-bolomics in phytochemical studies. The weak pointsand possible solutions will be discussed.Sample preparationIn metabolomics studies there are three phases. The firstone is a qualitative phase in which as many as possible ofthe signals observed in the NMR are assigned to com-pounds. After this phase it is first necessary to determinethe biological variation for the system studied, thatmeans measuring a large number of samples, e.g., youngand old leaves, different times of the day, and differentstages of development of the plant. The last step is tocompare the model system under different experimentalconditions or compare, e.g., diseased or transgenicplants with the normal wild type plant. An importantaspect is of course the extraction method. Plants containa wide variety of compounds with totally differentpolarities. No single method is able to detect allmetabolites in a single operation. To extract as many aspossible we developed some years ago a two-phaseextraction method in which chloroform\u2013methanol\u2013water (2:1:1) was used. This procedure extracts bothpolar and polar compounds in the same operation. Thismethod gives good results, but is quite elaborate.Therefore, a series of single solvents were tested for theextraction of the metabolites from Arabidopsis(unpublished data, Fig. 1). By multivariate analysis, thespectra were compared in order to see which solventcovered the widest range of compounds. Methanol\u2013water (1:1) came out as the best one in terms of thediversity (Choi et al. 2006; Hendrawati et al. 2006;-20-1001020-70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7012345613245623456PC1 (68.7%)PC3 (6.1%)carbohydrates, amino acidsorganic acidsFlavonoids,phenylproapnoidsFig. 1 Score plot of PCA(PC1 vs PC3) based on 1HNMR spectra of the A.thaliana extracts. 1 Acetone, 2acetone\u2013MeOH (1:1), 3MeOH, 4 AcCN, 5 MeOH\u2013water (1:1), 6 water.

By using thesesolvents in deuterated form, extracts can be measureddirectly after extraction, without any need of evapora-tion and reconstitution of the extract. To avoid shifts dueto differences of pH (Schripsema et al. 1986) a bufferedsolvent (KH2PO4) is used (pH 6.0).Transgenic tobacco plants overexpression microbialgenes for salicylate biosynthesisWe have overexpressed the microbial genes encodingthe isochorismate pathway leading to salicylate (SA).The genes, isochorismate synthase from Escherichiacoli, and isochorismate lyase from Pseudomonas fluo-rescens, result in the constitutive production of SA intobacco plants. These plants have an increased resis-tance against viral and fungal infection (Verberne et al.2000). This raised the question if any secondary metab-olites pathways were altered, either due to the SA that isinvolved as signal compound in the systemic acquiredresistance (SAR), or due to channeling of chorismateaway from the other important chorismate pathwaysbranches, leading among others to phenylalanine (andfrom there to all phenylpropanoids) and tryptophan. In aseries of papers, various targeted approaches have beendescribed, which led to the conclusion that terpenoids(by GC-analysis, Nugroho et al. 2002a), and alkaloidsTable 2 Characteristic 1H chemical shifts of common metabolites in plants [CD3OD\u2013KH2PO4 in D2O (pH 6.0)]Metabolites Chemical shifts (ppm) and coupling constants (Hz)Alanine d 1.48 (H-3, d, J = 7.2 Hz)Ascorbic acid d 4.52 (H-4, d, J = 2.0 Hz)Caffeic acid d 7.52 (H-7, d, J = 15.9 Hz), d 7.12 (H-2\u00a2, d, J = 2.1 Hz), d 7.03 (H-6\u00a2, d, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), d 6.88 (H-5\u00a2, d,J = 8.4 Hz), d 6.29 (H-8\u00a2, d, J = 15.9 Hz)Chlorogenic acid d 7.60 (H-7\u00a2, d, J = 15.9 Hz), d 7.15 (H-2\u00a2, d, J = 2.1 Hz), d 7.05 (H-6\u00a2, d, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), d 6.87 (H-5\u00a2, d,J = 8.4 Hz), d 6.36 (H-8\u00a2, d, J = 15.9 Hz), d 5.33 (H-3, td, J = 10.0, 4.8 Hz), d 4.21 (H-5, br q, J = 3.1 Hz), d 3.80(H-4, dd, J = 9.9, 3.2 Hz), d 2.17 (H-2b, H-6b, m), d 2.04 (H-2a, H-6a, m)Citramalic acida d 2.80 (H-b, d, J = 15.7 Hz), d 2.61 (H-b\u00a2, d, J = 15.7 Hz)Citric acida d 2.74 (H-b, d, J = 17.6 Hz), d 2.56 (H- b\u00a2, d, J = 17.6 Hz)Fatty acids d 0.88 (H-x, t, J = 7.5 Hz)Ferulic acid d 7.56 (H-7\u00a2, d, J = 15.9 Hz), d 7.19 (H-2\u00a2, d, J = 2.1 Hz), d 7.10 (H-6\u00a2, d, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), d 6.88 (H-5\u00a2, d,J = 8.4 Hz), d 6.33 (H-8\u00a2, d, J = 15.9 Hz)Fumaric acid d 6.56 (s)a-Glucose d 5.20 (H-1, d, J = 3.8 Hz)b-Glucose d 4.59 (H-1, d, J = 7.9 Hz)GABA d 2.28 (H-2, d, J = 7.5 Hz), d 1.88 (H-3, q, J = 7.5 Hz), d 1.88 (H-4, t, J = 7.5 Hz)Glutamic acid d 2.07 (H-3, m), d 2.36 (H-4, m)Glutamine d 2.15 (H-3, m), d 2.47 (H-4m)p-Hydroxy benzoicacidd 7.91 (H-3, H-5, d, J = 8.8 Hz), d 6.92 (H-2, H-6, d, J = 8.8 Hz)Inositol d 4.00 (H-2, t, J = 2.8), d 3.61 (H-4 and 6, t, J = 9.9), d 3.44 (H-1 and 3, dd, J = 9.9, 2.9 Hz), d 3.24 (H-5, t,J = 9.3 Hz)Isocitric acida d 4.00 (H-a, d, J = 4.2 Hz), d 3.04 (H-b, td, J = 11.7, 4.2 Hz), d 2.56 (H-c, dd, J = 15.4, 7.3 Hz), d 2.56 (H-c\u00a2, dd,J = 15.4, 7.7 Hz)Kaempferol d 8.04 (H-2\u00a2 and H-6\u00a2, d, J = 8.6 Hz), d 6.74 (H-3\u00a2 and H-5\u00a2, d, J = 8.6 Hz), d 6.52 (H-8, d, J = 2.0 Hz), d 6.28 (H-6,d, J = 2.0 Hz)a-Linolenic acids d 0.96 (H-x, t, J = 7.5 Hz), d 1.30 (CH2 brs)Malic acida d 4.32 (H-a, dd, J = 6.6, 4.7 Hz), d 2.80 (H-b, dd, J = 16.6, 4.7 Hz), d 2.61 (H-b\u00a2, dd, J = 16.6, 6.6 Hz)Proline d 4.08 (H-2, dd, J = 8.6, 6.4 Hz), d 2.34 (H-3, m)Quercetin d 6.99 (H-5\u00a2, d, J = 8.6 Hz), d 6.52 (H-8, d, J = 1.8 Hz), d 6.28 (H-6, d, J = 1.8 Hz)Rhamnose inflavonoidd 1.10 (3-O-rhamnosylglucoside, H-6, d, J = 6.1 Hz)Sinapic acid d 7.48 (H-7, 16 Hz), d 6.93 (H-2, H-6, s), d 6.37 (H-8, 16 Hz)Steroids d 0.78 (H-18, s), d 0.85 (H-19, s), d 0.89 (H-21, d, J = 7.0 Hz)Succinic acida d 2.54 (s)Sucrose d 5.40 (H-1, d, J = 3.8 Hz), d 4.17 (H-1, d, J = 8.5 Hz)Threonine d 1.32 (H-5, d, J = 6.6 Hz)Tryptophan d 7.20 (H-5\u00a2, t, J = 7.4 Hz), d 7.29 (H-6\u00a2, t, J = 7.5 Hz), d 7.32 (H-2\u00a2, s), d 7.54 (H-7\u00a2, d, J = 8.1 Hz), d 7.73 (H-4\u00a2, d,J = 7.9 Hz)Tyrosine d 7.19 (H-2, H-6, t, J = 8.5 Hz), d 6.86 (H-3, H-5, t, J = 7.5 Hz)Valine d 1.00 (H-3a, d, J = 6.8 Hz), 1.05 (H-3b, d, J = 6.8 Hz)a Changeable by pH and concentration6 Phytochem Rev (2007) 6:3\u201314123(by HPLC-analysis, Nugroho et al. 2002b) were noteffected, whereas flavonoids (by HPLC-analysis,Nugroho et al. 2002c) showed lower levels, similarconclusions were drawn from a non-targeted approachusing centrifugal partitioning chromatography toprefractionate the extract followed by LC\u2013MS toanalyze the fractions (Halim et al. 2003). This was amajor effort as each of the different groups ofcompounds required the validation of a suited method.The next step was to use this model system for anNMR-based metabolomics approach, to learn how thisapproach compared with the elaborate targetedapproach.The first step was the qualitative analysis. Anumber of compounds could easily be identified. Tofacilitate the identification we started to build adatabase with NMR spectra of common plantmetabolites. This database contains now more than300 compounds, and more than 600 spectra (both 1Dand 2D spectra). Some of the very common diag-nostics signals are summarized in Table 2. Theyrepresent, e.g., phenolics, the anomeric protons ofsugars, amino acids, and organic acids. In each areaof the NMR, one may look for specific groups ofcompounds (Fig. 2).Using this method extensive studies have been madeof the metabolomes of the tobacco plants (Choi et al.2004a, 2006). We used the two-phase or deuteratedsolvent extraction method, and measured the NMRspectra. For analyzing the large data set of NMRspectra, multivariate analysis (using SIMCA-P, Umet-rics, Umea\u030a, Sweden) was used. From the results wewere able to clearly distinguish these in wild type andtransgenic plants. To introduce the NMR spectra intothe biostatistics program, they have to be processedinto digital quantifiable data. This is done by dividingthe spectra into buckets (or bins) of 8 or 16 Hz, peakheight in each bucket is integrated and introduced intoa text file used for further statistical analysis. Thisprocessing can be done by the NMR-software (e.g.,AMIX, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Ger-many). For robustness of the bucketing high repro-ducibility of chemical shift is required. By using abuffered NMR-solvent, the reproducible chemical shiftcan be obtained. However, there are still problem withorganic acids such as citric, citramalic, isocitric, malic,and succinic acid. The chemical shift of these signalsmay vary considerably depending on pH of the solu-tion. In order to solve the problem the region in whichthey occur can be bucketed by larger size (e.g., 40 Hz).However, one should always be aware of the risk that acompound may show changes in its NMR spectra, e.g.,due to complexity of the mixture, or due to concen-tration effects (Rhee et al. 2004). Table 3 shows theexample of the variation of chemical shifts of citric acidand malic acid in different concentration.The signals responsible for the separation found in thescore plot of principle component analysis (PCA) wereidentified from the loading plot (Fig. 3). Assigning thesesignals to various known tobacco constituents resulted inthe conclusion that the transgenic plants had lower levelsof flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, and sugars, and higherlevels of malic acid and alanine (Choi et al. 2004a). Thealkaloid and terpenoid levels were not changed. Similarconclusions as for the targeted approach (see above), butas extra information the increased levels of sugars andalanine were observed in this approach. This nicelyshowed the great potential of studying metabolic chan-ges in a single NMR-analysis.Phytoplasma infected Catharanthus roseusThe same approach as for tobacco was applied toCatharanthus roseus plants infected with differentPhenolicsAnomeric of sugarsAmino acids and sugarsOrganic acidsTerpenoids and steroidsFig. 2 Typical 1H spectra of Arabidopsis [400 MHz, CD3OD\u2013KH2PO4 in D2O (pH 6.0)] (adapted from Hendrawati et al.2006)Table 3 1H chemical shifts of H-b of citric and malic acids in different concentrations [CD3OD\u2013KH2PO4 in D2O (pH 6.0)]Concentration (mg/mL) Citric acid Malic acidH-b H-b\u00a2 H-b H-b\u00a21 d 2.73 (d, J = 15.0 Hz) d 2.62 (d, J = 15.0 Hz) d 2.68 (dd, J = 14.0, 3.3 Hz) d 2.37 (dd, J = 14.0, 10.0 Hz)5 d 2.89 (d, J = 15.0 Hz) d 2.77 (d, J = 15.0 Hz) d 2.84 (dd, J = 15.0, 5.0 Hz) d 2.67 (dd, J = 15.0, 7.0 Hz)10 d 2.87 (d, J = 13.3 Hz) d 2.74 (d, J = 13.3 Hz) d 2.85 (dd, J = 15.0, 5.0 Hz) d 2.72 (dd, J = 15.0, 7.0 Hz)Phytochem Rev (2007) 6:3\u201314 7123types of phytoplasmas (Choi et al. 2004b). Again aclear separation could be obtained for the plants,analysis of the markers for the differences led to theconclusions as shown in Fig. 4. Also, in this case, themacroscopic view on the metabolome via the NMR-analysis clearly showed major changes in the infectedplants. In this case, a considerable effort was made toidentify a number of compounds using 2D NMRspectrometry, this among others allowed the identifi-cation of the iridoids (see Fig. 5).Brassicaceae NMR-based metabolomicsFrom the results with the tobacco and C. roseus it be-came clear that biostatistical software (e.g., SIMCA-P)especially developed for metabolomics-like applica-tions might be an advantage. Also, we learned that ingeneral the two-phase extraction system was quiteelaborate and thus not the preferred one for a high-throughput systems. Moreover, the chloroform phasemostly only showed strong signals due to fatty acids,which can be quantified as group, but individual acidscannot be observed in the 1D NMR spectra. On theother hand, the methanol\u2013water phase gave an excel-lent overview of the plant\u2019s metabolome, and partic-ularly on a broad range of secondary metabolites. Adirect extraction with deuterated methanol\u2013water sol-vent thus seems to be most suited (unpublished data).For the identification of compounds further 2D NMRmethods were explored to identify compounds in thecrude extracts.

These matters were addressed in a seriesof experiments with tobacco, Brassica rapa andArabidopsis thaliana.One of the major problems of NMR-metabolomicsis the overlap of many signals, particularly in somecrowded regions. The use of 2D NMR spectrometrycan improve this considerably. In 2D J-resolved spec-tra, the second dimension gives for each signal thecoupling constant (Fig. 6a, Liang et al. 2006a). In thisway, the congestion is to a great extend solved.Moreover, the coupling constant is an excellent diag-nostic tool for the classification of signals as belongingto a certain class of compounds (e.g., cinnamic acidderivatives, Fig. 6a) (Liang et al. 2006a). Moreover, byprojecting the signals of 2D J-resolved spectra on theF2 axis (the chemical shift), each signal is reduced to asinglet, i.e., each proton is now observed as a singlet(Fig. 7). The spectra are comparable in appearance to13C NMR spectra. This simplifies the spectra enor-mously, as well as the identification of known com-pounds as the overlap of signals is much less. The mostimportant aspect of these projected 2D J-resolvedspectra is that all secondary effects are eliminated,consequently the spectra are independent of the fieldstrength (Choi et al. 2006). This makes them to excel-lent candidates for storage in a large database for long-term use in metabolomics. The disadvantage of thesespectra is that because of the projection the intensity ofthe signals of the different protons cannot be comparedanymore. For absolute quantitation, the intensities ofthe different peaks in the second dimension need to beadded.For the identification of compounds 2D NMRspectrometry methods are of great value. Signals canbe identified as well as their coupling with other pro-tons or carbons. Figure 6 shows part of the spectrum ofB. rapa in which from the 2D J-resolved spectrum itwas clear that the congested signals at d 6.3\u20136.5 weredue to cinnamic acid derivatives as they all have pro-tons with a large coupling constant (16 Hz, Liang et al.2006a). A single separation step of the extract wasmade to have an enriched phenolic compound fraction,and thus reduce the NMR time needed to run thevarious 2D NMR spectra. Further 2D NMR spectrawere used to elucidate their structures. From theCOSY and HMBC spectra, it can be learned thatmalic acid moiety attaches to carboxylic group ofFig. 6 Two-dimensional J-resolved NMR spectra of phenylprop-anoids of B. rapa leaves in the range of d 6.25\u20136.50 (a); d 5.32\u20135.42 (b). The spectra were measured in methanol-d4 (adaptedfrom Liang et al. 2006a)Fig. 7 1H NMR (a), 2D J-resolved (b), and projected 1D J-resolved (c) spectrum of healthy Nicotiana tabacum leaves in therange of d 6.25\u20136.50 (adapted from Choi et al. 2006)10 Phytochem Rev (2007) 6:3\u201314123phenylpropanoids. The presence of the attached H-2 ofmalic acid was confirmed by 2D J-resolved spectra(Fig. 6b). From the various 2D NMR experiments, awhole series of cinnamic acid derivatives was identifiedas shown in Fig. 8, both cis- and trans-isomers werefound (Liang et al. 2006a). Whether the cis-derivativesare artifacts or already formed in the plant remains tobe determined.Using the NMR-based metabolomics approach westudied the effects of a methyl jasmonate treatment ofB. rapa plants (Liang et al. 2006b). The score plot ofthe PCA (Fig. 9) shows a clear separation between thetreated and non-treated plants. From the loading plot,it can be concluded that the phenylpropanoids dis-cussed above increased in the treated plants, also anindole glucosinolate such as neoglucobrassicin and in-dole acetic acid increased in the treated plants.Virus infected tobaccoThe various tools we developed since our first tobaccoexperiments were applied on a study of tobacco mosaicvirus (TMV) infected tobacco plants. This system hasbeen studied extensively on the level of genes andproteins to clarify the SAR in plants. As already dis-cussed above SA does play an important role in SAR.Interestingly very little work has been done on the roleof secondary metabolism in SAR, as still the functionof several of the pathogen-related proteins is unknown,they might play a role in secondary metabolism. Wethus applied our NMR-metabolomics platform tech-nology on this system (Choi et al. 2006). In Fig. 10, thePCA score plot is shown. As expected the metabolomeof the leaf changes through time, similar changes areobserved in the infected leaves (mainly in PC1), but ontop of that in PC2 or PC3 clear differences betweenleaves from the infected and control plants can beobserved.By using the various 2D NMR methods, a number ofsignals that are clearly involved in the SAR responseand direct defense against the infection could beidentified (see above). In Fig. 11, the various changesare summarized. Apparently some of the effects occurin the infected leaves and SAR leaves, whereas othersonly in the SAR or the infected leaves. The meaning ofthe various changes need of course further study. Butobviously this systems biology type of approach usingNMR-based metabolomics, gives many novel leads forfurther study.NMR-based metabolomics platformThese various examples nicely show the greatpotential of NMR as a tool for having a macroscopicview on the plant metabolome. It is thus of greatinterest in functional genomics studies as well as insystems biology studies on all kind of biologicalprocesses. But such a platform has also many otherfields of application, such as quality control ofbotanicals and food (Choi et al. 2005; Kim et al.2005; Yang et al. 2006); phenotyping of plants forbreeders rights (Fernie et al. 2004; Fiehn et al. 2000;Fukusaki and Kobayashi 2005; Roessner et al. 2002);studies on the compounds related to pharmacologicalactivity in medicinal plants (Joshi et al. 2002);dereplication of plant extracts in bioprospectingOOHOHOOOR1HOR21'2'3'4'5'6'7'8'123 4R1 = OCH3, R2 = OH, trans-5-hydroxyferuloyl malateR1 = OH, R2 = H, trans-caffeoyl malateR1 = H, R2 = H, trans-coumaroyl malateR1 = OCH3, R2 = H, trans-5-hydroxyferuloyl malateR1 = OCH3, R2 = OCH3, trans-5-sinapoyl malateR1HOR21'2'3'4'5'6'7' 8'123 4OO OHOHOOR1 = OCH3, R2 = OH, cis-5-hydroxyferuloyl malateR1 = OH, R2 = H, cis-caffeoyl malateR1 = H, R2 = H, cis-coumaroyl malateR1 = OCH3, R2 = H, cis-5-hydroxyferuloyl malateR1 = OCH3, R2 = OCH3, cis-5-sinapoyl malateFig. 8 Chemical structures of phenylpropanoids identified in B.rapa leavesPhytochem Rev (2007) 6:3\u201314 11123screening programs (Nord et al. 2001); equivalence ofgenetically modified plants with non-GM plants(Fernie et al. 2004; Manetti et al. 2004; Notebornet al. 2000; Roessner et al. 2001, 2002).The great success of the NMR-based metabolomicstudies on urine for, e.g., diagnosis of diseases (Bollardet al. 2005; Kochhar et al. 2006; Lindon et al. 2003) andstudying toxicity of compounds in animal models(Gavaghan et al. 2000, 2002; Potts et al. 2001) can serveas a good example how plant metabolomics may fur-ther develop. Analyzing the much more complex me-tabolome of plants if compared with the various bodiesfluids such as urine and serum, will be a major chal-lenge for the coming years. Though the number ofcompounds that are detected in an extract is limited,still the NMR spectra give a good picture of what reallyis present. Minor compounds might not be seen, butthe major trends are clear. By combining the NMR-metabolomic data with a more targeted approach (LC\u2013MS, GC\u2013MS) for those compounds that seem to be ofinterest one would have the broadest possible infor-mation on the metabolome. It can be compared with amicroscope zooming in on smaller units. The NMRgives us the general overall view, the macroscopic view.Of course the question could be raised how manycompounds can be seen in NMR. The answer is many,but the number of compounds actually present in anextract is much smaller. In fact not all the commoncompounds we have in our database are detected in allplant extracts. By using both 1D and 2D NMR spec-trometry, one may say that about 50\u2013100 compoundscan be detected, and the absence (or below threshold)of another 50\u2013100 can also be concluded. For the fur-ther development of the NMR platform first of all adatabase with all common compounds is required.

In our experience, bufferedmethanol\u2013water (1:1) is an excellent solvent forstudying a broad range of primary and secondarymetabolites. This might be further completed by a non-polar solvent, though the compounds found in suchextracts are usually lipids and terpenoids. Lipids can beidentified as total groups, but not as individual com-pounds by means of 1D NMR. For terpenoids, thepossibilities for identification of individual compoundsare better.Our present database of more than 300 commoncompounds of plants showed to be very useful foridentification of compounds in the NMR spectra. Afurther computerized identification using the projected2D J-resolved spectra would be an importantimprovement.ReferencesBollard ME, Stanley EG, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK, Holmes E(2005) NMR-based metabonomic approaches for evaluatingphysiological influences on biofluid composition.
