This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons AttributionLicense, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properlycited.The dried ripe seed of Raphanus sativus L., commonly known as radish seed (or Raphani Semen), is used as traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) to treat constipation, chronic tracheitis, and hypertension. The major active compounds in Raphani Semen arealkaloids, glucosinolates, brassinosteroids, and flavonoids. Fatty acids are its main nutritional contents. Raphani Semen has beendemonstrated to have beneficial effects on hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, and cough. So far, there is noreport about the adverse/toxic effects of this herb on humans. However, Raphani Semen processed by roasting was reported toexhibit some adverse effects on mice. Additionally, erucic acid, the main fatty acid in Raphani Semen, was shown to enhance thetoxicity of doxorubicin. Thus, Raphani Semen has a potential risk of causing toxicity and drug interaction. In summary, RaphaniSemen is a valuable TCMherbwithmultiple pharmacological effects.More studies on Raphani Semen could help better understandits pharmacological mechanisms so as to provide clear scientific evidence to explain its traditional uses, to identify its therapeuticpotential on other diseases, and to understand its possible harmful effects.1. IntroductionRaphanus sativus L. belongs to the family Brassicaceae (Cru-ciferae, an older name). It is known as Radish in English,Daikon in Japanese, and \u201cLaifu\u201d or \u201cLuobo\u201d in Chinese.With its high adaptive ability, high yield, and abundantnutritional value, Raphanus sativus L. has long been grownas a food crop worldwide, especially in China, Japan, Korea,and Southeast Asia [1]. The leaf, seed, and root of Raphanussativus L. are claimed to have various medicinal uses [2],but only its dried ripe seed (Raphani Semen, Figure 1) islisted in Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic of China(CP) [3]. Raphani Semen is commonly used in traditionalChinese medicine (TCM) for promoting digestion, relievingdistention, directing \u201cQi\u201d downward, and dissipating phlegm.Traditionally, it is used to treat food dyspeptic retention, dis-tending pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, constipation,diarrhea and dysentery, panting, and cough with phlegmcongestion clinically in combination with other TCM herbs[3, 4]. For example, Raphani Semen is one of the threeimportant ingredients of San-Zi-Yang-Qin-Tang, which isa common TCM formula for relieving cough and asthma,dissipating phlegm, and promoting digestion [5].Raphani Semen is usually called \u201cLaifuzi\u201d or \u201cLuobozi\u201din Chinese. Its use in TCM can be traced back to \u223c900sA.D. in Ri-Hua-Zi-Zhu-Jia-Ben-Cao [3, 6]. The medical useof Raphanus sativus L. was even much earlier than that ofRaphani Semen. It was recorded in Ming-Yi-Bie-Lu in 3-4A.D [6]. Although the history of using Raphani Semen formedicinal purposes has more than a thousand years and it2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 1 cmFigure 1: The dried seeds of Raphanus sativus L.is one of the herbs documented in CP, there is no compre-hensive review on the phytochemistry and pharmacology ofRaphani Semen.With the advancement of analytical chemistry and phar-macology as well as the increase in the popularity of usingnatural products as an alternative medicine for treatingchronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer,research findings related to natural products expanded expo-nentially in recent decades [7\u201311]. This review summarizedthe recent scientific findings of Raphani Semen\u2019s phytochem-istry and pharmacological activities, such as antihypertensiveeffect and other beneficial effects on digestive and respiratorysystems, so as to provide a comprehensive overview of thisherb.2. Bioactive Chemical Constituents ofRaphani SemenRaphani Semen was found to have various classes of activecompounds [2, 12], for instance, alkaloids, glucosinolates,brassinosteroids, and flavonoids. In fact, most of these phy-tochemicals have been shown to have different bioactivities(Tables 1, 3, and 4).2.1. Alkaloids. The total alkaloid content (in terms of sinapinethiocyanate equivalent) of Raphani Semen was found torange from 1.056% to 2.620% (weight percent) [13]. Water-soluble alkaloids of Raphani Semen demonstrated to haveantihypertensive effects, which would be elucidated in thesection of pharmacological effects in this review. Sinapineis a natural phenolic amine commonly found in the seedsof brassica (or cruciferous) plants [14, 15]. Sinapine is themajor bioactive alkaloid [16], existing in the form of sinapinethiocyanate in Raphani Semen [17, 18]. In CP, the content ofsinapine thiocyanate is used for the quality control of RaphaniSemen. Previous studies have suggested that sinapine hadantidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory [19], radioprotective [20,21], neuroprotective [22], antioxidative [23], and antiagingeffects [24]. Additionally, sinapine was shown to have poten-tial in treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease by inhibiting the cerebralacetylcholinesterase activity [25, 26].2.2. Glucosinolates and Isothiocyanates. Apart from sinapine,another group of well-known secondary product found inbrassica plants is glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are stablecompounds found in plant tissues. They carry no specificfunction. Generally, they would be transformed to otherforms with higher bioactivity [69]. When intact cells ofbrassica plants are disrupted, glucosinolates are hydrolyzedby myrosinase or gut bacteria to form a series of products,such as isothiocyanate, thiocyanate, and nitriles [70, 71].In dried Raphani Semen, total glucosinolate content wasfound to be 73.504 \u00b1 0.980\ud835\udf07mol/g. Among the glucosi-nolates in Raphani Semen, the content of glucoraphenin(40.338 \u00b1 0.025 \ud835\udf07mol/g) is remarkably higher than gluco-raphanin (0.762 \u00b1 0.026\ud835\udf07mol/g) [72]. Glucoraphanin wasreported to be the modulator of hepatic cytochrome P450and phase II conjugation activities in an in vitro study [29].It may contribute to the chemopreventive activity of brassicavegetables.Isothiocyanates, which are one type of the principalproducts of glucosinolates, were reported to be able tosuppress tumour cell growth [73, 74]. Sulforaphane [27] andsulforaphene [42] are isothiocyanates derived from gluco-raphanin and glucoraphenin, respectively. The content ofsulforaphane and sulforaphene in Raphani Semen are 77.19\u201389.19 \ud835\udf07g/g [75] and 7mg/g [30], respectively. The hydrolysisof glucoraphanin to sulforaphane [27] is shown in Figure 2.Sulforaphene was first identified via the investigation ofantibacterial test with water extract of Raphani Semen [42]and later also found to possess growth inhibitory effect onhuman immortalized hepatocytes, to the similar extent as sul-foraphane [39].These two isothiocyanates were also found tohave potentials in other chemoprevention of various cancers[1, 28, 31, 33\u201335, 37, 38, 40, 41]. In particular, sulforaphanewas reported to be the potent inducer of phase II antioxidantenzymes [76, 77] implicated in carcinogen detoxification.Usingmolecular docking technique, sulforaphane was shownto bind to human serum albumins via nonpolar amino acidsso as to deliver sulforaphane derived from glucoraphaninto target tissues [78]. The interaction of sulforaphane withserum albumins may give hints to the mechanism of actionsof glucoraphanin or sulforaphane intake in cancer therapy.2.3. Brassinosteroids. Brassinosteroids represent a class ofsteroidal phytohormones showing high growth promot-ing activity in plants [79, 80]. Four kinds of brassinos-teroids isolated from Raphani Semen are teasterone, 28-homoteasterone, brassinolide, and castasterone [81, 82]. Arecent report provided the first evidence that natural brassi-nosteroids at micromolar concentrations could inhibit thegrowth of several human cancer cell lines without affectingthe growth of normal cells [43]. The study suggested thatcastasterone showed significant growth inhibitory effect ofsome cancer cells but brassinolide did not. However, teast-erone and castasterone represented biogenetic precursors ofEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3Table1:BioactivecompoundsofRaphaniSemen.ClassificationsCompoundsandtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeFunctions/PharmacologicaleffectsAlkaloidSinapineOHOOOON+C 16H24NO5+Antidiarrhealandanti-inflammatoryactivities[19]Radioprotectiveeffect[20,21]andneuroprotectiveeffect[22]Antioxidativefunction[23]Antiagingproperty[24]PotentialtotreatAlzheimer\u2019sdisease[25,26]GlucosinolatesGlucoraphaninOSNSHOHOOHOHOHO3SOC 12H23NO10S 3Precursorofsulforaphane[27,28]InvitromodulatorofhepaticcytochromeP450andphaseIIconjugationactivities[29]GlucorapheninOSNSHOHOOHOHOHO3SOC 12H21NO10S 3Precursorofsulforaphene[30]4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable1:Continued.ClassificationsCompoundsandtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeFunctions/PharmacologicaleffectsIsothiocyanatesSulforaphaneNS OCSC 6H11NOS 2Chemopreventiveeffectonhumancancercells(includingmammarycancercell[31,32],prostatecells[33,34],pancreaticcancercells[35],coloncancercells[36],T-cellleukemia[37],immortalizedlymphoblasticcells[38],andimmortalizedhepatocytes[39],aswellasmurinehepatomacells[40])Protectionagainstradiation-inducedskincarcinogenesisinmice[41]Neuroprotectiveandimmunomodulatoryeffects[28]SulforapheneNS OCSC 6H9NOS 2Antibacterial[42]activitiesAnti-humanimmortalizedhepatocytes[39]BrassinosteroidsCastasteroneHOOOHOHHOC 28H48O5Cytotoxictohumancancercelllines[43]Plantgrowthhormones[44]BrassinolideHOOHOHHOOOC 28H48O6Plantgrowthhormone[44,45]Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5Table1:Continued.ClassificationsCompoundsandtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeFunctions/PharmacologicaleffectsTeasteroneHOOOHOHC 28H48O4N/A28-HomoteasteroneHOOOHOHC 29H50O4Plantgrowthhormone[46]N/A;notapplicable.6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable 2: Nutritional ingredients identified in Raphani Semen.Classifications Nutritional ingredientsFatty acids[47\u201351]#Linolenic acid Erucic acid Oleic oil Eicosenoic acid Palmitic acidStearic acid Arachidic acid Behenic acid 15-Tetracosanoic acidTocopherolisomers [51]## \ud835\udefc-Tocopherol \ud835\udefd-Tocopherol \ud835\udefe-Tocopherol \ud835\udeff-TocopherolMinerals [51] Calcium(145 \u00b1 4.55 \ud835\udf07g/g)Magnesium(24.4 \u00b1 2.67 \ud835\udf07g/g)Iron(4.19 \u00b1 0.311 \ud835\udf07g/g)Zinc(1.94 \u00b1 0.418 \ud835\udf07g/g)Proteins Rs-AFP1 [52, 53] Rs-AFP2 [52, 54] RAP-1 [55] RAP-2 [55] 2S albumins [52]Polysaccharides(12.73%) [56] L-arabino-D-galactan [57]L-arabino-D-galactan-containing proteoglycan[57]#Details are shown in Table 3.##Details are shown in Table 4.brassinolide [81, 83]. It is essential to isolate these compoundsfrom the seeds to further identify their bioactivities.2.4. Flavonoids. The total flavonoids (in terms of rutincontent) in Raphani Semen were determined to be 0.60%[56]. Those flavonoids have been reported to have in vitroangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activitythrough binding to the Zn2+ ion located at the active site ofACE [84].3. Nutritional Contents in Raphani SemenRadish is an important food crop; thus there are studiesexamining the nutritional ingredients of Raphani Semen.Fatty acids are the major nutritional composition of interestsin Raphani Semen. Other nutritional components includeminerals, vitamin, proteins, and polysaccharides.3.1. Fatty Acids. Several studies have investigated the fattyacid composition in the oil of Raphani Semen [47\u201351].The yield of its oil extracted by Soxhlet extraction wasfound to about 35% of its dry weight. The extraction yieldcould be up to 42.64 \u00b1 1.36%, depending on the growingareas of Raphani Semen used. Many types of commonfatty acids, including linolenic acid, erucic acid, oleic oil,eicosenoic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid,behenic acid, and 15-tetracosenoic acid, were identified usinggas chromatography. Unsaturated fatty acids were found toaccount for over 80% of the total fatty acids. Linolenic acid,erucic acid, and oleic oil were the main fatty acids detected[47]. Oil of Raphani Semen was revealed to have significantantioxidative activity in the ferric reducing antioxidant powerassay [47]. Additionally, linolenic acid was found to attenuatethe formation of atherosclerotic plaques in rats fed with high-lipid diet through improving the antioxidation capacity ofthe body [59]. In a clinical trial, linolenic acid was revealedto be effective in improving the lipid profiles of 106 peo-ple with hyperlipidemia by taking soft capsules containingboth \ud835\udefc-linolenic acid and \ud835\udefe-linolenic acid [60]. Althoughthe development of cardiovascular disease is multifactorial,hypercholesterolemia is believed to play a crucial role in itspathogenesis and progression [85]. Raphani Semen, whichcontains high content of linolenic acid, may have effects onreducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.3.2.Minerals. Minerals, which are trace elements, are directlyinvolved in human metabolism. There is growing interest inthe role of certain minerals in physiological processes [86].Investigation on the mineral content in Raphani Semen isscarce. There was a study analyzing calcium, magnesium,zinc, and iron contents in the oil of Raphani Semen by usingInductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry[51]. Calcium was found to be the highest in content. Themineral contents of Raphani Semen are listed in Table 2.3.3. Tocopherol Isomers. Tocopherols are one type of vitaminE homologues. Raphani Semen contains \ud835\udefc-, \ud835\udefd-, \ud835\udefe-, and\ud835\udeff-tocopherols [51], among which \ud835\udefe-tocopherol content isthe highest (233 \u00b1 6.63 \ud835\udf07g/g). Their contents and chemicalstructures are shown in Table 4. Tocopherols are importantantioxidant compounds in oils. The oxidative stability ofRaphani Semen oil mostly relied on the presence of toco-pherols [67].3.4. Proteins. Four purified antifungal proteins and one classof antifungal albumins were distinguished from RaphaniSemen.They are Raphanus sativus antifungal proteins RAP-1,RAP-2 [55], Rs-AFP1 [52, 53], Rs-AFP2 [52, 54], and radish2S storage albumins [52]. All purified antifungal proteinsshowed an inhibitory effect against Botrytis cinerea in thelow ionic strength growth medium. On the other hand,RAP-1 exhibited stronger growth inhibitory activities againstyeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae thanRAP-2. Rs-AFP1 and Rs-AFP2 are composed of highly basic5 kDa polypeptides which are assembled in an oligomericquaternary configuration with a high degree of specificity tofilamentous fungi. The antifungal activity of Rs-AFP2 (IC50values = 0.4\u201325\ud835\udf07g/mL) is much more potent than Rs-AFP1(IC50values = 0.3\u2013100 \ud835\udf07g/mL). Radish 2S storage albuminsconsist of at least five isoforms. They have significant growthinhibitory effect on various plant pathogenic fungi and somebacteria when assayed in the low ionic strength medium.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7Table3:ConstituentsoffattyacidsinRaphaniSemen.Majorfattyacids(chemicalnames)andtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeContents(%/g,driedseeds)[47\u201351]PharmacologicaleffectsErucicacid(cis-13-docosenoicacid)OHOC 22H42O210.20\u201313.27N/AOleicacid(cis-9-octadecenoicacid)OHOC 18H34O27.62\u20131.22Anticancereffectviatargetingattelomeraseinhibitor[58]Linoleicacid\ud835\udefc-Linolenicacid(9,12,15-octadecatrienoicacid) OHO\ud835\udefe-Linolenicacid(6,9,12-octadecatrienoicacid)OHOC 18H32O23.30\u20135.17Effectiveonatherosclerosisinducedbycholesterol-richdiet[59],Controlblood-lipidlevelsofpatientswithhyperlipidemia[60]Eicosenoicacid\u2217OOHC 20H38O23.08\u20133.99N/APalmiticacid(hexadecanoicacid)OOHC 16H32O21.86\u20132.24N/A8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable3:Continued.Majorfattyacids(chemicalnames)andtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeContents(%/g,driedseeds)[47\u201351]PharmacologicaleffectsStearicacid(octadecanoicacid)OHOC 18H36O20.65\u20130.97Loweringlow-densitylipoproteincholesterollevel[61]Nervonicacid(cis-15-tetracosanoicacid)OOHC 24H46O20.45\u20130.74Servingasadietarytherapyindemyelinatingdiseases[62],Preventiveeffectsonobesity-relatedmetabolicdisorders[63]Myristicacid(tetradecanoicacid)OHOC 14H28O2TracePreventionoftestosterone-inducedprostatichyperplasiainrats[64]Arachidicacid(eicosanoicacid)OOHC 20H40O2TraceN/AEicosadienoicacid(11,14-eicosadienoicacid)OOHC 20H36O2TraceN/AEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9Table3:Continued.Majorfattyacids(chemicalnames)andtheirchemicalstructuresMolecularformulaeContents(%/g,driedseeds)[47\u201351]PharmacologicaleffectsBehenicacid(docosanoicacid)OOHC 22H44O2TraceN/ALignocericacid(tetracosanoicacid)OHOC 24H48O2TraceActivationofNADPHoxidaseinhumandermalfibroblasts[65]Palmitoleicacid(cis-9-hexadecenoicacid)OOHC 16H30O2TraceReductionofinsulinresistanceandhepaticlipidaccumulationbychronicadministration[66]\u2217Oneoftherepresentativestructuresofthechemical.N/A;notapplicable.10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable 4: Constituents of tocopherol isomers identified in Raphani Semen [51].Tocopherol isomers and their chemical structures MolecularformulaeContents(\ud835\udf07g/g, dried seeds)Functions/Pharmacologicaleffects\ud835\udefc-TocopherolOHOC29H50O2 12.22 \u00b1 0.10Antioxidation [51, 67]Reduction of the effect ofcadmium in the liver andbrain of Wistar rats [68]\ud835\udefd-TocopherolOHOC28H48O2 5.29 \u00b1 0.31 Antioxidation [51, 67]\ud835\udefe-TocopherolHOO C28H48O2 232.67 \u00b1 6.63 Antioxidation [51, 67]\ud835\udeff-TocopherolHOO C27H46O2 5.29 \u00b1 0.05 Antioxidation [51, 67]OSNSHOHOOHOHOSOSH NSOC SOOHHOHOOHOHHO3SOGlucoraphaninMyrosinase orgut microbacteriaGlucoseH2ONOSO3\u2212HSO4\u2212SulforaphaneFigure 2: The hydrolysis process of sulforaphane from glucoraphanin by myrosinase or gut microbacteria.4. Pharmacological Activities of RaphaniSemenThe extracts from Raphani Semen in different solventswere studied extensively. The pharmacological functions ofRaphani Semen include antihypertensive effect, antilipaseactivity, improvement of the pathologic insulin resistancestate, gastrointestinal effect, treatment of constipation, andantitussive therapeutic effect.4.1. Antihypertensive Effect. The increase in blood pressurecould raise the risks of myocardial infarction, heart failure,stroke, end-stage renal disease, peripheral vascular disease,and mortality from all causes [87]. In randomized clinicaltrials, antihypertensive therapy has also resulted in reduc-tions in the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, andheart failure [88]. Thus, the development of treatment ofhypertension attracted lots of research studies.The antihyper-tensive effect of Raphani Semen has been investigated in bothpreclinical and clinical settings in the past two decades.The renin-angiotensin system is a hormone system thatregulates blood pressure and water fluid balance, but it alsoparticipates in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction,diabetic nephropathy, and congestive heart failure. ACE isone of the key therapeutic targets for the regulation ofthese pathophysiological developments. The ethanol extractEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11of Raphani Semen was found to possess both in vitro ACEinhibitory and antioxidant activities. Thus, it could be usedto treat hypertension, prevent or slow down the progressionof cardiovascular and any free radical-related disorders. Thepresence of high phenolic and flavonoid contents in RaphaniSemen extract would be a major contributor towards ACEinhibition through binding to Zn2+ at the active site of ACE[84]. Further in vivo studies on the effects of Raphani Semenon the renin-angiotensin system could give more insights onits anti-hypertensive effects.The bioactive fractions, such as octenal, dibutyl phthalate,sinapine bisulfate, water-soluble alkaloids, and n-butanolextract, were found to have remarkable effects on loweringblood pressure [89, 90]. Systolic blood pressure of spon-taneously hypertensive rats (SHR) measured by tail-cuffmethod decreased after treating the animals with high dosageof n-butanol extract of Raphani Semen [89]. The pharma-cological mechanism of Raphani Semen\u2019s blood pressurelowering effect may be brought about by its vasodilationfunction to reduce the vascular resistance in the bloodvessels [91]. Raphani Semen water extract exhibited bloodpressure and heart rate reductions by mediating an atropine-sensitive pathway after being administrated to anaesthetizednormotensive rat intravenously [92]. Such extract could alsodose-dependently inhibit both atrial contractile force andrate of contraction in guinea-pig-isolated atria, where theinhibitory effect observed was found to be mediated throughactivation of muscarinic receptors [92].Water-soluble alkaloids from Raphani Semen weredemonstrated to have prominent hypotensive function bysignificantly enhancing serum nitric oxide (NO) content andcardiac nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in SHR [90].Through decreasing serum malondialdehyde content andenhancing superoxide dismutase activity in vivo, RaphaniSemen alkaloids are believed to have good cardiovascu-lar protective effects from oxidative damage. In addition,choline, a metabolite from the degradation of sinapine inRaphani Semen extract in the digestive system,might activatethe NO-NOS system [90], thereby increasing the synthesisof NO and resulting in vasodilation [9]. However, whetherthe anti-hypertensive effect of water-soluble alkaloids fromRaphani Semen resulted from the increase in NO availabilityby directly enhancing NO production (stimulation of NOSactivity), by indirectly reducingNOdegradation (antioxidantproperties), or by both pathways was currently unknown andwarranted further investigations.Raphani Semen has been used clinically in China. Aproprietary drug called Qingxuanjianyia tablet is sold inChinamainly containing concentrated Raphani Semen waterextract in which sinapine is the key bioactive compound. It isused to treat hypertension. In a clinical trial, 160 hypertensivepatients were randomly divided into four groups and orallyadministrated with Qingxuanjianyia tablets, nifedipine, cap-topril, or atenolol for 30 days [93]. The results indicatedthat intake of Qingxuanjianyia tablets could lower 82.5% ofpatients\u2019 blood pressure and ranked the third among the fourtested medicines. There was no significant change on theheart rate as well as obvious side effects [93]. Another studywith the same tablet compared to nifedipine showed similarresults and suggested thatQingxuanjianyia tablet was suitableto mild and moderate hypertensive patients [94].4.2. Antilipase Activity. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase is oneof the potential approaches for the treatment of obesity. Pan-creatic lipase is the main lipid-digesting enzyme to removefatty acids from the \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefc\udba0\udc20 positions of dietary triglyceridesto yield their lipolytic products and \ud835\udefd-monoglyceride aswell as long-chain saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids[95]. The methanol extracts of Raphani Semen and 36 otherChinese medicinal herbs were tested for their effects oninhibiting porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL, type II) in vitro.Although Raphani Semen demonstrated a relatively weakinhibitory activity against PPL as compared with other herbssuch as the dried fruit-spike of Prunella vulgaris L. and therhizome of Rheum palmatum L. [96], it could significantlysuppress the activity of pancreatic lipase in vivo. Additionally,Raphani Semen carries fatty acids (linolenic acid [59, 60],stearic acid [61], nervonic acid [62], and palmitoleic acid[66]) which have been shown to have beneficial effect onobesity-related disorders. Therefore, Raphani Semen mighthave antiobesity effect.4.3. Improvement of Insulin Resistance. Patients with type2 diabetes mellitus tend to develop hypertension, which isa major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortalityin this group of patients [97]. Although the exact mech-anisms underlying this propensity remain to be clarified,insulin resistance, dysfunction, and structural abnormalitiesin microvascular system together with renal damage mayplay crucial roles in the disease progression [98]. RaphaniSemen is used to remove phlegm turbidity by TCM practi-tioners. According to TCM theory, higher phlegm turbidityis believed to be related to increased blood viscosity [99].In fact, increased blood viscosity is one of the inducers ofinsulin resistance since it could affect the normal bindingcapacities of the insulin receptors in vascular system. Aresearch found that intragastric administration of RaphaniSemen extract to Sprague-Dawley rats with hypertension andinsulin resistance could increase the insulin-binding affinityto its receptors on hepatocytes [99]. Therefore, RaphaniSemen may be effective in improving the pathologic insulinresistance state.4.4. Gastrointestinal Effect. Gastrointestinal (GI) neuromus-cular diseases consist of multiple groups of chronic con-ditions associated with impaired gut motility. Since GIdisorders (varying in etiopathogenic mechanisms, patho-logic lesions, and regions of GI tract involved) are verycommon and are considered as one of the major socialand economic burdens, they represent a relevant matter forpublic health [100]. Using natural products to relieve GIdisorders becomes a new approach to handle these problems.It was reported that Raphani Semen water extract couldenhance the contractility of smooth muscles from guinea-pig ileum [101]. Another study showed that Raphani Semenwater extract exhibits significant in vitroGI prokinetic effects12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinein the rabbit jejunum and ileum, rat stomach fundus, andileum as well as the guinea-pig jejunum [102]. Additionally,Raphani Semen water extract was demonstrated to exhibitin vivo laxative effects in mice [102]. Interestingly, differentprocessing methods on Raphani Semen could affect thestrength of gastric emptying effect on Kunming mice. It wasfound that roasted Raphani Semen elicited less inhibitoryeffect on the gastric emptying as compared with the dried(no roasting) one [103]. Mice treated with roasted RaphaniSemen had \u223c57% gastric residue, while mice treated withdried Raphani Semen had \u223c70% gastric residue [103]. Incontrast, overroasted Raphani Semen could cause stomachswelling as its gastric residue content was up to 80% (thehighest among the three Raphani Semen extract-treatedmice) [103]. Comparing to the movement of GI smoothmuscle in Kunming mice, ileum smooth muscles of rabbitsfed with roasted Raphani Semen extract were much morereactive. Concerning the small intestine propulsive effect,there was no significant difference between the three RaphaniSemen extract-treated mice. It could be deduced that fooddigestion could be enhanced better by the roasted RaphaniSemen as it had the ability to retain food in the stomachlonger via moderate inhibition of the gastric emptying.4.5. Treatment of Constipation. Mice\u2019s intake of RaphaniSemen oil in 2.4 g/kg/day, which was equivalent to theamount for human\u2019s dosage in TCM, could increase defeca-tion rate (in terms of the number andmean weight of formedfecal pellets excreted) [104]. Additionally, same dosage ofRaphani Semen water extract could shorten the defecationlatency of constipation and increase the defecation rate [104].It suggested that both Raphani Semen oil and its water extractcould be effective in treating constipation.4.6. Antitussive Effect. Water extract of Raphani Semen wasshown to have cough inhibitory activity on Kunming mice.The antitussive therapeutic effect of the dried Raphani Semen(without roasting) was found to be much longer lasting thanthose of roasted and overroasted samples, while there wasno significant difference in the phlegm-eliminating actionsamong various groups [105].5. ToxicologyAlthough many positive effects of Raphani Semen weredetermined, different processingmethods (dried, roasted andoverroasted) on Raphani Semen may give different levelsof toxicity. A study on the effect of processing methods onRaphani Semen\u2019s toxicity showed that Kunmingmice fedwithroasted Raphani Semen had the highest mortality, dirtierbody hair, and more liquid-form feces, while the other twogroups fed with dried and overroasted samples had relativelymild adverse responses. The observed abnormalities maybe attributed to the chemical changes during the roastingprocess of Raphani Semen which led to the increased GImovement [103]. Another study assessed the acute toxicity ofRaphani Semen cold-water extract on Balb/c mice [92]. Nodeath of animal was observed at the maximum tested oraldose (10 g/kg). Additionally, no apparent GI or behavioralside effects were identified during the testing period [92].The discrepancy in the results of different studies may beattributed to the difference in animal species used, content ofactive components inRaphani Semen extracts, and extractionmethods adopted. Since different processing methods onRaphani Semen could give different levels of toxicity, moreattention should be paid when choosing the processingmethod of Raphani Semen. It is suggested to adopt thestandardized simple stir-bakingmethod of the seeds recordedin CP (Appendix II D) [3] so as to ensure the therapeuticefficacy and reduce possible risk of inducing toxicity.Raphani Semen contains high content of erucic acid. It isa long-chain unsaturated fatty acid. Studies found that erucicacid had adverse effect on heart as erucic acid was poorlyoxidized by the mitochondrial \ud835\udefd-oxidation system, especiallyby the myocardial cells, which resulted in an accumulationof erucic acid, producing myocardial lipidosis [106, 107].Although the negative effect has not been confirmed inhumans, a variety of animal species fed with erucic acidcould result in forming myocardial lipidosis in a dose-dependent manner. Erucic acid also interacts with otherdrugs. When applied alone, erucic acid showed no negativeeffect on survival and cardiac contractility in Wistar albinorats. However, under concomitant use with doxorubicin (adrug used for chemotherapy), erucic acid could enhance thetoxicity of doxorubicin [108]. So far, the adverse effects ofRaphani Semen consumption due to the presence of erucicacid have not been reported. There are reports on animalstudies about induction of myocardial lipidosis occurrencesafter the consumption of pure or high concentration of erucicacid but not the TCM herb, Raphani Semen. Owing tothe multiple pharmacological effects of Raphani Semen andthe high content of bioactive compounds such as linolenicacid in Raphani Semen, it is worthwhile to launch moreinvestigations to evaluate the risks and benefits of usingRaphani Semen.6. Raphani Semen in PerspectivesDespite the fact that Raphani Semen is commonly used inTCM, there is a lack of in-depth study on the pharmacologicaleffects of its active ingredients. It was found that among thereported pharmacological effects, most of them are related tochronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetesmellitus. For the progression of those chronic diseases,reactive oxygen species plays an important role. In viewof the abundance of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, andother compounds with high antioxidant power in RaphaniSemen, it may be possible to identify new drug candidateor lead compound for treating cardiovascular diseases anddiabetes mellitus. Further studies on both pharmacology andchemistry could provide valuable insight into this area.So far, there is no report about the adverse/toxicityeffects of this herb on humans. However, Raphani Semenprocessed by roasting was reported to exhibit some adverseeffects onmice. Additionally, erucic acid, an active compoundfrom Raphani Semen, was shown to enhance the toxicityEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 13of doxorubicin. Thus, Raphani Semen has a potential riskof causing drug interaction. Since the undesirable effects ofRaphani Semen overdosage are still not clearly evaluated,toxicology test is a must to examine its potential harmfuleffects on normal human cells and experimental animals.In summary, Raphani Semen is a valuable TCMherbwithmultiple pharmacological effects. More studies on RaphaniSemen should be done for a better understanding of itspharmacological mechanisms so as to provide clear scien-tific evidence to explain its traditional uses, to identify itstherapeutic potential on other diseases, and to understand itspossible harmful effects.AbbreviationsACE: Angiotensin converting enzymeGI: GastrointestinalNO: Nitric oxideNOS: Nitric oxide synthaseCP: Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republicof ChinaPPL: Porcine pancreatic lipaseRs-AFP and RAP: Raphanus Sativus Antifungal ProteinSHR: Spontaneously hypertensive ratsTCM: Traditional Chinese Medicine.Conflict of InterestsTheauthors have declared that there is no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThis research was financially supported by the Departmentof Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The HongKong Polytechnic University, and the Shenzhen MunicipalKey Laboratory Advancement Program, Shenzhen, China.References[1] L.
