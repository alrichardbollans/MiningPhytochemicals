ABSTRACT: Plants have been significant in human development since ancient times, providing natural medicine that promotes a long, healthy life free from illness. Emblica officinalis, a medicinal plant also known as amla or Indian gooseberry, belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. This herbaceous plant has been widely used for its medicinal qualities, with the fruits being particularly beneficial. People use amla fruits for both medicinal and tonic purposes, aiming to restore their lost vitality and stamina. They contain high levels of minerals, amino acids, vitamin C, and other vital micronutrients. Traditional medicine uses these fruits to treat conditions such as diarrhea, jaundice, and inflammation. E. officinalis includes a variety of bioactive substances with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, and other pharmacological activity, including tannins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids, and ascorbic acids. The review includes the pharmacological characteristics, traditional use, geographic distribution, commercialization, and therapeutic qualities of this highly regarded medicinal plant. Introduction: Ayurveda, an Indian traditional medicinal system, regards amla (Emblica officinalis) (EO) as sacred. According to Indian mythology, Amla, also known as Indian gooseberry or Phyllanthus emblica, was the first tree to exist in the universe and is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. Amla grows not only in its native India but also in Southeast Asia, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, and other tropical and subtropical climates. Objectives: The objective of the current study was to estimate the Emblica officinalis' chemical composition, pharmacological activity, commercialization, taxonomic classification, Vernacular name, and profile. Methods: The literature used in this work was sourced from a number of databases, including Research Gate, Google Scholar, Pubmed, and Scopus. Conclusions: Amla, also known as Indian gooseberry, has been used in traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda, and tribal medicine for many years. This plant contains various phytochemicals, including tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenolic compounds. In recent decades, researchers have started investigating the biological and biopharmaceutical properties of these phytochemicals found in amla. Some of the important compounds found in Amla include emblicanin A, gallic acid, emblicanin B, ellagic acid, quercetin, phyllantidine, and phyllantine, which have shown different biological activities. 1. Introduction Ayurveda, an Indian traditional medicinal system, regards amla (Emblica officinalis) (EO) as sacred. According to Indian mythology, Amla, also known as Indian gooseberry or Phyllanthus emblica, was the first tree to exist in the universe and is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. Amla grows not only in its native India but also in Southeast Asia, China, Pakistan, 1652 Journal of Chemical Health Risks www.jchr.org JCHR (2024) 14(3), 1651-1664 | ISSN:2251-6727 Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, and other tropical and subtropical climates. [1] Ayurvedic remedies frequently include amla fruits because they are believed to strengthen the body's defenses against disease. [2] It can help with degenerative disorders like cancer, diabetes, anemia, liver disease, heart problems, and ulcers. Several hepatoprotective formulas rely heavily on it as a key component. Amla, one of the richest sources of minerals and amino acids, is extremely nutrient-dense, including vitamin C. [3] Its chemical makeup is diverse and includes alkaloids, tannins, and phenols. [4] Among all the hydrolyzable tannins, ellagic acid, gallic acid, and emblicanin A and B have demonstrated biological activity. Nearly every component has therapeutic qualities, but the fruit is especially useful. It is a potent rasayana in Ayurveda and conventional medicine; it is used to treat conditions such as inflammation, jaundice, diarrhea, and other conditions. [5] The amla fruit is a major component of the Indian medical system, either by itself or in conjunction with other plants. It functions as an antipyretic, laxative, diuretic, liver tonic, stomachic, refrigerant, and hair tonic to cure fever and the common cold, as well as to avoid ulcers and dyspepsia. According to pharmacological research, amla possesses several beneficial effects, including analgesic, [6] antitussive, [7] anti-atherogenic, [8] adaptogenic, [9] cardioprotective, [10] gastroprotective, [11] nephroprotective, [12] neuroprotective, [13] anticancer, [14] and gastroprotective. [11] Additionally, chemopreventive, [15] radioactive, [16] chemopreventive, [17] immunomodulatory, [18] free radical scavenging, [19] antioxidant, [19] anti-inflammatory, [20] and anti-mutagenic properties have all been linked to amla. Atherosclerosis, diabetes, gastric ulcers, liver, heart, and cancer disorders, as well as anemia, can all be effectively treated and prevented using these qualities. Classification 1. Amla Fruits: The amla fruit is almost spherical, with a width of 18 to 25 mm. The pericarp, or mesocarp, of the fruit is yellow, while the endocarp ripens to a yellowish-brown colour. Fresh Amla fruit's mesocarp tastes sour, but dried fruit that is 20 mm in length has a puckery taste. and mature between November and February. Its six fuzzy vertical lines split its perfect surface. The central Amla leaves have a width of 2-3 mm and a length of >8\u201310 mm. Cats frequently feed on these hairless, light green leaves. On the underside, they are either pale green or frequently pubescent. 2. Amla Oil: The seeds and fruits of the amla plant yield amla oil. Its fat and oil have a colour range from golden yellow to light brown. It has a pleasant aroma with hints of sweetness and nuttiness. This oil is known for its moisturizing properties and has a moderately thick consistency. 3. Amla seeds: Each fruit contains four to six dark brown, smooth-to-touch seeds. They make an excellent source of amla oil. Amla seeds commonly treat bronchitis and asthma. 4. Amla bark (Amla extract): It is typically 12 mm thick and has a gray-brown or gray-green tint. The alcoholic extraction method for amla fruit extract yields an extremely effective antiviral extract.[21] Fig. 1: Amla or E. officinalis Table 1: Vernacular names of E. officinalis [22,23,24] S.no Language Vernacular names 1.

Characteristic Description Nature environment South East Asia, Uzbekistan, southern and central India, the Macaprene Islands, southern China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. [27,28,1] Appearance A medium-sized, deciduous tree that ranges in height from 8 to 18 meters. The bark of the tree is light gray and sheds in small, uneven flakes.[29] Used part Fresh fruit, dried fruit, seeds, leaves, bark from the roots, and flowers. [1,30] Leaves Simple, subsessile, light green, and resembling pinnae. Closely spaced along the branchlets.[29] Fruits 15\u201325 mm in length and 18\u201325 mm in width; both apexes have a tiny, subtle conic depression, and the shape is almost spherical or globular. When fully ripe, the endocarp is yellowish brown, whereas the mesocarp is yellow. [1] Globose, juicy, and pale yellow, three crustacean cocci with two seeds apiece have six dark vertical grooves encircling six trigonous seeds.[29] Globose, juicy, and pale yellow in hue, three crustacean cocci with two seeds each have six trigonous seeds encircled by six dark vertical grooves.[31] Ripe fruits take on a light brown colour, whereas fresh fruits have a bright green hue. On average, the fruit weighs between 60 and 70 grams.[30] Flowers Greenish-yellow, axillary fascicle-forming, unisexual; few subsessile, 3-celled ovary females; and many men on short, slender pedicels. [29,27] Seeds Six, silky, deep brown.[1] Barks Thick to 12 mm, gleaming either gray-green or gray-brown.[1] Flowering and fruits December, January, and February\u2013May. [27] Edible part The hard stone that encases the seed is made up of mesocarp and endocarp.[32] Chemical constituents Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is abundant in amla fruit and has a concentration of 600\u2013750 mg per 100 grams of 1654 Journal of Chemical Health Risks www.jchr.org JCHR (2024) 14(3), 1651-1664 | ISSN:2251-6727 fresh pulp. In addition, fruits have roughly 5% tannin, phyllemblin, and 0.5 percent fat. Amla fruits are also a good source of calcium, iron, and phosphorus. It has a significant pectin content. The fresh fruits have approximately 75% moisture. We dry the fruits and store them. Studies have demonstrated that the vitamin content of dried fruits remains significantly intact. It might be because tannins are present, which slow down the oxidation of vitamin C.

[42] In a study comparing its effectiveness with the antibiotic Grisofulvin, E. officinalis fruit extracts in both acetone and ethanol exhibited some efficacy against Fusarium equiseti and Candida albicans, two other types of fungi. [43] However, the phytoanolic extract of E. officinalis could not inhibit the growth of Aspergillus niger F2723, which is a phytopathogenic fungus. [44] Activity as a free radical scavenger and antioxidant The total phenolic material, called gallic acid equivalent, is present in the fruit and seeds of E. officinalis. This acid has strong antioxidant properties and is crucial for scavenging free radicals, which are needed to maintain redox equilibrium, which is linked to several degenerative disorders.[45] Emblica officinalis methanolic seed extract exhibits concentration-dependent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) free radical eliminates action.[46] Fruit pulp methanolic extract has anti-oxidant and absorbance of free radicals properties as well.[47,48,49,50,51] Several The study concluded with positive evidence that the methyl alcohol extract of dried Phyllanthus emblica leaves has both antibacterial and antioxidant activity, based on a comparative analysis.[52] In a different study, it was shown that the E. officinalis fruit water extract made by the ability of Thai herbal pharmacopoeia to reduce ferric iron is rather high, free radical scavenging, and preventing the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species). [53] Insecticidal activity Important components of E. officinalis, saponins, can kill or poison some insects. [54] Even so, saponins that exhibited insecticidal activity were gathered from non-E. officinalis natural sources. However, since E. officinalis also contains bioactive substances called saponins, it is clear that the plant may have insecticidal potential. Additional research can be done to determine this with greater accuracy. Mozzicidal and larvicidal activity We tested the ability of Anopheles stephensi, the malaria vector, to kill mosquitoes. We discovered that the methanol extract of E. officinalis effectively killed both larvae and pupae, achieving a 98% mortality rate at a concentration of 100 parts per million (ppm). [55,56] At concentrations of 400 ppm and higher, both the methanol and ethanol extracts of E. officinalis showed complete mortality, meaning no eggs hatched. Another study found that Phyllanthus emblica leaf ethyl acetate extract also possesses larvicidal qualities. The ethyl acetate extract from Phyllanthus emblica leaves is also larvicidal (99.6%) against Aedes aegypti larvae, with an LC50 value of 78.89 ppm. The LC50 value represents the concentration at which 50% of the larvae die. These findings indicate the potential use of both E. officinalis and P. emblica extracts as natural insecticides to control mosquito populations, thereby aiding in the prevention of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. [56] Antidepressant activity Antidepressant has tested a Swiss Albino mouse, an adult male, weighing 25\u201330 g to see if an aqueous solution of E. officinalis fruits has any antidepressant effects. The test was administered using a forced swim evaluate (FST) and a tail suspension test (TST). The test's outcome demonstrated that E. officinalis's antidepressant activity was on par with that of imipramine, a common antidepressant medication. [57] Immunostimulating activity Triphala may enhance the neutrophil activities of immune-stimulated albino rats, according to reports. [58] When albino mice were treated with Emblica, there were 1657 Journal of Chemical Health Risks www.jchr.org JCHR (2024) 14(3), 1651-1664 | ISSN:2251-6727 dose-dependent increases in a number of parameters. These included serum globulin, peritoneal macrophage migration index, hypersensitivity reaction, total leukocyte count, lymphocyte dispersion percentage, macrophage respiratory burst activity, and relative lymphoid organ weight. These findings indicate that Emblica can also activate macrophage phagocytes, as well as humoral and cell-mediated immunity. [59] Anti-inflammatory properties In Sprague-Dawley rats, E. officinalis demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. In the former, carrageenan-induced inflammation reduced paw volume, while in the latter, the cotton pellet induced myeloperoxidase activity, plasma extravasation, granulomatous tissue mass, and tissue lipid peroxidation. [60] E. officinalis water extract inhibits the generation and release of inflammatory mediators in rats. [61] Anti-proliferative and anti-cancer properties E. officinalis showed promise in treating cervical cancer caused by the human papillomavirus by blocking activator protein-1 and focusing on the gene regulation of viral oncogenes that cause the disease. [62] We treated five human cancer cell lines with an ethanol-based entire extract of the plant E. officinalis at a concentration of 100 g/ml in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. Plant extract showed an 82% growth inhibition against the lung cell line (A-549). The plant extract was inactive in the Hep-2 liver cell line, but it was most active in the colon 502713 cell line. The neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 and the human liver cancer line HT-29 demonstrated significant activity in 97 percent and 98 percent of the plant's extract. [63] E. officinalis fruit extract, at levels between fifty and one hundred g/mL, can effectively inhibit the growth of six lines of human cancer cells: ovarian (SK-OV3), livers (HepG2), respiratory (A549), breast (MDA-MB-231), and colon (SW620). [64] We assessed the effects of P. emblica and T. bellerica extracts on HepG2 and A549 cells using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, either in isolation or in conjunction with doxorubicin or cisplatin. The two plant extracts effectively prevented the two cancer cell types under investigation from proliferating. [64] Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the cytotoxicity of amla extracts and their ability to suppress the growth of several carcinoma cell lines in vitro, including B16F10 (murine melanoma) and MK-1 (human gastric adenocarcinoma). [65] HIV-inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity The study used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to investigate the effects of different fractions of P. emblica plant extract on HIV-Reverse Transcriptase (HIV-RT). The researchers examined the inhibitory activity of these fractions on recombinant HIV-RT. The results demonstrated that the n-hexane fraction and hydrophilic fraction exhibited the strongest suppression of HIV-RT at a 1 mg/ml concentration, with inhibitory levels of 91% and 89%, respectively. The chloroform fraction showed the greatest amount of HIV-RT inhibition at 0.5 mg/ml, whereas the carbon tetrachloride fraction showed the highest level of inhibition at 0.12 mg/ml. Compared to the aqueous and n-hexane fractions, the inhibition was less in both cases. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the n-hexane and carbon tetrachloride fractions inhibited, at dosages of 0.12 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively, fifty percent of the HIV-RT activity. [66] Anti-ulcerogenic properties E. officinalis ethanolic extract effectively prevents H. pylori from proliferating in vitro. The range of the lowest inhibitory control levels was 0.91 to 1.87 \u00b5g/\u00b5l. This study also revealed that amla\u2019s ethanolic plant extract retained its flavonoids, antioxidant properties, reducing power, and total phenolics. As a result, it can be considered a viable treatment option for gastric ulcers and H. pylori infections. [67] Antimutagenic and wound healing activity A study on Swiss albino mice demonstrated that a 50% methanolic extract of Emblica fruit could protect the mice against the known mutagen cyclophosphamide. [68] Strong antioxidants like tannins and ascorbic acid, namely emblicanin B and emblicanin A, are present in this extract. Proposals suggest that these antioxidants aid in cell repair. In addition, the study revealed increases in tensile strength, aldehyde content, type III collagen, acid-soluble collagen, DNA, and shrinking temperature. Furthermore, the study showed that signals outside the cell regulated an increase in kinase 1/2 activity. These results imply that the emblica stimulates wound-related cellular growth. [69] 1658 Journal of Chemical Health Risks www.jchr.org JCHR (2024) 14(3), 1651-1664 | ISSN:2251-6727 In vitro culture Researchers developed a one-step approach to high-energy somatic embryogenesis using in vitro techniques from Emblica officinalis juvenile leaf tissues. For the most callus formation (67.5%), the researchers found that a solution with 0.45 \u00b5M 2, 4-dichloro phenoxy acetic acid and 22 \u00b5M 6-benzyl aminopurine worked best. Furthermore, by directly producing proembryos in MS media, they successfully carried out somatic embryogenesis and plantlet regeneration using cotyledon explants derived from in vitro germinated seeds. [70] Additionally, the researchers evaluated the efficacy of shoot proliferation using nodal explants and found that the MS medium was the most effective for this purpose.
