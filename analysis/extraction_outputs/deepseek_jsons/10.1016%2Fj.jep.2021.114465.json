The most wiedly used species is P. officinarum Vaill., included in the British and French Pharmacopoeias and sold as part of different commercial products. Aim of the study: This review critically appraises the state-of-art of ethnopharmacology, specialised metabolites, bioactivities, and toxicity of members of Hieracium and Pilosella. Thus, gaps in scientific knowledge can be identified, also focusing on the development of products with pharmacological applications. Materials and methods: Literature data of Hieracium and Pilosella species were mainly retrieved using different electronic databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and PubMed. Other electronic resources included worldwide databases on ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, and phytochemistry as well as government reports. Additionally, ancient texts and local information such as PhD and MSc theses, and books were consulted. Results: A comprehensive analysis of the above mentioned sources revealed that only 34 out of the about 850 described species within the genera Hieracium and Pilosella have been reported in the context of traditional medicinal and ethnobotanical knowledge. The most often mentioned species is P. officinarum which has been widely used due to its diuretic effects. Other popular uses of Hieracium and Pilosella species include the treatment of skin, gastric, and intestinal diseases as well as respiratory and vascular ailments. Moreover, taxa of the two genera have been used as antiobiotics, antiseptics, antidiabetics, tonics, antiepileptics, antiphlogistics, emetics, wound healing drugs, astringents, haemostatics, and detoxificants. Finally, uses as a wild vegetable, fodder, plant for hunting and for charming rituals have also been mentioned. Phytochemical research revealed a richness in phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Moreover, coumarins, sesquiterpene lactones, terpenoids, and phytosterols were found in Hieracium and Pilosella. Experimental research conducted to support traditional uses mainly include in vitro tests, while assays based on in vivo models (including humans) are rather limited. Also, the vast majority of the studies did not identify the compounds responsible for the detected bioactivities. These estab-lished bioactivities include antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antimycotic, antiviral, cytotoxic and antiproliferative, diuretic, gastroprotective, antiepileptic, hypotensive, anti-obesity, arthropodicidal, and skin rejuvenating activities. Finally, limited toxicity studies have been conducted on members of Hieracium and Pilosella. Conclusion: Taxa belonging to Hieracium and Pilosella have been confirmed to exert diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects, which is in line with their long traditional use. Moreover, the above mentioned fields of application hint to the most promising routes for the development of new marketable products. Nonetheless, additional data from an in-depth research on bio-active specialised metabolites such as sesquiterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, and coumarines, their bioactivities and toxicity, and their biosynthesis are still warranted. * Corresponding author.

Introduction The genera Hieracium L. and Pilosella Hill, in English both commonly called hawkweeds, include a complex of shrubs having mostly yellow flowerheads of strap-shaped florets (ligules) that normally grow in pastures distributed in the temperate areas of the world, excluding Australasia (Garland, 1990; Heywood, 1993; Gottschlich, 1996). A limited number of taxa have been introduced into North America and New Zealand; some of those are very invasive weeds (Travers, 1884; Wilson, 2006). Both genera were usually treated as two subgenera of the Hieracium genus. However, the main differences to separate Pilosella from Hieracium are based on morphological characters (pre-sence/absence of stolons; pappus hairs in one row/pappus hairs in two rows) and differing mechanisms of apomixis: apospory/diplospory (Zidorn et al., 2002)). Hieracium and Pilosella are members of the tribe Cichorieae (Asteraceae) and comprise more than 850 wild species and subspecies, and over 10,000 micro-species, constituting two of the most diverse genera in the entire plant kingdom (Na\u0308geli and Peter, 1885; Na\u0308geli and Peter, 1886\u20131889; Zahn, 1921\u20131923; Gottschlich, 1996). For this reason, it is not surprising that species belonging to these genera had traditional uses in ethnopharmacology, as well as certain popularity as medicinal plant-derived products. For instance, P. officinarum Vaill. was introduced in the European Union market of medicinal herbs in 1986 due to its diuretic properties (EMA/HMPC/680374/2013). Along with the diuretic activity of this species, it has gained popularity as antioxi-dant due to its content in phenolic acids (Becker et al., 2017; Bor-isova-Jan et al., 2017). The current medicinal importance of P. officinarum is evidenced by the recent increasing number of scientific publications dealing with its therapeutical value, potential applications, and quality control of its commercial products. In this regard, Bilia et al. (2007) studied the stability and content of bioactive metabolites in herbal drug preparations (tinctures and mother tinctures) made from this species. Also, Borisova-Jan et al. (2017) developed an HPLC method for the quantitative determination of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives as characteristic constituents used as analytical markers in the quality control of the herbal material of P. officinarum. Fritz (2011) performed anatomical analyses of P. officinarum and H. murorum L. rhizomes as comparative studies on underground parts of medicinally used drugs and possible adulterations of these taxa. Also, Becker et al. (2017) demonstrated that grinding and sieving increased the bioactive com-pounds content and improved the antioxidant activity of P. officinarum powders when processing for commercial products supply. In addition, some patents are based on products containing P. officinarum in their formulas. For instance, a dermocosmetic mixture was patented for depigmentation in conditions of hyperchromia (https://patents.google.com/patent/US5869031?oq = Pilosella +officinarum + patent). Bae et al. (2013) also patented a nine-plants mixture containing H. albiflorum Hook. aimed to treat allergic skin in-flammations. Most of the works reported to date have been focused on P. officinarum. However, given the wide diversity within Hieracium and Pilosella genera, it is certainly interesting to investigate whether other species also present medicinal properties. In this regard, we address the following questions: What other species of Hieracium and Pilosella are traditionally used in folk medicine? What of these applications are supported by experimental proofs of biological activity? What do we know about specialised metabolites present in these species? Are these compounds responsible to exert the tested biological activities? In order to answer these questions, this work tries to undertake a comprehensive review on the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological, and pharmacological activities, as well as toxicology of members of the genera Hieracium and Pilosella. The traditional uses and how this infor-mation is linked to the known chemical constituents and proven bio-activities is critically discussed. Specific gaps in our knowledge, methodological considerations on the previously published studies, as well as future research lines and applications are also highlighted in order to gain new insights into the possible revalorisation of Hieracium and Pilosella as medicinal plants. 2. Methodology Literature data were mainly retrieved using the electronic databases Web of Science, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and PubMed. The search strategy included the following keywords: Hieracium, Pilosella, ethno-pharmacology, ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, bioactivities. For Web of Science the search strategy was based on the equation: (\u201cethno-botany\u201d OR \u201cphytochemistry\u201d OR \u201cethnopharmacology\u201d OR \u201cbio-activities\u201d OR \u201ctraditional uses\u201d OR \u201csecondary metabolism\u201d OR \u201cactivity\u201d OR \u201cchemical composition\u201d OR \u201cnatural products\u201d) AND (\u201cHieracium\u201d OR \u201cPilosella\u201d). Other electronic resources were checked and those where information on Hieracium and Pilosella species was found included: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Duke\u2019s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases, Ethnobotanical Database of Bangladesh (EDB), European Medicines Agency (EMA), International Ethnobotany Database (ebDB), Indian Medicinal Plants Database (FRLHT), Native American Ethnobotany Database (BRIT), Tesauro de Plantas Medicinales (Base Jerarquizada). Also, ancient texts (Lonitzer, 1551; Fuchs, 1557; Laguna, 1563; Matthiole, 1572; Lemery, Fig. 1. Iconographies of pre-Linnean mentions of Hieracium and Pilosella spe-cies: (a) H. parvum (Fuchs, 1557), (b) P. maior (Lonitzer, 1551), (c) P. minor (Lonitzer, 1551), (d) H. majus (Matthiole, 1572), (e) H. minus (Mat-thiole, 1572). J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446531714; Scopoli, 1760) were consulted (Fig. 1). Local information such as PhD and MSc theses, books, etc. were also checked. All entries until December 2020 were considered. In the particular case of local tradi-tional uses, only primary data revealed in ethnobotanical works were taken into account. Sources referring to traditional uses from other texts (e.g. reviews) were cited if the authors could not find the original reference. On the other hand, literature not providing additional infor-mation to articles previously found (e.g. same authors for the same research area and species) have not been cited. Exact spelling of scien-tific botanical names (including the abbreviations for botanical authors) was brought in line with standard usage recommended by \u201cWorld Flora Online\u201d (http://www.worldfloraonline.org/) or \u201cGlobal Composite Checklist\u201d (https://compositae.landcareresearch.co.nz/Default.aspx) and \u201cCichorieae Portal\u201d (http://cichorieae.e-taxonomy.net/portal/ node/8). The authors named the analysed taxa as they were found in the original reference and checked using the above-mentioned data-bases. Specialised metabolites reported for the genera Hieracium and Pilosella are displayed in Figs. 2\u201317. Substituents including sugar moi-eties used in abbreviated forms in Figs. 2\u201317 are depicted and explained in Fig. 18. Primary metabolites such as fatty acids, as well as mono-terpenes detected by GC-MS analyses are not included (Feulner et al., 2009, 2011; Ugur et al., 2010). Clifford and Abranko\u0301 (2017) pointed out the ambiguous nature of the trivial name isochlorogenic acid refering to different (di-)caffeoylquinic acids in literature. Therefore, iso-chlorogenic acid was not depicted (Giner et al., 1992; Man\u0303ez et al., 1994). Both stereochemistry and linkage type of sugar moieties, espe-cially those of xylosides and arabinosides, were in many cases insuffi-ciently elucidated in the consulted literature. Hence, the abbreviated forms of the regarding substituents are marked with * when the exact stereochemistry was not provided by the authors. In case of glucose moieties often the linkage type, as well as the stereochemistry was partially stated. Due to the general domination of \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside in specialised metabolites, substances are stated as such if information on both stereochemistry and linkage type were partially provided by the authors. Fraisse et al. (2011) detected chlorogenic acid in their investigation of 18 taxa from the Asteraceae, which was stated as 3-caffeoylquinic acid. Current IUPAC numbering however translates chlorogenic acid to 5-caffeoylquinic acid (Clifford and Abranko\u0301, 2017). The review is divided into three main parts: 1) ethnopharmacology, 2) phytochemistry, and 3) bioactivities for species of the genera Hiera-cium and Pilosella. 3. Ethnopharmacology 3.1. Pre-Linnean mentions of Hieracium and Pilosella: properties and uses According to Pliny, the name Hieracium L. (hawk in Greek) is related to the use of this species\u2019 juice by the hawks to avoid blindness (Teixidor y Cos, 1871). Lonitzer (1551) mentioned that two species of Hieracium (Fig. 1): H. majus [UR] and H. minus [UR] exhibit refreshing and mod-erate astringent properties. According to this author, the distilled water (aqua stillatitia) of Hieracium, prepared with three or four tablespoons of the herb, was used internally to treat sores and fiery fevers. It also mitigates body aches and coughs and calms the heat. The H. majus juice was also used to stop the heartburn. The distilled water and juice of this plant were used to clean and heal the macules of the eyes, to cleanse wrinkles and to treat the lack of visual acuity. However, Lonitzer (1551) pointed out that the juice was somewhat weaker. According to this author, the crushed leaves or the above-mentioned distilled water impregnated in fine linen are able to heal the black and inflamed pus-tules of the skin in any part of the body. The translation of Dioscorides made by Fuchs (1557) mentions that H. parvum [NV] has remarkable astringent and bitter properties. Moreover, this author cites Pliny and says that the juice is mixed with womens\u2019 milk in order to heal the eye\u2019s Fig. 2. Phenylmethanoids. Fig. 3. Phenylethanoids. Fig. 4. Phenylpropanoids.

The root, hanging from the neck, removes the darkness of the sight. In the translation of the Dioscorides De Materia Me\u0301dica made by Laguna (1563) there are mentions of the medicinal properties of H. majus and H. minus. Both species are mentioned to be useful against inflammations and stomach pain. Also, a plaster made from the whole plant (including roots) is externally applied to treat scorpion stings. Matthiole (1572) also mentioned the properties to cure the eyes by these plants (Fig. 1) taking the stems and making a juice. This author also pointed out that this plant is an excellent remedy to cure the eye\u2019s Fig. 7. Umbelliferone and related compounds. Fig. 8. Flavanones. Fig. 9. Flavones. Fig. 10. Flavonols. Fig. 11. Sesquiterpene lactones: 12,8-germacranolides. J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 1144655illnesses. Finally, Lemery (1714) stated that H. minus, among other Compositae named dens leonis, had several beneficial properties. It is written that Hieracium (Hieracium dentis leonis folio obtuso majus C. B. Pit. Tourn..; Hieracium longius radicatum, Ger. Park. Raii. hift. and Hieracium macrorhizon Tab.) contains a lot of phlegm and oil, poorly essential, and fixed salts. The medicine is used mainly from its root: it is humectant, refreshing and slightly astringent. 3.2. Pilosella officinarum Vaill. The use of P. officinarum is quite ancient as it was revealed by the literature research. The first mention of Hieracium pilosella L. [SAN: Pilosella officinarum Vaill.] appears in the 12th Century by the German Benedictine abbess Saint Hildegard of the Rhine as a cardiotonic (Mulet, 1991). It has been also cited in the Myrepsos\u2019 Dynameron, a Byzantine medical compendium written in the 13th Century and containing rem-edies mostly inherited from the ancient classic Greek and imperial Roman periods (Valiakos et al., 2017): H. pilosella was prepared in a multi-plant refreshing beverage. Scopoli (1760) mentioned the medici-nal properties of the decoction to treat joint problems and to heal hernia in children. The use of this species was extended in Europe along the Middle Age (Chevallier, 2000; Dal Cero, 2016), the Renaissance, Modern and Contemporary times (Dal Cero, 2016). It is currently included in the European (within the formulae of tinctures and mother tinctures), French and British Pharmacopoeias. It was introduced in the European Union market of medicinal herbs in 1986 (http://www.ema.europa.eu/) and it has become a popular commercial herbal remedy to treat urinary pathologies (Darias et al., 2008). Currently, it has a wide diffusion as a dietary supplement for slimming as well in Europe and South America (Bilia et al., 2007; Hurrell and Puentes, 2013). Preparations of this plant are legally sold under different marketing formats all over the world: for instance, herbal tea for oral use, both in solid or liquid dosages, hydroalcohol extract, tinctures, hard and powdered herbs e.g. in cap-sules (Beaux et al., 1999; Bilia et al., 2007; Hurrell and Puentes, 2013; Becker et al., 2017; http://www.ema.europa.eu/). According to the therapeutic properties of P. officinarum, a wide array of ailments is treated with this species in traditional medicine. Among them, urinary diseases (including some renal troubles), skin problems, and gastric and intestinal illnesses are the most cited. 3.2.1. Diuretic effect and its relation to urinary tract illnesses Font Quer (1981) compiled the remarkable diuretic properties of Fig. 12. Sesquiterpene lactones: eudesmanolides. Fig. 13. Sesquiterpene lactones: 12,6-guaianolides. Fig. 14. Pentacyclic terpenoids: ursane type. Fig. 15. Pentacyclic terpenoids: oleane type. J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 1144656H. pilosella infusion in its Dioscorides Renovado: \u2018According to doctor Leclerc the amount of urine can be doubled or tripled by the influence of this plant, along with the increase of chloride and urea eliminated. This is not influenced by the absorbed water with the decoction or infusion because little amounts of its liquid extract exert the same results. Therefore, it is a plant given against hydropathy, nephritis, ascites, edema, etc., and, in general, whenever it is convenient to rid the or-ganism of waste products without irritating the renal epithelium\u2019. The diuretic effect of the whole plant has been widely recorded in folk medicine in different points of the European geography such as the Spanish Regions of Extremadura, taken as infusion of aerial parts (Va\u0301zquez, 2008), in Aragonese Pyrenees taken as cold infusion (Villar et al., 1987), and in Forcall (Valencian Region) taken as a 150 mL decoction of the aerial parts at 3% one or two times per day (Mulet, 1991). In Campania Region, Italy (Guarino et al., 2008), the infusion of blooming plants is used as diuretic and to cause resorption of ascitic effusions of cardiac origin. In Southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, roots and aerial parts of H. pilosella are very appreciated in the treatment of kidney problems (to dissolve kidney stones) and urinary system diseases (mainly infections and inflammation processes such as prostate inflammation) or generally to improve urination (Redz\u030cic\u0301, 2010), as well as in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Northern Russia (Astrologova and Feklistov, 2002). In Deliblato Sand (Serbia) it is used to treat uremia taken as a tea of the fresh root, leaves and fruits prepared by boiling 10 g of herb in 100 g of water (Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014). In Bulgaria, Ivancheva and Stantcheva (2000) found its use as diuretic, taken as the infusion of aerial parts. Also, Efremov and Shreter (1996) reported its use to treat uremia and urolithiasis diseases in this country. The usual way to pre-pare the medicine in Bulgaria is taking the aerial parts or the whole blooming plant and prepare an infusion to be drunk (Ivancheva and Stantcheva, 2000; Leporati and Ivancheva, 2003; Astrologova and Feklistov, 2002; Redz\u030cic\u0301, 2007; Guarino et al., 2008; Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014). In German folk medicine, the alcoholic tincture of herbs is taken to treat stones in the kidney and bladder. In Turkey it is used as diuretic (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 1992\u20132016.). 3.2.2. Skin problems Different kind of skin problems are treated with P. officinarum preparations. An infusion of the whole plant is mentioned to be useful to heal extrenal and internal wounds in Font Quer (1981). Fresh leaves are directly applied (or after smashing them) to the skin in order to heal wounds in Liguria (Maccioni et al., 2004), Lombard Stelvio National Park in Alta Valtellina Region (Vitalini et al., 2015) and Waldensian valleys of the Western Alps (Bellia and Pieroni, 2015), all three places in Italy. Crushed leaves are also directly applied to heal wounds in Emb\u00fan, Aragonese Pyrenees of Spain (Villar et al., 1987). To treat skin problems there are some other preparations reported: an infusion of the aerial parts is applied to heal wounds in Prokletije Mountains in Montenegro (Menkovic\u0301 et al., 2011); a powder of the aerial part is prepared to treat and heal wounds and ulcers in Arkhangelsk Region, Russia (Astrologova and Feklistov, 2002). In Deliblato Sand (Serbia) a fresh juice of the whole plant is used to treat wounds (Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014). Also, men-tions of the dermatological properties of the whole plant were found in Extremadura, Spain (Va\u0301zquez, 2008) but the mode of preparation and administration was not explained. 3.2.3. Gastric and intestinal illnesses According to Font Quer (1981) H. pilosella has a strong astringent power and it is used against diarrhea and intestinal worms. It has been reported to be useful against dysentery, stomach and cholera spills, bloody sputum, and intestinal breaks. The infusion of the aerial part is employed as astringent in Bulgaria (Ivancheva and Stantcheva, 2000) and Spain (Rivera and Obo\u0301n, 1993; Va\u0301zquez, 2008). It has also been reported that H. pilosella decoction is prepared against diarrhea using the whole plant in the Arkhangelsk Region of Russia (Astrologova and Feklistov, 2002). The Haudenosaunee natives (Iroquouis) of the New York State of the United States of America also used hawkweed against other general gastrointestinal ailments (Frey and Meyers, 2010). In the Balkans it was recorded that a tea made from aerial parts was used to treat diarrhea (S\u030caric\u0301-Kundalic\u0301 et al., 2010). More specifically in this area, it is reported that an infusion from the whole plant is used against diarrhea in Deliblato Sand, Serbia (Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014) or in Eastern Serbia (Zlatovic\u0301 and Bogosavljevic\u0301, 2014). Also, in Morocco H. pilosella is used to treat chronic diarrhea (Mas y Guindal, 1933). So\u0303ukand and Fig. 17. Phytosterols. Fig. 18. Sugar moieties and substituents. Fig. 16. Pentacyclic terpenoids: lupane type. J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 1144657Raal (2008) reported that it is a bitter herb with constringent activity and also increases salivation and biliary secretion. In Turkey it is used as astringent (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Ser-vice, 1992\u20132016). However, the latter three sources did not specify the way of preparation and the plant organ used. 3.2.4. Respiratory and vascular ailments Popovic\u0301 et al. (2014) compiled from Deliblato Sand in Serbia the antihemorrhagic and mucolytic properties of the whole\u2019s plant infusion (10 g herb per 100 g boiling water) used to treat bronchial catarrh and heavy bleeding. \u030cSaric\u0301-Kundalic\u0301 et al. (2010) stated that a tea of the aerial parts is used to treat pulmonary ailments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Zlatovic\u0301 and Bogosavljevic\u0301 (2014) reported the same for Eastern Serbia. A multi-herb remedy with hypotensive properties was reported in the traditional medicine of West Azerbaijan (Iran) by Miraldi et al. (2001). The preparation is made from glycerin extracts of Chelidonium majus L. dried herb 0.5 g, Eupatorium cannabinum L. dried herb 2.5 g, Fumaria officinalis L. dried herb 2.5 g, H. pilosella dried herb 3 g, Frangula alnus Mill. dried bark 3 g, glycerin 40 g, water up to 200 mL, and taken in doses of one teaspoonful before meals. In Extremadura (Spain), the whole plant was cited as useful to treat bronchitis (Va\u0301zquez, 2008) but the mode of preparation was not compiled. The following references include its therapeutic value but neither the part of the plant used, nor the mode of preparation and administration is mentioned in the original sources. In Cantalojas, Guadalajara (Spain) it was reported to be used as spasmolytic and expectorant (Gil, 1995). Astrologova and Feklistov (2002) found its use against tuberculosis in Arkhangelsk, Russia. So\u0303ukand and Raal (2008) compiled that it is spasmolytic and expecto-rant, and it is internally employed in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis and cough and stops internal bleeding. In Pallars, Catalonia (Spain), it has been reported for its antigangrenous properties by Agelet and Valle\u0300s (2003) and in Morocco H. pilosella is used against passive hemorrhage (Mas y Guindal, 1933). In Turkey, it is cited to be used as expectorant, depurative, and haemostatic (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricul-tural Research Service, 1992\u20132016). 3.2.5. Uses against microorganisms Font Quer (1981) stated that the most important property of H. pilosella is its antibiotic power. According to this author, it is used against Malta fever (brucellosis) and its pathogens. In this regard, the author also mentioned that the antibiotic substance has a powerful diffusive power and passes quickly to the serum and the urine, where it acts with great efficiency, specially in septicemia. So\u0303ukand and Raal (2008) also mentioned that it is an antibiotic herb. Agelet et al. (2000) found that H. pilosella was grown in homegardens to be used as anti-mycotic in Montseny area of Catalonia (Spain). However, any of these works mentioned the part of the plant and the mode of preparation and administration. Internally, the leaf infusion has also been reported to be useful as buccopharyngic antiseptic in Catalonia (Bonet et al., 1999; Rigat et al., 2017). 3.2.6. Other uses in folk medicine Some antiviral uses have been recorded. Rigat et al. (2017) found that a tisane was taken internally to treat measles in the Catalan Pyr-enees (Ripolle\u0300s County). Also, Gras et al. (2018) reported that a tisane was taken internally to treat chickenpox in Alt Emporda\u0300 (Catalonia, Spain). However, any other information was not recorded by the authors in their ethnobotanical campaigns. Finally, other punctual references include a diverse cast of uses for this species. Astrologova and Feklistov (2002) reported from Arkhan-gelsk Region in Russia its use against liver diseases (jaundice, tumors), stomach hyposecretion, against anemia, ascites and gynecological dis-eases and general metabolic disorders. In Ukraine, the leaves were used to reduce fever (Kolosova, 2005). The antipyretic properties were also mentioned by Leporati and Ivancheva (2003) from Italy. Font Quer (1981) mentioned that H. pilosella is useful to stop women\u2019s flow. A 150 mL decoction of the aerial parts at 2%, associated with Urtica urens L. (Urticaceae) and taken two or three times per day was recorded to be antipyretic in Besassal, Valencian Region, Spain (Mulet, 1991). In the Styrian Alps (Austria) it is used to wash the eyes (Lamprecht, 2012). The same application is recorded in Deliblato Sands in Serbia where the fresh juice of the whole plant serves not only for eye inflammation, but also for mouth rinsing and inflammation and almost all ailments of internal organs (Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014). It is also recorded that an infusion of inflorescence has a tonic effect (Efremov and Shreter, 1996). The same authors also pointed out that in German folk medicine an alcoholic tincture of this herb is taken at spermatherapy. The only citation that referred to its uses in the psycho-neuronal area is found in Denmark (Ja\u0308ger et al., 2006) where an extract made from H. pilosella decoction in wine was reported to be useful against epilepsy. An infusion of the aerial part is also supplied to treat diabetes in Prokletije Mountains, Montenegro (Menkovic\u0301 et al., 2011). Externally, an extract of P. officinarum is used to prepare a lotion to be applied in the bone fracture treatments (Heinrich and Ja\u0308ger, 2015) and Adams et al. (2011) recorded that it was also externally used against malaria in the Re-naissance. Finally, So\u0303ukand and Raal (2008) compiled that it is known in folk medicine as an antiphlogistic, thus reducing inflammation. In Italy, Leporati and Ivancheva (2003) also cited it as anti-inflammatory. Va\u0301zquez (2008) mentioned its uses as antihelmintic and emenagogue in Extremadura (Spain). The reported ways of preparation and dosage are quite diverse as well: from fresh plant preparations, infusions, and decoctions to more or less complex mixtures for internal use are documented. Font Quer (1981) recommends the use of fresh plants to prepare an infusion made from 100 g of the plant added to 1 L of boiled water. Then, the herb is macerated until the water gets cold. This preparation is sweetened with honey and taken three or four times per day for internal use. Popovic\u0301 et al. (2014) reported the use of fresh roots, leaves and fruits to prepare a tea (10 g of herbs and 100 g of boiled water). Fresh juice is also used as a remedy for eye and mouth inflammations and wounds, and for almost all ailments of internal organs, including mouth rinsing. Infusions and de-coctions are mentioned by Efremov and Shreter (1996): an infusion of herbs is prepared with 10 g of crushed raw materials per 0.5 L of boiling water. Afterwards, a 1/4 glass of cooled infusion is taken 2\u20133 times a day. Finally, complex mixtures for internal use made from several me-dicinal plants are explained in section 3.3.4. 3.3. Other species In this subsection, other species of Hieracium and Pilosella are reviewed and listed alphabetically, whereas non-identified plants at species levels are collectively exposed at the end. Whenever possible, the field of application and the part of the plant used as well as the mode of preparation and dosage were compiled (Table 1). 3.4. References from unidentified species Mustafa et al. (2012) reported the topical use of the whole fresh plant of an unidentified Hieracium sp., locally named bari i majasilit te\u0308 le\u0308 kure\u0308s (\u201cleaves of Maya grass leaf\u201d), mixed with milk cream and honey to treat the eczema in Gollak region of Kosovo. Also, leaves from an unidentified Hieracium taxon are directly applied to heal wounds in Asturias, Spain (San Miguel, 2004). Finally, a mixture of an unidentified Hieracium species along with Rudbeckia sp. was employed by Cherokee for \u201cdeer\u201d disease (Shemluck, 1982) but neither the part of the plant was mentioned nor the mode of preparation and administration. The author also recorded that the juice made from two or three non determined plants of Hieracium was used as a chewing gum. An unidentified species of Hieracium from the peruvian Andes (Ancash, Per\u00fa) is traditionally used by the Quechua-speaking community to treat intestinal cramps, liver troubles, and stomach problems. The preparation that consists of boiled roots and leaves, with addition of some lime juice and alcohol is J. Willer et al.

Finally, there are some references to the use of unidentified Hieracium materials by Native American Tribes in the Native American Ethno-botany database (http://naeb.brit.org/). Iroquois prepared a poultice of Hieracium sp. roots to be applied to sores close to the bone and to treat tuberculosis by means of consumption of a decoction made from plants. The tribe Thompson prepared a gummy juice to be chewed to cleanse the mouth, or to chew for pleasure, and roots were used as a charm for unspecified purpose. Leaves of Hieracium sp. are gathered as leafy veg-etables for salads in Styria, Austria (Schunko and Vogl, 2010) or to feed the cattle in Azuay, Ecuador (Jijo\u0301n, 2015). Also, an infusion made from Hieracium sp. leaves were used as a drink or to have shower in Central Andes, Peru (Pancorbo-Olivera et al., 2020) but the specific purpose or property was not stated. 4. Specialised metabolites (Figs. 2\u201318) Hieracium and Pilosella are firmly nested within the Cichorieae tribe of the Asteraceae family and thus also share the main phytochemical features of this tribe: occurrence of various types of phenolic acids, flavonoids aglyca and glycosides, simple coumarins, sesquiterpene lac-tones, and triterpenes (Kilian et al., 2009; Zidorn et al., 2002; Sar-eedenchai and Zidorn, 2010). In this section, we detail the natural compounds that are described in both genera. So far, specialised me-tabolites have been reported by means of HPLC, HPLC-DAD, TLC, NMR, NMR-HRMS and LC-MS; more than 50 were identified only by GC-MS (Feulner et al., 2009, 2011; Ugur et al., 2010), and more than 30 were detected but not determined. 4.1. Phenolic compounds Several reports on the phytochemistry of Hieracium and Pilosella are focused on phenolics; phenolics have been reported from more than 80 Central and Eastern European taxa and other territories such as the Iberian Peninsula, New Zealand, etc. The most common phenolic com-pounds found in these genera are: chlorogenic; 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic; 1,5- dicaffeoylquinic and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids. For more detailed in-formation on the phenolic composition of the Hieracium and Pilosella complex see Tables 2 and 3. 4.2. Coumarins Biogenetically closely related to phenolic acids are coumarins which have been studied in 30 taxa of Hieracium by Bate-Smith et al. (1968). Umbelliferone was found in H. pilosella, P. hoppenana (Schult.) F.W. Schultz & Sch.Bip., and P. peleteriana (Me\u0301rat) F.W.Schultz & Sch.Bip., as well as in 6 intermediate taxa. Giner et al. (1992) obtained only trace amounts of scopoletin in H. compositum Lapeyr. More recently, umbel-liferone 7-O-\u03b2-glycopyranoside (skimmin) and esculetin 7-O-\u03b2-glycopyranoside (cichoriin) were obtained from P. officinarum (Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz and Krzaczek, 2009). Umbelliferone was found in low amounts in different plant extracts made from the whole plant of H. pilosella [SAN: P. officinarum] by Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2009) and in acetone:water extracts by Mertens et al. (2018). In a previous study Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2008) obtained the highest amount of umbelliferone in a dichloromethane:methanol extract of H. pilosella [SAN: P. officinarum]. 4.3. Flavonoids According to Sareedenchai and Zidorn (2010), the most common flavonoids in the Cichorieae are luteolin 7-O-glucoside, luteolin, luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, luteolin 4\u2032-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, api-genin 4\u2032-O-glucuronide and apigenin. As expected these compounds are also widespread in Hieracium and Pilosella (Tables 4 and 5). So far, the flavonoid composition in these genera is quite well known for Eastern and Central European taxa, and some citations are done for materials studied in Canada, Iberian Peninsula, France, etc. as it is shown in Ta-bles 4 and 5, respectively. In the supplementary data of a study on the diuretic activity of a dietary supplement (XANADREN MD\u00ae, Promo-pharma SPA) P. officinarum is mentioned to contain vitexin, an apigenin derivative (Perna et al., 2020). However, as any further information on the identification on this substance is missing, it is not included in the respective tables. 4.4. Sesquiterpene lactones Sesquiterpene lactones (SL) have also been found in the genus Hieracium: the eudesmanolide irazunolide (Fig. 12) has been reported from the Costa Rican taxon H. irasuense Benth. [AN] (Hasbun et al., 1982), and a germacranolide (germacra-7\u03b1H-1(10)E,4Z,11 (13)-trien-12,8\u03b1-olide-15-oic acid (15 \u2192 1)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl ester) in H. murorum (Zidorn et al., 2001). Also, desacylcynaropicrin was isolated from the chloroform extract of aerial parts of H. bectauatensis Kupr. [NCT] (Kanafin et al., 2015) and jacquinelin from the same species by Adekenov (2015). Finally, Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2018a) isolated four SLs from methanol extract of H. calophyllum R.Uechtr. flowering heads and performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of theses SLs in meth-anol extracts from aerial flowering parts of 28 Hieracium species from the Balkan Peninsula (the studied species are listed in Tables 2 and 4). The authors found the guaianolide crepiside E in all species, except in H. orieni A.Kern. [SAN: H. gymnocephalum Griseb. ex Pant.] and H. macrodontoides (Zahn) Zahn, in variable amounts but in 21 of them it was the most abundant SL. Also, three previously undescribed amino acid-SLs conjugates were found. Firstly, the eudesmanolide calophyll-amine B was detected in 14 species but in very low amounts, generally. Secondly, two guaianolides (calophyllamine A and 8-epiixerisamine A) were identified in all samples but in H. orieni, H. mokragorae (Na\u0308geli & Peter) Freyn [SAN: H. pannosum subsp. mokragorae Na\u0308geli & Peter], H. albopellitum (Zahn) Niketic\u0301 [SAN: H. thapsiformoides subsp. albopelli-tum (Zahn) Greuter], H. tommassinianum K.Mal\u00fd and H. macrodontoides they were found in traces. Finally, integrifolin was described from P. officinarum commercial material by Mertens et al. (2018). 4.5. Terpenoids The triterpenes \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin as well as 21\u03b1-hydroxy-taraxasterol (18\u03b1,19\u03b1-urs-20(30)-en-3\u03b2,21\u03b1-diol) were present in H. gymnocephalum aerial flowering parts chloroform extract (Petrovic\u0301 et al., 1999a).

Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz and Krzaczek (2007) studied the triterpenoid composition in herb, in-florescences, and rhizomes with roots of H. pilosella extracted with pe-troleum ether and found the following triterpenoids: \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin, taraxerol, taraxasterol, and fern-7-en-3\u03b2-ol. Taraxasterol was dominant in inflorescences, whereas \u03b2-amyrin was in herb and rhizomes with roots. Ugur et al. (2010) identified the terpenoid caryophyllene oxide and the monoterpenoid carvacrol as a major component in the chloro-form extract of P. sandrasica Hartvig & Strid [SAN: P. auriculoides (La\u0301ng) Arv.-Touv.]. Additionally, these authors also found the cyclo-aromadendrane sesquiterpenoid aromadendrene epoxide. Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2020) detected \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin, their respective acetates, as well as lupeol acetate in the dichloromethane extract of the aerial flowering parts of H. scheppigianum Freyn. 4.6. Phytosterols Sterol acetates and free sterols were investigated in detail in in-florescences extracted with petroleum ether of H. pilosella by Gawron\u0301-ska-Grywacz and Krzaczek (2006). Cholesterol, fucosterol and \u03b2-sitosterol were dominant whereas cholest-8(14)-en-3\u03b2-ol, cholesta-5, 7-dien-3\u03b2-ol, cholest-7-en-3\u03b2-ol, ergosta-5,24-dien-3\u03b2-ol, campesterol, stigmasterol, 5\u03b1-stigmast-7-en-3\u03b1-ol were identified in lesser amounts (<10% total fraction). According to these authors, the inflorescences of this species were the richest part in sterols (0.26%) whereas the content decreased in herb up to 0.24% and in roots up to 0.16% (Krzaczek et al., Table 2 (continued ) Species Extraction solvent Plant organ Compounds References H. pseudoschenkii (Rohlena & Zahn) Niketic\u0301 [SAN: H. bupleuroides bellarf. ex Willd. subsp. pseudoschenkii Rohlena & Zahn] CH3OH aerial flowering parts chlorogenic acid; 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid; 1,5- dicaffeoylquinic acid; caffeoylquinic acid Milutinovic\u0301 et al.

(2009) studied the floral scent of 27 species of Hiera-cium (currently adscribed to the genus Pilosella). Firstly, these authors found the following monoterpenes: D-limonene and (E)-\u03b2-ocimene in all studied taxa except in H. densiflorum subsp. cymosiforme Na\u0308geli & Peter [NV] and H. lactucella Wallr. [SAN: Pilosella lactucella (Wallr.) P.D.Sell & C.West] respectively; (Z)-\u03b2-ocimene in all samples but in H. cymosum L. subsp. cymosum [SAN: P. cymosa (L.) F.W.Schultz & Sch.Bip.] and H. lactucella. Other monoterpenes identified in this study are \u03b1-phel-landrene in H. piloselloides subsp. praealtum (Vill. ex Gochnat) [NV], H. densiflorum subsp. ochrocephaloides (Harz & Zahn) [SAN: P. densiflora subsp. ochrocephaloides (Harz & Zahn) Gottschl.], H. densiflorum subsp. umbelliferum (Na\u0308geli & Peter) Gottschl. [SAN: P. densiflora (Tausch) Soja\u0301k], H. bauhini Schult. subsp. hispidissimum (Rehmann ex Na\u0308geli & Peter) Zahn [SAN: Pilosella bauhini subsp. bauhini], H. cymosum subsp. cymosum, H. lactucella, H. fallacinum F.W.Schultz [SAN: P. fallacina (F.W. Schultz) F.W.Schultz], H. spurium subsp. tubulatum (Vollm.) Zahn [NV]; \u03b2-pinene in H. densiflorum subsp. umbelliferum, H. bauhini subsp. hispi-dissimum, H. calodon Tausch ex Peter subsp. phyllophorum Na\u0308geli & Peter [SAN: P. auriculoides (La\u0301ng) Arv.-Touv.], H. calodon subsp. pseudofallax Touton, H. cymosum subsp. cymosum, H. lactucella, H. schneidii Schack & Zahn [SAN: P. schneidii (Schack & Zahn) S.Bra\u0308ut. & Greuter]. L-Fenchone was found in H. densiflorum subsp. umbelliferum, H. densiflorum subsp. bauhinifolium Na\u0308geli & Peter [NV] and H. spurium subsp. tubuluatum, while linalool was present in H. densiflorum subsp. ochrocephaloides, H. densiflorum subsp. cymosiforme. D-Verbenone was only found in H. spurium subsp. tubuluatum. The occurrence of eucalyptol was restricted to low amounts in H. cymosum subsp. cymosum. Myrthenal was only found in H. bauhini subsp. hispidissimum. Also, 3 unidentified monoterpenes were detected in low amounts in this study. Secondly, these authors found ylangene and \u03b1-copaene as the most abundant sesquiterpenes in the studied samples. They also found \u03b2-bourbonene, (Z)-jasmone, (E)-\u03b2-carophyllene, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, \u03b1-gurjunene, aromadendrene, \u03b3-muurolene, germacrene D, guaiene, \u03b1-selinene, amorphene, \u03b2-selinene, \u03b4-cadinene and \u03b3-cadinene, but in most cases they were present only in traces or very low amounts (<7%). Finally, 17 sesquiterpenes, present in only low amounts within the studied samples, remained unidentified. Thirdly, they identified the following benzenoids: methyl salicylate in all studied samples except in H. echioides Lumn. subsp. echioides [SAN: P. echioides subsp. echioides (Lumn.) F.W.Schultz & Sch.Bip.], H. lactucella Wallr. and H. spurium subsp. tubulatum (Vollm.) Zahn; benzyl alcohol in H. caespitosum Dumort. subsp. caespitosum, H. bauhinii subsp. hispidissimum (Rehm.) Zahn, H. echioides subsp. echioides, H. cymosum subsp. cymosum, H. fallacinum, H. aurantiacum L. subsp. aurantiacum [SAN: P. aurantiaca (L.) F.W.Schultz & Sch.Bip.]; 4-methox-ybenzaldehyde in H. caespitosum subsp. caespitosum, H. glomeratum Froel. subsp. glomeratum [SAN: P. glomerata (Froel.) Fr.], H. zizianum subsp. adenocymigerum [SAN: P. ziziana (Tausch) F.W.Schultz & Sch. Bip.] and H. aurantiacum subsp. aurantiacum. The occurrence of benze-neacetaldehyde was restricted to H. lactucella. Finally, Feulner et al. (2009) found (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-non-atriene (an irregular terpene) in all studied samples except in H. lactucella, H. fallacinum and P. officinarum. In a second study, Feulner et al. (2011) studied the floral scent vol-atiles of 37 Hieracium taxa by GC-MS. The analysis revealed linalool, limonene, and (E)-\u03b2-ocimene as the most abundant monoterpenes in the investigated species. Limonene was present in all samples but only in traces in H. wiesbaurianum subsp. jenzigense Bornm. et Zahn [SAN: H. hypochoeroides subsp. jenzigense (Bornm. & Zahn) Greuter], while linalool was present in all taxa except H. glaucinum subsp. oegocladum (Jord. ex Boreau) Soo\u0301 (which is not stated in the World Flora Online database unlike a similar named taxon, H. glaucinum subsp. oigocladum Soo\u0301) and H. onosmoides Fr. (E)-\u03b2-Ocimene was more widespread then its configurational isomer (Z)-\u03b2-ocimene. Both were not detected in H. bifidum subsp. basicuneatum (Zahn) Zahn, H. bifidum Kit. ex Hornem grex bifidum [NV], H. caesium Fr., H. caesium Fr. subsp. caesium [NV], H. harzianum Zahn, H. onosmoides, H. umbellatum, and H. schmidtii subsp. comatulum (Boreau) O.Bolo\u0300s & Vigo. However, (E)-\u03b2-ocimene was further only absent in H. glaucinum subsp. medium (Jord.) O.Bolo\u0300s & Vigo [SAN: H. glaucinum subsp. petiolare (Jord.) O.Bolo\u0300s & Vigo] and H. franconicum (Griseb.) Zahn. [SAN: H. glaucomorphum subsp. franconicum (Griseb.) Greuter], while the occurrence of (Z)-\u03b2-ocimene was mostly restricted to H. euwiesbaurianiforme (Schack & Zahn) Jochen M\u00fcll [SAN: H. hypochoeroides subsp. wiesbaurianiforme Greuter], and H. laevigatum Willd. [AN], as well as traces in H. bupleuroides C.C.Gmel. subsp. bupleuroides [NCT], H. franconicum, H. glaucinum subsp. medium, H. vulgatum Fr. [SAN: H. lachenalii C.C.Gmel. s.l.], H. wiesbaurianum subsp. apertorum Bornm. & Schack ex Zahn [SAN: H. hypochoeroides subsp. apertorum (Zahn) Greuter], and H. wiesbaurianum subsp. jenzi-gense. \u03b2-Pinene was also widespread in the investigated taxa, however the authors detected noteworth amounts (i.e. of more than 3% relative amounts) of the monoterpene only in the following species: H. bupleur-oides subsp. bupleuroides, H. caesium Fr. subsp. caesium, H. franconicum, H. glaucinum grex cinerascens (Jord.) Zahn [NCT], H. glaucinum subsp. Table 3 Phenolic composition of the different reviewed species of Pilosella Hill.

Other than that, the authors detected \u03b3-terpinene, (E)-linalool oxide (furanoid), (Z)-linalool oxide (furanoid), (E)-linalool oxide (pyranosid), (Z)-linalool oxide (pyranosid), verbe-none, terpinolene, \u03b1-terpineol, myrthenal, and carvone. Except (E)-lia-nolool oxide furanosid in H. bupleuroides subsp. bupleuroides and H. wiesbaurianum subsp. arnoldianum Zahn [NCT], those compounds were detected in rather low relative amounts (not more than 3%) if present in the samples. Feulner et al. (2011) further reported 29 sesquiterpenes of which 17 remained unidentified. \u03b1-Copaene, the most abundant sesquiterpene, was present in all investigated species. Silphin-1-ene was not detected in H. bupleuroides subsp. bupleuroides, H. glaucinum subsp. medium, H. glaucinum subsp. prasiophaeum, H. lachenalii, and H. murorum subsp. sylvularum (Boreau) Zahn, while \u03b1-isocomene was absent H. lachenalii, and H. murorum subsp. sylvularum. Other detected sesquiter-penes comprised (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b3-amorphene, thujopsene, aro-madendrene, allo-aromadendrene, \u03b3-gurjunene, germacrene d, \u03b1-muurolene, \u03b1-cedrene, \u03b1-selinene, \u03b2-selinene (most likely in the second part of the table wrongly stated as \u03b1-selinene), \u03b3-cadiene, \u03b4-cadiene, and lilial, which however were mostly present in low amounts of less than 2%. (E)-4,8-Dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene was detec-ted in all studied species. In addition, the authors detected a total of five benzenoids, i.e. p-methylanisole, that was restricted to low amounts in H. franconicum and H. glaucum subsp. isaricum (Na\u0308geli ex J. Hofm.)

Bioactivities The literature research provided reports on bioactivities of Hieracium and Pilosella species that comprise investigations on the antidiabetic (Table 6), anti-inflammatory (Table 7), antimicrobial (Table 8), anti-oxidant (Table 9), antiviral (Table 10), cytotoxic and antiproliferative (Table 11), diuretic (Table 12), and gastroprotective (Table 13) activ-ities. In addition, in Table 14 reports of investigations on bioactivites that cannot be linked to reported ethnopharmaceutical usage are compiled. The reviewed literature comprised both in vitro and in vivo testing, with the latter being mostly restricted to investigations on the anti-inflammatory, diuretic, and gastroprotective activities. 5.1. Antidiabetic activity Efforts to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes are an urgent public health priority with health, social, and economic benefits (Aziz et al., 2015). Plants continue to play an important role in the treatment of diabetes, particularly in developing countries where most people have limited resources and do not have access to modern treatment (Ali et al., 2006). Go\u0308kbulut et al. (2017) studied the antidiabetic capacity of Table 5 Flavonoid composition of the different studied species of Pilosella Hill. The solvents used to prepare the extracts are, as follows: CH3OH: methanol; (CH3)2CO: acetone; H2O: distilled water; CH2Cl2: dichloromethane; n-BuOH: n-butanol; C2H5OH: ethanol; (C2H5)2O: diethyl ether; C4H8O2: ethyl ethanoate.

Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446529nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treat acute inflammatory disor-ders, these conventional drugs have not been successfully administred to cure chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis nor atopic dermatitis (Kim et al., 2004). Bae et al. (2013) studied in an in vivo model the effect of an ethanolic extract of a nine-plants mixture con-taining H. albiflorum on allergic skin inflammation while understanding the underlying mechanism. Therefore, mice were sensitizied by either TMA or OVA and several parameters (earthickness, serum IgE levels; IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 secreted from splenocytes) were evaluated. Additionally, splenocytes of OVA-sensitizied mice were treated with each plant extract separately to evaluate the IC50 of IL-4 as well as the ratio of IFN-\u03b3/IL-4. While both treatment regimes comprised a solvent control group (OVA: saline and 2.5% ethanol; TMA: acetone and iso-propyl myristate (4:1, v/v)), the usage of prednisolone as a positive control was restricted to sensitization with TMA. NPM-9 significantly decreased serum IgE production in TMA treated mice, IL-1\u03b2 in the ear tissure and IL-4 as well as IL-1\u03b2, both secreted from splenocytes. Treatment with NPM-9 of OVA sensitized mice led to significantly decreased OVA-specific IgE as well as IL-4, whereas IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 significantly increased. IL-10 values of the NMP-9 treated mice did not significantly differ from na\u00efve and untreated groups. Treatment of splenocytes from OVA sensitized mice with the ethanolic extract of H. albiflorum displayed an IC50 = 208 \u03bcg/mL, thus being the second least active out of the tested extracts, while the resulting IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio was also the second lowest (together with turmeric which displayed the same ratio). However, the authors did not state the concentrations tested ex vivo. The authors concluded that NPM-9 supresses the T-helper cells 2 mediated allergic response, which they assumed is linked to a possible induction of T-helper cells 1. Additionally, the authors stated that the natural product mixture (NPM-9) has been patented in Korea (Patent number 10\u20131141191). Another in vivo study carried out by Petrovic\u0301 et al. (2008) analysed the anti-inflammatory activity of H. gymnocephalum Griseb. ex Pant. extracts (aerial blooming parts/CH2Cl2) by means of the reduction of the carrageenan induced edema in rats\u2019 paw. The authors observed anti-inflammatory effects of 5.9, 11.7, 31.2 and 44.1% at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The authors stated that the highest doses were comparable to the effects of indomethacin, which was applied as reference. In a previous study, the triterpenols \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin were isolated from the chloroform extract of the aerial parts of H. gymnocephalum (Petrovic\u0301 et al., 1999a) which were found to possess anti-inflammatory activity (Akihisa et al., 1996). Thus, the authors concluded that the triterpenols were the cause of the anti-inflammatory activity. Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2020) tested three Hieracium species in the carrageenan-induced localised inflammation model in rats. The dichloromethane extract of H. scheppiginaum Freyn and the pretreated methanol extract of H. glabratum Willd. (according to The Plant List H. glabratum Willd. ex Froel.) both achieved antihyperalgesic effects of more than 50% (calculated on the averaged differences observed in the control group) at the highest tested dose (200 mg/kg p.o.). Both extracts did not influence the motoric ability as tested in the rotarod test in rats (in the dose 200 mg/kg p.o.) and proved to be non-toxic in mice in a two-week span after administering oraly the tenfold of the dosis used to investigate the antihyperalgesic effect. The effective dose of H. scheppigianum was determined as ED50 = 163.0 \u00b1 26.5 mg/kg, the one of H. glabratum as ED50 = 211.6 \u00b1 70.6 mg/kg. The third tested extract, derived from the aerial flowering parts of H. calophyllum R.Uechtr., was less active (38.1%). Ibuprofene was used as a reference drug (100 mg/kg). None of the tested extracts displayed a significant reduction of the edema.

Aliyaziciog\u0306lu et al. (2019) reported on the effect of a methanolic extract of the aerial parts of P. hoppeana subsp. testimonialis [SAN: P. testimonialis (Na\u0308geli ex J.Hofm.) Gottschl.] on the NO concentration, the heme oxygenase activity in cells, and the inhibition of both COX1 and COX2. Further, typical parameters involved with inflammation such as MMP-9, JNK, TNF-\u03b1, Nrf-2, p38, IL-10 and IL-1\u03b2 were investigated by means of a Western blot. However, results of the Western blot were presented as figures, allowing only the interpretation of the overall trend: the tested extract led to an increase of the tested parameters. Only IL-1\u03b2 did not increase at the two lower tested concentrations (50, 25 \u03bcg/mL) in comparison to the negative control. Significance was not stated for the results of the Western blot. HPLC analyses of the meth-anolic extract revealed the presence of syringaldehyde (stated as shir-ingaldehyde), sinapic acid, benzoic acid, and quercetin. The authors concluded that the extract has wound healing abilities due to the demonstrated anti-inflammatory activities. Further information on the tested plant organs, extracts, tested doses and obtained results are dis-played in Table 7. 5.3. Antibacterial activity The resistance of bacteria expanded due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases. This situation has led to increased efforts in the search of new antimicrobial compounds from diverse sources including medicinal plants (Bauer et al., 1966; Chees-man et al., 2017). A variety of techniques have been reported for determining the antimicrobial activity of plant materials. The most frequently in vitro used techniques include the agar well diffusion method and the dilution method based on incorporation of plant sam-ples in the media prior to inoculation. Out of the investigated taxa, a Hieracium species (determination was performed only at the level of the genus by the authors) (Barbour et al., 2004), P. sandrasica [SAN: P. auriculoides (La\u0301ng) Arv.-Touv.] (Ugur et al., 2010) and P. officinarum Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2008); Frey and Meyers (2010); Nostro et al. (2000); Greib and Duque\u0301nois (1960); Bonomo et al. (2020) displayed antimi-crobial activity in various screenings. Further, isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, a flavonoid isolated from the flowering heads of P. officinarum, was slightly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 125 \u03bcg/mL). The antimicrobial activity of P. sandrasica focussed on an ethanolic extract while the respective chloroform extract was active against less species. The antimicrobial activity as compiled from the available literature neither focussed on gram-positive nor gram-negative strains and was not restricted to plant organs nor ex-tracts. Table 8 provides a more detailed overview about the compiled literature. Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2008) performed antimicrobial tests subjecting extracts of different polarity prepared from the whole plant of P. officinarum using the disc diffusion test. However, neither positive nor negative controls were included in this work. Frey and Meyers (2010) studied the effect of the aqueous extracts of P. officinarum using both the disc diffusion as well as a serial dilution assay. Both assays comprised sterile water as negative and ampicillin as positive controls. The line-arity of the obtained results by the serial dilution assay was demon-strated by correlation coefficients R2=0.89 for flowering heads, 0.95 for leaf extracts, and 0.63 for steam extracts. Nostro et al. (2000) investi-gated the antimicrobial activity of the leaves of P. officinarum. Extracts of different polarity were evaluated in the disc diffusion test with DMSO as negative and vancomycin, amoxicillin, and amphotericin as positive controls. The authors did not establish the MICs of compounds with a diameter of less than 12 mm in the initial testing. In the following in-vestigations Escherichia coli was noted not to be tested due to the diameter being less than 12 mm. In fact, E. coli was stated to be inactive in the initial screening unlike Proteus vulgaris which was inhibited by the diethyl ether extract (8 mm diameter inhibition zone). It seems likely that the authors confused the notification attached to E. coli with P. vulgaris. Greib and Duque\u0301nois (1960) tested the effect of aqueous extracts derived from P. officinarum against three Brucella species both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro assay, the extracts could cut the microorgan-isms\u2019 growth. The authors also found that the treatment was easily tolerated, non-toxic and effective (even in cases of chronic brucellosis) after administration to the animals. However, the authors did not state what plant organ had been extracted nor how the experiment was conducted. Finally, Bonomo et al. (2020) screened an ethanolic extract of P. officinarum. Highly active extracts were further used to establish MICs of sensitive strains. However, although the extract of P. officinarum was found effective against all gram-negative species in the initial testing, the authors investigated only MICs of gram-positive bacteria. The authors did not provide information about the extracted plant organ. In this study five strains of Lactobacillus sakei were included but did not differ in hindsight of the results, hence the summarising table does not discriminate between the strains. Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) screened isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside for its antimicrobial activity using the agar well diffusion and micro-dilution broth method. Wells containing DMSO without test compound were used as negative control, and gentamicin and fluconazole as positive controls. In an antimicrobial screening of species indigenous to Lebanon, Barbour et al. (2004) investigated a not nearer determined Hieracium species. A negative control experiment was conducted with the solvent, but the usage of a positive control was not mentioned. They further did not provide information on the incubation time. Several extracts were prepared of the aerial parts of P. sandrasica, an endemic species in Turkey, and screened using the disc diffusion method to identify can-didates that were then subjected to multiresistant strains. Although the authors used hexane, chloroform, ethanol, and ethyl acetate as negative controls, any mention is made on the positive controls employed (Ugur et al., 2010). However, further investigations on the composition of the active extracts were restricted to the chloroform extract, revealing monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpenoids (Ugur et al., 2010). For the methanolic extract prepared by Booth et al. (2012) of H. caespitosum [SAN: Pilosella caespitosa (Dumort.) P.D.Sell & C.West] the sample was weighed first and only then ground, resulting in a possibly lower concentration than stated. The concentration tested by Borchardt et al. (2008) remains unclear: after extraction of 2 mg of plant material, the solvent was evaporated to a not nearer defined concen-tration, thus limiting the comparability between the investigated plant species and other studies. 5.4. Antimycotic activity In many studies screening the antimicrobial activity of Hieracium and Pilosella extracts moulds and yeasts were included, thus providing an overview about the antimycotic range (Table 8). Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2008) studied the effect of P. officinarum extracts of different polarity on the fungi Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans using the disc diffusion test method as well as determining the corresponding MIC values. However, neither positive nor negative controls were included in this work. In the screening of extracts of P. officinarum conducted by Nostro et al. (2000) the antimycotic activity was studied. Further investigations on the respective MICs were conducted but values were not established for Fusarium oxysporum and the Penicillium species despite the earlier observed activity in the disk diffusion test. DMSO was used as negative and vancomycin, amoxicillin, and amphotericin as positive controls. Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) isolated isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside from the flowering heads of P. officinarum and subjected it to the agar well diffusion method against two yeasts species. They used DMSO without test compound as negative control and J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446531fluconazole as positive control. The Turkish species P. sandrasica was tested against two yeasts by Ugur et al. (2010). They used hexane, chloroform, ethanol, and ethyl acetate as negative controls but any mention is made on the positive control. H. umbellatum did not display an inhibition of the growth of C. albicans (Borchardt et al., 2008; Kuluev et al., 2019) as well as a hexane extract of the roots of P. echioides (Kuluev et al., 2019). 5.5. Antioxidant activity The reviewed literature on antioxidant activities of Hieracium and Pilosella species comprised a broad variety of in vitro assays based on the free radical scavenging activity (DPPH, ABTS tests), reduction of ferric ions as well as other markers of oxidative stress investigated in tests such as the \u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid assay. A complete list of all reviewed studies is compiled in Table 9. Amongst the studied species P. officinarum recieved the most attention. Especially in case of the DPPH assay differences in the methodology between studies were observed. The incubation time ranged from no incubation at all to 4 h while the temperature during the incubation varied between the studies or was not stated at all. To improve comparability, whenever possible the tested concentrations were calculated from the information stated by the authors. In addition, in case of the DPPH assay the results were altered to IC50 if synonyms of this value were stated. In only on case the authors investigated the antioxidant capacity of a single compound, isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyr-anoside, isolated from the flowering heads of P. officinarum (Gawron\u0301-ska-Grzywacz et al., 2011). In the remaining studies, crude extracts of different polarity of 39 plant species were investigated, revealing a broad range of antioxidant activity. Detailed results are stated in Table 9. 5.6. Antiviral activity Both H. umbellatum and P. officinarum were subject of in vitro studies evaluating a potential usage in the treatment of HIV. More detailed in-formation on the two studies is compiled in Table 10. Min et al. (1999) screened methanol extracts of 93 Korean plant species in vitro against the HIV-1 protease. Among the tested species was H. umbellatum, that however was not considered active due to the low inhibion of the HIV-1 protease (15.0 \u00b1 2.6%) in comparison to the other species tested. The authors performed the experiments using negative controls, i.e., the protease without any extracts, and acetyl pepstatin as positive control (50% inhibitory activity, IC50 at 29 \u03bcg/mL). A second study investigated the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of P. officinarum (Bedoya et al., 2001). The antiviral activity was evaluated using MT-2 NL 4.3 cells infected with HIV-1, simultaneously determining the cytotoxic effect of the extracts by the MTT assay. Ethanolic extracts showed marked cytotoxicity, thus preventing the testing of higher concentrations. The aqueous extract of P. officinarum was neither cytotoxic in the evaluated concentration (0\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL) nor did the extract show any antiviral effect against HIV. The authors did not state whether they conducted control experiments nor what plant organ was extracted, although they mentioned that plants were collected during the flowering season. It should be noted that although the authors stated 500 \u03bcg/mL as highest tested concentration in case of P. officinarum the highest tested con-centration appears to be 200 \u03bcg/mL. 5.7. Cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities Substantial research has been directed towards discovering com-pounds with cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities that might be endowed with potential chemopreventive or anticancer applications (Twilley et al., 2020). The antiproliferative effect of isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside isolated from P. officinarum flowering heads by Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) was assayed in vitro in two human tumor cell lines derived from lung (A549) and colon (HT-29). Cells were exposed to either the culture medium (negative control) or the tested flavonoid (1\u2013100 \u03bcM) for 96 h and their proliferation was determined by means of the MTT method. In case of the HT-29 cell culture, the pro-liferation was significantly decreased (10\u2013100 \u03bcM) in a non-dose dependent manner (p < 0.05). Proliferation of A549 cells was not affected by up to 25 \u03bcM, however at the highest concentrations (50 and 100 \u03bcM) a significant increase was observed (p < 0.05). The screening of plant extracts in search of candidates for the treatment of HIV by Bedoya et al. (2001) included the evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of the ex-tracts. The aqueous extract of P. officinarum was considered non-toxic in the tested range (0\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL) while all investigated ethanolic extracts displayed pronounced cytotoxic activity against MT-2 cells. However, the authors did not state what plant organ was extracted. Le Coguic and Seralini (2019) evaluated a multi component nutraceutical containing amongst other P. officinarum in three different cell lines (HEK 293, HepG2, and JEG-3) in a MTT assay. Of the three tested cell lines only JEG-3 cells were affected by concentrations of more than 0.2%, resulting in significantly decreased viability. While the viability of the cells was calculated using untreated cells, a positive control was not mentioned. In an additionally conducted bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation ELISA assay the nutraceutical containing P. officinarum was not included. The methanolic extract of the whole plant of H. caespitosum [SAN: P. caespitosa (Dumort.) P.D.Sell & C.West] was mildy active in another in vitro experiment against HeLa cells. The authors calculated a LC50 of 0.67 mg/mL by the least squares regression at doses from 0.6 to 0.06 mg/mL (Booth et al., 2012) and hence the value appears to be extrapolated. Tris buffer was used as a negative control in this work. Aliyaziciog\u0306lu et al. (2019) subjected HT29 and L9N29 cells to the methanolic extract of P. hoppeana subsp. testimonialis. The problematic of the identity of this subspecies has been pointed out above. Treatment in the range of 12.5\u2013250 \u03bcg/mL did not reduce the viability more than 25%. It seems that the authors mixed up the order in which the results were stated as the highest tested concentration resulted in the highest viability in both tested cell lines. For more information, see Table 11. Investigations on the cytoxic activity remain scarce so far. However, especially the findings of Bedoya et al. (2001) indicate that the kind of preparations, i.e., the way of extraction, might influence the cytotoxic effect. Nevertheless, as already pointed out above, reports about side effects of the usage of P. officinarum preparations are limited to one single note. 5.8. Diuretic activity Diuresis is the increased volume of urine depending on high levels of excrete sodium. Most diuretics produce diuresis by inhibiting the reab-sorption of sodium at different segments of the renal tubular system. The number of studies investigating the diuretic activity was restricted to three reports. An in vivo study by Beaux et al. (1999) investigated the diuretic effect of an ethanolic extract of P. officinarum aerial parts after the intra-peritoneal administration of two doses (50 and 200 mg/kg animal) in rats during the following 2\u201324 h. The negative controls were treated with hypotonic saline solution, while positive controls received hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg). Unfortunately, the authors did not state in what unit the secreted volume of the urine was measured. Another in vivo study by Canello et al. (2017) performed a clinical evaluation on the effect of a nutraceutical diet enriched with plants (with P. officinarum as the most abundant in a 5-plants mixture) applied to 33 cats suffering from cystitis with evident hematuria, dysuria and/or stranguria. The trial lasted 30 days. The authors obtained a significant restoration of the urine color, turbidity, pH, RBC, WBC, as well as a significant urine weight and protein decrease and a significant decrease of struvite uroliths in all treated cats at the end of the treatment. How-ever, they did not employ positive nor negative controls in this study and the comparisons were made before and after the treatment over the same group of animals. Further missing were statements on the J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446532extracted plant organs and the extraction solvent. Information on the actually carried out feeding regime were missing as well as the authors refer to the instructions of the supplier without providing sufficient in-formation to comprehend that aspect. It was not investigated how the single compounds of the mixture contribute to the observed effects. Perna et al. (2020) investigated the effects of a supplement containing an undefined extract of P. officinarum on the bloating sensation and hydration in women. Participants took the mixture diluted in water each morning and results were evaluated after 30 and 60 days. The hydration improved significantly, while the bloating sensation was not signifi-cantly improved. Interestingly, according to the composition as stated in the supplementary data the P. officinarum extract contains the flavonoid vitexin, a derivative of apigenin, which was so far not reported from this taxon. The study was rather small with no more than 19 participants and did not include a placebo or negative group. The complex mixture of the supplement does not allow to interpretate the contribution of single extracts. More detailed information on the discussed studies is provided in Table 12. For better understanding the differences between T0 and T1 as obtained by Canello et al. (2017) were calculated. 5.9. Gastroprotective activity Ulcers are a usual illness of the gastrointestinal tract. They are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Classical approaches to treat them involve a combination of PPI and antibiotics. Petrovic\u0301 et al. (2008) analysed the gastroprotective activity of H. gymnocephalum Gri-seb. ex Pant. extract (aerial blooming parts/CH2Cl2) using the in vivo experimental model of indomethacine-induced gastric mucosa lesions. Rats that received the extract of H. gymnocephalum (200 mg/kg p.o.) displayed a reduction of lesions (40% less animals with lesions), as well as significantly reduced gastric damage, lesion area and length of gastric lesions (p < 0.05 vs control). An anti-inflammatory effect (p < 0.01 vs control) was also observed. DMSO was used to treat the control group but no positive control was included. In earlier conducted studies (Pet-rovic\u0301 et al., 1999a), \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin, triterpene alcohols that possess anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective effects (Akihisa et al., 1996; Navarrete et al., 2002), were isolated from the chloroform extract of the aerial parts of H. gymnocephalum. Hence, the authors concluded that these compounds could be responsible for the reduced symptoms observed in the study. Testing conditions are compiled in Table 13. 5.10. Antiepileptic activity Epilepsy can be caused by imbalance in the GABAnergic system. The GABAA receptor, which is involved in epilepsy, has a binding site for compounds, such as benzodiazepines (Stafford et al., 2005). Thus, a way to determine the antiepileptic potential of plant extracts is to test for affinity to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor, which en-hances the receptor sensitivity for endogenous GABA, preventing epileptic incidences (Ja\u0308ger et al., 2006). Ja\u0308ger et al. (2006) tested 42 species traditionally used in the Danish folk medicine to treat epilepsy and convulsions in a flumazenil-binding assay. Total and unspecific binding was determined with buffer or diazepam (1 M, final concen-tration in assay). In comparison to other tested species (Primula elatior Hill, P. veris L. and Tanacetum parthenium Sch.Bip.) the binding of the tested P. officinarum extracts was rather low. However, the ethanolic extracts was slightly more active than the aqueous. Detailed information is provided in Table 14. 5.11. Hypotensive activity Hypertension is a major contributor to blood vessels\u2013related diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, and congestive heart failure (Mantero and Boscaro, 1992). Marked hypo-tensive effect was obtained by some extracts from Bulgarian P. officinarum (Petkov, 1986). However, the approach used to study this activity (including controls), the kind of extracts, dose-range tested, effective concentrations and measurements on activity were not mentioned in this work. 5.12. Anti-obesity activity According to the World Health Organisation, 65% of the world\u2019s population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight (World Health Organization, 2011) becoming a first-order problem. Lee et al. (2012) screened the lipase inhibitory activity in vitro of methanol extracts from 560 different medicinal plant species, including H. umbellatum. Amounts of oleic acid produced in the enzymatic conversion of triolein by the porcine pancreatic lipase (Type II) were measured to determine the inhibitory activity of the plant ex-tracts. In comparison to the most active species (Desmodium oxyphyllum DC., with 74.2 \u00b1 0.4%) H. umbellatum showed a relatively high activity with 49.8 \u00b1 0.5%. However, there is no mention of the use of control groups (positive or negative) in this work. Table 14 provides more detailed information. 5.13. Arthropodicidal activities with applications in veterinary and agriculture In a screening of medicinal plant species the methanol extract of the whole plant of an undetermined Hieracium species (collected in Kneis-seh, Lebanon) significantly lowered the number of alive nymphs of the Cotton Whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, 1889), (Hammad et al., 2014). Treatment with the extract of the Hieracium species led to oozing in the nymphs, indicating a toxic effect. However, the extract was ineffective against adult whiteflies. A slight acaricidal activity of methanol extracts was reported by Hammad et al. (2017). The extract of the whole plant from another unidentified Hieracium species collected in Kneisseh (Lebanon) led to a mortality of Tetranychus urticae Koch, 1836 adult mites. This was about half of the strength in comparison to the most active extract (Lotus carmeli Boiss., whole plant, 43.6 \u00b1 8.4% mortality). Both studies used 10% methanol or distilled water in control groups. Information on both studies are compiled in Table 14. 5.14. Global periorbital skin rejuvenation To counter the signs of aging affecting the area around the eye Colvan et al. (2019) investigated whether the daily application of a cosmetic cream containing low molecular weight heparan sulfates and plant extracts bettered the overall appearance. Amongst other the formulation contained low amounts of an undefined extract of P. officinarum. However, the number of participants (n = 15) was rather low, and it was not evaluated how each component of the cosmetic cream contributed to the observed effects, thus not allowing for an interpretation of the activity exerted by P. officinarum. Results are stated in more detail in Table 14. 5.15. Reduction of ruminal ammonia High amounts of ammonia due to the intake of crude protein can stress the metabolism of cows (Kapp-Bitter et al., 2020). An in vitro study investigated whether the intake of plant species could lower the amount of ammonia formation in the rumen, assuming that high amounts of tannins could prevent the crude protein from being decomposed (Kapp-Bitter et al., 2020). It needs to be noted that the values were established for the tested plant species as part of a mixture of plants. Additionally, the plant species were characterized with regard to pa-rameters evaluating the nutrient value that was estimated as the IVOMD as well as the basic chemical composition thus providing data on the content of condensed tannins, non-tannin phenols, total extractable phenols, and total tannis. All three values significantly differed from the respective results achieved by the basal mixture. The authors observed a J. Willer et al.

Further information and results are stated in Table 14. 5.16. Toxicological data In Dioscorides Renovado (Font Quer, 1981) it is stated that the use of H. pilosella (SAN= P. officinarum) has the advantage of being innocuous. According to this author \u2018the plant lacks toxicity for humans and does not even act on the intestinal flora of the healthy person\u2019. In this regard, Greib and Duque\u0301nois (1960) reported that this species\u2019 aqueous extract could be administered to animals without any sign of toxicity or lesion for several months. Recently, Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2020) demonstrated that within two weeks after orally administering high doses (2000 mg/kg) of extracts derived from H. scheppigianum and H. glabratum the behaviour of the tested mice did not alter, nor lead to any signs of toxicity. We could not find any other work concerning the toxicity of the memebers of Hieracium and Pilosella. The only reported case of side ef-fects was on a 34-year-old-woman that referred to have developed a macular\u2013papular eruption involving the face, neck, arms, and trunk, after a twelve-day treatment for slimming with a tincture made from a mixture composed by P. officinarum (Tognetti et al., 2011). However, the authors related the adverse effect to other added compounds in the preparation. 6. Discussion 6.1. - On the pre-Linnean attributions to the Hieracium and Pilosella uses and properties In spite of the references to some Hieracium species before the Linnean nomenclature (e.g. H. majus, H. minus, H. parvum) the iconog-raphies and descriptions found in these texts (Fig. 1) seem not to correspond to the current idea of Hieracium, introduced by Linnaeus (1753). Fuchs (1557) attributed the properties of the Dioscorides\u2019 Hieracium parvum most likely to Taraxacum sp. according to the description made and the illustrations provided as this H. parvum pos-sesses deeply divided leaves, with acute leaflets. Also, the mentions of Hieracium in the Dioscorides De Materia Medica (and annotations made by Laguna) seem not to correspond to the Linnean and current idea of this genus\u2019 species as Laguna mentioned that people named H. minus \u2018dandelion\u2019 among other herbs (Chondrilla, Hedypnois and Taraxacum). According to this, we think that H. minus could be a synonym of H. parvum and both of them can be, more likely, attributed to the current Taraxacum genus. On the contrary, the Pilosella species mentioned by Lonitzer (1551) such as P. major and P. minor could be attributed to current taxa of this genus attending to the described morphological characters and the drawn icononographies. However, the specific cor-respondence between these binomens and the currently accepted taxa is difficult to determine with these materials and therefore, the medicinal properties cannot be stated. 6.2. - Limitations of the ethnopharmacological compilation and phytochemical research Out of the more than 850 estimated species of Hieracium and Pilo-sella, references to their traditional uses have been only reported from 34 of them. This can be very surprising at first but there are several reasons that may explain the limited ethnopharmacological compilation. The first reason is related to the high degree of polymorphism in the group, that implies difficulties in understanding and identifiying the tax-onomical diversity of Hieracium and Pilosella at the level of species. Na\u0308geli and Peter (1885, 1886\u20131889) and Zahn (1921\u20131923) distin-guished \u2018basic species\u2019 (Hauptarten) defined as being morphologically unique, from \u2018intermediate species\u2019 (Zwischenarten), which share the morphological characters and combine traits of two or more basic spe-cies and are thought to have hybrid origin. This approach significantly contributed to the understanding of the complex. However, an innu-merable number of subspecies, varieties and forms affiliated to both basic and intermediate species (either originated by mutations or hy-bridization processes) has been described. This fact, in turn, opened a complex taxonomical scenario where difficult consensus on the diversity scheme has been traditionally present. The first consequence of this situation would be the identification problem at the level of species in certain taxa with ethnopharmacological interests that can be observed in the literature reviewed in this work (San Miguel, 2004; Aceituno, 2010; Mustafa et al., 2012; Gonzales de la Cruz et al., 2014; Hammad et al., 2014) and the checked electronic databases. The authors also wonder whether these difficulties have sometimes motivated the exclusion of Hieracium and Pilosella taxa in ethnobiological inventories or publica-tions as reported for other challenging genera (Bebber et al., 2007; Va\u0301zquez, 2008). The second consequence of this strong level of tax-onomical diversification in both genera is the high degree of rare and Table 9 (continued ) Species Organ Extraction solvent/ Specialised metabolite Test Model Incubation Concentration Results Reference DPPH scavenging activity n.s.

Medicinal plants must be abundant and easy to recognize and harvest as rare species are difficult to find (Leonti, 2011). Therefore, only the most common and widespread Hieracium and Pilosella species (such as P. officinarum, H. murorum, H. umbellatum, etc.) are likely to take part of the popular knowledge and pharmacopoeias as we found in this review. Rare and restricted endemic species (which constitute an important group in Hieracium and Pilosella) are therefore not likely to take part of this body of knowledge. Furthermore, the genus concept in Hieracium-Pilosella has had different interpretations in the generic and sub-generic circumscription over the years and references to certain taxa such as P. officinarum, H. murorum, H. pannosum, H. umbellatum, and H. venosum (among others) might not really corre-spond to the current adscription of the species or the genus. For instance, H. virosum was mentioned to be used in Spain (Table 1). However, H. virosum sensu stricto is absent from all Central and Western Europe, including Spain (http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/) and, Table 12 Compiled studies conducted on the diuretic activity of Pilosella species.

Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446543therefore, this reference has to be treated with caution. Ideally, it would be of great ethnopharmacological interests to confirm the currently taxonomical adscription of the taxon considered in this reference. Beyond the species level, references found on Hieracium taxa that currently correspond to different genera were excluded from the compilation here presented, but the most interesting for the aim of this review are further commented. Also, the plant species investigated by Koleckar et al. (2008) named H. cespitosa is most likely a typo and hence should correspond to H. caespitosum [SAN: P. caespitosa (Dumort.) P.D.Sell & C.West]. How-ever, the same study also included P. caespitosa and results given for both species are in the same range which makes us think both specimens correspond to the same taxon. Finally, the loss of traditional knowledge on uses of plants is a recognised general problem in ethnopharmacology (Quave et al., 2012). This may also influence the surprisingly low number of references in the Hieracium and Pilosella traditional uses, as we reviewed. For instance, Cozzo (2004) compiled that the medicinal use of H. gronovii was already forgotten by the Cherokee indians when the research was carried out. Also, Vitalini et al. (2015) stated that the use of P. officinarum to heal wounds in Alta Valtellina is documented but already abandoned in Lombard Stelvio National Park (Italy). In this regard, it would be of great ethnopharmacological interest to perform specific questions focussed on Hieracium and Pilosella taxa when per-forming ethnobotanical fieldwork campaigns, in order to record valu-able local uses in understudied regions, thus avoiding their lose as it has been commented above. Furthermore, it would be also beneficial to verify which uses are in current practice in the more prospected terri-tories. Finally, an effort to determine what currently accepted taxon the used specimens correspond to would be desirable in order to gain consistent data. If we analyse the geographical component in the traditional usage of Hieracium and Pilosella species in folk medicine, we find references from all continents in the world (except Australia, where they are not native). A vast array of uses is circumscribed to the European countries and this is most probably the reason why P. officinarum is present in the British and French Pharmacopoeias. Several references to the popular use of Hieracium and Pilosella are also circumscribed to the Russian territory such as P. officinarum, H. murorum, H. echioides, H. umbellatum and H. pilosum. However, none of these species is present in the Russian Pharmacopoeia (Shikov et al., 2014). Another question that would be interesting to resolve is to which extent the current popular use of P. officinarum is, in fact, linked to the ancestral traditional use of this species in a given region or whether it was influenced or incorporated from foreign traditions in the last centuries as a result of medical text translations since the Middle Age as documented for Japan (Gordon--Cumming, 1887). It seems reasonable to think that P. officinarum has a long tradition of medicinal uses in Central and Southern Europe as revealed in the literature research here performed. However, how traditional its use is in other regions where we found references (such as Russia or another Slavic countries, Asiaand America) seems unclear. We also found some gaps as far as the phytochemical composition concerns. Phenolic compounds and flavonoids are quite well investi-gated in these genera, specially in Central Europe and the Balkans (see Tables 2\u20135). However, most species from other areas (such as the Iberian Peninsula or Turkey) are still not investigated in spite of their richness in Hieracium and Pilosella. If we take into consideration other specialised metabolites (coumarines, sesquiterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, etc.) the current scientific knowledge is rather limited. For instance, eudes-manolides were reported to be often predominant in Hieracium and Pilosella, whereas guaianolides were dominant in Crepis (Zidorn, 2008). However, a more recent study performed by Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2018a) showed that guaianolides were also dominant in 28 Hieracium species from the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, future research lines should be focused on non-phenolic compounds in order to describe newly identi-fied chemical constituents and for a better understanding of the chem-ical diversity within these genera. 6.3. - Experimental data to support traditional usage and their correlation to the chemical composition The first experimental evidence both in vitro and in vivo attempting to support traditional use is found in the diuretic activity for which, moreover, the responsible constituents are quite clearly identified, as we discuss beneath. However, the number of studies is still low and they present some gaps in order to conclude that diuretic activity is well proven. Research on the diuretic capacity of P. officinarum performed by Beaux et al. (1999) related it to the ability of increasing the urine flux. This property seems to be the reason why this species has been also traditionally used to successfully treat different ailments and/or in-flammations of the urinary system including prostate and renal ones (Efremov and Shreter, 1996; Redz\u030cic\u0301, 2007; Popovic\u0301 et al., 2014), to treat obesity, to slim (Hurrell and Puentes, 2013; Becker et al., 2017; de Freitas and de Almeida, 2017) and to resorb ascetic effusions of cardiac origin (Guarino et al., 2008). The diuretic activity of P. officinarum has been related to its content in polyphenolic acids (particularly caffeic and chlorogenic acids), tannins, and flavonoids (Moro and Basile, 2000). As P. officinarum, practically all Hieracium and Pilosella chemically studied produce these compounds (Tables 2\u20135) and this may certainly explain why other species have diuretic properties or are reported to be helpful in urinary diseases treatment in the folk medicine. Examples compiled in this review are H. fendleri (Shemluck, 1982), H. murorum (Hapayev and Hapayeva, 2015), H. umbellatum (Kim et al., 2006), and H. venosum (Cozzo, 2004). However, none of them were tested to verify their sup-posed diuretic activity and it could be interesting to screen whether these taxa show stronger diuretic activity than P. officinarum. In any case, although diuretic properties of P. officinarum are pointed out experimentally, it would be helpful to perform specific studies and clinical trials to completely support this traditional use and to under-stand the specific way that it helps in other urinary tract diseases. Another traditional use supported by experimental research is the anti-inflammatory one, according to the reviewed literature. Dom-browicz et al. (1992) related the use of P. officinarum to treat in-flammations of the upper parts of the respiratory tract to the presence of salicylic acid. H. gymnocephalum tested by Petrovic\u0301 et al. (2008) showed significant anti-inflammatory effects and the authors related this prop-erty to the presence of triterpene alcohols (as \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin, as well as taraxasterol derivative) found in previous studies. However, the authors did not specifically test these compounds to verify that the triterpene alcohols are the active principles within H. gymnocephalum, exerting the anti-inflammatory activity of this species. In inflammations originated by allergic disorders H. albiflorum was very effective to treat them ac-cording to Bae et al. (2013). However, this species was not chemically investigated. In any case, chemical differences in natural compounds responsible of the anti-inflammatory activity (presumably salicylic acid and triterpene alcohols) should be further determined. Also, a more-in-depth research on this topic conducted in other species tradi-tionally used as anti-inflammatory (but still lacking tests on bioactivity and thorough investigations of their chemophenetic profile) such as H. amplexicaule (Gonza\u0301lez-Tejero, 1989) and H. umbellatum (Hapayev and Hapayeva, 2015) will be helpful to characterize the potential use of Hieracium and Pilosella species to support their suitability to treat in-flammations. Unlike the results compiled in this review, Hwang et al. (2014) obtained very low anti-inflammatory activity in H. coreanum extracts. However, H. coreanum is currently adscribed to Crepis coreana (Nakai) H.S.Pak. Crepis species lack apigenin and quercetin unlike Hieracium and Pilosella (Man\u0303ez et al., 1994). As both quercetin (Tian et al., 2021) and apigenin (Ginwala et al., 2019) were reported to have strong anti-infammatory activities, the above mentioned differences might be explained by the chemophenetical differences between the genera Crepis and Hieracium-Pilosella. While antimycotic activities were observed only in the ethanolic extract of P. sandrasica (Ugur et al., 2010), as well as in some extracts of P. officinarum (Nostro et al., 2000; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008), several Hieracium and Pilosella extracts J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446544demonstrated antibacterial activities. Dombrowicz et al. (1992) related this property to the high abundance of caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid in P. officinarum. Various ethnopharmacological references mentioned the usage of preparations derived from P. officinarum as antiobiotics (So\u0303ukand and Raal, 2008; Agelet et al., 2000; Bonet et al., 1999). Ac-cording to Font Quer (1981) P. officinarum was used to treat brucellosis, a sickness triggered by Brucella species. The findings of Greib and Duque\u0301nois (1960) support this application as all three tested Brucella species were affected by the treatment with P. officinarum. The observed activites of the extracts of P. officinarum were not restricted to certain plant organs or polartity ranges making the contribution of various compound classes to the antimicrobial effect likely. In addition, Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) related this property to the flavonoid isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside for the same species. These compiled evidences may be helpful to support the high number of references on the traditional uses of P. officinarum as vulnerary and to treat different types of bacterial and fungal infections, both internally and externally (Table 1). However, specific investigations on antibacterial activity of these species should be performed in order to verify their traditional uses. In addition, active principles exerting such activity were generally not identified in Hieracium and Pilosella species. Several authors considered whether flavonoids and terpenes present within P. officinarum might hold responsible for the antimicrobial action of this species\u2019 extracts due to interference with membrane constituents but performed no further testing (Bonomo et al., 2020; Nostro et al., 2020; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008). Finally, Barbour et al. (2004) did not provide information on the composition of the methanolic extract of the unde-termined Hieracium species they investigated in an antibacterial testing. Based on a literature research they related the observed antibacterial activity to a germacranolide as well as hydroxyenzyl alcohol derivatives, previously isolated from H. murorum (Zidorn et al., 2001). However, as Barbour et al. (2004) did not determine the species of the investigated taxon this allocation should be treated with caution. The compiled literature also reported activity against two yeasts (C. albican, C. tropialis), two Aspergillus species as well as F. oxysporum, and an un-determined species of Penicillium. However, none of the studies con-ducted further investigations on the composition of the extracts or active principles but it was mentioned that contained flavonoids and terpenes could interfere with the cell membrane and thus were cytotoxic (Nostro et al., 2000; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008). According to Agelet et al. (2000) P. officinarum was used in Catalonia, Spain, as an antimycotic preparation. A remarkable effort has been done in estimating the antioxidant capacity of Hieracium and Pilosella species during the last two decades (Table 9). These species\u2019 extracts have been related to antioxidant properties in several kind of extractants and plant organs according to the assays performed so far, particulatly for P. officinarum (Fraisse et al., 2011; Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al., 2011; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008; 2009; Woo et al., 2010), P. hoppeana subsp. testimonialis, H. bornmuelleri (Bakar et al., 2015), H. pannosum (Go\u0308kbulut et al., 2017), H. cappadocicum (Tepe et al., 2006), H. glabratum, H. mirificissimum, and H. naegelianum extracts (Milutinovic\u0301 et al., 2018b). In most cases, the antioxidant power was attributed to the high phenolic contents, mainly chlorogenic acid and flavonoids (Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008; Fraisse et al., 2011; Bakar et al., 2015; Milutinovic\u0301 et al., 2018b) such as isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al., 2011). In contrast, Woo et al. (2010) did not find correlation between phenolic composition and antioxidant activity. However, the main gap concern-ing all these studies is that all of them were only set up on chemical assays, based on redox reactions performed in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, etc.) and none of them carried out additional enzymatic assays as well as in vivo models. Although these in vitro tests suggest the antioxidant ca-pacity of the studied extracts, due to the lack of more accurate in vitro test and in vivo experiments we cannot assume the experimental support of the antioxidant bioactivity and its subsequent therapeutic efficacy (Kasote et al., 2015). Moreover, although phenolic compounds and flavonoids may exert protective activities against abiotic (Zidorn et al., 2005) and biotic (Kulbat, 2016) stresses in plants, it is also not proven that these compounds might act in the same way in humans (Harnly, 2017; Kasote et al., 2015), thus making it quite risky to correlate phenolic compounds and health promoting properties due to the anti-oxidant activity as demonstrated in vitro. Therefore, a more compre-hensive research on antioxidant activity (including in vivo studies) would be beneficial in order to consider these species as promising antioxidant agents. Antidiabetic activity was found for H. pannosum extracts in Go\u0308kbulut et al. (2017). However, there is no record of traditional uses to treat diabetes for this species. On the contrary, P. officinarum was traditionally used in Montenegro to treat diabetes (Menkovic\u0301 et al., 2011) but experimental data to support this activity is lacking for this species. Also, the natural product responsible for this activity is still unknown. The cytotoxic activity of H. caespitosum was determined by Booth et al. (2012) but it was not related to any metabolite in particular. This is not the case of the compound isoetin 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside isolated from P. officinarum inflorescences by Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) that showed a marked antiproliferative effect in colon cancer cell lines, thus supporting what Astrologova and Feklistov (2002) found on traditional uses to treat tumors with P. officinarum and H. umbellatum in Russia. However, Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al. (2011) did not include any other cell lines than these two cancer lines. In any case, the results are not considered to be outstanding in order to be further evaluated as lead anti-cancer agent when comparing to other compounds isolated from plants (e.g. celastrol, taxol). Gastroprotective properties were found in H. gymnocephalum by Petrovic\u0301 et al. (2008) and it was related to the presence of triterpene alcohols. However, we could not find any traditional use of this species in this field of application. In contrast, references on traditional uses to treat gastric ulcers (among other related illnesses in the digestive apparatus comprised P. officinarum, H. amplexicaule (Gonza\u0301lez-Tejero, 1989), H. maculatum (Barnaulov and Barnaulov, 2018), H. murorum (Hapayev and Hapayeva, 2015), H. tandilense (Barboza et al., 2009) and H. umbellatum (Kim et al., 2006)). Therefore, it would be interesting to include these species in further studies aimed to test the gastroprotective bioactivities and subsequently identify the responsible compounds. P. officinarum decoction in wine was documented by Ja\u0308ger et al. (2006) to be useful against epilepsy. In this regard, reported anti-epileptic activity of P. officinarum was modest (Table 14). Also, the traditional use of H. staticifolium as antiepileptic was also reported in old traditional Danish medicine (Adams et al., 2012) but this taxon is currently adscribed to Tolpis staticifolia (All.) Sch.Bip. and thus, excluded from the compilation here presented. In any case, responsible com-pounds were not studied. Therefore, further studies would be necessary to clarify this point. Finally, anti-obesity and acaricidal activities were also modest (Table 14). Moreover, little evidence is provided to the antiviral and hypotensive activities found in P. officinarum (Tables 10 and 14, respectively). In addition, there is a complete lack of experimental information in order to prove some of the supposed properties here compiled from popular uses of P. officinarum such as the emetic, laxative, haemostatic, aperient, tonic or stimulant, or to treat bone fracture, joint problems, hernia and jaundice. As the traditional use against certain illness does not mean that they have clinical effect, it would be very interesting to perform scientific research in order to verify that these plants possess the compiled properties or, on the contrary, they are simply used for tradition. In the first case, it would be also ideal to understand what chemical compounds are responsible of these proven activities. 6.4. - Methodological considerations on the studies of bioactivities The revision on studies investigating Hieracium and Pilosella bio-activities demonstrated that most research was designed as in vitro J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446545testing. Particularly the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities revealed higher number of studies, while the other activities such as antidiabetic, antiviral, diuretic or gastroprotective activities received less attention. During the revision of studies on the antioxidative effects of Hiera-cium and Pilosella taxa it became apparent that in two cases the authors did not state what plant organs were extracted (Tepe et al., 2006; Bonomo et al., 2020) while two other studies lacked information on the extractants (Bakar et al., 2015; Borchardt et al., 2008). Both the plant organ as well as the solvents used for extraction can considerably in-fluence the composition of the extract and hence their biological effects (e.g. Bedoya et al., 2001). However, it should be mentioned that although only one study linked the bioactivity to a single compound (Gawron\u0301ska-Grzywacz et al., 2011), most of the other studies performed HPLC analyses and evaluated the composition of the tested extracts (Milutinovic\u0301 et al., 2018a, b; Bakar et al., 2015; Go\u0308kbulut et al., 2017; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2009) or provided information on total polyphenolic, total flavonoid, and/or tannin content (Woo et al., 2010; Bonomo et al., 2020; Go\u0308kbulut et al., 2017; Fraisse et al., 2011; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2009). Milutinovic\u0301 et al. (2018b) found that high total antioxidant activities, and DPPH and hydroxyl radicals scavenging abilities were generally linked to high total phenolic contents (TPC). Exceptions from that observation were linked to higher amounts of luteolin, while several other studies linked high contents of phenolics or chlorogenic acid to high antioxidative effects (Bakar et al., 2015; Go\u0308kbulut et al., 2017; Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2008, 2009; Bonomo et al., 2020). Fraisse et al. (2011) performed statistical experiments revealing a correlation between the total phenolics and the antioxidant activity (R2 = 0.8904) as well as the total dihydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (R2 =0.8529). They further calculated the contribution of cichoric acid, chlorogenic acid, 1,5-, 3,5-, and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids to the anti-oxidative effect, concluding that the dihydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are the main antioxidatives within P. officinarum. Bakar et al. (2015) linked the antioxidative effect to chlorogenic acid as well as flavonoids. It should be noted that in case of P. hoppeana subsp. testimonialis IC50 value of the root extract (IC50 = 0.231 mg/mL) was considerably lower than the corresponding value of the aerial parts (IC50 = 0.864 mg/mL) although the content of chlorogenic acid was higher in the aerial parts (1826.90 \u00b1 8.85 \u03bcg/g plant material; roots 954.03 \u00b1 3.52 \u03bcg/g plant material) and co-occurred with low amounts of flavonoids that were not detected in the roots. This trend was also observed in the MDA assay, in which the root extract displayed considerably lower MDA values than the aerial parts. However, this trend was not observed in case of second tested species, H. bornmuelleri. A similar finding was observed in case of H. pannosum, which root\u2019s extract had the highest content of chlorogenic acid of the tested extracts (1.25 g/100 g dry weight of plant material.) but displayed the lowest activity in the DPPH and ABTS assay. However, the root extract was most active in the ferric-reducing antioxidant power and the superoxide anion scavenging activity at the highest tested concentration (3 mg/mL). It cannot be ruled out that contents of other phenolics, i.e. caffeic acid, luteolin 7-glucoside, luteolin, and apigenin contribute to the observed effects. It should be mentioned that the contents of the phenolics were determined with a validated HPLC-DAD method that established the linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method. However, in several cases the stated values of the respective analytes were below the limit of detection (S/N 3/1) (root: caffeic acid, luteolin below LOD; leaves: caffeic acid, luteolin, apigenin beneath LOD, luteolin 7-glucoside beneath LOQ; flowering heads caffeic acid beneath LOD, apigenin beneath LOQ) (Go\u0308kbulut et al., 2017). As expected, the dichloromethane extract of the aerial flowering parts of H. gymnocephalum exhibited weak anti-DPPH activity (IC50 = 60 mg/mL), much lower than the polar extracts (Petrovic\u0301 et al., 2008). Stanojevic\u0301 et al. (2008) also tested a dichloromethane extract, specif-ically one of the aerial parts of P. officinarum in a DPPH assay, resulting in the finding that the IC50 value of the dichloromethane extract of P. officinarum was not within the tested concentration range (IC50 >0.18 mg/mL) and generally had the lowest radical scavenging activity out of the extracts. As outlined above in most cases polar compounds were responsible for the antioxidant effect that are not likely part of the apolar extract prepared in both studies. In addition, in some cases no standard deviation was provided in antioxidant assays (e.g. Koleckar et al., 2008). Investigations on the cytoxic activity of Hieracium and Pilosella remain scarce so far. Le Coguic and Seralini (2019) observed cytotoxic effect of a non-traditional nutraceutical mixture containing P. officinarum but they attributed those properties to the Taraxacum sp. and Fraxinus excelsior L. content. Nevertheless, additional tests verifying this assumption were not conducted. 6.5. - New pharmaceutical products development P. officinarum has been used in folk medicine for centuries, as evi-denced by the sources here reviewed. It is fairly distributed in the market of medicinal products, especially to treat urinary tract problems. In fact, The European Medicines Agency recommends the oral use of P. officinarum to increase the amount of urine in order to achieve flushing of the urinary tract as an adjuvant in minor urinary complaints (EMA/HMPC/680374/2013). This is very interesting in the treatment of chronic illnesses (e.g. urinary infections, prostate inflammation, etc.) where preparations made from these species might constitute a cheap alternative therapy to the conventional pharmaceutical products (Heinrich et al., 2018). In addition to the diuretic power, the proven antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities described could be very helpful to further develop improved phytoterapheutical products to treat or prevent these problems related to infections of the urinary tract or in conditions where the increase in diuresis could be adjuvant as well (e.g. sliming products). Taking into consideration the anti-inflammatory, vulnerary and gastroprotective properties proven for these species it could be also promising to design new products aimed to treat gastric problems. Finally, the combination of the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory power reported for these species makes them quite suitable for the development of new cosmetic products aimed to treat skin alterations. All these insights seem to be the most realistic scenario in the short term in order to introduce these plants extracts, or certain compounds derived from them, in the phytoterapheutical products market for me-dicinal or health-promoting purposes in humans. However, clinical research involving double blind studies with standardized herbal ex-tracts or metabolites (ideally optimized) in comparison to other phar-maceutical products would be desirable to perform. Like for many other medicinal plants, the idea that Hieracium\u2019s and Pilosella\u2019s specialised metabolites could constitute a new source of molecules for the treatment of priority healthcare diseases such as cancer, viral infections, diabetes or neurological illnesses is not realistic at all in a short term. However, a more-in-depth basic research on these bioactivities (based on the reported traditional uses), and natural com-pounds responsible for them would clarify whether these species may offer possibilities in the treatment of these conditions. In this regard, to broad the scope of the academic research in specialised metabolites beyond phenolic acids and flavonoids present in wild taxa will be essential to certify their suitability. Ideally, to direct the phytochemical research towards certain groups of metabolites such as sesquiterpenoids and coumarines would match these goals. The sesquiterpenoids exhibit a wide range of bioactivities including anti-inflammatory activity (Ly\u03b2 et al., 1998) and cytotoxicity (Jo\u0308hrer et al., 2012). Also, sesquiterpene lactones, which fulfil the known criteria for presence of the required functional groups to exert these potential bioactivites (Zidorn et al., 1999) constitute the most interesting ones with regards to these appli-cations (Zidorn, 2008). Given the large number of members and the few investigated taxa of Hieracium and Pilosella focusing on other compound classes than the well investigated phenolics and flavonoids, it is safe to J. Willer et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 281 (2021) 11446546speculate that a number of so far not described naturally occurring sesquiterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, coumarines and triterpenoid alcohols (among others) can be isolated in taxa from both genera. Some of these undescribed compounds might constitute a promising reservoir for the screening of bioactivites and subsequently the possibility of new lead structures with high value for the pharmaceutical industry. Finally considered, scientific information on target specialised metabolites production and elicitation using plant in vitro culture systems (e.g. micropropagation, cell suspension and hairy root cultures) are completely lacking in these genera, even for P. officinarum, which is the most studied species. These biotechnological platforms have been proven to act as effective biofactories for the production of high-added value specialised metabolites such as phenolic compounds (Alvar-ado-Orea et al., 2020; Demirci et al., 2020; Karalija et al., 2020) or sesquiterpene lactones (Pourianezhad et al., 2019) and coumarines (Yousefian et al., 2021). Therefore, further investigation on phyto-chemical elicitation under in vitro culture conditions will certainly provide new insights to the revalorisation of Hieracium and Pilosella species as medicinal plants and the development of new phytoter-apeutical products based on their specialised metabolites. 7. - Conclusions The review here presented analyses the current knowledge on the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and bioactivities of species belonging to Hieracium and Pilosella. Only 34 species are reported to have traditional uses. This is most probably due to the high number of range-restricted taxa, the loss of popular knowledge and the historical difficulties to distinguish the different taxa within this complex. Tradi-tional uses having the strongest experimental support are the anti- infammatory and antimicrobial as, in our criterion, all studied extracts showed pronounced bioactivities by means of in vitro and, in some cases, in vivo models. Although diuretic activity is also experimentally tested both in vitro and in vivo, it would be beneficial to perform additional studies to finally support this traditional use. In addition, it is quite clear which metabolites are responsible to exert anti-inflammatory, antimi-crobial and diuretic activities: phenolics and flavonoids. For the other bioactivities, there is no clear correlation between chemical composition and properties, or those properties are not outstanding when comparing to other plants\u2019 extracts. Therefore, the above-mentioned fields of application represent the most plausible scenario for the new market-able products development based on these species\u2019 specialised metab-olites. However, as it happens to other drugs originating from plants, it would be necessary to perform clinical research including double blind studies in humans as the ultimate proof of relevant bioactivity. Partly clear evidences were observed for the antioxidant, gastroprotective, cytotoxic, antiepileptic, and antidiabetic activities as these experiments were only performed by means of in vitro approaches, and in some cases lacking proper experimental design (e.g. lack of positive or negative controls). Therefore, further research is highly encouraged to clarify these gaps in our knowledge. Finally considered, we found several works dealing with bioactivities of species without references on their tradi-tional usage. On the other hand, species (e.g. H. umbellatum) having a quite well documented ethnopharmacological record are not tested for their bioactivities. Therefore, it would be interesting to focuss the effort of studying species with ethnopharmacological relevance in parallel to the intensification of the ethnopharmacological research efforts above mentioned. As demonstrated above, many studies investigating possible bioactivities of Hieracium and Pilosella species were restricted to the evaluation of crude extracts, thus not identifying active principles. Hence, future studies should include a bioactivity guided approach of isolation after the initial screening. Also, it would be desirable to focus on certain specialised metabolites and their bioactivities (e.g. sesqui-terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones) and the role of in vitro plant cell cultures in their biosynthesis and elicitation.
