DOI:10.24193/subbchem.2019.4.15 FROM PHYTOCHEMISTRY TO METABOLOMICS: EIGHT DECADES OF RESEARCH IN PLANT AND FOOD SCIENCE CARMEN SOCACIUa ABSTRACT. Phytochemistry represents a large interdisciplinary research area which apply the chemical knowledge in plant biology, biochemistry and physiology. Since centuries, the technology related to the isolation and characterization of phytochemicals (plant secondary metabolites) developed gradually towards a holistic approach of omics\u2019 technology, as part of the \u201csystems biology\u201d concept. This review underlines the scientific progress during the last eight decades, from \u201cclassical\u201d phytochemistry to metabolomics, applied on plants and food and reflects not only the role of phytochemicals as key-molecules with essential roles in plants and with great benefits on animal and human health, but also their involvement in plant chemotaxonomy, food technology and authenticity. First, a selection of the major groups of phytochemicals and their main bioresources. The metabolomic technology is presented, as a high-throughput analytical platform to identify, by untargeted or targeted techniques, the fingerprint or key metabolites of a specific pathway in plants or for authentication of a food matrix. Updated literature data are presented, including a summary of eight decades of achievements of the research group related to Chemistry and Biochemistry of Natural Products at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, celebrating now 150 years of existence. Keywords: Phytochemistry, Metabolomics, Analytical platform INTRODUCTION Phytochemicals Since centuries, plants were studied as huge reservoir of valuable, small molecules, named phytochemicals. Phytochemistry was defined as being the study of these chemicals in plants and includes their isolation, a University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, 3-5 Manastur Street, 400372 Cluj-Napoca, Romania, e-mail: carmen.socaciu@usamvcluj.ro CARMEN SOCACIU 206 structural analysis, biosynthesis and their functions in plants, animals and humans, as reported by Lind since 1757, Eijkman in 1929 or Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi in 1939, recently cited [1]. Nearly 400,000 flowering plants have been classified so far, only around 5% being used for medicinal purposes, and only a minority were studied in detail with regard to the chemical composition and biological effects. The Dictionary of Natural Products contains around 160,000 chemical entities isolated from plants and microorganisms [2]. Medicinal plants have always been used since ancient times to treat diseases, but the knowledge about active components of herbal preparations remained fragmentary since the biosynthetic pathways of many secondary metabolites of pharmacological importance have been elucidated only in a few species, while their chemodiversity remained largely unexplored [3, 4]. Phytochemistry adopts a phylogenetic approach and can be considered as an independent sub-field of botany or chemistry which analyses plants, identify and describe the structures of the large number of small molecules (secondary metabolites) produced by plants for their reproduction, insects\u2019 attraction and defense against pathogens. While primary metabolites (carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids, lipids) are related to the nutritional quality of plants and food, phytochemicals are \u201cnon-nutrients\u201d but highly bioactive compounds with positive or negative effects on human health. Such secondary metabolites display a large structural diversity, reflecting the higher plants phenotype and adaptations to the various ecological environments [5] their biosynthesis and functions in plants being complemented by their actions, which determined the development of phytopharmacy and phytomedicine, providing the evidence of their health benefits [6]. There are three major groups of phytochemicals: phenolics (representing aprox. 45%), terpenoids and steroids (27%), alkaloids (18%) and other organo-sulfur or organo-nitrogen derivatives. Phenolics are water soluble compounds found in different plant and food sources while terpenes and terpenoids are lipophilic groups of major phytochemicals, as presented in Table 1. Alkaloids and sulfur- or nitrogen-containing phytochemicals are also included. FROM PHYTOCHEMISTRY TO METABOLOMICS: EIGHT DECADES OF RESEARCH IN PLANT \u2026 207 Table 1.

The term \u201cmetabolomics\u201d FROM PHYTOCHEMISTRY TO METABOLOMICS: EIGHT DECADES OF RESEARCH IN PLANT \u2026 209 was mentioned for the first time in 1998 and developed tremendously as a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of primary and secondary metabolism in plants. It brings a holistic understanding of plant biology [9], as a complementary technology to functional genomics approaches such as transcriptomics and proteomics and contributes to a systems biology approach. Moreover, metabolomics as a post-genomics tool may offer distinct advantages when compared to other \u2018-omics\u2019 technologies. (e.g. changes in the transcriptome or proteome do not always correlate to biochemical phenotypes). Metabolomics technology involve advanced analytical tools that provide high degrees of sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility are required. State-of-the-art of metabolomics comprises emerging analytical platforms such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry-based techniques (GC\u2013MS and HPLC\u2013MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages [10-13]. A Web of Science recent search, using the terms \u201cmetabolomics\u201d or \u201cmetabonomics\u201d found around 8800 publications. Such data provides high level information regarding the key-biomarkers for a specific plant or food, novel chemotaxonomic markers of biodiversity, plant-based drug discovery, food authenticity and traceability, as well the impacts of environmental stress or processing technology. There are three different approaches to metabolomics that support the compound discovery efforts: targeted metabolomics, untargeted metabolomics and a hybrid technique of targeted-untargeted metabolomics. Targeted metabolomics is a term used for the identification and quantification of one or more targeted molecules in a biological sample. Targeted analysis uses standards and/or spectroscopic data libraries, often in conjunction with other \u201comics\u201d technologies in order to answer a specific research questions. It resembles to traditional phytochemical analysis which quantify specific molecules or classes of metabolites by optimizing their extraction, separation and detection methods. The untargeted metabolomics is an unsupervised, data-driven approach, a process generating data sets which represents the whole chemical spectrum of a biological sample without bias, with predictive power. The untargeted analysis have a great potential in chemometric fingerprinting, compound and pathway discovery and hypothesis generation, but standardization is difficult and the potential for false discovery is high. Targeted-untargeted metabolomics is a hybrid of analytical approach which combines technologies (chromatography, spectrometry) using available databases or other \u201comics\u201d to target specific metabolites. Untargeted data sets are mined for known compounds from different species or tissues or CARMEN SOCACIU 210 food matrices. The discovery of new metabolites and putative pathways is possible by these technologies, finding relationships between molecules in the data sets. Metabolomics uses, beside advanced analytical technologies, subsequent multivariate data analyses and updated biostatistics tools (e.g. Profile Analysis, Metaboanalyst) [14]. Recently, available databases of metabolome and metabolic biomarkers (Lipid Gateway, Phenol Explorer, KEGG) became also sine-qua-non tools for adequate interpretation of biological significance [15]. Also, the Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical database facilitates in-depth searches of plants, chemicals, bioactivity and ethnobotany [16]. PLANT AND FOOD METABOLOMICS Plant phenotyping and food authentication Plant metabolomics was defined as a \u201clarge scale phytochemistry\u201d [17], a \u201cnew frontier\u201d in phytochemical analysis [18], a \u201cmissing link\u201d in functional genomics [19, 20]. It provides an integrative view of endogenous metabolic patterns during plant growth, development and senescence but also responses to genetic events, environment and disease, gathering new information about the plant secondary metabolism. It covers new, interdisciplinary topics related to plant science, from chemotaxonomy, stress and biotic interactions, systemic pathogen resistance, induced resistance to diseases, plant and food authentication by specific biomarkers, biomarkers for biomedical applications (19, 21-23]. The metabolite profiling is also an aid to metabolic engineering in plants [24]. This technology differs from the classical phytochemical analysis in various fundamental aspects, being a holistic, data-driven approach with predictive power to assess all measurable metabolites without any pre-conception or pre-selection (as untargeted fingerprinting), possibly followed by targeted metabolite identification and quantitation. The phylogenetic approach of phytochemistry is completed by the performance of \u2018omics\u2019 tools based on advanced analysis, as reviewed recently [25, 26]. Plants have one of the largest metabolome (full set of metabolites), their leaves contain up to 30 000 phytochemicals, an arsenal prepared to survive and fight against abiotic and biotic environmental stressors. More than 200 000 different secondary metabolites have been isolated, purified, and identified from plants. In the past decade, around 1200 articles have been published describing plant metabolomes. The key factors in using efficiently the plant metabolomics data are the experimental design, authentic standard availability, extract standardization and statistical analysis. FROM PHYTOCHEMISTRY TO METABOLOMICS: EIGHT DECADES OF RESEARCH IN PLANT \u2026 211 Since abiotic and biotic stresses are the main reasons of substantial crop yield losses worldwide, recent researches were devoted to the mechanisms of plant interactions with the environment and the resistance to stress, especially using metabolomics technology based on mass spectrometry [27]. Among omics approaches, the metabolomics is the most complex and has received inadequate attention in crop science, particularly for trait mapping and plant selections [28]. An overview of the fundamental analytical technologies and subsequent multivariate data analyses involved in plant metabolomics was recently published [20]. The diverse omics platforms have great potential in improving the current understanding of important traits, enabling to develop new strategies for plant improvement. For the continued development of plant metabolomics, at least three objectives still need to be achieved: improvements in the elucidation of plant metabolome, comparisons of the results found in different laboratories and experiments, followed by the integration of plant metabolomics data with other functional genomics. The plant metabolomic analysis developed rapidly in line with the new analytical tools for chemical separations (gas and liquid chromatography, capllary electrophoresis) and detection for molecular identification (mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy) which emerged the last decades, generating valuable metabolite databases [29], as presented above. The general application of metabolomics in food science and nutrition has been also reviewed [30, 31] underlying the importance of improvements in food analytical chemistry, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry, NMR and advanced statistical techniques to process the large data sets [32, 33]. Plant and food metabolomics has improved our capacity to analyse the overall metabolome as well as helping to perform pathway analysis and metabolite identification [11,13]. Metabolomics tools are only now being used to identify different food components but also the food born derivatives, such as flavours during food processing. Recently, there were characterized the characteristics of the different groups of aroma-related metabolites and their relevant chemical and sensorial characteristics [33], including Maillard reaction pathways. Small phytochemical metabolites play a central role in food quality as they are coloured, fragrant or bioactive, contributing to nutritional value and to positive or negative sensory attributes (e.g. off-flavours). More than 20,000 compounds are identified in different foods (http://www.Foodb.ca). To understand the relationship between food quality and processing, a complete analysis of the metabolites present in a food sample is still needed [34]. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques are the most widely used in food science either for volatile or non volatile, polar or unipolar molecules [35]. CARMEN SOCACIU 212 Food adulteration, mislabeling and fraud, is a worldwide growing concern. Current challenges associated with food authentication are influenced by the geographic origin, breed/variety identification, plant/animal production technology, food processing, etc. Accurate and reliable analytical methods are applied nowadays to monitor and control food authenticity and to guarantee correct and accurate labeling of foodstuffs, assuring that the components included in a food product are of the nature and quality declared by the seller. Omics\u2019 based technologies circumvent the limitations of traditional methodologies, being developed for the authentication of a wide range of food commodities. Recently it was reviewed the updated literature, since 2015, which applied omics-based technologies and especially metabolomics, for food authentication [36]. TRADITION AND MODERNITY 80 Years of Research at USAMV in Cluj-Napoca, Romania The research group on \u201cChemistry and Biochemistry of Natural Compounds\u201d was created since 80 years, at the former Institute of Agronomy in Cluj, known today as University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, which celebrates this year 150 years of existence. The mentor of this group, professor Cornel Bodea (member of Romanian Academy and director of the Institute of Chemistry in Cluj) have had major contributions to the development of Phytochemistry in Romania, leading the most prominent group of Plant Science research in Romania, especially focused on secondary metabolites (carotenoid pigments), their biosynthesis, isolation and characterization from different bioresources, as well the beneficial effects on animals and humans. The scientific performance of this group, especially the last 5 decades is revealed by many international collaborations and publications in books, international journals. A prove of its international recognition was the organization, in 1972 of the 3rd International Carotenoid Symposium in Cluj. The scientific performance was continued by the followers Prof. G. Neam\u0163u, prof. V. T\u0103ma\u015f and their collaborators, some of the most relevant publications being mentioned in Table 2. The last 3 decades, another significant progress was noticed in this group, in-line to the diversification of phytochemistry areas and development of omics\u2019 technologies, as well due to the improvement of analytical facilities and formation of young scientists, approaching the plant and food metabolomics technology. Secondary metabolites, especially carotenoids, tocopherols, phytosterols, fatty acids, terpenoids, different polyphenols (from FROM PHYTOCHEMISTRY TO METABOLOMICS: EIGHT DECADES OF RESEARCH IN PLANT \u2026 213 phenolic acids to flavonoids, catechins and anthocyanins), but also terpenoids, glucosinolates from different plant sources enlarged the scientific areas of interest, being focused on the improvement of extraction procedures, separation by different chromatographic tools, isolation and characterization by different spectrometry tools, evaluation of their antioxidant/antitumor effects. Advanced biostatistics was developed for the proper classification (plant chemotaxonomy), confirmation of food authenticity or fraud identification. Table 2 reviews the most significant results, published in many international impact publications (more than 220, according to Web of Science) which prove the scientific performance reached nowadays. More than 40 PhD students were trained and involved in different projects and experiments related to Phytochemistry, Plant and Food metabolomics, including applications bio(nano)technology and in biomedical areas. The progress of this group\u2019 knowledge and expertise was significantly due to the performant metabolomic platform (HPLC-DAD-MS, GC-MS, Raman and FTIR Spectrometry) and advanced biostatistics/bioinformatics tools (multivariate combined with univariate data analyses) in the context of systems biology concept. The previous and present studies, as well the results on applying omics\u2019techniques are presented below, showing their impact on the new, emerging research areas such as bioeconomy, food industry, functional food and nutrition, phytomedicine [37].
