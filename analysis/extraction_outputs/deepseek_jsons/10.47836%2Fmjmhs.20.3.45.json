DOI: 10.47836/mjmhs.20.3.45a Centre for Medical Laboratory Technology Studies, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, SelangorBranch, Puncak Alam Campus, Selangor, Puncak Alam, 42300, Malaysiab Department of Biomedical Science, Kulliyyah of Allied Health Sciences, International Islamic University Malaysia, JalanSultan Ahmad Shah, Bandar Indera Mahkota, Pahang, Kuantan, 25200, MalaysiaAbstractMorinda citrifolia L., commonly known as mengkudu in Malaysia, is a medicinal plant utilized for thousands of years to treatvarious health problems. The plant has been widely used in traditional medicine, especially among the Malay community.However, there is little scientific proof of the medicinal properties of the plant. Thus, this review discussed and summarizedthe latest scientific findings on the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of M. citrifolia L. The research articles weregathered from various electronic databases and following the title, abstract and content screening, a total of 136 articleswere selected from SCOPUS (56), Web of Science (25), Science Direct (16), and Google Scholar (39) from 2016 to 2022.The duplicated articles from the databases were then eliminated. Information was gathered from the resulting 45 articlesand discussed in this review. The data suggested that phytochemical compounds, mainly from the phenolics and flavonoidsclasses, found within different parts of the M. citrifolia L. plant possessed biological activities, including antibacterial,antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anticancer, and antihypertensive properties. Factors such as the conditions andsolvents used during the extraction process played essential roles in investigating the therapeutic properties of differentparts of the plant. Although M. citrifolia L. could treat diseases, more clinical trials are needed to understand its therapeuticand preventive effects. \u00a9 2024 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.
