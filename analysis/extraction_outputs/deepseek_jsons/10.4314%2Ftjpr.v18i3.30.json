DC. is a shrub or a small evergreen tree species which belongs to the Celastraceae family. The species is commonly referred to as forest saffron, saffron or wood saffron. E. croceum has in the past classified under several scientific names such as Cassine crocea (Thunb.) Kuntze, C. papillosa (Hochst.) Kuntze, Crocoxylon croceum Thunb. N. Robson, C. excelsum Eckl. & Zeyh., E. capense Eckl. & Zeyh., Salacia zeyheri Planch. ex Harv., Ilex crocea Thunb., E. croceum Thunb. DC. and E. papillosum Hochst. [1,2]. E. croceum is among the top 15 medicinal plants that are becoming scarce in KwaZulu Natal province in South Africa based on the information provided by traditional healers [3-5]. The could be as a result of over-collection as the species is widely sold in informal herbal medicine markets in both rural and urban areas of Gauteng [6] and KwaZulu Natal provinces in South Africa [4]. Over-collection of wild populations of E. croceum as a source for medicinal plant trade and other anthropogenic activities such as habitat destruction and land clearing for agricultural purposes have caused a severe reduction in the population size of the species [7]. E. croceum is regarded as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [8] but due to local -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a9 2019 The author.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Botanical profile and medicinal uses of E. croceum E. croceum (Figure 1) grows up to a height of 15 metres with a trunk diameter of 250 mm [12]. The species has been recorded in montane forest margins and along the escarpment, mainly on seepage zones. The main stem is red-brown to grey in colour and may have some dark lenticels when young characterized by pale grey and thin bark, peeling off to reveal bright orange and yellow under-bark [13]. The leaves are opposite to sub-opposite in arrangement and oblong to elliptic in shape. The apex and base of the leaves is broadly tapering, leaf margins are strongly serrated and sometimes spined. The leaves are glossy green above and little paler below with prominent venation on both sides. The flowers are small, whitish or pale green in colour, occurring axillary clusters. The fruits are fleshy, ovoid in shape and creamy to yellowish in colour [14]. The species has been recorded in Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and naturalized in St Helena [1,14]. Figure 1: E. croceum branch showing a fruit and leaves (photo: D Becking) E. croceum bark is used as an emetic and purgative [15,16] as herbal medicine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) opportunistic infections [17]. The bark is also traditionally used to treat and manage tuberculosis [18] and other related diseases such as blood in sputum [18], chest congestion [12,16,19-21], cough [18] and sore throat [16]. The bark is used to manage and treat fever [18] and bark, roots and leaves of the species as herbal medicine to clean the digestive tract [12,16,19-21].

Drewes and Mashimbye [24] isolated flavonoids, sugar and triterpenoids and these compounds included (+)-6R,13R-11,11-dimethyl-1,3,8,10-tetrahydroxy-9-methoxy-peltogynan, (-)-4\u2019-0-methoxyepigallocatechin, ouratea proanthocyanidin A, galactitol, tingenone, tingenin B, canophyllol, 3-hydroxyIupeol and 30-hydroxylup 20(29)-en-3-one from the stem bark of E. croceum (Figure 2). Prinsloo et al [20] isolated a cardiac glucoside, digitoxigenin-glucoside from E. croceum bark extracts (Figure 2). Yelani et al [21] isolated triterpenoids such as 20-hydroxy-20-epitingenone, tingenone, tingenine B, 11\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amyrin and naringenin from the leaves of E. croceum (Figure 2). Prinsloo et al [20] evaluated anti-HIV activities of the compound digitoxigenin-glucoside isolated from E. croceum extracts by assessing the inhibition of recombinant HIV strain in an MT-2 VSV-pseudotyped recombinant virus assay. The compound showed significant inhibition of 90% at 0.2 \u00b5M [20]. Prinsloo et al [20,25] evaluated the cytotoxicity of the compound digitoxigenin-glucoside using the colourimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on Vero cells and scored as percentage reduction at 540 nm of treated culture versus untreated control culture. The isolated compound showed toxicity of only 20% at a concentration of 25 \u03bcg/ml on Vero cells with a therapeutic index of 250 [20,25]. Yelani et al [21] evaluated the cytotoxicity of hexane, dichloromethane, and acetone leaf extracts of E. croceum and compounds 20-hydroxy-20-epitingenone, tingenone, tingenine B, 11\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amyrin and naringenin isolated from the leaves of the species using the XTT (sodium 3\u2019-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitro] benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) colorimetric assay against four human cancer cell lines, Vero (monkey kidney), HeLa (human cervix cancer), SNO (human oesophagus cancer) and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) with doxorubicin and zearalenone as positive controls. All extracts showed activities, but significant activities were demonstrated by compounds 20-hydroxy-20-epitingenone and tingenone which showed activities against Vero cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 2.7 nM and 8.2 \u00b5M, respectively. The cytotoxicity of compounds 20-hydroxy-20-epitingenone and tingenone against three human cancer cell lines, HeLa, MCF-7, and SNO showed IC50 values ranging between 2.5 \u00b5M to 0.4 \u00b5M [21].

The extract had a dose dependent response in the in vitro anti-arthritic test, exhibited IC50 value of 80.0 \u03bcg/ml which was higher than the IC50 value of 32.4 \u03bcg/ml exhibited by the positive control diclofenac sodium [23]. The promising activities of the extracts support the traditional usage of the species for inflammatory conditions. Antibacterial activity Eloff et al [26] evaluated antibacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum bark using the agar diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The extract showed activities against the tested pathogens with total activity values ranging from 8.0 ml/g to >275.0 ml/g [26]. Kaikabo et al [27] evaluated antibacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum bark using a two-fold serial microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) screening was conducted at concentrations of 0.02 mg/ml to 2.5 mg/ml. The extracts had activity against at least one of the test organisms over a period of 1, 2 or 24 hours with average MIC values of the extracts against the tested pathogens ranging from 0.2 mg/ml to 1.8 mg/ml [27]. Elisha et al [28] evaluated antibacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves against Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain using the microplate serial dilution method with gentamicin as a positive control. The extract showed activities with MIC value of 0.3 mg/ml and total antibacterial activity of 290.0 ml/g [28]. Elisha et al [29] evaluated the antibacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli using a serial microdilution method with gentamicin as a positive control. The extract exhibited activities with MIC values ranging from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.31 mg/ml and total antibacterial activity values ranging from 290.2 ml/g to 1124.6 ml/g [29]. Elisha et al [30] evaluated antibacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using microplate serial dilution technique with gentamicin as a positive control. The extract showed activities with MIC values ranging from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.4 mg/ml and total antibacterial activity ranging from 214.2 ml/g to 1124.6 ml/g [30]. Mamba et al [17] evaluated antibacterial activities of ethanol extract of E. croceum bark against Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Oligella ureolytica using the broth microdilution method with ciprofloxacin as a positive control. The extract exhibited activities against tested pathogens with MIC values ranging from 1.6 mg/ml to 12.5 mg/ml while ciprofloxacin exhibited MIC value of <0.01 mg/ml [17]. Odeyemi and Afolayan [24] evaluated antibacterial activities of aqueous extract of E. croceum leaves and stem bark against Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus using the agar well diffusion and broth microdilution methods with amoxicillin (0.0125 mg/mL) as the positive control. The extracts exhibited activities against all the tested pathogens with zone on inhibition ranging from 13.0 mm to 15.7 mm. The control, amoxicillin was active against Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus with zone on inhibition ranging from 12.5 mm to 26.5 mm. The MIC values exhibited by the extracts and the control against all the pathogens ranged from 0.6 mg/ml to >5.0 mg/ml [24]. The documented antibacterial activities exhibited by E. croceum extracts show the potential of the species as herbal medicine against bacterial pathogens and also corroborate the traditional uses of the species as herbal medicine against sore throat in South Africa [16]. Antimycobacterial activity Lall and Meyer [18] evaluated antimycobacterial activities of aqueous and acetone extracts of E. croceium bark against drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the agar plate method. The acetone extract exhibited activities with MIC value of 1.0 mg/ml [18]. Elisha et al [31] evaluated the antimycobacterial activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves against Mycobacterium aurum, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium smegmatis using serial microdilution method with rifampicin and streptomycin as positive controls. The extracts showed activities against tested pathogens with MIC value of 1.3 mg/ml against Mycobacterium fortuitum and MIC value of 2.5 mg/ml against both Mycobacterium aurum and Mycobacterium smegmatis and total antimycobacterial activities ranged from 36.0 ml/g to 72.0 ml/g. The positive Maroyi Trop J Pharm Res, March 2019; 18(3):673 controls, rifampicin and streptomycin showed MIC values ranging from 0.01 mg/ml to 0.06 mg/ml [31]. These findings corroborate the traditional uses of the species as herbal medicine against tuberculosis [18] and related diseases such as blood in sputum [18], chest congestion [12,16,19-21], cough [18] and sore throat [16]. Antifungal activity Mamba et al [17] evaluated antifungal activities of ethanol extract of E. croceum bark against Candida albicans using the broth microdilution method with ciprofloxacin as a positive control. The extract exhibited activities with MIC value of 1.6 mg/ml while ciprofloxacin exhibited MIC value of <0.01 mg/ml [17]. The documented antifungal activities exhibited by E. croceum extracts show the potential of the species as herbal medicine against fungal and microbial pathogens. Anti-HIV activity Prinsloo et al [23] evaluated anti-HIV activities of E. croceum by assessing inhibition of transcription factors in the HeLa-TAT-Luc and MT-2 VSV-pseudotyped recombinant virus assays. T he extracts showed potent inhibition of transcription factors at 100 ng/mL [23]. Mamba et al [17] evaluated anti-HIV activities of ethanol extract of E. croceum bark against recombinant HIV-1 enzyme using non-radioactive HIV-reverse transcriptase (RT) colorimetric assay with doxorubicin as a positive control. The extract exhibited low inhibitory activity of 30.2% while the positive control doxorubicin showed 96.5% inhibitory activity [17]. The documented anti-HIV activities exhibited by E. croceum extracts and the compound digitoxigenin-glucoside isolated from the species corroborate the traditional usage of the species against HIV opportunistic infections in South Africa [17]. Anti-inflammatory activity Elisha et al [25] evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves by determining the inhibition of nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 macrophages as well as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition. The extracts inhibited nitric oxide production in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages with E. croceum inhibiting NO production by 71.1 % at a concentration of 30.0 \u03bcg/ml. The extract exhibited good activities against 15-lipoxygenase activity with IC50 value of 26.2 \u03bcg/ml which was better than IC50 value of 53.7 \u03bcg/ml exhibited by the positive control quercetin [25]. Mamba et al [17] evaluated anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol extract of E. croceum bark by assessing the inhibitory effects on the pro-inflammatory enzyme, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) with quercetin as a positive control. The extract exhibited activities with IC50 values of 80.2 \u00b5g/ml while quercetin, the positive control exhibited IC50 value of 48.9 \u00b5g/ml [17]. Odeyemi and Afolayan [24] evaluated anti-inflammatory activities of acetone extracts of E. croceum leaf and stem bark using the protein denaturation assay with diclofenac as a positive control. The extracts showed activities with leaf and stem bark extracts exhibiting IC50 values of 0.9 mg/ml and 1.9 mg/ml, respectively while diclofenac, the positive control exhibited IC50 value of 0.3 mg/ml [24]. Olaokun et al [32] evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of acetone extracts of E. croceum bark by assessing the inhibitory effects on the pro-inflammatory enzyme, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) with quercetin as a positive control. The extract inhibited the activity of 5-lipoxygenase with an IC50 value 75.5 \u03bcg/ml [32]. These finding show the potential of E. croceum as herbal medicine for inflammatory conditions, pain and wounds. Antioxidant activity Elisha et al [25] evaluated the antioxidant activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves using the 2,2-dipheny-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, 2,2\u2019-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays with ascorbic acid and trolox as reference drugs. The extracts showed good ABTS and DPPH activities with IC50 values of 3.1 \u03bcg/mL and 7.7 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, which were comparable to IC50 values ranging from 2.9 \u03bcg/mL to 5.6 \u03bcg/mL exhibited by ascorbic acid and trolox, the two positive controls. FRAP and TEAC values were 1.0 and 1.3, respectively while ascorbic acid and trolox showed values ranging from 1.0 to 3.7 [25]. Odeyemi and Afolayan [24] evaluated antioxidant activities of acetone extracts of E. croceum leaf and stem bark using the DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS and FRAP assays with ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and rutin as reference drugs. The leaf extract IC50 values for ABTS assay was 0.09 mg/ml, DPPH (0.1 mg/ml) and FRAP (2.5 mg/ml) while bark extract IC50 values for ABTS assay was 0.2 mg/ml, DPPH (0.07 mg/ml) and FRAP (9.2 mg/ml). The IC50 values exhibited by the reference drugs, ascorbic acid, BHT and rutin ranged from 0.02 mg/ml to 3.5 mg/ml [24]. The Maroyi Trop J Pharm Res, March 2019; 18(3):674 documented antioxidant activities of the extracts of E. croceum are probably a result of flavonoids and phenolics which have been isolated from the species [24,25]. Cytotoxic activity Prinsloo et al [20,23] evaluated the cytotoxicity of semi-purified stem bark extracts of E. croceum using the colorimetric MTT assay on Vero cells and scored as percentage reduction at 540nm of treated culture versus untreated control culture. The ex t r ac t showed toxicity of only 20% at a concentration of 25 \u03bcg/ml on Vero cells with a therapeutic index of 250 [20,23]. Elisha et al [28] evaluated cytotoxicity activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves on Vero monkey kidney cells using the MTT reduction assay with doxorubicin as a positive control. The extract showed activities with median lethal concentration (LC50) value of 5.2 \u00b5g/ml and selectivity index (SI) value of 0.02 while doxorubicin, the positive control showed LC50 value of 8.3 \u00b5g/ml [28]. Elisha et al [30] evaluated cytotoxic activities of acetone extract of E. croceum leaves using MTT reduction assay on Vero cells. The extract showed activities with LC50 value of 5.2 \u00b5g/ml and selectivity index (SI) value ranging from 0.01 to 0.07 while doxorubicin, the positive control showed LC50 value of 8.3 \u00b5g/ml [30]. The extract exhibited high cytotoxicity, supporting findings by Yelani et al [21] who argued that cytotoxicity of E. croceum on Vero cells is due to toxic triterpenoids 20-hydroxy-20-epi-tingenone, tingenone, tingenine B, 11-hydroxy-amyrin and naringenin isolated from the leaves of the species. Despite the long use of E. croceum as herbal medicine in South Africa and Swaziland to treat numerous human diseases, the roots of the species are reported to have been used to cause death by traditional healers [33,34]. Research by Kunene et al [35] showed that E. croceum is categorized as detrimental and causing death of cattle in KwaZulu Natal province, South Africa. Experiments upon rabbits found that 2.5 g per kg body weight, and 10 g of fresh leaves per kg body weight caused death fifteen minutes after administration [36]. Based on these toxicological reports, it can be inferred that E. croceum should be taken with caution when used as herbal medicine. FINAL REMARKS Pharmacological studies carried out so far showed that the different extracts and constituents of the species to be promising, which calls for detailed phytochemical, pharmacological and clinical studies of different extracts and chemical constituents of the species. Determination of the active principles is very important in the extracts and compounds of the species in order to avoid life-threatening complications as the species is widely used as herbal medicine. There is lack of information about the effect of prolonged consumption of E. croceum extracts. Therefore, future studies should include the identification of toxic compounds, possible side effects caused by taking E. croceum as herbal medicine, and mechanisms of how potential toxic components of the species can be managed.
