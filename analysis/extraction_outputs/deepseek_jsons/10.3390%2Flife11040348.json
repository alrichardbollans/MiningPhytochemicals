Andrographispaniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees and its metabolites have been long used to treat IDs. Andro-grapholide, derived from A. paniculata, can inhibit invasive microbes virulence factors and regulatethe host immunity. Controlled clinical trials revealed that A. paniculata treatment is safe and effi-cacious for acute respiratory tract infections like common cold and sinusitis. Hence, A. paniculata,mainly andrographolide, could be considered as an excellent candidate for antimicrobial drug devel-opment. Considering the importance, medicinal values, and significant role as antimicrobial agents,this study critically evaluated the antimicrobial therapeutic potency of A. paniculata and its metabo-lites, focusing on the mechanism of action in inhibiting invasive microbes and biofilm formation. Acritical evaluation of the secondary metabolites with the aim of identifying pure compounds thatpossess antimicrobial functions has further added significant values to this study. Notwithstandingthat A. paniculata is a promising source of antimicrobial agents and safe treatment for IDs, furtherempirical research is warranted.Keywords: antimicrobial agent; clinical trial; ethnopharmacology; infectious disease; medicinal plant;metabolites; natural products1. IntroductionInfectious disease (ID) is a serious global health problem that leads to a high mortalityrate worldwide every year [1]. The world has recently witnessed a most formidablethreat in recent human history, COVID-19, in the modern era of highest advancementof medical sciences. Infectious agents (i.e., invading microbes or pathogens) evolved avariety of strategies, such as modulating their cell surfaces, releasing proteins to inhibitor degrade host immune factors, or even mimicking host molecules to evade the hostLife 2021, 11, 348. https://doi.org/10.3390/life11040348 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/lifeLife 2021, 11, 348 2 of 39immunity and ensuring their own survival within a host [2\u20134]. Pathogens, particularlybacteria, are multifaceted in their methods used to escape host immune detection. Due tohaving the mastery of these camouflaging and precise weaponry techniques by pathogens,developing new vaccines and innovative treatments become challenging, even in somecases almost impossible, for example, treating antibiotic-resistant strains. As a result, thedeath toll is increasing rapidly. For example, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)has recorded around 206,000 new cases in 2019, a 10% increase from 187,000 in 2018, and atotal of 1.4 million people died from tuberculosis in 2019 [5]. Furthermore, antibiotics usagecauses some common side effects, including hypersensitivity and depletion of beneficialgut microorganism [6,7].Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is another significant cause of an-tibiotic resistance since physicians needlessly write antibiotic prescriptions [8\u201312]. Eventhough the vast majority of URTIs are mild, self-diagnosed and self-treated, they are themost common reason for absenteeism from school or work [13]. URTIs can be mainlycaused by viruses, such as a rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, andrespiratory syncytial virus. Bacteria like S. pyogenes, a Group A Streptococcus, may causeroughly 15% of sudden onset pharyngitis presentations [8]. Viral pharyngitis is mainlytreated based on the symptoms that appeared, whereas bacterial pharyngitis can be treatedwith antibiotics. However, current evidence does not support the usefulness of antibi-otics treatment in non-specific URTIs [13,14]. Therefore, research is urgently requiredto find alternatives to conventional medications for eradicating IDs. Natural productsbased therapy could be an excellent source of antimicrobial agents that would offer symp-tomatic relief since they have the high potentiality to inhibit the growth of microbes inthe host-defence mechanism [4], as well as they offer promising outcomes in the scientificinvestigations [15\u201320]. Additionally, it would reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription;therefore, the chances of antibiotic-resistance would be reduced.Nowadays, the philosophy of drug discovery has transformed into \u201cone drug, multi-target\u201d from \u201cone drug, one target\u201d [16,21\u201328]. Plant-derived secondary metabolites holdthe potential of multi-targeting properties as they need to undergo evolving defencemechanisms of the plant against predators like bacteria, fungi, virus, even insects and her-bivores [15,16,21,22,29,30]. A majority of the world population relies on medicinal plantsfor first-line treatment due to the severe side effects of synthetic drugs [31]. Moreover,plants\u2019 ability to cure diseases and the necessity of their study in sacred texts motivatedpeople to use natural remedies and researchers to study their pharmacology [32,33].Plant-based secondary metabolites commonly isolated are phenols, tannins, flavonoids,lignans, terpenes, and a wide range of alkaloids [21]. Since natural products are bettermodels with ideal pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics properties [16], often featurebiologically relevant molecular scaffolds and pharmacophore patterns that have evolvedas preferred ligand-protein binding motif [22], they gained tremendous importance forthe development of polypharmacological drugs for IDs, cancers, and neurological disor-ders [22,34]. Furthermore, about 80% of drugs are either natural products or analoguesmimicking them, and steadily increasing approval rate (after the 1990s, the average annualapproval rate is 10.3) of natural product-derived drugs from the US Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) have encouraged researchers and pharmaceutical industries to searchthe effective multitarget drugs for various ailments [30,34]. Currently, a number of naturalproducts, including morphine, quinine, reserpine, cocaine, and ephedrine, are now avail-able in pure form as drug substances [15]. Besides, many pure compounds are identifiedby pharmaceutical scientists worldwide because of having advanced technology that easesand fasten the characterization and structural elucidation of isolated metabolites. Capi-talizing on these findings are crucial for medical advancement to overcome unavoidablecircumstances happed by synthetic drugs.One attractive medicinal plant and its metabolites that have gained considerable andprogressive interest for decades are Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees. Thisannual plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is commonly known as \u201dKing of theLife 2021, 11, 348 3 of 39bitters\u201d or \u201dKalmegh\u201d. It is native to India and Sri Lanka and widely found in Southernand Southeastern Asia, including Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia,Myanmar, Philippines, and Thailand [35\u201339]. Usually, the aerial parts, roots or leavesof A. paniculata are used separately. These plant parts are used traditionally as powder,infusion, or decoction form either alone or in combination with other medicinal plantsfor the treatment of leprosy, gonorrhoea, respiratory tract infections, scabies, boils, skineruptions, chronic and seasonal fevers, griping, irregular bowel habits, loss of appetite,alopecia, general debility, diabetes, jaundice, dyspepsia, hemopathy, cough, oedema, livercomplaints, dysentery, malaria, enteritis, helminthiasis, herpes, peptic ulcer, skin infections(topical use), and snake-bites (topical use) [35,36,39,40].Modern science is focusing on validating the traditional claims of this plant throughsystemic investigations. Different extracts (i.e., acetone, chloroform, ethanol, hexane,methanolic or aqueous extract) and isolated pure metabolites from A. paniculata have beeninvestigated for pharmacological properties, for example, antibacterial, antiviral, antifun-gal, antiparasitic, choleretic, hypocholesterolemia, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic,hepatoprotective, anticancer, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular, antihyperlipidemic,emollient, anti-snake venom, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-fertility, carminative, andantipyretic properties at in vitro and in vivo conditions [41\u201353].Clinical trials were conducted to validate the in vitro and preclinical antimicrobialpharmacology of A. paniculata. Several clinical trials have justified the anti-infectiousactivity of A. paniculata against URTIs, influenza, and HIV as well as its effectivenessin treating osteoarthritis and multiple sclerosis [54\u201359]. The clinical studies conductedusing the standardized A. paniculata extracts alone or in combination with other medicinalplants (i.e., Kan Jang, KalmCold\u2122). The extracts reported having approximately 4\u20136%of andrographolide [56,60], responsible for the beneficial effects of the plant extracts.In recent years, there are few more clinical studies conducted [12,61\u201373]. However, todate, Andrographolide or A. paniculata extracts have not achieved the human clinicaltrial stage. This might be because of low bioavailability that is attributed to the fastbiotransformation and removal from the body [74] or due to a lack of a well-definedmechanism of action because it is considered as a highly promiscuous compound andengaged in covalent interactions with numerous previously unknown cellular targets incell type-specific manner [75]. There are two important and typical challenges: (i) poorpharmacokinetics and (ii) limited bioavailability are involved with many natural products,for example, \u03b2-sitosterol, quercetin, genistein, rutin etc., prevent their in vitro to preclinicalor clinical translation [76]. Nevertheless, there is a numerous investigation reportedto have potential efficacy of A. paniculata for IDs as well as other ailments, includingclinical efficacy. So, would A. paniculata extracts and their metabolites be a choice of bettertherapeutics? Would it be undergone for clinical development? Hence, there is a need toexplore further the feasibility of A. paniculata with potential use as anti-infective agents fora wide range of invasive microbes. A better understanding of the mode of actions of theactive ingredients of A. paniculata would enhance the clinical development of this drug.Additionally, there were several recent in vitro, in vivo, and a few clinical trials reportedits potential therapeutic efficacy for antimicrobial pharmacology. To our best knowledge,critical evaluation of A. paniculata\u2019s purported benefits is not substantial yet; hence, itwould be important to review them before conducting further research in this area.Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (i) to establish a comprehensive list ofantimicrobial metabolites of A. paniculata, (ii) to discuss the antimicrobial therapeuticpotency of A. paniculata and its metabolites, focusing on the mechanisms of actions, (iii) toevaluate the salient achievements of controlled clinical trials systematically to determineits efficacy and safety for the treatment of infections or infection causing agent.Life 2021, 11, 348 4 of 392. Andrographis paniculata\u2014\u201cThe King of Bitter\u201d2.1. Botanical Data of A. paniculataA. paniculata is an economically important herb of the Andrographis genus. It is anerect and branched and annual flowering herb. This herb grows well in hedgerowsthroughout the plane lands, hill slopes, waste ground, farms, moist habitat, seashores,and roadsides [38,39]. It can also be grown in the garden as well. For their excellentdevelopment, moist and shady places, forests, and wastelands are preferable. It is a salt-sensitive plant [77]; therefore, its growth is limited under stress conditions, particularlysalinity stress that drastically affects plant growth and crop productivity [78,79].This plant, under cultivation, can reach up to a height of 30 to 110 cm. Its stem is darkgreen, 30\u2013110 cm in length, 2 to 6 mm in diameter, quadrangular with longitudinal furrowsand wings at angles of the young parts, slightly enlarged at the nodes. The leaves are darkgreen, glabrous, 2\u201312 cm long and 1\u20133 cm broad, opposite, decussate, lanceolate, entiremargin, and venation pinnate; the petiole is very short. The flowers are small, consist offive linear particle calyx, narrow tube, and about 6 mm long white corolla with rose-purplespots on the petals. December to April is the flowering and fruiting period. The fruits aresmall 2-celled odourless erected capsules, 1\u20132 cm long, 2\u20135 mm wide, linear-oblong, acuteat both ends and compressed. The leaf taste is intensely bitter, and seeds are numerous,sub-quadrate and yellowish-brown (Figure 1) [77]. The detailed botanical description hasbeen reviewed somewhere else [39]. Different extracts and their secondary metabolites,particularly andrographolide, are one of the extensively studied natural products. Thetherapeutically active extracts are prepared, or metabolites isolated from aerial parts, leaves,roots, whole plants (Figure 1) or callus [36,37,80].Figure 1.

Recent Progress in Publication of A. paniculataThe measurement of scientific interest in a particular topic can be revealed from itstrend of publications. Due to having tremendous medicinal importance, the relentlessinterest in this plant and its versatile molecules have resulted in overwhelming publicationsover the past ten years. The publication numbers amounted to 3279 (as of 15 February2021). In other words, we can say, daily, almost one publication (Figure 2), of which about14% publications were about the antimicrobial study of either A. paniculata extracts or itsmetabolites, especially andrographolide. This bibliometric data was extracted from the Sco-pus database using the query of the term \u201cAndrographis paniculata\u201d OR \u201candrographolide\u201din titles, abstracts, and keywords. This number might be increased if data can be combinedfrom different databases like PubMed, Web of Science and so on.Figure 2. Annual publication statistics on topics covering the A. paniculata and andrographolide from2011 to 2020 (Scopus).3. Invasive Microbes Used in the Antimicrobial Study of A. paniculataThere are about 1400 known species of human pathogens. Although this seems likea large number, they are less than 1% of the total number of microbial species on theplanet earth [81]. Even though this is less than 1% of total microorganisms, a harmlessmicrobe can sometimes be harmful under a specific condition like an immunocompro-mised patient. Exploring proper medications for these spontaneous behavioural changingmicrobes is a continuous effort of the scientific community. A. paniculata extracts and theirbioactive molecules were investigated against a wide variety of pathogens, including sev-eral antibiotic-resistant species, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Candida spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae. We have identified atotal of 59 invasive microbes that have been used to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy ofA. paniculata extracts and/or their isolated pure compounds. The categorized microbes in-cluded 33 bacterial, four viral, 12 fungal and ten parasite species. The details antimicrobialeffectiveness of different extracts has been discussed in the later section. The list of testedmicrobes, their types, mode of transmission, a disease caused, and infecting organisms arepresented in the Supplementary Table S1.4. Antimicrobial Secondary Metabolites of A. paniculataA. Paniculata contains therapeutically active secondary metabolites that include lac-tones, diterpenes, flavonoids, quinic acid, xanthones, noriridoids, and other compounds. InLife 2021, 11, 348 6 of 39our previous study [39], we reported more than 55 ent-labdane diterpenoids, 30 flavonoids,eight quinic acid derivatives, four xanthones, and five rare noriridoids in A. paniculata;however, in this study, our extensive review revealed at least 142 secondary metabolitesthat already isolated from A. paniculata using different plant parts and fractionations of or-ganic solvents (i.e., acetone, butanol, chloroform, ethanol, methanol, and hexane) or waterand chromatographic analysis like thin layer chromatography (TLC), high-performancethin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), liquid chromatography, micellar electrokinetic cap-illary chromatography (MECC), high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC),high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra-performance liquid chromatog-raphy (UPLC), Silica Gel Chromatography (SGC), and flow injection spectrophotometry(FIS) [65,80,82\u2013168]. Among the chromatographic methods, HPLC and TLC are morecommonly used. This might be due to easy accessibility and accuracy. The UPLC is goodfor its selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, robustness, the limit of detectionand quantification. This method showed good linearity, accuracy and satisfactory precisionwith a run time of less than 3 min [165].The identified secondary metabolites included 78 ent-labdane diterpenoids, 41 flavono-ids, eight quinic acid derivatives, four xanthones, five rare noriridoids, three steroids andthree other compounds (Supplementary Table S2). A recent study also reported a sim-ilar number of unique secondary metabolites [169]. Among these compounds, about80 compounds showed different types of pharmacological activities, including antibac-terial [109,139,170\u2013175], anti-biofilm [88,176], antiviral (i.e., chikungunya virus [91], Anti-HIV [177\u2013179], anti-influenza [99,180], Herpes simplex virus 1 [83,99,181], dengue virusserotype 1 [92\u201394,182], anti-Epstein Barr virus [97], pestivirus and flavivirus [90], human pa-pillomavirus type 16 [96]), anti-fungal [109,183], antiparasitic (i.e., antimalarial [95,184,185],anti-Leishmaniasis [98]), antiproliferative [85\u201387,120,122,124,127,128,177,186], cytotoxic-ity [84\u201386,101,102,127,186], anti-inflammatory [84,86,136,187], antiplatelet aggregation [102],phagocytosis and anti-complement [84,86,102,104,109,113,114,117,128,133,135,138,142,177].Some of these metabolites did not exhibit pharmacological properties or showed very weekeffectiveness. The leads secondary metabolites isolated mainly from aerial parts (majoritycases), leaves, whole plant, and some from roots (Supplementary Table S2). The part used,geography, season, and time of harvesting of plant materials significantly influences thequantity and quality of phytoconstituents [39,188].To our best knowledge, a total of 35 isolated compounds have tested for antimicro-bial activities, of which 20 secondary metabolites (Figure 3) showed antimicrobial effects(Table 1). Antimicrobial metabolites were extracted from the whole plant, aerial part,leaves and roots (Figure 4). Most of the lead compounds have high potential, particularlycompounds (1\u20137, 14\u201320) against microbes. However, few compounds (8\u201313) showed veryweak potentiality or were inactive against different strains of bacteria, for example, Bacillussubtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea and fungi,such as Candida albicans, Candida sake, and Aspergillus niger [109].Andrographolide (1), neoandrographolide (2) and isoandrographolide (3) are the mostabundant lead bioactive compounds that can be isolated from any part of A. paniculata forexample, aerial apart, leaves, whole plant, and even roots. However, these present in highamounts in leaves [82]. The yield reached the maximum level while the plant materialscollected between 110\u2013130 days of cultivation [189]. Compounds 4 and 5 are the next mostabundant, followed by 6, 7, 14, 15. The least abundant are compounds 17\u201320, which areonly available in roots [190,191].Life 2021, 11, 348 7 of 39Figure 3.

Antibacterial EffectsFor centuries, the traditional use of A. paniculata in treating several IDs caused bybacteria encouraged researchers to study its anti-bacterial properties and how it fightsLife 2021, 11, 348 12 of 39against invasive microbes. Our review found about 33 different types of bacteria that wereinhibited by different types of extracts (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1).5.1.1. A. paniculata Extracts as Antibacterial AgentsResearchers used different types of extracts of A. paniculata to explore their poten-tiality against numerous invasive microbes, including antibiotic-resistant strains, such asmethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE), carbapenem-resistant Actinobacillus baumannii, \u03b2-Lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR)Haemophilus influenzae, P. aeruginosa. A summary of the antibacterial activity of the differenttypes of A. paniculata extracts is shown in Table 2.The aqueous extract of A. paniculata showed significant antibacterial activity, whichwas further linked to the presence of andrographolides and arabinogalactan proteins [195].The role of andrographolide and neoandrographolide in treating bacillary dysentery causedby Shigella sp. was reported in several studies as well [196,197]. In an experiment, A. panic-ulata was used to treat 1,611 cases of bacterial dysentery and 955 cases of diarrhoea [198].The efficacy of A. paniculata extracts for dysentery was proved from laboratory stool testwith 82.5% and 91.3% [198,199]. However, the crude water extract of A. paniculata leavesexhibited no effect on E. coli and K. pneumoniae. A significant activity against the Gram-positive S. aureus, MRSA, and Gram-negative P. aeruginosa was reported by crude waterextracts of leaves sample [200].In contrast, methanol extract of leaves showed significant activity against E. coli alongwith P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, B. subtilis and Streptococcus epidemidis [201].Furthermore, no antimicrobial effect of the aqueous extracts of the whole plant and isolatedandrographolide on tested common pathogenic bacteria [170]. However, ethanol extractswere found effective against Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis only [170]. Thesefindings indicated that the extraction process and solvent have a significant role in the effi-cacy of A. paniculata as the number and yield of pure metabolites greatly differ dependingon the types of fractions.Significant antibacterial activity of subsequent hexane, chloroform, n-butanol, andaqueous fractions of 50% ethyl alcohol-treated extracts of A. paniculata exhibited againstE. coli [202]. Similarly, the potent inhibitory effect of ethanol extract of aerial parts onthe growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, namely, Salmonella typhi,V. cholera, V. alginolyteus, S. aureus, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, E. coli, B. licheniformis,and Salmonella typhimurium. Another study [173] reported that the co-presence of andro-grapholide and arabinogalactan proteins in the ethanol extract was further acknowledgedfor its enhanced antibacterial activity compared to andrographolide and arabinogalactanproteins alone. This outcome has been derived maybe because of their synergistic effect.Life 2021, 11, 348 13 of 39Table 2.

Isolated Compound as Antibacterial Agent: Mechanisms of ActionA substantial number of evaluations proved the efficacy of different extracts of A. panic-ulata against many severe pathogenic microbes. Besides this, 13 pure secondary metabolitesof A. paniculata were also reported to have significant antibacterial effects (Table 1). Theseare compounds 1, 3\u20135, and 7\u201316. These compounds have been used to evaluate antibac-terial potency against a wide range of bacteria. Overall, Gram-positive bacteria weremore susceptible to compound 1 than Gram-negative bacteria due to the presence of theouter membrane and the polarity nature of the compound [119,139]. Depending on thebacterial species, the mode of actions of compound 1 differs by a large extent. S. aureus waslargely susceptible (MIC is 0.1 mg/mL) to compound 1 among the tested microbes [139].Healthcare-associated infections are prevalently (10.7%) caused by S. aureus, a major bac-terial human pathogen that can form biofilm [209]. It causes a wide variety of clinicalmanifestations, including pneumonia, mastitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, skin infec-tions, abscesses, food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and sepsis, and treatment remainschallenging due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains such as MRSA [210].Compound 1 acts on bacteria themselves as well as plays an important role in the regu-lation of host immunity by regulating macrophage phenotypic polarization and Ag-specificantibody production [211]. When S. aureus infected the lungs, it significantly promotesNF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation and increases TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production (Figure 5). Com-pound 1 can downregulate them sufficiently but retain the immune cells at the level thatcan kill bacteria without serious immune damage. In comparison to penicillin, compound1 showed better management of bacterial infection and persistent host immunity [212].Since compound 1 works on immune regulation, there are fewer chances of drug resistance.Therefore, compound 1 would further reduce the problems associated with antibioticresistance, one of the current severe health crises.In another study, Banerjee et al. [139] reported that compound 1 could strongly inhibitDNA synthesis (approximately 31%) and consequently RNA (about 26% inhibition) andprotein (around 36% inhibition) synthesis in S. aureus. This result was similar to thatof antibiotic ciprofloxacin (25% incorporation). However, cell wall biosynthesis was nothampered [212]. Secondary metabolites showing antimicrobial can work on a specifictarget site. Compound 1 can affect the quorum sensing system (QSS), a communicationsystem between bacteria; thereby, it is an effective antibacterial target. This system en-hances the production of biofilm by bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa. The antibacterial drugeffects in this system resulting in regulates the production of bacterial efflux pumps andvirulence factors [213]. Compound 1 effects on the QSS, especially Las and Rhl systems,resulting in reduced production of compositions of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS),such as carbohydrate, nucleotide, and amino acid polymers, as well as inhibiting viru-lence factors (Figure 5) [214,215]. In addition, compound 1 could restore the antibioticsensitivity in P. aeruginosa by reducing expression of mexAB-oprM efflux pump [216] andinhibit bacterial adhesion, such as E. coli and S. epidermidis, to the epithelial cells of lungs;therefore, significantly reduced respiratory colonization and level of fimA, papC, and tsh(Figure 5) [217].Life 2021, 11, 348 16 of 39Figure 5.

Mechanisms of Action Influence on Biofilm Production by Pure CompoundsAmong the selected metabolites, compound 1, 5 and 15 exhibited significant anti-biofilm effects against P. aeruginosa [88,176] and S. aureus [139]. Biofilm is a critical part ofbacterial pathogenesis in the host. The multilayer structure of biofilm acts as a potentialbarrier against the host defense and antibiotics action and serves as a sign of antibioticresistance as well. Biofilm-embedded bacteria are helped to break free from the drugs andweaken as a result [218]. Biofilm forming infections are getting severe health issues dailyand significantly enhancing antibiotic resistance; some are relevant to implant-associatedinfections [219,220]. Exploring efficient drugs are crucial as conventional antibiotics are notsufficient to inhibit the production of biofilm. A. paniculata brought an excellent opportunityLife 2021, 11, 348 17 of 39to treat biofilm infections as some of its metabolites, for example, compound 5 and 15,possess significant potentiality in inhibiting biofilm formation. Interestingly, A. paniculatametabolites showed synergistic effects with standard antibiotics (i.e., gentamicin andazithromycin), which were unable to reduce biofilm growth alone [88,176]. Compound5 and 15 showed efficacies in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 15 at 0.125 mMconcentration prevented about 54% biofilm formation. Inhibition of biofilm production wasfurther augmented up to 60% while the concentration was used at 0.15 mM [176]. Similarly,compound 5 showed a significant reduction of biofilm growth (about 56%) by P. aeruginosa,whereas compound 1 exhibited only 40% inhibition of biofilm production [88]. Neithergentamicin nor azithromycin was incapable of inhibiting biofilm production of P. aeruginosa.However, the outcome was dramatically changed to about 90% inhibition (p < 0.0001) whenthe bacteria were treated in a combination of compound 15 and gentamicin [119]. Incompound 5, this inhibition becomes about 92% while combined with gentamicin orazithromycin. However, compound 1 showed the least efficacy in inhibiting bacterialbiofilm production (about 60% in combination) than the other two compounds [88].EPS consists of carbohydrate, nucleotide, and amino acid polymers are considered asmajor components of the biofilm matrix produced by P. aeruginosa [221]. Both compound5 and 15 significantly reduced the level of biofilm carbohydrate, extracellular DNA, andproteins up to 90% while combined with gentamicin or azithromycin. Unfortunately,compound 1 was not adequate to reduce EPS compositions. They were also efficient toreduce essential virulence factors, the exoprotease activity (up to 93% inhibition), includingLasB, rhamnolipid, and pyocyanin in combined treatment as well as inhibit motilitymovement compared to the antibiotic gentamicin or azithromycin alone [88,176]. Thissynergism was achieved by inhibiting the process of biofilm development, not by killingmicrobes. For S. aureus biofilm formation, compound 1 at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mLdiminished biofilm thickness by about 45% on the polystyrene surface compared to thecontrol set after 24 h exposure [139]. Reduction of biofilm thickness was dose-dependentmanner, and the outcomes demonstrated that compound 1 has an important role in theinhibition of biofilm production in S. aureus.5.2. Antiviral EffectsSince the last three decades, researchers have extensively studied the antiviral prop-erties of A. paniculata. Although antiviral activity against a limited number of virusesviz. dengue virus serotype 1 [DENV-1] [182], herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1] [181],influenza A virus [180], HIV [54,177\u2013179], hepatitis B [186] and Hepatitis C [194] has beenreported, their findings are very encouraging and significant considering the role of theseviruses on human morbidity and mortality worldwide.It is noteworthy that the formation of syncytia in co-culture of HIV-1 infected MOLTcell lines was significantly inhibited by the methanol extracts of A. paniculata [222]. Theaqueous bark extracts of A. paniculata was investigated for HIV-1 protease inhibition activity,and this result supports an earlier report by Yao, et al. [223]. They reported positive results,but the extracts were less effective (29.6% and 26.3% inhibition at 250 \u00b5g/mL and 25 \u00b5g/mL,respectively) against HIV-1 protease [179]. Methanol extracts of A. paniculata showedantiviral effects against dengue virus (DENV) serotype-1 in vitro assay. After treating withthe extracts, the viability of DENV-1 infected Vero E6 cells was 113 \u00b1 4.65% with maximumnon-toxic dose (0.050 mg/mL), and the percentage of inhibition was 75% [182]. Panraksa,et al. [93] evaluated andrographolide\u2019s anti-viral activity against DENV serotype-2 inHepG2 and HeLa cell lines and DENV serotype-4 in one HepG2 cell line. They found asignificant reduction of cellular infection and virus output levels in both cell lines, HepG2(EC50 = 21.304 \u00b5M) and HeLa (EC50 = 22.739 \u00b5M) for DENV 2. The anti-viral activityof andrographolide was confined to a post-infection stage [93]. Andrographolide wasmore potent to inhibit DENV compared to the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The CHICKVEC50 (77 \u00b5M) was about 3.5 fold higher than the DENV, comparable to two differentDENV serotypes. In addition, andrographolide affected CHIKV replication [91]. BothLife 2021, 11, 348 18 of 39cases in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines did not show any toxicity sign after treating withandrographolide at a maximum concentration of 100 \u00b5M for 24 h [91,93].Reddy, et al. [177] have investigated several pure metabolites of A. paniculata, includingbis-andrographolide ether, andrographolide, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide,andrograpanin, 14-deoxyandrographolide, (\u00b1)-5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone and5-Hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone against HIV. Among these compounds, only andro-grapholide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide have demonstrated significantanti-HIV properties with (EC50 = 49.0 mg/mL) and (EC50 = 56.8 mg/mL). However, theseoutcomes were comparatively very less than the standard HIV treatment, azidothymidine(EC50 = 20 ng/mL) used for HIV. They used MT2 cells for the anti-HIV test and founda significant reduction of p24 antigen levels (doses used 5 to 100 mg/mL). The level ofp24 antigen is one of the determinants of the anti-HIV effect since it is a viral protein thatmakes the viral capsid or core, and its expression is highest during the early phase of infec-tion [224]. Andrographolide was also significantly effective to increase CD4+ lymphocytesin HIV patients. HIV RNA copy number was also decreased, but it was not significant [54].Neoandrographolide, another most potent anti-HIV agent, have a unique C3-O-glucosyl moiety which plays a vital role in the inhibition of furin (IC50 = 53.5 \u00b5M). Thisactivity is around 20-fold higher than the andrographolide (IC50 = 1.0 mM and Ki = 200 \u00b5M).Moreover, furin is a protease involved in the proteolysis of HIV envelop polyprotein gp120prior to viral assembly. Gp120 helps viruses to attach to the specific cell surface recep-tor [225]. A derivative of andrographolide called dehydroandrographolide succinic acidmonoester (DASM) was also experimented with in H9 (T-helper-cell line) cells and humanperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reported to have potential anti-HIV activ-ity [178]. DAMS showed immense improved in vitro anti-HIV activity at the concentrationof 50\u2013200 (average, 108) \u00b5g/mL that was nontoxic to the H9 cells. It also demonstratedthe inhibitory effect against HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains. They reported that the subtoxicconcentration of DASM (200\u2013400 \u00b5g/mL) partially interfered with HIV-induced cell fusionand binding of HIV virions to H9 cells. Probably, DASM might also be interfered with HIVreplication by inhibiting HIV infected cell proliferation at another unidentified step(s).Time- and dose-dependent hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication suppressive effect of an-drographolide also reported earlier [194]. The researchers observed the synergistic effect ofandrographolide in combination with IFN-\u03b1, an inhibitor targeting HCV NS3/4A proteaseor NS5B polymerase. The andrographolide\u2019s effect was further linked to the up-regulationof heme oxygenase-1, which led to increased amounts of its metabolite (biliverdin) produc-tion that promoted the antiviral IFN responses inhibited NS3/4A protease activity whicheventually suppressed HCV replication and showed anti-HCV activity [194]. In anotherstudy, dehydroandrographolide and andrographolide isolated from A. paniculata reportedhaving hepatitis C virus (HBV) DNA replication suppressive activity with IC50 values of22.58 54.07 \u00b5M and low SI values of 8.7 and 3.7 [186].Another recent study conducted on human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 pseudovirus(HPV16PsV) to investigate the antiviral effect of andrographolide, it\u2019s derivative- 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide and semi-synthetic analogue- 3,19-isopropylideneandrographolide (IPAD) [226]. They reported that all compounds inhibited HPV16PsVinfection, of which 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide showed the highest potency.Additionally, only andrographolide suppressed the long control region (LCR) transcriptionactivity of HPV16 in transiently transfected C33A cells [226].Chen, et al. [180] reported considerable inhibitory activity (both in vitro and in vivo)of 14-\u03b1\u0301-lipoyl andrographolide (AL-1), a synthetic derivative of andrographolide, againstinfluenza A viruses H5N1, H9N2, and H1N1. It successfully prevents mortality in miceagainst H1N1 infection at the dose of 200 mg/kg/d, and 80% of mice survived at bothdosages of 100 gm/kg/d and 200 gm/kg/d against H9N2 and H5N1 infections. It alsodemonstrated the most effective inhibition of viral adsorption onto red blood cells at theconcentration of 5.3 to 16.8 mM, thereby inhibiting virus transmission to the uninfectedcells. The similar result was observed by Aromdee, et al. [181] for 14-acetyl analogues of an-Life 2021, 11, 348 19 of 39drographolides (14-acetyl-3,9-isopropylideneandrographolide, 14-acetylandrographolide,3,14,19-triacetylandrographolide) against HSV-1 in vitro. These three analogues weregood for blocking viral entry in the pre-infection step. A cyclic dioxane analogue (3,9-isopropylideneandrographolide) was good for inhibiting viral replication at the post-infection level. However, andrographolide exhibited less effective inhibition activityagainst influenza A and HSV-1.Prevention and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not yet suc-cessful since no specific preventive measurement and treatment available. Therefore,searching for potential bioactive compounds from natural sources is an ongoing investi-gation as medicinal plants possess a tremendous antiviral compound. In recent in silicostudies, andrographolide [227], neoandrographolide [228], glycosides 5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-7-O- \u03b2-D-pyran-glycuronate butyl ester [229] and glycoside 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl- an-drographolide [229] have been reported to have a potential role in inhibiting the mainprotease of SARS-CoV-2, including NSP9, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and 6LU7.Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Theirfindings revealed that the andrographolide molecule has good solubility, pharmacody-namics property and target accuracy [230]. In another very recent report also statedthat andrographolide and its derivative-14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide havestrong binding affinities with targets. They can modulate the immune system by regulatingchemokine signaling, Rap1 signaling, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signal-ing, NF-kappa B signaling, RAS signaling, p53 signaling, HIF-1 signaling, and natural killercell-mediated cytotoxicity [231]. A couple of in silico studies suggest strong interactionof andrographolide and its derivatives against COVID-19 associated target proteins andexhibited different immunoregulatory pathways; thus, these metabolites could be potentialcandidates for COVID-19 treatment, and further evaluation in vitro and in vivo wouldbe worthy.5.3. Antifungal EffectsA. paniculata crude extracts have been used for the treatment of fungal infections infolk medicines for centuries. The ethanol crude extract of the whole plant was reported topossess moderate antifungal activity against A. oryzae (60% inhibition) as well as A. niger(<60% inhibition) and Penicillium sp. (<40% inhibition) at 3% (v/v) concentration [232].The hexane and methanol root extracts were evaluated for their antifungal activity againstA. niger and Penicillium chrysogenum. Two concentrations (100 gm/mL and 200 mg/mL)of each extract were studied, which involved determining the inhibition zone diameterfor a specific time. It was found that both extracts exhibited significant inhibition, 13 mmand 12 mm at 200 mg/mL concentration against A. niger and Penicillium chrysogenum,respectively. However, these inhibitions were less than the standard fluconazole, 17 mmand 16 mm at 100 \u00b5g/mL concentration, respectively [206].Sule, et al. [183] first reported on the isolation of antifungal bioactive compounds fromdichloromethane (DCM) and methanol extracts of A. paniculata whole plant. All the isolatedbioactive, 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucosyl-14-deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, showed significant antifungal activity againstMicrosporum canis, A. niger, and C. albicans. MIC values for all antifungal compounds rangedfrom 50 to 150 \u00b5g/mL, and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values ranged from50 to 200 \u00b5g/mL. Among the isolated antifungal substances, 14-deoxyandrographolideexerted the lowest MIC (50 \u00b5g/mL) and MFC (50 \u00b5g/mL) against M. canis, which in-dicates the most potent antifungal activity. It is noted that no anti-fungal activity wasreported against T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum at 250 \u00b5g/mL. Even though differentextracts of A. paniculata reported to have potential anti-fungal activity, the mode of actionsyet underreport.Life 2021, 11, 348 20 of 395.4. Anti-Parasitic EffectsA. paniculata and its bioactive compounds have been tested and found extensiveanti-parasitic activity against various parasites, such as Ascaris lumbricoidis, Plasmodiumfalciparum, P. berghei, Trypanosoma cruzi, etc. The extract and fractions reduced parasitaemialevel in Mastomys natalensis while used in a dose-dependent manner [184]. Misra, et al. [184]have also studied the anti-malarial activity of the four diterpenes-andrographolide, neoan-drographolide, deoxyandrographolide and andrographolide-isolated from A. paniculataand revealed that neoandrographolide (2.5 mg/kg BW) exhibit the highest activity whenadministered by gastric lavage than other diterpenes.The fractions of A. paniculata also possessed significant anti-malarial activity [185]. Themethanol extract was found to have complete inhibition at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL by48 h. Chloroform extract also achieved the same effect by 24 h at only 0.05 mg/mL concen-tration [233]. The isolated andrographolide also exhibited substantial anti-malarial activityagainst the MRC-pf-303 strain of P. falciparum and particularly inhibited the parasites at thering stage [234]. Consequently, the methanol fractions soluble in chloroform were evaluatedas significant inhibition of parasitaemia (74%) at the concentration of 1 mg/mL. Addition-ally, andrographolide showed the highest (53.9%) inhibition of parasitaemia level [235].It has been found that the alcohol rhizome extract possessed significant in vitro ac-tivity against A. lumbricoides [236]. Two reviews were also reported A. paniculata rhizomeexhibited extensive activity against A. lumbricoides [35,36]. Dutta and Sukul [237] have stud-ied in vitro anti-filarial activity of leaves decoctions of A. paniculata against Dipetalonemareconditum and found the decoctions kill microfilaria in 40 min. In vivo study revealed thatmore than 85% of microfilaria in the blood reduced after three subcutaneous injections ofthe extract into infected dogs at 0.06 mL/kg BW.6. Controlled Clinical Trials of A. paniculata Treatment: A Systematic EvaluationA. paniculata and/or its bioactive compounds have been used to treat patients withuncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including common cold, rhinitis,nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, and pharyngotonsillitis. The surrounding bacteria andviruses are the usual source of infection for the URTIs. In the treatment of URTIs, pills(made by whole powdered plant and water) and tablets (water extract of the plant) havebeen used, and the cure rates are 88% and 61%, respectively. The therapeutic effectivenessdiffered mainly due to the preparation method and duration of treatment [36]. Severalrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials proved the efficacy of A. paniculatastandardized extracts and/or andrographolide. Some other bioactive compounds treatvarious infectious diseases associated with cold symptoms and infections caused by virus-like influenza [55\u201360,238\u2013242].Our systemic investigation revealed a total of 41 individual clinical trials after remov-ing the duplicates from three different databases. After critical evaluation, 23 individualtrials (n = 2760) were finally selected for this study which was distributed in 13 differ-ent countries (Figure 6). These included 11 controlled clinical trials of the treatment ofuncomplicated URTIs (eight studies) [56,58\u201360,238\u2013240,242], viral infections (three studies)-influenza (two studies) [55,57] and HIV (1 studies) [54], and one trial focused on theimmunity enhancement [241] that prevent the occurrence of the common cold in a ruralschool-going healthy student (Table 3). The remaining controlled clinical trials are 11 thatcovered the A. paniculata treatment on the healthy volunteers (three studies)-physiologicaleffects [12], semen quality and fertility [243], pharmacokinetics [244], two studies each forulcerative colitis [62,63], arthritis pain [66,245], and other studies include one trial each ofFamilial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) [246], hypertriglyceridemia [64], fatigue [67], type 2diabetes mellitus [61].Our findings depicted that about 52% of controlled clinical trials were conductedto investigate the A. paniculata extracts and their bioactive compounds effects on thedisappearance of common cold, uncomplicated UTRIs symptoms, as well as recoveryfrom viral infections including influenza and HIV (Figure 7). Among these studies, eightLife 2021, 11, 348 21 of 39were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The characteristics of thesestudies and treatment outcomes are shown in Table 3. The details of A. paniculata treatmentoutcomes on the other health conditions and physiological effects on the healthy volunteer(HV) are given in Supplementary Table S3.Figure 6.

Evaluation of A. paniculata Efficacy Against InfectionsEleven randomized, and 1 non-randomized clinical trials (n = 2008) were met inclusioncriteria. The compliance rate of this study was 95.97%. Of these, nine were double-blind,of which eight were placebo-controlled. Others were either simple randomized control orrandomized parallel-group or randomized controlled open-label. Melchior, et al. [240] andKulichenko, et al. [57] included one pilot trial and one main trial in one article. Therefore,we split their findings and presented them separately in Table 3.A comparative, randomized, double-blind study [60] had been done on 152 Thaipatients with pharyngotonsillitis to investigate the efficacy of A. paniculata extracts usingeither paracetamol (3.9 g/day) or encapsulated A. paniculata dried leaves for low dosegroup (LDG) (3 g/day) or high dose group (HDG) (6 g/day) for seven days. There was nosignificant difference in efficacy of relieving fever (p = 0.16) and sore throat (p = 0.49) amongthree groups on day 7. Most of Paracetamol and HDG stopped taking medication on daythree because their symptoms had disappeared. However, LDG patients discontinuedtaking medications due to persistent adverse side effects or worsening symptoms. Theincident of mild or self-limiting side effects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort,dizziness, drowsiness, and malaise) was not statistically significant among the three groups(p = 0.8), and patients were almost equally satisfied with paracetamol and a high doseof A. paniculata treatment. The findings indicated that daily 6 g of A. paniculata driedleaves extracts that contain at least 6% of andrographolide can be replaced by paracetamoltreatment as a standard treatment for the patients with symptoms of pharyngotonsillitis.In a placebo-controlled study conducted by Caceres, Hancke, Burgos and Wikman [241],Kan Jang tablets, a standardized A. paniculata extract, had been administrated to 107 healthystudents in a rural school at a dose of two tablets (200 mg) per day for three months toevaluate the efficacy of Kan Jang to prevent common colds. The common colds weresuccessfully prevented; 2.1-fold higher prevention in the Kan Jang group compared to theplacebo group. The incidence of common colds was 30% (16 out of 54) and 62% (33 out of53) in the Kan Jang group and placebo group, respectively. Melchior, et al. [58] conductedanother similar study on 50 volunteers suffering from common colds and sinusitis usingKan Jang tablets for five days. Both subjective symptoms and duration of the symptomswere significantly reduced; 68% of patients recovered entirely in the Kan Jang group. Incontrast, only 36% of patients recovered in the placebo group.Another randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study on 158 adult patients ofboth sexes used A. paniculata dried extract SHA-10 for five days to investigate the efficacyin plummeting the prevalence and intensity of sign and symptoms of common colds. Theextract (1.2 g/day) showed the ability to reduce the intensity of the symptoms of tiredness,sleeplessness, sore throat, and nasal secretion compared to the placebo group. The intensityof symptoms started to decrease from the second day. All symptoms disappeared on dayfour without showing any adverse effect [242]. In similar two other Swedenian studies, theKan Jang, a standardized extract of A. paniculata in a fixed combination with Eleutherococcussenticosus, has been used three times daily for 3\u20138 days. This study evaluated the efficacy inthe treatment of uncomplicated URTIs on 46 and 179 patients, respectively. The treatmentgroup showed highly significant improvement compared to the placebo group in terms ofboth the total symptom score (p < 0.0006) and total diagnosis score (p < 0.003). In addition,relief of throat symptom was highly significant in both studies [240].A three-arm clinical study has been carried out on 130 children (ages 4\u201311 years)over ten days to evaluate the effects of Kan Jang on uncomplicated respiratory disease-common colds. In the three groups, the control group treated with standard common coldtreatment and the other two groups adjuvant and adjuvant control group treated with KanJang tablets and Immunal (a preparation of Echinacea purpurea L. extract) concomitant tostandard treatment, respectively. The Kan Jang showed more significant effects by the rapidrecovery process. Using a less standard medication, resulting in the symptoms, particularlynasal secretion and congestion, was less severe at an early stage of uncomplicated commoncolds in the Kan Jang treatment group. However, Immunal did not exhibit the same efficacy.Life 2021, 11, 348 25 of 39The use of Kan Jang as an alternative medication was found to be safe and efficacious intreating uncomplicated upper respiratory tract diseases [238].A randomized, controlled clinical study has also been conducted to investigate KanJang\u2019s effects in treating influenza viral infection on 540 patients. In (same as before) group,Kan Jang treated patients recovered very quickly from infections, and Kan Jang reducedthe risk of post-influenza complications. Moreover, patients tolerated the Kan Jang verynicely [57]. In addition, the addition of A. paniculata to paracetamol in influenza patientscould further reduce the severity of influenza symptoms compared to the control groupwho was given paracetamol alone [55].Existing clinical studies showed that A paniculata has a clinical effect on infectiousdiseases and influences several other diseases. A. paniculata can decrease fasting andpostprandial glucose and decrease body mass index in diabetes mellitus patients. A. pan-iculata also influences mild to moderately active ulcerative patient. Administration of1800 mg showed a significant clinical response (rectal bleeding) compared to placebo(p = 0.0183) [61].6.2. Evaluation of Safety of A. paniculata TreatmentThe incidents of the adverse effect of treatment with the natural product are sporadic.To our best knowledge, there was no such severe adverse event reported for A. paniculatatreatment to the drug safety body. Our critical observations revealed that A. paniculatatreatment showed a mild adverse event in some cases. Out of 14 reports (Table 4), sixreports stated (n = 579) that they did not observe any adverse effects (or report not pro-vided). These studies cover only 1991\u20132010. Our systematic investigation did not reveal anyclinical studies conducted from 2010 to now. However, several clinical studies conductedusing A. paniculata extracts or pure compounds on the healthy volunteer to check semenquality [243], pharmacokinetics and tolerance ability [244], ulcerative colitis [62,63], arthri-tis [66,245], fatigue [67], Familial Mediterranean Fever [246], hypertriglyceridemia [64],and type 2 diabetes mellitus [61] (Supplementary Table S3).Saxena, et al. [59] (n = 223) reported mild adverse effect (2.73%): vomiting (1 case),epistaxis (1 case), Urticaria (1 case) and diarrhoea (3 case). Except for vomiting (patient inthe treatment group) and urticaria, all other effects stopped spontaneously without anymedication. Minimal and self-limiting side effects (n = 152) (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdomi-nal discomfort, dizziness, drowsiness, and malaise) were found about 20% in treatment(LDG & HDG) and paracetamol groups (9\u201311 cases) [60]. These are pervasive mild effectsthat usually recovered shortly without any medications. Three cases out of 200 subjectswere also reported mild side effects: increase in nasal discharge and epigastric pain (1),nose blocked (1), and severe headache (1) for the treatment of A. paniculata fixed combina-tion Kan Jang in URTIs and sinusitis [239]. For viral infections, the treatment group (KanJang) experienced dry cough, rhinitis, and pain in the throat (22 cases out of 540). Controlgroup received antiviral agent amantadine which showed significantly (p < 0.01) higher(67.8% cases) influenza complications compared to treatment group (30.1% cases) [57].For main trials, influenza complications were found in 31.43% of A. paniculata treatedpatients and 70.97% of standard medicine (amantadine) treated patients (p < 0.01). oneHIV positive experience an anaphylactic reaction in phase I clinical trials [54]. All but one(92%) reported at least one adverse event during the study. About 75% reported an adverseevent by the healthy volunteer. All conditions were returned to normal by week 9 [54]. A.paniculata standardized extract treatment of uncomplicated acute URTI patient experiencedunpleasant sensations in the chest and intensified headache (1 case out of 180) [240], andfor common cold and sinusitis, two patients out of 50 experienced urticaria [58].Clinical studies other than respiratory infections also reported no adverse effectsor mild effects. Only two patients (n = 180) with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitisexperienced severe adverse effects [63]. However, clinical response was significantly higherin the A. paniculata group than in the placebo (p = 0.0183). The best efficacy was observedwith the HDG of A. paniculata. In another clinical trial with ulcerative colitis (n = 108),Life 2021, 11, 348 26 of 39both A. paniculata extract-treated group and control group experiences several side effects,including aphthous ulcer (1), WBC decrease (1), abdominal pain (1), blood in the stool (1),fever (1), elevated glucose (1), rash (1) [treatment group]; blood in the urine (2), elevatedCRP (1), WBC decrease (1), blood in the urine (2), fever (1), WBC decrease (1), abdominalpain (1), dry mouth (1), oedema lower extremity (1) cough (2), diarrhoea (2), dizzinessand nausea (1), WBC elevated in urine (1) and other [control group], where comparativelytreatment groups showed less adverse effects [62]. This indicated that the drug tolerancecapacity of ulcerative patients is less regardless type of drugs, and they should be takenprecaution measurement before taking any medicine, including A. paniculata.Considering the type of adverse events and frequency and overall efficacy in treatingsubjective symptoms of common cold or URTIs either alone or in combination with Acan-thopanax senticosus, A. paniculata might be safe for both adults and children. However, thetreatment must need to follow the prescribed regime and daily recommended dose. Basedon the findings of this study, 90\u2013150 mg andrographolide daily could be recommended as asafe dose for the treatment of URTIs and other similar complications. Additionally, URTIspatients with ulcerative colitis should take extensive precaution taking any medications,and they are not recommended or encouraged for self-medication of any herbal drugs,including A. paniculata.Life 2021, 11, 348 27 of 39Table 4.

In the aforementioneddatabases, other relevant papers from the list of references of all available articles weresearched. For searching the controlled clinical trials, the following keywords: \u201cantipara-sitic\u201d, \u201cclinical trials\u201d, \u201ccontrolled clinical trials\u201d, and \u201crandomized clinical trials\u201d wereused in PubMed, Scopus, and web of science. Controlled clinical trials were systematicallyscreened and selected for further evaluation of their outcomes in this study. The studieswere selected for this review (clinical section) if they were controlled clinical trials dealingwith A. paniculata to treat infections incredibly uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infec-tion. Used of A. paniculata for other health conditions and healthy volunteers were alsoselected in this study. English language only restriction was imposed.8. Conclusions and RecommendationsHuman invasive microbes are growing resistant to the available antibiotics for manyreasons. As A. paniculata works on immune regulation, there are fewer chances of drug-resistance occurrence. Even though A. paniculata has a potential antimicrobial activity, thedetailed study regarding the mode of actions, effects concerning the available antimicro-bial agents and specific administration route as well as schedule remain to be explored.The active constituents of A. paniculata could be a potential source of antimicrobial agent,and exploring the therapeutic potentiality of them based on the clinical implications areworthwhile. We have explored substantial antimicrobial agents in A. paniculata (Table 1);however, very little is still known about their molecular mechanisms in response to mi-crobes or host-infected cells. A majority of metabolites are not investigated to identify themolecular target to understand the drug-target-disease network. In addition, our checklistof secondary metabolites of A. paniculata (Supplementary Table S2) can be used for furtherexploration of their effectiveness because about 44% of metabolites are yet to be evaluated.The outcomes from clinical effects suggest that A. paniculata offers a promising treat-ment for alleviating symptoms of infections caused by bacteria or virus that appeared inthe URTIs. Nevertheless, a few common mild adverse events were reported from bothshort term and long term treatments. Therefore, self-medication using A. paniculata shouldbe cautious to avoid potential adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea etc. If we considerthe overall efficacy of A. paniculata treatment, it would be a worthy consideration as anatural product treatment option for acute URTIs as currently, there is a lack of compellingtherapeutic opportunity for IDs.In some cases, pure compounds from medicinal plants, such as aristolochic acids,possess severe side effects like kidney failure and urinary tract cancers [247]. Therefore,moving forward, the further requires us to take a more comprehensive approach to harnessthe true potential of A. paniculata for IDs fully. Different disease conditions have diverseresponses to the drugs; therefore, to obtain a complete picture of the drug-target-disease net-work, elucidating each secondary metabolite\u2019s mechanism(s) is crucial. Andrographolidehas the potential to target multiple sites since it has shown significant efficacy againstdifferent disease conditions. Therefore, this natural product could be considered as apotential candidate for polypharmacology. We would obtain the full advantage of usingandrographolide for therapeutics in the near future.Life 2021, 11, 348 30 of 39Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life11040348/s1, Table S1.
