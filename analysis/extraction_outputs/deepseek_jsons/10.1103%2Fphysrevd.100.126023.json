Smoluchowski Institute of Physics and Mark Kac Center for Complex Systems Research, Jagiellonian University, 30\u2013348 Krako\u00b4w, Poland Ismail Zahed\u2021 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794-3800, USA (Dated: April 15, 2019) We provide a holographic description of non-strange multiquark exotics as compact topological molecules by binding heavy-light mesons to a tunneling configuration in D8-D8\u00af that is homotopic to the vacuum state with fixed Chern-Simons number. In the tunneling process, the heavy-light mesons transmute to fermions. Their binding is generic and arises from a trade-off between the dipole attraction induced by the Chern-Simons term and the U(1) fermionic repulsion. In the heavy quark limit, the open-flavor tetraquark exotics QQq\u00afq\u00af and Q\u00afQ\u00afqq, emerge as bound Efimov states in a degenerate multiplet IJpi = (00+, 01+) with opposite intrinsic Chern-Simons numbers \u00b1 1 2 . The hidden-flavor tetraquark exotics such as QQ\u00afqq\u00af, QQQ\u00afq\u00af and QQQ\u00afQ\u00af as compact topological molecules are unbound. Other exotics are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION Several experimental collaborations [1\u20134] have re- ported new multiquark exotic states such as the neutral X(3872) and the charged Zc(3900) \u00b1 and Zb(10610)\u00b1, a priori outside the canonical quark model classifica- tion. More recently, the LHCb [4] has reported new pentaquark states P+c (4380) and P + c (4450) through the decays \u039b0b \u2192 J\u03a8pK\u2212, J\u03a8ppi\u2212 [5], and five narrow and neutral excited \u21260c baryon states that decay primarily to \u039e+c K \u2212 [6]. Some of the reported hidden-flavor tetraquark exotics appear to be loosely bound hadronic molecules of two heavy-light mesons [7\u201314], although other explanations for their composition have been also suggested in [16\u2013 18]. The first estimates of the open-flavor and compact tetraquark exotics were made in the context of the bag model [19], and the random instanton model with full chiral and heavy quark symmetry in [20, 21], in line with recent estimates using constituent quark models [22]. The reported pentaquark states with hidden charm ini- tially suggested in [23], have been addressed by many [24\u2013 27] including the newly reported neutrals \u21260c as discussed in [28\u201331]. Given the difficulty to track QCD in the in- frared, it is not easy to identify a first principle mecha- nism for the formation of these multiquark states. Most of the multiquark states reported so far involve \u2217Electronic address: yizhuang.liu@sjtu.edu.cn \u2020Electronic address: maciej.a.nowak@uj.edu.pl \u2021Electronic address: ismail.zahed@stonybrook.edu both heavy and light quarks but fall outside the realm of the canonical quark model [22]. It is well established that the light quark sector of QCD exhibits spontaneous chi- ral symmetry breaking, while the heavy quark sector is characterized by heavy quark symmetry [32]. Both sym- metries are at the origin of the chiral doubling suggested in heavy-light mesons [33, 34], and confirmed experimen- tally in [35, 36]. It is therefore important that a the- oretical approach to the multiquark states should have manifest chiral and heavy quark symmetry, a clear orga- nizational principle in the infrared, and should address concisely the multi-body bound state problem. The holographic principle in general [37\u201339], and the D4-D8-D8\u00af holographic set up in particular [40] provide a framework for addressing QCD in the infrared in the dou- ble limit of a large number of colors and strong coupling \u03bb = g2YMNc. It is confining and exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking geometrically. In leading or- der in 1/\u03bb, the light meson sector is well described by an effective action on the fused D8-D8\u00af branes that is consistent with known effective theories [41]. The same setup can be minimally modified to account for the de- scription of heavy-light mesons as well, with full account of heavy quark symmetry [42]. Light and heavy-light baryons are dual to instantons and instanton-heavy me- son bound states in bulk [42\u201348], providing a concise ap- proach to the multi-body bound state problem. In a way, the holographic construction provides a geometrical real- ization of the Skyrmion and its variants [25, 49, 50], with- out the shortcomings of the derivative expansion. Alter- native holographic models for the description of heavy hadrons have been developed in [51\u201353] without the dual strictures of chiral and heavy quark symmetrty. ar X iv :1 90 4. 05 18 9v 2 [h ep -p h] 1 2 A pr 20 19 2The organization of the paper is as follows: in sec- tion 2 we recall the geometrical setup for the derivation of the heavy-light effective action with two light and one heavy flavor. We detail the heavy-light Dirac-Born-Infeld (hereafter DBI) action and the particular classical fields of interest for the description of the holographic multi- quark states. In section 3 we derive explicitly a class of O(4) tunneling configurations with fixed Chern-Simons (hereafter CS) number in D8-D8\u00af, that interpolate contin- uously between a unit topological charge (fermion) and zero topological charge (boson). We also derive their associated fermionic zero modes. In section 4, we de- tail how a heavy meson attached to the tunneling con- figuration transmutes to a fermion. We also derive the pertinent Hamiltonian on the moduli associated to the topological molecule formed of heavy mesons attached to the O(4) tunneling configuration. In the heavy quark limit, the open-flavor and non-strange tetraquarks and hexaquarks are found to be bound Efimov-like states. The hidden-flavor tetraquarks are not bound. In gen- eral, heavier exotics are not bound. Our conclusions are in section 5. We provide two appendices for complete- ness. II. HOLOGRAPHIC HEAVY-LIGHT EFFECTIVE ACTION A. D-brane set up The D4-D8-D8\u00af setup for light flavor branes is stan- dard [40]. The minimal modification that accomodates heavy mesons makes use of an extra heavy brane as dis- cussed in [42]. It consists of Nf light D8-D8\u00af branes (L) and one heavy (H) probe brane in the cigar-shaped ge- ometry that spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry. A schematic description of the set up for Nf = 2 is shown in Fig. 1. We assume that the L-brane world volume con- sists of R4 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S4 with [0\u2212 9]-dimensions. The light 8-branes are embedded in the [0\u22123+5\u22129]-dimensions and set at the antipodes of S1 which lies in the 4-dimension. The warped [5\u2212 9]-space is characterized by a finite size R and a horizon at UKK . B. DBI action The effective action on the probe L-branes consists of the non-Abelian DBI and CS action. After integrating over the S4, the leading contribution in 1/\u03bb to the DBI action is SDBI \u2248 \u2212\u03ba \u222b d4xdzTr (f(z)F\u00b5\u03bdF \u00b5\u03bd + g(z)F\u00b5zF \u03bdz) (1) The warping factors are FIG. 1: Nf = 2 antipodal 8L light branes, and one 8H heavy brane shown in the \u03c4U plane, with a bulk O(4) symmetric tunneling configuration with a turning point, embedded in 8L and a massive HL-string connecting them. f(z) = R3 4Uz , g(z) = 9 8 U3z UKK (2) with U3z = U 3 KK + UKKz 2, and \u03ba \u2261 a\u03bbNc and a = 1/(216pi3) [40]. Our conventions are (\u22121, 1, 1, 1, 1) with A\u2020M = \u2212AM and the labels M,N running over \u00b5, z only in this section. All units are given in terms of MKK = 1, which is readily recovered by dimensional inspection. The effective fields in the field strengths are [42] FMN =( FMN \u2212 \u03a6[M\u03a6\u2020N ] \u2202[M\u03a6N ] +A[M\u03a6N ] \u2212\u2202[M\u03a6\u2020N ] \u2212 \u03a6\u2020[MAN ] \u2212\u03a6\u2020[M\u03a6N ] ) (3) The matrix valued 1-form gauge field is A = ( A \u03a6 \u2212\u03a6\u2020 0 ) (4) For Nf = 2, the naive Chern-Simons 5-form is SCS = iNc 24pi2 \u222b M5 Tr ( AF 2 \u2212 1 2 A3F + 1 10 A5 ) (5) We note that for only Nf > 2 it fails to reproduce the cor- rect transformation law under the combined gauge and chiral transformations [46]. In particular, when address- ing the Nf = 3 baryon spectra, (5) does not treproduce 3the important hypercharge constraint [46], but can be minimally modified to do that. ForNf coincidental branes, the \u03a6 multiplet is massless, but for separated branes as illustrated in Fig. 1 they are massive with the additional contribution 1 2 m2HTr ( \u03a6\u2020M\u03a6M ) (6) The value of mH is related to the separation between the light and heavy branes, which is about the length of the HL string. Below, mH will be taken as the heavy meson mass. C. Light fields In the coincidental brane limit, light baryons are in- terchangebly described as a flavor instanton or a D4 brane wrapping the S4. The instanton size is small with \u03c1 \u223c 1/\u221a\u03bb after balancing the order \u03bbNc bulk gravita- tional attraction with the subleading and of order \u03bb0Nc U(1) induced topological repulsion [40]. To describe tetraquark states which carry zero topolog- ical charge or baryon number, but are still tightly bound by the underlying light gauge field in holography, we sug- gest to use a tunneling configuration on the sphaleron path that is homotopic to the vacuum state. The config- uration will carry fixed Chern-Simons number. We will seek it using the maximally symmetric O(4) gauge field AM (y) = \u2212\u03c3MN\u2202NF (y) Fzm(y)||y|=R = 0 (7) subject to the condition of zero \u2032electric\u2032 field strength at the turning point R = \u03c1. From here on M,N runs only over 1, 2, 3, z unless specified otherwise. If \u03c1 \u223c 1/\u221a\u03bb is the typical size of these tunneling configuations, then it is natural to recast the DBI action using the rescaling (x0, xM )\u2192 (x0, xM/ \u221a \u03bb), \u221a \u03bb\u03c1\u2192 \u03c1 (A0, AM )\u2192 (A0, \u221a \u03bbAM ) (8) The rescaled fields satisfy the equations DMFMN = 0 \u2202 2 MA0 = \u2212 1 32pi2a FaMN ? FaMN (9) with the use of the Hodge dual notation, subject to the turning point condition (7) in leading order in 1/\u03bb. The detailed solution to (9) will be given below. Unlike the instanton which is stable, these tunneling configurations are unstable and tend to relax to the vacuum state. They are the O(4) analogue of an instanton-anti-instanton con- figuration running to its demise through the valley. Be- low, we will show that they can stabilize quantum me- chanically when heavy mesons bind to them. D. Heavy-light fields Let (\u03a60,\u03a6M ) be the pair of heavy quantum fields that bind to the tunneling configuration above. If again \u03c1 \u223c 1/ \u221a \u03bb is their typical size, then it is natural to recast the heavy-light part of the DBI action using the additional rescaling (\u03a60,\u03a6M )\u2192 (\u03a60, \u221a \u03bb\u03a6M ) (10) The interactions between the light gauge fields (A0, AM ) and the heavy fields (\u03a60,\u03a6M ) to quadratic order split to several contributions [42] L = aNc\u03bbL0 + aNcL1 + LCS (11) which are quoted in the Appendix for completeness. Here we only need the leading contributions stemming from (11) in the additional heavy mass limit mH \u2192 \u221e. For that, we split \u03a6M = \u03c6Me \u2212imHx0 for particles (mH \u2192 \u2212mH for anti-particles). The leading order contribution takes the form L0 = \u22121 2 |fMN \u2212 ?fMN |2 + 2\u03c6\u2020M (FMN \u2212 ?FMN )\u03c6N (12) subject to the constraint equation DM\u03c6M = 0 with fMN = \u2202[M\u03c6N ] +A[M\u03c6N ] (13) while the subleading contributions in (11) to order \u03bb0mH simplify to L1 aNc \u2192 4mH\u03c6\u2020M iD0\u03c6M LCS \u2192 mHNc 16pi2 \u03c6\u2020M ? FMN\u03c6N (14) For self-dual light gauge fields with FMN = ?FMN , the last contribution in (12) vanishes, and the minimum is reached for fMN = ?fMN . This observation when combined with the transversality condition for DM\u03c6M = 0, amounts to a first order equation for the combination \u03c8 = \u03c3\u00afM\u03c6M with \u03c3M = (i, ~\u03c3), i.e. \u03c3MDM\u03c8 = D\u03c8 = 0 (15) as noted in [42]. In a self-dual gauge configuration, the heavy spin-1 meson transmutes to a massless spin- 12 spinor that is BPS bound in leading order. For the tun- neling configuration in (7) the self-duality condition no longer holds. With this in mind, we now proceed to deter- mine first the explicit tunneling configuration (A0, AM ) by solving (9), and then its variational zero mode. 4III. TUNNELING FIELD AND ITS FERMIONIC ZERO MODE In this section we detail the construction of a family of O(4) symmetric tunneling configurations (7) solution to (9). They carry fractional Chern-Simons number at the turning point, and interpolate parametrically between the instanton and the sphaleron configuration at the turning point when continued to Minkowski space. Their O(3) symmetric relatives through a conformal transfor- nation are discussed in the Appendix. We note that similar configurations were used in the context of ex- plosive sphalerons and their applications to finite energy collisions [54\u201356]. We also derive their corresponding fermionic zero modes, which will prove useful for the dis- cussion of the heavy-meson bound states through trans- mutation. A. O(4) tunneling configuration Consider the O(4) static and symmetric ansatz for the SU(2) gauge configuration AaM (y) = 2 \u03b7\u00afaMN yN y2 f(\u03be) (16) with the conformal variable \u03be(y) = 12 ln(y 2/\u03c12). The anti- instanton and anti-sphaleron configurations follow from a similar construction with a dual background \u03b7\u00af \u2192 \u03b7. In terms of (16) the static O(4) symmetric part of the Yang-Mills action in (1) without warping reads SDBI \u2192 \u2212\u03baT \u222b d3xdz FaMNFaMN = + 24pi2T g2\u03ba \u222b d\u03be ( f \u20322(\u03be) 2 + V (f(\u03be)) ) (17) with T the length of time, the induced effective coupling for the flavor gauge fields g2\u03ba = 1/\u03ba, and the double well potential V (f) = 2(ff\u00af)2 (18) with f\u00af = 1\u2212f . The O(4) profile f(\u03be) extremizes (17) by satisfying d2f d\u03be2 = 4(f2 \u2212 f)(2f \u2212 1) . (19) which is of the Jacobi type. Remarkably, the solution to (19) with a sphaleron-like turning point at \u03be = 0 with f \u2032(\u03be = 0) = 0, can be found explicitly fk(\u03be) = 1 2 ( 1 + ( 2k2 1 + k2 ) 1 2 sn ( \u03be ( 2 1 + k2 ) 1 2 , k )) (20) with sn the Jacobi sine function. We note that the solu- tion (20) is \u03be-periodic with period Tk = 2K(k) ( 1 + k2 2 ) 1 2 (21) Here K(k) is the elliptic function, and \u03be \u2208 [\u2212Tk2 , Tk2 ]. In Fig. 2 we show (20) for k = 0.1, 0.5, 1. -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 f(\u03be, 0.1) f(\u03be, 0.5) f(\u03be, 1) FIG. 2: fk(\u03be) for k = 0.1, 0.5, 1. The parameter k relates to the sphaleron-like energy at the turning point Ek = 24pi2 g2\u03ba V (fk(\u03be = 0)) = 3pi2 g2\u03ba ( 1\u2212 k2 1 + k2 )2 (22) At k = 0 we recover the expected sphaleron energy E0 = 3pi 2/g2\u03ba with the constant profile f0(\u03be) = 1 2 . At the instanton point k = 1 with zero energy E1 = 0 we recover the instanton interpolating profile f1(\u03be) = 1 2 + 1 2 sn(\u03be, 1) = e2\u03be 1 + e2\u03be (23) as illustrated in Fig. 2. In general, the solution (20) carries Chern-Simons number Nk and energy Ek at the turning point, that are tied through the profile of the potential (18) Nk(1\u2212Nk) = 1 4 ( Ek E0 ) 1 2 (24) with N1 = 1 the instanton topological charge, and N0 = 1 2 the sphaleron Chern-Simons number. Only the solution with N1 = 1 is self-dual. All the other config- urations with Nk < 1 are extrema rather than minima, and therefore prone to decay. They are homotopic to the vacuum state. For the holographic dual hadronic configurations, the more relevant quantity is the action (17) for the gener- alized tunneling configurations (20). Since the solutions are periodic reflecting on the periodicity of the sphaleron- ridge, we have for the fundamental period the action Sk = 24pi2T g2\u03ba \u222b Tk 0 d\u03be ( f \u20322(\u03be) 2 + V (f(\u03be)) ) (25) 5which gives S1 = (8pi 2/g2\u03ba)T at the instanton point as expected, and S0 = 3pi2 g2\u03ba T0T = 3pi3\u221a 2g2\u03ba T (26) at the sphaleron point. In particular, the holographic mass of the tunneling configuration without warping, can be read from (25) as Mk = Sk/T . We note that the holo- graphic mass ratio at the sphaleron to instanton point is M0/M1 = 3pi/8 \u221a 2 < 1. In Fig. 3 we show the mass ratio Mk/M1 = Sk/S1 for different values of 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 Mk/M1 FIG. 3: The mass ratio Mk/M1 versus k. B. U(1) gauge field The U(1) gauge field in (9) is sourced by the local topological charge density carried by the O(4) tunneling configuration (16). For that, it is useful to determine the field strength FMN and its dual ?FMN , or more explicitly the electric and magnetic fields y2 ~E = ~\u03c3 ( f \u2032 \u2212 (~y) 2 y2 (f \u2032 \u2212 2ff\u00af) ) + (~y \u00b7 ~\u03c3~y \u2212 y4~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~y) y2 (f \u2032 \u2212 2ff\u00af) y2 ~B = ~\u03c3 ( 2ff\u00af + (~y)2 y2 (f \u2032 \u2212 2ff\u00af) ) \u2212 (~y \u00b7 ~\u03c3~y \u2212 y4~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~y) y2 (f \u2032 \u2212 2ff\u00af) (27) with Ei = F i4 and Bi = 12\u000f ijkF jk. For self-dual fields f \u2032 = 2ff\u00af and ~E = ~B as expected for the instanton path. The U(1) field satisfies \u22022MA0 = \u2212 3 4pi2ay4 ( 2f \u2032ff\u00af ) (28) which can be inverted if we define A0(y) = 1 y2 \u03c61(\u03be) (29) so that \u03c61(\u03be) is solution to \u03c6\u2032\u20321 \u2212 2\u03c6\u20321 = \u2212 3 4pi2a ( 2f \u2032ff\u00af ) \u2261 F0(\u03be, k) \u2261 \u2212 3 4pi2a F0(\u03be, k) (30) which is sourced by the topological charge density. The net topological charge is Qtop(k) = 3 \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 d\u03be F0(\u03be, k) (31) Note that F0(\u03be, k) is a total derivative as it should, F0(\u03be, k) = ( f2 \u2212 2 3 f3 )\u2032 (32) which is identically zero at the sphaleron point since f0 = 1 2 . (31) is monotonous in k as shown in Fig. 4. It interpolates continuously between the sphaleron path at k = 0 with zero topological charge, and the instanton path at k = 1 with unit topological charge. Eq. (30) is readily solved using \u03c61(\u03be) = C1 + C2e +2\u03be + 1 2 \u222b \u03be \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1(e +2\u03be\u22122\u03be1 \u2212 1)F0(\u03be1, k) (33) The constants of integration C1,2 can be fixed by choosing the solution to satisfy the zero boundary condition at \u03be = \u2212Tk2 and the regular boundary condition at \u03be = Tk2 . This means that \u2212C2 = eTkC1 = 1 2 \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 e\u22122\u03be1F0(\u03be1, k)d\u03be1 (34) which explicitly gives \u03c61(\u03be) = + 1 2 \u222b \u03be \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1(e +2\u03be\u22122\u03be1 \u2212 1)F0(\u03be1, k) \u22121 2 (e2\u03be \u2212 e\u2212Tk) \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 e\u22122\u03be1F0(\u03be1, k)d\u03be1 (35) 60.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Qtop(k) FIG. 4: Topological charge versus k. C. O(4) fermionic zero mode The zero mode solution in the O(4) configuration (1) solves the Dirac equation (\u2202M \u2212 iAM ) \u03b3M \u03c8 = 0 (36) In the chiral basis with spin matrices \u03c3\u00afMs = (1,\u2212i~\u03c3s) and \u03b35 = ( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) \u03b3\u00b5 = ( 0 \u03c3Ms \u03c3\u00afMs 0 ) (37) (36) splits into two chirality modes \u03c8\u00b1 each conjugate of the other. Note the difference between the preceding conventions and the hermiticity of the gauge field in this section only. If we note that the t\u2032 Hooft symbol satisfies the color identity \u03c3\u00afMc\u03c3Nc = \u03c3ac\u03b7aMN (38) with the color matrices \u03c3Mc = (1,\u2212i~\u03c3c), then the posi- tive chirality mode associated to (36) satisfies ( \u03c3\u00afMs\u2202M + 1 2 \u03c3\u00afNs\u03c3\u00afNc \u03c3Mc\u2202M F ) \u03c8+ = 0 (39) with the spin and color matrices commuting, and F (\u03be) following from (16) F (\u03be(y)) = 2 \u222b \u03be(y) 0 d\u03be\u2032f(\u03be\u2032) (40) Note that while writing (39) we have added a U(1) part to the gauge field for notational simplicity. It will be removed in the final step below. Eq. (39) can be solved formally using \u03c8+ = \u03d5\u03c7Q (\u03c7Q)a\u00b5 = \u000fa\u00b5 (41) wich is a singlet in color-spin space that satisfies \u03c3Ms\u03c7Q = \u03c3\u00afMc\u03c7Q \u03c3\u00afMs\u03c7Q = \u03c3Mc\u03c7Q (42) Using (41-42) in (39) yield ( \u03c3\u00afMs\u2202M + 1 2 \u03c3\u00afNs\u03c3Ns \u03c3\u00afMs\u2202M F ) \u03d5\u03c7Q = 0 (43) It is here that we need to remove the U(1) contribution noted above through the substitution \u03c3\u00afNs\u03c3Ns \u03c7Q = ( 1 + (~\u03c3s) 2 ) \u03c7Q \u2192 (~\u03c3s)2\u03c7Q = 3\u03c7Q (44) leading to the O(4) symmetric equation for the zero mode amplitude \u03d5\u2032 + 3 2 F \u2032\u03d5 = 0 (45) The spinor zero-mode of positive parity is \u03c8+(y) = C e \u2212 32F (\u03be(y))\u03c7Q \u2261 f0(y)\u03c7Q (46) with the normalization constant fixed within Tk C = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b Tk d4y e\u22123F (\u03be(y)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 12 (47) IV. MULTIQUARK EXOTICS AS TOPOLOGICAL MOLECULES In the triple limit of a large number of colors Nc, strong coupling \u03bb and heavy meson mass mH , the holographic multiquark exotics can be constructed by attaching to the O(4) tunneling gauge configuration an arbitrary number of heavy-light mesons. Of course, in reality only a few can stick. The fermionic repulsion induced through a U(1) coupling to the Chern-Simons term stabilizes the tunnel- ing configurations viewed as an instanton-anti-instanton process. A. Heavy bound meson For k = 1 with net topological charge 1, the heavy me- son field in the self-dual classical background (7) trans- mutes to a fermionic zero mode (15) as initially noted in [42]. For k < 1 which is the case of interest with frac- tional topological charge (fixed Chern-Simons number), the classical background (7) is no longer self-dual and the minimum of (12) can be solved using a variational fermionic ansatz of the type (15) 7\u03c6M \u2192 \u03c3M\u03c8+ \u2261 \u03c3Mg(r)\u03c7Q (48) with the radial coordinate r = |y|. In terms of (48) the leading contribution to the action S0 associated to L0 in (11) is S0 = \u2212 \u222b d4y ( f\u2020MNfMN + 2\u03c6 \u2020 MFMN\u03c6N ) = \u2212 \u222b 2pi2dr (6S0(g(r))) \u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q (49) with S0(g) = r3 ( g\u20322 + 2gg\u2032G+ g2 ( \u22122G\u2032 \u2212 6G r + 9G2 )) (50) Here g\u2032 = dg/dr, G(r) = f/r and G\u2032 = dG/dr with the background gauge field expressed in the r-coordinate AM = \u2212\u03c3\u00afMN yM r G(r) (51) The local minimum for S0(g) requires that g(r) satisfies g\u2032\u2032 + 3 5 g\u2032 \u2212 ( \u22123G\u2032 \u2212 9G r + 9G2 ) g = 0 (52) A special solution to (52) is of the form g(r) = e\u22123 \u222b r 0 dr\u2032G(r\u2032) = e\u2212 3 2F (\u03be) (53) which is readily seen to satisfy g\u2032 + 3Gg = 0 g\u2032\u2032 + 3G\u2032g + 3Gg\u2032 = 0 (54) and therefore( g\u2032 + 3Gg ) + ( 3 r \u2212 3G )( g\u2032\u2032 + 3G\u2032g + 3Gg\u2032 ) = g\u2032\u2032 + 3 r g\u2032 + ( \u2212 3G\u2032 \u2212 9G r + 9G2 ) g = 0 (55) which is (52). We note that for k = 1 which corresponds to the instanton path, Eq. (53) reduces to the standard fermionic zero mode (r2 + \u03c12)\u2212 3 2 . (48) with (53) is trans- verse DM\u03c6M = 0 for all values of k. In [42] \u03c7Q \u2192 \u03c7Q(t) describes the induced fermionic moduli upon binding, which is how the heavy quark of the original heavy-light meson manifests itself in this limit. B. Action for the topological molecule With the above in mind, and following the arguments presented in [42] (see section VB), the pertinent contri- butions to the action for the topological molecule to order \u03bb0mH is Sk aNc \u2248 \u222b dt ( Mk aNc \u2212 16m2H\u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q ) + \u222b dt d4y ( 16mH g 2(r)\u03c7\u2020Qi\u2202t\u03c7Q + mH 8api2 \u000fMNPQ\u03c6 \u2020 MFNP\u03c6Q ) + SC(A0) (56) with the U(1) Coulomb contribution SC(A0 = i\u03c8) =\u222b ( 1 2 (\u2207\u03c8)2 + \u03c8 ( \u03c10[A]\u2212 16mHg2(r)\u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q )) (57) due to the attraction induced by the Chern-Simons den- sity \u03c10(A) and the self-repulsion. More explicitly, we have SC(A0) = 16mH\u03c7 \u2020 Q\u03c7Q \u222b g2(r)(\u2212iAcl0 ) \u2212\u03b1C(16mH\u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q)2 (58) with the Coulomb factor \u03b1C = 1 2 \u222b g2(r) 1 \u2212\u22072 g 2(r) (59) The contribution to (56) \u22122mH(\u03c6\u20200iDM\u03c6M \u2212 c.c) = 0 drops out for any k, thanks to the transversality of the zero-mode (48). We recall that for k = 1 the tunneling configuration is self-dual but not otherwise. This configu- ration is an instanton with topological charge 1, and (56) describes the action of holographic heavy baryons [42]. C. Hamiltonian for the topological molecule The molecular Hamiltonian associated to (56) follows using the canonical rules for \u03c7Q in the form Hk \u2248Mk +mH\u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q + \u03bb\u03b10(k) 16mH\u03c12 \u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q + 3\u03b11(k) 4pi2a\u03c12 \u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q + \u03b12(k) 8pi2aNc\u03c12 (\u03c7\u2020Q\u03c7Q) 2 (60) 8after the rescaling of the fermionic fields \u03c7Q \u2192 1 (16aNcmH) 1 2 \u03c7Q (61) Switching to the conformal coordinate \u03be, and using the explicit profile for the tunneling gauge configuration f(\u03be) in (20), the U(1) gauge field F0(\u03be, k) in (30) and the zero mode g(\u03be) in (53), we obtain for the k-dependent coefficients \u03b10,1,2(k) \u03b10(k) = (\u221212e+2\u03be\u22123F f |\u2202B)(\u222b B d\u03bee4\u03be\u22123F )\u22121 \u03b11(k) = (\u222b B d\u03bee+2\u03be\u22123F ( \u2212\u03c61 \u2212 1 8 ( f \u2032 2 + f\u00aff ))) \u00d7 (\u222b B d\u03bee4\u03be\u22123F )\u22121 \u03b12(k) = (\u222b B d\u03bee+2\u03be\u22123F\u03c62 )(\u222b B d\u03bee4\u03be\u22123F )\u22122 (62) As a reminder, the functions \u03c61,2 are explicitly given by \u03c61(\u03be) = 1 2 \u222b \u03be \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1 (e 2(\u03be\u2212\u03be1) \u2212 1)F0(\u03be1, k) \u22121 2 (e2\u03be \u2212 e\u2212Tk) \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1e \u22122\u03be1F0(\u03be1, k) \u03c62(\u03be) = \u22121 2 \u222b \u03be \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1 (e 2(\u03be\u2212\u03be1) \u2212 1) e2\u03be1\u22123F (\u03be1,k) + 1 2 (e2\u03be \u2212 e\u2212Tk) \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 d\u03be1e \u22123F (\u03be1,k) (63) We fix the region of integration B to the period Tk in (21) or B = [\u2212Tk2 , Tk2 ], with the boundary conditions specified earlier. The integrals in (62) for \u03b11,2(k) are not reducible to single integrals upon the insertion of (63) and integra- tion by parts, since e2\u03be\u22123F does not integrate to a simple function. The first contribution in (60) is the holographic mass (25) of the tunneling configuration of order \u03bbNc, which is seen to reduce to the instanton mass (action) for k = 1. The second contribution is the mass of the attached heavy quarks in the mesonic molecule. The contribution linear in \u03bb stems from the boundary term for the quadratic heavy meson action. It is non-zero for 0 \u2264 k < 1 due to the deviation of the tunneling gauge configuration from self-duality. The \u03b11 contri- bution stems from the U(1) Coulomb coupling of the charge \u03c7\u2020\u03c7 to the background charge \u03c10 and the Chern- Simons terms.The (\u03c7\u2020\u03c7)2 contribution stems from the U(1) Coulomb-like self-interaction. All of these contri- butions are similar to the k = 1 case with the exception of the \u03b10-contribution. The behavior of \u03b10,1,2(k) versus k is shown in Figs. 5-7 respectively. Eq. \u03b10(k) is maximally repulsive at k = 0 reflecting on the maximal deviation from self-duality, and vanishes at the self-dual point with k = 1 in agreement with [42]. Eq. \u03b11(k) is attractive for all k with the ex- pected value \u03b11(1) = \u2212 18 from [42]. Eq, \u03b12(k) is repulsive throughout with the limiting value \u03b12(1) = 1 3 in agree- ment with [42]. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 1 2 3 4 5 \u03b10(k) FIG. 5: \u03b10(k) versus k. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k -0.12 -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 \u03b11(k) FIG. 6: \u03b11(k) versus k. D. Classical binding energy In general the treatment of the size \u03c1 requires quantum mechanics as we detail below. However, for a classical estimate, we note that since the dependence of Mk versus k is mild as seen in Fig. 3 with a size of order (\u03bbNc) 0/ \u221a \u03bb, we may fix it near the instanton point at k \u223c 1 with the result [44, 45] \u03c12 = 27pi \u03bb \u221a 6 5 (64) 90.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 0.20 0.25 0.30 \u03b12(k) FIG. 7: \u03b12(k) versus k. in units of MKK . If NQ = \u03c7 \u2020 Q\u03c7Q is the number of heavy quarks (mesons) attached to the tunneling configuration, their classical binding energy \u2206H(k) as a function of k follows from (60) as (M1 = 8pi 2\u03ba) \u2206H(k) \u2261 (Hk \u2212NQmH) \u2261 Mk + ( \u03bb\u03b10(k) 16mH + 162pi\u03b11(k) ) NQ \u03c12 +27pi\u03b12(k) N2Q Nc\u03c12 (65) We fix the holographic parameters to: Nc = 3, \u03bb = 20 [44, 57] and MKK = m\u03c1/ \u221a 0.67 \u2248 1 GeV [44]. For NQ = 2, we show in Fig. 8 the classical binding energy \u2206H(0) versus mH in units of MKK . We recall that k = 0 corresponds to the sphaleron path with zero topologi- cal charge. For charm and bottom, mH is fixed to the (0\u2212, 1\u2212) multiplet, i.e. mD \u2248 1.870 GeV for (D,D\u2217) and mB \u2248 5.279 GeV for (B,B\u2217). The classical binding of both charm and bottom is large and depends sensi- tively on the value of \u03c1. In the heavy quark limit with mH \u2192 \u221e, the classical binding disappears when the re- pulsion (\u03b12) exceeds the attraction (\u03b11) modulo Mk, i.e. NQ/Nc > 6|\u03b11(0)|/\u03b12(0) \u2248 1.22. A more accurate esti- mate of the binding requires a quantum treatment as we now discuss. E. Quantum moduli The quantum moduli space of the O(4) tunneling configurations is analogous to the instanton moduli or R4 \u00d7 R4/Z2 (flat space) [40]. Here we focus on R4/Z2 which corresponds to the size and global flavor SU(2) orientations.We will refer to yI = \u03c1aI as the coordinates on R4/Z2, with the SU(2) orientations parametrized by aI subject to the normalization a 2 I = 1, and to \u03c1 as the size of the instanton.

Here q(k) is the U(1) topological self-repulsion in the absence of the heavy mesons q(k) = \u221245 2 \u222b Tk 2 \u2212Tk2 e\u22122\u03be\u03c61(\u03be)F0[\u03be, k] (68) In Fig 9 we show (68) versus k, which is seen to increase monotonously with the topological charge, from q(0) = 0 on the sphaleron path to q(1) = 1 on the instanton path [42]. All contributions in (67) are in principle leading in the triple limit Nc > \u03bb > mH 1 provided that NQ/Nc is of order 1. However, in practice some of the the inequalities may not be fulfilled. This is a known shortcoming of the holographic construction, where for instance \u03bb > Nc is used in most applications [40, 44, 57]. For NQ = 0, the eigenstates of (66) are given by Tl(a)Rln, where Tl(a) are the spherical harmonics on S 3 with \u22072Tl = \u2212l(l + 2)Tl. Under SO(4)\u223c SU(2)xSU(2) they are in the ( l2 , l 2 ) representations, with the two SU(2) identified by the isometry aI \u2192 VLaIVR. The left factor 10 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 q(k) FIG. 9: U(1) self-repulsion q(k) versus k. is the isospin rotation and the right factor is the space rotation with quantum numbers I = J = l2 . For NQ 6= 0, the isospin (I) and the spin (J) decouple with the identification [42] J = \u2212I+ \u03c7\u2020QT\u03c7Q (69) The isospin-spin representations are now IJ \u2261 ( l 2 , l 2 ) \u2192 \uf8eb\uf8ed l 2 , l 2 NQ\u2295 i=1 1 2 \uf8f6\uf8f8 (70) F. Multiquark exotics The radial equation for the reduced wavefunction Rnl = unl/\u03c1 3 2 following from (66) now reads \u2212u\u2032\u2032nl + gl(k) \u03c12 unl + (mk\u03c9k\u03c1) 2 unl = ek,nl unl (71) with gl(k) = l(l + 2) + 2mkQ(k) (72) and ek,nl = 2mk(Ek,nl \u2212Mk \u2212 NQmH). The quantum corrected classical binding energy (65) is now \u2206H(k)\u2192 \u2206k = Ek,nl \u2212NQmH = Mk + ek,nl 2mk (73) The occurence of the 1/\u03c12 potential at short distances, stems from the nature of the attraction in (60) which is dipole-like and the repulsion in (60) which is U(1)- like and Coulombic in 4-spatial dimensions. It is dom- inant at small distances, with the critical coupling of \u2212 14 for the formation of deep bound states below the heavy meson threshold. Throughout, binding means that Ek,nl \u2212NQmH < 0. In Fig. 10 we show the behavior of sl(x) \u2261 gl(0) + 14 as a function of x = NQ/Nc with mH \u2192 \u221e, on the sphaleron path (zero topological charge), for l = 0 lower (blue) curve, l = 1 middle (orange) curve and l = 2 upper (green) curve. Only for l = 0 and x = NQ/Nc < 1.2 is the attraction sufficiently strong to form deep bound states. Higher waves with l = 1, 2, ... are unbound. For Nc = 3, only NQ \u2264 3 states are a priori bound, i.e. open-flavor tetraquark QQq\u00afq\u00af and hexaquark QQQq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af states. The S-wave tetraquark states QQq\u00afq\u00af carry IJpi = 00+, 01+ assignments with Chern-Simons number + 12 , and are de- generate. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 x-2 2 4 6 8 10 sl(x) FIG. 10: sl(x) \u2261 gl(0) + 14 versus x = NQ/Nc for l = 0 lower (blue) curve, l = 1 middle (orange) curve and l = 2 upper (green) curve. G. Efimov states For small distances and S-waves, (71) reduces to \u2212u\u2032\u2032n0 + g0(k) \u03c12 un0 \u2248 ek,n0 un0 (74) For g0(k) + 1 4 < 0, the potential in (74) is sufficiently attractive to form deep bound states. However, it is sin- gular and requires regularization [58]. The scale invari- ance of (74) allows for a universal regularization using the renormalization group approach, whereby the depth of the attractive and singular potential, can be chosen to be a function of a short distance cutoff RS [58]. As a re- sult, (74) admits many S-wave bound states with an accu- mulation near threshold, the so-called Efimov states [59]. We note that in our case, there is a minimal value for the cutoff Rmin = 1/mH , so the number of bound states is limited. The bound state spectrum for (74) was detailed in [58] with extensive analysis in the context of the renormal- ization group cycle, with the result 11 ek,n0 = \u2212 4 r20 e\u03d5k,n \u03d5k,n = ( 2 \u03bdk,x ( C + Im ln \u0393(1 + i\u03bdk,x)\u2212 ( n+ 1 2 ) pi )) \u03bdk,x = ( \u22121 4 \u2212 g0(k) ) 1 2 (75) where x = NQ/Nc. To avoid cluttering the notations, we omitted the x-dependence in all quantities except \u03bdk,x. The behavior of \u03bdk,x versus k is shown in Fig. 11 for Nc = 3, x = 2/3 and mH \u2192 \u221e. The coupling peaks at k = 1 2 , halfway between the instanton and sphaleron path. Consecutive bound state energies are tied geometrically ek,(n+1)0 ek,n0 = e \u2212 2pi\u03bdk,x (76) showing their accumulation or dissipation at threshold ek,00 = 0, i.e. the Efimov effect. The undetermined con- stant C in the quantum spectrum (75) reflects on the sin- gular potential, that warrants renormalization. Chang- ing C amounts to redefining the depth of the singular potential. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 k 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 \u03bdk,2/3 FIG. 11: \u03bdk,2/3 versus k for x = 2 3 and mH \u2192\u221e. In (75) the scale r0 is fixed by the curvature or range of the long distance 1/\u03c12 potential. From (71) we fix it by matching the strength of the short distance potential to the strength of the large distance harmonic potential, i.e. r20 = 1/(mk\u03c91). As a result, the quantum binding energy (73) becomes \u2206k(Nc, x, \u03bb) = Mk \u2212 2\u03c91 e\u03d5k,n = ( \u03bbNc 27pi ) Mk M1 \u2212 \u221a 2 3 e\u03d5k,n (77) For Nc = 3 and at the sphaleron point with k = 0, the binding energy (77) depends on the coupling \u03bb, the oc- cupation ratio x = NQ/Nc < 1.2 and the parameter C (cutoff depth). We fix C so that the binding energy van- ishes for x = 1/3 giving a Qq\u00af meson state of energy exactly mH . With this in mind, (77) reads \u22060(3, \u03bb, x) = \u03bb 24 \u221a 2 \u2212 \u221a 2 3 ( \u03bb \u221a 3 48 )\u03bd0,1/3/\u03bd0,x \u00d7e 2\u03bd0,x (Im Ln \u0393(1+i\u03bd0,x)\u2212Im Ln \u0393(1+i\u03bd0,1/3)) (78) In the heavy quark limit, \u03bd0,1/3 = 1.10, \u03bd0,2/3 = 1.26 and \u03bd0,3/3 = 0.93. 12 14 16 18 20 \u03bb -0.10 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 \u03940(3,x,\u03bb) FIG. 12: Binding energy (78) versus \u03bb for mH \u2192 \u221e: x = 13 green (upper) curve, x = 2 3 lower (orange) curve and x = 3 3 middle (blue) curve. Fig. 12 shows the behavior of the binding energies (78) versus the t\u2032 Hooft coupling \u03bb, for x = 13 upper (green) curve, x = 23 lower (orange) curve and x = 3 3 middle (blue) curve, in the heavy quark limit. For mH \u2192 \u221e, the binding energies of the tetraquark states QQq\u00afq\u00af and hexaquark states QQQq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af are listed in the first column of Table I-II respectively. The binding energies are not very sensitive to 10 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 20. For bottom B-mesons with mB = 5.279 GeV and charmed D-mesons with mD = 1.87 GeV, the binding energies for tetraquark and hexaquark states are also listed in Table I-II respectively. The hexaquark states are unbound for finite masses. We note that for the bound tetraquark states, the Efi- mov factor is e\u22122pi/\u03bd0,2/3 \u2248 10\u22123. This factor in the geometrical ratio (76) shows that the radially excited tetraquark exotics rapidly move to the continuum and unbind. So we expect only one bound state to survive. The heavy multiquark states with hidden-flavor are also covered by the present analysis provided that NQ \u2192 NQ \u2212 NQ\u00af is substituted in (67) when NQ > NQ\u00af. For NQ < NQ\u00af the starting O(4) tunneling configuration should be an anti-instanton path with topological charge \u22121, interpolating to an anti-sphaleron path with Chern- Simons number \u2212 12 . This implies conjugate symmetry for bosonic multiquark states. As a result, the conju- gate tetraquark states Q\u00afQ\u00afqq are bound and degenerate 12 TABLE I: Binding energies for tetraquarks \u03bb QQq\u00afq\u00af GeV bbq\u00afq\u00af GeV bcq\u00afq\u00af GeV ccq\u00afq\u00af GeV 10 \u22120.097 \u22120.088 \u22120.080 \u22120.072 15 \u22120.107 \u22120.091 \u22120.077 \u22120.062 20 \u22120.108 \u22120.085 \u22120.064 \u22120.041 TABLE II: Binding energies for hexaquarks \u03bb QQQq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af GeV bbbq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af GeV bbcq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af GeV cccq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af GeV 10 \u22120.026 \u22120.005 +0.008 +0.037 15 \u22120.029 +0.006 +0.029 +0.076 20 \u22120.029 +0.018 +0.045 +0.084 with QQq\u00afq\u00af. Heavier tetraquark states such as QQQ\u00afQ\u00af with NQ \u2192 NQ \u2212 NQ\u00af = 0 are unbound. Heavier multiquark states of the type QQQ\u00afq\u00af and QQQ\u00afqq\u00afq\u00af with NQ \u2192 NQ \u2212NQ\u00af = 1 are unbound, but those of the type QQ(QQ\u00af)pq\u00afq\u00af with NQ \u2212NQ\u00af = (p+ 2)\u2212 p = 2 are bound in the heavy quark limit. The holographic exotics with hidden-flavor QQ\u00afqq\u00af with NQ \u2192 NQ \u2212 NQ\u00af = 0, are also unbound. Experimental evidence in [1\u20134] suggests otherwise. This shows that the X,Y,Z states reported in [1\u20134] are not the compact topological molecules discussed here, but likely loosely bound hadronic molecules (deusons) [7\u201314]. Finally, we also note that the present analysis is limited to the light SU(2) flavor sector. The extension to the SU(3) flavor sector with massive strange quarks is more involved [42] and will be discussed elsewhere. H. Discussion Recent lattice and phenomenological estimates suggest that the double-bottom tetraquark state is deeply bound with \u2206BB = \u2212(0.15\u22120.2) GeV [60] (lattice) and \u2206BB = \u2212(0.17) GeV [22] (and references therein). The same lattice analysis suggests that the mixed charm-bottom tetraquark state is bound \u2206CB = \u2212(0.061\u2212 0.015) GeV, but the the double-charm tetraquark state is not [60]. Our holographic results support a double-bottom tetraquark state with a binding energy \u2206BB = \u2212(0.088\u2212 0.091) GeV somewhat lower than the lattice estimate, a mixed bottom-charm tetraquark with a binding energy \u2206CB = \u2212(0.064 \u2212 0.080) GeV closer to the lattice esti- mate, and a bound double-charm tetraquark with a bind- ing energy \u2206CC = \u2212(0.041\u2212 0.072) GeV contrary to the lattice estimate. These results are overall consistent with earlier estimates in the context of the random instanton model [21]. Finally, we note that multiquark exotics in the con- text of holography have been recently addressed in the context of the holography inspired stringy hadron model (HISH) [53]. We view our analysis as complementary to the HISH analysis as it applies to the low lying ex- otics as opposed to the highly excited and stringy ex- otics. Our analysis can be extended to the excited and unbound exotic states for slow rotations, with the rotational-vibrational spectrum for l > 0 E0,nl = M0 +NQmH + ( l2 6 + 2Nc 81 Q(0) ) 1 2 + 2n+ 1\u221a 6 (79) following from (66-67) through standard arguments [40, 42]. The states described by (70) are unstable against the strong decay to heavy-light mesons. For l 1 the spectrum (79) does not reggeize since E0,nl \u2248 l. A way to achieve reggeization is through relativistic rotations, that allow for a stringy-like deformation of the underly- ing O(4) tunneling configuration. This will be discussed elsewhere. V. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a top-down holographic approach to multiquark exotic states using a minimally modified D4-D8-D8\u00af set up to account for two light and one heavy flavor [42]. The heavy multiquark states are topological molecules of heavy-light mesons bound to a tunneling gauge configuration with fixed Chern-Simons number. The latter interpolates between an instanton path with net topological charge 1 or baryon number (a fermion), and a sphaleron path with net topological charge 0 and Chern-Simons number 12 (a boson). The geometrical interpolation between a fermion and a boson in higher dimensions, is remarkable. It points to a topological duality between the heavy baryon exotics discussed in [42], and the heavy meson exotics addressed here. This is suggestive of a geometrical realization and generalization of the Savage-Wise symmetry [61] to most heavy exotics. In leading order in the heavy quark limit, the bounded heavy mesons to the tunneling path with fixed Chern- Simons number transmute to fermions. This mechanism is reminiscent of the transmutation of the strange quark spin to the Skyrmion in the kaon-Skyrmion bound state [62]. The binding of the fermions follows by balancing the attraction induced by the Chern Simons term which is dipole-like, and the dual repulsion stemming from the induced U(1) gauge field together with the deviation of the tunneling configuration from self-duality which are 4- dimensional Coulomb-like. The ensuing potential in the molecule is singular. As a result the topologically bound exotics are Efimov states. Our analysis shows that only the open-flavor molecules with x = NQ/Nc < 1.2 are bound in the heavy quark 13 limit. For Nc = 3, the open-flavor exotics QQq\u00afq\u00af and their conjugate Q\u00afQ\u00afqq are bound in a degenerate mul- tiplet IJpi = (00+, 01+) with opposite intrinsic Chern- Simons numbers \u00b1 12 . The open-flavor and non-strange hexaquark states QQQq\u00afq\u00afq\u00af are bound in the heavy quark limit only. The heavier exotics QQQ\u00afQ\u00af are unbound. The compact exotics with hidden-flavor such as QQQ\u00afq\u00af and QQ\u00afqq\u00af are also unbound, but the heavier exotics such as QQ(QQ\u00af)q\u00afq\u00af are bound in the heavy quark limit. The leading holographic correction in the heavy quark mass is found to penalize the binding in ccq\u00afq\u00af more than in bbq\u00afq\u00af. Our analysis suggests a rotational-vibrational tower of multiquark excitations prone to strong decay. Some of the shortcomings of the present approach lie in the use of the triple limits of large Nc, large coupling \u03bb, and large meson mass mH . Although the relaxation of these limits is straightforward in principle, its system- atic implementation is involved in practice. This not withstanding, the present setup is noticeable because of the limited number of parameters it carries. The brane tension \u03ba \u223c \u03bbNc is usually traded for the pion decay constant, and the KK scale for the rho meson mass all in the light meson sector, leaving the treatment of the heavy-light sector parameter free modulo the heavy me- son masses mH . Unlike most of the approaches for heavy exotics [63] (and references therein), the present construction en- forces heavy quark symmetry, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, provides a systematic organizational framework using the QCD parameters Nc, \u03bb,mH , and solves the multi-body problem using topological bound states. The construction can be improved in a number of ways. For instance, by breaking isospin symmetry and including strangeness to account for strange topological exotics, or by adding a tachyon and a tachyon potential to bring the model closer to QCD at short distances, perhaps in the context of improved holographic QCD [64]. These and related issues will be discussed next. VI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Marek Karliner for a discussion.

APPENDIX II: O(3) SYMMETRIC TUNNELING SOLUTION AND ITS FERMIONIC ZERO MODE In this Appendix we suggest yet another tunneling con- figuration with O(3) instead of O(4) symmetry that is also suitable for binding heavy-light mesons which is fully localized in flat R4. This configuration is characterized by a turning point in the holographic direction at z = 0, in agreement with the explosive sphaleron configurations discussed in [54\u201356]. To construct it, we note that the O(4) solutions to the Yang-Mills equations with a turn- ing point at \u03be = 0 relates to the solution with a turning point at z = 0 by the inversion (x+ a)M = 2\u03c12 |y + a|2 (y + a)M (82) with a = (~0, \u03c1), which maps the sphere y2 = \u03c12 onto the upper-half of the x-space as illustrated in Fig. 13. This inversion leaves the line element in R4 unchanged modulo a conformal weight \u03c3(y) |dy|2 = \u03c3(y) |dx|2 = |y + a| 4 4\u03c14 |dx|2 (83) and leaves invariant the 1-form of the gauge field dx\u00b5A\u00b5(x) = dy\u03bdA\u03bd(y) (84) This leads to the transform 14 AaM (x) =\u221a \u03c3(y) ( gMN \u2212 2 (y + a)M (y + a)N (y + a)2 ) AaN (y) (85) with y solving (82). We now proceed to construct the O(3) symmetric zero mode by applying the spatial inversion (82) onto the O(4) symmetric zero mode in (46) through \u03c8\u02dc+(x) = \u03c3\u2020\u00b5 (y + a)\u00b5 1/(y + a)2 \u03c8+(y) (86) More explicitly, we have (r = |~x|) \u03c8\u02dc+(r, z) = 8\u03c16C ((z + \u03c1)2 + r2)2 \u00d7 ((z + \u03c1) + i~\u03c3 \u00b7 ~x) e\u2212 32F (\u03be(y)) \u03c7Q (87) with \u03be(y) = 1 2 ln ( (z \u2212 \u03c1)2 + r2 (z + \u03c1)2 + r2 ) (88) This result is in agreement with the one derived in [56] prior to the analytical continuation to Minkowski space (see their Eq. 22 with a minor correction of the 2 to 32 in their exponent).
