Several species are traditionally used infolk medicine. However, the data made available in recent years have not been organized and compared.Aim of this review: The present study is a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art concerning the traditionaluses, the phytochemistry and the pharmacology of species belonging to the genus Hedyosmum to suggest furtherresearch strategies and to facilitate the exploitation of the therapeutic potential of Hedyosmum species for thetreatment of human disorders.Materials and methods: The present review consists of a systematic overview of scientific literature concerningthe genus Hedyosmum published between 1965 and 2018. Moreover, an older text, dated from 1843, concerningthe traditional uses of H. bonplandianum Kunth has also been considered. Several databases (Francis & Taylor,Google Scholar, PubMed, SciELO, SciFinder, Springer, Wiley, and The Plant List Database) have been used toperform this work.Results: Sixteen species of the genus Hedyosmum have been mentioned as traditional remedies, and a largenumber of ethnomedicinal uses, including for the treatment of pain, depression, migraine, stomach-ache andovary diseases, have been reported. Five species have been used as flavouring agents, tea substitutes or foods.Sesterterpenes, sesquiterpene lactones, monoterpenes, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and neo-lignans have been reported as the most important compounds in these species. Studies concerning their biolo-gical activities have shown that members of the Hedyosmum genus possesses promising biological properties,such as analgesic, antinociceptive, antidepressant, anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic effects. Preliminary studiesconcerning the antibacterial, antioxidant, antiplasmodial, and antifungal activities of these plants as well as theircytotoxic activities against different tumour cell lines have been reported. Some active compounds from theHedyosmum genus have been used as starting points for the innovative and bioinspired development of syntheticmolecules. A critical assessment of these papers has been performed, and some conceptual and methodologicalproblems have been identified regarding the materials and methods and the experimental design used in thesestudies, including a lack of ethnopharmacological research.Conclusions: The present review partially confirms the basis for some of the traditional uses of Hedyosmumspecies (mainly H. brasiliense) through preclinical studies that demonstrated their antinociceptive and neuro-protective effects. Due to promising preliminary results, further studies should be conducted on 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide and podoandin. Moreover, several essential oils (EOs) from this genus have been pre-liminarily investigated, and the cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of H. brasiliense and H. sprucei EOs certainlydeserve further investigation. From the promising findings of the present analysis, we can affirm that this genusdeserves further research from ethnopharmacological and toxicological perspectives.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.111932Received 24 July 2018; Received in revised form 30 April 2019; Accepted 2 May 2019\u2217 Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: vrs@unife.it (S.

IntroductionThe genus Hedyosmum (Chlorantaceae) includes 48 species of smalltrees and shrubs (45 of which are taxonomically characterized and areaccepted as species, and 3 species remain unresolved, meaning that theyare not confirmed as accepted or synonyms) (The Plant List Database).The mentioned species are widespread in low and high mountain rainforests, such as the Andes of South America (Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, andcentral Bolivia) and the mountains of southern Mexico and CentralAmerica (Zhang et al., 2016; Guerrini et al., 2016). In America, He-dyosmum is the most abundant genus in the Chlorantaceae family(Kirchner et al., 2010). H. orientale has also been reported in China andWest Malaysia. A common characteristic of these plants is their strongfragrance; indeed, the genus name finds its origin in the Greek wordshedy- (sweet, nice, fragrant) and osme (smell). The Chlorantaceae familyincludes the genera Sarcandra (2 accepted species), Chloranthus (14accepted species), Hedyosmum (45 accepted species) and Ascarina (12accepted species). A common characteristic of this family, consideredone of the most primitive among Angiospermae, is the presence of se-cretory cells in the stems and leaves (Kirchner et al., 2010; Eklund et al.,2004).The genus is characterized by unisexual diclinous flowers anddentate and opposite leaves as well as petioles sheathed on the base(Todzia, 1988). The aerial parts (mainly the leaves but also bark andfruits) of species belonging to the genus Hedyosmum have been used inethnomedical practices and traditional medicines, by South and CentralAmerican populations. Moreover, scientific studies concerning thechemical compositions of the different parts of these plants, which areall strongly aromatic, and the biological activities of the correspondingderivatives are continuously being published.The aim of this review is to provide a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art concerning the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharma-cology, and toxicology (with particular attention to cytotoxic effects) ofthe extracts and isolated compounds from the genus Hedyosmum.Moreover, the authors will suggest specific further studies that areneeded and potential therapeutic applications of the Hedyosmum spe-cies for the treatment of human diseases.2. Materials and methodsA detailed bibliographic study that included papers published from1965 to 2018 was performed. Of the 112 documents evaluated at thebeginning of this study, 50 references concerning ethnopharmacologydata, phytochemistry and pharmacology studies of the genusHedyosmum have been selected. Another 14 papers have been used tocomplete the present manuscript. Approximately 45 plant species werementioned according to the classification given by the web page www.theplantlist.org, and 28 synonyms were identified. Three species remainunresolved, meaning that they are not yet accepted or confirmed assynonyms, and these assessments were made based on data obtainedfrom theplantlist.org. The name of the genus, the scientific names of allthe species belonging to genus Hedyosmum, and all the synonyms of theabovementioned scientific names were used as keywords. The presentreview was carried out using the following electronic databases: Francis& Taylor, Google Scholar, PubMed, SciELO, SciFinder, Springer, andWiley. The authors have also checked the pharmacopoeias of LatinAmerican and Central American countries, but no data concerning thegenus Hedyosmum were found. Only articles were included, and datafrom symposiums, patents, and congress abstracts were avoided be-cause the data from these sources were not complete enough to allowan effective comparison with the data from full papers. Due to the lackof data concerning traditional uses, some thesis works were initiallyconsidered but were discarded because they were considered unreliablefrom the scientific point of view.3. Traditional usesThe oldest reference found by us during the present review is dated1843, is written in Latin and mentions the traditional use of an H.bomplandianum leaf infusion as a febrifuge and analeptic remedy and aswell as a treatment for hemicranias and pain caused by cold (Martius,1843). The most relevant reference concerning the traditional uses ofthe genus Hedyosmum is the \u201cDictionary of Trees. Volume 2. SouthAmerica. Nomenclature, Taxonomy and Ecology\u201d (Grandtner andChevrette, 2014). Eighteen species of the genus Hedyosmum werementioned as medicinal remedies or food sources (beverages andfruits), and some species were also mentioned as sources of firewoodand of construction materials. The most frequently reported traditionaluses for the Hedyosmum genus are as sedatives, aphrodisiacs, and an-tidepressants and for treating stomach-ache. H. angustifolium has beenused in the preparation of relaxing infusions and as a tea substitute. H.anisodorum, H. arborescens, H. scaberrimus and H. scabrum have mainlybeen reported as digestives, antispasmodics and stomach calmers, whileH. angustifolium, H. bonplandianum and H. racemosum are used tosoothing rheumatic and aching joint pains as well as fever and coldsymptoms. The traditional uses of H. colombianum and H. cumbalenseare mainly associated with human consumption as flavouring agents,and H. sprucei has been used in the treatment of snake bites.The main traditional preparation in folk medicine is a pleasant tea(infusion) from the leaves, and this tea is consumed as a traditionalremedy. Additionally, bark and fruits have been used in traditionalmedicinal preparations or as pleasant foods; in many cases, infusions ofdifferent Hedyosmum species have been described as aromatic bev-erages (Todzia, 1988). Examples of the preparation procedures con-cerning the traditional uses are quite limited. However, infusions ofaerial parts are the most frequently mentioned folk medicineAbbreviationsDPPH, EOs \u03b1,\u03b1-Diphenyl-\u03b2-picrylhydrazyl antioxidant activityassay, Essential OilsGI50, IC50 Cell growth inhibition by 50%, Inhibitory concentration50%VERO Green monkey kidney cellsMCF-7 Human breast cancer cellsTHP-1 Human leukaemia monocyte cell lineA-549 Human lung carcinomaDLD-1 Human colon adenocarcinomaBQ-123 ETA antagonist (endothelin-1 ETA receptor)13HDS 13-Hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolidePDA PodoandinFST Forced swimming testARD Aromadendrane-4\u03b2,10\u03b1-diolHDS 13-Hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolideBHT ButylhydroxytolueneBHA ButylhydroxyanisoleTEAC Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (weak anti-tyr-osinase)A-549 Human lung cancer cell lineHL-60 Human leukaemia cells (tumour cell lines)LD50 Medium lethal concentrationHPTLC High-performance thin-layer chromatographyMCF-7 Human breast cancer cell lineNSCLC Non-small-cell lung cancer cellsNF-\u03baB Nuclear factor \u03baBPS-341 Inhibitor of the proteasomeM.

Reitz (1965) reported a traditional preparation proce-dure involving H. brasiliense, in which 30 g of fresh leaves are infusedin 600 g of white wine, producing a tonic, which has aphrodisiac ef-fects. Unfortunately, as shown in Table 1, no other detailed folk med-icine procedures are reported, and the other reports only general dis-cuss the part of the plant used or the extraction method, e.g., infusion orcooked poultice for external use. Currently, no data are available vali-dating the traditional uses of Hedyosmum genus extracts, and no in-formation has been reported in the pharmacopoeias of Latin Americanor Central American countries, despite being the areas of greatest dis-tribution and use of this genus. Additionally, there are no scientificstudies concerning the synergistic effects of these species with otherspecies commonly used in the countries in which the Hedyosmum genusis widespread. One example is the traditional use of an infusion ofStenostomum lucidum and H. nutans for the treatment of colics. Un-fortunately, no papers support this issue, and no data are availableconcerning the phytochemistry of Stenostomum lucidum. No data havebeen reported on the interactions of the Hedyosmum genus with pre-scribed medications. Finally, there are also very few ethnomedical dataconcerning the traditional preparation procedures or rituals, the part ofthe plant used, and the general traditional knowledge related to theHedyosmum genus.Traditional uses of members of the genus Hedyosmum in differentcountries are listed in Table 1.Species of the genus Hedyosmum have various synonyms, as shownin Table 1, and they are widespread in several countries, as shown inFig. 1. In addition, their common names are characteristic of the regionsin which they are found. In Bolivia, H. angustifolium (Ruiz & Pav\u00f3n) iscalled \u201cMatico menta\u201d, and in Brazil, H. Brasiliense is known as \u201ccidr\u00e3o\",\u201ccidreira\u201d and \u201cerva-de-bugre\" among other names. In Colombia, the H.translucidum Cuatrec is known as \u201cGranizo\u201d or \u201cGranicillo\u201d because ofthe shape of its fruits. In Ecuador, H. scabrum is known as \u201cGuayusa decerro\u201d, \u201cTarqui\u201d or \u201cGraniso\u201d (De la Torre et al., 2008), and H. sprucei isknown as \u201csacha lim\u00f3n panga\u201d, \" sacha lim\u00f3n caspa,\u201d or \" hoja demonte\u201d (Guerrini et al., 2016).4. PhytochemistryThe main chemical constituents of the Hedyosmum genus are listedin Table 2, and the chemical constituents of the essential oils (EOs) ofHedyosmum species are summarized in Table 3. The Hedyosmum genusoffers several interesting and unique compounds, such as hedyosuminsA, B, C, D, and E and hedyorienoids A and B. As reported by Trentinet al. (1999), 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide has been isolatedfrom H. brasiliense and other plant species. Sesquiterpenes and ses-terterpenes are the main focus of several studies concerning the biolo-gical activities of the Hedyosmum genus. Moreover, other interestingcompounds, such as rosmarinic acid, have been reported to explain thebiological activities of the Hedyosmum genus. Detailed information isprovided in Section 5.4.1. Sesquiterpenes and sesterterpenesSesterterpenes are the most commonly reported components in theHedyosmum genus, and H. brasiliense is the most frequently mentionedspecies. The presence of seven sesquiterpenes, namely, guaianolidepodoandin, 1,2-epoxy-10a-hydroxy-podoandin, 1-hydroxy-10,15-me-thylenepodoandin, elemenolide 15-acetoxy-isogermafurenolide, 15-hydroxy-isogermafurenolide, lindenanolide 8\u03b1/\u03b2,9\u03b1 hydroxyl-onoser-iolide and onoseriolide, in the species H. brasiliense was reported byAmoah et al. (2013). Onoseriolide was previously isolated from H.angustifolium bark by Acebey et al. (2010) together with other sesqui-terpenes, such as oxyonoseriolide, hedyosmone, chloranthalactone Aand spathulenol. Additionally, Su et al. (2008) reported the presence ofspathulenol and other sesquiterpenes, such as 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehy-droshizukanolide and aromadendrane-4\u03b2,10\u03b2-diol, in the ethanolicextract of the aerial parts of H. orientale. The sesquiterpene alcoholaromadendrane-4\u03b2,10\u03b1-diol was obtained from the leaves of H. brasi-liense by Amoah et al. (2013a and 2015b). The mentioned compoundwas previously separated from other plant species, such as Xylopiabrasiliensis (Moreira et al., 2003).Amoah et al.

The sesquiterpene lactone13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide was also identified in a hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from stems and leaves of H. brasiliense(Trentin et al., 1999; Calixto et al., 2001). Other sesquiterpene lactones,such as 7,10-epoxy-hedyosminolide and 7\u03b1,10\u03b1-epoxy-1\u03b1(H),5\u03b1(H)-guaia-3,11(13)-dien-8\u03b1,12-olide, were isolated from leaves of H. ar-borescens in Guadeloupe, French West Indies (Bercion et al., 2006). Suet al. (2008) isolated five guaiane-type sesquiterpenoids, hedyosuminsA, B, C, D and E, for the first time from an ethanolic extract of the aerialparts of H. orientale. Additionally, two sesquiterpenoids, 10\u03b1R-hydroxy-1,5\u03b1RH-guaia-3,7(11)-dien-8\u03b1R,12-olide and 9\u03b1R-hydroxyasterolide,Fig. 1.

(2000) from a santonin.Moreover, two sesquiterpenoid dimers, hedyorienoids A and B, wererecently reported by Fan et al. (2018) and Tolardo et al. (2010), re-spectively. Finally, two sesterterpenes, bolivianine and isobolivianine,were isolated from an ethyl acetate extract of H. angustifolium (Acebeyet al., 2010, 2007). These molecules have been widely investigated inthe development of new techniques for organic synthesis.4.2. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivativesAs reported by Amoah et al. (2015), rosmarinic acid and isorinicacid (caffeoyl-4\u2032-hydroxy-phenyllactic acid) have been isolated fromthe fresh leaves of H. brasiliense by hot infusion; isorinic acid is con-sidered an intermediate in the biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid.Rosmarinic acid is known to possess various biological activities, suchas anticancer, neuroactive, and antioxidant activities (Amoah et al.,2015). Rosmarinic acid has recently been reported to be a hepatopro-tective compound (Evidente et al., 2015) and as an effective prophy-lactic and remedy for neuropathic pain (Rahbardar et al., 2018).Moreover, another recent study performed by Cornejo et al. (2017) onrosmarinic acid showed a promising result concerning its ability toprevent fibrillization linked to Alzheimer's disease. A previous studyfrom the same authors also mentioned the presence of another hydro-xycinnamic acid derivative, ethyl caffeate (Amoah et al., 2013).4.3.

Journal of Ethnopharmacology 244 (2019) 11193213terms of both application and characterization. An early report byC\u00e1rdenas et al. (1993) described the isolation of two flavonoid glyco-sides, kaempferol 3-O-[\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1\u21926)-\u03b2-D-glucopyrano-side] and kaempferol 3-O-[\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside], from the n-butanolextracts of the leaves of H. bonplandianum. These findings are consistentwith flavonoids being present in the folk medicines use as analgesics inColombia. Rainer (2013) mentioned the antibiotic activity of a folkmedicine involving H. racemosum, and the activity was probably due tothe presence of flavonoids. Recently, Amoah et al. (2015) isolatedkaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide from H. brasiliense. The presence ofthis compound correlates well with the reported traditional uses(Table 1). Notably, kaempferol, a flavonoid, is a very important in-gredient in functional foods and has a wide range of therapeutic ap-plications, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer ap-plications. Its action involves several intracellular and extracellulartargets that regulate apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion or metastasis, an-giogenesis, and inflammation. Further research to confirm its presencein other Hedyosmum species is encouraged.4.4. NeolignansNeolignans have attracted the attention of researchers due to theactivity of the most well-known members of this class, magnolol andhonokiol, which are the main substances responsible for the beneficialproperties of magnolia bark extract. This very interesting class of mo-lecules is still underexplored despite the initial interest and subsequentdiscovery of their potent antiplatelet activity (Shen, 1991). The neo-lignans (7S, 8R)-5-methoxydihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside and (7S, 8R)-urolignoside were isolated from the freshleaves H. brasiliense by Amoah et al. (2015). This is the first report ofthese compounds in the genus Hedyosmum, although they were pre-viously found in other Chloranthaceae species, such as Chloranthus ja-ponicus (Kuang et al., 2009) and Sarcandra glabra (Wu et al., 2012).Reports on neolignans in Hedyosmum are very rare, making them aninteresting topic for further investigations.4.5. Other compoundsSeveral other compounds have been detected in the n-hexane andEtOAc fractions of the hydro-alcoholic double-distillate of H. brasiliense(Amoah et al., 2013). The authors identified the phenolic aldehydesvanillin, protocatechuic aldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, andthe latter is a precursor in the biosynthesis of vanillin, which is animportant compound. Coumarin scopoletin was also detected in thisspecies.4.6. Essential oils from the Hedyosmum genusThe Hedyosmum genus is also a source of essential oils (EOs). Severalstudies have been performed on different species and different parts ofthe plants, such as aerial parts, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Terpenes,including mainly sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenes, are the majorconstituents of EOs obtained by this genus. Table 4 summarizes themain compounds of Hedyosmum EOs. A large amount of dataconcerning EOs from the Hedyosmum genus have been reported over aconsiderable number of studies (Guerrini et al., 2016; Kirchner et al.,2010; Murakami et al., 2017; Correa-Royero et al., 2010). Two bicyclicmonoterpenes, \u03b2-pinene and sabinene, are the most common con-stituents of Hedyosmum EOs and have been detected in 5 differentspecies, followed by the sesquiterpene germacrene D (4 species), theisoprenoid pinocarvone and the cyclic monoterpene \u03b1-phellandrene(each in 3 species). \u03b2-Pinene has been reported to show promisingantifungal activity against Candida albicans and a synergistic bacter-icidal effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in com-bination with ciprofloxacin (Rivas da Silva et al., 2012). A study per-formed by Zhang et al. (2015) showed that \u03b2-pinene and paclitaxelhave a synergistic effect against non-small-cell lung cancer cells(NSCLC). \u03b2-Pinene has also been reported as a component of severalEOs; recent studies focused on Chinese traditional medicines havementioned its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, its effective-ness for the control of Rhodnius nasutus (the vector of Chagas disease)(de Souza et al., 2018), and its potential as pest control agent againstTribolium castaneum (Pajaro-Castro et al., 2017). Additionally, sabinene,germacrene D and the other main components of Hedyosmum EOs havebeen extensively reported in several other studies concerning EOs.4.7. Other related topics regarding the phytochemistry of the HedyosmumgenusOne of the principal findings of the reported studies is the activenatural products, especially bolivianine, isobolivianine and onoser-iolide, obtained from species belonging to the Hedyosmum genus. Theyhave been used as starting points for innovative research towardbioinspired synthetic procedures (Yuan et al., 2013; Du et al., 2014;Ardkhean et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016; Hugelshoferand Magauer, 2017; Li et al., 2017). Bioinspired approaches play a keyrole in discovery and constantly provide innovative avenues forstudying new active compounds. It should be noted that sesterterpenesare unusual compounds that are often present in various marine or-ganisms, especially sponges, but are also obtained from bacteria andplants. Sesterterpenes have been studied for their peculiar chemicalstructures and for their anticancer and cytotoxic activities(Kaweetripob, 2018; Evidente et al., 2015; Wang, 2012; Ebada, 2010).5. Pharmacological effectsEthnomedical practices and traditional uses of plants are often asource of inspiration and useful starting points for studies regardingvarious types of biological activities. This is the case for the Hedyosmumgenus, as the related ethnomedical reports have been used as a guide formany biological investigations. In this section, several different biolo-gical activities related to the EOs, various extracts and isolated com-pounds belonging to various Hedyosmum species are listed and brieflydescribed. Finally, although some papers reported data concerningchemical antioxidant assays (e.g., DPPH assay and \u03b2-carotene/linoleicacid bioassay), these results are not discussed herein because this in-formation is not considered pharmacologically relevant.

Radice, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 244 (2019) 11193215Hedyosmum genus, but this type of test has been called into question fortheir inadequate transferability to clinical applications. There is little orno evidence that in vitro antioxidant activities can be directly correlatedwith human studies (Mimica-Duki\u0107 et al., 2016; HerbalEGram, 2018).The pharmacological effects of members of this genus are sum-marized in Tables 4 and 5.5.1. Neuroprotective, anxiolytic, antidepressant and sedative effectsCompounds isolated from H. brasiliense have been investigated invivo as neuroprotective agents. Specifically, ARD (aromadendrane-4\u03b2,10\u03b1-diol), 13HDS (13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide) and PDA(podoandin) significantly enhanced the A\u03b21-42 peptide-inducedmemory impairment in the passive avoidance test, without increasedadverse effects on locomotor activities (Amoah et al., 2015a). As re-ported by Tolardo et al. (2010), the ethanolic extract of H. brasilienseand a compound isolated from this extract, podoandin, were studied ina preliminary neuropharmacological screening and displayed anxio-lytic, antidepressant, sedative and hypnotic activities that support theethnobotanical information. A study performed by Gon\u00e7alves et al.(2012) demonstrated that the crude extract of H. brasiliense and PDAcan induce an antidepressant-like effect in mice (forced swimming test -FST). In the same study, to better understand the biological mechanismof the antidepressant-like activity, the mice were pretreated with se-lective receptor antagonists to investigate the possible involvement ofdopaminergic, GABAergic, noradrenergic, opioid, oxidonitrergic andserotonergic systems. The results suggest that the mechanism involvesthe dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems but not theGABAergic, oxidonitrergic and opioid systems.5.2. Analgesic and antinociceptive effectC\u00e1rdenas et al. (1993) studied the n-butanol extract of H. bon-plandianum and two flavonoid glycosides, kaempferol 3-O-[\u03b1-L-rham-nopyranosyl(1\u2192 6)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside] and kaempferol 3-O-[\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside], extracted from the leaves. A preliminary in vivo studyon mice showed that these materials exhibited significant analgesicactivities, which is consistent with ethnobotanical reports from Co-lombian folk medicine practices. A previous test performed by Di Stasiet al. (1988) on the same species showed that the aqueous ethanol(50:50, v/v) extract had in vivo analgesic activity (writhing test); in thistest, the extract was concentrated to allow the administration of 1 g/kgdoses in mice.In a study regarding the 4:1 ethanol-water extract of H. brasiliensestems and leaves, Trentin et al. (1999) demonstrated for the first time adose-related antinociceptive effect in different types of chemical pain inmice at concentrations from 12.7 to 69mg/kg. Additionally, the ses-quiterpene lactone 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide (13HDS),isolated from the same species, showed antinociceptive activity. Afurther work by Martini et al. (2007) described the antinociceptive ef-fects of several compounds from plants reported as useful in Brazilianfolk medicine. The sesquiterpene 13HDS, isolated from the leaves andstems of H. brasiliense, was able (812 \u03bcM) to inhibit [3H] glutamatebinding and [3H] glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles in vitro.5.3. Anti-erectile dysfunction effectLeitolis et al. (2016) investigated the relaxant effects of two com-pounds, 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide (podoandin) and 15-acetoxy-isogermafurenolide (elemanolide), isolated from H. brasilienseand the effects of the hexane fraction of the ethanolic extract of theleaves (15 days) on endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rataortic rings and strips of corpus cavernosum. The results of this studysupport the aphrodisiac effects of H. brasiliense extracts and its com-ponents (ranging from 49.5 to 65.9% at 100 \u03bcM) reported in ethnobo-tanical studies (Reitz et al., 1965).

The authors suggested thatfurther studies involving cardiovascular diseases are needed despite theabsence of ethnobotanical information.5.4. Anticancer effectAcebey et al. (2010) reported the cytotoxic effects of five sesqui-terpenes, oxyonoseriolide, hedyosmone, onoseriolide, chlor-anthalactone A and spathulenol, isolated from the ethyl acetate extractsof the bark of H. angustifolium. A cytotoxic assay was performed in vitroon human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and the human leukaemiamonocyte cell line THP-1. Oxyonoseriolide displayed strong cytotoxi-city against VERO cells but moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 andTHP-1 cells (IC50 values 0.2 \u03bcM, 23.8 \u03bcM and 4.2 \u03bcM, respectively). Asreported by Sylvestre et al. (2007), the cytotoxic activity of the EOobtained from the leaves of H. arborescens was tested against humanlung carcinoma (A-549) and human colon adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) celllines. The oil showed moderate anticancer activity against both celllines, with GI50 values (concentration of the EO that inhibited cellgrowth by 50%) of 178 \u00b1 9 \u03bcg/mL for DLD-1 and 158 \u00b1 7 \u03bcg/mL forA-549.The cytotoxic activities of ten guaiane-type sesquiterpenoids iso-lated from H. orientale were investigated by Su et al. (2008). All com-pounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against human lungadenocarcinoma (A-549) and human leukaemia (HL-60) tumour celllines. Only one of the above-mentioned molecules, 9\u03b1-hydro-xyasterolide, exhibited moderate activities against both the A-549 andHL-60 cell lines (IC50 values of 3.1 \u03bcM and 8.8 \u03bcM, respectively). Fanet al. (2018) reported for the first time the presence of two sesqui-terpenoid dimers, hedyorienoids A and B, and the latter showed pro-mising NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity. Additionally, H. sprucei EO showedremarkable cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 (IC50 values of32.76 \u00b1 4.92 ??g/mL and 33.64 \u00b1 0.43 ??g/mL at 48 h and 72 h,respectively) and A549 (IC50 values of 44.05 \u00b1 2.35 ??g/mL and43.55 \u00b1 2.80 ??g/mL at 48 h and 72 h, respectively) cell lines(Guerrini et al., 2016).5.5. Antibacterial and anti-plasmodial effectsThe in vitro inhibitory effects of the EO of H. brasiliense against sixbacterial species (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus sapro-phyticus) and six fungal species (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum andTrichophyton mentagrophytes) were investigated. The oil showed low ac-tivities against Gram-negative strains but expressed good antibacterialactivities (MIC values from 0.125 to 2.5% v/v) against Gram-positivebacteria and human opportunistic pathogenic fungi and dermatophytes(Kirchner et al., 2010). Another study regarding sesquiterpenoids ob-tained from H. brasiliense was carried out by Amoah et al. (2013). Thiswork started with the isolation of seven compounds (1,2-epoxy-10\u03b1-hy-droxy-podoandin, 1-hydroxy-10,15-methylenepodoandin, 15-acetoxy-isogermafurenolide, 8\u03b1/\u03b2,9\u03b1-hydroxy-onoseriolide, podoandin, onoser-iolide, and 15-hydroxy-isogermafurenolide), which were tested againstisoniazid-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures. None of thesesesquiterpene lactones showed anti-mycobacterial activities at the studiedconcentrations (1\u201330 \u03bcM).A study of the infusions obtained from the fresh leaves of the femaleand male plants of H. brasiliense (Amoah et al., 2015a) focused on theantimicrobial activities of the infusion and its main components (ros-marinic acid, isorinic acid, (7S,8R)-5-methoxydihydrodehy-drodiconiferyl alcohol-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, (7S,8R)-urolignoside,podoandin, onoseriolide, 1-\u03b1-acetoxyeudesma-3,7(11)\u2013dien\u20138,12\u2013o-lide, 15-hydroxy-isogerma-furenolide, and kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucur-onide) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No significant activities wereobserved at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1.56 \u03bcg/mL. Murakamiet al. (2017) evaluated the chemical composition as well as the anti-fungal and the antioxidant activities of H. brasiliense EOs. Four oils wereobtained by hydrodistillation from the leaves and flowers of both maleand female trees. The EO from female flowers showed consistent anti-fungal activities against Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penz and Cla-dosporium cladosporioides. The other EOs showed weaker activities. In2010, Acebey et al. studied the anti-leishmanial activities, the cytotoxiceffects and the antiplasmodial activities of five sesquiterpenes, oxyo-noseriolide, hedyosmone, onoseriolide, chloranthalactone A and spa-thulenol, isolated from the ethyl acetate extracts of the bark of H. an-gustifolium. Onoseriolide was the main active compound against twoaxenically cultured amastigotes, Leishmania amazonensis(IC50= 19.8 \u03bcM) and Leishmania infantum (IC50= 20.9 \u03bcM). In-tramacrophagic amastigotes were also tested, and the assay showedIC50 values between 24.3 \u03bcM and 29.1 \u03bcM. Onoseriolide also exhibitedmoderate antiplasmodial activity and weak cytotoxicity.5.6. Other biological effectsThe ethanolic extract of the leaves of H. bonplandianum has beeninvestigated by radioligand-binding techniques to determine its in-hibition of [3H] BQ-123 binding (endothelin-1 ETA receptor). Theassay represents a preclinical model for the treatment of cardiovascular,mental, and feeding disorders as well as hypertension. In this in vitromodel, bioactive compounds bind to G-protein-coupled receptor sub-types, which seem to be involved in the above-mentioned disorders. Ina preliminary screening, the extract showed very high inhibitory ac-tivity, suggesting that is could open new research opportunities in thefield of endothelin receptor antagonists. Correa-Royero et al. (2010)evaluated the antifungal activities and cytotoxic effects of 32 EOs onVERO cells. From this in vitro study, according to the criteria for cyto-toxic activity set by the American National Cancer Institute (USA) forcrude extracts (IC50 < 30 \u03bcg/mL), the EOs of Hedyosmum spp. (sca-berrium and racemosum) were cytotoxic. These data are very importantfor identifying antifungal compounds with low toxicity profiles. He-dyorienoid B, a sesquiterpenoid dimer obtained from H. orientale, wastested to determine its ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB, a key factor involved inanti-inflammatory processes, cell survival, apoptosis, and metabolicdiseases. Compound 12 showed promising NF-\u03baB inhibitory activitywith an IC50 value of 5.34 \u00b1 2.21 \u03bcM (Fan et al., 2018).5.7. Critical assessments of the papers reviewed and final discussionThe papers reviewed herein have been critically assessed, and someconceptual and methodological problems have been identified, espe-cially regarding their materials and methods and the experimental de-signs. The assessments were based on the recent guidelines for manu-script submission in the peer-reviewed pharmacological literature(Editorial/Biochemical Pharmacology, 2015; Mullane and Williams,2015). For instance, none of the reviewed studies reported whether theinvestigator responsible for data analysis was blind to which samples oranimals represented the control and treatment groups. None of the invitro studies mentioned the passage number and population doublingtime (PDL) of the cell lines used. Concerning the tests on animalmodels, only 3 reviewed papers mentioned complete data regardingcompliance with regulations on the ethical treatment of animals, in-cluding the institutional committee or organization that approved thedesign of the experiments. Only one article reported data concerningthe method of anaesthesia. Data on sex, weight, age and group sizewere adequately reported in 2 papers. Concerning the main relevantpharmacological data and the quantified results of concentration- anddose-response-related experiments (such as IC50 and/or EC50 values, thedose range tested, the minimal active concentration, in vitro or in vivostudies, positive and negative controls, experiment duration, and typeof extract), a detailed description of the available data is presented inTables 4 and 5 The threshold for statistical significance (P value) wasM. Radice, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 244 (2019) 11193217clearly indicated, and data were reported as the mean \u00b1 standarddeviation (SD) of three or more independent experimental replications.In addition to the evaluation based on the guidelines for manuscriptsubmission in the peer-reviewed pharmacological literature, all thereview papers have been further analysed concerning the followingcriteria to assess their quality and validity. (a) Is the study linked to thedescribed local and traditional uses? (b) Are the local and traditionaluses adequately described in peer review references? (c) Is botanicalidentification by experts is mentioned? (d) Is the study based on iso-lated compounds? Only 7 of the papers reviewed completely describedthe relationship between the study and the local and traditional uses orknowledge as well as presenting a solid methodology concerning bo-tanical identification. In all the reviewed papers, traditional uses andethnomedical information are poorly described or only partially re-ported. Moreover, especially in the older studies and in the evaluationsof EOs, the pharmacological studies were performed only on crudeextracts or fractions. Some gaps remain in the above-mentioned datarelated to conceptual and methodological approaches, especially re-garding the material and methods sections of the reviewed papers.Further investigations on isolated compounds should be performed.Finally, in order to summarize our results, the Hedyosmum genusappears to be an interesting platform for research into the large-scaleuse of plant species moving from ethnomedical traditions to possibleapplications in modern health products. Although many plants of thegenus Hedyosmum have been reported to have important traditionaluses, they are not mentioned in the pharmacopoeia of these countries,and studies are quite limited or incomplete. The most salient findingsare studies on H. brasiliense, which is the most thoroughly investigatedand mentioned plant of the genus, and some traditional uses reportedfor this species have been partially confirmed by in vitro and in vivostudies, even if solid clinical evidence remains far off. However, animportant issue is that the traditional uses of preparations derived fromHedyosmum plants do not show relevant toxicological properties, sup-porting the fact that they can be considered generally recognized assafe; similar to other medicinal plants currently used in modern healthproducts. In particular, preliminary studies on H. orientale and H. spruceiproduced promising results, and notably numerous investigations(Martini et al. (2007); Tolardo et al. (2010); Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2012);Leitolis et al. (2016)) into their antidepressant activities and effects onerectile dysfunction suggest that they deserve further study. This fra-mework highlights the importance of matching ethnobotanical andpharmacological studies to exploit the bioactivities related to humandiseases for further modern applications. Traditional uses remain thelargest clinical study ever conducted on medical plants, at least con-cerning their safety, and thus they constitute a good basis for the se-lection of novel active molecules for optimization with modern drugdevelopment approaches.Although the traditional uses of 21 Hedyosmum species have beendescribed, only 16 species (H. angustifolium, H. anisodorum, H. arbor-escens, H. bonplandianum, H. brasiliense, H. crenatum, H. cuatrecazanum,H. cumbalense, H. goudotianum, H. luteynii, H. maximum, H. nutans, H.racemosum, H. scabrum, H. sprucei, and H. uniflorum) of the genusHedyosmum have been mentioned as traditional remedies, and a largenumber of ethnomedicinal uses have been reported, including for thetreatment of pain, depression, migraine, stomach-ache and ovary dis-eases. Five species (H. colombianum, H. mexicanum, H. purpurascens, H.scaberrimum, and H. translucidum) have been reported as flavouringagents, as tea substitutes, infusions or foods. The preliminary findingsdescribed by Martini et al. (2007) allow the presumption of interactionsbetween 13HDS (16) and other drugs that act on the glutamatergicsystem. Actually, as reported in the present review, the link betweenethnobotanical and pharmacological studies passing through phy-tochemistry of Hedyosmum species seems to be at the beginning of thestory, resulting in promising and interesting implications.With specific reference to phytochemical evidence and applications,Hedyosmum species containing bolivianine, isobolivianine andonoseriolide are emerging as important starting points for developingbioinspired synthetic procedures and products. Moreover, the speciesH. brasiliense that contain 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide androsmarinic acid, both known to exert relaxant, antinociception, andneuroprotective effects through in vitro and in vivo assays, may haveapplications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Flavonoids,kaempferol derivatives and neolignans, in particular, are very im-portant natural molecules with several health effects and applications,and the corresponding extracts from Hedyosmum genus seem to beunderinvestigated.The chemical constituents of the EOs from 11 species of theHedyosmum genus have been investigated, but preliminary studies re-garding biological activities have been reported for only 3 species andadditional research is needed. In particular, the antibacterial bioauto-graphy-guided approach represents an interesting tool to rapidly andeasily connect the phytochemistry and biological activities of phyto-complexes, as shown by Guerrini et al. (2016). Again, the EO of H.brasilense is the most investigated, but interesting preliminary resultshave been reported for the EO of H. sprucei, especially concerning itscytotoxic activity, which highlights the need for further in-depth in-vestigations.Based on the research collected in the present review, most of thepharmacological effects of Hedyosmum spp. compounds can be attrib-uted to sesquiterpenes, sesterterpenes, and hydroxycinnamic acid. Thefindings reported in the present review mainly focus on the chemicalcharacterization of pure compounds or EOs with different approachesand different levels of detail; moreover, biological analyses ofHedyosmum spp. derivatives are \u201climited\u201d to in vitro and in vivo assays,and the data often do not adequately match the phytochemical in-vestigations of the species. These findings encourage in-depth in-vestigations focused on the Hedyosmum genus, as more studies re-porting various useful biological activities and chemical compositionsare undoubtedly of great interest in the medicinal chemistry andmedical fields. Most of these studies were inspired by traditional eth-nomedical practices carried out mainly by South and Central Americanpopulations.6. ConclusionSeveral research groups have investigated the Hedyosmum genus,and some promising preliminary findings have been reported. Despitethis, there has not yet been sufficient follow-up to fully clarify thesediscoveries.In order to expand our understanding and promote research onHedyosmum species, the following approaches should be of interest tothe research community: (1) recollect and systematize the traditionalknowledge concerning Hedyosmum species for focused ethnopharma-cological research; (2) design new studies concerning the semisynthesisor the partial chemical synthesis for the development of new bioactivechemical entities based on the bioactive compounds mentioned inTables 5 and 13-hydroxy-8,9-dehydroshizukanolide (molecule 16) andpodoandin (molecule 11) should perhaps be prioritized as they havebeen investigated more than the other molecules; (3) further investigatethe use of H. brasiliense extracts, fractions or pure compounds as po-tential treatments of Alzheimer's disease; (4) screen the bioactivities ofpure compounds from the EOs of the Hedyosmum genus, with thebioautography-guided approach as a privileged method; (5) performtoxicological evaluations (acute and long-term toxicity studies) giventhe lack of empirical and scientific data while considering the tradi-tional knowledge derived from traditional long-term use; (6) more in-vestigations are needed to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways, thepharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms of actionand the toxicities of compounds present in Hedyosmum spp.Due to the importance of developing new bioactive compounds, thisreview provides a complete and up-to-date overview of traditional usesand scientific studies regarding the Hedyosmum genus and represents aM.
