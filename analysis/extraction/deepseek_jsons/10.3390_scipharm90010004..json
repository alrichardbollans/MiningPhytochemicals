As a result, they have been the subject of numerous morphological, anatomical, and evo-lutionary studies. However, few studies have focused on their phytochemical profile and theirpotential pharmacological activities. The genus Elegia L. is the second largest of this family compris-ing 52 species, which are mainly used as materials for thatching. Limited studies on the chemicalconstituents of Elegia species and their importance as medicinal plants have been undertaken. Thisreview provides constructive and extensive information about the botanical characterization, distribu-tion, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the genus Elegia. A comprehensive searchof previously published literature was performed for studies on this genus, using databases withdifferent key search words. This survey documented 52 Elegia species summarizing their previoustaxonomic classification. In addition, 14 species were found to be studied for their phytochemicalprofile, revealing 14 chemical compounds. Concerning their biological activities, only one species(E. tectorum (L.f.) Moline and H.P.Linder) is reported for its anti-wrinkle activity. Moreover, twospecies are locally used for thatching and as materials for brooms. The present review highlights theElegia genus as an important source of bioactive phytochemicals with flavonol glycosides being themain metabolites and reveals the uncharted territory of this genus for new research studies.Keywords: genus Elegia; Restionaceae; restios; flora of South Africa; flavonoids; proanthocyanidins;anti-wrinkle activity1. IntroductionRestionaceae is an ancient family, related to grasses and sedges, which includes60 genera and over 500 species [1\u20133]. It is distributed throughout the southern hemispherewith the majority of its populations occurring in Africa (approximately 360 species) and inAustralia (approximately 150 species) [1,3]. Plants of this family are known as restios andpossess a dominant ecological role in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Fynbos isthe main vegetation of this biodiversity hotspot and restios are considered its characteristiccomponent [1,4].In general, the taxonomy of this family is challenging and is constantly modifieddue to new genetic data [5]. The African species belong to Restionoidae Mast. subfamily,which consists of approximately 16 genera and 360 species. The Restionoidae subfamilyis further divided into 2 tribes, Restioneae Bartl. and Willdenowieae Masters [1,6]. TheWilldenowieae tribe contains 8 genera, while the rest belong to the Restioneae tribe. Withinthe Restioneae tribe, there are several groups, one of which is the Elegia group includingtwo genera, Elegia L. and Askidiosperma Steud. [1]. The name Elegia has Greek origin andderives from the ancient Greek word \u201celegeia\u201d which means ode and the root word \u201celegos\u201dSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4. https://doi.org/10.3390/scipharm90010004 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/scipharmSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4 2 of 11which translates as lament, mourning or mourning song accompanied by a flute. The wordwas later used by Plinius in the Latinized form to describe a kind of reed [5].The Restionaceae family shows an intriguing ecological dominance in South Africa [1].Consequently, plants of this well-known family have been the subject of numerous mor-phological, anatomical and evolutionary studies [4,6]. However, the absence of reports onpotential pharmacological activities and the lack of up-to-date scientific studies of the phy-tochemistry are enthralling facts that led us to thoroughly study the restios and especiallythe genus Elegia. Recently, E. tectorum revealed promising anti-wrinkle activity. Thus, theaim of this review was to provide constructive and extensive information about the botaniccharacterization, distribution, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of thegenus Elegia with the hope of further exploration of the scientific potential of these plants.2. Materials and MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted on scientific databases includingGoogle Scholar, PubMed and Reaxys. The keywords \u201cElegia\u201d, \u201cRestionaceae\u201d, \u201cRestios\u201d,\u201cElegia compounds\u201d, \u201cElegia phytochemicals\u201d, \u201cElegia pharmacological\u201d and \u201cElegia tradi-tional uses\u201d were used for data collection. The number of searches/hits for each keywordis presented in Table 1. The criteria for the selection of the used articles were studies on thetraditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of this genus. Searcheswere performed for other potential studies by manual screening references in the usedresearch articles. Moreover, books with rigorous quality of taxonomic information andethnobotany were selected for the review. The latest date for searching the literature was15 October 2021. The time range of data collection was from 1969 to 2021. The taxonomy ofthe African Restionaceae available in IntKey format as a free download from the websiteof the University of Zurich was used to validate the scientific names, provide informa-tion about the distribution, botanical characterization and traditional uses of the Africanspecies [7]. The Elegia species with their botanical synonyms (previous botanical names)are displayed in Table 2, the specialized natural products reported in the genus Elegia arecategorized by species in Table 3 and the chemical structures of the identified compoundsare illustrated in Table 4.Table 1.

Botanical Characterization and DistributionThe plants of the Restionaceae family are found all over the southern hemisphere withapproximately 360 species in Africa, 150 in Australia, 4 in New Zealand, 1 in SouthwestAsia and 1 in South America. All the species of the genus Elegia are endemic to the Westernand Eastern Cape Province of South Africa [1,3]. The genus Elegia L. is the second largestof the family with 52 species (Table 2) [5,7].Plants of the Restionaceae family are evergreen, grass-like plants, caespitose, rhi-zomatous or stoloniferous, growing to a maximum height of 3.5 m (depending on thespecies) [1,3]. Species belonging to the Elegia L. are either caespitose or rhizomatous [3].The stems of the restios are called culms and they are the only green part of the plant andare, therefore, considered as the main photosynthetic organ [1,3]. The culms of the Elegiaspecies could be simple or branched. The leaves of the restios are reduced to sheaths inSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4 3 of 11adult plants, they can also be persistent, but usually the plants lose these sheaths. Maleand female inflorescences are usually similar, much branched with numerous small, oftendark-coloured spikelets or solitary flowers [1,3]. Spikelets consist of flowers and largebracts (a modified leaf) that are called spathes. Spathes are prominent and often obscurethe flowers [1]. Restios\u2019 flowers have three petals and three sepals forming a perianth ofsix tepals whose color, shape, size and texture vary for each species [1]. Each flower isminute (<10 mm long) and is situated on a central axis above a bract. The fruit can be eithera 1\u20133 locular capsule or a 1-locular nut [1,3]. The seeds have an elliptical shape and arebetween 1\u20132 mm long [1].The entire family is wind-pollinated and all genera apart from Coleocarya S.T. Blakeand Lepyrodia R. Br. are dioecious. The enlarged bracts and spathes of the Elegia genusappear to work as air scoops, that guide the wind to pass through the styles. Alternatively,they are able to cause local eddies that help the pollen drop down onto the styles. Thesemechanisms have a high efficacy, since very little pollen of other species has been detectedon the styles of the Elegia species [1].Table 2.

Traditional UsesThe traditional use of herbs is an integral part of the culture and religious prac-tices/rituals of African people. It is estimated that over 80% of the South African popula-tion has consulted local therapists who employ traditional methods and treatments, usingvarious parts of native plants at least once in their lives [8]. To date, numerous culturalcommunities of the region depend on traditional medicine, called \u201cmuthi\u201d, instead of themodern western medicine [9]. South Africa has a multitude of tribes, each of which uses itsown remedies [8,10]. It is estimated that more than 3400 medicinal species exist in southernAfrica of which 2062 taxa have been identified as being used and/or sold in this region [9].These taxa belong to 171 families with the 5 most popular medicinal plant families beingthe Asteraceae (2236 species; 257 medicinal species), Fabaceae (1638 species; 159 medicinalspecies), Apocynaceae (689 species; 104 medicinal species), Asphodelaceae (558 species;83 medicinal species) and Lamiaceae (264 species; 68 medicinal species) [9]. Despite thelarge contribution of restios to the local flora (over 360 spp. in Africa), Williams et al. (2013)reported that only one species is documented as a medicinal plant, but its common orbotanical name was not mentioned [9]. However, some species of the family have beenrecorded in ethnobotany, still they are all only used as materials for the manufacture oftools such as brushes and dusters [10]. Among them, two Elegia species (E. equisetacea andE. tectorum) are used for thatching and as materials for brooms [1,10].Plants of Restionaceae family are widely used by the local populations with their mainpurpose being as a building material for roof thatching [1,3]. Several of them were used asbuilding materials in many areas of South Africa long before the first European coloniesSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4 6 of 11arrived. These constructions can still be seen in locations where traditional \u201creed\u201d housescontinue to be built and maintained in a similar way. The culms in particular are usedfor the construction of various parts of the houses such as roofs and walls [1]. During theDutch East India Company\u2019s presence in the Western Cape, E. tectorum (L.f.) Moline andH.P. Linder was one of the most used species for thatching [1,5]. Due to its strong presencein the flora of the surrounding area, it is was probably the main plant employed to build theroofs of what is now modern Cape Town several centuries ago [7]. Nowadays, thatching isprepared mostly from Thamnochortus insignis Mast. Apart from thatching, some species arelocally used as materials for brooms. In current years, there is an increasing use of restiosfor ornamental purposes since they are ideal for areas with water shortages [1].5. PhytochemistryAlthough the Restionaceae family has been in existence for over 200 years, few phy-tochemical studies of this family have previously been conducted. Studies, which haveinvestigated the phytochemical composition of species in this family, have highlightedthe flavonoid compounds. The flavonoid patterns of the Restionaceae family present dif-ferences compared to those of the related families, Juncaceae and Poaceae. In addition,various flavonoids derivatives were reported among the taxa of the restios, which couldbe attributed to the geographical origin [3,11,12]. In particular, the African species arerich in common 3-hydroxyflavones (flavonols) and flavones as aglycons or/and with theirglycosides. In the genera Elegia and Chondropetalum, the presence of glycosides of myricetin,laricitrin and syringetin and the absence of glycosides of flavones distinguishes themfrom the rest of the African taxa [3,11]. The rest of the African genera contain glycosidesof quercetin and glycosides of various flavones. Specifically, the flavones are luteolin,apigenin, chrysoeriol, cyanidin, orientin, iso-orientin and lucenin [11]. In contrast, theAustralian species are characterized by the existence of the flavonol, gossypetin, and theabsence of proanthocyanidins which can be found in almost all of the African species [3,11].Interestingly, from the 42 African species that were examined, 88% of them containedproanthocyanidins, while only 4% of the 115 Australian species contained them [13]. More-over, the presence of gossypetin instead of quercetagetin is considered as a characteristicof a more \u201cancient\u201d family since the latter is found in families that are more chemicallyadvanced. This hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic theory that Restionaceae is arelatively unspecialized family and is ancestral to the Poaceae and the Eriocaulaceae [14].A study by Harborne et al. (1985) investigated 11 species of the genus Chondropetalum,showing that even within the genus there are differences in the chemical profile of theflavonoids. In contrast, many of these species revealed numerous similarities with speciesof the genus Elegia. In fact, most of the examined Chondropetalum species were eventuallyreclassified and now belong to the genus Elegia and the rest are classified in the genusAskidiosperma [2,7]. According to Harborne et al. (1985) the species were divided into twogroups based on their 3-hydroxyflavone (flavonol) aglycons. The first group included mostspecies re-classified to the genus Elegia and contained glycosides of myricetin, laricitrin andsyringetin. Whereas the second group consisted of mainly Askidiosperma species, whichcontain quercetin, kaempferol, gossypetin, 7\u2032-methyl-ether of gossypetin and herbacetin4\u2032-methyl ether. It is important to note that the different flavonoid quantity of E. macrocarparesulted in the classification of this species into the second group. With regards to thepresence of proanthocyanidins, both procyanidin and prodelphinidin were identified inspecies of the first group (Elegia species), while only procyanidin was present in the secondgroup [12].

Potential Pharmacological Activities and Clinical StudiesEven though the phytochemistry of the genus Elegia has been studied in some degree,there are no research for the potential biological activities of its compounds. This fact isvery puzzling, since many Elegia species contain flavonols and some contain proantho-cyanidins [12,13]. 3-Hydroxyflavones (flavonols) are one of the most abundant classesof flavonoids that possess many important pharmacological activities [15,16]. In gen-eral, flavonols display a significant antioxidant activity. Specifically, kaempferol (1) andSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4 9 of 11quercetin (2), as well as their glycosides possess antioxidant activity [16\u201318]. Furthermore,many flavonols such as kaempferol (1), quercetin (2), and myricetin (4) are known to in-hibit numerous enzymes [16]. In addition, kaempferol (1) and quercetin (2) have shownantineoplastic and anti-ulcer activity [16]. Many studies have reported the anti-microbialand the anti-inflammatory activities of several flavonols [16\u201319]. Myricetin (4) could befound in many diets and it has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerand neuroprotective activity [20]. Moreover, myricetin (4) has exerted antidiabetic, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular, analgesic and antihypertensive activity [20,21].Myricetin 3-galactoside (5) and myricetin 3-rhamnoside (7) have shown in vitro antioxidantand antigenotoxic activity [22,23]. In addition, myricetin 3-galactoside (5) has demon-strated antinociceptive, anticatabolic and anti-inflammatory activities [24,25]. Recently, thiscompound has exhibited anti-osteoporotic properties [26]. Laricitrin (8) and syringetin(11) are less common flavonols and they have not been thoroughly studied compared tokaempferol or quercetin. Syringetin 3-galactoside (12) has shown antioxidant potentialthrough DPPH method, which was higher than \u03b1-tocopherol [27]. Likewise, laricitrin (8)has indicated strong antioxidant activity in DPPH test [28].Proanthocyanidins have been mentioned to possess various and promising pharmaco-logical properties [29]. In particular, they have shown antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic,neuroprotective, and antimicrobial activities. Thus, their presence reinforces the alreadypharmaceutically interesting phytochemical profile of Elegia species.The species E. tectorum was included in a recently conducted research project thatinvestigated the potential of twenty-seven indigenous South African plants. They weretested for the treatment of acne, skin hyperpigmentation, wrinkles (elastase inhibition),periodontal diseases, tuberculosis and cancer [30]. The ethanolic extract of E. tectorumwas studied for its antibacterial activity against Cutibacterium acnes, Prevotella intermedia,Streptococcus mutans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. The method used wasthe serial microtiter dilution assay in which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)values for plant extract were measured. Furthermore, the ethanolic extract was exploredfor inhibition activity against elastase and tyrosinase, which are enzymes associated withwrinkle formation and pigmentation, respectively. Moreover, the cytotoxicity were testedagainst human keratinocytes (HaCat), melanoma cells (MEL-1), breast cancer cells (MCF-7)and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) [30]. The results showed that E. tectorum exhibited noantibacterial or cytotoxic activity. However, it displayed a moderate anti-tyrosinase activitywith an IC50 value of 65.26\u00b1 8.38 \u00b5g/mL and potent anti-elastase activity with an IC50 valueof 13.5 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5g/mL. The inhibitory activity against elastase of E. tectorum was comparableto ursolic acid, a known inhibitor of elastase. It is worth noting that after consecutiveliquid/liquid partitions with ethyl acetate and saturated butanol three fractions wereobtained. Of these fractions, the remaining aqueous fraction had the highest anti-elastaseactivity, but its IC50 value was lower compared to the initial ethanol extract. Furthermore,the aqueous fraction was submitted to further chromatographic techniques and gave sixsubfractions, of which none anti-elastase activity. Thus, the author assumed that thisactivity was possibly correlated to synergistic effects with the compounds presented in theethanol extract.In a clinical study, E. tectorum was tested for irritancy in twenty subjects. The resultsindicated that this plant had a mild irritant activity. Nevertheless, when tested in creamformulation it showed no skin irritation [30]. Another clinical study examined the anti-wrinkle effects of E. tectorum in twenty-six Caucasian females with Fitzpatrick skin photo-types I-III. It was concluded that the test product, compared to a placebo control, waseffective in decreasing the wrinkle depth after 28 days of use with an application rate oftwo times per day [30].7. ConclusionsThe present review described thoroughly all the existing knowledge and researchadvances of the genus Elegia L. It focused on highlighting the importance of this genus as aSci. Pharm. 2022, 90, 4 10 of 11major component of the fynbos biome, as well as its integral role in the cultural practices andeveryday life of locals. Furthermore, taking also in consideration the recent results on theanti-wrinkle effects of E. tectorum, this overview unveiled the promising role of Elegia spp.as potential medicinal plants of South Africa with rich bioactive phytochemical content.As a result, this study could be a stimulus for further research of the Elegia genus oreven the entire Restionaceae family. In addition, it could be used as a guide for scientistsin need of uncharted species that have not yet been fully explored. The fact that no Elegiaspecies has been used traditionally as a medicinal plant should not be a prohibitive factorsince scientists today have the necessary tools to unveil the hidden treasure of novelspecialized metabolites of species that may have eluded human curiosity and history upuntil today. The research that has been conducted for the Elegia genus is very limited.Though, the results which are summarized herein clearly indicate that these plants couldbe a promising source and very beneficial for the local population and economy. Furtherstudies should be carried out to acquire a better understanding on the phytochemistry andthe pharmacological properties of the Elegia species.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, N.L. and H.S.; methodology, P.L.; software, P.L.; investi-gation, P.L.; resources, P.L.; data curation, P.L. and E.-M.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.L.and E.-M.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.S., N.L. and M.N.D.C.; supervision, H.S. and N.L.
