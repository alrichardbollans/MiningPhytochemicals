Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua inflorescences. Flowers are assumed to be polli- nated by flies and are relatively short-lived surviv- ing for 3\u20134 days. The flowering season ranges from October to March (peaking between November and January) in the south of the equator and from May to August (peaking in June to July) in the north of the equator.7 M. whitei grows from a large, tuberous rootstock and the roots have a very distinct vanilla aroma which has been attributed to the presence of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde. The roots grow laterally and may spread out just beneath the soil surface covering large areas, making them easy to harvest.6,8 The fruit is an ovoid follicle which dehisces to release an estimated 180\u2013320 seeds that are wind-dispersed.6,7 M. whitei predominantly occurs in moist to wet forests and it is easily found in vegetation types which range from swamp forest, swampy shrubby grassland and riverine forest to disturbed forest at 1800 m of altitude.7 M. whitei is endemic in almost all African regions except in the Northern part while in the western region this species is commonly found in Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria. In the central region, it is found in Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Cameroon meanwhile in the eastern region, this species can be found in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.7,8 In the southern region, M. whitei was reported in South Africa, Malawi, Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.7 In South Africa, M. whitei is mainly found in the KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo Provinces. In KwaZulu-Natal, the species is restricted to the midlands as well as lower, frost- free elevations; often near the coastal areas where colonies are becoming scarce in protected swamps.9 Taxonomy Mondia whytei (Hook .f.) skeels belongs to the family formerly Asclepiadaceae sub family Periplocoideae now Apocynaceae. It is commonly called \u2018White\u2019s ginger\u2019 (English), \u2018La racine\u2019 (French),9 \u2018Umondi/ Mundi/Mindi\u2019 (Zulus in South Africa). In Izzi land (an Ibo speaking clan) in Ebonyi State, Nigeria it is called \u2018Akoro\u2019. Mondia whitei is endemic to South, Central, East and West Africa.10 METHODOLOGY A deep literature search was carried out in order to obtain information about the phytochemistry and bioactivities of M. whitei from various electronic databases namely PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Direct and Google scholar. The scientific name of this plant species was used as the keyword for the search, along with the terms phytochemistry, bioactivities, pharmacology and pharmacognosy. Different chemical structures of M. whitei naturally occurring compounds were drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 software package. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Ethnobotany and Microscopic features of M. whitei In traditional medicine, various parts of M. whitei are used for the management of several diseases and ailments such as impotence and sexual dysfunc- tion11,12 constipation, abdominal pain, appetite stimulant13 urinary infections, gonorrhoea,14 pains, and inducement of labor. In addition, the roots are chewed to treat stress, blood pressure.13,15 It is also used in the management of paralysis, epileptic attacks in children,15,16 and milk production in lactating mothers.17 It is used as well for the treat- ment of Kidneys, gastritis, backache and guts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).18 In Central African Republic, seeds are used as antima- larials,19,20 antiheminthics as well in the preparation of arrow poisons.13,15 Roots are used either as spices, aphrodisiacs or for the treatment of urinary tract infection, jaundice and headache, while the whole plant is used to treat diarrhea21,22 Inkoto et al.3 reported the microscopic features of M. whitei which revealed the presence of para- cytic stomata, fibers, fragments of spiral bundles, tecton hairs, parenchyma with numerous starch grains, secreting hairs, fragments of Punctated vessels, as well as lignified fibers. M. whitei is a climbing shrub medicinally used in tropical Africa. The root and root bark have a vanilla-like odour. The roots are valuable as aphro- disiac, to prevent premature ejaculation, increase sperm production and generally, to treat sexual weakness. A decoction or infusion of the roots is widely used to treat malaria, gastro-intestinal problems, pains and as restorative and appetite stimulant.10 As food, the pulverised bark of M. whitei is eaten with fish or peanuts in Democratic Republic of Congo. The fresh or dried leaves are cooked with peanut butter, and eaten as a vegetable in Central and East Africa.23 Proximate analysis of M. whitei The study on the nutritional and therapeutic values of forest foods is very much important as it will encourage people to consume substantial quantity of food and provide them with a better balance of nutrients. Wild fruits contain higher amount of nutrients and bioactive compounds than many cultivated species while fruits and vegetables contain abundant dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and large quantities of phytochemicals. 36 Discovery Phytomedicine 2018; 5(3): 34-42. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2018.67 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Microscopy features, Phytochemistry and ...

Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua Amaechi and Egesi.10 carried out the proximate anal- ysis of M. whitei fruit pulp by determining the prox- imate, mineral and vitamin composition (table 1). Their study revealed that M. whitei fruit pulp which is consumed as a wild edible fruit contain all necessary macromolecules, vitamins and minerals. M. whitei fruit has high moisture content and low energy value while the quantity of thiamin present can contribute to daily requirement in human nutri- tion. However, it was also indicated that its fruit had high potassium and sodium contents than every other mineral analyzed. There was an insignificant amount of antinutritional phytochemicals (oxalates, phytates and hydrogen cyanide) when compared to some antinutritional factors of some wild fruits, hence the fruit is not toxic for human consumption. From the above table, the authors concluded that with what was found in M. whitei fruit would therefore contribute in supplying energy needed for the body\u2019s normal function. Another study conducted in Cameroon by Bouba et al.24 reported the proximate, mineral and vitamin composition of M. whitei dried root (table 2). Phenolic and vitamin content of foods are known to have positive effects on health. Epidemiological studies have shown high intakes of phenols, vit C, vit E and carote- noid-rich vegetables to be asso- ciated with decreased in- cidence of some cancers and cardiovascular diseases.24 Phytochemistry of M. whitei Inkoto et al. reported the presence of phenolic compounds, coumarins, anthraquinones, anthocy- anins, tannins, irridoids in the roots of M. whitei while alkaloids were absent using thin layer chro- matography.3 The ethanolic fresh root bark extracts of M. whitei showed strong presence of saponins, phenols, alkaloids and tannins.25 However, Amaechi and Egesi10 reported the pres- ence of tannins, phenol, phytate, sterol, carotenoid, oxalate, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids and even measure the level of hydrogen cyanide (mg.kg-1) from the fruit of M. whitei on fresh weight basis. Reported that the leaves of M. whitei contain saponins, flavonoids, tannins, resins and they are devoided of cyanogenetic glycosides, anthraqui- none, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. From the root, Wacho et al.26 reported the presence of reduc- ing sugars, triterpenes and steroids in aqueous and hexane extracts. This proves the variability of compounds in different parts of the plant. The compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde was identi\ufb01ed as the artifactual alkaloid precursor. Its isomers (vanillin and isovanillin) do not show detectable reactivity towards ammonia. Mass spectrome- try and TLC analyses con\ufb01rmed the reactivity of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde to dopamine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine and sero- tonin. The structures of these isolated compounds are presented in the figure below. This variation in different parts of M. whitei could be due to certain environemental factors, seasonal variations or differences in varieties of the species.27 Identification of compounds was from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) spectra, using retention time and mass spectrum, *RI = Retention indices on HP-5 ms capillary column, **RI = Retention indices from literature32,33 on DBS capillary column. The author concluded that the volatile oil of M. whitei root is very rich in (E)-2-hexen-1-ol and heptacosane.

Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua of the strong antibacterial activity. Fred-Jaiyesimi and Ogunjobi27 carried out as well as fluorescence screening on the leaves of M. whitei which reacted with different chemicals reagents displaying colour reactions in normal daylight and under the UV light at both 254 nm and 366 nm. These reactions exhibited enabled the characterization and identi- fication of the purity of the leaf of M. whitei. The table below presents these data. Bioactivity of M. whitei Antimicrobial activity Idayat and Sakiru34 reported the antibacterial activity of methanol extract of the root against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Another study showed that it has the extracts of M. whitei exhibited good antimicrobial activities against Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli which are among the major bacteria associated with diarrhea.35 Meanwhile Idayat and Sakiru 34 showed that, only aqueous extracts displayed a significant antimicrobial activ- ity whereas the root part was more active than the leaf. Moreover, Bongo et al.2 reported that the ethanolic extract and the dichlorom\u00e9thane fraction of M. whitei (Root bark) showed a very low anti- microbial activity against laboratory strains namely Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 9027. Gbadamosi and Aboaba33 reported as well the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the root of M. whitei based on the activity of essential oils of the root against nine clinical strains of pathogens Table 2 Proximate, Mineral and Vitamin composition of M. whitei root on dry weight basis Parameters Expression Experimental Values Proximate composition Moisture g/100 g 10.5 \u00b1 0.1 Ash g/100 g 8.7 \u00b1 0.1 Proteins g/100 g 4.7 \u00b1 0.1 Non protein Nitrogen g/100 g 0.47 \u00b1 0.01 Fats g/100 g 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 Carbohydrate g/100 g 21.4 \u00b1 0.1 Energy value kCal/100 g 40.80 \u00b1 5.56 Mineral composition Calcium mg/100 g 1060 \u00b1 53 Magnesium mg/100 g 532 \u00b1 27 Sodium mg/100 g 21.4 \u00b1 0.9 Potassium mg/100 g 593 \u00b1 23 Iron mg/100 g 102.1 \u00b1 5.3 Selenium mg/100 g 0.00 Manganese mg/100 g 6.6 \u00b1 0.3 Zinc mg/100 g 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 Copper mg/100 g 0.16 \u00b1 0.01 Total phenol, total carotenoid and Vitamin composition Total phenols mg/100 g 1.9 \u00b1 0.0 Vitamin A (Total carotenoids) \u00b5g/g 8.4 \u00b1 0.1 Vitamin E \u00b5g/g 3.6 \u00b1 0.1 Vitamin C mg/100 g 0.4 \u00b1 0.0 (Source: Bouba et al.24) Table 3 Model system used, pharmacological action and plant part of biologically active compounds isolated from M. whitei Phytochemical components present/ identified Parts of the plant Experimental model Bioactive effects or the pharmacological use References Saponins Root bark Wistar albino rats Antidiarrheal activity and antiepileptic activities 25 Phenolic alkaloids Root bark Wistar albino rats Antidiarrheal activity and antiepileptic activities 25,28 Tannins Root bark Wistar albino rats Antidiarrheal activity and antiepileptic activities 25,28 Flavonoids Leaves Wistar albino rats Antidiarrheal activity and antiepileptic activities 28 9-Hexacosene Root Adult Swiss albino mice aged Analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities 29,30 Stigmasterol Root Adult Swiss albino mice aged ; Male Swiss albino mice weighing Analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities 29,30 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Discovery Phytomedicine 2018; 5(3): 34-42. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2018.67 39 Microscopy features, Phytochemistry and ... Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua namely Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. They concluded that the root was the most active part of the plant and it is the part which is highly consumed. Anti-diarrheal activity Ndukui et al.25 reported that the ethanolic fresh root bark extract of M. whitei has anti- diarrheal activity and it\u2019s safe for use, thus corroborates with its traditional use. The anti-diarrheal action may be linked partly to direct inhibitory effect of the extract on the propulsive movement of the gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle, increased electrolytes and fluid absorption and infiltration in the tissue. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities Githinji et al.29 reported that Stigmasterol (15 mg/kg) and 9-hexacosene (30 mg/kg) signifi- cantly (p<0.05) inhibited chemical nociception induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid. Stigmasterol (7.5, 15, 30 and 100 mg/kg) dose dependently reduced the time spent in pain beha-vior in both the early and late phases of the formalin test. 9-hexacosene dose dependently caused significant (p<0.001) antinociceptive effect on the late phase of the formalin test. The Co-administration of nalox- one failed to antagonize the analgesic activity of stig- masterol and 9-hexacosene in the formalin test. They concluded that both stigmasterol and 9-hexacosene possess potential analgesic effects which are most likely mediated by their anti-inflammatory activities rather than through opioid receptor system. Antinociceptive activity Stigmasterol reduced the time spent licking, biting and/or lifting the injected paw in both the early and late phases of the formalin test. This reduction was found to be dose dependent and statistically signif- icant (p<0.001) at a dose of 30mg/kg body weight. 9-hexacosene produced dose-dependent and statis- tically significant (p<0.001) antinociceptive effect on the late phase of the formalin test at a dose of 7.5mg/kg body weight. No motor, neurological or other behavioral deficits were observed.30 Antisickling and antioxidant activities The ethanolic extact and dichlorormethane frac- tion of the root bark of M. whitei exhibited strong antisickling activity in vitro.2 From our previous Table 4 Components of essential oil of M. whitei root S/N Compound *RI **RI Composition (%) 1 Cyclohexylmethane 781 - 2.09 2 Toluene 794 785 0.87 3 (E)-2-Hexenal 814 846 4.29 4 1-Hexanol 862 863 8.94 5 (E)-2-Hexen-1-ol 868 859 25.96 6 m-Xylene 907 893 1.56 7 p-Xylene 907 893 0.77 8 1-Octen-3-one 943 969 1.25 9 3-Octanone 952 962 1.37 10 1-Octen-3-ol 969 974 2.24 11 3-Octanol 979 989 2.68 12 Benzaldehyde 982 999 0.21 13 Linalool 1082 1088 3.02 14 2-Methyl-2-nonen-4-one 1136 - 0.69 15 Fenchol 1138 1147 0.21 16 Safranal 1186 1196 0.39 17 \u03b2-Cyclocitral 1204 1200 0.21 18 4,4,7a-Trimethyl-2,4,5,6,7,7a- hexahydro-1H-inden-1-one 1371 - 0.41 19 2-Hydroxy-p-anisaldehyde 1392 - 4.21 20 Megastimatrienone 1454 1462 0.28 21 \u03b2-Ionone 1457 1460 2.1 22 Dodecanoic acid 1570 1550 0.46 23 Apiole 1705 1697 0.48 24 Hexahydrofamesylacetone 1754 1751 0.62 25 Isobutyl phthalate 1908 - 0.36 26 Phytol 2045 2045 15.6 27 Heptacosane 2705 2705 20.94 28 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid dinonyl ester 2965 - 4.96 Total 99.92 Monoterpene hydrocarbons 0.00 Oxygenated monoterpene 3.62 Sesquiterpene hydrocarbon 0.00 Oxygenated sesquiterpene 2.59 Diterpene 15.60 Non-terpenes 78.12 Total 99.92 40 Discovery Phytomedicine 2018; 5(3): 34-42. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2018.67 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Microscopy features, Phytochemistry and ... Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua work, it was stated that the dichlorormethane frac- tions of M. whitei showed different IC50 values <100 \u00b5g/mL with the ABTS test. Gbadamosi and Erinoso also reported that the percentage of inhi- bition of DPPH free radicals was 32.57% for the leaf and the root had 47.23%. The high antioxidant activity of the root could be attributed to its poly- phenolic content.34 Antiepileptic activity Adediwura and Oluwatosin28 stated that the extract and fractions exhibited a dose-dependent effect in the delay of the onset of seizures and reduction in the duration of a seizure. Aphrodisiac activity Some studies showed the anecdotal evidence of M. whitei effectiveness as an aphrodisiac. Motility parameters on Aqueous extract administration to human spermatozoa in vitro showed significantly enhanced total motility as well as progressive motil- ity in a time dependent manner.36 As reported, these findings support the use of M. whitei especially in men affected with asthenozoospermia,37 but its mode of action is not clear. The effect of aqueous and hexane extract of Mondia whitei have also been shown to sexually enhanced sexually inexperienced male rats.36 Enough scientific evidence have support the anecdotal use of M. whitei as an aphrodisiac and it may be working synergistically by activating NOS that increases the level of cGMP that can cause cross activation for the generation of cAMP as well as hyperpolarization.36 Since the in vitro studies proves that M. Whitei can cause blockade of voltage-operated calcium channels, it is likely to directly activate cGK1 that can be an interest- ing target for pharmacological intervention in the management of Erectile Dysfunction.36 Toxicological activity Gakunga et al.38 reported the LD50 was above 5000 mg/kg while no signs of toxicity and mortality observed in the various treatment groups within 7 days of observation post single dose exposure. Doses above 5000 mg/kg in plant experiments are considered to be experimentally safe according to EPA and OECD toxic substances classification. The study was carried out as recommended by (25-29). Dikibo et al.39 showed that while normal brain cells were presented in the control (group A), group B presented cellular pyknosis, necrosis, degener- ative vacoulations, and mild infarction without gliosis. Group C showed cellular degeneration, pyknosis, gliosis/astrocytosis, vacoulation, while group D showed cellular degeneration, pyknosis and parenchymal erosion. The observed histologi- cal changes were duration dependent and suggest that Mondia whitei is toxic to the brain and may induce neurotoxic damages in a duration depen- dent manner. Hence, there is a need for further research on the effects of M. whitei on other organs and system. CONCLUSION Medicinal plant species are rich in secondary metab- olites of pharmaceutical relevance.

Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua evidence supporting the multiple uses of M. whitei in Traditional Medicine. Chemically, this plant contains a wide range of secondary metabolites as well as minerals which could be responsible for different reported therapeutic activities. Therefore, M. whitei could be of considerable interest for the development of plant-based new anticancer drugs for human health and wellbeing according to it richness in essential oils. Findings from previous studies lead to further research on bioactivities of volatile oil of M. whitei precisely on its therapeutic values in the manage- ment of infectious diseases (diarrhea, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted infec- tions and skin infections) The root of M. whitei was proven to be very active and rich in essential oils; this justifies the high of consumption of M. whitei root by African population though many people eat it as an aphro- disiac for sexual stimulation.
