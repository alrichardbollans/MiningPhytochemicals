E-mail: goddyebong@yahoo.com_________________________________________________________________________________________Abstract : The phytochemical, antibacterial and anticoagulase activities of Sida acuta against clinical isolates ofStaphylococcus aureus were investigated. The phytochemistry of the plant leaves revealed that S. acuta is laden withantioxidative compounds with remarkable concentrations of saponins (0.772 mg/100g), flavonoids (0.112 mg/100g),alkaloids (0.076 mg/100g) and tannins (0.0541mg/100g). Their presence conferred a strong bactericidal effect onStaphylococcus aureus SS-1VC, Staph. aureus SS-2VM, Staph. aureus SS-3SW, Staph aureus SS-4OM, Staph. aureusSS-5BC Staph. aureus SS-6AF and Staph. aureus SS-7DS isolated from vaginal candidiosis, vaginal mycosis, septicwound, otitis media, buccal cavity, athletes foot and diarrheic stool respectively. Majority of the bacterium strainsscreened were sensitive to aqueous and methanol extracts of S. acuta leaves. All the strains were inhibited by theaqueous extract, but more susceptible were strains SS-2VM isolated from vaginal mycoses and SS-3SW from septicwound, which recorded 25mm and 24mm diameter of inhibition zones respectively, after treatment with 8.0mg/ml ofthe extract. However, much lower concentration (0.5mg/ml) of the extract was required to halt coagulase activity in bothstrains. The methanol leaf extract exhibited similar but stronger antibacterial and anticoagulase activities against theclinical isolates of Staph. aureus. Marked antibacterial inhibitory effects were observed against most strains testedbut SS-6AF and SS-7DS (which exhibited comparatively lower susceptibility), with majority of the strains losing theiranticoagulase producing potential at concentrations as low as 0.5mg/ml of alcoholic extract. The strong anticoagulaseactivity of S.acuta, and it\u2019s efficacy in inhibiting coagulase elaboration by Staph aureus especially Staph. aureus SS-3SW isolated from septic wound forms the basis of it\u2019s use in folk medicine for wound treatment.Keywords: Phytochemistry, Antibacterial and Anticoagulase, Sida acuta,Staphylococcus aureus_________________________________________________________________________________________INTRODUCTIONThe usefulness of ethnobotanical surveys in drugdiscovery has been reviewed by many researchers(Benjamin, 1980; Sofowara, 1984; Odoemena et al., 1998;Dhawan, 1997; Essien et al., 1999; Ekpendu et al., 2000and Essien and Akpan, 2004). Naturally occurring plantmetabolites are useful sources of new biocidal compoundsand some cases have served as leads for new compoundsthat have been characterized (Emele et al., 1997 and Essienand Akpan, 2004). However the search for newantimicrobial agents is a continuous exercise since targetmicroorganisms often evolve new genetic variants(Agarwal et al., 1980, Locksley et al., 1982, Hughes andDatta, 1983 and Oyagade and Oguntoyinbo, 1997).Development of resistance to antimicrobial agents bystaphylococci is of major concern primarily because theyare frequently associated with hospital and communityacquired infections (Agarwal et al., 1980, Iroegbu et al.,1997 and Oyagade and Oguntoyinbo, 1997).Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous microorganism.The young and debilitated individual are known to harborthis bacterium in their anterior nare (Ako-Nai et al., 1991)and other parts of the body (Famurewa and Sonntag, 1982).Staphylococcus aureus is a normal flora of some parts ofthe body such as the skin and nasal passage. It producespustules, carbuncles and boils. It is also a frequent causeof burns and wound sepsis (Bulanda, 1989; and Oyagadeand Oguntoyinbo, 1997). The virulence factors producedby human strains of Staph. aureus include a-toxins,protein A and coagulase. Other factors include the y-toxinswhich damages the tissue cells by its action as a phospho-lipase and lipase which catalyses the hydrolysis of fatsand oils in the sebaceous secretion and blood plasma(Henning et al., 1979 and Oyagade and Oguntoyinbo,1997). Apart from being associated with wound infections.Staph. aureus may contaminate food resulting in foodpoisoning which is a common cause of vomiting anddiarrhea, and staphylococcal enterocolitis (Duguid et al.,1987).Although the resistance of Staph. aureus to someantibiotics have been reported (Ako-Nai et al., 1991 andOyagade et al., 1997), the bacterium is sensitive to manyantibiotics (Duguid et al., 1987) and many traditional plantherbs and concoctions have been reported to have someISSN : 0974-9411 All Rights Reserved \u00a9 Applied and Natural Science Foundation www.ansfoundation.org2008APPLIED A NDNATURALSCIEN CEF OUNDATIONANSF2medicinal value against Staph. aureus associated ailmentsincluding septic wounds. Certain drug plants Centellaasiatica and Aloe vera have been used for decades, bothtopically and internally, to enhance wound repair(MacKay and Miller,2003), and scientific studies are nowbeginning to validate efficacy and explore mechanisms ofaction for these drug plants. A typical example is the useof Sida acuta Burn F. (Malvaceae) as an astringent, coolingtonic and antipyretic herb. It is also a useful antimicrobialagent in nervous and urinary disorders, wound infectionand diseases of the blood and bile (Peirce, 2000). Howeverto the best of our knowledge a systematic study on thewound healing activity of S. acuta has not beenundertaken and little is known about the efficacy or theextent of effectiveness of the plant leaf extracts againstpathogenic microorganisms. In the present research weinvestigate the phytochemistry, antibacterial andanticoagulase activities of Sida acuta against clinicalisolates of Staph. aureus.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhytochemistry of Sida acuta leaves : Preliminaryphytochemical analysis of the petroleum ether extract ofthe plant leaves was carried out according to the methodsoutlined by Harborne (1984) and Evans (1998). Precisely,500g of the fine sample powder was successfully Soxhletextracted with petroleum ether at room temperature (28 \u00b12oC). The extract was concentrated under pressure to yield40g of petroleum ether-extract. Screening for alkaloids wascarried out with Mayer\u2019s, Dragendroff\u2019s and Picric acidreagents. Cardiac glycosides were detected by the Keller-Killiani and Liberman\u2019s tests. The tannins were detectedby the Ferric Chloride test, phlobatannins by hydrochloricacid test, saponins by the Frothing and Fehling\u2019s tests,flavonoids by Shinoda\u2019s test, sterol/triterpenes bysulphuric acid test and the anthraquinones by theBontruger\u2019s test. The incidence of the antioxidants in theplant leaves was graded as being highly present (+++),moderately present (++), present in trace amount (+) andabsent (-).Quantitative measurements of total crude sapogeninswere by gravimetric method of Brain et al (1968), Alkaloidwas quantified by the Harborne (1984), tannin by Van-Burden and Robinson (1981) method and flavonoid bythe method of Boham and Kocipai-Abyazan (1974), whilethe method of Obadoni and Ochuko (2001) was adoptedfor saponin determination.Clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus screened :Staphylococcus aureus SS-1VC originally isolated fromvaginal candidiosis, Staph. aureus SS-2VM isolated fromvaginal mycosis, Staph. aureus SS-3SW isolated fromseptic wound, Staph aureus SS-4OM isolated from otitismedia, Staph. aureus SS-5BC isolated from buccal cavity,Staph. aureus SS-6AF isolated from athletes foot andStaph. aureus SS-7DS isolated from diarrheic stool wereobtained from the diagnostic laboratory of the Universityof Uyo Health Centre, Nigeria.The isolates were streaked on selective media of bloodagar, mannitol salt agar and staphylococcus medium 110.The inoculated plates were incubated at 37oC for 24 hoursand the emerging colonies were purified by repeated sub-culturing and stocked in nutrient agar slants. Thereafter,the isolates were characterized according to the methodsdescribed by Cowan (1985) and Holt et al (1994) toascertain their identities.Preparation of leaf extracts for antibacterial andanticoagulase assays : Fresh Sida acuta plants werecollected from the wild sources in Uyo, Nigeria andauthenticated by a plant taxonomist. The leaves wereseparated, sundried and powdered for easy extraction.Precisely, 75g of leaf powder was extracted with 700 ml of95% methanol in a Soxhlet apparatus at 60-75oC. Extractwas concentrated by evaporation using a rotaryevaporator to obtain a pasty oily residue. The traditionalextraction process in which 100g of the leaf powder (100g)was refluxed with 400ml of sterile double distilled waterfor 1 hour at 75oC (MacKay and Miller, 2003) was alsoadopted. It was cooled and then filtered. This was repeatedin three trials. The extracts were pooled and evaporatedusing a lyophilizer to obtain 250mg/ml extractconcentration.Aliquot of the methanol extract was adjusted using steriledistilled water, to match the concentration derived fromthe aqueous extract. Serially diluted antibacterial of theextracts were prepared to obtain graded concentrationsfor the assays.Antibacterial assay of the leaf extracts : Antibacterialassay of the plant extracts was by the agar-punch-tubemethod (Stokes,1975), a modification of the agar-diffusionmethod of Bauer et al. (1966) using Oxoid single sensitivitydisc and Mueller-Hinton agar as the sensitivity testmedium. The inoculum was standardized by streakingisolates of Staph. aureus from nutrient agar slants intomannitol salt agar and then incubated at 370C for 24 hours.Distinct colonies of the emerging isolates were transferredinto 5ml of nutrient broth and then incubated for 5 hoursuntil its turbidity matched that of barium sulphate solution(Cheesbrough, 1985).Using different concentrations of the methanol andaqueous extracts and by the agar-dilution method (Stokes,1975) the antibacterial effect of graded concentration ofextracts were determined for the 7 clinical strains of Staph.aureus screened. This procedure described byCruickshank et al. (1982) has previously been used byEmele et al. (1997).J. P. Essien et al. /J. Appl. & Nat. Sci. 1(1): 1-7 (2009)3Anticoagulase assay of the leaf extracts : Coagulase testis based on the ability of Staph. aureus to produce aprotein product called coagulase. The test is usuallycarried out to differentiate the pathogenic Staph. aureusfrom other strains or species of staphylococci. Coagulasecauses plasma to clot by converting fibrinogen to fibrin.Bound coagulase (clumping factor) which convertsfibrinogen directly to fibrin without requiring a coagulasereacting factor can be detected by the clumping of bacterialcells in the rapid slide techniques.To determine the anticoagulase potential of the leafextracts, 0.2ml of broth cultures of each isolate was addedto 0.5ml of the extract solution and incubated in a waterbath at 37oC. With known control, the test substrate wasexamined at intervals of 30 minutes for 4 hours(Cheesbrough, 1985 and Cowan, 1985). The effect of thedifferent extracts concentrations on the coagulaseactivities of the Staph. aureus isolates was investigatedusing inhibited cultures and by the tube test.For the tube test, free coagulase which convertsfibrinogen to fibrin by activating a coagulase reactingfactor present in plasma which is indicated by clottingwas assayed. To achieve these three clean sterile testtubes were prepared; the first tube containing the inhibitedtest culture and medium (0.8ml of 24 hour old brothculture), the second tube which served as the positivecontrol contained the uninhibited broth culture while thethird tube which served as the negative control had sterilebroth. With the aid of sterile pipette 0.2ml of plasma wastransferred into each test tube, mixed gently and incubatedat 37oC for 1 hour. Observations were made to distinguishpositive coagulase which showed clotting of tube content.The time or duration of clotting was determined with theaid of a stop watch (Quartz mechanical stop watch).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStaphylococcus aureus has been one of the mostsuccessful of pathogenic bacteria due to its possessionof aggressive factors and enzymes that can hydrolyze awide range of substances (Volk et al., 1986). Among thesefactors is the production of coagulase, an enzyme-likeprotein that clots oxalated or citrated plasma in thepresence of a factor contained in many sera. The serumfactor reacts with coagulase to generate both esteraseand clotting activities, in a manner similar to the activationof prothrombin to thrombin (Vassey and Mann, 1978).Coagulase may deposit fibrin on the surface ofStaphylococcus aureus perhaps altering their ingestionor destruction by phagocytic cells (Volk et al., 1986, Vasseyand Mann, 1978). The present study has shown that boththe aqueous and methanol leaf extracts of Sida acuta areladen with antioxidative compounds with remarkableconcentrations of saponins (0.772 mg/100g), flavonoids(0.112 mg/100g), alkaloids (0.076 mg/100g) and tannins(0.0541mg/100g) (Table 1). These antioxidants have stronganticoagulase and antibacterial potentials. Its stronganticoagulase activity forms the basis for its use, andefficacy in inhibiting coagulase elaboration by thebacterium. However, the plant\u2019s anticoagulase activityvaried with the bacterium strain and extractsconcentration.The aqueous extract (Table 2) delayed coagulaseelaboration (plasma clotting within 30 minutes) by Staph.aureus strain SS-1VC isolated from vaginal cavity.Coagulase activity was noticed on the 32nd minute,precisely 29 minutes after the activity was noticed (within3 minutes) in the untreated culture of the test strain whichserved as control. Similarly, the coagulase activity ofStaph. aureus strains SS-5BC isolated from the buccalcavity and SS-6AF from athlete\u2019s foot were also delayedfor 8 minutes and 14 minutes respectively at the highestconcentration (8.0mg/ml) of extract applied. The delay incoagulase production by strains SS-1VC, SS-5BC and SS-6AF is an indication of the resistance of the isolates tothe anticoagulase properties of the plant extract, and apointer to the fact that the pathogens may not necessarilyloss its virulence when treated with aqueous extract ofSida acuta despite their susceptibility to antibacterialproperties of the plant. This implies that both attributeshave different physiological determinants.All the bacterial strains were inhibited by the aqueousextract, but more susceptible were strains SS-2VM isolatedfrom vaginal mycoses and SS-3SW from septic wound,which recorded 25mm and 24mm diameter of inhibitionzones respectively, after treatment with 8.0mg/ml of theextract. Much lower concentration (0.5mg/ml) of the extractwas required to halt coagulase activity in both strains.Other isolates with disrupted coagulase activities wereSS-4OM (isolated from otitis media) at 4.0mg/ml and SS-7DS (isolated from diarrheic stool) at 2.0mg/ml of extractconcentrations. Staphylococcus aureus strains SS-6AFand SS-7DS were the most resistant isolates to theantibacterial components of the aqueous extract.The methanol leaf extract (Table 3) exhibited similar butstronger anticoagulase and antibacterial activities againstthe clinical isolates of Staph. aureus. Marked antibacterialinhibitory effects were observed against most strainstested but SS-6AF and SS-7DS (which exhibitedcomparatively lower susceptibility), with majority of thestrains losing their anticoagulase producing potential atconcentrations as low as 0.5mg/ml of alcoholic extract.The stronger efficacy of the alcoholic extract againstcoagulase production and bacterial growth may beattributed to the more concentrated level of antioxidantsin the methanol extract. This is suggestive that alcohol,as better solvent might have extracted more activecomponents of the plant leaves than water. However infolk medicine S. acuta leaf extract are mostly applied inJ. P.

Our findings haveshown that better results may be achieved if alcoholicextract of the plant leaf is applied or even if used in driedpowdery form. Similar observations have previously beenreported by Emele et al (1997). This stems from the factthat the aqueous extract though with appreciableanticoagulase activity has limited antibacterial activityagainst many infectious strains of Staphylococcusaureus.Our observation is in agreement with previous report thatcorrelations between strains isolated from particulardiseases and expression of particular virulencedeterminants, which suggest their role in a particulardisease (Bergdoll, 1970) generally show that differentTable 1.

Thereforecontrolling the rate of either using S. acuta leaf extractmay retard the pathogenicity of Staph aureus. However,halting both the coagulase and cells multiplication wouldenhance healing of wound sepsis caused by Staph.aureus.Fig. 3. Relationship between coagulase and antibacterialactivities in Staph. aureus SS-6AF.6ConclusionWound contraction is the process of mobilizing healthyskin surrounding the wound to cover the denuded area(Shanbhag et al., 2006). The centripetal movement of thewound margin is believed to be due to activity ofmyofibroblast (Gabbaiani et al., 1976). Like other woundhealing botanicals such as Kaempferia galanga, theanticoagulase and antibacterial activities of Sida acutaagainst wound sepsis inducing strain of Staph. aureuswould enhanced the contractile property of myofibroblastor increased the number of myofibroblasts recruited intothe wound area. Our research have shown that its potentialto enhance the property of myofibroblast via reducedanticoagulase and enhanced antibacterial activities ofwound sepsis causing Staph. aureus varies withetiological strain, extract concentrations, nature of woundand the method in which the extracts were derived.Alcoholic extract exhibited stronger efficiency thanaqueous extract usually used by traditional wound healersin folk medicine. These findings may reflect the differentmodes of action of the unrefined antioxidative componentsof the plant leaf.In recent years oxidative stress has been implicated in avariety of degenerative process and diseases. Theseinclude acute and chronic inflammatory condition suchas wound healing (Maiere and Chan, 2002). Woundhealing plants are known to possess antioxidantsespecially flavonoids which are responsible for free radicalscavenging activity required for wound healing (Devipriyaand Shyamaladevi, 1999). Phytochemical screeningrevealed the presence of remarkable concentration offlavonoids in Sida acuta. This plus the presence of otherantioxidants, such as saponins, tannins and alkaloidscould be the reason for the strong anticoagulase andantibacterial potentials, and pro-healing activity of S.acuta.REFERENCESAgarwal, S.
