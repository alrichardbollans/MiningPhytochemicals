Results revealed ascorbic acid and chlorophyll contents of 158.2+0.7mg/100g and 5.8+0.1mg/100g respectively in fresh leaf samples, while plant extracts contained abundant Tannin, Cardiac glucoside and Flavonoids with moderate amounts of Alkaloid, Saponin and Terpene. Acute toxicity of extracts determined by administering crude ethnaolic extracts intraperitoneally to rats at a dose range of 200mg/kg-1000mg/kg revealed an LD50 of 480 mg/kg. Three fractions (n-hexane, ethylacetate and n-butanol) were obtained and screened for rat growth promoting potentials. Results of weight, water intake and feed consumption revealed a net gain of 57.7g (22%) and 30.4g (11%) in weight; increased water intake of 3.9ml (19.7%) and 1.3ml (17%) and increased feed consumption of 1.5g (12.9%) and 1.3g (11.6%) in rats after 28 days treatment with n-butanol and ethylacetate fractions respectively. Studies of haematological potentials of n-butanol fraction of T. occidentalis leaf extracts showed significant (P<0.05) increase in Red Blood cells level (6.19+0.20x106/L), Haemoglobin (18.36+0.84g/dL) and platelet counts (747.33+2.03x103/mL). When compared to other fractions, the butanol fraction had the highest haematological activity, and additional analysis suggested that the bioactive molecule B2b may be responsible for this. The findings suggest that butanol fraction B2b is a safe and potent hematinic capable of alleviating anemic conditions, and they also confirm the use of T. occidentalis leaf decoction in traditional medicine for the treatment of anemia and other blood-related disorders, suggesting that it could be prescribed as an adjunct to dietary and main anemia therapy.

According to the World Health Organization, four billion people, or almost 80% of the world's population, use plants and plant components in Medicare (WHO, 2004). Following this reliance on plants for therapeutic purposes, there has been a resurgence of interest in plant study and usage in the last several decades. The present prevalent assumption that green medicine is inexpensive, safe, trustworthy, and more accessible than expensive synthetic medications, which may be linked with unpleasant side effects, has sparked an interest in plant-derived pharmaceuticals (Adeneye and Benebo, 2007). Many plants, in addition to providing nutrients, contain a variety of effective bioactive compounds that can produce a variety of physiological effects depending on the mode of application and have been shown to aid in the treatment of tropical diseases such as malaria (Elujoba, Odeleye, and Ogunyemi, 2005), sickle-cell anemia (Okigbo and Menke, 2006), microbial infection (Iwu, Duncan, and Okuriji, 1999), diabetes (Akah et al., 2009) and (Imafidon and Okunrobo, 2012). Many edible plants have medical value in addition to being edible (Udofia et al., 2012), and much is known about medicinal plants because they include a large number of therapeutically effective elements that may be used as starting materials for medicines (Sofowora, 1984). The study of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine to alleviate illnesses is gaining popularity. This method was also advised and supported by the World Health Organization, particularly in nations where access to conventional therapy is limited (WHO, 1980). The WHO has also underlined that while choosing herbal medication for use in healthcare, safety should be the most important factor to consider. It has been noted that Telfairia occidentalis is used to cure ailments, and certain reports back this up (Asiegbu, 1987; Ajayi et al., 2000; Fasuyi and Nonyerem, 2007). In Nigeria, T. Phytochemistry, and Effects of Telfairia occidentalis Leaf Extracts\u2026.. 318 UDOSEN IR; OSU SR occidentalis (pumpkin) is an extensively utilized indigenous plant. It is mostly used for nutritional benefits, although it has recently been utilized for medicinal purposes. It's been used for centuries as a digestive tonic, an appetizer, and a cure for dizziness and anemia. T. occidentalis is high in chlorophyll and ascorbic acid, according to the results of this study. Tannin, cardiac glycoside, and flavonoids are just a few of the phytochemicals found in T. occidentalis. The purpose of this study was to see how T. occidentialis leaf extracts affected rat growth and hematological parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sources of Plant Materials and Animals: Fresh plants (T. occidentialis) were obtained from markets in Ikot Ekpene, Eket and Uyo Local Government Areas in Akwa Ibom State early in the morning and transported in moistened jute bags to the Department of Botany and Ecological Studies, University of Uyo for authentication and identification by taxonomists. Voucher specimen was given and specimen deposited at the Herbarium of the Department. Adult Wistar albino rats (250 - 300g) were obtained from the animal house of Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Uyo, Uyo. Animals were housed in wooden cages with wire gauze under uniform husbandry conditions of day light, night darkness, room temperature with wood shavings as their bedding materials and allowed two weeks acclimation. Ethical approval was obtained from the Animals use and Ethics committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Uyo, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Processing of Plant Materials: Fresh leaves of T. occidentialis were destalked, rinsed in tap water and spread in a single layer thickness on tray and shade-dried between 9am and 5pm. Dehydrated products were pulverized into fine powder using laboratory plant mill (Christy and Norris Ltd., Chemsford, England). About 200g of powder was loaded into a thimble and continuously extracted with 95% ethanol in a soxhlet extractor for 72 hours. The solvent was distilled off in a rotary evaporator to obtain a solid residue of 27g (13.5% W/W). The ethanol extract was fractionated by thin layer chromatographic methods using n-hexane, ethylacetate and butanol (Bobbit, 1964; Touchstone, 1992) to obtained n-hexane fraction, ethylacetate fraction and butanol fraction. Phytochemical Screening: Standard protocols (Odebiyi and Sofowora, 1978; Trease and Evans, 1986; Harbone, 1991) were used in detecting bioactive compounds in ethanol extract such as Alkaloids, Saponin, Tannin, Cardiac glycoside, falconoid, terpene and Authoraguinone. Chemical Analyses: Chlorophyll content of unextracted, dehydrated plant leaves was analyzed by spectrophotometric method while ascorbic acid was determine by the 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol titrimetric method according to AOAC (1984). The concentration of chlorophyll was calculated using \ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 ITab Where C = Concentration (mg/ml); T = Transmittance %; a = Path length (cm); b = wavelength (nm) Acute Toxicity Determination: Acute toxicity studies (LD50) of ethanol extracts of Telfairia occidentalis was carried out in rats of both sexes using the method of Lorke (1983) with slight modifications. Rats were weighed and distributed into two groups of five rats per a group. They were acclimatized for two weeks on animal feed and water ad libitum. Before experiment, animals were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water only. Two hours before onset of experiment, the water was withdrawn. The extracts obtained were administered to each rat per group intraperitoneally (i.p) at a dose range of 200mg/kg \u2013 10000mg/kg. They were monitored and observed for physical signs of toxicity and death within 24 hours. The LD50 was estimated as a geometric mean of maximum dose producing 0% mortality and minimum dose producing 100% mortality i.e. LD50 = ab Where a = maximum dose producing 0% morality; b = minimum dose producing 100% mortality Haematological Studies: The albino rats were further divided into five groups of six rats per a group. Groups I and II served as positive and negative control respectively. Group I was used as a positive control and was fed with haematinics (folic acid), Group II, negative control, fed normally without any treatment. Butanol fraction, n-hexane fraction and ethylaccetate fractions were prepared as drugs based on LD50 and administered to experimental rats. Group III was treated with butanol fraction, Group IV, with n-hexane fraction and Group V with ethylacetate fraction. The treatments were given once daily for 28 days. Rats were monitored weekly for body weight, daily for food and water intake. On day 29, rats were sacrificed and blood collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA bottles Phytochemistry, and Effects of Telfairia occidentalis Leaf Extracts\u2026.. 319 UDOSEN IR; OSU SR for determination of the following haematological parameters viz, haemoglobin level (Hb), Red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), platelet (PLT), heamatocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH). Statistical Analysis: Values were expressed as mean + SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for difference among treatments group. Fisher\u2019s Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used to assess significant difference between the controls and treated group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Chemical analyses of extracts of Telfairia occidentalis leaves revealed Ascorbic acid concentration of 158.2 + 0.7mg/100g and chlorophyll content of 5.8 + 0.1mg/100g (Table 1.) while phytochemical screening of T. occidentalis leaf extracts showed that the sample contained abundant Tannin, cardiac glycoside and flavonoid with moderate amounts of Alkaloid, Saponin and Terpene (Table 2.). Effect of chemical fractions of Telfairia occidentalis extracts based on LD50 on body weight of Wister albino rats is presented in Table 3. Results revealed that rats treated with Butanol and Ethylacetate fractions gained 57.7g and 30.4g respectively. This was encouraging when compared to 60.5g body weight gained by rates in positive control group treated with 10mg/kg folic acid. Rats in native control fed normally without treatment gained 2.7g in weight after 28 days observations. Water intake increased in butanol and ethylacetate fraction treated rats to 3.9ml and 3.4ml respectively at the end of 4 weeks (28 days). This was an improvement in water when compared with positive control (1.3ml) (Table 4). Table 5 show incremental feed intake of 1.5g and 1.3g in butanol and Ethylacetate fraction treatments whereas a marginal feed increased (0.7g) was observed in rats within the negative control group. Results of studies of haematological properties of partitioned T. occidentalis leave extracts showed a significant (P<0.05) increase in Red Blood Cells (RBC), Haemoglobin concentration (Hb), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) and Platelet (PLT) (Table 6). Leaf extract fraction treated rats showed elevated RBC level (6.19 + 0.20 x 106/l) and Hb (18.20 + 0.31g/dl). The MCV increased from 58.20 + 2.14g/ to 63.43 + 0.52gl in rats treated with 10mg/kg folic acid and butanol fraction respectively. The MCHC significantly (P<0.05) increased in rats treated with butanol fraction (39.36 + 0.84g/dl) and Ethylacetate (31.87 + 0.58g/dl) respectively.

Results further revealed that haematological activity of butanol fraction was highest when compared with other fractions and effect of purified butanol fractions of T. occidentalis leaf extracts on haematological properties in albino rats in Table 7 showed that the bioactive component B2 a and B2 b were responsible for the enhanced activities.bTelfairia occidentalis leaves contain a variety of biochemicals and phytochemicals that are all bioactive. Chlorophyll is a chemical molecule that functions as a medium for the movement of dissolved oxygen. It is found in the blood of most animals and is very similar to haemoglobin. The fundamental structure of chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring, similar to haem in haemoglobin, but with magnesium instead of iron as in haemoglobin; still, chlorophyll has the ability to act in the body as haemoglogbin due to this unique property. In this investigation, chlorophyll was shown to help experimental rats restore and refill their red blood cells. Plant leaf extract also has a high ascorbic acid concentration of 158.2 + 0.7 mg/100g, according to research (Table 1). The Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for man is 60mg (Seely et al 2002) and this will be exceeded on consumption of a hundred grammes of plant materials. Ascorbic acid is a water soluble vitamin that functions in general protein metabolism. The antioxidant qualities of this chemical (ascorbic acid) and chlorophyll can prevent oxidation of cell components by giving an electron to free radicals. The haematological activity of Telfairia occidentalis lead extracts is thought to be enhanced by these compounds. Tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenes, and cardiac glycosides were discovered to be abundant in Telfairia occidentalis leaf extracts. Flavonoids have biological effects that include protection from allergens, free radicals, and inflammation (Okwu, 2004; Okwu and Omodamiro, 2005). Flavonoids are water-soluble super antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage (Okwu, 2004). This might have had a role in the enhanced hematologic activity of the plant extract under investigation. Aside from flavoniods, additional metabolites such as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides were detected in abundance in the sample plant leaves. When given to animals, alkaloids have been discovered to have significant physiological action, whilst cardiac glycosides have been proven to be effective in the treatment of heart disorders (Trease and Evans, 1989). Butanol and Ethylacetate fractions enhanced weight, water intake, and feed consumption in experimental rats after 28 days of sub-acute research. According to Akah et al. (2009), the required renal water loss combined with hypoosmolarity tends to deplete intracellular water, triggering the osmoreceptors of the thirst center of the brain, which leads to increased water consumption (UKPDS, 1998).. Phytochemistry, and Effects of Telfairia occidentalis Leaf Extracts\u2026.. 321 UDOSEN IR; OSU SR The anabolic effects then take over, leading to an increase in feed consumption and weight gain. In this work, it was discovered that administering fractions of T. occidentalis leaf extracts improved various hematological parameters in experimental rats. RBC, Hb, MCHC, PLT, and other parameters all increased dramatically. This might explain the rats' overall happiness, as an increase in weight, water, and feed intake indicates enhanced renal and hepatic functioning. This finding is in line with previous research on the hepatoprotective properties of leaf extracts in mice (Iwalokun et al., 2006). Ingestion of medicinal substances has been demonstrated to change a variety of haematological parameters, according to the literature (Ajagbonna et al., 1999). T. occidentalis may have a physio-modulatory impact in rats, as evidenced by the significant rise in blood parameters in treated rats. The presences of diverse phytochemicals that may function as strong antioxidants and heterogeneous phytoconstituents in plant crude extracts have been documented to have a synergistic impact on organ/tissue toxicity (Mazunder et al., 2005). Conclusion: The findings of this study support the use of T. occidentalis leaf extracts in traditional medicine for the treatment of anemia and other blood diseases. The findings also imply that T. occidentalis butanol fraction B2b is a safe and powerful hematinic capable of boosting anaemic conditions and therefore might be given as an addition to dietary treatment as well as primary therapy for anemia. However, the consumption of leaf extract of T. occidentalis enhances various hematological parameters such as chlorophyll content, ascorbic acid, and phytochemicals in the leaf extract and therefore improves the physiological and nutritional status of its consumers.
