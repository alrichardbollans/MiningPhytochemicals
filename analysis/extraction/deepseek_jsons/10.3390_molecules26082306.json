The current review discusses the occurrence, distribution, traditional uses, phyto-chemistry, and pharmacological properties of Rhoicissus species covering the period 1981\u20132020. Thedata reported were systematically collected, read, and analysed from scientific electronic databasesincluding Scopus, Scifinder, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. Reported evidence indicates that speciesin this genus are used for the treatment of gastrointestinal complaints, sexually transmitted in-fections (STIs), and infertility, as well as to tone the uterus during pregnancy and to facilitatedelivery. Pharmacological studies have further shown that members of the Rhoicissus genus displayantidiabetic, uterotonic, ascaricidal, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, andanti-inflammatory properties. They are linked to the presence of bioactive compounds isolatedfrom the genus. Hence, Rhoicissus species can potentially be an alternative therapeutic strategy totreat diseases and develop safer and more potent drugs to combat diseases. Plant species of thisgenus have valuable medicinal benefits due to their significant pharmacological potential. However,scientific investigation and information of the therapeutic potential of Rhoicissus remain limited asmost of the species in the genus have not been fully exploited. Therefore, there is a need for furtherinvestigations to exploit the therapeutic potential of the genus Rhoicissus. Future studies shouldevaluate the phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological activities, as well as the mode ofaction, of Rhoicissus crude extracts and secondary compounds isolated from the species.Keywords: botany; cuneifolia; pharmacology; phytochemistry; Rhoicissus; Vitaceae1. IntroductionFor centuries, herbal medicines have been used worldwide to treat and prevent variousailments, particularly in developing countries where infectious diseases are endemic [1\u20133].The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 80% of the world populationuses traditional treatment methods for their primary healthcare system [4\u20136]. This is due tothe increasing costs of conventional treatments, difficult access to modern health facilities,exhaustion of conventional therapies, lack of effective drugs for a serious illness, evolutionof multidrug-resistant microorganisms, belief that natural products are better or safer, andcultural or spiritual preference [1,4\u20138]. This has drawn scientific and research interesttoward naturally derived compounds. These are considered safe, effective, affordable,and biologically friendly, having fewer toxic side-effects than synthetic drugs [2,9\u201311].Furthermore, the interest in natural products has yielded numerous impressive results, in-cluding the discovery of diversely sourced products with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,antihelminthic, antidiabetic, and anticancer activity, leading to pharmaceutical companies\u2019Molecules 2021, 26, 2306. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26082306 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2021, 26, 2306 2 of 22acceptance of natural products as a part of the modern and effective tools for new drugsand new drug leads [11,12].Traditionally, Rhoicissus species are mainly used to enhance fertility and to facilitatedelivery during pregnancy. Decoctions are taken orally to treat impotence and infertility.Women take them in the last trimester of pregnancy to ensure the good health of the motherand fetus by preventing long and complicated labour [13\u201315]. Species from this genusare also used for the treatment of cattle disease, gastrointestinal complaints, and cuts,swollen glands through warming of the roots in fire and pressing them against the glands,diarrhoea, broken bones, cuts, epilepsy, menorrhagia, renal complaints, sprained ankles,stomach ailments, and sores, in addition to as an antiemetic in children and as a generalpain reliever [14,16\u201319].The species from the genus Rhoicissus have also been reported to contain numeroussecondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids which display variousbiological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant activities [14].Phytochemical investigations of Rhoicissus species have revealed the presence of bioactivecompounds responsible for these activities. As a successful example, proanthocyanidinmonomers and dimers, as well as gallic acid, isolated from Rhoicissus tridentata werefound to stimulate smooth muscle contraction in isolated rat uterine tissue [15]. Lupenoneisolated from Rhoicissus species has also been reported to possess antibiotic and antioxidantactivity [15]. However, despite the medicinal application of this genus and the bioactivecompounds isolated and identified from them, there exists no consolidation on previousand latest scientific information on the phytochemistry and biological activities of genusRhoicissus. Hence, the current report presents a comprehensive literature review from 1981to 2020. It includes the botany, geographical distribution, traditional uses, phytochemistry,and pharmacological properties of Rhoicissus species.2. Literature Survey DatabasesThe data reported were systematically collected, read, and analysed from scientificelectronic databases including Scopus, Elsevier, Scifinder, Research gate, ScienceDirect, andGoogle Scholar. Keywords such as Vitaceae, Rhoicissus, and traditional use were submittedduring the search. Additional information on the botany, geographical distribution, tra-ditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of Rhoicissus species wasgathered from references in journal articles, book chapters, books, journal articles, and en-cyclopedias. The information thus obtained was critically analysed to obtain new insightsand possible knowledge gaps for future research opportunities about Rhoicissus species.3. Family VitaceaeVitaceae, also known as the grape family, are a medium-sized plant family with about950 species belonging to 16 genera primarily distributed in the tropics, subtropics, andthe north and south temperate zones [20\u201325]. It is reported that Vitaceae have a largelypantropical distribution in Asia, Africa, Australia, the neotropics, and the Pacific islands,with only a few genera in temperate regions [23,26,27]. The family is well known forcontaining one of the most economically important fruit crops, the grape (Vitis vinifera L.),as the source of wine, sultanas, currants, and raisins [24,26].This known group of flowering plants usually features erect, prostrate, woody climbers,often with swollen or jointed nodes and herbaceous vines, or small succulent trees [21,24,28,29].Vitaceae are readily distinguished from other angiosperm families by their unique seed mor-phology, inflorescences as cyme, corymb, or panicle, and leaf-opposed tendrils, enablingthe family to be the most successful climbers in tropical and temperate forests [23,25,29,30].The stomata apertures in the epidermis are bounded by two guard cells which primarilyallow the rapid movement of carbon dioxide, water vapour, and oxygen in and out of theleaf [29]. The flowers are small, greenish, and inconspicuous, with a ring-like or lobeddisc [28,31].Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 3 of 22According to the phylogenic and morphological evidence, the new classification placesthe 950 species and 16 genera into five tribes: (i) tribe Ampelopsideae J. Wen & Z. L. Nie,trib. nov. (47 species in four genera: Ampelopsis, Nekemias, Rhoicissus, and Clematicissus);(ii) tribe Cisseae Rchb. (300 species in one genus: Cissus); (iii) tribe Cayratiaea J. Wen & L. M.Lu, trib. nov. (370 species in seven genera: Cayratia, Causonis, Afrocayratia, Pseudocayratia,Acareosperma, Cyphostemma, and Tetrastigma); (iv) tribe Parthenocisseae J. Wen & Z. D.Chen, trib. nov (16 species in two genera: Parthenocissus and Yua); (v) tribe Viteae Dumort(190 species in two genera: Ampelocissus and Vitis). The largest genera in this family areCissus L. and Cyphostemma (Planch) [23,25,26,30]. A taxonomy of the Vitaceae family issummarised in Table 1.Table 1.

Genus Rhoicissus4.1. Occurance, Distribution, and Botanical DescriptionThe genus Rhoicissus Planch. is one of the smallest genera in the family [26]. Ap-proximately 12 species represent it, namely, Rhoicissus tridentata, R. digitata, R. rhomboidea,R. tomentosa, R. revoilli, R. sessilifolia, R. microphylla, R. kougabergensis, R. laetans, R. capen-sis, R. erythrodes, and R. sekhukhuniensis, which are endemic to tropical and southernAfrica [26,27,32]. Rhoicissus species are distributed in the Afrotropical zone of Africa, tothe south of the Sahara Desert, in the southern and eastern parts of the Arabian Peninsula,Madagascar, southwestern Pakistan, and the Islands of the Western Indian Ocean [26,30].Rhoicissus species are described as climbing shrubs or woody vines, with tendrilsopposite the leaves and more or less swollen nodes. The leaves are different, simple, orpalmately compound. They are often rusty, with inflorescences borne opposite the leaveswith 5\u20137 merous flowers that are small, greenish, and inconspicuous, with a ring-like orlobed disc. The stamens are equal in number to the petals and opposite to them [31,32]. Theflower buds are globose in outline, while the floral disc is annular, entire, and thick [33].Furthermore, they usually have 5\u20136 fleshy petals per flower. The genus can be distin-guished from other genera of the tribe by its distinctly rugose seeds with linear chalazaand divergent ventral in folds [25]. The summary of phytochemistry, ethnomedicinal andbiological studies reported for Rhoicissus species is illustrated in Table 2.Table 2.

Rhoicissus digitataRhoicissus digitata (L.f.) Gilg & Brandt can grow and reach 15 m in length, is usuallyfound in riparian fringing vegetation, and is reportedly from Natal, Transvaal (South Africa)and Mozambique [34]. This species is a vigorous, evergreen vine, climbing by leaf-opposedtendrils. Leaves are compound, usually trifoliate, although palmate compound leaveswith four or five leaflets are not uncommon. Tendrils and axillary buds are present atevery node and unbranched. Inflorescences are leaf-opposed and cymose, with sparselycompound dichasia on which a small number of flowers are produced. Fruits form in smallclusters; they are green when unripe and turn dark purple when ripe, and they ripen fromSeptember through to December (Figure 1A) [34,35]. It is well known as baboon grape anddune grape (in English), isinwazi (in isiZulu), and vyfvingerdruif (in Afrikaans), and theyare used for medicinal purposes [35].Figure 1. Rhoicissus species: (A) R. digitata; (B) R. laetans; (C) R. microphylla; (D) R. revoilii; (E) R. rhom-boidea; (F) R. tomentosa; (G) R. tridentata.Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 5 of 224.3. Rhoicissus laetansRhoicissus laetans (Turcz.) Gilg & Brandt is a shrub up to 1.5 m high, sometimesscrambling with simple, petiolate leaves and absent tendrils [33]. Its berries are 12 mm indiameter. Classification of this species in the genus Rhoicissus is supported by the shape ofits flower buds, structure of the floral disc, and inflorescence morphology [33]. R. laetans isdistinguished from all the other members of the genus by its shrubby habit and simple,glabrous, glaucous green leaves (Figure 1B) [33]. R. laetans is endemic to the northeasternTransvaal escarpment, where it occurs in a small area. The species is found in mountaingrassland with stunted shrub vegetation or steep, densely wooded kloof slopes with mixedbushveld vegetation. Occasionally, it occurs in riverine forest. The species grows onsoils derived from quartzite and sandstone, and it flowers from at least November tillFebruary [33].4.4. Rhoicissus microphyllaRhoicissus microphylla (Turcz.) Gilg & Brandt is a small shrub which has ovate leaveswith the lamina\u2019s undersurface covered with reddish-brown hairs (Figure 1C). It occurs inthe Eastern Cape, South Africa [33].4.5. Rhoicissus revoiliiRhoicissus revoilii Planch., commonly known as bushveld grape or warty grape, isa woody climber with tendrils about 1\u201310 m in height [18]. It is a shrub, robust woodyclimber, or a creeper in mid- to high-altitude forests, forest margins, bushveld, riverineshrubs, or woodlands [36]. This species has glossy dark green trifoliate leaves with entiremargins, looping lateral veins, and domatia on lateral vein axils of the abaxial surface(Figure 1D). The leaflets are elliptic, and the laterals of this species are asymmetrical,glabrous, or hairy [36]. Their fruits are reddish to black, two-lobed, round in shape andedible [31]. It is distributed in eastern Africa from Ethiopia and Sudan to the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and eastern South Africa (Transvaal,Natal, Swaziland), as well as in Ghana, Comoro Islands, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen [37].4.6. Rhoicissus rhomboideaRhoicissus rhomboidea (E. Mey. ex Harv.) Planch. is a canopy climber that can growand reach 20 m [36]. It is usually referred to as bastard forest grape or rope wood grapeand is distributed in Eastern South Africa (Transvaal, Natal, Swaziland, Cape Province),Mozambique [37]. This species is found in forests, forest margins, and thickets. The leavesare always made up of rhomboid leaflets (asymmetrical rhomboid for lateral leaflets) andalmost always with six dentitions along the margin. It has a globose bud shape with thickspreading petals. The leaflets are shortly stalked, 1\u20134 mm long. It has trifoliate leaves andrusset hairs on both surfaces of the leaflets. The leaves are leathery, glossy, and dark greenon the adaxial surface and without hair when fully grown (Figure 1E) [36].4.7. Rhoicissus tomentosaRhoicissus tomentosa (Lam.) Wild & Drummond is commonly known as an evergreengrape in English, idiliya in Xhosa, and isiNwazi in Zulu, and it is distributed in southernAfrica (Transvaal, Natal, Swaziland, Cape Province) [37]. R. tomentosa can either be ascrambling shrub or a canopy climber that can reach up to 20 m in height. It is foundon the fringes of forests or gaps in closed forests and on riverine bushes [36]. The leavesof R. tomentosa are broadly transversely elliptic to reniform [33]. The leaves have lobesalong the margin, simple in form, and three-nerved at the base. They are dark green onthe adaxial surface and covered with rusty velvet hairs on the abaxial surface (Figure 1F).Rusty velvety hairs are also found covering young stems and tendrils but are later lost onstems as they mature and are replaced by raised dots known as lenticels [36]. Their flowersin dense axillary heads are small and yellowish-green. The fruit is edible, globose, about20 mm in diameter, and red to purplish-black [31].Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 6 of 224.8. Rhoicissus tridentataRhoicissus tridentata is a polymorphic species with numerous nomenclature revisionsover the last two centuries [38]. Originally, this species was divided and classified asseveral species in the genus Rhus. It was later reclassified in the genus Cissus. Later, Wildand Drummond in 1963 combined three different species, R. cuneifolia, R. erythrodes, andR. cirrhiflora and classified them as R. tridentata [20]. Urton then combined five differentspecies in 1986, R. cuneifolia, R. erythrodes, R. cirrhiflora, R. pauciflora, and R. dimidiata, andclassified them as R. tridentata but divided the species into two subspecies, being subspeciestridentata and subspecies cuneifolia [20,38]. Cissus dimidiate was noted as being a mere formof Rhoicissus sericea. They considered R. sericea to be conspecific with the plant namedCissus dimidiata by Ecklon and Zeyher, 1835 and correctly applied the name Rhoicissusdimidiata to them [20].The subspecies are divided according to the number of indentations on the leafletmargins [38]. If the leaflets have no dentations or crenations on the leaflet margins or if thenumber of dentations is four or less, they are classified as subspecies tridentata. If the leaflethas more than four dentations, then it is classified as cuneifolia. The subspecies cuneifoliais more prevalent, having a wider distribution, extending from the Eastern Cape to thenorthern portion of South Africa. In contrast, subspecies tridentata occurs from Riversdaledistrict eastward to Port St Johns and then extends inland in the Southeastern Cape to theKaroo of South Africa [20].R. tridentata (L.f) Wild & Drumm. subsp. cuneifolia (Eckl. & Zehr.), N.R. Urton is adeciduous shrubby creeper in the Vitaceae family. It is commonly known as wild grape(English), isinwazi (Zulu), and umnxeba (isiXhosa) [39]. This subspecies occurs in varioushabitats but is primarily found in forests along forest margins or grows as an erect shrubof up to 2 m or more in open grassy woodlands [20]. R. tridentata has tendrils and cangrow up to 3 m high, spreading up to 1.5 m. The leaves are trifoliate with wedge-shapedleaflets, each having a serrated margin (Figure 1G). The plant bears small inconspicuousyellowish-green flowers followed by small brownish-red berries [39]. Lignotubers rangingin size from 5 to 30 cm in diameter are attached to the roots [20].5. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Rhoicissus SpeciesSpecies of the Rhoicissus genus are widely used in traditional medicines in Africanmedicinal systems to treat various diseased conditions. According to several reports,they are common medicinal herbs used by the Zulus and Xhosas of South Africa. Theyare used to treat cattle diseases, high blood pressure and acute headaches, as well as forblood purification and intestinal cleansing, increasing fertility, relieving menstruation pain,managing helminthiasis and venereal diseases, treating bloody constipation, increasingmilk production in lactating mothers, wound and ringworm healing, anaesthetic properties,and facilitating delivery during pregnancy, among others [14,40\u201343], as summarised inTable 3. However, no particular class of compound has been identified or linked to aparticular medicinal application. Furthermore, even though most of the Rhoicissus speciesare used in African traditional medicine, their prescription, mechanisms and mode ofactions, associated side-effects, and/or proven efficacy are not clear. A more detailed studyis needed to establish their mode of action, side-effects, and safety.Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 7 of 22Table 3.

Biological Studies of Rhoicissus Species6.1. Anti-Inflammatory ActivityThe research reported on the anti-inflammatory potential of methanolic extracts ofR. digitata (leaf), R. romboidea (root), R. tomentosa (leaf/stem), and R. tridentata (root) indi-cated significant inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1) [59,60]. COX-1 is a prostaglandin-producing enzyme that promotes inflammation, pain, and fever, activates platelets, and pro-tects the stomach and intestinal lining. An ethanol indomethacin standard solution (20 \u00b5Min the assay) was assayed together with the samples (13.3 mg for each sample residue) toverify the sensitivity of the assay [59]. The extracts of R. digitata and R. rhomboidea exhibitedthe highest inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with 53% and 56% inhibition, respectively,compared to 89% inhibition by the indomethacin standard, suggesting their potential to beused as anti-inflammatory agents [59,60]. It was reported that none of the aqueous extractsshowed any significant anti-inflammatory activity [59]. Furthermore, R. tridentata wasinvestigated with the anti-inflammatory enzyme 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX). The enzyme(15-LOX) was made up to a final concentration of 200 units/mL in 2 M borate buffer(pH 9), and a volume of 12.5 \u00b5L of each plant sample and control was added to 487.5 \u00b5Lof 15-LOX [52]. R. tridentata showed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of87.39 \u00b5g/mL against the 15-LOX enzyme [52]. The results suggested that members of thegenus Rhoicissus have the potential to be used as anti-inflammatory agents.Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 9 of 226.2. Antimicrobial ActivityThe antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganismsof the methanolic extracts of R. digitata, R. rhomboidea, R. tomentosa, and R. tridentata were in-vestigated [59]. Standard antibiotics, penicillin G (10 IU\u00b7disc\u22121), tetracycline (30 \u00b5g\u00b7disc\u22121),and chloramphenicol (30 \u00b5g\u00b7disc\u22121), were used to eliminate variations between plates [59].It was found that all extracts showed some degree of antimicrobial activity, with R. rhom-boidea (root) demonstrating the highest inhibitory activity against different microorganisms.The crude methanolic extracts of R. tridentata and R. digitata mainly inhibited Gram-positiveand Gram-negative microorganisms. Most of the extracts showed insufficient inhibitoryactivity towards Salmonella sp. including S. Typhimurium and Shigella sp. (S. boydii andS. flexneri). None of the extracts inhibited Escherichia coli or showed activity against S.flexneri. R. digitata (leaf) extract indicated a >10.00 mm inhibition zone diameter againstS. boydii compared to the standard chloramphenicol that showed a 7.00 mm inhibitionzone diameter. Tetracycline showed no activity against S. boydii [59] as a standard. R.rhomboidei stem extract and the standards chloramphenicol and tetracycline all indicated a>10.00 mm inhibition zone diameter against Salmonella sp. [59]. It was also reported that theplant extracts inhibited the Gram-positive microorganisms more than the Gram-negativeones [59].The antifungal activity of Rhoicissus species was tested using Candida albicans andSaccharomyces cerevisiae [59]. Methanolic extracts of R. digitata (leaf) and R. romboidea (root)exhibited the highest antifungal activity against C. albicans with an inhibition zone diameterof >10.00 mm. A methanol extract of R. tridentata exhibited antifungal activity against C.albicans with an inhibition zone diameter of 7.00 mm [59].A study conducted to screen 14 medicinal plants used by the Venda communityfor infectious diseases supported the antibacterial activities of the methanol extracts ofthe roots and tubers of R. tridentata [61]. Experiments were conducted using 10 \u00b5L of a50 mg/mL gentamycin solution as a positive control and 15 \u00b5L (6%) of dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO) as a negative control [61]. The extracts of R. tridentata showed activities againstall the organisms tested with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varying from0.75 mg/mL against Bacillus cereus to 6.00 mg/mL against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobactercloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of gentamycinwas 0.008 mg/mL against most of the organisms tested and 0.017 mg/mL for P. aeruginosaand Serratia marcescens [61]. Fruit extracts were not as active as the underground parts andexhibited MICs of more than 12.00 mg/mL [61].Antimicrobial properties of the methanol root and leaf extracts of R. revoilli were alsostudied. The extracts were active against three microorganisms: Gram-positive Streptococcuspyogenes, Gram-negative Salmonella typhi, and the fungal pathogen Aspergillus niger [47].First, 3 g of the filtered and dried plant extract was constituted with 10 mL of 100%cyclohexane to prepare a stock solution. The control had cyclohexane alone without anyextract to cancel the effect of the solvent on the test organisms [47]. The growth inhibitiondiameter was 4.68 mm for S. pyogenes, 5.08 mm for S. typhi, and 4.27 mm for A. niger.The root extract showed more significant microbial growth inhibition in comparison toleaf extracts [47]. R. revoilli also displayed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureusat high dilution levels with a 9.00 mm inhibition zone diameter and showed minimalinhibitory activity against Escherichia coli (8.00 mm inhibition zone diameter) [62]. Thestandard, Dettol, showed higher inhibitory activity against E. coli (20.00 mm inhibitionzone diameter) but only at low dilution levels, and inhibitory activity against S. aureus waslower than in the case of E. coli with a 12.00 mm inhibition zone diameter [62]. The ethanolextract of R. revoilii rhizomes displayed inhibition zone diameters of 12.82 mm against E.coli and 17.50 mm against C. albicans [63]. Standard concentrations of 0.12 mg/mL nystatinand 0.3 mg/mL chloramphenicol were used as positive controls. About 500 mg of theethanol extract was triturated with 1 mL of DMSO and then made up to 5 mL in distilledwater to give a test solution of 100 \u00b5g/\u00b5L concentration for each fraction [63]. These resultssupport the traditional antimicrobial use of R. revoilli.Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 10 of 22Different medicinal plants were tested for antifungal activities against five Fusariumspecies using the whole-plate diffusion method [64]. Sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)was used as a negative control, and nystatin was used as a positive control [64]. Themethanol extract (roots) of R. tridentata was active against Fusarium graminearum with aninhibition zone diameter of 15.00 mm compared to an inhibition zone diameter of 20.00 mmfor nystatin [64]. The acetone extract (tubers) showed high activities with MIC valuesranging between 0.95 and 3.75 mg/mL against the five Fusarium species tested [64].Methanol/chloroform (50/50, v/v) and ethyl acetate (100%) extracts of the rhizomes ofR. tomentosa were tested against 14 bacterial strains using the disc diffusion and microdilu-tion assay methods [46]. Bacteria most susceptible to rhizome extracts were Staphylococcusaureus (MIC of 0.06 mg/mL) and Bacillus subtilis (MIC of 0.13 mg/mL) [46]. The resultsshowed that the rhizome extracts of R. tomentosa have good antibacterial activity againstGram-positive organisms such as S. aureus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis (2.00 mg/mL),Mycobacterium smegmatis (0.06 mg/mL), Bacillus cereus (0.50 mg/mL), and Staphylococcusepidermidis (2.00 mg/mL). In contrast, only the Gram-negative organisms Proteus vulgaris(8.00 mg/mL) and Proteus mirabilis (16.00 mg/mL) displayed sensitivity to the extracts [46].Extracts of selected plant species used to treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) insouthern Africa were investigated for antimicrobial properties and anti-human immunode-ficiency virus (HIV) activity against the recombinant HIV-1 enzyme [52]. Doxorubicin at100 \u00b5g/mL was used as the positive control. For the negative control, only the lysis bufferand reaction mixture were added [52]. R. tridentata demonstrated the best antimicrobialactivity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae with the lowest MIC value of 0.40 mg/mL. C. albicansand Gardnerella vaginalis had MIC values of 0.80 mg/mL and Oligella ureolytica had an MICvalue of 1.60 mg/mL [52]. R. tridentata also had the best HIV-1 RT inhibition activity of75.50% compared to that of the positive control doxorubicin (96.50%) at 100.00 \u00b5g/mL [52].The observed activities may lead to new multitarget drugs against STIs.R. tridentata (ethanol extract) also displayed activity against C. albicans, E. coli, andS. aureus with an MIC of 0.80 mg/mL compared to the positive control ciprofloxacin withan MIC of 0.1 mg/mL [65].In a related study, traditional medicinal plants used in South Africa to treat urinarytract infections caused by microorganisms were investigated [66]. Ciprofloxacin was usedas the positive control at a final concentration of 0.063 mg/mL, while 100 \u00b5L of 1.0% DMSO(instead of plant extract) was used as the negative control [66]. The methanol extractof R. tridentata displayed the highest activity against Serratia marcescens with an MIC of0.13 mg/mL [66]. The positive control ciprofloxacin presented an MIC of <0.063 mg/mL.The polar extracts of R. tridentata were able to reduce the initial cell attachment of S.aureus, P. mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens by approximately 50% [66]. The quantitative anti-quorum sensing assay indicated that the methanol extract of R. tridentata inhibited violaceinproduction by C. violaceum by more than 50%, with an IC50 of 2.58 mg/mL [66]. The positivecontrol eugenol was 1.73 mg/mL [66]. The results validate the use of R. tridentata to treaturinary tract infections (UTIs) and indicate that this plant may be a suitable source ofantipathogenic drugs to treat UTIs [66].6.3. Antiproliferative ActivityAqueous and methanol extracts of R. digitata, R. rhomboidea, R. tomentosa, and R.tridentata were screened to determine their therapeutic potentials as anticancer agents [14].The antiproliferative activity in vitro against HepG2 cells, a human liver cancer cell line,was determined. The aqueous root extract of R. tridentata subsp. cuneifolia displayed thehighest antiproliferative activity, with a 96.27% inhibition of proliferation compared withthe other crude plant extracts [14]. The methanol extract of R. tridentata also presented amore potent inhibition of 87.01%. The crude root extract of R. tomentosa exhibited 70.40%inhibition of proliferation [14]. The results from this study demonstrated that all theRhoicissus species screened have potential antineoplastic activity against the HepG2 cellMolecules 2021, 26, 2306 11 of 22line, and the root extracts demonstrated stronger inhibitory activities compared with theleaf and stem extracts [14].6.4. Antioxidant ActivityThe antioxidant activity of R. tridentata was 0.06 \u00b5g/mL, lower than that of vitamin C(IC50 of 1.44 \u00b5g/mL) [65]. In this study, 2 mg plant samples were tested at concentrationsranging from 500\u20133.91 \u00b5g/mL. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was used as a positive control,and ethanol was used as a solvent control (blank) [65].Methanol extracts of the roots, stems, and leaves of four Rhoicissus species (R. digitate,R. rhomboidea, R. tomentosa, and R. tridentata) were tested for antioxidant activity [67].Commercial antioxidants vitamin E, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and hydroxyanisole(BHA) were used as standards [67]. The extracts of R. rhomboidea and R. tridentata revealedmore than 50% antioxidant activity compared with values obtained for the commercialantioxidants. The commercial antioxidants gave the following results vitamin E, 63%;butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 50.10%; butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), 42.50% [67]. R.rhomboidea and R. tridentata inhibited the 1, 1\u2032-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical withapproximately 98% radical scavenging activity. Xanthine oxidase was inhibited by 88.20%by the root extract of R. rhomboidei. The stem of R. tridentata exhibited an inhibitory effectabove 70% against xanthine oxidase. It also prevented the production of thiobarbituricacid-reactive substances and free radical-mediated DNA sugar damage (catechin showedan 85.40% inhibitory effect) [67].The four Rhoicissus extracts had a strong chelating effect on Fe2+ ions, especially theleaves of R. tridentata [67]. R. digitata and R. tomentosa extracts possessed pro-oxidativeproperties at high concentrations (2.50 mg/100 mL) due to the presence of the plantphenolics [67]. The results indicate that the four Rhoicissus species have a protective actionagainst the overproduction of free radicals. One of the mechanisms of action suggeststhat R. rhomboidea and R. tridentata contain compounds (polyphenols) with strong radical-scavenging and antiradical-generating effects.6.5. Uterotonic ActivityPharmacological investigation of crude aqueous extracts of R. tridentata roots dis-played direct contractile responses in isolated rat uterus and ileum [68]. The muscarinicreceptor system and the produced cyclooxygenase metabolites facilitated the contractileresponse to the extract [68]. The results provide evidence justifying the ethnomedical useof this plant to promote quick and uncomplicated labour. The potential exists for the plantdecoctions to cause birth complications caused by increased uterine contractility [68]. Itwas also confirmed that the contractile activity of R. tridentata extracts varies seasonallyto different plant parts [51]. The activity of the plant extracts from plants harvested insummer and autumn were 4\u20135-fold higher than extracts from plants harvested in winter orspring. The lignotubers stimulated the most significant number of contractions, followedby the stems, roots, and leaves [51].Aqueous extracts of the roots of R. tridentata revealed notable in vitro activity onisolated rat uterine smooth muscle tissue [15]. Extracts with the highest activity alsocontained proanthocyanidin monomers, dimers, gallic acid, and 74% polymeric proantho-cyanidins [15]. Glucose and a hydrogel of glucose extracted from the methanol root extractalso greatly stimulated uterine muscle contraction [15]. \u03b2-Sitosterol and its glucoside,sitosterolin, exhibited only slight oestrogenic activity, increasing the response of the uterusby about 2% at concentrations of acetylcholine below 10\u22127 M and 10\u22125 M, respectively, andinhibiting this response at higher acetylcholine concentrations [15].Furthermore, the chloroform and ethanol extracts of the root bark of R. tridentata wereinvestigated for their in vitro activity on the contraction of corpus cavernosum smoothmuscle of white New Zealand rabbits [56]. The extracts stimulated dose-dependentrelaxation in the muscle at concentrations of 13.00 and 6.50 mg/mL [56]. At an ex-tract concentration of 13.00 mg/mL, the relaxation induced was significantly higherMolecules 2021, 26, 2306 12 of 22(p < 0.01, 30.70 \u00b1 3.3 chloroform extract and 43.00 \u00b1 9.4 ethanol extract) than that seenwith 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 mg/mL of the positive control Viagra [56]. This study indicated that R.tridentata is a promising candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.6.6. CytotoxicityThe ethanol extract of R. tridentata showed moderate toxicity with a half maximaleffective concentration (EC50) of 88.50 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5g/mL, whereas actinomycin D exhibitedan IC50 value of 0.00932 \u00b5g/mL [65]. Actinomycin D ranging from 400\u20133.13 and 0.013 to0.0001 \u00b5g/mL was used as a positive control for the cytotoxicity assay. The toxicity effectsof the samples were determined using 50 \u00b5L of XTT reagent (1 mg/mL 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) with 0.383 mg/mL N-methyldibenzopyrazine methyl sulphate (PMS)) [65].The cytotoxicity of the aqueous extracts from R. tridentata was studied using monkeyVero cells and human fibroblasts [50]. The threshold for zero cell deaths was 8.00 \u00b5g/mL formonkey Vero cells. At this concentration, 100% of human fibroblast cells also survived [50].The estimated concentration in the bloodstream was 6.10 \u00b5g/mL, taking dilutions intoaccount. It was then concluded that R. tridentata is not toxic at a cellular level since theestimated cell concentrations were below the thresholds for zero cell death for monkey Verocells, which is 8.00 \u00b5g/mL [50]. The nontoxic nature of this species was also demonstratedusing human hepatoma, kidney epithelial, histiocytoma, and mouse Leydig cells [15].6.7. Hepatoprotective ActivityThe identity of catechins and the in vitro antioxidative properties of R. tridentatamotivated a study to investigate the in vivo hepatoprotective effects of R. tridentata againstCCl4-induced acute liver injury in rats [53,55,67]. The variables investigated were thealanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASP), glucose-6-phosphatase(G-6-Pase), and lipid peroxide (LPO) levels of liver homogenates. Liver microsomalfractions were investigated as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels [53]. The results displayed adecrease in the concentration of ALT, ASP, and LPO (p < 0.05) after the administration ofthe plant extract to the CCl4-intoxicated rats. In contrast, the G-6-Pase concentration waselevated (p < 0.05) in the plant extract-treated rats, and this shows that R. tridentata hascomponents with hepatoprotective properties [53].6.8. Ascaricidal ActivityThe in vitro anthelmintic activity of the extracts of R. tridentata was tested, and themedian effective dose (ED50) values of the extracts were determined using the Ascarismodel [54]. The ED50 of R. tridentata was found to be 4.36 mg/mL [54]. The highest dose of10.00 mg/mL first showed activity at 12 h, achieving a maximum response of 100% at 24 h.Doses of 4.00, 6.00, and 8.00 mg/mL first showed activity at 12 h. The maximum responsewas achieved at 48 h for doses of 4.00 and 6.00 mg/mL. After 36 h, the maximum responsewas achieved for 8.00 mg/mL. The lowest dose of 2.00 mg/mL started a response at 24 hand only achieved a 90% response at 48 h [54]. These results show that R. tridentata can beused for the treatment of helminth diseases in cattle.A study to determine in vitro ascaricidal activity of ethanolic and water extract of root-tuber R. tridentata against adult nematodes was conducted [69]. The in vitro adult motilityinhibition assay revealed that the two extracts exhibited motility inhibition, and the ethano-lic extract was more potent [69]. The ascaricidal single-dose effect increased with increasingconcentration of the extract. The highest concentrations of 64.00 and 128.00 mg/mL forethanol and water extracts gave a maximum mean percentage ascaricidal activity by 48 h as80.00 \u00b1 10.0% and 90.00 \u00b1 0.6%, respectively [69]. The crude extract\u2019s potential to controlgastrointestinal nematodes was indicated by the low ED50 of 25.00 mg/mL [69].Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 13 of 226.9. Antidiabetic ActivityA study was designed to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of aqueous leaf extracts ofR. tridentata in alloxan-induced diabetic mice [19]. The aqueous leaf extracts showed antidi-abetic activity. Intraperitoneally and orally administered aqueous whole-stem extracts of R.tridentata decreased the blood glucose levels at all four doses of 50.00, 100.00, 200.00, and300.00 mg/kg body weight, from the first hour to the sixth hour in a dose-independentmanner [19]. The intraperitoneal route of herbal extract administration was more effectivethan the oral route [19].7. Phytochemistry of Some Species of the Rhoicissus GenusThe study of chemical compounds found in plants is essential for drug discoveryand for developing novel therapeutic agents against significant diseases as they are bi-ologically active. Different species of the Rhoicissus genus have been shown to possessbioactive compounds such as coumarins, flavonoids, phytosterols, essential oils, saponins,terpenoids, alkaloids, reducing sugars, and tannins, which are the reason for their usein traditional medicine. The phytochemical screening carried out on the rhizomes of R.tomentosa revealed the presence of many known groups of bioactive compounds: alkaloids,flavonoids, saponins, steroids, reducing sugars, and tannins [46].While there have been many investigations on the pharmacological activities of thisgenus, little has been achieved concerning the isolation and identification of bioactivecompounds. It is established that few chemical constituents have been isolated from thesespecies within the review period, as most of the chemical constituents have been profiledfrom the crude extracts. This limits further studies aimed at advancing the bioactiveconstituents to clinical trials.Among the identified compounds, essential oils and other phenolic acids (1\u201314) werepredominant. Other compounds included triterpenoids such as 12,13-dehydrolupeol(21), 3\u03b2-taraxerol (23), and stigmasterol (24), as well as flavonoids such as quercetin (22),quercetrin (25), and aromadendrin-7-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside (26), among others, as illus-trated in Tables 4 and 5 and Figures 2\u20134.Table 4.

Chemical structures of acids isolated from the genus Rhoicissus.Organic acids (malic (15), succinic (16), and fumaric acids (17)) (Figure 2) were alsodetected in the free phenolic fraction and malonoic and propanoic acids were detectedin the hydrolysable fraction of R. tridentata [17]. Homovanillyl alcohol was found in thefree phenolic fraction, and gallic (18), vanillic (19), and ferulic acids (20) (Figure 2) wereconfirmed in the bound phenolic fraction [17]. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemicalscreening of the aqueous leaf extracts of R. tridentata also indicated the presence of phenols,alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins [19]. R. tridentata is known to contain ahigh concentration of polyphenolic compounds [55,67]. The phytochemical screening ofR. revoilli revealed active compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, steroids,and anthraquinones. Aldehydes were detected in the leaf extract [47]. However, thesecompounds were not structurally elucidated.Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 15 of 22Figure 3.

Structures of proanthocyanidin monomers and dimers from genus Rhoicissus.A phytochemical investigation of the roots and fruits of R. digitata led to the isolationof triterpenes and flavonoids [44]. From the roots, leaves, and fruits of R. tomentosa,terpenoids, flavonoids, an alkaloid, and a carotenoid were isolated, as illustrated in Table 5and Figure 3 [44]. Moreover, the leaf extracts of R. tomentosa tested positive for coumarins,flavonoids, phytosterols, essential oils, saponins, terpenoids, and resveratrol, and thehexane and ethyl acetate/hexane (1:4) extracts of R. tomentosa were submitted for GC\u2013MSanalysis [83].Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 17 of 22Table 5.

The proanthocyanidin monomers and dimers from the methanol rootextract were identified as follows using HPLC: catechin (34), gallocatechin (35), fisetinidol(36) mollisacacidin (37), epicatechin (38), epigallocatechin (39), epicatechin-3-O-gallate (40),Molecules 2021, 26, 2306 18 of 22procyanidin B3 (41), procyanidin B4 (42), fisetinidol (4\u03b1-8) (43), fisetinidol (4\u03b2-8), catechin(44) (Figure 4), andgallic acid (18) (Figure 2).Glucose and a partially identified hydrogel of glucose were also isolated from themethanol root extract. Oleanolic acid (31) was isolated from a chloroform extract. Thenonpolar fraction yielded two further triterpenoids, 20(29)-lupen-3-one (29) and 20-epi-\u03c8-taraxastananol (30), as well as \u03b3-sitosterol (33), which were identified by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (Figure 3). From the extract of branches, the plant growth hormonetriacontanol was purified [15].Most of the isolated compounds have documented health-promoting properties. Itsupports their use by traditional healers to promote good health during pregnancy. Proan-thocyanidins are potent antioxidants beneficial for the heart, cardiovascular, and immunesystems (Figure 4). Lupenone (29) has antibiotic and antioxidant activity [93]. Triacon-tanol has cholesterol-lowering properties, and the triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid(31), lupenone (29), and taraxastananol (30) are well known for their anti-inflammatoryproperties [15,94].8. ConclusionsR. tridentata is used to treat various ailments including erectile dysfunction, pains,swelling, cuts, wounds, kidney and bladder complications, stomach ailments, and livestockdiseases, as well as for gynaecological purposes. Compounds isolated from R. tridentatainclude proanthocyanidin monomers and dimers, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins,saponins, organic acids, and triterpenoids. Pharmacological studies indicated that Rhoicis-sus species exhibited antitumor, antispasmodic, antipruritic, anaesthetic, neuroprotective,analgesic, antipyretic, antidepressant, antiepileptic, anthelmintic, antiasthmatic, antidi-abetic, uterotonic, ascaricidal, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antioxidant,antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. These results areencouraging and indicate that Rhoicissus is an essential source of many pharmacologicallyand medicinally important compounds. Hence, this plant has the potential as an alternativetherapeutic strategy to treat diseases and can be used as part of a template for developingsafer and powerful drugs to combat diseases. The observed biological activities of the mem-bers of Rhoicissus support the medicinal use of these plants by traditional healers. However,no specific compound class has been identified or linked to a particular ethnomedicinal ap-plication of these species. Their prescription, mechanisms, associated side-effects, and/orproven efficacy are also not clear. Thus, there is a need for more detailed studies to establishthe missing information.While many investigations into the pharmacological activities of the genus Rhoicissushave been done, little has been achieved concerning the isolation and identification ofbioactive compounds. Only a few chemical constituents have been isolated from thesespecies within the review period. This limits further studies aimed at advancing thebioactive constituents to clinical trials. Studies focusing on the biological activities ofRhoicissus have been conducted in vitro, and little data are available on the biologicalactivities of compounds isolated from the species. There is a need for further studiesfocusing on the phytochemistry, pharmacological, and toxicological properties, as well asin vivo studies involving the crude extracts and chemical compounds isolated from thespecies. New techniques such as high-throughput screening, molecular docking studies,and metabolomics should be advanced, especially for complex plant matrices.Author Contributions: N.P.D. conceptualised, read, reviewed, and wrote the original draft of themanuscript; X.S.-N., R.W.M.K., D.K., V.J.T. and A.-L.M. read, reviewed, corrected, and providedinsights into the occurrence, distribution, traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacologicalproperties of Rhoicissus species.
