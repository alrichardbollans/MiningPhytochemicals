Apr. 2019Sustenance, nourishment,and cultivation: plants as livingcultural heritage for dispersedChagossians in Mauritius,Seychelles, and the UKLaura Jeffery University of EdinburghRebecca Rotter University of EdinburghApplying a critical heritage studies approach to plants, this article explores how plant knowledge anduse, plant exchange, and plant symbolism and materiality feature in the social life of the dispersedChagossian community in Mauritius, Seychelles, and the UK. First, plant use helps to sustain collectiveknowledge in new environmental conditions and social settings. Second, plant exchange nourisheskinship and other social relationships within the extended community. Third, plant symbolism andmateriality cultivate nostalgic links to idealized homelands in the context of community dispersal.Nevertheless, the capacity of plants to contribute to these social processes is limited by challenges tointergenerational knowledge transmission across time and space, and by environmental, financial, andregulatory constraints on plant migration. The article argues that for the displaced Chagossiancommunity, plants are living cultural heritage with social potential (albeit constrained) in the contextof dislocation and loss, ongoing suffering, and geographical dispersal.From ethnobotany to plants as living cultural heritageEthnobotanical studies of relationships between people and plants record plantknowledge and use in communities around the world, often focusing on the medicinaland nutritive properties and uses of plants (see Bennett & Prance 2000; Haselmair,Pirker, Kuhn & Vogl 2014; Ladio 2001; Pirker, Haselmair, Kuhn, Schunko & Vogl 2012;Reyes-Garcia et al. 2013; Smith-Hall, Larsen & Pouliot 2012). Such studies catalogue theplant species used by a particular group of people, detail the uses to which they are put,identify categories of users, note changes in pharmacopoeias and their causes, or reportprocesses of botanical knowledge transmission. In other words, they conceive of plantsprincipally as material resources with particular physical and phytochemical propertieswhich are utilized by people for practical purposes. The anthropological record atteststo a variety of additional material, sensory, and symbolic relationships between peopleJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, whichpermits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properlycited.2 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca Rotterand plants, and anthropologists have criticized those ethnobotanical accounts whichdecontextualize local knowledge (Ellen 2006: S10; Hsu 2010: 1). Additionally, theethnobotanical literature has often evinced what Clifford (2008) termed the \u2018salvageparadigm\u2019: endeavours to record and preserve knowledge and practices (and plantspecies) perceived to be threatened by destructive historical (or biological or cultural ortechnological) forces (Ellen 2006: S2). This ismost clearly reflected inNazarea\u2019s proposalfor \u2018memory banking\u2019: \u2018the collection and documentation of indigenous knowledgeand technologies, including uses, preferences and evaluation criteria associated withtraditional varieties of crops\u2019 (1996: 1). The argument goes that just as the geneticinformation coded inplant germplasmcanbe stored in seedbanks, cultural informationpossessedby elderly cultivators is an important formofheritage that shouldbepreservedfor posterity, and as part of efforts to maintain biodiversity. Even ethnobotanists whoacknowledge the symbolic importance of plants tend to view botanical resources andknowledge through the salvage paradigm.The heritagemovement, rooted in amodern concern to document andpreserve sites,monuments, cultural objects, and memories (Harrison 2013), traditionally also sharedthis salvage paradigm, as reflected in the principles of international organizations suchas UNESCO (2012). As Rowlands and De Jong (2007: 17) argue, heritage spaces such asthe heritage site, the museum, and the archive are perceived as symbols of modernity,providing a sense of permanence to counter loss, rupture, and displacement. In otherwords, heritage practices often attempt to fix objects, practices, meanings and identitiesin place, and to safeguard against erosion from the passage of time. However, heritagescholars are increasingly engagedwith critiques of the salvage paradigm, and their focushas shifted from tangible objects to the intangible processes enabling (or precluding)their production (Bortolotti 2007). Critical heritage studies sees heritage as a resourcewhich subaltern people can use to define themselves, display their group membership,and assert geographical belonging (Smith 2006). It contends that heritage is a processof selecting and privileging certain memories and memorial artefacts for preservation,and repressing and rejecting others (Rowlands &De Jong 2007: 16), which allows peopleto rework the meanings of the past according to the demands of the present (Smith2006: 4, 49). As Smith (2006: 3) points out, tangible elements such as places and objectsare heritage not because they have inherent value, but because of the intangible socialprocesses and activities that take place at, around and through them, of which theybecome a part.In this article, we examine the meanings ascribed to plants, botanical knowledge,and plant use through a critical heritage lens. Our goal is neither to fix nor to preservebotanical knowledge, but rather to examine what plants can do for people who haveexperienced forced displacement from their homeland, a loss of tangible heritage, anddisrupted social ties. We do this by exploring the social life of plants amongmembers ofthe dispersed Chagossian community living inMauritius, Seychelles, and the UK. First,we look at the plant knowledge that migrants carry with them and how they sustaincollective knowledge and adapt plant use in response to new environmental conditions.Second, we consider how plant exchange can nourish social relationships with familyand others in the dispersed community. Third, we examine how plant symbolism andmateriality can cultivate nostalgic links to an idealized homeland in the context ofcommunity dispersal.1 We also touch upon two limitations on the capacity for plantsto fulfil these roles: firstly the challenges of transmitting knowledge to the youngergenerations who have been born outwith the homeland, and secondly environmentalJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 3and regulatory constraints on plant migration. Our argument is that for the displacedcommunity in question, plants are living cultural heritage \u2013 in the sense that heritageis a process \u2013 with social potential in the context of displacement and loss, ongoingsuffering, and geographical dispersal.The Chagos Archipelago: migrating people and plantsThe Chagos islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean were unpopulated byhumans prior to European colonial expansion in the region from the late eighteenthcentury onwards, when French planters brought enslaved labourers mostly frommainland East Africa and Madagascar via Mauritius. The Chagos Archipelago wasadministered as a dependency of colonial Mauritius. The Colony of Mauritius andits dependencies \u2013 including Chagos and Seychelles \u2013 were transferred to Britishcontrol during the Napoleonic Wars; Seychelles became a separate crown colony in1903. Throughout the settled history of the Chagos islands, coconut plantations werethe economic base and main source of employment. Also known as the Oil Islands,they relied almost entirely on the production of copra (dried coconut flesh) exportedfor the extraction of coconut oil that was refined for energy and used in the productionof soap (among other products) inMauritius and beyond. Chagos islanders working inthe plantations received rations of coconut products and imported staples such as rice,lentils, maize, and salt; they also consumed local fish, crustaceans, green sea turtles,seabirds, wildfowl, poultry, pigs, and fruit and vegetables grown in their own kitchengardens (Jeffery 2013: 306-7; LeChartier 1991: 96-9). Islanders grew awide range of edibleplants, including cabbage; many varieties of greens; sweet potato; plantain; breadfruit;manioc; yam; bilimbi; maize; tomato and aubergine; pumpkin and courgette; bittergourd, snake gourd, and bottle gourd; pepper and chilli; lemon and lime; Seville orangeand grapefruit; Malay rose apple, custard apple, and monkey\u2019s apple; mango; melonand watermelon; pineapple; papaya; guava; soursop; and seven varieties of banana. Thesandy soil lacked sufficient topsoil for carrots and potatoes (but cf. Bourne 1886: 387;Moresby & Elwon 1841: 259).In his monograph Limuria, Robert Scott, then the British Governor of Mauritius,noted that the islands had an uncertain future owing to the rise of vegetable oils, whichwere more accessible and cheaper than coconut oil (1961: 291-3), although it turnedout that this was not the only threat. In 1965, the UK government excised Chagosfrom Mauritius to form part of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) beforegranting independence to Mauritius in 1968 and to Seychelles in 1976. In 1966 the UKgovernment made the Chagos Archipelago available for the defence purposes of theUK and US, and since 1971 the largest Chagos island of Diego Garcia has been the siteof a major US overseas military base. Successive Mauritian governments have claimedsovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago since 1980, but the UK\u2019s response is that Chagoswill be returned toMauritian sovereignty only when it is no longer required for defencepurposes. Between 1965 and 1973 the UK government depopulated the archipelago; overthis period as a whole, between 1,328 and 1,522 islanders ended up inMauritius, and 232in Seychelles (Gifford & Dunne 2014: 46).Since their displacement, Chagossian groups have campaigned for adequatecompensation and the right of return to Chagos. The UK government awarded limitedcompensation toChagos islanders (bornon theChagosArchipelago) living inMauritius(but not Seychelles) in 1972 and in 1982, when the compensation package includedmoney and the option to receive land (contributed by the Mauritian government)Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 20164 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca Rotterand/or small houses on purpose-built housing estates. Islanders born on Chagos andmost of their second-generation descendants were awarded UK citizenship under theBritish Overseas Territories Act in 2002, but spouses and subsequent generations ofdescendants are not automatically eligible for UK citizenship. Over two thousandpeople from the extended Chagossian community are estimated to have moved to theUK, where they live in the largest concentrations in Crawley (West Sussex),Manchester,and Greater London, although by far the largest concentration, totalling around sevenhundred surviving Chagos islanders and several thousand of their descendants, still livein Mauritius. A series of court cases brought on behalf of the Chagossian communityfailed to establish their right of return to Chagos. In 2014, the UK governmentcommissioned a resettlement feasibility study while simultaneously defending the no-fishing Marine Protected Area (MPA) established around the Chagos Archipelago in2010, which is being contested both by Chagossians and by the Mauritian government.In 2015, an Arbitral Tribunal at the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitrationfound unanimously that the declaration of the MPA was incompatible with the UKgovernment\u2019s obligations to Mauritius under the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court in London is expected to deliver itsverdict on an application for judicial review of the MPA in early 2016.This article draws principally on research conducted since 2011 as part of a project ondebates about environmental knowledge concerning the Chagos Archipelago, althoughit also draws on relevant material from ethnographic fieldwork conducted since2002 with the extended Chagossian community, which comprises displaced Chagosislanders and their descendants born outwith Chagos. During ethnographic fieldworkin Mauritius and the UK, we visited Chagossians\u2019 kitchen gardens, went food shoppingwith them,prepared andate food together, and received treatment forminor ailments bycommunity healers deploying traditional remedies. As part of a specific focus on plants,we asked about the use of edible and medicinal plants in Chagos, Mauritius, Seychelles,and the UK, including recollections of environmental changes and changing practices.In some interviews we also deployed two illustrated guides to edible and medicinalplants of the Indian Ocean (Gurib-Fakim 2007; 2009) as an elicitation device. Thephotographs therein frequently helped our respondents to identify more species, but asa corollary the material generated during these conversations was perhaps less detailedbecause respondents were keen to turn pages quickly to see what was next, whereasduring conversations without visual aids they dwelt on fewer species in more depth.Respondents\u2019 enthusiasm for discussing plants was striking: Chagos islanders\u2019 faces litup when we explained that we were interested to learn about the plants they used onChagos, and some interviews lasted several hours. Conversations about plants enabledpeople to explorememories of the physical character of the islands and everyday aspectsof life, and to assert their authority by conveying specialized and extensive knowledge.Each of our Chagossian interviewees identified several dozen plants that they eitherused themselves or knew that other people had used as a raw material in a wide rangeof domestic and economic activities: as medicine, food, fuel, and animal feed; to maketools and handicrafts; and to build houses and boats.Medicinal plant use in the sustenance of collective knowledge amongstmigrantsAnthropologists have devoted considerable attention over the past two decades tothe ethical, ideological, methodological, and terminological challenges in attemptingJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 5to distinguish indigenous knowledge (IK) or traditional ecological or environmentalknowledge (TEK) from \u2018scientific\u2019 or \u2018biomedical\u2019 knowledge (see, e.g., Dove 2006: 195-6; Ellen, Parkes&Bicker 2000; Lauer&Aswani 2009; Nazarea 2006: 321-3; Sillitoe, Bicker& Pottier 2002). Our intention is neither to recap nor to revisit these debates, but ratherto consider how plants feature in migrants\u2019 attempts to sustain, transmit, and adapttheir collective knowledge in the context of geographical dispersal from the homeland.As several contributors to an edited volume on the topic (Pieroni & Vandebroek 2007)have reported, migrants often continue to use traditional healthcare strategies to treatminor ailments, but tend to use a smaller number of plants and herbs in their newsocieties than they used in their home societies, and are sometimes constrained intheir use of certain species owing to the space limitations of urban living, unfavourablegrowing conditions, legislation against importation, or the unavailability, high cost, orpoor quality of specimens sold in the new society (Ceuterick, Vandebroek, Torry &Pieroni 2007: 157, 160-2; Ososki, Balick & Daly 2007: 29-30, 35; Palaniswamy 2007: 99;Viladrich 2007: 68-9; see also Pieroni, Zaman, Ayub & Torry 2010: 123). Plant speciesthat are unavailable may be substituted with other, more \u2018global species\u2019, such as garlic,camomile, mint, eucalyptus, aloe vera, and citrus fruits (Ceuterick et al. 2007: 160).Several studies found a high correspondence between the self-medication of minorailments like flus, colds, and respiratory complaints, but also that common healthconditions in the home societies had been replaced in the new societies with otherconditions such as diabetes andhigh cholesterol,whichnecessitateddifferent treatments(Palaniswamy 2007: 90-1; Vandebroek et al. 2007: 59-60; see also Pieroni et al. 2010: 126-7). An increasing preference for biomedical healthcare amongst younger generationswas associated with a desire for fast-acting treatment rather than waiting for traditionalremedies to take effect (Ceuterick et al. 2007: 161; see also Pieroni et al. 2010: 124-5).More recent work similarly highlights selective abandonment and innovation in use ofspecies and practices, according to the environment, social conditions, and healthcaresystem in the new country, migrants\u2019 local and transnational social networks, and theease of plant importation (Pieroni et al. 2010; Pirker et al. 2012).We also sought to capture some of the changes in the use of plants across placeand time, although we were unable to observe such changes directly given the passageof time since the depopulation of Chagos. Instead, we asked Chagos islanders andtheir children and grandchildren in Mauritius and the UK to reflect upon their use ofplants before and after migration from Chagos and from Mauritius or Seychelles, andthe ways in which knowledge about plants is transmitted. They indicated continuitiesand innovations in their use of plants, but also increasing constraints upon access tocertain plants and the transmission of botanical knowledge. Chagos islanders identifiedover one hundred plant species which they used on Chagos, fifty-five of which hadmedicinal uses. Certain medicinal species were very widely used: aloe vera (Aloebarbadensis in Latin, known as sandout ormarzanbon in Kreol), water hemp (Ayapanatriplinervis, or ayapana), farmer\u2019s friends (Bidens pilosa, or lavilbag), native dodder(Cassytha filiformis, or lalyan sanfan), Madagascar rosy periwinkle (Catharantus roseus,or saponer/roz amer), coconuts (Cocos nucifera, or koko), lemons and limes (Citruslimon and Citrus aurantifolia, or sitron and limon), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citatus,or sitronel), beach morning glory or goat\u2019s foot (Ipomoea pes-caprae, or batatran), airplant (Kalanchoe pinnata, or soudefaf), bird\u2019s nest fern (Asplenium nidus, or lalangvas),mint (Mentha x piperita, or lamant), dwarf sensitive (Mimosa pudica, or sansitiv), bittergourd (Momordica charantia, or margoz), Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia, or bwaJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 20166 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca Rottertorti/noni), castor oil plant (Ricinus communis, or palma kristi), Madagascar spur plant(Plectranthus madagascariensis, or baum de perou), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis, orzinzam).Chagos islanders described in detail their knowledge of the application of suchplants to aid the restoration of health, and there was a high level of consistency bothbetween the accounts of individuals, and between these and the ethnobotanical record(e.g. Gurib-Fakim, Sewraj, Gueho & Dulloo 1993; Louwe 1987; Sussman 1980; Tatayah2011). They used plants to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory illnessessuch as asthma, coughs, and colds; headaches, earaches, and associated fevers; skininfections and other dermatological problems such as spots, boils, itches, ringworm,cuts, and bruises; digestive disorders such as indigestion, reflux, gas, bloating, nausea,stomach ache, diarrhoea, vomiting, intestinal worms, dysentery, and lack of appetite;inflammation of the stomach or bladder, jaundice, stones, hernia, and haemorrhoids;high blood pressure, stroke, thick blood, and anaemia; and assorted other complaintsincluding cancer, diabetes, period pain, recovery after operations, malaise, toxic fishpoisoning, stings, and swollen or aching lower limbs. In general, botanical treatmentstook the form of eating the plant directly, preparing and drinking a tisane of infusedplant parts, preparing and bathing the body in a plant decoction or mashed and boiledplantmaterials, or applyingplantmatter to the skinbywashing, rubbing, or as apoultice.Sometimes Chagossians volunteered information about how their knowledge of a plantand its medical indications and contraindications had changed over the passage of timeand movement across geographical space. For instance, an elderly Chagossian man(who was an adult when he was removed from Chagos in 1973) recounted that Chagosislanders used to heat the leaves of Indian mulberry and apply them to aches and pains,and adults told children not to eat the seeds because they were thought to be poisonous;later, in Mauritius, he learned that the seeds were effective against diabetes and highblood pressure (see also Gurib-Fakim 2007: 113).Some treatments were culturally specific cures for conditions such as fever (esofman)and chills (freser), or topreventharmcausedby spirits orwitchcraft (see alsoLouwe 1987:102-6; Tatayah 2011), some of which were specifically used for children. For instance, inMauritius, tiny pimples on the skin of young breastfed babies are diagnosed as tanbav(impetigo) and are attributed to the mother\u2019s excessive consumption of \u2018hot\u2019 food(Louwe 1987: 102). In Crawley, a new-born baby deemed to have tanbavwas fed coolingoranges instead of being treated with the cream prescribed by the doctor. And whenanother new-born baby in Crawley suffered from colic, his mother sent for arrowrootfrom Mauritius.When speaking of the original migration from Chagos to Mauritius or Seychelles,Chagos islanders said that it was almost impossible to bring living plants or germplasmowing to the conditions under which the displacement took place: some islanders wentonwhat they expected to be short trips toMauritius and Seychelles only to be preventedfrom returning to Chagos; others were forced onto crowded ships bound for Mauritiusor Seychelles with little chance to gather what few possessions they had. Nevertheless,according to Chagos islanders\u2019 accounts, this restriction on plant transportation didnot significantly affect the continuity of botanical knowledge and plant use as many ofthe same species grew in Mauritius and Seychelles.In her report on the healthcare needs of the displaced Chagossian community inMauritius,Dr\u00e6bel (1997: 20-5) listed themainproblems affecting displacedChagossiansover the previous two decades: chronic illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure,Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 7cardio-vascular diseases, and obesity (all of which have high and rising prevalence inMauritius owing to high consumption of fatty foods, high cigarette and alcohol use, andlow levels of physical exercise); transmissible diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoea,and hepatitis A (which are associated with poverty and contaminated water supplies);workplace accidents; physical and mental disabilities; psychiatric disorders (such asepilepsy); and chronic depression (sagrin) resulting from the uprooting. Dr\u00e6bel (1997:30-3) noted that Chagossians \u2013 like others in Mauritius and Seychelles (see Gurib-Fakim et al. 1993: 184; Matatiken et al. 2011: 69; Sussman 1980: 262) \u2013 continued tocombine healthcare strategies, consulting a combination of doctors and traditionalhealers, and deploying a combination of biomedical, traditional, and homemade plant-based remedies.Some of our participants advocated the medicinal use of plants with reference to theethnobotanical argument (see, e.g., Gurib-Fakim 2007; Gurib-Fakim et al. 1993) that \u2018allpills originally came from plants\u2019, and that plants contain many active ingredients stillbeing explored scientifically. A striking example of the reluctance to abandon botanicaltreatments in favour of pharmaceuticals (see Whyte, van der Geest & Hardon 2002:74-5) was provided by Annette,2 a woman in her forties of Chagossian parentage whowas born and raised in Mauritius but now lives in Manchester. Annette described howin Mauritius she had once suffered from a bad case of haemorrhoids and had opted toself-administer the common treatment of beach morning glory (batatran), which, shesaid, is supposed to \u2018coax the haemorrhoids back up inside the body\u2019. She chuckled asshe explained how she underwent the slightly laborious and awkward process of boilingthe leaves in water and pouring this solution into a basin in which she then had tosit, soaking and washing the haemorrhoids at length. The treatment did not work as,she said, the haemorrhoids were now too big to retreat. Finally, she resorted to a tripto her doctor, to whom she explained the problem and the pain she was experiencing.Annette\u2019s reporting of her doctor\u2019s rather sage response produced fits of laughter duringour interview: \u2018Why\u2019, he asked, \u2018didn\u2019t you just take paracetamol?\u2019While plant use continued after displacement toMauritius and Seychelles, a differentpicture emerged of people\u2019s access to herbal medicine after onward migration to theUK. Upon arriving, people found that many of the key species that were used in theIndian Ocean were not present because they could not survive in the British climate, orwere not available on the market even if able to survive indoors. Some people pointedout that they would like to import particular plants that grow well on Indian Oceanislands \u2013 such as water hemp (ayapana), Madagascar rosy periwinkle (saponer), bird\u2019snest fern (lalangvas), firestick plant (bwamalgas), and various fruits \u2013 but are restrictedby customs regulations and the practicalities of air travel. In many cases, where desiredplant matter was found on sale in the UK, its market value was so high as to preventregular use or consumption. When we asked Chagossians in the UK what they nowuse to treat common ailments in the place of plants, the answer was often paracetamol.Nevertheless, certain \u2018global species\u2019 such as citrus fruits, lemongrass, aloe vera, bittergourd, and ginger were widely used.We also observed innovation in plant use. Annette and both of her parents, nowin their seventies, are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about medicinal plant use.Annette told us that since migrating to the UK she has discovered that a thyme tisanewith ginger and honey can be used for colds and bronchitis. During our interview,her parents spoke about using arrowroot in Chagos to treat diarrhoea and weakness.Annette had, unknowingly, discovered the same treatment herself:Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 20168 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca RotterI saw arrowroot in the shop. I didn\u2019t know my parents were using it. I only knew the flower inMauritius. I use the powder when I am weak and tired. Boil the water, add a spoonful of the powderuntil it becomes a clear gravy. You can drink it. There\u2019s no taste unless you want to add sugar.She also learned from her parents during the interview that on Chagos, Aztec marigold(pisanli)was boiledwith carrot to treat jaundice and anaemia. She remarked that shehadseen it in shops in the UK and would buy it and try using it. In sum, whilst structurallyconstrained by climate, customs regulations, and finances, Chagossian migrants arecontinuing to take advantage of the medicinal properties of plants about which theypossess knowledge and to which they have access, as well as experimenting with newmedicinal plants they encounter (cf. Bennett & Prance 2000; Pirker et al. 2012).But in the context of such changes and the inevitable decline in numbers of olderChagos islanders, several of our interviewees expressed a concern about the future ofmedicinal plant knowledge. This was evident in a conversation with Edmond, a Chagosislander in his fifties who was displaced to Seychelles, and Lucille, who was born inMauritius in the 1970s to Chagossian parents. Edmond and Lucille were concernedthat knowledge about plants is not being passed on to the younger generations in theUK, both because young people are not interested and because the lack of appropriateplants reduces the opportunity to practise traditional medicine, and they lamentedthe loss of cherished Chagossian collective knowledge. Lucille said that in Mauritiuspeople sometimes use lemon, water hemp, and camomile, but young people do notknowabout traditionalmedicine anddonot bother to learn from their elders, preferringjust to go to the doctor and take pills because this is quick and easy. Edmond noted thatinstead of using a blend of real orange and lemon juice to treat colds, young people buyan artificial lemon-flavoured drink (Lemsip). Thus people shared not only how theystrive to sustain and transmit medicinal plant knowledge, but also their concerns abouthow displacement and migration can result in the transformation or loss of certaincultural heritage practices, including those involving plants.Plant exchange in the nourishment of social relationshipsThis section examines how plant exchange connects people to other people. Recentanthropological work on allotment gardening and the exchange of houseplants inthe UK has explored the role of networks of relationships in the dispersal and culturalselectionofplant germplasm(Ellen&Platten 2011), shownhowplant exchange canmarkexisting relationships or forge new relationships (Degnen 2009: 162), and suggested thatthe flow of germplasm can match an individual\u2019s network of social interactions (Ellen&Koma\u00b4romi 2013: 4). Two recent studies (Ellen &Koma\u00b4romi 2013; Ellen & Platten 2011)explore patterns of exchange of plants and plant materials in allotments and domesticsettings, respectively. Both studies confirm that the physical qualities of plants andpropagates \u2013 such as their life expectancy, size, durability, and ease of handling \u2013 makethemmore or less conducive tomigration and exchange. However, equally importantly,they find that plant dissemination is inextricably linked to social networks and patternsof social interaction. For example, potted plants tend to be exchanged more often thangarden plants firstly because they are more likely to be tended by women, who generallymaintain more extensive social networks and use plants as gifts, and secondly becausethey are present in domestic spaces, where a greater degree of social interaction occurs(Ellen & Koma\u00b4romi 2013: 4). Nevertheless, allotments are also important sites for theproduction and dispersal of plant materials and produce, either as \u2018free gifts\u2019, or as partof long-term gift exchange. Platten (2013: 316) suggests that the gifting of early growthJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 9plant material is part of a cultural model that reinforces the transmission of gardeningknowledge within the horticultural community of practice: the ability to give signifiesgardening experience, and giving is thereby a means by which gardeners achieve socialstanding and reciprocate the generosity that was shown to them in their own earlygardening years.While these authors map the direction and types of plant exchanges which occurbetween actors, their focus is neither on the relationships between giver and receiver,nor on the role of plants in such relationships. The question that remains is: whatdoes plant exchange do for connections and relationships between people, particularlyin the context of community dispersal? It is well established that gifting objects is ameans by which ties and obligations are forged between the giver and the recipient,who is expected to reciprocate in the future (Godelier 1999; Mauss 1990 [1924]). Giftedobjects bear something of the identity of the giver, which the recipient acquires alongwith the gift itself (Mauss 1990 [1924]; Strathern 1988). At the level of cross-borderexchanges between migrants, the literature on transnationalism has demonstrated thatthe transfer of financial remittances (i.e. capital) and \u2018social remittances\u2019 (i.e. norms,practices, and social capital) sustains links between sending and receiving countriesand enhances (uneven) social development in the latter (King 1986; Levitt 2001; Levitt& Lamba-Nieves 2011). However, it has had much less to say about the circulation andexchange of objects in general or plants and plant materials in particular.A notable exception is Abranches\u2019s (2014) study of \u2018material remittances\u2019, includingfood, traditional botanical medicines, and animal-derived amulets, sent from Guinea-Bissau to Portugal, and money, clothes, documents, and electrical goods, sent in theopposite direction. She argues that such giving and reciprocating sustains and reinforcesrelationships between dispersed family members, as well as keeping open possibilitiesfor outward and returnmigration (Abranches 2014: 271). Guineanmigrants in PortugalconsumeGuinean foods and plantmedicines in an effort to prevent and treat illness andspiritual deterioration caused by migration to Europe. Their perceived benefit derivesboth from the fact that they are regarded as more natural and healthy than Europeanequivalents (owing to the limited use of chemical fertilizers in Guinea-Bissau), andfrom their ability to offer migrants bodily protection by forging links to Guineansoil/territory (tchon), which constitutes a fundamental part of Guinean cosmology.Those who remain in Guinea-Bissau also benefit frommaterial remittances in terms ofincreased social status, wealth, and the possibility of migrating themselves. Abranchesconcludes that \u2018[t]hings sent in both directions contribute to maintaining physical,spiritual, and social well-being (the latter understood as a sign of prosperity), as dothe relationships and mutual reciprocities that their movements generate\u2019 (2014: 270).Thus, althoughexchange canbeunderstood in termsof themaintenanceof relationshipswhich are otherwise at risk of failing, the gifting of plants in particularmay be importantfor diasporic communities owing to their material properties and symbolic associationwith place, which is tied to wellbeing.Both Volpato, Emhamed, Saleh, Broglia, and di Lello (2007) and Cabral de Oliveira(2008) have explored the interdependence of plant use and social relations amongmobile peoples. Volpato et al. (2007: 257) suggest that the continued practice oftraditional medicine helps Sahrawian refugees in Algerian refugee camps to resistassimilation and to maintain links with their place of origin, but the acquisition ofbotanical resources for such medicine depends upon the maintenance of social tieswith dispersed community members, including family, friends, market holders, andJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 201610 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca Rottertravelling traders. Cabral de Oliveira (2008: 105) finds that Waja\u02dcpi women in Brazilengage in plant migration and exchange, particularly between their natal and affinalvillages, and that such activity is reflected in the botanical naming system, whereplants are named according to their sociological origin and introduction pathway.Consequently, each garden \u2018keeps alive thememory of a large body of social and kindredhistorical data\u2019 (Cabral de Oliveira 2008: 106). TheWaja\u02dcpi love of plant diversity derivesfrom the fact that plants come from other places and are the product of a relation ofalterity, but it also sustains large networks of relationships with other people (Cabralde Oliveira 2008: 109).Medical anthropologists have shown that medical practices \u2013 including thoseinvolving plants \u2013 have material significance for facilitating, marking, and reinforcingsocial relations (van der Geest, Whyte & Hardon 1996: 168). Whyte et al. (2002: 5)argue that as tangible, intimate, and personal objects, medicines (which may be plant-based) carry manifold meanings, such as expressing caring for others, or empoweringpeople in the face of uncertainty. Whyte (1988) has also shown that, conversely,biomedicines may be individualizing or socially distancing, as they allow healthcareto be removed from its embeddedness in social relations. Edible and medicinal plantshave long been enmeshed in patterns of social interaction and exchange amongstthe Chagossian community, whether resident in Chagos, Mauritius, Seychelles, or theUK. The inhabitants of the Chagos islands had access to plots of land on which theyplanted food crops. Chagos islanders correlated the proximity of living quarters andthe abundance of freely available food on Chagos with a community spirit of sharing.People would freely give away ripe produce from their kitchen gardens to family andfriends in the knowledge that they would later receive produce from others. Accordingto their nostalgic recollections, people did not keep track of precisely what was givenand received, but expected their exchanges to even out in the long run. Thus theyrecalled an ideal social system of generalized reciprocity. This \u2018spirit of sharing\u2019 (lespripartaz), Chagossians reported, had become difficult to sustain owing to the chronicimpoverishment and geographical dispersal of the displaced community (Jeffery 2011:65-6). Nevertheless, Chagossians who live in houses (rather than apartment blocks) inMauritius and Seychelles often have small gardens in which they grow edible plants thatthey do indeed share generously amongst neighbours, friends, and relatives, and oneroutinely leaves a household following a visit laden with a bunch of greens or handfulsof ripe mango, papaya, lychee, or coconut.Many Chagossians in the UK return to Mauritius or Seychelles periodically tovisit friends and relatives. They do not generally transport plant matter from theUK to Mauritius or Seychelles, but they often return to the UK bearing plant matterfrom Mauritius or Seychelles for distribution in the UK. They might bring foodstuffs:homemade specialities such as coconut crunch, pickles, chutneys, and compotes; deep-fried balls of yellow split peas (gato-pima), flatbread (roti), and flatbread stuffed withmashed yellow split peas (dal pouri) from Mauritius or rock-hard cassava cakes fromSeychelles; or \u2018local\u2019 produce such as fresh fish, salt fish, tea, or spices, which areconsidered better quality than those available in the UK (even if fresh fish is frozenfor the journey or the spices actually originated in the Indian subcontinent). Or theymight deliver medicinal plants: a Chagossian woman in Mauritius described how shehad prepared a package for her son in Crawley containing coconut roots (rasinn koko),barley (lorz), and linseed (grin de lin) to be heated and made into a refreshing drink totreat inflammation of the throat or stomach.Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 11Chagossians who have visited Chagos also return bearing medicinal plants fortheir friends and family. The bwa sousouri plant (Ochrosia parviflora) is indigenous toSeychelles (Gurib-Fakim & Brendler 2004: 343), and apparently not present elsewherein the Indian Ocean (Schmelzer 2008: 391), apart from Chagos. Infusions of its crushedleaves are used to cleanse the blood, topromote abortion, as a purgative and carminative,to stimulate the appetite, for abdominal pains, and to wash a woman\u2019s abdomen afterchildbirth (see Gurib-Fakim& Brendler 2004: 344; Schmelzer 2008: 391). Several peopletold us that they had brought bwa sousouri leaves from Cannon Point on Diego Garciato treat diabetes and cleanse the blood of family and friends in the UK. Thus theprovisionof edible andmedicinal plants continues to be apractice bywhichChagossiansmark and maintain their relationships with others in the extended Chagossiancommunity.Chagossian elders who prepare herbal remedies for themselves and others encountervarying degrees of receptiveness amongst their intended recipients. One Chagossianwoman in her eighties explained that her children and grandchildren in Crawley refuseto join her in taking a daily dose of bitter aloe vera to ward off cancers because, as sheput it, \u2018they don\u2019t believe in it, they have more faith in the doctor\u2019s remedies\u2019. However,she said that they would accept her sweet, refreshing, cleansing drinks made fromlinseed and barley, mint, a Seychellois ironwood (Vernonia cinerea, or gerivit), or holybasil (Ocimum tenuiflorum, or tokmarya). So while biomedicines may allow healthcareto be removed from its embeddedness in social relations (Whyte 1988), the adoptionof biomedicine is not necessarily at the expense of more socially embedded forms ofhealthcare: the two may coexist. Thus despite geographical, environmental, financial,and regulatory constraints, migrants continue to deploy plants as a form of culturalheritage that nourishes kinship and other social relationships within the extended anddispersed community.Plant symbolism and materiality in the cultivation of linksto idealized homelandsIn this section, we examine anthropological explorations of botanical metaphors thatillustrate a sedentary logic that roots particular people in particular places, and we showhow migration both is unsettling and unsettles such assumptions. Until the eighteenthcentury the word \u2018culture\u2019 \u2013 which derives from the Latin for \u2018cultivation\u2019 \u2013 referred tothe \u2018natural growth\u2019 of plants, but by the end of the nineteenth century it was appliedalso to individuals and societies (Clifford 1988: 337; Malkki 1992: 29; Wagner 1981: 21).Botanical concepts \u2013 native, indigenous, autochthonous, rooted \u2013 link people andcultures metaphorically to territories and soil. And the naturalization of a sedentary,rooted existence is also reflected in the languages of disjuncture used to describehuman migration and displacement: transplantation and uprooting (Malkki 1992:31). In addition to botanical metaphors, Malkki notes the performance of embodiedrelationships to one\u2019s homeland: out-migrants may take soil, plants, or seeds withthem, and returning nationals (especially politicians) often kiss the ground when theyreturn to \u2018national soil\u2019 (Malkki 1992: 27). Bardenstein (1998), Ben-Ze\u2019ev (2004), andBraverman (2009) have explored the political deployment of trees in Israel/Palestine,where both sides have planted trees to assert their rootedness; burned down oruprooted trees planted by their political opponents; and claimed particular speciesas evidence of their own belonging, although the specific species seem to change overtime.Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 201612 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca RotterExploring the significance of plants for displaced people seeking to sustain linksto their homeland, Jepson (2006) has written about gardening practices of GreekCypriots who fled Karavas after the Turkish invasion in 1974. Soon after arrival on therefugee estates outside Nicosia, the refugees planted trees that would take many yearsto bear fruit, implying an urgent desire \u2018to re-root themselves\u2019 (Jepson 2006: 165). Theycontinued to grow many of the same crops as they had grown in their larger plotsin Karavas, and these familiar crops revived their memories of their homes, with theadded nostalgia of recalling that the crops grewbetter inKaravas than inNicosia (Jepson2006: 164). Sutton (2001) and Petridou (2001) have similarly shown how Greek foodevokes nostalgia about romanticized pasts and places. In the Greek village of Kalymnos,Sutton argues, narratives of food and community dovetail with memories of a pastcharacterized by natural produce and a sharing mentality (Sutton 2001: 53-5). Greekstudents in the UK viewed food from Greece as flavourful, fresh, carefully selected,and prepared or cooked over time, with associations of sociality, family, and caring;in contrast, they described \u2018English\u2019 food as superficially pleasant yet tasteless, lackingin nutritional content, and ready-made or easily prepared so as to provide a quick,practical means to an end, which evoked social alienation (Petridou 2001: 93-4, 97).Food thus has a symbolic potential, to evoke home and the values associated with it,and to mark the boundaries between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 (Petridou 2001: 98). Followingthese insights, we are similarly interested in how people use plants to mark connectionsto specific territories.Chagos islanders refer to their displacement as uprooting (derasinman) andcollectively self-identify as an uprooted people (enn lepep derasine) which has sufferedfrom sorrow, sadness, and impoverishment (sagrin, tristes, mizer), living in exile (exil)from its natal homeland (later natal) (Jeffery 2011: 4), and they have actively campaignedfor the right of return to Chagos. In 2006, the UK government organized a short returnvisit for one hundred Chagossians living in Mauritius, Seychelles, and the UK, whocongregated in Mauritius to travel to Chagos by boat. The Royal Navy film of thevisit shows the moments when Chagossians disembarked at the three main formerlyinhabited islands \u2013Boddam Island in the SalomonAtoll, I\u02c6le duCoin in the Peros BanhosAtoll, and Diego Garcia \u2013 where they immediately prostrate themselves on the ground,recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer, sing hymns led by the two priests who accompanied the visit,and weep as they sing a popular Chagossian anthem, Ton Vie\u00b4\u2019s Peros Vert (Green Peros).Most years since 2006, the UK government has organized smaller-scale visits byplane. Chagossians who have been on these visits were keen to talk about the conditionson Chagos, particularly the environmental changes that the islands had undergonein the four decades since they were depopulated (see Jeffery 2013). In particular, theycontrasted the overgrown coconut plantations with the absence of useful, edible, ormedicinal plants that the islanders had cultivated (see Jeffery 2014). People spoke aboutthe things that they had brought back \u2013 or had wanted to bring back \u2013 includingpersonal or household belongings: one person managed to find her parents\u2019 formerhouse, and brought back their kettle and bucket; another had failed to find the spotwhere he believed a relative had buried money before leaving Chagos. But for the mostpart people had wanted to bring back sand or edible plant and animal specimens,especially coconuts, coconut crabs, and fish. In 2006, people were prohibited fromtaking sand fromChagos, but the UK government\u2019s stance seems to have been graduallyrelaxed: during the most recent visits, people were evidently allowed to fish, harvestcoconuts and edible greens, craft baskets out of coconut leaves, and bottle sand. OneJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 13Chagos islander in her fifties, whose house in London is decorated with coconuthandicrafts and jars of sand from the islands, told us that she took some tiny cuttingsof the firestick plant (Euphorbia tirucalli, known as bwa malgas) and brought themback to the UK, where she planted them outside in pots, only to lose them to thesnails.In 2009, the largest Chagossian group in Mauritius, the Chagos Refugees Group(CRG), moved to its own newly acquired spacious premises in Pointe aux Sables to thesouth of the capital Port Louis. The CRG nightwatchman, France Bertrand, who wasborn on I\u02c6le du Coin in the Peros Banhos Atoll in 1943 and whose father was a gardeneron Chagos, set about establishing a garden showcasing plants that had been present onthe islands: five varieties of coconut, banana palms, papaya trees, passionfruit vines, andflowering medicinal plants, including the white and the pink varieties of Madagascarrosy periwinkle (saponer blan and saponer roz). For Olivier Bancoult, leader of theCRG, who was also born on I\u02c6le du Coin, in 1964, the explicit purpose is to create a \u2018littleChagos\u2019 in Mauritius. Thus displaced Chagossians deploy migrating plants and otherorganic matter to display their (uprooted) roots in Chagos.At the same time, however, displaced Chagossians also use plants that emphasizespecific aspects of their lives in Mauritius or Seychelles. The most interesting exampleof this is bred mouroum, the tiny leaves of the drumstick tree (Moringa oleifera), whichhave to be laboriously plucked individually from sprigs. On Chagos, people said, bredmouroum was cooked as a watery soup made with oil, onion, and garlic (bouillon),fried with onion, garlic, salt, and chilli (toufe), or stewed in coconut milk (seraz)and served as an accompaniment to fish and rice (see Scott 1961: 232); the plant\u2019slong, slender seedpods (called drumsticks in English, or baton mouroum in Kreol) arecooked with yellow split peas. In Mauritius, toufe bred mouroum is routinely servedwhenever the CRG produces a typical Chagossian meal for guests or fundraising opendays. In Mauritius and Seychelles alike, however, where bred mouroum grows wild andplentifully and is thus freely available, it is associated with extreme poverty (mizermizer) and known as a poor food (manze mizer), so its inclusion in Chagossian cuisinein Mauritius not only marks links to the homeland, but also recalls extreme povertysuffered particularly upon arrival in Mauritius. As one Chagossian woman in her fiftiesput it,Bred mouroum and papaya are the only reason that we did not die, because there was nothing elseto eat, and we did not have to pay for bred mouroum and papaya. We lived in mizer mizer, we hada tin shack but rain came through the roof and we did not have any spare clothes when we got wet. . . we had left all of our things behind [on Chagos]. Sometimes we managed to get food, somebred mouroum, but we had no oil or salt to cook it in, and even if you have food, you need to havesomething to cook it on, so sometimes we had to use old clothes and set them on fire.Jeffery (2011: 116-18, 123-7) has argued elsewhere that for the Chagossian community,migration has brought about reformulations and conceptions of home: when they wereresident in Mauritius, life in Mauritius was depicted as inferior to life in Chagos; whenthey were resident in the UK, however, life in Mauritius was depicted as having certainbenefits compared to life in the UK, such as a higher quality of life. In our more recentdiscussions about the environment, Chagossians sometimes used plants tomake similarcontrasts. References to botanical abundance, taste, accessibility, and affordability werewoven through a conversation with Gabriel and Reginald, two men in their forties andfifties, respectively, who were born on Chagos, spent most of their lives in Seychelles,and had recentlymigrated to the UK.When asked whether they now use or eat plants orJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 201614 Laura Jeffery & Rebecca Rotterfood from Seychelles, Gabriel replied that foodstuffs from Seychelles were not readilyavailable or were too expensive in the UK. He continued:In Seychelles, people live in nature. In England, people live outside of nature, in the house. InMauritiusand Seychelles, people live outside. You don\u2019t have to buy everything. On the way home, you pickfood for your dinner. You pick bilinbi, it\u2019s a plant with small leaves that grows wild, like spinach, youpick coconut, so you prepare your food on the way home.Reginald contrasted the abundance of fresh fruit on Chagos and Seychelles with therelatively expensive and poor-quality fruit in the UK, and concluded, \u2018I\u2019ll go back [toChagos]. It\u2019s a better life there than here. The life is more nature. I was born there. Iwill get fresh fish, fresh vegetables. In this world, everything you want to buy, you haveto have money\u2019. Plants were thus used not only to mark people\u2019s sensory connectionswith Chagos and Mauritius or Seychelles, but also to argue for the superiority of thoseenvironments in comparison with that of the UK, owing to the perceived poor quality,scarcity, and commodification of produce in the latter. Thus migrants deploy plantsnostalgically in two ways \u2013 firstly to cultivate their connections to a specific homeland,and secondly to highlight the superiority of this homeland \u2013 both of which resonatewith the nostalgic deployment of other forms of cultural heritage.A bigger picture emerging from our material is of the way in which Chagossians\u2019relationships with plants have changed in parallel with their engagement in variouseconomies. On Chagos, they grew, worked with, and used plants to meet amultitude of practical needs. In Mauritius and Seychelles, they may have tendedsmall gardens and harvested wild plants, but they have become increasingly relianton markets. In the UK, people live more urbanized, indoor life-styles with a highdegree of plant commodification. Thus the community has increasingly outsourcedthe provision of food and healthcare, and there has been a discernible shift inboth the accessibility and the perceived usefulness of growing plants. Nevertheless,plants remain important resources for the Chagossian community, as reflected inthe accounts of native islanders and their second-generation descendants who arecommitted to continuity and innovation in medicinal plant use. The prevalenceof herbal remedies in health food stores and the widespread availability of \u2018globalspecies\u2019 means that people can sometimes (re)discover medicinal plants in unexpectedplaces.ConclusionEthnobotanists have traditionally sought to record and preserve botanical knowledgeand patterns of plant use, sometimes in an effort to \u2018salvage\u2019, whether to enhancebiodiversity, or for posterity. While we share a concern to explore and safeguard plantknowledge and use, our aim has not been to record the full range of Chagossianrelationshipswith plants, nor to preserveChagossian plant knowledge and use as a staticrepository. Indeed, our ethnographic material highlights that plant knowledge and useis not unchanging: in many cases, the people we encountered were actively innovatingplant use, and developing additional knowledge of plants in their pharmacopeia in newsettings. Rather, we have applied the insight from critical heritage studies that heritage isa process of selecting and valuing certain objects, artefacts, and practices, which can becreatively used for the purposes of the present. This facilitates an appreciation of plantsas more than a tool or possession. They are, we argue, a form of living cultural heritage:the site of valued and embodied collective knowledge and expertise pertaining to lifeJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 22, 1-18C\u00a9 Royal Anthropological Institute 2016Sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation 15on Chagos; of symbolic and material connections to significant people and places; andof practices through which specific memories can be selected for transmission to futuregenerations. Plants are (or once were) living heritage not only in a biological sense, butalso in the sense that knowledge and use is shifting over time and space. Chagossianscreatively use plants to meet the demands of the present: plants help to sustain valuedcultural practices and knowledge; to nourish social relationships within an increasinglydispersed community; and to cultivate nostalgic links to and belonging in idealizedhomes and homelands.While several other objects might perform one or more of these roles, we suggestthat the combinationof phytochemical properties, symbolic values, and transportabilitymakes plants particularly well suited to perform all three. At the same time, however,the capacity of plants to contribute to sustenance, nourishment, and cultivation inthe lives of migrants is challenged in several ways: plants familiar from a previousenvironment may not thrive in the new environment, they may be prohibitivelyexpensive, or their import may be restricted. The obstacles to the intergenerationaltransmission of knowledge and themaintenance of cultural practices within a dispersedcommunity several decades after displacement from the homeland are not restrictedto plant knowledge and use, but plants do illustrate some of the common problems:young people with busy working lives may feel that they do not have the time to learnhow to use medicinal plants, which, anyway, they may fear will take too long to takeeffect compared to biomedical remedies. Rather than seeking to preserve an imaginedstatic relationship between people and plants, we have instead sought to elucidate thesocial implications of obstacles and transformations alike.NOTESThis research was funded by an Economic and Social Research Council Research Fellowship (RES-063-27-0214).

Deuxie`mement, l\u2019e\u00b4change de plantes nourrit les liensde parente\u00b4 et autres relations sociales avec la communaute\u00b4 e\u00b4largie. Troisie`mement, le symbolisme et lamate\u00b4rialite\u00b4 des plantes cultivent des liens nostalgiques avec un pays natal ide\u00b4alise\u00b4 dans un contexte dedispersion diasporique. Il n\u2019en reste pas moins que la contribution des plantes a` ces processus sociaux estlimite\u00b4e par les obstacles a` la transmission interge\u00b4ne\u00b4rationnelle du savoir dans le temps et l\u2019espace et parles restrictions e\u00b4cologiques, financie`res et re\u00b4glementaires oppose\u00b4es a` la migration des ve\u00b4ge\u00b4taux. L\u2019articlefait valoir que pour la communaute\u00b4 chagossienne de\u00b4place\u00b4e, les plantes sont un patrimoine culturel vivantayant un potentiel social (si restreint soit-il) dans un contexte de dislocation et de perte, de souffranceencore vive et de dispersion ge\u00b4ographique.Laura Jeffery is Lecturer in Social Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh.
