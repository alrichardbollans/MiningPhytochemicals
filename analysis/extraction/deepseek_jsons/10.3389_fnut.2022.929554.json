(Garlic) belongs to the familyAmaryllidaceae, has been originated in Asia, and is alsowidely cultivated in Egypt, Mexico, China, and Europe(1). This plant is highly consumed in Iran, where itsfoliage, flowers, and cloves are employed in local medicine(1). All parts of A. sativum, bulbs, leaves, cloves, andflowers are utilized to prepare mixtures and decoctionsto deal with various ailments. It is also a common spiceand food additive. Studies on its phytochemistry indicatethat sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin, are theessential components. Allicin (diallyl-dithiosulfinate) isthe most important alkaloid responsible for its beneficialeffects. Other sulfur-containing phytochemicals found inA. sativum include diallyl disulphide (DDS), diallyl trisulfide(DTS), and S-allyl cysteine (SAC), which have a varietyof pharmacological properties (1). In India, A. sativum isused to treat fever, coughs and is administered topicallyagainst scabies, graying of hair, and eczema, as well asagainst inflammation of the tetanus and lungs (2). InPakistan, the plant extract is consumed orally againststomach ailments, respiratory problems, and fever. InNepal, the Middle East and East Asia, the plant is appliedagainst fevers, rheumatism, liver disorders, diabetes, colic,intestinal worms, dysentery, flatulence, tuberculosis, highblood pressure, facial paralysis, and bronchitis. In Africa,the plant has been reported to be an antibiotic, antiviral,hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, and antithrombotic (2\u20134).In this review, the phytotherapeutic properties of garlichave been comprehensively investigated to provide anupdated overall view of one of the most used (and best-selling) medicinal and food plants in the world with noteson ethnobotanical information validated by preclinicalbioactivities (i.e., in vitro and in vivo), emphasizing themechanisms and signaling pathways involved. We havealso discussed the recent breakthroughs and bottlenecks ofrelevant research on garlic with notes on future perspectives ongarlic research.Botany and geographicaldistribution of Allium sativumA. sativum L. (Figure 1), commonly known as garlic,belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae (5). The bulb is mostlyused to treat ailments and the perennial herbaceous plantis large, with upright flowering stems that extend up to1 m (6). The leaf blades are linear, flattened, robust, andapproximately 0.5\u20131.0 inch (1.25\u20132.5 cm) long, with a pointedapex and violet to fuchsia flowers that bloom in the NorthernHemisphere during monsoons. Slender leaves on the exteriorof the odoriferous bulb surround an internal sheath containingthe cloves, and each bulb contains 10\u201320 cloves.1 Its medicalbenefits have been documented in Sanskrit texts dating backabout 5,000 years and it first appeared in traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) at least 3,000 years ago (5). Today, garlic isgrown almost everywhere and is known to have more than300 varieties (7). At present, A. sativum is cultivated aroundthe world. It was first discovered in Central Asia, then spreadthroughout China, the Near East, and the Mediterranean beforemaking its way to the southern and middle parts of Europe,Mexico, and northern Africa, especially Egypt (5). Garlic is aperennial herb that thrives in mild regions and can be grown allyear. Sowing each clove in the ground is a method to propagatethe plant in cultivation asexually. Cloves are usually sown 6weeks before the land freezes in the cold season. The bulbs onlyproduce roots and have no stems above the surface.Phytochemistry of Allium sativumA. sativum bulbs are reported to have many bioactivecompounds, many of which are sulfur-containing, viz.thiosulfinates (allicin), sulfides [diallyl disulfide (DADS)],vinyldithiins (2-vinyl-(4H)-1,3-dithiin, 3-vinyl-(4H)-1,2-dithiin), ajoenes (E-ajoene and Z-ajoene) diallyl trisulfide(DATS), and so on constituting up to 82% of the total sulfurcontent in garlic. Allicin, S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide (MCSO),and S-propylcysteine sulfoxide (PCSO) are the main noxiouscompounds, with allicin being the predominant cysteinesulfoxide. Allicin, MCSO and PCSO, upon acted on byvarious enzymes, further produce molecules that include allylmethane thiosulfinates, methyl methanethiosulfonate and otherthiosulfinates (8\u201310).

with HT22 rodent hippocampus cell culturerevealed that the ethanolic infusion of garlic seedlings hadantioxidant properties by DPPH scavenging activity andsuppression of ROS (12). AG or aged garlic, as well as NG ornon-aged garlic by-products that were extracted with distilledwater, ethyl alcohol, or dichloromethane, showed distinctantioxidant effects as measured by radical scavenging testsABTS, DPHH and H2O2, total Fe3+ reducing antioxidantpower (FRAP) assay and Fe2+ chelating experiment (13).Unlike MCG or multi clove garlic isolates, SCG or single clovegarlic ones exhibited a substantial increase in scavenging activityin the DPPH test and superoxide radicals. SCG is more resistantto CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity than MCG, and it may be aneffective substitute drug for severe oxidative hepatotoxicity (14).Hepatoprotective activityThe liver-protecting potential of fermented garlic extractsproduced by lactic acid bacteria toward acetaminophen (AAP)resulted in acute liver damage in rodents was discovered in astudy. Bacteria suppress AAP-induced cell death in hepatocytesby inhibiting the MAPK phosphorylation route and down-regulating p53, which is involved in liver autophagy, andby cytoplasmic redox command, as evidenced by reductionof oxidative stress, glutathione and ATP exhaustion, andantioxidant enzyme actions (15). Further analysis revealedthat alcohol administration increased ROS/RNS generation invarious animals. It depleted liver antioxidant status, decreasedliver glutathione (GSH) concentrations, and decreasedsuperoxide dismutase activity (SOD). Only garlic compoundscan shield the liver from ethanol-induced peroxidation, asevidenced by a decrease in the marker of oxidative damage(malondialdehyde, MDA) and recovery of hepatoprotectiveaction (16). The consequences of aqueous Garlic bulb isolateon alloxan-induced plasma advancements in liver enzymes andurinary metabolic indicators in Wistar rats were examined. Theliver enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, andalkaline phosphatase have been associated with the leakage ofcytoplasm from hepatocytes into the circulation as a conditionof hepatotoxicity. The result showed that when comparedto control, the plasma levels of all the parameters evaluatedin the rats given garlic [urea, creatinine, albumin, aspartatetransaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkalinephosphate (ALP)] were unaltered (17). In the livers of albinorodents, Kaur and Sharma (18) found that ethanol extractsof garlic and ascorbic acid mixtures have hepatoprotectiveaction toward Cd damage. Cadmium administered mice hada substantial increase in the amount of malignant growth,such as multinucleated nuclei and gigantic cells, which wasreversed by administering ascorbic acid and ethanolic extract,which provided protection against the toxicity. Garlic also showhepatoprotective properties due to its organosulfur compoundslike diallyldisulfide (DDS) and diallyltrisulfides (DTS), whichhave antioxidant and detoxifying properties. These compoundsFrontiers in Nutrition 08 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 9Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554can reduce Cd-induced oxidative stress below the thresholdlevel, produce preconditioning effects by activating survivalsignals, and activate DNA repair systems by reducing thebinding of Cd with DNA (18).Anti-inflammatory activityIn lipopolysaccharide treated J774A.1 macrophages (19)probed the anti-inflammatory attributes of Allium 14-kDaprotein, something that impeded inflammatory agents suchas nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E (PGE), TNF-, andinterleukin (IL)-1 by impairing the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling route (19). Morihara et al. (20) discovered thatAG extract has a significant anti-inflammatory action and canassist to inhibit inflammatory responses in mouse models withapolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-KO). In hepatocytes, AGtreatment decreased TNF constructions, a prominent stimulusresulting in CRP synthesis, by 35%, downregulated interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) by 60%, and increasedadenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)production (20). Ethyl linoleate (ELA), an essential fatty acidseparated from garlic cloves, was demonstrated to suppressinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) formed as a result ofLPS treatment, transcription of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) andthe generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inactivationof NF-B as well as the MAPKs and phosphorylation of theAkt circuits were responsible for this action. In RAW 264.7cells, ELA-triggered heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) regulatesthe reduction of LPS-induced NO and pro-inflammatorycytokine synthesis. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effectsof ELA were established and ELA could be employed asa medical therapy to treat inflammation-related disorders(21). In BALB/c mice experiencing schistosomiasis, Metwallyet al. (22) evaluated the possible anti-inflammatory effect ofgarlic extract and allicin against liver inflammatory indicators(S. mansoni infection). Both preventive and therapeuticinjection of garlic extract or allicin into affected mice showedconsiderable immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatorybenefits in this investigation. The immunohistochemicalproduction of fibronectin and -SMA, as well as the transcriptionof inflammatory cytokines mRNA as indicators of liverfibrosis, indicate these consequences. Garlic significantlyinhibited inflammatory cytokine expression, suggesting that thealtered Th1/Th2 cytokine balance was the cause of the serumconcentrations of liver fibrosis markers and proinflammatorycytokines. These markers were maintained by decreasingserum ALT and AST levels, granuloma size as well as thenumber of inflammatory cells, collagen fibers, and eggs in thegranuloma (22).Cardioprotective activityTakashima et al. (23) found that the vasorelaxant impactof AG on the rat aorta had a substantial cardioprotectiveaction in lowering arterial pressure. Endothelium-dependentvasorelaxation of the aorta is caused by AGE, which promotesvasodilation by increasing the synthesis of NO controlled byeNOS. L-arginine, a NOS precursor, was found to be one ofthe key elements of the AGE\u2019s vasorelaxant action. Additionally,the source of AGE\u2019s action to reduce arterial pressure in drugtesting and in vivo testing remains unknown (23). On 22total cholesterol tests (TC), 17 LDL cholesterol experiments(LDL-C), 18 HDL cholesterol tests (HDL-C), four fastingblood glucose tests (FBG), nine tribulations of systolic bloodpressure (SBP) and 10 tests of diastolic blood pressure (DBP),A. sativum particle isolate was found to have cardioprotectiveactivity. Garlic flour formulations were found to be a universalcardiac and circulatory tonic, lowering blood TC, LDL-C,HDL-C, FBG, SBP, and DBP (24). Another study looked atthe effects of fermented garlic extract (FGE) on pulmonaryarterial hypertension in rats given monocrotaline (MCT). Inthe right ventricular, MCT treatment increased weight, arterialstiffness, and atrial natriuretic peptide levels, although notin the left ventricle. FGE decreased these impacts, as wellas pulmonary arteriole endothelial dysfunction and medialhypertrophy, pulmonary fibrosis produced by translations ofPKG, MCT, and eNOS proteins in the lung, and increasedtranslations of the VCAM-1 and MMP-9 proteins in the lung.FGE also inhibited an available guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor.The impact of FGE on MCT-induced heart attack in rats hasbeen found to have cardioprotective effects, according to thisresearch (25).Anticancer activityIn rodents with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-inducedtumorigenesis and multiplication of human colon tumor cells,Jikihara et al. (26) studied the anticancer effects of alcoholextracts of A. sativum. Pathological study shows that A. sativumextract can decrease adenocarcinoma and adenoma. Jikiharaet al. (26) investigated the cytotoxic activity of A. sativumaqueous preparations in rodents with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine(DMH)-induced carcinogenesis and human colorectal tumorcell proliferation. Adenocarcinoma and adenoma can bereduced by isolate of A. sativum, according to histopathologicalresearch. Apoptosis was not induced by AGE, but it did slowdown cell cycle progression by decreasing the expression ofcyclin B1 and cdk1 in human colorectal cancer cells (26).The impacts of garlic extract on the growth of human breastcancer cell lines (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3), liver (Hep-G2),and colon (Caco-2), as well as mice macrophage cells, wereinvestigated in a study (TIB-71). Exposure of Hep-G2, MCF-7, TIB-71, and PC-3 cells with crude garlic excerpt decreasedcell proliferation by 80\u201390%, but only 40\u201355% in Caco-2cells. It also caused growth arrest and a four-fold increasein caspase activation (apoptosis) in PC-3 cells. Accordingto this research, crude garlic powder contains reactive fattycomponents and could be employed as a chemoprevention (27).A study examined the antitumor properties of diallyl trisulfideFrontiers in Nutrition 09 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 10Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554(DATS). In vitro and in vivo treatment of patient gastriccancer cell SGC-7901 using a flavonoid molecule produced fromA. sativum isolate. Treatment with DATS hindered SGC-7901cell growth by inducing apoptosis and amplifying the MAPKroute by phosphorylating JNK, ERK, and p38. It also inhibitedinvasiveness by attenuating the utterances of the MMP9 and Ecadherin proteins, induce cell death and amplifies the MAPKroute by initiating JNK, ERK, and p38. Furthermore, DATStherapy increased cytokine release, such as TNF- and IFN-,which promoted the inflammatory system of the host in cancercare (28).Gastric cancer chemoprevention by allicinAllicin, a component of A. sativum, was found to be effectiveagainst stomach cancer, the fifth most common cancer in theworld. For a long time, the mode of action was unknown.Allicin functions by halting the cell cycle during the G2/M phaseand apoptosis in gastric tumor cells, while normal stomachcells remain unaffected, according to numerous investigations.Furthermore, even in the scientific results, allicin-mediatedinhibition of stomach tumorigenesis can be seen. TGF-alpha(TGF-) and its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) are both inhibited by allicin (EGFR). This causes cyclinE and cyclin D1 to be down-regulated, which can cause cellsin the G2 phase to enter the M phase. Allicin can cause DNAdamage by causing reactive oxygen species (ROS), resultingin phosphorylated P53 and P21 proteins. P21 then inhibitsthe cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6)-cyclin D complex,causing the cell to enter G2/M arrest.Furthermore, the P21 polypeptide can block the P21-CDK2 and P21-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)assemblages, causing the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex to diminishand the G2/M cell stage to be arrested. The particle\u2019s lipid-soluble nature enables it to simply transfer across cellularbarriers. Allicin significantly lowers the potential of the exteriormitochondrial membrane. Elevation in the proportion of pro-apoptotic polypeptide associated with BCL2 (BAX) to anti-apoptotic protein of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) caused byallicin may promote cell death via the mitochondrial route.A greater BAX/BCL2 ratio causes cytochrome c to be releasedinto the cytoplasm, accompanied by caspase-9 involvement.First, caspase-3 is triggered which results in poly ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) and apoptosis-inducing polymerase (AIP)activation. Intrinsic stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated kinaseor p38 MAPK activity was greater in allicin-induced gastrictumor cells. The synthesis of the Fas membrane-spanningpeptide and P53 may be increased if p38 MAPK is increased.The Fas protein is part of the tumor necrosis factor or TNFreceptor superfamily and contains 3 domains (extracellular,cytoplasmic, and transmembrane). The association of Fas\u2019cysteine-rich signal peptide with the Fas ligand (FasL) is a criticalregulator of tumor growth (29). Caspase-8 is activated as a resultof the interaction and can stimulate two separate apoptosismechanisms. Caspases-8 trigger caspase-3 and caspase-7 in themitochondrial independent route to trigger apoptosis. Caspase-8 is responsible for the liberation of Cyt c from mitochondriain the mitochondrial-dependent route (30). Allicin can alsoresult in cell death through a process devoid of caspases. Inthis route, mitochondria generate apoptosis effectors such asapoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G. (EndoG)which is the coactivator of AIF. EndoG and AIF are thenteleported to the nuclei, where they lead to cell death throughbreaks in the nuclear material strands. Furthermore, allicin cancause apoptotic cell death by boosting unbound Ca2+ cationconcentrations and inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) strain(Figure 3) (29).Antimicrobial activityThe antibacterial activities of Allium sativum are extensive.Garlic essential oil [rich in diallyl monosulfide, diallyl disulfide(DADS), diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide] extracted fromraw bulbs had a good antibacterial action against Pseudomonasaeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Theresults suggest that the presence of the allyl group is essentialfor the antimicrobial property of such sulfide derivatives foundin Allium (31). Additional studies have demonstrated thatwatery bulb infusion has high antibacterial efficacy againstBacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans due to disfunctionin phospholipid bilayer synthesis by the activity of allicin(6). Garlic essential oil suppresses the fungal pathogenPenicillium funiculosum, presumably by infiltrating membranesand compartments, disrupting the cytoskeleton, and causingcytoplasmic and biomolecules leaks. In addition, proteomicanalysis revealed the ability of garlic oil to increase ordecrease the expression of few major proteins in relationto physiological metabolism (32). The antimicrobial effect ofAustralian garlic methanol and aqueous clove formulationswas also described on Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus,Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Theidentification and quantification of pharmacologically potentcompounds was done using ultra-high performance liquidchromatography with mass spectrometry and photodiode arraydetection (UHPLC-PDA-MS) and a correlation assessmentwas performed between the compounds and antioxidant andantimicrobial properties (33).Antidiabetic activityAccording to a research article, due to enhanced insulin-like efficacy, the antidiabetic behavior of A. sativum ethyl etherextract (at 0.0025 g/kg) was investigated in alloxan-induceddiabetic rodents. The parietal cells of the pancreas are stimulatedby ingestion of ethanol excerpt, pulp, and oil. Allicin boostedliver metabolism and pancreatic \u03b2 cell insulin response (34).Another investigation found that 3 progressive doses of agedFrontiers in Nutrition 10 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 11Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554FIGURE 3Allicin-mediated apoptosis signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells.

This figure was prepared with BioRender.com.AE extracts have hypoglycemic activities in rats treated withstreptozotocin. Diabetic rats were divided into two groups:control diabetics (CD), which served as negative control, andAGE-treated diabetics (AGE-D). AGE-Ds were classified into 3groups and given AGE at 600, 300, and 100 mg/kg every day fora period of 2 months, as well as a normal control group (CN)which was the positive control for comparison. CD rodentshad higher sugar levels (almost four times), twice the amountof serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and erythrocyte glycosylatedhemoglobin, and thrice the amount of kidney and liver fatty acidoxidation, compared to the CN cohort. In the streptozotocin-treated diabetic group, the findings revealed that AGE had adosage-dependent mitigative effect on hyperglycemia markers(35). In prediabetic expectant mothers, Faroughi et al. (36)evaluated the effects of the A. sativum tablet on the primaryoutcomes of fasting blood sugar or FBS and the recurrence ofsigns of prediabetes, as well as secondary outcomes such ashypertension, infant anthropometric parameters, and deliverymethod. Throughout 2015\u20132016, 49 mothers with prediabetesat 24\u201328 weeks of gestation were included in the triple-blind,randomly selected controlled study in Tabriz, Iran. The averageconcentration of FBS in the garlic-treated cohort reduced from106.6 (11.1) mg/dL before therapy to 83.6 (6.3) mg/dL after4 weeks and 79.4 (6.1) mg/dL 8 weeks later, according to thefindings. The garlic drug also resulted in a substantial reductionin pre-diabetic signs at 4 weeks after therapy and diastolicarterial tension at 4 and 8 weeks. There was no substantialdifference in systolic pressure between the cohorts at 4 and8 weeks after treatment. As a result, the A. sativum tabletreduced FBS levels, prediabetes indicators, and diastolic BP inthis study (36).Antiviral activityA. sativum has long been traditionally used to cure a varietyof viral illnesses. Garlic isolates or compounds have been shownto have antiviral action in several investigations (Figure 4).Extracts or isolates include chemical constituents that can attackdifferent stages of the viral life cycle. Prevention of viral infectionFrontiers in Nutrition 11 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 12Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554can be as simple as inhibiting the virus\u2019s admission stage.Both encapsulated and non-enveloped pathogens are destroyedby this technique. A. sativum and its potent organosulfurcomponents have been shown to promote antiviral activity byinteracting with components on the exterior of the virion. Thisresults in partial inhibition or complete blocking of the virusentry step (3). The aqueous extract of A. sativum expressedan effective inhibition of viral infection of influenza A subtypeH1N1 with EC50 = 0.01 mg/ml in the Madin-Darby caninekidney (MDCK) cell line (37). The exact value of EC50 (0.01mg/ml) was observed against Measles morbillivirus in Verocells treated with gold nanoparticles containing aqueous extractsof A. sativum because it causes an obstruction of the viralreceptors, stopping cell adsorption and the start of viral infectionin the host cell (38). Furthermore, garlic extracts inhibited thebinding of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to chick embryocell receptors (39). Quercetin, a flavonoid commonly present infruits and vegetables, including A. sativum, possesses antiviralproperties against influenza virus and enterovirus by affectingviral attachment to the surface of the host cell. Furthermore,organosulfur compounds in garlic such as allicin, ajoene, anddiallyl trisulfide play an important role in the antiviral propertiesof garlic. These substances can prevent a virus from attachingto a host cell, change how the viral genome is translated in thehost cell, and affect viral RNA polymerase, which is requiredfor viral replication. They can also prevent the viral processthat changes the host cell\u2019s signaling pathway, and prevent viralmultiplication (40). Even if the virus enters the host cell, thereare still various steps suitable for its inhibition. One of theserepresents inhibition in the viral replication step. Replicationmay occur in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the host cell.In the current history, numerous investigations have proventhe ability of A. sativum to prevent viral proliferation. Themethanolic and ethanolic garlic extracts revealed inhibitionof viral RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein synthesis activityagainst the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus. This propertymay be attributed to their ability to block viral attachmentand to suppress viral hemagglutinin (HA) (41). Furthermore,the study evaluating the influence of aqueous garlic extractson avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus thatinfects birds of the Coronaviridae family, suggested the potentialof A. sativum to inhibit the viral replication step (42). Themembers of the retrovirus family utilize reverse transcriptase(RT) to convert viral RNA into DNA. As a result, RT suppressionis a major clinical strategy in the treatment of retrovirustransmission (3). The hexane extracts of A. sativum expresseda powerful activity against the RT of human immunodeficiencyvirus 1 (HIV-1) with an IC50 of approximately 64.08 \u00b1 1.09\u00b5g/mL (43). Furthermore, allicin was evaluated in the study torelieve immune dysfunction caused by the reticuloendotheliosisvirus (REV). The study suggests that allicin downregulated theERK/MAPK signaling pathway resulting in inactivation of REVreplication (3, 44).The World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed aworldwide pandemic of COVID-19 on March 11th, 2020,triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Although various studies have beenreported for the treatment of COVID-19, an effective remedyis still missing. However, several herbal or pharmaceuticaldrugs have been reported with possible beneficial effects onCOVID-19. One of them is A. sativum. As mentioned above,aqueous garlic extracts possess an inhibitory effect againstIBV of the Coronaviridae family. Therefore, it is assumedthat it may also be beneficial against other members ofthe virus family, including SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, someconstituents of A. sativum seem to be helpful in reducingviral replication. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in garlic, bearsthe potential to inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2(Mpro), a crucial antiviral target (45). As reported before,quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside was a suppressor of SARS-CoV-1Mpro with IC50 = 42.79 \u00b1 4.97 \u00b5M (46). Furthermore, thereis a high structural similarity of Mpro between SARS-CoV-1 and 2 (\u223c96%). In silico molecular docking of organosulfurcompounds in A. sativum revealed an inhibitory potential ofalliin against Mpro SARS-CoV-2. The results suggested that alliinhas potential antiviral activity against COVID-19 by bindingto Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 (47). On the other hand, after thecoronavirus outbreak, various hoaxes have been posted on theInternet about preventing COVID-19. Some of them arguedthat: \u201ceating garlic prevents from COVID-19\u201d (48). However,the WHO subsequently declared that there is no indication thatgarlic consumption has safeguarded patients from the novelcoronavirus in the recent outbreak. Indeed, to date, no studieshave been reported to confirm the prevention of A. sativumagainst COVID-19. However, there are no doubts about thebeneficial effects of garlic on human health. In addition, studiesrecently reported confirming that despite garlic\u2019s inability toprevent COVID-19, its antiviral activity can play a crucial rolein alleviating patients suffering from COVID-19.Toxicological studiesMany investigations have been conducted on the toxicityassessment of A. sativum in laboratory animals. According toOECD standards 423, research explained the acute toxicity ofA. sativum ethyl acetate concentrates and then determined theLD50 to demonstrate the acceptability of the extract in rodents(49). To test cytotoxic activity, all 3 animals in each set receivedethanolic extract of A. sativum in a solitary administrationof 3, 20, and 50 g/kg of lean mass. For each treatment,effects on body mass, skin tone, salivation, cornea, mucoussystem, drowsiness, tremor, unconsciousness, spasm, malaise,diarrhea, and death were observed after 30 min, 4 h, 24 h,48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks (49). Sections of the lungs, spleen,heart, kidneys, liver, and intestines were viewed during grosspostmortem and microscopy using standard forensic methods.Frontiers in Nutrition 12 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 13Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554FIGURE 4Proposed antiviral effects of A. sativum against (\u2013) ssRNA viruses. This figure depicts the life cycle steps of influenza A with possible inhibition(shown as a red X-shaped symbol) mediated by garlic extracts or its organosulfur constituents. As shown in the figure, A. sativum bears potentialfor the prevention of viral penetration into the host membrane, virus uncoating associated with the release of viral genetic material into thecytoplasm, conversion of viral (\u2013) ssRNA to viral (+) ssRNA, replication of the viral RNA, virus assembly and release (3). Figure made usingBioRender.com.The rodents did not die as a consequence of the dose increaseand there was no significant change in any of the criteria usedfor general post mortem and histopathological alteration. As aresult, the extract is fine for humans to consume (49). Anotherinvestigation looked at whether A. sativum preparations hada suppressive effect on lead nitrate poisoning. Their potentialto eliminate free radicals and avoid GSH deficiency coulddescribe the function of garlic organosulfur compounds inreducing Pb(NO3)2 poisoning (50). Total erythrocyte count,hemoglobin concentration, total leukocyte count, lymphocyteand monocyte percentage all decreased significantly afterchronic consumption of lead nitrate. In the renal and centralnervous system, the intake of lead nitrate resulted in anincrease in the levels of reactive components of thiobarbituricacid, as well as a reduction in glutathione peroxidase levelsand antioxidant molecules such as superoxide dismutase andcatalase. Nitrate aids lower peptide levels, whereas cholesteroland lead burden increase exponentially in lead-exposed mice,resulting in decreased plaque count, immunoglobulin level,phagocytic index, and macrophage viability (50). Orally ingestedextracts of A. sativum by exposed groups to Pb(NO3)2, on theother hand, may be a preventive strategy against heavy metaltoxicity (50). In cultivated Vero cells, Abid-Essefi et al. (51)explored the role of an aqueous extract of A. sativum (AEA) vs.zearalenone (ZEN) mediated lethality, reactive oxygen species(ROS), and genomic instability. The findings revealed that ZENcaused several harmful consequences and major changes in thebody, which were regulated through the oxidative stress system.Administration with the smallest amount of AEA (250 g/ml) incombination with ZEN resulted in a considerable decrease inZEN-induced impairments for each marker evaluated, as wellas a notable fall in DNA disintegration. As a result, AEA canassist guards against ZEN risks. The great potential of AEA tocompensate for the inflammatory process generated by ZENis probably responsible for its preventive action (51). Manyresearch has suggested that garlic could be used as a foodadditive for people who are not protected from ecological toxins.Irkin et al. (52) studied the effects of dietary garlic granules onFrontiers in Nutrition 13 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 14Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554young European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). For 2 months,the fish received enhanced meals with A. sativum powder atconcentrations of 0 (control), 2 percent, 4 percent, or 6 percent.The RBC count, hemoglobin level, amount of hemoglobinand mean corpuscular hemoglobin in treated fish at dietaryincorporation stages of 4 and 6% were considerably less thanbaseline data after this study. In contrast to the reference cohort,serum sugar levels in fish supplemented with garlic powderwere considerably lower, and cholesterol values in the treatmentgroups of 6 and 2% were smaller than those of the controlgroup. As a consequence, it is recommended that garlic powderfortification in the diets of juvenile fish not surpass 2%. As aresult, this experiment concluded that nutritional garlic powderis critical to improving the physiological and hematological stateof immune improvements in young sea bass (52).Clinical studiesA. sativum preparations are used in drug testing to alleviatea variety of human disorders. The bulbs have been usedsuccessfully as nutrition and treatment in human societies sinceantiquity. The possible hypoglycemic benefits of A. sativum inpatients with type 2 diabetes were examined by Ashraf et al.(53). The purpose of this study was to compare the impactof garlic pills exposure to routine anti-diabetic analyzes onglucose levels in 60 confirmed type 2 diabetic patients withfasting blood glucose levels above 126 mg/dl. Participants wereplaced into two categories. Serum triglycerides and fasting bloodglucose were measured at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Compared togroup 2, group 1 reported a substantial reduction in fastingblood glucose at week 24. A mixture of A. sativum withtraditional anti-diabetic medication improved glucose controland hypocholesterolemic action, according to this research.Garlic\u2019s antilipidemic effects are thought to be caused by allicin\u2019sability to inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, whichlowers LDL-C levels as well as total cholesterol (53). Sukandaret al. (54) investigated the efficacy and tolerability of combiningcurcumin and A. sativum powder as an antidiabetic andhypocholesterolemic treatment for type 2 diabetes-dyslipidemia.3 replicates were calculated which were 1.2, 1.6, and 2.4g, respectively. The garlic-curcuma mixture was observed tolower glucose concentration and HbA1C while also improvingdyslipidemia. The 2.4 g dose was found to reduce fasting glucose,glucose levels two hours after lunch, lipid profile, HbA1C, LDLs,cholesterol, and body mass index and increased HDLs greaterthan the other two prescriptions (54). The benefits of A. sativumsupplementation on serum concentrations of certain markersof inflammation, somatic manifestations, and exhaustion infemales with chronic rheumatoid arthritis or RA were studiedby Moosavian et al. (55). In this investigation, a double-blind,placebo-controlled, randomized experiment was used. A groupof 70 women with RA were randomly classified into two partsfor 8 weeks, where the treatment group received 1,000 mgof A. sativum and the control team received a placebo (55).After therapy, the bioavailability of the C-reactive peptide (CRP)and TNF (TNF-a) was found to be considerably lower in thegarlic cohort compared to the placebo category. Additionally,relative to the placebo group, pain severity, sensitive joint tally,disease activity score, and exhaustion were considerably lower,and the number of enlarged joints was markedly smaller inthe garlic unit, but nothing of this type was demonstratedin the placebo. The result showed that garlic improved theinflammatory mediators like serum level of CRP and TNF-a,though there was no change in erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) (55).DiscussionA. sativum was found to have a spectrum of therapeuticbenefits in this investigation, including antibacterial,cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, andantispasmodic activities, among others. The most essentialcomponents of A. sativum are organosulfur molecules, whichare responsible for most of their medicinal uses. allyl methylsulfide, Allicin, ajoene, and DTS are the primary physiologicallyactive chemicals responsible for the antibacterial, antifungal,antiviral, and antiprotozoal effects of A. sativum, respectively(1). The main ingredient of garlic, allicin, can cause stomachdisturbances, particularly when taken in large doses. Mostcardiac investigations have focused on triglycerides, LDL,cholesterol level, HDL, and arteriosclerosis (56). Accordingto suggestions, A. sativum lowers LDL and triglycerideconcentrations in people with dyslipidemia (56). Consumptionof A. sativum reduces triglyceride levels, which may help slowthe progression of hypertension. In addition to considerablestudies, its antidiabetic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory,and antioxidant effects have been linked in various models.Several investigations have looked into the antitumor andanticarcinogenic properties of A. sativum and its componentsin vitro and in animal experiments. According to the findings,A. sativum encompasses a set of crucially significant compoundswith anticancer and chemopreventive activities. Garlic includesvarious physiologically and pharmacologically importantcomponents, according to clinical and scientific research. Forcardiac, hyperglycemia, rheumatism, gastrointestinal disorders,colitis, liver disorders, bloating, diarrhea, bronchitis, sensoryloss, hypertension, asthma, and other ailments, these are vitalfor health. Several investigations are underway throughoutthe world to make efficient and unscented garlic formulationsand identify bioactive constituents that may have medicinalvalue (57\u201359). However, the extraction, production, molecular,physicochemical and structural properties and structure\u2013activity relationships of garlic compounds (60\u201364) are beyondthe scope of the present review. The metabolic processes ofFrontiers in Nutrition 14 frontiersin.orgfnut-09-929554 October 21, 2022 Time: 17:59 # 15Tudu et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.929554ingested garlic constituents (as food or supplements), theirmechanisms of action in healthy humans have not been detailedwell. Besides structure-bioactivity relationships remain unclearin many pharmacological attributes.ConclusionFor centuries, A. sativum has been widely consumed asa culinary and therapeutic herb as protective and curativeagents. It contains essential minerals, vitamins, and proteinand is widely used as a spice or condiment in continentalcooking. In addition, this plant has various potentialpharmacological activities against various diseases anddisorders owing to its potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatoryand immunomodulatory properties. Based on preclinicalstudies, A. sativum compounds especially the sulfur-containingcompounds, some flavonoids and polyphenols may helptreat certain human conditions, particularly those related tocancer and cardiovascular disease. The roles of A. sativumand the preparations of A. sativum in human health will helpto benefit from additional well-designed human studies andvarious human diseases that carefully characterize the garlicinterferences used and examine possible differential effectsin several human populations. This research also looked atthe key ingredients of the plant, such as sulfur-containingchemicals. Many significant advances have been found in thephytochemistry and related medicinal properties of A. sativum;data regarding clinical aspects and impact on human health-related properties are acceptable. Therefore, it is inferred thatA. sativum is a fantastic seasoning that needs to be handledwith prudence to fully benefit from its immense medicinalbenefits, taking into account that misapplication may result inunintended consequences.Author contributionsCT, TD, MG, PB, DS, PO, NJ, MK, Radha, JP, JMP, andAD contributed to the concept, literature mining, writing, andmethodology of the review, provided critical feedback, andcritically revised the manuscript.
