Minzu University of China, Beijing, ChinaCynoglossum amabile, a member of the Boraginaceae family, is a well-knowntraditional Chinese medicine and ethnomedicine known as Daotihu. Despiteseveral studies confirming the presence of bioactive pyrrolizidine alkaloids suchas amabiline, ambelline, echinatine, europine, and others in C. amabile, there hasbeen no comprehensive review of its traditional uses, phytochemistry, andpharmacology thus far. This review was conducted by thoroughly examiningthe literature and analyzing network databases. It covers various aspects of C.amabile, including botanical characteristics, geographical distribution, traditionalapplications, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, toxicology, and clinicalapplications. The results have shown that C. amabile has been traditionally usedfor medicinal, edible, and ornamental purposes in China for many centuries. Thewhole plant, root, and leaf of C. amabile are used by different ethnic groups, suchas Lisu, Bai, Naxi, Yi, Jinuo, and Han, to treat malaria, hepatitis, dysentery,leucorrhea, tuberculosis cough, fracture, joint dislocation, trauma bleeding,and skin carbuncle abscess. A total of 47 chemical components, includingalkaloids (pyrrolizidine alkaloids, PAs), sterols, organic acids, and saccharides,were isolated from C. amabile. Pharmacological studies show that the chemicalextracts of C. amabile possess various biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, cardiovascular effects, ganglionicaction, and acetylcholinesterase inhibition. However, it is important to notethat C. amabile exhibits hepatotoxicity, with its toxicity being linked to itsprimary PAs components. Although preliminary studies suggest potentialapplications in the treatment of prostate diseases and alopecia, furtherresearch is needed to validate these clinical uses. Our review highlights thetraditional uses, phytochemistry, biological activity, toxicity, and clinicalapplications of C. amabile. It emphasizes the essential guiding role of theindigenous medicinal knowledge system in developing new drugs. Previousstudies have shown that the phytochemical and pharmacologicalcharacteristics of C. amabile are significantly related to its traditional medicinalpractices.

(Boraginaceae) is a cosmopolitan genuscomprising 75 species. In China, there are 10 species and twovarieties of Cynoglossum, primarily distributed in regions such asYunnan, western Guizhou, southwestern to southeastern Tibet,Western Sichuan, and southern Gansu. Cynoglossum iscommonly found in hillsides, grasslands, marginal lands,roadsides, and the edges of coniferous forests, typically ataltitudes ranging from 1250 to 4565 m above sea level (https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30003351-2,accessed on 25 November 2023). Most of the species within theCynoglossum genus are known for their richness in pyrrolizidinealkaloids (PAs), some of which are recognized as important planthepatotoxic components (Stegelmeier, 2011; Damianakos et al.,2013; Damianakos et al., 2016). PAs also constitute the primarysources of Cynoglossum\u2019s pharmacological activities (Fayed, 2021;Vrieling, 2021). Despite its medicinal potential, the value ofCynoglossum in traditional medicine has been largely overlooked.This is due to incidents of poisoning resulting from accidentalingestion of Cynoglossum or its related components (Mudge et al., 2015; Lorena et al., 2016), which have led to its classification as aharmful weed in many countries (Stegelmeier et al., 2009). However,in China, Cynoglossum plants hold significant ethnobotanical valueand have been utilized for food, ornaments, and medicinal purposes(Xu and Zhang, 2009; Zhang et al., 2014). China boasts a wealth ofCynoglossum resources, with many species having a long history ofuse in traditional medicines among ethnic communities. A notableexample is Cynoglossum amabile Stapf et Drumm.Cynoglossum amabile, known by various names in Mandarin,such as Daotihu (\u5012\u63d0\u58f6), Lanbuqun (\u84dd\u5e03\u88d9), Jizhuashen (\u9e21\u722a\u53c2), Lanhuashen (\u84dd\u82b1\u53c2), Goushihua (\u72d7\u5c4e\u82b1), Lanluhu (\u62e6\u8def\u864e), Yibazhua (\u4e00\u628a\u6293), is a traditional medicine employed bythe Buyi, Achang, Bai, Jinuo, and other ethnic groups in China(Jia and Li, 2005). According to records in Chinese MateriaMedica, An Illustrated Book of Plants, Tianbao MateriaMedica, and Materia Medica of Southern Yunnan, C. amabileis characterized by its bitter taste and cool nature. It is creditedwith properties such as clearing heat and dampness, alleviatingfatigue, staunching bleeding, relieving cough, and providinganalgesic effects. It can be administered either alone or as acomponent in folk traditional medical practices. When takenorally, C. amabile is utilized in the treatment of conditions likeacute nephritis, periodontitis, hepatitis, irregular menstruation,abnormal leucorrhea, edema, acute mandibular lymphadenitis,and angina pectoris. For external applications, it is effective in thetreatment of sores, boils, carbuncles, poisonous snake bites, andbruise injuries (Wu, 1963; Lan, 1975; Editorial Board of ChineseMateria Medica, Traditional Chinese Medicine Administrationof China, 1998; Gong et al., 2001).However, there is currently no up-to-date review available onthe traditional utilization, phytochemistry, pharmacology,toxicology, or clinical applications of C. amabile. This gap inknowledge restricts the safe use of C. amabile in clinicalmedication, quality assessment, and resource development. Tofurther promote comprehensive research, development, andutilization of C. amabile, this paper aims to consolidateinformation on its traditional use, chemical composition,pharmacological activities, toxicological effects, and clinicalapplications. This endeavor is intended to enhance the safety ofrelated medications and provide a scientific foundation for therational and correct utilization of plants with potential liver toxicity.2 MethodologyKeywords, including Cynoglossum amabile, Daotihu,Goushihua, Lanbuqun, and Jizhuashen, were used to searchrelated literature and data through digital resources and paper-based materials. The earliest available documents were published in1960, while the latest was published in August 2023. Thesedocuments discussed the traditional utilization, phytochemicalconstituents, pharmacological activities, and safety of C. amabile.Much of the literature research was conducted through the followingnine online scientific databases: Google Scholar, SciFinder, Web ofScience, Springer Link, PubMed,Wiley, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, ChinaScience, and Technology Journal Database. The review also includedresults from Ph.D. theses, M. Sc. Dissertations, online botanicaldatabases, and relevant conference proceedings written in Englishand Chinese.3 Botanical description and geographicdistributionCynoglossum amabile is a perennial herb that reaches a height of15\u201360 cm. Its stems are either single or form several clusters, denselycovered in appressed pubescence. Basal leaves have long petioles andare oblong-lanceolate or lanceolate, measuring 5\u201320 cm in length(including petioles) and 1.5\u20134 cm in width, occasionally reaching5 cm, with dense pubescence on both surfaces. Stem leaves areoblong or lanceolate, sessile, 2\u20137 cm long, and exhibit veryprominent lateral veins. The inflorescence is acutely branched,densely branched, extending straight upward and clustered into apanicle, without bracts. Pedicels are 2\u20133 mm long, slightly longer infruit. The calyx is 2.5\u20133.5 mm long, densely pubescent on theoutside, with ovate or oblong lobes ending in pointed tips. Thecorolla is typically blue with sparse white markings, measuring5\u20136 mm in length and 8\u201310 mm in diameter at the base. Its lobesare round, about 2.5 mm long, with distinct reticulate veins, and theFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283throat features five trapezoidal appendages, each around 1 mm inlength. Filaments are approximately 0.5 mm long, inserted in themiddle of the corolla tube, and the anthers are oblong, roughly 1 mmlong. The style is linear-cylindrical, nearly as long as the calyx orshorter. The nutlets are ovate, 3\u20134 mm long, slightly concave on theback, densely covered with anchor-like spines, and have anchor-likespines along the margin at the base. They may have narrow or widewing-like edges and a triangular insertion surface above the middleof the ventral surface (Figure 1). The flowering and fruiting periodspans from May to September (source: http://www.iplant.cn/info/Cynoglossum%20amabile?t=foc, accessed on 20 July 2023).Cynoglossum amabile is shade-tolerant and often blooms underconditions of sufficient sunshine. It thrives in environments withfertile soil and good drainage. The suitable temperature range for itsgrowth is 18\u00b0C\u201320\u00b0C, and it is not tolerant of high temperatures.While native to China, C. amabile has been widely introduced inCentral America and has reports of growth in northeastern NorthAmerica, Kenya, and Tanzania. Nowadays, it is cultivated andnaturalized in many parts of the world (source: http://www.iplant.cn/info/Cynoglossum%20amabile?t=foc, accessed on7 August 2023).4 Traditional usesThe flowers of Cynoglossum amabile bloom from late spring toearly summer. They are blue in color and have an elegant andpleasing appearance. These flowers bear a resemblance to the\u201cforget-me-not\u201d (Myosotis alpestris F. W. Schmidt) and hold highornamental value. They are suitable not only for combined pottedplants and garden settings but also for enhancing the aesthetics ofrocks, lawns, and garden pathways. In Yunnan, China, some ethniccommunities cultivate C. amabile along fences forornamental purposes.In Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China, the Yi peopleregard C. amabile as a wild edible plant and harvest its roots for food.According to Sichuan Zhong Yao Zhi, C. amabile possessessignificant dietary therapy value. Residents in Sichuan often stewmeat with the entire plant, which has a positive effect on treatingconditions such as cough-induced aphonia and spitting blood(Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1960; Wang et al., 2020).The primary value of C. amabile lies in its medicinalapplications. The earliest records of its medicinal value can befound in \u201cDian Nan Ben Cao\u201d (AD 1436), followed by mentionsin ancient texts such as \u201cBen Cao Gang Mu Shi Yi\u201d (AD 1765) and\u201cZhi WuMing Shi Tu Kao\u201d (AD 1848) (Lan, 1975; Jia and Li, 2005).\u201cDian Nan Ben Cao\u201d states that one name for C. amabile is Daotihu,also known as Yibazhua, Lanbuqun, Lanhuashen, and Goushihua,among others. It promotes urination, reduces edema, clears stomachheat, treats jaundice, relieves liver pain, and addresses seven types ofhernia pain. Apart from the common blue-flowered C. amabile, thebook mentions two other varieties with white and red flowers. Thewhite-flowered variety was later identified as Cynoglossum amabileStapf et Drumm f. eucanthum, and the red-flowered one asCynoglossum amabile Stapf et Drumm f. ruberum. All threevarieties can be used medicinally, with the blue-flowered onebeing the most commonly utilized (Lan, 1975).Currently, many ethnic groups in China still maintain thetraditional practice of using C. amabile for medicinal purposes(Geng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; ZhangFIGURE 1(A) Wild growth environment and plant morphology of Cynoglossum amabile. (B) Flowers. (C) Leaves. (D) Roots. (E) Seeds.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283et al., 2022). As depicted in Table 1, different parts of C. amabile,including the whole plant, roots, and leaves, are utilized for varioushealth conditions. The entire plant is typically collected in summer,then washed and dried or used fresh. When mashed and appliedexternally, the fresh plant can treat traumatic bleeding, fractures,joint dislocations, carbuncle, and abscess.When the sun-dried wholeplant is decocted and ingested, it has effects such as clearing heat,removing dampness, dispersing blood stasis, stopping bleeding, andrelieving cough. Roots are typically gathered in autumn, washed,sliced, and dried. They are commonly employed to addressconditions like bleeding due to external injury, hepatitis, hernia,dysentery, malaria, and stranguria. Leaves are effective against arange of ailments, including various types of hernia pain, smallbowel pain, bladder pain, and renal cysts (Jia and Li, 2005).5 PhytochemistryResearch on the chemical components of Cynoglossum amabilecan be primarily divided into two aspects: isolation andidentification. The methods for isolating and identifying thesecomponents include ethanol extraction, PLC-MS/MS, DOLPA/AOT-UPLC, and IR/MS/NMR (Culvenor and Smith, 1967;Kedzierski and Buhler, 1986; Zhang et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2016;Fan et al., 2018). Presently, a total of 47 compounds have beenidentified in the leaves, flowers, seeds, and whole plants ofC. amabile(Table 2). These 47 compounds encompass alkaloids, sterols,organic acids, amino acids, saccharides, triterpenoids, fatty acids,furans, and other categories.5.1 AlkaloidsAlkaloids are the primary constituents of Cynoglossum, knownfor their diverse pharmacological and toxicological activities, such asanti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, and hepatotoxic effects(Berkov et al., 2020; Rasouli et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021).Similar to other Cynoglossum plants, C. amabile employs alkaloidaccumulation as its primary chemical defense mechanism (El-Shazlyet al., 2001; Fr\u00f6lich et al., 2007; Damianakos et al., 2016).A total of 12 alkaloids have been isolated and identified from C.amabile. For instance, Culvenor and Smith utilized paperchromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gaschromatography to analyze dried C. amabile (163 g). Theydetermined that it contained 0.53% N-oxide and 0.35% free base.The total crude base (380 mg) exhibited RF (paper) of 0.36, 0.40; RF(TLC) of 0.10, 0.30; and RT of 3.6. Subsequently, the crude baseunderwent countercurrent distribution between 20 mL phases ofCHCl3 and potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.7. After 50 transfers,base (184 mg) was isolated from tubes 20\u201332, with an RF (TLC) of0.10, yielding amabiline with RF (paper) of 0.40 and an RF (TLC) of0.10. From tubes 38\u201350, base (115 mg) with an RF (TLC) of 0.28 wasTABLE 1 The traditional medicinal practice of Chinese ethnic groups for Cynoglossum amabile.EthnicgroupsLocal name UsedpartMedicinal efficacy ReferencesYi A nu de niang WholeplantRheumatism, tingling in hands and feet, irregular menses, infertility Gao et al.

Echinatine formed picrolonate yellowrosettes from ethanol, with a melting point of 209\u00b0C\u2013209.5 \u00b0C(decomposition), remaining unchanged upon admixture withechinatine picrolonate (Found: C, 52.9; H, 6.0; N, 12.5.C15H25N05, C10HgN405 requires C, 53.3; H, 5.9; N, 12.4%)(Culvenor and Smith, 1967). Amabiline and Echinatine are bothPAs (pyrrolizidine alkaloids).Additionally, the PAs inC. amabile include heliosupine, supinine,and lasiocarpine. These alkaloids share a fundamental structure of 7-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-6,7-dihydro-5h-pyrrolizidine, as depictedTABLE 2 (Continued) Chemical constituents isolated and identified from Cynoglossum amabile.No. CAS name Parts ofplantDetectmethodType References35 7776\u201348-9 L-fructose seed \u201436 10030\u201385-0L (+)-Rhamnose monohydrate seed \u201437 5989\u201381-1 \u03b1-D-Lactose monohydrate seed \u201438 508\u201302-1 Oleanolic acid whole plant NMR Triterpenoids Zhang, (2013)40 1883\u201375-6 [5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-yl]methanolwhole plant NMR Furans Xu et al.

Otheralkaloids found in C. amabile comprise heliotridine, heliotrine,rindeline, supinidine, and viridiflorine (Culvenor and Smith, 1967;El-Shazly et al., 1996; Fan et al., 2018).5.2 SterolsSterols are steroids containing hydroxyl groups. Their structureis akin to cholesterol but with a different side chain (Zhu et al., 2009;Melo et al., 2015; He et al., 2018). Most sterols possess double bondsat C-5, with the hydroxyl group at C-3 serving as an importantfunctional group, enabling the formation of various derivatives (Dasand Kumar, 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2022). When thedouble bond in a sterol is saturated, it is referred to as a stanol, andwhen esterified, it becomes a sterol ester (Ketom\u00e4ki et al., 2003;O\u2019Neill et al., 2005). Sterols can be categorized as phytosterols,animal sterols, and fungal sterols based on their sources. Commonphytosterols include sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol.Cholesterol is the primary animal sterol, while ergosterol isprevalent in fungi, primarily in molds and mushrooms (Martiniet al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). The diverse numberof methyl groups attached to C-4, the length of the side chain on C-11, and the number and location of double bonds contribute to thegreater diversity of phytosterols compared to the other two steroltypes (Kritchevsky and Chen, 2005; Marangoni and Poli, 2010).Sterols have many different biological functions. For example,animal sterols can be used as components of cell membranes andconstitute adrenocortical hormones and sex hormones (Goldsteinet al., 2006; Mati\u0107 et al., 2014). Many phytosterols also have strongpharmacological or toxicological effects, such as digitalis andouabain, which can enhance the contraction of the myocardiumand be good drugs for the treatment of heart failure (Marangoni andPoli, 2010; Garcia et al., 2015; Ravi et al., 2020).At present, there are four sterols identified from C. amabile, asshown in Figure 3, which are eleutheroside A, lupeol, stigmasterol,and \u03b2-sitosterol (Xu et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009; Zhang, 2013). Xuet al. processed 3 kg of dried C. amabile by grinding them intopowder. The coarse powder underwent three reflux extractions with95% ethanol, each lasting 2 h. The resulting extracts were combined,concentrated, and sequentially extracted with petroleum ether (PE),chloroform, and ethyl acetate (EA). The PE fraction (19 g) wasmixed with 200\u2013300 mesh silica gel and applied to a column. Elutionwas performed using different ratios of PE and EA in TLC. Fractionswith similar characteristics were combined, underwentrecrystallization purification, and Eleutheroside A (50 mg) wasobtained through EA elution. Stigmasterol (40 mg) was obtainedthrough gradient elution with PE: EA (100:3) (Xu et al., 2008).Zhang conducted a similar process involving 30 kg of dried C.amabile. The material was ground into powder, and 3 kg of theresulting powder was extracted using 95% ethanol reflux. Theextract was dispersed in water and successively extracted withPE, chloroform, EA, and n-butanol. The PE, chloroform, andn-butanol fractions were separated and identified using variouschromatographic methods, including silica gel, MCI, glucose gelLH-20, and reverse-phase silica gel Rp-18, supplemented byFIGURE 3Structures of sterols from Cynoglossum amabile. (A) Eleutheroside A, (B) Lupeol, (C) Stigmasterol, (D) \u03b2-sitosterol.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283recrystallization for purification. In total, 12 monomeric compoundswere isolated and identified. Through physical and spectral analyses,as well as TLC comparison with standard substances, compoundsseven and eight were identified as lupeol (77 mg) and \u03b2-sitosterol(254 mg), respectively (Zhang, 2013).5.3 Organic acidsOrganic acids are compounds containing carboxyl groupswithin their molecules, encompassing carboxylic acids and theirsubstituted counterparts. They naturally exist in animals and plantsas free forms, salts, or esters (Bae and Lee, 2015; Ghislain et al., 2021;Huang et al., 2021). In a broader context, organic acids cover a widerange of compounds, including fatty acids or esters, phenolic acidsor esters, amino acids or esters, and more. According to reportedcompounds, C. amabile contains 13 types of organic acids, includingamino acids, phenolic acids, and fatty acids (Figure 4).Amino acids are primarily found in the seeds of C. amabile,including D-alanine, DL proline, Glycine, L-aspartic acid, L-cystine,L-glutamic acid, L-threonine, and N-carbobenzoxy-dl-leucine(Editorial Committee of Chinese Materia Medica, TraditionalChinese Medicine Administration of China, 1998), whilephenolic acids and fatty acids are present throughout the entireplant. Among fatty acids, three types are identified: docosanoic acid,pentadecanoic acid, and octacosanoic acid. Salicylic acid andprotocatechuic acid are the primary phenolic acids. Asmentioned above, the components found in C. amabile by Xuet al. also include octacosanoic acid (200 mg). The 12 monomericcompounds separated and extracted from C. amabile by Zhanginclude docosanoic acid (11 mg), pentadecanoic acid (23 mg), andprotocatechuic acid (18 mg) (Xu et al., 2008; Zhang, 2013). It isworth noting that these compounds are essential in organicsynthesis and have widespread applications in pharmaceuticals,pesticides, rubber, dyes, food, and the fragrance industry,particularly in daily chemical products (Spepi et al., 2016; Tanet al., 2020).5.4 Saccharides and othersStructurally, saccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketonesand their polymers. They are widely present in plants, serving as vitalcomponents with significant roles in plant physiological andbiochemical processes (Kapaev and Toukach, 2018; Xue et al.,2018; Li et al., 2019). Based on their structural differences,saccharides can be categorized into monosaccharides (such asglucose, fructose, and galactose), disaccharides (including sucrose,maltose, and lactose), and polysaccharides (such as starch andglycogen). Currently, nine saccharides have been isolated andidentified from C. amabile seeds, encompassing bothmonosaccharides and polysaccharides (Editorial Board of ChineseMateria Medica, Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration ofChina, 1998; Alee et al., 2021; Debras et al., 2021) (Figure 5).Furthermore, C. amabile contains triterpenoid components,such as oleanolic acid, furan components [5- (hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl] methanol in the entire plant, anthocyanincomponents like delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside in its flowers, andvarious other components, including viridifloric acid, amabilicacid, and 2\u03b1,3\u03b2,19\u03b1,23-tetrahydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid.Among these, oleanolic acid stands out as an intermediatecompound used in medicine, pesticides, and dyes, with wideFIGURE 4Structures of organic acids or esters from Cynoglossum amabile.

As previously mentioned, C. amabilecontains alkaloids, sterols, organic acids, saccharides, triterpenoids,and various other chemical components. Its primary component isPAs, indicating that this plant holds potential as an ethnomedicinedeserving of significant research. A summary of the biological andpharmacological activities associated with C. amabile is presented inTable 3. Detailed information can be found below.6.1 Anti-inflammatoryTo assess the anti-inflammatory activity of amabilic acidextracted from C. amabile, SD mice were used as the testsubjects. Aspirin served as the positive control, with a dosage of60 mg/kg in the high-dose amabilic acid group and 30 mg/kg in thelow-dose group. After 5 days of continuous intragastricadministration, it was observed that amabilic acid significantlyinhibited mouse auricle swelling caused by xylene (p < 0.01),surpassing the performance of aspirin, even when administeredat half the dosage of aspirin (Xu et al., 2009). Therefore, it is essentialto select an appropriate pharmacological model for furthercompound studies.Echinatine, a primary component of PAs in C. amabile, wasemployed to test its inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasomeactivation in mouse BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and LPS-primed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Thestudy revealed that echinatin exhibited no cytotoxicity at dosesbelow 100 \u03bcM in BMDMs but effectively inhibitedNLRP3 inflammasome by binding to heat-shock protein 90(HSP90), thereby inhibiting its ATPase activity and disruptingthe association between the cochaperone SGT1 and HSP90-NLRP3. Additionally, echinatin potently suppressed caspase-1activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to canonicalNLRP3 stimuli. Furthermore, it demonstrated favorablepharmacological effects on liver inflammation and fibrosis in amouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Thesefindings suggest that echinatin is a broad inhibitor ofNLRP3 inflammasome, capable of suppressing both canonicaland noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Xu et al.,2021). This implies that C. amabile may serve as a promisingcandidate for therapeutic interventions in NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases.6.2 Anti-tumorFollowing the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center(CCNSC) protocols, the tumor-inhibitory properties of echinatine,europine, heliotrine, lasiocarpine, and supinine, the primarycomponents in C. amabile, were assessed. Several tumor modelsincluding adenocarcinoma 755 in mice, lymphoid leukemia L1210,sarcoma 180, Walker 256 (intramuscular) in rats, Walker 256(subcutaneous) in rats, and plasmacytoma one in hamsters wereemployed. Various dosing regimens were applied, ranging from onedose daily for 11 days to one dose daily for 15 days.The results revealed widespread tumor-inhibitory activityamong PAs. The tumors most frequently inhibited were Walker256 (intramuscular) and adenocarcinoma 755. In some cases, theactivity level against the former was very high, requiring heliotrine ata dose level of 125 mg/kg for complete or near-complete tumordestruction. Both heliotrine and lasiocarpine displayed activityagainst sarcoma 180. Lasiocarpine was effective against WalkerFIGURE 5Structures of saccharides from the seeds of Cynoglossum amabile.

Heliotrine exhibited strongactivity against Walker 256 (intramuscular), while lasiocarpineshowed moderate activity, and echinatine and supinine wereessentially inactive. Although the known acute and chroniceffects of PAs do not favor the development of tumor-suppressive drugs in analogs, these results suggest that fortumor-inhibitory activity, an optimum level or set of levels existsTABLE 3 Summary of the pharmacological activities of Cynoglossum amabile.PharmacologicalactivityTestedsubstance/partTested system/organ/cellTested dose Results RefsAnti-inflammatory Amabilic acid SD mice Amabilic acid high dose60 mg/kg, amabilic acidlow dose 30 mg/kgAmabilic acid had an obviousinhibitory effect on mouseauricle swelling induced byxylene (p < 0.01), and the effectwas better than aspirinXu et al.(2009)Echinatine BM-derived macrophages(BMDMs), LPS-primed humanperipheral blood mononuclearcells (hPBMCs),NLRP3 inflammasomeactivation in miceMice that received120 mg/kg dose ofechinatin (3 times higherthan the dose used for theseptic shock experiments)daily for 15 daysEchinatin inhibits nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasomeactivation in both mouse andhuman immune cells.Xu et al.(2021)Anti-tumor Echinatine, europine,heliotrine, lasiocarpine,supinineAdenocarcinoma 755 in mice,lymphoid leukemia L1210,sarcoma 180, Walker 256(intramuscular) in rats, Walker256 (subcutaneous) in rats, andplasmacytoma 1 in hamsters25% increase in survivaltime for leukemia 1210%and 50% inhibition ofkB cell culture at aconcentration of1 mcg/mLTumor-inhibitory activity iswidely exhibited among PAsCulvenorand Smith,(1967)Antimicrobial Four different polarities ofpetroleum ether phase,chloroform phase, ethylacetate phase and waterphase of the C. amabile\u2019saerial part ethanol extractFive bacteria includingEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcusaureus and Pseudomonasaeruginosa, and five plantpathogenic fungi includingBotryosphaeria rhodina,Fusarium oxysporum, Fusariumsolani, Corynespora cassiicolaand Colletotrichum acutatumE. coli: 7.7*106 CFU/mL, B.subtilis: 3.5*106 CFU/mL,P. vulgaris: 1.9*106 CFU/mL, P. aeruginosa:5.5*106 CFU/mL, S.aureus: 4.8 * 106 CFU/mL,aqueous phase (0.19 g/mL), ethyl acetate phase(0.04 g/mL), petroleumether phase (0.28 g/mL)and chloroform phase(0.037 g/mL)C. amabile has certainantibacterial activity, but itsinhibitory effect on variousstrains is differentWang et al.(2014)Against ischemia/reperfusion heartEchinatine Sprague\u2013Dawley rats Echinatin (0.5 and2.5 \u03bcg/mL)Echinatin limited the contents ofCK and LDH, improved the leftventricular developed pressure,reduced the contents ofmalondialdehyde, interleukin-6,and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, andincreased the superoxidedismutase activityTian, et al.(2016)Ganglionic blocking action Heliotrine Adult mongrel dogs (8\u201315 kg),adult guinea pigs of either sex(500g\u20131 kg), albino mice ofeither sex (15\u201330 g)Acute toxicity (24 hmortality) was studied byinjecting graded doses ofheliotrine (100, 200, 300,400 and 500 mg/kg)intraperitoneally in groups(10 per each) of albinomice of either sex(15\u201330 g)Studies with heliotrine revealedthat it selectively reduces theautonomic ganglion stimulanteffects of nicotine, suggestingthat it possesses ganglionblocking activityPandeyet al.

Therefore, it may be possible to usethese components to inhibit mitosis selectively, durably, andcompletely in parenchymal hepatocytes. If this activity canextend to liver cell-derived tumor cells, it holds promise forcomplete liver cancer inhibition and benefits the liver.6.3 AntimicrobialFour different polar fractions of the ethanol extract of C.amabile\u2019s aerial parts were used to investigate their inhibitoryeffects on five bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonasaeruginosa, as well as five plant pathogenic fungi, includingBotryosphaeria rhodina, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani,Corynespora cassiicola, and Colletotrichum acutatum. The resultsdemonstrated that the chloroform fraction had an inhibitory effecton E. coli and P. vulgaris, with a minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC) of 3 mg/mL. The EA fraction displayed inhibitory effects onE. coli, B. subtilis, and P. vulgaris, with an MIC of 2 mg/mL. Theaqueous fraction only exhibited an inhibitory effect on E. coli, withan MIC of 20 mg/mL. The chloroform fraction displayed the mostpotent inhibitory effect on Fusarium solani, with a concentration of50% of maximal effect (EC50) of 1.48 mg/mL. The EA fractiondemonstrated the most potent inhibitory effects on B. rhodinaand C. cassiicola, with EC50 values of 1.78 mg/mL and 0.63 mg/mL, respectively (Wang et al., 2014). These findings indicate that C.amabile possesses certain antibacterial activity, although itsinhibitory effect varies among different strains.However, this experiment only preliminarily conducted in vitrotesting of C. amabile\u2019s whole plant. Further research is needed tounderstand the mechanism of action on bacteria and plantpathogenic fungi through in vivo testing, separation andpurification of effective antibacterial components from differentparts of the plant, and the assessment of changes in theproportion of antibacterial and bacteria-promoting activesubstances.6.4 Cardiovascular effectTo investigate the protective effect of echinatine on myocardialischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, adult Sprague-Dawley ratswere randomly divided into five groups. Myocardial infarct size wasestimated through 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Thecoronary effluent was analyzed for the release of lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) to assess cardiacinjury. Concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were determined, alongwith superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity using ELISA.Additionally, cardiomyocyte apoptosis analysis was conductedwith POD, an in-situ cell death detection kit. The resultsindicated that echinatin (0.5 and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL) pretreatmentenhanced the maximum up/down rate of the left ventricularpressure (\u00b1dp/dtmax), improved heart rate, increased leftventricular developed pressure (LVDP), enhanced coronary flow,and reduced CK and LDH levels in the coronary flow of the treatedgroup compared to the I/R group. Echinatine limited CK and LDHlevels, improved LVDP, reduced MDA, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels, andincreased SOD activity. The infarct size and cell apoptosis in thehearts of the rats in the echinatin-treated group were smaller andlower, respectively, than those in the hearts of the rats in the I/Rcontrol group. Therefore, echinatin exhibits a protective effectagainst I/R-induced myocardial injury (Tian, et al., 2016).This effect of echinatine may be attributed to its antioxidant andanti-inflammatory activities. Researchers have reached a consensusthat oxidative stress can trigger significant myocardial injury afterI/R through certain pathways (Nazari et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015). Inthis experiment, echinatine treatment significantly reduced theMDA content in I/R rats and improved the I/R-induceddeterioration of total antioxidant capacity (SOD activity).Inflammation, which plays a crucial role in many disease states,is associated with enhanced expression of adhesive molecules in thevasculature, leading to the infiltration of larger populations ofneutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from these activated leukocytes can causetissue damage (Varela et al., 2013). The results of this experimentshowed that I/R increased the production of these cytokines, whileechinatine treatment reduced their concentrations. Overall, thisextract may inhibit myocardial I/R injury through its anti-inflammatory activities.6.5 Ganglionic blocking actionHeliotrine is one of the primary PAs found in C. amabile. To testits ganglionic blocking action, adult mongrel dogs (8\u201315 kg) ofeither sex were anesthetized with chloralose (70 mg/kg, i. v.).Drugs were administered through the cannulated femoral vein.The effect of graded doses of the test drug on blood pressure andnictitating membrane responses to nicotine (25 \u03bcg/kg) andadrenaline (10 \u03bcg/kg) was recorded. An interval of 5\u201310 min wasmaintained between two successive drug administrations.Meanwhile, the ED50 of the test drug against nicotine-inducedspasmogenic response was determined on isolated guinea pigileum. The results were compared with pentolinium, a knownganglion blocker. In vivo and in vitro experiments with heliotrinerevealed that it selectively reduces the autonomic ganglion stimulanteffects of nicotine, suggesting that it possesses ganglion blockingactivity. In vitro studies suggest that heliotrine is approximately13 times less potent than pentolinium. Additionally, heliotrine hasneither central nervous system activity nor central muscle blockingeffects and does not improve spasms caused by acetylcholine andbarium chloride. The potentiation of adrenaline-inducedvasopressor and nictitating membrane responses by the testcompound may be caused by decentralization supersensitivity, aphenomenon known to occur after the administration of ganglion-blocking agents (Pandey et al., 1982).6.6 Other crucial activitiesStudies have indicated that cholinergic neurons in the basalforebrain of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) are absent, theFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is increased, and the contentof acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, is decreased. Consequently,targeting AChE and inhibiting its activity is a classic strategy fortreating AD (Ibach and Haen, 2004; Kou et al., 2021). To analyze theinteraction of PAs, such as heliosupine and heliotrine, withacetylcholine-related enzymes (acetylcholinesterase andbutyrylcholinesterase), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), andneuroreceptors (\u03b11-and \u03b12-adrenergic, nicotinergic [nACh],muscarinergic [mACh], and serotonin2 [5-HT2] receptors),testing was conducted. The results indicated that heliosupine andheliotrine displayed significant binding activities to mACh and 5-HT2 receptors, with IC50 values of 390.0 \u03bcM and 52.2 \u03bcM, 77.1 \u03bcMand 535.4 \u03bcM, respectively. This suggests that C. amabile may holdpotential as a therapeutic agent for AD.Furthermore, in an aphid resistance activity test experiment,amabiline was tested against Aphis citricola. The resultsdemonstrated that amabiline exhibited considerable aphicidalactivity, with LD50 values of 67.44 ng/aphid (Yan et al., 2018).Aphids are among the most destructive and economically significantplant pests globally, causing substantial financial losses. Theseresults suggest that C. amabile has the potential to be developedas a biological pesticide to combat the harm caused by aphids.7 ToxicitySince the 1930s, there have been explosive cases or individualcases of human liver poisoning caused by plants containing PAs inJamaica, India, Afghanistan, the United States, Europe, and otherplaces, leading to global concern about its hepatotoxicity (Mathonet al., 2014; Yang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Modern researchindicates that the most basic structural unit of PAs\u2019s toxicity is whenthere are double bonds at one and 2, and at least one hydroxyl groupat seven or nine is esterified. The toxicity of diesters is greater thanthat of monoesters, and macrocyclic diester PAs are more toxic thanopen-chain diesters (Hartmann et al., 1997; Fu et al., 2014). Thepharmacological activity and toxicity of Cynoglossum amabile arederived from a large number of PAs (Yan et al., 2011;Vrieling, 2021).7.1 Hepatic and pulmonary toxicityNumerous experiments and clinical observations have revealedthat the toxicity of PAs often occurs in the liver. Exposure to largeamounts can lead to acute poisoning, characterized by hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) or hepatic sinusoidal obstructionsyndrome (SOS). Long-term ingestion of small amounts of PAsresults in chronic toxicity, manifested as hepatic giant cell formationand hepatic fibrosis (Tang et al., 2007; Tang and Hattori, 2011). PAsundergo metabolic activation by liver P450s, producing pyrrolicmetabolites or \u201cmetabolic pyrroles.\u201d These pyrrolic metabolitesenter the cytoplasm, where they react with essential lifesubstances such as thiol-containing amino acids, small peptides,proteins, enzymes, and RNA. Another portion degrades rapidly,forming a series of secondary toxic metabolites, including tissue-bound pyrroles, glutathione pyrrolic conjugates (e.g., 7-GSH-DHR),and dehydroretronecine (DHR). These reactions lead to continuouspoisoning of liver cells during detoxification, resulting in irreversibleliver cell dysfunction, necrosis, and tissue damage (Han et al., 2011;Yang et al., 2017; Suparmi et al., 2020).The lungs are another important target organ for the toxicity ofcertain PAs, manifesting as pulmonary arterial hypertension andpulmonary veno-occlusive disease. The formation of pyrrolicmetabolites is also implicated in lung toxicity. For example,in vitro experiments show that PAS in rats generates pyrrolic-protein adducts in the liver and lungs. Severe damage occurs inthe pulmonary artery endothelial cells and abnormal proliferation ofpulmonary artery smooth muscle cells when mild liver damage ispresent in rats. These results suggest that a significant portion ofdehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids (DHPAs) transfers from the liver tothe lungs, preferentially inducing lung toxicity (Kempf et al., 2010;Sun et al., 2019; Song et al., 2020). However, the mechanism behindpulmonary toxicity, whether it is related to liver metabolism, andhow pyrrolic metabolites are transported from the liver to the lungsremain unclear (Tang and Hattori, 2011; Nakai et al., 2019).7.2 Genotoxicity and carcinogenicityGenotoxicity refers to the ability of a substance to damage cellularDNA directly or indirectly, causing gene mutations or mutations in thebody, with the potential or tendency to induce mutations andcarcinogenesis. Genotoxic substances have the characteristic ofcausing damage to genetic material even at low concentrations andare highly toxic (Tang and Hattori, 2011; Luckert et al., 2015). Aftermetabolic activation, PAs exhibit various genetic toxicities. Long-termingestion of PAs leads to changes in cell morphology, enlargement ofcell nuclei, loss of cell metabolic function, mitotic inhibition, lipiddegeneration, and cell carcinogenesis. This includes DNA binding,DNA cross-linking, DNA-protein cross-linking, and chromosomalaberrations (Xia et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2015). For example,treatment of P53 knockout mice with different concentrations ofPAs shows dose-dependent promotion of tumor occurrence anddevelopment, primarily manifested as hepatic hemangiosarcomawith accompanying vascular dilation (hepatic peliosis) (Brownet al., 2015).The carcinogenic effect of PAs is related to the formation ofpyrrolic-DNA adducts. PAs and PANOs in rat livers producepyrrolic derivatives that bind to DNA, generating pyrrolic-DNAadducts, potential biomarkers for PAs\u2019 carcinogenicity. The levels ofadduct formation differ for PAs with different structures, with theranking as follows: diester PAs > monoester PAs - diesterPANOs >> non-esterified (Xia et al., 2008).7.3 Toxicity control methodsDue to the complex chemical structure of PAs, removing thesecomponents poses significant challenges, a problem faced by manyherbal medicines containing PAs. Currently, there is no universallyaccepted and determined method to completely removepyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from plants. However, researchindicates that PAs are primarily eliminated through hydrolysisreactions and N-oxidation excretion (Habs et al., 2018). Whenexposure to PAs is low, reduced glutathione can bind with theFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283dehydrogenated metabolites of PAs, preventing the latter fromforming toxic complexes with DNA or proteins, representing themain detoxification pathway for PAs (Yang et al., 2016). In addition,oxidative damage also contributes to the toxicity of PAs (Yang et al.,2016; Habs et al., 2018), so substances with antioxidant propertiesalso have a certain protective and ameliorative effect on thetoxicity of PAs.Currently, many countries or organizations have establishedregulations regarding the widespread presence and harm of PAsin human food and natural medicines (Kempf et al., 2010). Forexample, the World Health Organization (WHO) hasrecommended monitoring the content of PAs in honey anddairy products and issued health and safety guidelines onpyrrolizidine alkaloids in 1989. Dutch authorities stipulatethat the total PAs content in 1 kg or 1 L of herbal products orextracts must not exceed 1 \u03bcg (1 ppb) (Kempf et al., 2010). TheU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits the use ofcomfrey (Symphytum) plants from the Boraginaceae family inthe food processing industry (Tang and Hattori, 2011). Recently,the European Commission has mandated that pyrrolizidinealkaloid components should not be detectable in borage oil(primarily seed oil from Echium plantagineum L. of theBoraginaceae family) used as a food ingredient or additive(with a detection limit of 4 ppb) (Kempf et al., 2010; Tangand Hattori, 2011; Luckert et al., 2015). These regulations areworth considering and learning from when applying andpromoting the use of herbal materials containing PAs, suchas C. amabile, Onosma paniculatum Bur. Et Franch, and Senecioscandens Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don.8 Clinical applicationIn traditional medicine, Cynoglossum amabile is commonly usedby people in Southwest China to treat malaria, hepatitis, dysentery,urinary pain, leucorrhea, tuberculosis, and cough. It is also appliedexternally to treat trauma, bleeding, fractures, and joint dislocations.The researchers are currently actively exploring the clinicalapplications of this herbal medicine.In the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, Xinyihao, acompound preparation composed of C. amabile, possessesfunctions such as promoting blood circulation, removing bloodstasis, strengthening the spleen and Qi, and reducing swellingand pain. It can increase coronary flow, resist coronary spasmscaused by pituitrin, reduce oxygen consumption, and withstandatmospheric and low-pressure hypoxia (Dai, 2015; Li, 2017).According to a Chinese patent report, using C. amabile and itsextracts to treat prostate disease and sexual dysfunction caused byprostate disease offers fast and reliable effects. They can enhance andrepair certain physiological functions of the human body, improvingoverall defense and quality of life (Zhao, 2007a).Cynoglossum amabile extract is used to treat hemorrhoids,constipation, anal prolapse, and other anorectal diseases. Itexhibits rapid onset, a stable effect, improvement and repair ofhuman physiological functions, and increased resistance. It has beenused by nearly 100 patients with an effective rate of about 90%,offering a new option for clinical treatment of these conditions(Zhao, 2016).Additionally, preparations made from C. amabile\u2019s originalmedicinal materials, processed products, or extracts have showna positive effect in treating alopecia, with an effective rate of about85%, especially in cases of androgenic alopecia. After 30 days oftreatment, patients generally experience reduced hair loss. After2\u20133 months of use, atrophic hair follicles begin to repair, new hairgrows in bald areas, and the bald area is gradually covered by newhair. Hair growth and metabolism gradually return to normal(Zhao, 2007b).However, as a toxic plant medicine, there is a far fromsufficient understanding of the clinical research on the use ofC. amabile. Limited patent reports only indicate the potentialfuture applications of this medicine and provide basicformulations and preparation methods, without offeringdetailed clinical research results and relevant parameters. Forthe promotion and application of a medicine, specialized clinicalstudies are indispensable. This includes specifying the types ofclinical studies conducted (open-label, blind, controlled trials,etc.), dosage administration (and whether the extract isstandardized), duration, and study outcomes (the percentageof subjects showing a positive response to the treatment).Other crucial information involves the extract/compoundused, parameters influenced by the extract/compoundadministration, types of compounds that may have therapeuticpotential and their mechanisms of action, and whether registeredsubjects reported any side effects or toxicity.9 ConclusionCynoglossum amabile is commonly used in ethnomedicine inSouthwest China and has a long history of medicinal use. This paperprovides a comprehensive review of the botanical description,geographic distribution, traditional utilization, phytochemistry,pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical applications of C. amabile.The whole plant, roots, and leaves of C. amabile are often utilized asmedicine in folk practices, each exhibiting different efficacies.Phytochemical studies have identified the main chemicalcomponents in C. amabile as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs),sterols, and organic acids or esters. Among these, PAs are themost abundant, and the pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, cardiovascular effects,ganglionic blocking, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, andhepatotoxicity of C. amabile, are primarily attributed to them.The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of PAsare closely linked to their pharmacological effects and toxicitymechanisms.Despite its limited application in clinical settings, there arenumerous research gaps concerning C. amabile. It is crucial toanalyze this plant using innovative technologies and methodologies.For instance, there is insufficient research on the in vivo and ex vivometabolism of PAs in C. amabile, particularly regarding theirpharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, and excretion) inanimals and humans. Pharmacokinetic studies can unveil themetabolic pathways and biological activities of the identifiedcomponents or differential metabolites in the root, stem, leaf,flower, seed, and other parts of C. amabile, thereby establishingthe scientific foundation for its traditional folk use and offeringFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Fan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283guidance for further development and application. Moreover, thepresence of salicylic acid, protocatechuic acid, and oleanolic acid inC. amabile suggests its significant potential in the daily chemicalindustry. However, it is essential to prioritize an in-depth analysis ofthe chemical components.Author contributionsYF: Data curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation,Writing\u2013original draft.
