IntroductionNatural products have historically been an extremely productive source for new medicines inall cultures and continue to deliver a great variety of structural templates for drug discoveryand development. Although products derived from natural sources may not necessarilyrepresent active ingredients in their final form, the majority of all drugs in the market havetheir origin in nature [1, 2]. Therefore, the foremost emphasis in this chapter is given to aspectsconcerning the identification, properties, and development of potential drug candidates fromnatural products. It is the intention to give a high-level overview of the current status anddevelopments in the field. Many important aspects in the arena of natural therapeuticsincluding natural product sources, discovery, characterization, development and uses havebeen addressed and covered in depth in excellent recent reviews by extremely competentauthors referenced in this contribution.1.1. Definition of a natural productThe extent to which the term natural product has been characterized is both limited anddebatable. Therefore, a common definition that is accepted by all involved disciplines willremain a moving target, but likely will evolve as researchers unveil the vast amount ofcompounds projected to be discovered in this field [3]. In the simplest of terms, a naturalproduct is a small molecule that is produced by a biological source [3]. As a central theme ofexploration bordering chemistry and biology, natural products research focuses on thechemical properties, biosynthesis and biological functions of secondary metabolites [3]. In thiscontext, the task of defining \u201cnatural\u201d is more straight forward and encompasses isolation\u00a9 2013 Krause and Tobin; licensee InTech.

Thus, insummary, and for the purposes of this chapter, one can still agree with the refuted definitionthat a natural product is a pharmacologically or biologically active chemical compound orsubstance, which is found in nature and produced by a living organism and can even beconsidered as such if it can be prepared by a totally synthetic approach [4]. Albeit, we realizethis definition can be challenged as many biosynthetic enzymes are nonspecific and may resultin the production of multiple analogs combined with the fact that identifying the entirety ofnatural products is in the infant stage [5].Generally the term \u201cnatural product\u201d is regarded as being synonymous with \u201csecondarymetabolite\u201d [6]. Secondary metabolites are organic compounds in the correct chiral configu\u2010ration to exert biological activity, but have no \u201cprimary\u201d function directly involved in thenormal growth, development or reproduction of an organism [7]. Natural products are usuallyrelatively small molecules with a molecular weight below 3,000 Daltons and exhibit consid\u2010erable structural diversity [6]. The product categories in which natural compounds can befound as active ingredients include prescription and non-prescription drugs (pharmaceuti\u2010cals), cosmetic ingredients (cosmeceuticals) and dietary supplements and natural healthproduct ingredients (nutriceuticals) [8].The respective studies leading to the identification, isolation, and characterization of naturalproducts constitute an important part of the scientific field of pharmacognosy. The AmericanSociety of Pharmacognosy defines pharmacognosy as \u201cthe study of natural product molecules(typically secondary metabolites) that are useful for their medicinal, ecological, gustatory, or otherfunctional properties. The natural species that are the source of the compounds under study span allbiological kingdoms, most notably marine invertebrates, plants, fungi, and bacteria\u201d [9]. Amongst thevarious assortments and exciting capacities that are being explored within the arena ofpharmacognosy, this chapter will mostly address the study of health relevant medicinalproperties of natural compounds for drug discovery and development.1.2. HistoryNatural substances have evolved over a very long selection process to form optimal interac\u2010tions with biological macromolecules [10] which have activity on a biological system that isrelevant to the target disease. They have historically been the most productive source of activecompounds and chemical lead structures for the discovery and development of new medicines[11]. Since ancient times, civilizations used plants and plant extracts to ameliorate diseases andfoster healing. Early historic examples for medical treatments from natural sources include thediscovery of the beneficial effects of cardiotonic digitalis extracts from foxglove for treating somemanifestations of heart disease in the 18th century, the use of the bark of the willow andcinchona trees in treating fever and the effectiveness of poppy extracts in the treatment ofUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century4dysenteries [12]. Morphine, largely reproducing the analgesic and sedative effect of opium,was isolated from opium obtained from the seed pots of the poppy plant in 1804 [12]. Through\u2010out the century, purified bioactive natural products were extracted from the Peruvian barkcinchoa (quinine), from cocoa (cocaine), and from many other plants [12]. By 1829, scientistsdiscovered that the compound salicin, in willow trees, was responsible for pain relief and in1838 salicylic acid was isolated [13]. The problem was that salicylic acid was harsh on thestomach and in the second half of the 19th century acetylsalicylic acid was synthesized whichserved as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines [13]. Anumber of additional plants served as sources of natural product derived agents that are stillused in current routine medical practice [14].The discovery of valuable therapeutic agents from natural sources continued into the 20thcentury. Inspired by the discovery and benefits of penicillin, pharmaceutical research expand\u2010ed after the Second World War into intensive screening of microorganisms for new antibiotics[12]. The study of new bacterial and fungal strains resulted in the expansion of the antibacterialarsenal with additional agents such as cephalosporins, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides,rifamycins, chloramphenicol, and lipopeptides [15, 16]. In the 1950\u2019s, two nucleosides isolatedfrom Caribbean marine sponges paved the way for the synthesis of vidarabine, and the relatedcompound cytarabine, which eventually received approval as therapeutics for clinical use inviral diseases and cancer, respectively [17]. A more recent example is the cancer therapeuticpaclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae) derived from the Yew tree, which was discovered in the 1970s, but due todifficulties in obtaining commercial compound quantities only reached the market in late 1992[18-20]. Overall, only 244 prototypic chemical structures (over 80% came from animal, plant,microbial or mineral origin) have been used as templates to produce medicines up to 1995,and relatively few new scaffolds have appeared since [21,22]. About half of the marketedagents in today\u2019s arsenal of drugs are derived from biological sources with the large majoritybeing based on terrestrial natural product scaffolds [23]. Approximately 50% of the new drugsintroduced since 1994 were either natural products or derivatives thereof [21, 23, 24].2. Discovery and development2.1. DiscoveryDrug discovery involves the identification of new chemical entities (NCEs) of potentialtherapeutic value, which can be obtained through isolation from natural sources, throughchemical synthesis or a combination of both. The field of natural products drug discovery,despite the success stories of penicillin, paclitaxel, etc., also had aspects that made it lessattractive. In the traditional approach, drug targets were exposed to crude extracts, and in caseof evidence of pharmacological activity the extract was fractionated and the active compoundisolated and identified. This method was slow, labor intensive, inefficient, and provided noguarantee that a lead from the screening process would be chemically workable or evenpatentable [25, 26]. As natural products usually are molecules with more complex structures,Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/564245it was more difficult to extract, purify or synthesize sufficient quantities of a NCE of interestfor discovery and development activities [25]. Enriched or pure material is needed for the initialcharacterization of the chemical and biological properties as well as the elucidation of struc\u2010ture-activity relationships in drug discovery studies; furthermore, even larger quantities needto be supplied for potential later development activities and ultimately, the market [24, 27].The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s interest in natural products diminished with the advent of suchpromising new technologies like combinatorial chemistry (CC) and high throughput screening(HTS) [28]. The prospect of such disciplines, aimed at accelerating drug discovery efforts forNCEs, led some companies to dismiss their natural product programs [28]. Combinatorialchemistry employs parallel synthesis techniques allowing the creation of libraries containinghundreds of thousands of compounds, whereas HTS allows rapid testing of large numbers ofcompounds [28]. High-throughput screening grew out of automated clinical analyzer tech\u2010nologies and miniaturization in the late 1980\u2019s, as drug companies focused on methods aimingto increase the pace of testing and lower the cost per sample [12]. As a result, large libraries ofsynthetic molecules could be exploited very quickly. These new synthetic libraries were alsogiven preference because of the lack of compatibility of traditional natural product extractlibraries with HTS assays [28-30]. Compounds obtained from commercial libraries, in-housecollections of pharmaceutical companies containing hundreds of thousands of compounds andnew libraries generated through CC could be now screened rapidly [21]. Although the initialhopes for such advances were high, they were not fulfilled by either of the improved technol\u2010ogies. To be successful, HTS needed appropriate therapeutic targets matched to collections ofNCEs that are highly diverse in their structural and physicochemical properties. The approachto exclusively bank on synthetic compounds did not meet the initial expectations, as the newlycreated compound libraries had limited structural diversity and did not provide enoughquality hits to be of value. For CC, the most valuable role of parallel synthesis therefore appearsto be in expanding on an existing lead, rather than creating new screening libraries [12].Consequently, the interest in natural sources experienced some renaissance; however, even ifnatural product extracts were tested first, the pace of their isolation made it difficult to keepup with the demand for testing candidates in high-throughput models [25, 26, 29]. Therefore,natural products, and derivatives thereof, are still under-represented in the typical screeningdecks of the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry [31]. Specifically, it has beennoted that major pharmaceutical companies in the United States continue to favor approachesthat do not enable the integration of natural products of marine origin into their screeninglibraries [32]. More risk friendly institutions like academic laboratories, research institutes andsmall biotech companies venturing in the natural products arena have now a greater role indrug discovery and feed candidates into the development pipelines of big pharmaceuticalcompanies[32].Overall, there are limited systematic approaches to exploring traditionally used naturalproducts for compounds that could serve as drug leads. Additionally, the pharmaceuticalindustry has decreased their emphasis on natural product discovery from sources in variouscountries. Both of these facts may be based on possible uncertainties and concerns overexpectations about benefits sharing resulting from the United Nations Convention on Biolog\u2010Using Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century6ical Diversity (CBD) [21, 33, 34]. Countries are increasingly protective of their natural assets inflora and fauna and may not authorize the collection of sample species without prior approval[35]. In this context, potential handicaps may arise for companies as they develop and marketnew products from natural sources in the form of very difficult to negotiate agreements as wellas significant intellectual property and royalty issues [25, 26, 28, 35].Nonetheless, natural products continue to provide a valuable and rich pool for the discoveryof templates and drug candidates and are suitable for further optimization by synthetic meansbecause the chemical novelty associated with natural products is higher than that of structuresfrom any other source [10]. This fact is of particular importance when seeking out leadmolecules against newly discovered targets where no small molecule lead exists or in mech\u2010anistic and pathway studies when searching for chemical probes [24]. It is assumed that. inmany cases, structures devised by nature and evolution are far superior to even the bestsynthetic moieties in terms of diversity, specificity, binding efficiency, and propensity tointeract with biological targets [24]. In comparing a large number of natural products tocompounds from CC and synthetic drugs derived from natural substances, it has becomeevident that drugs and products obtained from natural sources exhibited more diverse andchemically complex structures [36]. In fact, only a moderate structural overlap was found whencomparing natural product scaffolds to drug collections with the natural product databasecontaining a significantly larger number of scaffolds and exhibiting higher structural novelty[37]. The structural diversity of these naturally sourced compounds supports the belief thatthe assortment of natural products represents a greater variety and better exemplifies the\u2018chemical space\u2019 of drug-like scaffolds than those of synthetic origin [30, 38, 39]. As Newmanand Cragg (2012) have stated, and demonstrated in their reviews for the 30-year period of 1981to 2010, natural products do play a dominant role in the discovery of lead structures for thedevelopment of drugs for the treatment of human diseases [1]. We agree with these authorsin their assumption that it is highly probable that in the near future totally synthetic variationsof even complex natural products will be part of the arsenal of physicians [1].In general, there is growing awareness of the limited structural diversity in existing compoundcollections. The historic focus of the pharmaceutical industry on a relatively small set of\u2018druggable\u2019 targets has resulted in the exploration of a very narrow chemical space appropriatefor these targets [40]. The 207 human targets described for small-molecule drugs correspondto only about 1% of the human genome and half of all drugs target only four protein classes[41]. So called \u2018undruggable\u2019 targets, such as protein-protein interactions and phosphatases,still await the identification of lead structures with the required qualities for lead or develop\u2010ment candidates [40]. Although the expectations in natural products for the future are stillhigh, an analysis of the distinct biological network between the targets of natural products anddisease genes revealed that natural products, as a group, may still not contain enoughversatility to yield suitable treatments for all heritable human diseases [42]. Nevertheless, theimportance of natural product related compound collections, as the most promising avenueto explore new bioactive chemical space for drug discovery, continues to be emphasized;consequently, efforts have been made over the last decade to generate CC libraries inspiredby natural product scaffolds [31, 43, 44]. Those scaffolds, which have presumably undergoneDiscovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/564247evolutionary selection over time, might possess favorable properties in terms of bioactivityand selectivity and therefore provide biologically validated valuable starting points for thedesign and generation of new combinatorial libraries [25, 26, 45, 46]. Thomas and Johannesstate that the production of relatively small natural product like libraries have revealedbiologically active compounds, while modification of natural products identified activity thatis entirely unrelated to the parent molecules [31].Libraries of small molecules of natural origin have already served as templates for the majorityof approved therapeutics including important compounds for the treatment of life-threateningconditions. Moreover, these small molecule libraries are constantly growing through productsextracted from various natural sources. Harvey et al. reviewed the current approaches forexpansion of natural product based compound libraries and CBD compliant collections existat the U.S. National Cancer Institute, academic institutions and commercial companies [11].However, large collections of pure natural products are rare and the quantities of individualcompounds that are isolated are typically small. A more recent strategy has been to use naturalproduct scaffolds as templates for creating libraries of semi-synthetic and synthetic analogues[21, 28, 47]. Rosen et al. identified several hundred unique natural products which could serveas starting points in the search for novel leads with particular properties [48]. Based on thecontinuous efforts of researchers in the field of marine drug discovery, more potent bioactivelead structures are expected with new or unknown mechanisms of action [23, 48]. The progressmade in the areas of cellular biology, genomics, and molecular mechanisms increased thenumber of druggable targets, allowing screening for candidates of natural compound librariesagainst an ever increasing number of potential molecular sites for therapeutic intervention.This increase in defined molecular targets combined with more automatization, more sensitivedetection instruments, and faster data processing allows for high throughput assays, whichcan rapidly screen large existing libraries of new and specific biological targets.In the last decade there has also been a major shift to technologically advanced and morecomplex screening assays conducted in cells, including those in which biological function isdirectly measured. These more complex approaches provide higher stringency which canmean lower hit rates. However, the specificity of such hits results in an increase in the qualityof leads with more desired biological properties [12]. In this context, bioassays based onzebrafish embryos are noteworthy, as they can be used in 96-well plates and allow for in vivobioactivity screening of crude extracts and natural substances at the microgram scale [49-52].A further improvement, potentially leading to new secondary metabolites of interest for drugdiscovery, is based on the development of refined analytical and spectroscopic methods. Thisinvolves rapid identification and structural elucidation (dereplication) of natural products incomplex mixtures (such as crude or pre-fractionated extracts) in parallel with profiling theirbioactivity in information-rich bioassays [53]. In addition, stress can be applied to stimulatethe number and levels of bioactive compounds in organisms. Wolfender and Queiroz pre\u2010sented examples of dynamic responses resulting from stress, which induced chemical defensesin elicitation experiments in both plants and microorganisms [30]. A significantly increasednumber of hits, including antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer agents were described forextracts from elicited plants [30]. New groups of microorganisms obtained through small scale,Using Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century8high-through-put cultivation methods and employing nutrient deficient media, specificnutrients and long cultivation times constitute another approach potentially leading to newsecondary metabolites of interest for drug discovery [54]. Genome mining, the analyses ofplant and microbial genome sequences for genes and gene clusters encoding proteins, is afurther recent approach which has allowed the discovery of numerous novel natural productsand also revealed gene clusters and novel pathways for the biosynthesis of several knownnatural compounds [55, 56].Although plants are still the major source for many natural products and remedies, microbesand marine organisms also constitute promising, abundant, and valuable sources for bioactivenatural compounds [57]. Like it is true for plants, also for these, only a very small fraction ofstructures of potential therapeutic relevance have been chemically analyzed or examined in abroad panel of screening models or bioassays. But even if discovered and identified, activesubstances from natural sources may not be readily available for further investigations,development or introduction to the market. A number of biologically relevant natural productscan only be isolated in small amounts, consequently adding to efforts, timelines and costs byforcing the development of an economically viable synthesis [31].2.2. DevelopmentThe time required to develop a pharmaceutical can range from only a few to as many as 20years. For natural products, an additional challenge can be the provision of sufficient quantitiesfrom natural sources for development and consequently commercial market supplies. Earlyin vitro tests may only require microgram to milligram amounts but the demand for compoundquantities will increase quickly when in vivo animal models, safety and toxicology studies,formulation development and ultimately clinical trials are initiated. As mentioned earlier, oneof the more recent respective examples is the cancer drug paclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae), which wasdiscovered in 1967 as the cytotoxic active ingredient in extracts of Taxus brevifolia but onlyapproved for the market in 1992 [20]. From 1967 to 1993, almost all paclitaxel produced wasderived from bark from the Pacific yew tree [18]. Harvesting of the bark kills the tree in theprocess, however, this production method was replaced by a more sustainable approach usinga precursor of Taxol\u00ae isolated from the leaves and needles of cultivated yew tree species [18,20].The compounds in development today target a variety of indications, mainly cancer andinfectious diseases (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic), but also address other therapeuticareas such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological illnesses and depression, metabolicdiseases (like diabetes and cholesterol management), and inflammatory diseases (like arthritis)[1, 15, 16, 25, 26]. The cytotoxic properties of many secondary metabolites from marineorganisms and bacteria are of particular interest for the development of new anticancertreatments [58]. For infectious diseases, natural products are effective because most of thesecompounds evolved from microbial warfare and show activity against other microorganismsat low concentrations [25, 26, 29]. The renewed interest in natural drugs is determined by theurgent need to find and develop effective means to fight infections caused by viruses, like HIV(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and so called \u201csuperbugs\u201d (bacteria with multiple resist\u2010Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/564249ance against antibiotics) currently in use [29]. Pathogens having only limited and ratherexpensive treatment options include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Clostridiumdifficile, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [29]. However, some new structures identified frommarine fungi exhibited activity against bacteria like MRSA [59].Before the advent of high throughput screening and the post-genomic era, more than 80% ofdrug substances or active ingredients were natural products, semisynthetic analogs thereof,or were obtained using structures of natural compounds as templates for synthetic modifica\u2010tion [60, 61]. Chin reported 23 drugs from natural sources being approved between 2000 and2005 [2]. Between 1998 and 2007 a total of 34 natural products and natural product-deriveddrugs were approved in different international markets [15, 62, 63].According to Brahmachari (2011), 38 natural product-derived drugs were approved in thedecade from 2000 to 2010 for various indications including 15 for infectious diseases, 7 eachfor oncology, neurological diseases and cardiovascular disorders, 4 for metabolic disordersand 1 for diabetes [22]. It is therefore not surprising that by 2008 more than a hundred newdrug candidates from natural sources like plants, bacteria, fungi and animals or those ob\u2010tained semi-synthetically were reported to be in clinical development with a similar numberin preclinical development [60]. Of those in clinical development, 91 were described to beplant-derived [63]. Although this was a lower number than in the years before, the interestin natural sources to obtain pharmacologically active compounds has recently been rekin\u2010dled with improved access to a broader base of sources including those from new microbialand marine origins [23, 64]. Brahmachari (2011) reported 49 plant-derived, 54 microorgan\u2010ism-derived, 14 marine organism derived (including 2 from fish and 1 from a cone snail),and 1 terrestrial animal-derived (bovine neutrophils) drug candidate(s) in various phases ofclinical evaluation [22].Natural products have been the biggest single source of anti-cancer drugs as evidenced by thehistorical data reviewed by Newman and Cragg [1]. Of the 175 anti-cancer agents developedand approved over the seven decades from 1940 until 2010 in Western countries and Japan, 85compounds representing 48.6%, were natural products or directly derived from naturalproducts [1]. The four major structural classes of plant derived cancer treatments include Vincaalkaloids, Epipodophyllotoxin lignans, Taxane diterpenoids and Camptotectin quinolonealkaloid derivatives. Approximately 30 plant derived anti-cancer compounds have beenreported to be clinically active against various types of tumors and are currently used in clinicaltrials [65].A potential development candidate is typically isolated from its natural source only inmilligram quantities [6]. Testing in vitro occurs in assays such as the U.S National CancerInstitute 60-cell-line panel, followed by human tumor-derived cell lines in primary culture andin vivo animal models such as the above mentioned zebrafish embryos, the hollow-fiber humantumor cell assay or human tumor xenografts in rodents [6, 50, 52, 66]. Harvey and Cree haverecently reviewed current screening systems for anti-cancer activity suitable for use withcollections of natural products. These include quantification of cell growth or cell death instandard cancer cell, three-dimensional and primary cell culture, as well as cell-based reporterUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century10and molecular assays [50]. The quantification of cell growth or cell death in culture usingsignals like caspase-3 as a marker for apoptosis come with the handicap that the artificialculture environment may not be suitable to predict activity in in vivo animal models or cancerpatients [50]. Another concern raised is the fact that compounds which kill readily proliferatingcancer cells in culture may not eliminate the tumor because of the persistence of cancer stemcells for which suitable screening assays with significant throughput are still lacking [50].Cancer stem cells are only present in low abundance and remain in a quiescent state untilreceiving environmental cues such as overexpression of growth factors, cytokines, or chemo\u2010kines resulting in recurrence of cancer after initially successful treatment and loss of efficacyof the initial treatment agent in the relapsed disease [67].Dietary sources of compounds assumed to have anti-cancer benefits include fruits, vegetablesand spices yielding biologically active components such as curcumin, resveratrol, cucurbita\u2010cins, isoflavones, saponins, phytosterols, lycopene, and many others [68]. A number of theseare gaining importance as adjuvant anti-cancer agents with curcumin, resveratrol andcucurbitacins having activity reported against cancer stem cells [67]. Bhanot et al list 39 naturalcompounds from marine species, mostly invertebrates, and 10 from microorganisms, mostlyfrom bacteria of the Streptomyces genus, as potential new anti-cancer agents [68]. It is assumedthat many prokaryotic and eukaryotic natural product sources may still reveal a number ofvaluable anti-cancer compounds in the future and even ancient animal species have beensuggested as a particularly valuable source [69].Anti-virals constitute another important class of needed therapeutics. The HIV type-1 (HIV-1)is the cause of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a major human viral diseasewith over 34 million people infected worldwide in 2012 and approximately 1.7 million dyingper year [70]. Failure of anti-HIV therapy is observed due to the emergence of drug resistanceand the significant side effect profile of existing therapies [71]. Hence, the quest for novelprospective drug candidates with fewer side effects and increased efficacy against various HIVstrains also relies on natural products. Naturally derived anti-HIV compounds found to bemost promising for the treatment HIV infections, with the potential to overcome drug-resistance of mutated HIV strains, were described to be flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids,tannins, alkaloids, polyphenols, polysaccharides or proteins [72, 73]. Despite the need foraffordable, effective, and better tolerated treatments, the vast majority of the potential naturalanti-HIV compounds described have so far only been tested as in vitro, ex vivo or in silicoapproaches to identify activity; the findings have not yet been confirmed in relevant in vivosystems. Only a few of the many natural products that have been reported to exhibit anti-HIVactivities have reached clinical trials and none of them made it on the list of conventionalantiretroviral drugs [71, 72].Antiviral agents from marine sources which demonstrated activity against HIV were recentlyreviewed by Vo and Kim (2010). These include phlorotannins from brown algae, sulfatedderivatives of chitin from the shells of crabs and shrimps including chitosan (producedcommercially by deacetylation of chitin), sulfated polysaccharides from marine algae, lectinsor carbohydrate-binding proteins from a variety of different species (ranging from prokaryotesto corals, algae, fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) as well as bioactive peptidesDiscovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/5642411isolated by enzymatic hydrolysis of marine organisms [73]. Until now, most of the anti-HIVactivities of these marine-derived inhibitors were also only observed in in vitro assays or inmouse model systems and still await confirmation of their value in clinical trials [73].3. Natural product sourcesHistorically, the most important sources for biologically active natural products have beenterrestrial plants and microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. Terrestrial and aquaticspecies of plants and microorganisms, especially those of marine origin, produce uniquebioactive substances yielding a large variety of valuable therapeutics and lead structures forpotential new drugs. Even though natural products may not have coevolved with humanproteins, they have emerged in nature to interact with biomolecules [74]. Natural productsinteract with a wide variety of proteins and other biological targets, acting also as modulatorsof cellular processes when they inhibit the difficult to target protein-protein interactions [27,40].Since the middle of the last century, marine species and microorganisms have consistently andincreasingly raised interest as sources for new agents and scaffolds [75]. In recent years, otherless conventional sources like alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, spices, animal andhuman excreta, and many more have generated interest for natural product researchers [75].The more conventional sources for secondary metabolites like plants, marine organisms andmicroorganisms will be described in more detail in the following sections.3.1. PlantsA significant number of drugs have been derived from plants that were traditionally employedin ethnomedicine or ethnobotany (the use of plants by humans as medicine as in Ayurvedicor Traditional Chinese Medicine), while others were discovered initially (through randomscreening of plant extracts in animals) or later, by determining their in vitro activity againstHIV or cancer cell lines [6, 50, 71-73]. An avenue that may have influenced ethnopharmacologysuggests that some traditionally used remedies may have arisen from observations of self-medication by animals [76]. Studies have shown that wild animals often consumed plants andother material for medical rather than nutritional reasons, treating parasitic infections andpossible viral and bacterial diseases [11, 60, 76, 77]. For drug discovery, the chemical andpharmacologic investigation of ethnobotanical information offers a viable alternative to high-throughput screening and the body of existing ethnomedical knowledge has led to greatdevelopments in health care. It would appear that selection of plants, based on long-termhuman use in conjunction with appropriate biologic assays that correlate with the ethnobo\u2010tanical uses, should be most successful [78]. Nevertheless, therapeutic approaches based onactive principles from single plant and polyherbal formulations from traditional medicines,like the ones mentioned in Ayurvedic texts, still require scientific validation and sufficientpharmacoepidemiological evidence supporting their safety and efficacy [79]. This is evidencedby the example of aristolochic acid, a constituent of Aristolochia vines, which are used inUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century12complementary and alternative therapies. Aristolochic acid is a powerful nephrotoxin and ahuman carcinogen associated with chronic kidney disease and upper urinary tract urothelialcarcinomas (UUC) [80]. These dual toxicities and the target tissues were revealed when a groupof otherwise healthy Belgian women developed renal failure and UUC after ingestingAristolochia herbs in conjunction with a weight-loss regime; subsequently, more cases werereported in Taiwan and countries throughout the world [80]. Importantly, the traditionalpractice of Chinese herbal medicine in Taiwan mirrors that in China and other Asian countriesmaking it likely that these toxicities are also prevalent in these and in other countries whereAristolochia herbs have long been used for treatment and prevention of disease, therebycreating an international public health problem of considerable magnitude [80, 81].In the early 1900\u2019s, 80% of all medicines were obtained from roots, barks and leaves and it isestimated is that approximately 25% of all drugs prescribed today still originate from plants[14, 19, 78]. The plant kingdom, with 300,000 to 400,000 higher species (estimated levels reachfrom 215,000 up to 500,000 [78], was always a key source of new chemical entities (NCEs) foractive pharmaceutical ingredients and lead compounds [12]. It is estimated that only 5% to15% of these terrestrial plants have been chemically and pharmacologically investigated in asystemic fashion [19]. Approximately 10,000 to 15,000 of the world\u2019s plants have documentedmedicinal uses and roughly 150-200 have been incorporated in western medicine [19, 82].Marine plants like microalgae, macroalgae (seaweeds) and flowering plants (such as man\u2010groves) have been studied to a much lesser extent and are mostly reported in connection withnutritional, supplemental or ethnopharmacological uses [83]. For over 20 years the U.S.National Cancer Institute has collected higher plants for screening, with the current collectioncomposed of ~ 30,000 species [84]. Only a small percentage of these have reportedly beenscreened for biological or phytochemical activity until a decade ago and large numbers areconstantly being tested for their possible pharmacological value today [35, 78]. Based on theirresearch, the authors justify their assumption that the plant kingdom still holds many speciescontaining substances of medicinal value and for potential pharmaceutical applications, whichhave yet to be discovered. However, such assumptions may be diminished as the loss ofvaluable natural sources increases due to factors such as deforestation, environmentalpollution, and global warming [85].Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. provided evidence through phylogenetic cross-cultural comparisonsthat related plants from different geographic regions are used to treat medical conditions inthe same therapeutic areas [86]. Accordingly, there has been a recent surge in interest in thecomponents of traditional Chinese medicines and Ayurvedic remedies [11]. Limitations of thisapproach include the fact that both of these ancient traditions use polyherbal preparations(botanicals) for the majority of prescriptions and that plants as biological systems have aninherent potential variability in their chemistry and resulting biological activity [12, 35].Fabricant and Farnsworth reported that 25% of all plants showing biological activity in theirassay system failed to reproduce the activity on sub-sequent recollections [35]. This may becaused by factors coming into play after the collection of a specimen, however, for plants it iscommon to dry the collected plant parts thoroughly in the field before extraction to assure thatthe material does not compose before reaching the laboratory [12].Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/5642413Rout et al. describe the approaches for using individual plants as therapeutic agents as follows:(i) to isolate bioactive compounds for direct use as drugs, (ii) to produce bioactive derivativesof known compounds as new structures, (iii) to use substances as pharmacologic agents ortools, and (iv) to use a whole or partial plant as herbal remedy and provide examples for eachcategory [78]. Mixtures of plant-derived products are known as botanicals, and the term isdefined by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to describe finished,labeled products that contain vegetable matter as ingredients which can include plantmaterials, algae, macroscopic fungi, and combinations thereof [87]. They can fall under theclassification of a food (including a dietary supplement), a drug (including a biological drug),a medical device, or a cosmetic [87]. The vast majority of plant-derived treatments are basedon synthetic, semisynthetic, or otherwise highly purified or chemically modified drugs [87,88]. According to the most recent report by BCC Research, the global plant-derived drugmarket was valued at US$ 22.1 billion in 2012 and sales are projected to grow to US$ 26.6 billionby 2017 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8% [89]. The botanicals subgroupcurrently has only one approved drug, Veregen, with an expected revenue increase from US$ 2.8 million in 2010 to 599 million in 2017 [89].3.2. Marine lifeGiven the fact that oceans cover nearly 70% of the earth\u2019s surface and that life originated inthe oceans with the first marine organisms evolving more than 3.5 billion years ago, theenormous diversity of organisms in the marine environment is not surprising and largelyunexplored [90]. On some coral reefs, their density can reach up to 1,000 species per squaremeter, which is believed to be a higher biodiversity than observed in tropical rainforests andinspired researchers for decades to search for novel compounds from marine sources [57, 91].As the greatest biodiversity is found in the oceans, it is estimated that between 250,000 andone million marine species could provide an immense resource to discover NCEs serving asunprecedented novel bioactive structures and scaffolds that have the potential to serve asmedical treatments or templates for new therapeutics [23, 92].The interest in novel chemical structures from marine organisms started in the 1950s as marineanimal taxonomy advanced significantly, but progressed at a slow pace for the first twodecades before it started to burgeon in the 1970s [91-94]. Since then, approximately 30,000structurally diverse natural products with a vast array of bioactivities have been discoveredfrom marine organisms including microbes, algae and invertebrates [92, 95]. Invertebratesalone comprise approximately 60% of all marine animals and were described as the source ofalmost 10,000 new natural products since 1990 with a pronounced increase to about 1,000compounds per year in more recent years [23, 32, 93].By the turn of the 21st century larger percentages of bioactive NCEs were reported for marineorganisms in comparison to terrestrial organisms, but nevertheless, marine chemical ecologyis still several decades behind its terrestrial counterpart with respect to the total number ofcharacterized and documented natural products [93, 96]. Kong et al. specifically comparednatural products from terrestrial and marine sources. They found that compounds frommarine organisms exhibited a higher chemical novelty and that over 2/3 of those scaffolds wereUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century14exclusively used by marine species, but alerted readers to concerns of the suitability of the newscaffolds as drug templates because of their unsuitably high hydrophobicity [96]. As is the casefor plant derived natural compounds, the U.S. National Cancer Institute also plays an impor\u2010tant role for establishing marine organism collections since the 1980s and has a vast Nationalrepository of invertebrate derived compounds and extracts from specimens rigorouslyidentified by taxonomic experts [92].Many marine natural products appear to arise from multi-functional enzymes that are alsopresent in terrestrial systems, exhibiting a cross phylum activity with terrestrial biota [94, 95].However, a large number of marine derived compounds also possess a substantial amount offunctional groups, which were not previously described from terrestrial metabolites [91, 94,95]. They range from derivatives of amino acids and nucleosides to macrolides, porphyrins,terpenoids, aliphatic cyclic peroxides, and sterols [91]. These secondary metabolites resultedfrom evolutionary pressure threatening many marine organisms, especially those which aresoft bodied and have a sedentary life style, forcing them to develop the ability to synthetizetoxic compounds which serve to deter predators, manage competitors or immobilize prey [57,91, 93, 94]. The search for new drug candidates from marine species has expanded intocircumpolar regions for cold-adapted species as well as harsh environments like deep-seahydrothermal vents; these approaches have been particularly successful with filter-feederssuch as sponges, tunicates and bryozoans [23, 97].The fact that marine invertebrates contain astounding levels of microbial diversity and formhighly complex microbial communities led to the assumption, followed by confirmation inrecent examples, that microbial symbionts like bacteria are important producers of naturalproducts derived from marine species [58]. In particular, these include polyketides and non-ribosomally synthesized peptides as well as unique biosynthetic enzymes which emerged aspotent biocatalysts in medicinal chemistry [58, 97].By 2010, four drugs of marine origin had obtained approval for the treatment of humandisorders [98]. Cytarabine (Cytosar-U\u00ae; Upjohn/Pfizer) for the treatment of white blood cellcancers, vidarabine (Vira-A\u00ae; discontinued by distributor Monarch Pharmaceuticals) anophtalmic antiviral, and ziconotide (Prialt\u00ae; Elan) for pain management were FDA approvedand trabectedin (Yondelis\u00ae; Pharmamar), an anticancer compound against soft tissue andovarian cancer was approved in Europe [98]. Vidarabine and cytarabine originate from marinesponges, ziconotide is the synthetic equivalent of a conopeptide originating from a marinecone snail, and trabectedin, now produced synthetically, originates from a bacterial symbiontof a tunicate or sea squirt [32, 99]. At the same time, 13 marine organism-derived drugcandidates were listed to be in clinical development (3 in Phase III, 7 in Phase II, and 3 in PhaseI) and hundreds are in pre-clinical testing as ion channel blockers, enzyme inhibitors, DNA-interactive and microtubule-interfering agents, with the majority of the latter compoundsbeing tested for anti-tumor and cytotoxic properties [91, 94, 98]. Natural products of marineorigin with biological activity of interest include, but are not limited to, curacin A, eleutherobin,discodermolide, bryostatins, dolostatins, cephalostatins [16].Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/56424153.3. MicroorganismsMicroorganisms were identified early on as sources of valuable natural products as evidencedby the discovery of penicillin by from the fungus Penicillium rubens by Alexander Fleming in1928 [100]. Historically, microorganisms (amongst them mostly bacteria and fungi) haveplayed an important role in providing new structures, like antibiotics for drug discovery anddevelopment. The terrestrial microbial populations are immensely diverse which is alsoreflected in the number of compounds and metabolites isolated from these microorganisms.As mentioned above, the similarity of many compounds from marine invertebrates likesponges, ascidians, soft corals and bryozoans to those isolated from terrestrial microbes led tothe hypothesis that associated microorganisms might be responsible for their production. Overtime it became more and more evident, that a significant number of marine natural productsare actually not produced by the originally assumed invertebrate but rather by microbes livingin symbioses with their invertebrate host [92, 101]. In some instances it could indeed bedemonstrated early on that the isolated marine microbes are the original source of the newcompounds or secondary metabolites discovered and in recent years marine bacteria haveemerged more and more as a source of NCEs [58, 91, 94, 95]. Besides bacteria, marine fungiand deep-sea hydrothermal vent microorganisms are reported to produce bioactive com\u2010pounds and metabolites [91, 94]. Deep-sea vent sites offer harsh conditions in depth below 200meters with complete absence of light, pressures in excess of 20 atmospheres, temperatures ofup to 400\u00b0Celius, pH extremes and high sulfide concentrations and are populated by highlydense and unique, biologically diverse communities [91, 94, 102].Unique microorganisms are abundant on land, in freshwater and all areas of the ocean.However, the enormous biological diversity of free-living and symbiotic marine microbes hasso far only been explored to a very limited extent. The estimates extrapolate the number ofmarine species to at least a million, but for marine microbial species, including fungi andbacteria, the estimated numbers reach as high as tens or even hundreds of millions [23]. Over74,000 known species of fungi are reported including around 3,000 aquatic species of whichonly about 465 are described as marine species, but a vast geographical area has not yet beensampled and estimates for the potential total number of species reach from 0.5 to 9.9 millionwith about 1.5 million considered as most realistic [103, 104]. The overlap is assumed to berelatively high between species in terrestrial and freshwater habitats, but not between thesetwo and the marine habitat [104]. Nevertheless, a large percentage of the over 270 secondarymetabolites isolated from marine fungi resembles analogues of compounds previouslydiscovered from terrestrial fungi but some of the new substances identified exhibited potentactivities against tumor cells, microbes or bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA) or even antifouling properties [59, 105]. In comparison to bacteria, fungi appearto be rare in marine environments and few marine fungi isolates exist in culture [106]. Marinebacteria are assumed to constitute approximately 10% of the living biomass carbon and inhabitmainly sediments but can also be found in open oceans and in association with marineorganisms [90, 91, 94]. Many marine invertebrates are associated with large amounts ofepibiotic and endobiotic microorganisms and for many sponges bacteria can make up to 40%of the animal biomass and even resemble new species [97]. In fact it is assumed that almost allUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century16marine organisms host bacteria on their surface and that the vast majority bare epibiotic filmsof variable density and composition, which can affect the basibiont\u2019s physiology and interac\u2010tions with its environment in beneficial, detrimental, or ambiguous manners [107]. Thisconstitutes a vast pool for the discovery of new structures and scaffolds if the source can beunanimously established.To identify the source of a compound, the determination of its mere presence in a certainorganism is not sufficient, as this could be the result of active or passive accumulation and doesnot necessarily reflect the true site of its biosynthetic production. As Gulder and Moore furtherexplain: \u201cAn unambiguous assignment of the biosynthetic origin of a natural product derived from acomplex assemblage of marine organisms thus has to originate at the genomic level. This is particularlytrue for bacterial symbionts, which have to date eluded cultivation\u201d [58]. These microbes generallyorganize their biosynthetic genes for each secondary metabolite in compact clusters, which will,following identification and sequencing of the cluster responsible for the respective path\u2010ways, allow the transfer of the respective bacterial genes into effective heterologous produc\u2010ers, like Escherichia coli (E. coli) [55, 58, 97]. In terms of microbial sources, culturing of therespective microorganism may generally be a viable approach to increase quantities. A majordifference between microorganisms from terrestrial and marine sources is the fact that marinepelagic bacteria are much more difficult to grow in culture than the soil borne actinomycetes;therefore determining the conditions for replication, growth of sufficient quantities andinduction of metabolite production can be a tedious challenge [12, 17]. This again may necessi\u2010tate the production in a heterologous system like that observed for E. coli.4. ChallengesNatural products, although a valuable and precious resource, also come with their fair shareof challenges in a variety of aspects. As mentioned before, one of the major issues concerningthe use of natural products are the difficulties associated with obtaining sufficient amounts ofmaterial pure enough for discovery and development activities. If a compound is derived froma plant growing only in small quantities or remote locations or a marine organism residing ingreat depth or difficult to access regions, re-supply becomes a problem.The threat of losing potentially valuable natural sources of pharmacologically active ingredi\u2010ents is constantly increasing due to the threat of extinction by deforestation of large landmass\u2010es and environmental pollution in remote areas as well as global warming [85]. It is estimatedthat about 70% of the supply of herbal raw material for Ayurveda and other homeopathicmedicines in India comes from the wild [82, 85]. To meet the increasing demand for raw material,to conserve wild resources, and to reduce the potential variability in the active ingredient contentin medicinal plants from different collection areas, it is important to implement more control\u2010led cultivation programs to ensure quality and to protect resources [82, 85].Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/5642417Tissues of marine invertebrates present unique problems for extraction, because of their highwater and salt content, and the promising compounds may be present only in low amountsand/or can be very difficult to isolate. Sponges and their microbial fauna are mostly not suitablefor culture, and the compounds of interest need to be extracted and purified from specimenscollected in the wild [17, 93]. Marine organisms and microbes constitute a valuable potentialsource of NCEs and structural templates for drug discovery in the future, but may necessitatetons of raw material to isolate milligram to gram amounts of the compound of interest [97].This difficulty combined with the challenges for synthetic approaches to obtain significantquantities of potential new drug candidates, based on their often highly complex structures,are obstacles that can hamper their use in discovery and development [58, 97]. In some cases,supply issues could be resolved by semi-synthesis or total synthesis of the compound, thedevelopment of synthetic analogs with more manageable properties, or by design of apharmacophore of reduced complexity, which can then be synthesized [17, 92, 97]. Fragmentsor synthetic analogs with simplified structures may retain bioactivity or even show improvedactivity towards the target [12].Furthermore, environmental aspects can constitute significant hurdles for supplying materialfor discovery and development as the product may stem from an endangered species or thewild collection of the producing species may be detrimental to its originating terrestrial ormarine ecosystem. Additionally, as mentioned above, because of their low abundance manycompounds of interest from natural sources need to be extracted and purified from largequantities of specimen collected in the wild, which in turn carries the risks of over-exploitationand habitat destruction [17, 93]. Radjasa et al. provide a positive outlook for marine ecosystemsand state \u201cThere is optimism for the future because the international marine bioorganic communityclearly recognizes that invertebrates must be harvested and studied in an environmentally sustainablemanner\u201d [92]. Although aquaculture of marine species or culture of bacteria seem like logicalalternative sources to obtain product, they are not viable avenues in most cases because itproves difficult to impossible to culture the source organisms (especially invertebrates and/ortheir microbial symbionts like bacteria etc.) or they may not produce the compound of interestunder the given culture conditions [12, 17, 95, 97]. Findings indicate, that the bacterialcomposition on invertebrates is largely independent from sponge taxonomy or locality ofcollection and the bacteria most likely are contaminants from the ocean water rather thanspecific symbionts, which further exacerbates the cultivation problem [97, 108].Another challenge can result from redundant activity determination in assay systems and themixed composition of natural product extracts. With over 150,000 known small moleculescharacterized from natural sources, previously known natural products are often re-isolatedin the course of bioassay-guided fractionation [84]. While this may be acceptable if thebiological activity is new, it is frustrating to waste resources on the de novo structure elucidationof known compounds. Furthermore, not all compounds contained in natural product extractsare drug leads and it is extremely desirable to remove \u201cnuisance compounds\u201d like tannins,phorbol esters, saponins, and anionic polysaccharides; the latter, for instance, being highlyactive in cellular HIV bioassays [35].Using Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century18Last, but not least, intellectual property rights can pose a significant hurdle that is difficult tomanage. In general, patent protection can be obtained if the active principles derived fromnatural sources have novel structures and relevant biological activity. However, as mentionedbefore, additional handicaps may arise in the context of developing and marketing productsfrom natural sources in the form of potentially significant intellectual property issues as wellas, possibly, very difficult and costly negotiations to obtain agreements to collect and developnatural products from species collected in foreign countries [25, 26, 35].5. Regulatory requirements and risksThe regulatory requirements for different product categories containing natural substanceslike pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmeceuticals vary from rather stringent to gener\u2010ous to non-existent at an International level. To exemplify regulatory approaches for the threeaforementioned categories, an overview of the current situation in North America (U.S. andCanada) and the European Union is summarized. In many areas we have presented exactwording from the respective governing websites, as the phrasing of such represents the officialcontext and any deviation thereof could be misleading.5.1. Natural product-derived pharmaceuticalsNatural products constitute a key source of pharmacologically active ingredients in a varietyof novel agents with therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases. Pharmaceuticalscontaining natural products or compounds derived from natural product scaffolds or tem\u2010plates have to undergo the same stringent approval process as drugs obtained from purelysynthetic origin.5.1.1. North America5.1.1.1. United States of America (U.S.)The U.S. Government Office for the Control of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) overseesthe regulatory control of pharmaceuticals including new treatments based on natural products[109]. The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) role is to evaluate andapprove new drugs before they can be sold ensuring that drugs are safe and effective forintended use and that their health benefits outweigh their known risks [109].5.1.1.2. CanadaIn Canada, Health Canada fulfills the same role as the US FDA according to the mandate underthe authority of the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations [110].Discovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/56424195.1.2. European UnionThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) with headquarters in London/England regulatesdrugs and medicinal products in the European Union (EU) [111]. On April 30th, 2011 the EUentered into force the directive on herbal medicine products called Traditional HerbalMedicinal Products Directive 2004/24/EC, THMPD [111]. The regulation came as a sub-directive for the act on Human Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC claiming a unique setof information on a herbal substance or herbal preparation for all EU Member States. Suchcould be used when evaluating marketing applications for herbal medicinal products fromcompanies and covers medicinal products containing herbal substances/preparations [111].To reach the market, these must fall within one of the following three categories, as outlinedon the EMA website [111]:1. a product can be classified under traditional medicinal use provisions (\u2018traditional use\u2019)accepted on the basis of sufficient safety data and plausible efficacy: the product is granteda traditional use registration (simplified registration procedure) by a Member State,2. a product can be classified under well-established medicinal use provisions (\u2018well-established use\u2019). This is demonstrated with the provision of scientific literature estab\u2010lishing that the active substances of the medicinal products have been in well-establishedmedicinal use within the Union for at least ten years, with recognized efficacy and anacceptable level of safety. As a result the product is granted a marketing authorizationusually by a Member State or by the European Medicines Agency. While both classifica\u2010tions have specific requirements, both regulatory paths involve the assessment of mostlybibliographic safety and efficacy data.3. a product can be authorized after evaluation of a marketing authorization applicationconsisting of only safety and efficacy data from the company\u2019s own development (\u2018standalone\u2019) or a combination of own studies and bibliographic data (\u2018mixed application\u2019). Asa result the product is granted a marketing authorization by a Member State or by theAgency via the centralized procedure if all requirements are met.In summary, while safety needs to be shown for products, proof of efficacy is not always arequirement and only the traditional indications in specified conditions must be plausible.Nonetheless, and irrespective of the regulatory pathway to access the market, the quality ofthe herbal medicinal product must always be demonstrated [111].The Directive provides definitions for herbal medicinal products, herbal preparations andherbal substances, as follows [111]:\u2022 Herbal medicinal product: Any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredientsone or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more suchherbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations.\u2022 Herbal substances: All mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichenin an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have notbeen subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. HerbalUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century20substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name accordingto the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author).\u2022 Herbal preparations: Preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatmentssuch as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration orfermentation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures,extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudatesAdditionally, it has been noted that from a herbal substance (e.g. valerian root) different herbalpreparations (e.g. a valerian root extract using 70% ethanol) can be made; in such cases, bothcan represent the active ingredient in an individual herbal medicinal product [111].5.2. Nutraceuticals \u2014 Dietary supplements (U.S.)/Natural health products (Canada)Even if natural health products (NHPs) or dietary supplements are considered as or expectedto be safe, they may still carry potential risks in themselves or through interactions withprescription or Over The Counter (OTC) drugs. This is illustrated by the previously describedexample of aristolochic acid, a powerful nephrotoxin and a human carcinogen associated withchronic kidney disease and upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas after ingesting Aristolo\u2010chia herbs in conjunction with a weight-loss regime [80, 81]. Furthermore, interactions betweenNHPs and prescription medicines are of increasing concern and need to be considered byphysicians and patients alike [112]. Mills et al, in their evaluation of 47 trials which examineddrug interactions with 19 different herbal preparations, observed potentially clinicallysignificant drug interactions with St. Johns Wort, garlic, and American ginseng [113].5.2.1. North America5.2.1.1. United States of AmericaIn the U.S., biologically active food and dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA and areclassified as food and nutrition, not drugs [88]. The FDA website provides a detailed overviewof their regulatory approach concerning nutraceuticals. The following paragraphs reflect somecore points as outlined on the FDA\u2019s respective website [88].\u2022 The FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredientsunder a different set of regulations than those covering \"conventional\" foods and drugproducts (prescription and OTC). Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act(DSHEA) of 1994, the dietary supplement or dietary ingredient manufacturer is responsiblefor ensuring that a dietary supplement or ingredient is safe before it is marketed. The FDAis responsible for taking action against any unsafe dietary supplement product after itreaches the market. Generally, manufacturers do not need to register their products withthe FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling dietary supplements.\u2022 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that manufacturers and distributorswho wish to market dietary supplements that contain \"new dietary ingredients\" notify theFood and Drug Administration about these ingredients, which must include informationDiscovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/5642421that is the basis on which manufacturers/distributors have concluded that a dietarysupplement containing a new dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safeunder the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling [87].\u2022 The U.S. Congress defined the term \"dietary supplement\" and both of the terms \"dietaryingredient\" and \"new dietary ingredient\" as components of dietary supplements in theDSHEA. A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a \"dietaryingredient\" intended to supplement the diet.\u2022 In order to be a \"dietary ingredient,\" it must be one or any combination of the followingsubstances:\u2022 A \"new dietary ingredient\" is one that meets the above definition for a \"dietary ingredient\"and was not sold in the U.S. in a dietary supplement before October 15, 1994.\u2022 Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many formssuch as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders [88]. They can also be in otherforms, such as a bar, but if they are, information on their label must not represent the productas a conventional food or a sole item of a meal or diet [88]. Whatever their form may be, theDSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of\"foods,\" not drugs, and requires that every supplement be labeled a dietary supplement.5.2.1.2. CanadaIn Canada, the use and sale of natural health products (NHPs) is on the rise [8]. A 2010 Ipsos-Reid survey showed that 73% of Canadians regularly take natural health products (NHPs) likevitamins and minerals, herbal products, and homeopathic medicines [114]. Health Canadadefines natural health products under the Natural Health Products Regulations as:\u2022 Vitamins and minerals\u2022 Herbal remedies\u2022 Homeopathic medicines\u2022 Traditional medicines such as traditional Chinese medicines\u2022 Probiotics\u2022 Other products like amino acids and essential fatty acids [115].Natural Health Products must be safe to use as OTC products and not need a prescription tobe sold [115]. Natural products, compounds and active ingredients derived from naturalsources or totally synthesized and needing a prescription are regulated as drugs under theFood and Drug Regulations [115].5.2.2. European UnionHerbal supplements and nutritional supplements are not regulated on a harmonized EU widebasis and remain under the control of the relevant medical institutions of the individual EUmember states.Using Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century225.3. CosmeceuticalsAlthough the term is not recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or bythe European Medicines Agency (EMA), it has been widely adopted by the cosmetics industry,which is rapidly expanding in spite of global economic woes in recent years [116]. The globalcosmeceuticals market references the seven most developed markets including the U.S. andthe top five European countries, namely the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain; as well asJapan [116]. In 2011, the global cosmeceuticals market was estimated to be worth $30.9 billion(with the aforementioned European countries accounting for approximately 65% of overallrevenues) and is expected to reach $42.4 billion by 2018 [116]. Three major categories have beennoted in the cosmeceutical industry including skin care, hair care, and others, with the skincare segment accounting for the largest share of the market at 43% [117]. Dominated by anti-aging products, the skin-care market is expected to contribute significantly to future growthbased on the aging populations in the top seven aforementioned markets [116].Cosmeceuticals are topically applied and represent a hybrid of cosmetics and pharmaceuticalsusually containing vitamins, herbs, various oils, and botanical extracts or a mixture thereofincluding antioxidants, growth factors, peptides, anti-inflammatories/botanicals, polysacchar\u2010ides, and pigment-lightening agents [117, 118]. The combination of cosmetics and foodsresulted in products termed nutricosmetics. Nutricosmetics are foods and supplementsclaiming cosmetic effects with major ingredients like soy isoflavone proteins, lutein, lycopene,vitamins (A, B6, E), omega-3 fatty acids, beta-carotene probiotics, sterol esters, chondrotin andcoenzyme Q10 [119, 120]. These compounds act as antioxidants and the respective nutricos\u2010metics containing them are being promoted for their skin care properties as for instance in anti-aging by fighting free radicals generated as a by-product of biochemical reactions through skinexposure to the sun [119].5.3.1. North America5.3.1.1. United States of AmericaIn the US, products that can be put in both the cosmetics and drugs category, such as cosmeticproducts with active ingredients which claim therapeutic use, require New Drug Application(NDA) approval or must comply with the appropriate monograph for an (OTC) drug.Moreover, the FDA also has specific guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) forcosmetics [116].While the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) does not recognize the term\"cosmeceutical\", the cosmetic industry uses this word to refer to cosmetic products that havemedicinal or drug-like benefits [118]. The FD&C Act defines drugs as those products that cure,treat, mitigate or prevent disease or that affect the structure or function of the human body[121]. Under the FD&C Act, cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of coloradditives, do not require FDA approval before they go on the market [121]. Therefore, whiledrugs are subject to a review and approval process by the FDA, cosmetics are not approvedby the FDA prior to sale. However, when a product makes a therapeutic claim (e.g. to preventor treat disease), it is classified as a drug and therefore requires evaluation by the FDA's CenterDiscovery, Development, and Regulation of Natural Productshttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/5642423for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and a drug identification number (DIN) before itcan be sold.5.3.1.2. CanadaIn Canada, the term \u201ccosmeceutical\u201d (used to describe a cosmetic product with pharmaceuti\u2010cal-like benefits) is not employed by Health Canada [122]. Therefore cosmeceuticals fall undereither cosmetics or drugs (depending on the claims made and/or the composition of theproduct) and are subject to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act and its CosmeticRegulations regarding composition, safety, labeling and advertising and they are subject tothe provisions of the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act and Regulations [122]. The threemost significant features of the Canadian cosmetic regulatory system are mandatory notifica\u2010tion of all cosmetic products, safety of ingredients and products, and product labeling [122].According to Health Canada, a \"cosmetic\" is defined as \"any substance or mixture of substan\u2010ces, manufactured, sold or represented for use in cleansing, improving or altering the complexion, skin,hair or teeth and includes deodorants and perfumes\u201d [122].5.3.2. European UnionIn Europe, EMA guidelines place a clear demarcation between drugs and cosmetics, wherebya cosmetic is a product that is to be applied topically with an intended cosmetic function andproducts cannot fall under both categories, unlike in the US [116]. On November 30th (2009),the new Cosmetic Products Regulation, EU Regulation 1223/2009 was adopted, replacing theCosmetics Directive [123]. With the new Cosmetics Regulation, Europe claims to have a robust,internationally recognized regime, which reinforces product safety taking into considerationthe latest technological developments [123]. Most of the provisions of this new regulation willbe applicable as of July 11th, 2013 [123].6. ConclusionA natural product or secondary metabolite is a pharmacologically or biologically activechemical compound or substance, which is found in nature and produced by a living organism.The lengthy process of natural products evolution has resulted in optimal interactions withbiological macromolecules and targets. Historically, natural substances have been the mostproductive source of active compounds and chemical lead structures. Natural products havetraditionally provided a large fraction of the drugs in use today and millions of terrestrial andmarine plants, organisms and microorganisms provide an immense resource to discoverunprecedented novel bioactive scaffolds. These have the potential to serve as medical treat\u2010ments or templates for new therapeutics and may be suitable for production via a syntheticroutes or in a heterologous system like E. coli. About half of the agents in today\u2019s arsenal ofmarketed drugs are derived from biological sources with the large majority being based onterrestrial natural product scaffolds. Approximately 50% of the new drugs introduced since1994 were either natural products or derived from natural products. As of today, only a veryUsing Old Solutions to New Problems - Natural Drug Discovery in the 21st Century24small fraction of bioactive structures of potential therapeutic relevance from plants, microbes,and marine organisms have been chemically analyzed or examined in a broad panel ofscreening models or bioassays. The discovery of valuable therapeutic agents from naturalsources continues in the 21th century by reaching into new and untapped terrestrial and marinesource organisms as the chemical novelty associated with natural products is higher than thatof structures from any other source.There is growing awareness of the limited structural diversity in existing compound collec\u2010tions and the extreme chemical diversity, the high biological potency, and the potential tofrequently discover drug-like characteristics in natural products. Therefore, they constitute avaluable platform for the development of new therapeutics for a variety of indications, al\u2010though they may still not contain enough versatility to yield suitable treatments for all herit\u2010able human diseases.As some major pharmaceutical companies terminated their natural product programs, thefuture role to discover and feed candidates into the development pipelines will resideincreasingly with research institutes and small biotech companies. Over a hundred new drugcandidates from natural sources like plants, bacteria, fungi and animals or obtained semi-synthetically are in clinical development with a similar number in preclinical development.They target a variety of indications, mainly cancer and infectious diseases (bacterial, viral,fungal, and parasitic) but also other therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular diseases,neurological illnesses and depression, metabolic diorders and inflammatory diseases.Natural products, although a valuable and precious resource, also come with their fair shareof challenges concerning the provision of sufficient amounts of pure enough material fordiscovery and development activities. As mentioned earlier, such apprehensions are based onthe threat of losing potentially valuable natural sources through extinction resulting fromdeforestation of large landmasses, environmental pollution in remote areas as well as globalwarming. Countries are also increasingly protective of their natural assets in flora and faunaand may not authorize the collection of sample species without significant demands and verydifficult negotiations. The regulatory requirements for different product categories containingnatural substances like pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmeceuticals vary from ratherstringent over generous to non-existent at an international level. Even if natural healthproducts or dietary supplements are considered as or expected to be safe, they may still carrypotential risks in themselves or through interactions with prescription or OTC drugs. There\u2010fore, the discovery and development of natural products require cientific validation andsufficient pharmacoepidemiological evidence to support their safety and efficacy.AcknowledgementsFunding for the publication of this chapter was provided by the School of Business Adminis\u2010tration and the Centre for Health and Biotech Management Research, University of PrinceEdward Island, Charlottetown, PE, Canada.
