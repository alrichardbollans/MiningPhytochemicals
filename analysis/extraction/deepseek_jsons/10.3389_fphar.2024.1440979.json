Education, HeilongjiangUniversity of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, ChinaChelidonium majus L. (C. majus), commonly known as \u201cBai Qu Cai\u201d in China,belongs to the genus Chelidonium of the Papaveraceae family. It has richmedicinal value, such as alleviating coughs, asthma, spasms and pain. Recentstudies have demonstrated that C. majus is abundant in various alkaloids, whichare the primary components of C. majus and have a range of pharmacologicaleffects, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumoreffects. So far, 94 alkaloids have been isolated from C. majus, includingbenzophenanthridine, protoberberine, aporphine, protopine and other typesof alkaloids. This paper aims to review the research progress inphytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of C. majus alkaloids, in orderto provide a theoretical basis for the application of C. majus in the field ofmedicinal chemistry and to afford reference for further research anddevelopment efforts.KEYWORDSChelidonium majus L., alkaloids, phytochemistry, pharmacological effect, toxicity1 IntroductionChelidonium majus L., a traditional medicinal plant from the Chelidonium genus of thePapaveraceae family, is a perennial herb extensively distributed in Europe, Asia, and Africa(Figure 1). It has been widely used as a traditional Chinese ethnic medicine for centuries andwas first documented in the \u201cHerbal for Relief of Famines.\u201d Known by various names infolklore, such as great celandine, swallow-wort, rock poppy, bai qu cai, tuhuanglian (\u571f\u9ec4\u8fde) and dunchangcao (\u65ad\u80a0\u8349), it mostly thrives on hillsides, valley forest edges, grasslands,roadsides, and rock crevices (Wei et al., 2009; Gilca et al., 2010). According to the onlinerecords of China\u2019s flora (http://www.cn-flora.ac.cn/index.html), the height of C. majus isapproximately 30\u201360 (\u2212100) cm. The stems are erect, multi-branched, and the branches arefrequently covered with small hairs and may exude yellow latex when broken. The leaf bladeis obovate-oblong or broadly obovate, 8\u201320 cm long. They are pinnatisect and divided into2\u20134 pairs of lobes with irregularly parted or lobed crenate margins, appearing glaucousabaxially and green adaxially. Additionally, the blade is sparsely pubescent abaxially andglabrous adaxially. Flower buds are oval, with a diameter of 5\u20138mm. The sepals are also ovalOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYIrina Ielciu,University of Medicine and Pharmacy IuliuHatieganu, RomaniaREVIEWED BYRamona Paltinean,University of Medicine and Pharmacy IuliuHatieganu, RomaniaMehmet Sarimahmut,Bursa Uluda\u011f University, T\u00fcrkiyePaul Owusu Donkor,University of Ghana, GhanaRobert Nawrot,Adam Mickiewicz University, Poland*CORRESPONDENCEZhi-Bin Wang,wzbmailbox@163.comHai-Xue Kuang,hxkuang@hljucm.edu.cn\u2020These authors have contributed equally to thiswork and share first authorshipRECEIVED 30 May 2024ACCEPTED 05 August 2024PUBLISHED 22 August 2024CITATIONLi X-L, Sun Y-P, Wang M, Wang Z-B andKuang H-X (2024) Alkaloids in Chelidoniummajus L: a review of its phytochemistry,pharmacology and toxicology.Front.

They may be glabrous orsparsely pubescent, and tend to be caducous. Petals are yellow,obovate, and entire, approximately 1 cm long. The capsule isnarrowly terete at 2\u20135 cm \u00d7 2-3 mm, with a pedicel usuallyshorter than the fruit. The seeds are dark brown, ovoid, about1 mm long or shorter, and have a shiny, alveolate appearance. Theflowering and fruiting period is from April to September.In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), C. majus is classified asa heat-clearing herb (Gilca et al., 2010). The 2020 edition of thePharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic of China describes C. majusas bitter, cool, and toxic, returning to the lung and stomachmeridians. The whole herb has the effect of relieving spasms andpain, coughs, and asthma. As extraction techniques have evolvedand advanced, significant progress in research on C. majus has beenmade. Various active ingredients of C. majus have been isolated andpurified, including alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, volatile oils,vitamin C, and other components (Kwasniewski, 1958; Colomboand Bosisio, 1996; Bai and Zhang, 2009). Pharmacological studieshave shown that its active components exhibit wide-rangingpharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor effects (Hong et al., 2022).Further studies have identified that the major active compounds ofC. majus are isoquinoline alkaloids (Colombo and Bosisio, 1996),including benzophenanthridine, protoberberine, aporphine,protopine, and other types (Tom\u00e8 and Colombo, 1995). As ahemicryptophyte, the concentration of alkaloids in C. majuscontinues to accumulate with changes in light (Tom\u00e8 andColombo, 1995). These alkaloids are found in concentrationsranging from 0.27% to 2.25% in aerial parts and 3%\u20134% in theroots (Maji and Banerji, 2015), with varying alkaloid content acrossdifferent plant organs. Compared to the aerial parts andunderground parts, the total content of alkaloids in the leaves islower, while the content in latex is 32 times higher than in leaves and9 times higher than in roots (Tom\u00e8 and Colombo, 1995). Thesefindings suggest that the alkaloid content in plant organs isinfluenced by the number of laticifers where they are stored(Zieli\u0144ska et al., 2018). Despite extensive literature reviews, wehave not yet found any article that provides a comprehensiveand detailed review of the alkaloids of C. majus. Therefore, thispaper focuses on the alkaloids of C. majus, reviewing researchprogress in phytochemistry, pharmacological effects, andtoxicology. The aim is to provide a reference for the applicationof C. majus in medicinal drugs, which is extremely significant for thefurther advancement of traditional ethnic medicine.2 MethodologyTo comprehensively understand the research status of C. majus,we conducted a thorough literature search using various electronicdatabases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, andChina National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Additionally,we referred to other literature sources, such as Pharmacopoeia ofthe People\u2019s Republic of China, to obtain relevant informationabout the alkaloids in C. majus. This article exclusively utilizesChinese and English texts. The keywords employed were C.majus L., alkaloids, phytochemistry, pharmacological effects,and toxicity. As of May 2024, a total of 915 relevant literaturesources were retrieved. To ensure the accuracy and relevance ofthe review, we conducted screening based on the title, abstract,and full text of the article. Duplicate articles, conferenceabstracts, and unavailable articles have been excluded.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979Additionally, articles with research purposes not relevant to thetopic of this review, as well as non-English and non-Chinesearticles, have also been excluded.

In addition, some scholars have reported that C. majusalso contains flavonoids, triterpenoids, volatile oils, and othercomponents. Isoquinoline alkaloids are a class of alkaloidsderived from phenylalanine or tyrosine, which are abundant inquantity and complex in structure, providing a rich material basisfor the pharmacological effects of C. majus. At present, 94 alkaloidshave been isolated and identified from C. majus, which can becategorized into benzophenanthridines, protoberberines,aporphines, protopines, and other alkaloids based on theircarbon skeletons (Figure 2) (Geren\u010der et al., 2006; Wei et al.,2009). Among them, the three main alkaloid groups, includingbenzophenanthridines, protoberberines, and protopines, belong tobenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, and aporphines belong toisoquinoline alkaloids, which are considered to be the activeingredients of C. majus and exhibit significant pharmacologicalactivity (Tuzimski and Petruczynik, 2023; Zwerger et al., 2024).The concentrations of these alkaloids differ according to the plantparts and growth conditions, but they generally have highmedicinal value. This section provides information on the types,molecular formulas, plant parts, and references of these alkaloidsisolated from C. majus.3.1 Benzophenanthridine alkaloidsBenzophenanthridine alkaloids are classified as isoquinolinealkaloids, characterized by a tetracyclic structural motif, andrepresent an important category of nitrogen-containing smallmolecules (Bisai et al., 2019). These alkaloids are a common inthe Papaveraceae family and are the most abundant and importantcomponents in C. majus. Currently, 55 alkaloids (1\u201355) have beenidentified and extracted from C. majus. The skeletal structureconsists of one isoquinoline nucleus and two benzene rings.The benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated and identified fromC. majus can be further divided into four structural typesaccording to the degree of unsaturated skeleton:dihydrobenzophenthridine, hexahydrobenzophenthridine,dimindihydrobenzophenthridine and benzophenanthrinequaternary amine (Table 1; Figure 3) (Wei et al., 2009; Bisaiet al., 2019; Laines-Hidalgo et al., 2022). These alkaloids arestructurally variable due to their N-atom content and have beenreported to have a wide range of pharmacological activities (Weiet al., 2021), with significant anti-inflammatory, analgesic, andantitumor activities (Han et al., 2016).TABLE 1 (Continued) Benzophenanthridine alkaloids compounds isolated from Chelidonium majus L.No. Compound name Formula Part of the plant Ref.36 Methoxychelidonine C21H21NO6 Root Kaczmarek and Malek (1959)37 Norchelidonine C19H17NO5 Whole plant Kadan et al.

They are synthesized in plants through a series ofcomplex enzymatic reactions using tyrosine as a substrate (Liuet al., 2023). This type of alkaloid is composed of two fusedisoquinoline rings, primarily in the form of hydrochloride.FIGURE 3Chemical structures of benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated from Chelidonium majus L. (The numbers in Figure 3 refer to the numbers ofalkaloids present in Table 1).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979Protoberberine alkaloids are abundantly present in nature, withC. majus containing a relatively high content of thesecompounds. Currently, 21 protoberberine compounds (56\u201376)have been isolated from this plant (Table 2; Figure 4). In clinicalpractice, this class of alkaloids demonstrates a range of biologicalactivities, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatoryproperties. These alkaloids exhibit various beneficial effects inthe field of medicine.3.3 Aporphine alkaloidsAporphine alkaloids are natural compounds that are widelydistributed in nature and have important biological activities.This group of alkaloids belongs to isoquinoline alkaloids, whichis an important type of natural alkaloids (Lin et al., 2020). Thesealkaloids are composed of four fused hexagonal rings, formed byconnecting the C-2 position of the benzyl part of thebenzylisoquinoline and the C-8 position of the isoquinolinepart and eliminating one hydrogen molecule. A total of6 species of aporphine alkaloids have been isolated andidentified (Table 3; Figure 5). Aporphine alkaloids exhibitvarious pharmacological effects, including antioxidant,antiviral, and antitumor activities.3.4 Protopine alkaloidsProtopine alkaloids are a class of isoquinoline alkaloids with ten-membered nitrogen heterocycles formed by protoberberine alkaloidsthrough N- methylation and ring splitting in the biosyntheticpathway. The most noticeable characteristic of these compounds isC-14 carbonylation. These natural isoquinoline alkaloids possess afundamental three-ring structure, comprising two benzene rings (Aand C rings) and one ten-membered nitrogen heterocyclic ring (Bring) (Paul and Maurer, 2003). Currently, 4 species of protopinealkaloids have been isolated fromC.majus (83\u201386) (Table 3; Figure 5).3.5 Other alkaloidsIn addition to the above four groups of alkaloids, otheralkaloids have been reported. For example, Kaczmarek andMalek isolated sparteine by paper chromatography (Kaczmarekand Malek, 1959); Kadan G et al. isolated (\u2212)-turkiyenine from thedried whole plant (Kadan et al., 1990); Yuan et al. obtainednoroxyhydrastinine, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and flazin (Yuanet al., 2022); Kim et al. identified N-trans-feruloyltyramine andarnottianamide (Kim et al., 2015); and Huang et al. extractedchelidoniumine from the aerial part of C. majus.

This paper explores the alkaloids of C. majus,which are widely found in numerous plants and significantly impacthuman health. As research on C. majus deepens, its alkaloidcomponents have been found to interact with multiple biologicaltargets, exerting therapeutic effects on various diseases. These includeantibacterial, antifungal, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic,expectorant, anti-cough, anti-asthma, and anti-liver fibrosis activities.4.1 Anti-bacterial effectStudies conducted in the past few years have shown that thealkaloids in C. majus have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects.Chelerythrine (CHE), extracted from C. majus, exhibits a strongantibacterial effect on Streptococcus mutans, the main caries-causing bacterium in the oral cavity. It effectively reduces theadhesion ability of S. mutans, suggesting its potential use as apreventative treatment for dental caries (Chen et al., 2011).Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus(MRSA) are common clinical pathogens. 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine (HHS) and 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine (HHC), solated from C. majus, haveshown significant inhibition against MRSA strains, with minimalinhibitory concentrations/minimal bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) of MRSA strains ranging from 0.49\u201315.63/1.95\u201362.50 \u03bcg/mL(Zuo et al., 2008). Sanguinarine (SNG) disrupts the cytoplasmicmembrane, causing cell lysis, and is effective against MRSA, withMIC values between 3.12 \u03bcg/mL and 1.56 \u03bcg/mL, and the activityrange was found to be between 3.12 \u03bcg/mL and 6.25 \u03bcg/mL (Obiang-Obounou et al., 2011). Remarkably, a study confirmed that SNG,CHE, and their derivatives exhibit robust antibacterial effects againstS. aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Aeromonas hydrophila (Miaoet al., 2011). Another study evaluated the antimicrobial potential ofthe major alkaloids in C. majus and found that C. majus was mosteffective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of 1.9 mg/L), whileSNG showed effectiveness against S. aureus (MIC of 1.9 mg/L)(Zieli\u0144ska et al., 2019). Moreover, chelidonine (CHLD), SNG, andCHE also demonstrated inhibitory effects on E. coli (M\u00f3ricz et al.,2015). These antibacterial effects have been summarized in Table 4.4.2 Anti-fungal effectThe alkaloids and derivatives in C. majus exhibit significantantifungal activity, and the mechanism of action has gradually beenrevealed. This provides innovative insights and approaches for thedevelopment of new antifungal agents and the control of agriculturaldiseases. CHE induces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species(ROS) by increasing the intracellular calcium concentration inmycelium, thus inhibiting the growth of Candida albicansmycelium, with MIC values ranging from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/mL (GongFIGURE 4Chemical structures of protoberberine alkaloids isolated from Chelidonium majus L. (The numbers in Figure 4 refer to the numbers of alkaloidspresent in Table 2).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979et al., 2019). Furthermore, Wei QH\u2019s experiment studied the in vitroantifungal activity of CHE against five rice pathogenic fungi. Theresults indicated that the EC50 values for Ustilaginoidea virens andCochliobolus miyabeanus were 6.53 \u00d7 10\u22123 mg/mL and 5.62 \u00d710\u22123 mg/mL, respectively (Wei et al., 2020). These antifungaleffects have been summarized in Table 4.4.3 Anti-viral effectThe yellow latex of C. majus is widely used in folk medicine totreat human papillomavirus (HPV) because of its antiviralproperties. Recent studies have found that its antiviral effect ismainly attributed to the alkaloid and protein componentscontained in the latex, which can target different stages of thevirus replication cycle, effectively reducing HPV infection, andsuppressing the expression of the viral oncogenes (E6, E7) at themRNA and protein levels (Musidlak et al., 2022). Moreover, CHEcan directly target the gB and gD glycoproteins on the surface ofHSV-1, thereby inhibiting HSV-1 infection by preventing thebinding of the virus to cells (Hu et al., 2023). In addition to itseffect on human viruses, C. majus can also be employed for theprevention and control of agricultural plant virus es. Three alkaloidsisolated from C. majus have shown activity against Tobacco mosaicvirus (TMV). CHE and CHLD significantly inhibit TMV, while SNGmoderately reduces TMV infection, thereby mitigating virus-induced damage in plants (Guo et al., 2021).4.4 Analgesic effectThe alkaloids in C. majus exhibit significant analgesic effects oninflammatory pain, cancer-related pain, peripheral neuralgia andother types of pain, demonstrating high clinical application value. Atpresent, C. majus is used as the main ingredient in clinical analgesicdrugs. For example, Weitongshu capsules alleviate pain associatedwith gastric ulcers, and the compound Chinese medicine Tonganinjection treats cancer pain caused by radiotherapy andchemotherapy or non-radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Theanalgesic mechanism of C. majus extract is different from that ofmorphine, indicating that it does not act as a narcotic analgesic andis devoid of side effects such as addiction, showing peripheralanalgesic effects that are highly valued in clinical application (Liet al., 2013). CHE is one of the primary constituents of C. majus, andprogress has been made in understanding its analgesic mechanism.It mitigates the occurrence of neuropathic pain by inhibiting theactivation of PKC and spinal cord astrocytes (Chen et al., 2014).

(2019)Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979combination of network pharmacology and molecular dockingtechnology revealed that alkaloids in C. majus mainly inducecentral analgesia through a network mode of multiple targetinterventions, targeting SRC, AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, and MAPK3,resulting in anti-functional abdominal pain effects (Zhanget al., 2023).4.5 Anti-inflammatory effectInflammation is common in clinical practice, making thestudy of anti-inflammatory drugs essential. CHE can inhibitthe production of PGE2 by modulating COX-2, a crucialenzyme in the response to inflammation, thus exerting ananti-inflammatory effect (Niu et al., 2011). The tumor necrosisfactor (TNF)-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signalingpathway has been discovered in some types of inflammation,among which the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway is a well-studied typicalinflammatory signaling pathway and the core of coordinatinginflammatory immune response. CHE was found to mitigate theinflammatory response of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducedserum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NO production in mouse modelsof endotoxin shock (Li et al., 2012). Another study found thatCHE protects against LPS-induced acute lung injury, inhibits theproduction of inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, and reduces pulmonary edema and neutrophil infiltration.The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of NF-\u03baBactivation and interference with the nuclear translocation ofNrf2 protein (Fan et al., 2018). CHE also significantly reducesthe gastric ulcer index, inhibits NO concentration, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in serum and gastric mucosa of mice with gastric ulcers,while markedly attenuating the overexpression of NF-\u03baB in thegastric mucosa to exert anti-inflammatory activity (Li et al.,2014). CHE is used to treat mice with acetic acid-inducedulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel illness, by blockingthe generation of NO and TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory cytokines (Xuet al., 2014; Wu et al., 2022). It has also been found that CHE canpromote apoptosis and autophagy in rheumatoid arthritis byinfluencing the expression of genes related to autophagy andapoptosis (including Bax, Bcl-2, PARP, and ULK1) and theAMPK/mTOR/ULK-1 signaling pathway, thus inhibitingrheumatoid arthritis in vivo and in vitro (Cai et al., 2022). Inaddition, it regulates key signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and p38 MAPK activity)to prevent excessive inflammatory immune responses (Valipouret al., 2021).Several researchers have also isolated 6-acetonyl-5,6-dihydrosanguinarine (ADS) from C. majus and discovered thatFIGURE 5Chemical structures of aporphine, protopine and other alkaloids isolated from Chelidoniummajus L. (The numbers in Figure 5 refer to the numbersof alkaloids present in Table 3).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979ADS can induce the production of the inflammatory cytokinesTNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 by macrophages and dendritic cells. Theseinflammatory cytokines are important for the inflammatoryresponse, and their excessive production often leads to theaggravation of inflammation and the development of diseases.ADS can trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokinesthrough the ROS-JNK/ERK-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, thusinhibiting the occurrence of the inflammatory response (Kimet al., 2013).Furthermore, CHLD exhibits significant anti-inflammatoryactions, inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory responses in vitroand in vivo by blocking the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway inRAW264.7 macrophages (Liao et al., 2018). It has beenexperimentally demonstrated that inhibiting TNF-inducedNF-\u03baB activation and modulating NF-\u03baB regulatory geneproducts display anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-invasion effects. Therefore, CHLD canalleviate the inflammatory response in HCT 116 human coloncancer cells (Zhang et al., 2018). CHLD inhibits IL-1\u03b2-mediatedinflammation by modulating the NF-\u03baB pathway in vitro,thereby preventing cartilage degeneration and synovialinflammation in rats with osteoarthritis (Li et al., 2023). Inparticular, CHLD also suppresses the production of IL-4, IL-17, eotaxin-2, and Ovalbumin-specific IgE through theSTAT6 and FOXP3 pathways and can be used to treat airwayinflammation (Kim et al., 2015). CHLD can preventinflammatory damage in porcine small intestinal epithelialcell line IPEC-J2 cells by significantly reducing pro-inflammatory factors and promoting IL-10 expression (Linet al., 2024).In addition to the above two alkaloids, there may be otheringredients in C. majus with anti-inflammatory activities. Thesecomponents might influence the inflammatory response throughdifferent mechanisms, thereby synergistically enhancing the anti-inflammatory effects of C. majus. The anti-inflammatory actions ofthese alkaloids were examined in macrophage RAW264.7 cells toascertain their inhibitory impact on the production of NO caused byLPS. CHLD and HHS exhibited strong inhibitory activities on NOproduction in LPS-induced macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (Parket al., 2011). The impact of five alkaloids on the secretion of IL-1\u03b2,IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes(neutrophils) was determined. It was found that berberine,CHLD, and CHE notably reduced TNF-\u03b1 secretion in aconcentration-dependent manner, while SNG inhibited IL-1\u03b2secretion and coptisine slightly decreased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8secretion (Zieli\u0144ska et al., 2020). In another study, stylopine wasfound to inhibit macrophage NO in a concentration-dependentmanner by suppressing the expression of iNOS, COX-2, NO, andPGE2, which may be related to the anti-inflammatory activities of C.majus (Jang et al., 2004).4.6 Anti-cancer effectCancer is currently the primary cause of disease-related deathin humans, and both its incidence and mortality are rising globally(Chen et al., 2024). Therefore, research and treatment of cancer areparticularly urgent. Researchers both domestically and overseashave carried out a significant number of in vitro and in vivoexperiments on the anti-tumor effects of C. majus in recentTABLE 4 The anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects of alkaloids from Chelidonium majus L.Compounds Models Positive control Results Ref.Anti-bacterialChelerythrine Streptococcus mutans Exhibited inhibitory activity Chen et al.

Studies have indicated that alkaloids extracted and isolatedfrom C. majus have significant biological activities in anti-tumortreatment, inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion oftumor cells through various mechanisms. These alkaloids play ananti-cancer role in cervical cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, andother cancers by promoting apoptosis, altering the cell cycle,inducing autophagy, and activating mitochondrial apoptosis.These anti-cancer effects have been summarized in Table 5.4.6.1 Liver cancerIsoquinoline alkaloids in C. majus have anti-telomerase activity,a key target of therapeutic intervention in cancer cells.

CHLD inhibitsthe epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, enhances theapoptotic effect of lenvatinib on HCC cells in nude mice, andreduces the in vivo growth of hepatocellular carcinoma tumors(Hou et al., 2019). Another study indicated that chelerythrinechloride (CHECL) significantly inhibits SMMC-7721 cellproliferation in a time-and dose-dependent manner by blockingthe S-phase of SMMC-7721 cells, and activating the mitochondrialapoptosis pathway by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 familyproteins, thus inducing apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells (Zhanget al., 2011). CHECL also inhibits growth, invasion, andmigration in the highly metastatic human hepatocellularcarcinoma cell line MHCC97-H (Cheng et al., 2019).Additionally, CHE upregulates the relative expression of Bax andCaspase-3 proteins and mRNA, decreases the relative expression ofBcl-XL protein and mRNA, prevents proliferation inHepG2 hepatoma cells, and ultimately induces apoptosis (Hanand Zhu, 2016). Experiments by Lin\u2019s team showed that CHEexposure induces excess ROS generation and triggers oxidativestress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways in HepG2 cells,ultimately causing apoptosis in HepG2 cells (Lin et al., 2022).4.6.2 Lung cancerLung cancer (LC) is a serious health problem that can lead tosignificant morbidity and mortality. In the treatment of LC, CHEcan reduce tumor growth in Lewis lung cancer transplanted mice bytargeting the NF-\u03baB/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway and down-regulating the expression levels of NF-\u03baB and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins,thereby achieving a therapeutic effect (Jin and Lu, 2024). Clinicalfindings indicate that the majority of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients exhibit mutations in the epidermal growth factorreceptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR), leading to increased EGFR activityand facilitating metastasis and progression of NSCLC (Jiang et al.,2022). Targeted therapy directed at mutant forms of EGFR, such asthe small molecule inhibitor Gefitinib, has shown successfulapplication in the treatment of NSCLC patients. Clinical datasupports its efficacy in significantly prolonging patient survival;however, prolonged use often leads to acquired resistance inmost individuals (Bai et al., 2019). Therefore, researchers foundthat CHLD can inhibit the growth of Gefitinib-resistant non-smallcell LC cells by modulating the EGFR-AMPK signaling pathway.They also found that CHLD mediates apoptosis through themitochondrial pathway by decreasing the expression of AKT andBcl-2 and increasing the cleavage of Bax and Caspase-3 expression(Xie et al., 2020).4.6.3 Gastric cancerGastric cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating in the upperlining of the stomach. CHE can effectively induce apoptosis inhuman gastric cancer (BGC 823) cells, and this apoptosis is cellcycle-dependent (Zong and Liu, 2006). In another study, CHECLwas found to inhibit cell proliferation in a time - and dose-dependent manner, causing cell cycle arrest and, apoptosis inBGC-823 cells through the reduction of mitochondrial membranepotential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3,disruption of PARP, and dysregulation of BCL-2 family proteins(Zhang et al., 2012). Additionally, CHLD can induce SFC-7901 Mphase arrest and mitotic slippage in human gastric cancer cells bydown-regulating the expression of BubR1, Cdk1 and cyclinB1 proteins (Qu et al., 2016).4.6.4 Renal cell carcinomaRenal cell carcinoma is among the ten most prevalent cancers inhumans. CHLD has been found to regulate the expression ofproteins Smad3 and Smad7 in the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway toinhibit tumor proliferation in tumor-bearing mice with renal cellcarcinoma (Pan et al., 2023). Chen et al. (2016) also demonstratedthat CHECLmay induce apoptosis in renal cancer cells by inhibitingERK activity.4.6.5 Breast cancerBreast cancer (BC) is a disease that threatens human life andhealth worldwide. According to TCM, BC belongs to the category of\u201cru yong\u201d and \u201cru shi yong,\" mainly caused by the deficiency ofzheng qi and the imbalance of yin and yang in the viscera (Liu et al.,2021). CHLD is highly cytotoxic to cancer cells and induces MCF-7BC cell death by potently inhibiting telomerase activity andstimulating multiple mechanisms of cell death, includingapoptosis, autophagy, and senescence (Noureini and Esmaili,2014). In addition, CHLD demonstrates anti-migration and anti-invasion effects in MDA-MB-231 BC cells by preventing theformation of the integrin-linked kinase/PINCH/\u03b1-parvin complex(Kim et al., 2015). CHE can play an anti-BC role through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2021). CHLD inhibits themitosis of BC cells by inducing M-phase arrest and blocking theAKT/FOXO3/FOXM1 axis, thus exerting anti-BC effects (Li et al.,2024). Chelidonium Herba-Corydalis Rhizoma is one of thecommonly used prescriptions for BC in TCM. It can suppressthe expression of ER\u03b1, p-PI3K, p-Akt protein, and ESR1 mRNA,as well as inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells (IC50 value: 693 \u03bcg/mL),suggesting that its anti-ER-positive BC effect may be connected tothe modulation of ER and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (Zouet al., 2023).4.6.6 Cervical cancerCHE has been proven to exert anti-tumor effects by inducingapoptosis in HeLa cells through activation of the P38/JNK signalingpathway (Yu et al., 2000). Chelerythrine hydrochloride inhibits theproliferation of cervical cancer HeLa cells by triggeringmitochondrial apoptosis via the PI3K/BAD signaling pathway(Yang et al., 2020). Another isoquinoline alkaloid, CHLD, hasalso shown effectiveness in triggering apoptosis in HeLa cells,exerting anti-cancer effects by upregulating the expression ofpro-apoptotic genes such as, p38 and p53 and downregulatingthe expression of anti-apoptotic genes including AKT, PI3K,JAK3, STAT3, E6, and E7 (Paul et al., 2012). Protoberberinealkaloids (coptisine, berberine, and their derivatives, likestylopine) isolated from C. majus have demonstrated anti-cervicalcancer activity by interfering with reactive oxygen speciesproduction, intracellular caspase activation, and mitochondrialfunction (Warowicka et al., 2019). The main latex proteins in C.majus, along with berberine, 8-hydroxycheleritrine, anddihydroberberine, can reduce the in vitro activity of humanFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979cervical cancer cells (both HPV-negative and HPV-positive) andsynergistically play an anti-cancer role (Nawrot et al., 2021). SNGhas long been considered an anti-tumor drug; studies have shownthat it induces death in HeLa cells by activating apoptosis andferroptosis (Alakkal et al., 2022).4.6.7 Ovarian cancerOvarian cancer, often termed the \u201csilent killer\u201d due to its highmortality rate, shows promising response to SNG in epithelialovarian cancer cells by controlling the CASC2-EIF4A3 axis,blocking NF-\u03baB signaling, or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway(Zhang et al., 2018). Meanwhile, research on CHE indicates itseffectiveness in inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion ofhuman Ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells, preventing or alleviating theoccurrence of SKOV3 cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, andsuppressing tumor metastasis (Zhou et al., 2024).4.6.8 LeukemiaCHE and dihydrochelerythrine have been shown to arrest thecell cycle of HL-60 cells in the G1 phase, alter cell cycledistribution, and activate the mitochondrial apoptosispathway, inducing apoptosis and necrosis in human leukemiaHL-60 cells (Vrba et al., 2008). Studies have also indicated thatCHE and SNG induce dose-dependent DNA damage andincreased cytotoxicity in primary mouse spleen cells andmouse Lymphpocytic Leukemia L1210 cells, while CHLD doesnot exhibit significant cytotoxic or DNA damaging effects onthese cells but can completely inhibit the growth of L1210 cells(Kaminskyy et al., 2008). Moreover, the Havelek R teamconfirmed significant cytotoxicity of CHLD andhomochelidonine, effectively inducing leukemia cell death(Havelek et al., 2016). SNG, berberine, and C. majus extractshave also exhibited significant cytotoxic and pro-apoptoticactivities against hematopoietic cell lines HL-60, HL-60/MX1,HL-60/MX2, CCRF/CEM and CEM/C1, J45.01, and U266B,suggesting their potential utility in treating various types ofleukemia (Och et al., 2019).4.6.9 MelanomaMelanoma, a type of skin cancer originating from the malignanttransformation of melanocytes, is concerning due to its malignancyand treatment challenges. CHE inhibits the proliferation of B16 cellsin a dose- and time-dependent manner significantly increases theearly and late apoptosis rates of B16 cells, and upregulates theexpression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax genes, while reducing theexpression levels of Bcl-2 genes. It has been demonstrated that CHEsuppresses the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway,thereby slowing B16 cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis(Zhang et al., 2018). Experimental data have shown that uvealmelanoma cells undergo necrotic cell death and apoptosis whenexposed to benzophenanthine alkaloids (SNG, CHE, and CHLD)(Kem\u00e9ny-Beke et al., 2006). Furthermore, benzphenanthridinealkaloids, including chelilutine, CHE, and SNG, exhibit a strongantiproliferative effect on malignant melanoma cells; these alkaloidsinduce apoptosis by reducing levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and xIAP), leading to decreased mitochondrialmembrane potential and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP(Hammerov\u00e1 et al., 2011).4.6.10 Nasopharyngeal carcinomaSNG, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, synergistically inhibitsthe growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma grafts in vivo, inducingautophagy and apoptosis related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalingpathway (Peng et al., 2022). SNG inhibits the growth of humannasopharyngeal carcinoma 5\u20138 F cells, induces autophagy, andsuppresses proliferation by activating AMPK/mTOR signaling (Suet al., 2022). Experiments confirm that both SNG and CHE inhibitnasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation and induce apoptosisby regulating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways (Chenet al., 2024).4.6.11 OthersCHLD increases the growth of the human oral epithelioid cancercell line KB in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and inhibitsKB cells invasion in a dose-dependent manner. It upregulates Baxexpression and decreases Bcl-2 expression, activating Caspase-3 andinducing KB cell apoptosis. This effect may be mediated throughdual inhibition of Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, inhibitingBcl-2 expression and promoting Caspase-3 expression, therebysuppressing cancer cell proliferation, fostering apoptosis, andimpeding tumor growth and metastasis (Tao and Ran, 2018).Moreover, CHLD induces G2/M phase block in BxPC-3 andMIA PaCa-2 cells by downregulating CDK 1, and increasesS-phase block induced by GADD 45a by upregulating p21 andp53, culminating in pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis throughCaspase-3 cleavage (Jang et al., 2021). Dihydrosanguinarineexhibits inhibitory effects on K-Ras and TP53 mutant pancreaticcancer cell lines by bidirectionally modulating mut-p53/-Ras andWT-p53/-Ras proteins (Wu et al., 2019). CHLD induces apoptosisin human glioblastoma cells through G2/M phase arrest and Mcl-1degradation (Lee et al., 2019). CHE triggers apoptosis by activatingROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in colorectal cancer cells(Liu and Jiang, 2019). CHE effectively inhibits the growth andproliferation of adenoid cystic carcinoma cells and inducesapoptosis by increasing ROS levels and upregulating NF-\u03baB,p-JNK and p-p38 expression in cells (Li et al., 2021).4.7 Anti-hepatic fibrosis effectThe mRNA expression of TGF-1, Smad3, Smad4, and thenegative regulator Smad7 varied significantly following differentdoses of CHE in the mouse model of carbon tetrachloride-inducedhepatic fibrosis, suggesting that CHE could inhibit the signaling ofthe TGF-\u03b2 receptor complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.Additionally, CHE interfered with the expression of TGF-\u03b21,Smad4, and Smad7 proteins, further confirming its inhibitoryeffect on hepatic fibrosis in mice, associated with the TGF-\u03b2/Smads signaling pathway (Li et al., 2018). After administeringdifferent doses of CHLD to rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis, the protein phosphorylation levels ofPI3K, Akt, mTOR, and mRNA expression levels ofcorresponding genes in their tissues were increased to varyingdegrees. This indicates that CHLD can regulate the mRNA andprotein expression of genes related to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway,affecting the expression of autophagy marker proteins LC3 and p62,preventing the activation of hepatic stellate cells, and inhibiting liverFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979fibrosis (Li et al., 2021). Using TGF-\u03b21-activated rat hepatic stellatecells CFSC-8B as a model of hepatic fibrosis, it was observed thatCHLD inhibited the proliferation of TGF-\u03b21-activated hepaticstellate cells, further demonstrating its potential to reverse liverfibrosis (Li et al., 2019).4.8 Anti-alzheimer effectAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerativedisease with an insidious onset that causes neuronal damage in thebrain, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioralchanges. Acetylcholinesterase plays a critical role in nerve function,as it is a serine protease produced by motor neurons and musclejunctions that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine intoacetic acid and choline, thereby terminating nerve impulses.Decreased levels of acetylcholine are a key factor in the onset ofAD. Two compounds, HHC and HHS, isolated from C. majus,exhibit strong inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase. Theyslow down the breakdown of acetylcholine and increase its levels inthe brain. Therefore, these compounds have been suggested aspotential alternatives to anti-dementia drugs (Cho et al., 2006).4.9 Anthelmintic effectChelidonium majus not only holds medicinal value, but alsoserves as a pesticide. Plant-derived alkaloid insecticides are crucialcomponents of plant pesticides, showing significant repellent andinsecticidal activities against numerous pests. CHLD has been foundto possess substantial anthelmintic activity against Dactylogyrusintermedius, achieving a 100% anthelmintic effect at 0.9 mg L\u22121. TheEC50 value after 48 h of exposure (the concentration required toachieve a 50% deworming effect) was 0.48 mg L\u22121 (Yao et al., 2011).The insecticidal mechanisms of alkaloids in C. majus are diverse,contributing to larvicidal effects by disrupting enzyme activity,reducing food intake, affecting nutritional indexes, anddownregulating mRNA expression of enzyme genes (Zou et al.,2017). In another study, alkaloids in C. majus induced resistance todietary intake and larval mortality in Lymantria dispar by inhibitingfood intake and digestive enzymes (Zou et al., 2019).4.10 Other effectsIn the isolated ileal spasmolytic test model of guinea pigs, CHLDand protopine, when their concentration reaches 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 g/mL, cansignificantly induce ileal relaxation in response to barium chloridestimulation, with relaxation rates reaching 68.8% and 54.8%,respectively (Hiller et al., 1998). The DPPH free radicalscavenging rate was determined using the DPPH method, withascorbic acid as a positive control to evaluate the antioxidativeactivity of CHE solid dispersion (SD). The results showed thatdifferent mass concentrations of CHE-PEG-SD exhibited certainDPPH radical scavenging ability (IC50 = 0.124 mg/mL), albeitweaker than ascorbic acid (IC50 = 0.041 mg/mL) (Wang et al.,2020). Traditional medicine traditions utilize natural small-molecule compounds from C. majus to treat variousgynecological disorders, including coptisine, protopine, berberine,and dihydroberberine (Lans et al., 2018). Supplementation with theprotoberberine-rich fraction from C. majus in the diet of rats withexperimentally induced endometriosis has been shown to inhibit therecurrence of endometriosis (Warowicka et al., 2021).5 ToxicologyThe utilization of plants and herbs in traditional medicine hasa long history, with many herbs used to treat various ailments.However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that not all herbs are harmless.Chelidonium majus was recorded as a toxic Chinese medicine inthe Chinese Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic of China(2020 edition). The alkaloids found in C. majus, including CHLD,SNG, berberine, coptisine, and CHE, either alone or incombination, possess potential toxicity (Benninger et al.,1999). Following evaluation using liver-targeted causalityassessment methods, several cases of hepatotoxicity werefound to be likely or highly likely related to C. majus.Therefore, the toxicity of C. majus to liver function has alwaysbeen a topic of concern, with some components potentiallycausing liver damage through different mechanisms. Thepotential hepatotoxicity of C. majus has also been confirmedin several reports from European countries, defining thishepatotoxicity as a unique form of herbal-induced liver injury(HILI) due to idiosyncratic metabolic reactions (Pantano et al.,2017). Ciornolutchii et al. reported two case studies in whichpatients exhibited liver damage after using pharmaceuticalpreparations containing C. majus, characterized by severehypertransaminasemia. Their literature review also identifiedmultiple HILI cases related to C. majus preparations(Ciornolutchii et al., 2024). The metabolism of CHLD wasstudied in a human liver microsomal model, revealing twodemethylated metabolites containing phenolic hydroxyl groupsafter incubation with liver microsomes. These hydroxyl groupsare easily oxidized into quinone compounds, which can combinewith glutathione to form quinone-sulfide, depleting glutathionein the liver and causing hepatotoxicity (Zhang et al., 2018).Alkaloids, in C. majus, such as CHE, SNG, berberine andcoptisine, have significant inhibitory effects on mitochondrialrespiration in mice, suppressing liver respiration by inhibitingmitochondrial enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase or succinicacid (Barreto et al., 2003). Furthermore, SNG induceschromosome breaks and DNA damage in mouse bone marrowcells (Das et al., 2004). Additionally, CHLD, berberine, and SNGfrom C. majus distinctly block hERG potassium channels, delayingheart repolarization and prolonging QT intervals, potentiallyincreasing the risk of death (Orvos et al., 2015). Chronicexposure to C. majus can also cause toxic effects in specificorgans; CHE has been observed to induce a dose-dependentlong-term toxicity in rat lung tissue, resulting in symptoms ofpulmonary congestion and bloody ascites (Liu et al., 2019).Despite C. majus having abundant pharmacological effects,caution should be exercised to avoid excessive or prolonged useto prevent toxic reactions.Chinese herbal medicines can be processed to reduce oreliminate drug toxicity and side effects, while also modifyingFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979drug function and flavor, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy.Researchers have processed C. majus and discovered that thecontent of SNG and CHE in licorice products derived from C.majus is significantly lower than in raw products. The optimalprocessing method involves using 15% licorice, moistening for3 h, and drying at 60\u00b0C for 12 h. This suggests that licoriceprocessing technology has a certain detoxification effect (Xiaoet al., 2021). In conclusion, although C. majus possessesnumerous pharmacological effects and holds certain applicationvalue in the pharmaceutical field, its potential toxicity risks must alsobe given sufficient attention. A deeper understanding of its efficacyand safety through scientific research is essential, and it should beused cautiously, with a full understanding of its potential risks toprevent toxic reactions from excessive or long-term use.6 DiscussionThis plant has been revered for its antibacterial, antiviral,antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological effects forcenturies. Alkaloids from C. majus, particularly benzophenanthridineand protoberberine alkaloids, show promising potential for applicationin anti-tumor therapy (Yang et al., 2024). Compounds such asCHE, CHLD, and SNG, known for their high content and notableanti-tumor activity, have been extensively studied. The alkaloidsexert anti-tumor effects by promoting apoptosis, altering the cellcycle, inducing autophagy, and activating mitochondrial apoptosis.Even alkaloids present in small amounts, such as berberine(Mohammadlou et al., 2021), dihydrochelerythrine (Silva et al.,2018), 6-methoxydihydrosanguinarine (Wang et al., 2023), andberberrubine (He et al., 2023), demonstrate significant potential intumor treatment. UkrainTM, a derivative of C. majus alkaloidscomprising components like CHLD, CHE, SNG, protopine, andallocryptopine, induces apoptosis in cells and exerts toxic effects oncancer cells (Habermehl et al., 2006). However, the exact anti-tumormechanisms of C. majus alkaloids remain unclear, necessitating furtherin-depth studies to elucidate their mechanisms of action.Chelidonium majus alkaloids not only exhibit anti-tumor effectsbut also demonstrate significant antimicrobial effects. These alkaloidcomponents are applied to human diseases and also play a role inpreventing and controlling on plant diseases as well. Simultaneously,these alkaloids exert anti-inflammatory effects and treat variousinflammations by regulating the immune system and variousinflammation-related signaling pathways. As research on thepharmacological effects of C. majus alkaloids progresses, there ispotential for further expanding their clinical applications. Analysisof other alkaloids with lower content has revealed that aporphinealkaloids, such as magnoflorine, may reduce blood glucose levels bypromoting insulin release and stimulating insulin activitymechanisms, potentially improving postprandial hyperglycemiaand demonstrating anti-diabetic effects (Patel and Mishra, 2011).Vennerstrom et al. discovered that protoberberine alkaloids showedpotential antimalarial activity in vitro experiments (Vennerstromand Klayman, 1988), while Xiang et al. explored the potential uses ofthese alkaloids in treating stomach diseases and providing gastricprotective effects (Xiang et al., 2024). Berberine has also been notedto prevent and delay AD (Wang et al., 2024), while protopine mayhold a potential role in asthma treatment (Yang et al., 2024).However, studies on these effects are limited and mostly at apreliminary stage. The results of pharmacological activity studiesare mostly based on animal experiments, and the results of clinicalstudies may differ; further research is needed to verify their effectsand mechanisms. Additionally, the synergistic effects between C.majus alkaloids and other drugs or ingredients cannot be overlookedand warrant further exploration.The rich chemical composition and extensive biologicalactivity of C. majus alkaloids provide valuable resources forthe development of pharmaceutical drugs. However, there stillexist limitations in the extraction process, content determination,and the relationship between structure and activity. Futureresearch efforts should focus on optimizing extractionprocesses, improving the purity of bioactive alkaloids, delvinginto the relationship between structure and activity, elucidatingthe underlying mechanisms of action, and facilitating theirpractical application in the field of medicine.7 Conclusions and perspectivesChelidonium majus, a medicinal plant with a long history ofapplication, has been extensively used in European countries as well asin China\u2019s TCM, highlighting its extremely high medicinal value.Alkaloids are the main active components of the plant, which havegarnered attention from many scholars. These alkaloids are abundantin content and variety, but each alkaloid exhibits unique chemicalstructures and can act on multiple biological targets to play atherapeutic role in diseases. This makes C. majus a vast potentialarea for research and development in drug research.To date, researchers both domestically and internationally haveisolated and identified 94 alkaloids from C. majus. This reviewtherefore summarizes the research findings on the phytochemistry,pharmacology, and toxicology of these alkaloids. Additionally, itsystematically classifies these alkaloids according to their structuralproperties, providing a foundational basis for the phytochemicalclassification of C. majus.Through further in-depth study of these alkaloids, morecandidate compounds can be provided for drug research anddevelopment, expanding their potential applications in thepharmaceutical field. However, it is worth noting that thesealkaloids also have some toxicity. Therefore, in the applicationof C. majus for drug development or treatment of diseases, it isnecessary to further explore the toxic mechanisms of thesealkaloids to optimize the extraction process, reduce toxicity,and improve efficacy, thereby laying a solid foundation fortheir broad application in the pharmaceutical field.Simultaneously, strengthening the quality control and safetyevaluation of C. majus is also crucial for future researchdirections, to effectively manage potential risks during drugdevelopment and ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs.In summary, this review provides a basis for understanding thecurrent research status of alkaloid components in C. majus. Asscience and technology advance and research methods improve,more comprehensive studies on C. majus alkaloids are expected,aiming to develop clinically valuable drugs and provide a solidtheoretical framework for the in-depth research and applicationof C. majus.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16Li et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1440979Author contributionsX-LL: Writing\u2013original draft.
