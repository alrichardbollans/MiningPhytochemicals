Thechloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts showed significant antitrypanosomal activity to-wards T. brucei, with IC50 values of 12.35, 13.53 and 12.93 \u00b5g/mL and with IC90 values of 14.94,19.31 and 18.67 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The phytochemical investigation of the fractions led to theisolation and identification of quercetin (1), myricitrin (2), biapigenin (3), myricetin (4), hyperoside(5), myricetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (6) and myricetin-3\u2019-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (7). Myricetin-3\u2019-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (7) has been isolated for the first time from this genus. The chemicalstructures were elucidated by using comprehensive one- and two-dimensional nuclear magneticresonance (1D and 2D NMR) spectroscopic data, as well as high-resolution electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry (HR-ESI\u2013MS). These compounds have also been evaluated for their antiprotozoalactivity. Quercetin (1) and myricetin (4) showed noteworthy activity against T. brucei, with IC50 andIC90 values of 7.52 and 5.71 \u00b5M, and 9.76 and 7.97 \u00b5M, respectively. The T. brucei hexokinase (TbHK1)enzyme was further explored as a potential target of quercetin and myricetin, using molecularmodeling studies. This proposed mechanism assists in the exploration of new candidates for novelantitrypanosomal drugs.Keywords: antitrypanosomal; antileishmanial; hexokinase (TbHK1); docking; flavonoids;Hypericum afrum1. IntroductionTrypanosoma and Leishmania parasites are the etiological agents for the Trypanoso-miasis and leishmaniasis diseases that affect millions of people worldwide [1]. The sand-flyis the vector for Leishmania donovani, which is the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasisin humans, while the tsetse fly transmits trypanosomes of Trypanosoma brucei, which is theMolecules 2021, 26, 1009. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26041009 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2021, 26, 1009 2 of 14causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness.According to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) statistics, there are 12 million peoplecurrently affected by leishmaniasis in 88 countries, and about 350 million people are atrisk. Approximately 500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected annually with theAfrican trypanosome (T. brucei), leading to thousands of deaths [1]. The socio-economicimpact of the morbidity and mortality caused by these protozoan parasites is significant,particularly in tropical and subtropical countries [2,3].In the last few decades, there has been an increased focus on developing treatments forAfrican trypanosomiasis. Although several antitrypanosomal agents from plants have beencharacterized, great efforts are still needed to search for more antiparasitic compounds thathave been evolutionarily derived from nature.The bite of a tsetse fly is responsible for the transmission of T. brucei, which quicklyadapts to the mammalian host and becomes the bloodstream form (BSF). The metabolismof host glucose through glycolysis is essential for the BSF parasite to successfully infectthe host. In BSF parasites, the glycolysis of host glucose provides the sole source of ATPproduction. The transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to glucose in glycolysis iscatalyzed by hexokinases (HK). T. brucei expresses two hexokinase genes encoding T. bruceihexokinase 1 (TbHK1) and 2 (TbHK2), enzymes which are essential for the BSF parasite.The Hypericum genus belonging to the Hypericaceae family has been reported tobe a prolific source of various secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, prenylatedphloroglucinols, naphthodianthrones, and volatile oils, with a wide range of biologicalactivities, such as antidepressant, antiseptic, wound-healing, antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic. Recently, studies on several Hypericum species havereported their antimicrobial activity against a number of bacterial and fungal strains [4\u20136].The present study investigates the antileishmanial activity against L. donovani (pro-mastigotes, axenic amastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in THP1 cells), and the antitry-panosomal activity against T. brucei, of the fractions and isolated compounds of Hypericumafrum Lam. Quercetin (1) and myricetin (4) were discovered to have higher activity againstT. brucei. Further virtual studies were carried out on TbHK1 as a target enzyme for in-vestigating the probable mechanism of quercetin\u2019s and myricetin\u2019s inhibition of parasiticgrowth. Quercetin and myricetin bind to TbHK1 proximal to the active site, and could becytotoxic to the African Trypanosoma parasite as a result of TbHK1 inhibition.2. Results2.1. ChemistryCompounds 1\u20137 were identified as quercetin (1), myricitrin (2), biapigenin (3), myricetin(4), hyperoside (5), myricetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (6) and myricetin-3\u2019-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (7) [7\u201313]. Compound 7 was isolated from the genus hypericum forthe first time. All the compounds were tested in vitro for their antiprotozoal activity. Pen-tamidine was used as a positive control drug in the antileishmanial assays, while DMFO(\u03b1-difluoromethylornithine) was used as the positive control drug in the antitrypanosomalassay, which showed IC50 and IC90 values of 3.634 and 8.804 \u00b5M, respectively.2.2. Antiprotozoal ActivityIn this study, the in vitro antiprotozoal activities were evaluated for the Hypericum afrumaerial parts\u2019 fractions (CHCl3, EtOAc and n-butanol) and isolated pure compounds 1\u20137(Figure 1; see also Supplementary Materials) against T. brucei. The fractions and purecompounds were also tested against L. donovani promastigotes, axenic amastigotes andintracellular amastigotes in THP1 cells, for the determination of general toxicity usingstandard experimental procedures.Molecules 2021, 26, 1009 3 of 14Molecules 2021, 26, 1009 3 of 13 Figure 1. Structure of isolated compounds (1\u20137). None of the fractions or pure compounds showed in vitro antileishmanial activities (Tables 1 and 2). Regarding the antitrypanosomal activity, the chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of H. afrum showed significant inhibitory activity against T. brucei culture, with IC50 values of 12.35, 13.53 and 12.93 and with IC90 values of 14.94, 19.31 and 18.67 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Only compounds 1 and 4 from the ethyl acetate fraction were found to have antitrypanozomal activity. All the samples were simultaneously tested against THP1 cell for the determination of general cytotoxicity. Compounds 1 and 4 showed potent activity against T. brucei at IC50 values of 7.52 and 5.71 and IC90 values of 9.76 and 7.97 \u00b5M, respectively (Table 1). Table 1.

Molecular Modeling StudyIt is worth noting that the bloodstream form of T. brucei is reliant on the glycolyticpathway to generate energy using host glucose as a sole source. Due to the limitedhomology between the host and T. brucei glycolytic enzymes, this makes Hexokinase(TbHK1) a good drug target. Inhibitors of TbHK1 are trypanocidal, with low expectedside effects.A BLAST homology search identified Hexokinase KlHxk1 of the Kluyveromyces lactis(PDB Accession code: 3O08) as the most suitable template. KlHxk1 was crystalized witha high resolution of 2 \u00c5. The target and template share 31% sequence identity and 51%similar amino acids, and only 3% gaps were detected. Using protein family informationfrom PFAM, 14 amino acids were identified as having strictly conserved aligned positionsof the Hexokinase family, with E-values of 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221260, including Thr60, Gly84, Gly92,Arg97, Gly157, Phe158, Phe160, Ser161, Pro163, Leu174, Trp1 7, Lys179, Asp214 andGly217 (Figure 2). Three major pockets were detected by Fpocket, one of which overlapswith the possible sugar binding site (Figure 3). This site was selected for the docking ofthe compounds. Myricetin showed a docking score of \u22128.31 (and IFD score: \u2212743.41),compared to \u22126.62 (IFD score: \u2212735.48) for quercetin. The two compounds occupied thesame pocket with very similar conformation (Figure 4).Quercetin exhibited hydrogen bonds with Ser161, Arg176, Thr178, Thr215 and Glu269,and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with Phe162. The additional hydroxyl group in myricetin did notprovide extra important interaction with the surrounding amino acids. On the otherhand, some of the interactions were lost, which could be attributed to a slight shiftingof the interacting functional groups of myricetin to allow for a proper placement of theadditional hydroxyl group inside the binding site. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulationswere conducted for 50 ns to study the stability and strength of ligand binding. The rootmeans square deviation (RMSD) is used as an indicator for interaction stability.Molecules 2021, 26, 1009 4 of 14Table 1.

It showed an RMSD value of ~3.0 \u00c5 , which is comparable to the 2.4 \u00c5 of the protein back-bone, while quercetin showed a high RMSD value of ~15.0 \u00c5 compared to that of the pro-tein backbone (2.9 \u00c5 ). The binding mode of quercetin required the first 10 ns to adopt the most stable pose in the binding pocket (Figure 5). The reference interaction site model (RISM) solvation approach was used to investigate the location and stability of water mol-ecules (Figures 6 and 7). Figure 3.

Quercetin exhibited hydrogen bonds with Ser161, Arg176, Thr178, Thr215 and Glu269, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with Phe162. The additional hydroxyl group in myricetin did not provide extra important interaction with the surrounding amino acids. On the other hand, some of the interactions were lost, which could be attributed to a slight shifting of the interacting functional groups of myricetin to allow for a proper placement of the ad-ditional hydroxyl group inside the binding site. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for 50 ns to study the stability and strength of ligand binding.

Discussion Flavonoids isolated from different natural resources were reported to exhibit moder-ate to high in vitro antitrypanosomal activity against T. brucei. Our results showed that the chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of H. afrum exhibited potent antitryp-anosomal activity against T. brucei, with IC50 values of 12.35, 13.53 and 12.93 and with IC90 values of 14.94, 19.31 and 18.67 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Quercetin and myricetin were iso-lated from the EtOAc fraction, and showed good activity towards T. brucei, with IC50 val-ues of 7.52 and 5.71, and IC90 values of 9.76 and 7.97 \u00b5M, respectively. A future examina-tion of the chloroform and n-butanol fractions might yield bioactive molecules. Quercetin and structurally related flavonoids possess several biological and pharma-cological activities. Quercetin and myricetin are dietary flavonoids with promising activ-ities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, and others [14,15]. The mechanism of action for quercetin and myricetin as antiparasitics has been postulated as follows: these flavonoids can disrupt the mitochondrial function on the parasites, and most likely inhibit different enzymes, including shock proteins, topoisomerases and ki-nases, among others. They could also show indirect activity through the induction of mi-crobicidal responses, for example, the production of various cytokines and the production of nitric oxide [16]. Hexokinase (TbHK1) enzymes have been shown to be promising tar-gets on T. brucei [17,18]. Quercetin and myricetin were identified as inhibitors of TbHK1, and showed IC50 values of 4.1 and 48.9 \u00b5M, respectively [16]. These results support the idea of considering TbHK1 as a target for antiparasitic activities. These results were fur-ther confirmed by our computational studies. Quercetin has been reported as a potent antileishmanial agent; however, in our study, we did not find it [19]. 4. Material and Methods 4.1.

High-resolution mass spectra ( RMS) were measured onMolecules 2021, 26, 1009 10 of 14a Micromass Q-Tof Micro mass spectrometer with a lock spray source. Column chro-matography was carried out on silica gel (70\u2013230 mesh, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany),C18 SPE (500 mg Bed, Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Diaion HP-20 (Sorbetchtechnologies, Norcross, GA, USA), MN-polyamide-SC-6 (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO,USA) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). TLC (silica gel 60 F254,EmD Millipore Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to monitor the fractions fromcolumn chromatography. Preparative TLC was carried out on silica gel 60 PF254 + 366plates (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm, 1 mm thick). Visualization of the TLC plates was achieved witha UV lamp (\u03bb = 254 and 365 nm) and an anisaldehyde/acid spray reagent (MeOH-aceticacid-anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid, 85:9:1:5). The absolute configurations of the sugar moietiesof all tested flavonoid glycosides have been identified by the UPLC-UV/MS method [20].4.2. Plant MaterialThe aerial parts of Hypericum afrum (Lam.) were collected from the El Kala region,El Tarf, in northeastern Algeria, in July 2011. A voucher specimen (UM-10012014) wasdeposited in the culture collection of the Department of BioMolecular Sciences, Universityof Mississippi.4.3. Extraction and IsolationExtraction and isolation. Dried powdered aerial parts (1000 g) of H. afrum weremacerated at room temperature with EtOH\u2013H2O (80:20, v/v) over 24 h, three times. Thefiltered solvents were combined and evaporated under vacuum at a temperature of 40 \u25e6Cto give a residue (30 g). The obtained extract was suspended in water (800 mL) andsuccessively partitioned with CHCl3, EtOAc and n-butanol, yielding 500 mg (CHCl3), 7g(EtOAc) and 12g (n-butanol) fractions, respectively.The EtOAc fraction (7 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column and eluted witha CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH solvent system of increasing polarity to yield 10 subfractions (E-1\u201310)according to their TLC behavior. The subfraction E-3 (115mg) was further chromatographedon the column of a Sephadex LH-20 with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (1:1) as the eluent yieldingcompound 1 (16 mg) as a yellow precipitate. A yellow precipitate was obtained from thesubfraction E-7 (40% MeOH in CH2Cl2). The solid was combined and subjected to a columnof Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to furnish compound 2 (7 mg). The subfraction E-4 (10% MeOH) (423 mg) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanolto furnish compound 3 (10 mg). Subfraction E-5 (125 mg) was chromatographed on aSephadex LH-20 column with Methanol and further purified by preparative TLC elutedwith CHCl3\u2013MeOH (10:1) to afford compound 4 (15 mg).The n-butanol fraction (12 g) was subjected to column chromatography over DiaionHP-20 to afford three subfractions: A (H2O 100%), B (50% Me0H in water) and C (100%MeOH). Subfraction C (8 g) was subjected to polyamide column chromatography togive 13 subfractions (C-I to C-XIII). Then, 5 g of the subfraction C-X (100% methanol) waschromatographed on MN-polyamide-SC-6 CC (250 g), eluted with water to equilibrate, thenwith gradient\u2013decreased polarities with a water\u2013methanol system to yield 8 subfractions(C-X-1 to C-X-8). Subfraction C-X-4 (50 mg) was further subjected to a column of SephadexLH-20 (20 g) eluted with MeOH-CH2Cl2 (1:1) to afford compound 5 (4.0 mg). C-X-5 (70mg) was subjected to a column of Sephadex LH-20 (30 g) eluted with MeOH-CH2Cl2 (1:1)to afford compounds 6 (5.0 mg) and 7 (10.6 mg).4.4. In Vitro Antileishmanial and Antitrypanosomal AssaysThe in vitro antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal assays were performed on cell cul-tures of L. donovani promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, THP1-amastigotes, and Trypanosomabrucei trypomastigotes, by Alamar Blue assays [21]. The conditions for seeding the THP1cells, the exposure to the test samples and the evaluation of cytotoxicity were the same asdescribed in the parasite rescue and transformation assay [22]. IC50 and IC90 values werecomputed from the dose\u2013response curves using XLfit software. DFMO (difluoromethy-Molecules 2021, 26, 1009 11 of 14lornithine) was used as the positive control. The antiprotozoal activities of the H. afrumfractions and isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro against L. donovani promastig-otes, axenic amastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in THP1 cells. The fractions andsome isolated compounds were also evaluated against T. brucei trypomastigote forms.All the fractions and compounds were simultaneously tested against THP1 cell for thedetermination of general cytotoxicity [22].4.5. Methods: Molecular ModelingThe amino acid sequence of TbHK1 was downloaded from the Uniprot database(www.uniprot.org)(accessed on 1 December 2019). Prime was used to build the 3D modelof the target [23\u201325]. To find the appropriate template, a BLAST homology search wasinitiated with default options. The globally conserved residues were also identified throughthe standard Prime search algorithm. The alignment between the target sequence and thetemplate was calculated to define the complementary secondary structure informationusing the Prime STA option. An all-atom model was constructed using the knowledge-based method. Hydrogen bond assignment and restrained minimization options were usedto fix and relax the generated model. Loop refinement was performed for the model tooptimize the loops\u2019 conformation. Fpocket [26] was then used to detect the ligand bindingsites in the model. We used Glide for the molecular docking step. The receptor grid wasprepared by selecting the amino acids defining the pocket detected by Fpocket. To allowfor more space for the ligands in the binding pocket, scaling of the van der Waals radii by afactor of 0.8 was employed to soften the potential of the nonpolar parts of the receptor. Theprepared ligands were docked using Glide SP docking precision [27\u201331]. The best-dockedpose was saved for each ligand. Then, these poses were used for the molecular dynamicssimulation [32,33], 3D-RISM [34\u201337] and WaterSwap [38,39] steps. The two complexes weresolvated in an orthorhombic box using a TIP4P water solvation model in Desmond SystemBuilder. Appropriate numbers of sodium ions were added to the system to neutralize thenet charge on the protein. The OPLS3 force field was selected for the simulation run. Aftera series of energy minimizations and short simulations, the NPT ensemble was set for theMD production step. Intervals of 25 ps were used to save the coordinates and the MDsimulations were set for 50 ns. The protein\u2013ligand complex was prepared as recommendedfor the 3D-RISM calculation. The grid was defined for the whole protein and the calculationwas performed using the XED force field. We used a grid spacing of 0.3 \u00c5 with a gridexternal width of 14.0 \u00c5. The convergence tolerance was set to 10\u22128 and the total formalcharge was neutralized with counter ions. A WaterSwap calculation was conducted forthe ligands. The normal calculation method was chosen. The charge method was set toGasteiger, and the solvation box buffer dimension was defined as 10.0 \u00c5. The system wasequilibrated for 100 ps using OpenMM.5. ConclusionsThe in vitro antitrypanosomal evaluation of the Hypericum afrum Lam. species againstT. brucei revealed that the CHCl3, EtOAc and BuOH fractions possess potent antitrypanoso-mal activity. Furthermore, the fractionation of these fractions led to the isolation andcharacterization of quercetin and myricetin as the potent components. Quercetin (1) andmyricetin (4) showed good antitrypanosomal activity towards T. brucei, with IC50 and IC90values of 7.52 and 5.71, and 9.76 and 7.97 \u00b5M, respectively.The present study reports for the first time the antiprotozoal properties of the Algerianspecies Hypericum afrum Lam., contributing to the phytochemical and pharmacologicalknowledge of this species. Moreover, this species could be a source of new antitrypanoso-mal agents.The mechanism of antitrypanosomal activity was investigated using molecular dock-ing studies on the potential target enzyme T. brucei Hexokinase (TbHK1). Docking studiesof molecules (1) and (4) revealed their strong affinity towards Hexokinase (TbHK1) as atarget of T. brucei.Molecules 2021, 26, 1009 12 of 14Supplementary Materials: The following are available online, Figure S1: 1H-NMR spectrum ofcompound 1, Figure S2: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 1, Figure S3: Positive HRESIMS ofcompound 1, Figure S4: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 2, Figure S5: 13C-NMR spectrum ofcompound 2, Figure S6: Negative HRESIMS of compound 2, Figure S7: 1H-NMR spectrum ofcompound 3, Figure S8: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 3, Figure S9: Positive HRESIMS ofcompound 3, Figure S10: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 4, Figure S11. 13C-NMR spectrum ofcompound 4, Figure S12: Negative HRESIMS of compound 4.
