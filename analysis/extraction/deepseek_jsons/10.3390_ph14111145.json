The aim of this study was to update a review publishedin 2016 by including the studies that were carried out in the period 2016\u2013July 2021 on about 120Ecuadorian medicinal plants. Relevant data on raw extracts and isolated secondary metabolites wereretrieved from different databases, resulting in 104 references. They included phytochemical andpharmacological studies on several non-volatile compounds, as well as the chemical composition ofessential oils (EOs). The tested biological activities are also reported. The potential of Ecuadorianplants as sources of products for practical applications in different fields, as well the perspectives offuture investigations, are discussed in the last part of the review.Keywords: medicinal plants; Ecuador; traditional uses; phytochemistry; biological/pharmacologicalactivities; ethnobotany1. IntroductionThe geographic location of Ecuador, together with its geological features, makes thecountry\u2019s biodiversity one of the richest in the world. Ecuador is, indeed, consideredamong the 17 megadiverse countries, accounting for about 10% of the entire world plantspecies, and every year new plants are discovered and added to the long list of the speciesalready known. This fact makes Ecuador an invaluable source of potentially new naturalproducts of biological and pharmaceutical interest, such as carnosol, tiliroside [1], anddehydroleucodine (DL) [2]. Moreover, most plants are considered to be medicinal, wherethey are a fundamental part of the health systems of several Ecuadorian ethnic groups [3].The knowledge of traditional healer practitioners has been maintained over hundreds oreven thousands of years [4]. Therefore, herbal remedies have gained acceptance thanks tothe apparent efficacy and safety of plants over the centuries [5]. As a result, several doctors,especially in government intercultural health districts, practice integrated forms of modernand traditional medicine nowadays.Scientific evidence of the therapeutic efficacy and absence of toxicity in Ecuadorianmedicinal plants and their products has started to be collected only in the last few decadesby the researchers of several groups in different Ecuadorian Universities. This scientificactivity has increased dramatically in recent years, thanks to the support of the Ecuadorianpeople and government authorities, who consider the sustainable use of biodiversityresources a possible source of economic wealth.This review gives a comprehensive analysis of recent phytochemical and biologicallyoriented studies that were carried out on Ecuadorian medicinal plants and is focused onthe potential relationships between traditional uses and pharmacological effects, assessingthe therapeutic potential of natural remedies. This review completes the information thatwas provided by our group in 2016 [3]. Since then, more than 100 scientific articles havePharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14111145 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticalsPharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 2 of 41been published concerning phytochemical and pharmacological studies of more than 120plants belonging to 42 different botanical families. In addition, a few naturally derivedproducts have been patented [6]. Moreover, traditional natural preparations, such as Coladamorada, which is consumed on the Day of the Dead (D\u00eda de los Muertos) [7], and Horchatalojana, which is a typical beverage that is made of a mixture of medicinal and aromaticplants consumed by the people of southern Ecuador [8\u201310], have received great attention.Other typical preparations are an infusion of guaviduca from Piper carpunya Ruiz & Pav. [11],which is a traditional drink of the Amazonian people, and the infusion of Ilex guayusa Loes.,which is an emblematic tree of the Amazon Region of Ecuador that is widely used in folkmedicine, ritual ceremonies, and for making industrial beverages [12,13].Many of the scientific articles mentioned in this review refer to studies that werecarried out on plants and traditional preparations from southern Ecuador, especially fromthe province of Loja (Figure 1), which has a long tradition in exporting medicinal plantsof great importance for human health, such as quina (Cinchona spp.) and condurango(Marsdenia condurango Rchb.f.).Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 56 information that was provided by our group in 2016 [3].

Docking studies indicated that cantabricine (1)(Figure 2), which is an alkaloid present in most species underinvestigation, was active on both enzymes. However, thiscompound was not present in the extracts of the two plants thatexhibited the highest in vitro inhibitory activity, namely, P. cuencana(IC50 = 0.88 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5g/mL) against AChE and P. dubia (IC50 = 14.26\u00b1 2.71 \u00b5g/mL) against BuChE; instead, the two species were rich ingalanthamine-type alkaloids [17]. The alkaloid profiles of P. dubiaand P. brevifolia bulbs were investigated and significant inhibitoryactivities on both enzymes were determined [18]. The IC50 values ofthe activity against AChE were 25.48 \u00b1 0.39 and 3.45 \u00b1 0.29 \u00b5g/mL,respectively, whereas the IC50 values against BuChE were 96 \u00b1 4.94and 58.89 \u00b1 0.55 \u00b5g/mL, respectively.

They exhibited high antibacterialactivity, with the pH, soil components, and organic matter asthe main factors that influenced the activity; furthermore, norelationship was found between altitude and the antibacterialeffects. The prediction model that was obtained did not havepredictive ability for different Hypericum species, which couldbe explained by the differences in the chemical compositionsof the three species [57].LamiaceaeClinopodium brownei(Sw.)

Sesquiterpenehydrocarbons (38.50%) and monoterpene hydrocarbons(30.59%) were the most abundant volatiles, whereasoxygenated sesquiterpenes (16.20%) and oxygenatedmonoterpenes (2.10%) were the minor components.Moreover, the most important odorants, from thesensory point of view, were identified using aromaextract dilution analysis (AEDA) GC/O. \u03b1-Pinene,\u03b2-phellandrene, and dauca-5,8-diene exhibitedcharacteristic woody, herbaceous, and earthy odors,respectively. Twelve enantiomeric pairs and twoenantiomerically pure chiral monoterpenoids wererevealed using enantioselective GC analysis of the oil.The enantiomeric excesses varied from a few percentunits to virtually 100% [60].Ursolic acid (8), oleanolic acid (9) (Figure 3), carnosol(30), viridiflorol (31), chrysothol (32), and5-hydroxy-4\u2032,7-dimethoxy flavone (33) (Figure 6) wereidentified in the non-volatile fraction from the leaves ofthe plant. Their structures were determined using X-raydiffraction and NMR and MS techniques [60]. Thechemical compositions of the EOs from the flowers andthe leaves were similar, except for several minorcomponents. The main constituents (>4%) of the flowerEO were \u03b4-3-carene (24.23%), eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol(13.02%), thujopsan-2-\u03b1-ol (11.90%), \u03b2-pinene (7.96%),valerianol (5.19%), and co-eluted limonene and\u03b2-phellandrene (4.47%).

Thediterpene carnosol (30) (Figure 6) exhibited high activityagainst the \u201cblast disease\u201d that is caused by the fungusPyricularia oryzae [61]. The minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)values of carnosol (30) against this fungus were very close tothose of the well-known pesticide flutriafol [61]. Moreover,carnosol (30) showed a promising selective inhibitory activityof the enzyme BuChE (5.15 M, in comparison with8.568 \u00b1 0.570 M of the positive control donepezil) [1].Lepechinia paniculata(Kunth) Epling Yayllon or llanllum in KichwaThe buds are tied at theforehead for treating the\u201cmal de aire\u201d, a sort of evileye, and against headache,while flower infusions areused to treat nervousdiseases.Column chromatographic separation of the leaf EtOAcextract afforded ledol (28), (\u2212)-caryophyllene oxide (29),(\u2212)-carnosol (30), and guaiol (34) (Figure 6) [59]. Inanother work, 40 and 29 compounds were identified inthe EOs that were steam distilled from the leaves andthe flowers, respectively.

The EO and eugenol alsoshowed remarkable activity against Pseudomonas syringae pv.syringae and moderate effects against Candida spp. clinicalisolates, with a possible antimicrobial synergy in associationwith fluconazole. The extracts and isolated compounds wereweakly cytotoxic against a HaCaT cell line (keratinocytes) andnon-mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 andTA100 strains, indicating safety. The EO was weakly activeagainst human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells(A549 cell line). This evidence suggests a potential use of thecrude drug, extracts, and the EO as antioxidant agents incosmetic formulations and food supplements. In addition, theEO may also have potential applications in plant protectionand anti-Candida formulations [65].Salvia leucantha Cav.

Salvia, salvia hoja de flechaTo treat inflammation anddifferent intestinal ailments,fever, influenza, gastritis,cuts, and bumpsThe effects of an ethanolic extract of S. sagittata (SSEE) onprimary cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells (pAECs)were investigated. The cells were cultured in the presence ofdifferent concentrations (1\u2013200 \u00b5g/mL) of SSEE for 24 h, andthe cytotoxicity was evaluated using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.SSEE did not adversely affect the cellular viability at anytested concentration. No significant change was observed inthe cell cycle. The anti-inflammatory effects of SSEE onpAECs were analyzed using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as theinflammatory stimulus. Different markers that were involvedin the inflammatory process, such as cytokines and protectivecompounds, were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCRand Western blots. SSEE showed the ability to restore pAECphysiological conditions by reducing interleukin-6 andincreasing heme oxygenase-1 protein levels. Thephytochemical composition of SSEE was also evaluated viaHPLC/DAD and spectrophotometric assays. The presence ofdifferent phenolic acids and flavonoids was revealed,including rosmarinic acid as the most abundant component.SSEE possessed an interesting antioxidant activity, as assessedusing the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) andDPPH assays. In conclusion, SSEE was suggested to havein vitro anti-inflammatory effects. This finding represents theinitial step toward possible scientific support for thetraditional therapeutic use of the plant [68].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 23 of 41Table 1.

Another study demonstrated thevariability of the chemical composition of the EOisolated from Amazonian O. quixos. Forty-sevencompounds were identified using GC/MS and GC/FID,which represented between 97.17 and 99.89% of the oilcomposition. The constituents were grouped in aliphaticsesquiterpene hydrocarbons (33.03\u201355.89%), oxygenatedmonoterpenes (1.97\u201339.66%), and other compounds(8.94\u201347.83%). The main constituents were (E)-cinnamylacetate (5.96\u201341.65%), (E)-methyl cinnamate(0.38\u201337.91%), and (E)-caryophyllene (8.77\u201337.02%).Statistical analysis suggested the existence of two EOchemotypes and a direct correlation between theenvironmental conditions and the chemical compositionof the oils [70].The EO showed moderate antioxidant activity in the DPPHand the FRAP assays. Concerning the oil antimicrobialactivity, the MICs were 0.5 \u00b5L/L for Staphylococcus aureus,0.05 \u00b5L/L for Bacillus subtilis, 5 \u00b5L/L for Escherichia coli,0.05 \u00b5L/L for Salmonella enteritidis, 0.5 \u00b5L/L for Aspergillusniger, and 0.5 \u00b5L/L for Pennicillium citrinum [69]. In anotherinvestigation, the leaf EO was used to predict the termiticidaland repellent effects on termites Nasutitermes corniger using aone-factor response surface methodology design. Thevariable that was analyzed was the concentration of the EO inEtOH at an interval of 0.05\u20130.3% for the anti-termite activityand between 0.01 and 0.12% for the repellent action. A 100%mortality rate was found at oil concentrations > 0.12%, whilethe effect was 22.2% at the minimum concentration analyzed.Moreover, 100 and 48.9% of the termites were repelled by theoil at concentrations of 0.12 and 0.01%, respectively.Forty-two compounds, 39 of which were identified, weredetected in the leaf EO, which was analyzed using GC/MS.The main compounds were (E)-cinnamyl acetate (36.44%),(E)-cinnamaldehyde (27.03%), (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene (5.21%),and (E)-methyl isoeugenol (4.18%) [71].LecythudaceaeGrias neuberthii J.F.Macbr.

In strikingcontrast, flavonoid glycosides were weakly active againstbacteria. Moreover, the hydroalcoholic extracts and theflavonoids inhibited the activity of \u03b1-glucosidase in adose-dependent manner. Nicotiflorin (40) rutin (41) andgaiadendrin (44) were competitive \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors,while hecpatrin (43) was a non-competitive inhibitor [73].LycopodiaceaeHuperzia brevifolia(Grev. & Hook.)

Mixedwith other plants, somespecies also induce a state oftrance or hallucinations inparticipants inmagical\u2013religious rituals [4].GC/MS analysis of the volatile alkaloidal fractions ledto the identification of a few lycodine-type andlycopodine-type alkaloids (46\u201350) (Figure 8) in H.compacta, H. columnaris, and H. tetragona. The flavonesselgin (51) and tricin (52) (Figure 8) were isolated fromH. brevifolia and H. espinosana, and tricin (52) was alsodetected in the other five species. The rare serratenetriterpenes serratenediol (53), serratenediol-3-O-acetate(54), 21-episerratene-diol (55), and 21-episerratenediol3-O-acetate (56) (Figure 8) were isolated from H. crassa.In addition, the presence of unprecedentedhigh-molecular-weight alkaloids was determined. Ananalytical UHPLC-UV-MS method for the quantificationof tricin (52) in the extracts of Huperzia plants was alsodescribed [74].The significant AChE and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A)inhibitory activity of the alkaloidal fractions from H. brevifolia,H. compacta, H. espinosana, and H. tetragona may support theuse of these plants to prepare brews that induce psychoactiveeffects in participants in magical\u2013religious ceremonies [4].The unusually high amount of tricin (52) in H. brevifolia and H.compacta is remarkable, where this flavone is considered apotent selective inhibitor of different cancer cell lines and apotential colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent [74].MalvaceaeMalva pseudolavateraWebb & Berthel.Malva sylvestris L.Malva (mallow),malva loca, malva alta, malva lisa,or malva mayorMucolyticThe hexane and the 80% hydroalcoholic extracts of theleaves were analyzed using GC/MS.

Thus, the antioxidant ability of ginger EOdemonstrated its potential as a food additive and aphytotherapeutic remedy [103].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 35 of 414. Conclusions and PerspectivesThe criteria for investigating most of the 120 species cited in this review appeared tobe based mainly on an ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological approach. Indeed, scien-tific evidence has often confirmed traditional uses; however, not rarely, tested biologicalactivities were not strictly related to the traditional uses. On the other hand, plants werenot collected with the aim of including extracts or products in high throughput screeningprograms. This strategy should, instead, be involved in future research projects since itis the only investigational system that is available for discovery programs that addressesthe effects of natural products on selected enzymes and receptor targets emanating frommolecular biology.Essential oils (EOs) were the most frequently investigated products. In general, oilcompositions were fully determined using GC/MS and GC/FID analyses; in addition,the oil enantiomer composition and odorant characteristics were often established. Asregards the biological activities of the EOs, the activity of Renealmia thyrsoidea EO against Es-cherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [102], as well as the antifungal activity of Lepechiniaradula [63], Ocimum campechianum [65], Piper ecuadorense [88], and Piper pubinervulum [90]EOs against Candida and Trichophyton strains, which are common causes of severe formsof candidiasis and dermatophytosis, are of great interest. Moreover, it is important tounderline the strong acaricidal activity of a mixture of Bursera graveolens and Schinus molleEOs [44], the repellent effects of Dacryodes peruviana EO against mosquitoes [45], and theanti-termite properties of Ocotea quixos EO [70].Thus, many EOs have the potential to be used not only as components of new perfumesdue to the pleasing organoleptic properties but also as ingredients in the formulations ofphytocosmetics, as well as antiseptic and insect repellent products. Moreover, essential oilsshould be screened in the future against clinically important bacteria and strains that areresistant to common antibiotics.Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia affecting elderly peopleand it is associated with a loss of cholinergic neurons in parts of the brain. Cholinesteraseinhibitors (ChEIs) delay the breakdown of acylcholine that is released into synaptic cleftsand so enhance cholinergic neurotransmission; thanks to these effects, ChEIs are consideredefficacious at treating mild-to-moderate AD. In this context, the study of EO cholinesteraseinhibitory activity is a relatively new area of research; in particular, the oil mechanisms ofaction have been poorly investigated so far. It is, therefore, of great interest that several EOsdescribed in this review exhibited such inhibitory effects; in particular, the highly selectiveBuChE inhibitory activity exhibited by Clinopodium brownei [58], Coreopsis triloba [35],Myrcianthes myrsinoides [77], and Salvia leucantha [66] EOs is worthy of further studies.Equally interesting is the ChEI activity that was found for the flavonoid tiliroside, thediterpene carnosol (30) [1], and the alkaloids found in a few Phaedranassa species [17,18].Concerning the non-volatile fractions and isolated compounds, the studies were lesssystematic and the compounds that are responsible for many plants\u2019 activities are stillunknown. Isolated compounds belonged to different biosynthetic families, including newones, such as the high-molecular-weight alkaloids occurring in some Huperzia species,whose complete structures are, however, still unknown [4]. Extracts and isolated metabo-lites were subjected, almost routinely, to antiradical, e.g., DPPH, ABTS, and antioxidant(e.g., \u03b2-CLAMS and FRAP) assays. These tests are expected and, therefore, of little scientificsignificance for extracts containing phenolic compounds, unless high antioxidant productsmay be developed as phytotherapeutic agents or food supplements with health-promotingactivities through the in vivo reduction of the oxidative stress. In this context, the highantioxidant activities of Baccharis obtusifolia [20], Oreocallis grandiflora [94], and Zingiberofficinale [103] are worthy of note.Oxidative stress induces the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequentinflammation; therefore, the in vitro antioxidant activity of a product is often consideredgood evidence of its anti-inflammatory property. However, a more scientifically soundapproach should require the study of the molecular mechanisms that underline anti-Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 36 of 41inflammatory activities. In this context, the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases(MAPKs) or the release of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2, theinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukins IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, play a majorrole in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders and, thus, serve as significantbiomarkers for the assessment of the inflammatory process. The investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects of Salvia sagittata ethanolic extract [68] is a significant example of suchan approach.Several extracts and isolated compounds that were discussed in this review showedinteresting inhibitory activity of the enzymes \u03b1-glucosidase and/or \u03b1-amylase. Indeed,pancreatic and intestinal glucosidases are the key enzymes of dietary carbohydrate di-gestion, and inhibitors of these enzymes may be effective in slowing glucose absorptionto suppress postprandial hyperglycemia. In this context, it is significant to mention thatthe extracts and phenolic or flavonoid contents of Gaiadendron punctatum [73], Muehlen-beckia tamnifolia [93], Oreocallis grandiflora [19], and Otholobium mexicanum [56], as wellas trans-tiliroside (22) [53], prenyloxy eriodictyol (92), and rhamnetin (101) [96], showedenzymatic inhibitory activity that was comparable or superior to acarbose, which is a drugthat is currently used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, these results shouldpromote studies on determining whether these hypoglycemic products can become sourcesof new antidiabetic drugs.It is very well known that some of the most used drugs in cancer chemotherapyderive from natural products. In this context, the high antiproliferative effects shownby the extracts of some plants, such as Annona montana [15] and Grias neuberthii [72],against several human tumor cell lines are of great interest. Isolated compounds withpotent in vitro cytotoxic properties include the flavonoid tricin (52) from Huperzia spp. [74],the triterpene ursolic acid (11) from Bejaria resinosa [51], and the sesquiterpene lactonesonoseriolide (6) from Hedyosmum racemosus [48] and dehydroleucodine (5) from Gynoxisverrucosa [2]. The antileukemic properties of dehydroleucodine (5) and some derivativeswere the objects of patents [6]. These findings should stimulate more systematic screeningof the cytotoxic effects of Ecuadorian plants\u2019 metabolites and the investigation of themechanisms of the cell antiproliferative effects.Considering the overall research activities that has been carried out so far in Ecuadoron natural products, it can be concluded that little or scarce attention has been dedicatedto the semi-synthesis of derivatives of isolated bioactive compounds with the aims toincrease their activity, to study the structure\u2013bioactivity relationships, and to explorethe mechanisms of action and the signaling pathways that are involved in the biologicalactivities. Even fewer efforts have been put into the synthesis of new chemical entitiesusing computational approaches (in silico) to model the structures of natural products orto design completely new molecules. Indeed, research activities on these themes should beencouraged because they were demonstrated to be highly successful in the discovery ofnew bioactive compounds.Finally, further studies, including those in vivo, are required to understand the rele-vance and selectivity of biological effects that have only been demonstrated in vitro so far.It is also important for practical applications to know potential acute and chronic toxicities,risks, and side effects of the plant-derived products. In fact, even raw extracts can beused as food additives and therapeutic remedies once the absence of toxicity has beendemonstrated, the contents have been standardized, and the efficacy has been scientificallyshown.In conclusion, this review has clearly demonstrated the great potential of Ecuadorianplants as sources of products for different purposes and applications. Moreover, someguidelines for future research programs concerning possible sustainable uses of localtherapeutic resources were indicated.Ultimately, an important purpose of this paper is to stimulate more extensive studieson the rich medicinal flora of Ecuador.Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 37 of 41Author Contributions: Conceptualization, C.A., A.I.S. and J.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,J.R., A.I.S., M.S. and C.A.; literature retrieval, A.I.S., M.S., J.R. and C.A.; review supervision andediting, G.V.
