Across different cultures, theyhave been the basis of traditional medicine practices and theycontinue to be important sources of drugs, especially indeveloping countries that still use herbal medicine as a firstline of healthcare (Salim et al., 2008). Members of theLamiaceae family are considered relevant, due to theirtherapeutic and culinary uses throughout the world(Srancikova et al., 2013).Plectranthus spp. (Lamiaceae) have long been used intraditional medicine, likely due to the many bioactivecompounds found in the genus, having several activities, suchas anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antifungal (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002; Lukhoba et al., 2006; de Albuquerque et al.,2007). These properties suggest Plectranthus as a likely genus ofbioactive compounds suitable for medicinal drug development.The isolation and understanding of the secondary metabolitesfrom Plectranthus species\u2019 responsible for biological activity areimportant, not only to validate the popular common uses of thisgenus, but also to discover novel drug sources with importanteconomic potential, or compounds that can be transformed intoactive ingredients.The genus Plectranthus belongs to the Angiosperms family,Lamiaceae (Nepetoideae subfamily, Ocimeae tribe,Plectranthinae subtribe) and includes about 350 species,distributed mainly in subtropical Africa, Asia, and Australia(Dellar et al., 1996; Narukawa et al., 2001; Gaspar-Marqueset al., 2008). The genus was first described by the Frenchbotanist L\u2019Heritier in 1788 (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and, sincethen, the total number of species belonging to this genus has beenincreasing. Nowadays, Plectranthus spp. are known all over theworld for their horticultural uses as they grow fast, producebeautiful flowers, and are resistant to most plant pests anddiseases. Plectranthus spp. exist as herbs, sub bushes, orshrubs. In Europe, several species of Plectranthus are grown asornamental plants (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002). The potentialmedicinal and economic uses of Plectranthus spp. are of greatinterest. Hidden in this genus are potential treatments for manyconditions. The most frequently cited use of Plectranthus spp. isfor its medicinal properties. They have been used for differentdigestive disorders, skin and respiratory conditions,genitourinary infections, general infections and fever, pain,and musculoskeletal conditions (Narukawa et al., 2001; Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002; Lukhoba et al., 2006). Other applicationsinclude insect repellents, spells, and culinary herbs (Lukhobaet al., 2006; Pal et al., 2011). Themain phytochemical constituentsof the Plectranthus genus are diterpenes, phenolic compounds,and essential oils, the latter giving this genus its natural aroma(Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002; Rice et al., 2011).The species Plectranthus ecklonii Benth. was first collected in1813 by the naturalist William Burchel in the Eastern Cape. It is afast-growing shrub, perennial or annual (1\u20133 m high), with ovateto elliptical leaves, arranged in pairs, and flowers from March toMay, with a peak in April (Van Jaarsveld, 2006). It is easilypropagated using cuttings or seeds and the young plants shouldbe pruned after flowering, or at least before spring. There arethree cultivable species available: the blue-flowered \u201cMedleyWood\u201d, the white-flowered \u201cTommy\u201d, and the pink-flowered\u201cErma\u201d (Figure 1). P. ecklonii is commonly known as Ecklon spurflower or Ecklon spoorsalie and is widely distributed in SouthAfrica, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the United States(Van Jaarsveld, 2006; Nyila et al., 2009).P. ecklonii Benth. is traditionally used in South Africa to treatstomach aches, nausea, vomiting, and meningitis, symptomsusually associated with listeriosis infection (Lukhoba et al.,2006; Chassagne and Morgan, 2020). The leaves are used fortuberculosis-related problems and, in Zimbabwe, aerial parts areapplied for skin diseases and skin hyperpigmentation problems.The activity of P. ecklonii against Escherichia coli justifies the useof Plectranthus spp. in traditional medicine for the treatment ofgastrointestinal infections (Nyila et al., 2009). Similarly, thetraditional use of this plant for skin infections may be relatedto the antibacterial activity of two of its diterpenes, parviflorone D(Salim et al., 2008) and parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013),against Staphylococcus aureus (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).Since the 1960s, the number of papers published on P.ecklonii has been increasing, demonstrating the interest andimportance of investigating this species. In fact, the number ofpublished biological and chemical composition studies on P.ecklonii cited in this paper is 16 times higher in the years from2012 to 2021 compared to that of the previous two decades(Figure 2). Growing intertest, lack of review paper on thisspecies and recent developments in active antitumourcompounds isolated from P. ecklonii justify and warrant acomprehensive up-to-date review. Consequently, the mainaim of this review is to provide and evaluate the first completecompilation of the biological activities exerted by activecompounds isolated, thus far, their mechanisms of actionFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 7682682Ant\u00e3o et al.

The relevance andapplication of secondary metabolites extends further thanjust medicine, including areas of agriculture and industry.Exploration into the different biosynthetic pathways andbiological activities of these metabolites has led to theaccepted categorization of their main, yet broad,categories of plant compounds: 1) terpenes or terpenoids,2) alkaloids, and 3) phenolic compounds (Devappa et al.,2011). Terpenes are undoubtedly the largest, mostdistributed, and, from a structural point of view, the mostdiverse class of secondary metabolites. Their importance,particularly at the therapeutic level, justifies the numerousefforts made over the last few decades to clarify theirbiosynthesis (Devappa et al., 2011).The main phytochemical constituents of the genusPlectranthus are diterpenes, essential oils, and phenoliccompounds (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002). Abietane diterpenoidsof the species Plectranthus are specific antimicrobial andcytotoxic compounds (Teixeira et al., 1997; Gaspar-Marqueset al., 2006). The main compound of the polar extract of P.ecklonii is rosmarinic acid (RA) (Rice et al., 2011), a commonphenolic ester in the Lamiaceae family (Amoah et al., 2016). RA(Rice et al., 2011) together with two other esters of caffeic acid(CA) (Pal et al., 2011), nepetoidine A (Van Jaarsveld, 2006)and nepetoidine B (Nyila et al., 2009), are used aschemotaxonomic markers of the Nepetoideae subfamily(Grayer et al., 2003; Kub\u00ednov\u00e1 et al., 2013). Until now, atotal of 28 compounds have been isolated from P. ecklonii,constituting a variety of different classes of plant compounds.In 1980, Uchida and colleagues were the first to report theisolation and identification of compounds from P. ecklonii(Uchida et al., 1980). At that time, they detected the presenceof the abietane parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013) andecklonoquinones A (\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020) and B (Andradeet al., 2018). After 40 years of research, the composition ofthis species is still not completely clear, however, here wehave enumerated the compounds discovered thus far(Table 1 and Figure 3).TABLE1|(Continued)ThecompoundsisolatedtodatefromP.eckloniiBenth.IsolatedcompoundsIUPACnameandCIDnumberIsolationand/oridentificationmethodsBiologicalActivityaSolventextractor/plantpart(s)Ref.Ladanein(23)scutellarein-5,7,4\u2019-trimethylether(23)[3084066]Salvigenin(24)Scutellarein6,7,4\u2019-trimethylether(24)[161271]AntioxidantGrayeretal.(2010)Cirsimaritin(25)Scutellarein6,7-dimethylether(25)[188323]N/AGrayeretal.(2010)Flavanone2(S)-4\u2019,5-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone(26)2(S)-4\u2019,5-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone(26)[14078484]NMREther/apUchidaetal.(1980)QuinonesEcklonoquinoneA(27)[4,6-dimethyl-7,8-dioxo-1,9-di(propan-2-yl)dibenzo-p-dioxin-2-yl]3-methylbutanoate(27)[21576878]NMRN/AEther/apUchidaetal.(1980)EcklonoquinoneB(28)[4,9-Dimethyl-7,8-dioxo-1,6-di(propan-2-yl)dibenzo-p-dioxin-2-yl]3-methylbutanoate(28)[21576879]N/A,NotApplicable;ap,aerialparts(leaves);wp,thewholeplant.HPLC,Highperformanceliquidchromatography;LC-MS,LiquidChromatography-MassSpectrometry;NMR,NuclearMagneticResonance.a Biologicalactivitypresentedintableisrelatedtothecompound(canbeisolatedfromP.eckloniiandotherspecies)Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 7682686Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiExcept for one study, in which the whole plant (wp) was used(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010), all other studies reported using aerial parts(leaves), possibly to mimic more faithfully the traditional use ofthis plant. Besides, the harvesting of leaves for medicinal purposesis more sustainable than that of other parts of the plant, such asroots and stems, whose excessive harvesting could even threatenthe survival of the plant (Zschocke et al., 2000).DiterpenesDiterpenes, a heterogeneous class of natural compounds based ona skeleton with 20 carbon atoms (C20), are the most commongroup of secondary compounds in the genus Plectranthus,most of which are highly modified abietanoids containingphenolic or quinone rings, in addition to some labdanes, ent-kaurenes, and seco-kaurenes (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002).Regarding the type of hydrocarbon skeleton, diterpenes canbe acyclic or cyclic. Most belong to the cyclic group, and it isprecisely the diversity in the cyclization of the hydrocarbonskeleton, combined with the diversity of functional groupswith oxygen (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, epoxides, quinones,acids, and acid derivatives) which defines their multiplebiological properties (Wang et al., 2002; Rijo et al., 2013).In general, diterpenes are compounds with medium to lowpolarity, although, they often occur in plants in a glycosylatedform, in which case, they are polar substances. Medium polarsolvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate(EtOAc), and acetone are usually used for their extraction,or strong polar solvents, such as methanol, mixtures ofalcohols and water, or even pure water (Waksmundzka-Hajnos and Sherma, 2011).From the ethyl acetate extract of P. ecklonii, two abietanes,parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) and parviflorone F (Srancikovaet al., 2013) have been isolated (Nyila et al., 2009). In 2008, in astudy published by Van Zyl and colleagues, these two abietaneswere also isolated from a DCM extract of P. ecklonii (Van Zylet al., 2008). The detection of parviflorone E (Abdel-Mogib et al.,2002) required a stronger polar solvent, in this case, methanol(Figueiredo et al., 2014). In another study, parviflorone D (Salimet al., 2008) was isolated from an acetonic extract of P. ecklonii,together with the diterpene sugiol (de Albuquerque et al., 2007)and mixtures of ursolic acid (UA) (Lukhoba et al., 2006) witholeanolic acid (OA) (Dellar et al., 1996) and \u00df-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) with stigmasterol (Narukawa et al., 2001)(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010). Meanwhile, the compounds OA (Dellaret al., 1996), \u00df-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008), andstigmasterol (Narukawa et al., 2001) have also been isolated inPlectranthus bishopianus Benth., but from a methanolic extract(Syamasundar et al., 2012).Interest in diterpenoid isolation continues to grow due to itswide range of biological activities (Hanson, 2005). Abietanediterpenoids have attracted interest on account of theirantibacterial (Dellar et al., 1996; Teixeira et al., 1997;Figueiredo et al., 2014), antioxidant (Rijo et al., 2009) andinsect antifeedant activities (Wellsow et al., 2006), as well astheir inhibitory effects on different human cancer cell lines(Marques et al., 2002). Abietane is the skeleton with thehighest occurrence and most widespread in Lamiaceae (VestriAlvarenga et al., 2001). Abietane diterpenoids account for themost common secondary metabolites in Plectranthus.Abietanoids in Plectranthus mostly consist of royleanones,spirocoleons, and quinines (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002). In2007, Van Zyl and colleagues isolated seven abietanediterpenes, including parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) and F(Srancikova et al., 2013), from the leaves of five differentPlectranthus species (van Zyl et al., 2007).TriterpenesTriterpenes and sterols are two groups genetically engineeredfrom the same precursor, squalene. Triterpenes, with themolecular formula C30H48, belong to the terpene group andmay have acyclic carbon skeletons or contain mono-, bi-, tri-,tetra-, and pentacyclic structures (Dewick, 2002; Xu et al., 2004).From a biological point of view, the most important triterpenoidstructures are those with the carbon skeletons of dammarane andeuphane (tetracyclic triterpenes), oleanane, ursane, and lupane(pentacyclic triterpenes) (Dzubak et al., 2006).For a long period of time, triterpenes were disregarded due totheir low hydrophilicity. However, multiple studies, supportingtheir broad range of pharmacological activities and beneficialeffects against several types of human diseases, including cancers,has been emerging (Patlolla and Rao, 2012). The chemistry ofoleanane- and ursane-type triterpenoids have been activelyexplored in recent years, and their biological andpharmacological activities have been found to span a variety ofproperties, namely, antitumor, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory,hepato- and gastroprotective, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, andhaemolytic properties (Sun et al., 2006). These triterpenoidsare relatively non-toxic but their structural similarity tocholesterol gives them low water solubility, a majordisadvantage in terms of bioavailability and, therefore, reducedtherapeutic potential (Soica et al., 2014). However, studies ofstructure activity relationships (SAR) have shown thatmodifications in certain areas of the nuclei of thesecompounds can lead to significantly more active newderivatives (Sun et al., 2006). In Asian countries, thetraditional applications of plants containing OA (Dellar et al.,1996) or UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) in folk medicine are alsomultiple, including for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, sedative,hepatoprotective and cardiotonic effects (Liu, 1995; Poolierand Goossens, 2012). Other studies have also demonstratedtheir antioxidant, antiallergic, antipruritic, and antimicrobialpotential (Jesus et al., 2015). For example, plant-basedmedicines with UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and OA (Dellaret al., 1996) are widely used in the treatment and preventionof type II diabetes mellitus in Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) and Indian medicines (Wang et al., 2013).In the Plectranthus genus, common triterpenes have beenisolated, such as UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) OA (Dellar et al.,1996), betulin, and betulinic acid. Triterpenic acids exhibitimportant biological and pharmacological activities, includinganti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, cytotoxic, andcardiovascular effects (Lin et al., 2002; Odjakova et al., 2012).UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and OA (Dellar et al., 1996) areisomeric triterpenic acids that only differ in the position of theFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 7682687Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniimethyl (CH3) group on C29 and always exist simultaneously inthe same plant (Xu et al., 2004). In 1971, Misra and colleaguesreported the isolation of triterpenes UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006),OA (Dellar et al., 1996) from the methanolic extract of P.bishopianus Benth., which are also found in P. ecklonii (Misraet al., 1971; Andrade et al., 2021).One of the traditional uses of P. ecklonii is for skin ailmentsand, in recent years, collagenase inhibitors, compounds thatprevent the enzymatic degradation of the dermal matrix, havebeen identified in extracts of Plectranthus spp. as OA (Dellar et al.,1996) and UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006). In organic extracts of P.ecklonii, high collagenase inhibition has been reported and,further to this, the isolated compounds, OA (Dellar et al.,1996), and UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006), demonstrated higheranti-elastase activity when compared to the extract. This ismost probably due to the compounds binding to the catalyticsite of the enzyme, justifying its use in dermatology and cosmetics(Andrade et al., 2021). As they share similar structural features,OA (Dellar et al., 1996) and its isomer, UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006),frequently occur simultaneously (Jesus et al., 2015).PhytosterolsPhytosterols or plant sterols are fatty acids contained in plants.Their nutritional interest stems from their structural similarity tocholesterol (Van Jaarsveld, 2006), and their ability to lowerplasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.Unlike sterols, triterpenes do not occur in the animal kingdom(Gabay et al., 2010). In recent decades, phytosterols have receivedmuch attention due to their capability to inhibit intestinalcholesterol absorption, resulting in lower total serumcholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels (Feng et al., 2017).\u03b2-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) and stigmasterol(Narukawa et al., 2001) are the most abundant plant sterolsand occur in complex mixtures. The nutritional interest insterols is due to their similarity in structure to cholesterol(Gabay et al., 2010).Various activities have been attributed to \u03b2-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008), including anti-hyperlipidaemia, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumoral. Some studies suggested that\u03b2-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) could be used as anantibacterial agent and possess the ability to protect the gastricmucosa from acetic acid- or aspirin-induced damage (Liu et al.,2019). In 2017, Feng and colleagues reported less severity ofmucosal colitis in mice treated with \u03b2-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marqueset al., 2008) and stigmasterol (Narukawa et al., 2001) (Feng et al.,2017). \u00df-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) is used as aherbal treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thisapplication is described in the literature in four randomized,placebo-controlled, double-blind studies and included a total of519 men. Three of the studies reported significant benefits in theperception of symptoms and measurable parameters, such asurinary flow rate. In one study, during an 18-months follow-upperiod, the beneficial effects of treatment with \u03b2-sitosterol weremaintained (Berges et al., 2000). However, further clinical trialsare needed to establish the real efficacy and long-term effects of \u00df-sitosterol (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008). Stigmasterol (Narukawaet al., 2001) is used in several chemical processes, which aredesigned to yield numerous synthetic and semi-syntheticcompounds for the pharmaceutical industry. It acts as aprecursor in the synthesis of progesterone and as anintermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens, oestrogens,corticoids, and in the synthesis of vitamin D3 (Sandhar et al.,2011). Although most studies have focused on the cholesterol-lowering activity of stigmasterol (Narukawa et al., 2001), otherbioactivities have been attributed to this plant sterol compound,one of which is a potential anti-inflammatory effect (Gabay et al.,2010). In a more recent study, \u03b2-Sitosterol (Gaspar-Marqueset al., 2008) and stigmasterol (Narukawa et al., 2001) did notdemonstrate anti-inflammatory responses through the NOscavenging pathways, however, further studies on the responsethrough other mechanisms, such as COX-2, should be explored toidentify the mediators responsible for the anti-inflammatoryeffect (Andrade et al., 2018). Parviflorone D (Salim et al.,2008) in mixtures of plant sterols, such as \u03b2-sitosterol(Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) and stigmasta-5,22(E)-dien-3\u00df-ol (Narukawa et al., 2001), have been isolated from P. ecklonii(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).PhenolicsPhenolic compounds are important plant secondary metabolitesthat play a key role in disease-resistance, pest protection, andspecies dissemination. They are widespread constituents of plantfoods (fruits, vegetables, cereals, chocolate, etc.) and beverages(tea, coffee, beer, wine, etc.). There are ten main classes ofphenolic compounds, which includes phenolic acids,flavonoids, and tannins, and are generally involved in thedefence against ultraviolet (UV) radiation or aggression bypathogens, parasites, and predators, as well as contributing toplants\u2019 colours (Dai and Mumper, 2010). Flavonoids andphenolic acids (mainly hydroxycinnamic acids) are the mostabundant compounds found in plant extracts (Ramu et al.,2012). The biological effects of hydroxycinnamic acids inhumans are mainly related to their antioxidant function,although many other bioactivities have been reported for thesecompounds, such as antidiabetic, antigenotoxic andantimicrobial activities (Vinholes et al., 2015). However, anddespite their abundance in diet and credible effects on theprevention of various OS-related diseases, only recently havedietary polyphenols been truly recognised by nutritionists,researchers and food manufacturers. Their preventive effects,in terms of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, andcancer, have been deduced from epidemiologic data (in vitroand in vivo) and result in nutritional recommendation (Dai andMumper, 2010). The most recently identified property ofpolyphenols is their effect on long-term diabetescomplications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, andneuropathy (Bahadoran et al., 2013).The main phenolic compounds identified in the extracts ofSalvia and Plectranthus are the hydroxycinnamic acids and theirderivatives, such as rosmarinic (Rice et al., 2011), chlorogenic(Chassagne and Morgan, 2020), carnosic, and salvianolic acids.Among the most abundant cinnamic acids is caffeic acid (CA)(3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) (Pal et al., 2011), described ashaving a wide variety of biological activities, includingFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 7682688Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiantioxidant, antithrombotic, antihypertensive, antifibrotic,antiviral, and antitumour properties (Rajendra Prasad et al.,2011). While the isolation of hydroxycinnamic acids is mostlydescribed in the literature in aqueous extracts, in the case of P.ecklonii there have been attempts by scientists to test otherextracts, specifically hydroalcoholic extracts. Despite traditionalpreparations of plant extracts using water (e.g., infusions,decoctions, and poultices) (Rabe and Van Staden, 1997), thereare reports of studies in which methanolic extracts have shown ahigher content of phenolic compounds when compared toaqueous ones (Krishnaiah et al., 2011). RA (Rice et al., 2011)is an ester of CA (Pal et al., 2011) with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lacticacid (Petersen, 2013), the major component of polar extractsfrom many plants of the Lamiaceae family (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009) and,presumably, one of the main compounds responsible for thepotent antioxidant activity of Lamiaceae plants (Ozgen et al.,2008). Besides its well-studied antioxidant activity, RA acts as anenzyme inhibitor. It is known to interfere with gene expressionand signalling pathways related to cancer prevention and presentsantiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties (Bhattet al., 2013). In 2010, Figueiredo and colleagues pointed out thepresence of RA (Rice et al., 2011) in the aqueous extract of P.ecklonii as responsible for the antibacterial activity againstStreptococcus spp. and for the inhibition of the enzymeglycosyltransferase (GTF) (Figueiredo et al., 2010).Furthermore, in 2009, Fal\u00e9 and colleagues also linked thepresence of this compound to the observed effects of AChEinhibition and antioxidant activity (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009). Besidesits well-studied antioxidant activity, RA (Rice et al., 2011) acts asan enzyme inhibitor. It is known to interfere with gene expressionand signalling pathways related to cancer prevention and presentsantiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties (Bhattet al., 2013). Whereas CA (Pal et al., 2011) and its derivatives arewidespread in the Labiatae family, RA (Rice et al., 2011) is restrictedto the Nepetoideae subfamily (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002). For thisreason, RA (Rice et al., 2011) and two other esters of CA (Pal et al.,2011), known as nepetoidin A (Van Jaarsveld, 2006) and nepetoidinB (Nyila et al., 2009) are used as chemotaxonomic markers for thesubfamily Nepetoideae (Grayer et al., 2003).FlavonoidsFlavonoids are low molecular weight aromatic compoundscharacterized by a flavanic nucleus and a carbon skeleton witha C6-C3-C6 configuration. Flavonoids contain a skeleton madeup of fifteen-carbon atoms, consisting of two benzene rings,joined by a heterocyclic pyrane ring (Kumar and Pandey,2013). The individual numbering of the flavonoid skeleton isshown in Figure 4 (Martens and Mith\u00f6fer, 2005). Flavonoids arewell-known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, andcytoprotective activities. Most importantly, they appear in allgreen plants and constitute a large part of our common dailydiet, making them vital components in the prevention of humandiseases (Schmidt et al., 2012). Variations in the C ring replacementconfigurations result in the various subclasses of flavonoids:flavones (e.g., apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) and luteolin(Grayer et al., 2003)), flavanones, isoflavones, flavonols,flavanols (or catechins), and anthocyanidins (Sandhar et al., 2011).Research reports flavonoids as having many activities (anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, cytotoxic, antitumour, effects on theFIGURE 3 | (A) Chemical structures of terpenes and sterols isolatedfrom P. ecklonii. (B) Chemical structures of phenolic compounds andquinones isolated from P. ecklonii.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 7682689Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniitreatment of neurodegenerative diseases), but the best-describedcharacteristic of the majority of flavonoids is their ability tobehave as antioxidants scavenging free radicals and/orchelating metal ions. They are also known to inhibit lipidperoxidation, platelet aggregation, and enzyme activity of COXand LOX enzymes (Asif and Khodadadi, 2013). Flavonoidslacking hydroxyl groups on their B-rings are more activeagainst microorganisms than are those with the -OH groups(Cowan, 1999). Flavones differ from flavanones by the presenceof a double bond between C2 and C3 in the heterocyclic flavonoidskeleton. The B ring is connected to C2 and there are usually noC3 substitutes. Flavones occur mainly as 7-O-glucosides,although substitution can be found in any other hydroxylatedposition (Martens and Mith\u00f6fer, 2005).A study with the hydroalcoholic extract of P. ecklonii leafextract showed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity andresulted in the identification of the flavones: vitexin (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006), isovitexin (Amoah et al., 2016), apigenin 7-O-\u03b2-glucoside (Devappa et al., 2011), apigenin 4\u2019,6-dimethoxy-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside (Teixeira et al., 1997), luteolin 7-O-glucoside(Kub\u00ednov\u00e1 et al., 2013), apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) andluteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) (Hawas et al., 2008). Since then,the flavones cirsimaritin (Nyila et al., 2012), ladanein (Gurlal,2005), and salvigenin (Van Zyl et al., 2008) have been isolatedfrom P. ecklonii (Grayer et al., 2010). Apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al.,2010) and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) are frequently found inseveral plant species. Apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) (4\u2019,5,7-trihydroxyiflavone) has gained particular interest in recentyears as a beneficial and health promoting agent due to its lowintrinsic toxicity. Plants rich in luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003)(3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) have been used in TCM fortreating various diseases such as hypertension, inflammatorydisorders and cancer (Lin et al., 2008). Vitexin (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006) and isovitexin (Amoah et al., 2016),naturally occurring C-glycosylated derivatives of apigenin(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010), have been known to possess potent anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease (anti-AD), and anti-inflammatory activities (Choi and Lee, 2009). Plant extractscontaining vitexin (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006) (apigenin-8-C-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) are reported to possess anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities (Borghi et al., 2013).Phytochemical studies that have been reported investigating P.ecklonii also include the isolation of two isomeric ortho-quinones,ecklonoquinones A (\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020) and B (Andrade et al.,2018) (Uchida et al., 1980), twelve flavones (Hawas et al., 2008), aswell as salvigenin (Van Zyl et al., 2008), cirsimiratin (Nyila et al.,2012) and the corresponding flavanone, 2(S)-4\u2019,5-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (Costa et al., 2018) (Uchida et al., 1980;Grayer et al., 2003). Flavonoids with a 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-type substitution in the A-ring, such as salvigenin (Van Zyl et al.,2008), cirsimaritin (Nyila et al., 2012) and cirsiliol (Uchida et al.,1980) flavones, are considered typical in the Labiateae family(Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006). No reference to any bioactivitiesexercised by ecklonoquinones A (\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020) and B(Andrade et al., 2018) has been found in the literature andtherefore they are not discussed in this review.In the following section, some of the biological activities attributedto the different constituents of P. ecklonii will be evaluated anddiscussed (Figure 5), to try to understand not only its traditionalapplications, but also the future implications for this plant.BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF ISOLATEDCOMPOUNDS FROM P. ECKLONII BENTHAntibacterialThe most studied bioactivity in P. ecklonii isolated compoundswas antimicrobial, such that, different types of microorganismshave been tested. The compounds showed varying degrees ofactivity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria(Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli), and fungi, such asAspergillus niger and Candida albicans. In general, thecompounds exert greater antibacterial activity on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Listeria, andStreptococcus).Parviflorones are natural diterpenes widely distributed amongseveral Plectranthus species (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).The pigmentsparviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) and parviflorone F (Srancikovaet al., 2013) were isolated for the first time from an ethereal extractof Plectranthus parviflorus (R\u00fcedi and Eugster, 1978). Since then,parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) [2\u03b1-(4-hydroxy)benzoyloxy-11-hydroxy-5,7,9(11),13-abietatetraen-12-one], has been isolatedfrom P. strigosus Benth. (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2008) and P.eckloniiBenth. and reported antibacterial activity, including againstmethicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).Parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013) [11-hydroxy-2\u03b1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyloxy)-abieta5,7,9(11),13-tetraene-12-one] wasalso isolated from P. ecklonii and Plectranthus nummulariusBriq. (Narukawa et al., 2001), as well as parviflorone E (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002) [11-hydroxy-19-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoiloxy)-abieta-5,7,9(11),13-tetraene-12-one] (Figueiredo et al., 2014).The leaves of members of the Lamiaceae family are known tocontain terpenoids with antifungal, antibacterial, and insectrepellent activities (Cole, 1994). Extracts obtained from theleaves of some Plectranthus species in South Africa haveshown antibacterial activity (Rabe and Van Staden, 1997).Abietane diterpenes isolated from Plectranthus elegansinhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis(Dellar et al., 1996). The diterpenes isolated from Plectranthusgrandidentatus and Plectranthus hereroensis also proved to beactive against resistant Gram-positive bacteria, EnterococcusFIGURE 4 | The double bond between C2 and C3 makes it possible todistinguish flavones from flavanones.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826810Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniifaecalis vancomycin-resistant (VRE) and Methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Gibbons, 2004; Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006). Concerning ethyl acetate extracts of P.ecklonii, two known abietanes, parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008)and parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013), were isolated andboth compounds demonstrated effective activity against Listeriamonocytogenes (Nyila et al., 2009). The traditional use of P.ecklonii for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders mayalso be related to its activity against E. coli (Nyila et al., 2012),although further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.Abietanes parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) and F(Srancikova et al., 2013) were also active againstMycobacterium smegmatis, P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis (Nyilaet al., 2009). The antibacterial activity of sugiol (de Albuquerqueet al., 2007) was also tested, although authors reported very lowactivity against Gram-positive E. faecalis bacteria (Sim\u00f5es et al.,2010). The leaves of the plant are used for respiratory symptoms,chest pain, and coughing (problems related to tuberculosis),which may be due to the inhibitory growth activity of M.tuberculosis presented by parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008)and F (Srancikova et al., 2013) (Nyila et al., 2009). Parviflorone D(Salim et al., 2008) has also inhibited the growth of S. aureus(Nyila et al., 2009; Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010), which possibly justifies theuse of the aerial parts of the plant in Zimbabwe for skin diseasesand hyperpigmentation problems (Lukhoba et al., 2006).Antibacterial activity of parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) hasbeen reported against Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species,including against MRSA and VRE strains (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).Even the rearranged abietane 2\u00df-(4-hydroxy)benzoyloxy(Figure 6) obtained in 2010 by Sim\u00f5es and colleagues fromparviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) showed antibacterialactivity against some Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strainswhen tested against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).According to Cowan, the mechanism responsible for theantibacterial activity of diterpenes may be associated with thebreakdown of the bacterial membrane by lipophilic compounds(Cowan, 1999).FIGURE 5 | Summary diagram of biological activities demonstrated by each family of compounds.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826811Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiThe high cost of synthetic drugs and the problem of multidrugresistance has increased the need to exploit the anti-Listeriapotential of medicinal plants. Plant extracts are affordable andaccessible, which has led to the use of medicinal plants as analternative in the treatment of listeriosis. P. ecklonii Benth. is oneof the plants traditionally used to treat the symptoms associatedwith listeriosis infection (Lukhoba et al., 2006). Many organisms,including the opportunistic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes,appear more often as biofilms, such as in healthcare-acquired\u201chospital\u201d infections. An ethyl acetate extract from P. eckloniishowed anti-Listeria activity with a minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) of 0.5 mg/ml. Parviflorone D (Salimet al., 2008) and F (Srancikova et al., 2013) showed evenhigher activity in the breakdown of L. monocytogenes biofilmwith a MIC of 15.6 \u03bcg/ml and 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Table 2)(Nyila, 2010). Although the results illustrate a possible use of thecompounds as disinfection agents, further studies should becarried out to investigate their potential for effectivelyremoving Listeria biofilm from contaminated surfaces.Different reports have shown that UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) andOA (Dellar et al., 1996) exhibit antimycotic, antitumoral,antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic properties. UA (Lukhobaet al., 2006) and OA (Dellar et al., 1996) present remarkableantimicrobial activities and they act against important humanpathogens, such as mycobacteria, HIV, and different protozoalspecies (Jesus et al., 2015). UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and itsderivatives have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity, forexample, as inhibitors of Gram-positive S. aureus, Gram-negativeorganisms (P. aeruginosa and E. coli), and Microsporium lenosum(Zaletova et al., 1986). OA (Dellar et al., 1996) showed antimicrobialactivity against Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus(MSSA), and MRSA (Sun et al., 2006). When used against M.tuberculosis, both OA (Dellar et al., 1996) and UA (Lukhobaet al., 2006) presented anti-tuberculosis potential (Jim\u00e9nez-Arellanes et al., 2007). In 2010, Figueiredo and colleagues pointedout that the presence of RA (Rice et al., 2011) in the aqueous extract ofP. ecklonii is responsible for the antibacterial activity againstStreptococcus spp. (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009).AnticariogenicDental caries has been the oral pathology most responsible for theloss of tooth structure with Streptococcus mutans being consideredthe main cause of this dental disease. Despite the diversity ofhuman oral flora composition, two Streptococci strains,Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, have beenimplicated as the primary etiologic agents of dental caries(Hamada and Slade, 1980; Song et al., 2006; Bernardes et al.,2010). One of the most important virulence factors of these speciesis their ability to produce glucosyltransferases (GTFs) and multipleglucan-binding proteins (Gbp proteins), which are thought topromote adhesion of bacteria to the tooth surface, contributingto the formation of dental plaque (Song et al., 2006; Matsumoto-Nakano, 2018). For biofilm formation, S. sobrinus and S. mutansmust have the ability to adhere to a surface. Therefore, ifcompounds make such adherence impossible, both the biofilmformation process and its subsistence will be compromised.The aqueous extract of P. ecklonii has been reported to haveantibacterial activity against S. mutans and S. sobrinus andinhibited the enzyme GTF. The main compound present in P.ecklonii said to be responsible for this action is RA (Rice et al.,2011), however, the authors have noted that the inhibitoryeffect of the acid on biofilm formation did not differsignificantly from the effect observed for the aqueousextract (Figueiredo et al., 2010). The methanol extractfrom P. ecklonii leaves revealed the presence ofparviflorone E (Narukawa et al., 2001), together with RA(Rice et al., 2011), resulted in higher anti-cariogenic activity(Figueiredo et al., 2014), confirming this species importancein the prevention of oral diseases. Furthermore, theantimicrobial activity of an aqueous extract of P. ecklonii,containing RA (Rice et al., 2011), showed the extract as beingactive in bacteria, particularly against Gram-positive S.epidermidis, normally found in skin flora, justifying itstraditional use and demonstrating its potential for skinapplication (Nicolai et al., 2020). By contrast, in anin vitro study of the antimicrobial activity ofhydroalcoholic extracts (EtOH/H2O) of Rosmarinusofficinalis against S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S.mitis, S. sanguinis, and E. faecalis, neither RA (Rice et al.,2011) nor the two ester derivatives prepared from it showedantimicrobial activity against the selected microorganisms(Bernardes et al., 2010). Further studies should therefore becarried out to confirm the true action of the compound (Riceet al., 2011) against the species Streptococcus concerned.AntiviralAmong the various important pharmacological propertiesattributed to OA (Dellar et al., 1996) is its hepatoprotectiveFIGURE 6 | PRISMA flow chart demonstrating the selection process andcriteria.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826812Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniieffect. It has been shown that OA (Dellar et al., 1996) is not onlyeffective in protecting the liver from acute chemically inducedliver injury but also protects the liver from fibrosis and cirrhosiscaused by chronic liver diseases (Poolier and Goossens, 2012).OA (Dellar et al., 1996) has been marketed in China as a humanover-the-counter (OTC) drug for the treatment of liver diseasessuch as acute and chronic hepatitis and a recent report shows thatan extract, containing both acids (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and(Dellar et al., 1996), has significantly suppressed the replication ofthe hepatitis C virus (Kong et al., 2013). Given the anti-viralpotential of these compounds, the authors propose the inclusionof these two compounds in clinical trials as monotherapy orcombination with other hepatitis C antivirals. Furthermore,considering the extensive antiviral activites shown by P.ecklonii, it could be interesting to further investigate the effectof its active compounds for the treatment of other common viralinfections, such as, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (caused by the coxsackievirus virus).AntiplasmodicMalaria is currently one of the world\u2019s public health concerns dueto factors such as resistance to chemotherapy, poor hygieneconditions, poorly managed vector control programs, and lackof approved vaccines. There has been a general call for the use ofnatural products (NPs) as medicines or as a basis for thedevelopment of new antimalarials, to avoid the problemsrelated to drug resistance (Amoa Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2013). Of thefour types of parasite associated with human malaria,Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most severecases and is therefore used in most studies assessingcompound activity in these species (Bero et al., 2009).The antimalarial properties of Plectranthus species weredetermined by Van Zyl and colleagues in 2008; seven abietanediterpenes, including parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008), F(Srancikova et al., 2013), and E (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002),were isolated and their antiplasmodial activity and ability toinhibit the formation of \u03b2-haematin were tested (Van Zylet al., 2008). Parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008) and F(Srancikova et al., 2013) were isolated from P. ecklonii leavesand exhibited antiplasmodial activity (van Zyl et al., 2007). Thelipophilic nature of abietane diterpenes allows them to easilycross erythrocyte and parasitic membranes to accumulate in theparasite vacuole. It is believed that the inhibitory effect of thesecompounds is related to their ability to inhibit the formation of\u03b2-haematin. This is an important effect since the malaria parasitedegrades haemoglobin and the released haem, which is toxic tothe parasite, is normally converted to the inert malaria pigment,\u03b2-haematin. Parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013) was moreeffective than quinine and 62% as active as chloroquine, twoconventional antimalarials. Parviflorone E (Abdel-Mogib et al.,2002), isolated from P. purpuratus (subspecies tongaensis)(compound also existing in P. ecklonii), has also been shownto bemore active than quinine.When combined with quinine, thecompounds Parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013) and E (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002) interacted in an additive manner (Van Zylet al., 2008). With (Srancikova et al., 2013) and (Abdel-Mogibet al., 2002) showing higher efficacy than quinine in treatingmalaria, and the fact that P. ecklonii grows in Africa where otherparasitic diseases exist, studies on other parasitic diseases shouldbe performed, for example, sleeping sickness produced byTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma bruceigambiense. Furthermore, it would be appropriate to suggestinvestigation of these compounds on other diseases alsotreated by quinine. Most diterpenes are known to combinehigh antiprotozoal activity with high toxicity to mammaliancells (e.g., kidney epithelial cells), hepatoma cells, and coloncarcinoma cells. The cytotoxic profile of these compoundsindicated a low degree of specificity towards the malariaparasite, making them weak candidates for the developmentof antimalarial agents. However, the authors suggested thatfurther chemical modifications of these naturally-derivedcompounds and analogues of Parviflorone F (Srancikovaet al., 2013) could result in more active antiprotozoal agentswith decreased toxicity (Van Zyl et al., 2008). According toBero and colleagues, the diterpene sugiol (de Albuquerqueet al., 2007) is also a promising antimalarial agent with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) between 1.4 and3.4 \u03bcM, determined in vitro on P. falciparum strains (BeroTABLE 2 | MICs and IC50 values of the compounds Parviflorone D, Parviflorone F and Sugiol against different tested microorganisms.Microorganism Parviflorone D Salim et al.(2008)Parviflorone F Srancikovaet al.

Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiet al., 2009). Combinations of compounds (Srancikova et al.,2013), (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002) and (de Albuquerque et al.,2007), should be carried out in specific formulations to identifyany additive properties.Several studies have demonstrated a growth inhibitory effect offlavonoids, in particular flavonol quercetin and flavone luteolin(Grayer et al., 2003), in protozoa of the genera Toxoplasma,Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Most studies involve malaria andflavonoids isolated by biologic studies of species used in traditionalmedicine (Lehane and Saliba, 2008). The in vitro antiplasmodialactivity of eleven flavonoids, including the flavones apigenin (Sim\u00f5eset al., 2010) and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003), has been tested against achloroquine sensitive strain (3D7) and a chloroquine resistant strain(7G8) of P. falciparum. The most active compound against bothstrains was luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003), with IC50 values of 11 \u00b11 \u03bcM and 12 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M for the 3D7 and 7G8 strains, respectively. Itwas also found that luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) prevents theparasite\u2019s growth progression beyond the trophotozoic phaseand does not affect the parasite\u2019s susceptibility tochloroquine or artemisinin antimalarial drugs. Thecombination of low concentrations of different flavonoidsappears to produce an additive antiplasmodic effect(Lehane and Saliba, 2008). When isolated from P. strigosus,the flavone salvigenin (Van Zyl et al., 2008) showed lowactivity against P. aeruginosa (Gaspar-Marques et al.,2006). It also proved to be a very weak inhibitor of S.aureus, as opposed to apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010), whichwas active in MSSA and MRSA-type strains (MIC 3,9\u201315,6 \u00b5g/ml) (Sato et al., 2000).Acids (Lukhoba et al., 2006) and (Dellar et al., 1996) have alsobeen described as potent agents against Leishmania species. Thesetriterpenic acids are active against amastigotes (IC50 7\u2013120 nM) anddisplay moderate activity in the promastigotes (IC50 51-137 nM) ofLeishmania donovani and L. major (Tan et al., 2002). To establishanti-Leishmania SAR, in 2011, Peixoto and colleagues prepared OA(Dellar et al., 1996) derivatives and compared their IC50 values(Peixoto et al., 2011). The results of this in vitro study suggestedthat an increase in lipophilicity in the carbon 17 (C17) is morerelevant to anti-Leishmania activity than an increase in lipophilicityin C3.Anti-fungicidalDichloromethane extracts of P. ecklonii were screened forantibacterial and antifungal activities using the agar well andtrench diffusion methods. Although both methods producedinconsistent results, high biological activity was observed whenP. ecklonii was tested against Candida species by the trenchdiffusion technique (Gurlal, 2005). Abietane diterpenesisolated from Plectranthus elegans inhibited spore germinationof the fungus Cladosporium cucumerinum (Dellar et al., 1996).Anti-fungicidal activity of the rearranged abietane 2\u00df-(4-hydroxy)benzoyloxy (Figure 7), obtained by Sim\u00f5es andcolleagues in 2010, from parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008),showed promising results against C. albicans (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010).The flavone salvigenin (Van Zyl et al., 2008), isolated from P.strigosus, showed low activity against C. albicans (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006). Antifungal activity against Aspergillusniger has also been reported for the compounds nepetoidin A(Van Jaarsveld, 2006) and nepetoidin B (Nyila et al., 2009)(Grayer et al., 2003). Nepetoidin B has also shown activityagainst Cladosporium herbarum. (Figueiredo et al., 2010).AntitumourAbietane diterpenes display an array of biological activitiesincluding cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities againsthuman tumour cells (Burmistrova et al., 2013). Abietanediterpenes, especially those containing quinone moieties,deserve greater attention because several cancerchemotherapeutic agents also possess the quinone structuralfeature (Fronza et al., 2012). Biological membranes arepotential targets of abietane diterpenes due to their lipophiliccharacter. Studies show that cell death induced by thesecompounds may not follow a single mechanism, but ratherseveral ones. It is also possible that the structural properties ofditerpenes can influence or determine their molecular mode ofcell death (Spiridonov et al., 2003; Fronza et al., 2012).Sugiol (de Albuquerque et al., 2007) was reported to exhibitmodest growth inhibitory activity against human breast, lung,and colon cancer cell lines (Son et al., 2005). In a study involvinghuman pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2, sugiol (deAlbuquerque et al., 2007) influenced the relaxation activity ofhuman DNA topoisomerases I and II. This compound showedpreferential inhibition of topoisomerase I (IC50 of 2.8 \u00b5M) anddemonstrated lower IC50 values than camptothecin, a classicaltopoisomerase I inhibitor (28.0 \u00b5M) (Fronza et al., 2012).Recently, the anticancer effect of parviflorone D (Salim et al.,2008) was also evaluated in human breast cancer cells (Costaet al., 2018) and the results indicated further studies should bedone towards a potentially therapeutic application. Furthermore,since parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) demonstrates limitedwater solubility, the formulation of parviflorone D (Salim et al.,2008) into hybrid nanoparticles to assist in longer-term drugdelivery and therapeutic effect has been documented. It wasreported that parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) showedcytotoxic activity towards human melanoma cells (A375),human \u2018normal-like\u2019 fibroblasts (Detroit 551 cell line), andmouse cell lines (B16V5). Further to this, \u03b1-MSH-conjugatedhyaluronic and oleic acid-coated nanoparticles were formulatedand showed promising results as long-term drug-releaseplatforms in the targeted and localized therapeutic actiontowards melanoma cell lines (Silva et al., 2016). Additionally,studies investigating the use of optimized nanosystems forparviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) delivery to pancreatictumour cells, using erlotinib nanoparticles conjugated toparviflorone D (1) loaded albumin nanoparticles showedpromising delivery to the tumour site and highantiproliferative effect in BxPC3 cell lines (Santos-Rebelo et al.,2018; Santos-Rebelo et al., 2019). During a study into the in vitroanti-inflammatory activity of Plectranthus NPs, parviflorone D(Salim et al., 2008), along with royleanone isolated from P.grandidentatus, demonstrated cytotoxic activity two timesgreater than the compound with the lowest viability. Thiscytotoxic evaluation showed parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008)as having high toxicity for RAW 264.7 cells (Andrade et al., 2018).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826814Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiParviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) isolated from P. eckloniishowed cytotoxicity against human leukaemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549, by inducingapoptosis and influencing ROS levels (\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020). Inanother recent study, parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) inducedapoptosis in a human H7PX glioma cell line, obtained from braintumour glioblastoma multiforme cells and demonstrated thehighest amount of cytotoxicity against CCRF-CEM and A459cell lines, when compared to other royleanone abietanediterpenes. Parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) produced 73%of early and late apoptosis when compared to untreated cells. Theauthors suggest that the high levels of phosphorylated histone inthe H7PX cell lines, indicative of double-strand breaks, a decreasein the mitochondrial membrane potential and a change in proand anti-apoptotic gene expression all contributed to apoptosis(\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020). Furthermore, a study into the in vitrobioactivity of parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) highlighted thedifferent pathways involved in the cytotoxic activity of thecompound against multiple human cancer cell lines, includingHL-60, U-937, MOLT-3, and K-562. The apoptosis induced byparviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) was also attributed to thereduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential andinfluencing the levels of ROS. However, also, the inhibition ofextracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) enhanced tumorouscell death (Burmistrova et al., 2015). These results, along withthose previously listed indicate parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008)as having huge potential as a chemotherapeutic drug. Proteinkinases C (PKC), which are involved in a variety of carcinogenicprocesses, have become a popular target for cancer therapy overthe years. By using molecular docking studies, it has been possibleto predict the enhanced activity of derivatized royleanones incancer cell lines. Parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) showedactivity against aggressive breast cancer cells, such as SUM159sphere stem cells, as well as inhibiting MCF-7, SkBr3, andSUM159 cell lines, but also demonstrated a large interactionprofile when binding sites were substituted with differentmoieties. Parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) PKC isoformsdemonstrated the highest interaction profile when comparedto other diterpene isoforms studied (Isca et al., 2020). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a rare and more aggressivecancer, in which the tests for estrogen receptors,progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein comeback negative, has been studied with parviflorone D(Salim et al., 2008) to assess the therapeutic action of(Salim et al., 2008) in a model of TNBP, MDA-MB-231cell lines. Overall, it was reported that (Salim et al., 2008)reduced the cell mobility and chemotactic invasion andinduced apoptosis, once again demonstrating the potentialof Parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) in chemotherapeuticdrugs (Saraiva et al., 2020).As opposed to parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008), parvifloroneF (Srancikova et al., 2013) has been shown to induce cell death byavoiding the mitochondrial permeability and initiating analternative pathway that does not involve inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Parviflorone F (Srancikovaet al., 2013) showed anti-proliferative activity ranging from IC50values of 4.49 - 4.99 \u03bcM, across a variety of human cell lines,including TNBC MDA-MB231, breast cancer MCF-7 and lungcarcinoma A549. It has been suggested that the oxidation level ofthe abietane ring affects the antiproliferative selectivity of thecompound.When compared to parvifloroneD (Salim et al., 2008),parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013) demonstrated highercytotoxicity in Vero cell lines (Garcia et al., 2019).Since P. ecklonii is a common species of South Africa,antitumour drug development using isolated compounds (Salimet al., 2008) and (Srancikova et al., 2013) could be of importance forcountries with less access to other resources. When compared tothe preparation of the common anticancer treatment paclitaxel,extracting parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008) and F (Srancikovaet al., 2013) from the aerial parts of P. ecklonii could be moreaccessible than, for example, from the bark of the Pacific yew tree(Taxus brevifolia). P. ecklonii is a source of different bioactivecompounds, not just one of key interest, as in the case of T.brevifolia, therefore, in terms of economising and sustainable use ofresources from natural products, P. ecklonni could be a legitamatealternative. Furthermore, with parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008)and F (Srancikova et al., 2013) being recorded as demonstartingeven higher antitumour activity than standard antitumour agents,the appliaction of using these compounds for in vitro investigationstandards could be considered. The diterpene sugiol (deAlbuquerque et al., 2007) demonstrated preferential inhibitionof topoisomerase 1, with an IC50 value of 2.8 \u00b5M, lower thanthat of camptothecin (28.0 \u00b5M) (Fronza et al., 2012). Reportedadverse effects of camptothecin have reduced it\u2019s clinical use,providing the oppourtity for alternative drug leads. Given itsrecorded potency, (de Albuquerque et al., 2007) should befurther investigated for use in cancer therapy. Compounds, suchas abietane diterpenes, could be studied in combination withcurrent clinical drugs, to improve their activity, overcomeresistances or mitigate and/or prevent adverse effects. All theseresults suggests potential therapeutic properties for Parvifloron D(Salim et al., 2008), specially with the help of the nanotechnology toenhance its solubility.With parviflorones D (Salim et al., 2008) andF (Srancikova et al., 2013) being recorded as demonstrating evenhigher antitumour activity than standard antitumour agents, theappliaction of these compounds for in vitro standard studies couldbe considered, as well as in combinationwith current clinical drugs,to improve their activity, overcome resistances or mitigate and/orprevent adverse effects.FIGURE 7 | Abietane 2\u00df-(4-hydroxy)benzoyloxy.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826815Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiThe antitumour activity and multifunctionality oftriterpenoids is attributed to different mechanisms, including,inhibiting NF-\u03baB and topoisomerases activation, inducing anapoptotic response, blocking signal transducer and activatingangiogenesis and transcription (D\u2019yakonov et al., 2017). Theuse of triterpenic compounds, such as UA (Lukhoba et al.,2006) and OA (Dellar et al., 1996), has long beenrecommended in Japan as a skin cancer therapy (Muto et al.,1990) since both acids have effectively inhibited the promotionand initiation of skin tumours in rats. Cosmetic preparationscontaining one or both acids are even patented in Japan fortopical preventive use of skin cancer (Liu, 1995). There is at leastone patented pharmaceutical preparation containing OA (Dellaret al., 1996) for the treatment of non-lymphatic leukaemia(granulocytic and monocytic) without adverse side effects (Liu,1986). Several studies have indicated that UA (Lukhoba et al.,2006) and its derivatives inhibit the growth of cancer cells byinterrupting the cell cycle and stimulating apoptosis (Liu, 2005).In HT-29 colon cancer cells, UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) decreasedcell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner,suggesting that it may be a potent agent for the treatment ofcolorectal cancer (Andersson et al., 2003; Shan et al., 2009).Another study suggests UA (Lukhoba et al., 2006) as apotential chemopreventive agent in metastatic breast cancer(Yoeh et al., 2010). Cancer is a multifactorial disease, withmultiple symptoms and targets; interest in drugs possessingmultiple biological actions, such as antitumour and anti-inflammatory, are of increasing interest for their combinationsof action, rather than single modes of action. As an example,COX-2 and Leukotrienes (LTs) are involved in the inflammatoryprocess, which have also been linked to the mechanisms of actioninvolved in cancer. In colon cancer HT-29 cells, antitumoureffects of RA (Rice et al., 2011) have been related to its abilityto inhibit COX-2 activation by AP-1 inducing agents (Hossanet al., 2014). LTs are significantly involved in theimmunoregulation process of various inflammatory-dependentdiseases, including asthma, and various allergic conditions Theyare initially biosynthesized by 5-LOX from arachidonic acid. CA(Pal et al., 2011) has been shown to have anti-inflammatoryproperties as a selective inhibitor of 5-LOX and thus of LTbiosynthesis (Yasuko et al., 1984). CA (Pal et al., 2011) alsoinhibits PKC (Gamaro et al., 2011) and the activation of NF-kB,induced by ceramides in humanmyeloid leukaemia cell line U937(Nardini et al., 2001). CA (Pal et al., 2011) was found to diminishNO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in LPS-stimulatedRAW264.7 cells. Additionally, mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, COX-2,and iNOS were downregulated by CA (Pal et al., 2011) (Yanget al., 2013).Due to the multiple biological activities of flavonoids(anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, andantibacterial), there have been many studies towards theirapplication as anti-tumour and radiosensitizing agents. Forexample, cirsiliol (Uchida et al., 1980) has been investigated asa possible radiosensitizer in non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) (Kang et al., 2013). Most lung cancer patients arediagnosed at an advanced and inoperable stage, withradiotherapy being their only effective treatment option.Unfortunately, radioresistance of tumours remains a criticalobstacle (Provencio et al., 2010). Results show that cirsiliol(Uchida et al., 1980) reduces the proliferation of NSCLC byinhibiting the expression (but not activation) of the Notch-1gene (Kang et al., 2013).Several studies have shown that many flavonoids, includingluteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) and apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010),inhibit the proliferation of various normal and tumoral cells,derived from almost all tissues (Packer et al., 2004). Apigenin(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) is a powerful inhibitor of cell proliferationand angiogenesis in human endothelial cells. It inhibits theexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) viaalpha-1 hypoxia inducing factor degradation (HIF-1\u03b1) (Osadaet al., 2004) and the growth of human cervical carcinoma HeLacells and neuroblastoma cell lines, a paediatric tumour (Zhenget al., 2005). Apoptosis of HeLa cells by inducing p53 geneexpression suggests the potential of apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al.,2010) in the development of a preventive agent for cervicalcancer. Another study confirmed this chemopreventive actionof apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010), this time in the treatment ofpancreatic cancer, by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation (Wuet al., 2014). Although it does not appear so, the anti-proliferativecell activity of flavonoids is specific, depending on the type of celland the structure of the flavonoid. For example, neither apigenin(Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) nor luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) shows thesignificant growth-inhibiting activity of 4A5 cells in melanomaB16 (Packer et al., 2004).AntioxidantThe current modern-day lifestyle causes excessive free radicalproduction and reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Antioxidants are defined as compounds that can delay,inhibit, or prevent the oxidation of oxidizable materials byscavenging free radicals and diminishing oxidative stress (OS)(Dai and Mumper, 2010). The production of free radicals iscommon place during normal aerobic cellular metabolism andcan perform various functions as signalling and provideprotection against infections (Sharma et al., 2012). However,free radical overproduction results in OS, a detrimentalprocess that can cause oxidative damage of differentbiomolecules (such as enzymes, proteins, lipids, and nucleicacids) inhibiting their normal function and causing manydiseases (Valko et al., 2007). OS has been implicated in thedevelopment of chronic degenerative diseases, includingcardiovascular and respiratory diseases, neurodegenerativedisorders (Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease(PD)), diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and differenttypes of cancer, as well as in the aging process (Phaniendraet al., 2015), discovering natural compounds with goodscavenging capacity against ROS imperative.Plant antioxidants are composed of a broad variety of differentsubstances like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols,polyphenolic compounds, or terpenoids (Gra\u00dfmann, 2005).Evidence of terpene antioxidant behaviour comes from theincreasing number of publications published in recent years,focusing on their source, structures, and mechanisms, throughwhich they exert their pharmacological and possible therapeuticFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826816Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiactivities (Gonzalez-Burgos and Gomez-Serranillos, 2012). Oneof the most frequently employed methods used to detect thepresence of antioxidant compounds is the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH\u2022) radical scavenging assay (Akar et al.,2017). In 2005, Chao and colleagues reported that although sugiol(de Albuquerque et al., 2007) had low inhibitory activity againstDPPH radical, it could effectively reduce intracellular productionof ROS in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages(Chao et al., 2005). When compared to the standardcompound, ascorbic acid, sugiol (de Albuquerque et al., 2007)showed significant scavenging activities of DPPH, nitric oxide(NO), superoxide, and hydroxyl free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner (Bajpai et al., 2014). Besides, sugiol (deAlbuquerque et al., 2007) showed an inhibitory effect of lipidperoxidation of 76.5% compared with \u03b1-tocopherol (80.13%) andbutylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) (76.5%), two well-knownsynthetic antioxidants. However, increasing concernconcerning these synthetic antioxidants in promoting liverdamage and carcinogenic processes merits the search foralternative antioxidant sources, such as, from Plectranthus spp.Another diterpene isolated from P. ecklonii which demonstrateddose-dependent anti-radical activity was parviflorone D (Salimet al., 2008). This compound had antioxidant propertiesequivalent to hydroxyl butyltoluene (BHT), but lower thanquercetin, two other synthetic antioxidants (Rijo et al., 2009).The antioxidant activity of parviflorone F (Srancikova et al., 2013)and E (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002), isolated from the leaves of P.nummularius Briq., was also evaluated by the DPPH method.Both compounds showed a higher uptake capacity of the DPPHradical than that of the \u03b1-tocopherol (Narukawa et al., 2001). It ismost probable that the quinone moiety present in the abietanediterpenes, such as in parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008), aids instabilizing free radicals.Phenolic acids, tannins and flavonoid compounds, which aresubgroups of phenolics, are known to be potent antioxidants (Ramuet al., 2012). Studies demonstrate a positive and highly significantrelationship between total phenolics and antioxidant activity(Velioglu et al., 1998; Pulido et al., 2000; Zheng and Wang, 2001;\u00d6zgen et al., 2006). Phenolic compounds have been recognized aspowerful antioxidants in vitro and have proven to be more potentantioxidants thanVitamin C, E, and carotenoids (Pulido et al., 2000).Authors suggest phenolic antioxidant properties to be mediated bythree main mechanisms: 1. scavenging radical species such as ROS/RNS; 2. suppressing ROS/RNS formation by the inhibition of severalenzymes or chelating trace metals involved in the production of freeradical production; 3. upregulating or protecting antioxidant defence(Dai and Mumper, 2010).The structure of phenolic compounds is a key determinant oftheir radical scavenging and metal chelating activity, and this isreferred to as SAR (Aberoumand and Deokule, 2008).Hydroxycinnamic acids have higher antioxidant activity than thecorresponding hydroxybenzoic acids, which may be a result of theCH\u0001CH-COOH group, which guarantees the greater capacity todonate hydrogen ions (H+) and stabilize radicals than the carboxylgroup. CA (Pal et al., 2011) acts particularly well as a donor ofhydrogen atoms, mainly thanks to the extra stability given to thephenoxy radical, resulting from interaction with the adjacenthydroxyl group(s) by hydrogen bonds (Balasundram et al.,2006). By having a hydroxyl in para-position relative to thelateral chain, it also easily captures a radical. Besides, it canfluctuate between hydrophilic and lipophilic, which makes iteasier for the compound to access areas where there is oxidizedvitamin E and, subsequently, can regenerate it (Scott, 1997). In vitroand in vivo experiments have demonstrated the exceptionalantioxidant activity of RA (Rice et al., 2011) against peroxidativedamage to biological membranes. RA (Rice et al., 2011) is an ester ofCA (Pal et al., 2011) with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid (Petersen,2013), the major component of polar extracts from many plants ofthe Lamiaceae family (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009) and, presumably, one of themain compounds responsible for the potent antioxidant activity ofLamiaceae plants (Ozgen et al., 2008). The four phenolic hydrogensaccount for this compound\u2019s ability to modulate free radicalscavenging. In combination with two catechol moieties, thatprovide the suitable polarity for (Rice et al., 2011) to penetratethe lipid bilayers, RA (Rice et al., 2011) has shown to protect againstoxidation, without disturbing themolecular structure (Amoah et al.,2016). RA (Rice et al., 2011) protects neurons from OS bysignificantly reducing H2O2-induced ROS production andapoptosis cell death, showing the potential application inneurodegenerative diseases, such as PD and Huntingdon\u2019sDisease (HD) (Bhatt et al., 2013). In 2003, Grayer and colleaguesdemonstrated that the CA (Pal et al., 2011) derivative, nepetoidin B(Nyila et al., 2009), isolated from the aqueous extracts of P. eckloniileaves, has a potent free radical trapping activity (Grayer et al.,2003). Compound (Nyila et al., 2009), nepetoidin B, has been tested,together with three known antioxidants (gallic acid, RA (Rice et al.,2011), and CA (Pal et al., 2011), using the DPPH test. Nepetoidin B(Nyila et al., 2009) showed a higher capacity to capture free radicalsthan acids (Rice et al., 2011) and (Pal et al., 2011). Nepetoidin A(Van Jaarsveld, 2006) has not been tested enough to gathersufficient evidence. However, even low concentrations of thesubstance have resulted in a considerable colour loss of a DPPHsolution, indicating that nepetoidin A (Van Jaarsveld, 2006) is likelyto have strong antioxidant activity as well.Flavonoid antioxidant activity is attributed to their capabilityto recapture free radicals and chelate metals (Bilto et al., 2012), aswell as their effects on cell signalling and gene expression(Soobrattee et al., 2005). The in vitro antioxidant capacity offlavonoids has been intensively studied over the past years and,based on SAR studies, it is predicted that their antioxidant activitydepends on its chemical structure, corresponding to the numberand position of hydroxyl groups (Amic et al., 2007). In vivoantioxidant efficacy of flavonoids appears less in the literature(Pietta, 2000). The antioxidant activity improves notably when C-3\u2019 and C-4\u2019 positions in ring \u201cB\u201d are occupied by hydroxyl groups(Figure 4). As for ring \u201cA\u201d, phenolic hydroxyl groups contributesomewhat to the antioxidant activity, due to the electrophiliceffect of ring \u201cC\u201d (Lin et al., 2014). The presence of ortho-di-hydroxyl (catechol) group on the \u201cB\u201d ring and the double bondbetween C2-C3 in conjugation with an oxo group at C4 are keystructural features of antioxidant flavonoids, since the catecholgroup stabilizes radical species. Luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) andits glycosides (e.g. luteolin 7-O-glucoside (Kub\u00ednov\u00e1 et al., 2013))satisfy these structural necessities, therefore, it is not surprisingFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826817Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniithat many luteolin-containing plants possess antioxidantproperties, through their ability to scavenge ROS and RNS(L\u00f3pez-L\u00e1zaro, 2009). In a study of the copper chelatingproperties of luteolin-7-O-glucoside (Kub\u00ednov\u00e1 et al., 2013)and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003), the ortho-3\u2019,4\u2019-dihydroxysubstitution in the B-ring, in the case of luteolin (Grayer et al.,2003), was suggested as being important for copper chelation,thereby influencing its antioxidant activity (Brown and Rice-Evans, 1998).There is also evidence in the literature that simultaneoushydroxylation of C3 and C5 flavonoids is another importantstructural feature involved in maximizing the potential for freeradical scavenging, in determining antioxidant activity (Borset al., 1990; Soobrattee et al., 2005). Besides, the existence of aportion of sugar in the C8 position of vitexin (Gaspar-Marqueset al., 2006) significantly decreases the antioxidant efficacy of thiscompound compared to its non-glycosylated derivative (Sim\u00f5eset al., 2010) (Soobrattee et al., 2005). The antioxidant activity ofthe flavones salvigenin (Van Zyl et al., 2008), cirsimaritin (Nyilaet al., 2012), and genkwanin (Zschocke et al., 2000) have beenevaluated by the qualitative tests of DPPH and the discolorationof \u00df-carotene. They all tested negative for DPPH, which meansthat they do not pick-up radicals by this method. Salvigenin (VanZyl et al., 2008) was the only one to test positive for beta-carotenebleaching, which may indicate preventive antioxidant activity,possibly related to the absorption of UV radiation (Gaspar-Marques et al., 2006). Preventive antioxidants can becompounds with the ability to absorb UV rays, superoxidedismutase enzymes, catalases, and peroxidases, or compoundswith the ability to chelate or reduce transition metals (Scott,1997). The use of flavones in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s diseasefocuses on the inflammation process underlying the progressionof the disease. This therapeutic approach is based on thepreventive action of flavones in the face of OS and consequentinflammation by acting as antioxidants by capturing free radicals.Anti-inflammatorySeveral studies have shown that triterpenoids significantly suppresschronic inflammation by modulating proinflammatory mediators.The anti-inflammatory effects of pentacyclic triterpenoids are largelyascribed to their ability to inhibit molecular targets such as 5-lipoxygenase (LOX), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB)activities (Yap and Lim, 2015). The anti-inflammatory effects of UA(Lukhoba et al., 2006) have been attributed to its ability to suppressnuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation, which, together with NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and AP-1 (activator protein-1), regulate inflammatory genes (Checker et al., 2012). Anotherpotential application of this compound could be in the treatmentof osteoarthritis since the activation of NF-kB is critical in thepathophysiology of osteoarthritis (Gabay et al., 2010). Thepotential anti-inflammatory activity of sugiol (de Albuquerqueet al., 2007) and the relationship between signal transduction andinflammatory cytokines was evaluated in vitro (Chao et al., 2005). Adose of 30 \u00b5M of sugiol effectively inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, prointerleukin-1beta, IL-1\u03b2, and tumournecrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), suggesting that sugiol (deAlbuquerque et al., 2007) is bioactive against inflammation. Theauthors suggested that the efficacy of sugiol (de Albuquerque et al.,2007) in inhibiting inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and TNF-\u03b1 couldbe attributed to a reduction of ROS, which in turn causes a decrease inthe phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).The anti-inflammatory properties of RA (Rice et al., 2011) arethought to be based on the inhibition of LOX and COX, on theinterference with the complement cascade and the inhibition ofexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Another study has shownthat CA (Pal et al., 2011) derivatives exert anti-inflammatoryaction in vitro and in vivo and their action is mediated, at leastpartially, by NO recapture (Da Cunha et al., 2004). Nakanishi andcolleagues reported potent inhibition of xanthine oxidase by bothNepetoidin A (Van Jaarsveld, 2006) and B (Nyila et al., 2009) andparticularly by nepetedoin B (Nyila et al., 2009), suggesting thatthis compound could have the potential for the control ofhyperuricemia in human gout (Nakanishi et al., 1990).The anti-inflammatory effect of phenolic compounds isrelated to the ability to modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as phospholipase A2, nitric oxidesynthase (NOS), COX, and LOX. Inhibition of these enzymes byflavonoids reduces the production of arachidonic acid,prostaglandins (PG), LTs, and NO, crucial mediators ofinflammation. In general, flavones have a greater inhibitoryeffect on NO production than flavonols (Kim et al., 2004).Different flavonoids, such as quercetin, apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al.,2010) and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003), have been reported topossess anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (Kumar andPandey, 2013). Apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) showed stronganti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of NO and iNOSproduction, and inhibition of COX-2 expression. Inhibition ofiNOS and NO production is also attributed to luteolin (Grayeret al., 2003) (Choi et al., 2014). Apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) andluteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) also inhibit interleukin (IL)-5, whichpromotes the growth and survival of eosinophils and plays animportant role in allergic inflammation associated witheosinophilia (Packer et al., 2004). In an in vitro study, bothflavones showed potent inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 synthesis(Hirano et al., 2004), and both have an inhibitory action on LOXand pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 (Lago et al.,2014). On a structural level, the requirements for the anti-inflammatory activity of the flavonoids include unsaturation inthe C-ring (between C2 and C3); the number and position ofhydroxyl groups (e.g., the catechol group in the B-ring); thecarbonyl group in C4; and the non-glycosylation of the molecule.However, compounds that do not have these structuralcharacteristics also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, affectingenzymes of the inflammatory cascade (Lago et al., 2014). Data inthe literature strongly suggest that the double bond between C2and C3 is crucial for inhibiting NO production and that hydroxylsubstitutions in the A and B rings influence inhibitory activity(Figure 4). Hydroxylation on positions 5- and/or 7- of the A-ring,and in positions 3\u2019- and/or 4\u2019- of the B-ring provide favourableresults for inhibition of production, the opposite if hydroxylationis in carbon 3 (C-ring) (Kim et al., 1999). Apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al.,2010) and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) are among the flavonoidscited as the most active inhibitors. The anti-inflammatory effectFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826818Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniiof luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003), its glucosides and plantscontaining luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) have been testedin vitro and in vivo (L\u00f3pez-L\u00e1zaro, 2009). In an in vitro SARstudy, luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003) showed high inhibitoryactivity of thromboxane and LT synthesis, and in particularagainst the enzyme activity of LTs. Cinaroside (Kub\u00ednov\u00e1et al., 2013) (luteolin-7-O-\u00dfglucoside) showed only moderateinhibitory activity against both enzyme synthesis pathways(Odontuya et al., 2005). These results support the idea that thehydroxyl substitute in the C5 position and the non-glycosylationof the molecule contribute significantly to the anti-inflammatoryactivity of the flavonoids. In vivo studies have shown that luteolin(Grayer et al., 2003) effectively protects mouse induced LPSlethality, suggesting the application of this compound as apotential therapeutic agent in septic decay treatment (Kuoet al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014).Enzyme InhibitionTyrosinase is one of the keys enzymes in the biosynthesis ofmelanin, the pigment responsible for determining skin and haircolour. The inhibition of tyrosinase is one of the major strategiesto treat skin hyperpigmentation, one of the common skincomplaints that affect people of all skin types. Inhibitors of thetyrosinase enzyme, such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, and azelaicacid, have been used to treat hyperpigmentation disorders butdespite their efficacy, many of these agents are frequentlyreported to have numerous limitations, such as highcytotoxicity, poor skin penetration, and low stability informulations (Otang-Mbeng and Sagbo, 2020). Therefore,there has been a growing demand for products that act safelyand effectively when inhibiting enzymatic oxidation, to preventhyperpigmentation (Nerya et al., 2004). One of the traditionalpreparations, a paste made from the leaves of P. ecklonii, is used inZimbabwe for skin diseases and skin hyperpigmentationproblems.P. ecklonii ethyl acetate extract and its isolated compounds,parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008) and F (Srancikova et al., 2013),were tested for their tyrosinase inhibitory action in comparison tokojic acid. The concentration at which half the tyrosinase activitywas inhibited (IC50) by the extract was 61.7 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b5g/ml. Duringcytotoxicity evaluation, compounds (Salim et al., 2008) and(Srancikova et al., 2013), were toxic against monkey kidneyVero cell lines, as shown by their IC50 values (Nyila et al.,2009). Nevertheless, the activity demonstrated by the rawextract of P. ecklonii in the tyrosinase test, together with itsantibacterial activity against S. aureus, helps to justify thetraditional use of the plant in skin-related diseases (Lukhobaet al., 2006). In a more recent study, the high chelating ability ofabietane diterpenes, found in P. ecklonii, was attributed to theobserved anti-tyrosinase activity, in vitro, and was consideredalmost as efficient as kojic acid, the positive control. Thecombination of polyphenolic compounds, such as quercetin,with abietane diterpenes, has shown a synergistic effect thatpromotes both anti-tyrosinase and antioxidant activity, suitablefor skin treatment, such as, anti-pigmentation (Andrade et al., 2021).Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme that catalyses thehydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) (Dviret al., 2010). Nowadays, the most effective therapy forAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) consists of increasing the levels ofACh through the inhibition of AChE activity (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009).The literature indicates that terpenoids and, in particular, somediterpenoids, may have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity (Dviret al., 2010). To date, no references to the inhibitory effect ofAChE by diterpenes with an abietane skeleton isolated from P.ecklonii have been found in the literature.AChE is the target of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors used whenaddressing the cholinergic deficit in AD patients. The leading ADtherapeutics involve AChE inhibitors, which produce an increaseof the acetylcholine concentrations in the synaptic cleft, enhancingthe cholinergic transmission. Despite decades of research, currentpharmacotherapeutic options for AD are still very limited andrepresent an area of need that is currently unmet. Studies indicatethat species of the Lamiaceae family are a bountiful source ofvarying natural AChE inhibitors and antioxidants that could beuseful in the prevention and treatment of AD and other relateddiseases (Vladimir-Kne\u017eevi\u0107 et al., 2014). In a study with P.barbatus, the presence of RA (Rice et al., 2011), a compoundwhich is also found in P. ecklonii, has been attributed to theantioxidant activity found in vitro and the inhibition of AChE,where high inhibition activity was demonstrated in the decoction(31% inhibition). The authors also analysed other Plectranthusspp., P. ecklonii, P. fructicosus, P. lanuginosus, and P. verticillatus,where they compared the RA (Rice et al., 2011) content of theplants. P. ecklonii was the species studied that gave the highestinhibition activity (62.8%) (Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009). In a study looking fornew treatment strategies for AD, the in vitro AChE inhibition,antioxidant activity, and bioactive components of five different spp.of Plectranthus (P. ecklonii including) were investigated. The maincomponents of the aqueous extracts, rosmarinic (Rice et al., 2011),chlorogenic (Chassagne and Morgan, 2020) and caffeic (Pal et al.,2011) acids, were quantified. The decoctions showed high AChEinhibitory and antioxidant activities for P. ecklonii and P. saccatus(Gomes et al., 2012). According to these studies, the aqueousextracts and decoctionmethod is the best way to evaluate the AChEactivity of P. ecklonii. It has also been stated that the most activeextracts were obtained from the leaves as opposed to the flowers(Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009). The activity of other enzymes, such ascollagenase inhibition, in aqueous extracts of P. ecklonii, hasrecently been established with rosmarinic (Rice et al., 2011)being attributed to promoting the highest amount of biologicalactivity at 4.5%. However, the presence of CA (Pal et al., 2011) inthe extracts could also be considered accountable for theincreased activity and further studies would be required topositively identify the compounds responsible for the enzymeinhibition (Andrade et al., 2021). RA\u2019s (Rice et al., 2011)inhibitory activity of the enzyme glycosyltransferase (GTF)has been highlighted (Figueiredo et al., 2010) and thepresence of this compound has also been linked to theobserved effects of AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity(Fal\u00e9 et al., 2009). The flavones vitexin (Gaspar-Marques et al.,2006), isovitexin (Amoah et al., 2016) and naturally occurringC-glycosylated derivatives of apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) havedemonstrated anti-AD activity (Choi et al., 2014), againFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 76826819Ant\u00e3o et al. Comprehensive Review of Plectranthus eckloniipromptly the need for further studies of this species tocorroborate these findings.CONCLUSIONWith the growing acceptance of alternative forms of health care,such as traditional medicine, new requirements are also emerging.Compound screening is needed to clarify which molecules areresponsible for biological activities, to scientifically validate popularplant uses. Secondary metabolites found in plants provide animmeasurable wealth of structurarly diverse compounds withassociated bioactivities The genus Plectranthus, for its diverseethnobotanical applications and the several biological effects(antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour),has been suggested as a promising source for the discovery ofbioactive compounds. In this sense, the isolation of secondarymetabolites from Plectranthus species and the understanding of theorigin of their therapeutic properties is imperative and canguarantee effective and safe use. In this work not only havesome of the traditional uses of P. ecklonii been validated, butthe potential of this plant as a prospective source of new drug leadshas been demonstrated. From the species P. ecklonii Benth., 28compounds have been isolated to date. As observed in otherPlectranthus species studied over the years, the predominantclasses are terpenes and phenolic compounds. Eight diterpeneswere identified in P. ecklonii, four of them being diterpenes with anabietane skeleton (1, 2, 9, and 27), two being triterpenes (12 and13) and two being identified as sterols (14 and 15). Regardingphenolic compounds, twelve flavones (19-24, 26 and 28-31) andone flavanone (Costa et al., 2018) were isolated, in addition to CA(Pal et al., 2011) and four of its derivatives (3, 4, 5, and 16). Theliterature reports RA (Rice et al., 2011) as the predominantcompound in the aqueous extracts of P. ecklonii. Phytochemicalstudies have reported the isolation of two isomeric o-quinones,ecklonoquinones A (\u015aliwi\u0144ski et al., 2020) and B (Andrade et al.,2018) from P. ecklonii which have not been analysed in this workbecause no reference was found in the literature concerning anybioactivities (Uchida et al., 1980). Among the diterpenes, the mostrecent studies emphasise the major abietane diterpenoid,parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008), for its potential in cancertherapy, particularly when combined with nanotechnology, andsugiol (de Albuquerque et al., 2007) has also demonstrated itsanticancer potential as an effective topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. Themain phenolic compound, rosmarinic acid (Rice et al., 2011),mainly exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity,although photoprotective and melanogenic properties have alsobeen described. Anti-inflammatory activity has also been attributedto sugiol (de Albuquerque et al., 2007), caffeic acid (Pal et al., 2011),apigenin (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2010) and luteolin (Grayer et al., 2003). Thediterpenes parviflorone D (Salim et al., 2008), E (Abdel-Mogibet al., 2002), F (Srancikova et al., 2013) and sugiol (de Albuquerqueet al., 2007) all showed antioxidant activity as well as oleanolic acid(Dellar et al., 1996), caffeic acid (Pal et al., 2011) and Nepetoidin B(Nyila et al., 2009).The antimicrobial activity of Plectranthusecklonii has been attributed to parviflorone D (Salim et al.,2008) and F (Srancikova et al., 2013), the latter also showingsimilar antimalarial activity similar to that of chloroquine.Adittionally, (2) and (Abdel-Mogib et al., 2002) were reportedto be more effective than quinine. As an ornamental plant, withmultiple compounds showing anticancer activity, P. eckloniicould become an accessible source for antitumour drugs.Since P. ecklonii is a common species of South Africa, interms of economising and the sustainable use of resourcesfrom natural products, P. ecklonii could be a legitamatealternative to current antitumour drugs. However, the lack ofdata and information on possible side effects and saftey of thisspecies warrants further investigation, to assess the safety of thisplant for clinical and therapeutic use.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSConceptualization, AMA and PR; methodology, AMA, GB andED; formal analysis, AMA, GB, and ED, investigation, AMA andGB; re-writing of original draft preparation, AMA; review-writing and editing, GB and ED; figures preparation, ED;supervision, AD, and PR; funding acquisition, AD and PR.All authors have read and agreed to the published version ofthe manuscript.FUNDINGThis work was financially supported in part by FCT \u2013 Fundac\u00e3opara a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia grants PEst-OE/SAU/UI4013/2014,UID/DTP/04567/2016, UIDB/04567/2020 and UIDP/04567/2020; and INSTITUTO LUS\u00d3FONO DE INVESTIGA\u00c7\u00c3O EDESENVOLVIMENTO (ILIND) for the project COFAC/ILIND/CBIOS/1/2020.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSED-M gratefully acknowledges being the recipient of apredoctoral FPU 2019 fellowship from the University ofAlcal\u00e1 de Henares.REFERENCESAbdel-Mogib, M., Albar, H., and Batterjee, S.
