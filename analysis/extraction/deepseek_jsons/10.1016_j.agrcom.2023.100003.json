Published by Elsthe CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommonsA B S T R A C TPimpinella anisum L. (Apiaceae), known around the world as aniseed, is a widely cultivated crop, native of the sub-Mediterranean area. Its essential oil (EO) is exploitable in different fields such as food and beverages, pharma-ceutics, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals. Regardless of the geographic origin, the EO exhibited consistent trans-anethole predominancy. Among the numerous biological properties exerted by aniseed EO, its antimicrobial,antifungal, insecticidal, and acaricidal effects have been extensively investigated for the formulation of bio-pesticides against larvae and adults of various pests and vectors. Hereafter, the published data on the insecticidaland acaricidal activity of aniseed EO and its major compounds on agricultural pests, stored-product pests, andarthropods of medical and veterinary interest is reviewed. For each study, the arthropod and the developmentalstage on which the aniseed EO or the aniseed EO-based formulation were tested, the mode of action, the mainconstituents, and the exerted mortality, as well as the toxicity to non-target organisms and the possible sub-lethaleffects are reported. The advantages of the possible use of aniseed EO as a biopesticide are analysed, as well as thecurrent weaknesses and the critical points to be overcome to open the doors to the industrial utilization ofApiaceae EOs by the agrochemical industry.1. Introduction1.1. Distribution and agronomic practicesThe anise or aniseed, Pimpinella anisum L., is an aromatic plantbelonging to the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). Locally known withseveral other names, such as anis vert, anisoon, sweet cumin, yansoon,roomy, or saunf [1,2], this aromatic plant is native to Southwest Asia,Greece, Egypt [3] and India [2]. Anise cultivation dates back to Roman,Greek, and Egyptian times, when the fruits were employed for medicalpurposes [3,4]. Nowadays, its cultivation has widely expanded due to itsseveral applications in food, beverages, andmedicinal industries. Turkey,Mexico, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Syria, France, Brazil, South Africa, LatinAmerica, Bulgaria, and Tunisia are all important aniseed producers,while Germany and India became the main exporters of this spice [3,5\u20137]. The cultivation of aniseed requires sunshine and warm climates,nelli).7 May 2023; Accepted 22 May 20evier B.V. on behalf of Beijing Ac.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).although this plant may also thrive in areas where low temperatures donot exceed 160\u2013180 days. The plant prefers fertile, or relatively rich,well-drained sandy loam soils, and requires regular care with sporadicweeding [4,5]. Bhuvaneshwari et al. [4] demonstrated that the simul-taneous use of 80 kg ha\u00011 of nitrogen and 60 kg ha\u00011 of phosphorus andpotassium led to improved yields in terms of number of leaves, plantheight, total leaf area, seed yield, number of fruits per umbel, and size ofthe umbel. The traditional practice of aniseed farming involves plough-ing the fields and adding fertilizer (manure) during autumn months,while sowing should be conducted in April for successful cultivation [8,9]. The germination of the shoots starts after a month, and the vegetativegrowth is very swift following the development of the first leaves. Thefruits are the most used part of the plant and are harvested by shaking thecrop between August and September when they are still slightly dampand dark in colour [8].23ademy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences.

Morphology and anatomyP. anisum is an annual grassy herb which grows up to 30\u201350 cm withwhite flowers and small green to yellow seeds. The root primary state ofgrowth lasts two weeks, while the secondary growth takes place in the 3rdand 4th weeks. Secondary phloem of older roots presents pericyclic secre-tory canals. Casparian thickenings can be noted in the endodermis, and thestems are often ribbed [10]. The leaves are dorsiventral, and the hairs arenon-glandular and come in unicellular, dendroid, and stellate types.Secretory canals in the petiole and leaf lamina create a distinctive blend ofoils, resin, andmucilage. The petiole is usually providedwith an arc or ringof vascular bundles [11,12]. Flowers are terminal, small, bisexual, andepigynous. The sepals and calyx are absent. The corolla consists of fiveincurved petals, white in colour and distinct, with a retuse and valvate apex[13,14]. The fruit is a dry schizocarp, ovate and laterally compressed,consisting of two mericarps, each corresponding to one carpel containingone seed. The mericarp is about 3\u20135 mm long and 1.5\u20132 mm wide; it isovoid-conical, greyish-brown, rough to the touch, and equipped with a se-ries of vittae arranged in a circle to protect the seed. Onemericarp is fertile,and the other is usually sterile. The fruit is orthospermous, i.e., the seedscontained in the carpels are flat on the inner surface, showing small dicot-yledonous embryos at the apical end [15\u201317].1.3. Traditional and medicinal usesP. anisum fruits are traditionally used in many countries for thetreatment of several diseases [18\u201320]. The first documented use of3P. anisum fruits dates back to the 5th century in China, when they wereused as an herbal remedy [21,22]. In ancient medical books, aniseed isreported as anti-asthma and anticonvulsant agent, and as a remedy fordigestive disorders, dyspnea, and gynaecological problems [23]. In theIranian traditional medicine, it is used as diuretic, carminative, andanalgesic [24], and it is reported against melancholy, nightmares,seizure, and epilepsy in ancient texts [25,26].Aniseed is part of the cultural experience of several countries, such asIndia [5], Palestine [27], Lebanon [28], Korea [29], and also Europeancountries (e.g. United Kingdom and Italy) [6,30]. Notably, it is used forbronchial catarrh, pertussis, spasmodic cough, flatulent colic, insomnia,and constipation; externally, for pediculosis and scabies [29,31\u201333]. InTurkish medicine, it has an important role for its antifungal, antibacte-rial, and antiviral properties, as well as its anti-inflammatory, and hep-ato\u2013protective activities [18,34,35].1.4. Application in food, beverages, and cosmetic industriesFor their pleasant odour and flavour, aniseed fruits acquired a greateconomic importance in food and beverages flavourings [36]. In somecountries, P. anisum fruits are used for liquor, which is prepared withdefined procedures and called with a specific name by each culture.Specifically, they derive by the distillation of dregs, grapes, and otherfermented products, enriched with aniseed aroma. In the Mediterraneanarea, many aniseed spirit drinks like ouzo (Greek), anesone (Spain),pastis, and pernod (France), sambuca (Italy), zebib (Egypt), raki(Turkey), and arak (Syria) can be found [37]. Moreover, it is extensivelyTable 2Biological activities reported for P. anisum essential oil (EO).Biological activity Effect ReferencesAntibacterial Paenibacillus larvae MICa of 300 \u03bcg/mL [155]Streptococcushaemolyticusinhibition zone (IZ)of 19 mm[156]Staphilococcus aureus MIC of 125.0 \u03bcg/mL [157]Bacillus cereus MIC of 62.5 \u03bcg/mLEscherichia coli MIC >500.0 \u03bcg/mLProteus vulgaris MIC of 62.5 \u03bcg/mLProteus mirabilis MIC of 125.0 \u03bcg/mLSalmonella typhi MIC of 500.0 \u03bcg/mLSalmonella typhimurium MIC of 250.0 \u03bcg/mLKlebsiella pneumoniae MIC >500.0 \u03bcg/mLPseudomonasaeruginosaMIC >500.0 \u03bcg/mLBacillus thuringiensis IZ of 15 mm [158]Bacillus subtilis IZ of 12 mmnative microflora ofSwiss chardMIC of 0.05 mL/100mL[159]Enterococcus faecalis MIC of 4.88% [160]Lactobacillus casei MIC of 9.76%Actinomyces naeslundii MIC of 4.88%AggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitansMIC of 9.76%Antifungal Aspergillus flavus IZ of 20 mm [158]Trichoderma harzianum complete IZAspergillus niger complete growthinhibition of theaggregate strain[161]Aspergillus carbonarius complete growthinhibition of theaggregate strainAspergillus parasiticus reduced thebiosynthesis ofaflatoxin B1[162]Pseudocercosporagriseolacomplete inhibitionof conidalgermination[163]Fusarium oxysporumf.sp. lycopersiciMIC of 0.3 \u03bcL/mL ofair[164]Alternaria alternata IZ increasing atincreasing doses[153]Candida albicans MIC of 0.10\u20130.78%(V/V)[165]Candida parapsilosisCandida tropicalisCandidapseudotropicalisCandida kruseiTrichophyton rubrumTrichophytonmentagrophytesMicrosporum canisMicrosporum gypseumAntiviral PVX (potato virus) complete infectioninhibition at 3000ppm[166]TMV (tobaccomosaicvirus)TRSV (tobacco ringspot virus)Antioxidant \u2013 dose dependentDPPHb radicalscavenging effect[167]Antiinflammatory NF-\u03baB mediatedtranscription inSW1353 cellsIC50 < 100 \u03bcg/mL [168]inhibit the COX-2expressionIC50 of 10.7 \u03bcg/mL [169]Anti-diabetic rat jejunum enhancement ofglucose absorption[28]Anti-convulsant rats decreasedhyperpolarizationpotential, increasedfiring frequency[170]extended latency ofseizure attacks[171]reduced amplitudeand duration ofepileptiform burstdischarges andTable 2 (continued )Biological activity Effect Referencesdark neuronsproductionmale mice suppressed tonicconvulsions[172]increased thresholdof PTZ-inducedclonic convulsionBronchodilatory tracheal muscles ofguinea pigsrelaxant effect [23]Estrogenic YESc assay EC50 of 570 \u03bcg/mL [173]Anticancer HepG2 cell line EC50 of 0.39 mg/mL [59]MCF-7 cell line EC50 of 0.25 mg/mLCaco2 cell line EC50 of 0.30 mg/mLTHP-1 cell line EC50 of 0.11 mg/mLA549 cell line IC50 of 334.2 \u03bcg/mL [81]Palliation ofnauseapatients (case study) relief from thesymptoms[174]Effect onmorphinedependencemice induced conditionedplace aversion andreduced morphineeffect[175]Analgesic mice comparable to thatof morphine andaspirin[176]Effect on broilerperformanceday-old broilers improved feedconversion ratio byapproximately 6%[177]Influence on drugeffectsmice influenced effects ofcodeine, diazepam,midazolam,pentobarbital,imipramine, andfluoxetine on thecentral nervoussystem[178]mice significant decreaseof plasmaconcentration ofacetaminophen andcaffein in mice[179]a MIC, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration.b DPPH, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl.c YES, yeast estrogen screen.E.

Secondary metabolitesP. anisum is a source of several secondary metabolites, and itscomposition has been widely investigated. These compounds aredistributed in all plant parts, but they are particularly concentrated infruits inside the secretory structures (vittae) (Table 1). Generally, aniseedis rich in volatile compounds, phenolic compounds including flavonoids,and tannins [38,39]. Among phenolic compounds, chlorogenic, p-cou-maric, rosmarinic, and gallic acids are the most abundant [40]. On theother hand, the flavonoids detected in aniseed extracts are naringin,apigenin, luteolin, rutin, and quercetin derivatives [40,41]. Phenolicacids and flavonoids have been demonstrated to be responsible for theantioxidant and antimicrobial activities of plant extracts [40]. The con-tent of the above-mentioned secondary metabolites sensibly variesthrough geographical regions, culture conditions, harvesting time, stor-age, and manipulation procedures [42,43]. Concerning primary metab-olites, aniseed contains fatty acids, such as petroselinic, oleic, and linoleicacids as the most abundant unsaturated fatty acids, and palmitic acid asthe main saturated fatty acid [40] (see Table 1).As mentioned above, P. anisum is characterized by a volatile fraction,represented by a fragrant EO, which is mainly composed ofTable 3P. anisum EO activity evaluated against immature and adult stages of arthropods of medical and veterinary interest.

These compounds are the respon-sible for the multiple biological activities associated with the EO(Table 2). Notably, pregeijerene and pseudoisoeugenyl 2-methylbutirateare phytochemical markers for the genus Pimpinella [7].2. Essential oil2.1. Essential oil extractionThe EO of P. anisum is usually obtained from dried schizocarps byhydrodistillation (HD), which, together with steam distillation (SD), isa traditional extractive technique for EOs. These methods are based onthe plant matrix contact with water (for HD) or steam (for SD) and, inboth cases, the aqueous steam crosses the plant material and allows thetransport of the volatile compounds inside an appropriate condenser[44]. Several studies reported the use of HD, also recommended by theEuropean Pharmacopoeia [45], for the extraction of aniseed schizo-carps in deionized water in a 1:10 or 1:20 plant/water ratio forgenerally 2 or 3 h. The EO, which is of a light-yellow colour, is generallyobtained in a yield of 2.0% (w/w) estimated on a dry weight basis[46\u201348]. This yield value is exceeded in the case of the Italian \u2018Cas-tignano ecotype\u2019 aniseed samples, for which the highest obtained yieldwas 5.5%, but also in the case of aniseed from Turkey (5.6%) and otherItalian regions (4.3%) [8]. This noticeable variability in EO amount canbe correlated with the changeable growing, pedoclimatic and storageconditions of aniseed before being harvested and then commercialized[8]. The effect of schizocarps pre-treatment with ultrasounds or mi-crowaves has also been evaluated. In fact, Lotfy et al. [49] highlightedthat both pre-treatments led to higher yields if compared with thetraditional HD process, and the maximum yield (3.0% w/w) was ach-ieved with 60% of ultrasonic power for 30 min. Moreover, microwaveand ultrasound pre-treatments led to an increase in the phenyl-propanoids (mainly represented by trans-anethole) content comparedto the traditional HD.Romdhane and Tizaoui [50] also reported the design of a pilot plantto test SD for the determination of the optimal operating conditions for7P. anisum EO isolation on an industrial level. The EO was obtained in2.55%w/w yield after 2.5 h of extraction, with a pressure of 200 kPa, anda steam flow rate of 6 kg h\u00011 [50]. Besides the above-mentioned tradi-tional extractive techniques, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is alsofrequently performed [51,52]. For instance, Boumahdi et al. [53] carriedout a MAE on P. anisum schizocarps and compared it with traditional HD.In terms of extraction yields, the HD process gave a higher EO yield thanthe MAE (3.30 and 2.81%, respectively). However, MAE led to lowertime and energy consumption than HD (0.089 and 0.438 kWh/g of EO,respectively) [53].2.2. Main constituents and chemotypesP. anisum contains an EO dominated by the phenylpropanoid trans-anethole in percentage varying from 65.6 [54] to 96.9% [9]. Methylchavicol, also called p-allylanisole or estragole, is another phenyl-propanoid that has been reported as the most abundant EO compoundonly in the case of aniseed from Morocco (76.7%) and Yemen (85.3%)[55]. Some studies reported that methyl chavicol was found in percent-ages of 1.6 [56] and 9.8% [57], while others indicated the sesquiterpene\u03b3-himachalene (from 2.1 to 8.3%) [9] as the second most representativeconstituent of aniseed EO. Other minor compounds are \u03b1-terpineol,linalool [3], trans-pseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrate [58,59], cis-anet-hole [60], and anisaldehyde [61]. Pimpinella anisum EO yield andchemical composition are affected by several factors, including thegeographical origin, the growing, pedoclimatic, and harvesting condi-tions, and the extraction methods and parameters. Orav et al. [7]investigated the EO composition of aniseed from different Europeancountries, highlighting the highest contents of trans-anethole in EO fromHungary, Greece, Scotland, Lithuania, Italy, and Germany, while thosefrom Estonia and Russia were particularly rich in \u03b3-himachalene. More-over, EOs from Estonia and France presented a significant amount ofpseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrate and anisaldehyde [7]. Khalid [54]evidenced the importance of nitrogen and phosphorous micronutrientsapplication, especially in desert areas, to enhance aniseed EO yield andcontent of the major compounds [54]. A higher amount of EO was alsoproduced at lower plant densities and in wider row spacing [62].Moreover, P. anisum should be sown in the early spring, especially inApril, and seeds should be harvested at the waxy stage to obtain a higherTable 4Main components of aniseed oil insecticidal and acaricidal activity evaluated against immature and adult stages of arthropods of medical and veterinary interest.

A lack of water during stemelongation and umbel appearance decreased the EO production [64].Genetic variations among plants belonging to the same species(chemotypes) can result in the biosynthesis of different chemical con-stituents, leading to widely diverse EO types, in terms of composition andbioactivity [65,66]. In P. anisum, the enzyme S-adenosyl-L-methioni-ne:anol-O-methyltransferase (OMT) was demonstrated to directlyparticipate in the development of the chemotype containing trans-anet-hole. Moreover, several genes appeared to be involved in the differentbiosynthetic pathways of either trans-anethole and methyl chavicol [67].In general, according to the European Pharmacopoeia, a good aniseedchemotype is characterized by more than 90% trans-anethole and lessthan 1% methyl chavicol, because the latter was removed from the list offlavours in food stuffs, due to its harmful effect on animals. Notably, thepopulations with higher amounts of \u03b3-himachalene and lower levels ofmethyl chavicol are considered as sweeter accessions, which can beemployed in food products [68]. Additionally, significant differences inthe chemical profiles of aniseeds and roots EOs can be observed. In fact,trans-epoxypseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrate, \u03b2-bisabolene, and pre-geijerene were detected as the predominant components of the EO fromP. anisum roots [69].2.3. Applications and patentsAniseed EO plays a key role in food technology since it can be used asa flavouring agent in several products, including bread, cakes, candies,and beverages [70]. The highest levels of this product accepted by FDA(Food and Drugs Administration) are 750 ppm for alcoholic beverages,and 680 ppm for candies. Moreover, the EO, which is endowed with agreat antioxidant activity for the presence of high amounts of trans--anethole, can be employed as an additive [71] and to prevent fooddegradation. For this reason, it has an important economic impact due to11the current demand for biological foods [38,42,72,73]. Aniseed is in fact\u2018generally recognised as safe\u2019 (GRAS) in the USA, and as a natural sourceof feed flavoring by the Council of Europe [74]. In several Mediterraneancountries, traditional alcoholic beverages are produced with P. anisumthanks to the solubility of the EO and its main compounds in ethanol[75]. However, the development of non-alcoholic beverages with thisproduct remains difficult since its constituents are insoluble in water. Inthis respect, nanotechnology may represent a new alternative to preparenon-alcoholic beverages with significant amounts of EO and their com-ponents, by employing nanoparticles, nanocapsules, nanodispersions,and nanoemulsions [76]. Nanotechnology would also offer other ad-vantages to the food industry, through the development of safe productswith considerably low toxicity, improved bioavailability of functionalfoods, and activity of preservatives [77]. Notably, the encapsulation ofP. anisum EO was successfully performed into chitosan nanomatrix in theform of a nanoemulsion for the protection of stored rice againstfungal-mediated biodeterioration [65]. In addition, aniseed EO wasemployed in different concentrations into gelatin\u2013alginate coating fortreating zucchini fruit to be used as an active edible coating able toextend the shelf life of this product during storage [78].2.4. Toxicity and safetyThe investigation of the toxicity and safety of botanical products is ofcrucial importance for their development and exploitation in severalindustrial fields. In this regard, the toxicity of P. anisum EOwas evaluatedon different cell lines. For instance, it was tested on Hep G2 cells, whichare usually employed as in vitro alternatives to primary human hepato-cytes [79], leading to significant cytotoxicity at increasing concentra-tions. In detail, it caused a 34 and 58% cell viability reduction atconcentrations of 1.2 and 1.6% without an apoptotic/necrotic mecha-nism [60].

Itwas also assayed on brine shrimp larvae (Artemia salina L.), which areusually employed for cytotoxicity studies. In this regard, the study ofKhafagi et al. [82] reported a LC50 higher than 1000 \u03bcL/mL, while that ofMartins et al. [83] a LC50 of 293.8 \u03bcg/mL, classifying the EO as non-toxic.However, Ghosh et al. [84] reported IC50 values for P. anisum EO of2.86\u20133.06 \u03bcg/mL on brine shrimp larvae, and these results are in contrastwith the above-mentioned works.Regarding P. anisum EO safety, this product is listed as GRAS bythe FDA [85]. This classification relies on its low intake as flavouringagent (54 mg/kg body weight/day), metabolic detoxication in humans,low genotoxic or mutagenic potential, No Observed Adverse EffectLevel (NOAEL) of 120 mg/kg body weight/day, and its low impact on theincrease of hepatocellular tumours. According to the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMA) assessment report on P. anisum (EMA, 2012),the use of its EO is considered relatively safe. The British Herbal Phar-macopoeia [86] recommends a posology of 0.05\u20130.2 mL three times perday for the treatment of mild gastrointestinal complaints and as an ex-pectorant, while the EO dosage per day recommended by the GermanCommission E is 0.3 g (0.4 mL) [87]. However, since the EO containsmethyl chavicol and trans-anethole, for which a clear toxicological profilehas not been established, the use in sensitive groups such as children,pregnant, and breastfeeding women should be reduced or avoided (EMA,2012).143. Insecticidal and acaricidal activityAniseed oil and its principal constituents have been extensivelystudied for their toxicity against agricultural pests, stored-productpests, and vectors [Tables 3-10]. In general, the insecticidal andacaricidal effects of plant EOs, along with their primary constituents,are substantially influenced by their chemical composition [88\u201390].Depending on the dose, EOs can either attract or repel insects, or theymight serve as a toxin [91]. Because EOs are a complex mixture withnumerous constituents, their activity cannot be simplified to a singlemechanism of action. In insects, for example, P. anisum EO and itsprimary component, trans-anethole, can impair protein activity andinhibit key enzymes [92,93]. Trans-anethole can also act as acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor with systemic effects, neutralizing in-sect defence mechanisms in the midgut [94,95]. Monoterpenoids, ingeneral, act as AChE inhibitors, but only at large dosages, and theirinhibitory impact is reversible [91]. Several of aniseed oil main con-stituents (e.g., trans-anethole and limonene) can be extracted fromother plants, such as Illicium verum, Clausena austroindica, Croton ani-satum, Foeniculum vulgare, or Zanthoxylum limonella [96\u2013103]. In thefollowing paragraphs, we reviewed the studies that investigated theefficacy of P. anisum EO and its main constituents against veterinary,medical, stored product, and agricultural pests [Tables 3\u20138]. In addi-tion, assays using P. anisum EO-based micro- and nano-emulsions havebeen reported as well as possible side-effects of aniseed EO and itsmajor compounds on non-target species [Tables 9 and 10].Table 6Main components of aniseed oil insecticidal and acaricidal activity evaluated against immature and adult stages of stored product pests.

Arthropods of medical and veterinary interestA number of arthropods play a crucial role in the transmission of par-asites and pathogens from a vertebrate species to another, includinghumans, livestock, pets, and wildlife [104]. Vector-disease arthropods,especially mosquitoes, have been one of the primary focus of studies on theinsecticidal effects of aniseed oil and its major compounds (Tables 3 and4). P. anisum EO has been tested on different mosquito species (Diptera:Culicidae), which represent a major treat to millions of people globallysince they act as vectors of many diseases such as malaria, Zika, chi-kungunya, dengue, and yellow fever [105\u2013108]. Research is mainlyfocused on the insecticidal activity on mosquito larval stages since larvalmanagement is a critical part of a successful mosquito control program[109]. So far, all the experiments conducted on mosquito larvae involvingEOs followed the standard procedures established by WHO (1996), withslight modifications. Aniseed oil was very effective against 4th instarlarvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Aedes aegypti L. and Anopheles stephensiListon, thoughA. aegypti andA. stephensi larvae weremore susceptible thanC. quinquefaciatus ones (LD95 \u00bc 115.7 \u0003 3.3 \u03bcg/mL, LD95 \u00bc 115.7 \u0003 2.6\u03bcg/mL, LD95 \u00bc 149.7 \u0003 1.3 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) [110]. Even at lowconcentration, P. anisum EO exerts a relevant toxic effect on A. aegypti 3rdinstar larvae (LC90 \u00bc 0.043 ppm after 24 h) [111], and it has been provedto have an ovideterrent effect on females and to cause morphological ab-errations at pupal stage [112]. According to Benelli et al. [46], aniseed oilhad LC90 values of less than 100 ppm against C. quinquefasciatus 3rd instarlarvae, which is typically sufficient for developing botanical larvicides[113]. In addition, the mosquitocidal activity of aniseed oil andtrans-anethole on mosquito larvae can be enhanced by combing P. anisumEO with Trachyspermum ammi (L.) Sprague and Smyrnium olusatrum L.(Apiaceae) EOs [88]. Moreover, trans-anethole was able to create a syn-ergistic effect with other compounds (e.g., \u03b3-terpinene, eugenol, \u03b1-pinene,and carvacol) against C. quinquefasciatus larvae [113\u2013115] (Table 4).trans-Anethole was also highly effective toward Blattella germanica L.(Blattodea: Blattellidae) in contact toxicity assays [116] and against theWest Nile vector Culex pipiens L. [117].153.2. Stored product pestsIn commodities, aniseed oil showed high effectiveness against manyColeoptera species, making it a promising candidate to protect storedgrain within integrated pest management (IPM) programmes (Table 5).The insecticidal activity of aniseed oil was mainly determined via fumi-gation assays, followed by contact and topical assays [118]. However, theeffectiveness of the EO is closely linked to the stage of development of thepest on which it is tested. In general, for stored product pests, eggs, andpupae represent a major challenge since they may be less affected bychemicals than the active stages [119]. For instance, eggs of Triboliumconfusum du Val (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) are more tolerant toP. anisum EO than the adults [120,121]. However, in fumigant experi-ments with trans-anethole, the results were diametrically opposed, withthe eggs of T. confusum being more sensitive than adults [122].Recent studies not only investigated P. anisum EO and trans-anetholetoxic effect but also observed their action at an enzymatic level. Forinstance, trans-anethole was responsible for the decline of AChE activityin Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (LC50 \u00bc 5.02 mg/Lair, after 24 h) [123], for the interaction with the detoxicant system ofTribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [92,95] and anincreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), andperoxidase (POX) in Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae),enzymes that play a pivotal role in the elimination of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) products in cells [124].3.3. Agricultural pestsThe efficacy of P. anisum EO was evaluated on several species of agri-cultural interest (Tables 7 and 8). On adults of the green peach aphid,Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), P. anisum EO showedpromising results in acute toxicity assays when tested by contact (spraying)[46], while M. persicae nymphs were more resistant compared to nymphsof Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in fumigation assays[125]. Indeed, the lowest dose (i.e., 0.25 \u03bcL/L of air) caused the 87.5% ofTable 7P. anisum EO activity evaluated against immature and adult stages of agricultural pests.

Agriculture Communications 1 (2023) 100003mortality on A. pisum, but no mortality was observed forM. persicae [125].A possible explanation for this discrepancy lies in the wide host-range ofM. persicae. Indeed, generalist phytophagous insects that feed on a widevariety of plants have been discovered to have higher amounts of cyto-chrome P450 monooxygenase activity in their gut, which allows them todetoxify plant defensive compounds more efficiently [126]. As in the caseof stored product pests, studies have been conducted for some agriculturalpests to assess the effect of EOs at a physiological level. Aniseed oil at 40\u03bcL/L could fully control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticaeC.L. Koch (Trombidiformes), causing 96% ofmortality after 72 h [127] andaffecting the functioning of AChE and protease. Investigating the neuro-toxic effect of trans-anethole on Hypantria cunea (Drury) larvae (Lepidop-tera: Arctiidae), Pour et al. [128] noted that this compound stronglysuppressed the AChE activity, exhibiting neurotoxic effects. Lastly,trans-anethole exhibits a synergistic effect when used in combination withthymol and \u03b1-terpineol against moths of agricultural interest, such asSpodoptera litura (Fabricius), Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval), Helicoverpaarmigera (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chilo partellus (C. Swin-hoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) [129\u2013131].173.4. Micro- and nano-emulsionsSome of the limitations to the use of EO as biopesticides are theirlow chemical stability, limited persistence in the environment, and thepoor hydrophilicity [92,132]. A good strategy to overcome thesedrawbacks is represented by the development of micro- (MEs) andnanoemulsion (NEs) EO-based formulations [92,132]. AniseedEO-based nanotechnologies proved to be effective on different pestspecies and developmental stages, even at low concentrations,compared to conventional EO formulations. For instance, in a studycarried out by Draz et al. [133], aniseed NE formulations were signif-icantly more toxic (1.50 and 1.41 times) against T. castaneum andS. oryzae than the conventional EO, without affecting the wheatgermination rate. Corn derived zein-based nanocapsules loaded withaniseed EO have been successfully tested against 3rd instar larvae ofC. quinquefasciatus, showing to be effective at lower doses than aniseedEO alone (P. anisum EO: LC50 \u00bc 25.9 \u03bcL/L and LC90 \u00bc 31.9 \u03bcL/L;P. anisum EO microemulsion: LC50 \u00bc 2.39 \u03bcL/L and LC90 \u00bc 4.13 \u03bcL/L)[134].Table 8Main components of aniseed oil insecticidal and acaricidal activity evaluated against immature and adult stages of agricultural pests.

Sometimes, nanoformulations may not be better interms of increased toxicity but, due to their chemical\u2013physical properties,they may enhance other effects, like repellence and deterrence [134].Olives treated with aniseed NE at 7.5% showed a significant reduction inoviposition by the olive fly Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Teph-ritidae), although the formulation did not exert a relevant contact18toxicity [138]. In trials conducted on 2nd instar larvae of Leptinotarsadecemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Skuhrovec et al. [139]found that conventional aniseed EO is slightly more efficient against thisbeetle compared to NE formulations when applied topically, by contactor orally, but the NE formulation exhibits more than 20 times thepersistency and almost twice the antifeedant activity of the conventionalEO.As for classical EO formulations, NEs may exhibit variable effectsdepending on the developmental stage on which they are tested. Kaval-lieratos et al. [132] showed that aniseed EO-based NE at 4%w/w has lowmortality rate on the adults of T. castaneum and T. confusum (30.1% and13.3% at 1000 ppm after 7 days of exposure, respectively) while exertinga moderate to strong effect on their larval stages (mortality of 81.4% afterTable 9Micro- and nano-emulsion of aniseed oil and its major component toward medical, veterinary, stored product and agricultural pests.

Against particularly resistant pests, EO-based nanoformulationsmay be useful to overcome the limited efficacy of classical natural orsynthetic insecticides. Aniseed and ajwain, T. ammi, NE formulationsshowed low to moderate mortality when tested on adults of Tenebriomolitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) separately, but a stronger effectemerged when combined in a 3% w/w P. anisum \u00fe 3% w/w T. amminanoemulsion, indicating that certain combinations of EOs in NEs mayexhibit additive effects on certain species or developmental stages [132].Similar results have been obtained by Pavela et al. [56], testing highlystable MEs loaded with P. anisum EO in combination with two other EOsextracted from Apiaceae, i.e., T. ammi and Crithmum maritimum L. All thetested MEs caused acute toxicity to C. quinquefasciatus 3rd instar larvae(LC50 values ranging 1.45\u20134.01 mL/L) and a significant synergistic effectemerged in MEs loaded with P. anisum and T. ammi EOs [56]. In bothcases, a possible explanationmay be related to the combined action of thetwomajor compounds in themixture, i.e., trans-anethole (from P. anisum)and thymol (from T. ammi), the first one acting by neutralizing thedetoxification system of the insect (cytochrome P450,glutathione-S-transferases and esterases) and second one being able toinhibit the acetylcholinesterase and interact with octopamine receptorsmodulating GABA channels [56,88,94,124,140].3.5. Effects of aniseed EO on non-target speciesTable 7 summarizes the current knowledge about the toxicity ofaniseed EOs and their main chemical constituents against different non-target vertebrate and invertebrate species. The available data depict alimited though complex scenario: even though studies investigating the20insecticidal and acaricidal potential of EOs became more and morewidespread, most of them tested the efficacy of a single or more EOs onone or more target organisms, forgetting to extend effect assessments tonon-target organisms as well, a critical point in the procedure for theauthorisation of a biopesticide [141\u2013143].In the case of P. anisum, Pavela [114] observed that both the EO andits main compound, trans-anethole, were toxic for Daphnia magna Straus(Cladocera: Daphniidae) and negatively influenced its fertility at highconcentrations (35\u201350 \u03bcL/mL) and long exposure (48 h), but these effectswere extremely reduced at lower concentrations (20 \u03bcL/mL) and shortexposures (6 h). Similarly, S\u0001anchez-G\u0001omez et al. [134] found thatP. anisum EO-loaded nanocapsules had a negative impact on D. magnaadults after a 48-h exposure but argued that this effect significantlydecreased with exposures shorter than 24 h. Testing aniseed EO in lab-oratory assays, Benelli et al. [46] found scarce toxicity on 3rd instarlarvae of the multi-coloured Asian ladybug Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a useful predator for the control of aphidpopulations (maximummortality 16.3% at 5.5 mL/L), while no mortalitywas observed on adults. However, a particular attention must be paid tohow these formulations are used, as high doses and long exposure mayhave sub-lethal effects, such as reduced fertility or behavioural modifi-cations, in non-target organisms [131,144]. For instance, aniseed EO hasbeen shown to have low toxicity (i.e., high LCs) on Nesidiocoris tenuis(Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), a voracious predatory mirid largelyemployed in the biological control of pests in the Mediterranean area[145], even if higher concentrations of the oil may result in decrease ofthe insect's fertility and orientation ability [144].

Conclusion and future challengesDue to the negative effects of massive pesticide use on agro-ecosystembiodiversity and human health [147], as well as the withdrawal ofseveral recently revealed harmful products, the use of alternativeplant-based pesticides, such as EOs, should be encouraged. In thisperspective, P. anisum EO proved its efficacy against many arthropods byexerting neurotoxic effects, via GABA receptors, octopamine synapses,and the inhibition of AChE [92]. One of the most promising areas ofapplication of P. anisum EO is against arthropods of medical and veteri-nary importance, where it was successfully tested against several mos-quito species [46,105,110,112\u2013115]. At low doses and short time ofexposure, either the EO or the nanoformulations showed low toxicitytoward aquatic non-target species, while maintaining their effectivenesstoward vector larval stages [114,134]. In addition, dilution in water mayfacilitate the delivery of the substance to target organisms [105\u2013110,112\u2013115]. However, to date, most studies concerning EOs, including21P. anisum, are based on standardized laboratory bioassays, while fieldstudies are still uncommon. The possibility of discrepant results betweenlaboratory assays and field tests must be considered. There are stillseveral limits to be overcome in the application of EO-based bio-insecticides in IPM programs [91,94]. Further studies are needed tocarefully evaluate the effects of EOs on organisms according to theirdevelopmental stage or genetic strain, as well as their toxic or sublethaleffects on non-target species and the post-application impacts.Because of its use in food, beverages, cosmetics, and fragrances,aniseed cultivation all over the world, particularly in the Mediterraneanand Western Asian countries, ensures the plant biomass required toextract the EO and its use in the agrochemical industry even withoutfurther crop system implementation. Its low cost (1 kg of EO costs 7\u201350euro/kg depending on geographic origin and growth system) is anotheradvantage for using this EO to make biopesticides [8,148]. It is essentialto conduct additional research on enhancing the intensification offarming technology to increase yields. A high biological yield can beachieved by a proper agronomic practice and a profitable selection va-riety or different stages of plant maturity [149,150], or by changing theEOs isolation technology [151]. Furthermore, the constancy of theaniseed chemical profile documented in the literature, resulting in anE. Spinozzi et al. Agriculture Communications 1 (2023) 100003almost 'monocomponent' EO, eliminates the possibility of insecticidalefficacy fluctuation. Botanical compound-based micro- and/ornano-systems may represent a stumbling block in pest managementprograms. The encapsulation of active compounds can partially addresssome of the issues in EO application, such as thermolability and pho-tolability, increasing their overall efficiency. Among available nano-systems, MEs and NEs are the most suited for EOs given their highlipophilicity [152]. Moreover, through the creation of binary or tertiarymixtures of different EOs, micro- and nanocapsules can allow the arise ofsynergic effects related to a conjugate action of their major constituent,although some of the mechanisms underlying these interactions remainto be clarified. Lastly, a cost reduction of the overall process should bepursued.Declaration of interestsThe authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influencethe work reported in this paper.
