High bloodpressure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in healthcare settings, is linkedto the risk of cardiovascular illnesses and many other serious health issues thatcan develop from it. This review provides background regarding hypertension,including introductory concepts, risk factors, and treatment approaches.Hypertension may not be effectively treated with the use of diuretics, ACEinhibitors, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, directvasodilators, renin inhibitors, etc. These drugs\u2019 side effects include intolerance,weakened disease control, and improper therapy management. Therefore, anapproach for extracting new therapeutic chemicals from medicinal plants isreceiving attention today. As a result, this article provides a list of 85 plant speciesfrom 40 families, compiling data on ethnobotanical claims, plant parts used tomake extracts, different types of extracts and study animals, nutracuticals\u2019intended use, the antihypertensive effect of the extracts, their mode of action,clinical trials, toxicity profile, etc. It also mentions 55 specific chemicalcompounds that have shown potential to lower blood pressure in lab tests andlive subjects, along with their dosage and how they work, based on onlinesearches of published studies from different sources. Researchers looking intoand developing new anti-hypertensive therapies to treat hypertension wouldbenefit from our current work.

They\u2019re the leading cause of illness and death (1). Forexample, in Taiwan, CVDs are the second-most common cause of death (2). The termCVD refers to disorders of the heart and blood vessels. The most common typesTYPE ReviewPUBLISHED 05 September 2025DOI 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 01 frontiersin.orginclude hypertension (HTN), atherosclerosis (AS), coronary heartdisease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), peripheralvascular disease (PVD), heart failure (HF), cardiac arrhythmia(CA), thrombosis, and dyslipidemia (DL) (1).HTN is the primary cause of cardiovascular (CV) and kidneydiseases, but diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, and DL are alsosignificant risk factors (3). DL involves abnormal levels ofcholesterol (high total cholesterol (TC) and low-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) but low high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDLC)) and abnormalities in different lipoproteinparticles, which can increase the risk of HTN and heartattacks (HAs). Conditions like nephrotic syndrome (NS),hypothyroidism, obesity, and DM can lead to DL (1).Metabolic syndrome (MS), characterized by a cluster of conditionslike impaired glucose tolerance (GT), DL, obesity, and HTN, is a majorrisk factor for CVDs. Central obesity, which is particularly dangerous,can lead to insulin resistance (IR), pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes(T2DM), DL, high blood pressure (BP), AS, increased blood clotting,and inflammation. Hypercholesterolemia (HC) contributes to AS, acondition where cholesterol buildup in artery walls can lead todiseases like CHD, ischemic CBVD, and PVD (4). LDLC isparticularly linked to AS and CHD. Both high BP and highcholesterol increase the risk of AS, a complex inflammatorycondition that damages artery walls (5).High BP, also referred to as arterial HTN, is a chronic andprogressive condition that affects people across the globe,regardless of their background (6\u20138). It is characterized by apersistent rise in arterial BP, leading to serious health problemssuch as CHD, stroke, sudden cardiac death, congestive heartfailure (CHF), renal insufficiency (RI), and dissecting aorticaneurysm (9, 10). HTN is typically diagnosed when arterial BPconsistently measures at or above 140 mmHg systolic and/or90 mmHg diastolic on two or more occasions, averaged over twoseparate visits that include both in-office and out-of-officereadings (11, 12). If high BP is recorded three times within amonth, HTN is diagnosed (13). Many people with HTN may beunaware of their condition because it often presents no earlysymptoms, earning it the nickname \u201cthe silent killer\u201d (14). Thisis particularly true for mild-to-moderate primary HTN, whichcan remain symptomless for years. HTN significantly increasesmorbidity and mortality rates among adults and imposes aconsiderable financial burden on healthcare systems (11). It isgenerally classified into two types: primary/idiopathic/essentialHTN, which accounts for 90%\u201395% of cases, and secondaryHTN, which is characterised by elevated systemic BP due toidentifiable causes. While essential HTN cannot be cured, it canbe managed (4, 12).HTN is becoming more common worldwide. This is due tofactors like population growth, aging populations, and unhealthylifestyles (9, 14, 15). Around 1.28 billion people between the agesof 30 and 79 have HTN, and two-thirds of them live in low- andmiddle-income countries (16). HTN contributes to a significantnumber of deaths worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (8, 12). The prevalence of HTN varies byregion. High-income countries have lower rates of HTNcompared to low-income countries (9). In Africa, the prevalenceof HTN is high, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (18). Manypeople in these regions are unaware of their HTN and don\u2019treceive treatment (Rx). HTN is a major cause of death in Africa,particularly among adults. The number of deaths related to HTNhas increased significantly in recent decades (6, 12). It isprevalent in Ethiopia, though the exact prevalence variesdepending on the study (4, 12). Some studies suggest that up to30% of the population may have HTN (19, 20). HTN hasbecome a major public health concern in Ethiopia, contributingto a significant number of deaths from CVDs and strokes (21).The increasing prevalence of HTN is linked to factors likesedentary lifestyles, smoking and alcohol consumption,employment in manufacturing industries, increased stress,unhealthy diets, and rising life expectancy (12).Various factors can increase the risk of developing HTN. Sincethe exact causes of primary HTN are unknown, the term \u201criskfactors\u201d is considered appropriate. These risk factors are classifiedinto modifiable ones (such as a high body mass index (BMI) orobesity, sedentary lifestyle, stress, high salt and/or fat intake,deficiencies in micronutrients like calcium (Ca) and potassium(K), excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking) and non-modifiable ones (including genetic factors, age, sex, and race) (4, 22).Research in Ethiopia has identified factors such as residence,khat chewing, limited consumption of fruits and vegetables, andphysical inactivity as significant contributors to HTN. Thelifestyle of the Ethiopian population has evolved in recent yearsdue to urbanization and demographic changes, possibly leadingto a rise in HTN prevalence (23). Globally, alcohol consumptionis widespread, but its misuse poses public health concerns.Numerous studies have shown that long-term excessive drinkingoften leads to CV damage and physiological dysfunction, withchronic alcohol use raising BP and contributing to HTN.Excessive salt consumption is also a global issue, linked byseveral epidemiological studies to elevated BP and an increasedrisk of HTN, which can eventually lead to heart, liver, andkidney problems. Prolonged alcohol and salt consumption canhave detrimental effects on these organs, as well as increaseoxidative stress (OS) and DL associated with AS, which are riskfactors for HTN (9).Maintaining normal BP is a complex physiological process thatrelies on the coordinated function of several control systems,including the cardiovascular, renal, neurological, endocrine, andlocal tissue systems. It\u2019s widely recognized that thesehemodynamics are closely linked to BP regulation. Arterial BP ispositively correlated with cardiac output (CO) and peripheralvascular resistance (PVR). CO is directly influenced by heart rate(HR) and stroke volume (SV) (24). HR is determined by the rateof action potentials generated by the heart\u2019s primary pacemakercells, with the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) increasing HRand the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) decreasing it. Keyfactors that regulate left ventricular SV include preload (fillingpressure or venous return (VR) or end-diastolic volume (EDV)),afterload [pressure caused by arteriolar resistance (AR)], HR, andmyocardial contractility (MC). PVR is mainly determined by thediameter of arterioles, which in turn is controlled by theconstriction of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) aroundNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 02 frontiersin.orgthem. Vasodilator and vasoconstrictor factors simultaneouslyinfluence VSMCs within any given tissue. As a result, normal BPis maintained through the interplay of these interconnectedsystems (25).Ethiopia has a long history of using herbal therapy; numeroustraditional cultures employ medicinal herbs to treat a variety ofdiseases, including HTN. Examining these plants\u2019 traditionalapplications, methods of preparation, and cultural significance isnecessary to comprehend their ethnopharmacology. Thepreservation of traditional Rx approaches and their integrationinto contemporary healthcare systems both greatly benefit fromthis information. Understanding the pathophysiology of HTNfacilitates the identification of specific factors that influence diseasedevelopment. It also clarifies the approaches by which traditionalmedicine handles HTN. Ethiopian traditional healers are well-versed in the uses and benefits of medicinal plants. By tracingtheir practices and Rxs for HTN, we can learn more about theseculturally and traditionally based alternative healthcarephilosophies. This viewpoint is essential for bridging the gapbetween traditional healing methods and Western medicine.Scientific support for the safety and effectiveness of medicinalplants (MPs) used to treat HTN is provided by theirpharmacological effects. Showing the active ingredients causingtheir therapeutic effects may result in the development of novelmedicines or dietary supplements for the Rx of HTN. In additionto their therapeutic uses, several of the MPs used in Ethiopia arealso sources of nutraceuticals, which are bioactive substances withbeneficial health benefits. Exploring these plants\u2019 nutritional andfunctional properties highlights the significance of diet in theprevention and Rx of chronic diseases including HTN.Information on the bioactive components and modes of actionof MPs can be gleaned from their chemical makeup. This view iscrucial for discovering possible drug interactions or negativeeffects, standardizing herbal formulations, and guaranteeing theirquality and consistency. Encouraging their sustainable use,promoting their therapeutic potential, and incorporating them intoconventional healthcare practices are all dependent upon acomprehensive review of the MPs used in Ethiopia to controlHTN from a variety of angles, including ethnopharmacology,ethnomedicine, pharmacology, nutraceuticals, and phytochemistry.This is necessary to address the increasing prevalence of HTN.2 Current options in treatinghypertensionRx and management approaches for HTN differ greatlybetween countries. Natural resources were utilized in Africa fortherapeutic reasons (6). Two well-established practices forlowering BP are lifestyle changes and prescription medications.Device-based management is growing in acceptance, but it hasn\u2019tbeen proven to be a trustworthy Rx alternative (24, 26, 27).Unless there is a special indication, monotherapies (single-drugRx) are often advised as the first line of Rx for HTN. The use ofa second medicine, if necessary, or switching to a different drugare the next steps after monotherapy in an effort to determinethe best therapy for each patient. However, in the USA, theamount of anti-hypertensive medication to be given to drug-naive individuals depends on how much their BP is elevated.Two-drug Rx, either as a single tablet combination or twoseparate drugs, should be started in individuals whose BP ismore than 20/10 mmHg over the goal of therapy (28). With theargument that BP is a multi-regulated variable dependent onseveral compensatory pathways, combination Rx (acting inmultiple mechanisms) usage is now encouraged in the EuropeanUnion for the majority of patients (26). This action helps tospeed up the early management of BP and helps to maintainproper long-term BP control.Different drugs are used to treat HTN. Diuretics are essentialdrugs for HTN-Rx. While loop diuretics (high-ceiling diuretics)such as furosemide inhibit the Na+/K+/Cl\u2212 co-transporter in theascending loop of Henle, potassium-sparing diuretics (acting inthe collecting tubule) such as spironolactone correct K+ lossduring the Rx with thiazide and loop diuretics. Na+ and Cl\u2212reabsorption is hindered in the kidney\u2019s distal tubules by thiazidediuretics like hydrochlorothiazide. The class of drugs known asdiuretics also includes osmotic diuretics and carbonic anhydraseinhibitors (CAIs) (4, 24, 29, 30).Another class of anti-HTN drugs is angiotensin-covertingenzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), which include enalapril andcaptopril. In addition to inhibiting Ang-II production, ACEIsalso dilate blood vessels and lower BP by inhibiting the kininase2 enzymes and reducing bradykinin (BK) degradation.Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) like losartan and valsartanhave a mostly similar action to ACEI; nevertheless, ACEIs onlypartially prevent the production of ang-II. ARBs can inhibit theactions of Ang-II on the AT1-receptor, whether it is produced byACE or another enzyme such as cardiac chymase (4, 24, 31).Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are divided into two groups:dihydropyridines (such as nifedipine and amlodipine), whichproduce excellent BP control by directly relaxing the smoothmuscles (SMs) surrounding arteries, and non-dihydropyridines(such as verapamil and diltiazem), which lower BP bysimultaneously inducing vasodilation and reducing MC. CCBsprevent the passage of extracellular Ca2+ through ion-specificchannels. The L-type channels in humans are inhibited by theCCBs that are now on the market, despite the fact that severalvarieties of these channels have been discovered. CCBs causenatriuresis by raising glomerular filtration pressure, dilating afferentarterioles, and increasing renal blood flow in the kidney (4, 24).Beta-blockers (BBs) are among the drugs that prevent theeffects of endogenous catecholamine on \u03b2-adrenergic receptors.By inhibiting \u03b2-receptors in the brainstem and in peripheraltissues, including the heart, BBs improve HTN and decrease SNSactivity. These drugs work well on young people and whitepeople. BBs are divided into first, second, and third generationsbecause of differences in their selectivity for \u03b21/\u03b22-adrenergicreceptors and vasodilatory effects. Miscellaneous agents comprisealpha-1 blockers (prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin) that block\u03b11-adrenergic receptors, thereby inhibiting vasoconstrictioninduced by catecholamines; centrally acting \u03b12-agonists(methyldopa and clonidine) that stimulate \u03b12-receptors at theNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 03 frontiersin.orgvasomotor center; and direct vasodilators (such as hydralazine andminoxidil). Hydralazine (used to treat hypertensive crises) inhibitsinositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-induced release of Ca2+, whereasthe minoxidil mechanism is via modulating K+ ATP\u2012channels inthe VSMCs, allowing K+ efflux and SM relaxation. Additionally,as their vascular effects appear to be connected to the formationof nitric oxide (NO) gas as a consequence of their metabolicbreakdown, nitrates and sodium nitroprusside may be consideredas NO donors. The 2007 approval of the novel medicine aliskirenfunctions as a direct renin inhibitor (4, 24).Modern drugs significantly decrease CVD-related mortality.However, most of the population, particularly in third-worldnations, cannot afford the long-term use of these drugs.Additionally, some patients still have a long way to go beforereaching their goal BP and decreasing CV problems. One of themajor contributing factors to poor response is thought to bemedication-related issues or polypharmacy, especially in olderindividuals and those with concomitant illnesses. Pooradherence and Rx failure may result from this (7, 24). Drugsmade from synthetic materials are pricey and can lead to theappearance of new diseases, among other adverse outcomes.Additionally, there is a decrease in patient compliance withtaking more than a single tablet daily. With this in mind, HTNpatients, particularly those living in rural regions, look foralternate methods, such as herbal Rxs, to treat their HTN andother conditions (1, 3).3 Significance of medicinal plants inmanaging hypertensionHerbal medicines are gaining increasing importance in the Rxof HTN due to their broad therapeutic benefits, high safety profile,natural compatibility with the human body, cultural acceptance,wide availability, and lower cost. For example, natural diureticsfrom plants are expected not to cause K-depletion since manyplants contain K along with other minerals such as Na, Mg, Ca,and zinc (Zn) (14, 15, 32). Beneficial plant-derived cations likeK, Mg, and Ca contribute to anti-HTN effects by promotingendothelial-dependent vasorelaxation through variousmechanisms, including CCB, reducing Na+ reabsorption,inhibiting Ang-II secretion, and stabilizing vascular cellmembranes (33).With the growing population, trends towards holistic health,and rising cost of living and chronic diseases, there is anincreasing demand for herbal medicines. Researchers are turningto natural resources for the Rx of HTN and other conditions(34). Natural ingredients have played a crucial role in thedevelopment of CV drugs. Ethiopia, with its rich ethnobotanicalknowledge and vast biodiversity, offers a unique opportunity toexplore the medicinal potential of plant-based compounds. Thecountry is home to around 6,500\u20137,000 species of higher plants,12% of which are endemic. Ethiopia is recognised as one of sixcountries worldwide where 60% of the plants are believed to benative and possess medicinal properties. Ethiopian MPs arereported to have significant hypotensive effects (7, 10, 24, 35).MPs represent the earliest form of healthcare known tohumanity and have been instrumental in the development ofmodern civilization. According to the World HealthOrganization (WHO), 80% of the global population continues torely on traditional or herbal remedies for their basic healthcareneeds. Today\u2019s pharmacopoeia includes 7,000 medicinalsubstances, which account for about 25% of all medications. TheWHO also notes that approximately 34% of plant-derived drugsdirectly align with their traditional uses in indigenous cultures(36, 37). Of the 252 medicines deemed essential by the WHO,11% are exclusively plant-based, while many others are syntheticdrugs derived from natural sources. Over 2,000 plants have beenidentified with therapeutic properties for treating HTN, offeringcardioprotective, cardioactive, cardiotonic, or circulatory-stimulating effects (38). For example, reserpine, an alkaloid fromthe root extract of Rauwolfia serpentina, is highly effective as afirst-line Rx for lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP). The anti-HTN effects of MPs are attributed to their tannins, galloylderivatives, flavonols, flavones, phenylpropanoids, proanthocyanidins,and flavonoid glucosides (39). In several African countries,particularly Ethiopia, up to 80% of the rural population relies onMPs for Rx. MPs have long played a crucial role in both healthcareand diet in global societies (10).Natural antioxidants found in plants are generally responsiblefor preventing or slowing the harmful effects of oxidative stress(OS), which is considered the root cause of aging and varioushuman diseases such as AS, stroke, HTN, DM, cancer, andneurological disorders (37). In certain HTN models, antioxidantsnot only help reduce elevated BP but also mitigate inflammation,fibrosis, sclerosis, and dysfunction of the kidneys, heart, andother organs. Numerous plant-derived enzymes and non-enzymatic secondary metabolites can scavenge reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), thereby protecting the body from oxidativedamage (10). Polyphenols and flavonoids have been shown topossess free radical-scavenging and renoprotective effects. Theycan be used as adjunctive Rx in hypertensive patients withimpaired renal function (40, 41).Polyphenols have vasorelaxing properties and promote NOproduction, leading to a reduction in BP (40). Flavonoids canenhance endothelial function (EF) and prevent plateletaggregation, thereby reducing the risk of CVD (42). Tannins,which are polyphenolic compounds, also possess vasorelaxanteffects, similar to acetylcholine (Ach), with most of their effectsbeing endothelium-dependent. Additional mechanisms for thevasorelaxant effects of polyphenols include the inhibition ofprotein kinase C (PKC), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases(PDEs), and/or reduced Ca2+ uptake (43). Terpenoids derivedfrom various plants have been shown to lower BP primarily byinhibiting L-type calcium channels (CCs) (44). Certain plantextracts have been found to inhibit angiotensin-convertingenzyme (ACE). The bioactive components (phenolic acids,alkaloids, polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, polysaccharides, andsterols) of these medicinal plants have demonstrated ACEIactivity (38). Similarly, soybean saponins have been shown tolower BP by inhibiting renin and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway (43). Flavonoids have beenNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 04 frontiersin.orgshown to reduce the production of aldosterone by the kidneys andantidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland (42). Alkaloidsexhibit effects similar to BB drugs (42).Research indicates that certain components in plants, suchas saponins, K, and phenolic compounds, can promotediuresis, saluresis, and natriuresis either individually or incombination by (a) disrupting the reabsorption of water andelectrolytes (Na+ and Cl\u2212) in the renal tubules or (b)inhibiting Na+/K+ -ATPase activity in the kidneys by directlybinding to the enzyme, impairing its function, or alteringmembrane fluidity. Some theories also suggest that thesecompounds may influence the interaction between membranephospholipids and Na+/K+ -ATPase pumps (45, 46).Flavonoids promote vasodilation in the afferent arterioles ofthe renal vasculature, which increases the glomerular filtrationrate (GFR), leading to greater water excretion and lower BP(46). Another mechanism by which flavonoids exert theirdiuretic effects involves interaction with adenosine A1-receptors. Plant alkaloids are also recognized for their diureticproperties, particularly those containing benzyl isoquinoline-type alkaloids (47). Saponins contribute to diuresis bypromoting the excretion of Na+ and other electrolytes alongwith water, which decreases plasma volume and, in turn, CO(42). Plant extracts and their metabolites can also lower HTNthrough their anti-inflammatory effects (48).Unlike DNA sequences, epigenetic modifications arepotentially reversible, making them attractive targets formodern or personalized medicine. By maintaining the balancebetween histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases/lysine deacetylases and preventing hypermethylation, CVD-causing factors such as OS, cell proliferation, andinflammation can be mitigated. Notably, research is advancingon the use of plants and plant-derived compounds to influencehistone structure. Although there are no reports from Ethiopia,Chinese traditional MPs have shown potential interactions withhuman enzymes that modify histones. Some of these medicinalcompounds may promote histone condensation, a process withsignificant implications for the pathology of various diseases,including CVDs. Hesperidin from citrus fruits and lycopenefrom tomatoes are known to inhibit methylation. Catechinsfrom tea, curcumin from turmeric, and coumaric acid fromcinnamon act as inhibitors of acetylation and methylation.Additionally, allyl sulfides found in garlic can inhibit histonedeacetylases. Recent findings suggest that a polyherbal blendmay regulate class I and II histone deacetylases. Tanshinone 1,a compound from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown toinhibit histone H3 acetylation. Rosmarinic acid alsoepigenetically influences peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptors (PPAR), which play a key role in CV physiology,including BP regulation. Recent research indicates that herbsand their components may play a crucial role in diseases andhealth benefits related to microRNA (miRNA). For example,grape extract has been shown to downregulate miRNAsassociated with inflammation, providing a positiveimmunomodulatory effect in individuals with HTN (49).Nutraceuticals have been gaining significant attention (50),particularly for their potential role in managing HTN throughthe regulation of OS. Antioxidants have been shown to mitigateHTN-related changes caused by OS, leading to numerous studiesfocused on improving this chronic condition through increasedintake of antioxidant-rich foods (51). Fruits, vegetables, andother plant-based foods high in phenolics, especially flavonoids,have been identified as offering substantial health benefits due totheir oxidative damage reduction properties. These benefits areattributed to their ability to bind metal ions, scavenge freeradicals, activate endogenous antioxidant enzymes, and inhibitoxidative chain reactions (52). In individuals with normal orstage-1 HTN, a diet rich in vegetables and fruits ensuressufficient intake of Mg and K, which has been shown tosignificantly lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3.1/2.1 mmHg (53). A diet high in K and an increase in serum K+levels, even within the physiological range, promoteendothelium-dependent vasodilation by hyperpolarization (HP)via activation of Na+ -pumps and opening of K+ -channels. TheHP is transmitted from the endothelium to VSMCs, leading to areduction in cytosolic Ca2+ and resulting in vasodilation. HighK intake may also reduce stroke risk by inhibiting VSMCproliferation, free radical production, and arterial thrombosis.Experimental evidence suggests that K can decrease macrophageadhesion to the vascular wall, which is critical in thedevelopment of arterial lesions, endothelial OS, and theproduction of vascular eicosanoids (54).Peptides, phenolic compounds, and flavonoid-rich foods(edible plant materials) have been shown to lower BP and inhibitACE (38). Among the bioactive peptides, ACEI peptides areparticularly notable. To be effective, they must be stable in thegastrointestinal tract and capable of being delivered to thecardiovascular system (CVS) (31). Consuming phytochemicals\u2014particularly a diet rich in methyl donors\u2014can help regulate DNAhypomethylation levels and reduce CVD risk factors. Folate playsa key role in DNA synthesis and regulation as a methyl donor.In fact, a diet low in folate during pregnancy can negativelyimpact the health of the unborn child, leading to an obesephenotype and increasing the risk of HTN in adulthood.Conversely, a diet high in methyl donors during pregnancy canprotect against obesity in offspring (49).This review seeks to connect the pathogenesis of HTN and thepharmacology of antihypertensive drugs with the ethnomedicinalpractices, potential mechanisms of action, and clinical relevanceof Ethiopian MPs used in HTN Rx. It provides ethnobotanicalinformation on the MPs utilized in Ethiopia for managing HTN.The review also presents in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivoexperimental evidence supporting the pharmacologicaleffectiveness of these MPs in reducing HTN in various animalmodels. Along with preclinical research, it discusses clinicalstudies and anti-HTN compounds isolated from theseethnobotanically recognized plants. Additionally, the paperhighlights the unexplored areas and opportunities for developinga strong foundation for current alternatives and future researchaimed at discovering new plant-based anti-HTN drugs.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 05 frontiersin.org4 Sources of data and searchmethodologiesEthnobotanical information about the claimed MPs found inEthiopia and their extracts, metabolites, and active compounds, aswell as preclinical and clinical efficacy studies done anywhere, wassearched and downloaded from global databases such as PubMed,Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO, ResearchGate, Google, GoogleScholar, ScienceDirect, and AJOL.

This number is higher thanreports from Iran (22 species), the Tenggerese society (41species), and Ghana (39 species) (111\u2013113). The higher numberof documented species may reflect the strong reliance ofEthiopians on traditional medicine (TM), likely due to the highcost of modern drugs, limited availability and accessibility ofmodern healthcare services, and the cultural acceptance of herbalremedies (114). Conversely, the number is lower than reportsfrom Guinea (97 species), Morocco (104 species), and SouthAfrica (117 species) (115\u2013117), which could suggest either a lackof extensive research in Ethiopia or differences in researchmethodologies. As shown in Table 1, the most commonlyreported plant species used to manage HTN in Ethiopia areThymus schimperi (11.7%), Rumex abyssinicus (9.0%), Moringastenopetala (8.1%), Lupinus albus (4.5%), Ajuga integrifolia(3.6%), and Calpurnea aurea (3.6%). The frequent citation ofspecific plant species or families may indicate a higher potentialfor bioactive compounds, making them priority candidates forfuture pharmacological study (118).The documented MPs were categorized into 40 families, withthe most prevalent being Lamiaceae (23.72%), Fabaceae (10.17%),Asteraceae (10.17%), Rutaceae (8.47%), and Cucurbitaceae(6.78%). Amaryllidaceae, Apiaceae, and Rosaceae eachcontributed 3 species (5.08%) (Figure 1). These findings areconsistent with studies from Morocco, where most HTN-treatingplants belong to the Lamiaceae (18 species), Asteraceae (10species), Apiaceae (8 species), Fabaceae (4 species), andSolanaceae (3 species) families (116). Similarly, in Ghana, manyof the plants used for HTN Rx are from the Fabaceae,Cucurbitaceae, and Lamiaceae families (113). In South Africa andGuinea, Asteraceae and Fabaceae are the most commonlyrepresented families (115, 117). In Ethiopia, around 23 familiesare represented by a single species effective against HTN. TheFabaceae, Asteraceae, and Solanaceae families are particularlyprominent in Ethiopian flora (119). The dominance of theLamiaceae (120), Asteraceae (121, 122), Fabaceae (120, 121), andRutaceae (118, 123) families has also been noted in surveys ofMPs used for various ailments in Ethiopia. This data highlightsthe cultural and medicinal significance of the Lamiaceae,Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rutaceae families in managing HTN inEthiopia (123).5.1.2 Parts of medical plants used and preparationconditionsThe use of plant parts and their preparation methods areinfluenced by their availability and the knowledge of indigenouspeople (122). While various plant parts are used for remedypreparation, leaves were the most commonly used (42.72%),followed by roots (18.45%), fruits (14.56%), seeds (12.62%), andstems (3.88%), as shown in Figure 2. These findings align withother studies that identified leaves as the most frequently usedpart for treating HTN (113, 115, 116, 124). This pattern issimilar to traditional wound Rx practices in Ethiopia, whereleaves are the most commonly used, followed by roots and fruits.Other ethnomedicinal studies in Ethiopia have similarly reportedthat leaves are the most frequently utilized plant parts, likely dueNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 06 frontiersin.orgto their greater availability, ease of preparation, and theeffectiveness of their phytoconstituents (125).Research indicates that TM practitioners in various Africancountries primarily use plant leaves. Leaves produce the majorityof plant secondary metabolites, making them a rich source ofchemically active compounds that are relatively easy to extract(118). Promoting the use of leaves for remedy preparation isrecommended as a more sustainable approach to accessing plantmaterials, as harvesting leaves allows the parent plant to continueits life functions, unlike root harvesting, which typically kills theTABLE 1 Frequently reported medicinal plant species used to control hypertension in Ethiopia.Plant species Citation no.

While plant roots are also rich in potent bioactivecompounds, their frequent use in herbal remedies can endangerthe survival of the plant species. To ensure the sustainable use ofMP resources, it is important to adopt proper harvestingtechniques and conservation strategies (118).In some instances, multiple parts of the same plant were usedeither separately or in combination. Remedies were prepared usingplant parts in dry, fresh, or both forms. Fresh plant parts, which arerich in bioactive metabolites, are often preferred for formulatingremedies in Ethiopia, as they can be quickly and convenientlyprepared into medicines using methods such as crushing,squeezing, maceration, infusion, and decoction (119). Most ofthese anti-hypertensive botanicals are used as monotherapies,although some involve combinations of multiple MPs. Ethiopianherbal remedies for treating HTN that involve mixtures of two ormore different MPs include Allium sativum with Allium porrum;Carica papaya with Ajuga integrifolia; Embelia schimperi withRuta chalepensis and Rumex abyssinicus; Mentha spicata withCarissa spinarum and Citrus aurantifolia; Moringa stenopetalawith Allium cepa and Capsicum annuum; and Rumex abyssinicuswith Allium sativum (Supplementary material 1).5.1.3 Techniques of community recipepreparations and additives usedTraditional healers follow various techniques and strictprocedures when preparing herbal therapies, even though theyrely on simple methods and tools. They do not require advancedprocessing methods or equipment, likely due to the absence ofprocessing instruments and formal education (120). Healers useeither a single method or a combination of techniques forpreparation. The most common methods for preparing anti-hypertensive herbal remedies include decoction (27.94%),squeezing (19.12%), crushing (17.65%), and pounding (16.18%),as shown in Figure 3. These methods are also commonly used inthe preparation of anti-malarial remedies in Ethiopia (121). Thepreference for chewing and crushing may be linked to the ease ofpreparation and the availability of local tools, such as stones.Similarly, decoction has been highlighted as the primarypreparation technique in studies conducted in Ghana (113),Guinea (115), Morocco (116), and Iran (124).MPs were prepared in various forms using different additivesand solvents. Among the solvents used, water was the mostcommon (45.10%), followed by tea (15.69%). Other solvents likealcohol (7.84%), coffee (5.88%), and milk (3.92%) were used lessfrequently. Various additives such as honey (13.73%) and sugar(7.84%) were incorporated into the preparations (Figure 4).Water and tea are popular solvents because many metabolitesdissolve easily in them, and high temperatures help to quicklyextract active components. Additives and solvents were mainlyused to enhance the effectiveness of the remedy and createfavorable healing conditions by either reducing toxicity orimproving the flavor of the Rx. This could be due to thesynergistic effects of combinations that contain multiplepharmacologically active substances, increasing the likelihood ofinteractions with a wide range of biological targets. Theseinteractions can influence the remedy\u2019s availability, absorption,distribution, bioactivity, enzyme activity, and selectivity (118).5.1.4 Route, frequency, duration, and doses ofadministrationAs shown in Table 2, the most common method ofadministering anti-hypertensive herbal remedies was oral intake,with drinking (65.52%), eating/chewing (24.14%), and, lessfrequently, intranasal administration (10.34%). This preferenceFIGURE 2Frequently used parts of medical plants to manage hypertension in Ethiopia.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 08 frontiersin.orgfor oral administration may be due to the simplicity of this method,the challenges of using other parenteral routes, and concerns aboutpotential side effects in the event of an overdose. This finding alignswith numerous studies on other diseases in Ethiopia (120).Similarly, in other African countries, oral administration is alsothe preferred method for managing HTN (113, 115). HTN is achronic and systemic condition, requiring precise delivery oftherapeutic compounds at the correct blood concentration. TheFIGURE 3Common preparation forms of traditional medicines for hypertension in Ethiopia.FIGURE 4Commonly employed solvents/additives in antihypertensive medical plants remedy in Ethiopia.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 09 frontiersin.orgoral route is non-invasive and convenient, allowing for relativelyrapid absorption and distribution of the active ingredients inherbal remedies, thus providing adequate therapeutic effects (98).Typically, herbal medicines are recommended to be taken once,twice, or three times daily for periods ranging from threeconsecutive days to six months. Some traditional healers advisepatients to take the remedy in the morning, at bedtime, or on anempty stomach before meals. Dosages are often expressed as aglass, a cup, or half a cup. It is well known that traditionalhealthcare systems often face challenges due to a lack ofprecision and standardization (118).Supplementary material 2 provides a detailed review of otherlocal and traditional uses of MPs used for treating HTN inEthiopia. Overall, many of the ethnobotanical studies werelocalized, lacking comprehensive nationwide surveys. In most ofthe survey, the frequency of administration and the dosage usedwere not reported. In some of the reported studies, methods ofpreparation and application are not mentioned. In some otherpublished papers that are not included here, the list of plantswith their corresponding indications, method of preparations,and other descriptions are not available in table format. Thisreduces the total number of species identified and reported.5.2 Pharmacological and nutraceuticalevidences of the reported medicinal plantsThe findings of preclinical studies are summarized in Tables 3\u20136,while the clinical investigation results are presented in Table 7. Out of85 Ethiopian MPs traditionally claimed to have anti-HTN properties,about 21 showed positive anti-HTN effects in in vivo, in vitro, or exvivo studies. Around 11 plants demonstrated anti-HTN benefitsboth in preclinical models and clinical studies. The secondarymetabolites (Table 8) and compounds (Table 9 and Figure 5)isolated from these plants also exhibited significant anti-HTNactivity in preclinical studies. Extracts, plant materials, and isolatedactive compounds from around eight plants were reported to havesubstantial anti-HTN effects in preclinical models. Approximatelyfive plants had robust scientific evidence of anti-HTN effects inhuman studies and animal, tissue, and in vitro assays. One plantshowed ex vivo bioactivity, demonstrated solely by its activecompound. In total, 46 Ethiopian MPs have confirmed anti-HTNactivity through various mechanisms and approaches. Theremaining 39 plants are yet to be explored by researchers.Although Catha edulis is traditionally considered an anti-HTNplant (57, 77) in Ethiopia (Supplementary material 1), severalstudies suggest that khat is more likely to raise BP than lower it(143\u2013147). These findings highlight the possibility that someherbs and plants might have effects contrary to their traditionaluses. Therefore, scientifically validating the medicinal claims ofsuch plants is crucial for ensuring patient safety.Herbal medicines help manage and reduce HTN throughvarious mechanisms, including antioxidant, antiinflammatory,antiproliferative, and antiapoptotic effects. They also stimulatethe endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/NO signalingpathway, decrease endothelial permeability, inhibit ACE activity,increase diuresis, regulate Ca2+ levels in VSMCs or myocardialcells, inhibit the expression or activity of contractile andstructural proteins, and open K+ ATP-channels. Natural plants orherbs can reduce inflammation in macrophages and monocytesby inhibiting the inducible NOS (iNOS)/NO signaling pathway,potentially through the activation of estrogen receptor andPPAR\u03b1-dependent signaling pathways (148). The mechanismsthrough which Ethiopian MPs (their extracts and activecompounds) control HTN are detailed in Tables 3\u20136, 8, 9.Acanthospermum hispidum (149) is recognized for its anti-HTN properties in TM in Ethiopia (55) and Brazil (150). It isalso used as a diuretic in Brazil (150), Benin (151), and SouthAmerica (152). A. hispidum exhibits both acute hypotensive andanti-HTN effects, likely through vasodilation by the activation ofprostaglandin (PG) (153) and NO/cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (cGMP) pathways. This action is linked to areduction in oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers (150).Research by Palozi et al. demonstrated that A. hispidum iseffective in inducing saluretic effects (153). The plant alsopossesses hepatoprotective and hypoglycemic properties, whichcan help manage comorbidities in hypertensive patients (149).Achyranthes aspera is a widely known MP used in varioustraditional and modern healthcare systems, including ayurvedic,allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, and home remedies (154).Traditionally, it has been used to manage HTN in Ethiopia (56) andIndia (154, 155), as well as to promote diuresis in India (154, 156).The plant\u2019s effectiveness in reducing BP could also be linked to itsconfirmed antioxidant (155, 160, 161), diuretic (157\u2013159),antiinflammatory (162), hypotensive, bradycardic (163), andantiproliferative properties. Its hepatoprotective, antiobesity,hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic effects may further support its rolein managing high BP (156).Ajuga remota is an herb native to East Africa. Species of theAjuga plant have been traditionally used as remedies for high BPin East and North Africa (61, 164). In traditional Chinesemedicine, Ajuga plants are documented for their diureticproperties. One mechanism through which A. remota exerts itsanti-HTN effects is its K-sparing diuretic action (164). Itsantioxidant activity may also contribute to its role in managingHTN (165). The plant\u2019s anti-diabetic properties further enhanceits suitability for treating high BP (166). It is generally acceptedthat plants within the same genus exhibit similar bioactivity andcontain comparable bioactive compounds. In line with this, A.bracteosa and A. iva, which belong to the same genus as A.remota, have shown anti-hypertensive effects (167\u2013169).Allium cepa, a fiber-rich herb believed to have originated inAfghanistan, Iran, and the former Soviet Union (170), istraditionally used to treat HTN in various countries, includingEthiopia (62, 63), Morocco (14), and Palestine (171), as well asTABLE 2 Common

Peru, the Philippines, Romania, Spain, Togo,and Turkey (172). In Cuban TM, it is used as a diuretic (173).The global use of this plant highlights its ethnopharmacologicalsignificance in managing HTN.A. cepa has shown diuretic effects in rats comparable tofurosemide, suggesting that it functions similarly to loop diuretics(32, 173). It also exhibited hypotensive and negative chronotropiceffects, with results similar to ACEIs and ramipril (174, 175).The quercetin-rich extract from A. cepa skin lowered arterial BPin hypertensive patients, indicating quercetin\u2019s cardioprotectiveproperties (176). In rats, A. cepa demonstrated an anti-HTNeffect by increasing NO levels through antioxidant activity,enhancing NOS activity (177\u2013179), and releasing NO fromS-nitroso-glutathione (180). The plant extracts may also increaseBK availability indirectly through ACEI, further boosting NOlevels and promoting endothelium-dependent vasodilation (181,182). The vasorelaxation effect was also linked to the inhibitionof Ca2+ influx in VSMCs (179). A. cepa bulb extract reducedvascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in rats,providing evidence of its anti-inflammatory properties (177). A.cepa\u2019s cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antiobesity, anti-HC,and anti-DM effects contribute to HTN management (170).However, boiling A. cepa is reported to diminish its anti-HTNactivity (179).Allium sativum is widely used around the world as both foodand medicine (182, 183). It is even mentioned in the Bible andhas been a traditional remedy in many countries (184). This herbis utilized in TM for its anti-HTN properties in countries such asEthiopia (57, 64, 65), Morocco (14), Palestine (171), Afghanistan,Albania, Algeria, Benin, Brazil, Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Germany,Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Jamaica, Kosovo,Macedonia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Martinique, Mauritius,Mexico, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines,Rodrigues, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania,Thailand, Togo, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the USA(172). This widespread use highlights its potential medicinalbenefits against HTN, underscoring the need for comprehensivepharmacological research, formulation of extracts, and itsapplication as an alternative medicine.A. sativum has been found to produce hypotensive effects alongwith negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, which suggest aBB-like action (183, 185). The BP-lowering effect of garlic mayalso be mediated through the NO pathway (186). Increasedurinary excretion of the stable end products of NO metabolism(nitrite/NO2\u2212 and nitrate/NO3\u2212) in garlic-fed rats indicates that itseffect is linked to the NOS activation and NO production (187).Garlic may exhibit anti-HTN properties through anti-inflammatory effects (177, 188). The combination of captoprilwith fresh garlic homogenate or its bioactive component, S-allylcysteine, has been shown to have synergistic anti-HTN andcardioprotective effects (189). Various A. sativum preparationshave demonstrated significant anti-DM effects in patients withHTN (15, 190, 191).The potential drawbacks of using fresh A. sativum (garlic)include the risk of causing indigestion and unpleasant odors,TABLE3ContinuedS.no.MedicinalplantsExtract/treatmenttype(s)Studyanimal/tissue/assayROAStudymodel(s)Dose(s)andresult(s)PossibleMOA(s)Ref.no.\u25aan-hexanefractionproducednotablerelaxationeffectsinconcentration-dependentmanner-CCBlikeactivity-Ca2+releasefromintracellularstoresAqueouscrudeextractNormotensiveSDRrats&itsisolatedaorta&isolatedguinea-pigrightatriaIVInvivo,Exvivo\u25aa10mg/kginducedafallinBPby46.9%\u25aa0.01\u20135mg/mldepressedPE-inducedcontractionofendotheliumcontainingaorta\u25aa0.1\u20131.0mg/mlrelaxedK+-inducedaortacontraction\u25aa0.1\u20135mg/mlcausedinhibitiononforceofatrialcontractionsindose-dependentmanner-M-receptorsactivation-Ca2+-channelsblockade(571)GingercrudeextractofrhizomePorcinecoronaryarteriesNAExvivo\u25aa1,3,10,30&100\u03bcg/mlincreasedrelaxationfrom27\u201399%inendothelium-intactartery-NOSsignalingpathway-Vasoprotectiveactivity(2)ROA,routeofadministration;MOA,mechanismofaction;PO,perOS(orally);NO,nitricoxide;cGMP,cyclicguanosinemonophosphate;2k1C,twokidneyoneclip;SBP,systolicbloodpressure;DBP,diastolicbloodpressure;MAP,meanarterialbloodpressure;HR,heartrate;PG,prostaglandin;SDR,Sprague-Dawleyrats;L-NAME,L-nitroargininemethylester;SHRSP,stroke-pronespontaneouslyhypertensiverat;HTN,hypertension;eNOS,endothelialnitricoxidesynthase;FIH,fructose-inducedhypertension;HPOIH,heatedoil-inducedHTN;VCAM-1,vascularcelladhesionmolecule-1;NA,notapplicable;IV,intravenous;IP,intraperitonial;NC,notclear;SHR,spontaneouslyhypertensiverats;RBCs,redbloodcells;H2S,hydrogensulfide;ADH,antidiuretichormone;BP,bloodpressure;DOCA,desoxycorticosteroneacetate;WKY,wistarkyotorats;cAMP,cyclicadenosinemonophosphate;PDEs,phosphodiestrases;CCB,calciumchannelblocking;COX,cyclooxygenase;VGCCs,voltage-gatedcalciumchannels;ET-1,endothelin-1;RAAS,renninangiotensinaldosteronesystem;EC50,50%effectiveconcentration;VDCCs,voltage-dependentcalciumchannels;PE,phenylephenephrine;KCl,potassiumchloride;EPI,epinephrine;IC50,50%inhibitoryconcentration;ECs,endothelialcells;VSCCs,voltage-sensitivecalciumchannels;ROCCs,receptor-operatedcalciumchannels;SNS,sympatheticnervoussystem;LDH,lactatedehydrogenase;RVH,renovascularhypertension;EDRF,endothelium-derivedrelaxingfactor;NaCl,sodiumchloride;NE,norepinephrine;5-HT,serotonin;1K1C,onekidneyoneclip.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 18 frontiersin.orgprimarily due to S-allyl\u029f-cysteine sulfoxide (alliin). Aged garlic isbelieved to offer superior antioxidant benefits compared to rawgarlic, particularly in reducing both physiological andpsychological stress. In studies involving spontaneouslyhypertensive rats (SHR) and human participants, aged garliceffectively reduced high BP. The effectiveness of processed garlicproducts may be attributed to their ability to enhance theantioxidant status in individuals with HTN (192). In patientswith treated but uncontrolled HTN, aged garlic has shown to bemore effective in lowering SBP, comparable to first-linemedications (193\u2013195). S-allylcysteine, a stable and activecompound in aged garlic, allows for standardized dosing. Agedgarlic is also safer than other garlic preparations, as it does notpose a risk of bleeding when used with blood-thinningmedications like warfarin. It is a safe and effective supplement totraditional anti-HTN Rxs for individuals with uncontrolledHTN (196).Allicin, which is derived from alliin\u2014the main component offresh, raw, and powdered A. sativum\u2014is unstable and easilyevaporates. Consuming excessive amounts of raw garlic, whichcontains allicin, can lead to intolerance, gastrointestinal issues,allergic reactions, and a decrease in red blood cell (RBC) count.Cooking destroys allicin. Garlic essential oil contains diallyldisulfide and diallyl trisulfide but lacks water-soluble allicin.Standardizing and comparing products is challenging becausemany commercially available A. sativum oil preparations containonly a small amount of garlic essential oil in a vegetable oilbase (197).A. sativum extracts not only reduce the force of heartcontractions (198) but also lower BP by inhibiting adenosinedeaminase (199). In a clinical trial, garlic components like alliin,allyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide significantly lowered BP.When garlic was combined with vitamins C and E, BP wasnoticeably reduced in human participants. At the cellular level,these garlic components doubled the production of NO byendothelial cells (ECs) compared to the control. When combinedwith antioxidant vitamins, the production of EC NO increasednearly threefold, resulting in a vasorelaxant effect (200\u2013202).Low-molecular-weight thiols, such as glutathione, which reactwith NO, have been proposed as potential NO-carrier moleculesin living organisms. Endogenous nitrosothiols, like S-nitroso-glutathione, may play a role in storing and transporting NO.Studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas and H2Sdonors like NaHS or Na2S can release NO from storednitrosothiols and biological membranes. Garlic has been found toprolong the relaxation caused by S-nitroso-glutathione andinhibit chloride channels in aortic rings contracted bynorepinephrine (NE) (203). Additionally, A. sativum reducedendothelin 1 (ET-1)-induced vasoconstriction and showed ACEIactivity, promoting vasorelaxation (181, 204, 205).TABLE 4 Antioxidant activity of medicinal plants claimed for treating hypertension in Ethiopia.S.no.MedicinalplantsExtract/treatment type(s) Result(s) Ref.no.1 Allium cepa 5% dried onion diet \u25aa Decreased TBARS in plasma & protect NO (178)Aqueous onion bulbs extract \u25aa 400 mg/kg reduced OS (177)2 Allium sativum Aqueous garlic cloves extract \u25aa 500 mg/kg significantly increased serum antioxidants level (51)Aqueous garlic bulbsextract \u25aa 150 mg/kg reduced OS (177)3 Citrus aurantifolia Citrus leaf extract supplementation \u25aa Reduced vascular damage (237)4 Citrus limon 5% lemon juice squeezed residue \u25aa Significantly lowered urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine& isoprostane(250)5 Cymbopogon citratus Aqueous aerial part extracts \u25aa 200 mg/kg significantly reduced OS (9)6 Hibiscus sabdariffa 80% methanolic leaf extract \u25aa 400 mg/kg reduction serum OS (298)7 Linum usitatissimum Flax lignan seed concentrate \u25aa Reduced OS in a dose-dependent manner (352,353)Flaxseed peptide mixture \u25aa 4 mg/ml caused 100% radical scavenging effect (354)8 Mentha\u00d7piperita Powdered peppermint water extract \u25aa Produced anti-oxidant effect (373)9 Mentha spicata Spearmint water extract \u25aa Produced anti-oxidant effect (373)Ethanolic leaf extract \u25aa Caused a dose-dependent anti-oxidant effect (29)10 Moringa oleifera Aqueous leaf extract \u25aa Reduced OS (397)11 Nigella sativa Seed oil \u25aa 2.5 mg/kg significantly reduced NADPH oxidase activity & increased HO-1 activity(428)Seed oil \u25aa 0.2 ml/kg attenuated oxidative injury (430)12 Passiflora edulis Fruit pulp \u25aa 8 g/kg significantly incresad GSH, & decreased TBARS (448)70% ethanolic seed extract, & fruit juice &pulp extract\u25aa 200 \u03bcg/mL reduced OS (449)13 Persea americana Aqueuos extracts of leaf & seed \u25aa Both extracts can scavenge ABTS radical (465)Ethanol seed extract \u25aa 500 mg/ml scavenged DPPH radical by 87.5, NO radical by 91.44%, & lipidperoxidation by 75.51%(37)14 Ruta chalpensis 70% ethanolic aerial parts extract \u25aa scavenged DPPH radical significantly (10)15 Vernonia amygdalina Methanol leaf extract \u25aa 400 mg/kg increased anti-oxidant enzymes activity (554)16 Zingiber officinale Ginger crude extract of rhizome \u25aa Produced vasoprotective activity (2)TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; NO, nitric oxide; OS, oxidative stress; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; GSH, glutathione;ABTS, 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid; DPHH, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 19 frontiersin.orgA. sativum induces vasorelaxation by generating H2S, anendogenous molecule involved in cardioprotective vascularsignaling. Organic polysulfides from garlic can be convertedinto H2S by human RBCs, a process dependent on reducedthiols on the RBC membrane and supported by cytosolicglutathione levels maintained by glucose. Allyl-substitutedpolysulfides undergo nucleophilic substitution at the allylsubstituent\u2019s \u03b1-carbon to form hydropolysulfide (RSnH), a keyintermediate in H2S synthesis. Both RSnH and H2S aregenerated through the nucleophilic substitution of sulfuratoms in organic polysulfides. Intact aortic rings can alsobreak down garlic-derived organic polysulfides to release H2Sunder physiologically relevant O2 levels. The vasorelaxationeffect of garlic compounds is closely linked to H2S production,with stronger relaxation effects corresponding to higher H2Syields.

The effectiveness of the H2S and NOsignaling pathways is influenced by various dietary and geneticfactors, such as deficiencies in folate, vitamin B6, and vitaminB12, as well as known genetic variations in themethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathionine-synthasegenes, which may contribute to HTN. Organosulfur compoundsderived from garlic could help address sulfur deficiency, one ofthe factors contributing to HTN (207).A. sativum extract, along with the steroidal and triterpenoidalsaponins in garlic, produced natriuretic and aquaretic effects inrats. It had minimal impact on K+ -excretion, which is a keycharacteristic of an effective diuretic, suggesting that garlic ismore K-sparing than furosemide. K is crucial for maintaining thebody\u2019s water and electrolyte balance and is vital for proper nerveand muscle function (184, 208). Studies have shown that garlicinhibits Na+ -transporting epithelial cells and reduces ATPaseactivity. Fractions of garlic targeting allicin induce diuretic andnatriuretic effects in rabbits, likely by inhibiting active Na+transport. This mechanism is further supported by garlic\u2019s abilityto inhibit the stimulatory effects of aldosterone, Ang-II, andADH on Na+ transport (209). A purified garlic fraction exhibiteda biphasic diuretic and natriuretic effect, with only Cl\u2212 ions, notK+ ions, following the natriuretic pattern. The purified garlicfraction also inhibited renal Na+/K+ -ATPase, likely by inhibitingthe Na+ -pump at the tubular Na+ -reabsorption level in thekidneys (210). Garlic and its preparations also help to managemajor CVD risk factors, including high serum TC, increasedLDL oxidation, enhanced platelet aggregation, and impairedfibrinolysis (184).Calpurnea aurea is a small tree or shrub with yellow flowers(211). The C. aurea subspecies aurea from Ethiopia is used inTM to manage HTN (61, 75\u201377). It has hypotensive and anti-HTN effects through relaxation of the aorta, possibly due toblood vessel dilation resulting from CCB activity (211). C. aureahas demonstrated antioxidant and antilipidemic effects inrats (212\u2013214).Carica papaya, a functional food crop, originated in theMesoamerican region, including Central America and southernMexico (215\u2013218). All parts of the C. papaya plant arepharmacologically significant due to its laticifers and activecompounds. The plant also contains the enzymes papain andchymopapain. The young leaves are particularly important inpharmacological research, as their components are more potentthan those found in mature leaves (218, 219). Traditional healershave used C. papaya as a diuretic in India (217, 220) and Cuba(221) and as an anti-HTN in Ethiopia (56, 60), Nigeria (218,220), India (217), Indonesia (222), Benin, Bougainville Island,Eritrea, French Guiana, Ghana, Guyana, Malaysia, the MarquesasIslands, Mauritius, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Suriname (172).This global ethnobotanical evidence highlights the potential of C.papaya in managing high BP.TABLE7ContinuedS.No.MedicinalPlantExtract/TreatmenttypeStudydesignPatientconditionDoseDurationResult(s)Ref.SeedspowderOpenlabelRCTMSpatientswithHTN500mgcapsule/day8weeksReducedSBPfrom166.78\u2013130.85mhg&DBPfrom88.02\u201380.84mmHg(419)PastemixtureofN.sativaseeds&honeyClinicalstudyHypercholesterolemic&healthysubjects50mg/kg/day3monthsReducedSBPby3.9%&DBPby5.5%inhypercholesterolemicsubjects(420)12PassifloraedulisFruitjuiceextractClinicalstudyNon-chronichypertensive2g/dayin2ml30daysReducedSBP(142.4\u2013125.2)&DBP(79\u201376.1mmHg)( 443)FruitpeelextractRandomized,double-blind,placebo-controlledtrialAdultT2DMsubjects220mg/day16weeksReducedmeanSBPfrom133.8\u2013126.1mmHg(444)FruitpeelextractRandomized,parallel-group,double-blind,placebo-controlledtrialStage1/2essentialHTN400mg/day4weeksDecreasedSBP&DBPsignificantlyby30.9&24.6mmHg,respectively( 447)13TamarindusindicaDried&pulverizedfruitpulpInVivoApproachHumanModel15mg/kgtwiceaday4weeksSignificantlyreducedDBP(530)14ZingiberOfficinaleRhizomesextractRandomizedsafetytrialHealthyhumans100mg/kgperday2&4hReducedSBP(114.3\u2013105.5afer2h&114.3\u2013107.6mmHgafter4h),DBP(73.3\u201370.5mmHgafter2h)&HR(78.8\u201370.2beats/minafter2h)( 560)HTN,hypertension;RCT,randomizedcontroltrial;SBP,systolicbloodpressure;DBP,diastolicbloodpressure;MS,metabolicsyndrome;MAP,meanarterialbloodpressure;HR,heartrate;BP,bloodpressure;ACEI,angiotensincovertingenzymeinhibition.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 26 frontiersin.orgC. papaya has been shown to produce hypotensive and anti-HTN effects in both animals and humans (215, 217). Theseeffects may be achieved by lowering HR or by acting directly on\u03b1-adrenergic receptors in VSMCs to relax the vessel tone orreduce catecholamine release from post-ganglionic sympatheticneurons (215). In animal models of HTN, incorporating papayaleaves into the diet helped stabilize both SBP and DBP anddecreased arterial stiffness (222). C. papaya functions as adiuretic (221) and provides chronic anti-HTN effects throughACEI. It also reversed cardiac hypertrophy (CHT) and improvedarterial baroreflex sensitivity, both of which are critical for thecontrol of mean arterial BP (MAP). HTN and the RAASsignificantly contribute to the development of CHT, and studieshave shown that ACEI Rx improves baroreflex sensitivity inpatients with HTN, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and HF.Thus, C. papaya\u2019s ability to enhance baroreflex sensitivity may beassociated with its ACEI activity, leading to a reduction in MAP(223). Papaya leaves exhibited vasorelaxation, primarily throughan endothelium-dependent release of NO (224).It is well-known that DM is often associated withhyperlipidemia and HTN. When DM is not well-controlled, therisk of kidney damage increases, leading to elevated BP. Insulinplays a key role in regulating lipoprotein synthesis, and insulinresistance (IR) in DM causes the liver to overproducelipoproteins, resulting in hyperlipidemia (222). Various in vivoand in vitro studies on C. papaya have demonstrated its anti-DMand antihyperlipidemic effects, which help reduce the risk ofdeveloping HTN. The plant has also shown hepatoprotective,antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiobesity, and antiproliferativeactivities. These studies suggest that C. papaya could be used todevelop pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products with potentialagainst various diseases. However, there has been limitedscientific research on the pharmacological properties of thecompounds extracted from the plant (218).Citrullus lanatus, native to the tropical regions of Africa nearthe Kalahari Desert, is consumed as food in various countriesand holds global significance in managing HTN (225\u2013228).Locally, it is used as a BP-lowering agent in Ethiopia (80),Palestine (171), Nigeria (229), and South Africa (230), and as adiuretic in Pakistan and India (228, 231). Watermelon has beenshown to significantly reduce BP, likely through endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to its high L-citrulline content, whichis converted to L-arginine (232). Supplementation with C.lanatus has also been found to reduce ankle and brachial BP aswell as carotid wave reflection in patients, indicating that itimproves vascular function (VF) independently of peripheral BPreduction (233). Watermelon extract exhibits therapeutic effectsagainst HTN, DM, and CVDs (227).

With its low energy density, thisfruit is recommended for weight management (225).Supplementing with NO synthesis precursors like L-arginine isessential, as vascular dysfunction (VD) often precedes CVD.However, because much of L-arginine is metabolized beforereaching the endothelium, L-citrulline supplementation isrecommended instead. Watermelon supplementation is beneficialin increasing plasma L-arginine levels and improving VF, asL-citrulline can be converted into L-arginine. In some cases,consuming a larger volume of watermelon (>700 ml) may benecessary to achieve an adequate dose of L-citrulline, which canbe challenging. L-citrulline from watermelon appears to enhanceVF by improving arterial stiffness and BP. To make regularconsumption of watermelon products (juice, extract, powder, andpuree) more feasible, food technologies like spray drying andfreeze-drying should be used to concentrate bioactive chemicalsinto smaller volumes. Microencapsulation of watermelon couldoffer a more practical and effective method to improve adherenceand vascular health in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors(235). Beyond its potential to reduce CV risk factors (236), C.lanatus has demonstrated nephroprotective, antiurolithiatic, anddiuretic effects in rats. Watermelon is a valuable diuretic fortreating dropsy (edema) related to heart and kidney conditions dueto its alkalinizing properties. C. lanatus exhibits hepatoprotective,antiinflammatory and anti-AS effects (228, 237, 238).The Citrus aurantium tree, native to eastern Africa, has been usedas an essential oil in foods (239). Traditionally, citrus plants have beencredited with anti-HTN effects in countries like Ethiopia (63, 76, 78,81\u201385), Morocco (14), Curacao, and India (239). C. aurantium hasdemonstrated ACEI activity (181). However, its extract and primarycomponent, synephrine, are known to increase BP and HR (240,241). This plant has gained popularity as a safe alternative toephedra in herbal weight-loss products due to its potential effectson metabolism, such as increasing basal metabolic rate andpromoting lipolysis, as well as acting as an appetite suppressant.Bitter orange has been included in dietary supplements for weightloss for these reasons (242). A human clinical trial showed thatorange juice could raise HDL (\u201cgood\u201d cholesterol) while loweringLDL (\u201cbad\u201d cholesterol). C. aurantium also exhibits higherantioxidant activity than many other Citrus species and has shownantiinflammatory properties. These findings suggest that p-synephrine and bitter orange extract may have beneficial effects inweight management and strenuous physical activity, asinflammation and oxidative tissue damage are linked to obesity(243). However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis reportfound no evidence that p-synephrine, a protoalkaloid extractedfrom bitter orange, can effectively facilitate weight loss (241).Citrus aurantiifolia, originating from Southeast Asia or theIndo-Malayan region, is a fruit consumed globally (244). It isalso one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in African TMand plays a key role in the formulation of many herbal remedies(224, 244). This plant is commonly used to treat HTN inEthiopia (76, 78), Ivory Coast (245), Nigeria, Pakistan (246),Benin, Congo, Cuba, Mauritius, Mexico, Rodrigues, Thailand,and Togo (172).TABLE9ContinuedS.no.Activecompound(s)SourcesStudymodel(s)Studysubject(s)Doseandresult(s)PossiblyMOA(s)Ref.no.18Carnosicacid&carnosolRosmarinusofficinalisExvivoIsolatedratthoracicaorta\u25aa0.05\u22120.80mg/mLofeachingredientsshowedadose-dependentvasorelaxantactivity-IncreasingNOlevel-Decreasingang-IIlevel(471)19TilifodiolideSalviatiliifoliaExvivoIsolatedrataorticrings\u25aa0.9\u2013298\u03bcMexhibitedvasorelaxanteffectswithEC50of48\u03bcM-MediatedbyNO&cGMP(628)20RosmarinicacidSaturejapunctataInvivoNormotensiveguineapigs\u25aa3mg/kgcaused31.78%fallinMAP-Notstudied( 489)2110-gingerol,8-gingerol,&6-gingerolZingiberofficinalePKC&PatestsBioinformaticsapproach\u25aaHavegoodvasoprotective,vasodilator(Pa>7),&anti-oxidantpotential-AT1-receptorantagonistactivity(648)228-gingerol,6-gingerol,&6-shogaolZingiberofficinaleExvivoIsolatedguinea-pigatrium,guinea-pigaorticstrips\u25aaAllcompoundsshowednegativeinotropiceffect\u25aaOnly6-shogaolshowednegativechronotropy(50%at10mg/ml)-Calciumantagonisticactivity( 569)2310-gingerol,8-gingerol,&6-gingerolZingiberofficinaleExvivoIsolatedrataorta\u25aa1.0\u2013300mg/mlofallgingerolsexhibitedvasodilationinPE-pre-contractedaorta-Ca2+-antagonistactivity(571)MOA,mechanismofaction;BP,bloodpressure;SHR,spontaneouslyhypertensiverats;SDR,Sprague-Dawleyrats;SBP,systolicbloodpressure;DBP,diastolicbloodpressure;MAP,meanarterialbloodpressure;HTN,hypertension;NO,nitricoxide;ACE,angiotensincovertingenzyme;ACEI,angiotensincovertingenzymeinhibition;L-NAME,L-nitroargininemethylester;PE,penylepinephrine;KCl,potassiumchloride;VDCCs,voltage-dependentcalciumchannels;GC,guanylylcyclases;EC50,50%effectiveconcentration;IC50,50%inhibitoryconcentration;cGMP,cyclicguanosinemonophosphate;PKC,pharmacokinetic.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 29 frontiersin.orgThe anti-HTN effects of C. aurantiifolia are likely linked toboth cardiodepressive and vasorelaxation effects through theendothelium-dependent synthesis of NO (245). This plant hasdemonstrated hypotensive effects in rats. It may also directlyinfluence SMs, increasing cGMP and cyclic adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP) levels by inhibiting vascular PDEs,leading to endothelium-independent vasorelaxation (246). Theplant has shown ACEI activity (181). Citrus leaf extract has beenfound to reduce BP and vascular damage, likely due to reducingOS, which modulates vasoactive mediators and BP-regulatingenzymes like ACE (237). Studies have also revealed theantiinflammatory properties of C. aurantiifolia. The plant\u2019sFIGURE 5Chemical structure of bioactive compounds isolated from the studied antihypertensive medicinal plants.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 30 frontiersin.orgability to induce anorexia has been associated with weight loss inmice (244). Its fruit inhibits enzymes involved in the polyolpathway, which may help mitigate complications related toDM (247).Citrus limon likely originates from southern Asia (248). Incountries like Ethiopia (63, 83, 84), Palestine (171), and SouthAfrica (232), this plant is used to treat HTN. Lemon juice,widely accepted as a healthy food, is often consumed during orafter exercise due to its nutritional and functional benefits (249,250). Studies suggest that lemon juice may reduce SBP inhypertensive rats, potentially through ACEI activity (249). It alsoacts as an antioxidant, preventing CVD (250, 251), and hasdiuretic and antiproliferative properties. C. limon hashypocholesterolemic effects and increases HDL levels (13). Sinceboth lemon consumption and physical activity independentlylower SBP through different mechanisms, it has been suggestedthat combining them could be therapeutic for high BP in adults.Together, they might have additive or synergistic effects (252).Consuming lemon juice also contributes to improving patientwell-being (253).Citrus medica is thought to have originated in India and AsiaMinor. This fragrant fruit is consumed both as a functional foodand for its therapeutic benefits (254, 255). It has demonstratedanti-HTN effects in rats by enhancing biochemical and oxidativestatus while protecting the liver, kidneys, and vascularendothelium from damage (256). The leaves of C. medica havealso shown significant diuretic activity in rats (257). Variousstudies have highlighted the plant\u2019s antioxidant, cardioprotective,antihyperglycemic, antilipidemic, anti-HC, nephroprotective(antilithiatic), and antiinflammatory properties (258\u2013260).Coccinia grandis, native to Asia, India, and Central Africa, isprimarily cultivated as a food crop in various countries. Its stem,root, leaf, and fruit are valued for their medicinal properties andare used to treat a variety of ailments (261\u2013263). In TMpractices, C. grandis is used as an anti-HTN in Ethiopia (57) andas a diuretic in India (264). It also exhibits anti-DM, anti-HC,and ACEI activities (265, 266). In rats, C. grandis has showndiuretic effects comparable to those of furosemide (264).Pharmacological research has highlighted the plant\u2019s antioxidant,anti-inflammatory, anti-urolithiatic, and hepatoprotectiveproperties (261, 262).Coriandrum sativum, a well-known herb native to WesternAsia and Europe (267\u2013269), has edible parts throughout theplant, with fresh leaves and dried seeds commonly used as spicesand in TM (270). In India, coriander plays a significant role inAyurveda as an essential crude drug (268). It is used as an anti-HTN remedy by local communities in Ethiopia (57), Morocco(14), and Palestine (171), and as a diuretic in Morocco (270),India (269, 270), and Argentina (269).Coriander has been shown to lower BP in rats throughvasodilation, involving both cholinergic and CCB mechanisms.Its diuretic properties likely enhance its anti-HTN effects (267).The plant exhibits biphasic vasorelaxation: its immediate effect isdue to endothelium-dependent NO release, while the delayedeffect results from the inhibition of voltage-dependent CCs(VDCCs) and receptor-operated CCs (ROCCs), which preventsCa2+ influx (268). C. sativum has the potential to inhibit ACE,making it a valuable functional food with ACEI properties (38).Consuming coriander, either alone or with garlic, has shownsignificant anti-DM and anti-HTN effects in patients with DMand HTN (191).Coriander has been shown to have diuretic and saluretic effectsin animals, similar to those of furosemide (270, 271). In studies,coriander extract led to a greater excretion of Na+ than K+,indicating it may be a highly effective and safe diuretic. Thiseffect might result from increased regional blood flow, initialvasodilation, or inhibition of water and anion reabsorption in thekidneys (272, 273). C. sativum has been found to lower elevatedlevels of IR, TC, LDLC, and triglycerides (TG) while normalizingblood sugar levels. As a result, it may offer CV protection byreducing various MS components, decreasing AS, and enhancingheart-protective markers. The plant also exhibits antioxidant andliver-protective properties (268, 274).Globally, Croton species have been traditionally used to treatHTN and edema-related conditions (275, 276). In Ethiopia,Croton macrostachyus is specifically employed to manage BP andurinary retention (86). Extracts of C. macrostachyus have shownaquaretic and aliuretic effects in rats (275). In addition, itpossesses antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-DM, andcardioprotective properties (277, 278). Within the same genus,the essential oil of Croton argyrophylloides has demonstrated avasodilator effect in aortic rings (276).The genus Cymbopogon, which originated in India, isrenowned for its high concentration of essential oils. Among itsspecies, C. citratus is one of the most widely distributed plants(279). Traditionally, lemongrass has been used as an anti-HTNremedy in Ethiopia (65), Argentina, Brazil, Cuba (279), Senegal(280), Benin, Bolivia, Congo, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, thePhilippines, and Thailand (172). It serves as a diuretic in Braziland Egypt (279).Lemongrass tea has been shown to induce a hypotensive effectin humans, reducing both MAP and HR, due to its variousbioactive components (45). Individuals treated with C. citratusexperienced a significant diuretic effect, similar to loop diureticsbut with a K-sparing benefit. This combined or synergistic effectof C. citratus phytochemicals at one or multiple target sites mayhelp mitigate the side effects typically associated with syntheticloop diuretics (281). The anti-HTN mechanisms of C. citratusmay be linked to its vasorelaxant, antioxidant, lipid-lowering,hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective/diuretic activities, whichare attributed to its phenolic and flavonoid content (9). It hasalso demonstrated the diuretic and antiinflammatory propertiesin rats (282, 283).A lemongrass extract has shown vasorelaxation effects in exvivo studies. This activity seems to involve several biochemicalmediators, including NO, prostanoids, and endothelium-derivedhyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs) (224). The relaxation effect onvascular SMs, independent of the endothelium, is likely due toalterations in intracellular Ca2+ levels. The effect may bemediated by a PG, as the leaf infusion demonstratescyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated vasorelaxant effects in thehuman thoracic artery (284). Research by Nambiar et al. (285)Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 31 frontiersin.orghighlighted lemongrass\u2019s antioxidant and antiinflammatoryproperties, which help prevent blood vessel damage byincreasing NO levels, aiding vasodilation. Lemongrass alsoexhibits hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective (286), anti-proliferative(287), hypolipidemic, renoprotective, and cardioprotectiveactivities (288).Foeniculum vulgare is a plant known for its aromatic scent andsweet seeds, commonly used as flavoring agents (289). Originallynative to southern Europe and the Mediterranean (290), it isutilized in TM for managing HTN in Ethiopia (57, 60, 76),Morocco (291), and Palestine (171), and serves as a diuretic inFrance (292). Research shows that it lowers BP and has diureticeffects in animals (271, 273, 291, 292). It has been found toexhibit ACEI activity (181). Marrubium vulgare, a species relatedto F. vulgare, has demonstrated vascular relaxant effects on rataorta (291). Numerous studies confirm F. vulgare as anantioxidant, antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, hypoglycemic,hypolipidemic, antianxiety, and hepatoprotective agent (290, 293).Hibiscus sabdariffa is native to India and Malaysia, with itscalyxes commonly used in both culinary applications and TM(294\u2013296). Known as roselle, it is utilized in TM to treat HTN inEthiopia (56, 91), Morocco (14), Nigeria (297\u2013299), Senegal(299), Egypt (294, 300), Mexico (301, 302), Palestine (171),Jordan (300, 303), and Trinidad and Tobago (300). It serves as adiuretic in Mexico (301), India (296), and Germany (304). Thiswidespread usage across various countries suggests that extractsor compounds from H. sabdariffa have the potential to becomefuture anti-HTN medications.A clinical study found that H. sabdariffa (sour tea) is effectivein treating both uncontrolled HTN (303, 305) and essential HTN(306). It was shown to be as effective as captopril (307).Drinking sour tea significantly lowered BP in patients with stage1 HTN (308). A systematic review and meta-analysis ofrandomized clinical trials (RCTs) revealed that sour teaconsumption significantly reduces fasting plasma glucose levels(by 3.67 mg/dl), SBP (by 4.71 mmHg), and DBP (by4.08 mmHg). It showed a significant reduction in LDLC levels.Therefore, drinking sour tea may aid in controlling BP andglycemic levels in adults (309).The anti-HTN effect of H. sabdariffa can be driven by itsantioxidant and negative chronotropic effects (298). It also inducesvasorelaxation through both endothelium-dependent (activation ofthe NO/cGMP pathway) and independent mechanisms (inhibitionof Ca2+ influx into VSMCs, likely through the blocking of voltage-gated CCs (VGCCs)) (310). Sour tea, either alone or combinedwith captopril, significantly reduced BP, ACE activity, and plasmaAng-II levels in rats. While it could be used as a supplement withcaptopril, it may not offer additional benefits (311). The calyxes ofH. sabdariffa significantly lowered plasma aldosterone levels andinhibited renin activity. They also reduced iNOS, increased eNOSlevels in the heart and aorta, and raised NO levels in plasma. Theplant extracts demonstrated cardioprotective effects through theirantiinflammatory properties (294). In hypertensive patients, Rxwith H. sabdariffa standardized for anthocyanins lowered bothSBP and DBP and also reduced serum Na+ concentrations withoutaffecting K+ levels (312).Consistent with its effects on laboratory animals (311, 312), H.sabdariffa extract has been shown to lower BP and exhibit diureticactivity in humans. The findings suggest no significant difference ineffectiveness and tolerability between H. sabdariffa and captopril,implying that the plant may contain ACEI compounds. Thediuretic effect resembles that of spironolactone-type (302). H.sabdariffa reduced serum ACE and plasma aldosterone levelswith similar effectiveness to lisinopril in hypertensive Nigerians.The stronger effect on aldosterone compared to ACE may be dueto the blocking of AT1-receptors and the inhibitory action ofMg2+ in the extract on aldosterone secretion (313). Recentstudies have confirmed the natriuretic and K-sparing effects ofH. sabdariffa extracts in rats (271, 314, 315). These extractssignificantly reduced the expression of the alpha epithelial Na+ -channel (\u03b1ENaC) in renal epithelial cells (314). These effects arepartly attributed to the modulation of aldosterone activity byanthocyanins, flavonoids (such as quercetin and rutin), andphenylpropanoids like chlorogenic acid (particularly5-caffeoylquinic acid) present in the extract. Quercetin\u2019s effect onthe vascular endothelium enhances NO release, leading to increasedrenal vasorelaxation and improved kidney filtration (301, 314).Multiple studies have shown that H. sabdariffa exhibits anti-HC, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties (315,316). This MP also has antianxiety (295) and anti-AS effects,which are beneficial in treating HTN (312). The mechanismsbehind the hypotensive and anti-HTN effects of roselle extractsinclude the stimulation of new blood vessel formation, reductionof myocardial mass, lowering blood viscosity through COX-inhibitory activity, and inhibition of adipocyte differentiation bymodulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B(PI3-K/Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)pathways (300).The availability and low cost of Hordeum vulgare make it anexcellent candidate for developing functional foods (317\u2013319).Barley has long been used to treat various inflammatoryconditions and CVDs. It aligns well with the modern dietaryconcept of \u201cthree high and two low,\u201d being high in protein, fiber,and vitamins, and low in fat and sugar. This makes itparticularly beneficial for individuals with DM, HTN, obesity,and CVDs (318). The United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has approved labeling for barley-basedfoods, allowing claims that consuming these foods may reducethe risk of CHD (320). H. vulgare is traditionally used as ananti-HTN in Ethiopia (92) and Palestine (171) and as a diureticin India (321).H. vulgare seeds have shown antiurolithiatic, antioxidant, andnephroprotective effects in rats (321, 322). They have alsodemonstrated ACEI activity (320, 323) and antiinflammatoryactivities (324). Juice from H. vulgare grass, a nutraceutical plant,has exhibited antiobesity effects in rats (50). The seeds alsodisplayed anti-DM activity in rats through an \u03b1-glucosidaseinhibitory mechanism (325, 326). This effect is further supportedby the bioactive peptides (peptide hydrolysates) in H. vulgare,which inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) (319). Numerousstudies have shown that DPP-4 inhibition can reduce endothelialdysfunction, inflammation, and AS progression (327).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 32 frontiersin.orgThe most extensively studied species of the Jatropha plant interms of nutrition is Jatropha curcas (328, 329). Various parts ofJ. curcas are utilized in TM across the globe (330). For instance,its root and latex are known for their significant antioxidant,anti-HTN, antiplatelet, and antiinflammatory properties (331).Ethnomedically, the Physic nut is used as an anti-HTN inEthiopia (93) and Cameroon (330) and as a diuretic elsewhere(332). A protein hydrolysate and its peptide fractions from J.curcas have demonstrated ACEI activity (328). Another specieswithin the same genus, Jatropha gossypiifolia, has shownhypotensive effects in rats by acting on adrenoceptors and/orreducing Ca2+ mobilization (333). The fruits of J. curcas haveexhibited cardioprotective effects in rats (331, 334). J. curcasholds potential for treating chronic hypertensive kidney disease(335) and has also demonstrated anti-DM effects in rats (332).Leucaena leucocephala is native to Northern Central Americaand Southern Mexico (336, 337). Various parts of this plant areused for medicinal purposes (337, 338). The entire plant is usedto manage HTN in Ethiopia (72). Its seeds are now utilized as adietary protein source in both human and animal diets. Theprotein hydrolysates from this plant have demonstratedantioxidant, ACEI, and anti-DM properties (339, 340). L.leucocephala has shown diuretic effects in mice (341). Extractsfrom the White Lead tree possess antiinflammatory activities(342, 343). The plant has also been associated withhypocholesterolemic, hypoglycemic, and BP-lowering effects(342), and its antiproliferative and hepatoprotective propertiesare used medicinally (338).Linum usitatissimum, one of the oldest cultivated plants (344),is native to Egypt and temperate regions of Europe and Asia(345\u2013347). Flaxseed is known as a functional food (346) and isused by traditional healers to treat HTN in Ethiopia (57) andMorocco (14). The anti-HTN benefits of L. usitatissimum can beachieved through dietary consumption. For instance, daily intakeof milled flaxseed has been shown to lower BP in patients withperipheral artery disease. Circulating levels of \u03b1-linolenic acid areassociated with both SBP and DBP, while lignan levels correlatewith changes in DBP (348). Flaxseed has effectively reduced BP,TC, and BMI in hypertensive individuals (349). A systematicreview and meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that flaxseed oilconsumption reduced SBP by 3.86 mmHg in patients with MSand related disorders. The BP-lowering effects of flaxseed oil arethought to involve ACEI, NO generation, as well as antioxidantand antiinflammatory properties. The dietary fiber in L.usitatissimum oil can help manage blood lipids, reduce IR, andimprove intestinal microbiota, which may contribute to lower BPand weight loss (350). Flaxseed consumption has also beenshown to lower BP in hypertensive patients by affectingcirculating oxylipins (351).Flax lignan concentrate demonstrated an anti-HTN effect, withits maximum dose showing efficacy comparable to that ofcaptopril, suggesting ACEI properties. The plant may lower BPby decreasing Ang-II levels, inhibiting ET-1 production, andstimulating NOS (352, 353). Protein hydrolysates with a higherFischer ratio also displayed antioxidant and ACEI activities.Consequently, this versatile L. usitatissimum peptide mixturecould be used to develop dietary products beneficial foraddressing OS and HTN (354). The seed extract lowered arterialBP and reduced both the force and rate of spontaneouscontractions in guinea pig atria. It also shifted the phenylephrine(PE)-induced concentration-response curves (CRCs) to the right,similar to the effect of prazosin. These findings suggest thatflaxseed may exert \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism and CCB-like activities (355). Animal studies have shown that dietary L.usitatissimum can provide anti-AS, antiinflammatory,nephroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-DM effects, alongwith lowering cholesterol and trans fats, which may contribute toits BP-lowering benefits (347, 356).Lupinus albus, native to the Mediterranean region, istraditionally prepared by soaking, scalding, and dehulling theseeds, which are then consumed as a snack in the Middle East(357, 358). In Ethiopia, L. albus is cultivated, and an alcoholicbeverage called \u201cGebto Arekei\u201d is used in TM to treat HTN,along with other food products (12). The plant is alsotraditionally used for managing HTN in Ethiopia (57, 73, 87, 94,95) and Palestine (171). A decoction made from the root of L.albus is utilized as a diuretic in Unani Medicine (357).\u201cGebto Arekei\u201d is a traditional medicinal spirit made from afermented brew that includes L. albus seeds. The residue fromthis spirit has been shown to lower HTN in guinea pigs (359).The distilled extract of L. albus significantly promotesvasorelaxation in aortic strips through the eNOS-NO-cGMPpathway, which involves the opening of K+ -channels andsubsequent inhibition of VDCCs (360). Bioactive peptidesderived from lupin seeds exhibit anti-HTN effects through ACEIactivity. The plant also demonstrated antioxidant,antiinflammatory, and antiproliferative properties (358, 361). Dueto their high content of non-starch carbohydrates, which areslowly digested, L. albus seeds have low glycemic indexes andrelease glucose gradually into the bloodstream, potentiallyhelping to prevent IR-related disorders (357). L. albus seeds haveshown significant hypoglycemic effects in rabbits, increasinginsulin levels and reducing IR. Over a 12-week period, L. albussignificantly decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and plasmaTC (362\u2013365). White lupin has also been noted for its anti-ASactivity (357).Melia azedarach, commonly found in Pakistan, India, SouthernChina, Southeast Asia, and Australia, has long been used in TM totreat various ailments (366, 367). In Ethiopia (96) and Indonesia(368), chinaberry is used as a remedy for HTN, while in India, itis employed for treating heart disorders and as a diuretic (369).It is also a key component in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine formanaging DM and HTN (370). Studies have shown that extractsfrom M. azedarach exhibit anti-HTN effects in rats (42) throughreducing HR and contraction strength, relaxing blood vesselsthrough the NO pathway, and CCB (370). Its leavesdemonstrated ACEI activity (368). The plant has been found tooffer nephroprotective and diuretic benefits in rats (371), alongwith antioxidant properties (366, 369). Further research hasconfirmed its antiinflammatory and cardioprotective effects (42).Mentha\u00d7piperita, native to Asia and Europe (372), iscommonly used as a flavoring agent (373, 374). In TM, it is usedNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 33 frontiersin.orgin Ethiopia to treat HTN (61, 75, 97) and as a diuretic and litholyticelsewhere (375). Studies have shown that M. piperita can lower BPin hypertensive patients (376). Peppermint has been found toreduce glycemia, TC, TGs, and LDL while increasing HDL levelsin humans (377). Its anti-HTN effects are mainly due to itsantioxidant, ACEI, and diuretic properties, along with anti-DM,anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-AS, and anti-inflammatory activities(373, 374). Peppermint extracts have also demonstratednephroprotective effects in animal studies (378). Another speciesin the same genus, Mentha longifolia, has shown hypotensive,anti-HR, and HR-lowering effects in rats (379). Peppermint oil\u2019sability to relax SMs suggests it may promote vasodilation,possibly through mechanisms involving PGs and NOS (372). M.piperita may play a vital role in preventing AS and othercardiopulmonary diseases (380). Mentha species have beenshown to possess hepatoprotective properties (381).Several species of Mentha are used in TM both as flavoringagents and herbal remedies (382, 383). Mentha spicata istraditionally used to manage HTN in Ethiopia (65), Palestine(171), and Morocco (14). In Morocco, it is utilized as a diureticin TM (384). Similar to peppermint, spearmint has shownantioxidant and ACEI activity (373). In rats, it exhibits diureticeffects through a CAI mechanism (29). The essential oil hasdemonstrated antiproliferative properties (382). M. spicata alsooffers potential antiinflammatory and anti-DM benefits (384).Moringa oleifera is primarily found in the sub-Himalayanregion, though it is now widely used in food, nutraceuticals, andmedicine, earning the nickname \u201cmiracle tree\u201d (385\u2013387). Tribalhealers in Ethiopia (63), Senegal (280), Bangladesh, Benin,Eritrea, Ghana, India, and many other countries (172) useMoringa to manage HTN. In TM systems in America, it is usedto treat systemic arterial HTN (388). In Pakistan, the roots ofMoringa are utilized in TM as a diuretic and to treat kidneystones (389).Moringa leaves have been found to effectively lower BP in bothhypertensive patients and healthy individuals (390\u2013392). Manybelieve it is more effective than modern medicine, as Moringa leafprovides a more consistent reduction in BP over a short period,unlike some modern Rxs. As a result, M. oleifera leaves can beconsidered an alternative therapy for HTN. Modernpharmaceuticals isolate specific phytochemicals to producemedicines, but consuming the whole Moringa leaf allows thevarious phytochemicals to work together, enhancing their overalleffect (385). Moringa leaves not only lower BP in normal andobese hypertensive individuals but also promote weight loss,offering an added benefit for managing HTN in obese patients (393).In animal studies, M. oleifera also demonstrated hypotensiveand anti-HTN effects. Extracts, including those containinggamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), led to BP reduction in rats(394, 395). These effects are partly attributed to an endothelium-dependent vasodilator effect, primarily through activation of theeNOS-NO-soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) pathway, along withreductions in HR and CCB activity. Moringa\u2019s antioxidantproperties further reduce OS and VD (11, 396\u2013398). Besides,Moringa extracts may work by inhibiting adrenergicreceptors (399).In another study, a peptide fraction smaller than 1 kDa, derivedfrom M. oleifera leaves, showed significant BP-lowering effects.This was attributed to the small peptide size and the presence ofaromatic and hydrophobic amino acids. Two specific peptides,with the sequences Leu-Gly-Phe-Phe (LGF) and Gly-Leu-Phe-Phe (GLFF), significantly reduced BP in rats and inhibited bothrenin and ACE activity. It was confirmed that LGF and GLFF areresistant to gastrointestinal digestion, maintaining their structure.These findings suggest that Moringa-derived peptides could serveas potential therapeutic agents for managing HTN (8).Moringa extracts also act as ACEIs (400\u2013402) and have shownsignificant diuretic effects (402\u2013405). The saluretic index indicatesthat these extracts may function as loop diuretics or CAIs (405).Pharmacological research has confirmed that Moringa extractspossess a range of beneficial activities, including antispasmodic,anti-DL, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective,antiproliferative, and antiinflammatory effects (11, 387, 401, 403).As a result, M. oleifera extracts hold promise for developmentinto effective anti-HTN products.Moringa stenopetala is native to northeastern tropical Africaand is a common vegetable in southwestern Ethiopia. It has avariety of traditional uses, including as food and in medicinalapplications (406, 407). In Ethiopia, it is widely used to treatHTN, and a standardized herbal product made from Moringa isavailable on the local market (57, 69, 72, 75, 76, 80, 99\u2013101).Studies on M. stenopetala have shown it to have hypotensive andanti-HTN effects in animals. Its leaf extract inducesvasorelaxation by blocking voltage-sensitive CCs (VSCCs) andexhibits antispasmodic effects (18, 408). Both microencapsulatedbioactive products and leaf extracts demonstrated anti-DM,vasodilatory, and diuretic effects in rats (409, 410). The diureticeffect was comparable to that of furosemide, with significantnatriuretic and kaliuretic effects. These findings support itstraditional use for managing HTN (406). Pharmacological studiesfurther highlight the plant\u2019s antioxidant, antiinflammatory, andanti-DL properties (18, 407).Nigella sativa, native to South and Southwest Asia, has been usedfor centuries in Arab countries, the Indian subcontinent, and Europefor both culinary andmedicinal purposes (411\u2013413). In TM, it is usedto manage HTN in Ethiopia (57), Morocco (14), Algeria, and Egypt,and as a diuretic in China (411) and Pakistan (45). In Islamictradition, the \u201cblack seed,\u201d as it is called in Arabic, is considered auniversal healer, able to treat all ailments except aging and death(414). Given the high prevalence of HTN alongside DL, manyhypertensive patients may benefit from Rxs that also lower lipidlevels. N. sativa seeds and their oil are recommended for managingDM and HC due to their significant antioxidant, anti-HTN,antiobesity, antihyperlipidemic, and hypoglycemic effects inhumans. Studies found that its BP-lowering effect (71%) exceededthat of the positive control (57%) (415\u2013420).In animal studies, N. sativa extract and oil demonstratedendothelium-independent vasorelaxation, primarily through theblockage of ROCCs and VDCCs, activation of K+ ATP-channels,and suppression of IP3-mediated receptors (421, 422). Thissuggests that Nigella oil could be effective as an anti-HTN inhumans. N. sativa significantly reduced cardiac contractility andNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 34 frontiersin.orgHR in guinea pigs, with effects greater than those of diltiazem,indicating the extracts might act as CCBs or K+ -channel openersin the heart (423). Other N. sativa extracts inducedvasorelaxation in aortic rings, likely due to increased endothelialNO production. In rats, the extract also had a hypotensive effect,possibly by inhibiting SNS activity (424). Bothdethymoquinonated and regular volatile oil from black seedlowered arterial BP and HR in rats, with the CV depressanteffects potentially mediated by central mechanisms involvingactivation of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic and muscarinic pathways(425, 426).HTN and T2DM often occur together, and the onset of DM isfrequently linked to pre-HTN and HTN. Thus, managing eitherDM or BP in affected individuals could reduce the likelihood ofdeveloping the other condition (426). Studies showed that crudeextract and ammonium sulfate fractions of N. sativa are effectivein inhibiting both Dpp-4 and ACE. The crude extract exhibitedthe highest ACEI, likely due to the presence of other water-soluble compounds. The 30% ammonium sulfate fraction had thepronounced inhibitory activity against both ACE and Dpp-4,while the 60% fraction showed the highest trypsin inhibitoryactivity. Trypsin inhibitors from various plants are known fortheir antiproliferative properties (427). The anti-HTN effects ofN. sativa seed oil are thought to stem from reduced OS in theheart, increased ACEI, enhanced cardiac heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) activity, and prevention of plasma NO loss. HO-1\u2019s anti-HTNeffects result from its production of carbon monoxide, which actsas a vasodilator by stimulating NO release, reducing SNS activity,and promoting Na+ excretion. The BP-lowering effect of N.sativa oil was comparable to that of the standard drugnicardipine (428).N. sativa has demonstrated anti-HTN effects and protectionagainst HTN-induced tissue damage, improving CVS function inrats. This suggests that N. sativa may have a promising potentialfor treating renovascular HTN (RVH) (429, 430). It exhibiteddiuretic activity in rats, with Na+ excretion levels lower than thereference standard, indicating a reduced risk of hyponatremia(431). The K+ levels in the urine of the treated groups weresimilar to those in frusemide-treated animals, suggesting a loopdiuretic-like effect (41). N. sativa has also shownnephroprotective, antiinflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects,and a reduction in ischemia-reperfusion injury (432, 433).Otostegia integrifolia, endemic to Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Yemen,is well-known in Ethiopia for its distinct aroma and robustmedicinal properties (434, 435). It has been traditionally used totreat HTN in both Ethiopia (57, 84) and Eritrea (44). Rat BPsignificantly decreased after administration of the leaf extract,and aortic strips also showed relaxation. Similar to nifedipine,the extract shifted the Ca2+ CRC to the right, suggesting that itsvasorelaxant effect is likely mediated through CCB activity (44).O. integrifolia extracts have antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-DM, and oral GT-enhancing effects (435\u2013437).Passiflora edulis, native to Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, isoften consumed fresh as fruit pulp or juice (438\u2013440). It is usedin traditional remedies in various countries (441). The plant hasbeen employed to manage HTN in Ethiopia (60, 68), SouthAmerica, and India (442) and is commonly used as a diuretic inChina, South America, and India (441). In hypertensive patients,passion fruit juice has been shown to lower BP and exhibits highantioxidant activity (443). A significant reduction in SBP andfasting blood glucose levels was observed after administering aflavonoid-rich peel extract to adults with T2DM. Purple passionfruit provided further reductions in SBP when used alongsideanti-HTN drugs (444).P. edulis extracts significantly reduced BP and HR inhypertensive rats (445, 446). Its fruit extract, which containsbioflavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins, significantlylowered BP in SHR. The results suggest that the anti-HTN effectsof the extract may be partly due to the down-regulation of iNOSexpression by compounds such as quercetin, luteolin, andcyanidin 3-O-glucoside, or through the scavenging of NOradicals by quercetin with help from other flavonoids. Themodulation of NO production and the scavenging of free O2species by flavonoids may reduce peroxynitrite anion formation,thereby minimizing its negative impact on the body\u2019s antioxidantsystem. This leads to changes in vascular tone and peripheralvessel resistance, ultimately lowering BP (446). Another potentialanti-HTN mechanism involves the down-regulation of ENaCexpression in the kidney by quercetin, which influences fluidvolume through Na+ reabsorption in the kidney (447).In hypertensive rats, yellow passion fruit pulp significantlyreduced SBP. Rx with this fruit pulp showed a protective effecton the kidneys (448). Along with vasodilation, the extracts werefound to possess antiinflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, anti-DM,and antiglycant properties (438, 449). A clinical trial indicatedthat P. edulis fruit juice is a safe and effective co-adjuvant toenalapril for lowering BP (450). The vasorelaxant effect mayprimarily occur through the opening of K+ -channels (451). Theplant also demonstrated cardioprotective effects (452). P. edulisextracts were found to have significant ACEI activity andexhibited diuretic effects in rats (453, 454). Similarly, Passifloranepalensis, a related species, showed prominent diuretic effects inrats (455). The fruit peel extracts of P. edulis have proven to be arich source of bioactive substances that could be used in theproduction of pharmaceutical or nutraceutical products tomanage HTN.Persea americana, native to Mexico and Central or SouthAmerica, is often called a \u201csuperfood\u201d due to its exceptionalnutritional and phytochemical profile compared to other fruits(456\u2013459). In West African countries (460) and Brazil (43),avocado leaves are used as a diuretic, and in Brazil and Jamaica,they are used to treat high BP (461). P. americana is utilized inTM across various countries, including Ethiopia (75, 102), Benin,French Guiana, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Indonesia, Mauritius,Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines, South Africa, Suriname,and Togo, for managing HTN (172). This widespread usehighlights the plant\u2019s potential medicinal value in addressing HTN.P. americana extracts have shown hypotensive, bradycardic,and vasorelaxant effects in animal studies (43, 456, 460). Thenon-parallel rightward shift of the NE CRC caused by the extractsuggests its action involves blocking \u03b11-adrenoceptors. Thevasorelaxation effect is likely due to endothelium-dependent NONureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 35 frontiersin.orgproduction and cGMP release (460). The extract also inducedsignificant vasorelaxation in isolated rat aorta, depending on thesynthesis or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors(EDRFs), the activation of prostanoid receptors (PGI2 andPGE2), blocking VDCCs, and, to a lesser degree, ROCCs (461).The extract also demonstrated cardioprotective effects in rats (462).P. americana revealed ACEI activity comparable to captopril(463\u2013466). Nanoparticle extracts significantly lowered BP,reduced ACE activity, and increased serum nitrite and nitratelevels in hypertensive rats. The nanoparticle method minimizesdosing frequency while optimizing efficacy in target organs dueto improved pharmacokinetics (466). The extract also exhibiteddiuretic effects (465\u2013467), increasing Na+ excretion more thanK+, a desirable trait for diuretics to reduce the risk ofhyperkalemia. Cl\u2212 excretion was also significantly elevated,indicating a natriuretic effect (37). Overall, avocado has beenshown to possess antioxidant, lipid-lowering, anti-DM,antiobesity, antithrombotic, anti-AS, and antiinflammatoryproperties in various studies (457, 458, 463, 468, 469).Rosmarinus officinalis, native to the Mediterranean region, isused as a culinary spice, a natural food preservative, anornamental plant, and for its medicinal properties (470).Traditionally, rosemary is employed to manage HTN in Ethiopia(94, 101), Morocco (14), and Palestine (171). The plant showedanti-HTN effects through vasorelaxant activity, likely due toincreased NO production and reduced ang-II levels (471).Rosemary leaf extract displayed diuretic effects in rats (472). Itsextract and volatile oil exhibited spasmolytic activity, potentiallythrough muscarinic receptor and CC blockade (473, 474).Additional benefits of rosemary include antioxidant,antiinflammatory, anti-AS, anti-HC, anti-DM, antiproliferative,and glycemia-lowering effects (470, 475).Rumex abyssinicus, native to Ethiopia, has edible tender shootsand leaves (46, 476, 477). In Ethiopian TM, it is used to treat HTN(57, 73, 75, 77, 81, 83, 84, 89, 92, 104), while in Pakistan\u2019sethnomedicine, its leaves are used as diuretics (478). Therhizomes of R. abyssinicus have demonstrated diuretic effects inmice, with activity similar to furosemide, suggesting that theactive compounds may act in a similar way. The rapid onset ofdiuretic action indicates quick absorption from the intestine, andthe ethanolic fraction has a long-lasting effect, particularly athigher doses, which is beneficial for reducing the frequency ofadministration of loop diuretics (46, 476). A related species,Rumex acetosa, has shown anti-HTN effects in rats throughvasodilation (479). Extracts and compounds from R. abyssinicusalso exhibit antioxidant, antiinflammatory, hepatoprotective, andanti-DM properties (478, 480).Ruta chalepensis, native to Mediterranean Europe and WesternAsia, is cultivated for ornamental purposes, as a food flavoring, andprimarily for medicinal uses (481, 482). In Mexican (481) andEthiopian (57, 73) folk medicine, rue has been used as a Rx forHTN. R. chalepensis has shown a significant hypotensive effect inrats, potentially through \u03b1-adrenergic mechanisms (481). Theplant also demonstrated noteworthy antioxidant and vasorelaxantactivities by reducing OS and inflammation, modulating theRAAS, or improving ECs and VF through its phytochemicals(10). R. chalepensis infusion in rats caused an endothelium-dependent increase in the release of COX-dependentvasoconstrictor prostanoids and basal NO release. It is likely thatthe rise in NO acts as a compensatory mechanism for theincreased release of prostanoids (482). The BP-lowering effect ofRuta montana, a related species within the same genus, furthersupports the anti-HTN activity of R. chalepensis (483). R.chalepensis has demonstrated antispasmodic and plateletaggregation inhibition activities (484, 485).The leaves and flowers of Satureja species are used to produceessential oils, commonly utilized for food flavoring and medicinalpurposes (486\u2013488). In Ethiopia, Satureja punctata is used tomanage HTN (56, 93). It has been shown to relax the aorta andreduce BP in rats, likely through blockage of Ca2+ influx.Additionally, the plant extracts have demonstrated anti-DM,antioxidant, and hepatoprotective properties (489\u2013491).Schinus molle, a tree native to the subtropical regions of SouthAmerica, produces red, edible fruit with a high aromatic andchemical content (492\u2013496). In TM, both in Ethiopia (84) andSouth America (497), S. molle is used to treat HTN. It iscommonly used in Peruvian folk medicine as a hypotensiveagent (498) and serves as a diuretic in various TM systems (492,495, 499, 500). Extracts of S. molle have been shown tosignificantly lower MAP in normal rats. At a 100 \u03bcg/ml dose, theextract reduced the contractile response to noradrenaline (NA) inthe rat vas deferens, suggesting that it acts as NA receptorantagonist (498). S. molle leaf extracts have demonstrated ACEIactivity (501) as well as antiinflammatory and anti-spasmodiceffects (494, 495). The essential oils and various extracts alsoexhibit promising antioxidant properties (502, 503).Solanum nigrum is a lesser-known food crop in manydeveloping countries (504, 505). Both its berries and leaves areedible, though the leaves contain high levels of alkaloids thatrequire cooking to remove their toxicity (504). In Ethiopia, theplant is traditionally used to manage HTN (85), and it serves asa diuretic in both Libya and traditional Chinese medicine (504).Studies on normal and diabetic rats showed that the fruit of S.nigrum causes vasodilation. In diabetics, this vasorelaxation ismediated by both the endothelium and SM, while in non-diabetics, it occurs through direct action on the SM, independentof the endothelium (506). S. nigrum has been reported to havehypotensive (504, 507), ACEI (464), and cardioprotectiveproperties (508). The leaf extracts exhibit diuretic effects similarto furosemide, but with the added benefit of maintaining K+levels (509). Several Solanum species are known for their anti-HTN and diuretic properties (510\u2013513). The plant also exhibitsanti-DM, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, antiinflammatory,hepatoprotective, and antiproliferative effects, all of which maycontribute to its anti-HTN activity (504, 514\u2013517).Syzygium guineense is a fragrant plant native to the woodedsavannahs and tropical forests of Africa, known for its ediblefruits (518, 519). In Ethiopian TM, it is used to manage HTN(105, 518). S. guineense has been shown to lower BP in rats andinduce vasorelaxation in the aorta (518). An extract from thebark has demonstrated sustained hypotensive and antispasmodiceffects (520). Related species like S. samarangense and S. cuminiNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 36 frontiersin.orghave shown anti-HTN properties (521\u2013523). Scientific evidencesupports S. guineense\u2019s effectiveness against DM andinflammation (524), and its extracts have exhibited organo-protective and antioxidant activities (525).Tamarindus indica is a widely used ingredient in Indiancuisine, originating from tropical Africa and found in CentralAmerica and Asia (526\u2013528). In TM, tamarind has been utilizedfor treating HTN in Ethiopia (106), Palestine (171), and Senegal(279). Its diuretic properties have been documented (529), withtamarind fruit pulps outstandingly lowering DBP, TC, and LDLCin humans (530). Tamarind has demonstrated considerablediuretic effects in rats, leading to a significant increase in theexcretion of K+, Cl\u2212, and Mg2+ ions, as well as a marked rise inurinary oxalate excretion (271, 529).Extracts from both sour and sweet tamarind have been shownto have anti-HTN effects in rats. Further advanced preclinical andclinical studies may establish ripened sour tamarind extract as amore effective anti-HTN agent or nutraceutical (531). Along withits diuretic properties, T. indica may induce vasodilation, as itsseed coat flavonoids are found in Pycnogenol\u00ae, a supplementknown for its vasorelaxant effects (532). The plant\u2019s effect mightalso be due to its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiobesity,antilipidemic, anti-HC, cardioprotective, antiproliferative, anti-DM, and hepatoprotective properties (526, 527, 532\u2013535).Thymus schimperi is a plant endemic to Ethiopia (23), where itis used both in TM and as a food flavoring (536). It is commonlyused by Ethiopian patients to manage HTN (57, 59, 65, 69, 75, 87,92, 99, 101, 104, 107\u2013109). T. schimperi has shown a relaxing effecton thoracic aortas by blocking ROCCs and VDCCs and activatingK+ ATP-channels, H1, and M3-receptors (23). Both the leaves andessential oil of the plant possess anti-HTN and diureticproperties, likely due to the high K or phenolic content. TheK may promote endothelium-dependent vasodilation (54). T.schimperi has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-DM activity(537, 538).The Ethiopian endemic plant Thymus serrulatus is traditionallyused both as a food ingredient and as a remedy for various healthconditions. In Ethiopian TM, its decoction is used to manage highBP and DM (109, 110). This species is frequently added to tea,coffee, and various stews for flavor (539). T. serrulatus has beenfound to have a vasodilatory effect that depends on theendothelium linked to the activation of the cGMP-NO pathway(540). Thyme species are commonly recognized for their diureticproperties worldwide, and T. serrulatus has shown significantdiuretic effects (30). Extracts and essential oil from its aerialparts exhibit antihyperglycemic properties, with phenoliccompounds enhancing blood glucose-lowering effects (539). Itsessential oil also demonstrated nephroprotective properties dueto its antioxidant and antiinflammatory actions (541).Trigonella foenum-graecum is native to regions spanning fromthe Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia and Ethiopia. It iscommonly used as a spice in food and as an ingredient in TM.In the Unani medical system, it is employed as a diuretic (542).In Ethiopia (57, 75) and Morocco (14), T. foenum-graecum istraditionally used to manage HTN. Studies have shown thatextracts from it have significant anti-HTN and anti-HC effects(5). The extract may lower BP by inhibiting the overexpressed5-HT2B receptors (543). In diabetic rats, fenugreek extract hasbeen found to enhance the relaxation response to Ach andpartially reduce the heightened contractile response ofendothelium-intact aortic rings to NE and/or KCl. These effectsare thought to be partly mediated by the PG synthesis pathway(544). Fenugreek seed flour promotes endothelium-dependentvasorelaxation at lower levels of Ach compared to diosgenin,indicating that other components of fenugreek may contribute toits beneficial effects. The plant has shown antioxidant and ACEIactivities (181, 545).Gelatinous capsules containing fenugreek extract showed onlymild diuretic effects in patients with cirrhotic ascites (546).However, fenugreek extracts demonstrated effective diuretic andnatriuretic activity in rats. The increased excretion of Na+ andK+ by the water extract is an important feature of a gooddiuretic, as it reduces the risk of hyperkalemia (547). T. foenum-graecum also possesses antiinflammatory, anti-DM,hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective activities (542).Vernonia amygdalina, native to tropical Africa, is commonlyknown as \u201cbitter leaf\u201d due to its distinct bitter flavor, attributedto its anti-nutritional components such as alkaloids, saponins,tannins, and glycosides. However, the bitterness can be reducedby boiling or soaking the leaves in water. The leaves are widelyused in various African dishes (548\u201350). Traditionally, the plantis used to treat HTN in Ethiopia (57), Togo (551), Nigeria (229),and Uganda (552). In Malaysia, it is known for treating DM andHTN (553). Leaf extracts of V. amygdalina have been shown toreduce heart contractility force and rate in isolated rabbit hearts,similar to the effects of Ach, indicating the presence of activecompounds and minerals (552). The plant also significantlylowers BP, HR, and blood volume while enhancing antioxidantactivity (554, 555).V. amygdalina leaves affected BP in rats in a biphasic manner,suggesting the presence of multiple compounds in the extract thatinfluence BP. When the extract was added to the pre-contractedaortic rings in rats, it induced SM relaxation in the aorta(556\u2013558). The primary pathway responsible for the plant\u2019svasorelaxant effects involves EDRFs like PGI2 and the NO/cGMPpathway. This is followed by opening K+ -channels and activatingendothelium-independent relaxing factors through M3- and \u03b22-receptors. The extract also reduced vasoconstriction by inhibitingthe intracellular release of Ca2+ through the IP3-receptor.Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identifiedalkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins in the extract (558). V.amygdalina exhibits diuretic effects in rats, likely due to itsimpact on renal Na+ handling and interaction with the adenosineA1-receptor (47). Various studies have highlighted its bioactivecomponents and their antiinflammatory, anti-DM, antiobesity,and hepatoprotective properties (550).Zingiber officinale, native to southern China, is widely used as aspice and flavoring agent in cuisines around the world. Theessential oils extracted from ginger rhizomes, containing botharomatic and pungent compounds, are used to preserve food bypreventing autoxidation and microbial spoilage (559\u2013561). InTM, ginger is used to treat HTN in Ethiopia (57, 84), IndonesiaNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 37 frontiersin.org(562), Palestine (171), Senegal (280), and Nigeria (229). InPakistan, herbalists recommend HTN patients consume gingerafter dinner (563). According to Ayurvedic principles, gingerhelps clear blockages in blood vessels (564).Healthy individuals who consumed Z. officinale rhizomeexperienced a significant decrease in BP and HR. It wassuggested that ginger improves blood flow to the peripheralblood vessels, indicating a reduction in vascular resistance. As aresult, Z. officinale lowers PVR and consequently reduces arterialBP (560, 565). A pooled analysis of clinical trials found thatginger supplements could reduce SBP by 6.36 mmHg and DBPby 2.12 mmHg (566). Another systematic review and meta-analysis showed significant reductions in fasting blood sugar(FBS), HbA1C, SBP, and DBP in patients with T2DM afterginger supplementation (567).The rhizome extract of Z. officinale and its fractionssignificantly lowered BP in hypertensive rats. Rx with the extractshifted the cumulative CRC of serotonin (5-HT) to the right inthe rat fundus, indicating antagonism of the 5-HT2B receptor(568). Ginger rhizome also showed hypotensive effects in rats,possibly through negative inotropic and chronotropic effects andendothelium-independent vasodilation by blocking VDCCs (563,569). The anti-HTN effects of ginger rhizome extracts in ratsinvolve mechanisms such as NO and PGI2 release, activation ofcGMP\u2012K+ ATP-channels, stimulation of muscarinic receptors, andCa2+-release from intracellular stores via transmembrane CCs(570, 571). Ginger helps lower SBP and serum solubleintercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels (562). Z.officinale extract also induced endothelium-dependentvasorelaxation and enhanced vascular protection against ECdamage using its antioxidant properties. Overall, the plant extractexerts significant vasodilatory, vasoprotective, and free radical-scavenging effects (2).White and red ginger demonstrated notable ACEI activity inrats and also showed anti-HC effects due to this ACEI activity.Ang-II disrupts the binding of LDLC to its receptors andincreases endothelial uptake of LDL. Using ACEIs can counteractthese negative effects and may reduce the risk of MI associatedwith high plasma levels of ang-II. Thus, both types of gingercould be used as nutraceuticals for treating HTN and otherCVDs (34, 181, 572). Moreover, ginger demonstrated diureticeffects comparable to furosemide (573) and potentially aseffective as K-sparing diuretics (574). Accumulating evidencesupports various pharmacological effects of ginger and itsderivatives, including antiinflammatory, antiobesity, anti-DM,antiproliferative, antithrombotic, cardioprotective, andhepatoprotective properties (561, 575, 576).In summary, the importance of traditional medical practicesand indigenous knowledge in treating HTN is underscored bythe experimentally confirmed anti-HTN properties of MPs fromvarious regions. The pharmacological effects of these anti-HTNplants are closely aligned with traditional herbal formulations.Before advancing to clinical trials, further studies on themechanism of action and anti-HTN activity of extracts andsecondary metabolites from plants such as A. hispidum, A.aspera, A. remota, C. aurea, C. aurantium, C. aurantiifolia, C.limon, C. medica, C. grandis, C. citratus, F. vulgare, H. vulgare, J.curcas, L. leucocephala, L. albus, M. azedarach, M. spicata, O.integrifolia, R. officinalis, R. chalepensis, S. punctata, S. molle, S.nigrum, S. guineense, T. schimperi, T. serrulatus, and T. foenum-graecum are recommended. Additional preclinical studiesfocusing on the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, andanti-HTN effects of C. lantus, C. limon, M. piperita, and T.indica are also advised. While in vitro and ex vivo or in vivostudies have been conducted on extracts of C. sativum, L.usitatissimum, P. edulis, and Z. officinale, more clinical researchis needed. Similarly, although preclinical investigations have beencarried out on A. cepa, M. stenopetala, P. americana, and V.amygdalina, clinical studies have only been performed on A.cepa. Extensive animal and human studies have been conductedon medicinal preparations of A. sativum, H. sabdariffa, M.oleifera, and N. sativa. Consequently, A. cepa, A. sativum, H.sabdariffa, M. oleifera, and N. sativa are promising candidates fordeveloping standardized natural products, nutraceuticals, or anti-HTN agents.5.3 Phytochemistry of medicinal plants withantihypertensive activitySince ancient times, MPs have been used as a source of Rx.Globally, around 35,000\u201370,000 plant species are employed formedicinal purposes. The modern pharmaceutical industry isincreasingly looking to traditionally used MPs to counteract theeffects of synthetic drugs at the cellular level. These plants arerich in phytochemicals, which have played a key role in thedevelopment of many modern medicines (577). Phytochemicalsconsist of both primary and secondary metabolites (212). Thesecondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides,phenols, phlobatannins, tannins, terpenoids, and volatile oils,enhance the therapeutic purpose of plants for treating a widerange of diseases (577). Flavonoids, a large group of polyphenoliccompounds found in commonly consumed foods like fruits andvegetables, are divided into subgroups based on their chemicalstructure: flavones, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanidins, andchalcones (48). Polyphenolic compounds include anthocyanins,flavonoids, phenolic acids, and phenolic diterpenes (531).Various phenolic compounds present in plants includebenzoquinones, polypropenol, isoflavonoids, flavonol derivatives(such as carotenoids and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin epoxide),phenylpropanoids, phenolic quinones, lignins, melanins, tannins,and more (149). Research has shown that polyphenols offerseveral biological and therapeutic benefits, including antioxidant,anti-AS, and antiinflammatory properties, useful in treatinghuman diseases (323). Natural polyphenols, widely used in thefunctional food industry, have been shown to protect againstCVD, DM, and HTN by inhibiting key enzymes like ACE, \u03b1-glucosidase, and \u03b1-amylase, increasing NO levels, and improvingEF (373).The secondary metabolites found in the ethanol-solublefractions of A. hispidum with hypotensive and anti-HTN effectsinclude phenolic compounds like caffeoylquinic acids,Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 38 frontiersin.orgdicaffeoylquinic acids, and glycosylated flavonoids (quercetinglucoside and galactoside). Derivatives of caffeoylquinic anddicaffeoylquinic acids, such as chlorogenic acid (Figure 5), arewell-absorbed in the intestines and can be easily detected inhuman plasma. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies haveshown that chlorogenic acid (1) is an effective hypotensive andanti-HTN agent. It helps reduce OS and increases NObioavailability, which improves EF and lowers overall PVR (137).Mannitol, extracted from the aerial parts of A. hispidum (156),may contribute to the plant\u2019s saluretic activity.Saponins extracted from A. aspera showed diuretic effects inrats (578). These compounds need structural elucidation toidentify the active components. Another active compoundresponsible for the plant\u2019s diuretic and antiinflammatory effectsis achyranthine, which is included in the polyherbal diureticformulation Cystone\u00ae (159, 160). Achyranthine (2), a water-soluble alkaloid, was also found to lower BP and HR, as well asdilate blood vessels, in animal studies (579). Thepharmacological activity of A. aspera is attributed to its diversephytochemical constituents, particularly oleanolic acid,achyranthine, and ecdysterone (577). The key compounds inthe plant, including flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, andalkaloids, may have contributed to the diuretic effects observedin Ajuga remota (164).The hypotensive effects of A. cepa (onion) peel extract may beattributed to its quercetin content (179). Most of the quercetin inonions is in a glucoside form, which is highly absorbable. A. cepaexhibits antioxidant properties due to the presence oforganosulfur compounds (such as S-propenylcysteine sulfoxide,the major component, along with S-propylcysteine sulfoxide andS-methylcysteine sulfoxide), polyphenols, and flavonoids. In rats,dietary flavonoids like quercetin and catechin were shown toreduce lipid peroxidation. Quercetin (3), a polyphenol, isresponsible for the anti-HTN and vasorelaxant effects of onions(175, 178). Studies have shown that rutin and quercetin loweredBP in animals (174). Quercetin also reduced high BP, cardiacand renal hypertrophy, and vascular changes in SHR rats (580).Additionally, onion peel, rich in quercetin and FRS 1,000, hasbeen found to strongly inhibit PDE 5A activity (179).A. cepa may exert its hypotensive effect by inhibiting ACEthrough one or more of its flavonoid constituents, such asquercetin (174). Quercetin could lower BP by improving vascularEF. This hypothesis is supported by several findings: (a) innormotensive humans, quercetin increased plasma quercetin andNO metabolite levels while reducing ET-1; (b) in hypertensiverats, quercetin reduced VD in a NO-dependent manner; and (c)in vitro studies showed that quercetin decreased cellularproduction of ET-1 and endothelial adhesion molecules (175). A.cepa contains metabolites like potassic salts, alkaloids, cardiacglycosides, steroids, and triterpenoidal saponins, which maycontribute to its diuretic effects (32, 173). Anthocyanins andS-methyl cysteine sulfoxide from onions help lower serumcholesterol, TGs, and phospholipids in rats (174). Dietary nitrateand nitrite from onions may also have physiological effects,contributing to increased urinary nitrate and nitrite, while dietaryarginine from onions may boost NO levels (178).Components of A. sativum (garlic), including S-allyl-L-cysteine(4), alliin (5), allyl disulfide (6), and diallyl trisulfide (7), have beenshown to lower BP in both rats and hypertensive patients (184, 192,200). Allicin (8) reduced BP and TG levels in SHR rats (581). Thiscompound can induce vasorelaxation in rat arteries, likely throughgarlic\u2019s ability to activate NO formation (201). S-allyl cysteine fromgarlic enhances eNOS activity and increases cGMP levels (582),while diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide promote eNOSactivity, protect against eNOS degradation, and elevate both NOand cGMP levels. Diallyl trisulfide also boosts H2S levels (583,584). Allicin in garlic inhibits Ang-II activity (191), and variousorganosulfur compounds from garlic disrupt cholesterolbiosynthesis (210). Aged garlic extract has demonstrated radical-scavenging properties due to the presence of S-allyl-L-cysteineand S-allylmercapto-L-cysteine (201). S-allyl cysteine triggers anantioxidant response by activating the nuclear factor-erythroid 2related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways (585). N-acetylcysteine,a water-soluble chemical, reduces LDL oxidation and OS, andimproves GT and lipid profiles in rats (51).The ACEI activity of A. sativum is attributed to the presence of\u03b3-glutamyl-allyl-cysteine sulfoxide and other glutamyl peptides ingarlic (205). Compounds like S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide andmethiin have displayed anti-DM properties (190). Alliinpossesses anti-DM, anti-HC, and antiinflammatory effects (586).Nonsulfur compounds such as saponins may also contribute togarlic\u2019s key biological activities. Quercetin significantly reducedthe rise in BP in rats. This compound\u2019s effect is likely due to itsability to enhance NO availability by boosting NOS activity andexhibiting antioxidant properties (587).A. sativum contains several active components that contributeto its hypotensive properties, including adenosine, arginine,ascorbic acid, Ca, Mg, K, quercetin, tryptophan, and tyrosinase.The increase in GFR caused by A. sativum extract may be due toseveral factors: (a) triterpenoidal saponins interacting withglomerular membrane components, influencing fluid filtration;(b) reduced renal perfusion pressure, likely from decreasedresistance in the afferent arteriole or increased resistance in theefferent arteriole; (c) a direct effect on arterial pressure, as garlicis known to relax vascular SMs, causing vasodilation\u2014this maybe due to the breakdown of garlic-derived polysulfides into H\u2082Sin RBCs, a reaction dependent on reduced thiols in or on theRBC membrane; and (d) inhibition of Na+/K+ -ATPase activity,leading to reduced Na+ transport in the glomerulus because Na+reabsorption in the tubules typically requires active Na+/K+ -ATPase. The diuretic effect of the n-butanol extract of A.sativum could result from one or more of garlic\u2019sphytocompounds. Sesquiterpene lactones and triterpenes areknown to have diuretic and saluretic effects (208).The antioxidant metabolites in C. aurea seeds, includingflavonoids, tannins, and phenolic compounds, are likelyresponsible for the plant\u2019s anti-HTN effects (211\u2013213). Papaya isnow recognized as a nutraceutical fruit due to its wide range ofhealth benefits and is favored for weight loss due to its lowcalorie content compared to other commercial fruits (215, 216).C. lanatus seeds also exhibit ant-HTN properties, attributed totheir nutrient content, such as Mg, K, and Ca (225). TheNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 39 frontiersin.orgphenolic compounds in watermelon, including flavonoids,carotenoids, and triterpenoids, offer antiinflammatory andantioxidant benefits. Watermelon is rich in lycopene and \u03b2-carotene, which have antioxidant, antiinflammatory, andhypotensive properties. Beta-carotene is significant in reducingthe risk of T2DM and lowering the chances of MS (224, 235).The key bioactive components in C. aurantium fruits includephenethylamine alkaloids such as octopamine, synephrine,tyramine, N-methyltyramine, and hordenine. These fruits arealso abundant in flavonoids, including hesperidin, neohesperidin,naringenin, naringin, and rutin, which offer various benefits,such as antiinflammatory effects. Essential oils like linalool andlimonene contribute to anti-anxiety effects. Citrus fruits areamong the best sources of pectin, a type of fiber known forlowering cholesterol and stabilizing blood sugar levels. Pectin alsocontains growth factor antagonists. Limonene enhancesantioxidant detoxification, and it reduces the activity of proteinsthat may lead to abnormal cell growth (239). Therefore, bothpectin and limonene may aid in BP management through theircholesterol-lowering, anti-DM, and antiproliferative properties.The health benefits of C. aurantiifolia are linked to itsphytochemicals, which include limonoids, carotenoids, minerals,and vitamins. The extracts of C. aurantiifolia contain flavonoidssuch as rutin, hesperidin, didymin, hesperetin, apigenin,quercetin, kaempferol, nobiletin, and neohesperidin. Theseflavonoids exhibit hypotensive, vasorelaxant, andantiinflammatory effects. Carotenoids offer protection againstsevere conditions like heart disease and function as antioxidantswhile regulating the immune system (239, 588). The vasorelaxanteffect, which increases cGMP and cAMP by inhibiting vascularPDEs, can be attributed to its naringenin content (589). Thereduction of HTN by citrus leaves may be due to theirpolyphenol content, especially flavonoids with antioxidant andACEI activities, such as diosmin, isoquercitrin, hesperidin,eriocitrin, neocriocitrin, narirutin, and 7-OH flavonone (237).C. limon is a valuable source of nutritional supplements,containing a variety of phytochemicals including tannins,terpenes, polyphenols, and carotenoids (13, 590). In studies withrats, both crude flavonoids and fraction B from lemonssignificantly reduced SBP. These extracts were rich in flavonoidglycosides such as eriocitrin (9), hesperidin, and 6, 8-di-C-\u03b2-glucosyldiosmin. Both the crude flavonoids and the flavonoidglycosides demonstrated ACEI effects, with hesperidin (10)showing particularly strong inhibition. Additionally, flavonoidglycosides from lemon peel have been noted for theirhypotensive effects (249).The antioxidant effects of C. limon are linked to the presence ofhesperidin, eriocitrin, and auraptene. Hesperidin can preventincreases in BP by promoting NO-mediated vasodilation (249).Hesperidin can enhance EF during HTN. It also affects vascularpermeability, boosts capillary resistance, and has anti-inflammatoryproperties (591, 592). Regular consumption of eriocitrin inhypertensive rats has been shown to improve vascular EF.Flavonoids from lemon juice residue help reduce proteinuria inchronic high BP. Long-term administration of auraptene tohypertensive rats also led to a significant reduction in BP (249).The diuretic properties of C. limon juice may be attributed toits components quercitrin and iso-quercitrin (11) because both ofthese compounds exhibited diuretic effects (13). Diosmetin (12),a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, lemon peel, and R. officinalis,has demonstrated anti-HTN effects in rats. Diosmetin\u2019s potentialto lower BP is evident from its CC antagonism, activation of K+ -channels, and vasodilatory effects (593). Hesperidin and diosminare known to reduce hepatotoxicity, minimize OS, and lowerblood sugar and cholesterol levels (251).The beneficial effects of C. medica are due not only to itshealth-promoting macronutrients and micronutrients but also toits specialized metabolites. These include flavonoids (apigenin,hesperetin, hesperidin, naringin, naringenin, rutin, quercetin, anddiosmin), coumarins (citropten, scoparone, and bergapten),terpenes (limonene, \u03b3-terpinene, limonin, and nomilin), andphenolic acids (p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, andchlorogenic acid) (258). The plant\u2019s diuretic effects may be linkedto dasycarpidan-1-methanol, acetate (ester), which demonstrateda strong binding affinity to PLA2 inhibitors in a moleculardocking study (257).The extracts from the leaves and aerial parts of C. grandiscontain various compounds, including cephalandrol,cephalandrine A, cephalandrine B, \u03b2-sitosterol, triacontane, rutin,quercetin-3-O-neohesperidoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside,kaempferol-3-O-neohesperidoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside,kaempferol-hexoside, oleuropein, and ligstroside (261). Thepurified polyphenolic fraction from the immature fruit extract ofC. grandis has demonstrated ACEI activity. This extract yieldedeight distinct polyphenols, including hydroxyl ferulic acid,apigenin, isorhamnetin-O-sophoroside, and isoscutellarein-O-pentoside (265).The flavonoid fraction of C. sativum leaves exhibited anti-lipidemic properties. It also effectively prevented serum NO levelreduction in rats, suggesting its potential as an anti-HTN andcardioprotective agent. This supports its use in TM andhighlights its potential for development as an anti-HTN drug(274). The flavonoid-rich fraction of C. sativum also displayedACEI activity. This fraction included a range of flavonoids suchas apigenin, pinocembrin, pseudobaptigenin, galangin-5-methylether, quercetin, baicalein trimethyl ether, kaempferol dimethylether, pinobanksin-5-methylether-3-O-acetate, pinobanksin-3-O-phenylpropionate, pinobanksin-3-O-pentanoate, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-glucuronide, apigenin-3-O-rutinoside,rutin, quercetin dimethyl ether-3-O-rutinoside, luteolin, daidzein,pectolinarigenin, and apigenin-C-glucoside (594). The diureticeffect of this plant is attributed to its flavonoids, glycosides, andsaponins (272). Identifying and characterizing the activecompounds in these metabolites is essential. The majorpolyphenolics in coriander aerial parts, such as caffeic acid,protocatechuic acid, and glycitin, are primarily responsible forthe plant\u2019s antioxidant activity (269).The phenolic acids in C. macrostachyus exhibit antioxidanteffects (277). The plant\u2019s saponins, tannins, and terpenoids maycontribute to its diuretic effects by impacting kidney function.Flavonoids and saponins are believed to drive the diureticactivity of the plant by inducing vasodilation in the afferentNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 40 frontiersin.orgarterioles of the renal system, which increases the GFR andsubsequently enhances urine production (275). The anti-HTNeffect of C. macrostachyus could also be attributed to itsditerpene compounds (277), which have been shown to havevasorelaxant effects when isolated from Croton zambesicus (595).The leaves of C. citratus contain essential oils, with citral beingthe primary component. Citral (13) has been shown to produce anendothelium-independent vasorelaxant effect, likely by influencingintracellular Ca2+ levels and partially through NO pathways (596).Both citral and C. citratus leaf extracts exhibit spasmolyticproperties and may function as Ca2+-antagonists (597). Citral hasa negative chronotropic effect, likely due to enhanced PNSactivity (598). Citral also demonstrates antiproliferative effects(288). It has potential as a novel anti-HTN agent due to itsmultiple mechanisms of action. Flavonoid and tannin fractionsfrom C. citratus have shown vasorelaxant effects on humanarteries (284). These substances, along with electrolytes, mayhave both indirect and direct vasodilatory effects and exhibitCCB properties (45). Therefore, isolating, characterizing, andevaluating the efficacy and safety of these compounds is essential.The antioxidant activity of lemongrass is likely attributed to itsflavonoids, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, and vitamin C. Theelectrolyte contents of lemongrass, including K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+,may contribute to BP reduction through several mechanisms. Forinstance, K+ helps lower BP by causing vasodilation in SM cells,while Mg2+ is thought to lower BP by influencing vascular toneand reactivity. This effect is achieved through changes in theinteractions between cellular Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vascular SM cells,which enhances EF. Mg2+ competes with Ca2+ for binding siteson membranes, reducing intracellular Ca2+ levels and promotingvasodilation. Mg2+ and K+ might replace Na+, contributingfurther to their hypotensive effects. Therefore, the diuretic,natriuretic, and saluretic actions leading to BP reduction mayresult from the combined effects of these electrolytes and otheractive components in lemongrass. ACEI peptides fromlemongrass could also serve as potential modulators of BP (45).The phytochemicals found in C. citratus, including alkaloids,tannins, saponins, flavonoids, and phenolics, promote diuresis andnatriuresis either individually or through synergistic effects byinhibiting the Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporter (NKCC). The minorchanges in estimated GFR observed with the extract are similar tothose seen with furosemide Rx, supporting the idea that theirmechanisms of action are comparable. This co-transporter plays arole in transporting adenosine across the macula densa cellmembrane, which is involved in the tubuloglomerular feedbackmechanism that maintains volume homeostasis. This actionprevents the expected vasoconstriction that might occur withdiuretic administration, leading to vasodilation, reduced resistancein the afferent arterioles, and only minor changes in estimatedGFR. Saponins\u2019 inhibition of aldosterone-sensitive Na+ -channelsin the cortical collecting tubules suggests they have diureticproperties similar to spironolactone. The flavonoid quercetininhibited the expression of \u03b1ENaC-mRNA in the kidney (281).Therefore, further research on these compounds, including theirisolation, structural elucidation, and characterization, is needed toevaluate their efficacy and safety.The interplay between the furosemide-like and spironolactone-like diuretic mechanisms of C. citratus phytochemicals could partlyexplain the minor changes observed in serum K+ levels and themodest kaliuresis. The diuretic effect of C. citratus may also beinfluenced by its high K content, which could contribute to theincreased serum K+ during the acute phase. Research has shownthat serum K+ can act as a competitive inhibitor of the Na+/K+ -ATPase pump, and the pump\u2019s Na+ efflux is inversely related toserum K+ levels. The elevated K in C. citratus extract mightinduce diuresis similar to saponins and other phytochemicals,which are known to inhibit Na+/K+ -ATPase and are present inC. citratus (581).The phenolic compounds found in F. vulgare exhibit ACEIactivity and anti-DM effects (290). These molecules are linked tothe prevention of diseases caused by OS. Fennel is known tocontain derivatives of hydroxyl cinnamic acid, flavonoidglycosides, and flavonoid aglycones. Additional phenoliccompounds identified in fennel include chlorogenic acid, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinicacid, 1,3-O-di-caffeoylquinic acid, 1,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid,1,5-O-di-caffeoylquinic acid, and 3\u2019,8\u2019-binaringenin (293).The polyphenol extract from H. sabdariffa calyx has shownvasorelaxation effects (296). Hibiscus acid (14), derived from H.sabdariffa calyxes, induces vasorelaxation regardless ofendothelium presence. Similarly, garcinia acid (15), adiastereoisomer of hibiscus acid, exhibits almost identicalvasorelaxant properties. Both compounds likely achieve this byinhibiting Ca\u00b2+ influx by blocking VGCCs (310). Theanthocyanins, delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside (16) and cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside (17), have demonstrated competitive ACEIactivity (316). Quercetin glycosides from the plant may also serveas potential Rxs for HTN and CHF. Quercetin has been found tolower BP in hypertensive rats through ACEI activity and byimproving EF. Tannins have also been proven to inhibit ACE(599), suggesting the need for bioassay-guided identification andcharacterization of its compounds. Components such as4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, gallic acid, andcyanidin-3-sambubioside could contribute to anti-HTN effectsthrough different mechanisms (295). The antioxidant propertiesof H. sabdariffa are likely linked to its polyphenolic content(315), and its anti-HTN and cardioprotective effects may stemfrom the presence of phenolic compounds. The plant\u2019s medicinaleffects may also be due to its vitamins and minerals (294).The reduction in Ang-II levels caused by ACEI from H.sabdariffa leads to decreased genetic expression of \u03b1ENaC. Thediuretic effect of sour tea and 5AN:5M water extract occursthrough reduced \u03b1ENaC expression, likely due to the presence offlavonoids, as quercetin significantly lowers \u03b1ENaC expression.In kidney cells, trans-epithelial Na+ hypotonicity stimulates Na+reabsorption by increasing \u03b1ENaC subunit mRNA expressionand decreasing intracellular Cl\u2212 concentration. Quercetin, byactivating the NKCC, raises cytosolic Cl\u2212 concentration,suppressing \u03b1ENaC subunit mRNA expression (600). H.sabdariffa and ACEI have nephroprotective effects, slowing renalinsufficiency progression. The increase in creatinine clearance inthe H. sabdariffa-treated group is largely due to anthocyanins,Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 41 frontiersin.orgwhich raise GFR by inhibiting Ang-II production. Vasodilatorycompounds in sour tea, like eugenol and quercetin, may enhancecreatinine clearance by improving renal blood flow andincreasing GFR (299).The barley and malt extracts of H. vulgare contain polyphenolssuch as catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, procyanidin C2,procyanidin B3, and prodelphinidin B3, along with tocopherols(\u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b3) and carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin), all ofwhich possess antioxidant properties (601). Other polyphenolsisolated from methanolic barley seedling extract, includinglutonarin, 3-O-feruloylquinic acid, saponarin, orientin,isoorientin, isovitexin, and various glucoside derivatives, showedACEI activity. Among these, isoorientin (18) showed ACEIpotential (323).Gramine (19), a non-terpenoid alkaloid primarily found in thePoaceae family, including H. vulgare, induces vasorelaxationsimilar to ketanserin, acting mainly by inhibiting 5-HT2Areceptors (602). Thus, gramine functions as a vasorelaxant. Onthe other hand, hordenine, another alkaloid from H. vulgare, cancause HTN as it acts as a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)inhibitor, increasing NE levels. Therefore, further research isneeded to fully explore this plant\u2019s potential for anti-HTN effects(603). The plant\u2019s antihyperglycemic properties may be due to itsantioxidant-rich minerals and fibre-rich carbohydrates, whichslow glucose absorption, aligning insulin release with peak bloodsugar levels (325). Saponarin, a powerful antioxidant flavonoidfound in young green barley leaves, has shown potential fortreating oxidative and inflammatory conditions and may alsohave antiobesity effects (604, 605). The high dietary fibrecontent, including \u03b2-glucan, in barley can reduce the risk ofCHD (325).Flavonoid compounds such as isorhamnetin, chrysoeriol,luteolin-7-glucoside, isorhamnetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-rubinoside, and caffeic acid,extracted from the aerial parts of L. leucocephala, have shownsignificant antioxidant activity (606). Quercetin, quercetin-3-O-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-\u03b1-arabinofuranose, luteolin,myricetin, 3\u2019,4\u2019,7-trihydroxyflavone, and myricetin-3-O-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside, identified from the plant\u2019s foliage, exhibitedstronger antioxidant properties (336). The fatty acids (FAs)hexadecenoic acid and oleic acid isolated from L. leucocephalawere found to function as \u03b1-amylase inhibitors (340).The main components found in different parts of L.leucocephala include 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester; 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, methyl ester(Z,Z,Z); betamethasone; \u03b2-sitosterol; androstan-17-one; 3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5a)-; 3-beta-hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid;stigmasterol; ampesterol; 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctylester; lupeol; betulin; and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z), methylester. Other isolated compounds from this plant includesqualene, astaxanthin, tetratetracontane, (cyclohexane,1,3,5-trimethyl-2-octadecyl-), oleanolic acid, ethane 1,1-diethoxy,(hexadecanoic acid, 1-(hydroxymethyl)-1,2-ethanediyl ester),(octadecanoic acid 2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediyl ester), oleic acid3-(octadecyloxy)propyl ester, n-hexadecanoic acid, stearic acid3-propanediyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, vitamin E,O-methyl-d-glucose, and 7,10-octadecadienoic acid, methyl ester.Most of these compounds are reported to have significantbiological properties, such as antiinflammatory, anti-HC, andanti-DM effects (607).The anti-HTN activity of L. usitatissimum may be linked to itspolar compounds, such as quercetin, nicotinic acid, andnicotinamide (355). Four key components in flaxseed\u2014\u03b1-linolenic acid, lignans, fiber, and peptides, or possibly theircombined effect\u2014may contribute to its BP-lowering properties.The antiinflammatory action of \u03b1-linolenic acid could explain itsanti-HTN effect, while lignans may reduce BP due to theirantioxidant properties (348). Omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseed alsohave antithrombotic, vasodilatory, and antiatherogenic properties,benefiting lipid metabolism (608). In older adults, a significantreduction in DBP was noted after six months of consuming alignan complex (609). The lignan metabolites enterolactone(ENL) and enterodiol, produced by gut microbiota, are likelyresponsible for the effect on DBP, with END also linked to SBP(348). Flaxseed peptides have been found to inhibit ACE (354).Some oxylipins derived from arachidonic or linoleic acids havebeen linked to inflammation, tissue damage, vasoconstriction, andOS. In contrast, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), produced fromarachidonic acid, act as EDHFs associated with natriuresis andeNOS-activated vasodilation. The enzyme soluble epoxidehydrolase (SEH) rapidly converts EETs intodihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which reducevasodilation. SEH also metabolizes epoxyoctadecenoic acids intodihydroxyoctadecenoic acids, which are cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory. Inhibiting SEH has been effectively used to lowerBP, reduce HTN-related kidney damage, and minimize infarctionsize in animal models. It is hypothesized that the \u03b1-linolenic acidin L. usitatissimum (flaxseed) may inhibit SEH, contributing toits anti-HTN effects (351). Studies suggest that higher omega-6fatty acid levels in human adipose tissue are linked to lower BP,while omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseed regulate gene expression,reduce serum TGs, and modify CV risk factors. Lignans, such assecoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) (20), found primarily asglucosides in food like flaxseed, act as antioxidants (345). SDG, along-acting compound, has been shown to lower BP innormotensive rats, likely due to its stimulation of GC activity (610).Lupine seeds contain high levels of polyphenols, carotenoids,phytosterols, tocopherols, alkaloids, and peptides that possessanti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (611). A patent hasbeen issued for the use of \u03b3-conglutin, a protein from lupineseeds, in the Rx of T2DM due to its ability to interact withinsulin and mimic its effects (612). L. albus roots and noduleswere found to synthesize NO and L- (14C)-citrulline. Regularconsumption of bread enriched with lupine lowers BP, andlupine protein has been shown to reduce the risk of HTN andimprove VF in rats. This effect may be related to compounds likepolyphenols, proteins, or L-arginine in lupine. Administeringlupine protein isolate to rats led to a decrease in SBP by18.6 mmHg compared to the control group. IncreasingL-arginine intake, which is abundant in lupine protein, canenhance NO levels and support BP reduction. Therefore, lupineprotein may aid in lowering BP by affecting NO metabolism (12).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 42 frontiersin.orgQuercetin-3-O-neohesperidoside, rutin, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside were identified as key contributors to theantioxidant properties of M. azedarach leaves, pulps, and kernels(366). Chemical analysis of the aerial parts of M. piperita, whichexhibited antioxidant and antiurolithiatic properties, revealed thepresence of phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, saponins,tannins, and terpenes (378). A total of 20 compounds wereidentified in the essential oil of M. piperita, which showedantispasmodic activity. The primary components includedmenthol, menthone, methyl acetate, isomenthol, isomenthone, \u03f5-caryophyllene, neo-isomenthol, and pulegone (372). Phenoliccompounds such as caffeic acid, eriocitrin, rosmarinic acid, andluteolin derivatives found in peppermint extract exhibited ACEIactivities, with eriocitrin identified as the main phenoliccompound responsible for these effects (373).M. spicata contains a wide range of bioactive metabolites,including a variety of phenolic chemicals. Its extracts are rich inhydroxycinnamic acids, such as ferulic acid, caftaric acid, p-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid, as well as caffeic acid andchlorogenic acid (384). The main phenolic compound inspearmint extract responsible for its ACEI effects has beenidentified as rosmarinic acid (21, 373).The total alkaloidal salts from M. oleifera showed negativeinotropic effects on the frog heart. Studies on their mechanismof action confirmed that these alkaloidal salts exhibit CCBactivity, warranting further research, structural elucidation, andcharacterization of the active compounds (613). Two flavonoidglycosides, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (22) and quercetin-3-O-glucoside (23), isolated from M. oleifera leaf extract,demonstrated significant ACEI activity (400). Bioactive phenoliccompounds may interact with disulfide bridges on the enzymesurface, altering its structure and reducing ACE activity (391).Mustard oil glycosides (Niazinin A (24), Niazinin B (25),Niazimicin (26), and Niaziminin A + B) isolated from M. oleiferaexhibited hypotensive, spasmolytic, and negative inotropic andchronotropic effects (389). The ethanolic extract also showedhypotensive effects, leading to the isolation of two nitrileglycosides (niazirin and niazirinin) and three mustard oilglycosides, including one isothiocyanate (4-(4\u2019-O-acetyla-\u03b1-L-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isothiocyanate (27)) and twothiocarbamates (niaziminin A (28) and niaziminin B (29)).Among these, the three mustard oil glycosides demonstratedsimilar BP-lowering effects, while the nitriles did not, suggestingthe importance of amide and/or sulfur atoms for hypotensiveactivity. From the ethyl acetate fraction of M. oleifera, fourcompounds were isolated. Two of these, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (30) and \u03b2-sitosterol (31), exhibited promisinghypotensive effects in rats (614). Additionally,p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (32), the aglycone of \u03b1-L-rhamnosyloxybenzaldehyde from M. oleifera, caused a reductionin BP (394).The flavonoids, biophenols, and isothiocyanates in Moringaoffer beneficial effects in treating chronic diseases (387, 398).Compounds such as N, \u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl vincosamide andquercetin found in Moringa exhibit antioxidant,antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, which protectheart structure. These substances also promote vasorelaxationand protect the endothelium. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside,mahanine, and curcumin in the herbal extract significantlyreduce body weight, BMI, LDL, and increase HDL levels.Quercetin-3-glucoside and the fiber content in M. oleifera mayimprove GT by slowing glucose absorption and delaying gastricemptying. Phenolics, glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, syringic acid,gallic acid, and rutin may contribute to the leaves anti-DMactivity. Pure compounds from Moringa extract improve insulinsecretion in the pancreatic islets of mice. Four isolatedcompounds\u2014vanillin, fluorine opyrazine, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile\u2014have beenidentified and characterized (386). Phenolic acids like chlorogenicacid are known for their anti-DM, anti-DL, andantiinflammatory effects. The tannins in Moringa possess anti-AS, antiinflammatory, and antihepatotoxic properties, whilesaponins have hypolipidemic effects (615). Moringa leaves, richin tannins and flavonoids, can improve capillary resistance,venous tone, and collagen stability (391).Similar to M. oleifera, the anti-HTN and antihyperlipidemiceffects of M. stenopetala are likely due to the presence ofalkaloids and glycosides in its extracts. The main compounds inM. stenopetala leaves are flavonoids and phenolic compounds,which have potent antioxidant properties and are involved invarious bioactivities (18, 406). The seeds of M. stenopetalacontain glucosinolates, such as 4(\u03b1-L-rhamnosyloxy) benzylisothiocyanate, which have been shown to exhibit multiplebiological activities (616).The anti-HTN effect of N. sativa oil may be linked to its FAcontent (416), particularly due to linoleic and oleic acids.Similarly, the BP-lowering effect of olive oil is attributed to itshigh oleic acid content, which influences membrane lipidstructure and regulates G protein-mediated signaling, leading to areduction in BP. Another study found that dietary linoleic acidcaused a modest BP decrease in normotensive individuals, likelydue to its impact on ionic fluxes in vascular ECs. Thepolyphenol content of N. sativa oil is comparable to that of oliveoil, contributing to its BP-lowering effect. The antioxidant andACEI effects of polyphenols and flavonoids in N. sativa essentialoil support EF and vasorelaxation, further aiding in BPreduction (40).N. sativa seeds contain over 100 compounds, includingdihydrothymoquinone, thymoquinone, dithymoquinone, trans-anethole, thymol, and carvacrol, all of which have demonstratedantioxidant properties (417, 428). Two major components fromdethymoquinonated black seed volatile oils, \u03b1-pinene (33) andp-cymene (34), were found to lower arterial BP and inducebradycardia in rats, likely through the suppression of SNSoutflow at the vasomotor center in the medulla (425).Thymoquinone (35), a volatile oil component, reduced botharterial BP and HR, probably through central action in themedulla oblongata, involving activation of 5-HT and muscarinicmechanisms (426). This substance also helps prevent HTN andrenal damage due to its antioxidant effects (617). Its vasodilatoryeffect may be partially mediated by activation of K+ ATP-channelsand blocking of 5-HT, \u03b11-, and ET-receptors (618).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 43 frontiersin.orgThymoquinone is known for its ability to preserve kidneyfunction, prevent urinary stone formation, reduce crystalretention in kidney tissue, and promote their excretionthrough urine (432). It also exhibits cardioprotective effectsand has been shown to improve hyperlipidemia and MS indiabetic rats (411, 412). Carvacrol and thymol also serve ascardioprotective agents, with thymol helping to prevent CVcomplications by lowering LDL, TGs, and apoptotic proteinswhile raising HDL levels. Both thymoquinone and thymolpossess anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory properties.Thymoquinone, anethole, p-cymene, and the FAs in N. sativahave demonstrated anti-DM effects (411).In P. edulis fruit, the predominant antioxidants include vitaminC, \u03b2-carotene, and \u03b3-tocopherol (449). The anti-HTN effect of P.edulis may be attributed to its polyphenolic components, asluteolin extracted from the fruit significantly reduced SBP in rats.Flavonoids like luteolin (36) have vasodilatory effects, potentiallythrough PKC inhibition or reduced Ca2+ uptake. P. edulis leavescontain GABA, a known substance that lowers BP (445, 619).Two compounds, edulilic acid and an anthocyanin fraction,extracted from P. edulis also significantly reduced BP and HR inrats, with more pronounced effects than the whole extract. Thissuggests that the full extract might be less effective due tocompetitive inhibition for absorption or interference by othercomponents (446).The anti-HTN and anti-DM effects of P. edulis fruit peels arelikely due to the flavonoids orientin (37), isoorientin, and pectin(451). Orientin has a vasorelaxant effect (620), while isoorientinhelps lower BP, increase coronary flow, and reduce myocardialO2 consumption and coronary artery resistance (452). Pectincontributes to its hypoglycemic effects by lowering glucose levelsand improving GT (451). Insoluble fiber from P. edulis seeds alsoexhibits hypolipidemic properties (441). The ACEI activity maybe attributed to flavonoids such as schaftoside, isoschaftoside,and isovitexin (453). The two major polyphenolic compounds inpassion fruit seeds, piceatannol (38) and its dimer scirpusin B(39), showed antioxidant and vasorelaxant effects by promotingNO release from the endothelium, with scirpusin B being moreeffective than piceatannol (621). Piceatannol also demonstratedanti-DM and antiglycantic activities (438). Chrysin (40), aflavonoid in passion fruit (439), may contribute to the plant\u2019svasodilation effect (449, 451) through multiple signalingpathways (622). Chrysin isolated from Passiflora incarnatashowed antioxidant activity (623).The volatile (aromatic) compounds in passion fruit, including2-tridecanone, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid, 2-pentadecanone,hexadecanoic acid, 2-tridecanol, octadecanoic acid, andcaryophyllene oxide, exhibited antioxidant effects. Isoorientin,orientin, spinosin, vicenin-2, \u03b1-tocopherylquinone,polysaccharide, luteolin-8-C-\u03b2-digitoxopyranoside, and luteolin-8-C-\u03b2-boivinopyranoside possess antiinflammatory effects. P.edulis contains alkaloids such as harmidine, harmine, harmane,and harmol, with harmine displaying anti-inflammatoryactivities. Thirteen carotenoids, including violaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, neurosporene, lycopene, mutatocrome, \u03b2-citraurin,prolycopene, \u03b2-carotene, phytoene, neoxanthin, phytofluene, andantheraxanthin, have been identified in P. edulis fruits.Carotenoids are known for their health benefits, includingantiobesity and anti-DM effects (441).Steroid and triterpene glycosides in avocado are likelyresponsible for the plant\u2019s hypotensive effects (456). Tanninsfound in avocado extract exhibit vasorelaxant properties, most ofwhich are endothelium-dependent, similar to Ach. Thevasorelaxant actions of polyphenols, including tannins, are linkedto the inhibition of PKC and PDEs and/or reduced Ca2+ influx(43). Flavonoids and terpenoids were also detected in avocado,contributing to its ACEI activity (465). Further research isneeded to isolate, elucidate the structure, and characterize theseactive metabolites\u2014tannins, flavonoids, and steroid andtriterpene glycosides\u2014in avocado.The anti-HTN and diuretic effects of 70% ethanol leaf andnanoparticle extracts from P. americana may be attributed totheir quercetin content. Quercetin promotes diuresis byinhibiting Na+ and K+. It can block the conversion of Ang-I toAng-II, which increases OS by lowering antioxidant levels. TheK and Mg in the extract also contributed to its anti-HTNproperties. Both SBP and DBP were lowered as quercetinenhances NOS activity in ECs, stimulating the release of EDRFs,which cause vasodilation (466). Avocado extract boosts thesynthesis and release of EDRFs (461).Avocado fruit pulp contains up to 33% oil, primarily consistingof monounsaturated FAs, which are thought to influence the FAcomposition in cardiac and renal membranes and improve theabsorption of \u03b1/\u03b2-carotene and lutein. The oil and its FAcomponents are also credited with hepatoprotective effects (43).The ability of avocado to reduce cholesterol and LDL levels islinked to its high monounsaturated FA content, along with \u03b2-sitosterol, lycopene, and carotenoids like \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene,and tocopherols. \u03b2-sitosterol helps maintain healthy cholesterollevels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, while tocopherols actas natural antioxidants, preventing LDL-receptor oxidation andpromoting cholesterol uptake into tissues. Avocados also containthree times more glutathione than any other fruit (468). Someessential oils in P. americana, such as \u03b2-caryophyllene (41), haveshown hypotensive and vasodilatory properties (469).Chromatographic analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction of avocadoleaf extract identified 11 compounds, with 11-tetradecyn-1-olacetate, 8-hexadecenal, 14-methyl-(Z)-, and cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde being the most abundant, likely contributing tothe fraction\u2019s anti-HTN effects (463).Acetogenins, including persenone A and B, and (2R)-(12Z,15Z)-2-hydroxy-4-oxoheneicosa-12,15-dien-1-yl acetate,isolated from P. americana, exhibited antiinflammatoryproperties. Various phenolic compounds with antioxidant,hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, antiobesity, andantiinflammatory effects have been identified in avocado. Thesecompounds include gallic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid,4-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, ferulicacid, (-)-epicatechin, neochlorogenic acid, procyanidins,proanthocyanidins B1 and B2, an A-type trimer, scopoletin, and(E)-chlorogenic acid (also known as caffeylquinic acid,caffetannic acid, helianthic acid, and igasuric acid) (458).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 44 frontiersin.orgAlongside \u03b2-sitosterol, other phytosterols found in avocadopulp and oil include campesterol, stigmasterol, lanosterol,\u03945-avenasterol, and \u03947-sitosterol. Phytostanols present inavocado oil are cycloarthenol, campestanol, citrostadienol,cycloeucalenol, and 24-methylenecycloartanol. These phytosterolsand phytostanols lower cholesterol absorption in the intestines bycompeting with cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack, AS,thrombosis, and other CVDs. Chlorophyll and its derivatives,such as pheophytins and pheophorbide, exhibit antioxidant andantigenotoxic properties. Unlike many other fruits, avocado pulpcontains minimal sugar, making it suitable for individuals withDM. Avocados are rich in seven-carbon sugars, primarilyD-mannoheptulose and perseitol, with D-mannoheptuloseoffering protective effects against DM by mimicking caloricrestriction, which delays aging and related diseases (459). Thehigh levels of indigestible carbohydrates in avocados help preventDM and regulate cholesterol. Despite containing carbohydrates,avocados have a low glycemic index (458).The main compounds in rosemary include monoterpenes(such as 1,8-cineole [eucalyptol], camphor [ketone], \u03b1-pinene,borneol, \u03b2-pinene, limonene, p-cymene, verbenone [ketone], and\u03b2-caryophyllene [sesquiterpenes), diterpenes (including carnosicacid, carnosol, rosmarol, epirosmanol, isorosmanol, androsmaridifenol), triterpenes (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, betulin,\u03b1-amyrin, and \u03b2-amyrin), flavonoids (luteolin, apigenin,genkwanin, diosmetin, hispidulin, 5-hydroxy-7, 4\u2019-dimethoxy-flavone, and cirsimaritin), and phenolic acids (rosmarinic,chlorogenic, and caffeic acids) (624). Compounds likechlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, oleanolic acid, eugenol, and \u03b1-pinene have been confirmed to exhibit antioxidant properties.Caffeic acid, carnosic acid, oleanolic acid, rosmarinic acid,carnosol, luteolin, camphor, and eugenol have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects. The anti-inflammatory properties of R.officinalis are attributed to carnosic acid, carnosol, eucalyptol,eugenol, and luteolin. Carnosic acid, ursolic acid, camphor, andcarnosol have shown anti-DM activity in various studies, withcarnosic acid also displaying anti-lipidemic effects. Ursolic acidwas found to reduce weight gain and AS, while rosmarinic acidoffered protection against AS (470).From R. officinalis leaf extracts exhibiting vasodilatory effects,compounds such as rosmarinic acid, epirosmanol methyl ether,genkwanin, carnosol, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid-3-O-glucoside, and homoplantaginin were identified. Terpenoids likeepirosmanol methyl ether, carnosol, a carnosol isomer, augusticacid, and carnosic acid were suggested to contribute torosemary\u2019s vasorelaxant properties. The vasorelaxant effects ofcarnosic acid (42) and carnosol (43) were confirmed (471).While rosmarinic acid from R. officinalis did not exhibitvasorelaxant properties, its ester derivative, ethyl rosmarinate(44), induced vasorelaxation through an endothelium-independent mechanism, indicating that esterification ofrosmarinic acid may enhance its vasodilatory effects (625). Theanti-HTN effect of rosemary essential oil was linked to thepresence of compounds like 1,8-cineole, \u03b1-pinene, camphor,bornyl acetate, borneol, camphene, \u03b1-terpineol, limonene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, and \u03b2-myrcene (626).Research on R. abyssinicus, which demonstrated diureticeffects, identified anthraquinones, flavonoids, saponins, steroids,terpenoids, tannins, phenolic compounds, quinones, and cardiacglycosides as its key components (46, 478). Studies on otherplants have shown that flavonoids, sesquiterpene lactones,triterpenes, tannins, saponins, and organic acids possess diureticproperties (315). Physicon, an anthraquinone derived from R.abyssinicus, exhibited prominent antioxidant activity (478).Further research is needed to isolate and elucidate the structureand characterize the active metabolites of this plant based onthese observed effects.A phytochemical analysis of R. chalepensis leaf extracts, whichshowed anti-HTN effects, confirmed the presence of flavonoids,coumarins, sterols, and alkaloids (496). Phytochemical screeningof extracts from the aerial parts that exhibited hypotensiveactivity revealed the presence of chromophores, polyphenols,saponins, phytosteroids, withanoids, tannins, anthraquinoneglycosides, and cardiac glycosides (10). In various solvent extractsof R. chalepensis leaves, compounds such as 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine (an anti-inflammatory agent), quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2,4,7-tetramethyl- (with anti-DM,antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antihyperlipidemicproperties), dioctadecyl disulfide (antiinflammatory), cobaltphthalocyanine (antioxidant and reducing agent), andhydrazinecarbothioamide (antioxidant) were identified as keyconstituents (627).Salvia tiliifolia, native to the Americas, has been suggested topossess anti-HTN properties in Ethiopia (83). While nopreclinical or clinical studies have yet confirmed its anti-HTNeffects, tilifodiolide (45), a diterpene compound derived from thisplant, has demonstrated vasorelaxant effects through NO andcGMP pathways in isolated rat aortas (628). Supporting this,other species of the Salvia genus, such as S. aucheri and S.elegans, have shown anti-HTN properties (629, 630), while S.scutellarioides and S. officinalis exhibited diuretic effects (631,632). S. tiliifolia has been reported to possess antioxidant,antiinflammatory and anti-DM activities (628).The analysis of the aerial parts of S. punctata, whichdemonstrated anti-HTN effects, led to the isolation of twophenolic compounds: rosmarinic acid and linarin. Rosmarinicacid caused a significant reduction in MAP in normotensiveguinea pigs. This compound, also extracted from other plants,has been reported to possess various pharmacological properties,including antioxidant, antiinflammatory, LDL oxidationinhibition, and antiangiogenic activities (489).Steroidal triterpenes of the euphane type were isolated fromS. molle, which exhibited ACEI activity (501). Compoundssuch as 2\"-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-hyperin, quercitrin 3-O-\u03b2-D-neohesperidoside, miquelianin, quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-D-galacturonopyranoside, isoquercitrin, hyperin, and hyperin 6\"-O-gallate, separated from the leaves, demonstrated radical-scavenging properties (633). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbonterebinthene was isolated from S. molle resin (634).Biflavanone, chamaesjasmin, triterpenes, 3-epi-isomasticadienolalic acid, and isomasticadienonalic acid fromS. molle showed antiinflammatory activity (495).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 45 frontiersin.orgPhytochemical screening of S. nigrum extracts revealed thepresence of phenols, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, saponins,steroids, tannins, terpenoids, triterpenoids, phlobatannins,hydrocyanic acid, and phytic acid (515, 517, 635). From S.nigrum fruit extracts that displayed vasorelaxant activity,compounds such as hydroxylamine, O-(2-methylpropyl);1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester; 13-docosenamide,(Z); and 1,6:3,4-dianhydro-2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-ribo-hexopyranose wereisolated (506, 514). Steroidal compounds, particularly steroidalglycosides, are considered the main bioactive constituents of S.nigrum, responsible for its various pharmacological effects,including antiinflammatory activity (504).Lignanamides, such as cannabisin F, are known for theirantiinflammatory effects. Scopoletin (46), a coumarin compoundfound in S. nigrum, exhibited antiinflammatory, hypoglycemic,and hypotensive effects. Polyphenols derived from S. nigrum arereported to have antiobesity benefits. The flavonoids contributeto its antioxidant activity. Benzoic acids with phenolic hydroxylgroups found in S. nigrum, such as 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid,gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoicacid, salicylic acid, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, mostlyexhibited antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects.Polysaccharides from S. nigrum, including mannose, glucose,galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, and xylose,demonstrated liver-protective properties (504).Extracts of S. guineense were found to contain polyphenols,alkaloids, saponins, steroids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, tannins,and coumarins (636). Analysis of the leaf extract with anti-DMeffects revealed the presence of rutin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside,quercitrin, and quercetin (637). Chromatographic screening ofberry leaf extracts, which demonstrated organ-protective andantioxidant effects, identified phenolic compounds such asapigenin, 3,4-OH benzoic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, eugenol,gallic acid, O-coumaric acid, P-coumaric acid, tyrosol, tyrosol-OH,vanillic acid, and syringic acid (525). Organic acids andhydrocarbons were the major compound classes identified (638).Among the polyphenols in the berry leaf extract, ellagitannins likecasuarictin and casuarinin and gallotannins such as pentagalloylglucose exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity (639).In the anti-DM extract of T. indica fruit pulp, saponins,glycosides, alkaloids, anthraquinones, and proteins wereidentified (534). The extract from the pericarp of ripening T.indica, which showed anti-HTN activity, tested positive forproteins, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, steroids, triterpenoids,polyphenols, and flavonoids. Among the biometabolites oftamarind, \u03b3-sitosterol (47) was found to be the most effectiveligand for managing HTN, demonstrating drug-likeness with abinding energy of \u22129.3 kcal and significant ligand-receptorinteractions with the GC. Gamma-sitosterol consistently affectedfourteen targeted genes, including NR3C1, PPARG, REN, andCYP11B1, contributing to reduced HTN and related risk factors(531). The diuretic activity of T. indica fruit pulp has beenattributed to its content of Mg, ascorbic acid, Ca, K, andterpinen-4-ol (529).An analysis of T. indica fruit pulp extract identified 37 differentcompounds. Among these, the bioactives were5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, triethylenediamine,1,6-anhydro-\u03b2-d-glucopyranose, 5-methylfurancarboxaldehyde,1-(2-furanyl)-1-propanone, levoglucosenone, methyl 2-furoate,2-heptanol acetate, methyl ester hepta-2,4-dienoic acid, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one, n-hexadecanoic acid, 3-methyl-2-furoic acid, cis-vaccenic acid, 5-[(5-methyl-2-fur-2)]furancarboxaldehyde, and O-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside. These compounds areknown for their various biological activities, such as antioxidantproperties (533).An analysis of T. indica sweet extract, which demonstratedcardioprotective properties, revealed 40 compounds. Amongthese, thymine (48) and 4H-pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl- (49) exhibited the strongest bindinginteractions with human AT1-receptor antagonists and AT1-receptor antagonist complexes with PPAR\u03b3 agonists. PPAR\u03b3,known as a nutrient-sensing signaling receptor, plays asignificant role in influencing the nutritional regulation of HTNand MS (534). Flavonoids isolated from T. indica, such asprocyanidins, catechin, taxifolin, apigenin, luteolin, andnaringenin, demonstrated antiinflammatory activity (640).Phytochemical screening of T. schimperi leaf extract, known forits anti-HTN effects, identified the presence of phenols,polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, anthraquinones, glycosides,tannins, and saponins (23, 54).An analysis of T. serrulatus aerial parts extract, known for itsantioxidant and antihyperglycemic properties, revealed thepresence of various phenolic compounds. These include quinicacid, danshensu, yunnaneic acid E, feruloylquinic acid,hydroxyjasmonic acid-O-hexoside, apigenin di-C-glucoside,eriodictyol-O-hexoside, quercetin glucuronide, quercetin-O-hexoside, salvianolic acid C derivative, luteolin-7-O-glucoside,luteolin-O-diglucoside, rosmarinic acid hexoside, rosmarinic acidderivatives, salvianolic acids A, B, and F derivatives, K,isoscutellarein-O-glucuronide, luteolin acetyl dipentoside, methylrosmarinate, and caffeoyl rosmarinic acid. The essential oilextracted from the aerial parts, which also exhibited antioxidantand antihyperglycemic effects, was primarily composed ofphenolic monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons. Theseincluded \u03b1-thujene, \u03b1-pinene, 3-octanone, \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b1-terpinene, p-cymene, D-sylvestrene, (Z)-\u03b2-ocimene, (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, \u03b3-terpinene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol,thymol methyl ether, carvacrol methyl ether, thymol, carvacrol,thymol acetate, carvacrol acetate, (E)-caryophyllene, germacreneD, and \u03b2-bisabolene (539).Phytochemical analysis of fenugreek extracts, which exhibitedanti-HTN and diuretic effects, identified several compounds.These included terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponin,glycosides, saponin glycoside, polyphenols, steroids, steroidalsaponin, dioscin, coumarin derivatives, tannins, tannic acid,gitogenin, trigogenin, neogitogenin, homorientin, saponaretin,neogigogenin, vitamins, minerals, and proteins (547, 568, 641).The saponin-rich fraction from T. foenum-graecum seedsdisplayed anti-HTN activity in rats (642). Diosgenin (50), aphytosteroid found in fenugreek, protected against ED and OScaused by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Diosgenin, along withNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 46 frontiersin.org4-isohydroxyleucine and galactomannan, is responsible forfenugreek\u2019s beneficial effects on MS and T2DM. It directly affectsarterial SM cells by regulating their viability, preventing cellmigration, and promoting endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.Diosgenin helps alleviate free FA-induced ED and IR byinhibiting the inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa-B kinase sub-unit beta (IKK-\u03b2) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)pathways (545).Fenugreek leaves, known for their antioxidant andantiinflammatory properties, contain various phenoliccompounds, including oleuropein, chlorogenic acid, pyrogallol,ferulic acid, ellagic acid, coumarin, 4-aminobenzoic acid,3-hydroxytyrosol, catechol, caffeic acid, \u03b2-resorcylic acid, gentisicacid, gallic acid, o- and m-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid. Theyalso contain flavonoids such as catechin, kaempferol-3, 2-p-coumaroyl glucose, hesperidin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, naringin,naringenin, rosmarinic acid, and isorhamnetin, along withisoflavonoids and phytoestrogens like daidzein, genistein,biochanin A, and isoformononetin (643). Key components infenugreek responsible for its antidiabetic effects include saponins,4-hydroxyisoleucine, sapogenin, diosgenin, trigonelline, and asoluble fiber rich in galactomannan. Diosgenin, protodioscin(a furostanol saponin), and trigonelline have demonstratedantiproliferative properties, while steroidal saponins and saponinshave shown antiinflammatory effects (644). Trigonelline anddiosgenin may also serve as prebiotic supplements for treatingand preventing hyperlipidemia and IR (645).The polyphenolic fraction of V. amygdalina leaf extract showedpromising inhibitory effects on both ACE and renin, suggestingthese as possible mechanisms for its anti-HTN potential. Thephenolic-rich extracts also inhibited \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase(646). The biflavonoids in bitter leaf are believed to havechemopreventive properties, as they can neutralize free radicals,enhance detoxification, block stress response proteins, anddisrupt the ability of certain transcription factors to bind toDNA (548).Nutraceuticals derived from V. amygdalina, particularlyphytosterols like \u03b2-sitosterol and \u03b2-sitosterol glucoside, havedemonstrated cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects,suggesting potential applications in managing CVDs. \u03b2-sitosterolis often used in combination Rxs for atherogenesis and OS (549).The antioxidant activity of flavonoids from V. amygdalina hasbeen documented (647). The negative inotropic and chronotropiceffects of V. amygdalina leaves may be linked to resveratrol(a flavonoid), diosgenin, sulforaphane (an isothiocyanate), andhigh K levels. Condensed tannins, soluble tannins, indoles,steroidal alkaloids, and cyanogenic glycosides found in V.amygdalina leaf extracts may contribute to its effects on reducingHR and contraction strength (551).Flavonoids such as luteolin, luteolin 7-O-glucosides, andluteolin 7-O-glucuronide, along with alkaloids found in V.amygdalina extracts, may contribute to their diuretic effects.Some flavonoids are known to interact with the A1-receptor,which is associated with diuretic activity (47). Compounds likeluteolin, luteolin 7-O-\u03b2-glucuronoside, luteolin 7-O-\u03b2-glucoside,11\u03b1-hydroxyurs-5,12-dien-28-oic acid-3\u03b1,25-olide, 10-geranyl-O-\u03b2-D-xyloside, 1-heneicosenol O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, vernodalol,3\u2032-deoxyvernodalol, and 6\u03b2,10\u03b2,14\u03b2-trimethylheptadecan-15\u03b1-olyl-15-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-1,5\u03b2-olide, identified from V.amygdalina, have shown anti-oxidant properties. Additionally,vernoniosides and 3\u2032-deoxyvernodalol exhibited antiinflammatoryactivity, while hydroxyvernolide and 6\u03b2,10\u03b2,14\u03b2-trimethylheptadecan-15\u03b1-olyl-15-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-1,5\u03b2-olidehave shown anti-DM potential (548, 550).Ginger is widely used as a nutraceutical due to its numeroushealth benefits. Chemical studies have identified over 400compounds in ginger (561). One of the key compounds,6-gingerol, has shown a range of biological activities, includinganti-oxidant and the ability to improve hyperlipidemia (2). Othercompounds, such as zingerone, geraniol, shogaols, gingerdiols,gingerdiones, and dehydrogingerdiones, have also demonstratedantioxidant properties. While 6-gingerol has established anti-DMand renoprotective effects, zingerone and 6-shogaol are noted fortheir antiobesity activities. Gingerol and its related compoundsexhibited antiinflammatory effects, with both 6-gingerol and6-shogaol acting to inhibit platelet aggregation (561). Gingerrhizome extract, which has been shown to lower BP, containssaponins, flavonoids, and alkaloids (563). The anti-HTN effectsof petroleum ether extract of Z. officinale rhizome and its toluenefraction may be attributed to gingerols and galanolactone, asthese compounds are known antagonists of the 5-HT3 receptor(568).A decoction of Z. officinale rhizome, which exhibited negativeinotropic and chronotropic effects, was found to contain 6-gingerol(51), 8-gingerol (52), and 6-shogaol (53). Among these, 6-gingerolwas 6.5 times more effective as a negative inotropic agent ascompared to nifedipine. Conversely, 8-gingerol was 2.2 timesmore potent than verapamil and 2.8 times more potent thandiltiazem. While 6-shogaol, a dehydrated form of 6-gingerol,displayed only minimal negative chronotropic activity comparedto verapamil and diltiazem, 6-gingerol and 8-gingerol did notexhibit any chronotropic effects (569). Ginger phenoliccompounds 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol (54) demonstratedendothelium-dependent vasodilatory and Ca2+-antagonistactivities (571). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 6-, 8-, and10-gingerol have good oral bioavailability and exhibitedvasodilatory, hepatoprotective, vasoprotective, and antioxidantproperties. Molecular docking studies indicated that thesegingerol compounds, along with losartan, bind similarly to theAT1-receptor. Thus, red ginger shows potential as an oral drugcandidate for treating HTN (648).Oleoresin, a non-volatile pungent or flavoring compoundfound in Z. officinale, demonstrated significant antioxidantactivity (649). The bioactive components of Z. officinale Var.Rubrum (red ginger) are predominantly terpenes, which mayinhibit ACE activity. Analysis of red ginger identified five keychemicals: farnesene, zingiberene, \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene (55), \u03b1-curcumene, and trans-\u03b2-farnesene. In silico docking studiesrevealed that \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene had the lowest binding energyof \u22126.55 kcal/mol with ACE, suggesting that both red gingerextract and \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene could be promising candidatesfor anti-HTN drugs (650). Polyphenols can also inhibit ACE.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 47 frontiersin.orgThese compounds are reported to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterolsynthesis in the liver, and intestinal acyl CoA (cholesterolacyltransferase), which is involved in cholesterol absorption. Thissuggests that the reduction in dietary cholesterol absorption maycontribute to the hypocholesterolemic effects of this spice (651).Overall, the secondary metabolites of plants such as A. remota,C. aurea, C. papaya, C. macrostachyus, M. azedarach, O.integrifolia, M. stenopetala, R. abyssinicus, R. chalepensis, S.punctata, S. molle, S. nigrum, S. guineense, T. indica, T. foenum-graecum, V. amygdalina, and Z. officinale require furtherbioassay-guided isolation, structural elucidation, andcharacterization. After isolation, the compounds should beassessed for their anti-HTN activities and mechanisms of actionin vitro and in animal models. For plants like A. hispidum, A.aspera, C. lanatus, C. sativum, C. citratus, F. vulgare, L. albus, H.vulgare, M. spicata, N. sativa, and P. americana, additional workon isolating bioactive metabolites, elucidating their structures,characterizing them, and evaluating their anti-HTN propertiesis needed.Compounds already isolated and characterized from C.aurantium, C. aurantiifolia, C. medica, C. grandis, and L.leucocephala require further preclinical studies to betterunderstand their mechanisms of action and anti-HTN effects.For A. cepa, A. sativum, H. sabdariffa, L. usitatissimum, M.oleifera, P. edulis, R. officinalis, T. indica, T. foenum-graecum,and Z. officinale, comprehensive efficacy, pharmacokinetic, andsafety studies should be conducted, followed by clinical trials.Promising compounds from the studied plants includechlorogenic acid, achyranthine, quercetin, quercitrin, allicin, allyldisulfide, diallyl trisulfide, eriocitrin, hesperidin, quercetin,diosmetin, citral, hibiscus acid, garcinia acid, delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside, isoorientin, gramine,secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, rosmarinic acid, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, oleic acid, linoleic acid,thymoquinone, luteolin, orientin, scirpusin B, chrysin, \u03b2-caryophyllene, carnosic acid, carnosol, ethyl rosmarinate,tilifodiolide, \u03b3-sitosterol, thymine, diosgenin, 6-gingerol,8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene. Many of thesecompounds have multiple mechanisms of action, making themsuitable candidates for polypharmacology and networkpharmacology approaches to develop novel anti-HTN drugs.Exploring scientifically validated and technologically standardizedbotanical products from these extracts and compounds throughreverse pharmacology could expedite drug discovery.Comprehensive bioinformatics and chemoinformatics analyses,along with in silico studies of these compounds, have the potentialto uncover promising drug candidates. Emerging evidencehighlights the critical roles of both genetic and epigenetic factorsin the regulation and maintenance of BP, as well as in theindividual susceptibility to HTN. The interplay between geneticpredisposition and environmental influences is increasinglyrecognized as a key contributor to HTN risk. Notably, epigeneticmodifications offer valuable mechanistic insights and representpromising therapeutic targets in the management of CVDs. Inthis context, herbal medicines demonstrate a strong potential tomodulate the onset and progression of chronic diseases throughepigenetic mechanisms.5.4 Toxicity profiles and drug-inetractionsof antihypertensive medicinal plantsAlthough plants used in ethnomedicine are generallyconsidered safe, it is crucial to rigorously evaluate their safetywhen used in scientific research. This is particularly importantwhen the preparation methods diverge from traditional practices,such as using organic solvents instead of aqueous ones. Factorslike the plant\u2019s age, geographical location, and the timing andseason of harvest can influence its phytochemical compositionand potential toxicity. For example, flavonoids were found in theolder leaves but not in the younger leaves of bitter leaf ethanolextract (652).The ethanol-soluble fraction of A. hispidum did not cause anyacute toxic effects. However, teratogenic effects have been observedin female Wistar rats treated with the aqueous extract of this plant,suggesting that it should be avoided during pregnancy. Despite thetoxicity found in the seeds and shoots, the roots of A. hispidum didnot exhibit any toxicity. Root extracts showed neither bactericidalnor mutagenic effects and were non-toxic at doses up to2,000 mg/kg in rats (150, 154). Toxicity assays using Artemiasalina indicated that aqueous, hydroalcoholic, methanolic, anddichloromethane fractions and compounds isolated from theaerial parts and leaves of A. hispidum were not toxic. Acute andsubacute toxicity tests on ethanolic and aqueous extracts fromthe whole plant revealed no toxic effects, with an estimatedaverage lethal dose of 5,000 mg/kg (149). Although currentevidence suggests that A. hispidum is relatively safe, it isadvisable to conduct subchronic, chronic, and genotoxicitystudies before using it for disease management.In acute toxicity tests, both alcoholic and aqueous extracts of A.aspera leaves were found to be safe, with no mortality observedeven at a dose of 800 mg/kg (159). Another study by Bhosaleet al. established that the toxic dose of aqueous extracts of A.aspera leaves and the whole plant exceeds 2,000 mg/kg (162).Additionally, methanolic and aqueous leaf extracts of the plantwere shown to protect DNA from damage caused by ultravioletrays (161). However, A. aspera may induce reproductive toxicityin male rats (653).For A. remota, the acute toxicity tests indicated that the medianlethal doses (LD50) of aqueous and 70% ethanol leaf extracts wereabove 5,000 mg/kg, suggesting that the extracts are not toxic underthe tested conditions (166). Nonetheless, further research isneeded, including subacute, subchronic, chronic, and genotoxicitystudies, to fully evaluate the plant\u2019s safety.In an acute toxicity study, the LD50 of the n-butanol extractfrom A. cepa bulbs was found to be greater than 500 mg/kg inrats (32). Participants taking quercetin-rich onion supplementsreported no adverse effects (176). Zaman et al. noted that whilethe methanolic bulb extract of A. cepa did not exhibit teratogeniceffects on female mice, it did have anti-fertility effects on malemice, indicating moderate side effects and minimal toxicity (654).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 48 frontiersin.orgOnions can naturally and safely replace a variety of nutraceuticalsubstances and offer good nutritional value (170).Although A. sativum has numerous therapeutic benefits, it canalso cause minor side effects such as abdominal swelling,heartburn, flatulence, and acid reflux. Additionally, garlic\u2019santihemostatic effect may pose risks for individuals on anti-coagulant medications, so it is recommended that they avoidgarlic while on such prescriptions (3).The LD50 of crude C. papaya fruit extract was approximately325.2 mg/kg in mice (215). The ethanolic extract of papaya rootbark was deemed safe at a dose of 2,000 mg/kg in mice (217).Similarly, the methanolic leaf extract of papaya did not showacute toxicity at a dose of 2,000 mg/kg, and no sub-acute toxicitywas observed after 28 days at the same dose. There were nosignificant changes in hematological, hepatic, renal, or cardiacmarkers following administration of the methanolic leaf extractat 2,000 mg/kg (223). The LD50 for the leaf extract was above5,000 mg/kg, indicating no toxicity in acute studies. However,aqueous extracts of papaya were found to adversely affect theliver and reproductive system in rats (216). Despite its benefits,papaya can have side effects if consumed in excess. It hasantifertility properties and contains cyanogenic glucosides thatcan produce cyanide, which can be fatal. While generally safe asfood and medicine for most people, excessive consumption orprolonged skin application can cause esophageal damage,allergies, or irritation. Papaya should be avoided duringpregnancy due to potential adverse effects from the enzymepapain on the fetus (219). Further subacute, subchronic, chronic,and genotoxicity studies on various parts of the plant are neededto confirm its overall safety.Acute toxicity studies on C. lanatus extracts were conducted inrodents. The n-hexane extract (seed oil) was found to be safe atdoses up to 2,000 mg/kg. Similarly, the aqueous extracts of theroots and leaves were tested in mice, with no deaths observedduring the study period. The ethanolic extract showed nomortality up to 2,000 mg/kg when administered orally (231). Toensure the comprehensive safety of this edible plant, furthertoxicity studies are recommended.For individuals with fair skin, C. aurantium oil may causephotosensitivity, particularly if applied directly to the skin andexposed to strong light. In rare cases, oral consumption of bitterorange has also been associated with photosensitivity. Excessiveintake of orange peel has led to severe effects in children,including convulsions, death, and intestinal colic. While someChinese medicine texts recommend against using bitter orangeduring pregnancy, the American Herbal Products Associationclassifies it as \u201cclass 1,\u201d suggesting it is safe for use throughoutpregnancy when used properly. Bitter orange decoctions havebeen shown to elevate cyclosporine blood levels toxically in pigs,and in vitro studies have demonstrated that it inhibits humanCYP-450 3A (CYP3A), potentially affecting the metabolism ofdrugs processed by this enzyme. A pharmacokinetic interactioninvolving bitter orange and amiodarone in rats has beenreported. Compounds like synephrine and octopamine in bitterorange can cause HTN and arrhythmias, which may lead tosevere CV events such as heart attack, stroke, and death.Products containing C. aurantium have been linked to seriousclinical adverse events, mostly related to CV issues, includingsyncope, QT interval prolongation, MI, ischemic stroke, angina,tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, vasospasm, ventricularfibrillation, and ischemic colitis (239, 242).In an acute toxicity assessment, the methanol fruit extract of C.aurantiifolia was deemed safe in mice at doses below 3,000 mg/kg,but doses exceeding 3,500 mg/kg were found to be toxic to rats(244, 246). Conversely, the methanol fruit peel extract showed notoxicity in mice even at a dose of 5,000 mg/kg. Both acute andsub-chronic toxicity tests of the water extract from roots revealedno signs of toxicity or significant histopathological changes inrats. However, the essential oil contains coumarins, which cancause phototoxicity in humans and have been linked to tumorformation on the skin and foregut of mice. C. aurantiifolia juicewas found to reduce the number of ova shed in rats, disrupt theestrous cycle, partially prevent ovulation, and alter the histologyof the uterus and ovaries, potentially affecting fertility. The juicealso has abortifacient effects but does not appear to beteratogenic. Despite these findings, further detailed toxicitystudies are necessary to fully establish the safety of this plant fortherapeutic use (244).In acute and sub-acute toxicity studies, C. limon juicedemonstrated no harmful effects on experimental animals,indicating it is non-toxic and safe for consumption, even atconcentrations exceeding 80% (655). When lemon extract wasincorporated into animal feed up to the maximum safe level, noadverse effects were observed in the animals (254). Additionally,pre-Rx with lemon essential oil significantly protected rats fromaspirin-induced gastric injuries, likely due to the antioxidantproperties of the oil (255). However, caution is advised for lemonjuice consumers, as there is a potential for pharmacologicalinteractions with anti-HTN medications, and non-adherence torecommended dosages may pose risks (656).An aqueous leaf extract of C. grandis was found to betoxicologically safe at 750 mg/kg in rats (657). In both acute andsubacute toxicity studies, no general symptoms of toxicity ormortality were observed within 72 h following the administrationof a methanolic leaf extract. Doses between 300 and 2,000 mg/kgdid not result in toxicity symptoms in the animals, and nosignificant changes were noted in biochemical blood markers ororgan function. Moreover, there were no abnormal eating ordrinking habits or changes in body weight while taking theprescribed doses. Histopathological examinations revealed noabnormalities in the liver or kidneys after Rx with plant extractsat doses between 200 and 800 mg/kg (658). While these studiessuggest that C. grandis is generally safe, further comprehensivetoxicity tests are needed to confirm its safety.Using Lorke\u2019s method for assessing acute toxicity in mice, boththe leaf extract and flavonoid-rich fraction of C. sativum werefound to be non-toxic even at 5,000 mg/kg, indicating the plant\u2019ssafety at these levels (274). Aqueous and methanol mixtures ofcoriander fruit extract also showed no signs of acute toxicitywhen administered orally at doses up to 10,000 mg/kg. Theanimals exhibited no convulsions or writhing, and reflexes suchas the righting and corneal reflexes remained intact (267). TheNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 49 frontiersin.orgAmerican Plant Products Association classifies coriander fruit as aclass I herb, meaning it can be used without concern (659).A 28-day oral gavage study in rats found that the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for coriander essential oil is approximately160 mg/kg per day. In a developmental toxicity study, thematernal no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 250 mg/kg per day, while the developmental NOAEL was 500 mg/kgdaily. Although studies on the mutagenicity of coriander and itsderivatives have produced mixed results, coriander oil has beenconfirmed as non-clastogenic, and its main component, linalool,is non-mutagenic. While coriander oil can irritate rabbits, it doesnot irritate humans, and, unlike the whole spice, it is notconsidered a sensitizer. The LD50 of C. sativum essential oil wascalculated at 2.257 ml/kg. Research in Italy on C. sativum grownas an oilseed crop explored antinutritional compounds such asglucosinolates, sinapine, inositol phosphates, and condensedtannins, which may negatively impact the nutritional value ofoilseed residues (269). The U.S. FDA and the Flavor and ExtractManufacturers Association have approved coriander essential oilas a safe food seasoning (659). However, further toxicity studies,including genotoxicity tests, are recommended to confirm its safety.Acute toxicity studies have shown that aqueous and 80%methanol leaf extracts of C. macrostachyus are safe in mice at2,000 mg and 5,000 mg/kg, indicating that the extract\u2019s LD50exceeds 5,000 mg/kg (275). However, toxicity tests on albinomice found the aqueous bark extract to have an LD50 of190.2 mg/kg, while the hydroalcoholic bark extract had an LD50of 87.5 mg/kg. Oral toxicity was assessed in Nubian goat calvesusing C. macrostachyus seeds at 250 mg/kg and 1,000 mg/kg,both of which were fatal in kids between seven and twenty-onedays old, leading to toxic effects, including death. Cytotoxicitystudies suggest that C. macrostachyus extracts could either beharmful or contain beneficial cytotoxic compounds. Therefore,caution is advised when using this plant as an herbal remedy (277).Cymbopogon is generally safe when consumed orally, appliedtopically, or used in aromatherapy. However, certain factors, suchas heavy metal contamination from the soil, drug interactions,and improper use, can lead to adverse effects (660). Sousa et al.(661) reported significant cellular damage, includingchromosome aberrations and cell death, due to the incorrect useof C. citratus. Similarly, Aberu et al. (662) found that lemongrasswater extracts (2%, 4%, and 8%) had genotoxic effects on animalbone marrow. Therefore, the consumption of lemongrass teashould be moderated and monitored by health professionals.Toxicological studies indicate that C. citratus essential oil has lowtoxicity and is considered safe for long-term use at doses up to100 mg/kg. While the USA classifies lemongrass as relatively safe,it is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due toits ability to stimulate uterine contractions and menstrual flow(660). A combination of C. citratus and B. pilosa aqueousextracts was found to be mildly toxic in acute and subchronictoxicity tests but caused no damage to vital organs, with an LD50greater than 5,000 mg/kg in rats (663). Lemongrass essential oiland its compound citral showed no toxic effects in animals at2,000 mg/kg in both subacute and acute toxicity tests (664, 665).The long-standing ethnomedicinal use of F. vulgare withoutreports of significant side effects suggests it is generally safe. Bothacute and long-term toxicity studies have confirmed the safety offennel extract when taken in recommended doses (293).Nevertheless, one compound, estragole (methylchavicol), hasraised concerns. Estragole has been linked to the development ofcancerous tumors in rodents, although its potential to causecancer in humans remains unclear. Numerous studies havesuggested that estragole, a component of fennel essential oil, maybe genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic. Its carcinogenicityappears to be tissue-, species-, and sex-specific. Recent findings,however, indicate that estragole does not directly cause cancer.Instead, its carcinogenic potential is tied to its metabolicactivation, which produces unstable molecules and active radicalsthat can damage DNA by forming adducts with nucleic acids(666). About 13 compounds isolated from methanolic fennelextract were found to inhibit CYP3A4 activity in the humanliver, which could result in unwanted drug interactions,particularly when fennel is consumed alongside anti-HTNmedications (293).In at least 10 countries, infusions and decoctions of H.sabdariffa calyx are used to treat hyperlipidemia and HTN, withno reported adverse events or side effects. The LD50 for H.sabdariffa extracts ranges from 2,000 to over 5,000 mg/kg/day inacute doses and up to 200 mg/kg in chronic three-month studies(300, 667). It is generally well-tolerated by patients (305, 307),and clinical trials have demonstrated 100% tolerability and safety(312). Although mild gastrointestinal symptoms have been notedin some studies, there is no evidence of hepatic or renal toxicityfrom roselle extract consumption. However, high doses of sourtea have been associated with adverse changes in hepatic andrenal biomarkers, and some HC patients have reported severedysuria. Sour tea at 200 mg/kg in mice has been shown to affectsperm morphology, testicular ultrastructure, and malereproductive fertility (300, 309). Therefore, high doses of H.sabdariffa should be avoided when used for therapeutic purposes.In contrast, administering H. sabdariffa water extract for 10weeks or hibiscus anthocyanins (50 to 200 mg/kg) for 5 days didnot affect the male reproductive system in rats. Nonetheless,studies have shown that consumption of sour tea water extractduring pregnancy and lactation in rats led to increased postnatalweight gain, delayed puberty onset, and higher BMI at puberty infemale offspring. The decreased maternal fluid and food intakeduring this period, coupled with increased plasma Na+ andcorticosterone levels, likely contributed to the accelerated growthand delayed puberty in offspring, possibly due to increasedcorticosterone and reduced leptin transfer through breast milk(668). Another consideration is the potential for herb-druginteractions. For instance, sour tea (20\u201340 mg/kg) taken withhydrochlorothiazides (10 mg/kg) significantly increased urinevolume in rats, raising the risk of dehydration (667). Moreover,sour tea extract can suppress up to 50% of CYP-450 isoforms atdoses between 306,000 and 1,660,000 mg/ml, meaning thatcaution should be exercised when sour tea is consumed alongsidedrugs (309).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 50 frontiersin.orgAn acute toxicity study established that the LD50 cut-off dosefor the ethanolic extract of H. vulgare seeds is 5,000 mg/kg,indicating its safety at this level (322). Barley is generallyconsidered non-toxic, though it contains certain allergens andanti-nutritional factors, which may pose toxic effects in extremecases (317). In genotoxicity tests on rats, a polysaccharidefraction from young barley leaves demonstrated safety, with noacute oral toxicity up to 5,000 mg/kg (669). Additionally, H.vulgare is reported to have antiapoptotic properties attributed tothe presence of 3,4-dehydroxybenzaldehyde, which helps protectagainst DNA damage (324).J. curcas exists in both toxic and non-toxic genotypes, with theharmless type found exclusively in Mexico and the dangerous typeprevalent worldwide. The toxic genotype contains phorbol esters,which mimic diacylglycerol (DAG), a key activator of PKC. Thisinterference with PKC disrupts various cellular processes,including phospholipid and protein synthesis, enzyme activities,DNA synthesis, protein phosphorylation, cell differentiation, andgene expression. Phorbol esters also have purgative, skin-irritating properties and act as cocarcinogens. Accidentalingestion of Jatropha seeds can cause symptoms such asdizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea in humans and can be fatal tovarious animal species. While defatted Jatropha meal from thenon-toxic genotype lacks phorbol esters, it still contains allergensand antinutritional factors (trypsin inhibitors, lectins, andphytates) similar to those in the toxic genotype (328).The absence of mortality in rats after administering 10\u20135,000 mg/kg of methanolic leaf extract of J. curcas suggests that itis generally safe (335). However, the LD50 of the ethanolic (50%)extract of J. curcas leaves was found to be 2,500 mg/kg in a studyon acute oral toxicity (333). The seed shell extract did not showsignificant cytotoxicity up to 250 \u03bcg/ml (331). But the extractbecame potentially toxic at >500 \u03bcg/ml, resulting in decreasedcell viability. Conversely, methanolic kernel meal extractsignificantly reduced cell viability in all tested cell lines at 6.25 g/ml and higher (329). Jatropha species are well-known for theirtoxic properties, primarily due to their latex and seeds. The latexis highly caustic and irritating to skin and mucous membranes,while the seeds contain toxalbumins that cause agglutination andhemolysis in RBCs, damage other cell types, and have a lipoidresin complex that can induce dermatitis (670). Therefore,caution is advised when using this herb for medicinal purposes.In an acute toxicity study, 50\u20132,000 mg/kg of ethanol seedextract from L. leucocephala did not produce any significant toxiceffects in rats (671). Different fractions and isolated compoundsshowed no cytotoxic activity against the Ehrlich ascitescarcinoma cell line at 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/ml (606). However, thepresence of mimosine makes Leucaena species unsuitable forlong-term human consumption. Mimosine is an alkaloid knownto cause hair loss, growth retardation, cataracts, goiter, decreasedfertility, and even mortality in non-ruminant mammals. Despitethis, by removing mimosine from the supernatant, it is possibleto produce L. leucocephala seed protein isolates with relativelylow mimosine levels through isoelectric precipitation of seedkernel proteins. These isolates have been used to reduce the riskof mimosine toxicity (339).L. usitatissimum is recognized as safe for consumption by theFDA. Nevertheless, flaxseed can cause mild side effects such asgastrointestinal discomfort, flatulence, and bloating, though thesetypically subside with a high fiber intake (356). Flaxseed oil isgenerally safe and well-tolerated, but high doses may lead todiarrhea and loose stools. Allergic reactions can also occur.Individuals with coagulation issues, pregnant and breastfeedingwomen, and children should exercise caution when consumingflaxseed oil (351).Although no toxicity has been reported in clinical studies,certain compounds in flaxseed, such as cyanogenic glycosidesand linatine, are recognized as potentially toxic. Cyanogenicglycosides\u2014such as linamarin, linustatin, neolinustatin,lotaustralin, and amygdalin\u2014are nitrogenous metabolites thatcan be converted by intestinal \u03b2-glycosidase into cyanohydrin,which breaks down into hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanideposes a risk of acute cyanide poisoning, affecting the respiratoryand nervous systems. However, consumption of flaxseed in15,000 up to 100,000 mg did not result in elevated plasmacyanide levels above baseline (672).Another compound, linatine, which has been identified as anantipyridoxine factor in chicks, is also considered potentiallyharmful. However, clinical studies have not shown flaxseed tocause a vitamin B6 deficiency in humans. Other compounds,such as phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors, have been suggestedto negatively impact nutritional status, but there is no evidencefrom studies showing changes in zinc levels due to phytic acid orany effect on trypsin inhibitor activity after flaxseedconsumption. In conclusion, there is currently no definitivescientific data supporting the idea of toxicity from dietaryflaxseed due to these compounds. More comprehensive toxicitystudies are needed to fully confirm the safety of this plant (672).L. albus is considered toxic when consumed at doses equal toor exceeding 1% of body weight. Sweet lupine, which contains alow concentration of toxic alkaloids (0.003%), poses minimaltoxicity risks for both animals and humans. Research usingreverse mutation assays and the mouse lymphoma and nuclearassays showed that the ethanolic extract of Lupinus termis is notgenotoxic. However, L. albus seeds, which contain higher levelsof alkaloids\u2014specifically quinolizidine alkaloids, a group of about100 bitter compounds\u2014can lead to cramps, vomiting, and evendeath due to respiratory paralysis. In humans, consumingexcessive amounts may also result in tremors and convulsions.Debittered seeds of L. albus are used therapeutically for oralconsumption, with a simple detoxification process involvingsoaking the seeds overnight in water. This helps dissolve water-soluble toxins and reduces the seeds\u2019 bitterness (357). Whitelupin seeds also have a low content of proteins with antinutritiveproperties (673).At doses ranging from 250 to 2,500 mg/kg, neither the ethanolnor water extracts of M. azedarach leaves caused death ornoticeable signs of general weakness in rats. As a result,2,500 mg/kg was established as the LD50 cut-off value (371).Similarly, methanolic leaf extracts at 1,000, 3,000, and 5,000 mg/kg were found to be safe in mice, with no signs of toxicityobserved within 24 h (370). The ethanol leaf extract has beenNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 51 frontiersin.orgshown to protect against H\u2082O\u2082-induced cellular damage,demonstrating a DNA protective effect (369). But, according totraditional Chinese medical literature, ingesting six to nine fruits,30\u201340 seeds, or 400 grams of bark can lead to M. azedarachpoisoning in humans. The plant\u2019s toxicity in humans isattributed to limonoids (674). While further research is neededto confirm the plant\u2019s overall safety, careful consideration ofdosage is crucial when consuming its products.In an acute toxicity study, a 70% methanol extract of M.piperita aerial parts was found to be safe at doses as high as10,000 mg/kg, with no observed signs of toxicity (378). Menthaspecies are recognized for their DNA-damage protectionproperties (382). However, a review indicates that peppermintand its main constituents\u2014pulegone, menthone, menthol, andmenthofuran\u2014exhibit mild toxicity. Despite this, peppermint andits menthol isomers do not pose significant mutagenic, genotoxic,or embryotoxic risks. One critical consideration is the interactionof peppermint essential oil with CYP-450 isoenzymes in the liverof both rats and humans, where it has been shown tosignificantly inhibit or reduce the activity of these enzymes. Thisinteraction is crucial for drug metabolism and has therapeuticimplications. Peppermint essential oil is not recommended forindividuals with bile duct obstruction, gallbladder inflammation,or liver diseases. Additionally, caution should be exercised inpatients with gastrointestinal reflux or hiatus hernia, aspeppermint oil may worsen reflux symptoms (675).Toxicological studies on M. spicata confirm its safety across arange of doses and time periods, supporting its traditional use asa tisane (herbal tea) in TMs. Both acute and subacute toxicitytests demonstrated that M. spicata is safe, with an LD50 of13,606 mg/kg. Despite its widespread use, there is limitedinformation on its complete safety profile. Prolonged use atmaximum doses may cause specific issues, highlighting the needfor further research into the plant\u2019s chronic toxicity to fullyunderstand its toxicological profile (384).M. oleifera leaves are considered safe based on toxicologicalstudies in rats, which showed good tolerability without anymutagenic or genotoxic effects (392). Decoctions of M. oleiferaleaves were also free of side effects or toxicity in hypertensivepatients (390). Acute oral toxicity tests in rats indicated safety atdoses up to 2,000 mg/kg, with no harm observed on A. salinalarvae at similar doses (11). Similarly, methanol and ethyl acetateextracts of M. oleifera leaves exhibited no toxicity up to2,000 mg/kg in mice (400). Toxicological studies havedemonstrated that the oral LD50 of the aqueous leaf extractexceeds 6,000 mg/kg, highlighting its wide margin of safety.Therapeutic consumption is considered safe at doses below1,000 mg/kg. No adverse effects on hemodynamic parameters,VF, or OS biomarkers were observed in normal rats afteradministration of M. oleifera leaf extract at 60 mg/kg, suggestingit is relatively safe for therapeutic use. However, caution may bewarranted regarding potential nephrotoxicity during long-termuse, as a slight increase in urea and creatinine levels was reportedin rats receiving the water leaf extract orally for 60 days (397).Most studies suggest that M. stenopetala is safe for therapeuticuse. Microencapsulated leaf extract of M. stenopetala showed noadverse effects in experimental mice, and acute toxicity testsreported no signs of toxicity or death at doses up to 5,000 mg/kg(406). Similarly, an acute toxicity study of the oral delivery of a5,000 mg/kg hydro-ethanolic extract of M. stenopetala leavesrevealed no morbidity or mortality in test animals, indicatingthat the oral LD50 is greater than 5,000 mg/kg (408). However,continuous use of M. stenopetala extract at doses exceedingtherapeutic levels may lead to mild toxicity (676). In an in vitrostudy, ethanol extracts of M. stenopetala leaves and seedsexhibited cytotoxic effects, suggesting the presence of toxiccompounds extractable by organic solvents or formed during theextraction process (677). High doses of crude M. stenopetalaextract were found unsafe for pregnant rats, causing significantdelays in embryonic and fetal development, reduced maternalweight gain during pregnancy, increased fetal resorptions, and ahigher risk of fetal mortality (678). These findings highlightpotential toxic and teratogenic effects, warranting caution whenconsidering its use during pregnancy.In an acute toxicity study, no lethal effects were observed inmice treated with aqueous extracts of N. sativa seeds, even at ahigh dose of 5,000 mg/kg (41). However, in a sub-acute toxicityinvestigation where mice were administered N. sativa aqueousextract daily for six weeks, one mouse died after two weeks oftreatment at 6,400 mg/kg. Additionally, at doses of 21,000 mg/kgand 60,000 mg/kg, two and three mice died during the third andfifth weeks, respectively. No other deaths were reported for lowerdoses (679). When the fixed black cumin oil was administeredthrough PO or IP routes in mice and rats, the acute toxicitystudies revealed LD50 values of 28.8 ml/kg and 2.06 ml/kg,respectively. In a chronic toxicity study, rats treated with a dailyoral dose of 2 ml/kg of black cumin oil for 12 weeks showed nosignificant changes in vital liver enzyme levels orhistopathological alterations. This suggests that N. sativa oil isgenerally well-tolerated with prolonged use, though high dosesmay pose risks (680).In an oral acute toxicity test of thymoquinone, the activeconstituent of black cumin, the LD50 was found to be 2,400 mg/kg in mice. A sub-chronic toxicity study involving mice treatedwith thymoquinone at 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg/day showed no signsof toxicity or death (681). Similarly, no adverse effects werereported in human studies (415\u2013417). Numerous scientificinvestigations have demonstrated that N. sativa and its activecompound, thymoquinone, exhibit modest or negligibletoxicological effects, with a wide therapeutic margin (682). Thissupports the safe, long-term use of N. sativa in both traditionalfood and medicinal contexts.In an acute oral toxicity test, the methanolic extract of O.integrifolia leaves, administered at doses up to 5,000 mg/kg,caused no mortality or adverse effects in experimental animals,suggesting that the hydroalcoholic leaf extract is reasonably safewhen administered orally to mice. In a sub-acute toxicity test, aslight reduction in packed cell volume was observed in extract-treated groups, which may be attributed to the presence ofsaponins in the crude extract. Saponins are known to causehemolysis by increasing the permeability of the plasmamembrane (683). In a genotoxicity study, Rx of cells with theNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 52 frontiersin.orgchloroform extract of O. integrifolia did not result in detectableDNA damage at 0.01\u20130.5 mg/ml compared to the control, furthersupporting the plant\u2019s safety (684). However, additional sub-chronic and chronic toxicological studies are recommended tofully assess the plant\u2019s safety profile.P. edulis is considered non-toxic and safe for dailyconsumption at usual doses. Clinical studies have confirmed itssafety for therapeutic use (444, 447). In acute and sub-acutetoxicity experiments, oral administration of ethanol extract fromunripe passion fruit peel at 550 mg/kg showed no harmful effectsin rats. Similarly, the aqueous extract of P. edulis leaves at2,000 mg/kg was also found to be safe (441). In vitro studiesrevealed that purple passion fruit peel extract reduced DNAdamage but did not inhibit cell proliferation. No significanthepatotoxicity was observed in in vitro tests of the passion fruitpeel extract (444, 447). Some extracts of P. edulis have showncytotoxicity against various cell types (441), highlighting the needfor careful consideration of extract types and dosages intherapeutic applications.The use of synthetic diuretic drugs can damage the stomach,but avocado leaf extract, due to its tannins and flavonoids,protects the gastric mucosa and does not cause such damage(467). For HTN Rx with avocado seed, dosage is crucial; highconcentrations could increase cholesterol levels and lead to AS(468). In an acute toxicity study, rats treated with 50\u2013200 mg/kgof P. americana aqueous leaf extract exhibited behavioral changesbut no deaths within 24 h, except for one rat that died on thethird day after receiving 200 mg/kg. A pilot study suggested thatdoses above 50 mg/kg could be lethal, setting the highestscreening dose for IP injections at 50 mg/kg (456). The LD50 ofthe ethanol seed extract of P. americana was determined to be707 mg/ml in rats (37). Another study found that the LD50 ofthe aqueous seed extract could not be established even at amaximum dose of 10,000 mg/kg. Subacute Rx with the aqueousextract did not affect body weight or organ-to-body weight ratios,indicating safety at this duration. However, extremely high dosesare not advisable (685). Additionally, an acute toxicity testshowed that 80% methanol avocado seed extract did not causedeath or overt toxicity signs at any tested doses in mice,suggesting an LD50 greater than 4,000 mg/kg (686).The LD50 of IP-administered ether seed extract of P. americanawas determined to be 751.6 mg/kg. In a sub-acute toxicity study,daily IP administration of P. americana seed extract at 75 and150 mg/kg led to a significant reduction in food intake, bodyweight, blood glucose, hemoglobin, and hepatic cholesterol, whileserum creatinine, uric acid, total protein, and total bilirubinlevels remained unaffected (687). Higher doses of the seed extract(500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg) resulted in death rates of 20%,60%, and 80%, respectively. No mortality was observed in groupsgiven 125 and 250 mg/kg doses or in the control group. TheLD50 of the avocado seed extract was thus calculated to be1,200.75 mg/kg. At 250 mg/kg, the extract was tested forgenotoxicity using the micronucleus test, which showed nogenotoxic effects (688).Rosemary extract has been recognized by the European Unionas a safe and effective natural antioxidant for food preservation(475). The essential oil of R. officinalis has an LD50 greater than2,000 mg/kg in both skin and oral acute toxicity studiesconducted on mice and rabbits. In acute skin irritation tests, a10% rosemary oil ointment did not induce acute toxicity. In sub-acute toxicity tests, rosemary essential oil did not cause mortalityor significant gross or biochemical abnormalities (689). Althoughrosemary oil is considered safe when used in recommendeddoses, it is not advised during pregnancy due to the potentialtoxicity of some components (624). For example, d-camphor, acomponent of rosemary oil, has shown embryotoxic effects inrats and rabbits. There is also limited safety data regarding itsuse during breastfeeding and in children under 12. Cineole, amajor constituent of rosemary oil, can induce liver metabolicenzymes in animals, which may affect the metabolism of otherprescription medications (690). Therefore, caution is advisedwhen using rosemary oil in the presence of liver conditions, suchas bile duct obstruction, cholangitis, liver disease, gallstones, orother biliary issues, and medical guidance is recommended (624).In oral acute toxicity tests, neither the aqueous nor the 80%methanolic extracts of R. abyssinicus rhizomes showed overttoxicity, with an LD50 estimated to be greater than 5,000 mg/kg(476). Mugisha et al. reported an LD50 of 7,727 mg/kg for a 70%ethanol leaf extract of R. abyssinicus in mice (691). In subacutetoxicity tests, rats treated with the ethanol leaf extract at doses upto 1,500 mg/kg showed no clinical signs of toxicity, no mortality,and no significant changes in body weight or hematologicalparameters. However, prolonged exposure to higher doses couldpotentially cause changes in histopathological, biochemical, andhematological parameters. In another study, subacute toxicitytesting with a 2,000 mg/kg dose of hydro-ethanolic rhizomeextract of R. abyssinicus did not result in any deaths but didshow a significant decrease in platelet count and mild acute liverinjury (692).The 80% methanolic rhizome extract of R. abyssinicus did notshow any toxicity signs in acute toxicity studies, and subacuteadministration for 28 days resulted in no significant changes inhematological or biochemical markers or overall body weight(693). The maximum (10%) concentration of an ointmentformulated from the methanolic rhizome extract, administered ata 2,000 mg/kg limit dose, was also found to be safe in acutedermal toxicity studies (694). Despite these findings, R.abyssinicus has not been fully evaluated for its safety as an herbalmedicine. Further research is needed to thoroughly assess thetoxicity of its extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds forpharmaceutical use. Plants from the Polygonaceae family, whichmay include R. abyssinicus, can contain high levels of oxalic acid.Consuming large amounts of oxalic acid can cause serious healthissues. To reduce the risk of poisoning, it is recommended toavoid ingesting the cooking water of these plants (695).In acute toxicity studies, the LD50 of R. chalepensis waterextract and its ethyl acetate fraction was determined to be585 mg/kg. High doses of this natural product could potentiallycause neurotoxic effects, so caution is advised when using it inTM (696). Conversely, no toxicity was observed in rats afteradministration of methanol, acetone, or aqueous leaf extracts at2,000 mg/kg (697). Rue essential oil has an LD50 greater thanNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 53 frontiersin.org5,000 mg/kg (698). Ethanolic extracts from the aerial parts of R.chalepensis caused no significant acute or chronic mortality inmice at 3,000 mg/kg. Nevertheless, these extracts did lead tosignificantly lower RBC levels. The extracts did not showspermatotoxic effects (699), although Ruta plants are known forother toxic effects. Contact dermatitis and phototoxicity arecommon issues linked to all Ruta species, often due tofuroquinoline alkaloids and furocoumarins that can causemutagenicity upon prolonged sunlight exposure (484). Chronictoxicity studies of R. chalepensis aerial part aqueous extract atdoses of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg in rats revealed no deaths orsignificant changes in body weight. However, male fertilityparameters showed notable reductions, including decreasedweight of the testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle, as well asreduced sperm count and motility at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg (700).Acute toxicity studies on the crude water extract of S. punctataaerial parts, administered at 2,000 mg/kg, showed no significantchanges in behavior or mortality in mice; all mice remainedphysically active (490). Similarly, no mortality or significantweight loss was observed in rats administered ethanol (70%)extracts of S. punctata aerial parts at 125, 500, and 2,000 mg/kgin both acute and subacute toxicity tests. However, this extractdid cause a notable drop in platelet count and minor acute liverinjury (692). In contrast, the essential oil from S. punctataexhibited higher cytotoxicity, with a 50% cytotoxic concentrationof 0.013 nl/ml against human monocytic leukemia cells, and alsodemonstrated hemolytic activity on erythrocytes (487). Thesefindings suggest that while some aspects of S. punctata appear tobe safe, particularly in the crude extract form, its essential oilshows significant cytotoxic and hemolytic effects. Comprehensivetoxicity studies are needed to fully assess the safety of this plantfor various uses.The acute oral toxicity test of S. molle seed extract at 2,000 mg/kg did not reveal any physical or behavioral abnormalities, nor didit cause any fatalities. This suggests that the LD50 of the seed extractis higher than 2,000 mg/kg (701). While there were no clear signsof toxicity, mice treated with fruit essential oils at doses of 1,000and 2,000 mg/kg displayed passive behavior during the first 24 h.The LD50 for both the leaf and fruit essential oils exceeded2,000 mg/kg. By the end of the experiment, no significant toxiceffects or organ weight changes were observed in the treatedanimals when compared to the control group. However, themedian lethal concentration (LC50) for the leaf and fruit essentialoils was 47 and 67 mg/ml, respectively, indicating a higher levelof toxicity toward A. salina. Overall, the essential oils were moretoxic to A. salina than to mice (494).Immediate dermal exposure to ethanolic and hexanic extractsfrom S. molle leaves caused only mild skin irritation and a slightstimulating effect on rats, suggesting the safety of these extractsfor topical use (499). Subchronic exposure to the ethanolicextracts from S. molle leaves and fruits appears to be safe andmay be beneficial for treating lipid disorders (702). In toxicitystudies, both acute (2,000 mg/kg) and subacute (1,000 mg/kg)exposures led to increased arousal levels in rats. After acuteexposure, the landing foot splay parameter increased, whilesubacute exposure significantly enhanced motor activity in theopen field test. These effects were temporary, disappearing within7 days. Organ function and structure remained unaffected byeither exposure. Overall, the findings suggest that S. molleethanolic extracts from the leaves and fruits are relatively safe fortherapeutic use (500).The toxicity of S. nigrum varies significantly depending on thespecific variety, and experts caution against consuming the berriesunless they are from a known edible strain. Two distinct varieties ofS. nigrum were identified: one with black-colored fruit and theother with reddish-brown fruit. The black fruit variety isconsidered toxic (515, 632). The presence of steroidal alkaloids,primarily solanine, in S. nigrum plays a protective role bydeterring animals from consuming its young leaves and fruits,aiding in the plant\u2019s survival. Solanine, a toxic compound,strongly irritates the gastrointestinal lining and has been shownto affect embryonic development, leading to risks of miscarriageand stillbirth. Toxicological studies on male mice revealed thatsolanine disrupts the bone marrow cell cycle, causing an increasein the ratio of cells in the G0/G1 phase while reducing the ratiosof cells in the S and G2/M phases, effectively blocking cellprogression. This interferes with DNA synthesis, leading to fewercells entering the G2/M phase. The incidence of micronucleusformation and sperm deformities increased with higher doses ofsolanine, indicating potential mutagenic and genetic toxicity.Fortunately, the solanine content in the leaves, stems, and fruitsof S. nigrum gradually decreases as the plant matures, reducingits overall toxicity over time (504, 515).Boiling S. nigrum likely destroys its toxic components, makingit edible after cooking. Similar to other nightshade vegetables, S.nigrum has been traditionally linked to the aggravation of jointpain in arthritic patients. This effect is believed to be due tosolanine, which is found in the green parts of these plants.However, while solanine is thought to be responsible forworsening joint pain, there is currently no scientific evidencespecifically linking the consumption of S. nigrum to jointinflammation (634).In an acute toxicity study using hydromethanolic extract ofblack nightshade at 2,000 mg/kg, no significant changes wereobserved in the animals\u2019 physical or behavioral characteristics(703). Even at a much higher dose of 21,500 mg/kg administeredthrough gavage to mice for 14 consecutive days, there were nosigns of toxicity or mortality. In genotoxicity tests, themutagenicity of S. nigrum juice was assessed using the mousesperm deformation test, micronucleus test, and Ames test, withall results being negative, indicating no genotoxic effects.Experimental evidence showed that the maximum tolerated doseof an aqueous decoction of S. nigrum in mice is 494,400 mg/kg.For humans, consuming typical amounts of black nightshade(30,000\u201360,000 mg) rarely results in toxic or adverse sideeffects (504).The total extract of S. nigrum was found to be safe at doses upto 5,000 mg/kg in acute toxicity studies, likely due to the presenceof glycoalkaloids complexed with metal ions, aside from Cu\u00b2+.However, subacute toxicity studies suggested that glycoalkaloidslacking metal ion conjugation contributed to increased toxicity.Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 54 frontiersin.orgIn 21-day sub-acute studies, the total extract was deemed saferegarding hematological and liver function parameters at oraldoses up to 4,000 mg/kg. In contrast, the glycoalkaloid fractionalone exhibited toxicity at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg (515).While S. nigrum showed lower overall toxicity, some effects onliver and kidney function were noted. Future clinical andpreclinical studies are necessary to ensure its safe use inmedicine, healthcare, and food products.The methanolic leaf extract of S. guineense did not cause deathin mice at 2,000 mg/kg, nor were there any noticeable physical orbehavioral signs of toxicity, suggesting an LD50 above 2,000 mg/kg (704). In another acute toxicity study, no toxicity or mortalitywas observed, even at doses up to 5,000 mg/kg (637, 705). Insubacute toxicity studies, high doses (1,600 mg/kg) of the stembark extract led to elevated liver enzymes and biochemicalmarkers of kidney damage, indicating potential hepatotoxicityand nephrotoxicity with prolonged use (706). At lower doses(500 and 1,500 mg/kg), no significant changes were observed inbehavior, body weight, or hematological and biochemicalparameters. There were also no significant differences in thegross and histological appearance of the liver and kidneysbetween the Rx and control groups. The 80% methanol extractshowed no adverse effects in acute or sub-acute Rxs (705).However, in a subchronic toxicity study, administration of a 70%ethanol leaf extract at 1,000 mg/kg resulted in altered foodconsumption, weight gain, and changes in liver and kidneyenzyme levels, suggesting that high doses of S. guineense may betoxic (707). Comprehensive chronic toxicity studies are necessarybefore any medicinal products of S. guineense leaves can beapproved for sale.Rx of rats with 1,000 mg/kg of 70% ethanolic S. guineense leafextract significantly prolonged the estrous cycle, reduced the weightof the uterus and ovaries, and lowered the number of live birthsand total pups. Despite these effects, no notable changes wereobserved in reproductive indices or the gross morphology andhistopathology of the ovaries, uterus, or vagina. This suggeststhat high doses of S. guineense may be toxic, and excessiveconsumption of the leaves is not recommended (524). In a studyon teratogenic effects, the extract did not significantly affectembryos or foetuses at doses up to 500 mg/kg. However, at1,000 mg/kg, it slowed embryo development, as indicated byreduced crown-rump length, somite count, and lowermorphological scores. Therefore, high doses of S. guineenseshould be avoided during pregnancy (708).In acute oral toxicity studies, ethanolic T. indica fruit pulpextract was well-tolerated at doses up to 3,000 mg/kg, with noobserved changes in gross behavior, signs of toxicity, or mortality(535). Similarly, oral acute toxicity tests at 3,000 mg/kg and5,000 mg/kg resulted in no deaths, suggesting an LD50 greaterthan 5,000 mg/kg, classifying it as practically non-toxic and safe(709). In tests using aqueous T. indica pulp extract, dosesranging from 900 to 4,500 mg/kg caused no mortality.Nonetheless, higher doses (2,700\u20134,500 mg/kg) induced somebehavioral changes in rats, such as aggressive scratching,anorexia, mild restlessness, and increased sensitivity to sound.Despite these behavioral effects, no significant differences inhematological or toxicological measures were observed whencompared to the control group. Histological examinations of theliver and kidneys showed no lesions, and no abnormalities weredetected in the gastrointestinal tract, such as congestion orhemorrhage. These findings provide scientific support for thesafety of T. indica in TM (710).The ethanol extract of T. indica stem bark, along with itsfractions, caused brine shrimp mortality rates ranging from86.70% to 3.30% at 200, 20, and 2 \u03bcg/ml. Sub-fractions exhibiteddeath rates between 46.70% and 3.30%. The LD50 values werecalculated to range from 832 \u03bcg/ml to 5,019 \u03bcg/ml. In rats, bloodlevels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartateaminotransferase (AST) were elevated after being administered25% and 50% of the LD50 determined in chicken embryos forthe crude extract and fractions (711). In contrast, the aqueousfruit pulp extract of T. indica showed no cytotoxicity atconcentrations up to 1,000 \u03bcg/ml, indicating its safety (526).When rats were given 5,000 mg/kg of T. indica leaf extract, noclear signs of toxicity were observed. Overall, the rats exhibited nomajor physical changes. However, those treated with a sub-chronicdose (2,000 mg/kg) of T. indica had a noticeable reduction in bodyweight percentages. Despite the administration of the extract, theorganosomatic indices for the liver and kidneys remained largelyunchanged in all the rats. Liver function tests (LFTs) intoxicological studies revealed significantly higher globulin andAST levels in the chronic group, though other LFT markers wereunaffected. In a sub-acute toxicity study at 2,000 mg/kg,degenerative changes in liver cells were noted. The chronictoxicity study showed congestion in the liver cells of rats treatedwith the same dose. Short-term use of the extract causedreversible, non-lethal toxic effects, while medium- to long-termuse led to subtle but fatal toxic effects. The traditional use of thisplant in folk medicine may be due to its ability to maintainstable hematological parameters, body weight, and lack offatalities (712).Likewise, studies indicated no acute toxicity (at 50 mg/kg) andno sub-chronic toxicity (up to 2,000 mg/kg) with variousconcentrations of methanolic extracts from T. indica fruits (713).In a separate study, when tamarind pulp water extract wasadministered at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg, no significantabnormalities were detected in blood biochemistry orhematology. This research concluded that prolonged use of T.indica pulp water extract at this dose is generally safe and well-tolerated (714).In the oral acute toxicity test, animals showed no signs oftoxicity or behavioral changes after being given 5,000 mg/kg of T.schimperi aquaous leaf extract, and all survived throughout thestudy period (54). However, at 2,000 mg/kg, T. schimperiessential oil caused a 50% mortality rate in the treated mice,suggesting its LD50 is around 2,000 mg/kg. For up to 14 daysafter application, an ointment made from T. schimperi oil didnot cause any adverse skin reactions. In subacute toxicity studies,the essential oil did not significantly affect body weight, nor didit substantially increase serum enzyme levels in the mice.Histopathological analysis of the liver and kidneys showed noserious damage to these organs from the plant (715).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 55 frontiersin.orgIn another acute toxicity study on rats, the LD50 for T.schimperi essential oil was found to be 1,284.2 mg/kg. Accordingto the WHO guidelines, this classifies the oil as moderatelyhazardous when taken orally. In a subacute toxicity study, ratsshowed no significant changes in behavior, gross pathology, bodyweight, biochemistry, or most hematological markers. However,the hematological analysis indicated that rats receiving 260 mg/kghad notably lower white blood cell (WBC) counts and highermean corpuscular volume (MCV) compared to the controlgroup. No significant differences were observed in the liver andkidney histopathology between treated and control groups. An insilico toxicity analysis using chemical absorption, distribution,metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) and vNN-ADMETpredictors revealed that none of the essential oil componentsexhibited cardiac toxicity, Ames mutagenicity (AMES), orcytotoxicity. Only a small percentage of the compounds (1.75%)were found to potentially harm the mitochondrial membrane,3.45% posed a risk for drug-induced liver injury, and 8.6%showed hepatotoxic potential. Overall, these results suggest thatoral administration of T. schimperi essential oil up to 130 mg/kgis considered safe (716).High doses of T. schimperi essential oil (130 and 260 mg/kg)negatively affect the development of embryos and fetuses in rats.It causes notable delays in embryonic and fetal growth, reducesthe number of implantation sites, and increases fetal resorption,indicating developmental toxicity. Administering higher doses ledto a significant decrease in placenta and litter weights. As aresult, the use of T. schimperi essential oil in excessive amountsis not recommended (536).The acute toxicity study of T. serrulatus aqueous leaf extractrevealed no signs of toxicity, with an LD50 exceeding 10,000 mg/kg. Most of the evaluated hematological and biochemicalparameters, along with body weight, showed no significantchanges following chronic oral administration of the extract.However, male mice treated with 600 mg/kg experienced anotable decrease in basophil count, and female mice at both 200and 600 mg/kg showed a significant reduction in creatininelevels. No deaths occurred, and body weight remained stablecompared to the control group. Both the kidneys and liverappeared normal upon gross examination, and histopathologicalanalysis confirmed no abnormalities in these organs (717).The oral acute toxicity study for the aqueous extract andessential oil from the aerial parts of T. serrulatus showed nomortality during the 14-day observation period. Both theaqueous extract and essential oil demonstrated no noticeable sideeffects at the highest tested dose of 2,000 mg/kg (539). However,the essential oils of T. serrulatus and T. schimperi, when testedfor acute oral toxicity, caused a burning sensation and inhibitedgrowth in mice. The LD50 for these essential oils ranges between2,000 and 5,000 \u03bcl/kg. Consuming large quantities of these herbsmay be toxic to vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnantwomen, especially since thyme\u2019s aerial parts, rather thanthe essential oils, are commonly used in teas and as foodadditives (718).Several animal and human toxicity studies have investigated T.foenum-graecum. In one animal study, the acute oral LD50 in ratswas found to exceed 5,000 mg/kg, and the acute dermal LD50 inrabbits was greater than 2,000 mg/kg. Another study showed thatdebitterized fenugreek powder did not cause toxicity or mortalityin rats and mice during acute (2,000 and 5,000 mg/kg) and sub-chronic (1%, 5%, and 10% in a pure diet) toxicity assessments.Additionally, weanling rats fed fenugreek seeds for 90 daysexhibited no significant hematological, hepatic, orhistopathological changes. A toxicological evaluation of 60patients with DM, who consumed 25,000 mg of powderedfenugreek seeds daily for 24 weeks, revealed no signs of liver orkidney damage or blood abnormalities. In its initial humanclinical trial, fenugreek extract was deemed safe and well-tolerated (546).In the acute toxicity test of fenugreek ethanol seed extract at adose of 3,000 mg/kg, no severe signs of toxicity or mortality wereobserved, though there was a mild increase in respiration andexcitation, indicating that the extract was relatively less toxic atthis dose. In a chronic toxicity study, one male mouse developedforelimb inflammation and baldness after 30 and 40 days of Rx,respectively. Two additional male mice experienced inflammationin both forelimbs and hindlimbs between 40 and 60 days of Rx.Survival studies showed significantly higher lethality in thetreated groups, and both male and female mice in these groupsceased to gain body weight. Prolonged Rx for 90 days had aminimal impact on organ indices, but there was a significantreduction in testicular weight in the male group. Allhematological parameters for both sexes remained normal, butbiochemical tests revealed significantly elevated ALT levels in thetreated animals. Male mice exposed to fenugreek chronicallyshowed severe spermatotoxic effects (641).The literature review on fenugreek does not report anyclinically significant harmful adverse effects. While fenugreek isgenerally considered safe and well-tolerated, there are someassociated adverse effects. Individuals with allergies to fenugreekor chickpeas should avoid fenugreek due to potential cross-reactivity. Fenugreek-containing curry powder can trigger allergicreactions in those with severe bronchospasm, asthma, ordiarrhea. Other reported side effects include occasional diarrhea,flatulence, and dizziness. Blood glucose levels should bemonitored following fenugreek supplementation due to the riskof hypoglycemia. Fenugreek can also reduce triiodothyronine(T3) production and lead to weight loss. Coumarin derivatives infenugreek may increase bleeding risk, particularly when usedwith antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, due to elevatedprothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR).Fenugreek should be avoided during pregnancy as it canstimulate uterine contractions, as seen in animal studies.Therefore, fenugreek should be used in moderation or at specificdoses when employed as a therapeutic agent (719).The structural characteristics of fenugreek fiber can impair theintestinal absorption of oral medications. Thus, fenugreek andrelated preparations should be taken after prescriptionmedications. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels isnecessary when fenugreek is used with hypoglycemic drugs, as itcan lower serum glucose levels more than expected. A smallstudy found that a water extract of fenugreek reduced K levels byNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 56 frontiersin.org14% in healthy patients, suggesting that fenugreek might causehypokalemia when used with mineralocorticoids, diuretics,purgatives, or other K-lowering medications. Fenugreek is alsobelieved to have estrogenic properties. It was observed to lowerserum T3 levels while increasing serum thyroxine (T4) levels.When taken with certain medications, fenugreek can enhancehypokalemic, hypoglycemic, and estrogenic effects. It may alsointeract with other drugs, so careful consideration of timing anddosage is essential when using fenugreek (719).In an acute toxicity study of V. amygdalina leaf extracts, oraladministration of a single dose of 5,000 mg/kg did not produceany harmful symptoms or mortality in rats, indicating an LD50greater than 5,000 mg/kg (652). However, an acute toxicity testof the aqueous leaf extract in rats showed an LD50 of1,265.22 mg/kg (720). Another acute oral toxicity study with theaqueous extract at 5,000 mg/kg revealed no mortality orsignificant physical or behavioral changes. Both the sighting andmain investigations showed no notable changes in body weight,organ weight, or biochemical markers. Given that the toxicity ofthe aqueous extract may be less than 5,000 mg/kg, it isconsidered safe for consumption as a vegetable or herb (721).Additionally, the methanol (80%) extract of V. amygdalinaleaves, administered at 2,000 mg/kg in an acute toxicity study,did not cause any morbidity, neurological, behavioral, autonomic,or physical changes in mice, and no deaths occurred. Thissuggests that the LD50 for the methanol extract could be greaterthan 2,000 mg/kg in mice (722).An acute toxicity assay of crude saponin from V. amygdalinaleaves, administered orally, revealed an LD50 of 5,152.3 mg/kg,indicating that it is nearly non-toxic (723). The water extract ofbitter leaf demonstrated very low cytotoxicity in brine shrimpassays, suggesting that V. amygdalina could be a safe candidatefor use as a nutraceutical or functional food (724). Sub-chronicoral administration (28 days) of methanol leaf extract of V.amygdalina at doses up to 1,200 mg/kg did not adversely affectliver or kidney functions in rats (725). Exposure of HepG2 cellsto chloroform root extract of V. amygdalina did not inducesignificant DNA damage, showing no genotoxic effect atconcentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.25 mg/ml. However, in MCF-7 cells, the leaf extract demonstrated a dose-dependent increasein DNA damage, with statistically significant damage observed at2 mg/ml (684).Ginger is widely considered a safe herbal drug and is classifiedas generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA. A dosageof 500\u20131,000 mg of ginger powder taken 2\u20133 times daily for 3months to 2.5 years has not been associated with adverse effects.The British Herbal Compendium also reports no adverse effectsfrom ginger. The acute oral LD50 for roasted ginger in rats is170,000 mg/kg, while for dry ginger, it exceeds 250,000 mg/kg(561, 726). Multiple studies confirm ginger\u2019s safety across variousconcentrations (100, 333, and 2,000 mg/kg) and experimentalperiods, demonstrating that it is non-toxic even duringpregnancy in rats and gynecological procedures, as shown inclinical studies (561).However, ginger tea exposure in utero may lead to increasedearly embryo loss and growth in surviving fetuses. Some minoradverse effects have been noted in humans. In a clinical trialwith 12 healthy volunteers taking 400 mg of ginger orally threetimes a day for two weeks, one participant reported milddiarrhea during the initial days. Doses exceeding 6,000 mg maycause stomach irritation and heartburn. Additionally, inhalationof ginger dust can trigger IgE-mediated allergies (727).Ginger powder (10%) mixed with a diet, along with two gingercompounds (genistein and 6-gingerol), demonstrated anti-genotoxic effects. Additionally, 6-gingerol showed in vitroradioprotective activity (728). The toxicity of gingerolcompounds is considered low, with no hepatotoxic effectsobserved (648). Few studies report interactions between gingerand medications. One study found that ginger did not affect thecoagulation status or the pharmacokinetics and dynamics ofwarfarin in patients (727). The anti-HTN efficacy and plasmaconcentration of losartan were significantly increased inhypertensive rats when combined with Z. officinale and H.sabdariffa. This finding suggests potential herb-drug interactions,warranting further research in humans or human livermicrosomes (729).6 Policy implicationsThe Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) reports that Ethiopia iscurrently experiencing a triple burden of diseases affecting peopleof all ages, with non-communicable diseases (NCDs)contributing significantly. The proportion of NCDs has increasedfrom 17% to 35% over the past 20 years. Key risk factorscontributing to the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lostinclude malnutrition, dietary risks, alcohol use, and tobacco use.Younger age groups often exhibit higher rates of lifestyle-relatedrisk factors for chronic diseases, leading to increased prematuremortality. Adolescents are particularly prone to sedentarylifestyles. Additionally, nearly half of CVD patients lack sufficientknowledge about CV risk factors. There remains a need forongoing lifestyle and health-related behavior modification (730).In Ethiopia, the national prevalence of HTN and DM in 2022was found to be 19.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Significant regionalvariations were noted, with the highest prevalence of HTN in AddisAbaba (30.6%) and DM in the Somali region (8.7%) (731). Toaddress these issues, the FMoH aims to increase the proportionof hypertensive adults and DM patients with controlled BP andblood sugar levels from 26% to 60% and from 24% to 60%,respectively, by 2025. Additionally, the FMoH seeks to reduce therisk of premature mortality from major NCDs from 18% to 14%by the same year. The ministry plans to achieve these goalsthrough the implementation of policies, legislation, andregulations targeting unhealthy diets, khat use, tobacco, andalcohol consumption (730). We support these strategies, as highsalt and fat intake, micronutrient deficiencies, excessive alcoholconsumption, and smoking are known risk factors for NCDs,particularly CVDs, including HTN (4, 22). Furthermore, evidencesuggests that chewing khat can directly increase BP (130\u2013134).The FMoH promotes interventions to reduce exposure toenvironmental and occupational risk factors for NCDs (730).Nureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 57 frontiersin.orgHowever, mere promotion may not be sufficient to address criticalissues like sound and air pollution in Ethiopia. Research shows thatexposure to noise and air pollution, including toxins, radiation, andchemicals, can increase BP (732, 733). Therefore, this paperstrongly recommends that the Ethiopian government develop andenforce regulations on these environmental issues and implementintervention measures at the kebele level.One initiative by the FMoH to combat NCDs is thestrengthening of nutrition service delivery. They also plan toreduce the prevalence of unsafe and illegal food products in themarket from 40% to 30% (730). Ethiopia is rich in various plantswith nutritional and medicinal values, which the health sectorshould focus on. There is a growing interest in natural products,particularly those with antioxidant properties, for diseasemanagement. Recent dietary recommendations emphasizeincreasing the intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and reducingenergy-dense snacks. Diet is crucial for BP control, and dietaryapproaches to prevent HTN are gaining attention. Bioactivephytoconstituents in foods and MPs, such as alkaloids, peptides,flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and polyphenols, arerecognized for their preventive and therapeutic benefits for CVhealth. Nutraceuticals like curcumin, conjugated linolenic acid,psyllium fiber, and polyunsaturated FAs have also been noted fortheir anti-obesity effects (50, 595).Among dietary therapeutic strategies, using functional foodsthat offer health benefits beyond basic nutrition is a viable option(355). In Ethiopia, several anti-HTN plants, such as papaya (PawPaw Tree), Habhab (Watermelon), Tiringo (Citron), Tikur gebs(Black Barley), Telba (Flaxseed), Gebto (White Lupin), Shiferaw(Moringa), and avocado, are considered functional foods ornutraceuticals with various health-promoting effects. Edibleplants like Komtatie (bitter orange), Mekmeko (spinach rhubarb),and Dokma (water berry) also exhibit anti-HTN properties.Other anti-HTN plants, including Key shinkurt (Red onion),Nech shinkurt (Garlic), Lomi (Lemon and Lime), Dimbilal(Coriander), Roka (Tamarind), Tossign, Abish (Fenugreek),Zinjibil (Ginger), Ensilal (Fennel), Tikurazimud (Black cumin),Tenadam (Rue), Sigametebesha (Rosemary), and Qundo berbere(Pepper tree), are traditionally used as condiments, spices, orflavoring agents in Ethiopian cuisine. Additionally, Kedkedie(sour tea), a traditional beverage and dietary therapy for high BP,shows potential as a nutraceutical and dietary additive for HTNmanagement (636).In addition to their anti-HTN effects, many of the mentionedplants exhibit antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiproliferative,and other beneficial activities. These plants have demonstratedefficacy against various conditions, including DM, AS, DL, HTN,obesity, and cancer. Several of these plants are high in dietaryfiber, and their intake has been inversely associated with CHDand stroke. Healthful snacking with lower-energy-density foodslike watermelon and papaya can enhance satiety and reduceoverall energy intake, helping to manage weight.Given that these plants are consumed as food or used incooking, they are expected to have low toxicity and onlymoderate side effects. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awarenessabout the benefits of these potential food supplements,nutraceuticals, and MPs for reducing NCDs in Ethiopia,especially among pre-diabetic or pre-hypertensive individuals.Increasing their cultivation, preferably in organic forms, wouldbe beneficial for the country\u2019s health.In Ethiopia, there is a concerted effort to strengthen theintegration of modern medicine and TM by implementingactivities to incorporate TM into primary health care. Strategicactivities include (1) improving the conservation anddocumentation of MPs and TM knowledge and practices, (2)promoting research and development of TMs, including clinicaltrials, and engaging academia and research institutions, and (3)establishing an incubation center for the laboratory formulationof scientifically validated TMs (730).This review highlights the importance of these activities.Academia and research institutions should focus on developinganti-HTN vegetables, fruits, and cereals into herbal supplementsin forms such as capsules, pills, or tablets. Commercial productslike Kedkedie (sour tea) are already available as dietarysupplements (295). Employing food technologies such as spraydrying and freeze-drying to enhance and preserve the L-citrullinecontent in watermelon can make its consumption moreconvenient, potentially improving adherence to daily intake.Watermelon microencapsulation could offer a more effectivemethod for improving vascular health in individuals withcardiometabolic risk factors (235).Microencapsulation involves packaging extracts and activeingredients in microparticle matrices to create a physical barrierthat controls the release of the active compounds. For example,microencapsulated Moringa leaf extract has demonstratedsignificant anti-hyperglycemic, vasodilator, and diuretic activities(409). Nanotechnology drug delivery systems show promise inCV studies due to their improved pharmacokinetic profiles,biocompatibility, low toxicity, and greater efficiency in targetingmitochondrial dysfunctions. Incorporating Moringa leaf extractwith silver nanoparticles has been shown to enhance anti-oxidantactivity (386).Utilizing MPs in the form of oils can be highly effective. Forexample, the essential oil extracted from Nana (spearmint) hasshown significant bioactivity, including antioxidant andantiproliferative effects. This suggests that such bioactive oilscould be valuable in both pharmaceutical industries and foodproduction technologies (382).The use of plant proteins in therapeutic applications is also onthe rise. Peptides derived from food proteins, such as those withACEI and \u03b1-amylase inhibition activities, are promisingingredients for functional foods. Hydrolysis of plant proteins,such as those from Ayderke (Physic nut), using enzymaticsystems like alcalase, results in bioactive hydrolysates with ACEIactivity (328). Similarly, Moringa protein hydrolysate and blackcumin seed proteins have demonstrated anti-HTN effectsthrough ACEI activity (5, 427).Given the diverse MP resources in Ethiopia, academic andresearch organizations should advocate for networkingpharmacology. Establishing reverse pharmacology andnetworking pharmacology laboratories, along with collaborationwith international institutions, could enhance the application ofNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 58 frontiersin.orgMPs. Training, workshops, and conferences on these topics wouldbe beneficial for advancing research and practical applications inEthiopia.7 Limitation of the studyUnpublished data from MSc theses and PhD dissertations wereexcluded from this paper due to ethical concerns. Strict exclusioncriteria were avoided to offer readers the most comprehensiveinformation and to acknowledge the efforts of the researchers.Many of the studies reviewed did not involve the isolation,structural elucidation, or characterization of bioactivecompounds. Additionally, clinical trials on the MPs studied arescarce, and there is a lack of multiple anti-HTN evaluations andexploration of the mechanisms of action for the extracts andcompounds of these plants.8 ConclusionIn Ethiopia\u2019s TM, plants play a crucial role in healing,particularly among patients with CV conditions who often turnto herbal remedies more than other forms of complementary andalternative medicine. This research highlights that several MPswith natural compounds have been identified and studied fortheir potential in developing anti-HTN drugs. Evidence-basedapproaches are increasingly incorporating these herbs and plantsin the prevention and Rx of CVDs. Most research focuses on theeffects and mechanisms of these plant extracts using in vitro, invivo, and ex vivo models. The main anti-HTN mechanismsidentified include antioxidant properties, vasorelaxation, NOproduction, CCB, K+-channel activation, suppression of RAAS,intracellular cGMP activation, diuretic effects, and SNSinhibition. Given these diverse mechanisms, herbal medicines arelikely to attract more attention in the future, although theircurrent use is hindered by a lack of sufficient clinical trials.Educating patients about the safety and benefits of herbs likeblack cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, watermelon, fennel,moringa, avocado, rue, tossing, and fenugreek is important.Among the plants studied, less than half have had their bioactivecompounds fully characterized. Promising compounds for anti-HTN therapy include chlorogenic acid, achyranthine, quercetin,allicin, hesperidin, diosmetin, citral, hibiscus acid, eriocitrin,isoorientin, gramine, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, thymoquinone, luteolin, scirpusin B, chrysin, \u03b2-caryophyllene, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, \u03b3-sitosterol,diosgenin, gingerols, and \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene. Thepharmaceutical industry should focus on developing effectivedrug candidates from these phytochemicals. The demonstratedanti-HTN properties of these MPs underscore the importance oftraditional knowledge in HTN Rx. However, around 35 MPsdiscussed in this review have not been tested for their BP-lowering effects. More research is needed on these plants,including studies on their pharmacological activities, mechanismsof action, bioactive compounds, toxicology, and large-scaleclinical trials to confirm their potential in addressing HTN-related conditions and mortality.9 Future development directionsTraditional botanical studies on MPs highlight newopportunities for investigating their anti-HTN properties.Therefore, thorough ethnobotanical surveys are needed torecord indigenous knowledge of MPs used to treat HTN. Byscientifically validating this traditional knowledge, we candiscover new anti-HTN compounds. It is essential tocollaborate with local healers and communities to safeguardthese traditional practices, potentially by creating digitalrecords of MPs, their applications, and preparation methods.However, the growing demand for MPs in herbalmedicine and drug development poses a risk to theirsustainability. Thus, it is vital to protect endangered,vulnerable, and overexploited species for future generations,who will be better equipped to manage and utilize theseresources responsibly.Plant-derived natural compounds have long been, and willremain, crucial as sources of therapeutic agents and as modelsfor designing, semisynthesizing, and synthesizing drugs fortreating both human and animal diseases. We recommendfurther studies to assess the pharmacological properties andpotential toxic effects of extracts and isolated secondarymetabolites from these plants. It is anticipated that plants willcontinue to produce novel biomolecules, leading to the discoveryof innovative Rxs for CVDs. Additional bioactivity-guidedfractionation, identification, and characterization of thesesecondary metabolites should be pursued. Investigating therelationship between the chemical structures of phytochemicalsand their biological activity can enhance drug development orsynthetic alterations. Comprehensive pharmacological studies arealso needed to understand how extracts and bioactivecompounds lower HTN. Screening these extracts and compoundsfor synergistic effects in combination with other plants or anti-HTN drugs is essential. A repository of phytochemicals withanti-HTN potential should be created to facilitate syntheticmodifications or pharmaceutical applications. After success inpreclinical studies, clinical trials must be conducted to confirmtheir effectiveness in humans. Future research, includingextended randomized trials, could help clarify the long-termeffects of MPs.Nutraceutical products can be developed from MPs bystandardizing their extracts or powders for use in dietarysupplements and functional foods. These nutraceuticals shouldbe promoted not only for HTN management but also for theirbroader health benefits, such as antiinflammatory andantioxidant effects. Additionally, incorporating thesenutraceuticals into national dietary guidelines can supportpreventive healthcare through local biodiversity. Ensuring thesafety and non-toxic nature of MPs while identifying potentialadverse effects or contraindications is essential. To addresscurrent challenges, accelerating drug discovery by mergingNureye et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1514911Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 59 frontiersin.orgethnopharmacology with modern computational tools is crucial.The use of reverse pharmacology on traditional MPs andintegrating network pharmacology to understand complexbiological interactions is strongly recommended for advancingdrug discovery today.Author contributionsDN: Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation,Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation,Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review &editing.
