R.Ghogare Science College, affiliated with Karmveer in Dhule,Maharashtra.Extraction of Plant MaterialAbutilon indicum leaves were processed into aqueous,ethanol, and chloroform extracts following themethodologyoutlined in the Indian Pharmacopoeia . After washing theleaves with running tap water, they were air-dried in theshade and then underwent Soxhlet extraction. A total of 50grams of leaf powder was subjected to 24-hour extractionwith aqueous, ethanol, and chloroform solvents using theaforementioned apparatus. The obtained extracts were safelystore in sealed containers and kept in a refrigerator at 4\u25e6C forfurther investigation.Thin layer chromatographyThin-layer chromatography of various extracts involves thefollowing steps: Creating the TLC plate involved makingslurry of gel \u2019G\u2019 with distilled water, applying a 0.25mm thicklayer to glass plates. Following air-drying for 10 minutes,the plates are then heated in a hot air oven at 105\u25e6C for 30proceedings to activate them.Preparing the sample solution involved creating a0.1% solution of the aqueous extract, and any suspendedimpurities were filtered off. Choosing the solvent system:Thechoice of the solvent system or mobile phase influences theseparation process. Solvents, selected based on their differentpolarity, were prepared as binary, ternary, or quaternarysystems with a constant composition to achieve effectiveseparation. Saturation of TLC chamber: Solvents were filledin a chamber up to a height of approximately 15 cm andmarked. The chamber was lined with filter paper soakedin solvent, ensuring uniform distribution of solvent vaporsthroughout the vapor space, thereby saturating the chamber.Application of spots: The prepared sample solution of theextract was applied to one end of the plate, approximately 1.5cm from the bottom3,4.Fig. 2: TLC of 3 different extract of Abutilon indicumDevelopment of chromatogramThe plates were carefully placed into a pre-saturated TLCchamber, ensuring that the solvent saturated the TLClayer below the starting line.
