ofbotany, application, processing,phytochemistry, quality control,pharmacology, and toxicologyYule Hao, Jiawen Qi, Xinggui Huang, Chenhao Liu and Yi Liu*School of Basic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, ChinaEuodiae Fructus (EF) is the dried and nearly ripe fruit of Euodia rutaecarpa, firstrecorded in Shen Nong\u2019s Herbal Classic. EF is a versatile Traditional ChineseMedicine (TCM) known for the effects of dispelling colds and alleviating pain,suppressing adverse qi to relieve vomiting, and boosting yang to mitigatediarrhea. However, it should be noted that EF possesses mild toxicity. In TCMprescriptions, EF is employed to treat various ailments, including abdominal pain,diarrhea, chronic non-atrophic gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and primarydysmenorrhea. This review collected the literature published before September2024 on EF. An exhaustive analysis of EF literature was conducted utilizingmultiple sources, namely classic TCM books and various scientific databaseslike Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, ACS, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, andChinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. So far, more than 300 metaboliteshave been extracted and identified from EF, exhibiting various pharmacologicaleffects, such as cardiovascular protection, gastrointestinal protection,neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, analgesia, anti-tumor, glucose and lipidmetabolism regulation, etc. It also exhibits diverse toxicological properties andposes specific toxic risks to the liver, heart, and kidney. Nonetheless, research isscarce regarding the toxicology of EF, especially on its cardiotoxicity andnephrotoxicity. Further in-depth research is necessary to explore themechanisms underlying EF\u2019s pharmacological and toxicological mechanismsand to develop strategies for quality control and toxicity mitigation. Thetoxicity of EF can be reduced by processing, but this aspect is rarelydiscussed, and the quality control needs to be further standardized.Evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and limonin are the effective metabolites of EF andare also one of the causes of EF toxicity. The pharmacological effects ofevodiamine and rutaecarpine have been intensely studied, but there are fewstudies on limonin and other metabolites of EF. Therefore, this paper focuses onthe botanical characteristics, traditional applications, processing methods,phytochemistry, quality control, pharmacology, and toxicology of EF. We hopethis paper provides a theoretical basis for the future high-value and high-connotation development of EF.KEYWORDSEuodiae Fructus, traditional uses, processing, phytochemistry, quality control,pharmacology, toxicologyOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYMicha\u0142 Tomczyk,Medical University of Bialystok, PolandREVIEWED BYMichael Heinrich,University College London, United KingdomXianyu Li,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences,China*CORRESPONDENCEYi Liu,tcmly@163.comRECEIVED 10 October 2024ACCEPTED 14 January 2025PUBLISHED 29 January 2025CITATIONHao Y, Qi J, Huang X, Liu C and Liu Y (2025)Euodiae Fructus: a review of botany,application, processing, phytochemistry, qualitycontrol, pharmacology, and toxicology.Front.

It relieves cold and pain, suppresses adverse qito relieve vomiting, and enhances yang to stop diarrhea. Nonetheless, itis essential to acknowledge that EF has a slight toxic effect. EF ranksamong the most prevalent botanical drugs clinically in TCM, boasts ahistory of more than 2000 years, and has been formally listed in variouseditions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP) (https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/).Lately, numerous studies have concentrated on examining themetabolites, pharmacological effects, clinical function, and toxicologyof EF. Up to this point, more than 300 metabolites have been extractedand pinpointed from EF (Xiao et al., 2023). Contemporary researchindicates that EF\u2019s primary active elements comprise alkaloids,terpenoids, flavonoids, volatile oils, and other compounds (Liu L.et al., 2020). Among them, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and limoninare characteristic metabolites (Tian et al., 2019). Research inpharmacology reveals that EF, along with its raw extract and refinedform, offers a range of pharmacological effects, such as cardiovascularprotection, gastrointestinal protection, neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, analgesia, anti-tumor, and glucose and lipidmetabolism regulation. In clinical settings, this medication serves asboth a supplement and a substitute treatment for conditions likeabdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, hypertension,eczema, and oral ulcers (Huang et al., 2021). EF, combined withvarious botanical drugs, is effective in gastrointestinal diseases,headaches, vomiting, skin diseases, dysentery, menorrhagia, andpostpartum hemorrhage (Li D. et al., 2022).However, it is important to recognize that excessive use of EFmay lead to stomach pain, vomiting, blurred vision, and other toxicsymptoms (Cai et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2018). As EF\u2019s clinicalapplication has expanded, its toxicity has become increasinglyapparent. It is widely accepted among scholars that the toxicityof EF may be attributed to reactive metabolites (RMs) produced bythe metabolic activation of evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and limonin(He et al., 2024). Studies have demonstrated that different parts ofEF can induce varying degrees of hepatic injury in rats (Liu et al.,2015), and EF has obvious toxic damage to the human liver (Teschkeet al., 2014). Some studies have also highlighted the heart and kidneyas possible focal points for EF toxicity. Yet, investigations into EFcardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity processes are scarce andinsufficient for the specific toxic risks and potential disadvantagesof EF. Exploring the toxic metabolites of EF and methods formitigating its toxicity is crucial to guiding safe clinical use. Thispaper reviews the plant morphology, traditional application,processing, phytochemistry, quality control, pharmacology,toxicology, monitoring, and prevention of EF. Particularemphasis is placed on discussing the mechanisms of EF-inducedcardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, strategies for reducing andcontrolling EF\u2019s toxicity, and preventive measures for clinicalmonitoring.2 BotanyThe ChP recorded the dried and nearly ripe fruit of three plantsof the genus Euodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. (ER), Euodiarutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. officinalis (Dode) Huang (ERO),Euodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. bodinieri (Dode) Huang(ERB). Euodia rutaecarpa is also divided into large grains andsmall grains. ER primarily supplies large grains, categorized intolarge EF flowers (LEF) and medium EF flowers (MEF). LEF hasreached full ripeness, the fruit shows cracks, and its effectiveness issubpar. Approximately seven mature MEFs, characterized by ayellowish-green and potent odor, are commonly utilized inmedical treatments. ERO and ERB primarily supply diminutivegrains, predominantly consisting of small EF flowers (SEF), oftenimmature and green. The diminutive size of ERO and ERB fruitstypically classifies them as ER varieties, distinct from ER due to theirunique, strong smells. The botanical characteristics of ER, ERO, andERB are similar to those of dried fruits, as shown in Figure 1.The Euodia rutaecarpa are shrubs or trees, standing 3\u20135 m high,and are thickly adorned with grayish yellow, rust-red downy hair orhave few hairs and dark purplish-red shoots. The leaves have5\u201311 leaflets, ovate, elliptic, or lanceolate, 6\u201318 cm long and3\u20137 cm wide. Inflorescences are terminal and dioecious. Maleinflorescence flowers are separated from each other, with petalsmeasuring 3\u20134 mm long. Female inflorescences are dense or distant,and petals measure 4\u20135 mm long. Most of the sepals and petals are5 pieces, occasionally 4 pieces, arranged in a pincer pattern. The fruitis spherical or slightly pentagonal oblate, and the surface is darkgreenish, yellow, or brown. The outer pericarp has oil spots. Theinner pericarp is a thin shell or woody, waxy yellow or brown, andthe ovary can be seen as 5-located with 1 seed per mericarp. At itspeak is a star-shaped fissure with five points, while its base features acalyx and a fruit stalk and is adorned with yellow hairs. The quality ishard and crisp, with a full green color and rich aroma is better.However, the botanical characteristics of ER, ERO, and ERB aredifferent in growth form, maturity period, ecological environment,and resource distribution, as shown in Table 1.Euodia rutaecarpa cultivation began at the end of the EasternHan Dynasty.Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians (Wei andJin Dynasties, A.D. 220\u2013450) first recorded that \u201cEuodia rutaecarpais grown in the valley, picked on September 9, kept cool and dry, andkept as long as possible\u201d. EF had become a widely used medicineduring the Tang Dynasty, with renowned poet Wang Wei notingthat Euodia rutaecarpa could be seen throughout mountains duringthe Double Ninth Festival. Contemporary research indicates thatEuodia rutaecarpa thrives in sunlit, warm environments, typicallyflourishing in thinly spread forests or shrubs in mountainous areasranging from flat to 1,500m above sea level, predominantly on sunlitinclines. It is relatively cold resistant, but in cold, windy, and dryareas in winter, and in areas with many diseases, the results are low,and the growth is poor. Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica (SongDynasty, A.D. 960\u20131,279) recorded that \u201cEuodia rutaecarpa can befound everywhere, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan.Jiangxi is EF\u2019s the authentic origin, rich in high-quality MEF. Itis distributed in the north and south of Jiangxi Province, mainly inurban Zhangshu, Fengcheng, Gaoan, Xingan, Xiajiang, Xinyu, andJishui. As clinical needs swiftly rose, numerous provinces introducedEuodia rutaecarpa. Now, it is distributed in the south of the QinlingMountains in China, mainly in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, andYunnan Provinces (Figure 2). Nowadays, Euodia rutaecarpa ispredominantly thrived in Asia, East Africa, and Oceania, withextensive cultivation in ancient Japan and Korea. EuodiaFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032rutaecarpa was introduced in Korea during The Three KingdomsPeriod, and the Goryeo Master Fang (Wei and Jin Dynasties, A.D.220\u2013420) recorded the treatment of beriberi with EF (Nam et al.,2016). Euodia rutaecarpa was introduced in Japan during theEdogawa period. EF and its namesake, Goshuyuto (known asWuzhuyu decoction in Chinese), are frequently utilized inclinical settings (Hibino et al., 2009a).3 Traditional applications3.1 The drug application of EFEF was first recorded in Shen Nong\u2019s Herbal Classic, whichrecords the nature, taste, meridian tropism, and efficacy of EF, layingthe foundation for the modern clinical application of EF. Over time,the therapeutic impact of EF has evolved through extensive research.It is pointed out that EF can treat many diseases, such as Jueyinheadache, hernia, abdominal pain, beriberi, vomiting blood, acidregurgitation, and diarrhea (Table 2). Concurrently, MiscellaneousRecords of Famous Physicians initially documented EF\u2019s mildtoxicity, with ongoing research enhancing EF\u2019s toxicology.Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica recorded that EF harms theeyes and hair. Amplified Herbology (Song Dynasty, A.D. 960\u20131,279)recorded that EF damages the intestines and stomach. Correlationbetween Materia Medica Companion (Ming Dynasty, A.D.1,368\u20131,644) recorded that EF damages the healthy atmosphere.Mouth ulcers, tongue sores, and dizziness caused by excessiveconsumption of EF are recorded in Compendium of MateriaMedica (Ming Dynasty, A.D. 1,368\u20131,644). The ChP recorded theminor toxicity of EF and stipulated that the dosage of EF was 2\u20135 g.3.2 The classic prescription application of EFEF has been a staple in clinical prescriptions since antiquity(Table 3). Wuzhuyu decoction, named after the monarch medicineEF in Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Dong Han Dynasty, A.D.25\u2013220), has the effect of warming the middle to replenishdeficiency, lowering qi and stopping vomiting. It was the earliestrecord of the use of EF in clinical treatment. Synopsis of the GoldenChamber (Dong Han Dynasty, A.D. 25\u2013220) mentioned twice theEF of warming channels, dispelling cold, and stopping vomiting,which is an important medicine for tonifying the spleen andstomach. Among the over 5,000 prescriptions in Thousand-GoldEssential Formula for Emergency (Tang Dynasty, A.D. 618\u2013907),FIGURE 1The above-ground portion (A), leaves (B), flowers (C), fruits (D), ER (E), ERO (F), ERB (G), LEF (H), MEF (I) and SEF (J) of Euodia rutaecarpa.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032there were 143 prescriptions mentioned EF. The Essential Secretsfrom the Imperial Library (Tang Dynasty, A.D. 618\u2013907) had over6,000 prescriptions, and the number of prescriptions contained EFreached 176. Formula of Peaceful Beneuolence Pharmacy (SongDynasty, A.D. 1,078\u20131,085) was the first official preparationstandard. This book recorded a total of 788 prescriptions, and13 referred to EF. In the clinical realm, essential formulasfeaturing EF encompass the Wuzhuyu Decoction, Zuojin Pill,Wenjing Decoction, and Sishen Pill, among others.In addition to examining EF in traditional medical texts, thestudy of EF in botanical drugs has been extensively explored incontemporary medical settings. Wuzhuyu Decoction can treatchronic non-atrophic gastritis (Hu et al., 2023), chronic migraine(Pan et al., 2015; Nan et al., 2022), alcoholic gastric ulcer (Wang X.et al., 2023), and atherosclerosis (Li C. et al., 2022). Zuojin Pill haspharmacological effects such as anti-tumor (Peng et al., 2015),protection of gastric mucosa, anti-inflammation, anti-ulcer, andso on (Wang et al., 2015; Zhang J. et al., 2022). It can treat bilereflux gastritis (Li Y. Y. et al., 2022) and septic lung injury (Yin et al.,2021). Wenjing Decoction can treat primary dysmenorrhea (Gaoet al., 2017) and endometriosis (Huang et al., 2023). Sishen Pill hasanti-inflammatory and anti-tumor pharmacological effects (ZhangB. et al., 2024), can treat abdominal pain, diarrhea (Li et al., 2024),irritable bowel syndrome (Zhang X. Y. et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2024),and insomnia (Wang L. X. et al., 2023). EF is recommended as theprimary treatment in Japan for ailments like cold headaches,dysmenorrhea, and inflammatory pain in rheumatoid joints(https://www.mhlw.go.jp/index.html). Certain EF-containingprescriptions, including Changkang Tablets, Huatuo Zaizao Wan,Compound Berberine Tablets, and Jiawei Zuo Jin Wan, haveundergone extensive research and clinical application. ChangkangTablets are used in the treatment of dysentery, abdominal pain, andtenesmus (Shi et al., 2013; Guan et al., 2020), Huatuo Zaizao Wancan treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Jiang et al., 2023) and stroke (Duanet al., 2017).4 Phytochemistry of EFPresently, about 300 metabolites of EF have been isolated andpurified, which are mainly divided into alkaloids (1\u2013148), terpenoids(149\u2013184), flavonoids (185\u2013213), volatile oils (214\u2013283), and others(284\u2013299). These metabolites are summarized in SupplementaryTable S1, and their structures are shown in Supplementary FiguresS1\u2013S8. The alkaloids are primarily categorized into indoles andquinolones (Li D. W. et al., 2020). Evodiamine and rutaecarpine inindole are the index metabolites of EF. The limonin in terpenoidsplays a crucial role in EF.4.1 AlkaloidsAlkaloids are the metabolites of EF, mainly composed of indoles(Supplementary Figure S1) and quinolones (Supplementary FigureTABLE 1 The differences in botanical descriptions between three plants.Plant Botanical morphology Mature period EcologicalenvironmentResource distributionER Odd-pinnate compound leaves opposite,leaflets thin to thick papery, ovate or elliptic,apex abruptly narrowed into mucronate,base cuneate to broadly cuneate or rounded,entire margin or indistinctly serrate, lateralveins indistinct, both sides are yellowishbrown puberulent, especially on veins, withdistinct large and numerous oil spots.

Alkaloids fundamentally possess a circular form and are non-soluble in water, resulting in a higher concentration of EF alkaloidsin ethanol. Indoles are synthesized mainly through methanesulfonicacid and amino acids. Over ten different compounds, includingevodiamine, rutaecarpine, and dehydroevodiamine, were extractedfrom EF (Zuo et al., 2000; Wang Q. Z. et al., 2010; Wang T. Y. et al.,2010; Wang X. X. et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zhao N. et al., 2015; Maet al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021; Zhao X. M. et al., 2021). Evodiamine andrutaecarpine are the most important metabolites, and their contentsare also the highest in EF (Huang et al., 2019; Li D. W. et al., 2020).Dihydroevocarpine and evocarpine are the crucial metabolites ofquinolones found in EF (Li Y. H. et al., 2020). Furthermore, thegroup includes quinolines, organic amines, acridone, and purines(Minh et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2022) (Supplementary Figure S3).Research revealed a reduction in the levels of evodiamine,rutaecarpine, and carpine in EF correlating with the fruit\u2019sdiminution. Some commercial evodiamine and rutaecarpine inSEF are below the content specified in ChP (Cao et al., 2019).4.2 TerpenoidsTypically, terpenoids (Supplementary Figure S4) originate frommethylpentanedioic acid, with isoprene forming the fundamentalstructural component of the molecular framework (Zhao H. et al.,2021; Qian et al., 2014). Limonin is an oxidized tetracyclic triterpenewith a distinctive furan ring, and it is a terpenoid extracted andrecognized from EF. They constitute the material basis of the bitterproperties of EF (Bae et al., 2020). Its representative metabolites arelimonin and rutaevine, and limonin is another index metabolite ofEF. In addition, there are high contents of metabolites, such asevodol, obacunone, rutaevine acetate, 6\u03b2-acetoxy-5-epillimonin,FIGURE 2Cultivation and distribution of Euodia Rutaecarpa in China.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032jangomolide, and shihulimonin A (Lacroix et al., 2011). Due to theirsignificant solubility in fats, terpenoids are typically processed usingan ethanol solvent. Research indicates that limonin levels in SEF andMEF are notably elevated, approximately 0.74% and 0.65%,respectively, in contrast to LEF\u2019s mere 0.24% limonin content(Zhang et al., 2021c).4.3 FlavonoidsFlavonoids (Supplementary Figure S5) generally refer to a series ofmetabolites formed by connecting two benzene rings with three carbonatoms. EF additionally has a higher content of flavonoids. It mainlyincludes these three metabolites: flavonoids and their glycosides,flavonols and their glycosides, and flavonones and their glycosides.Flavonoids and their glycosides are predominantly associated withO-glucose, O-xylose, O-galactose, O-rhamnose, O-rue sugar, andO-mulberry disaccharide. Flavonols and their glycosides mainlyinclude quercetin, isorhamnetin, limocitrin glycosides, and aglycones(Xiao et al., 2023; He et al., 2024). Flavonones and their glycosides arephellodensin F, catechin, and hesperidin, respectively (Zhao Z. et al.,2015; Li and Wang, 2020).4.4 Volatile oilEF has a strong and fragrant smell because of its high content ofvolatile oil (Supplementary Figure S6). The volatile oil metabolitesare monoterpene, sesquiterpene, aliphatic, and aromatic. Within theisolated volatile oil, the proportions of sesquiterpenes exceed 38%,monoterpenes surpass 35%, and esters exceed 13% (Liu S. S. et al.,2019). Furthermore, while EF volatile oil exhibits significantpharmacological properties, it simultaneously constitutes a toxicmetabolite of EF. Its metabolites are monoterpenoids, such asmyrcene and (E)-ocimene, and sesquiterpenes, such as \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b2-elemene.4.5 OthersEF also contains some organic acids (Supplementary Figure S7),including caffeic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, trans-caffeoylgluconic acid, and feruloylgluconic acid. EF also containsphenylpropanoids, mainly divided into simple phenylpropanoids,coumarins, and lignans, most of which belong to simplephenylpropanoids. Simple phenylpropanoids includeTABLE 2 The traditional uses of EF in China.Traditional uses Dynasty/YearsReferencesWarming the middle to dispel colds, relieve cough, remove dampness, and stop arthralgia Eastern Han Dynasty Shen Nong\u2019s Herbal ClassicI\u795e\u519c\u672c\u8349\u7ecfJDispelling phlegm, relieving heartache, and reconciling the five internal organs Wei and JinDynastiesMiscellaneous Records of Famous PhysiciansI\u540d\u533b\u522b\u5f55JKilling insects and warming Yang Tang Dynasty A Supplement to Materia MedicaI\u672c\u8349\u62fe\u9057JWarming the spleen, promoting digestion and defecation.

coniferin, chlorogenic acid,etc. Besides the metabolites mentioned above, EF also containsanthraquinones, such as chrysophanol, emodin, and physcion,and steroids, such as \u03b2-sitosterol, \u03b2-daucosterol, and \u03b2-stigmasterol (Supplementary Figure S8).5 Processing5.1 Traditional processing methodsProcessing is the essence of TCM application, which canincrease the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of drugs. EF\u2019sprocessing boasts an extensive historical background, with rawEF typically exerting a significant influence in heating the spleenand eliminating cold. The long traditional technology of processingEF with licorice is pointed out in the Synopsis of the GoldenChamber. Master Lei\u2019s Treatise on Drug Processing (Northern andSouthern Dynasties, A.D. 420\u2013479) recorded that EF is processedwith salt to enhance the analgesic effect and vinegar to correct thetaste. Materia Medica for Dietotherapy (Tang Dynasties, A.D.618\u2013907) recorded that EF could enhance the antiemetic effectafter processing ginger and the analgesic effect after beingprocessed with yellow rice wine. General Records of HolyUniversal Relief (Song Dynasties, A.D. 1,078\u20131,085) recorded thatEF can reduce toxicity when processed with soybean products.Prescriptions for Universal Relief (Ming Dynasty, A.D.1,368\u20131,644) recorded that EF fried with Psoraleae Fructus canenhance the antidiarrheal effect. Wonderful Well-Tried Recipes(Ming Dynasty, A.D. 1,368\u20131,644) recorded that EF processedwith Coptidis Rhizoma can enhance the antiemetic effect. Theprocess and method of processing EF with licorice are describedin detail in ChP (Figure 3). In addition, different doses of licorice canaffect EF\u2019s chemical composition and pharmacological effects (Xiaoet al., 2012). Certain academics have experimented with varying theEF to licorice dosage ratios, discovering the optimal 100:6.5.2 Enhance efficiency and reduce toxicityIn its extended clinical application, TCM has developed distincttheories and techniques for detoxifying and improving its healingimpact, encompassing both processing and compatibility (Li R. L.et al., 2021). Special processing techniques such as licorice, salt,ginger, and vinegar can reduce the toxicity of EF. The ChP stipulatesthat EF ought to be fried alongside licorice. Some scholars havefound that processing EF with licorice can reduce the toxicity ofalkaloids (Ren et al., 2023a). The cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP)enzyme activates evodiamine in EF during metabolism, which leadsto liver injury and inflammation. Licorice can reduce the toxicity ofEF by inhibiting the P450 enzyme and blocking the metabolicactivation of EF (Ren et al., 2024). Licorice can obstruct EFprotein coupling by suppressing the P450 enzyme, elevating GSHlevels in human liver cells, and mitigating the GSH reductioninduced by EF (Ren et al., 2023b). Salt-processed EF canintroduce drugs into the kidney channel, reduce toxicity, andensure the safety of clinical drug use (Hou et al., 2023). WhenEF is combined with ginger, its antiemetic properties can beamplified. Some studies found that EF processed with ginger,licorice, and salt had better antitoxic effects (Zhang M. et al.,2021). Other studies found that the three processing methods ofginger, licorice, and vinegar could reduce the content of rutaecarpinein EF, with vinegar processing increasing the content of evodiamine,and licorice processing had the most significant effect on reducingtoxicity (Li H. et al., 2021). The metabolites of EF obtained bydifferent processing methods, such as stir-frying, roasting, andsteaming, are also different (Xiao et al., 2023). A comparativestudy of various EF-processed products revealed that theTABLE 3 (Continued) Traditional application of EF in classic prescriptions.Classification FormulanameMain compositions Dosageform\u2022 Traditionalefficacy\u25aa ClinicalapplicationsEF\u2019s function ReferencesCompoundBerberineTabletsBerberine hydrochloride, EuodiaeFructus, Aucklandiae Radix,Paeoniae Radix AlbaPill \u2022 Heat-clearing, damp-drying, stoppingdysentery and diarrhea\u25aa Acute gastroenteritis,dysentery and chronicdiarrheaWarming channel,dispelling cold andpromote bloodcirculationChinesepharmacopoeiaI\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5178JFIGURE 3Flow chart of processing EF with licorice.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032combined amounts of evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and evodol in EFfor stir-frying exceed those in baking and cooking.EF combined with other drugs can also counteract its toxicity.For example, the toxicity of EF significantly decreased when EF wasused in combination with licorice and jujube (He et al., 2024). EFwith Coptidis Rhizoma can enhance the anti-inflammatory effectand inhibit the inflammatory reaction in RAW264.7 cells bysignificantly reducing the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 (WangJ. et al., 2024). Additionally, it is capable of markedly reducingapoptosis and enhancing the defensive role of the gastric mucosathrough the suppression of gastric acid release (Zhang Z. et al.,2024). Berberine is an important metabolite of Coptidis Rhizoma,which can counteract the side effects of evodiamine and reduce therisk of evodiamine in treating gastric cancer (Shi et al., 2013). Thecombination of berberine and evodiamine can synergistically inhibitthe proliferation of human breast cancer cells by inducing cell cyclearrest and apoptosis (Du et al., 2017). The researchers found that EFcombined with ginger, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, PaeoniaeRadix Alba, and Angelicae Sinensis Radix can improve theefficacy of EF (Wu et al., 2021).6 Quality control6.1 Quality standard of EF in ChPWith the continuous updating of the edition of ChP, theidentification, content evaluation, testing technology, and qualitystandards of EF are constantly improving (Table 4). EF was firstrecorded in the 1963 edition of ChP, and it was clearly recorded thatEF was processed with licorice. Then, the identification method ofEF appeared for the first time in the 1973 edition of ChP. In the1985 edition of ChP, the EF identification method was officiallydetermined as hydrochloric acid filtration, potassium mercuriciodide de-precipitation, and the formation of a reddish-brownring zone at the interface between dimethylaminobenzaldehydeand EF solution. The ChP has been improving the qualitycontrol of EF since 2000. For the first time, the determinationmethod and the lowest value of EF appeared in the 2000 editionof ChP, which stipulates that the total amount of evodiamine andrutaecarpine should not be less than 0.2%. Next, the total amount ofevodiamine and rutaecarpine should not be less than 0.15% in the2005 edition of ChP. Limonin content is adjusted to no less than1.0% in the 2010 edition of ChP. Limonin content is again adjustedto no less than 0.20% in the 2015 edition of ChP. The 2015 edition ofChP is basically consistent with the 2020 edition of ChP, indicatingthat the metabolites of EF are relatively stable and can betterrepresent the efficacy of EF. However, the maximum referencedose of metabolites is not specified in ChP, and the toxicity ofEF has not been reasonably controlled.6.2 Exploration of modern quality controlTCM\u2019s effectiveness can differ significantly based on the type ofplant, its source, and yield. Diverse environmental factors like soil,air quality, precipitation, and sunlight play a crucial role in shapingEF growth, with each EF metabolite varying in content acrossregions (Liu Y. et al., 2019). Some studies have shown that themetabolite of EF varies greatly in different locations, and there islittle change in the metabolite of EF in different years in the samelocation (Huang et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010). By comparing the EFof different batches of LEF, MEF, and SEF, it was found that thelimonin content in SEF was higher than that of MEF and LEF, whilethe alkaloid content was higher in MEF and LEF. The toxicity of EFis related to the content ratio of limonin and alkaloid. The higher theratio, the lower the toxicity of EF. In other words, MEF is more toxicthan other categories, and SEF is less toxic than other categories(Zhang et al., 2021b). Furthermore, certain academics analyzed thefour vital metabolites of ER, ERO, and ERB, namely evodiamine,evodiamine, dehydroevodiamine, and narcissoside, discoveringcomparable levels of dehydroevodiamine. The content ofevodiamine, rutaecarpine, and narcissoside was the highest inERO and the lowest in ERB (Li C. H. et al., 2021).The ChP stipulated the detection method of EF and pointed outthat evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and limonin are the crucialmetabolites of EF. However, these three metabolites do notrepresent the overall pharmacological effects of EF. Consequently,sophisticated detection techniques are essential for qualitative andquantitative analysis of metabolites in EF.

At present, there are many studies on themetabolites of EF. Scholars have isolated three metabolites fromEF: rutaecarpine, evodiamine, and evodiamide (Zhou et al., 2006).Then, two new-lactone derivatives, evodinoids A and B, and a newvolatile oil, are separated from EF (Xin et al., 2022). In addition, fivemetabolites of EF were found. They are limonin, 1-methyl-2-undecyl-4(1H) quinolone, evocarpine, 1-methy-2-[(6Z,9Z)]-6,9-pentadecadienyl-4-(1H)-quinolone, and dihydroevocarpine(Zhang et al., 2013). It has been proven that evodiamine isclosely related to the hepatotoxicity of EF (Zhang et al., 2021b).Limonin serves as the primary liver-protective metabolite of EF,while evodiamine is the chief liver-damaging metabolite of EF.Subsequently, eleven critical metabolites of EF underwentanalysis using non-specific metabonomics and in vitro functionaltechniques (Yong et al., 2024). Up to this point, a total of17 metabolites have undergone screening from EF, includingneochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 3-O-feruloylquinic acid, hyperoside, quercetin-3-O-sambubioside,rutin, dehydroevodiamine, isorhamnetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactoside,narcissin, isorhamnetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, diosmin,rutaevine, limonin, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and evocarpine.7 Pharmacological effectsEF is a classical plant medicine with various pharmacologicaleffects, such as cardiovascular protection, gastrointestinalprotection, neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, analgesia, anti-tumor, glucose and lipid metabolism regulation, etc.(Supplementary Table S2). Evodiamine, rutaecarpine, andlimonin serve as the indicator metabolites of EF but are alsoabundant in phytochemistry and pharmacology, which are oftenused to treat diseases of the immune, nervous, digestive, circulatory,and endocrine systems. Elucidating the pharmacological effects ofEF is the key to guiding the rational clinical application of drugs andensuring the curative effect.7.1 Cardiovascular protectionEF has a cardiovascular protective effect, and its aqueousextract can contract the aorta (Hibino et al., 2009b). In managingcardiovascular conditions, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, andlimonin serve as crucial metabolites of EF, offering protectionagainst myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), anti-myocardialfibrosis, anti-arrhythmia, safeguarding vascular endothelialdamage, altering vascular tension, and so on. Studies haveshown that evodiamine has an anti-atherosclerotic effect, canregulate energy by inhibiting the expression of the \u03b21-adrenergicreceptor, and prevents cardiac I/R injury (Xue et al., 2015).Subsequently, evodiamine has the ability to control the growthand movement of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking thePI3K/AKT axis activation in the traditional route, therebypreventing atherosclerosis onset and progression (Zha et al.,2023). What\u2019s more, evodiamine can prevent isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis by regulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Huang et al., 2017). Moreover,rutaecarpine promotes endothelial nitric oxide synthase(eNOS) phosphorylation and NO synthesis via the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) andcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase \u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathwaysthrough transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1),and effectively prevent endothelial dysfunction (Lee et al., 2021).Rutaecarpine can also reduce the damage to myocardial cellscaused by myocardial infarction by enhancing vascular smoothmuscle calcification (Zhan et al., 2021). Some studies have shownthat limonin can inhibit adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity byactivating Nrf2 and SIRT2 signal pathways (Li X. H. et al., 2022).Limonin can also inhibit the ubiquitination and degradation ofSIRT6, stabilize the level of SIRT6 protein, promote itsexpression, reduce cardiac hypertrophy, and improve cardiacfunction (Liu et al., 2022).7.2 Gastrointestinal protectionEF is an effective botanical drug for treating gastrointestinaldiseases, especially evodiamine, rutaecarpine, anddehydroevodiamine (Chen et al., 2023). Evodiamine can act as anantioxidant by blocking the Rho/NF-\u03baB pathway and alleviatinggastric mucosal injury (Zhao Z. et al., 2015). It can also inhibitgastritis caused byHelicobacter pylori infection by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway (Yang et al., 2021). Then, evodiamine can effectivelyimprove the imbalance of intestinal microflora and relieve thesymptoms of ulcerative colitis by increasing the level oflactobacillus acidophilus and the production of acetate (Wanget al., 2020). In addition, it can suppress gastrointestinalhyperactivity caused by stress via cholecystokinin (CCK) and theCCK1 receptor (Ren et al., 2018). Moreover, rutaecarpine is effectivein mitigating gastric damage caused by ethanol through thesuppression of NF-\u03baB pathway anti-inflammation, Nrf2 pathwayantioxidation, stimulation of Bcl-2, suppression of Bax and caspase-3 expression, and prevention of gastric cell apoptosis (Ren et al.,2020). Some studies have shown that TRPV1/calcitonin gene-relatedpeptide (CGRP) pathway is an important therapeutic target forgastric mucosal injury (Luo et al., 2013). Rutaecarpine can stimulatethe TRPV1 receptor to release CGRP, inhibit the excessive secretionof gastric acid, and improve the symptoms of gastric ulcers (Liuet al., 2008). Moreover, Dehydroevodiamine can reduce theinflammatory injury of gastric mucosa by reducing the ERK/p38 signal pathway, down-regulating the expression ofmyeloperoxidase (MPO), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, upregulating theexpression of IL-10, regulating gastric pH and mucosal thickness(Wei et al., 2021). Then, dehydroevodiamine can also improveMNNG-induced gastric mucosal injury and GES-1 migration inchronic atrophic gastritis rats and treat atrophic gastritis byinhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1/vascular endothelialgrowth factor angiogenesis pathway (Wen et al., 2021).Furthermore, EF polysaccharides have a protective effect ongastric mucosa and can alleviate the symptoms of gastric ulcers.By increasing the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein, reducing theexpression of Keap1 protein, activating Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signalpathway, and reducing oxidative stress in the stomach (Luoet al., 2023).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.15090327.3 NeuroprotectionThe application of EF in neurological disorders is becomingincreasingly widespread. EF and its metabolites haveneuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases such asischemic injury, neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation,Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and so on. Studies have shown that EFmethanol extract (200 mg/kg) protects neurons and preventsischemia-induced cognitive impairment (Lee et al., 2011). Then,evodiamine can reduce peripheral hypersensitivity and anxiety innerve-injured mice (Zhang et al., 2020). Evodiamine can also repairmemory and cognitive impairment, protect neurons in vitro, andinhibit glial cell activation and neuroinflammation (Lima andHamerski, 2019). In the experimental AD mice induced byintracerebroventricular injection of streptomycin, evodiamine(50 and 100 mg/kg) was orally given daily for 21 days, the abilityto recognize new targets and the score of water maze test wasimproved in AD mice (Wang et al., 2018a). In addition, evodiaminecan improve AD mice\u2019s learning and cognitive impairment (Wanet al., 2024) and treat AD through antioxidation and anti-apoptosis(Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, rutaecarpine ameliorates neuronalinjury in rats with cerebral I/R by regulating the expression of ERK1/2 and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (Han et al., 2019). Rutaecarpine canaffect Ca2+ influx and activate PI3K/AKT signal pathway byactivating specific capsaicin receptor TRPV1, inhibit intracellularoxidative stress and apoptosis protease activity, and protect neuronsfrom apoptosis induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (Yang Y. et al.,2018). Additional research has shown that limonin and its variantsare versatile in combating neuroinflammation and neuronalapoptosis by activating PI3K/AKT and reducing TLR4/NF-\u03baBpathway activity and are effective in treating AD (Panda S. P.et al., 2024). Limonin plays a neuroprotective role by inhibitingneuronal autophagy andmicroglial activation in rats injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (Gao et al., 2023). Furthermore,dehydroevodiamine (10 mg/kg) can improve the symptoms ofmemory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice.Dehydroevodiamine has a strong protective effect on cognitiveimpairment through its antioxidant activity, inhibition ofneurotoxicity, and intracellular calcium. Therefore,Dehydroevodiamine may be an important drug for treatingmemory disorders (Shin et al., 2017). Tg2576-induced AD micewere treated with dehydroevodiamine (0.5 mg/kg) for 4 months,which improved the memory impairment of Tg mice and decreasedthe levels of soluble amyloid-\u03b2 40 (A\u03b240), soluble A\u03b242 and total A\u03b2peptide in the cortex of Tg mice. Dehydroevodiamine can inhibit theactivity of \u03b2-secretase in a dose-dependent manner, which is relatedto the production of A\u03b2 and the formation of neuritis plaques.Dehydroevodiamine may have a therapeutic effect on AD as a \u03b2-secretase inhibitor (Shin et al., 2016).7.4 Anti-inflammationThe anti-inflammatory activity of EF has been widelyrecognized. Research indicates that the 70% ethanol extract of EFcan inhibit the inflammatory response in HaCaT cells. It exerts itsanti-inflammatory effects by modulating the JAK-STAT and MAPKsignaling pathways. This regulation suppresses inflammatorymediators, cytokines, and chemokines, alleviating symptomsassociated with atopic dermatitis (Jin et al., 2024). EF has apotent anti-inflammatory and uric acid-lowering effect. The EFwater extract can significantly improve the production of seruminflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and inhibit the activationof renal NLRP3 inflammatory signal (Wang Z. et al., 2024). Inaddition, rutaecarpine can significantly reduce the inflammatoryresponse induced by pseudotype severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 by blocking the activity of 3C-like protease (Lin et al.,2023). It has been proved that rutaecarpine can inhibit inflammationby inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signal pathway mediated by PI3K/AKT andMAPK and reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell migrationand number by inhibiting Src/FAK pathway (Jayakumar et al.,2021). Rutaecarpine has also reduced inflammatory responses bydownregulating interferon-\u03b1, IL-23 p19, and IL-17A protein. Thisanti-inflammatory effect is mediated through the NF-\u03baB andTLR7 signaling pathways (Li Y. et al., 2019). Moreover,evodiamine is anti-inflammatory by inhibiting IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6,IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and other inflammatory factors mediated by NF-\u03baB(Zhang Y. et al., 2022). Evodiamine can also significantly reduce thepathological damage of breast tissue, inhibit the activation ofinflammation-related pathways such as AKT, NF-\u03baB p65, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, and significantly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Yang Y. et al., 2022). Evodiamine can alsoimprove ulcerative colitis by down-regulating NF-\u03baB signal pathwayand NLRP3 inflammatory bodies (Shen et al., 2019). Furthermore,limonin can reduce hepatic steatosis, lipid accumulation, and theexpression of p-STAT3/STAT3, caspase-8, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, and improve the inflammatoryresponse of non-alcoholic fatty liver (Wang W. et al., 2023).Limonin can effectively regulate the inflammation mediated byCD4+T cells and inhibit the proliferation of CD4+T cells byinhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 in activatedCD4+T cells (Kim W. et al., 2009). Limonin also participates inthe regulation of inflammatory pathways by effectively inhibitingp38 MAP. Limonin can also counteract hypertension and vasculardamage associated with metabolic syndrome by reducinginflammation and fibrosis (Hassan et al., 2018). Additionally,limonin significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 andinhibited the expression of inflammatory factors inlipopolysaccharide LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice (Wanget al., 2018b).7.5 AnalgesiaThe analgesic effect of EF is closely related to its anti-inflammatory effect. Oral 50% or 70% methanol extract of200 mg/kg EF has an analgesic effect on writhing induced byacetic acid (Matsuda et al., 1997). The analgesic effect of EF isrelated to its metabolites, including evodiamine, rutaecarpine,dehydroevodiamine, rutin, and limonin. Evodiamine exertsanalgesic effects through various mechanisms, such as inhibitingion channels, directly suppressing pain signals, reducing neuronalinflammation, restoring the balance between excitatory andinhibitory neurotransmission, and modulating neurotransmitterrelease (Jiang et al., 2022). In vitro, evodiamine can significantlyreduce capsaicin-induced current and thermal hyperalgesia in ratsFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032by activating TRPV1 and neuron desensitization (Iwaoka et al.,2016). Evodiamine can also inhibit migraine-like pain response,which may be due to the regulation of nNOS and the inhibition of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptorglutamate A1 (Lin et al., 2020). Evodiamine has been shown toinhibit neuropathic pain, improving paclitaxel-induced neuropathicpain by suppressing inflammatory responses and maintainingmitochondrial antioxidant function (Wu and Chen, 2019). Inaddition, limonin exhibits significant pain-relieving effects at30 or 100 mg/kg doses. This analgesic effect is likely associatedwith its anti-inflammatory properties (Matsuda et al., 1998).7.6 Anti-tumorEF exhibits potent anti-cancer properties and significant healingproperties against various cancers, including lung, liver, stomach,breast, and cervical. Studies have shown that 70% ethanol extract ofEF can significantly reduce the vitality of human cervical cancerHeLa cells at 20\u201360 \u03bcg/mL and show a certain concentrationcorrelation (Park et al., 2017). Evodiamine has anti-tumor effectsby inducing apoptosis, blocking the cell cycle, regulating autophagy,and inhibiting tumor cell metastasis (Luo et al., 2021; Panda et al.,2023). Evodiamine can treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bydown-regulating the expression of SOX-9 and \u03b2-catenin andsignificantly inhibiting cell migration by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Panda M. et al., 2024). Then,evodiamine can induce cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase,inhibit cell migration, and inhibit the Notch3 signal pathwayagainst NSCLC by inhibiting \u03b3-secretase (Yang X. et al., 2020).Evodiamine can increase the expression of cleaved-caspase-3,decrease the activity of TSGF and alpha-fetoprotein, induceAKT-mediated apoptosis, and exert an anti-hepatoma effect(Yang F. et al., 2017). Moreover, evodiamine inhibits PI3K/AKT,ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs and promotes apoptosis of ovarian cancercells by activating caspase-9/8/3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerasecleavage (Wei et al., 2016). Evodiamine activates retinoblastomaprotein through p53 and p21, which selectively inhibits breast cancerstem cells in the G1/S phase, resulting in cancer cell death (Han et al.,2016). Evodiamine inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosisof cholangiocarcinoma cells, inhibits the migration and invasion ofcholangiocarcinoma cells, suppresses IL-6/STAT3 signaltransduction by upregulating the expression of SHP-2, and treatscholangiocarcinoma (Zhu et al., 2019).Beyond that, rutaecarpine can inhibit CYP1A1 and exert ananti-tumor effect by inhibiting the binding of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin to its receptor (Rannug et al., 1992).Rutaecarpine can also significantly inhibit human CYP1A2 andCYP3A4 (Don et al., 2003; Iwata et al., 2005). Moreover, limonin caninhibit the cell activity of colorectal cancer cells, block STAT3 signaltransduction, and inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion, andcolony formation of colorectal cancer cells (ZhangW. F. et al., 2024).Limonin exhibits properties that combat breast cancer. It has beenreported that limonin has cytotoxicity on estrogen receptor-positiveor negative human breast cancer cells, which may inhibitproliferation by activating caspase-7 dependent pathway (Kimet al., 2013). What\u2019s more, dehydroevodiamine pancreatic is theactivator of DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) and hasthe ability to inhibit the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) pathway. It can effectively inhibit the proliferation ofpancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, and the growth ofprostate cancer stem cells in vitro and in vivo (Zhu et al., 2024).7.7 Glucose and lipid metabolism regulationEF can warm the stomach, invigorate the spleen, and be used inglucose and lipid metabolism. In fat metabolism, evodiaminereduced the food intake rate and weight gain rate of rats aftergrowth by downregulating the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY)and agouti-gene-related protein (AgRP) mRNA and peptideexpression in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Shi et al., 2009).Evodiamine, a new non-irritant vanillic acid receptor agonist, cansimultaneously induce heat loss and heat production, dissipate foodenergy, and prevent visceral fat accumulation and weight gain(Kobayashi et al., 2001). Then, evodiamine can also activateAMPK and adiponectin polymerization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,which is related to the activation of Ca2+-dependent PI3K/Akt/CaMKII signal pathway (Liu et al., 2014). Treatment withevodiamine over 13 weeks has been shown to lower serum totalcholesterol, low and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, andtriglycerides in obese rats on a high-fat diet, decrease bloodlipids, and mitigate obesity-related symptoms (Zhang et al.,2017). The combination of berberine and evodiamine can affectthe protein expression of PPAR\u03b3 and liver X receptor \u03b1 inhyperlipidemic rats and reduce the level of blood cholesterol inhyperlipidemic rats (Zhou et al., 2017b). Furthermore, evodiamineacts as a berberine promoter, and the mechanism of synergisticreduction of serum cholesterol in rats involves inhibiting theexpression of Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2),Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and apolipoprotein B-48(apoB-48) to reduce blood lipids (Zhou et al., 2017a). Moreover,ruteacarpine inhibited the expression of NPY and AgRP in thehypothalamic arcuate nucleus and the expression of these twoneuropeptides in N29-4 neuronal cells. This method effectivelylowers blood cholesterol, non-fasting glucose, insulin, and leptinand ameliorates obesity (Kim S. J. et al., 2009).On top of that, EF can also contribute to glucose metabolism andimprove the symptoms of diabetes. Studies have found that low-doseevodiamine can prevent increased body weight and improve glucosetolerance inmice. Enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK and reducedmTOR signal transduction, a regulator of energy metabolism, areobserved in white adipose tissue and are known to avert obesity andinsulin resistance (Yamashita et al., 2015). Evodiamide inhibitsinsulin-stimulated mTOR-S6K activation and IRS1 serinephosphorylation in adipocytes and improves glucose tolerance inobese/diabetes mice (Wang T. et al., 2013). Evodiamine andrutaecarpine can inhibit gluconeogenesis and adipogenesis byactivating constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in vitro and invivo and have therapeutic potential for the treatment ofhyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus type 2 (Yu et al., 2016).Rutaecarpine can regulate the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signal pathway inthe liver and AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 signal pathway inskeletal muscle to improve hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in fat-fed and streptozotocin-treated rats (Nie et al., 2016). Beyond that, EFpolysaccharides extracted by water solvent have strong antioxidantFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032activity and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition. It is a promising naturalantioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor.7.8 Protective effect of liver and kidneyEF canwarm the liver and kidney, protect the liver and kidney, and isclosely related to evodiamine, rutaecarpine, and limonin. In the liver,evodiamine can promote the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus,thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and oxidative stressin grass carp hepatocytes. It also downregulates the MAPK pathway,alleviating DEHP-induced apoptosis and restoring the expression ofantioxidant genes. By blocking the Nrf2/MAPK pathway, evodiamineinhibits DEHP-induced apoptosis in grass carp hepatocytes (Lei et al.,2023; Xiong et al., 2022). Evodiamine (15 and 25 mg/kg) has an anti-fibrotic effect on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis and reduces theproliferation and collagen metabolism of hepatic stellate cells in vitroby down-regulating the relative expressions of TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2/3, and\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (Yang D. et al., 2018). Additionally, rutaecarpineupregulates antioxidant enzymes through CaMKII-Akt and Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathways, enhances theexpression of HO-1 in hepatocytes, and has a protective effect onhepatotoxicity induced by TBHP (Jin et al., 2017). Rutaecarpineprotects mice from acute acetaminophen-induced liver injury byactivating antioxidant enzymes. It could significantly reduce theactivity of serum ALT/AST and MDA induced by acetaminophenand prevent liver GSH depletion induced by acetaminophen (Choiet al., 2021). Moreover, limonins have a furan ring structure and areeasily activated to form RMs, which are crucial in induced hepatotoxicity(Liu Y. et al., 2020). CYP3A4 inducer aggravated the hepatotoxicityinduced by large flower germ, while limonin reduced its hepatotoxicity(Zhang et al., 2021c). Limonin can also diminish the liver toxicity causedby acetaminophen by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant signal andsuppressing NF-\u03baB inflammation by increasing SIRT1 levels. Limoninshows potential as a treatment for liver damage caused by acetaminophen(Yang R. et al., 2020).In renal metabolism, I/R injury can lead to acute kidney failure.Owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptoticproperties, evodiamine can reduce the biochemical and pathologicaltissue of renal I/R injury in rats (Eraslan et al., 2019). Studies have shownthat evodiamine can also protect against LPS-induced acute renal injuryand cytotoxicity by regulating ROS NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation (Shiet al., 2019). What is more, rutaecarpine can prevent and treat renal I/Rinjury by inhibiting JNK/p38MAPK signal pathway and interfering withoxidative stress (Wang et al., 2017). Moreover, limonin, acting as anatural ERK2 agonist, plays a role in averting ischemic acute renaldamage, primarily through the activation of the ERK signal pathway,which aids in the growth of renal tubular cells and diminishes apoptosisfollowing acute kidney injury (AKI) (Zhou et al., 2023). Limoninregulates arachidonic acid metabolism by inhibiting CYP3A4 activity,thus improving cisplatin-induced acute renal injury and ultimatelyprotecting renal function (Zeng et al., 2023).7.9 Insecticidal and antibacterialAncient records indicate that EF possesses insecticidalproperties. The extracts and metabolites of EF showed specificinsecticidal properties. Findings indicated superior dewormingeffects of ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, and methanol extract onGoldfish-Gyrodactylus kobayashii in living organisms, with EF ethylacetate extract emerging as the most efficient and secure (Lian et al.,2019). Subsequently, EF volatile oil exhibits insect-killing propertiesagainst maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais, and red flour beetleTribolium castaneum, showing LC50 values of 36.89, 24.57, and57.31 mg/L air, in that order (Liu and Du, 2011). In addition,evodiamine and rutaecarpine have insecticidal activity against larvaeof Drosophila melanogaster with LC50 values of 0.30 and 0.28 \u03bcmol/mL diet, respectively, among which rutaecarpine has the strongestactivity (Miyazawa et al., 2002). Evodiamine and rutaecarpine hadstrong insecticidal activity against the fourth instar larvae of Aedesalbopictus with LC50 values of 12.51 and 17.02 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.EF ethanol extract, limonin, and evodiol also had insecticidal activityagainst Asian tiger mosquitoes, and the LC50 values were 43.21,32.43, and 52.22 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Liu et al., 2012). Moreover, thenematicidal activity of evodiamine and rutaecarpine againstMeloidogyne incognita was stronger than the crude EF ethanolextract, and the LC50 values were 73.55, 120.85, and 131.54 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Both evodiol and limonin demonstrated theirability to kill Meloidogyne incognita, evidenced by LC50 values of155.02 and 197.37 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, yet they were less potent thanthe raw EF ethanol extract (Liu et al., 2013). Other studies found thatlimonin had effective biological activity against larvae and adults ofSchistosoma mansoni, and its antiparasite activity was enhanced in adose-dependent manner (Eraky et al., 2016).EF\u2019s long-term use in treating diarrhea and beriberi is due to itsantibacterial and antifungal properties. The EF volatile oil has thestrongest activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus,the maximum inhibitory zone diameter is 17.9 and 12.2 mm,respectively, and the MIC is 3.2\u20136.4 mg/mL (Liu S. S. et al.,2019). Furthermore, three novel quinazoline alkaloids, specificallyevodiamine A, evodiamine B, and evodiamine C, were extractedfrom EF methanol. They prohibited excellent inhibition againstXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola,and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, with respective EC50values of 3.13, 14.32, and 32.72 nmol (Su et al., 2018). Moreover,evodiamine can enhance the activation of NLRP-3 inflammatorybodies by inducing acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin lysine 40 residues, thusenhancing innate immunity to bacterial infection (Li C. G.et al., 2019).7.10 Anti-osteoporosisRutaecarpine, evodiamine, and limonin demonstratedobvious anti-osteoporotic effects. Rutaecarpine significantlyinhibits osteoclast production and bone resorption of bonemarrow-derived macrophages osteoclasts by reducing theprotein level of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc-1) and phosphorylation of other signal pathways duringosteoclast differentiation (Fukuma et al., 2018). In addition,evodiamine has been reported to inhibit osteoclast formationby blocking receptor activators for NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced ERK and c-Fos activation and NFATc-1 induction ina dose and time-dependent manner (Jiang et al., 2017).Evodiamine can inhibit osteoclast formation induced byFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032RANKL through NF-\u03baB and calcium signaling pathways andreduce bone loss in ovariectomy and ovariectomized mice byinhibiting osteoclast production (Jin et al., 2019). Subsequently,evodiamine is capable of mitigating osteoporosis in zebrafishcaused by dexamethasone, by counteracting the disproportion inbone development and resorption and triggering the matrixmetalloproteinase 3-osteopontin-MAPK pathway signal (Yinet al., 2019). Beyond that, limonin can increase the calciumconcentration of the femur and fifth lumbar vertebra inovariectomized rats, and the mechanism may be related topromoting bone formation (Mandadi et al., 2009). Researchhas found that the loss of ovarian function can lead to a lackof ovarian-related hormones, resulting in rapid loss of ovarian-related bones (Renno et al., 2006). Limonin can efficientlyprevent bone mass reduction and enhance bone mineraldensity in rats post-ovariectomy. Moreover, limonin stimulatesthe activity of ALP in osteoblast MC3T3-E1 and enhances theexpression of osteoblast differentiation gene markers byregulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and P38 signal(Lee et al., 2016).7.11 Other activityEF not only offers attractive pharmacological effects but alsoprovides antiallergic, antioxidant, antidepressant, and protection forthe prostate, among others.7.11.1 AntiallergicIn vitro and in vivo, evodiamine and rutaecarpine may inhibitthe biosynthesis of allergy-related cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4) inmast cells and basophils, suggesting that they may be effectiveagainst IgE-induced allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitisand rhinitis (Shin et al., 2007). Subsequently, limonin effectivelymanages allergies induced by IgE. This substance can significantlyreduce IgE production in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) and B cell lines of children allergic to food, potentiallyowing to the suppression of \u03b5-germ line transcript expression inPBMC (Yang et al., 2014).7.11.2 AntioxidantIn natural aging rats, limonin decreased the levels of MDA andlipofuscin in serum and brain tissue, increased the activities ofsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and GSH-Px in serum and braintissue, and enhanced the total antioxidant capacity in brain tissue(Li et al., 2016). Notably, when altered by the structure of limonin,limonin glycosides can attain antioxidant properties by neutralizingfree radicals (Poulose et al., 2005). However, some researchersquestion whether limonin has antioxidant activity (Breksa andManners, 2006). There is a lack of research on the antioxidantmechanism of limonin, and this natural antioxidant is worthy offurther exploration.7.11.3 AntidepressantThe antidepressant effect of evodiamine on chronic,unpredictable stress rats may be achieved by regulatingmonoamine transmitters and BDNF-TrkB signal transduction inthe hippocampus (Jiang et al., 2015).7.11.4 Prostate protectionThe EF ethanol extract has a strong 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitoryactivity. The treatment of EF ethanol extract in benign prostatichyperplasia-1 cells inhibits cell viability through caspase-8 andcystatin-3-dependent apoptosis and effectively inhibits the growthof benign prostatic hyperplasia-1 cells (Park et al., 2018). In addition,EF volatile oil has obvious anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits thegrowth of prostate cancer-3 cells by directly and indirectly regulatingthe cytokine secretion profile of spleen cells (Yeh and Lin, 2021). Notonly this, evodiamine can also inhibit prostate hyperplasia andmigration through the PI3K/AKT/NF\u03baB signal pathway,indicating that it may be a potential lead drug in the treatmentof prostate cancer (Lei et al., 2022).8 ToxicityAncient TCM texts have chronicled EF\u2019s mild toxic effects,potentially causing eye harm, hair fall, and gastrointestinal issuesif misused. In recent years, many studies have shown that overuse ofEF can cause toxic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominalpain, diarrhea, and blurred vision (Ma et al., 2018) and cause liverand kidney toxicity to the human body (Teschke, 2014). EF and itsmetabolites have been reported to cause liver damage at high dosesand induce arrhythmias, leading to cardiotoxicity (Teschke et al.,2014). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that EF hashepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. However, thereare few studies on the cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of EF. Thetoxicity of EF is summarized as follows (Table 5).8.1 HepatotoxicityEF causes hepatocyte cytotoxicity, attributed to oxidative stress,mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, livermetabolic disorder, and apoptosis (Cai et al., 2014). Thetoxicological mechanisms are peroxidation, inflammatory factors,mitochondrial damage, and the formation of drug-protein adducts.Research revealed that various EF extracts might lead to sudden liverdamage, with volatile oil exhibiting the highest level ofhepatotoxicity, succeeded by total extract and ethanol extract,and water extract showing minimal hepatotoxicity.8.1.1 Oxidative damageEF may cause oxidative harm by impacting vital elements of thebody\u2019s oxidation-antioxidant mechanism. Studies have shown thatEF aqueous extraction can cause liver injury in mice aftercontinuous intragastric administration for 21 days. It was foundthat the content of MDA in liver tissue increased, the ratio of SOD/MDA and the activity of GSH-Px decreased significantly, and thepathomorphology showed focal hepatocyte necrosis (Zhou L. et al.,2013). The hepatotoxicity of EF is related to the oxidative stress inthe liver and has a certain dose-effect relationship. Following 15 daysof orally administering EF via aqueous extraction, there was anotable reduction in SOD activity in the mice\u2019s liver tissues, withSOD levels rising in each dosage group as the dose was increased(Cai et al., 2014). In addition, liver injury occurred after continuousintragastric administration of EF volatile oil for 7 days, resulting inFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032TABLE 5 Toxicity of EF and its metabolites.Toxicology ToxicitymechanismsChemicalcompoundsType ofstudyExperimentalsubjectDose range Duration Toxic manifestations ReferencesHepatotoxicity Oxidative damage andinflammatory responseEF aqueous extract In vivo KM mice 10, 20, 30 g/kg 21 days (\u2212): The level of SOD/MDA, GSH-Px and NOS.(+): The level of ALT, AST, GSH, MDA, IL-1\u03b2,IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1Zhou et al.(2013a)Oxidative damage andinflammatory responseEF aqueous extract In vivo Male SD rats 6, 12, 24 g/kg 15 days (\u2212): The level of MnSOD, GSH, ATP, andmitochondrial potential(+): The level of MDA.Cai et al.

Research indicates that the presence of 3-alkylindoles inevodiamine and rutaecarpine leads to the creation of highlyelectrophilic intermediates, namely iminoquinone and 3-methyleneindolenine, via P450-driven oxidation in livermicrosomes (primarily driven by CYP3A4 and to a smallerdegree by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6), causing harmful effects onhepatocytes when GSH is depleted (Wen et al., 2014).8.1.2 Inflammatory responseInflammatory injury is one of the causes of liver injury causedby EF. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are inflammatory transmittersclosely related to inflammatory response. These inflammatorytransmitters can further amplify the signal of inflammatoryresponse and promote apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes.Findings indicate that mice experienced liver damage andelevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in their liver tissue 15 daysfollowing the EF aqueous extraction (Liu et al., 2018). Aftercontinuous intragastric administration of EF aqueousextraction for 21 days, the high, middle, and low dose groupsof EF could significantly increase the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2,and IL-6 in liver tissue of mice, with a certain dose-effectrelationship (Zhou L. et al., 2013). After continuousintragastric administration of EF aqueous and ethanolextraction for 15 days, the expression of phosphorylatedERK1/2 in the liver of mice was significantly upregulated.Activation of ERK1/2 can induce cells to produce TNF-\u03b1,which mediates inflammatory response and apoptosis-relatedtranscriptional regulatory factors (Liao et al., 2014). Duringmetabolic processes, the P450 enzyme activates evodiamine inEF aqueous extraction, resulting in liver damage andinflammation, primarily due to elevated levels of ALT, AST,ALP, LDH, MPO, MDA, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1 (Ren et al., 2024).8.1.3 Mitochondrial damageMitochondria are the main sites of cell biological oxidation,which mainly synthesize ATP. Mitochondria are essential targets ofdrug toxicity in drug-induced liver injury. Studies have shown thatintragastric administration of EF aqueous extracts of 6, 12, and24 g/kg for 15 days can cause hepatocyte mitochondrial swelling andvacuolation, and eventually lead to apoptosis due to ATP depletionand cytochrome C release (Cai et al., 2014). Moreover, both ethanoland aqueous extracts of EF have hepatotoxicity, and the cytotoxicityof EF ethanol extract is stronger. In addition, evodiamine has thestrongest toxicity among the extracts of EF, which can significantlyreduce the number of cells and increase the mitochondrialmembrane potential (MMP) in vitro (Yang et al., 2024b).Evodiamine (0.04\u201325 \u03bcmol/L) decreased the survival rate ofHepG2 cells, increased MMP, and induced apoptosis in a time-and dose-dependent manner (Gao et al., 2021). Mitochondrialpermeability transition plays an important role in mediatinghepatocyte injury (Labbe et al., 2008; Pessayre et al., 2010).Limonin has hepatotoxicity, which can cause oxidative damage torat mitochondria, lead to mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrialpermeability transition pore opening, mitochondrial potentialdecrease, and finally trigger cell death signal pathway (Fanet al., 2019).8.1.4 Formation of drug-protein adductsThe alkaloids easily combine with proteins to form drug-proteinadducts. Drug-protein adducts may cause toxicity by damaging thephysiological function of the modified protein or through animmune-mediated mechanism (Zhou et al., 2005). The role ofRMs is significant in liver damage caused by drugs. Thesecondary amine configuration of Rutaecarpine enables itsactivation into RMs via the CYPs enzyme, leading to a covalentbond with CYPs and proteins in rat liver cells, resulting in drug-protein complexes and subsequent liver damage (Zhang et al., 2015).RMs can consume GSH, leading to excessive ROS production,respiratory chain dysfunction, cell stress, mitochondrial damage,cell membrane damage, and hepatocyte damage (Akbulut et al.,2014). CYPs are the primary enzymes involved in drug metabolismwithin the human body. Certain medications transform into RMsvia the biological actions of CYPs (Yan et al., 2023). It has beenfound that rutaecarpine can inhibit many types of CYP activity, suchas CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 (Zhang et al., 2015).The induction of cytochrome P450 enzyme gene, liver transportprotein, and phase 2 enzyme gene are involved in the interactionbetween evodiamine and drugs (Zhu et al., 2013). Evodiamine andrutaecarpine can cause toxicity through P450-mediateddehydrogenation, produce highly electrophilic intermediates, andlead to drug-drug interaction mainly through the inactivation ofCYP3A4 (Wen et al., 2014). In addition, evodiamine can inhibitCYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 in rats (Zhang et al., 2016).Evodiamine is easily oxidized to an epoxy structure that binds toGSH. When GSH is depleted, some liver damage will occur (Zhanget al., 2015).8.2 CardiotoxicityThe cardiotoxicity of EF is mainly caused by oxidative damageand inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG)channels in the heart. Its primary connections are in alkaloidswith evodiamine, rutaecarpine, dehydroevodiamine, andhydroxyrutaecarpine.8.2.1 Oxidative damageThe heart is the most oxygen-consuming organ, and many basicstudies have confirmed the cardiotoxicity mediated by oxidativestress (Shen et al., 2024). Oxidative damage is closely related toevodiamine and rutaecarpine. Studies have shown that evodiamineat the concentration of 31.3\u2013250 \u03bcg/mL for 24 h can significantlyreduce the level of MDA and the activity of superoxide dismutase,resulting in oxidative stress injury of cardiomyocytes. Subsequently,evodiamine could induce oxidative stress by generating free radicals,potentially harming the architecture and functionality ofcardiomyocytes. After being treated with 28.44 \u03bcg/mLevodiamine for 24 h, cardiomyocytes reached 50% inhibitoryconcentration, which significantly decreased the activity of SODin rat cardiomyocytes. In the zebrafish model, the mortality rate ofzebrafish treated with 354 ng/mL evodiamine was 10%, causingcardiac dysfunction and pericardial malformations (Yang W. et al.,2017). The findings imply that evodiamine could lead to heart-related side effects, including oxidative stress. Determining LDH andcreatine kinase (CK) activity is one of the biochemical indexes forFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org17Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032evaluating and diagnosing heart disease. The level of LDH in serumreflects the injury of myocardial cell permeability. The activity levelof CK is directly related to the consumption and supply ofmyocardial oxygen and energy, muscle contraction, andmitochondrial function (Zervou et al., 2016; Bak and Schousboe,2017; Klein et al., 2020). Evodiamine and rutaecarpine have toxiceffects on rat cardiomyocytes H9c2 and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes(NRCMs), mainly by reducing the protein expression of cyclicguanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G pathway inH9c2 cells and changing the spontaneous beating frequency inNRCMs (Zhang D. et al., 2022). What is more, a high dose ofevodiamine will lead to severe morphological abnormalities of theliver, pericardial edema, and increased myocardial concentration.8.2.2 Inhibition of cardiac hERG channelThe hERG channel is the ion channel on the myocardial cellmembrane, which is very important to maintain the normalelectrophysiological activity of the heart. Abnormal opening orclosing of the hERG channel will lead to arrhythmia (Liao et al.,2024). In vitro, rutaecarpine can reduce the threonine/tyrosinephosphorylation of Sp1 and the expression of the hERG channelthrough the PI3K/AKT pathway in HEK 293 cells. Subsequently,administering rutaecarpine for 2 weeks may extend the QT/QTcinterval intervals and enhance the rate of ventricular fibrillationinduction in the hearts of guinea pigs (Zhan et al., 2021). In addition,dehydroevodiamine can inhibit the hERG channel, change themyocardial excitation process, and lead to arrhythmia and evenventricular fibrillation in severe cases (Zhang et al., 2023).Depending on the dose, dehydroevodiamine, and hortiamine canprolong action potential duration and early afterdepolarizations ofcardiomyocytes, eventually leading to arrhythmias (Baburin et al.,2018). There are also studies indicating that hydroxyrutaecarpineinhibits hERG current by binding to F656 and Y652 sites in thehERG channel. It can shorten the inactivation time constant,accelerate the process of channel inactivation, and inhibit thefunction of the hERG channel (Li X. H. et al., 2022).8.3 NephrotoxicityEF\u2019s nephrotoxic effects primarily stem from renal cell death andoxidative stress. Its similarity to evodiamine and limonin in EF isnotable. Mice were administered the EF ethanol extract in groups oflow, medium, and high dosages. In the group receiving a highdosage, there was a noticeable flexing of the glomerular Mesangiumand an enlargement of both glomerular podocytes and endothelialcells (Liu et al., 2015). In vivo experiments showed that evodiaminecould induce renal cell death and regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTORpathway by inducing intracellular calcium overload (Yang et al.,2024a). Rutaecarpine can significantly reduce the level of cortisoland regulate glucocorticoid metabolism. Renal injury may be relatedto the induction of apoptosis-related protein Bax andBcl2 expression (Yang C. Q. et al., 2022). Evodiamine andevodiolide in alkaloids can damage mitochondria, lead tomitochondrial dysfunction, produce a large number of freeradicals from mitochondria, further aggravate oxidative stress,induce apoptosis, and promote renal damage (Zhou Q.j. et al.,2013). In addition, limonin also has a certain toxicity to kidneycells. Comprehensive analysis of animal experiments andchromatographic analysis showed that hydroxyl or acetoxylimonoid derivatives and coumarin in EF may be the leadingcauses of toxicity (Shan et al., 2021). Studies have shown thatlimonin (50\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL) can significantly inhibit the viability ofHEK 293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A concentrationranging from 100\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL may lead to atrophy, reduction, oreven fatality of renal cells (Fan et al., 2019).9 Monitoring and prevention of toxicityof EF9.1 Surveillance and prevention ofhepatotoxicityThe typical oral dose of EF is 2\u20135 g, taken by water decoction or pillpowder. It is generally non-toxic within a reasonable dose range, but itneeds to be monitored if it is overused. The liver function test,coagulation function test, serum bilirubin level test, liver ultrasound,and liver biopsy can monitor the hepatotoxicity of EF. Liver functiontests can detect transaminase, bilirubin, alkaline thrombin,cholinesterase, and other indexes in blood and evaluate thefunctional status of the liver (Shiihara et al., 2024). Coagulationfunction tests can determine prothrombin time, thrombin time, andactivated thrombin time and help to judge whether the liver is abnormal(Kumagai et al., 2023). A high serum bilirubin level may indicate liverinjury or biliary obstruction disease (Poynard et al., 2023). Liverultrasound can observe liver structural abnormalities or steatosis(Vardar et al., 2022). Liver biopsies help to confirm whether there ishepatocyte injury or inflammation (Palmer et al., 2024). Therefore,patients using EF should regularly check their liver function and bloodcoagulation function, pay close attention to the indexes of transaminase,bilirubin, alkaline thrombin, and cholinesterase, and adjust the dosageof EF in time to avoid drug-induced liver injury.9.2 Surveillance and prevention ofcardiotoxicityThe cardiotoxicity of EF can be evaluated by physicalmonitoring and measurement of specific biomarkers, includingelectrocardiogram changes, blood electrolyte levels, andmyocardial enzyme activity (Qiu et al., 2023). Anelectrocardiogram is a direct indicator of the heart\u2019selectrophysiological function, and irregular waveforms couldsignal the presence of an arrhythmia (Henriksen et al., 2023).Disproportionate levels of electrolytes in the blood, particularlyirregular potassium ion concentrations, frequently lead toarrhythmias (Sauer and Porter, 2021). Increased myocardialenzyme activity, such as creatine kinase and lactatedehydrogenase, may damage heart tissue (Gai et al., 2021).Therefore, patients using EF should have regular ambulatoryelectrocardiogram monitoring. The global cardiac activity wasmeasured for 24 h, and the heart rate variability and myocardialperfusion indexes were observed. It assists patients in adjusting theirmedication dosage promptly to reduce the occurrence ofcardiotoxicity.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org18Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.15090329.3 Surveillance and prevention ofnephrotoxicityThe nephrotoxicity of EF can be monitored by urinalysis, renalfunction tests, biochemical assays, and renal biopsy (Canki et al.,2024). Urine tests can reflect proteinuria, hematuria,hemoglobinuria, cylindruria, urinary calcium, and alkaline urine(Wu and Fenton, 2018). Renal function tests assess the endogenouscreatinine clearance rate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uricacid levels and evaluate the glomerular filtration rate through aradionuclide renogram (Nieto et al., 2020). Biochemical tests canmonitor serum liver and renal function-related enzyme levels(Sumer et al., 2020). A renal biopsy is capable of directlymonitoring the pathological alterations in kidney tissue, includingthe deterioration of tubular epithelial cells, necrosis, congestion inthe interstitial space, swelling, infiltration of inflammatory cells,fibrosis in the renal interstitial area, and the expansion or shrinkageof the renal tubules (Xu et al., 2024). Therefore, patients taking EFshould have regular urinalysis and blood tests and pay attention tothe levels of urinary protein, red blood cells, serum creatinine, andurea nitrogen to ensure timely detection of issues andimplementation of appropriate treatment measures, therebyreducing the incidence of renal toxicity. Concurrently, it iscrucial to rigorously regulate the dosage while administering EFto prevent excessive use. Regular monitoring of kidney functionduring usage is crucial for early identification of kidney toxicity.10 Conclusion and prospectEF ranks among the most prevalent and extensively utilizedTCM, with a history of use in China spanning millennia. The latestresearch achievements of EF in standardized cultivation, traditionalapplication, processing methods, quality control, phytochemistry,pharmacology, and toxicology were reviewed in this paper. EF hascardiovascular protection, anti-inflammation, analgesia,gastrointestinal protection, anti-tumor, neuroprotection, glucoseand lipid metabolism regulation, and other pharmacologicaleffects. Frequently, it serves as a treatment for abdominaldiscomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, high blood pressure,eczema, and oral ulcers. Despite EF\u2019s diverse pharmacologicaleffects, ancient texts document its mild toxicity. The harmfuleffects of TCM have persistently been a worry in both its clinicalusage and formulation. Therefore, it is suggested that the followingareas should be considered in future research.From a botanical perspective, it is evident that ER, ERO, andERB are the trio of EF sources, with nearly mature fruits primarilycategorized into LEF, MEF, and SEF. MEF produced in Jiangxi is agenuine medicinal material mainly distributed in Sichuan, Guizhou,and other places south of the QinlingMountains in China. However,most current studies only distinguish the varieties of Euodiarutaecarpa, and few studies have demonstrated the effect of EFsize on pharmacological action. From a conventional standpoint,EF\u2019s initial documentation appears in Shen Nong\u2019s Herbal Classic,known for its customary properties of alleviating cold and pain,diminishing nausea and vomiting, enhancing yang, and haltingdiarrhea. Currently, numerous clinical prescriptions andformulations have been developed, primarily using EF, fortreating conditions like abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic non-atrophic gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, primarydysmenorrhea, and more. However, the specific mechanism isnot completely clear, and the clinical application of EF needsmore extensive verification. Moreover, modern pharmacologicalstudies mainly focus on EF or its metabolites, seriously ignoringthe effects caused by drug interaction. According to the traditionalapplication, exploring the synergistic effect of drugs to improveclinical efficacy and safety is of great significance. In terms ofprocessing methods, ancient classical works have recorded theprocessing of EF with licorice, salt, ginger, vinegar, and othermethods, which can increase efficiency and reduce toxicity.Modern research has proved that the best result can be obtainedwhen the ratio of EF to licorice is 100: 6. However, few articlescurrently study this aspect. The metabolites of EF were widelystudied. About 300 metabolites were isolated and identified fromthe plant, including alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, volatile oils,and others. Indole alkaloids, especially evodiamine, andrutaecarpine, have been studied for many years. However,studying terpenoids, flavonoids, and volatile oils in EF is notdeep enough, which seriously limits people\u2019s understanding ofthe pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms. Therefore,further study of other metabolites is a priority for the future. Thequality assurance of EF is closely related to evodiamine,rutaecarpine, and limonin. It is stipulated that the content ofevodiamine and rutaecarpine is not less than 0.15%, and thecontent of limonin is not less than 0.20%. However, there is nomaximum limit for using these three ingredients. According tomodern research, the content of rutaecarpine and limonin shouldnot exceed 100 mg/kg/d, and the content of evodiamine should notexceed 300 mg/kg/d. Although researchers have done a lot ofresearch on the minimum and maximum dose, a unifiedstandard has not been formed, so it is necessary to conduct anin-depth study.The research on toxicology and its mechanisms of EF in vivo andin vitro is insufficient, limiting its more extensive application.Contemporary studies extensively focus on EF\u2019s hepatotoxiceffects, with lesser emphasis on cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicityand a lack of comprehensive and clear understanding of the toxicityof EF. After analyzing the metabolites of EF, it is concluded thatevodiamine, rutaecarpine, limonin, and dehydroevodiamine arerelated to cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In a specific range,the toxicity of EF to the heart and kidney is proportional to the dose,and long-term overuse will aggravate the toxicity. Attention must bepaid to the dosage of EF in clinical application. The research on drugdosage is also very scarce, and the dosage of 2\u20135 g stipulated in ChPis not exactly the same as the actual clinical dose. Therefore, theresearch on the dose of EF should be further strengthened. In vitroand vivo experiments showed that EF may be toxic to the liverthrough peroxidation injury, inflammatory response factormediation, mitochondrial damage, and the formation of drug-protein adducts. EF may cause cardiotoxicity through oxidativedamage and inhibition of hERG channels in the heart. EF couldreact to kidney toxicity by inducing apoptosis and oxidative stress.However, EF\u2019s specific toxic risks and potential disadvantages mustbe further studied, especially cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Theexisting studies mainly focus on the preliminary stage of animalexperiments and clinical trials. The specific application effect of EFFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org19Hao et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1509032in different diseases needs to be further verified, and its safety needsto be evaluated more comprehensively. Therefore, the clinical use ofEF should be closely monitored to ensure its safety.TCM stands as a repository of abundant resources anddistinctive processing techniques. However, the phytochemistry,pharmacology, and toxicology of TCM are complex. Therefore,we should further strengthen the research on thepharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of EF, furtherexpand and optimize its application in medicine, and better meetthe clinical needs. EF is a valuable plant medicine with various uses,pharmacological activities, and reliable clinical efficacy. It hassignificant medicinal value and potential to develop newtherapeutic drugs. Therefore, systematic and comprehensiveresearch on its metabolism and pharmacological andtoxicological mechanisms is a hot spot.Author contributionsYH: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal Analysis,Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing\u2013original draft,Writing\u2013review and editing.
