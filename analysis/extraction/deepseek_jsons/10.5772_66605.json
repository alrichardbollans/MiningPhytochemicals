Rosmarinus officinalisImad Hadi Hameed and Ghaidaa Jihadi MohammedAdditional information is available at the end of the chapterAbstractRosemary is a well-known aromatic and medicinal plant whose consumption serves to remedy the number of disorders. Its essential oil (EO) constitutes an important ingredient for well-being feeling improvement through beauty products such as soaps, perfumes, and deodorants. The identification of phytochemical compounds is based on the peak area, retention time molecular weight, molecular formula, chemical structure, and phar-macological actions. It contains chemical constitutions, which may be useful for various herbal formulations as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, cardiac tonic, and anti-asthmatic. Therefore, this chapter reviews the phytochemical compounds of Rosmarinus officinalis, using methanolic extraction. The phytochemical compound is screened by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method and the evaluation of antimicro-bial and antioxidant activities of the essential oils.Keywords: aromatic and medicinal plant, Rosmarinus officinalis, gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis, essential oil, antibacterial activity, antioxidant activity1. IntroductionRosmarinus officinalis thrives well in dry and arid regions, hills and low mountains, calcareous, shale, clay, and rocky substrates. Its use since ancient times in traditional medicine is justified by its antiseptic [1, 2], antirheumatic [3], anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic [4, 5], antimicrobial, and anti-hepatotoxic properties [6]. Its appreciation as a spice for seasoning and food preservation [7] is supported by a very high antioxidant activity [8]. The potent antioxidant properties of rosemary extracts have been attributed to its phenolic compounds, mainly rosmarinic acid and diterpenes carnosic acid and carnosol [9, 10]. Rosemary extract relaxes smooth muscles and has choleretic, \u00a9 2017 The Author(s). Licensee InTech.

Recent research shows that rosemary extracts possess strong anticancer properties. In the last few years, gas chromatography-mass spectrom-etry (GC-MS) has become firmly established as a key technological platform for metabolite profil-ing in plant [12\u201316]. GC-MS-based metabolome analysis has profound applications in discovering the mode of action of drugs or herbicides and helps unravel the effect of altered gene expression on metabolism and organism performance in biotechnological applications.2. HistoryRosemary has been named the Herb of the Year in 2001 by the International Herb Association. Hippocrates, Galen, and dioscorides prescribed rosemary for liver problems. Rosemary is not a popular plant in India. It was introduced by the Europeans as a garden plant due to its pleasant fragrant-scented leaves.3. VarietiesThere are more than 20 varieties of rosemary plant. The different types of rosemary are as follows:1. Upright rosemary: It measures between six and eight feet in diameter and two feet or more in height.2. Creeping rosemary: It covers eight or 10 feet in diameter in a very short period of time. It can also trail down eight or 10 feet. It falls all the way to the ground and is covered with pale blue flowers.3. Pine-scented rosemary: Pine-scented rosemary is a soft sea green that grows to about three to four feet high by about four or more feet wide.4. Arp rosemary: This plant grows where winter temperatures are frequently in the teens or less.5. Madalene hill rosemary: It is a cold hardy rosemary. It is rated to survive \u221215\u00b0 and is erect, growing to about three feet. Its flowers are light blue.6. Pink rosemary: It has the thinnest leaves of all R. officinalis plants. The flower is pale in color and grows quickly to two feet.7. Dancing waters rosemary: It is shorter, more mounding and has dark blue flowers.8. Golden rain rosemary: It has weeping foliage. The golden hue of the plant turns darker green over summer and returns with cooler weather.9. Blue boy rosemary: It is the smallest of all the rosemary varieties. It has small leaves and little light blue pearls for flowers. This plant grows out to cover about 12 inches but rarely gets over six inches tall.4.

Phytochemical compounds identified in methanolic extract of Rosmarinus officinalisAromatic and Medicinal Plants - Back to Nature1805. Major chemical constituents of R. officinalis using gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysisThe GC-MS analysis of the plant extract was made in a (QP 2010 Plus SHIMADZU) instru-ment under computer control at 70 eV [18\u201336].Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis of compounds was carried out in meth-anolic seed extract of R. officinalis, shown in Table 1. Among the identified phytocompounds have the property of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Plant-based antimicrobials have enormous therapeutic potential as they can serve the purpose with lesser side effects [37\u201341]. In addition, rosemary harvested in Portugal is rich in myrcene (25%), 1,8-cineole, and cam-phor [42] while rosemary from North East of Spain presents an essential oil (EO) containing camphor and \u03b1-pinene as main constituents [43]. Furthermore, the essential oil of Lebanese rosemary is characterized by 1,8-cineole (20%) and \u03b1-pinene (18.8\u201338.5%) [44]. The major compounds of R. officinalis\u2019 essential oil from Eastern Cape Province in South Africa are ver-benone (17.43%), camphor (16.57%), 1,8-cineole (11.91%), \u03b1-pinene (11.47%), borneol (5.74%), and camphene (5.70%) [45]. Many factors affect yield and chemical composition of essential oils such as drying, harvest period, harvest region, extraction technique, and the age of the plant [46, 47].6. Antioxidant activityAntioxidant activity of R. officinalis is due to its phenolic compounds including carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmarinic acid, and hydroxycinnamic acid ester. Rosemary uptake improves memory, and it is sometimes used as an antidepressant. It is also useful against cough and digestive disorders such as diarrhea, spasms, and flatulence. Thanks to diuretic and anti-spasmodics properties, the aerial parts of rosemary are orally used to relieve renal colic and dysmenorrhea [48\u201352].7. Antibacterial activityR. officinalis and R. eriocalyx EOs are extremely active on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. This result is very important especially for P. aeruginosa, which is known for its high resistance to all antibiotics. These results have some similarities with those of Taoufik Ouassil since he found that R. officinalis is active against the four species of bacteria (Escherichia coli: <14 mm, Staphylococcus aureus: <14 mm, P. aeruginosa: 14 mm, K. pneumoniae: 14 mm). Diameters of inhibition concerning E. coli and S. aureus are similar to ours but a great difference can be observed concerning P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. Many research-ers have highlighted sensitivity of Gram (+) bacteria compared to Gram (\u2212) while testing natu-ral extract but in our case it seems that Rosmarinus\u2019 essential oils are more active against Gram (\u2212) bacteria. R. officinalis essential oil expressed a strong inhibitory activity against K. pneumoniae with an MIC of 2.08 mg/ml, and S. aureus with an MIC of 8.35 mg/ml. E. coli and Phytochemistry, Antioxidant, Antibacterial Activity, and Medicinal Uses of Aromatic (Medicinal...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/66605181P. aeruginosa were inhibited with 16.7 mg/ml. R. officinalis EO has also a bactericidal power. Minimal bactericidal concentrations were 4.17 mg/ml for K. pneumoniae and 33.4 mg/ml for E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. According to our results, the MBC/MIC ratios are lower than four for all strains, so both essential oils have a bactericidal power against the tested strains. In Turkey (Izmir), Yesil Celiktas et al. (2007) worked on R. officinalis and found the following MIC: E. coli (20 mg/ml), S. aureus (10 mg/ml), P. aeruginosa (10 mg/ml), and K. pneumoniae (20 mg/ml). Okoh et al. [45] found that South African sample of R. officinalis (oriental region of the Cape) exhibited the following MIC: E. coli (7.5 mg/ml), S. aureus (3.75 mg/ml), and K. pneumoniae (0.94 mg/ml).8. Brain, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and other medicinal usesIt is used as carminative, rubifacient, and stimulant and as flavoring agent for liniments, hair lotions, inhaler, soaps, and cosmetics. Rosemary leaves have many traditional uses based on their antibacterial and spasmolytic actions. They are used orally for the treatment of dyspep-tic complaints, and in external applications for supportive management of rheumatic com-plaints and circulatory disorders. Aetheroleum Rosmarini crude drug may enhance cognition. It is used as a cholagogue, diaphoretic, digestant, diuretic, emmenagogue, laxative, and tonic and also used in the management of headache, menstrual disorders, nervous menstrual com-plaints, tiredness, defective memory, sprains, and bruises:1. Brain and nervous system conditions.2. Cardiovascular conditions: It improves circulation, raises blood pressure, and stimulates the weak heart subject to palpitation when consumed in small doses.3. Gastrointestinal circulatory systems: In conditions of bad breath, and stomach upset. Promotes proper digestion, toning, and calming effect on the digestion.4. Reproductive system conditions: Stimulates the sexual organs.5. Respiratory system: Colds and colic.6. Other uses: The oil is used as perfume in ointments, shampoos, and soaps. The flowers are laid in clothes and cupboards to destroy moths. The leaves are crushed into meats, fish, potato salads, and so on.9.

ConclusionR. officinalis is the native plant of Iraq. It contains chemical constitutions which may be useful for various herbal formulations as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, cardiac tonic, and antiasthmatic. The phytochemical screening of the species has highlighted that both plants contain flavonoids, tannins, sterols and triterpenes, saponins, free anthraquinones, mucilages, Phytochemistry, Antioxidant, Antibacterial Activity, and Medicinal Uses of Aromatic (Medicinal...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/66605183cardiac glycosides, and catechols. Preliminary results of antibacterial study showed in vitro efficiency of R. officinalis and R. eriocalyx on all tested bacteria with minimum inhibitory con-centrations ranging from 1.04 to 16.7 mg/ml. The results presented here may contribute to the knowledge of antimicrobial potential of these species. Other studies on extracts activities of these species are needed to compare them with essential oils activity. Rosemary is an exotic evergreen shrub with multiple medicinal and cosmetic properties. It is a popular herb which serves as flavoring agent and spice. Although it is well renowned for all these potencies, the oil of the plant is adhered with many side effects and hence lacks safety data. Therefore, the use of rosemary in pediatrics, as well as in pregnant women, should be always dealt with utmost care. It could be concluded that R. officinalis displays a wide variation in essential oil chemical composition in correlation with the climatic conditions under which it is grown, as well as the genetic variation, thus generating different chemotypes.AcknowledgementsI thank Dr. Abdul-Kareem Al-Bermani, Lecturer, Department of Biology, for valuable sugges-tions and encouragement.Author detailsImad Hadi Hameed1,* and Ghaidaa Jihadi Mohammed2*Address all correspondence to: imad_dna@yahoo.com1 Department of Nursing, Babylon University, Hilla City, Hillah, Iraq2 College of Science, Al-Qadisiya University, Al Diwaniyah, IraqReferences[1] Atik F, Bousmaha L, Taleb Bendiab SA, Boti JB.
