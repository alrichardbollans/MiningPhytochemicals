Pharmacia 72: 1\u20138. https://doi.org/10.3897/pharmacia.72.e151142AbstractThis study employed an untargeted metabolomic approach combined with chemometrics to investigate differences in the phyto-chemical composition of Cecropia peltata samples collected on the mainland and islands of the Panamanian Pacific. Twenty-three samples of C. peltata leaves were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis (LC-HRESI-MS). The results revealed a significant diversity of secondary metabolites. A supervised chemometric analysis model (OPLS-DA) was applied to differentiate specimens collected on the mainland from those collected on the islands. Among the me-tabolites identified as potential chemical markers in the studied specimens, five belong to the group of triterpenoid saponins. These compounds showed a significantly higher relative abundance in samples collected on the mainland than those collected on islands. In conclusion, this study highlights the chemical variability within C. peltata based on its geographic location. The findings suggest the importance of considering geographic origin when evaluating the therapeutic potential of this plant species in traditional and pharmaceutical medicine.KeywordsCecropia peltata, metabolomic analysis, triterpenoid saponins, chemometrics, geographic originCopyright Zarev Y et al.

Chemotaxonomy attempts to avoid replacing or supplanting phylogenetic research and analysis of the DNA sequence. However, its data could be utilized to sup-port species through chemical characterization (Zidorn 2019). In this sense, chemotaxonomy can be a valuable tool to tackle challenging matters that could affect the formation of natural plant classifications in general (Fair-brothers et al. 1975; Reynolds 2007).The Cecropia genus consists of more than 60 species that are widely distributed in Mexico, Panama, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Cecropia was first described as part of the Moraceae family, later classified as a new independent family, Cecropiaceae, and more recently, researchers have approached it as part of the Urticaceae family (Berg 1978). Most well-known and studied species include C. pachys-tachya, C. peltata, C. lyratiloba, C. obtusifolia, C. palmata, C. glaziovii, and C. hololeuca. The chemical compounds found in the Cecropia genus are most commonly terpenoids, flavo-noids, and proanthocyanidins. \u03b2-sitosterol and ursolic acid have been isolated from C. palmata and C. obtusa. Orientin, isoorientin, and isovitexin were identified in C. glaziovii and C. lyratiloba. On the other hand, pomolic and oleanolic ac-ids were found in C. pachystachya (Costa et al. 2011).Plants of the Cecropia genus, commonly known as \u201cguarumo,\u201d \u201cyarumo,\u201d \u201cemba\u00faba,\u201d imba\u00faba, and \u201cam-bay,\u201d which means hollow trunk in the Tup\u00ed language, are plants used in Latin American countries to treat various diseases or conditions (Berg 1978). In folk medicine, des-iccated leaves of this plant were commonly consumed in infusion primarily to treat diabetes mellitus but were also taken as an inflammation-reducing remedy. A study com-paring C. obtusifolia and C. peltata showed that C. peltata has an exceedingly better hypoglycemic effect than C. ob-tusifolia (Nicasio et al. 2005). C. pachystachya is another species with traditional use in the antidiabetic treatment in folk medicine (Salam et al. 2023). In the Mexican cul-ture, the plant parts (stem, root, bark, and leaves) are com-monly applied in the treatment of blood sugar disorders in diabetic patients. In addition, leaf decoctions of the Cecropia plant are used in the Republic of El Salvador as a tranquilizer and for treating rheumatic diseases, among which are arthritis and gout. In another Central Ameri-can country \u2013 Costa Rica \u2013 the Cecropia plant is widely used in the standard of care for high blood pressure and as a diuresis-increasing remedy (Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2021). C. glaziovii was discovered to have an intriguing antiviral action, and its activity was studied on the type 1 and type 2 herpes simplex viruses. The mechanism of action was found to be the inhibition of cell entry for both types, which reduces viral virulence (Silva et al. 2010). However, the lack of knowledge about the chemical com-position and mechanism of action related to its therapeu-tic properties represents a significant challenge to validate the medicinal use of these medicinal plants. Since the cur-rent taxonomic research on the Cecropia genus particu-larly relies on anatomical and morphological data (Berg 1978), a detailed examination of the phytochemical profile of Cecropia could help distinguish between species, offer-ing valuable insights for a more comprehensive taxonomic understanding of this genus.In earlier research conducted by our team, the chemi-cal composition of various Cecropia species was analyzed. These species were chosen because they are abundant-ly found in accessible areas in the provinces of Panama, West Panama, Chiriqu\u00ed, and Dari\u00e9n (Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2017; Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2019a). An interest-ing finding was the variation in the phytochemical com-ponents found in various species of this genus (Ortiz et al. 2019; Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2019a). Our research group identified several issues that are worth covering within the present research study. One of them involves the existence of two morphotypes in C. obtusifolia with different chemical compositions depending on their ori-gin. This species suggests the potential for chemical differ-ences between specimens growing on the mainland and those in insular areas, resulting in two distinct entities from a chemical perspective. Specifically, in the case of medicinal plants, such as the C. peltata species, the use of these plants with inappropriate phytochemical profiles could lead to erroneous interpretations in pharmaceutical research on medicinal products.Considering that C. peltata is a plant widely used in tra-ditional medicine and ethnopharmacology, this research project seeks to differentiate C. peltata species found on land and in the Pacific islands of Panama through a non-tar-geted metabolomic approach as an innovative strategy. To achieve this purpose, we propose to use a metabolomic analysis of the specimens under study using modern chro-matographic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry, together with chemometric (multivariate) analyses.Materials and methodsGeneral experimental proceduresFor the purposes of our study, the leaves of twenty-three samples of C. peltata on land and on the largest island in the Central American region \u2013 Coiba Island, located in the Gulf of Chiriqu\u00ed, Panamanian province of Veraguas \u2013 were collected manually. This study focused on qualitative metabolomic analysis to compare the phytochemical com-position of C. peltata samples. The assessment was based on the relative abundance of metabolites detected in the LC-HRESI-MS analysis, rather than a fully quantitative determination of metabolite concentrations. Plant materi-al was taxonomically classified by Prof. Orlando Ortiz and deposited at the Herbarium of the University of Panama (Table 1). To carry out this research project, a permit for the collection and export of specimens for scientific pur-poses was requested and received from the Ministry of the Environment (MiAmbiente, Republic of Panama).Pharmacia 72: 1\u20138 3Preparation of extractsTo prepare the extracts, the leaves were dried in an oven at 40 \u00b0C for 3 days and then pulverized to obtain a fine pow-der (1.0 mm). The ground material was then stored in the herbarium under controlled conditions (20\u201325 \u00b0C) until further analysis. The plant material (1 g) was transferred to a 50 mL flask with a conical bottom, and 15 mL of 70% (v/v) MeOH was added to it. For exhausted extraction, the probe was placed in an ultrasonic bath (42 kHz, 100 W) (Model Branson 3510, Danbury, USA) at a temperature of 35 \u00b0C for 30 min. Once the extraction was achieved, the generated extract was centrifuged (Heraeus Labofuge, Germany) at 3000 g for 5 min. The combined MeOH extracts were evaporated and defatted three times with 50 mL of n-hexane each time. This extraction effectively removed chlorophyll and oils from the samples. The defat-ted extract was transferred into a 50 mL volumetric flask. Finally, the resulting extracts were diluted at a 1:2 ratio with 10% (v/v) MeOH. The samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C before being used in subsequent analysis (Rivera-Mon-drag\u00f3n et al. 2019b).Liquid chromatography-high resolution spectrometry (LC-HRESI-MS) analysisLC-HRESI-MS analysis was carried out on the UHPLC system (Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC system, ThermoFish-er Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer with heated electrospray ionization (HESI) ion source (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). LC separations were car-ried out on a Kinetex RP-18 column (2.10 mm \u00d7 100 mm, 2.6 \u00b5m, Phenomenex Corporation, Torrence, CA, USA) at 40 \u00b0C. Elution was performed with a mobile phase consist-ing of H2O + 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile also with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (B), which were pumped at a rate of 0.3 mL/min. A gradient program was set up as follows: 5% B (0\u20130.5 min), 85% B (0.5\u201320 min), 95% B (20\u201320.5 min), and full scan data were recorded in nega-tive electrospray ionization (ESI-) mode from m/z 150 to 1500 with a resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 200). The oper-ating conditions of the HR-ESI ionization source were at -2.5 or +3.5 kV and a capillary temperature of 320 \u00b0C, a sheath gas flow of 25 arbitrary units, and an auxiliary gas flow of 5 units (both N2). All other detector parameters were adjusted such that the most intense [M-H]- signal was obtained. The MS scan was followed by a full dd-MS/MS scan of the five highest intensity ions above an abso-lute threshold of 3,000 counts with a resolution of 17,500 (at m/z 200). The diluted extract (mentioned in the previ-ous section) was further diluted by adding 100 \u00b5L of the extract to 900 \u00b5L of H2O/MeOH (60 : 40). The sample in-jection volume was set at 1 \u00b5L. All data were recorded and processed using Xcalibur software, version 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, Germany).Data processing for untargeted metab-olomic analysisIn the process, raw files were subjected to the data mining software MZmine 2.53.

MZmine parameters were set as follows: Feature extraction for MS was achieved with a signal threshold of 1.0 \u00d7 104 and 1.0 \u00d7 102 for MS/MS. A centroid algorithm was used. The chromatogram builder was run using the ADAP Module (Myers et al. 2017) with a minimum cluster size/number of scans of 5, a cluster intensity threshold of 5.0 \u00d7 104, a minimum high-est intensity of 1.0 \u00d7 105, and an m/z tolerance of 0.0020 or 5 ppm. Chromatograms were deconvoluted with an m/z range tolerance of 5 ppm and a retention time tolerance (0.1 min). The detected peaks were aligned via the Join Aligner Module, considering a mass (5 ppm), 75% wt for m/z, and 25% for retention time. Normalized peak areas were converted to comma-separated values (.csv) and subsequently considered for chemometric analysis.Chemometric analysisThe chemometric analysis was performed using Metabo-Analyst 5.0 software (Pang et al. 2022). In the initial stage, processed data was normalized by transforming variables to a logarithm base 10, and then autoscaling was applied (centered on the mean and divided by the standard devi-ation of each variable). Supervised discriminant analysis of orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS-DA) was conducted to identify differences in metabolite composition in the samples. Model quality was assessed using the goodness of fit parameter (R2) and the model\u2019s goodness of prediction (Q2) (Fig. 1). The variable im-portance in projection (VIP) approach was used to select those variables that had the highest discrimination po-tential (considering a VIP score > 1.5) in the OPLS-DA models. These variables were subsequently recognized as putative chemical markers.Phytochemical characterizationDuring the phytochemical characterization, metabolites were identified using authentic standards or by comparison of MS and MS/MS data with those reported in scientific literature and common MS databases, such as the Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and Mass-Bank (https://massbank.eu). A precision error of 5 ppm was set in the MS search, and fragments were verified in the MS/MS search. The chemical composition of the methanolic ex-tracts was defined according to the confirmation levels (CL) proposed by Schymanski et al. 2014: Level 1 (L1) - structure validated by reference standard; Level 2a (L2a) - probable structure by match with library spectrum or previously de-scribed in the literature; Level 3 (L3) - tentative candidates constructed on experimental MS and MS/MS data.Results and discussionMass spectrometry (MS) analyses of methanolic extracts of C. peltata leaves revealed an exceptional variety of sec-ondary metabolites, with a total of 444 peaks detected in the 23 plant samples used for the current study. For this investigation, the negative ionization mode was employed, which allowed for obtaining of more complex metabolite profiles for each extract.To initiate chemometric analysis, a supervised OPLS-DA model was applied to identify the metabolites that pos-sibly contribute to differentiating specimens collected on land from those collected on islands. The generated mod-el demonstrated a robust performance (R2 = 0.69) and a significant predictive capacity (Q2 = 0.22). The OPLS-DA score plot (see Fig. 2A) revealed the presence of two dis-tinct clusters, which allowed a clear differentiation between samples collected on land and those collected on islands. Specifically, extracts obtained from samples collected on Figure 1. Permutation test for the OPLS-DA model showing R2 and Q2 values.Pharmacia 72: 1\u20138 5land showed a separate and distinct cluster corresponding to samples collected on islands, indicating the presence of specific metabolites responsible for the differentiation be-tween the two groups. Fig. 2B details the most relevant dis-criminating metabolites (identified by OPLS-DA), ranked by their variable importance in the projection (VIP). The relative abundance of each of these key metabolites is rep-resented by a color code ranging from blue (low abun-dance) to red (high abundance). It is worth noting that the higher the VIP score is, the greater the potential of the me-tabolite to differentiate between the two groups analyzed. During this analysis, only metabolites with a VIP score greater than 1.5 were considered.The identified metabolites were characterized by com-parison of MS and MS/MS data with records available in scientific publications and common MS databases, such as the Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca) and MassBank (https://massbank.eu). For the MS search, a precision error margin of 5 ppm was established. It is important to note that this study employed a qualitative metabolomic approach. While the OPLS-DA model iden-tified key metabolites with differential relative abundance, this does not represent a fully quantitative analysis, as ab-solute concentrations of metabolites were not determined.Among the highest-scoring metabolites (VIP > 1.5) that were considered as potential chemical markers, five compounds were identified as the main metabolites strongly associated with the phytochemical difference be-tween the two groups under study (see Table 2 and Fig. 3). These compounds, namely, buergericic acid (isomer 1), buergericic acid (isomer 2), euscaphic acid (isomer 1), niga-ichigoside F2, and euscaphic acid (isomer 2), are classified as triterpene saponins.As shown in Fig. 3A\u2013C, compounds from 1 to 5 exhibit a significantly higher relative abundance in the group of samples collected on land compared to those collected on islands. This observation underlines the potential of these metabolites identified as distinctive markers in the differ-entiation of C. peltata from different localities.This study employed an untargeted metabolomic ap-proach using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS to differentiate C. peltata samples collected from mainland and island en-vironments in Panama. The findings revealed differences between the two geographic regions, highlighting the role of environmental factors in shaping the metabolite profiles of this species. The supervised OPLS-DA model provided robust differentiation between samples from mainland and island locations. This model identified five triterpene saponins, buergericic acid (isomers 1 and 2), euscaphic acid (isomers 1 and 2), and niga-ichigoside F2 as the most significant chemical markers. These compounds showed higher relative abundance in mainland samples. However, it is plausible that island plants produce lower quantities of certain defensive compounds as an adaptive response to the absence of specialized predators.While the findings provide valuable insights, some lim-itations must be acknowledged. First, the relatively small sample size from island locations may reduce the applica-bility of the results. Future studies should aim to include a larger number of samples from both regions to strengthen the robustness of the conclusions. Second, environmental factors such as soil nutrients, light availability, and biotic in-teractions (e.g., herbivory or pathogen exposure) were not quantified in this study. Such factors are known to influence secondary metabolite production and should be incorporat-ed into future investigations to provide a more holistic un-derstanding of the observed variability (Salam et al. 2023).Additionally, the predictive capacity of the OPLS-DA model (Q2 = 0.29) was moderate, suggesting that while the model effectively distinguishes the two groups, fur-ther validation is needed. Permutation testing conducted as part of this study demonstrated the robustness of the model but also highlighted the exploratory nature of the analysis. Expanding the dataset with temporal sampling Figure 2. A. Score plot of the OPLS model; B. The most significant discriminant metabolites (identified by OPLS-DA) ranked by variable importance in projection (VIP). The relative abundance of every important metabolite is indicated by a color code, ranging from blue (low abundance) to red (high abundance). The higher the VIP score, the greater the potential of the metabolite to differ-entiate the two study groups. Only metabolites with a VIP score > 1.5 were considered.Zarev Y et al.: Untargeted UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS analysis of Cecropia peltata6across different seasons or growth stages could enhance the reliability of these findings. The identification of tri-terpene saponins as key chemical markers is consistent with previous reports emphasizing their abundance in Cecropia species (Costa et al. 2011; Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2019a). These compounds have been associated with various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflam-matory, antiviral, and hypoglycemic effects, underscoring their relevance to the medicinal potential of C. peltata (Costa et al. 2011; Rivera-Mondrag\u00f3n et al. 2021). By iden-tifying these compounds as potential geographic markers, our study highlights the need to consider environmental factors in the standardization and quality control of herbal preparations derived from C. peltata.Differences in metabolite abundance may influence the pharmacological efficacy of extracts derived from plants collected in different locations. For example, mainland samples, which exhibited higher levels of the identified triterpenes, may possess enhanced bioactivity compared to island samples.ConclusionThe findings of this research offer proof that the phyto-chemical composition of C. peltata varies depending on the location from which the plants are collected. This information is important for researchers working on the extraction of compounds from this plant species, as it suggests that the biological activity of the plant may vary depending on its origin. Additionally, this study identifies five triterpene saponins as potential phytochemical mark-ers to differentiate C. peltata collected on land from that collected on islands. This information can be used to de-velop quality control methods for the plant.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the National Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENACYT) of the Repub-lic of Panama for financially supporting Dr. Rivera-Mon-drag\u00f3n through the National Research System (SNI) in-centive program.
