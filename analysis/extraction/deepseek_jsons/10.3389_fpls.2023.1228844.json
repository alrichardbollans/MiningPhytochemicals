In order to study the effect of chromosome doubling on Thymus vulgaris,three levels of colchicine concentration including 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5% (w/v) wereapplied for 6, 12 and 24 hours on apical meristem of 2- and 4-leaf seedlings.Ploidy level was evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopic chromosomecounting. Chemical composition of essential oils extracted by hydro-distillationwas analyzed by gas Chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gasChromatography (GC). The application of 0.3% colchicine at 4-leaf seedlingfor 6 hours resulted in the highest survival rate and the highest number oftetraploid plants. Cytogenetic and flow cytometry analyses confirmed theincrease of chromosome number from 2n=2x=30 in diploids to 2n=4x=60 ininduced tetraploids. Tetraploid plants had larger leaves, taller and thicker stems,dense branching, longer trichome, larger stomata, larger guard cells, anddecreased number of stomata. The number of chloroplasts and mitochondriaincreased significantly in tetraploid plants by 1.66 and 1.63 times, respectively.The expression of CYP71D178, CYP71D180 and CYP71D181 increased intetraploids by 3.27, 7.39 and 2.15 times, respectively, probably resulting inhigher essential oil compounds, as tetraploids outyielded the diploid plants by64.7% in essential oil, 40.9% in thymol and 18.6% in carvacrol content.KEYWORDSThymus vulgaris, induced polyploidy, gene expression, thymol, carvacrolIntroductionGarden thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important medicinal andaromatic plants. Besides common culinary and seasoning use, the antibacterial, anti-spasmolytic, antitumor and antiviral properties have made it very useful forpharmaceuticals especially for cough remedy (Satyal et al., 2016; Salma et al., 2017;frontiersin.org01Mohammadi et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1228844Salehi et al., 2018; Mondak et al., 2020; Nieto, 2020; Galovic\u030cova\u0301et al., 2021). Very few efforts, however, have been made towardsgenetic improvement of this plant.Increasing the number of chromosomes which is calledploploidy is one of the tools for plants improvement. Polyploidyhas played an important role in plant breeding and also plantevolution (Sleper and Poehlman, 2006; Iannicelli et al., 2020;Madani et al. , 2021). Winkler (1916) coined the term\u201cpolyploidy\u201d in a study of vegetative grafts in Solanum, when hediscovered tetraploid plants regenerated from callus tissue on cutstems of diploid S. nigrum. Winge (1917) proposed thatspontaneous chromosome doubling, resulting from accidentalsomatic doubling in mitosis or non-reduction in meiosis, couldconvert interspecific sterile hybrids into fertile types. Grant (1981)postulated that 47% of all flowering plants were of polyploidy originand proposed that 58% of monocots and 43% of dicots werepolyploid. As polyploidization has made a great contribution tothe evolution of many species, plant breeders try to take advantageof induced polyploidy in their programs. The hypothesis is thatpolyploidy may lead to useful characteristics like larger vegetativeand reproductive organs (Adaniya and Shirai, 2001; Liqin et al.,2019; Madani et al., 2021). In addition, more than 90% of thereviewed experimental data point toward a positive impact of ploidylevel on the ability of plants to cope with different kinds of bioticand abiotic stresses (Tossi et al., 2022).Polyploidization can be induced by quite a few antimitoticagents. The most frequently used antimitotic chemicals arecolchicine, trifluralin, and oryzalin. The whole method of inducedchromosome doubling consists of a series of steps, including aninduction phase, regrowth phase, and a confirmation technique toevaluate the rate of achievement (Salma et al., 2017). Blakeslee andAvery (1937) were among pioneers discovered the induction ofpolyploidy by colchicine. Induced polyploidy has been tried inseveral crop plants. Chen et al. (1945) generated autotetraploidbarley plants by the use of colchicine and observed variousirregularities in chromosome configuration as well as regularbivalents in a few lines. They also reported that the fertility of the4n plants as a whole was lower than that of the diploids.Compared with the original diploid, autotetraploid rice showedsuperior agronomic characters, such as larger panicle, larger seedand stronger stem, while seed-setting rate and fertility was lowerthan that in its diploid varieties (Song and Zhang, 1992; Chenet al., 2021).Guo and Birchler (1994) studied dosage effects on geneexpression in monoploid, diploid, triploid, and tetraploid maizeplants and showed that for most tested genes, the transcript levelper cell was directly proportional to structural gene dosage. Study ofphenotypic and proteome changes in 2X, 4X and 6X ploidy series ofmaize revealed that plants of higher ploidy exhibited increased cellsize but slower growth rate, later flowering, fewer tassel branches aswell as reduced stature and fertility while the expression of mostproteins increased linearly with ploidy (Yao et al., 2011).Javadian et al. (2017) reported that induced tetraploidyincreased podophyllotoxin content in the leaves and stems ofLinum album by upregulating the expression level and enzymeactivity of genes involved in the pathway.Frontiers in Plant Science 02Sabzehzari et al. (2019) demonstrated that induced tetraploidplants of Ispaghul (Plantago psyllium) were larger than their intactdiploids in terms of height, leaf thickness, seed size, pollen grain,seeds per spike, number of guard cells and stomata size as well aschlorophyll and carotenoid content.Besides experimental studies, induced polyploidy has long beenused by plant breeders in commercial genetic improvement of sugarbeet, seedless watermelon, rye, red clovers and ryegrass (Sattleret al., 2016). Polyploidy induction has also been widely applied toornamental crops breeding, resulting in the extension of flowerlongevity, larger flower size and deep flower colors. Tulips andazalea are two examples with large number of induced polyploidcommercial cultivars (Jones et al., 2007; Marasek-Ciolakowskaet al., 2012)Due to increased number of gene copies, artificially inducedpolyploidy may increase enzymatic content and activity thatcontribute to enhanced secondary metabolites of medicinal plants(Dhawan and Lavania, 1996; Iannicelli et al., 2020). The tetraploidforms of Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L) outperform theirdiploid relatives in both biochemical and morphological traitsincluding essential oils, bisaboloids, chamazulene, apigenin,favonoids, height, capitulum size and weight and dry seed weight.Currently almost one quarter of the chamomile varieties cultivatedworldwide are tetraploids induced by colchicine, highlighting thesuccess of polyploidy breeding establishment in this medicinal crop(Das, 2014). The cultivated tetraploid chamomile varieties, Luteaand Goral, for instance, have been shown to produce 20% higherchamazulene (one of the valuable medicinal components ofchamomile essential oil) than diploid cultivars (Gosztola et al.,2006). Tavan et al. (2015) used colchicine for ploidy induction inThymus persicus nodal shoot tip explants and observed a higheramount of pentacyclic triterpenoids in induced tetraploids. Braynenet al. (2021) showed that the key genes promoting floral formationwere down-regulated, whereas floral transition genes and aflowering locus were up-regulated in autotetraploid Brassica rapa.Iannicelli et al. (2020) reviewed the application of polyploidy inbreeding of aromatic and medicinal species. Dhawan and Lavania(1996); Salma et al. (2017) and Madani et al. (2021) also reviewedthe influence of artificial polyploidization on secondary metabolitescontent in medicinal plants.Alsahlany et al. (2019) and Kramer and Bamberg (2019) studiedguard cell size and number of chloroplasts per guard cell in potatotrying to find a reliable simple tool to identify ploidy level. There hasbeen very few attempts in the literature to induce polyploidy inThymus vulgaris. Shmeit et al. (2020) treated nodal segments ofthyme with 80mM centration of oryzalin for 24 hours andregenerated tetraploid plants on MS culture medium. Theyreported increased plant size and secondary metabolites intetraploids. Navra\u0301tilova\u0301 et al. (2021) tried in vitro polyploidizationof diploid thyme explants by 0.346 and 1.73 mg L\u22121 oryzalin anddeveloped tetraploid plants containing higher proportions ofthymol and carvacrol. As both researches were carried out underresource- and facility-demanding in vitro condition, we aimed atthis study to develop a more efficient colchicine-based protocol forin vivo polyploidization of Thymus vulgaris and to evaluate the itseffect on physiological, anatomical, and phytochemical features.frontiersin.orgMohammadi et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1228844Material and methodsPolyploidy inductionThymus vulgaris seeds were planted in small pots filled withcocopeat and kept in a normal glass house with 16 hours day length,26/18\u00b0C (day/night). Plants at 2- and 4-leaf stages were selected forcolchicine treatment. Stock colchicine (Sigma\u00ae) solutions wereprepared in sterilized distilled water. Two drops of 2% (v/v)dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Tween20 were added to increasecell permeability and colchicine absorption (G\u0142owacka et al., 2009).5 mL colchicine solution was dropped on apical meristem ofseedlings and secured by a piece of cotton covered withaluminum foil to avoid evaporation. Three levels of colchicineconcentration including 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5% (w/v) were applied for6, 12 and 24 hours. Each treatment was run in 5 replications.Seedlings were then rinsed smoothly with water spray. Two weeksafter treatment, plants were moved to bigger pots filled with soil,sand and cocopeat (3:2:1).Flow cytometryThree months after seedlings treatment, plants showing atypicalmorphology (i.e. leaf thickness, shape, color, and size; shorterinternodes) were selected as putative tetraploids. Ploidy level ofselected plants were analyzed according to the method described byLoureiro et al. (2007) and Javadian et al. (2017). Soybean (Glycinemax) variety Polanka (2C DNA = 2.50 pg) was used as standardreference plant (Dolezel et al., 1994). 25 mg leaf samples fromputative plants as well as 25 mg from standard soybean weresubmerged in one mL Woody Buffer Plant (Loureiro et al., 2007)and chopped with a sharp razor blade. The suspension of isolatednuclei was filtered through a Partec 30 mm nylon mesh filters(Partec, Munster, Germany) to remove cell debris. The nuclearsuspension of each sample was treated with 50 mg mL-1 RNase(Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, MO, USA) to prevent staining ofdouble-stranded RNA and stained with mg mL-1 propidiumiodide (PI, Fluka). Samples were then incubated on ice andanalyzed by BDFACanto \u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,Bedford, MA, USA), using the BD FACSDiva\u2122 Software. Morethan 5000 stained nuclei were analyzed per sample. Data were firsttransferred to Flowing Software version 2.5.0, followed by PartecFloMax Software version 2.4e (Partec, Munster, Germany). Instableplants with both diploid and tetraploid cells (mixoploids)were removed.Cytogenetic testTo confirm tetraploidy, chromosomes of the plants demonstratingDNA doubling in flow cytometry as well as control diploid plants werecounted. 5-6 cm cuttings were made from each plant and regeneratedto root. 1 cm long root tips were sampled and pretreated with 1% a-Frontiers in Plant Science 03monobromonaphthalene for 3h at 4\u00b0C temperature followed byrinsing with distilled water for 10min. Chromosome fixation wascarried out using Carnoy\u2019s solution consisting of 1part glacial aceticacid and 3 parts ethanol (95 to 100%) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C followed by10min rinsing with distilled water. Roots, then, hydrolyzed in 1 NHClfor 15min at 60\u00b0C followed by 30min rinsing. Specimens were stainedwith aceto orcein (2%) solution for 4 h. The stained root tips, 2 mmlong, were squashed on a glass slide. The number of chromosomes wascounted under Olympus DP70 light microscope equipped with acamera. Survival rate and tetraploid induction rate was calculated bythe number of achieved tetraploid plants from each treatment dividedby all treated plants.Measurement of morphological traitsAll diploid and tetraploid plants were carefully monitored forimportant morphological traits after colchicine treatment. Plantheight, leaf length, width and thickness, main stem diameter andinternode distance were measured four months after treatmentwhen the plants has become stable.Cellular featuresSix diploid and six tetraploid plants (derived from 0.3%colchicine treatment for 6 hours at 4-leaf seedling) were selectedfor further cellular, physiological and biochemical measurements.Stomata length, width and density, trichome length and intensity aswell as guard cells length and number (in a microscopic view scope)were measured using epidermis layer of three expanded leaves bycolorless varnish (Smith et al., 1989). To make the epidermis layerprepared, the expanded leaves were dried, and the epidermis wasseparated using a piece of banderol. Separated epidermis were fixedon glass slides. The number of chloroplasts and mitochondria werecounted in 150-200 guard cells in diploid and tetraploid plants\u2019leaves (Figure 1). 1% Janus Green powder (Merck\u2122) solution wasused to stain mitochondria.Phytochemical measurementsThyme samples were dried at room condition (20\u201325\u00b0 C) undershade for 72 hours. To assess the essential oil content, the shadedried samples were subjected to the hydro-distillation method for 3hours with 250 mL water, using a Clevenger-type apparatusaccording to the British Pharmacopoeia (HMSO, 1988). Essentialoil content was calculated by dividing mass essential oil to mass drymatter. The isolated oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfateand stored in tightly closed dark vials at 4\u00b0C for further analyses.Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed using aThermoquest gas chromatograph equipped with fused silicacapillary DB-5 column (25 m\u00d70.25 mm i.d.; film thickness 0.25\u00b5m). The injector and detector temperatures were kept at 250 andfrontiersin.orgMohammadi et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1228844280\u00b0C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flowrate of 1.1 mL/min; oven temperature program was 60\u2013250\u00b0C at therate of 4\u00b0C/min and finally held isothermally for 10 min; split ratiowas 1:50.Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis wascarried out by use of Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatographequipped with fused silica capillary DB-5 column (60 m\u00d70.25 mmi.d.; film thickness 0.25 \u00b5m) coupled with a TRACE mass(Manchester, UK). Helium was used as carrier gas with ionizationvoltage of 70 eV. Ion source and interface temperatures were 200and 250\u00b0C, respectively. Mass range was from 35 to 456 amu. Oventemperature program was the same as mentioned above for the GC.The constituents of the essential oils were calculated according toHadian et al. (2014).Total Chlorophyll (a+b) content was evaluated in tetraploid anddiploid plants by the method described by Lichtenthaler (1987)using spectrophotometer (UV/Vis 2100 model). The absorbancewas read by spectrophotometer (UV/Vis 2100 model) at 645 and663 nm wavelengths. The pigments content was calculated based onthe equations elucidated in Lichtenthaler and Wellburn (1983) andexpressed as mg/g fresh weight.Gene expressionTotal RNA was isolated and purified from thyme leaves usingRNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The quality ofthe RNA samples was assessed in an agarose gel 2%, and itsconcentration was determined with a nanodrop. To removecontaminating DNA, RNAs were treated with DNaseI, RNase-free(Thermo. Fisher Scientific, Fermentas). DNase-treated RNAsamples (1 mg) were reverse-transcribed using RevertAid\u2122 FirstStrand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas, K1622) to finally obtain a20 mg cDNA. Specific primers for three cytochromes involved inFrontiers in Plant Science 04thymol and carvacrol Biosynthesis including CYP71D178,CYP71D180 and CYP71D181 were designed based on Crocollet al. (2010) and were checked by Primer3 Software with thefollowing parameters: melting temperature of 60 \u00b0C, PCR productlength range 120\u2013200 bp pairs and Guanine-Cytosine contentsfrom 50 to 60%. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed usingthe fluorescent SYBRGreen dye with BIOPRAD System. Relativequantification of gene expression was calculated by the 2-DDCTmethod (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) considering Brassica napusactin gene as the internal standardData analysisThe impact of different concentration and duration ofcolchicine treatments at 2- and 4-leaf growth stages on survivalrate and the number of tetraploid plants were statistically analyzedon the basis of completely randomized design ANOVA. The meanvalues were compared using the Duncan\u2019s test by SAS 9 software(SAS Institute Inc. 2013).ResultsPolyploidy induction viacolchicine treatmentThe higher concentration of colchicine resulted in less plantsurvival at both 2-leaf and 4-leaf stages (Figure 2). Out of 18treatments including three concentrations of colchicine (0.1, 0.3and 0.5%), three times of application (6, 12 and 24 hours), and twostages (2- and 4-leaf), six treatments failed to raise any polyploidplants. Only application for 6 hours of 0.3% colchicine at 2- and 4-leaf stage and 0.1% at 4-leaf stage appeared to be successful forinducing polyploidization, the very first being the most efficientone (Figure 3).Cytometry and cytogenetic testPlants showing morphological changes e.g., darker leaf color,growth stunt, and low internode distance were chosen as candidatetetraploid plants and their ploidy level checked by flow cytometryand chromosome counting. The mean 2C DNA content of diploidthyme was found to be 1.88 picograms (pg) being very close to 1.54pg reported by Marie and Brown (1993). The observationsdemonstrated that genome size in tetraploid plants had beensuccessfully doubled to 3.74 pg confirming the effectiveness ofcolchicine treatment (Figure 4).To ensure the ploidy level of plants, the number ofchromosomes was counted in root tip cells of candidate tetraploidplants confirmed by flow cytometry. The number of chromosomesin diploid thyme was 2n = 2x = 30. Although some plants had 57 or,58 chromosomes, plants with exactly 60 chromosomes were chosenas autotetraploid (Figure 5).FIGURE 1Guard cells from abaxial leaf epidermis of thyme plant stained.frontiersin.orgMohammadi et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1228844Morphological traitsThere was a growth stunt in tetraploid plants up to two monthsafter treatment. Tetraploid plants exhibited taller and thicker stems,dense branching, and larger leaves (Table 1).Anatomical characteristicsThe results showed that tetraploid plants had lower number butlarger stomata than diploid plants. Trichome size was alsosignificantly increased (Table 2). The number of chloroplasts andmitochondria in tetraploid plants increased by 1.66 and 1.63 times,respectively (Table 2) while there was no significant difference intheir size compared to control diploid ones.Frontiers in Plant Science 05Expression of cytochrome genesReal-time PCR of Cytochrome genes involved in thymol andcarvacrol biosynthesis indicated that the expression of CYP71D178,CYP71D180 and CYP71D181 genes increased by 3.27-fold, 7.39-fold, and 2.15-fold in tetraploid plants compared to diploidcontrols, respectively (Figure 6).Biochemical traitsContent of main compounds in tetraploid and diploid plantsare shown in Table 3. Essential oil content, thymol, carvacrol, g-terpinene, and linalool increased in tetraploid plants, while p-Cymene, Camphor and chlorophyll content were decreased.DiscussionPolyploidy induction, cytometry andcytogenetic testsInduced polyploidy has been used by scientists in several field,medicinal and ornamental crops in order to enlarge the plantorgans or to enhance secondary metabolites production (Chenet al., 1945; Dhawan and Lavania, 1996; Zeng et al., 2006; Sattleret al., 2016; Salma et al., 2017; Madani et al., 2021). The probabledecline in seed setting of thyme induced polyploids would not makeany barrier in its cultivation, as the plant can be asexuallypropagated through cuttings.In this research, we made an attempt to double the number ofchromosomes in Thymus vulgaris in an in vivo condition. Theresults indicated that applying 0.3% colchicine on apical meristemof four-leaf stage seedlings for 6 hours was optimum treatment forpolyploidy induction leading to maximum survival and the numberof tetraploid plants (Figures 2, 3). Tavan et al. (2015) also found0.3% colchicine (although for 12 h) as the most efficient conditionfor inducing polyploidy in Thymus persicus nodal shoot tipexplants. Flow cytometry output (Figure 4) demonstrated doubledgenome size in tetraploid plants (3.74 pg) and cytogenetic analysisconfirmed the increase of chromosome number from 2n=2x=30 indiploids to 2n=4x=60 in induced tetraploids (Figure 5).Previous studies on T. vulgaris have reported tetraploidinduction and its effect on essential oil production, but thoseprocedures involved nodal segments and oryzalin, instead ofcolchicine (Shmeit et al., 2020; Navra\u0301tilova\u0301 et al., 2021).One of the concerns of in vitro ploidy induction is the lownumber of polyploid plants finally obtained, as too many plantletsare lost during tissue culture procedure from explants untilmature plants. For example, polyploidy rate has been reported7.5%, 2.3-10% and 7.8% in Shmeit et al. (2020); Navra\u0301tilova\u0301 et al.(2021), and Tavan et al. (2015) experiments, respectively, while itwas 24.8% in our study (Figure 3). In vivo polyploidization doesnot need any well-equipped tissue culture lab and this might beanother privilege.FIGURE 3Percentage of tetraploid plants obtained from different treatments:0.3% colchicine for 6 hours at 2-leaf stage (dotted bars), 0.1%colchicine for 6 hours at 4-leaf stage (hatched bars), and 0.3%colchicine for 6 hours at 4-leaf stage (black bars). The treatmentswith different letter on top are significantly different based onDuncan\u2019s test by 0.01 significant level.FIGURE 2The impact of treatment time: 6 h (black bars), 12 h (dotted bars)and 24 h (hatched bars) and colchicine concentration on plantssurvival. The treatments with the same letter on top have nosignificant difference based on Duncan\u2019s test in 0.01 significant level.frontiersin.orgMohammadi et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1228844Morphological changes in tetraploidsThere was a growth stunt in tetraploid plants up to two monthsafter treatment probably due to toxic damage and degradationcaused by colchicine (Swanson, 1957). Chen and Gao (2007) alsofound a growth retardation in Astragalus membranaceus in earlyweeks and later normal growth following ploidy induction.Tetraploid plants exhibited taller and thicker stems, densebranching, and larger leaves (Table 1), likely as a result ofincreased cell size (Comai, 2005). This result is in close agreementwith previous studies. Shmeit et al. (2020) reported increased plantweight, height, leaf length, breadth and thickness and Navra\u0301tilova\u0301et al. (2021) demonstrated shorter internodes, darker and roundedleaves, and more compact appearance in induced tetraploid plantsof thyme.A correlation between ploidy level and morphologicalcharacteristics has been reported in numerous plant species suchas Phlox subulata (Zhang et al., 2008), Tanacetum parthenium(Majdi et al., 2010), Gerbera jamesonii (Gantait et al., 2011), Lychnissenno (Nonaka et al., 2011), Ullucus tuberosus (Viehmannova et al.,2011), and Ocimum basilicum and Dracocephalum moldavica(Omidbaigi et al., 2010; Omidbaigi et al., 2012). Larger leaves ininduced tetraploids has been reported in Platanus acerifolia (Liuet al., 2007), Tanacetum parthenium (Majdi et al., 2010),Dracocephalum moldavica (Omidbaigi et al., 2010). Lower height,shorter roots, thicker stems and darker leaves have been observed inThymus persicus induced tetraploids by Tavan et al. (2015).Sabzehzari et al. (2019) also concluded that induced tetraploidFrontiers in Plant Science 06plants of Ispaghul (Plantago psyllium) were larger than theirintact diploids in terms of height, leaf thickness and seed size.Anatomical changes in tetraploidsIt has been observed by several researches that tetraploidinduction may significantly alter the length, width and number ofstomata (Cohen and Yao, 1996; Beck et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006;Liu et al., 2007). Tetraploid plants exhibited a reduced number ofstomata compared to diploid plants, but the individual stomatawere larger in size (Table 2). Longer and wider stomata and reducedstomatal density were reported by Tavan et al. (2015) in inducedtetraploids of Thymus persicus. Javadian et al. (2017) detectedincreased size of leaves and stomatal cells, while decreasedstomata density in Linum album tetraploids. Studies indicate thatin line with the increase in ploidy level, the cell incorporates morechromosomes into the nucleus, leading to an increase in cell size(Byrne et al., 1981; Kondorosi et al., 2000; Comai, 2005; Nget al., 2011).Our findings revealed that the number of chloroplasts andmitochondria increased by 1.66 and 1.63 times in tetraploidplants, respectively (Table 2) without any alteration in their sizecompared to control diploid ones. Increased chloroplast number inpolyploid plants have been reported in tomato (Koornneef et al.,1989), Triticum monococum (Hawke and Leech, 1990), watermelon(Sari et al., 1999), Medicago spp (Ghanavati et al., 2004), andOnobrychis spp (Ghanavati and Eskandari (2011).

Ordoez et al. (2017); Alsahlany et al. (2019) and Kramer andBamberg (2019) recently recommend chloroplast counting as anefficient and inexpensive method for breeders to easily differentiateploidy between diploid and tetraploid potato. Increased number ofchloroplasts (and mitochondria) in tetraploids could be arisen formincrease in the copy number of genes controlling their biogenesis inthe nucleus (Leech et al., 1981; Ghanavati et al., 2004).Expression of cytochrome genesEvidence suggest that polyploidy activates some mechanisms incell effecting DNA template and also transcription and translationleading to decrease, increase or even silence the gene expression sothat it can influence physiological and morphological traits of theplant (Adams and Wendel, 2005). In line with our findings, anenhance in transcription level of benzylisoquinoline biosynthesisgenes in Papaver bracteatum tetraploid plants has been observed byMadani et al. (2019). Braynen et al. (2021) reported the up-regulation of floral transition genes in autotetraploid Brassicarapa, too.The expression of CYP71D178, CYP71D180 and CYP71D181genes appeared to be much higher in tetraploid plants compared todiploid controls in our study (Figure 6). This result justifies thehigher amount of thymol and carvacrol in tetraploid plants(Table 3). CYP71D178, CYP71D179 and CYP71D82 are proposedto be thymol synthases while CYP71D180 and CYP71D181 beingcarvacrol synthases Crocoll et al. (2011).Cytochrome genes are known to express enzymes catalyzing anumber of oxidations of terpene metabolism and are likely to beinvolved in the reactions from g-terpinene to thymol and carvacrol.Crocoll et al. (2010) isolated eleven cytochrome P450 genesequences from oregano, thyme and marjoram and suggested aFrontiers in Plant Science 07pathway for thymol and carvacrol starting with the formation of g-terpinene by a monoterpene synthase. The second step appeared tobe catalyzed by cytochrome P450s in a two-step oxidation. Krauseet al. (2021) elucidated biosynthetic pathway of thyme maincompounds suggesting that the aromatic backbone of thymol andcarvacrol is formed by P450 mono-oxygenases in combination witha dehydrogenase via an unstable intermediate. Two additionalP450s of the CYP76S and CYP736A subfamilies catalyze thehydroxylation of thymol and carvacrol to thymohydroquinone.Biochemical changes in tetraploidsEssential oil content in tetraploid plants was 64.7% higher thanthat in diploid plants as the content increased from 0.85 to 1.4(Table 3). These results are almost the same as findings of Shmeitet al. (2020) who reported 0.81% and 1.19% essential oil in diploidand tetraploid thyme plants, respectively. Thymol, carvacrol and g-terpinene, as main medicinal compounds of thyme (Galovic\u030cova\u0301et al., 2021), were found to increase by 40.9%, 18.6% and 29.3%,respectively, in tetraploid plants (Table 3). The content of thymoland carvacrol increased by 18.01% and 0.49%, respectively intetraploid thyme plants developed by Shmeit et al. (2020).Navra\u0301tilova\u0301 et al. (2021), however, observed no difference in totalessential oil between diploids and induced tetraploids, althoughsingle analyte concentrations e.g., thymol and carvacrol wereincreased. Tohidi et al. (2021) found that carvacrol in naturaltetraploid populations of thyme was higher than diploid ones.Evidence suggests that g-terpinene is primary substrate for tothymol and carvacrol synthesis (Crocoll et al., 2010; Lima et al.,2013). So, its rise in tetraploids seems to have increased thymol andcarvacrol content as shown in Table 3. An increase of 35.6% and24% in essential oil have been reported in Carum carvi (Dijkstra andSpeckmann, 1980) andDracocephalum moldavica (Omidbaigi et al.,2010) in induced tetraploids, respectively.

Decline in chlorophyll content justifies the darkercolor in tetraploid plants leave as reported in Urgenia indica(Phulari, 2011), lemon (Afshar Mohammadian et al., 2012),Thymus persicus (Tavan et al., 2015) and Thymus vulgaris(Navra\u0301tilova\u0301 et al., 2021).ConclusionIn this research the number of chromosomes of Thymusvulgaris was doubled from 30 to 60 by an in vivo protocol and itsimpact on morphology, anatomy, phytochemistry and geneexpression was studied. Application of 0.3% colchicine for 6hours at 4-leaf seedling appeared to be optimum treatment forpolyploid induction leading to maximum survival and the numberof tetraploid plants Number of chloroplasts and mitochondria, thenumber of stomata cells and guard cells length increased. Tetraploidplants outperformed the diploid plants by 64.7% in essential oil,40.9% in thymol and 18.6% in carvacrol content. The findings ofthis research suggest that induced polyploidy has the potential toenhance the production of secondary metabolites in thyme, thusproviding opportunities for its genetic improvement.Frontiers in Plant Science 08Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author contributionsVM has proposed the idea and was project leader and the mainauthor.
