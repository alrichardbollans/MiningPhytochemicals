Nannf., Codonopsispilosula Nannf. var.modesta (Nannf.) L. T. Shen and Codonopsistangshen Oliv., and harvested, washed and dried in autumn.It belongs to the spleen and lung meridians, and has a sweettaste. In addition, it is effective in strengthening the spleen andbenefiting the lung, nourishing the blood and promoting theproduction of body fluid. It is often used to treat deficiency ofspleen and lung qi, eat less and feel tired easily, coughing anddeficient panting, deficiency of qi and blood, withered face,palpitation and shortness of breath, thirst with fluid, internalheat and thirst.In recent years, scholars at home and abroad have conductedmore in-depth research on CR. Phytochemical research shows thatthe main chemical components of CR include alkaloids, alkynes andpolyacetylenes, flavonoids, lignans, steroids, terpenoids, organicacids, volatile oils, saccharides and other components. Inaddition, the extract of CR has extensive pharmacological effects,including neuroprotective effects, protection of gastrointestinalmucosa and anti-ulcer, regulation of body immunity, anti-tumor,endocrine regulation, improvement of hematopoietic function,cardiovascular protection, anti-aging and antioxidant effects(Bian et al., 2022). In clinical application, CR is often used incombination with other traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), itcan mainly treat anemia, hypotension, digestive disorders, acuteplateau reaction (Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, thereare studies and reports indicating that CR has almost no toxic sideeffects (Feng and Gao, 2012). Furthermore, CR is also widely used inhealthcare medicines, health food, healthcare cosmetics and otherfields, such as drinks, tea, biscuits, medicated meals, moisturizingcream, etc., (Lei et al., 2022).CR is a valuable botanical drug that has received a lot ofattention for its unique medicinal value and healthcare effects. Inthis study, we collected and organized the literature on CR from1982 to the present. Except for duplicates and irrelevant literature, atotal of 192 articles related to the botany, traditional applications,phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, analytical methods andquality control, processing methods, and pharmacokinetics of CRwere systematically summarized in this paper, to provide referencesfor further development and utilization of CR and to explorepossible research directions and new prospects of CR. Inconclusion, this review is of great significance for furtherresearch and utilization of CR.2 BotanyCodonopsis Radix, a perennial botanical drug ofCampanulaceae. The stem is usually very short, and most ofthem have tumor-like stem marks. The roots are often plump,cylindrical, conical, spindle-shaped, block-shaped, oval, sphericalor rosary, and are fleshy or woody. Stems erect or twining, climbing,inclined, ascending or procumbent. Leaves alternate, opposite,clustered or pseudowhorled. Flowers are borne singly at the tipsof the main stem and lateral branches, opposite the petiole, and lessfrequently in the axils of the leaves, sometimes in scape form. CRenjoys a mild and cool climate, is cold-tolerant, and its roots canoverwinter in the open ground in the soil. It is born at the mountainforest edge and shrub at an altitude of 1560\u20133100 m. The pictures ofCR and its slices are shown in Figure 1.There are more than 40 species in the whole genus ofCodonopsis, distributed in eastern and central Asia, about39 species in China, 21 species for medicinal purposes and4 varieties. The Flora of China records that CR is produced insoutheastern Tibet, western Sichuan, northwestern Yunnan, easternGansu, southern Shaanxi, Ningxia, eastern Qinghai, Henan, Shanxi,Hebei, Inner Mongolia and northeastern China, and is cultivated inlarge quantities throughout the country. The species of RadixCodonopsis are diverse and widely distributed, and most of themare named after their traits, origin, processing characteristics, etc.,the phenomenon of different substance with the same name anddifferent meaning for the same items often occurs (Bian et al., 2022).In addition, some local Codonopsis Radix is better than genuineCodonopsis Radix in certain pharmacological activities. Forexample, Codonopsis clematidea (Schrenk) C.B.Clarke[Campanulaceae; Xinjiang Dangshen] (CCS) polysaccharides canimprove SOD activity and reduce MDA production, and its anti-freeradical effect is better than that of Lu Dangshen (Xiong et al., 2000).In some areas, Codonopsis clematidea, Codonopsis nervosa (Chipp)Nannf. [Campanulaceae; Maihua Dangshen]and Codonopsislanceolata (Sieb. et Zucc.) Trautv. [Campanulaceae; LunyeDangshen] are also often used as medicine. According to \u201ctheConPhyMP statement\u201d, we sorted out the botanical drugsinvolved in the article (Rivera et al., 2014; Heinrich et al., 2022).Besides, we compiled the geographical distribution of commonmedicinal Codonopsis (genuine and local customary) and theiridentification methods, as shown in Table 1. However, the sourceof CR is complex, and the quality of different producing areas variesgreatly, exists the phenomenon of substitute shoddy goods for goodcargo. Therefore, it is necessary for us to establish a scientific,systematic and reasonable quality control standard andevaluation system of CR to provide assurance for safe andreasonable clinical use. In addition, the sources andcharacteristics of the confusions of CR are shown inSupplementary Table S1.3 Ethnopharmacology3.1 Traditional usesCR is a commonly used tonic botanical drug in China, throughtextual research of ancient books, CR has a long medicinal history,and it has been mixed with ginseng for 1,000 years. The name ofDangshen was first recorded in the Qing Dynasty\u2019s \u201cBaicaojing\u201d, andbefore that there were similar records in the \u201cBencao\u201d, but the nameof Dangshen was not mentioned. In this section, we have compiled alist of famous writers on CR since it was recorded, to facilitate thebetter exploitation of Codonopsis Radix.It is recorded in Ben Jing Feng Yuan (Qing Dynasty, 1617\u20131700)that the Shang Dang Ren Shen, though not capable of nourishingand warming, has the power of calming and clearing the lung, and itis not as cold as the Glehnia littoralis (A.Gray) F.

According to the New Compilation ofMateria Medica (\u672c\u8349\u4ece\u65b0, AD 1757), it can tonify the stomach andspleen, and eliminate polydipsia. This effect is consistent with thediscovery in modern pharmacology that CR protects thegastrointestinal tract and enhances the function of the spleen andstomach. Gang Mu Shi Yi (\u7eb2\u76ee\u62fe\u9057, AD 1765) recorded that CRcan cure lung deficiency and benefit lung qi. It is recorded in \u201cDe PeiBen Cao\u201d (\u5f97\u914d\u672c\u8349, AD 1644\u20131911) that when Codonopsispilosula is served and steamed with honey, it can tonify thelungs. According to Ben Cao Zheng Yi (\u672c\u8349\u6b63\u4e49, AD 1920),CR can nourish the spleen and stomach, moisten the lungs andproduce fluid, and the tendons transport qi, which is not far fromPanax ginseng C. A. Mey. [Araliaceae; Ginseng Radix Et Rhizoma].Modern pharmacological studies have proved that the functions ofCR in enhancing immunity, nourishing stomach and invigoratingspleen are consistent with those in ancient books. In addition, welearned from ancient books that the efficacy of CR and GinsengRadix Et Rhizoma was similar, and it was once used as a substitutefor Ginseng Radix Et Rhizoma in clinical application. In general, forchronic asthenia such as spleen and stomach deficiency, lung qideficiency, and body fatigue and weakness, CR can be used to treatthese diseases instead of Radix Ginseng, and the two have beenmixed for thousands of years.3.2 Herb pairs applicationsHerb pair compatibility is not the stacking of any two drugs, butrather the pairing of drugs according to their properties, with thedrugs cooperating with or restricting each other to achieve a bettercurative effect. It contains the wisdom and clinical experience of pastdynasties of TCM physicians, and is a relatively fixed collocationform of two drugs in clinical TCM compatibility.CR, under the guidance of Chinese traditional medicine theory,is often used in combination with other drugs. The compatibility ofCR and Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels [Apiaceae; Angelicae SinensisRadix] can be used for patients with spleen and lung deficiency andcan significantly enhance the immune function of the body (Wanget al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2017b). CR is combined with Atractylodesmacrocephala Koidz. [Asteraceae; Atractylodis MacrocephalaeRhizoma], Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf [Polyporaceae; Poria], andGlycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC. [Fabaceae; Glycyrrhizae RadixEt Rhizoma] to treat spleen and stomach deficiency, anorexia, loosestool, and fatigue due to qi deficiency (Chen S. et al., 2002).Compatibility with Astragalus mongholicus Bunge [Fabaceae;Astragali Radix] can strengthen the effect of invigorating qi andenhancing immunity, and it is the most commonly used tonictraditional Chinese medicine (Zhou and Zhou, 2011; Shen andJin, 2012). CR is combined with Atractylodis MacrocephalaeRhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, and Rehmannia glutinosa(Gaertn.) DC. [Orobanchaceae; Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata] toinvigorate both qi and blood, and is used for treat sallowcomplexion, palpitation, and dizziness due to blood deficiency(Feng and Zhang, 2016). CR is combined with Schisandrachinensis (Turcz.) Baill. [Magnoliaceae; Schisandrae ChinensisFructus] and Ophiopogon japonicus (L. f.) Ker Gawl.[Asparagaceae, Ophiopogonis Radix] for treating lung, kidney,and fluid injury, manifested as asthenia, soreness of waist andspermatorrhea, with the effects of invigorating qi, nourishing yin,and promoting fluid production (Yan et al., 2015).3.3 Prescription applicationsCR is a traditional botanical drug commonly used in China andone of the most valuable herbs typically used. The commonly usedclinical prescriptions include Shengmaiyin (Dangshen Prescription),Shenqi Baizhu Decoction, Shiquan Dabu Pill and so on. Amongthem, Shengmaiyin is most widely used in clinical practice and hasthe effects of benefiting qi, nourishing yin and promoting fluidproduction. In addition, the common dosage forms of CR involveddecoction, pill, tablet, granule, capsule, syrup, etc. The auxiliaryprescriptions of CR commonly used in clinic summarized from theancient books of traditional Chinese medicine and ChinaPharmacopoeia are shown in Table 2.3.4 OthersAs we all know, CR is one of the traditional Chinese medicineswith homology of medicine and food. In some parts of China, CR isoften used as food in daily diet, such as porridge, soup, stew, bubblewine, tea, etc. According to \u201cChina Medicated Diet Dictionary\u201d, CRis a commonly used qi-reinforcing drug in medicinal diet fortonifying the middle, replenishing qi, and promoting fluidproduction, and is often used for the treatment of spleen andstomach deficiency, qi and blood deficiency, fatigue andweakness. In addition, Li Yan and others compiled \u201cMiao YongDangshen Zhi Bai Bing\u201d, which selected more than 100 therapeuticprescriptions of CR summarized by physicians of past dynasties.Besides, Codonopsis lanceolata has been listed as edible wildvegetable for a long time in China\u2019s border and North Korea,South Korea, Japan and other regions without any toxic or sideeffects. In 2019, the National Health and Wellness Commission ofChina and State Administration for Market Regulationissued theNotice on the pilot work of material management for 9 kinds ofsubstances, such as Codonopsis pilosula, which are traditionallyboth food and Chinese herbal medicines. Hebei Province, GansuProvince and other places have carried out pilot work of Codonopsispilosula in combination with local characteristics. In recent years,there are research teams developed Dangshen biscuits, DangshenGao, Dangshen Fu, Dangshen nougat, Dangshen Mi-jian,Dangshen-Huang-qi drinks and other products. Therefore, weorganized some common recipes of CR and their effects, asshown in Table 3. In addition, studies have also reported theapplication of CR in beauty and skin care products. Codonopsisoligosaccharides have anti-aging effect and can be used in emollientcreams (Zhou, 2021).4 PhytochemistryCR contains a variety of chemical components, mainly includingalkaloids, alkynes and polyacetylenes, flavonoids, lignans, steroids,terpenoids, organic acids, volatile oils, sugars and other components.In addition, CR is also rich in amino acids, inorganic elements andFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04Dong et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1162036TABLE 2 The prescription composition, dosage form, and efficacy of CR.NO.

The structures ofFlavonoids compounds are shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Atpresent, there are fewer studies on the flavonoid component of CR,and in future studies, we should pay more attention to thiscomponent with multiple pharmacological effects.4.4 Lignans and their glycosidesLignans are defined as a class of natural products with a phenylpropane backbone formed by two structures linked by \u03b2, \u03b2\u00b4 or 8, 8\u00b4-carbons therein, usually referring to their dimers and, to a lesserextent, trimers and tetramers.Tangshenoside I-IV are exclusive components of CR, of whichtangshenoside I is about ten times more than the other threeglycosides (Mizutani et al., 1988). However, there are still fewreports on the pharmacological effects of Tangshenoside I. Thestructures of lignans are summarized in Supplementary Figure S4.In the following research, we should pay more attention to thisexclusive ingredient of CR, and expand the scope of itsmedical use.4.5 Steroids and their glycosidesSteroids are a naturally widespread class of chemicalcomponents, of which there are many types, but all havecyclopentano-perhydrophenanthrene in their structure. Thesteroids components of CR are sterols, steroidal glycosides andsteroids, and the structures of each component are shown inSupplementary Figure S5.4.6 Terpenes and their glycosidesTerpenes are the most abundant class of natural productswith a wide distribution, complex skeleton and a variety ofbiological activities. In addition, terpenes are compounds thathave an isoprene unit (C5) as the basic structural unit. Theterpene components isolated from CR mainly include tetra-and pentacyclic triterpenes, hemi- and sesquiterpenes, andthey mostly exist in the form of glycosides. The sesquiterpenelactone compounds atractylenolide II and atractylenolide IIIwere isolated for the first time from CR by Wang ZT et al.and reported for the first time in Campanulaceae (Wang et al.,1988). Atractylenolide III is one of the main components of CR,which has relatively obvious anti-inflammatory effect. Someresearchers believe that atractylenolide III can also be used asan index component in the quality evaluation of CR. In thissection, we systematically summarize the chemical compositionof CR and its structures are summarized in SupplementaryFigure S6.4.7 Organic acidsOrganic acids are compounds containing carboxyl groups(excluding amino acids) that are widely found in living things.The most common organic acids are carboxylic acids, whose acidityoriginates from the carboxyl group (-COOH). In addition, sulfonicacid (R-SO3H), sulfinic acid (RSOOH) and thiocarboxylic acid(RCOSH) are also organic acids. The organic acid composition inCR is summarized in Supplementary Figure S7.4.8 Volatile oilVolatile oil, also known as essential oil, is a generic term for aclass of oily droplets with an aromatic odor, which contains acomplex composition, usually consisting of tens to hundreds ofcomponents. Liao J et al. identified 32 components from thevolatile oil of CR, 11 acidic components, mainly brown shackleacid, and 21 neutral components (Liao and Lu, 1987); Li Conget al. used GC-MS coupling technique to isolate 66 componentsfrom the volatile components of CR, and identified 50 chemicalcomponents by Wiley and NBS standard spectral library search(Li et al., 1993); Guo QQ used steam distillation and headspacegas chromatography to extract volatile components of CR forGC-MS analysis, and 117 volatile compounds were detected(Guo, 2016). The volatile oil components of CR are mainlyalcohols, aldehydes, terpenes, ketones, furans, acids, olefins,alkanes, phenols, sulfides and other compounds. In this paper,we compiled 120 volatile oil components extracted from CR, asshown in Table 5.TABLE 4 (Continued) The main chemical constituents of CR.Type Compound Refcoronaric acid Xiao-qing Ma et al.

We havesystematically summarized the saccharides compounds of CR, themethods of extraction, separation and purification, monosaccharidecomposition and analysis method, as shown in Table 6.4.10 OthersIn addition to the above chemical constituents, other chemicalcompositions of CR are listed in Table 7, and the structures areshown in Supplementary Figure S8. In addition, CR contains manyamino acids, such as glutamic acid, glycine, tyrosine, serine andother 15 amino acids, as well as Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn and other33 inorganic elements. Among them, the content of nutrients andbeneficial elements (such as P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, etc.) required byhuman body is high, while the content of harmful elements (such asPb, Cd, AS, Hg, etc.) is low (Wang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2015).In this section, we provide a detailed summary of the chemicalconstituents obtained from the current extraction and isolation ofCR. Currently, more than 400 compounds are obtained from CR,including 120 volatile oil components. In addition, the traditionalmedicinal part of CR is the root, and the above-ground part is lessstudied, while the above-ground part contains a variety of chemicalcomponents with high utilization value, but its utilization andresearch are only in the primary stage, and the reasonable andeffective exploitation has not yet been carried out, resulting in aserious waste of resources. In the next research, we should studyother parts of CR, such as the leaves and stems of it, in order toenhance the utilization of non-traditional medicinal parts ofTABLE 5 (Continued) The volatile oil components of CR.NO.

With the development of modern technology,the instruments are also becoming more sensitive, precise andaccurate. In this paper, we have compiled the analytical methodsof CR in recent years in order to help scholars to better develop andutilize CR and establish quality control standards for CR. Phenol-sulfuric acid method is the main method for determination ofpolysaccharide content, scholars used UV-300 ultravioletspectrophotometer, 721 spectrophotometer and phenol-sulfuricacid colorimetric method to analyze the polysaccharides of CR(Wang et al., 1993). Analysis of total saponins of Codonopsis(TSC) and CPPs of CR by ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) by Dou et al. (2015); Dou et al. (2016). Zhen X et al. usedUV spectrophotometric method to determine CPPs of Lu Dangshenand other origins of CR and found that the average recovery was97.56%, and the average value of CPPs of CR was 18.39%, whichprovided the basis for the quality standard of Lu Dangshen (Zhenet al., 2014). The method is characterized by higher sensitivity, betteraccuracy, simple instrumentation, easy operation and faster analysis,but lacks selectivity for related substances with similar structures.The volatile oil components are often determined by gaschromatography, Guo analyzed the volatile components of CR byHead space gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS)to search for the main volatile components with special aroma in CR(Guo, 2016). The pretreatment of this method is simple and the costof the instrument is low, but it requires the substance to be measuredto have volatility. Therefore, this method has certain limitations andnarrow application scope.At present, the chemical constituents of CR are mostly studiedby HPLC, which provides reference for establishing the qualitystandard of CR. For example, some scholars use HPLC methodto analyze the content of lobetyolin in different origins (Song et al.,2008; Shi et al., 2011; Chen H. et al., 2014); Other scholars usedHPLC to simultaneously determine the contents of lobetyolin andsyringing in CR from different origins (Chen et al., 2016). Thismethod is featured with wide applicability, high separationefficiency, high automation and easy sample recovery. Themobile phase, however, is mostly toxic organic reagent, whichwill pollute the environment. There are also scholars whoevaluate the quality evaluation of Codonopsis Radix andprocessed products based on the analysis of monosaccharidesand oligosaccharides by liquid chromatography coupled withcharged aerosol detector, the method is independent of theoptical or structural characteristics of the sample and isresponsive to samples that do not contain chromophoric groups(Xie et al., 2022). With the enhancement of people\u2019s awareness ofenvironmental protection, supercritical fluid chromatography(UPC2) has come into the view of the majority of scholars. Ituses supercritical fluid as the mobile phase (supercritical CO2 isoften used), which has the advantages of both gas chromatographyand liquid chromatography, and can achieve rapid and effectiveseparation. Using the UPC2 method, Yang Liu et al. screened andquantified the quality markers of Angelica pubescens Maxim. f.biserrata Shan et Yuan [Apiaceae, Angelicae Pubescentis Radix],which is greener and safer compared to the traditionalchromatographic method (Yang et al., 2020). This can be used asa reference for relevant analytical work in future research on CR. Inaddition, the higher sensitivity and better accuracy ofchromatography-mass spectrometry tandem technique can alsoeffectively reduce the experimental cost. For example, somescholars have established UPLC-MS/MS method to determine thechemical composition of CR (Ma F.et al., 2014; An et al., 2018;Zheng et al., 2021). Compared with the traditional liquid phasemethod, this method has the advantages of high sensitivity, shortTABLE 7 Other components of CR.NO. Compounds Ref1 angelicin Zhu et al.

However, the instrumentation of the abovemethods is high-end and expensive. We believe that with thedevelopment of science and technology, more low-cost andefficient instruments as well as green reagents will be available,and in the near future, we can use more efficient, accurate and greenmethods for the research related to CR.5.2 Quality controlCR, a traditional Chinese medicine, has complex chemicalcomponents and wide drug sources. As a natural product ofmedicine and food, people\u2019s demand for CR is increasing day byday. However, there are many kinds of CR, and it is difficult todistinguish them. Moreover, fake and inferior products of CR areoften found in the Chinese herbal medicine market. In addition, thequality of Chinese medicinal materials is affected by geographicallocation, climatic environment, cultivation techniques and otheraspects. There are some differences in the quality of medicinalmaterials from different places of origin, and more importantly,the quality of medicinal materials from the same place of origin isunstable. Due to the above factors, currently, the quality and clinicalefficacy of CR cannot be effectively controlled. Therefore, it isnecessary for us to use modern science and technology toestablish quality control standards for the quality of CR and toevaluate its quality. In this paper, we have compiled literature onquality control of CR from a wide range of scholars in recent years,hoping that it can be helpful for the establishment of quality controlstandards for CR.Currently, the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia usesthin-layer chromatography to identify CR, and requires that themoisture content should not exceed 16.0%, the total ash contentshould not exceed 5.0%, and the sulfur dioxide residue should notexceed 400 mg/kg. Using the hot leaching method to determine,with 45% ethanol as the solvent, the leachate should not be lessthan 55.0%.However, there is no content determination item in ChinesePharmacopoeia, but only characterization and identification items.Chinese medicines are featured with multi-component and multi-target, etc. To establish a perfect quality standard research, it is alsonecessary to clarify the active ingredients or indicator componentsfor Chinese medicines to exert their medicinal effects. Ichikawa et al.simultaneously determined the contents of seven saponins in CR byLC-MS (Ichikawa et al., 2009); Chen J et al. measured the total ashand acid-insoluble ash and determined the content ofAtractylenolide III in CR by HPLC (Chen et al., 2012); Kim et al.used HPLC-UV to analyze tangshenoside \u2160, lobetyolin and lobetyolto establish the fingerprint profile of CR (Kim et al., 2014); Peng Ret al. used HPLC to measure the content of lobetyolin, colorimetricmethod to determine CPPs and TSC, atomic absorptionspectrometry to analyze the contents of As, Pb, Hg, Cd and Cuin CR, gas chromatography to determine BHC and DDT, and therest of the items were determined by referring to the methodincluded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The results showed thatthe content of lobetyolin was not less than 0.53 mg g\u22121, CPPs was notless than 14.7%, and the TSC was not less than 7.3 mg g\u22121 (Penget al., 2014).In addition, the chemical components of traditional Chinesemedicine are complex and diverse, and the therapeutic effect isthrough the whole of multiple components and multiple targets.The components of CR are diverse and have differentpharmacological effects. CPPs has the function of enhancingimmunity, Atractylenolide III has the effect of anti-inflammation, and lobetyolin has anti-gastric ulcerpharmacological activity. Therefore, there are certain limitationsin applying a single component as a quality control standard toeffectively keep the quality of CR. The complex and diversechemical composition and the unclear pharmacologicalpathways are the key points and difficulties in the qualityevaluation of Chinese medicine. More methods should be builton activity-related or quality evaluation based on chemical activity,and the quality standard and evaluation system that can reflect thecore efficacy of CR should be worked out to ensure the scientific,rational and safe use of CR (Qi et al., 2022).6 Processing methodProcessing is a major feature of TCM medication and animportant part in improving clinical efficacy. According to theneeds of the disease, the original properties of the drug aretraded off through processing, so that the desired effect ishighlighted and other effects are diminished to better suit clinicaltreatment.6.1 Ancient processing researchThe CR has been involved in the mixing of Radix Ginseng forthousands of years. The name of Dangshen and its medicinalmethod were first recorded in the Qing Dynasty, with a shortmedicinal history. Further, when used as a medicine, rawCodonopsis Radix is commonly used, and has the effects ofreplenishing qi and promoting fluid production, which is mostlyused for the treatment of spleen and lung qi deficiency, fooddeficiency and fatigue, as well as qi and blood deficiency.Therefore, its ancient processing method is relatively simple andis occasionally recorded in ancient books.In terms of purification, the main method used is to \u201cremove thetip\u201d (Qing \u201cZhi Jin\u201d); \u201cBamboo knife scraping, violently dried\u201d(Qing dynasty, \u201cBen Cao Hai Li\u201d); Processing, have \u201cHoneybroiling\u201d (Qing dynasty, \u201cZhi Jin\u201d); Tonifying the lungs, steamingwith honey. (Qing Dynasty, \u201cDe Pei Ben Cao\u201d); Stir-baking with riceof CR, can cure diarrhea due to deficiency-cold of spleen (QingDynasty, \u201cShi Bing Lun\u201d) (Li et al., 1993; Chen and Fang, 2013). Inaddition to that above processing methods, there is also thecharacteristic processing method of CR of Menghe MedicalSchool, including Ginger Juice fried Codonopsis Radix, (MaPeizhi\u2019s medical case, \u9a6c\u57f9\u4e4b\u533b\u6848; He jiheng\u2019s medical case, \u8d3a\u5b63\u8861\u533b\u6848), Agastachis Herba fried Codonopsis Radix (Ma Peizhi\u2019smedical case), Aucklandia Radix fried Codonopsis Radix (DengXingbo\u2019s Clinical Medical Collection, \u9093\u661f\u4f2f\u4e34\u8bc1\u533b\u96c6) and so on(Lv et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2023).In conclusion, the ancient methods of purification of CR includeremoving the tip and bolting skin, and the methods of processingFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org18Dong et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1162036include honey-roasted CR, steaming with honey, and fried CRwith rice.6.2 Modern processing researchThe modern common processing methods of CR include friedCR with rice (Wang et al., 2020), honey-roasted CR (Tang et al.,2022), soil fried CR, fried CR with bran and CR processed with wine(Liu et al., 2006). The chemical composition changes andpharmacological effects before and after processing by differentprocessing methods are summarized in Table 8.Fried CR with rice is the most commonly used method ofprocessing CR, which is included in China Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition). After fried with rice, the smell is burnt andfragrant, which can enhance the effect of invigorating qi andinvigorating spleen. At present, the changes of lobetyolincontent after rice frying are inconsistent, which may be due todifferences in processing technology. Studies have shown that withthe increase of frying time, the content of lobetyolin increasesfirstly and then decreases (Wang M. et al., 2021). So far, theprocessing technology of CR has mostly continued the ancientmethod without specific process parameters, and still relies onempirical judgment and does not quantify indicators such asfirepower and temperature, which is not conducive to the large-scale processing and production of modern enterprises. Therefore,in the next study, the processing standard of CR should beestablished, and the factors affecting the quality of CR such asits processing materials, processing time and fire power should bedetailed and digitized, and the quality evaluation standard of CRshould be established to facilitate the rational clinical applicationof CR. In addition, the current research on the changes of chemicalcomposition of CR before and after concoction is only limited toCPPs, lobetyolin and volatile oil. Chinese medicines arecharacterized by multi-target and multi-component combinedeffects, so the study of only a few components is limited andunspecific. The study of the changes in chemical compositionbefore and after concoction should be more in-depth andcomprehensive.7 Pharmacological effectsModern pharmacological studies have shown that CR has theability to protect nerve cells (Luo et al., 2017), protectgastrointestinal mucosa and anti-ulcer (Cui et al., 1988), regulatebody immunity (Zhang et al., 2003), anti-tumor (Wu et al., 2016),improve hematopoietic function and protect cardiovascular (Li Q.et al., 2019), antibacterial and antiviral (Bai et al., 2015), anti-agingand antioxidant effects (Xu et al., 2006), which have been confirmedby many scholars. These pharmacological effects are summarized inTable 9 and are discussed in detail below.7.1 NeuroprotectionCPPs had a significant protective effect against sodiumthiosulfate injury in neural stem cells (Wu et al., 2008). Thestudy by Zhang Q et al. found that CPPs could activate PP2A toprevent AD-like tau protein hyperphosphorylation, which couldrescue neuronal loss and alleviate AD-like cognitive impairment(Zhang et al., 2018). Banqiao Badix Codonopsis Polysaccharide(BCP) could effectively improve cognitive dysfunction induced byelevated GSK-3\u03b2 activity in rats, and the possible mechanism wasrelated to the downregulation of GSK-3\u03b2 activity, which in turninhibited Tau protein hyperphosphorylation and promotedneuronal development, and had some preventive or delayingeffects on AD (Luo et al., 2017). Wan L et al. found that CPPsattenuate A\u03b2 pathology in APP/PS1 mice and that downregulationof BACE1 may be a potential mechanism which could serve as atherapeutic target to attenuate cognitive deficits in AD pathology(Wan et al., 2020). Hu Y R et al. suggest that CPPs protect PC12 cellsfrom A\u03b21-40-induced injury, indicating that these components of CRmay represent an early therapeutic option for AD patients (Hu et al.,2021). However, the therapeutic effect and mechanism of CPPs onearly AD model in vivo and in vitro still need further study. CPPsimproved memory consolidation impairment in mice induced bycycloheximide, and the mechanism was related to the upregulationof protein expression of CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway (Liu,2020).TABLE 8 The chemical composition changes before and after processing and pharmacological effects by different processing methods.ProcessingmethodsThe chemical composition changes beforeand after processingPharmacological effects RefFried CR with rice After fired with rice, the content of that alcohol-solubleextract of CR is obviously reduce; Volatile oil contentdecreased; Variation in the content of lobetyolin is uncertainThe rice processed CR helps enhance the efficacy of replenishingqi and invigorating spleenWang et al.(2020), Tie et al.(2021)Honey-roasted CR The total polysaccharide content of CR increase; The contentof codonopsis acetylide, atractylodes lactone III and theextract of polysaccharide were all reducedAfter honey processing, the function of moistening lung,relieving cough, tonifying the middle and replenishing qi isenhancedTang et al.

Li R L et al. discovered that the water extract of CR couldreduce gastric mucosal injury and pathological damage in rats withstress ulcers and increased the content of polyamines (spermidine)in gastric mucosa. And in a subsequent study, it was found that thecell migration-promoting effect of the flavonoid-extracted part ofCR was related to the influence of polyamine regulatory signalingpathways (Li et al., 2013; Li L. et al., 2014). Ma F L et al. showed thatthe CPPs had the effect of promoting small intestinal peristalsis inmice. Moreover, it could also promote the growth and improve thedigestive ability of rats (Ma X. et al., 2014). Zhao Xiaofang studiedthe significant alleviating and antagonistic effects of BCP on TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats, and significantly improved thedamage caused by UC on colonic mucosa; The mechanism oftherapeutic effect on UC may be through the activation of TLR4-NF-\u03baB pathway to regulate the secretion of cellular inflammatoryfactors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10) and inflammatory mediators (NO),and is also associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects(Zhao, 2016). Li J K et al. first reported that inulin-type fructan CP-Amay be a potential component in CR for the treatment of acutegastric ulcer. CP-A significantly increased SOD and GSH-Pxactivities in gastric tissues. Besides, MDA and NO content andMPO activity were decreased, and in a dose-dependent manner (p <0.05) (Li J. et al., 2017). However, this experiment is only based ontheory, lacking in vivo verification. In the future research, furtheranimal experiments are needed to verify its anti-ulcer effect. Meng Jfound that CR can intervene in aging as a whole and protect thegastrointestinal tract of aging mice, OC105243318, Fam132a, RORCand 1200016E24Rik genes may be potential targets for CR to protectthe aging gastrointestinal tract, and their interaction network mayplay an important role in CR protection of the aging gastrointestinaltract (Meng, 2021). Liu et al. revealed that TSC had a significantprotective effect on colonic mucosal injury in UC rats, and themechanism may be related to anti-lipid peroxidation, inhibition ofNF-\u03baB signaling pathway and thus regulation of inflammatoryfactor release (Liu et al., 2021).7.3 Regulate body immunityThemethanol extract of CR has effect in regulating macrophage-mediated immune response, and promote anti-inflammatoryactivity (Lee et al., 2007). Lu Dangshen Oral Liquid couldregulate immunosuppressed mice by promoting the developmentof immune organs, proliferation of immune cells and increasing thelevel of immune factors (Tianhui et al., 2019). CPPs enhanced theproliferation of rat splenic lymphocytes and their ability to secreteIL-2 and IL-4, and enhanced the proliferation and phagocytosis ofrat macrophages and their ability to secrete TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in vitro.In vivo animal experiments, CPPs can increase the spleen index andthymus index of immunocompromised rats, and increase the levelsof IgG, IgM, IgA, C3 and C4. Its molecular mechanism may berelated to the inhibition of the expression of Bax and NF-\u03baBp-p65 proteins in immune organs, and the promotion of theexpression of Bcl-2 protein in immune organs (Xu, 2018). BAI RB et al. studied that Codonopsis pilosula oligosaccharide (CPO), CPOcould increase immune organ index, phagocytic index andimmunoglobulin content, stimulate the proliferation of spleniclymphocytes (in synergy with ConA and LPS), enhance earswelling in DTH response, promote the production of NO andcytokines (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3), and upregulate the expression ofcorresponding mRNA (Bai et al., 2020). This study is the first toshow that the quality of Codonopsis pilosula is related to its sweetcomponent, oligosaccharides. However, although the sugar contentof CPO up to 92.7%, it is still a mixture of glycans, and its specificactive ingredients need to be verified. SUN Q L et al. showed thatRCAP-1 and RCAP-2 had a significant immune stimulating effecton NO production by RAW264.7 macrophages (Sun et al., 2019).7.4 Anti-tumorCodonoposide 1c is a potent apoptosis inducer that inducesapoptosis in HL-60 cells (Lee et al., 2005). The saponins ofCodonopsis could inhibit the proliferation of humanhepatocellular carcinoma HepG-2 and SMMC-7721 cells. (Li,2012; Fang et al., 2015).The water-soluble polysaccharides CPP1aand CPP1c induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells by upregulating theBax/Bcl-2 ratio and activating caspase-3. In addition, it is cytotoxicto cervical cancer Hela cells and gastric cancer MKN45 cells. (Baiet al., 2018). Pectic polysaccharide CPP1b is significantly cytotoxicto human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Chen W. et al., 2014). More importantly, CRcould exert anti-gastric precancerous effects by ameliorating gastritisdamage and selectively inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancercells but not normal cells (He W. et al., 2022). CPW1 stabilizedSeNPs are selectively tumorigenic to Huh-7 and HepG2 cells withstrong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities, but do notinhibit the viability of human normal cells (Hu et al., 2022).Lobetyolin and lobetyol are the main active anti-tumorcomponents of Codonopsis lanceolata, Codonopsis lanceolataPolyacetylenes induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells andameliorates lung dysfunction by inactivating the Ras/PI3K/AKTpathway (Wang et al., 2022). CPPs inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferationand induce apoptosis through downregulation of CCHE1 expression(He R. et al., 2022).7.5 Improve hematopoietic function andprotect cardiovascularCR attenuates insulin-like growth factor II receptor pathwaydamage in cardiomyocytes and reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis(Tsai et al., 2013). CR restored LV systolic pressure (LVSP) andmaximum rate of intraventricular pressure change (\u00b1dp/dtmax) tovarying degrees (R < 0.01), reduced LV end-diastolic pressure(LVEDP) (R < 0.01), inhibited the elevation of MDA, LDH andCK, and enhanced SOD, GSH-Px, Na+, K+-ATP and Ca2+-ATPactivity (Ling, 2012). CR intervention improves cardiac systolic anddiastolic function to varying degrees, increases peak calciumtransients and shortens fallback time (Qun et al., 2017). CPPscan retard X-ray-induced hematopoietic stem cell senescence,and its mechanism of action may be related to p53-p21 signalingpathway, Bax and Bcl-2 apoptosis pathway (Li Y. et al., 2017). Thealcoholic extract of CR and potentially active compounds canpromote the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, maintainFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org24Dong et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1162036the stemness of hematopoietic stem cells, and thus performhematopoietic improvement functions (Gao, 2020). The extractof CR can promote the cardiogenic differentiation of embryonicstem cells and improve the cardiac function of infarcted heart(Wang J.-N. et al., 2021). Codonopsis lanceolata can significantlyincrease SOD activity, improve myocardial antioxidant level andreduce MDA expression, while significantly reducing the expressionof sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 in rat cardiomyocytes, withcertain myocardial protective effects (Zhang Y. et al., 2021).7.6 Antibacterial and antiviral effectThe ethanolic extract of CR had certain antibacterial effect,while the crude polysaccharide of CR had no obvious antibacterialeffect, and only had some antibacterial activity against Salmonella(Bai et al., 2015). In addition, it has been found that the alcoholicextract of CR has not only inhibited Bacillus catharticus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus hemolyticus type Aand B, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but also hasinhibited B. anthracis and Salmonella typhi (Duan et al., 2012).Phosphorylated Codonopsis pilosula polysaccharide reducesthe amount of DHAV and has stronger anti-DHAV activitythan CPPs (Ming et al., 2017). In addition, studies have alsofound that BCP has a good preventive effect against BVDV virus(Xuan, 2019).7.7 Anti-aging and antioxidant effectsIt has been found that the water extract of CR can delay aging byantioxidant, but not with the activity of antioxidant enzymes SODand CAT (Wu, 2021). Moreover, Lu-dangshen has the effect of anti-skin photoaging, and one of the possible mechanisms is that Lu-dangshen can reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in skintissue of photoaging mice, and directly or indirectly reduce the effectof inflammatory factors and their receptors on the genes andproteins related to MAPK and PI3K signal transductionpathways (Wang, 2020). There are scholars who have used anetwork pharmacology approach and found that the antioxidantstress effects of lobetyolin, L-tryptophan, and syringin may actthrough total antioxidant enzymes and the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway(Liao, 2022). However, this experiment does not have data tosupport its results, which can be discussed in depth by scholars next.7.8 OthersIn addition to the above-mentioned pharmacological effects, CRalso has a wide range of pharmacological activities in anti-stress(Hou et al., 2013), anti-inflammatory (Zhang J. et al., 2021),antifatigue (Yi et al., 2021) and antihypoxia (Yan et al., 2006; Xieet al., 2020a; Xie et al., 2020b).In conclusion, there are many common problems in the currentresearch on the pharmacological effects of CR, such as the lack ofcontrolled studies between positive drugs and CR, unclear activecomponents in related pharmacological effects and insufficientresearch on the mechanism of related pharmacological effects.First of all, currently, the research on CR and its extract has awide research prospect. But the extract is complex and itsmechanism is difficult to elucidate. Therefore, it is necessary forus to further study the monomer compounds of TCM. However, upto now, studies on the pharmacological activity of CR mainly focuson CPPs, lobetyolin and TSC. The possible reason is that the othercomponents in CR are lower and the efficacy is not obvious.Consequently, the current understanding of the active ingredientsin CR is relatively limited. Therefore, scholars can use moresophisticated instrumentation methods to investigate the othercomponents in CR.Second, although we have made some progress in our currentresearch on the pharmacological effects of CR, we still have a longway to go, such as the lack of research on the optimal extractionprocess of polysaccharide compounds in CR and the lack of researchon the optimal effective dose of CR immunomodulation. Moreover,it is difficult to have an accurate indicator of clinical dosage due tothe different content of polysaccharides extracted by differentmethods. Thus, it is necessary to establish a unified standard forthe extraction of polysaccharide compounds in CR for better clinicalapplication.Third, Cao H F found that total saponins of Codonopsis pilosulananoemulsion could enhance the regulation of cellular, humoral andnon-specific immunity by TSC (Cao and Wang, 2019). In thefollowing research, scholars may also consider developingcheaper, environmentally friendly, safe, and effective materials toreplace the traditional codonopsis preparations, and developingmore new dosage forms of Chinese medicine for clinical application.Fourth, TCM has natural advantages that synthetic drugs do nothave the anticancer activity of CR has been demonstrated inprevious studies. But there is no doubt that the inclusion of CRin the list of anticancer drugs still requires a great deal of research. Inthe next step, it is necessary to establish suitable models to determinethe mechanism of action, safety and dose range, as well as to performhistological and immunohistochemical assays. Besides, theantimicrobial activity of Chinese herbs, which are of wideinterest because of their high efficiency, low toxicity and green.However, due to the complexity of the active ingredients of CR, theabove experiments were performed only for preliminaryantibacterial tests on CR extracts. Further research and studiesare needed to investigate the components of the extract that haveantibacterial activity and their antibacterial mechanisms.Last but not least, Flavonoids from CCS have obviousantioxidant and anti-fatigue pharmacological effects (Wang et al.,2012). This also reminds us to strengthen research on non-traditional drug parts and local commonly used products, expanddrug sources, and make rational use of drug resources. For example,the development of stems and leaves and local common productsinto health products or food additives can not only reduce the wasteof resources but also extend the industrial chain of CR products,which has important ecological and practical significance.In a word, we have systematically summarized thepharmacological effects of CR and provided a reference for itsdevelopment and utilization for future studies. In subsequentstudies, researchers can use this as a basis for in-depth studies on CR.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org25Dong et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.11620368 ToxicityThe Chinese botanical drug CR has a complex and diversecomposition and can be used for both qi and fluid injuries or qi andblood deficiencies. Moreover, it is necessary for us to study thetoxicity of CR in depth to provide a scientific basis for the rationalclinical use of CR. In this paper, we reviewed the literature relatedto the toxicity of CR that we could collect so far, and the resultsshowed that CR has no significant toxic side effects and a widerange of safety. Cheng J L et al. conducted an acute toxicity test onSPF grade KM mice with broken wall powder of CR, and no acutetoxic reactions were observed in mice (Cheng et al., 2011). Scholarsstudied the acute toxicity of CPPs on ordinary-grade mice. Themice were oral administered with the maximum concentration ofCPPs 0.5 g/mL (20 g/kg) for three times a day. There was noadverse effect on the body weight, activity, food intake, andexternal signs of the mice. All the mice survived in good health7 days after administration (Feng and Gao, 2012). WU J L et al.conducted an acute toxicity test on mice with CPPs and adoptedthe methods of intravenous administration, intraperitonealadministration and gavage administration, respectively, andobtained the result of low toxicity of CPPs by continuousobservation for 2 weeks (Wu et al., 2016); Hou L L et al.conducted a long-term toxicity test on rats with the oralsolution of CPPs. No significant toxic effects were observed byanalyzing hematology, blood biochemistry, weight, and organhistopathology sections of rats (Hou et al., 2016). There are alsoresearchers conducted acute oral toxicity test, genetic toxicity testand subchronic toxicity test on ICR mice and SD rats with theextract of CR, and the results showed no significant toxicity.Moreover, no harmful effect was observed at the dose of8.0 g/kg BW (equivalent to 16.0 g/kg BW of CR), which met therequirements of National food safety standards (Hu Z. et al., 2018).Xu X H et al. showed no significant toxic effects in the acute oraltoxicity test, three genotoxicity tests (bacterial revertant mutationtest, mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test and mousespermatocyte chromosome aberration test) and subchronictoxicity test on Wen Dang and Baitiao Dang (Xu et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2022).In conclusion, there is no acute toxicity, subchronic toxicity,genotoxicity or long-term toxicity in CR and its extracts, and CR hasa wide range of safety. Thus, CR has a high edible safety and theefficacy of tonifying the middle and replenishing qi. While worryingabout \u201cThe medicine has side effects\u201d, we cannot ignore the dual-useof some Chinese medicines as both food and medicine. Currently,CR has been included in the National List of Food and DrugSubstances in Japan, Singapore and other countries. On April 24,2018, the National Health and Wellness Commission of Chinaissued the letter on soliciting opinions on the administration ofusing 9 substances such as CR as substances that are traditionallyconsidered as both food and Chinese medicinal materials (nationalhealth office food letter [2018] No.278), clarifying the legal status ofCR as food. At present, CR is not included in the list of medicinaland food products. Therefore, in the future, a large number ofanimal and clinical experiments should be conducted to verify itssafety, so that it can be better used as a medicinal and food productfor clinical treatment and healthcare, and to provide information forthe development and utilization of CR in the food field.9 PharmacokineticsCurrently, there are few reports on the pharmacokinetics of CRextract and its main active components. DOU X et al. et al.demonstrated that the micronization of CR could promote theabsorption and bioavailability of lobetyolin in rats (Xia et al.,2016). However, the main active ingredients of CR include CPPsbesides lobetyolin. In order to clarify the advantages of ultramicro-powder more scientifically and comprehensively, it is necessary tocontinue to study the pharmacokinetics of CPPs in vivo. Dong J Jet al. established the UPLC method for the determination oflobeyolin in rat plasma and found that, lobeyolin is poorlyabsorbed or widely metabolized in rats, and there are interactionsamong the components of CR extract, which leads to differences inpharmacokinetics between lobeyolin and CR extract. The reasonsfor the low bioavailability of lobetyolin and the methods to improveits oral absorption need to be further studied, so as to providereference for its preparation (Dong et al., 2021). The concentrationof inulin-type fructan CPA in CR was detected by fluorescentlabeling method, and the in vivo process of CPA was analyzed. Itwas found that FCPA could be absorbed through blood circulationafter oral administration, with low bioavailability, and its tissuedistribution was wide, with long T1/2 and MRT (Guo et al., 2022).Scholars used UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS andUHPLC-MS/MSmethods toanalyze the metabolic pathways of three polyacetylene compoundsfrom CR: lobetyol, lobetyolin, and lobetyolinin in vivo and in vitro(Xie et al., 2023).However, at present, there are few studies on pharmacokineticsof CR, and little is known about how the active ingredients of CR areabsorbed from outside to inside, how they are distributed,metabolized and excreted in the body. The complexity ofingredients, uncertainty of effective ingredients and diversity ofanalogues of traditional Chinese medicine make it difficult todevelop pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicine.Therefore, we need to strengthen the work in this area, combinethe exploration of pharmacokinetics with the theoretical explorationof TCM, and strengthen the study of metabolites kinetics.10 Conclusion and prospectChinese medicine is a natural product that has advantages notfound in synthetic drugs. CR, as one of the traditional Chinesemedicines, can be used as both medicine and food. In this paper, thecompounds extracted and separated from CR and their structuralformulas were summarized systematically, which had certainreference value. Moreover, in the pharmacological section, wehave summarized in detail its neuroprotective effects, protectionof gastrointestinal mucosa and anti-ulcer, regulation of bodyimmunity, anti-tumor, endocrine regulation, improvement ofhematopoietic function, cardiovascular protection, anti-aging andantioxidant effects, which can provide reference for the next studies.Such an in-depth and comprehensive summary has never been seenin the previous literature on CR. In addition, in this review, we alsodiscuss in depth the inadequacies in the existing studies on CR, andpresent our own views and solutions.First, the chemical composition, especially the material basisof the medicinal effect of CR and its constitutive relationshipFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org26Dong et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1162036should be studied in depth. In addition, non-traditionalmedicinal parts of CR, such as stems and leaves, also containa variety of chemical components. However, relatively littleresearch has been conducted on it. In the next step, theresearch on non-traditional medicinal parts of CR should bestrengthened to make full use of herbal resources and avoidwaste. More importantly, there are many varieties of CR. Asmentioned above, the local products, Codonopsis clematidea, hasstronger anti-free radical ability than Lu Dangshen, but it is stillless exploited. Besides, in addition to traditional Chinesemedicine, Dangshen is also widely used in Mongolianmedicine and Tibetan doctor. For example, Weihe granule IIhas good effect on chronic gastritis (Li L. et al., 2014); Ganshengranules is used for deficiency of both qi and blood, dizziness,insomnia, fatigue and soreness of waist and legs (Cheng et al.,2019); ShanHuQiShiWei Pill are mainly used for cerebralthrombosis, coronary heart disease, epilepsy and variousneuritis; Eighteen Flavor Dangshen Pills in the treatment ofPyocutaneous Disease, diminishing inflammation and relievingpainand (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, our research on Codonopsisshould not be limited to traditional Chinese medicine, but alsocombined with Mongolian medicine, Tibetan medicine andother clinical applications of Codonopsis, in order to facilitatea more comprehensive development and utilization ofCodonopsis. In the future, we should strengthen the researchon local products and establish a number of breeding bases in theconcentrated distribution areas of medicinal wild resources,such as Xinjiang, Tibet and Sichuan, for artificial introductionand cultivation, so as to better develop and utilize the medicinalresources of CR.Second, as a traditional Chinese medicine commonly used inChina, CR has the characteristics of multi-component and multi-target combined effect. Currently, the indexes of quality evaluationof CR are only limited to CPPs, Atractylenolide III and lobetyolin,which still have certain shortcomings. Whether the qualityevaluation of several components can represent the overallclinical efficacy of CR remains to be studied in depth. Inaddition, CPPs is the main active component of CR. However,polysaccharides are a series of components, and the precise isolationand preparation of polysaccharides are still difficult, the mechanismof pharmacological effect still needs to be studied in depth, and it isstill challenging to obtain polysaccharide components that canrepresent the characteristics of CR. We need to establishscientific and reasonable quality control standards to contributeto the safe and rational use of CR. In the future, scholars can use low-cost and environmentally friendly UPLC-QDA and UPC2 methodsto screen quality markers by spectral-effect relationships or networkpharmacology.Thirdly, most of the processing methods of CR have beenextended to the ancient methods without specific processparameters, which is not conducive to mass industrialproduction. In addition, the different processing methods haddifferent effects on the content of the components in CR.Therefore, in the next study, scholars should focus onestablishing a unified and scientific process standard, quantifyingand specifying the processing ingredients, temperature, time andother factors that he would affect the quality of the product of CR.Fourthly, CR is a natural medicine that can be used as bothfood and medicine, with low toxicity and high edibility. However,CR is not listed in the table of contents of homology of medicineand food in China. In subsequent studies, it is necessary toestablish more animal and clinical trials to verify its safety. Inaddition, researchers should strive to develop more edible productsusing CR so that it can be better used as a health product in thedaily life of people.In conclusion, this paper reviews the research results on thebotany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, analysis method andquality control, processing methods, pharmacological effects,pharmacokinetics and toxicity of CR in recent years, and putsforward some opinions and suggestions to provide new ideas forfurther development of the plant resources of CR.Author contributionsJD, AH, and SZ conceived of and designed the review; YN,HY, and SZ searched the literature and downloaded thedocuments and made classification; YN wrote the paper; LYand WL provided a holistic idea, checking the chemicalstructures and formula and contributed comments for versionof the manuscript.
