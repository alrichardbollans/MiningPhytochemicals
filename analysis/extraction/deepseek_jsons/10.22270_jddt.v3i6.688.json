HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE K. reticulata has been indexes in majority of published phytochemical, pharmacological and traditionally uses reviews and research articles till date with different named. In Poiret, 1804 is described this species based on a collection made by an unknown collector in tropical Asia and deposited in Lamarck herbarium in Paris. Although Poiret\u201fs protologue mentions that species grew \u201cdans les Indes\u201d the sheet no locality information and it is therefore unclear from where and from whom Lamarck received this plant. Given that the collection must have been made before 180430-32. It is one of largest genera of the euphorbiaceae. It contains compounds known to be biologically active33.In 1985, scientific research has identified within the genus potential sources of agents against cancer34and hepatitis B virus35-37. The objective of this review is to organize taxonomically all such citations as could be found. Ethnobotanical surveys were carried out in Bukoba Rural District to explore the traditional ethno-medical knowledge, the use and conservation of medicinal plants in the management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections and to determine whether levels of harvesting are sustainable. The district is currently an epicentre of HIV/AIDS and although over 90% of the population in the district relies on traditional medicines to manage the disease, this traditional knowledge still remains largely unknown. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a major public health problem in many countries particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence in sub-Saharan Africa, traditional healers HIV/AIDS patients38. The traditional healers play a crucial role of providing primary health care by taking care of people living with HIV/ AIDS39,40. In 2006, almost two thirds (63%) of all persons infected with HIV/ AIDS in the world were living in sub-Saharan Africa41. Tanzania as it affects mostly the young and most economically productive population42. HIV/AIDS are susceptible to fungal and bacterial opportunistic infections that result from immunosuppression43.It is one of the leading causes of deaths in Tanzania and worldwide44. The use of plants as (K. reticulata) medicine is common to many cultures, and a number of advanced pharmaceutical drugs were derived from plants45. Tanzania depends on traditional medicines for the management of various diseases including HIV/AIDS46. In Rural area of Tanzania especially in bukoba district, suffer from HIV/AIDS47. Many plants species is using in HIV/AIDS diseases but one of most plant is K. reticulata used in treating various disease related to HIV/AIDS in Bukoba rural district, Tanzania. The leaves part of K. reticulata used in treated of chronic cough chronic diarrhoea, cryptococcal meningitis, Herper zoster, oral candidiasis, oral sores, skin infections, skin rashes, tuberculosis48. Some importent medicinal uses of K. reticulata species in differents countries worldwide such as Africa, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Pakistan, Indochina, Philippines, Malay Peninsula, Australia, India and Sri Lanka respectively. Many diseases and traditional uses. 4. VERNACULAR NAME AND TRADITIONAL USES In Table No. 1. & Table No. 2.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY In worldwide, the plant was reported for various ethnopharmacological activities such as tumor-promoting activity found (Hecker, personal communcitation);101 hypotensive activity102antifungal and in vitro Hypotensive activity67,10,103 etc. These are described as following: 6.1. Antidiabetic activity, Anti- hyperglycaemic And hypoglycaemic activities The plant K. reticulata is claimed to have antidiabetic activity in tribal area. To validate the tribal claim, the petroleum ether and ethanolic extracts of leaves of the K. reticulata were orally tested at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for hypoglycaemic effect in alloxan induces diabetic mice. It shows antidiabetic activity at the dose of 1000mg/kg. The phytochemical screening of the residues revealed the presence of terpenoids glycosides, protein, carbohydrates and absence of alkaloids and steroids83,105,106. 6.2. Antibacterial activities The in vitro antibacterial activities of leaf extract (Methanol and Ethanol) from 10 genus species. Which are medicinally important, were investigated by agar-well diffusion method against four food borne human pathogens (Staphylococccus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Leaf extracts contained high level of phenols and exhibit differential antibacterial Soni et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics; 2013, 3(6), 168-184 179 \u00a9 2011, JDDT. All Rights Reserved ISSN: 2250-1177 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO activity against all four tested human pathogenic bacteria. The phenolic constituents of the tested extracts are closely associated with antibacterial activity. Highest antibacterial activity is exhibited by K. reticulata and can be used as a promising source of antibacterial drug107, methanol, chloroform and hexane extracts from leaves of K. reticulata, used in Indian ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of several ailments of microbial and non-microbial origin were evaluated for potential antibacterial activity against methicillin- isolated from clinical specimen was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibacterial activity and biofilm production of crude extracts against MRSA (ATCC 25923) values of the methanol, chloroform and hexane extracts were in the range of 12.5 to 50.0 mg/ml and 25.0 to 100.0 mg/ml, respectively. Amongst the evaluated extracts, the methanolic extract showed the strongest antibacterial effect as well as biofilm inhibition. Micro plate screening used for detection of biofilm formation by Staphylococci is a quantitative model to study its adherence level and has been a sensitive method108. and the in vitro antibacterial activity of crude methanolic, chloroform and hexane extracts of the leaves of K. reticulata were investigated. Susceptibility of some Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive organism (Staphylococcus aureus) were tested. Agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum antibacterial activity against all the tested microorganisms. The extracts exhibited antibacterial activities with zones of inhibition ranging from 9.07-30.10 mm, 8.17-24.57 mm and 5.60-14.67 mm for methanol, chloroform and hexane extracts respectively. Screening of crude extracts showed notable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at concentrations of 100 to 6.25 mgml-1. The organisms were more sensitive to the methanolic extract of the leaves, where as extracts from other solvents like chloroform and hexane showed moderate to weak activity respectively. Similar results have been showed in MIC and MBC16. 6.3. Antioxidants activities and Free radical scavenging Antioxidant activity of entire plant of K. reticulata by performing different in vitro antioxidant assays, including 2,2-Diphenyl-1- Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, beta-carotene bleaching, superoxide anion radical scavenging, reducing power and metal chelating assay at different concentrations (100, 200 and 400\u00b5g/ml). The entire plant powder of K. reticulata shows good antioxidant activity of about 90.0% when compared with standard butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) (85%) at a concentration of 400\u00b5g/ml. Results obtained reveal that methanolic extracts of entire plant of K. reticulata tapossess higher antioxidant activity when compared when compared with ethanolic extract. Thus, this study suggests that K. reticulata plantcan be used as a potent source of nature antioxidants109, Free radicals are implicated for many diseases including Diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cancer, ageing. etc. In treatment of these diseases, antioxidant therapy has gained utmost importance. K. reticulata popularly important medicinal plant. Keeping in view of the cited activity, it is contemplated to screen the plant for in vitro antioxidant activity using different models viz. DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS radical scavenging, iron chelating activity and lipid peroxidation assay, nitric oxide scavenging assay, alkaline DMSO assay, total antioxidant capacity and non- enzymatic haemoglobin glycosylation assay . The results were analyzed statistically by regression method. Its antioxidant activity was estimated by IC50 value and the values are 20.36 \u03bcgm/ml (DPPH radical scavenging), 42.59 \u03bcgm/ml (ABTS radical scavenging), 32 \u03bcgm/ml (Iron chelating activity) and 41.91 \u03bcgm/ml (lipid peroxidation), 122.8 \u03bcgm/ml (nitric oxide scavenging) and 2.57 \u03bcgm/ml (alkaline DMSO). In total antioxidant capacity assay, 1 mg of extract is equivalent to 51 \u03bcg of ascorbic acid. It showed 66.64% inhibition of haemoglobin glycosylation. In all the testing, a significant correlation existed between concentrations of the extract and percentage inhibition of free radicals, metal chelation or inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant property may be related to the polyphenols and flavonoids present in the extract. These results clearly indicate that K. reticulata is effective against free radical mediated diseases110, antioxidant properties of the medicinal plant K. reticulata. The different solvent extracts of K. reticulata leaves were screened for their in vitro phytochemical and antioxidant activity. Leaves were extracted with solvents of different polarities like aqueous, ethanol, methanol, chloroform, acetone and hexane. The distributions of the main active principles such as alkaloid, flavonoids, phenols, steroids tannins etc. present in the plant were analyzed. It was also focused to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid content present in the extracts. Extracts showed promising results for total antioxidant capacity and reductive capability when compared with standard drug. The ethanol extract was found to possess excellent phytochemical and antioxidant activities. The antioxidant property may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids and phenolics present in the drug. The ability of the crude extracts of K. reticulata towards reduction, presence of phenol, flavonoid and antioxidant is an indication of its broad spectrum potential which may be employed in the management of various diseases72. Many plants possess antioxidant ingredients that provided efficacy by additive or synergistic activities. Antioxidant activity of the methanol crude extract of entire plant of K. reticulata was assessed using DPPH, superoxide anion and metal chelating assays at different concentrations. The potent extract of K. reticulata was tested for in vivo efficacy. The methanol extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity compared to known antioxidant. In vivo studies on potent extract of K. reticulata demonstrated dose dependent reduction in hepatic malondialdehyde (330.70, 279.40 and383.79\u03bcMmg-1 protein) with simultaneous improvement in hepatic glutathione (7.03, 18.16 and 6.88\u03bcgmg-1 protein) and catalase levels (678.10, 787.00 and 522.00\u03bcgmg-1 protein) respectively for 50, 100mgkg-1 dose and control) compared to control group. Due to its natural origin and potent free radical scavenging ability K. reticulata could be used as a potential preventive intervention for free radical mediated diseases111. 6.4. Antiplasmodial activity Antiplasmodial of K. reticulata medicinal plants were extracted and tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity Soni et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics; 2013, 3(6), 168-184 180 \u00a9 2011, JDDT. All Rights Reserved ISSN: 2250-1177 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO against chloroquine- sensitive (K67) and chloroquine-resistant (ENT36) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Out of 16 extracts, 12 were active against ENT36 strain while seven were active against K67 strain, that is, IC50 < or = 50 micrograms/ml. The most active extracts on both strains were those of leaves of K. reticulata with IC50 < or = 10 micrograms/ml. The stembark of Terminalia spinosa Engl. (Combretaceae) and the stems of Dissotis brazzae Cogn. (Melastomataceae) had IC50 < or = 10 micrograms/ml for strains K67 and ENT36, respectively. A phytochemical analysis of these plants revealed the presence of different classes of primary and secondary metabolites82. 6.5. Antinociceptive activity K. reticulata is used in folk medicinal practices of Bangladesh as an antinociceptive (reducing sensitivity to painful stimuli). The study was to investigate the antinociceptive activity of methanolic leaf extract of K. reticulata in Swiss albino mice. A model of acetic acid-induced gastric pain in mice was utilized to determine the antinociceptive effects. In writhing assays induced by acetic acid, the methanolic leaf extract showed significant inhibition compared to control. The maximum writhing inhibition (39.1%) was found at a dose of 200 mg extract/kg body -weight which, however, was lesser than that of the antinociceptive drug, aspirin (50.4%), when used at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Maximum tolerance (35.0%) was showed at 400 mg extract/kg body weight, compared to that of the standard drug, glibenclamide at 10 mg/kg body weight (57.8%). The methanol extract of K. reticulata leaves had beneficial effects as a pain reliever which validates the use of the plant in Bangladesh folk medicinal practices as a treatment for pain106. 6.6. Analgesic activity The petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of K. reticulata were chosen for pharmacological screening. In the acetic acid-induced writhing test, the ethyl acetate extract in doses of 150 and 300 mg=kg showed 51.23 and 65.12% inhibition of writhing, respectively. A significant elongation of tail-flick time was evident both in the ethyl acetate and the methanol extracts (42.38 and 60.49%) only at the 300 mg=kg dose level. The extracts of K. reticulata possess significant shows analgesic properties112. 6.7. Antiviral activity K. reticulata is a reputed medicinal plant used in Bangladesh and India for the treatment of gastric complaints including colic, constipation etc. The study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of this plant against hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HBsAg positive serum sample from hepatitis B virus infected patients. Two semi-purified organic fractions designated as PR1 and PR2 of the fat free ethanolic extract were tested at both lower and higher concentrations (20 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml respectively) for their anti hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) activity using an in vitro system by Reverse Passive Haemagglutination (R-PHA) method. SERRODIA-Anti-HBsAg- Diagnostic kit was used for detection of Anti-HBsAg antibody. Both fractions showed anti-HBsAg activity. But it was found the fractions have little inhibitory action on HBsAg at lower concentration whereas at the higher concentration they have prominent inhibitory action on the antigen. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the antiviral activity of K. reticulata against HBV. The Anti-HBsAg. activity observed by the fractions may be due to the binding of the agents with the antibody binding sites present on HBsAg. Thus the fractions might be the potential sources of the active principles responsible for antiviral activity53. 6.8. Anti-inflammetry activities To study pharmacognostic evaluation and anti - inflammatory activity of K. reticulata fruit. The hydroalcoholic extract of ripe fruits and petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanolic extracts of aerial parts was also screened for anti-inflammatory activity by carrageenan induced left hind paw oedema in rat at doses of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, orally112,113. 6.9. Insectisidal activities Chemical constituents as well as insecticidal activity of the crude methanol extract from the leaves of K. reticulata. Were investigated. (5R*,6R*)-4, Dimethoxycarbonyl-5-[2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihydroxy-6\u2032-(methoxycarbonyl) phenyl]-5,6-dihydro-2H pyran-2-one along with 3,4,3\u2032-tri-Omethylellagic acid, and methyl gallate were isolated from the dichloromethane extract. Determination of their structures was based on spectroscopic analysis. Compound 1 possessed a very weak insecticidal activity against Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) with an IC50 value of 27.27 \u03bcg/mL77. 6.10. Hepatoprotective activity Two partially purified organic fractions designated by PR1 and PR2 of the fat free ethanol (95%) extract of aerial parts of K. reticulata were tested for the hepatoprotective activity in rats against CCl4-induced liver damage. The rats receiving the fractions showed promising hepatoprotective activity as evident from significant changes of pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, changes in serum levels of sGPT, sGOT, sALP and bilirubin and also from histopathological changes as compared to CCl4-intoxicated rats84. 6.11. Toxicity The hexane and methanol extracts of K. reticulata leaves were inactive in the in vitro cytotoxicity study. The dichloromethane extract showed IC50 values of 11.89 \u03bcg/mL in KB and 16.08 \u03bcg/mL in MCF7, but was inactive in the NCI-H187 human tumor cell line. The dichloromethane extract was then further purified using column chromatography, Two other compounds isolated from the dichloromethane extract were identified as 3,4,3\u2032-tri-Omethylellagic acid, and methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (methyl gallate) by the spectrometric methods77. CONCLUSION The scientific research on K. reticulata suggests a huge biological potential of this plant. It is strongly believed that detailed information as presented in this review on the phytochemical and various biological properties of the Soni et al Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics; 2013, 3(6), 168-184 181 \u00a9 2011, JDDT. All Rights Reserved ISSN: 2250-1177 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO plant might provide detailed evidence for the use of this plant in different diseases. It has various traditional uses that differ from one country to another whereas some important uses for the treatment of diabetes, dysentery, fever, gonorrhoea, syphilis and stomachache and skin diseases are almost common. K. reticulata, a potent herbal medicine is attracting researchers since many decades due to its high therapeutic value. There is a demand to standardize the properties of K. reticulata and their detailed clinical trials. Pharmacological and chemical studies have demonstrated that the extracts of the plant possess various pharmacological actions viz. antiviral, anti-inflammatory antimicrobial, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective and antioxidants, antihepatitis B, and antiplasmodial. Owing to the impressive precli-2H-nical therapeutic potential, the plant extracts have been evaluated in human trials for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, hypertension and diabetes. K. reticulata is reported to contain lignans, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpenes, sterols and alkaloids. The phytochemicals exhibited different structural characteristics with various pharmacological actions. The lignans glycosides isolated from K. reticulata significantly inhibited alloxon induced diabetic mice. The presence of high contents of phenolic compounds in the aqueous extract of P. reticulatus was found to have strong and significant antioxidant activity. Triterpenoids isolated from aqueous and methanolic extract of leaves, stem bark and root bark of K. reticulata exhibited very high antioxidant activity. Phytochemical and phytoanalytical information appears to be very useful and might lead to development of novel agents for various disorders and could be explored further for commercial purposes. However, there are many aspects, which need to be explored like well-controlled clinical trials using large sample size (large number of patients) for the efficacy and toxicity, the mechanism of biological activity of active constituents present in the plant. On the basis of biological activities of K. reticulata, crude extract and derived phytochemicals and their uses as pharmacological agents in traditional and modern research are possible but will first require more clinical trials and product development. The current evidence is large limited to correlation between identified phytochemicals and mode of action for any pharmacological activity. Mechanism of action studies are expected to lead the way in the discovery of new agents with improved and intriguing pharmacological properties. This could be achieved by molecular modeling studies involving interaction of bioactive phytochemicals from K. reticulata with their respective molecular targets and the extract of K. reticulata could be further explored in the future as a source of useful phytochemicals for the pharmaceutical industry.
