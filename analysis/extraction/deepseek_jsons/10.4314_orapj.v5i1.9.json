It is a major public health problem in many countries of inter-tropical Africa. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over a million people (2%) are affected by this hemoglobinopathy. Purpose This study aimed to scientifically validate the anti-sickle cell activity of aqueous extracts of S. occindentalis seeds and to identify the chemical constituents responsible for this activity. Methods In this study, we used S. occidentalis seeds harvested at Ilebo in Central Kasai Province, while the blood samples used were taken from sickle-cell patients. The phytochemical composition was determined according to the standard method described previously by Iteku et al. and Nkasa et al. The Emmel test was carried out according to the standard protocol described previously by Bongo et al. Results The results obtained in this study showed that the seeds of this plant are rich in secondary metabolites such as total polyphenols (flavonoids, anthocyanins, leuco-athocyanins, tannins, and saponins), di-terpenes, alkaloids, and bound quinones. However, these seeds do not contain triterpenoids and steroids. Total seed extracts from this plant showed significant anti-sickle cell activity. Conclusion This study identified a medicinal plant used by the sickle cell disease community.

(Fabaceae) INTRODUCTION Sickle cell disease is a hereditary genetic disease characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the deformation of the red blood cells and causing serious complications (Masengo et al., 2021; Bongo et al., 2017). It is the leading genetic disease in terms of the number of sufferers and represents a major public health problem in many countries of inter-tropical Africa. It affects more than 50 million people worldwide. It is estimated that more than 300,000 babies are born with this hemoglobinopathy every year (Gbolo et al., 2023; Gulbis et al., 2005). In the Democratic Republic of Congo, over a million people (2%) are affected by this hemoglobinopathy (Gbolo et al., 2023; Mpiana et al., 2007). Several therapeutic actions have been developed to combat sickle cell disease. Gene therapy is being carried out on several samples. It offers a glimmer of hope but is not accessible to everyone. Blood transfusions are recommended in the event of a crisis. Polytransfusion slows down hemoglobin S synthesis, and reduces the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises and superinfections, but presents risks, including HIV, hepatitis, and blood incompatibilities. The administration of hydroxyurea, a molecule that increases fetal hemoglobin production and improves erythrocyte phenotype. It also has a disadvantage: toxicity occurs with prolonged use (Masengo et al., 2021). Attempts to alleviate the suffering of sickle cell sufferers include the use of medicinal plants (Inkoto et al., 2021; Panzu et al., 2020). However, the folkloric use of plant species has led scientists to carry out studies on plants cited in traditional medicine as being able to treat SS anemia. The aim is to validate and popularize these plants. Many of these studies have demonstrated anti sickle cell activity in vitro (Bongo et al., 2018; Tshilanda et al., 2016; Ngbolua et al., 2014; Kitadi et al., 2022; Kitadi et al., 2019; Mpiana et al., 2012; Ogoda et al., 2002). This research has revealed that the anti-sickle cell activity of these plants is due to the presence of active principles. The present study aims to assess the in vitro antifalcemic effect of S. occidentalis, a medicinal plant widely used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. To this end, we will formulate hypotheses to determine whether S. occidentalis extracts have beneficial effects on red blood cell deformation in individuals with sickle cell disease. In parallel, we will carry out an in-depth analysis of the plant's phytochemistry to identify the bioactive compounds potentially responsible for the observed antifalcemic activity. This study aims to scientifically validate the anti-sickle cell activity of aqueous extracts of S. occindentalis seeds, as well as to identify the chemical constituents responsible for this activity. The results of this research could contribute to the development of promising new therapeutic approaches for the management of sickle cell disease, improving patients' quality of life and opening new prospects in the field of herbal medicine. METHODS Materials In this study, the S. occidentalis seeds used were harvested at Ilebo in the province of Kasa\u00ef centrale, while the blood was obtained from sickle cell patients seen in consultation at the Centre Mixte d'An\u00e9miemia SS, located at Yolo-Sud, in the commune of Kalamu, city-province of Kinshasa. To be included in the study, blood had to come from patients whose sickle cell status had been proven by the hemoglobin electrophoresis technique. This test was performed on freshly collected blood. The samples were stored in a refrigerator at plus or minus 4\u00b0C. But before storage, it should be noted that to 1.6 mL of SS blood, 0.4 mL of 0.14 sodium citrate solution was added as an anticoagulant. Methods Chemical screening Chemical screening was carried out using the classic method described previously by Iteku et al. (2020) and Nkasa et al. (2020). Evaluation of anti-sickle cell activity The Emmel test was performed according to the standard protocol as previously described by Bongo et al. (2017). The percentage of falciformation inhibition was calculated as follows (Kotue et al., 2019): SI =FO\u2212FN FOx100. Where, SI: percentage of falciformation inhibition, Fo: percentage of falciformation of the mixture [blood+ Na2S2O5] (negative control), and Fn: percentage of falciformation of the mixture [SS blood + extract or tested compound + Na2S205]. The percentage of inhibition was Ndjoko et al., Orapuh Journal 2024, 5(1), e1109 3 Orapuh | orapj.orapuh.org https://dx.doi.org/10.4314/orapj.v5i1.9 Phytochemistry and in vitro Anti-sickling activity of Senna Occidentalis L. (Fabaceae) used to calculate the normalization rate for each concentration according to the following formula: R(%) = SIn - Sio. Where (R) is the normalization rate (%), (SI0) is the initial percentage of sickling inhibition (control), and (SIn) is the maximum percentage of sickling inhibition obtained with different concentrations (15, 625 \u00b5g/mL, 31.25 \u00b5g/mL, 62.5 \u00b5g/mL, 125 \u00b5g/mL, 250 \u00b5g/mL, 500 \u00b5g/mL, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL). Dose-response curves were obtained using Origin 8.5 software. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phytochemical screening Table 1 gives the results of the chemical screening performed on the aqueous and organic extracts of S. occidentalis seeds. Table 1: Results of chemical screening performed on aqueous and organic extracts of S. occidentalis seeds N\u00b0 Chemical groups Results 1 Polyphenols + 2 Flavonoids + 3 Anthocyanins + 4 Leuco-anthocyanins + 5 Catechic tannins + 6 Gallic tannins + 7 Linked quinones + 8 Alkaloids + 9 Triterpenoids - 10 Steroids - 11 Diterpenoids + 12 Saponins + Legend: +: Presence of desired compound; -: Absence of desired compound Table 2 shows that S. occidentalis seeds are rich in secondary metabolites. A total of eight secondary metabolites were identified in S. occidentalis seeds: total polyphenols (flavonoids, anthocyanins, leuco-athocyanins, tannins, and saponins), di-terpenes, alkaloids, and bound quinones. However, these seeds do not contain triterpenoids and steroids. These results are like those of Nde et al. (2021), who found numerous phytochemical constituents such as flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, terpenes, and glycosides in this plant. The presence of compounds such as anthocyanins would justify the use of this plant in traditional Congolese medicine against SS anemia, as these compounds are known for their anti-sickle cell properties (Tshilanda et al., 2014; Kambale et al., 2013; Mpiana et al., 2007). Antifalcemic activity Induction of sickle cell disease Table 2 shows the results of red cell sickle cell induction.

These patients could be on hydroxyurea and/or antioxidant therapy. Antifalcemic effects on SS erythrocytes The results of the antifalcemic test on erythrocytes are shown in Table 3 below.

Table 3 shows that the negative control has a normalization rate of 0%, while the aqueous extracts of S. occidentalis seeds have antifalcemic properties. This indicates that extracts of this plant species can be applied to sickle-cell patients. Table 4 gives the antifalcemic effects of S. occidentalis extract on SS erythrocytes, at different concentrations (\u00b5g/mL).

Table 4 shows that S. occidentalis extracts have a high antifalcemic activity at concentrations of 125\u00b5g/mL and above. At higher concentrations, this activity rises to 93.5% and remains constant. At concentrations below 125\u00b5g/mL, however, the activity is uninteresting (<50%). Figure 1 gives the evolution of sickle cell normalization rates as a function of S. occidentalis extract concentrations. Figure 1: Sickle cell normalization rate as a function of S. occidentalis aqueous extract concentrations Figure 1 shows that the normalization rate increases with concentration, and reaches a fixed value above a certain concentration, known as the minimum normalization concentration. This is 125\u00b5g/mL for the total extract of S. occidentalis. It is much higher than those of the plants studied by Mpiana et al. (2007). These were : A. cordifolia (CMN: 0.097 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 93%), A. digitata (CMN: 0.43 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 80%), A. betzichiana (CMN: 0.12 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 90%), B. pentadrum (CMN: 0.81 \u00b5g/mL and NT: 78%), F. capensis (CMN: 04 \u00b5g/mL and NT: 89%), H. angustifolia (CMN: 0.42 \u00b5g/mL and NT: 90%), O. basilicum (CMN: 0.13 \u00b5g/mL and NT: 86%), Z. macronata (CMN: 0.7 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 87%), C. senegalensis (CMN: 0.15 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 90%), H. crepitans (CMN: 0.18 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 90%), D. brazzal (CMN: 0.11 \u00b5g/mL and TN: 86%). 0 150 300 450 600 750 900 1050-100102030405060708090100110Normalisation rate (%)Concentration (\u00b5g/mL)R2 = 0,8767p = 0,01519 Ndjoko et al., Orapuh Journal 2024, 5(1), e1109 5 Orapuh | orapj.orapuh.org https://dx.doi.org/10.4314/orapj.v5i1.9 Phytochemistry and in vitro Anti-sickling activity of Senna Occidentalis L. (Fabaceae) Figure 2: Antisickling test Microscopy: untreated erythrocytes (A); Erythrocytes treated with aqueous extract 125 \u03bcg/mL (B) of S. occidentalis (magnification X500). Figure 2(A) shows falciform red blood cells, effectively indicating that this is SS blood. On the other hand, Figure 2(B) shows the ability of the aqueous extract of S. occidentalis to modify the shape of SS red blood cells in vitro, transforming them from sickle-shaped (abnormal) to biconcave (normal), when placed under the same hypoxic conditions as the control in the presence of physiological solution. These results confirm previous work (Mpiana et al., 2007). These results show that our drugs prevent the various complications associated with sickle cell disease. This anti-sickle cell activity would be due to anthocyanins (Table 1), as anthocyanins have. CONCLUSION This study aimed to scientifically validate the anti-sickle cell activity of aqueous extracts of S. occindentalis seeds, as well as to identify the chemical constituents responsible for this activity. The results obtained in this study show that the seeds of this plant are rich in secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, leuco-athocyanins, tannins, saponins, di-terpenes, alkaloids, and bound quinones. However, they do not contain triterpenoids or steroids. The total seed extracts of this plant have significant anti-sickle cell activity. In addition, this study identified a medicinal plant used by Lele traditional healers in Ilebo territory, Kasai province, for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
