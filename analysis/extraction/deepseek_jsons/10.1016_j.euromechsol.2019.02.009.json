Flecka aDepartment of Engineering, Cambridge University, CB2 1PZ Cambridge, UK Abstract The mode I crack tip asymptotic response of a solid characterised by strain gradient plasticity is investigated. It is found that elastic strains dominate plastic strains near the crack tip, and thus the Cauchy stress and the strain state are given asymptotically by the elastic K-field. This crack tip elas- tic zone is embedded within an annular elasto-plastic zone. This feature is predicted by both a crack tip asymptotic analysis and a finite element com- putation. When small scale yielding applies, three distinct regimes exist: an outer elastic K field, an intermediate elasto-plastic field, and an inner elas- tic K field. The inner elastic core significantly influences the crack opening profile. Crack tip plasticity is suppressed when the material length scale \u2113 of the gradient theory is on the order of the plastic zone size estimation, as dictated by the remote stress intensity factor. A generalized J-integral for strain gradient plasticity is stated and used to characterise the asymptotic response ahead of a short crack.

Introduction Strain gradient plasticity is increasingly used in fracture analyses to pre- dict the stress elevation that accompanies gradients of plastic strain, see, for example, (Wei and Hutchinson, 1997; Jiang et al., 2001; Komaragiri et al., 2008; Nielsen et al., 2012; Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda et al., 2017b) and references therein. Gradients of plastic strain are associated with lattice curvature and geo- metrically necessary dislocations (Ashby, 1970), and the increased disloca- tion density promotes strengthening. Flow stress elevation in the presence of plastic strain gradients has been observed in a wide range of mechani- cal tests on micro-sized specimens. Representative examples are indenta- tion (Poole et al., 1996; Nix and Gao, 1998), torsion (Fleck et al., 1994), and bending (Sto\u00a8lken and Evans, 1998). These experiments typically predict a 3-fold increase in the effective flow stress by reducing the size of the speci- men (smaller is stronger). Isotropic, strain gradient plasticity theories have been developed to capture this size effect. The pivotal step in construct- ing these phenomenological models is to write the plastic work increment in terms of both the plastic strain and plastic strain gradient, thereby introduc- ing a length scale in the material description (Aifantis, 1984; Gao et al., 1999; Fleck and Hutchinson, 2001; Gurtin and Anand, 2005). Work-conjugate stress 2 quantities for plastic strain and plastic strain gradient follow immediately. The crack tip stress elevation, as predicted by strain gradient plasticity theory relative to conventional plasticity theory, plays a fundamental role in the modelling of numerous damage mechanisms (Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda and Betego\u00b4n, 2015; Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda and Niordson, 2016). Examples include fatigue (Brinckmann and Siegmund, 2008; Pribe et al., 2019), notch mechanics (Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda et al., 2017a), microvoid cracking (Tvergaard and Niordson, 2008), and hydrogen embrit- tlement (Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda et al., 2016a,b). In the present study, we examine the mode I crack tip field according to strain gradient plasticity theory (Gudmundson, 2004; Fleck and Willis, 2009). Previous crack tip asymptotic studies considered earlier gradient plasticity classes, such as couple-stress theories without stretch gradients (Huang et al., 1997; Xia and Hutchinson, 1996) or models involving the gra- dients of elastic strains (Chen et al., 1999). For such theories, plastic strains dominate elastic strains near the crack tip and the asymptotic nature of the crack tip field can be obtained by neglecting elasticity. This is analogous to the HRR (Hutchinson, 1968; Rice and Rosengren, 1968) analysis for a con- ventional elasto-plastic solid. We shall show in the present study that the crack tip field for Gudmundson- type strain gradient theories is of a different nature, such that the asymptotic crack tip field comprises both elastic and plastic straining, and it is not pos- sible to simplify the crack tip asymptotic state by neglecting elastic strains. 3 Instead, the elastic strain \u03b5eij scales as r \u22121/2 with distance r from the crack tip, whereas the plastic strain tensor \u03b5 \u223c p (x) is of the form \u03b5 \u223c p (x) = \u03b5 \u223c p (0) + \u03b5\u02dc \u223c p (x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (1) The leading order term \u03b5 \u223c p (0) has a finite value independent of x. The next term in the series, \u03b5\u02dc \u223c p (x), scales as r3/2 where r = |x| is the polar coor- dinate from the crack tip, and \u03b5\u02dc \u223c p (x) also depends upon the polar coordinate \u03b8. Thus, we can write \u03b5pij in polar coordinates as, \u2212 \u03b5prr = \u03b5p\u03b8\u03b8 = A cos (2\u03b8) + r3/2f (\u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (2) \u03b5pr\u03b8 = A sin (2\u03b8) + r 3/2g (\u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3) Later, in the paper, we shall obtain explicit expressions for the angular functions f (\u03b8) and g (\u03b8). Thus, the elastic strain is more singular than the plastic strain and the Cauchy stress \u03c3ij (r, \u03b8) is given by the usual elastic K-field in the vicinity of the crack tip. The following simple argument supports the finding that the crack tip is surrounded by an elastic K-field in an elastic-plastic strain gradient solid. Introduce a generalized effective plastic strain E\u02dcp such that ( E\u02dcp )2 = 2 3 \u03b5pij\u03b5 p ij + \u2113 2\u03b5pij,k\u03b5 p ij,k (4) in terms of a material length scale \u2113; the comma subscript (),k denotes spa- tial differentiation with respect to the coordinate xk in the usual manner. Consider the case of a deformation theory solid, and assume that the plastic strain energy density wp scales as E\u02dcp (N+1) in terms of a strain hardening 4 exponent N (where 0 \u2264 N \u2264 1). We proceed to show that the elastic strain must dominate the plastic strain. To do so, we shall explore the consequences of assuming that the plastic strain dominates the elastic strain near the crack tip. Then, wp must scale as J/r in order for the energy release rate for crack advance to be finite at the crack tip. Consequently, E\u02dcp and \u2113\u03b5pij,k scale as r\u22121/(N+1) and \u03b5pij scales as r N/(N+1). We conclude that \u03b5pij tends to zero as the crack tip is approached. If the elastic strain is dominated by the plastic strain then this implies that \u03b5eij tends to zero at a faster rate than r N/(N+1), and the crack tip will have a strain and a stress concentration of zero. This is implausible on physical grounds. We conclude that the elastic strain field must dominate the plastic strain field at the crack tip, and the Cauchy stress and elastic strain are given by the usual elastic K-field. 2. Strain Gradient Plasticity We idealise strain gradient effects by means of the Gudmundson (2004) higher order gradient plasticity model, see also Fleck and Willis (2009). A brief summary of the constitutive and field equations for a flow theory version of strain gradient plasticity is now presented. 2.1. Variational principles and balance equations The primal kinematic variables are the velocity u\u02d9i and the plastic strain rate \u03b5\u02d9pij. Upon adopting a small strain formulation, the total strain rate reads \u03b5\u02d9ij = 1 2 (u\u02d9i,j + u\u02d9j,i) (5) and is decomposed additively into elastic and plastic parts, \u03b5\u02d9ij = \u03b5\u02d9 e ij + \u03b5\u02d9 p ij (6) 5 Write the internal work within a volume V as \u03b4W = \u222b V ( \u03c3ij\u03b4\u03b5 e ij + qij\u03b4\u03b5 p ij + \u03c4ijk\u03b4\u03b5 p ij,k ) dV (7) where \u03c3ij denotes the Cauchy stress, qij the so-called micro-stress tensor (work-conjugate to the plastic strain \u03b5pij) and \u03c4ijk is the higher order stress tensor (work-conjugate to the plastic strain gradient \u03b5pij,k). The volume V is contained within a surface S of unit outward normal ni. Now make use of Gauss\u2019 divergence theorem to re-express \u03b4W as the external work on the surface S, \u03b4W = \u222b S ( \u03c3ijnj\u03b4ui + \u03c4ijknk\u03b4\u03b5 p ij ) dS (8) to obtain the following equilibrium equations within V : \u03c3ij,j = 0 sij = qij \u2212 \u03c4ijk,k (9) Here, sij is the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress such that sij = \u03c3ij \u2212 \u03b4ij\u03c3kk/3. Equations (7) and (8) constitute the Principle of Virtual Work,\u222b V ( \u03c3ij\u03b4\u03b5 e ij + qij\u03b4\u03b5 p ij + \u03c4ijk\u03b4\u03b5 p ij,k ) dV = \u222b S ( Ti\u03b4ui + tij\u03b4\u03b5 p ij ) dS (10) where Ti = \u03c3ijnj and tij = \u03c4ijknk denote the conventional and higher order tractions, respectively. 2.2. Constitutive laws The elastic strain \u03b5eij gives rise to an elastic strain energy density, we = 1 2 \u03b5eijCijkl\u03b5 e kl (11) 6 where Cijkl = Cklij is the isotropic elastic stiffness tensor, given in terms of Young\u2019s modulus E and Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd. We identify the elastic work increment \u03c3ij\u03b4\u03b5 e ij with \u03b4w e such that \u03c3ij = \u2202we \u2202\u03b5eij = Cijkl\u03b5 e kl (12) The stresses (qij , \u03c4ijk) are taken to be dissipative in nature and we assume that the plastic work rate w\u02d9p reads, qij\u03b4\u03b5\u02d9 p ij + \u03c4ijk\u03b4\u03b5\u02d9 p ij,k = \u03b4w\u02d9 p (13) where w\u02d9p(E\u02d9p) is given in terms of a combined effective plastic strain rate, E\u02d9p = ( 2 3 \u03b5\u02d9pij \u03b5\u02d9 p ij + \u2113 2\u03b5\u02d9pij,k\u03b5\u02d9 p ij,k )1/2 (14) thereby introducing a material length scale \u2113. The use of (13) implies imme- diately that qij = \u2202w\u02d9p \u2202\u03b5\u02d9pij = \u2202w\u02d9p \u2202E\u02d9p \u2202E\u02d9p \u2202\u03b5\u02d9pij (15) and \u03c4ijk = \u2202w\u02d9p \u2202\u03b5\u02d9pij,k = \u2202w\u02d9p \u2202E\u02d9p \u2202E\u02d9p \u2202\u03b5\u02d9pij,k (16) Upon introducing an overall effective stress \u03a3 = \u2202w\u02d9p/\u2202E\u02d9p, these expres- sions reduce to qij = 2 3 \u03a3 E\u02d9p \u03b5\u02d9pij and \u03c4ijk = \u03a3 E\u02d9p \u21132\u03b5\u02d9pij,k (17) Note that \u03a3 is work conjugate to E\u02d9p, such that it satisfies \u03a3E\u02d9p = qij \u03b5\u02d9 p ij + \u03c4ijk\u03b5\u02d9 p ij,k (18) and, upon making use of (14) and (17) we obtain the relation \u03a3 = ( 3 2 qijqij + \u2113 \u22122\u03c4ijk\u03c4ijk )1/2 (19) 7 3. Asymptotic analysis of crack tip fields 3.1. Deformation theory solid We begin our study by conducting an asymptotic analysis of the stress and strain state at the crack tip. As already discussed in the introduc- tion, consider a deformation theory solid such that the strain energy density w ( \u03b5eij , \u03b5 p ij, \u03b5 p ij,k ) is decomposed into an elastic part we and a plastic part wp, w ( \u03b5eij, \u03b5 p ij, \u03b5 p ij,k ) = we ( \u03b5eij ) + wp ( \u03b5pij, \u03b5 p ij,k ) (20) The elastic contribution is stated explicitly by (11). For the deformation theory solid the effective strain quantity E\u02dcp has already been introduced by (4). The dissipation potential wp is taken to be a power law function of E\u02dcp wp ( E\u02dcp ) = \u03c3Y \u03b5Y N + 1 ( E\u02dcp \u03b5Y )N+1 (21) in terms of a reference value of strength \u03c3Y , yield strain \u03b5Y = \u03c3Y /E and hard- ening index N (where 0 \u2264 N \u2264 1). Upon writing the dissipation increment \u03b4wp as \u03b4wp = qij\u03b4\u03b5 p ij + \u03c4ijk\u03b4\u03b5 p ij,k (22) and upon introducing the notation \u03a3 = \u2202wp/\u2202E\u02dcp, we have qij = \u2202wp \u2202\u03b5pij = \u03a3 \u2202E\u02dcp \u2202\u03b5pij = 2 3 \u03a3 E\u02dcp \u03b5pij (23) \u03c4ijk = \u2202wp \u2202\u03b5pij,k = \u03a3 \u2202E\u02dcp \u2202\u03b5pij,k = \u21132 \u03a3 E\u02dcp \u03b5pij,k (24) We note in passing that substitution of (23)-(24) into (4) recovers (19), and the relation between \u03a3 and E\u02dcp is of power law type, such that \u03a3 = \u2202wp \u2202E\u02dcp = \u03c3Y ( E\u02dcp \u03b5Y )N (25) 8 via (22). 3.2. Energy boundness analysis We proceed to obtain the asymptotic nature of \u03b5pij (r, \u03b8). The finite ele- ment solutions presented later in the study consistently reveal that the de- viatoric Cauchy stress sij scales as r \u22121/2. We shall adopt this scaling law for sij and explore its ramifications. First, note from (23) and (24) that \u03c4ijk, and consequently \u03c4ijk,k, are more singular in r than qij , as the crack tip is approached. Then, the equilibrium relation (9)b demands that sij \u223c \u2212\u03c4ijk,k (26) to leading order in r, and consequently \u03c4ijk is of order r 1/2. This imposes a severe restriction on the form of \u03b5pij (r, \u03b8). Assume the separation of variables form for \u03b5pij in terms of its Cartesian components \u03b5pij = Aij + r \u03b1Bij (\u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (27) where Aij is taken to be independent of \u03b8 and the index \u03b1 > 0 remains to be found. First we show that this form satisfies the field equations, and second we justify this choice. Accordingly, the plastic strain gradient reads \u03b5pij,k = \u03b1r \u03b1\u22121B\u00afijk (\u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (28) where B\u00afijk can be expressed in terms of Bij (\u03b8) and its derivatives with respect to \u03b8. Substitution of (27) and (28) into (4) gives ( E\u02dcp )2 = 4 3 AijAij + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (29) 9 along with \u03a3 Ep = \u03c3Y ( 2\u221a 3\u03b5Y )N\u22121 (AijAij) N\u22121 2 (30) Consequently, (26), (24) and (28) give sij = \u2212\u21132\u03c3Y ( 2\u221a 3\u03b5Y )N\u22121 (ApqApq) N\u22121 2 ( r\u03b1\u22121B\u00afijk (\u03b8) ) ,k (31) Upon recalling that sij scales as r \u22121/2 the above equation implies that \u03b1 = 3/2 for consistency. The above solution reveals that the elastic strain energy density wE scales as r\u22121 while the plastic strain energy density scales as r0, upon recalling (21) and (29). Now recall that we require w \u223c J/r in order for w = we + wp to give a finite energy release rate J at the crack tip. This is achieved by the elastic field whereas the plastic field is not sufficiently singular in r to give any contribution to the energy release rate. Alternative assumptions can be made for the series expansion of \u03b5pij in preference to (27). However, these do not give rise to an equilibrium solution (i.e., Eq. (26) is not satisfied) or they give solutions that are less singular than that of (29). For example, if we assume that the Cartesian components Aij are a function of \u03b8 we find that \u03b5pij,k scales as r \u22121 and \u03c4ijk,k scales as r \u2212(N+1), and the equi- librium relation (29) for sij is violated. Alternatively, if we take Aij = 0 then an equilibrium solution for sij is obtained provided we take \u03b1 = N/(N + 1). This leads to a higher order term in the series expansion of \u03b5pij than that given by the first two terms of (29). Finally, what is the implication of as- suming that \u03b1 < 0 in our asymptotic expression (29)? If we were to assume \u03b1 < 0, then the leading order term becomes r\u03b1Bij (\u03b8). Asymptotic matching of both sides of the equilibrium relation (26) again results in \u03b1 = N/(N +1), which is inconsistent with the initial assumption that \u03b1 < 0. 10 In summary, the plastic strain field \u03b5pij (r, \u03b8) is of the asymptotic form (27) with \u03b1 = 3/2, and the crack tip field for Cauchy stress \u03c3ij (r, \u03b8) and elastic strain \u03b5eij (r, \u03b8) is given by the usual K-field for a mode I crack. 3.3. Asymptotic crack tip fields Assume that the leading order terms in \u03b5pij, in polar coordinates, are of the form (2)-(3). This choice is consistent with the nature of the symmetry of the solution of a mode I crack tip problem; \u03b5p\u03b8\u03b8 and \u03b5 p rr are even in \u03b8 and give rise to \u03b5pyy = A = \u2212\u03b5pxx, \u03b5pxy = 0 in Cartesian coordinates. The components of the plastic strain gradient and the Laplacian of the plastic strain read \u03b5prr,r = \u2202\u03b5prr \u2202r = \u22123 2 r1/2f (\u03b8) (32) \u03b5prr,\u03b8 = 1 r ( \u2202\u03b5prr \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b5pr\u03b8 ) = \u2212r1/2 [3f \u2032 (\u03b8)\u2212 2g (\u03b8)] (33) \u03b5pr\u03b8,r = \u2202\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202r = 3 2 r1/2g (\u03b8) (34) \u03b5pr\u03b8,\u03b8 = 1 r ( \u2202\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 + 2\u03b5prr ) = r1/2 [g\u2032 (\u03b8)\u2212 f (\u03b8)] (35) and, \u03b5prr,kk = \u22022\u03b5prr \u2202r2 + 1 r \u2202\u03b5prr \u2202r + 1 r2 \u22022\u03b5prr \u2202\u03b82 \u2212 2 r2 ( \u03b5prr \u2212 \u03b5p\u03b8\u03b8 + 2 \u2202\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 ) (36) = r\u22121/2 [ 7 4 f (\u03b8)\u2212 f \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8) + 4g\u2032 (\u03b8) ] \u03b5pr\u03b8,kk = \u22022\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202r2 + 1 r \u2202\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202r + 1 r2 \u22022\u03b5pr\u03b8 \u2202\u03b82 + 2 r2 ( \u2202\u03b5prr \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 \u2202\u03b5 p \u03b8\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b5pr\u03b8 ) (37) = r\u22121/2 [ \u22127 4 g (\u03b8) + g\u2032\u2032 (\u03b8)\u2212 4f \u2032 (\u03b8) ] 11 Nowmake use of the higher order equilibrium equation (9)b, which asymp- totically implies sij \u2248 \u2212\u03c4ijk,k. Note that, as r \u2192 0, E\u02dcp is of leading order 2A/ \u221a 3 and can therefore be treated as a constant. As argued above and demonstrated numerically below, the Cauchy stress is characterized by an inner elastic K-field. Consequently, we make use of the Williams (1957) solution to write srr = KI 4 \u221a 2\u03c0r [ cos ( \u03b8 2 ) \u2212 cos ( 3\u03b8 2 )] (38) sr\u03b8 = KI 4 \u221a 2\u03c0r [ sin ( \u03b8 2 ) + sin ( 3\u03b8 2 )] (39) where KI is the mode I stress intensity factor. The higher order equilibrium follows by suitable substitution of (36)-(39) into (24) and (9)b, to give KIE\u02dc p 4\u03a3 \u221a 2\u03c0 [ cos ( \u03b8 2 ) \u2212 cos ( 3\u03b8 2 )] = \u22127 4 f (\u03b8) + \u22022f (\u03b8) \u2202\u03b82 + 4 \u2202g (\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8 (40) KIE\u02dc p 4\u03a3 \u221a 2\u03c0 [ sin ( \u03b8 2 ) + sin ( 3\u03b8 2 )] = 7 4 g (\u03b8)\u2212 \u2202 2g (\u03b8) \u2202\u03b82 + 4 \u2202f (\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8 (41) In addition, the symmetry condition ahead of a mode I crack tip demands that f (\u03b8) is an even function of \u03b8. Thus, the solution to the system of differential equations is given by f (\u03b8) = \u2212 KIE\u02dc p 16\u03a3 \u221a 2\u03c0 [ 2 cos ( 3\u03b8 2 ) + cos ( \u03b8 2 ) + a1 cos ( \u03b8 2 ) + a3 cos ( 7\u03b8 2 )] (42) g (\u03b8) = \u2212 KIE\u02dc p 16\u03a3 \u221a 2\u03c0 [ 2 sin ( 3\u03b8 2 ) \u2212 sin ( \u03b8 2 ) + a1 sin ( \u03b8 2 ) + a3 sin ( 7\u03b8 2 )] (43) Now make use of the traction-free boundary conditions trr = t\u03b8\u03b8 = 0 along the crack flanks (\u03b8 = \u03c0) to obtain a relation between the constants a1 12 and a3. Free boundary conditions on the higher order traction \u03c4\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 = 0 on \u03b8 = \u03c0 implies that f \u2032 (\u03b8) + 2g (\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = \u03c0 (44) rendering a1 = 7/3 \u2212 a3. Imposition of vanishing higher order traction \u03c4r\u03b8\u03b8 = 0 on \u03b8 = \u03c0 is identically satisfied and provides no useful additional in- formation on (a1, a3). It follows that numerical analysis is needed to calibrate a1 and a3 and obtain a full field solution. 4. Finite element analysis 4.1. Numerical implementation Wemake use of the finite element implementation of Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda et al. (2019) and employ the viscoplastic potential presented by Panteghini and Bardella (2016). The effective stress is related to the gradient-enhanced effective plas- tic flow rate through a viscoplastic function, \u03a3 = \u03c3F (E p) V (E\u02d9p) (45) where the current flow stress \u03c3F depends on the initial yield stress \u03c3Y and on Ep via a hardening law. We adopt the following isotropic hardening law, \u03c3F = \u03c3Y ( 1 + Ep \u03b5Y )N (46) and assume that the yield strain is \u03b5Y = \u03c3Y /E = 0.003. The viscoplastic function V (E\u02d9p) is defined as V (E\u02d9p) = \uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2 \uf8f4\uf8f3 E\u02d9p/ (2\u03b5\u02d90) if E\u02d9 p/\u03b5\u02d90 \u2264 1 1\u2212 \u03b5\u02d90/ ( 2E\u02d9p ) if E\u02d9p/\u03b5\u02d90 > 1 (47) 13 and the rate-independent limit is achieved by choosing a sufficiently small value of the material parameter \u03b5\u02d90. The numerical experiments conducted show that the ratio E\u02d9p/\u03b5\u02d90 is sufficiently high that V (E\u02d9 p) \u2248 1 in the vicinity of the crack for all remote K values considered. A mixed finite element scheme is adopted, such that displacements and plastic strains are treated as primary variables, in accordance with the the- oretical framework. The non-linear system of equations for a time t +\u2206t is solved iteratively by using the Newton-Raphson method,\uf8ee \uf8f0u \u03b5p \uf8f9 \uf8fb t+\u2206t = \uf8ee \uf8f0u \u03b5p \uf8f9 \uf8fb t \u2212 \uf8ee \uf8f0Ku,u Ku,\u03b5p K\u03b5p,u K\u03b5p,\u03b5p \uf8f9 \uf8fb \u22121 t \uf8ee \uf8f0Ru R\u03b5p \uf8f9 \uf8fb t (48) where the residuals comprise the out-of-balance forces, R n u = \u222b V \u03c3ijB n ij dV \u2212 \u222b S TiN n i dS (49) R n \u03b5p = \u222b V [ (qij \u2212 sij)Mnij + \u03c4ijkMnij,k ] dV \u2212 \u222b S tijM n ij,k dS (50) Here, Bij denotes the strain-displacement matrix, and Ni and Mij are the shape functions for the nodal values of displacement and plastic strain com- ponents. The components of the consistent stiffness matrix are obtained by differentiating the residuals with respect to the incremental nodal variables. The reader is referred to Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pan\u02dceda et al. (2019) for full details. 4.2. The small scale yielding solution We make use of the so-called boundary layer formulation to prescribe an outerK-field. Consider a crack with tip at the origin and with the crack plane 14 along the negative axis of the Cartesian reference frame (x, y). A remote K field is imposed by prescribing the nodal displacements in the outer periphery of the mesh as, ui = K E r1/2fi (\u03b8, \u03bd) (51) where \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio and the functions fi (\u03b8, \u03bd) are given by fx = 1 + \u03bd\u221a 2\u03c0 (3\u2212 4\u03bd \u2212 cos \u03b8) cos ( \u03b8 2 ) (52) and fy = 1 + \u03bd\u221a 2\u03c0 (3\u2212 4\u03bd \u2212 cos \u03b8) sin ( \u03b8 2 ) (53) Upon exploiting the symmetry about the crack plane, only half of the finite element model is analysed. A mesh sensitivity study reveals that it is adequate to discretise the domain by approximately 5200 plane strain, quadratic, quadrilateral elements. A representative small scale yielding solution is now presented in Figs. 1 and 2, for the choice K = 20\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113, N = 0.1, \u03b5Y = 0.003, and \u03bd = 0.3. Conventional J2 flow theory implies a plastic zone size R0 of magnitude R0 = 1 3\u03c0 ( K \u03c3Y )2 (54) and so the choice K = 20\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113 implies R0 = 42\u2113. Consequently, the plastic zone size is much larger than \u2113 for the strain gradient solid also. The plastic zone is plotted in Fig. 1 by showing contours of von Mises plastic strain, \u03b5p = ( 2 3 \u03b5pij\u03b5 p ij )1/2 (55) 15 In broad terms, the outer boundary of the plastic zone is given by the con- tour \u03b5p/\u03b5Y = 0.1. Additional contours for \u03b5p/\u03b5Y = 1 and 3 are included. It is found that \u03b5p/\u03b5Y attains a plateau value slightly greater than 3 within the contour \u03b5p/\u03b5Y = 3. Consequently, the stress state within this crack tip zone is elastic in nature. This finding is supported by a plot of tensile stress \u03c3yy as a function of r directly ahead of the crack tip (y = 0), see Fig. 2a. The stress component \u03c3yy scales as r \u22121/2 for sufficiently small r. Likewise, the elastic strain component \u03b5eyy scales as r \u22121/2 for r/\u2113 < 1, see Fig. 2b. Farther from the crack tip (1 < r/\u2113 < 10) the stress profile \u03c3yy varies with r in the manner of the HRR field, \u03c3\u03b8\u03b8 \u223c r\u2212N/(N+1). Beyond the plastic zone (r/\u2113 > 10) the stress state again converges to the elastic K-field and \u03c3yy scales as r \u22121/2. Thus, both an outer and an inner K field exist. The distributions of \u03b5eyy(r) and \u03b5pyy(r) are shown in Fig. 2b. Within the elastic zone at the crack tip, and in the outer elastic zone, we have \u03b5eyy >> \u03b5 p yy. In contrast, within the annual region of the crack tip plastic zone, the plastic strains dominate and \u03b5pyy > \u03b5 e yy. The following J-integral argument can be used to show that the magni- tude of K for the crack tip elastic zone is identical to that in the outer field. Write the potential energy P of the cracked solid as P (a) = \u222b V w dV \u2212 \u222b ST ( T\u221ei ui + t \u221e ij \u03b5 p ij ) dS (56) where (T\u221ei , t \u221e ij ) are the prescribed tractions on a partial boundary ST , with outward normal ni. Define J as the energy release rate per unit crack exten- sion, such that J = \u2212\u2202P \u2202a (57) 16 for a body of unit thickness in the z direction. Note that\u222e ( wnx \u2212 \u03c3ijnjui,x \u2212 \u03c4ijknk\u03b5pij,x ) dS \u2261 0 (58) for any closed contour in the solid that excludes the crack tip. Also note that \u03c3ijnj = 0 and \u03c4ijknk = 0 on the faces of a traction-free crack. Then, an evaluation of J for a contour \u0393 which encloses the crack tip, starts on the lower crack flank and ends on the upper flank, gives J = \u222b \u0393 ( wnx \u2212 \u03c3ijnjui,x \u2212 \u03c4ijknk\u03b5pij,x ) dS (59) where the crack lies along the negative x-axis. The proof is straightforward and follows that outlined by (Eshelby, 1956; Rice, 1968) for the conventional deformation theory solid, absent strain gradient effects. Now evaluate the contour integral J assuming that the stress state (and associated strain energy density w) is given by an elastic K-field. Direct evaluation gives the Irwin relation EJ/(1\u2212 \u03bd2) = K2. Upon performing this integration within the crack tip elastic zone of the strain gradient solid, and repeating the evaluation in the outer K-field remote from the crack tip, path independence of J immediately implies that the magnitude of K is the same in the two zones. 4.3. Sensitivity of crack tip fields to strain hardening and material length scale We proceed to examine the influence of the strain hardening exponent N upon the crack tip stress state, see Fig. 3a. Consistent with the analytical 17 asymptotic analysis of Section 3, the near-tip asymptotic response is inde- pendent of the value of N and the three regimes (outer K, elastic-plastic field and inner K) can be readily identified for the three values of N considered. The strain state near the crack tip is shown in the form of the components \u03b5pyy and \u03b5yy versus r/\u2113 in Fig. 3b. The asymptotic value of \u03b5 p yy(r \u2192 0) increases slightly with decreasing N . The zone of almost constant \u03b5pyy near the crack tip is of similar size for N = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3: the size of the elastic core scales with \u2113 and is independent of N . The dependence of \u03b5pyy(r \u2192 0) upon K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113) is plotted in Fig. 4 for selected values of N . At small K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113), negligible plasticity exists near the crack tip - the plastic zone vanishes. At larger K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113) a plastic zone exists and \u03b5pyy(r \u2192 0) increases. The tensile stress component \u03c3yy is shown as a function of r in Fig. 5 for several values of \u2113/R0. The reference size of the plastic zone R0 is given by Irwin\u2019s approximation (54). For the strain gradient solid the plastic zone is approximately of size R0 since \u03c3yy/\u03c3Y \u2248 1 at r/R0 = 1 for all \u2113/R0 values considered. Also, the inner elastic zone is of extent \u2113 to a good approxima- tion. Consequently, the active plastic zone exists between r \u223c \u2113 and r \u223c R0. 4.4. Influence on the crack profile and in inhibiting plasticity Strain gradient plasticity influences the crack tip profile \u03b4(r) behind the crack tip. Fig. 6 shows the crack opening profile for conventional (\u2113 = 0) and strain gradient plasticity (\u2113 = 0.05R0), along with the solutions from the HRR field and from linear elasticity. The HRR field crack opening profile is 18 given by \u03c3YE\u03b4 K2 = \u03b1 ( r\u03c3YE K2 ) N N+1 (60) while the elastic solution reads \u03c3YE\u03b4 K2 = \u03b2 ( r\u03c3YE K2 ) 1 2 (61) with \u03b1 = 0.18 and \u03b2 = 0.48. The finite element results show large differences between conventional and gradient-enhanced plasticity solutions. Strain gra- dient plasticity sharpens the crack profile to resemble that of an elastic solid. Now consider the sensitivity of the plastic zone size rp to the magnitude of K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113). We have already noted that, when K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113) is significantly large, the plastic zone size scales with Irwin\u2019s approximation R0 as given by (54). In contrast, when K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113) is small, we anticipate that the inner elastic core of dimension \u2113 dominates the plastic zone; this is shown in Fig. 7. In order to define the size of the plastic zone rp, a criterion is needed for active yielding. Here, we assume that the plastic zone extends to either the location where \u03b5p/\u03b5Y = 0.1 or 1, see Fig. 7. It is clear from the figure that the plastic zone size rp scales with K 2/\u03c32Y in the same manner as the conventional elastic-plastic solid for sufficiently large K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113). However, at small K/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113), on the order of 5 to 10, the plastic zone vanishes. At an intermediate value ofK/(\u03c3Y \u221a \u2113) the active plastic zone for the strain gradient solid is somewhat larger than that predicted for the conventional solid. 4.5. Regime of J-dominance The small scale yielding (SSY) approach is valid provided the crack length is much greater than the plastic zone size R0 at the onset of frac- 19 ture, a > 7.5\u03c0R0. Thus, on a map with axes a/R0 and \u2113/R0 the small scale yielding regime exists for a/R0 > 7.5\u03c0; this is shown explicitly in Fig. 8. If a/R0 is in the range 75\u03c0\u03b5Y < a/R0 < 7.5\u03c0, then a J-field exists near the crack tip and the valid loading parameter becomes J instead of K. This regime of J-dominance is also sketched in Fig. 8. We proceed to explore the stress state near the crack tip for the case of J-dominance. To do so we consider a deeply notched beam in three point bending and calculate the tensile stress state ahead of the crack tip. We follow the ASTM E 1820-01 Standard2 and model a three point single edge bend specimen, as outlined in Fig. 9. We take advantage of symme- try and model only half of the specimen, with a total of 24000 quadratic quadrilateral plane strain elements. The J-integral is computed following the ASTM E 1820 Standard, J = Je + Jp (62) with Je being computed from the remote load and the specimen dimensions and Jp being calculated from the area below the force versus displacement curve. A reference length scale R0 can be defined from the estimated value of J as R0 = 1 3\u03c0 (1\u2212 \u03bd2) EJ \u03c32Y (63) Crack tip stresses for a/R0 = 0.8 and W/R0 = 1.6 are shown in Fig. 10 for strain gradient plasticity (\u2113/R0 = 0.1) and conventional plasticity theory. 2Standard No. ASTM E 1820-01 \u201cStandard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness,\u201d American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA. 20 Finite element results reveal that the elastic core is still present for the case of J-dominance; the strain gradient plasticity prediction exhibits the elastic 1/ \u221a r singularity as r \u2192 0. Thus short cracks, where small scale yielding does not apply, also exhibit an elastic stress state near the crack tip. 5. Conclusions We examine, numerically and analytically, the crack tip asymptotic re- sponse in metallic materials. The solid is characterised by strain gradient plasticity theory, aiming to phenomenologically link scales in fracture me- chanics by incorporating the stress elevation due to dislocation hardening. Results reveal that an elastic zone is present in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip. The stresses follow the linear elastic r\u22121/2 singularity and the plastic strains reach a plateau at a distance to the crack tip that scales with the length scale of strain gradient plasticity \u2113. The dominant role of elastic strains in the vicinity of the crack invalidates asymptotic analyses that ne- glect their contribution to the total strains. The existence of an elastic core is reminiscent of a dislocation free zone, as introduced by Suo et al. (1993). The emergence of an elastic core has important implications on the on- set of plasticity and the crack opening profile. Numerical predictions show that strain gradient plasticity sharpens the crack opening profile to that of an elastic solid. Differences with conventional plasticity are substantial and results suggest that an experimental characterisation of the crack opening profile could be used to infer the value of the length scale parameter. On the other hand, plasticity is precluded if the remote load is not sufficiently large, 21 such that the plastic zone size (as given by, e.g., Irwin\u2019s approximation) falls within the elastic core domain. In addition, we show that the inner elastic regime is also present when the crack is small and an outer elastic K field does not exist. A generalised J-integral is presented for strain gradient solids and the stress fields are computed under J-dominance conditions in a three point single edge bend specimen. Finally, we note that the material length scale \u2113 is on the order of a few microns for most metals. This is roughly the smallest scale at which void nucleation and growth occur, suggesting that the transition to an inner zone dominated by elasticity will have important implications in quasi-cleavage but play a secondary role in ductile fracture. 6.
