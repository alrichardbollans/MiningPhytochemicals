(ASTERACEAE)Donald Scott Grierson, Wilfred Mbeng Otang and Anthony Jide AfolayanMedicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Center, Botany Department, University of Fort Hare, Private BagX1314, Alice 5700, Eastern Cape, South Africa.*E-mail: dgrierson@ufh.ac.za; wilfredotang5@yahoo.com; aafolayan@ufh.ac.zaAbstractBackground: Arctotis arctotoides (Asteraceae) is commonly used by the rural people of Eastern Cape for the treatment of epilepsy, indigestion,catarrh and stomach ache. The leaf paste or juice is applied topically in the treatment of wounds and skin disorders. Unfortunately, no previousreviews are available for this important medicinal plant. Hence, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the botany, phyto-chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Arctotis arctotoides.Methodology: This review was carried out using a comprehensive and systematic literature search on the following databases: Google Scholar,PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus. Searches were undertaken using the key word \u201cArctotis arctotoides\u201d and the six synonyms of Arctotisarctotoides identified in the Plant List.Results: In the first phyto-chemical study of Arctotis arctotoides, the authors reported that sesquiterpenoids presence was predominant in the root oilwhereas, the essential oils of the leaves, flowers and stems had both monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids. The literature survey revealed that Arctotisarctotoides has been investigated in four pharmacological areas, including anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-cancer and anti-oxidant activities. Threetoxicity screens for the crude extracts of A. arctotoides on cell lines, rats and brine shrimp were identified in the literature.Conclusion: Detailed studies on the bioactivity of the crude extracts and the isolated phyto-chemicals have provided partial evidence as regards thetraditional use of A. arctotoides in the treatment of wounds in Eastern Cape of South Africa. However, in order to fully exploit the medicinal potentialof A. arctotoides, the expansion of existing traditional knowledge into neighboring communities where the plant is not currently in use for the statedindications will support a greater use of the plant in primary healthcare.Key words: Arctotis arctotoides, botany, phyto-chemistry, pharmacology and toxicologyList of abbreviations: ABTS: 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid; BHT: Butylated hydroxytoluene; DPPH: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ; FRAP: Ferric reducing ability of plasma; MIC: Minimum inhibitory concentration; MTT: 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-. 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RPMI 1640 medium: Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium; SEM: Scanning electron microscope; TLC: Thin layerchromatography.IntroductionArctotis arctotoides is a fast-growing, soft, herbaceous plant that is widespread in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and Lesotho,usually in disturbed areas like road verges. The plant is used by the rural people of Eastern Cape for the treatment of epilepsy, indigestion, catarrh andstomach ache, with the leaf juice or a paste of the leaf applied topically to treat wounds (van der Walt, 2002). To the best of our knowledge, noprevious reviews are available regarding the botany, phytochemistry and pharmacological studies of Arctotis arctotoides. Hence, the aim of thisreview is to provide a comprehensive overview of the botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Arctotis arctotoides. Additionally,evidence of traditional uses of this important medicinal plant has been examined and recommendations pertaining to future research areas for the planthighlighted.MethodologyThis review was carried out using a comprehensive and systematic literature search on the medicinal plant Arctotis arctotoides (L.f.)O.Hoffm. The following databases were used: Google-Scholar (http://scholar.google.com), PubMed (http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), Science-Direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com and Scopus (http://www.scopus.com). Additional search were also undertaken using the six synonyms identifiedby the plant list (www. the plantlist.org/): Arctotis decurrens; Arctotis micrantha; Arctotis spathuligera; Venidium arctotoides; Venidium decurrens;Venidium spathuligerumTaxonomy, vernacular names and distributionAsteraceae or Compositae (commonly referred to as the aster, daisy, or sunflower family) is an exceedingly large and widespread family ofAngiosperms (Jeffrey, 2007). This is the largest family of the flowering plants with more than 24000 - 30000 species and 1600 - 1700 genera (Funk et.al, 2005) worldwide and inhabit almost every environment and continent except Antarctica. The main feature of the family is the composite flowertype surrounded by involucral bracts (Bremer, 1994). The genus Arctotis comprises an estimated 50\u201360 species and belongs to the tribe Arctotideae.The representatives of this genus are indigenous to the Flora of Southern Africa region, with the highest concentration of taxa in Western Cape(Mckenzie, 2006). Arctotis venusta Norl., has the widest distribution, extending to Angola and Southern Zimbabwe, Arctotis stoechadifolia P.J.Bergius is in cultivation and has been introduced into other countries (Pope 1992), while Arctotis arctotoides is widespread throughout the summer /Grierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. (2014) 11(6):118-126http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ajtcam.v11i6.12119rainfall areas of South Africa and Lesotho, usually in disturbed areas like road verges. A. arctotoides is commonly called \u201cbotterblom\u201d in Afrikaans,\u201cputswa-pududu\u201d in South Sotho, and \u201cubushwa\u201d in Xhosa (van der Walt, 2002). The following names are considered as synonyms to A. arctotoidesby the plant list (www.plantlist.org): Arctotis decurrens (Less.) O. Hoffm., Arctotis micrantha Thunb. ex DC., Arctotis spathuligera (DC.) O. Hoffm.,Osteospermum arctotoides L.f., Venidium arctotoides (L.f.) Less., Venidium decurrens Less., and Venidium spathuligerum DC.Botany and Traditional UsesArctotis arctotoides is a fast-growing, soft, herbaceous plant with green foliage and butter-yellow daisy flowers almost throughout the year.Each leaf is about 10-15 cm long with a wavy edge and prominent midrib. The stems are about 20 cm long and both the leaves and stems are coveredwith small white hairs. The single daisy flowers which are borne on the stems are about 4 cm in diameter and contain bright yellow ray florets at thecentre. The undersides of the petals are purplish brown and are clearly visible when the flowers are in bud or closed during a cloudy day.The rural people of Eastern Cape Province of South Africa are known to use Arctotis arctotoides for the treatment of epilepsy, indigestion and catarrhof the stomach and the leaf juice or paste of the leaf is applied topically to treat wounds and fungal infections of the skin (Afolayan, 2003; Otang et al.,2012a).Figure 1: Arctotis arctotoides (Asteraceae)(Source: http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/plants/asteraceae/arctotis_arctotoides.htm)Chemical constituentsSome of the key phytochemicals that have been isolated and characterized from Arctotis arctotoides and published in academic journals arepresented in Table 1. The phytochemicals are labeled 1-33 and include isolated compounds: 27 terpenes, 1 sterol and 2 flavones and families ofcompounds (flavonoids, poroanthocyanidins and polyphenols) as well. The first phytochemical study on the essential oil of Arctotis arctotoides wascarried out by hydro-distillation of the leaves, flowers, stems and roots (Oyedeji et al., 2005). Sesquiterpenoids predominated in the root oil (97.9%)while the essential oils of the leaves, flowers and stems had both monoterpenoids (34.1\u201354.5%) and sesquiterpenoids (38.7\u201351.9%). Terpinen-4-ol(5.6\u201312.6%), \uf062-caryophyllene (6.1\u20136.9%) and \uf067-curcumene (6.9\u20138.49%) were the major compounds (numbered 1-30) common to the three oils(Oyedeji et al., 2005).Sultana and Afolayan (2007) reported the isolation and identification of a new daucosterol derivative 3-O-[\uf062-D-(6\u2019-nadeanoate)glucopyranosyl]- \uf062-sitosterol and seven known compounds namely: serratagenic acid, stigmasterol, daucosterol, zaluzanin D, dehydrocostuslactone,nepetin, and pedalitin (Figure 1). Subsequently, bioassay guided fractionation of different extracts of Arctotis arctotoides, combined with NMRspectral analysis led to the isolation of glycerol-1-docosanoate, zaluzanin C and perydiscolic acid (Sultana et al., 2008).Pharmacological ReportsThe literature survey revealed that Arctotis arctotoides has been investigated in four pharmacological areas, including antibacterial,antifungal, anticancer and anti-oxidant activities. The available pharmacological studies with detailed conditions are listed in Table 2.Grierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. (2014) 11(6):118-126http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ajtcam.v11i6.12120Antibacterial ActivitiesA number of in vitro studies have been reported regarding the antibacterial activity of the aqueous, ethanol, methanol and acetone extracts ofArctotis arctotoides (Afolayan, 2003; Afolayan et al., 2007; Sultana and Afolayan, 2007 and Sultana et al., 2008). Afolayan (2003) reported strongantibacterial activity of the acetone, methanol and water whole shoot extracts of Arctotis arctotoides against gram positive bacteria: Bacillus cereus,Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus kristinae and Staphylococcus aureus. None of the extracts inhibited Klebsiella pneumoniae andPseudomonous aeruginosa, both Gram negative bacteria. Afolayan et al. (2007) reported strong antibacterial activity by the acetone extract of Arctotisarctotoides root against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus kristinae, and Streptococcus pyrogens. No MICs were determined andowing to a lack of positive control, the antibacterial activity of Arctotis arctotoides extracts cannot be compared objectively with modern antibiotics,making it difficult to draw conclusion from this study as regards the utilization of the plant for the management of bacterial infections in traditionalmedicine.Table 1: Key phytochemicals isolated from Arctotis arctotoidesNo Phytochemical Plant part ReferenceTerpenes1 \u03b1-Phellandrene Leaf, stem2 \uf064-3-Carene Leaf3 \u03b1-Terpinene Flower, stem4 p-cymene Leaf, stem5 Limonene Leaf, flower, stem6 1,8-Cineole Leaf, flower7 \uf067-Terpinene Leaf, flower, stem8 trans-Sabinene hydrate Leaf, flower, stem9 Terpinolene Leaf, flower, stem10 Linalool Leaf, flower11 cis-Sabinene hydrate Stem12 cis-p-Menth-2-en-1-ol Leaf, flower, stem13 trans-p-Menth-2-en-1-ol Leaf14 Verbenol Flower15 p-Mentha-1,5-dien-8-ol Flower, stem16 Terpinen-1-ol Flower17 Terpinen-4-ol Leaf, flower18 Cymen-8-ol Flower19 \u03b1-Terpineol Leaf, flower, stem20 Myrtenol Leaf, flower, stem21 trans-Pipertiol Leaf, flower, stem22 Piperitone Leaf, flower, stem23 Perlialdehyde Leaf1-23: Oyedeji et al., 200524 Zaluzanin Shoot Sultana and Afolayan, 2007;Sultana et al., 200825 Perydiscolic acid Shoot Sultana et al., 200826 Serratagenic acid Shoot Sultana and Afolayan, 200727 Dehydrocostuslactone Shoot Sultana and Afolayan, 2007Sterol28 3-O-[_\uf062-D-(60-nonadeanoate)glucopyranosyl]-\uf062-sitosterolShoot Sultana and Afolayan, 2007Flavone29 Nepetin Shoot Sultana and Afolayan, 200730 Pedalitin Shoot Sultana and Afolayan, 200731 Flavonoids Roots Afolayan et al., 200732 Polyphenol Roots Afolayan et al., 200733 Proanthocyanidins Roots Afolayan et al., 2007Grierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med.

Among the compounds (nepetin, stigmasterol,daucosterol, dehydrocostuslactone, serratagenic acid, zaluzanin and pedalitin) isolated from the shoot of A. arctotoides, weak antibacterial activitywas observed for nepetin against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs of 4mg/ml and 31mg/ml respectively. No antibacterialactivity was reported for stigmasterol, daucosterol and dehydrocostuslactone while moderate antibacterial activity by serratagenic acid and pedalitinwas observed (Sultana et al., 2008).Antifungal activityA series of studies on the antifungal activity of A. arctotoides have been reported (Afolayan, 2003; Afolayan et al., 2007; Otang et al., 2011;Otang et al., 2012b). The water extract of the shoot of A. arctotoides was particularly inhibitory to the growth of Aspergillus tamari and Penicillumdigitatum with inhibitory activity ranging from 50.7 to 95.2% respectively (Afolayan, 2003). Significant antifungal activity by the acetone extract ofthe root of A. arctotoides was reported (Afolayan et al., 2007) with growth inhibition ranging from 56.23% on Aspergillus flavus to 100% onPenicillium notatum and Mucor heamalis at 5.0 mg/ml. The water extract showed the least inhibitory activity. However, the lack of positive controlsin the above studies makes it difficult to conclude about the antifungal activity of A. arctotoides.Grierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med.

(2011) investigated the effect of the acetone extract of A. arctotoides on the growth and ultra-structure of some opportunisticfungi (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Microsporum canis) associated with HIV/AIDS by means of scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). Remarkable morphological alterations in the fungal mycelia which were attributed to the loss of cell wall strength ranged fromloss of turgidity and uniformity, collapse of entire hyphae to evident destruction of the hyphae. The inhibition of mycelia growth ranged from 0% in A.fumigatus at a concentration of 0.32 mg/ml of plant extract to 65.3% in C. albicans at the highest concentration of 5 mg/ml. The plant extract inhibitedmycelia growth in C. albicans and M. canis in a dose-dependent manner. The observed alterations in the fungal ultra-structure were attributed to theimpact of the plant extract on the cell wall with the resultant changes in the fungal hyphae. The hexane and the acetone extracts of the leaves of A.artotoides were reported to be active against 6 out of 10 fungi, against 7 out of the 10 tested fungi respectively, with zones of inhibition varying from8 to 32 mm (Otang et al., 2012). Highest antifungal activity was obtained with the hexane extract of A. arctotoides with MICs of 0.005 mg/ml againstT. mucoides and 0.04 mg/ml against A. niger, and considering the fact that the mean inhibition zone diameters of A. arctotoides (hexane) and thepositive control (Nystatin) were not significantly different (P > 0.05) suggests that A. arctotoides appear to have high efficacy with a broad spectrumof antifungal activityGrierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. (2014) 11(6):118-126http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ajtcam.v11i6.12125Anticancer activityDichloromethane and methanol extracts of A. arctotoides were assayed in 3 cell lines (renal TK10, breast MCF7, melanoma UACC62) in96 well micro-titre plates containing RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at 37oC, 5% CO2 (Fouche et al., 2008). The assay results for the extractsscreened were reported as total growth inhibition values. Moderate anticancer activity with total growth inhibition at 12.70, 16.81 and 13.74\u00b5g/ml inrenal TK10, breast MCF7 and Melanoma UACC62 cell lines respectivelyAntioxidant activityThe in vitro antioxidant properties of the acetone, methanol and water extracts of A. arctotoides root extracts were screened through ABTS(2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma) and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radicalscavenging effects (Afolayan et al., 2007). For the DPPH assay, the methanol, water and acetone extracts showed a lower potency than ascorbic acidand BHT at all tested concentrations. In the ABTS assay, the scavenging activity of the acetone root extract (96.7%) was not significantly higher thanthat of BHT (96.3%) at 0.1 mg/ml and similarly, the FRAP values for the acetone (80.43) and methanol (81.86) extracts were comparable to that ofBHT (62.3).ToxicityThe toxicity tests undertaken on A. arctotoides reported in the literature are summarized in Table 2. Three toxicity screens for the crudeextracts of A. arctotoides on cell lines, rats and brine shrimp were identified in the literature. Graded doses of the aqueous extract from the shoot of A.arctotoides (400, 800, 1,600 and 3,200 mg/kg body weight) were separately administered to mice in a test group while the control group was treatedwith orally administered distilled water (3ml/kg) (Jimoh et al., 2008). Clinical chemistry and histopathological examination of major organs wereperformed on all the animals. The extract did not cause any significant change in the red blood cell count, packed cell volume, haemoglobinconcentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin even up to the dose of2000 mg/kg body weight. No significant lesions were observed in the organs examined and no behavioral changes or deaths were recorded in the miceafter 48 hr of administration of the extract. The extract also caused significant decrease in the level of platelets, total conjugated and un-conjugatedbilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in all the experimental groups when compared to the control group (Jimoh et al., 2008). However, all dosescaused a significant increase in the levels of white blood cell count and its differentials. Based on the findings of Jimoh et al. (2008), it may be inferredthat the aqueous extract of A. arctotoides has no toxic effect on the red blood cell parameters. The decrease in the level of platelets induced by theextracts indicates that the continued administration of the extract may lead to haemorrhage, however, considering the absence of neither mortality norbehavioral changes in the treated animals (Jimoh et al., 2008), the plant may be safe for medicinal uses.Otang et al., (2013a) investigated the cytotoxicity of the hexane and acetone extracts of Arctotis arctotoides against the Chang Liver cell lineusing the in vitro MTT assay. The IC50 values for the acetone and hexane extracts were 17.4 and 12.4 \u03bcg/ml respectively, lower than that of grieseofulvin (9.02 \u03bcg/ml), which was used as positive control. In another study (Otang et al., 2013b), the hexane and acetone extracts of A.arctotoides were assayed for toxicity to hatching and larval mortality of Artemia salina. Based on Meyer\u2019s toxicity index, the acetone extract of A.arctotoides with LC50 values > 1 mg/ml was considered as non-toxic and may be further explored for the development of plant-based pharmaceuticals(Otang et al., 2013b).ConclusionA. arctotoides is an important medicinal plant in South Africa and continues to be frequently prescribed in traditional medicine especially bythe rural people of Eastern Cape Province for the treatment of epilepsy, indigestion and catarrh of the stomach, skin infections and wounds (van derWalt, 2002). Justification of its traditional use has been supported by a number of studies detailing the bioactivity of the crude extracts and the isolatedphytochemicals (Tables 1 & 2). Crude extracts and phytochemicals from the root and shoot of A. arctotoides were reported to have demonstratedpotent anti-microbial properties against a number of bacteria and fungi. Three of the compounds isolated from the shoot of A. arctotoides (Sultana etal., 2008) showed moderate antibacterial activity. In addition, the hexane extract of the plant showed high antifungal activity with a broad spectrum ofaction. These results provide partial evidence regarding the traditional use of A. arctotoides in the treatment of wounds in Eastern Cape of SouthAfrica.One of the traditional uses of A. arctotoides is the management of skin diseases (Otang et al., 2014). However, no studies have been carriedout on the anti-inflammatory properties of A. arctotoides extract although inflammation is common to many skin problems. Skin diseases have been ofmajor concern recently due to the association of skin opportunistic infections and HIV/AIDS. With an HIV prevalence rate of 16.6% amongst SouthAfricans aged between 15 \u2013 49 years, South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world (Statistics South Africa, 2011). Skin diseases such asdermatitis, prurigo, scabies, and papular urticaria are either untreated or over-treated with strong topical steroids or antibiotics which have been foundto cause considerable disability (Njoroge and Bussmann, 2007). These short-comings, including the appearance of drug-resistant microbial strainshave resulted in increased efforts for the search of better antimicrobial agents and much attention is now being directed towards natural products(Abbasi et al., 2010). Hence, further research on the anti-inflammatory properties of A. arctotoides seems warranted.Given the widespread search for alternative medicines with novel mechanisms of actions from plants, it is surprising that there are currentlyno reports on the traditional uses of A. arctotoides outside the borders of South Africa. This endemism of A. arctotoides to South Africa may partiallyaccount for the limited amount of scientific research that has been carried out on the plant. Hence, in order to fully exploit the medicinal potential of A.arctotoides, there are perhaps two main areas for potential development. The first is to ensure the expansion of existing traditional knowledge from theareas where A. arctotoides is currently used for traditional medicine into neighboring communities where the plant is not used for the statedindications. Ultimately such knowledge expansion and sharing will support the greater use of the plant in primary healthcare (TRAMIL, 2011).Secondly, the possible mechanisms explaining the antibacterial and antifungal activity deserve to be investigated.Grierson et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med.
