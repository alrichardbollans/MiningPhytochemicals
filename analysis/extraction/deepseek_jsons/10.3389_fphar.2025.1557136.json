Among them, flavonoids are considered the mostrepresentative active metabolites. Numerous in vivo and in vitrostudies have demonstrated the wide range of biological activitiesexhibited by these compounds, including anti-inflammatory,analgesic, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-atherosclerosis, and anti-oxidation. In modern clinical practice, T. angustifolia is utilized inthe treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, hyperlipidemia, andfundus vascular lesions (Li and Xu, 2018; Qin et al., 2017; Zhu,2002). It is noteworthy that, as a marsh plant, T. angustifolia alsoplays a role in improving environmental water quality(Grebenshchykova et al., 2020; Nabuyanda et al., 2019; Reyeset al., 2013). It has a beneficial purification effect on heavy metalpollution and eutrophication and holds certain application value inurban sewage treatment (Zheng, 2018).Typha angustifolia possesses high medicinal value and a broadspectrum of biological activities, presenting abundant resources forthe discovery of promising drug candidates and the development ofnew plant supplements. However, current research on the activemetabolites and mechanisms of T. angustifolia is insufficient, with alack of mechanism-based pharmacological activity evaluation andin vitro and in vivo studies. Additionally, a systematic and effectivequality control system has not been established, leading to theunderutilization of its resources. Therefore, this paper reviews theresearch on T. angustifolia from various perspectives, includingbotany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activity,and quality control, by summarizing and discussing the researchstatus, application prospects, and limitations, aims to providetheoretical support and guidance for the comprehensivedevelopment and utilization of this important medicinalplant resource.2 Materials and methodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines for rigor and reproducibility, weconducted a systematic literature search with \u201cT. angustifolia\u201d as thecentral keyword, expanding it iteratively to include synonymousterms, related pharmacological applications, and therapeuticoutcomes. Boolean operators were used to combine search stringsfocusing on both plant identity and research scope. We examined awide range of academic sources from international databases such asPubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, CNKI and Baidu Scholar,and supplemented these with manual searches of the ChinesePharmacopoeia and historical texts. All publications in peerreviewed journals until December 2024 were considered.3 BotanyTypha angustifolia is a perennial botanical drugs, typically reachinga height of 1.5\u20133m. The rhizomes of the plant aremilky yellow in color.The stem is erect and stout in the aboveground portion, graduallytapering as it ascends. The leaves are strap-shaped,measuring 40\u201370 cmin length and 0.4\u20130.9 cm in width. They possess a smooth and hairlesssurface, and the upper part of the leaves is flat, while the lower part\u2019sabdomen is slightly concave. The back of the leaves gradually rises andprotrudes outward, resulting in a semicircular transverse section, thebase of the sheath expands and grows around the part of the stem. Theinflorescences are typically spaced around 2.5\u20136.9 cm apart, with themale inflorescencesmeasuring approximately 2.7\u20139.2 cm in length. Thecentral axis of the inflorescences is white, curved, and covered with softhairs. From the base of the inflorescences, there are 1-3 bracteolesslightly wider than the leaves. The lower part consists of the femaleflowers, measuring about 15\u201330 cm in length, with a bract also growingslightly wider than the leaf. The male flower is usually composed ofthree stamens, with anthers about 2 mm long and containing twochambers, and the overall shape is striped, with distinct nearly sphericalpollen grains. The filaments are short, and the flower is united at thebase into a short stalk, measuring about 2\u20133 mm in length. The stigmais spoon-shaped, curved outward, about 1.3\u20131.8 mm in length. Theovary is fusiform, exhibiting brown spots on the surface, andapproximately 1 mm in length. The stalk at the root of the ovary isthinner, about 5 mm in length. The sterile female ovary is 1\u20131.2 mmlong, conical in shape, with the uppermost portion yellowish brown andshort-pointed, displaying undeveloped stigmas; the base of the ovary isfrequently white, adorned with filamentous hairs that extend upward,slightly shorter than the stigma. The fruit type is a nut, the shape is oval,measuring approximately 1.5 mm in length. The pericarp has longbrown spots, and the seeds are dark brown, about 1\u20131.2 mm in length.The florescence of T. angustifolia is from June to August, and thefruiting period is from August to September (Zhang, 1998; StateAdministration of TCM of the PR China, 1999; Nanjing Universityof TCM, 2006).

Traditional Chinese Medicine extensively utilizes T.angustifolia in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, irregularmenstruation, abdominal pain, trauma bleeding, soft tissuecontusion, hematochezia, hematuria, and functional uterinebleeding (Nanjing University of TCM, 2006). Beyond its clinicalapplications, T. angustifolia also serves as a vital aquatic economicplant. Its leaf bases and rhizome apices are edible vegetables, while itsstems and leaves are utilized for weaving mats and other crafts, aswell as in paper manufacturing, the female flower can be employedas filling for pillow cores and cushions (Zhao and Xu, 2007).The first documented of T. angustifolia was in the Shen NongBen Cao Jing, the earliest Chinese treatise on materia medica whichover 1,900 years ago (Sun, 1963). It describes T. angustifolia as aChinese herbal medicine known for its diuretic, analgesic, andhemostatic effects. In the Tang Dynasty, the herbal book YaoXing Lun records that T. angustifolia had a prominenthemostatic effect and could be used to treat a variety of bleedingdiseases, including abnormal uterine bleeding, nasal mucosalbleeding and hematuria (Zhen, 2006). In the Classic MateriaMedica, Ri Hua Zi Ben Cao in the Song Dynasty, records that T.angustifolia can be used to treat epigastric pain, dysmenorrhea,irregular menstruation, uroschesisn and hematochezia (Ri, 2005).Ben Cao Gang Mu, a botanical monograph of the Ming Dynasty,records that T. angustifolia had a good analgesic effect, which couldbe used to relieve various types of pathologic pain, such as chestpain, heartache, stomachache and bellyache (Li, 1957). The sameperiod\u2019s Materia Medica Ben Cao Jing Shu also had a similar record,and it was believed that this analgesic effect of T. angustifolia mightbe related to its influence on the blood circulation system (Miao,2011). The traditional uses of T. angustifolia is more detailed in theMateria Medica classics of the Qing Dynasty. It is recorded in BenCao Chong Yuan that T. angustifolia can be used to treat a variety ofhemorrhagic diseases such as hematuria, traumatic bleeding anddigestive tract bleeding (Zhang, 1983). Notably, T. angustifolia iseffective in alleviating pain symptoms commonly associated withbleeding. Ben Cao Bei Yao was the first to suggest that thetherapeutic effect of T. angustifolia could be enhanced throughhigh-temperature roasting, and it also reported that T.FIGURE 1Typha angustifolia: (A) whole plant (B) inflorescences (C) stem and rhizome.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136TABLE 1 Traditional uses of Typha angustifolia.Dynasty of ancientChinaClassic medicabooksTraditional use ReferencesThe Eastern Han Dynasty (A.D. 184)Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing Used in the treatment of hypogastralgia, cystodynia, dysfunctional urination and bloodstasisSun (1963)The Tang Dynasty (A.

In addition, T.angustifolia also plays an important role in the treatment of somedigestive diseases, such as flatulence, digestive dysfunction andenteritis. This is confirmed by the relevant records in Ben CaoCong Xin and Ben Cao Bian Du (Wu, 2013; Zhang, 1936). Theancient Classic Medica books on T. angustifolia and their traditionaluses are shown in Table 1.Moreover, T. angustifolia is also a crucial component in over10 listed traditional Chinese medicine prescription preparations,including Jinggu Dieda pills, Fuke Zhixue Ling, Mo Luo dan andHexue Mingmu Pian. These formulations are utilized in treatingconditions such as soft tissue contusion, functional uterine bleeding,chronic atrophic gastritis, and fundus vascular diseases (Li and Xu,2018; Qi et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2023). All the formulated preparationof Traditional Chinese Medicine containing T. angustifolia and theirclinical applications are shown in Table 2.5 PhytochemistryTypha angustifolia contains a rich array of chemical metabolites,with 94 compounds having been isolated and identified thus far.These compounds include flavonoids (1\u201316), steroids (17\u201334),phenylpropanoids (35\u201343), Organic acid (44\u201357), volatile oil(58\u201379) and other compounds (80\u201394). Phytochemical studiesindicate that the most active metabolites are found in the pollenof T. angustifolia, with flavonoids being the predominantconstituent. The names, categories and corresponding structuresof these compounds are summarized in Table 3 and Figures 2\u20139.5.1 FlavonoidsFlavonoid compounds are abundant in T. angustifolia, and areconsidered as the basis of many pharmacological activities such asanti-inflammation, analgesia and anti-hyperlipidemic.

These compounds and their corresponding structures areshown in Table 3 and Figures 3, 4.5.3 PhenylpropanoidsThe phenylpropanoids in T. angustifolia are mainly divided intocoumarins and lignin, which exhibit distinct structuralcharacteristics. Coumarins are characterized by a benzene ringfused to an alpha-pyrone ring, while lignin compounds typicallyconsist of phenylpropane units linked by various types of bonds,forming a complex polymer structure. At present, nine compoundsFIGURE 2Structure of flavonoids from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136(35\u201343) have been isolated, which are respectively aulownin (35), 9-n-butyl-guaiacylglycerol (36), 9-n-butyl-isoguaiacylglycerol (37), 1-O-p-coumaroylglycerol (38), 1-O-di-p-coumaroylglycerol (39),Syringaresinol (40), Pinoresinol (41), Threo-2,3-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-methoxypropanol (42) and Erythro-2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-butoxypro pan-1-ol (43). TheseFIGURE 3Structure of steroids from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136compounds and their corresponding structures are shown in Table 3and Figure 5.5.4 Organic acidsAt present, fourteen organic acid compounds (44\u201357) wereisolated from T. angustifolia, predominantly consisting ofunsaturated organic acids and long-chain fatty acids. Thesecompounds are Palmitic Acid (44), Cerotinic acid (45),Octadecanoic acid (46), Vanillic acid (47), 4-Hydroxycinnamicacid (48), Ferulic acid (49), 4-Acetoxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid(50), Lauric acid (51), Typhic acid (52), Arachidonic acid (53),Pyruvic Acid (54), Citric Acid (55), Nicotinic acid (56) andProtocatechuic acid (57). These compounds, such as Ferulicacid (49) and Citric acid (55), have shown promising anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in recent studies,and also contribute to the diverse chemical composition of T.angustifolia, offering potential pharmaceutical applications invarious health conditions (Liu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2019).FIGURE 4Structure of Steroids from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136These compounds and their corresponding structures are shownin Table 3 and Figure 6.5.5 Volatile oilThe volatile oil content in T. angustifolia is relativelyabundant. Currently, 23 compounds were isolated andidentified from T. angustifolia, including Phenethyl senecioate(58), Tetrahydro-2-(12-pentadecynyloxy)-2H-pyran (59),Methyl benzoate (60), Methyl hydrocinnamate (61), 2, 4-di-tert-butylphenol (62), Methyl vanillate (63), Methylhexadecanoate (64), 1,1\u2032-bicyclohexy (65), Dimethyl adipate(66), Octanoic acid (67), Dimethyl azelate (68), Dimethylsebacate (69), Dimethyl undecanedioate (70), Methyl 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoate (71), Methyl vaccinate (72), 10-Octadecenoic acid (73), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (74),Diethyl phthalate (75), Dibutyl phthalate (76), DiisobutylFIGURE 5Structure of phenylpropanoids from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136phthalate (77), Dimethyl phthalate (78) and Phenyl phthalate(79). The volatile oil metabolite is crucial for evaluating T.angustifolia quality. Biological activity studies indicate thatmany of the aforementioned metabolites exhibit strongbiological activity. For example, Dimethyl phthalate (78) iscommonly used in mosquito repellent production due to itsexceptional adhesion and water resistance (Li et al., 2006).These compounds and their corresponding structures areshown in Table 3 and Figure 7.5.6 OthersTao et al. (2010) first reported two new cerebrosides in T.angustifolia, 1-O-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-(2S,3S,4R, 8Z)-2-[(2\u2032R)-2\u2032-ydroxytricosanoylamino]-8-nonadecene-3,4-diol (80)and 1-O-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-(2S,3R,4E, 8Z)-2-[(2\u2032R)-2\u2032-hydroxynonadecanoylamino]-4.13 -nonadecene-3-diol (81),and found that they could inhibited vascular smooth musclecell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, T.angustifolia also contains some aliphatic hydrocarbons andalkaloids, such as 6,21-Nonacosanediol (82), 6,10-Nonacosanediol (83), 6,8-Nonacosanediol (84), 1-Hexacosanol(85), Hexadecanol (86), Zarzissine (87), Choline (88), Allantoin(89), Adenine (90), Hypoxanthine (91), Uracil (92), 2.4(3H, 5H)-Pyrimidinedione (93), 2,3- Dihydroxypropyl hexadecanoate(94). These compounds and their corresponding structures areshown in Table 3 and Figure 8.6 Pharmacological activitiesGiven its extensive utilization in ethnopharmacologicalcontexts, T. angustifolia has garnered considerable attention fromresearchers. Over recent decades, investigations into thepharmacological activities of T. angustifolia have progressivelyunveiled its diverse therapeutic potentials, including but notlimited to anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-platelet aggregation,anti-atherosclerosis and anti-oxidative activities. Researchers havealso carried out some studies based on different in vivo and in vitrobiological models to confirm these pharmacological activities.Nonetheless, it is imperative to note that these studies have notelucidated the relationship between traditional medicinal usage andpharmacological efficacy comprehensively. Moreover, theassociation between bioactive metabolites and in vivomechanisms remains ambiguous, with scant attention paid topharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability. Detailedpharmacological activities and biological studies are shown inTable 4 and Figures 9, 10.6.1 Anti-inflammatoryThe total flavonoids of T. angustifolia exhibit inhibitoryeffects on the expression of IL-6 mRNA and the secretion ofprotein in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells cultured with palmiticacid. This inhibition contributes to the alleviation of skeletalmuscle inflammation and the amelioration of insulin resistanceFIGURE 6Structure of Organic acids from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136within the skeletal muscle, implying a potential mechanismlinked to the regulation of glucose transport efficiency and thesuppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Lou et al., 2008b). Furtherinvestigations into the anti-inflammatory properties of T.angustifolia have revealed that its total flavonoids candiminish the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the serum of typeFIGURE 7Structure of Volatile oil from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.15571362 diabetic rats induced by a high-fat diet and low-doseStreptozocin (Feng et al., 2014a). Additionally, theydownregulate the content of SOCS-3 by modulating the JAK/STAT pathway, thus mitigating chronic inflammation within thecirculatory system. Typha angustifolia also exhibited aninhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in vitro.This effect is significant as it reduces inflammation byinducing macrophage autophagy and inhibiting the secretionof the inflammatory factor IL-10 (Wang D. et al., 2017).Typha angustifolia can inhibit the damage of vascularendothelial cells induced by Ox-LDL, reduce the intercellularadhesion and inhibit the further occurrence of inflammatoryreaction by down-regulating the expression of IL-8 mRNA(Wang and Li, 2012). Liu et al. (2021) reported that T.angustifolia can suppress the inflammatory response by inhibitingthe expression of PARP1 and MAPK, consequently reducinglymphocyte infiltration and enhancing motor function in anacute spinal cord injury rat model. Zhang et al. (2013) used theFIGURE 8Structure of other compounds from Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136combination of immunogenic bovine serum albumin, CCl4 and LPSto induce a rat model of nephritis hematuria, and found that T.angustifolia could significantly reduce the number of malformed redblood cells in the urine of rats, the contents of urinary protein andcreatinine, and the value of serum urea nitrogen. It can increase theEndogenous creatinine clearance rate of serum total protein andendogenous creatinine clearance rate, and has a certain protectiveeffect on renal function. Another study also reported that T.angustifolia can effectively inhibit the expression of iNOS andCOX-2 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, and then downregulatethe content levels of inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1(Chen et al., 2021). Analysis of the active metabolites within T.angustifolia extracts indicated that organic acids and flavonoids mayconstitute its primary anti-inflammatory substance foundation. It isworth mentioning that T. angustifolia can also protect the blood-retinal barrier function by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokinessuch as TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1. This action reduces the excessiverelease of NO, thereby alleviating retinal inflammation and exertinga protective effect on retinal microangiopathy caused by diabetes(Yang et al., 2021).6.2 Analgesic effectResearchers observed the analgesic effect of T. angustifolia byplate method and writhing body method. They found that T.angustifolia significantly prolonged the number of foot lickingsand pain latency in mice, exerting a notable inhibitory effect onpain induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Interestingly, theanalgesic effect of T. angustifolia surpassed that of diclofenac sodiumin the positive drug group (Ge et al., 2002). Zhang et al. (2017)\u2019sstudy also confirmed this point, and further explored the effect of T.angustifolia on the regulation of pain perception in rats by usingpressure plate pain measurement method, and found that theanalgesic activity of T. angustifolia was dose-dependent, andbased on the solubility of active metabolites in different organicsolvents, it was speculated that flavonoids might be the main activemetabolites of T. angustifolia for analgesia. In addition, T.angustifolia also exhibited an inhibitory effect on inflammatorytoe pain induced by exogenous substances, significantlyprolonging the paw retraction latency in inflamed rats (Fu et al.,2017). In a study utilizing an LC-MS combined effect-directedfractionation strategy, two active metabolites, Isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidin (10) and Typhaneoside (16), were isolated andidentified from T. angustifolia. Both compounds demonstratedsignificant reductions in the number of body twists induced byacetic acid in mice, with inhibition rates of 54% and 51.8%,respectively (Zeng et al., 2019).6.3 Anti-platelet aggregationTypha angustifolia can inhibits platelet aggregation induced byADP, arachidonic acid, collagen, and other inducers in vitro, slowingdown the aggregation rate and depolymerizing the irreversibleplatelet aggregation, and this inhibitory effect is dose-dependent(Feng and Liu, 1999). Typha angustifolia can reduce theprothrombin time, thrombin time, activated partialthromboplastin time, and serum fibrinogen content in rats (Maet al., 2010). Additionally, further animal experiments revealed thatFIGURE 9Biological activity of Typha angustifolia L.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136TABLE 4 Pharmacological activities of Typha angustifolia.Activecomponents/PlantsourceExperimentalobject/MethodDose/DurationControl Results ReferencesPositive NegativeTotal flavonoids/DriedpollenC2C12 murine myoblasts/Invitro0.5 g/L/16 h ROS NA Total flavonoids of T.angustifolia can inhibitIL-6mRNA expressionand protein secretion ofC2C12 cells by inhibitingNF-\u03baB pathwayLou et al., 2008bTotal flavonoids/DriedpollenSD rats/In vivo 200 mg/kg/28 days Rosiglitazone NA Total flavonoids of T.angustifolia can reducethe expression of IL-6 andSOCS-3 in skeletal muscletissue, and improveinsulin sensitivityFeng et al.(2014a)Total flavonoids/DriedpollenRAW 264.7 cells/In vitro 0.3, 0.6,1.2 mg/kg/24 hNA NA T. angustifolia can inhibitthe activation of Akt/mTOR signal pathway,thus induce autophagy ofmacrophages and reduceinflammatory infiltrationWang et al.(2017a)Ethanol extract/Dried pollen Human umbilical veinendothelial cells/In vitro10, 50, 100 mg/L/24 hNA NA T. angustifolia can inhibitendothelial cell injuryinduced by low densitylipoprotein and reducethe expression of IL-8Wang and Li(2012)Water extract/Dried wholeplantSD rats/In vivo 1, 5, 10 g/kg/28 days NA Saline T. angustifolia can inhibitPARP1/MAPK signalpathway and its proteinexpression, and improvethe motor function of ratsLiu et al.

One study observedthe effects of T. angustifolia on hemorheology indexes in rats andfound that it could significantly reduce whole blood viscosity,enhance red blood cell deformations, and decrease aggregationwithout significantly affecting hematocrit in each dose group,indicating an improvement in blood circulation (Kong et al.,2011).

These flavonoidsimproved the elevation of rabbit whole blood viscosity inducedby a combination of adrenaline and ice bath, reduced the maximumplatelet aggregation rate, and shortened the maximumagglutination time.In addition to its influence on hemorheology, T. angustifolia canalso reduce the content of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 in the plasma ofblood stasis model rats, thus improving the platelet aggregation rateand inhibiting thrombosis (Shen et al., 2015). He et al. (2014)reported that T. angustifolia significantly inhibits the formationof thromboxemia in rats and has a protective effect on vascularendothelial cells. Building on this foundation, the anti-plateletaggregation activities of different organic solvent extracts of T.angustifolia were systematically screened, leading to thepreliminary confirmation that the active metabolites are enrichedin the ethyl acetate extract of T. angustifolia. Furthermore, variousanalysis methods based on network construction and genomics havealso been employed to study the anti-platelet aggregation activity ofT. angustifolia. For instance, Wang X. et al. (2017) evaluated T.angustifolia\u2018s anti-platelet aggregation activity using a high-throughput platelet aggregation experimental system in vitro.They discovered that T. angustifolia could decrease the level ofcalcium ions in platelets, potentially inhibiting platelet aggregationby activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway.6.4 Anti-atherosclerosisTypha angustifolia effectively reduces the formation anddevelopment of atherosclerotic plaques and diminishes the lesionarea through various mechanisms, including the reduction of bloodlipid levels, lipid accumulation, and promotion of endothelial cellproliferation. Its anti-atherosclerotic activity primarily involvedlipid reduction and endothelial cell protection.6.4.1 Reduced blood lipidsTypha angustifolia can promote the synthesis of prostacyclin(PGI2), reduce the production of lipid peroxides by vascularendothelial cells, reduce the levels of serum TC, LDL-C and TC/HDL-C by inhibiting intestinal absorption of exogenous cholesterol,and inhibit the increase of TXB2 content (Qiang et al., 1987; Zhanget al., 1987). In a variety of animal models, T. angustifolia showedsignificant activity in lowering blood lipids. Tao and Li (2004)reported that T. angustifolia could reduce the levels of totalcholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein in theserum of a hyperlipidemia rabbit model. While the levels of TCand TG in the plasma of the hyperlipidemia quail model decreased,the levels of endothelin and nitric oxide were not significantlyaffected. By enhancing the function of macrophages, T.angustifolia could reduce the hyperlipidemia induced by high-fatdiet, but had no effect on the elevation of ALT caused by high-fat(Reng et al., 1989; Zhou et al., 2006). Jiang and Huang (2009)induced hyperlipidemia model in rats by intraperitoneal injection ofvitamin D and high-fat diet, and found that T. angustifolia couldsignificantly reduce the content levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and NO inthe serum of rats. By down-regulating the expression of PERK-CHOP pathway, T. angustifolia also can inhibit endoplasmicreticulum stress and reduce cell apoptosis of aortic endothelialcells in atherosclerotic mice, and reduce the average area ofatherosclerotic lesions (Mo, 2019).Additionally, it has also been observed that T. angustifolia canprevent excessive accumulation of intracellular cholesterol andregulate the balance of total cholesterol in the body by up-regulating the expression of density lipoprotein receptor mRNA(Jiang et al., 2008). An in vitro study reported that total flavonoids ofT. angustifolia can reduce the secretion of free fatty acids in 3T3-L1adipocytes and regulate the lipid metabolism of the cells (He et al.,2006a). Further studies found that the lipid-lowering mechanism ofbulrushes involved down-regulating the expression of majortranscription factors in the fat formation pathway, which couldinhibit the transport, uptake, and synthesis of lipids by reducing thelevels of lipid metabolizing enzymes FABP4, LPL and FAS (He et al.,2008). Moreover, Typhaneoside (16), one of the active metabolitesof T. angustifolia, can dose-dependently improve non-alcoholic fattyliver disease induced by a high-fat diet in mice. This improvementoccurs through the activation of FXR expression, leading to areduction in lipid accumulation in the liver and white adiposetissue. This demonstrates the multifaceted lipid-loweringproperties of T. angustifolia and its active metabolites, presentingpotential therapeutic avenues for combating dyslipidemia-relatedconditions (Zheng et al., 2023).6.4.2 Endothelial cell protectionTypha angustifolia has demonstrated a significant protectiveeffect on endothelial cells in various in vivo animal experimentalmodels. It enhances prostaglandin synthesis in arterial endothelialcells of spontaneously hypertensive rats, reduces the concentrationof intracellular free calcium ions, improves transport efficiency, andpreserves endothelial cell function, thus significantly preventing theformation of atherosclerotic plaques (Qiang et al., 1987). Zhou et al.(2006) reported similar findings, indicating that T. angustifoliacould notably inhibit the formation of atherosclerotic lesions indyslipidemic quail. Additionally, it also inhibits the migration ofmacrophages and fibroblasts into the subintima, reduces theformation of lipostriated arteriosclerosis plaques in rabbitatherosclerotic models, and mitigates risk factors associated withendothelial cell injury (Tao and Li, 2004).Typha angustifolia can significantly reduce the plasma vWFcontent, increase the plasma NO content, enhance the endothelum-dependent relaxation response induced by acetylcholine andnorepinephrine induced contraction response of thoracic aorta. Ithas obvious protective effect on vascular endothelial injury causedby hyperlipidemia. This underscores its pronounced protectiveeffect against vascular endothelial injury caused byhyperlipidemia (Zhang et al., 2003). Additionally, T. angustifoliainhibits the upregulated expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 inhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein, leading to reduced LDH release, enhancedendothelial cell proliferation, and protection againstinflammation-induced vascular endothelial injury (Wang andHuang, 2010). Further investigation into its active compoundsrevealed that total flavonoids are among the primary activesubstances of T. angustifolia. These flavonoids exhibit protectiveeffects against endothelial cell damage induced by hypoxia,improving the activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cellsFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org21Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, they inhibit the production ofthe endogenous vasoactive factor, human endothelin-1 (ET-1), andregulate the balance of NO/ET-1 (Lin et al., 2011). By activating theautophagy pathway of macrophages, total flavonoids of T.angustifolia can reduce the degradation of extracellular matrixand inhibit the formation and development of plaque, suggestingthat the mechanismmay be related to the inhibition of the activationof PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Wang D. et al., 2017).6.5 Blood glucose modulationTypha angustifolia can enhance the glucose uptake andtransport capacity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependentmanner (He et al., 2006b). Lou et al. (2008a) reported that T.angustifolia improves palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance inC2C12 skeletal muscle cells. It increases cellular glucose utilizationefficiency and uptake capacity by upregulating glucose transporter(GLUT-4) expression. It can also upregulate the expression of Scrprotein and promote the formation of its signal complex, andincrease the glucose consumption level of skeletal muscle cells(Liu et al., 2014). Feng et al. (2012a) reported similar results, andfurther confirmed in vitro experiments that total flavonoids of T.angustifolia can improve skeletal muscle insulin resistance byincreasing the expression of \u03b2-arrestin-2 protein in cells. Fu et al.(2010) reported that total flavonoids from T. angustifolia canenhance the expression of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP-\u03b1 by promotingthe proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes, thusantagonizing the insulin resistance induced by fatty acids.Further studies showed that T. angustifolia can also improve fattyacid-induced islet beta cell damage, which may be related to thereduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the reduction ofproduction of oxidative stress products (Feng et al., 2015).6.6 Anti-oxidationWang et al. (2003) conducted an investigation using a rat modelof cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury to assess the protectiveeffects of T. angustifolia on brain tissue. The findings revealedthat T. angustifolia significantly elevated the activities of LDHand SOD in brain tissue while inhibiting lipid peroxidationdamage. Similarly, Jiang and Huang (2009) also corroboratedthese results in a rat model of atherosclerosis, demonstrating theantioxidant activity of T. angustifolia. This activity notably reducedthe content of MDA in rat serum and suppressed the production ofoxygen free radicals within the non-enzymatic system. Chen et al.(2006) reported that co-culturing T. angustifolia with rat nerve cellsmarkedly boosted the activities of GSH-Px and SODwithin the cells.This led to a reduction in MDA content and mitigated brain tissuelipid peroxidation damage induced by mercury, and it alsosignificantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity of nerve cellsfollowing mercury injury. Wang and Li (2010) confirmedthrough in vitro experiments using cultured human umbilicalvein endothelial cells that T. angustifolia can decrease LDH andMDA activities, increase SOD activity, and rectify endothelial celldysfunction induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.Furthermore, a comprehensive study evaluated the antioxidantactivity of various extracts of T. angustifolia. It was found thatboth ethanol extract and water extract had significant free radicalscavenging ability and antioxidant activity, which could significantlyreduce the content of MDA and NO in endothelial cells underoxidative stress, and increase the content of SOD (Chen et al., 2017).6.7 OthersQin et al. (2017) reported that T. angustifolia can inhibitprostatic hyperplasia induced by testosterone propionate andreduce serum testosterone levels. In a mouse model of prostatichyperplasia, Zhu et al. (2018) confirmed that T. angustifolia reducesthe expression of Ki67 and CD34 antigens in prostate tissue,inhibiting pathological hyperplasia of prostate cells and reducingthe aggregation of vascular endothelial cells. Typha angustifolia canenhance muscle tension, improve contractility, and prolong thecontractility of isolated uterine smooth muscle in late pregnancyrats. This effect can be inhibited by prostaglandin synthetaseinhibitors and calcium channel blockers, suggesting that theeffect of T. angustifolia on isolated uterine smooth muscleinvolves various regulatory pathways (Lai et al., 2016).Additionally, T. angustifolia significantly inhibits the calcificationof human vascular smooth muscle cells induced by ouabain. Itsmechanism involves the inhibition of the NKA-\u03b11 subunit and theblocking of the osteopontin signaling pathway (Lou et al., 2017).The water extract of T. angustifolia inhibits the growth of Lewislung cancer tumors in mice, increases serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1, arrests tumor cells in the G1 phase, and induces tumor cellapoptosis (Chen et al., 2008). Additionally, tetrazole salt assayresults demonstrate that T. angustifolia improves spleenlymphocyte proliferation in tumor-bearing mice (Li et al., 2011).Typha angustifolia exhibits a protective effect on retinal tissuelesions caused by hyperglycemia by down-regulating theexpression of VEGF and Ang-1 and improving fasting bloodglucose levels (Yang et al., 2021). Several studies have reportedthat T. angustifolia also mitigates brain tissue injury caused byischemic reperfusion, protecting neuronal function through theregulation of proteins such as HSP-70, Caspase-3, Parkin, andCyclin-E (Xia et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2009; Yuan and Xia, 2014).This inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and impact on mitochondrialautophagy suggest potential treatment avenues for ischemicencephalopathy and the development of novel therapeutics.7 Quality controlIn the 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the qualityevaluation method for Typha purpurea was standardized, withisorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidin and T. angustifolia serving asthe index metabolites for determining its content. However, thecurrent quality evaluation methods lack comprehensiveness, relyingsolely on two chemical metabolites as quality evaluation indicesweakens the correlation with drug activity. Furthermore, specificidentification methods and quantitative standards are lacking, it isnecessary to further establish a scientific and reasonable qualityevaluation model based on modern technology to guide theproduction, circulation, and use of T. angustifolia more effectively.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org22Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136At present, HPLC, HPCE, LC-MS/MS, GC-MS and other high-efficiency chromatography-mass spectrometry tools are often usedin the quality control research of T. angustifolia for qualitative andquantitative analysis of active metabolites. Wen et al. (2006)established the HPLC method for the determination of totalflavonoids content in T. angustifolia for the first time, andensured a good linear relationship between its index metabolites,with good repeatability and high recovery rate. Ma et al. (2014)optimized the extraction process of total flavonoids from T.angustifolia, elution and separation of total flavonoids withmacroporous resin, and further established a stable and simplepurification process. Zhang et al. (2019) established a method forsimultaneous determination of Isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidin(10) and Typhaneoside (16) in T. angustifolia. Compared withthe traditional method, the peak time is shorter and the twometabolites can be effectively separated. Ge and Jia (2011)established an LC-MS/PAD method for the detection ofAuramine O in T. angustifolia, which can effectively distinguishwhether the botanical drugs have been illegally stained.Fingerprints, multivariate statistical analysis andpharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicine are also widelyused in the process of identification and separation of indexmetabolites. For the first time, Lu et al. (2018) tested the contentof index metabolites in T. angustifolia at different mature stages, andthe results showed that the active metabolites were the highest in T.angustifolia picked in the half flowering stage. Based on the UPLCmethod, Tang et al. (2022) established the traditional Chinesemedicine fingerprint of T. angustifolia and the contentdetermination method of eight main metabolites. A total of15 common peaks were identified in the UPLC fingerprint, andthe similarity of different batches of medicinal materials was greaterthan 0.900. Li et al. (2015) simultaneously determined the totalcontent of five main index metabolites in 16 batches of T.angustifolia decoction pieces by HPLC, and established a qualitycharacterization and correlation analysis method based on this.A variety of emerging technologies play an important role in thequality control research of T. angustifolia and have made greatprogress in recent years, such as in vitro and in vivo quantitativestudies through the combination of multiple chromatographictechnologies, analysis of the enrichment mode of activesubstances based on metabolomics, and prediction of activesubstances through the establishment of network pharmacologicalmodels. In order to establish a scientific and sound qualityevaluation system, we still need to conduct in-depth analysis ofchemical information and pharmacodynamic results with statisticaldifferences on the basis of existing research, and find chemicalsubstances with high correlation with pharmacological activity toensure the safety and effectiveness of clinical use.8 ConclusionTypha angustifolia has a long history of application and is widelyused the treatment of dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation,abdominal pain, trauma bleeding, soft tissue contusion,hematochezia, hematuria, and other hemorrhagic diseases. It alsoserves as a resource-rich aquatic cash crop, finding extensiveapplications in medicine, weaving, papermaking, and the foodindustry. With its high medicinal value, economic potential, andbioavailability, it holds significant importance. Currently, we havereviewed the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry,pharmacological activities, and quality control of T. angustifolia.The paper then delves into future research directions and focalpoints, considering the following aspects:Numerous studies have confirmed that flavonoids serve as thefoundation for many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and lipid-lowering effects. Given theirpromising biological activity, the quest for novel flavonoidcompounds from T. angustifolia and exploring the correlationbetween their structural characteristics and efficacy representsignificant research endeavors and future focuses. However,current studies primarily focus on discovering and isolating newactive metabolites, often remaining at the stage of crude extractanalysis. Reports on potential biological activities of newcompounds are scarce. In addition, it is essential that futurestudies address current methodological limitations by adoptingstandardized bioassay protocols to rigorously validate thepharmacological efficacy of these compounds. Thus, conductingbioactivity-driven structure-activity studies on newly isolatedcompounds is crucial. This approach can elucidate the internalrelationship between active metabolites and pharmacologicalactivities, guiding future research directions on T. angustifolia\u2018sactive metabolites, and advancing the research and developmentof innovative drugs.Systematic research into the pharmacological activity of T.angustifolia is crucial for unlocking its medicinal potential. Thismedicinal plant exhibits various pharmacological activities,including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-platelet aggregation,anti-atherosclerosis, and anti-oxidation properties. However,existing studies have not delved deeply into the specific actionlinks and mechanisms of T. angustifolia in vivo, nor have theythoroughly explored its relationship with disease targets. The focusof traditional plant research is the rapid and accurate discovery ofpharmacological effector substances. However, the current study ofthe pharmacological active metabolites of T. angustifolia primarilyrevolves around extracts, particularly total flavonoid extracts, with anotable absence of in-depth exploration into monomer compounds.Moreover, future studies should critically address these limitationsby integrating advanced in vivo models and mechanistic analyses tovalidate pharmacological effects and elucidate disease targetinteractions. Therefore, it is necessary to further study thecorrelation between the pharmacological activities and chemicalmetabolites of T. angustifolia by combining related techniques suchas pharmacokinetics and network pharmacology. This will lead to amore comprehensive understanding of T. angustifolia\u2018s medicinalproperties and facilitate the development of novel therapeuticinterventions.Typha angustifolia has traditionally been utilized in treatinghemorrhagic diseases, particularly those stemming from localthrombosis and impaired blood microcirculation. This is maybeattributed to its anti-platelet aggregation activity, indicatingpotential for development as a novel antithrombotic drug.However, existing studies predominantly focus on T.angustifolia\u2018s effect on blood coagulation-related indices, withlimited exploration into its specific mechanism influencing bloodcoagulation function. Future studies should critically evaluate theseFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org23Liu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1557136mechanisms using comprehensive in vitro and in vivo models torigorously validate its antithrombotic potential. This underscoresthe need for robust clinical research validation and evidence tosupport traditional uses of T. angustifolia. Hence, we need to payattention to the role of traditional Chinese medicine theory inguiding the use and development of drugs. In order to betterdevelop and utilize the medicinal resources of T. angustifolia, it isnecessary to establish a close relationship with traditional medicalknowledge, and further strengthen the existing pharmacologicalactivity research on this basis.The quality control index of T. angustifolia is still relativelysimple, the identification of active metabolites is blind, and there isno comprehensive quality evaluation system. In the future research,based on the existing active metabolite data, combined with a varietyof emerging technologies, in-depth analysis of chemical informationand pharmacodynamics results with statistical differences should becarried out, further digging related quality markers and improvingthe quality evaluation system of T. angustifolia. In assessing thequality of medicinal materials comprehensively, it\u2019s essential toemphasize clinical relevance in terms of safety and effectiveness.Establishing an overall quality evaluation method should prioritizeactive metabolite content. Notably, T. angustifolia containsnumerous volatile metabolites, which may lose their activity dueto external factors like light, humidity, temperature, and oxidation.Hence, this requires us to further develop quality control methodsthat can monitor the production and content changes of extractsover time based on the fingerprint of existing compounds orfractions, so as to improve the stability of the quality ofmedicinal materials.In conclusion, T. angustifolia is a traditional medicinal plantwith considerable development potential and research value. It is ourhope that this paper can serve as a valuable reference for allresearchers interested in T. angustifolia.Author contributionsJL: Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization,Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review and editing.
