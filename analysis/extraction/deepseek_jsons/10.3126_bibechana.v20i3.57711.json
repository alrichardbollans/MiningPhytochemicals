The medicinalplant serves as a valuable and organic reservoir ofbioactive elements that play a significant role incontemporary medicine [3]. Various plant-derivednatural products, including alkaloids, phenols, andflavonoids, have been discovered with capabilitiesto induce apoptosis, and migration and exhibit po-tential against cancer, oxidation, diabetes, and in-flammation [2, 4]. Renewed interest and focus onmedicinal plant research have been triggered by therise in side effects, the emergence of new intestinalpathogens, and the increasing problem of microbialresistance [5].In this research, we examined the antioxidant,antibacterial, and alpha-amylase inhibition proper-ties of Berberis asiatica, a medicinal plant grownin Nepal belonging to the family Berberidaceae.Berberis plants of the Berberidaceae family are ex-tensively distributed across the globe, comprisingalmost 550 species [6]. Genus Berberis is globallyrecognized in traditional medicine for its potentmedicinal properties. Its roots and bark are em-ployed as antipyretic, anti-periodic, and diaphoretic[7]. Barberry fruits, due to their significant rich-ness in anthocyanin content, are consumed as anantidiabetic drug [8]. Among many species ofBerberis, Berberis asiatica is widely used in tra-ditional medicinal practices to cure diabetes andinfectious diseases [9].Berberis asiatica, commonly known as Chutro inNepali, is a wild shrub found in Nepal between ele-vations of 1200 to 2500 meters. It thrives in shaded,rocky slopes, north-facing hillsides, and drier re-gions. This erect, spiny shrub grows up to 4 meterstall, sporting yellow bark. Its leaves are simple, al-ternate, leathery, dark green on top, and grayishunderneath, usually with 2-5 spiny teeth along themargins. The shrub produces pale yellow flowers inflat-topped clusters and dark purple berries with asweet and sour taste [10, 11]. Traditionally, differ-ent parts of Berberis asiatica were used for medicalpurposes. Root and bark have extensive use in in-digenous medicine for treating various ailments, in-cluding eye and ear diseases, rheumatism, jaundice,diabetes, fever, stomach disorders, skin disease, andmalarial fever [9]. These root and stem bark areintegral to a renowned Ayurvedic medicine, con-taining several alkaloids such as berberine, palma-tine, jatrorrhizine, columbamine, berbamine, oxy-berberine, and oxyacanthine [12]. These secondarymetabolites play an important role in treating dif-ferent diseases and disorders in the human body.It was reported that berberine plays a vital role incontrolling diabetes by inhibiting digestive enzymesalpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase [13].Oxidation, a fundamental metabolic procedurepresent in all life forms, holds particular significancein humans as it underpins the production of energy.However, these biochemical reactions create freeradicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), po-tentially amplifying oxidative stress and causing po-tential harm to essential biological components likelipids, proteins, and DNA [14, 15]. As time passes,the harmful effects of ROS become more prominentand are associated with aging and age-related ill-nesses like heart diseases, cancer, brain disorders,diabetes, and other chronic diseases [16]. Further-more, diabetes represents a significant metabolicsyndrome with abnormally high blood glucose lev-els (hyperglycemia), and oxidative stress is closelyassociated with this condition, especially in indi-viduals with type 2 diabetes [17, 18]. Type 2 di-abetes mellitus is a multifaceted and diverse col-lection of metabolic disorders marked by increasedserum glucose levels, primarily resulting from defi-ciencies in both the function of insulin and its se-cretion [19]. Roughly, 90 to 95 % of diabetes casesare attributed to type 2 diabetes [20]. To manag-ing diabetes, one of the main approaches involvescontrolling postprandial hyperglycemia through theinhibition of the carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymealpha-amylase, responsible for breaking down long-chain carbohydrates like starch, amylase, and amy-lopectin into glucose, and another is by reducing ox-idative stress [14,20,21]. Hence, a novel and promis-ing drug is required in modern times to effectivelymanage diabetes and oxidative stress. As a result,there has been a concentrated effort to discovernovel antidiabetic compounds from plants utilizedin traditional medicine [22]. Furthermore, medic-inal plants offer a valuable source of antimicrobialagents [23]. Several plants belonging to Berberis arerenowned for their antibacterial properties [24, 25].Notably, Berberis asiatica has generated particu-lar attention as a source of novel compounds withremarkable antibacterial activity. Taking into ac-count the aforementioned factors, this study wasundertaken to explore the antioxidants, antibacte-rial, and \u03b1-amylase inhibition properties using invitro assays, aiming to contribute significant in-sights into the holistic understanding of Berberisasiatica.2 Materials and Methods2.1 ChemicalsAll chemicals and reagents utilized in thisstudy were of analytical grade. Gallic acid,Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 238Folin-Ciocalteu\u2019s reagent, quercetin, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), acarbose, \u03b1-amylasefrom porcine pancreases, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl--D-maltotrioside (CNPG3) were demanded fromSigma-Aldrich.2.2 Plant Collection and Preparation ofExtractThe whole plant of the Berberis asitica was col-lected from the Arghakhanchi district of Nepalgrowing at an altitude of 1810 m in October 2021based on ethnobotanical approaches. The plant wasverified in the National Herbarium and Plant Lab-oratories Godavari, Kathmandu, Nepal. To pre-pare the plant extract, freshly collected whole plantparts (leaves, bark, and roots) were washed withtap water to remove the contaminants, and the col-lected samples were dried and ground into a finepowder. For the extraction process, methanol wasused as a solvent. Due to high volatility, lower boil-ing point, and strong polarity, methanol is an idealchoice for the extraction process [26,27]. Moreover,methanol is renowned for its ability to yield higherextraction efficiency as compared to other solventsand its efficacy in extracting a diverse range of com-pounds, including antibacterial compounds, antiox-idants, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and ter-penoids [28\u201332]. Furthermore, methanol is cost-effective and readily available, making it an easilymanageable choice as a preferred extraction solvent.75 grams of powder was then mixed with 300 mLmethanol in a conical flask and meticulously shakento completely mix the powder in the solvent. Thenthe conical flask was covered with aluminum foiland left to undergo cold percolation for 72 hours atroom temperature. Subsequently, the mixture wasfiltered using a muslin cloth, and filtrate was col-lected in a beaker. This process was repeated forsubsequent 2 times to get a higher amount of the ex-tract. The filtrate was concentrated using a rotaryevaporator at a temperature of 400C, and concen-trated solution was kept in the water bath for fastevaporation of the solvent. The crude extract wasstored in the refrigerator at 4 0C for the subsequentevaluation of various biological activities, followingthe standard procedures.2.3 Phytochemical AnalysisThe recently prepared raw extracts of B. asiat-ica were subjected to qualitative tests to analyzethe presence or absence of various plant secondarymetabolites including alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids,terpenoids, reducing sugars, saponins, tannins, car-diac glycosides, anthraquinones. For qualitativephytochemical analysis, a series of tests were car-ried out according to the protocols of [33,34].2.4 Total Phenolic Content (TPC)To determine the TPC, the Folin-Ciocalteu phenolassay was employed [35,36]. The dry methanolic ex-tract was prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/mLin 30% DMSO. A sample (20 \u00b5L) of the plant ex-tract and a standard solution of gallic acid (rang-ing from 10 to 80 \u00b5g/mL) was mixed with Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (100 \u00b5L) and sodium car-bonate (80 \u00b5L). After a 30-minute incubation, theabsorbance was measured at 765 nm using a mi-croplate reader (Synergy LX, Bio-Tek, Instruments,Inc., USA). The TPC was calculated using a stan-dard curve and expressed as milligrams of gallic acidequivalent (mg GAE) per gram of plant extract.2.5 Total Flavonoid Content (TFC)To estimate the Total Flavonoid Content (TFC),the aluminum chloride (AlCl3) procedure was em-ployed [37]. A 20 \u00b5L of the stock solution of theplant extract and 130 \u00b5L of the standard quercetinsolution (ranging from 10 to 80 \u00b5g/mL) were loadedin 96-well plates. The standard quercetin solutionwas prepared by diluting a stock solution of 0.1mg/mL. Subsequently, to maintain the volume of110 \u00b5L, distilled water was added to the plant ex-tract in triplicate. Additionally, 60 \u00b5L ethanol, 5 \u00b5L10% AlCl3, and 5 \u00b5L potassium acetate were addedto each well. After a 30-minute incubation at roomtemperature, the absorbance was measured at 415nm using a microplate reader (Synergy LX, Bio-TekInstruments, Inc., USA). The TFC was calculatedusing a standard curve and expressed as milligramsof quercetin equivalent (mg QE) per gram of plantextract.2.6 Evaluation of Antioxidant ActivityTo evaluate the free radical scavenging activity,the DPPH radical scavenging assay was employed[38,39]. A solution of 0.1 mM DPPH was prepared,and a stock solution of quercetin was also prepared.Quercetin served as the positive control, while 50%DMSO was used as the negative control. The pos-itive control, negative control, and plant sampleswere loaded into separate wells of a 96-well platein triplicate. Subsequently, the DPPH reagent wasadded to each well, followed by a 30-minute incu-bation period in darkness. After incubation, theabsorbance at 517 nm was measured using a mi-croplate reader. Percentage inhibition of the testedsample was calculated using the following formula.%inhibition =[Abs. of control-Abs. of sample]Abs. of control\u00d7100Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 2392.7 \u03b1\u2212AmylaseInhibitionActivityTo assess the inhibitory activity of \u03b1-amylase, anin vitro assay was conducted using CNPG3 as thesubstrate [40]. Plant samples of various concentra-tions (20 L) were mixed with \u03b1-amylase (80 L at afinal concentration of 1.5 U/mL) and incubated at37 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. The reaction was initiated byadding 100 L of the substrate, CNPG3 (final con-centration of 0.5 mM), prepared in the buffer. Theexperiment was performed in a 50 mM phosphatebuffer. After incubation, the absorbance was mea-sured at 405 nm using a microplate reader. DMSO(30%) was used as the negative control, while acar-bose served as the standard. The inhibition per-centage was calculated using the provided formula.%inhibition =[Abs. of control-Abs. of sample]Abs. of control\u00d71002.8 Determination of Antibacterial Activ-ityThe antibacterial activity of the extract was eval-uated using the agar well diffusion method onMueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) plates [41]. Thetest organisms gram-positive Staphylococcus au-reus (ATCC 25293), and gram-negative bacteriaEscherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella Ty-phi (ATCC 14028), and Klebsiella pneumoniae(ATCC 13883) were cultured in Mueller-Hintonbroth. These tested bacteria Staphylococcus au-reus and Escherichia coli were obtained from clini-cal isolation whereas Salmonella typhi was isolatedfrom the liver of the four-week-old chicken. Thesecultured bacteria were incubated at 37 0C untilthe turbidity reached a standardized 0.5 McFarlandunit. The MHA plates were then uniformly inoc-ulated with the microbial suspension. A stock so-lution of the plant extract at a concentration of 5mg/mL was prepared. Using a sterile cork borerwith an 8 mm diameter, three wells were createdon the agar surface. Each well was filled with 50\u00b5L of the plant extract, along with a positive con-trol consisting of neomycin at a concentration of1 mg/mL, and a negative control consisting of 50%DMSO. These controls were included on each plate.After allowing approximately 15 minutes for the ex-tracts and controls to diffuse into the agar at roomtemperature, the plates were incubated at 370C for18-24 hours. Following the incubation period, theplates were examined for the presence of clear zonesof inhibition (ZOI) surrounding the wells. The di-ameter of the ZOI was measured in millimeters us-ing a ruler, providing a quantitative assessment ofthe antimicrobial activity of the plant extract.2.9 Determination of Minimum InhibitoryConcentration (MIC)Determination of the minimum inhibitory con-centration (MIC), which represents the smallestamount of compounds needed to inhibit or kill mi-croorganisms in vitro, can be achieved through thebroth microdilution method [42]. In this method,the methanolic extract of the plant exhibiting sig-nificant antibacterial activity was subjected to atwo-fold serial dilution. Under aseptic conditions,a sterile 96-well plate was filled with 100 \u00b5L ofMueller Hinton broth in each well. The extractwas double diluted by adding equal volumes (100\u00b5l) of the extract to MHB to get a series of concen-trations ranging from 25 mg/mL to 0.012 mg/mLin plates. Next, 5 \u00b5L of the prepared bacterial in-oculums adjusted to 0.5 McFarland Standard wasadded in each dilution. The microplate was incu-bated at 37 oC for 12 to 18 hours. After incubation,10 \u00b5L of a 0.003% resazurin solution was added towells, followed by an additional incubation period of2 to 3 hours. Any color change from purple/blue topink or colorless was recorded as a positive result.In this test neomycin solution was taken as posi-tive control and DMSO solution was placed as neg-ative control. The MIC value was determined as thelowest concentration at which no color change oc-curred, indicating the inhibition of bacterial growthby the plant extract.2.10 Determination of Minimum Bacteri-cidal Concentration (MBC)MBC was determined by subculturing the MIC cul-tures on suitable agar plates. The sterile nutrientagar plate was taken in which solution from themicroplate was loaded by streaking with the helpof an inoculating loop. The solutions of the wellshowing MIC value and above were loaded in theplate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00baC for 18-24hours. Then plates were examined for the growth ofmicroorganisms. The tubes with a minimum con-centration of extract in which the growth was com-pletely checked were noted as the MBC of the plantextract [10]. MBC is complimentary to MIC and itis the lowest concentration of antibacterial agentthat has a reducing capacity of viability of initialbacterial inoculum up to 99.9%.2.11 GC-MS Profiling of Chemical Com-poundsIn this study, for the chemical characterization hex-ane fraction was fractionated from the methano-lic extract and this fraction was analyzed us-ing Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) with an Agilent 7890 GC instrument and anKeshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 240Agilent 5975C inert MSD with Triple-Axis Detec-tor. The analysis employed a gas carrier of heliumat a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The sample injectionvolume was set at 2 \u00b5L, and the temperature pro-gram consisted of an initial temperature of 320C,followed by a ramping rate of 50C/min up to 2300C,with a final hold time of 15 minutes. The aux-iliary heater was set to 2300C to ensure optimalconditions for efficient analysis. These carefully op-timized analytical conditions provided valuable in-sights into the chemical composition of the hexanefraction, facilitating the identification and quantifi-cation of its compounds. These findings enhanceour understanding of the chemical profile of B. asi-atica and its potential therapeutic applications.2.12 Statistical AnalysisAll the experiments were performed in triplicateand data were presented in \u00b1 standard error of themean. The TPC, TFC, antioxidant assay, and en-zyme inhibition were calculated by Microsoft Excel2007. The IC50 value was calculated using Graph-Pad Prism software.3 Results and Discussion3.1 Percentage YieldThe percentage yield was calculated to measure theabundance of secondary metabolites in the wholeplant sample used in the study. The percentageyield of B. asiatica was found 10.66%, which isshown in Table 1.3.2 Phytochemical Screening of Crude Ex-tractPreliminary phytochemical analysis was performedfor the analysis of the presence and absence of differ-ent secondary metabolites. The result of the phy-tochemical screening of the methanolic extract ofBerberis asiatica is shown in Table 2.3.3 Total Phenolic and Flavonoid ContentThe total phenolic content (TPC) and totalflavonoid content (TFC) were estimated by con-structing a calibration curve taking different con-centrations of gallic acid and quercetin, againstthe absorbance. TPC was expressed as milligramsof gallic acid equivalent per gram (mg GAE/g),while TFC was expressed as milligrams of quercetinequivalent per gram (mg QE/g). The total pheno-lic content of the methanolic extract of B. asiaticawas determined to be 37.686 \u00b1 2.728 mg GAE/g,while the total flavonoid content was estimated as115.568 \u00b1 8.012 mg QE/g.3.4 Antioxidant PotentialAt a concentration of 1000 g/mL, the crude extractsof B. asiatica demonstrated significant inhibitoryactivity of 89.588% against the DPPH free radical.As a result, further dilution of the samples was per-formed to determine the IC50 value. The methano-lic extract of B. asiatica exhibited noteworthy rad-ical scavenging activity, with an IC50 value of 205.7\u00b1 5.353 g/mL. This result was compared to the IC50value of the standard quercetin, which was found tobe 6.29 \u00b1 1.02 g/mL.Table 1: Physical characteristics and percentage yield of plant extract.Plant Color of Extract Weight of Dry Sample (g) Weight of Extract (g)B. asiatica Yellow 75 8Table 2: Phytochemical screening of whole plant extract.Phytochemicals Methanolic extract of Berberis asiaticaAlkaloids +Flavonoids +Tannins -Saponins +Terpenoids +Steroids +Glycosides +Reducing sugars +Coumarins +Polyphenols +Volatile oils -where + represents the presence of metabolites and - represents absence.Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 241Table 3: Total phenolic and flavonoid content in methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica.Whole Plant Extracts TPC (mg GAE/g) TFC (mg QE/g)Berberis asiatica 37.686 \u00b1 2.728 115.568 \u00b1 8.0123.5 In Vitro \u03b1-Amylase Inhibition Activ-ityThe crude methanolic extracts of B. asiatica ex-hibited an inhibitory activity of 37.732% against \u03b1-amylase at a concentration of 500 g/mL. Therefore,additional dilution of the samples was not carriedout to determine the IC50 value. According to theliterature, it has been observed that plants containsecondary metabolites that possess properties sim-ilar to metformin, which are known to aid in thecontrol of diabetes [43].3.6 Antibacterial ActivityThe methanolic extract of B. asiatica, at a concen-tration of 50 mg/mL, exhibited varying inhibitoryeffects against different bacteria. Against S. aureus,moderate inhibitory activity was observed, with azone of inhibition measuring 14 mm. However, noinhibitory effect was detected against E. coli andS. typhi. In contrast, the extract displayed a stronginhibitory activity against K. pneumoniae, as ev-idenced by a substantial zone of inhibition mea-suring 19 mm. These results indicate that themethanolic extract of B. asiatica possesses antibac-terial properties, particularly against S. aureus andK. pneumoniae while showing no inhibitory effecton E. coli and S. typhi.3.7 Minimum Inhibitory ConcentrationThe methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica demon-strated significant antibacterial activity against twotypes of bacteria, namely S. aureus (gram-positive)and K. pneumoniae (gram-negative). To determinethe potency of the extract in inhibiting the growthof these microorganisms in vitro, the Minimum In-hibitory Concentration (MIC) values were deter-mined using the two-fold serial broth microdilutionmethod. MIC is expressed in terms of mg/mL. TheMIC shown by the methanolic extract of Berberisasiatica and the standard antibiotic neomycin (pos-itive control) against the test bacteria are summa-rized in Table 6.The results indicate that the methanolic extractof Berberis asiatica exhibited excellent inhibitoryactivity against S. aureus, with a MIC value of0.39 mg/mL. Although the methanolic extract alsodemonstrated inhibitory activity against K. pneu-moniae, it was less potent than the positive controlNeomycin. The MIC value for K. pneumoniae was3.125 mg/mL for the plant extract, whereas it was0.0019 mg/mL for Neomycin.3.8 Minimum Bactericidal ConcentrationMBC is the lowest concentration of antibacterialagent that has a reducing capacity of viability of ini-tial bacterial inoculum up to 99.9%. MBC is com-plimentary to MIC. Methanolic extract of Berberisasiatica exhibited minimum bactericidal concentra-tion for S. aureus was 6.25 mg/mL and for K. pneu-moniae was 6.25 mg/mL. The results showed thatthe plant extract exhibited the same MBC for S.aureus and K. pneumoniae.3.9 Chemical Constituents Profiling byGC-MS AnalysisThe GC-MS analysis of the hexane extract ofBerberis asiatica revealed the presence of 35 com-pounds. The GC-MS chromatogram is shown inFigure 2. The NIST08 MS library was employedto compare and identify the chemical constituents.These compounds consist of ketones, alkanes, cy-cloalkanes, alcohol, and amines along with aromaticcompounds. The profiling of chemical compoundsin the hexane extract of asiatica with their reten-tion time (RT), molecular weight (MW), and rel-ative area percentage (%) are presented in Table8.Table 4: Antioxidant (IC50 ) of methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica and standard quercetin.Samples IC50 (\u00b5g/mL)Berberis asiatica 205.7 \u00b1 5.353Quercetin (Standard) 6.29 \u00b1 1.02Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 242Figure 1: Antibacterial activity, MIC, and MBC determination of plant extract.Figure 2: GC-MS chromatogram of hexane fraction of Berberis asiatica.3.10 Pharmacological Importance of GC-MS Detected CompoundsAmong the detected compounds by GC-MS, someof those compounds having the alcohol and ke-tone functional groups have been reported to pos-sess pharmaceutical significance owing to their bi-ological activities. The compound 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-hexanone is reported to have poten-tial therapeutic effects such as antioxidant, an-timicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-cancer, and also effective against Alzheimer\u2019s dis-ease.. The compound 2-methyl-2-pentanol has beendemonstrated to induce apoptosis in cancer cells,enhance the immune response to viral infections,and exhibit antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviralactivity. The compound 4-methyl-2-pentanol hasbeen reported to act as an acetylcholinesterase in-hibitor and demonstrate antibacterial and antifun-gal properties. Furthermore, it has shown effective-ness in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease andother neurological disorders. Other identified com-pounds like 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol and 3-hexanolalso demonstrated antifungal, antibacterial, and an-titumor activities [44]. The compound 3-hexanolcan serve as an agonist for the GABA-A recep-tor, which plays a role in regulating neurotransmit-ters in the brain. Meanwhile, in vitro studies of2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol have shown that this com-pound can inhibit the growth of various cancer celllines, including those associated with breast, lung,and colon cancers [44]. The chemical profiling ofthe present study reported that the plant B. asi-atica is the source of potential natural compoundsthat could be used in treating different diseases.4 DiscussionA limited number of studies have been conducted toexplore the bioactive metabolites of plants in Nepal.Being a landlocked country, Nepal boasts remark-able biodiversity in its flora, resulting in a high den-Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 243Figure 3: Structures of some chemical compounds detected from GC-MS analysis of hexane fraction ofBerberis asiatica.Table 5: Zone of Inhibition shown by methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica against bacterial strain.Bacterial strain Zone of inhibition (mm) of plant extract Zone of inhibition (mm) of positive controlS. aureus 14 13E. coli - 16K. pneumoniae 19 18S. typhi - 15sity and diversity of plant species. For this research,various readily available Berberis species were col-lected and confirmed to be Berberis asiatica . Theprimary objective of this study was to evaluate theinhibitory effects of Berberis asiatica on \u03b1-amylase,various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacte-ria, as well as the antioxidant properties of plants.In earlier investigations, the methanolic extract ofBerberis asiatica exhibited a percentage yield of6.8% [10]. However, in the current study, the per-centage yield was found to be higher at 10.66%. Thevariation in secondary metabolites abundance canbe ascribed to the distribution of the selected plantacross different geographical locations, thereby af-fecting its overall availability of these compounds.In the previous study, the total phenolic con-tent (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) wereexamined in different parts of Berberis asiatica ,including leaves, bark, and roots. The TPC val-ues were recorded as 132.63 mg GAE/g, 52.240 \u00b10.119 mg/100g, and 59.076 \u00b1 0.219 mg/100g forleaves, bark, and roots, respectively [45]. Similarly,the TFC was found to be 31.36 mg QE/g, 1.735\u00b1 0.396 mg QE/g, and 1.576 \u00b1 0.197 mg QE/gfor leaves, bark, and roots, respectively [45]. Inthe present study, a notable difference in TPC andTFC was observed in Berberis asiatica comparedto the previously reported results. The TPC valuefor this plant was reported as 37.686 \u00b1 2.728 mgGAE/g, and the TFC was recorded as 115.568 \u00b18.012 mg QE/g. The plant sample collected in thepresent study showed higher contents of secondarymetabolites which impart a significant effect on thebiological activity, particularly in terms of antioxi-dant and antidiabetic properties.In previous research, the antioxidant activityof Berberis asiatica was investigated, and the IC50value for the root and stem bark extracts was de-termined to be 102.31 and 120.7 \u00b5g/mL, respec-tively [46]. However, in the current study, a no-table difference was observed, showing a significantradical scavenging activity with an IC50 of 205.7\u00b1 5.353 \u00b5g/mL. The variation in the IC50 valueof Berberis asiatica indicates that the antioxidantpotential can be influenced by multiple factors, in-cluding the extraction methods, a sample collectedgeographical area, and the timing of sample col-lection. Apart from exhibiting poor inhibition ofKeshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 244Table 6: Minimum inhibitory concentration of methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica against test bac-teria.Bacteria Berberis asiatica MIC (mg/mL) Positive control (Neomycin) MIC (mg/mL)S. aureus 0.39 0.0039K. pneumoniae 3.125 0.0019Table 7: Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica againsttest bacteria.Bacterial strain Berberis asiatica MBC (mg/mL) Positive control (Neomycin) MBC (mg/mL)S. aureus 6.25 0.015K. pneumoniae 6.25 0.0078alpha-amylase in the current study, Berberis asi-atica is well-documented in some literature for itsanti-diabetic properties. Previous research suggeststhat the plant\u2019s blood glucose and lipid regulatoryeffects can be attributed to berberine, a significantalkaloid present in Berberis asiatica . This com-pound has been found to enhance insulin sensitivityby regulating the secretion of adipokines [47].The results of the current study demonstratethat the methanolic extract of Berberis asiatica ex-hibited significant inhibition in the growth of twobacterial strains, one gram-positive (S. aureus) andone gram-negative (K. pneumoniae), with a zoneof inhibition (ZOI) of 14 mm and 19 mm, re-spectively. This finding indicates that the plantextract possesses potent antibacterial properties,likely due to the presence of specific antibacte-rial agents. However, in the previous study, thecrude aqueous extract of Berberis asiatica stembark demonstrated a zone of inhibition in the diskdiffusion method. Among the Gram-negative bac-teria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, andSalmonella paratyphi-A exhibited a zone of inhi-bition of 8 mm [48]. This outcome suggests thatour study has exhibited a notably robust antibac-terial property when compared to the previous re-search. The results of the current study revealedthat the methanolic extract of B. asiatica displayeda minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.39mg/mL for S. aureus and 3.125 mg/mL for K.pneumoniae. Notably, the plant extract demon-strated better inhibition for S. aureus compared toK. pneumoniae. The literature also reported sim-ilar findings, where the methanolic stem bark ex-tract of Berberis asiatica exhibited a MIC of 312.5\u00b5g/mL for S. aureus [10], which aligns with theMIC value obtained in the present study. How-ever, for K. pneumoniae, the aqueous stem barkextract of Berberis asiatica reported in the liter-ature exhibited a MIC of 2500 \u00b5g/mL, which ishigher than the MIC value obtained in the presentstudy [48]. Furthermore, the methanolic extractof the Berberis asiatica plant exhibited an MBCof 6.25 mg/mL for both S. aureus and K. pneumo-niae, indicating the same bactericidal concentrationfor both bacterial strains. In comparison, the litera-ture reported a methanolic stem bark extract withan MBC of 0.78125 mg/mL for S. aureus, whichdiffers and shows the potential activity of the plantsample used in this study [10]. The difference in thebiological activities and the richness of secondarymetabolites in the plant may be attributed to thepart of the plant sample used and the geographicalvariation of plant growth.In the chemical profiling, different secondarymetabolites were identified by GC-MS analy-sis which includes, 3,3-dimethylpentane, cyclo-hexane, 2-methylhexane, 3-methylhexane, 1,3-dimethylcyclopentane, 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane,Heptane, methylcyclohexane, 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol, 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-hexanone, 3-hexanol. The previousstudy reported some of the compounds like berber-ine, palmatine, jatrorrhirine, oxyacanthine, oxyber-berine, tetrahydropalmatine, and columbamine [7].The GC-MS profiling in this study shows somedifferent compounds with a richness of bioactivecompounds like alkaloids, phenolic, and flavonoidcompounds highlighting the pharmaceutical poten-tial of the plant and may be a good source of suchcompounds in the future drug development process.The abundance of secondary metabolites may beaffected due to climatic conditions, soil type, tem-perature, and geographical locations [49]. Althoughthe same plant species with nearby environmentalconditions may vary in chemical compositions [50].Increasing the altitude contribute significantly tochemical composition, at higher altitude plant pos-sess a higher amount of phenolic and flavonoid com-pounds [41]. However, at lower altitudes, there isa greater abundance of volatile organic compoundsin the plants [41]. These variations in chemicalcomposition according to altitude can be ascribedto discrepancies in the biological activity of plantextract. Therefore, current research results showsome different potential results as compared to theprevious one.Keshab Bhattarai et al./ BIBECHANA 20 (2023) 236-247 245Table 8: Major chemical compounds detected by GC analysis in hexane fraction.S.N.

The plant extract demon-strated significant inhibition of \u03b1-amylase and ex-hibited potent antibacterial activity against bothgram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (K.pneumoniae) bacteria. Additionally, the extractshowed promising antioxidant potential. More-over, there were variations in the total phenolicand flavonoid content of the plant when comparedto previous findings. These differences could beattributed to various factors, such as plant partsused, extraction methods, and environmental con-ditions. Chemical profiling revealed the presenceof various secondary metabolites in the plant, andsome of these compounds were also reported in theliterature, further confirming the plant\u2019s potentialmedicinal value. This study highlights the rich bio-diversity of Nepal\u2019s flora and the importance of ex-ploring and understanding the bioactive propertiesof its plant species. Berberis asiatica emerges asa promising candidate for further research and de-velopment of natural remedies and pharmaceuticalagents, particularly for its antidiabetic, antibacte-rial, and antioxidant properties. However, futureresearch should prioritize the bioassay-guided isola-tion of target bioactive compounds using advancedtechniques like LC-HRMS, HPLC, and NMR. Isola-tion, purification, and identification of potent bioac-tive components bearing antioxidant, antidiabetic,and antibacterial properties followed by in vitro andin vivo studies to unveil their mechanisms of actionwill confirm their potential for inclusion in upcom-ing drug discovery initiatives.References[1] N.
