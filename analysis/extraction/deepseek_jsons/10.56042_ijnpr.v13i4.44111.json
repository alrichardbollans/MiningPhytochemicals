They are possible source of new potential antibiotics to which pathogenic organisms are not tolerant1. The plant based traditional medicinal systems plays an important role in curing health and about 80% people of the world use traditional medicines for their primary health care2. Medicinal plants relevant to ethnomedicinal knowledge has been proved an important guiding tool for research in the area of new drug development3. Medicinal plants fulfill the need of millions of ethnic and indigenous people living in tribal and rural region. According to the data provided by Ministry of Environments and Forest and Climate Change Government of India, tribal communities in India use over 10,000 plant species for their primary health care4,5. India is very rich in natural resources and the knowledge of traditional medicine. There has been increasing interest of plant uses and the identification of their components with antimicrobial properties. The development of resistance in microorganisms to antibiotics and emergence of new infectious diseases create an urgent need to discover, novel, safe and effective antimicrobial drugs6. Although few plant species have been tested for antimicrobial properties, the majority of these have not been adequately evaluated7. The available literature showed that among 250,000-500,000 plant species, only a small fraction has been investigated phytochemically and a very small percentage submitted to pharmacological screening8. Keeping in mind the vast potentiality of ethnobotanically known invasive plant Sonchus asper (L.) Hill is reviewed for pharmacology.

Taxonomic status11 Kingdom: Plantae; Phylum: Tracheophyta; Class: Magnoliopsida; Order: Asterales; Family: Asteraceae: Genus: Sonchus (L.); Species: asper (L.). Geographic distribution S. asper is commonly known as Spiny sow thistle. This plant is native of North Africa, Europe and west Asia. The Plant of S. asper has been widely distributed in the countries viz, North America, South Africa, South America, New Zealand, Australia, East Asia, Germany, France, Poland, Austria, Belgium, India, Greece, and Iran12. Ethnobotanical significance S. asper has various traditional uses. The plant has been used as a tonic to purify blood and is applied on fresh injuries on wounds, cough bronchitis, and asthma13. It has been also used to treat ailments related with kidney and liver14. The roots and leaves of this plant are used in the treatment of indigestion and as a febrifuge. Its stem is used as a sedative and tonic15. Some species of Sonchus viz, S.asper, S. oleraceus and S. arvensis are regarded as sources of dietary fibre and vitamins and chiefly contribute to the food security approach of many people16-18. Pharmacological activities The plant of S. asper (L.) has numerous medicinal uses15. Some important pharmacological activity reported for this plant are reviewed here under. Antibacterial activity The methanol and aqueous extract of S. asper leaf have been reported to show antibacterial activity against the pathogens tested viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Klebciella pneumonae. However result showed more inhibitory activity against gram positive bacteria as compared to Gram negative once12. The essential oil of S. asper possess good antimicrobial activity19,20. The different solvent extract (Methanol, chloroform, hexane) of S. asper were screened for antibacterial activity against Micrococcus sp., S. aureus, Shigella flexineri and E. coli by agar well diffusion method. The result showed that the methanol extract of this plant was more active against S. aureus as compared to other pathogens tested21. The antibacterial activity of different solvent extract (various fractions) of S. asper were evaluated against E. coli, B. subtilis, M. luteus, K. pneumonae, S. aureus and P. areuginosa. The result showed that the methanol extract represent good antibacterial potential22. Methanol, acetone and aqueous extract of S. asper and S. oleraraceous leaves were screened for antibacterial potential against 5 Gram-positive and 5 Gram-negative bacteria. The result revealed that the both plant extracts were active against Gram-positive strains and less towards Gram-negative strains23. This study also supports the facts that, in general the Gram-negative bacteria are less susceptible to antibacterial effects than the Gram-positive bacteria24,25. Antifungal potential The antifungal potential of methanol and aqueous extract of S. asper leaves was evaluated against fungal pathogens viz., Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus. The result showed that both fungal pathogens were resistant to both methanol and aqueous extract12. Different solvent and various fractions extracts of this plant were screened against 4 strains of fungi. The study showed that all the extract of all fractions of this plant exhibit antifungal activity to some extent at 200 \u00b5g/mL. However, methanol and ethyl acetate extract showed marked inhibition against A. niger, Fig. 1 \u2014 Sonchus asper (L.) Hill in flowering state. TRIPATHI et al.: REVIEW ON ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY PROPERTIES OF SONCHUS ASPER while butanol, methanol, and aqueous extract showed inhibition against fungi F. solani22. The screening of antifungal activity of aerial part of S. asper at various concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5%) were made against fungi Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani. The results revealed that all the applied concentrations of tested extracts showed significant antifungal potential up to 37-74%26. Antioxidant potential The screening of the antioxidant potential of different solvent (Methanol, n- hexane, chloroform) extracts of S. asper were carried out by DPPH \u2013 radical scavenging essay. The result reported that in all the solvent extract applied methanol extract showed significant antioxidant potential21. In an study it was revealed that the antioxidant potential of S. asper is due to the presence of various flavonoids contents and phenolic compounds as well15. Different solvent (Ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane and methanol) extracts of this plant were evaluated for phenol contents and antioxidant potential by DPPH, ABTS and H2O2 radical scavenging essay. The biochemical investigation showed that presence of phenol compounds in methanol extract of this plant might be responsible for DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging capacities and reducing power27. The antioxidant potential of different solvent viz, 70% MeOH, 70% EtOH and hot water extracts of another species of Sonchus i,e, S. oleraceus were evaluated. The result revealed that the boiling water extract, 70% MeOH % and 70% EtOH extracts had stronger antioxidant activities from 47.1 to 56.5 \u00b5g/mL28. Phytochemical studies In an experiment, it was reported that the most important bioactive components of Sonchus species were sesquiterpene, lactone, quinic acid esters, flavonoids, glycerate, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins and saccharides29. In another study, the Sonchus species were found to contain high levels of potassium, sodium, copper, calcium, manganese, zinc, and phosphorus. It was also shown that the species of Sonchus contain abundant fatty acids, viz, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which was an important fatty acids and are reported in large scale (41.6%) in S. asper30. The carotenoid content of Sonchus species range from 158 to 240 mg/kg30,31. The chemical composition analysis of S. eruca and S. asper revealed that the bioactive compounds present in both the species comprises as \u2013 alkaloids (1.24\u20131.34 mg/100 g), saponins (1.46\u20131.76 mg/100 g), flavonoids (1.61\u20131.34 mg/100 g), phenols (1.32\u20131.44 mg/100 g), and tannins ( 0.02\u20130.061 mg/100 g)15. It was also suggested that the plant of S. asper contains rich quantity of vitamin C (33.2\u201322.12 mg/100 g), fiber, calcium, manganese, zinc, iron, and copper. In addition, it also bears leutiolin, leuteolin \u2013 7 \u2013 o \u2013 \u03b2 \u2013 D glucoside, apigenin \u2013 7 \u2013 o \u2013 \u03b2 \u2013 D glucopyranuronide, apigenin \u2013 7 \u2013 o \u2013 \u03b2 \u2013 D glucoronide methyl ester, germanicyl acetate, and apigenin \u2013 7 \u2013 o \u2013 \u03b2 \u2013 D glucoronide ethyl ester. The same study also reported the presence of riboflavin (0.24\u20130.72 mg/100 g), thiamine (0.31\u20130.15 mg/100 g) and niacin (0.03\u20130.05 mg/100 g) from the whole plant extract of S. asper15. Insecticidal potential Ethanol and aqueous extract of S. asper leaf and root exhibit insecticidal activity at 1000 \u00b5g/mL. However, at the same concentration ethanol leaf extract is more potent as compare to aqueous extract32. Anti\u2013inflammatory potential The evaluation of anti-inflammatory potential of hydroalcohol leaf extract of S. asper and one of its major constituent, apigenin- 7 glucoside (Ap 7 G) in male mice have revealed that in tail flick, writhing and glutamate\u2013induced paw licking tests, application of a dose of 300 mg/kg of extract exhibit significant (P <0.01) anticoncicpetive effect compared to the control group33. In formaline test, treatment with a dose of 100 mg/kg of extract reduced the pain source in the tonic phase compared with the control group (P <0.05). In formaline model, also naloxone (an opioid non selective antagonist) plus the extract (300 mg/kg) reduced liking and biting in mice. This study clearly demonstrate that the hydroalcohol leaf extract of S. asper and its constituent apigenin- 7 glucoside have both anti-conciceptive and anti-inflammatory effects under certain experimental condition performed. The examination of the effects of ethyl acetate extract of aerial part of S. asper on nitric oxide production and prostaglandin- E2 level in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW2647 macrophages have showed that after treatment with ethylacetate extract of S. asper at 100 \u00b5g/mL resulted in almost complete inhibition of nitric oxide production. This study also revealed that on the application of 25\u00b5g/mL or greater amount of ethyl acetate extract suppressed the expression of pro inflammatory enzymes and cytokines viz, iNOS, COX \u2013 2, 1L - 1\u03b2, 1L \u2013 6, and TNF \u2013 \u03b1 drastically34. INDIAN J NAT PROD RESOUR, DECEMBER 2022 Anticancer potential The security effects of the methanol extract of S. asper against carbon tetra chloride (CCl4) induced oxidative stress in lungs have been examined. In this experiment the treatment of methanol extract of S. asper at 100 or 20 mg/kg body weight and 50 mg/kg body weight have given to male Sprague \u2013Dawley rats orally after 48 h of CCl4 treatment biweekly for 4 weeks. The result showed that the methanol extract of S. asper and rutin restored the lung content of GSH and CAT peroxidase, SOD, GSHPX, GST, GSR and quinine reductase to normal levels35. In an other study S. asper n- hexane extract was applied against KBrO3 induced nephrotoxicity in rats. In this study 32 male albino rats were randomly divided in to 4 groups and the experiment was go ahead for 6 weeks. Results demonstrated that introduction of KBrO3 in rats significantly reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes (P <0.01) while enhanced nuclear organizer regions (NORs) per cell and telomerase enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation, Which were notably improved by co treatment of S. asper n-hexane extract. This study showed that the n-hexane extract of S. asper contain bioactive constituents which has ability of repairing DNA fragmentation, reduces regyrophylic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag NORs), regaining telomerase enzyme activity and also other enzymes36. Anti-phytotoxic activity Antiphytotoxic effects of different solvent extracts of S. asper were evaluated against reddish growth under control environmental condition in growth chamber. Certain parameters were also studied in this experiment. The result revealed that in all the solvent extracts methanol extract exhibited marked antiphytotoxic activity22. Discussion Spiny sow thistle (S. asper) is an annual herbaceous plant of Asteraceae family and has been grown as pot herb since long time. The data provided here revealed that with 50 known species of Sonchus widely distributed in Europe, Asia and in Africa, S. asper (L.) Hill is officially recorded a medicinal plant. The aerial part of this plant are a rich source of protein, vitamins, essential amino acids and some minerals. They are used as a tonic to purify blood. It is applied on fresh in injuries on wounds, cough, bronchitis and asthma. They may prove beneficial to some extent to treat icterohepatitis, cancer, inflammation, rheumatism and in diarrhoea. Thus due to its various remedial properties the plant of S. asper has been getting attention of the medical practitioners as well as international health food industry now a days. According to this study it has been confirmed that S. asper possesses variety of pharmacological properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, phytochemical, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti-phytotoxic activities. It is highly rich in omega \u2013 3 fatty acids. The methanol extract of S. asper leaves shows good antibacterial activity against several bacteria viz, E. coli, B. cereus, S. aureus, and K. pneumonae, however zone of inhibition is more against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. The difference in sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria might be due to noteworthy difference in cell wall composition of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria37. Particularly in case of Gram-negative bacteria cell is rich in lipopolysaccharide which may be a region of difference of sensitivity in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The methanol and ethyl acetate extract of S. asper shows marked antifungal activity against A. niger while butanol and aqueous extract against F. solani. These results clearly demonstrate that the methanol extract of S. asper is active; however it shows more activity against bacterial pathogens than fungal pathogens. Several findings showed that the inhibitory effects of plant extracts against bacterial pathogens is due to their phenolic composition38,39 and antifungal property is due to saponins40,41. The antioxidant properties of S. asper plant are due to the presence of phenol or flavonoid components27. Due to the presence of various flavonoid contents plants may show antioxidant activities, however, phenol compounds are also good antioxidant agents, which act as terminators of free radical. From the study it was clear that the plant of S. asper has diverse antioxidant compounds viz., catechin, carotenoids and many other phenol compounds27. In addition to the anti-inflammatory potential the hydroalcohol leaf extract of S. asper as well as one of its major constituent apigenin \u2013 7 \u2013 glucoside (AP - 7- G) were significant33. From the anticancer potential point of view it is found that the methanol extract of S. asper and its rutin can protect the lungs against CCl4 induced oxidative damage in rats and n-hexane extract of S. asper was also found effective against KBrO3 induced nephrotoxicity in rats. A similar study also TRIPATHI et al.: REVIEW ON ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY PROPERTIES OF SONCHUS ASPER suggested that the induction of KBrO3 caused oxidative DNA damage in rats. Which also support these investigations42,43. It indicates that to some extent S. asper could be used as a potential resource of anticancer drug35. Although S. asper is an invasive plant species44. But the research carried out by scientists and nutritionists have proved it is potent nutritional and medicinal plant than any other leafy vegetables30. Different parts of the S. asper are used for different function as leaves and roots of the plant are used in indigestion and as a febrifuge. The roots of the plant act as a vermifuge and the stems are prescribed as a sedative and tonic45. Conclusion The present study reviewed the botanical description, ethnopharmacological uses, active phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of S. asper. This plant showed therapeutic potentials however unfortunately not all but some of the pharmacological studies were conducted in vitro, however in vivo studies also needed to explore their activities in depth in animals to validate it\u2019s in vitro activities. This plant reveals good therapeutic potential as anticancer agent against various cell lines. Further studies must be conducted to evaluate S. asper anticancer activity through in vivo studies and clinical trials. In addition, clinical test must be held to evaluate S. asper in clinical efficacy for humans. The data discussed might be useful in formulating new antimicrobial drug for treatment of infectious diseases also. The isolated compounds mentioned in the review may afford new drug entity with lesser cost and more efficacy.
