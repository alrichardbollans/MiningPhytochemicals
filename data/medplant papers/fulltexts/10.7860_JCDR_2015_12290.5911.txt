IntRoductIon
Due to the potent adverse effects of synthetic drugs and increasing 
contraindications to their usage, there is an increasing interest 
in the use of medicinal plants [1,2]. Recent studies on medicinal 
plants have also shown promising results in treatment or prevention 
of hard curable conditions such as diabetes [3,4], atherosclerosis 
[5,6], hypertension [5,7], and cancer [8,9]. Medicinal plants have 
also the capacities to diminish drug induced adverse effects [10,11] 
and heavy metal toxicities [12]. Most women believe that herbal 
medicines are safe and therefore pregnant women may use these 
herbs or their combinations during pregnancy [13].  
Although medicinal plants are considered to be safe however, some 
of them have been shown to be teratogen. Carthamus tinctorius 
causes complications such as eyelid defects or brain, renal, and 
hepatic toxicity [14]. Hydroalcoholic extract of Stachys lavandulifolia 
may cause significant decrease in height and weight as well as 
hepatotoxicity [15,16]. Therefore, investigation of herbal plants 
toxicity, especially during pregnancy and lactation, is necessary. 
Lawsonia inermis L. is a perennial shrub from the family of Lythraceae 
which is distributed in tropical zones of Africa and Asia [17]. It is 
used for a wide range of diseases such as skin fungal diseases and 
the relief of rheumatic pains. It has antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, 
analgesic, and antipyretic effects, antibacterial effect especially in 
gram positive bacteria, antifungal properties against trichophyton, 
sporotrichum, and Cryptococcus [18]. Moreover, it is used as a 
colouring agent especially for skin and hair [19].
The leaves of L. inermis include a pigment named lawsone or 
hydroxynaphthoquinone (3.1-22.0%), various glycoside phenols, 
coumarin, xanthone, quinoids, glycoside, β-Sitosterol, flavonoids like 
luteolin , 6% fat, 2-3% resin, 7-8% tannins, and 1.2% essence [20]. 
Other components of the leaves include 5-7% glycoside derivatives, 
gallic acid, 1&4 naphthoquinone, 1&2 laxatone, and some alkaloids 
[21]. The leaves of L. inermis cause hemolysis because it contains a 
substance with oxidant property named lawsone with the chemical 
name of 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. In high doses, it causes 
 
headache and poisoning. The available lawsone in L. inermis causes 
bradycardia [22]. Although some pharmacologic and toxic effects of 
L. inermis have been investigated, however, the teratogenic effects 
of this plant on the embryo at pregnancy have not been scientifically 
clarified. Therefore, in this study the teratogenic effects of L. inermis 
were studied in BALB/c mice.
MatERIals and MEthods
Materials
Female BALB/c mice between 8-12 wk were purchased from 
Tehran Pasteur Institute, Iran. Normal saline was purchased from 
Darupakhsh Pharmaceutical Company and other chemicals from 
Merck Company (Germany). L. inermis was collected in Yazd (Iran). 
Experiments
In this experimental study, 120 female BALB/c mice between 8-12 
week weighing 25-28 g were prepared and kept in proper health and 
light conditions (12/12 h light/darkness) without any food access 
limitation. After ten-day habituation to the environment, one male 
mouse and two female mice were placed in a cage for two days 
[23,24]. The vaginal plug was considered as the sign of zero day of 
pregnancy. Since this method was not certain, an eosin smear 3% 
was prepared from the vaginal discharges of the female mice and 
the existence of sperm was regarded as fertility [15]. Another sign of 
fertility was female mice's weight gain after fertility. Since the mice 
weight increases by 3-10% daily since the fourth day of pregnancy, 
the weight gain up to this level or more was regarded as the sign of 
fertility. Then, the mice were assigned to four groups. The animals in 
the first group (G1) were kept with no intervention, and the second 
(G2), third (G3) and fourth (G4) groups were intraperitoneally (ip) 
injected with respectively saline (0.3 ml), and 10 and 100 mg/kg of 
L. inermis extract (for 7 days) [25]. 
The two doses of L. inermis and saline were injected daily since 
the zero day of pregnancy till the seventh day. On the 19th day of

Background and aim: Lawsonia inermis is a medicinal plant 
with abortive properties. There has been no scientific study 
to evaluate the teratogenicity of this plant. This study was 
performed to determine the antioxidant activity and the possible 
side effect of L. inermis hydroalcoholic extract on development 
of congenital abnormalities in BALB/c mice. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 120 female 
mature BALB/c mice were assigned to four groups and after 
mating and confirming the vaginal plug, the animals in the first 
group (G1) were kept with no intervention, and the second (G2), 
third (G3) and fourth (G4) groups were intraperitoneally (ip) 
injected with respectively saline (0.3 ml), and 10 and 100 mg/
kg of L. inermis extract (for 7 days). On the 19th day, caesarean 
section was performed on the mice and embryos were examined 
for abnormalities. Their height and weight were measured. 
Data were analysed by ANOVA and post-hoc least significant 
difference tests.  
Results: There were significant differences between G3 and G4, 
and G1 (p<0.001); no significant difference was seen between 
G3 and G4. At 100 mg/kg dose of L. inermis, the parietal bones 
were absent in 90% of embryos and more extra ribs were 
observed in both G3 and G4 (p = 0.01). 
conclusion: L. inermis may have teratogenicity and should be 
used cautiously during pregnancy.

pregnancy, caesarean operation was done under anaesthesia with 
chloroform. The caesarean cut was in shape of inverse Y. After the 
caesarean section, fallopian tubes were opened and embryos were 
removed and placed in normal saline. Embryos were weighed by a 
digital sensitive scale and their heights were measured by a caliper 
from crown to rump. The embryos were assessed in terms of 
observable abnormalities. Then, after using Alizarin dye and Alcian 
Blue, the skeletal abnormalities were examined [15]. 
Extraction method
The aerial organs of L. inermis were collected from Yazd suburbs 
and after being authenticated by a botanist in the Research Center 
of Jahad-e-Keshavarzi, a herbarium sample was prepared and 
deposited in the Herbarium Unit of Medical Plants Research Center 
of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Iran (Code number: 
234). The collected plants were dried at normal temperature and the 
extraction was done by maceration method. To 500 gm of the plant 
powder in an appropriate container, 500 ml of ethanol 80% was 
added, and after 48 hour it was filtered. The solvent was removed at 
35°C using a rotary evaporator machine. The extract was incubated 
for two days at 40°C to dry. Then, it was kept in refrigerator until the 
usage time [22]. 
standardization of the extract
To standardize, the level of flavonoids and phenolic compounds 
as well as antioxidant capacity of the extract were measured as 
follows:
Measurement of flavonoid compounds level 
Aluminum chloride colorimetric and rutin method were run to assay 
the total flavonoids [26]. First, standard solutions (rutin in methanol 
60%) at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm were 
prepared. Then, one ml of these solutions was transferred into test 
tubes and mixed with one ml of chloride aluminum 2%. Then, 6 ml of 
potassium acetate 5% was introduced and the optical density was 
read after 40 minutes at 415 nm wavelength. The concentration 
levels of the standard solutions were assayed in three intervals. To 
measure the overall level of flavonoid in the extracts, 0.01-0.02 g 
of the extracts was dissolved with methanol 60%, reaching 10 ml. 
Then, the total level of flavonoid was measured by chloride aluminum 
colorimetry. However, instead of the standard solution, one ml of the 
extract was added. The total flavonoid level was calculated in mg/gr 
extract, equivalent to rutin. 
Measurement of total phenolic compounds   
Total phenolic compounds were assayed equivalent to gallic acid 
by Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetry [27]. The standard solutions were 
prepared at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 62.5, 100, and 125 
ppm of gallic acid in methanol 60%. Then, 0.1 ml of each sample 
was transferred into a test tube and 0.5 ml Folin-Ciocalteu 10% 
was introduced as reactive agent. The solutions were left for 8 
minutes at room temperature and 0.4 ml of sodium carbonate 
7.5% was added. The tubes were maintained for 30 minutes at 
the laboratory temperature and then assayed in three intervals by a 
spectrophotometer (Unico UV-2010, Japan) at 765 nm wavelength. 
To measure the overall phenol in the extracts, 0.01-0.02 g of the 
extracts was solved with 60% methanol, reaching 10 ml and the 
overall level of phenol was measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method. 
However, instead of the standard solution, 0.1 ml of extract solution 
was added. Finally, the overall phenol level was derived from the 
read optical density in mg/gr extract in gallic acid equivalent.
Measurement of antioxidant activity 
To measure the antioxidant activity of the extract β-carotene model 
was used [27]. In a suitable container 500 µL chloroform, 0.2 ml 
Tween 40, 5 ml β-carotene (0.2 mg) and 20 ml linoleic acid (20 mg) 
were mixed, and incubated at 500C for 10 minutes to remove the 
solvent. The solution was diluted using distilled water and mixed 
with 4 ml of aliquots in the following manner. The control solution, 
consisting of 0.2 ml ethanol and 0.2 ml of the extract sample with 
0.15 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml turmeric extract, was prepared. The 
optical density in the G1 was recorded at t=0 and t=90 at 470 nm 
wavelength, similar to the standard group. The specimens were 
incubated in a bain-marie at 500C. The antioxidant activity of the 
samples was measured based on the samples ability to prevent 
washing of β-carotene. The antioxidant activity was measured by 
the formula below [28]:
(1) AA = 100 {1 - (Ao- At) / (Aoo – Aot)}  
Where,
Ao: optical density at t = 0
At: optical density of the sample at t = 90
Aoo and Aot: optical density values in the control samples at t = 0 
and t = 90, respectively.
statIstIcal analysIs
Data were presented as frequency, relative frequency, mean, 
standard deviation and were analysed using ANOVA, post-hoc 
least significance difference (LSD) test and Fisher's exact test using 
SPSS 11.5 software.
REsults
Each 100 gr of L. inermis powder yielded 11.7 gr hydroalcoholic dried 
extract. The calculated levels for flavonoid and phenolic compounds 
were 94.19 mg/gr rutin equivalent and 126.38 mg/gr gallic acid 
equivalent, respectively. The extract antioxidant activity was 23.66%. 
The indices of embryos' height and weight were measured [Table/
Fig-1]. There were embryos in all selected mice; however, post-hoc 
LSD test showed that both doses of the extract caused a significant 
decrease in embryos' height and weight in comparison with the G1 
(p<0.001); however, no significant difference was observed in G3 
and G4 regarding these parameters (p>0.05).

Skeletal abnormalities including rib and parietal bone abnormalities, 
anencephaly and exencephaly of embryos in G3 and G4 are 
summarized in [Table/Fig-2]. The rate of extra rib, anencephaly, 
exencephaly, and parietal bone abnormality of the mice embryos 
was zero in G1 and G2. These rates were 10, 0, 0, and 23.3 for 
respectively extra rib, anencephaly, No significant difference in 
anencephaly and exencephaly was observed between the G3 and 
G4, and G1 (p = 1). exencephaly, and parietal bone abnormality of 
the mice embryos in the G3. Moreover, these rates were 20, 3.2, 
3.3 and 90%, for respectively extra rib, anencephaly, exencephaly, 
and parietal bone abnormality of the mice embryos in the G4. Since, 
it was not possible to compare the frequency of abnormalities in the 
four groups based on chi-square test, through merging the results 
of G3 and G4, and G1 and G2, those of G1 and G2 were compared 
and the difference was obtained significant (p<0.01). 
Based on Fisher's exact test, the abnormalities of the extra rib 
and parietal bone were significantly higher in G3 and G4 than G1 
(p<0.01). In addition, no case of extra rib or parietal bone abnormality 
was observed in G1 and G2 [Table/Fig-2]. At 100 mg/kg of L. 
inermis, there were no parietal bones in 90% of the embryos. Higher 
frequency of extra rib was observed in G3 and G4 (p<0.01). The 
rate of abnormalities was higher in the higher dose of the extract in 
comparison with the lower dose. 
dIscussIon
This study tried to examine the teratogenicity of L. inermis plant in 
BALB/c mice. Although L. inermis has been used as a medical herb 
in traditional medicine for therapeutic purposes, there has been no 
scientific study on its teratogenicity during pregnancy. 
In the present study, the extract of L. inermis caused skeletal 
abnormalities and height and weight loss in embryos. The comparison 
between the G3 and G4, and G1 and G2 showed that there was a 
significant difference in external and skeletal abnormalities and the 
extract of L. inermis caused anencephaly, exencephaly, extra rib 
abnormalities, and lack of parietal bone in mice embryos (p<0.05). 
In this study, abnormalities of extra rib and lack of parietal bone 
were observed in G3 and G4; however, their incidence was higher 
with dose of 100 mg/kg. Moreover, anencephaly and exencephaly 
abnormalities were only observed in the G3. Therefore, it can be 
said that the incidence of these abnormalities depends on the dose. 
What substance with which mechanism (s) causes abnormalities 
in mice is not clear and requires examining of the fundamental 
components of the extract. 
Previous studies have shown that Hypericum perforatum has 
teratogenic effects and these effects are due to the existence of 
two combinations of apigenin and alpha pinene [1]. The flowers that 
have high amounts of apigenin have been used to treat insomnia, 
convulsion, and asthma and to relieve nervous pains. Apigenin is an 
estrogen flavonoid available in aromatic plants. Apigenin has a slow 
metabolism and the adsorption and desorption phases happen 
slowly and therefore accumulation of this flavonoid in the body is 
probable [29]. Because it has been already shown that L. inermis, 
especially its hydroalcoholic extract, has high amounts of apigenin 
[30], the presence of this component in L. inermis hydroalcoholic 
extract could be one of the reasons for external and skeletal 
abnormalities.
Among the abnormalities developed in aborted embryos in this 
study are skeletal abnormalities (extra rib, lack of parietal bone, 
anencephaly, and exencephaly). Previous studies have shown a 
negative correlation between the lack of absorption of folic acid and 
skeletal abnormalities. The teratogenicity of lamotrigine in animals 
has also been attributed to reduced absorption of folate [1]. On the 
other hand, cineol is one of the probable combinations available 
in L. inermis hydroalcoholic extract and studies have shown that 
this component causes skeletal abnormalities (extra rib and lack 
of parietal bone) by affecting the liver storage of folic acid [31]. 
Regarding the mentioned components and their teratogenic effects 
on the skeletal system, the teratogenic effects of L. inermis could be 
related to cineol and loss of folate storage in pregnant mice. 
The results of the study showed that L. inermis extract caused 
a significant reduction in mice embryos’ height and weight. This 
result should, at least in part, be related to the available component 
of 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone in L. inermis extract. This 
component has oxidant properties and causes hemolysis. It is 
metabolized in liver and turns into toxic metabolites that cause 
a significant reduction in height and weight in critical stages of 
organogenesis in mice embryos [32].
conclusIon
In view of the obtained results about external and skeletal 
abnormalities including extra rib and lack of parietal bone, it seems 
that L. inermis should be taken cautiously during pregnancy. This 
study showed that L. inermis plant was able to create abnormalities 
in mice, and its teratogenic effects were dose-dependent. On the 
other hand, this plant was shown to reduce embryos' height and 
weight. Of course, the teratogenic effects of this plant should be 
studied more precisely.
