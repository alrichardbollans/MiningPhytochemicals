Palm oil analysis in adulterated sesame oil using chromatography and FTIR 
spectroscopy 
ABSTRACT 
This study highlights the application of two analytical techniques, namely GC-FID and FTIR 
spectroscopy, for analysis of refined-bleached-deodorized palm oil (RBD-PO) in adulterated 
sesame oil (SeO). Using GC-FID, the profiles of fatty acids were used for the evaluation of 
SeO adulteration. The increased concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids together with the 
decreased levels of stearic, linoleic, and linolenic acids with the increasing contents of RBD-
PO in SeO can be used for monitoring the presence of RBD-PO in SeO. Meanwhile, FTIR 
spectroscopy combined with multivariate calibration of partial least square (PLS) has been 
successfully developed for the detection and quantification of RBD-PO in SeO using the 
combined frequencies of 3040-2995, 1660-1654, and 1150-1050cm-1. The values of 
coefficient of determination (R2) for the relationship between actual versus FTIR-calculated 
values of RBD-PO in SeO and root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) obtained are 
0.997 and 1.32% v/v, respectively. In addition, using three factors, the root mean square error 
of prediction (RMSEP) value obtained using the developed PLS calibration model is 
relatively low, i.e., 1.83% v/v. Practical Application: The adulteration practice is commonly 
encountered in fats and oils industry. It involves the replacement of high value edible oils 
such as sesame oil with the lower ones like palm oil. Gas chromatography and FTIR 
spectroscopy can be used as reliable and accurate analytical techniques for detection and 
quantification of palm oil in sesame oil.
