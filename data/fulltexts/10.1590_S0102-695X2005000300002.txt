INTRODUCTION
 Pouteria torta (Mart.) Radlk (Sapotaceae), 
popularly called “guapeva”, “curiola”, “acá ferro”, 
“abiu do cerrado”, and “grão de galo”, is a perennial 
tree widespread in the Brazilian Cerrado, but can also 
be found from the Amazon region to the State of Bahia. 
People living in Cerrado eat the yellow fruits and use the 
tree bark as an antidysenteric medicine.
 In previous studies about the chemical 
composition of the hexane and dichloromethane extracts 
from the fl owers and fruits of P. torta, fat acid mixtures, 
poliisoprenoid compounds, hydrocarbon mixtures, and 
triterpenes were obtained (David, 1993). 
 Recently, it was reported that the methanol extract 
of P. torta leaves showed antimicrobial activity against 
Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Staphylococcus aureus,
Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Alves et al., 2000). 
 As shown above, despite the therapeutic 
properties attributed to P. torta, the plant has not been well 
investigated for its biological activities, and few data can 
be found regarding to the chemical composition of this 
species. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate 
the potential antitumor properties of the hexane, ethanol, 
and aqueous extracts and fractions from the leaves of P. 
torta by using the Artemia salina toxicity model, as a pre-
screening procedure, and the structural characterization 
of one of the components from the hexane crude extract.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
General procedures
 Column chromatography was carried out using 
silica gel Merck 60 (0.063- 0.200 mm). Analytical thin 
layer chromatography was performed on precoated 
ALUGRAM Sil G Machery-Nagel silica gel (60/0.2 mm) 
plates using UV light, anisaldehyde/H2SO4, and vanillin/
H2SO4 reagents (Wagner; Bladt, 1996) to visualize the 
spots. 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus 
spectrometer, Varian (7.05 T), operating at 75 MHz and 
performed in CDCl3/TMS.
13C chemical shifts (?) are 
reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS.
Plant material
 Leaves of P. torta were collected on the campus 
of the Universidade de Brasília in July, 2003. An exsiccate 
is deposited in the Herbarium of the Universidade de 
Brasília (UB) and the species was identifi ed by Professor 
J. E. de Paula (voucher number JElias de Paula 3674). 
Extraction
 The plant material was dried at room temperature 
and powdered in a knife mill. Part of this material (918 
g) was macerated at room temperature for seven days 
(repeated for three times), fi rst with hexane, followed by 
ethanol. After fi ltration, the solvents were removed under 
reduced pressure, at temperatures below 40 oC.
 The aqueous extract, from 400 g of the powdered 
material, was obtained by infusion, using distillated 
water (3 L). After fi ltration, the water was removed by 
lyophilization technique to yield 44 g (11 %) of crude 
aqueous extract.

ABSTRACT: Hexane, ethanol and aqueous extracts and fractions from leaves of Pouteria torta 
(Mart.) Radlk (Sapotaceae), a perennial tree, widespread in the Brazilian Cerrado, were tested for 
cytotoxicity with the Artemia salina toxicity model. Only the aqueous crude extract and the MeCN:
CHCl3 fraction of the ethanol extract presented toxicity (0.28 mg/mL and 0.27mg/mL, respectively). 
Lupeol acetate was isolated from the hexane extract. It is the fi rst report of lupeol acetate from the 
genus Pouteria.
Keywords: Pouteria torta, Artemia salina, Sapotaceae, lupeol acetate.

 Finally, the ethanol extract was partitioned 
using Hexane: CHCl3: CH3CN: H2O (2:1: 3.4:1) (Duarte 
et al., 2000) yielding three fractions. The yields of crude 
extracts and fractions are presented in Figure 1. 
Brine shrimp lethality test (BST)
 All fractions were tested for brine shrimp 
lethality. The assay was performed basically according 
to the simplifi ed Meyer’s method (Meyer et al., 1982). 
Briefl y, brine shrimp, Artemia salina L. encysted eggs 
(Maramar) were incubated in artifi cial seawater at 28 oC.
Samples were dissolved in 200 ?L of DMSO plus 20 mL 
of artifi cial seawater. Serial dilutions (triplicate) were 
prepared in the same solution. Metanauplii (10 units) was 
added to each set of tubes containing samples and the 
cultures further incubated for 24 h. Controls containing 
DMSO were included on each set of experiments. 
Potassium dichromate was used as reference standard. 
LD50 (after 24 h) were calculated by Probit analysis. 
Chemical constituents of hexane extract
 Hexane extract (5 g) was chromatographed 
over silica gel, by using hexane: ethyl acetate: methanol 
gradient. After analysis by TLC, the obtained 24 fractions 
were gathered in 8 groups. Group 1 (93 mg) furnished 
a hydrocarbon mixture. Group 3 (50 mg) was extracted 
by acetone, furnishing 25 mg of amorphous white solid 
characterized as long chain esters mixture. Groups 5, 6, 7 
and 8 (503 mg) were extracted by acetone: methanol (1:1) 
furnishing 82 mg (1.2 %) of a white amorphous solid 
(Pt1). Groups 2 and 4 were found to be very complex 
mixtures and were not studied at this time.

partition, we could separate the ethanol extract in three 
fractions with different polarity. 
 The chromatographic separation of the hexane 
extract of P. torta on silica gel column afforded Pt1. The 
13C NMR spectrum of Pt1 showed signals which led to its 
identifi cation as lupeol acetate by comparison of NMR 
chemical shifts found at the literature data (Sholichin et 
al., 1980; Freire et al., 2002). Herein, we point out the fact 
that this is the fi rst report of lupeol acetate in Pouteria
species.
 BST results are presented at Table 1. In the 
toxicity evaluation of plant extracts by brine shrimp 
bioassay, a LD50 value lower than 1mg/mL is considered 
bioactive (Meyer et al. 1982). In our experiments, we 
have used Meyer classifi cation to the crude extracts and 
fractions, but we assume pure compounds toxic, when 
the LD50 value is lower to 0.2 mg/mL. Based on this 
classifi cation, aqueous crude extract and acetonitrile:
chloroform fraction were considered toxic to Artemia
salina larvae (0.28 mg/mL and 0.27 mg/mL, respectively), 
and lupeol acetate was considered non-toxic. Taking into 
account the good correlation between the toxicity on 
Artemia salina with that on tumor cell lines (e.g, KB, P-
388, L5178Y and L1210) (De Rosa et al., 1994), as well 
with several others assays such as trypanocidal (Zani et 
al., 1995) and phototoxicity (Ojala et al., 1999), besides to 
seeking compounds for protective activity against active 
oxygen species (AOS)-related damage (Mathews, 1995), 
further studies on Pouteria torta  will be carried out to 
better defi ne the spectrum of its biological activity and to 
understand the chemical composition of its extracts.
