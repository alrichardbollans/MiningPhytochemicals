Box 4195, Murcia 30080, SpainReceived 1 March 1999; received in revised form 10 September 1999; accepted 10 September 1999AbstractCalli and suspended cells of Hypericum androsaemum accumulated high levels of 1,3,5,6 and 1,3,6,7 oxygenated xanthones. Themajor compounds include simple oxygenated xanthones or derivatives with prenyl, pyran or methoxyl groups, four of them beingnew natural compounds. A hypothetical biosynthetic scheme is proposed based on the isolated compounds and statistical analysis.Xanthone accumulation was influenced greatly by medium factors, namely hormone supplementation. Calli grown with 4.5 mMa-naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA)2.3 mM kinetin (KIN) had the highest specific xanthone production (1.3% biomass dry weight(DW)), whereas suspended cells grown in similar medium accumulated a lower amount (0.87% DW). Calli displayed a negativelinear relationship between total xanthone accumulation and NAA concentration, in the range of 4.5–22.5 mM. However, in thisrange the xanthone 1,3,6,7:1,3,5,6 ratio and the biomass production showed a positive linear relationship with NAA concentra-tion. Substitution of 4.5 mM of NAA by the same molar amount of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), in the presence of 2.3mM of KIN, caused a decrease in xanthone accumulation in calli. The use of N6-benzyladenine (BA) instead of KIN reducedxanthone production, independently of the auxin used. This effect was attenuated when both hormones were present. © 2000Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

IntroductionHypericum androsaemum L. has been usedwidely in Portugal as a medicinal plant. Its phar-macological properties have been attributed tophenolic compounds. Due to uncontrolled har-vesting as well as seasonal, climatic, and geo-graphic restrictions the availability of wild plantsfrom this species in nature is strongly limited. Invitro cultures may be an alternative choice whenthe active compounds are produced in such sys-tems. They provide a way to study the biosynthe-sis of secondary metabolites and the factors thatinfluence it giving some possibilities of controlledproduction. Detailed studies on the optimizationof the culture medium, identification of the fullrange of plant secondary metabolites produced,stability of production and definition of biosyn-thetic pathways by in vitro cultures have beenreported ([1–4], and refs. therein).In a previous work we reported that the majorphenolics produced by in vitro cultures of H.androsaemum are xanthones [5]. This type of com-pound is widely found in the Hypericaceae familyand has interesting pharmacological properties.Xanthones exhibit strong and selective inhibitionof monoamine oxidase A, in vitro cytotoxicity andin vivo antitumor activity, as well as antibacterialand antifungic activities ([6,7], and refs. therein).Abbre6iations: DW, biomass dry weight; NAA, a-naphtaleneaceticacid; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; IAA, indol-3-acetic acid;BA, N6-benzyladenine; KIN, kinetin; Xanthone 1,3,6,7:1,3,5,6 ratio,ratio of xanthones with the oxygenation pattern 1,3,6,7 and xan-thones with the oxygenation pattern 1,3,5,6.* Corresponding author.

Dias et al. : Plant Science 150 (2000) 93–10194In spite of the interesting properties of the xan-thones and the potentialities of in vitro culturesfor production of secondary metabolites, informa-tion about how xanthones accumulate in in vitrosystems is scanty [8–10].Manipulating culture conditions, particularlychanges in phytohormones is a valuable tool forincreasing the level of bioactive metabolites [11–13]. This paper reports the isolation and identifica-tion of the major xanthones produced by calli andsuspended cells of H. androsaemum. An evaluationof the changes in xanthones as a function ofchanges in growth conditions, namely phytohor-mones, is reported also.2. Material and methods2.1. In 6itro culture and phytohormonesupplementationSolid MS medium [14], containing 0.8% agar(Iberagar, J.M. Vaz Pereira, Lisboa, Portugal) and20 g:l sucrose, for calli, or liquid MS medium(without agar), for cell suspensions, was used asbasal medium.Calli cultures of H. androsaemum L. were estab-lished from stem segments of in vitro shoots main-tained on solid medium, supplemented with 4.5mM indol-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 2.3 mM kinetin(KIN), induced from stem segments of wild plants,collected in May 1996 in the National Park ofPeneda-Gereˆs in the North of Portugal. Calli cul-tures were initiated and maintained on solidmedium supplemented with 4.5 mM of auxin and2.3 mM of cytokinin. Several combinations ofauxin:cytokinin were selected to study xanthoneproduction: a-naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA):KIN,NAA:N6-benzyladenine (BA), 2,4-dichlorophe-noxyacetic acid (2,4-D):KIN, 2,4-D:BA and 2,4-D:BAKIN (in this case, with BA and KINsupplemented at equal amounts to give the finalconcentration of 2.3 mM of cytokinin). Addition-ally, combinations of 2.3 mM KIN with NAAcontents of 4.5, 11.25 and 22.5 mM were assayedfor xanthone production. Calli were maintained at2591°C under a 16-h light photoperiod, with aphoton flux of 30 mmol:m2 per s provided byOsram Fluora fluorescent bulbs. Cultures weresubcultured, at the end of exponential growthphase, at 5-week intervals. After the 3rd subcul-ture, calli were stabilized showing, however, areasof different pigmentation as well as developmentof root primordia. At the end of exponentialphase, after the 6th subculture, they were collectedfor xanthone isolation and analysis.Cell suspension cultures were established, in liq-uid MS medium supplemented with 4.5 mM NAAand 2.3 mM KIN, from calli grown on solid MSmedium with the same hormone supplementation.Cultures shaken at 120 rpm, under the same envi-ronmental conditions referred for calli, were sub-cultured every 3 weeks, at the end of exponentialgrowth phase, by transferring 25 ml of cell suspen-sion containing 2–2.5 g, biomass fresh weight, to a500 ml flask containing 150 ml of fresh medium.After the 4th subculture cell suspensions werestabilized. After the 8th subculture, at the end ofexponential growth phase, suspended cells werecollected for xanthone isolation and analysis.2.2. HPLC xanthone analysisGround freeze dried biomass (0.1–0.5 g) wasextracted with 10 ml of an aqueous methanolicsolution (80%), with sonication, for 20 min, atambient temperature and the homogenate wasfiltered. The process was repeated twice, first with5 ml of methanol and then with 5 ml of acetone.After that, the solutions were combined and evap-orated to dryness. The residue was redissolved in 5ml methanol and submitted to HPLC-DAD analy-sis as described before [5]. Quantification of thexanthones was performed by the external standardmethod, at 260 nm, as mangiferin (Extrasynthese,Geney, France) equivalents.2.3. Isolation and identification of xanthonesA mixture of ground freeze-dried calli and sus-pended cells of H. androsaemum (70 g), col-lected as described above, was first defatted withn-hexane in a Sohxlet apparatus, for 12 h, andthen extracted with hot methanol (4200 ml)followed of hot acetone (2200ml). The extractswere combined and evaporated under reducedpressure at 40°C. The residue was redissolved in20 ml of MeOH and then fractionated over aLobar C18 column using an aqueous methanolicsolution (10–95%) as eluent. The fractions con-taining xanthones were identified by HPLC-DADand submitted to semipreparative HPLC in orderA.C.P. Dias et al. : Plant Science 150 (2000) 93–101 95to isolate them. Elution was carried out as de-scribed before [15]. Identification of the isolatedxanthones was carried out by mass spectrometry(EI-MS probe 70 eV), and by 1H-NMR (300MHz, acetone-d6, ppm:TMS) and 13C-NMR (70.5MHz, acetone-d6, ppm:TMS) spectrometry, aswell as by UV spectroscopy study with the classi-cal reagents [7,16].2.4. Statistical analysisAll data were analysed statistically with theStatistica:Mac software (Statsoft, 1986–1991).Mean differences were analysed statistically run-ning the one way analysis of variance test(ANOVA). The homogeneity of variances wastested by a Cochran’s test. Post hoc comparisonswere performed with the HSD Tuckey test. Therelationship between xanthones was analysed case-wise with a Pearson correlation coefficient. Fur-thermore, we constructed matrices containing thesignificant (PB0.05) positive and negative correla-tions between individual xanthones for each typeof culture analysed, suspended cells or calli. Onematrix was constructed for each hormone mediumvariant tested.The linear regression analysis was performedwith the data analysis GrapPad Prism 1.0 package(GraphPad, 1994).3. Results and discussion3.1. Identified xanthonesTwelve xanthones were isolated from themethanolic extract of the in vitro biomass of H.androsaemum, and 11 of them were identified fully.These compounds comprise the majority of thexanthones detected by HPLC-DAD (64–80% ofthe xanthone fraction). They include simple oxy-genated xanthones or derivatives with prenyl,pyran or methoxyl groups (Fig. 1). Compounds 1and 2 showed the UV spectral characteristics ofFig. 1.

Data from 1H-and:or 13C-NMR confirmed the oxygenation pat-tern and allowed the localization of the prenyl,pyran and methoxyl groups. Compounds 1, 3, 5and 6 were isolated previously from H. androsae-mum roots [18], while compounds 7 (g-mangostin),10 (garcinone B), and 11 (paxanthone) were iso-lated from H. patulum cell cultures [19,20]. Thedata obtained by us were in good agreement withthose reported in the literature. As far as we areaware, compounds 2, 4, 8 and 9, although bearingthe same skeletal features as all the other identifiedsubstances, are now reported for the first time andtheir 1H-NMR data are presented in Table 1. Eachof these compounds present MS and NMR signalsconsistent with the presence of a prenyl group.Compound 2 ([M] at m:z 328) exhibited a pair ofortho-coupled at d 6.95 and 7.61; these high valuescan only be due to protons located in thedeshielded area of the carbonyl group [6] and this,together with the data from UV, confirmed theproposed oxygenation pattern. The prenyl groupwas located at C2 and not at C4, by comparisonof the H4 d value with those obtained for com-pound 7 and 10. Compound 4 ([M] at m:z 328)showed signals for three uncoupled protons, whichconfirms the 1,3,6,7-oxygenation pattern and theprenyl group was located at C2 by the samereasoning as for compound 2. Compounds 8 and9, in spite of having different HPLC retentiontimes and UV spectra, had similar mass spectra([M] at m:z 342) and 1H-NMR, with two meta-coupled protons on A ring (always lower d shiftthan those for B ring [19,20]), a singlet for oneproton on B ring, a singlet for a methoxyl andsignals for a prenyl group. The high d value ofprotons in position C-11 (d 4.12) indicates that theprenyl group is located at C8, in the neighborhoodof the carbonyl group [18,20]. Besides, the wholeset of values obtained for the prenyl group is ingood agreement with those obtained for com-pound 5. The location of the methoxyl group wasestablished to be at C-6, in compound 8, by NOEdifference spectroscopy, which showed 14% en-hancement of the H-5 (d 6.86) on saturation of themethoxyl protons. Since compounds 8 and 9 areisomers and the UV study, with the classicalreagents [7,16], showed that both have free hy-droxyls at C-1 and C-3, the location of themethoxyl, in compound 9, must be at C-7. Com-pound 12 was not completely identified but the 1HNMR spectra pointed to a derivative of com-pound 6 having another group linked to this struc-ture, since the mass spectrum indicated a highermolecular weight ([M] at m:z 368). On theHPLC-DAD analysis we have detected other mi-nor xanthones which have the same 1,3,6,7 and1,3,5,6 oxygenation pattern as indicated by theirUV profile.Peters et al. [21] reported that cell suspensioncultures of H. androsaemum accumulate severalnon-identified xanthones, which, from preliminaryspectroscopic data, are prenylated and:or C-glyco-sylated derivatives of 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxanthone.According to the same authors, all the xanthonesdetected in H. androsaemum lack a 5-oxo group.However, we identified also xanthones with a1,3,5,6 oxygenation pattern, indicating clearly thatH. androsaemum cell cultures have the biosyntheticcapability of producing 5-oxygenated xanthones.A.C.P. Dias et al. : Plant Science 150 (2000) 93–101 97The reason for this discrepancy could be at-tributed to different culture conditions used. Al-though mangiferin is the major xanthoneproduced by the aerial part of wild H. androsae-mum plants (results not shown), we did not detectthis compound in in vitro biomass of this species.Other minor non-identified xanthones producedby the aerial part of wild H. androsaemum plantswere also not found in in vitro biomass.3.2. Hypothetical biosynthesis pathway ofxanthonesMangostin that was identified in our in vitrocultures (Fig. 1, compound 7) was identified alsoin Garcinia mangostana (Hypericaceae) [22]. Cin-namic acid, benzoic acid, m-hydroxybenzoic acidand malonic acid were found to be efficient pre-cursors of this compound [22]. Beerhues and co-workers [21,23] have studied also the biosynthesisof xanthones in H. androsaemum cell suspensions.Their findings indicate that 3-hydroxybenzoic andbenzoic acids are efficient precursors of an inter-mediate tetrahydroxybenzophenone that is subse-quently converted to the xanthone backbone.Based on this information and in the compoundsisolated by us we proposed the pathway shown inFig. 1 for xanthone biosynthesis in in vitro cul-tures of H. androsaemum. The proposed scheme issupported also by statistical analysis (see Section2). Significant correlations (PB0.05) between in-dividual xanthones connected by the arrows wereobserved in the matrices obtained (results notshown), independently of the type of culture andhormonal supplementation. The only exception isthe putative conversion of xanthone 4 into xan-thone 7 (0.13BPB0.22). This could indicate thatxanthone 7 is originated preferentially from theconversion of 5 instead of 4. All correlations arepositive except those that involve cyclization of theprenyl side chain (5, 7 and 8 into 6, 10 and 11,respectively) which have negative correlations(Fig. 1).3.3. Xanthone accumulation in suspended cells6ersus calliAlthough the biosynthetic pathway had re-mained unchanged, the specific accumulation ofxanthones was influenced greatly by the hormonalsupplementation and by the physical state of themedium (Fig. 2). The highest specific productionof xanthones (1.3% biomass dry weight (DW))was observed in H. androsaemum calli grown withthe supplementation of 4.5 mM NAA plus 2.3 mMKIN. Suspended cells grown with the same hor-monal supplementation (4.5 mM of NAA plus 2.3mM of KIN) accumulated a lower xanthoneamount (0.87% DW). Nevertheless, this value ishigher than those reported for xanthone produc-tion by suspended cells of Centaurium erythraeaand C. littorale, which were 0.7 and 0.3% DW,respectively [9]. A differential xanthone accumula-tion depending on the type of culture had alreadybeen observed in in vitro cultures of C. erythraeawhere the production of xanthones by cells sus-pension was higher than in calli [8].Differences were also observed in individual ac-cumulations of each compound (Table 2) and inthe xanthone 1,3,6,7:1,3,5,6 ratio (Fig. 2). Thehigher total xanthone accumulation in calli grownwith the supplementation of 4.5 mM NAA plus 2.3mM KIN, relative to that observed for suspendedcells, was due to the selective increase in accumu-lation of xanthones with the 1,3,6,7 pattern (Fig. 2and Table 2). One exception was the compound 11that accumulated in suspended cells in a yieldFig. 2. Specific xanthone accumulation in calli and suspendedcells of H. androsaemum (, 1,3,6,7 and , 1,3,5,6 oxygena-tion patterns). Cultures were maintained with MS mediumsupplemented with 4.5 mM of auxin plus 2.3 mM of cytokinin,as described in Section 2. Results are means of six indepen-dent replicates.

In all equations the regression model is very significant (PB0.001).1.7-fold higher than that observed for calli. Theseresults seem indicate that the cyclization process ofthe xanthone 11 was favored in cell suspensionsand hampered in equivalent calli. On the contrarycyclization of 5 to 6 would be favored in calli andhampered in cell suspensions (Table 2). Cell cul-tures of H. androsaemum clearly accumulatedlower amounts of xanthones 1 and 2 (1,3,5,6 oxy-genation pattern) than the correspondent calli(Table 2). Nevertheless, total 1,3,5,6 xanthone ac-cumulation was not significantly different in bothtypes of H. androsaemum cultures (Fig. 2). Thiswas due to an increase in the production of otherunidentified 1,3,5,6 xanthones by suspended cells.These results indicate that in spite of the factthat culture media and particularly phytohor-mones play an important role in regulation ofsecondary metabolism [11–13,24,25], a balance ofseveral other factors also determines secondarymetabolites accumulation. The cell suspensions ofH. androsaemum are characterized mainly by iso-lated cells and small aggregates of two to ten cells,occasionally reaching 1 mm in diameter, in adedifferenciated state. However, in calli grownwith the same hormonal supplementation a certaindegree of differentiation occurred (see Section 2).This differentiation could have favoured xanthoneproduction in calli of H. androsaemum whereas theopposite may have occurred in cell suspensions ofthis species. Lack of cellular differentiation is of-ten considered as one of the major limitations inusing dedifferentiated calli cells for secondarymetabolite production [26]. Although plant cellsare totipotent and hence should carry the genesfor secondary metabolites as in the whole plant,these genes may not be expressed in a dedifferenti-ated state [27].3.4. Effects of phytohormones on xanthoneaccumulation in H. androsaemum calliThe total and specific xanthone production, thexanthone 1,3,6,7:1,3,5,6 ratio as well as biomasscalli production were influenced greatly by thephytohormones used, the type and ratios of auxinand citokinin concentrations (Figs. 2–4; Table 2).A.C.P. Dias et al. : Plant Science 150 (2000) 93–101100Some hormonal effects on the specific xanthoneaccumulation in calli seem be associated tobiomass growth. The production of calli biomasswas stimulated by the increase of NAA concentra-tion, in the range studied (Fig. 3). A tight negativelinear relationship occurred however, between to-tal xanthone accumulation by H. androsaemumcalli and NAA concentration. The replacement of4.5 mM NAA by the same molar concentration of2,4-D, in the presence of 2.3 mM KIN led to anincrease in biomass production (Fig. 4) and to adecrease in the overall xanthone accumulation(Fig. 2). The lowest total xanthone accumulationand the highest calli biomass production occurredwhen BA substituted KIN in medium supple-mented with 4.5 mM NAA (Figs. 2 and 4). Theinverse relationship between the accumulation ofsecondary metabolites and the biomass growthsuch as occurred in these three assays is a commonphenomenon referred already by other authors[13,26]. Apparently, 2,4-D, high levels of NAA, orBA in the presence of NAA, act in H. androsae-mum calli directing carbon and energy flow prefer-entially to growth (primary metabolism) instead toxanthone production.However, some other hormonal effects on spe-cific xanthone accumulation, not associated tobiomass growth, occured in H. androsaemum callisuggesting that the phytohormones tested havedifferent levels of action. Although xanthone pro-duction was negatively affected by the increase ofNAA concentration, in the range studied, suchinhibiting effect was lower in the relative accumu-lation of 1,3,6,7 xanthones (Fig. 3). With excep-tion for 6, 10 and 11, each identified xanthonefollowed the overall decreasing tendency with theincrease of NAA concentration (Table 2). Therelative percentage of the xanthones 6, 10, and 11,which result from the cyclization of the prenyl sidechain, increased with NAA concentration (Table2). These results show that the cyclization of theisoprenyl side-chain was favored by increasingNAA concentration. The replacement of 4.5 mMNAA by the same molar concentration of 2,4-D,in the presence of 2.3 mM of KIN, showed astrong negative effect in the cyclization of com-pound 5 leading to a deep lowering in accumula-tion of 6 (Table 2), highly responsible for theoverall decreasing in xanthone accumulation (Fig.2). Such as it was above described xanthone accu-mulation decreased but a selective increase in therelative accumulation of 1,3,6,7 xanthones oc-curred (Fig. 2), particularly those numbered as 7,9, 10, and 11 (Table 2). The use of BA instead ofKIN highly suppressed xanthone accumulation,independently of the auxin used (Fig. 2 and Table2). The inhibition induced by BA was particularlystrong in the accumulation of xanthones with the1,3,6,7 oxygenation pattern (Fig. 2). Conse-quently, this led to the lowest 1,3,6,7:1,3,5,6 xan-thone ratios observed in calli maintained eitherwith NAA:BA or with 2,4-D:BA. A negative ef-fect resulting from the use of BA instead of KINwas also observed in the phenolic production bycell suspensions of Cassia didymobotrya [28]. Theuse of KIN in conjunction with BA slightly sup-pressed the inhibitory effect of BA in xanthoneaccumulation (Fig. 2). This was due exclusively toan increase in the production of 1,3,6,7 xanthones.Changes on the expression and activity of severalenzymes due to the action of auxins and cy-tokinins, including enzymes from the phenyl-propanoid pathway, have been reported by otherauthors ([24,25], and refs. therein). It is probablethat phytohormones act facilitating or hamperingthe expression and activity of specific xanthoneenzymes influencing xanthone accumulation.The present studies indicate that in vitro cul-tures of H. androsaemum have the potential toaccumulate xanthones and their production can bepartially manipulated by changing the phythor-mone supplementation. Some results indicate thatphytohormones may act at the level of expressionFig. 4.
