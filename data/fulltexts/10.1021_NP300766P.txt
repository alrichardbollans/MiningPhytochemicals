Thestructure of compound 1 was elucidated through 2D NMR and otherspectroscopic techniques. In addition, the structure of withametelin L (2) wasconfirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using MTS viability assays,withanolides 1−5 showed antiproliferative activities against human glioblastoma(U251 and U87), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (MDA-1986), andnormal fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC50 values in the range between0.56 and 5.6 μM.Withanolides are a group of modified, highly oxygenatedC28 ergostane-type steroids, present primarily in severalgenera of the Solanaceae, which include Acnistus, Datura,Dunalia, Jaborosa, Physalis, and Withania. In recent years thesecompounds have gained significant scientific interest due totheir structural and biological diversity, in conjunction withtheir antitumor capacities.1−3 Recently we reported, as part ofan ongoing study, the isolation and antiproliferative activities ofa series of withanolides from Physalis longifolia, Vassobiabrevifolia, and Withania somnifera with oxygenation at C-1, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 17, 19, 20, 22, 27, and 28.4−7The Datura genus is a rich source of oxygen-substituted C-21withanolides,2 yet there have been limited biological activitystudies. We therefore chose to investigate the native Kansasplant Datura wrightii Regel to continue our Solanaceae-derivedwithanolide work and to further probe withanolide structure−activity relationships.3,4We report herein the first phytochemical and bioactivitystudy of withanolides from D. wrightii including all detailspertaining to the isolation, structure elucidation, and cytotox-icity (using MTS viability assays) of the new withanolidewithawrightolide (1) and four known withanolides (2−5).Compounds 1−5 were isolated from a CH2Cl2−MeOH(1:1) extract of the aerial parts of the title plant (seeExperimental Section). The molecular formula of the minorcomponent 1 was determined to be C28H38O5 by HRESIMSand NMR experiments, equating to 10 double-bond equiv-alents. The IR absorptions of 1 indicated the presence of OH(3435 cm−1) and keto and ester (1740 and 1705 cm−1) groups.The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals of threemethyl groups at δ 0.72 (3H, s), 1.12 (3H, s), and 1.42 (3H, s);four protons attached to oxygenated carbons at δ 3.31 (1H, t, J= 2.9 Hz), 3.71 (1H, dd, J = 3.3, 13.3 Hz), 3.87 (1H, d, J = 13.3Hz), and 4.64 (1H, brs); and two olefinic methine groups at δ6.00 (1H, s) and 6.75 (1H, s). The 13C NMR (APT) andHSQC spectra for 1 (Table 1) displayed 28 carbon signalsdifferentiated as three CH3, 10 CH2 (including an olefinic at δ130.3 and an oxygenated at δ 60.7), eight CH (including twooxygenated at δ 75.7 and 73.1), and seven C (including a ketocarbonyl at δ 217.7, an ester carbonyl at δ 165.4, an olefinic at δ139.0, and an oxygenated at δ 69.5), corresponding to C28H37.The remaining hydrogen atom was therefore assigned as an OHgroup, indicating that seven rings must be present in thestructure.The NMR data of 1 were closely related to a major isolate ofour investigation, the six-ringed withanolide withametelin L (2)[(20R ,22R ,24R)-21,24-epoxy-12β-hydroxy-1-oxowitha-2,25,25(27)-trienolide].8 The structure of 2 was confirmed byX-ray crystallographic studies as shown in Figure 1.Compounds 1 and 2 were found to contain identical bicyclicside chain moieties; an exocyclic double bond [an olefinicmethylene C-27 at δC 130.3 and two singlet olefinic protons atδH 6.00 and 6.75 (each 1H, s, H2-27)] conjugated with thelactone carbonyl (C-26: δC 165.4); characteristic signals foroxygenated C-21 [a methylene with δC 60.7 and two protons atδH 3.87 (1H, d, J = 13.3 Hz), 3.71 (1H, dd, J = 13.3, 3.3 Hz)]and C-22 [a methine with δC 75.7 and δH 4.64 (1H, brs)]; andSpecial Issue: Special Issue in Honor of Lester A.

Compound 1 showed unusual NMRsignals for a keto group (δ 217.7) and a methylene group [δC17.2, δH 0.78 (1H, ddd, J = 1.7, 5.8, 5.9 Hz) and 0.065 (1H, dd,J = 3.8, 5.8 Hz)], implying the presence of a five-memberedketo ring (the chemical shift value of a keto group in a six-membered ring is less than 210 ppm) and a cyclopropane ring(when considering the markedly low chemical shift value at δH0.065 and small geminal coupling constant 5.8 Hz),respectively. The presence of 1-oxo-3,5-cyclo-6-hydroxy in theA/B rings of the steroid nucleus was deduced by HSQC and1H−1H COSY fragment of −C(2)H2−C(3)H−C(4)H2− andHMBC correlations between H3-19 (δ 1.12, 3H, s) and C-1 (δ217.7), C-5 (δ 36.0), C-9 (δ 47.4), and C-10 (δ 52.6) andbetween H-3 (δ 1.39, 1H, m) and C-1, C-5, and C-6 (δ 73.1).The presence of a three-membered ring formed by C-3, C-4,and C-5 was also supported by the chemical shift values of C-3(CH, δ 16.0), C-4 (CH2, δ 17.2), and C-5 (C, δ 36.0). Thus,the planar structure of 1 was represented as shown.As for the stereochemistry, β orientation of the H-3 protonwas assigned based on the ROESY correlation between H-3 andH3-19. Axial β orientation of the OH group at C-6 wasestablished by the small coupling constant between H-6 (δ3.31, t, J = 2.9 Hz) and H2-7 and the ROESY correlationbetween H-6 and H-4α (δ 0.78, 1H, ddd, J = 1.7, 5.8, 5.9 Hz).These NMR data and assignments were in good agreementwith those withanolides reported in the literature with a 1-oxo-3,5-cyclo-6-hydroxy functionality in the A/B rings of the steroidnucleus.9,10 Accordingly, the structure of 1 was elucidated as(20R,22R,24R)-21,24-epoxy-3α,5α-cyclo-1-oxowitha-25(27)-enolide on the basis of biogenetic grounds and subsequentlynamed withawrightolide. Detailed 1H and 13C NMR spectro-metric analyses utilizing 2D correlational techniques wereundertaken and are summarized in Table 1.The four other withanolides were identified through datacomparisons with those published in the literature, aswithametelin L (2),8 withametelin, also known as daturilin(3),11,12 withametelin O (4),8 and withametelin F (5).13Withawrightolide (1) contains a cyclopropane ring, a rarity inwithanolides. A literature investigation showed that only five ofthe 820 withanolides reported to date contain a cyclopropanering: physalin S isolated from Physalis alkekengi var. f rancheti;9cilistols p, pm, p1, and u from Solanum cilistum (Solanaceae).10This is the first report of such a structural type3 present inDatura species.All the five withanolides (1−5) isolated were tested forcytotoxicity against human glioblastoma (U251 and U87), headand neck squamous cell carcinoma (MDA-1986), and normalfetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells, the results of which aresummarized in Table 2. Withanolides 1−5 demonstratedcytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.56 to 3.6 μM inTable 1. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR Data for Withawrightolide 1 in CDCl3position δC, type δH (J in Hz) position δC, type δH (J in Hz)1 217.7, C 15 24.1, CH2 1.73, m; 1.26, m2 39.6, CH2 2.81, ddd (1.7, 5.4, 18.1); 2.14, d (18.1) 16 26.7, CH2 1.74, m; 1.42, m3 16.0, CH 1.39, m 17 47.7, CH 1.75, m4 17.2, CH2 0.065, dd (3.8, 5.8); 0.78, ddd (1.7, 5.8, 5.9) 18 13.0, CH3 0.72, s5 36.0, C 19 15.0, CH3 1.12, s6 73.1, CH 3.31, t (2.9) 20 39.8, CH 1.84, m7 37.4, CH2 1.96, m; 1.27, m 21 60.7, CH2 3.87, d (13.3); 3.71, dd (3.3, 13.3)8 29.3, CH 1.86, m 22 75.7, CH 4.64, brs9 47.4, CH 0.97, ddd (3.4, 10.7, 12.2) 23 33.5, CH2 2.0, dd (1.7, 9.0); 1.90, m10 52.6, C 24 69.5, C11 22.2, CH2 1.42, m; 1.34, m 25 139.0, C12 39.5, CH2 1.89, m; 1.31, m 26 165.4, C13 43.3, C 27 130.3, CH2 6.75, s; 6.00, s14 55.8, CH 1.15, m 28 25.9.

Prod. 2013, 76, 445−449446the cancer cells and 3.3−5.6 μM in the normal fibroblasts.Specifically, concentrations required to obtain cytotoxicity inthe normal MRC-5 cells were 3.8−7.4-fold higher than those inU87 cells. Our previously published work on a commonlyknown withanolide, withaferin A,4,13 is provided as a control forcomparison. The potencies of 1−5 are on average slightly lowerthan withaferin A, suggesting that oxygenation of C-21 did notcontribute toward the observed antiproliferative activities.Furthermore, the comparison of withanolides 2 (12β-hydroxy3) and 3 revealed that oxygenation of C-12 is also not acontributor for antiproliferative activities. These observationsare in good agreement with those reported in the literature.3On the other hand, withanolides 1−5 appear to have greaterselectivity than withaferin A for cancer cells (especially in theglioma and head and neck squamous cancer cells tested)compared to normal cells such as fibroblasts with averageselectivity of between 4- and 7-fold. Such a level of selectivitymay provide for a larger therapeutic window for treatment invivo.Due to the observed proliferation inhibition of thewithanolides 1−5, further U251cell-based Western blot analysiswas performed. Total cell expression of heat shock protein 70(HSP70) and HSP32, proteins associated with cellular stressand withaferin A activity,13 was monitored 24 h post-treatment(Figure 2). Post-treatment HSP70 upregulation was observedfor 5 μM concentrations of withanolides 2, 3, and 5.Withanolides 1−5 elevated HSP32 levels in a concentration-dependent manner.In this report, the heat shock effect and oxidative stress effectwere abrogated following administration of N-acetylcysteine tothe cells. This stress response effect was observed only withcompounds 2, 3, and 5. It is likely that the epoxide at C5−C6in compound 5 may lead to free radical or reactive-oxygenspecies formation, which could explain an oxidative stress onthe cells. Additionally the double bond at C5−C6 (compounds2 and 3) may also convey some of the biologic activity seenwith these molecules, as compounds 1 and 4 lack either anepoxy group or a double bond at C5−C6 and do not exhibitthis stress response following treatment. Further studies,however, are warranted to validate this observation and morecompletely evaluate the mechanism of antiproliferative actionof these withanolides.■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations weremeasured with a Rudolph RS Autopol IV automatic polarimeter. IRdata were obtained with a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IRspectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AV-400 orAV-500 instrument with a cryoprobe for 1H, APT, COSY/DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY/ROESY. Chemical shift valuesare given in δ (ppm) using the peak signals of the solvent CDCl3 (δH7.26 and δC 77.23) as references, and coupling constants are reportedin Hz. ESIMS data were measured with an Agilent 1200 Series LC-MS/MS ion trap 6300 mass spectrometer. HRESIMS data werecollected with a LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer(Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Column chromatography wasperformed on silica gel (particle size 12−25 μm) (SorbentTechnologies, Atlanta, GA, USA), MCI CHP20P (particle size 75−150 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), Sephadex LH-20 (GEHealthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), or C18 reversed-phase silica gel(particle size 40−65 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich). Normal-phase silica gel GTLC plates (w/UV 254) and reversed-phase C18 TLC plates (w/UV254) (Sorbent Technologies) were used for fraction and compounddetection. The spots were visualized using UV light at 254 nm andspraying with 10% EtOH−sulfuric acid reagent. SemipreparativeHPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 unit equipped with a DADdetector, utilizing a Lichrospher RP-18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm).Plant Material. The fresh aerial parts of D. wrightii were collectedin July 2010 from the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge (latitude:38.10165°; longitude: 98.45496°), Stafford County, Kansas, andauthenticated by Dr. Kelly Kindscher of the Kansas Biological Survey,University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, United States. A voucherspecimen, 4091, was deposited in the R.L. McGregor Herbarium of theUniversity of Kansas.Extraction and Isolation. The collected biomass was air-dried,ground to a coarse powder (2.1 kg), and extracted three times withCH2Cl2−MeOH (50:50, 6.0 L) at room temperature. After removingthe solvents under vacuum, the extract (220 g) was suspended in 400mL of H2O, followed by successive partitions with n-hexane, ethylacetate, and n-butanol (3 × 500 mL). The resulting n-BuOH fraction(52 g) collected was applied to a MCI CHP20P column (2.0 kg) andeluted subsequently with mixtures of H2O−MeOH (100:0, 80:20,60:40, 40:60, 85:15, 0:100), in order of increasing concentrations ofMeOH. The 85% MeOH fraction (12.0 g) was subjected to silica gelCC, eluted with CH2Cl2−CH3COCH3 with increasing amounts ofacetone, to afford compounds withametelin L (2) (340 mg),Table 2.

A total of 10 166 reflections werecollected in the range 2.94° < θ < 69.26°, with 2971 independentreflections [R(int) = 0.0155]; completeness to θ = 66° was 96.5%.Multiscan absorption correction applied; full-matrix least-squaresrefinement on F2; the number of data/restraints/parameters were2971/1/443; goodness-of-fit on F2 = 1.060; final R indices [I > 2σ(I)],R1 = 0.0249, wR2 = 0.0646; R indices (all data), R1 = 0.0249, wR2 =0.0646; largest difference peak and hole, 0.169 and −0.126 e/Å−3.Cell Culture and Cell Proliferation and Viability Assay. Twohuman glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and U87, were generouslyprovided by Dr. Jann Sarkaria (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA).The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lineMDA-1986 was a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Myers (University of Texas,M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA). The fetal lungfibroblast cell line MRC-5 was obtained from ATCC. Cellmaintenance, experimental procedures, and data presentation weresimilar to those previously described.4,14 The U87 and U251 cell lineswere grown in DMEM (#6429; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL/100 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The MDA-1986 and MRC-5 cell lines were grown in similar media but alsosupplemented with 1% L-glutamine (200 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), 1%MEM-vitamin (100×; Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), and 1% MEM-nonessential amino acids (Sigma Aldrich). The cells were grown in amonolayer and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmospherecontaining 5% CO2 until they reached 75−90% confluence. Theviability of cells after treatment with withanolides (1−5) wasdetermined using an MTS assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well platesat 2500 cells/well in 90 μL of media. Following an approximate 6 hincubation period, 10 μL of drug-containing media in variousconcentrations was added to each well, and the cells were incubatedfor an additional 72 h. The number of viable cells was quantified by thecolorometric CellTiter96 Aqueous MTS assay (Promega, Fitchburg,WI, USA) at 490 nm on a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek,Winooski, VT, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Allexperiments were carried out in triplicate on two separate occasions,and GraphPad (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used togenerate best-fit sigmoidal dose−response curves for IC50 determi-nation.Western Blotting Analysis. Cells were plated at an amountpreviously determined, based on the growth characteristics of the cells,to have a high enough yield without achieving complete confluencyupon harvest and were allowed to grow overnight. Cells were treatedwith appropriate concentrations of the withanolides. Upon completionof treatment, proteins were collected, quantified, separated by sodiumdodecyl sulfate−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), andelectrotransfered onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane aspreviously described.4 Actin levels were assessed to ensure equalloading and transfer of proteins. Western analysis was completed inthe human U251 cell line. Primary antibodies were utilized againstHSP70 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA; ADI-SPA-810;1:1000), HSP32/heme oxygenase 1 (Enzo Life Sciences; SPA-894;1:1000), and total actin (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA;MAB1501; 1:50 000). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP (sc-2313;1:5000) and goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (sc-2005; 1:5000) secondaryantibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,CA, USA).■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT*S Supporting Information1H and 13C NMR spectra of withanolide 1 are available free ofcharge via the Internet at http://pubs.acs.org.
