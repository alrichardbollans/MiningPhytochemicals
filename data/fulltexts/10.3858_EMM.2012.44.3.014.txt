Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase 
(eNOS) plays an important role in vascular functions, 
including vasorelaxation. We here investigated the 
pharmacological effect of the natural product syringar-
esinol on vascular relaxation and eNOS-mediated NO 
production  as  well  as  its  underlying  biochemical 
mechanism in endothelial cells. Treatment of aortic 
rings from wild type, but not eNOS
-/- mice, with sy-
ringaresinol induced endothelium-dependent relaxa-
tion, which was abolished by addition of the NOS in-
hibitor N
G-monomethyl-L-arginine. Treatment of hu-
man endothelial cells and mouse aortic rings with sy-
ringaresinol increased NO production, which was cor-
related with eNOS phosphorylation via the activation 
of Akt and AMP kinase (AMPK) as well as elevation of 
intracellular Ca
2+ levels. A phospholipase C (PLC) in-
hibitor blocked the increases in intracellular Ca
2+ lev-
els, AMPK-dependent eNOS phosphorylation, and NO 
production,  but  not  Akt  activation,  in  syringar-
esinol-treated  endothelial  cells.  Syringaresinol-in-
duced AMPK activation was inhibited by co-treatment 
with PLC inhibitor, Ca
2+ chelator, calmodulin antago-
nist, and CaMKKβ siRNA. This compound also in-
creased eNOS dimerization, which was inhibited by a 
PLC inhibitor and a Ca
2+-chelator. The chemicals that 
inhibit eNOS phosphorylation and dimerization atte-
nuated vasorelaxation and cGMP production. These 
results  suggest  that  syringaresinol  induces  vaso-
relaxation by enhancing NO production in endothelial 
cells via two distinct mechanisms, phosphatidylinosi-
tol  3-kinase/Akt-  and  PLC/Ca
2+/CaMKKβ-dependent 
eNOS  phosphorylation  and  Ca
2+-dependent  eNOS 
dimerization.

Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from L-arginine by 
the reaction of three isoforms of NO synthases, in-
cluding the constitutive neuronal (nNOS or NOS1) 
and endothelial (eNOS or NOS3) isoforms and the 
inducible isoform (iNOS or NOS2) (Albrecht et al., 
2003). The catalytic activity of the two constitutive 
enzymes is generally regulated by intracellular 
Ca
2+ levels. Both enzymes generate small quanti-
ties of NO sufficient for activating soluble guanylyl 192    Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(3), 191-201, 2012

cyclase (sGC) to generate cGMP, cGMP plays a 
role of cellular signaling mediators, such as a neu-
rotransmitter and vasodilator, in neuronal and en-
dothelial cells under most circumstances (Hobbs et 
al., 1999). A third isoform, iNOS, typically ex-
pressed after exposure of immune cells and hep-
atocytes to inflammatory stimuli (e.g. cytokines and 
microbial products), produces large quantities of 
NO eliciting cytotoxicity against tumor cells and 
pathogens (Hobbs et al., 1999). Therefore, the lev-
el of NO production and the functional role of NO 
can vary among cell types.
          NO generated by eNOS in endothelial cells 
plays an important role in vasorelaxation, inhibition 
of platelet aggregation, endothelial cell survival, 
and angiogenesis, resulting in protection of the 
vasculature against various pathological conditions 
(Dudzinski and Michel, 2007; Namkoong et al., 
2008). As such endothelial cells play an important 
role in regulating vascular functions via eNOS-de-
pendent NO production. In fact, endothelial dys-
function contributes to the pathogenesis and pro-
gression of vascular disorders due to reduced syn-
thesis of NO from eNOS and/or increased NO 
scavenging by superoxide anion (Beckman et al., 
1990; Cai and Harrison, 2000). In addition, mice 
deficient in eNOS have been shown to develop 
vascular diseases, including hypertension and vas-
cular inflammation (Mashimo and Goyal, 1999). 
Thus, chemical or biological molecules that regu-
late eNOS activity can be used as a potential ther-
apeutic drug for vascular diseases by increasing 
NO production and bioavailability. 
     The catalytic activity of eNOS is associated with 
its homodimerization and/or phosphorylation of 
serine 1177 by increasing intracellular Ca
2+ levels 
and activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt pathway (Fulton et al., 1999). Shear 
stress and some growth factors, including vascular 
endothelial growth factor, promote eNOS phos-
phorylation and NO production, resulting in an in-
crease in vasodilation (Scotland et al., 2002; 
Hambrecht et al., 2003). Estrogen can stimulate 
eNOS activity in pulmonary artery endothelial cells 
via the elevation of intracellular Ca
2+ level, suggest-
ing that estrogen may be involved in NO-mediated 
pulmonary vasodilation at birth (Lantin-Hermoso et 
al., 1997). Recent studies revealed additional modes 
of eNOS activity regulation involving its protein/pro-
tein interactions and subcellular localization (Fulton 
et al., 2001; Albrecht et al., 2003). 
     Lignan  compounds  are  considered  as  the 
representatives of the phytoestrogens, a group of 
compounds that have shown to act as modulator of 
mammalian hormonal system (Adlercreutz, 1995). 
The lignan compound syringaresinol has been 
shown to inhibit inflammation in lipopolysaccharide- 
treated macriohages (Jung et al., 2003), gastric 
ulcer (Fujikawa et al., 1996), and oxidative injury of 
endothelial cells (Liu et al., 2009). Our previous 
results showed that another lignan compound 
sesamine promoted eNOS phosphorylation and 
NO production, which plays an important role in 
endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis (Chung 
et al., 2010), indicating that lignan compounds can 
increase NO production via eNOS phosphorylation. 
These evidences suggest that syringaresinol can 
potentially cause vascular relaxation by elevating 
NO production in endothelial cells; however, this 
possibility has not been investigated. Therefore, we Vasodilatory activity of syringaresinol    193

examined the pharmacological effect of syringaresinol 
on vasorelaxation and eNOS-dependent NO 
production and its underlying mechanism upon 
post-translation activation of eNOS. 
     We  found  that  syringaresinol  elicited  vascular 
relaxation in aortic rings pre-contracted with phe-
nylephrine (PhE), which was abolished by NOS 
inhibitor. Syringaresinol also increased in vitro and 
ex vivo NO production by activating two different 
signal pathways, Akt/eNOS- and phospholipase C 
(PLC)/Ca
2+/CaMKKβ-dependent eNOS phosphor-
ylation and Ca
2+-dependent eNOS dimerization. 
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that syringar-
esinol promotes vascular relaxation by increasing 
endothelial NO production through phosphorylation 
and dimerization of eNOS.
Results
Syringaresinol induces vascular relaxation by 
endothelium-dependent NO production
To examine whether syringaresinol regulates vas-
cular relaxation, endothelium-intact and -denuded 
aortic rings pre-contracted with PhE were treated 
with the indicated concentrations of syringaresinol 
and the relaxation was determined. Treatment with 
syringaresinol caused relaxation in endothelium-in-
tact aortic rings in a concentration-dependent man-
ner, and endothelium denudation completely abol-
ished the syringaresinol-induced vasorelaxation 
(Figure 1A). Treatment with syringaresinol pro-
moted relaxation in endothelium-intact aortic rings 
in a time-dependent manner, and this relaxation 
was significantly inhibited by the NOS inhibitor 
N
G-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMA) (Figure 1B). 
However, we did not find any cytotoxicity in aortic 
rings treated with syringaresinol in the presence of 
L-NMA for 40 min, as determined by confirming 
their normal relaxant responses to the exogenous 
NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 0.1 μM) 
(data not shown). These data indicate that sy-
ringaresinol elicits vasorelaxation by regulating NO 
production in endothelium. Since NO produced by 
endothelium diffuses to smooth muscle cells and 
promotes vasorelaxation by producing cGMP via 
the activation of sGC (Hobbs et al., 1999), we de-
termined cGMP levels in aortic rings treated with 
syringaresinol. Syringaresinol increased cGMP lev-
els, which was completely blocked by L-NMA 
(Figure 1C). Since three isotypes of NOS have 
been identified, we next examined the regulatory 
effect of syringaresinol on vasorelaxation in aortic 
rings isolated from knockout mouse of each NOS 
isotype (Figure 1D). Syringaresinol exerted vaso-
relaxation in aortic rings from nNOS
-/- and iNOS
-/- 
mice, but not in those from eNOS
-/- mice, indicating 
that syringaresinol increases eNOS-mediated NO 
production. Similar effects were obtained in sy-
ringaresinol-induced cGMP production (Figure 1E). 
These findings indicate that syringaresinol induces 
vascular relaxation by activation of the eNOS/ 
NO/cGMP signal pathway. 
Syringaresinol stimulates NO production in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse 
carotid artery
When HUVECs were incubated with 30 μM 
syringaresinol, NO production was significantly 
increased in vitro, as determined by the intensity of 
fluorescent DAF-FM (Figure 2A). The level of NO 
produced by 30 μM of syringaresinol was relatively 
comparable to that of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF, 20 ng/ml), a well-known growth 
factor that stimulates NO production in endothelial 
cells (Figure 2A). The syringaresinol-induced NO 
production was effectively inhibited to basal levels 
by the addition of the NOS inhibitor L-NMA (Figure 
2A), indicating that NO production was due to 
eNOS activation. However, syringaresinol exhibited 
no cytotoxicity in the same experimental condition 
as determined by crystal violet staining (data not 
shown). We further determined whether syringaresinol 
increases NO production in an ex vivo vessel 
model using isolated mouse aortas. Syringaresinol- 
treated mouse aortic rings significantly increased 
NO production when compared with control, and 
this increase was also inhibited to basal levels by 
the addition of L-NMA (Figure 2B).194    Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(3), 191-201, 2012

scribed in Figure 2. (E) Mouse aortic rings treated with the same as described in (D), and the levels of ex vivo NO production were determined by the

Syringaresinol increases NO production by 
activating PI3K/Akt- and AMPK-dependent eNOS 
phosphorylation
Previous studies have demonstrated that specific 
protein kinases, Akt and AMPK, are involved in 
eNOS phosphorylation and NO production (Dimmeler 
et al., 2009; Fisslthaler and Fleming, 2009). We ex-
amined the effect of syringaresinol on activation of 
these kinases and phosphorylation of eNOS. 
Syringaresinol treatment resulted in significant in-
creases in phosphorylation-dependent activation of 
Akt and AMPK in dose-dependent manners, lead-
ing to eNOS phosphorylation in HUVECs (Figure 
3A). To investigate the functional involvement of 
Akt and AMPK-dependent pathways in syringar-
esinol-induced eNOS phosphorylation, we exam-
ined eNOS phosphorylation in HUVECs co-treated 
with syringaresinol and Wortmannin (upstream in-
hibitor of Akt) or Compound C (AMPK inhibitor). 
Syringaresinol-induced phosphorylation of eNOS 
was significantly inhibited by Wortmannin and par-
tially reduced by Compound C (Figure 3B). To fur-
ther examine a role of AMPK in eNOS phosphor-
ylation, eNOS phosphorylation was examined in 
HUVECs treated with the AMPK activator amino-
imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) in 
the presence or absence of Compound C (Figure 
3C). Treatment with AICAR or syringaresinol re-
sulted in increases in AMPK and eNOS phosphor-
ylation, which were decreased by Compound C. 
We next examined the inhibitory effects of 
Wortmannin and Compound C on syringar-
esinol-induced NO production in vitro and ex vivo 
by confocal microscopy. Syringaresinol-induced in-
creases in NO production were effectively inhibited 
by Wortmannin and partially reduced by Compound 
C, in both HUVECs and mouse aortic rings (Figures 
3D and 3E). These results suggest that syringar-
esinol increased NO production via phosphor-
ylation-dependent activation of eNOS by activating Vasodilatory activity of syringaresinol    195

2+ levels were cap-
tured using a confocal laser microscope. Relative levels of intracellular Ca

both Akt and AMPK. 
Syringaresinol elevates NO production via 
PLC/Ca
2+-dependent eNOS phosphorylation
Mobilization of intracellular Ca
2+ levels is a critical 
event in eNOS-mediated NO production, a calmodulin 
(CaM) dependent process, which can be associated 
with the CaMKKβ pathway (Ramirez-Sanchez et 
al., 2010) and subsequently conformational change 
of the enzyme (Dudzinski and Michel, 2007). We 
next determined whether syringaresinol regulates 
intracellular Ca
2+ levels in HUVECs. Treatment with 
syringaresinol increased intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization 
compared with control, and this increase was in-
hibited to basal levels by the addition of the Ca
2+ 
chelator BAPTA-AM (Figure 4A). To confirm the 
functional involvement of Ca
2+ mobilization in sy-
ringaresinol-mediated activation of Akt and AMPK, 
which are responsible for eNOS phosphorylation, 
we examined the regulatory effect of BAPTA-AM 
on Akt- and AMPK-dependent activation of eNOS 
in endothelial cells treated with syringaresinol. 
Treatment with BAPTA-AM inhibited syringaresinol- 
induced phosphorylation of AMPK and eNOS, with-
out affecting Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4B), in-
dicating that intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization is crit-
ically involved in syringaresinol-induced eNOS 
phosphorylation and NO production in HUVECs. 
Since VEGF has been shown to phosphorylate 
eNOS through Ca
2+/CaM-dependent kinase and 
PKC, which are activated by intracellular Ca
2+ re-
lease and diacyl glycerol production upon PLC ac-
tivation (Wu et al., 1999), we examined the involve-
ment of these signal mediators in syringaresinol- 
mediated eNOS activation. Treatment of HUVECs 196    Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(3), 191-201, 2012

(U, 5 μM), Compound C (CC, 10 μM), Wortmannin (Wt, 100 nM), and 
BAPTA-AM (BA, 5 μM) for 30 min, followed by treatment with syringar-

termined by the same method as described in Figure 1. (B) The level of

with the PLC inhibitor U73122 and the CaM antag-
onist W-7 abolished the effect of syringaresinol on 
AMPK and eNOS phosphorylation (Figure 4C), 
whereas the PKC inhibitors Genistein and 
GF109203X had no effect (Figure 4D). We next ex-
amined the possible involvement of CaMKKβ in sy-
ringaresinol-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation fol-
lowing knockdown of CaMKKβ by transfection with 
specific siRNA. Knockdown of CaMKKβ sup-
pressed AMPK phosphorylation and subsequently 
reduced eNOS activation in HUVECs treated with 
syringaresinol (Figure 4E). Syringaresinol- induced 
NO production was inhibited by treatment with 
U73122, W-7, and CaMKKβ siRNA (Figure 4F). 
These results demonstrate that syringaresinol pro-
motes eNOS phosphorylation and subsequent NO 
production by CaMKKβ-dependent AMPK activated 
by PLC-mediated intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization.
Syringaresinol promotes NO production via eNOS 
dimerization
The active form of NOS appears to be a homo-
dimer, which is regulated by intracellular levels of 
Ca
2+, required for CaM binding to the linker region 
between reductase and oxygenase domains of the 
enzyme (Hellermann and Solomonson, 1997). We 
investigated the effect of syringaresinol on eNOS 
dimerization in HUVECs, as determined by LT-PAGE 
and Western blot analysis. Treatment with sy-
ringaresinol resulted in a significant increase in the 
dimer form of eNOS and a concomitant decrease 
in the monomer form, and eNOS dimerization was 
abolished by treatment with U73122 and BAPTA-AM 
(Figures 5A and 5B). In addition, treatment with 
BAPTA-AM inhibited syringaresinol-induced NO 
production (Figure 5C). These results indicate that 
syringaresinol promotes NO production via eNOS 
dimerization promoted by the elevation of PLC-de-
pendent intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization.
Syringaresinol-induced vasorelaxation is 
associated with the activation of PLC/Ca
2+/AMPK and 
PI3/Akt pathways
To verify whether the PLC/Ca
2+ and PI3/Akt path-
ways play a critical role in syringaresinol-induced 
vascular relaxation, endothelium-intact arterial rings 
pretreated with inhibitors of PLC, AMPK, and PI3K 
as well as a Ca
2+ chelator, followed by treatment with 
syringaresinol. Pretreatment with U73122, Compound 
C, Wortmannin, and BAPTA-AM significantly atte-
nuated syringaresinol-induced vasorelaxation in 
aortic rings pre-contracted with PhE (Figure 6A). 
We further examined the effects of these inhibitors 
on syringaresinol-induced cGMP production in en-
dothelium-intact aortic rings. Pretreatment with Vasodilatory activity of syringaresinol    197
Figure 7. Schematic proposal for the mechanism responsible for sy-
ringaresinol-induced vasorelaxation. Syringaresinol activates both PLC 
and PI3K, which induce intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization and Akt, 
respectively. Increased intracellular Ca
2+ level promotes eNOS dimeriza-
tion and CaMKKβ/AMPK responsible for eNOS phosphorylation. In addi-
tion, the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes eNOS phosphorylation. These bio-
chemical events result in an increase in eNOS-dependent NO synthesis 
and subsequent activation of sGC in smooth muscle cells to synthesize 
cGMP from GTP, leading to vascular relaxation.
these inhibitors significantly decreased syringaresinol- 
induced increase in cGMP production (Figure 6B). 
These findings indicate that syringaresinol induces 
vascular relaxation by elevating eNOS-dependent 
NO production via the activation of PI3/Akt- and 
PLC/Ca
2+-dependent pathways.
Discussion
This study was undertaken to examine the phar-
macological and biological effects of syringaresinol 
on vascular relaxation and NO production, as well 
as to investigate its underlying mechanism upon 
post-translational activation of eNOS in primary 
HUVECs and in ex vivo mouse aortic rings. We 
here found that syringaresinol effectively elicited 
vascular relaxation in aortic rings pre-contracted 
with PhE and significantly promoted in vitro and ex 
vivo NO production by both phosphorylation- 
dependent and conformation-based eNOS activation 
via PI3K/Akt- and PLC/CaMKKβ/AMPK-dependent 
pathways and Ca
2+-mediated eNOS dimerization.
     Endothelial  cells  respond  to  various  physio-
logical stimuli by releasing endothelium-dependent 
vasodilators, including NO (Ignarro et al., 1987) 
and prostacyclin (Moncada et al., 1978). Of them, 
NO is produced by eNOS in the endothelium and 
diffuses out of endothelial cells into surrounding 
cells; some enters smooth muscle cells where it 
activates sGC to catalyze the conversion of GTP to 
cGMP, which induces vascular relaxation by acti-
vating protein kinase G. In this study, we showed 
that syringaresinol results in vasorelaxation in en-
dothelium-intact, but not in endothelium-denuded, 
mouse aortic rings, indicating that vasorelaxation is 
elicited by vasodilators produced by intact en-
dothelium. In addition, we found that the NOS in-
hibitor L-NMA completely abolished syringaresinol- 
induced vasorelaxation and cGMP production. 
These results indicate that endothelium-dependent 
component of the relaxant action of syringaresinol 
is due to enhanced endothelial NO synthesis or bi-
oavailability and subsequent activation of NO-cGMP 
pathway.
     NO  rapidly  reacts  with  superoxide  anion  and 
forms peroxynitrite, which is considered to be a 
toxic compound (Beckman et al., 1990). It is also 
possible that this reaction inhibits the cellular effects 
of NO, such as vasodilation and platelet aggregation, 
probably by decreasing NO bioavailability and 
cGMP production (Oury et al., 1996). Antioxidants 
that scavenge superoxide anion increase NO bio-
availability and promote vasorelaxation. Syring-
aresinol has been suggested to possess antioxidant 
activity (Lee et al., 1999). Our data demonstrate 
that syringaresinol-induced relaxation in aortic 
rings from wild type mice, which was inhibited by 
L-NMA. However, syringaresinol did not alter 0.1 
μM SNP-induced relaxation in both wild-type aortic 
rings in the presence of L-NMA and eNOS- 
deficient aortic rings (data not shown), indicating 
that this compound did not affect NO bioavailability. 
These results suggest that syringaresinol-induced 
vasorelaxation is associated with endothelial NO 
synthesis, but not with its antioxidant activity.
     Endothelial-derived NO production is linked not 
only to post-translational modulation of eNOS 
activity (Hellermann and Solomonson, 1997; Fulton 
et al., 2001; Albrecht et al., 2003), but also to 
increased transcriptional expression (MacRitchie et 
al., 1997). Although eNOS has been known to be 
constitutively expressed under quiescent conditions, 
this enzyme can be upregulated at the level of 
gene transcription by the female gonadal hormone 
estrogen (MacRitchie et al., 1997). We found that 
syringaresinol increased endothelial NO production 
without changing the levels of eNOS protein and 
mRNA in HUVECs as determined by Western blot 
(Figures 3 and 4) and real-time reverse transcriptase- 
polymerase chain reaction (data not shown), 
indicating that this compound increased endothelial 
NO synthesis by regulating eNOS activity without 
changing its expression and stability. Although 
eNOS activity was initially identified to be regulated 
by Ca
2+/CaM-dependent protein dimerization, recent 
studies have revealed additional modes of post-
translational eNOS regulation involving phosphor-
ylation, protein/protein interactions, and subcellular 198    Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(3), 191-201, 2012
localization (Fulton et al., 2001; Albrecht et al., 
2003). Evidences provided herein demonstrate that 
syringaresinol increases in vitro and ex vivo NO 
production by two distinctive mechanisms, phosphor-
ylation-dependent eNOS activation and Ca
2+-depen-
dent eNOS dimerization (Figure 7).
     The  eNOS  activity  can  be  stimulated  by 
phosphorylation at Ser1177 (human)/1179 (bovine) 
in the reductase domain (Dimmeler et al., 1999; 
Fulton et al., 1999; Michell et al., 2001). Phosphor-
ylation of Ser1177 is one of the critical steps for 
eNOS activation in response to several stimuli, 
such as shear stress, VEGF, statins, and thrombin, 
which are known to increase endothelial NO 
production (Dimmeler et al., 1999; Harris et al., 
2004; Stahmann et al., 2006). These stimuli 
activate a number of protein kinases, including Akt, 
AMPK, PKA, and CaMKKβ, which in turn 
phosphorylate Ser1177 (Fulton et al., 2001; Michell 
et al., 2001; Dudzinski and Michel, 2007). We here 
demonstrate that syringaresinol promoted activation 
of the eNOS-phosphorylating kinases Akt and 
AMPK. Syringaresinol-induced eNOS phosphorylation 
and NO production were suppressed by treatment 
with the PI3K inhibitor (Wortmannin) and AMPK 
inhibitor (Compound C). These inhibitors also showed 
suppressive effects on syringaresinol-induced cGMP 
production and vasorelaxation in aortic rings. On 
the other hand, the PKA inhibitor H89 did not affect 
syringaresinol-induced eNOS phosphorylation and 
vasorelaxation (data not shown). These results 
suggest that syringaresinol caused vascular relaxation 
by increasing phosphorylation-dependent activation 
of eNOS and subsequent NO production via 
activation of both PI3K/Akt- and AMPK-dependent 
signal pathways.
     Ca
2+ mobilization in the cytosol is a critical de-
terminant of eNOS activity through dimerization- 
based activation (Hellermann and Solomonson, 
1997) and phosphorylation-dependent enzyme 
modification (Stahmann et al., 2006). A recent study 
demonstrated that thrombin induced eNOS phos-
phorylation and activation by increasing intra-
cellular Ca
2+ mobilization through PLC activation 
(Stahmann et al., 2006). Thrombin-stimulated eNOS 
activation is directly associated with a previously 
known Ca
2+/CaM-dependent mechanism (eNOS di-
merization) and a PKCδ sensitive, but PI3K/Akt- in-
dependent, pathway responsible for bovine eNOS 
phosphorylation at Ser1177. Our data showed that 
syringaresinol-induced eNOS phosphorylation was 
not affected by PKC inhibitors Genistein and 
GF109203X, indicating that PKC is not involved in 
phosphorylation of eNOS by syringaresinol. 
However, we found that treatment with PLC in-
hibitor, Ca
2+ chelator, CaM antagonist, AMPK in-
hibitor, and CaMKKβ siRNA inhibited eNOS phos-
phorylation and NO production via the inhibition of 
AMPK. Our data also showed that AICAR induced 
AMPK activation and eNOS phosphorylation, which 
were suppressed by the AMPK inhibitor Compound 
C. These data indicate that syringaresinol promotes 
eNOS phosphorylation by activating AMPK via the 
activation of PLC/Ca
2+/ CaMKKβ axis, which repre-
sents a novel signaling mechanism for NO pro-
duction in HUVECs and subsequent induction of 
vasodilation (Figure 7).
     The eNOS enzyme is only fully functional in a 
homodimeric form (List et al., 1997). Dimerization 
of eNOS is dependent on the number of cofactor 
molecules bound, such as tetrahydrobiopterin and 
heme (Fulton et al., 2001; Albrecht et al., 2003). 
Dimerization of eNOS starts with the binding of 
heme; without heme, the eNOS enzyme only exists 
as a monomer. The initial formation of a dimer by 
binding heme to monomeric eNOS makes it 
possible for tetrahydrobiopterin to bind to the eNOS 
dimer, which leads to the stabilization of eNOS 
protein in the active homodimer form (List et al., 
1997; Venema et al., 1997). Elevation of cytosolic 
Ca
2+ levels also promotes dimerization of the 
oxygenase domain of human eNOS, as well as 
increases catalytic function of eNOS by facilitating 
electron transfer between the enzyme’s reductase 
and oxygenase domains (Hellermann and Solo-
monson, 1997; Dudzinski and Michel, 2007). We 
found that syringaresinol significantly increased 
eNOS dimerization, which was inhibited by the 
PLC inhibitor U73122 and the Ca
2+ chelator 
BAPTA-AM. Furthermore, these inhibitors attenuated 
syringaresinol-induced vasorelaxation and cGMP 
production. These results indicate that syringaresinol 
increases NO production via eNOS dimerization by 
promoting a PLC-dependent increase in cytosolic 
Ca
2+ levels, resulting in vascular relaxation. 
     Decreased  NO  production  in  endothelial  cells 
promotes the pathogenesis of various vascular 
diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, 
and delayed wound healing (Hobbs et al., 1999; 
Albrecht et al., 2003). Our results demonstrate that 
syringaresinol promoted vasorelaxation via the 
elevation of NO-dependent vascular cGMP production 
by two distinct mechanisms, such as phosphorylation- 
dependent eNOS activation via the PI3K/Akt- and 
PLC/CaMKKβ/AMPK-dependent pathways and 
conformation-based eNOS activation via Ca
2+- 
mediated eNOS dimerization (Figure 7). Thus, these 
findings suggest that syringaresinol can be considered 
as a potential drug for hypertension by activating 
the vascular eNOS/NO/cGMP pathway.Vasodilatory activity of syringaresinol    199
Methods
Materials
Heparin, penicillin, streptomycin, and M199 were pur-
chased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). 
VEGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake 
Placid, NY). All antibodies used in the study were pur-
chased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and 
BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). 
Wortmannin, Compound C, U73122, and BAPTA-AM were 
purchased from Calbiochem Inc. (San Diego. CA). W-7 
and CaMKKβ siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Syringaresinol was iso-
lated from dried stems of Acanthopanax divaricatus, and 
purity was more than 98% as determined by HPLC analysis. 
All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise. 
Vascular function analysis 
C57BL/6J mice (wild type, iNOS
-/-, eNOS
-/-, and nNOS
-/-) 
obtained from Jackson Laboratory were sacrificed by cer-
vical dislocation. The carotid arteries from mice were care-
fully dissected from surrounding fat and connective tissues. 
The dissected artery was cut into 2 mm long circular seg-
ments that were immediately placed in ice-cold 
Krebs-Ringer solution (118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.1 mM 
MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 
and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and aerated with 95% O2 and 
5% CO2. All dissecting procedures were done with extreme 
care to protect the endothelium from inadvertent damage. 
In some vessel rings, the endothelial layer was mechan-
ically removed by gently rubbing the luminal surface of the 
ring back and forth several times with a human hair. 
Endothelial integrity or functional removal was verified by 
the presence or absence of the relaxant response to ace-
tylcholine (1 μM) in contracted vessels. Isomeric vascular 
tone was measured as described previously (Chataigneau 
et al., 1999). Each carotid arterial ring was suspended by 
means of two wires inserted into the ring lumen in an organ 
bath containing Krebs-Ringer solution at 37°C, while being 
continuously supplied with mixed gas composed of 95% O2 
and 5% CO2. The baseline load placed on the arterial ring 
was 2 g and the changes in isometric tension were re-
corded using a force-displacement transducer with a com-
puterized recording system (DMT320M, AD Instruments, 
Denmark). In the first set of experiments, the arterial rings 
were contracted with PhE, 1 μM to obtain maximal 
response. The response to acetylcholine (1 μM) was test-
ed as a positive control in endothelium-intact aortic rings 
contracted by PhE. After each test, the arterial rings were 
washed three times with fresh Krebs-Ringer solution and 
allowed 30 min to equilibrate. Once the maximal response 
to PhE had been obtained, the indicated concentrations or 
30 μM of syringaresinol were added to the bath and the re-
laxation was recorded. To further explore the possible 
mechanism of relaxation response caused by syringar-
esinol, several chemical inhibitors were pre-incubated for 
20 min in endothelium intact aortic rings and response 
caused by syringaresinol was obtained after treatment with 
1 μM PhE. 
Measurement of cGMP levels in mouse aorta
Strips of mouse aortic rings were incubated at 37°C for 40 
min in 12-well culture plates containing Krebs solution 
gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and incubated for an ad-
ditional 5 min in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 
(100 μM). The aortic rings were incubated with syringar-
esinol in the presence or absence of the nitric oxide in-
hibitor L-NMA for 30 min and frozen quickly in liquefied N2. 
Tissue lysates were prepared by homogenization with a 
Polytron homogenizer and centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 
20 min. The level of cGMP was measured using an en-
zyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann 
Arbor, MI) in accordance to the instructions of the 
manufacturer.
Cell culture
HUVECs were isolated from human umbilical veins by col-
lagenase, as previously described (Lee et al., 2006) and 
used in passages 3-8. The cells were grown in M199 sup-
plemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml strepto-
mycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth 
factor, and 5 U/ml heparin at 37°C in humidified 5% 
CO2/95% air. 
Cell viability assay
HUVECs (2 ×10
5 cells/well) were plated onto 6-well plates 
in 2 ml of M199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum until 
cell density was reached to 70-80% confluence. Cells were 
treated with syringaresinol for 1 h, and cell viability was de-
termined by the crystal violet staining method, as de-
scribed previously (Lee et al., 2005). 
NO measurement
The level of cellular NO production was measured by using 
4-amino-5-methylamino-2,7-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) 
diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described 
previously (Lee et al., 2006). Briefly, after treatment with or 
without 20 ng VEGF, 30 μM syringaresinol, and 1 mM 
L-NMA for 1 h, HUVECs were washed twice with se-
rum-free M199 and then incubated with 5 μM DAF-FM di-
acetate for 30 min at 37°C. After removing the excess 
probe, relative levels of intracellular NO were determined 
from the fluorescence intensity of DAF-FM via confocal 
microscopy.  ex vivo NO production was measured in 
mouse aortic rings incubated with 5 μM DAF-FM diacetate 
and syringaresinol (30 μM) using a real-time fluorescence 
microscope with optimized excitation and emission wave-
length (470/525 nm). 
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The mem-
branes were incubated with antibodies against target pro-
teins for 2 h following pre-hybridization with bovine serum 
albumin. The signal intensities of immunoreactive bands 
were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence sys-200    Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 44(3), 191-201, 2012
tem, as described previously (Lee et al., 2007). 
Intracellular Ca
2+ mobilization
The levels of intracellular Ca
2+ were measured in situ by 
confocal microscopy using the Ca
2+ probe Fluo-4-AM 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). HUVECs were incubated 
in serum-free M199 containing 5 μM Fluo-4 for 30 min at 
37°C. After removing the excess dye, cells were incubated 
with syringaresinol in Hanks balanced salt solution 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Intracellular fluorescence was analyzed 
using confocal microscopy and results were expressed as 
the relative fluorescence intensity.
Transfection with siRNA
CaMKKβ-specific siRNA (sc-38955) and control siRNA 
(5'-GGCUACGTCCAGGAGCGCA-3') were obtained from 
Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and Samchully Pharm 
(Seoul, Korea), respectively. HUVECs were grown to 70% 
confluence and transfected with 40 nM siRNA CaMKKβ us-
ing Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The levels of CaMKKβ 
were analyzed by Western blot at 48 h after transfection. 
Determination of eNOS dimerization
Dimers and monomers of eNOS were separated using 
low-temperature SDS-PAGE (LT-PAGE) as previously de-
scribed (Yang et al., 2009; Woo et al., 2010). Briefly, 
HUVECs were treated with syringaresinol for 30 min fol-
lowing pretreatment with U73122 (5 μM) and BAPTA-AM 
(5 μM) for 30 min. Cell lysates were loaded on SDS-gel, 
which was equilibrated at 4°C before electrophoresis, and 
the buffer tank was placed in an ice bath during electro-
phoresis to maintain the temperature of the gel ＜10
oC. 
Subsequent to LT-PAGE, eNOS proteins were determined 
by Western blotting analysis.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation 
(S.D.) of at least three independent experiments. One-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare each 
parameter. Student's t-test was also performed to identify 
which group difference accounted for the significant overall 
analysis of variance. P ＜0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
