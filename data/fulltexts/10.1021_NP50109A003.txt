ABSTRhCT.-Pour new alkaloids were obtained from Grlatteria fifiosa, namely, the 
noraporphines (-)-3-metlioxyputerine [I] and (+)-norguattevaline [Z], the more highly 
oxidized (t)-3-methoxyguattescidine 131, and the oxoaporphine 3-methoxyoxoputerine [4]. 
Among several other known alkaloids also found in this same plant, (-)-3-hydroxynorn~tciferine, 
(-)-isoguattouregidine, and argentinine exhibited significant activity against Tiy/~unnsoinu crrizi. 
Gttatteriafoliosa Benth. (Annonaceae), commonly known as “Sayakasi” by the local 
Chimane Indians, was collected in the “Alto-Beni,’’ a tropical region of Bolivia. This 
species, previously known to occur in Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela, has been described 
by Fries in his revision of the genus Grlatteria (2),  and belongs to the section Trichostemon 
together with G. majpirensis, G. trichostemon, and G. polyantha. This tree is used by 
indigenous people as an insect repellent. Its chemical composition is investigated here 
for the first time. 
Preliminary studies carried out by IBBA (Instituto Boliviano de Biologia de Altura) 
and ORSTOM (Institut Français de Recherche Scientifique pour le Développement en 
Coopération) on Gaatteria foliosu extracts demonstrated an interesting antiparasitic 
activity against different strains of Leishinunia spp., responsible for leishmaniasis, and 
against Ttypanosoma crmi, the causative factor of Chagas’s disease. In these studies, four 
extracts were prepared from the stem bark and roots, namely two petroleum ether and 
two alkaloidal extracts. Biological activity was measured in vitro at 100 pg/ml on the 
promastigote form of three species of Leishmania (L. buniliensis, L. amazonensis, L. 
chagasi), and on the epimastigote form of three strains of T~y~anosomacrr~zi (T. c. talahiten, 
c8cl1, and tehwentepec) (Table 1) (3). 
From thestudies, i t  became clear that the neutral extracts were inactive, and that the 
antiprotozoal activity is due to the alkaloids that induce complete lysis of the parasites. 
Fractionation ofthe alkaloid extract ofG~¿atteriafiliosastem barkresulted in the isolation 
of 13 substances, comprised of two neutral compounds and 11 isoquinoline alkaloids. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The powdered stem bark of G. filiosa was extracted by percolation with MeOH. 
Neutral compounds were extracted with hexane and then with CH,CI,. The alkaloids 
were subsequently extracted with CH,Cl, after alkalinization and then subjected to 
chromatographic separation. 
Two known cinnamic acid derivatives, methyl ferulate and methyl sinapate, were 
isolated in low yield from the less polar fractions of the “alkaloid” extract. 
Of the 11 isoquinoline alkaloids isolated, seven were identified as known com- 
pounds, namely, the aporphines (-)-elmerriIlicine (4) ,  (-)-notstephalagine ( 5  ,6), (-)-

Following a classical separation, 1 was obtained as a mixture with (-)-elmerriIlicine 
and (-)-norstephalagine. (-)-ElmerriIlicine was separated from the non-phenolic bases 
by partition between 1N NaOH and &,O. Subsequently, (-)-3-methoxyputerine [l] 
and (-)-norstephalaghe were further separated by prep. hplc under reversed-phase 
conditions. (-)-3-Methoxyputerine [l} presented a molecular weight of 325 daltons, 
corresponding to C,,HI,NO4. The ‘H-nmr spectral data were closely comparable to 
those of (-)-elmertillicine. The main difference lay in the replacement of the OH group 
ar C-11 by a second OMe group appearing at 3.89 ppm. This difference was confirmed 
by the upfield shift of the OCH,O group and by relevant observations in the 13C-nmr 
spectrum. The negative specific rotation was indicarive of a 6aR configuration (16). 
(+)-Norguattevaline [2]  is aphenolic noraporphine substituted with two methoxy 
groups as shown by its uv and nmr spectra( 1 7 ~ 8 ) .  The molecular formula, C,,H,,NO,,, 
indicated the presence of a second hydroxy grOUlJ .  In the ‘H-nmr spectrum, an AMX 
system of three protons pointed to the presence of a monosubstituted ring D. The 
resonance ofH-11 asadoublet at 8.04ppmwas consistent withsubstitutionat C-9(18). 
The singler at 3.67 ppm was typical of a methoxy group at  the C-1 position (18). The 
I3C-nmt chemical shift of the two methoxy groups at 59.8 and 60.7 ppm showed that 
the second methoxy group is also located on ring A, either at C-2 or C-3 (12-15). The 
exact position of the substituents was determined by nOe nmr experiments. Irradiation 
of the C-1 methoxy singlet at 3.67 ppm showed the expected enhancement of the 8.04 
ppm signal representing H-11. On the other hand, irradiation of the methoxy group at 
3.94 ppm had no effect on the aliphatic protons at C-4, which is in agteement with the 
location of the OMe at C-2. 
Alkaloid 3, (+)-3-methoxyguattescidine, was purified by prep. hplc, and was 
obtained as an amorphous dextrorotatory compound. The molecular formulaC,,H,,NO, 
was established from the hrms. The uv spectrum, typical of an aporphine, showed 
bathochromic shifts upon both the addition of base and acid, indicating the phenolic 
nature of this alkaloid and the presence of an imine function (17,18). The ‘H-nmr 
spectrum displayed the typical AX system ofa 1,2-methyIenedioxy group (18), an AMX 
system of three protons assigned to a C-9 monosubstituted ring D, and a singlet at 4.02 
ppm typical ofamethoxy group at C-3 in a trisubstituted ring A. The phenolic OH was 
thus located at C-9. In the aliphatic region, only fout protons were observed instead of 
seven in a sensi1 stricto aporphine. They were assigned to H-4 and H-5 of a 6,623- 
dehydroaporphine disubstituted at C-7 as confirmed by the “C-nmr spectrum. On the 
other hand, the’H-nmt spectrumshowed asinglet at 1.47 ppmconsistentwithamethyl 
group located at C-7, and geminal to an hydroxy group. It has been previously shown 
that the alkaloid ring system is not planar; the biphenyl moiety is twisted by about 20°, 
with the C-7 hydroxy group pseudoequatotial and the C-methyl pseudoaxial (20). 
Two oxoaporphines were isolated during the purification of(-)-3-methoxyputerine 
[l} and (-)-norstephalagine by prep. hplc, and correspond to oxidation products. Their 
uv spectra were Characteristic of oxoaporphine alkaloids; they exhibited two uv absorp- 
tion bands above 350 nm, diagnostic of extensive conjugation (21). The first of these was 
identified as the known atherospetmidine (9). The second, 3-methoxyoxoputerine [4] ,  
exhibited in the mass spectrum a molecular ion at 71zI.z 335 corresponding to the 
elemental formula C,,H,3N0,. The ‘H-nmr spectrum was typical of an oxoaporphine; 
all the signals were shifted downfield, there were no aliphatic protons, and the 
methylenedioxy group resonated as a singlet at 6.24 ppm. The aromatic region showed 
protons H-4 and H-5 at 8.18 ppm and 8.90 ppm, respectively, and three protons of an 
11-monosubstituted ring D. The C-3 and C-1 1 positions were occupied by two methoxy 
groups.

Alkaloids isolated and purified in sufficient amount were tested on four strains of 
Leishiizania spp. (Table 2), under the same conditions as the crude extracts (Table 1) (3). 
Due to the small amount of pure compounds available, only the three major alkaloids 
- could be tested. Isoguattouregidine was the only alkaloid showing any significant 
activity against Leishnania donovani and L. amzzonensis. 
On the other hand, most of the alkaloids were available in sufficient quantities to be 
tested against Trylmzosonza crimi. They were evaluated in the bloodstream form 
(trypomastigote) isolated from a blood sample of T. crmi infected mice (Table 3), as 
described elsewhere (22). This parasite stage is encountered in the bloodstream during 
the acute stage of the disease. The three alkaloids exhibiting significant activity (% lysis 
2 60%) against T. cwzi were identified as the noraporphine, 3-hydroxynornuciferine, 
the 7-hydroxy-7-methyIaporphine, isoguattouregidine, and the aminoethylphenanthrene, 
argentinine. The substantial differences among the three structures did not allow for the 
elaboration of any structure-activity relationships. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES-UV spectra were recorded on a Philips PU 8700 spectropho- 
tometer. All ’H- and ”C-nmr spectra were recorded in CDCI, (6 ppm) on a Bruker AC 200 P spectrometer 
operating at 200 and 50 MMz, respectively. Eims spectra were obtained on a Kratos MS-80 spectrometer. 
PLm” MATERlAL.Stem bark of Gtlntteviafoliosa was collected by A. Fournet (AF 390) in September 
1987, at Fatima de Chiniane, Beni, Bolivia (altitude 350 m). The botanical identification of this species was 
performed by Prof. P.J.M. Maas and Dr. A.M. Polak, at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands. Voucher 
specimens are deposited in the National Herbarium of Bolivia (La Paz) and in the herbarium of the

EXTRACTION.-Extraction method for preliminary biological studies: Dried and powdered roots and 
stem bark (10 g) were macerated with petroleum ether ( S O  ml) for two days. The extractives were filtered 
and evaporated to dryness, affording the petroleum ether extracts. Other samples of the plant material (10 
g) were triturated with N H 4 0 H  and then macerated with CHCI, (SO ml) for two days, leading to the 
alkaloidal extracts. 
Extraction method for alkaloids: powdered stem bark (4 kg) was extracted by percolation with MeOH. 
The MeOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with H 2 0 ,  and the neutral compounds 
were extracted with hexane (residue 12.23 g)  and then with CH,CI, (residue 133.7 g). The aqueous layer, 
alkalinized with NH,OH and extracted with CH,CI,, afforded a CH,C12 extract (17.7 g, 4.8%) containing 
the total alkaloids. 
ISOLI\TION.-The crude CH,Cl,extract (17.7 g) was purified by the usual chromatographic methods 
on Si gel (cc and tlc) followed by reversed-phase prep. hplc when necessary. Si gel GF,,,, was used for tlc, Si 
gel 60 N and 60 H were used for cc. Exclusion chromatography was performed on Sephadex LH-20 using 
CH,CI,-MeOH (2: 1) as solvent. Liquid chromatography consisted of a programmable hplc pump (Waters 
590) and a uv detector (Waters 484) connected to a data module (Waters). Separations were performed on 
pßondapak C-18,lO pm, 125 A column(25X 100 mm)+ guard column. The solvent system was MeOH- 
H,O-HOAc (50:45.5:0.5), with a flow rate of 20 ml/mn, and uv detection at 277 nm.
