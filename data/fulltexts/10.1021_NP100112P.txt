Bioassay-guided fractionation ofa crude extract of the aerial parts of Vassobia breViflora led to the isolation of the withanolide-type steroidal lactonewithaferin A (1). This compound was tested for antiproliferative activity against the head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, MDA1986, JMAR, UM-SCC-2, and JHU011. The inhibitory concentrations to reducecell viability to 50% (IC50) were determined by the MTS cytotoxicity assay, and 1 reduced cell viability with IC50values in the range 0.5-2.2 µM. A mechanistic study showed that 1 induces apoptosis and cell death in HNSCC cellsas well as a cell-cycle shift from G0/G1 to G2/M. Cells treated with 1 exhibited inactivation of Akt and a reduction intotal Akt concentration. This investigation constitutes the first report of the antiproliferative activity of withaferin A (1)against head and neck squamous carcinoma.Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifthmost common cancer in humans and accounts for 90% of all headand neck malignancies, with over 780 000 new cases diagnosedyearly worldwide.1-3 Tumors in this disease may arise from anyof the mucosal surfaces in the head and neck region including thelips and oral cavity, tongue, nasal cavity, oropharynx, larynx, andeven the thyroid gland. Tumors typically will spread lymphaticallyto cervical lymph nodes in the neck. Platinum-based therapy is themost effective drug treatment for HNSCC; however, this treatmentmay lead to significant toxicity, including ototoxicity, peripheralneuropathy, and nephrotoxicity, accounting for up to 15% ofdeaths.4 Despite advances in the diagnosis and staging of advancedHNSCC, survival has not significantly improved in the last 30years,3 and even with aggressive therapy, the majority of suchpatients succumb to recurrent or metastatic disease.5-7 Manypatients, especially the elderly, cannot complete chemo-radiationtreatments, and a significant number of deaths are due to treatment-related toxicity.4 Molecular-targeted therapies are being explored,but thus far have not shown the level of benefit in HNSCC thatthey produce in other forms of cancer.8 Novel drugs discoveredfor this disease, especially from natural product sources, wouldprovide an exciting avenue for preclinical exploration in HNSCC.Natural products have played a significant role in the discoveryand development of new anticancer agents, and they represent arich source of biologically active compounds. More than 79.8% ofanticancer drugs introduced from January 1981 to October 2008were natural products, semisynthetic analogues, or syntheticcompounds based on natural-product pharmacophores.9 A libraryof 200 plant extracts from Latin America was evaluated for theircytotoxic activities against four HNSCC cell lines using the MTSassay. The species selected for this study included one of the mostactive samples from Argentina, Vassobia breViflora (Sendtn.) Hunz(Solanaceae), which is a widespread spiny shrub with small, purple,campanulate, glabrous flowers.10 Although significant antimicrobialactivity of the methanol extract of V. breViflora has been reported,11there has been no chemical isolation work on this species reportedpreviously. Cytotoxicity-guided purification led to the isolation andcharacterization of the active withanolide, withaferin A (1).Withaferin A (1) is a part of the withanolide family ofcompounds. Withanolides are naturally occurring C28-steroidallactones built on an intact or rearranged ergostane scaffold in whichC-22 and C-26 are appropriately oxidized to form a δ-lactone ringon the nine-carbon side chain.12 These polyhydroxy steroids arefound in some species of the Solanaceae, and in particular, theyare abundant and structurally diverse in the genera Acnistus, Datura,Dunalia, Lycium, Jaborosa, Physalis, and especially Withania.12,13Withanolides are reported to possess various biological activitiesin vitro and in vivo including antimicrobial,14 antineoplastic andcytotoxic,15-21 anti- neurodegenerative,20 anti-inflammatory,22-25and radiosensitizing,26 as well as immunomodulating, antioxidant,antistress, cardiotonic, and insect antifeedant properties.13,26Compound 1 was isolated earlier from Withania somnifera Dunal,a medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment ofvarious ailments such as arthritis, asthma, hypertension, andrheumatism. Its structure was elucidated in 1965 and is characterizedby an R,-unsaturated ketone in ring A, an epoxide group in ringB, and an R,-unsaturated lactone in its side chain.12 Withaferin A(1) has been the object of many studies and considered as a possibleagent for use in cancer therapy because of its potential antitumoractivity.13 This compound is reported to show cytotoxicity in avariety of tumor cells including breast,15 pancreatic,17 prostate,19lung,27 and leukemia.28Although recent studies have demonstrated that 1 suppresses thegrowth of human cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo by causingapoptosis,15-17 the precise mechanism, including the signals andthe pathways by which 1 induces cell death, is not fully understood.The present study was undertaken to assess for the first time theefficacy of 1 against several malignant head and neck squamouscell carcinoma cell lines and to broaden the understanding of itsmechanism of action in these cells.* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Prod. 2010, 73, 1476–1481147610.1021/np100112p  2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosyPublished on Web 08/20/2010Results and DiscussionThe isolation process of 1 from V. breViflora was guided bybioassay, and at each stage of purification, fractions obtained werescreened for their cytotoxic activities for JMAR, MDA1986, UM-SCC-2, and JHU011 human HNSCC cells using the MTS assay.The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the most activefraction at each step of the isolation is summarized in Table S1(Supporting Information). The concentration-dependent cell vi-abilities for application of 1 to head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma are shown in Figure 1. Withaferin A reduced cell viabilityof HNSCC cell lines and inhibited their growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values for UM-SCC-2, MDA1986,JMAR, and JHU011 cells were 0.5, 0.8, 2.0, and 2.2 µM,respectively. The results showed that these four cell lines are verysensitive to treatment with compound 1.A series of experiments evaluating cell-cycle arrest and theapoptotic pathway were performed in order to investigate a possiblemechanism for the antiproliferative effect of 1. As shown in Figure2, treatment of MDA1986, JMAR, UM-SCC-2, and JHU011HNSCC cells with 3.0 µM 1 for 24 h induced a significant cellcycle shift from the G0/G1 to the G2/M phase, from 27% to 42% inJMAR cells (Figure 2A) and from 26% to 49% in MDA1986 cells(Figure 2B; p < 0.01). The G2/M phase shift for UM-SCC-2 cellswas from 27% to 36% (Figure 2C) and for JHU011 cells, 25% to34% (Figure 2D, p < 0.01). Compound 1 additionally induced Sphase arrest in JMAR, MDA1986, and UM-SCC-2 cells. Treatmentwith 1 also led to an increase in sub-G0 levels in both JMAR (from2% to 12%; p < 0.01) and MDA1986 cells (from 7% to 8%; notsignificant), suggesting that JMAR cells underwent DNA fragmen-tation, one of the early biochemical events leading to apoptosis.In order to confirm the apoptotic action induced by 1, cells weretreated with 5.0 µM 1 for 24 h and stained with annexinV/propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Figure 3, treatment ofHNSCC cells with 1 increased the annexin V-positive cells. AnnexinV-only staining signified the early apoptotic events, whereas dualannexin V and PI staining indicated the late phase of apoptosis.Treatment of JHU011 cells with 1 induced early apoptotic events(p < 0.01) significantly from basal levels of 4.8% to 14.8%. Therewas a slight increase in the late phase of apoptosis induced by 1 inJHU011 cells, with very small PI-only staining (necrosis) observedin JHU011 cells treated with 1. Treatment of JMAR and UM-SCC-2cells with 1 induced significant increases in early and late apoptosisas well as necrosis (p < 0.01). MDA1986 cells seemed less sensitiveto treatment with 1, since withaferin A did not increase annexinV/PI staining herein.To confirm the annexin V studies on HNSCC cells, caspase 3activation was investigated in HNSCC (Figure 4). Treatment ofJHU011 cells induced activation of the caspase 3 enzyme, assignified by decreased procaspase 3 levels. In addition, the caspase3 substrate PARP was cleaved upon treatment with 1, in aconcentration-dependent manner (Figure 4). Treatment with com-pound 1 at 1.0 µM increased PARP cleavage in JHU011 cells.JMAR cells treated with 1 also showed a similar decreases inprocaspase 3 levels and cleavage of PARP protein in a concentra-tion-dependent fashion. Similar results were also observed whenUM-SCC-2 cells were treated with 1. Treatment of MDA1986 cellswith withaferin A increased caspase 3 activation and PARPcleavage. However, in line with the annexin V/PI data, a slightlyhigher concentration of 1 was required to induce caspase 3activation in MDA1986 cells (Figure 4). These results indicate that1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and apoptosis wasconfirmed by positive annexin V/PI staining as well as caspase 3activation in the HNSCC cell lines investigated. At this point, it isnot clear whether G2/M cell cycle arrest provides conditionsconducive to caspase 3 activation.The effect of withaferin A (1) was examined on major prosurvivalsignaling pathways in HNSCC cells including PI3 kinase/Akt andERK1/2 MAP kinase. These data showed that 1 reduced phospho-rylation (ser473) as well as total Akt levels in all HNSCC cells ina concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5). Treatment of JHU011,JMAR, and UM-SCC-2 cells with as low as 100-250 nMconcentrations of 1 reduced Akt phosphorylation (ser473). It isinteresting to note that a higher concentration of 1 was required toinhibit Akt activity in MDA1986 cells (2.5 µM). In addition to theeffect of 1 on the reduction of phosphorylated Akt, the total Aktlevels were decreased significantly in all cell lines examined (Figure5). These data show that 1 is a strong Akt inhibitor in HNSCCcells. The effect of 1 was examined on ERK1/2 activation inHNSCC cells. Withaferin A increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2MAP kinase in JHU011, JMAR, and MDA1986 cells. Only athigher concentrations did 1 inhibit activation of ERK1/2 in UM-SCC-2 cells. Withaferin A had no effect on total ERK1/2 levels.In the present study, a plant extract as well as purified 1 from V.breViflora potently decreased cell viability of head and necksquamous carcinoma cell lines MDA1986, JMAR, UM-SCC-2, andJHU011 cells using the MTS assay. The IC50 concentration of thisinhibitor ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 µM among the HNSCC cell linesused, indicating a potent antiproliferative effect. Compound 1reduced cell viability at submicromolar concentrations in UM-SCC-2 and MDA1986 cells. However, the head and neck squamouscell lines used displayed differential sensitivities to 1, with UM-SCC-2 cells demonstrating a significantly higher sensitivity to 1than the other cell lines. Compound 1 induced a shift in cell cyclearrest from G0/G1 arrest to the S and G2/M phase. In addition, cellcycle arrest studies exhibited a significant increase in the subG0fraction, indicating a likely early-DNA fragmentation event due totreatment with 1. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of annexinV/PI staining in treated cells in Figure 3 showed that 1 induced asignificant level of apoptosis in these cells. Western blot analysisstudies of activation caspase 3 confirmed the annexin V/PI data.Cell cycle arrest at mitosis seemed to be greatest in JMAR cellswith a correspondingly lower requirement for 1 for induction ofcaspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage, whereas MDA1986 cellsexhibited a relatively smaller G2/M shift and showed relativeresistance to caspase 3 activation. In addition, western blotting datademonstrated that the antiproliferative action of 1 could be in partexplained through a decrease in activation of Akt as well as thedegradation of total Akt levels. Compound 1 at submicromolarconcentrations reduced Akt phosphorylation (ser473) in JMAR,JHU011, and UM-SCC-2 cells, whereas 1 at slightly higher than1.0 µM was required for inhibition of Akt phosphorylation inMDA1986 cells. Further study is required to elucidate the upstreameffect of 1 in the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway as well as downstreamevents that may induce apoptosis upon Akt inhibition in HNSCCFigure 1. Withaferin A (1) is an antiproliferative agent for theJHU011, JMAR, MDA1986, and UM-SCC-2 head and necksquamous cell lines. The MTS assay was used to study the effectof 1 on cell viability of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells.All experiments were performed in triplicate for each concentration.Cytotoxic Steroid from Vassobia breViflora Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 9 1477cells. In addition, Akt may phosphorylate and inhibit caspaseactivation, and this may include initiator caspases (for example,caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) which in turn, proteolytically cleave andactivate effector (executioner) caspases (for example, caspase-3,-6, and -7).29 Therefore, HNSCC cells (for example MDA1986)that are relatively resistant to withaferin A (1)-mediated Aktinhibition may therefore require higher levels of 1 to inhibit Aktand in turn activate caspases.In conclusion, this is the first report to date of the presence ofwithaferin A in Vassobia breViflora, and this species has beendemonstrated as a new source for the production of 1. Extracts, aswell as pure 1, reduced cell viability in all four head and necksquamous carcinoma cell lines in vitro. This mechanism of actionis in part a result of G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosisin HNSCC cells. Compound 1 inhibited activation of Akt andreduced total Akt levels. Additional studies will be required toevaluate the potential of application of the active compound 1 forfuture anticancer drug development in head and neck squamouscarcinoma.Experimental SectionGeneral Experimental Procedures. HPLC was conducted on anAgilent Technologies 1200 series system. IR data were obtained usinga Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR instrument. NMR spectra wererecorded on either a Bruker DRX-400 with a qnp probe or a BruderAV-500 with a cryoprobe. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded using theresidual protonated signal in the CDCl3 solvent (δH 7.24) or the centralpeak of the CDCl3 triplet (δC 77.00) as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectrometry data were collected on a LCT Premiertime-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Normal-phase TLC was performed on Sorbent Technologies Silica G TLC platesFigure 2. Compound 1 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HNSCC cells. JMAR (A) MDA1986 (B), UM-SCC-2 (C), and JHU011 (D) cellswere treated with DMSO or 3.0 µM 1. Cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) were primarily at the G0/G1 phase, while cells treated withcompound 1 showed shifts from the G0/G1 to the S and G2/M phases.1478 Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 9 Samadi et al.(200 µm, w/UV 254) using the solvent system DCM-EtOAc-MeOH(1:8:1), and reversed-phase TLC was performed on Sorbent Technolo-gies C18 TLC plates (150 µm, w/UV 254) using H2O-MeOH (1:1).Spots were visualized using UV light (254 nm) and spraying withvanillin-sulfuric acid reagent.Plant Material. Aerial parts of V. breViflora were collected by R.Fortunato and A. Cabral along highway RN 86, 2 km northeast ofPrimavera, Department Patino, Province of Formosa, Argentina (lat.25°14′0′′ S, long. 57°57′0′′ W) in November 1999. A voucher specimen(No. ARP 612) prepared by R. Fortunato was deposited in theHerbarium (BAB) of the Institute of Biological Resources, NationalInstitute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Castelar, Buenos Aires,Argentina. Intellectual Property Rights Agreements for plant collectionsand interdisciplinary research were executed between the collaboratinginstitutions in the U.S. and Argentina.Extraction and Isolation. Dried, ground biomass (100 g) wasextracted at room temperature with CH2Cl2-MeOH (50:50) three times.The concentrated extract (9.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH-H2O (10:90) followed by partition with n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-butanol. TheEtOAc extract (2.65 g) was subjected to silica gel column chromatog-raphy (32-60 µm, 5 × 60 cm) and eluted with gradient mixtures ofCH2Cl2-MeOH (100:0, 98:2, 95:5, 93:7, 90:10, 80:20, 50:50, and0:100), in order of increasing polarity. A total of 182 fractions werecollected, and fractions 49-54 (830.3 mg; CH2Cl2-MeOH, 93:7) werecombined and further purified by normal-phase SPE (20 g; 60 mL)using a step gradient of CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures (90:10, 85:15, 80:20, 75:25, 70:30, 65:35, 60:40, 50:50, and 0:100). Among nine collectedfractions, 50 mg of withaferin A (1) was obtained in the most activefraction, 5 (CH2Cl2-MeOH 70:30). The identity of withaferin A (1;Figure 3. Withaferin A (1) induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. HNSCC cells were treated with5.0 µM 1 for 24 h and then harvested and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide followed by analysis by flow cytometry. Allexperiments were performed in triplicate. Treatment with 1 exhibited an increase in annexin V and PI staining that indicated early as wellas late apoptotic events. JMAR cells treated with 1 showed significant necrosis.Figure 4. Caspase 3 was activated in head and neck squamouscell carcinoma cells treated with withaferin A (1). HNSCC cellswas treated with different concentrations of 1 for 24 h. Levels ofpro-caspase 3 (inactive form) were examined with the antibodyagainst uncleaved caspase 3. In addition, activation of caspase 3was examined with levels of the uncleaved and cleaved caspase 3substrate, PARP. Compound 1 induced caspase 3 activation in allHNSCC cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner.Cytotoxic Steroid from Vassobia breViflora Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 9 147994.8% purity by HPLC) was determined by a combination of 1D and2D NMR, HR-MS, IR, and X-ray diffraction data, which were inaccordance with values reported in the literature,30,31 and cochromatog-raphy done with an authentic sample purchased from Chromadex(Irvine, CA; see Supporting Information). Withaferin A (1) was solublein chloroform but not in ethyl acetate. Colorless, block-shape crystalsof 1 were obtained from a mixture of chloroform and ethyl acetate(ratio 1:2). The purity of the final 1 was determined to be 95% byHPLC analysis according to a method previously reported.13Bioassay Materials. Culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS),penicillin G, streptomycin, MEM-nonessential amino acids, ribonucleaseA, and propidium iodide (PI) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO). MEM-vitamin solution was purchased from Life Tech-nologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). MTS reagents were obtained fromPromega Co (Madison, WI). Annexin V-FITC was from BD Bioscience(Bedford, MA). Primary antibodies against total ERK and -actin andsecondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit antibodies werepurchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primaryantibodies against phospho-Akt, total-Akt, phospho-ERK, caspase 3,and PARP were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly,MA). BCA protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce (Rockford,IL). Protease inhibitor mixture set II was obtained from Calbiochem(San Diego, CA).Cell Culture and Media. The invasive oral squamous carcinomacell lines JMAR and MDA1986 were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Myers(University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center; Houston, TX).The head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line UM-SCC-2 was agift from Dr. Scott Weed (University of West Virginia, Morgantown,WV). They were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, a 2-fold MEM-vitamin solution, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The laryngeal squa-mous carcinoma cell line JHU-011 was kindly donated by Dr. JosephCalifano (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). This was culturedin RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Adherent monolayer cultures were maintained on plasticplates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Cytotoxicity Assay. The experiment was performed by the MTS[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sul-fophenyl)-2H tetrazolium] assay according to the manufacturer’sinstructions. In brief, 1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)and then diluted with culture media to prepare serial concentrations,while the controls received only DMSO (<0.1%, v/v). The cells wereseeded in 96-well microtiter plates (2 × 103 cells/well) in 100 µL ofgrowth medium. After incubation for 24 h, varying levels of plantextracts or 1 were added to each well and incubated for 72 h. Then, 20µL of MTS solution was added. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C (5%CO2), absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader.Percent viability was calculated as a fraction of the negative control(culture medium only), with data plotted as a function of percent cellviability versus concentration of 1. The half-maximal inhibitoryconcentration (IC50) was obtained from the MTS viability curves usingGraphPad Prism 5. All studies were performed in triplicate. In parallelwith wells of the test samples, negative control wells with predeterminedcell numbers were used to normalize the absorbance readings and toprovide internal confirmation that the assay was linear over the rangeof absorbance and cell numbers measured. Cisplatin at variousconcentrations was used as a positive control in the MTS cytotoxicityassay.Western Blot Analysis. After treatment cells were lysed (0.5%Nonidet P-40, 100 mM, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1:500 protease inhibitormixture set II, 1 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and lysateswere placed on ice for 20 min. Clear lysates were obtained bycentrifugation (14000g for 20 min). Equal amounts of protein wereseparated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a Hybond nitrocel-lulose membrane (Amersham). The membranes were blocked andprobed with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody overnight at4 °C. The blots were washed three times in PBS-Tween-20 for 10min and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondaryantibody in PBS-Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 h. After washingin PBS-Tween-20, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemi-luminescence reagent (Amersham) and captured on Kodak XAR-5 film(Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Where indicated, the blots werereprobed with antibody against -actin to ensure equal loading andtransfer of proteins.Cell-Cycle Arrest Study. After treatment, cells were trypsinizedand 1 × 106 cells were washed with 0.9% NaCl and fixed with 70%cold ethanol in 0.9% NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. Aftercentrifugation (700g; 5 min) cells were stained with propidium iodide(50 µg/mL in PBS) for 30 min. Then, cells were treated with DNase-free RNase (1 mg/mL) for 30 min and analyzed by a Becton DickinsonLSRII flow cytometer.Apoptosis Analysis. In order to evaluate the induction of apoptosis,cells were costained with annexin V/PI and analyzed using flowcytometry. An analysis of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet ofapoptotic cell membranes was performed using annexin V-FITC andPI to distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells. After treatment,cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) were stained with annexin-V and PI accordingto the manufacturer’s instruction (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA).To each tube was added 400 µL of 1× annexin binding buffer, andFigure 5. Compound 1 modulated prosurvival signal transduction pathway. HNSCC cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 1for 24 h. Total levels of phospho-Akt, total Akt, phospho-ERK, and total ERK2 were determined by western blotting. Antibody against-actin was used as a protein loading control. Compound 1 reduced Akt activation as well as total cellular Akt, while ERK1/2 was activatedin JHU011, JMAR, and MDA1986 cells and ERK1/2 activity decreased in UM-SCC-2 cells at a high concentration of 1. Total ERK levelsremained unchanged when cells were treated with compound 1.1480 Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 9 Samadi et al.stained cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD LSRII; BectonDickinson, San Diego, CA).Statistical Methods.
