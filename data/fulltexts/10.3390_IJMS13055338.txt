Abstract: The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) leads to a number 
of cellular changes associated with the development of long-term memory. Using cultured 
cortical neurons, we previously showed that the n-hexane extract prepared from the peels 
of Citrus grandis (Kawachi bankan) induces the activation of ERK1/2 and that one of the 
compounds with this ability in the extract is 3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), a 
Citrus polymethoxyflavone. In fact, we found that HMF has the ability to rescue mice from 
drug-induced  learning  impairment.  This  hexane  extract  contains  auraptene  (AUR),  a 
coumarin derivative with a monoterpene unit, together with HMF. The present study was 
designed to investigate the effect of AUR in vitro. Our results show that 1) AUR had the 
ability to induce the activation of ERK1/2 in not only cortical neurons but also the rat 
pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells), which is a model system for studies on neuronal 
proliferation and differentiation; and 2) AUR had the ability to promote neurite outgrowth 
from PC12 cells.

1. Introduction 
Extracellular  signal-regulated  kinases  1/2  (ERK1/2)  are  components  of  the  mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Recent studies have shown that ERK1/2 are involved in 
synaptic  plasticity  and  in  the  development  of  long-term  memory  in  the  central  nervous  system  
(CNS) [1,2]. In order to search for Citrus compounds beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
neurological  disorders,  we  previously  screened  some  Citrus  extracts  by  evaluating  their  ability  to 
activate  ERK1/2 in  cultured cortical  neurons  [3]. Consequentially,  we  found that  1) the n-hexane 
extract of Citrus grandis (Kawachi bankan) has the ability to activate ERK1/2; 2) this extract contains 3 
polymethoxyflavones  (3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxyflavone,  HMF;  nobiletin  [5,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxy 
flavone],  NBT;  and  tangeretin  [5,6,7,8,4′-pentamethoxyflavone],  TGN)  and  1  coumarin  derivative 
(auraptene, 7-geranyloxycoumarin; AUR); and 3) one of the active compounds is HMF. In that study 
we also extensively investigated in vitro the ERK1/2-activating effect of HMF in comparison with that 
of  NBT  and  TGN,  and  then  found  that  HMF  administered  to  mice  treated  with  NMDA  receptor 
antagonist MK-801 restores the MK-801-induced deterioration of spatial learning performance in the 
Morris water-maze task. On the other hand, there are few in vitro or in vivo studies about the effect of 
AUR on the CNS. In the present study, we thus sought to determine whether AUR, like HMF, would 
have the ability to activate ERK1/2 in neuronal cells. Here, we successfully showed that AUR could 
activate  (namely  phosphorylate)  ERK1/2  in  not  only  cultured  cortical  neurons  but  also  rat  PC12 
pheochromocytoma cells. 
AUR is a simple coumarin bearing a geranyloxyl moiety at its C-7 (Figure 1). AUR is a major 
coumarin of Citrus plants, and has been found in not only C. grandis (Kawachi bankan) but also 
various Citrus fruits such as grapefruit (Citrus paradise) [4]. Numerous studies have indicated that 
AUR  has  valuable  effects  on  various  biological  functions  in  the  peripheral  tissues,  including  
anti-inflammatory  activity  [5,6],  anti-carcinogenic  activity  [7,8],  anti-helicobacter  activity  [9],  and 
regulatory activity on hepatic lipid metabolism [10,11]. On the contrary, there has been only 1 report 
describing  the  effect  of  AUR  on  the  CNS:  AUR  as  well  as  7-isopentenyloxycoumarin  exerts  a 
protective  effect  against  NMDA-induced  excitatory  neurotoxicity  in  mixed  cortical  cell  cultures 
(composed of neurons and astrocytes) [12]. Excitotoxicity is known to be correlated with various 
neuronal disorders such as acute brain injury, chronic neurodegeneration (Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s 
diseases), epilepsy, spinal cord trauma, ischemic stroke, etc. [13], thus suggesting AUR is a novel 
neuroprotective agent.

In the present study, we found that AUR effectively activated ERK1/2 in PC12 cells. These cells are 
a useful model system for  the study of neuronal differentiation. The exposure of these cells to nerve 
growth  factor  (NGF) ,  one  of  the  neurotrophic  factors,  triggers  their  differentiation  into  
sympathetic-like neuronal cells [14]. PC12 cells express specific receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkA) on Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

their  surface.  NGF  induces  rapid  tyrosine  phophorylation  of  TrkA  and  consequent 
phosphorylation/activation of signal transduction substrates including ERK1/2 [15,16]. NGF-mediated 
ERK activation induces phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [17]. 
Activated  CREB  then  recruits  the  CREB  binding  protein  (CBP)  to  the  promoter  regions  of  
cAMP-responsive  genes  associated  with  dendritic  spine  growth,  morphology  change,  synaptic 
plasticity and long-term memory [17,18]. Namely, the activation of ERK1/2 by NGF can cause the 
neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. Similar to the effect of NGF, various other stimuli such as cyclic 
AMP, calcium influx [15], depolarization [19], and some phytochemicals such as flavonoids [20] can 
lead to neurite outgrowth via phosphorylation of ERK. We thus also examined whether or not AUR 
could stimulate the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Here, we successfully observed that AUR 
promoted  neurite  outgrowth  from  PC12  cells.  It  is  noteworthy  that  this  is  the  first  report  on  the 
neurotrophic action of AUR. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Cultures of Rat Neurons 
Neurons  were  prepared  from  the  neocortices  of  Wistar  rats  (Nippon  SLC,  Shizuoka, Japan)  at 
embryonic day 18, as previously described [3]. Neurobasal medium
 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 
containing B27 supplement (1/50 volume; Invitrogen), glutamine (2 mM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, 
NY, USA), penicillin (100 U/mL; Gibco BRL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL; Gibco BRL) was used 
for the neuronal cultures. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was purchased from Pepro Tech. 
(Rocky Hill, NJ, USA); and AUR, from LKT Lab (St. Paul, MN, USA). HMF was prepared from 
commercial  orange  oil  (Wako,  Osaka,  Japan),  as  previously  described  [3].  AUR  and  HMF  were 
dissolved  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  to  yield  100  mM  stock  solutions  and  diluted  to  a  final 
concentration of 100 μM for use in the experiments. 
2.2. Cultures of PC12 Cells 
PC12 cells were obtained from Y. Hayashi (Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan). The 
floating cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 
10% horse serum (HS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco 
BRL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin  (100 μg/mL). For the experiments, the cells were 
seeded into culture vessels precoated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). For evaluation of the neurotrophic 
effect of NGF and/or test compounds, the culture medium must be shifted to low serum-containing 
medium to induce transition from the proliferation phase to the differentiation one. The medium was 
thus shifted to low-serum medium (2% HS and 1% FBS) after an adequate incubation period. Mouse 
NGF 2.5S (Grade I) was purchased from Alomone Labs Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). U0126 and H89 were 
obtained from Calbiochem Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). 
2.3. Immunoblot Analysis 
The cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2 ×  10
5 cells/well), cultured for 48 h in normal-serum 
medium, and then for 48 h in low-serum medium. The cells were subsequently incubated with test Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

compounds for the desired times. The cell extracts were prepared as previously described [21], and 
then equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting. The antibodies and their 
sources were the following: rabbit antibody against MAPK 1/2 (Erk1/2-CT), which recognizes the  
C-terminal 35 amino acids of the rat 44-kDa MAPK1/ERK1 and 42-kDa MAPK2/ERK2, from Upstate 
(Lake Placid, NY, USA); rabbit antibody against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), which 
recognizes phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), rabbit antibodies against CREB and phosphorylated 
CREB (Ser-133),  from  Cell Signaling (Woburn, MA,  USA); horseradish  peroxidase (HRP)-linked 
anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody, from Cell Signaling. The blots were developed by use of the 
chemiluminescence method with Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham, Piscataway, 
NJ, USA). 
2.4. Assessment of Process Formation 
PC12 cells seeded into 24-well plates (1.5 ×  10
4 cells/well) were cultured in normal-serum medium, 
and then incubated for 24 h in low-serum medium containing test compounds. Neurite outgrowth was 
determined  by  manually  tracing  the  length  of  the  longest  neurite  of  each  of  50  cells  in  a  field  
(200×   magnification)  under  observation  with  a  phase-contrast  microscope  (Biozero,  Keyence,  
Osaka, Japan). 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. AUR-Induced ERK Activation in Cortical Neurons 
We previously showed that an n-hexane extract (225 mg) of Citrus grandis yields AUR (39 mg), 
HMF (8.5 mg), TGN (2.7 mg), and NBT (1.1 mg) and that HMF, TGN, and NBT have the ability to 
cause the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured cortical neurons [3]. Although AUR is the most 
prevalent component of the n-hexane extract of C. grandis, its ability to activate ERK had not yet been 
examined. Therefore, we first tested by immunoblot analysis whether AUR had the ability to promote 
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured neurons. When the cells were treated with 100 μM AUR 
for 30 min, ERK1/2 were phosphorylated, as was the case with treatment with 100 μM HMF or BDNF 
at 50 ng/mL (Figure 2A). These results show that AUR as well as HMF and BDNF had the ability to  
phosphorylate ERK1/2. 
We then treated the cells  with  100 μM  AUR for various  periods of times  (0, 10, 30, 60,  and  
90  min).  As  shown  previously,  neurons  express  both  ERK1  and  ERK2,  both  of  which  are 
phosphorylated in response to BDNF or Citrus compounds [3], but only the ERK2 isoform has been 
suggested to be attributable to neurogenesis and cognitive function [1]. We therefore analyzed the ratio 
of phosphorylated ERK2 (pERK2) to total ERK2 (ERK2). Figure 2B shows that the AUR-induced 
phosphorylation  of  ERK2  in  neurons  occurred in a time-dependent manner.  Enhancement  began  at  
10 min, and a maximal increase was observed at 30 min, which was then followed by a gradual decline 
(closed circles). In contrast, when the cells were cultured in medium containing 100 μM HMF, the 
signal was gradually strengthened until at least 90 min after the start of exposure (open squares). 
BDNF caused rapid phosphorylation of ERK2 within 10 min (closed triangle). These observations 
indicated  that  AUR  had  a  unique  time-course  of  ERK1/2-phosphorylation  compared  to  HMF  and Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

BDNF.  Significant  toxicity  of  AUR  was  not  detected  even  after  incubation  for  90  min  at  a  
concentration of 100 μM.

for various times (0, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min) or with BDNF (50 ng/mL) for 10 min The

expressed as 1 arbitrary unit. Results represent mean ±  SEM (n = 4, different cultures).

3.2. AUR-Induced ERK Activation in PC12 Cells 
We then examined the effect of AUR on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PC12 cells, because 
these cells are often used for studies on neuronal differentiation [22]. Cells were treated with 3 or  
30 μM AUR for 30 min or with 50 ng/mL NGF for 10 min. As shown in Figure 3A, AUR increased 
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PC12 cells (at a concentration of 3 μM ERK1/2 phosphorylation 
was slightly increased, and at 30 μM strongly increased). NGF, a positive control substance, markedly 
increased the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2. 
ERK1/2 activation is known to lead to a number of cellular changes, such as the expression of 
CREB  before  any  morphological  change  [17].  We  thus  examined  the  effect  of  AUR  on  the 
phosphorylation of CREB in PC12 cells. As shown in Figure 3B, AUR-induced phosphorylation of 
CREB correlated well with that of ERK. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13                       
 
 
5343 
It is known that NGF induces the activation (phosphorylation) of MEK (MAPK kinase) 1/2, which 
then phosphorylates ERK1/2 [22]. Therefore, the effect of a MEK inhibitor (U0126) on AUR-induced 
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was next evaluated. As shown in Figure 3C, pretreatment of PC12 cells for 
30 min with U0126 abolished the AUR-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. U0126 itself had  no 
effect on the basal of ERK1/2-phosphorylation (data not shown). This result indicates that AUR, as 
well as NGF, could activate MEK1/2, resulting in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. 
Cross talk exists between cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and ERK signaling pathways in 
PC12 cells [23]. The effect of a PKA inhibitor (H89) on AUR-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 
was next evaluated. As also shown in Figure 3C, the AUR-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was 
not  affected  by  H89,  suggesting  that  AUR  could  activate  ERK/CREB  via  a  MEK-dependent  and  
PKA-independent pathway.

concentrations  (0,  3,  and  30  μM)  of  AUR  for  30  min  or  nerve  growth  factor  (NGF,

analysis; (C) Cells were left untreated or were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μM U0126, a 
MEK inhibitor, or with 10 μM H89, a PKA inhibitor, and then incubated for 30 min with

3.3. Effect of AUR on Neuronal Differentiation of PC12 Cells 
It  is  known  that  neurite  outgrowth  from  PC12  cells  is  induced  via  the  phosphorylation  of  
ERK1/2 [23]. We thus determined whether AUR could induce the neurite outgrowth from these cells. 
The  extent  of  PC12  differentiation  is  typically  evaluated  by  counting  the  number  of  cells  with 
extending neurites or by measuring neurite length. 
To  elucidate  the  effects  of  AUR  on  neurite  outgrowth,  we  incubated  PC12  cells  on  
poly-L-lysine-coated culture vessels with various concentrations of AUR (0, 10, 30, and 50 μM) or 
NGF (50 ng/mL) for 24 h or 48 h, and then measured the length of the longest neurite of each of  
50 cells in a phase-contrast microscope field. Our preliminary study indicated that the addition of NGF 
(30–50 ng/mL) for 24–96 h caused a robust outgrowth of neurite from PC12 cells in a time dependent 
manner on collagen-coated culture vessels (data not shown) as previously indicated [24]. We used the Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13                       
 
 
5344 
poly-L-lysine-coated  culture  vessels  in  the  present  study  because  the  PC12  cells  were  likely  to 
aggregate  and  come  off  from  the  substrates  when  cells  were  cultured  on  collagen-coated  culture 
vessels. When cells were cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated culture vessels, the cells could disperse and 
attach well, but not extend long and robust neurites. 
As shown in Figure 4, PC12 cells grown in normal medium were round in shape with few neurites 
(Figure 4A-a and open bar of Figure 4B; 6.69 ±  0.213 μm). NGF treatment resulted in remarkable 
neurite outgrowth (Figure 4A-b and shaded bar of Figure 4B; 15.6 ±  0.941 μm). Figure 4B shows that 
AUR  treatment  for  24  h  induced  neurite  extensions  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  (closed  bars).  
Figure 4A-c, which is a phase-contrast photomicrograph of PC12 cells after treatment with 30 μM 
AUR, shows that AUR induced the formation of short neurites (8.74 ±  0.386 μm) by the cells. The 
neurite  length  of  the  cells  treated  with  NGF  (50  ng/mL)  or  AUR  (30  μM)  for  48  h  was  
17.0 ±  0.746 μm and 10.0 ±  0.562 μm, respectively, which were a little larger than the levels after  
24 h of treatment. 
Figure 4. Effects of AUR on neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. Cells were treated with 
various concentrations (0, 10, 30, and 50 μM) of AUR or NGF (50 ng/mL) for 24 h, after 
which phase-contrast photomicrographs of the cells were taken (A): a, control; b, treatment 
with NGF; c, treatment with 30 μM AUR. Scale bar = 20 μm. (B): The average radial 
distance of the longest neurite, measured from the neurite tip to the soma, of 50 cells was

Recent studies on the mechanism of neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells have provided evidence for 
the  roles  of  a  number  of  different  signaling  molecular  pathways  in  neuronal  differentiation.  For 
example, NBT induces neurite outgrowth of PC12D cells, which were subcloned from the original 
PC12 cells, by activating a cAMP/PKA/MEK/ERK-dependent pathway [25]. Selenium compounds 
such as ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one), which is artificially synthesized, stimulate 
neurite  outgrowth  from  PC12  cells  via  activation  of  Akt  and  ERK  [26].  Scoparone  
(6,7-dimethoxycoumarin),  which  is  frequently  produced  by  infected  plants,  can  induce  neurite 
outgrowth from PC12 cells by stimulating the upstream steps of ERK, PKA, protein kinase C (PKC), 
and  Ca
2+/calmodulin  kinase  II  (CaMK  II)  [27].  Curcuminoids,  the  predominant  polyphenolic 
compounds  in  the  rhizome  of  Curcuma  longa  Linn,  promote  neurite  outgrowth  from  PC12  cells 
through ERK- and PKC-dependent pathways [28]. 5-Hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone, an 
hydroxylated polymethoxyflavone from Citrus plants, promotes neurite outgrowth from these cells via 
the  cAMP/PKA/CREB  pathway  [29].  The  AUR-triggered  mechanism  that  underlies  the  ERK 
activation in and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is not yet clearly understood. In the future, the 
signaling  pathway  responsible  for  the  AUR-induced  neurite  outgrowth  from  PC12  cells  should  
be investigated. 
4. Conclusions 
This study demonstrates that AUR from Citrus plants had the ability to induce activation of ERK1/2 
and CREB in cultured neurons and PC12 cells. AUR also had the ability to induce neurite outgrowth 
from  PC12  cells.  These  results  suggest  that  AUR  might  be  a  neurotrophic  agent  for  treating
