Introduction
Stemodia Benth. is one of Scrophulariaceae genus and 
occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.1 
Although Stemodia comprises about 40 species, the 
chemical investigation of this genus is restricted to five 
species4 from which flavonoids,2,3 labdane diterpenes4,5 and 
diterpenes derivatives with a rare tetracyclic skeletal, named 
stemodane, were isolated. This later class of diterpenes 
seems to be chemomarkers of Stemodia.6 
S. maritima Linn. is a very common shrub that widely 
grows in Northeast Region of Brazil, near the sea coast, 
where it is known as “melosa”. It has been used to treat 
stomachache, dropsy and swelling by local population, 
although toxic symptoms was reported in cattle.7 Stemodane 
diterpenes, including glycosides derivatives, possessing 
antiviral and cytotoxic properties were isolated from this 
species.6,8-10 The chemical composition and larvicidal 
activity of its essential oil were recently reported.11
On the course of the phytochemical investigation of 
S. maritima from the Northeast Region of Brazil, herein 
we report the non-volatile composition of this species. 
A new diterpene, (5S*,8S*,9R*,10S*)-11β,12β-epoxy-
9α-hydroxy-19(4→3)abeo-abieta-3,13-diene-19,18-olide 
(1), together with the known compounds stemodin (2) 
(Figure 1), D-mannitol, betulinic acid, a mixture of 
3β-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-sitosterol and 3β-O-β-D-
glucopyranosylstigmasterol, and 5,7,4’-trihydroxy-3,8,3’-
trimethoxyflavone were isolated from the leaves and stems 
of this plant. Structural elucidation of all compounds was 
Diterpene and other Constituents from Stemodia maritima (Scrophulariaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1582
based on the interpretation of spectral data, meanly NMR 
(1D and 2D) and MS, and comparison with literature data.
Results and Discussion
The molecular formula of compound 1 was established 
through HR-ESI-MS, which showed the quasi-molecular 
ion peak at m/z 331.1799 ([M+1]+, corresponding to the 
molecular formula C20H26O4 and indicating eight degrees 
of unsaturation. EIMS from 1 showed the molecular ion 
peak at m/z 330 (C20H26O4, 5%) and additional peaks at 
m/z 315 (C19H23O4, 7%) and m/z 287 [C17H19O4, 100%], 
attributed to fragments 1a and 1b, respectively (Figure 2). 
The presence of a hydroxyl absorption (ν
max 
3433 cm-1) and 
an α,β-unsatured-γ-lactone (ν
max 
1729 cm-1) was inferred 
from its IR spectrum.
The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence 
of an isopropyl group (dH 1.03, d, J 6.8 Hz, 3H-16; dH 1.05, 
d, J 6.8 Hz, 3H-17; dH 2.62, sep, J 6.8 Hz, H-15), a methyl 
group at dH 1.01 (3H, s, 3H-20) attached to quaternary 
carbon, two oxygenated methine hydrogens at dH 3.66 (dd, 
J 2.5 and 1.9 Hz, H-11) and dH 4.40 (brs, H-12), compatible 
with the presence of an epoxy ring, two deshielded hydrogen 
from a oxygenated methylene group at dH 4.72 (brdd, J 17.2 
and 1.6 Hz, H-19α) and dH 4.68 (brdd, J 17.2 and 1.6 Hz, 
H-19β), and an olefinic hydrogen at dH 5.24 (brd, J 5.0 Hz, 
H-14).
Analysis of BB and DEPT 135° 13C NMR spectra 
(Table 1) revealed 20 lines, in accordance with the 
molecular formula C20H26O4. From these data it is possible 
to deduce the presence of the six non-protonated carbons: 
one carbonyl group (dC 173.9), three sp2 carbons, one 
oxygenated sp3 carbon and one non-oxygenated sp3 
carbon. Additionally, it was observed six methine carbons, 
including two sp3 oxygenated at dC 66.6 and 59.7 and 
one sp2 at dC 121.8; five methylene carbons, one of them 
oxygenated at dC 70.4, and three methyl carbons. 
The aforementioned data were coherent with a non 
aromatic abietane-type diterpene that displays an epoxy 
ring, a tertiary hydroxyl group, an α,β-unsaturated-
γ-lactone system and two double bonds, having some 
similarities with the diterpene triptolide.12 
The location of these functions in the abietane skeleton 
was deduced through additional HMBC analysis (Table 1), 
which revealed the following long-range correlations: the 
epoxy hydrogens at dH 3.66 (H-11) with C-13 (dC 140.1, 
3J) and at dH 4.4 (H-12) with C-13 (dC 140.1, 2J) and 
C-14 (dC 121.8, 3J); the isopropyl hydrogen at dH 2.62 
(H-15,) with C-13 (dC 140.1, 2J) and C-12 (dC 66.6, 3J); 
the olefin hydrogen at dH 5.24 with C-12 (dC 66.6, 3J), 
C-13 (dC 140.1, 2J) and C-15 (dC 28.6, 3J). The position 
of the hydroxyl group at C-9 was established based in the 
correlations of this oxymethine carbon (dC 67.9) with the 
hydrogen of the methyl group (3H-20, dH 1.01, 3J), which

is generally present in abietane-type diterpenoids.13 Finally, 
the butenolide ring involving the carbons C-3, C-4, C-18 
and C-19 was located by the correlations of the methylene 
hydrogens at dH 4.72 and 4.68 (2H-19) with C-4 (dC 162.0, 
2J), C-3 (dC 125.3, 3J) and C-18 (dC 173.9, 3J).
The relative configuration of 1 (Figure 3) was assigned 
by the analysis of the 1H-1H-NOESY spectrum. The 
β-orientation of the epoxy function (11,12β-epoxide) was 
determined by the dipolar interactions of the hydrogen at 
dH 3.66 (H-11) with 2H-1 (dH 1.77 and 1.36). In addition, 
the methyl signal at dH 1.01 (3H-20) exhibited cross-peaks 
with the hydrogens at dH 2.86 (H-8), dH 2.20 (H-2β) and 
dH 1.62 (H-6β). The hydrogen at dH 2.51 (H-5) showed 
dipolar interaction with the hydrogens at dH 1.77 (H-1α), 
1.67 (H-6α) and 1.07 (H-7α). Based on these correlations, 
the hydroxyl group at C-9 was established at α position 
(Figure 3). Therefore, all these data allowed to establish 
the structure of 1 as (5S*,8S*,9R*,10S*)-11β,12β-epoxy-
9α-hydroxy-19(4→3)abeo-abieta-3,13-diene-19,18-olide.
Compound 2 was obtained as colorless crystal and its 
molecular formula C20H34O2 was deduced by EIMS ([M]+, 
m/z 306) and 1H and 13C NMR analysis. Its IR spectrum 
showed hydroxyl absorption at ν
max
 3311 cm-1. All spectral 
data were in accordance with the structure of the stemodin 
(2), a stemodane-type diterpene previously isolated from 
Stemodia species.6,8

Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were obtained from a Mettler FP82HT 
apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded 
using a Perkin Elmer 1000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. 
Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin Elmer 341 
polarimeter. High resolution electrospray ionization mass 
spectra (ESI-MS/MS), in positive mode, was performed 
on a QTOF Micromass spectrometer (QqTOF, Micromass-
UK). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 
Avance DRX-500 (500 MHz for 1H and 125 MHz for 13C); 
chemical shifts are given in ppm relative to residual CHCl3 
(7.27 and 77.23 ppm). Silica Gel 60 (Merck, 230-400 mesh) 
was used for analytical TLC. Silica gel 60 (Merck, 
60 F254, 0.2 mm) was used for column chromatography. 
All compounds were visualized on TLC by spraying with 
vanillin/perchloric acid/EtOH followed by heating.
Plant material
S. maritima was collected during the flowering stage 
in September 2006 along the Flexeiras Beach, Ceara Cost, 
Northeast of Brazil. The plant was identified by Dr. F. S. 
Cavalcanti and Prof. E. P. Nunes from the Herbário Prisco 
Bezerra (EAC), Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, 
Brazil, where a voucher specimen (# 38483) is deposited.
Extraction and isolation
The fresh stems (200.0 g) of S. maritima were 
exhaustively extracted with ethanol, at room temperature, 
to obtain a crude material, composed by a precipitate, 
which was recrystalized from methanol to give D-mannitol14 
(80.0 mg, 0.04%).
The aqueous extract obtained after the essential oil 
extraction (hydrodistillation) of the fresh stems of S. 
maritima was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 
hexane/MeOH (3:7). The hexane fraction (340.0 g) 
was submitted to column chromatography on silica gel 
column, using a gradient solvent system of hexane and 
CH2Cl2. Chromatography of the subfraction hexane 
(380.0 mg) using hexane/EtOAc mixtures with increasing 
polarity yielded betulinic acid15 (8.5 mg, 0.0025%). 
Successive flash chromatography of CH2Cl2 subfraction 
(2.0 g) using 0-100% CH2Cl2/EtOAc provided a mixture 
of 3β-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-sitosterol and 3β-O-β-D-
glucopyranosylstigmasterol16 (8.2 mg, 0.0024%).
After extraction of the essential oils from the leaves of 
S. maritime by hydrodistillation, the aqueous extract was 
subjected to liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate. The 
organic fraction (4.0 g) was chromatographed over silica gel 
with CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH to afford three subfractions 
F1-F3. Successive flash column chromatography of F1 
(1.2 g), previously eluted from CHCl3, yielded 2 (45.3 mg, 
1.13%) after elution with CHCl3/hexane 7:3. From these 
same column, fraction CHCl3/hexane 9:1 (180.0 mg) was 
also obtained and rechromatographed over silica gel using 
the same eluent system to afforded 5,7,4’-trihydroxy-3,8,3’-
trimethoxyflavone17 (6.5 mg, 0.0019%) and 1 (15.6 mg, 
0.39%).

The structures of known compounds were established 
by 1D 1H and 13C ({1H} and DEPT) and 2D 1H-1H-COSY, 
HSQC and HMBC NMR spectral data (Table 2) and by 
comparison of their spectroscopy data with those reported 
in the literature.6
Acetylation of 2
To a solution of compound 2 (24.0 mg) in pyridine 
(0.5 mL) were added Ac2O (1.0 mL) and catalytic amount 
of DMAP. The mixture was stirred for 5 h at room 
temperature. Subsequent workup afforded a residue that 
was chromatographed using hexane/CHCl3 (1:1), hexane/
CHCl3 (1:3) as eluent to yield compound 2a8 (12.0 mg, 
50.0%) as a colorless solid.
