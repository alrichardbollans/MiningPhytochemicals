Induction of stress metabolites in the suspension cultured cells of
eglant (Solanum melongena L.) was exmine. When autoclaved
RNase A or nigeran, both of which are nonspecific phytoalexin elicitors
in bean cells, were added to the cell culture of eggplant, greatly enhanced
levels of three compounds were observed. One ofthem was cis-pentadeca-
6-ene-1,3-diyne-5,15-diol, a novel diacetylenic compound. This compound
has considerable futoxic activity. Also identified was falindiol,
another fungitoxic diacetylenic compound previously reported as one of
the phytoalexins in infected tomato fruits and leaves. Elicited compounds
preferentially accumulated in the culture medium rather than in the cells
and deceased to oinal levels during prolonged culturing. The elicitation
of these compounds was closely correlated with cellular damage in terms
of the decrease of growth rate and was inhibited by 10 micromolar
cycloheximide.
Production oflow-mol antimicrobial stress metabolites knowvn
as phytoalexins is a well documented response of plants to
infection by microorganisms. Despite the chemical diversity of
phytoalexins in the plant kingdom, a general similarity ofchem-
ical types within a family has been observed. Plants of the
Leguminosae, Solanaceae, Compositae, and Convolvulaceae
produce predominantly isoflavonoids, carbocyclic-sesquiterpen-
oids, polyacetylenes, and furanosesquiterpenoids, respectively, as
characteristic phytoalexins (14). Formation of isoflavonoid-re-
lated phytoalexins in leguminous plants and in suspension cul-
tured cells can be stimulated by treatment with various elicitors.
The combination of cultured cells and abiotic elicitors, such as
autoclaved RNase A, has been shown to be a suitable experi-
mental system for investigating the mechanism of induction of
phytoalexin formation in leguminous plants (7, 8).
In the case of solanaceous plants, only biotic elicitation of
phytoalexins in suspension cultured cells of potato has been
examined. Brindle et al. (4) reported the accumulation of ses-
quiterpenoid phytoalexins, rishitin, lubimin, and solavetivone,
upon inoculation with the fungal pathogen Phytophthora infes-
tans. However, subsequent studies by Zacharius and Kalan (22)
failed to report such compounds in potato cells responding to
infection with the same fungus or fungal elicitors. Sesquiterpen-
oid phytoalexins have also been reported from infected fruits of
eggplant (19, 21).
In addition to the sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins, diacetylenic
compounds have been found in tomato fruits and leaves infected
with fungi (6). It has not been clearly established whether diace-
tylenic compounds are phytoalexins common to solanaceous
plants. Thus, it is worthwhile examining whether cultured cells
Wakayamadai, Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun,
of solanaceous plants other than potato produce sesquiterpenoid
and/or diacetylenic phytoalexins upon interaction with biotic
and/or abiotic elicitors. It is also important to know whether the
induction ofthe two different types ofphytoalexins are regulated
in the same manner.
In this paper, we describe the production of diacetylenic com-
pounds in cultured cells of eggplant upon treatment with abiotic
elicitor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. Bovine pancreatic RNase A (Type II-A) was pur-
chased from Sigma. Nigeran was a product ofCalbiochem Corp.
Cycloheximide was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.
Cell Cultures. Callus ofeggplant (Solanum melongena L.) was
induced from the young stem on the Murashige-Skoog agar
medium (16) containing 3% sucrose, 1 mg/L of 2,4-D and 0.1
mg/L of kinetin in 1981. The callus was transferred into liquid
Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1
mg/L 2,4-D, and the resulting cell suspension was subcultured
every 2 weeks for about 5 years. The cells were grown in 500-ml
Sakaguchi flasks containing 100 ml of the culture medium and
incubated on a reciprocal shaker (1 10 strokes/min) illuminated
continuously (30 ,E/m2. s) from the bottom ofthe flask at 25°C.
Cell growth was determined by measuring the cell dry weight as
previously reported (18).
Treatment with Elicitors and Analysis of Metabolites by GC.
RNase A and nigeran suspended in distilled water were auto-
claved at 120°C for 15 min. Immediately after suspension cells
in the stationary phase (10 ml) were inoculated into fresh me-
dium (100 ml), 5 ml of elicitor solutions were added to the
culture flasks to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ml of RNase
A or 0.2 mg/ml of nigeran. In a control experiment, 5 ml of
autoclaved distilled water was added to the culture instead of the
elicitor solutions. After 3 d of incubation, the cells and medium
were separated by filtration. The cells obtained from one flask
were extracted three times with 20 ml of methanol. The aqueous
residue obtained by evaporation of methanol under reduced
pressure was extracted three times with 20 ml of diethyl ether.
Water was removed from the ether extract with anhydrous
sodium sulfate, and the extract was then evaporated to dryness.
The residue was dissolved in 0.3 ml of ethyl acetate, and an
aliquot of the solution was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The
culture medium was extracted directly with diethyl ether, and
the ether extract was analyzed in the same way as the cell extracts.
GC was performed on a Hitachi model 163 Gas Chromato-
graph fitted with a 5 mm (i.d.) x 1 m glass column packed with
3% OV-1 on Gas-Chrom Q (80-100 mesh, Shimadzu) with N2
as carrier gas at a flow rate of 60 ml/min, and a flame ionization
detector. Column temperature was elevated from 100 to 250°C
at a rate of 5°C/min. GC-MS was performed on a Hitachi M-80
mass spectrometer under fundamentally the same GC condi-

tions, except that He was used as the carmer gas.
Isolation and Determination of Stress Compounds. Three com-
pounds which were proved to increase in the medium upon the
treatment with elicitors were designated Sol-l, Sol-2, and Sol-3
in the order of elution time on GC and isolated as follows. The
extract (40 mg) obtained from 2 L of the elicitor-treated culture
medium was applied to a silica gel column (Kiesel gel 60, 230-
400 mesh, Merck) and eluted step-wise with increasing concen-
trations of methanol in chloroform from zero to 5%, monitoring
by TLC and GC. Fractions containing Sol-l, -2, -3 were com-
bined separately, and each compound was further purified by
HPLC on a reversed phase column (Partisil 10 ODS-II, 8 mm
(i.d.) x 50 cm, Sumitomo Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) eluted with
methanol:water (4:1 v/v), and monitored by absorbance at 205
nm. UV spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2 1OA spec-
trophotometer. Infrred spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 7000
FT-IR. Proton and carbon NMR spectra were recorded on a
Nicolet Model NT-360 spectrometer and on a JEOL FX-100 (25
MHz) spectrometer, respectively. High resolution mass spectra
(HI-MS) were obtained on a JEOL JMS 01SG-2 mass spectrom-
eter. Chemical ionization mass spectra (CI-MS) were obtained
with a Hitachi M-80 mass spectrometer using isobutane as the
reactant gas (70 eV).
Bioassay of Fungitoxicity of Sol-1. Fungitoxicity of Sol-l was
determined by inhibition of spore germination and/or subse-
quent mycelial growth of Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey.
The absolute concentration ofthe Sol-l solution was determined
from its absorbance at X.. 241 nm using the molar extinction
coefficient of cis-tetradeca-6-ene-1,3-diyne-5,8-diol (e = 400),
which has a very similar structural environment around the
conjugated acetylenic group to that of Sol-l (6).
Fungal cultures were maintained at 25°C on slants of potato
dextrose agar. The conidial suspension was obtained by washing
the surface of sporulating colonies with sterile distilled water.
Twenty gl of this suspension was pipetted onto sterile plastic
dishes, Cell Wells (well diameter 6.4 mm, Corning, NY), filled
with 100 Ml of the culture medium described previously (6). The
methanol solution of purified Sol-l was added to each well to
give a series of concentrations (0-27 Mg/ml). Methanol added to
the media at the same concentration used did not inhibit fungal
growth. These dishes were incubated for a week in a box with
moist filter paper at 25°C in the dark. The growth of fungus was
assessed on the basis of the dry weight of the contents in the
wells.
Quantitative Determination of Diacetylenic Compounds. The
amounts of Sol-l, -2, and -3 accumulated in the cells and culture
medium were quantitatively determined. Five ml of culture were
harvested at 3 and 6 d after the addition of RNase A (1 mg/ml
ofmedium), and the cells and medium were separately extracted
as follows. The cells were extracted two times with 2 ml of
methanol, and the aqueous residue obtained by evaporation of
the solvent was extracted two times with 2 ml of diethyl ether.
The medium was directly extracted two times with 2 ml of
diethyl ether. After replacement of the solvent with 0.2 ml of
methanol, these extracts were analyzed by HPLC on a reversed
phase column (YMC-A 312,6 mm [i.d.] x 150 mm, Yamamura
Chemical Laboratories Co., Ltd., Kyoto). The elution was carried
out with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water 40 to 90% at a
flow rate of 1 ml/min, monitoring by absorbance at 205 nm.
In other experiments to determine the pattern ofaccumulation
of diacetylenic compounds (a time course during the culture
period, a dependency on elicitor concentration, and an inhibition
by cycloheximide), the amount of Sol-l in the culture medium
was determined selectively. The extracts from samples (1.5-5
ml) of culture medium were prepared and analyzed in the same
manner as described above except that 50% acetonitrile in water
was employed as eluting solvent for HPLC analysis. The absolute
amount of Sol-l was determined by comparing the peak height
with that of standard sample whose concentration was derived
from its absorbance at 241 nm and a known e value ofthe related
compound as mentioned above.
Time Course of Sol-l Accumulation. The cells in the stationary
phase were inoculated into the fresh medium (100 ml) containing
RNase A or nigeran at a concentration of 1 mg/ml or 0.2 mg/
ml, respectively. Instead of these reagents, distilled water was
added in a control culture. During culturing for 2 weeks, portions
of culture were harvested at appropriate times, and cellular dry
weight and Sol-l content in the medium were determined.
Relationship between the Concentration of RNase A and Sol-
1 Accumulation. Cells in the stationary phase were transferred
into 5 ml of fresh medium containing various concentrations of
RNase A (0-10 mg/ml of medium) to give dry cell content of
1.1 mg/ml and incubated in test tubes (10 ml) on an angled
rotator (60 rpm). After 3 d, the cell dry weight and Sol-l content
in the culture medium were determined.
Effect of Cycloheximide on Sol-i Accumulation. Effects of
various concentrations of cycloheximide on Sol-l accumulation
and cell viability were determined using the cells which were
growing exponentially at d 4. Cell suspensions (3.6 ml) were
delivered into test tubes to which were added 0.4 ml of RNase
A and 40 Ml of cycloheximide to give final concentrations of 3
mg/ml and a series of concentrations 0 to 100 AM, respectively.
Cycloheximide solutions were sterilized by filtration (Millex-GS,
0.22 Mm pore size, Millipore Corp.). After incubation of these
cells on an angled rotator for 24 h, cell dry weight, Sol-l content
in culture media and cell viability were measured. In a separate
experiment, where the cells were incubated in the presence of 10
AM cycloheximide, the time courses of these parameters were
examined by analyzing samples of the culture at 0, 3, 6, and 9 h
after treatment.
Cell viability was assessed by measuring the ability of viable
cells to reduce 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) follow-
ing the method of Towill and Mazur (20). The cells from 1 ml
of the culture were collected by centrifugation, washed with 50
mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and resuspended in 2 ml
of the same buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) 2,3,5-triphenyltetra-
zolium chloride. After standing for 1 h in the dark at 25°C, the
cells were pelleted and washed once with distilled water. For-
mazan formed in the cells was extracted three times with 2 ml
of ethanol. The absorbance at 485 nm of combined ethanol
extracts was measured.
RESULTS
When the suspension cells of eggplant were treated with ni-
geran, a fungal wall glucan, a considerable change was observed
in the GC pattern of the ether extract of the culture medium
compared to that of the control culture (Fig. 1). Three peaks
which eluted between 16 and 22 min were markedly enhanced.
These compounds were designated Sol-l, Sol-2, and Sol-3, in the
order of elution. A similar change was also observed in the
extract of the culture medium when autoclaved RNase A was
used as an elicitor. By contrast, other compounds were not
noticeably increased in cell extracts upon treatment with these
elicitors. These responses of the cells to the elicitors were very
reproducible.
Approximately 1 mg of pure Sol-l, 0.2 mg of Sol-2, and a
lesser amount of Sol-3 were isolated from 2 L of the elicitor-
treated culture medium by chromatography on a silica gel col-
umn followed by purification on HPLC using a reversed phase
column. Spectrl data of Sol-l and Sol-2 are as follows:

On the basis of these spectal data, the structure of Sol-I was
elucidated to be cis-pentadeca-6-ene-1,3-diyne-5,15-diol, a novel
diacetylenic compound (Fig. 2). Sol-2 was identified as cis-
heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol, falcarindiol. Falcarindiol
has been isolated from healthy tissue ofFalcaria vulgaris (3) and
Daucus carota (1), and it was subsequently characterized as one
of the phytoalexins in tomato (6). Sol-3 was considered to be a
hydroxy derivative of Sol-2 on the basis of its MS and 'H-NMR
spectrum (data not shown). However, its structure has not been
confirmed because of the small quantity of material obtained.
Sesquiterpenoids, such as lubimin, which have been docu-
mented in infected fiuits of eggplant (19, 21), were examined on
GC-MS. The mass fragmentation pattern of the GC peaks in
both the cell extracts and medium extracts were compared with
those of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins of eggplant. No peaks in
the treated or untreated culture gave the pattern characteristic of
such compounds.
The fungitoxicity of Sol-l, a novel compound with a structure
similar to that of the antifungal compound falcarindiol (6, 10,
13), was assayed by examining the development of hyphae from
conidia of M. fructicola in the presence of Sol-l. The ED5o of
Sol-l was estimated to be about 1.5 ,ug/ml (Fig. 3). Conidial
germination and/or germ tube elongation were completely in-
hibited by Sol-l at a concentration of 27 jg/ml.
Table I shows the ratio of distribution of the diacetylenic
compounds, Sol-1, -2, and -3, between the culture medium and
cells. All of these compounds were found predominantly in the
culture medium. The ratio of distribution of Sol-l was constant
regardless ofthe total amount present. In the absence of elicitors,
these compounds were either present in trace quantities or were
undetected both in the medium and cells. These data suggested
that amount of Sol-1 in the medium represents the extent of
induction of diacetylenic compounds in the cultured cells of
eggplant.
The time course of the cellular growth on a dry weight basis
and Sol- I content in the medium during culturing in the presence
of elicitors is shown in Figure 4. The elicitors, nigeran, or
autoclaved RNase A, were separately added to the culture at the
same time as inoculation of the cells into fresh medium. After
addition of RNase A, the Sol-1 level increased and reached a
maximum value on d 5. The maximum level of Sol-l content
was 3 Ag/ml of medium, which was 30-fold greater than that of
the control. However, Sol-l was apparently metabolized by the
cells, since its amount decreased gradually after d 7 to nearly
zero. This was confirmed by the following separate experiments.

gation at 5 d after RNase A addition, the amount of Sol-l
remained unchanged during incubation for another week (data
not shown). In addition, Sol-l exogenously supplied to the cells
at d 7 (5 mg dry cell/ml) at a concentration of 1 ,g/ml, disap-
peared within 1 d. These results indicated that the diacetylenic
compounds biosynthesized by suspension cells in response to
elicitation were metabolized by the cells during prolonged incu-
bation.
The pattern for Sol-I accumulation in response to nigeran was
different from that induced by RNase A. The maximum amount
of Sol-I observed was 1.1 g/ml of medium on d 3. It should be
noted that a slight increase in the Sol-1 level was observed on d
1 even in the control without elicitor. This indicates that transfer
ofthe cells into fresh medium may also be a factor which induces
the formation of diacetylenic compounds. The changes in Sol-2
and -3 content were almost parallel to that in Sol-1.
Treatment ofsuspension cells with elicitors affected the growth
ofthe cells. RNase A reduced the maximum growth rate to about
50% of the control. However, by 11 d, dry matter accumulation
was similar between control and RNase A-treated cells. In the
case of nigeran addition, the growth rate from d 1 to d 3 was
slower than that of the control.
The relationship between accumulation of diacetylenic com-
pounds and cellular growth in response to elicitor was also
revealed by the following experiment where a dependency of Sol-
1 accumulation on the concentration ofRNase A was examined.
When suspension cells were treated with increasing amounts of
RNase A, accumulation of Sol-l during 3 d incubation was
stimulated depending on the concentration of RNase A up to 2
mg/ml to attain to a maximum (Fig. 5). The cellular growth
based on dry weight was suppressed by the increases in the
elicitor concentration up to 2 mg/ml. These results indicated
that formation of diacetylenic compounds may be accompanied
by cellular damage exhibited by the suppression of growth rate.
However, higher than 2 mg/ml of RNase A decreased rather
than increased Sol-l accumulation, probably due to extreme
damage for the cells.
It was shown that de novo protein synthesis is essential for the
elicitation of diacetylenic compounds from the following exper-
iments with cycloheximide. Table II shows the effect of various
concentrations of cycloheximide on Sol-1 accumulation during

respectively. The cell suspension before and after the addition ofreagents
and subsequent incubation for 24 h were harvested and analyzed for Sol-

a 24-h incubation with RNase A. At the same time, the cell
viability assessed by measuring the ability of the cells to reduce
TTC was examined in order to determine whether the decrease
of Sol-1 accumulation by the inhibitor was due to death of cells.
Incubation of the cells without cycloheximide resulted in the
increase in cell viability and cell dry weight, compared with the
values before incubation. Addition of cycloheximide at concen-
trations of 0.1 or 1 gM did not affect these increases, and the
cells were still able to produce a large quantity of Sol-I during
incubation with RNase A. At 10 Mm cycloheximide the growth
and viability of the cells remained at the same level before
incubation, and the formation of Sol-l was simultaneously in-
hibited.
This was also examined by following Sol-l accumulation
during the first 9 h of incubation with RNase A (Fig. 6). In the
presence of 10 Mm cycloheximide, the celular viability was not
decreased for 9 h. However, Sol-i accumulation, which started
within 6 h after treatment, was completely inhibited. These
results clearly demonstrate that induction of diacetylenic com-
pounds in suspension cells ofeggplant requires de novo synthesis
of some proteins.

Autoclaved RNase A and nigeran are known to be potent
elicitors of isoflavonoid phytoalexins and the related enzymes in

FIG. 6. Inhibition of the induction of Sol-l accumulation by the
addition of cycloheximide. The cells at d 4 (2.0 mg/ml) were treated
with 3 mg/ml of RNase A in the presence of 10 AM of cycloheximide
(open symbols) or without the inhibitor (solid symbols). During incuba-
tion, portions of these culture were taken out at every 3 h and analyzed
for Sol-l content in the medium (0, 0) and cell viability based on the
ability to reduce TTC (A, A). Each point is the mean of three samples
with standard error.
leguminous plants (7, 9). We demonstrated that these elicitors
could also induce the formation of antifungal diacetylenic com-
pounds such as Sol- and falcarindiol in the cultured cells of
eggplant. These elicitors are considered to lack specificity with
regard to plant species and chemical types of phytoalexins in-
duced. This is consistent with the existing concept that such
elicitors induce a persistent, low level stress or injury, whereas
the actual direct elicitors of phytoalexins are endogenous and
nonphytotoxic metabolites (14).
Falcarindiol (Sol-2) has been reported to accumulate in tomato
fruits and leaves inoculated with Cladosporium fulvum together
with rishitin, a typical sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin in solana-
ceous plants (6). In addition, two other diacetylenic compounds,
falcarinol and cis-tetradeca-6-ene-1,3-diyne-5,8-diol, have also
been isolated as phytoalexins (6). All of these diacetylenic com-
pounds including Sol-l have closely related structures, namely,
conjugated triple bonds and hydroxyl groups allylic to a double
bond. We suspect that such diacetylenic compounds are phyto-
alexins common to plants of the Solanaceae and that intact
eggplant may produce Sol-l, -2, and -3 in response to physiolog-
ical stresses or infection by microorganisms. If this is the case,
this would be the first example of the isolation of phytoalexins
from cultured cells prior to their detection in the mother plant.
The characteristics of the accumulation pattern of the dia-
cetylenic compounds in suspension cultured cells of eggplant are:
(a) A large portion of these compounds was released from the
cells and accumulated in the culture medium. Similar phenom-
ena have been observed for cyclic sesquiterpenoid and furano-
sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins produced by cultured cells of po-
tato and sweet potato, respectively (4, 17). This is consistent with
the general concept that phytoalexins move into the necrotic
tissue from the sites of synthesis in surrounding healthy cell
layers. (b) Once accumulated in the medium, the products were
metabolized by the cells to as yet undetected compounds. In the
absence of the cells, Sol- remained unchanged in the medium.
Such metabolism of phytoalexins by cultured cells has been
reported for phaseollin in Phaseolus vulgaris (12), 6-methoxy-
mellein in carrot (1 5), and dianthalexin in Dianthus caryophyllus
( 11). We propose that phytoalexins, including diacetylenic com-
pounds in eggplant cells, generally are not end products of plant
metabolism and that high levels of accumulation do not persist
when the cells are alive. Phytoalexins seem to exhibit a different
accumulation pattern than that usually observed for secondary
metabolites such as phenolic compounds, which often accumu-
late in cellular vacuoles of old cells.
It has been clearly shown in suspension cultured cells of P.
vulgaris that the synthesis of messenger RNAs encoding the
enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolism involved in the pro-
duction of phaseollin were induced by a fungal elicitor (5). This
indicates that in leguminous plants specific changes in gene
expression may occur during the early stages of phytoalexin
formation. In the case of cell cultures of eggplant, the involve-
ment of de novo protein synthesis is based upon the experiments
using cycloheximide.
Although Bohlmann et al. (2) proposed that falcarindiol is
biosynthesized from oleic acid via crepenynic acid and its decar-
boxylated intermediate, this metabolic pathway remains obscure
and none of the enzymes involved in this pathway has been
identified. Thus, the biosynthetic pathway of diacetylenic stress
metabolites and the key enzyme involved must be determined
in order to elucidate whether this group of compounds is induced
in a manner similar to that of isoflavonoid phytoalexins. The
cell suspension culture of eggplant is a convenient and promising
experimental system for studying the mechanism of elicitation
of diacetylenic phytoalexins in solanaceous plants.
Failure to induce sesquiterpenoid stress metabolites in our
experiment strongly suggests that production of sesquiterpenoids
and diacetylenic compounds are regulated differently. In general,
formation of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins in the Solanaceae
requires the interaction of the plant with biotic elicitors, such as
pathogenic fungi or their components. Kuc (14) suggested that
the induction of sesquiterpenoid compounds in solanaceous
plants is under tighter metabolic regulation than that of theisoflavonoid-related phytoalexins in the Leguminosae, which are
induced by interaction with a wide variety of biotic and abiotic
elicitors. Induction of diacetylenic stress metabolites is similar to
induction of isoflavonoid phytoalexins in that abiotic agents may
induce both.
