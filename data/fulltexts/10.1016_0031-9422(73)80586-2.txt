Abstract-Ftve further alkaloids, des-N’.-methylanhydromacralstonine, quebrachidine, vinervinine, pleio- 
carpamme, and 2,7-dihydropleiocarpamme, have been isolated from Alstoma muelleriana bark. Phyto- 
chemical problems in the genus Alsroniu are considered, especially with reference to the ‘macrolme-derived 
indole and bls-mdole alkalotds. 
INTRODUCTION 
THE AERIAL bark of the Australian tree Alstoniu muelleriana Domin. (Apocynaceae) has been 
shown by Elderfield and Gilmar? to contain a complex mixture of indole alkaloids. The

four major components of the mixture, which they isolated, are villalstonine (I),334 al- 
stonerine (II),5 alstonisine (III),‘j and alstonisidine (IV). 7,8 Macralstonine (V)’ has also been 
obtained.‘O The common structural element in all these alkaloids is represented by the 
base macroline (VI), which was prepared by Schmid et al. during the degradation of 
villalstonine (I).4 Although macroline has not itself been isolated as a natural product, its 
functional groups suggest that the Alstoniu bisindole alkaloids’ I could arise biogenetlcally 
by acid-catalyzed Michael or vinylogous Michael-type reactions between macroline (or 
some very closely-related ‘equivalent’) and the other ‘monomeric’ species involved. This 
concept has been strikingly endorsed by recent syntheses of alstonisidine (IV)‘*13 and 
villalstonine (1)‘2+‘3 from macroline and, respectively, quebrachldine (VII) and pleiocarpa- 
mine (VIII). In these syntheses the stereochemical features of the new-rings and asymmetric 
centres are shown to arlse purely by asymmetric induction from the chiral precursors in 
the acidic reaction media. 
In considering such bisindole alkaloids phytochemically, one must therefore consider first 
the monomeric species as structural types, and their biogenetic inter-relationships, and 
secondly the combination reactions between monomeric alkaloids to give bisindoles. These 
questions, and those pertaining to the natural macroline unit, give special importance to the 
minor alkaloids of AZstonia species. We now report our extraction procedure, discuss five 
further alkaloidal constituents, and consider phytochemical implications of the results. 
RESULTS 
The alkaloidal fraction contained -85% villalstonine, which was partially removed by 
chromatography on overloaded alumina. The minor alkaloids were then obtained by

column and preparative TLC of the remaining material. They are taken in order of in- 
creasing polarity in TLC. 
In the least polar fraction were found alstonisine (III), alstonerine (IV), macralstonine 
(V), and a group of new alkaloids present in very small amounts. Work on the most abund- 
ant of these is now described, and structure (IX), des-N’,-methylanhydromacralstonine, is 
assigned to it. The alkaloid, m.p. 240-F (d), [a.]n +10*2”, has molecular formula 
C&H4sN404 from high resolution MS. (M+ at m/e 672.367. C42H48N404 requires : 672.368).

The UV spectrum is in accord with the presence of indole and substituted methoxy-indole 
nuclei, and the IR spectrum (v,,,, 3450 (broad), 1650, 1615 cm-‘] suggests the presence of 
-OH or -NH and acetyl enol ether groups. The enol ether proton gives an NMR singlet at 
67.63, and the 1,4-relationship of two of the six aromatic protons is the same as in macral- 
stonine (V). One indolic -NMe (63.58) and two aliphatic -NMe groups (62.25, 2.21) are 
present, and the enol ether acetyl methyl signal is seen at 62.15. The signal at highest field 
(3H, s, 81.41) arises from the allylic -Me group of (IX). 
The MS closely resembles that of anhydromacralalstonine (X) and unequivocally sup- 
ports structure (IX). A pair of peaks at m/e 307.180 (C&H,,N,O requires: 307.181) and 
308.189 (C,,H,,N,O requires: 308.189) arises from the unmethoxylated macroline part of 
the molecule, as in macralstonine (V).” The rest of the molecule is represented by a fragment 
at m/e 365-l 86 (C,,Hz5N,0, requires : 365-l 87) which must have structure (XI). This ion is 
analogous to the ion (XII) in the MS of macralstonine. The base peak in the spectrum is at 
m/e 197.109 (C,,H,,N,‘requires: 197.108) and represents the well-known ion (XIII).

Schmid et aLg observed in the MS of macralstonine (V) and anhydromacralstonine (W a 
peak at m/e 486, whose accurate mass corresponded to the formula C30H36N303. They 
suggested a less likely alternative structure (XIV) for macralstonine on the basis of a possible 
structure (XV) for this fragment. The MS of our alkaloid contains a peak at m/e 472.262 
(C2gH34N303 requires: 472.260) which seems analogous. No fragment at m/e 486 is seen. 
This suggests that these fragments contain both indolic nitrogen atoms, which would 
rule out structure (XV) for the m/e 486 fragment from macralstonine, and thus S&mid’s 
1470 D. E. BURKE et al. 
less favoured structure (XIV) for macralstonine itself. Chromatographic data suggest 
that the trace alkaloids accompanying this compound in the fractions may have related 
structures, Work on them will be reported later.

The main alkaloid of the next more polar fraction was alstonisidine (IV). This was 
accompanied by very small amounts of an alkaloid giving an orange colour with ceric 
sulphate spray reagent. This alkaloid was identical in chromatographic properties and MS 
with quebrachidine (VII). l4 The isolation of quebrachidme is important in conjunction 
with the occurrence in the root bark of A. constricta of the related ajmaline alkaloids 
vincamajine (XVI),15*16 0-3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoylvincamajine (XVII),16 and 0-3,4,5- 
trimethoxybenzoylquebrachldlne (XVII1),16 and of 0-benzoylvincamajme (XIX) in the 
leaves of A. macrophylla.17 It also strongly supports the idea that alstonisidine (IV) arises 
biogenetically by a reaction very similar to its in vitro synthesis.7,‘3

A further, more polar, fraction of the alkaloids on resolution by preparative TLC gave 
three compounds of interest. First, pleiocarpamine (VIII)‘* was identified by comparison

Further alkaloids of Alstonia muelleriana 1471 
is obviously the most likely immediate biogenetic precursor of villalstonine (I), as suggested 
both by degradative4 and our recent syntheticr2v13 work. 
The UV spectrum of the second alkaloid (2-methylene-indolme chromophore) and the 
high negative optical rotation immediately suggested an akuammicine (XX) or closely 
related skeleton. The NMR spectrum showed three methoxyl protons in addition to the 
three of the carbomethoxy-group; that these are from an aromatic methoxy-group was 
confirmed by the characteristic 1,2,4-pattern of the three aromatic protons (see below). The 
MS (M+ at m/e 352; C2rHZ4NZ03 requires: 352) is analogous to that of sewarine (XXI), 
which has recently been analyzed in detail. ” The fine structure of the NMR 1,2,4-pattern 
mentioned above ruled out, however, a sewarine derivative, but was quite similar to that of 
vindolme (XXII).21 This suggests that the alkaloid is identical with vinervinine (XXIII), 
which has been obtained with its parent phenol vinervine (XXIV) from Vitzca erecta.22s23 
The identity was confirmed by reduction of our alkaloid with zinc dust and sulphuric acid24 
to give the 2,16-dihydroderivative, whose MS was in full accord with the llterature.22,25 
The occurrence of this Strychnos alkaloid m A. muelleriana is interesting in the light of the 
presence of N,-methyl-2,16-dihydroakuammicine m A. macrophJdla.26

Also obtained from the most polar fraction was an alkaloid having R, O-13, giving a red 
colour with ceric sulphate. This was identified as 2,7-dihydropleiocarpamine (XXV)18 by 
direct comparison with authentic material prepared from reduction of pleiocarpamine 
derived from villalstonine;4 this compound appears not to have been identified previously 
in nature.

DISCUSSION 
Despite a relatively rich body of data from alkaloidal investigations, the phytochemistry 
of the Apocynaceae is strikingly incomplete. Points made here are regarded as tentative, and 
as guidelines for further work. 
HOH,C COOMe 
K 
(XxlzI) (xxm) 
The genus Alstonia is accompanied in the tribe Alstonieae (subfamily Plumerioideae) of 
the Apocynaceae by other genera which are also important sources of indole alkaloids, e.g. 
Aspidosperma, Catharanthus, and Rhazya.27 Within Alstonia, Monachino2* made five sec- 
tional grouping of the 39 species and 12 varieties he discussed. Pichon’s approximately 
contemporaneous treatment 29 of the genus is generally in good accord with this. Sharp in 
1934 had made the first correlation 3o between alkaloidal constituents and geographical 
distribution in Alstonia species, dividing them into three groups: (1) those containing 
echitamine (XXVI), being many species from Africa, the East Indies, and Australia; (2) 
those containing villalstonine (I), a number of species from Australia and the East Indies; 
and (3), A. constricta, which contains alstonine (XXVII). The literature of Alstonia con- 
stituents”*31 accumulated since 1934 generally supports Sharp’s divisions. His first group 
corresponds well with species in Monachino’s sections Pala and Blaberopus. The section 
Monuraspermum contains all the bisindole alkaloid-bearing species so far delineated, except 
for A. constricta (Dissuraspermum), which produces a bisindole alkaloid whose structure is 
under investigation.32 
Our work so far establishes a very close relationship between A. muelleriana and A. 
macrophylla. The former species, however, like A. constricta, produces ajmaline alkaloids 
as well as the sarpagine-related macroline group. Much more will need to be known about 
the minor constituents of other species before a definitive picture of relationships at the 
infrasectional level can emerge. The structural relationships of the alkaloids-all ‘Class I’ 
compounds in Schmid’s recent classification33-will be valuable here.

Further alkaloids of Alstonia muelleriana 1473 
It is interesting that several compounds characteristically regarded as Alstoniu alkaloids 
have recently been obtained from other genera. In addition to the instances cited by Saxton”” 
involving Catharanthus roseus and Rauwolfia vomitoria, it is notable that the macroline- 
related alkaloid suaveoline (XXVIII) has been isolated from Rauwolfa suaveolens,34 while 
talpinine (XXIX) and talcarpine (XXX) have been obtained from Pleiocarga talbotii.35 
Suaveoline seems not to be an artefact of isolation, 34 although the amount obtained is 
greater when ammonia is used in the extraction procedure. This suggests that perhaps a 
1,Sdioxygenated precursor such as (XxX1) may exist in the plant as well; this possibility 
has sound precedent.36 
The isolation of macroline alkaloids from genera other than Alstonia is important because 
these characteristic compounds, still of restricted occurrence, may serve as excellent markers 
in chemotaxonomic studies. A related question of prime interest is the occurrence and 
nature of biogenetic precursors of the macroline alkaloids encountered so far. Further work 
on minor constituents of macroline alkaloid-bearing plants will be needed and will relate to 
current biogenetic hypotheses. 31*33 We hope to report further results in due course. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Microanalyses were performed by Spang Microanalytlcal Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan. M.ps were 
taken in a Thomas-Hoover capillary apparatus and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded on 
Varian A-60, A-6OA, T-60, and HA-100 spectrometers AnalytIcal TLC plates used were E. Merck-Brink- 
mann or Eastman UV-active silica gel on plastic. Preparative TLC plates were E. Merck-Brinkmann 2 mm 
or 0.5 mm slhca gel on glass. Colour reactions (CR) were obtained by spraymg plates with a saturated 
solution of cerium (IV) silphate in 1: 1 (v/v) aq. H,SO,. 
Extraction ofA[stonia muelleriana Bark. The dried, ground bark (100 kg) was mixed with heptane (120 1.) 
and allowed to soak for 6 days. After the heptane had been filtered off the bark was soaked, with occasional 
warming and mixing, in MeOH (80 1.) for 5 days. The methanohc extract, which contained some Hz0 and 
heptane. was concentrated to ca. 8 1. (wt 16 kg). This extract (300 n) was dissolved in MeOH (1.2 1.) and 
0.i N H&O, (2 1.) added. The resulting dark suspension was filiered-through celite, and the filtrate b&ified 
with ammonia to pH 9 and extracted with CHCI, (3 x 1 1.). The CHC13 layer was dried (MgSO& filtered 
through celite, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a brown, friable glass (75 g). This material 
(50 g) was quickly refined by chromatography on alumina (Merck and Co.; alumina for chromatography; 
450 g) with CHCIJ. Rapid development with this solvent gave the alkaloldal constituents, mixed, as a 
colorless foam (33.5 g). Elution of the column with MeOH gave unidentified intractable polar non-alkaloidal 
material (- 6 g). 
Isolation of villalstonine (I). The mixed refined alkaloidal constituents (4.0 g) were placed on an alumina 
column (75 g, heated at 200” for 12 hr) packed in C 6 H 6. The column was eluted in 40 ml fractions with 
CdHs (600 ml); 10% CHC13-C6H6 (100 ml); 20% CHC13-C6H6 (100 ml); 30% CHC13-C6H6 (100 ml); and 
40% CHC13-CeH6 (100 ml). The fractions shown by analytical TLC (S102 gel, acetone) to contain only 
villalstonine (Nos. 3-37) were combined and solvent removed to give pure amorphous villalstonme (2.8 g) 
as a colourless foam, which crystallized from the mimmum amount of hot acetone to give material of proper- 
ties identical with those previously recorded. 2r4 Beginning with fraction 38, when the other alkaloids began 
to elute as judged by analytical TLC, the solvent was changed to pure CHC13, and the remaining alkaloids, 
together with a small amount of villalstonine, were obtained after removal of solvent as a pale tan-coloured 
foam (l-2 g). 
Separation of the minor alkaloids. Chromatography of the above material on 2.0 mm SiOz gel plates with 
acetone gave several groups of bands. These were treated as follows: Least polar compounds. The band of 
highest R, (.-@75) on the above plate was excised, and stirred with 5% MeOH-CHC13 for 8 hr at 20”. 
This mixture of alkaloids (200 mg/per plate) was rechromatographed on a 2.0 mm SIO* gel plate with 10% 
acetone-CH&l,. After several developments, optimum resolution was achieved, and the bands were excised 
and extracted as above. The following alkaloids were obtained: alstonerine (II)” (CR pale blue), alstonisine 
(III)z (CR red -+ blue) and macralstonine (V) 9*10 (CR blue + brown), of identical properties to those given

quantities near the band for this alkaloid and gave the same colour reaction. 
Compounds of mtermedutepolurity. A second group of bands in the analytical TLC of the origmal mixture 
of bases from which vdlalstonme had been removed occurred at RI = 0.45. This band was excised from the 
preparative TLC, and the alkaloids removed by stirring the adsorbent with EtOAc for several hours at 20‘. 
Rechromatography of the fraction on a 2 0 mm SIOz gel plate with acetone gave alstomsldme (IV)2 (CR 
cherry red) Rf 0.49 (150 mg from 4 g of the original complex alkaloid mixture) and very small amounts 
(2-3 mg) of quebrachldme (VII), 14s3’ (CR orange) (Rf 0 42) of ldentlcal properties to those published, and 
to authentic samples. 
More polar compounds. The most polar group of bands m the orlgmal preparative layer chromatogram 
(R, -0.25 m the analytical TLC) was Isolated by extraction wtth EtOAc (Soxhlet, 7 hr), and was re- 
chromatographed with acetone on a 2 0 mm SO2 gel plate. Three compounds were obtamed by extraction 
of the bands as above; plelocarpamme (3 mg) (VI11)‘8 (CRpmk, R, 0 29), (5 mg), ldentlfied by comparison 
with authentic material prepared from vlllalstomne (I);4 2,7-dihydroplelocarpamme (XXV)18 (CR red, R,

minute amount and an authentic sample was not at hand, the above data are fully consistent with the 
structure (XXIII).
