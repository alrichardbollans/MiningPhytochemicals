Background: Caesalpinia sappan L. extracts exhibit great therapeutic potential, and have been shown to have
analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to understand the anti-rheumatoid activity of brazilin
that was isolated from ethyl acetate extract of C. sappan L. The evaluations were conducted in mice with type-II
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
Methods: Brazilin was purified via preparative HPLC and identified by mass spectrometry and 1H/13C NMR analysis.
DBA/1J mice were divided into four groups (n = 10). Three groups of mice received intradermal injections of
inducer bovine type-II collagen (BTIIC; 2 mg/ml in 0.05 ml acetic acid) and 0.1 ml of booster complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA). A second injection of BTIIC with booster incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (ICFA) was given subsequently
after 21 days. On 22nd day, purified brazilin (10 mg/kg body weight) or the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
methotrexate (3 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally daily or every three days for 21 days,
respectively to two groups of mice. At the 42nd day, mice sera were collected, and the levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and stress enzyme markers in serum were measured using standard immunoassay methods. The microstructure
and morphometric analyses of the bones were assessed using high-resolution microfocal computed tomography.
Results: Brazilin isolated from C. sappan reduced the arthritis index score and the extent of acute inflammatory paw
edema in CIA-mice. The bone mineral density was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in only-CIA mice, and appeared to increase
commensurate with methotrexate and brazilin administration. Brazilin prevented joint destruction, surface erosion, and
enhanced bone formation as revealed by microstructural examinations. Brazilin markedly attenuated mouse CIA and
reduced the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.
Conclusions: Brazilin purified from C. sappan L. shows protective efficacy in CIA mouse, and may be useful to treat
chronic inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory
disease of the synovium, cartilage, and bone. RA causes
persistent pain, stiffness, swelling, deformities, and loss of
joint function [1,2]. Although RA is not inherited, certain
human RA susceptible genes may be triggered in response
to infection or environmental factors, establishing an* Correspondence: mdhanpro61@gmail.com

age and bone [3]. Some reports have documented the
synthesis of novel cytokines including IL-17, IL-18, and
RANK ligand in the synovium, which secretes enzymes
degrading proteoglycans and collagen, in turn causing
bone loss [4,5].

Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 2 of 11Three general classes of drugs have been recommended to
treat RA; these are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Although all of these drugs
reduce acute inflammation and pain, they do not change
the course of the disease or prevent joint destruction.
Additionally, drug side-effects include increased risks of
malignancy and gastrointestinal disturbances. These side-
effects and the high drug costs mitigate against prolonged
drug use [7].
Methotrexate (MTX) is a DMARD, and is classified
pharmacologically as an anti-folic-acid because the drug
antagonizes folic-acid metabolism [8,9]. MTX not only
reduces pain and swelling in the joints, but also its damage
and long-term disability. However, the side-effects include
liver functional abnormalities, lung disorders, stomatitis,
skin rashes, hematological diseases, and pancytopenia. In
short, MTX must be administered only with care. To
compensate for the adverse effects of MTX and other
drugs, and to devise cost-efficient RA treatment strategies,
attention has recently been diverted to the study of useful
natural compounds derived from herbal plants [10].
Several recent studies have focused on herbal extracts or
compounds that exhibit anti-arthritic effects in rats with
adjuvant-induced arthritis [11-13].
Caesalpinia sappan L. (Leguminosae) is a traditional
medicinal plant distributed in the Asian peninsula in-
cluding India, Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and China.
The dried heartwood of C. sappan L. exhibits various
pharmacological effects, including anti-hyperglycemic,
anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-inflamma
tory, and sedative activities [14-18]. The immunomodula-
tory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities of
C. sappan extracts suggest its potential role in exerting
antiarthritic effects.
In the present study, we extracted and characterized a
major component of the dried heartwood of C. sappan;
brazilin (7,11b-dihydrobenz [b] indeno [1,2-d]pyran-
3,6a,9,10(6H)-tetrol). This is a natural red pigment with
both anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities [17,19].
We explored whether brazilin purified from C. sappan
could be used to treat type-II collagen-induced arthritis
(CIA) in a mouse model of RA.
Methods
Plant materials and isolation of the compound
Dried heartwood of C. sappan L. was purchased from the
Kyungdong Local Market, Seoul, Korea in March 2012. A
voucher specimen (No. SCHB 12–015) was deposited at the
Herbarium of College of Natural Science, Soonchunhyang
University and authenticated by Dr. B.Y. Lee from National
Institute of Biological Resources, South Korea.
Air-dried and chipped C. sappan (6 kg) was extracted
with 95% (v/v) methanol for 72 h. The extract wasfiltered through a Buchner funnel fitted with Whatman
No. 1 filter paper, concentrated in a rotary evaporator
operating under reduced pressure, and subsequently di-
luted in water. This preparation was further fractionated
into hexane (3 x 1,000 ml), chloroform (3 x 1,000 ml),
ethyl acetate (3 x 1,000 ml), and butanol saturated with
water (3 x 1,000 ml) extracts. Each extract, and the
aqueous phase remaining after all extractions, was dried
under reduced pressure to yield a hexane (1.13 g), a
chloroform (7.05 g), an ethyl acetate (176.94 g), a buta-
nol (8.26 g), and a water fraction (4.35 g).
The ethyl acetate soluble fraction (170 g) was purified
by column chromatography (CC) on a Sephadex LH-20
matrix, and yielded five fractions (C-1 ~ C-5). Fraction
C-4 (7.31 g) was further separated by CC on a Sephadex
LH-20 matrix, using CHCl3: MeOH (20:1, v/v), to gener-
ate fractions C-4-1 ~ C-4-4 [19]. Fraction C-4-3 (3.54 g)
was separated via silica gel CC, using CHCl3: EtOAc
(7:3, 5:5, 3:7), to yield three fractions. Fraction C-4-3-2
(401 mg) was again purified via silica gel CC using
CHCl3: EtOAc (7:3, 5:5) to yield fractions C-4-3-2-1 and
C-4-3-2-2. The effective ingredient in fraction C-4-3-2-1
was confirmed to be brazilin.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Brazilin was purified from C. sappan extract using a pre-
parative LC-20 series HPLC system (Shimadzu Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a reverse-phase C18 column
(UG120, 5-μm particle sizes, 4.6 I.D. x 250 mm UG120,
Shiseido, Japan) with monitoring of eluate absorbance at
280 nm. The eluent system consisted of an isocratic
mode of 100% (v/v) methanol, running at a flow rate of
0.5 ml/min at a column temperature of 25°C. Fraction
with retention times of about 7.669 were amalgamated
from repeat HPLC runs.
Spectrometric identification of the compound
A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-ion trap-time
of flight (LCMS-IT-TOF) mass spectrometer (Shimadzu
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used for mass spectromet-
ric evaluation of the positive and negative ion mode masses
and to record MS/MS spectra. The detection voltage and
interface temperature were 1.60 V and 400°C respectively.
1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13C NMR
spectra were obtained with the aid of a JNM-LA 400
NMR (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 100 MHz,
using CD3OD as solvent. Chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million (ppm) downfield from those of an
internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard.
Drugs and experimental animals
Brazilin was kept in brown glass bottle and a vacuum
container. The extract was stored at 4°C until further
use. Brazilin and MTX were dissolved in a small volume
Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 3 of 11of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and its concentration was
adjusted to working concentration with 0.9% saline for
animal administration. The final concentration of DMSO
was set to 0.1%.
Arthritis was induced in 7-week-old male DBA/1J
mice (body weight 20–23 g; Central Laboratory, Animal
Inc., Seoul, Korea), and were prospectively randomized
into normal, control, and treatment groups. The animals
were acclimated under standard laboratory conditions of
22 ± 2°C ambient temperature, relative humidity of 60 ±
5% under a daily 12 h light: dark cycle. All mice had free
access to tap water and a laboratory diet [crude protein
NLT 20.5%, crude fat NLT 3.5%, crude fiber NMT 8.0%,
crude ash NMT 8.0%, Ca NLT 0.5%, and phosphorus
NLT 0.5% (all w/w)]. After 7 days of acclimatization,
mice were used in experiments. The study was
conducted with the consent of the Ethics Committee for
the use of experimental animals as authorized by the
Animal Research Center of Soonchunhyang University
(Approval number: SCH13_08_03).
Induction of CIA
DBA/1J mice were injected intradermally twice (each of
100 μg) with bovine type-II collagen (Central Lab, Seoul,
Korea) dissolved overnight at 4°C in 0.05 M acetic acid
(2 mg/ml), and subsequently emulsified in an equal vol-
ume of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) at day 0 (primary immunization),
and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (ICFA, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) at day 21 (2nd booster injection)
[20]. The animals were randomly divided into four groups
of approximately equal mean body weight (n = 10 per
group). It included normal group without immunization
or CIA, control group with saline injection after CIA, and
experimental groups with intraperitoneal injections of
anti-rheumatoid drug, methotrexate (3 mg/kg of mouse
body weight; 0.2 mL) every 3rd day and brazilin (10 mg/kg
of mouse body weight; 0.2 mL) daily from day 22 to day
42 after 2nd booster injection.
Clinical scoring of arthritis
CIA mice were evaluated by two independent observers
three-to-four times in a week, with regards to the extent
of all the inflammation, erythema, edema of the periarticu-
lar tissues, and enlargement, distortion, or ankylosis of the
joints. Each paw was scored on a scale of 0–4 (an arthritis
index), where 0 indicated inflammation; 1 edema or
erythema of one joint; 2 edema or erythema of two joints
(whether of one or two digits); 3 edema or erythema of
more than two joints (whether of one, two, or three digits);
and 4 severe arthritis of the entire paw or all digits [21].
Each total arthritis score was the sum of the scores for all
four limbs (the maximum possible score was thus 16).
Each arthritis index was derived by two independentobservers blinded to treatment mode. Paw thickness was
measured at least three-to-four times per week, to
monitor footpad swelling. The thickness of the paw was
measured using a Vernier calliper (Ozaki, Tokyo, Japan) at
least 3 times a week for footpad swelling. Each mouse was
weighed 2 times a week.
Microstructural bone examination using microfocal
computed tomography (micro-CT)
The microstructures of the distal end of the left femur,
the proximal end of the left tibia, the distal end of the
left calcaneus, and the distal end of the left second meta-
tarsal bone, were analyzed via high resolution micro-CT
(SkyScan 1172, Bruker, Antwerp, Belgium). Bone mineral
density (BMD) was determined by running metaphyseal
scans at points 3% along the length of each bone. The
slice pitch was 20 μm, and 50 slices were analyzed. The
two-dimensional images thus obtained were converted
to three-dimensional images, and bone microstructure was
evaluated. The parameters recorded were: bone volume
(in mm3) relative to tissue volume (in mm3) (expressed as a
percentage); bone surface (in mm2) relative to bone volume
(in mm3) (expressed per mm); trabecular thickness (in
mm); trabecular number (in mm−1), and fractal dimension.
Serum biochemical analysis
The serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
IL-1β, and IL-6 were measured using mouse immunoassay
kits (IL-1β: ML800C; TNF-α: MTA00B; and IL-6: M6000B;
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The levels of enzyme markers
of stress, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), and creatinine levels were measured on a
Synchron LX-20 Clinical System (Beckman Coulter Inc.,
Brea, CA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis featured one-way analysis of variance.
All experimental values are expressed as means ± stand-
ard errors. Between groups comparisons were performed
using the post-hoc Tukey test. p < 0.05 was considered
to indicate significance.
Results
Purification and characterization of brazilin
The ethyl acetate extract of C. sappan heartwood was
repeatedly extracted with CHCl3: MeOH and subjected
to Sephadex and silica gel column chromatography to
obtain a single final fraction (Figure 1), later identified to
contain brazilin which exerted anti-RA effects in the
mouse CIA model. Brazilin formed a single homogenous
peak under preparative HPLC conditions, with a reten-
tion time of 7.669 min (Figure 2A). The purity of

Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 4 of 11brazilin was determined to be above 98% according to
HPLC conditions. LCMS-IT-TOF mass spectrometry
yielded the elemental composition and molecular weight
of brazilin which had a positive ion mass of 287.0733 m/z
and a negative ion mass of 285.0584 m/z (Figure 2B).
We used 1H-NMR (Figure 3A) and 13C-NMR (Figure 3B)
to derive the chemical structure of brazilin. 1H-NMR data:

Effects of brazilin on mouse CIA
Body weight decreased significantly by day 25 in mice
that developed arthritis, regardless of whether suchanimals received brazilin or MTX (Figure 4A). No
significant difference was evident among the three
collagen-sensitized groups. Paw swelling was most se-
vere (upto 3.0 mm) in the CIA-induced control group,
at day 30. A steep increase in swelling was observed
from day 20–30 in control group; followed by a minor
decline (Figure 4B). However, marked reductions in paw
swelling was evident after intraperitoneal injection of ei-
ther MTX or brazilin, compared with the control group.
The extent of swelling was less in MTX than brazilin-
treated mice on day 42. The gross lesions in the foot of
collagen-induced control group mice (Figure 4C-ii) was
severe, but was lesser in MTX (Figure 4C-iii) and
brazilin-treated groups (Figure 4C-iv). Arthritis scores
attained their maxima by day 42 in all mouse groups
(Figure 4D), and were similar at all time-points after
sensitization, in mice administered either MTX or brazilin.
Thus, no between-group difference was found to be
significant.
The volumetric BMDs of CIA-induced mice were re-
corded (Figure 5). The BMD of the proximal part of the
left tibial metaphysis (Figure 5-i), the distal part of the

left calcaneous (Figure 5-iii), and the distal part of the left
second metatarsal bone (Figure 5-iv), were significantly
lower in the control group than in other groups (p < 0.05).
Administration of brazilin to CIA-induced mice signifi-
cantly increased the BMD of the distal part of the left
calcaneous. The decrease in BMD of the control group
was not notably affected when either MTX or brazilin
was administered. Micro-CT analysis of the tibial meta-
physis, the femoral metaphysic, and the left leg are
shown in Figure 6. The left tibial metaphysis and the
distal part of the left femur of the control group were
thin and distorted, compared with those of the normal
group. The proximal part of the left tibial metaphysisFigure 3 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of brazilin from Caesa(Figure 6A), and the distal part of the left femur (Figure 6B)
were not so affected in the brazilin and MTX groups.
Thus, administration of brazilin more effectively preserved
trabecular architecture than did MTX.
The bone volume (BV)/tissue volume (TV) ratios were
significantly lower in the control and MTX-treated mice
with CIA than in the brazilin-treated group (p < 0.05)
(Table 1). The bone surface (BS)/bone volume (BV) ratio
was higher in the control group, although the trabecular
thickness (Tb-Th) was significantly lower. The BS/BV
ratio was significantly lower in the brazilin treated group
than the normal non-CIA-induced group. The normal
Tb-Th ratio was higher than those of the MTX and
brazilin-treated groups (p < 0.05). The extent of trabecularlpinia sappan L. (A) 1H-NMR spectrum (B) 13C-NMR spectrum.

Effects of brazilin on serum cytokine and enzyme levels in
CIA mice
The serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in CIA-induced mice are shown
in Figure 7. Serum cytokine levels in the CIA-induced
control group were significantly higher than those in the
normal group on day 42. Significant reductions in the
cytokine levels were evident upon treatment with either
MTX or brazilin, compared to the control group.Although the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in serum
were not significantly different between MTX or brazilin
administered groups, we observed reduced-level of
serum cytokines in these groups when compared with
control group.
Effects of brazilin on organ weights and biochemical
parameters in CIA mice
Brazilin caused marginal weight loss in CIA-induced mice
compared to normal animals, but this was not accompan-
ied by any observable toxicity. Relative organ weight means
that the organ weight is based on proportionality. In such

Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 7 of 11cases, organ weights are normalized by body weight,
thereby permitting comparison of organs from animals
with different body weights. The liver-to-body weight ratios
of control group against normal group was 6.01 ± 0.48,
whereas MTX and brazilin administrated groups were
4.84 ± 0.62, and 6.03 ± 0.72, respectively. The kidney-to-
body-weight ratio in control group was 1.98 ± 0.11, while
MTX and brazilin were 1.63 ± 0.11 and 1.92 ± 0.13, re-
spectively. In brazilin-administered group, no significant
changes were found in liver, kidney, and spleen organ-to-
body weights (Table 2). Serum AST levels were higher in
the control group than the normal group, and brazilin
caused a marginal reduction in AST levels. Higher ALT
levels were evident in the CIA-induced control group
compared to normal group. Administration of brazilin to
CIA-induced mice caused the ALT level to be maintainedat a level greater than the control group. Mice given MTX
did not show an appreciable rise in ALT levels, compared
to brazilin-treated animals. ALP levels were also higher in
CIA-induced mice (compared to normal and control) after
treatment with either MTX or brazilin. Thus, brazilin, a
natural component of the heartwood extract of C. sappan,
effectively regulated stress levels after induction of type-II
CIA.
Discussion
C. sappan (Leguminosae) is an herb exhibiting ethnomedi-
cal properties [22]. The herb is distributed in Southeast
Asian countries, including China, India, Burma, Thailand,
Indonesia, and Vietnam. The heartwood of the plant has
traditionally been used as an analgesic [23], although
antioxidative [24], anti-inflammatory [25-27], antibacterial

Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 8 of 11[28,29], and anticonvulsive [25] activities have also been
reported. C. sappan extracts have been shown to exert an
anti-osteoporotic activity, and also anti-inflammatory ac-
tions on osteoarthritic chondrocytes and synovial macro-
phages [30,31]. The plant is a rich resource of flavonoids
[32] and phenolics including prostosappanins A-E, sap-
panchalcone, 3-deoxysappanone, 7, 3′, 4′-trihydroxy-3-
benzyl-2H-chromene, and others [33,34]. Brazilin exhibits
various biological activities including anti-hyperglycemic
[15], anti-hepatotoxic [14], and anti-inflammatory effects
[17]. Earlier reports also suggested that, in vitro, brazilin
decreased the levels of mRNAs encoding proinflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 [35]. Indeed, studies
have shown that immune cell lines, including RAW 264.7
mouse macrophages, mouse macrophage-like J774.1 cells
and THP-1 cells, produce proinflammatory cytokines,Table 1 Microstructure of cancellous bone at the distal part o

in an inflammatory environment that drives the upregula-
tion of cartilage-degrading matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), disintegrin, and metalloproteinase with throm-

brazilin obtained from an ethanolic Caesalpinia sappan
extract (CSE) inhibited the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in IL-1β-stimulated chondro-
cytes and LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages [30].
Brazilin was the principal component of the most active
fraction obtained after sequential purification of C. sappan
extracts via Sephadex and silica gel chromatography, and
yielded a near-homogenous HPLC peak. Subsequently, the
structure thereof was elucidated via MS and NMR

ol. Brazilin was earlier isolated from an ethyl acetate extract
of C. sappan using preparative HPLC with application of
100% methanol for 45 min [30], similar to our purification
method. HPLC separations of methanol and ethanol ex-
tracts of C. sappan yielded peaks similar to those obtained
upon HPLC of the n-hexane extract. All extracts stimulated
osteoblast proliferation and exhibited anti-osteoporosis
activities [31]. The spectral features of brazilin isolated from
ethyl acetate extracts of C. sappan in the present study
were in agreement with spectral profiles reported in the
literature [25,37].
We studied the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of
brazilin in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model.
CIA mouse model can be used to explore human RA,
because humans and mice are similar both genetically
and immunologically [38]. CIA has been widely used as
the animal model in RA research and demonstrated to
resemble human RA more closely in terms of clinical,Table 2 Comparison of relative organ weights and biochemic

In a preliminary study, brazilin isolated from Caesalpi-
nia sappan L. (Leguminosae) was implicated as a potent
NF-ĸB inhibitor that selectively disrupts the formation of
the upstream IL-1R signalling complex. Analysis of up-
stream signalling events revealed that brazilin markedly
abolished the IL-1β-induced polyubiquitination of IRAK1
and its interaction with IKK-G counterpart. Notably,
pre-treatment of brazilin drastically interfered with the
recruitment of the receptor-proximal signalling compo-
nents including IRAK1/4 and TRAF6 onto MyD88 in
IL-1R-triggerd NF-ĸB activation. Interestingly, brazilin
did not affect the TNF-induced RIP1 ubiquitination
and the recruitment of RIP1 and TRAF2 to TNFR1,
suggesting that brazilin is effective in selectively sup-
pressing the proximal signalling complex formation of
IL-1R, but not that of TNFR1 [40].
We induced the development of chronic inflammation
and closely monitored the effects thereof in terms of joint
edema, erythema, and immobilization. The mean arthritis

Jung et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2015) 15:124 Page 10 of 11and/or brazilin. MTX, a DMARD, is commonly used to
reduce inflammation and joint destruction in RA patients,
but continuous prescription thereof may cause cytotoxic
and genotoxic complications [41,42]. Our data shows that
brazilin inhibits a higher RA disease progression in mice
as compared to anti-rheumatic drug MTX. The serum
levels of inflammatory mediators decreased after adminis-
tration of brazilin in the present study that is in agreement
to the several reports on attenuation of rat CIA by heart-
wood extracts of C. sappan [43].
Wang et al. reported that the ethanol extracts of
C. sappan reduced the serum levels of proinflammatory
cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and expres-
sion of the COX-2 and NF-ĸB transcription factors in
paw cartilage induced in CIA rat (Wistar strain) model
[39]. The incidence of arthritis in CIA-susceptible strains
of mice is generally very high, reaching 50–100% in most
strains [44]. The arthritis incidence rate in male Wistar
rat model was 10-75% [39,43], lower than 80-100% in
the DBA/1J mouse model used in present study.
To evaluate adverse effects of brazilin, we physiologically
monitored the arthritis disease development in mice in
which CIA had been induced (control group), and in
animals receiving MTX and/or brazilin, to assess
whether the drugs might inhibit disease progression.
We found that intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg
brazilin reduced paw swelling to a level comparable to that
noted upon MTX treatment at a dose of 3 mg/kg body
weight every 3rd day.
BMD volumes in CIA-induced control group were
significantly lower, compared to test volumes, in the left
tibial metaphysis, the distal part of the calcaneous, and
the distal part of the metatarsal bone, but did not
improve after administration of MTX or brazilin. The
BMD decreases in control group may be attributable to
increased bone surface erosion and decreased trabecular
thickness. However, both bone volume and surface area
were greater in the control group. These results agree
with those of a study on BMD and micro-CT joint pro-
jection after administration of bisphosphonate, minodro-
nic acid [45]. High-level bone turnover rate near joints
was also observed in a model of carrageenan-induced
arthritis [46]. Both suppression and reduction of BMD
loss near joints are measures of anti-arthritic efficacy
[47,48]. Suppression of bone surface erosion, and main-
tenance of trabecular thickness and the trabecular bone
pattern, upon brazilin administration, reduced the extent
of damage to both bone and joints. Therefore, brazilin
from C. sappan maintained BMD and bone microstruc-
ture, without inhibiting mineralization.
Conclusions
We found that brazilin prepared from ethyl acetate ex-
tracts of C. sappan effectively reduced the serum levels ofTNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; maintained the bone surface
pattern; and decreased both paw swelling and the develop-
ment of gross lesions, in the CIA mice model. These
results suggest that brazilin derived from the heart-
wood of C. sappan may be useful to treat both RA and
other inflammatory disorders.
