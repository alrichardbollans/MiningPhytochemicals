One new meroterpene, 4-[(2’E)-3’,7’-dimethylocta-2’,6’-dien-1’-yl]-5-methyl-2-
(3”-methylbut-2”-enyl)-benzene-1,3-diol, together with eight known compounds, was isolated 
from the MeOH extract from the leaves of Peperomia oreophila Hesch. The prenylated phenol was 
also isolated as main compound from the CH2Cl2:MeOH extract from leaves of Peperomia arifolia 
Miq. The structures of the substances were established on the basis of the spectral evidences and

Introduction
The species Peperomia oreophila Hensch. and 
Peperomia arifolia Miq. belong to the Piperaceae family in 
which the genus Piper (ca. 2000 species) and Peperomia (ca. 
1500-1700 species) are the most abundant.1 Comparatively, 
most of the phytochemical studies have been addressed to 
the Piper species while in the case of Peperomia only few 
species have been subjected to chemical or pharmacological 
scrutiny. The volatile compounds from several other 
Peperomia species were investigated by chromatography-
mass spectrometry (GC-MS).2,3 Nevertheless, in the case 
of Peperomia oreophila Hesch., two rare sesquiterpenes 
having the ishwarane skeleton were isolated from 
its essential oil.4 Indeed, the chemical variability of 
Peperomia species became evident with the isolation of 
amides, benzoic acid/chromenes, flavonoids, lignoids and 
phenylpropanoids.5-8 Additionally, the meroterpenes appear 
to be a noteworthy class of compounds among Peperomia 
species with the aromatic moiety resulting from orsellinic 
acid with a variable degree of prenylations such as those 
described from P. obtusifolia,9,10 P. galioides,11 P. blanda,12 
benzopyrans from P. clusiifolia,13 P. amplexicaulis,14 
prenylated quinones from P. galioides,15 and chromenes 
from P. serpens16 and P. villipetiola.6
As a part of our continuing investigation aiming at the 
chemotaxonomic study of Peperomia species, Peperomia 
oreophila was selected due to the richness of signals in 
the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. The 
phytochemical investigation led to the isolation of a new 
phenol (1), in addition to eight known compounds (2-9). 
The species Peperomia arifolia Miq. was also included in 
this study due to the occurrence of the meroterpene 1 in the 
extract from the leaves as the major compound.
Results and Discussion
The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from the leaves of 
P. arifolia Miq. was fractionated by column chromatography 
on Sephadex LH-20 to afford the new meroterpene 1 as 
the major compound (Figure 1). This new compound 
was also isolated from the MeOH extract from the 
Salazar et al. 783Vol. 23, No. 4, 2012
leaves of P. oreophila. The EtOAc phase, which was 
obtained from the partition of the crude extract, was 
fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 followed by silica 
prep. TLC (thin layer chromatography) to yield additional 
eight known compounds: the prenylated chromene 
8-[(2’E)-3’,7’-dimethylocta-2’,6’-dien-1’-yl]-2,2,7-
trimethyl-2H-chromen-5-ol (2),16 two furofuran lignans 
(7R,8R,7’R,8’R)-3’,4’,5’-trimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy-
8’.8-7’.O.9-9’.O.7-lignan (3) and (7’,8’R,7R,8)-3’,4’,5’-
trimethoxy-3,4,5-trimethoxy-8’.8-7’.O.9-9’.O.7-lignan 
(4),17 three cinnamic acid derivatives methyl (2’E)-3’-
(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylate (5), methyl (2’Z)-3’-
(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylate (6)18,19 and methyl 
(2’E)-3’-(5-methoxy-7,8-benzodioxol-1-yl)acrylate 
(7),8 and two amides (2’E)-N-isobutyl-3’-(5-methoxy-
7,8-benzodioxol-1-yl)acrylamide (8) and (2’E)-N-isobutyl-
3’-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylamide (9).20
Compound 1 was isolated as a brown oil with 
the molecular formula C22H32O2 as indicated by the 
quasi-molecular ion at m/z 329.2485 [M + H]+ in its 
HRESIMS (high resolution electron spray ionization mass 
spectrum). Its infrared (IR) spectrum showed absorption 
bands at 3449, 2967-2857, 1621 and 1450 cm-1 indicative of 
hydroxyl, methine, methylene, methyl
 
and aromatic groups, 
respectively. The 1H NMR displayed two signals at d 6.26 
(s) and 2.20 (s) assigned to aromatic hydrogen and to an 
aromatic methyl group, respectively. The spectrum also 
showed a set of characteristic signals of a prenyl group: two 
hydrogen at d 3.28 (d, J 6.6 Hz) coupled with hydrogen at 
d 5.13 (t, J 6.6 Hz) and, additionally, two methyl groups at 
d 1.81 and 1.73 (s). A second set of signals was observed 
in this spectrum: two hydrogens at d 3.39 (d, J 7.0 Hz) 
coupled with hydrogen at d 5.25 (t, J 7.0 Hz), in addition 
to two multiplets at d 2.05 and 2.09 (2H each) and three 
methyl groups at d 1.80, 1.58 and 1.67 (s), characteristic of 
a geranyl group. The assignment of the prenyl and geranyl 
groups was supported either by coupling constants or by 
HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) data, and 
the 1H NMR data as a whole indicated that 1 has a similar 
structure to that of piperogalin (a prenylated phenol 
previously isolated from P. galioides).11 Nevertheless, in 
spite of the similarities between 1H and 13C chemical shifts 
assigned to benzylic groups (C1’ and C1”), significant 
differences were observed in the chemical shifts assigned 
to C5, C3’ and C3’’. In order to clarify this aspect, the 
HMBC experiment was carried out and the correlations 
observed from H1’ to C3, C4 and C2’, from H1” to C2, 
C3, C2” and C3” and from H7 to C4, C5 and C6 allowed 
the placement of methyl, prenyl and geranyl groups at C5, 
C2 and C4, respectively (Figure 2). Additional correlations 
from H6 to C1, C2, C4 and C7, and from OH to C2, C3 and 
C4 supported the placement of the aromatic hydrogen at 
C6 and of the OH at C3. Further confirmation for this 
substitution pattern on the aromatic ring was made using 
the NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) 
experiment (Figure 2). The compound 1 was thus deduced 
to be the new 4-[(2’E)-3’,7’-dimethylocta-2’,6’-dien-1’-yl]-
5-methyl-2-(3”-methylbut-2”-enyl)benzene-1,3-diol, an 
isomer of piperogalin (Figure 1).
Conclusions
The occurrence of the new phenol 1 (the chromene 2 
in P. oreophila), as well of 1 in P. arifolia together 
with previous chemical studies made on Peperomia 
species,5,9,11-15 suggests that these meroterpenes derived 
from orsellinic acid could be used as taxonomic markers 
for Peperomia species. The occurrence of 1 and 2 in 
these species indicates a specific biosynthetic pathway 
with regioselectivity at the prenylation and geranylation 
steps.

Experimental
General procedures
IR spectra were recorded on a Bomen MB-100 
spectrometer. 1H NMR (300 and 500 MHz), 13C NMR 
(75 and 125 MHz), HMQC (heteronuclear multiple 
quantum coherence, 300 and 75 MHz), NOESY 
(125 MHz) and HMBC (500 and 125 MHz) spectra were 
measured in CDCl3 on Bruker DPX300 and DRX500 
instruments using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as the internal 
standard. LREIMS (low resolution electron impact mass 
spectrometry, 70 eV) spectra were obtained on Shimadzu 
QP-5050 spectrometer. HRESIMS and LRESIMS spectra 
were recorded on Bruker microTOF-QII and on Quattro 
II triple quadrupole equipment, respectively. HPLC (high 
performance liquid chromatographic) analysis were 
performed on a Shimadzu LC20A coupled to SPD20A 
detector or Bruker microTOF-QII mass spectrometer 
using a Phenomenex Luna C18 and MeOH:H2O 3:2 (1% 
formic acid) to 1:0 (30 min) as eluent (at a flow rate of 
0.5 mL min-1 with a delivery of 0.2 mL min-1 for mass 
spectrometer using a flow splitter). The chromatographic 
separations were based on gel filtration through Sephadex 
LH-20 and on prep. TLC over silica gel 60 F254 or 60 PF254 
(Merck), the spots being visualized under a UV lamp (at 
254 and/or 366 nm).
Plant material
Whole specimens of Peperomia arifolia Miq. were 
collected in Brotas County (São Paulo State, Brazil) in 
April of 2004, while P. oreophila Hensch specimens 
were collected in Serra da Piedade (Minas Gerais State, 
Brazil) in June of 2004. Plants were identified by Dr. 
Elsie Guimarães (Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico 
do Rio de Janeiro). Voucher specimens of P. arifolia Miq. 
(Kato-395) and of P. oreophila Hensch (Kato-418) were 
deposited therein.
Extraction and isolation
Peperomia arifolia Miq.
Dried leaves (620 mg) were ground and extracted 
with CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 × 100 mL, 12 h) at room 
temperature. The solutions were concentrated under 
vacuum yielding a crude extract (95 mg). The extract was 
chromatographed by Sephadex LH-20 using a gradient 
elution with n-hexane-CH2Cl2/CH2Cl2-Me2CO mixtures 
to give 20 fractions. These fractions were pooled based on 
their similarities in TLC analysis to yield 5 groups (1-5). 
Groups 1 and 2 were constituted by fatty material while 
groups 3-4 (29 mg) were submitted to a second Sephadex 
LH-20 column, being eluted with n-hexane-CH2Cl2/
CH2Cl2-Me2CO mixtures to yield 1 (16 mg).
Peperomia oreophila Hensch.
Dried and powdered leaves (38.6 g) of plants were 
extracted with MeOH (4 × 600 mL, 12 h) at room 
temperature. The combined extracts were concentrated 
under vacuum resulting in a dark greenish and gummy 
crude material (4.6 g). Part of this extract (600 mg) 
was partitioned between EtOAc/H2O. The organic 
fraction (after drying with Na2SO4 anhydrous) was 
concentrated and yielded 288 mg. The EtOAc fraction was 
chromatographed by Sephadex LH-20 using a gradient 
elution with n-hexane-CH2Cl2/CH2Cl2-Me2CO mixtures 
yielding 28 fractions that were pooled on the basis of 
TLC analysis to F1-F7. F1 (88.6 mg) was subjected to 
prep. TLC silica gel (n-hexane:EtOAc; 4:1) yielding 3 
(58 mg) and 4 (21 mg). F2 (14.2 mg) was subjected to 
silica gel prep. TLC (n-hexane:EtOAc; 4:1) and yielded 3 
(3.8 mg), 4 (2.0 mg) and 5/6 (8.0 mg). Fraction F3 (23 mg) 
was subjected to silica gel prep. TLC (n-hexane:EtOAc; 
4:1) yielding 7 (5.4 mg), 8 (8.8 mg) and 9 (8.6 mg). F4 
(9.6 mg) yielded 1, F5 (45.4 mg) yielded 1 plus 2 and F6 
yielded 2 (6.8 mg).
