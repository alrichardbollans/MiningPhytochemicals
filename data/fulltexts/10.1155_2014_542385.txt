The objective of the present study was to evaluate the anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anticonvulsant activity of the methanolic
extract of Swertia corymbosa (SCMeOH). After acute toxicity test, oral treatment with SCMeOH at doses of 125, 250, and
500mg/kg behavioral models of open field, elevated-plus-maze, actophotometer, rotarod, pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid, and
maximal electroshock induced seizure models were utilized. In open field test, SCMeOH (125, 250, and 500mg/kg) (𝑃 < 0.01,
𝑃 < 0.001) increased the number of rearings. However, the number of central motor and ambulation (𝑃 < 0.01, 𝑃 < 0.001) were
reduced. Likewise, the number of entries and the time spent in open arm were increased while the number of locomotion was
decreased (𝑃 < 0.001) in elevated-plus-maze and actophotometer test, respectively. SCMeOH (125–500 mg/kg) protected the mice
against the pentylenetetrazole and isoniazid induced convulsions; it causes significant (𝑃 < 0.01 and 𝑃 < 0.001) dose dependent
increase in latency of convulsion. Treatment with SCMeOH reduced the duration of the tonic hind limb extension induced by
electroshock. Two major compounds such as gentiopicroside and swertianin were analyzed by HPLC system.
1. Introduction
Mental disorders affect 450 million people worldwide, with
121million suffering fromdepression, and fiftymillion people
are suffering from epilepsy worldwide. Eighty percent of
epilepsy patients are living in the developing countries,
where three-fourths of the patients are not receiving ade-
quate treatment [1]. According to National Commission on
Macroeconomics and Health report, nearly 65–70 million
people in India have some kind of mental illness [2].
Anxiety is a highly prevalent psychological and physi-
ological state characterized by psychomotor tension, sym-
pathetic hyperactivity, and apprehension and vigilance syn-
dromes and affecting one-eighth of the total population of the
world and became a very important area of research interest
in psychopharmacology [3]. Synthetic anxiolytic drugs such
as benzodiazepines (BDZ), diazepam (DZP), and buspirone
(BUSP) are considered as the main category of compounds
prescribed for treatment of anxiety disorders. Unfortunately,
they have several side effects such as tolerance, amnesia,
weakness, loss of sexual drive, gastrointestinal effects and
changes in body weight, sedation, muscle relaxation, and
physical dependence, which lead patients to seek alternative
therapies [4]. In an attempt to resolve these issues, interest
has increased in alternative plant-related drugs. Several
studies have shown that several ethnomedicinal/traditional
medicinal plants have been documented for the treatment of
central nervous system (CNS); these ethnomedicinal plants
could serve as sources of effective medication that may be
more readily accessible and inexpensive and thus would be
helpful in improving the present status [5, 6].
The genus Swertia (family: Gentianaceae) is used in the
Indian and Chinese traditional system of medicine since
prehistoric times. It comprises about 170 species worldwide,

of which 40 species are present in India. Xanthones, sec-
oiridoids, and triterpenoids are the main constituents of
the Swertia species. The extracts of a number of species
have long been used in folk medicine for the treatment
of hepatitis, cholecystitis, pneumonia, dysentery, scabies,
spasm, pain, and neurasthenia. Swertia corymbosa (SC) is
a pharmacologically unexplored, highly bitter species and
is frequently mixed with S. chirayita as a substitute and/or
adulterant [7]. It is an ethnomedicinal plant used for nervous
disorders and sedation [8, 9]. SC has been reported for
analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative,
and antidiabetic activities [10–13]. SC has been extensively
studied for its phytochemical constituents, especially for the
xanthones, iridoid, secoiridoid glycosides, and terpenoids
such as oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, lupeol, and 𝛽-amyrin
have been isolated from different parts of SC [13–15]. Early
researchers found the neuropharmacological activity of some
xanthones, such as gentiacaulein and gentiakochianin [16, 17]
which also have been found in Swertia corymbosa. However,
there is still no direct scientific report for its neuropharma-
cological effect. So the present investigation was designed to
evaluate the anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant activity
of the Swertia corymbosa using animal models, with a view
to establish the pharmacological basis for its neurological
disorder uses in folk medicine.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Plant Collection and Authentication. The aerial parts of
Swertia corymbosa (Griseb.) Wight ex C.B. Clarke were col-
lected from the state of Tamilnadu, India, in October 2010.
The plant was identified and authenticated by Dr. R. Rama-
chandran, a plant taxonomist at BharathiarUniversity, Tamil-
nadu, India, where a voucher specimen with the number BU-
006144 was deposited.
2.2. Preparation of Extracts. The plant material was dried in
the dark at room temperature and powered. Five hundred
grams of the powdered aerial parts of the Swertia corymbosa
(SCMeOH) was extracted with 1.5 l of methanol (100%) in a
soxhlet apparatus for 72 h.Themethanol extract was dried by
removal of the solvent under vacuum.The yield of SCMeOH
was found to be 13.65% w/w.
2.3. Drugs and Chemicals. Isoniazid (S. D. Fine Chemicals);
diazepam (Calmpose Inj. Ranbaxy, India); pentylenetetrazole
(Sigma, USA); methanol extra pure (Rankem).
2.4. Animals. Young male albino Swiss mice (18–25 g) and
Wistar albino rats (150–200 g) were obtained from the Ani-
mal Centre, Department of Pharmacology, Nandha College
of Pharmacy and Research Institute, and were housed in
plastic cages at room temperature with a 12 : 12 h light-dark
cycle. They were fed with balanced rodent pellet diet and
water ad libitum. The animals were acclimatized for at least
1 week before being used for experiments. All the studies
conducted were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics
Committee of Nandha College of Pharmacy and Research
Institute, Department of Pharmacology, and the approval
number was 688/02/C/CPCSEA.
2.5. Acute Toxicity Test. Acute toxicity of SCMeOHwas eval-
uated according to the method described by Organization
of Economic Cooperation and Development Guideline 423
[18]. The animals were kept fasting for overnight providing
only water. The SCMeOH was administered orally at a
dose of 5mg/kg (suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose
(CMC)) initially to separate groups ofmice andmortality was
observed for 3 days. If mortality was observed in 4/6 or 6/6
animals, then the dose administered was considered as toxic
dose. However, if the mortality was observed in only 1 mouse
out of 6 animals, then the same dose was repeatedwith higher
doses such as 50, 300, 500, 1000, and 2,000mg/kg b.w. orally.
The controlmicewere given 10mL/kg of water.Themicewere
observed for behavioural changes and mortality within 24 h.
After this, daily observations for toxicity and mortality were
made up to the 14th day.
2.6. Anticonvulsant Activity
2.6.1. Pentylenetetrazole Induced Convulsions. Pentylenete-
trazole (PTZ) induced convulsions test was performed to
evaluate anticonvulsant property of drugs [19]. Thirty male
mice were divided into five groups, each group comprised
six mice. Different groups were treated with distilled water
(10mL/kg), diazepam (5mg/kg), and SCMeOH at doses of
125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW. Thirty minutes later, convul-
sions were induced by the intraperitoneal administration of
60mg/kg BW of PTZ. Following the administration of PTZ,
mice were placed in separate transparent Plexiglas cages (25×
15 × 10 cm) and were observed for the occurrence of seizures
over a 30min time period. Latency of convulsions (the time
prior to the onset of tonic convulsions), duration of tonic
convulsions, and mortality protection (percentage of deaths
in 24 h) were recorded [20].
2.6.2.Maximal Electroshock (MES) Induced Convulsions. The
animals were divided into five groups, each group comprised
six rats. Different groups were treated with distilled water
(10mL/kg), diazepam (5mg/kg), and ScMeOH at doses of
125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW. Thirty minutes later, con-
vulsions were induced in all the groups of animals using
electroconvulsometer. A 60Hz alternating current of 150mA
for 2 s was delivered through the ear electrodes [21]. The
animal was observed for the occurrence of tonic hind limb
extension.
2.6.3. Isoniazid (INH) InducedConvulsions. Thirtymalemice
were divided into five groups, each group comprised sixmice.
Different groups were treated with distilled water (10mL/kg),
diazepam (5mg/kg), and SCMeOH at doses of 125, 250,
and 500mg/kg, BW. Thirty minutes later, convulsions were
induced by the intraperitoneal administration of 250mg/kg
BW of INH. During the next 30min time period, latency of
BioMed Research International 3
the first clonic convulsion, duration, andmortality protection
(percentage of deaths in 24 h) were recorded [22].
2.7. Assessment of Sedative Activity
2.7.1. SpontaneousMotor Activity. The locomotor activity was
performed as per Adnaik et al. [23] through actophotometer.
The movement (i.e., the number of light-beam crossings) of
the animal interrupts a beam of light falling on a photocell,
at which a count was recorded and displayed digitally. Each
rat was placed individually in the actophotometer for 10min
and the basal activity score was obtained. Subsequently, the
animals were divided into five groups, each consisting of six
animals. Different groups were treated with distilled water
(10mL/kg), diazepam (2mg/kg), and SCMeOH at doses of
125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW. After 60min the rat was placed
again in the actophotometer for observing the activity for
10min [23].
2.8. Rotarod Performance. The equipment of Rotarod was
used to evaluate motor coordination produced by drugs in
animals [24].Themice were trained before the experiment to
acquire the capacity to remain for 300 s on a diameter rod,
rotating at 20 rpm. Two or three trials were sufficient for the
animals to learn this task. Thirty mice were divided into five
groups; each group comprised six rats. Different groups were
treated with distilled water (10mL/kg), diazepam (5mg/kg),
and SCMeOH at doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW.Then,
the animals were placed in the four paws on the rotating
bar, which is 2.5 cm in diameter and 25 cm high from the
floor.The animals were observed for a period of five minutes.
The difference between the fall-off time of the mice before
and after treatment was considered as an index of muscle
relaxation [24, 25].
2.9. Anxiolytic Test
2.9.1. Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) Test. The EPM test is the
most frequently employed model for the assessment of the
anxiolytic activity of novel substances [26]. The elevated plus
maze apparatus consisted of two perpendicular open arms
(50 × 10 cm) and two perpendicular enclosed arms (50 ×
10 × 40 cm). The entire maze was constructed of wood and
elevated 50 cm above floor.Themaze was placed inside a light
(25 lx) and sound attenuated room.
The animals were divided into five groups, each group
comprised six rats. Different groups were treated with dis-
tilled water (10mL/kg), diazepam (5mg/kg), and SCMeOH
at doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW. Thirty minutes
later, the rat was placed in the center platform of the maze
facing the enclosed arm and was observed for 10min. The
parameters assessedwere the time spent in open and enclosed
arms and numbers of open and enclosed arms entries. All
tests were taped by using a video camera and every precaution
was taken to ensure that no external stimuli could evoke
anxiety in the mice. After each test, the maze was carefully
cleaned up with a wet tissue paper (70% ethanol solution) to
eliminate the interference of the olfactory cues on the next rat
[27].
2.10. Open Field Test. The study was conducted according
to method previously described by Brown et al. [28] with
some modifications. The apparatus was made up of plywood
measuring 72 cm × 72 cm × 36 cm. One of the walls was
made of transparent Perspex glass to ensure that the mouse
under investigation is visible to the observer. The floor, made
of cardboard, was divided into 16 equal squares (18 cm ×
18 cm) with blue marker and a central square drawn with
black marker. The cardboard was covered with a transparent
Plexiglas. The animals were divided into five groups; each
group comprised six rats. Different groups were treated
with distilled water (10mL/kg), diazepam (5mg/kg), and
SCMeOH at doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/kg, BW. Thirty
minutes later, each mouse was placed individually at the
corner of the arena and its behavior monitored for 5min.The
number of rearings, ambulation, and central locomotion by
each mouse was recorded. The apparatus was wiped between
observations with 70% ethyl alcohol and allowed to dry to
remove any olfactory cue.
2.11. HPLC Analysis. We performed an HPLC analysis of
SCMeOH for detection and quantification of its major
constituents. A Beckman 125 HPLC instrument (Beckman,
USA) equipped with a Hamilton auto sampler and a 168
photodiode array detector (DAD) was used and the detection
wavelength was set at 254 nm. Separation was carried out
using an ODS-C18 column (150mm × 4.6mm, 5𝜇m). The
injection volume was 10 𝜇L and elution was performed at a
flow rate of 0.8mL/min with the following solvent ratios for
themobile phasewhere solvent A is 1% acetic acid and solvent
B is acetonitrile.The gradient elution was as follows: 0–8min,
2–15% (B), 8–20min, 15% (B), and 20–50min, 15–100% (B).
We used gentiopicroside internal reference and swertianin
was prepared from our previous work and identified by
comparing the 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 2D NMR (H-H
COSY, C-H COSY, and HMBC) data with the literature [10].
Quantification of the main compounds was achieved using
calibration curves that were separately constructed with pure
standards [29].
2.12. Data Analysis. Results of the experiments and observa-
tions were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).The
significance of differences between groups was determined
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by at
least one of the following post hoc tests: Dunnett’s multiple
comparison tests 𝑃 < 0.05 where level of significance was
considered for each test.The data is presented as mean ± S.D.
3. Results
3.1. Acute Toxicity Test. Themethanol extract of Swertia cory-
mbosa (SCMeOH) did not produce any mortality orally up
to 2000mg/kg, but the mice manifested signs of sedation
like quiescence and reduced locomotion at high doses when
observed for 5 h after administration. There were no visible
signs of delayed toxicity and mortality observed when the
animals were monitored for a further 14 days.

3.2. Anticonvulsant Activity
3.2.1. PTZ Induced Convulsion. Pentylenetetrazole produced
tonic seizures in the entire animals used. A dose of 125mg/kg
of ScMeOH protected 33.33% of the animals against seizures
and did not affect the onset (latency) of seizures to any
significant extent. SCMeOH at the dose of 250 and 500mg/kg
protected 50.0% and 100% of the mice against seizures and
significantly (𝑃 < 0.01 and 𝑃 < 0.001) increased the latency
of the seizures (Table 1).
3.2.2. INH Induced Convulsion. Isoniazid (250mg/kg, i.p.)
elicited clonic convulsions in all the animals used.Thenormal
control group produced convulsion and showed latency of
89.20 ± 4.24 s. The methanol extract of S. corymbosa (125–
500mg/kg) significantly (𝑃 < 0.01 and 𝑃 < 0.001) delayed
the duration of ionized induced seizures from 56.77 ± 0.19 s
in control to 41.30 ± 0.20 s, 34.62 ± 1.55 s, and 20.99 ±
2.24 s, respectively and shows dose dependent increase in
the anticonvulsant activity. Similarly, Diazepam 5mg/kg
pretreatment significantly (𝑃 < 0.001) increased the latency
of isoniazid induced seizures from 56.77 ± 0.19 s to 527.11 ±
6.11 s with 100% protection (Table 2).
3.2.3. MES Model. Maximal electroshock produced hind
limb tonic extension (HLTE) in all the animals. The vehicle
treated rats showed tonic hind limb extension for duration of
12.88 ± 0.35 s. Administration of SCMeOH (125–500mg/kg)
showed a dose dependent increase in the delay of the onset
time of seizures induced by maximal electroshock induced
convulsion and also decreased duration of tonic hind limb
extension (Table 3).
3.3. Measurement of Locomotor Activity. In actophotometer
reading, locomotor activity of the plant extract treated was
dose dependently reduced (Table 4).

3.4. Rotarod Performance. Table 5 shows the effects of
SCMeOH from S. corymbosa in the Rotarod test, a method
used for evaluating motor coordination and presence of any
muscle griping effect. It revealed that there was significantly
increased grip force and fall time after administration of
SCMeOH (125, 250, and 500mg/kg) when compared to
control. All the SCMeOH treated animals retained on the
rotating rod for more than 276.35 ± 7.58 s at 500mg/kg
as shown in Table 5, indicate SCMeOH to be devoid of
neurotoxicity.
3.5. Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). Administration of SCMeOH
(125–500mg/kg) to the rats causes the significant (𝑃 < 0.01
and 𝑃 < 0.001) increase in the frequency of the open arm
entries (Figure 1). Significant and dose dependent increase
in the duration of time spent in the open arm was observed
in SCMeOH (125–500mg/kg) treated rats. Extract at doses
of 125–500mg/kg produce a low number of entries in the
closed arm, while control (10mL/kg) had the highest closed

4. Discussions
Medicinal plants have served as sources of readily accessi-
ble, inexpensive, and effective medication since the earliest
times known to man. Several ethnomedicinal plants have
been found to possess neurobehavioral profile and serve as
alternative to modern medicine. Biological evaluation and
scientific validation of the ethnomedicinal plants are the need
of the hour [30, 31]. The present study was proposed to
assess CNS depressant, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects
of methanolic extract of aerial parts of an ethnomedicinal
plant, Swertia corymbosa.
The results of the present laboratory animal study indi-
cate that S. corymbosa SCMeOH possesses anticonvulsant
activity.This observation is in agreement with the findings of
Srivastava et al. [17] who recently reported the neurological
studies of Swertia chirayita (Roxb. ex. Flem) Karsh, another
species and member of the Gentianaceae family, in mice
and rats. The present study demonstrated the anticonvulsant
effects of the methanol aerial parts extract of S. corymbosa in
both chemically and electrically induced seizures inmice and
rats. The extract exhibited dose dependent protection in the
MES, PTZ, and INH tests. Further, like diazepam, the extract
provides 100% protection at 500mg/kg in the INH and PTZ
models. Nevertheless, in unprotected animals, the extract
significantly increased seizure latency and reduced seizure
duration compared with the control group in all threemodels
at all tested doses. The effect of most of antiepileptic agents is
to enhance the response to GABA by facilitating the opening
ofGABA-activated chloride channels. GABAA receptorswere
involved in epilepsy and their direct activation would have
an antiepileptic effect. It is well documented that PTZ/NIH
induced convulsions are produced due to alteration of GABA
level in the brain. Therefore, SCMeOH might possibly be
producing an antiepileptic action by increasing the level

of GABA, an inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous
systems. This is in accord with the pharmacological effects of
benzodiazepine and highlights the relevance of the putative
antiepileptic effects of SCMeOH [23].
In the present study, sedative effect of S. corymbosa
(SCMeOH) is evaluated by using a locomotor activity test.
Locomotor activity is considered as an index of alertness and
a decrease in it is indicative of sedation. The antiepileptic
effects of drugs such as benzodiazepines are accompanied
by decreased locomotor activity and sedation. The extract
inhibited locomotor activity in this experiment. SCMeOH
inhibited locomotor activity to a lesser extent than diazepam
and thus has a better profile for an antiepileptic effect. The
neuropharmacological activities of SCMeOHsuch as sedative
and anticonvulsant effect are similar to the central depressant
properties of extract of plants such as Rubus brasiliensis, Vale-
riana adscendens, Trema cannabina, Heteropterys brachiate,
andMoringa oleifera [1, 32–35].
In the present work, a clear anxiolytic-like activity of
SCMeOH has been observed. The elevated plus maze has
been frequently used to detect and evaluate anxiolytic/
anxiogenic-like properties of drugs. The frequency and time
spent in open arms are the major indexes of anxiety in plus
mazemodel, given the fact that rodents are extremely aversive
to an open area [36]. Diazepam increases the number of
entries into the open arms and increases the time spent in
the open arms, demonstrating the characteristic anxiolytic
effect of BDZ compounds. Results of this study indicated that
the extract has a selective anxiolytic effect with significantly
modifying the locomotor activity like other herbal extracts
where anxiolytic activity is accompanied by sedative and
locomotor effects and these include Xeromphis niclotica [37],
Palisota hirsute [38], Balanites aegyptiaca [39], Viscum album
[40], and Zizyphus nummularia [6].
The anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects of
benzodiazepines like diazepam are mostly attributed to
enhance the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)
[41]. Actually, benzodiazepines bind to the gamma subunit of
the GABAA receptor, due to which a structural modification
of the receptor results in an increase in GABAA receptor
activity. Benzodiazepines do not substitute for GABA, which
bind at the alpha subunit, but increase the frequency of
channel opening events, which leads to an increase in chlo-
ride ion conductance and inhibition of the action potential
[42, 43]. According to some researchers, the anxiolytic action
of benzodiazepines may be due to the direct activation of
glycine synapses in the brain [42, 44]. This may explain the
mechanism of action of our tested extract as well, because it is
clear from the results that the effect of the extract was similar
to diazepam.
Previous phytochemicals reported in the literature, var-
ious xanthones, iridoids, secoiridoid glycosides, and triter-
penoids, isolated from Swertia species would be the effective
constituents. In the present study, we identified the presence
of two major compounds: gentiopicroside and swertianin in
SC methanol extract by HPLC analysis. Gentiopicroside is
secoiridoids and swertianin is a xanthone. Previous studies
have also proved that xanthones like alkanolamides, alka-
nolamines, and aminoalkanolic have shown anticonvulsant
activity [45]. The anxiolytic and antidepressant effect of gen-
tiacaulein and gentiakochianin has been previously reported
[17] and therefore, we suggest that these anxiolytic effects
may be due to the above constituents. Our research group is
undertaking the project of the isolation of active constituents
from S. corymbosa whole plant.
In conclusion, SCMeOH possesses anxiolytic, sedative
and convulsant effects and these findings collaborate with the
ethnomedicinal uses of this plant.The isolation of active che-
micals from this plant might serve as lead compounds for the
synthesis of drugs which could be used in themanagement of
these nervous disorders.
