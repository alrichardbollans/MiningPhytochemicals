Despite recent intensive research efforts in functional genomics, the functions of only a limited number of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
thaliana) genes have been determined experimentally, and improving gene annotation remains a major challenge in plant science.
As metabolite proﬁling can characterize the metabolomic phenotype of a genetic perturbation in the plant metabolism, it provides
clues to the function(s) of genes of interest. We chose 50 Arabidopsis mutants, including a set of characterized and uncharacterized
mutants, that resemble wild-type plants. We performedmetabolite proﬁling of the plants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
To make the data set available as an efﬁcient public functional genomics tool for hypothesis generation, we developed the Metabolite
Proﬁling Database for Knock-Out Mutants in Arabidopsis (MeKO). It allows the evaluation of whether a mutation affects metabolism
during normal plant growth and contains images of mutants, data on differences in metabolite accumulation, and interactive analysis
tools. Nonprocessed data, including chromatograms, mass spectra, and experimental metadata, follow the guidelines set by the
Metabolomics Standards Initiative and are freely downloadable. Proof-of-concept analysis suggests that MeKO is highly useful for the
generation of hypotheses for genes of interest and for improving gene annotation. MeKO is publicly available at http://prime.psc.
riken.jp/meko/.
The availability of the genome sequence of Arabidopsis
(Arabidopsis thaliana) and of postgenomic tools such as
transcriptomics and metabolomics greatly facilitated the
large-scale identiﬁcation of both gene functions and
physiological roles. Based on direct experimental evi-
dence, approximately 20% of all Arabidopsis genes
(approximately 28,000 genes in total) have been assigned
at least one Gene Ontology (GO) term for a biological
process, approximately 27% for a cellular component,
and approximately 13% for a molecular function (Lamesch
et al., 2012). Computational evidence, including homology-
based searches, has also been used to assign at least one
GO term to approximately 77% of all Arabidopsis genes
(Lamesch et al., 2012). The determination and improve-
ment of gene annotation remain important challenges in
the ﬁeld of plant systems biology.
Metabolomics has become a powerful tool for pro-
viding a global snapshot of metabolic behavior in a cell
(Fernie et al., 2004; Fukushima et al., 2009b; Saito and
Matsuda, 2010; Allwood et al., 2011; Lei et al., 2011).
Gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS), liq-
uid chromatography (LC)-MS, and NMR are widely used
in this ﬁeld. GC-MS and LC-MS are sensitive, robust, and

reproducible techniques for the comprehensive metab-
olomic proﬁling of a wide range of metabolites (Tohge and
Fernie, 2009). They facilitated study of the coordination of
carbon and nitrogenmetabolism in plants (Stitt and Fernie,
2003; Rubin et al., 2009; Pracharoenwattana et al., 2010;
Kusano et al., 2011a; Amiour et al., 2012) and studies to
gain a better understanding of regulatory networks in-
volved in genetic perturbation (Roessner et al., 2001;
Weckwerth et al., 2004; Tohge et al., 2005), to characterize
diurnal/circadian behaviors (Urbanczyk-Wochniak et al.,
2005; Gibon et al., 2006; Fukushima et al., 2009a; Espinoza
et al., 2010; Hoffman et al., 2010), to assess altered regu-
latory responses to various abiotic stresses (Kaplan et al.,
2004; Urano et al., 2009; Caldana et al., 2011; Kusano
et al., 2011b; Maruyama et al., 2014; Nakabayashi et al.,
2014), and to identify comprehensive metabolite quanti-
tative trait loci (Morreel et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2006;
Carreno-Quintero et al., 2012; Matsuda et al., 2012).
Database resources, including information on com-
pounds and mass spectra, are essential for MS-based
metabolomics because metabolite identiﬁcation based
on such information is central for gaining insights into
physiological and cellular responses (Fukushima and
Kusano, 2013). The Metabolomics Standard Initiative
(MSI; Sumner et al., 2007) published guidelines regarding
experimental and analytical metadata, including metab-
olite identiﬁcation in metabolomics. Fernie et al. (2011)
have also presented additional practical recommendations
for reporting metabolome data. In this context, Bais et al.
(2010, 2012) developed the ﬁrst metabolite proﬁling da-
tabase with statistical data analysis tools for Arabidopsis
mutants using multiple analytical instruments. The data
include MSI-compliant experimental metadata and freely
available metabolite proﬁles. The data and metadata for
these mutants are archived at the Plant and Microbial
Metabolomics Resource (PMR; http://www.metnetdb.
org/pmr/). The PMR is a ﬂexible, multispecies, Not Only
Structured Query Language-empowered database that is
designed for data sharing and has computational tools
that enable the analysis of metabolomics and tran-
scriptomics data (Hur et al., 2013). Chloroplast 2010 (Lu
et al., 2011) includes information on the large-scale phe-
notypic screening of Arabidopsis chloroplast mutants using
assays of fatty acids and amino acids of more than 10,000
transfer DNA insertion mutants in leaves and seeds
using GC-MS and LC-MS (Gu et al., 2007; Bell et al.,
2012). Although such data resources can provide an op-
portunity to generate testable hypotheses from investi-
gations and evaluations of changes in metabolite levels
for mutants with unknown gene functions (Quanbeck
et al., 2012), only a few databases facilitate the sharing
of metabolomics data.
Because metabolite proﬁling can characterize the
metabolomic phenotype (metabotype) of a genetic per-
turbation of the plant metabolism, it provides clues to the
functions of genes of interest. We chose 50 Arabidopsis
plants, including a set of characterized and uncharac-
terized mutants, that share the same genetic background.
We performed metabolite proﬁling of these plants using
GC-MS. For efﬁcient use of the data set, we developed
the Metabolite Proﬁling Database for Knock-Out Mu-
tants in Arabidopsis (MeKO; http://prime.psc.riken.
jp/meko/), which can be used to browse and visualize
metabotype data. It contains images of mutants, data
on differences in the accumulation of metabolites, and
the results of statistical data analyses. Nonprocessed
data, including chromatograms and mass spectra, and
the corresponding experimental metadata are MSI com-
patible and are freely available from the database. MeKO
is a public functional genomics tool that can be used to
gain insights into individual genes by evaluating whether
their mutation affects metabolism during normal plant
growth.
RESULTS
Experimental Setup and Design Overview
We focused on 180 Arabidopsis mutants with altered
metabolite levels (e.g. ascorbate-deﬁcient mutants); they
were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource
Center (https://abrc.osu.edu/). We tested their seed
germination on Murashige and Skoog agar medium
containing 1% Suc under strictly controlled conditions
(see “Materials and Methods”) and chose 50 mutants
whose seedlings developed healthily under our laboratory
conditions (Supplemental Table S1). Visual inspection
of all mutant plants (390 individuals in total) showed a
resemblance to wild-type plants in 91.5% for the leaf
color, in 92.3% for the leaf shape, and in 98.9% for the
root shape (Fig. 1A). This indicates that most of neither
plant growth nor development was affected in the mu-
tants. Several mutants manifested mutations in genes of
unknown function. Figure 1B shows the results of GO
enrichment analysis for the functional annotation of the
50 mutants. The signiﬁcantly overrepresented functional
biological process categories were involved in the re-
sponse to abiotic stress, cell growth, carbohydrate met-
abolic process, and secondary metabolic process. For
example, in the case of response to abiotic stress, this is
consistent with our choosing some abscisic acid mu-
tants (Supplemental Table S1). All mutants used in this
study are of the Columbia background. To facilitate large-
scale comparative metabolomics studies, we planted the
Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild type on each plate as a con-
trol. Using previously established GC-MS-based me-
tabolite proﬁling (Kusano et al., 2007), we investigated
changes in the metabolite levels of the aerial parts of the
mutants and wild-type plants harvested 18 d after
germination. Based on these data, we constructed
MeKO for use as a functional genomics tool to browse
and visualize metabotypes (Fig. 1C).
Reducing the Systematic Batch Effect in Large-Scale Data
Sets Renders Them Accessible to a Global Comparison of
Arabidopsis Metabotypes
We analyzed more than 650 samples, including 629
plants and 27 quality control samples, by GC-MS (see

“Materials and Methods”). Brieﬂy, our quality control
samples were treated exactly like the experimental
samples and were prepared by mixing 100-mL extracts
of each Col-0 sample. Because these data sets contained
a large number of samples, we analyzed them on 5
different days and preprocessed them separately. In
Table I and Supplemental Table S2, we show all me-
tabolites detected within each batch data set. On average,
95 metabolites were identiﬁed/annotated, including
16 mass spectral tags (MSTs; Schauer et al., 2005). To
compare the metabolic phenotypes of the 50 mutants
simultaneously, we constructed a single data matrix
consisting of the ﬁve data sets (designated the All data
set) with appropriate preprocessing and normalizing
methods. Using this design, we carefully normalized
the data to reduce the so-called batch effect (i.e. un-
wanted nonbiological variations; Leek et al., 2010; Lazar
et al., 2013). Before batch normalization, we observed

nonbiological variations in the score scatterplot of our
principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 2, top). Nor-
malization removed batch effects in the data set, as
evidenced by the score scatterplot (Fig. 2, bottom).
Because adjusting the batch effects renders samples in
different batches directly comparable, we were able to
inspect changes in the metabolite levels across the 50
mutants. We used this single matrix, All, for further
considerations.
Systematic Data Comparison Demonstrates That MeKO
Complements the Information in PlantMetabolomics.org
When we compared the mutants on our list
(Supplemental Table S1) with those generated by the
Arabidopsis 2010 Plant Metabolomics Consortium (Bais
et al., 2010, 2012; Quanbeck et al., 2012; Hur et al., 2013;
http://www.metnetdb.org/pmr/), we found that on both,
pad4-1 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center identi-
ﬁer CS3806; AT3G52430, encoding the ARABIDOPSIS
PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 [PAD4] a/b-hydrolase
superfamily protein; Fig. 3A) was analyzed by GC-MS.
Although there are some differences in the growth con-
ditions and developmental ages between MeKO and the
Arabidopsis 2010 Plant Metabolomics Consortium data,
the metabolite proﬁles can be compared with GC-time-
of-ﬂight (TOF)-MS using data from this mutant. Therefore,
we downloaded the proﬁle data for pad4-1 (experiment
13 E4) from PlantMetabolomics.org. Using MetMask
(Redestig et al., 2010), the chemical identiﬁer conversion
tool, we identiﬁed 43 commonly detected metabolites in
the two data sets. Figure 3B is a pseudocolored heat
map reﬂecting the Pearson correlation matrices for each
data set. The matrix values show the correlation coef-
ﬁcients for sample replicates. Overall, reproducibility
within each data set was very high (red color in Fig. 3B);
however, the correlation between our samples and the
PlantMetabolomics.org samples was not as high as was
the reproducibility (r = approximately 0.3; blue color in
Fig. 3B). This lack of correlation was probably due to
the different growth conditions used.
Cluster Analysis Suggests the Most Pronounced Changes
in the Metabolite Levels among the Examined Mutants
After establishing that our metabolomics data are
amenable to mutant characterization, we attempted to
produce quantitative descriptions of the metabotypes
of the 50 mutants. Figure 4 is an overview of the me-
tabolite levels of the 50 Arabidopsis mutants by mul-
tidimensional scaling (MDS), a statistical technique to
represent similarity among a mutant’s metabotypes,
based on tentatively annotated metabolites as well as
MSTs that were consistently observed but incompletely
identiﬁed (87 metabolite peaks in total). We observed
that the mutant lines ethylene-overproducer1-1 (eto1-1),
vitamin c1-1 (vtc1-1), murus9-1 (mur9-1) and mur11-1,
aspartate aminotransferase2-2 (aat2-2), and root swelling2-1
(rsw2-1) strongly exhibited metabotypes from the other
mutants on coordinate 1 (magenta dotted circles in
Fig. 4). For a wide range of metabolism, the metabolite
levels in these mutants were higher than in Col-0. In
contrast, they were lower in the mur1-1, rsw1-1, and
abscisic acid (ABA)-deﬁcient mutant1-5 (aba1-5) mutants
(cyan solid circles in Fig. 4). Coordinate 2 may reﬂect
speciﬁc local changes in a metabolic pathway. For ex-
ample, while mur9-1 and eto1-1 exhibited signiﬁcant
increases in the polyamine levels (false discovery rate
[FDR] , 0.05), these levels were not changed in eto3
and mur4-3. Compared with Col-0 (e.g. production of
anthocyanin pigmentation1-dominant [pap1-D]; indicated
by the arrow in Fig. 4), the impact on the primary
metabolite levels of mutants at around the origin of
the coordinate axes may be small. We focused on two
mutants, mur9-1 and eto1-1, that exhibited similar changes
in the levels of a wide range of primary metabolites to

investigate the effects of unknown mutations on me-
tabolism (Fig. 5). Both mutants exhibited a signiﬁcant
increase in the succinate level in the tricarboxylic acid
cycle (FDR , 0.05). In addition to an increase in the
level of g-aminobutyric acid, they manifested a dramatic
increase in the level of polyamines. Taken together, such
large-scale comparative metabolomics studies may pro-
vide clues to the mechanisms responsible for functional
loss attributable to mutations.
The Main Contents of MeKO
MeKO features a mutant page, a metabolite page,
and an analysis page. Our database stores information
on the mutants analyzed in this study (Fig. 6A); it
contains a list of entries for the mutant selected from
a panel, including its name, the Arabidopsis Genome
Initiative (AGI) code, its gene name and description
(Fig. 6B), mutant images (Fig. 6C), the results of rep-
licate quality checks, and the volcano plot (Fig. 6D). In
the plot, the top 30 metabolites with signiﬁcant changes
in the metabolite levels are highlighted in blue (|log2
fold change| $ 1, FDR , 0.05). The reader can inspect
changes in the metabolite levels in the selected mutant
(Fig. 6E). Detailed information is provided below.
Mutant Annotation
The main menu provides information on each mu-
tant we analyzed; this facilitates browsing the mutant/
gene of interest (Fig. 6A). Each mutant page includes
Figure 2. An example of unwanted batch effects in metabolomics data. PCA of metabolite data from GC-MS-based metab-
olomics without COMBAT (Johnson et al., 2007; top) and with COMBAT normalization to reduce batch effects (bottom) are

the allele symbol, the AGI code, the gene name and de-
scription, and a cross-link to The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (Lamesch et al., 2012; Fig. 6B). In addition, im-
ages of mutants grown under our growth conditions are
available (Fig. 6C). For example, Figure 6C shows aba1-5
lines that are small in size and weight and have a wilted
shape. Users can compare the mutant of interest with
a Col-0 wild type grown on each plate, thus allowing
integration with morphological phenotype data.
Data Quality Check and Evaluation of Differences in the
Accumulation of Metabolites
Assessment of our metabolomics measurements revealed
adequate reproducibility across biological replicates. This
can be easily veriﬁed by checking the scatterplots and
correlation coefﬁcients among different replicates (Fig. 6D,
top). Using volcano plots, which measure differentially
accumulated metabolites based on t statistics and fold
changes simultaneously, we highlighted the top 30 me-
tabolites with a statistically signiﬁcant difference be-
tween a particular mutant and the wild type (LIMMA
method [Smyth, 2004]; FDR , 0.05; blue plots in Fig.
6D, bottom). A tab-delimited text ﬁle of the results of
the statistical data analysis can be downloaded from
this page.
Proﬁle Mapping to Metabolic Pathways
A ﬁrst step in the interpretation of metabolome data
is to visualize and map the detected metabolites in the
context of metabolic pathways. MeKO features such vi-
sualization and provides a quick overview of the pathway
level of metabolites that display signiﬁcant increases/
decreases in the mutant (Fig. 6E). This visualization
functionality in MeKO contributes to the generation of
testable hypotheses of gene function.
Metabolite Pages
Each detected metabolite is linked to relevant com-
pound databases, such as Chemical Abstracts Service
(http://www.cas.org/), PubChem (Wang et al., 2009),
Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (Degtyarenko
et al., 2008), and KNApSAcK (Afendi et al., 2012). Table II
lists all linked databases. Investigators can use the links
to obtain further information on chemical compounds
of interests. This page also contains links to other
Figure 4. Overview of the metabolite levels of the 50 Arabidopsis
mutants by MDS, a statistical technique to represent similarity among
the metabotypes of a mutant. We used identified and tentatively an-
notated metabolites as well as MSTs (Schauer et al., 2005). The two-
dimensional MDS plot represents similarity in the metabolite profiles
among the 50 mutants. This MDS plot was based on a log2 fold change
calculated by dividing the metabolite level in the mutant by the level
in the Col-0 wild type. Magenta dotted circles indicate strong
metabotypes from the other mutants in coordinate 1; in contrast, cyan
solid circles show mutants that exhibited a decrease. In mutants at
around the origin of the coordinate axes, there was little impact on the
primary metabolite levels compared with Col-0 (e.g. pap1-D; indi-
cated by the arrow).

2012) and AraCyc (Zhang et al., 2005).

DISCUSSION
Our aims were to (1) characterize the metabotype of
a genetic perturbation of plant metabolism and (2)
develop data resources for generating testable hypotheses
on the functions of genes of interest, such as unchar-
acterized Arabidopsis mutants. The MeKO presented
here consists of integrated genotype, metabotype, and
phenotype data and yields consistent information from
raw data to pathway mapping of detected metabo-
lites using interactive tools for data analysis (Fig. 1).
MeKO allows viewing and browsing of proﬁle data,
of morphological image data of the mutants and the
control Col-0, of the results of statistical data analy-
ses, and of annotated metabolites of 50 Arabidopsis
mutants with links to other relevant databases. These
data are accessible to all researchers interested in
metabolomics.
High-throughput data typically contain nonbiologi-
cal variations. As the sample quality is affected by the
day of processing and differences in the staff and
laboratories, so-called batch effects are produced (Leek
et al., 2010; De Livera et al., 2012; Lazar et al., 2013).
Because we included more than 650 samples in our
study, we could demonstrate that removing such batch
effects from our data set by appropriate experimental
designs and by quality control samples allows com-
parison between mutants (Fig. 2). Our experimental
design and data processing highlight the importance
of reducing nonbiological variations for large-scale
comparative metabolomics. The COMBAT algorithm
(Johnson et al., 2007) may not be the best choice for
adjusting batch effects in metabolomics data sets (Chen
et al., 2011). A number of batch adjustment methods are
available (De Livera et al., 2012; Lazar et al., 2013), and
we are in the process of comparing these methods for
their enhancement of the interpretation of metabolomics
data sets.
Based on a comparison of our data set and the
PlantMetabolomics.org data set (Bais et al., 2010, 2012),
we report at least partial mutual data complementarity
(comparing only GC-MS metabolomics; Fig. 3A). For
the interlaboratory comparison of metabolite proﬁles
of pad4-1, the mutant that was analyzed by GC-MS in
common, both data sets exhibited very high reproducibility

between biological replicates in intralaboratory com-
parisons (Fig. 3B). Given that analytical variations in the
metabolite levels obtained from repeated measurements
of individual Arabidopsis plants amounted to approx-
imately 20% (Morgenthal et al., 2006) and that the
variations can be reduced with batch normalization,

the remaining variations may represent intrinsic met-
abolic ﬂuctuations within the individual plants and/or
altered metabolic behaviors that are inﬂuenced by
differences in the environment. The correlation (r =
approximately 0.3) between samples in MeKO and
PlantMetabolomics.org probably reﬂects the effects
of different developmental stages, ages, light con-
ditions, and sampling days (Massonnet et al., 2010).
Our results imply that for interlaboratory com-
parisons of normalized responses in the metabolite
proﬁles from complex plant samples, care must be
taken in the experimental design, especially with
respect to the use of appropriate quality control
samples, experimental setup, and the execution of the
experiments.
The identiﬁcation of metabolomic behaviors under
abiotic stresses such as UV irradiation, cold, and drought
may help us understand differences in the responses to
such stresses. Our ﬁndings emphasize that in conducting
metaanalyses of publicly available metabolomics data
from different laboratories, careful processing of ex-
perimental metadata and the use of NIST Standard
Reference Material (SRM 1950, Metabolites in Human
Plasma; Simón-Manso et al., 2013) are necessary. This
may facilitate the sharing of similar metabolomics data
sets among laboratories.
We found that two mutants, mur9-1 and eto1-1,
exhibited similar metabotypes (Figs. 4 and 5). Both plants
showed dramatic increases in succinate, g-aminobutyric
acid, and polyamine metabolites. More than 15 years
ago, Reiter et al. (1997) used biochemical screening to
isolate mur mutants that manifested an altered mono-
saccharide composition. For example, in mur9-1, Fuc
and Xyl were decreased (Reiter et al., 1997; Reiter,
2008). However, the genes corresponding to this locus
remain to be identiﬁed. Next-generation mapping de-
veloped by Austin et al. (2011) strongly suggested that
MUR11 and SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9 (At3g59770)
were the same gene. Studies on the metabolic coordi-
nation between cell wall synthesis and primary me-
tabolism in plants have focused on different nucleotide
sugars (Reiter, 2008). A close link between reduced
tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and the inhibition of
secondary cell wall synthesis in transgenic tomato
(Solanum lycopersicum) roots has also been suggested
(van der Merwe et al., 2010). The evident relationship
in the aerial parts of Arabidopsis remains largely
uncharacterized, and experimental validation of this
hypothesis is beyond the scope of our study. None-
theless, an unsupervised approach using mutants with
cellulose defects in our data groups may be useful for
the further characterization of murmutants. Our report
documents that MeKO is highly informative for the
generation of testable hypotheses regarding plant func-
tional genomics.
MeKO will continue to grow with the (1) analysis of
other mutants, (2) consideration of genetic and envi-
ronmental perturbations, and (3) full use of various
ecotypes. Increasing the extent of metabolomic detec-
tion is important for a complete understanding of gene
functions. The combined use of multiple analytical
instruments, such as LC-MS, will facilitate the detec-
tion of more diverse metabolites. Like the PMR (Hur
et al., 2013), MeKO with full metabolomic annotation
is a promising functional genomics tool, although the
generation of such data sets is laborious. We expect
our data sets to signiﬁcantly accelerate the develop-
ment and improvement of informatics tools, making
them more useful for the study of metabolomics.
CONCLUSION
We have presented the comprehensive metabolite
proﬁles of 50 Arabidopsis mutants, including a set
of characterized and uncharacterized mutants. We
detected previously hidden alterations in the pro-
duction of metabolites, particularly in primary me-
tabolism. We expect our data to help improve our
understanding of gene function as well as plant growth
and development. We developed MeKO to use the
data set as a functional genomics tool. Metabolites
whose accumulation differs from that of wild-type
plants are conveniently displayed in a metabolic
map that includes relational information. Our analyses
not only revealed the metabotype of each mutant,
but MeKO also can be used for the generation of
testable hypotheses concerning the functions of genes
of interest and is highly useful for improving gene
annotation.

Metabolite Proﬁling
Detailed information on extraction, MS conditions, and GC-MS data pro-
cessing is provided in the Metabolomics Metadata section in Supplemental
Text S1. The All raw data are also available in MetaboLights (Salek et al., 2013;
accession no. MTBLS47) and The MetabolomeExpress (Carroll et al., 2010).
Normalization and Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing, such as baseline correction, peak alignment, and peak
deconvolution, was as reported by Kusano et al. (2007). In brief, most pro-
cesses were based on hierarchical multivariate curve resolution (Jonsson et al.,
2004, 2006) and an in-house mass spectral search program. Detailed information
is included in Supplemental Text S1. We subjected more than 650 samples,
including 629 plants and 27 quality control samples, to GC-MS analysis. Be-
cause these data sets were composed of a large number of samples, we analyzed
them on 5 different days. After careful preprocessing and peak annotation, we
constructed a single data matrix consisting of ﬁve data sets (the All data set) and
separately analyzed each data set (Table I). We prepared mixed extracts of each
sample to reduce unavoidable batch effects (i.e. the nonbiological effects of
different MS conditions, such as detector sensitivity, detector responses, and
column performance) among the data sets. We corrected the variations using
the COMBAT algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007) based on the empirical Bayes
approach. We then applied CCMN normalization (Redestig et al., 2009) to
batch-corrected data to eliminate cross-contribution problems from the data
set. Metabolite identiﬁers were integrated using MetMask (Redestig et al.,
2010), a conversion tool for metabolite identiﬁers.
Statistical Data Analysis
We utilized the BiNGO program (Maere et al., 2005), a software to evaluate
overrepresentation or underrepresentation in a set of genes, for the analysis of
signiﬁcantly overrepresented GO categories. To evaluate batch effects, PCA
score scatterplots and ordinary scatterplots were constructed using the pca-
Methods package (Stacklies et al., 2007). A correlation heat map, a scatterplot
for replicate quality checks, and a volcano plot were constructed using sta-
tistical R software (http://cran.r-project.org/). Differences in the metabolite
levels were detected using the LIMMA package (Smyth, 2004) in R with the
FDR procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We also calculated MDS with
Euclidean distance as implemented in R. This calculation was based on the
log2 ratio of the samples to the Col-0 wild-type samples in each data set. For
mapping the metabolite levels onto the diagram of the metabolic pathways,
the map ﬁle in SVG format was applied manually. The ﬁnal mapped ﬁles were
generated with an in-house Ruby script. Changes in the metabolite levels were
calculated by dividing the metabolite abundance in the mutant by the abun-
dance in the Col-0 wild-type plants; they are represented on a pseudocolor
scale where red and blue indicate increases and decreases, respectively. For
constructing our interactive analysis tools, we used the Shiny package in R
(http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/).
