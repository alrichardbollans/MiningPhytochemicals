ABSTRACT: The genetic variability of the major essential oil constituents in a germplasm 
collection of dill (Anethum graveolens L.) from the National Plant Germplasm System was 
characterized. The oil content in the dill herb ranged from 0.10% to 0.30% (v/fresh 
weight), and in the dill seed from 1.75% to 4.0% (v/dry weight). The three major 
constituents in the dill herb oil were a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene, and 3,9-oxy-p- 
menth-l-ene (ddl ether) comprising90% to97% ofthe totaloilconstituents. Ofthese three 
constituents, a-phellandrene comprised 51.1% to 64.7% of the total oil. The major 
constituents in dill seed oil were carvone and dihydrocarvone comprising 68% to 83% of 
the total oil constituents. The other major constituent was limonene, which ranged from 
14.18% to 21.43%. Carvone was not detected in the herb oil; and dill ether could not be 
detected in the seed oil.

INTRODUCTION: Dill (Anethum gruveolens L.), which is an annual plant of the 
Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family, is native to Europe and commercially produced in 
subtropical and temperate regions such as India, Pakistan, Egypt, United States, Hungary, 
England, Germany and Holland, as well as in northern temperate zones near the Arctic 
Circle in Finland (1). 
Dill seed and herb are used as flavorings in salads, sauces, soups, seafoods, potatoes and 
especially in pickledvegetables. In Finland, the fresh dill herb is used before bud formation 
or during flowering. In the United States, the foliage is harvested prior to flowering and 
marketed as fresh dill, dried or frozen. However, the oil distilled from the fresh herb, dill

weed (leaves and flowering tops), and ripe seeds, are preferred over the fresh product by 
the food industry in Europe and the United States. Dill oil has been shown to have 
antifungal activity (2,3) and to inhibit several species of bacteria (4-7). 
Two species of dill have been of commercial interest: European dill (Anethum gravedens 
L.) and Indian dill (Anethurn sotun Roxb.). The carvone content of the European dill seed 
oil is higher than that of Indian dill seed oil (8). The Indian dill seed oil contains high levels 
of dillapiole, a compound reputed to be toxic (9). The two major components of dill seed 
oil are carvone and limonene, comprising 70-95% of all compounds (8,10,11). However, 
the three major components of the essential oil of dill herb are a- and P-phellandrene and 
dill ether, which together comprise about 80% of the oil (12). Dill herb oil, seed oil and 
weed oil have been previously studied and reviewed (13-15). Recently, Halva et al. (16,17) 
studied the effect of light levels and light quality on the growth and essential oil in dill and 
reported that dill growth and oil accumulation increased with increased light level. 
The present study was conducted to characterize the genetic variability of the major oil 
constituents in dill, grown under identical condltions for both fresh dill herb and dry seeds. 
The origin of the seed used in this study was the US National Plant Germplasm collection. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant Material, Growing Conditions and 
Harvest -Seed samples of the entire dill germplasm collection (56 accessions) held at the 
North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) were direct seeded into a 
Nicollet loam soil (18) at the NCRPIS research farm southwest of Ames, Iowa on 5 May 
1992. Based on prior germination tests, from 200 to 2,000 seeds per accession were planted 
in single 7.5 meter rows. Plots were weeded by hand and thinned to 200 plants per row. 
Plots were irrigated weekly in May and June. A few plants exhibiting symptoms of aster 
yellows were rogued from the field in June. 
Leaf samples were harvested by hand during the late mornings of 14 and 15 July 1992, 
when umbels were first noticeable. Leaves were sampled randomly from each plant, 
including foliage from all locations on each plant. They were harvested from all plants from 
each accession, placed in plastic mesh bags, and held under refrigeration until they could 
be weighed. All samples in excess of 150 g (fresh weight) were shipped by refrigerated, 
overnight express to Purdue University for oil extraction and analysis. Samples less than 
150 g were not analyzed for oil content and composition. 
After leaf harvest, plants were allowed to bolt. On 18 and 24 September 1992, all mature 
umbels were cut by hand, placed in fine-mesh cloth bags, and dried at 30°C for 72 h. Clean 
seed samples were prepared by rubbing the dried umbels by hand, separating the seeds 
with a Clipper air-screen cleaner and an air-column separator, and cleaning by visual 
inspection and hand-picking. Seed samples were weighed and those in excess of 16 g were 
shipped by overnight express to Purdue University for seed oil extraction and analysis. 
Essential Oil Extraction and  Isolation-Essential oil was extracted by both 
hydrodistillation and solvent extraction, and statistically compared in order to determine 
the potential influence ofextraction methodologyon oil composition. For hydrodistillation, 
fresh chopped dill herb was placed in a 2000 mL round-bottomed boiling flask with 400 
mL distilled-deionized water and distilled for 1 h and 15 min using a modified Clevenger 
trap (19). Dried dill seeds were placed in a 2000 mL round-bottomed boiling flask with 
1000 mL distilled-deionized water and distilled for 3 h using the modified Clevenger trap 
(19). The essential oil content was determined on an oil volume to tissue weight basis (20). 
Oil samples were stored in Varian autosampler vials at 2°C in the dark. 
For solvent extraction, 2 g samples of freshly chopped dill herb were ground in a 
JOURNAL OF ESSENTIAL OIL RESEARCH 13 
mortar containing dichloromethane and anhydrous Na,SO and extracted four times 
with dichloromethane to give a total volume of 20 mL oi' extract. The extract was 
concentrated under a gentle stream of air in a fume hood at room temperature and 
was then centrifuged (20). 
Essential Oil Identification and Quantification by GC-Hydrodistilled oil samples 
and dichloromethane extract samples were analyzed by GC using a Varian 3700 gas 
chromatograph equipped with FID and a Varian 4270 electronic integrator (Varian, 
Walnut Creek, CA). A fused silica capillary column (12 m x 0.22 mm) with an OVlOl 
bonded phase (Varian, polydimethylsiloxane) was used to separate the oil constituents. A 
1 pL oil sample was injected with helium as the carrier gas and 1OO:l  split-vent ratio. The 
oven temperature was held isothermal at 80°C for 2 min and then programmed to increase 
at 3"Chnin to 180°C to give complete elution of all peaks. The injector and detector 
temperatures were 180" and 300"C, respectively. Oil constituents were identified on the 
basis of retention time and by co-injection with standard compounds. The relative peak 
area for indwidual constituents was determined by a Varian 4270 integrator (20). 
GCMS Analysis-Pure standards (a-thujene, a-pinene, a-fenchene, P-pinene, myrcene, 
a -  and P-phellandrene, a-terpineol, apiole, cymene, limonene, dihydrocarvone and 
carvone) and essential oil constituents were verified by GUMS. A Finnigan (San Jose, CA) 
GC (9610) and MS (4000) hooked on-line to a Data General N o d 4  data processing 
system, used electron impact analysis as previously described (21,22). The GC conditions 
were as follows: direct injection of 1.0 pL sample diluted 1 O : l  with MeOH; fused silica 
column (30 mm x 0.25 mm) with DB-1 bonded phase (polydimethylsiloxane) (J&W 
Scientific, Folsom, CA); helium as a carrier gas with a column pressure of 72.2 kPa (10.5 
psi) and split vent of 40 mumin; oven program, 80°C at 2 min rising to 180°C at 2"Chnin; 
injector temperature, 225°C. The MS conditions were as follows: ionization voltage, 70 eV; 
emission current, 40 PA; scan rate, 1 scads, mass range, 40-500 Da; ion source tempera- 
ture, 160°C. 
The identification of oil constituents was accomplished by matching the mass spectra of 
each compound with standards or different MS compound libraries for best fit (23-26). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Essential Oil Content-Each of the dill accessions 
are listed by number, country of origin, and oil content in Table I. The oil content of herb 
oil ranged from 0.10% to 0.30% on a fresh weight basis, while the oil content in dlll seed 
ranged from 1.75% to 4.00% on a dry weight basis. In dill herb, the total oil was recovered 
in 1 h 15 min, whereas in dill seed, 3 h was required to recover all the oil. 
The oil of dill has been studied extensively over many years, but a direct comparison of the 
total essential oil content and composition among these studies is difficult because of the 
different methods of isolation and determination, the differences in the geographical 
origin and environmental growing conditions, the different stages of growth when 
harvested, and probable variation in the varieties evaluated (29-31). El-Gengaihi and 
Hornok (32) reportedvalues of 0.24% (fresh weight basis) during the start of stem growth 
(41 days) and 0.46% (fresh weight basis) during the start of umbel growth (48 days). Zlatev 
and Balinova-Tsvetkova (33) reportedvalues of0.68% to 1.40% (dryweight basis) in spring 
and summer sowed plants, at the initiation of stalks. The range of the oil content of dill 
reported from other countries varied from 0.16% to 1.50% on dry weight basis. The oil 
content of dill seed (29) has been reported to vary from 2% to 4% (dry weight basis). In this 
study, the oil content ranged from 0.10% to 0.30% (fresh weight basis) in the dill herb, and 
from 1.75% to 4.00% (dry weight basis) in the dill seed. Our results demonstrating a wide 
range in oil accumulation among accessions apparently due to their wide genetic

*B=a-pinene; F=a-phellandrene; G=P-phellandrene; H=dill ether 
constituent was a-phellandrene, ranging from 51.09% to 64.65%. Three major constituents, 
a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene, and dill ether comprised 90% to 97% ofthe oil constituents. 
The essential oil constituents of dill seed are listed in Table 111. The constituents identified 
in the ddl seed oil included: a-thujene, P-pinene, cymene, limonene, dihydrocarvone, 
carvone and dillapiole. The major constituents in seed oil were carvone and dihydrocarvone 
comprising 68% to 83% of the total oil constituents. The other major constituent was 
limonene, ranging from 14.18% to 21.43%. No ddl ether was detected in the dill seed oil. 
Two oil isolation procedures, hydrodistillation and solvent extraction, were compared for 
dill herb oil constituents in 21 dill accessions. Significant differences in the relative 
amounts of essential oil constituents in the dill oil obtained by hydrodistillation and solvent 
extraction have been reported (27,28). The relative percentages of the four major 
constituents (a-pinene, a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene and dill ether) of dill herb oil 
18 JOURNAL OF ESSENTIAL OIL RESEARCH 
produced by both isolation procedures are presented in Table IV. Eleven constituents 
were identified in the hydrodistilled oil, while only eight constituents could be identified 
in the solvent extract. The most abundant constituents from both extraction methods were 
a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene and dill ether, comprising about 85% to 95% of all 
identified constituents. However, there were differences in the relative percentages of 
constituents between the two methods of isolation. No significant difference in the relative 
amounts of a-phellandrene and P-phellandrene was observed. The lower relative amount 
of dill ether in the solvent extract than in the hydrodistilled oil was matched by higher 
relative amounts of a-thujene, a-pinene, a-fenchene, P-pinene and myrcene in the 
solvent extract. Similar results were reported by Huopalahti et al. (27), except that they 
reported a higher relative amount of P-phellandrene by solvent extract than by steam 
distillation. Since hydrodistillation gave consistent results and the relative amounts of the 
constituents were in agreement with those reported previously, we chose hydrodistillation 
for this study. We tested, but found no effect of storage for two weeks at 10°C of dill herb 
on the relative amounts of aroma compounds (data not shown). This was unexpected as 
Cantwell and Reid (34) reported that fresh dill, stored at temperatures from 0"-10°C, 
maintains a relatively high respiration rate (Q,,value of 4.9). However, they also observed 
that the shelf-life of dill could be maintained at a high market quality for 10-14 days when 
stored at this temperature range. Our data extends their findings by demonstrating 
minimal changes in the aroma of stored dill under these storage conditions. 
Although 20 to 25 constituents could be resolved by gas chromatography in the dill herb 
oil, we are reporting on the 11 identified constituents that comprised 95% to 99% of the 
total oil. The three major constituents were a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene and dill ether 
comprising 90% to 97% of total oil constituents. Of these three major constituents, 
a-phellandrene ranged from 51.09% to 64.65%. The total phellandrene content (a- and 
P-phellandrene) ranged from 65% to 78%. Ihlof (35) found that the typical odor and flavor 
of the herb oil at an early stage of maturity is due to its high content of phellandrene (63% 
to 67%). The relative amount ofthe third major constituent, dill ether ranged from 17.05% 
to 30.18% and is in agreement with that reported by other workers (12,1536). Dill ether 
has been shown to increase markedly at an early stage of maturity and then decrease before 
visible bud formation (37). The abundance of &ll ether in dill herb oil has been reported 
to exhibit an odor similar to fresh d l  herb (12). Limonene and carvone, reported to be 
present as minor constituents in dill herb oil, could not be detected in the present study, 
while myristicin and apiole were present in very low amounts. The high levels of 
a-phellandrene, P-phellandrene, dill ether and the absence of carvone in the herb oil 
of these populations is consistent with the fact that the plants were harvested at an 
early stage of maturity. 
Of the 10 to 15 constituents resolved by gas chromatography in dill seed oil, seven 
constituents were identified comprising 95% to 99% of the total oil. The three major 
constituents comprising about 95% of the identified constituents were limonene, 
dihydrocarvone and carvone. The relative amount of carvone ranged from 18.18% to 
83.15%. The oils low in carvone had higher contents of dihydrocarvone, ranging from 
0.17% to 61.69% (Table 111). There appears to be an inverse relationship between 
dhydrocarvone and carvone (Table 111). Genetic variability in 2,3-keto-reductase, the 
enzyme responsible for converting carvone to dihydrocarvone, may be found among these 
accessions. The other identified constituents included: a-thujene, P-pinene, cymene and 
dillapiole. Carvone and limonene have been reported to dominate in the seed oil (11,38). 
The carvone content has been shown to vary from 40% to 55% in dill seed oil (10,ll). 
Whether carvone is synthesized from limonene in dill seed oil, as has been demonstrated 
in oil of Menthu spicutu L., warrants examination (39). 
Our results indicate a rich diversity in oil constituents of dill herb and dill seed, and an

apparent inverse relationship between dihydrocarvone and carvone in dill seed oil. This 
germplasm collection could be an important source of genetic material for further 
selection and breeding based on known comparative relationships among oil constituents.
