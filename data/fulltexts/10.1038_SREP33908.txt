Eight new tetranortriterpenoids (1–8) were isolated from the twigs and leaves of the Chinese 
mangrove plant Xylocarpus granatum, together with four related known ones (9–12). The structures 
of new compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configuration 
of 9-epixylogranatin A (1) was determined by time-dependent density functional theory-electronic 
circular dichroism (TDDFT-ECD) calculations of the solution conformers. Xylogranatumin A (2) 
represents the first example of the 9, 10-seco limonoid with an unprecedented oxygen-bridged B ring 
(2,7-dioxabicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane). All the isolates were evaluated for the in vitro neuroprotective 
activity, both compounds 11 and 12 displayed moderate effects against H2O2-induced neurotoxicity 
in PC12 cells at the concentration of 10 μM, with an increase in cell viability of 12.0% and 11.6%, 
respectively.
The mangrove plants of the genus Xylocarpus (family Meliaceae) are widely distributed in the coastal areas of 
Southeast Asia, Australia, East Africa, and Indian Ocean. X. granatum, one of the three Xylocarpus species, has 
been used as a folk medicine in Southeast Asia and India for the treatment of diarrhea, cholera and fever dis-
eases1,2. X. granatum was reported as a rich source of limonoids, featuring by their highly diverse and complex 
polycyclic skeletons3–6. These structurally interesting and challenging molecules have attracted great attention for 
their total synthesis, bioactivity evaluation, and biosynthetic studies7,8.
In the course of our ongoing search for bioactive substances from Chinese mangrove plants9–13, the twigs 
and leaves of X. granatum were recently collected from Hainan Province, China. A preliminary chemical inves-
tigation of them has led to the isolation and characterization of the rearranged pyridine-containing limonoids, 
phragmalin orthoesters, and apotirucallane protolimonoids14–16. To further explore the bioactive compounds 
in X. granatum, we continued the phytochemical analysis on the minor components in its twigs and leaves, 
resulting in the isolation and structure elucidation of eight new tetranortritepenoids, named 9-epixylogranatin 
A (1), xylogranatumin A (2), 6-O-acetyl xylocarpin D (3), 14-hydroxy-14,15-dihydrogranatumin C (4), 
30-O-tigloylhainangranatumin J (5), 9-O-methyl xylogranatin R (6), 30-O-acetylhainangranatumin E (7), and 
1,2-dihydro-3α-hydroxy-turranolide (8), along with four related known compounds (9–12) (Fig. 1). Among the 
newly discovered natural products, xylogranatumin A (2) comprises an unprecedented B ring bearing an oxygen 
bridge between C-1 and C-8. Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and bioassay results of these 
compounds, as well as the plausible biosynthetic pathway of compound 2.

compounds. Four known of them were readily identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those 
reported in the literature to be xylogranatin A (9)4, xylocarpin D (10)17, xylocarpin B (11)17, and xylocarpin G 
(12) (Fig. 1).17 On the basis of careful analysis of NMR data, and by comparison with the known compounds, 
the eight new natural products were determined to be tetranortriterpenoids. Among them, 1–6 all showed 
characteristic signals of a α-furyl ring at C-17 position, whereas compound 7 possessed a γ-hydroxybutenolide 
group instead. At the same position, while differed from 1–7, compound 8 exhibited a γ-butyrol lactone moiety. 
Accordingly, the detailed structure elucidation of these new molecules is described as follows.
9-epixylogranatin A (1) was isolated as a colorless gum. The molecular formula of 1 was determined to be 
C34H42O12 by HRESIMS (m/z 665.2554 [M + Na]+, calcd. 665.2574), corresponding to the molecular formula 
C34H42O12, which is the same as that of the co-occurring tetranortriterpenoid, xylogranatin A (9), previously iso-
lated from the seeds of the same species.4 The NMR data of 1 showed diagnostic signals of a furan ring [δC 109.8, 
119.7, 141.2, and 142.9; δH 6.34 (1H, d, J = 0.9 Hz), 7.41 (1H, s), and 7.41 (1H, t, J = 0.9 Hz)], an α, β-unsaturated 
lactone group (δC 117.7, 163.7, and 165.5; δH 6.12 s), and a tetrasubstituted double bond (δC 119.7, C-10 and 136.6, 
C-1). Detailed analysis of 1D (Tables 1 and 2) and 2D NMR (Fig. 2) spectra revealed that the planar structure of 
1 was identical to that of 9.4 In fact, the 13C NMR data from C-3 to C-7 and C-16 to C-23 of 1 are almost the same 
as those of 9, and the main differences at C-1, C-2, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-12, C-15 and C-30, indicated the different 
stereochemistry between 1 and 9 in certain chiral centers. The relative configurations of six stereocenters at C-2, 
C-3, C-5, C-13, C-17, and C-30 were elucidated to be the same as those of 9 by the comparison of their ROESY 
spectral results, as well as by analysis of the coupling constants and splitting patterns of H-2 (δH 3.30, dd, J = 11.1, 
3.8 Hz), H-3 (δH 5.02, d, J = 3.8 Hz), and H-30 (δH 5.10, d, J = 11.1 Hz). NOE correlations observed of H-2/H-3, 
H-2/CH3-28, H-3/CH3-28, and H-3/Ac-30 (Fig. 2) suggested that both H-2 and H-3 were α-oriented. On the 
contrary, the β-orientation of H-5 and H-30 was determined by the significant NOE cross-peak of H-5/H-30. The 
coupling constants of H-2/H-3 (J = 3.8 Hz) and H-2/H-30 (J = 11.1 Hz) indicated that both H-2 and H-30 were 
axial orientation, whereas H-3 was equatorial orientation, which further supported the relative configurations of 
H-2, H-3, and H-30. The diagnostic NOE correlations of H-30/H2-11 and H-30/H2-12 revealed that rings B and 
C were cis-fused, and both 8-OH and 9-OH were α-oriented. Thus, compound 1 was established as 9-epimer of 
xylogranatin A (9).

With the aim to determine the absolute configuration of 1, time-dependent density functional theory elec-
tronic circular dichroism calculations (TDDFT-ECD) of its solution conformers were carried out. The ECD spec-
trum of 1 was recorded in acetonitrile (MeCN), which showed positive, negative and positive Cotton effects (CEs) 
at 270, 243 and 225 nm, respectively. The initial Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) conformational analysis 
of the arbitrarily chosen (2R, 3R, 5S, 8S, 9R, 13R, 17R, 30R) absolute configuration of 1 resulted in 151 conform-
ers, which were re-optimized at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory in vacuo, as well as at B3LYP/TZVP level with 
Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) solvent model for MeCN. The gas-phase re-optimization afforded 9 con-
formers with Boltzmann population above 2%, while the PCM one yielded 14 geometries above 2% (see S46 in 
supporting information). These structures were used as input for ECD calculations. The C-3 tigloyl group is more 
suitable for an axial orientation in the low-energy conformers (conformers A-H), which is in accordance with the

coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 (3J2-Hax,3-Heq = 3.8 Hz). Ring B possesses a twist-boat conformation with 
equatorial 30-OAc group in most of the conformers, which is in agree with the coupling constants between H-3 
and H-30 (3J3-Hax,30-Hax = 11.1 Hz). As to prevent the side effects of the solvent, the ECD spectra were also calcu-
lated for the (2R, 3R, 5S, 8S, 9R, 13R, 17R, 30R) enantiomer with various functions (B3LYP, BH&HLYP, PBE0) and 
TZVP basis set for both the in vacuo and the solvent model re-optimized structures. The computed ECD curves 
of the individual conformers were quite similar to each other, and as well as to the experimental ECD spectrum, 
since their rings D and E share the same orientation. Moreover, all the Boltzmann-weighted ECD spectra repro-
duced well the experimental ECD curve with BH&HLYP/TZVP PCM/MeCN giving the most agreement (Fig. 3). 
Thus, the absolute configuration of 1 was unambiguously determined as (2R, 3R, 5S, 8S, 9R, 13R, 17R, 30R). To 
our best knowledge, this is the first report on the configurational assignment of limonoids with 9, 10-seco skeleton 
by TDDFT ECD calculations.
The related xylogranatin A (9) was only reported for its relative configuration by the X-ray diffraction analy-
sis4, while as it shared the same planar structure as that of 9-epixylogranatin A (1), the absolute configuration of 9 
could then be determined by comparing their ECD spectra, which rely upon the unsaturated δ-lactone and furan 
chromophores of ring D governed by the C-13 and C-17 chirality centers. The similar ECD pattern of 9 [225 nm 
(Δ ε + 23.66), 269 nm (Δ ε + 1.57) in MeCN] and 1 indicated the same (13R, 17R) absolute configuration for both 
compounds. Thus the absolute configuration of xylogranatin A (9) can be deduced as (2R, 3R, 5S, 8S, 9S, 13R, 
17R, 30R), which could further allow the absolute configurational assignment of the related xylogranatins B-D4.
The molecular formula of xylogranatumin A (2), C31H40O12, was deduced by HRESIMS with ion peak at m/z 
627.2431 [M + Na]+ (calcd 624.2417), suggesting the presence of twelve degrees of unsaturation. In the 1H NMR 
spectrum, resonances arising from seven methyl groups were observed, including two geminal (δ 0.92 and 0.94, 
each 3H, s), one terminal (δ 1.08, 3 H, s), one secondary (δ 1.02, 3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz), one methoxyl (δ 3.68, 3H, s) 
and two acetyl groups (δ 2.11 and 2.15, each 3H, s). Diagnostic proton signals represent a β-furan ring (δ 6.38, 
7.41, and 7.43) was also obtained. The 13C NMR spectrum of 2 disclosed seven methyl groups, four sp3 meth-
ylenes, three sp2 methines, seven sp3 methines, and ten quaternary carbons (four carbonyl groups). With regard 
to the 12 degree of unsaturation, and bearing in mind the presence of a furan ring and four carbonyl groups, 
xylogranatumin A (2) should possess five other rings.
The aforementioned data implied that compound 2 bore a similar skeleton as that of compound 1. The 
comparison of the 1D and 2D NMR data of 2 with those of the co-occurring limonoid 1 indicated that they 
shared the similar rings C, D, and E (Fig. 4). Correspondingly, the construction of rings A and B was impor-
tant for the structure determination of 2. Two proton-bearing partial structures of C-19 → C-10 → C-5 → C-6 
and C-3 → C-2 → C-30 were readily recognized from the 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Fig. 5). These two structural 
segments were connected to the quaternary carbons, C-1 and C-4, respectively, by the observation of HMBC 
correlations from Me-19 (δ 1.02, 3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz) to C-1/C-5, H-3 (δH 5.52, 1H, d, J = 3.5) to C-1/C-30, H-2 (δH 
2.08, 1H, t, J = 3.5) to C-1, Me-28 to C-4/C-5 and Me-29 to C-3/C-4. In addition, the HMBC correlations of OH-9 
to C-9 and C-8, as well as the typical hemiketal chemical shift of C-9 (99.8), revealed that the hydroxyl group (δH 
3.30, OH-9) linked to C-9, which was further connected to C-8. The methoxyl group was located at C-7 on the 
basis of the HMBC cross-peak from MeO- to C-7, and the assignment of the two acetoxyl groups at C-3 and C-30 
were clearly indicated by HMBC correlations from H-3 (δ 5.52, 1 H, d, J = 3.5 Hz) to δC 169.8 and H-30 (δ 5.30, 1 
H, d, J = 3.5 Hz) to δC 170.2 (Fig. 4).
In terms of ring B, the presence of one acetal carbon at δC 109.2 (C-1, sp3), one oxygenated quaternary carbon 
signal at δC 89.6 (C-8, sp3), a typical hemiacetal carbon at δC 99.8 (C-9), and a tertiary oxygenated carbon at δC 
71.3 (C-30) suggested that ring B was constructed via the C-8 → C-30 → C-2 → C-1 → O → C-9 → C-8 bond to 
form a tetrahydropyran ring with an oxygen bridge between C-8 and C-1. The linkage of C-30 to C-8 was also 
confirmed by the distinct HMBC correlation from H-30 to C-9. A planar structure of 2 was thus proposed as 
depicted in Fig. 1, which was consistent with its molecular composition and degrees of unsaturation.
The relative configuration of compound 2 was elucidated by the analysis of ROESY spectrum and proton 
coupling constants, as well as by analogy with that of 1. The same relative stereochemistry of C-2, C-3, C-5, C-13 
and C-17 in 2 was deduced from the similar carbon chemical shifts, proton coupling constants, and ROESY 
correlations with those of 1 and the known compounds 10–16 (for C-13 and C-17), as well as by a biogenetic 
consideration of such limonoids in Nature2,17. In addition, the NOE correlations between H-5 and CH3-19, H-10 
and CH3-28, CH3-28 and H-3, H-3 and H-2, H-14 and CH3-18, H-14 and H-30, H-30 and OH-9 (Fig. 4) further 
confirmed the relative configuration of 2R*, 3R*, 5S*, 9S*, 10R*, 13R*, 14R*, 17R*, 30S*. Although the relative 
configurations of C-1 and C-8 cannot be determined by distinct ROE correlations, the correlation between H-30 
and OH-9 implied the β -orientation of the oxygen bridge due to the smaller transannular strain.
Biogenetically, this interesting molecule might be derived from hainangranatumin D (Fig. 5), a limonoid 
previously isolated from X. granatum with absolute configuration established18, by a first plausible weak acid pro-
moted nucleophilic addition of acetoxyl group at C-3 position, which allowed the double bond migration and the 
epoxidation from C-1 to C-9. The resulting intermediate then underwent a C-1 hydration, followed by a second 
acid promoted epoxidation from C-1 to C-8 with the elimination of H2O. Finally, a C-30 epimerization, which 
possibly occurred during the previous epoxidation to lower the energy of the molecule, allowed the production 
of compound 2. Since the relative stereochemistry has been established, the common biosynthetic origin of 2, 
compound 1, the known compounds 9–16 and hainangranatumin D2,4,17,18, suggested the corresponding chiral 
centers, especially C-13 and C-17 adjacent to the furan core should be the same. Therefore, the absolute config-
uration of compound 2 was deduced as (1S, 2R, 3R, 5S, 8S, 9S, 13R, 17R, 30S). Based on the above information, 
xylogranatumin A (2) was determined as a novel limonoid characterized by a 9, 10-seco skeleton bearing an 
oxygen-bridge between C-1 and C-8 (Fig. 1). and the discovery of xylogranatumin A provided a new example to 
the extremely diverse and complex family of limonoids.

6-O-acetyl xylocarpin D (3) gave a HRESIMS pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 769.2634 [M + Na]+, a plus 
of 42 mass units on that of the co-occurring xylocarpin D (10), which was previously isolated from the fruits of 
X. granatum with absolute configuration determined17, indicating the presence of an additional acetyl group in 3, 
which was further confirmed by the careful comparison of their 1H and 13C NMR data (Tables 1 and 2), with an 
observation of additional peaks of δH at 2.19 and δC at 169.6 and 21.0 on 3. The location of the acetyl group at C-6 
was established by the expected downfield shifted 1H NMR resonance of H-6 (from δH 4.29 to 5.30). Therefore, 
compound 3 was determined as the 6-acetyl derivative of xylocarpin D (10).
The HRMS data for 14-hydroxy-14,15-dihydrogranatumin C (4) displayed a pseudomolecular ion peak at 
584.2643 [M]+ (calcd 584.2621), consistent with the molecular formula C32H40O10. Detailed analysis of the 1H 
and 13C NMR data of 4 were reminiscent of those of 13, which was previously isolated from the seeds of a Krishna 
mangrove, X. granatum19. Their main differences were an oxygenated quaternary carbon at C-14 (δC 62.7) and a

methylene carbon at C-15 (δC 40.8; δH 3.53, 1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz; 2.75, 1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) in 4 in replace of the Δ 14,15 
double bond (δC 160.9 and 118.8) in 13. These data indicated that the Δ 14,15 double bond was hydrated in 4, which 
is in full agreement with a plus of eighteen mass units of 4 on that of 13. The HMBC correlations from H-15 to 
C-14 and C-16, and CH3-18 to C-14 gave further support to the structural assignment of 4.
The relative configuration of 4, except C-14 position, was determined to be the same as that of 13 due to 
the similar 13C NMR shifts and coupling constants in 1H NMR and further confirmed by ROESY experiments. 
Unfortunately, the absence of the proton signal of OH-14 in 4, which were usually presented in the NMR spectra 
of the limonoids when measuring in CDCl3, such as Granaxylocarpin C20, bearing the similar substructure as 
compound 4, prevented us from assigning the configuration of C-14 position via the available NMR data.
30-O-tigloylhainangranatumin J (5) was isolated as an optically active white amorphous powder. The 
molecular formula, C32H38O10, was established by HRESIMS from the ion peak at 605.2346 [M+ Na]+. Its 1H 
and 13C NMR data (Tables 1 and 2) were closely related to those of hainangranatumin J (14)18. The only differ-
ence was the replacement of the 30-O-isobutyryl group in 14 by a tigloyl moiety (δH 6.78, q, J = 6.8 Hz, 1.80, d, 
J = 6.8 Hz, and 1.77, s; δC 166.6 qC, 127.6 qC, 139.8 CH, 14.6 CH3, and 11.9 CH3) in 5. Therefore, the structure of 
30-O-tigloylhainangranatumin J (5) was determined as shown in Fig. 1.
The molecular formula of 9-O-methyl xylogranatin R (6), C28H34O9, was deduced by HRESIMS (m/z 537.2100, 
calcd for [M+ Na]+ 537.2101). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 6 were almost identical to those of xylogranatin 
R (15), which was isolated as an antifeedant from the seeds of the same species with the absolute configuration 
established5, except for the presence of an additional methoxy group (δH 3.68; δC 51.8), suggesting that 6 was an 
O-methyl derivative of 15, in agreement with an addition of 14 mass units in 6 to that of 15. The chemical shift of 
C-9 (δ 172.8) in 6 was upfield shifted Δ δ 2.7 from that of 15, indicating the carboxylic acid at C-9 was esterified to 
methyl ester, which was further confirmed by the HMBC correlation from 9-OCH3 (δH 3.67) to the carbonyl car-
bon at C-9 (δC 172.8). The complete assignments of the 1H and 13C NMR of 6 were achieved by a comprehensive 
analysis of 2D NMR spectra including HSQC, COSY, HMBC, and ROESY. Compound 6 was thus determined 
as the methyl ester of xylogranatin R (15). In view of the presence of methyl ester moiety in a great number of 
limonoids previously isolated from this species, such as xylogranatins A-D4, and hainangranatumins A-J18, the 
authors believe that compound 6 is an original natural product rather than an artifact.
The molecular formula of 30-O-acetylhainangranatumin E (7) was established as C29H34O12 by HRMS (m/z 597.1951, 
calcd for [M+ Na]+ 597.1948). The γ-hydroxybutenolide group was characterized by proton signals at δH 7.42 
(H-22) and 6.24 (H-23), and by carbon signals at δC 132.9 (C-20), 169.1/168.8 (C-21), 150.4/149.7 (C-22), and 
97.4/96.7 (C-23) in its 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2). The detailed NMR data analysis reminded us 
those of hainangranatumin E (16), previously isolated from the seeds of Hainan mangrove X. granatum18. The 
only differences were the presence of the acetyl group (δH 2.09 s; δC 169.9/169.8 qC, 21.0 CH3) at C-30 in 7 instead 
of the methylbutyryl group in 16. In addition, two sets of carbon resonances at δ 208.2/208.0 (C-9), 38.6/38.5

(C-13), 164.5/164.3 (C-16), 78.2/77.9 (C-17), 18.4/18.3 (C-18), 169.1/168.8 (C-21), 150.4/149.7 (C-22), 97.4/96.7 
(C-23) in 13C NMR spectrum suggested compound 7 was a mixture of unseparated C-23 epimers as depicted in 
Fig. 1.
1,2-dihydro-3α -hydroxy-turranolide (8) was isolated as a colorless gum. Its molecular formula, C28H42O5, 
was deduced by HREIMS at m/z 481.2892, a plus of two mass units to that of turranolide (17), previously iso-
lated from the root bark of Turraea robusta collected from Awasi, Kisumu District, Kenya21. The NMR spectra 
of 8 were similar to those of 17, except for the presence of oxymethine signal at C-3 (δH 3.42, t, J = 2.8 Hz) in 
1H NMR. A reduction of the ketone at C-3 in 17 to the hydroxyl group in 8 was then easily recognized, which 
further confirmed by the upfield 13C NMR signal at 75.9 in 8 in replace of that at δ 216.2 in 17. In addition, the 
α-orientation of the hydroxyl at C-3 of 8 was confirmed by the ROESY correlations of H-3/CH3-29 and H-5/CH3-
28. The structure of 1,2-dihydro-3α -hydroxy-turranolide (8) was thus determined as the C-3 reductive derivative 
of turranolide (17).
Similar as that of compound 2, since the relative stereochemistry of the new compounds 3, 5, 6, and 8 has been 
established, the common biosynthetic origin of such furan limonoids2,4,17,18 suggested the corresponding chiral 
centers, such as C-13 and C-17 should be the same R configuration. Thus the absolute configuration of the above 
mentioned new compounds could be arbitrary determined as showed in Fig. 1.
In summary, eight new tetranortriterpenoids (1–8) together with four related known compounds (9–12) were 
isolated from the twigs and leaves of Chinese mangrove plant X. granatum. The structures of new compounds 
were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configuration of 9-epixylogranatin A (1) was 
determined by TDDFT ECD calculations, which incidentally allowed the elucidation of the absolute configura-
tions of xylogranatin A (9) by comparison with their ECDs, solving a puzzle of the previously reported natural 
products. The discovery of the 9, 10-seco limonoid 2 with a characteristic 2,7-dioxabicyclo [2.2.1]-heptane ring 
system added a novel skeleton to the family of tetranortriterpenoids, revealing the high diversity and complexity 
of such beautiful molecules.
Neuroprotective activity evaluation. In the light of a wide range of biological activities and pharmaco-
logical properties of limonoids2,8, we performed in vitro investigation of neuroprotective activity of compounds 
1–12 on PC12 cells, since the isolated protolimoloids by us from Toona ciliata var. pubescens displayed signif-
icant cell protecting activity11. Both compounds 11 and 12 showed moderate neuroprotective effects against 
H2O2-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells at the concentration of 10 μM, with an increase in cell viability of 
12.0% and 11.6%, respectively. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was used as the positive control with the increase in 
cell viability of 22.0% at 10 μM. In comparison with the tested structures, it is possible that the variation of rings 
A and B of these limonoids play an important role for the neuroprotective activity.
Methods
General experimental procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter 
341. CD spectra were obtained on a JASCO 810 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-Magna 
FT-IR750 spectrometer. The NMR spectra were measured on Bruker DRX 400 and Varian Inova 600 spectrome-
ters. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported with the residual CDCl3 (δH = 7.26 ppm) as the internal standards for the 1H 
NMR spectroscopy, and CDCl3 (δC = 77.0 ppm) for the 13C NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shifts were expressed in 
δ (ppm) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. 1H and 13C NMR assignments were supported by 1H–1H COSY, HSQC, 
HMBC and ROESY experiments. ESIMS and HRESIMS spectra were recorded on a Q-TOF Micro LC-MS-MS 
mass spectrometer. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatogra-
phy using a VWD G1314A detector at 210 nm and a semi-preparative ZORBAX ODS column (250 mm × 9.4 mm 
i.d., 5 mm particle size. Commercial silica gel (Qing Dao Hai Yang Chemical Group Co., 200–300 mesh) was used 
for column chromatography (CC), and precoated silica gel plates (Yan Tai Zi Fu Chemical Group Co., G60 F-254) 
were used for analytical TLC.
Plant materials. The twigs and leaves of X. granatum (2.0 kg) were collected in December 2009 from 
Dongzhai Harbor, Hainan province, China, and identified by Professor Guo-Rong Xin of Institute of Biological 
Science, Sun Yat-Sen University. A voucher specimen (NO. 09-P-69) is available for inspection at the Herbarium 
of Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Extraction and isolation. The air-dried powdered twigs of X. granatum were percolated with MeOH (three 
times, each 7 days) at room temperature. The extract was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to give 
154 g of residue. The residue was partitioned with EtOAc to afford 29.7 g EtOAc extract. The EtOAc extract was sep-
arated by Sephadex LH-20, MCI and silica gel column to obtain five fractions (1–5). Fr.3 was subjected to silica gel 
liquid chromatography, eluting with CHCl3/MeOH (from 100:1 to 8:2, gradient), to obtain 15 fractions (3A-3O). 
Fraction 3C (65.3 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel with petroleum ether/acetone (8:2 to 1;1, gradient) to 
yield 7 (8.6 mg), and the sub-fraction 3C1. Sub-fraction 3C1 was purified by HPLC (75:25) to afford 5 (1.8 mg). 
Fraction 3D was separated by silica gel column with the eluent of petroleum ether/acetone (8:2 to 7:3, gradient) 
and subsequently purified by semi-preparative-HPLC eluting with MeOH/H2O (70:30) to afford 4 (2.1 mg) and 
6 (2.3 mg). Fraction 3E (2.17 g) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel eluted with a gradient of 
petroleum ether/acetone (9:1 to 1:1) to give nine major fractions 3E0–3E9. 3E7 was separated by silica gel column 
eluted with petroleum ether/acetone (8:2 to 7:3) to afford 12 (30.0 mg) and the sub-fraction 3E7a, which was 
purified by reversed phase HPLC (CH3CN/H2O, 67:33) to yield 8 (5.4 mg), while compounds 3 (1.0 mg) and 11 
(4.8 mg) was prepared by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with petroleum ether/acetone (7:3) from 
fraction 3E9. Fractions 3G was first separated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with petroleum 
ether/acetone (8:2 to 6:4, gradient) to give six sub-fractions (3G1-3G6). 3G3 was purified by reversed phase

HPLC eluted with MeOH/H2O (80: 20) to yield 1 (1.5 mg). 3G4 was separated by reversed phase HPLC (CH3CN/
H2O, 50:50), then subjected to column chromatography on silica gen eluted with petroleum ether/acetone (8:2) 
to give 2 (2.6 mg). Fractions 3G5 and 3G6 were separated by silica gel column chromatography with petroleum 
ether/acetone (70:30) and (65:25) to yield 9 (4.7 mg) and 10 (21.6 mg), respectively.

Neuroprotective bioassay. The neuroprotective activities of compounds 1–12 against hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells were evaluated by using the MTT method22, according to the protocols 
described in previous literature.
Computational section. Mixed torsional/low mode conformational searches were carried out by means of 
the Macromodel 9.7.223 software23 using Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) with an implicit solvent model 
for chloroform. Reoptimizations at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory in vacuo as well as B3LYP/TZVP with PCM 
solvent model for MeCN were carried out followed by TDDFT-ECD calculations using various functionals 
(B3LYP, BH&HLYP, PBE0) and TZVP basis set of the Gaussian 09 package24. Boltzmann distributions were esti-
mated from the ZPVE corrected B3LYP energies in the gas-phase calculations and from the B3LYP energies in 
the PCM ones. ECD spectra were generated as the sum of Gaussians25 with 2400 and 3000 cm−1 half-height width 
(corresponding to ca. 16 and 20 nm at 260 nm, respectively), using dipole-velocity computed rotational strengths. 
The MOLEKEL software package23 was used for visualization of the results.
