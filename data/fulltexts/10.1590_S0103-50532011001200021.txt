O estudo fitoquímico de Calea prunifolia identificou dois compostos derivados de 
p-hidroxiacetofenona, a 1-(2-hidroxi-5-(1-metoxietil)fenil)-3-metilbut-2-en-1-ona apresentou 
atividade anti-inflamatória satisfatória (58.33%), tratando-se de um produto natural. Apesar dos 
dois compostos derivados serem estruturalmente semelhantes, a atividade anti-inflamatória da 
1-(2-hidroxi-5-metoxifenil)-3-metilbut-2-en-1-ona não foi significativa (2.08%). O ensaio foi 
realizado em modelo de inflamação induzido por 12-O-tetra-decanoilforbol-13-acetato (TPA) em 
orelha de ratos. O controle positivo foi testado com indometacina e foram ensaiados controles 
negativos tratados somente com o veículo. Estes resultados possibilitam a identificação de um 
grupo farmacóforo que através de estudos de modelagem molecular e síntese orgânica podem 
resultar em compostos com atividade anti-inflamatória melhorada.
Phytochemical study of Calea prunifolia HBK identified two compounds derived from 
p-hydroxyacetophenone, the 1-(2-hydroxy-5-(1-methoxyethyl)phenyl)-3-methylbut-2-en-1-one 
showed a satisfactory anti-inflammatory activity (58.33%), when considering that this is a natural 
product. Although the two derived compounds are structurally similar, the anti-inflammatory 
activity of 1-(2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbut-2-en-1-one was not significant 
(2.08%). The test was conducted in a model of inflammation induced by topical application of 
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the ear of mice. The positive control was tested 
with indomethacin and the negative control was done only with vehicle. These results allow the 
identification of a pharmacophore group that through molecular modeling studies and organic 
synthesis can result in compounds with improved anti-inflammatory activity.

Introduction
The inflammatory process is a physiological response 
to injuries, traumas, bone fracture, hypersensitivity 
reactions and other diseases,1,2 and causes an accumulation 
of fluid, blood cells, cellular and extracellular constituents 
of connective tissue and produce pain.3 Many current anti-
inflammatory drugs are synthetic, and their toxicity and 
reappearance of symptoms after discontinuation are a 
common problem.4,5 These untoward effects restrict their 
long-term use.6 Hence, there is a constant demand for better 
therapeutic alternatives. For this reason, the search for new 
anti-inflammatory drugs is directed to the research of new hit 
molecules in plants traditionally used as medicinal,7-12 which 
can be modified using organic synthesis to improve activity.
The genus Calea is part of the Asteraceae family, which 
is known for its diverse and important pharmacological 
activities: antimicrobial, vasodilating activity and others.13 
In the searching for compounds, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents/analgesics (NSAIDs) show a promising 
potential because this activity in several genus of plants of 
this family have been widely reported.1,14-16 The reason for 
this property is the secondary metabolites that these plants 
possess. It has been particularly reported in studies involving 
the Calea prunifolia HBK the presence of metabolites like 
as sesquiterpene, acorane,17 eudesmanolides, guaianolides,18 
flavonoids and other.19 So, the aim of this work is to evaluate 
the anti-inflammatory activity of Calea prunifolia HBK and 
the isolation of an active agent.
Experimental
Vegetal material
Calea prunifolia HBK was collected from the Ocaña 
(Norte de Santander, Colombia) and a voucher specimen 
Topical Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Calea prunifolia HBK (Asteraceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2392
(HBK: COL468655) was deposited in the Herbarium of 
the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (HUN).
General procedure
1H, 13C and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectra of isolated compounds were recorded on a Bruker 
DRX 300, operating at 300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 
13C. Chemical shifts (d) were reported in ppm and coupling 
constants (J) in Hz, CDCl3 was used as solvent and 
internal standard. In the direct infusion mass spectrometry 
(DIMS) technique, the sample was directly injected into 
the electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the mass 
spectrometer equipment with ion trap detector (Agilent 
model SL 6300 series). ESI-MS spectra (positive or 
negative mode) were acquired from m/z 100-400. The 
following parameters were used: capillary temperature of 
275 °C, capillary voltage of 20 V, spray voltage of 5 kV, 
tube lens of −5 V. UV-Visible spectra were recorded in 
a ThermoScientific Genesys 10S Spectrometer. Infrared 
spectra were acquired in KBr with a ThermoNicolet 
Avatar 330. Silica gel 60 (200-300 mesh, Merck) was used 
for all separations. While silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) was 
used for analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC), the 
compounds were detected under UV light (254, 366 nm) and 
by spraying with vanillin/H3PO4 followed by heating.
Extraction and isolation
Dried and ground leaves from Calea prunifolia HBK 
were exhaustively extracted by percolation with EtOH at 
room temperature and the extract was concentrate under 
vacuum and at 35 ºC. The crude extract was chromatographed 
on a silica gel column with CH2Cl2 obtaining five fractions 
(F1-F5) followed by CH2Cl2:EtOAc mixtures of increasing 
polarity. Four fractions were collected (F6-F9), the last 
fraction was obtained using MeOH (F10), 500 mL of 
solvent was used in each fraction. Fractions 2-3 yielded 
compound 1 and fractions 4-5 gave compound 2.

Universidad Nacional de Colombia. The experiments were 
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics 
Committee of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and 
the international ethical guidelines for the care and use of 
experimental animals.20 The female ICR mice were fed 
according to a standard diet, food and water access was 
ad libitum, and kept under controlled climatic conditions, 
photoperiods equal to 12 h of light with environmental 
temperature at 21 °C. The test included the substances under 
study. It was administrated for the negative control group 
only the vehicle and the positive control group received 
indomethacin as reference drug.
Ear edema in mice induced by TPA (12-O-tetra-
decanoylphorbol-13-acetate)
Edema was induced in both ears of each mouse by the 
topical application of 2.5 μg TPA dissolved in 20 μL of 
acetone to both the inner and outer ear surfaces (10 μL per 
side). Later, the substances under testing (extracts and 
compounds) dissolved in acetone were applied in the right 
ear in a concentration of 500 μg per ear, using indomethacin 
as reference substance in all cases, the left ear was negative 
control, receiving only vehicle. Four hours later, mice were 
sacrificed and a plug (∅ 6 mm) was removed from both 
the treated and the untreated ears. The weight difference 
between right and left ears was taken as an expression 
of edema. The results were expressed as edema and as 
percentage of inhibition versus the control group.3,12,19,22
Results and Discussions
Structural elucidation
1-(2-Hydroxy-5-(1-methoxyethyl)phenyl)-3-methylbut-
2-en-1-one (1)
The DIMS spectrum showed a quasi-molecular ion 
peak at m/z 235 and 233 in [M + H]+ and [M − H]− mode, 
respectively, corresponding to a molecular weight of 
234 m/z, compatible with the molecular formula C14H18O3.
The 1H NMR (Table 1) and homonuclear correlation 
spectroscopy (COSY) NMR spectra showed the presence 
of an AB system at d 7.5 (d, J 2.0 Hz, H-3), 7.2 (dd, 
J 8.6 and 2.0 Hz, H-5) and 6.80 (d, J 8.6 Hz, H-6); a vinyl 
hydrogen at d 6.6 ppm (s, H-10); a methoxyl at d 3.15 (s); 
two singlet at chemical shift 2.15 (H-13) and 1.99 (H-12), 
indicative of methyl groups in a isoprene system, and 
another methyl group at d 1.2 ppm (d, J 6,3 Hz, H-8) 
coupled in COSY NMR to a methine signal at d 4.2 (q, J 
6.3 Hz, H-7). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed 
four signals corresponding to CH3 group with chemical 
shifts d 56.0, 29.0, 25.2 and 22.5. The one corresponds to a 
methoxyl group as substituent at C-7, the third to methyl in 
C-8, finally, the second and four correspond to two methyl 
groups on double bond of isoprene system C-12 and C-13. 
The signal at d 196.2 ppm was attributed to the carbonyl 
carbon, the signals d 164.74, 134.3, 133.9, 127.7, 120.8 and 
118.9 correspond to a six aromatic carbon atoms in a 
benzene ring. Besides this, the structure was elucidated 
with the help of 2D NMR techniques: heteronuclear 
single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HMQC) and 
heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy 
(HMBC). The HMBC experiment showed correlations 
of C-1 (d 164.74) with H-3 (d 7.5) and H-5 (d 7.2); C-2 
(d 120.8) with H-6 (d 6.80) and H-3 (d 7.5), similarly, H-7 
(d 4.2) correlates with the C-4 (d 133.9) and C-5 (d 134.3). 
The position of de quaternary carbon C-4 was obtained 
through HMBC correlation with the CH3 at (d 1.2).
1-(2-Hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbut-2-en-1-one 
(2)
Comparing the spectroscopic data of the compound 1 and 
2 and the literature,18,22,23 it was possible to determine the 
structure of the second, with some differences between 
both. In the compound 2, the methoxyl group is bonded 
directly to aromatic ring C-4, that way, this carbon showed a 
higher chemical shift, C-4 (d 152.2), affecting the C-3 with 
d 113.3. The other difference was the absence of carbons 
C-7 and C-8. The structures are showed in Figure 1.
These compounds have been previously isolated from 
Calea uniflora and Calea peckii, 1 and 2 respectively, as 
well as compound 1 has been tested on their biological 
activity against trypanosoma parasites and fungi.
Anti-inflammatory activity
The difference between the ear weights of the one only 
treated with TPA and the one treated with the compounds 
indicates the percentage of inhibition (I / %) of the 
inflammatory action (Table 2). In this sense, when it is 
compared the weight of the ears of untreated mice (8.0 mg), 
the weight of those treated with compound 1 (3.3 mg),

giving 58.33% of inhibition. This result when compared 
with the weight of ears of mice treated with indomethacin 
(1.5 mg) with an anti-inflammatory activity of 81.25% (of 
inhibition), it is not very appreciable. On the other hand, the 
activity is considered high when comes to a natural product.
The TPA ear edema model in mice is useful to testing 
pharmaceutical agents or natural products with prospective 
anti-inflammatory activity involved in the inhibition of 
arachidonic acid pathway.19,24 Products of arachidonic acid 
metabolism, such as PGI2 and LTB4, increase vascular 
permeability leading to edema during the inflammatory 
response. So, the use of inhibitors of phospholipase framed 
in the synthesis of AA, such as corticoids, has marked anti-
inflammatory action. Likewise, compounds of inhibiting 
cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes 
have been shown to inhibit TPA induced inflammation.19,25
The main mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents/analgesics (NSAIDs) is involved in 
the inhibition of COX/LOX enzymes, in addition, some 
aromatic compounds, such as acetylsalicylic acid (which 
has a mode of anti-inflammatory action by irreversible 
suppression of the enzyme COX 1), hamper the synthesis 
of prostaglandins by decreasing of the inflammation. 
Similarly, some acrylic acids, such as 4-hydroxybenzene 
derivatives, are able to engage with the active site of the 
cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes.26
Therefore, it is possible to presume that the anti-
inflammatory action shown by compound 1 is due to the 
intervention of this compound to the COX or LOX enzymes 
involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins resulting in the 
decreased inflammatory event.
Taking into account the mode of action of this 
molecule and the type of used assay by testing the 
compounds, we propose the possible mode of action of 
the molecule 1, which suggests an irreversible attachment 
in an active site of an enzyme involved in inflammation, a 
process that is restricted in the molecule 2.
Conclusions
Assuming that the difference between the molecules is 
minimal, the compounds isolated from Calea prunifolia 
HBK are likely to be synthetically modified to enhance 
anti-inflammatory activity with the aim of achieving an 
active and safe compound.
