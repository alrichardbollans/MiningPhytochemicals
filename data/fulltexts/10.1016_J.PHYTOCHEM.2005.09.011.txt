IntroductionTo ensure the survival in the ecosystem, plants producesecondary metabolites with original chemical or biologicalfeatures. If these compounds, introduced in the environ-ment, interfere with the development of other vegetalorganisms, they are called allelochemicals. Among the sec-ondary metabolites, terpenoids show a wide spectrum ofbiological activities including potential allelopathy (Caleraet al., 1995; Skaltsa et al., 2000; Cangiano et al., 2002; Ma-cı́as et al., 2002).In the search for bioactive natural products from Med-iterranean spontaneous plants and weeds (DellaGrecaet al., 2003, 2005), we investigated Cestrum parqui. Thisplant, commonly named green cestrum, has been intro-duced from South America for use as an ornamental shrub0031-9422/$ - see front matter  2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is now naturalised and widely distributed inthe Mediterranean area as one of the major weeds. It growsin dense masses, crowding out other species and it is notedfor its extreme toxicity to farm animals.The phytochemical study of the leaves of the plant hasalready afforded the isolation of 12 C13 nor-isoprenoids,identified by spectroscopic means and chemical correla-tions. These compounds showed phytotoxic effect on thegermination and growth of Lactuca sativa L. (DAbroscaet al., 2004a,b).In this study we have completed the phytochemicalinvestigation of the terpenic fraction of the plants and de-scribed the isolation, characterization and the phytotoxic-ity of more polar novel isoprenoids.2. Results and discussionThe hydroalcoholic extract of the leaves of C. parqui wasconcentrated and performed in a separator funnel, first2682 B. D’Abrosca et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2681–2688with CH2Cl2 and then with EtOAc. The chemical study ofthe first extract led to the isolation of the 12 C13 nor-isopre-noids (DAbrosca et al., 2004a,b). Phytochemical investiga-tion of the EtOAc extract led to the identification of nineterpenoids. The use of NMR experiments (COSY, TOCSY,HSQC, HMBC, NOESY, ROESY) and mass spectrometrytechniques led to identification of four new compounds 3,7, 8, and 9 and five known compounds: the C13 nor-isopre-noids 1 (Macias et al., 2004), and 2 (Calis et al., 2002), theglucosides 4, and 5 (Takeda et al., 1997) and the sesquiter-pene 6 (Jakupovic et al., 1988).Compound 3 (Fig. 1) showed a molecular formulaC16H30O4 as suggested by spectral data and elemental anal-ysis. The 1H NMR revealed the presence of two olefin pro-tons, as a doublet at d 6.16 and a double doublet at d 5.78,three multiplets at d 4.34, 4.20 and 4.18; four diastereotopicprotons of two methylenes as two double doublets were alsopresent, at d 1.81/1.59 and 2.04/1.70, both correlated in aCOSY experiment with the methine at d 4.18. Furthermore,we identified six methyl: three singlets at d 0.91, 1.11 and1.22, a doublet at d 1.26, correlated with the methine at d4.34 in the COSY spectrum, and two coincident doubletsat d 1.35, showing cross peak with the methine at d 4.20.The 13C NMR showed 15 signals in accordance with C13nor-isoprenoidswith an ethereal isopropyl group. In fact, be-sides themethine carbinol alreadymentioned, therewere twotrisubstituted carbinols at d 77.8 and 69.4. These datawere inaccordance with a 3,5,6,9-tetrahydroxy-7-megastigmene. Infact, themethyls at d 1.35were both correlated, in theHMBCexperiment, with the carbon at d 68.2, the proton at d 4.18,assigned to the H-3 proton, was heterocorrelated with thecarbon at d 69.9 and with the methyls at d 21.6. The NOESYexperiment showed a NOE between the H-3 proton and theH-13 and H-12 methyls, indicating its a orientation. TheNMR data of compound 3 were in accordance with thoseOOOHO OHOHOH3OOHOHOOGlcOOGlc1 24 513 59Fig. 1. Polar C13 nor-isoprenoids isolated from C. parqui.reported for (3S,5R,6R,7E,9R)-3,5,6,9-tetrahydroxy-7-megastigmene, suggesting an R configuration for the C-5and C-6 chiral carbons. The absolute configuration to theC-9 carbon has been confirmed by Moshers method(DAbrosca et al., 2004a,b).Compound 7 (Fig. 2) had an unusual sesquiterpenicskeleton. It had a molecular formula C15H22O2 indicatingthe presence of five unsaturations in the molecule.The 13C NMR (Table 1) showed 15 carbon signals iden-tified, on the basis of a DEPT experiment, as three methyls,four methylenes, four methines, and four tetrasubstitutedcarbons, whose values allowed us to identify them as a car-bonyl (d 200.5), an olefinic carbon (d 160.1), a carbinol car-bon (d 76.1) and an aliphatic sp3 carbon at d 40.1. The 1HNMR data (Table 1), together with those derived from anHSQC experiment, showed a singlet olefinic proton at d5.82 bonded to the carbon at d 122.2, a methylene as singletat d 2.45, correlated with the carbon at d 50.0, and twodiasterotopic protons at d 2.43 and 2.29 both correlatedwith the carbon at d 50.2. In the region ranging from2.05 to 1.00 ppm a doublet methine at d 1.72 (bonded tothe carbon at d 57.9), two singlet methyls at d 1.32, and1.15, correlated with the carbons at d 28.0 and 28.4, respec-tively, and a doublet methyl at d 1.03 (J = 6.8) bonded tothe carbon at d 12.2 were identifiable. The 1H–1H COSYand TOCSY experiments showed the following correla-tions: the doublet methyl correlated with the methine at d1.40, which showed cross peak with the methine at d1.90. This proton was correlated with the doublet methineat d 1.72 and with the methylene protons at d 1.48 and 1.98,bonded to the carbon at d 30.4, which were both correlatedwith the methylene protons at d 1.64 and 1.73, bonded tothe carbon at d 39.9. The HMBC experiment furnished use-ful data for solving the structure (Table 1). In fact, the car-bonyl was correlated with both the methylene protons at d2.29 and 2.43 which in turn were correlated with the car-bons at d 39.9, 40.1 and 57.9. This last heterocorrelatedwith the methylene protons at d 1.48 and 1.98, with themethines at d 1.40 and 1.90, and with the methylene at d2.45, and with the methyl at d 1.15. Finally, the latter meth-ylene protons showed interactions with the carbinol andboth the olefinic carbons. These data were in accordancewith an unusual tricyclic structure of a sesquiterpene asshown in Fig. 2. The coupling constant of the H-10methine (10.7 Hz) indicated a trans orientation with theH-9 proton. The relative configurations at the chiral car-bons have been determined by a NOESY experiment(Fig. 3). In the Figs. 2 and 3 compound 7 has been drawnas one of its enantiomer. The H-14 methyl give NOE withthe H-15 methyl, the H-8 methine and with one of the H-6protons, which was also correlated with the H-10 proton.The H-15 methyl showed correlations with the H-9 andthe H-11 proton at d 1.48. Finally, the H-13 methyl gaveNOE with the H-10 methine and the H-2 proton at d 2.43.Compound 8 (Fig. 2) has been identified as 5a-spiros-tane-3b,12b,15a-triol.

D’Abrosca et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2681–2688 2683the molecular peak at m/z 448 and by the elementalanalysis.The 1H NMR spectrum showed six protons geminal toan oxygenated function, four as a double doublets at d4.34, 4.12, 3.52, and 3.28, a multiplet at d 3.59, and a tripletat d 3.39. In the upfield region, two singlet methyls at d 0.99and 0.86 and two doublet methyls at d 1.02 and 0.81 wereevident. The 13C NMR showed five carbinol signals at d82.2, 80,5, 71.2, 69.7, and at d 67.3, apart from an acetal2684 B. D’Abrosca et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2681–2688carbon at d 110.3. In the HMBC spectrum, this signalshowed correlations, with the protons at d 1.88 (H-20),and the methylene at d 3.52 and 3.39. The 1H–1H COSYand TOCSY experiments showed correlations betweenthe doublet methyl at d 1.02 and the methine at d 1.88. Thislatter correlated with the methine at d 2.12, which showedcross peak with the proton at d 4.34. Finally, this latterproton was correlated with the proton at d 4.12. These datawere in accordance with a 3b-hydroxyspirostane skeletonwith an hydroxyl group at the H-15 carbon. The correla-tions, in the HMBC experiment, between the proton at d3.28 with the methyl at d 12.7, bonded to protons at d0.99, and between this methyl with the carbinol at d 80.5localized another hydroxyl at the C-12 carbon. The com-parison of 13C NMR with those present in the literature(Wawer et al., 2001), allowed us to define an a configura-tion for the H-5, H-17 and for the methyls H-21 andH-27 and a R configuration for the C-22 carbon. The ste-reochemistry of C-12 and C-15 carbons was defined by aNOESY experiment. In fact, the H-18 methyl showed aNOE effect with the H-15 proton, justifying an a orienta-tion for the hydroxyl group, while the proton H-12 at d3.28 which showed a NOE effect with the 17a proton justi-fying a b orientation for the hydroxyl group on the C-12carbon.Compound 8 has been described for the first time,although spirostanol glycosides have been already isolatedfrom C. parqui (Baqui et al., 2001).Compound 9 was identified as the pseudosapogenin glu-coside 26-O-(3-isopentanoyl)-b-D-glucopyranosyl-5a-fur-ost-20(22)-ene-3b,26-diol. It had a molecular formulaC38H62O9 as suggested by the13C NMR and the MALDI-MS experiments, which showed the pseudomolecular ionat m/z 663 [M + 1]+.The 1H NMR spectrum showed 11 protons geminal tooxygen. The presence of a doublet at d 4.34 and a methy-lene at d 3.92 and 3.81 suggested a monosaccharide moietyin the molecule. A multiplet at d 4.70, another methylene astwo double doublets at d 3.77 and 3.35, and a multiplet at d3.57 were also evident. The 1H–1H COSY and TOCSYexperiments confirmed this hypothesis, showing correla-tions between the anomeric proton at d 4.34 and a doubledoublet at d 3.49 (H-2 0), which gave cross peaks with andownshifted double doublet at d 4.91. This latter showedcorrelations with a multiplet at d 3.41, which gave crosspeak with the diasterotopic methylene protons. A multipletat d 4.70, another methylene as two double doublets at d3.77 and 3.35, and a multiplet at d 3.59 were also evident.In the upfield region three singlet methyls at d 0.64, 0.81and 1.56 and three doublet methyls d 0.99 (2·) and 0.91were identifiable. A signal was due to a methyl at d 0.91and another due to two coincident methyls at d 0.99. The13C NMR revealed signals due to 38 carbons, which wereidentified, on the basis of a DEPT experiment, as six meth-yls, 13 methylenes, 14 methines and five tetrasubstitutedcarbons. The HSQC experiment allowed the attributionof the protons to the corresponding carbons.The H-3 0 proton of the sugar moiety was heterocorre-lated, in a HMBC experiment, with a carboxyl carbon atd 175.1, which showed correlations with a doublet methy-lene at d 2.28 and a methine at d 2.21, bonded to the car-bons at d 43.5 and 25.9, respectively. These last showedinteractions with two coincident methyls at d 0.99, bondedto the carbon at d 22.3. These data suggested the presenceof an isopentanoic acid esterificated to the hydroxyl groupbonded at C-3 0 carbon of the sugar. The data were sup-ported by the MALDI-MS experiment that showed thefragmentation peak at m/z 417, due to loss of 3 0-isopenta-noyl-b-D-glucopyranosyl group from the molecule. Thecomparison of the remaining carbon signals with those ofcompound 8 and with other related compounds (Tobariet al., 2000), suggested a pseudotigogenin structure forthe aglicone. The HMBC experiment showed correlationbetween the H-27 methyl at d 0.91 with the C-24, C-25and C-26 carbons at d 30.6, 34.9, and 75.3, respectively.Correlations between the H-17 methine at d 2.44 and theC-16, C-18, C-20, C-22 carbons were also evident. Further-more, the correlation between the anomeric proton and theC-26 carbon suggested the presence of the pseudotigogeninlinkage of the 3 0-isopentanoyl-b-D-glucopyranosyl moietyat the C-26 hydroxyl group of the aglicone. The NMR datasuggested the presence of glucose in the molecule. Thishypothesis was confirmed by the GC comparison of thealditole acetate, obtained from hydrolyzed compound 9,with an authentic sample of acetylated glucitol.In order to evaluate the potential phytotoxicity, we havestudied the effects of aqueous solutions of the isolated com-pounds ranging from 104 to 107 M on germination, rootand shoot elongation of L. sativa L. (lettuce). The results ofthe bioassays are reported in Fig. 4.With the exception of compound 2, no significant effectswere observed on lettuce germination. The C13 nor-isopre-noids 1, 4, and 5 had a similar activity, showing a moderatephytotoxicity on both root (Fig. 4B) and shoot elongations(Fig. 4C). On the contrary, compound 2 showed a goodactivity on the germination (Fig. 4A), root and shoot elon-gation at all the tested concentrations. The aglicones of glu-cosides 4 and 5 have been tested on L. sativa (DAbroscaet al., 2004a,b) showed no significant effects: the values in-cluded between ±10% from control. The presence of thesugar moiety enhances the phytotoxicity on the plant devel-opment by inhibiting, in particular, the shoot elongation.In fact, their values achieved about 40% inhibition at thehigher concentrations. Sesquiterpene 6 was inactive, whilethe spirostane 8 was the most active compound inhibiting,the root and shoot elongations at 104 M, about 60%. Atthis concentration, slight effects of over 30% were observedon the seed germination too.The most phytotoxic compounds 1, 2 and 8, have beencompared with the Pendimethalin, a commercial post-emergency herbicide for their effects on seedling growth(Fig. 5). Literature data reported that this herbicide actsas an inhibitor for cell division and elongation (Hess andBayer, 1977; Richard and Hussey, 1999). Furthermore,Fig. 4.

Value presented aspercentage differences from control and are not significantly different withP > 0.05 for Students t-test. (a) P < 0.01; (b) 0.01 < P < 0.05.Fig. 5. Comparison of phytotoxicity of compounds 1, 2 and 8 with thepost-emergency herbicide Pendimethalin (P) on Lactuca sativa L. Valuepresented as percentage differences from control.B. D’Abrosca et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2681–2688 2685studies on the alga Protosiphom botryoides indicated thatgrowth rate, cell number, chlorophyl level and dry weightdecrease with increasing Pendimethalin concentration(Shabana et al., 2001).All the compounds showed a toxic effect similar to her-bicide, especially at the lowest concentration for the ter-pene 2.In conclusion the terpenes isolated from C. parqui, may,play a role in the phytotoxicity of the extract on the lettuce(DAbrosca et al., 2004a,b). The less polar ones seem tohave no relevant effects. The introduction of polar group1–3 or sugar moiety (4, 5) improve their phytotoxicity,probably for the enhanced solubility in aqueous solution.Also spirostanol 8 was active, especially at the higher con-centrations used in the bioassays. This compound showed agood correspondence between concentration and effect forall the measured parameters.3. Experimental3.1. General experiment proceduresNMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz for 1H and125 MHz for 13C on a Varian 500 spectrometer Fouriertransform NMR, in CDCl3 or CD3OD solutions at25 C. Proton-detected heteronuclear correlations weremeasured using HMQC (optimised for 1JHC = 145 Hz)and HMBC (optimised for nJHC = 8 Hz). Optical rotationswere measured on a Perkin–Elmer 343 polarimeter. IRspectra were determined in CHCl3 solutions on a FT-IRPerkin–Elmer 1740 spectrometer. Electronic ionizationmass spectra (EI-MS) were obtained with a HP 6890instrument equipped with a MS 5973 N detector.

A voucher specimen (CE125) has been deposited atthe Herbarium of the Dipartimento di Scienze della Vitaof Second University of Naples.3.3. Extraction and isolationFresh leaves of C. parqui (30 kg) were frozen at 80 C,powdered and extracted with MeOH–H2O (1:9) for 48 h at10 C. The hydroalcoholic solution, after the evaporationof the MeOH, was extracted in a separator funnel firstusing CH2Cl2 and then with EtOAc. Both the organic frac-tions were dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated under vac-uum, yielding 8.0 and 9.2 g of crude residue respectively.Both the organic extracts have been stored at 80 C untilpurification.3.3.1.

Preparation of the alditol acetate of 9A sample of 9 (2 mg) was hydrolysed with 2 N TFA(250 ll) for 1 h at 120 C. Two hundred and fifty microli-tres of isoPrOH were added to the mixture and kept undernitrogen for 1 h. To the dried residue, dissolved in deion-ised water (200 ll), 2 mg of NaBH4 were added in magneticstirring. After 1 h two drops of AcOH were added to elim-inate the excess of hydride and the solution was dried underN2. The residue was kept overnight on P2O5 at room tem-perature. Successively, 250 ll of pyridine dry and 100 ll ofAc2O were added and the mixture was kept in magneticstirring for 30 min at 120 C. After the removal of thesolvent the residue was dissolved in water (0.5 ml),extracted with CH2Cl2 (0.5 ml) and analysed by GLC.3.4. BioassaysSeeds of L. sativa L. (cv Napoli V. F.) collected during2003, were obtained from Ingegnoli S.p.a. All undersizedor damaged seeds were discarded and the assay seeds wereselected for uniformity. Bioassays used Petri dishes (50 mmdiameter) with one sheet of Whatman No. 1 filter paper assupport. In four replicate experiments, germination andgrowth were conducted in aqueous solutions at controlledpH. Test solutions (104 M) were prepared using (2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES; 10 mM, pH 6)and the rest (105–107 M) were obtained by dilution. Par-allel controls were performed. After adding 25 seeds and5 ml test solutions, Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilmto ensure closed-system models. Seeds were placed in agrowth chamber KBW Binder 240 at 25 C in the dark.Germination percentage was determined daily for five days(no more germination occurred after this time). Aftergrowth, plants were frozen at 20 C to avoid subsequentgrowth until the measurement process. Data are reportedas percentage differences from control in the graphics andtables. Thus, zero represents the control; positive valuesrepresent the stimulation of the parameter studied and neg-ative values represent inhibition.3.5. Statistical treatmentThe statistical significance of differences between groupswas determined by a Students t-test, calculating mean val-ues for every parameter (germination average, shoot androot elongation) and their population variance within aPetri dish. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.ReferencesBaqui, F.T., Ali, A., Ahmad, V.Q., 2001. Two new spirostanol glycosidesfrom Cestrum parqui. Helv. Chim.
