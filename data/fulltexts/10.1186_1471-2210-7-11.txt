However, the molecular mode of action and the active principles arepresently not clear. Previously published data have been largely contradictory. We, therefore,investigated the effects of a lipophilic black cohosh rhizome extract and cycloartane-typetriterpenoids on the estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.Results: Both extract and purified compounds clearly inhibited cellular proliferation. Geneexpression profiling with the extract allowed us to identify 431 regulated genes with highsignificance. The extract induced expression pattern differed from those of 17β-estradiol or theestrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. We observed a significant enrichment of genes in an anti-proliferative and apoptosis-sensitizing manner, as well as an increase of mRNAs coding for geneproducts involved in several stress response pathways. These functional groups were highlyoverrepresented among all regulated genes. Also several transcripts coding for oxidoreductaseswere induced, as for example the cytochrome P450 family members 1A1 and 1B1. In addition, sometranscripts associated with antitumor but also tumor-promoting activity were regulated. Real-TimeRT-PCR analysis of 13 selected genes was conducted after treatment with purified compounds –the cycloartane-type triterpene glycoside actein and triterpene aglycons – showing similarexpression levels compared to the extract.Conclusion: No estrogenic but antiproliferative and proapoptotic gene expression was shown forblack cohosh in MCF-7 cells at the transcriptional level. The effects may be results of the activationof different pathways. The cycloartane glycosides and – for the first time – their aglycons could beidentified as an active principle in black cohosh.Published: 20 September 2007BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 doi:10.1186/1471-2210-7-11Received: 25 January 2007Accepted: 20 September 2007This article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11© 2007 Gaube et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

NUTT. (syn. Actaea racemosa;black cohosh, family Ranunculaceae) is a North Americanperennial herb which has been traditionally used byNative Americans for the treatment of rheumatism, dys-pepsia, epilepsy, kidney ailments, dysmenorrhoea and therelief of pain during menses and childbirth [1,2]. Sincethe 1950s, phytopharmaceuticals containing blackcohosh extracts from the rhizome are used for the allevia-tion of menopausal disorders [3]. Since the Women'sHealth Initiative (WHI) described adverse effects of hor-mone replacement therapy (HRT) such as increased risk ofbreast cancer and cardiovascular diseases [4], the popular-ity of herbal alternatives such as black cohosh has consid-erably increased.The phytochemicals in black cohosh rhizomes have beenwell studied, and numerous cycloartane-type triterpeneglycosides (e.g. actein Figure 1), aromatic acids (e.g. caf-feic and ferulic acid), cinnamic acid esters (e.g. fukinolicacid, cimicifugic acids) and various minor compoundshave been reported [1,2,5]. The pharmacology of rhizomeextracts has been investigated, whereby most investiga-tions addressed the effects on the hormonal (estrogenic)system. An estrogen-like activity was reported initially [6-8], but these effects could not be confirmed in later studies[8-11]. Subsequently, antiestrogenic properties were pro-posed on the basis of in vitro experiments [8,12,13].Because a black cohosh extract influenced bone,endometrium and hypothalamus, but not uterus in aestrogen-like manner, it was postulated to contain com-pounds that act as selective estrogen receptor modulators(SERMs) and, therefore, to be different from commonphytoestrogens – a presumption that is still a matter ofdispute [14-17].In binding studies black cohosh extracts showed no affin-ity to estrogen receptors α and β (ERα/β), progesterone(PR) or androgen receptor (AR) [10,16,18,19], but weakaffinity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)[20,21]. Most recently, treatment of human breast cancerMCF-7 cells with black cohosh extracts and with fractionscontaining cycloartane glycosides and cinnamic acidesters, respectively, resulted in antiproliferative effects andinduction of apoptosis [22,23]. Incubation of MCF-7 cellswith a fraction containing the cycloartane glycosides ledto cell cycle arrest at the G1/S- and, to a lesser degree, atthe G2/M-transition points, and treatment with acteinaffected expression levels of some proteins, such as p21, ina G1-arresting manner [24].Finally, irrespective of the putative estrogenic activityrecent investigations reporting dopaminergic [16,25],serotoninergic [26,27] and opioidic action [28] of blackcohosh extracts provide evidence, that the beneficialeffects such as reduction of hot flashes may be due to neu-rotransmitter and CNS activity.Despite all these studies, the mode of action of blackcohosh extracts and the nature of the active principles arepresently not clear.A major limitation of all these studies was that they werealways conducted in a very specific perspective, whileother possible modes of action were ignored. With theemergence of microarrays as a mature technology obser-vation of global drug effects at gene expression level hasbecome possible. This led us to perform a genome-widegene expression profiling experiment to measure globaleffects of black cohosh at the mRNA level. For the studywe used the ERα-positive human breast cancer cell lineMCF-7, a widely used in vitro model for investigations of(anti)estrogenic effects and estrogen-dependent breastcancer. MCF-7 cells were treated with a lipophilic blackcohosh extract. The rationale behind using this extract wasthat ligands for nuclear receptors such as the estrogenreceptors are lipophilic molecules. Parallel experimentswere carried out with 17β-estradiol (E2) and the estrogenreceptor antagonist tamoxifen to compare expression pro-files with these drugs. Gene expression was determinedusing whole-genome Affymetrix GeneChip® HumanGenome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which represents about38500 genes. Microarray results for selected genes wereconfirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. This method wasalso used to analyze the effects of actein, the majorcycloartane glycoside in the rhizomes, and a mixture ofcycloartenol aglycons. The latter was prepared to mimic alikely enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosides in the gas-trointestinal tract prior to absorption.MethodsExtractRhizomes of black cohosh (Cimicifugae racemosae rhi-zoma) were obtained from Caesar&Loretz (Hilden, Ger-Chemical structure of Actein, the major cycloartane-type trit rpene glycoside of black co oshFigure 1Chemical structure of Actein, the major cycloartane-type triterpene glycoside of black cohosh.Page 2 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11many, lot number 82044149). Powdered rhizome (0.5mm particle size, 10 g) were subjected to pressurized liq-uid extraction using an ASE®200 Accelerated SolventExtractor (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) at 120 bar and 70°C.After a preheating step (5 min), the sample was defattedwith petroleum ether (5 min), followed by extraction withdichloromethane for 10 min. Solutions were collected indifferent vials. The petroleum ether solution was dis-carded. After evaporation of the solvent, 350 mg of drydichloromethane extract was obtained.CompoundsThe mixture of cycloartenol aglycons was obtained as fol-lows: A dichloromethane extract of black cohosh rhizome(2 kg) was prepared by maceration at room temperaturefor 24 h. The extract (25.5 g) was separated on a silica gelcolumn (40–63 µm, 70 × 5 cm i.d.) using a step gradientof CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (90:9.5:0.5), CHCl3-MeOH-H2O(70:30:3) and methanol. Fractions were combined on thebasis of their TLC pattern. Fractions containing cycloar-tane glycosides were combined in equal proportions (250mg each) and dissolved in methanol. After addition of 1N HCl, the solution was refluxed for 1 h. Aglycons wereextracted by partitioning with chloroform. The chloro-form extract was evaporated to dryness, and the residue(340 mg) was purified by chromatography on a Sepha-dex® LH20 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column, elutedwith methanol to afford 120 mg of aglycon mixture.Actein was purchased from Phytoplan (Heidelberg, Ger-many), 17β-estradiol from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen,Germany) and tamoxifen from MP Biomedicals(Eschwege, Germany).For subsequent experiments extract and compounds weredissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted withappropriate assay media. The final concentration ofDMSO did not exceed 0.1%. This concentration was alsoused for control experiments.Cell cultureThe human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7(obtained from ATCC) was routinely cultured in Dul-becco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Penicillin/Streptomy-cin (100 U/100 µg/ml) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in ahumidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Before reach-ing confluence, cells were splitted every 3–4 days in a 1:4-to 1:6-ratio. All experiments were performed with cells atpassage numbers 25–33.Hormone-free charcoal-dextran stripped serum (CSS) wasprepared from FBS by agitating with 0.5% charcoal (NoritA) (Serva Feinbiochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) and0.05% Dextran-T70 (Pharmacia) at 37°C for 60 min.After centrifugation at 3500 rpm CSS was filter-sterilized(0.22 µm) twice and stored at -20°C.Proliferation assayMCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well microtitre plates(Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) with a den-sity of 3500 cells per well under culture conditions andincubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 24 hours mediumwas removed, cells were washed with phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS), and phenol red-free DMEM (Gibco™, Invit-rogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% CSSand test substances in concentrations indicated in the textwere added. Medium was exchanged after 72 hours. After120 hours cells were quantified by MTT assay [29,30] asfollows. Medium was removed and 100 µl MTT (Fluka,Buchs, Switzerland), dissolved in phenol red-free DMEMat 0.5 mg/ml, were added to each well. The plates wereincubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 4 hours. Formazancrystals were solubilized by addition of 100 µl of 20%sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) in H2O followed by incuba-tion overnight at 37°C. Optical density was measured at544 nm using a microplate reader (Galaxy FluoStar, BMGLabtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) with backgroundsubstraction. Relative proliferation values were calculatedas percentage of negative control (0.1% DMSO value =100%). Experiments were repeated at least three timeswith 4 to 6 replicates per test concentration. The results aregiven as mean value ± standard deviation (SD). Data wereanalyzed by Student's t-test. Statistically significance vs.DMSO control is represented as *(p < 0.05), **(p < 0.01)or ***(p < 0.001).The acute cytotoxic potential of black cohosh extract,actein and the aglycons was determined with the Cytotox-icity Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche Diagnostics, Man-nheim, Germany). No acute cytotoxicity could be foundfor the extract at concentrations of up to 70 µg/ml, and upto 100 µM for actein and the aglycons, respectively.RNA isolationMCF-7 cells were seeded in 75 cm2 culture flasks (GreinerBio-One) at a density of 20000 cells/cm2 under cultureconditions and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 20hours medium was removed and cells were washed withPBS. Phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% CSS and0.1% DMSO, 15 µg/ml black cohosh extract, 20 µMactein, 30 µM aglycons, 1 nM 17β-estradiol or 10 µMtamoxifen, respectively, were added. Cells were incubatedfor 24 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were washedtwice with PBS and total RNA was extracted from cellsusing the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)including on column DNase digestion according to thestandard protocol. Quantity and purity of the obtainedtotal RNA samples were determined by UV spectroscopy.RNA quality was controlled by gel electrophoresis onPage 3 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/111.5% agarose, stained with ethidium bromide (1 µg/ml).RNA was stored at -80°C until use.Array hybridizationTotal RNA from each sample was labelled and hybridizedto an Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to themanufacturer's protocol (manual version 700217 rev 3),with minor modification. Briefly, 5 µg of total RNA wasconverted into cDNA by using the T7-(dT)24 Primer(Affymetrix Inc), T4gp32 (USB Corporation, Cleveland,OH) and the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase for cDNAsynthesis (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was syn-thesized, cleaned and extracted with phenol/chloroform,followed by ethanol precipitation. Resulting cDNA wasresuspended in 12 µl RNase-free water. From the ds-cDNAtemplate biotin-labeled cRNA was made with the EnzoHigh Yield RNA Transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics,Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified follow-ing the Qiagen RNeasy Clean up protocol (Qiagen) andconcentrated to 24 µl by ethanol precipitation. Fragmen-tation of the biotinylated cRNA (20 µg) was done directlybefore hybridization to the microarray. Hybridizationsand scanning were performed at the Affymetrix GeneChipCore facility of the Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig.On-chip labeling was done with phycoerythrin-conju-gated streptavidin. After final washing steps fluorescencewas detected with the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scan-ner.Primary data analysisInitial data analysis was performed using the AffymetrixMicroarray Suite v5.1 software, setting the scaling of allprobe sets to a constant value of 500 for each GeneChip.Because of the better implemented normalisation algo-rithm data were further normalized using RMA-Expresssoftware [31-33]. With RMAExpress all arrays were visu-ally checked. There were no obvious failures on the chips.RMAExpress is using an enhanced quantile normalization[31,32]. All 8 experiments (4 different treatments – blackcohosh extract, estradiol, tamoxifen and DMSO – induplicate) were normalized together. Data were thenexported to MS-Excel sheets. We used both the log as wellas the natural output. All further comparisons and analy-ses are based on these RMAExpress outputs. Clearly regu-lated (= differentially expressed) genes were determinedusing the following criteria: (I) The signal intensity ishigher than the median of all signal intensities on thearray and (II) in both independent duplicate experimentsthe fold change vs. DMSO control is larger than 1.5.Real-time RT-PCRExpression levels of 14 selected genes were determined bya two step real-time RT-PCR using the LightCycler® system(Roche). Total RNA (5 µg) from each sample was tran-scribed into cDNA with SuperScript III reverse tran-scriptase (Invitrogen) and a 1:1-mixture of randomhexamers (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and oligo-dT(20) primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) fol-lowing the standard protocol. Resulting cDNAs werediluted to a total volume of 100 µl with water (PCR-grade). The reaction mixture for real-time PCR consistedof LightCycler® Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green IMaster Mix (Roche), cDNA and 0,5 µM specific forwardand reverse primers (MWG Biotech) for the genes listed inTable 1. The protocol included an initial denaturationstep at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 5 cycles at 95°C for5 s, 57°C for 10 s and 72°C for 17 s and finally 45 cyclesat 95°C for 5 s, 59°C for 10 s and 72°C for 17 s. Ratiosbetween sample and control experiments were calculatedafter normalization of expression values to the house-keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH). All RT-PCR expression values were determinedat least three times from 2 independent biological experi-ments (treatments in duplicate). Data were analyzed byStudent's t-test.ResultsProliferation assayWe first performed a MTT-based proliferation assay toexplore how the black cohosh extract and the selectedcompounds influence growth of MCF-7 cells. 17β-estra-diol, the positive control, significantly stimulated cell pro-liferation after 120 h, reaching a plateau of maximalstimulation (184.2 ± 28.1% vs. DMSO control; p < 0.001)at a concentration of 1 nM. The magnitude was compara-ble to effects observed in other studies with MCF-7(ATCC) cells [11,34,35]. At a concentration of 10 µMtamoxifen reduced cell proliferation to 45.7 ± 6.8% (p <0.001 vs. DMSO control). Exposure of MCF-7 cells for 120h to different concentrations of black cohosh extract, thecycloartane glycoside actein and the cycloartane aglyconmixture all inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-depend-ent manner (Figure 2). IC50 values – the concentrationsthat caused 50% inhibition of growth – were determinedby extrapolation for black cohosh extract (14.7 ± 2.6 µg/ml), actein (19.6 ± 3.1 µM) and the aglycon mixture (30.3± 0.5 µM). These proliferation and cytotoxicity measure-ments provide only a preliminary information of biologi-cal activity.Gene expression microarray analysis with black cohosh extractGeneral resultsFor gene expression profiling MCF-7 cells were treatedwith 15 µg/ml black cohosh extract, 1 nM 17β-estradiol,10 µM tamoxifen or DMSO control for 24 h in the pres-ence of 10% charcoal stripped serum. After RNA extrac-tion, gene expression profiles were recorded usingAffymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip Arrays asPage 4 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11described. Regulated (differentially expressed) genes wereidentified using the following selection criteria: minimalsignal intensity > median and fold change vs. control > 1.5in two independent experiments. With these criteria weidentified 544 probe sets (~1% from the more than 54000probe sets on the HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array) representing431 genes regulated by the extract. The false positive ratewith the criteria used is about 5% based on random per-mutation analysis of the gene expression results, showinga mean of 22 to 32 regulated probe sets (22/544 ~ 4.0%;32/544 ~ 5.9%).Of the genes regulated by the extract, 335 transcripts(78%) were upregulated and 96 genes (22%) were down-regulated. These genes were grouped into functional cate-gories according to Gene Ontology terms and genedescription at the NetAffx™ Analysis Center [36] and addi-tion literature search. Most of the regulated genes could beclearly assigned to 5 larger groups of functionally relatedgenes (subgroups in brackets): apoptosis, proliferation (cellcycle, replication), general growth (RNA processing, proteinturnover, transcription, cell structure and organization), signal-ing & transport (signal transduction, transport) and metabo-lism (oxidoreductases, biosynthesis and catabolism). Genesthat could not be assigned to any of these groups weresummarized as others (Figure 3). Furthermore, because ofa striking presence of many transcripts linked to cellularstress response, we also created the functional categorystress response, which is not directly linked to the other cat-egories. Genes functionally connected to this group arealready members of one of the 6 main categories (Figure3). In most groups more genes were stimulated thaninhibited. In the group proliferation, in contrast, a majorityof genes appeared to be downregulated. Genes for this cat-egory as well as the groups/subgroups apoptosis, proteinturnover, oxidoreductases and stress response are all statisti-cally overrepresented among the black cohosh regulatedgenes (p < 0.001, two-sided p-value Fisher Exact Test). Fortwo groups – proliferation (cell cycle, DNA replication) andstress response – the overrepresentation is very highly sig-nificant.Regulation of 13 genes representing the 6 functional cate-gories, apoptosis, proliferation, general growth, signaling &transport, metabolism and others, were verified by real-timeRT-PCR from independent samples to confirm the regula-tion of genes connected to the major cellular effectsobserved.Table 1: Primers used for real-time RT-PCRGene Primer Sequence 5'-3' Product SizeBaculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5) for AAAGCATTCGTCCGGTTG 152 bprev CCGCAGTTTCCTCAAATTCTCyclin E2 (CCNE2) for GACTGCTGCTGCCTTGTG 151 bprev AAAAGTCTTCAGCTTCACTGGACyclin G2 (CCNG2) for CCCAGAACCTCCACAACAG 158 bprev GGTGCACTCTTGATCACTGGCytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) for TCTTCGCTACCTACCCAACC 196 bprev ATCTGACAGCTGGACATTGGCytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1) for AGAACGTACCGGCCACTATC 175 bprev GGCTGGTCACCCATACAAGDNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) for GTTTGACCGCTCCACGAG 166 bprev CATCAGGTTGGCACACAAGTDnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 9 (DNAJB9) for GGATGCTGAAGCAAAATTCA 150 bprev AATGACTGCTCAAAAGAACTTCCE2F transcription factor 2 (E2F2) for CGCATCTATGACATCACCAAC 157 bprev TGTTCATCAGCTCCTTCAGCEstrogen receptor, alpha (ESR1) for CAGACACTTTGATCCACCTGA 179 bprev CTCCAGCAGCAGGTCATAGAGREB1 protein (GREB1) for ATCATCCTGAACGTGGACCT 151 bprev CCACGATCTGCTTCTTCATCGrowth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha (GADD45A) for GGAGGAAGTGCTCAGCAAA 169 bprev CTGGATCAGGGTGAAGTGGMetastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT-1) for TGCAATTTGGTGATGAAGGT 161 bprev CAACATATTGCCGACCTCACProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for TTGCACTGAGGTACCTGAACTT 160 bprev CCTTCTTCATCCTCGATCTTGVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for CATCTTCAAGCCATCCTGTG 179 bprev TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for ACCAGGTGGTCTCCTCTGAC 173 bprev TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTPage 5 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11The cellular effects of the functional groups regulated byblack cohosh are summarized in Figure 4. Expression val-ues of selected genes are presented in Table 2. A completelist of all regulated genes is available [see Additional file1]. The data discussed in this publication have also beendeposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)[37], and are accessible through GEO Series accessionnumber GSE6800.ProliferationIn agreement with the anti-proliferative effect of the blackcohosh extract, genes involved in proliferation controlwere significantly overrepresented. Transcripts related tocell cycle regulation and DNA replication were regulatedin a manner supporting cell cycle arrest. Genes, whoseproducts are involved in the transition from G1 to S-phaseappeared to be downregulated, such as cyclins (CCNA2,CCNE2, CCNF), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) andtranscription regulators (E2F2, PCNA, SKP2), whereastranscription of inhibitory genes cyclin G2 (CCNG2),GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible,alpha) and p21cip1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A,CDKN1A) was increased. Elevated levels of CCNG2, cyclinB1 interacting protein 1 (CCNB1IP1), forkhead box O3A(FOXO3A), GADD45A and p21cip1 genes as well as down-regulation of cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and CDK2 provided evi-dence that cell cycle progression might be additionallyarrested at the G2/M-checkpoint. The level of variousDNA replication related genes (CDC6, CDT1, FEN1,MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM7, MCM10, Pfs2,RFC3) was also reduced, thereby suggesting a reduction inthe replication rate. All cell cycle related effects are sum-marized in Figure 5, which shows a cell cycle diagramfrom GenMAPP (Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Pro-filer, Gladstone Institutes, University of San Francisco,San Francisco, CA) [38], in which up- and downregulatedgenes are marked.ApoptosisIn addition to the regulation of genes involved in prolifer-ation control, we also observed regulation of apoptosis-linked genes in a pro-apoptotic manner, indicating thatthe extract could sensitize breast cancer cells for apoptoticevents. An increase in apoptotic events would also con-tribute to the decrease in cellular proliferation observed.In cells treated with black cohosh the transcript of theapoptosis inhibitor survivin (baculoviral IAP repeat-con-taining 5, BIRC5) was downregulated, whereas genes cod-ing for apoptosis-inducing and -supporting products(BNIP3L, TNFRSF10B, TP53INP1) were increased.FOXO3A, GADD45A, GDF 15 (growth differentiation factor15) and p21cip1, whose mRNA levels increased, are alsoconnected with apoptosis in addition to their role in cellcycle control.

Downregulation of lymphoid-spe-cific helicase (HELLS), as observed in our experiments, hasbeen reported to be associated with apoptosis [40]. Theupregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1 = MAPK8)and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3 = CHOP =GADD153), as observed in our experiments, have beenreported as related to stress-induced apoptosis [41,42]. p8Protein (p8), immediate early response 3 (IER3) and DNA-damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4, also known asREDD1 or RTP801), whose transcript was strongly upreg-ulated, are known to be expressed under cellular stress(described later) and have been associated with both pro-and anti-apoptotic events [43-46].Stress responseIn relation to the results above, overexpression of tran-scripts involved with response to cellular stress was highlystatistically significant after treatment with black cohoshextract. Among different functional categories we identi-fied some 40 transcripts associated with metabolic stressresponse such as hypoxia [47], mal- or unfolded proteinresponse in the endoplasmic reticulum [48,49] or starva-tion for amino acids or glucose [50,51] (Figure 6).

Genes marked with grey boxes were downregulated.Page 11 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11script of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α; HIF1A), akey regulator in hypoxia, was upregulated. A heterodimerof HIF1α/ARNT (HIF1) binds to hypoxia-responsive ele-ments (HREs), thereby regulating the expression ofhypoxia-response genes. Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), basic helix-loop-helixdomain containing, class B, 2 (BHLHB2), p21cip1 and DDIT4– these transcripts were also upregulated – are known tobe direct target genes [47,52,53]. A hypoxia responsepathway via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)including inactivation of EIF4EBP1 (Eukaryotic transla-tion initiation factor 4E binding protein 1) and finallyresulting in increased mRNA translation is known to beinhibited by DDIT4 [52]. This could explain the increaseof EIF4EBP1 mRNA we observed in our experiment. Theincreases of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, beta(CEBPB), endothelial PAS domain protein 1(EPAS1=HIF2α), early growth response 1 (EGR1) and sestrin2 (SESN2) mRNA are also related to hypoxia [53,54].Furthermore, we observed regulation of genes related toendoplasmic reticulum stress response (unfolded proteinresponse, UPR), which involves the activation of three dif-ferent pathways. Transcription of c-Jun N-terminal kinase1 (JNK1 = MAPK8) was upregulated in our experiment.JNK1 is a target of one UPR-pathway and its activationmay lead to apoptosis [42,55].

Genes marked by boxes were regulated in MCF-7 cells after treatment with black cohosh extract. ↑ represents up-regulation, ↓ represents down-regulation. (Abbrevia-tions: ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; XBP1, x box binding protein 1; IRE1α, Serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribo-nuclease, Inositol-requiring 1).Page 12 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11Ser51 is involved not only in UPR but also in responses tohypoxia, nutrient deprivation and other cellular stresses.Hence, this evolutionarily conserved pathway has beentermed the integrated stress response (ISR) [41,52]. PERK(EIF2AK3, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alphakinase 3), whose mRNA-level was increased by blackcohosh treatment, is a kinase linking hypoxia stressreponse and UPR to eIF2α-phosphorylation, whereasamino acid and glucose starvation response acts via GCN2kinase. As a consequence of eIF2α-phosphorylation thetranslation of most mRNAs is inhibited, but paradoxicallythe translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) isincreased. We observed an upregulation of the ATF4 geneas well as various ATF4-induced downstream target genes,e.g. ASNS (asparagine synthetase), ATF3 (activating tran-scription factor 3), CHOP, GADD45A, HERPUD1 (homo-cysteine-inducible, endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible,ubiquitin-like domain member 1), HSPA5 (heat shock 70 kDaprotein 5). Gene products of these transcripts are involvedin cell survival and tumorigenesis as well as apoptoticevents [42,49,56].Protein turnoverIn the context of mis- or unfolded protein response someother processes of protein turnover are affected by blackcohosh extract. The expression levels of various ubiquitincycle-related genes (FBOX5, FBOX11, MAP1LC3B, SENP6,TBL1X, UBE2C, UBR1, Ufm1, USP3) were influenced byblack cohosh. Some of these transcripts code for productsinvolved with cell cycle progression and were regulated ina cell cycle arresting manner, emphasizing our resultsdescribed above. Inhibitory CCNB1IP1 was upregulated,whereas SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2; p45) andUHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING fingerdomains, 1) were downregulated. Furthermore, mRNA-levels of eight different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases(CARS, EPRS, GARS, IARS, MARS, SARS, WARS, YARS)were upregulated.OxidoreductasesIn response to black cohosh treatment, transcripts of sev-eral oxidoreductases involved with metabolism of xenobi-otics were affected. In some cases we observed stronginduction. The most prominent upregulation of all Cim-cifuga regulated genes occurred for CYP1A1 (cytochromeP450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1). In the microar-ray experiments the increase was 12.4 and 3.5 fold, whileRT-PCR gave even higher changes (28.5 ± 14.0 fold, p <0.01 and 19.2 ± 10.9 fold, p < 0.05). This was accompa-nied by a marked but lower increase of CYP1B1 (cyto-chrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1). Bothenzymes are known to be activated by xenobioticsthrough the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. Tran-script of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), an essentialenzyme in heme catabolism and a direct target of HIF1(see stress response), was also upregulated. Finally, tran-scripts of several enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthesispathway (CYP51A1, FDFT1, HMGCR, SC4MOL, SC5DL)were marginally increased.ReceptorsInterestingly, transcription of the aryl hydrocarbon recep-tor (AhR) which regulates expression of the CYPs, was alsoincreased. Furthermore, we observed a downregulation ofthe estrogen receptor α gene (ESR1). This regulation hasalready been reported in response to hypoxic stress [57].mRNAs coding for interferon gamma receptor 1(IFNGR1) appeared to be upregulated. The latter pro-motes effects of interferon γ, whose antitumor activity haspreviously been reported [58].OthersWithin this category, two tumor-associated transcriptsshowed largest upregulation. MALAT-1 (metastasis in lungadenocarcinoma transcript 1), a recently identified noncod-ing RNA, has been shown to be activated in early-stagelung cancer. High-level expression is associated to low sur-vival rates of patients due to high risk to develop metasta-tis [59]. S100P (S100 calcium binding protein P) wasreported as marker of breast cancer initiation. Expressionof S100P as well as FTH1 (Ferritin H), an iron-bindingprotein, whose transcript was also upregulated by blackcohosh, is associated to immortalization and transforma-tion of breast epithelial cells [60].Comparison of the expression pattern of black cohosh with tamoxifen and E2Expression profiles with 17β-estradiol and the estrogenreceptor-antagonist tamoxifen were investigated in paral-lel to compare the patterns with the black cohosh extract.After treatment with 1 nM E2 146 transcripts met ourselection criteria, among these known estrogen-regulatedgenes such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4(IGFBP4) or GREB1 protein (GREB1). The latter transcriptwas strongly upregulated (microarray: 21.7 and 10.4 fold;RT-PCR: 26.6 ± 10.1, p < 0.05 and 15.4 ± 5.7, p < 0.05).With 10 µM tamoxifen 49 genes were observed to be reg-ulated. Figure 7 shows the intersection of expression pat-terns of black cohosh, E2 and tamoxifen. Among a total of39 genes that were regulated both under black cohosh andE2 treatment, 30 transcripts were affected in oppositedirections (anti-correlated). In contrast, a comparison ofblack cohosh and tamoxifen revealed a correlated regula-tion of 32 transcripts. This is quite surprising given thatonly 49 genes were considered regulated in response totamoxifen. Hence, the expression profile of black cohoshwas more related to tamoxifen. Since E2 stimulated andtamoxifen inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 cells in ourassay, it was not surprising that most genes in the intersec-tions are related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

Apart from ESR1, which wasdownregulated with E2 and black cohosh treatment (Fig-ure 8), and VEGF, which can be considered to be regulatedvia hypoxia response pathways, no gene affected by blackcohosh is known to contain estrogen responsive elements(ERE) in the promoter region.Effects of actein and the cycloartane aglycon mixtureTo identify active principles in black cohosh, MCF-7 cellswere treated with the major cycloartane glycoside acteinand a mixture of cycloartenol aglycons under the sameconditions as in the microarray experiments, at concentra-tions corresponding to the IC50 values determined in theproliferation assay. We used real-time RT-PCR to deter-mine the expression levels vs. DMSO control of the 13genes selected on the basis of the microarray experiments:baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), cyclin E2(CCNE2), cyclin G2 (CCNG2), cytochrome P450 1A1(CYP1A1), cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, sub-family B, member 9 (DNAJB9), E2F transcription factor 2(E2F2), estrogen receptor α (ESR1), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha (GADD45A), metastasis associatedin lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT-1), proliferatingcell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF).

For the treatments with extract, tamoxifen and estradiol, results obtained with microarrays (Array) and real-time RT-PCR (PCR) are shown. For actein (ACT) and the aglycons (AGL) expression levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Bars represent gene expression levels as fold changes calculated versus DMSO control.

In general, treatment with acteinresulted in a slightly weaker regulation of the expressionlevels than treatment with the black cohosh extract.

In initial experiments analyzingcell proliferation we observed growth inhibition inresponse to treatment with a lipophilic extract of blackcohosh, the major cycloartane-type triterpene glycosideactein and a cycloartane aglycon mixture. IC50 values werecomparable to previously reported results [22-24].Effects of a black cohosh extract on gene expression inMCF-7 cells were determined by means of AffymetrixGeneChip® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, ena-bling almost complete analysis of the transcriptome. Aftertreatment of MCF-7 cells for 24 h with the black cohoshextract at the IC50 concentration (15 µg/ml) changes of theexpression levels of 431 genes were detected using highlystringent selection criteria. Random permutation of geneexpression profiles showed a mean of 22 to 32 regulatedprobe sets in our data set with our selection criteria indi-cating a false positive rate of about 5%.Comparing the expression patterns, action of blackcohosh is opposite to estradiol and more similar totamoxifen regarding proliferation and cell survival. How-ever, the effect of black cohosh treatment appears morecomplex, as significantly more genes were regulated thaneither with E2 or tamoxifen. The genes regulated by blackcohosh did not include well-known estrogen-regulatedgenes, with the exception of ESR1 (the estrogen recptor αgene) and VEGF which both could be regulated viahypoxia response. In contrast, a wider range of cellularpathways and targets were affected by black cohosh butnot E2 or tamoxifen. Hence, action of black cohosh inMCF-7 cells seems to be neither estrogenic nor antiestro-genic but rather multifacetted. Because MCF-7 is a modelfor determining estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects, wecan conclude that the benefical effects of black cohosh inalleviating postmenopausal complaints might be ratherdue to central nervous action via dopamine, serotonin orµ opioidic receptors.Among all regulated genes, those related to the functionalcategories of proliferation (cell cycle and DNA replication)and stress response (including members of different func-tional categories) were found to be highly significantlyoverrepresented, and these groups appear to be intercon-nected. Given that many genes were regulated at a lowerlevel and, therefore, excluded by the stringent filter set-ting, a statistically highly significant accumulation ofgenes in these functional categories emphasizes the signif-icance of our results.The cell cycle inhibition observed in the proliferationexperiments appears to be due to an arrest at both G1/S-and G2/M-transition points, as indicated by an accumula-tion of regulated genes. This finding is corroborated byrecent results of a flow cytometric analysis [24]. Severalgenes involved in apoptosis appeared to be regulated,most genes in a pro-apoptotic manner. Some genes arerelated to apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic events. Thesegenes are linked to different cellular stress response mech-anisms. Altogether, the expression levels of approxima-tively 40 genes related to stress response were affected byblack cohosh. Given the fact that results of stress responsepathways are contradictory, pro- and anti-apoptotic geneexpression may not be surprising. The main purpose ofstress response is an adaptation of the cells to stress fac-tors, resulting in cell survival, angiogenesis and promotedtumor growth. However, when stress reaches a certainthreshold, the protecting pathways become saturated andcells undergo apoptosis [49]. This may explain the seem-ingly contradictory effects observed in our experiment.Altogether, pro-apoptotic signalling seems to outweigh.Stress response regulation has already been previouslyreported for other xenobiotics such as the cancer chemo-protective phytochemical indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and itsphysiological condensation product diindolylmethane(DIM), whose antitumor activity has been widely investi-gated [42]. Its influence on gene expression in differenttumor cells – among others in breast cancer cells such asMCF-7 – shows a certain similarity to our results withblack cohosh. However, the mechanism of induced stressresponse by I3C is still unknown.In association with unfolded protein response varioustranscripts of protein turnover were affected by blackcohosh. Regulation of several transcripts whose productsare involved in ubiquitinylation may be due to aug-mented degradation of malformed proteins. IncreasedmRNA levels of not less than eight different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are not only linked to proteinsynthesis. Some ARSs are rather multifunctional proteinsinvolved in different cellular processes [61]. For example,the secretion of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) is linkedto apoptotic events [39] and tryptophanyl-tRNA syn-thetase (WARS) has been shown to possess angiostaticand proliferation-inhibitory activity [61].As response to exposure to black cohosh extract a group oftranscripts coding for enzymes with oxidoreductase activ-ity was upregulated ("response to xenobiotics"). A strongupregulation was observed for CYP1A1, and, to a some-what lesser extent, of CYP1B1. Apart from well-knowninvolvement in xenobiotic metabolism, thereby mediat-Page 16 of 19(page number not for citation purposes)BMC Pharmacology 2007, 7:11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/11ing toxic and tumorigenic effects of several chemicals,these two oxidoreductases are involved in the metabolismof 17β-estradiol [62]. CYP1A1 metabolizes E2 to non-car-cinogenic 2-hydroxy-E2 whereas CYP1B1 is responsiblefor the formation of carcinogenic 4-hydroxy-E2. The twoenzymes are not always expressed at the same level in tis-sues. An increased production of 2-hydroxy-E2 relative to4-hydroxy-E2, due to a higher expression level of CYP1A1than CYP1B1, has been suggested to be contributing tothe antitumor activity of indol-3-carbinol and, therefore,being of clinical importance [62]. As described, we alsoobserved significantly stronger induction of CYP1A1 tran-scripts than CYP1B1 with black cohosh treatment.CYP1A1 is known as the classical target of the aryl hydro-carbon receptor (AhR). Interestingly, the receptor has alsobeen upregulated with our experiment. The AhR, uponbinding of a ligand, forms a heterodimeric complex withARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator)which induces transactivation of the CYPs and other targetgenes via binding to xenobiotic response elements (XREs)in their promoter regions [63]. Classical AhR ligands and,therefore, CYP1A1 inducers are hydrophobic and planaror coplanar molecules of polycyclic structure. Althoughthe cycloartane-type triterpenoids do not satisfy thesestructural requirements, gene expression of CYP1A1 wasnot only induced in our experiments by black cohoshextract but also by the cycloartane aglycons (5.0 ± 1.7 fold,p < 0.01 and 12.2 ± 3.4 fold, p < 0.01) and, to a lower butstatistically significant extent, by actein (2.1 ± 0.8, p < 0.05and 2.0 ± 0.2, p < 0.01). CYP1B1 was also differentiallyexpressed by the triterpenoids. The upregulation ofCYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression by extract and purifiedcycloartanes cannot be explained by AhR binding. Indeed,black cohosh extract and compounds did not show anyAhR activity in a reporter gene assay [64] in rat hepatomaH4IIE cells [see Additional file 2]. These findings are incontradiction with previous experiments showing weakAhR binding and transactivation activity of black cohoshextracts. However, these experiments were carried outwith high concentrations (up to 200 µg/ml) and did notinclude single compounds [20,21]. The upregulation ofCYP1A1 and CYP1B1 may be linked to activation of genesinvolved with hypoxic stress response, although the con-sequences of upregulated stress response appear some-what contradictory. AhR and hypoxia-induced signaltransduction are connected via ARNT, and AhR andHIF1α compete in binding to ARNT. Hypoxic conditionsreportedly inhibited AhR-dependent gene expression[65], on the other hand, a connection between CYP1A1induction and hypoxia-induced gene regulation in Caco2cells has been found [66].Besides CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, 11 other selected mRNAsrepresenting all regulated functional categories wereinvestigated by real-time RT-PCR to verify the microarrayresults and to investigate the effects of the cycloartane-type triterpenoids. Briefly, all genes were regulated by thetriterpenoids in the same direction and to a fairly compa-rable extent than with the extract. Hence, we provide herefirst evidence that cycloartane glycosides as well as theiraglycons, which are most likely formed in the intestineprior to absorption, are putative active principles in blackcohosh.ConclusionIn conclusion, the microarray investigation on blackcohosh in MCF-7 breast cancer cells revealed several newinteresting aspects. Gene expression "contra cell prolifera-tion" and "pro apoptosis" emphasizes previously reportedactions of black cohosh. These effects might be a result ofstress response to hypoxic conditions, protein distur-bances and induction of oxidoreductases, evoked by anexposure to black cohosh extract. Regulation of othergenes, eg. induction of CYP1A1, IFNGR1 and WARS anddownregulation of ERα mRNA (ESR1) might contributeto a putative antitumor activity of black cohosh. On theother hand, activation of genes involved in cell survival,angiogenesis and tumor progression, such as VEGF,S100P, MALAT-1 and different stress response genes,raises questions. Since black cohosh is increasingly popu-lar as an alternative to HRT, a thorough benefit/risk assess-ment is required. Black cohosh preparations have beenconsidered as safe up to now and no serious adverse reac-tions have been reported so far. Nonetheless, furtherinvestigations are needed to assess the safety level and toanalyze putative antitumor applications with functionalassays and in vivo models.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that there are no competing inter-ests.Authors' contributionsMH and SW conceived the study and supervised its per-formance.
