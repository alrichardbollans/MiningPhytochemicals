Antioxidant capacity of abietanes from Sphacele salviaeEscuder, B.Torres, R.Lissi, E.Labbé, C.Faini, F.Carnosol 1, rosmanol 2, carnosic acid 3 and 20-deoxocarnosol 4, the main phenolic abietanespresent in aerial parts of the Chilean medicinal plant Sphacele salviae were tested for antioxidantactivity of measuring the decay of the radical cation diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). All compoundsdisplayed higher antioxidant levels than BHT under the same conditions and carnosic acid was moreefficient than vitamin E.
