Abstract
The hepatotoxicity of some Chinese herbs has been a cause for concern in recent years. However, some herbs, such as
rhubarb, have been documented as having both therapeutic and toxic effects on the liver, leading to the complex problem
of distinguishing the benefits from the risks of using this herb. To comparatively analyze the dose-response relationship
between rhubarb and hepatic health, we administrated total rhubarb extract(RE) to normal and carbon tetrachloride(CCl4)-
treated rats for 12 weeks at 4 dosage levels(2.00, 5.40, 14.69 and 40.00 g?kg
21, measured as the quantity of crude material),
followed by biochemical and histopathological tests of the rats’ livers. A composite pattern was extracted by factor analysis,
using all the biochemical indices as variables, into a visual representation of two mathematically obtained factors, which
could be interpreted as the fibrosis factor and the cellular injury factor, according to the values of the variable loadings. The
curative effect of administering the two lowest dosages of RE to CCl4-treated rats was mainly expressed as a decrease in the
extent of cellular injury. The hepatoprotective mechanism of RE might be related to its antioxidant effect, the antagonism of
the free radical damage to hepatocytes caused by CCl4. By contrast, the RE-induced liver damage was mainly expressed as a
significant increase in the amount of fibrosis in both normal rats at all dosage levels and CCl4-treated rats at the two highest
dosage levels. Therefore, the hepatotoxic potential of RE could be attributable to the liver cell fibrosis induced by high
doses of the herb. This study illustrates the bidirectional potential of rhubarb and demonstrates the feasibility of using
factor analysis to study the dose-response relationships between herbal medicines and hepatotoxicity or the healing effects
of these herbs by extracting the underlying interrelationships among a number of functional bio-indices in a holistic
manner.

Introduction
Traditional Chinese herbal medicines are used worldwide, but
there are a number of concerns regarding their use. Some
researchers believe that herbal medicines are effective and safe,
while others doubt their effectiveness and safety. The latter group
has increased in number, especially after consecutive reports of
adverse hepatotoxic effects of a number of phytomedicines,
including Polygonum multiflorum [1], Shou-Wu Pian [2], Xiao-
Chai-Hu-Tang (Syo-saiko-to), [3] and some herbs containing
anthraquinones, such as Sennae fructus angustifoliae [4] and Rheum
palmatum L. (rhubarb) [5]. Chitturi et al. believe that herbal
hepatotoxicity is an expanding but poorly defined problem [6].
These herbal medicines, especially rhubarb and its constituent
components, are frequently used as treatments for chronic liver
diseases and as laxatives in Asian countries, and a number of cases
have demonstrated their affirmative effectiveness and safety [7,8].
In addition to the clinical evidence of the effectiveness of rhubarb
in treating chronic hepatic diseases, [9,10] many experiments at
the animal, cellular and molecular levels have revealed that
rhubarb and its anthraquinone constituents exert a protective
effect against hepatic injury by inhibiting the carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4)-induced elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hyaluronic acid (HA)
and laminin (LN) levels. [11,12]
In vitro and in vivo studies focusing on the anthraquinone
constituents of rhubarb, however, have revealed conflicting results.
A two-year National Toxicology Program (NTP) study, conducted
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
on emodin, one of the main anthraquinone derivatives contained
within rhubarb, demonstrated the hepatotoxic potential of emodin
on normal rats and mice. The toxic effects included elevations of
ALT levels, total bile acids (TBIL) levels and organ-weight-to-
body-weight ratios (relative weights) of the liver, as well as
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e24498decreases in alkaline phosphatase (AP) and total protein levels
(TP). [13] Other investigators have reported that administration of
rhubarb extracts (REs) led to elevations of serum ALT and TBIL
levels in patients and experimental animals, leading to hepatitis
and nephritis. [14–17]
The conflicting results of these reports might be due to the
heterogeneity and complexity of herbal medicines with respect to
their geographic origin, harvest season, and discrepancy of
constituent components. Herbal medicines, which usually contain
hundreds of chemical components with broad pharmacological
targets and effects, present difficulties in describing overall
biological profiles in a simple manner with a few essential factors
that can be readily comprehended. Many phytopharmacologists
have dedicated themselves to solving this provlem for decades. In
recent years, pattern recognition, [18] a type of multivariate
analysis approach, has become a promising method for identifying
and interpreting meaningful regularities in noisy or complex
systems, by analyzing data from different perspectives and
summarizing them as useful information or by mining potential
interrelationships. The factor analysis used in this study is a
common pattern recognition method that reduces a large number
of disease parameters to a relatively small number of independent
factors, by describing the covariance structure of the observed data
variables in terms of a few underlying and independent but non-
measurable features called ‘‘factors’’. [19]
The aim of this study was to determine the paradoxical effects of
liver protection and hepatotoxicity of rhubarb in the treatment of
rat experimental hepatitis induced by carbon tetrachloride by
categorizing a number of functional bio-indices into separate
complementary domains (protection or toxicity) with no a priori
assumptions. We believe that our data will provide useful
information for the safe evaluation and proper application of
rhubarb and, furthermore, will help increase our understanding of
the rational use of phytomedicines.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was conducted in strict accordance with the
recommendations of the Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of
China. The animal protocol was approved by the Committee on
the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the 302 Military Hospital
(Approval ID: 09-056).
Animals and reagents
Male and female Sprague- Dawley rats, aged 6-8 weeks and
weighing 180 6 30 g, were obtained from the Laboratory Animal
Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (License No.
SYXK 2007- 004). The animals were raised separately by gender
and had unlimited access to food and water in an environmentally
controlled breeding room (temperature 2262uC, humidity 60–
80%). The breeding room was illuminated by an artificial light
cycle with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness every day
and was disinfected regularly.
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was purchased from Beijing Beihua
Fine Chemicals Co. Ltd (Cat. #20060525), and olive oil was
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co. Ltd
(Cat. #F20080219). Both reagents were of AR grade.
Herb extraction and UPLC-MS/MS analysis
Rhubarb is the peeled and dried root of Rheum palmatum L., R.
tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. or R. officinale Baill. (Polygonaceae
family), as stipulated in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia[20]. Rhubarb
is also officially listed in European and Japanese pharmacopoeias.
[21,22] R. palmatum was used in this study because it is described in
all three pharmacopoeias and is more commonly used than the
other species. The dried root and rhizome of R. palmatum L. were
collected in Lixian County of the Gansu Province of China and
were identified by Professor Xiao-he Xiao, a taxonomist at the
Military Institute of Chinese Materia Medica. In total, 100 kg
rhubarb was added to 600 L of 90% ethanol and then heated and
extracted 3 times for 1 hour each time. The residual compounds
after extraction were added to 1000 L of water and then heated
and extracted for 1 hour. The filtrate was merged and sprayed dry,
producing a yield of 29.3%. The samples were preserved for
further experiments.
Rhubarb extract (RE) was analyzed for quality control by ultra-
performance liquid chromatography coupled with an ultraviolet-
visible detector and electrospray ionization tandem mass spec-
trometry (UPLC-UV-ESI-MS/MS). [23] The experimental con-
ditions and data are provided in Text S1.
Animal model and study groups
In this study, a CCl4-induced liver injury model was used
because it has been well documented and demonstrated to have
good repeatability and reliability. One experiment cycle continued
for 16 weeks, and the following procedure was used immediately
prior to the experiment, 180 rats were randomized into 10 groups
of 18 animals each, with equal distributions by gender. The groups
shown in Tables 1 and 2 were differentiated based on the
treatment group and extract dosage. The rats in the five model
groups (groups M and M1-M4) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with CCl4 oil (containing 1 portion CCl4 and 9 portions olive oil,
5 ml/kg) 2 times per week for 12 weeks to induce chronic liver
injury, and the rats in the other groups received normal saline
(N.S.). The rats in all medication groups (groups N1-N4 and M1-
M4) were administered RE intragastrically once per day from the
4
th week until the end of the 16
th week. Rats in the control (group
N) and model (group M) groups were administered normal saline
intragastrically. The RE dosages were 2.00, 5.40, 14.69 and
40.00 g/kg (measured as the quantity of crude material) per kg of
body weight once per day and were equivalent to between 4 and
80 times the human upper dosage limit stipulated in the Chinese
Pharmacopoeia (0.5 g/kg). Food and water were available ad
libitum for all rats throughout the experiment.
Histopathologic examination and biochemical analysis
Necropsies were performed on all the animals at the end of the
experiment. Tissues for histopathologic examination were fixed
and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and
trimmed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to a thickness of
approximately 5mm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).
Biochemical analyses were performed on all animals. The
biochemical parameters of serum ALT, AST, AP, urea nitrogen
(SUN), creatinine (CREA), TP, albumin (ALB), globulin (GLO),
calcium, inorganic phosphate, total cholesterol (CHOL) and TBIL
levels were measured by the Clinical Laboratory of 302 Military
Hospital of China. The levels of HA, LN and transforming growth
factor b1 (TGF-b1) in rat serum were quantitated by chemilumi-
nescence using assay kits from Beijing Deyuan Biomedical
Engineering Corporation, China.
Statistical analysis
The experimental values were expressed as means 6 standard
deviation (means 6 SD). All data were analyzed using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows, version
13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The groups were compared
Pattern Recognition for Herbal Toxicity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 September 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e24498using ANOVA and multivariate statistical analysis, and the
significance probability was set at P=0.05.
The factor analysis model was as follows:
yc~lc1F1zlc2F2zlc3F3z:::zlcnFnzec
where yc is the cth original variable, c=1,...,p, p is the number
of original variables, lc1, lc2, lc3,...,lcn are the factor loadings, F1,
F2, F3,...,Fn are the (new) factors, n is the number of factors,
and ec the error term related to yc. [24] The correlation
coefficients were analyzed by principal component analysis and
subsequent rotation according to the standard varimax criterion.
The correlation between parameters was attributed to their
common dependence on independent entities called ‘‘factors.’’
The coefficients that linked the parameters to factors were named
‘‘factor loadings’’.
Results
Study design
This study included two parts. First, a comparative experiment
was designed to investigate the dose-responses of RE to normal
and CCl4-treated rats. Standard blood chemistry analyses were
used to evaluate liver damage and histological changes were
assessed. All doses were set at high levels to uncover potential
toxicities to rigorously investigate the hepatic risks of RE.

ically illustrate the bidirectional effect of liver protection and
hepatotoxicity of RE on subjects under different physiological
conditions. The mathematical modeling process used a dimension
reduction effect to convert the original dataset of numerous disease
variables into a relatively small number of independent ‘‘factors’’
that are not measurable but are easy to comprehend, including the
protection factor and the lesion factor.
Identification of the chemical constituents in rhubarb
extract (RE)
In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the major
components contained in RE are anthraquinone derivatives and
tannin-related compounds. [25] Using liquid chromatography
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, seventeen compounds
were identified in this study, and their structures were tentatively
assigned as twelve anthraquinone derivatives and five tannin-
related compounds. The identified chemical constituents (Table
S1) and the contents of the index compounds in the RE (Table S2)
are summarized in the supplementary materials to illustrate the
chemical basis of the RE utilized in this study. The chemical
structures of the identified constituents in RE are depicted in
Figures S1 and S2. The chromatographic profile is depicted in
Fig. 1.
Common changes
All the RE-treated rats had a dose-related fur color change
patterns, ranging from yellow to red, that appeared early in the
study with exposure to increasing concentrations of RE. Red-to-
brown urine and reddish-brown staining of the anal area were also
noted for all rats that were treated with RE. Marked and chronic
diarrhea accompanied by emaciation and inactivity were observed
in all model and normal rats that were treated with 40 g/kg, but
not the lower doses, of RE. During RE administration, the rats in
the CCl4-treated groups had lower increases in weight than those
in the normal groups at the same dosage. Rats in all the RE-
administered groups had negative dose-related body weight
changes, and the rats in the highest dosage group had the lowest
increase in weight until cessation of RE administration.
Histopathology
Dosage-dependent vacuolar degeneration of the hepatic portal
area and/or hyperplasia of interstitial fibrous tissue were observed
in over 67% of animals in the ND1-ND4 groups.
In the control group (group N), all rats exhibited normal
histology. By contrast, 16 out of 18 animals in the model group
(group M) exhibited vacuolar degeneration, which was character-
ized by small or medium vacuole formation in hepatocytes
accompanied by nuclear loss or dislocation to the margins of the
vacuoles. Hepatocytes with large nuclei were occasionally
observed. Small focal lymphocytic infiltration of the stroma and/
or portal area was also observed in 12 out of 18 animals in group
M. Moreover, an obviously thickened envelope and fibrosis of the
portal area and/or stroma were observed in 11 out of 18 animals
in group M. The animals in groups MD1-MD4 showed decreases
in vacuolar degeneration and lymphocytic infiltration in hepato-
cytes with increasing RE dosages. Over 67% of the animals in
both groups MD1 and MD2 exhibited notably alleviated fibrosis of
the liver envelope, portal area, and/or stroma, whereas 67% of the
animals in the MD3 group and 88% of the animals in the MD4
group exhibited obvious aggravation of fibrosis. Typical histo-
pathologic changes are depicted in Fig. 2.
Biochemical indices
The biochemical indices that changed significantly in the study
groups are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
In the control group (N) and RE-treated normal rat groups
(ND1-ND4), the indices exhibited overall dose-dependent increas-
ing trends (Table 1). Compared to the group N, serum ALT and
HA values increased significantly in the ND2,N D 3 and ND4
groups (P,0.05) and AST, LN and TGF-b1 values increased
significantly in the ND3 and ND4 groups (P,0.05), whereas TBIL
values increased significantly in the ND4 group only (P,0.05).
The serum ALT and AST values of all RE-treated model
groups (MD1-MD4) were significantly lower than those of group M
without treatment (P,0.05). However, these two indices stopped
declining and started to increase when the dosage increased from
the second dosage (MD2, 5.40 g/kg) to the third (MD3, 14.69 g/
kg). Regarding the TBIL, HA, LN and TGF-b1 levels, the values

18) are unknown compounds.

than those of group M without treatment (P,0.05) (Table 2).
Factor analysis using biochemical indices as variables
Bartlett’s test of sphericity indicated a correlation between the
currently used variables because the correlation matrix was
significantly different from the identity matrix (P,0.01). The
KMO measure of sampling adequacy was 0.789, which was higher
than the acceptable criterion of 0.5. [26] The eigenvalues of the 9
factors are depicted in a scree plot in Fig. 3. Several methods were
used to determine the number of meaningful factors that should be
extracted. As a general rule, factors with an eigenvalue greater
than 1.0 are retained. [27] The rationale for this rule is that the
amount of variance accounted for by each factor should be at least
equal to the variance of one variable. [24] This criterion indicated
that two factors should be extracted in the present study. The first

was improved after treatment with rhubarb extract in groups MD1–MD4. Notably, alleviation of fibrosis of the liver envelope, portal area, and/or
stroma was observed in the animals in the MD1 and MD2 groups, whereas aggravation of fibrosis was found in over 67% of animals in the MD3 and

total variability, respectively. These two primary factors could
explain 70.840% of the total variability in the dataset. The results
of the factor analysis and a suggested interpretation are shown in
Table 3. In interpreting the retained factors, we only selected
variables with loadings above 0.5 or below -0.5 (i.e., variables with
high influence).[28] According to this criterion, factor 1 could be
labeled as ‘‘fibrosis’’ because the selected biochemical variables
including HA, LN and TGF-b1 (all loadings .0.85) are related to
the fibrotic course[29-31] and factor 2 could be labeled as ‘‘cellular
injury’’ because it was mainly affected by ALT and AST (both
loadings .0.90), which were altered when the hepatocellular
membrane was damaged.
The graphical representation of the dose-response relationship
of RE, using these two statistically obtained factors as the axes to
show the distribution pattern of different study groups in the plot,
is depicted in Fig. 4. In the graphical representation, the toxicity-
and pharmacologically induced variation patterns of the biochem-
ical indices could be deduced from the ordered distribution of the
studied groups. The untreated N group and the untreated M
group are represented at the left lower side and upper right side of
the diagram, respectively. The distance of group M away from
group N illustrated certain hepatotoxic effects of both enzyme
variations and fibrosis in rats with CCl4-induced hepatitis
compared to normal animals. The values of the fibrosis factor of
the normal rat groups increased in all dosage groups (ND1-ND4,
dosages from 2.00 to 40 g/kg), whereas their values of the cellular
injury factor did not significantly increase. In the model rat groups,
the values of the cellular injury factor of the first (MD1, 2.00 g/kg)
and second (MD2, 5.40 g/kg) dosage groups decreased compared
to the value of the untreated model group (M), whereas the values
decreased by a smaller degree when the dosage was further
increased. Although the values of the fibrosis factor of the MD1
and MD2 groups decreased slightly compared to the value of the
M group, the values of the MD3 (14.69 g/kg) and MD4 (40.00 g/
kg) groups shifted to an increasing trend with increasing dosage.
Discussion
It has been previously reported that the protective effect of
rhubarb against CCl4-induced liver lesions was largely attributed to
the inhibition of the generation of free radicals and antioxidant
activity. [32,33] The mechanism of CCl4-induced liver injury is
generally interpreted as follows: the compound is bioactivated by
cytochrome P450 2E1 to the trichloromethyl free radical (NCCl3)
and then further converted to a peroxy radical (CCl3O2N), which
leads to a chain reaction auto-oxidation of the fatty acids in the
cytoplasmic membrane phospholipids causing functional and
morphological changes to the cell membrane. [34] As a conse-
quence, the cell membranes of hepatocytes become more
permeable, and enzymes such as ALT and AST can leak out into
the bloodstream, leading to increased levels of these enzymes in the
blood. These increases reflect the degree of hepatocyte damage and
necrosis [35] and vice versa. Therefore, it could be inferred that the
pharmacological activity of rhubarb in treating liver injury is
strongly related to its antioxidant effects via the protection of

Figure 4. Dose-response relationships of rhubarb extract to
both normal and model rats, as represented by a factor plot.
The alteration pattern of the dose-response relationship between
rhubarb extract and hepatic health in normal rats showed an almost
linear variation: factor 1, considered in relation to fibrosis and called the
‘‘fibrosis factor’’, showed a notable increasing trend with increasing of
dosage levels (ND1-ND4, dosages of 2.00, 5.40, 14.69 and 40.00 g kg
21,
respectively), whereas factor 2, considered in relation to cell membrane
integrality and called the ‘‘cellular injury factor’’, revealed a nonsignif-
icant increase. By contrast, the alteration pattern in the model rat
groups assumed a parabolic shape with increasing dosages. The factor
1 values decreased in the MD1 and MD2 groups but decreased to a
small degree when the dosage was further increased. The factor 2
values decreased slightly in the MD1 and MD2 groups and then shifted
to a significant increasing trend with increasing dosages in the MD3 and
MD4 groups. The center points of the different groups are labeled as
follows: untreated normal rats group (N, & green square); normal rat
groups treated with rhubarb extract at different dosages (ND1-ND4, X)
(symbol size indicates dosage); untreated model rat group (M,N); and
model rat groups treated with rhubarb extract at different dosages
(MD1-MD4, m blue triangle) (symbol size indicates dosage). The border
lines around the center points are presented for the range of original
data points of the studied groups.

Pattern Recognition for Herbal Toxicity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 September 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e24498hepatic cells against free radical damage. This outcome manifested
as a decrease in the cellular injury factor, (shown in Fig. 4), which
was closely correlated with biomarkers such as ALT and AST
(shown in Table 2).
The anti-oxidative effects [36] of rhubarb anthraquinone
derivatives, along with their hepatoprotective effects, [11] have
been reported. In addition, a series of tannin-related compounds
with strong antioxidant effects have been identified in RE (see
Supplementary Materials). In a previous report, the antioxidant
activities of rhubarb tannins were verified. [37] Therefore, we
believe that rhubarb tannins and anthraquinone derivatives may
all contribute to the hepatoprotective effects of rhubarb against
CCl4-induced liver damage.
The hepatoprotective effect of rhubarb and its components has
also been documented as antagonizing a-naphthylisothiocyanate
(ANIT)-[38] and concanavalin A [39]- induced experimental liver
injury. In a previous study, we found that free anthraquinones
extracted from rhubarb, such as rhein and emodin, exhibited
protective activity against ANIT-induced cholestatic liver injury by
reducing the serum levels of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase,
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and the serum total bilirubin,
direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, c-glutamyltransferase and
total bile acids. These effects were markedly different from the
effects on CCl4-induced liver injury. The morphological alter-
ations induced by ANIT in rats, including the necrosis of
hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, as well as neutrophil
infiltration and sinusoid congestion, were also alleviated by
concurrent intragastric administration of these free anthraqui-
nones. [8] Some clinical evidence has also revealed a hepatopro-
tective effect of rhubarb against infantile cholestatic hepatitis[40]
and acute icteric hepatitis [41]. The protective effect against CCl4-
induced liver damage reported in this study demonstrated only
one aspect of the pharmacological potential of rhubarb to protect
the liver. Although there is some evidence of the protective
potential of this herb against liver injury due to multiple causes, the
molecular mechanisms of this protection remain unclear. Rigorous
clinical studies and in-depth experimental studies are needed to
demonstrate rhubarb’s hepatoprotective effects and mechanisms of
action.
In our study, dose-dependent alterations of liver fibrosis
associated with increases in the fibrosis factor were clearly
observed in the rats in the normal groups (Figs 2 and 4).
Although the occurrence of fibrosis of the liver tissues of normal
rats that were treated with rhubarb has been reported
infrequently, this phenomenon warrants further consideration.
Elevation of TBIL, TP and GLO levels in serum have also been
found in normal rat groups. These alterations usually occur along
with hepatic impairment, indicating functional deterioration of
the liver. Although the hepatoprotective effects of anthraquinone
derivatives are well documented, it has also been reported that
the total anthraquinone derivatives isolated from rhubarb show
some hepatotoxic potential in rats in a six month-long
experiment. [14] Therefore, the dose-response relationship
between rhubarb anthraquinones and liver health warrants
further investigation.
The alteration pattern of the fibrosis factor in the model rat
groups assumed a parabolic shape with increasing dosages of RE
(shown in Fig. 4). At lower dosages (MD1, 2.00 g/kg and MD2,
5.40 g/kg), rhubarb demonstrated some ameliorative effects on
liver injury by decreasing the fibrosis caused by CCl4; however, the
fibrosis was aggravated rather than alleviated when the dosage was
increased further (MD3, 14.69 g/kg and MD4, 40.00 g/kg).
Therefore, we believe that the hepatotoxic potential of rhubarb
is strongly related to liver fibrosis, although this effect is
undetectable when the normal dosage recommended in the
Chinese Pharmacopoeia (0.5 g/kg) is administered. [20]
The results of the factor analysis of biochemical indices
indicated that the parallel histopathological changes arose
coincidently. The vacuolar degeneration, and lymphocyte infiltra-
tion and fibrosis observed in the hepatocytes of CCl4-treated rats
were alleviated after treatment with RE, demonstrating the herb’s
effectiveness in protecting hepatocytes from the toxicant. Howev-
er, the anti-fibrotic effect of RE that was observed in the lower
dosage groups was reversed with further increases in the RE
dosage. The dose-dependent hyperplasia of interstitial fibrous
tissue was also observed in liver tissue sections from normal rats
that were treated with RE, which was in accordance with the
variations in the fibrosis factor.
A classical description of the understanding of such bidirec-
tional effects of rhubarb and other herbal medicines, You Gu Wu
Yun, was recorded in the Chinese Medical Treatise Su Wen
(translated as Plain Questions,p a r to fThe Yellow Emperor’s Classic of
Internal Medicine), which was written 2,500 years ago.[42] The
archaic and recondite wording of Y o uG uW uY u ncan be
explained as follows. A drug will reveal its therapeutic effect when
it is prescribed to patients with the correct indications; however, it
may produce deleterious effects in both sick and healthy people as
a result of incorrect indications. Another translation of the
wording implies that the dosage of the drug is critical to its
rational application in the clinic to balance the benefits and risks.
Ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has effectively
relied on the theory of Y o uG uW uY u nas an important set of
guidelines in the treatment of diseases and disorders. The dose-
related bidirectional effect of TCM illustrated in this study
supports the aforementioned theory. The pattern recognition
approach proposed in this report opens an avenue to decode the
ancient TCM theory and to elucidate its medical implications
with the use of modern biochemical tools.
In conclusion, the findings of this study illustrate the
bidirectional potential, both liver protection and hepatotoxicity,
of rhubarb on CCl4-treated and normal rats and demonstrate the
feasibility of using a multivariate analysis approach factor analysis,
to study the dose-response (therapeutic efficacy versus toxicity)
relationships of traditional herbal medicines by revealing the
underlying interrelationships within a number of functional bio-
indices in a holistic manner. This study provides a paradigm for a
better understanding and scientific assessment of the benefits and
risks of herbal medicines to facilitate the rational clinical
administration of these medicines.
