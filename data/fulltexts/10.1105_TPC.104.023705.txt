The first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL), is encoded by four genes in Arabidopsis
thaliana. Whereas PAL function is well established in various plants, an insight into the functional significance of individual
gene family members is lacking. We show that in the absence of clear phenotypic alterations in the Arabidopsis pal1 and
pal2 single mutants and with limited phenotypic alterations in the pal1 pal2 double mutant, significant modifications occur in
the transcriptome and metabolome of the pal mutants. The disruption of PAL led to transcriptomic adaptation of
components of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, revealing
complex interactions at the level of gene expression between these pathways. Corresponding biochemical changes
included a decrease in the three major flavonol glycosides, glycosylated vanillic acid, scopolin, and two novel feruloyl
malates coupled to coniferyl alcohol. Moreover, Phe overaccumulated in the double mutant, and the levels of many other
amino acids were significantly imbalanced. The lignin content was significantly reduced, and the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio of
lignin monomers had increased. Together, from the molecular phenotype, common and specific functions of PAL1 and PAL2
are delineated, and PAL1 is qualified as being more important for the generation of phenylpropanoids.
INTRODUCTION
The phenylpropanoid compounds derived from the shikimic acid
pathway are precursors to diverse classes of phenolics, such as
lignin, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, coumarins, and stilbenes. One
of the intriguing characteristics of phenylpropanoids is the rapid
modification in fluxes and rates of their synthesis and metabo-
lism. This aspect is corroborated by the occurrence of specific
phenolics in certain cell types, in response to specific stimuli
(light, pathogens, and wounding) or during particular develop-
mental stages.
The end products of the shikimate pathway, the aromatic
amino acids Phe, Trp, and Tyr, are generated from the precursors
phospho-enol-pyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate. Phe am-
monia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), the first enzyme of the phenyl-
propanoid pathway, removes Phe from aromatic amino acid
biosynthesis to generate trans-cinnamic acid and NH3 in a non-
oxidative deamination. Therefore, PAL commits the flux of
primary metabolites into the phenylpropanoid pathway and
becomes rate limiting when reduced below a threshold of 20 to
25% in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) (Bate et al., 1994; Sewalt
et al., 1997). Many studies have revealed the regulatory mech-
anisms for various PAL isoforms in response to different stimuli.
PAL activity is mainly regulated via de novo synthesis of the
enzyme, but it can also be modulated by inactivation of the
protein. PAL transcript levels increase when furnished with its
substrate Phe as, among others, evidenced through feeding
studies in lignifying Pinus taeda cells (Anterola et al., 2002). PAL
activity and PAL gene transcription are inhibited by trans-
cinnamic acid, its product (Bolwell et al., 1986; Mavandad et al.,
1990; Blount et al., 2000). Moreover, PAL is subject to post-
translational phosphorylation by a specific calcium-dependent
protein kinase (Cheng et al., 2001).
Given that alterations in the expression of monolignol bio-
synthesis genes can lead to differential accumulation of pathway
intermediates that, in turn, can affect the transcription of other

genes (Boerjan et al., 2003), we hypothesize that it would be
possible to reveal the full spectrum of the PAL function and to
dissect functional redundancy of PAL isoforms by means of
thorough molecular phenotyping. We have recently identified the
34Arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode the 10 known enzyme
functions in monolignol biosynthesis (Raes et al., 2003). The
Arabidopsis genome harbors four PAL genes that fall into two
phylogenetic groups consisting of PAL1 and PAL2, and PAL3
and PAL4. On the basis of their strong expression in the
inflorescence stem, phylogenetic relationship, and occurrence
of promoter elements, PAL1 and PAL2 were selected as good
candidates for monolignol production during developmental
lignification of vascular tissues (Raes et al., 2003).
Here, we show that in the absence of phenotypic alterations in
the pal1 and pal2 single mutants and with limited phenotypic
alterations in the pal1 pal2 double mutant, significant modifica-
tions occur at the transcriptome and metabolome levels in these
mutants. Transcript-profiling approaches reveal far-reaching
consequences of the disruption of the PAL function on the
transcription of genes that encode enzymes of the phenylpro-
panoid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolisms, establish-
ing a clear link between primary and secondary metabolisms.
Furthermore, many of these alterations at the transcriptional level
are translated into the corresponding biochemical effects as
witnessed by targeted metabolite profiling. Our data indicate
common as well as discrete functions of PAL1 and PAL2 and
demonstrate that a single mutation can profoundly affect the
transcription of a plethora of genes, also outside the phenyl-
propanoid pathway, and the biosynthesis of a variety of metab-
olites.
RESULTS
Morphological Characterization of the pal1, pal2,
and pal1 pal2Mutants
T-DNA insertion mutants for PAL1 and PAL2 were generated
by exon-trap mutagenesis in the Arabidopsis ecotype C24
(Babiychuk et al., 1997; see Methods). T-DNA insertions resided
in the first intron of both genes (data not shown).
Although flavonoid deficiency is known to influence several
aspects of plant development, such as lateral root formation,
inflorescence growth, and seed viability, the pal1 and pal2 exon-
trap mutants had no visible phenotypic alterations. The pal1 pal2
double mutant exhibited no gross morphological differences
either, except that it had become sterile. As shown in Figure 1,
the siliques remained small (3 to 4 mm versus;12 mm in the wild
type). The empty ovule sacs had initially enlarged but shriveled
later, suggesting male sterility. Reduced pollen viability was also
observed in transgenic tobacco downregulated for PAL (Elkind
et al., 1990). Because of the failure to produce viable seeds, the
double mutant generated recurrent flushes of accessory para-
clades that also failed to produce seeds. These flushes contin-
ued long after the wild type and single mutants had ceased
growth.
Although no growth differences could be seen with respect to
time of bolting, height, or diameter of the inflorescence stem,
slight differences in lignin accumulation were observed by lignin
histochemistry in inflorescence stems of 2.5-month-old plants.
As shown in Figure 1, a small reduction in lignin deposition was
detected in the pal1 mutant and a more significant reduction in
the pal1 pal2 double mutant (Figures 1A to 1L). Cell walls were
further investigated at the ultrastructural level by transmission
electron microscopy, as presented in Figure 2. The cell walls
of xylem and interfascicular fibers were evenly thickened and
uniformly stained in the wild type (Figures 2A and 2E). Double
mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type in terms of cell
size, cell number, or thickness of the cell wall. However, the cell
wall of the interfascicular fibers and the large vessels appeared
unevenly stained, and cell corners were often whiter (Figures 2B
and 2F). In several cells, various signs of a reduced cell wall
strength were observed: layers of the cell wall were loosened and
had numerous little holes, or cellulose microfibrils became
apparent (Figures 2C, 2D, 2G, and 2H). The latter phenomena
were never observed in the wild type. At a low frequency, cell
walls of the double mutant were aberrantly shaped and irregular
(Figure 2B), similar to what has been observed in a more dramatic
way in the lignin-deficient irregular xylem 4 Arabidopsis mutants
(Jones et al., 2001).
In conclusion, pal1 and pal2 mutants have no obvious visible
phenotype. Only the combination of both mutations in the double
mutant leads to infertility and clear changes in lignin accumula-
tion and secondary cell wall ultrastructure.
Expression of the Four Arabidopsis PALGenes Is
Altered in the Mutants
One possibility to explain the limited phenotypic differences in
the pal single and double mutants is that the disruption of the
PAL1 and PAL2 function is compensated for by other PAL
isoforms. A comprehensive screen of the complete Arabidopsis
genome revealed four PAL genes (Raes et al., 2003). The PAL
genes are expressed in many tissues (including seed, seedling,
leaf, root, flower, silique, and inflorescence stem), with PAL3
being generally expressed at a lower level (Wanner et al., 1995;
Raes et al., 2003). Expression of PAL1 and PAL2 is detected
most abundantly in roots and stems, where it increases during
the later stages of inflorescence stem development. Because
PAL1, PAL2, and PAL4 genes are most abundantly expressed
during the later stages of inflorescence stem development (Raes
et al., 2003), major effects of knock downs should manifest
themselves in the inflorescence stem. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
with specific primers was performed to clarify to what extent the
expression levels of each of the four genes were affected in the
mutants. As shown in Figure 3, T-DNA insertions in the PAL1 and
PAL2 genes effectively disrupted the expression of these genes
in the respective mutants. On the other hand, transcript levels
of the PAL1 and PAL2 genes were increased in the pal2 and
pal1 mutants, respectively, indicating a compensatory response
(Figure 3). Also, the PAL4 gene was significantly induced in all
mutants. The impact of PAL3, although altered in the pal2
mutant, was presumably weak because of its generally low
expression level (Figure 3; Wanner et al., 1995). Therefore, the
PAL transcripts are mainly derived from PAL2 and PAL4 in pal1
mutants, from PAL1 and PAL4 in pal2 mutants, and from PAL4 in
the double mutant.

Molecular Phenotype of palMutants 2751
To estimate the consequences of upregulation of other iso-
forms at the enzyme level, PAL activity was determined in
inflorescence stems of greenhouse-grown plants. As shown in
Figure 4, PAL activity in the inflorescence stem was clearly
reduced in the pal1 but not in the pal2 mutant. In the double
mutant, the 25% residual PAL activity must be derived mainly
from PAL4 transcripts (Figures 3 and 4). Additional activity
measurements in siliques and leaves of these plants revealed
none and a 50% reduced activity in all genotypes, respectively
(data not shown). Thus, most clear-cut differences in activity
were observed in the inflorescence stem, the tissue where PAL1
and PAL2 are most highly expressed. However, the lesion in
PAL2 was almost completely compensated for at the enzyme
level. Following the PAL activity during inflorescence growth,
PAL activity was highest in 10-week-old, seed-setting but still
green plants (Figure 4; data not shown). Assuming that at this age
the differences in PAL activity between the wild type and mutants
would also be highest, inflorescence stem material of 10-week-
old plants was used to conduct all further experiments.
Expression of 10 Genes Encoding Enzymes of Monolignol
Biosynthesis Is Strongly Altered in the palMutants
Our search was extended for consequences of PAL disruption on
the transcription of the remaining 30 genes encoding the nine
other enzymes of monolignol biosynthesis (Raes et al., 2003).
Their expression was assayed by RT-PCR with gene-specific
primers for each of the genes. Given the rapid alterations in
expression levels known to occur for many phenylpropanoid
genes and the semiquantitative nature of RT-PCR, a conservative
approach of fourfold change was taken to delineate those genes
with clear changes in expression. As shown in Figure 5, 23 of the
30 genes were expressed in 10-week-old inflorescence stems.
Among the genes that were judged important for the develop-
mental lignification of vascular tissues based on expression,
phylogenetic relationship, and occurrence of promoter elements
(Raes et al., 2003), pronounced changes in expression were

found for 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL1), para-coumarate
3-hydroxylase (C3H1), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate
hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeic acid O-methyltrans-
ferase (COMT), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD6).
Interestingly, similar trends in alteration of gene expression were
observed for most of them in both single pal mutants (Figure 5).
Only the expression of C3H1 was higher in the mutants, whereas
that of HCT, COMT, and CAD6 was lower (Figure 5). C3H1,
hydroxylating the C3 position of p-coumaroyl shikimic/quinic
acid, might be very prone to transcriptional regulation by the
concentration of certain pathway intermediates. On the other
hand, HCT activity is positively regulated by cinnamic acid (Lamb,
1977); hence, the decreased transcription probably correlated
with the reduced synthesis of cinnamic acid in the pal mutants.
Moreover, the HCT promoter contains both an H and a G box,
known to be necessary for feed-forward induction by p-coumaric
acid (Loake et al., 1992; Lindsay et al., 2002; Raes et al., 2003).
Thus, our data underscore the responsiveness of theHCT gene to
regulation by early pathway intermediates.
Caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferases CCoAOMT5,
CCoAOMT6, and CCoAOMT7, CAD2, and cinnamoyl-CoA re-
ductase (CCR2) with an altered expression in pal mutants had
not been selected as candidates for a role in developmental
lignification (Figure 5; Raes et al., 2003). CCR2, assigned
a primary function in pathogen response (Lauvergeat et al.,
2001), was also induced in the cellulose-deficient mutants de-
etiolated 3, radially swollen 1, and ectopic lignification 1-1 (Can˜o-
Delgado et al., 2003). Thus, CCR2 as well as the others might
become subject to transcriptional regulation upon alterations in
the concentration of pathway intermediates.
palMutants Are Affected in Transcription of Genes
Encoding Enzymes of Amino Acid, Phenylpropanoid,
and Carbohydrate Metabolisms
In view of the dramatic alterations in transcription of the most
closely related genes, we investigated the consequence of the
pal mutations on the transcriptome by a near genome-wide
cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) transcript
profiling of 10-week-old inflorescence stems. Transcript profiling
was performed on two biologically independent sets of the wild
type and the three mutants. Each single sample was a pool of 10
individual plants to normalize for the expected variability in gene
expression of individual plants. In the expression profiles, differ-
ential transcript-derived fragments were identified by their in-
crease/decrease in one or all mutants as compared with the wild
type. Fragments were withheld only when a similar expression
pattern was observed in both biological sets. For 63 differential
sequence tags, selected in this manner and classified in Table 1
according to functional categories, the corresponding genes in
Arabidopsis were identified. Among these 63 genes, three
groups accounted for one-third of the sequences (or 43% of
the genes with a known function): genes related to amino acid
synthesis and metabolism, to the phenylpropanoid pathway, and
to carbohydrate metabolism (Table 1).
The transcriptomes of pal1 and pal2 mutants from the same
biological material were also compared with the wild type with
a 6K-cDNA microarray. As shown in Table 2, expression signif-
icantly changed (twofold at P¼ 0.001) for 36 genes, of which only
three differential genes were common in both mutants. Convinc-
ingly, half of these genes (or 61% of the genes with a known
function) fell into the same three functional categories (amino
acid, phenylpropanoid, and carbohydrates) as in the cDNA-AFLP
experiment. Only two genes were found with both methods:
a homolog of Asn synthase (ASN3, At3g15450) and a putative
protein (At1g73330). The fact that 27 of the 63 tags found in the
cDNA-AFLP experiment are present on the microarray suggests
that many of these tags were not detected because of cross-
hybridization with transcripts of other gene family members or
transcript abundance. Clearly, cDNA-AFLP detected more dif-
ferentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction/gene
regulation and unknowns than the microarray (15 versus 3 and 14
versus 5, respectively). This observation underscores the com-
plementarity of both approaches and the higher sensitivity of the
cDNA-AFLP method for low-abundant messengers and mem-
bers of gene families.
Figure 6 shows an interesting trend by clustering all 97 tags
according to their expression in the mutants: the largest group of
genes linked specifically to the pal1 mutation identifies genes of
the phenylpropanoid pathway. Remarkably,;50% of the differ-
entials found in pal1 and pal2 mutants were common to pal1 and
pal2, and 27 of 32 of these common differentials were also found
in the double mutant (Figure 6). Only one gene (At3g12300,
unknown protein; Table 1) required both mutations for a change
in expression, altogether corroborating that the differentially
expressed genes were linked to the defect in PAL1 and PAL2,
and not to stochastic gene expression.
As summarized in Figure 7, 43 and 61% of the differentially
expressed genes with a known function identified through
cDNA-AFLP and microarray, respectively, were related to amino
acid, phenylpropanoid, and carbohydrate metabolisms. With
respect to amino acid metabolism, three tags recognized en-
zymes of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism:
chorismate mutase (CM), the first committed step in Phe and Tyr
biosynthesis; Trp synthase (TSB), performing the final step in
biosynthesis of Trp; and Tyr transaminase (TAT), degrading Phe

Type and pal1, pal2, and pal1 pal2 Mutants.

Molecular Phenotype of pal Mutants 2753
and Tyr (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 7). Two genes that are homologs
of ASN3 are upregulated in pal2 mutants (Tables 1 and 2). Four
other tags correspond to genes encoding components of the Gly
cleavage complex, primarily involved in photorespiration: two
different homologs of Gly dehydrogenase and two DNA binding
proteins (At1g69570 and At3g25990) that recognize motifs
present in the H protein promoter with the H protein itself being
part of the Gly decarboxylase enzyme complex (Tables 1 and 2).
In addition, Met synthase, upregulated in the pal2 mutant,
represents an interesting tag because it catalyzes the methyla-
tion of homocysteine with 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate as methyl
donor. This reaction does not only occur during de novo syn-
thesis but also during recycling of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
after S-adenosyl-Met (SAM) has donated its methyl group.
Besides the incorporation of Met into proteins, 80% of Met is
converted into SAM for various transmethylations that are also
very frequent in the phenylpropanoid pathway (Figure 7).
Among the phenylpropanoid pathway-related transcripts,
PAL1, PAL2, and 4CL1 were expressed in a manner consistent
with the results from the RT-PCR experiment (Tables 1 and 2,
Figures 3 and 5). The NADPH ferrihemoprotein reductase ATR3,
found particularly induced in the pal1 mutant, is probably part of
a microsomal P450 system that associates multiple P450 en-
zymes and NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductases. ATR homo-
logs from poplar (Populus trichocarpa 3 P. deltoides) and
Arabidopsis were shown to efficiently support the activity of
the P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), when coex-
pressed in yeast (Urban et al., 1997; Mizutani and Ohta, 1998; Ro
et al., 2002). Differential tags from a carboxymethylenebutenoli-
dase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), sinapoylglucose:
malate sinapoyltransferase (SNG1), a UDP-glucosyl transferase,
a glutathione S-transferase (GST), and a glutathioneS-conjugate
pump (GS-X pump) correspond to enzymes active toward the
endpoints of biosynthetic pathways originating from the phenyl-
propanoid pathway (Figure 7). The UDP-glucosyl transferase
belongs to the glycosyltransferase family 1; characterized mem-
bers use phenylpropanoids, such as flavonol and sinapate, as
substrates (http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). The GSTs of the f
and t subgroups, to which the downregulated GST also belongs
(GSTF12; Dixon et al., 2002), have been implicated in cytoplas-
mic stabilization of flavonoids and flavonoid conjugation before
uptake into the vacuole (Mueller et al., 2000; Dixon et al., 2002).
The ABC transporter (AtMRP2) identified here encodes a func-
tional GS-X pump of the plant vacuolar membrane with a high
capacity for glutathionated anthocyanins (Lu et al., 1998; Liu
et al., 2001; Sa´nchez-Ferna´ndez et al., 2001).
Perturbations in the PAL function seem to lead to adjustments
in carbon fixation and carbohydrate metabolism (Tables 1 and 2,
Figure 7). Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
(Rubisco) is upregulated in pal1 and pal2 mutants, and Rubisco
Figure 5. Expression of the Monolignol Biosynthesis Genes in pal Mutants.
Genes (34) were annotated with sensitive annotation methods for the 10 enzymes currently known to participate in the generation of monolignols (Raes
et al., 2003). Semiquantitative RT-PCRs were performed on two pools of 10 inflorescence stems of each respective genotype (see Methods).
Expression levels were normalized to ACT2 gene expression before calculation of fold changes in expression levels taking the wild-type level as
reference. Bars represent the average expression level of two biological repeats. Lines mark the level of fourfold upregulation or downregulation. Note
that the following genes were not found to be expressed at this stage of inflorescence stem development (10-week-old plants): C4H, C3H2, C3H3,
F5H2, CAD1, CAD4, and CAD5. For primers and gene nomenclature, see Raes et al. (2003).

Molecular Phenotype of pal Mutants 2757
activase is upregulated in the pal1 mutant. Both are central parts
of CO2 fixation into organic carbon (Table 2, Figure 7). Enzymes,
such as phosphoglycerate kinase and triose phosphate isomer-
ase, that metabolize the phosphoglycerate generated by Rubis-
co, are also upregulated in pal2 mutants (Tables 1 and 2, Figure
7). SNF4 (Akin g), upregulated in all pal mutants, plays important
regulatory roles in carbohydrate metabolism in yeast and Arabi-
dopsis (Table 1; Bouly et al., 1999). Trehalose 6-phosphate
synthase, upregulated in pal2 mutants, generates trehalose 6-
phosphate that, in turn, has an important function in controlling
the flux into glycolysis in yeast and controls carbohydrate use in
plants (Table 2; Eastmond and Graham, 2003; Schluepmann
et al., 2003). Invertase, upregulated in all mutants, and starch
phosphorylase, upregulated in the pal1 mutant, participate in the
generation of hexose phosphates from sucrose and starch
degradation, respectively. It is tempting to think that some of
these tags identify components that are involved in the gener-
ation of substrates for cell wall biosynthesis because cellulose
synthase was also induced in the pal1 and pal1 pal2 double
mutants (Table 1). b-Xylosidase, upregulated in both pal1 and
pal2 mutants (Table 2), hydrolyzes b-D-xylose residues of (most
likely) glucuronoarabinoxylans. The glucuronoarabinoxylans in
turn are able to covalently bind lignins and to attach to cellulose
(Hatfield et al., 1999).
Two smaller groups of tags relate to light signal transduction
and stress responses, two processes in which the importance of
flavonoids is well documented. Light-related transcripts are
found preferentially in the pal2 mutant. SPA1 and FAR are both
specific signaling intermediates of phytochrome A signal trans-
duction (Hoecker et al., 1999; Hudson et al., 1999). Two different
FAR homologs, one upregulated and one downregulated in the
pal2 mutant, are found (Table 1). Moreover, the pal2 mutant also
contains a CONSTANS-related transcription factor that is upre-
gulated (Table 2). Two other light-related tags are mutS and DNA
(apurinic or apyrimidinic) lyase, both involved in DNA repair that is
probably increased because of the lack of UV light-protecting
flavonoids (see below). v-3 Fatty acid desaturase and allene
oxide synthase participate and rate limit, respectively, the bio-
synthesis of jasmonate and are upregulated in all pal mutants
(Table 1, Figure 7).
pal1 pal2 Double Mutants Lack Three Major
Flavonol Glycosides
The alterations in gene transcription related to particular path-
ways prompted us to conduct a more in-depth biochemical
characterization of the mutants. In accordance with the tran-
scriptome data, and despite the near wild-type visible appear-
ance of the mutants, severe modifications in amino acids,
phenolics, and lignin accumulation were detected.
When the soluble phenolic compounds in the inflorescence
stem of the three mutants and the wild type were compared by
reverse-phase HPLC, significant changes in the profile were
noticed. As shown in the maxplots presented in Figure 8, reduced
PAL activity led to a decreased accumulation of several phenol-
ics. Out of 89 peaks in the analyzed chromatograms, eight peaks
differed significantly in abundance between the wild type and pal
mutants. As shown in Table 3, total phenolics were significantly
diminished to approximately one-third of the wild-type amount in
the pal1 pal2 double mutants, slightly reduced to 75% in pal1
mutants, and not affected in the pal2 mutant. This decrease in
total phenolics correlates with the levels of PAL activity (Figure 4)
and is mainly attributable to the depletion of the three major peaks
denoted as A, B, and C in Figure 8. As shown in Figure 9A, these

Expression is given as fold change of wild-type expression. The description of the genes is retrieved from MIPS; when the gene was annotated as
unknown, the closest homolog is given as obtained from PEDANT at MIPS (Frishman et al., 2003).
a Note that this gene is annotated as Ser carboxypeptidase at MIPS but has been shown to correspond to the SNG1 locus, encoding
sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase (Lehfeldt et al., 2000).

peaks correspond, on the basis of their retention time (RT),
photodiode array, and mass spectrometry (MS) spectra, to
previously identified kaempferol glycosides (Veit and Pauli,
1999): kaempferol 3-O-b-[b-D-glucopyranosyl(1-6)-D-gluco-
pyranoside]-7-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (Glc-Glc-Rha-kaemp-
ferol), kaempferol 3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside-7-O-a-L-rham-
nopyranoside (Glc-Rha-kaempferol), and kaempferol 3-O-
a-L-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (Rha-Rha-
kaempferol), respectively. The alterations in the accumulation
of these peaks in the single mutants were not statistically
significant but showed a trend to lower levels in the pal1 mutant
(Table 3). These glycosides belong to the flavonol glycosides that
are the major UV light-absorbing metabolites in Arabidopsis
(Graham, 1998). Interestingly, other UV light-protecting com-
pounds in Arabidopsis, such as sinapoyl glucose and sinapoyl
malate (Landry et al., 1995), were not altered in leaves or
inflorescence stems (thin-layer chromatography; data not
shown). To address whether the reduction of the three major
peaks in the double mutant was a result of a reduced synthesis of
trans-cinnamic acid, double mutants and the wild type were fed
for 24 h with trans-cinnamic acid or para-coumaric acid. Kaemp-
ferol glycoside peaks could not be restored in the double mutant
(data not shown), suggesting that the reduced PAL activity has
not only simple effects on the amount of its reaction product but
imbalances the phenylpropanoid pathway in a more sophisti-
cated way.
Feruloyl Malate Esters Coupled to Coniferyl Alcohol Are
Less Abundant in pal1 and pal1 pal2 Double Mutants
Besides the three major UV light–absorbing kaempferol glyco-
sides, five other peaks were significantly altered in the mutants,
one of which occurred only in the double mutant (RT 8.350 min;
not identified, Table 3). The compound at RT 6.033 min (Figure 8)
was identified as glycosylated vanillic acid by RT, photodiode
array spectrum, and comparison with an authentic standard
(Table 3).
The remaining three peaks were significantly reduced in pal1
and the double mutant, but not in the pal2 mutant (RT 7.331 min,
11.178 min, and 15.119 min; Table 3). MS analysis of the
compound eluting at 7.331 min indicated that this compound is
scopolin or isoscopolin (Figure 9B). The peak was identified as
scopolin because its aglycon released after hydrolysis consisted
exclusively of scopoletin (RT 11.37 min) and not of isoscopoletin
(RT 10.78 min). Scopolin had been detected previously in
tobacco leaf extracts (Baumert et al., 2001) but not in Arabi-
dopsis.
The compound eluting at 11.178 min has a UV/VIS spectrum
characterized by absorption maxima at 235 and 329 nm. MS
analysis suggested that this peak corresponds to the 4–O–8-
cross-coupling product of feruloyl malate and coniferyl alcohol,
FM(4–O–8)G, or 3-f4-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phe-
nyl)-1-hydroxymethyl-ethoxy]-3-methoxy-phenylg-acrylic acid
(Figure 9C). The core structure FA(4–O–8)G (FA, ferulic acid)
was authenticated using previously isolated FA(4–O–8)G from
ryegrass (Lolium perenne) (Ralph et al., 1992). The UV/VIS
spectrum (lmax at 242 and 332 nm) of the third compound (RT
15.119 min) was similar to that of FM(4–O–8)G. Based on MS
analysis and its partial authentication with FA(5–8)G, this com-
pound is suggested to be the related FM(5–8)G compound 2-f3-
[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-7-methoxy-
2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-5-yl]-acryloyloxyg-succinic acid (Figure
9D). Thus, the two latter products resulted from coupling of
coniferyl alcohol (at its favored 8-position) with feruloyl malate (at
its 4–O- or 5-position) and had not been described before.
In summary, only downregulation of both PAL1 and PAL2
leads to significant changes in the accumulation of the major
soluble phenolic compounds, the kaempferol glycosides (Table
3). On the other hand, the reduced accumulation of compounds
produced by other side branches of phenylpropanoid metabo-
lism, such as scopolin (hydroxycoumarin), and the feruloyl
malates coupled to coniferyl alcohol were clearly linked with
the mutation in PAL1 (Table 3, Figure 9). Sinapate esters were

notably unaffected in all mutants, indicating that either this
pathway is essential or that the enzymes producing sinapate
esters are in metabolic complexes with PAL isoforms other than
PAL1 and PAL2. This observation suggests that PAL1 and PAL2
are either associated with different cell types or with different
metabolic complexes within the cell or that PAL1 has a higher
activity than PAL2.
pal1 pal2Mutants Overaccumulate Phe and Are
Perturbed in Other Nonaromatic Amino Acids
Given the high number of differential transcripts related to
amino acid metabolism, amino acid concentrations were de-
termined in the wild type and the pal mutants. As shown in
Table 4, the reduction in PAL activity had dramatic conse-
quences for the accumulation of several amino acids, not only
the aromatic ones. The content of most amino acids was
increased in all mutants. As expected, Phe accumulated to >100-
fold in the double mutant as compared with the wild type,
whereas the other two aromatic amino acids, Tyr and Trp,
accumulated to fourfold (Table 4). Accordingly, the CM gene,
the first committed enzyme toward Phe and Tyr, as well as the
TSB gene, were only expressed in the three mutants but were
undetectable in the wild type in the transcript profiling exper-
iment (Table 1).
Another affected amino acid was Met that was significantly
increased in the pal2 mutant but decreased to 6% of the wild-
type level in the double mutant (Table 4). A transcript corre-
sponding to Met synthase was exclusively upregulated in the
pal2 mutant (Table 1). Finally, and noteworthy, Gly was only
detected in the wild type (Table 4). Four transcripts related to Gly
degradation were exclusively expressed or upregulated in thepal
mutants (Tables 1 and 2). By contrast, Asn was only detected in
the double mutant (Table 4). Correspondingly transcripts encod-
ing putative proteins with strong similarity to ASN were upregu-
lated in pal2 and pal1 pal2 mutants (Tables 1 and 2).
In conclusion, blocking PAL led to a strong overaccumulation
of Phe and imbalanced the abundance of many other amino
acids. Quite surprisingly, 15 out of 20 amino acids changed
significantly in at least one genotype (Table 4). The fact that the
concentration of these amino acids increases, except for Met in
the double mutant and Cys in pal1, suggests an overarching
mechanism for homeostasis of amino acid levels that acts across
individual biosynthetic pathways. Similarly, plants overexpress-
ing a Trp or Tyr decarboxylase, thus artificially creating a meta-
bolic sink, were altered in the aromatic and three nonaromatic
amino acids (Yao et al., 1995; Guillet et al., 2000).
pal1 pal2Mutants Have Less Lignin with a Higher
Syringyl/Guaiacyl Ratio
To determine lignification changes, lignin contents were mea-
sured via the acetyl bromide method, and monomer composi-
tions of the wild type and pal mutants were determined by
derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) analysis
(see Methods). As presented in Table 5, inflorescence stems of
3-month-old wild-type and mutant plants clearly differed in lignin
content as well as monomer composition despite the fact that
these differences were hardly apparent in histochemical analysis
(Figure 1). Double mutants had 30% residual lignin (Table 5), and
the molar ratio of S units in the noncondensed lignin fraction was
nearly double that in the wild type. S-rich lignins have higher
cleavable b-aryl ether levels and less condensed structures,
involving 5–5-, 8–5-, and 4–O–5-units (Ralph et al., 2004),
explaining the higher amount of G and S monomers from the
noncondensed fraction per gram of lignin. A similar reduction in
total lignin and increase in the S/G ratio was found in transgenic
tobacco downregulated for PAL (Sewalt et al., 1997; Korth et al.,
2001).
The determination of lignin content by acetyl bromide leads to
an underestimation of the amount of monomers linked by ester
bonds. Therefore, isolated cell wall material was saponified and
analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC profiles of the wild type and double
mutant were virtually identical (data not shown), indicating that
the amount of esters incorporated into the cell wall was not
significantly changed.

Molecular Phenotype of pal Mutants 2761
DISCUSSION
Molecular Phenotyping Is Informative
Genome-wide studies of the transcriptome allow explaining
a mutant phenotype at the molecular level at a depth that was
not possible before the development of genomic tools. The
extension of the phenotypic description to the molecular level
increases the resolution so that functional redundancy of closely
related gene family members can be separated. Thus, these
tools are excellent to provide an insight into the functional
significance of individual gene family members. Furthermore,
our study underscores that the disruption of a single gene can
have wide-ranging consequences on the transcription of other
genes, revealing the intricacy of interactions among metabolic
pathways, even in the absence of a visible phenotype (Tables 1
and 2). Elements of most of the pathways, altered in pal mutants,
have been previously described for their responsiveness to path-
ogen attack or elicitation (Figure 7; Somssich and Hahlbrock,
1998). However, in contrast with transcriptome profiling after
challenging the plant, typically designed to reconstruct a path-
way response to a particular agent or environmental stress,
our aim was to describe the adaptation of the transcriptome to
genetic differences at a particular locus. In a similar study on the
brevipedicellus mutant that is disrupted in a KNOX gene and
displays premature lignin deposition, expression differed in 12
genes related to lignification or cell wall biosynthesis (Mele et al.,
2003). Among these are 4CL1, PAL1, TAT, and cellulose syn-
thase, genes that are also differentially expressed in the pal
mutants (Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, ASN, differentially ex-
pressed in the brevipedicellus and pal2 mutant, is known to
respond dramatically at the transcriptional level to metabolites,
light, and development (Lam et al., 1998). Thus, our study might
have identified genes that are under metabolic regulation, as
opposed to genes involved in a pathway’s response to environ-
mental or developmental signals.
Altogether, the pal1 and pal2 mutations cause 58 and 72
genes, respectively, to change in expression within our exper-
iment and degree of transcriptome resolution (20% with the
microarray and 60% with the cDNA-AFLP; Figure 6). In the pal
mutants, the expression of several differentially expressed genes
depends probably on the level of one or more biochemical
compounds generated or consumed by PAL, such as Phe and
cinnamic acid or their upstream and downstream derivatives.

Soluble phenolics are separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The maxplot chromatograms are given as absorbance units at 200 to 450 nm and are scaled
down to show the differences in the most abundant peaks. A, B, and C denote the three major kaempferol glycosides decreased in the double mutant.
2762 The Plant Cell
However, among the differentially expressed genes, there will
also be genes that are expressed as a result of secondary effects
of altered cellular processes.
A Reduced Carbon Flux into the Phenylpropanoid Pathway
Affects the Homeostasis of Amino Acid and
Carbohydrate Metabolism
Under normal conditions, 20% of all fixed carbon is pumped into
the shikimate pathway (Herrmann, 1995). One of the major drains
to this pathway is PAL, consuming Phe. Because the pal1 pal2
double mutant has 30% residual total extractable phenolics and
30% residual lignin, carbon supply must be either adjusted or
diverted to other pathways (Tables 3 and 5). Taking into account,
moreover, that PAL1 expression occurs only in the vascular
bundle (Leyva et al., 1995) and that PAL2 expression also
preferentially correlates with lignified inflorescence stems (Raes
et al., 2003), most of the observed molecular alterations in the
mutants are expected to be manifest in a limited number of cell
types in the stem (Figure 1).
Assuming that most transcriptomic changes concern the
same few cell types, the three major downstream branches of
the phenylpropanoid pathway (flavonoids, lignins, and sinapate
esters) undergo a different adaptation to the reduced flux into the
pathway in the mutants: the production of flavonoids and lignin is
clearly reduced. Additionally, hydroxycoumarins, glycosylated
vanillic acid, and FM(4–O–8)G and FM(5–8)G are reduced in
abundance (Table 3), whereas sinapate esters remain un-
changed. Because all flavonoids, sinapate esters, and hydroxy-
coumarins have UV light-protecting capacities, the sinapate
esters remain probably produced because they are most effec-
tive in UV light shielding. Alternatively, sinapate esters could be
derived from a metabolic complex involving a PAL isoform other
than PAL1 or PAL2.
As summarized in Figure 7, signs of molecular adjustments are
not only found in the phenylpropanoid pathway but also in the
shikimate pathway, in the related cell wall biosynthesis, in
components of central metabolism such as glycolysis, and even
in distant stress-related pathways. In the transcriptome data
(Figures 3 and 5, Tables 1 and 2), the complete sequence of the
early phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is reconstructed, except for
C4H (Figure 7). Similarly, in PAL-suppressed tobacco plants,
C4H expression remains unchanged (Blount et al., 2000). How-
ever, a NADPH P450 reductase gene ATR3, shown to support
C4H activity in vitro, was upregulated (Table 1; Urban et al., 1997;
Mizutani and Ohta, 1998; Ro et al., 2002). Probably the reduced
flux through PAL superinduces transcription of the consecutive
genes: the respective otherPAL gene(s),ATR3, 4CL1, andC3H1.
To the contrary, genes encoding components in the flavonoid
pathway (e.g., CHS, DFR,GST, and AtMRP2) and genes thought
to be specific for lignification (e.g., COMT and CAD6) are
downregulated.
With respect to the shikimate pathway generating the aromatic
amino acids, transcripts for the enzyme at the branch point (CM)
and two enzymes at the respective end points (TSB and TAT)
were differentially expressed (Figure 7). All three hold a great
potential for exerting control over the flux in this pathway. Phe,
accumulating to 100-fold in the double mutant, and Trp, accu-
mulating to fourfold in the double mutant, exert negative and
positive feedback control on CM, respectively, and Trp also
negatively regulates anthranilate synthase in its own biosynthe-
sis (Bentley, 1990). On the other hand, Trp synthase is upregu-
lated in pal mutants, pointing to a counterbalancing mechanism
for decreased anthranilate synthase. TAT, transcriptionally
downregulated in pal1 mutants, degrades Phe and Tyr (Figure
7). Its expression might be downregulated to limit the degrada-
tion of Phe to keep feeding substrate into the PAL reaction.
Together, a severe imbalance in a part of the pathway might
override classical feedback mechanisms. The accumulation of
aromatic amino acids seems to cause further adjustments in the
abundance of as many as 15 amino acids, indicating a general
amino acid homeostasis (Table 4).
Clearly, many changes also occur in the primary metabolism of
the pal mutants (Figure 7). Several studies reveal the reverse,

2764 The Plant Cell
namely, consequences of downregulation or disruption of
enzyme functions in primary metabolism for secondary metab-
olism. For example, downregulation of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-hep-
tulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (shikimate pathway) or plastid
transketolase (TK, Figure 7) leads to a decrease in aromatic
amino acids, phenylpropanoids, and lignin (Jones et al., 1995;
Henkes et al., 2001). On the contrary, here, far-reaching con-
sequences for primary metabolism caused by a disruption in an
enzyme of secondary metabolism have been found at the
transcriptional level (Figure 7). One striking example is the
upregulation of the Rubisco-encoding gene in pal1 and pal2
mutants (Table 2). Only the opposite (namely, Rubisco down-
regulation and a corresponding decrease in the Phe pool) have
been shown before in tobacco (Matt et al., 2002). These
observations raise the possibility that primary and secondary
metabolism are interlocked through Phe pools.
Reduction in Lignin Is Not Compensated for by Cellulose
in palMutants
Lignin and polysaccharides are two principal components of the
secondary thickened cell wall. A common assumption is that
these cell wall components are coordinately regulated and can
compensate for each other. In the pal mutants, having reduced
lignin levels, several transcripts related to cell wall polysacchar-
ides (most importantly, cellulose synthase and b-xylosidase)
were identified as upregulated, but the corresponding changes in
cell wall composition could not be detected. No clear differences
between the wild type and mutants were found by cellulose
histochemistry and analysis of the total polysaccharide compo-
sition (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in lignin does not
seem to be compensated for by cellulose. Arabidopsis mutants
with a reduced cellulose synthesis can exhibit ectopic lignifica-
tion (Taylor et al., 1999; Can˜o-Delgado et al., 2000, 2003),
whereas irregular xylem 4 mutants, disrupted in the CCR gene,
have less lignin but not more cellulose (Jones et al., 2001). Thus,
a reduction in cellulose synthesis, which precedes lignin de-
position, is sensed to induce extra lignification (Ellis et al., 2002;
Can˜o-Delgado et al., 2003), but a reduction in lignin deposition is
not necessarily compensated for by cellulose biosynthesis. In
a few cases, in which a reduced lignin accumulation was
accompanied by an increased cellulose content, alterations in
development have been observed (Hu et al., 1999; Li et al., 2003).
An increased cellulose content in lignin-deficient plants might
arise from pleiotropic effects of decreased lignification rather
than from compensation for lignin by cellulose in each single cell.
Alternatively, the lack of polysaccharide changes in the pal
mutants has to be explained by the subtle nature of these
changes or the failure of the methods applied; a complex mixture
of different cell types present in the whole inflorescence stem is
used for chemical analyses, whereas only the fraction of cells
with secondary cell wall thickening is expected to display
changes.
A Role in Cross-Linking for the Novel Coupling Products
of Feruloyl Malate and Coniferyl Alcohol?
Although no gross differences were observed, various signs of
decreased cell wall rigidity, particularly in the interfascicular
fibers, were noticed in the double mutant (Figure 2). This

Molecular Phenotype of pal Mutants 2765
phenotype is probably linked to the 30% residual lignin levels in
the pal1 pal2 mutants but could possibly also arise from the
decreased abundance of the novel compounds, FM(4–O–8)G
and FM(5–8)G, in the pal1 and pal1 pal2 mutants (Table 3). The
malate esters of FA coupled to coniferyl alcohol have not yet
been identified before in plants, but ajugol, methyl, and glucose
esters of FA(4–O–8)G and/or FA(5–8)G have been reported
(Yamamoto et al., 1993; Wahl et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1999). The
core structure FA(4–O–8)G esterified to arabinosyl units has
been found in saponified grass and cereal cell walls (Jacquet
et al., 1995; Grabber et al., 2002; Bunzel et al., 2004). Generally,
FA is esterified to the polysaccharides during their biosynthesis
in the endomembrane system, and the feruloyl esters can un-
dergo oxidative coupling, thereby linking polysaccharides in the
cell wall (Ralph et al., 1999; Fry, 2004). It is possible that the
malate ester of FA (coupled with coniferyl alcohol) is an in-
termediate that can become transesterified to polysaccharides.
If this were the case, the reduced rigidity of the cell wall observed
in the double mutant could partly arise from weaker cross-
coupling of polysaccharides with each other and with lignin.
The Molecular Phenotypes of pal1 and pal2Mutants
Reveal Distinct Roles for PAL1 and PAL2 in
Phenylpropanoid Production
Isoforms of PAL have been shown to differ in posttranslational
modification, metabolite sensitivity, localization, and association
with metabolite channeling complexes (Sarma et al., 1998;
Allwood et al., 1999; Rasmussen and Dixon, 1999; Kao et al.,
2002). Only few studies have examined the contribution of
isoforms to different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway
(Howles et al., 1996; Sarma et al., 1998; Rasmussen and Dixon,
1999). However, the specificity of the isoforms from other spe-
cies cannot readily be transferred to those in Arabidopsis.
pal1 and pal2 mutants are indistinguishable at the phenotypic
level, and only the double mutant has slight phenotypic changes
together with a clear reduction in kaempferol glycosides and
lignin (Figures 1 and 2, Tables 3 and 5). Considering the 34 genes
that code for the enzymes of monolignol biosynthesis, similar
trends in alteration of gene expression were observed for most of
them in both single pal mutants (e.g., HCT, CCoAOMT5, COMT,
and CAD6, Figure 5). Although this observation argues for
a functional overlap of PAL1 and PAL2, the fact that expression
levels of these four genes were closer to the wild-type level in the
double mutant than in the single mutants corroborates a more
complex metabolic interaction (Figure 5). On the other hand,
expression of several genes was only significantly increased in
the double mutant (4CL1 and CCoAOMT6; Figure 5), arguing for
a synergistic action of PAL1 and PAL2 in the generation of
particular phenylpropanoids. Still, the differential expression of
several genes is correlated with only one of the two mutations:
PAL3, C3H1, and CCoAOMT7 with pal2, and CCR2 with pal1
(Figures 3 and 5). Although it is too early to speculate on how this
transcriptional regulation corresponds to the differential accu-
mulation of a particular metabolite or with particular metabolic
complexes, these transcriptional differences clearly indicate
directions toward the specific roles of these two PAL isoforms.
When the altered transcripts of other pathways in either pal1 or
pal2 (and the double mutant) are compared, more tags relate to
light, UV light protection, and stress in pal2 than in pal1 mutants
(Figures 5, 6, and 7). On the other hand, pal1 mutants are more
altered in phenylpropanoid-related transcripts (PAL1, PAL2,
ATR3, 4CL1, DFR, CHS, GST, GS-X pump, and SNG1, Figure
7). In accordance with these transcriptomic changes, the pal1,
but not the pal2, mutant has reduced total extractable phenolics
because of a decrease in sugar-conjugated kaempferols, sco-
polin, FM(4–O–8)G, and FM(5–8)G (Table 3).
The difference in aromatic carbon flux seems to translate in
different ways to carbon flux in both mutants. The lack of C6-C3
carbon probably signals in both mutants a demand for more
carbon; transcripts correlated with photosynthetic carbon fixa-
tion and with sucrose degradation are upregulated in both
mutants (e.g., Rubisco and invertase; Figure 7). However, based
on the transcriptomic changes that exclusively occur in pal1
mutants, the excess carbon is stored away as starch in pal1
mutants (starch synthase: up, starch phosphorylase; involved in
starch degradation: down; Figure 7). On the other hand, in pal2
mutants, carbon is rather redirected toward other processes;
transcripts related to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (e.g.,
trehalose 6P-synthase, triose-P isomerase, phosphoglycerate
kinase: up; Figure 7). Possibly part of this carbon is used to
generate more amino acids because the levels of many amino
acids are higher in pal2 than in pal1 (Table 4).
The understanding of the transcriptome and biochemistry
provide novel insight into the functional differences of the two
PAL isoforms. On the basis of these observations, a PAL1 knock
down has more severe consequences for the phenylpropa-
noid pathway than a PAL2 knock down. Whereas both en-
zymes contribute to the production of lignin precursors, PAL1 is
of higher importance for the generation of flavonoids in the
inflorescence stem. To elaborate on the specific functions of the
PAL isoforms in Arabidopsis, future experiments need to address

2766 The Plant Cell
the function of the two other PALs and the potentially different
localization of all PALs at the cellular and tissue levels.
The application of a similar molecular phenotyping strategy to
other mutants in the 34 genes that encode the 10 known
enzymes in the monolignol pathway (Raes et al., 2003) will allow
us to answer long-standing questions on the metabolic regula-
tion within the phenylpropanoid pathway, between metabolic
pathways, and on the functional divergence in the gene families.
In addition, comparative transcriptome analysis of this set of
mutants should allow the discrimination between genes regu-
lated by metabolites and genes expressed as a result of
pleiotropic effects of a particular mutation. The comparative
approach will also help to elucidate the function of the class of
unknown genes that still constitute 20% of all differential tran-
scripts identified in the pal mutants. These unknown genes are
expected to fall into the same broad functional categories as the
other differential genes; hence, new candidate genes that play
a role in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis will be identified.
METHODS
Plant Growth Conditions
For germination, seeds were surface sterilized and placed on MS medium
(Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10 g L1
sucrose (and if required with 50 mg L1 kanamycin). After the seeds
had undergone a cold treatment for homogenous germination (overnight
at 48C), they were exposed to 208C, 50 mmol m2 s1 light intensity, and
70% humidity under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Plants were transferred
to a greenhouse after 14 d. Conditions were as follows: 50 mmol m2 s1
light intensity at plant level (MBFR/U 400-W incandescent lamps; Philips,
Eindhoven, The Netherlands), a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle, 40% relative
humidity, 238C, and without shielding from incident daylight. Plant
material was always harvested between 11 AM and 1 PM.
Generation of the palMutants and Double Mutant and
Identification of the Genotypes
Primary transformants of SL12-17 (pal1) and of L1-138 (pal2) were
obtained through transformation with the pSL1 and pSL4 constructs,
respectively (Babiychuk et al., 1997). The exon-trap vector contains,
starting from the right border of the T-DNA, the first intron and second
exon of the apurinic endonuclease gene fused in frame to the neomycin
phosphotransferase II (NPTII) gene lacking its translation initiation codon.
The first intron of the apurinic endonuclease gene lacks its 59 donor splice
site. Together, kanamycin resistance after integration of this T-DNA is
only achieved in those plants, where the host gene provides promoter
activity, an ATG codon, and a 59 donor splice site. After the intron is
spliced out, a chimeric transcript of the host gene, apurinic endonuclease
exon 2, and NPTII is made. Insertions in the PAL1 and PAL2 genes were
revealed by 59 rapid amplification of cDNA ends using aNPTII primer. The
precise insertion place for both genes was delineated to the first intron
through sequencing of a genomic PCR product spanning from the first
PAL1 and PAL2 exon to the 59 end of the NPTII gene (data not shown).
Single locus, homozygous lines were obtained by self-fertilization and
segregation analysis.
The pal1 pal2 double mutant was generated by crossing pal1 and pal2,
using either as female and male parent. In the F2 progeny of both crosses,
sterile double mutants were identified in the expected Mendelian ratios.
Therefore, the double mutant had to be identified for each experiment in
the progeny of plants homozygous for one but heterozygous for the other
mutation. To identify the wild-type and mutated PAL1 and PAL2 genes,
the following primers were used as sense and antisense primers,
respectively: for pal1, 59-ATGGAGATTAACGGGGCACAC-39 and 59-GCA-
TCAGAGCAGCCGATTGTCTGTT-39; for PAL1, 59-ATGGAGATTAACGG-
GGCACAC-39 and 59-CATGGCGGCTCTTGTGGCGG-39; for pal2,
59-ATGGATCAAATCGAAGCAATG-39 and 59-GCATCAGAGCAGCC-
GATTGTCTGTT-39; for PAL2, 59-ATGGATCAAATCGAAGCAATG-39 and
59-CATGGCGGCTCTTGTGGCGG-39. PCR reactions (reaction buffer as
supplied with the Taq polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphate at 200
pmol, primers at 100 ng) were performed as follows: 30 cycles at 948C for
30 s, at 508C for 30 s, at 728C for 2 min, and a final extension step at 728C
for 10 min. PCR products were separated in 1% agarose gels.
DNA and RNA Extractions
For the identification of double mutants in the progeny of plants
homozygous for one but heterozygous for the other mutation, DNA was
extracted for use in PCR reactions according to Edwards et al. (1991).
Total RNA from stem tissues was extracted with the TRIzol method
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA (5 mg) was subsequently reverse
transcribed into double-stranded cDNA.
RT-PCRs
All primers used for the amplification of monolignol biosynthesis genes
were as described in Raes et al. (2003) and are available at http://
www.psb.ugent.be/bioinformatics/. All these primers spanned over at
least one intron, so that amplification from the contaminating genomic
template could easily be recognized. The ACT2 gene (At3g18780), to
which the RT-PCRs were normalized when expressed as relative expres-
sion levels, was amplified with the following sense and antisense primers,
respectively: 59-GTTGCACCACCTGAAAGGAAGT-39 and 59-CAATGG-
GACTAAAACGCAAAAC-39 to generate a fragment of 364 bp on cDNA.
In RT-PCR experiments, reactions in 25 mL (reaction buffer as supplied
with the Taq polymerase, 50 ng of each primer) contained a modified
nucleotide mix: dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP were at 200 pmol, whereas dATP
was reduced to 20 pmol. To each reaction, 0.1 mL of 33P-labeled dATP
(10 mCi mL1, 2500 Ci mmol1) was added, resulting in a hot-to-cold
dATP ratio of 1:2500. Products were separated on 4.5% polyacrylamide
or 1% agarose gels and visualized on dried gels through autoradiography.
To assure at least semiquantitative assays, the linear range of the
PCR reaction was determined for each gene by testing at least two tem-
plate concentrations (1 mL 1:10 diluted cDNA and 1 mL undiluted cDNA)
and three different PCR reaction cycles (21, 24, and 30).
Transcript Profiling and Handling of Differentially Expressed
cDNA Fragments
cDNA-AFLP starting with 5 mg of total RNA was performed as described
by Breyne et al. (2002). Amplified fragments were considered interesting
when their pattern of expression was the same in the two biological sets
used. Fragments were cut out, reamplified, and directly sequenced.
Sequences were subjected to a tBLASTX against GenBank and
a BLASTN against all Arabidopsis thaliana accessions at EMBL. The
best-hit sequence was aligned with the fragment and analyzed for the
correct BstYI and MseI restriction sites in the respective part of
the sequence, for the correct nucleotide extensions at the restriction
sites, and for the correct size of the resulting BstYI/MseI fragment. Only
when all criteria were fulfilled was the database hit considered correct.
Microarray Hybridization
The 6528 genes were spotted in duplicate on the microarray, of which
6008 were from a unigene clone collection from Incyte (Arabidopsis Gem
Molecular Phenotype of pal Mutants 2767
I; Incyte, Palo Alto, CA) and 520 positive and negative controls from the
Universal Score Card spike set (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont,
UK); for details, see http://www.microarrays.be/service.htm/currently
available arrays. Total RNA (5mg) of each sample was reverse transcribed
and amplified according to a modified protocol for in vitro transcription
and subsequently fluorescently labeled with Cy5 or Cy3 (Amersham
Biosciences; http://www.microarrays.be/service.htm/protocols). Hybrid-
ization and washing were performed in an automated hybridization sta-
tion (Amersham Biosciences) for a 16-h cycle (http://www.microarrays.
be/service.htm/protocols). The arrays were scanned at 532 and 635 nm
by a Generation III scanner (Amersham Biosciences), and images were
analyzed with ArrayVision (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario,
Canada). Spot intensities were measured as artifact-removed total
intensities (ARVol) without correction for background.
Microarray Data Analysis
Slides were normalized by plotting for each single slide M ¼ log2(R/G)
against A ¼ log2OR 3 G for each spot (Yang et al., 2002). Subsequent
Lowess normalization (Lowess window width ¼ 0.2) yielded adjusted
log2R and log2G signal intensities. Normalized spots were processed by
two sequential analyses of variance (ANOVAs; Wolfinger et al., 2001).
Using this mixed model approach, as implemented in restricted maxi-
mum likelihood assay in Genstat (Payne and Arnold, 2002), the fixed and
random effects were fitted simultaneously, and significance for the fixed
genotype effects was calculated using the Wald statistics. The P value
cutoff was set at 0.001. No further adjustments for multiple testing were
performed.
Determination of PAL Activity
PAL activity was determined as previously described (Legrand et al.,
1976). Homogenized samples were extracted with 0.1 M sodium borate,
pH 8.8, and centrifuged for 10 min at 48C and 14,000 rpm. The total
protein content of the supernatant was determined according to the
Bradford assay. Samples of 10 to 50 mg total protein were then allowed to
digest a mixture of 100 nmol L-Phe and 0.01 nmol 14C-L-Phe (ratio
10,000:1 cold:hot) for 3 h at 378C. The volume was increased by the
addition of water and extracted with a double volume of cyclohexane/
ether (1:1 [v/v]). The organic phase was measured in a scintillation counter
for the 14C-trans-cinnamic acid. The partitioning coefficient of cinnamic
acid between the water and the organic phase was determined to be
;50% under our experimental conditions. Using 0.2 nmol 14C-L-Phe as
a standard for the counts/minute, the pmol cinnamic acid s1 mg1
protein was calculated.
Light Microscopy and Lignin Histochemistry
Vibroslices (50 to 100 mm thick) of agarose-embedded fresh stem
material of 3-month-old plants were collected in water or 92% ethanol
and immediately stained. Lignin staining after Wiesner was performed in
1% phloroglucinol in 92% ethanol for 2 min. The specimens were
subsequently incubated in 25% HCl and immediately observed. Speci-
mens for lignin staining after Ma¨ule were stained in 1% KMnO4 for 5 min,
rinsed with water, incubated in 37% HCl:H2O (1:1 [v/v]) for 2 min, and
observed after the addition of a drop of NH3. Lignin staining with
concentrated aniline sulfate in water proceeded for 3 to 5 min and was
stopped by the addition of diluted H2SO4:H2O (1:2 [v/v]). Specimens were
observed in water (Spearing, 1953).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Basal parts of 3-month-old inflorescence stems of all genotypes were
harvested and trimmed to smaller pieces before fixation. These pieces
were fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaralde-
hyde and postfixed with 1% OsO4 and 1.5% K3Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M Na-
cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples were dehydrated through a graded
ethanol series, including a bulk staining with 2% uranyl acetate at the 50%
ethanol step. Ethanol was subsequently replaced by LR white hard grade
embedding medium (London Resin, Basingstoke, UK) and samples
embedded in LR white. Ultrathin sections of gold interference color were
cut using an ultramicrotome and collected on collodion-coated Cu grids
of 200 mesh. The sections were post-stained in an ultrostainer (Leica,
Herburgg, Switzerland) for 15 min in 2% uranyl acetate (Ultrostain 1;
Leica) at 408C and 4 min in lead citrate (Ultrostain 2; Leica) at 208C. The
sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope 1010
(JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
Analysis of Soluble Phenolics and Amino Acids
Three-month-old, fully grown, still-green plants of the four genotypes
(10 wild-type plants, 6 plants of pal1, 6 plants of pal2, and 7 plants of
pal1 pal2) were harvested after flowering had ceased. Whole inflores-
cence stems (without leaves, siliques, or flowers) were immediately
frozen and homogenized in liquid nitrogen. Soluble phenolics were
analyzed as described by Meyermans et al. (2000). Briefly, the material
was extracted with methanol and the supernatant dried and extracted
with cyclohexane/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1 [v/v]).
Phenolics in the aqueous phase were separated and analyzed by reverse-
phase HPLC. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a 996 diode array
detector (Waters, Milford, MA) scanning from 200 to 450 nm. The peak
height was quantified at the maximum absorbance value between 250
and 450 nm. Data collection and integration were done using the
Millenium software (Waters). Peak height/dry weight of 89 peaks (sub-
tracting the major but indifferent peak at retention time of 5.46 in the
beginning of the chromatogram) were analyzed with weighted one-way
ANOVA, with P ¼ 0.05 for the F test as well as for the least square
difference post-hoc test.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of the water
phase was performed using a gradient separation from 83% solvent A
(aqueous, 1% acetic acid) to 77% solvent B (acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid)
in 21 min on a reverse-phase Luna C18 column (150 3 2.1 mm, 3 mm;
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow of 0.30 mL min1 (SpectraSystem
P1000XR HPLC pump; Thermo Separation Products, Riviera Beach, FL)
and a column temperature of 408C (SpectraSystem AS1000 autosampler;
Thermo Separation Products). UV/VIS absorption spectra were taken
between 200 and 450 nm on a SpectraSystem UV6000LP detector
(Thermo Separation Products). Full MS spectra were obtained in the
positive or negative ionization mode on a LCQ Classic MS instrument
(ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA), using atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization as ion source. Vaporizer temperature, capillary temperature,
sheath gas, aux gas, and the source current were set at 4508C, 1508C, 64,
3, and 5mA, or at 4008C, 1508C, 23, 6, and 5 mA in the positive or negative
ionization mode, respectively. MSn spectra were obtained by single
reaction monitoring using a collision energy of 35%.
The methanol extracts were also used for amino acid analysis. Of the
extracts, 5 mL was directly applied to an amino acid analyzer (420A
derivatizer with an online 130A separation system; Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Amino acids were identified by cochromatography with
authentic standards. Peak height/dry weight were analyzed with one-way
ANOVA, with P ¼ 0.05 for the F test and the Dunnett’s post-hoc test.
The lyophilized scopolin peak and synthetic scopolin were subjected
to acid hydrolysis (1 N HCl, 3 h at 908C). The reaction products were
resolved on HPLC, as described above, and authenticated with
standards of scopoletin and isoscopoletin. Synthetic compounds for
authentication were vanillate (Acros, Geel, Belgium), scopoletin (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), isoscopoletin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), and
FA(4-O-8)G (Ralph et al., 1992). FA(8-5)G was isolated from the mixture
obtained by cross-coupling coniferyl alcohol with ethyl FA via MnO2 in
2768 The Plant Cell
acetone followed by saponification (H. Kim and J. Ralph, unpublished
data). Scopolin was synthesized from scopoletin (Chaudhury et al., 1948).
Substrate Feeding Assays and Thin-Layer Chromatography
of Sinapate Esters
Substrate feeding assays with 1 mM of cinnamic acid or para-coumaric
acid were performed on 15 cm inflorescence stems. Stems were cut
under water to avoid collapse of the vascular stream and placed into
water with the respective substrate for 24 h. Stem pieces from above the
part that was in contact with the substrate were harvested, immediately
frozen, and analyzed as above. Thin-layer chromatography of sinapate
esters were run as described by Lehfeldt et al. (2000) using leaves and
inflorescence stems of 10-week-old greenhouse-grown plants.
Acetyl Bromide Soluble Lignin Determination and
DFRC Analysis of Lignin
The inflorescence stems of five plants of each C24, pal1, pal2, and pal1
pal2 were harvested individually after 3 months of growth. Plants were
green, and flowering had ceased. Stem pieces were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried. The ABSL assay was performed as
detailed (Fukushima and Hatfield, 2001). ABSL was calculated using an
extinction coefficient of 17.2. DFRC lignin analysis was performed
essentially as described previously (Lu and Ralph, 1997; Ralph and Lu,
1998). Monomer determination was performed using response factors
(coniferyl diacetate (G), 1.39; sinapyl diacetate (S), 1.44) derived from
monomer standards against the internal standard (4,49-ethylidenebis-
phenol; Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI).
Cell Wall Isolation and Saponification
Inflorescence stem material (1.5 g) of the wild type and double mutant
was ground in liquid nitrogen and taken up in 30 mL 50 mM NaCl. This
mixture was kept at 48C overnight. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at
3500 rpm, and the pellet was extracted with 40 mL 80% ethanol and
sonicated for 20 min. This extraction was repeated twice. Centrifugation,
extraction, and sonication were repeated exactly with the following
extractives: acetone, chloroform:methanol (1:1), and acetone. Samples
were allowed to air dry. Saponification of isolated cell walls was
performed overnight in 2 M NaOH at room temperature under nitrogen.
Extracts were neutralized with 2 M HCl under nitrogen and centrifuged.
The supernatant was analyzed with liquid chromatography–mass spec-
trometry as above.
Carbohydrate Analysis
The xylem tissue from the stems was dried and ground (100 mesh). The
powder was extracted successively with a mixture of toluene and ethanol
(2:1 [v/v]), with ethanol, and with hot water, and then freeze-dried. The cell
wall material was hydrolyzed by the 72% H2SO4 method and the sugars
analyzed by gas chromatography of the alditol acetate derivatives as
described (Chambat et al., 1997).
