Par-4–Dependent Apoptosis by the Dietary Compound Withaferin Ain Prostate Cancer CellsSowmyalakshmi Srinivasan,1Rama S. Ranga,1Ravshan Burikhanov,2Seong-Su Han,2and Damodaran Chendil1Departments of 1Clinical Sciences, College of Health Sciences and 2Radiation Medicine, College of Medicine, University ofKentucky, Lexington, KentuckyAbstractDeletion or mutation of the androgen receptor (AR) rendersprostate tumors refractory to apoptosis by androgen ablation,the mainstay of prostate cancer therapy. To identify noveltherapeutics that can induce apoptosis regardless of the ARstatus of prostate cancer cells, we screened dietary herbalcompounds using a reporter assay for the prostate apoptosisresponse-4 (Par-4) gene, which induces p53- and PTEN-independent and cancer-selective apoptosis. One of thecompounds, withaferin A (WA), a major constituent ofthe dietary compound Withania somnifera , induced Par-4–dependent apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancercells and regression of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice.Interestingly, restoration of wild-type AR in PC-3 (AR negative)cells abrogated both Par-4 induction and apoptosis by WA.Individually, WA and anti-androgens induced neither Par-4nor apoptosis in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells,yet in combination, WA and anti-androgen synergisticallyinduced Par-4 and apoptosis in androgen-responsive prostatecancer cells. Thus, when judiciously combined with anti-androgens, WA inhibits survival of both androgen-responsiveand androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells by a Par-4–dependent mechanism. As Par-4 up-regulation induces apo-ptosis in most tumor cells, our findings can be extended tohigh-throughput screens to identify synergistic combinationsfor both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant cancers.[Cancer Res 2007;67(1):246–53]IntroductionProstate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-relateddeaths in men in the United States (1). About 234,460 new cases ofprostate cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States alone,and the numbers are projected to increase as longevity expands theaging population (1). Both androgen and its cognate receptor[androgen receptor (AR)] are recognized risk factors in thedevelopment of prostate cancer (2–5). These observations arefurther corroborated by genetic evidence from transgenic mousemodels, suggesting that increased AR signaling in the prostate islinked to an increase in precancerous lesions (6). Accordingly, themost effective treatment for early-stage prostate cancer includessuppression of AR function either by blocking androgen signalingwith the anti-androgens bicalutamide (Casodex) or flutamide or byinhibiting the conversion of testosterone to the potent androgendihydrotestosterone with finasteride. As prostate cancer cells aredependent on AR signaling for survival and growth, either theremoval of androgen or blocking dihydrotestosterone synthesisleads to the induction of apoptosis in clinical prostate cancer aswell as in cell culture and animal models of prostate cancer (7, 8).However, f30% of these patients show relapse of the diseasewithin 3 years as a result of the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, which are either AR positiveor AR negative (9, 10). The molecular mechanisms dictating theprogression from androgen dependence to androgen independenceare unclear due to the lack of suitable experimental modelsand molecular markers (11). In general, however, AR can be acti-vated despite androgen blockade therapy in AR-positive prostatecancer (12). This is attributed to an increased sensitivity of ARto low concentrations of androgen due to mutations in AR,AR partner-protein interactions, or post-translational modifica-tions; these underlying factors function to promote androgendepletion-independent signaling (13). Thus, alternative therapeuticapproaches to inhibit AR function in a ligand-independent mannerare needed to treat prostate cancer.The proapoptotic protein prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4)was originally identified in prostate cancer cells undergoingapoptosis in response to ionomycin, which elevates intracellularCa2+ levels (14). Par-4 is up-regulated in the rat ventral prostateafter castration, and pretreatment of rats with the calcium chan-nel blocker nifedipine prevents castration-inducible Par-4 up-regulation as well as apoptosis and involution of the ventralprostate (14). In a cell type– and inducer-specific manner, Par-4expression is essential for apoptosis by cytokines, such as tumornecrosis factor (TNF) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand,which act via the death receptor signaling pathway, as well as bydoxorubicin, etoposide, UV irradiation, growth factor deprivation,and ionizing radiation, which act via the intrinsic mitochondrialpathway (15, 16). The exact point at which Par-4 converges onthese pathways is not yet delineated. Interestingly, ectopic Par-4selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normalcells, and this cancer-selective function is mediated by its centralcore domain designated as the SAC domain (17). Both proteinkinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, which results in the activation ofPar-4, and nuclear entry are essential for apoptosis by eitherectopic Par-4 or its SAC domain in cancer cells (18). Similar to thefindings with ectopic Par-4, endogenous Par-4 confers apoptosis bya mechanism that requires PKA phosphorylation of its T155residue as well as nuclear translocation for inhibition of NF-nBtranscription activity (18). Par-4 action may be also mediated byinteractions via its leucine zipper domain with partner proteins,Note: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online(http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/).Requests for reprints: Damodaran Chendil, Department of Clinical Sciences,College of Health Sciences, University of Kentucky, Room 124 E, 900 South LimestoneStreet, Lexington, KY 40536-0200.

Endo-genous Par-4, however, is phosphorylated and inactivated by AKTand sequestered by 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm (24), thereby explainingwhy cancer cells survive in the presence of endogenous Par-4.Our laboratory is interested in identifying natural agents withtherapeutic potential against cancer and preferably minimal toxi-city against normal cells. Because Par-4 induces cancer-selectiveapoptosis, we screened a panel of natural dietary compounds forPar-4 induction to identify compounds with apoptotic potential inprostate cancer cells. Our studies identified withaferin A (WA), amajor constituent of the medicinal plant Withania somnifera , asthe only compound in this panel that induced Par-4 expression inprostate cancer cells. The crystal structure of WA indicates thatit is a highly oxygenated C-28 ergostane-type steroid with a 22,26-lactone and a 1-oxo-group (25). The ethnobotanical history ofWA-containing herbal preparations in the treatment of cancer,inflammatory conditions (26, 27), and neurologic disorders (28),and the growth-inhibitory properties in tumor cell culture studies(29–31) prompted us to determine the mechanism of action of WAin prostate cancer cells. Our results suggest that WA inducesapoptosis of prostate cancer cells and that this action is dependenton Par-4 function in both androgen-responsive and androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells.Materials and MethodsCell lines, plasmid constructs, and small interfering RNA duplexes.PC-3, LNCaP, and PzHPV-7 cells were purchased from American TypeCulture Collection (Manassas, VA). The highly aggressive LNCaP-derivativeLN3 cells were from Curtis Pettaway (The University of Texas M.D.Anderson Cancer Center, Dallas, Houston, TX). CWR22RV-1 cells werekindly provided by Dr. Michael Sramkoski (Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland, OH). PC-3 and CWR22Rv-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); LNCaP and LN-3 cellswere grown in DMEM supplemented with glutamine in 10% FBS andantibiotics; and PzHPV-7 cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-freemedium from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). In experiments thatexamined the role of dihydrotestosterone and AR in WA action, theandrogen-responsive cells were grown in 10% charcoal stripped–serumcontaining medium lacking phenol red in the presence of dihydrotestoster-one (Sigma Chemical). The small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotideduplexes for human Par-4, mouse Par-4, AR, or scrambled control werefrom Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette,CO). Human and mouse Par-4 show >85%similarity at the amino acid level. Importantly, all critical domains,especially those involved in the induction of apoptosis, are conserved inhuman and mouse Par-4. The human Par-4 siRNA sequence targetshuman Par-4 RNA at an area that shows maximal divergence from mousePar-4; accordingly, only 11 of 19 nucleotides are similar in human andmouse Par-4 siRNA. The human Par-4 siRNA inhibits human Par-4,whereas the mouse Par-4 siRNA does not inhibit human Par-4, asconfirmed by previous studies (24). Therefore, mouse Par-4 siRNA wasused as a control in the studies done in PC-3 and CWR22Rv1 cells. Thewild-type (WT) AR expression construct was from Gerhard Coetzee(University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The Par-4 promoter-luciferase construct contained f2 kb of human Par-4 promoter regionupstream of the first ATG codon (Genbank accession no. AF541923) todrive luciferase expression in pGL3 (vector from Pierce Biotechnology,Rockford, IL).Natural dietary compounds, caspase inhibitors, or AR inhibitors.Natural agents, such as curcumin (polyphenol from turmeric; ref. 32),epigallocatechin-3-gallate (polyphenol from green tea; ref. 33), lycopene(carotenoid from tomato; ref. 34), and resveratrol (phytoalexin fromgrape skin; ref. 35), were from Sigma Chemical; psoralidin (coumestanderivative found in the seed of Psoralea corylifolia ; ref. 36) was isolatedfrom Rasagenthi lehyam (37) and its purity and structure was confirmedby high-pressure liquid chromatography; and WA, genistein (isoflavonefrom soy beans; ref. 38), gingerol (vanilloid from ginger; ref. 39),plumbagin (naphthoquinone from the Plumbaginaceae and Drosereceaegroup of plants; ref. 40), rutin (bioflavanoid from the buckwheat plantFagopyrum esculentum ; ref. 41), and diosgenin (steroidal saponin fromfenugreek; ref. 42) were from Chromadex (Santa Ana, CA). Caspase-3inhibitor zDEVD-FMK was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).Androgen antagonist and hydroxyl flutamide were purchased from SigmaChemical. Based on initial optimization studies, we used 4 Amol/Lamounts of WA, 1 Amol/L flutamide, or 2 Amol/L WA in combinationwith 1 Amol/L flutamide or 2 Amol/L Casodex.Cell viability and apoptotic assays. Cells were treated with WA orvehicle (DMSO) for 12 or 24 h, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or apoptotic assays [Annexin V-FITCor terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling(TUNEL)] were done as described previously (32, 37, 43).Western blot analysis. Cells were treated with WA (at the IC50concentration for each cell line based on initial optimization studies) forvarious time intervals, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blotanalysis using antibodies for Par-4, Bcl-2, and AR from Santa CruzBiotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved (active) caspase-8 and cleaved(active) caspase-3 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); or h-actin from SigmaChemical as a loading control.Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cellsafter the indicated treatments using Trizol (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO).The RNA (1 Ag) was subjected to reverse transcription using the avianmyeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase kit from Roche (Indianapolis, IN).Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by PCR using the forward primer(5¶-GGCACACCTGGGAGCCGGATCC-3¶) and the reverse primer (5¶-CGCA-GCTTCCTCTTCTCGATCT-3¶) for Par-4 and the GC-RICH PCR kit fromRoche to amplify the products. PCR amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was similarly done as a controlusing 5¶-AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3¶ and 5¶-CAGGGATGATGTT-CTGGAGAGC-3¶ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Theoptimized thermal cycling conditions were 95jC for 5 min followed by28 cycles of amplification at 55jC, 68jC, and 95jC, each for 1 min.PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, stainedwith ethidium bromide, and documented by photography. Nucleotidesequencing of the PCR products was done at the University of California(Davis, CA).Transient transfection and luciferase assays. Prostate cancer cells (at80-90% confluency) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plusreagents (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with 4 Ag of either the Par-4promoter-luciferase construct or the NF-nB-luciferase construct (containingtwo tandem NF-nB-responsive sites) in the presence of h-galactosidasecontrol or vector containing Renilla luciferase to normalize for transfectionefficiency as described previously (17). Transfected cells were treated withWA or vehicle (DMSO) as indicated, and the cells were harvested after24 h for luciferase or h-galactosidase activity assays.Xenograft studies. We tested the effect of WA on tumors derived fromPC-3 cells in 5 to 6 week male nude (nu/nu) mice ( from Charles RiverLaboratories, Wilmington, MA), in accordance with the University ofKentucky Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. About 5  106 cellswere injected s.c. into 20 animals, and tumors were allowed to grow untilthey reached a volume of 50 mm3. At this time, the animals wererandomized into two groups, with 10 mice in each group, and WA (5 mg/kgbody weight, dissolved in DMSO and diluted by PBS) or same amount ofDMSO was dissolved in PBS given intratumorally 5 days a week for up to 4weeks. WA dose was determined based on our initial optimization ofexperiments in mice. Tumor volume was measured daily over theobservation period.Immunocytochemical analysis. PC-3 cells, grown in chamber slides,were treated with WA and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence foractive forms of caspase-8 and caspase-3 or for Par-4 using primaryantibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

(Eugene, OR) was used to detect theprimary antibody. Immunocytochemical with normal rabbit antibody wasused as a control. For protein localization, nuclei were stained withpropidium iodide or 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI)for 20 min after cell fixation.Fluorometry for caspase-3 activation. Caspase activation wasanalyzed using the ApoAlert caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit according tothe manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Cell lysateswere treated with caspase-3 inhibitor and reaction buffer, and afterincubation for 30 min on ice, caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-AFC) was addedand incubated for 1 h at 37jC. The samples were transferred to96-well plates and read in a fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of400 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm. Nonconjugated AFC suppliedwith the kit was used to construct the calibration curve, and the caspase-3activity was read against the calibration curve.Statistical analysis. All experiments were done at least thrice toascertain the reproducibility of the results. The data shown arerepresentative of three experiments. The apoptosis data shown are a meanof four readings from each of the three experiments (total of 12 readings)FSD error bars. The Student’s t test was used to calculate statisticalsignificance.ResultsScreening purified components of natural dietary prod-ucts for Par-4 induction. As Par-4 is induced exclusively byapoptotic insults, and not during growth stimulation, growtharrest, or necrosis (14), and the elevation of Par-4 expressioninduces p53- and PTEN-independent apoptosis of cancer cellsand tumor regression (44, 45), we developed a cell-based assayusing Par-4 expression as a molecular indicator to screen fornatural dietary compounds with apoptotic potential. The AR-negative (androgen refractory) prostate cancer cells, PC-3, whichlack p53 and PTEN function and are sensitive to apoptosis byPar-4 (17), were transfected with either the Par-4 promoter-luciferase reporter construct or the control pGL3-luciferaseconstruct lacking the Par-4 promoter to test a panel of naturaldietary compounds for induction of Par-4. The transfectants weretreated with either vehicle (DMSO) or various natural dietarycompounds for 6 h, and induction of the Par-4 promoter wasanalyzed by luciferase assays. As seen in Fig. 1A , luciferaseactivity was induced by the Par-4 promoter in response to WA,not plumbagin (5 Amol/L), diosgenin (10 nmol/L), genistein(30 Amol/L), rutin (60 Amol/L), psoralidin (15 Amol/L), gingerol(40 Amol/L), curcumin (4 Amol/L), resveratrol (1 Amol/L), lyco-pene (1 Amol/L), or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (30 Amol/L). Incontrast, WA did not induce luciferase activity in cells transfectedwith the pGL3 control vector (data not shown). To verify inductionof endogenous Par-4 by WA, parental PC-3 cells were treated withthe various compounds for 12 or 24 h, and whole-cell lysates wereexamined for Par-4 expression by Western blot analysis. As seenin Fig. 1B , Par-4 expression was induced by WA, but not by theother compounds. Thus, the Par-4 reporter assay was effective inidentifying WA as a prospective natural product that may regulateapoptosis via Par-4.Figure 1. Par-4 expression is up-regulatedby WA. A, PC-3 cells were transfectedwith the Par-4 promoter-luciferase reporterconstruct and the h-galactosidaseconstruct and treated with various naturaldietary compounds at their respective IC50dose or vehicle for 6 h, and cell lysateswere subjected to luciferase activityassays. The doses used were the following:5 Amol/L plumbagin, 10 nmol/L diosgenin,30 Amol/L genistein, 60 Amol/L rutin,15 Amol/L psoralidin, 40 Amol/Lgingerol, 4 Amol/L curcumin, 1 Amol/Lresveratrol, 1 Amol/L lycopene, 35 Amol/Lepigallocatechin-3-gallate, and 4 Amol/LWA. Relative luciferase activity normalizedwith respect to the correspondingh-galactosidase activity. B, PC-3 cellswere treated with various natural dietarycompounds or vehicle for 12 or 24 h,and whole-cell lysates were subjected toWestern blot analysis for Par-4 or actin.C, PC-3 cells were treated with vehicle orWA (IC50 dose of 4 Amol/L) for the indicatedtime intervals, and whole-cell lysates weresubjected to Western blot analysis forPar-4 or actin.

D, PC-3 cells weretransfected with either the Par-4 promoter-luciferase (Par-4 promoter-luc ) reporterconstruct or pGL3-luciferase (pGL3-luc )control vector and h-galactosidaseconstruct. The transfectants were thentreated with WA or vehicle for 3 or 6 h, andcell lysates were subjected to luciferaseactivity assay.

As seenin Fig. 1C , WA up-regulated Par-4 within 3 h of treatment andmaximal up-regulation was seen at 24 h. Next, to ascertain thatPar-4 is up-regulated by WA at the RNA and promoter level,PC-3 cells were treated with WA (4 Amol/L), and RNA from thecells was examined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).Alternatively, cells were transiently transfected with either thePar-4 promoter-luciferase reporter or control pGL3-luciferaseconstruct and treated with WA (4 Amol/L), and lysates wereharvested for luciferase assays. RT-PCR analysis indicates thatWA caused up-regulation of Par-4 RNA relative to the GAPDHcontrol in PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistently,robust induction of Par-4 promoter activity by WA relative tovehicle-treated cells was noted (Fig. 1D). Together, these findingsindicate that WA consistently up-regulates Par-4 expression inPC-3 cells.WA induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To determinewhether WA inhibited prostate cancer cell survival, we did cellviability assays. Prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU145 (both ofwhich lack AR), PC-3 transfectants stably expressing ectopicWT AR (PC-3/AR), prostate cancer cells LNCaP and CWR22Rv-1(both of which express AR mutant), and normal/immortalizedprostate cancer cells PzHPV-7 were treated with various con-centrations of WA for 24 h, and cell viability was quantified. WAcaused significant inhibition of cell viability in the androgen-refractory PC-3 and DU145 cells relative to the AR-transfected PC-3/AR cells, LNCaP or CWR22Rv-1 (androgen responsive) prostatecancer cells, and immortalized PzHPV-7 cells (Fig. 2A). To resolvewhether inhibition of cell viability by WA was a consequence ofapoptosis, we treated PC-3, CWR22Rv-1, and PzHPV-7 cells withWA for 24 h and measured apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 2B , WAinduced significant dose-dependent apoptosis in PC-3 cellsrelative to CWR22Rv-1 cells and PzHPV-7 cells. Moreover, WAinduced time-dependent apoptosis over a 24-h period in PC-3cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and also translocated Par-4 to thenucleus (Supplementary Fig. S3). Together, these findings suggestthat WA causes apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancercells.To ascertain the effect of WA on prostate tumor growth, wetested the effect of WA on PC-3 xenografts in nude mice. Theanimals were injected intratumorally with WA or vehicle andtumor volumes were measured up to 4 weeks after the injections.As seen in Fig. 2C , tumors injected with vehicle continued to grow,whereas tumors injected with WA showed significant (P < 0.001)growth inhibition. Importantly, the WA-treated tumors failed toregrow during the 8-week observation period. When sections of thetumors were tested for Par-4 expression and apoptosis, asignificant number of cells in the WA-treated tumors showedPar-4 up-regulation (Supplementary Fig. S4) and apoptosis (Fig. 2C,inset) relative to vehicle-treated tumors. Thus, WA causedinduction of Par-4 expression, apoptosis, and regression ofexperimental tumors.Role of Par-4 in the apoptotic action of WA. To determinewhether Par-4 induction was causally involved in the apoptoticaction of WA, we knocked down Par-4 expression in PC-3 cellsby using human Par-4 siRNA and then treated the cells withvehicle or WA for 24 h. Cells transfected with mouse Par-4siRNA or vector alone were used as control. The effect of Par-4Figure 2. WA induces apoptosis by aPar-4–dependent mechanism.A, androgen-responsive (AR mutant)prostate cancer cells (LNCaP andCWR22Rv-1), androgen-refractory (ARnegative) prostate cancer cells (PC-3 andDU-145), PC-3 cells transfected with WTAR (PC-3/AR ), and a normal prostateepithelial cell line (PzHPV-7) were treatedwith various concentrations of WA for 24 h,and the cell viability was measured byMTT assay.

Importantly, we notedthat WA-inducible apoptosis was inhibited in cells transfectedwith human Par-4 siRNA but not in cells transfected withcontrol mouse Par-4 siRNA (Fig. 2D, top). Moreover, transfectionwith dominant-negative Par-4 abrogated WA-inducible apoptosisin PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results indicate thatPar-4 is essential for WA-inducible apoptosis.WA induces caspase signaling and inhibits NF-KB activity bya Par-4–dependent pathway. In studies aimed at identifying thedownstream signaling pathways involved in WA-inducible apopto-sis of PC-3 cells, we noted that WA caused the activation ofcaspase-3, as judged by immunocytochemical fluorometry assays(Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, inhibition of caspase-3 activityby zDEVD-FMK led to inhibition of WA-inducible apoptosis(Fig. 3A), implying that caspase-3 activation was essential forWA-inducible apoptosis. Interestingly, Western blot analysis forPar-4 in cells treated with WA and the caspase-3 inhibitor indicatedthat WA induces Par-4 expression despite inhibition of caspase-3,implying that Par-4 induction occurs upstream of caspase-3activation in the apoptotic pathway induced by WA. Furtherimmunocytochemical studies indicated that WA induces theactivation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 3B). To determine therole of Par-4 in caspase activation, we knocked down endogenousPar-4 in PC-3 cells using either human Par-4 siRNA or mouse Par-4siRNA for control, treated the cells with WA, and did immunocy-tochemical for activated caspase-8 or caspase-3. As seen in Fig. 3B ,siRNA for human Par-4, but not mouse Par-4, prevented theactivation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 by WA. These results indicatethat Par-4 induction is necessary for caspase-8 and caspase-3activation by WA in PC-3 cells.Because Par-4-inducible apoptosis involves inhibition of bothNF-nB transcription activity (44) and downstream targets ofNF-nB, including Bcl-2 (46), we examined whether WA regu-lated NF-nB activation and Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, WAinhibited NF-nB-dependent luciferase activity (SupplementaryFig. S7) and caused down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (Supple-mentary Fig. S8) in PC-3 cells. To determine whether Par-4 functionwas essential for inhibition of NF-nB signaling, we knocked downPar-4 expression in PC-3 cells by using Par-4 siRNA, transfected thecells with the NF-nB-luciferase construct, treated the cells with WA,and did luciferase assays for NF-nB activity and Western blotanalysis for Bcl-2 expression. WA failed to inhibit NF-nB activity(Fig. 3C) and Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 3D) in cells where Par-4expression was knocked down with human Par-4 siRNA but notwhen Par-4 levels were unaffected with mouse or control Par-4siRNA. These findings imply that Par-4 function is necessary forFigure 3. Caspase activation andinhibition of cell survival signaling by WA isPar-4 dependent. A, PC-3 cells weretreated with caspase-3 inhibitorzDEVD-FMK and then exposed to WAor vehicle for 24 h.

As WAinduced apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells, butnot in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells, we sought todirectly address whether AR modulates sensitivity to WA. PC-3 cellswere transfected with an expression construct for either WT AR orcontrol vector, and AR expression was verified by Western blotanalysis (Fig. 4A). The transfectants were then treated with WA andscored for apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4A , WA-inducible Par-4expression and apoptosis were significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) intransfectants expressing WT AR relative to those expressing thecontrol vector, suggesting that AR may confer resistance toapoptosis by WA.Next, we determined the role of AR in resistance to WA-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells that express endoge-nous AR (i.e., androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells CWR22Rv-1,LNCaP, and LN-3). First, we asked whether inhibition of ARsignaling with anti-androgen could render CWR22Rv-1 cellssusceptible to WA-inducible apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4B , neitheranti-androgen ( flutamide) nor WA caused apoptosis in theandrogen refractory prostate cancer cells. However, the combina-tion of anti-androgen and WA caused significant induction ofapoptosis in the cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Western blot analysisindicated that neither WA nor anti-androgen induced Par-4expression (Fig. 4B); however, the combination of anti-androgenand WA down-regulated AR and up-regulated Par-4 expression inthe AR-mutant cells.We also knocked down AR expression in CWR22Rv-1 cells withAR siRNA to directly validate the role of AR in Par-4 induction andsensitivity to WA-mediated apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4C , WA up-regulated Par-4 expression and induced apoptosis in CWR22Rv-1cells transfected with AR siRNA but not in cells transfected withcontrol siRNA. It is important to note that WA induces ARexpression in CWR22Rv-1 cells, which in turn down-regulatesPar-4 expression. This may be the reason for the resistance of theCWR22Rv-1 cells to WA. These results indicate that AR signalingprevents Par-4 induction and apoptosis by WA; therefore,inhibition of AR signaling restores Par-4 induction and sensitivityto WA.Finally, we sought to determine whether Par-4 function wasessential for induction of apoptosis by the combination of WA andflutamide in androgen-responsive cells. CWR22Rv-1 cells weretransfected with either human Par-4 siRNA or mouse Par-4 siRNAand then treated with either the combination of flutamide and WAor vehicle. Inhibition of endogenous Par-4 with human Par-4siRNA, but not with mouse siRNA, was confirmed by Western blotanalysis (Fig. 4D). When the cells were scored for apoptosis, wenoted that the combination of flutamide and WA inducedapoptosis in cells transfected with mouse Par-4 siRNA but not inFigure 4.

January 1, 2007Research. on May 1, 2019. © 2007 American Association for Cancercancerres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from Published OnlineFirst December 21, 2006; DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2430 cells transfected with human Par-4 siRNA (Fig. 4D ; SupplementaryFig. S9). Together, these findings suggest that inhibition of ARsignaling facilitates Par-4–dependent apoptosis of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells.DiscussionOur findings suggest that WA preferentially induces apoptosis inandrogen-refractory prostate cancer cells but not in androgen-responsive (WT AR or AR mutant) prostate cancer cells and nor-mal/immortalized prostate epithelial cells. Interestingly, treatmentof androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells with anti-androgens( flutamide and Casodex; data not shown), which on their own donot cause apoptosis, rendered the cells amenable to apoptosis byWA. Apoptosis by WA required the up-regulation of Par-4expression for inhibition of NF-nB activity and for activation ofthe caspase cascade. Thus, this study identified, for the first time,the mechanism of apoptosis by WA. Moreover, our findingsindicate that despite AR-mutation, prostate cancer cells areresponsive to AR signaling, which sustains cell survival even inthe presence of anti-androgens, and that a combination of WA andanti-androgens can synergistically induce Par-4 expression andapoptosis. Because androgen depletion independence is a criticaldeterminant of aggressive prostate cancer that is refractory toconventional treatment, our findings provide new insight for thetreatment of such tumors using a combinatorial approach withnatural compounds, such as WA, which may work synergisticallywith anti-androgens to inhibit cell survival.As Par-4 is induced exclusively by apoptotic agents (14), we usedthe Par-4 promoter construct to screen a panel of natural productsfor apoptotic activity in cancer cells. Moreover, mutations in thePar-4 gene have not been reported in cancer cells, but the proteinis rendered inactive by binding and phosphorylation by Akt activity,which is elevated in cancer cells (24). Par-4 function is essential forthe induction of apoptosis by a broad range of agents, implyingthat endogenous Par-4 must be activated in response to theseapoptotic agents (16). Two potential modes of Par-4 activation arethe following: (a) up-regulation of Par-4 above the necessarythresholds to override inhibition by Akt, translocate Par-4 to thenucleus, and induce apoptosis (45) and (b) inhibition of Akt torelease Par-4 for apoptosis (24). Our studies indicate that, from thecompounds tested in this screen, only WA was able to induce Par-4expression. Several other compounds from this panel have beenreported in the literature to cause either growth-inhibitory orapoptotic effects in cancer cells, yet these compounds did notinduce Par-4 expression. Apparently, these compounds induceapoptosis either by inhibiting Akt activity to release active Par-4 forapoptosis or by triggering a Par-4–independent mechanism. Ourongoing studies are poised to address the mechanism of prostatecancer cell apoptosis by the natural compounds that did notinduce Par-4 expression. As Par-4 can induce apoptosis in theabsence of p53 or PTEN function, both of which are often lost incancer, our findings using the Par-4 reporter can be extended tohigh-throughput screens of natural compounds and small mole-cules for their anticancer/apoptotic potential. Most importantly,because ectopic Par-4 expression induces apoptosis exclusively incancer cells and not in normal cells, the ideal compoundsidentified in the Par-4 reporter assays would preferentially inducePar-4–dependent apoptosis without activating other apoptoticpathways that would compromise cancer cell selectivity andconsequently induce toxicity in normal cells. In the present study,WA failed to induce apoptosis in immortalized prostate epithelialcells, except at very high toxic doses. However, further studies usinga broad panel of cell lines and in vivo models are essential todetermine whether WA shows differential effects in normal andcancer cells.Although several previous reports have described the growth-inhibitory potential of WA, the present study shows for the firsttime that WA inhibits cell viability by inducing apoptosis.Moreover, the mechanism of apoptosis involves induction of Par-4,activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and inhibition of theprosurvival activity of NF-nB. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Par-4results in abrogation of WA-inducible caspase activation andinhibition of NF-nB activity, thereby positioning Par-4 induction byWA as an essential event upstream of caspase activation and NF-nBinhibition. Thus, WA, acting via induction of endogenous Par-4,activates a caspase-8- and caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathwayin prostate cancer cells.AR function is integrally linked to prostate cancer progression.Initially, androgen independence was believed to be a conse-quence of AR loss, but it is now apparent that AR is expressedin hormone-refractory prostate cancer. There is a growingconsensus, therefore, that the lack of responsiveness to anti-androgen therapy is a function of either enhanced sensitivity ofAR to androgen levels (owing to mutations) or post-translationalalterations in AR (13). Accordingly, both androgen-responsive orandrogen-refractory prostate cancer cells have been identified inclinical specimens as well as in cell lines derived and establishedfrom advanced prostate cancer, as exemplified by the AR-negative PC-3 and DU145 cells and the LNCaP and CWR22Rv-1(AR mutant) cells. Our findings suggest that, similar to AR-negative cells, AR-mutant cells, in which AR expression isknocked down by RNAi or AR signaling is ablated by anti-androgens, allow WA to induce Par-4. By contrast, AR-mutantcells with functionally active AR signaling do not allow WA toinduce apoptosis. These findings on the suppression of Par-4expression by AR signaling are consistent with our previousobservation that castration, which depletes androgen and ARsignaling, causes induction of Par-4 in the rat ventral prostateand that implantation of testosterone pellets prevents Par-4induction following castration (47). Thus, AR signaling inhibitsPar-4 induction by WA. Further studies should uncover theproximal events responsible for induction of the Par-4 promoterby WA and its suppression by AR signaling.Most prostate tumors initially respond to androgen ablationtherapy but later convert to androgen depletion-independentgrowth. At this advanced stage, AR inhibitors fail to functioneffectively, leaving little to no recourse for the patient. Because ARimpedes the action of WA, but a combination of anti-androgensand WA induces apoptosis in androgen-independent prostatecancer cells, our studies underscore the significance of screeningnew compounds to identify synergistic combinations for prostatecancer therapy.AcknowledgmentsReceived 7/3/2006; revised 9/22/2006; accepted 10/13/2006.Grant support: Department of Defense, University of Kentucky ResearchFoundation, and American Cancer Society grants (D.
