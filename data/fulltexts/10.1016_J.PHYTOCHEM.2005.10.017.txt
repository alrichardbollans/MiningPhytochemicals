IntroductionHypericum perforatum L. (St. Johns wort) is a medicinalplant used all over the world. Extract of HP is widely usedto treat mild to moderate depression. The eﬃcacy of theextract has been supported by some pharmacological andclinical studies (Erdelmeyer et al., 2000; Izzo and Ernst,2003; Butterweck, 2003), attracting the interest of pharma-ceutical industries. Presently, HP is one of the leadingmedicinal herbs sold both in EU and in USA (Erdelmeyeret al., 2000).The growing demand for HP-derived products and theirphytochemical consistency lead the producers to utilize thebiomass of cultivated plants instead of wild collection.Nowadays, HP cultivation covers several hundred hectaresin Europe (Gaudin et al., 2003).

One of the main problems concerning the long-termcultivation of HP is the fungal disease anthracnose causedby Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Gaudin et al., 2003).This pathogen is responsible for heavy losses in HP planta-tions by lowering yield and modifying the chemical compo-sition of the plant extracts. Several eﬀorts have been takento obtain HP plants resistant to anthracnose. Nevertheless,little is known about the defence responses of this plantagainst pathogen attack. Diﬀerential accumulation ofhyperforin and hypericin after elicitation of H. perforatumplantlets with C. gloeosporioides was reported (Gibson andSirvent, 2002).Plant cell cultures of several species have been utilized,successfully as models to study the biochemical changesrelated to plant defence responses against pathogens(Hagemeier et al., 1999; Conrath et al., 2002; Hahlbrocket al., 2003). This system is relatively easy to manipulateand provide a better control of external factors that caninterfere with the metabolic activities and thus advanta-geous over in vivo plant–pathogen interaction.150 L.F.R. Conceic¸a˜o et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 149–155Here, we report the utilization of HP cell suspension cul-tures as a tool to study the defence responses related tophenolic metabolism against C. gloeosporioides attack2. Results2.1. Phenolic proﬁles of non-elicited and elicitedH. perforatum culturesFig. 1(a) shows a typical HPLC proﬁle of the phenolicsproduced by HP cell cultures (control). A major group ofcompounds were putatively identiﬁed as xanthone deriva-tives with 1,3,6,7 oxygenation pattern based on their char-acteristic UV spectra previously (Dias et al., 2000, 2001). Amajor xanthone (compound X1) was putatively identiﬁedas mangiferin. HPLC–MS/MS analysis of this compoundgave a molecular ion m/z [M  H] of 421.5 and major –MS2 fragments at m/z 331.0 [M  H  90] and 301.2[M  H  120], losses characteristics of C-hexosyl com-pounds (Cuyckens et al., 2001). HPLC–DAD–MS/MScomparison analysis with a commercial standard of mang-iferin (Extrasynthe`se, Genay, France) conﬁrmed this iden-tiﬁcation. Xanthones X7 and X10 were identiﬁed as 1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-8-prenylxanthone (molecular ionm/z [M  H] of 341.5) and c-mangostin (molecular ionm/z [M  H] of 395.5), respectively, by HPLC–DADand HPLC–MS–MS comparisons with pure compoundspreviously isolated from Hypericum androsaemum cell cul-tures (Dias et al., 2000). Several other minor compoundswere categorized as 1,3,6,7-xanthone derivatives byHPLC–DAD–MS/MS analysis, but not fully identiﬁed.A second set of phenolics (F2–F4) produced by HP cellcultures were identiﬁed as ﬂavonols based on their charac-teristic UV spectra. An intense deprotonated ion of theaglycone (m/z 300.2) was observed for these compoundsindicating that they are quercetin derivatives. CompoundsF2 and F3 contained similar deprotonated molecular ionm/z at 463.6 and a major –MS2 fragment at m/z 301.0, cor-responding to the loss of a hexoside residue from quercetinaglycone. Commercial standards (Extrasynthe`se, Genay,France) were used to conﬁrm the compound F2 as hypero-sid and F3 as isoquercetrin. Compound F4 shared similar-ity with F2 and F3 in UV-spectra indicating its quercetin3-derivative nature. It has a deprotonated molecular ionat m/z 505.2 and –MS2 fragments at m/z of 462.7[M  H  42] (quercetin 3-hexoside), that resulted fromthe loss of an acetyl group, and m/z of 301.0 (quercetinaglycone). According to its UV and mass spectra, this com-pound could be an acetyl derivative of hyperoside or iso-quercetrin, a compound recently identiﬁed in HP plants(Silva et al., 2005).HP cells primed with MeJ produced several compoundsthat were not detected in the control cells (Fig. 1(b), com-pounds F1, F5–F10). Compound F1 has shown a similarUV and MS–MS spectra (m/z of 463.8 and 301.0) to thoseof compounds F2 and F3 indicating that it is a quercetin-3-hexose derivative. Compounds F5–F10 were identiﬁed asﬂavone derivatives. Compounds F5 and F6 have a deproto-nated molecular ion at m/z 447.9, –MS2 fragment at m/z of285.7 (aglycone) and a similar UV spectra (267, 339). Theywere characterized tentatively as 6- and/or 8-OH-apigenin-7-hexosides based on their UV and MS–MS spectra.Compound F9 was identiﬁed as luteolin-C-prenyl byHPLC–DAD–MS/MS after comparison with pure com-pound previously isolated from H. androsaemum cell cul-tures (Dias et al., 1998). Compounds F7, F8 and F10were also assigned as luteolin derivatives due to their UVspectra (255, 277, 346) and the presence of an intense –MS2 fragment at m/z of 285.9. Cells primed only with SAdid not produce any new compounds.Several compounds were produced de novo in HP cul-tures when elicited with CG (Fig. 1(c)) mainly in those cellspreviously primed with MeJ (Fig. 1(d)). On perusal of theproﬁle of UV spectra, the compounds were identiﬁed as1,3,6,7 xanthone derivatives. Similar HPLC proﬁles wereobtained when the cultures were ﬁrst primed with SA andthen elicited with CG extract (results not shown). Com-pound X2 was identiﬁed as 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthoneaglicone (single intense molecular ion m/z [M  H] of259.9). Compound X3 was putatively identiﬁed as mangif-erin-C-prenyl. HPLC–MS/MS analysis of this compoundgave a molecular ion m/z [M  H] of 489.6 and major –MS2 fragments at m/z 399.1 [M  H  90] and 369.2[M  H  120], losses characteristics of C-hexosyl com-pounds (Cuyckens et al., 2001). Compound X4 gave amolecular ion m/z [M  H] of 517.7, major –MS2 frag-ments at m/z of 365.0 and an intense fragment at m/z of257.1 characterized it as a dimer of 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyx-anthone. Compounds X5 and X6 had an UV spectra char-acteristic of 1,3,6,7-oxygenated xanthones and molecularionm/z [M  H] of 326.9. So, these compounds were iden-tiﬁed as 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone-C-prenyl isomers.Compounds X8, X9 and X11 were putatively identiﬁed asisomers of c-mangostin (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone-C-bis-prenyl), since they have a similar molecular ion m/z[M  H] of 395.4 but diﬀerent UV spectra and retentiontimes. Several minor compounds were also identiﬁed as1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone derivatives but their identiﬁ-cation was not fully accomplished.2.2. Diﬀerential accumulation of phenolics due to MeJ andSA priming and CG elicitationFig. 2 shows the accumulation of major phenolic groupsafter 24 h of CG elicitation in seven days old HP suspen-sion cultures.HP suspension cultures elicited with the fungal elicitorshowed a signiﬁcant increase (seven fold) in xanthone accu-mulation. This burst was due to an increased production ofusual xanthones (like X7 and X10) as well as the synthesisof new ones (Fig. 1(c)). This eﬀect was particularly notice-able when the cells were primed with MeJ prior to elicita-tion with CG (Fig. 1(d)). In this condition, totalFig. 1.

Results aremeans (±SD) of six independent replicates from two independentexperiences. The straight arrow indicates the addition of SA or MeJ,and the dotted arrow indicates addition of fungal elicitor.152 L.F.R. Conceic¸a˜o et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 149–155xanthone content increased approximately twelve timeswhen compared to the control (Fig. 2). Addition of SAalone to HP cultures also increased xanthone accumulationsigniﬁcantly (P < 0.05).Flavonoids accumulation in HP suspension cultures wasalso changed considerably after priming and elicitation pro-cedures (Fig. 2). Flavonoids were not detected in cellsexposed only to the fungal elicitor. Accumulation of thesecompounds decreased in the cells primedwithMeJ or SA fol-lowed by CG elicitation (P < 0.05). HP suspension culturesexposed only to MeJ produced a new class of ﬂavonoids,the ﬂavones (Fig. 2). Flavones represent a signiﬁcant pro-portion (approx. 40%) of the total ﬂavonoids accumulatedin those cells. Interestingly, in this condition, the total accu-mulation of ﬂavonoids (ﬂavonols plus ﬂavones) did notchange signiﬁcantly from the control (P > 0.05).In spite of the signiﬁcant changes in the accumulation ofdiﬀerent phenolic classes, the total amount of phenolicsproduced by MeJ and SA-elicited cells was not statisticallydiﬀerent to that of the control. However, cells elicited withCG elicitor produced a higher amount of phenols, mainlydue to the increase in xanthone accumulation (Fig. 2).2.3. Time course changes of phenolic accumulation in cellsdue to MeJ and SA priming and CG elicitationThe elicitation process also induced signiﬁcant changesin the phenols accumulated by the cells throughout the cul-ture period (Fig. 3). HPLC analysis of the cell culture med-ium did not show any traces of phenolics at any stage of theculture. Moreover, cell viability remained high (around90%) in all the tested conditions. Apparently, the phenolicsproduced were either accumulated or metabolized intra-cellularly. Similar results have been described for the accu-mulation of xanthones in Centaurium species (Beerhuesand Berger, 1995).In the cell suspensions elicited only with MeJ, xanthoneaccumulation remained constant throughout the cultureperiod (Fig. 3). However, cells elicited with SA onlyshowed a signiﬁcant increase in xanthone production withculture period (P < 0.05).Xanthone level of HP cells primed with MeJ reached themaximum in 24 h after the addition of CG elicitor (Fig. 3).Cell suspensions treated with fungal elicitor with or with-out SA priming attained the highest xanthone accumula-tion only after 72 h of elicitor addition. After day 9, theamount of xanthones started decreasing gradually. By theday 12, control and cells elicited with CG elicitor producedthe same amount of xanthones. However, cells primed withMeJ and SA prior to fungal elicitor addition have retainedthe higher xanthone level even after 12 days (Fig. 3).MeJ and SA addition to the suspension signiﬁcantlydecreased the accumulation of ﬂavonols in HP cells atL.F.R. Conceic¸a˜o et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 149–155 153the end of the culture period (Fig. 3). Flavonols accumula-tion in HP suspension cultures were negatively aﬀected bythe addition of CG elicitor, resulting in their rapid disap-pearance throughout the culture time. It is interesting tomention that this disappearance coincided with the onsetof xanthone production (Fig. 3).Addition of MeJ to HP cells induced the synthesis of anew group of phenolic compounds, the ﬂavones, whichaccumulated during the ﬁrst 48 h after MeJ addition andsubsequently declined (Fig. 3). Addition of the fungal elic-itor to those cells resulted in a fall of ﬂavone levels untilthey could no longer be detected after 72 h.3. DiscussionIn the presence of a pathogen, plants develop a vastarray of metabolic defence responses sequentially activatedin a complex multicomponent network that may be localand/or systemic (Hahlbrock et al., 2003). Defenceresponses to pathogen infection include the production ofseveral secondary metabolites such as phenolics (Dixonand Paiva, 1995; Dixon, 2001; Tan et al., 2004).In the present study, HP cell suspension cultures devel-oped a diﬀerential phenolic response upon CG elicitationwhich includes an increase in xanthone accumulation andthe production of new constituents (Fig. 1(c)). Beerhuesand Berger (1995) already observed an increase in the accu-mulation of new xanthones in the cultures of Centauriumsp., upon elicitation with yeast but not with the cell wallpreparations of various pathogenic fungi. Xanthones areknown for their pharmacological activities (Hostettmannand Hostettmann, 1989) such as antibacterial and anti-fun-gal (Beerhues et al., 2000; Braz-Filho, 1999). In addition,xanthones produced by H. androsaemum cell cultures haveshown to inhibit the growth of Candida utillis and Saccha-romyces cerevisae (Dias, 2003). In the present study, HPcell cultures elicited with fungal elicitor accumulated a sig-niﬁcant amount of mangostin, a xanthone known to dis-play anti-fungal activity (Hostettmann and Hostettmann,1989). Moreover, a major part of the xanthones accumu-lated after elicitation have an non-polar nature which ren-ders higher antimicrobial activity to the compounds.Therefore, the increase in xanthone accumulation observedin HP cells can be described as a defence response triggeredby some of the components present in the fungal elicitor. Itis known that several fungal products such as proteins, gly-coproteins or oligosaccharides can trigger the defencemechanisms in plants (Dmitriev, 2003).The increase of xanthone accumulation observed in HPcultures after the treatment with fungal elicitor could be thereason why ﬂavonols became undetectable after elicitation(Fig. 1(c) and (d)). It is known that xanthones and ﬂavo-noids are biosynthetically related compounds, sharing apool of precursors (Schro¨der, 1997; Dias, 2003; Liu et al.,2003). Those precursors could have been shifted for thexanthones biosynthesis in detriment to the ﬂavonoid path-way resulting in a too low ﬂavonol production to detect byHPLC.Plant defence can be triggered by local recognition ofpathogens but, more eﬀective responses include systemicsignalling pathways (Conrath et al., 2002). Two of the mostimportant compounds having this ability are salicylic acid(SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Systemic responses includethose dependent on SA signalling and are named SystemicAcquired Resistance (Dempsey et al., 1999). The InducedSystemic Resistance is known to be dependent on JA (Feysand Parker, 2000). SA, JA and its derivatives like MeJ havebeen used as inducers in plants and were found to stimulatetheir secondary metabolism (Hahlbrock et al., 2003;Thomma et al., 2000). For this reason we evaluated the pos-sible eﬀects of those molecules on the phenolic compositionof HP cell suspensions. The overall increase in xanthoneproduction and the quick response of HP cells to the CGelicitor (Figs. 2 and 3) after the pre-treatment with MeJ orSA suggests that these molecules primed the HP cellsdefences. This faculty is known for a long time but progressin understanding is still scarce (Conrath et al., 2002). Theability of jasmonate to boost plant defences against fungalpathogens has already been reported (Thomma et al.,2000). The mechanism of action of SA and MeJ (or moregeneral, jasmonates) is still a mater of debate (Felton andKorth, 2000). These two compounds seem to act indepen-dently via antagonistic pathways giving rise to diﬀerentplant responses. Nevertheless, a clear dichotomy does notalways exist. In our case, both SA and MeJ were able toinduce the priming of the xanthone accumulation in HPcells, as a response to the fungal elicitation, at diﬀerent lev-els. However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed (Figs. 2and 3). SA was able to increment the production of xant-hones by itself, whereas MeJ alone did not interfere signif-icantly in xanthone biosynthesis but resulted in a selectiveaccumulation of ﬂavones. The physiological signiﬁcanceof this pattern is not clear but might indicate that SA andMeJ stimulate diﬀerent pathways in HP cells, independentlyof the result being the same: priming of the xanthone bio-synthesis due to fungal elicitation.The use of JA and SA in HP cell suspension was alreadyreported (Vivanco et al., 2002). The authors have observedthat the utilization of JA originated an increase in hyperi-cin production of HP cultures. On the contrary, thisresponse was not observed when SA or a pathogen extractwas used. The elicitation of HP plantlets with SA, MeJ andC. gloeosporioides resulted in a diﬀerential accumulation ofhyperforin and hypericin depending on the treatments(Gibson and Sirvent, 2002). Moreover, hypericin provedto inhibit the growth of C. gloeosporioides. Thus hyperforinand hypericin could be considered as presumptive phytoan-tecipins of HP. In our case, we did not observe the accumu-lation of either hypericin or hyperforin in HP cultures afterelicitation with CG, in agreement with previous studies(Dias, 2003). This could be due to the fact that compoundslike hypericins are accumulated in specialized tissues(glands) and not in cells of an undiﬀerentiated state.154 L.F.R. Conceic¸a˜o et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 149–155In conclusion, the accumulation of xanthones in HP cul-tures was strongly induced by CG elicitation especiallywhen primed with SA and, namely MeJ. The results indi-cate that these compounds could act as defence compoundsin HP cells, and eventually in in vivo plants. HP plants donot accumulate xanthones in signiﬁcant amounts at theaerial parts, with the exception of mangiferin (Kitanovand Nedialkov, 1998). Nevertheless, we detected otherxanthones in the biomass of HP plants occasionally(unpublished results). Taking in account the results pre-sented here, this could be due to a biotic stress suﬀeredby the plants in ﬁeld conditions. Further studies are neededto validate this thesis. Additionally, isolation of the majorxanthones produced by HP cells due to the elicitation pro-cess are ongoing, to test their potential activity againstC. gloeosporioides.4. Experimental4.1. MaterialsAll solvents (HPLC grade) were purchased from Merck(Darmstadt, Germany). Milli-Q water was generated bydeionization (Millipore, MA, USA). Chemicals (analyticalgrade) utilized in the study were obtained from Sigma (Bar-celona, Spain) except that of mangiferin and ﬂavonoidstandards which were supplied by Extrasynthe`se (Genay,France).4.2. Media and growth conditionsCell suspension cultures of HP were obtained and main-tained as described elsewhere (Dias et al., 2001). The cul-tures were incubated in 16-h light photoperiod,illuminated by ﬂuorescent light bulbs (Osram-Fluora) pro-viding a photon ﬂux of 30 lmol s1 m2. Each Erlenmeyerﬂask containing 70 ml MS liquid medium was inoculatedwith 10 ml of suspension at the late exponential phaseand kept on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm, at 25 C. Cellswere sub-cultured regularly to fresh medium once in every14 days.4.3. Fungal elicitor preparationCultures of C. gloeosporioides were maintained in potatodextrose agar (PDA) plates incubated in dark, at roomtemperature. Flasks containing modiﬁed liquid Mathursmedium (Freeman et al., 2000) were inoculated with 4–5PDA agar plugs containing young C. gloeosporioides myce-lium and kept in the dark at 25 C in a rotary shaker at250 rpm. Fully-grown liquid cultures were obtained 14days after inoculation. Biomass of C. gloeosporioides washarvested by ﬁltration, lyophilized for 48 h and crushedin a mortar. The crushed fungal biomass was put in water(20 mg dry wt/ml) and autoclaved at 120 C for 15 min.The resulting suspension was utilized as the fungal elicitor.4.4. Culture elicitationHP suspension cultures at the exponential phase weredivided in groups. One group of ﬂasks was kept as control.Two sets were treated on the 5th day of HP suspension cul-ture with a ﬁnal concentration of 100 and 25 lM of MeJand SA, respectively. The remaining groups were elicitedon the 6th day with the fungal elicitor. Two of those setswere primed with MeJ (100 lM) or SA (25 lM), 24 hbefore fungal elicitor addition. The ﬁnal concentration ofthe fungal biomass in the HP suspension cultures was0.25 g dry wt /l. The priming and elicitation procedureswere done in cells in the exponential phase, the growth per-iod at which they were more responsive to treatments. Cellssuspension culture samples were harvested by ﬁltration onthe 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th and 12th day of growth. The collectedsamples were lyophilized for 48 h and the biomass wasstored in closed containers at 20 C for further analyses.Each treatment contained three independent replicates andthe experiments were repeated twice.4.5. Cell viability analysisCell cultures were checked for their viability through outthe experiment using the tripan blue (Sigma, Barcelona).Brieﬂy, 0.1 ml cells suspension samples were mixed with0.1 ml of 0.4% tripan blue (prepared in MS medium) andincubated for 10 min. A part of the mixture after incuba-tion was transferred onto a glass slide and covered with acover slip. Cell viability was checked at light microscope.The percentage of cell viability for each sample was calcu-lated by counting the number of non-stained cells in rela-tion to the total cells at four diﬀerent locations of theglass slide, in at least three independent replicates.4.6. HPLC samples preparation and analysisDried HP biomass was extracted with an aqueous meth-anolic solution (90%) (at approximately 50 mg dry wt/ml),with sonication for 20 min, in the dark, at ambient temper-ature. An aqueous methanolic solution (90%) was used toextract the dried HP biomass (at approximately 50 mg drywt /ml) with sonication for 20 min in the dark at ambienttemperature. The liquid phase was ﬁltered and submittedto HPLC–DAD analysis as described before (Dias et al.,1999). Quantiﬁcation of the phenolic compounds was per-formed by the external standard method. Xanthones werequantiﬁed as mangiferin equivalents at 260 nm. Flavonolsand ﬂavones were quantiﬁed at 350 nm as quercetin andluteolin-7-glucoside equivalents, respectively. Phenols anal-ysis was also performed by HPLC–DAD–MS/MS asdescribed elsewhere (Silva et al., 2005).4.7. Statistical analysisAll the data were analysed by two-way analysis ofvariance test (ANOVA) with Bonferronis post-hoc test.L.F.R.
