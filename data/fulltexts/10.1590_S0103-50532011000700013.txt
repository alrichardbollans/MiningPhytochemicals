A purificação do extrato da raiz de Colubrina greggii var. yucatanensis levou ao isolamento 
e identificação do ácido 3-O-acetil ceanótico, um novo triterpeno natural, juntamente com os 
metabólitos já descritos: ácido ceanótico, ácido cenoténico, ácido betulínico, discarina B e 
crisofaneína. Os produtos naturais e os derivados semi-sintéticos éster de acetil dimetil ceanotato, 
dimetil ceanotato e peracetato de crisofaneína mostraram moderada a baixa atividade leishmanicida 
e tripanocida. Nenhum dos metabólitos mostrou ser citotóxicos ou ter atividade antiproliferativa. 
Os resultados também sugerem que o ácido betulínico contribui para a atividade antiplasmódica 
inicialmente detectada na raiz do extrato bruto de C. greggii var. yucatanensis.
Purification of the root extract of Colubrina greggii var. yucatanensis resulted in the isolation 
and identification of 3-O-acetyl ceanothic acid as a new natural ceanothane triterpene, together 
with the known metabolites ceanothic acid, cenothenic acid, betulinic acid, discarine B and 
chrysophanein. The natural products and the semisynthetic esters acetyl dimethyl ceanothate, 
dimethyl ceanothate and chrysophanein peracetate showed moderate to low leishmanicidal and 
trypanocidal activities. None of the metabolites showed cytotoxic or antiproliferative effects. 
The results also suggested that betulinic acid contributes to the antiplasmodial activity originally 
detected in the crude root extract of C. greggii var. yucatanensis.

Introduction
Leishmaniosis, trypanosomiosis and malaria are a group 
of protozoan diseases considered of significant importance 
due to their incidence and rate of mortality in developing 
countries.1 The low effectiveness, limited availability and high 
toxicity of existing treatments for these illnesses emphasize 
the importance of continuing the search for new antiprotozoan 
pharmaceuticals.2 Plants are considered an important source 
of biologically active natural products,3 including a number 
of them with antiprotozoan activity.4-6 During the screening 
of extracts from native Yucatecan medicinal plants as 
potential sources of bioactive metabolites, the root extract 
of Colubrina greggii S. Watson var. yucatanensis M. C. 
Johnst., a shrub used for the treatment of liver diseases, 
ulcerations, abscesses, asthma and tuberculosis,7 showed 
Metabolites from Roots of Colubrina greggii var. yucatanensis J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1280
trypanocidal, antimalarial, leishmanicidal and cytostatic 
activity.8,9 Previous phytochemical studies of the genus 
Colubrina (Rhamnaceae), which include 31 species,10 
reported the presence of a wide structural diversity of 
metabolites, including ansa macrolides, saponins, aporphinic 
alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavones and triterpenoid acids.11-18 
To date, only chrysophanol, an anthraquinone with 
antimicrobial activity, has been reported as a metabolite from 
C. greggii.19 In the present study we report the leishmanicidal, 
trypanocidal, antiplasmodial, cytotoxic and antiproliferative 
activity of the crude extract, semi-purified fractions and 
isolated metabolites from the root extract of C. greggii 
var. yucatanensis.
Results and Discussion
Fractionation of the bioactive root extract of C. greggii 
var. yucatanensis yielded a low polarity fraction with 
leishmanicidal, trypanocidal and antiplasmodial activities 
and a medium-polarity fraction with leishmanicidal 
activity. Successive purification of the medium-polarity 
fraction resulted in the isolation of 3-O-acetyl-ceanoth-
20(30)-en-1,28-dioic acid (3-O-acetyl ceanothic acid) (1) 
as a new natural ceanothane triterpene, together with the 
known metabolites ceanothic acid (2), discarine B (5) 
and chrysophanein (6). Similarly, purification of the low-
polarity fraction led to the isolation and identification of 
ceanothenic acid (3) and betulinic acid (4) (Figure 1).
The FTIR spectrum of 1 showed absorption bands at 3073 
(CH=C), 1731 (ester) and 1681 cm-1 (carboxyl). The pseudo 
molecular ion peak [M + Na]+ at m/z 551.3524 in HRMS (high 
resolution mass spectrometry) indicated a molecular formula 
C32H48O6, implying nine degrees of unsaturation. Carbon 
multiplicity, deduced from HMQC (heteronuclear multiple 
quantum coherence) and DEPT (distortionless enhancement 
by polarization transfer) experiments, indicated the presence of 
seven methyl groups, nine methylene, seven methine, and nine 
quaternary carbons. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table S1, 
Figure S1) displayed seven three-proton singlets at d 0.88, 
0.98, 0.99, 1.06, 1.16, 1.68 and 2.03 consistent with methyl 
groups attached to quaternary carbons. The presence of an 
acetyl group was confirmed by the HMBC (heteronuclear 
multiple bond coherence) correlation of the methyl at d 2.03 
with the carbonyl at d 172.5, whereas an isopropenyl group 
was assigned from NMR signals corresponding to a methyl 
group (dH 1.68) attached to a sp2-carbon (dC 152.0) showing 
HMBC correlations with two vinylic protons at dH 4.58 
and d 4.70. The double bond and three carbonyl groups 
observed in the 13C NMR of 1 (d 172.5, 177.4 and 180.1) 
accounted for four degrees of unsaturation thus indicating 
that the five remaining unsaturation sites corresponded to 
a pentacyclic structure. The spectroscopic data of 1 proved 
to be very similar to those reported for ceanothic acid (2), a 
ceanothane triterpene also known as emmolic acid, originally 
isolated from Ceanothus americanus20 and later identified 
from Colubrina granulosa.13 However, the presence of a

 low-field carbinol proton (d 5.07) and an acetyl methyl singlet 
(d 2.03) in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, both showing strong 
HMBC correlations with the ester carbonyl carbon (d 172.5), 
suggested that 1 was the 3-O-acetyl derivative of ceanothic 
acid, which was confirmed when acetylation of 2 produced 
1 as the only product. The presence of 1 in the original root 
extract of C. greggii, as detected by TCL (Figure S2), ruled 
out its being an artifact of the isolation procedure.
Discarine B (5), chrysophanein (6) and ceanothenic 
acid (3) were identified from comparison of their 
spectroscopic data (Tables S1, S2 and S3) with those 
reported in literature.21-23 Betulinic acid (4) was identified 
by comparison with an authentic sample.24
All of the isolated metabolites and the semisynthetic 
esters acetyl-dimethyl ceanothate (1a), dimethyl ceanothate 
(2a) and chrysophanein peracetate (6a) were evaluated for 
their in vitro antiprotozoan (leishmanicidal, trypanocidal, 
and antiplasmodial), cytotoxic and antiproliferative 
activities (Table 1). The results showed a moderate 
leishmanicidal activity (IC50 values of 20-28 µg mL-1) for 
natural ceanothanes 1 and 3 and semisynthetic derivatives 
2a and 6a, whereas a low trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 
30-70 µg mL-1) was observed for the natural products 3-5 
and the semisynthetic esters 1a and 6a. Betulinic acid (4) 
appeared to contribute to the antiplasmodial activity of the 
crude extract of C. greggii, with an IC50 of 9.7 µg mL-1.25,26
Although the crude root extract, together with the low 
and medium polarity fractions showed cytotoxic activity 
against HEp-2 cells, none of the isolated metabolites 
displayed this type of activity (Table S4). Furthermore, 
none of the metabolites tested, with the exception of the 
peracetylated chrysophanein (6a), showed antiproliferative 
activity against KB cells (Table S5). It is interesting to 
point out that the cytotoxic activity of C. macrocarpa and 
C. texensis has been attributed to the presence of colubrinol 
and its acetate,11,27 however these metabolites were not 
detected in the root extract of C. greggii. 
To date, ceanothane triterpenes have only been reported 
to occur in species of the Rhamnaceae family,20,23,28-36 and 
particularly in those belonging to the ziziphoids in the 
tribal classification reported by Richardson et al.38 These 
results, together with our finding of ceanothanes in the root 
extract of C. greggii, support the possible use of this class of 
triterpenes as chemotaxonomic markers for a classification 
of Rhamnaceae based on a phylogenetic analysis.

(E.M. Merck, 0.2 mm thickness) and the chromatograms 
visualized using a solution of phosphomolybdic acid (20 g) 
and ceric sulfate (2.5 g) in 500 mL of sulfuric acid (5%). Flash 
chromatography purifications were performed using silica gel 
(Aldrich, 200-400 mesh), while TLC-grade silica gel 60GF254 
(E.M. Merck) was used for vacuum liquid chromatography 
(VLC). Prep-TLC purifications were carried out using glass 
plates impregnated with silica gel 60 F254 (E.M. Merck, 
0.25 mm thickness, 20 × 20 cm). Melting points (uncorrected) 
were determined from a Mel-Temp II apparatus (Laboratory 
Devices Inc.). The optical rotations were measured in CHCl3 
using a Perkin Elmer 341 polarimeter. FTIR (Fourier transform 
infrared) spectra were recorded in CHCl3 or MeOH (film) 
using an FT-Nicolet Magna Protégé 460 spectrophotometer. 
1H NMR (400 and 600 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 and 
150 MHz) spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 400 
spectrometer or a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer with CHN 
cryoprobe, using the residual solvent resonances as internal 
references, calibrated to TMS. Electrospray high-resolution 
mass spectra (ESI-HRMS) were determined by direct injection 
on a Waters Q-TOF microsystem (using 0.1% phosphoric 
acid in a 1:1 water/acetonitrile mixture as reference), or 
using an Orbitrap MS (Thermo) connected to a Surveyor 
HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography, Thermo) 
for sample injection.
Plant material
Roots of Colubrina greggii S. Watson var. yucatanensis 
M. C. Johnst. were collected in Abalá, Yucatán, México. 
A voucher specimen (P. Simá-D. Domínguez 2916) was 
deposited in the Herbarium of Centro de Investigación 
Científica de Yucatán.
Extraction of plant material and purification of crude 
extract
Dry roots of C. greggii (365 g) were extracted three 
times with ethanol (4 L) at room temperature. Evaporation 
of the solvent yielded the corresponding crude extract (CG-1, 
54.5 g, 14.9%), which was suspended in 1.8 L of a H2O/MeOH 
(3:2, v/v) mixture. The suspension was fractionated by 
successive liquid-liquid partition with hexane (three 
times; 2:1, 1:1, 1:1; v:v of solvent:aqueous suspension), 
ethylacetate (three times; 2:1, 1:1, 1:1) and water-saturated 
butanol (1:2; v:v solvent:aqueous suspension) to yield the 
corresponding low (CG-2A), medium (CG-2B) and high 
(CG-2C) polarity fractions. Purification of the medium 
polarity fraction (CG-2B, 9.6 g) by VLC, using a gradient 
elution with CH2Cl2/Me2CO (99:1 to 94:6) followed 
by CHCl3/hexane/MeOH (70:25:5), yielded fractions 
CG-5A-N. Fraction CG-5E (550 mg) was purified by flash 
chromatography using an isocratic elution with hexane/
Me2CO 8:2, to produce pure 3-O-acetyl-ceanothic acid (1, 
172.1 mg), and fraction CG-6I (50 mg) which was further 
purified by column chromatography [ether/hexane (1:1)] to 
yield ceanothic acid (2, 16.5 mg). Additional purification of 
fraction CG-5C (414 mg) by flash chromatography, using a 
gradient elution with hexane/Me2CO (8:2-7:3), resulted in the 
isolation of discarine B (5, 108 mg). Finally, chrysophanein 
(6, 168.5 mg) was collected as a yellow precipitate by 
filtration from fraction CG-5G. Purification of the low 
polarity fraction (CG-2A, 1.5 g) by VLC, using a gradient 
elution with mixtures of hexane/Me2CO/MeOH (95:3:2 to 
60:38:2), produced eleven fractions (CG-3A-K). Fractions 
CG-3E-F were combined (500 mg) and purified by flash 
chromatography (hexane/ether 7:3), to yield ceanothenic 
acid (3, 20.8 mg) and betulinic acid (4, 20.4 mg).

Bioassays
Leishmanicidal assay
The growth inhibition of promastigotes was carried 
out following the procedure previously reported by 
Muñoz et al.,39 and Inchausti et al.40 Briefly, a strain of L. 
amazonensis (IFLA/BR/75/PH8) was grown in Schneider 
culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin 
(100 IU mL-1) and streptomycin (100 mg mL-1) at 25 °C; 
parasites in the log phase of their growth cycle were then 
transferred to a microplate (96 wells; 1 × 105 parasites/well). 
Stock solutions of DMSO (blank), pentamidine (positive 
control), crude extract, semipurified fractions and 
pure metabolites were diluted in Schneider medium at 
≤ 100 µg mL-1, added to the plate, and incubated for 72 h. 
The percentages of inhibition were obtained by directed 
observation of each well with an inverted phase microscope. 
All the assays were carried out in triplicate.
Trypanocidal assay
Epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Tulahuen 
parasites were maintained in liver infusion tryptose (LIT) 
medium supplemented with 5% FBS, following the procedure 
modified by Chataing et al.41 Briefly, parasites in the log phase 
of growth cycle were transferred to a microplate (96 wells; 
1 × 106 parasites/well) together with stock solutions of 
benznidazole, DMSO (positive control and blank respectively), 
extract, semipurified fractions or pure metabolites prepared 
at different concentrations (≤ 100 µg mL-1). The microplates 
were incubated at 26 °C for 72 h.
Antiplasmodial assay
Plasmodium falciparum strain F32 was grown at 37 °C 
in RPMI medium with 10% of human serum and 4% of 
hematocrit (O, Rh+), under anaerobic conditions, according 
to a reported method.41 Cultures with 1% parasitemic and 
2% hematocrite (100 µL) were transferred to a 96 well plate. 
Stock solutions of chloroquine (positive control), DMSO 
(blank), extract, semipurified fractions or pure metabolites 
were diluted in RPMI medium to a concentration of 
< 10 µg mL-1 and added to each well. The plate was then 
incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.
Cytotoxicity assay
Human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2), human cervical 
adenocarcinoma (HeLa), human nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
(KB), and green monkey Vero kidney cells (VERO) 
were grown in DMEM (Gibco) media supplemented 
with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco), penicillin (100 IU mL–1), 
and streptomycin (100 mg mL-1). All the cell lines were 
maintained at 37 ºC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with 95% 
Metabolites from Roots of Colubrina greggii var. yucatanensis J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1284
humidity. The cytotoxicity assay was performed according 
to a method described by Rahman et al.43 Briefly, cell lines 
were transferred to a microplate (1.5 × 104 viable cells of 
each cell line) and incubated at 37 °C, with 95% humidity 
and 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% 
of FBS, penicillin (10000 IU), streptomycin (10 mg mL-1), 
and amphotericine B (5 mg mL-1). After 24 h, the medium 
was replaced by fresh medium with 0.05% DMSO 
(blank) or different concentrations of docetaxel (positive 
control, Sigma), crude extract, semipurified fractions or 
pure metabolites dissolved in DMSO (100, 50, 25, 12.5 
and 6.25 µg mL-1), and the cells were incubated for 72 h 
under the conditions already described. The medium was 
removed and 200 µL of a 0.5% MTT (Sigma) solution in 
PBS (pH 7.2) were added to each well, and left to stand 
for 4 h at 37 °C. Then 100 µL of acidified isopropanol 
(0.4 mol L-1 HCl) were added to each well and the optical 
density (OD) measured at 540 nm using a Bioassay reader 
(Bio-Rad). The experiment was carried out in triplicate and 
each concentration was tested in duplicate.
Antiproliferative assay
The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was carried out 
according to the method reported by Rahman et al.,43 
using DMEM medium with 10% FBS to induce cell 
proliferation. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was 
discarded and 100 µL of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic 
acid (TCA, Aldrich) were added to fix the cells, 
incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed five 
times with water, left to dry, and then 50 µL of SRB 
stain (10 mg 1% acetic acid, Sigma) were added to each 
well and left to stand for 30 min. Finally, the cells were 
washed with 50 mL 1% acetic acid, and rinsed four times 
with water. The OD was measured at 540 nm using an 
ELISA reader (Bio-Rad model 450). The experiment 
was carried out in triplicate.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with commercial software 
(GraphPad 4.0, Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The dose–
response curves (variable slope) to obtain the inhibitory 
concentration (in µg mL-1) of 50% of parasites (IC50), the 
growth inhibition of 50% of cells (IG50), and the cytotoxic 
concentration of 50% of cells (CC50), were fitted to the 
algorithm: Y = Emin + [(Emax - Emin)/(1 + 10(log ED50 - 
log D) hill slope)].
