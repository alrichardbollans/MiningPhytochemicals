Malus x domestica and the modulation of pollen
tube growth
Juan M Losada1,2 and Maria Herrero1*Abstract
Background: The characteristics of pollen tube growth are not constant, but display distinct patterns of growth
within the different tissues of the pistil. In the stigma, the growth rate is slow and autotrophic, whereas in the style,
it is rapid and heterotrophic. Very little is known about the interactions between these distinct maternal tissues and
the traversing pollen tube and the role of this interaction on the observed metabolism. In this work we characterise
pollen tube growth in the apple flower and look for differences in glycoprotein epitope localization between two
different maternal tissues, the stigma and the style.
Results: While immunocytochemically-detected arabinogalactan proteins were present at high levels in the stigma,
they were not detected in the transmitting tissue of the style, where extensins were abundant. Whereas extensins
remained at high levels in unpollinated pistils, they were no longer present in the style following pollen tube
passage. Similarily, while abundant in unpollinated styles, insoluble polysaccharides such as β-glucans, were
depleted in pollinated pistils.
Conclusions: The switch from autotropic to heterotrophic pollen tube growth correlates spatially with a change of
glycoprotein epitopes between the stigma and the style. The depletion of extensins and polysaccharides following
pollen tube passage in the style suggest a possible contribution to the acceleration of heterotrophic pollen tube
growth, which would imply an active contribution of female tissues on prezygotic male–female crosstalk.

The development and function of the male gametophyte
is amazingly well conserved across flowering plants. Fol-
lowing pollen grain hydration, a pollen tube starts to de-
velop. The vegetative cell, hosting the generative cell or
the two sperm cells, travels along extensible tip of the
pollen tube, the area where the new wall is built. This
continuous construction of a new wall at the apical end
allows the growth of the pollen tube tip to be oriented
towards the female gametophyte [1]. This highly con-
served process, however, contrasts with clear differences
found in the speed at which this wall is built up. Com-
parison of the process in multiple species shows that* Correspondence: mherrero@eead.csic.es

distribution, and reproduction in any mediumevolutionary derived flowering seed plants have a faster
pollen tube growth rate than extant non-flowering seed
plants, as well as early divergent angiosperms [2,3].
Pollen tube growth is complex and highly variable de-
pending on the conditions. Since early work in the
1940s, it has been shown that the pollen tube growth
rate is dependent on temperature in a wide range of spe-
cies [4-6]. The growth rate in in vitro germination media
is lower compared to in vivo conditions [7]. Additionally,
the pollen tube growth rate also varies depending on the
surrounding maternal tissue. The pollen tube traverses
different tissues within the pistil on its path to the em-
bryo sac, and the recorded pollen tube growth rate is
faster in the style compared to the stigma or the ovary
[8,9]. As observed in different species such as peaches
[10] or alders [11], slow growth in the ovary has been re-
lated to stops and decelerations resulting from the waitCentral Ltd. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/1for particular structures -the obturator or the ovules- to
become receptive to the pollen tube. Indeed, male–female
synchrony appears to be a prerequisite for successful
fertilization [12].
The requirement for coordinated timing between ga-
metophytes raises the question of why pollen tubes cross
large styles at high speeds. Darwin (1886) [13], puzzled
on how pollen tubes rapidly covered long styles, sug-
gested that some kind of support was provided by the
style. In the 1970s, the incorporation of labelled com-
pounds from the style into growing pollen tubes [14], to-
gether with the fact that starch was depleted from the
style as pollen tubes passed by [15], suggested that a
change from an autotrophic to heterotrophic pollen tube
growth in the style was associated with an acceleration
in pollen tube growth rate [8,16].
In the centre of the style, either a canal or a transmit-
ting tract composed of specialized secretory tissues
through which pollen tubes undergo tip oriented growth,
represents the location for male–female molecular inter-
actions [17,18]. In species with hollow styles, such as
Lilium, the secretory cells bordering the stylar canal
exert a crucial role by providing adhesion and chemotro-
pic guidance cues for the growing pollen tubes [19,20].
Some of these cues also appear to play a part in species
with solid styles [21]. The stylar transmitting tissue of
most dicots is composed of elongated cells [22] that se-
crete a pectinaceous extracellular matrix. In Arabidopsis,
the non-proteic amino acid γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA)
is needed for pollen tube elongation in the ovary [23]. In
mutants lacking GABA, the expression of genes encod-
ing secreted proteins of the cell wall in the ovarian
transmitting tissue is also affected [24]. However, since
the pollen tube wall is mainly carbohydrate based, a nu-
tritional relationship likely relies on individual polysac-
charides or glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins.
Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HPRGPs), a super-
family of abundant glycoproteins in styles, have been also
detected in pollen tube walls in abundant levels [25,26].
Within this superfamily, arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs)
are involved in a number of developmental processes dur-
ing the plant life cycle [27]. AGPs have been found in the
style of Nicotiana; in particular, the transmitting tissue-
specific glycoprotein (TTS) has been shown to attract and
stimulate pollen tubes following a deglycosylation gradient
[28,29] as well as providing guidance cues for growing
pollen tubes [30,31]. Additionally, extensins (EXTs), an-
other group of HPRGPs normally related to cell elongation
processes [32,33], actively participate in the progamic
phase in some species. EXTs have been reported in repro-
ductive tissues of some angiosperms, for example the pistil
specific extensin-like protein (PELPIII) of Solanaceae
was recently shown to play a role in interspecific
incompatibility in Nicotiana [34]. PELPIII also showsbiochemical characteristics of AGPs and prevent inter-
specific hybridization [35]. Putting all this information
together indicates that the style supports pollen tube
growth [36], and that a modulator effect on pollen tube
wall formation occurs due to an intense provision of nu-
trients and signals from the female tissues to the male
pollen tubes [37,38]. Exogenous application of specific
compounds can mimic the role of the style to support
pollen tube growth in mutants with a hollow style [39].
On the male side, expansion of the pollen tube wall
occurs at a fast rate and contains mostly de-esterified
pectins and callose at their shank and esterified pectins
and cellulose at the proximal growing region [40]. Dur-
ing pollen tube elongation, callose plugs isolate the ac-
tive tube tip from the rest of the tube [41]. Extensin-like
proteins become detectable during pollen tube elong-
ation [42]. In fact, the best characterised extensins are
the non-classical, pollen specific extensin-like proteins
(Pex) from maize and tomato, which have been localized
to the inner callose layer of pollen tubes [43]. These
extensins contain the leucine rich repeat domain (LRR),
a motif shared between dicots and monocots, and are
putatively involved in communication [44]. Thus far,
however, the role for “classic” extensins during pollen-
pistil interactions remains elusive.
This still fragmented information is difficult to put
together by the fact that the genetic control of maternal
tissues over pollen tubes is elusive, apart from stylar in-
compatibility mutations, no pistil mutants have been
reported that arrest pollen tube growth in the style dur-
ing compatible matings, even though TTS glycopro-
teins play a clear part in pollen tube growth [29,30]. As
an alternative, immunocytology can shed light on this
process by identifying the proteins present in the pistil
and their spatial distribution following pollination. This
approach has been successfully used in the stigma of
the apple flower; the detection of two particular AGP
epitopes (via JIM 8 and JIM 13), is associated with the
acquisition of stigmatic receptivity [45]. The disappear-
ance of these AGP epitopes is correlated with pollen
tube growth. Information is still lacking on the rela-
tionship between glycoprotein detection and how the
style provides provisions for pollen tube wall building.
In this work, we follow pollen tube growth rate in the
apple style and evaluate the pistil support of pollen
tube wall formation. It is known that polysaccharides
[46] and S-RNases are present in the transmitting
tissue cells of apple [47]. Our results illustrate the
localization differences between glycoprotein epitopes
in the intercellular spaces of the stigma and the style.
While β-glucans and extensins are present in abundant
levels in unpollinated pistils, they decrease in abun-
dance and become undetectable in the style as the
pollen tubes pass by.

Pollen tube growth rates and transmitting tissue
characterization
Apple pentacarpelar pistils have five individual styles. In
apple as in other Pomoideae, the base of the styles and
the ovaries are enclosed within a tissue, the hypanthium,
which at maturity constitutes the edible part of the fruit
(Figure 1). On the stigmatic surface, pollen grains germi-
nated by two hours after pollination and grew along the
stigma surface. By ten hours after pollination, pollen
tubes penetrated the transmitting tissue in the area of
the suture line, covering a distance of some 700 μm from
the edge of the stigma to the suture line. This results in a
pollen tube growth rate of 87 μm · h-1 [700 μm/(10 h-2 h)]
in the stigma. Once in the style, the longest pollen tube
had travelled 50% of the length of the style two days after
pollination and 90% of the length of the style three days
after pollination (Figure 2A). In the style, pollen tubes
grew 11 mm in 62 hours (72 h – 10 h for stigma growth),
equalling a growth rate of roughly 177 μm · h-1. PollenFigure 1 Pentacarpelar apple pistil showing individual stylar
parts from top (stigma) to bottom (hypanthium), and scheme
of the sections along the style (insert, red squares) evaluated in
this work.tube growth varied between styles, and the hypanthium
entrance was reached in 20% of the styles two days after
pollination, and in 70% of the styles three days after pol-
lination (Figure 2B). At this time a mean number of eight
pollen tubes per style reached the hypanthium entrance
(Figure 2C). This number was maintained until the fifth
day after pollination, when for unknown reasons, a second
wave of pollen tubes arrived. At seven days after pollin-
ation, there was a mean of 20 pollen tubes at the hypan-
thium entrance.
At anthesis, absence of starch grains contrasted with
the presence of insoluble polysaccharides in the intercel-
lular spaces of both the stigmatoid tissue and the upper
stylar transmitting tissue (Figure 3A, B). However, stain-
ing for proteins with Naphtol Blue Black gave no reac-
tion in the intercellular spaces of the stigmatoid tissue
(Figure 3C) in contrast to the strong protein staining
both within and between the cells of the transmitting
tissue (Figure 3D). Since a reduction in the population
of the growing pollen tubes was observed and only 8%
of the germinated pollen grains on the stigma reached
the stylar base, we searched for a possible reduction in
the area occupied by the transmitting tissue at the style
base. While in the upper style the transmitting tissue
cross section area was 14.900 μm2, at the bottom of the
style (Figure 3E) it was reduced to 2.500 μm2, a six fold
reduction.
Polysaccharides in the style
Since pollen tube walls are composed of pectins, cellu-
lose and callose [40], unpollinated and pollinated styles
were stained with calcofluor white to visualize cellulose
and other polysaccharides [48], and immmunolabelled
for the linear β-(1–3) glucans, the backbone of callose
[49]. After pollination, the papillae cell walls in the
stigma stained for cellulose, but were devoid of callose
(Figure 4A, B). Germinating pollen grains, on the other
hand, displayed callose localization in the pollen tube
wall (Figure 4C).
In the style, unpollinated flowers were positive for cellu-
lose and other polysaccharides, which accumulated in a
centripetal fashion from the edges to the centre in the
transmitting tissue cells (Figure 4D). In addition, immuno-
localization revealed a callose layer surrounding those sac-
charidic accumules (Figure 4E). However, in pollinated
styles, callose was only detected in the pollen tube walls
(Figure 4F, G), but not in transmitting tissue cells (Fig-
ure 4H). At three days after anthesis, unpollinated styles
accumulated carbohydrates following a basipetal fashion
and were present at the base of the style (Figure 4I, J).
In pollinated styles, cellulose (Figure 4K) and callose
(Figure 4L) were present in pollen tube walls, but were
not detected in the transmitting tissue cells (Figure 4K,
L and M).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/1Different glycoprotein epitopes in the style
At anthesis, arabinogalactan proteins detected with
JIM13 mAb, were observed in the cortical tissue and
the stigmatoid tissue (Figure 5A and [45]). However,
they were lacking in the transmitting tissue of the style
(Figure 5A). In contrast, extensin epitopes recognised
by JIM11 mAb were lacking in the stigmatoid tissue,
but were conspicuously detected in the extracellular
spaces of the style transmitting tissue (Figure 5B). A
closer view to the stigma showed that while AGPs rec-
ognized by JIM13 mAb filled the intercellular spaces of
the stigmatoid tissue (Figure 5C), extensins recognized
by JIM11 mAb filled the intercellular space of the
contiguous tissue, the transmitting tissue of the style
(Figure 5D). This was further confirmed along the
style, and while AGP epitopes were detected in the cell
walls of the cortical tissue (Figure 5E), they were not in
the stylar transmitting tissue. On the other hand, and
consistent with observations made closer to the
stigma, the intercellular matrix of the transmitting tis-
sue showed a strong presence of extensin epitopes
(Figure 5F).
Due to their location at places of pollen tube elongation,
a possible role of extensins in pollen tube growth was eval-
uated by the comparison of pollinated and unpollinated
styles. In unpollinated flowers, the intercellular spaces of
the upper part of the transmitting tissue (Figure 6A)
strongly reacted to extensin epitopes and accumulated to
higher levels following anthesis (Figure 6B). In pollinated
flowers, pollen tubes were observed in the intercellular
spaces (Figure 6C); extensin epitopes were detectable in
the transmitting tissue, however, the accumulation of
extensins was at far lower levels compared to unpollinated
flowers (Figure 6D). In the middle of the style, three days
after anthesis cellulosic walls (Figure 6E) delimited the
dense cytoplasmic large cells of the transmitting tissue, as
well as extensins conspicuously filled the intercellular
spaces (Figure 6F). In pollinated flowers, as pollen tubes
elongated along the intercellular domains of the style
transmitting tissue (Figure 6G), a constant contact between
pollen tube walls and an extensin-rich extracellular matrix
was observed (Figure 6H). A similar pattern could be seen
at the style base, where the extracellular matrix of the
transmitting tissue in unpollinated pistils conspicuously
showed extensin epitopes (Figure 6I). Interestingly, exten-
sin epitopes were detected at much lower levels in polli-
nated flowers, particularly in areas closer to pollen tube
passage (Figure 6J).
Taking together these observations, show that β-
glucan polysaccharides and extensins developmentally
accumulated in a centripetal and basipetal way all along
the stylar transmitting tissue, but these compounds
could no longer be detected following pollen tube
passage.Discussion
Results in this work suggest that extensins and polysac-
charides of the style transmitting tissue contribute to the
pollen tube growth in the apple style. While they accumu-
late in unpollinated styles, they can no longer be detected
in pollinated styles. These extensins and polysaccharides
appear only in the style, not in the stigma, strongly sug-
gesting that they contribute to the growth of pollen tubes
in the style.The change from autotrophic to heterotrophic pollen
tube growth
Reports in a wide range of species with different style
types have provided evidence for a nutritive role for the
transmitting tract, where starch depletion was coincident
with pollen tube elongation [9,16,50-53]. The immuno-
cytological localization described in this work provides
further support for this idea. While starch was not de-
tected in the apple transmitting tissue, polysaccharides
accumulated in the extracellular matrix of unpollinated
styles. Polysaccharide composition and presence was
determined by staining with PAS for general insoluble
polysaccharides, calcofluor for cellulose and pectins detec-
tion, and by immunolocalization of linear β-(1,3)-glucan
segments, the backbone of callose.
Callose has been repeatedly detected in the inner wall
of the pollen tube shank in different angiosperms
[16,38,54]. It has been suggested that its function is re-
lated to a resistance to pressure with some degree of
permeability [55]. Those functional capacities are also
supported by the pecto-cellulosic composition of the
pollen tube wall [44,56]. At the pollen tube extensible
tip, exocytosis of de novo materials appears to be the
main contributor to pollen tube elongation, but also endo-
cytosis is required to recycle and regulate wall materials,
such as membrane proteins [57]. Even though callose is
primarily produced by the internal machinery of the
pollen tubes, the incredibly high amounts of this polysac-
charide in pollen tubes could also result from the intake
of precursors from the pistil tissues. There is scarce evi-
dence, however, regarding the provenance of the callose
and cellulose required to build the pollen tube wall [44].
While stigma cells were devoid of callose, germinating
pollen grains were rich in this β-glucan, with a strong
localization signal at the inner side of the growing pollen
tube walls after pollen germination. Whereas in unpolli-
nated styles these and other polysaccharides accumulated
in the transmitting tract, they were no longer detected in
pollinated pistils. Callose accumulation in unpollinated
styles could play a part in defence, but the disappearance
of these β-glucans in pollinated pistils strongly suggests a
role for maternal support of pollen tube growth in the
style [8,16,17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/1Strategies in the style controlling pollen tube growth
The observed reduction in the transmitting tissue area
along the style, together with a reduction in the β-
glucans and extensins contributing to pollen tube elong-
ation suggest that the style could play a role in pollen
tube competition. A reduction in the area of the style
that pollen tubes traverse has been reported in species
with both solid [58,59], and hollow styles [53]. It was
proposed that physical constraints due to the funnel-like
structure of the style were one of the main factors
favouring pollen tube competition and selection along
the style, resulting in higher quality off-spring produced
[37,60-62]. Results from this work support this model in
which a reduction in the area accumulating provisions
limited the available resources and resulted in only a
small percentage of the pollen tubes reaching the base of
the style. However, it is not yet clear whether the first
pollen tubes that reach the base of the style are more
successful at achieving fertilization [63]. Instead of arriv-
ing all at once, apple pollen tubes arrive at the stylar
base in two waves, enabling selection within the style
first, followed by a second selection at the ovary site. All
together data herein suggest a finely-tuned system of
maternal and paternal interactions with implications on
the sexual conflict in plants [64], and thus sporophytic
female selection of male gametophytes might be influ-
enced by specific spatial arrangement of glycoproteins in
the maternal transmitting tissue, the pathway of pollen
tubes.
Different glycoprotein epitopes for different pistil
territories
While the results suggest that the style might favours
pollen tube competition, the question remains as to why
the pollen tube growth rate is slower in the stigma than
in the style. This may be related to the different glyco-
protein epitopes present in the different territories of the
pollen tube pathway. Within the apple pistil, arabinoga-
lactan proteins were abundant in the stigmatoid tissue,
but were lacking in the stylar transmitting tissue. Strik-
ingly, extensins were not detectable in the stigma with
the antibodies used, but were present at abundant levels
in the intercellular spaces of the style transmitting tissue.
This specialized glycoproteins distribution is surprising
given that the stigma and the style are contiguous tis-
sues. In Solanaceae pistils, extensin-like proteins (PEL-
PIII) have been reported to play a part in interspecific
incompatibility through the initial localisation in the sty-
lar transmitting tract followed by relocation to the inner
callose layer of growing pollen tubes [33-35]. Arabinoga-
lactan proteins have also been localised in the transmit-
ting tissue of different angiosperm species ranging from
early-divergent angiosperms [65] to eudicots such as Ni-
cotiana, where a glycosylation gradient related to pollentube nutrition has been reported [28-31]. Furthermore,
expansins in the extracellular matrix have been associ-
ated with relaxation of the intercellular space for pollen
tube penetration in both the stigma and the style in
grasses [66-69]. The stigma-style transition is also
marked by an acceleration of pollen tube growth rate.
This increase in the rate of growth was previously re-
ported in other species including Petunia [15], peach [9],
kiwifruit [50], and apricot [70]. Pollen tube growth in
the style also appears to be faster than in the ovary
[11,71], and these differences have been related to the
requirement for maturation of ovary structures. The ac-
celeration of pollen tube growth rate in the style could
be due to developmental events within the pollen tube
itself, such as the deposition of the first callose plug, the
completion of mitosis II, or by an internally programmed
shift to heterotrophic growth. Results herein suggest that
the different composition of glycoproteins observed in the
stigma and the style could also play a part.
Our results show that extensins also have a role in the
apple stylar transmitting tract. Their undetectability fol-
lowing the passage of pollen tubes provides additional
suggestion of heterotrophic pollen tube growth in the
style. Extensins are essential builders of new plant cell
walls [72], and the close relationship with growing pollen
tubes along the pistil suggests a role for extensins in
pollen tube wall building and acceleration of the growth
rate in the style. Extensins have been shown to play a
biochemical role in the tensile strength of growing cells
[73]. However, given the presence of a leucine rich re-
peat (LRR) domain in some extensins [34], a role as
recognition-signal molecules cannot be ruled out. Among
the best characterised, LRR chimera extensins (Pex) in
maize and tomato pollen tubes have been suggested to
play a role in pollen-style interactions [37,38,73]. This
work shows that in the apple flower pollen tube growth is
modulated by the different pistil tissues it has to traverse.
Further work will elucidate whether this is a conserved
pattern in other angiosperms.
Conclusions
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that precise
glycoprotein distribution in the different pistil tissues is
important in the finely-tuned pollen-pistil interaction. The
switch, from an autotrophic pollen tube growth in the
stigma to heterotrophic growth in the style, occurs with a
two-fold acceleration in pollen tube growth rate. This is
accompanied by the presence of extensins and β-glucans
which accumulate in a basipetal fashion in the style, but
not in the stigma. While these resources are present in
unpollinated flowers, they were no longer detectable in
pollinated flowers when the pollen tubes passed by, sug-
gesting a contribution to rapid wall building in pollen
tubes. A reduction in the number of pollen tubes reaching

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/1the base of the style is accompanied by a basipetal reduc-
tion, both in the area and in the resources available along
the style, strongly suggesting that this reduction favours
pollen tube competition. This observations open a door
for understanding species-specific pollen-pistil interac-
tions and for the possible role these interactions have in
prezygotic mechanisms of speciation.Methods
Plant material
Flowers from apple trees cv Golden Delicious Spur
grown in the province of Huesca (Spain), 461m above
sea level were used in this study. To evaluate pollen tube
elongation along the style, a bunch of 120 flowers were
emasculated at balloon stage and left for 24 h until hand
pollination [74].
Since apples are self-incompatible, anthers from the
compatible cv Royal Gala were collected from flowers at
an advanced balloon stage and left to dry on paper at
room temperature around 20ºC for 24–48 h until dehis-
cence. Pollen was sieved with a mesh with a diameter
pore of 0.26 mm and then stored at -20ºC until required.
Half of the flowers −60- were left without pollination,
and the other half −60- were hand pollinated with a
paint brush.Pollen tube growth rate evaluation along the style
To monitor pollen tube growth rate in the stigma and
the style, following hand pollinations, five flowers −30
gynoecia- were sampled at intervals of two hours up to
twelve hours, and later the same number of flowers was
daily sampled and fixed in FAA (formalin: acetic acid:
70% ethanol) (1:1:18) [75] for seven days after pollin-
ation. After being fixed, the pistils were washed three
times in distilled water for one hour each, and left in 5%
sodium sulphite for 24 h. Samples were autoclaved for
10 min at 1 Kg cm-2 in 5% sodium sulphite, and then the
individual styles were squashed onto glass slides with 0.1%
aniline blue in 0.1NK3PO4 to visualize callose [76,77] and
pollen tubes [41]. Pollen tubes were visualized with a
LEICA DM2500 fluorescence microscope bearing a 340/
400 nm filter, and pollen tube number was counted at the
hypanthium entrance. Percentages of styles with pollen
tubes at the stylar base were recorded in pollinated pistils
fixed at different days after pollination, and were sequen-
tially compared by days after pollination using chi-square
homogeneity test at a P ≤ 0.05. Both percentages of styles
traversed and mean number of pollen tubes at the stylar
base were subjected to mean comparison by one way
ANOVA, and significant independent groups were sepa-
rated by Duncan multiple range test at a P ≤ 0.05. Statis-
tical analysis was performed with the SPSS software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, USA).Histochemical preparations
Flowers for histochemical examination were selected ac-
cording to the pollen tube kinetics results, at anthesis,
two, and three days after pollination. Two flowers - 10
styles - per day were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.03M saline phosphate buffer pH7.3 for 4 h [78]. Then
the pistils were washed in 0.03M saline phosphate buffer
and sequentially dehydrated in an ethanol series (30%,
50%, 70%, and 96%), leaving them one hour in each
ethanol concentration. The gynoecia were left for five
days in the embedding solution at 4ºC, and then embed-
ded in JB4 plastic resin (Polysciences Inc., 0226A). Both
longitudinal and transversal sections 2μm thick were cut
on a LEICA EM UC6 ultramicrotome with a glass knife
and then placed onto distilled water on a glass slide pre-
viously coated with 1% gelatine. Polysaccharides were
stained with periodic acid shift reagent-PAS [79] coun-
terstained with 0.02% Toluidine Blue for general struc-
ture, and proteins with 0.25% Naphtol Blue Black in 1%
acetic acid [80]. Also 0.07% calcofluor white for cellulose
[48] and other polysaccharides [52], 0.01% auramine in
0.05M phosphate buffer for cutin and lipids [81], and
0.01% acridine orange in 0.03% phosphate buffer, pH7.4
[82] were used to observe the stylar morphology.
Slides were observed under bright field LEICA DM2500
microscope carrying 100W light source, and photographs
were obtained with a Leica DFC320 camera linked to the
software Leica Application Suite. Fluorescence observa-
tions were done with the same microscope provided with
an epifluorescence source and connected to a CANON
Power Shot S50 camera linked to the CANON Remote
Capture software. Filters used were 355/455 nm for calco-
fluor white, and 450/510 nm for auramine and acridine
orange stained sections.
Immunolocalization of callose, AGPs and extensins
Two flowers per day from anthesis, two and three days
after pollination were fixed in 4% formaldehyde freshly
prepared from paraformaldehyde in 1x phosphate saline
buffer (PBS) pH7.3, left overnight at 4ºC, and conserved
then at 0.1% formaldehyde solution [83]. Then the pistils
were dehydrated in an acetone series (30%, 50%, 70%,
90%, 100%), and embedded in Technovit 8100 (Kulzer
and Co, Germany) for two days. The resin was polymer-
ized at 4ºC, and sectioned at 4 μm thickness. Sections
were placed in a drop of water on a slide covered with
2% (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane - APTEX (Sigma-
Aldrich), and dried at room temperature. Callose was
identified with the anticallose antibody (AntiCal) that
recognises linear β-(1,3)-glucan segments (anti-β-(1,3)-
glucan; immunoglobulin G1), Biosupplies, Australia
[49]. As a secondary antibody, Alexa 488 fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was
used (F-1763; Sigma). Additionally, a monoclonal

topes, and one mAb JIM11 [85] against extensin epi-
topes were obtained from Carbosource Services
(University of Georgia, USA). Secondary antibodies
were anti-rat IgG conjugated with the same Alexa 488
used above. Sections were incubated for 5 min in PBS
pH7.3 followed by 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS for 5 min. Then, sections were incubated at room
temperature for 1h with AntiCal primary mAb, JIM13,
and JIM11. After that, three washes in PBS of 5 minutes
each preceded the incubation for 45 min in the dark
with a 1/25 diluted secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) conjugated with the antibody in 1% BSA in PBS,
followed by three washes in PBS [83]. Sections were
counterstained with calcofluor white for cellulose [86],
mounted in PBS or Mowiol, and examined under a LEICA
DM2500 epifluorescence microscope connected to a
LEICA DFC320 camera. Filters were 355/455 nm for cal-
cofluor white and 470/525 nm for the Alexa 488 fluores-
cein label of the antibodies (White Level = 255; Black
Level = 0; ϒ = 1). Exposur (Exp) times were adapted to the
best compromise in overlapping photographs for each anti-
body: AntiCal, Exp. = 15.30ms (Calcofluor Exp. = 1.20ms);
JIM13 Exp. = 2.52ms (Calcofluor = 0.41ms); JIM11, Exp. =
31.59 ms (Calcofluor Exp. = 1.40ms). Brightness and con-
trasts were adjusted to obtain the sharpest images with the
Leica Application Suite software.
