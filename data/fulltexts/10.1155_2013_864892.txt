Brazilein, a natural, biologically active compound from Caesalpinia sappan L., has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant properties and to inhibit the growth of several cancer cells. This study verifies the antioxidant and antitumor
characteristics of brazilein in skin cancer cells and is the first time to elucidate the inhibitionmechanismof adipocyte differentiation,
cestocidal activities against Hymenolepis nana, and reduction of spontaneous movement in Anisakis simplex. Brazilein exhibits
an antioxidant capacity as well as the ability to scavenge DPPH∙ and ABTS∙+ free radicals and to inhibit lipid peroxidation.
Brazilein inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells and suppressed the induction
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 𝛾 (PPAR𝛾), the master regulator of adipogenesis, suggesting that brazilein presents
the antiobesity effects. The toxic effects of brazilein were evaluated in terms of cell viability, induction of apoptosis, and the activity
of caspase-3 in BCC cells.The inhibition of the growth of skin cancer cells (A431, BCC, and SCC25) by brazilein is greater than that
of human skin malignant melanoma (A375) cells, mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7 cells), and noncancerous
cells (HaCaT and BNLCL2 cells).The anthelmintic activities of brazilein againstHymenolepis nana are better than those ofAnisakis
simplex.
1. Introduction
All biological systems that operate under aerobic conditions
are exposed to oxidants that are generated either intentionally
or as byproducts [1]. Multiple species of oxidants are being
generated, as implied by the first letters of the terms “reactive
oxygen species” (ROS) and “reactive nitrogen species” (RNS)
[2]. When present in foods or body at lower concentrations
than that of an oxidizable substrate, antioxidants considerably
delay or prevent the oxidation of that substrate. Antioxidants
may help the body to protect itself against various forms of
oxidative damage that are caused by ROS and RNS, which are
associated with various diseases including cancer, diabetes,
shock, arthritis, and acceleration of the ageing process [3].
Reduced antioxidant capacity, the increased production
of ROS, and the elevated oxidation products of lipids, DNA,
and proteins have been identified in plasma, urine, and var-
ious tissues suggesting systemic and organ-specific oxidative
2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
stress [4]. Recentmethods of systemic oxidative stress include
the detection of increased circulating and urinary levels of the
lipid peroxidation product F2-isoprostane in both type I and
type II diabetic patients and in obese persons [5]. Obesity
is a serious public health problem because of its association
with the development of various diseases, including diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and many forms of
cancer [6]. Adipogenesis which plays an important role in
obesity involves the development of preadipocytes to mature
adipocytes with the accumulation of lipid droplets, increased
fat cell size (hypertrophy), and an increase in the number of
cells or hyperplasia [7]. Therefore, the reduction of obesity
may involve the inhibition of the adipogenic process and
lipid accumulation owing to dedifferentiation, lipolysis, and
apoptosis [8].
Hymenolepis nana is the most common cause of all
cestode infections and is found globally. In temperate zones,
its incidence is high in children and institutionalized groups.
H. nana infections are typically asymptomatic, but heavy
infections by H. nana can cause headaches, weakness,
anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [9]. H. nana is the
only cestode capable of completing its cycle without an
intermediate host [10]. Infection is most commonly acquired
from eggs in the feces of another infected individual, which
are transferred by contamination in food. Eggs hatch in
the duodenum, releasing oncospheres, which penetrate the
mucosa and come to lie in the lymph channels of the villi.
The oncospheres develop into a cysticercoid, which has a tail
and a well-formed scolex. It is made of longitudinal fibers
and is spade-shaped with the rest of the worm still inside
the cyst. In five to six days cysticercoids emerge into the
lumen of the small intestine, to which they attach before
they mature. Eggs ofH. nana are immediately infective when
passed with the stool and transferred in contaminated food.
Eggs are ingested by an arthropod intermediate host and
hatch in the duodenum, releasing oncospheres (hexacanth
larvae), which penetrate the intestinal villus and develop
into cysticercoid larvae, which have a tail and a well-formed
scolex. Upon rupture of the villus, the cysticercoids return
to the intestinal lumen, evaginate their scoleces, attach to
the intestinal mucosa and mature into adults that reside in
the ileal portion of the small intestine, producing gravid
proglottids. The eggs are then passed in the stool when
released from the proglottids through their genital atrium or
when the proglottids disintegrate in the small intestine. An
alternate mode of infection consists of internal autoinfection,
in which the eggs release their hexacanth embryo, which
penetrates the villus, continuing the infective cycle without
passing through the external environment.The short life span
and rapid course of development also facilitate the spread
and ready availability of this worm, but internal autoinfection
allows the infection to persist for years [10, 11].
Anisakis simplex adult worms in the primary host gastric
mucosa release eggs that are passed in the feces; in seawater,
the eggs are embryonated and form first-stage (AsL1) and
subsequently free-living second-stage larvae (AsL2). When
ingested by small crustacean first-intermediate hosts (such
as krills), the parasite matures into A. simplex third-stage
larvae (AsL3) that are subsequently consumed by marine fish
or squid (second intermediate hosts) (such as codfish, hake,
mackerel, cuttlefish, and sardines). The AsL3 larvae migrate
into the viscera and peritoneal cavity; the degree of migration
into the fish musculature may depend on environmental
conditions and/or the species of parasite andfish [12, 13].They
are often transferred among fish along the food chain, and
consequently, piscivorous fishmay accumulate large numbers
of larvae [13]. Ultimately, the ingestion of infected fish or
squid by a marine mammal (final host) leads to the devel-
opment of fourth-stage larvae and then adults. Humans can
become accidental hosts by consuming undercooked and/or
raw second-intermediate hosts that contain the AsL3. These
parasites rarely develop further within the human gastroin-
testinal tract, instead, by means of proteolytic enzymes, but
they typically become embedded in the gastric or intestinal
mucosa and die or invade the muscular layers of the stomach
and intestine to induce allergic reactions and a variety of
abdominal symptoms, which are characterized as anisakiasis
or anisakidosis [14]. The four main clinical syndromes in
humans who experience symptomatic anisakidosis include
gastric, intestinal, ectopic (or extra-gastrointestinal), and
allergic diseases.
Anisakidosis is globally recognized as a public health haz-
ard. It is relatively common in Asia and Europe [15, 16]. The
prevalence of the disease has increased markedly because of
the increasing popularity of Japanese cuisine, such as “sushi”
and “sashimi.” The pathology of Anisakis is attributable to
two main mechanisms-allergic reactions and direct tissue
damage [17], which results in violent abdominal pain, nausea,
and vomiting, which symptoms mimick gastric ulcers and
appendicitis. Moreover, the penetration ofA. simplex into the
stomach and bowel wall produces a severe eosinophilic gran-
ulomatous response. Although anisakiasis generally evolves
toward spontaneous resolution, some patients will develop
serious complications such as obstruction, perforation, and
peritonitis [18], which sometimes require surgery [13]. The
availability of an anthelmintic compound against Anisakis
larvae has the potential to shorten the clinical course and
preventmechanical complications that arise from endoscopic
procedures. The effectiveness of treatment with anthelmintic
agents, antibiotics, anticholinergics, and/or corticosteroids
against A. simplex remains controversial, and few studies
have shown the effectiveness of anthelmintic drugs againstA.
simplex [19].
Caesalpinia sappan L. is a traditional medicine plant that
is produced in Taiwan, China, India, Myanmar, Vietnam,
Sri Lanka, and Malay Peninsula [20]. The dried heartwood
of C. sappan L. has been used for a long time in oriental
folk medicines. It is traditionally applied as an aqueous
decoction and prescribed to invigorate the blood system,
promote menstruation, and reduce pain and swelling [21].
Additionally, C. sappan L. have been recommended for
medicinal purposes owing to its astringent or diuretic prop-
erties, as well as for treating certain skin diseases [22].
C. sappan L. extracts have been shown to exhibit anti-
inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-
tumor, antiatherosclerosis, hypoglycemic, and spasmolytic
activities and to promote blood flow [20]. Brazilein, the
unique tetracyclic homoisoflavonoid from C. sappan L., is
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3
a natural red pigment that is utilized in traditional Chinese
medicine [23]. Previous investigations have demonstrated
that brazilein exhibits a positive inotropic action in isolated
cardiac tissues and inhibits Na+, K+-ATPase activity, anti-
complementary activity on the immune system, and the scav-
enging of hydroxyl radicals [23, 24]. In lipopolysaccharide-
(LPS-)stimulated microglial BV2 cells, brazilein suppresses
the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-𝛼
(TNF-𝛼), and interleukin (IL)-6 and reduces the expression
of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) synthase, which may protect
the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injury [25]. Brazilein
partially inhibits rat aorta contractions that are induced by
ergometrine maleate (5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptor ago-
nist) [26]. Moreover, brazilein exhibits significant cytotoxic
activity against HepG2 and Hep3B (liver), MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 (breast), A549 (lung), and Ca9-22 (gingival) human
cancer cell lines [27]. Nevertheless, current investigations of
the anti-skin cancer properties of brazilein and its larvicidal
effects on H. nana and A. simplex are insufficient. This
study confirms the antioxidant and antitumor effects of
brazilein and elucidates novel mechanisms for its inhibition
of adipocyte differentiation, its larvicidal activity against H.
nana, and its elimination of the spontaneous mobility of A.
simplex.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Reagents and Cell Lines. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH∙), 2,2󸀠-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS∙+), 2,5,7,8-tetramethylchro-
man carboxylic acid (trolox), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxan-
thine (IBMX) were purchased form Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, USA). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, human epidermoid
carcinoma A431, human oral squamous cell carcinoma
SCC25, human skin malignant melanoma A375, mouse
leukemic monocyte macrophage RAW 264.7, and mouse
normal embryonic liver BNLCL2 cells were purchased from
theAmericanTypeCultureCollection (Rockville,MD,USA).
Human basal cell carcinoma BCC and human premalignant
keratinocytic HaCaT cells were kindly provided by Professor
Hamm-Ming Sheu (National Cheng Kung University
Medical College, Tainan, Taiwan). Cells were cultured
in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hazelton Product, Denver, PA, USA) and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin at 37∘C in 5% CO
2
humidified atmosphere;
specifically, SCC25 were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium
(GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with
0.4 𝜇g/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA),
3T3-L1, A431, A375, HaCaT, RAW 264.7 and BNLCL2 cells
in DMEM, and BCC cells in RPMI medium.
2.2. Extraction and Isolation of Brazilein. The dry powder
of C. sappan heartwood (33.0 kg) was extracted with 95%
ethanol at room temperature. After removal of the solvent
by evaporation, the residue (3.45 kg) was partitioned with
water and ethyl acetate (1 : 2). The ethyl acetate layer was
removed by evaporation and the residue was then sus-
pended in methanol-water (9.5 : 0.5) and partitioned with
n-hexane (1 : 1). The methanol layer was subjected to silica
gel column chromatography and eluted with n-hexane-ethyl
acetate (7.5 : 2.5, 1 : 1, 2.5 : 7.5), ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate-
methanol (1 : 1), and methanol, successively. Each fraction
collected from the column was monitored by thin-layer
chromatography and the similar fractions were combined
to produce 8 fractions. The fraction 4 was further purified
by silica gel column and eluted with n-hexane-ethyl acetate
(7.5 : 2.5, 1 : 1, 2.5 : 7.5) and ethyl acetate to isolate brazilein
(127.5 g). Their structures were confirmed by NMR and mass
spectra analysis.

(C-6a), 74.7 (C-6), 41.5 (C-7). These data were compared
with literature values [28]. The chemical of brazilein was
shown in Figure 1(a). The purity of brazilein is 99.3%. The
solubility of brazilein was 100mM in DMSO.
2.3. Radical Scavenging Ability against DPPH∙ and ABTS∙+ of
Brazilein. The free radical scavenging activities of brazilein
were determined by DPPH∙ and ABTS∙+ scavenging assays
as previously reported [29]. Briefly, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and
100 𝜇M brazilein (10 𝜇L of solution) was mixed with 90𝜇L of
dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 900𝜇L of ethanolicDPPH∙
solution (0.1mM). After incubation in darkness at 25∘C
for 30min, the absorbance (A) was determined at 517 nm
(HitachiU-2001, Japan).The inhibition percentage of ABTS∙+
radical as determined by the extent of decolorisation was
taken to be proportional to the concentration of antioxidants.
ABTS∙+ was dissolve in water to a 7mM concentration.
ABTS∙+ radical was produced by reacting ABTS∙+ stock
solution with 2.45mM potassium persulfate and the mixture
to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h. The
ABTS∙+ radical solution was diluted to an absorbance of
0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm at 30∘C. Each agent (0.1mL) was
reacted with 2.9mL of diluted ABTS∙+ radical solution for
20min at 30∘C, and then the absorbance was measured at
734 nm (Hitachi U-2001, Japan). TEAC (trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity) is calculated by comparison with the
reactivity of the standard, trolox. Ethanol or distilled water
was used as negative controls while trolox served as the
positive control. The ability of brazilein or trolox to DPPH∙
and ABTS∙+ scavenging activities was calculated using the
following equation: radical scavenging ability (%) = (1 −
𝐴 sample/𝐴control) × 100. Percentage scavenging activity was
calculated, while EC
50
valueswere estimated from the percent
inhibition versus concentration plot. The data are presented
as mean values ± standard deviation (n = 3).

tion of lipid peroxidation by brazilein (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

independent experiments; ∗𝑃 < 0.05 indicates significant difference from vehicle-treated cells.
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5
and 100 𝜇M) was determined by using the liposome as a
model of biological membranes, as described previously
[30]. Fe2+/ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation was used.
The liposomes were obtained by dispersing lipids in dem-
ineralized water (1 : 10). For the assay, 32 𝜇L of suspension of
liposomeswas incubated togetherwith 11𝜇L of 10mMFeSO
4
,
11 𝜇L of 10mM ascorbic acid, and appropriate amounts of
different concentrations (ranging from 0–100𝜇L/mL of stock
solution) of brazilein, trolox, and rutin in 1.515mL of 50mM

buffer, pH 7.4 (2.5ml final solution)
at 37∘C for 1 h. Lipid peroxidation was terminated by the
reaction of 0.8mL of 1% 2-thiobarbituric acid and 10%
trichloroacetic acid and 106 𝜇L of 0.1M ethylene diamine-
tetraacetic acid disodium salt dehydrate at 100∘C for 20min.
After cooling and centrifugation (2600 g for 10min), the
malonaldehyde content was determined by measuring the
absorbance (A) at 532 nm. A control with DMSO instead of
sample was also analyzed and expressed no activity. Trolox
and rutin were utilized as standards. The inhibition of lipid
peroxidation (%) = (1 − 𝐴 sample/𝐴control) × 100. Percentage
inhibition was calculated, while EC
50
values were estimated
from the percent inhibition versus concentration plot. The
data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation (n =
3).
2.5. Cell Viability. Cells (1 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded
in 100 𝜇L of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h to
allow the cells to attach, before treatment with brazilein.
Brazilein was dissolved in DMSO and made up with the
medium so that the final concentration of the vehicle was
not >0.1% DMSO. The cells were treated with brazilein
(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 𝜇M) for 72 h. Cell viability was
determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay as reported [31].
Absorbance values were expressed as a percentage of vehicle
controls (0.1% DMSO), and agents’ concentrations resulting
in cell growth inhibition of 50% (IC
50
) were calculated.
2.6. Adipocyte Differentiation, Treatment, and Oil Red O
Staining. Cultivation of 3T3-L1 cells and their conversion
to adipocytes were carried out according to the method as
described previously [32]. To induce differentiation, four-
day postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were stimulated for
72 h with 10% FBS/DMEM containing the MDI hormone
mixture (0.5mM IBMX, 1 𝜇Mdexamethasone, and 10 𝜇g/mL
of insulin) in six-well plates. On day four, the medium was
replacedwith 10%FBS/DMEMmedium containing 10𝜇g/mL
of insulin. The medium was replaced with fresh medium
(10% FBS/DMEM, 10 𝜇g/mL of insulin) every two days until
analysis on day eight. Brazilein (5 𝜇M) was added during the
differentiation process.
Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were stained using the Oil
Red O method [33]. At day eight of differentiation, the cells
were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formaldehyde
for 2 h. The fixed cells were washed with 60% isopropanol
and stained with 0.2% Oil Red O for 10min. The plates
were rinsed three times with water and examined under a
phase contrast inverted light microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U,
Japan). After throughwashingswithwater and evaporation of
excesswater,Oil RedOwas extracted in isopropyl alcohol and
the absorbancewasmonitored at 520 nm (BioTek, Synergy 2).
2.7. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis. 3T3-L1 cells were treated
with vehicle control (DMSO) or brazilein (5𝜇M) during the
differentiation process. Total RNA was isolated from cells
using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
and a RT-PCR was conducted using 3𝜇g of total RNA and
the Superscript cDNA Preamplification System (Weiterstadt,
Germany) according to the manufactures’ instructions. The
following primers were utilized: right primer 5󸀠-GCT CTA
GAC GTG ACA ATC TGT CTG AGG TCT GTC AT-3󸀠
and left primer 5󸀠-CGG CAT CCG TTG TCG GTT TCA
CAA ATG CCT TGC AGT G-3󸀠 for PPAR𝛾, and right
primer 5󸀠-ACC CAC ACT GTG CCC ATC TA-3󸀠 and left
primer 5󸀠-CGG AAC CGC TCA TTG CC-3󸀠 for 𝛽-actin.The
amplified RT-PCRproducts were analysed in 2% agarose gels,
visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and photographed
under ultraviolet light.
2.8. Morphology Change and Apoptotic Cells. For morpho-
logical analysis, after incubation of brazilein (5, 10, and
20𝜇M) for 72 h, the BCC cells in each well were washed
once with 1 × PBS, and analysis was performed using a
phase contrast inverted light microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U,
Japan). To assess specific apoptosis, cells (1 × 105 cells/mL)
were plated in 24-well plates and then treated with 5𝜇M
brazilein for 72 h. After incubation, cells were washed by
PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with
Hoechst 33342 (0.1 𝜇g/mL) at 37∘C for 10min in the dark.The
nuclearmorphology changeswere viewed under a fluorescent
microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U, Japan).
2.9. Caspase-3 Expression Analysis. For western blotting,
BCC cells (1 × 105 cells/mL) were treated with brazilein
(10 𝜇M) for 72 h. Then, cells were harvested, washed with
PBS, and incubated for 20min at 4∘C in 1mL of lysis buffer
containing 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5mM
EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N 󸀠,N 󸀠-
tetraacetic acid), 150MmNaCl, and 1mM phenylmethylsul-
fonyl fluoride (PMSF). The cell lysates containing 40 𝜇g of
solubilized protein were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk. Blots were
incubated with the antibodies against cleaved Caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology) and 𝛽-actin (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate
secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blotted antibodies were visu-
alized by chemiluminescence method (ECL kit, Amersham).
2.10. Preparation of H. nana Adult Worms. H. nana adult
worms were obtained from each part of the intestines of wild
type mice, purchased from Lin’s farm in Fengshan, Kaohsi-
ung, Taiwan.These parts of the intestine were the duodenum,
6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. The H. nana had an
average length of 5–50mm and were collected using a needle
with a blunt tip, before being placed in Petri dishes with 0.9%
NaCl and gentamycin (10mg/mL). They were then washed
several times. The adult worms were individually observed
under an inverted microscope and those that exhibited any
kind of internal or external damage were discarded.The adult
worms were then identified by their morphological features,
divided into groups, and placed in 24-well plates (which
contained cultivatedmedia RPMI-1640 plus 20%FBS, pH 7.4,
in an atmosphere of 95% O
2
/5% CO
2
, 37∘C). These culture
conditions have been shown to maximize the development
and survival of H. nana.
2.11. Assay of Oscillation and Peristalsis Activities of H. nana.
The aboveH. nana cultivated media were supplemented with
L-glutamine (2mM), penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin
(100mg/mL), and amphotericin B (0.25 𝜇g/mL), and then
the effects of brazilein at concentrations of 10, 50, and
100 𝜇M were tested. The survival and mobility of the adult
worm were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h using
a stereomicroscope. The oscillation and peristalsis states
of adult worms were scored blindly by two investigators.
Cestode activity was scored by monitoring both oscillation
and peristalsis. Oscillation was scored of movement at scolex
and neck for each second for 30 second, and then the highest
score was 30. Peristalsis record the contraction real times at
scolex and neck. All data were compared with the initial time
before the test compounds had been added.Worms death and
complete standstill as determined by none any oscillation and
peristalsis were appeared for 30 second (defined as death).
2.12. A. simplex Larvae Preparation. The A. simplex third-
stage larvae (AsL3) were obtained from the muscle and
peritoneum of fresh Trichiurus lepturus(largehead hairtail,
Atlantic cutlassfish) that were purchased from the fishmarket
of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The AsL3 had an average length of
20–22 mm and were collected using a needle with a blunt
tip, placed in Petri dishes with 0.9% NaCl, and washed
several times. The majority of the larvae were encysted,
but they quickly became excysted upon washing in NaCl
solution. They were individually observed under an inverted
microscope and those that showed any internal or external
damage were discarded. The larvae were then identified by
morphological features, divided into groups and placed in
24-well plates (which contained cultivatedmedia RPMI-1640
plus 20% FBS, pH 4.0, in an atmosphere of 95% O
2
/5% CO
2
,
37∘C). These culture conditions have been demonstrated to
provide for the maximum development and survival of A
[19, 34].
2.13. Assay of Lethal Efficacy and Loss of Spontaneous Mobility
of A. simplex. The above AsL3 cultivated media were sup-
plemented with L-glutamine (2mM), penicillin (100 IU/mL),
streptomycin (100mg/mL), and amphotericin B (0.25𝜇g/mL)
and tested of brazilein for 10, 100, and 200 𝜇M. The survival
and mobility of the larvae were assessed at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24,
48, and 72 h using a stereomicroscope. Two investigators
blindly scored the larvae as dead, with poor mobility or
with normal mobility. The percentage losses of spontaneous
motion during 3min periods immediately after incubation
and complete standstill were determined by stimulation 4-
5 h later (defined as death). The nematocidal activity was
modified according to a scoring system that was originally
developed by Kiuchi et al. [35] and Lin et al. [19].
2.14. Statistical Analysis. The results are expressed as mean±
standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences were esti-
mated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Dunnett’s test or the Tukey-Kramer test. A P value of 0.05 was
regarded as significant.Thedatawere analyzed and the figures
plotted using software (SigmaPlot Version 8.0 and SigmaStat
Version 2.03, Chicago, IL, USA).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Antioxidant Activity of Brazilein. The antioxidant capac-
ity of brazilein was evaluated by performing DPPH∙ and
ABTS∙+ tests. The scavenging of DPPH∙-radicals is routinely
performed as a preliminary test for estimating the antioxidant
activity of natural compounds [36]. The DPPH∙-radical
scavenging activity indicates the ability of an antioxidant
compound to donate electrons or hydrogens and thereby
become a more stable molecule. Figure 1(b) presents the
effects of brazilein (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 𝜇M)
and trolox on the scavenging activities of DPPH∙-radicals,
determined by spectrophotometry. The ability of brazilein to
scavenge DPPH∙ radicals increased with its concentration, as
does that of trolox, which is well known for its antioxidant
properties. The EC
50
values of brazilein for the scavenging
of DPPH∙-radicals were 27.6 𝜇M (brazilein) and 20.1𝜇M
(trolox).
The radical monocation of ABTS∙+ is carried out by the
oxidation of ABTS using potassium persulfate and is reduced
in the presence of the hydrogen-donating antioxidants [30].
Figure 1(c) displays the spectrophotometrically determined
activities of brazilein (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 𝜇M) and
trolox in scavengingABTS∙+-radicals.The EC
50
values for the
scavenging of ABTS∙+-radicals were 26.5 𝜇M (brazilein) and
25.0𝜇M (trolox). The TEACmethod is based on the capacity
of various substances to scavenge the ABTS∙+-radical cations
and the comparison of those capacities with that of a
standard antioxidant (trolox), using a dose-response curve.
The antioxidant capacity of brazilein that was measured as a
TEAC value, was 981.1mg of trolox/g.
Antioxidant activity can be evaluated by measuring the
ability of a substance to reduce the damage that is caused
by free radicals. Some mechanisms that are involved in
many human diseases, such as hepatocarcinogenesis, dia-
betes, malaria, acute myocardial infarction, and skin cancer
involve lipid peroxidation as a main source of membrane
damage [37]. To examine the potential mechanisms by which
brazilein prevents oxidative damage, the inhibition of lipid
peroxidation by brazilein was investigated by measuring the
malonaldehyde content. Figure 1(d) plots the concentration-
dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by brazilein (5,
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 𝜇M). The EC
50
values of the
inhibition of lipid peroxidation efficiency by brazilein, trolox,
and rutin were 14.5, 14.9, and 5.1 𝜇M, respectively. Although
the inhibition of lipid peroxidation activity by brazilein was
weaker than that by rutin, brazilein and trolox had similar
effects on lipid peroxidation.
Brazilein contains hydroxyl in phenol and hydroxyl
functional groups, which may be responsible for its ability
to scavenge free radicals and inhibit the formation of lipid
peroxyl radicals.
3.2. Brazilein Suppresses Intracellular Lipid Accumulation
during Adipocyte Differentiation. Increased body weight
has been reported to result in increased oxidative stress
[38]. Numerous studies have found elevated oxidative stress
biomarkers in obesity and have suggested that oxidative stress
may be the linking mechanism in the pathway leading from
obesity to obesity-related diseases [39]. Furthermore, obesity
has been shown to be associated with reduced antioxidant
defense mechanisms. The differentiation of murine 3T3-L1
fibroblasts into adipocytes is one of the most dramatic and
sensitive morphological alterations in cultured mammalian
cells. This cell model can be utilized to screen bioactive
molecules using adipogenesis profiles [40]. Excess adipo-
genesis caused abnormal adipokine secretion, which was
accompanied by changes in the endocrinological effects
of adipocytes on adipogenesis, inflammation, and energy
metabolism [41]. Brazilein has been found to exhibit anti-
oxidation and anti-inflammatory activities [25], and we
hypothesize that brazilein may inhibit the accumulation
of lipids. To quantify the effect of brazilein on adipocyte
differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells that were undergoing MDI-
induced differentiation were treated with brazilein (5𝜇M).
Following differentiation, the cells were fixed and stained
using Oil Red O to examine neutral fat deposition. As
displayed in Figure 2(a), brazilein reduced the accumulation
of lipid droplets within cells below that in MDI-treated
positive control cells. This result was further supported by
quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of cellular neutral
lipid content. As presented in Figure 2(b), the level of lipid
accumulation over eight days was 54.9% of that of the MDI-
treated positive control cells (100%). Adipogenesis is a dif-
ferentiation process by which undifferentiated preadipocytes
are converted to fully differentiated adipocytes, regulated by
a highly organized cascade of transcription factors such as
members of PPAR𝛾 [7]. To investigate whether the reduced
lipid accumulation in brazilein-treated cells was due to the
inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, we examined the
expression of adipogenic markers in 3T3-L1 cells. As shown
in Figure 2(c), addition of brazilein (5 𝜇M) suppressed the
expression of PPAR𝛾 significantly as revealed by RT-PCR. In
the present study, brazilein exhibited antioxidative properties
and may inhibit lipid accumulation, and have antiobesity
effects.
3.3. Effect of Brazilein on Cell Viability and Skin Cancer Cell
Apoptosis. The concept that consumption of antioxidant rich
foods may prevent cancer or improve treatment has been
supported by some studies. Results of these studies indi-
cate that vitamins and certain phytochemical antioxidants
including flavonoids and carotenoids, are effective against the
proliferation of various cancer cells [42]. Brazilein reportedly
inhibits the growth of several cancer cells, including liver,
breast, lung, and gingival cancer cells [27]. The IC
50
values of
brazileinwere 11.3 and 12.2 𝜇Mfor human liver cancerHepG2
andHep3B cells, 8.4 and 14.1 𝜇M for breast cancerMDA-MB-
231 andMCF-7 cells, 34.6 𝜇M for lung cancer A549 cells, and
30.8 𝜇M for gingival cancer Ca9-22 cells [27]. However, the
antitumor effect of brazilein on human skin cancer cells is
not fully understood. In this study, the cytotoxic activity of
brazilein against human skin cancer cells (epidermoid carci-
noma A431 cells, basal cell carcinoma BCC cells, squamous
cell carcinoma SCC25 cells, and malignant melanoma A375
cells) was investigated by MTT assay, and relevant results are
plotted in Figure 3(a). After 72 h of treatment, brazilein (5, 10,
20, 30, 40, and 50 𝜇M) had significant antiskin cancer effects
against A431, BCC, SCC25, and A375 cancer cells by affecting
cell proliferation; the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent.
The IC
50
values of brazilein against skin cancer cells were
7.0𝜇M (A431), 4.5 𝜇M (BCC), 13.0 𝜇M (SCC25), and 20.2𝜇M
(A375).
The morphological changes in skin cancer cells that
had been treated with brazilein were studied to determine
whether a particular mechanism of death was responsible
for the decrease in viability of those cells. As displayed
in Figure 3(b), under phase-contrast-inverted microscopic
examination, the treatment of BCC cells with brazilein (5, 10,
and 20𝜇M) for 72 h caused the cells to lose their shape, the
cell bodies to become rounded, and the cells subsequently
to detach from the surface. After the BCC cells had been
treated with brazilein (5𝜇M) for 72 h, nuclear condensation,
shrinking, and fragmentation were identified by Hoechst
33342 staining under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 4(c)).
Apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, DNA fragmen-
tation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic bodies [31]. The
experimental data herein suggest that brazilein-treated BCC
cells die and exhibit the morphological features of apoptosis.
Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are expressed
in almost all types of cell as inactive proenzymes. Extensive
evidence suggests that the activation of caspase triggers the
apoptotic process in various cells. Caspase-3 has a pivotal role
in the terminal phase of apoptosis [43]. To determinewhether
caspases are involved in the brazilein-induced apoptosis of
skin cancer cells, the caspase-3 expression of BCC cells was
investigated by western blotting following the exposure of
those cells to brazilein (10 𝜇M) for 72 h (Figure 3(d)). The
experimental results thus obtained suggest that brazilein
induces cell apoptosis via caspase-dependent cell death path-
ways in skin cancer cells.
The cytotoxic effects of brazilein on noncancerous cells
(human premalignant keratinocytic HaCaT cells and mouse
embryonic liver BNLCL2 cells) and mouse leukemic mono-
cyte macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were examined by MTT
assay. As shown in Figure 3, treatment with brazilein for
72 h resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in HaCaT and
RAW 26.47 cell viability. However, the inhibitory effect of
brazilein in BNLCL2 cell viability was largely refractory. The

IC
50
values of brazilein against HaCaT, BNLCL2, and RAW
264.7 cells were 17.7 𝜇M, >50 ÎĲm, and 28.2𝜇M, respectively.
These experimental results suggest that the inhibition of cell
growth by brazilein is greater for skin cancer cells (A431, BCC,
and SCC25) than for A375, RAW 264.7, and noncancerous
cells (HaCaT and BNLCL2).
3.4. Cestocidal Activity against H. nana. Figures 5(a) and
5(b) plot the time course of oscillation and peristalsis during
brazilein treatment. In oscillation activity assay, vehicle con-
trol (0.1% DMSO) was decreased 17% from 72 h cultivation
(Figure 5(a)). However, in the peristalsis activity assay, vehicle
control (0.1% DMSO) was decreased 30% from 72 h cultiva-
tion (Figure 5(b)). The change of peristalsis of H. nana was
more sensitive than did oscillation by treatment of vehicle.
Treatment with 10, 50, and 100 𝜇M brazilein has a greater
effect of peristalsis than did oscillation for 24, 48, and 72 h.
Peristalsis activity disappeared before oscillation activity was
lost whenH. nanawas dead. In fact,H. nana has no peristalsis
or oscillation effect when it is dead.
In the oscillation activity assay (Figure 5(a)), exposure to
100 𝜇Mbrazilein for 48 h caused the death of 100%ofH. nana.

and rounded cell bodies (phase-contrast-inverted microscopic, 200x). (c) Nuclear morphological changes caused by brazilein in BCC cells.
BCC cells were treated with (+) or without (−) brazilein (5𝜇M) for 72 h, and then the nuclear was stained with Hoechst 33342. Under a
fluorescent microscope, apoptotic cells (arrows) were characterized by marked nuclear condensation, shrinking, and fragmentation (200x).
(d) Activation of caspase-3 induced by brazilein. BCC cells were treated with (+) or without (−) brazilein (10𝜇M) for 72 h, and the caspase-3
and 𝛽-actin expressions were determined by western blot.
Treatment with brazilein (a concentration of 50 or 100𝜇M
but not 10 𝜇M) for 48 and 72 h reduced the oscillation up
to 60% and 100%, respectively. Brazilein at a concentration
of 100 𝜇M slowly reduced oscillation from 2 to 72 h. Other
concentrations of brazilein reduced the oscillation activity
but did not cause death. Brazilein reduced the oscillation
activity of H. nana in a time- and dose-dependent manner
for 24 to 72 h (Figure 5(a)).
The effect of brazilein over time of the peristalsis activity
of H. nana was investigated (Figure 5(b)). In general, in
peristalsis activity assay, a dose- and time-dependent effect
for 24 to 72 h was also observed by treatment with brazilein.
Treatment for 24 hwith 50 and 100𝜇Mbrazilein stoppedperi-
stalsis in more than approximately 75% of worms. Brazilein
at 100𝜇M slowly reduced peristalsis from 2 to 72 h. It killed
all worms. Brazilein at a concentration of 50 and 100𝜇M

brazilein for 24–72 h did notmeasurably affect larvae survival
(data not shown). The time course of the brazilein-induced
loss of mobility on AsL3 was also studied. As shown in

whereas up to 10%of the larvae had ceasedmovement activity
at 72 h of treatment with 200𝜇M (Figure 6). Additionally,
the maximum loss of spontaneous movement occurred at a
concentration of 200𝜇M for 72 h. Generally, brazilein caused
a dose- and time-dependent loss of spontaneous movement.
However, the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) had no effect on AsL3.
Free radical scavenging activities have been involved in
some pathological conditions such as inflammatory diseases,
cancer, and aging [44]. Some agents have been found to have
antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities, at least partially, by
means of an antioxidant property, though they were not sure
to what extent this affected anthelminthic activity [45–47].
Otherwise, free radical scavengingmay reduce anthelminthic
activity by permitting larvae survival [48].
Therefore, it is still not clear how free radical savaging
may affect worms survival of certain anthelminthic agents.
In this study, we first identified brazilein has antiparasitic
activities onAsL3 ofA. simplex and adult worms ofH. nana in
vitro, and then used DPPH and ABTS∙+ scavenging assay and
inhibition of lipid peroxidation assay to determinewhether or
12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
not there was an association between the possible scavenger
activity of brazilein and its anthelminthic activity against A.
simplex and H. nana.
This study is the first to determine the anthelminthic
activity of brazilein on A. simplex and H. nana. Thus we
found that brazilein has not only anthelminthic activity for
L3 of A. simplex and adult worms of H. nana but also radical
scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS∙+ and inhibit
the formation of lipid peroxyl radicals. So brazilein with
radical scavenging activity has not reduced its anthelminthic
activity but further investigations for the mode of brazilein
actions or/and mechanisms for its anthelminthic effects
between free radical scavenging activity and inhibition of
lipid peroxidation relationship are necessary. These results
might be useful in the search of more selective and efficient
naturally anthelminthic compounds.
4. Conclusion
These results reveal that brazilein, a purified substance from
Caesalpinia sappan L., scavenges free radicals and inhibits
lipid peroxidation, indicating antioxidation activity. This
is the first study in which brazilein is found to suppress
the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes.
Treatment with brazilein reduced the intracellular accumu-
lation of neutral lipids and suppressed the induction of
PPAR𝛾. Furthermore, this study presented evidence that
skin cancer cells are sensitive to brazilein-induced cytotoxic
effects, which are mediated by the induction of apoptosis via
a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Additionally, studies have
shown that brazilein has a stronger anthelminthic effect
on H. nana than on A. simplex. These results support the
development of selective and efficient natural anthelminthic
compounds against helmineth or cestode. In the DPPH∙ and
ABTS∙+ scavenging assays, the ability of brazilein to scavenge
radicals was evaluated. Previous evidence has established
that larvicide activity toward A. simplex dose not depend on
scavenging activity and also that free radicals can be harmful
to A. simplex, in which case the scavenging of these free
radicals permits larvae to survive. However, this study is
the first that brazilein eliminates the spontaneous movement
of AsL3, has cestocidal effects against H. nana exhibits
scavenging activity against DPPH∙ and ABTS∙+ radicals, and
inhibits the formation of lipid peroxyl radicals. Therefore,
the radical scavenging activity of brazilein does not reduce
its ability to stop the spontaneous movement of AsL3 and or
its cestocidal effects on H. nana. Further investigations must
be conducted to elucidate the anthelminthic mechanisms
of brazilein against A. simplex and H. nana and its ability
to eliminate the spontaneous movement of A. simplex and
H. nana and their relationships to free radical scavenging
activity.
