RESUMO: “Constituintes químicos de Swartzia apetala Raddi var. glabra e avaliação da 
atividade antifúngica contra espécies de Candida”. Do extrato hexânico da madeira de Swartzia 
apetala Raddi var. glabra foram isolados um estilbeno (1), uma flavanona (2), um pterocarpano 
(3), um triterpeno (4) e uma mistura de esteróides (5 a 7). O extrato bruto e as substâncias isoladas 
foram submetidas à avaliação do potencial antifúngico usando nove cepas padrão ATCC do gênero 
Candida. Entre as substâncias testadas apenas o triterpeno (4) e a mistura de esteróides (5 a 7) não 
apresentaram  atividade. As estruturas das substâncias foram determinadas através da análise dos 
espectros de CG/EM, e RMN (1D e 2D) e comparação com dados da literatura.

ABSTRACT: From the hexanic extract of the stem from Swartzia apetala Raddi var. glabra were 
isolated one stilbene (1), one flavanone (2), one pterocarpan (3), one triterpene (4) and a mixture of 
three steroids (5 to 7). The crude  extract and the compounds isolated were submitted to evaluation 
of the antifungal activity against nine yeast standard ATCC of the Candida genus. Among the 
compounds only the triterpene (4) and the mixture of steroids (5 to 7) showed no activity. The 
structures of the compounds were determined by spectral data analysis of GC/MS and 1H and 13C 
NMR (1D and 2D experiments), as well as comparison with literature values.
Keywords: Swartzia apetala, antifungal activity, stilbene, flavonoids, terpenoids.
INTRODUCTION
The Swartzia genus (Fabaceae-Papilonoideae) 
comprehend about 130-140 species and only nine were 
chemically studied (Formiga et al., 1974; Braz-Filho et 
al., 1980; Sanchez et al., 1999; Magalhães et al., 2003; 
Rojas et al., 2006).
Swartzia apetala Raddi var. glabra is popularly 
known in Brazil as “arruda rajada” and has been used 
in civil construction and hydraulic workmanships on 
the basis of this large durability and impenetrability to 
marine worm (Rizzini and Mors, 1995), but yet without 
report of phytochemical investigation and evaluation of 
biological activity. 
The yeast Candida is a widespread opportunistic 
pathogen. Mucocutaneous infections, that manifest as 
both oral and vaginal ‘thrush’ are commonly encountered 
and the incidence of systemic candidiasis has risen 
dramatically over the past decades in parallel with the 
increasing sophistication of medicinal technology and 
widespread use of aggressive therapeutic regimens 
for transplantation and cancer patients. With this is 
necessary and urgent the identification of novel bioactive 
compounds. Candida species are among the main fungi 
causing nosocomial infections (Rangel-Fausto et al., 
1999; Aguiar et al., 2008), and other clinical human 
diseases special attention to HIV positive patients 
(Jadhav and Mishra, 2003).
This paper reports the first phytochemical 
study and evaluation of the biological activity from S. 
apetala Raddi var. glabra, allowing the isolation and 
characterization of the compounds (E)-3-hydroxy-
5-methoxystilbene (3-methoxy-5-styrylphenol, 
1), (-)-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone (pinocembrin, 2), 
( - ) -3-hydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan 
(maackiain, 3), 5a-lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (lupeol 4) and 
a mixture of (24-methylcholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3β-ol, 
campesterol, 5), stigmast-5-en-3β-ol (24-ethylcholest-
5-en-3β-ol, β-sitosterol, 6) and 24-ethylcholesta-
5,22(E)-dien-3β-ol (stigmasta-5,22(E)-dien-3β-ol, 
stigmasterol, 7) by spectral data (GC/MS, 1D and 2D 
NMR) and comparison with literature values, together

Chemical constituents from Swartzia apetala Raddi var. glabra and evaluation of their antifungal activity against Candida spp.
with evaluation of the antifungal activity against nine 
yeast standard ATCC of the Candida genus. 
EXPERIMENTAL
General procedures
Melting points are uncorrected. The 1H and 
13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL Eclipse 
spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz respectively, in 
CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal 
standard. Mass spectra were obtained with CGMS-QP 
5050 SHIMADZU (EI, 70 eV). Optical rotation was 
measured with Perkin-Elmer 343 polarimeter at the 
sodium-D line.
Plant material
Swartzia apetala Raddi var. glabra was 
collected in Forest Reserve Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) 
in November 1996, Espírito Santo, Brazil. The specimen 
was authenticated by the botanical identifier Domingos 
A. Folly by comparison with voucher of the herbarium 
company (nº 395). 
Extraction and isolation
The dried stem of S. apetala (0.58 kg) was 
powdered and successively extracted by maceration at 
room temperature with hexane, CH2Cl2 and methanol. 
The hexane extract (2.3 g) was submitted to partition with 
EtOAc to obtain two fractions F1 and F2. The fraction 
soluble in EtOAc F1 was chromatographed on a silica 
gel column using a hexane-CH2Cl2-methanol gradient 
obtaining 38 fractions of 50 mL that were reunited of 
according to chromatographic profile resulting in four 
fractions (F1A, F1B, F1C and F1D). The fraction F1B 
(110 mg) was purified by column chromatography on 
silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-methanol 
gradient to obtain compounds 3-methoxy-5-styrylphenol 
(1, 7.0 mg) and pinocembrin {2, 18.0 mg; m.p. 196-
198 ºC; [a]D - 57º (c 0.003, CHCl3)}. The fraction F1C 
(355 mg) was subjected to the same procedure used to 
F1B, obtaining 25 fractions of 50 mL and the fractions 
were reunited in three fractions (F1C-1 to F1C-3).  The 
fraction F1C-1 (21 mg) was purified by preparative 
TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2 (3:2) as eluent afforded the 
pterocapan maackiain {3, 13.0 mg; m.p. 180-185 ºC; 
[a]D - 268º (c 0.02, CHCl3)}. Fraction F1C-3 (33.5 mg) 
was also subjected to preparative TLC using hexane-
EtOAc (4:1) as eluent and afforded triterpenoid lupeol 
(4, 13 mg; m.p. 213-215 ºC). Fraction F1D (230 mg) 
was chromatographed on silica gel column flash using 
petroleum ether-EtOAc (8:2) and obtained a mixture (35 
mg).of the steroids campesterol (5), β-sitosterol (6) and 
stigmasterol (7). 
Bioassay
The evaluation of the potential antifungal of the 
extract and the isolated compounds was evaluated by 
the agar diffusion method (Hadaceck & Greger, 2000). 
The yeasts inocula (100 μL) were spread on the surface 
of Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco, USA) in 100 mm 
x 17 mm plates Petri dishes by using a swab (Venturi, 
Transystem, Copan Innovation, Italy). The colonies

yeasts were suspended in sterile saline and read by 
photometry (Densimat, bioMérieux, France) adjusted 
to nº 0.5 McFarland scale (106 CFU/mL). Afterwards, 
5.0 mm of diameter wells were perforated and filled 
with 50 μL of the extract (25 mg/mL) and 50 μL of 
the compounds isolated (1.0 mg/mL). The plates were 
incubated at 37 ºC for 36 hours. All tests were carried 
out in triplicates. Myconazole nitrate (Vodol® batch 
606401, União Química, Brazil) (50 µL; 1.0 mg/mL) 
was used as positive control. Solvent control (absolute 
ethanol) was included in each experiment as negative 
control. The antifungal activity was measured as the 
diameter (mm) of clear zone around wells containing 
all products tested. The yeast utilized were Candida 
albicans ATCC 36802, C. lusitaneae ATCC 34449, C. 
guillermondii ATCC 6260, C. glabrata ATCC 2001, C. 
inconspicua ATCC 16783, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, 
C. krusei ATCC 34135, C. tropicalis ATCC 13803 and 
C. spp. 34147.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The identification of the compounds 1-7 
involved comparison of the spectral data, obtained 
through GC/MS, 1D and 2D NMR analysis, with 
values described in the literature for 5-hydroxy-
3-methoxystilbene 1, (Ngo & Brown, 1998), 
5,7-dihydroxyflavanone 2, (Markham & Chari, 1976), 
3-hydroxy-8,9- methylenedioxypterocarpan 3, (Bedir et 
al., 1999), lupeol 4, (Campos et al., 1991; Zanon et al., 
2008) and a mixture of steroids campesterol 5, sitosterol 
6 and stigmasterol 7 (Seo et al., 1988). Two of these 
compounds (1 and 2) are being reported by first time in 
the Swartzia genus (Figure 1).
The screening of the antifungal activity in 
vitro of the hexanic extract of the stem of S. apetala 
and the compounds isolated against nine yeast of the 
Candida genus are show in the Table 1. Compared with 
the positive control results, the activity of the extract 
may be due to the synergic effect of the three active 
compounds together. From the results obtained with the 
three compounds the compounds 1 and 2 showed activity 
against most of yeast analyzed with inhibition zone 
values of ((15 ± 0.05 mm) C. albicans, (16 ± 0.08 mm) 
C. parapsilosis and (16 ± 0.09 mm) C. guillermondii for 
the compound 1. Activity of the compound 2 towards 
C. albicans (14 ± 0.05 mm) and C. parapsilosis (15 ± 
0.06 mm) were similar to compound 1. Amongst the 
three compounds tested, the compound 3 was the less 
active showing as most significant result against C. 
guillermondii (13 ± 0.05 mm) and no inhibition against 
C. glabrata. The other compounds showed no inhibition 
halo.
