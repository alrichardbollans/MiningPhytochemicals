Abstract
Background:  The anticancer drug Ukrain (NSC-631570) which has been specified by the
manufacturer as semisynthetic derivative of the Chelidonium majus L. alkaloid chelidonine and the
alkylans thiotepa was reported to exert selective cytotoxic effects on human tumour cell lines in
vitro. Few clinical trials suggest beneficial effects in the treatment of human cancer. Aim of the
present study was to elucidate the importance of apoptosis induction for the antineoplastic activity
of Ukrain, to define the molecular mechanism of its cytotoxic effects and to identify its active
constituents by mass spectrometry.
Methods: Apoptosis induction was analysed in a Jurkat T-lymphoma cell model by fluorescence
microscopy (chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation), flow cytometry (cellular
shrinkage, depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-activation) and
Western blot analysis (caspase-activation). Composition of Ukrain was analysed by mass
spectrometry and LC-MS coupling.
Results: Ukrain turned out to be a potent inducer of apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that
Ukrain induced depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases.
Lack of caspase-8, expression of cFLIP-L and resistance to death receptor ligand-induced apoptosis
failed to inhibit Ukrain-induced apoptosis while lack of FADD caused a delay but not abrogation of
Ukrain-induced apoptosis pointing to a death receptor independent signalling pathway. In contrast,
the broad spectrum caspase-inhibitor zVAD-fmk blocked Ukrain-induced cell death. Moreover,
over-expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and expression of dominant negative caspase-9 partially reduced
Ukrain-induced apoptosis pointing to Bcl-2 controlled mitochondrial signalling events.

However, mass spectrometric analysis of Ukrain failed to detect the suggested trimeric chelidonine
thiophosphortriamide or putative dimeric or monomeric chelidonine thiophosphortriamide
intermediates from chemical synthesis. Instead, the Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids chelidonine,
sanguinarine, chelerythrine, protopine and allocryptopine were identified as major components of
Ukrain.
Apart from sanguinarine and chelerythrine, chelidonine turned out to be a potent inducer of
apoptosis triggering cell death at concentrations of 0.001 mM, while protopine and allocryptopine
were less effective. Similar to Ukrain, apoptosis signalling of chelidonine involved Bcl-2 controlled
mitochondrial alterations and caspase-activation.
Conclusion: The potent proapoptotic effects of Ukrain are not due to the suggested "Ukrain-
molecule" but to the cytotoxic efficacy of Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids including chelidonine.
Background
The anticancer drug Ukrain has been specified by
Nowicky Pharma (Vienna, Austria) as semi-synthetic
derivative of thiotepa and the alkaloid chelidonine, a
main component of the plant greater celandine (Chelido-
nium majus L., Papaveraceae) [1-3]. In the postulated
molecular structure one central thiophosphortriamide
molecule is surrounded by three molecules of chelido-
nine, which are bound in a covalent manner (Fig. 1).
During the last decades pre-clinical investigations pointed
to promising antineoplastic activity of Ukrain. In these
studies, Ukrain was suggested to exert selective cytotoxic
effects on tumour cells without adverse side effects on
normal cells and tissues [4]. Recently, Ukrain was also
shown to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis of Lewis
carcinoma in C57Bl6 mice [5]. Moreover, a recent report
revealed radiosensitizing effects of Ukrain on human
colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro, while nor-
mal human fibroblasts were protected against the cyto-
toxic effects of ionizing radiation [6]. However, the
observations on selective cytotoxicity of Ukrain are still
subject to controversial discussion [7]. In addition to the
above mentioned promising pre-clinical data, some clini-
cal investigations predominantly from Eastern Europe
suggested beneficial effects of Ukrain in the treatment of
patients suffering e.g. from bladder, breast, pancreatic,
rectal or colorectal cancer when given as single drug or in
combination with standard chemotherapeutic drugs or
ionizing radiation (recently reviewed by [8]). However,
the molecular mechanisms of Ukrain-induced antineo-
plastic effects are not yet completely understood. Apart
from suggested immunomodulatory effects, induction of
a growth arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and/or
induction of apoptosis may be involved [7,9-13].
Apoptosis constitutes a highly regulated, physiological
form of cell death involving complex intracellular prote-
olysis. In this scenario, specialized intracellular cysteine
proteases known as caspases constitute central execution-
ers of apoptosis that cleave a multitude of cellular sub-
strates triggering morphological alterations and finally
cell death [14]. There is accumulated evidence that cas-
pases can either be activated by the extrinsic, death recep-
tor dependent or the intrinsic, death receptor-
independent mitochondrial pathway. Death receptor lig-
ands, such as CD95 or TRAIL, trigger clustering of their
respective receptors in the cytoplasmic membrane with
recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD (Fas associated
Death Domain) and pro-caspase-8 to form a multimeric
death receptor-inducing complex (DISC). Proximity of
several pro-caspase-8 molecules in the DISC allows auto-
proteolytic cleavage and thus activation of this initiator
caspase with subsequent cleavage of downstream effector
caspases such as caspase-3, -6 and -7 [15]. In contrast,
application of cellular stress mostly triggers the so-called
mitochondrial death pathway that critically involves dis-
ruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential with
release of proapoptotic proteins including cytochrome c
from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the
cytosol [16]. Release of cytochrome c culminates in the
activation of pro-caspase-9 within a multimeric cytosolic
death inducing complex, the apoptosome. Similar to cas-
pase-8, the initiator caspase-9 triggers activation of the
effector caspase-cascade that finally executes cell death
[17-19]. A mitochondrial amplification loop mediated by
caspase-8 triggered cleavage of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 pro-
tein Bid yielding truncated Bid (tBid) and tBid mediated
release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-
membrane space constitutes a molecular link between the
death receptor and the mitochondrial pathway that
assures execution of apoptosis in cells with low initial cas-
pase-8 cleavage upon death receptor stimulation [20].
Inversely, dependent on the cell line, complete activation
of mitochondria and subsequent execution of drug-
induced apoptosis may rely on a mitochondrial amplifica-
tion loop mediated by caspase-3 and caspase-8 [21].
Induction of apoptosis is a common mechanism of the
cytotoxic action of most DNA-damaging drugs and irradi-BMC Cancer 2006, 6:14 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/14

ation. However, tumour cells are often characterized by
alterations in genes coding for proteins involved in apop-
tosis and survival signalling [22,23]. In this regard,
increased levels of anti-apoptotic or decreased levels of
pro-apoptotic proteins can cause acquired or intrinsic
resistance against apoptosis induction by DNA-damaging
antineoplastic drugs and ionizing radiation thereby con-
tributing to treatment failure and poor clinical prognosis
[24]. Thus, novel agents targeting aberrant apoptosis path-
ways or inducing alternative death pathways may be
suited to overcome treatment resistance [16,25-34].
The putative proapoptotic and radiosensitizing effects
together with its reported selective action on tumour cells
make Ukrain an interesting novel agent for cancer treat-
ment as single drug and in combination with radiation
therapy. However, data regarding the cytotoxic activity of
the drug are still conflicting and the molecular mecha-
nisms of Ukrain-triggered cell death are not yet under-
stood. Moreover, concerns about the chemical purity of
this semisynthetic drug emerged [35].
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize
the apoptosis inducing capacity of Ukrain, to elucidate
molecular mechanisms of Ukrain-induced apoptosis and
to analyse the chemical identity of the drug preparation.
Methods
Chemicals and drugs
The pharmaceutical preparation "Ukrain" (NSC-631570)
with an indicated concentration of 1 mg/ml "Ukrain-mol-
ecule") was obtained from Nowicky Pharmaceuticals
(Vienna, Austria). Chelidonine, protopine, allocryp-
topine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine and thiotepa were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). For
in vitro investigations the alkaloids were dissolved in water
(allocryptopine, chelerythrine and protopine), DMSO
(chelidonine) or methanol (sanguinarine) as 1 mM, 10
mM or 100 mM stock solutions.
A native extract of greater celandine (Chelidonium majus
L.) was obtained from Caelo & Loretz GmbH (Hilden,
Germany). As indicated by the manufacturer the extract
solution contained 0.35% (w/w) alkaloids as calculated
from the content of chelidonine as major alkaloid compo-
nent. For experimental use, the stock solution was
adjusted to 1 mM chelidonine.
Etoposide and the pan-caspase-inhibitor zVAD-fmk were
purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, USA)
and dissolved in DMSO. TMRE was obtained from Molec-
ular Probes (Mobitec, Goettingen, Germany) and dis-
solved as a 25 µM stock solution in water. Hoechst 33342
and propidium iodide were purchased from Calbiochem
(Bad Soden, Germany) and from Sigma (Munich, Ger-
many), respectively, and dissolved in distilled water.
Trypan Blue was from Sigma (Munich, Germany) and
used as 0.04% solution for cytotoxicity assays.
Rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3, rabbit anti-Bad, rabbit anti-
PARP- and rabbit anti-cleaved PARP antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt, Germany). Anti-
caspase-9-antibody and polyclonal rabbit anti-Bak-NT
were purchased from Upstate (Biomol, Hamburg, Ger-
many). Monoclonal mouse anti-caspase-8-mouse-anti-
body directed against the p18 subunit was obtained from
BioCheck (Münster, Germany)[19]. Monoclonal mouse
anti-Bcl-2 mouse-antibody was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotech (Heidelberg, Germany). Polyclonal rabbit
anti-Bim was purchased from Pharmingen (Becton Dick-
inson, Heidelberg, Germany) and rabbit anti-Bid from R
& D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Horse-radish perox-
idase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased
from Santa-Cruz-Biotech (Heidelberg, Germany; anti-rab-
bit and anti-mouse) and Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech
(Freiburg, Germany; anti-sheep), respectively. All other
chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Munich, Germany)
if not otherwise specified.

expressing Jurkat cells, caspase-8 and FADD-negative Jur-
kat cells, CD95/TRAIL-resistant Jurkat A3 as well as Bcl-2
overexpressing Jurkat cells and the respective mock trans-
fected control cells (Jurkat Vector) were used as already
described [19,36,37]. Jurkat J16 control cells as well as
cFLIP-L expressing Jurkat cells were kindly provided by J.
Tschopp, Epalinges, Switzerland [38]. Jurkat cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (Invitrogen-Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany)
and 100 U/ml penicilline and 100 µg/ml streptomycine
(Invitrogen-Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) and maintained
in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Irradiation was performed with 6 MV photons from a Sie-
mens Mevatron linear accelerator with a dose rate of 4 Gy
per min at room temperature.
Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity of Ukrain was measured by standard live-
dead staining. To this end, cells were incubated for 10 min
with Trypan Blue staining solution (0.04%). The number
of viable (transparent) and dead (blue) cells was deter-
mined by light microscopic analysis.
Determination of apoptosis
Cell death was analysed by fluorescence microscopy upon
combined staining of the cells with Hoechst 33342 and
propidium iodide. In brief, cells were incubated for 15
min with Hoechst 33342 (1.5 µM) or with Hoechst 33342
(1.5 µM) and propidium iodide (2.5 µg/ml) where indi-
cated. Cell morphology was then determined by fluores-
cence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) using an excitation wavelength filter of 380
nm. Cells were analysed with 40fold magnification and
documented using a CCD camera device (Zeiss Axiocam
MRm). At least 250 cells were counted for each value.
Moreover, cell death was quantified by flow cytometry
using light scatter characteristics employing a FACS Cali-
bur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Ger-
many).
Determination of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆ψm) was
analysed by flow cytometry using the ∆ψm-specific stain
TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethylester perchlorate)
(Molecular Probes, Mobitech, Göttingen Germany). To
this end, cells were loaded for 30 min at 37°C with 25 nM
TMRE and subsequently analysed by flow cytometry. Pre-
incubation with 1 µM of the proton ionophore CCCP
(carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone) was used
as a positive control for complete depolarisation.
Determination of caspase-activation
Caspase activation was determined by Western blot anal-
ysis of cytosolic extracts upon treatment with Ukrain or
defined alkaloid preparations. To this end, cells were
resuspended in 3fold concentrated lysis buffer (final con-
centration: 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS,
10% (v/v) Glycerol, 50 mM DDT, 0.01% (w/v) bromphe-
nol-blue in PBS) and subsequently boiled for 10 min at
100°C.
Ten µl lysate (corresponding to 105 cells) were separated
by SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted onto PVDF-mem-
branes (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Equal protein
loading was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining.
Blots were blocked for 1 h in TBS buffer containing 0.05%
Tween 20 and 5% non fat dried milk (3% non fat dried
milk in case of caspase-9 antibody). The membrane was
then incubated over night at 4°C with the respective pri-
mary antibodies. After repeated washings with PBS/
Tween-20 (0.05%) the membrane was incubated with the
respective secondary antibody (1:10 000) in TBS/Tween
for 1 h at room temperature and again washed several
times with TBS/Tween. The detection of antibody binding
was performed by enhanced chemoluminescence staining
(ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham-Phar-
macia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany).
In addition, caspase activation was quantified using the
CaspACE® FITC-VAD-fmk in situ marker which consists of
a FITC-conjugate of the cell permeable pan-caspase-inhib-
itor VAD-fmk (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Within
the cell the inhibitor binds to activated caspases and
serves as in situ marker for caspase-activation. CaspACE®-
staining was performed according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
Chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric 
investigations of Chelidonium majus extract and the 
pharmaceutical preparation Ukrain (NSC-631570)
Dissolution of extract and Ukrain prior to analysis
Before analysis both the Chelidonium majus L. extract and
Ukrain were diluted with methanol/water. Ten µl of Che-
lidonium majus extract were diluted with 500 µl methanol/
water (90/10, v/v), stirred for 10 min, centrifuged and the
brown supernatant was used for analyis. Twenty µl of
Ukrain were diluted with 100 µl methanol/water (90/10,
v/v), and the light green solution was used for further
investigations. In each case 10 µl of the particle free meth-
anolic/water solutions were injected into the HPLC sys-
tem coupled to ESI-MS interface.
High-performance-liquid-chromatography
The HPLC system consisted of a Surveyor quaternary
pump (Thermo Finnigan; San Jose, California; USA), Sur-BMC Cancer 2006, 6:14 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/14

veyor PDA detector (UV-range scanned: 200–800 nm in 5
nm intervals) and Surveyor autosampler. Reversed-phase
chromatography was carried out on a Grom Saphir 110
C8, (3 µm, 150 × 2 mm) column (Grom Analytik; Rotten-
burg, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of water +
0.1% formic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile + 0.1% for-
mic acid (eluent B); flow rate was 200 µl/min. Formic acid
was necessary for improving peak shape. The gradient was
applied as follows: 0 min: 100% A – 5 min: 100% A – 1
min: 95% A – 50 min: 50% A – 55 min: 50% A – 56 min:
100% A. The column was washed with pure methanol
and pure acetonitrile after each run for 15 min and equil-
ibrated with 100% A for 3 min.
Electrospray and MS settings
All mass spectra were obtained using a Thermo Finnigan
(San Jose, California; USA) TSQ Quantum triple quadru-
pole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray
interface coupled to the Surveyor HPLC-system and oper-
ated in positive ionisation mode. For data processing the
Xcalibur 1.3 software was used. The ESI-interface was
locked in a 90° position towards the orifice and operated
at 3.8 kV. Capillary temperature and sheath gas were set to
320°C and 30 (arbitrary) units, respectively. Auxillary gas
was set to 12 (arbitrary) units to enhance signal intensity.
Full scan MS scans
Conventional (non MS/MS) full scans in centroid mode
using the third quadrupole as mass selector (Q3 full scan)
were recorded in the range of m/z 100–1000 within a
dwell time of 0.7 s. Source CID (collision induced frag-
mentation) voltage was 10 V, which minimizes analyte-
solvent adducts.
MS/MS product ion scans
Within one LC-MS run up to four product ion scans for
different precursor masses were combined. Source CID
voltage was set to constant value of 10 V and collision
energy to 35 V (for 354.1 m/z and 370.1 m/z) and to 40 V
(for 332.1 m/z and 348.2 m/z), respectively and the argon
collision gas was maintained at a pressure of 1.3· 10-6 bar.
Product ion spectra were recorded with a scan time of 0.5
s for each mass, a peak width of 0.7 for Q1 and Q3 and
within a range of m/z 40 to m/z of the moleclular ion + 10
mass units.
Mass spectrometric fragmentation behaviour of reference 
compounds
For each reference compound (Fig. 10), a solution with an
approximate concentration of 0.1 mg/ml was prepared by
dissolving the dry substances in methanol. Ten µl of these
standard solutions were injected separately and analysed
by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS under the same conditions as
the Chelidonium majus extract and Ukrain. The data were
then evaluated with respect to ionisation efficiency, com-
pound stability in the electrospray source and adduct for-
mation.
Statistical analysis
Experiments were at least performed in triplicates. Data
were represented as means ± SD. Where appropriate, one-
way ANOVA test or paired t-test were performed using

Results
Ukrain induces apoptosis in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells
Earlier reports suggested an involvement of apoptosis in
the antineoplastic activity of Ukrain [9,10,12,13]. There-
fore, in a first set of experiments we analysed the sensitiv-
ity of Jurkat Vector and A3 cells to apoptosis induction by
Ukrain. Evaluation of nuclear morphology by fluores-
cence microscopy upon treatment with increasing drug-
concentrations revealed Ukrain-triggered morphological
alterations that are indicative for apoptotic cell death
including chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage and
fragmentation (Fig. 2a). In line with this observation,
Ukrain induced a concentration- (Fig. 2b, white bars) and
time-dependent (Fig. 2c, white bars) increase of apoptotic
rates in Jurkat Vector cells compared to the respective
untreated controls as determined by flow cytometry using
light scatter characteristics indicative for cellular shrink-
age. Interestingly, Ukrain also induced a concentration-
dependent breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane
potential (Fig. 2b, grey bars). Similar to the results regard-
ing cellular shrinkage, Ukrain-induced alterations of
mitochondrial function were observed within 6 h after
treatment with 10 µg/ml Ukrain (Fig. 2c, grey bars). More-
over, Ukrain-treatment triggered a time- and concentra-
tion-dependent activation of caspases as indicated by flow
cytometric detection of increased rates of CaspACE®-fluo-
rescence (Fig 2b+c, black bars). These data were corrobo-
rated by detection of cleavage of caspase-3 and -8 as well
as of the caspase-3 substrate PARP that was observed
within 12 h after treatment with 10 µg/ml Ukrain (Fig.
2d). To evaluate importance of caspase-activation in
Ukrain-triggered apoptosis, apoptosis rates were deter-
mined in the presence of the broad-spectrum caspase-
inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Inhibition of caspase-activation by
pre-incubation with zVAD-fmk resulted in a reduced
amount of Ukrain-induced apoptosis compared to cells
treated with Ukrain in the absence of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 3a).
In addition, to prove cytotoxic efficacy of Ukrain in the
Jurkat T-lymphoma cell model, the number of living and
dead cells was determined by Trypan Blue Exclusion. As
shown in Fig. 3b, Ukrain-treatment increased the percent-
age of dead cells in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner.BMC Cancer 2006, 6:14 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/14

Signalling pathways of Ukrain-induced apoptosis
Up to now our data indicated that Ukrain triggers activa-
tion of caspases and alteration of mitochondrial function.
To gain further insight into the molecular requirements
for Ukrain-induced apoptosis we subsequently analysed
the contribution of death receptor-dependent and mito-
chondrial apoptosis signalling events.
Since our results revealed activation of caspase-8 upon
Ukrain-treatment, the importance of the death receptor

pathway was analysed using Jurkat cells lacking caspase-8
or the adapter protein FADD, Jurkat cells expressing the
caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIP-L as well as the respective con-
trol cells (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) [38]. In addition, variant Jurkat
A3 cells resistant to CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(CD95/TRAIL-resistant Jurkat cells) were used (Fig. 5)
[36]. Lack of FADD and caspase-8 as well as expression of
cFLIP-L were verified by Western blot analysis (data not
shown). Resistance of CD95/TRAIL-resistant Jurkat cells
to death receptor-induced apoptosis was verified by fluo-
rescence microscopy upon stimulation with 10 ng/ml
TRAIL (Fig. 5).

and time-dependent manner to the same extent as in Jur-
kat A3 control cells (Fig. 4a right and left panel, respec-

pase-3 and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP was
observed in the FADD-deficient cells (Fig. 4b). Consistent
with these findings, cFLIP-L expressing Jurkat cells as well
as CD95/TRAIL resistant Jurkat cells that failed to undergo
apoptosis upon treatment with 10 ng/ml TRAIL were sen-
sitive to Ukrain-induced apoptosis to the same extent as
the control cells (Fig. 5).
These data reveal that lack of caspase-8 or FADD, two
essential components of the death receptor pathway,
expression of cFLIP-L or resistance to death receptor lig-
ands do not abrogate apoptosis upon Ukrain-treatment.
In addtion, Ukrain-treatment induced mitochondrial
alterations. Therefore, we subsequently tested the hypoth-
esis that similar to DNA-damaging anticancer drugs,

Ukrain may trigger apoptosis via the mitochondrial apop-
tosis signalling cascade. Mitochondrial death pathways
are characterized by early depolarisation of the mitochon-
drial membrane potential and activation of caspases
downstream of the mitochondria. These events are regu-
lated by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins [39].
In this context, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function as
guardians of mitochondrial integrity preventing mito-
chondrial damage and caspase-activation triggered by
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members e.g. Bax and Bak at
the level of the mitochondria [40].
To analyse the contribution of the mitochondrial death
pathway Ukrain-induced apoptosis was determined in
Jurkat cells overexpressing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or a
dominant negative caspase-9, three known antagonists of
the mitochondrial death pathway, as well as the respective
mock-transfected control cells (Jurkat Vector). Expression
of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and caspase-9 were controlled by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 6c and data not shown).
In our hands, overexpression of Bcl-2 only partially inhib-
ited apoptosis induction upon treatment with Ukrain as
determined by fluorescence microscopy upon Hoechst
33342 staining (Fig. 6a). Similar results were obtained in
cells overexpressing Bcl-xL (Fig. 7). Moreover, Bcl-2 almost
completely abrogated apoptosis induction upon treat-
ment with etoposide or ionizing radiation, two paradig-
matic stimuli of the mitochondrial death pathway.
Expression of a dominant negative caspase-9 mutant
inhibited Ukrain-induced apoptosis to a similar extent,
while apoptosis induction upon treatment with etoposide
or ionizing radiation was less affected (Fig. 6a).
In line with these findings, overexpression of Bcl-2
reduced Ukrain-induced mitochondrial damage while
expression of the dominant negative caspase-9 was less
effective, at least at increased drug concentrations (Fig.
6b). The moderate effects on apoptosis induction
observed by flow cytometric analysis were reflected by
determination of caspase-activation using Western blot

analysis that revealed reduction but not inhibition of cas-
pase-activation and PARP-cleavage in Jurkat Bcl-2 cells
compared to control cells (Fig. 6d). In this regard, the
small amount of PARP-cleavage observed in untreated Jur-
kat Vector and Jurkat Caspase-9 DN cells was attributed to
increased levels of spontaneous apoptosis in untreated
cells compared to untreated Bcl-2 control cells.
Since expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and the dominant nega-
tive caspase-9 reduced Ukrain-induced apoptosis pointing
to the contribution of mitochondrial signalling events we
subsequently analysed whether Ukrain-treatment would
affect pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. How-
ever, treatment with Ukrain did not alter expression levels
or integrity of the pro-apoptotic Bak, Bid or Bad (data not
shown).
Mass spectrometric analysis of Ukrain-components
The main component of Ukrain as pharmaceutical prepa-
ration has been suggested to consist of three chelidonine
moieties crosslinked with one thiothepa unit in the center
representing the "Ukrain molecule" [1-3]. The postulated
chemical structure of the "Ukrain-molecule" (NSC-
631570) is depicted in Fig. 1 indicating its cationic struc-
ture with an calculated isotopic pattern for
[C66H72N6O15PS]3+ as given in Fig. 8.
To check integrity of the "Ukrain-molecule", mass spectro-
metric analysis of this pharmaceutical preparation was
performed. Surprisingly, the extracted ion chromatogram
(EIC) for m/z 417.2 (Fig. 9) demonstrated that the
reported semisynthetic thiothepa derivative Ukrain was
completely absent in the pharmaceutical preparation
Ukrain. Moreover, no dimeric or monomeric condensa-
tion products of thiotepa with two or one chelidonine
molecules were found (data not shown).
Instead, mass spectrometric analysis of the pharmaceuti-
cal preparation Ukrain revealed five major components of
the preparation including the Chelidonium majus alkaloids
protopine (peak no 1, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11) chelidonine
(peak no 2, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11), allocryptopine (peak no
3a and no 3b, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11), sanguinarine (peak no
4a and 4b, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11) and chelerythrine (peak no
5a and 5b, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11). Identity of the alkaloids
was shown by the detection of molecules with identical
MS/MS-fragmentation pattern as the reference com-
pounds (Fig. 10).
In addition, the same alkaloid components were identi-
fied in commercially available extracts of Chelidonium
majus (see peaks no 1–5, Fig. 10 and Fig. 12).
Extracts of Chelidonium majus extracts have similar 
proapoptotic potency as Ukrain
Based on the finding that instead of the suggested trimeric
chelidonine thiophosphortriamide the pharmaceutical
preparation Ukrain contains a mixture of several known
Chelidonium majus L alkaloids we wondered whether
extracts of Chelidonium majus L. would also induce apop-
tosis in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. To this end, we quanti-
fied apoptosis induction in Jurkat Vector cells upon
treatment with a commercially available Chelidonium
majus L. extract. As expected, Chelidonium majus L. extracts
adjusted to 5 to 50 µM chelidonine (corresponding to
1.765 µg/ml and 17.65 µg/ml chelidonine, respectively)

Overexpression of BclxL reduces Ukrain induced apoptosis. Jurkat Vector cells and Jurkat cells overexpressing anti-

µg/ml Ukrain (right panel). Apoptosis was then measured by fluorescence microscopy upon Hoechst33342-staining. Data show 
means ± SD (n = 3). Paired t-test was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 for Windows 95, GraphPad Software, San 
Diego California USA, http://www.graphpad.com).

as major alkaloid compound induced massive apoptosis
in Jurkat Vector cells within 24 h in a concentration-
dependent manner as quantified by fluorescence micros-
copy upon staining with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 13a). While
a concentration of 1 µM was almost ineffective, 5 µM
extract yielded massive apoptosis. A further increase in the
alkaloid concentration led only to a slight increase in the
number of apoptotic cells compared to the values
obtained with 5 µM extract. The characteristic nuclear
morphology observed upon treatment with Chelidonium
majus L. extracts is depicted in Fig. 13b. Quantification of
cell shrinkage and of depolarisation of the mitochondrial
membrane potential gave similar results (Fig 13c white
and grey bars, respectively). Interestingly, in contrast to
Ukrain, treatment with Chelidonium majus L. extracts
induced only low levels of caspase-activation (Fig. 13c,
black bars).
Chelidonine is a potent apoptosis inducing component of 
Ukrain
Up to now our data indicated that the pharmaceutical
preparation Ukrain and Chelidonium majus extracts both
constitute mixtures of diverse Chelidonium majus L. alka-
loids and induce apoptosis of Jurkat T-lymphoma cells
with almost similar potency. Consequently, we next
aimed to define the apoptosis inducing alkaloids among
the components of the Ukrain-preparation identified by
mass spectrometry.
To this end apoptosis induction by chelidonine, pro-
topine, allocryptopine, sanguinarine and chelerythrine
was analysed in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. In these investi-
gations chelidonine, sanguinarine and chelerythrine
turned out to be potent inducers of apoptosis in Jurkat
Vector cells inducing cell death in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner in the µM dose range (Figs. 14
and 15 as well as data not shown). Because of the known
proapoptotic effects of sanguinarine and chelerythrine,
only apoptosis inducing potency of chelidonine, pro-
topine and allocryptopine was analysed in more detail. In
these investigations chelidonine turned out to be a potent
inducer of apoptosis in Jurkat Vector cells inducing cell
death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 14a and data not shown). 1 µM chelidonine was suf-
ficient to induce apoptosis in Jurkat Vector and A3 cells
within 24 h as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 14a left
panel, white bars). Maximal effects were almost obtained
at a concentration of 5 µM and a further increase in the
chelidonine-concentration did not result in a further mas-
sive increase in apoptosis rates. Flow cytometric data
revealed strong chelidonine-induced mitochondrial dam-
age and caspase-activation in the same dose range (Fig.
14a left panel grey and black bars, respectively). Micro-
graphs showing typical apoptotic nuclear morphology of
Hoechst 33342-stained cells are depicted in Fig. 14a (right
panel) Interestingly, even at increased chelidonine con-
centrations, only moderate levels of necrotic cell death
(below 20%) were observed (data not shown).
The alkaloid protopine (≥ 50 µM) also exerted cytotoxic
effects on Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. However, increased
drug concentrations compared to chelidonine were
required to induce similar levels of cell death (approxi-
mately 40% of cell death upon treatment with 50 µM pro-
topine compared to 5 µM chelidonine) (Fig. 14b).
Interestingly, fluorescence microscopy of protopine-
treated cells upon combined staining with Hoechst 33342
and propidium iodide revealed that a further increase in
the alkaloid concentration led to increasing rates of
necrotic cell death (data not shown).
In contrast to the above mentioned findings the alkaloid
allocryptopine had only minor apoptosis inducing
potency. At concentrations between 50 and 150 µM the
drug almost completely failed to induce mitochondrial
damage, caspase-activation, chromatin condensation or
nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 15, left panel). Only at
increased drug concentrations (250 µM to 1 mM) alloc-
ryptopine induced cell death including apoptosis and
necrosis (Fig. 15, right panel).
These data were further substantiated by determination of
cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP. In this regard,

of Jurkat Vector cells with chelidonine, protopine, alloc-
ryptopine and Chelidonium majus L. extract revealed strong
caspase-activation indicated by massive PARP-cleavage
only upon treatment with 1 µM chelidonine, 50 µM pro-
topine and 5 µM Chelidonium majus L. extract, respectively,
while in the dose range tested, allocryptopine failed to
induce PARP-cleavage (Fig. 16).
Influence of Bcl-2 on chelidonine-induced apoptosis
Upon definition of chelidonine as a potent apoptosis
inducing component of Ukrain and Chelidonium majus L.
extracts, we wondered whether Bcl-2 would also interfere
with apoptosis regulation of this isolated alkaloid compo-
nent. As expected, Bcl-2 clearly reduced chelidonine-
induced mitochondrial damage, caspase-activation and
apoptosis at all concentrations tested, arguing for an
involvement of Bcl-2 in the regulation of chelidonine-
induced apoptosis (Fig. 17a–d).
Discussion
Our data clearly show that the antineoplastic drug prepa-
ration Ukrain (NSC-631570) is a potent inducer of apop-
tosis and cell death in human Jurkat T lymphoma cells
involving mitochondrial damage and caspase-activation.
However, our data also reveal that the cytotoxic efficacy of
Ukrain is not due to the suggested "Ukrain-molecule" but
instead to apoptosis inducing alkaloids from Chelidonium
majus L..
It has been shown earlier that Ukrain induces apoptosis in
tumour cell lines from human solid tumours
[9,10,12,13]. Here, we show for the first time that Ukrain

is also effective in a Jurkat T-Lymphoma cell model. Inter-
estingly, the concentrations required for efficient induc-
tion of apoptosis in Jurkat cells (1–50 µg/ml) were similar
to the concentration required for the reported radiosensi-
tizing effects of Ukrain on human colorectal and glioblas-
toma cell lines in vitro (0.1–50 µg/ml) [6].
However, up to now the mechanism of Ukrain-induced
apoptosis remained unclear. In our hands, apoptosis
induction did not require the presence of caspase-8 and
FADD, two integral signalling molecules of the death
receptor pathway. In line with these findings, expression
of the caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIP-L or resistance to the
death receptor ligands CD95 and TRAIL failed to abrogate
Ukrain-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate that
Ukrain induces apoptosis independently from death
receptor signalling. The delayed activation of caspase-3
and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP in the
FADD-deficient cells could be indicative for the contribu-
tion of a FADD-dependent signalling event.
In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and expression
of a dominant negative caspase-9 reduced Ukrain-induced
apoptosis revealing an involvement of the mitochondrial
signalling cascade that is controlled by anti-apoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 family. A similar protective effect of
Bcl-2 on Ukrain-induced apoptosis has also been reported
for human keratinocytes [41]. However, the moderate
inhibitory action of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and caspase-9 DN on
Ukrain-induced mitochondrial damage and caspase-acti-

vation suggests that some factors different from Bcl-2, Bcl-
xL and caspase-9 may be required for regulation of mito-
chondrial damage and apoptosis execution upon Ukrain-
treatment. In this regard, our data reveal that altered
expression levels or integrity of the proapoptotic Bcl-2
family members Bak, Bid or Bad were not involved in
Ukrain-induced apoptosis.
Our findings on the composition of the pharmaceutical
preparation implicate that several distinct alkaloid com-
pounds contribute to the proapoptotic signalling of
Ukrain. In this regard, mass spectrometric analyses of the
pharmaceutical preparation identified several well-known
alkaloids from Chelidonium majus L. including chelido-
nine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, protopine and allocryp-
topine as major constituents of the drug preparation
without evidence for the presence of the postulated
"Ukrain-molecule" or some dimeric or monomeric con-
densation products of thiotepa with two or one chelido-
nine moieties.
Interestingly, the same alkaloids were detected in a com-
mercially available Chelidonium majus L. extract. Of these,
chelerythrine, sanguinarine, chelidonine and to a lesser
extent protopine turned out to potently induce apoptosis
in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells, while allocryptopine was
almost ineffective. Together with the observation that
extracts from Chelidonium majus L. induced apoptosis of
Jurkat T-lymphoma cells in a similar dose range as the ref-
erence alkaloid chelidonine and Ukrain these findings
implicate that the pharmaceutical preparation Ukrain
may mainly constitute purified extracts from Chelidonium
majus L. and that the Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids cheli-
donine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine and protopine are
responsible for the reported cytotoxic effects of the drug
preparation. Our findings are consistent with a recent
publication from Panzer and co-workers that similarly
failed to confirm the presence of the specified "Ukrain-
molecule" by thin-layer chromatography, high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry and gave raise to the assumption that
Ukrain preparations may consist of a mixture of several
Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids [35].
Chelidonium majus L. and its alkaloids are well-known to
exert antitumour, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial
effects and to affect diverse cellular processes [42-47]. It
has been shown that chelerythrine, sanguinarine and che-
lidonine exert cytotstatic and cytotoxic effects on human
tumour cell lines [48-54]. In this context, the common
antimicrotubule properties of chelidonine, chelerythrine
and sanguinarine have been suggested to contribute to
their observed antineoplastic activity [49,55]. Moreover,

chelerythrine was found to function as an antagonist of
antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and to inhibit, similar to its structural
homologue sanguinarine, the anti-apoptotic mitogen-
activated protein kinase phosphatase as well as protein
kinase C [52,56-59].
Up to now only single reports revealed growth inhibitory
and pro-apoptotic effects of chelidonine [49,51]. In the
present investigation, we identified chelidonine as a
potent proapoptotic component of Ukrain and Chelido-
nium majus L. extract. Thus, in addition to chelerythrine

Apoptosis induction was analysed by fluorescence microscopy upon combined staining with Hoechst33342 and propidium 
iodide. The percentage of cells with characteristic apoptotic nuclear morphology was determined by counting a minimum of

shrinkage: white bars; breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential: grey bars; caspase-activation: black bars). Data show

and sanguinarine chelidonine may contribute to the
reported cytotoxic efficacy of both preparations. Interest-
ingly, while protopine, chelerythrine and sanguinarine
induced high levels apoptosis and necrosis, the predomi-
nant mode of cell death upon chelidonine-treatment was
apoptosis. This is consistent with recent data of Kemeny-
Beke and co-workers that observed similar effects in a pri-
mary human uveal melanoma cell line [51].
Moreover, we show for the first time that apoptosis induc-
tion by chelidonine involves alteration of mitochondrial
function and caspase-activation. The observation that
overexpression of Bcl-2 interfered with chelidonine-
induced apoptosis argues for a role of the intrinsic mito-
chondrial pathway. These data are reminiscent to recent
findings revealing the involvement of the mitochondrial
death pathway in sanguinarine-induced apoptosis in

immortalised keratinocytes [60]. However, Bcl-2 failed to
completely inhibit chelidonine-induced proapoptotic
effects pointing to the contribution of Bcl-2-independent
signalling events.
Our data implicate that defined proapoptotic alkaloid
compounds from Chelidonium majus L. may constitute
promising novel anticancer drugs [51]. In contrast,
despite numerous reports on beneficial effects of Ukrain
in preclinical investigations, case reports and non-rand-
omized as well as randomized clinical trials, up to now
there is no solid scientific basis for a rational use of Ukrain
in cancer treatment. In this regard, the suggested selective
antitumour activity of Ukrain is still controversial [7].
Moreover, a recent systematic review of published clinical
trial data revealed that most of the clinical data do not
meet stringent criteria for randomized clinical studies and
that methodological limitations of the remaining studies
(e.g. small sample size, poor or unknown method of ran-
domisation) actually prevent final conclusions on the
putative value of Ukrain for the treatment of cancer
patients [8]. Our finding that Ukrain represents a mixture
of Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids instead of the "Ukrain-
molecule" further challenges clinical use of Ukrain and in
addition rises concerns on potential adverse side effects of

Allocryptopine fails to induce apoptosis at concentrations below 250 µM. Allocryptopine-induced apoptosis was 
quantified by flow cytometric analysis using light scatter characteristics (white bars), measurement of mitochondrial membrane 
potential ∆ψm (grey bars) and the activation of caspase-3 (black bars) upon treatment of Jurkat Vector cells for 24 h with 
medium or 0, 50, 100, 150 and 250 µM allocryptopine. Data show means ± SD (n ≥ 3) (left panel). Fluorescence microscopy 
upon combined staining with Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide staining of cells treated with 250 µM allocryptopine for 24 h 
showed increased numbers of cells with apoptotic morphology upon treatment (right panel).

donium majus L. extracts [61,62].
Conclusion
Taken together, our investigation clearly shows that
induction of apoptosis contributes to the cytotoxic effects
of the pharmaceutical preparation Ukrain. Ukrain
induced apoptosis independently from death receptor sig-
nalling via a pathway involving mitochondrial damage
and caspase-activation that were partially sensitive to
overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and a dominant negative
caspase-9.
Importantly, our mass spectrometric data reveal that
instead of the composition indicated by the manufacturer
the pharmaceutical preparation Ukrain constitutes a mix-
ture of Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids including chelido-
nine, protopine, allocryptopine, chelerythrine and
sanguinarine. In addition to native Chelidonium majus L.
extract the isolated alkaloids sanguinarine, chelerythrine
and chelidonine were identified as potent inducers of
apoptosis in Jurkat T-Lymphoma cells that induced cell
death with similar potency as Ukrain. Consequently, our
data strongly suggest that the observed antineoplastic
effects of Ukrain are based on proapoptotic Chelidonium
Chelidonine-induced apoptosis is partially inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Figure 17
Chelidonine-induced apoptosis is partially inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/b>: Jurkat Vector and Bcl-2 overexpressing cells 
were treated for 24 h with medium supplemented with solvent or 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 µM chelidonine. Apoptosis induction 
was then quantified using (a) light scatter characteristics to determine cellular shrinkage, (b) TMRE-staining to detect altera-
tions of mitochondrial membrane potential ∆ψm, and (c) CaspACE®-staining to test caspase-activation. Data show means ± 
SD (n = 3). Paired t-test was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 for Windows 95, GraphPad Software, San Diego 
California USA, http://www.graphpad.com. (d) Combined staining with Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide of Jurkat Vector 
cells treated for 24 h with medium or 100 µM chelidonine revealed massive apoptosis while apoptosis rates were reduced in 
Bcl-2 overexpressing Jurkat cells.
