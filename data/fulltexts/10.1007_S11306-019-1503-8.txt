Abstract
Introduction To date, most studies of natural variation and metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in tomato have focused 
on fruit metabolism, leaving aside the identification of genomic regions involved in the regulation of leaf metabolism.
Objective This study was conducted to identify leaf mQTL in tomato and to assess the association of leaf metabolites and 
physiological traits with the metabolite levels from other tissues.
Methods The analysis of components of leaf metabolism was performed by phenotypying 76 tomato ILs with chromosome 
segments of the wild species Solanum pennellii in the genetic background of a cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) variety 
M82. The plants were cultivated in two different environments in independent years and samples were harvested from mature 
leaves of non-flowering plants at the middle of the light period. The non-targeted metabolite profiling was obtained by gas 
chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). With the data set obtained in this study and already pub-
lished metabolomics data from seed and fruit, we performed QTL mapping, heritability and correlation analyses.
Results Changes in metabolite contents were evident in the ILs that are potentially important with respect to stress responses 
and plant physiology. By analyzing the obtained data, we identified 42 positive and 76 negative mQTL involved in carbon 
and nitrogen metabolism.
Conclusions Overall, these findings allowed the identification of S. lycopersicum genome regions involved in the regulation 
of leaf primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism, as well as the association of leaf metabolites with metabolites from seeds 
and fruits.

1 Introduction
Integrated approaches combining genomics, transcriptom-
ics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics have been 
pivotal for metabolic network reconstruction and complex 
trait mapping (Saito and Matsuda 2010; Tohge et al. 2015). 
Moreover, several studies suggest that metabolite levels are 
heritable and might be controlled by multiple genes (Schauer 
et al. 2008; Chan et al. 2010; Alseekh et al. 2015; Wen et al. 
2015) and can therefore be considered as quantitative traits 
regulated by metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL). Some 
groups have reported genome wide association studies in 
tomato fruits (Sauvage et al. 2014; Tieman et al. 2017) or on 
leaf metabolism for a range of wild species (Schauer et al.

2005b; Matsuba et al. 2013; Ning et al. 2015; López et al. 
2015). To date, most mQTL research has been carried out by 
investigating introgression lines (ILs) or recombinant inbred 
lines (Schauer et al. 2006, 2008; Zanor et al. 2009; Do et al. 
2010).
In tomato, researchers have extensively used a popula-
tion of ILs of the wild species S. pennellii in the genetic 
background of the cultivated variety M82 of S. lycopersicum 
(Eshed and Zamir 1995). In this population, marker-defined 
genomic regions of S. lycopersicum were replaced by single 
homologous intervals of the S. pennellii comprising a core 
set of 76 lines. This population has been extensively pheno-
typed and allowed the identification of multiple QTL related 
to different traits. For example, some of the identified QTL 
were linked to fruit primary metabolite composition (Causse 
et al. 2004; Baxter et al. 2005; Schauer et al. 2006), fruit 
color (Liu et al. 2003) and enzymatic activity (Steinhauser 
et al. 2011). Others were associated with volatile metabolites 
and antioxidants (Baxter et al. 2005; Tieman et al. 2006; 
Quadrana et al. 2014), organ morphology (Holtan and Hake 
2003; Chitwood et al. 2013a; Ron et al. 2013), tolerance to 
abiotic and biotic stress (Lippman et al. 2007). Other QTL 
of ILs were associated to leaf water-use efficiency (Xu et al. 
2008) stomatal responsiveness, and stomatal-related anatom-
ical traits (Fanourakis et al. 2015), seed composition (Toubi-
ana et al. 2012, 2015) and secondary metabolite abundance 
(Alseekh et al. 2015; Schilmiller et al. 2015).
Recently we used the S. pennellii ILs to characterize 
photosynthetic and respiratory parameters, including  CO2 
assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll a fluo-
rescence parameters, growth traits and the main leaf primary 
metabolites (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). The findings of 
that study revealed a wide natural variation in plant growth, 
photosynthetic and essential metabolites (related to carbon 
and nitrogen metabolism) among tomato ILs. In total, over 
3069 QTL have been identified in this population to date 
(reviewed in Alseekh et al. 2013) and a handful of these 
QTL have been cloned (Pnueli et al. 1998; Ronen et al. 
2000; Fridman et al. 2004; Quadrana et al. 2014). The recent 
genome sequencing of the parental lines of this population 
(Bolger et al. 2014) should facilitate this labour-intensive 
process.
The combination of mQTL analysis with genomic tech-
nologies (Ingvarsson and Street 2011) allows researchers 
to provide lists of candidate regulatory genes of the meta-
bolic variations as well as of their effects on physiological 
parameters and interactions (Keurentjes et al. 2006). This 
approach, therefore, could widen the understanding of the 
genetic regulatory networks that might influence plant per-
formance and yield (Jansen et al. 2009; Hall et al. 2010).
In the present study, we analyzed the metabolite contents 
of mature leaves from non-flowering tomato plants harvested 
at the middle of light period. The analysis was performed in 
two consecutive harvests of the S. pennellii ILs. We contrast 
the results herein obtained to those previously reported for 
fruit and seed metabolites in the same population and with 
our recent analysis on the physiological properties of photo-
synthesis and respiration, also within this same population.
2  Materials and methods
2.1  Plant materials and experimental conditions
Seeds from 76 S. pennellii ILs (Eshed and Zamir 1995; Liu 
and Zamir 1999) and S. lycopersicum M82, kindly provided 
by Professor Dr. Dani Zamir (Hebrew University, Rehovot, 
Israel), were used in this study. In this IL population, unique 
overlapping genomic regions between introgressions delimi-
tate shorter intervals than the ones defined by the ILs, named 
“Bins” (Chitwood et al. 2013a, b). In total, 112 Bins have 
been defined by the complete set of ILs and most of the Bins 
harbor fewer than 500 annotated genes, with an average of 
295 genes in each region (Chitwood et al. 2013a, b).
The seeds were germinated on MS medium (Murashige 
and Skoog 1962) containing 2% (w/v) sucrose and were 
grown in a growth chamber (250 µmol photons m−2 s−1, 
22 °C) under a photoperiod of 16 h-light/8 h dark before 
transfer into the greenhouse. Once rooted, plantlets were 
acclimatized and subsequently transferred to 1.16 L pots 
with potting soil as previously described (Mirnezhad et al. 
2010). High variability for metabolite data is generally 
observed because of changes in environmental conditions 
(Schauer et al. 2006, 2008; Harrigan et al. 2007; de Oliveira 
Silva et al. 2018). For this reason, to access the contribu-
tion of environment, we repeated the experiment and analy-
sis in two independent experiments, in two locations and 
selected the ILs with conserved changes (de Oliveira Silva 
et al. 2017). In the first year of experiment, four plants for 
each line were grown in a randomized fashion in a glass 
house at the Plant Ecology Department, Institute of Biol-
ogy, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands. In the second 
year, four replicates for each line were also grown in a ran-
domized fashion in a glass house at the Instituto de Bio-
tecnologia, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologıa Agropecuaria 
(IB-INTA), in Castelar, Argentina. In both experiments, the 
plants were grown in the spring season under greenhouse 
conditions with a 16 h/8 h photoperiod, at 24 ± 5 °C, with 
60% humidity and 140 ± 40 µmol photons m−2 s−1 incident 
photo-irradiance. Tomato source leaves were sampled from 
the second or third leaflets of the third fully expanded leaf 
of 4 week-old non-flowering plants.

2.2  Determination of metabolite levels
Leaf samples were harvested at the middle of the light 
period, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 
− 80 °C until further analysis, as recommended by Fernie 
et al. (2011). Relative metabolite contents were determined 
using an established gas chromatography time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-based protocol. This 
protocol allows the quantification of sugars, sugar alco-
hols, organic and amino acids from the methanol extracts 
(Roessner-Tunali et al. 2003; Lisec et al. 2006). Chromato-
grams and mass spectra were evaluated by Chroma TOF® 
4.2 (Leco, St Joseph, MI) and TagFinder 4.0 (Luedemann 
et al. 2012). Analytes were manually identified using Tag-
Finder by comparing the results with the reference library 
mass spectra and retention indices in the Golm Metabo-
lome Database (Kopka et al. 2005). These procedures have 
been previously optimized for tomato (Roessner-Tunali 
et al. 2003). Mass-spectral libraries (Schauer et al. 2005a; 
Kopka et al. 2005) were used for peak identification. The 
use of these libraries allowed us to detect up to 78 metabo-
lites (Supplementary Table 1), a slightly larger number 
of metabolites than in our previous study (Schauer and 
Fernie 2006).
2.3  Heat maps
Heat maps were generated by using the heatmap function 
of the statistical software environment R, version 1.9. False 
color imaging was performed on the log2-transformed 
metabolite data using x-fold changes to cultivated variety 
M82.
2.4  QTL mapping and heritability
This procedure was carried out as previously described 
(Schauer et  al. 2008). The broad-sense heritability 
 (H2) was estimated by mixed effect models, with ran-
dom effects for genotype (number of ILs), environment 
(years 2001 and 2004) and genotype-environment inter-
action. We used the lmer function from the lme4 pack-
age in the R environment. The genetic variation coef-

 r and mc correspond to repeti-
tions number and average of each metabolite, respectively 
were obtained for each of the analyzed metabolite with the 
Genes program (Cruz 2013).
For QTL mapping, each IL was compared by t-test 
with M82 for each harvest. If an IL was significantly dif-
ferent from the reference genotype M82 (5% level) in both 
experiments and in the same direction, the effect was con-
sidered as harboring a QTL.
2.5  Network analysis
2.5.1  Pre‑processing metabolite data
The metabolite data sets were preprocessed following dif-
ferent steps. First, (i) the lines have been filtered out for 
which none of the metabolites were detectable. Also (ii) if 
the concentration of a specific metabolite was unavailable 
for more than half of the lines, the metabolite was filtered 
out. Finally, (iii) the rest of the missing values were imputed 
using random forest imputation (from randomForest pack-
age in R (Liaw and Wiener 2002)). To be robust with the 
estimation of missing values, we repeated the imputation 10 
times and used the average values to impute the NA values.
2.5.2  Metabolite relevance network
The metabolite relevance networks were separately inferred 
for each tissue (leaf, seed and fruit) in each and between 
the two seasons. To infer the networks, we applied pairwise 
Pearson correlation with the coefficients at a significance 
level of 0.01 (FDR corrected) to appear as a link in the net-
work. The list of links for each network is presented in Sup-
plementary Table 2.
2.5.3  Morphological trait‑metabolite association network
The same preprocessing procedure as for metabolites data 
was applied on phenotypic trait data. The missing values 
were imputed similarly. The relationships between all 
measured metabolites in leaf and the phenotypic traits were 
obtained by employing elastic net regression (cv.enet from 
elasticnet package in R (Zou and Hastie 2012). The profiles 
of the same metabolites from leaf in both seasons were con-
catenated and considered as predictors (regressors). Regres-
sion models were fitted for each phenotypic trait by com-
bining the corresponding profiles from both seasons. The 
regression coefficients were robustly estimated by 10-fold 
cross validation based on the optimum value for the penalty 
parameter from the set (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 10, 
100). The r-squared, which measures how well the data fitted 
to the regression model, was calculated for each model and 
represented in the network with the size of the correspond-
ing node (the bigger the size of the node, the better fitted the 
model to the data). The list of the links in the morphological 
trait-metabolite association network is represented in Sup-
plementary Table 3.

3  Results
3.1  Evaluation of leaf mQTL in the S. pennellii ILs
To assess the natural variation in leaf primary metabo-
lism, we employed an established GC-TOF-MS based 
metabolite profiling platform (Lisec et al. 2006) to the S. 
pennellii ILs (Eshed and Zamir 1995). Although this strat-
egy has already been applied to field grown fruit material 
(Schauer et al. 2006) and seeds derived thereof (Toubiana 
et al. 2012), it has not yet been applied to leaf material. 
This was in part because leaves of field grown plants were 
considered too heterogeneous to provide reliable material. 
This is the reason why we decided to evaluate greenhouse 
grown material here.
In total, we identified 45 and 78 metabolites in Experi-
ments 1 and 2, respectively. The complete datasets are pro-
vided in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5. The two data sets 
evidenced a large variability between the 2 experiments for 
all analysed metabolite classes (Supplementary Table 6). 
Surprisingly, the total number of significant changes was 
substantially higher in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 
2 (995 and 338 respectively). By counting the number of 
the ILs that exhibited the same alteration in both experi-
ments, we verified that the highest percentage of ILs with 
stable changes in amino acids levels occurred for threonine, 
asparagine and glutamate (10.8, 9.8 and 8.6%, respectively). 
The highest percentage of ILs with conserved changes for 
organic acids was for 2-oxoglutarate and succinate (17.0 and 
13.5% respectively), whereas for sugars was for glucose and 
maltose (9.4 and 4.8%, respectively). Regarding the changes 
in the content of metabolites from other classes, phosphoric 
acid, 3-caffeoyl-quinic acid (cis), glycerol and trehalose 
were the compounds with most conserved changes between 
the two locations (20.7, 15.4, 13.6 and 10.2% respectively). 
These results indicate a strong environmental component, 
probably due to substrate composition and other seasonal 
related effects, for the analysed metabolites in leaves and 
suggest that most changes in metabolite levels were adaptive 
and not constitutive.
To test how genetic variation may influence metabolite 
variation in this IL population, we estimated the genotypic 
coefficient of variation (Cvg) per metabolite (Supplemen-
tary table 7). The average Cvg of all metabolite traits in 
both experiments was 77.6 and 73.2% in Experiment 1and 2, 
respectively. By corollary, the coefficients of environmental 
variation (Cve) for Experiment 1 and 2 were therefore 22.4 
and 26.8% for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, even 
though we attempted to keep non-experimental variables 
constant, environmental differences were apparent. These 
environmental variables, however, were considerably less 
variable quantitatively than the genotype-derived variance.
We next assessed the heritability  (H2) of each metabo-
lite trait (Fig. 1). The measured traits exhibited mean  H2 
between 0.13 and 0.75 – corresponding to amino acids pro-
line and tyrosine, respectively. Of the measured sugars, an 
unknown-sugar and rhamnose displayed moderate to high 
 H2 values of 0.51 and 0.58, respectively. The metabolites 
2-oxoglutarate (0.67) and asparagine (0.64) showed high  H2 
values, whereas malate, fumarate and succinate displayed 
moderate  H2 with values of 0.51, 0.49 and 0.49, respectively. 
Taken together, these analyses suggest that the genetic vari-
ation is a major component controlling the metabolites from 
tomato leaves and that leaf metabolite abundances are mod-
erately heritable in this species.

3.2  Identification of mQTL
Using GC-TOF-MS, we were able to quantify 42 and 76 
metabolites, including a minimum of 15 amino acids, 10 
sugars, seven organic acids and 13 miscellaneous com-
pounds, in the leaves of S. pennellii ILs from two successive 
experiments. The full data sets are presented in an overlay 
heat map from samples harvested in the Experiment 1 and 2 
(Fig. 2). The data sets were superimposed on one another in 
an additive manner. In this way, consistently large increases, 
with respect to the S. lycopersicum content, are displayed in 
a deep red color, whereas consistently large decreases are 
shown in a deep blue color. Finally, those that increase in 
one year and decrease in the other are displayed in a purple 
color (for details see Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2 and Sup-
plemental Tables 3 and 4).
The relative differences in the content of any given 
metabolite range between 0 (below the levels of detection) 
and a 332-fold increase compared with the recurrent parental 
cultivar M82. The evaluation of the entire data set indicated 
that the amino acids glycine and proline exhibited the great-
est differences followed by fumarate and trans-caffeic acid, 
whereas threonine, asparagine and saccharic acid exhibited 
the lowest levels in comparison to the parental cultivar M82.
3.3  Genome location of the identified mQTL
We next used the data for mapping mQTL using ANOVA 
tests at a significance threshold of 0.05 to statistically com-
pare each IL with the control M82. Only a subset of the ILs 
displayed significant differences in metabolite content from 
the control M82 in both years of experiments. The follow-
ing analyses were focused on these mQTL. By using this 
criterion, we identified 118 mQTLs that were conserved in 
both experiments (Fig. 3; Supplemental Fig. 3). We then cal-
culated the total number of genes within each identified QTL 
as previously described (Chitwood et al. 2013a, b) (Supple-
mentary table 8) and found that the identified mQTL ranged 
from 98 to 2185 genes.
The evaluation of these data, regarding compound 
classes, indicated that 32 mQTL were for amino acids, 23 for 
sugars 27 for organic acids and 35 for other metabolites. In 
addition, the evaluation of the distribution of mQTL across 
the genome (Fig. 3) indicated that the conserved mQTL are 
unevenly distributed across the tomato genome, with fewer 
mQTL on chromosome 1 and 6 (2 mQTL for each chromo-
some). The highest number of mQTL were on chromosome 
8 (23 mQTL) as well as on chromosome 2 and 9 (13 mQTL 
each).
Although most of leaf mQTL reported here were 
unknown, some mQTL have been identified previously for 
tomato fruits (Schauer et al. 2006, 2008) or seeds (Toubiana 
et al. 2012, 2015) (Supplementary Table 9). For example, 
the IL2-5 and IL4-3 exhibited lower levels of threonine in 
leaves, fruits and seeds, whereas the IL5-2 and IL12-3 had 
lowered content of GABA in leaves and exhibited higher 
contents of the same metabolite in fruits. Interestingly, 19 
ILs displayed lower levels of phosphate in leaves, although 5 
of these ILs had higher phosphate content in seeds or fruits.
3.4  Morphological trait‑metabolite association 
network
Here we used the morphological traits measured on the 
leaves of the ILs of our recent work (de Oliveira Silva et al. 
2018) to conduct leaf morphological trait-metabolite asso-
ciations. The regression models have been fitted for each 
phenotypic trait by combining the corresponding profiles 
from both seasons (see materials and methods for detail). 
Figure 4 shows the network associations analysis between 
the 27 physiological/morphological traits (de Oliveira Silva 
et al. 2018) and metabolite measured by GC-TOF-MS in this 
study. The links in the morphological trait-metabolite asso-
ciation network are presented in the Supplementary table 3.
The results revealed a strong correlation between intercel-
lular  CO2  (Ci), electron transport rate (ETR), chlorophylls 
and dark respiration  (Rd) and several metabolites (Fig. 4). 
Among those, the sugars sucrose, psicose-like sugar, fruc-
tose and myo-inositol are the metabolites most linked to  Ci. 
A similar trend is evident between the ETR and metabolites 
glucose, GABA and myo-inositol.
We next assessed the correlation between the metabo-
lite levels in leaves (this study), fruit (Schauer et al. 2006) 
and seed (Toubiana et al. 2012) (Fig. 5; Supplementary 
Table 2). Interestingly, the most highly correlated parameters 
are those within the same tissue i.e. leaf–leaf, fruit–fruit 
and seed–seed parameters. However, there was relatively 
little correlation between the actual levels of metabolites 
between tissues. For examples, galactinol and 2-oxoglutar-
ate are the most highly correlated between leaf and fruit 
(0.82–0.98, p < 0.05) such as amino acids (e.g tyrosine, 
alanine, homoserine, asparagine, isoleucine, valine, serine, 
methionine, threonine), organic acid; fumarate and glycer-
ate, and others like calysteg A3 and squalene, also the 2-oxo-
glutarate showed the highest number of correlation between 
the leaf and seeds data mainly with β-alanine, asparagine, 
GABA, arginine, lysine and galacturonate.
4  Discussion and conclusion
Great effort has gone into characterizing the tomato fruit 
metabolome, with a focus on spatio-temporal changes 
in metabolism (Carrari et al. 2006; Mounet et al. 2009; 
Osorio et al. 2002) as well as on primary and second-
ary metabolism following both classical quantitative

trait loci approaches (Schauer et al. 2006; Tieman et al. 
2006; Do et al. 2010; Alseekh et al. 2015; Ballester et al. 
2016; Garbowicz et al. 2018). More recently, some groups 
have reported genome wide association studies (Sauvage 
et al. 2014; Tieman et al. 2017; Ye et al. 2017) and oth-
ers have assessed the effects of domestication and crop

ent studies of the leaf metabolite content of the ILs compared with 
the parental M82. Data represent measurements of leaf material har-
vested from two independent experiments presented as a heat map. 
Large sections of the map are white or pale in color and reflect that 
many of the chromosomal segment substitutions do not have an effect 
on the amount of every metabolite. Regions of red or blue indicate 
increased or decreased metabolite content, respectively, after intro-
gression of Solanum pennellii segments. Very dark coloring indicates 
that a large change in metabolite content was conserved across both 
harvests, whereas purple indicates an inconsistent change in that IL 
relative to M82. For each harvest, GC-TOF-MS was used to quantify 
primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, sugars and 
other metabolites. The ILs are presented in chromosomal order from 
top of chromosome 1 to base of chromosome 12 from top to bottom. 
A total of 76 ILs and 42 metabolites overlapped in both experiments

improvement on the metabolome. For instance, the selec-
tion for alleles of genes associated with larger fruits 
altered metabolite profiles as a consequence of linkage 
with nearby genes. In addition, the selection of 5 major 
loci reduced the accumulation of anti-nutritional steroidal 
glycoalkaloids in ripened fruits, thus rendering the fruit 
more edible. On the other hand, breeding for pink toma-
toes modified the content of over 100 metabolites. That 
said, with the exception of exquisite work carried out dis-
secting acyl sugar metabolism in trichromes (specialized 
secretory cell types found in leaves; see for example (Fan 
et al. 2017)), relatively little work has been performed on 
the characterization of leaf metabolism of the S. lycoper-
sicum complex (Schauer et al. 2005b; de Oliveira Silva 
et al. 2018).
With this in mind, we used GC-TOF-MS to evaluate the 
levels of primary metabolites in the well-studied S. pennellii 
ILs (Eshed and Zamir 1995; Alseekh et al. 2013) grown in 
two independent greenhouse trials.
Despite the relative high broad sense heritability of most 
metabolites, with most values being of similar magnitude 
to those published previously for fruits (Schauer et  al. 
2006), far fewer QTL were identified for the leaves (117) 
than for the fruit (889). Intriguingly, this occurs even when 
the maximal variance in compound abundance is far greater 
for leaf samples described here than for either the fruit or 
seeds (Toubiana et al. 2012) of this population. There are 
several possible explanations for the reduced identification 
of QTL. Leaf metabolite content may be more influenced 
by the environment because it is more closely related to 
photosynthesis than the fruit, which largely relies on leaf 
assimilate supply, even though it can, at least during early 
stages of fruit development, produce its own photoassimilate 
(Lytovchenko et al. 2011). Another possible explanation is 
that when we analyzed gene expression datasets (Chitwood 
et al. 2013b), they were far considerably less changed in 
the leaves – a fact that is true both of all genes and only 
those genes associated with metabolism (Supplementary 
Fig. 4  Morphological trait-
metabolite association network 
obtained for leaf. The red and 
blue links imply positive and 
negative correlation coefficients, 
respectively. The color of the 
nodes represents the metabolite 
classes. The “diamond” shape in 
the nodes stands for phenotypic 
and metabolite traits (from: 
de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018), 
whereas the “circle” shape 
corresponds to the metabolites 
in leaf. The r-square, which 
measures how well the data fit-
ted to the regression model, was 
calculated for each model (phe-
notypic trait) and represented in 
the network with the size of the 
corresponding node. The bigger 
the size of the diamond, the bet-
ter the model fitted to the data

Fig. 4). Whatever the explanation, the lower QTL number 
in leaves indicates that leaf metabolite levels are likely under 
far greater environmental, and probably also genetic, influ-
ence than those of the fruit or seed. The degree of canaliza-
tion of metabolism may be far lower than that we recently 
reported in the fruit (Alseekh et al. 2017). Further harvests 
will need to be evaluated before we can formally test this 
hypothesis. However, the high influence of environment on 
the metabolome notwithstanding, a number of interesting 
novel QTL were detected here. At the genome level, the 118 
QTL were largely well-spread across the genome with the 
individual lines containing between 0 and 6 QTL. However, 
chromosome 2, 8 and 9 could be regarded as metabolite QTL 
hotspots similar to those previously reported in the genomes 
of Arabidopsis, rice and maize (Lisec et al. 2009; Wen 
et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). Interestingly, a previous survey 
of the S. lycopersicum complex revealed that the parental 
lines of the ILs displayed highly divergent primary metab-
olite abundances. In that survey, the amino acids alanine, 
β-alanine,  glutamine, glutamate, glycine, proline and serine 
were considerably higher in S. pennellii, whereas GABA and 
the branched chain amino acids were considerably higher in 
S. lycopersicum (Schauer et al. 2005b). On the other hand, 
the organic acids ascorbate and citrate were much higher and 
isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate much lower in S. pennellii than 
in S. lycopersicum and, finally, glucose was much higher 
but other sugars much lower in S. pennellii (Schauer et al. 
2005b). Whereas many of the directionalities of the QTL 
correspond to the differences between the parental lines, 
this is, by no means, always the case. For example, there 
are QTL for decreased glucose content and increased minor 
sugar contents, suggesting the presence of a considerable 
degree of transgressive behavior, as previously observed in 
the fruit (Schauer and Fernie 2006). Furthermore, here we 
identified mQTL that have been identified previously for 
seeds (Toubiana et al. 2012, 2015) and fruits (Schauer et al. 
2006, 2008) (Supplementary Table 8).
We were also interested in how the metabolite QTL were 
related to the 27 physiological and morphological pheno-
types we have previously collected on this population (de 
Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). Highly interesting correlations 
were evident and, because of the size of the population, are 
likely very robust. Amongst these are the strong correla-
tions between the sugars sucrose, fructose and myo-inositol 
with the intracellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci). In 
addition, glucose, GABA and myo-inositol were strongly 
correlated with the chloroplastic ETR. Similarly, sucrose, 
glucose and fructose as well as the amino acids threonine, 
alanine and aspartate were highly correlated with shoot 
dry weight. These correlations are all consistent with the 
role of leaves as a source tissue. Indeed, the links to Ci and 
the ETR likely reflects that high levels of the latter result 
in high photoassimilate production but the effects on dry 
weight to the shoots likely reflecting the fact that sugars are

available as substrates for polymer synthesis and respiration, 
respectively.
Perhaps equally interestingly, some of the correlations 
that we had anticipated were not detected here. For example 
considerable evidence links the abundance of both ascor-
bate and malate to various aspects of photosynthesis with 
transgenic tomato plants that accumulate different levels of 
these metabolites and show alterations in  CO2 assimilation 
rates and stomatal aperture (Nunes-Nesi et al. 2005; Araujo 
et al. 2011) and to studies in experimental vineyard; which 
suggests the generality of this relationship (Gago et al. 
2017). These relationships were not uncovered in our cur-
rent study. This may however merely reflect the relatively 
minor changes in the leaf levels of malate and ascorbate 
across the population.
Noteworthy, our study also demonstrated that a greater 
number of highly correlated parameters occur within the 
same tissue and not between tissues (Fig. 5). This result is 
at first glance surprising, particularly because in our pre-
vious study the harvest index (the ratio of agronomically 
useful yield over the total yield) exhibited a controlling role 
in fruit metabolite composition (Schauer et al. 2006; Phuc 
et al. 2010). It is important to mention that the plants were 
not at a similar developmental stage when seed/fruit and 
leaf tissues were harvested. This certainly added to the low 
number of correlations observed between metabolites from 
different organs but highlighted the leave metabolites that 
are highly associated with fruit and seed metabolites even 
in early stages of plant development. For example, succinate 
and 2-oxoglutarate in leaves of young plants are highly asso-
ciated with several metabolites in seeds (Fig. 5). Moreover, 
because fruit, seed and leaf exhibit distinct metabolic activ-
ity and have different degree of specialization, the observed 
results highlight the existing differences in metabolite com-
position between different plant tissues and organs, as previ-
ously described (Desbrosses et al. 2005; Matsuda et al. 2009, 
2010). These studies emphasize that plants synthesize hun-
dreds to thousands of compounds, of which some are accu-
mulating in specific and distinct tissues and organs, whereas 
others are more general and concentrate in several tissues. 
Thus, our results suggest that flexibility in the regulation of 
metabolism is certainly required for the dynamic control of 
metabolic activity among the tissues and organs.
In summary, here we have characterized the genetic 
architecture of primary metabolites within the tomato leaf, 
extending the data of the far more studied fruit and seed 
tissues. A whole plant understanding of metabolism will 
be required to optimize crop yield and quality in next gen-
eration crop engineering (Sonnewald and Fernie 2018). In 
agreement, similarly to other such cross tissue analyses per-
formed in maize (Wen et al. 2015), 10 of these QTL are 
conserved across the tissues, whereas many others are tissue 
specific. The availability of the genome sequences of both 
parental lines (Bolger et al. 2014) together with a higher 
resolution backcrossed inbred lines population of S. pennel-
lii likely represent important tools for the understanding of 
the individual metabolite QTL and their associations with 
physiological and morphological traits.
