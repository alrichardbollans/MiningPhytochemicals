Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the
ameliorative effects of a crude extract of Vaccaria segetalis
(Neck.) Garcke (Caryophyllaceae) (VSE) on osteopenia in
ovariectomized (OVX) rats over 12 weeks. Rats were
divided into the sham and OVX groups. The OVX rats
were allowed to lose bone for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks post-
OVX, the OVX rats were divided into four groups treated
with water, 17b-estradiol (30 lg/kg, daily subcutaneous
injection), or VSE (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg, daily, orally) for
6 weeks. In OVX rats, the increases of serum total cho-
lesterol were significantly decreased by VSE or 17b-
estradiol treatment. There were decreases in bone density
and calcium content, including the left femur and the fourth
lumbar vertebra, when compared with the sham control
rats. Treatment with 17b-estradiol or VSE ameliorated
these changes induced by OVX. In addition, ovariectomy
increased urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) amounts
(P \ 0.001). The increases were suppressed by 17b-estra-
diol and 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg VSE (P \ 0.01, P \ 0.05,
P \ 0.01, respectively). Our results demonstrated that VSE
ameliorates ovariectomy-induced osteopenia by inhibition
of bone resorption.

Introduction
The plant Vaccaria segetalis (Neck.) Garcke (Caryophylla-
ceae) is an annual herb widely distributed in Asia, Europe,
and other parts of the world. The seeds of this plant, called
Wang Bu Liu Xing in traditional Chinese medicine, have
been prescribed frequently to cure diseases in women after
childbirth owing to their capacity to activate blood flow and
promote milk secretion. Wang Bu Liu Xing is also used in the
treatment of amenorrhea and breast infections [1].
Previous studies have shown that the ethanol extract of
Vaccaria segetalis seeds contains many compounds
including triterpenoid saponins, glycosides, and cyclic
peptides [2–7]. Moreover, some of the isolated nonsteroidal
cyclic hexa-and pentapeptides (segetalin A, B, G, and H)
exhibit estrogen-like activity [2, 4].
In previous work, a methanol extract (MeOH Ext) and
ethyl acetate extract (AcOEt Ext) of Vaccaria segetalis
seeds and a cyclic peptide from the extracts were bioas-
sayed for their female sex hormone-like activities in rats.
When MeOH Ext, AcOEt Ext, and segetalis A and B were
administrated to rats for 14 consecutive days, the weight of
the uterus increased dose dependently [2]. However, that
study was restricted to the normal animal model for a short
period.
Nevertheless, studies in appropriate animal models will
provide additional insights into the physiological effects of
specific susceptibility. Ovariectomy-induced bone loss in

the rat and postmenopausal bone loss share many similar
characteristics, and similar skeletal response to therapy
with 17b-estradiol [8]. Standard dose estrogens reduce
bone turnover markers by 40–50%. Low dose oral estrogen
[9] or transdermal estradiol [10] suppress bone turnover by
about 25–30%, whereas ultralow estrogen dosage reduces
turnover by about 20% [9, 11]. These similarities are strong
evidence that the ovariectomized (OVX) rat bone loss
model is suitable for studying postmenopausal bone loss in
women [12].
Thus, the present study was designed to develop the
animal model that resembles disease course in order to
examine the ameliorating effect of VSE on bone loss due to
OVX. In order to probe one of the possible mechanisms of
VSE-induced amelioration of bone loss, we also examined
the effect of VSE on the levels of serum alkaline phos-
phatase and urinary deoxypyridinoline.
Materials and methods
Preparation of the plant extract
Dry seeds of Vaccaria segetalis (Neck.) Gracke (Caryo-
phyllaceae) were purchased from the local market in
August 2007. All materials were sorted and identified by
Associate Professor Chao-Lin Kuo and voucher specimens
(CMCP 1560) were deposited in the China Medical Uni-
versity, Taichung, Taiwan.
Fifty kilograms of ground Vaccaria segetalis was
soaked in 270 l methanol and extracted in a Waring blen-
der (four times), followed by a 2-h reflux. The methanol
extracts were filtered and concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40C to obtain a 1,912-g crude VSE extract in
approximately 3.6% yield. The extract was stored at
-20C until use. The extract was diluted and adjusted as
appropriate, then administered orally to rats at a dose of
0.5 g or 1.0 g/kg body weight, respectively. Control rats
were administered water in a similar way.
A sample of crude VSE extract was partitioned between
H2O, EtOAc, and n-butanol. The n-butanol-soluble material
was purified using a Diaion HP-20 column (H2O–MeOH).
The 80% MeOH-eluted fraction was chromatographed on
ODS-MPLC and finally ODS-HPLC to afford two isolated
peptides, segetalins G (0.001%) and H (0.002%), containing
basic amino acids such as Arg and Lys (Fig. 1).
Animals
Female Wistar rats were obtained from the National Labora-
tory Animal Breeding and Research Center, National Science
Council, and fed with laboratory diets (Fwu Sow Industry,
Taichung) and tap water ad libitum. The experimental animals
were housed in an air-conditioned room at 23 ± 2C with
12 h of light. At the beginning of the study, rats were 6 months
old with an average weight of 320 ± 6.8 g. The rats were
weighed every week during the experiments.
The rats were divided into five groups (n = 9): four
OVX groups and one sham-operated group. The OVX rats
were allowed to lose bone for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks post-
OVX, the OVX rats were subdivided into four groups that
received vehicle (water), 17b-estradiol (30 lg/kg, daily,
subcutaneous injection), or VSE (0.5 or 1 g/kg, daily,
orally) for 6 weeks, respectively. The sham-operated group
was treated orally with vehicle. 17b-Estradiol was dis-
solved in a small volume of absolute alcohol, and the
concentration was adjusted with sesame oil.
Surgery on animals was done under pentobarbital
sodium (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) anesthesia. Bilateral
ovariectomies were performed from a dorsal approach with
a small midline dorsal skin incision. Success of

ovariectomy was confirmed at necropsy by failure to detect
ovarian tissue and by observation of marked atrophy of
uterine horns. The sham-operated rats were subject to sham
surgery in which the ovaries were exposed but not
removed.
Sixteen-hour urine samples were collected at 6 and
12 weeks after OVX. Blood samples were also collected at
the same time. On the last day of the study, the animals
were sacrificed under ether anesthesia. The femora and
lumbar vertebra were dissected and stored in a freezer at
-80C until examinations. Several organs, including the
uterus, vagina, and thymus, were dissected out and
weighed immediately. All animals were treated humanely
and the study protocols were in compliance with our
institution’s guidelines for the use of laboratory animals.
Biochemistry
Serum alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, serum cal-
cium, and urinary calcium were determined on an auto-
matic analyzer (Ciba-corning 550, USA) using Beckman’s
kits.
Urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was assayed on an
automated chemiluminescence system using Chiron diag-
nostic ACS: 180. The values of DPD in urine samples were
expressed per millimole of urinary creatinine. Urinary
creatinine content was determined enzymatically with an
aliquot of each urine sample using a clinical chemistry
analyzer.
Bone density
The right femur and fourth lumbar vertebra were cleaned of
soft tissues. Bone volume and density were measured by
using Archimedes’ principle [12]. Briefly, each bone was
put in an unstoppered vial filled with deionized water, and
the vial was placed in a desiccator connected to a vacuum
for 90 min. The desiccator was agitated periodically to
ensure that all trapped air diffused out of the bone, at which
time the bone was removed from the vial, blotted with
gauze sponge, weighed, and returned to the vial containing
deionized water. The bone was reweighed in a boat sus-
pended, but completely immersed, in water previously
equilibrated to room temperature, and the density (in grams
per cubic centimeter of bone volume) was calculated.
Before the density was measured as outlined above, the
femur was cut at the mid-diaphysis and the marrow was
washed out.
Bone calcium content
After the bone marrow had been carefully removed, the
right femur and the fourth lumbar vertebra were desiccated
in different baths of alcohol, and dried overnight at 100C.
The dry weight was then determined. Femur and the fourth
lumbar vertebra were incinerated for 12 h at 1,000C, and
then the ash weight was determined. The samples were
pulverized and divided into suitable aliquots for analysis.
The bone calcium content was determined by atomic
absorptiometry (Z-8200; Hitachi, Ltd., Japan) using sam-
ples dissolved in a solution of 6 N HCl and 0.1 N HNO3
(1:9), diluted with HNO3, and containing 0.1% lanthanum
chloride solution to prevent interference. The values were
expressed as milligrams of calcium per cubic centimeter of
bone volume.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was calculated by one-way analysis
of variance coupled with the Dunnett’s test. The statisti-
cally significant differences between the body weight,
serum total cholesterol at 12 weeks post-OVX and 6 weeks
post-OVX were tested by a paired t test. P values less than
0.05 were taken as significant.
Results
Body weight
The five rat groups started with similar mean body weights.
At 6 weeks post-OVX, body weight gains in OVX rats
were significantly greater than in sham rats (?25.1%). At
12 weeks post-OVX, both the OVX control group and
OVX ? VSE 0.5 g/kg group, but not OVX ? 17b-estra-
diol and OVX ? VSE 1.0 g/kg groups, had gained sig-
nificantly more weight than at 6 weeks post-OVX
(Table 1).
Organ weights
The weights of uterus and vagina in OVX rats were sig-
nificantly decreased compared with sham rats (P \ 0.001,
P \ 0.001, respectively). The weights of uterus and vagina
were, respectively, as follows: 0.668 ± 0.137 and
0.269 ± 0.059 g for the sham group, 0.148 ± 0.011 g
(P \ 0.001) and 0.110 ± 0.050 g (P \ 0.001) for the
OVX control group. Administration of 17b-estradiol, but
not VSE, increased in the weight of the uterus and vagina
in OVX rats. The weights of uterus and vagina, respec-
tively, were as follows: 0.843 ± 0.065 g (P \ 0.001) and
0.240 ± 0.016 g (P \ 0.001) for the OVX ? 17b-estra-
diol group.
As shown in Table 2, there were no differences
regarding ovariectomy in terms of thymus weight. The
thymus weights of 17b-estradiol-treated rats were
388 J Nat Med (2009) 63:386–392
123
significantly decreased compared with the OVX control
rats (P \ 0.01) (Table 2).
Serum total cholesterol
At 6 weeks post-OVX, the levels of serum total cholesterol
in OVX rats were significantly greater than in sham rats
(?37.1%). At 12 weeks post-OVX, the OVX ? 17b-
estradiol rats and the OVX ? VSE 1.0 g/kg rats had sig-
nificantly lower total serum cholesterol levels compared
with the OVX control group (P \ 0.05) (Table 3).
Urinary DPD, urinary calcium, and serum calcium
Ovariectomy induced a rise in the content of urinary DPD
(?125.2%), and treatment with 17b-estradiol or 0.5 or
1.0 g/kg VSE lowered the content of urinary DPD com-
pared with OVX control group (P \ 0.01, P \ 0.05,
P \ 0.01, respectively) (Table 3). Ovariectomy and treat-
ment with 17b-estradiol or VSE had no effect on serum
calcium. The serum calcium content of the sham group was
2.5 ± 0.2 nmol/l. Ovariectomy caused a decrease of
urinary calcium and this was corrected by 17b-estradiol
treatment. There were no differences between the VSE-
treated group and OVX control group regarding the content
of urinary calcium (Table 3).
Serum alkaline phosphatase
At 12 weeks post-OVX, the levels of serum alkaline
phosphatase in OVX groups were significantly higher than
in the sham group (P \ 0.001). At 12 weeks post-OVX,
the OVX ? 17b-estradiol group, but not the OVX ? VSE
groups, had a significantly lower level of serum alkaline
phosphatase compared with the OVX group (Table 3).
Bone density and bone calcium content
There were significantly lower densities of the femur and
the fourth lumbar vertebra in the OVX group compared
with the sham group (P \ 0.001, P \ 0.001, respectively).
Administration of 17b-estradiol and 1.0 g/kg VSE caused a
significant increase of bone densities of the femur

compared with the OVX control group (P \ 0.01,
P \ 0.05, respectively). Administration of 17b-estradiol
and VSE caused a significant increase of bone densities of
the fourth lumbar vertebra compared with the OVX control
group (P \ 0.001, P \ 0.05, respectively) (Table 4).
Ovariectomy caused a significant decrease in calcium
content of the femur and fourth lumbar vertebra. Admin-
istration of 17b-estradiol and OVX ? VSE caused a sig-
nificant increase in calcium content of the femur and fourth
lumbar vertebra compared with the OVX control group
(Table 4).
Discussion
Our results demonstrated that VSE ameliorated bone loss,
but did not cause uterine hypertrophy in estrogen-deficient
OVX rats.
Our data on body weight and serum total cholesterol
supported observations from other investigators who
reported that both gained body weight and elevated serum
total cholesterol due to ovarian hormone deficiency are
prevented by estrogen administration [12, 13]. Our results
showed that VSE and 17b-estradiol treatment inhibited
OVX-induced gained body weight and elevated serum total
cholesterol.
According to previous evidence, rats in the OVX group
had lower bone density and calcium content of the femur
and the fourth lumbar vertebra, the loss of which was
completely prevented in animals receiving 17b-estradiol
[14–16]. In the present study, 17b-estradiol and VSE are
also effective in preventing bone loss in the femur and the
fourth lumbar vertebra.
Estrogen prevents bone loss due to ovarian hormone
deficiency by a mechanism that involves the suppression of
the rate of bone turnover that involves the depression of

both osteoclastic and osteoblastic bone formation [8].
Concentration of serum alkaline phosphatase, an index of
bone formation, was significantly greater in the OVX group
than in the sham-operated group [8, 17]. Administration of
VSE did not decrease serum alkaline phosphatase in the
OVX rats. Ovariectomy increased urinary DPD amounts
(DPD is a marker of bone resorption [18]). Both VSE and
17b-estradiol decreased urinary DPD amounts. The results
suggested that VSE ameliorated the bone loss due to OVX
by inhibition of bone resorption, but not stimulation of
bone formation.
Segetalins A and B exhibit estrogen-like activity and
both peptides contain a common sequence, Trp-Ala-Gly-
Val [2]. Previous study has shown that sequence homology
among segetalins A, B, and G is recognized in Tyr-Ala-
Gly-Val of segetalin G and in Trp-Ala-Gly-Val of segeta-
lins A and B [4]. Furthermore, the sequence of Phe-Ser-Gly
in segetalin H is partly similar to the above sequence in
segetalins A, B, and G. The sequence homology and
estrogen-like activity may be related each other [4].
According to the present results, we demonstrated that
V. segetalis extract and 17b-estradiol exerted ameliorative
effects on osteopenia in OVX rats. Since estrogen is
reported to prevent bone loss [8], it is likely that the
ameliorative effect of the former results from the content of
segetalins G and H, which have sequence homology and
exhibit estrogen-like activity; however, this hypothesis
requires further investigation.
In this study and others [17, 19], treatment with 17b-
estradiol completely corrected the decreased urinary cal-
cium excretion observed in OVX rats. Our results showed
that VSE has no effect on urinary calcium in OVX rats
compared with the OVX control and sham group.
Estrogen is the drug of choice for preventing loss of
bone in postmenopausal women [20]. However, estrogen
therapy in postmenopausal osteoporosis increases the risk
of endometrial cancer [16, 21]. Recently, a major research
effort has been targeted at finding a drug that has the
positive skeletal effects without the potentially negative
effects on reproductive tissue [16]. Raloxifene, one
example of a compound in this class, is a mixture of
estrogen antagonist and agonist. Raloxifene has been
shown to have the positive effects of estrogen on bone and
serum total cholesterol [20] without causing uterine
hypertrophy in OVX rats [22].
It is well known that estrogen increases the weight of the
uterus and vagina [23]. The extract of V. segatalis also has
reported estrogen-like activity and increased the weights of
uterus and vagina [2, 4]. The present data showed that
OVX decreased the weight of the uterus and vagina com-
pared with the sham group. Administration of VSE did not
cause uterine or vaginal hypertrophy and is effective in
preventing bone loss in OVX rats. Our study result is not
consistent with previous studies regarding uterus weight in
different animal models. Thus, experimental conditions
such as age, type, and metabolic status of the animal
model, as well as the level and duration of VSE treatment
may play an integral role in how VSE affects body com-
position. Our results indicated that VSE possessed estrogen
agonist/antagonist character in OVX rats, suggesting that
VSE may have a similar effect as raloxifene on bone loss
and uterus weight.
The findings of the present study indicate that VSE may be
useful for the treatment of osteoporosis. Further compre-
hensive chemical and pharmacological investigations will be
needed to elucidate the exact mechanism causing this effect.
