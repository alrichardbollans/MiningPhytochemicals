We examine the genetic architecture of diversereproductive fitness traits in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a crop (seed oil) × wild-like (rapidcycling) genotype of Brassica rapa in field and greenhouse environments.Results: Several fitness traits showed strong correlations and QTL-colocalization across environments (days tobolting, fruit length and seed color). Total fruit number was uncorrelated across environments and most QTLaffecting this trait were correspondingly environment-specific. Most fitness components were positively correlated,consistent with life-history theory that genotypic variation in resource acquisition masks tradeoffs. Finally, wedetected evidence of transgenerational pleiotropy, that is, maternal days to bolting was negatively correlated withdays to offspring germination. A QTL for this transgenerational correlation was mapped to a genomic regionharboring one copy of FLOWERING LOCUS C, a genetic locus known to affect both days to flowering as well asgermination phenotypes.Conclusions: This study characterizes the genetic structure of important fitness/yield traits within and betweengenerations in B. rapa. Several identified QTL are suitable candidates for fine-mapping for the improvement of yieldin crop Brassicas. Specifically, brFLC1, warrants further investigation as a potential regulator of phenology betweengenerations.Keywords: Fitness components, Life-history traits, Phenotypic plasticity, Transgenerational effects, Yield,Brassica rapaBackgroundFemale reproductive fitness is an important measure ofoverall crop yield for many cultivated species, such asgrain crops and oilseeds. In an evolutionary context, re-productive fitness is commonly used to estimate selec-tion, as in studies investigating crop allele persistence inwild populations [1-3]. Fitness and yield are determinedby complex interactions among traits expressed through-out plant development, such as flowering time [4,5], fruitshape [6], seed size [7,8] and seed number [9]. Recentquantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies in severalagricultural systems have suggested that QTL affectingfitness traits are often clustered in the genome, suggest-ing tight physical linkage or pleiotropic effects on severalcomponents of fitness [9-14], but the ubiquity of this re-sult across experimental populations and environmentsis not well understood.Elucidating the genetic architecture underlying fitnesstraits is critical to predicting their response to selection.For example, although it may be desirable to increaseboth seed size and seed number in oilseed cultivars, suchas Brassica rapa, selection for these traits may be con-strained if they are controlled by antagonistic pleiotropyof a single locus or by loci in repulsion phase and in suchclose physical proximity that recombination is limited. AQTL mapping study in Arabidopsis thaliana suggestedthat antagonistic pleiotropy of a gene region controllingboth seed mass and ovule number may lead to the trade-offs between these traits that have been observed in nu-merous cultivated and natural species [7]. If this regionrepresents structured pleiotropy, in that allelic substitu-tions at one locus affect both traits, they will be resistant* Correspondence: dechaine@cwu.edu1Department of Biological Sciences, Central Washington University,Ellensburg, WA 98926, USAFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2014 Dechaine et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66to change even under strong selection [15,16]. In this situ-ation, it may be prudent to search for natural populationsin which these associations are weaker or focus selectionefforts on loci that are not pleiotropically regulated.If covariances among desirable traits are primarily dueto extensive linkage disequilibrium, fine-mapping throughmarker-assisted selection could help to disrupt these asso-ciations [17]. QTL regions often encompass regions toolarge to conclusively discriminate between pleiotropy andlinkage, but they provide a starting point for fine-mappingand marker-assisted selection of specific loci [18,19].Recent studies have advanced from QTL screens to map-based cloning and association mapping to successfullyidentify candidate genes for important fitness traits in seedoil crops, such as Brassica species [6,20-23].It is also of interest to understand how QTL expressionfor fitness characters may vary across simulated versusfield/natural settings, as plant breeders attempt to extrapo-late to the field from controlled experiments. SignificantQTL × environment interactions have been detected forfitness traits in A. thaliana plants grown in the field versusgreenhouse or growth chamber environments, suggestingsignificant differences in QTL expression between con-trolled and natural settings [24-26]. On the other hand,strong genetic correlations and QTL colocalization be-tween the greenhouse and field have been observed fortraits with high heritabilities [26]. Extrapolating QTLdata from controlled to field environments may thus beappropriate for some traits.Seed germination is an important but frequentlyneglected component of plant fitness. Establishment is amore important determinant of the composition of naturalplant populations than is seed availability in many species[27,28]. Germination timing influences fitness by alteringthe expression of flowering time and other important life-history characters in the annual plant species, Arabidopsisthaliana and Campanulastrum americanum [29-31]. InA. thaliana, seed dormancy QTL colocalize with QTLaffecting total lifetime fitness, and epistatic loci affectboth traits under field conditions [32]. Clearly, germin-ation phenology influences plant fitness within a gener-ation, but it is equally sensitive to transgenerationalinfluences, which are less well understood, especially inregard to their genetic basis.Germination phenology is highly sensitive to the ma-ternal genotype, phenotype, and environment [30,33-41].Maternal flowering day and subsequent timing of seeddispersal can alter germination season in the next gener-ation [34]. Seed size may also affect germination. Studieshave found a positive association between seed size andgermination percentage or timing in numerous plantspecies [42], although faster emergence times in smallerseeds have also been demonstrated [43-45]. Despite ex-tensive ecological correlations between seed charactersand germination, few studies have mapped QTL forthese traits within the same study, and those that havefound no QTL affecting both seed size and germinationpercentage or rate [25,46]. In addition, we are unawareof any study mapping QTL for maternal flowering andprogeny germination phenology.In this study, we examine the quantitative-genetic struc-ture and QTL architecture of bolting time and reproduct-ive fitness characters in recombinant inbred lines ofBrassica rapa developed from a cross between a seed oilcultivar and wild-like genotype. QTL mapping was con-ducted in similar greenhouse and field experiments inorder to assess how accurately QTL studies in simulatedenvironments can be extrapolated to the field. In thegreenhouse environment, we also examine the relationshipbetween germination phenology and the maternal charac-ters. Brassica rapa is an internationally cultivated seed oiland vegetable crop and a parent of the hybrid-originmustard crops, B. napus (canola) and B. juncea (Indianmustard) [47]. Numerous genetic resources have beendeveloped for this species [22,23,48,49], and the firstreference sequence for B. rapa was released in 2011[50]. Naturalized populations of B. rapa are distributedthroughout the United States and often occur in dis-turbed habitats or the margins of agricultural fields[51,52]. Wild B. rapa are highly phenotypically variable,ranging from smaller, rapidly-developing spring annualsto larger biennials [52]. Although QTL affecting fruitand seed traits have been identified in a few B. rapa cul-tivars [53], no study mapping reproductive fitness QTLin a cross between a seed oil cultivar and a wild-likepopulation has been reported.MethodsStudy systemThe recombinant inbred lines (RILs) used in this studyhave been previously described in detail [48,54,55].Briefly, the RILs were derived from a cross between twoinbred B. rapa lines, the seed oil cultivar, yellow sarson(R500), and a rapid-cycling genotype (IMB211). Yellowsarson is a highly inbred, annual B. rapa cultivated inIndia for over 3,000 years [56]. IMB211 is derived fromthe Wisconsin Fast Plant™ (WFP) population producedby selection for short generation time [57]. The parentalgenotypes differ greatly for several reproductive fitnesstraits. R500 produces the large, heavy, yellow seeds typ-ical of B. rapa cultivars, and IMB211 produces smaller,lighter, brown seeds more similar to naturalized B. rapapopulations. IMB211 is phenotypically similar to rapid-developing B. rapa in the United States, and its averageflowering day and height are within the range of wild-collected B. rapa [52]. The RILs were developed fromself-fertilization of a F1 individual resulting from theDechaine et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 2 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66R500 × IMB211 cross, and the resulting F2s were propa-gated by single-seed descent to the S6 generation [48].Experimental environmentsSeeds of 147 RILs and the parental lines were planted inan agricultural field at the University of Minnesota, SaintPaul, MN, April 29–31, 2004. In each of three subplots,four plants of each RIL were planted at 20 cm spacingfrom each other and the next RIL, resulting in three setsof four adjacent replicates within each RIL. This experi-ment was part of a larger one examining multiple com-petitive environments, and further details of the designhave been previously described [55]. Bolting date wasscored as the date when buds first differentiated fromthe apical meristem. All flowers were naturally open-pollinated in the field. Plants began to naturally senesce(leaves and stem began to turn brown and dry) in thefirst week of August and were harvested once 50% ofthe rosette leaves had senesced on all individuals. Atharvest, fruits (siliques) were counted on each plant,and four mature (fully developed) fruits were collectedat random from 3–5 replicates of a RIL. Seeds werecounted in each fruit, and the length of the longest fruitwas measured. Seeds were then pooled within a plant,and seeds-per-fruit, seed mass, seed area, and seed colorwere determined. Seeds-per-fruit is the mean number ofseeds in the 2 longest collected fruit. Seed mass wascalculated as the average mass of 20 randomly chosenseeds from the collected fruit. Ten seeds from eachplant were then photographed, and their area and colorwere determined using ImagePro software, which quan-tifies pixels in digital photographs of the sample (Image-Pro Plus V4.5 2001). The trait, seed color, was obtainedas the score of the first principal component identifiedin principal components analysis, using varimax rota-tion, on pixel densities of three colors: red, green, andblue (PROC FACTOR; SAS, 2001). The first principalcomponent, which was weighted most heavily in redand green, explained greater than 67% of the variation.A lower value for seed color indicates darker, morewild-like seeds.Fitness traits were also recorded in a greenhouse experi-ment. Due to space limitations, the greenhouse experi-ment was conducted over two temporally separated trials,spaced a month apart. In the first trial, on March 14th,2007, we planted 8 replicates of each of the parental linesand 137 of the 160 B. rapa RILs into 3 in3 pots, filled withMetromix 200 soil, in greenhouses at the University ofMinnesota, Saint Paul, MN. Bolting date was recorded foreach individual using the same method as in the field, andthese plants were then harvested.Seeds were planted for the second experimental trialon April 17th, 2007 using the same RILs and in themanner described above. Six replicates per line wereplanted. At 5 days after bolting, plants began flowering,and the number of open flowers was recorded daily. Themajority of flowers were allowed to self-pollinate naturally,except that flowers at the 6th and 7th nodes were self-fertilized by hand in order to more closely simulate theeffect of pollinators in the field. In early June, the plantsbegan to senesce. At senescence, fruits were counted oneach plant, and fruits 6 and 7 (or those fruits arisingfrom hand-pollination) were collected. Fruit length wasmeasured on the longest of the fruits, and the seeds ineach collected fruit were counted. Seeds were pooledwithin a plant, and seed traits were measured as in thefield.Germination characteristics of the seeds collected inthe greenhouse experiment were also examined. Seedscollected from the 2 parental lines and RILs with at least3 replicate plants that set seed were pooled and storedin darkness at room temperature. While excluding RILswith fewer than 3 replicate plants artificially eliminateslines with low viability, this sampling approach helps re-duce microenvironmental bias. To further limit microen-vironmental maternal effects, the same number of seedswere pooled from each replicate within a RIL combinationif possible. Six replicates of 5–10 seeds per RIL were ger-minated in 3 Conviron E7/2 growth chambers (ControlledEnvironments Ltd., Winnipeg, Canada) in 2 temporalblocks from February 1–12, 2007 and from March 20–30,2007. One replicate of each RIL was located in eachgrowth chamber and temporal block, and replicates wererandomized within a growth chamber. All seeds wereplanted onto 0.5% agar in 4.5 cm diameter plastic Petridishes under a green safe light and then allowed to imbibewater for 24 h in darkness before being moved into thegrowth chambers. Each growth chamber was fitted with 8white florescent lights (Silvania Octron, F038/871, 32 W),2 infrared lights (Industrial Infrared, F32T8/IR-750),and 4 incandescent lights (Sylvania Double Life, SoftWhite, 120 V/75 W) that generated a R:FR of 1.1 andPAR of 130 – 160 μmol m−2 s−1. Germination trials used12 L:12D lighting and temperatures of 24D:20 N °C.Germination was checked daily for 10 days and scoredwhen the cotyledons appeared green and open to ~90°.Germination percent and day were calculated by divid-ing the number of seeds germinated by the seed totaland by averaging the germination days for all seeds in areplicate Petri dish, respectively.Quantitative genetic analysisFor all traits, a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)approach (PROC MIXED, SAS 2001) was used to parti-tion variation attributable to RIL (VL), spatial blocking(VB), and residual error (VR) within each environment.The blocking term was subplot for all traits in the fieldand greenhouse, and temporal block and chamber forDechaine et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 3 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66the germination traits measured in the growth chamber.Seed color and fruit length met the assumption of normal-ity in both the field and the greenhouse environments, butall remaining traits were transformed using a Box-Coxprocedure [58]. All transformations greatly improvednormality and homoscedasticity, and results from thetransformed data are reported.Broad-sense heritabilities were calculated as VL/VP,where, again,VL equals the among-RIL variance compo-nent and VP equals the total phenotypic variance for atrait. Least-square means, 95% confidence limits, andbest linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) deviations weregenerated for each RIL using the transformed versionsof the traits. BLUP deviations and least-square meanswere summed, and the resulting values were back-transformed for use in the QTL analysis. The parentalgenotypes, plants that died before bolting, and RILswith fewer than 3 replicates for a trait were removedfrom the analyses. Final sample sizes ranged from 730to 1160 (out of a possible 3600) in the field and 910 to1400 (out of a possible 2466) in the greenhouse. BLUPswere also used to estimate genetic correlations (rG) withineach environment (PROC CORR, SAS 2001). Differencesin bivariate matrix structure across environments wastested using Flury’s hierarchical common principal com-ponents (CPC) analysis, using the “jump-up approach”and Fisher’s Z-test [59-61]. Cross-environment correla-tions (rGE) for each trait were calculated as cov1,2/√(V1,1 × V1,2); cov12 is the covariance of a trait across twoenvironments and V1,1 and V1,2 are the among-RIL vari-ances within each environment [62,63].QTL-analysis. The R500 × IMB211 RILs were geno-typed at 227 RFLP and SSR markers across 10 linkagegroups, representing the 10 chromosomes in B. rapa.Marker order for the linkage map was estimated fromrecombination frequencies observed in the entire popu-lation of 160 RILs, i.e., from the most complete dataset,in earlier experiments [48]. Centimorgan distances werethen re-estimated in the RILs included in the field andgreenhouse experiments presented here (those that sur-vived to bolting) to account for slight differences thatmight exist due to unsampled recombination events.The map distances for each marker locus were calculatedfrom the estimated recombination frequencies using theKosambi mapping function in RQTL (R DevelopmentCore Team 2010). Twelve markers were uninformative,leaving 215 markers at unique positions in the finalre-estimated linkage map.QTL were mapped using the composite interval map-ping (CIM) procedure in QTL Cartographer [64]. To con-trol for effects of variation segregating elsewhere in thegenome, we identified co-factors using forward-backwardregression, and a 5-cM window; a maximum of 5 co-factors was selected for inclusion in the mapping model.We scanned for QTL at 2-cM intervals across the B. rapagenome. The significance threshold of the likelihood-ratiotest statistic (LR) was determined for each trait in eachtreatment independently by randomly permuting theBLUPs 1000 times. QTL with LRs significant at α = 0.05are reported [65] with 2-LOD support limits [66]. Additiveeffects and the genetic variance explained by a QTL werecalculated in QTL Cartographer, and confirmed using aGLM model with all QTL detected in the genome-widescreen as main effects [67]. For a given locus, a positiveadditive effect indicates that the IMB211 parent allele con-ferred a higher value for the trait. Analysis of variance(ANOVA) was used to test for QTL × environment inter-actions across the field and greenhouse environments; allsignificant main-effect QTL for the trait, environment,and QTL × environment effects on each genotypic traitmean were included in the model (PROC GLM, SAS2001).ResultsDescriptive statisticsRILs varied significantly (P < 0.001) in phenotypic ex-pression of all traits in both environments, indicatingunderlying genetic variation (Additional file 1: Table S1;Figure 1). Broad-sense heritabilities (H2) were smaller inthe field (range, 0.08-0.79) than the greenhouse (range,0.26-0.86) for all traits except fruit total (Table 1). We de-tected 7 QTL affecting 6 traits in the field and 12 QTL af-fecting 8 traits in the greenhouse (Table 2A and B;Figure 2). For any trait, a single QTL explained 5–56%(greenhouse) or 5–59% (field) of the variance (Table 2).Alleles derived from IMB211 had both positive andnegative effects on the majority of traits with > 1 QTLin one or both environments, with the exception thatthe IMB211 allele always decreased the trait value fordays to bolting, seed mass, and seed color.Genetic architecture between environmentsSingle trait genotypic correlations between environmentswere positive and significant for days to bolting, fruitlength, seed mass, and seed color (Table 3). Consistentwith the correlations, the majority of QTL for these traitsdid not exhibit significant QTL × environment interactions(Table 2). Seed color had the highest heritability andcross-environment correlation, and we detected only onelarge-effect QTL for this trait that was expressed in bothenvironments. These results suggest that the QTL archi-tecture for the majority of fitness traits examined in thisstudy was at least partially conserved between the green-house and field.By contrast, genotypic correlations were non-significantfor fruit total between environments (Table 3). Three ofthe five QTL affecting fruit total, including all QTL de-tected in the field for this trait, were environment-specific,Dechaine et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 4 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66in that the QTL × environment effects were significant(Table 2). QTL × environment effects were also significantfor one QTL affecting each of days to bolting, fruit length,seeds-per-fruit, and seed mass, indicating that at leastsome of the genetic loci affecting each reproductive char-acter, except seed color, were environment-specific or thatfunctional differences between alleles at these QTL weremanifested only in one environment.Relationship among components of fitnessA number of bivariate correlations were conserved be-tween environments. RILs that produced more fruit alsoproduced more seeds-per-fruit, and longer fruits generallyhad heavier seeds and more seeds (although the fruitlength/seeds-per-fruit correlation was significantly stron-ger in the greenhouse) (Table 3). Plants that producedmore seeds-per-fruit also had darker seeds (negative valuefor seed color) in both environments.Environmental differences in bivariate correlationswere also observed. Plants that produced more fruit andmore seeds-per-fruit also had heavier seeds in the field,but these correlations were not significant in the green-house (although the difference between environmentswas not large enough to be statistically significant forthe seeds-per-fruit/seed mass correlation). These resultssuggest that genotypic differences in resource acquisition37.540.042.5Days to Bolting16.026.036.0Days to Bolting25.050.075.0Fruit Length (mm)0.025.055.0Fruit Total0.08.016.0Seeds-per-Fruit1.22.02.8Seed Mass (mg)Seed Color -1.5 0.0 1.550 02.43.24.04.8Field GreenhouseDays to GerminationField  Greenhouse50 00.80.90.9Germination Percentage5050Figure 1 Frequency histograms of best-linear unbiased predictors for reproductive fitness traits in the Brassica rapa R500 × IMB211recombinant inbred line population field and greenhouse environments.

BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 5 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66existed among plants grown in the field, that is, genotypeswith high acquisition had higher output for all reproduct-ive components than those with lower acquisition. In thegreenhouse, plants did not generally produce both moreseeds and larger seeds, suggesting that the genotypic dif-ferences in acquisition were smaller in this environment.The relationship between seed mass and color also dif-fered between environments. Although the bivariatecorrelation between seed mass and color was positive inthe greenhouse, the scatter plot showed a sharp increasein seed mass in the darkest colored seeds (Additionalfile 2: Figure S1), indicating that the lightest and darkestseeds had the largest mass. This relationship was notconserved in the field. Interestingly, significant Z-testdifferences indicated that the relationship between seedcolor and seed mass or fruit total reversed between en-vironments, although the relationship between thesetraits was too weak in each environment for the major-ity of bivariate correlations to be significant.The field-specific positive relationship between fruittotal, seeds-per-fruit, and seed mass was consistent withFQTL1-1, which decreased the value for all three traits inthe field and had a significant QTL × environment inter-action effect for fruit total (Table 2). Moreover, GHQTL9-2 had opposing effects on fruit total versus seed mass, andthe QTL × environment effects were significant for thesetraits (Table 2; Figure 2). These results indicate thatGHQTL9-2 conferred environment-specific differences inresource allocation to reproductive fitness traits.Transgenerational fitnessIn the greenhouse environment, we examined the rela-tionships between reproductive characters of the mater-nal parent and germination patterns in the progeny.Interestingly, later bolting maternal plants producedfaster germinating seeds, suggesting a phenological rela-tionship across generations (Table 3). This relationshipwas consistent with GHQTL10-1, which increased timeto germination but decreased time to bolting (Table 2;Figure 2), providing evidence of transgenerational an-tagonistic pleiotropy at this locus. We also observed apositive relationship between both seed mass and seeds-per-fruit and germination percentage, suggesting that morevigorous maternal genotypes partition more resources tooffspring and produce many large seeds that also germinateto a higher percentage.DiscussionIn the current study, we examined the genetic architectureof reproductive fitness components, a topic of interest toboth agronomists seeking to increase yield and evolution-ary biologists interested in predicting response to selectionTable 1 Quantitative genetic partitioning of variance components and trait means in the field (F) and greenhouse (GH)environmentsVL VR H2 (VL/VP) Means (CL)Trait F GH F GH F GH F GHDays to bolting 0.79 0.00 5.07 0.00 0.13 0.71 40.69 23.65(41.12-40.26) (21.95-25.63)Fruit length 36.21 106.94 69.00 71.44 0.33 0.60 39.07 50.38(37.3-40.84) (48.30-52.47)Fruit total 0.48 0.64 1.05 1.36 0.30 0.30 19.12 9.44(15.22-24.01) (7.78-11.26)Seeds-per-fruit 0.03 0.57 0.31 0.77 0.08 0.42 3.41 8.52(2.31-4.85) (7.49-9.61)Seed mass 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.23 0.49 2.64 1.99(2.48-2.81) (1.86-2.14)Seed color 0.59 0.86 0.15 0.14 0.79 0.86 0.04 0.06(−0.11-0.19) (−0.12-0.23)Days to germination - 0.00 - 0.00 - 0.26 - 3.33(1.50-12.92)Germination percentage - 0.02 - 0.04 - 0.30 - 0.98(0.75-1.11)Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of the among-RIL variance component (VL), the residual variance component (VR), and the broad sense heritability (H2),calculated as VL/(VP); VP is the total phenotypic variance component.

BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 6 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66in quantitative traits. QTL that are consistently expressedamong environments are favorable targets for marker-assisted selection in the development of widely distributedagricultural varieties [9]. We detected QTL affectingseeds-per-fruit, seed mass, and fruit length on A1 in boththe greenhouse and field environments. These results areconsistent with a fruit length QTL previously mappednear the center of A1 in B. rapa [53,68], as well as QTL af-fecting seed mass [6] and multiple reproductive fitnesstraits on A1 in B. napus [9,69]. Shi et al. (2009) detectedseveral linked consensus QTL each affecting multiple seedor fruit traits on A1 in B. napus, indicating significantpleiotropy and physical linkage among fitness loci on thischromosome. Given the large influence of sections of A1on reproductive fitness and yield, this chromosome shouldbe a primary target for fine-mapping and candidate genescreening using association analyses in Brassica species.Aside from the number and size of seeds, seed oil is acommon target of selection among B. rapa varieties, andselection for seed oil phenotypes leads to a differenti-ation in seed color between cultivated and wild geno-types [70,71]. In the current study, seed color was highlyconserved across environments.

This sup-ports previous studies mapping seed color to one or afew genes on A9 in B. rapa [23,49]. The candidate geneBrTT8 has been identified in this region and shown tocontrol the accumulation of proanthocyanidins in theseed coat [71,72]. These results suggest that QTL map-ping data from greenhouse studies can be extrapolatedto field work for loci with a large additive geneticcomponent.Despite some shared genetic control, at least one QTLfor all traits other than seed color was detected in onlyone environment, suggesting environment-specific effectson fitness traits. Fruit total was largely environment-specific; the genotypic correlation across environmentswas non-significant for fruit total and seeds-per-fruit, andwe detected significant QTL × environment effects for 3 ofthe 5 QTL affecting fruit total. These results indicate thatthe genetic architecture of overall reproductive output(total fruit production) is more environmentally sensitivethan other seed and fruit traits. A recent meta-analysis ofQTL in B. napus that found that 63% of QTL affectingtotal seed yield were microenvironment-specific versus47% of QTL for all fitness traits measured [9]. Moreover,85% of seed yield QTL colocalized with QTL for at leastone other life history or reproductive fitness trait [9]. Inthe current study, all but 1 fruit total QTL affected mul-tiple traits, indicating that different aspects of reproductiveoutput are determined by multiple closely linked or pleio-tropic loci.Fine-mapping studies have found clustered, pleiotropicQTL affecting various life history and fitness characters inrice [5], wheat [73], pea [74], and B. napus [9]. Selectionfor any one of these QTL is likely to have far reachingconsequences on plant fitness. If, for example, QTL clus-ters correspond to genes regulating coordinated steps inseed development, then selection may have desirableoutcomes on several traits, such as an increase in seedsize and protein content [74]. Alternatively, antagonisticassociations among QTL, as has been found for oiltraits in B. juncea [75], may result in negative, nontargetconsequences on desirable traits. In our study, a parentalallele generally had the same direction of effect on all traitsat a QTL, thus supporting coordinated gene regulationof reproductive fitness traits. The only exception wasGHQTL9-2, which had opposing effects on fruit totaland seed mass in the greenhouse environment, leadingto conditional neutrality in the relationship betweenthese traits that differed between the greenhouse andfield [76]. Moreover, the opposing effects of GHQTL9-2on fruit total and seed mass suggests that antagonisticpleiotropy may control allocation of resources to seedsize versus seed production in B. rapa, similar to whathas been described in A. thaliana [7].In natural systems, seed germination and establishmentare no less important indicators of reproductive fitnessthan seed traits. Our study provides QTL support fortransgenerational co-regulation of life history phenology.Later bolting maternal plants produced seeds that ger-minated earlier, consistent with opposing effects ofSQTL10-1 on these traits. Our results support previouswork demonstrating an adaptive association betweenmaternal flowering time and germination season inCampanulastrum americanum [30,34]. Early floweringC. americanum plants produce seeds that disperse earlierand thus germinate earlier because of environmental cues,and strong negative genetic correlations between maternalflowering day and offspring germination timing havebeen observed in this species [35]. Our results provideQTL support for negative across-generation co-regulationof flowering and germination timing in B. rapa, similar towhat has been observed in C. americanum.The observed negative relationship between days tobolting and germination timing in our study was consist-ent with opposing effects of SQTL10-1 on these traits,suggesting that in this region there is an important regula-tory locus or cluster of loci influencing phenology betweengenerations. SQTL10-1 was flanked by BrFLC1, which isTable 3 Broad-sense genotypic correlations among traits in the field (above diagonal) and greenhouse (belowdiagonal) environmentsDays to bolting Fruit length Fruit total Seeds-per-fruit Seed mass Seed color Days to germDays to bolting 0.56**** −0.03 0.14 0.22* −0.11 −0.14 -Fruit length −0.17* 0.61**** 0.28*** 0.27*** 0.41**** 0.00 -Fruit total 0.08 0.16^ −0.04 0.20* 0.33** 0.13 -Seeds-per-fruit −0.04 0.59**** 0.32**** 0.12 0.35**** −0.32** -Seed mass −0.07 0.20* −0.06 0.06 0.25* −0.09 -Seed color 0.12 −0.05 −0.12 −0.21* 0.24** 0.80**** -Days to germination −0.31** 0.17^ −0.16 0.00 0.21* −0.05 -Germ percentage 0.10 0.08 0.00 0.25** 0.26** 0.09 -.16^Cross-environmental correlations for each trait are on the diagonal.

BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:66 Page 9 of 12http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/66collinear to FLC in A. thaliana [77]. A. thaliana FLC hasbeen shown to act through the flowering time pathway tomaternally-regulate germination [78] and is subject totransgenerational epigenetic regulation [78-80]. In B. rapa,a study examining flowering time in a backcross popula-tion between biennial and annual B. rapa suggested thatmost of the variation in flowering time between these lifehistories was due to FLC loci, including FLC1 [77]. Here,flowering time was variable, and it is unknown if SQTL10-1 would have affected germination time if flowering hadbeen synchronous among RILs. FLC1 is a likely candidategene for transgenerational regulation of evolutionarily im-portant life history phenology in multiple plant speciesand warrants further investigation of its direct and indirect(through flowering time) effects on germination undernatural conditions.ConclusionsThis is the first study to have characterized the correlationstructure and QTL architecture of important fitness/yieldtraits in a crop × wild-like population of B. rapa. Days tobolting, fruit length, and seed color, were highly correlatedand displayed QTL-colocalization across environments.Genetic characterization of these traits in controlled set-tings may readily translate to improvement in field envi-ronments. Total fruit number was uncorrelated acrossenvironments and most QTL affecting this trait werecorrespondingly environment-specific, suggesting thatthe genetic architecture of overall reproductive outputis more environmentally sensitive than other measuredfitness traits. Finally, BrFLC1 was identified as a potentialcandidate gene affecting transgenerational regulation offlowering time and seed germination.Additional filesAdditional file 1: Table S1.
