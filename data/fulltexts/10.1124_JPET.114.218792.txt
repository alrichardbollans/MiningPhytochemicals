Although this approach has yielded many anticancerdrugs, these drugs produce undesirable side effects. Analternative strategy is needed, and targeting mitotic exit may beone alternative approach. Localization of phosphorylated barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) to the chromosomal core region isessential for nuclear envelope compartment relocalization. In thisstudy, we isolated brazilin from Caesalpinia sappan Leguminosaeand demonstrated that it inhibited BAF phosphorylation in vitroand in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated direct binding betweenbrazilin and BAF. The inhibition of BAF phosphorylation inducedabnormal nuclear envelope reassembly and cell death, indicatingthat perturbation of nuclear envelope reassembly could be a novelapproach to anticancer therapy. We propose that brazilin isolatedfrom C. sappan may be a new anticancer drug candidate thatinduces cell death by inhibiting vaccinia-related kinase 1–mediatedBAF phosphorylation.IntroductionDrugs that depolymerize and stabilize microtubules, in-cluding vinca alkaloids (vinblastine and vincristine) andtaxanes (paclitaxel/taxol and docetaxel), have long been usedto treat cancer (Jordan and Wilson, 2004; Dumontet andJordan, 2010). In addition to their anticancer effects, however,these drugs cause various side effects. To avoid this problem,researchers have attempted to develop drugs that indirectlytarget microtubules via microtubule regulator proteins, suchas polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), Aurora A and B, and Eg5 (Blangyet al., 1995; Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003; Barr et al., 2004).However, some cancer cells that are treated with these drugsskip mitotic arrest and survive as a result of adaptation ormitotic slippage in which the spindle assembly checkpointdoes not activate cell cycle arrest after chromosomal segrega-tion, resulting in the maintenance of aneuploidy (Rieder andMaiato, 2004; Brito and Rieder, 2006). Thus, rather thantargeting spindle assembly, an alternative strategy of target-ing mitotic exit has been proposed (Manchado et al., 2012). Incontrast to strategies that rely on microtubule disruption,directly targeting mitotic exit does not promote adaptation ormitotic slippage. Therefore, if cancer cells are damaged atmitotic exit, they cannot escape death. To date, however,drugs that target mitotic exit have not been commonly used.To complete mitotic exit, nuclear membrane reformationand cytokinesis must take place. Nuclear envelope reassem-bly is a phenomenon in which the nuclear membrane andassociated proteins, such as barrier-to-autointegration factor(BAF), LEM-domain proteins (LAP2, emerin, and MAN1),lamin, and nuclear pore complex, relocate around separatedchromosomes during telophase (Haraguchi et al., 2001;Dechat et al., 2004). BAF is the first of the nuclearmembrane–associated proteins to be recruited to the coreregion, the central region of the assembling nuclear rim nearspindle microtubules during nuclear envelope reformation(Haraguchi et al., 2008). Relocalization of BAF into the coreregion of chromosomes leads to recruitment of other nuclearmembrane–anchored proteins and nuclear envelope trans-membrane proteins. Therefore, BAF is key in controlling theescape of dividing cells from mitotic exit.

InCaenorhabditis elegansembryos, depletion of the VRK1 homolog abolishes targetingof the BAF-1 homolog to the core-like region and preventsnuclear envelope reformation (Gorjanacz et al., 2007). Indeed,BAF phosphorylation by VRK1 is required for nuclearenvelope reassembly, although the process is so complex thatthe detailed molecular mechanism remains elusive.We hypothesized that inhibition of VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation might trigger severe cell cycle defectsbecause BAF phosphorylation is essential for nuclear enve-lope reassembly. To identify novel inhibitors of BAF phos-phorylation, we screened a natural herb library. To date,natural products have been used to develop new treatmentsfor many diseases. Plants contain a variety of metabolites fordefense, communication, and predation, some of which haveanticancer effects (Cragg et al., 2009). As a result, more than70% of commercial anticancer drugs have been derived fromor inspired by natural products (Gordaliza, 2007; Cragg et al.,2009).Our screen revealed that Caesalpinia sappan extractinhibited VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation. Subse-quently, brazilin was isolated from the extract as a BAFinhibitor. C. sappan heartwood has been used as a traditionalmedicine for various diseases. Brazilin, one of the mainC. sappan components (Puchtler et al., 1986), is reported topossess various biologic effects, including anti-inflammatoryactivity (Hikino et al., 1977; Bae et al., 2005), antihepatotox-icity activity (Moon et al., 1992), induction of immunologictolerance (Choi and Moon, 1997; Mok et al., 1998), inhibitionof downstream cAMP signaling (Won et al., 2004), inhibitionof protein kinase C and insulin receptor kinase (Kim et al.,1998), and antiplatelet activity (Hwang et al., 1998). Indeed,its cytotoxic properties as an antitumor agent have previouslybeen reported (Kim et al., 2012). However, the detailedmolecular mechanisms underlying these properties areunclear.In this study, we isolated brazilin from C. sappan afterscreening a natural herb library for inhibitors of VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation. We found that (1) brazilininhibited BAF phosphorylation by VRK1 in vitro and in vivoand (2) the abrogation of BAF phosphorylation is the result ofdirect binding between BAF and brazilin. Brazilin-mediatedinhibition of BAF phosphorylation triggers a defect in nuclearenvelope reassembly at the onset of telophase, eventuallyresulting in cell death. The anticancer effect of brazilin wasalso validated in vivo. On the basis of these results, wepropose that brazilin should be considered a candidate fora new class of anticancer drugs that target mitotic exit.Materials and MethodsGeneral Experimental ProceduresOptical rotation was measured using a JASCO P-1020 polarimeter(Jasco Analytical Instruments, Easton, MD).

To generatethe BAF and VRK1 expression constructs, the full-length BAF andVRK1 genes were amplified from HeLa cells using the polymerasechain reaction. Each amplicon was cloned into phospho-enhancedgreen fluorescent protein-C1, phospho-Discosoma fluorescent red(DsRed)-Monomer-N1, and pProEX (Clontech, Takara Bio, Shiga,Japan). To purify recombinant glutathione S-transferase-VRK1, His-VRK1, and His-BAF, Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformedwith pGEX-4T-3-VRK1, pProEX-VRK1, or pProEX-BAF and expressedproteins were purified using Ni-NTA beads (Invitrogen/Life Technol-ogies, Carlsbad, CA).176 Kim et al. at ASPET Journals on July 18, 2019jpet.aspetjournals.orgDownloaded from Cell Culture and TransfectionThe A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 andDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium–high-glucose media, respectively(HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) containing 10% fetal bovineserum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Welgene, Daegu,South Korea) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Tran-sient transfection was performed using an MP-100 microporator(Invitrogen/Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’sinstructions.Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase–MediatedDigoxigenin-Deoxyuridine Nick-End Labeling AssayA549 cells were transfected with DsRed-N1-monomer-BAF or, inthe case of controls, not transfected. Cells were grown on glass chipscoated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and then treated withbrazilin (100 mM) for different times. Cells were fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with Hoechst stainand the DeadEnd Fluorometric terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated digoxigenin-deoxyuridine nick-end labeling(TUNEL) system kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to themanufacturer’s instructions.Protein Kinase Assay and ImmunoblottingAn in vitro kinase assay was performed in accordance withmethodspreviously described elsewhere (Kim et al., 2013). In brief, an in vitrokinase assay was performed with His-VRK1 and its substrates,including His-BAF and His-H3 histone, in kinase buffer (50 mM 3-N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 25 mM b-glycerophosphate,10 mM EGTA, 4 mM EDTA, 50 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol)containing [g-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) or ATP (Sigma-Aldrich). Thekinase assay mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes.Radioactivity incorporation was detected by autoradiography, andphosphorylation of His-H3 histone was analyzed by immunoblotting.The quantities of proteins used in kinase assays were measured byusing silver nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or immunoblotting. Immunoblotanalysis was performed as we previously described elsewhere (Parket al., 2011). For immunoblot analysis, bands were visualized usingthe Western blot detection kit (Neuronex, Pohang, South Korea).Luteolin-Sepharose 4B Preparation and In Vitro Pull-DownAssayCNBr-sepharose 4B bead powder was suspended in activationsolution for coupling reaction. Activated Sepharose 4B beads wereincubated in coupling solution with brazilin on a rotary shaker at 4°Covernight. For the in vitro pull down assay, His-BAF or A549 celllysates transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-BAF wereincubated with brazilin-Sepharose 4B beads in reaction solution for12 hours. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblot-ting. Immnunoblotting was performed by using indicated antibodiesand following the detailed procedures described previously (Byunet al., 2010).Surface Plasmon ResonanceBAFwas immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran hydrogel surfacesensor chip (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) using a 10 mMsodium acetate, pH 5.0 immobilization buffer. The ligand wasprepared. Kinetic titration was performed using a running buffer of10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 1% dimethylsulf-oxide (DMSO). Analysis of the collected data were performed byscrubber2 software (BioNavis, Tampere, Pirkanmaa, Finland).Confocal MicroscopyA549 cells transfected with DsRed-N1-monomer-VRK1 or GFP-BAF were grown on a chip, and then treated with 50 mM brazilin for12 hours.

Cellswere observed using confocal microscopy.ImmunocytochemistryThe A549 cells were grown on a chip and then treated with 50 mMbrazilin for 12 hours. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehydepermeabilized in PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum, and stained withlamin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Hoechst. Cells wereobserved using confocal microscopy. We calculated the cells to showdiffused lamin B in cytosol of HeLa cells. Data represent the mean ofthree independent experiments 6 S.E.M. Each experiment has atleast three samples, and each sample had at least 50 cells.Flow CytometryCells were fixed with 70% ethanol containing 0.4% Tween 20.Cellular DNA was stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodide (Fluka,Buchs, Switzerland) and 100 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.Samples containing 5000 cells were analyzed using a FACS CaliburSystem (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).Mouse ExperimentWe randomly assigned 4-week-old athymic Balb/c nude male miceweighing 20 g into the following groups: 20 and 40 mg/kg brazilin (n53 per group), and control (n 5 2). Each mouse was injectedsubcutaneously with A549-FIG cells (5  106 cells/mouse). Whentumor size reached to ∼5 mm in diameter, mice were intratumorallytreated with 20 and 40 mg/kg brazilin, or 10% DMSO in PBS twicea week. Treatment continued for 2 weeks. Tumor growth wasmonitored using both in vivo bioluminescence imaging and tumorvolume measurement with caliper (length  width  height  0.52).Bioluminescence imaging was performed using the IVIS Lumina II(Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA), which included a highlysensitive charge-coupled device camera mounted on a light-tightspecimen chamber. The D-luciferin potassium salt (Caliper LifeSciences) was diluted to 3 mg/100 ml in PBS before use, and the micewere injected intraperitoneally with 100 ml of this D-luciferin solution.After 10 minutes, the mice were placed individually in the specimenchamber and then were measured with light emitted by luciferase.Grayscale photographic images and bioluminescent color imageswere superimposed using LIVINGIMAGE, version 2.12 (Xenogen,Alameda, CA), and IGOR image analysis FX software (WaveMetrics,Lake Oswego, OR). Bioluminescence signals were expressed in unitsof photons per cm2 per second per steradian (P/cm2/s/sr). To quantifyemitted light, regions of interest were drawn over the tumor region,and total photon effluxes over an exposure time of 1 second weredetermined.ResultsCharacterization of Brazilin from C. sappan. VRK1 isthe sole BAF kinase identified to date. As natural compoundshave long been used to develop new drugs, we screeneda library composed of hundreds of natural product extracts toidentify a small molecule inhibitor of VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation (data not shown). A fraction isolated fromC. sappan L. significantly inhibited VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation in vitro (data not shown). Thus, we hypoth-esized it must contain an inhibitor of VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation. Next, we attempted to isolate the putativeVRK1 inhibitor from C. sappan (Supplemental Fig. 1). NMRspectrometry, MS, and IR spectrometry results indicated thatthe compound isolated was brazilin (Fig. 1, A–C).Brazilin as BAF Inhibitor 177 at ASPET Journals on July 18, 2019jpet.aspetjournals.orgDownloaded from Brazilin Inhibits VRK1-Mediated Phosphorylation ofBAF. To determine whether brazilin isolated from C. sappaninhibits VRK1-mediated phosphorylation of BAF, we per-formed an in vitro kinase assay using purified BAF andVRK1. Administration of between 3 and 10 mM of brazilindramatically reduced BAF phosphorylation. The half maxi-mal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated to beapproximately 5 mM (Fig. 2A). This indicates that C. sappanbrazilin is an effective inhibitor of VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation in vitro. By contrast, brazilin had no effect onVRK1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 2A). This indicates thatbrazilin does not directly inhibit VRK1 and is insteada specific inhibitor of VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation.Additionally, we found that brazilin did not affect VRK1-mediated H3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B; Supplemental Fig. 2).These data indicate that C. sappan brazilin specificallyinhibits BAF in vitro.Endogenous and ectopic VRK1 expression is localized inthe nucleus (Lopez-Borges and Lazo, 2000; Nichols andTraktman, 2004; Sevilla et al., 2004a,b), as is ectopic BAFexpression (Segura-Totten et al., 2002; Shimi et al., 2004).However, ectopic BAF expression can be transiently relocal-ized into the cytosol when VRK1 is coexpressed with BAF(Nichols et al., 2006). Relocation of BAF into the cytosol doesnot occur 1) when VRK1 is coexpressed with a BAF mutantthat cannot be phosphorylated or 2) when a VRK1 catalyticnull mutant is coexpressed with ectopic BAF (Nichols et al.,2006). These results indicate that VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation determines the location of ectopically ex-pressed BAF. Thus, by observing the location of ectopicallyexpressed BAF, we could infer whether VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation occurred.We used brazilin to treat cells in which DsRed-VRK1 wascoexpressed with GFP-BAF. Rather than being found in thecytosol, GFP-BAF was located in the nucleus (Fig. 2C;Supplemental Fig. 3A). The nuclear location of BAF in cellstreated with brazilin indicates that VRK1-mediated BAFphosphorylation did not occur (Fig. 2C, bottom). Treatmentwith DMSO resulted in the relocation of BAF into the cytosol,indicating that GFP-BAF was phosphorylated by ectopicallyexpressed VRK1 under these conditions. To confirm theinhibition of BAF phosphorylation by brazilin, we performedan immunoblotting assay. Brazilin treatment expectablyreduced BAF phosphorylation in A549 cells (SupplementalFig. 3B). These data show that brazilin inhibits VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation, supporting brazilin as a can-didate inhibitor of BAF phosphorylation.Brazilin Binds Specifically to BAF. To be an effectiveBAF phosphorylation inhibitor, brazilin should bind specifi-cally to BAF. Therefore we investigated whether brazilininteracts directly with BAF. First, we performed a pull-downassay to demonstrate binding between BAF and VRK1 invitro. Sepharose-4B beads were conjugated to the hydroxyl-group of brazilin, and the brazilin-conjugated beads wereincubated with lysate of cells that overexpressed BAF.Control beads that were not conjugated to brazilin did notinteract with BAF, and brazilin-conjugated beads bound toGFP-BAF but not to GFP (Fig. 3A). This suggests that brazilinformed a complex with the BAF present in the cell lysate.However, as other proteins in the cell lysate could alsopotentially form a complex with BAF, it was possible that theBAF-brazilin interaction resulted from indirect binding. Toexclude this possibility, we conducted another pull-downassay using recombinant BAF (Fig. 3B). When recombinantBAF was incubated with brazilin-conjugated beads, BAF waspulled down; however, no BAF was detected in associationwith control beads. This suggests that brazilin interactsdirectly with recombinant BAF.Next, we measured the strength of the interaction betweenbrazilin and BAF using surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 3C).We immobilized recombinant BAF on the surface of a goldchip, and then allowed brazilin to flow over the chip, from lowto high concentration. This kinetic titration method canperform as robustly as the classic injection method (KarlssonFig. 1. Brazilin was isolated from C. sappan. (A) Brazilin [1H]NMR and[13C]NMR data. (B) Brazilin MS data. (C) Chemical structure of brazilin.178 Kim et al. at ASPET Journals on July 18, 2019jpet.aspetjournals.orgDownloaded from et al., 2006). During the flow period, the intensity of theinteraction between brazilin and BAF was assessed via signalalterations. The dissociation constant (KD) was 38.35 mM,suggesting a good affinity between BAF and brazilin (Table 1).Brazilin Disrupts Nuclear Envelope Reassembly byInhibiting BAF Phosphorylation. BAF phosphorylationis a prerequisite for nuclear envelope reassembly duringtelophase (Haraguchi et al., 2008). Phosphorylation of BAFleads to its localization at the core region of the dividingchromosome, inducing the recruitment of other nuclearenvelope-associated proteins, including LEM-domain pro-teins, lamin, and nuclear pore complex. To determinewhether brazilin perturbs recruitment of nuclear envelope-associated proteins by blocking VRK1-mediated BAF phos-phorylation, we employed immunocytochemistry to observethe location of lamin during telophase. In cells treated withbrazilin, lamin dispersed outside the nucleus, whereas incontrol cells it was located around the rim of the nucleus, aspreviously reported (Fig. 4A). The number of cells with laminlocalization defects was 6-fold higher in brazilin-treated cellsrelative to control cells (Fig. 4B). These data show that controlcells progress normally from M phase to interphase, whereasnuclear envelope reformation is disrupted in brazilin-treatedcells. Similarly, in siRNA-vrk-1C. elegans embryos, the nuclearrim signals mAb414 and Nup96 disappear from the nuclearperiphery (Gorjanacz et al., 2007).Because nuclear envelope reformation is a final step inmitosis, failure of the nuclear envelope to reassemble coulddelay mitotic exit. To determine whether brazilin-mediatedinhibition of lamin reformation delays mitotic progression,we observed the cell cycle distribution of A549 cells usingflow cytometry. Treatment with brazilin increased theproportion of G2/M cells 1.5-fold relative to control cells(Fig. 4, C and D).G2/M arrest induced by brazilin in multiple myeloma U266cells has also been observed (Kim et al., 2012). These resultsimply that brazilin-induced disruption of lamin localizationperturbs normal cell cycle progression. In particular, brazilindisrupts recruitment of lamin to the anaphase chromatinsurface, delaying mitotic progression.Fig. 2. Brazilin suppresses VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. (A) In vitro kinase assay in which VRK1 and BAFwere exposed toincreasing concentrations of brazilin (0.0, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mM).

RFP, red fluorescent protein.Brazilin as BAF Inhibitor 179 at ASPET Journals on July 18, 2019jpet.aspetjournals.orgDownloaded from Brazilin Possesses Cytotoxicity by Inhibiting BAFPhosphorylation. A number of anticancer drugs inducemitotic arrest by activating cell cycle checkpoints, leadingto cell death unless the checkpoint problems are resolved.A limitation of this protective mechanism is that cancer cellsthat undergo mitotic arrest can also escape via adaptation orslippage. We hypothesized that targeting mitotic exit couldrepresent a novel strategy for overcoming this limitation, asa result of higher cytotoxicity and the failure to generateaneuploid cells. Thus, we tested whether brazilin induces celldeath.To examine the cytotoxicity of brazilin we performeda TUNEL assay with A549 cells. Brazilin treatment dramat-ically decreased cell numbers and appeared to promotegrowth retardation as well as cell death (Fig. 5A). Addition-ally, we monitored cell growth using live, long-term contentimaging. When 25 mM brazilin was administered to 60%confluent cells, the number of cells no longer increased, andthen the density decreased. These data indicate that brazilinconcentrations greater than 25 mM induce growth retarda-tion, followed by cell death (Fig. 5B).Asmentioned above, brazilin-induced cell death is triggeredafter anaphase, when cell cycle checkpoint activation may notlead to mitotic arrest. We hypothesized that the cell deathavoidance processes, such as adaptation and slippage, whichresult from other microtubule inhibitors, would not occur inresponse to brazilin. To test this hypothesis, we used flowcytometry to study these processes.As expected, both brazilin and nocodazole, a microtubuleinhibitor, induced cell death. However, when gating was usedto select live cells, it became evident that nocodazoletreatment increased the aneuploid cell population, indicatingthat mitotic slippage and adaptation were triggered after cellcycle arrest (Weaver and Cleveland, 2005). By contrast,brazilin treatment did not generate aneuploid cells, indicatingthat adaptation and slippage were not triggered (Fig. 5C).These observations demonstrate that brazilin is cytotoxic tocancer cells and does not allow adaptation or slippage. Thedata support the idea that, rather than targeting micro-tubules or microtubule regulating proteins, targeting mitoticexit could represent a novel approach to cancer treatment thatis attractive because it does not generate aneuploid cells.We hypothesized that if brazilin is directly involved ininducing cell death by targeting BAF, ectopic expression ofDsRed-BAF should rescue brazilin-induced cytotoxicity. Indeed,the results of the TUNEL assay showed that ectopicallyexpressed BAF reduced brazilin-induced cell death (Fig. 5D).Thus, brazilin could induce cell death directly by targeting BAF.Finally, we examined the anticancer effects of brazilin ina mouse model. We generated an A549-FIG cell line infectedwith lenti-Fluc-IRES-GFP; cell numbers were calculated bymeasuring fluorescence intensity (Supplemental Fig. 4A). TheA549-FIG cells appeared to have proliferative abilities similarto those of normal A549 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4B),indicating that lenti-Fluc-IRES-GFP did not impair cellgrowth and reproduction. These cells were implanted on theventral aspect of the mouse. Tumor volume increased incontrol mice but decreased in mice treated with brazilin ina concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that brazilinhas anticancer effect in vivo (Fig. 5, E and F).DiscussionWe hypothesized that targeting BAF, and particularlyVRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation, would have severalFig. 3.

We screened a library ofnatural compounds and isolated brazilin, a BAF inhibitorfrom C. sappan. We confirmed that brazilin isolated fromC. sappan inhibits VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation invitro and in vivo. In addition, we determined that brazilin-induced BAF inhibition blocks nuclear envelope reformationduring telophase, inducing cell death in cancer cells.Brazilin has several merits as an anticancer drug. First,BAF is an excellent target compared with other cancer drugtargets, such as microtubules or microtubule regulatoryproteins. Despite reliable anticancer activity, microtubuleinhibitors have severe side effects. And contrary to expectation,at tolerable concentrations, microtubule regulatory proteininhibitors investigated as a substitute for microtubule blockershave displayed weak anticancer effects (Komlodi-Pasztor et al.,2012; Mitchison, 2012).We and other researchers expected that mitotic exit mightrepresent an alternative target, because it would not allowcancer cells to survive via mitotic slippage or adaptation. Anexample in support of this hypothesis is that tumor regressionis greater in response to a treatment ablating Cdc20, whichactivates anaphase promoting complex, than in response toothermitotic drugs currently used in cancer therapy (Manchadoet al., 2010).We selected brazilin, a BAF inhibitor, to target the end ofmitosis. BAF plays a role in recruiting nuclear envelope-associated proteins, including lamin, emerin, MAN1, andLAP2, to the chromosomal core region (Haraguchi et al.,Fig. 4. Suppression of BAF phosphorylation disrupts nuclear envelope assembly. (A) Immunocytochemical staining in HeLa cells after treatment withbrazilin 50 mM or DMSO.

Phos-phorylation by VRK1, a novel BAF kinase, determines BAFlocalization during nuclear envelope reassembly (Haraguchiet al., 2008;Molitor and Traktman, 2014). Therefore, inhibitionof VRK1-mediated BAF phosphorylation deserves attention inthe field of cancer treatment.Recently, it was reported that aberrant alterations ofnuclear envelope components, including lamin, emerin,LAP2, and nucleoporin, are connected to cancer development(Chow et al., 2012). Cancer cells often have altered nuclearstructures, including nuclear envelope invaginations andmultilobulation; in fact, these features are used in the clinicaldiagnosis of cancers (Fischer et al., 2004; Bussolati, 2008;Bussolati et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2009; Gorjanacz, 2014).Cancer cells are so susceptible to nuclear envelope alterationsthat drugs that disturb nuclear envelope distribution orreformation could easily induce cell death. Therefore, a treat-ment that weakens the nuclear envelope might displaysynthetic lethality (Gorjanacz, 2014). As BAF supportsnuclear envelope structures, the depletion or altered expres-sion of BAF results in nuclear envelope alterations (Molitorand Traktman, 2014). Therefore, targeting BAF could triggersynthetic lethality by destroying the weak nuclear envelope ofcancer cells. Because depletion of VRK1 disrupts nuclearenvelope morphology—consistent with the BAF mutationFig. 5. Brazilin triggers cell death by suppressing BAF phosphorylation.

We have reported thatObtusilactone B, an inhibitor of BAF phosphorylation,perturbs detachment of chromosomes from the nuclearenvelope at S phase and M phase entry, thus displayinganticancer activity (Kim et al., 2013). However, treatmentwith Obtusilactone B did not result in obstruction of telo-phase, which would be more effective. In this article, wepropose that blocking mitotic exit via brazilin-induced BAFinhibition may be a good target that results in cancer celldeath.The mechanism by which brazilin binds specifically to BAFand impairs only telophase progression, but not S phase,remains elusive. Brazilin may directly bind the Thr-2, Thr-3,and Ser-4 residues of BAF, which are known VRK1-mediatedBAF phosphorylation sites, or may act as an allostericinhibitor of BAF by binding another site. Structure-basedanalysis should be performed to identify the mechanism bywhich brazilin inhibits BAF.In addition, we note that brazilin could induce nuclearenvelope disturbance in normal cells as well as cancer cells.Brazilin-induced disruption of nuclear envelope structures issimilar to features observed in patients with progeria. In fact,a homozygous mutation in BANF1, the gene encoding BAF,has been detected in atypical progeria patients; the mutationreduces BAF stability, impairing nuclear envelope structure(Puente et al., 2011). Brazilin may accelerate aging byinterfering with the nuclear envelope reassembly of normalcells. However, the probability of this occurring during cancertreatment may not be significant because in progeria theearly-aging phenotype progresses over a long time period(Gorjanacz, 2014).AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Robert Craigie (US National Institutes ofHealth) for the gift of p-BAF antibody.Authorship ContributionsParticipated in research design: S.-H.
