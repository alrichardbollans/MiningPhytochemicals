Nosso interesse quimiotaxonômico sobre Neoraputia nos estimulou a examinar N. paraensis,
visando a busca de alcalóides. As frações foram monitoradas via RMN 1H e ESI-EM/EM e foram
analisadas somente aquelas cujos espectros apresentavam características de alcalóides do ácido
antranílico e flavonóides não isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcalóides flindersina,
skimmianina, 8-metoxiflindersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonóides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6-
(2",2"-dimetilpirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona,
3',4'-metilenodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e 5-hidroxi-3',4'-metilenodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona,. Os
alcalóides do ácido antranílico não foram encontrados em dez anos.
Vários flavonóides isolados de N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de
Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae) e Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) foram testados frente a
gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de Trypanosoma cruzi, visando verificar seus potenciais em
inibir a atividade da enzima. Os flavonóides polimetoxilados e um isoflavonóide foram os mais
ativos.
Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of N. paraensis searching
for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which
showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were
examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids flindersine, skimmianine, 8-methoxyflindersine and
dictamnine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8-
pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-
trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have
remained undiscovered for 10 years.
A number of flavonoids isolated from N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus
sinensis graft (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability
to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from
Trypanosoma cruzi. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives.

Introduction
Neoraputia species were originally described by Engler
as species of Raputia Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the
new genus Neoraputia Emmerich to accommodate six
species, four of them from Raputia and two new ones. These
two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous
investigations of Neoraputia reported the presence of eleven
polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2",2"-
dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)-
flavone and one flavanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich;2,3
five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'-
hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6'-(2",2"-
dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from N.

magnifica var. magnifica (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten
polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2",2"-
dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3”-hydroxy,3”-methyl-
trans-but-1”-enyl)-flavone from N. paraensis.6,7 All
phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been
undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda et al.6,7, and
isolation procedures used in these studies should have
revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they
had been present. If Emmerich’proposal is correct, that
Neoraputia is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be
regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus,
it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had
remained undiscovered in the Neoraputia because of their
low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the
chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature
to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an
argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which
produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated
flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical
investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a
better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the
Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken
a further investigation of N. paraensis.
Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma
cruzi, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people,
mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the
total population is at risk (World Health Organisation).
Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic
areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by
insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and
congenital transmission are currently the major causes for
the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs
currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have
strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite
Trypanosoma cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid
cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP
production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source
of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets
for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional
structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde-
3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the
oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows
potential target sites with significant differences compared
with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have
been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources,
and tested.9
Highly oxygenated flavones from Neoraputia
magnifica have shown to be the most actives as
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5
These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids.
Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids
isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica,
Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon
(Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were
assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme
GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi.
Results and Discussion
Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated
an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of
N. paraensis searching for alkaloids, which were detected
by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on
TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200
MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those
which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and
flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.
The dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only
the alkaloid flindersine (1).10 The HSQC and HMBC
experiments on flindersine, permitted minor corrections
to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that
the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The
observed correlations between the methine hydrogen
signal at δ 6.77 and the 13C signals at δ 162.5, 157.3 and
79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively.
The upfield methine hydrogen signal at δ 5.56 showed
correlation with the 13C signals at δ 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3
permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13
and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at δ 6.77 and 5.56
were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively.
The methanolic extract from stems afforded
skimmianine,11 8-methoxyflindersine (2)12 and
dictamnine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of 2 could be found in
the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and
unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for 2 were made using
the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using 1 and
haplophytin A (3)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen
signal at δ 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ
157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11
and C-4. Thus, in compound 1 and 2, H-11 is more deshielded
than H-12. However, in model 3 the presence of the methoxyl
at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for
4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being
more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces
effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement
for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data
were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15
The n-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-
tetramethoxy-5,6-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (4) which
has not been recorded from N. paraensis. The
dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids,
382 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (5), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-
tetramethoxyflavone17 (6), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-
trimethoxyflavone5 (7) and 8, which are reported for the first
time from N. paraensis, while the latter appears to be new.
The flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H
NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (δ 7.33, d, J
1.8 Hz, H-2'; δ 6.93, d, J 8.2 Hz, H-5'; δ 7.46, dd, J 8.2 and
1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two
methoxy groups (δ 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy
group (δ 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at δ 12.73 (1H,
s, OH-5) and two singlets at δ 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3)
indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted
and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17
fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good
indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-
rings. Thus, a combination of 1H NMR data and the
fragment ions at m/z 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%)
fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy
substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy
or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A
comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH-
6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7-
trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (ca. δ 96)
resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (ca. δ 91).18 Thus,

the correct A-ring was decided on the basis of 13C NMR
spectrum (Table 2) which showed signal at δ 90.6 for C-8,
so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-6. From
these data 8 was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'-
methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural
assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C
NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-
flavone (9)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy-
flavone (10).5
Preliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens
collected in Paragominas, state of Pará, north of Brazil, in
February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from
specimens originating from Uruçuca, Bahia (February 1993),
showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids
between the two collections. However, alkaloids were
obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which
is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy
summer in the northern (Pará). In contrast, Neoraputia alba
and N. magnifica collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast
of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus,
geographic-variation do not seem to be an important
environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate
alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have
remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were
obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine
(1) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg).
In a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics
of Cusparieae, which Neoraputia has been assigned,8 the
importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was
highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated
flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker
in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in
alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will
rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important
classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids,
since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm
plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more
attention than they have received so far.
A number of flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia
paraensis, N. magnifica,4,5 Murraya paniculata,19 Citrus
sinensis grafted on C. limon20 (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus
montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability
to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal
GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. The positive results are
summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids
evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited
by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2",2"-
dimethylpyrano)chalcone (11) was added to the assay
system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1, suggesting that
chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7-
pentamethoxyflavone (12), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone
(13), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (14) and flavonol
3’,4’,5’,3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (15) completely
inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 µg mL-1.
The activity does not appear to be affected by the
introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone

skeleton. However, the activity of 3’,4’,5’,3,5,7,8-
heptamethoxyflavonol (16) was comparable to that of 15
but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 µg mL-1.
This finding shows that the activity varies with the position
of methoxyl group. The higher activity of 12, 13, 14 and 15
could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron
density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy-
5,7-dimethoxyflavone (10) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-
trimethoxyflavone (7) do not display significant GAPDH
activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'-
methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity.
Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and
isoflavone afrormosine (17) inhibitory activities are not
significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy
groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity.
However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton
and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones
tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when
auronol derriobtusone A (18) was added to the assay system
at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1.

Thus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more
attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-
inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess
the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal
GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent
from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to
determine as precisely as possible, how the tested
compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how
they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the
target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough
experimental evidence for developing a quantitative
understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in
the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids
and the enzyme GAPDH.

Isolation of compounds
Ground stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of Neoraputia
paraensis were extracted with n-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and
finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts
containing alkaloids, which were detected by the
characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on thin-
layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were
monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and
were examined only those which showed features of
anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous
investigations.
The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was
subjected to column chromatography over silica gel.
Elution with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded
16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica
gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 1
(10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned
into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The
concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to
column chromatography over silanized silica elution with
MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash
chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH
gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash
chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-
EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-
MeOH (4.6: 0.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg).
Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was
a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle
size, 100 Å pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1);
flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 254 nm) to give 2
(second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg),
after four cycles of 80 min.
The concentrated n-hexane extract of the leaves was
four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting
with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc-
MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with
silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc
gradient affording 4 (20 mg).
The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash
chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-
EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc
gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by
R-HPLC (the column used was a Shodex Asahipack GS-
310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection
UV, λ 240 nm) to give 8 (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three
cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by
R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give 5
(second peak, 5.0 mg), 6 (second peak, 4.0 mg) and 7
(second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min,
respectively.

Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi
GAPDH
TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported
by Souza et al.9 It is maintained in the Crystallography
Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP,
Brazil.
T. cruzi GAPDH-activity
TcGAPDH activity was determined according to a
386 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
modification of a previously reported procedure.23 Reduced
NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at
30s interval. The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris-
HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 β-
mercapto-ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1
NAD+, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9
mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 µL. The reaction was
initiated by the addition of enzyme.
The specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was
calculated as:
(U mg-1) = {(∆ absorbance/∆ t) x volume of cell}/6.22 x
volume of enzyme x [ enzyme]
where ∆t = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; εNADH =
6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL;
[enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1.
T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity
The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction
medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 µL.
Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids
were tested at 50 and 100 µg mL-1 in 10% DMSO using
5 µL of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1.
In each case, a blank experiment was performed with
10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the
positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was
not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO.
Data were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent
of control were used as follows:
% inhibitory activity = {(U mg-1 control – U mg-1
compound)/U mg-1 control} x 100
Enzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in
the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São
Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.
Some of the potentially active substances, as flavones
6 and 8, can not be assayed with the standard procedure
described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction
buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used
to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these
limitations an alternative technique is being developed,
based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures
adopted with other enzymes.24
