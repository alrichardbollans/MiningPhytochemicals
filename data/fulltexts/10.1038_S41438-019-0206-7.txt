Abstract
Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) trees are woody perennials that bear colorful and nutritious fruits rich in phenolic
metabolites, e.g., hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) and flavonoids. We here report genome editing and gene discovery in
pomegranate hairy roots using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated
protein 9 (Cas9) (CRISPR/Cas9), coupled with transcriptome and biochemical analyses. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)
were designed to target two UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs), PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24, which
possess overlapping activities in β-glucogallin (a galloylglucose ester; biosynthetic precursor of HTs) biosynthesis. A
unique accumulation of gallic acid 3-O- and 4-O-glucosides (galloylglucose ethers) was observed in the PgUGT84A23
and PgUGT84A24 dual CRISPR/Cas9-edited lines (i.e., ugt84a23 ugt84a24) but not the control (empty vector) or
PgUGT84A23/PgUGT84A24 single edited lines (ugt84a23 or ugt84a24). Transcriptome and real-time qPCR analyses
identified 11 UGTs with increased expression in the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 hairy roots compared to the controls. Of the 11
candidate UGTs, only PgUGT72BD1 used gallic acid as substrate and produced a regiospecific product gallic acid
4-O-glucoside. This work demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 method can facilitate functional genomics studies in
pomegranate and shows promise for capitalizing on the metabolic potential of pomegranate for germplasm
improvement.
Introduction
The woody plant pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)
produces colorful flowers and fruits with ornamental and
culinary values. Different pomegranate tissues have his-
torically been used for alleviating symptoms or treating
various diseases due to the accumulation of a wide
diversity of bioactive metabolites1. In recent years,
pomegranate fruits and juice have been pursued by con-
sumers for their favorable nutritional quality, contributed
by the abundant phenolic compounds, e.g., hydrolyzable
tannins (HTs) and flavonoids, in these tissues and
products2. Genetic variations underlying different meta-
bolite profiles reportedly exist in pomegranate and have
been utilized for breeding cultivars with desirable traits3.
Complementary to the classic breeding approach, new
molecular techniques, such as genome editing, can enable
targeted modification of key metabolic genes for
improved nutritional and commercial quality of pome-
granate fruits and products.
Among the various genome-editing technologies,
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)
(CRISPR/Cas9) has gained increasing popularity for its
efficiency and ease of use. In this method, a single guide
RNA (sgRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to the target gene
sequence upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif. Cas9
creates a break in the double-strand DNA, which is then
ligated by homology-directed repair or non-homologous

end joining4. In general, five genotypes can be obtained
from the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in a
diploid species, including wild type (no mutations),
homozygous mutant (same mutations in both alleles),
heterozygous mutant/monoallelic (mutation in one allele,
wild type in the other allele), biallelic (different mutations
in the two alleles), and chimera (more than two different
mutations in the alleles)5. Initially used for disruption of
gene function, there has been rapid advancement in the
CRISPR/Cas9 technology for more precise (e.g., base
editing) and versatile (e.g., controlling gene expression)
genome editing6,7.
Although CRISPR/Cas9 has been successfully adopted
in many plant species (e.g., Arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato,
rice etc.), its application has not been reported in
pomegranate8. In consideration of the time and effort
required for transformation and regeneration of pome-
granate plants, we chose a hairy root system for testing
the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
genome editing in pomegranate. This is because hairy
roots can be induced from different pomegranate
explants, accumulate HTs and other phenolic com-
pounds, are transformable, and produce sufficient
amounts of tissues for molecular and metabolite analyses
within 3 months of transformation9.
To select an easily discernable phenotype for verifica-
tion of successful genome editing in pomegranate hairy
roots, we chose PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24, encod-
ing two UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) that
form β-glucogallin from gallic acid and UDP-glucose, as
target genes (Fig. 1a)10. Reduced accumulation of puni-
calagin α and β isomers (the most abundant HTs in
pomegranate; produced from β-glucogallin) was observed
in pomegranate hairy roots with attenuated PgUGT84A23
and PgUGT84A24 activities (via RNAi suppression of
PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 gene expression)10.
Therefore, the punicalagin levels in hairy roots can serve
as a metabolic phenotype for knocking out PgUGT84A23
and PgUGT84A24 activities through genome editing.
In this work, we generated pomegranate hairy root lines
containing CRISPR/Cas9-edited PgUGT84A23 and/or
PgUGT84A24. We also modified the expression plasmids
by incorporating a green fluorescent protein (GFP) mar-
ker for rapid and non-destructive screening of transgenic
hairy roots. Metabolite analysis was conducted on the
control (empty vector) as well as the single and dual
CRISPR/Cas9-edited hairy roots (i.e., ugt84a23, ugt84a24,
and ugt84a23 ugt84a24) and showed significant changes
in ugt84a23 ugt84a24. Comparative transcriptome ana-
lysis was subsequently carried out on the control and

cation of a new regioselective UGT toward gallic acid.
Results
The CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNAs effectively created mutations in
PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24
To knockout the activity of PgUGT84A23 or
PgUGT84A24, one sgRNA for PgUGT84A23 (sgRNA23)
and two sgRNAs for PgUGT84A24 (sgRNA24-1 and
sgRNA24-2) were designed, which are specific for each
target gene and away from the Plant Secondary Product
Glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motif conserved among plant
UGTs for binding sugar donors (Fig. 1b). To eliminate
both PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 activities,
sgRNA23 and sgRNA24-1/sgRNA24-2 were placed into
the same expression plasmid (Fig. 1c). A GFP selection
marker was incorporated in the plasmid for sgRNA and
Cas9 expression and used for screening of transgenic
hairy roots (Fig. 1c).
Two hundred pomegranate hairy roots were transformed
with each sgRNA or sgRNA combinations (i.e., sgRNA23,
sgRNA24-1, sgRNA24-2, sgRNA23+sgRNA24-1, or
sgRNA23+sgRNA24-2) and about 80% of the transfor-
mants exhibited green fluorescence emission upon exci-
tation. Multiple GFP-positive hairy roots derived from
each expression plasmid were randomly selected for
sequencing (Tables 1 and 2). Of the seven sgRNA23 hairy
root lines analyzed, there were two homozygous mutants

with a 1-bp deletion or a 74-bp deletion and five biallelic
mutants carrying deletions (or a deletion and a mismatch)
of different sizes (Table 1). For sgRNA24-1, one homo-
zygous mutant of a 1-bp deletion, one heterozygous
mutant with a 3-bp mismatch and a 13-bp deletion in one
allele, and six biallelic mutants were detected (Table 1).
For sgRNA24-2, one homozygous mutant of a combined
5-bp deletion and 1-bp mismatch and eight biallelic
mutants with deletions and/or insertions were identified
(Table 1).
For the 36 dual sgRNA lines (sgRNA23+sgRNA24-1/
sgRNA24-2) selected for sequencing, 23 were identified as
homozygous, biallelic, or chimeric mutants for
PgUGT84A24 and further examined for mutations in the
PgUGT84A23 alleles, 19 of which also showed homo-
zygous, biallelic, heterozygous, or chimeric mutations in
PgUGT84A23 (Table 2). Interesting variations of CRISPR/
Cas9 editing were observed in the dual sgRNA lines, e.g., a
long deletion of 1162-bp in a PgUGT84A24 allele in
sgRNA23+sgRNA24-1 (line 305) and both a 21-bp

Knockout of PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 led to
changes in galloylglucose conjugates and derivatives in
pomegranate hairy roots
To investigate the effect of the PgUGT84A23 and/or
PgUGT84A24 mutations, phenolic metabolites in the con-
trol and mutant (ugt84a23, ugt84a24, ugt84a23 ugt84a24)
hairy roots were analyzed (Fig. 2a). Eliminating
PgUGT84A23 or PgUGT84A24 individually did not affect
the metabolite profile significantly compared to the controls.
However, when both UGT activities were abolished, puni-
calagins showed a 40% reduction in ugt84a23 ugt84a24
(Fig. 2a, c). Moreover, three new peaks (peaks 1–3) appeared
in the dual CRISPR/Cas9-edited lines ugt84a23 ugt84a24
(Fig. 2a). The retention times and absorption spectra of
peaks 1 and 2 matched those of the gallic acid 3-O- and 4-
O-glucoside standards, respectively (Fig. 2a, b). Mass spec-
trometric (MS) analysis of peaks 1 and 2 confirmed that
both compounds are conjugates of gallic acid and glucose
([M-H]− at m/z 331.07) (Fig. 2b). In contrast to peaks 1 and
2 that were present in all of the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 lines,
peak 3 (Fig. 2a, b, unidentified) was only detectable in two-
thirds of the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 hairy roots.
A regiospecific gallic acid 4-O-glycosyltransferase was
discovered from transcriptome analysis of the CRISPR/
Cas9-edited hairy roots and biochemical characterization
To identify the UGT activities that produce gallic acid
glucosides in ugt84a23 ugt84a24, transcriptome analysis
was conducted on the control (three independent lines)
and the dual edited hairy roots (lines 324, 327, 328, and
346; Table 2). Twelve UGTs showed significantly
increased expression (greater than two-fold) in the
ugt84a23 ugt84a24 lines compared to the controls
(Table 3). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reac-
tion (qPCR) analysis confirmed that the transcript levels
of 11 UGTs were higher in the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 lines
than the controls (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the expression of
Pgr008782 was also increased in the single CRISPR/Cas9-
edited lines ugt84a23 and ugt84a24 (Fig. 3). These 11
candidate UGTs were expressed as recombinant proteins
in Escherichia coli and the purified proteins were assayed
with gallic acid and UDP-glucose as substrates. Of the 11
recombinant UGTs, only PgUGT72BD1 was active toward
(see figure on previous page)

gallic acid and formed a single product, gallic acid 4-O-
glucoside (Fig. 4a, c). The steady-state kinetics of
PgUGT72BD1 showed that it had a relatively high affinity
to gallic acid (Km= 0.19 ± 0.07 mM) but a slow turnover
[kcat= (2.83 ± 0.5) × 10
−3 s−1)] and low catalytic efficiency
[kcat/Km= (0.15 ± 0.03) × 10
−1 mM−1 s−1] (Fig. 4c).
As with other plant UGTs, PgUGT72BD1 also contains
a conserved PSPG motif at the C-terminus of the protein
(Fig. 4b). Signal peptides were not detected in
PgUGT72BD1, suggesting its localization in the cytosol
(Fig. 4b). A phylogenetic analysis of representative UGTs
placed PgUGT72BD1 in group E, together with
AtUGT71B1, AtUGT72B1, AtUGT71C1, and AtUGT71C4,
the UGTs that were previously shown with 3-O or 4-O-
glucosylation activities toward hydroxybenzoic acids (gallic
acid was not tested as a substrate for these UGTs) (Fig. 5)11.
When the protein sequences of PgUGT72BD1,
AtUGT71B1, AtUGT72B1, AtUGT71C1, and AtUGT71C4
were compared, six amino acid sites were identified that are
common among the 3-O (AtUGT72B1, AtUGT71C1, and
AtUGT71C4) or 4-O (PgUGT72BD1 and AtUGT71B1)
UGTs but differ between the two groups (Fig. 4b).
To understand the expression of PgUGT72BD1 in dif-
ferent pomegranate tissues, its transcript levels were
initially determined by real-time qPCR. However, with the
exception of roots (Ct values around 27), the Ct values
obtained from other tissues were >38, suggesting a very
low abundance of PgUGT72BD1 transcripts in stems,
leaves, flowers, and fruit peels. Semi-qPCR was subse-
quently conducted, and consistent with the results from
the real-time qPCR analysis, amplification products of
PgUGT72BD1 were only detected in the root tissue
(Fig. 4d). In contrast, PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24
were expressed in all tissues examined (Fig. 4d).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9-based
genome editing, A. rhizogenes-mediated hairy root trans-
formation and non-destructive screening of transgenic
hairy roots, as well as transcriptome analysis collectively
enable efficient and effective gene discovery in pome-
granate. The unique accumulation of gallic acid gluco-
sides in the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 hairy roots also suggests
that the CRISPR/Cas9 method holds the potential for
developing new pomegranate cultivars with modified
phytochemical profiles. The presence of gallic acid 3-O-
and 4-O-glucosides has only been reported in fruits of
blackcurrant, gooseberry, jostaberry, raspberry, black-
berry, blueberry, Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree), and
grape (pomace)12–14. Therefore, it is interesting that gallic
acid glucosides can also be found in a non-reproductive
plant tissue.
The CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNAs generated mismatches, in-
frame (3n, e.g., 3-bp, 6-bp), or out-of-frame (e.g., 1-bp, 4-
bp, 5-bp) deletions, as well as insertions of 1-bp, 2-bp, or
7-bp in PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 (Tables 1 and 2).
The above-mentioned insertions and the out-of-frame
deletions are expected to result in a frameshift and
incorrect translation of the protein. Because the mutant
lines containing in-frame deletions (removal of amino
acids) exhibited metabolic phenotypes similar to those
with insertions and out-of-frame deletions, it suggests
that the missing amino acids resulting from the in-frame
deletions play important roles in enzyme activities. In
addition to the homozygous, monoallelic, and biallelic
mutants, chimeras of more than two mutated alleles
were also identified in the CRISPR/Cas9-edited hairy
roots (Table 2). It could be because the hairy roots
induced at the inoculation sites contain heterogeneous

ugt84a24 hairy roots (appearance of new peaks) indi-
cates the advantage of metabolite profiling in detecting
knockout of enzyme activities in a heterogeneous cell
population.
Eliminating both PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24
activities frees gallic acid from the biosynthesis of
β-glucogallin (Fig. 1a). The transitory increase in the
cellular gallic acid concentration may regulate the
expression/activity of UGT(s) that convert gallic acid to
the glucoside derivatives (Fig. 1a). Indeed, gallic acid 3-O-
and 4-O-glucosides accumulated in the ugt84a23
ugt84a24 hairy roots (Fig. 2). In addition, transcriptome
and real-time qPCR analyses identified 11 UGTs with
increased expression in ugt84a23 ugt84a24 and one of the
candidate UGTs, PgUGT72BD1, exhibited regioselective
glucosylation of gallic acid at the 4-OH position (Table 3;
Figs. 3 and 4). However, none of the candidate UGTs
produced gallic acid 3-O-glucoside, suggesting that the
gallic acid 3-O-glucosylation activity may be regulated at a
level other than transcription.
PgUGT72BD1, PgUGT84A23, and PgUGT84A24 can all
use gallic acid as substrate but form galloylglucose con-
jugates with ether or ester linkages (Fig. 1a).
PgUGT72BD1 has a higher affinity to gallic acid (Km=
0.19 ± 0.07 mM; Fig. 4c) than PgUGT84A23 (Km= 0.89 ±
0.07 mM) and PgUGT84A24 (Km= 0.98 ± 0.01 mM)
10.
However, the turnover numbers of PgUGT84A23 (kcat=
0.52 ± 0.03 s−1) and PgUGT84A24 (kcat= 0.55 ± 0.01 s
−1)
are >180-fold higher than that of PgUGT72BD1 [kcat=
(2.83 ± 0.5) × 10−3 s−1]. As a result, the catalytic efficiency
of PgUGT72BD1 [kcat/Km= (0.15 ± 0.03) × 10
−1 mM−1 s−1]
is about 38-fold lower than that of PgUGT84A23 (kcat/Km=
0.58mM−1 s−1) and PgUGT84A24 (kcat/Km= 0.56mM
−1 s−1)
(Fig. 4c)10. Therefore, even though PgUGT72BD1 is
expressed in the wild-type pomegranate roots and hairy
roots, gallic acid is mainly used for the biosynthesis of
β-glucogallin (and HTs) by PgUGT84A23 and
PgUGT84A24 due to their much higher catalytic effi-
ciencies than PgUGT72BD1. Indeed, our previous meta-
bolite profiling analysis did not identify gallic acid 4-O-
glucoside in any pomegranate tissues10. These results also
suggest that the primary role of PgUGT72BD1 in pome-
granate roots could be glycosylating aglycones other than
gallic acid. Intriguingly, HT production was not com-
pletely abolished in ugt84a23 ugt84a24 (Fig. 2), suggesting
that there could be additional UGT(s) contributing to
β-glucogallin formation in pomegranate.
Of the 17 so far defined UGT phylogenetic groups
(A–Q) in plants, PgUGT72BD1 (gallic acid 4-O UGT)
belongs to group E that contains UGT71, UGT72, and
UGT88 gene families (Fig. 5). Regioselective glycosylation
of hydroxybenzoic acids (structurally similar to gallic acid)
was previously reported for members of group E UGTs,
including AtUGT71B1 that only glycosylates the 4-OH
position and AtUGT71C1, AtUGT71C4, and AtUGT72B1
that specifically glycosylate the 3-OH position11. Six
amino acids are conserved in the hydroxybenzoic acid/
gallic acid 3-O or 4-O UGTs but distinct between the two
groups of regioselective UGTs (Fig. 4b). The function of
these amino acids in determining the regioselectivity of
the corresponding UGTs can be explored by site-directed
mutagenesis and enzyme assays. In addition, once the
gallic acid 3-O UGT is cloned in pomegranate, the protein
sequences and structural features of the gallic acid 3-O
and 4-O UGTs can be compared to identify the key amino
acid(s) for regioselectivity. Furthermore, it was proposed
that the regioselectivity for hydroxycoumarins (a group of
phenolic metabolites) was switched among the UGT71,
UGT72, and UGT88 families during the evolution of
group E UGTs15. It will be interesting to understand
whether regioselectivity switching event(s) for gallic acid
also occurred among these UGT gene families.
Conclusions
In this work, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of two
galloylglucose ester-forming UGTs, PgUGT84A23 and
PgUGT84A24, in pomegranate hairy roots generated
various mismatches, insertions, and deletions in the tar-
get genes. Metabolite analysis of the transgenic hairy
roots showed modified phenolic profiles, particularly the
accumulation of 3-O- and 4-O-glucosides of gallic acid, in
the ugt84a23 ugt84a24 double mutant lines. Tran-
scriptome and real-time qPCR analyses identified multi-
ple UGTs with increased expression in the ugt84a23
ugt84a24 hairy roots compared to the vector-
transformed controls. Biochemical characterization of
the candidate genes discovered a group E UGT
(PgUGT72BD1) that glycosylates specifically the 4-O
position of gallic acid.
The pomegranate genome has recently been sequenced,
providing an exciting opportunity for exploring this
ancient fruit and modern functional food16,17. Together
with genome, transcriptome, and metabolite analyses, the
CRISPR/Cas9 method renders functional genomics in
pomegranate, a woody plant and non-traditional model
system, more accessible. In addition, building a genome-
editing platform in pomegranate will also facilitate
germplasm improvement as well as the sustainable
development of pomegranate as a horticultural crop and
functional food.
Materials and methods
Construction of expression plasmids for Cas9 and sgRNAs
The sgRNAs for PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 were
designed using Cas-Designer (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-
designer/)18; those with high-quality scores were then sub-
jected to testing for secondary structures using the mfold web
server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?=mfold/RNA-Folding-
Chang et al. Horticulture Research           (2019) 6:123 Page 11 of 15
Form2.3)19. The following sgRNAs were selected in this
study: sgRNA23 for PgUGT84A23 (5′-GGGTCAAGGG-
CACGTGAAC-3′) and two sgRNAs, sgRNA24-1 (5′-GG
GAGGAGCCGTCGCCTAT-3’) and sgRNA24-2 (5′-ATC
CCGTGGGTGTCTGACG-3′), for PgUGT84A24.
The sgRNAs were cloned into the psgR-Cas9-At back-
bone, which contains the AtU6 promoter for the expression
of the sgRNA as well as the AtUBQ1 promoter and ter-
minator for the expression of SpCas920. For easy identifi-
cation of transgenic hairy roots, the hygromycin B
resistance gene in the plant transformation vector
pCAMBIA1300 was replaced with a GFP gene and the
resulting plasmid vector was designated pCAMBIA1300-
GFP. The sgRNA and Cas9 containing psgR-Cas9-At cas-
sette was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of
pCAMBIA1300-GFP. Because a high-quality sgRNA tar-
geting both PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24 was not
identified, the sgRNAs for PgUGT84A23 and PgUGT84A24
were cloned into the p2xsgR-Cas9-At cassette (i.e.,
sgRNA23+sgRNA24-1 or sgRNA23+sgRNA24-2) where
the two sgRNAs were each directed by an AtU6 promoter.
The resulting cassettes were cloned into the EcoRI and
HindIII sites of pCAMBIA1300-GFP.
Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated induction and
transformation of pomegranate hairy roots
The sgRNA and Cas9-expressing pCAMBIA1300-GFP
plasmids and the empty pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector were
transformed into the A. rhizogenes strain MSU440
through electroporation. Induction and transformation of
pomegranate hairy roots using the hypocotyl explants
were carried out as described9. The hairy roots were
observed under a fluorescent microscope (Leica
DM6000B, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) after
21 days. Hairy roots that emitted green fluorescence upon
excitation were marked on the plate and the non-green
fluorescent hairy roots were removed using a scalpel. Only
one green fluorescent hairy root was maintained on each
plate. These hairy roots were transferred to plates con-
taining fresh growth media every 3 weeks. After about
2 months, the hairy root tissue was collected, frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and ground into fine powder using mortar
and pestle.
Detection of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing
To identify the CRISPR/Cas9-edited PgUGT84A23 and
PgUGT84A24 alleles, genomic DNA was extracted from
transgenic hairy roots using a Cetyltrimethyl Ammonium
Bromide-based method21. PCR reactions were performed
using the genomic DNA as template and PgUGT84A23F
(5′-GTTCGGAGTCGTCACTTGTC-3′) and PgUG-
T84A23R (5′-ATCTCGTGCTCAAGTTCCTG-3′) for
amplification of the PgUGT84A23 alleles and
PgUGT84A24F (5′-GGGGTCCGAGTCGTTGGTTC-3′)
and PgUGT84A24R (5′-GCACGGCAACTGGACATCG-
3′) for the PgUGT84A24 alleles. The PCR products were
analyzed directly by DNA sequencing. The DNA
sequence chromatograms of the homozygous wild-type or
mutant alleles showed individual, evenly distributed
peaks. When a mixture of different mutant alleles or a
combination of wild-type and mutant alleles was present
in the PCR products, the chromatograms displayed
overlapping peaks. In the latter case, the PCR products
were cloned into a TA cloning vector pMD19-T (Takara
Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The
resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α
cells and multiple colonies were selected for plasmid
preparation and DNA sequencing.
Metabolite analysis of transgenic hairy roots
The ground hairy root tissue was extracted in 70%
methanol for 60min under sonication and centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 10min. The supernatant was transferred
to an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
vial and 20 μL was injected onto an Agilent 1200 HPLC.
Metabolite separation was performed using a reverse-
phase C18 column (Diamonsil, 250 mm× 4.6 mm, particle
size 5 μm) and a previously established gradient22. Peaks
of interest were collected from multiple HPLC runs,
pooled, concentrated, and subjected to high-resolution
electrospray ionization MS analysis as described22. The
gallic acid, gallic acid 3-O-glucoside, and gallic acid 4-O-
glucoside standards were purchased from ZZBIO Co.
LTD (Shanghai, China). One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s honestly significant dif-
ference (HSD) post hoc test was conducted on the peak
areas of punicalagins (punicalagin α and β isomers) using
JMP 14.2.0 (SAS Institute, 2018).
Transcriptome analysis of transgenic hairy roots
Three vector-transformed and four ugt84a23 ugt84a24
hairy root lines (Table 2) were selected for comparative
transcriptome analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
hairy roots using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). RNAseq libraries were constructed using the Illu-
mina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit and subjected to
sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq4000, with about 60
million paired-end reads (2 × 150 bp) per sample. The raw
reads were cleaned to remove the adapter sequences as
well as short or low-quality sequences using SeqPrep
(https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) and Sickle (https://
github.com/najoshi/sickle). The trimmed reads were
mapped to the pomegranate genome using Hisat2 to
obtain read counts23. The read counts were quantified by
the RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization method and
expressed as transcripts per million reads24. The
Chang et al. Horticulture Research           (2019) 6:123 Page 12 of 15
differential gene expression analysis between the controls
and ugt84a23 ugt84a24 lines was performed using
DESeq2, with adjusted P value <0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ 1
25.
The transcriptome data were deposited in the NCBI
sequence reads archive under the accession
PRJNA550088.
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins and
UGT enzyme assays
The open reading frames of candidate UGTs were
codon optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized by
Genewiz (Suzhou, China), and cloned into the pET28a
vector. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into
E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the cells were grown at 37 °C in the
Luria Bertani media until OD600 reached 0.8. Protein
expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The
cells were grown at 17 °C for an additional 18 h and
harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resus-
pended in the lysis buffer (50 mM MES, pH 5.5, 300mM
NaCl, and 50mM imidazole) and homogenized using a
cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd, Northants, UK).
The His-tagged recombinant UGT proteins were purified
using Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). The concentration of the purified proteins was
measured using the Bradford assay26. The purified protein
was kept in the storage buffer [50 mM MES, pH 5.5,
100mM NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol] at −80 °C.
For UGT enzyme assays, the 160-μL reaction mixture
contained 50mM MES, pH 5.5, 0.6 mM UDP-glucose,
0.25 mM gallic acid, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.6 μg
of purified protein. After incubating at 30 °C for 12 h, the
reaction was terminated by adding 16 μL of trifluoroacetic
acid (100%, w/v) and 400 μL of methanol. The reaction
mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and 70 μL of
the flow-through was injected onto an Agilent 1200 HPLC
with a reverse-phase C18 column (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ
C18 L1, 250mm x 4.6 mm, particle size 5 μm). The elution
gradient was between (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and
(B) acetonitrile at 0–3min, 3% B; 3–5min, 3–5% B;
5–15min, 5–15% B; 15–16min, 15–60% B; and
16–18 min, 60–3% B. The flow rate was 1 mLmin−1. The
kinetic analysis of PgUGT72BD1 with gallic acid as sub-
strate was performed as previously described27, with slight
modifications. The gallic acid concentrations were
between 30 and 500 μM and the reactions were incubated
at 30 °C for 45, 75, and 135 min.
Reverse transcription (RT) (semi)-qPCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from transgenic hair roots or
pomegranate leaf, stem, root, flower, and fruit peel tissues
using the RNAprep Pure Plant Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China) and used for RT with the Prime-
Script™ RT Reagent Kit (Takara). qPCR was performed
using the TB Green® Premix Ex Taq™ (Tli RNaseH Plus)
Kit (Takara) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Melting curve analysis was
conducted immediately after the PCR reactions and only
one product was observed for each primer pair. The RT-
qPCR reactions were performed using three biological
replicates, each with three technical replicates. The
expression levels of candidate UGTs in the control and
mutant (ugt84a23, ugt84a24, ugt84a23 ugt84a24) samples
were presented using ΔCt values (Ct PgUGT−Ct PgActin).
Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and
Tukey’s HSD test in JMP 14.2.0 (SAS Institute). The
primer sequences, amplicon sizes, and amplification effi-
ciencies are shown in Table S1.
For the semi-qPCR analysis, 1 μL of the first-strand
cDNA was used as template for amplification by TaKaRa
Taq® DNA polymerase (Takara) and primers specific for
PgUGT72BD1, PgUGT84A23, PgUGT84A24, or PgActin
(Table S1). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for
5 min, followed by 25 cycles (PgActin, PgUGT84A23,
PgUGT84A24) or 30 cycles (PgUGT72BD1) of 94 °C for
30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension
step of 72 °C for 10min. The PCR products were analyzed
on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of plant UGT sequences was conducted using
Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation
(MUSCLE)28. A neighbor-joining tree was built using
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis and assessed with
1000 bootstrap replicates29. The AGI (Arabidopsis sequen-
ces) and GenBank (non-Arabidopsis sequences) accession
numbers for the UGTs are: AcUGT73G1 (AAP88406),
