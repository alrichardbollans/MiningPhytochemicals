SYNOPSIS
The evolution of natural products biosynthetic pathways can be envisioned to occur via a number
of mechanisms. Here we provide evidence that latent plasticity plays a role in such metabolic
evolution. In particular, rice (Oryza sativa) produces both ent- and syn-copalyl diphosphate (CPP),
which are substrates for downstream diterpene synthases. Here we report that several members of
this enzymatic family exhibit dual reactivity with some pairing of ent-, syn-, or normal CPP
stereochemistry. Evident plasticity was observed, as a previously reported ent-
sandaracopimaradiene synthase also converts syn-CPP to syn-labda-8(17),12E,14-triene, which
can be found in planta. Notably, normal CPP is not naturally found in rice. Thus, the presence of
diterpene synthases that react with this non-native metabolite reveals latent enzymatic/metabolic
plasticity, providing biochemical capacity for utilization of such a novel substrate (i.e., normal
CPP) that may arise during evolution, the implications of which are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Terpenoids, with over 40,000 known individual compounds, form the largest class of natural
products [1]. Prominent among these are the ~7,000 labdane-related diterpenoids, which are
particularly prevalent in plants, where the affiliated gibberellin phytohormone production
required for normal growth and development provides a genetic reservoir that has been
repeatedly drawn upon for the evolution of novel such natural products [2, 3]. The unifying
biogenetic feature of labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthesis is its initiation by a sequential
pair of cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions, and the corresponding enzymes are often
found as functionally diverse gene families in plants [4, 5]. The characteristic decalin ring
structure is formed from the universal diterpenoid precursor (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl
diphosphate (GGPP) by initially acting class II diterpene cyclases, which most commonly
produce a labdadienyl/copalyl diphosphate (CPP) of normal (9S,10S), syn (9S,10R), or ent
(9R,10R) configuration (Scheme 1), with the corresponding enzymes termed CPP synthases
(CPS). The resulting CPP is subsequently utilized by class I diterpene synthases, which lyse
the allylic diphosphate ester linkage to initiate carbocationic cyclization and/or

rearrangement reactions. Because the corresponding enzyme in gibberellin biosynthesis is
ent-kaurene synthase (KS), the derived class I diterpene synthases are often termed KS-like
(KSL). However, while these enzymes do not react with GGPP and are typically assumed to
be specific for particular stereoisomers of CPP, comprehensive investigation of such
substrate stereospecificity (e.g., with all three commonly found CPP stereoisomers) has not
been reported.
Rice (Oryza sativa) has become a model system for investigation of labdane-related
diterpenoid biosynthesis, as it has long been appreciated that it produces at least 20 such
natural products as antimicrobial phytoalexins, and relatively early sequencing of the rice
genome has led to functional characterization of the corresponding diterpene synthase gene
families [4, 6]. However, since rice produces only ent- and syn-CPP, as first suggested by
substrate studies with cell-free enzyme assays [7, 8], and then more conclusively
demonstrated by functional genomics based investigations of the rice CPS family [9-11], the
rice KSL (OsKSL) were only assayed with these two stereoisomers [12-18]. This OsKSL
family, with eight functional members (Scheme 2), provided an opportunity to
comprehensively explore diterpene synthase substrate stereospecificity not only for
individual enzymes, but also across an entire organism/genome, providing insight into the
encoded metabolic plasticity. Accordingly, we have utilized our modular metabolic
engineering system [19], to investigate the CPP substrate stereospecificity of the OsKSL
family. The results of this substrate specificity screen revealed not only evident, but also
latent metabolic plasticity, as well as offering some insight into diterpene synthase substrate
recognition, all of which are discussed below.
EXPERIMENTAL
General
Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough,
Leicestershire, UK), and molecular biology reagents from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
All recombinant expression was carried out using the OverExpress C41 strain of E. coli
(Lucigen, Middleton, WI), which is well suited to T7 promoter based expression of plant
derived labdane-related diterpene synthases [20]. GC-MS was performed with a Varian
(Palo Alto, CA) 3900 GC with Saturn 2100 ion trap mass spectrometer in electron ionization
(70 eV) mode using a HP-5ms column. Samples (1 μL) were injected in splitless mode at 50
°C and, after holding for 3 min. at 50 °C, the oven temperature (unless otherwise noted) was
raised at a rate of 14 °C/min. to 300 °C, where it was held for an additional 3 min. MS data
from 90 to 600 m/z were collected starting 12 min. after injection until the end of the run.
Functional characterization via metabolic engineering
Functional characterization of the substrate stereospecificity of the OsKLS was
accomplished by use of our previously described modular metabolic engineering system
[19]. Briefly, using this system it possible to co-express class I labdane-related diterpene
synthases such as the OsKSL from pET based pDEST expression vectors with GGPP and
CPP synthases carried on a compatible pACYC-Duet (Novagen/EMD) derived plasmid,
where pGGnC carries the D621A mutant of abietadiene synthase from Abies grandis that
produces CPP of normal stereochemistry [21], while pGGeC carries the An2/ZmCPS2 ent-
CPP synthase from Zea mays [22], and pGGsC carries the OsCPS4 syn-CPP synthase from
rice [10]. Accordingly, C41 cells were transformed with the appropriate plasmid enabling
functional recombinant expression of each OsKSL, as previously described [18], along with
one of the three pGGxC vectors described above, in all possible pairings. These recombinant
bacteria were then grown in 20-mL liquid media cultures with shaking at 37 °C to A600 ~
1.0, then shifted to 16 °C for 1 hr prior to induction with 0.5 mM IPTG, with the cultures

then fermented for an additional 72 hrs at 16 °C with continued shaking. The cultures were
then extracted with an equal volume of hexane, with 1:50 (v/v) ethanol added to disrupt
emulsions. Diterpene production was quantified by GC-FID analysis, with GC-MS
comparison to authentic standards enabling identification of all resulting compounds but that
from co-expression of OsKSL10 with pGGsC (i.e., syn-CPP).
To directly determine the structure of the OsKSL10 product from syn-CPP, we utilized
previously described methodology to improve production levels in our metabolic
engineering system [23], which enabled facile generation of the milligram quantities needed
for structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy. Specifically, we co-transformed
pDEST15/OsKSL10 and pGGsC with the further co-compatible pIRS plasmid that increases
flux into the endogenous methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway by overexpression of
the idi, dxs, and dxr genes from E. coli. The resulting recombinant bacteria were grown and
extracted as described above, but as a 1-L culture supplemented with the MEP pathway
precursors pyruvate (50 mM) and 2% (v/v) glycerol. The resulting 1-L of hexane extract was
reduced to ~10-mL by rotary evaporation, passed over a ~5-mL silica gel column to remove
any polar contaminants, and then dried under nitrogen gas, yielding ~5 mg of the unknown
diterpene, which was then re-dissolved in 0.4 mL CDCl3 for NMR analysis.
Chemical structure identification
NMR spectra for the unknown syn-CPP fed OsKSL10 product were recorded at 25 °C on a
Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe for 1H and 13C.
Structural analysis was performed using 1D 1H, 1D, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMQC, HMBC
and NOESY experiment spectra acquired at 500 MHz and 13C and DEPT135 spectra (125.5
MHz) using standard experiments from the Bruker TopSpin v1.3 software. Chemical shifts
were referenced to the known chloroform-d (13C 77.23, 1H 7.24 ppm) signals offset from
TMS. Correlations from the HMBC spectra were used to propose a partial structure, while
connections between protonated carbons were obtained from DQF-COSY to complete the
partial structure and assign proton chemical shifts. The configuration of the A and B rings is
predetermined by the configuration of the CPP enzyme substrate, since chemical bonds in
that portion of the molecule are not altered. The configuration of the acyclic portion of the
molecule (C11-C16) was determined by reference to spectra for normal labdatrienes, which
has been previously characterized [24]. Specifically, the C12-C13 double bond
configuration was determined to be E based on the C14 13C chemical shift for syn-
labda-8(17),12E,14-triene (142.01ppm). The comparison of E and Z configuration of normal
labda-8(17),12,14-trienes shows a dramatic ~10 ppm difference in the C14 chemical shift in
E versus Z configurations (~131 ppm (Z) vs. ~141 (E) ppm). This reference data and our
NMR analysis support the presented syn-labda-8(17),12E,14-triene double bond
configuration for the OsKSL10 product. The assignments for the annotated 13C and 1H 1-D
spectra are presented in Table 1.
Enzymatic assays
Assays were performed with purified GST-OsKSL10 fusion protein using enzymatic
coupling, as previously described [25, 26]. Briefly, GGPP was completely converted to
either ent- or syn- CPP by incubation with the appropriate CPS for 5 hrs at RT. Assays were
performed in duplicate with varying concentrations of GGPP ranging from 0.1 μM to 100
μM, with time and GST-OsKSL10 concentration varied to ensure measurements were taken
in the linear portion of the reaction progress curve. The assays were inactivated by heating
the solution to 65 °C for 5 min, with the remaining substrate then dephosphorylated by
treatment with phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolabs), enabling extraction of both the
diterpene product and copalol (derived from dephosporylation of CPP). This was done to
enable correction for handling errors by measurement of the fractional turnover (i.e.,

comparison of the relative amounts of diterpene product and copalol by GC-FID), which
was used in combination with the known starting concentration of substrate to calculate the
corresponding catalytic rate.
Extraction of Rice Leaves
Rice leaves that had been treated with methyl jasmonate for 36 hours, as previously
described [10], were frozen at −80 °C. Approximately 100 g of these frozen leaves were cut
up and then homogenized by grinding in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen in the
presence of glass beads. After grinding, the resulting powder was extracted with 75 mL of
hexanes, then 75 mL of ethyl acetate, and finally 75 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The combined
organic extracts were reduced by rotary evaporation, passed over silica gel, and dried under
N2 as above. The resulting material was then resuspended in 1 mL of ethyl acetate, with 20
μL aliquots being removed and then dried under N2, and resuspended in 20 μl hexane for
analysis by GC-MS, using an extended temperature ramp wherein, after the initial 3 min.
hold at the 50 °C injection temperature, the oven temperature was raised at 18 °C/min. to
190 °C, then slowed to 2.5 °C/min until reaching 275 °C, following which it was raised at 20
°C/min. to 300 °C, where it was held for 2 min.
RESULTS
Screening OsKSL substrate specificity
To investigate the substrate stereospecificity of the entire OsKSL family, we turned to our
previously developed modular metabolic engineering system [19]. In particular, using this
system it was possible to co-express each of the OsKSL with a GGPP synthase and CPS
producing one of the three commonly found stereoisomers of CPP (note that all the OsKSL
have been demonstrated to not react with the acyclic GGPP precursor). Accordingly, the
ability of each of the eight active OsKSL to react with CPP of ent-, syn-, or normal
stereochemistry was determined by simply extracting the corresponding recombinant
bacterial cultures and analyzing the resulting organic extract for the presence of diterpenes
by GC-MS. The previously reported activity for each of the OsKSL, as summarized in
Scheme 2, was evident. In addition, while the other OsKSL were specific for a single
stereoisomer of CPP, OsKSL4 and OsKSL11 reacted with CPP of normal stereochemistry
along with their previously reported activity with syn-CPP, and OsKSL10 was active with
syn-CPP as well as its previously reported activity with ent-CPP. Surprised by this latter
result, we purified OsKSL10 and verified its reactivity with syn-CPP, with the same product
resulting from in vitro reactions as found in the context of the bacterial metabolic
engineering system. In all three cases, diterpene yield with the “alternative” CPP
stereoisomer approached that found with the “native” stereoisomer, being limited to less
than three-fold decreases. As yield in our metabolic engineering system has been correlated
with catalytic efficiency [25, 26], this suggests that these enzymes exhibit reasonable
affinity for and activity with their “alternative” substrates.
Alternative substrate product identification
By comparison with available authentic standards, OsKSL4 activity with CPP of normal
stereochemistry was found to produce a mixture of ~90% pimara-8(14),15-diene and ~10%
isopimara-7,15-diene, while OsKSL11 reacted with the same substrate to yield essentially
only isopimara-8(14),15-diene (also known as sandaracopimaradiene; Figure 1). However, it
was not possible to identify the product of OsKSL10 activity with syn-CPP in this fashion,
as it did not match any authentic standard on-hand. This diterpene was then identified by
increasing flux towards terpenoid production, via up-regulation of the endogenous
isoprenoid precursor supply pathway as previously described [23], to enable the
corresponding recombinant bacteria to produce enough of the novel product for NMR

analysis (~5 mg, following purification, from 1 L of bacterial culture). The structure was
assigned by analysis of collected HMBC, HSQC, and COSY spectra, and found to be syn-
labda-8(17),12E,14-triene (Table 1), completing assignment of the observed alternative
reactions (Scheme 3).
Physiological relevance of syn-labdatriene
Because rice produces both ent- and syn-CPP, it seemed possible that the dual substrate
reactivity of OsKSL10 was physiologically relevant (i.e., both products can be found in
planta). The labdane-related diterpenoid natural products of rice are largely thought to be
anti-microbial phytoalexins [4, 6], whose biosynthesis, by definition [27], is induced as part
of the plant microbial defense response. This includes transcriptional up-regulation of
OsKSL10, as well as OsKSL4 [14]. Accordingly, the possibility that OsKSL10 produces
syn-labdatriene in planta was examined by phytochemical analysis of methyl jasmonate
induced and uninduced rice leaves. As previously reported [7], extracts from control
(uninduced) rice leaves contained only small amounts of ent-kaurene, while numerous
diterpenes were detected in extracts from induced rice leaves (Figure 2). These specifically
included syn-labdatriene, as well as syn-stemodene, whose presence in planta had not been
previously demonstrated, although the responsible OsKSL11 seems widely conserved [17].
Steady-state kinetic analysis also was consistent with physiological relevance of the ability
of OsKSL10 to react with both ent- and syn-CPP, as it exhibited similar catalytic efficiency
with each (Table 2). Notably, consistent with the lack of a normal CPP producing CPS in the
rice genome, while the syn-CPP derived products of OsKSL11 (as noted above), as well as
OsKSL4, were readily observed, the pimaradienes produced by these diterpene synthases
from normal CPP were not evident.
DISCUSSION
Based on the available genome sequence [28], the entire family of rice diterpene synthases is
known, and subsequent biochemical characterization has assigned unique functional roles to
each of these [15, 18]. Hence, it is possible to define this early part of the labdane-related
diterpene metabolic network for this important crop plant (Scheme 2), with the resulting/
downstream natural products largely thought to be involved in the microbial defense
response of the plant [4, 6]. One outcome of the studies reported here is the addition of the
syn-labdatriene product of OsKSL10 to this metabolic network. Given the inducible nature
of the transcription of OsKSL10 [14], and the role of its already known ent-
sandaracopimaradiene product as a precursor for the antifungal phytoalexins oryzalexins A –
F, it seems likely that any syn-labdatriene derived natural products will similarly function as
antifungal agents, although this remains to be demonstrated. This would be consistent with
similar transcriptional induction of all the other diterpene synthases involved in biosynthesis
of the >20 known rice diterpenoid phytoalexins [4, 6, 9-16]. Nevertheless, one intriguing
alternative possibility is a role for syn-labdatriene in production of an inducible signaling
molecule, as has been previously indicated for a similar labdatriene-derived diterpenoid in
tobacco [29]. On the other hand, the ability of OsKSL4 and OsKSL11 to react with normal
CPP is not directly relevant in rice, whose genome does not contain a CPS that produces this
stereoisomer [9-11].
In any case, the ability of certain rice diterpene synthases to react with two different
stereoisomers of CPP raises the question of how such dual substrate recognition is achieved.
OsKSL4 and OsKSL11 react with both syn- and normal CPP, and the obvious structural
similarity between these two stereoisomers is the occurrence of co-axial β-methyl
substituents on C4 and C10, which provides steric bulk on this “upper face” of the trans-
decalin nucleus (Figure 3). Presumably, it is this common feature that enables the dual
reactivity exhibited by OsKSL4 and OsKSL11. In addition, the stereochemistry of the

observed products is consistent with similar conformations of both substrates in each active
site (Figure 4). By contrast, the ability of OsKSL10 to react with both ent- and syn-CPP
presumably arises from the common C9α connection of the isoprenyl diphosphate
containing “tail” to the substrate nucleus (Figure 3), although the lack of cyclization with
syn-CPP prevents any insights into relative conformation of the two substrates within the
active site.
Notably, some plasticity in substrate specificity has been previously observed in other
terpene synthases, leading to suggestions of evolutionary relevance. Perhaps most strikingly,
work in strawberries has demonstrated a clear evolutionary derivation of a linalool/nerolidol
synthase in cultivated strawberry from monoterpene synthases found in wild strawberry
plants, wherein the loss of the plastid targeting pre-sequence from a presumably plastic
monoterpene synthase ancestor gave rise to this novel sesqui-/mono-terpene synthase [30].
Similar mono-/sesqui-terpene synthase plasticity has been uncovered in other cases as well
[31].
The ability of OsKSL4 and OsKSL11 to react with normal CPP demonstrates the presence
of latent diterpene metabolic plasticity in rice. Given the production of normal CPP by a
diverse array of plants, ranging from gymnosperms to angiosperms, with no obvious
homology between the relevant known enzymes from these two broad groups [5, 32-34], it
seems likely that neofunctionalization of the corresponding class II diterpene cyclases to
production of this CPP stereoisomer occurs with some appreciable frequency. Indeed, recent
results demonstrate that the closely related monocot cereal crop plant wheat (Triticum
aestivum) produces normal rather than syn-CPP (Y. Wu, T. Toyomasu, & R.J.P.; manuscript
in preparation). Accordingly, the latent metabolic plasticity evident here from the substrate
promiscuity of these two rice diterpene synthases provides a means by which such
emergence of stereochemically differentiated substrates could be immediately incorporated
into ‘secondary’ metabolism, which seems pertinent to such biochemical evolution in the
cereal plant family. In particular, coupled with the often-observed substrate plasticity of
downstream tailoring enzymes, especially cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases (CYP), this
would then enable emergence of essentially complete biosynthetic pathways (e.g., the
bioactive oryzalexins D – F are simply diterpenoid diols only two hydroxylations reactions
removed from their diterpene precursor). For example, rice contains ~350 CYP [35], with
the large CYP71 and CYP76 families (74 and 28 members, respectively) each containing
members involved in labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthesis [36, 37]. Notably, at least one
of these can hydroxylate pimaradienes of normal stereochemistry [38]. Thus, provided
access to a novel metabolite substrate the latent plasticity of terpene synthases, such as that
shown here, can immediately give rise to potentially bioactive natural products, providing a
mechanism for rapid evolution of novel biosynthetic pathways. While not directly selectable
in and of itself, such latent plasticity would be periodically uncovered upon the introduction
of novel metabolites, presumably providing a corresponding selectable advantage, albeit in
punctuate fashion.
