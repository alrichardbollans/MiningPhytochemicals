Os alcalóides isolados mostraram atividadeantifúngica contra Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, o fungo simbionte de formigas cortadeiras (Attaspp). Quando testados in vitro contra formas tripomastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi, os alcalóidesforam inativos ou parcialmente ativos. Neste trabalho descrevem-se o isolamento dos alcalóides,a elucidação estrutural dos alcalóides quinolônicos e a estrutura obtida por difração de raio-X daflindersiamina, juntamente com os resultados dos bioensaios realizados.Phytochemical survey of stems and leaves extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plantRaulinoa echinata Cowan, Rutaceae, led to the isolation of known furoquinoline alkaloids: thewidespread skimmianine; kokusaginine, maculine, flindersiamine, and also quinolone derivatives:1-methyl-2-n-nonyl-4-quinolone, 2-n-nonyl-4-quinolone and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone.These alkaloids showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus; the symbioticfungus of leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens). They were inactive or displayed weak inhibitory activitywhen assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. In this paper, theisolation, structure elucidation and bioactivity results of these compounds are reported togetherwith the X-ray structure of flindersiamine.Keywords: Raulinoa echinata, furoquinoline and quinolone alkaloids, antifungal,Trypanosoma cruzi, X-ray structure determination67Biological Activity of Quinoline Alkaloids from Raulinoa echinataVol. 13, No. 1, 2002of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Theircontrol can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of theirsymbiotic fungus.Trypanocidal compounds are important for the treatmentof Chagas´ disease which is responsible for a considerablenumber of deaths in Central and South American countries.In this paper we describe the isolation, structuraldetermination and evaluation of the activity offuroquinoline alkaloids as inhibitors of the growth of thesymbiotic fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus of leaf-cutting ants. The alkaloids were also assayed in vitro againsttrypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi.ExperimentalGeneral experimental proceduresNMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer,operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13Cwas used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS asinternal standard. For GC-MS analysis was used aShimadzu GC-17 A gas chromatograph fitted with a fusedsilica DB-1 (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm film thickness)capillary column, with helium as the carrier gas at a flowrate of 2.6 mL.min-1. The temperature was programmedinitially at 70 °C for 1 min, then increased with a rate of10 °C.min-1 to 280 °C and kept for 15 min. The injectionvolume was 1 µL in a split mode and temperatures of thedetector/injector were 300 °C/280 °C respectively. Thechromatograph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 massselective detector at 70 eV with scans from 50 to 500 amu.X-ray crystallographic data were recorded on an Enraf-Nonuis CAD-4 diffractometer using graphitemonochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and ω/2θscan mode at room temperature (291 K). During datacollection, the intensity of three standard reflections weremonitored every 30 min of X-ray exposure time showingno significant decay. Direct Methods solved the structure. Hatoms were placed in calculated positions with fixed C-Hdistances (0.93 Å for Csp2 and 0.96 Å for Csp3), each ridingon a carrier atom with isotropic displacement parametersamounting to 1.5 (for methyl H atoms) or 1.2 (for the other Hatoms) times the value of the equivalent isotropicdisplacement parameter of the carrier atom. The CAD-4Software3 was used for data collection; cell refinement wasdone on 25 centred reflections (10.23<θ<18.11o),3 datareduction: XCAD4,4 program used to solve the structure:SIR92;5 program used to refine structure: SHELXL97;6software used to prepare material for publication anddeposition: SHELXL97,6 PARST957 and WinGX.8Plant materialStems and leaves of R. echinata were collected inRessacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis(Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani(Universidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis &M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited in the HerbárioBarbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil.Extraction and isolation of compoundsThe dried and powdered stems (5 kg) and leaves (3 kg)were extracted with hexane and MeOH. Successively, halfpart (100.00 g) of the MeOH stems extract was fractionatedover silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions:CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The methanol fraction (89 g)was dissolved in H2O-MeOH (3:7) and successivelypartitioned using solvents of increasing polarity (hexane,CH2Cl2 and EtOAc), affording the correspondent subfractions. The CH2Cl2 sub fraction (2 g) waschromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using aseluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (9:1 and gradient) to furnish thecompounds (in eluting order): maculine (3) (36 mg),flindersiamine (4) (32 mg), kokusaginine (2) (42 mg),skimmianine (1) (29 mg), and the alkaloid 7 (10 mg).The MeOH leaves extract (100 g) was also submitted toliquid partition with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH.Column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, hexane-acetone 7:3) of the leaves hexane fraction (10 g) yieldedcompounds 5 (600 mg) and 6 (300 mg). All the furoquinolinealkaloids described above (except flindersiamine) were alsofound in the leaves extract in considerable amounts.Identification of the isolated compoundsThe isolated alkaloids skimmianine9 (1), kokusaginine10(2), maculine9 (3), and flindersiamine11 (4) presentedspectral data in agreement with the literature.Flindersiamine (4) Yellow needles, mp 206-208o.Crystallographic data: publication no.

In an attempt to confirm theextra methoxy group position on the furoquinolinenucleus, nOe experiments were performed. According tothese experiments, by irradiation on the C4 methoxy grouponly the furan H3 signal was enhanced. Also, when thesinglet corresponding to the quinoline hydrogen wasirradiated, no enhancement was observed for the methoxygroup as expected. These questionable irradiation resultsof 4 were verified by HMBC experiments. Unexpectedly,the C4 methoxy group showed correlation with thequinoline hydrogen. In order to solve these unclearfindings, an X-ray analysis (Figure 1) was performed toconfirm the C8 methoxy group position.The molecule is planar except for C11, in fact the rmsdeviation for 16 non-H atoms fitted to the best least squaresplane through them is of 0.026 and C11 being 1.069(3) Åout of that plane. A net of hydrogen bonds as shown inTable 3 joins the molecules in the crystal.Special attention should be given to a C-H...πinteraction and following Zukerman-Schpector et al.17 thisFigure 1.

(symmetry operation: i = 1-x, -0.5+y, 1.5-z).Whether all the cited interactions are true hydrogenbonds is difficult to assert, because as pointed out byCotton et al.,18 “..the field is getting muddier and muddieras the definition of a hydrogen bond is relaxed.” In anycase they are worth to be taken into account.The crystallographic data obtained for the alkaloid 4confirmed the previous HMBC spectroscopic attributions,but not the results obtained by nOe experiments.The structures of compounds 5, 6 and 7 were elucidatedon the basis of 1H NMR and EIMS spectra and carbonattributions were made by HMBC and HSQC correlationspectra. Data are presented on Table 2.Crude extracts of leaves and stems as well as fractionsof R. echinata showed good inhibitory activity on L.gongylophorus growth. Among the isolated compounds ofthese fractions, each of the alkaloids 1-5 maintained orshowed higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 100 mg mL-1(Table 1), compared with the original extracts. Contrary tothe expectations, at a 50 µg mL-1 dose the inhibitory effectwas quite strongly reduced. In general, furoquinolinealkaloids showed higher activity than quinolones. Probably,the activity demonstrated by the methanol extract of leaves(fraction hexane) is due to the high concentration of totalalkaloids, both furoquinoline and quinolone derivatives.Only the quinolinone alkaloids 5 and 6 displayed somemoderate activity on trypomastigote forms (Y strain) of T.cruzi with IC50 of 134.9 and 100.9 µg mL-1 respectively.Fungicidal activities have been described for thesealkaloids against plant pathogens Cladosporiumcucumerinum19 and Phytophthora spp.20 4-Quinolonescontaining long alkyl chains at C-2 were first obtained frommicroorganisms (from Pseudomonas, also called pseudans21)and have been also isolated from rutaceous genera, mainlyEvodia,22 Boronia,23 Ruta13 and Esenbeckia.24 Species fromthe former genus are used in Chinese herbal medicine andthe isolated alkaloids have demonstrated inhibitory activityagainst the bacteria Helicobacter pilori.25,26Furoquinoline alkaloids have also demonstrated in vitroactivity against Leishmania spp and Plasmodiumfalciparum.27,28AcknowledgementsWe wish to thank Prof. A.
