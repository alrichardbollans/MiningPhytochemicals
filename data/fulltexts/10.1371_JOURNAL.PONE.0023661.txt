Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of erythrocarpine E (CEB4), a limonoid extracted
from Chisocheton erythrocarpus on human oral squamous cell carcinoma. Based on preliminary dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-
diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, CEB4 treated HSC-4 cells demonstrated a cytotoxic effect and inhibited cell
proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner with an IC50 value of 4.061.9 mM within 24 h of treatment. CEB4 was
also found to have minimal cytotoxic effects on the normal cell line, NHBE with cell viability levels maintained above 80%
upon treatment. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and DNA
fragmentation assay results showed that CEB4 induces apoptosis mediated cell death. Western blotting results
demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis by CEB4 appeared to be mediated through regulation of the p53 signalling
pathway as there was an increase in p53 phosphorylation levels. CEB4 was also found to up-regulate the pro-apoptotic
protein, Bax, while down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway. Reduced levels of initiator procaspase-9 and executioner caspase-3 zymogen were also observed
following CEB4 exposure, hence indicating the involvement of cytochrome c mediated apoptosis. These results
demonstrate the cytotoxic and apoptotic ability of erythrocarpine E, and suggest its potential development as a cancer
chemopreventive agent.

Introduction
Various natural phytocompounds have been screened and
investigated extensively as potential anti-cancer agents. Approx-
imately 74% of drugs that were approved for cancer treatment
have been extracted from natural sources, either created by
structural modification or synthesized and designed based on
natural compounds as a model [1]. Most of natural anti-cancer
agents available to date are derived from plants, animals, marine
organisms and microorganisms. Some currently used examples of
plant-derived compounds with potential anti-cancer activities are
19S-19acetoxyeugenol acetate and 19S-19-acetoxychavicol acetate
[2], vincristine, irinotecan, etoposide and paclitaxel, while
bleomycin and doxorubicin are microbial-derived compounds,
and citarabine, derived from marine sources [3].
A subgroup of natural compounds known as limonoids, are
highly oxygenated tetracyclic triterpene derivatives and have been
recognized to possess interesting biological activities. To date,
many limonoids have been isolated with a wide range of biological
implications including insect anti-feedant, growth inhibiting
characteristics and anti-inflammatory agents [4]. Several citrus
limonoid aglycones such as limonin, nomilin, obacunone,
isoobacunoic acid and ichangin have recently been subjected to
anti-cancer screening procedures, and were found to induce
significant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and quinine reductase
(QR) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa of mice and rats
respectively [5–6]. Other reports include indications that mixtures
of limonoid aglycones with limonoid glucosides were equipotent to
tamoxifen for inhibiting the proliferation of ER positive breast
cancer cells, and an even higher potency against estrogen-
independent breast cancer cells [7]. Limonoids from the ethanolic
extract of Azadirachta indica (neem bark, leaves and seed oil) were
also found to cause cell death of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) by
inducing apoptosis through a reduction in Bcl-2 expression levels
corresponding with an increase in Bax levels [8].
Currently, the process of apoptosis and its relevance in cancer as
the preferred mode of death due to the effective clearance of
apoptotic cells without triggering inflammation has become one of
the priority fields in cancer research [9]. Recent studies conducted
on limonoids extracted from Citrus aurantifolia showed that the
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23661occurrence of apoptosis was mediated through the induction of
caspase-3, driven by the intrinsic pathway and the release of
cytochrome-c in human pancreatic cancer cells [10]. The natural
limonoid, erythrocarpine E (CEB4) which was utilized in this
study, is an A, B, D-seco heptacyclic limonoid with a cinnamoyl
group as the side chain at C-3 extracted from the bark of
Chisocheton erythrocarpus Hiern from the Meliaceae family, com-
monly known as ‘Rongga’ in Malaysia. It has recently been
demonstrated that CEB4 induces cytotoxic activity against P-388
murine leukemia cells at IC50 of 16.0 mg/ml [11]. In this study,
CEB4 was investigated for its potential to induce apoptosis in
HSC-4 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Materials and Methods
Plant material
Chisocheton erythrocarpus Hiern was collected from Hutan Simpan
Terenas, Kedah, Malaysia. The sample was identified by Mr.
Teoh Leng Eng from the Dept. of Chemistry, Faculty of Science,
University of Malaya. A voucher specimen (KL 4863) was
deposited in the Department of Chemistry Herbarium, University
of Malaya.
Reagents
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Roswell
Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640) with 4.5 g glucose/L,
300 mg/l L-glutamine, 2.5% (v/v) trypsin in modified Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium or magnesium, fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and all antibiotics were purchased from Lonza
Inc., USA. Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bro-
mide (MTT) reagent, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
apoptosis detection kit, propidium iodide (PI), RNase and
SuicideTrack
TM DNA Ladder Isolation kit were purchased from
Calbiochem (CA, USA).
Extraction and Isolation Natural Compound
Dried ground bark (1.3 kg) of Chisocheton erythrocarpus were
extracted successively with hexane, dichloromethane and metha-
nol. Each extract was then dried in vacuo. The dried dichloro-
methane extract (4.0 g) was subjected to fractionation by silica gel
column chromatography using a solvent mixture of hexane-ethyl
acetate. The polarity of the mobile phase was increased gradually
to 100% ethyl acetate. The fraction eluted from 30% of ethyl
acetate, which contained the target compound, was separated by
preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) with hexane-ethyl
acetate (7:3) to yield erythrocarpine E (4.7 mg).
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
A set of five human tumor cell lines were used in this study,
comprising HSC-4, HSC-2 oral tumor cell lines and Ca Ski
cervical tumor cell line obtained from the Cancer Research
Initiative Foundation (CARIF, Malaysia), MCF-7 breast adeno-
carcinoma and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma which were obtained
from the University of Malaya Medical Center (UMMC), and
normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) (Lonza Inc.,
USA) used as a normal cell control. For routine maintenance
HSC-4, HSC-2, Ca Ski and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM
and MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640, with both media
types supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin. NHBE cells were cultured with bron-
chial epithelial basal medium (BEBM) with 10% (v/v) FBS,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were
grown as monolayers at 37uC in humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2/95% air.
MTT Cell Viability Assay
The cytotoxic effects of CEB4 on all cell lines were determined
using the MTT assay method. CEB4 was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mM. Briefly
1.0610
4 cells per 100 ml of media were seeded in each well of a 96-
well plate in the presence or absence of CEB4 at final
concentrations of 5 mMt o4 0mM for up to 24 h. MTT (5 mg/
ml) was added to each well (10 ml/well) and plates were incubated
at 37uC for 2 h. After incubation, the medium was replaced with
200 ml DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm for
each well using a microplate reader (Tecan SunriseH, Switzerland).
Annexin V-FITC/PI Analysis
Detection of apoptosis was conducted using the Annexin V-
FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, both CEB4 treated and untreated HSC-4 and
NHBE cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in 1x PBS
and stained with annexin V-FITC conjugate and PI. Cells were
then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur
TM, USA)
using BD CellQuest acquisition and analysis software.
DNA Fragmentation Assay
Total DNA was extracted from both untreated and treated cells
with CEB4 for 12 and 24 h using the SuicideTrack
TM DNA
Isolation Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated DNA
was analysed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and
stained with ethidium bromide. Fragmentation of DNA was
observed under UV illumination using a gel documentation system
(Alpha Inotech, USA).
Western Blotting
CEB4 treated HSC-4 cells were grown to a cell density of 80–
90% confluency, washed with ice-cold 1x PBS and proteins
extracted using the NE-PERH Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extrac-
tion Kit (Pierce, USA). Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).
Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were
subsequently incubated with nine primary antibodies against b-
actin, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), p53, phospho-p53,
murine double minute 2 (MDM2), Bax, Bcl-2, procaspase-3 and
procaspase-9. After washing in Tris-buffered saline and Tween-20
(TBST) buffer, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary
antibodies were added and bound proteins were detected through
enhanced chemiluminescence signals using x-ray films. Relative
intensities of all bands were quantified using image analysis
software (NIH ImageJ v1.43, National Institutes of Health, USA).
Statistical Analysis
All results were expressed as mean 6s.d. of data obtained from
three independent experiments. The statistical significance be-
tween various groups was determined using one-way ANOVA.
Significant differences were considered as p#0.05.

identified. The furan side chain at d 7.64 (s), d 6.29 (br s), and d 7.30
(d, J=1.5 Hz) were attributed to H-21, H-22, and H-23,
respectively. Signals arising from oxygenated methine protons of
H-3 at d 4.91 (d, J=10.2 Hz) and H-17 at d 5.46 (s) were easily
differentiated and assigned based on the signal multiplicity. On the
other hand, the occurrence of an oxygen bridge that links C-1 to C-
29 was deemed rare [11]. The isolated diasterotopic methylene
protons of H2-29 were detected as a pair of doublets at d 3.46 and d
3.88, with a coupling constant of 9.3 Hz. At the allylic alcohol
substructure, the olefinic signal was found at d 5.53 (dd, J=1.7,
7.1 Hz). The cinnamate side chain at C-3 was confirmed by the
presence offivearomatic protons inthe region d 7.10–d 7.20 and the
characteristic doublet signals of H-29 and H-39 at d 6.25 (d,
J=16.0 Hz) and d 7.58 (d, J=15.7 Hz). The relative stereostructure
of erythrocarpin E was established through nuclear Overhauser
effect spectroscopy (NOESY). The chemical structure of CEB4 is
shown in Figure 1.
CEB4 Inhibits the Proliferation of HSC-4 Cells
MTT assays were conducted to assess the cytotoxic attributes
and inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of CEB4 on five human
tumor and NHBE normal cell lines. The results indicated that
CEB4 induces cytotoxicity in a dose and time dependent manner
over a 40.0 mM treatment regime and 24 h of exposure (Fig. 2A
and 2B). Minimal cytotoxic effects were observed on NHBE cells,
where approximately 20.0% killing was observed under similar
treatment conditions, as opposed to 95% killing in HSC-4 cells
with the lowest IC50 value recorded of 4.061.9 mM among all cell
lines tested (Table 1). Viability of cells treated with DMSO without
CEB4 were insignificantly affected (,1.0 %) (Fig. 2A and 2B)
thereby ruling out the involvement of solvent-induced cytotoxicity.
Both time and dose dependent assays supported the need to
further investigate the apoptotic effects of CEB4 and its potential
as an anti-tumor drug for the treatment of oral cancer. All of the
following experiments were carried out based on IC50 values as
obtained from our present MTT data, and are summarized in

Cells
We next determined whether the CEB4 cytotoxic effects were
mediated through apoptosis. An increase in cellular staining with
FITC-conjugated annexin-V serves as an early marker for
apoptosis. Cells were simultaneously stained with PI to investigate
loss of cell membrane integrity. This double staining procedure
distinguishes early stage apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive) from
late stage apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive, PI positive).
Treatment of HSC-4 cells at IC50 concentrations of CEB4 was
found to induce apoptotic cell death through the observation of a
shift in viable cell population from early to late stage of apoptosis,
followed by secondary necrosis (Fig. 3B). The percentage of viable
cells decreased from 99% to 51%, while early and late stage
apoptotic cells increased to 21% and 45% respectively. The total
percentage of apoptotic HSC-4 cells was 63% after 12 h. No
population shifts were observed in the NHBE cells after similar
CEB4 treatment (Fig. 3A).
CEB4 Induces Endonuclease- and Caspase-Mediated
Cleavage of DNA and PARP Respectively
Due to the diverse manner and hallmarks in which the process
of apoptosis can be manifested, we also examined the induction of
apoptosis in HSC-4 cells through the occurrence of DNA
fragmentation and cleavage of PARP proteins. We observed that
DNA extracted from untreated HSC-4 cells showed no fragmen-
tation, while DNA from CEB4-treated HSC-4 cells (12 and 24 h)
showed DNA laddering with approximately 200 bp intervals
presumably as the result of endonuclease action at sites between
nucleosomes (Fig. 4A). The suspected involvement of caspase-3
activation in CEB4-induced apoptosis was also validated through
the expression and degradation of a nuclear protein, PARP.
Proteolytic cleavage of full length PARP from a 116-kDa
polypeptide to an 85-kDa fragment is a typical marker for the
onset of apoptosis, and was observed in a time dependant manner
in HSC-4 cells treated with CEB4 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the
apoptosis-inducing effects of CEB4 on HSC-4 cells was confirmed.
Expression of p53 and other p53-Related Apoptotic
Proteins
Western blotting analysis of CEB4 treated HSC-4 cells was
carried out to examine the status of p53 and p53-related apoptotic
proteins. The results showed that upon CEB4 treatment,
phosphorylated p53 was elevated, while the level of the p53
inhibitor, MDM2, declined over 12 h (Fig. 5A). The total p53 level
was consistent in HSC-4 cells and remained unchanged upon
CEB4 exposure. Protein expression levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax
protein increased after 12 h of CEB4 treatment. On the other
hand, the level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was found to
decrease concomitantly with the change in Bax (Fig. 5B). We also
investigated downstream caspases, and found that the amount of
initiator procaspase-9 and executioner caspase-3 zymogen de-
creased concurrently upon CEB4 exposure, indicating the
activated cleavage of procaspase-9 and the caspase-3 zymogen
(Fig. 5C).
Discussion
The process of apoptosis has become the desired route for
cancerous cells to die, and is normally characterized by
morphological and biochemical changes such as membrane
blebbing, cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation, activation
of cascades of proteases such as caspases and endonucleases,
cleavage of PARP [12] and fragmentation of genomic DNA [13].
Apoptotic cell death is favoured because it does not involve the
sudden release of pro-inflammatory mediators, as in the process of
necrosis [14]. The induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation have been used as benchmarks in the evaluation
of phytochemical anti-cancer activities, where in the past many
chemotherapeutic agents have been found to effect disturbance in
cell cycle progression or the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells
[15].
In this study, evidence from the MTT-based cell viability tests
showed that erythrocarpine E (CEB4) induces both time and dose
dependent cytotoxic effects on all human tumor cell lines tested,
with efficacy being highest in HSC-4 cells. This observation invites
further investigation of the apoptotic effects of CEB4 and its
potential as an anti-tumor drug for the treatment of oral cancers.
At this stage, the epithelial-like origin of NHBE which holds
similarities to HSC-4 merely serves as an initial in vitro control for
drug screening purposes, while the actual physiological side effects
of CEB4 can only be evaluated through in vivo studies. The
minimal cytotoxic effects of CEB4 on NHBE cells (where cell
viability levels remained above 80% upon treatment) provide a
preliminary safety indication for its further development as a
chemotherapeutic agent. Three types of assays were also
conducted to confirm the cell death mechanism of CEB4 on
HSC-4 cells: annexin V-FITC, PARP cleavage and DNA
fragmentation assays. The combined results of these tests indicate
Figure 4. Confirmation of apoptosis mediated cell death in
HSC-4 cells through observation of (A) DNA laddering using
DNA fragmentation assay on cells treated with CEB4 for 12 and
24 h followed by analysis of extracted DNA on 0.1% (w/v)
agarose gel electrophoresis. Smearing of extracted DNA in
lane 1 (0 h) was due to the extraction process. However, no
distinct fragmentations were observed in lane 1 indicating the absence
of apoptosis as opposed to lanes 2 (12 h) and 3 (24 h). (B) PARP
degradation was observed at different CEB4 incubation periods. Equal
amounts of cellular proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and PARP
degradation from its native form (116 kDa) to the cleaved form (89 kDa)
was detected by Western blot analysis.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23661that cytotoxicity induced by CEB4 results from the induction of
apoptosis.
The next pertinent question would be to determine how is
CEB4-dependent apoptosis mediated at the molecular level? Two
major routes of programmed cell death can be distinguished: the
extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The action of p53 is indirectly
related to the intrinsic cell death pathway where it stimulates a
wide network of signals which acts in part through the Bcl-2 family
signalling cascade [16]. Previous reports have indicated that
mutations in p53 play a vital role in cancer initiation and are very
prominent in its linkage to cancers such as colon, lung,
oesophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues and
hematopoietic tissues [17].
The Western blotting results demonstrate an increase in the
level of phosphorylated p53 and a reduction of its inhibitor,
MDM2 suggesting that the mode of induction of apoptosis by
CEB4 is mediated through the intrinsic pathway. This is further
reinforced by observations on mitochondrial proteins, where an
increase of pro-apoptotic protein levels, Bax and reduction of anti-
apoptotic protein levels, Bcl-2 was seen. The ratio between Bcl-2
and Bax regulated the induction of apoptosis by dimerizing with
each other, thereby triggering the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria [18-19]. In addition to CEB4, other natural
compounds that have displayed effects on the induction of p53-
mediated apoptosis were curcumin, resveratrol, anthocyanins and
capsaicin [20]. Previous studies on limonoid-based compounds

Effects of Erythrocarpine E from C. erythrocarpus
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23661from Citrus aurantifolia have also been shown to induce apoptosis
through p53 inactivation [10,20].
The mechanism of action of cytotoxic drugs does not solely
include features such as cell shrinkage and DNA fragmentation,
but also activation of p53 signalling molecules leading to the
activation of a cascade of caspase action [21]. Caspase cascades
can be triggered through two major branches, either through cell
surface TNF-superfamily death receptors and the pivotal adaptor
protein Fas activated death domain (FADD) leading to activation
of caspase-8 and ultimately caspase-3, or via the release of
cytochrome c (Cytc) from mitochondria resulting in caspase-9
activity and subsequent caspase-3 action. Caspase-3, represents a
convergence point between the two routes, and in turn induces
PARP cleavage, chromosomal DNA breaks and finally the
breakdown of the cell into apoptotic bodies [22]. Our results
suggest that CEB4 exerts its apoptotic effects by acting on
caspases-9 and -3, where the level of full length procaspase-9 and
caspase-3 zymogen is decreased upon CEB4 exposure, resulting in
cleaved, activated forms of caspase-9 (37 kDa and 10 kDa)
caspase-3 (17 kDa and 12 kDa). However, apoptotic signal
transduction involving death receptor signalling resulting in
activated initiator caspase-8, which in turn activates zymogen
caspase-3 cannot be ruled out. Mediation of cell death via this
route could explain the observation of an early decrease (,6h )i n
procaspase-3 levels prior to changes in Bcl-2 and Bax which occur
at 12 h (Fig. 5B and 5C). This could also mean that the
involvement of the intrinsic pathway serves as an amplification
step towards initial death signalling via the extrinsic pathway upon
CEB4 exposure.
We conclude that CEB4 induces cytotoxicity through apoptotic
cell death in HSC-4 oral cancer cells, and that the induction of
apoptosis is brought about by the activation of p53, which triggers
the intrinsic pathway through Bcl-2 and Bax, and finally through
caspase-9 and -3 activation. Our data indicates the potential for
the development of CEB4 as a novel potential anti-cancer drug
against human oral cancer, although further work on in vivo safety
effects and pharmacokinetics is required before CEB4 can be fully
evaluated in a clinical setting.
