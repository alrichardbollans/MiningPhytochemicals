(Apocynaceae) contains a large number of terpenoid indolealkaloids (TIAs). This study focused on the composition of alkaloids obtained from transformedhairy root cultures of R. stricta employing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-massspectrometry (UPLC-MS). In the UPLC-MS analyses, a total of 20 TIAs were identified from crudeextracts. Eburenine and vincanine were the main alkaloids followed by polar glucoalkaloids,strictosidine lactam and strictosidine. Secodine-type alkaloids, tetrahydrosecodinol, tetrahydro- anddihydrosecodine were detected too. The occurrence of tetrahydrosecodinol was confirmed for thefirst time for R. stricta. Furthermore, two isomers of yohimbine, serpentine and vallesiachotaminewere identified. The study shows that a characteristic pattern of biosynthetically related TIAs canbe monitored in Rhazya hairy root crude extract by this chromatographic method.Keywords: Rhazya stricta; terpenoid indole alkaloids; ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry1. IntroductionRhazya stricta Decne. belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is widely distributed in the MiddleEast and Indian sub-continent. The plant has a long history in folk medicine and has been used totreat several diseases [1]. It produces a large number of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) classifiedinto 17 subgroups. Hitherto, more than 100 alkaloids have been found in R. stricta [2].Structure elucidation of isolated Rhazya alkaloids has been carried out by NMR spectroscopyand high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) operated in electron ionization (EI) mode [1].A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method has been developedfor the separation of alkaloids from somatic hybrid cell cultures of Rauwolfia serpentina ˆ R. strictausing phosphate buffer and ion pair reagent [3]. It is a common practice to use standard compoundsin the identification of alkaloids in HPLC-UV-MS, since the chromatographic and spectroscopicproperties of standard compounds can be compared with those present in the extract. However,the availability of authentic standard compounds is limited since only a few pure compoundspresent in R. stricta are commercially available and components must therefore be isolated andpurified from crude extracts, which makes the identification complex and time consuming [4].Recently, an improved chromatographic separation of alkaloids was achieved by the introduction ofMolecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634; doi:10.3390/molecules201219873 www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) [5–7]. In UPLC, the stationary phase particle sizeof less than 2.5 µm has been shown to result in a significant improvement in separation efficiency [8].In our previous study, we established hairy root cultures of R. stricta and investigated theaccumulation of major alkaloids in transgenic roots by HPLC. The identification of the alkaloidswas based on the correlation of UV and MS data from HPLC and UPLC analyses [9]. Rhazyaalkaloids comprise a wide range of structures and polarities; therefore, it was necessary tofirst develop analytical methods to determine the alkaloids. Using gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS), a total of 20 compounds, including six new compounds for Rhazya, mainlynon-polar alkaloids, were found on Rhazya alkaloids in our previous study [10]. The present workparticularly aims at in depth identification of more polar alkaloids in crude extracts of hairy roots byultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis that could not beanalysed by GC-MS.2. Results2.1. UPLC-Photodiode Array (PDA) Method TestTwo isocratic and three gradient programs were carried out. The first isocratic run, containing55% solvent A (10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10 in water), showed better separation compared tothe second run, but major peaks still overlapped during the first three minutes. Therefore, smallercompounds were separated better. In the second isocratic run, with 65% solvent A, the majority ofthe compounds were eluting very rapidly, even before three minutes.In the first gradient run, containing 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A), all the major peakseluted in the first two minutes. In the second gradient run, with 1% formic acid, several minorcomponents co-eluted with three major peaks in the middle of the run. The best separation of theseexperiments was obtained in the third gradient run (solvent A, pH 10/acetonitrile solvent B), andthese conditions were used in the UPLC-PDA-MS analyses of three representative wild type hairyroot clones 2, 3 and 10.2.2. Alkaloid Composition2.2.1. Analysis of Reference Substances by UPLC-PDA-MSFour reference substances were analysed in positive ion mode (Table 1). A total ion scan ofvincanine showed a protonated molecular ion ([M + H]+) at m/z 293. Other major fragments werenot detected. Yohimbine had three UV maxima and an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 355 accompaniedby three minor fragments. Vincamine, having a similar UV spectrum and molecular weight asyohimbine, could be distinguished from it by an intense fragment ion m/z 337, due to the loss of water([M + H ´ H2O]+). Tabersonine displayed three UV maxima. The molecular ion of this compoundwas detected at m/z 337, together with a smaller fragment at m/z 305 due to the loss of methanol([(M + H ´ CH3OH)]+).Table 1.

Identification of Alkaloids by UPLC-PDA-MSThe UPLC-UV chromatogram of a Rhazya extract at 255 nm is illustrated in Figure 1A.Comparisons between electrospray ionization (ESI) techniques demonstrate that the majority of22622Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634abundant alkaloids could be detected in positive ion mode (ESI+) (Figure 1B). Negative ion analyses(ESI´) exhibited clearly fewer peaks, but instead, cleaner spectra were obtained. Practically noproper peaks were observed after 10 min of elution (Figure 1C). The formation of sodium adducts([M + H + Na]+) in positive ion mode and acetate adducts [M ´ H + CH3COOH]´ in negative ionmode was observed for some compounds (Table 2). The UV and mass spectra of the target alkaloidshave been collected and presented in Figures S1 and S2, respectively.Figure 1. UPLC-UV chromatogram (A) and MS-ESI+ (B) and -ESI´ (C) iongrams of R. stricta alkaloids.Data for vincadifformine (12) is presented in Figure S3.It also became evident from the total ion scan (Figure 1B) that baseline separations could notbe obtained. A number of symmetric peaks practically without extra signals were detected usingextracted ion recording. This method was also used to detect the compounds with the same molecularion (Figure 2). The alkaloids were identified based on their UV spectra, [M + H]+ and [M ´ H]´ ionsand fragment ions, the data from reference compounds (Table 1) and literature data.Compound 1 (Table 2, Figure 3, Figures S1 and S2) was identified as strictosidine lactam.Compound 2 was identified as rhazine on the basis of UV and MS spectra. Compound 3, whichhad a UV spectrum closely similar to that of alkaloid 1 (Figure S1), exhibited a protonated molecularion [M + H]+ at m/z 531 in positive ion mode. Occurrence of the characteristic fragment ion m/z 514([M + H ´ OH]+) indicated the cleavage of a hydroxyl group (Figure S2). In negative ion mode,the corresponding deprotonated ion [M ´H]´ was detected at m/z 529. This alkaloid was identifiedas strictosidine (Table 2, Figure 3).Based on UV and MS data, compounds 6 and 14 were identified as vincanine and eburenine(Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2, Figures S1 and S2). Comparison of the ESI+ signals of vincanine (6; channelm/z 293, Figure 2) and eburenine (14; channel m/z 281) showed equally high intensities. However,the UV chromatogram and total scan iongrams exhibited considerable peak tailing (Figure 1A–C).Thus, the neighbouring sharp peak on the right side of vincanine was strongly distorted at the UVmaximum (365 nm) and at [M + H]+ m/z 293 of vincanine (Figure 1B). The [M + H]+ ion of eburenineat m/z 281 similarly interfered with the separation of vallesiachotamine isomers (Figure 1B, Table 2).22623Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634Figure 2.

Structures of alkaloids identified by UPLC-PDA-MS. Numbers refer to compounds in Table 2. Compounds 6, 7, 11 and 20 were identified by directcomparison with authentic reference samples, thus their structures are depicted with assignment of relative configurations. All other compounds, including anisomer (8) of yohimbine (7), were tentatively assigned based on their mass spectra and are therefore depicted without stereochemical assignment.22625Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634Compound 7 had the same retention time in the UPLC-MS analysis of Rhazya extract (Table 2)as the pure yohimbine reference substance (Table 1). In addition to compound 7, another yohimbineisomer (8) was detected having similar UV and MS spectra (Table 2, Figures S1 and S2). The intensityof these isomers displayed at channel m/z 355 was among the lowest of all alkaloids (Figure 2).A further yohimbine-like compound with an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 355 eluted at 3.26 min, but theMS spectrum was considerably distorted by extra ions at m/z 297 (100) and 293 (38).Compounds 9 and 10 (Figure 3) had identical UV maxima (Figure S1) and molecular ions atm/z 349 (ESI+) (Figure S2) and m/z 347 (ESI´) (Table 2). The compounds were identified as serpentineisomers. Isomer I had a higher intensity than isomer II (Figure 2).In the UV and total ion chromatogram (Figure 1A,B), the vincamine peak (11, Table 2) in Rhazyaextracts was hardly visible due to co-elution with the adjacent compound. However, the extractedion channel at m/z 355 (Figure 2), showed the same retention time (tR) at 5.03 min as the referencecompound (Table 1). Despite its very low intensity, vincamine displayed a rather symmetric peakwith baseline separation.Compounds 13 and 15 exhibited equal UV maxima and had a base peak ion [M + H´ CH3OH]+at m/z 319 in positive ion mode (Table 2). Based on UV and MS data, these compounds were identifiedas vallesiachotamine isomers. Extracted ion recording (ESI+ channel m/z 351; Figure 2) also showeda peak zone at 1.9–2.1 minutes composed of two alkaloids corresponding to leepacine isomers (4, 5).Both UV and mass spectra are presented in Figures S1 and S2. On the basis of UV and MS spectra,compound 17 was identified as tetrahydroalstonine.Compounds 16, 18 and 19 constituted a specific group of alkaloids having a base peak fragmentat m/z 126 (Table 2). No fragment ions at higher mass range were found after the molecularions (Figure S2). Compound 16 displayed low-intensity UV maxima (Figure S1) and a protonatedmolecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 359 in positive ion mode. The fragment ion at m/z 341 occurreddue to the loss of water [M + H ´ H2O]+. This alkaloid was identified as tetrahydrosecodinol andconstitutes a new record for R. stricta. Compound 18 had an identical UV absorbance with alkaloid16 and showed typical fragmentation for tetrahydrosecodine (Table 2). Compound 19, displaying anUV maximum at a higher wavelength of 305 nm and an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 341, was identified asdihydrosecodine. The structures of these compounds are illustrated in Figure 3. Some evidence forthe presence of dimeric secamine-type alkaloids was also obtained. For example, the molecular ionm/z 681 with a typical base peak at m/z 126 and the parent monomer ion at m/z 341 was found atvarious retention times.Compound 20 was identified as tabersonine based on comparison of UV and mass spectra andretention time with the authentic reference standard (Tables 1 and 2). The structure of tabersonine isshown in Figure 3. In addition, another compound displaying similar UV spectrum as tabersoninewas detected. By using extracted ion recording (channel m/z 339) from TIC, clone number 3 showedan abundant and symmetric peak at 7.1 min (Figure S3A,B) exhibiting UV absorption with threeintense maxima and fragment ion m/z 307 due to the loss of methanol. No further fragments higherthan the molecular ion (m/z 339) were detected (Figure S3C,D). The data suggest that this alkaloid isvincadifformine (12).22626Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634Table 2.

DiscussionGenerally, all alkaloids occur in multicomponent mixtures and the separation of alkaloids fromother groups of natural products is the first requirement for comprehensive and detailed qualitativeand quantitative analyses of single alkaloids. Acidic inorganic extraction solvents are commonlyused, since they are known to improve the stability and solubility of alkaloids [34]. Therefore, thistype of alkaloid-specific extraction method utilizing diluted sulphuric acid was applied in the study.Further sample preparation included alkalinization by diluted ammonia and subsequent extractionwith organic solvent.The development of LC conditions includes a large number of different parameters. For example,the selection of an appropriate solvent system and proportions of organic solvent and buffer solutions,concentration of buffer salt and ion pair reagent, and acidic or alkaline pH must be taken intoaccount [4].The solvent system of the UPLC method was tested under different conditions without ionpair reagent to obtain well-resolved peaks of major alkaloids. A good peak shape and sensitivity ofvarious alkaloids was obtained from the repeated injections using the gradient condition (A: 10 mMammonium acetate, pH 10; B: acetonitrile). This condition showing improved separation combinedwith alkaline pH and the use of a BEH C18 column agree well with the analysis of yohimbe barkalkaloids by [7], who reported that this column provided better separation compared to other testedcolumns. In addition, similar column performance has been reported for the UPLC analyses ofalkaloids from Lindera aggregata [5], C. roseus [35] and Coptidis spp. [36].In our previous study, transgenic hairy roots of R. stricta were developed for the investigationof their capacity to accumulate alkaloids. The alkaloid profile and contents of five major alkaloids in20 transformed R. stricta hairy root clones were compared to non-transformed roots by data obtainedfrom HPLC analysis [9]. HPLC analysis was performed according to the method described in [3]with a slightly modified gradient program. The use of phosphate buffer and heptanesulphonic acidas an ion exchange reagent resulted in a clearly improved separation of alkaloids. However, the useof phosphate buffer and heptanesulphonic acid is not compatible with LC-MS analysis, which wasapplied for the identification of the alkaloids. The identification of five major alkaloids in the Rhazyaextract was therefore based on the resemblance of their UV data from HPLC analyses and UV andMS data from UPLC-MS.In the present study, the focus was on comprehensive alkaloid profiling of R. stricta hairyroots, from three representative clones, by UPLC-MS. The method resulted in the identification of20 alkaloids (Table 2). The identification of six alkaloids, vincanine, leepacine isomers, strictosidinelactam and serpentine isomers in our previous work [9] is further supported by their MS spectra(Figure S2). Strictosidine (3), vincanine (6) and eburenine (14) were the most abundant alkaloids(Figure 3). The alkaloids belong to nine subgroups including aspidosperma- (12, 14, 20), ajmaline-(4, 5), eburnamine- (11), heteroyohimbine- (9, 10, 17), hunterburine-type (13, 15), strictosidine- (1, 3),sarpagine- (2), secodine- (16, 18, 19), strychnos- (6), and yohimbinoid- (7, 8) type alkaloids [1,37].Strictosidine, a monoterpene indole alkaloid glycoside, is a universal precursor of the terpenoidindole and related alkaloids and was first isolated from R. stricta [38]. Secodine-type alkaloids,derived in a series of reactions from strictosidine, are of considerable biogenetic interest as latestage intermediates in eburnamine-, aspidosperma- and strychnos-type alkaloid biosynthesis. Thealkaloids occur in various stages of cyclisation, and in monomeric and dimeric forms [39,40].Our investigation on alkaloid composition in R. stricta hairy roots, analysed by the LC-MSmethod reported here and the previously applied GC-MS method [10], has hitherto resulted in theidentification of 31 terpenoid indole alkaloids, ten of which were detected exclusively with UPLC-MS.A list of the alkaloids, their identification method and the subgroup they belong to is presented inTable S1.Higher selectivity and sensitivity of MS can be achieved through extracting ions from totalion chromatograms (TIC) [41]. This is useful for revising data to detect isomers, resolve co-eluting22628Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634substances and detect minor compounds. In the current study, extracted ion recording was appliedto detect minor alkaloids, e.g., alkaloids 4, 5, 7–10, alkaloids exhibiting the same molecular ion orpeaks (e.g., 7, 8, 11) or those eluting closely, e.g., 13, 14 (Figure 2). Extracted ions from TIC provideclean chromatograms and sharp peaks of compounds of interest; therefore, TIC is widely used forquantification of compounds, too, e.g., alkaloids in C. roseus [20,21].An HPLC method had been applied for the separation of crude extracts of Rhazya cellcultures [24] and strictosidine lactam was among the major alkaloids found. In this study,both UV and LC-MS spectra of this alkaloid were consistent with those reported in a number ofpapers investigating other plant species such as Ophiorrhiza pumila [11], Nauclea pobeguinii [12] andNauclea latifolia [13] or the metabolism of strictosamide in animal studies [14]. Strictosidine lactam (1)is another major alkaloid in Catharanthus roseus [42], and it has also been identified in the hairy rootcultures of C. roseus along with tabersonine, tetrahydroalstonine and yohimbine [43]. Strictosidine (3),which has been long known as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of indole alkaloids [38,39],was among the principal alkaloids in Rhazya extract. Its UV and MS data were in full accordancewith those reported earlier [11].Rhazine (syn. akuammidine) was among the first alkaloids to be isolated from R. stricta [44].In the current study, the UV and MS data of rhazine (2) were in line with those obtained by ion traptime-of-flight mass spectrometric (LC-MS-IT-TOF) analyses of Alstonia scholaris [15,16].Leepacine isomers (4, 5) showed identical UV spectra and also the molecular ion m/z 351. Thesealkaloids can be distinguished from vallesiachotamine on the basis of their retention time and UVabsorbance. The two main UV maxima corresponded to literature values [1,45] and the third one wasshifted slightly towards higher wavelength as indicated in Figure S1. It is known that UV maximaof Rhazya alkaloids can shift to a slightly higher wavelength in alkaline conditions [46]. At pH 6,leepacine has shown a third UV maximum at 298 nm [45]. The low-intensity UV maximum at 363 nmwas probably caused by the interference of vincanine (6).Vincanine (6) was present as a main component together with eburenine (14). The UVand MS data (Table 2) were in accordance with those obtained from pure substance and HR-MSanalyses of isolated vincanine from R. stricta [17] and from Vinca spp. [18]. Vincanine, also called(´)-nor-C-fluorocurarine, belongs to strychnos-type alkaloids, and was already isolated in the 1960sfrom Diplorhynchus condylocarpon [47]. Since then, it had been discovered in R. stricta [17] and later asa major alkaloid in its cell culture [24].Yohimbine isomers have previously been isolated from suspension cultures of R. serpentinaplants [48], whereas they have not been identified in R. stricta. Yohimbine isomers (compounds 7and 8) possess a tetrahydro-β-carboline moiety and have a pronounced deprotonated molecular ionm/z 353 in ESI´. In addition, the UV and ESI+ spectra (Table 2) were also fully consistent with those ofthe reference compound and reported from yohimbe bark [7,19]. Using the UPLC-MS method, twoyohimbine isomers (7, 8) with similar fragmentation patterns were separated with retention timesvery close to each other in our study.Serpentine is a quaternary alkaloid, which is typical for Rauwolfia [49] and Catharanthus [50]species, but it has not been reported earlier in Rhazya species. In the current study, extracted ionrecording in ESI+ and ESI´ revealed two peaks. Isomer I showed higher intensity than isomer II(9, 10). The UV and ESI+-MS data (Table 2) were consistent with serpentine from C. roseus extractsanalysed by ESI-IT-MS [20] and by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS [21,22].Vincamine (11), a member of the eburnamine-type alkaloids, has not been reported in intactRhazya plants or cell cultures. Vincamine showed the same retention time, fragmentation pattern,UV and ESI+-MS data as the pure reference compound. Furthermore, these data were also in linewith those reported in the literature [18,23].In the present study, two isomers of vallesiachotamine (13, 15) were identified from R. strictahairy root extracts. The mass spectra of the isomers exhibited typical fragments, [M + H]+ at m/z 351and a fragment of tetrahydro-β-carboline moiety at m/z 170. These isomers possess a strong UV22629Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–22634absorption in the 290 nm region, which is characteristic for hunterburine-type alkaloids [25]. BothUV and MS profiles of the isomers (Table 2) were in line with EI-MS or HR-MS data reported fromR. stricta [26–28] and additionally with those of Vallesia dichotoma [25] and Strychnos tricalysioides [29].Detailed isomeric analyses by NMR have shown that the hydrogen linked to C19 is in the transposition in vallesiachotamine but cis in isovallesiachotamine [29]. These isomers have also beenidentified in R. stricta cell suspension cultures [24,28,51,52].Spectral data of tetrahydroalstonine (17) was consistent with data reported in theliterature [30,33]. This compound has previously been isolated from R. stricta but has not beenreported from Rhazya cell cultures.The group of secodine alkaloids include tetrahydrosecodine (18) and dihydrosecodine (19)together with tetrahydrosecodinol (16), which was identified in R. stricta for the first time. The basepeak fragment m/z 126 is typical for alkaloids containing a secodine skeleton with a saturated(16, 18) or unsaturated (19) piperidine ring [32]. The molecular ion m/z 358 of tetrahydrosecodinol,obtained by EI-MS, readily loses water and produces a radical ion m/z 340 corresponding to [M+]of 15,20-dihydrosecodine [53]. This structure also allowed the double bond to be located in thepiperidine unit. The present UV and MS data of tetrahydrosecodinol (16), tetrahydrosecodine (18)and dihydrosecodine (19) were consistent with the data from pure compounds isolated from Rhazyaspecies [32].Three indicative MS fragments including molecular ion, base peak (m/z 126) and parental ion fordimeric alkaloids were detected. The fact that these fragments were encountered at different retentiontimes can be due to the incompatible pH of the eluent leading to several broadened peak zonesspread along the baseline. Dimeric secamine and presecamine alkaloids with similar MS spectra havebeen reported in Rhazya already long ago [53,54]. Secodine is a presumed precursor of the dimericgroup, which in turn produces the secamine group alkaloids [55]. Presecamines can be formed by thenon-enzymatic dimerization of secodine units, either in the cell or during extraction [53,55].Tabersonine (20), belonging to aspidosperma-type alkaloids, has been reported fromR. orientalis leaves [56] and R. stricta cell cultures [24,52]. Vincadifformine (12), called earlier6,7-dihydrotabersonine, is another member of this family [31]. Vincadifformine and eburenine (14)have been isolated from leaves of R. stricta and detected from the crude extract of its hybrid cellcultures by HPLC analysis [24,52]. In the current study, the spectral data of 20 was the same as in thepure reference compound and was in line with data reported in the literature [11–18,21,22,24,42–50].The UV and MS data of 12 (Figure S3) was in accordance with those of Rhazya cell cultures [24].4. Experimental Section4.1. ChemicalsAll solvents used for the extraction and chromatographic analysis were of analyticalgrade. Ammonium acetate, formic acid and sulphuric acid (95%–97%) were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), ammonia solution 25% from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany)and dichloromethane (DCM) from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, UK). Vincanine was purchasedfrom Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY, USA), vincamine, tabersonine, andyohimbine hydrochloride from Sigma-Aldrich. Purified water was obtained by PURELAB UltraAnalytic Water Purification System (ELGA LabWater, High Wycombe, UK).4.2. Plant MaterialSeeds of R. stricta were collected from Iran (Hormozgan province, Minab zone in the PersianGulf area 27˝08148” N, 57˝04148” E). In order to obtain hairy roots, R. stricta leaves from seedlingswere co-cultivated with wild type A. rhizogenes strain LBA 9402 as described in [9].22630Molecules 2015, 20, 22621–226344.3. ExtractionAlkaloids were extracted from hairy roots as described in [9]. Briefly, alkaloids wereextracted from the lyophilized powdered samples by adding 10% sulphuric acid (v/v). The acidicsupernatants were basified to pH 10 with 25% ammonia solution. Alkaloids were then extracted withdichloromethane. The extracts were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen flow and dissolved into500 µL methanol to be injected to UPLC-MS.4.4. UPLC-PDA-MSThe UPLC-PDA-MS analyses were performed on a Waters Micromass Quattro micro™ triplequadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray source combined with Waters Acquity UltraPerformance LC (UPLC) with photodiode array detector (PDA). The column was an Acquity UPLC™BEH C18 (100 mm ˆ 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) with a precolumn and the analyses were performed at 25 ˝C.The solvent system was made alkaline as described earlier [57]. It consisted of a mixture of 10 mMammonium acetate (pH 10; A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min.Two isocratic runs were tested using either 55% or 65% solvent A (10 mM ammonium acetate,pH 10 in water) and 45% or 35%, respectively, solvent B (acetonitrile).Three gradient runs were also tested. The solvent proportions were changed in 15 min from 35%to 50% (solvent B). In the first gradient run, the solvent system contained 0.1% formic acid in water(solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). In the second gradient run, the concentration of formic acidin water was tenfold (1%). In the last gradient run, the solvents contained 10 mM ammonium acetate,pH 10 in water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B).The analyses were performed both in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI´) electrospray ionizationmode and the data were collected in a mass range of m/z 100–850. The capillary and cone energieswere 2.5 kV and 40 V in ESI+ and 2.5 kV and 20 V in ESI´ mode, respectively. Source temperature was125 ˝C and desolvation temperature 350 ˝C. Desolvation gas flow was 800 L/h. The PDA detectorwas scanning wavelengths from 200 to 420 nm.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, an UPLC-MS method was developed for the determination of more polarterpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) in crude extracts of R. stricta hairy roots. A total of 20 TIAsbelonging to nine subgroups were identified. Among them, tetrahydrosecodinol has not beenpreviously reported from R. stricta. Strictosidine and secodine-type alkaloids, two main intermediatesin the biosynthesis of TIAs, were detected too. Extracted ion recording was used to detect thecompounds with the same molecular ion, minor and co-eluting components. The method presentedhere is applicable for the separation and identification of alkaloids in R. stricta hairy roots.Supplementary Materials: Supplementary materials can be accessed at: http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/20/12/19873/s1.Acknowledgments: This study was financially supported by The Graduate School in Pharmaceutical Research(GSPR) and The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters.
