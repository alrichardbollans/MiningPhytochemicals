Abstract
Background: Nymphaea alba L. represents an interesting field of study. Flowers have antioxidant and hepatoprotective
effects, rhizomes constituents showed cytotoxic activity against liver cell carcinoma, while several Nymphaea species have
been reported for their hepatoprotective effects. Leaves of N. alba have not been studied before. Therefore, in this study,
in-depth characterization of the leaf phytoconstituents as well as its antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities have been
performed where N. alba leaf extract was evaluated as a possible therapeutic alternative in hepatic disorders.
Methods: The aqueous ethanolic extract (AEE, 70%) was investigated for its polyphenolic content identified by
high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS/MS), while the petroleum ether fraction was
saponified, and the lipid profile was analysed using gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis and compared with
reference standards. The hepatoprotective activity of two doses of the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg; P.O.) for 5 days was
evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar albino rats, in comparison with silymarin. Liver function tests;
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were performed. Oxidative stress parameters; malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced
glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as inflammatory
mediator; tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected in the liver homogenate. Histopathological examination of the
liver and immunohistochemical staining of caspase-3 were performed
Results: Fifty-three compounds were tentatively identified for the first time in N.alba leaf extract, where ellagitannins
represent the main identified constituents. Nine hydrocarbons, two sterols and eleven fatty acids were identified in the
petroleum ether extract where, palmitic acid and linolenic acids represented the major saturated and unsaturated fatty
acid respectively. N.alba AEE significantly improved the liver function, oxidative stress parameters as well as TNF-α in
addition to the amelioration of histopathological features of the liver and a profound decrease in caspase-3 expression.
Conclusion: These results shed light on the hepatoprotective effect of N. alba that is comparable with that of silymarin.
The antioxidant activities of N. alba extract in addition to the inhibition of crucial inflammatory mediator, as TNF-α, might
be the possible hepatoprotective mechanisms.

Background
Hepatotoxicity is a prevalent problem worldwide. Carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4) is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that is
commonly used in industries as a solvent and in medicine
as a vermifuge. The compound is also found at low levels
in ambient air and water [1]. Exposure to CCl4 is known
to result in acute hepatotoxicity in humans and experi-
mental animals. It is widely used in scientific research as a
model of hepatotoxicity and to evaluate hepatoprotective
agents [2, 3]. CCl4 is converted by cytochrome P450 2E1
to trichloromethyl free radical (CCl3∙) and trichloro-
methylperoxy radical (CCl3OO∙). Both radicals initiate
lipid peroxidation and protein deterioration with subse-
quent damage of the cellular membrane and leakage of
intracellular enzymes into the serum. These processes
eventually lead to inactivation of the calcium pump with
calcium influx and subsequent liver cell death. Moreover,
lipid peroxidation and damage of hepatocyte membranes
initiated by CCl4 was reported to be associated with the
release of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necro-
sis factor (TNF)-α from activated hepatic macrophages,
which potentiate CCl4-induced hepatic injury [3, 4].
Nymphaea alba L. (N. alba), known as the European
water lily, White Lotus, or Nenuphar, is an aquatic flower-
ing plant of the family Nymphaeaceae. N. alba was widely
used in Indian folk medicinal products as an antiseptic, an
astringent, radical scavenger, in burning and in insomnia
while rhizomes are applied externally as a rubefacient [5].
Previously published studies reported the antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory as well as hepatoprotective effect of N.
alba flowers [6–8]. These effects may result from the
phenolic constituents, including ellagic and gallic acid and
their methyl and ethyl esters and flavonoids as aglycones
of quercetin, kaempferol, isokaempferide, apigenin and
their glycosides previously identified in the flowers [9, 10].
A recent study on the rhizomes revealed the presence of
hydrolysable tannins, glycosylated phenolic acids and
flavonoids. The methyl and ethyl gallate as well as penta-
galloyl glucose, the main constituents identified, showed
powerful cytotoxic activity against liver cell carcinoma
[11]. Leaves of the white flowered water lily have been
evaluated for their cytotoxic, antiproliferative and anxio-
lytic activities [12–14].
The broad range of traditional uses along with the previ-
ous reports concerning the hepatoprotective effect of N.
alba flowers [7] as well as other Nymphaea species [15],
and the absence of any reports about the phytochemical
profile of N. alba leaf, aroused our interest in N. alba as a
source of bioactive compounds. This study represents the
first detailed chemical investigation of N. alba leaf that dem-
onstrates the presence of a variety of free and conjugated
forms of ellagic acid and ellagitannins tentatively identified
by high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrom-
etry (HRESI-MS/MS) in the aqueous ethanolic extract.
Hepatoprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity
of the N. alba leaf extract against CCl4- induced hepatotox-
icity have also been studied and showed promising results.
Methods
Plant material
Leaves of N. alba L. were collected from El Orman Gardens,
Giza, Egypt, in November, 2013 during the flowering stage.
Authentication of the plant was performed by Dr. Therese
Labib Youssef (consultant in plant taxonomy, Ministry of
Agriculture). A voucher specimen (RS006) is deposited at
the herbarium of the Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty
of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Science and
Arts, Egypt.
Extraction
The powdered air-dried leaves of N. alba (300 g) were
exhaustively extracted with aqueous ethanol (70% v/v)
under reflux. After filtration, the aqueous ethanolic
extract (AEE) was evaporated to dryness in vacuum at
40 °C to yield 33 g.
Liquid chromatography coupled with High-resolution
electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC-HRESI-MS/MS)
LC-HRESI-MS/MS was performed on a Bruker Micro-
TOF-Q Daltonics (API) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer
(Bremen, Germany), coupled to a 1200 series HPLC system
(Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), equipped
with a high performance autosampler, binary pump, and
PDA detector G 1314 C (SL). Chromatographic separation
was performed on a Superspher 100 RP-18 (75 × 4 mm i.d.;
4 μm) column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
Identification of Phenolic Compounds of AEE of N. alba
by LC-HRESI-MS/MS
The method was performed according to Hassaan et al.
[16]. Injection volume was 10 μL. The solvents were: (A)
2% acetic acid (pH 2.6) and (B) 80% methanol, 2% acetic
acid, and pH 2.6. The gradient elution was from 5 to 50%
B at 30 °C at a flow rate of 100 μL/min. The ionization
technique was an ion spray (pneumatically assisted electro-
spray). Spectra were recorded in positive and negative ion
modes between m/z 120 and 1,500 with capillary voltage,
4000 V and heated dry nitrogen gas (temperature, 200 °C)
and flow rate 10 L/min. The gas flow to the nebulizer was
set at pressure 1.6 bar. For collision-induced dissociation
(CID) MS/MS measurements, the voltage over the
collision cell varied from 20 to 70 eV. Argon was used as
the collision gas. Data analysis software was used for data
interpretation. Sodium formate was used for calibration at
the end of the LC/MS run. Interpretation for ESI-MS was
performed by Xcalibur 2.2 SP1 software from Thermo
Scientific (Berlin, Germany).

Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC) of Unsaponifiable
Matter (USM) and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME)
Powdered air-dried leaves (100 g) were exhaustively ex-
tracted with petroleum ether (60–80 °C). The petroleum
ether extract was filtered and evaporated under reduced
pressure. The petroleum ether extract (1 g) was saponified
by refluxing with ethanolic KOH (20%) at 60 °C for 2 h
and then exhaustively extracted with ether. The combined
ethereal extracts were washed, dehydrated over anhydrous
sodium sulphate, evaporated to dryness and then analysed
as unsaponifiable matter (USM) for the hydrocarbon and
sterol contents. The saponified extract was acidified with
HCl (5 N) and then extracted several times with ether. The
combined ethereal extracts were evaporated to dryness,
esterified into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by reflux
with MeOH:H2SO4 (50:3) and extracted with ether [17].
The ether extracts of the USM and FAME fractions
were analysed by GLC against the available authentic stan-
dards. Identification of hydrocarbons, sterols, and fatty
acid methyl esters was carried out by comparing retention
times of the peaks with those of the available authentic
standards. FAMEs were analysed on a 70% Thermo Scien-
tific Trace TR-FAME gas chromatographic (GC) capillary
column packed with 70% Cyanopropyl Polysilphenylene-
siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm id. The injector and detector
temperatures were set at 250 and 300 °C, respectively. The
temperature was increased 70 ° C to 190 °C at a rate of 8 °
C /min. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas (30 ml/min).
USM was analysed on a Capillary HP6890 series,
1.5 m × 4 mm i.d. The injector and detector temperatures
were set at 250 and 300 °C, respectively. The temperature
was increased from 70 to 270 °C, at a rate of 10 °C /min.
Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas (30 mL/min).
1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging
activity
A weighed amount of AEE was dissolved in methanol
(100 μg/mL), screened for its free radical scavenging activity
using the stable free radical DPPH, and then measured
spectrophotometrically. The absorbance was measured at
517 nm and carried out in triplicate [18]. Radical scaven-
ging activity was calculated by the following formula: DPPH
scavenging effect (%) = [(A0 - A1)/A0) × 100], where A0
was the absorbance of the control reaction, and A1 was the
absorbance of the sample [19]. The concentration of sample
required to scavenge 50% of the DPPH was calculated from
a graph plotted for the % inhibition against the concentra-
tion in μg/mL. Ascorbic acid was used as standard.
Hepatoprotective activity
Experimental animals
Eight-week-old male Wistar albino rats (200–220 g) were
purchased from the National Institute of Ophthalmology,
Egypt. The animals were kept in the animal house, October
University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Egypt. All
animals were kept in a pathogen-free facilities under stand-
ard laboratory conditions (temperature 25 ± 2 °C and 12 h
light/12 h dark cycle) with free access to food and water.
The animals were housed in groups of four in plastic cages
with sawdust bedding. Experimental work was carried out
in laboratories at MSA University, Egypt. Procedures
involving animals and their care were in conformity with
the institutional guidelines (Approval number of ethics
committee, MSA University, EC 10 PG10/2011) and in
compliance with national and international laws on the care
and use of laboratory animals.
Experimental design
Two different doses of N. alba (100 and 200 mg/kg) were
tested for their hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-in-
duced hepatotoxicity. Doses and route of administration
selection were according to previously published studies
[12, 13]. Hepatotoxicity was induced by injection of a sin-
gle intraperitoneal (I.P.) dose of CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg) [20].
A total of 40 rats were randomly divided into five
groups ( n = 8). Group I (Control): received vehicles.
Group II (CCl4): received CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg; I.P.) once.
Group III (N. alba low dose): received CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg;
I.P.) +N. alba extract (100 mg/kg; P.O.) 24 h after CCl4
for 5 days. Group IV (N. alba high dose): received CCl4
(0.5 ml/kg; I.P.) +N. alba (200 mg/kg; P.O.) 24 h after
CCl4 for 5 days. Group V (Silymarin): received CCl4
(0.5 ml/kg; I.P.) + silymarin (100 mg/kg; P.O.) 24 h after
CCl4 for 5 days. Treatments were given at 10 a.m.
Twenty-four hours after the last dose of treatments, blood
samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus.
Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °
C. Rats were sacrificed; livers were excised, rinsed in ice-
cold saline and blotted dry. Slices of liver tissue were fixed
in 10% neutral formalin for histopathological examination
and immunostaining of caspase-3. The rest of the liver
tissue was weighed and homogenized in phosphate buffer
saline to prepare 10% homogenate and stored at −80 °C.
Assessment of biochemical markers of hepatic injury
Biochemical parameters reflecting liver functions such as
serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino-
transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma
glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were
estimated using commercially available kits, according to
the manufacturer instructions (Spectrum, Egypt).
Assessment of oxidative stress in the liver
Liver malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione
(GSH) contents, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismut-
ase (SOD) activities and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)
were assessed spectrophotometrically using commercial
kits supplied by Bio-diagnostic (Bio-diagnostic, Egypt).

Estimation of inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α
TNF-α content was measured in liver homogenate using an
ELISA kit (BioLegend ELISA MAX™ Deluxe kit; BioLegend,
San Diego, CA, USA). The assay was performed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Histopathological examination of the liver
Liver specimens in 10% neutral formalin were embedded
in paraffin and cut into 4 μm thick sections. Sections were
stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined
under a light microscope for histological changes.
Immunohistochemical staining for caspase-3 in liver
Caspase-3 expression in the liver was detected by immuno-
staining of sections prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded livers using caspase-3 detection kits according to
the manufacturer instructions. The intensity of caspase-3
immunostaining was assessed as follows: 0 – none, 1 – mild,
2 – moderate and 3 – strong. The Immunohistochemical
histological score (H-score) was calculated by multiplying
the intensity by the percentage of caspase-3 positive cells,
creating a range of possible scores of 0–300 [21].
Statistical analysis
Data from animal work are expressed as the mean ± stand-
ard error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons between differ-
ent groups were carried out by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer test. The level of
significance was set at p < 0.05. Graphpad software instat
(version 2) was used to carry out statistical analysis.
Results
Phytochemical investigation
HRESI-MS/MS analysis of N. alba AEE
The chemical constituents in N. alba AEE were identified
and characterized in both negative and positive ESI
modes. The retention times and fragmentation patterns of
the identified compounds are listed in Table 1. Com-
pounds were tentatively identified based on matching
their masses and fragmentation pattern with the literature
information and ChemSpider. MS fragmentation inter-
pretation is not discussed except when of special interest.
Table 1 outlines 53 compounds, among them 42 hydro-
lysable tannins, three simple phenolic acids, and eight
flavonoids were detected.
Estimation of USM and FAME
Nine hydrocarbons, two sterols and eleven fatty acids were
identified in N. alba AEE. The percentage content of
individual hydrocarbons and fatty acids are summarized in
Tables 2 and 3. The percentage of identified hydrocarbons
was estimated as 94.9% while the sterol content represented
5.03%. n-Tetracosane was determined as the major hydro-
carbon (59.6%), n-tetratriacontane was detected as the
second most abundant hydrocarbon (18.96%) while β-
sitosterol was of significant percentage (3.5%). By compari-
son with the FAME standards, the percentage of the satu-
rated fatty acid represents 49.3% where the major saturated
fatty acid was palmitic acid (40.8%) while the major unsat-
urated fatty acids were linolenic acid (24.5%), linoleic acid
(16.8%) and palmitoleic acid (8.5%).
1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging
activity
AEE showed strong DPPH scavenging activity as indicated
by low IC50 (5.2 ± 0.3 μg/mL) and LC90 (9.1 ± 0.27 μg/mL)
compared with ascorbic acid (12 ± 3.5 μg/mL).
Hepatoprotective activity
Effect of N. alba on liver function parameters
Serum level of liver functions parameters; ALT, AST,
GGT, ALP and total bilirubin were significantly increased
in CCl4-intoxicated rats compared with normal level (P <
0.05; Table 4). Treatment with N. alba (100 and 200 mg/
kg) resulted in significant decrease of ALT, AST, GGT,
ALP and total bilirubin compared with CCl4-intoxicated
rats in a dose dependant manner (P < 0.05; Table 4). Simi-
larly, silymarin significantly improved the liver function
parameters compared with CCl4 group (P < 0.05; Table 4).
Effect of N. alba on oxidant status of the liver
Injection of CCl4 resulted in depletion of hepatic GSH
content (59.7%), decrease in the activities of SOD and
CAT (59.9 and 44.9%, respectively) and decline in TAC of
the liver (65.7%) (P < 0.05; Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively)
compared with control group. Also, CCl4 significantly
increased the liver lipid peroxidation product, MDA
(249.1%) (P < 0.05; Fig. 5) compared with control group.
Treatment of CCl4-intoxicated rats with N. alba (100
and 200 mg/kg) significantly increased the liver content of
GSH (55.1 and 143.4%, respectively; P < 0.05; Fig. 1) com-
pared with the CCl4 group. N. alba (100 and 200 mg/kg)
significantly enhanced the enzymatic activities of both
SOD (79.1 and 111.1%, respectively) and CAT (49.2 and
75.5%, respectively) (P < 0.05; Figs. 2 and 3, respectively)
compared with the CCl4 group. Furthermore, TAC of the
liver increased significantly (84.1 and 173.5%) by treat-
ment with the N. alba (100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively)
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4). On the other hand, treatment with N.
alba (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased liver
MDA content (38.2 and 67.6%), respectively, compared
with the CCl4 group (P < 0.05; Fig. 5).
Silymarin significantly increased the liver GSH content
and TAC (151.7 and 97.3%, respectively) compared with
the CCl4 group (P < 0.05; Figs. 1 and 4, respectively). The
activities of SOD and CAT improved significantly (71 and
73.8%, respectively) by treatment with silymarin compared
with the CCl4 group (P < 0.05; Figs. 2 and 3, respectively).

The hepatic content of MDA decreased significantly
(51.8.7%) compared with the CCl4 group (P < 0.05; Fig. 5).
Effect of N. alba on hepatic content of TNF-α
Hepatic content of TNF-α was significantly increased in
CCl4 group compared with control rats. Treatment with
N. alba (100 and 200 mg/kg) resulted in significant
decrease of TNF-α in a dose dependant manner (Fig. 6).
Silymarin significantly improved the hepatic content of
TNF-α compared with CCl4 control group (Fig. 6).
Histopathological examination of hepatic tissue
Livers excised from a control group showed a normal
architecture of hepatocyte lobules with normal central
and portal areas and normal hepatocytes (Fig. 7a). The
liver samples from CCl4-intoxicated rats showed severe
feathery degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes (Fig. 7b).
The portal area showed severe infiltration by lymphocytes
and dilation of the central vein (Fig. 7c). Rats treated with
low dose of N. alba (100 mg/kg; P.O.) for 5 days showed
slight improvement of the histopathological features of
the liver compared with the CCl4-intoxicated group
(Fig. 7d). However, a high dose of N. alba (200 mg/kg;
P.O.) and silymarin showed marked advances in the liver
features and disappearance of the feathery degeneration of
hepatocytes (Fig. 7e and f, respectively).
Immunohistochemical staining of caspase-3
Liver excised from rats injected with CCl4 showed high
caspase-3 expression (H score = 60; Fig. 8b) while, caspase-
3 was negatively stained in the control group (H score = 0;
Fig. 8a). Caspase-3 expression was decreased in CCl4-intox-
icated rats treated with low dose of N. alba (100 mg/kg; H
score = 20; Fig. 8c). CCl4-intoxicated rats received the high
dose of N. alba as well as those received silymarin (Figs. 8d
and e, respectively) showed negative staining for caspase-3
(H score = 0).
Discussion
The hyphenated HPLC-MS technique is an important
method used for identifying complex mixtures, especially
the phenolics in the crude extracts or the fraction found
in the plant, either by using standard compounds (cochro-
matography) or by comparing mass spectra obtained with
the literature (tentative identification) [22]. A chemical
characteristic of the order Nymphaeals, which includes
the family Nymphaeaceae, is the occurrence of significant
amounts of gallic acid and ellagic acid [23]. Ellagitannins
attracted considerable attention because of their vast
structural diversity and biological activity, including
antioxidant, antiviral and antitumor activity [24, 25].
N. alba flowers and rhizomes are known for their high
phenolic content [9–11], while leaves have never been well
studied before. In this study, N. alba AEE was demon-
strated as a very rich source of phenolic compounds where,
hydrolysable tannins were the main polyphenols identified
(forty-two compounds) distinguished by their characteristic
fragment ion spectra yielding losses of galloyl (m/z 152),
gallate (m/z 170) and esters of hexahydroxydiphenic acid
(HHDP) residues (m/z 302), while the common loss of
44 amu indicates the presence of a free carboxylic group
(COOH) [26, 27].
A total of twenty-six ellagitannins were tentatively
identified. HHDP and a polyol and in some cases, gallic
acid represent the majority of Nymphaea constituents.

Peak 1 with a precursor ion at m/z 481 was identified as
HHDP-glucose [28, 29]. The presence of HHDP was
supported by the formation of m/z 301 in the negative
ionization and 303 in the positive.
Peak 31, shows m/z at 633 [M-H] and fragment ions
at m/z 301 [M-H-152-180], 589 [M-H-44], 481 [M-H-
152] was tentatively identified as a galloyl-HHDP-
glucose (corilagin) isomer, agreeing with Fischer et al.,
[30] and Barros et al. [31]. Peak 32 shows m/z at 783
[M-H] and fragments at m/z 481 [M-H-302] and 301
[M-H-302-180] was identified as pedunculagin (Bis
HHDP hexoside), the release of one HHDP molecule
yielded 481 (peak 1) [32]. Two compounds with m/z 951
were detected at different retention time (Peak 38 and
50) which significantly differ in their fragmentation
pattern, indicating the presence of isomeric structures
which is common with ellagitannins. They were tenta-
tively identified as granatin B and geraniin respectively
[33, 34].
Three lagerstannins previously identified in Lagerstroe-
mia speciosa were tentatively identified with the pres-
ence of gluconic acid. The common loss of 44 amu
indicates the presence of a free carboxylic group [35]. Peak
35 shows m/z at 649 [M-H] and fragments at m/z 603 [M-
H-44], 631 [M-H-18], 469 [M-H-180], 451 [M-H-44-152]
and 301, which was identified as lagerstannin C (galloyl
HHDP-gluconic acid). Peak 9 presents m/z at 799 [M-H]
and fragments at m/z 755 [M-H-44], 497 [M-H-302] and
301 [M-H-302-196] and identified as lagerstannin A (Bis-
HHDP-gluconic acid). Peak 37 shows m/z at 949 [M-H]
and fragments at m/z 647 [M-H-302], 905 [M-H-44], 629
[M-H-44-152], 477 [M-H-302-170], 301 [M-H-302-170-
176]. This peak was tentatively identified as Lagerstannin B
(flavogalloyl-HHDP-gluconic acid) [30, 35].
Analysis of peaks 11, 27, 30 and 47, yielded intense prod-
uct ions resulting from the loss of the HHDP and/or galloyl
moiety. These peaks were tentatively identified as

phyllanthusiin U, B, C and chebulagic acid detected with
[M-H] at m/z 924, 969, 925 and 953, respectively and previ-
ously identified in Phyllanthus urinaria [36, 37]. Peak 28
with a pseudomolecular ion [M-H] at m/z 933.06 and frag-
ment ions at m/z 915, 631, 451 and 301 were in agreement
with the fragmentation pattern attributed to castalagin [38].
The release of one HHDP or ellagic acid moiety (302 Da)
from castalagin generated Peak 33 with an [M-H] at m/z
631, showing the typical ellagic acid fragments at m/z 299
and m/z 271 and tentatively identified as castalin [28, 30].
The free ellagic acid was confirmed by its MS data and
MS/MS fragmentation (peak 5), having m/z at 301 [M-H]
in the negative mode and fragment ions at m/z 275, 257,
247, 229 and 185 [38]. Peaks 17, 48, 49 were tentatively
identified as the glycosylated forms of ellagic acid with
[M-H] at m/z 463, 433 and 447, respectively, showing the
characteristic fragments of ellagic acid at m/z 301 and 275
in addition to the characteristic losses of a hexosyl, pento-
syl and rhamnosyl residue, so, identified as ellagic acid
hexoside, pentoside and rhamnoside respectively [30].
Peak 42 presents m/z at 469 [M-H] and a fragment at m/z
425, was tentatively identified as valoneic acid dilactone, a
compound that often occurs in plants containing
ellagitannins [39]. While peak 12 represented a dimer of
valoneic acid dilactone with [M-H] at m/z 939 and main
fragments at 469 and 425.
Gallic acid and its derivatives were also tentatively
identified where gallic acid appeared at peak 53 while
peak 39 was tentatively identified as dehydrated tergallic
acid with a pseudomolecular ion [M-H] at m/z 613 and

Flavonoids have also been detected where Peak 8
shows m/z at 505 [M-H] and daughter ion at m/z 301
[M-acetyl hexoside], was tentatively identified as quer-
cetin 3-O-acetyl hexoside that was previously identified
in the Nymphaea species [40]. Peak 31 has an [M-H]
ion at m/z 289 and base peak at m/z 245 [M-H-44] was
tentatively identified as catechin or epicatechin by
Pérez-Magariño et al., [41].
Beside the phenolic content N. alba extract appeared
also as rich source of fatty acid. Essential fatty acids (EFAs)
such as linolenic, linoleic and oleic acids help to raise
HDL cholesterol, supporting cardiovascular, reproductive
and immune systems. N. alba extract contains several
essential fatty acids as linoleic (16.78%) and linolenic acid
(24.45%), and, therefore, has a potential nutritional value
in agreement with Eromosele and Eromosele, [42]. In
addition, N. alba provided a rich source of β-sitosterol
(5%), which is reported to reverse the impairment of the
glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio induced by phorbol
esters in macrophage cultures with the increase in manga-
nese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase ac-
tivities and the decrease in catalase activity [43].
Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the development of
the aging process and some chronic diseases [21]. The anti-
oxidant potential of medicinal plants is attributed to the
redox properties of the phenolic compounds and there are
several reports that correlate the total phenolic content to the
antioxidant activity [44–46]. N. alba was shown as a potent
radical scavenger with low IC50 (5.2 ± 0.3 μg/mL) compared
with ascorbic acid. This high radical scavenging activity
suggests the ability of N. alba to reduce oxidative stress.
In this study, the hepatoprotective effect of N. alba AEE
against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity was demonstrated for
the first time in a dose-dependent manner. This protec-
tion was reflected biochemically by the significant im-
provement in serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP and GGT,
indicating the ability of N. alba AEE to protect hepato-
cytes against the deleterious effects of CCl4. Furthermore,
the significant decrease in the serum level of bilirubin
indicated that bilirubin was taken up into the liver as a
function of a healthy hepatocyte. The hepatoprotective
effect of the extract against CCl4-intoxication was further
supported by histopathological examinations which
showed considerable improvement of the histopatho-
logical features of the liver with N. alba treatment.
Silymarin is a unique flavonoid complex that has been re-
ported to possess strong hepatoprotective properties and
commonly used in experiments as a reference hepatopro-
tective substance [47]. Silymarin has a broad array of in
vitro and in vivo activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-
apoptotic and antioxidant [48]. Our results showed that
silymarin protects against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity as
reflected by the significant improvement in the liver en-
zymes and bilirubin as well as enhancement of the histo-
pathological features of the liver which was in agreement to
previous studies [46, 47]. The protective effect of a high
dose of N. alba (200 mg/kg) against hepatotoxicity is com-
parable with the effect observed with silymarin (100 mg/kg)
which indicates a strong hepatoprotective property of the
high dose of N. alba.
Caspase-3 is a protein that plays a vital role in apop-
tosis [49]. In the present study caspase-3 was extensively
expressed in the liver excised from CCl4-intoxicated rats
denoting the correlation between CCl4 induced hepato-
toxicity and the high level of apoptosis of the hepato-
cytes as previously reported [50]. N. alba decreased the
level of caspase-3 expression while the effect of the high
dose of N. alba is similar to that of silymarin as both
drugs showed negative staining for caspase-3. Conse-
quently, the protective effect of N. alba extract against
CCl4 is mediated, in part, by inhibition of apoptosis
through caspase-3 dependant pathway.
Oxidative stress has been shown to play a pivotal role
in liver injury induced by CCl4 [51, 52]. Our results
showed an obvious disturbance in oxidant-antioxidant
balance of the liver subjected to CCl4 where injection of
CCl4 increased the degree of lipid peroxidation as indi-
cated by the significant increase in MDA level in the
liver homogenate. Both non-enzymatic and enzymatic
antioxidant defence mechanisms were deteriorated in
CCl4-injected group. The oxidant-antioxidant status of
the liver excised from CCl4-intoxicated rats was signifi-
cantly improved by treatment with N. alba in a dose-
dependent manner. These findings imply a profound in
vivo antioxidant effect of N. alba. These results are
consistent with the studies documented by Khan and
Sultana, [12, 13], who reported that N. alba extract sup-
presses chemically-induced oxidative stress and kidney
damage in Wistar rats.
The strong antioxidant activity of silymarin has been doc-
umented previously in several studies [47, 48]. In the
present study the antioxidant activity of the high dose of N.
alba is comparable to the antioxidant activity of silymarin.
TNF-α is an important inflammatory mediator that has
been shown to be involved in diverse pathological processes
and in our study, TNF-α is elevated significantly in the CCl4-
intoxicated group, which was previously reported [51, 52].
Treatment with N. alba resulted in a significant decrease in
the hepatic content of TNF-α, which is comparable, in its
high dose, with silymarin. This result indicates a profound
anti-inflammatory effect of N. alba which was in agreement
with that reported in models of acetic acid-induced vascular
permeability and cotton pellet-induced granuloma. In both
models, N. alba exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect in a
dose-dependent manner, which can be comparable with that
of diclofenac sodium [6].

Conclusion
The results highlight the high phenolic content of N. alba
leaves, denoting the predominance of hydrolysable tannins,
mainly ellagitannins, in addition to the flavonoid content of
major antioxidant activity. N. alba also appeared as a rich
source of essential fatty acid with high nutritional value.
Administration of N. alba extract remarkably protected
against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity to an extent compar-
able with silymarin. The suppression of oxidative stress and
the inhibition of a crucial pro-inflammatory mediator such
as TNF-α might be the possible mechanisms for the
hepatoprotective activity of N. alba that help in restoration
of the physiological and histological features of the liver.
This preclinical study provides convincing evidence that N.
alba extract can control inflammatory and oxidative stress-
related liver diseases.
