The aim of this work was to advance in the knowledge on thebioavailability of the secoiridoids present in a Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl seed/fruit extract usingboth targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses. Plasma and urine samples from nine healthyvolunteers were taken at specific time intervals following the intake of the extract and analyzedby UPLC-ESI-QTOF. Predicted metabolites such as tyrosol and ligstroside-aglycone glucuronidesand sulfates were detected at low intensity. These compounds reached peak plasma levels 2 hafter the intake and exhibited high variability among the participants. The ligstroside-aglyconeconjugates may be considered as potential biomarkers of the Fraxinus secoiridoids intake. Usingthe untargeted approach we additionally detected phenolic conjugates identified as ferulic acid andcaffeic acid sulfates, as well as hydroxybenzyl and hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde sulfate derivativeswhich support further metabolism of the secoiridoids by phase I and (or) microbial enzymes.Overall, the results of this study suggest low uptake of intact secoiridoids from a Fraxinus angustifoliaVahl extract in healthy human volunteers and metabolic conversion by esterases, glycosidases, andphase II sulfo- and glucuronosyl transferases to form smaller conjugated derivatives.Keywords: tyrosol; ligstroside-aglycone; UPLC-ESI-QTOF; absorption; metabolism; phase IIconjugation1. IntroductionThe genus Fraxinus (Oleaceae) which contains a wide range of phytochemicals, mostlysecoiridoid glucosides, coumarins and phenylethanoids, but also some flavonoids, benzoquinones,Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219; doi:10.3390/molecules201219845 www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219indole derivatives and simple phenolics has been commonly used in traditional medicine againstvarious inflammatory diseases, infections, constipation, as a diuretic and as a hepatoprotectiveagent [1]. Additionally, an extract produced from the seeds/fruits of Fraxinus has been shown tomoderate body weight gain, body fat, glucose and insulin levels, fatty liver incidence as well as bloodpressure in various animal models of obesity, diabetes and hypertension [2–5] supporting potentialbeneficial properties of Fraxinus against metabolic disorders. These beneficial effects were observedwith doses ranging between 100 and 200 mg per kg of body weight per day, corresponding to aHuman Equivalent Dose (HED = animal dose in mg/kg ˆ (animal weight in kg/human weightin kg)0.33) of ~1.0 g/day for a 60 kg person. Notably, the acute administration of 1 g of the Fraxinusextract first evidenced the reduction of glycemia in healthy humans [6] and the daily administrationof 1 g of the Fraxinus extract for three weeks in elderly overweight/obese subjects resulted in asignificantly lower incremental glucose area under the curve, lower 2 h blood glucose levels andmodified levels of fructosamine and adiponectin:leptin ratio [7]. This Fraxinus extract, preparedusing a patented extraction protocol [8], was reported to contain a standardized amount (~10%) ofthe secoiridoid glycoside nuzhenide (CAS registry number 60037-39-0) plus the dimeric secoiridoidglycoside GL3 (glycosylated esters of tyrosol and elenolic acid; CAS registry number 39011-92-2)(Figure 1). These two compounds were shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptoralpha (PPARα) and to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in cultured adipocytes providing a potentialmolecular mechanism underlying the metabolic regulatory activity of the Fraxinus extract [9]. Thesesecoiridoids have thus been proposed as the main bioactive constituents of the extract potentiallyresponsible for its beneficial effects [4,6,9] but the biological effects of these compounds within theorganism depend largely on their metabolism and uptake from the gastrointestinal tract.Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 2 diseases, infections, constipation, as a diuretic and as a hepatoprotective agent [1]. Additionally,  an extract produced from the seeds/fruits of Fraxinus has been shown to moderate body weight gain, body fat, glucose and insulin levels, fatty liver incidence as well as blood pressure in various animal models of obesity, diabetes and hypertension [2–5] supporting potential beneficial properties of Fraxinus against metabolic disorders. These beneficial effects were observed with doses ranging between 100 and 200 mg per kg of b dy weight per day, corresponding to a Human Equivalent Dose (HED = animal dose in mg/kg × (animal weight in kg/human weight in kg)0.33) of ~1.0 g/day for a 60 kg person. Notably, the acute administration of 1 g of the Fraxinus extract first evidenced the reduction of glycemia in healthy humans [6] and the daily administration of 1 g of the Fraxinus extract for three weeks in elderly overweight/obese subjects resulted in a significantly lower incremental glucose area under the curve, lower 2 h blood glucose levels and modified levels of fructosamine and adiponectin:leptin ratio [7]. This Fraxinus extract, prepared using a patented extraction protocol [8], was reported to contain a standardized amount (~10%) of the secoiridoid glycoside nuzhenide (CAS registry number 60037-39-0) plus the dimeric ecoiridoid glyc side GL3 (glycosylate  esters of tyrosol a d elenolic acid; CAS registry number 39011-92-2) (Figure 1). These two compounds were shown to ac ivate peroxisom  proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in cultured adipocytes providing a potential molecular mechanism underlying the metabolic regulatory activity of the Fraxinus extract [9]. These secoiridoids have thus been proposed as the main bioactive constituents of the extract potentially responsible for its beneficial effects [4,6,9] but the biological effects of these compounds within the organism depend largely on their metabolism and uptake from the gastrointestinal tract.

The characterization of in vivo circulating metabolites derived from the intake of plant dietaryphytochemicals remains an essential step for the identification of the actual bioactive moleculesand for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of these plantcompounds. However, unravelling the metabolic conversion of plant dietary bioactive compoundsand identifying their derived metabolites in humans remains an intricate and challenging task.Metabolomics study global changes in the entire metabolite set of certain cells, tissues, organs andorganisms. It combines strategies to identify and quantify metabolites using sophisticated analyticaltechnologies (different chromatographic separation techniques, such as liquid or gas chromatographycoupled to mass spectrometry detection system) with the application of statistical and multi-variatemethods for the extraction of information and data interpretation. The application of metabolomicsin food systems (called as “food metabolomics” or “foodomics”) is a very powerful technology tofurther progress in the elucidation and understanding of the metabolism and absorption of dietarycompounds [17]. By providing highly sensitive and specific metabolic profiles in body fluids andtissues, it allows for the identification of potential bioactive metabolites and biomarkers of exposureto diet compounds [18]. Two ways of identifying metabolites have been developed: (i) the targetedapproach which involves the selection of specific candidates that are likely to appear in the biologicalsamples [19] and (ii) the untargeted approach that uses advanced analytical tools to extract unknowninformation of the metabolome from large data sets [20–22].The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the metabolic fate of the main secoiridoidspresent in a Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl seed/fruit extract in a group of healthy volunteers. Usingan UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS, we searched for specific anticipated metabolites (targeted metabolomics)as well as for other non-predicted metabolites (untargeted metabolomics) that appear in the urineand plasma of the volunteers following the consumption of 1 g of the extract.2. Results and Discussion2.1. Fraxinus Extract Content in SecoiridoidsThe UV chromatographic profile of the phenolic compounds extracted from theFraxinus angustifolia extract used in this study is shown in Figure 2. We confirmed that the twomajor polyphenolic components, the secoiridoid glucosides nuzhenide (peak 8) and GL3 (peak 15),were present and amounted up to 5.92% ˘ 0.14% and 4.75% ˘ 0.09%, respectively (total quantity:10.67% ˘ 0.23%). Various other compounds were also detected in the extract based on their mass[M ´ H]´, the MS/MS fragmentation pattern and data available in the literature (Table 1) [1,4].Most of them were secoiridoid glucosides such as salidroside, oleoside, oleoside-11-methyl ester,glucosylformoside, excelside B, GL5 and other isomers of nuzhenide and GL3. These compoundscontain as part of their molecular structure: tyrosol (4-hydroxyphenyl ethylalcohol), elenolic acidand (or) elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (ligstroside-aglycone) (Figure 1). Other secoiridoids likenuzhenide 11-methyl oleoside (isomer of GL3) and nuzhenide di(11-methyloleoside), previouslydescribed in olive seeds [23], were first time tentatively identified in the Fraxinus extract.We also detected various compounds displaying a UV spectrum similar to that typical ofhydroxycinnamic acid as well as verbascoside (ester of hydroxytyrosol, caffeic acid and the sugarα-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-3)-β-D-glucopyranose).To understand the potential metabolic effects of the compounds present in the Fraxinus extractwe need to determine their bioavailability and thus, we next investigated the bioavailability of themain secoiridoid glucosides identified in the extract using a targeted approach.22204Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 4  Figure 2.

Fraxinus Extract Derived Specific Plasma and Urine Metabolites: Targeted AnalysisThe targeted approach involves searching for a selection of predicted metabolites that are likelyto appear in plasma and urine. Although scarce, data about absorption and metabolism of oleuropein,a secoiridoid glycoside (ester of hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid linked to glucose) present in oliveleaf extracts, were useful to develop the targeted analysis. It has been reported that oleuropeinwas absorbed in very small quantities as such and also conjugated as glucuronide [13,14,24].The predominant circulating metabolites were oleuropein-aglycone derivatives and the conjugates(glucuronide, sulfate and methylated) of hydroxytyrosol suggesting extensive hydrolysis andphase II conjugation of the parent compound [13–16]. Similar metabolites were observed afterthe intake of olive oil, a foodstuff rich in oleuropein-aglycone [10,11]. Based on these results, wespecifically searched for a range of metabolites (Supplementary Table S1) covering the parent originalcompounds, their aglycones, a number of potential fragments and the corresponding phase IIderivatives of all of them. None of the secoiridoid glucosides present in the Fraxinus extract weredetected in the urine and plasma samples indicating that the parent original compounds may not bedirectly absorbed and must undergo some metabolic conversion. Similarly to the case of oleuropein,we found that the main circulating metabolites following the intake of the Fraxinus extract werethe conjugates of the hydrolysis products of the parent compounds: a glucuronide and two sulfateconjugates of tyrosol as well as a glucuronide and a sulfate conjugate of the ligstroside-aglycone(Table 2). The molecular formulae of these metabolites were obtained with high score (>91) andlow error (<3.8 ppm). MS/MS spectra of tyrosol conjugates showed a characteristic fragment atm/z 137.0606 indicative of a tyrosol moiety while a fragment ion at m/z 361.1288 representativeof a ligstroside-aglycone moiety appeared in the ligstroside-aglycone conjugates. Fragments atm/z 79.9574 and 175.0246 were indicative of sulfate and glucuronic acid moiety respectively.Table 2.

This hydrolysismight be mediated by the host and (or) microbial glycosidases and (or) esterases [25,26] followed byphase II glucuronidation or sulfation of the aglycone molecules. The extracted ion chromatograms(EICs) of the four metabolites in plasma samples at time 0 and 2 h and in urine samples at 0 and 8 hare further illustrated in Figure 3.Since standards for these compounds were not available, we were not able to accurately quantifythe levels of the detected metabolites. However, using relative peak areas (relative area = (peak areametaboliteˆ 100/peak area IS)) we were able to plot the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic behaviorof each metabolite. Compounds identified in urine were quantified after adjustment for the volumeof urine produced. The absorption-time profiles in plasma and excretion-time profiles in urine foreach metabolite are shown in Figures 4a and 5a, respectively (mean values ˘ SD).22206Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 6  Figure 3.

Our results evidenced that the secoiridoid metabolites derived from the Fraxinus angustifolia extract reached their maximum levels in plasma 2 h after the intake, i.e., slightly delayed in comparison with the maximum peak concentration for hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein conjugates (within the 35–75 min post-ingestion of olive leaf extract) [13,16]. The tyrosol sulfates were still detected in plasma at 24 h whereas the ligstroside-aglycone sulfate was not detected any longer after 4 h. In urine, all the metabolites examined were detected mostly at 8 h after the intake of the extract, similarly to the excretion of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein conjugates [13,16]. Some metabolites, especially those Figure 5. (a) Urine concentration-time courses of the targeted metabolites detected.

The tyrosol sulfates were stilldetected in plasma at 24 h whereas the ligstroside-aglycone sulfate was not detected any longer after4 h. In urine, all the metabolites examined were detected mostly at 8 h after the intake of the extract,similarly to the excretion of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein conjugates [13,16]. Some metabolites,22209Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219especially those derived from tyrosol, continued appearing at 24 h. As it is the case for otherdietary polyphenols [27], the levels of all the examined metabolites exhibited a high inter-individualvariability as depicted in Figures 4b and 5b (individual values for each 2 h-plasma and 8 h-urinemetabolite after the intake of the Fraxinus extract, respectively). Differences between the maximumand minimum levels of metabolites were up to 18-fold and 15-fold in plasma and 19-fold and 10-foldin urine for tyrosol glucuronide and ligstroside-aglycone glucuronide, respectively. Generally, thetranslation of beneficial metabolic effects of dietary polyphenols from pre-clinical animal modelsto human intervention studies has shown inconsistent evidences possibly and partly due to thevariability in the metabolism and uptake of these compounds [28]. In the case of the Fraxinus extractwhich has been shown to moderate fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels in rodent modelsof obesity, intervention in obese and overweight subjects resulted in 2 h-blood glucose improvementfollowing an oral glucose tolerance test but not significant differences for FBG and insulin levelswere observed [7]. Small sample size and variability in the capacity of each volunteer to absorb andmetabolize the secoiridoids from the Fraxinus extract may contribute to explain the lack of currentsignificant mean effects in humans for those two metabolic biomarkers. Other factors such as gendercan influence the bioavailability of the secoiridoids as previously suggested for olive leaf extracts [13]but a difference between male and female was not apparent in this study. The variability in thebioavailability of the secoiridoids from the Fraxinus extract and the factors affecting it needs to befurther and critically assessed.2.3. Untargeted Approach to Study Non-Predicted Secoiridoid Metabolites Appearing in Plasma andUrine SamplesWe further explored the appearance of other non-predicted potential metabolites directlyderived from the metabolic transformation of the secoiridoids in the plasma and urine samples ofthe volunteers following the intake of the Fraxinus extract using an untargeted strategy that enablesthe extraction of the required information from large data sets. Between 600 and 800 peaks in theplasma samples and 500 and 2000 peaks in the urine samples were extracted by chromatographicdeconvolution. After alignment based on mass accuracy and retention time, 2360 unique entities inplasma and 6216 in urine were identified. Filtering by frequency (data present in at least 50% ofthe volunteers in at least one time-point) reduced the number of molecular features (MFs) to 681 inplasma and 1243 in urine. The filtered features were then compared between the baseline samplesand the different time-points examined using one-way ANOVA yielding a total of 98 significantlydifferent features in plasma and 336 in urine (p < 0.05, fold-change cut-off = 2.0). Unsupervised PCAwas used to visualize these results into six well-discriminated groups in plasma (Figure 6a) and threegroups in urine (Figure 6b). The baseline samples resulted clearly separated from those samples takenat the different time-points.Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 9 derived from tyrosol, continued appearing at 24 h. As it is the case for other dietary polyphenols [27], the levels of all the examined metabolites exhibited a high inter-individual variability as depicted in Figures 4b and 5b (individual values for each 2 h-plasma and 8 h-urine metabolite after the intake of the Fraxinus extract, respectively). Differences between the maximum and minimum levels of metabolites were up to 18-fold and 15-fold in plasma and 19-fold and 10-fold in urine for tyrosol glucuronide and ligstroside-aglycone glucuronide, respectively. Generally, th  translation of beneficial metabolic effects of dietary polyphenols from pre-clinical animal models to human intervention studies has shown inconsistent evidences possibly and partly due to the variability in the metabolism and uptake of these compounds [28]. In the case of the Fraxinus extract which has been shown to moderate fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels in rodent models of obesity, intervention in obese and overw ight subjects resulted in 2 h-blood glucose improvement following an oral glucose tolerance test but not significant differences for FBG and insulin levels were observed [7]. Small sample size and variability in the capacity of each volunteer to absorb and metabolize the secoiridoids from the Fraxinus extract may contribute to explain the lack of current significant mean effects in humans for those two metabolic biomarkers. Other factors such as gender can influence the bioavailability of the secoiridoids as previously suggested for olive leaf extracts [13] but a difference between male and female was not apparent in this study. The variability in the bioavailability of the secoiridoids from the Fraxinus extract and the factors affecting it needs to be further and critically assessed. 2.3. Untargeted Approach to Study Non-Predicted Secoiridoid Metabolites Appearing in Plasma and  Urine Samples We further explored the appearance of other non-predicted potential metabolites directly derived from the metabolic transformation of the secoiridoids in the plasma and urine samples of the volunteers foll wing th  intake of the Fraxinus extract u ing an untargeted strategy that enables the extraction of the required information from large data sets. Between 600 and 800 peaks in the plasma samples and 500 and 2000 peaks in the urine samples were extracted by chromatographic deconvolution. After alignment based on mass accuracy and retention time, 2360 unique entities in plasma and 6216 in urine were identified. Filtering by frequency (data present in at least 50% of the volunteers in at least one time-point) reduced the numb r of molecular features (MFs) to 681 in plasma and 1243 in urine. The filt red features were then compared between the baseline s mples and the different time- oints examined using one-way ANOVA yielding a total of 98 significantly different features in plasma and 336 in urine (p < 0.05, fold-change cut-off = 2.0). Unsupervised PCA was used to visualize these results into six well-discriminated groups in plasma (Figure 6a) and three groups in urine (Figure 6b). The baseline samples resulted clearly separated from those samples taken at the different time-points.  Figure 6. Cont. Figure 6. Cont.22210Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 10  Figure 6. Principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot of the plasma (a) and urine (b) samples of nine volunteers analyzed at baseline (control) and at different time-points after the intake of the Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl extract. The metabolites responsible for the discrimination of these time-points groups may be: (i) of exogenous origin, i.e., resulting from the absorption and metabolism of Fraxinus compounds but also from other compounds taken with the diet and (ii) of endogenous origin, i.e., metabolites that could be altered by the intake of the Fraxinus extract [20]. We concentrated our efforts towards the identification of those metabolites that were significantly increased following the ingestion of the extract and that may derive directly from the secoiridoids present in it. A total of 50 MFs in the plasma samples and  52 MFs in the urine samples were found consistently at higher levels in the post-ingestion samples than in the baseline samples. Using their exact mass and MS/MS fragments we were able to tentatively identify seven compounds in the plasma and four compounds in the urine (Table 3) that showed high p(corr) values. Tyrosol sulfate in plasma and ligstroside-aglycone glucuronide both in plasma and urine, previously detected in the targeted analysis, were confirmed as significantly different offering partial validation of the untargeted approach. These results support that ligstroside-aglycone glucuronide may constitute a good candidate as a “biomarker of intake” for the Fraxinus extract since this metabolite is specifically originated from the secoiridoids present in the extract, was not present in the urine and plasma samples at baseline and was identified as one of the MFs that contribute to differentiate between the post ingestion time-point samples and the baseline samples (p(corr) = 0.00275 in plasma and 0.0108 in urine). We additionally detected the phenolic derivatives, ferulic acid and caffeic acid sulfate. Further, and in support of microbial metabolism of the Fraxinus secoiridoids, we were able to detect a significant rise in plasma and/or urine of the sulfate conjugates of the microbial metabolites 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). These metabolites may result from the fermentation of tyrosol and (or) hydroxytyrosol by fecal microbial metabolism [29,30]. These metabolites may derive from the fermentation of different dietary polyphenols and thus we cannot unequivocally relate them to the intake of the Fraxinus secoiridoids. The main objective of this study was to contribute to identify some of the metabolites circulating in vivo in humans following the intake of a Fraxinus angustifolia extract and that could be potentially involved in the metabolic regulatory effects attributed to this natural extract. We acknowledge that this is a preliminary study with a small number of volunteers and that future studies should include a larger number of participants to account for the variability in the human absorption and metabolism of plant bioactive compounds. Nevertheless we have shown that tyrosol conjugates constitute some of the main metabolites circulating in plasma after the intake of the extract. Since it has been reported that tyrosol moderates the levels of blood glucose and insulin in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [31] it is possible that the tyrosol conjugates may be partially involved in the glycemic regulatory effects associated with the consumption of the Fraxinus extract [2–4,6,7].Figure 6. Principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot of the plasma (a) and urine (b) samplesof nine volunteers analyzed at baseline (control) and at different time-points after the intake of theFraxinus angustifolia Vahl extract.The metabolites responsible for the discrimination of these time-points groups may be:(i) of exogenous origin, i.e., resulti g from the absorption and metabolism of Fraxinus compoundsbut also from oth r c mpounds take with the diet and (ii) of e doge us origin, i.e., metabolitesthat could be altered by the intake of the Fraxinus extract [20].

Tyrosol sulfate in plasma and ligstroside-aglyconeglucuronide both in plasma and urine, previously detected in the targeted analysis, were confirmedas significantly different offeri g partial validatio of the untargeted a proach. These results supportthat ligstroside-aglycone glucuronide may constitute a good candidate as a “biomarker of intake” forthe Fraxinus extract since this metabolite is specifically originated from the secoiridoids present in theextract, was not present in the urine and plasma samples at baseline and was identified as one of theMFs that contribute to differentiate between e post ingestion time-p int samples and the baselinesamples (p(c rr) = 0.00275 in plasma and 0.0108 in urine). We additionally et cted the phenolicderivatives, ferulic acid and caffeic acid sulfate. Further, and in support of microbial metabolism ofthe Fraxinus secoiridoids, we were able to detect a significant rise in plasma and/or urine of the sulfateconjugates of the microbial metabolites 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). These metabolites may result from the fermentation oftyrosol and (or) hydroxytyrosol by fecal microbial metabolism [29,30].

It is widely known that the food matrix canhave a critical impact on the bioavailability of polyphenols [32] and thus, it is plausible that otherconstituents present in the Fraxinus extract such as complex carbohydrates and proteins [8] may affectthe absorption of the secoiridoids. We further hypothesize that the secoiridoids may exert some oftheir metabolic effects at the intestinal level, by modifying the microbiota composition and/or byinteracting with the intestinal barrier [28,33]. We cannot discard either that the other constituentsof the extract can contribute to the metabolic benefits of Fraxinus. These issues require furtherinvestigation and point towards a potential prebiotic effect of the Fraxinus extract.3. Experimental Section3.1. ChemicalsPure standards of nuzhenide and GL3 were synthetized and sent to us by Naturex S.A. (Avignon,France). Stock solutions of both compounds were prepared in water (2000 ppm) and standardmixtures were diluted in methanol (MeOH)/water (50/50, v/v) to a final concentration of 500 ppm.Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in MeOH (5000 ppm) and used asinternal standard (IS). MeOH and acetonitrile were from J. T. Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands) andformic acid and HCl were from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). All other chemicals and reagents wereof analytical grade. Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) ultrapure water was usedthroughout the study.3.2. Fraxinus Extract CharacterizationThe raw material used for the extract preparation was previously identified using a high pressurethin-layer chromatographic method and reported as Fraxinus excelsior L. (common ash) [2–4,6–9]. Thewhole aerial part of the plant containing the seeds has been now re-evaluated combining macroscopicanalyses, high pressure thin layer chromatography (HPTLC, CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland) andDNA techniques (these analyses were conducted by Ms. Mélissa Feuillatre, Naturex botanist, usingauthenticated DNA Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl fruit as the botanical reference). Further DNA-basedauthentication by two independent laboratories (AuthenTechnologies LLC, Richmond, CA, USA andDNA Gensee, Le Bourget du Lac, France) has confirmed that the plant material belongs to the specieFraxinus angustifolia Vahl (narrow-leaved ash). The fruits of Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl were collectedfrom the Demnat region in central Morocco (by Mr. Ahmed Sghir, Agricultural Engineer). Thecorresponding voucher was assigned the voucher specimen identifier 1HAB0044#B020/019/A14;Reference AU100815) and is deposited at Naturex Avignon (Avignon, France).The F. angustifolia extract used in this study was prepared from the seeds and fruits, encapsulated(334 mg per capsule) and kindly supplied by Naturex S.A. (Avignon, France, product code EA149251).The full composition of the extract has been previously reported [8]. Briefly, the extract contains ahigh proportion of carbohydrates (72.4 g/100 g) and small quantities of protein and total dietaryfiber (approximately 6 g/100 g each). It also contains relatively high concentrations of glucose andsucrose (3.34 and 3.84 g/100 g, respectively). The extract was standardized to contain approximately10 % of the secoiridoids, nuzhenide and GL3 using the extraction process described in the patentUS 8293292 [34].The specific phenolic composition of the extract used in this study was monitored usingan HPLC-DAD-MS/MS (IT) system. The Fraxinus extract (20 mg) was dissolved with 1 mL ofMeOH/H2O (50/50, v/v), vortexed for 2 min and ultrasonicated for 10 min prior to centrifugationat 3500ˆ g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered (0.45 µm PVDF) before injection. Analyseswere carried out on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array detectorand an ion-trap mass spectrometer detector in series (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).22213Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219The separation of phenolic compounds was achieved on a reverse phase LiChroCART C-18 column(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (250 ˆ 4 mm, 4.5 µm particle size), operating at room temperatureand a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. A sample volume of 10 µL was injected. The mobile phases usedwere water with formic acid (1%) (phase A) and acetonitrile (phase B) and the solvent gradient wasas follows: 0 min, 1% B, 0 to 10 min, 1%–9% B; 10 to 48 min, 9%–35% B; 48 to 52 min, 35%–95% B;52 to 54 min, 95%–1% B and maintained at 1 % for 6 min (total run = 60 min). The UV-Vis spectra wereacquired in the range of 200 to 600 nm. Compounds were monitored at 260 nm. Nitrogen was usedas drying and nebulising gas in the electrospray interface (ESI) with pressure at 65 psi, flow 11 L/minand temperature 350 ˝C. MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded in negative mode in the range ofm/z 100–1500 with target mass of 700. Identification of compounds was carried out by their spectralproperties, molecular mass and literature information. The calibration curves of nuzhenide and GL3were constructed from 1 ppm to 500 ppm in MeOH/water (50/50, v/v).3.3. Human Intervention StudyThis pilot study was conducted conformed to ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration ofHelsinki and its amendments and was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of the CatholicUniversity of San Antonio (Murcia, Spain). Prior to their participation, the volunteers were informedof the background, objectives, methodology, risks of the intervention, as well as of the type of resultsand benefits expected and gave written informed consent. Inclusion criteria were as follows: young(20–25 year old) healthy men and women (body mass index, BMI < 30 kg/m2), non-smoker andnon-alcohol consumers (ď30 g/day), with no-abnormal dietary habits or vitamin supplementation.Participants were excluded if they were taking medication and/or had consumed antibiotics for3 months prior to the intervention, or if they suffered from any hemostatic or metabolic disturbances,gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular diseases, or any other chronic disease. The only dietarysource known to contain some secoiridoids (mostly oleuropein, ligstroside and hydroxytyrosol [13])is olives and derived products, such as olive oil. Since it has been reported that olive metabolites areeliminated well within 24 h [13], the volunteers were instructed to avoid all olive products during thethree days previous to the study. Volunteers gathered in a room specifically designed for this purposefor the duration of the intervention. A total of nine volunteers completed the study. This sample sizeis comparable to previous studies in the field [11,13,20,22]. The characteristics of the participants aresummarized in Table 4.Table 4. Summary of the demographic and anthropomorphic characteristics of the volunteers takingpart in the study.

Blood (5 mL) was collected into heparinized tubesfrom the antecubital arm vein: one sample at baseline (8.00 a.m. before Fraxinus intake, control) andseveral samples at predetermined time points (1, 2, 4, and 8 h) following a single acute dose of theFraxinus extract in hard capsules (3 ˆ 334 mg) with a glass of water. This dose was chosen accordingto that used in previous animal and human studies [2–7] reporting some metabolic beneficial effects.The volunteers were asked to come back the following morning (8.00 a.m. before breakfast) for afurther 24 h blood sample extraction. Blood samples were centrifuged (3000ˆ g, 15 min) and plasmawas frozen prior to metabolites analysis. The participants were also given special containers for22214Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–22219urine collection. They collected three urine samples: at baseline (taken the morning of the studybefore Fraxinus intake) as well as the urine produced during the following 8 and 24 h after theextract consumption. Total urine volume was measured and all urine samples were frozen untilfurther analysis.Molecules 2015, 20, page–page 14  Figure 7. Experimental design and sampling protocol. 3.4. Urine and Plasma Samples Preparation Urine samples were thawed, rapidly vortexed to homogenize the sample, then centrifuged at 14,000× g for 10 min and filtered (0.45 μm PVDF). Prior to injection, the samples were diluted (1:5) with acidified water (0.1% formic acid). Plasma samples were thawed and 200 μL mixed and extracted with 600 μL ACN:formic acid (99.8:0.2, v/v) by vortexing for 2 min followed by ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000× g for 10 min and the supernatant was reduced to dryness in a speed vacuum concentrator. The dried samples were re-suspended in 200 μL of MeOH/water (50/50, v/v) plus 0.1% formic acid and filtered (0.45 μm PVDF filter) prior to analysis. Quercetin (IS) was added just before injection of both types of samples (final concentration 0.5 ppm). 3.5. UPLC-ESI-QTOF MS Analysis of Plasma and Urine Samples The analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system coupled to the 6550 Accurate-Mass QTOF (Agilent Tecnologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with electrospray interface (Jet Stream Technology). Samples were injected (2 μL) on a reverse phase Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (3 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) (Agilent Tecnologies) operating at 30 °C and a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The mobile phases used were acidified water (0.1% formic acid) (Phase A) and acidified ACN (0.1% formic acid) (Phase B). Compounds were separated using the following gradient conditions: 0–10 min,  1%–18% phase-B; 10–16 min, 18%–38% phase-B; 16–22 min, 38%–95% phase-B. Finally, the phase B content was returned to the initial conditions (1%) in 1 min and the column re-equilibrated for 5 min. The best conditions for the electrospray interface were: gas temperature 280 °C, drying gas 9 L/min, nebulizer 35 psi, sheath gas temperature 400 °C, sheath gas flow 12 L/min. Spectra were acquired in the range 100–1100 m/z in negative mode, fragmentor was 100 V and acquisition rate 1.5 spectra/s. Targeted MS/MS analyses were developed to add confidence to compound identification. MS/MS product ion spectra were collected at an m/z range of 50–800 using a retention time window of 1 min, an isolation window of 4.0 amu, collision energy of 20 V and an acquisition rate of 4 spectra/s. To assure the desired mass accuracy of recorded ions, continuous internal calibration was performed during analyses with the use of signals m/z 112.9855 (detected m/z [C2O2F3 − H]−) and 1033.9881 (detected m/z [C18H18O6N3P3F24 + TFA-H]−). Data were processed using the Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.06.00, Agilent Technologies). Two strategies were applied for the identification of metabolites: targeted and untargeted analysis. 3.5.1. Targeted Metabolomics Analysis The target screening strategy consists of searching for a list of predicted compounds after MS full acquisition. The list was created taking into account the information available in the literature about the absorption and metabolism of other secoiridoids [13,16] or other families of phenolic compounds [35]. We first searched for the presence of the compounds originally found in the extracts (mainly secoiridoids glucosides) (Figure 1 and Table 1) as well as possible compounds that may derive from the hydrolysis of these glucosides, especially those that may be released by the action of glycosidases, Figure 7.

Data were processed using the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.06.00, Agilent Technologies). Two strategies wereapplied for the identification of metabolites: targeted and untargeted analysis.22215Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–222193.5.1. Targeted Metabolomics AnalysisThe target screening strategy consists of searching for a list of predicted compounds after MSfull acquisition. The list was created taking into account the information available in the literatureabout the absorption and metabolism of other secoiridoids [13,16] or other families of phenoliccompounds [35]. We first searched for the presence of the compounds originally found in the extracts(mainly secoiridoids glucosides) (Figure 1 and Table 1) as well as possible compounds that mayderive from the hydrolysis of these glucosides, especially those that may be released by the actionof glycosidases, i.e., tyrosol and ligstroside-aglycone (Figure 1). We then searched for the presenceof compounds potentially derived from the metabolic transformation of the parent glucosides andaglycone fragments. We specifically searched for phase I and phase II conjugates (glucuronide,sulfate, sulfoglucuronide, methyl-derivatives and hydroxylated derivatives) of all the compounds.The complete list of the investigated metabolites, molecular formula and exact mass is included inSupplementary Table S1. Screening was based on mass filtering at the exact mass of the metaboliteinvestigated using narrow mass extraction windows (0.01 m/z). The identification was possible withthe support of the information attained in the QTOF-MS acquisition mode that provides potentialmolecular formulae for the compounds based on the accurate mass and isotopic pattern.3.5.2. Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis StepsTo explore the potential presence in plasma and urine samples of other non-anticipatedmetabolites derived from the metabolic transformation of the secoiridoids, we developed andapplied an untargeted metabolomics approach. To cope with the complexity of the results obtainedby UPLC-QTOF measurements, date pre-processing and statistical analyses were implemented.Initial data processing was carried out using the Molecular Feature Extraction (MFE) algorithm.Ions were extracted as molecular features (MFs) characterized by retention time, intensity of thechromatographic peak and accurate mass. For the extraction procedure (both in plasma and urinesamples), the minimum absolute abundance was set at 5000 counts and the minimum number ofions at 2. Further, the m/z range was between 100 and 1500 and the time range between 0.5 and20 min. Data files in compound exchange format (.cef files) were created for each sample and exportedinto the Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) software package (version B.12.01, Agilent Technologies,Santa Clara, CA, USA) for further processing. Alignment of retention time and m/z values wascarried out across the samples using a tolerance window of 0.2 min and 15 ppm of the observedm/z + 2 mDa. To reduce the dimensionality of the data prior to statistical analyses and to focuson the objective of the analysis, all the MFs that were not present in at least 50% of the samples(volunteers) in at least one group (time-point after the FXE intake) were removed. Only those featurespresent in 5 out of 9 volunteers in at least one time were analyzed. Using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05,Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction) and a fold-change cut-offof 2.0 we generated a list of compounds that differed significantly between groups (time-points).The final list of selected ions was subjected to unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA)to visualize differences in metabolite profiles at different times after the intake of FXE. Since thisstudy was mainly focused on the search for metabolites potentially derived from the secoiridoids,all the metabolites with peak intensity higher in the control than after the ingestion (down-regulated)were not considered. Determination of the molecular formula and tentative identification of the restof compounds (up-regulated) was carried out using accurate mass measurement of full single MSspectra and additional information obtained by MS/MS analyses. These data were compared tothose registered in various databases such as METLIN, KEGG LIGAND and Human MetabolomeDatabase (HMD).22216Molecules 2015, 20, 22202–222194. ConclusionsIn this study we have applied targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approaches to determineabsorbed metabolites following acute ingestion of a Fraxinus angustifolia seed/fruit extract inhuman healthy volunteers. LC-QTOF MS analyses of urine and plasma samples revealed limitedbioavailability of the intact secoiridoids present in the extract and further metabolism by glycosidases,esterases and phase II conjugation enzymes to form mostly tyrosol and ligstroside-aglyconeconjugates. The ligstroside-aglycone conjugates may constitute a good biomarker of exposure to theFraxinus extract. The appearance in plasma and urine of some phenolic derivatives suggest additionalmetabolism by phase I and (or) microbial enzymes. Further studies are needed to clarify the metabolicconversion of secoiridoids from Fraxinus and to advance the knowledge of its metabolic benefits andmechanisms of action.Supplementary Materials: Supplementary materials can be accessed at: http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/20/12/19845/s1.Acknowledgments: This work was financially supported by the Centre for the Development of IndustrialTechnology (CDTI) from the Spanish Government (NEMAF project) and R.G.V., P.F-B. and M-T.G.C. areparticipating to the COST Action FA1403 Positive (Interindividual variation in response to consumption of plantfood bioactives and determinants involved).
