Hypericum perforatum L. is a medicinal plant considered as an important natural source of secondary metabolites with a wide
range of pharmacological attributes. Hairy roots (HR) were induced from root segments of in vitro grown seedlings from H.
perforatum after cocultivation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4. Investigations have been made to study the production of
phenolic compounds in dark-grown (HR1) and photoperiod-exposed (HR2) cultures. The chromatographic analysis of phenolic
acids, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and xanthones revealed marked differences between HR1 and HR2 cultures. The production of
quinic acid, kaempferol, and seven identified xanthones was increased in HR2. Moreover, HR2 showed a capability for de novo
biosynthesis of two phenolic acids (3-p-coumaroylquinic acid and 3-feruloylquinic acid), three flavonol glycosides (kaempferol
hexoside, hyperoside, and quercetin acetylglycoside), and five xanthones (tetrahydroxy-one-methoxyxanthone, 1,3,5-trihydroxy-
6-methoxyxanthone, 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxy-2-prenylxanthone, paxanthone, and banaxanthone E). On the other side, HR1 cultures
were better producers of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers) than HR2.This is the first comparative
study on phenolic profile of H. perforatumHR cultures grown under dark and photoperiod conditions.
1. Introduction
Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John’s wort) is a traditional me-
dicinal plant with a complex mixture of secondary met-
abolites. Phenolic compounds as naphthodianthrones, acyl-
phloroglucinols, flavonoids, and xanthones are the main
bioactive metabolites commonly described for this plant [1].
In phytomedicine, Hypericum extracts are responsible for a
plethora of pharmacological activities including antidepres-
sant, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimi-
crobial properties [2]. To meet the increasing demand for
plants utilized in the pharmaceutical industry, much of the
recent research has focussed on the development of new in
vitro culture techniques as a useful alternative to improve the
yield of bioactive metabolites in plant material.
Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated plant transformation
represents a convenient experimental system for establish-
ment of hairy roots (HR). Transformed root cultures repre-
sent an attractive model system for the production of high-
value secondary metabolites, including pharmaceuticals and
other biologically active substances of commercial impor-
tance [3].Namely,HR culturesmay synthesize higher levels of
secondarymetabolites or amounts comparable to those of the
intact plant and offer a promising approach to the industrial
exploitation of HR for production of novel metabolites [4, 5].
Until now, only A. rhizogenes- [6, 7] and biolistic-mediated
[8] transformation methods have been applied. In recent
years, it has been shown that HR are responsive to physical
stimuli such as exposure to light which is known to regulate
a number of plant developmental processes [9], as well as

primary and secondary metabolite production [10]. These
findings indicate that the exposure of HR to light leads to
alternations in their biosynthetic potentials. Although several
studies investigated secondary metabolite production in root
cultures [11, 12], the capacity ofH. perforatumHR to produce
phenolic compounds has never been explored.
This study describes the phenolic profile of transformed
roots (HR) from H. perforatum transformed with A. rhizo-
genes strainA4, grown in constant dark (HR1) or in light/dark
photoperiod (HR2) conditions. Phenolic compounds in HR
were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) coupled with diode array detection (DAD)
and tandem mass spectrometry (MS𝑛) with electrospray
ionization (ESI). All present derivatives of phenolic acids,
flavonol glycosides, flavonoid aglycones, flavan-3-ols, and
xanthones were identified from corresponding UV and MS
spectra and quantified by HPLC-DAD.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Plant Material. Seeds fromH. perforatum were collected
from wild plants growing in a natural population in the
Pelister National Park at about 1394m. Voucher specimen
(number 060231) ofH. perforatum is deposited in theHerbar-
ium at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics,
University “Ss. Cyril and Methodius,” Skopje, Macedonia. As
for a previous study [13], seeds were surface sterilized and
in vitro germinated seedlings were maintained in a growth
chamber at 25 ± 1∘C under a photoperiod of 16 h light, irra-
diance at 50𝜇mol ⋅m2 ⋅ s−1, and 50 to 60% relative humidity.
2.2. Establishment of Hairy Roots. The wild type Agrobac-
terium rhizogenes agropine strain A4 (obtained from Institut
National de la Recherche Agronomique-INRA, Versailles,
France) was used for H. perforatum transformation experi-
ments [14]. Transformation protocol was performed accord-
ing to Di Guardo et al. [6] with the modifications described
in our previous study [15]. Briefly, the HR cultures were
induced by A. rhizogenes A4 from root segments of one-
month-old in vitro germinated seedlings fromH. perforatum.
Transgenic status of the HR was confirmed by PCR analysis
using rolB specific primers [15]. Transformed root cultures
were maintained by subculturing at one-month intervals on
MS/B
5
hormone-free medium. The subculture was carried
out at 25 ± 1∘C in the dark (HR1) and under photoperiod
(HR2) of 16 h light (50 𝜇mol ⋅ m2 ⋅ s−1). One-month-old
HR1 and HR2 cultures were harvested (1 g) and then frozen
in liquid nitrogen or lyophilized and stored at −80∘C, until
analysis.
2.3. HPLC/DAD/ESI-𝑀𝑆𝑛 Analysis. Phenolic compounds
extraction from freeze-dried lyophilized and powdered root
cultures was performed as previously reported by Tusevski et
al. [15]. The HPLC system was equipped with an Agilent 1100
series diode array and mass detector in series (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Waldbronn, Germany). It consisted of a G1312A bi-
nary pump, a G1313A autosampler, a G1322A degasser, and
a G1315B photodiode array detector, controlled by Chem-
Station software (Agilent, v.08.03). Chromatographic sepa-
rations were carried out on 150mm × 4.6mm, 5𝜇m XDB-
C18 Eclipse column (Agilent, USA). The mobile phase con-
sisted of two solvents: water-formic acid (A; 99 : 1, v/v) and
methanol (B) in the following gradient program: 90% A and
10%B (0–20min), 80%A and 20%B (20–30min), 65%A and
35% B (30–50min), 50% A and 50% B (50–70min), and 20%
A and 80% B (70–80min) and continued with 100% B for
a further 10min. Each run was followed by an equilibration
period of 10min. The flow rate was 0.4mL/min and the
injection volume was 10 𝜇L. All separations were performed
at 38∘C. Formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH
3
OH)
were HPLC grade solvents (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The
HPLC-water was purified by a PURELAB Option-Q system
(Elga LabWater, UK).The commercial standards chlorogenic
acid, rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, catechin, epicatechin, and
xanthone (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were used as reference
compounds.The reference compoundswere dissolved in 80%
methanol in water. The concentration of the stock standard
solutions was 1mg ⋅ mL−1 and they were stored at −20∘C.
Spectral data from all peaks were accumulated in the range
of 190–600 nm, and chromatogramswere recorded at 260 nm
for xanthones, at 280 nm for flavan-3-ols, at 330 nm for
phenolic acids, and at 350 nm for flavonols. Peak areas were
used for quantification at wavelengths where each group of
phenolic compounds exhibited an absorptionmaximum.The
HPLC system was connected to the Agilent G2445A ion-trap
mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization
(ESI) system and controlled by LCMSD software (Agilent,
v.6.1.). Nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas at a pressure-
level of 65 psi and the flow was adjusted to 12 L ⋅ min−1.
Both the heated capillary and the voltage were maintained
at 350∘C and 4 kV, respectively. MS data were acquired in
the negative ionization mode. The full scan mass covered
the mass range from m/z 100 to 1200. Collision-induced
fragmentation experiments were performed in the ion trap
using helium as a collision gas, with voltage ramping cycle
from 0.3 up to 2V. Maximum accumulation time of the
ion trap and the number of MS repetitions to obtain the
MS average spectra were set at 300ms and 3, respectively.
Identification of the component peaks was performed by the
UV/Vis, MS, and MS2 spectra and retention times of the
abovementioned available standards.
2.4. Statistical Analysis. Theexperiments were independently
repeated twice under the same conditions and all analyses
were performed in triplicate. Secondary metabolite contents
were expressed as mg ⋅ 100 g−1 dry weight (DW). Standard
deviation of mean value was shown as ± S.D. The statisti-
cal analyses including calculations of means and standard
deviations were performed applying Excel (Microsoft Office,
2007).

explants withA. rhizogenesA4. On the basis of culture condi-
tions, selected dark-grown (HR1) and photoperiod-exposed
(HR2) cultures showed differences in the morphology. Dark-
grown hairy root cultures were thinner and whitish in colour
showing rapid plagiotropic growth with active branching
and vigorous production of elongated lateral roots. Present
results confirmed that transformed roots of H. perforatum
had characteristic traits of HR previously described by Tepfer
[16]. In contrast, HR2 cultures began to turn pale green after
7 days of culture and continued to acquire green coloration
during the course of subsequent growth period. Moreover,
HR2 appeared intense greenish-brown after one month of
culture. It was seen that the growth of HR was generally most
vigorous between the 3rd and 4th weeks of the cultivation
period (1 month), but their growth declined after the 5th
week due to the nutrient depletion. For HPLC analysis, one-
month-old HR cultures were further evaluated.
3.2. HPLC/DAD/ESI-𝑀𝑆𝑛 Analysis. The HPLC/DAD/ESI-
MS𝑛 technique was used to analyse the phenolic profile ofH.
perforatum HR1 and HR2 cultures. Four groups of phenolic
compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonols, flavan-3-ols,
and xanthones were recorded in HR cultures (Tables 1 and
2). The identification of phenolic compounds (Tables 1 and
2, Figure 1) was based on the typical UV/Vis spectral data
and LC/MS in the negative ionizationmode [M–H]− with the
subsequent MS2, MS3, and MS4 analysis for further identifi-
cation with reference to similar data previously reported [15,
17–26]. The HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds revealed
marked differences between HR1 and HR2 cultures (Tables 1
and 2, Figure 1).
3.2.1. Phenolic Acids. Compound F1 occurred at retention
time of 3.9min and exhibited a [M–H]− ion at m/z 191
(Table 1, Figure 1). Its MS2 fragmentation produced a [M–H–
CO–2H
2
O]− ion at m/z 127 as a base peak. A [M–H–H
2
O]−
ion atm/z 173was also observed.CompoundF1was identified
as quinic acid, taking into account its MS𝑛 fragmentation
pattern and the literature data [17]. Quinic acid (F1) was the
only detectable phenolic acid in both HR cultures. A 1.4-fold
increase of quinic acidwas observed inHR2 compared toHR1
cultures.
Two peaks, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid (F3) and 3-
feruloylquinic acid (F5), were detected only in HR2 cultures
with identical UV spectra characterized by absorption band
at 314 nm. Compounds F3 and F5 were readily distinguished
by their cinnamic acid-derivedMS2 base peaks atm/z 163 and
at m/z 193, respectively. Quinic acid is the most important
component as a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of
aromatic compounds.The condensation between quinic acid
and caffeic acid leads to the formation of chlorogenic acid
in the shikimic acid pathway [27]. Chlorogenic acid is an

important antioxidative compound recently produced by H.
perforatum adventitious roots cultivated in bioreactor [11],
shoot cultures [28], and transgenic plantlets [29].
3.2.2. Flavonols. The flavonols were observed to be quali-
tatively and quantitatively different in both H. perforatum
HR cultures (Table 1, Figure 1). A major identified group
of compounds belonged to flavonols according to their
characteristic UV spectra of flavonols glycosylated at C3
(257, 265 sh, 355 nm). The detected compound F8 can be
identified as C-glycoside of quercetin. The deprotonated
molecular ion [M–H]− of compound F8 was detected atm/z
421. It showed MS2 fragmentation characteristic of mono-C-
hexosyl flavones, with losses of 90 and 120 amu [19], giving
m/z 301 ion characteristic for quercetin. The compound F10
had a molecular ion [M–H]− at m/z 477. The MS2 spectra
of this compound showed fragmentation ions at m/z 315
(loss of 162 amu), suggesting a presence of hexose residue.
So, compound F10 was tentatively identified as isorhamnetin
O-hexoside. Compound F13 had a molecular ion [M–H]− at
m/z 609, and its MS2 gave a single ion at m/z 301, indicating
quercetin derivative with rutinose at C3 [20]. The absence
of intermediate fragmentation between the deprotonated
molecular ion and the aglycone ion is indicative of an
interglycosidic linkage 1 → 6 [21]; therefore, this compound
was identified as quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (rutin). Flavonol
glycosides as F8, F10, and F13 detected in HR2 cultures were
in lower amounts compared with those in HR1.
The compound F11 was identified as kaempferol deriva-
tive with glycosylation in position 3 according to its UV-
spectra (256, 266, 350 nm). The MS and MS2 spectra were
consistent with the presence of a hexose residue and confirm
the kaempferol aglycone.Therefore, this compoundwas iden-
tified as kaempferol hexoside. Compound F12 had a deproto-
nated molecular ion [M–H]− at m/z 463 and its MS2 gave a
single ion at m/z 301, indicating quercetin hexose derivative,
most probably hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-galactoside) [30].
Compound F14 gave deprotonated molecular ion atm/z 505.
ItsMS2 fragmentation produced a [M–H–42]− ion atm/z 463
and [M–H–42–162]− ion atm/z 301 as a base peak, indicating
quercetin acetylglycoside. It is worth noting, that flavonol
glycosides as F11, F12, and F14 were synthesized only in HR2
cultures.
With regard to the class of flavonol glycosides, our results
showed that both HR cultures had capability to produce
quercetin and kaempferol derivatives. However, there is no
available study for the potential ofH. perforatum root cultures
to produce flavonol derivatives. Several differences can be
pointed out when comparing the composition of flavonol
glycosides in HR cultures with those of H. perforatum in
vitro cultures. In our previous work [31, 32], we indicated
that H. perforatum cells, calli, and shoots demonstrate a
considerable potential for producing quercetin, isoquercitrin,
and quercitrin upon elicitation with jasmonic acid and sali-
cylic acid. The LC-MS screening of twelve H. perforatumHR
transgenic plants showed a large variability in the content of
rutin, hyperoside, quercetrin, and quercetin [29]. Moreover,
the abovementioned flavonol glycosides had been identified
inH. perforatum regenerated plantlets [33] andH. undulatum
shoot cultures [34].
The HPLC-MS analysis of flavonoid aglycones in HR
cultures resulted in the identification of kaempferol (F15). Its
molecular ion atm/z 285 corresponded to that of kaempferol.
The identification was made by comparing its UV and MS
spectra to analytical standards and literature data [28]. A 1.6-
fold increase of kaempferol was observed in HR2 compared
to HR1 cultures.
3.2.3. Flavan-3-ols. Flavan-3-ols (catechins) were identified
as the main flavonoid fraction in HR cultures. The HPLC
analysis confirmed the presence of 5 flavan-3-ols: F2, F4,
F6, F7, and F9 in both HR cultures (Table 1, Figure 1). The
mass spectrum in full scan mode showed the deprotonated
molecules [M–H]− of catechin (F2) and epicatechin (F6) at
m/z 289, with characteristic MS2 ions at m/z 245 and 205
and UV maximum at 280 nm. Compounds F4, F7, and F9
had [M–H]− at m/z 577 and main fragmentation with loss
of 152 amu, characteristic fragmentation pathway by retro
Diels-Alder reaction [22], and were recognized as proantho-
cyanidin dimers. Dark-grown HR were better producers of
catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers thanHR2. Literature
data about the production of catechin derivatives in in vitro
cultures of H. perforatum are scarce. In our previous work
[35], we indicated that H. perforatum root cultures may
be considered as a promising source of proanthocyanidin
dimers. Nevertheless, catechin, epicatechin, and proantho-
cyanidin dimers had been previously identified in shoots and
calli ofH. erectum [36] andH. undulatum shoot cultures [34].
3.2.4. Xanthones. Xanthones comprise the majority of
the phenolic compounds detected by HPLC/DAD/ESI-
MS𝑛 (Table 2, Figure 1). They include simple oxygenated
xanthones or derivatives with prenyl, pyran, or methoxy
groups. Compound X1 was putatively identified as

mangiferin. The HPLC-MS/MS analysis of this compound
gave a molecular ion m/z [M–H]− of 421 and major −MS2
fragments atm/z 331 [M–H–90]− and 301 [M–H–120]−, losses
characteristics of C-hexosyl compounds [19]. Compounds
X4,X6,X8,X13, andX20 showedUV spectral characteristics
of the 1,3,5,6 oxygenated xanthones, with band IV reduced to
shoulder [37], while most of the other identified xanthones
had UV spectra similar to mangiferin typical of the 1,3,6,7
oxygenation pattern with a very well-defined band IV
[23, 38]. Compounds X6 and X7 were identified as 1,3,5,6-
tetrahydroxyxanthone and 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone
aglycones, respectively (single intensemolecular ion [M–H]−
atm/z 259) [20, 25]. Compounds X4 and X5 gave molecular
ions [M–H]− at m/z 517. Major −MS2 fragments at m/z 365
and 257, respectively, characterized them as dimers of 1,3,5,6-
tetrahydroxyxanthone and 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone.
Compound X10 gave a molecular ion [M–H]− at m/z 273
and major MS2 fragment at m/z 258 [M–H–15]−. The
MS analysis indicates the presence of one methoxy and
three hydroxyl groups. These together with comparison to
literature data gave its identification as 1,3,5-trihydroxy-
6-methoxyxanthone [26]. Compound X8 had the same
UV spectra as compound X11 but contained one hydroxy
group more and molecular ion [M–H]− at 289, base peak
at m/z 274. We tentatively assigned this compound as
tetrahydroxy-one-methoxyxanthone (X8). Compound X11
was putatively identified as mangiferin-C-prenyl isomer. The
HPLC-MS/MS analysis of this compound gave molecular
ions [M–H]− at m/z 489 and major MS2 fragments at m/z
399 [M–H–90]−, 369 [M–H–120]− with losses characteristics
of C-hexosyl compounds [21] and 327 as a base peak (1,3,6,7-
tetrahydroxyxanthone-C-prenyl residue). Compounds X12
and X17 had UV spectra characteristic of 1,3,6,7-oxygenated
xanthones and molecular ions [M–H]− at 327. So, these
compounds were identified as 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone-
C-prenyl isomers. In the literature, it is found that in
some Hypericum species, the C-prenyl moiety can be in
position 2 or 8 [24]. They can be tentatively assigned as
1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone (X12) and 1,3,6,7-
tetrahydroxy-2-prenyl xanthone (X17). Compounds X13
and X20 had same fragmentation pattern as X12 and
X17 but different UV spectra, characteristic of 1,3,5,6-
tetrahydroxyxanthone, leading to their assignment as 1,3,
5,6-tetrahydroxy-C-prenylxanthone. These compounds were
identified as 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxy-8-prenylxanthone (X13)
and 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxy-2-prenylxanthone (X20). Com-
pound X14 gave molecular ion [M–H]− at m/z 327 but
showed a different fragmentation pattern in comparison
with the other compounds with the same mass. In the MS2,
a loss of a hydroxyl group [M–H
2
O]− to give the base peak
The Scientific World Journal 7
at m/z 309 is exhibited, indicating that the OH group is not
linked to the xanthone aglycone but to the prenyl group.
In the next MS3 step, after the loss of the prenyl moiety,
the base peak at m/z 257 was detected. According to this
behavior and literature data [26], it is evident that this
compound is 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-bu-
tenyl)-xanthone. Xanthones X16 and X19 were identified
as 1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-8-prenyl xanthone and 1,3,
6-trihydroxy-7-methoxy-8-prenyl xanthone (molecular ions
[M–H]− atm/z 341), respectively, using the obtained spectral
data and comparison to previously published data [20, 24, 25].
Compound X23 had similar fragmentation pattern as com-
poundX16, indicating that compoundX23 has similar nature
as compound X16. We can tentatively term compound X23
as trihydroxy-1-metoxy-C-prenyl xanthone. The comparison
to previously published data [39] for UV and MS spectra
indicates that compound X25 is 𝛾-mangostin (molecular
ion [M–H]− at m/z 395). Compounds X18 and X22 were
putatively identified as isomers of 𝛾-mangostin (1,3,6,7-
tetrahydroxyxanthone-C-bis-prenyl), since they have a
similar molecular ion [M–H]− of 395 but different UV
spectra and retention times. Compound X15 gave a [M–H]−
peak at m/z 325. The UV spectrum was characteristic of
1,3,5,6-tetraoxygenated xanthone. A distinct shoulder at
365 nm revealed conjugation with a pyran ring. The MS𝑛
and UV spectra were in complete agreement with those of
toxyloxanthone [25]. CompoundX21 gave a [M–H]− peak at
m/z 339, which results from methylation of toxyloxanthone
giving paxanthone [23, 25, 40]. Compounds X26, X28, X30,
and X32 gave deprotonated molecular ions [M–H]− at m/z
461, 463, 477, and 413, respectively. Their MS2 spectra were
generated by the loss of a prenyl residue C
4
H
8
(56 amu) and
two prenyl residues (112 amu). So, compounds X26, X28,
X30, and X32 were identified as banaxanthone D, garcinone
E, banaxanthone E, and garcinone C, respectively. Several
other peaks (X2,X3,X9,X24,X27,X29,X31, andX33) were
categorized as xanthone derivatives by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS
analysis but were not fully identified.
Among the twenty-five identified xanthones, seven (X6,
X7, X12, X14, X15, X18, and X28) were upregulated in
HR2 compared to HR1 cultures. Moreover, five xanthones
(X8, X10, X20, X21, and X30) were synthesized only in
HR2 cultures. Recent studies showed that Hypericum in
vitro cultures have the potential to accumulate xanthones
and their production can be manipulated by the hormonal
supplementation [28], or/and by the culture type [33]. It is
probable that phytohormones either facilitate or hamper the
expression and activity of specific xanthone enzymes that
influence xanthone accumulation in H. perforatum callus
[33], cells [28], and root cultures [12]. Namely, Tocci et
al. [12] suggested that root cultures grow continuously on
nutrient media supplemented with auxins, but sometimes
repetitive subcultures may induce loss of morphogenetic
potential, resulting in poor or negligible secondary metabo-
lite production. On the other hand, our results showed that
H. perforatum HR cultures successfully grow on hormone-
free media and represent a continuous source for high-level
xanthone production.
Taken together, results in our study showed distinct phe-
nolic profile between dark-grown (HR1) and photoperiod-
exposed (HR2) cultures. Namely, phenolic compounds iden-
tified in HR2 cultures compared to HR1 could be dis-
tinguished in four groups: (i) compounds whose quantity
increased (F1, F15, X6, X7, X12, X14, X15, X18, and X28),
(ii) compounds whose quantity decreased (F2, F4, F6–F10,
F13, X1, X4, X5, X17, X23, and X32), (iii) compounds that
were not detectable (X11,X13,X16,X19,X22,X25, andX26),
and (iv) compounds that were de novo synthesized (F3, F5,
F11, F12, F14, X8, X10, X20, X21, and X30). Consequently,
results from our experiments demonstrated that the exposure
of HR2 cultures to photoperiod leads to alternations in their
biosynthetic potentials.
Recent study showed that the phenolic biosynthesis and
flavonoids formation are light-dependent processes [41].
Moreover, changes in light intensity are capable of inducing
the production of flavonoids and total phenolics in plants
[42]. Therefore, de novo biosynthesis and accumulation of
phenolic acids, flavonols, and xanthones in HR2 cultures are
not surprising since considerable evidence now shows that
many of the enzymes in the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid path-
way could be upregulated by light. In addition, Abbasi et al.
[43] demonstrated light-stimulated accumulation of phenolic
acids and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity in
Echinacea purpurea HR cultures. Considering results from
our study, we could hypothesize that shifting the dark-grown
HR to photoperiod might induce a short-term “light-stress”
response. In this view, the presence of light could induce
a variety of responses along with metabolic changes that
directly or indirectly trigger a “later” increase in xanthone
accumulation. On the other hand, our results showed that
photoperiod has an inhibitory effect on the accumulation
of flavan-3-ols in HR2 cultures. Possible reasons for down-
regulation of flavan-3-ols could be due to the activation of
their catabolism and/or reaction to unidentified products that
exist in photoperiod-exposed cultures.Therefore, photoregu-
lation of phenolic compounds biosynthesis in H. perforatum
HR may offer additional advantages of quantitative and
qualitative improvements of these medicinally important
metabolites.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion,H. perforatumHR cultures provided a promis-
ing system for the production of various groups of phenolic
compounds. Distinct phenolic profile between dark-grown
and photoperiod-exposedHR cultures was shown as detailed
for the first time. HR cultures grown under photoperiod can
be proposed as a useful source for accumulation of phenolic
acids and flavonols, while dark-adapted HR represent an
alternative tool for flavan-3-ol production.More importantly,
both HR cultures synthesized and stored significant quanti-
ties of xanthones. The use of the results reported here might
contribute to further study on photoregulation and optimal
control of secondary metabolite production inH. perforatum
HR cultures.
