Carpinella).1 Members of the National Research Council of Argea b s t r a c tScreening of 91 native plants from central Argentina was carried out with the aim of finding new sourcesof anti-tyrosinase compounds. Extracts obtained from Achyrocline satureioides, Artemisia verlotiorum,Cotoneaster glaucophylla, Dalea elegans, Flourensia campestris, Jodina rhombifolia, Kageneckia lanceolata,Lepechinia floribunda, Lepechinia meyenii, Lithrea molleoides, Porlieria microphylla, Pterocaulon alopecuroides,Ruprechtia apetala, Senna aphylla, Sida rhombifolia, Solanum argentinum, Tagetes minuta and Thalictrumdecipiens exhibited more than 90% inhibition of tyrosinase monophenolase activity at 1000 lg ml1.D. elegans, L. meyenii and L. molleoides were the most potent with IC50 values of 0.48, 10.43 and 3.77lg ml1, respectively. D. elegans, L. molleoides and T. decipiens also showed more than 90% inhibitionof diphenolase activity at 1000 lg ml1, with the first of these being the most effective(IC50 = 49.27 lg ml1). (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1) was isolated from L. molleoides as aneffective tyrosinase inhibitor with L-tyrosine or L-DOPA as substrates (IC50 = 0.49 and 14.94 lg ml1,respectively). Compound 1 was 37 times more active in monophenolase inhibitory activity than kojic acidused as a reference. Effective extracts as well as (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol could prove to bepromising preservative agents for use in the food industry. 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionTyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), a copper containing enzyme, alsoknown as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), is involved in the initial stepof melanin synthesis (Karioti, Protopappa, Megoulas, & Skaltsa,2007). This protein, which catalyses the hydroxylation of L-tyrosineto 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (monophenolase activity)and the consequent oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone (dipheno-lase activity), is widespread in many organisms such as verte-brates, invertebrates, plants and microorganisms (Chen & Kubo,2002).As mentioned, tyrosinase catalyses the oxidation of phenoliccompounds into highly reactive quinones, which can polymeriseleading to the darkening of plant or shellfish products during pro-cessing or storage (Gawlik-Dziki, Złotek, & Świeca, 2008). Althoughenzymatic browning is beneficial for certain foods (He, Luo, &Chen, 2008), it produces a less attractive appearance and loss innutritional quality of a variety of fruits, vegetables and crustaceans(Qiu et al., 2009). Hence, agents for inhibiting this phenomenon arell rights reserved.11; fax: +54 0351 4938061..edu.ar, cecicarpi@yahoo.comntina (CONICET).needed in order to maintain the appearance, flavour, texture andnutritional value of many fresh-cut products.Despite the large number of PPO inhibitors, only a few of theseare used today, as many of them show side effects or low effective-ness (Yi, Wu, Cao, Song, & Ma, 2009). In the past, sulphites werewidely used as tyrosinase inhibitors for their antibrowning effect.However, their use has been regulated in order to ensure consumersafety since these preservatives affect the nutritional quality offoods and can cause allergic reactions as well as gastrointestinaldistress (Ruiz-Capillas & Jiménez-Colmenero, 2009). Another cur-rently used preservative, ascorbic acid, could negatively affectthe aroma of some beverages and its activity is temporary(Komthong, Igura, & Shimoda, 2007). The identification of newtyrosinase inhibitors for preservative use in food industry is thusof great concern to researchers.It is well known that plants are an important source of com-pounds with different activities such as insecticidal, herbicidal,antimicrobial, medicinal, antioxidant (Carpinella, Ferrayoli, &Palacios, 2005; Carpinella, Ferrayoli, Valladares, Defago, & Palacios,2002; Carpinella & Rai, 2009; Carpinella et al., 2007; Rai & Carpi-nella, 2006) and enzyme inhibition including tyrosinase (Kim &Uyama, 2005). Many anti-tyrosinase compounds derived fromplants are considered free of harmful side effects and can beobtained at low cost (Zheng, Cheng, Chao, Wu, & Wang, 2008).These observations and the need for new agents with tyrosinaseM.E. Chiari et al. / Food Chemistry 120 (2010) 10–14 11inhibitory activity, led us to search for such chemicals among 91extracts prepared from native plants of central Argentina that aregenerally used for beverages and/or for medicinal infusions.The extracts were screened with the aim of selecting those withmost activity. Subsequently, from the one obtained from Lithreamolleoides a compound was detected with a high anti-tyrosinaseeffect.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsPlants were collected in the hills of Córdoba Province, Argen-tina, from November 2005 to December 2007. Voucher specimenshave been deposited in the ‘‘Marcelino Sayago” Herbarium of theSchool of Agricultural Science, Catholic University of Córdoba andwere authenticated by the botanist, Gustavo Ruiz.Plants were selected according to their availability, accessibilityand especially the lack of scientific information about their activityand/or chemical pattern.Crushed aerial plant material was extracted by 48 h macerationwith ethanol. The yields of the most active extracts, obtained aftersolvent removal and expressed as percentage weight of air-driedcrushed plant material, are shown in Table 1.OHOH241´4´7´13´Fig. 1. Chemical structure of (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1).2.2. Chemicals, equipment and reagentsL-Tyrosine, 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and lyoph-ilised mushroom tyrosinase were purchased from Sigma–AldrichCO (St. Louis, MO). Kojic acid was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt,Germany). Silica gel (70–230 mesh) used for column chromatogra-phy was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich CO and all solvents wereHPLC grade. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in Chloro-form-d3 with Bruker AVANCE II 400 spectrometer (Bruker Corpora-tion, Ettlingen, Germany) operated at 400 MHz for 1H and at100 MHz for the 13C nucleus. Chemical shifts (parts per million)are relative to internal tetramethylsilane used as a reference(d = 0.00). MS spectra were measured with a ZAB SEQ (BeqQ)instrument (VG Analytical, Manchester). For quantifying the purecompound, HPLC was performed on a Phenomenex Prodigy 5 lODS (4.6 mm i.d.  250 mm) reversed-phase column eluting with90% acetonitrile in water with 1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA) as mobilephase and UV detection at 280 nm.Table 1Native plants from central Argentina showing high tyrosinase inhibitory activity.Plant species FamilyAchyrocline satureioides (Lam.)

Isolation of the tyrosinase inhibitor compoundThe resulting viscous extract from L. molleoides was dissolved inethanol and subjected to a column chromatography with hexane/diethyl ether (Et2O)/methanol (MeOH) gradient to yield ten frac-tions (F1–F10). F7–F10 were further purified by successive columnchromatographies with the same solvent mixture at increasingpolarity. Finally, five fractions were obtained (F1–F5) and F2 elutedwith hexane/Et2O (60:40, v/v) was subjected to another columnchromatography and then radial preparative chromatography (sol-vent gradient methylene chloride (CH2Cl2)/Et2O) affording with100% CH2Cl2 a yellowish oil (yield 0.78 g/100 g of crushed plantmaterial, by HPLC).This compound was identified as the alkylresorcinol (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1) (Fig. 1) (Valcic, Wätcher, Eppler,& Timmermann, 2002).(Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1): C19H28O2. tR 4.46 min(by HPLC).

Then, 20 ll of tested solution dissolved in DMSOat the concentrations needed or DMSO (control), were added. Allsamples were first tested at 1000 lg ml1 and those showing 90%inhibition or higher in three different repetitions were further eval-uated for the concentration necessary for 50% inhibition (IC50). Theassay mixture was then incubated at 37 C for 90 min with gentleagitation. At this stage a stable absorbance was reached. Finally,40 ll of 2.5 mM L-tyrosine or L-DOPA in phosphate buffer wereadded and immediately monitored (t = 0) at 450 nm for dopa-chrome formation in the reaction mixture. Measurements were re-peated up to 15 min for monophenolase activity and up to 5 minfor diphenolase activity. Differences in absorbance between eachtime measured and time zero were calculated and the inhibitionpercentage was determined respect to control.Kojic acid, dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer was used as apositive control. Each measurement was made at least in duplicate.2.5. Statistical analysisThe results are expressed as mean ± standard error (SD). Theinhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated by log-Probitanalysis.3. ResultsBecause of the urgent need for new agents with inhibitory activ-ity on tyrosinase, we performed a screening of extracts obtainedfrom native plants from central Argentina with the aim of findingthese.The results of the screening showed that 18 of the 91 extractstested showed high monophenolase inhibitory activity on tyrosi-nase with percentages above 90% at 1000 lg ml1 (see Table 2).Dalea elegans was the most potent plant showing an IC50 of0.48 lg ml1 followed by L. molleoides (IC50 = 3.77 lg ml1) andLepechinia meyenii (IC50 = 10.43 lg ml1) (Table 2).D. elegans, L. molleoides and Thalictrum decipiens showed morethan 90% inhibition of diphenolase activity at 1000 lg ml1, withthe first of these being the most effective (IC50 = 49.27 lg ml1) fol-Table 2Most effective extracts of native plants from central Argentina on mushroomtyrosinase.

Because of these results and dueto its high availability and accessibility in the hill area of Córdoba,L. molleoides was selected as a first potential source of new anti-tyrosinase compounds.From the ethanolic extract of this plant, a compound containinga C-13 unsaturated hydrocarbon side chain attached at positionfive to a dihydroxyphenyl moiety was obtained. It was identifiedas (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1) (Fig. 1).Compound 1 inhibited the monophenolase activity of tyrosi-nase showing an IC50 value of 0.49 lg ml1 (Table 2), while 50%inhibition of the diphenolase activity was reached at 14.94 lg ml1(Table 3). It inhibited tyrosinase activity when using L-tyrosine orL-DOPA as substrates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a andb). It exhibited significant inhibitory effect on monophenolaseactivity, with 32% inhibition at 0.24 lg ml1, 93% at 3.91 lg ml1and total inhibition at 7.81 lg ml1. At the latter concentration,kojic acid showed a weak inhibition (22%) and just reached 96%inhibition at 125 lg ml1. Compound 1 inhibited 21% of dipheno-lase enzyme activity at 3.91 lg ml1, 81% at 62.50 lg ml1 and98% at 1000 lg ml1. In regard to this activity, kojic acid was moreeffective than the alkyl resorcinol, reaching 98% inhibition at250 lg ml1.Monophenolase activity is typically characterised by a lag time,which is the time required to reach the steady-state concentrationof o-diphenols which reduce the met form of tyrosinase to thedeoxy form which then converts to the oxy form. The kinetic courseof the oxidation of L-tyrosine observed with the formation of dopa-chrome in the presence of different concentrations of compound 1is shown in Fig. 3. At concentrations of 1.95 and 3.91 lg ml1, thelag period was extended till 10 min. Furthermore, compound 1 re-duced the reaction rate in a dose-dependent manner.4. DiscussionMuch effort has been spent in the search for new effective, sta-ble, low-toxic anti-tyrosinase compounds.According to IC50 values, using L-tyrosine as substrate, we weresurprised to find that ethanolic extract from D. elegans(IC50 = 0.48 lg ml1) was 38 times more effective than that of kojicacid, the IC50 of which was 18.25 lg ml1. L. meyenii and L. molleo-ides extracts (IC50 = 10.43 and 3.77 lg ml1, respectively) were alsohighly active showing almost two and five times, respectively,more potency than that of the reference. Cotoneaster glaucophylla,Pterocaulon alopecuroides, Solanum argentinum and T. decipiens(IC50 = 14.28–21.90 lg ml1), in turn, exhibited similar levels ofeffectiveness to that of kojic acid.Among plants with inhibition of the oxidation of L-DOPA cata-lysed by tyrosinase, D. elegans, L. molleoides and T. decipiensFig. 3. Course of the oxidation of L-tyrosine by tyrosinase in the presence ofdifferent concentrations of (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1). Concentra-tions of 1 for curves 1–6 were 0, 0.24, 0.49, 0.98, 1.95 and 3.91 lg ml1,respectively. Compound 1 was incubated with tyrosinase at 37 C with L-tyrosineas substrate. Dopachrome formation was determined at different times till 15 min.Fig. 2. (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-dienyl)-resorcinol (1) inhibits tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 1 or kojic acid were incubated with tyrosinase at 37 Cwith (a) L-tyrosine or (b) L-DOPA as substrates. Data represent the mean ± SD for duplicate within one experiment as a percentage of the control mean measured at 10 and2 min from beginning of experiment for mono- and diphenolase activity, respectively.M.E. Chiari et al. / Food Chemistry 120 (2010) 10–14 13(IC50 = 49.27–158.03 lg ml1) showed themselves less effectivethan that of the positive control (IC50 = 2.64 lg ml1).A literature survey appears to show no information of anti-tyrosinase properties in any of the 18 plant species with highinhibitory effectiveness.A compound belonging to the alkylresorcinol family was iso-lated from L. molleoides and identified as (Z,Z)-5-(trideca-4,7-die-nyl)-resorcinol 1. Surprisingly, compound 1 (IC50 = 0.49 lg ml1)was 37 times more active than kojic acid when L-tyrosine was usedas substrate. Its activity was 81 times stronger than the well-known tyrosinase inhibitor arbutin, the IC50 of which correspondedto 39.71 lg ml1 (Zheng et al., 2008) and 44 times more active thanthe extensively used sodium bisulphite (IC50 = 21.84 lg ml1)(Friedman & Bautista, 1995).The well-known trans-stilbene resveratrol, showed an IC50 of12.46 lg ml1 (Kim, Yun, Lee, Lee, & Min, 2002) which is higherthan that observed for compound 1. Oxyresveratrol isolated fromMorus alba and considered one of the most potent tyrosinase inhib-itors in nature (Kim, Son, Chang, Kang, & Kim, 2003), showed anIC50 of 0.29 lg ml1 (Kim et al., 2002), very close to that obtainedfor the isolated alkylresorcinol when inhibiting the hydroxylationof L-tyrosine.When L-DOPA was used as substrate, compound 1 showed sig-nificant inhibition of diphenolase activity (IC50 of 14.94 lg ml1)but weaker in comparison to that of kojic acid. On the contrary,the alkylresorcinol was 1.6 times more active than ascorbic acid(IC50 = 24.6 lg ml1) (Yi et al., 2009).Compounds with 4-substituted resorcinol skeleton have beenreported as potent inhibitors of tyrosinase (Shimizu, Kondo, & Sa-kai, 2000). Among these, 4-hexylresorcinol has been recognised asa safe and effective tyrosinase inhibitor for use in the food industry(Zheng et al., 2008) and its use as a preservative is permitted inmany countries (Martínez-Alvarez, López-Caballero, Montero, &Gómez-Guillén, 2007). According to Kim and Uyama (2005), theeffectiveness of these molecules is due to substitution in 4-posi-tion, mainly with hydrophobic substituents, since resorcinol with-out substitution is a poor inhibitor of the phenoloxidase (Kim &Uyama, 2005). The same seems to happen with resorcinols substi-tuted in 5-position, as is demonstrated by compound 1 activity andfor other 5-alkyl resorcinols (Miura et al., 1995). The long hydro-phobic alkyl chain may associate with the hydrophobic bindingpocket close to the binuclear copper active site, as happened withother hydrophobic inhibitors (Conrad, Dawso, Hubbard, Meyers, &Strothkamp, 1994).Despite L. molleoides shows medicinal properties (Araujo, Bela,Bueno, Rodrigues, & Shimizu, 2006; Fernández et al., 2002; Kottet al., 1999; Muschietti et al., 2005), its effect in inhibiting tyrosi-nase has not yet been explored. It has been reported that com-pound 1 produces paralysis on nematodes (Valcic et al., 2002)and exerts a cytotoxic effect on human tumoral cell lines (Lópezet al., 2005), but its tyrosinase activity inhibition has not yet beendescribed. This means that this is the first time that a compoundshowing this property has been isolated from L. molleoides.Although toxic effects of compound 1 have not yet been deter-mined, other alkyl resorcinols can be found in many edible plants,fruits and grains (Seitz, 1992), thus denoting its low toxicity. Be-sides, L. molleoides is used in traditional medicine as an infusion(López et al., 2005), and thus few or no side effects are expected.In this sense, it is expected that compound 1 could present few sideeffects, thus ensuring its safe use as an anti-tyrosinase compound.From the more than satisfactory results obtained from this workand taking into account their potential applications in food indus-try, the tyrosinase inhibitors found could arise as promising agentsfor preserving many food products.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Catholic University of Córdoba,FONCyT PICT 2005 and PICTO CRUP 2005.
