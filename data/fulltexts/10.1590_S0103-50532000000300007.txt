Um novo ácido triterpenóide pentacíclico foi isolado a partir de folhas e frutos de Vochysia
ferruginea. A estrutura do novo composto foi elucidada por espectroscopia de RMN como sendo o
ácido 2α,3β,6β-triidroxiolean-12-en-28-óico (ácido 6β-hidroximaslínico, 1). Além do novo
triterpenóide, foram isolados das folhas e frutos o glicosídeo de β-sitosterol e três misturas contendo
os triterpenóides conhecidos uvaol e eritrodiol, ácidos ursólico e oleanólico e os ácidos 2α,3β-
diidroxiurs-12-en-28-óico e o respectivo isômero oleanólico (ácido maslínico ou cratególico). Nos
frutos, a bellericagenina A e o seu éster (28 → 1) β-D-glicopiranosílico (bellericasídeo A) estão
presentes em elevados teores.
A novel oleane acid was isolated from the leaves and the fruits of Vochysia ferruginea. The
structure of the new triterpenoid was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy as 2α,3β,6β-trihydroxy-
olean-12-en-28-oic acid (6β-hydroxymaslinic acid, 1). In addition, β-sitosterol-glucoside and three
mixtures containing known triterpenoids, uvaol and erythrodiol, ursolic and oleanolic acids,  2α,3β-
dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid and its respective oleanolic isomer (maslinic or crategolic acid),
were isolated from the leaves and the fruits of Vochysia ferruginea. In the fruits, bellericagenin A and
its (28 → 1)β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (bellericaside A) were present in high amount.

Introduction
The genus Vochysia (Vochysiaceae) seems to be an
abundant source of triterpenoids. Bartogenic and
vismiaefolic acids have been reported from V. vismiaefolia1;
betulinic, 4-epi-vismiaefolic, and 2α,3β,19α-trihydroxy-
24-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acids from V. piramidalis2.
From the stem bark of V. divergens we isolated the ter-
penoids β-sitosterol, betulinic, sericic, divergioic and 24-
hydroxytormentic acids, and the (28 → 1) β-D-glucopyra-
nosyl ester of later3-5. Sericic acid (2α,3β,19,24-tetrahy-
droxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid) presented antifungal3 and
antibacterial4 activities. 24-Hydroxytormentic acid showed
antinociceptive action6.
V. ferruginea is a tree commonly found in wet soils of
Venezuelan Amazon7. In this communication we report the
structure elucidation of 6β-hydroxymaslinic acid, 1, a novel
triterpenoid of the oleane series obtained from the leaves
and the fruits of V. ferruginea. β-sitosterol-glucoside and
mixtures of uvaol and erythrodiol, ursolic and oleanolic
acids, 2α,3β-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid and its respec-
tive oleanolic isomer (maslinic or crategolic acid) were also
obtained. Bellericagenin A and its (28 → 1) β-D-glucopy-
ranosyl ester (bellericaside A) were present in high amount
in the fruits.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were determined using a Kofler hot-stage
instrument and were uncorrected. IR spectra were measured
on a Perkin-Elmer 1320 spectrometer. 1H and 13C-NMR
spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or in pyridine-d5, using
TMS as internal reference, employing a Varian Gemini 300
(1H, 300 MHz; 13C, 75 MHz) spectrometer. Optical rotations
were measured in a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter.
242 Zucaro et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc
Mass spectra were recorded on a HP 5988A apparatus (EI,
70 eV). Isolation procedures were monitored by employ-
ing thin-layer chromatography on pre-coated silica gel
plates (Merck, Kieselgel 60 F-254).
Plant material
Vochysia ferruginea Mart (Vochysiaceae) was collected
in the margins of Cataniapo River near Puerto Ayacucho
(Amazona State, Venezuela) and identified by Dr. A.
Castillo. A voucher specimen is deposited in the Herbarium
of the Escuela de Biologia, Universidad Central de Ven-
ezuela, Caracas, under number AC 3301.
Extraction and isolation
Air dried and powdered leaves (400 g) were exhaus-
tively extracted at room temperature with CHCl3 to give
after evaporation a residue (8.0 g), which was purified by
CC (SiO2 ; CHCl3 with increasing amounts of MeOH).
The first three fractions (eluted with CHCl3 - MeOH, 49:1,
19:1, and 9:1, respectively) gave unseparated mixtures of
uvaol and erythrodiol (38 mg), of ursolic and oleanolic
acids (280 mg), and of 2α,3β-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic
and 2α,3β-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acids (maslinic
or crategolic acid, 220 mg). After repeated chromathogra-
phy, the fourth fraction also eluted with CHCl3-MeOH,
9:1, yielded β-sitosterol-glucoside (200 mg) and 6β-
hydroxymaslinic acid, 1 (92 mg).
 The crushed fruits (196 g) were exhaustively extracted
with hot CHCl3-EtOH,1:1 in Soxlet apparatus. The resi-
due (5.7 g) was suspended in cold MeOH and filtered. By
crystallization (MeOH) the solid material gave bellericage-
nin A (2.8 g). The MeOH soluble portions (1.6 g) were
purified by CC (SiO2 ; EtOAc with increasing amounts of
MeOH). Oleanolic acid (20 mg) and 1 (40 mg) were eluted
with EtOAc, further bellericagenin A (1.1 g; total yield,
2% of the fruits) with EtOAc-MeOH, 97:3. The last eluted
fraction (EtOAc-MeOH,19:1) yielded bellericaside A after
washing with cold acetone (50mg). Methylation of 1 with
ethereal diazomethane afforded the monomethyl ester 1a.

Other known compounds
Uvaol and erythrodiol, ursolic and oleanolic acids, and
2α,3β-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid and 2α,3β-dihy-
droxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid (maslinic acid or crategolic
acid) were identified by the comparison of 13C NMR data
with those reported in the literature8. Oleanolic acid and
β-sitosterol glucoside by comparison with authentic
samples available in our laboratory.
Results and Discussion
Upon repeated column chromatography the CHCl3
extract of the leaves afforded b-sitosterol glucoside and
isomeric mixtures of uvaol/erythrodiol, ursolic/oleanolic
acids, and 2α,3β-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic/maslinic
acids, as well as a single compound characterized as 6β-
hydroxymaslinic acid, 1, which was obtained as a dextroro-
tatory powder. The molecular ion m/z 502 of monomethyl
ester 1a and NMR data of 1 are consistent with the mo-
lecular formula C30H48O5. The complete 1H and 13C as-
signments for 6β-hydroxymaslinic acid, 1, are reported in
Experimental and in Table 1 as a result of APT and HETCOR
experiments and some INEPT measurements. Preliminary
inspection of the data disclosed the presence of seven ter-
tiary methyls, three oxymethine groups (δC 83.9, 68.2 and
67.4) and a trisubstituted double bond (δC 144.0 and 122.7;
δH 5.57, br t). These findings clearly suggested a trihydroxy-
olean-12-en-28-oic gross structure for 6β-hydroxymaslinic
acid (1) rather than that of an urs-12-en derivative9. The 1H
NMR spectrum disclosed the presence of a doublet (J 9.5
Hz) at δ 3.42 (H-3α) suggesting that two of hydroxy groups
are in the 2α,3β positions10. This assumption was confirmed
by the comparison of 13C NMR parameters for ring A car-
bons with those of 2α,3β-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic
acid11 (maslinic acid; Table 1). Analogously, the third
hydroxyl was assigned 6β comparing the 13C NMR data
for B-E ring carbons with those of 2α,3β,6β,23-tetrahy-
droxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid12 (terminolic acid; Table 1)
and 2α,3β,6β,19a-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid13
(compound A, Table 1). Signals of carbons 24, 25 and 26
in 13C NMR spectrum of 1 are deshielded in respect to
maslinic acid (Table 1), which can be justified by δ effect
of the hydroxyl group on 6β. Therefore, 6β-hydroxy-
maslinic acid, 1, was characterized as 2α,3β,6β-trihydroxy-
olean-12-en-28-oic acid.

*Selective INEPTL experiments
Most of the assignments of Experimental and Table 1
have been confirmed by selective INEPT experiments
(Table 2); in particular, the selective irradiation of the broad
singlet at δ 4.85 (H-6α) gave a response on the signals at
39.2 and 38.3 ppm, C-4 and C-10, respectively.
Finally, the relative configuration of the molecule was
checked by Difference NOE spectra. Mutual enhancement
of the signals were observed among H-3, Me-23, H-5 and
H-6α, as well as among H-2β, Me-24 and Me-25.
Methylation of 1 with ethereal diazomethane afforded
the monomethyl ester 1a. MS spectrum of 1a presented the
expected Retro Diels-Alder fragmentation pattern14 (Figure
1). The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (see Experimental)
were also in accordance with the structure proposed for 1a.
Examination of the fruits of Vochysia ferruginea led
to the isolation in high yield of bellicagenin A (see Ex-
perimental) and its (28 → 1) β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (bel-
lericaside A) previously found in Terminalia bellerica
(Combretaceae)15. On the basis of HETCOR, APT and
