We investigated the role of gibberellins (GAs) in the effect of
pat-2, a recessive mutation that induces facultative parthenocarpic
fruit development in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) using
near-isogenic lines with two different genetic backgrounds. Unpol-
linated wild-type Madrigal (MA/wt) and Cuarenteno (CU/wt) ova-
ries degenerated, but GA3 application induced parthenocarpic fruit
growth. On the contrary, parthenocarpic growth of MA/pat-2 and
CU/pat-2 fruits, which occurs in the absence of pollination and
hormone application, was not affected by GA3. Pollinated MA/wt
and parthenocarpic MA/pat-2 ovary development was negated by
paclobutrazol, and this inhibitory effect was counteracted by GA3.
The main GAs of the early-13-hydroxylation pathway (GA1, GA3,
GA8, GA19, GA20, GA29, GA44, GA53, and, tentatively, GA81) and
two GAs of the non-13-hydroxylation pathway (GA9 and GA34)
were identified in MA/wt ovaries by gas chromatography-selected
ion monitoring. GAs were quantified in unpollinated ovaries at
flower bud, pre-anthesis, and anthesis. In unpollinated MA/pat-2
and CU/pat-2 ovaries, the GA20 content was much higher (up to
160 times higher) and the GA19 content was lower than in the
corresponding non-parthenocarpic ovaries. The application of an
inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases suggested that
GA20 is not active per se. The pat-2 mutation may increase GA
20-oxidase activity in unpollinated ovaries, leading to a higher
synthesis of GA20, the precursor of an active GA.
Fruit development can be divided usually into three
phases (Gillaspy et al., 1993). The earliest phase (up to
around anthesis) involves the development of the ovary
and the decision to abort or to continue with growth. It is
currently accepted that the coordinated action of growth
signals triggers fruit-set and growth, so in the absence of
pollination and fertilization, the ovary will cease cell divi-
sion and abscise (Gillaspy et al., 1993; Garcı´a-Martı´nez and
Hedden, 1997). Parthenocarpy is an alternative pathway to
normal fruit-set and development, in which the ovary
grows into fruit without fertilization and seed formation
(Lukyanenko, 1991), and can be artificially induced by the
application of hormones, mainly auxins and gibberellins
(GAs) (Goodwin, 1978; Schwabe and Mills, 1981). In the
case of natural parthenocarpy, it has been proposed to be
the result of conditions that induce a threshold concentra-
tion of growth substances in the ovary sufficient to pro-
mote growth in the absence of pollination and fertilization
(Nitsch, 1970).
There is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that
GAs may control, at least partially, fruit development in
seeded tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). First, fruit
growth can be induced by the application of GAs to un-
pollinated ovaries (Schwabe and Mills, 1981; Sawhney,
1984). Second, fruits containing GA-producing seeds are
larger than those with GA-deficient seeds (Groot et al.,
1987). Third, GAs of the early-13-hydroxylation (GA1, GA8,
GA17, GA19, GA20, GA29, and GA44) and of the non-13-
hydroxylation (GA9, GA15, GA24, and GA25) biosynthetic
pathways have been identified in developing pollinated
fruits (Bohner et al., 1988; Koshioka et al., 1994). These GAs
may be synthesized in the ovary itself, because genes cod-
ing for GA biosynthesis enzymes (copalyl diphosphate
synthase, GA 20-oxidase, and GA 3b-hydroxylase) are ex-
pressed in developing tomato flowers and fruit (Rebers et
al., 1999). Parthenocarpy in tomato may also depend on
GAs, because natural parthenocarpic fruits contain more
GA-like substances than their non-parthenocarpic counter-
parts early after anthesis (Mapelli et al., 1978), and tomato
fruits induced by the application of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic
acid (an auxin) also contain high levels of GAs (Koshioka et
al., 1994).
Natural parthenocarpy in tomato has been widely stud-
ied due to its potential use as a solution to poor fruit-set at
unfavorable environmental conditions (George et al., 1984).
Several genotypes carrying gene(s) inducing partheno-
carpy have been described and selected in tomato (Phi-
louze, 1983; George et al., 1984; Lukyanenko, 1991; Mazzu-
cato et al., 1998). Among the different sources of natural
parthenocarpy, the Russian cv Severianin obtained by So-
lovjeva (cited by Philouze, 1983) is of particular interest
because of its strong expressivity, its facultative character,
and its simple genetic control (Philouze et al., 1980). The
capability of cv Severianin to set seedless fruits with com-
plete locule fill under unfavorable environmental condi-
tions is mainly due to the pat-2 gene (Philouze and Mai-
sonneuve, 1978; Nuez et al., 1986; Vardy et al., 1989), which

induces a different protein in the ovary after anthesis (Barg
et al., 1990). The analysis by two-dimensional PAGE of in
vitro translation products of RNAs from flowers and ova-
ries before anthesis also shows a differential expression
associated to pat-2-induced parthenocarpy (Fos and Nuez,
1996; Fos and Nuez, 1997). This suggests that the molecular
events observed in pat-2 ovaries before anthesis, which are
associated with parthenocarpic fruit growth, may modify
the hormone content of the ovary before pollination.
In the present study, the possible role of GAs in parthe-
nocarpic tomato fruit development controlled by pat-2 has
been investigated at stages before fruit-set using near-
isogenic lines. The inhibition of fruit-set by paclobutrazol
and its reversal by GA3 suggested that fruit growth of both
seeded wild-type (wt) and parthenocarpic pat-2 tomato
depends on GAs. The quantification of endogenous GA
levels in developing tomato ovaries showed the accumula-
tion of very large amounts of GA20 in pat-2 ovaries before
anthesis. However, GA20 may not be active per se, because
the application of an inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
dioxygenases decreased parthenocarpic fruit development.
These results suggest that the parthenocarpic capability of
pat-2 ovaries may be the result of the accumulation of GA20,
leading to an early higher synthesis of active GA in the
absence of pollination and fertilization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material
Two non-parthenocarpic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
Mill.) lines, Madrigal (MA/wt) and Cuarenteno (CU/wt),
and their corresponding near-isogenic parthenocarpic lines
carrying the pat-2 gene, Par54-11 (MA/pat-2) and Par14-11
(CU/pat-2), were used in the experiments. The partheno-
carpic lines were generated in our laboratory from crosses
of MA/wt and CU/wt with the Russian cv Severianin
(source of pat-2) (Nuez et al., 1985). Line MA/pat-2 has
been backcrossed to the non-parthenocarpic line MA/wt
four times, and line CU/pat-2 is an F4 selection that was
then backcrossed three times with the non-parthenocarpic
CU/wt line.
The plants were grown during autumn-winter in an
air-conditioned greenhouse set at an average temperature
of 10°C in large containers (6 m 3 40 cm 3 50 cm depth; 18
plants per container) with sand (experiment of Fig. 1), or in
25-L pots containing a peat:soil (1:1) mixture irrigated with
nutrient solution. The temperatures fluctuated according to
the environment, but extremes were never higher than
21°C (day) or lower than 6°C (night).
Ovaries from flowers at the flower bud (FB), preanthesis
(PR), and anthesis (AN) stage, as previously described (Fos
and Nuez, 1996), were collected from the second to sixth
clusters for the determination of GAs (Table I). The ovaries
were frozen immediately in liquid N2 and stored at 280°C
until extraction.
Plant Hormone Application
Flowers from the second to fourth clusters were emas-
culated 1 d before anthesis to prevent self-pollination, and
2 to 3 d later the ovaries were treated with different
amounts of GA1 (Dr. Michel Beale, Long Ashton Research
Station, Long Ashton, UK), GA3 (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich
Quı´mica SA, Alcobendas, Spain), or GA20 (purchased from
Dr. L. Mander, Australian National University, Canberra)
at the concentrations specified in each experiment (in 20 mL
of 5% [v/v] methanol containing 0.1% [v/v] Tween 80,
applied directly to the ovary). Paclobutrazol (Imperial
Chemical Industries, Bracknell, UK; 5 mg per ovary), an
inhibitor of ent-kaurene oxidase, and 3,5-dioxo-4-butyryl-
cyclohexane carboxylic acid ethyl ester (LAB 198 999 [LAB],
BASF, Limburgerhof, Germany; at 1, 5, and 10 mm), an
acylcyclohexadione derivative that inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-
dependent dioxygenases (Rademacher et al., 1992), were
applied to pollinated MA/wt and unpollinated MA/pat-2
ovaries alone or together with GAs. Control ovaries were
treated with the same volume of solvent solution. Each
treatment was carried out on nine to 12 ovaries (three
to four plants, one cluster per plant, and three ovaries
per cluster).
Extraction and Purification of GAs
Frozen material, previously ground in a mortar with
liquid N2, was homogenized with a polytron homogenizer
(PT-10, Kinematica, Kriens-Luzern, Switzerland) in cold
80% (v/v) methanol (1:25, w/v), stirred for 12 h at 4°C, and
re-extracted twice for 30 min with one-half volume of
methanol. To determine recoveries during extraction and
purification and to allow GAs to be located during HPLC,
the following radioactive GAs were added to the homog-
enized samples: [3H2]GA1 (1.39 TBq mmol
21), 16,17-
dihydro[3H2]GA19 (2.45 TBq mmol
21), and [3H2]GA20 (1.41
TBq mmol21). Methanol was removed under vacuum at
40°C, and the aqueous residue purified by solvent parti-
tioning QAE-Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia, Milton Keynes,
UK) chromatography and C18-BondElut (500 mg; Varian,
Harbor City, CA), as described by Garcı´a-Martı´nez et al.
(1991).
Reverse-Phase HPLC
Dried samples were dissolved in 10% (v/v) methanol
(0.4 mL), injected onto a 4-mm C18 column (15 cm long, 3.9
mm i.d.; NovaPak, Millipore, Milford, MA), and eluted
with a linear gradient of 10% to 100% (v/v) methanol
containing 50 mL L21 (v/v) acetic acid over 40 min at 1 mL
min21. Fractions were grouped according to retention
times of radioactive GA markers and taken to dryness in
vacuo. Retention times of standards were 17 to 18 min for
GA1, 24 to 25 min for GA20, and 26 to 28 min for dihydro-
GA19.
GA Identification
GAs were identified in extracts of non-parthenocarpic
MA ovaries, collected from developing flowers before pol-
lination (from FB to AN stage). A total mixed population of
365 ovaries (3,535 mg fresh weight [FW]) were extracted
and purified as described above. Dried samples from pooled

HPLC fractions were dissolved in 0.5 mL of methanol and
methylated with ethereal diazomethane for 15 min at room
temperature. They were then dried in vacuo and trimethyl-
silylated with N-methyl-n-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 30 min at 90°C. GA20 was also
identified in extracts from a pool of MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2
ovaries (267 and 268, respectively) collected from flowers
from FB to AN.
The analyses were carried out with a gas chromatograph
(model 5890, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) coupled to a
mass-selective detector (model 5971A, Hewlett-Packard)
using an HP-1 capillary column (25 m long, 0.2-mm i.d.,
0.33-mm film thickness), under the conditions described by
Hedden et al. (1989). The samples (1 mL) were co-injected
with 0.1 mL of Parafilm extract in n-hexane to determine the
Kovats Retention Index (KRI) values (Gaskin et al., 1971).

The initial oven temperature was maintained at 60°C for 1
min and then increased at 20°C min21 to 240°C and at 4°C
min21 to 300°C. The MS ion source was operated at 70 eV
and 175°C to 185°C, the injector temperature at 220°C, and
the interface temperature at 280°C. The samples were run
using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.
GA Quantification
The samples were extracted and purified as described
above. The number and FW of ovaries collected for GA
quantification are shown in Table I, and aliquots of approx-
imately 300 mg FW were used for quantification. For these
analyses, the appropriate amounts of the following internal
standards were added to the samples at the time of extrac-
tion: [17-2H2]GA1, [17-
2H2]GA3, [17-
2H2]GA8, [17-
2H2]GA19, [17-
2H2]GA20, and [17-
2H2]GA29 (purchased
from Prof. L. Mander, Australian National University,
Canberra).
The chromatographic and spectrometric conditions de-
scribed above were also used in quantitative analysis. The
concentrations of GAs in the original extracts were deter-
mined from the peak area ratios of the following pairs of
ions: 506/508 for GA1, 504/506 for GA3, 594/596 for GA8,
434/436 for GA19, 418/420 for GA20, and 506/508 for GA29
by references to calibration curves. Additional ions were
also monitored to confirm the identify of the GAs quantified.
Statistical Methods
Statistical treatments of the data were made by analysis
of variance using the Fisher’s lsd procedure to discrimi-
nate among the means (Statgraphics Plus program, version
3.1 for Windows, Statistical Graphics, Rockville, MD).
RESULTS
Growth of Non-Parthenocarpic and
Parthenocarpic Ovaries
Unpollinated MA/wt and CU/wt ovaries grew very lit-
tle compared with pollinated ovaries, and abscised about
10 d after anthesis (Fig. 1). In contrast, unpollinated MA/
pat-2 and CU/pat-2 ovaries developed similarly to polli-
nated wt ovaries, leading to mature fruits essentially iden-
tical to wt seeded fruits except for the absence of seeds (Fig.
1). It is already known that the final weight of seedless and
seeded pat-2 fruits in both the MA and CU backgrounds are
similar (Nuez et al., 1991).
The application of GA3 (2 mg) induced set of unpolli-
nated MA/wt and CU/wt ovaries, and the final size and
weight of parthenocarpic wt fruits induced by GA3 were
similar to those developed from pollinated ovaries in CU
plants, but significantly smaller in MA plants (Fig. 1). The
application of GA3 did not alter the growth of unpollinated
MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2 ovaries (Fig. 1).
Inhibition of Tomato Fruit Growth with Paclobutrazol
The means of the final diameters and weights of polli-
nated MA/wt and parthenocarpic MA/pat-2 fruits were
not significantly different (Table II). However, the applica-
tion of paclobutrazol (5 mg) prevented the growth of both
pollinated MA/wt (all the ovaries abscised) and unpolli-
nated MA/pat-2 (only one ovary developed, although sig-
nificantly less than the control) ovaries and the application
of GA3 (2 mg) fully reverted this inhibition (Table II).
Identification of GAs in Tomato Ovaries before Pollination
The identification of GAs in an extract of developing
tomato ovaries (a mixed population from FB to AN) of the
non-parthenocarpic line MA/wt was carried out by com-
paring the relative abundance of at least five characteristic
ions and KRI values with those of authentic standards. The
following GAs of the early-13-hydroxylation biosynthetic
pathway could be identified: GA1, GA8, GA19, GA20, GA29,
GA44, and GA53. GA3, as well as two members of the
non-13-hydroxylation pathway, GA9 and GA34, were also
identified in young ovaries. In addition, a compound with
the same KRI as GA81, a 2a-hydroxy derivative of GA20,

The experiments were carried out on hand-pollinated (the day equivalent to anthesis) (wt) or
unpollinated (pat-2) tomato ovaries with MA genetic background. Paclobutrazol (5 mg) and GA3 (2 mg)
were applied in 20 mL of solution per ovary at the day equivalent to anthesis, and developed fruits (those
having a weight higher than 1 g) collected 65 to 68 d later. Control ovaries were treated with a similar

was also tentatively identified for the first time in tomato
(Table III).
Quantification of GAs from Tomato Ovaries
The content (nanograms per gram FW) of GA1, GA8,
GA19, GA20, and GA29 in ovaries from flowers at three
developmental stages (FB, PR, and AN) of the non-
parthenocarpic tomato lines MA/wt and CU/wt and their
respective near-isogenic parthenocarpic (pat-2) lines were
determined by GC-SIM (Fig. 2). GA3 was also quantitated
but it was always at very low level or undetected (results
not presented).
In non-parthenocarpic ovaries, the highest GA concen-
trations were found at the FB stage: about 40 to 50 ng g21
FW for GA19, 10 to 15 ng g
2 FW for GA20, 4 to 6 ng g
21 FW
for GA29, 2 to 4 ng g
21 FW for GA1, and 7 to 17 ng g
21 FW
for GA8. The concentrations of all GAs decreased progres-
sively during ovary development in the two non-
parthenocarpic lines. In the case of GA19, its content was
higher in non-parthenocarpic than in pat-2 ovaries (three to
five times higher with the MA background, and two to four
times higher with the CU background), except at the FB
stage with the MA background, which were very similar
(Fig. 2). In contrast, the level of GA20, the immediate prod-
uct of GA19 metabolism was clearly higher in pat-2 than in
wt ovaries at the three stages of flower development ana-
lyzed: between 10 and 160 times with the MA background,
and between five and 50 times higher with the CU back-
ground (Fig. 2). The concentration of GA20 was particularly
high and constant (about 100 ng g21 FW) in pat-2 ovaries
with MA background. The content of GA1 was higher in
pat-2 ovaries with MA (about 2- to 4-fold), but not with CU
background (where similar or higher GA1 levels were
found in non-parthenocarpic ovaries). The content of GA8
was lower in pat-2 than in non-parthenocarpic ovaries in
MA background at the FB stage (about 3-fold), and similar
at later developmental stages (Fig. 2), whereas with the CU
background it was higher (about 2-fold at PR and AN
stages) in pat-2 ovaries. The differences in the contents of
GA29 between non-parthenocarpic and pat-2 ovaries were
either not consistent (MA background) or not significant
(CU background, except at PR stage, where the pat-2 ova-
ries contained about three times less GA29).
To check that the m/z ion 418, used to quantitate GA20,
was not contaminated in pat-2 ovaries with a similar ion
from another compound with the same retention time as
GA20, extracts from pools of MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2 ova-
ries (from FB to AN flowers) were analyzed by GC-SIM
measuring the abundance of the same ions used to identify
GA20 in MA/wt ovaries (Table II). The results showed
clearly the presence of uncontaminated GA20 in both kinds
of pat-2 ovaries (Table IV).
Effect of GA1, GA20, and LAB on the Growth of
Unpollinated Tomato Ovaries
The application of GA1 (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg) induced
parthenocarpic growth of unpollinated MA/wt ovaries in a
dose-responsive manner, and 2 mg of GA20 had an effect
similar to the same amount of GA1 (Table V). Lower
amounts of GA20 (0.2 and 0.02 mg) were not active. The
effect of GA20 on parthenocarpic growth of MA/wt ovaries
was not affected by the simultaneous application of 1 mm

LAB, but it was significantly reduced by 5 mm LAB (Table
V), suggesting that GA20 needs to be metabolized to be
active. A higher concentration of the inhibitor (10 mm) did
not elicit further reduction of fruit-set and growth.
In MA/pat-2 ovaries, the application of GA1 or GA20 (2
mg) did not affect the growth of parthenocarpic fruits de-
veloped in the absence of pollination (Table VI, experiment
I), as was observed previously with GA3 (Fig. 1). The
smaller final size of the fruits in this experiment may be
due to the use of 25-L pots with a peat/soil mixture rather
than large containers with sand. LAB (1 mm) did not have
any effect when applied together with 2 mg GA20, as oc-
curred in MA/wt, whereas 5 mm LAB also significantly
reduced fruit-set and growth (Table VI, experiment I). In a
separate experiment, the application of 5 mm LAB alone
also inhibited significantly fruit-set and growth, and this
inhibition was fully reverted by the simultaneous applica-
tion of 2 mg of GA1 (Table VI, experiment II).
DISCUSSION
The application of GA3 induced fruit-set and develop-
ment of unpollinated ovaries in the non-parthenocarpic
tomato MA/wt and CU/wt lines (Fig. 1), which is in agree-

ment with previous results in different tomato cultivars
(Bu¨nger-Kibler and Bangerth, 1982; Sjut and Bangerth,
1982; Alabadı´ et al., 1996). GA1 and GA20 were also active
in inducing parthenocarpic fruit development, at least in
MA/wt (Table V). The application of paclobutrazol, an
inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, negated the development of
seeded MA/wt fruits, and this effect was fully counter-
acted by GA3 (Table II). These results suggest that GAs
may be involved in tomato fruit development. The final
size of GA3-induced fruits of the MA/wt tomato line were
smaller than seeded fruits, but those of the CU/wt tomato
line were not. This indicates that, depending on the genetic
background, more than a single application of GA3 may be
necessary to mimic the effect of pollination and fertiliza-
tion. Alternatively, other growth factors (e.g. auxins; Gil-
laspy et al., 1993) in addition to GAs may also be requested
for the normal fruit growth of tomato. Unpollinated ova-
ries of the MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2 lines developed simi-
larly to pollinated ovaries of their near-isogenic wt lines,
and their growth was not altered by GA3 treatment (Fig. 1).
The application of paclobutrazol prevented the growth of
seedless parthenocarpic MA/pat-2 ovaries, and this effect
was negated by the application of GA3 (Table II). This
indicates that parthenocarpic fruit-set and development in
pat-2 also depend on GAs, and suggests that the capacity of
pat-2 ovaries to set and develop may be due to their higher
content of active GAs in the absence of pollination and/or
fertilization, as found for the level of GA-like substances in
pat (another parthenocarpic gene) tomato fruits at early
stages of development (Mapelli et al., 1978).
The following members of the early-13-hydroxylation
pathway of GA biosynthesis: GA53, GA44, GA19, GA20,
GA29, GA1, and GA8, were identified in developing non-
parthenocarpic (MA/wt) tomato ovaries before anthesis
(Table III). These GAs, with the exception of GA53, plus
GA17 were previously identified in the pericarp of 20-d-old
fruits (Bohner et al., 1988) and in entire 10-d-old pollinated
fruits (Koshioka et al., 1994). GA3, previously identified in
vegetative tissues of tomato (Gru¨nzweig et al., 1997), has
now been found in unpollinated ovaries and, as in maize,
may come from GA20 via GA5 (Fujioka et al., 1990). The
identification of GA9 and GA34 (Table II), two members of
the non-13-hydroxylation pathway, supports that both bio-
synthetic pathways are present simultaneously in the ova-
ries before pollination (see Fig. 3). This is in contrast to
previous results showing that GA15, GA24, and GA25 (from
the non-13-hydroxylation pathway) were only present in
seeds of 20-d-old pollinated fruits (Bohner et al., 1988).

It has also been reported that GAs could not be detected
in pollinated tomato ovaries until several days after anthe-
sis (Koshioka et al., 1994). The presence of GAs in unpol-
linated ovaries, however, as shown in this work, suggests
that the developing ovaries are capable of GA biosynthesis.
This idea is supported by the recent observation that genes
coding for copalyl diphosphate synthase, GA 20-oxidase,
and GA 3b-hydroxylase are expressed during flower and
early fruit development in tomato, and that a GA 20-
oxidase gene (Le20ox-2) is localized in the placenta tissue of
young, unpollinated tomato ovaries (Rebers et al., 1999).
Our results also suggest that the GA biosynthetic capability
of the ovary may be reduced or disappear once it has
developed completely, around the time of anthesis, and be
triggered again as a consequence of pollination, because
the concentration of the quantitated GAs decreased pro-
gressively during ovary development in wt tomato plants
(Fig. 2). This agrees with previous results in pea, in which
GA8, GA19, and GA20, present in emasculated, unpolli-
nated ovaries, rapidly decreased in the absence of pollina-
tion (Garcı´a-Martı´nez et al., 1991).
The quantitation of GAs showed that the concentration
of GA20 in pat-2 ovaries before pollination was much
higher than in non-parthenocarpic ovaries (Fig. 2). This
difference was found at the three stages of ovary develop-
ment studied (FB, PR, and AN) and with two different
genetic backgrounds (MA and CU). The accumulation of
GA20 in pat-2 ovaries was confirmed by identifying this GA
by GC-SIM in both MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2 ovaries (Table
IV). Although the levels of GA29 and GA8 catabolite are not
known, the higher content of GA20 may not be due to a
blockage of GA20 metabolism. First, there was not, as
would be expected if the metabolism of GA20 to GA29 were
decreased, a large reduction in the amount of GA29 in pat-2
ovaries (Fig. 2). Second, the higher amount of GA1 (the
product of 3b-hydroxylation) in MA/pat-2 ovaries and a
similar or higher amount of GA1 plus GA8 (the metabolic
product of GA1) in CU/pat-2 ovaries do not support a
blockage of GA20 to GA1 metabolism. The accumulation of
GA20 in pat-2 ovaries may rather be due to a higher GA
20-oxidase activity, since the level of GA19 (the immediate
biosynthetic precursor of GA20) in pat-2 ovaries was gen-
erally much lower than in non-parthenocarpic ovaries (Fig.
2). The recent isolation of three GA 20-oxidase cDNA
clones of tomato, whose transcripts were detected in flower
buds and during early fruit development (Rebers et al.,
1999), should allow testing whether the expression of these
genes is enhanced in pat-2 ovaries.
The application of GA1 and GA20 to unpollinated
MA/wt tomato ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit
growth (Table V), but did not affect the parthenocarpic
growth of unpollinated pat-2 ovaries (Table VI). This indi-
cates that the endogenous content of active GA may be
saturating in pat-2 ovaries. However, GA20 does not seem
to be active by itself because the simultaneous application
of LAB, an inhibitor of GA20 metabolism, blocked the in-
duction by GA20 of parthenocarpy in wt ovaries (Table V).
Although the application of 5 mm LAB also inhibited the
parthenocarpy of unpollinated pat-2 ovaries, simultaneous
treatment with GA1 reversed this effect but a GA20 treat-
ment was ineffective (Table VI). This strongly suggests that
the effect of 5 mm LAB was due to its blockage of GA20
metabolism. Furthermore, the inhibition of MA/pat-2
ovary growth by LAB (Table VI) also suggests that the
accumulated GA20 needs to be converted to an active GA
for the expression of parthenocarpy of pat-2 ovaries.
It has been shown that GA1 is the active GA in the
control of stem elongation in many species (Graebe, 1987),
and there is considerable evidence suggesting that it also
regulates fruit-set and development in pea (Garcı´a-
Martı´nez and Hedden, 1997). GA20 is the immediate pre-
cursor of GA1 in many species (Graebe, 1987). The meta-
bolic biosynthetic pathway of GA1 in reproductive tomato
tissues, however, is still unknown, and GA4 as an alterna-
tive precursor, as suggested in pea fruit (Rodrigo et al.,
1997), cannot be fully discarded. However, the low GA
levels of members of the GA4 biosynthetic pathway in
young tomato fruit (Bohner et al., 1988; Koshioka et al.,
1994) suggest that the early-13-hydroxylation pathway is
the main operative pathway in the ovary and fruit (Fig. 3).
The MA/pat-2 unpollinated ovaries had a higher GA1 con-
tent than MA/wt ovaries (Fig. 2). In CU/pat-2 ovaries,
however, the content of GA1 was not higher than in the
corresponding non-parthenocarpic isoline, but they con-
tained more GA8, the metabolic product of GA1, and the
amount of GA1 plus GA8 was higher at the PR and AN
stages (Fig. 2).
A correlation between the level of [3H]GA8 produced
from applied [3H]GA20 and pea internode elongation has
also been found (Ingram et al., 1986), indicating that the
content of GA8 may be a measure of the previous GA1
content in the tissues. This suggests that pat-2 unpollinated
ovaries with the CU background may also synthesize more
GA1 than wt ovaries and that the flux of GA1 may be
important to induce parthenocarpic growth. Therefore,
pat-2, whose expression can be detected before pollination
(Fos and Nuez, 1996), may induce parthenocarpy by in-
creasing the content or production of active GA in unpol-
linated ovaries, probably as a result of the high accumula-
tion of GA20. A similar situation occurs in the pea sln
mutant, in which the blockage of conversion of GA20 to
GA29 and GA29 catabolite produces the accumulation of
GA20 in the mature seeds, leading to a high GA1 content in
young seedlings and to a slender phenotype (Ross et al.,
1995).
In conclusion, the results presented show that the pat-2
mutation produces the accumulation of GA20 in unpolli-
nated tomato ovaries. Natural parthenocarpy induced by
pat-2 is probably due to a higher synthesis of active GA
(e.g. GA1) in the developing unpollinated ovaries as a
result of the accumulation of GA20.
