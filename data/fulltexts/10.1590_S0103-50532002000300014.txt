The methanol extract of stems of Trichilia claussenii yielded three new sesquiterpenoids: 14-
hydroxyelemol, germacra-10(14)-en-9,11,15-triol and germacra-3,10(14)-dien-9,11-diol-4-
carbaldehyde. Two known sesquiterpenoids β-eudesmol, cryptomeridiol and the triterpenoid 22,25-
dihydroxy-9β,19-cyclolanost-23-en-3-one were also isolated. The dichloromethane extract from the
leaves of T. lepidota afforded a mixture of hydrocarbons (C

Introduction
The Meliaceae family has shown to be of much interest
among phytochemists because either it contains plants
which produce very complex chemical structures, or
because of their biological activity, mainly against insects.
As part of our interest in the chemistry of this family, we
have already reported the isolation of γ-lactones from the
fruits,1 androstane and pregnane steroids from the steams2
and cycloartane triterpenoids and a mixture of ω-phenyl
alkanoic and alkenoic acids from the leaves3 of Trichilia
claussenii collected in Brazil. In continuation of our study
of Trichilia species, we now report the isolation of five
sesquiterpenoids and a cycloartane triterpenoid from the
steams of T. claussenii and steroids from the leaves of T.
lepidota Martius ssp schumanniana Harms, which has
never been investigated before.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 and
100.62 MHz, respectively, in a Bruker DRX spectrometer.

O. DCCC was performed in an
Eyela Droplet Counter Current Chromatograph D.C.C. -
300. The GC-MS analyses were carried out with a Hewlett
Packard System 5995 fitted with a dimethylpolysiloxane
HP-1 (25 m x 0.20 mm i.d. x 0.30 film tickness) capillary
column, with hydrogen as the carrier gas. The temperature
was programmed initially at 120 oC for 2 min., then
increased with a rate of 8 oC min-1 to 280 oC and kept for
20 min. The injection volume was 1 µL in a split mode and
temperature of the injector was 280 oC.
Isolation of the constituents from T. claussenii
Stems (2.4 kg) of T. claussenii were collected in Rio
Claro, SP, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the
Herbarium of Instituto de Biociências, Universidade
Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil. The stems were
dried, powdered and extracted with MeOH. The MeOH
extract (45.7 g) was suspended in MeOH:H

of the dichloromethane fraction yielded three fractions.
Fr-1 (656 mg), after flash chromatography (n-
hexane:MeOH 49:1 v/v and n-hexane:Me
2
CO 99.4:0.6
v/v), was hydrolyzed with KOH (10%) in EtOH followed
by chromatography on silica flash (n-hexane:Me
2
CO 99:1
v/v), to afford 4 mg of phytol. Fr-2 (770 mg), after flash
chromatography and then prep-tlc (benzene:ethyl ether
99.6:0.4 v/v), afforded a mixture of sesquiterpenes:
caryophyllene and humulene epoxides (7.3 mg) and α-
tocopherol (1.3 mg), spathulenol (35.6 mg) and 24-
methylen-12β-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-palmitate (3.8 mg)
(8). Compound 8 was hydrolyzed with KOH (10%) in EtOH
to yield 7 and a mixture of lauric, palmitic and stearic
acids, which was methylated with diazomethane. Fr-3 (396

4:1 v/v) and then on florisil (n-hexane:EtOAc 4:1 v/v), to
yield 6 mg of a mixture of 24-methylenecholesterol,
campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol. Two fractions
eluted with EtOAc were chromatographed on florisil using
as eluent CH
2
Cl
2

7 (30 mg) and 9 (1.5 mg) that was further purified by
recycling-HPLC. The methanol extract was first submitted
to a liquid-liquid partition, followed by DCCC of the
MeOH fraction (4.4 g) using the mobile and stationary
phases obtained from the organic and aqueous layers,
respectively, of the mixture CHCl
3
:MeOH:H

Results and Discussion
The methanol extract of the stems of T. claussenii was
submitted to solvent partition followed by several column
chromatographies. This procedure led to the isolation and
characterization of five sesquiterpenoids: two known
eudesmane derivatives, β-eudesmol (1), and
cryptomeridiol (2), one new elemane derivative, 14-
hydroxyelemol (3), two new germacrane derivatives,
germacra-10(14)-en-9,11,15-triol (4) and germacra-
3,10(14)-dien-9,11-diol-4-carbaldehyde (5), and one
cycloartane triterpenoid, 22,25-dihydroxy-9β,19-
cyclolanost-23-en-3-one (6). The structures of the
compounds were identified on the basis of their spectral
data and comparison with compounds reported in the
literature.
The data reported for β-eudesmol4 and cryptomeridiol5,6
confirmed the structures for 1 and 2. Other possible isomers
for 2 were ruled out through comparison with authentic
compounds reported in the literature.6,7
Compound 3 was established from 1H and 13C NMR
spectral data. The IR spectrum suggested the presence of
hydroxyl groups (3401 cm-1). The 13C NMR spectrum
showed 15 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons

. The signals at δ 71.6 (s) and δ  61.5
(d) were attributed to carbinolic carbons, allowing us to

 for compound 3.
In the MS the parent ion observed, m/z 220, does not
represent the molecular ion which was expected to be m/z
238, due to the loss of one molecule of water. The
PENDANT spectrum showed four olefinic carbons at δ
148.0 (d), 147.7 (s), 113.2 (t) and 112.5 (d). The remaining
unsaturations suggested that 3 was a monocyclic
sesquiterpenoid. The proton signals at δ 1.39 (s) and 1.40
(s) in the 1H NMR spectrum and at δ 27.4 (q), 27.8 (q) and
71.6 (s) in the PENDANT spectrum suggested the presence
of a 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group, which was confirmed
in the mass spectrum by the fragment m/z 59. In the 1H-1H
COSY experiment of 3, H-1 (δ 6.10, dd) was coupled to
two H-2 (δ 5.20, dd and 5.36, dd). Both H-2 were coupled
to each other. These olefinic signals suggested a vinyl
group connected to a quaternary carbon. The olefinic
protons H-3 (δ 4.95 and 4.79) were not coupled to other
protons and the signals for C-3 (δ 112.5, t) and C-4 (δ
147.7, s) suggested an exomethylene group, where a methyl
group H-15 (δ 1.78, s) is attached to C-4. These data
together with consideration of isoprene rule led us to
propose a sesquiterpene elemane derivative for 3. The 1H
NMR spectrum of 3 also showed an AX coupling system
(δ 4.29, 4.03, both d, J 10.8 Hz) and the 13C NMR showed
a carbinolic carbon at δ 61.5 (t), which led us to suggest
that methyl group (C-14) was replaced by a
hydroxymethylene group. Other carbon data are described
in Table 1. The attribution of the carbon signals was based
on related elemanes from the literature.8,9 Acetylation of 3
with acetic anhydride in pyridine provided the monoacetate
of the primary alcohol (3a). The relative configurations of
3 were proposed on basis on the biogenesis of the elemane
derivatives.10
Compound 4 was also found to be a monocyclic
sesquiterpenoid. The IR spectrum suggested the presence
of hydroxyl groups (3396 cm-1). The 13 C NMR showed 15
carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons
determined by PENDANT led to the attribution of 2 C, 3
CH, 8 CH
2
 and 2 CH
3
, of which 3 were carbinolic carbons:
δ 72.8 (d, C-9), 72.2 (s, C-11) and 67.4 (t, C-15). The carbon
signals at δ 153.2 (s, C-10) and 111.2 (t, C-14) suggested
the presence of an exomethylene group. The molecular
formula proposed for 4 was C
15
H
28
O
3
. The 1H NMR
spectrum showed the olefinic proton signals at δ 5.66 (br.
s, H-14a) and 5.27 (br. s, H-14b). The 1H-1H COSY spectrum
showed that both carbinolic protons at δ 3.77 (dd, H-15a)
and 3.66 (dd, H-15b) were coupled to each other and
coupled to another proton at δ 2.25 (m, H-4). The HMBC
experiment showed the correlation of the carbinolic proton
at δ 4.59 (br. t, H-9) with the olefinic carbons C-10 and C-
14, therefore H-9 should be carbinolic and allylic. The 1H-
1H COSY experiment showed that H-9 was coupled with
two protons at δ 2.36 (dt, H-8a) and 1.97 (dt, H-8b), which
are both coupled to each other and coupled to another
proton at δ 2.22 (m, H-7). The HMBC experiment showed
that H-9 was also correlated with C-7 (δ 41.8) and C-1
(32.9). The presence of a 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group
was also characterized by the correlation of the methyl
proton signals at δ 1.30 (s, H-12) and 1.40 (s, H-13) with
the quaternary carbinolic carbon at δ 72.2 (C-11) in the
HMBC experiment and the fragment m/z 59 in the mass
spectrum. The possible bisabolane structure for compound
4 was ruled out by these correlations in addition to the
correlations of C-11 with H-7 and C-7 with methyl protons
(H-12 and H-13), which confirmed a germacrane structure
for the sesquiterpenoid 4. The chemical shifts for C-12
and C-13 are very close for compounds 1 (∆δ 0.1), 2 (∆δ
0.6) and 3 (∆δ 0.4), and more distinct for 4 (∆δ 5.1). This
difference may be due to the hydrogen bond between the
hydroxyl groups at C-9 and C-11, which might fix a
preferential conformation. The chemical shifts observed
for C-12 and C-13 for acetates 4a (∆δ 1.5), 4b (∆δ 2.1),
and 4c (∆δ 1.3) suggested that the hydrogen bond is
stronger when hydroxy group at C-9 is not esterified.
The IR spectrum of 5 suggested the presence of
hydroxyl (3417 cm-1) and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
(1684 cm-1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two
methyl groups at δ 1.14 (s, H-12) and 1.08 (s, H-13), one
carbinolic and allylic proton at δ 4.26 (t, H-9) and three
olefinic protons at δ 6.47 (dd, H- 3), 5.12 (br. s, H-14), and
5.06 (br. s, H-14). A signal at δ 9.38 (d, H-15) suggested the
presence of an aldehyde group. The 13C NMR spectrum of
5 showed 15 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the
carbons determined by DEPT led to the attribution of: 3 C,
4 CH, 6 CH
2
 and 2 CH
3
. Four olefinic carbons were observed
at δ 150.0 (d, C-3), 142.0 (s, C-4), 148.9 (s, C-10), and
115.5 (t, C-14), indicating the presence of two double
bonds, including one exomethylene group. The signal at
δ 195.2 (d, C-15) confirmed the presence of an aldehyde
group. Two carbinolic carbons were observed at δ 72.8 (d,
C-9) and 73.0 (s, C-11). The molecular formula proposed
for 5 was C
15

O
3
. In the MS the parent ion observed,
m/z 234, does not represent the molecular ion which was
expected to be m/z 252, due to the loss of one molecule of
water. Compound 5 was also found to be a germacrane
sesquiterpenoid and the spectral data suggested the
presence of one 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group, similar
to the other sesquiterpenoids described before. The
chemical shifts for the olefinic proton (δ 6.47) and olefinic
387Terpenoids and Steroids from Trichilia SpeciesVol. 13, No. 3, 2002
methine carbon (δ 150.0) suggested that this double bond
should be conjugated with the aldehyde carbonyl group.
The location of the double bond between C-4 and C-5 was
ruled out mainly through analysis of the NMR data. The
1H-1H COSY experiment showed that the olefinic proton
(δ 6.47, H-3) was coupled to two allylic protons at δ 2.80
(H-2a) and 2.36 (H-2b). These allylic protons are also
coupled to another two allylic protons at δ 2.58 (H-1a)
and 2.52 (H-1b). These couplings are not possible for the
double bond ∆4,5.
The complete assignment of the protons and carbons
of the new sesquiterpenoids 4 and 5 was done on basis on
HMBC, HMQC and 1H-1H COSY data, Table 1 and 2. A
closely related germacrane-type sesquiterpenoid of 5, 6-
hydroxy-5-methylene-8-isopropenylcyclodec-1-
enecarbaldehyde, has been recently described and isolated
from Leitneria floridana (Leitneriaceae).11
It is proposed that elemanes, germacranes and
eudesmanes might share the same biogenetic pathway,
which involves Cope rearrangement of germacranes to
elemanes.10 The Cope rearrangement of germacranolides
to elemanolides has been investigated.12 Eudesmanolides
were also produced in this approach. The co-occurrence of
elemanes, germacranes and eudesmanes in T. claussenii is
a good evidence that the biogenetic pathway of these
sesquiterpenoids involves a single precursor.
The IR spectrum of 6 suggested the presence of
hydroxyl (3431 cm-1) and carbonyl (1702 cm-1) groups.
The 13C NMR spectrum showed 30 carbon signals. The
multiplicities of the carbons determined by DEPT 135o
led to the attribution of: 7 C, 7 CH, 9 CH
2
 and 7 CH
3
,
which suggested that 6 was a triterpenoid. The 1H NMR
spectrum showed an AB coupling system at δ 0.79 and
0.58 (both d, J 4.4 Hz), characteristic for H-19 of the
cyclopropane ring of the cycloartane triterpenoids. In the
13C NMR spectrum, the signal at δ 216.7 (s) suggested the
presence of a ketonic carbonyl group at C-3. The signals
of the α-carbonyl protons were observed at δ 2.30 (ddd, J
2.4, 4.4, 14.0 Hz, H-2α) and 2.71 (dt, J 6.4, 14.0, 14.0 Hz,
H-2β). The olefinic proton signals of the side chain were
observed at δ 5.85 (dd, H-24) and 5.71 (dd, H-23). The
chemical shift of H-22 (δ 4.22) suggested that this proton
should be carbinolic and allylic. The 1H-1H COSY
experiment showed that H-22 was coupled with two olefinic
protons at δ 5.85 and 5.71, and with another proton at δ
1.45 (H-20). In the 1H-1H COSY experiment, the olefinic
protons were coupled to each other and to the carbinolic
proton. The quaternary carbinolic carbon signal at δ 70.8
led us to propose one hydroxyl group at C-25. A similar
compound has been reported as a diglucosylcycloartane
showing the same side chain of 6.12 We have already
reported the isolation and identification of cycloartane
triterpenoids from the leaves of T. claussenii.3
Chromatography of the dichloromethane extract from
leaves of T. lepidota yielded a mixture of hydrocarbons as
the less polar compounds, besides sesquiterpenoids and
several steroids. The mixture of hydrocarbons was analyzed
through GC/MS, leading to the identification of three main
components C

The 1H NMR spectrum of the steroid 7, 24-methylene-
12β-hydroxycholesterol, showed a pair of broad singlets
(δ 4.61 and 4.67), characteristics of a double bond in the
side chain and signals of carbinolic protons (dd, δ 3.39
and m, δ 3.50); this was confirmed by its 13C NMR
spectrum (δ 79.7 and 71.9). These data allowed us to
propose the structure of a steroid for this molecule, which
contains two hydroxyl groups, one of those located at C-
3. The location of the second hydroxyl was based on the
13C NMR spectrum, where a signal at δ 8.1 (Me) was
attributed to C-18, requiring the hydroxyl attached to C-
12. Moreover, the hydroxyl should also occupy a β
position, being cis to Me-18. After acetylation, the 1H-1H
COSY experiment showed crosspeaks between a doublet
(Me, δ 0.89) and a multiplet (δ 1.4), two methyl signals (d,
δ 1.03) with an allyl proton (δ 2.34). These observations
led us to propose a 24-double bond; the double doublet at
δ 3.40 showed a shift to  4.70, with J 6.8 and 11.2 Hz, which
confirms the β-configuration of the 12-OH. This was
corroborated by the presence of a γ-gauche effect between
the hydroxyl group on C-12 and the methyl group (C-18,
δ 8.1). The steroid 8 showed to be very closely related to 7.
The main difference observed in the 1H NMR of 8, when
compared to 7, is the down field shift observed in the signal
of H-3 (m, δ 4.61) and an extra signal (br. s, δ 1.26) indicating
a linear long methylene chain. Compound 8 was
hydrolyzed under basic conditions yielding 7, besides a
mixture of fatty acids, which was methylated with
diazomethane and analyzed by GC/MS. The methyl esters
of palmitic, lauric and stearic acid where identified in the
mixture in a ratio obtained by GC of 8:1:1. The steroid 9
was also very closely related to 7 and 8; the main difference
found in the 1H NMR spectrum was the replacement of the
hydroxyl at C-3 by an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system,
like stigmast-4-en-3-one14. The IR spectrum confirmed the
presence of the carbonyl group (1680 cm-1). Therefore,
this compound was identified as 24-methyl-12β-hydroxy-
cholest-4-en-3-one (9). The other steroids were identified
mainly by 1H NMR and GC/MS data, through comparison
with the literature15 as 24-methylenecholesterol,
campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol.
The aminoacid N-methyl-4-hydroxyproline was also
isolated from T. lepidota. Comparison of the data obtained
388 Pupo et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
and the literature16 showed the identity of both compounds.
The sesquiterpenes spathulenol and a mixture of
caryophyllene epoxide with humulene epoxide,17 were also
isolated from the same plant.
