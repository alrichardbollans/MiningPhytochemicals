A novel nortriterpene, acanthochlamic acid (6), along with 18 known compounds has been isolated from the 
whole plants of Acanthochlamys bracteata P. C. Kao, a single species in family Acanthochlamydaceae which is 
endemic to the southwest of China. The structure of the novel nortriterpene was elucidated as 3,4-seco-3-nor- 
lup-4(23),20(29)-dien-2,28-dioic acid by spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and 
confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

Introduction 
The family Acanthochlamydaceae, comprising a 
single genus and a single species of Acanthochlamys 
bracteata P. C. Kao, is endemic to the southwest of 
China.1-3 A primary investigation of the chemical con-
stituents of A. bracteata was conducted in our labora-
tory and only 6 known compounds have been isolated.4 
During the search for the chemotaxonomical evidence 
of establishing the endemic family, the chemical con-
stituents of the whole plants of A. bracteata have been 
isolated again. A novel nortriterpene, acanthochlamic 
acid (6), together with 18 known compounds has been 
isolated from the alcoholic extract of the whole plants. 
We report herein the isolation and structure elucidation 
of these compounds.  
Results and discussion 
Compound 6 was obtained as colorless crystals and 
shown to have a molecular formula of C29H44O4 ac-
cording to high-resolution electrospray ionization mass 
spectrometry (HRESIMS, m/z 479.3163 [M＋Na]＋, 
calcd. 479.3137), indicating eight degrees of unsatura-
tion. The IR spectrum of 6 exhibited absorptions of 
carboxylic acid (1700, 1406 and 929 cm－1) and unsatu-
rated carbon-carbon bonds (3070, 1635, 893 and 875   
cm
－1). The NMR spectra suggest a structure with 29 
carbon atoms comprising two terminal olefinic bonds 
[δH: 4.58, 4.70 (H-29), 4.84, 4.87 (H-23) and δC: 109.6 
(C-29), 150.3 (C-20), 114.4 (C-23), 147.0 (C-4)], two 
carboxylic groups [δH: 12.00, 12.01 and δC: 173.1 (C-2), 
177.2 (C-28)] and five tertiary methyls [δH: 0.75 (H-25), 
0.92 (H-27), 0.93 (H-26), 1.65 (H-30), 1.70 (H-24) and 
δC: 14.3 (C-26), 15.5 (C-27), 19.0 (C-30), 19.4 (C-25), 
22.6 (C-24)]. In addition to the above carbon signals, 
the 13C NMR spectrum (including DEPT) exhibited the 
signals of nine methylenes, four methines and five qua-
ternary carbons. All the spectral data suggested that 6 
should be a nortriterpene. One isopropenyl group was 
attached to a five-membered ring, with δH 4.58, 4.70 
assigned to the vinylic methylene, δH 1.65 to the at-
tached methyl, and δH 1.55 to the allylic carbinyl proton. 
The other isopropenyl group was attached to a 
six-membered ring, with δH 4.84, 4.87 assigned to the 
vinylic methylene, δH 1.70 to the attached methyl, and 
δH 2.59 to the allylic carbinyl proton. Comparing the 
NMR data of 6 with those published for betulinic acid,5 
rings C, D and E were so similar that it was supposed to 
be a lupane-type triterpene. The betulinic acid has only 
one isopropenyl group and one carboxylic group. But 
signals of NMR indicated that there are double isopro-
penyl groups and carboxylic groups in 6. The presence 
of an extra isopropenyl group and carboxylic group 
suggested the cleavage of ring A in 6 between C-2 and 
C-3, followed by the lost of C-3 to form an isopropenyl 
group and C-2 was oxidized to a carboxylic group. In 
the HMBC experiment (Figure 1), the correlation sig-
nals between H-1 (δ 2.20 and 2.07, d, J＝15.0 Hz) at-
tached to a carboxylic group and C-5 (δ 48.8, d) and 
C-25 (δ 19.4, q) proved the cleavage of ring A. Fur-
thermore, those between H-23 (δ 4.87 and 4.84, s) and 
C-5 (δ 48.8, d) and C-24 (δ 22.6, q) confirmed the 
cleavage of ring A. The correlation signals between the 
two protons of H-29 (δ 4.58 and 4.70, s) and C-30 (δ 
19.0, q) were observed too. The relative stereochemistry 
of 6 was confirmed by 2D NOESY experiment (Figure 
2). The moiety of CH2COOH attached to C-10 was as-
signed to be α-oriented due to the NOESY correlation 
between H3-25 and H3-26. The NOESY correlation be-
tween H-5 and H-9 indicated the β-orientation of the 
isopropenyl group at C-5. H-5, H-9 and H-18 were 
proved to be α-oriented since they showed NOESY 
correlations with H3-27. The NOESY correlation signals 
between H-13 and both H3-26 and H-19 indicated the

α-orientation of isopropenyl group at C-19. The NO-
ESY correlation signals between Ha-22 and both H-18 
and H-29 showed that 28-COOH was β-oriented. All 
chiral centers of 6 were proved to be consistent with 
those of betulinic acid.5  
In addition, a colorless crystal of 6 was selected for 
X-ray analysis. The X-ray data confirmed the structure 
of 6 and further revealed that in the crystal structure the 
conformation of 6 is in accordance with those of the 
betulinic acid.

1H and 13C NMR data with those of literatures. Among 
them, only 3, 4, 5, 7, 12 and 17 were isolated from this 
plant before.  
Experimental 
General procedures 
Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin- 
Elmer model 341 polarimeter. IR spectra were recored 
on a Perkin-Elmer FTIR spectrometer as a film on a 
KBr plate. 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a 
Bruker AV-600 spectrometer with reference to internal 
TMS. All NMR experiments were conducted by using 
standard pulse sequences supplied by the vendor. 
HR-ESI-MS was recorded on an API GSTAR PUL-
SARI spectrometer and ESI-MS was on a Finnigan 
LCQDECA spectrometer. Melting points were measured 
on an XRC-1 apparatus and uncorrected. Column chro-
matography (CC) was carried out on silica gel (160—
200 and 200—300 mesh, Qingdao Haiyang Co.), Lobar 
Lichroprep Rp-8, Rp-18 and Si-60 columns (40—68 µm, 
Merck), MCI-Gel CHP-20P (75—150 µm, Mitsubishi 
Chemical Co.) and Sephdex LH-20 (Pharmacia Co.).  
Plant material 
The whole plants of A. bracteata were collected 
from Mount Yazhuo, Sichuan, China in July, 2002 and 
identified by Gao B. C. The voucher specimen 
(CIB200250) was deposited at the Herbarium of 
Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences.  
Extraction and isolation 
The air-dried and powdered whole plants of A. 
bracteata (25 kg) were extracted with EtOH at room 
temperature (7×3 days). The solvent was evaporated 
under reduced pressure evaporation to yield the dark 
residue (440 g). The extract was suspended in water 
(1000 mL) and extracted with petroleum ether (3×1000 
mL), EtOAc (3×1000 mL) and n-BuOH (3×1000 mL) 
sequentially. The extract of petroleum ether (160 g) was 
submitted to silica gel column chromatography (CC) 
(silica gel 1.5 kg, petroleum ether/acetone, V∶V, 
100 1∶ →1 1) and fractioned to ∶ five parts: Fr. I (43 g),
