Thus at the shorter time-interval the main
change is a general dephosphorylation resulting in
an increase of the monophosphates at the expense
of the triphosphates, whereas at the longer time-
interval there appears to be a catabolic breakdown
which results in the depletion in the triphosphates
alone, an effect which is particularly marked with
the 'ATP' peak.
Whether the dephosphorylation of UTP and
GTP is secondary to a lowering of the ATP con-
centration or whether it is due to an increased
enzymic dephosphorylation cannot be determined
from the present results; nor is it possible to
determine whether the dephosphorylation is a
result or a cause of the mitotic inhibition. Never-
theless, the finding that treatment with colchicine
leads to a very significant reduction in the con-
centration of ATP in the tissue is consistent with
those schemes which envisage a role for ATP in
mitosis and for the idea that the inhibitory action
of colchicine on mitosis is effected by its action on
the concentration of tissue ATP. In this connexion
it is interesting to contrast the effect of Myleran on
the liver acid-soluble nucleotides with that of
colchicine. Although Myleran is a powerful in-
hibitor of mitotic activity it has almost no effect
on the concentration of any of the individual acid-
soluble ribonucleotides, and it would appear that
this substance may well produce its inhibitory effect
by a mechanism different from that of colchicine.
SUMMARY
1. The concentrations of the acid-soluble ribo-
nucleotides in the livers of normal and partially
hepatectomized rats and of normal and partially
hepatectomized rats treated with either colchicine
or MyIeran have been measured.
2. Although. the treatment with drugs had
little effect on the majority of the nucleotides,
colchicine caused the concentrations of NAD and
AMP to increase and those of ATP, GTP and UTP
to decrease.

DISTRIBUTION OF INOSITOL DURING THE GERMINATION OF THE DWARF BEAN,
PHASEOLUS VULGARIS
BY L. N. GIBBINS* AND F. W. NORRIS
Department of Biochemi8try, Univeraity of Birmingham
(Received 18 May 1962)
Previous papers from these Laboratories dis-
cussed the determination of inositol in germinating
oats (Darbre & Norris, 1956) and in the seed and
young plants of the French bean (Darbre & Norris,
1957). Studies on inositol in germinating seeds
have been described by Burkholder & McVeigh
(1945a, b), Cheldelin & Lane (1943), Hinton (1942,
1947), Hinton, Peers & Shaw (1953) and Richardson
& Axelrod (1957); but to date there is little informa-
tion on the distribution of inositol in the dissected
anatomical parts of the seed and young plant.
The present work is an extension of that de-
scribed by Darbre & Norris (1957) and is a compre-
hensive survey of the distribution of total and free
inositol in six anatomical parts of the germinating
seed and seedlings of Phaseolu8 vulgaris at six
morphologically distinct stages of growth taking
place in total darkness.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
The seeds used were of the dwarf French bean, Phaseolus
vulgaria var. Improved Canadian Wonder.

INOSITOL IN BEAN SEEDS AND PLANTS
Germination. The germination and early development of
the bean seedling was divided into six stages: (1) Dormant
ungerminated seed. (2) Steeped turgid seed (1-2 days).
(3) Elongated radicle, 1-5 cm. (3 days). (4) Appearance of
lateral roots; radicle 7-5 cm., plumule 0-8 cm. (5 days).
(5) Extension of hypocotyl; plumule 1-2 cm., hypocotyl
6 cm. (7-8 days). (6) Exhaustion of cotyledons; hypocotyl
12 cm., epicotyl 5 cm. (12-14 days).
The seeds were rendered turgid by steeping in running
water at 12-15° for 24-48 hr. They were then laid out on
moist filter paper supported in vacuum desiccators and
aerated by using a small compressor. For plants required at
stage 4 and later, the seedlings were transferred to layers of
gauze pegged out on large photographic trays containing
water about 1 in. deep. Complete darkness was maintained
throughout germination.
Sampling. The seedlings were removed from the ger-
minating trays at the required stage of germination and
dissected into their various anatomical parts. The number
of each part taken, usually in excess of 100, provided a
representative sample from which the mean weight per
part could be determined. The samples were weighed,
quickly freeze-dried, ground in a mortar and pestle and
reweighed. The dry powders were stored in sealed bottles
until required for moisture and inositol assay.
Method8
Moisture. After many trials with different weights,
temperatures and times, the following procedure was found
to give satisfactory and reproducible results: 0-25 g. of
sample, in a small glass dish, was heated in an electric oven
at 1000 for 6 hr.
Inositol. Total and free inositol were determined by
microbiological assay, Schizosaccharomyces pombe being
used as test organism (Norris & Darbre, 1956; Darbre &
Norris, 1957). Total inositol was measured after hydrolysis
of the sample with N-HCI at 1230 for 48 hr.
All contents are reported as ,ug. of inositol/g. dry wt. or
as p&g. of inositol/mean wt. of dissected part.
RESULTS
The dry weights and inositol contents of the
bean plants throughout the six stages of germina-
tion are show-n in Table 1.
Whole plant. The total inositol content of the
plant falls after stage 3 until, at stage 6, 40% has
disappeared. Simultaneously there is a 'respiration
loss' of 30 % in the dry weight of the plant. The
free inositol content rises quite sharply in the
early stages, and, at stage 6, over 50% of the total
inositol content is in the free state. There is a con-
comitant loss of bound inositol,
Cotyledon8. The dry weight of the cotyledons
remains fairly constant until stage 3, after which
loss commences until only about 25% of the
original weight remains at stage 6. The total
inositol content (peg./part) also decreases from
stage 3, and during the later stages of development
free inositol increases greatly at the expense of
bound forms.
5
Plumules. No chanige in dry weight of the
plumules occurs until stage 3, but thereafter it
increases quite rapidly, to 23 times the original, at
stage 6. The total inositol content also increases
from stage 3, owing largely to a rise in free inositol
content, the bound forms making a relatively small
contribution.
Roots. Dry weight of the roots increases after
stage 3 with a concomitant rise in total inositol
content. The free and bound forms both show an
increase, but, contrary to the observation made
with the plumules, by far the greater part of the
increase in total inositol is due to bound forms.
Testas. The leaching action of the water in the
steeping process accounts for a 54 % loss of total
inositol in the testas. High colour and turbidity of
extracts prohibited assay of free inositol in the
testas of ungerminated beans, and in the later
stages of germination the amounts of free inositol
were beyond the lower limits of assay. After
stage 2 the total inositol content and dry weight
remain virtually unchanged.
Epicotyl1 and hypocotyls. These structures could
be dissected only at the later stages of germination.
The rapid elongation of the plant which takes place
at stages 5 and 6 is amply reflected in the increase
in dry weight of the hypocotyl between these
stages. There is a parallel rise in total inositol
content, and, as in the plumules, the increase is
largely due to free inositol. The epicotyls, at stage 6,
also contain a high proportion of free inositol.
DISCUSSION
The total inositol content of the whole bean
shows a marked fall during the first 2 weeks of
growth. This phenomenon has been observed during
the germination of cabbage, maize, mung bean,
pea, soya bean and wheat when grown in the light,
and in etiolated pea and mung-bean seedlings
(Richardson & Axelrod, 1957) and in oats (Darbre
& Norris, 1956), Several authors have described
changes in inositol content during germination and
early development of seedlings (Burkholder, 1943;
Cheldelin & Lane, 1943); but valid and convincing
results had to await the development of satis-
factory methods for the extraction and assay of
inositol.
Recently, pathways whereby inositol is incor-
porated into the cycles of carbohydrate metabolism
have been described for the rat kidney (Charal-
ampous, Bumille & Graham, 1958), and for
Schwanniomyces occidentalis (Sivan & Hoffmann-
Ostenhof, 1961), but little is known of its fate
within the plant. Although Fernandez, Izquierdo
& Martinez (1944) reported the presence in
Lactuca virmsa of an enzyme, cyclase, which would
effect the conversion of glucose into inositol, this

claim has not been substantiated. Fischer (1945)
suggested that phytin is a storage form for carbo-
hydrate as well as phosphate and intimated that
inositol could be easily converted into glucose.
A metabolic link between inositol and the sugars
and sugar acids associated with pectin and hemi-
celluloses is indicated by the production from
labelled inositol in strawberry fruit and parsley
leaves of D-galacturonosyl units ofpectin, and other
products such as D-xylose and the D-arabinosyl
and D-xylosyl residues of hemicelluloses. It is
suggested that inositol is converted into D-
glucuronic acid in plant tissues (Loewus, Kelly &
Neufeld, 1962).
The relatively small amount of phytin inositol in
the bean compared with total reserve carbohydrates
(Greenshields, 1961) suggests that the metabolic
removal of inositol during the germination and
early development of the plant under etiolated
conditions is a function of cellular economy rather
than cellular necessity.
The leaves and roots show an increase in their
respective total inositol contents, but whereas in
the leaves this rise is due to an influx of free ino-
sitol, that in the roots is due to bound forms. This
may reflect the functional differences, in the
physiological sense, of the two structures. It is well
known that inositol hexaphosphate appears to
have a particular affinity for Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+
ions in the phytin complex. The root system is
involved in the ion uptake of the plant, and the
presence of relatively large amounts of inositol
phosphates in the roots may be exerting an in-
fluence on the ionic balance.
The overall picture obtained in this study is of
the release, within the cotyledons, of inositol from
phytin by the enzyme phytase, some properties of
which will be reported later. Subsequently, ino-

sitol is drained away from the cotyledons and
translocated to the growing parts of the plant.
Whether inositol is translocated in the free state, or
in some combined form, is not known at present,
but the metabolic fate of inositol during the early
development of the bean seedling seems to depend
on the site to which translocation takes place.
SUMMWARY
1. The inositol content of each anatomical part
of the bean seedling has been determined, by
microbiological assay, at each of six stages during
the early development of the plant.
2. The total inositol content of the bean seedling
decreases by 40% during the first 2 weeks ofgrowth
in the dark.
3. Inositol is liberated from its bound forms
(phytin) in the cotyledons and translocated to the
growing parts of the plant.
4. The inositol content of the plumules increases
20-fold during early development of the plant, the
greater part ofthe increase being due to free inositol.
5. The increase in content of the roots (about
eightfold) is due mainly to bound forms of inositol.
6. The testas do not appear to play any part in
the metabolism of inositol during germination.
7. The hypocotyls show an increase in total
inositol content, mainly due to an influx of free
inositol. The epicotyls behave similarly.

Phytase and Acid Phosphatase in the Dwarf Bean, Phaseolus vulgaris
BY L. N. GIBBINS* AND F. W. NORRIS
Department of Biochemi8try, Univer8ity of Birmingham
(Received 18 May 1962)
A comprehensive review of phytase has appeared
(Sloane-Stanley, 1961) and the acid phosphatases
have also been discussed (Morton, 1961). In the
present paper some properties of phytase and a
purified acid phosphatase in the dwarf French
bean are presented, together with some observa-
tions on these activities in the early stages of
metabolism of the developing plant.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
The plant used was the dwarf French bean, Phaseolus
vulgaris var. Improved Canadian Wonder.
Enzyme 8ubstrates. A commercial preparation of sodium
phytate was recrystallized from water. The crystalline
product was dried in vacuo for several days and ground to a
white powder, which was moisture-free and contained no
free phosphate. Chromatography revealed the presence of
only one P-containing compound. This preparation was
used as a substrate (1 mm) for phytase assays.
Disodium phenyl phosphate was used as substrate for
acid-phosphatase assays.
Diethylaminoethyl(DEAE)-cellulose was prepared ac-
cording to the method of Peterson & Sober (1956) and
stored as a dry powder until required.
Calcium phosphate gel was prepared according to Dixon
& Webb (1958) and stored for at least a month before use.
Buffer sy8tems. Stock buffer solutions were prepared
according to the data of Gomori (1955) except that concen-
trations were increased to 1-0m. The following systems were
used, over the pH ranges indicated: pH 2-0-3-5, glycine-
