Vernalization of Thlaspi arvense 1. results in the alteration of 
gibberellin (CAI metabolism such that the metabolism and turnover 
of the CA precursor ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (kaurenoic acid) 
i s  dramatically increased. lhis cold-induced change in CA metab- 
olism is restricted to the shoot tip, the site of perception of cold in 
this species (J.P. Hazebroek, J.D. Metzger [1990] Plant Physiol 94: 
157-165). In the present report additional biochemical information 
about the nature of this low-temperature-regulated process i s  
provided. l h e  endogenous levels of kaurenoic acid in leaves and 
shoot tips of plants were estimated by combined gas chromatog- 
raphy-chemical ionization mass spectrometry at various times after 
4 weeks of vernalization at 6°C. l h e  endogenous levels in shoot 
tips declined 10-fold by 2 d after the plants were returned to 21'C; 
this decline continued such that there was nearly 50-fold less 
kaurenoic acid by 10 d after the end of vernalization. No effect of 
vernalization on the endogenous levels of kaurenoic acid in leaves 
was observed. An ,in vitro enzyme assay was developed to monitor 
changes in the ability of tissues to convert kaurenoic acid to ent- 
7a-hydroxykaur-16-en-19-oic acid (7-OH kaurenoic acid). l h e  ac- 
tivity of this enzyme rapidly increased in microsomal extracts from 
shoot tips following the end of vernalization. No thermoinduced 
increase in activity was observed in leaves. l h e  enzymic oxidation 
of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenol was also induced in shoot tips by 
vernalization. However, this reaction does not appear to be rate 
limiting for GA biosynthesis, because substantial amounts of kau- 
renoic acid accumulated in noninduced shoot tips. lhese results 
corroborate our hypothesis that the conversion of kaurenoic acid 
to 7-OH kaurenoic acid is the primary step in CA metabolism 
regulated by vernalization in Thlaspi shoot tips. 
Environmental factors such as daylength and temperature 
have an important role in the control of reproductive devel- 
opment in plants. Species requiring a period of low temper- 
ature (O-10°C) or vemalization before the initiation of flow- 
ering form a large and evolutionarily diverse group that 
includes members of the Gramineae, Cruciferae, Compositae, 
Chenopodiaceae, and Solanaceae. The change in develop- 
mental state induced by vemalization is referred to as ther-

moinduction (Lang, 1965; Bemier et al., 1981). Although 
many of the physiological characteristics of thermoinduction 
have been defined, essentially nothing is known about the 
biochemical or molecular processes that occur during vemal- 
ization. This lack of knowledge is probably due to the com- 
plexities of the morphological changes that occur during the 
transition from the vegetative to the flowering state. 
We have focused on the bolting or stem elongation re- 
sponse exhibited by many species induced to flower by 
vernalization or long days. Typically, the vegetative growth 
habit of these plants is to form a rosette with extremely short 
intemodes. Following flower induction, many of the inter- 
nodes begin to expand. This, combined with the growth of 
newly formed intemodes in the inflorescence, causes a rapid 
and dramatic change in the appearance of bolting plants 
(Lang, 1965; Zeevaart, 1983). 
We have been using Thlaspi aruense L. (field pennycress) 
as a model system for our studies of the biochemical mech- 
anisms underlying thermoinduced stem growth. This crucifer 
is native to Eurasia but is now quite prevalent in cultivated 
fields of the Great Plains of North America (Best and Mc- 
Intyre, 1975). Our previous work has shown that bolting in 
Thlaspi is a GA-dependent process (Metzger, 1985). This led 
to the hypothesis that vemalization activates one or more 
steps in GA biosynthesis such that a specific GA accumulates 
above a threshold leve1 and stem growth is initiated (Metzger, 
1985). We obtained evidence for this idea and proposed that 
the rate-limiting step for GA biosynthesis in vegetative 
Thlaspi plants is the hydroxylation of the GA precursor 
kaurenoic acid to 7-OH kaurenoic acid (Fig. 1). Furthermore, 
the thermoinductive activation of this step in GA biosynthesis 
was found to be restricted to the shoot tip, the site of 
perception of vemalizing temperatures (Hazebroek and Metz- 
ger, 1990; Metzger, 1990; Metzger and Hassebrock, 1990). In 
this report, we show that the activity of the enzyme catalyzing 
this step is induced by vemalization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Plant Material and Crowing Conditions 
The CRI inbred line of Thlaspi aruense L. (Metzger, 1985) 
was used in most experiments. The specific details of growing 
conditions and the vemalization treatments were described 
previously (Metzger, 1985). Plants were grown at 21OC for 6 
weeks before a 4-week vemalization treatment (6OC). In each 
experiment, control plants (grown at constant 21OC) were 
about the same chronological age (approximately 11 weeks) 
as vemalized plants. 
Quantitative Analysis of Endogenous Kaurenoids 
The endogenous levels of kaurene and kaurenoic acid in 
leaves and shoot tips were determined by GC-MS-CI. The 
leaves and shoot tips from 10 plants were separated, frozen 
with liquid NZ, and lyophilized. Dried tissue was homoge- 
nized in 125 mL of cold (approximately 4OC) methanol and 
filtered. The residue following filtration was extracted twice 
with cold methanol(l25 mL). To the combined filtrates were 
added 100 ng of ['Hlkaurene and 500 ng of [2H]kaurenoic 
acid as intemal standards. The volume of the filtrates was 
reduced to 90 mL, and 10 mL of H20 was added. Approxi- 
mately 15 g of Preparative Cls bulk packing material3 (Waters, 
Milford MA) were added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 
min at room temperature. The Cls was removed by filtration. 
A second batch of clean Cls (approximately 10 g) was added 
to the filtrate, stirred for 30 min, and removed by filtration. 
The filtrates containing kaurenoic acid were combined and 
dried, and the residue was subjected to adsorption chroma- 
tography on a 2.5- X 6.0-cm column of silica. Kaurenoic acid 
was eluted with 100 mL of ch1oroform:ethyl acetate (50:50). 
After the solvent was removed, the residue was chromato-

graphed on reverse-phase HPLC as previously described 
(Metzger and Hazebroek, 1989). The fraction containing kau- 
renoic acid (27-28 min) was collected, dried, methylated with 
ethereal diazomethane, . and rechromatographed on reverse- 
phase HPLC using a second water-methanol gradient system. 
The initial solvent composition was 80% methanol and 1% 
acetic acid. At the time of injection the percentage of meth- 
ano1 was linearly increased to 100% in 10 min. Flow rate was 
5 mL min-I. The fraction containing methyl-kaurenoate (1 1.2 
min) was dried and redissolved in 10 pL of N-methyl-N- 
trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. 
The two batches of Cls containing kaurene were combined 
and washed with 100 mL of acetone, followed by 100 mL of 
tetrahydrofuran. The washes were combined and dried, and 
the residue was chromatographed on a 1.5- X 15.0-cm col- 
umn of silica; kaurene was eluted with 60 mL of n-hexane. 
The volume of the n-hexane was reduced to a few mL under 
reduced pressure at 35OC; the remaining solvent was evap- 
orated with a stream of NZ at 21OC until incipient dryness. 
The residue was chromatographed on reverse-phase HPLC 
using the same solvent system described for methyl-kauren- 
oate. The fraction containing kaurene (13.8 min) was dried, 
and the residue was redissolved in 10 pL of N-methyl-N- 
trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. 
The purified samples containing kaurene and kaurenoic 
acid were analyzed by GC-MS-CI using a Finnegan-MAT ion 
trap mass spectrometer interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard 
5890 gas chromatograph. Ionization was achieved with a 
stream of protonated molecules of acetonitrile. Gaseous ace- 
tonitrile was introduced directly into the source by the pres- 
sure difference between the source and an extemal glass 
ampule containing a few mL of HPLC grade acetonitrile. The 
source pressure of the ionizing gas was adjusted with a simple 
stainless steel needle valve until a ratio of m/z 42 (MH+) to 
m/z 41 (M+) of 13 was obtained. This ionization technique 
yielded mass spectra dominated by the base peak (usually 
MH+) with little other fragmentation. The net result was a 
10-fold increase in sensitivity and a concomitant reduction 
in the interference from ions originating from other closely 
eluting compounds. Stable source pressures of the ionization 
gas were more easily obtained with this method than with 
more conventional ionization gases (e.g. methane and iso- 
butane) as long as the temperature of the glass ampule 
containing the acetonitrile remained constant. The amount 
of kaurene and kaurenoic acid in each fraction was estimated 
using isotope dilution as previously described (Metzger and 
Hassebrock, 1 9 9 O). 
Other instrumental and chromatographic conditions were 
identical with those described previously (Metzger and 
Hazebroek, 1989). 
The quantitative analyses were repeated once using differ- 
ent tissue samples with similar results. 
Enzymic Oxidation of Kaurene and Kaurenoic Acid 
Microsomal extracts were prepared from shoot tips (1-cm 
apical sections with leaves greater than 1 mm in length 
removed) and from young leaves (4 cm in length). The 
tissue was harvested and placed immediately in a beaker in 
ice, and 5 mL of grinding buffer g-' fresh weight of tissue

was added. The grinding buffer consisted of 100 m~ Tris (pH 
7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 m~ DTT, 5% (w/v) dry polyvi- 
nylpolypyrrolidone, 0.4 m~ PMSF, and 1 pL of a protease 
inhibitor cocktail mL-' of grinding buffer prepared as de- 
scribed by Ronnett et al. (1984). The tissue was homogenized 
with a Polytron tissue homogenizer at full power for 60 s. 
The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheese- 
cloth and centrifuged at 10,OOOg for 10 min. The supematant 
was recentrifuged at 150,OOOg for 90 min to yield a micro- 
soma1 pellet. The microsomes were resuspended in 100 m~ 
Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and the 
protease inhibitors as in the grinding buffer (0.5 mL g-' 
original fresh weight of tissue) and stored in liquid N2. 
The amounts of putative ['4C]kaurenol and putative 
[I4C]7-OH kaurenoic acid produced in enzyme assays were 
used as measures of K-oxidase and KA-hydroxylase activity, 
respectively. Reaction mixtures consisted of 50 to 400 pL of 
microsomal suspension (1.2-9.6 pg of protein pL-'), 45 pmol 
[I4C]kaurene (7.4 MBq pmol-I), or 18 pmol [I4C]kaurenoic 
acid (2.9 MBq pmol-I), 0.5 mM NADPH, 0.5 mM flavin 
adenine dinucleotide, and 100 m~ Tris (pH 7.5) in a total 
volume of 1 mL. Duplicate reactions were run in open 20- 
mL scintillation vials at 30°C in a shaking water bath (150 
cycles min-') for 30 or 60 min. Reactions were stopped by 
adding 1 mL of acetone. The resulting mixtures were ex- 
tracted once with 2 mL of hexane:acetone (3:l) and twice 
with ethyl acetate. The organic fractions were combined, 
dried under a stream of N2, and then dissolved in 200 pL of 
methanol. The products of the reactions were separated by 
Cls reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters 5- X 100-mm (5-pm 
particle size) Nova-Pak Cls Radial-Pak cartridge. Radiola- 
beled products were eluted from the column with a linear 
gradient of 70 to 100% methanol in water (both solvents 
contained 1% acetic acid) in 10 min. Eluting radiolabeled 
compounds were detected using a Beckman 171 radioisotope 
detector. Radioactive products were identified by comparing 
the retention times with those of authentic standards. This 
chromatographic system separated 7-OH kaurenoic acid from 
its Cell, -13, and -15 isomers as well as the 'H-labeled 
hydroxylated kaurenoic acid metabolite detected in an earlier 
feeding study (Hazebroek and Metzger, 1990). 7-OH kauren- 
oic acid was also separated from 7P-hydroxykaurenolide, 
another potential oxidative metabolite of kaurenoic acid, 
by this system. Peaks of radioactivity were collected, and 
the amount of label was determined by liquid scintillation 
spectrometry . 
Insufficient product was formed from each reaction for 
confirmation of identity by GC-MS. The data are presented 
as the percentages of the total recoverable 14C cochromato- 
graphing on Cls reverse-phase HPLC with either kaurenol or 
7-OH kaurenoic acid. 
The only enzymic products observed in the assays of K- 
oxidase and KA-hydroxylase were putative ['4C]kaurenol and 
putative ['4C]kaurenoic acid, respectively. However, small 
amounts of products more polar than the parent compounds 
were detected in a11 assays, including the boiled and "no 
enzyme" controls (included in a11 experiments); these nonen- 
zymically produced products were not included in the cal- 
culations of enzyme activity. 
Protein levels in the microsomal preparations were meas- 
ured using the method of Bradford (1976). 
Labeled Chemicals 
[1,7,12,18-'4C41Kaurene (7.4 MBq pmol-') was biosynthe- 
sized from R-[2-'4C]mevalonic acid lactone (2.0 MBq pmol-I; 
Amersham) using soluble enzymes from pumpkin (Cucurbita 
maxima L.) liquid endosperm following previously described 
procedures (Bimberg et al., 1986; Hazebroek and Metzger, 
1990). [1,7,12,18-'4C4]Kaurenoic acid (2.9 MBq pmol-I) was 
biosynthesized from the I4C4-kaurene using microsomal en- 
zymes from pumpkin endosperm prepared as described for 
Thlaspi. Microsomes were suspended in 400 m~ Tris (pH 7.5) 
containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 m~ PMSF, and 1 r L  mL-' 
of protease inhibitors and stirred for 30 min at 4OC. The 
mixtures were centrifu'ged at 150,OOOg for 90 min, and the 
pellets were resuspended in volumes of 200 p~ Tris (pH 7.5) 
equal to twice the volume with which the microsomal pelletç 
were washed. Each of the 50 reaction mixtures (2 mL each) 
contained 800 pL of the microsomal suspension, 1 nmol 
[I4C]kaurene, 0.5 mM NADPH, 0.05 nM flavin adenine dinu- 
cleotide, and 100 m~ Tris (pH 7.5) to make a total reaction 
volume of 2 mL. The reactions were incubated in open vials 
in a shaking water bath at 3OoC and stopped after 30 min by 
the addition of 1 mL of acetone. The mixtures were combined 
and extracted once with an equal volume of hexane:acetone 
(3:l) and twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The 
organic fractions were combined and the ['4C]kaurenoic acid 
purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously. 
Specific activities of the I4C-labeled kaurene and kaurenoic 
acid were determined by GC-MS (Bowen et al., 1972). 
['HIKaurene and ['Hlkaurenoic acid used as intemal stand- 
ards in quantitative analysis were synthesized from the C-16 
norketone via the Wittig reaction (Metzger and Hassebrock, 
1990). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Previous work showed that exogenous [2H]kaurenoic acid 
was metabolized approximately 19 times more rapidly in 
thermoinduced shoot tips than nonvemalized ones (Haze- 
broek and Metzger, 1990). This observation was paralleled 
by the rapid decline of endogenous kaurenoic acid levels in 
shoot tips following the retum of plants to 21OC after 4 
weeks of vemalization (Table I). Endogenous kaurenoic acid 
levels decreased by about 10-fold 2 d after the end of the 
cold treatment. After 10 d, there was nearly 60-fold less 
kaurenoic acid than at the end of the cold treatment and 49- 
fold less than in noninduced shoot tips (Table I). This latter 
figure is comparable to the 47-fold difference found earlier 
when relative kaurenoic acid levels were compared in shoot 
tips from plants harvested 10 d after the end of a 4-week 
cold treatment and those maintained at 21OC (Hazebroek 
and Metzger, 1990). In contrast, vemalization did not affect 
endogenous kaurenoic acid levels in leaves (Table I). This is 
consistent with previous work showing that both the site of 
perception of vemalizing temperatures and the thermoinduc- 
tive regulation of kaurenoic acid metabolism to GAs are 
restricted to the shoot tip (Metzger, 1988; Hazebroek and 
Metzger, 1990).

Although endogenous kaurene levels were substantially 
higher in noninduced shoot tips, vemalization did not result 
in a progressive decline in kaurene levels after the plants 
were retumed to 21OC as was observed for kaurenoic acid 
(Table I). Nevertheless, the accumulation of kaurene in non- 
induced shoot tips is an indication that vemalization does, in 
fact, induce an increased rate of kaurene metabolism after 
plants are retumed to warm temperatures. However, vemal- 
ization had no effect on kaurene levels in the leaves (Table 
I), showing that low temperature alters kaurene metabolism 
in a tissue-specific manner similar to that of kaurenoic acid. 
The cellular basis for thermoinduced stem growth in 
Thlaspi is an increase in the number of cells in the pith and 
cortex resulting from a burst of cell division that begins about 
4 d after the end of a 4-week vemalization treatment (Metzger 
and Dusbabek, 1991). Thus, the initial changes in both kau- 
rene and kaurenoic acid levels occur before the cellular events 
induced by vernalization. 
Neither 7-OH kaurenoic acid and GA,,-aldehyde, the two 
intermediates in the pathway leading from kaurenoic acid to 
GAs, nor kaurenol and kaurenal, the two intermediates in 
the metabolism of kaurene to kaurenoic acid (Fig. l), were 
detected in any extracts. These compounds were also not 
observed in much larger samples of Thlaspi tissue (Metzger 
and Hazebroek, 1989), indicating that the tumover of these 
four intermediates in GA biosynthesis is rapid. On the other 
hand, the accumulation of kaurene and kaurenoic acid to 
high levels in noninduced plants demonstrates that the tum- 
over of these two compounds is much slower. Because the 
overall flux through a metabolic pathway is determined by 
the rate of its slowest component reaction, the hydroxylation 
of kaurene to kaurenol and kaurenoic acid to 7-OH kaurenoic 
acid may represent controlling steps in low-temperature- 
regulated GA biosynthesis in Thlaspi. 
Rate-limiting reactions in metabolic pathways are often 
catalyzed by regulatory enzymes. That vernalization rapidly 
induces Iarge changes in the levels of both kaurene and 
kaurenoic acid suggests that the enzymes responsible for 
their hydroxylation are regulated by temperature. To inves- 
tigate this further, an in vitro assay system was developed to 
monitor changes in the capacity of Thlaspi tissues to convert 
kaurene to kaurenol (K-oxidase) and kaurenoic acid to 7-OH 
kaurenoic acid (KA-hydroxylase) as a function of develop- 
mental state. 
Both enzymes were associated exclusively with the 
150,OOOg (microsomal) pellet (data not shown). Activity was 
dependent on the presence of 0 2  and NADPH, which is 
consistent with observations by other workers that these two 
enzymes are Cyt P450-linked mixed-function oxidases (Mur- 
phy and West, 1969; Jennings and Coolbaugh, 1993). 
Figure 2 shows the effects of vernalization on the activities 
of K-oxidase (Fig. 2A) and KA-hydroxylase (Fig. 28) in shoot 
tips. The activities of both enzymes were enhanced following 
vemalization. Maximum activity of K-oxidase was achieved 
with the lowest amount of protein used in the assay, sug-

gesting that substrate and/or cofactor còncentration was lim- 
iting. Small amounts of K-oxidase activity were also detected 
in shoot tips of noninduced plants (Fig. 2A). 
Very little KA-hydroxylase activity was detected at any 
protein concentration from noninduced shoot tips. Micro- 
somes prepared from shoot tips harvested either 5 or 14 d 
after the end of vemalization displayed increased KA-hy- 
droxylase activity (Fig. 2B). The thermoinduced level of en- 
zyme activity was nearly the same in shoot tips harvested 5 
or 14 d after the end of vemalization. Apparently, the cold- 
induced increase in KA-hydroxylase activity is a stable bio- 
chemical change associated with the thermoinduced state. 
We previously proposed that the hydroxylation of kauren- 
oic acid to 7-OH kaurenoic acid is the primary low-temper- 
ature-regulated step in GA biosynthesis in Thlaspi 
(Hazebroek and Metzger, 1990; Metzger, 1990). Although 
K-oxidase is also induced by vemalization (Table I, Fig. 2A), 
significant in vivo oxidation of kaurene does occur in the 
shoot tips of noninduced plants, because kaurenoic acid, 
which is a product of kaurene oxidation (Fig. l), accumulates 
to very high levels (Table I). This observation is consistent 
with the conversion of kaurenoic acid to 7-OH kaurenoic 
acid being the rate-limiting step in early GA biosynthesis. 
The thermoinduced increase in kaurene oxidation is, how- 
ever, necessary for continued GA biosynthesis in shoot tips 
following vemalization, because endogenous kaurenoic acid 
levels rapidly decline (Table I) as tumover increases (Haze- 
broek and Metzger, 1990). If the increase in kaurene oxidation 
did not occur, the supply of kaurenoic acid would rapidly 
deplete and GA biosynthesis would cease. Indeed, applica- 
tion of inhibitors of kaurene synthesis to thermoinduced 
Thlaspi plants results in a rapid decline in stem growth 
(Metzger, 1985). 
The kinetics of the increase in KA-hydroxylase activity in 
shoot tips following vemalization was examined. As shown 
in Table 11, enzyme activity was rapidly induced. There was 
nearly 4 times more extractable KA-hydroxyIase activity than 
in the noninduced controls 12 h after the plants were retumed 
to 21OC; by 4 d the level of activity was comparable to the 
values observed previously in shoot tips harvested either 5 
or 14 d after the end of vemalization (Fig. 28). Thus, the 
timing of the increase in KA-hydroxylase activity was closely 
correlated with the decline in endogenous kaurenoic acid 
levels in shoot tips following vernalization (Table I), suggest- 
ing a causal relationship. 
There was nearly 2-fold more KA-hydroxylase activity in 
shoot tips harvested immediately at the end of the cold 
treatment (O d) than from the noninduced controls (Table 11). 
This indicates that the molecular processes that induce the 
increase in KA-hydroxylase activity in response to vemali- 
zation begin to act during the cold treatment. 
To test whether the lower KA-hydroxylase activity associ- 
ated with microsomes isolated from noninduced shoot tips is 
caused by an endogenous inhibitor that is present in higher 
amounts than in microsomes from thermoinduced material, 
the effect of adding microsomal extracts derived from non- 
induced shoot tips on KA-hydroxylase was examined. Micro- 
somes were isolated from noninduced shoot tips and from 
shoot tips harvested 5 d after the end of vemalization, mixed 
in different proportions, and assayed for KA-hydroxylase 
activity. The addition of microsomes from noninduced shoot 
tips had no effect on KA-hydroxylase activity present in 
microsomes from vemalized shoot tips (Table 111). The ther- 
moinductive regulation of KA-hydroxylase activity is, there- 
fore, probably not mediated by an endogenous inhibitor. 
The observation that extractable KA-hydroxylase activity 
was about the same in vernalized shoot tips harvested 5 or 
14 d after the end of the cold treatment (Fig. 2B) suggests 
that the increase in enzyme activity following vemalization 
is independent of endogenous substrate concentrations. This 
conclusion was strengthened by examining the effects of 
reduced endogenous kaurenoic acid levels on the thermoin- 
duced increase in KA-hydroxylase activity. Plants of the 
EMS-141 mutant of Thlaspi are GA deficient because of a 
block in GA biosynthesis at the formation of kaurene; mutant 
plants contain no detectable GAs and approximately 40 times 
less endogenous kaurenoic acid than wild-type (CRI) plants 
(Metzger and Hassebrock, 1990). Although the mutant con- 
tains considerably less endogenous substrate than the wild 
type, the same level of KA-hydroxylase activity was induced 
by vemalization (data not shown). As was also observed for 
CRI plants, the level of enzyme activity was about the same 
Table 111. Effect of the addition of microsomes from noninduced 
shoot tips on KA-hydroxylase activity in microsomal preparations 
from vernalized Thlaspi shoot tips 
Microsomes were prepared from the shoot tips of 1 I-week-old 
nonvernalized plants and from plants harvested 5 d after the end 
of a 4-week vernalization treatment. Various amounts of micro- 
somes from the  noninduced plants were mixed with a constant 
amount  of microsomes (0.38 mg of protein) from vernalized plants, 
and KA-hydroxylase activity was determined. The values represent 
the mean and SE of two redicate assays.

in microsomal preparations from shoot tips harvested 5 or 14 
d after the end of the cold treatment. Thus, vemalization 
appears to act directly in the induction of KA-hydroxylase 
activity. 
Application of GA3 to noninduced Thlaspi plants evokes a 
flowering response, including bolting, identical with that 
obtained with vemalization (Metzger, 1985). Therefore, the 
effect of exogenous GA3 on KA-hydroxylase activity in non- 
induced shoot tips was examined. Thlaspi plants were grown 
at 21OC for 5 weeks. A solution (10 p L )  containing 10% 
(v/v) acetone, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, and 1 pg pL-' of GA3 
was applied to the shoot tips three times a week. Shoot tips 
were harvested 4 and 14 d after the first application, and 
KA-hydroxylase activity was assessed. Exogenous GA, did 
not result in an increase in KA-hydroxylase activity at either 
harvest time (data not shown). This provides a biochemical 
explanation for the requirement of continuous GA applica- 
tions for stem growth and other aspects of reproductive 
development to proceed to completion in noninduced plants 
(Metzger, 1985). Application of GA3 to noninduced plants 
causes increased cell division in the subapical meristem 4 d 
after the first application, followed by measurable intemode 
elongation and the formation of flower primordia by 7 and 
10 d, respectively. However, exogenous GA does not lead to 
a stable change of developmental state analogous to the 
thermoinduced state, because stopping the GA applications 
results in the cessation of stem growth, abortion of the flower 
primordia, and the formation of aerial rosettes (Metzger, 
1985; Metzger and Dusbabek, 1991). 
The site of perception of vemalizing temperatures in 
Thlaspi appears to be the shoot tip (Metzger, 1988). Other 
results indicate that the low-temperature regulation of kau- 
renoic acid metabolism is specifically located in that tissue as 
well (Table I; Hazebroek and Metzger, 1990). Likewise, the 
increase in KA-hydroxylase activity following vemalization 
occurs only in the shoot tip. No differences in enzyme activity 
were observed in microsomal preparations derived from 
leaves of vemalized (4.3 f 1.0%) or noninduced (3.6 2 0.2%) 
plants. One explanation for this observation is the existence 
of more than one gene coding for KA-hydroxylase, the 
expression of each being tissue specific. Indeed, the isolation 
of single-gene mutants in pea that are blocked in steps of GA 
biosynthesis in some tissues but not others (Reid et al., 1983) 
supports this idea. 
Environmental factors have been inferred to regulate GA 
metabolism (Graebe, 1987). However, this is only the second 
report of an environmental stimulus resulting in changes in 
the activities of specific enzymes. In spinach, the conversion 
of GAS3 to G&, and GAI9 to GA20 are both under photoper- 
iodic regulation, and the activities of the enzymes responsible 
for these reactions increase in plants under light and decrease 
when plants are retumed to darkness (Gilmour et al., 1986). 
However, there appears to be a fundamental difference in 
the regulation of the spinach enzymes by light and the 
thermoinductive regulation of both K-oxidase and KA-hy- 
droxylase activity in Thlaspi shoot tips, because maximum 
activity of the two Thlaspi enzymes is attained only after the 
cold treatment ends. Although the molecular basis for the 
cold-induction of K-oxidase and KA-hydroxylase in Thlaspi 
is unknown, the observation that maximum activity is main- 
tained for at least 2 weeks after the termination of the 
inductive stimulus suggests that vemalization results in the 
transcriptional activation of previously silent genes. Ob- 
viously, a definitive answer to this question must await the 
molecular cloning of the genes encoding these two enzymes.
