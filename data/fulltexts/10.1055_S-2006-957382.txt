The chromatographlc method has been validated and applied for quantltatlve detenninatfon of harpagoside. The results show the hlghest levels of harpagoside in the leaf extract. The purity and ldentfty of peaks were controlled by diode-array detectfon and comparison with standards. The genus Scrophularia is known for the presence of variety of iridoid glycosides (1, 2). Plants belonging to this genus are well-known drugs in folk medicine (Scrophularia nodosa L. Scrophularia canina L. Scrophularia ningponsis L). lt was suggested that the therapeutical action depends upon the presence of iridoids. Scrophularia scorodonia L is distributed in the south-west of Spain and in the north-west of Africa. Recently the main iridoids of S.scorodonia were isolated and identified (3, 4). One of these compounds, harpagoside, is the main iridoid of secondary roots Harpagophytum procumbens o.e. (Pedalia­ceae ), a drug used for its anti-inflammatory activity (5). The aim of the present work was the application of the HPLC system for harpagoside detennination. due to the medicinal values of this compound present in sorne medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory activity such as S. ningpoensis (6). For this reason it is of interest to compare the concentration of harpagoside in S. scorodonia with another species from the genus Scrophularia and with H. procumbens, with the aim to establish a possible new source of harpagoside. Sorne methods conceming the study of harpagoside in Harpagophytum by HPLC have been reported (7-9). These methods are not suitable for the analysis of S. scorodonia compounds, because the extracts from this drug and others species of the genus are more complex than H. procumbens extracts, and the separation between the peaks was not satisfactory. Thus, we have modified the method proposed by Sticher and Meier (9) to obtain a complete separation of the major compounds (harpagoside, verbascoside, scorodioside) from S. scorodonia and quantitative detenninadon of harpago­side in this species using a gradient procedure. The identifica­don by HPLC. together with harpagoside, of scorodioside, a new iridoid recently isolated in S.scorodonia (4) and verbas­coside in different plant extracts is reported using photodiode array detection. These compounds are present in diff'erent quantity in leaf, stem, and flower extracts from this species. The HPLC profiles of diff'erent methanolic extracts of S.scoro­donia (Fig. t) showed good resoludon of the main consdt­uents. Harpagoside, scorodioside, and verbascoside are the major components of this species. Scorodioside content varíes with plant part. The amount of this compound in stems and leaves is high; and it is highest in stems, while this compound does not appear in flowers. Verbascoside was present in ali extracts from S. scorodonia. With the optimized mobile phase stem, leaf, and flower extracts of S. scorodonia were analyzed. The diode array detector generated W spectra of the peales corresponding to the three main compounds in the plant extracts and these showed that each peak corresponded to pure standard with no co-eluting impurities. The HPLC analysis is simple and can líe easily automated. The quantitative determinadon was carried out using an externa! standard f or calibration. The linearity of the HPLC method was observed in the range of 0.05-0.4mg/ml. Data for least-squares regression analysis of the calibrtion graph were y • 940591-99 + 3851761 x (r - 0.99519, where y • peak area. x • concentration in mg/ml and r • correlation coefficient At a 2: 1 signal-to-noise ratio the detection of harpagoside was 0.5 µg/mL The reproductibility of the method was calculated by assaying ten replicates of the same 80 % methanol extraer; stem extracts were injected directly, leaf and flower extracts were dlluted to 1/10 and 1/2, respectively. Toe relative standard deviation for stem extracts was estimated to be 133 %. The reproductibility of harpago­side standard preparation was tested by assaying ten prepara­dons at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The relative standard deviation was estimated to be 0.80 %. Four stem extractions with 80 % MeOH were tested for the reproductibility of the extraction method. The relative standard deviation was 4.64 %. Quantification limit was 25 µg/ml for harpagoside, for ten injections, coefficient of variation was 3.18 %. Concentrations of samples were determined directly from the calibradon graphs. Quantitative analysis of 80 % MeOH ex­tracts showed that the amount of harpagoside is 036 % in flowers, 0.25 % in stems, and 1.76 % in leaves. The samples showed great diff'erence in their composition. The elaborated HPLC method is well adapted not only f or the idendfication of harpagoside, scorodioside, and verbascoside. but also for the quantitadve determinadon of harpagoside. Toe present method allows a highly selective and reliable detection of the three compounds in S. scomdonia extracts. lt is applicable for the analytical control of harpagoside for sdendfic and industrial purposes. In S.scorodonia, the highest concentra­tion of harpagoside has been found in leaves extracts. This result is very interesdng because the content of harpagoside in S. scomdonia leaves is similar to that of H. procumbens (5). So, S. scorodonia is a potential new source of harpagoside. 0.4 0.2 0.10 0,40 0,3D 0.20 0,10 Flg. 1 Chromatogram of a leaves extract from Scrophu/aria scorodonia. 0.00-....__,._-� ---------f-0,00 Minute• Materials and Methods Authentic samples of harpagoside, scorodioside, and verba�­coside were isolated from S. scorodonia in our laboratory m earlier studies (3, 4). HPLC grade methanol was obtained from Cario Erba (Milano, Italy). Purified and deionised water and solvents were filtered on 0.2µm Dynagard (USA) filter for each HPLC application. Stems, leaves and flowers from S.scorodonia were collected in May 1995, atjaén (Spain). Taxonomic identification was verified by Pr. C. Bartolomé Esteban (Department of Vegetal Physiology, Faculty of Sciences Alcalá de Henares, Madrid (Spain); voucher specimen are deposited (LMF 95) at the Faculty of Pharmacy Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain. The dried samples were pulverized in a kitchen-type blender prior to analysis. The high-performance liquid chromatograph consisted of an automatic sample injector (Waters WISP 712), two solvent­delivery systems (Waters M 510) and a photodiode array detector (Waters 996), connected to a Millenium 2010 system. A prepacked analytical column (300 x 3.9 mm) Phenomenex Bondclone Interchim (Montlm;on France) C18 (l0µm) was used with a µ-Bondapak C18 guard column (Waters). The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol/water: the gradient profile for optimal separation is showed in Table 1. The flow rate used was 1.5 ml/min. Throughout the experiment, ali injection volumes were 20 µl. The lN was set at 278 nm. The system was operated at room temperature (20 ·q. Tablel Gradient table.

Aliquots of 20 µI of these solutions were subjected to HPLC analysis: stem extract was injected directly, leaf and flower extracts were diluted to 1/10 and 1/2, respec­tively. Dried material (1 g) of H.procumbens was extracted according to the French Pharmacopeia (tenth editioni The extract was injected directly into the HPLC. Solutions of harpagoside, scorodioside, and verbascoside were prepared at 1 mg/ml in HPLC grade methanol. Ali samples were filtered through a 0.45 micron filter prior to use in HPLC analyses.
