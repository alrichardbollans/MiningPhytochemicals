Introduction
The rhizomes of Cimicifuga species (Ranunculaceae) are used
as Traditional Chinese Medicines. Among Cimicifuga species,
C. heracleifolia, C. dahurica and  C. foetida are listed in the
Chinese Pharmacopoeia and used as an anti-inflammatory,
antipyretic and analgesic remedy (1). Cimicifuga racemosa,
commonly known as black cohosh, is a herb used among Native
Americans to treat a variety of ailments, including diarrhea, sore
throat and rheumatism. It is best known for its health benefit in
treating menopausal disorders (2). It is used therapeutically to
reduce the frequency and intensity of hot flushes (3), and in the
USA the extract of C. racemosa is available for sale as a dietary
supplement used for the treatment of menopausal and post-
menopausal symptoms (4). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes
belong to heme-containing monooxygenases and constitute three
families, CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 (5), and these enzymes are rec-
ognized to be responsible for drug metabolism, carcinogenesis
and degradation of xenobiotics. Among a family of CYP
enzymes, CYP3A4 is the most abundant enzyme in human liver
microsomes and intestinal epithelium; ~30% of the total CYP
was suggested to be CYP3A4 (6), and  50% of clinically used
drugs are oxidized by CYP3A4 (7,8). It is widely known that
concomitant oral administration of several foods and herbs
affects drug metabolism in humans by inhibiting CYP3A4 activ-
ity. Among them, the inhibition by grapefruit juice has been well
studied and it is reported that concomitant intake of the juice
alters the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, including
cyclosporin (9,10), midazolam (11), dihydropyridine-type cal-
cium channel blockers (12) and triazolam (13). In the course of
our study on CYP inhibitors from foods, we have reported
the isolation and structural elucidation of CYP inhibitors from
grapefruit (Citrus paradisii) juice (14–16), white pepper, Piper
nigrum (17,18) and the strawberry fruit, Fragaria ananassa (19).
Recently, we found that the commercially available black
cohosh, C. racemosa Nutt, showed CYP3A4 inhibition. Here we
report the isolation, structural identification and CYP inhibitory
activity of constituents from black cohosh.

Recent investigation on drug interaction has shown that some foods and herbal medicines increase the
oral availability of a variety of CYP3A4 substrates, which is caused by the reduction of CYP3A4 in
intestinal epithelium. During the course of our investigation on CYP3A4 interaction, we found that the
commercially available dietary supplement made from black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) showed
CYP3A4 inhibition. Black cohosh has been used for the treatment of menopausal and post-menopausal
symptoms as a dietary supplement. Bioassay-guided isolation from the supplement afforded six active
principles, which were identified as cycloartanoid triterpene glycosides.

Isolation of Triterpene Glycosides 1–6 from 
C. racemosa
Commercially available black cohosh, C. racemosa Nutt, was
generously provided by from Tokiwa Phytochemical Co., Ltd.
(Japan). The powder of black cohosh (20 g) was suspended in
water and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic
layer was then partitioned between hexane and 90% methanol
(MeOH)-H2O. The polar fraction (6.1 g), which exhibited
significant CYP3A4 inhibition, 44% at 5 mg/ml, was subjected
to silica gel chromatography with EtOAc/MeOH followed by
octadecyl silica gel (ODS) chromatography with MeOH/H2O
and then acetonitrile (CH3CN)/H2O to afford a potent CYP3A4
inhibitory fraction. The purification by ODS high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with CH3CN/H2O gave six triter-
pene glycosides 1–6. On the basis of 1H NMR spectra in C5D5N
and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS), the
six triterpene glycosides were identified as cimiracemoside H (1,
2.0 mg, 0.01% yield) (19), 26-deoxyactein (2, 1.1 mg, 0.0055%)
(20,21), 23-O-acetylshengmanol 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside (3, 1.9
mg, 0.0095%) (22), actaeaepoxide 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside (4,
1.1 mg, 0.0055%) (23), 25-O-acetylcimigenol 3-O- -L-ara-
binopyranoside (5, 5.9 mg, 0.029%) (24) and 25-O-acetyl-
cimigenol 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside (6, 4.2 mg, 0.021%) (25,26)
(Figure 1).
Assay of CYP3A4 Inhibition
CYP3A4 activity was based on nifedipine oxidation. Various
amounts (0–10  M, final concentration) of samples in 1  l of
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were added to 192  l of solution
containing 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50  M
nifedipine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan),
5 mM glucose-6-phosphate (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan), 0.5 mM  -NADP  (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd), 0.5 mM
MgCl2 and 4.3  g/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd) and incubated at 37 C for 5 min.
CYP3A4 (Gentest Co., Woburn, MA) was also pre-incubated in
7  l of the buffer at 37 C for 5 min and added to the sample
solution. After the incubation at 37 C for 1 h, the reaction was
quenched by the addition of 100  l of MeOH. After adding 3.7  g
of 6-methoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-7-(2-nitrophenyl)-4,7-dihydro-
furo[3,4-b]pyridin-1-(3H)-one in 1  l of DMSO as an internal
standard, the reaction mixture was extracted with 1 ml of ether,
and the ether layer was evaporated. The residue was dissolved
in 100  l of MeOH, and an aliquot (20  l) was analyzed by
reverse-phase HPLC (column,TSK-gel ODS-120T, 4.6 mm i.d.  
150 mm; mobile phase, 64% MeOH-H2O; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min;
detection, UV 254 nm); retention times: 2.9 min for the internal
standard, 4.0 min for the nifedipine metabolite (nifedipine
pyridine) and 5.5 min for nifedipine. The IC50 value, the
concentration required for 50% inhibition of CYP3A4 activity,
was calculated from the data of duplicate measurements.
Results
Bioassay-guided Isolation of Triterpene Glycosides 1–6
from C. racemosa
The CYP inhibition was tested using human CYP3A4 as shown
in Methods. Commercially available supplement of C. racemosa
was extracted with EtOAc, and the organic layer was then
partitioned between hexane and 90% MeOH-H2O. The polar
fraction exhibited significant CYP inhibition. Forty-four percent
inhibition at 5 mg/ml was as potent as that by ketoconazole, 58%
at 5  g/ml. Bioassay-guided fractionation afforded six triterpene
glycosides 1–6. On the basis of their 1H NMR spectra in C5D5N
and FABMS, they were identified as cimiracemoside H
(1, 0.01% yield) (20), 26-deoxyactein (2, 0.0055%) (21,22),

23-O-acetylshengmanol 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside (3, 0.095%)
(23), actaeaepoxide 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside (4, 0.0055%) (24),
25-O-acetylcimigenol 3-O- -L-arabinopyranoside (5, 0.0029%)
(25) and 25-O-acetylcimigenol 3-O- -D-xylopyranoside 
(6, 0.0021%) (26,27). The CYP inhibitory activities of 1–6 are
shown in Table 1, which indicates moderate IC50 values.
Discussion
Bailey et al. demonstrated that the blood concentration of anti-
hypertensive drugs such as nifedipine was kept at a high level
with grapefruit juice co-administered to mask the taste of
alcohol. Since that time there has been a great deal of interest
in food–drug interactions because of the clinical risks associ-
ated with changes in the bioavailability or metabolic rate of
clinically administered drugs. In spite of the increasing use of
herbal remedies and nutraceuticals, information on the drug
interaction that occurs with them including foodstuffs, is still
insufficient to understand the clinical risks.
We have studied drug interactions with foodstuffs such as
grapefruit juice and pepper, isolating several potent CYP3A4
inhibitors in each material. The fact that a foodstuff contains
more than one inhibitor suggests that the clinical effect of drug
interaction with herbs and foodstuffs could be better understood
by studying the mixture of inhibitors and/or an extract of these.
During our study on CYP3A4 inhibitors contained in food,
we found that the supplement of C. racemosa exhibited potent
inhibition. The polar fraction from the extract showed 44%
inhibition at 5 mg/ml, which was as potent as the inhibition
produced by ketoconazole, 58% at 5  g/ml. We clarified the
main constituents, cognate triterpene glycosides, as the
CYP3A4 inhibitory principles. To date, highly potent CYP3A4
inhibitors in food have been reported, e.g. paradisins A and B
(IC50, 0.07 and 0.07  M) from grapefruit juice (15), dip-
iperamide A (IC50, 0.18   M) from white pepper (17) and
gomisin C (IC50, 0.254   M) from Schisandra fruit (29).
Although the IC50 value of each isolate was moderate, the high
content of a series of cognates in the supplement could result
in the exhibition of significant CYP inhibition. Care should be
taken to avoid concomitant intake of black cohosh with any
kind of medication because of the possibility of increasing the
bioavailable concentration of drugs in the blood by the down-
regulation suppression of CYP3A4. Medical practitioners
therefore should pay more attention in order to avoid any trou-
ble with diet containing black cohosh.
The IC50, 0.027 mg/ml, of the extract of black cohosh was
very low in spite of the weak activities of the isolated
compounds. The IC50 value indicates that 40 mg of the black
cohosh extract could be estimated to inhibit the metabolism of
roughly half a dose of nifedipine for 1 day.
Evaluation of the IC50 of both constituents and the extract
may be useful for clinical study of drug interactions of herbs
and foodstuffs predicted to be a clinical risk, especially for the
study of the mechanism of action and the pharmacokinetics.
