In an in vitro study, wemeasured the inhibitory activity of AP on lipase and glucosidase. Inaddition, we evaluated the eﬀects of AP on absorption of orally administered olive oil, glucose, maltose, sucrose and starch solutioninmice.We found that AP concentration-dependently inhibited the activity of lipase, maltase and sucrase with an IC50 of 0.95, 0.22and 0.60mgml−1, respectively. In ICRmice, olive oil was administered orally immediately after oral administration of AP solution,and plasma triglyceride concentration was measured. We found that AP significantly inhibited the rise in plasma triglycerideconcentration after olive oil loading. AP also significantly inhibited the rise in plasma glucose concentration after maltose andsucrose loading, and this eﬀect was more potent against maltose. AP also inhibited the rise in plasma glucose concentration afterglucose loading and slightly inhibited it after starch loading. Our results suggest that AP inhibits lipase and glucosidase activities,which leads to a reduction in the intestinal absorption of lipids and carbohydrates.1. IntroductionAcacia is an evergreen tree belonging to the genus Acaciain the legume family that is widely found throughout theAustralian and African continents. The extract of Acaciacatechu duramen is called gambir and has long been usedas an astringent and antibacterial to treat stomatitis anddiarrhea in Japan and China. Studies have also reportedthat the powdered seeds of A. catechu and A. melanoxylonexhibit hypoglycemic actions by increasing insulin secretionin nondiabetic rats and rabbits [1, 2]. In Europe, acaciapolyphenol (AP) extracted from the bark of the black wattletree (A. mearnsii) has been used to eliminate wine sediment.Australian aborigines also eat the young leaves and beans ofA. mollissima.We previously conducted a study using KKAy mice, amodel for obesity and type 2 diabetes, to evaluate the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic eﬀects of AP [3]. We found thatAP significantly inhibited body weight gain and improveddiabetes and insulin resistance. The anti-obesity actions ofAP appear to be attributable to increased expression ofenergy expenditure-related genes in skeletal muscle and liverand to decreased fatty acid synthesis and fat intake in theliver. AP also reduces hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemiaby increasing adiponectin secretion and suppressing tumornecrosis factor-alpha secretion by white adipocytes, andelevating the expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, inaddition to reducing obesity.AP contains about 80% polyphenols with a molec-ular weight (MW) of 300–3000 kDa [4, 5]. In general,polyphenol constituents with a low MW can easily beabsorbed, compared to higher MW constituents. Low-MWAP constituents are thought to be absorbed in the intestine,thereby altering gene expression in KKAy mice while high-MW AP constituents, which are not thought to be absorbedinto the body, most likely exhibit inhibitory eﬀects againstobesity and diabetes in the gastrointestinal tract. To date,various natural products containing polyphenols have beenreported to have anti-obesity and anti-diabetic eﬀects byinhibiting lipase activity and α-glucosidase activity [6–8].Therefore, to elucidate the action of AP in the intestine,we conducted in vitro lipase activity inhibition and α-glucosidase activity inhibition tests. We also performed invivo lipid tolerance and carbohydrate tolerance tests in orderto evaluate the eﬀects of AP on lipid and carbohydrateabsorption.2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine2. Methods2.1. Hot Water Extract of Acacia Bark. AP was donatedby Mimozax Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan) and preparedaccording to themethods reported by Cutting [9]. Briefly, thepowdered bark of South African A. mearnsii was pulverizedand extracted for 30min in a 10-fold volume of hot water(100◦C), and then dried using a spray drier. The polyphenolcontent of the product, as determined by the Stiasny reaction[10–12], was 83.3%. The number-average MW (Mn) andweight-average MW (Mw) of AP were 812 and 1280,respectively, and robinetinidol and fisetinidol were the majorconstituents.2.2. Materials. Orlistat, pancreatic lipase from porcine pan-creas, maltose, sucrose, glucose, starch, maleic acid andrat intestinal acetone powder were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Triolein, lecithin, tauro-cholic acid, bathocuproine, 3-(2)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisoland acarbose were purchased from Wako Pure ChemicalIndustries (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were commer-cially available products of the highest available grade.2.3. Animals. Male ICR mice (4 weeks old) were purchasedfrom Sankyo Labo Service Corp., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Eachmouse was kept at room temperature (22 ± 1◦C) and 55± 10% humidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle (artificialillumination: 08:00–20:00 h) and acclimatized for 1 weekbefore experiments. The present study was conducted inaccordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Useof Laboratory Animals, as adopted by the Committee onAnimal Research of Hoshi University.2.4. Assay of Pancreatic Lipase Activity In Vitro. Lipaseactivity was determined by measuring the rate of releaseof oleic acid from triolein [13]. A suspension of 90 μmoltriolein, 12.6 μmol lecithin and 9.45 μmol taurocholic acidin 9ml of 0.1M Tris buﬀer (pH 7.0) was sonicated for10min for substrate dissolution. AP (final concentration: 0,0.02, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0mgml−1) and orlistat (finalconcentration: 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 or 200 μgml−1), whichwas used as a positive control, were diluted with 0.1M Trisbuﬀer (pH 7.0). Next, 50 μl of pancreatic lipase (2mgml−1 inTris buﬀer), 100 μl of substrate solution and 100 μl of samplesolution were mixed and incubation was carried out at 37◦Cfor 30min. The mixture was mixed with 1ml of chloroform-n-heptane (1 : 1) containing 2% methanol and extracted byshaking for 5min. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for5min, and the upper aqueous phase was removed by suction.Copper reagent (700 μl) was then added to the lower organicphase. The tube was then shaken for 5min and the mixturewas centrifuged at 1000 g for 5min, after which 0.5ml ofthe upper organic phase (which contained the copper saltsof the extracted fatty acid) was treated with 0.5ml of 0.1%bathocuproine in chloroform containing 0.05% 3-(2)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisol, and its absorbance was measured at490 nm using a U-2800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi HighTechnologies, Tokyo, Japan).2.5. Assay of α-Glucosidase Activity In Vitro. α-Glucosidaseactivity was calculated by measuring the amount of glucosehydrolyzed from maltose or sucrose [14, 15]. Enzymesolutions were prepared using rat intestinal acetone powderas a source of α-glucosidase. One gram of rat intestinalacetone powder was homogenized with 9ml of 0.1Mmaleatebuﬀer (pH 6.9), followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for10min at 4◦C. The supernatant was diluted with 0.1Mmaleate buﬀer by 20 times or two times, and was used asthe enzyme solution for the maltase or sucrase reactions,respectively. AP (final concentration: 0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,1.0 or 2.0mgml−1) and acarbose (final concentration: 0,0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 μgml−1), which was used as a positivecontrol, were diluted with 0.1M maleate buﬀer. Next, 200 μlof sample solution and 200 μl of maltose substrate solution(2% w/v in maleate buﬀer) or sucrose substrate solution(2% w/v in maleate buﬀer) was mixed, and pre-incubatedat 37◦C for 5min. The enzyme reaction was initiated byadding 200 μl of the enzyme solution. The enzyme reactionwas allowed to proceed at 37◦C for 60min, and was thenstopped by heating at 100◦C for 10min. The reactionmixturewas kept on ice, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 gfor 10min. Glucose in the supernatant was measured usinga commercial assay kit (Glucose CII-Test Wako, Wako PureChemical Industries).2.6. Oral Olive Oil Tolerance Test in Mice. For the lipidabsorption test, mice were deprived of food for 18 h beforethe experiment. An AP solution was orally administered at0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 g kg−1 body weight. Olive oil or distilledwater was subsequently administered orally at 5ml kg−1body weight. Before and at 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 h after thisadministration, 60-μl blood samples were taken from theeyeground. All samples were collected with a heparin-coatedcapillary tube and centrifuged (1000 g for 5min) to separatethe plasma. Plasma samples were frozen at –80◦C until assay.Plasma triglyceride concentrations were measured with aTriglyceride E-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries).2.7. Oral Carbohydrate Tolerance Test in Mice. For carbo-hydrate absorption tests, mice were deprived of food for18 h before the experiment. An AP solution was orallyadministered at 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 g kg−1 body weight. Glucose(2 g kg−1), maltose (2 g kg−1), sucrose (4 g kg−1) or starch(4 g kg−1) solution, or distilled water, was subsequentlyadministered orally. Before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hafter administration, 60-μl blood samples were taken fromthe eyeground. All samples were collected in heparin-coatedcapillaries and centrifuged (1000 g for 5min) to separate theplasma. Plasma samples were frozen at –80◦C until assay.Plasma glucose concentrations were then measured with aGlucose CII-Test Wako.2.8. Statistical Analysis. All IC50 values were calculated fromthe corresponding dose inhibition curve.

ΔAUC was calculated by subtractingthe AUC values from those in the no-olive oil or no-carbohydrate solution groups. Numerical data are expressedas means ± SD. Significance of diﬀerences was examined byanalysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s test. Results withP < .05 were considered to be significant.3. Results3.1. Inhibitory Eﬀects of AP on Lipase. Figure 1 shows theinhibitory eﬀects of AP and orlistat on lipase. Orlistat,a lipase inhibitor used as the positive control, stronglyinhibited lipase activity with an IC50 of 0.85 μgml−1. AP alsoconcentration-dependently inhibited lipase activity with anIC50 of 0.95mgml−1.3.2. Inhibitory Eﬀects of AP on α-Glucosidase. Figure 2 showsthe inhibitory eﬀects of AP and acarbose on maltase andsucrase. Acarbose, an α-glucosidase inhibitor used as thepositive control, strongly inhibited maltase and sucraseactivity with an IC50 of 0.071 and 0.49 μgml−1, respectively.AP also concentration-dependently inhibited maltase andsucrase activity with an IC50 of 0.22 and 0.60mgml−1,respectively.3.3. Oral Olive Oil Tolerance Test in Mice. Figure 3(a)shows the plasma triglyceride concentration profiles afteroral administration of AP solution and olive oil to mice.Figure 3(b) depicts the plasma triglyceride ΔAUC up to6 h post-administration. For olive oil alone administration,plasma triglyceride concentrations were highest at 90minpost-administration, followed by a gradual decline. APinhibited the rise in plasma triglyceride concentrations.Upon administration of 0.5 g kg−1 AP, triglyceride ΔAUCdecreased to about 40% that in the olive oil alone group.3.4. Oral Carbohydrate Tolerance Test in Mice. Figure 4 showsthe plasma glucose concentration profiles after oral admin-istration of AP solution and glucose, maltose, sucrose orstarch solution to mice. Figure 5 depicts the plasma glucoseΔAUC up to 3 h post-administration. For glucose, maltose,or sucrose solution administered alone, the plasma glucoseconcentrations were highest at 30min post-administrationand decreased gradually. With administration of 1 g kg−1AP, the rise in the plasma glucose concentrations afterglucose and sucrose loading was significantly inhibited. Inaddition, the eﬀect of AP on inhibiting the rise in glucoseconcentrations was greater after maltose loading than afterglucose or sucrose loading. Administration of 1 g kg−1 APresulted in a glucose ΔAUC of about 50% that for maltosealone. Furthermore, AP slightly inhibited the rise in plasmaglucose concentrations after starch loading.4. DiscussionObesity is caused by excess caloric intake [16], and thiscan be improved by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity andby inhibiting or delaying lipid absorption [17]. Inhibitionof α-glucosidase activity and inhibition of carbohydrateabsorption also play an important role in the prevention andtreatment of diabetes [18]. In this study, we performed invitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the eﬀects of APon lipid and carbohydrates absorption.AP significantly inhibited the rise in plasma triglyceridelevels after olive oil administration in mice (Figure 3).This eﬀect, based on results of the in vitro lipase activityinhibition test, is probably due to inhibition of lipase activity(Figure 1). The major constituents of AP are robinetinidoland fisetinidol, whose structures are similar to catechins[19–22]. Green tea polyphenols, which contain abundantcatechins, at 0.5mgml−1 have also been reported to inhibitthe activity of lipase to about 60% of control values [13];this inhibitory eﬀect is similar to that of AP observed inour study. In mice, oral administration of 1 g kg−1 applepolyphenols, which contain abundant proanthocyanidins,has been shown to inhibit lipid absorption, but applepolyphenols at 0.2 g kg−1 had no eﬀect on lipid absorption[23]. In our study, oral administration of 0.25 g kg−1 APto mice significantly inhibited lipid absorption, and at0.5 g kg−1 AP, changes in plasma triglyceride levels werealmost the same as those in normal controls (Figure 3). Asgreen tea polyphenols [24, 25] and apple polyphenols [23,26] have confirmed inhibitory eﬀects on lipid absorption andobesity in humans, AP, which also inhibits lipid absorption,may have inhibitory eﬀects against obesity in humans.AP inhibited the rise in plasma glucose concentrationsafter glucose loading (Figures 4 and 5). In the small intestine,glucose is absorbed into the blood via a sodium-dependentglucose transporter (SGLT) and glucose transporter (GLUT)4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine0 0.5 1 1.5 2Concentration (mg/mL)020406080100120Maltaseactivity(%)(a)0 0.5 1 1.5 2Concentration (mg/mL)020406080100120Sucraseactivity(%)(b)Figure 2: Inhibitory eﬀects of AP (filled circle) or acarbose (open circle) on maltase (a) or sucrase (b).

Polyphenols from acerola fruit have been reported toinhibit the rise in plasma glucose concentrations after glucoseloading in mice; this may be attributable to inhibition ofglucose uptake via SGLT and GLUT [8]. These findingssuggest that AP contains constituents similar to polyphenolsfrom acerola fruit and that these constituents, via inhibi-tion of glucose uptake, inhibit the rise in plasma glucoseconcentrations after glucose loading. AP also significantlyinhibited the rise in plasma glucose concentrations aftermaltose and sucrose loading in mice (Figures 4 and 5), andthe inhibitory eﬀects were more potent after maltose thansucrose loading. This finding corroborates the observationthat maltase inhibitory activity was almost 3-fold higherthan that of sucrase inhibitory activity (Figure 2). Catechinsand catechin gallates, which are present in green tea, havebeen reported to have 2- to 4-fold greater inhibitory activityagainst maltase than against sucrase [14], suggesting that APcontains constituents with similar eﬀects.

Data represent means ± SD (n = 8).inhibited the rise in plasma glucose concentrations afterstarch loading; this eﬀect was weaker than that after glucose,maltose and sucrose loading (Figures 4 and 5). Starch inmeals is hydrolyzed ultimately to glucose by amylase andthen absorbed into the body. Blocking amylase activity hasbeen eﬀective for the treatment of diabetes [28, 29]. Greentea polyphenols [30] and black tea polyphenols [31] stronglyinhibit amylase activity, and polyphenols in chestnut astrin-gent skin inhibit the rise in plasma glucose concentrationsafter starch loading [32]. Although the active constituentsof these polyphenols have not been identified, AP probablycontains constituents similar to these polyphenols.In similar studies, doses of 5–20mg kg−1 orlistat andacarbose have been shown to have very potent inhibitoryeﬀects on lipid absorption and on rises in plasma glucose,respectively [33–35]. These same inhibitory eﬀects werefound in our in vitro study with AP at 0.5–1.0 g kg−1 butwere markedly weaker than those of orlistat and acarbose.Incidentally, orlistat, which inhibits lipid absorption, isknown to have side eﬀects like steatorrhea for long-termadministration in many patients [17]. In contrast, long-term administration (7 weeks) of AP produced no stoolabnormalities (data not shown),most likely due to themilderlipase activity inhibition of AP than orlistat. Therefore, evenlong-term clinical administration of AP is less likely to causeside eﬀects.In recent years, polyphenols have been reported topossess antioxidant-like actions [36, 37]. Also, many ofthe natural extracts with antioxidant-like actions showedthe non-specific inhibition toward lipase and/or glucosidase6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine∗0 0.25 0.5 1050100150200250300Glucose (2 g/kg) + AP (g/kg)ΔAUC(mg/dL·hr)(a)∗∗∗∗∗0 0.25 0.5 1050100150200250300Maltose (2 g/kg) + AP (g/kg)ΔAUC(mg/dL·hr)(b)∗∗0 0.25 0.5 1050100150200250300400450350Sucrose (4 g/kg) + AP (g/kg)ΔAUC(mg/dL·hr)(c)0 0.25 0.5 1050100150200250300Starch (4 g/kg) + AP (g/kg)ΔAUC(mg/dL·hr)(d)Figure 5: Carbohydrate tolerance tests in mice.

AP has alsobeen reported to have antioxidant activities [39, 40]. Thesefindings indicate that AP inhibits these enzyme activitiesnon-specifically.We previously reported that AP exerts anti-obesity andanti-diabetic eﬀects by altering the expression of obesity-and diabetes-related genes in skeletal muscle, liver, and whiteadipose tissue [3]. In this study, AP showed inhibitory eﬀectson lipase and glucosidase activities, as well as on the risein plasma triglyceride and glucose concentrations after lipidand carbohydrate loading (Figure 6). These findings suggestthat the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic eﬀects of AP areattributable to not only to the absorbable constituents butalso to the non-absorbable constituents that play roles in thegastrointestinal tract.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7AcaciapolyphenolPancreatic lipaseMaltaseSucraseGlycerol + fatty acid GlucoseGlucose concentrationTriglyceride concentrationLipidBloodIntestineMaltoseSucroseFigure 6: Hypothetical mechanisms of anti-obesity/diabetic actions of acacia polyphenol.AcknowledgmentsThe authors express their sincere appreciation, and gratitudeto Prof. Edwin L.
