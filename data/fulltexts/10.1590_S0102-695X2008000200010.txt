ABSTRACT: Since the methanol extract of Lantana lilacina leaves collected in the city of Lavras 
(MG, Brazil) showed antibacterial properties in a preliminary study, a fractionation process guided 
by agar diffusion assays with Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
and Staphylococcus aureus was carried out to purify and identify the active compounds. After 
solvent partition and several chromatographic steps, [β-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-(3’-O-α-L-
rhamnopyranosyl)-(4’-O-cafeoyl)-β-D-glycopyranoside, known as acteoside, was isolated. The 
minimal inhibition concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration of such substance 
against A. hydrophila, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were 0.12, 1.00, 1.00 and 0.25 mg/
mL, respectively.
Keywords: Lantana lilacina, Verbenaceae, antibacterial activity, acteoside.
INTRODUCTION
Although pharmaceutical industries have 
produced a large number of new antimicrobial agents, 
the emergence of resistant bacterial strains has become 
a public health problem all over the world. In the United 
States of America, for instance, each year, 70% of the two 
million cases of bacterial infections acquired in hospitals 
consist of strains resistant to at least one antibacterial 
compound (Alexandria, 2004). Moreover, adverse effects 
and the high cost of the antimicrobial substances make 
the search for new effective drugs extremely necessary. 
As the biological activity of plants has been 
known since antiquity (Rios and Recio, 2005), a 
preliminary evaluation of local plant extracts was carried 
out to identify those with antimicrobial properties 
(Oliveira et al., 2007). During such study, a pronounced 
in vitro antibacterial property was observed for the aerial 
parts of Lantana lilacina Desf. (Verbenaceae), a 50-120 
cm height native Brazilian shrub, which produces pink 
or purple fl owers. Known as a weed and an ornamental 
plant (Lorenzi, 2000), it has been used in the traditional 
medicine to treat cold and bronchitis (Balbach, 1986). 
Although several substances have been identifi ed in 
other species of the Lantana genus (Begum et al., 2000; 
Siddiqui et al., 1995; Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006), only 
monoterpene glucoside esters were isolated from L. 
lilacina leaves (Dembitsky, 2004). No further studies 
concerning the chemical composition of this plant species 
have been found. Therefore, this research was aimed to 
purify and identify the antibacterial compounds present 
in the methanol extract of L. lilacina leaves.

Plant material
Leaves from Lantana lilacina Desf. 
(Verbenaceae) were collected in the city of Lavras, 
State of Minas Gerais (Brazil). Voucher specimens were 
identifi ed by Prof. Valéria E. G. Rodrigues and deposited 
in the Herbarium ESAL (ESAL 15.172), at Universidade 
Federal de Lavras, Lavras. 
General experimental procedures
All reagents used were of recognized analytical 
grade. Acetic acid, acetonitrile, and methanol were 
HPLC-grade (Vetec, Brazil). During the purifi cation 
steps, solvent concentration was carried out in a rotatory 
evaporator at 35 ºC, followed by 24 h in a freeze-drier. 
Except when mentioned otherwise, all fractions were 
submitted to antibacterial diffusion assays to direct 
purifi cation. Column chromatography was carried 
out on silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck). Mass 
spectra were obtained on an Agilent 1100 LC/MS Trap 
equipped with an electrospray interface. Samples (1.0 
mg) were dissolved in MeOH (1.0 mL) and 20 μL were 
directly injected into the interface at a fl ow rate of 5 μL/
min. Deuterated dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d6) and 
deuterated methanol (CD3OD) were used as solvents for 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses performed 
on a Varian Unit 500 instrument  using solvent peak as 
reference. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in both 
solvents, while HMBC, HMQC and TOCSY analyses 
were carried out only in DMSO-d6. 
Extraction and isolation
Fresh leaves of L. lilacina were exhaustively 
extracted with methanol at room temperature. Part of 
the crude extract (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of 
an ethanol:H2O (7:3; v/v) solution and submitted to 
the antibacterial diffusion assay. Another part (0.5 mg) 
of such extract was dissolved in 0.5 mL of an aqueous 
1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution and used in the broth 
microdilution assay. 
The crude extract (10.0 g) was subsequently 
washed with hexane (10 x 100 mL), ethyl acetate (AcOEt; 
10 x 100 mL) and methanol (MeOH; 10 x 100 mL). Part 
(3.5 g) of the MeOH fraction (M1) was successively 
eluted with MeOH, H2O and HCl 0.1 M through a silica 
gel column (4 x 15 cm). Part (1.8 g) of the resulting 
MeOH fraction (M2) was eluted with MeOH through a 
C-18 column (1 x 5 cm), yielding fraction M3 (1.0 g). 
Then, M3 was fractionated on a C-18 column (Luna 
C-18, 200 x 21.2 mm, 10 μM, Phenomenex, USA), 
using aqueous 0.1% acetic acid solution:MeOH (5% 
MeOH during 5 min, 5-100% MeOH during 60 min, 
100% MeOH for 21 min), at a fl ow rate of 30 mL/min, as 
eluent.  An UV detector set at 254 nm was employed to 
monitor the fractionation. One of the resulting fractions 
(F11; 169 mg; eluted between 18-19 min) was purifi ed 
on the same column employing aqueous 0.1% acetic acid 
solution:MeOH (62:38) as eluent, at a fl ow rate of 20 mL/
min. In this case the UV detector was set at 320 nm. This 
procedure yielded fraction 6 as a pure compound (F6; 15 
mg; eluted between 10.2-12.5 min), which was identifi ed 
as acteoside (Figure 1) by NMR and mass spectrometry 
analyses.
Antibacterial assays
Antibacterial activity was evaluated with four 
standard bacterial strains acquired from the American 
Type of Culture Collection (ATCC, USA): Bacillus 
subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 
25923 (Gram-positive), Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 
7966 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (Gram-
negative). Agar diffusion assays (NCCLS, 2003a) were 
carried out in duplicates. Briefl y, after bacterial growth 
in triptic soy agar (TSA, Acumedia, USA) during 24 h 
at 37 ºC, the resulting cultures were used to prepare cell 
suspensions in an aqueous 0.85% (g/mL) NaCl solution, 
at 0.5 turbidity according to MacFarland scale. Such 
suspensions were inoculated with a swab on the surface 
of Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck, Germany) Petri dishes 
and 40 μL of each sample were deposited into 6 mm 
diameter holes made on the inoculated medium. After 24 
h at 37 ºC, samples causing 7 mm or larger inhibition 
zone diameters around the holes were considered active.
Minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal 
concentrations (MIC and MBC) were determined by a 
broth microdilution assay (NCCLS, 2003b). A twofold 
serial dilution of the reference (chloramphenicol 
succinate: Sigma, USA; 400 μg/mL) and samples were 
prepared using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB: Biolife, 
Italy) supplemented with calcium and magnesium cations 
(Alderman and Smith, 2001). The crude extract was 
dissolved in an aqueous 1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution 
at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and fi ltered through a 
0.22 μm membrane (GV Durapore PVDF, Milipore, 
USA). 7.5 x 104 CFU were poured into each well and the 
initial extract concentration was 5.0 mg/mL. Aqueous 1% 
Tween 80 and chloramphenicol solutions were employed 
as negative and positive control, respectively. After 24 
h at 37 oC, 10 μL were withdrawn from each well with 
no bacterial growth and subcultured in TSA during 
24 h at the same temperature. MIC was considered the 
lowest concentration of the extract that prevented visible 
growth in the well during 24 h and MBC was defi ned 
as the lowest concentration yielding negative subcultures 
during 24 h. The isolated compound (acteoside, Figure 1) 
was also submitted to a broth microdilution assay. It (2 
mg) was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO (P.A.) and diluted 
with MHB. The highest acteoside’s concentration in the 
well was 1.0 mg/mL.

 As preliminarily observed (Oliveira et al., 2007), 
L. lilacina methanol extract was able to inhibit the growth 
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains 
(Table 1). 
During all purifi cation steps, only one active 
fraction was observed. Consequently, it seems that the 
antibacterial property of the crude extract was due only 
to the isolated substance, which amounted to 15 mg of a 
hygroscopic viscous oil that could get dark easily when 
exposed to light and air. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 
2), obtained in DMSO-d6, it was clear that most signals 
belonged to groups linked to heteroatoms (2.7-5.0 ppm) or 
unsaturated carbons (6.2-7.5 ppm). Such result suggested 
aromatic rings linked to carbohydrate units. The 13C 
NMR spectrum (Table 2) pointed to the same direction, 
since most signals were in the carbon sp3-heteroatom and 
carbon sp2 regions. Signals at 140 and 150 ppm suggested 
carbon sp2 - heteroatom groups, while the one at 165 
ppm seemed due to a carbonyl group, probably an ester 
(Silverstein and Webster, 1998; Pretsch et al., 1989). The

interpretation of TOCSY 1D, 1H and 13C NMR spectra, 
as well as heteronuclear correlations at short (HMQC) 
and long distances (HMBC), permitted to attribute 
the structure of the [β-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-
(3’-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-(4’-O-cafeoyl)-β-D- 
glycopyranoside, known as acteoside or verbascoside 
(Figure 1), to the isolated compound. It is worth to 
mention that the stereochemistry of the caffeoyl moiety 
was clear in the 1H spectrum, since the coupling constant 
(J) between H7 and H8 was 16 Hz, which is characteristic 
of a trans arrangement (Silverstein and Webster, 1998)
Although the spectra obtained in DMSO-d6 were 
in accordance with NMR data reported for the acteoside 
dissolved in the same solvent (Tanaka et al., 2004), 
CD3OD was also used, since it could afford a simpler 
1H 
NMR spectrum. As a consequence, the α-L-rhamnose 
moiety with OR (linked to C1’’’) and OH (linked to C2’’’) 
in the axial positions was confi rmed by the low J between 
H1’’’ and H2’’’ (J = 1.5 Hz, equatorial-equatorial). In the 
β-D-glucose unit, the trans-diaxial couplings (6.0 - 9.3 
Hz) became clear for all hydrogen atoms linked to the 
ring. Moreover, NMR spectra obtained in CD3OD were 
totally in agreement with the fi ndings of Wu et al. (2004) 
and Owen et al. (2003) for the acteoside.
The mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated 
compound in the negative mode showed peaks at m/z 623 
[M-H]− and 659 [M+Cl]−. Experiments inducing m/z 623 
to fragmentation resulted in m/z 461 [M-H-162]− (MS2) 
and m/z 315 [M-H-162-146]− (MS3), corresponding to 
caffeoyl and rhamnose units loss, respectively. In the 
positive mode, as observed by Plaza et al. (2005), peaks 
were detected at m/z 647 [M+Na]+ and 501 [M+Na-146]+ 
(MS2), which was due to the rhamnose unit loss.
Once there was no doubt that the isolated 
compound was the acteoside, a microdilution assay 
was carried out to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. 
Specifi cally with A. hydrophila and S. aureus, MIC and 
MBC values were very close to those obtained with 
chloramphenicol (Table 3). These results are in agreement 
with those reported by Didry et al (1999), who observed 
Proteus mirabilis and S. aureus growth inhibition by the 
acteoside at 0.128 mg/mL, during an agar dilution assay. 
Similarly, Lima et al. (2003) observed that a mixture of 
acteoside and isoacteoside showed MIC of 0.6 mg/mL 
against S. aureus and B. subtilis. According to Avila et 
al. (1999), acteoside inhibits S. aureus leucine admission, 
which stops protein synthesis and kills such bacterium. 
Unfortunately, P. aeruginosa, a bacterium resistant 
to several drugs (Barros, 2001), was able to grow in 
the presence of L. lilacina  crude  extract. Moreover, 
acteoside’s MIC and MBC against this microorganism 
were both 1 mg/mL, which is a high value when compared 
to other substances (Ng et al., 1996; Ogundipe et al., 
2001; Lima et al., 2003).
It is worth to mention that other biological 
activities have also been attributed to acteoside: protein 
kinase C inhibitor (Herbert et al.,1991); antitumor and 
immunosuppressive (Zhang et al., 2002; Ohno et al., 
2002); antioxidant (Ono et al., 2005; Owen et al., 2003; 
Aligiannia et al., 2003); and antiinfl ammatory (Diaz et 
al., 2004).
In conclusion, for the fi rst time it is shown that 
the antibacterial activity of L. lilacina leaves methanol 
extract is due to the presence of acteoside, a compound 
largely distributed in the plant kingdom. As observed in 
this study and by other research groups, such substance 
should be better evaluated by pharmacological and 
chemical assays aiming at the pharmaceutical use, either 
in humans or animals.
