ABSTRACT: Austroplenckia populnea (Mangabarana) is popularly used by people from Minas 
Gerais, Brazil for dysenteries diseases treatment. Antitumor and antiulcer activities were also 
attributed to this plant. Extracts obtained using solvents of different polarities and pentacyclic 
triterpenes (PCTTs) isolated from these extracts through phytochemical methods were submitted 
to antibacterial assays. The results showed the existence of this activity and open perspectives for 
news studies with other organic compounds isolated from this plant. 
Keywords: Austroplenckia populnea, Celastraceae, antibacterial activity, pentacyclic triterpenes.
INTRODUCTION
The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has been 
caused bacterial resistance, allergic sensibility, blocking 
of natural fermentation processes and other adverse 
biological effects. This fact induces the development 
of new antibiotics with a good efficacy and with low 
incidence of adverse effects.
Ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological 
studies have shown that products obtained from 
plant can present healing action related to specific 
pathologies. Consequently, a great variety of medicinal 
plants have been investigated to evaluate and validate 
their real biological activity (Cardoso and Santos, 1948; 
Kinghorn and Balandrin, 1993; Rao, 1996; Gnan and 
Demello, 1999; Hernandez et al., 2000; Deena et al., 
2000; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008). The use of plants 
and their derivatives for different diseases occurs 
since the beginning of the humanity (Antunes et al., 
2006). With the advances of pharmaceutical industries, 
mainly after World War II, the use of herbal medicines 
diminishes in function of the dissemination idea of 
its inefficiency (Antunes et al., 2006). However, the 
efficacy and trustworthiness in medicinal plant products 
have demonstrated the real value of these materials. 
Brazil have a great diversity of native plants (Mors, et 
al., 2000, Barbosa-Filho, et al., 2005, Brandão, et al., 
2006; Quintans-Júnior et al., 2008), but its medicinal 
properties had had not been adequately studied yet. 
The scientific study of plants used in folk medicine is 
essential to lower the adverse effect risk for populations 
(Agra et al., 2008). 
 Frequent deforestation and fires are threatening 
a substantial number of native plant species with 
extinction. The Autroplenckia populnea Reissek, specie 
of the Celastraceae family is among of them. This 
plant, commonly known as “Mangabarana”, “Marmelo-
do-campo” or “Mangabeira-brava”, can be found in a

Evaluation of antibacterial activity of “Mangabarana” Austroplenckia populnea Reissek (Celastraceae)
vast tropical ecoregion known as “Cerrado” mainly 
in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and has been of 
great interest to researchers because of its chemical 
constituents, larvicidal effect, and molluscicidal effect 
(Vichnewski et al., 1984).
Other biological activities were also attributed 
to Austroplenckia populnea including antidysenteric 
action (Correa, 1969), antitumoral action (Monache, 
1972) and antirheumatic action (Gonzalez et al., 1982). 
In relation to the dysenteries, it is important to point 
out that epidemiological studies indicate high E. coli 
prevalence, mainly in people who live in Brazilian 
cities peripheries (Tavares-Dias & Grandini, 1999), 
and, are exactly these people that use A. populnea 
and other medicinal plants more frequently. Previous 
studies demonstrate antibacterial activity of the 
following pentacyclic triterpenes (PCTTs) isolated 
from Austroplenckia populnea: abruslactone-A, 
3-epiabruslactone-A, populnilic acid, polpuninic 
acid and katononic acid (Vieira Filho et al., 1999). 
Treatment of adult Wistar rats with hexane extract 
obtained from dried Austroplenckia populnea leaves 
showed an antispermatogenic action characterized by 
a significant decrease of the epididymis spermatozoa 
number (Mazaro et al., 2000). Anti-Trypanossoma 
cruzi effect presented by the PCTTs epikatonic acid and 
20-hydroxy-tingenone isolated from A. populnea was 
also related (Duarte et al., 2002).
The isolation and identification of other PCTTs, 
sesquiterpenes and other chemical constituents from this 
specie have been reported by several authors (Monache, 
1972; Vichnewski et al., 1984; Souza et al,. 1988; Souza 
et al., 1990; Silva et al., 2002; Vieira Filho et al., 1999; 
Vieira Filho et al., 2000; Vieira Filho et al., 2001; Cotta 
et al., 1990 a, b).
The objectives of this work involve the 
antibacterial evaluation of the A. Populnea extracts 
obtained using solvents of different polarities and the 
PCTTS isolated from them, followed by determination 
of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and 
by the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). 
Because of the previous antibacterial effect identified 
for some PCTTS (Vieira Filho et al., 1999) and the 
popular use of the decoct from A. Populnea branches as 
an antidysenteric (Correa, 1969), the PCTTS friedelin 
(1), 3β-friedelinol (2), 28-hydroxyfriedelin (canofilol) 
(3), populnonic acid (4), katononic acid (6), epikatonic 
acid (8), pristimerin (10), abruslactone A (11) and 
a-amirin (12) isolated from Austroplenckia populnea 
and the transformation products: methyl populnonate 
(5), methyl katotonate (7) and methyl epikatonate (9) 
(Figure 1) were tested to determine the in vitro bacterial 
activity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant
 A. Populnea was collected in the proximities 
of Miguelão Lake, at Nova Lima city region, Minas 
Gerais, Brazil. This plant was identified by Prof. Wagner 
Pedersoli (in memoriam). A sample of the collected 
material was compared and identified with a voucher 
specimen (No 10473) deposited at the Herbarium of the 
Natural History Museum of Universidade Federal de 
Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
Extracts obtainment
Leaves, branches, (bark and heartwood) and 
root were separated and dried over kraft paper at room 
temperature. After fragmentation on a mill, each part 
was submitted to continuous extraction process in a 
Soxhlet apparatus using hexane, chloroform, ethyl 
acetate, methanol and n-butanol as solvent extractor.
Afterwards, each extract was submitted column 
chromatography (CC), flash-CC, high-pressure liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and other phytochemical 
methods. By these processes it was possible to 
isolate the PCTTs: friedelin (1), 3β-friedelinol (2), 
28-hydroxyfriedelin (canofilol) (3), populnonic acid (4), 
catononic acid (6), epikatonic acid (8), pristimerin (10), 
abruslactone A (11) and a-amirin (12). The PCTTs (4), 
(6) and(8) were esterified to obtain methyl populnonate 
(5), methyl katotonate (7) and methyl epikatonate (9), 
respectivaly. Infrared (IR), mass spectrometry (MS) and 
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C NMR including 
2D experiments) were used to elucidate the chemical 
structure of the compounds (Souza et al., 1990; Vieira 
Filho et al., 1999; Vieira Filho et al., 2000; Vieira Filho 
et al., 2001; Cotta et al., 1990; Silva et al., 2002; Zanon 
et al., 2008).
Antibacterial activity preliminary assays
Chloroform extract obtained from the bark 
(ChE) and from the heartwood of the branches (HChE) 
were submitted to qualitative microbiological tests 
against wild-type strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 
Escherichia coli, both sensitive to vancomicin through 
Bawer & Kirby disc diffusion method (Bawer and 
Kirby, 1966) (Table 2). 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 
extracts
Through microdilution technique, four samples 
(2 mg/mL initial concentration) of A. populnea extracts 
were submitted to microbiological assays to determine 
the growth minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 21027), Proteus

vulgaris (ATCC 13315), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
(ATCC 15442), Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536) and 
Staphylococcus aureus (MARSA), microorganisms 
commonly found in human infectious diseases. All 
experiments were carried out in triplicate and the 
average rate found was the rate taken in account (Table 
3).
Evaluation of minimum bactericidal concentration 
of the extracts
After the MIC have been established, aliquots 
of the extracts in which growth inhibition was 
observed were inoculated onto Muller-Hinton agar and 
incubated at 37 oC, during 24 hours. Each experiment 
was performed in triplicate and a non-growth in the 
cultivation conditions showed the minimum bactericidal 
concentration of the extract (Table 4). 
Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the 
constituents isolated from A. populnea
The PCTTs 1 to 12 (Figure 1) were respectively 
dissolved in chloroform. Each chloroform solution was 
impregnated in sterile Whatmann paper discs (6.0 mm 
diameter) to obtain five different PCTT concentrations, 
after solvent evaporation. Dried discs containing PCTT 
were deposited on the surface of agar Müller-Hinton 
previously inoculated with Salmonela typhimurium, 
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia 
coli ATCC 25922 or Shigella sonnei ATCC 11060, in 
according to Bawer & Kirby method (Bawer and Kirby, 
1966). Oxacillin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, clindamycin 
and chloramphenicol were used as internal standards. 
The analysis of the results was done after 24 
hours of incubation at 37 oC. The samples that produced 
inhibition halos equal or superior to 7 mm were considered 
active. Each experiment was developed using five Petri 
plates. Discs were soaked individually with each one 
of the solvents that were used for the incorporation of 
the compounds to be tested. After the process of drying, 
these discs also were submitted to growth inhibition 
tests to verify possible interferences caused by the 
presence of residual nonvolatile compound. For these 
discs, any growth inhibition halo was detected, which 
demonstrated the purity of the solvents used and the 
efficiency of the evaporation process.

Evaluation of antibacterial activity of “Mangabarana” Austroplenckia populnea Reissek (Celastraceae)
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The antibacterial activity of five pentacyclic 
triterpenes isolated from Autroplenckia populnea extracts 
was previously reported in relation to Escherichia 
coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermides 
and Salmonella sp. (Vieira Filho et al., 1999). The 
results obtained in this work demonstrated that among 
the studied extracts, four of them, with polar character, 
also showed antibacterial activity. The butanol (BBE) 
and ethyl acetate (BEaE) extracts obtained from 
Austroplenckia populnea branches bark showed activity 
against S. aureus (ATCC 21027). The methanol extract 
from branches bark (BME) also showed activity against

Oxacyclin: 29 µg (1 mm); Tetracyclin: 24 µg (30 mm).
S. aureus (MARSA) and S. aureus (ATCC 21027) and 
inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa (ATCC 15442). 
The growth of this microorganism also was inhibited by 
root methanol extract (RME) (Table 3). 
The corroboration of antibacterial activity of 
the vegetable extracts evaluated in this work suggests 
more accurate phytochemical studies to quantify and 
identify other biologically active chemical substances, 
which can be pointed as sources of new antibiotics.
None of the PCTTs (Table 5) showed activity 
against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. It can be observed 
that despite the fact that the chloroform extract obtained 
from the bark and from the heartwood of the branches 
showed activity against S. aureus (Table 3). When 
abruslactone A (11) a PCTT isolated from this extract 
(200 µg/disc) was submitted to a test by plate cavity 
method, it showed activity against S. aureus ATCC 
25923 (Vieira Filho et al., 1999).
Salaspermic acid was also isolated from the 
chloroform extract of the Autroplenckia populnea 
heartwood of the branches. In according to the literature, 
this PCTT showed anti-HIV activity (Chen et al., 1992). 
It allows the premise that the activity of this extract 
should be due to the presence of this compound, that 
was not tested in this work, or of other substance found 
in the plant. The data presented in Table 5, show that all 
the PCTTs showed activity against Shigella sonnei.
For E. coli it was observed that compounds 
3, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 12 showed low activity (Table 5). 
Compound 10 showed significant activity against E. 
coli. On the other hand, this compound was inactive 
when tested against E. coli ATCC st330/84. It was 
observed that the strains tested are different, which can 
justify this difference in antibacterial action answer 
(Vieira Filho et al., 1999). 
The results stimulate the accomplishment of 
new experiments where new tests must be performed, 
using other pathogenic bacteria, others PCTTs and 
respective derivatives in order to establish chemical 
structure versus antibacterial activity correlations.
