Introduction
The triterpenes are a large group of plant substances
with a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-
HIV1. The study of the Eugenia florida DC (Myrtaceae)
leaves, which occur in the areas of tropical and subtropical2
climate, is underway in our laboratories. In this work an
unpublished triterpene with skeleton nor-lupane was iden-
tified. The identification of its structure was made through
the use of spectroscopic methods. The homonuclear 1H-1H
and one bond and multiple bond heteronuclear 1H-13C
correlations experiments were used as the main tools to
identify this new compound.
Results and Discussions
The structural determination of 1 was done on the basis
of a comparative analysis of its 1H and 13C-NMR 1D and
2D data with those reported in the literature for platanic
acid1,3,4. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1, it was observed the
presence of 5 methyl signals, δ 0.77, 0.85, 0.94, 0.96 and
1.07 (Table 1). The signal at δ 2.21 of the CH3-29, which
is characteristic of platanic acid1 was not detected. At δ
3.26, it was observed a triplet (J = 7.6 Hz) of the Hax
bounded to C-3, which was coupled with H-2. The multi-
plet appearing at δ 3.36-3.43 corresponds to H-19, coupled
with H-18 and H-21. The COSY 1H-1H spectrum of 1 (Fig.
1) also exhibited several important correlations to establish
the triterpene skeleton and the attribution of the 1H chemi-
cal shifts (Table 1) was supported by these data. From the
DEPT 135 experiment it was possible to determine that 1
was a primary alcohol, which justifies the fact that 1
showed only 5 methyl groups, instead of 6 as in platanic
acid. The location of the hydroxyl group at CH2-29 (δ 68.6),
whose 1H signals appeared as two doublets at δ 4.40 and
4.32 (J = 18.8 Hz) and the attribution of the chemical shifts
of all methyl groups, was carried out by analysis of the
HMBC spectrum (Figs. 2 and 3). It was noticed the un-
equivocal correlation of the two methyl groups, H-23 (δ
1.07) and H-24 (δ 0.85) with C-3 at δ 78.1 (3J, Table 1),
and with the carbons C-5 at δ 55.7, and C-4 at δ 39.2 (2J).
It was also noticed the correlation of the methyl H-25 (δ
0.77) with C-10 at δ 37.4 (2J) and of two methyl groups,
H-26 and H-27 with C-8 at δ 40.9 (respectively 2J and 3J).
H-29 showed correlation with the carbonyl at δ 214.2
(C-20)3.
The presence of the sugar moiety in the molecule was
verified by the signal of the anomeric hydrogen detected at

δ 5.95 (d, J = 8.4 Hz), confirmed by other signals between
δ 3.70 and 4.36. The inspection of the COSY 1H-1H spec-
trum (Fig. 1), relatively to the glucosyl unit, allowed to
establish the correlation between the hydrogens H-1’ to
H-6’. The inspection of the HMQC spectrum of 1 (Fig. 2,
Table 1) showed correlation of H-1’-H-6’ signals with the
signals at δ 95.5, 73.6, 78.3, 70.9, 78.2 and 62.0, C-1’ to
C-6’ respectively. These signals and these correlations are
the same registered in the literature for β-D-glucose7. After
having assigned the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the sugar
moiety, it was still remaining to locate this unit in the
nor-lupane skeleton at the position C-3, C-28 or C-29. The
13C-NMR spectrum showed a carbonyl carbon signal at δ
174.7, shielded by 4.0 ppm, which occurs when C-28 is an
ester function5,6. This functionality was confirmed by the
HMBC spectrum (Table 1, Fig. 3), whose 1H signal at δ
5.95 was correlated to the carbonyl carbon at δ 174.7 (3J).
This unequivocally confirmed that the position C-28 was
indeed esterified with β-D-glucose.
Finally, the mass spectrum of 1, obtained by FAB/MS,
revealed the peak corresponding to the molecular ion (m/z
637, M+1, 3%), and the peaks 636 (5), 473 (20), 275 (32),
183 (100) Daltons.
These data allowed to attribute the structure of 1 as
being 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester of 29-hydroxypla-
tanic acid which is now described for the first time in the
literature. 
Experimental
General experimental procedure
The 1H and 13C-NMR experiments were recorded in a
Bruker spectrometer ARX, operating respectively at 400
MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using deutero pyridin

(C5D5N) as solvent, with TMS as internal standard. HMQC
and HMBC data were acquired using the microprogram
invbtp (J = 145 and 9 Hz respectively). Melting point:
Kofler block (Rochester) with one non calibrated ther-
mometer. FT/IR: Bomen spectrometer, model M 102, KBr
(1% of sample). For the chromatographic analysis a droplet
countercurrent chromatograph Eyela DCC-300 model,
equipped with 300 columns (42.0 x 0.3 cm) and also a
R-HPLC Shimadzu, model CR4A equipped with UV de-
tector Shimadzu model SPD-6AV were used.
Plant material
Leaves of Eugenia florida DC, were collected in Feb-
ruary of l991, in the Ecological reserve of the Luís Antônio
- São Paulo, Brazil and identified by Drs. José Rubens
Pirani (USP) and Marcos Sobral (UFRGS). The respective
voucher was deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto de
Biociências of University of São Paulo-SP (SPF 75745).
The leaves were dried separately in a stove with circulating
air at 40 °C and grounded in a Willey mill.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents
The leaves (541 g) were extracted consecutively with
hexane (3 x 1 L), dichloromethane (3 x 1 L) and methanol
(3 x 1 L) with intervals of 3 days between each extraction
at room temperature. After distillation of the solvents, it
was obtained in each extract 3.9 g, 4.7 g and 5.1 g of solid
residues. The residue obtained from the MeOH extraction
(5.1 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatog-
raphy, using CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (5:5:3 v/v) as solvent,
with the organic layer being the mobile one. After 48 h of
analysis, 200 fractions, 13 mL each, were collected and
combined into 8 groups based on the results from analytical
TLC. The fraction 67-74 (15 mg) was crystallized in metha-
nol:acetone (9:1) and submitted to recycling-HPLC. Solu-
tions of 7.5 mg mL-1 in MeOH were prepared and 2 mL of
these solutions were chromatographed on polymeric pack-
ing column (Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm L)
using MeOH for elution with a flow rate of 8 mL min-1. The
UV detector was set at 215 nm. Three cycles of 60 min
afforded compound 1 (9 mg, 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl
ester of 29-hydroxyplatanic acid), solid, mp 240-241 °C.
