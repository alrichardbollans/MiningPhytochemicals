A series of phenylphenalenone type compounds, known to play a role as phytoalexins in plants of
the Musaceae family, have been identified for the first time in the leaf fibers of abaca (Musa textilis).
Among the phenylphenalenone type compounds identified, the structure of a novel compound, (1R)-
2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-8-methoxy-1-phenylphenalene, has also been described in abaca fibers.
Its structure was elucidated by analysis of one- and two-dimensional NMR (correlation spectroscopy,
heteronuclear single quantum correlation, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) spectroscopic
data.

INTRODUCTION
A series of phytoalexins structurally based on a phenalenone
skeleton have been described in plants of the Musaceae family,
including Musa and Ensete species. These compounds have been
found in banana plants (Musa paradisiaca and Musa acuminata)
infected with Mycosphaerella fijiensis (causal agent of Black
Sigatoka disease), a pathogenic fungus that attacks banana
leaves, or infected with Fusarium oxysporum, a saprophytic
pathogenic fungus that causes Panama disease in banana plants
(1-4). Indeed, phenylphenalenone type phytoalexins were also
isolated from anthracnose-infected banana fruits (5, 6) and also
from M. acuminata infected with the burrowing nematode
Radopholus similes (7). Because of their intense red or orange
color, phenylphenalenones are visually detectable in pigmented
roots and rhizomes, which seem to be the richest source of these
natural products. In addition to these parts, phenylphenalenone-
type compounds have also been detected in other parts of the
plant, such as infected leaves (8, 9).
Abaca (M. textilis) is a banana-like plant of the Musa species
grown mainly in the Philippines. Its fiber, also known as Manila
hemp, is obtained from the leaf sheath and has been traditionally
used for ropes and cordage. Indeed, it is an excellent raw
material for the manufacturing of specialty papers. Its long fiber
length, high strength, and fineness make it a superior material
for the production of thin, lightweight papers of high porosity
and excellent tear, burst, and tensile strengths (10, 11). The abaca
fibers used for papermaking are usually pale to white colors;
however, intense red color parts are often distinguished. Because
abaca, like other Musa species, suffers from similar diseases as
banana (M. acuminata or M. paradisiaca) (12, 13), it is possible
that these red color parts might be due to the presence in the
fiber of phenylphenalenone type or related compounds.
In this paper, we have analyzed the acetone extracts of two
parts of the same batch of abaca leaf fibers with different
coloration in order to get insight into their chemical differences.
The identification and structural elucidation of phenylphenale-
none type phytoalexins in abaca fibers are described here for
the first time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples. The leaf fibers from abaca (M. textilis) were supplied by
CELESA pulp mill (Tortosa, Spain). Two distinct parts of the fiber
having different coloration, light and red colors, were separated
manually. The air-dried fibers (around 50 g) were milled using a knife
mill (Janke and Kunkel, Analysenmu¨hle) and extracted with acetone
in a Soxhlet apparatus for 8 h. The extracts were evaporated to dryness
and redissolved in chloroform for chromatographic analysis. Two
replicates were used for each sample, and all of them were subjected
to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses.
Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Fractionation. The lipid extracts
were fractionated by a SPE procedure using aminopropyl phase
cartridges (500 mg) from Waters (Division of Millipore). The dried
chloroform extracts were taken up in a minimal volume (<0.5 mL) of
hexane:chloroform (4:1) and loaded into the cartridge column previously
conditioned with hexane (4 mL). The cartridge was loaded and eluted
by gravity. The column was first eluted with 8 mL of hexane and
subsequently with 6 mL of hexane:chloroform (5:1), then with 10 mL
of chloroform, and finally with 10 mL of diethyl ether:acetic acid (98:
2). Each isolated fraction was dried under nitrogen and analyzed by
GC/MS.

Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC). For the isolation and puri-
fication of selected compounds, the acetone extracts were subjected to
TLC. Preparative silica gel plates (Merck) were used for that purpose.
The plates were loaded with the extracts and subsequently developed
with a mixture of hexane:diethyl ether (80:20). The band at Rf 0.16
was scraped off the plate and extracted with chloroform, and the extracts
were subsequently dried under a stream of nitrogen. The purified
compound was subsequently analyzed by NMR.
GC/MS. The GC/MS analyses were performed on a Varian Saturn
2000 (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) with an ion trap detector, equipped
with a fused silica capillary column (DB-5HT, J&W; 12 m  0.25
mm i.d., 0.1 ím film thickness). The oven was heated from 120 (1
min) to 380 °C at 10 °C/min and held for 5 min. The transfer line was
kept at 300 °C. The injector was temperature programmed from 120
(0.1 min) to 380 °C at a rate of 200 °C/min and held until the end of
the analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 2 mL/min.
Trimethylsilyl-diazomethane methylation and bis(trimethylsilyl)tri-
fluoroacetamide (BSTFA) silylation, in the presence of pyridine, and
acetylation with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine were used
to produce the appropriate derivatives, when required. Compounds were
identified by comparing their mass spectra with those in the Wiley
and NIST computer libraries, with those reported in the literature, and
when possible by comparison with authentic standards. Quantitation
was performed by peak area using appropriate standards as described
previously (14).
NMR. The spectra of the samples, dissolved in deuterated chloroform
(ca. 10 mM), were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer
equipped with a triple resonance 1H, 13C, and 15N probe with a gradient
in the Z axis, at a temperature of 300 °”. Chemical shifts are in ppm
with respect to the 0 ppm point of the manufacturer’s indirect
referencing method. The assignments of the signals were performed
according to the standard correlation spectroscopy (COSY), nuclear
Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), heteronuclear single
quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple bond correla-
tion (HMBC) sequences provided by Bruker.
COSY and NOESY experiments were performed with 16 and 48
scans, respectively, with 256 increments in the indirect dimension and
with 2048 points in the acquisition dimension. The spectral widths were
9 ppm in both dimensions. The HSQC experiment (16 scans) also used
256 increments in the indirect dimension with 2048 points in the
acquisition dimension. The spectral width was 150 ppm in the indirect
dimension and 9 ppm in acquisition. The HMBC experiment (32 scans)
also used 256 increments in the indirect dimension with 2048 points
in the acquisition dimension. The spectral width was 180 ppm in the
indirect dimension and 9 ppm in acquisition.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A comparison of the acetone extracts from the two different
parts of the abaca fibers revealed noticeable differences between
them. The total acetone extract from the light color parts of the
abaca fibers accounted for 0.22% of the total fiber weight, while
the acetone extract from the dark color fibers accounted for
0.36%. Indeed, the acetone extracts from the dark color fibers
presented a characteristic and intense red color. Therefore, it
seems clear that there is a significant difference in the content
and composition of the extractable material in both parts of the
fibers and that the compounds present in the latter extract might
be responsible for the coloration of the fibers.
The acetone extracts were subsequently analyzed by GC/MS.
Figure 1 shows the chromatograms of the underivatized extracts
from the two different parts of the abaca fibers. The GC/MS
analysis of both parts also revealed a different pattern of
compounds present in the extracts. The extracts of the light color
part of the abaca fibers (Figure 1A) were constituted mainly
by fatty acids such as palmitic acid (C16), oleic acid (C18:1),
linoleic acid (C18:2), stearic acid (C18), and sterols such as
campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol, steroid ketones such
as cycloartenone, 24-methylenecycloartanone, stigmasta-3,5-
dien-7-one, stigmast-4-en-3-one, and stigmastane-3,6-dione, and
a series of p-hydroxycinnamic acids (p-coumaric and ferulic
acids) esterified to long chain alcohols and ö-hydroxyfatty acids
and sterol esters. The complete characterization, including lipid
and lignin composition, of the abaca fibers has already been
published elsewhere (14, 15).
By contrast, the chromatogram of the extracts of the dark
color parts of the fibers (Figure 1B) shows, besides the
compounds also present in the light color fiber, a new series of
peaks (I-VII) that were not present in the light color fibers
and which seem responsible for the dark coloration of the fiber
and the acetone extract. Among these compounds, the chro-
matogram was clearly dominated by compound V, which is by
far the most abundant compound in the extract. Most of these
compounds were identified by mass spectrometry as being
phenylphenalenone type compounds (Figure 2). These com-
pounds corresponded to the known compounds anigorufone (I),
2-hydroxy-4-phenylphenalen-1-one (II), methoxyanigorufone
(III), 9-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methoxyphenalen-1-one (IV), 4′-
methoxyirenolone (VI), and 2-methoxy-9-(4′-methoxyphenyl)-
phenalen-1-one (VII) and were identified according to the mass
spectra published in the literature (5, 16). All of these
compounds have been detected previously in other Musa species,
although this is the first time that they have been reported in
abaca. However, the mass spectrum of compound V (Figure
3), which gives a molecular ion at m/z 306 that is also the base
peak and important fragments at m/z 273, 229, 227, 211, and
197, does not correspond to any known compound. Appropriate
derivatization to produce the acetyl or the TMS derivatives
indicates the presence of two hydroxyl groups in its structure,
but no further structural data could be obtained from the low-
resolution MS.
Compound V was therefore further purified and concentrated
by TLC and the structure elucidated using HR-MS as well as
1H, 13C, and two-dimensional NMR (COSY, HMBC, and
HMQC) techniques. Compound V was obtained as an intense
red solid (optical rotation -0.073, c 0.1, ClCH3). A molecular
formula of C20H18O3 (m/z obs. 306.125590, calcd 306.125595)
was assigned using HR-MS. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1)
of V displayed signals corresponding to two ortho-coupled
aromatic protons (ä 6.89, d, J ) 8.5 Hz; ä 7.44, d, J ) 8.5
Hz), five aromatic protons of monosubstituted phenyl ring (ä
6.90, dd, J ) 7.0, 1.0 Hz; ä 7.08, ddd, J ) 7.0, 7.0, 1.0 Hz;
and ä 7.13, dd, J ) 7.0, 7.0 Hz), and one aromatic proton of a
pentasubstituted phenyl ring (ä 6.98). The COSY spectrum
indicated that the signals located at ä 2.12 (dddd J ) 13.0, 13.0,
4.0, 4.0), ä 2.23 (dddd J ) 13.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5), ä 2.44 (ddd, J
) 16.0, 13.0, 4.0), and ä 2.84 (ddd, J ) 16.0, 4.0, 2.5)
corresponded to two vicinal methylenes and one of them is
coupled directly bound to a benzylic methane, whose signal is
located at ä 4.74 (dd, J ) 4.0, 2.5 Hz). The presence of a
methoxyl group (ä 3.90) at the quaternary carbon C-8 (ä 145.57)
was established from the analysis of the HMBC spectrum.
Furthermore, the presence of two hydroxyl hydrogens (located
at ä 5.80 s and ä 4.65 br s) was established by the lack of cross-
peaks for these signals in the HSQC spectrum. The connectivity
of these fragments was made by the analysis of the HMBC data,
establishing the characteristic phenylphenalenone type structure.
The analysis started with two J2 and J3 correlations between
each one of ortho-coupled aromatic protons, H-5 and H-6, with
the phenolic quaternary carbon (C-4, located at ä 148.21). The
phenolic hydrogen at ä 5.80 showed J2 cross-peaks with the
adjacent C-9 (located at ä 142.24) and J3 with the C-8 (located
at ä145.57). Additionally, the signal for H-7 (ä 6.98) exhibited
Phenylphenalenones from Abaca J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 54, No. 23, 2006 8745
a J3 correlation with the quaternary carbon at C-9. The presence
of naphthalene skeleton was evident by the presence of J3 cross-
peaks assigned to H-6 (ä 7.44)/H-7 (ä 6.98) with C-9b (ä
127.37) and H-5 (ä 6.89) with C-6a (ä 123.71). Furthermore,
the HMBC correlations of the benzylic methine assigned to H-1
(ä 4.74) with the quaternary carbon C-9a (ä 117.64), as well as
the J2 and J3 cross-peaks of the benzylic methylene H-3a,3e
with C-3a (ä 116.08) and the phenolic carbon C-4 (148.21),
respectively, allowed us to confirm the C(-1)-C(9a) and C(3)-
C(3a) connectivities of the phenalene nucleus. Additionally,

long-range correlations of H-2a, 2e (ä 2.12, ä 2.24), and H-1
with the ipso carbon C-1 (ä 144.54) located the monosubstituted
phenyl ring at C-1. HSQC cross-peaks completed the assign-
ments of the hydrogenated carbon atoms (Table 1).
The relative configuration of V was determined by the
coupling constants of aliphatic part and from the observed
NOESY cross peaks. The pseudo equatorial orientation of H-1
was established by the coupling constants (4.0, 2.5 Hz), and
the large trans-axial coupling constant of H-2a with H-3a (13.0
Hz) indicated a pseudo-chair conformation of this ring. Con-
sistently with these observations, H-2′, 6′ showed NOE interac-
tions with the H-2e and H-3a indicating that these protons are
oriented to the same side of the monosubstituted phenyl ring.
Additional NOE cross-peaks were observed for H-7 with the
methoxyl group and H-6. Therefore, the structure of the new
natural compound was determined as (1R)-2,3-dihydro-4,9-
dihydroxy-8-methoxy-1-phenylphenalene (Figure 4), and to the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it has been
described. Structurally, this compound is related to a phenylphe-
nalenone type dimer isolated from Anigozanthos flaVidus, a
species of the Haemodoraceae plant family (17). Other dihy-
drophenalenes, structurally related to compound V, are also
known in M. acuminata (3, 5).
Phenylphenalenones represent a class of phenylpropanoid-
derived natural products that occur in the Musaceae (genera
Musa and Ensete) (1-4, 18) as well as in other plant families
such as the Haemodoraceae (19), Pontederiaceae (20), and
Strelitziaceae (21). Phenylphenalenones from Musaceae and
Haemodoraceae are of special interest because of their potential
role as phytoalexins and phytoanticipins (1-4, 22, 23). How-
ever, despite their occurrence in different Musa species, includ-
ing the banana plants (M. acuminata and M. paradisiaca), in
which they have been demonstrated to be active as phytoalexins
(1-4) and nematicides (7), this is the first time that phenylphe-
nalenone compounds have been reported in abaca (M. textilis).
Banana plants (Musa sp., including M. textilis) are known to
be affected by different pathogenic fungi such as F. oxysporum
var. cubensis type 4 (casual agent of the Black Sigatoka disease)
or M. fijiensis (responsible for the so-called Panama disease).
Under colonization by these microorganisms, banana plants
produce phenylphenalenone type phytoalexins (1-4). Because
of their intense red or orange color, phenylphenalenones are
visually detectable in pigmented roots and rhizomes, which seem
to be the richest source of these natural products (4, 16, 24,
25), although they have also been detected in the leaves of some
Musa sp. infected with pathogenic fungi (8, 9). Therefore, after
the identification of phenylphenalenones in the abaca leaf fibers,
it seems reasonable to assume that there is a strong correlation
between the colored spots in abaca fibers and the presence of
Figure 2. Structures of the known phenylphenalenone type compounds
identified in the leaf fibers of abaca (M. textilis).

these compounds in this parts of the fibers. Moreover, the
presence of phenylphenalenones in the leaf fibers of abaca
studied here is strong evidence that they have been attacked by
these microorganisms and suffered from similar diseases as other
Musa species. These diseases can drastically reduce the produc-
tion of abaca fibers and also their quality. The presence of
phenylphenalenone compounds may therefore be used as a
parameter to assess the quality of the fiber.
