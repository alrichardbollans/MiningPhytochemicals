(Alston) and isolatedcompounds on acne vulgarisRicha Sharma1†, Navneet Kishore1†, Ahmed Hussein1,2† and Namrita Lall1*†AbstractBackground: Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disorder leading to inflammation as a result of the production ofreactive oxygen species due to the active involvement of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) in the infection site ofthe skin. The current study was designed to assess the potential of the leaf extract of Syzygium jambos L. (Alston)and its compounds for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity against the pathogenic P. acnes.Methods: The broth dilution method was used to assess the antibacterial activity. The cytotoxicity investigation onmouse melanocyte (B16-F10) and human leukemic monocyte lymphoma (U937) cells was done using sodium3’-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) reagent.The non-toxic concentrations of the samples was investigated for the suppression of cytokines interleukin 8 (IL 8)and tumour necrosis factor (TNF α) by testing the supernatants in the co-culture of the human U937 cells andheat killed P. acnes using enzyme immunoassay kits (ELISA). The statistical analysis was done using the Graph PadPrism 4 program.Results: Bioassay guided isolation of ethanol extract of the leaves of S. jambos led to the isolation of three knowncompounds namely; squalene, an anacardic acid analogue and ursolic acid which are reported for the first timefrom this plant. The ethanol extract of S. jambos and one of the isolated compound namely, anacardic acidanalogue were able to inhibit the growth of P. acnes with a noteworthy minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)value of 31.3 and 7.9 μg/ml, respectively. The ethanol extract and three commercially acquired compounds namely;myricetin, myricitrin, gallic acid exhibited significant antioxidant activity with fifty percent inhibitory concentration(IC50) ranging between 0.8-1.9 μg/ml which was comparable to that of vitamin C, the reference antioxidant agent.The plant extract, compounds ursolic acid and myricitrin (commercially acquired) significantly inhibited the releaseof inflammatory cytokines IL 8 and TNF α by suppressing them by 74 - 99%. TEM micrographs showed the lethaleffects of selected samples against P. acnes.Conclusions: The interesting antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of S. jambos shown in thepresent study warrant its further investigation in clinical studies for a possible alternative anti-acne agent.Keywords: Syzygium jambos, Propionibacterium acnes, Antibacterial, Interleukin 8, Tumour necrosis factor,Cytotoxicity, Transmission electron microscopy* Correspondence: Namrita.Lall@up.ac.za†Equal contributors1Department of Plant Science, Faculty of Agricultural and Biological Science,University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002 South AfricaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2013 Sharma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:292 Page 2 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/292BackgroundSyzygium jambos L. (Alston) belongs to the familyMyrtaceae and is commonly known as rose apple [1]which is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa [2], CentralAmerica and Asia [3]. The plant is reported to be usedfor a variety of ailments and is known for its antipyreticand anti-inflammatory properties. All parts of the plantare reported to have medicinal value. In Indo-China allparts of the plant are used for digestive and toothailments. A decoction of the leaves is used as a diuretic,a remedy for sore eyes and for rheumatism. The seedsare used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, diabetes and catarrh.A decoction of bark is administered to relieve asthma andbronchitis [1].Previous researchers who have investigated the planthave documented its potential pharmacological value.Acetone and aqueous bark extracts of this plant havebeen reported to be active against Staphylococcus aureus,Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylo-coccus cohnii and Staphylococcus warneri [4]. In anotherstudy, the scientists have investigated the antimicrobialactivity of both acetone and aqueous extracts of the leaves,bark and seeds against eight microorganisms namely, S.aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneu-moniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sal-monella typhi and Vibrio cholera. The acetone barkextract showed growth inhibitory activity against all themicroorganisms tested whereas, the leaf extract inhibitedonly S. aureus and the seed extract did not show anyinhibitory activity. The aqueous bark extract exhibitedgrowth inhibitory effect against S. aureus, E. coli and S.typhi, whereas, the seed extract inhibited the growth of P.aeruginosa and V. cholerae, and leaf extract exhibited aninhibitory effect only against S. typhi [5]. In a study doneby Kuiate et al. [6], it was found that the ethanol barkextract of S. jambos and its isolated triterpenoids such asfriedelin, β -amyrin acetate, betulinic acid and lupeolexhibited antidermatophytic activity against Microsporumaudouinii,Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophytonsoudanense.Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder ofthe pilosebaceous unit with multifactorial etiology. Itaffects almost everybody during the course of their life.There are four key processes in the pathogenesis of acne:1. Increased sebum production, 2. Follicular hyperke-ratinization which leads to follicular obstruction, 3.Colonization by the causative agent, Propionibacteriumacnes and 4. Host inflammatory responses triggered as aresults of bacterial infection [7,8].As a result of the increased sebum production due tohigh androgen levels, P. acnes, a gram positive anaerobiccommensal, produces various hydrolytic enzymes thatact on the sebum to release free fatty acids. These freefatty acids acts as chemokines and increase the releaseof pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukins 8 (IL 8)and tumour necrosis factors (TNF α) which attract mac-rophages and lead to severe inflammation. Follicular wallruptures due to the action of hydrolytic enzymes causeoxidative damage with the release of free radicals [7,8].Therefore, an agent that can inhibit the growth of P.acnes, scavenge free radicals and suppress the inflam-matory response is promising. The conventional drugsavailable to treat acne act as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents. But these drugs have various sideeffects such as dryness, itching and hypopigmentationand also have age restrictions. Moreover, bacterial resist-ance is an ongoing problem. The use of medicinal plantsdates back thousands of years. In light of previousreports regarding S. jambos as an antimicrobial agent ona variety of micro-organisms, the present study was con-ducted to explore its efficiency as an anti-acne agent.Thus, the antibacterial activity against P. acnes, the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of S. jambosand its compounds were investigated.MethodsChemicals, microbial strain and culture mediaSilica gel 60 (70–230 mesh); sephadex LH-20 and all theanalytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck SA Pty Ltd. Three chemical com-pounds namely, myricetin, myricitrin and gallic acidwere acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.The ELISA kits werebought from BD Biosciences, Johannesburg, South Africa.Cell proliferation Kit II (XTT) was supplied by Rochediagnostics Pty Ltd., Johannesburg, South Africa. Propioni-bacterium acnes (ATCC 11827) was purchased fromAnatech, Johannesburg, South Africa. The cell lines andmedium were purchased from Highveld Biological PtyLtd., Johannesburg, South Africa.Plant materialThe leaves of Syzygium jambos L. (Alston) were collectedin August 2010 from the botanical garden of the Univer-sity of Pretoria. The plant was identified at the H.G.W.JSchweicherdt Herbarium (University of Pretoria, Pretoria)where a voucher, specimen number (PRU 119053), hasbeen deposited for future reference.Extraction and purificationThe air-dried and powdered leaves (1.9 kg) of S. jamboswere soaked in 7.5 L ethanol for three days at roomtemperature. The crude ethanol extract (70.5 g) wasobtained by concentrating the filtrate under reduced pres-sure. About 60 g of this ethanol extract was applied to asilica gel column (70 cm × 120 cm) using hexane fractions(Hex): ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of increasing polarity (100:0to 0:100) followed by 100% methanol (MeOH) as eluents.In total forty three (43) fractions (500 ml) were collected.Sharma et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:292 Page 3 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/292Similar fractions were combined, according to the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) profiles, which resulted intwelve (12) major fractions (MF). All the twelve (12) majorfractions were tested for antibacterial activity against thepathogenic P. acnes using the broth dilution method. Theresults are listed in Table 1. The active MF (2, 4, and 6)were subjected to chromatographic separations to isolatethe individual components. MF 2 (200 mg) was applied toa silica gel column using Hex: EtOAc (100:0 to 0:100)gradient as eluents. Eighty five (85) fractions of 50 ml eachwere collected. The sub-fractions 9–13 were combined onthe basis of the TLC analysis which led to the isolation ofthe compound 1 (10 mg, 0.02%). MF 4 (600 mg) was sub-jected to a sephadex LH 20 column using 0.5% methanolin dichloromethane (DCM) as the eluent. One hundredand seventeen (117) fractions of 20 ml each were collec-ted. Sub-fractions 80–88 were combined which yieldedthe compound 2 (8 mg, 0.01%). MF 6 (1.4 g) was sub-jected to column chromatography similar to MF 4. Onehundred (100) fractions of 20 ml each were collected.Sub-fractions 39–56 were combined on the basis of theTLC profiles which yielded the compound 3 (56.5 mg,0.1%).The chemical structures of all the compounds areillustrated in Figure 1.Antibacterial activityThe ethanol extract and compounds were tested against P.acnes by determining the minimum inhibitory concentra-tion (MIC) values obtained by a microdilution method aspreviously described [9] with few modifications.

The 72 h culture of the bacteriawas dissolved in nutrient broth and the suspension wasadjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity. This re-sulted in 105-106 colony forming units (CFU)/ml. In asterile 96-well plate, 100 μl of samples from the stock so-lution consisting of the plant extract/isolated compounds(2 mg/ml in 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)) and thepositive control tetracycline (0.2 mg/ml) were diluted withbroth. Twofold serial dilutions were made in broth over arange to give concentrations of 500–3.9 μg/ml and 50–0.3and μg/ml for the plant extract/ isolated compounds andpositive control tetracycline, respectively. The bacterialsuspension (100 μl) was then added to the wells. The wellswith 2.5% DMSO and bacterial suspension without sam-ples served as the solvent and negative controls, res-pectively. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 72 h in ananaerobic environment. The MIC value was determined byobserving colour change in the wells after addition of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl (INT) (defined asthe lowest concentration that showed no bacterial growth).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)The TEM procedures followed the protocol of a previ-ous publication [10]. Briefly, bacteria was concentratedby centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 1 min. The pelletwas resuspended in nutrient broth to a final OD550 nmof 1.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:292 Page 4 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/292in order to visualise the lethal effects of tested samplesagainst bacteria. The bacterial suspension (5 ml) wasmixed with plant extract and pure compound to a finalconcentration of 300 and 100 μg/ml for plant extract and50 μg/ml for pure compound. Tetracycline (50 μg/ml) andDMSO (2.5%) were used as positive and solvent control,respectively. The pathogen was treated for 72 h; thecontrol group consisted of only bacterial suspension innutrient broth. Treated and untreated P. acnes cultureswere centrifuged and fixed in 2.5% glutraldehyde in phos-phate buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Samples werewashed with phosphate buffer and postfixed in both 1%osmium tetraoxide and uranyl acetate. The cells weredehydrated in ethanol and embedded in quetol resin. Thinsections were prepared with a microtome and micro-graphs were taken using a JEOL JEM-2100 F field emis-sion electron microscope.Antioxidant assayAntioxidant activity of the ethanol extract of S. jambosand compounds was investigated using 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant assay. Following theprocedures as described by DuToit et al. [11] for eachsample, a dilution series (8 dilutions) was prepared in a96 well plate by adding distilled water as a dilutionmedium. Final concentration of the samples ranged from100 to 0.7 μg/ml. Each concentration was tested intriplicate. Vitamin C was used as a positive control. Theradical scavenging capacities of the samples were deter-mined using a BIOTEK Power-wave XS multi wellreader (A.D.P., Weltevreden Park, South Africa) tomeasure the disappearance of DPPH at 550 nm. Theradical scavenging activity was measured in terms of theamount of antioxidants necessary to decrease the initialDPPH absorbance by 50% (IC50) [11]. The IC50 value ofeach sample was determined graphically by plotting theabsorbance of DPPH as a function of the sample con-centration in μg/ml. The IC50 is the amount of antioxi-dant necessary to decrease the initial DPPH absorbanceby 50%. The results are expressed as the mg vitamin Cequivalents/g dry weight and calculated as follows:VitEAC mg AA=100gð Þ ¼ IC50 vit cð Þ=IC50 sampleð Þð Þ 1000:In vitro cytotoxicity assayThe mouse melanocytes (B16-F10) cells were cultured ina complete Minimum Essential Eagle’s Medium (MEM)whereas the human U937 cells were cultured in RoswellPark Memorial Institute (RPMI) containing 10% fetalbovine serum (FBS) and 1% gentamycin. B16-F10 (105cells per well) and U937 (106 cells per well) were seededinto a 96-well plate. After an overnight incubation at 37°Cin 5% CO2 and a humidified atmosphere, the extract,compounds and the positive control (actinomycin D) wereadded to the cells. The final concentrations of plantextract and pure compounds ranged from 400–3.13 μg/mland 100–1.5 μg/ml, respectively. The highest concentra-tion of positive control (0.05 μg/ml) was serially diluted toeight consecutive wells. The plate was then incubated at37°C in 5% CO2, and a humidified atmosphere after whichthe toxic effects of the extracts were assayed using theXTT (sodium 3’-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetra-zolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid hy-drate) cytotoxicity assay. Fifty micro litres (50 μl) of XTTreagent (1 mg/ml XTT with 0.383 mg/ml PMS) was addedto the wells and incubated for 1 h. The optical densities ofthe wells were measured at 450 nm (690 nm referenceSharma et al.

By refer-ring to the control (medium with DMSO), the cell survivalrate was assessed. A statistical program (Graph Pad Prism4) was used to analyze the 50% inhibitory concentration(EC50) values.Preparation of heat-killed P. acnes and the measurementof cytokine productionThe effect of selected samples on cytokine production(IL 8 and TNF α) was evaluated using the respectiveenzyme immunoassay kits (ELISA) by a previously de-scribed method [12]. Briefly, the log phase culture of P.acnes was harvested, washed three times with phosphatebuffer saline (PBS), and incubated at 80°C for 30 min tokill the bacteria. The heat-killed bacteria were stored at4°C until use. The U937 cells were seeded at 106 cellsper well in a 24-well plate and was stimulated with heatkilled P. acnes (wet weight 100 μg/ml) alone and in com-bination with the different test samples. Pentoxifyllinewas used as a control. After 18 h incubation, the cell-free supernatants were collected and the concentrationsof IL 8 and TNF α were analysed. Cytokine standardswere serially diluted to facilitate the construction ofcalibration curves necessary for determining proteinconcentration after treatment with test samples. The ra-tio (%) of inhibition of the cytokine release was calcu-lated using the following equation:Inhibition %ð Þ ¼ 100  1–T=Cð ÞWhere T represents the concentration of the cytokinein the culture supernatant with the test sample, and Crepresents the concentration of cytokine in the culturesupernatant with the solvent [13].Statistical analysisAll the assays were performed in triplicate. IC50 andEC50 values for antioxidant and cytotoxicity tests werederived from a nonlinear regression model (curvefit)based on sigmoidal dose response curve (variable) andcomputed using GraphPad Prism 4 (Graphpad, SanDiego, CA, USA).Results and discussionsIdentification of isolated compoundsThe structure elucidation of the isolated compounds wasestablished on the basis of physical and spectroscopictechniques, especially NMR spectra and direct compa-rison with spectroscopic measurements to publishedliterature values. The compounds isolated from the etha-nol extract of leaves of S. jambos were identified as squa-lene (compound 1) [14] and ursolic acid (compound 3;white powder; m.p. 284–286°C) [15]. Compound 2 wasobtained as pale yellow liquid. The UV spectrum ofcompound 2 exhibited maximum absorption (λmax) at243 and 302 nm and in the IR spectrum showed absorp-tion bands at 3448 and 1617 cm-1 indicating the cha-racteristics of hydroxybenzoic acid [16]. The 1H NMRspectrum of compound 2 showed a triplet at δ 7.40(J = 8.2), and two doublets at 6.90 (J = 8.2), 6.80 (J = 7.2),and the characteristic signals for a 1, 2, 6-trisubstitutedbenzene ring. Additionally, the 13C NMR spectra showedthe signals at δ 176.3 (COOH), 163.5 (C-6), 147.7 (C-2),135.3 (C-4), 122.7 (C-3) 115.8 (C-1) and 110.3 (C-5), alsosupported the presence six carbons and a carboxylicgroup constituting the backbone, although a few signalsindicating the presence of long aliphatic chain could notbe established. There are many anacardic acids that havebeen reported by previous researchers which differ inthe length of side chain [17,18].Therefore, in the currentstudy compound 2 is being reported as anacardic acidanalogue with a side chain R. The ethanol leaves extractof S. jambos exhibited significant antibacterial activityagainst P. acnes; therefore, it was decided to acquirethree commercially known compounds namely; myrice-tin (yellow needles; m.p. 356–358°C), myricitrin (whitepowder; m.p. 206–208°C) and gallic acid (colourlesscrystals; m.p. 212–214°C) which have been previouslyisolated from 90% ethanol extract of S. jambos [19], toinvestigate if any of these compounds contribute to-wards the total extract activity. Also, the presence ofthese three commercially acquired compounds was con-firmed in ethanol extract of S. jambos prepared for thecurrent study by TLC.The present study reports the isolation of squalene,ursolic acid and an analogue of anacardic acid for thefirst time from S. jambos. The presence of the com-pounds discussed in this study is known since antiquity.Ursolic acid was first time reported in 1920 from epicu-ticular waxes of apple [20]. Squalene was first reportedin 1917 from shark liver oil by Mitsumaru Tsujimoto[21]. Myricetin and myricitrin were first isolated fromthe bark of Myrica nagi and subsequently were reportedin the leaves of Rhus coriaria, Myrica gale, Pistachia len-tiscus and Haematoxylon campeachianum [22,23]. Gallicacid was initially found in the nutgalls of Rhus toxico-dendron and later in the leaves of the same plant by M.Aschoff and M. Bracconnot in early 19th century [24].Anacardic acid was first reported from shells of cashewnuts by Stadler in 1847 [25].Antibacterial bioassayThe MIC value of the ethanol extract of S. jambos,twelve MF and compounds are listed in Table 1. Theethanol extract of S. jambos inhibited bacterial growthand exhibited a noteworthy MIC value of 31.3 μg/ml.Anacardic acid analogue was found to be the most activeSharma et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:292 Page 6 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/292compound against P. acnes at MIC value of 7.9 μg/ml ascompared to tetracycline (positive control) with MICvalue of 3.1 μg/ml. Compounds squalene, ursolic acid,myricetin, myricitrin and gallic acid did not show anyinhibitory activity at the highest concentration tested(500 μg/ml).To the best of our knowledge, the antibacterial activityof S. jambos and the compounds (squalene, ursolic acid,myricetin, myricitrin and gallic acid) against P. acnes isreported for the first time. In the present study anacar-dic acid analogue significantly inhibited the growth of P.acnes. Our results corroborate well with previous inves-tigations where reports regarding antibacterial activity ofa series of synthetic anacardic acids possessing differentside-chain lengths against P. acnes were found. Fouranacardic acids namely; pentadecatrienyl salicylic acid,pentadecadienyl salicylic acid, pentadecenyl salicylic acidand pentadecyl salicylic acid were reported to be activeagainst P. acnes with MIC value of 0.78 μg/ml, very simi-lar to our results [18]. In another study, ursolic acidshowed MIC value of 4 μg/ml against vancomycin-resistant enterococci [26], myricetin inhibited the growthof methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Burkholderia cepaciaand K. pneumoniae [27], different strains of Staphylococ-cus epidermidis exhibited sensitivity towards myricitrin[28] and gallic acid showed growth inhibitory behaviouron S. aurens, Bacillus cereus, E. coli and Candida albi-cans [29]. No scientific report on the antimicrobial activ-ity of squalene was found in the literature.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)For the microscopy studies, the plant extract and iso-lated compound anacardic acid analogue, which showedinhibitory activity against the bacteria, were selected.The TEM micrograph showed clear differences betweenuntreated and treated P. acnes. The untreated P. acneshad a distinct cell wall which was long, spindle shaped,smooth and lined with cell membrane. A centrally lo-cated nucleoid surrounded by ribosomes was observed(Figure 2a). The TEM micrograph shows cell injurycaused to P. acnes after treatment with ethanol extractof S. jambos for 72 h. P. acnes showed breaks in the cellwall when treated with the ethanol extract of S. jambosat 100 μg/ml (Figure 2b) while a complete loss of cellwall was also observed at a higher concentration of300 μg/ml (Figure 2c).The TEM micrographs of P. acnestreated with anacardic acid analogue at a concentrationof 50 μg/ml showed abnormal changes in cell contentmaterial such as shrinkage of intracellular inclusions andthe hollow appearance of the bacteria. The outer mem-brane was found to be irregular and distortions in thecell structure were observed (Figure 2d). Tetracycline ata concentration of 50 μg/ml caused significant damagesto the cells of P. acnes, leading to damages in the cellmembrane, distortion in the cell structure and shrinkageof cell content material (Figure 2e). DMSO at 2.5%exhibited no lethal effects to bacteria (Figure 2f). TheTEM micrograph confirms the antibacterial activity of S.jambos and bioactive compound (anacardic acid analogue)against P. acnes.Antioxidant properties of S. jambos and its compoundsThe DPPH assay indicated the free radical scavengingproperties of the samples. Antioxidants are able to stabi-lize the free DPPH radicals due to their proton donatingability. The scavenging effect of the ethanol extract of S.jambos and the compounds (myricetin, myricitrin andgallic acid) on DPPH increased with increasing concentra-tions. These samples showed significant antioxidant activ-ity with IC50 values ranging between 1.9-0.7 μg/ml, verysimilar to that of Vitamin C, a widely used antioxidantcompound exhibiting an IC50 value of 1.9 μg/ml. The iso-lated compounds (squalene, anacardic acid analogue andursolic acid) did not exhibit any radical scavenging activityat highest concentration tested (100 μg/ml). The resultsare summarised in Table 1. Our findings were in agree-ment with previous reports. The DPPH radical scavengingactivity of S. jambos has been reported previously withIC50 value of 14.10 μg/ml [30] and can be explained dueto the presence of flavonoids and polyphenol compoundsnamely; myricetin, myricitrin and gallic acid. The antioxi-dant activity of flavonoids and polyphenols is ascribed tothe presence of free hydroxyl (−OH) substitutes. Myricetinpossess six free hydroxyl radicals at 3, 5, 7, 3΄, 4΄, 5΄ car-bon positions and gallic acid possess three free hydroxylradicals at 3, 4, 5 carbon positions. In the current study,ursolic acid did not demonstrate any antioxidant activityeven at its highest concentration of 100 μg/ml. Similar toour findings, another researcher found ursolic acid to beinactive in inhibiting the generation of free radicals atconcentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml [31]. In our studysqualene did not show any DPPH free radical sca-venging activity and this can be explained as it is a sin-gle oxygen scavenger and lacks free hydroxyl groups,therefore cannot scavenge a DPPH radical [32]. In thecurrent study, no antioxidant activity for anacardic acidanalogue was found. Similar to our findings, 6-pentade-cenylsalicylic acid isolated from Anacardium occiden-tale did not exhibit notable DPPH radical scavengingactivity [33].Effect of ethanol extract of S. jambos and its compoundson the cell viabilityThe cytotoxicity assay of the extracts and the com-pounds was done on B16-F10 mouse melanocyte andU937 human macrophage cells. Due to the low yield, nofurther test could be done on the isolated compoundanacardic acid analogue. All the results are listed inFigure 2 Transmission electron micrograph of a thin section of P. acnes at 60 K magnification.

To the best of our knowledge, the cytotoxicityresults of ethanol extract of S. jambos and the com-pounds (squalene, ursolic acid, myricetin, myricitrin andgallic acid) on the cell viability of B16-F10 and U937cells obtained in the present study are reported for thefirst time. S. jambos exhibited moderate toxicity to B16-F10 cells and no toxicity to U937 cells. In contrary, pre-vious studies have reported strong cytotoxic effects of70% acetone extract of S. jambos on human leukemiacells (HL-60) with an IC50 value of 10.2 μg/ml [34]. Inthe current study, squalene was not found to be toxic onboth the cell lines with 100% viability of cells even athighest concentration of 100 μg/ml tested. Similar toour findings, squalene was reported to be non-toxic tohuman mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) [35]. In thepresent study, ursolic acid was found to be moderatelytoxic to U937 cells. Contrary to our findings, in a study,significant cytotoxic effects of ursolic acid againstlymphocytic leukemia cells (P 388 and L 1210), humancolon cells (HCT 8) and mammary (MCF 7) tumourcells were reported [36]. Myricetin and gallic acidshowed significant toxicity to B16-F10 cells and moder-ate toxicity on U937 cells. Similar to our results, myrice-tin showed strong toxicity to human A549 lung cells[37] and gallic acid was not reported to be toxic onhuman lymphocytes derived from fresh blood [38]. Inour study myricitrin did not show any toxicity to eitherof the cell lines and similar results are reported in astudy where myricitrin was not found to be toxic onmurine fibro sarcoma (L929) cells [39].Sharma et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:292 Page 8 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/292Effect of ethanol extract of S. jambos and its compoundson the pro-inflammatory cytokinesP. acnes contribute to the inflammatory nature of acneby inducing macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatorycytokines like IL 8 and TNF α. In the current study,U937 cells treated with heat-killed P. acnes resulted inan increase in secretion of IL 8 and TNF α (data notshown). These results confirmed that P. acnes are capablein eliciting the inflammatory response which plays animportant role in acne pathogenesis.For the interpretation of the results, the percentagevalues are classified under four groups; an inhibition be-tween 100 and 70% was accepted as high, between 69 and40% as moderate, between 39 and 20% as low. An inhib-ition of less than 20% was considered to be insignificant.To test the anti-inflammatory effects of S. jambos andits compounds, in vitro screening at three non-cytotoxicconcentrations of the samples to the cells were applied.As shown in Table 2, the ethanol extract of S. jambosand the compounds (ursolic acid, myricetin, myricitrinand gallic acid) decreased the production of IL 8 andTNF α in a dose-dependent manner. A significant inhib-ition of IL 8 and TNF α was observed for the S. jambosextract, ursolic acid and myricitrin at their highest con-centrations. Gallic acid, although suppressed TNF αdrastically, had no significant suppression of IL 8 at itshighest concentration. Myricetin moderately decreasedTable 2 Anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extract ofSyzygium jambos and the compoundsTest samples Final concentrationμg/ml/(μM)Inhibitory ratio (%)IL 8 TNF αSyzygium jambos 100 85.0 99.750 69.8 79.910 23.9 28.6Ursolic acid 25/(54) 88.3 74.012.5/(27) 78.9 59.86.2/(13) 53.2 14.0Myricetin 12.5/(39) 34 44.16.2/(19) 10 27.13.1/(9) −0.5 −4.8Myricitrin 100/(215) 99.6 99.750/(107) 94.3 99.710/(21) 40.6 32.8Gallic acid 25/(146) 29.9 84.912.5/(73) 19.5 68.06.2/(36) 7.6 20.1Pentoxifylline 100/(359) −1.3 99.750/(179) −5.0 99.710/(35) −0.16 66.8the release of TNF α and showed low inhibition of IL 8at the highest concentration tested. Pentoxifylline, whichwas used as a control, behaved differently on the cyto-kines. Based on previous reports, it down regulated thesecretion of TNF α and caused no change in the IL 8 re-leased [40]. As shown in Table 2, our results corroboratewell with previous investigations. Very high inhibition ofTNF α was observed at 100 and 50 μg/ml of pentoxifyl-line whereas no significant change in IL 8 concentrationwas observed. Furthermore, the test samples did notincrease the secretion of the cytokines in the culture ofU937 cells in the absence of the heat killed P. acnes(data not shown). Other researchers have previously re-ported the anti-inflammatory potential of the samplesisolated in this study. Myricetin was reported to inhibitthe release of IL 8 and TNF α from human umbilicalcord blood-derived cultured mast cells [41], myricitrinand myricetin suppressed TNF α production in LPS/IFN-γ stimulated J774.A1 cell line [42]. Gallic acid inhib-ited the production of IL 8 and TNF α from Fusobacter-ium nucleatum activated human mouth epithelial cellline and human mast cells, respectively [43,44]. Ursolicacid inhibited IL 8 secretion from HT29 cells [45]. Tothe best of our knowledge, no reports about S. jambos incontext with suppression of cytokines were found. Al-though, similar to our results, other plants such asEucommia ulmoides and Ilex paraguariensis extractswere reported to reduce the secretion of IL 8 and TNF αin human monocytic THP-1 cells pre-treated with P.acnes at concentration of 0.1 mg/ml [12].The anti-inflammatory activity and release of cytokineslike IL 8 and TNF α is linked with an inflammatorymediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). NF-κB is a tran-scription factor that resides in the cytoplasm of every celland its constitutive activation is linked with P. acnes infec-tion. The suppression of the cytokines discussed in thisstudy can possibly be due to blocking activation of com-mon transcription factor such as NF-κB involved in theirinduction.ConclusionThe present study provided an important insight on theplants and compounds to be promising source of alter-native medicine. Effective anti-acne agents possess threeessential capabilities of antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The experimental data gatheredherein shows significant antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the ethanol extract of S. jamboswhich might be due to the synergistic action of compoundspresent in it. Additionally, the plant extract was not foundto be toxic to human cells. Therefore, S. jambos could bean ideal concomitant for an alternative anti-acne agent.This study will be helpful to understand this importantherbal medicine and further clinical trials are under way.Sharma et al.
