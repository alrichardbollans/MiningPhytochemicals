A investigação fitoquímica das raízes de Raulinoa echinata, planta endêmica do Vale do Itajaí/
SC, levou ao isolamento e identificação dos limonóides degradados: fraxinelona, fraxinelonona e
epoxi-fraxinelona. O último foi anteriormente isolado dos caules, porém sua configuração relativa
não foi resolvida por experimentos de RMN. Este trabalho apresenta a análise de difração de
raios-X da epoxi-fraxinelona, descreve o isolamento da fraxinelonona e fraxinelona pela primeira
vez em Raulinoa, e a atividade tóxica da primeira sobre formigas cortadeiras (Atta sexdens
rubropilosa). Pouca atividade foi observada para o limonóide degradado testado; entretanto, o
limonóide ácido limonéxico isolado dos caules, apresentou alta toxicidade contra as formigas
cortadeiras, reduzindo consideravelmente a longevidade das mesmas, em comparação com o controle.
Phytochemical survey of roots extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plant Raulinoa echinata
Cowan, Rutaceae led to the isolation of known degraded limonoids: fraxinellone, fraxinellonone and
epoxy-fraxinellone. The latter was previously isolated also from the stems, but the relative configuration
could not be solved by NMR experiments. This paper deals with the X-ray diffraction analysis of
epoxy-fraxinellone and its toxicity to leaf-cutting ants, describes the isolation of fraxinellonone and
fraxinellone for the first time in Raulinoa. Epoxy-fraxinellone showed no toxicity to the leaf-cutting
ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). The limonoid limonexic acid, isolated from stems, presented high
toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants, diminishing considerably their longevity.

Introduction
Raulinoa is a monospecific genus and the species
Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic in the
Itajaí Valley, SC, Brazil.1 This endangered perennial woody
shrub is characterized by the presence of spines (popularly
know as Cutia-de-espinho) and has only been found in a
short interval (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks
of Itajaí river in an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing
a high degree of adaptation to the environment.
We have previously reported the isolation and
biological activities of some compounds of R. echinata.2
In continuation of our search for compounds and natural
products to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants, we
have investigated the hexane extracts of roots of R. echinata
leading to the isolation of typical rutaceous degraded
limonoids: fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2) and new
epoxy-fraxinellone (3). The extracts of the stems furnished
the known limonin precursor, limonexic acid (4).
Leaf-cutting ants are one of the most serious agricultural
pests in South American countries and the biological control
of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Their control
can be achieved by means of intoxicating the leaf-cutting
ants3 or inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus.
In this paper we describe the isolation, structural
determination and evaluation of the activity of degraded
1444 Biavatti et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
limonoids and limonoids as toxicants to the leaf-cutting
ants Atta sexdens rubropilosa.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
NMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer,
operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C
was used.2 All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS as
internal standard.
Single crystal X-ray analysis
Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was
performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD
diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid
N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation
(0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 52.7° in 2θ, with a
redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based
on all reflections. Data collections were made using the
COLLECT program;4 integration and scaling of the
reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack
system of programs.5 No absorption corrections were
applied.
The structure was solved by direct methods with
SHELXS-97.6 The model was refined by full-matrix least
squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.7 All the hydrogen atoms
were set isotropic and freely refined. Data collections and
experimental details for the complexes are summarized in
Table 1. The programs SHELXL-97,7 and ORTEP-38 were
used within WinGX9 to prepare materials for publication.
Data collections and experimental details for compound 3
are summarized in Table 1.
Plant material
Roots of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada,
Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universidade
Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade
de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti
2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbário Barbosa
Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation of compounds
The dried and powdered roots (397 g) were extracted
with hexane (4 g) and MeOH (20 g). Successively, the
hexane extract was fractionated over silica gel 60 (70-230
mesh) into three fractions: hexane, EtOAc and MeOH. The
hexane sub-fraction (576 mg) was chromatographed over
silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc
(9:1 and gradient) to furnish the compounds (in eluting
order): fraxinellone (1) (37.1 mg), epoxy-fraxinellone (3)
(76 mg), and the fraction named E (30 mg), that was
rechromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using
as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (99:1 and gradient) to afford
fraxinellonone (2) (6 mg).
The methanol extract of the stems (80 g) was partitioned
with dichloromethane (yielding 9 g) then chromatographed
over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone
(9:1 and gradient), furnishing 17 sub-fractions (A-P). Sub-
fractions D-G (4.1 g) were grouped and chromatographed
over silica gel and hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient) as
eluent, originating sub-fractions A-T. The sub-fraction T
(1.2 g) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-
benzene (1:1), yielding 650 mg of limonexic acid (4).
Identification of the isolated compounds
The isolated degraded limonoids fraxinellone10,11,12 (1),
fraxinellonone10,11,12 (2), epoxy-fraxinellone13 (3) and
limonexic acid13 (4) presented spectral data in agreement
with the literature.

Atta sexdens bioassay
The toxicity of the compounds to Atta sexdens
rubropilosa was determined by ingestion bioassay,
according to established protocol described in Bueno et
al. (1997).14
Each treatment consisted of 50 ants distributed in 5 Petri
dishes. The leaf-cutting ants were isolated from their nest
and fed with an artificial diet. The ants from the treatment
received a diet added with epoxy-fraxinellone or limonexic
acid, at a concentration of 200 μg. The ants from the control
treatment were fed with a diet without this compound.
During 25 days, the number of dead ants for each Petri
dish was counted and a new portion of artificial diet given. It
was estimated the survival curve of leaf-cutting ants of each
treatment and calculated the median longevity. The test used
for the statistic analyze of data was the Log rank-test (α=0.05).
Results and Discussion
The isolated degraded limonoids 1-3 were respectively
identified as fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2), epoxy-
fraxinellone (3) and limonexic acid (4) by comparison with
the spectral data described in the literature.10-13
Epoxy-fraxinellone has a quaternary epoxy group
attached to C8-C14, instead of the double bond as in
fraxinellone. The spectroscopic data published13 could not
furnish clear evidence of the spatial configuration of this
moiety. In an attempt to confirm the epoxy group position,
nOe difference experiments were performed, but the
defining signals were superimposed (in d-chloroform and
benzene-d6), frustrating clear conclusions. In order to solve
these indistinguishable findings, an X-ray analysis (Figure
1) was performed to confirm the epoxy group position.
Single crystal of epoxy-fraxinellone was produced by
recrystallization followed by a crystal-growing process.
The recrystallization involved dissolution of the material
in proper amount of ethyl acetate-acetone followed by
drops of water. Suitable crystals were selected and analysed
by single crystal X-ray diffraction which established
undoubtedly the structure of the compound 3. Figure 1
shows an Ortep8 type view of 3 showing the thermal
ellipsoids and atoms labels. This study shows that the
molecular conformation of 3 is fixed by the presence of
three main intramolecular interactions (Table 2). The
analyses of the crystal packing showed the presence of
others three intermolecular interactions in 3 (Table 3).
These interactions give rise to the formation of infinite
chains along the c axis (Figure 2). All geometrical details
of the intermolecular contacts were interpreted as

intermolecular interactions on geometrical grounds,15 and
the Table 2 show their selected geometrical parameters.
The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated
on the basis of 1H NMR and EIMS spectra, and were in
agreement with published data.10-12 The EI-mass spectra of
both compounds shown to be formed mainly from the
molecular ion by the consecutive exclusion of furan-3-
aldehyde, CH3, HCHO and CO fragments.
As previously reported, crude extracts of leaves and
stems as well as fractions of R. echinata showed good
inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth, the fungus
cultured by the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa.16
Epoxy-fraxinellone showed not be toxic to the leaf-
cutting ants, although limonexic acid displayed a
significant reduction on lifetime (11 days) of leaf cutting
ants, when compared with the control group (22 days)
(Figure 3).
Limonexic acid was also isolated from Dictamnus
angustifolius17 a traditional plant used in China and from
Tetradium trichotomum18 root barks, and together with
isolimonexic acid are the main constituents of the fruit of
Citrus nippokoreana.19 Despite being known since 1948,20
no significant reference of its bioactivity was found.
Just a dozen degraded limonoids have been published,
mainly from Rutaceae and Meliaceae plants. As the parent
limonoids, some of them have been tested for biological
activities including antifeeding and growth regulating
activities against insects, and some relationship between
the structures and biological activity has been studied.11

In roots they were also found in Melia azedarach21 and
Dictamnus dasycarpus.12
Ichthyotoxic and insect antifeedant activities have
been described for fraxinellone and fraxinellonone against
Oryzias latipes and Spodoptera littoralis respectively.10
Antifertility, antiplatelet aggregation and vasorelaxant
activities are also described for fraxinellone, that also
reduced the growth rate and food consumption of both
adults and larvae of Tribolium castaneum at concentration
of 10 ppm and above in a concentration dependent manner,
but was less active than commercial feeding deterrents.12
