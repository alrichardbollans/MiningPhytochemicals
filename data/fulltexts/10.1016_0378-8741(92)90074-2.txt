The stem barks of Pera benensis are employed by the Chimane Indians in the Bolivian Amazonia as treatment of cutaneous 
leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan Leishmania braziliensis. The chloroform extracts containing quinones were found active against 
the promastigote forms of Leishmania and the epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi at 10 pg ml-I. The activity guided fractiona- 
tion of the extract by chromatography afforded active compounds. Their structures were elucidated, by spectral and chemical studies, 
as known naphthoquinones, plumbagin, 3,3 '-biplumbagin, 8-8 '-biplumbagin, and-triterpene, lupeol. The activity in vitro of each 
compound was evaluated against 5 strains of Leishmania (promastigote), 6 strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (epimastigote) and the in- 
tracellular form (amastigote) of Leidim The baseline drugs used were Glucantime and pentamidine (Leishmania

Introduction 
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an endemic disease 
in South America, particularly in the tropical 
subandean regions of Bolivia. Leishmaniasis is in- 
itiated by inoculation of Leishnania species into 
the skin during sandfly bites. Cutaneous disease 
typically presents as a papule that enlarges over 
weeks to months to form a shallow ulcer with rais- 
ed red margins and that is thought to ultimately 
self-heal with scarring in months to years (Saenz et 
al., 1990). The cutaneous and mucosal 
leishmaniasis caused by the parasite Leishmania 
braziliensis are common infections in the sub- 
tropical regions of the Yungas, Alto-Beni (Depart- 
ment of La Paz) and the foothills of the Andes 
(Department of Beni) where the Chimane Indians 
live. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is popularly known 
as espundia in this region of Bolivia called Oriente 
by the natives. The infection is classically treated 
with pentavalent antimony in the form of sodium

stibogluconate (Pentostam@) or N-methylglucam- 
ine antimonate (Glucantime@) and with pen- 
tamidine or amphotericin B (Berman, 1988). These 
drugs are parenteral, potentially or frankly toxic 
and generally administered in a hospitalized set- 
ting., In the endemic regions, these treatments are 
tao expensive or unavailable to the population suf- 
fering from espundia. The impact of this disease 
was developed by the colonization of sudandean 
tropical regions of the Departments of La Paz, 
Beni and Cochabamba by the highlanders. The use 
of medicinal plants is quite widespread, specially 
in the Chimanes Indians, a lowland group 
numbering about 5000 who inhabit the gallery 
forest and sandbars of the Rio Maniqui and its 
affluents. 
The Instituto Boliviano de Biologia de Altura 
(IBBA) and ORSTOM (French Institute of Scien- 
tific Research for the Development in Coopera- 
tion) have initiated investigations in the endemic 
regions of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We have col- 
lected and studied many medicinal plants 
(Fournet, in preparation) and more specially a 
tree, called apaiiiiki by the Chimane Indians, used 
for the specific treatment of cutaneous leishman-

iasis (espundia) and identified as Pcrti henensis 
Rusby (Euphorbiaceae). The Chimane Indians use 
a preparation containing only the yellow fresh 
stem barks of this 15-20 m tall tree for curing the 
cutaneous lesion topically. In a preliminary screen- 
ing. quinonic extracts of stem barks or root barks 
of Peru henerisis displayed activity in vitro at a 
concentration of 10 pg ml-’ against three strains 
of promastigote forms of Leishnianiri species, L. 
brudiensis, L. uniuzonensis and L. donom”, and 
three strains of an other Trqpanosomatidae, 
Trypunosoniu cruzi, responsible for Chagas dis- 
ease. Activity-directed fractionation and purifica- 
tion gave three active compounds. identified by 
their physical and spectral data. 
This work is devoted to the isolation. the 
chemical identification and the antileishmanial 
and trypanocidal activities of the active com- 
pounds. 
Materials and Methods 
Isolution und cheniistrj 
General experimental procedures. UV spectra 
were recorded on a Unicam SP 1800 spec- 
trophotometer. IR spectra were measured in KBr 
with a Perkin Elmer 257. All ‘H- and ‘jC-NMR 
spectra were recorded in CDCI, (6 ppm) on a 
Bruker AC 200 P spectrometer operating at 200 
and 50 MHz, respectively. ELMS spectra were ob- 
tained on a Nermag R 1010 C mass spectrometer 
operating at 70 eV. GLC analyses were performed 
on a Hewlett Packdrd HP 5890 A equipped with a 
25 m x 0.2 mm i.d. open HPI column (0.33 pm 
film thickness). The temperature for the analyses 
was programmed from 200” to 330” at 4”/min. Si 
gel GFz54 and Si gel 60 N (Merck) were used for 
TLC and CC. respectively. Naphthoquinones were 
detected by spraying ethanolic solution containing 
5% KOH. 
Plunt ntuteriul 
Stem barks (4.5 kg) and root barks (1.2 kg) of 
Peru henensis Rusby were collected by A. Fournet 
(A.F. 846) in October 1989, at Fatima de Chimane, 
in the Department of Beni, altitude 450 m, Bolivia. 
The plant material has been identified by S. Beck 
of the National Herbarium of Bolivia, La Paz. 
Voucher specimens are deposited in the National 
Herbarium of Bolivia (La Paz).

cultures were washed with medium without serum 
until less than one free parasite per 10 macro- 
phages. The rate of infection was checked by fixing 
and staining infected macrophages with May- 
Griindwald-Giemsa. Twenty-four hours after in- 
fection, culture medium was replaced by fresh 
medium either alone (control culture) or contain- 
ing drugs at different concentrations. Glucantime@

quots were taken every day, parasites counted in a 
hemacytometer and the counts compared with 
those of controls grown without drug. Nifurtimox 
(Bayer, Germany) and benznidazole (Roche, 
USA) were used for comparison. 
Results 
The stem and root bark extracts of Pera betiensis 
showed a significant activity on promastigote 
forms of Leishmania spp. and epimastigote forms 
of Trypanosoma cruzi. The fractionation and 
purification monitored by bioassay led to isolation 
of three active compounds identified by spectral 
data to the known naphthoquinones plumbagin 
(I), 3,3 ’-biplumbagin (2) and 8,8 ’-biplumbagin (3) 
(see Fig. 2). Plumbagin (1) and 8,8’-biplumbagin 
(3) are the most potent compounds with a ICyo of 
5 pg ml-’ on the three strains of Leishmania (see 
Table 1). This antileishmanial activity was con- 
firmed on the intracellular forms (amastigotes) of 
Leishmania amazonensis by plumbagin (l), in- 
hibiting 16.5% of the parasites in the host cells at 
a concentration of 10 pg ml-’ (see Table 2). Plum- 
bagin presented a ICyo of 5 pg ml-’ on the six 
strains of epimastigote forms of Trypaiiosoma 
cruzi. 3,3 “Biplumbagin (2) and 8,s ’-biplumbagin 
(3) were weakly active against T. cruzi, their ICyo 
varied widely (Table 3). The trypanocidal activity 
of plumbagin (1) was confirmed on biological tests 
on trypomastigotes, the blood circulating forms of 
T. cruzi (Rojas de Arias et al., 1990). Lupeol, an 
abundant compound in stems of Pera benensis, 
showed a weak activity against these parasites.

strated. Active compounds against Leisiininniii 
have been identified to plumbagin and two bis- 
naphthoquinones. 3.3 '-biplumbagin and 8.8 '- 
biplumbagin. In the literature. plumbagin was 
described active against Leishriirinili i i i i ~ ~ i r ~ i ~ ~ i ~ ~ i . ~  
and L. doriovt?izi (Docampo and Moreno, 1984; 
Croft et al., 1985); a bis-naphthoquinone isolated 
from the Indian plant Diosp~~ros " v i m i .  
diospyrine, a dimer of 7-methyljuglone. is also ac- 
tive in vitro against L. doiicwani (Hazra et al.. 
1987). Some naphthoquinones have been reported 
as active against Trypuiiosomlr criri (Pinto et al.. 
i987: Carvaiho er ai.. 1988). Gur results cor- 
roborate the study of Neal and Croft in 1984 
showing the effectivity in vitro and in vilo of com- 
pounds such as naphthoquinones generating free 
radicals. The use of topical application of 
naphthoquinones in skin diseases is described in 
the literature (Sofowora. 1983; Gujar. 1990). 
These ethnopharniacological. biological and 
chemical studies showed that application of stem 
barks of upuïñiki is really effecthe againht the in- 
fection by Leishnianicr brtrrilieiisis. The choice of 
Perrz benensis as an antileishmanial plant bi  
Chimane Indians is probablx due to numerous em- 
pirical assays. This tree of 15-10 ni tall is rare in 
the subandean rain forest of the Beni: it was the 
second identification of Pscr heiicrisis in Bolî\ ia 
after the description of the type hy R u b i  ( 1910). 
The Chimane Indians never ube the stem barks of 
Peru beiiciisis as a decoction or infusion against 
espuiiíliti, because they sap that such preparations 
are too toxic. They use cataplasms of fresh htems 
directly on the lesion until the complete healing of 
wound. The applications gi\e an inflammation of 
the lesion \\hich disappears ~ louly .  The bright 
black seeds of Pcrrr EciieiisiLs are used as a game b j  
the Chimane children. 
In conclusion. the present study has demon- 
strated that Pera hencrzsis, a medicinal plant used 
in folh medicine. is efficient to treat cutaneoub 
leishmaniasis. If this plant is not toxic in human 
medicine. it can be a safe and cheap altrrnative in 
the endemic rural regions without health centres 
where drugs are not akailable. This work on nn- 
tileishmanial activity of Perti Pc~ii~~izsis chould be 
validated with in vivo studies on BALBT niice in- 
fected by a strain of the cutaneous leishmaniasis of 
the New World and treated with the naphtho- 
quinones.
