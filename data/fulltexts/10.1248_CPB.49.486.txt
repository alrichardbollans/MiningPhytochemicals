In the course of our chemical study on tannins, cercidininA had been isolated from the bark of Cercidiphyllum japon-icum SIEB. et ZUCC. (Cercidiphyllaceae) and characterized as1,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-2,3-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-b-D-glucose (19).3) Recently, Khanbabaee and Lötzerich syn-thesized the 1,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-2,3-(R)-HHDP-b-D-glucoseand pointed out that the NMR data of the product were notidentical to those reported for cercidinin A.4) This paperdeals with reexamination and revision of the structure of cer-cidinin A and the significance of this compound as the firstellagitannin possessing a hexahydroxydiphenoyl group at the3,4-position of glucose, from the viewpoint of biogenesis ofellagitannins.Results and DiscussionIn the previous work,3) cercidinin A was characterized byone-dimensional 1H- and 13C-NMR analysis and chemicalexamination. Methylation, followed by methanolysis, yielded(R)-dimethyl hexamethoxydiphenate ([a]D 127.1°) andmethyl trimethoxybenzoate, unequivocally indicating thepresence of a (R)-HHDP and galloyl groups in the molecule.Presence of a glucose core was verified by acid hydrolysis.The location of the esters on the glucopyranose was deducedfrom the result of selective hydrolysis of galloyl groups withtannase. Because of low resolution of the 1H-NMR spectra(100 MHz) in those days, complete assignment of the sugarproton signals of the hydrolysate, an anomer mixture of theHHDP-glucose, could not be achieved. However, complexsignal patterns observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum resembledthat of 2,3-(S )-HHDP glucose.In the present work, we first measured the 1H–1H corre-lated spectroscopy (1H–1H COSY) and the heteronuclear sin-gle quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of cercidinin Aand made complete assignment for the proton and carbonsignals arising from the glucose moiety. In the heteronuclearmultiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum, signals attrib-utable to glucose H-3 (d 5.63, dd, J58.8, 10.1 Hz) and H-4(d 5.36, dd, J58.8, 10.1 Hz) were correlated with the estercarboxyl signals at d 169.1 and 168.7, respectively. The estercarbons, in turn, coupled with the proton signals at d 6.47and d 6.71 (each 1H, s), which were attributable to the aro-matic protons of the HHDP group. Furthermore, the remain-ing carboxyl carbons of three galloyl groups, resonated at d165.0, 165.9, and 166.5, were coupled with the glucose H-1(d 6.28, d, J58.1 Hz), H-2 (d 5.58, dd, J58.1, 10.1 Hz) andH-6 (d 4.69, br d, J510.8 Hz, d 4.54, dd, J54.2, 10.8 Hz),respectively. These HMBC correlations unambiguously clari-fied the location of the (R)-HHDP esters at the C-3 and C-4positions of the glucose core. The 500 MHz 1H-NMR signalsof the tannase hydrolysate, 3,4-(R)-HHDP-glucose (1a), werealso completely assigned, and a large low field shift of thesignals, attributable to the glucose H-3 and H-4, confirmedthe above conclusion (see Experimental). On the basis ofthese results, the structure of cercidinin A was revised asshown in formula 1. Cercidinin B,3) which had been charac-terized as 1-desgalloylcercidinin A, was also revised to 2,6-di-O-galloyl-3,4-(R)-HHDP-D-glucopyranose.The 1H-NMR coupling constant between H-3 and H-4(8.8 Hz) of 1 was slightly smaller than that observed for nor-mal 4C1 glucopyranose (J2,35J3,45J4,559—10 Hz), suggest-ing that this glucose possessed a modified 4C1 conformation.In addition, the coupling patterns of the pyranose ring pro-tons of 1a indicated that the pyranose conformation of the a-form (J2,3510.3 Hz, J3,459.4 Hz, J4,5510.5 Hz) was slightlydifferent from that of the b-form, taking 4C1 conformation(J2,35J3,45J4,559.7 Hz).∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: ikouno@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp © 2001 Pharmaceutical Society of JapanRevised Structure of Cercidinin A, a Novel Ellagitannin Having (R)-Hexahydroxydiphenoyl Esters at the 3,4-Positions of GlucopyranoseTakashi TANAKA,a Gen-ichiro NONAKA,b,1) Makoto ISHIMATSU,b,2) Itsuo NISHIOKA,b and Isao KOUNO*,aSchool of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University,a 1–14 Bunkyo-machi, Nagasaki 852–8521, Japan and Faculty ofPharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University,b 3–1–1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812–8582, Japan.Received October 30, 2000; accepted December 9, 2000The structue of cercidinin A, an ellagitannin isolated from the bark of Cercidiphyllum japonicum, was re-vised to 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-3,4-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-b-D-glucose by two-dimensional NMR spectral analy-sis.

Pharm. Bull. 49(4) 486—487 (2001) Vol. 49, No. 4Most monomeric ellagitannins are structurally and bio-genetically classified into two groups.5) Tannins, belonging tothe first group (group A), have the 4C1 glucopyranose core,and usually the (S )-HHDP esters are located at the 2,3-posi-tions and/or 4,6-positions of the pyranose ring. C-Glycosidicellagitannins, having an open-chain glucose core, are alsobiogenetically related to this group.6) Tannins, belonging tothe other group (group B), possess the glucose core with 1C4or related boat conformation. In these ellagitannins, (R)- or(S )-HHDP esters (or its oxidized form, dehydrohexahydroxy-diphenoyl esters) are attached to the 1,6-; 1,3-; 2,4-; or 3,6-positions of the pyranose ring.7) Cercidinin A belongs to thegroup A because it possesses a modified 4C1-glucopyranosecore and represents the first ellagitannin having an HHDPgroup at the C-3 and C-4 positions. The biphenyl bond of theHHDP group is formed by oxidative coupling between twogalloyl groups attached to the glucopyranose core,5) and itsatrop isomerism depends on the position where the galloylgroups are located, though there are a few exceptions.3,6,8) Inthis respect, cercidinin A is the first and sole example indi-cating that oxidative coupling between two galloyl groups,located at the 3,4-positions of glucose, generates an (R)-HHDP group.ExperimentalGeneral 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained with Varian Unityplus 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H, and 125 MHz for 13C,respectively. the HMBC experiment (nJCH optimized for 8 Hz) was per-formed using standard Varian pulse sequences.Cercidinin A (1) An off-white amorphous powder, [a]D 271.6°(c51.0, acetone), FAB-MS m/z: 961 (M1Na)1, 1H-NMR (500 Hz, acetone-d61D2O, 9 : 1, v/v) d : 7.15 (2H, s, C-6 galloyl-H), 7.11 (4H, s, C-1 and C-2galloyl-H), 6.71 (1H, s, HHDP-39), 6.47 (1H, s, HHDP-3), 6.28 (1H, d,J58.1 Hz, H-1), 5.63 (1H, dd, J58.8, 10.1 Hz, H-3), 5.58 (1H, dd, J58.1,10.1 Hz, H-2), 5.36 (1H, dd, J58.8, 10.1 Hz, H-4), 4.69 (1H, br d,J510.8 Hz, H-6), 4.54 (1H, dd, J54.2, 10.8 Hz, H-6), 4.51 (1H, br dd,J54.2, 10.1 Hz, H-5). 13C-NMR (125 MHz, acetone-d61D2O) d : 169.1[COO (connected to glucose C-3)], 168.7 [COO (C-4)], 166.5 [COO (C-6)],165.9 [COO (C-2)], 165.0 [COO (C-1)], 146.1, 146.0 [galloyl-3, 5 (C-1, 2)],145.9 [galloyl-3, 5 (C-6)], 145.2, 145.1 (HHDP-4, 49), 144.4, 144.3 (HHDP-6, 69), 139.8, 139.5 [galloyl-4 (C-1, 2)], 139.0 [galloyl-4 (C-6)], 136.4, 136.4(HHDP-5, 59), 126.1, 126.0 (HHDP-2, 29), 120.9 [galloyl-1 (C-6)], 120.16.119.5 [galloyl-1 (C-1, 2)], 114.6, 114.5 (HHDP-1, 19), 110.2, 110.0 [galloyl-2, 6 (C-1, 2)], 109.9 [galloyl-2, 6 (C-6)], 107.5 (HHDP-39), 107.3 (HHDP-3), 93.5 (C-1), 77.0 (C-3), 72.7 (C-5), 72.6 (C-4), 70.5 (C-2), 62.5 (C-6).Tannase Hydrolysis Compound 1 (45 mg) in water (3 ml) was stirredwith tannase at room temperature for 4 h.
