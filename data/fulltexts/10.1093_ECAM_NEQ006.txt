The rhizome of Atractylodes ovata De Candolle is rich in essential oils, which are usually removed by processing. In this study,
anti-oxidative abilities of essential oils and aqueous extracts of A. ovata rhizome were explored, and the inﬂuence of processing on
the anti-oxidative abilities was examined. Essential oils and aqueous extracts ofA. ovata were extracted by boiling water and steam
distillation, respectively. Quality of these two A. ovata samples was controlled by HPLC and GC-MS system, and anti-oxidative
abilitieswerethenevaluated.ResultsshowedthatsurfacecolorofA.ovataturnedtobrownandchemicalcomponentswerechanged
by processing. Contents of both atractylon and atractylenolide II decreased in the essential oils,but onlythe contents ofatractylon
decreased by processing. Atractylenolide III increased in both A. ovata samples. However, A. ovata essentialoils displayed stronger
anti-oxidative abilities than aqueous extracts in DPPH-scavenging, TBH-induced lipid peroxidation and catalase activity assays.
Moreover, the bioactivity of essential oils from raw A. ovata was stronger than oils from processed A. ovata. On the other hand,
cytotoxicity of A. ovata essential oils was stronger than that of aqueous extracts, and was more sensitive on H9C2 cell than NIH-
3T3 and WI-38 cells. In contrast, stir-frying processing method increased cytotoxicity of essential oils, but the cytotoxicity was
ameliorated when processed with assistantsubstances. The results suggested that phytochemical components and bioactivity of A.
ovata were changed after processing and the essential oils from raw A. ovata showed better anti-oxidative and fewer cytotoxicity
eﬀects.
1.Introduction
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are widely used to
prevent and treat human diseases. However, the pharmaco-
logical functions of certain TCMs depend on free radical-
scavenging activities [1]. Oxidative stress is associated with
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Uncontrolled free
radicals can damage myocardial cells, oxidize low-density
lipoproteins and eventually result in cardiovascular diseases
[2, 3]. In addition, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS)
also induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in mice [4].
ROS are generated through various pathways, for example,
pollutants, UV light and other mechanisms [5].
Atractylodes ovata De Candolle is classiﬁed in TCMs as a
tonic herb. Traditional applications of A. ovata were used to
invigorate the stomach and spleen by eliminating dampness
and to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Many pharmacological
eﬀectsoftheA.ovataaqueousextracts(ARE),includinganti-
inﬂammation, anti-tumor and immunoregulatory proper-
ties have been reported [6–8]. In regard to its chemical con-
stituents, about 0.3–9% essential oils were found in A. ovata,
including hinesol, β-eudesmol, palmitic acid and linoleic
acid [9–11]. In addition, atractylon (AT), atractylenolides
II (AT-II) and III (AT-III) were the major sesquiterpenoids
in the A. ovata essential oils (ARO). In our previous study,
AT was reported to have strong anti-oxidative abilities [12].
As also previously described, pharmacological eﬀects of ARE
were well studied, but the anti-oxidative abilities of the ARO
were not very clear.
In TCMs, Chinese herbs are often processed before
use. The chemical compositions, eﬃcacy and cytotoxicity
of herbs were changed after processing. Diﬀerent processing2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
methods were employed for TCMs, for example, stir-frying,
soaking and carbonizing. A. ovata was usually heated and
extra essential oils were removed for detoxiﬁcation before
use. Stir-frying with assistant substances (e.g., red soil or
burnt clay) was the most popular processing method for
A. ovata in TCM factories in Taiwan. Red soil and burnt
clay are common assistant substances used in modern
herbal processing. Red soil contains high concentrations of
unhydrated iron oxides, aluminum oxide and heavy clay.
Burnt clay is taken from the lining of kitchen stove [13].
Therefore, the anti-oxidative eﬀects of ARE and ARO, as well
as whether processing inﬂuences the anti-oxidative abilities
and cytotoxicity of both samples were explored.
In thisstudy, A.ovatawasprocessed bydiﬀerentmethods
and the qualities of processed A. ovata were evaluated
by colorimetric analysis. ARE and ARO were extracted
by boiling water and steam distillation, respectively. The
chemical compositions were analyzed by HPLC and GC-
MS system. Cytotoxicity and anti-oxidative eﬀects of raw
and processed AREs and AROs were also measured by
DPPH radical-scavenging, ESR-spin trapping, TBH-induced
lipid peroxidation in heart tissue, catalase activity assays
and MTT assay, respectively. Our experimental procedure is
summarized in Figure 1.
2.Methods
2.1. Animals. Male Wistar rats weighing about 250 ± 10g
were purchased from the BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd. and
kept on a 12:12-h day: night cycle. Animals were maintained
in polycarbonate cages at 21 ± 2◦C and provided food
and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures involving
animals followed the ethical regulations of Taipei Medical
University (Approval No. LAC-97-0122).
2.2. Quantitative Colorimetric Analysis of Processed A. ovata .
The processing procedures of A. ovata were described in our
previous study [13]. Processed samples were included raw
materials, stir-frying without assistant substances for 5min,
stir-frying with red soil for 5min, stir-frying with burnt
clay for 5min and stir-frying without assistant substances
for 30min. Color measurement of A. ovata was performed
usingtheKonicaMinoltaColorMeter(ModelCR-10,Konica
MinoltaSensing,Osaka,Japan). TheCR-10wascomposedof
8 mm diameter measuring area with a diﬀuse illumination
8◦ viewing and the color measurements of A. ovata were
detected on the surface. Each kind of processed A. ovata
was measured in triplicate. Results were presented as the
CIE L∗a∗b∗ color system. L∗ values indicated white or dark
samples.A reductioninwhiteness, as evidencedbyadecrease
in L∗ values, indicates darker samples. The highest a∗ values
and b∗ values expressed redness and yellowness, respectively.
2.3. Preparation and Quality Control of the A. ovata Aqueous
Extracts. Diﬀerent A. ovata samples were immersed in
puriﬁed deionized water and boiled for at least 30 min
until half of the original amount was left. Aqueous solutions
were then ﬁltered, and vacuum freeze-dried. The above

Raw A. ovata was processed by diﬀerent methods, and AREs and
AROswereextracted byboilingwaterandsteamdistillation,respec-
tively. AREs and AROs were quality controlled by colorimetry,
HPLC and GC-MS system and were used to evaluate the anti-
oxidative abilities and cytotoxicity eﬀects of A. ovata.
preparative procedures were stipulated by the Committee on
Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy of Department of Healthin
Taiwan.
AmountsofAT,AT-IIandAT-IIIwereanalyzedviaHPLC
system. HPLC apparatuses were composed of a SCL-10Avp
System Controller, an LC-10ATvp Liquid Chromatograph
Pump, an SPD-M10A Diode Array Detector, a SIL-10Avp
Auto Injector, a CTO-10A Column Oven, FCV-10Avp Flow-
Channel Selection Valves (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and
an ERC-3415 Degasser (ERC, Altegolfsheim, Regensburg,
Germany). The stationary phase consisted of a Purospher
STAR RP-18e reversed-phase column (5μm, 4mm i.d ×
250mm, Merck) and an acetonitrile-water system was used
as the mobile phase in the gradient mode as follows:
acetonitrile: 0–10min, 40–5%; 10–20min, 45–55%; 20–
30min, 55–100% and 30–40min, 100–55%. The ﬂow rateEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3
was 1mlmin−1, and the oven temperature was maintained
at 40◦C. We used UV wavelengths of 220nm to detect the
amount of AT and 236nm to detect the amounts of AT-II
and AT-III.
2.4. Preparation and Quality Control of the A. ovata Essential
Oils. A. ovata was crumbled and passed through a no. 20
meshstandard sieve.Weweighed70gofpowdersamples and
mixed them with 5 volumes puriﬁed deionized water. Steam
distillation of the essential oil was performed in a Clevenger-
type apparatus for 7h according to the Pharmacopoeia
of Traditional Medicine in Taiwan. The essential oils were
stored in an anhydrous situation. Quality control of the
essential oils was analyzed via HPLC and GC-MS system.
The HPLC analysis procedure was modiﬁed from our
previous study [13]. Analytical instruments were the same
as the previous described. The stationary phase consisted
of a Purospher STAR RP-18e reversed-phase column (5μm,
4mmi.d× 250mm, Merck) and mobile phase was CH3CN-
H2O (80 : 20, v/v) for AT and CH3CN-H2O (45 : 55, v/v) for
AT-II and AT-III. All mobile phases were degassed by ultra-
sonicationand ﬁlteredthrougha 0.45-μmFPVericel(PVDF)
membrane (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The
ﬂow rate was 1mlmin−1 and the oven temperature was
maintained at 40◦C. We used UV wavelengths of 220nm to
detect the amount of AT and 236nm to detect the amounts
of AT-II and AT-III.
The GC-MS system was composed of a gas chromato-
graph GC-2010 equipped with gas chromatography mass
spectrometer GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). A
DB-5MS column (0.25mm i.d × 30m × 0.25μmﬁ l m ,
J&W Scientiﬁc, Folsom, CA, USA) was performed with
Helium as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 73.0kPa.
Injection temperature and ion source temperature were 150
and 200◦C, respectively. The GC oven temperature was
programmed to be maintained at 50◦Cf o r5m i na n d
then rise to 250◦Ca t2 0 ◦Cm i n −1 for 10min. Results were
obtained by collecting the scan mass spectra between the
scan range 40 and 800amu. The mass spectra of the six
major peaks in GC-MS chromatogram were compared with
the database of NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library for
identiﬁcation of possible components.
2.5. Anti-Oxidative Assay
2.5.1. DPPH Scavenging Assay. The assay protocol of 1,1-
diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging activities was
modiﬁed from the previous study [14]. Test samples were
dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted into diﬀerent
concentrations. Each sample was mixed with the DPPH
ethanolic solution (100μM) on a 96-well microplate at
room temperature for 10min. Ascorbic acid was used as
the positive control. DPPH level of each well was evaluated
by detecting the optical density of each well at 530nm
with ELISA spectrophotometer (μQuant, BioTek, USA). The
DPPH scavenging rate (%) of each sample was calculated
accordingthefollowing equation:[1 −(Ss/EC)] × 100,where
Ss and EC were the optical density value of the sample and
control, respectively.
2.5.2. ESR-Spin Trapping Assay. A Bruker EMX electron
spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) spectrometer was used
to detect the ESR trapping and the experimental protocol
was modiﬁed from the previous report [15]. DPPH radical
was used to generate the excess free radical. In sample prepa-
ration, DPPH (500μM) and test samples were thoroughly
mixed and reacted for 2min. ESR spectra were recorded
at room temperature using a quartz ﬂat cell designed for
aqueoussolutions.DeadtimeofsamplepreparationandESR
analysis was exactly 30s after the last addition. Conditions
of ESR spectrometry were as follows: 20mW power at
9.78GHz, with a scan range of 100G and a receiver gain of
5 × 104. The modulation amplitude, sweep time, and time
constant are given in the ﬁgure captions.
2.5.3. Lipid Peroxidation Assay. Heart tissue was obtained
from Wistar rats and homogenized in PBS. This homog-
enized solution was centrifuged for 10min at 1200rpm.
Protein level in the homogenized tissue was quantiﬁed with
Bioquant (Merck, Germany). The homogenized tissue was
treated with125mMtert-butylhydroperoxide(TBH)with or
without test samples and eventually reacted with thiobarbi-
turic acid (TBA) to form the pink adducts, malondialdehyde
(MDA). The optical density was measured at 530nm with
μQuant spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA).
2.5.4.Catalase ActivityAssay. Thecatalaseassay protocolwas
modiﬁed from the previous study [16–18]. A discontinuous
method for measuring catalase used the ferrous oxidation
in xylenol orange solution and detected at 560nm with
μQuant spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). Catalase activity
was represented in units of μmol min−1 ml−1.
2.6. Cytotoxicity Assay. The H9C2 (normal rat cardiomy-
ocytes) and NIH-3T3 (normal mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast)
cell lines were maintained in DMEM medium, supporting
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% fetal calf
serum, respectively. WI-38 (normal human diploid cell line)
cell line was maintained in MEM medium with 10% FBS.
When conﬂuent, cells were washed with phosphate-buﬀered
saline (PBS), trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in PBS,
washed with fresh culture medium and transferred to 96-
well plates (1 × 105 cells ml−1) for the cytotoxicity assays.
Diﬀerent test samples were dissolved in DMSO at suitable
concentrations and store at –20◦C. Test samples were added
to each cell line for 24h without renewal ofthe medium. The
number of surviving cells was then counted using the MTT
assay. Finally, the products were evaluated by measuring
the optical density of each well at 600nm with μQuant
spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA).
2.7. Statistical Analysis. Data are presented as the mean and
standard deviation (SD). Signiﬁcance was calculated using
Student’st-test and one-way ANOVA test.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

3.Results
3.1. Quality Control of Diﬀerent Processed A. ovata . After
being processed by diﬀerent methods, CIE L∗a∗b∗ values
of processed A. ovata were analyzed (Table 1). Raw A. ovata
(A) expressed the highest L∗ values, indicating whitest color.
Moreover, stir-frying with red soil for 5min (C) displayed
the highest a∗ values (redness) and b∗ values (yellowness),
due to the assistant substances, red soil. Finally, we collected
200 pieces of processed A. ovata for each group whose CIE
L∗a∗b∗ values were nearly the same for following assays.
First, theHPLC chromatogramofAT,AT-II andAT-III in
AREswas shown inFigure 2(a)and their retention time were
35.5, 26.1 and 16.8min, respectively. Low concentrations of
AT, AT-II and AT-III were found in AREs. Raw A. ovata
had the highest AT concentration (0.071 ± 0.003μgmg −1)
among the diﬀerent AREs, but it was diminished by stir-
frying. After processing, concentrations of AT-II and AT-
III in the aqueous extracts from processed A. ovata were
about 1.5–2.0-fold higher than those from the raw A.
ovata (Table 2). Secondly, Figure 2(b) displayed the HPLC
c h r o m a t o g r a m so fA Ti nA R O sa n di t sr e t e n t i o nt i m e
was 12.5min. Besides, the HPLC chromatogram of AT-II
and AT-III in AROs was shown in Figure 2(c) and their
retention time were 14.5min and 32.1min, respectively.
Concentrations of the three sesquiterpenoids in the AROs
were higher than those in AREs. The highest AT concen-
trations (266.70 ± 3.63μgmg −1) were also found in raw
ARO. AT and AT-II concentrations were also decreased
by processing, but AT-III increased (Table 2)i nt h eA R O .
Moreover, the GC-MS ﬁngerprint proﬁle of raw ARO was
shown in Figure 3(a). We chose six major components as
standard peaks of the AROs. After comparing with the
database, their retention time (min) and molecular weight
(amu) were β-caryophyllene (10.6and 204), β-selinene (11.0
and 204), γ-selinene (11.4 and 204), AT (12.3 and 216),
AT-II (13.5 and 232) and stereoisomer of AT-II (15.2 and
232),respectively. Compositions ofthe processed AROswere
totally diﬀerent due to the diﬀerent processing methods
(Table 3). Likewise, concentrations of these six components
in AROs were altered by the diﬀerent processing methods
(Figure 3(b)).

3.2. DPPH-Scavenging Eﬀects of the A. ovataAqueousExtracts
and Essential Oils. DPPH-radical scavenging activities were
employed to evaluate the chemically anti-oxidative eﬀects
of diﬀerent AREs and AROs. Firstly, no signiﬁcant DPPH-
scavenging abilities were found in AREs at 5mgml−1 (data
notshown). However,asshown inTable 4,essentialoilsfrom
raw A. ovata (A, 5mg ml−1) displayed the same DPPH-
scavenging abilities as ascorbic acid (2.5mM) and with theEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5

(E, 33.19%). According to the above results, AROs were
evaluated in further anti-oxidative assays.
3.3. ESR-Spin Trapping Assay of the A. ovata Essential Oils.
In the ESR-spin trapping assay, DPPH radical was used as
the free radical generator. As shown in Figure 4,ﬁ v em a j o r
free radical signals were found in the DPPH group. All ﬁve
diﬀerentAROs showed inhibitory activity against DPPH free

them, raw ARO (A, 5mgml−1) displayed the strongest anti-
oxidative eﬀect.

of the A. ovata Essential Oils. According to many etiological
studies, oxidative stress played an important role in causing
many diseases, that is, inﬂammation and malignant tumor.
Thus, the eﬀects of diﬀerent AROs on TBH-induced lipid
peroxidation were evaluated. Essential oils from raw (A,
500μgml −1) and stir-frying with red soil for 5min (C,

500μgml −1) A. ovata displayed signiﬁcant anti-lipid perox-
idative activities compared to the other AROs (Figure 5(a)),
suggesting that it has stronger MDA inhibitory eﬀects.
In addition, all AROs exhibited increased catalase activity.
Essential oils from raw A. ovata(A,500μgml −1)s ign iﬁ can tly
displayed stronger catalase-increasing activity compared to
the other AROs (Figure 5(b)).
3.5. Cytotoxicity Eﬀects of the Essential Oils and Aqueous
Extracts from A. ovata . As shown in Table 5, the cytotoxicity
eﬀects of AT were stronger than those of AT-II and AT-
III, and AT was more sensitive in the H9C2 cell line. In
addition, cytotoxicity of AROs on H9C2 cell was also more
sensitivethantheothercelllines.Firstly,AROsresultingfrom
stir-frying without assistant substances for 5min (B) and
for 30min (E) displayed stronger cytotoxicity on H9C2 cell
line than did raw AROs. Once A. ovata was stir-fried with
assistant substances, for example, red soil and burnt clay,
cytotoxicity eﬀects were ameliorated on H9C2 cell. On NIH-
3T3 and WI-38 cell lines, raw ARO showed less cytotoxicity
than other AROs. However, none of the aqueous extracts
from A. ovata showed cytotoxicity eﬀects at 1000μgml −1 for
24h on these three normal cell lines.

eﬀective anti-oxidative activities [19–22]. In addition, the
vasorelaxive eﬀect of Croton nepetaefolius and anti-fungal
activities of Chenopodium ambrosioides were due to the
essential oils [23, 24]. A. ovata was rich in essential oils, but
few researches had examined the pharmacological functions
of the A. ovata essential oils. Only in Zhang’s study,
essential oils from Atractylodes lancea had regulatory eﬀects
on delayed gastric emptying in stress-induced rats [25].
Pharmacologicalcharacteristics ofA.ovatawere warm, bitter
and sweet and commonly used for tonifying and regulating
Qi. Doctors usually used A. ovata to supple the spleen, boost
the stomach, dry dampness and harmonize the center. A.

diﬀerent clinical needs. Raw A. ovata displayed stronger
tonifying eﬀectsthanprocessedA.ovataandwasusuallyused
to treat appetite loss, indigestion and tiredness. However,
processing enhanced the drying dampness eﬀectsofA.ovata.
Processing is an important part of preparing Chinese
herbs. Characteristics of Chinese herbs are changed through
diﬀerent processing methods. Concentrations of glucosino-
lates, the active componentsofBrassica vegetables,decreased
after being heated [26]. Variations in chemical composition
after processing were correlated to alterations in cytotoxicity
and eﬃcacy of Chinese herbs. In Li’s study, processing
reduced the acute diarrhea eﬀects of Rheum palmatum due
to a decrease in the anthraquinone contents [27]. However,
maintaining an equal processing level was an important
issue. Many reactions occurred during thermal processing
of Chinese herbs, like the changes in ﬂavor and color seen8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
after heat treatment. The browning reaction that caused the
color changes of Chinese herbs was formed by variations of
phytochemical components during heating, resulting in the
plantcolorchanges[28].ProdelphinidinD3andprocyanidin
B3, the phenolic compounds of barley grain, were easily
auto-oxidized during heating and contributed to browning
of the heated barley products [29]. Thus, we controlled the
processed level through colorimetric values in this study
(Table 1). The diﬀerent processing techniques changed the
various AREs and AROs compositions. In our previous
study, we described that AT, AT-II and AT-III were the
major A. ovata components. Hence, the amounts of AT, AT-
II and AT-III in raw and processed A. ovata were ﬁrstly
quantiﬁed by HPLC analysis system. In addition, because
of the evaporative tendency of the ARO sesquiterpenoids,
we used GC-MS system to evaluate the ARO component
variations after heat-processing.
In the anti-oxidative assays, AROs displayed stronger
DPPH-scavenging eﬀects than AREs (Table 4). Our results
showed that raw ARO displayed stronger anti-oxidative
abilities than processed AROs in ESR-spin trapping, DPPH-
scavenging, TBH-induced lipid peroxidation in heart tissue
and catalase activity assays. Changes in the ARO chemical
compositions were correlated with their respective anti-
oxidative activities. AT was the most potent anti-oxidative
components in ROS-induced lipid peroxidation [30]. In
stir-frying processing, AT was converted to the non-anti-
oxidative components, AT-II and AT-III, and the A. ovata
essential oils had largely evaporated because of the heating.
These phenomenons were possibly the reason that processed
A. ovata lost its anti-oxidative abilities.
Cytotoxicity eﬀects of AROs and AREs on H9C2, NIH-
3T3 and WI-38 cells were also evaluated. The normal
rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) cell line was chosen because
of the TBH-induced heart lipid peroxidation assay. In
addition, based on the European Centre for the Validation
of Alternative Methods (ECVAM, ISO 9001), NIH-3T3 and
WI-38 cell lines were used to evaluate the alternative non-
animal cytotoxicity tests [31]. As shown in Table 5,A T
displayed the strongest cytotoxicity eﬀects among the three
sesquiterpenoids. In our previous study, we discussed the
variations in chemical components and cytotoxicity between
raw and processed A. ovata [13]. AT showed the strongest
cytotoxicity on diﬀerent tumor cell line, but AT-II and AT-
I I Id i dn o t .H o w e v e r ,c y t o t o x i c i t ye ﬀects of the essential oils
from raw A. ovata which contained the greatest amounts of
AT were not stronger than those from processed A. ovata on
these three normal cell lines. We suggested that although AT
was the stronger compound, amounts of AT in the essential
oils of raw A. ovata (266.70 ± 3.63 μgm g −1)w a si n s u ﬃcient
to cause cell death.
In TCM, the general therapeutical rule of Qi-tonifying
herbs was reported to promote blood circulation, activate
vital energy circulation and to strengthen the body [32].
Previous study had shown that essential oil played an
important role in promoting blood circulation and ﬂow [33,
34]. Accordingto Lou’sstudy, circulatory function correlated
to the anti-oxidative activities [35]. In this study, heat
processing caused a large loss of A. ovata essential oils. We
found that loss of essential oils resulted in a reduction of A.
ovata anti-oxidative eﬀects. Taken together, the cytotoxicity
eﬀects of A. ovata essential oils were slightly inﬂuenced by
processing. On the other hand, processing resulted in a large
loss oftheanti-oxidativeabilitiesoftheA.ovataessential oils.
In conclusion, A. ovata was a potent anti-oxidative
Chinese herb whose anti-oxidative eﬀects were decreased by
processing. As shown in Figure 6, we suggested that raw A.
ovata essential oil was a more useful anti-oxidant for its
tonifying eﬀects than was processed A.ovata essential oil.
