From an extract of Veronica (sect. Hebe) lavaudiana we have identified mannitol and isolated 11 iridoid 
glucosides, the carbohydrate ester hebitol II, and four phenylethanoid glycoside esters. Five of the 
iridoid glycosides are new; of these, lavaudioside A, B, and C (2a, 3a, and 4) are 1-mannityl esters of 8-
epiloganic acid while 7e and 7f are 6'-O-caffeoyl derivatives of catalpol. The new phenylethanoid 
glycoside esters, helioside A, B, and C (8b-8d), are 6'-xylosyl derivatives of aragoside. The structures of 
the new compounds were elucidated mainly by spectroscopic analysis, but also by chemical degradation. 
We also demonstrated that the structures of the known glycosides globularitol as well as hebitols I and II 
should be revised. These compounds are derivatives of mannitol and not glucitol as previously believed.

Veronica (sect. Hebe) lavaudiana Raoul is an endemic subshrub that grows on basalt outcrops and 
cliffs above 150 m altitude on Banks Peninsula on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand.1 
The peninsula, reaching an altitude of about 900 m, is formed from two extinct volcanoes and has at 
times in the past been separated as an island. V. lavaudiana and its nearest relatives in the sect. Hebe 
belong in the sun hebe clade.2 It has been formerly treated as the genus Heliohebe1 or as part of Hebe3 or 
Parahebe,4 all of which are now included in a broad and monophyletic concept of Veronica.5  Little 
chemical work has been undertaken on V. lavaudiana. Thus, this species was included in an early 
chemotaxonomic survey of iridoids and flavonoids in Veronica and related genera,6 and in a recent 
LC/MS investigation on the flavonoid chemistry of the five species of Heliohebe.7 
 
Fresh plant material was blended with cold MeOH and the water-soluble part of the extract was 
subjected to a series of chromatographic procedures. Seventeen compounds were isolated and identified 
including the hexitol, mannitol (1), the carbohydrate ester hebitol II (5), 11 iridoid glucosides (2a, 3a, 4, 
6, 7-7f), and four phenylethanoid glycoside esters (8, 8b-8d). Of these, the five iridoids 2a, 3a, 4, 7e, 7f 
and the three phenylethanoids 8b-8d are new.  
 
The composition of the sugar fraction was deduced by interpretation of the 13C NMR data only. 
Structural elucidations of the new compounds were carried out by spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D 
NMR, MS) and chemical degradation. Despite intensive purification, most of the compounds contained 
minor concentrations of cis-caffeoyl or -feruloyl isomers. Compound 8d, contained 8% of the cis-form, 
in accord with our previous experience that feruloyl esters readily isomerize. 
 
Lavaudioside A (2a) was obtained as an amorphous solid [α]20D -30. The molecular formula was 
C31H42O18, as deduced from the 13C NMR data and the quasimolecular ion obtained by LC-HRESIMS 
(observed m/z 720.2713 [M + NH4]+). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) in methanol-d4 showed five 
 4 
resonances corresponding to the presence of a caffeoyl group (δH 7.51 to 6.24). An additional resonance 
at δH 7.53 (s, H-3), as well as two more at δH 5.55 (d, H-1) and δH 4.68 (d, H-1') suggested that 2a was a 
carboxylated iridoid glucoside. Furthermore, the three-proton doublet at δH 1.10 showed the presence of 
a C-10 methyl group. In the 13C NMR spectrum, 30 resonances were observed of which one (δC 169.0) 
was of double intensity. Nine of the resonances were consistent with the presence of a caffeoyl group. 
Of the remaining resonances in the spectrum, 16 were similar to those reported for a 7-O-acyl derivative 
of the iridoid glucoside epiloganic acid (2),8 including those from the 1-O-β-glucopyranosyl group. The 
remaining six resonances were all in the δC 65-73 region, which suggested the presence of a hexityl 
moiety. This was consistent with the 1H NMR spectrum, where the signals not accounted for were 
observed in the shift interval δH 3.65-4.44. The HMBC spectrum allowed the carbons of attachment 
between the iridoid moiety and the peripheral parts to be discerned. Thus, the position of the ester group 
was confirmed by an HMBC correlation between H-7 (δH 4.9) and the carbonyl carbon of the caffeoyl 
group (δC 169.0). The 1'''-CH2-resonances of the hexityl moiety at δH 4.44 and 4.21 showed correlations 
with the carbonyl carbon (δC 169.0) of the iridoid core and to a carbinol signal (δC 70.5), which could 
therefore be assigned as C-2'''. The HSQC spectrum designated the remaining resonances at δC 65.1, 
72.8, 70.9 and 70.8, as one CH2OH and three CHOH groups, respectively, thereby fulfilling the 
molecular formula determined by the MS. The first three shift values closely matched those of mannitol 
(1). Confirmation that the hexitol was indeed mannitol was achieved by an in-NMR tube hydrolysis of 
2a with ammonia in D2O. After 48 h at room temperature, 13C NMR resonances corresponding to 
mannitol were observed at δC 64.5 (C-1 and 6), 72.1 (C-2 and 5), and 70.5 (C-3 and 4).9 These increased 
in intensity following the addition of authentic mannitol (see Supporting Information).  
 
Lavaudioside B (3a) was obtained as an amorphous solid [α]22D -24. The molecular formula was 
C31H40O18, as deduced by the 13C NMR data and LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 718.2558 [M + NH4]
+). 
The NMR data (Table 1) in methanol-d4 was assigned as above. The 1H NMR spectrum was similar to 
 5 
that of 2a, including a caffeoyl and a mannityl group, as well as the resonance at δH 7.62 (1H, s, H-3) 
and others at δH 5.41 and 4.70, assigned to H-1 and H-1', respectively. The major differences were in the 
iridoid moiety. Thus, additional resonances (δH 5.48 and 5.45) were present while those from a methyl 
group were missing. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 3a, the expected 31 resonances were observed. When 
compared with the spectrum of 2a, only the resonances for the iridoid aglucone differed. The two 
resonances at δC 148.9 and 116.5 suggested an iridoid with an 8,10-double bond, in accordance with the 
1H NMR data. A comparison with the data reported8 for a 7-O-acyl derivative of gardoside (3) showed a 
satisfactory coincidence for the chemical shift values. 
 
Lavaudioside C (4) was isolated as an amorphous solid [α]22D -48, and the molecular formula was 
C46H58O26, deduced by the 13C NMR data and LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 1027.3269 [M + H]+). The 
1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was similar to that of 2a, but resonances from two caffeoyl groups were 
present. Also, two β-hexopyranosyl groups were considered present due to the two doublets at δH 4.69 
and 4.36. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 4, 39 resonances were observed, of which five were of 
double and one (δC 71.6) was of triple intensity, as also confirmed by the HSQC data. Eighteen of the 
resonances could be assigned to the two caffeoyl groups and comparing with the data for 2a, a further 16 
could be assigned to an epiloganyl moiety including its 1-O-glucosyl group. This left 12 13C NMR 
resonances to be accounted for. That at δC 105.0 was assigned to an anomeric carbon atom and the 
remaining 11, resonating at δC 64-78, suggested the presence of a hexopyranosyl and a hexityl moiety. 
2D NMR data suggested that the hexopyranosyl moiety was an additional β-glucopyranosyl group but 
the full structure of 4 could only be resolved in relation to that of hebitol II (5). 
 
The sugar ester hebitol II (5), was considered to be composed of a 6-O-caffeoyl-β-D-glucopyranose 
moiety with a 1-glucityl group as the aglucone.10 The structure of 5 was originally elucidated by 
comparison of the NMR data of an analogue, the feruloyl ester globularitol (5b) isolated from 
 6 
Globularia orientalis.11 The structure of 5b was in turn inferred by deacylation and comparison by TLC 
of the resulting disaccharide with authentic β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-glucitol (5d), obtained by 
NaBH4 reduction of gentiobiose.  However, because the corresponding 13C NMR shift values of 5 (for 
C-1''' to C-3''' in Table 1) compared better with those of β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-mannitol (5c)12 than 
with those of the glucitol derivative, we therefore decided to re-examine the structure of 5. Thus, 
treatment of 5 with ammonia in D2O gave a disaccharide with a 13C NMR spectrum (see Supporting 
Information) identical to that reported for 5c. The similar levorotatory activity of 5 and 5a-5c pointed to 
the β-D-form of the glucose moiety in the four compounds (See Supporting Information). Consequently, 
the structures of the three analogues hebitol II (5), hebitol I (5a),10 and globularitol (5b)11 must be 
revised to the β-D-glucosylmannitol derivatives shown in the formula chart. 
 
Returning to the structure of 4, the resonances of the caffeoyl and β-glucopyranosyl groups found in 4, 
but not in 2a, were coincident with the corresponding resonances of 5. In addition, those from C-1''' 
through C-3''' for 4 were almost coincident with the resonances of the corresponding carbon atoms of 2a, 
and the resonances of C-4''' to C-6''' were coincident with those of 5. This provided the hypothetical 
structure for 4. In the HMBC spectrum, correlations could be seen between the 1'''-CH2 group (δH 4.42 
and 4.20) and C-2''' (δC 70.7) as well as C-11 of the iridoid core (δC 169.0) since a cross-peak with H-5 
(δH 3.13) was also found at this shift value. Other correlations were seen between the 6'''-CH2 group (δH 
4.14 and 3.76) and C-5''' (δC 71.6) as well as the anomeric carbon atom C-1'''' of the internal β-
glucopyranosyl moiety (δC 105.0). Also, H-5'''' (δH 3.55) displayed a correlation with C-1'''', and 
furthermore, cross-peaks could be found between 6''''-CH2 (δH 4.22 and 4.28) and C-5'''' (δC 75.5) as well 
as one of the low field carbonyl carbon atoms (δC 169.1). Therefore, it was concluded that the latter 
could be assigned to one of the caffeic acid moieties. The structure of lavaudioside C has therefore been 
established as that shown by 4.

Compound 7e was obtained as an amorphous solid [α]D22 -70, and the molecular formula was 
C24H28O13, determined by the 13C NMR data and LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 523.1465 [M - H]-). The 
1H NMR data (Table 2) were somewhat similar to those of verminoside (7b)13 both containing a 
caffeoyl and a catalpol moiety. However, in 7e H-6 (δH 3.78) resonated 1.2 ppm upfield while the H-6' 
signals (δH 4.41 and 4.49) were 0.6 and 1.1 ppm downfield compared to those of 7b. This indicated that 
in 7e the caffeoyl moiety was located at the 6'-O-position. The conclusion was supported by the relative 
changes observed in the 13C NMR data. In the HMBC spectrum, correlations between 6'-CH2 (δH 4.49 
and 4.41) and the carbonyl carbon atom of the caffeoyl group (δC 169.0) confirmed that the structure of 
7e was 6'-O-caffeoylcatalpol. 
Compound 7f was also an amorphous solid [α]20D -20, with the molecular formula C33H34O16, 
deduced by the 13C NMR data and LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 709.1791 [M + Na]+). The 1H NMR 
data (Table 2) showed that the molecule contained one catalpol and two caffeoyl units. Comparison with 
the NMR data of 7b and 7e showed that in 7f, the resonances for the catalpol aglucone moiety were very 
similar to those of the former, while the resonances of the β-D-glucopyranosyl unit were similar to those 
of the latter. This suggested that the two caffeoyl groups were placed at the 6-O- and the 6'-O-positions 
of catalpol. Analysis of the HMBC spectrum confirmed this. Thus, the positions of the ester groups were 
confirmed by correlations between H-6 (δH 4.89) as well as by one of the 6'-CH2 protons (δH 4.47), and 
the carbonyl carbon atoms of the caffeoyl groups (δC 169.0 and 168.9), respectively. The structure of 
compound 7f was therefore 6,6'-di-O-caffeoylcatalpol. 
Helioside A (8b), [α]20D -23, had a molecular formula C39H52O24, as deduced by the 13C NMR data 
and LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 922.3200 [M+NH4]+). The NMR data (Table 3) were assigned by 2D 
NMR spectroscopy and by comparison with the model compounds aragoside (8)14 and its 6'-β-
glucopyranosyl derivative chionoside D (8a) from V. thomsonii (Buchanan) Cheeseman.15 The 13C NMR 
spectrum showed 37 resonances of which two (δC 115.3 and 77.8) were of double intensity. This 
 8 
included four signals at δC 103-106 arising from anomeric carbon atoms showing correlations with 
protons in the δΗ 4.2-4.7 region (HSQC). The NMR data (Table 2) were almost superimposable with 
those of 8a, a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyl β-D-glucopyranoside esterified with a caffeoyl group at C-4' and 
substituted with an α-arabinopyranosyl at C-2' and β-glucopyranosyl groups at C-3' and C-6'. However, 
one of the peripheral glucosyl groups of 8a was replaced by a pentosyl moiety in 8b, identified as a β-
xylopyranosyl group by the NMR data. The correlations in the HMBC spectrum confirmed the sites of 
attachment of the peripheral units. Thus, a cross-peak between H-1' (δH 4.51) of the central glucosyl 
moiety and C-8 (δC 72.2) proved the position of the aglycone. A correlation between H-4' (δH 4.96) and 
the carbonyl carbon atom of the caffeoyl ester (δC 168.6) showed the position of the acyl moiety. Cross-
peaks between H-1''' (δH 4.52) of the arabinosyl group and C-2' (δC 82.5), as well as between H-1'' (δH 
4.63) of the peripheral glucosyl group and C-3' (δC 81.2), demonstrated the positions of these sugar 
moieties. Finally, a correlation between H-1''''' of the xylosyl moiety (δH 4.24) and the 6'-CH2-group (δC 
69.1), proved the structure as shown by 8b. 
Helioside B (8c), [α]20D -25, had a molecular formula C48H58O27 as deduced by the 13C NMR data and 
LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 1084.3451 [M+NH4]+). The NMR data (Table 3) were assigned as above. 
When the NMR and MS data were compared with those of 8b it became apparent that 8c was a caffeoyl 
ester of the former. Beside the additional caffeoyl group, the 6''-CH2 resonances (δH 4.34, 4.27) of the 
peripheral glucopyranosyl group were found 0.6 and 0.8 ppm, respectively, downfield in the 1H NMR 
spectrum. Similarly, in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8c, C-6'' (δC 64.7) and C-5'' (75.1) of the peripheral β-
glucopyranosyl group were found 1.6 ppm downfield and 2.7 ppm upfield, respectively, when compared 
to the data for 8b. Therefore, the additional caffeoyl group was positioned at the C-6'' oxygen atom in 
helioside B. The correlations in the HMBC spectrum were consistent with this, including the cross-peak 
between one of the C-6'' protons (δH 4.27) and the ester carbonyl carbon atom assigned to the additional 
caffeoyl group (δC 169.1). Helioside B is therefore the 6''-caffeoyl ester of helioside A. 
 9 
 
Helioside C (8d), [α]20D -22, had the molecular formula C40H54O24, deduced by the 13C NMR data and 
LC-HRESIMS (observed m/z 936.3333 [M+NH4]+). The NMR data (Table 3) were coincident with 
those of 8b, except for the resonances of the aroyl moiety and for the presence of a methoxy group in 
8d. The chemical shift values (δH 3.90; δC 56.5), as well as a cross-peak between the O-methyl protons 
(δH 3.90) and C-3''''' (δC 149.4) were consistent with the presence of a feruloyl substituent in 8d. 
Consequently, helioside C is the feruloyl analogue of helioside A. 
 
Our study confirms the previous report6 of aucubin (6), catalpol (7), and the two catalpol esters 7a and 
7b in V. lavaudiana. Epiloganic acid (2) and gardoside (3), and their methyl esters are often found in 
plants containing 6 and 7 and have been reported from several Veronica species.10, 16-20 However, iridoid 
11-carboxylic acids esterified with alditols like 2a, 3a, and 4, found in the present study, have not been 
reported before. Hebitol II (5), isolated in the present work, adds to the variety of sugar esters found in 
this Veronica  sect. Hebe.10, 18-21 
 
Experimental Section 
General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 
polarimeter. One-dimensional 1H, 13C NMR and 2D DQF-COSY, gHSQC, gHMBC and NOESY NMR 
spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer in methanol-d4 and the chemical 
shifts are given as δ values with reference to the solvent peaks (δH 3.30 or δC 49.0, respectively). LC-
HRESIMS was performed on an Agilent HP 1100 HPLC equipped with a BDS-C18 reversed-phase 
column running a H2O-MeCN (50 ppm TFA in H2O) gradient. The LC was coupled to a LCT of a TOF 
MS (Micromass, Manchester, UK) operated in the positive electrospray ion mode using 5-
leucineenkephalin as lock mass. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 instrument. 
Preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series LC System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA) with a guarded Luna C18 column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex) kept at 40 °C and a Waters 
 10 
system (Watford, UK) with Genesis C18 column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Jones Chromatography, Mid 
Glamorgan, UK) at 30 °C, with MeOH-H2O mixtures as eluents at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The known 
compounds were identified by NMR and compared with published data: mannitol (1);9 epiloganic acid 
(2), gardoside (3), aucubin (6) and catalpol (7);22 verproside (7a);23 verminoside (7b) and minecoside 
(7d);13 6-O-feruloylcatalpol (7c).24 
 
Plant Material. Veronica lavaudiana Raoul was collected from plants cultivated in the grounds of 
Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand. A voucher specimen has been deposited at the Allan 
Herbarium, Landcare Research (CHR). 
Extraction and Isolation. Plant material (40 g, fresh wt.) was blended with MeOH and filtered. The 
concentrated extract (14 g) was partitioned between Et2O–H2O and the aqueous phase loaded on a 4 × 
45 cm Diaion HP-20 (Supelco, Bellefonte, US) column and eluted with H2O-MeOH mixtures. The

further separated by HPLC (Luna C18, 3 to 50% MeOH over 10 min) to give helioside A (8b, 191 mg) 
and helioside C (8d, 25 mg). The final purification of these was performed by HPLC on Genesis C18 
with 30% MeOH for 8b (135 mg) and 35% MeOH for 8d (4.1 mg). Fr. B (492 mg), further separated by 
HPLC (Luna C18, 30 to 60% MeOH over 10 min) to give aragoside (8, 63.4 mg); lavaudioside B (3a, 
 11 
12.6 mg); helioside B (8c, 24.0 mg); lavaudioside A (2a, 41.6 mg); and 6'-O-caffeoylcatalpol (7e, 2.7

HPLC (Luna C18, 30 to 50% MeOH over 10 min) to give 6'-O-caffeoylcatalpol (7e, 3.3 mg) and 
verminoside (7b, 268 mg). 
 
The fraction eluted with 60% MeOH (3.9 g) was separated on a Sephadex LH-20 column (3 × 40 cm) 
eluted with 90% MeOH to give: Fr. D (215 mg), further separated by HPLC (Luna C18, 35 to 45% 
MeOH over 15 min) to give aragoside (8, 11.0 mg), lavaudioside B (3a, 23.1 mg), verminoside (7b, 39.1 
mg) and a fraction (35.6 mg), purified by HPLC (Genesis C18, 42% MeOH) to give lavaudioside A (2a, 
17.1 mg). Fr. E (1.0 g), further separated on silica gel column (CHCl3-MeOH-H2O, 60:22:4) to give 
verminoside (7b, 645 mg). 
 
The fraction eluted with MeOH (1.8 g) was separated on Sephadex LH-20 column (2.5 × 50 cm) eluted 
with MeOH: Fr. F (866 mg) was further separated by HPLC (Luna C18, 45% MeOH over 10 min) to 
give verminoside (7b, 202 mg), 6-O-feruloylcatalpol (7c, 71.5 mg), minecoside (7d, 31 mg), and a

Treatment of 2a with Ammonium Hydroxide. Lavaudioside A (2a) (17 mg) was dissolved in D2O 
(0.7 mL) in an NMR tube (5 mm) and 25 % ammonium hydroxide (70 µL) was added. After 48 h at 
room temperature the 13C NMR spectrum was recorded (D2O, 75 MHz):  δC 64.5 (C-1 and 6), 72.1 (C-2 
and 4), 70.5 (C-3 and 5); after addition of excess mannitol, the three relevant resonances increased in 
size (see Supporting Info.).  
 
Treatment of 5 with Ammonium Hydroxide. Hebitol II (5) (13 mg) was dissolved in D2O (0.7 mL) 
in an NMR tube (5 mm) and 25 % ammonium hydroxide (70 µL) was added. After 72 h at room 
temperature the 13C NMR spectrum was recorded (D2O, 75 MHz):  δC 64,5 (C-1), 72.1 (C-2), 70.3 (C-
3), 70.9 (C-4), 70.9 (C-5), 73.1 (C-6), 104.2 (C-1'), 74.5 (C-2'), 76.9 (C-3'), 70.4 (C-4'), 77.3 (C-5'), 62.0 
(C-6') (see Supporting Info.)  coinciding with that reported for 5c.12
