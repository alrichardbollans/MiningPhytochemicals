The new diterpene was identified, after esterification withdiazomethane, as methyl (-)-(5R,8S,9S,10R)-clerod-3-en-15-oate and known diterpenes wereidentified as methyl (-)-copalate and methyl (-)-eperuate. From the EtOAc extract of seed pods aknown methyl (-)-zanzibarate was isolated. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidatedbased on spectroscopic studies.Keywords: Hymenaea courbaril var. altissima, ent-clerodane, ent-labdaneIntroductionHymenaea is a genus widely distributed from Centralto South America and is known popularly as “jatobá”,“jataí” or “jutaí”.1 The wood is used for woodwork andthe resin extract is locally used as a remedy for manypurposes.2 The chemical composition of the resin obtainedfrom some species of Hymenaea is already known in theliterature3 and recently we reported the isolation of twonew ent-clerodane derivatives from the seed pods resin ofH. courbaril var. stilbocarpa.4 We now describe theisolation of two known diterpenes (1, 2) and a novel ent-clerodane (3) from the ethyl acetate extract of H. courbarilvar. altissima (Ducke) barks, which grows mainly in asubtropical forest on the Atlantic Coast,5 and the isolationof a known diterpene (9) from the ethyl acetate extract ofits seed pods. Another five compounds (4-8) were alsoidentified by GC/MS analyses.Results and DiscussionThe ethyl acetate extract of H. courbaril var. altissimabarks was esterified with diazomethane and submitted to acombination of column chromatography (silica gel) andpreparative TLC on SiO2/AgNO3 (5%, w/w), to afford a newditerpene, methyl (-)-(5R,8S,9S,10R)-clerod-3-en-15-oate(3), along with the known methyl (-)-copalate (1)6 and methyl(-)-eperuate (2).7 Through GC/MS analysis of the methylatedextract, besides compounds 1-3, five known diterpenes werealso identified by their retention indices and by co-injectionwith authentic samples as: methyl isoozate (4),4 methyl ozate(5),4 methyl kovalenate (6),4 methyl (5S*,8S*,9S*,10R*)-clero-3,13-dien-15-oate (7)4 and methyl (5R*,8S*,9S*,10R*)-clero-3,13-dien-15-oate (8).4The ethyl acetate extract of seed pods of H. courbarilvar. altissima was esterified with diazomethane andsubmitted to a combination of column chromatography(silica gel), preparative TLC on SiO2/AgNO3 (5%, w/w)and RP-HPLC to give a known methyl (-)-zanzibarate (9).8Through GC/MS analysis of the methylated extract, threeknown diterpenes: methyl isoozate (4), methyl ozate (5)and methyl kovalenate (6) were also identified by retentionindices and by co-injection with authentic samples.4Methyl (-)-(5R,8S,9S,10R)-clerod-3-en-15-oate (3) wasobtained as colorless oil, [α]D20 – 54.0 (c 0.6, CHCl3) andHRMS data (m/z 320.27156) suggested the molecularformula C21H36O2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 showed twosignals at δ 0.89 (s, 3H) and 1.05 (s, 3H), corresponding to390 Nogueira et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.the methyl groups attached to a quaternary carbon andtwo signals at δ 0.90 (d, J 7.0 Hz, 3H) and 0.96 (d, J 6.6 Hz,3H), corresponding to the methyl groups attached to amethine carbon. Signal for an additional methyl group,attached to a sp2 carbon at δ 1.59 (brd, J 1.5 Hz, 3H) coupledto a vinylic hydrogen at δ 5.20 (brs, 1H), was observed.The full 1H and 13C NMR signals assignment was basedon homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D experiments (COSY-90, HSQC) and by comparison with the 13C NMR spectraldata of the previously isolated compound 8,4 which showeda good agreement for the chemical shifts of carbonsbelonging to the decalin moiety.The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed signals formethylene hydrogens (δ 2.13, dd, J 9.0 and 4.4 Hz; 2.35dd, J 9.0 and 4.4 Hz) adjacent to a carbomethoxyl groupand cross peaks in the COSY spectrum showing theircoupling to a methinic hydrogen at δ 1.88 (m). Thishydrogen was, in turn, connected to the methyl group at δ0.96 and methylene hydrogens at δ 1.33 (m). The 13C NMRdata connectivity analyses and comparison of 13C NMRdata of the side chain of 3 with those of 2 were in goodagreement. The chemical shift of carbon C-19, thatappeared at δ 20.6, confirms the trans relationship for A/Bring.4 The assignments for all signals were fully confirmedby HSQC and HMBC experiments.ExperimentalGeneral1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3solution at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively, with aBruker AC 300/P spectrometer (internal standard TMS).IR spectra of neat samples were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer1600 series FTIR. Mass spectra of purified compoundswere obtained at 70 eV on an Hewlett-Packard 5990/5970system equipped with a J&W Scientific DB-5 fused silicacapillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were performed with aVG 7070E spectrometer by electron impact with beamenergy of 70 eV. Optical rotations were measured with aCarl Zeiss photoelectric polarimeter.IsolationThe seed pods and barks of Hymenaea courbaril var.altissima (Ducke) were collected in March 1994 at FazendaSanta Elisa (IAC- Campinas), São Paulo State, Brazil. Avoucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of IB-UEC (# no. GS 01/03). Dry barks (360 g) were powderedand extracted with EtOAc (3L) for 5 days at roomtemperature. After filtration and evaporation of solvent atreduced pressure a crude extract (34 g) was obtained as anoily resin. A sample of resin (789 mg) was esterified withdiazomethane and submitted successively for purificationusing silica gel column chromatography (CHCl3: MeOH1% to 5%, v/v), prep TLC on SiO2/AgNO3 (5%, w/w) elutingwith a mixture of different solvents and polarity (petroleumether/EtOAc/CH2Cl2) to yield (-)-methyl copalate (1){11 mg, [α]D20 –19.0 CHCl3, c 0.7; lit.,6 [α]D20 –12.9}, methyleperuate (2) {15 mg, [α]D20 –24.0 CHCl3, c 1.1; lit.7, [α]D20–26.0} and methyl (-)-(5R,8R,9R,10S) clerod-3-en-15-oate(3) {12 mg, [α]D20 –54.0 CHCl3, c 0.6}. GC/MS analysis ofthe barks methylated extract indicated: methyl isoozate(4) (3.7%), methyl ozate (5) (3.9%), methyl kovalenate (6)(3.2%), methyl (5S*,8S*,9S*,10R*)-cleroda-3,13-dien-15-oate (7) (2.3%) and methyl (5R*,8S*,9S*,10R*)-cleroda-3,13-dien-15-oate (8) (0.8%).391A New ent-Clerodane Diterpene from Hymenaea courbaril var. altissimaVol. 13, No. 3, 2002Dry seed pods (2.5 kg) were powdered and extractedwith n-hexane (6L) for 5 days at room temperature. Afterfiltration and evaporation of solvent at reduced pressure acrude extract (110 g) was obtained as an oily resin. A sampleof resin (5 g) was submitted to acid and base extraction tofurnish acidic fraction (3.3 g).
