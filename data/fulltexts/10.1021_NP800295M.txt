Homalanthus nutans, used by Samoan healers to treat hepatitis, produces the antiviral compound 12-deoxyphorbol
13-acetate, prostratin (1). Prostratin is being developed as an adjuvant therapy to clear latent viral reservoirs, the major
obstacle to eradication of HIV-AIDS within the human body. A validated reversed-phase HPLC method was developed
to assay concentrations of 1 in H. nutans. A survey of four distinct populations on two different Samoan islands revealed
signiﬁcant variability in content. The stem tissue (range 0.2-52.6 µg/g 1), used by healers in indigenous therapies,
gave a higher median concentration of prostratin (3.5 µg/g) than root or leaf tissues (2.9 and 2.5 µg/g, respectively).
The high variability and skewness of these data indicate that cultivar selection for drug production will be important for
this species. The reversed-phase HPLC assay will allow plants to be selected for agricultural development and genetic
analysis by identifying those individuals above and below a 95% conﬁdence interval for the median concentration.
Prostratin (1) is a nontumor-promoting 12-deoxyphorbol ester
that has been shown to inhibit HIV-induced cell death and viral
replication in vitro. The antiviral activity of 1 was discovered as a
result of ethnobotanical studies on the island of Savai’i, Samoa,
where traditional healers use the bark of Homalanthus nutans (G.
Forst.) Guill. (Euphorbiaceae), a small rain-forest tree called
“mamala”, to treat hepatitis.
1-3 Permission was granted by healers,
village chiefs, and the Samoan government to bring samples of
stemwood and healer potions to the Natural Products Branch at
the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) for testing. Potent
cytoprotective activity against HIV-1 infection was detected in an
in vitro tetrazolium-based assay.
4
Bioassay-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of pros-
tratin (1), a tigliane diterpene, from both healer infusions and
organic extracts of stem tissue.
4 The compound was not novel,
having been previously isolated from Pimelea prostrata (J. R. Forst.
& G. Forst.) Willd. (Thymelaeaceae).
5 The NCI team found that
low concentrations of 1, from 0.1 to >25 µM, protected T-
lymphoblastoid CEM-SS and C-8166 cells from the lethal effects
of HIV-1 and inhibited viral replication in these cell lines.
Compound 1 also demonstrated cytoprotective activity in the human
monocytic cell line U937 and in freshly isolated human monocyte/
macrophage cultures.
4,6 Prostratin was found to bind to and activate
protein kinase C in vitro in CEM-SS cells.
4 Unlike other known
phorbol esters, however, 1 has proved not to be a tumor promoter
and has actually been shown to be a potent antitumor promoter.
15,16
Mechanisms involved in the mediation of protein kinase C
activity
7-11 as well as other biological activities
12-14 of 1 continue
to be studied. Recent studies conﬁrm that 1 is highly potent against
HIV infectivity and that this compound has a high in vitro
therapeutic index.
17
Interest in using prostratin (1) to help expose latent viral
reservoirs within the body was increased when this compound was
found to be a potent activator of HIV replication and expression in
cells latently infected with HIV-1.
18-22 Latently infected cell
reservoirs are currently the major obstacle to viral eradication,
23
even in patients whose plasma viral load is so low as to be
undetectable. In an in vitro model, 1 plus interferon has been shown
to eliminate 70-80% of latently infected cells.
20 Given the
ethnobotanical provenance, its use for centuries among the Samoan
people, and its potency in activating latent viral reservoirs, 1 is
now a candidate for immediate further research and development
for treatment of HIV/AIDS as adjuvant therapy. Hopefully, this
can be combined with a protease inhibitor and/or reverse-tran-
scriptase inhibitor, in an effort to expose and eliminate all viral
reservoirs in the body.
24
The AIDS Research Alliance in West Hollywood, California
(ARA) has been granted by the NCI the worldwide license for the
use of prostratin (1) for HIV infection, after ﬁrst negotiating an
equitable return of beneﬁts to the Samoan people as required by
NCI.
2 In conjunction with various collaborators, ARA has con-
ducted preliminary pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and toxico-
logical studies of 1. The organization is in the process of ﬁling an
initial new drug (IND) application to facilitate initiation of phase
I human clinical trials with 1 for treatment of HIV/AIDS. The
preclinical work has been performed with semisynthetic reagent
grade 1, which is extremely expensive if purchased from a
commercial supplier that is not a Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP) facility. ARA is seeking a supply of GMP prostratin for
use in further studies and to demonstrate to potential late-stage
pharmaceutical development companies that a long-term large-scale
supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) can be produced
for sales and distribution. In addition, as part of the beneﬁt-sharing
agreement with Samoa, ARA has promised to make every possible
effort to use Homalanthus trees from Samoa as a commercial
source. The Samoan government therefore wishes to develop a
Homalanthus industry in Samoa, based at the village level.
The identiﬁcation of H. nutans plants with extraordinarily high
levels of prostratin (1) will be vital to the efforts of the Samoan
government in selecting genotypes suitable for subsequent cultiva-

identiﬁcation of H. nutans plants with extremely low levels of 1
will be important for genetic engineering purposes, which may lead
to the discovery of variants or inactive forms of the prostratin gene
sequence and the eventual production of low-cost drug through
prokaryotic culturing.
25,26 We have developed and validated an
assay to rapidly assess 1 content and have evaluated four natural
Samoan populations of H. nutans. Studies of variability in bioactive
molecule concentration potentially could play an increasingly
important role in the commercial creation de novo of sustainable
pharmaceutical industries based on other pharmacologically active
compounds from wild plants.
Signiﬁcant variability in prostratin (1) concentrations was found
between H. nutans individuals and between populations collected
in Samoa. The median concentration of 1 for H. nutans stem
samples was 3.49 µg/g with a lower 95% conﬁdence limit of 2.28
µg/g and an upper 95% conﬁdence limit of 10.78 µg/g; any plants
below or above these limits were regarded as exceptional (Table
1). A Kruskal-Wallis H test allowed rejection of the null
hypothesis: Ho ) the median prostratin (1) concentrations of all
populations are equal (H ) 8.31, df ) 3, p < 0.05). Chi-square
analysis revealed that occurrence of exceptionally high concentration
plants was signiﬁcantly different between populations ( 2 ) 7.96,
df ) 3, p < 0.05) and allowed rejection of the null hypothesis: Ho
) the Falealupo population does not have a higher than expected
number of exceptionally high-yielding prostratin plants ( 2 ) 3.87,
df ) 1, p < 0.05). Thus, the Falealupo peninsula of Savai’i, Samoa,
with the highest median prostratin concentration (11.02 µg/g) and
the greatest number of exceptionally high 1-containing plants, is
likely the best population to search for more high-yielding cultivars
of H. nutans. However, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis
for Tafua ( 2 ) 1.14, df ) 1, p ) 0.275) or Tutuila ( 2 ) 0.894,
df ) 1, p ) 0.330) populations, having a greater than expected
number of exceptionally low 1-containing plants.
Prostratin (1) concentration and diameter of the tree at breast
height (DBH) were not signiﬁcantly correlated (Spearman’s rank
correlation coefﬁcient, rs )- 0.236). A Kruksal-Wallis H test did
not allow rejection of the null hypothesis: Ho ) the median
prostratin concentrations of all plant parts are equal (H ) 2.69, df
) 2). The Spearman rank correlation showed a strong positive
correlation between 1 concentrations in the stem and leafy branches
(rs ) 0.783, p < 0.05) as well as in stem and root tissues (rs )
0.825, p < 0.05) of the same plant. The general pattern shows higher
concentrations of 1 in the stem than in the leafy shoots or in the
roots (Table 2), which is consistent with the use of the inner bark
by indigenous Samoan healers. The Spearman’s rank correlation
conﬁrms that plants with exceptionally high stem concentration
(such as number 1865) also have relatively higher concentrations
in the leafy branches and roots. This suggests that if collection
number 1865 were to be developed as a commercial cultivar, both
the above-ground and below-ground portions of the plant could be
harvested for commercial production of prostratin (1).
With prostratin (1) poised for phase I clinical trials, procuring a
consistent long-term supply of GMP prepared compound is es-
sential. The recent elegant synthesis of prostratin by Wender et
al.
27 will likely help alleviate this problem, but ARA’s license
agreement requires that every effort be made to source 1 from
Samoa. The prostratin content in various plant parts from four
populations of H. nutans ranged from 0.20 to 52.69 µg/g, or over
a 100-fold difference, which suggests that cultivars should be
selected carefully. Knowing the range of variability in the content
of 1 will allow the Samoan government, which intends to initiate
an agricultural enterprise based on H. nutans, to target populations
with the best probability of yielding genotypes with exceptionally
high prostratin concentration and to ascertain a speciﬁc plant’s
viability as an agricultural cultivar. Development and validation
of a robust replicable method of determining concentrations of 1
will be important in creating an initial GMP supply of the molecule
for upcoming human clinical trials, as well as in the establishment
of a possible resultant Homalanthus industry for Samoa.
Variability in prostratin (1) content in wild populations is also
important for genetic engineering applications. A team led by
Keasling at the University of California-Berkeley has developed
techniques to transfer genes from different organisms into a
prokaryote model to economically produce pharmaceutical mol-
ecules of interest.
28 Advances in this ﬁeld could revolutionize
commercial development of bioactive molecules from plants and
facilitate efﬁcient inclusion of compounds from indigenous medicine
in the modern allopathic drug arsenal. Such approaches are
important even though natural product development is at a nadir
due to industry decisions to reallocate resources in the search for
lead compounds toward combinatorial libraries, an area of clarity
in regard to intellectual property. However, it is increasingly clear
that combinatorial chemistry has not met its promise. An NCI team
found that 61% of the 877 new small molecules introduced as drugs
worldwide during 1981-2002 can be traced to natural products;
the same team could not identify a single de novo combinatorial
compound approved as a drug during the same time frame.
29 Now,
with the drug discovery pipeline largely empty, molecules with a
long history of human use seem alluring and perhaps the wisdom
of natural products drug discovery will be revisited.
30
The provenance of natural product drugs can often be traced to
ethnobotanical research, as was the discovery of the antiviral

do not present an insurmountable obstacle to commercial develop-
ment. As shown in the case of 1, the need to meet the requirements
of paragraph 8(j) of the Convention on Biodiversity for equitable
sharing of beneﬁts can be resolved ethically.
2,31 A new paradigm
for drug research may emerge that incorporates willingness to
negotiate fair agreements for natural products collected in foreign
countries while meeting practical concerns, such as establishing
stable supplies, using technological and methodological innova-
tions.
32 Studies of variability in concentrations of bioactive
molecules in plants may play an important role in efﬁcient
commercial creation of future phytopharmaceutical industries.
Experimental Section
Plant Material. Samples of stem, root, and leafy branches preserved
in 70% ethanol were collected from a population near Saipipi, Savai’i,
Samoa. A healer preparation from Falealupo was also collected during
the same expedition to Samoa in April 2004. Prostratin (1) was detected
in each sample, and these materials were used for method development
and validation. Another collecting expedition was made to the island
of Savai’i, Samoa, in January 2005. Thirty-six samples, consisting of
vouchers and ethanol-preserved pharmaceutical grade collections, were
taken from three natural populations near the villages of Saipipi, Tafua,
and Falealupo. Six trees were sampled from each population, and GPS
coordinates, elevation, DBH, height, petiole color, and surrounding
vegetation were recorded for each tree sampled. From three plants at
each site three different morphological samples were collected: roots
(bark + wood), stem (bark + wood), and leafy branches, with fruit
and/or ﬂowers if present. Only stem samples were collected from the
other three trees at each site for a total of 12 samples per site. Nine
stem samples were collected on additional expeditions to the island of
Tutuila in American Samoa in May and November of 2005 for a total
of 45 samples including 27 stemwood samples. Samples were shipped
in vacuum-sealed aluminum vessels in 70% ethanol (except for the
Tutuila island collections, which were shipped in 70% 2-propanol).
The alcohol fractions were separated and the plant material air-dried
in a fume hood. Vouchers were deposited at the herbarium of the
California State University Fullerton’s Department of Biological
Science.
HPLC Analysis. Plant material was ﬁnely chopped then pulverized
with a coffee grinder, and approximately1go fd r ysample tissue was
suspended in 25 mL of acetone in a 55 °C bath for 10 min. Acetone
extracts were ﬁltered using a Whatman no. 4 disk, dried in a Savant
AES1000 Speedvac, suspended in 500 µL of 80% ethanol in HPLC
grade water, and then ﬁltered with a 0.22 µm Millipore Ultrafree MC
centrifugal ﬁlter device. Nontarget organics were removed from the
alcohol fraction with a Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridge using reversed-
phase elution (conditioning: sequential washes of 5 mL of 52%
acetonitrile, 5 mL of 26% acetonitrile, and 2.5 mL of 100% HPLC
water; loading: 100 µL of sample; separation: 1 mL of HPLC water,
2.5 mL of 26% acetonitrile, and 2.5 mL of 40% acetonitrile); the last
fraction was ﬁltered with a 0.22 µm Ultrafree MC centrifugal ﬁlter,
dried, and suspended in 40 µL of 80% ethanol for injection. The ethanol
or 2-propanol fractions and the acetone extract for each of 45 samples
were analyzed by HPLC in triplicate to measure prostratin (1)
concentration in µg per g. Prostratin was separated by reversed-phase
elution using a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column, 4 µm bead, 300 × 3.9
mm, on a gradient HPLC system (Waters 717 automated injector,
Waters 1525 binary solvent delivery system, and Empower data analysis
system) at 30 °C. Identiﬁcation was using a Waters 2487 dual-
wavelength UV absorbance detector using an authenticated standard
(ICN MP Biomedicals) at 254 nm. Aliquots of 10 µL of each sample
were injected, eluted over 15 min with a linear gradient mixing from
32% to 40% acetonitrile using ﬁltered and degassed HPLC grade water
(Fisher) and HPLC grade acetonitrile (Sigma Chromasolv), with a ﬂow
of 1.0 mL/min.
Method validation was completed in compliance with the speciﬁca-
tions in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), General Chapter
1225,
33 and Meyer.
34 Ruggedness was evaluated by calculating the
precision of biweekly triplicate injections at one concentration during
the entire range of the study (RSD 5.21%). Linearity was evaluated by
plotting peak area as a function of analyte concentration, and regression
analysis was performed: slope ) 207.78; intercept )- 1468.70;
correlationcoefﬁcient)0.9997;residualsumofsquares)716 109 646.17.
The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were
determined as 2.5 and 25 pmol, respectively, with a range to 30 nmol.
Accuracy (recovery ) 96%) was calculated by spiking blank matrix
with known amounts of 1 in triplicate at ﬁve concentrations. Precision
was evaluated using repeatability and intermediate precision. Repeat-
ability was assessed with triplicate injections at ﬁve concentrations on
two consecutive days (RSD 1.81%). Intermediate precision was
calculated biweekly over the range of the study with triplicate injections
at three concentrations (RSD 5.87%).
Since these data were not normally distributed, nonparametric
statistics were employed. The observed concentrations of 1 were ranked,
and 95% conﬁdence limits for the distribution of these concentrations
around the median were constructed using eq 8.2.2 in Snedecor and
Cochran.
35
To determine if the median prostratin (1) concentrations of all
populations were equal, statistical hypotheses were tested using a
Kruksal-Wallis H test, the nonparametric analogue of ANOVA. The
resultant H statistic was tested for statistical signiﬁcance at the p <
0.05 level using standard  2 tables. A chi-square test for independence
was employed to ascertain if the occurrence of exceptionally high
concentration plants was equal between populations and also to
determine if the Falealupo population had a greater than expected
number of exceptionally high-yielding prostratin plants. We used a
similar chi-square procedure to test the Tafua and Tutuila populations
to see if they had a higher than expected number of exceptionally low-
yielding 1 plants. Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient was calculated
to assess the correlation between prostratin concentration and diameter
at breast height (DBH). A Kruskal-Wallis H test was employed to
establish if 1 was equally distributed throughout plant parts (leafy
branches, stem, and root); to determine if plants with high stem
concentrations also have high concentrations in the leaf or roots, we
calculated a Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient and tested for
signiﬁcant correlation at the p < 0.05 level.
