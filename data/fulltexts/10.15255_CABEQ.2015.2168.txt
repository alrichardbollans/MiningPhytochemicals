Introduction
Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) is a popular herb 
which is native to the Mediterranean region and 
cultivated worldwide. Sage is an important source 
of antioxidants used as preservatives and has wider 
implications for the dietary intake of natural antiox-
idants.1,2 This antioxidant effect has been attributed 
to the main phenolic components, caffeic acid di-
mer – rosmarinic acid1 and flavonoids, being mostly 
present as flavones and their glycosides. Flavone 
glycosides are apparently common in sage, and 
most of them are flavones 7-glycosides represented 
by apigenin and luteolin 7-glucoside and their cor-
responding 3- and 7-glucuronides.2 In the last few 
decades, research regarding the extraction of pheno-
lic compounds found in plants have attracted spe-
cial interest regarding their application in the food 
industry. Extraction is a very important step in the 
isolation, identification, and use of polyphenols.3 
The conventional extraction methods, which have 
been employed for decades, require prolonged ex-
traction times and relatively larger quantities of sol-
vent.4,5 Therefore, various novel extraction tech-
niques have been developed for the extraction of 
bioactive compounds from herbs, including ultra-
sound-assisted extraction,6–8 microwave-assisted ex-
traction,9 supercritical fluid extraction.10 Ultra-
sound-assisted extraction is an upcoming extraction 
technique that can offer high reproducibility in 
shorter time, higher yields of bioactive compounds, 
simplified manipulation, decreased temperature 
during processing, reduced solvent consumption, 
and lower energy input.11–13 In our previous paper,5 
the influence of solvent polarity and composition, 
time and temperature of conventional extraction on 
mass fraction of polyphenols from sage were re-
searched. The mixtures of ethanol and water are 
possibly the most suitable solvents for the extraction 
of sage due to different polarities of the active con-
stituents, and acceptability of this solvent system 
for human consumption.4,5 Albu et al.3 and Sališova 
et al.14 have investigated the difference in the appli-
cation of conventional extraction and ultrasonic-as-
sisted extraction on the concentration of biological-
ly active compounds in sage. They concluded that 
the content of biologically active compounds is ap-
proximately 60 % higher under the influence of ul-
trasound. Rosmarinic acid is the more active of 
these antioxidants, but it is relatively easily degrad-
ed in solvent and the rate of degradation is sol-
vent-dependant.6 The ultrasonic-assisted extraction 
has been widely used for obtaining polyphenols 
from plants using ethanol, mixture of ethanol/wa-

An innovative ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is the rapid non-thermal ex-
traction technique, which in comparison to conventional extraction (CE), offers high re-
producibility in a short time with simplified manipulation, reduced solvent consumption 
and lower energy. Optimization of ultrasonic conditions was conducted for devices with 
nominal output power of 100 and 400 W, including the influence of geometrical param-
eters of probes regarding ultrasound-assisted extraction. The results showed that the op-
timal parameters for extraction of total phenols and rosmarinic acid as a dominant com-
pound in sage extracts were as follows: solvent: 30 % ethanol, extraction duration of 11 
minutes, and ultrasonic device output power of 400 W. The antioxidant capacity of the 
obtained extract correlated with the concentration of total phenols and flavonoids, and 
among individual phenols the rosmarinic acid contributed the most to the antioxidant 
capacity. The achieved results and statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05) have shown how UAE 
resulted in shorter extraction time, and increased extraction capacity of phenolic com-
pounds by using solvents with a less amount of organic phase.

ter,3,15–19 water and acetone.17 Ultrasound-assisted 
extraction can also provide the opportunity for en-
hanced extraction of heat-sensitive bioactive com-
ponents at lower processing temperatures15, and is a 
more effective technique than conventional thermal 
extraction with most of the plants extracted within 
15 minutes.3 The mechanism of ultrasound in liq-
uids relies on the mechanical effect caused by the 
implosion of cavitational bubbles. During implo-
sion of micro-sized cavitational bubbles, strong 
shear forces are created, while both high pressures 
and temperatures generated as a consequence of the 
bursting bubbles, cause rapid plant tissue disruption 
allowing cellular material release and improved 
mass transfer as well. An important part of ultra-
sound-assisted processing is overall optimization of 
the process. The frequency (kHz), amplitude (%), 
applied cycle (%), nominal output power (W), and 
geometrical parameters of the sonotrode (length and 
diameter – mm) should be carefully prepared and 
taken into consideration.20–22 The choice of method 
for the extraction of polyphenols from sage depends 
on the type of compounds to be extracted, and is 
found to be dependent on the solvent employed. 
From literature data,3 extraction of polyphenols us-
ing polar solvents is significantly improved by son-
ication. It is important to note that extraction time is 
significantly shortened with the use of ultrasound.
The aim of this study was to examine and com-
pare CE and UAE of sage leaves (Salvia officinalis 
L.). The research was carried out in two steps: in 
the first step, conventional extraction and ultra-
sound-assisted extraction with 30 % ethanol, and 
setting of the optimum conditions for each method. 
In second step, the extraction was carried out with 
different solvents (30 % acetone and water) under 
optimal conditions for each method set in the first 
step. The effects of the extraction parameters: sol-
vents polarity (water, 30 % ethanol and acetone) on 
extraction methods, extraction time (20, 30, 40 min) 
and temperature (40, 50, 60 °C) for CE, and the in-
fluence of different ultrasonic devices (100 and 400 
W) and extraction time (8 to 12 min) for UAE, with 
respect to the amount of extracted polyphenols were 
investigated. The influence and relevance of the op-
erating parameters required during the extractions 
were checked and evaluated using a response sur-
face methodology studying phenolic content. The 
analysis of individual polyphenols of the extracts 
was made by HPLC with UV/PDA detection.
Material and methods
Chemicals and reagents
Ethanol, sodium carbonate, and sodium nitrite 
were purchased from Gram–mol Company (Zagreb, 
Croatia). Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, apigenin-7-gluco-
side, luteolin-3-glucoside, rosmarinic, caffeic, gal-
lic, vanillic and syringic acid were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich company (Steinheim, Germany). 
Acetone was purchased from Kemika Company 
(Zagreb, Croatia). Methanol (HPLC grade) was 
purchased from J.T. Baker Company (Deventer, the 
Netherlands).
Material
The plant material (sage) was collected on the 
Island of Pag (Croatia) in July 2008. The leaves of 
sage (Salvia officinalis L.) were dried immediately 
after harvesting in a shady and well-aired place for 
two weeks. Thereupon, the dried leaves were packed 
in paper bags, sealed, and kept in a dark, dry and 
cool place. Before use, the dry leaves were crushed 
using a house blender (Mixy, Zepter International).
Extraction of polyphenols
Conventional extraction was performed in a 
water bath shaker (Memmert WB14, SV1422, 
Schwabach, Germany). The crushed dried sage 
leaves (1 g) were weighed into a 100 mL glass cup, 
dissolved in 30 % ethanol (20 mL) and extracted in 
a water bath at 40, 50 and 60 °C for 20, 30 and 40 
minutes. Further extraction experiments were per-
formed with 30 % acetone and pure distilled water 
under optimal extraction conditions (60 °C, 30 min). 
After the extraction, the flask was removed from 
the bath and cooled to room temperature with cool-
ing water. The extracts were filtered through What-
man no. 40 filter paper (Whatman International 
Ltd., Kent, UK) using a Büchner funnel, and the 
filtrates were adjusted to 25 mL in volumetric flasks 
with appropriate organic solvent or distilled water. 
The extracts were stored at –18 °C until analyses 
(no more than 7 days).
Ultrasound-assisted extraction experiments 
were carried out with 2 different ultrasonic devices 
with maximal power of 100 W and 400 W under 
maximal working amplitude equal to 100 % of 
maximum nominal output power of the device. The 
ultrasonic devices were manufactured by “Dr 
Hielscher”, Teltow, Germany). The frequency was 
constant at 24 kHz for 100 W, and 30 kHz for 400 
W ultrasonic devices, and enabled transient cavita-
tions with bubbles implosion effect. The device was 
working throughout the experiment in continuous 
mode, i.e. cycle = 1, which means how the ultra-
sound was propagated in 100 % of the time through-
out the medium. As previously mentioned for pro-
cess optimization, two different ultrasonic devices 
were used to determine appropriate sonotrode for 
the used volume of the sample. The setup was not 
cooled down. The reason for this was to obtain the

best yield in a shorter processing time without addi-
tional energy consumption for cooling using ultra-
sonic in comparison with conventional extraction. 
The crushed dried sage leaves (1 g) were weighed 
into a 100 mL glass cup, dissolved in 30 % ethanol 
(20 mL), and directly sonicated. The extrinsic pa-
rameters of extraction time (8, 10, 11, 12 min) and 
the ultrasonic device (100 and 400 W) were varied. 
The ultrasonic probe was immersed into the mixture 
directly. Further extraction experiments were per-
formed with 30 % acetone and pure distilled water 
under optimal extraction time of 11 minutes. The 
temperature was in the range of 21.8 to 88.0 °C. 
After extraction, the extracts were filtered through 
Whatman no. 40 filter paper (Whatman Internation-
al Ltd., Kent, UK) using a Büchner funnel, and the 
filtrates were adjusted to 25 mL in a volumetric flask 
with appropriate organic solvent or distilled water.
The obtained polyphenolic extracts (CE and 
UAE extraction) were used for determination of to-
tal phenols, flavonoids, antioxidant capacity spec-
trophotometrically, and individual phenols using 
HPLC coupled with UV/PDA detector. All treat-
ments were carried out in triplicate.
Determination of total phenols (TP)
The total phenols content of the extracts ob-
tained by both conventional extraction and ultra-
sound-assisted extraction were determined by a 
modified spectrophotometric method using Fo-
lin-Ciocalteu reagent, calibrated against rosmarinic 
acid as the reference standard.23 Quantification of 
total phenols was made by using the calibration 
curve of rosmarinic acid, which was prepared by di-
luting the stock standard with the extraction sol-
vents to yield 50 to 500 mg per L of TP. The results 
were calculated according to the calibration curve 
for rosmarinic acid and the mass fraction of total 
phenols, derived from triplicate analyses and ex-
pressed as mg of rosmarinic acid equivalents (RA) 
per 100 g dry matter (dm).
Determination of flavonoids (FL)
Flavonoid compounds were determined from 
the same extracted samples that were used for de-
termination of total phenolic content. The flavo-
noids were determined by a modified photometric 
method using AlCl
3,
24 calibrated against rutin as the 
reference standard. Quantification of flavonoids 
was made by using the calibration curve of rutin, 
which was prepared by diluting the stock standard 
with the extraction solvents to yield 50 to 250 mg 
per 100 mL of flavonoids. The results were calcu-
lated according to the calibration curve for rutin and 
the mass fraction of flavonoids, derived from tripli-
cate analyses and expressed as mg of rutin equiva-
lents per 100 g dry matter (dm).
DPPH radical-scavenging activity
The DPPH radical-scavenging activity was de-
termined using the method proposed by Brand-Wil-
liams et al.25 Briefly, 1 mL of phenolic extracts was 
added to 1 mL of DPPH methanolic solution (0.5 
mmol L–1 ) with 3 mL of methanol. The mixture 
was shaken vigorously and allowed to stand at room 
temperature in the dark for 20 minutes. Absorbance 
was measured at 517 nm. Methanol was used to ad-
just zero and DPPH methanol solution as a refer-
ence sample. The results were corrected for dilution 
and expressed in mmol trolox equivalents per kg. 
All determinations were performed in triplicate.
HPLC analysis
Separation of sage phenols was performed by 
HPLC analysis, using a Varian Pro Star System 
(Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US) 
equipped with a ProStar 230 solvent delivery sys-
tem, Rheodyne® 7125 injector and Pro Star 330 
UV-photo diode array detector. Chromatographic 
separation was performed on a Zorbax ODS column 
(250 x 4.6 mm i.d. 5 mm; Agilent Technologies). 
The composition of solvents and gradient elution 
conditions had previously been described by Fecka 
et al.26 with modification of formic acid in mobile 
phases. The mobile phase was composed of solvent 
A (3 % formic acid in acetonitrile) and solvent B 
(3 % formic acid in water). The following gradient 
was carried out: 10 % A in B, rising to 40 % A after 
25 minutes, to 70 % A after 30 minutes, and then to 
10 % A after 35 minutes. The flow rate was kept 
constant at 0.9 mL per minute for a total run time of 
35 minutes. The injection volume for all the sam-
ples was 20 µL. The extracts were filtered through 
a 0.45 µL diameter membrane filter prior to analy-
sis. The detection wavelength of 278 nm was used 
for the detection of phenolic acids. Flavones glyco-
sides were detected at 360 nm. Identification of the 
compounds was achieved by comparing their reten-
tion times and UV-VIS spectra with those of au-
thenticated standards. Phenolic compounds were 
separated in a series of descending polarity, based 
on the comparison of their retention time and reten-
tion time of the standards, and based on a compari-
son of typical UV spectra. Quantitative determina-
tions were carried out using the calibration curves 
of the standards. Phenolic acids (rosmarinic, caffe-
ic, vanillic and syringic) and flavonoids (luteo-
lin-3-glucoside and apigenin-7-glucoside) were 
used as standards. Calibration curves of the pheno-
lic acids and flavone glycosides standards were 
made by diluting stock standards (concentration of

0.5 to 2.0 mg per mL) in extraction solvents (etha-
nol, acetone or water) to yield 0.001– 0.020 mg per 
mL. Mass fractions of phenolic compounds were 
calculated from the calibration curves of phenolic 
acids and flavones glycosides, and expressed as mg 
of phenolic acid or flavones glycosides equivalent 
per 100 g dry matter. The values were expressed as 
means (N = 3) ± S.D. Salvianolic K and salvianolic 
I acids and methyl rosmarinate were quantified as 
equivalents of rosmarinic acid. Flavone glycosides 
6-hydroxyluteolin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucuron-
ide and luteolin-3-glucuronide were quantified as 
equivalents of luteolin-3-glucoside and apigen-
in-7-glucuronide as the equivalent of apigen-
in-7-glucoside.
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as means (N = 3) ± 
standard deviations (S.D.) of triplicate measure-
ments and analysed by software (Statistica 12.0). 
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)27,28 was 
carried out on the significant differences between 
the extraction methods and the solvents used. Two 
different extraction methods were examined. The 
effects of solvent extraction conditions (extraction 
solvent, extraction time and temperature, power of 
ultrasonic devices) were investigated. Differences 
were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.
Results and discussion
In the first step of this study, two methods 
(conventional and ultrasound-assisted extraction) 
were used to extract polyphenols from sage under 
the previously described conditions. Table 1 shows 
the extraction capacity of conventional extraction 
for total phenols, flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, 
and quantification results of phenolic acids and fla-
vonoids. Two variables influencing the extraction 
were investigated by means of the conventional 
process, which are extraction temperature (40, 50, 
60 °C) and time (20, 30, 40 min). In the further ex-
periments, chosen were temperatures below 60 °C 
and shorter extraction times up to 40 minutes, be-
cause higher temperatures may be attributed to ther-
mal degradation of polyphenols.5 Studying the ex-
traction time (20, 30, 40 min), it was observed that 
the mass fraction of the extracted phenols slightly

Content of phenolic acids and flavone glycosides are expressed as mg per 100 g of dry sage; the sum of hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic acid, salvianolic K and I acids, methyl rosmarinat); the sum of hydroxybenzoic acids (vanillic and syringic acids); Luteolin 
glycosides (6-hydroxyluteolin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucuronide, luteolin-7-glucoside, luteolin-3-glucuronide); Apigenin glycosides 
(apigenin-7-glucuronide, apigenin-7-glucoside).

increased at 30 minutes, and a decrease at longer 
times of extraction (40 min) at all temperatures. The 
results of quantification are shown individually for 
rosmarinic acid as it was the most abundant com-
pound in the sage extracts, while the results for oth-
er identified phenolic acids are shown as the sum of 
hydroxycinammic acids (caffeic, salvianolic K and 
I acids, methyl rosmarinate) and hydroxybenzoic 
acids (vanillic and syringic acids) because they 
were present in very low mass fractions. Also, the 
results of quantification of flavonoids are expressed 
as the sum of luteolin glycosides (6-hydroxyluteo-
lin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucuronide, luteolin-7 -
glucoside, luteolin-3-glucuronide) and api ge nin gly-
cosides (apigenin-7-glucuronide, api ge nin-7-glu coside), 
because some of them were present in low mass 
fractions. As can be observed from the results ob-
tained by conventional extraction, temperature also 
has a great impact on the extraction of rosmarinic, 
hydroxybenzoic acids, and flavone glycosides. A 
temperature increase from 40 to 60 °C had signifi-
cantly increased the extraction efficiency in conven-
tional extraction (Table 1). When extraction tem-
perature rose to 60 °C, the mass fraction of phenolic 
acids and flavone glycosides decreased with in-
creased extraction time (30 to 40 min). We suggest 
that the extraction temperature in the extraction of 
sage phenols by conventional extraction in a water 
bath should not exceed 60 °C. As already discussed, 
the obtained results and the results previously de-
scribed5 lead us to conclude that the extraction ca-
pacity decreases at higher temperatures. The reduc-
tion in yields of extracted phenolics at times longer 
than 30 minutes and higher temperatures may prob-
ably be attributed to the thermal degradation and 
polymerization reaction occurring due to the combi-
nation of various phenols among themselves, hav-
ing an effect on the analytical quantification.29 Tak-
ing into account these facts, temperature (60 °C) 
and extraction time (30 min) were selected as the 
optimum.
For the ultrasound-assisted extraction, the nom-
inal output power of ultrasonic device with different 
frequencies (24 and 30 kHz) and the nominal output 
powers (100 and 400 W) with duration of extraction 
(8, 10, 11, 12 min) parameters were optimized. The 
influence of sonication time ranging from 8, 10, 11 
to 12 minutes on total phenols and flavonoids mass 
fraction is shown in Table 2. Our obtained results 
showed that phenols recovery increased with the 
time of sonication, reaching a maximum at 11 min-
utes for the sage total phenols and flavonoids anal-
ysed. The extraction efficiencies were lower during 
first 8 minutes of sonication, indicating that more 
time of ultrasound propagation was required for cell 
walls disruption releasing phenols from the cell 
constituents. Longer sonication times of 10 and 11 
minutes improved extraction efficiencies and hence 
increased the rate of extraction, while prolonged ap-
plication of 12 minutes did not increase the mass 
fraction of total phenols and flavonoids to a larger 
extent. The highest extraction capacity was reached 
by extraction time of 11 minutes, regardless of the 
ultrasonic devices (100 and 400 W). The highest 
mass fraction of TP (7813.69 mg RA/100 g) with 
Folin-Ciocalteu method was obtained with the fol-
lowing parameters of ultrasonic extraction: device 
output power of 100 W, sonication times of 11 min-
utes, while the highest value was not confirmed 
with conducted HPLC analysis. Considering the 
above-mentioned, this may have been due to the 
non-phenolic components in the extract reacting 
with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Longer sonication 
times of 10 and 20 minutes improved extraction ef-
ficiencies, and hence increased the rate of ex-
traction, while prolonged application of 30 minutes 
did not benefit greatly in phenol yields. When com-
pared to 30 minutes of extraction, more than 60 % 
phenolics were extracted in the first 10 minutes. 
The time increases up to 10 minutes provoked an 
almost linear rise in total phenols yields, suggesting 
that maximum recovery was already attained before 
10 minutes.7,13 Statistical evaluation (ANOVA) con-
firmed that phenol extraction yields were not highly 
time-dependent (p ≥ 0.05) (Table 2). The positive 
effect on the extraction yield of phenolic acids and 
flavone glycosides was observed with the increase 
in ultrasonic power. The extraction yield of pheno-
lic acids and flavone glycosides increased, but not 
significantly (p ≥ 0.05). The mass fraction of ros-
marinic acid was much higher than the others, and 
had an obvious increasing trend from 100 to 400 W. 
The total value of phenolic acids and flavone glyco-
sides of ethanol extract to the extraction time of 11 
minutes with 400 W ultrasonic devices was ob-
tained in higher mass fraction than using the 100 W 
devices. The achieved results and the conducted sta-
tistical analysis suggested that the extraction time 
influenced statistically significantly the extraction 
of phenolic compounds from sage up to 11 minutes, 
while after that time, a decrease occurred (p ≥ 0.05) 
(Table 2). Prolonged extraction time (8, 10 and 11 
min) resulted in increased extraction capacity of 
rosmarinic acid isolation but also of other phenolic 
acids and flavone glycosides.
When compared to 30 minutes of conventional 
extraction at 60 °C, most of the polyphenols were 
extracted in the first 11 minutes. Direct sonication 
with a probe was more efficient than conventional 
extraction for sage. Generally, in a directly sonicated 
system, the energy of the probe unit is directly fo-
cused on a localized sample zone, thereby providing 
more efficient cavitation into the treated solution.30–32 
It is important to note that by using ultrasound, the 
480 M. DENT et al., Comparison of Conventional and Ultrasound-assisted Extraction…, Chem. Biochem. Eng. Q., 29 (3) 475–484 (2015)
extraction time was significantly shortened compared 
to conventional extraction. Based on the results from 
the first step of this research, optimal extraction con-
ditions were defined for optimal extraction condi-
tions for both extraction methods. Optimisation of 
the extraction procedure was based on total and indi-
vidual phenols. The optimal extraction conditions se-
lected were as follows: 11 minutes of extraction time 
with 400 W device, and 30 minutes in water bath at 
60 °C with conventional extraction.
In the second step, the extraction was carried 
out at optimal processing conditions with the other 
two solvents (30 % acetone and water). Ultra-
sound-assisted extraction (with 400 W device) in 
other solvents, 30 % acetone and water, in the same 
extraction conditions, obtained a somewhat lower 
mass fraction of TP, 30 % acetone (5202.88 mg 
RA/100 g), water (4284.64 mg RA/100 g). Table 3 
shows the total phenolic and flavonoid content of 
the three solvent extractions from sage. The differ-
ence in polarities of the extracting solvents might 
influence the solubility of the chemical constituents 
in a sample and its extraction yield. Therefore, in 
the selection of a solvent for optimizing the recov-
ery of total phenols and flavonoids from the sample, 
30 % ethanol exhibited the highest value of total 
phenols and flavonoids, hence was is considered as 
the most efficient solvent system for extracting phe-
nolic compounds from sage. The 30 % acetone ex-
tracts of sage leaves ranked next with no significant 
difference from the 30 % ethanol and water extracts 
(p ≥ 0.05, table 3). The highest extraction capacity 
were achieved by extraction with 30 % ethanol, and 
significantly less with 30 % acetone and water in 
the same extraction conditions. In the conventional 
extraction method, the choice of solvent extraction 
and extraction method had no significant impact on 
the mass fraction of total phenols and flavonoids 
(Table 3). After the photometric determination of 
total phenols, the extracted samples were subjected 
to HPLC UV/PDA analysis. The effect of these sol-
vent systems in extracting phenolic compounds 
from sage were quantitatively measured and com-
pared. Higher mass fractions of rosmarinic acid as 
the most represented compound in sage, were ex-
tracted by implementing 30 % ethanol than with (30 
% acetone and water) under same extraction condi-
tions. The statistical analysis showed how the sol-
vent used had no significant influence on the ex-
traction of rosmarinic acid (p ≥ 0.05) (Table 3).

In the extracts obtained by the probe system of 
400 W under optimal conditions, the mass fractions 
of all identified polyphenols were higher than in ex-
tracts obtained with the probe system of 100 W, and 
especially with regard to conventional extraction. 
Improvement was obtained using a 400 W probe sys-
tem. Here, additional stirring was not required since 
the probe itself provided sufficient mixing of the het-
erogeneous mixture. The mass fraction of rosmarinic 
acid was the highest in ethanol extracts (4160.31 
mg/100 g), followed by acetone (3937.13 mg/100 g), 
while it was the lowest in the water extracts (2654.14 
mg/100 g). Other phenolic acids were determined in 
higher mass fractions in ethanol extracts with regard 
to acetone and water extracts. Luteolin and apigenin 
glycosides were the highest in the ethanol extract, 
followed by acetone, and the lowest in the water ex-
tracts. The mass fractions of all identified phenols in 
the water extracts were low compared to ethanol and 
acetone extracts, although ultrasound enhanced the 
extraction, so the mass fractions of all identified phe-
nols were higher in ultrasound-assisted extraction 
than conventional extraction (Table 3). Statistical 
analysis showed a significant influence of the ex-
traction method and solvent on the amount of hy-
droxybenzoic acids and luteolin glycosides, while 
only the extraction solvent had a significant influence 
on the amount of hydroxycinamic acids (p ≤ 0.05, 
Table 3). Several studies have also revealed the effi-
ciency of ethanol and acetone water mixtures in ex-
tracting polyphenols from samples of plant materials. 
Ethanol is possibly a preferable solvent because of its 
nontoxic, environmentally safe and inexpensive fea-
tures, while acetone may lead to an unacceptable lev-
el of residue in the extracts.3,6,10 Therefore, ethanol 
and water are possibly the most suitable solvent sys-
tem for the extraction of sage due to the different po-
larities of the active constituents, and the acceptabil-
ity of this solvent system for human consumption.
By ultrasound-assisted extraction for 11 min-
utes, using 30 % ethanol, the mass fraction of TP 
(6775.52 mg RA/100 g) was 20 % higher than with 
conventional extraction for 30 minutes with the same 
solvent, TP (6399.79 mg RA/100 g). By using other 
extraction solvents (acetone and water), the mass 
fraction of TP was lower. Under ultrasonic extraction, 
ethanol showed a greater enhancement in the mass 
fraction of total phenols and flavonoids compared 
with acetone and water, which suggested it could be 
a viable solvent for extraction under these conditions. 
Sonication also appeared to reduce the dependence 
on the extraction solvent itself, with yields greatly 
enhanced when employing ethanol.3 From the results 
of individual phenols obtained, it appeared that 30 % 
ethanol was a better extraction solvent for rosmarinic 
acid under the conditions studied (Table 3). This is 
probably due to the more polar nature of rosmarinic 
acid favouring the more polar ethanol solvent. Wang 
et al.17 investigated the effect of extraction time on 
the content of rosmarinic acid using 30 % ethanol as 
the solvent. They found that 10 minutes of sonication 
was sufficient to extract the phenols. It was found 
that there was little difference using 30 % ethanol or

acetone as an extraction solvent, while the content of 
rosmarinic acid was about 20 % higher than with wa-
ter. With water alone as an extraction solvent, the 
content of rosmarinic acid was about 30 % lower 
than with the other solvents. From our results, water 
is not a good solvent for extracting phenols from 
sage, but it has been observed that the addition of 
small percentages of water to the extraction solvent 
helps increase the effectiveness of extraction of the 
analytes of interest from the sample.5 All the factors 
had positive effects on the rosmarinic acid content. 
Research results are in accordance with literature 
data stating that caffeic acid and their derivates,33 sal-
vianolic K and 5,9,34 sagerinic,1 caffeic acid,34–36 meth-
yl rosmarinate,26,37 play a central role in the composi-
tion of Lamiaceae. The content of free caffeic acid in 
our extracts was lower compared to syringic and es-
pecially rosmarinic acid. The results of our study 
showed that rosmarinic acid was present in all these 
sage extracts. Rosmarinic acid was the dominant 
compound, while other phenolics were present in 
significantly lower mass fractions. HPLC analysis 
showed higher mass fractions of phenolic acids and 
flavone glycosides in samples obtained by ultrasound 
than by conventional extraction under the same po-
larity of solvents with significant shortening of treat-
ment time (threefold).
In recent years, there have been several reports 
on the application of UAE in the isolation of various 
phenolic compounds from plant materials.3,13,14,16 The 
mass fractions of rosmarinic acid and other identified 
phenols in ethanol extracts obtained by applying ul-
trasonic-assisted extraction with directly immersed 
probe (output power of 400 W, 11 minutes) achieved 
about 20 % higher extraction capacity compared to 
conventional extraction in a water bath (60 °C, 30 
minutes). These results are consistent with studies of 
other authors.3,14 It is important to emphasise that ul-
trasound-assisted extraction shortened the extraction 
time threefold. During sonication, the cavitations 
process causes the swelling of cells or the breakdown 
of cell walls, which allows high diffusion rates across 
the cell wall in the first case, or a simple washing out 
of the cell contents in the second.15 Besides the sol-
vent, temperature and pressure, better recovery of 
cell contents can be obtained by optimising ultra-
sound application factors, including frequency, soni-
cation power and time, as well as ultrasonic wave 
disruption.11 Ultrasound as a technology and ultra-
sound-assisted extraction can be called an ″environ-
ment-friendly″ or ″green″ technique.19 Overall, ultra-
sound-assisted extraction of polyphenols by using 
food grade solvents has strong potential for its indus-
trial development as an efficient and environ-
ment-friendly process for preparation of extracts rich 
in natural antioxidants aimed at replacing synthetic 
antioxidants.16 UAE has been recognised for applica-
tion in industry to improve efficiency and reduce ex-
traction time.15
A good correlation was obtained between antiox-
idant properties of sage extracts and their total phenols 
content, while the sage extracts possessed higher radi-
cal scavenging ability for both extraction methods. 
The results obtained for flavonoids and DPPH assays 
showed a low degree of correlation. Tables 1 and 2 
show the linear correlation between the mass fraction 
of total phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant capacities 
of sage extracts obtained by different extraction tem-
perature and time. It can be concluded that increased 
temperature increased the antioxidant capacity of the 
sage extracts. This parallel relationship proves that the 
total phenol content directly affects the antioxidant ca-
pacity of sage extracts.
Conclusion
By applying different extraction methods, the ul-
trasound-assisted extraction employing an ultrasonic 
device with direct agitation, resulted in the highest 
recovery of total and individual polyphenols coupled 
with lower solvent consumption compared to con-
ventional extraction. Direct sonication with a probe 
system was more efficient than conventional ex-
traction. The energy of the probe unit was directly 
focused on a localised sample zone thereby provid-
ing efficient cavitations into the extracting solution. 
The values of polyphenols extracted with ultra-
sound-assisted extraction under optimal conditions 
(output power of 400 W, 11 minutes) using 30 % 
ethanol were 20 % higher than with conventional ex-
traction (60 °C, 30 min) with a meaningful (up to 
threefold) shortening of processing time. Improve-
ment of all identified polyphenols was obtained us-
ing a 400 W probe system under optimal conditions, 
especially relative to the probe system of 100 W. The 
results showed that rosmarinic acid was the dominant 
compound in the sage extracts, while other phenolics 
were present in significantly lower mass fractions. 
Total and individual polyphenols were determined in 
higher mass fractions in ethanol extracts relative to 
acetone and water extracts.
