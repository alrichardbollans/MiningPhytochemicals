Homogeneous enzyme preparations were obtained by a four-step procedure using am- monium sulfate fractionation, anion- and cation-exchange chro- matography, and substrate elution from a cellulose phosphate column. l h e  last step resulted in two well-separated adivities of about the same molecular weight. A 2000- to 3000-fold purifica- tion, with an overall recovery of one-fourth of the initial adivity, was achieved. Both EPSP synthase isoforms were characterized with respect to structural, kinetic, and biochemical properties. Only slight differences are seen in molecular mass, adivation energy, and apparent affinities for the two substrates. A more pronounced difference was found between their thermal inactivation rates. l w o  EPSP synthase isoforms were also elucidated in crude homogenates by anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. lhis al- lowed us to follow their expression during a culture growth cycle. One form was found at substantial levels throughout, whereas the other increased in exponentially growing cells and declined in late- logarithmic phase. l h e  analysis of highly purified plastid prepara- tions demonstratèd a plastidial localization of both proteins. Pos- sible functional roles for maize EPSP synthase isozymes, with regard to the dual-pathway hypothesis and to the recent findings on defense-related aromatic biosynthesis in higher plants, are discussed. The sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway leading to aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, EPSP synthase (3-phos- phoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyl transferase, EC 2.5.1.19), cat- alyzes the reversible addition of the enolpyruvyl moiety of PEP to S3P. EPSP synthase activity has been detected and studied in a number of organisms, and the enzyme has been purified from bacteria, fungi, and dicotyledonous plants. Among monocots, studies have been reported only for Sorghum bicolor (Ream et al., 1988). Interest in the characterization of plant EPSP synthase has been renewed since the enzyme has been identified as the target of the broad-spectrum postemergence herbicide gly- This work was supported by grants from Ministero Agricoltura e Foreste (national program 'Tecnologie Avanzate Applicate alle Piante," project No. 12) and from Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (grant No. 91.00536). * Corresponding author; fax 39-382-528496. phosate (Steinrücken and Amrhein, 1980). Glyphosate shows competitive inhibition for PEP and uncompetitive inhibition for S3P (Boocock and Coggins, 1983). Because EPSP synthase is absent in mammals, glyphosate has a very low toxicity for animals (Grossbard and Atkinson, 1985). The selection of mutant EPSP synthases or the isolation of naturally resistant enzymes and their transfer into the most widely cultivated crops should be of great agronomic value (Racchi, 1990). An intact complement of aromatic-pathway enzymes lead- ing to the production of amino acids needed for protein synthesis has been demonstrated within the plastids of higher plants (Bickel et al., 1978; Leuschner and Schultz, 1991). Aromatic amino acids are indeed required in the cytosol also, as precursors of a great variety of secondary metabolites (e.g. auxins, coumarins, flavonoids, lignins, folates, tannins, and alkaloids), so that the molecules from the shikimate pathway can account for up to 60% of the total plant dry weight (Haslam, 1974). In recent years, experimental evidence has been reported for an increasing number of plant species that supports the presence of distinct isozyme pairs with different subcellular localization (cytosolic and plastidial) for key branchpoint enzymes of aromatic biosynthesis (e.g. DAHP synthase [Ganson et al., 19861, shikimate dehydrogenase [Rothe et al., 19831, and anthranilate synthase and chorismate mutase [Poulsen and Veerporte, 19911). On this basis, the universal existence in higher plants of analogous prechoris- mate pathways located simultaneously in both cell compart- ments has been hypothesized (dual-pathway hypothesis of aromatic biosynthesis; Jensen, 1986; Hrazdina and Jensen, 1992). The cytosolic enzymes, being unregulated, are as- sumed to provide precursors for secondary metabolism by a simple overflow mechanism. However, the presence of cy- tosol-localized isoforms has been well established only for the above-mentioned enzymes, and further experimental re- sults are needed to confirm the existence of a complete extraplastidial shikimate pathway. In the case of EPSP synthase, studies on Petunia hybrida cultured cells showed that the enzyme is located predomi- nantly in the chloroplast and is synthesized as a precursor in Abbreviations: BMS, Black Mexican Sweet; DAHP, J-deoxy-~- arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate; EPSP, 5-enol-pyruvyl-shiki- mate-3-phosphate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; S3P, shikimate-3-phosphate. - . .  1107  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The presence of EPSP synthase isozymes has been described in only a few plant species (Pisum satiuum [Mousdale and Coggins, 1985133, Nicotiana syluestris [Ream and Porter, 1984; Rubin et al., 19841, S. bicolor [Ream et al., 1988]), but neither detailed kinetic nor molecular characterization has been reported, nor has the subcellular localization been investigated. A minor portion of EPSP synthase activity in P. satiuum has indeed been associated with the cytosol, being absent in density- gradient-purified chloroplasts (Mousdale and Coggins, 1985 b). Here we describe the detection and purification to electro- phoretic homogeneity of two EPSP synthase isoforms from maize cultured cells. A comparison of their physical and functional properties failed to point out any remarkable dif- ferences between the two presumptive isozymes. Subcellular fractionation studies also suggested that both of these pro- teins are functionally located in the plastid. However, whereas one form was constitutively expressed throughout the culture cycle of growth, the other was detectable only in actively proliferating cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals The ammonium salt of S3P was prepared according to Coggins et al. (1987); the purity of the preparations and the concentration of the compound were determined by the HPLC method described by Mousdale and Coggins (1985a). Biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Sepha- cel, Mono-Q 5.5, and mo1 wt markers were supplied by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Bio-Gel P6DG was from Bio-Rad. Cellulose phosphate (P11) was obtained from Whatman Biochemicals (Maidstone, UK). Analytical grade glyphosate (acid form) was from Riedel-de Haen (Seelze, Germany). Cell Culture Zea mays L. var Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) cells, originally obtained from the laboratory of Dr. V. Walbot (Stanford, CA), were cultured in liquid suspension on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) in the dark at 26 f 1OC. Every 2 weeks cells were subcultured by transfemng 10-mL aliquots into 100 mL of fresh medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts (Mura- shige and Skoog, 1962) with 0.3% (w/v) Suc and l mg L-' 2,4-D. Enzyme Assay EPSP synthase activity was measured at 35OC in the for- ward direction. The activity of the purified enzyme was measured by determining the inorganic phosphate release using the malachite green dye assay method (Lanzetta et al., 1979) with minor modifications. The reaction mixture con- tained, in a final volume of 0.1 mL, 100 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM S3P, 1 m~ PEP, and a limiting amount of enzyme (10-25 pkat). After an appropriate incubation period (up to 20 min), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mL of colorimetric solution [9.2 mM malachite green and 8.5 mM (NH4)6M07024.4H20 in 1 M HC1, with 2 g L-' 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]- 1-propane sdfonate added to stabilize color development] followed, a fter exactly 1 min, by 0.1 mL of 34% (w/v) Na citrate soluticm. After 15 min at iroom temperature, samples were read at 660 nm against Lmincubated blanks. Under these conditions, the mo- lar absorption coefficient was found to be 75,000 M-' cm-'. This nnethod was also routinely used during i9urification by adding to the assay mixture 0.5 mM (NH4)6M~7024-4H20 to inhibit phosphatases. EPSP synthase activity was deter- mined reading sample A660 against blanks in whilih s3P had been omitted or, altematively, in which 10 m~ glyphosate had been added. Phosphatase activity was measured with p -  nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate as described (Malamy and Horecker, 1964). Enzyme Purification Step 1. F'reparation of Crude Extract Cells grown to mid-linear phase were harvesteli, weighed, powdercd in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in 2 mL g-' buffer A, [50 mM Hepes-NaOH, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 m~ with 17% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (w/v) added to prevent oxidation of phenolic compounds. A11 subsequen.,: operations were camied out at O to 4OC. The homogenate was clarified by centxifugation at 5,OOOg for 30 min, and the resulting supematant was further centrifuged at 20,OOOg for 30 min.

Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation The cmde extract was fractionated with ammordum sulfate and the 55 to 70% saturated fraction was collected by cen- trifugation at 12,OOOg for 20 min; pellets were rN-.suspended in half-strength buffer A and dialyzed three times for 2 h each time against 10 volumes of the same buffer Step 3.  hion-Exchange Chromatography The aimmonium sulfate fraction was loaded ai a constant flow of 160 mL h-' onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 X 10 cm) equilibrated with half-strength buffer A. Aftm extensive washing with the same buffer, enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient from O to 250 m~ NaCl (500 mL), collecting 5-mL fractions. Active fractions were pooled and proteins were concentrated in a centrifugal Ultrafree filter unit (Millipore) by centrifugation for 10 to 30 min at 2500g. The concentrate was buffer-exchanged by passage through a Bio-Gel P6DG column equilibrated with 50 mM Mes-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 2.!j mM GSH, 0.1 m~ IEDTA, and 0.1 mM (NH4)6M07024. 4H20 (buffer B). Step 4 .  Cation-Exchange Chromatography The sample was applied at a flow rate of 40 inL h-' to a cellulose phosphate column (1.6 X 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 50 mL of buffer B supplemented with 0.5 mM PEP and then eluted with a linear gradient from O to 500 mM NaCl in buffer B (250 mL), collecting 5-mL fractions. Active fractions were concentrated and desalted as above.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Substrate Elution Chromatography After the pH was adjusted to 6.0, the sample was applied a t a  constant flow rate of 10 mL h-' to a cellulose phosphate column (1.6 X 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer C (as buffer 8, but pH 6.0) .  The column was washed until no protein was detected in the eluate; EPSP synthase was then eluted with a linear gradient of O to 0.5 mM PEP and S3P.in buffer C (200 mL), collecting 2.5-mL fractions. Active fractions of the two resulting activities were pooled, concentrated, and di- alyzed against buffer D (20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, con- taining 20% [v/v] glycerol and 2.5 mM GSH). Enzyme prep- arations were stored at -2OOC. Under these conditions, EPSP synthase activity was found to be stable for at least 3 months. Protein Determination Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (1976), using BSA as standard. Electrophoresis Discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed at 2OoC by the method of Laemmli (1970) with a 4% stacking and a 10% separating gel. Gels were silver stained for proteins over a previous Coomassie blue R250 stain by using the method described by Heukeshoven and Demick (1985) with slight modifications. Nondenaturing electrophoresis of purified proteins was run at 4OC with separating gels at various acrylamide concentra- tions; gels were silver stained or stained for EPSP synthase activity as described (Nimmo and Nimmo, 1982). lsoform Detection in Crude Extracts Cells harvested at various stages during the growth cycle of the culture were resuspended in 2 mL g-' buffer A and homogenized in a Teflon-in-glass Potter homogenizer with 15 strokes. After centrifugation at 20,OOOg for 20 min, solid ammonium sulfate was added to the crude extract to give 70% saturation. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer E (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 5% [v/v] glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA), and column-desalted against the same buffer. Then, extracts were further centrifuged at 100,OOOg for 60 min and I-mL aliquots of the resulting supematant were injected onto a Mono-Q 5.5 FPLC column equilibrated with buffer E. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-' using a computer- controlled (Kontron 450) linear gradient from O to 80 m~ NaCl(30 mL), and 0.5-mL fractions were collected. Subcellular Fractionation and Markers' Assay Plastids from cells grown to mid-log phase were isolated by rate-zona1 sedimentation on discontinuous Perco11 gra- dients as described (Miemyk, 1985). Plastidial stroma prep- arations were made by diluting washed plastids with buffer E and centrifuging at 100,OOOg for 60 min. The supematant was analyzed for EPSP synthase isoform content as above. The activity of marker enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase, Cyt c oxidase, Mn-dependent DAHP synthase, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase) in crude and in den- sity-gradient-purified plastidial extracts was determined as described previously (Kerster and Deley, 1966; Lück, 1962; Wharton and Tzagoloff, 1967; Muday and Herrmann, 1992; Lilley and Walker, 1974, respectively). RESULTS Purification of Maize EPSP Synthase When cells were harvested in middle exponential growth phase, crude extracts from BMS suspension cultures con- tained EPSP synthase at a specific activity of 0.43 f 0.08 nkat mg-' protein. The results of the purification procedure are outlined in Table I. Ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography succeeded in both a prelimi- nary enrichment of EPSP synthase and the remova1 of un- specific phosphatases (data not shown), which can interfere with the enzyme assay and substrate elution on phosphocel- lulose. However, the addition of 0.1 m~ (NH4)6M07024. 4H20, which selectively inhibits hydrolases without affecting EPSP synthase catalytic rate, to the column buffer allowed us to perform a separation on a cellulose phosphate column even in the presence of residual contamination by phospha- tases. The use of a first phosphocellulose column as a simple cation exchanger, equilibrated at low pH values and washed with buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM PEP before eluting the enzyme, greatly enhanced the subsequent, high-resolu- tion purification step. When the former was omitted, severa1 other proteins co-eluted with EPSP synthase during substrate elution chromatography (not shown). The maximum specific activity observed after the second cellulose phosphate column reflects a purification of over 2000-fold, with an overall yield Table 1.

Purified enzyme preparations were sub-stantially stable: between 75 and 85% of the activity wasretained during 30 d of storage at 0°C or 3 months of storageat -20°C.Chromatographic Evidence for Two Enzyme FormsThe first purification steps gave no evidence supportingthe presence of EPSP synthase isoforms. Only a single activitywas evident after both anion- and cation-exchange chroma-tography. Even during the last step, if the cellulose phosphatecolumn was eluted by directly adding high concentrations ofthe two substrates, only one activity could be detected (datanot shown). In contrast, when substrate elution was carriedout by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 mM S3P and PEP at avery low flow rate, two well-separated EPSP synthase ac-tivities were recovered in the eluate (Fig. 1). This result washighly reproducible, and the same pattern was obtainedwhen purification was performed in the presence of proteaseinhibitors (1 mM PMSF and 1 ^M pepstatin A). The relativeproportion of the two activities varied. The pools obtainedby collecting the most active fractions, designated I and IIaccording to their order of elution, were used for the subse-quent characterization.Homogeneity of Purified EPSP SynthasesThe purified enzymes were electrophoretically homoge-neous: when silver stained, denaturing polyacrylamide gelsshowed only a single band in both cases (Fig. 2, lanes B andC). The mobilities of the two proteins, although very similar,were not identical. Figure 2 also shows the electrophoreticpattern obtained when the same preparations were analyzedin the absence of detergents (lanes D and E).

When the native gel was stained for EPSP synthaseactivity, the same bands were observed (lanes F and G).Structural and Functional Characterization of thePurified ProteinsTo ascertain whether possible differences between the twoisoforms occurred that could account for a distinct functionalrole in cellular metabolism, the purified proteins were thor-oughly characterized with regard to structural, kinetic, andbiochemical properties. Data obtained, summarized in TableII, failed to demonstrate any striking difference between thetwo isoforms.Gel-filtration experiments confirmed the minor differencein molecular mass that was detected by SDS-PAGE. Resultsobtained with respect to temperature and pH optima werevery similar. The activities of both proteins showed only asingle broad maximum of activity between pH 7.0 and 8.0(not shown) and were rapidly inactivated at temperaturesexceeding 60°C. Slight differences were found for affinityconstants and temperature dependence of enzyme activity.As reported for the enzyme from other sources, the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate strongly inhibited the activityof both maize EPSP synthase isoforms. At a concentration of1 mM glyphosate, enzyme activity was completely sup-pressed, and 50% inhibition was achieved with 6 to 8 fiMglyphosate.

As expected, because EPSP synthase is not a regulated branchpoint enzyme, the activities of both purified proteins were unaffected by aromatic amino acids, chorismic acid, or anthranilic acid (data not shown). However, a pronounced difference between the two iso- forms was found in heat-inactivation experiments. Incuba- tion of the purified proteins for increasing times at 45OC resulted in a faster disruption of EPSP synthase activity I. As shown in Figure 3, the time required to reduce its catalytic rate by 50% was about 20 min, whereas 50% of the initial activity of the enzyme I1 was still retained after a 60-min treatment.

Data, expressed as percentage of untreated controls, are averages k SD of four independent determinations. Detection of EPSP Synthase lsoforms in Crude Extracts Since the Iack of any apparent difference in their functional properties could suggest that the appearance of two activities might be ascribed to an experimental artifact arising during the purification procedure (e.g. by means of a partia1 prote- olysis of a single protein), crude extracts were analyzed for EPSP synthase activity following anion-exchange FPLC. The use of a very narrow NaCl gradient allowed us also to detect the presence of two enzyme forms in the desalted O to 70% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fig. 4). Rechromatography of the two isoforms resulted in each case in a single activity at the same ionic strength. The purified proteins were then buffer-exchanged and eluted under the same experimental conditions. In both cases the analysis of the eluate showed a single activity corresponding to one of the two activities present in crude extracts, eluting in the reverse order than from the cellulose phosphate column. Moreover, the first, less-abundant isoform detectable in crude extracts showed a more pronounced thermal stability, a result consistent with those previously obtained with the purified proteins. Subcellular Localization and Expression Pattern of the Two lsoforms The availability of a method to detect EPSP synthase isoforms in crude preparations made subcellular localization experiments feasible. Plastids were purified from BMS cells by rate-zona1 sedimentation on discontinuous Perco11 gra- dients. Plastidial stroma preparations were analyzed for EPSP synthase isoforms and marker enzyme content, and data were compared to the corresponding specific activities meas- ured in crude extracts. Results (Table 111) clearly demonstrated a plastidial localization of both EPSP synthase isoforms.

The results, outlined in Table IV, indicated that although one isoform persisted throughout the cycle at substantial levels, the other, significantly less abundant, increased with the onset of ex- ponential growth and declined in stationary phase. DISCUSSION In this paper we describe the purification of maize EPSP synthase from BMS cultured cells. The cell line employed was initially selected as the source of the enzyme because it produced EPSP synthase with higher specific activity than a few other tested lines of the same cultivar (Forlani et al., 1992). To obtain electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme, three chromatographic steps were required. The final purifi- cation step involved substrate elution from cellulose phos- phate. I’he enzyme bound to the phosphocellul ose column only at low pH values. Above pH 6.2, the resin d d not retain EPSP synthase activity, the elution of which was simply slowed down. The enzyme could be selectively eluted with a mixture of the two substrates (S3P and PEP) only if the column had been previously equilibrated at a pH between 5.7 and 6.1. Below pH 5.6, the enzyme bounli tightly to cellulose phosphate and could be eluted only b!i high ionic strength. This behavior is consistent with that observed upon IEF of the purified EPSP synthase: substrate elution can be achieved only at a pH near its isoelectric point, a t which the enzyme is retained only by its affinity to the phosphate groups and not by other ionic interactions. Enzyme activity could also be eluted from the cellulose phosphate column with either PEP or S3P alone, but elution resultetl in a broad peak. The last step in the purification procedure allowed us to separate two EPSP synthase isoforms. Two activities were Table IV.

The relative ratio of these enzyme forms varied somewhat from experiment to experiment. The presence of EPSP synthase isoforms is consistent with previous reports. A minor proportion of extraplastidial EPSP synthase activity was described in Pisum sativum (Mousdale and Coggins, 1985b). A second peak of activity was also reported in extracts from Nicotiana sylvestris cultured cells (Ream and Porter, 1984; Rubin et al., 1984). Three isoforms were separated by anion-exchange HPLC from dark-grown seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (Ream et al., 1988). A partia1 characterization of these putative isozymes has been described only in the latter study (Ream et al., 1988): in this case the authors failed to find any significant difference between the two major forms. Also, in the case of maize a high degree of similarity exists between the enzyme forms. We compared the physical and kinetic properties of the two purified proteins, but character- ization experiments did not succeed in finding any difference that could account for a distinct role in cellular metabolism. However, some factors do suggest the occurrence of true isozymes versus the possibility of an experimental artifact. The addition of protease inhibitors did not change the relative ratio of the two isoforms. The same EPSP synthase isoforms could also be detected and separated in crude extracts. In this case their ratio varied significantly (2:l in crude extracts, about 1:l in purified preparations), but according to their differential stability, so that the final yield of the less abun- dant isoform was expected to be higher than that of the more abundant isoform. The two isoforms showed a different pattern of expression during the culture growth cycle. One was expressed throughout the process, the other was detected preferentially during the exponential phase of growth. Such a result seems to rule out the possibility that the BMS cells might not be homozygous for EPSP synthase. Moreover, two EPSP synthase activities have been detected in extracts from another BMS cell line, which showed a natural tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate (Forlani et al., 1992). Enzyme I closely resembled one of those isoforms in that it is glyphosate sensitive and expressed throughout the culture growth cycle. Distinct isozyme pairs, one plastidial and the other cyto- solic, have so far been identified for key branchpoint enzymes of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis such as DAHP synthase (Ganson et al., 1986) and chorismate mutase and anthranilate synthase (Poulsen and Veerporte, 1991). Only the isoforms located in the chloroplast were shown to be subjected to strong allosteric control (Goers and Jensen, 1984). Because cytosolic location of enzymes catalyzing other steps in the prechorismate pathway has been reported (Rothe et al., 1983; Mousdale et al., 1987), dual biosynthetic pathways of aro- matic biosynthesis in spatially separated compartments have been hypothesized to exist as a universal characteristic of higher plants (Jensen, 1986). However, data obtained with density-gradient-purified plastidial preparations clearly demonstrated a plastidial 10- calization of both maize EPSP synthase isoforms. Moreover, severa1 reports have been published in recent years describmg gene pairs encoding DAHP synthase (Dyer et al., 1990; Zhao and Herrmann, 1992) and also the anthranilate synthase a subunit (Niyogi and Fink, 1992) and the Trp synthase p subunit (Berlyn et al., 1989; Last et al., 1991), both of which show putative chloroplast transit peptides at their amino termini. The molecular data now available point to an exclu- sively plastidial localization of the shikimate pathway. Cy- tosolic isozymes have been interpreted as the result of aber- rant processing of a plastidial protein in cultured cells (Singh et al., 1991). The occurrence of more distantly related genes that encode cytosolic isozymes could not be ruled out. In the case of EPSP synthase, at least four genes have been detected in rape (Gasser and Klee, 1990) and six have been detected in tobacco (Goldsbrough et al., 1990). On the other hand, cytosolic isoforms devoted to the production of aromatic amino acids for the synthesis of secondary metabolites might not be expressed in cultured cells. At least for some control points in the aromatic amino acid pathway, regulation in plants seems to involve differential expression of duplicated genes, both of which express plastid enzymes. Our results on maize EPSP synthase suggest the possibility that two distinct whole prechorismate pathways could exist in the plastid, even if they are differentially expressed (in distinct cell types or at different times). Bio- chemical evidence suggests that one EPSP synthase isoform is constitutively expressed, whereas the other seems to be regulated, possibly by increased demand of aromatic amino acids, since it can be detected only in actively proliferating cells. This would be consistent with data previously described for both DAHP synthase and anthranilate synthase. Steady- state mRNA levels and enzyme specific activities of anthra- nilate synthase-1 and Mn-dependent DAHP synthase in- creased dramatically following both wounding and bacterial pathogen infiltration, whereas the other isoforms were un- affected (Dyer et al., 1989; McCue and Conn, 1989; Niyogi and Fink, 1990; Muday and Herrmann, 1992). This has been interpreted as being due to the synthesis ex novo of aromatic metabolites as indole-glucosinolates and phytoalexins re- quired in the plant defense response. But an augmented need for aromatic amino acids for protein synthesis in rapidly proliferating maize cells might also determine the transcrip- tion of an inducible EPSP synthase isoform. Work is now under way to elucidate this point. Received November 22, 1993; accepted April3, 1994. Copyright Clearance Center: 0032-0889/94/105/llO7/08.
