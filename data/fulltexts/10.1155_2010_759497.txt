Abstract: Thevetia peruviana seeds contain glucosides of neriifolin, 
acetylneriifolin and thevetin. Seed oil distillates of Thevetia peruviana 
have been found to contain anti-bacterial activity. In the persent work, the 
fresh flowers of Thevetia peruviana was subjected to phytochemical 
studies.  The results of the study showed that the flowers contain 
quercetin, kaempferol and quercetin-7-o-galactoside. The structure of the 
isolated compound was characterized by UV, 1H NMR and 13C NMR 
spectra. The anti-inflammatory character of the isolated compound was 
tested by in vitro method and the results of the study revealed that the 
isolated compound showed a biphasic property.  
Keywords:  Thevetia Peruviana, Quercetin, Kaempferol, Anti-inflammatory. 
Introduction 
Phytochemistry is the branch of chemistry which deals with the isolation and 
characterization of the freely available organic and inorganic compounds in plants using the 
modern techniques like UV, NMR, IR and Mass spectral analysis. Amongst the organic 
compounds, flavonoids play an important role as pigments in plant kingdom. 
 The role of flavonoids in clinical conditions such as hypertension, rheumatism, 
arthritis and pregnancy and also their beneficial effects in frost-bite and cold injury have 
been well documented.  Seeds of Thevetia peruviana were screened for their antifungal 
photoactivity1.   
 The extracts and preparation from the plant which are hopefully safe, exhibited various 
additional  biological  effects  such  as   antioxidant,  immunomodulatory,  anticancerogenic,  
1585 H. P. KAVITHA et al. 
antimicrobial, antiparasitic and insect antifeedant or repellent activities2. Each year there are 
thousands of yellow oleander poisoning cases in South Asia and probably hundreds  of  deaths, 
though it possess several pharmacological activities3. Several flavonoids are moderately 
effective against laboratory cultures of malignant cells. Anti-ulcer and anti-tumor activities 
of flavonoids have also been observed. In the present work, the flowers of Thevetia 
peruviana have been subjected to phytochemical studies with a view to isolate and 
characterize their polyphenolics and also to study their biological activity. 
 Thevetia peruviana an evergreen shrub, belonging to apocynanceae family, is a very 
poisonous shrub in nature and the kernels being the most toxic. The active principles in 
yellow oleander are cardiac glycosides4. The physical properties of the fruit and kernel are 
unique and different from other tree born oilseeds i.e. the storage, transport handling etc.  
Activities related to the fruits and kernels will require modifications in the processes and 
structures prevailing for other tree born oilseeds5-7. Though the kernel fraction in fruit of 
Thevetia peruviana is only 16.14%, the amazingly high oil content for use in different 
industrial purpose is an incentive for its post-harvest processing.  
 Thevetin is pharmacologically the most active constituent, especially on heart.  
Thevetoxin closely resembles Thevetin in pharmacological action but is less toxic. The 
seeds contain glycosides of neriifolin, acetyl neriifolin and Thevetin. Seed oil distillates of 
Thevetia peruviana has been found to contain anti-bacterial activity. The leaves of Thevetia 
peruviana are used to toothache due to caries. It is used in antirheumatic and decongestant.   
Its branches are used for febrifuge and purge.   
Experimental 
Fresh flowers of Thevetia peruviana collected were extracted with 90% methyl alcohol 
under reflux.  The alcoholic extract was concentrated in vacuo and the aqueous concentrate 
was successively fractionated with benzene, peroxide free ether and ethyl acetate. The 
benzene fraction did not yield any isolable material.    
Ether fraction 
The ether fraction was concentrated in vacuo and left in an ice-chest for a few days. The 
yellow solid that separated when subjected to paper chromatography revealed the presence 
of two aglycones. The mixture of aglycones was separated by partial paper chromatography. 
The two solids separated were labeled as A1 and A2. 
Quercetin (A1) 
The solid A1 was dissolved in acetone and kept in an ice-chest for a few days.  The yellow 
solid that separated was filtered and recrystallized from methyl alcohol. The yellow needles 
obtained, melted at 313-315 oC. The yield of the compound was 0.02%. It was readily 
soluble in organic solvents and sparingly in hot water. It gave a golden yellow when fumed 
with ammonia and appeared yellow in sodium hydroxide. It showed a pale green 
fluorescence with concentrated sulphuric acid. It reduced ammoniacal silver nitrate in the 
cold and Fehling’s solution on heating. It answered the Horhammer-Hansel, Wilson’s boric 
acid and Gibb’s test. It did not answer Molisch’s test.  
 It shows λmax (nm) at 255, 269,370; NaOMe 262, 321, 420;  AlCl3 267,303,458;

Results and Discussion 
The fresh flowers of Thevetia peruviana have been found to contain quercetin, kaempferol 
and quercetin 7-o-galactoside. 
 UV spectrum of quercetin exhibited two major peaks at 370 nm and 255 nm which 
showed the presence of a flavonol skeleton. Flavonols which have free –OH groups at 
both the 3 and 4’ positions are unstable in sodium acetate and the absorption peaks in the 
sodium acetate spectrum degenerate in a few minutes8 which is actually observed in our 
compound. 
 In the 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, TMS) of the aglycone, the hydroxyl 
proton at C-5 absorbs at δ12.494 ppm as a distinct singlet. The sharp singlets at δ10.796 and 
δ9.605 ppm correspond to –OH protons at C-7 and C-3. The doublet at δ9.378 ppm and a 
singlet observed at δ9.321 ppm accounts for the hydroxyl protons at C-3’and C-4’. The C-5’ 
protons appears as a doublet at δ6.934 ppm (J=8.5Hz).  The signals due to the protons at C-
2’ and C-6’ overlap at δ7.677 ppm. A ring protons at C-6 and C-8 could be located 
respectively at δ6.185 (d, J=2.5Hz) and δ6.439ppm (d, J=2.5Hz) 
 The 100 MHz 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) spectrum of the flavonol shows a signal at the 
offset region around δ12.543 ppm, revealing the presence of a free 5-OH proton. The signal 
at δ10.120 ppm indicates the presence of free 7-OH proton. The C-6 proton occurs as a 
doublet at δ6.233 ppm, higher field than that of C-8 proton which also occurs as a doublet at 
δ6.439 ppm.  Protons at C-2’, 3’, 5’ and 6’ (due to free rotation of the B-ring) appear as a 
two pairs of ortho coupled doublets. The H-3’, 5’ doublets occurs at δ6.872 ppm upfield 
from the H-2’,6’ doublet which in turn occurs at δ8.032 ppm due to the shielding effect of 
the oxygen substituent.

 Anti-inflammatory drugs may be defined as components that inhibit the whole or any 
portion of an acute or chronic inflammation reaction irrespective of whether the drug is 
clinically useful or not. Clinically anti-inflammatory drugs are judged by their action on the 
pain, stiffness or swelling of the affected part
.
 
 Red blood cells (RBC) have been used to study the action of prymnesin, as algae toxin 
membrane. Red blood cells has been used as a model system by a number of workers for the 
study of interaction of drugs with membranes. Drugs like anesthetics stabilize red blood 
cells against hypotonic haemolysis at low concentration but cause haemolysis at high 
concentration. 
 The stabilization of red blood cells against hypotonic haemolysis has attracted the 
attention of a number of workers. Haemolytic effect of membrane active substances has 
been the interest of few others. The action of phospholipases membrane degrading enzymes 
using red blood cells has also been investigated. In these entire cases hemoglobin leak was 
observed. 
Procedure 
Collection of blood 
Blood was collected from healthy human volunteers using sterile 22 gauze hypodermic 
needle. The collected blood was mixed with equal volume of sterile alsever solution 
(containing 2% dextrose, 0.8% sodium citrate, 0.05% citric acid and 0.42% sodium chloride) 
and stored at 4 oC. 
Saline 
Saline at different concentrations were prepared. (Isosaline 0.85% and hyposaline 0.25%). 
Preparation of human red blood cell suspension 
The blood was centrifuged and the packed cells obtained were washed thrice with isosaline 
(0.85%, pH 7.2) and a 2% suspension was made with isosaline. 
Determination of human red blood cell membrane stabilization 
Solutions of different concentrations of flavonoids were prepared. Assay mixture contained 
the drug flavonoid in concentrations as mentioned in (Table 4), 1 mL of phosphate buffer 
(0.15 M, pH 7.4), 2 mL of hypo saline (0.25%) and 0.5 mL of 2% human red blood cell 
suspension. All the tubes were incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. Then they were centrifuged 
and hemoglobin content in the supernatant was estimated using a photoelectric colorimeter 
at 560 nm. Percentage haemolysis was calculated assuming haemolysis produced by the 
cells in the presence of distilled water to be 100%. A control has been done without the 
drug. The values are tabulated in Table 4.

Isolation, Characterization and Anti-Inflammatory Property 1590 
 The human red blood cell membrane stabilization studies may be considered as a 
screening investigation for anti-inflammatory properties. In our present work, the yellow 
pigments isolated from Thevetia peruviana showed a biphasic property. 
 The glycoside isolated from Thevetia peruviana showed an initial stabilization to reach 
a maximum at 50 µg and the value decreases and remains constant with increasing 
concentration. Such kind of biphasic property is prevalent in polyphenols. 
Conclusion 
In the present work, the fresh flowers of Thevetia peruviana was subjected to phytochemical 
studies.  The results of the study showed that the flowers contain quercetin, kaempferol and 
quercetin-7-o-galactoside. The structure of the isolated compound was characterized by UV, 
1H NMR and 13C NMR. The anti- inflammatory character of the isolated compound was 
tested by in-vitro method and the results of the study revealed that the isolated compound 
showed a biphasic property.
