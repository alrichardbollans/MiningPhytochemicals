Background: Elevated systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause hypotension during septic shock and 
induce capillary leakage in acute lung injury. Manassantin B has anti-inflammatory and anti-plasmoidal properties. 
This study examined the effects of manassantin B on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in 
murine macrophages. 
Methods: RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were incubated without or with (1, 3 and 10 μM) manassantin B and without 
or with (100 ng/ml) LPS. Manassantin B dissolved in phosphate buffered saline was added to the medium 1 h prior 
to the addition of LPS. The degree of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) including extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun amino terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAPK, and the level of 
interleukin (IL)-1β were determined 30 min and 24 h after the addition of LPS respectively.
Results: Manassantin B inhibited the production of IL-1β and attenuated the phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and p38 
MAPK, but not that of JNK, in RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS. 
Conclusions: Manassantin B reduces LPS-induced IL-1β expression through effects on ERK1/2- and p38 MAPK-
mediated pathways. Manassantin B has potential as a potent anti-inflammatory drug for use in pathological 
processes such as sepsis or acute lung injury. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2012; 62: 161-165)

Vol. 62, No. 2, February 2012 Effects of manassantin B on inflammation
Introduction
Despite newly developed resuscitation therapies and the 
use of modern antibiotics, sepsis is still a leading cause of death 
in critically ill patients [1]. The mortality rate in sepsis patients 
remains as high as 40-70% [2]. Severe sepsis is characterized by 
hypoperfusion of major organs, leading to multiple organ failure, 
shock, and death. Inflammation, a physiological response to 
infection or injury, plays a key role in both health and disease. 
Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-8 promote 
systemic inflammation. Cytokine-mediated host defense 
mechanisms induce significant cell and organ injury and play 
crucial roles in the pathophysiology of sepsis [3]. 
IL-1β is produced from the cleavage of the inactive pro-IL-
1β by stimulated leukocytes and is a fundamental contributor 
to local and systemic inflammatory responses [4]. IL-1β is a pro-
inflammatory cytokine that functions as a critical regulator of 
the host defense in response to an infection or injury. However, 
IL-1β is extremely toxic when present in excess [5]. Elevated 
systemic levels of IL-1β may cause hypotension during septic 
shock and induce capillary leakage in acute lung injury [6]. IL-
1β is also involved in chronic inflammation associated with 
arthritis, lung fibrosis and atherosclerosis [7-9]. Therefore, 
strategies to modulate IL-1β production in inflammatory 
diseases are of therapeutic interest. In addition, IL-1β activates 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family including 
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK [10].
Nontoxic molecules that modulate macrophage-mediated 
inflammatory responses may provide a novel therapeutic stra-
tegy for the treatment of sepsis. Numerous studies have been 
performed to identify the new molecules. The manassantin 
group of structurally related and functionally unique dineolig-
nans were recently isolated from active root extracts of Saururus 
cernuus L (Saururaceae), also referred to as “lizard tail” [11]. 
This fragrant aquatic plant is found in the North America as 
well as in many parts of Asia (Saururus	chinensis) [12-14]. 
Although their structures and relative stereochemistries were 
only determined recently, the medicinal value of the plant has 
long been recognized by Native Americans, early colonists 
and practitioners of Korean traditional medicine for a range of 
diseases [14,15]. Manassantin A and B have biological activities, 
such as anti-inflammatory and anti-plasmodial effects [12,16].
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 
manassantin B on LPS-induced activation of the pro-inflam-
matory cytokine IL-1β and intracellular signaling pathway 
such as the MAPKs signaling system, and the possibility that 
manassantin B might be a promising agent for reducing inflam-
matory response.
Materials and Methods
Materials 
Manassantin B was donated from the College of Pharmacy, 
Yeungnam University, Korea. Escherichia	coli 055:B5 endotoxin 
(lipopolysaccharide, LPS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies specific for phosphorylated 
(P)-ERK, P-JNK and p38 MAPK as well as total (T)-ERK, T-JNK 
and T-p38 MAPK were supplied by Cell Signaling Technologies 
(Beverly, MA, USA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) kits for IL-1β were purchased from R&D Systems 
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM) high glucose/L-glutamine, fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from GIBCO 
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein 
assay reagent was supplied by Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). 
Cell culture and treatment
The RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line was purchased 
from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). The cells were 
grown in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FBS, 
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) in a 
5% CO2 incubator at 37
oC. The cells were plated at a density of 
2 × 10
6 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 5 × 10
5 cells/well in 24-well 
plates. For all experiments, the cells were incubated until they 
reached 80-90% confluence. The adherent macrophages were 
washed gently with Ca
2+ and Mg
2+-free Dulbecco’s phosphate 
buffered saline (DPBS) and cultured in serum-free DMEM for 
2 h. Then, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence 
(1, 3 and 10 μM) manassantin B without or with LPS (100 ng/
ml). Manassantin B dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) was added to the medium 1 h prior to the addition of 
LPS. The following groups were then isolated in separate wells: 
control (manassantin B, 0 μM), manassantin B (1, 3 and 10 μM), 
LPS (100 ng/ml) and LPS+ manassantin B (1, 3 and 10 μM). 
The degree of activation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK were 
determined at 30 min and the level of IL-1β at 24 h after the 
addition of LPS, respectively.
Cell viability assay
To evaluate the effect of manassantin B on the viability of 
RAW 264.7 macrophages, the cells were treated with various 
extract concentrations for 24 h, and then cell viability was evalu-
ated using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide 
(MTT) assay. Twenty-four h prior to culture termination, 10 
μl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4) was added 
to each well, and the cells were continuously cultured for 4 163 www.ekja.org

h. Then 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added for 
solubilization. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an 
ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, 
USA). Each assay was repeated at least three times.
ELISA
Immunoreactive IL-1β were quantified using commercially 
available ELISA kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 
USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions as described 
previously [17]. 
Western blot analysis
Western blots to detect levels of phosphorylated and total 
ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK were performed essentially as 
previously described [18]. 
Statistical analysis 
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. A Kruskal-Wallis H test 
was used for group comparisons. A P value < 0.05 was con-
sidered significant.
Results
Effect of manassantin B on RAW 264.7 cell viability
The detrimental effects of any compound or plant extract on 
the cell metabolism need to be determined before the biological 
activity can be examined. Cell viability was not significantly 
changed by the presence of manassantin B up to 10 μM (Fig. 1). 
Effects of manassantin B on the expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in LPS stimulated RAW 
264.7 cells
Manassantin B alone did not affect the production of IL-1β 
in RAW 264.7 cells over the range of concentrations examined. 
However, it attenuated an increase in IL-1β levels induced by 
LPS in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1).
Effects of manassantin B on LPS-induced MAPKs 
activation
The effects of manassantin B on the phosphorylation of 
ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK were examined to determine 
its effect on MAPKs in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In a 
preliminary study, the maximum MAPKs phosphorylation 
occurred 30 min after the LPS (100 ng/ml) treatment in 
RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the cells were 
incubated with manassantin B (1, 3, 10 uM) for 1 h and then 
with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Manassantin B attenuated the 
phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in LPS-stimulated

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effects of manassantin B, an 
active root extract of Saururus cernuus L, on proinflammatory 
cytokine production and activation of MAPKs in murine 
macrophage RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. Manassantin 
B attenuated the LPS-induced increase of inflammatory 
cytokine IL-1β and phosphorylations of signaling molecules ERK 
1/2 and p38 MAPK. These findings suggest that manassantin B 
has an anti-inflammatory property.
RAW 264.7 murine macrophages are a popular macrophage 
cell model to examine a variety of inflammatory processes 
[19-21]. Macrophages are key regulators of inflammation and 
immunity [22]. Besides being involved in microbial clearance, 
they play an important role in regulating T cell function, 
proliferation, regulation of antibody production and production 
of mediators for cellular immunity. Many of these activities 
are mediated through pro-inflammatory cytokines [23]. When 
LPS is presented to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) in the cell 
membrane, an interaction via CD 14 and LPS binding protein 
leads to the activation of MAPKs, which are important for the 
LPS induced production of a range of inflammatory cytokines, 
including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory 
protein (MIP)-2 [24]. These cytokines are essential for the 
eradication of pathogens. However, excessive release of 
inflammatory cytokines provokes life-threatening conditions, 
including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and 
multiple organ failure [25]. 
The MAPK signaling pathways consist of a series of kinases 
that are activated sequentially and consequently phosphorylate 
the downstream kinases and transduce extracellular stimuli 
into intracellular responses. The MAPK family includes ERK, 
JNK and p38 MAPK. One of the major functions of MAPK is 
the activation of transcription factors, several of which bind 
to the promoters of pro-inflammatory cytokines [26]. ERK1/2 
regulates TNF-α and MIP-2 expression and ERK1/2 inhibitor 
(PD98059) reduces the expression of these cytokines [27,28]. 
Down-regulation of TLR 4 expression, using RNA interference 
techniques, decreases MAPKs activation, TNF-α and MIP-
2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS [29]. 
In the present study, manassantin B treatment decreased 
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK induced by 
LPS stimulation, but had no affect on JNK phosphorylation, 
suggesting that its anti-inflammatory activity is related to 
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK cascades, but not JNK.
There are some limitations to this study. First, the study 
is limited in its in vitro character of the data, therefore much 
remains to be done in vivo studies in terms of safety and optimal 
dosage. Second, we measured only IL-1β as a pro-inflammatory 
cytokine. Potential interactions with other cytokines related 
with inflammation must be considered. Third, we measured 
the effects of manassantin B on the phosphorylation of MAPK 
without inhibitors due to the generalized results of inhibitor 
study. 
In summary, manassantin B inhibits the production of the 
proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and the phosphorylations of 
ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine 
macrophages. These findings suggest that manassantin B 
reduces LPS-induced IL-1β expression through effects on the 
ERK1/2- and p38 MAPK-mediated pathways in vitro. Thusm 
manassantin B might be a valuable therapeutic agent in 
reducing inflammatory response due to systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome involving sepsis in the clinical setting.
