The plants occur in nutrient-poor environments and havedeveloped insectivorous capability in order to supplement their nutrient uptake. Sarraceniaflava contains the alkaloid coniine, otherwise only found in Conium maculatum, in which itsbiosynthesis has been studied, and several Aloe species. Its ecological role and biosyn-thetic origin in S. flava is speculative. The aim of the current research was to investigate theoccurrence of coniine in Sarracenia and Darlingtonia and to identify common constituents ofboth genera, unique compounds for individual variants and floral scent chemicals. In thiscomprehensive metabolic profiling study, we looked for compound patterns that are associ-ated with the taxonomy of Sarracenia species. In total, 57 different Sarracenia and D. califor-nica accessions were used for metabolite content screening by gas chromatography-massspectrometry. The resulting high-dimensional data were studied using a data mining ap-proach. The two genera are characterized by a large number of metabolites and huge chem-ical diversity between different species. By applying feature selection for clustering and byintegrating new biochemical data with existing phylogenetic data, we were able to demon-strate that the chemical composition of the species can be explained by their known classi-fication. Although transcriptome analysis did not reveal a candidate gene for coniinebiosynthesis, the use of a sensitive selected ion monitoring method enabled the detection ofconiine in eight Sarracenia species, showing that it is more widespread in this genus thanpreviously believed.IntroductionSarraceniaceae is a New World carnivorous plant family comprising three genera: DarlingtoniaTorr. (monotypic), Heliamphora Benth. (ca. 23 species [1]) and Sarracenia L. (ca. 11 species[2]). The distribution of Darlingtonia is limited to a few locations along the western coast ofNorth America, Heliamphora occurs mainly on tepuis of the Guiana Highlands in SouthAmerica and Sarracenia is the most widespread genus in the family, found in the easterncoastal plains of North America. Darlingtonia californica, Sarracenia, and Heliamphora arePLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 1 / 21a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPENACCESSCitation: Hotti H, Gopalacharyulu P, Seppa¨nen-Laakso T, Rischer H (2017) Metabolite profiling ofthe carnivorous pitcher plants Darlingtonia andSarracenia.

Malm Foundation (all to HH), VTT and theAcademy of Finland (decision number 138808 toHR, and 265966 to PG). VTT provided support inthe form of salaries for authors [HH, TS-L, HR], butdid not have any additional role in the study design,able to compete in nutrient-poor habitats due to their insectivorous nature, i.e. the ability toattract, capture, and digest insects to supplement their nutrient uptake. A common feature forall three genera is that they lure insects to their elongated tubular leaves. In order to attractinsects, they produce extrafloral nectar [3], emit insect attractants [4], and most species arebrightly colored. They utilize various methods to capture their prey. Darlingtonia californicaand S. psittacina, for example, hide their entry/exit hole from the inside, displaying multipletranslucent false exits so that insects finally get exhausted and fall into the pitcher. Other Sarra-cenia and Heliamphora species utilize downward pointing hairs and waxy surfaces in theirpitchers in order to trap insects.The family is relatively poorly described in terms of chemical constituents [5], which is sur-prising given the fact that Sarracenia species have long been used as traditional medicine bymany aboriginal communities in North America, and have attracted renewed pharmaceuticalinterest due to recent investigations revealing their cytoprotective activities in cell models [6].Darlingtonia californica has not been chemically investigated at all to date, but several insect-attracting constituents have been described from the spoon-shaped lid structures of pitchersof two Heliamphora species [4]. Various compounds found in Sarracenia have also beenreported, including volatiles [7,8], flavonoids [9–11], phytochemicals [12–14] and pitcher fluidcomposition [3,11,15,16]. Sarracenin, an enol diacetal monoterpene, was first identified in S.flava [17] and later found in a number of Sarracenia [18] and Heliamphora [4] species. Sarrace-nia flava is the most studied species with respect to its chemical composition [7,8,19,20]. Inter-estingly, S. flava contains coniine [21], a toxic alkaloid, which is otherwise only known fromthe unrelated Conium maculatum (Apiaceae) and several Aloe species (Xanthorrhoeaceae)[22,23]. In C. maculatum, a polyketide synthase (PKS) initiates the biosynthesis of coniine[24]. The original study [21] referred to earlier research on S. purpurea, indicating that it couldalso contain coniine or related alkaloids. Mody et al. [21] speculated that coniine in S. flavaparalyzes insects, whereas Harborne [25] postulated insect attraction. Systematic investigationsof the compound’s wider occurrence in the genus have hitherto not been performed. In orderto follow up on the earlier findings in S. flava and to expand our knowledge on coniine distri-bution in Sarracenia, we aimed at investigating a number of accessions using a sensitive gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method applying selected ion monitoring(SIM) to detect coniine reliably in plant material even at low concentrations. Additionally, thetranscriptomes of S. psittacina and S. purpurea were analysed for encoded candidate PKSsputatively involved in coniine biosynthesis.Three previous studies derived the phylogeny of Sarraceniaceae using gene sequence data,with incongruent results [26–28]. Stephens et al. [2] recently addressed this inconsistency byapplying a target enrichment approach to assess the phylogenetic relationships among 75 Sar-racenia accessions. Unlike the mutations from highly conserved genomic loci, the chemicalcomposition usually differs even between closely related species and hence is not suitable forderiving reliable taxonomies [29]. In a biochemical profiling study of volatiles, Ju¨rgens et al.[8] applied an approach based on multidimensional scaling to study the similarities among dif-ferent species. They then used similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) to obtain compoundsthat explained the highest amount of dissimilarity among the samples. Thus, Ju¨rgens et al. [8]focused on the variability in the data without focusing directly on the phylogenetic structure.The phylogeny, on the other hand, may explain the chemical diversity of the species. The aimof our current study was to provide a comprehensive catalogue of chemical constituents of Sar-raceniaceae and to examine the extent to which the known phylogenetic information explainsthe chemical composition of the plants. Therefore, we employed a comprehensive metabolicprofiling approach using GC-MS to detect all ions in SCAN mode in a large sample collection.The genus Sarracenia comprises 44 recognised intraspecific taxa [30] within 11 SarraceniaPhytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 2 / 21data collection and analysis, decision to publish, orpreparation of the manuscript.

Our collection was selected to cover adequately the diversity of pitcher plantsthat had been examined in phylogenetic studies [26]. We found common chemical constitu-ents among the plants, unique compounds for individual variants and possible floral scentchemicals as classified according to Knudsen et al. [29], and studied whether the biochemicalprofiles can be explained by the taxonomy presented in Stephens et al. [2].Materials and methodsPlant materialPitchers of cultivated plants were investigated in order to exclude environmental effects. Sarra-cenia L. (56 accessions) and Darlingtonia californica Torr. were provided by C. Klein, Germany(http://www.carnivorsandmore.de). Metabolite and coniine content screening was performedusing global metabolomics in a set of 48 accessions (Table 1) that contained one D. californicaand 47 Sarracenia accessions. The Sarracenia accessions included S. alata Alph.Wood (5 acces-sions), S. flava L. (11 accessions), S. leucophylla Raf. (5 accessions), S. minor Walt. (3 acces-sions), S. oreophila (Kearney) Wherry (2 accessions), S. psittacina Michx. (4 accessions), S.purpurea L. (13 accessions) and S. rubra Walt. (4 accessions).Targeted metabolomics for sensitive detection of coniine was performed in 17 accessions,including eight accessions that were also analyzed using global metabolomics (Table 2). Theseaccessions included S. alata (2 accessions), S. flava (4 accessions), S. leucophylla (1 accession),S. minor (1 accession), S. oreophila (1 accession), S. psittacina (2 accessions), S. purpurea (4accessions) and S. rubra (2 accessions).Cultivated poison hemlock (Conium maculatum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. ‘GoldenPromise’), were used as alkaloid-containing or alkaloid-free reference material, respectively.Metabolite extractionLids and pitchers were separated, washed with tap water and ground up. Fresh (2 g; metaboliteprofiling) or freeze dried (200 mg; coniine analysis) plant material was used for extraction asdescribed in [31]. Lipids were removed from the plant material with 3.0 ml petroleum ether(puriss p.a., Sigma-Aldrich Munich, Germany). The plant material was diluted with 2.0 mlultrapure water and a pH above 9 was obtained by addition of 10% ammonium hydroxidesolution (25% stock solution, pro analysi, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Metaboliteswere extracted twice with 2.0 ml dichloromethane (HPLC grade, Rathburn Chemicals Ltd,Walkerburn, Scotland, UK). The combined dichloromethane extracts were evaporated to dry-ness and dissolved in 100 μl dichloromethane for further analysis.Gas chromatography-mass spectrometrySamples (1 μl) were analysed by GC-MS consisting of a 6890A Series GC (Agilent Technolo-gies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) combined with an Agilent 5973 Network MSD and a Combi-pal automatic sampler (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Analytes were separated by anAgilent HP-5MS capillary column (25 m × 0.2 mm i.d, 0.33 μm). The temperature programstarted at 50˚C with 1 min holding time and then increased at 10˚C/min up to 300˚C. MSDwas operated in electron impact mode at 70 eV.Pure coniine (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was used as the reference compound indeveloping the GC-MS method. To determine the detection limit of coniine in the SIM-method, 1, 5, 10 and 20 μg was spiked into alkaline water and extracted as described in [31].Cotinine (20 μg/sample) (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was used as an internal standard.Phytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 3 / 21Table 1.

The tblastn algorithm in Geneious was used tosearch the sequence database with the Medicago sativa CHS2 amino acid sequence [34] as thetemplate and a stringency setting of 1e-10. The obtained nucleotide sequence hits were trans-lated to amino acid sequences, and the correct reading frames were chosen and aligned usingthe Geneious alignment option.Data handlingPeaks in GC-MS chromatograms were integrated automatically using MSD ChemStation soft-ware (version E.02.01.1177, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Peaks wereidentified with the Palisade Complete 600K Mass Spectral Library (Palisade Mass Spectrome-try, Ithaca, NY, USA) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program (The Standard ReferenceData Program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD,USA). The computer-generated identifications were sorted manually, with a cut-off at 70%identification [35], into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) according totheir chemical structure, elution time and origin. When peaks with same retention time wereidentified as different hydrocarbons in multiple samples, they were treated as n-alkanes at thespecific retention time. The relative peak abundances were used in the data input.Data miningThe metabolite data were treated in two formats: (1) a qualitative format representing presence(i.e. concentration level above the detection limit) or absence (concentration level below thedetection limit) of a compound in a sample, by coding the presence and absence as 1 and 0,respectively, and (2) a quantitative or continuous format in which the concentration level isgiven as the percentage of the total peak area. The main aim of our data mining was to visualizeany patterns present in the data. Towards this goal, it was first noted that the current data arevery high dimensional (i.e. contain a large number of compounds), very sparse (91.35% zerosin the lids dataset and 91.86% in the pitchers dataset), and that the distinct species show hugechemical diversity (i.e. the metabolite composition of different plants is largely distinct).Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that only a small proportion of compounds are likely to beuseful for clustering the samples. A feature selection approach for clustering [36] was appliedin order to identify the most important features required for deriving hierarchical clusters.This approach computes and reweights the overall dissimilarity matrix while applying a lasso-type penalty, which results in a dissimilarity matrix sparse in features [36]. This sparse cluster-ing was applied using the R package sparcl. In order to compute the hierarchical clusteringwith the qualitative format of the data, the hamming distance was used as the dissimilaritymeasure. For the quantitative format of the data, the Euclidean distance was used. The com-plete linkage method was used for the clustering.In order to compare the phylogenetic structure with the chemical profiles, the MP-ESTaccession tree from [2] was downloaded. Then the accessions in the two studies were mappedbased on the location of sample collection, which resulted in a many-to-many mapping(Table 1) with one or more of 42 nodes in the phylogenetic tree matching one or more of 48species in our study. From this, 36 possible bijective maps were enumerated, and compound-based distances corresponding to each bijective map were calculated as follows. The distancebetween every pair of accessions was calculated using hamming distance for the binary andEuclidean distance for the continuous data of the selected metabolite features. These distancesPhytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 7 / 21are referred to below as species-level distances (SLD). Using the clades resolved in the MP-ESTaccession tree (i.e. D. californica, S. flava, S. psittacina, S. minor, S. purpurea complex, S. rubracomplex, S. alata, S. leucophylla, and S. oreophila), distances within and between the cladeswere calculated. A within-clade distance (WCD) was calculated as the average of all pairwiseSLDs of accessions within the clade. A between-clade distance (BCD) was calculated as theaverage of all SLDs of accession-pairs across the pair of clades. Average species-level and clade-level distance matrices were calculated over all 36 bijective maps to derive the average within-clade (aWCD) and between-clade distances (aBCD), as well as the average species-level dis-tances (aSLD). These averaged distances were used to assess how well the metabolite data sup-ports the phylogenetic structure. If the phylogenetic structure explains the compound data, theaWCDs are expected to be lower than the aBCDs. This was assessed by comparing aWCDsagainst not only aBCDs but also aSLDs as an additional test. More precisely, we (I) visualizedaWCDs against the background distance distribution formed by aSLDs (Fig 1B and Fig 2B,S1B and S2B Figs), (II) visualized the difference between the distribution of aWCDs andaBCDs (Fig 1C and Fig 2C, S1C and S2C Figs) and (III) performed one-sided Wilcoxon’s ranksum tests to assess whether aWCDs are less prevalent than aBCDs.In order to visualize the metabolite features selected for clustering alongside the phyloge-netic structure presented in [2], the best mapping of samples between the MP-EST accessiontree and our compound data was obtained. The best bijective map is expected to result in themaximum BCD and minimum WCD among all possible bijective maps. To achieve this objec-tive, we chose the map that yields the maximum difference between the mean values of BCDand WCD i.e. mean(BCD)–mean(WCD) for these visualizations (Fig 1A and Fig 2A, S1A andS2A Figs). Thus, the heat maps shown in Fig 1A and Fig 2A, S1A and S2A Figs contain onlyone sample from our compound dataset for each node in the MP-EST accession tree chosen tomaximize the mean(BCD)–mean(WCD). Since only 42 nodes in the accession tree map to ourdataset, each heat map omits 6 samples from our study. In particular, the samples numbered31 and 46 (Table 1) were omitted in all four heat maps (Fig 1A and Fig 2A, S1A and S2A Figs).Apart from these two samples, 11, 35, 38, and 42 were omitted from Fig 2A; 14, 35, 37, and 44were omitted from S1A Fig; 1, 11, 14, and 38 were omitted from Fig 2A; and 1, 11, 38, and 42were omitted from S2A Fig.All the statistical analyses and visualizations were performed using the R statistical software[37] and its packages such as gplots, sparcl, metadar (http://code.google.com/p/metadar), ihm(http://code.google.com/p/ihm), and RColorBrewer.ResultsConiine identification and occurrence in SarraceniaWith the GC-MS method used, coniine elutes at a constant retention time (6.33±0.01min)even in spiked barley material and C. maculatum leaf extract. The samples were analysed onthe basis of their SCAN mass spectra and were compared to a database. Pure coniine matchedthe database with 86%, or in plant matrix with 78%-86% identity. The retention time of coni-ine was very stable, and the ions 80, 84, and 126 exhibited the same relative abundances in thesample matrix and in the coniine reference substance (Fig 3). Therefore, a match lower than90% can be considered acceptable. Using the SCAN mode, coniine was detected in S. alata, S.flava, S. leucophylla, S. oreophila, S. psittacina and S. purpurea (incl. S. rosea) (Table 1). In D.californica, only the fragment m/z 84 was detected, whereas in S. jonesii (3) none of the ionswere detected at 6.33 min.In order to detect coniine at low concentrations, we operated the GC-MS in SIM mode.Based on the fragmentation pattern of coniine (m/z 43, 56, 70, 80, 84, 97, 110, and 126), thePhytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 8 / 21Fig 1.

The frag-ments m/z 80, 84, and 126 are specific for coniine, in contrast to the ions m/z 56 and 70, whichare shared with many other molecules.The limit of detection for coniine in SIM was 1 μg/ml, which corresponds to 1 μg/g dryweight. Using SIM detection, coniine was identified from S. alata, S. flava, S. leucophylla, S.minor, S. oreophila, S. psittacina, S. purpurea (incl. S. rosea) and S. rubra (incl. S. alabamensis)(Table 2). Of these, S. flava and S. alata samples only contained coniine traces close to thedetection limit, whereas other samples accumulated clearly higher levels of coniine. No coniinewas detected in the pitchers of S. minor var. okefenokeensis or the lids of S. oreophila.PKSs in Sarracenia transcriptomesSarracenia psittacina and S. purpurea transcriptomes were analysed using the tblastn algorithmwith the stringency set to 1e-10 and M. sativa CHS2 as a template, resulting in 8 and 12sequences, respectively. Correct reading frames were selected and aligned with each other afterthe nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences. This resulted in threeunique contigs per species. Of these, one represents the N-terminus and two the C-terminuswhen compared to full-length PKS-enzyme. None of the contigs cover the middle part of thePKS-enzyme sequence, but they do contain all the conserved amino acids in the active site inthe observed area [38] when compared to other full-length PKSs (S3 Fig).Metabolite profilesThe metabolite profiles of lids and pitchers were analysed separately. In addition to analysingthe metabolite profiles using the quantitative (concentration) data, we also investigated thequalitative (presence or absence) data in which compounds with non-zero concentration levels(i.e. with levels above the detection limits) were treated as present and compounds with levelsbelow the detection limits as absent.The manually aligned lid dataset consisted of a total of 560 compounds detected in at leastone sample. Among these, there were library matches (70%) for 69 alcohols, 70 aldehydesand ketones, 53 esters, 58 ethers, 30 carboxylic acids and sterols, 45 hydrocarbons (includingsome identified as alkanes), 148 n-alkanes, 75 nitrogen compounds, and 12 sulphur com-pounds. However, each individual plant’s lid contained an average of only 48 compounds. Thelid sample of S. purpurea subsp. purpurea (16) contained the lowest number of compounds(n = 20) and S. rubra subsp. wherryi (23) had the highest number of compounds (n = 85).The barplot in S4 Fig shows the distribution of compounds across all the lid samples. Further-more, every lid sample had on average approximately six compounds uniquely found in thatsample but in no other sample, one of which could be classified as a floral scent componentwhich had previously been detected from intact flowers [29]. Sarracenia leucophylla (17) dis-played the highest number (n = 4) of floral scent compounds (Table 3). The sample S. purpureasubsp. venosa var. burkii (39) is an exception in that it did not accumulate unique compounds,whereas S. flava var. atropurpurea (35) had the largest number (n = 18) of unique compounds.S1A Table shows the compounds unique to each sample along with their concentration levels.Finally, when we compared the lid samples in pairs, we observed that, on average, every lidsample contained 32 unique compounds (S2A Table).Distribution of aSLDs was calculated using qualitative data of the selected metabolite features and displayed in a density plot.

The barplot in S5 Fig shows the distribution of compounds across all thepitcher samples. Furthermore, every pitcher sample had approximately seven unique com-pounds, one of which, on average, can be considered as a floral scent component [29]. Sarrace-nia flava var. atropurpurea (31) and S. minor var. okefenokeensis (5) had the highest number(n = 6) of floral scent compounds (Table 3). Four samples, S. leucophylla (12), S. psittacina f.heterophylla (6), Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea (16) and S. purpurea subsp. venosa var.montana (41) did not contain unique compounds, whereas S. flava var. atropurpurea (31) hadthe highest number of unique compounds (n = 25). S1B Table shows the compounds uniqueto each sample along with their concentration levels. Similar to the lids, pitcher pairs had anaverage of 32 unique compounds (S2B Table).A sarracenin-like compound was found at an elution time of 18.2 min. Its mass peak wasm/z 225, major fragments m/z 180 and 138, and further fragments were m/z 162, 120, 93, 67and 43.Selection of metabolitesOverall, both the lid and pitcher datasets are very sparse, with 91.35% zeros in the lid datasetand 91.86% in the pitcher dataset. These datasets are also high dimensional, as describedabove, with 560 and 589 compounds, respectively, in the lid and pitcher datasets. We per-formed sparse hierarchical clustering of the data in order to reduce the dimensionality of thedatasets and identify the compounds important for clustering. The metabolite features selectedusing the qualitative and quantitative formats of the data are visualized as heat maps (S6–S9Figs).Integration of phylogenetic clusteringThe MP-EST accession tree presented in [2] was integrated with metabolite profiling data.Firstly, the selected metabolite features were visualized as heat maps with the MP-EST acces-sion tree (Fig 1A and Fig 2A, S1A and S2A Figs). Since the best bijective map between the sam-ples of the two studies was selected for these visualizations, six samples from our compounddataset are omitted from each of the heat maps (Fig 1A and Fig 2A, S1A and S2A Figs). Sec-ondly, the MP-EST accession tree was used to assess whether the metabolite profiles supportthe clade-level classification of the plant family. This was done by comparing the aWCDsagainst aBCDs as well as the background distance distribution formed by the aSLDs. TheaWCDs were lower than aBCDs (Fig 1 and Fig 2, S1 and S2 Figs), indicating that the com-pound data was consistent with the clade-level classification. From the qualitative data of lids,all aWCDs were less than the mean and median values of the aBCDs. In comparison to theTable 3.

Finally, the aWCDs were sig-nificantly lower than the aBCDs (Wilcoxon test P-value = 1.42e-05; Fig 2C).

The difference betweenaWCDs and aBCDs was marginally significant (P-value = 0.004; S2C Fig).DiscussionConiine in Sarracenia sp.The presence of coniine has been reported from poison hemlock and twelve Aloe species[22,23]. The only report of coniine in Sarraceniaceae is by Mody et al. [21], who isolated 5 mgof coniine from 45 kg fresh pitchers of S. flava via steam distillation. This is in contrast to theresults of Romeo et al. [11], who did not detect any alkaloids or volatile amines in Sarracenia.We have now confirmed the findings of Mody et al. [21] and also found that coniine occurs,often in low amounts, in at least seven other species, e.g. S. purpurea (Table 2). It remainsunknown where exactly coniine is biosynthesized in Sarracenia spp., since the compound wasdetected both in lids and in the actual pitchers. Biosynthesis of coniine has been studied in poi-son hemlock. In this case the carbon backbone is derived from the iterative coupling ofbutyryl-CoA and two malonyl-CoAs by a PKS, CPKS5 [24]. According to our analysis, genesencoding such enzymes are present in the transcriptomes [32] of S. psittacina and S. purpurea.Both species harbour three contigs which represent two to three PKSs. The exact numbercould not be determined because the N-terminal contig cannot be assigned to either of the C-terminal contigs. The contigs do not represent full-length sequences and therefore it is impos-sible to clearly assign them as PKSs for coniine biosynthesis in Sarracenia spp. Importantmutations might be located outside the observed area, preventing distinction from chalconesynthases involved in anthocyanin synthesis [9,10].An important question is the function of coniine in Sarracenia. Why should plants living innutrient-poor environments produce a nitrogenous compound if there are no benefits? Butlerand Ellison [39] studied nitrogen acquisition of S. purpurea and reported that the pitchers arein fact very efficient in prey capture and could thus greatly enhance the available nitrogen forthe following growth season. Mody et al. [21] postulated that coniine could be an insect-stun-ning agent. Coniine did indeed paralyze fire ants, but probably the tested concentrations werenot physiological [21]. Another function for coniine could be insect attraction, as suggested byHarborne [25] and Roberts [40], who identified coniine as a floral scent compound in poisonhemlock. In conclusion, it appears that an investment in coniine biosynthesis could have adouble benefit by enhancing both insect attraction and retention.Metabolite profiles of Sarracenia and DarlingtoniaThere are several previous reports on Sarracenia volatiles [7,8]. For example, Miles et al. [7]reported benzothiazole, benzyl alcohol, heptadecane and tridecane from S. flava, which wealso found from Sarracenia spp. Nonanal, a floral scent compound widespread in the plantPhytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 15 / 21kingdom [28], was found from Sarracenia spp. lids in our study. The compound is known toattract mosquitos [41], and Miles et al. [7] described it as one of S. flava’s volatile organic com-pounds. The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), another carnivorous plant, emits this volatileorganic compound when it is feeding on fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) [35].Sarracenin (Fig 4A) has previously been reported from S. flava [17], S. alata, S. leucophylla,S. minor and S. rubra [18]. Our study confirmed the presence of this compound in all theaforementioned species, except S. minor, and revealed several new species containing sarrace-nin, namely, S. psittacina, S. purpurea and D. californica. The compound is volatile and attractsinsects to Heliamphora sp. [4]. A possible explanation of why S. minor did not accumulate sar-racenin in our study could be that our samples were not feeding on insects at the time of col-lection, and as a result, they did not synthesize the compound [4].We also found (Z)-13-docosenamide (erucamide) to be a common compound in Sarrace-nia spp. and D. californica. It has previously been reported from H. tatei and H. heterodoxa [4],where it is a possible lubricating component of the nectar.Other common compounds from Sarracenia sp. and D. californica are carboxylic acids(fatty acids) such as tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic and (Z)-9-hexadecenoic acids. All three arefloral scent compounds and the latter is known from Hydnora africana [42]. Hexadecanoicacid is emitted by the Venus fly trap as a volatile organic compound after feeding [35].Sarracenia spp. display a huge variety of unique compounds which are found only in theirlid and/or pitcher. Actinidine is a floral scent compound known from Sauromatum guttatum[43] and an insect pheromone in Hymenoptera [44]. Trans-Jasmone acts either as an insectattractant or repellent depending on the insect species. Pulegone (Fig 4B) is a floral scent com-pound of Tilia sp. [45] and Agastache sp. [46], and functions as an insecticide [47]. 14-β-Pregna is a sex pheromone of the insect Eurygaster maura [48]. Lagumicine was found from S.oreophila lid. Previously it had been found from Alstonia angustifolia var. latifolia [49]. Mileset al. [17] suggested, on the basis of the possible cleavage of sarracenin, that terpene indolealkaloids could be synthesized in Sarracenia spp.The studied accessions of Sarraceniaceae are characterized by a large number of diversemetabolites, with nearly 600 metabolites identified in lids as well as in pitchers. They are alsocharacterized by a huge chemical diversity, as the metabolite compositions of different plantswere largely distinct. Unlike mutation data from highly conserved genomic loci, the data thatmainly displays wide heterogeneity of samples is not suitable for constructing taxonomies.Knudsen et al. [29] concluded that the usability of floral scent compounds in chemotaxonomyis limited because chemical composition usually differs even between closely related species.The composition may also vary among genera of a specific family, as it may vary among speciesof a given genus. Thus, the chemical composition alone is of little use for phylogenetic estimatesabove the genus level. As expected, clustering derived from our data alone does not agree withthe phylogenetic structure of the accessions (see the column dendrograms in S6–S9 Figs).The available phylogenetic information, on the other hand, may help us to understand thecurrent data. We sought to explain the metabolite composition of plants with the known phy-logenetic information from [2]. We successfully demonstrated that the metabolite data con-form with the clade-level classification of the plant family and hence that the phylogeny canexplain the metabolite composition of the plants to some extent. Notably, whereas the qualita-tive data could be largely explained by phylogeny (Fig 1 and Fig 2), the concordance of quanti-tative data with the clade-level classification was relatively weaker (S1 and S2 Figs). Thus, wespeculate that evolution may more directly affect the presence or absence of specific chemicalsthan the exact amount in which the chemicals are present.We have limited the focus of the current data mining to cataloging and visualizing the data.Given the dominance of zeroes, the current datasets may benefit from computational methodsPhytochemical analysis of Darlingtonia and SarraceniaPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171078 February 21, 2017 16 / 21specially designed for zero-inflated or left-censored data. But such a detailed computationalanalysis is out of the scope of this biochemical profiling study.ConclusionStudied accessions of Sarraceniaceae possessed a diverse variety of compounds. Lids andpitchers were studied separately and approximately 600 compounds were detected in bothcollections. The accessions also showed huge diversity, with every accession containing uniquecompounds. Coniine was newly detected in seven Sarracenia species in addition to the knownsource, S. flava. However, we could not identify a specific candidate gene involved in coniinebiosynthesis in Sarracenia spp. Among the common constituents of Sarraceniaceae are sarrace-nin, erucamide, and nonanal. By integrating existing phylogenetic information of Sarracenia-ceae, we successfully demonstrated that the phylogeny can explain the metabolite compositionof the plants. Phylogeny explained the presence or absence of compounds more strongly thantheir concentrations.Fig 4. Compounds identified in Sarracenia and D. californica.
