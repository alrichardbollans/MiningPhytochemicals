INTRODUCTION 
~ 
Leishmaniasis is a protozoan parasitic discase transmit- 
ted to human by plilebotominc sand flics. Thc csti- 
mated global prevalencc is 12 million cases, with 
400 O00 to 2 O00 O00 new cases rcportcd per ycar (Croft, 
1988). The drugs of first choice are pentavalent antimo- 
nials such as N-1iiethylSlucaiiiine antimonate (Glucan- 
time) or sodium stilbogluconate (Pcntoslam) but 
require long-term therapy and often inducc toxic 
effects (Croft, 1988). Morcovcr, visccral leishmaniasis 
clinically resistant to antimony has bccn rcportcd (Bcr- 
nian, 1988). 
In  Bolivia, thc Instituto Boliviano de Biologia de 
Altura (IBBA) and ORSTOM (French Institute of 
Scientific Rescarch for thc Dcvclopmcnt i n  
Coopcration) havc bccn scarcliing for Bolivian plants 
containing new natural compounds active against Icish- 
nianiasis and Chagas disease. We havc investigated the 
leavcs of Muizttozia ìnarorzii (Astcraccac), an abundant 
hcrbaccous plant which grows at an altitudc of 1500 ni 
to 3000 m in  the sub-Andean tropical rcgion. Mulitiozia 
tnaroriii is not uscd in traditional medicine. In a prc- 
liniinary scrccning, a pctrolcum ether extract of the

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Isolation and clieniistry 
Gencral cxpcrinientsl procedures. The UV spcclruni was 
rccordcd on a Unicam SP 1800 spectrophotomcter, and 
the IR spectrum on a Pcrkin Elnier 257. All the 'H and 
"C-NMR spectra were rccordcd on a Bruker AC 200 P 
spcctronicter in  CDCl3 (6 ppm) opcrating at 200 and 
50 MHz respcctivcly. Einis spectrum was obtaincd 
from Nermag R 1010 C mass spectromcter opcrating at 
70 eV. Optical rotation was mcasured in CHCIJ using a 
Schmidt-Macrisch polarimcter type Poiartroriic 1. 
Modclization cxperiments werc performed using a

Plant material. Tlie leaves of Mutznozia rizuronii were 
collected by A. Fournet (A.F. 434) in Yungas (Depart- 
nient of La Paz, altitude 2500 m, Bolivia) in July 1987.

The plant material was identified by H. Robinson of the 
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian 
Institution, Washington, USA. Voucher specimens 
were deposited in the National Herbarium of Bolivia 
(La Paz) and in the Smithsonian Institution. 
Extraction and isolation. The air-dried leaves (720 g) were 
powdered and extracted with petroleum ether. The 
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield 
a greenish extract (61 g). This extract was fractionated 
on a silica gel column (Kieselgel H ,  Merck), eluted with 
pe!roleum ether and an increasing amount of EtOAc. 
The active fraction (6.7g), eluted with pure EtOAc, 
was further purified by silicagel chromíitography using 
petroleum ether-EtOAc (7-3) as eluant, affording 
164 mg of dehydrozaluzanin C.

BioIogical assays 
I'arasites. Cultures of Leislrmnniri and Trypanosomn 
cruzi were obtained from IBBA (Instituto Bolivano de 
Biologia de Altura, La Paz) and identified by isoen- 
zyme analysis. Twelve strains of Leishmrrnia were used 
during these investigations: L. braziliensis (MIHOM/ 
BR/75/M 2904), L. guyunensis (MHOM/BR/75/ 
M4147), L. parinmensis (4039), L. periiuiana (MNOM/ 
PE/OO/SL2), L. amnzonensis (IFLA/BR/67/PH8), L. 
mexicíirzfr (MHOM/BZ/82/BEL 21), L. pvnnoi 
(MHOM/VE/57/LLl), L. uenezrieleti,sis (VE/74/PM- 
H3), L. clonouuni (MHOM/IN/83/HS-70), L.  dono- 
oani (MEIO M/ I N/80/D D8), L. infun firm (LI-I-4), L. 
in filnfrrm (MHOM/B R/001M 2682). 
Fifteen strains of Tryiiunosomíi crrizi were used: 
Z2C14 (Bolivian strain), 133 79 CI9 (isolated from man 
in Brazil), C8 CI1 (Brazilian strain), 31 R l 6  CI1 (iso- 
lated from man in Bolivia), SC 43 CI2 (Bolivian strain), 
A98 CI5 (Original from French Guyana), MIL 4 Cl10 
(isolated from man in Bolivia), M62241 CI6 (isolated 
from man in Brazil), 9280 CI1 (isolated from man in 
Bolivia), CL (Brazilian strain), 27R 27 CI1 (isolated 
from Aotus in Bolivia), Y (isolated from man in 
Brazil), Tulahuen (isolated from Triatoma infestans in 
Brazil), A 97 CI1 and A 99 Cl7 (isolated from Didelphis 
marsupialis in French Guyana) and PB 3 CI7 (isolated 
from Rhodrzius picripes in Bolivia). 
Culture and maintenance col' Leishmnnin. Promastigote 
forms of Leislzmarria were grown at 2S"C in USMARU 
medium (Evans, 1987) containing 10% heat inactivated 
(56°C for 30 min) fetal hovine serum. Promastigote 
cultures in the logiirithniic philse of growth wcre main- 
tained by transferring IO" cells per mL. The extracts 
and the fractions of Mrrntiozifi mnrohii were dissolved 
in SO pL of DMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) and added to 
the medium, from which aliquots were drawn. Parasites 
were counted every day in a haemocytometer and the 
A. FOURNET E T A L .  C '  112 
results were compared with those of controls grown 
without drug. The 90% inhibitory concentrations (ICcx,) 
were chosen for the comparison of susceptibilities of 
the strains to drugs tested. Pentamidine" (Aldrich 
Chemical and May Sr Baker, England) and ketocona- 
zole (Janssen Pharmaceutica Co, Belgium) were used 
ils reference drugs for measuring the efficacy of the 
extracts of Miinnozia mcironii. Each assay was per- 
formed in triplicate. 
Culture and maintenancc of Trypnnosotnn crrizi. 
Epimastigotes of T. cruzî were maintained in con- 
tinuous exponential growth i n  liver infusion tryptose 
medium (LIT, Bacto) supplemented with 10% fetal calf 
serum at 28°C with an inoculum of 10" cells per mL. 
Aliquots were taken every day and the parasites were 
counted in a haemocytometer; the counts were com- 
pared with those of controls grown without drug. 
Nifurtimox (Bayer, Germany) and bcnznidazole 
(Roche, USA) were used for comparison. 
In oioo studies. Fcmale BALBIc micc were obtained 
from the Charles River Breeding and then were bred at  
IBBA (La Paz, Bolivia). Mice were 8 weeks old and 
weighed 1S-20 g when experiments were initiated. 
Leishmnnia ammonensis (IFLA/BR/67/PH8) was 
used. Female BALB/c mice (n  = 8) were infected sub- 
cutaneously in the right rear foot pad with 0.2mL 
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing lo6 amnsti- 
gotes obtained from donor hanistcrs. Tlic growtli o f  
infection was calculated weekly by measuring the dia- 
meter of both rear feet with a direct reading vernier 
caliper (Ref: Kroelin IODI OOT6). The size of the lesion 
in mm was determined by subtracting the measure- 
mcnts obtaincd for the uninfected foot from that of the 
infected foot. Measurcmcnts began 1 day before the 
inoculation of L. amnzonensis and were performed for 
9 weeks. 
Glucantime was given rit 200 mg/kg/d :ind dchydro- 
zaluzíinin C at 100 mg/kg/d. Preliminary studics had 
shown that these doses werc the most effective limiting 
the mortality induced by the clevelopment of L. rimazo- 
tiensis lesions in BALWc micc (Coleman et d., 1989). 
Drug trcatment was initiatcd 1 clay after thc inoculation 
of parasites and was carried on once daily for 14 days. 
The dehydrozaluzanin C was dissolved in 50pL of 
polysorbate (Tween 80, Prolabo). Control mice ( n  = 8) 
received 0.2 mL PBS lor 14 days. For each cxperiment 
the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were 
calculated. 
RESULTS 
Structure determination of the guaianolide 1 
The chemical structurc of 1 was established according 
to its spectral data. The UV and IR spectra indicate the 
presence of a . lactone ring (h,ll:,X=217 nm; 
vlll:ly =1761 cm-I), of an isolated ketone 
(v,,,~,, = 1723 cni-I) and of scveral isolatcd or conjugated 
double bonds. Thc molecular weight of 1 ( m / z  = 244) 
and its 'FI and TC-NMR spectra indicate a molecular 
formula of C,sHIb03, consistent with :I sesquiterpene 
lactone structurc. The sequence of the protonated car- 
bon atoms was established using 'H-'3CC-NMR (COSY)

parison with thc corresponding Drciding modcl and 
litcraturc data (Bohlmann el al., 1980; Bohlmann et al., 
1981; I-lazim et al., 19S0). Modclization cxpcrimcnts 
indicate that any modification in the stcreochcmistry, in  
agrcement with the NMR data, incrcases thc intcrnal 
cncrgy of thc niolcculc. Thc structurc and rclativc

DISCUSSION 
The petroleum ether extract of the leaves of Miinnozia 
mrrronii showed a significant activity on the promasti- 
gote forms of Leishrnmiia and epimastigote forms of 
Trypanosoma criizi. The bioassay guided fractionation 
produced the active compound, identified as the sesqui- 
terpene lactone, dehydrozaluzanin C, isolated for the 
first time as a natural product. This compound was 
previously obtained by oxidation of zaluzanin C iso- 
la t ccl from :i Mcx icn n Ast e r:icc;ic, Zalrr zernir~ wrgiisfer 
(Romo dc Vivar et c i f . ,  1967). I n  a phytochemical stiicly 
of Mimnozicr mnronii (Bohlman and Grenz, 1979). the 
isolation and structure determination of a sesquiter- 
pene lactone was reported but no mention was made 
about dehydrozaluzanin C. A sesquiterpene lactone 
with a similar guaianolide skeleton, dehydrocostuslac- 
ton, was isolated from another species of Munnozia, 
M. giganlea (Bohlmann and Grenz, 1979). 
In our study, dehydrozaluzanin C exhibited an inter- 
esting activity in vitro against extracellular forms of the 
parasites; it was more efficient than standard leishmani- 
cidal compounds, glucantime and ketoconazole. The in 
oiuo studies with the BALB/c mice model of 
Leishmania nmatonensis (PH 8) showed that dehydro- 
zaluzanin C was less potent than Glucantime. In pre- 
vious studies dehydrozaluznnin C did not exhibit direct 
activity against L. arnozonensis in cell lines (Vero, U 
937, and I-IBK9,C1-J. The cytotoxicity (LD%,) on the 
mammalian cells was evaluated to 1 pg/mL (Mufioz, 
1987). 
The activity of dehydrozaluzanin C on the strains of 
epiniastigotc forms of Trypnnosomtr cruzi was more 
pot en t t li an the stand ii rcl drugs, be nzn iclazo le and n i fu r- 
timox. I n  oifro biological assays on the bloodstream 
forms of T. crirzi (trypomastigotes) (Rojas de Arias et 
al., 1990) did not show any activity on this form of the 
parasi tc. 
The data presented in this study indicate that a direct 
comparison between the efficacy of drugs against vari- 
ous forms of parasites is not always evident. It is 
difficult to dctcrminc whether the in oifro drug activity 
will correlatc with its activity in oioo or not (Bell et d.,  
1990). Thc irr oitro activitics of c1chytlroz;iliiz:inin C on 
Lei,s/irtirrnici and T. crrrzi siiggcst that its cfficncy is 
coiiplccl with high cytotoxicity. Thc mcclianism of ac- 
tion of our compound is still unknown. Recently a 
sesquitcrpenc lactone of natural origin, 15- 
deoxygoyazensolidc, has been described as an active 
compound against blood forms of T. cruzì (Chiari el nl., 
1991).

. ANTIPROTOZOAL ACTIVITY OF DEHYDROZALUZANIN C 115 
Murznozia rnarortii often grows with other species of 
the Munnozia genus, M .  gigarttea (Rusby) and M .  
senecioides Benth. Different extracts of these plants 
were prepared and tested in vitro against promastigote 
forms of Leislznzai~iu and epimastigote forms of 
Trypattosoma cruzi but showed no inhibilory activity 
on these parasites. We have collected other samples of 
leaves of Murznozia rnaronii in the distant regions of the 
Department of La Paz, especially near the borders of 
Argentina. The petroleum ether extracts prepared 
from these samples did not present in oitro activity 
against the promastigote forms of Leislzrnarzia or epi- 
mastigote forms of T. cruzi. These results suggest the 
lack of dehydrozaluzanin C or  only a weak concentra- 
tion of this compound in these samples, and suggest a 
variation in the chemical composition of the leaves of 
Murmozia rnarorzii.
