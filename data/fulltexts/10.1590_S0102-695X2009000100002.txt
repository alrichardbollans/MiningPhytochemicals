RESUMO: “Busca de inibidores da enzima glicossomal gliceraldeído 3-fosfato desidrogenase 
de Trypanosoma cruzi”. Nesse trabalho foi avaliada a atividade inibitória sobre a enzima 
glicossomal gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de T.	 cruzi (gGAPDH) de extratos vegetais 
oriundos de plantas das famílias Meliaceae e Rutaceae, na concentração de 100 mg/mL. Foram 
testados 46 extratos, dos quais 15 apresentaram atividade inibitória significativa (% AI ≥ 50). 
A maioria dos extratos de plantas da família Meliaceae (Cedrela	 fissilis, Cipadessa	 fruticosa e 
Trichilia	ramalhoi) apresentou grande potencial em inibir a atividade enzimática. O fracionamento 
do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C.	fruticosa permitiu o isolamento de três flavonóides: flavona, 
7-metoxiflavona e 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentametoxiflavona. Os dois últimos foram ativos na inibição da 
atividade de gGAPDH. Desta forma, as três espécies de Meliaceae testadas podem ser consideradas 
promissoras na busca de compostos protótipos para o controle da doença de Chagas.

ABSTRACT: The inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on 
glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from Trypanosoma	
cruzi	was evaluated at 100 mg/mL. Forty-six extracts were tested and fifteen of them showed 
significant inhibitory activity (IA % ≥ 50). The majority of the assayed extracts of Meliaceae plants 
(Cedrela	fissilis, Cipadessa	 fruticosa and Trichilia	 ramalhoi) showed high ability to inhibit the 
enzymatic activity. The fractionation of the hexane extract from branches of C.	 fruticosa led to 
the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone, 7-methoxyflavone and 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone. 
The two last compounds showed high ability to inhibit the gGAPDH activity. Therefore, the 
assayed Meliaceae species could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against 
Chagas’ disease. 
Keywords: Rutaceae, Meliaceae, flavonoids, gGAPDH, Trypanosoma	cruzi, inhibitors.
INTRODUCTION
Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan 
Trypanosoma	cruzi, affects some 16-18 million people, 
mostly from South and Central America, where 25 % of 
the total population are at risk of contamination (WHO, 
2007). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma	infestans) 
in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination 
of transmission by insect bites, and as consequence, 
blood transfusion and congenital transmission are the 
major causes for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). 
Its treatment is still a challenge, since the only drug 
commercially available (benznidazole) has strong side 
effects (De Castro, 1993). 
The bloodstream form of parasites of the 
family Trypanosomatidae possesses a microbody-like

organelle, where glycolysis takes place, the glycosome 
(Opperdoes & Borst, 1977). The bloodstream form of 
the parasite T.	cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid 
cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP 
production. This great dependence on glycolysis as a 
source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive 
targets for trypanocidal drug design (Souza et al., 1998). 
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) 
is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative 
phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) 
to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BGP). The three dimensional 
structure of T.	 cruzi gGAPDH previously determined 
shows differences, when compared to the homologous 
human enzyme that could be exploited for selective 
inhibition (Souza et al., 1998). 
The need for the development of more efficient 
drugs against Chagas’ disease has stimulated us to initiate 
a project aiming at the discovery of lead compounds 
from several plants of Rutales order. In this way, we 
have proposed the utilization of the glycolytic enzyme 
gGAPDH as a target for the search of new natural 
trypanocides (Tomazela et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; 
Pavão et al., 2002; Moraes et al., 2003). In this paper, 
we report the gGAPDH inhibition activity of 46 crude 
extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants, along with 
three flavones isolated from an active fraction. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant material
The fruits, branches, stems, roots, and leaves of 
Cedrela	 fissilis Vell. were collected in 01/06/01 in São 
Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Maria 
Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, 
Universidade Federal de São Carlos, where a voucher 
specimen (6701) was deposited. The fruits, branches 
and leaves of Cipadessa	 fruticosa Bl. were collected 
in 01/20/01 in Viçosa (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and 
identified by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of 
Botany, Universidade de São Paulo and deposited at the 
herbarium from this department with a voucher number 
110.664. The branches of Almeidea	coerulea A. St.-Hil., 
stems, and leaves of A.	rubra A. St.-Hil., Conchocarpus	
heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani, Galipea	
carinata Pirani (sp. nov.) and Trichilia	ramalhoi Rizzini 
were collected in Southeastern Brazil, and identified 
by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of Botany, 
Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. The specimens 
were deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. 
The voucher numbers and the dates of collection were 
described in Ambrozin et al. (2004).
Preparation of crude extracts
The powdered air-dried plant material (branches, 
fruits, leaves, roots, and/or stems) was extracted by 
maceration three times with hexane, at room temperature 
for 72 h. This process was repeated with dichloromethane 
and methanol for C.	fissilis and C.	fruticosa, and only with 
methanol for the other species. The solvent was removed 
under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the 
extracts obtained were assayed on T.	 cruzi gGAPDH 
enzyme.
Isolation of compounds
The hexane extract from branches of C.	fruticosa 
(12.2 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography 
over silica gel using a hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl 
acetate-methanol gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction 
(6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 
a hexane-dichloromethane-acetone gradient to give 9 
fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using 
hexane-dichloromethane-acetone (6:3:1), affording 9 
fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed 
through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting 
with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (7:2.5:0.5) to 
afford compounds 1 (16.7 mg) and 2 (8.2 mg). Fraction 
6 was twice submitted to column chromatography 
with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (6:3:1) 
giving compound 3 (30.6 mg). Compounds 1-3 were 
characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the 
literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975; Passador et al., 
1997) and submitted to the enzymatic assay.
Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi 
gGAPDH
TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as 
reported by Souza et al. (1998). It is maintained in the 
Crystallography Laboratory of the Universidade de São 
Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.
T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity
gGAPDH activity was determined according 
to a previously reported procedure (Barbosa & Nakano, 
1987; Vieira et al., 2001). Reduced NADH was 
spectrophotometrically measured at 340 nm during 30 s. 
The reaction medium contains 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 
8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 b-mercapto-
ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L
-1 NAD+, 
0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 0.15 mg 
protein, in a total volume of 500 mL. The reaction was 
initiated by the addition of substrate. The extracts were 
tested at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL.
RESULTS
In this work, we evaluated the inhibitory activity 
of 46 extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on T.	cruzi 
gGAPDH enzyme (Table 1). Fifteen of them showed high 
ability in inhibit the enzyme (IA % > 50) at 100 mg/mL.

Screening of Trypanosoma	cruzi	glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitors
The hexane extract from branches of C.	fruticosa (CFGH) 
and the methanol extracts from Meliaceae plants were the 
most active ones, whereas the extracts from Rutaceae did 
not present significant results.
The investigation of the ethyl acetate 
fraction (inhibitory activity = 81.9 % at 100 mg/
mL) from the hexane extract from branches of 
C.	 fruticosa (CFGH) led to the isolation of three 
flavonoids: flavone (1), 7-methoxyflavone (2) and 
3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (3). The flavones 1 and 
2 were assayed (Table 2) and the results showed that only 
2 presented high inhibitory activity against gGAPDH 
enzyme. 
DISCUSSION
The results indicated that, among the assayed 
species, C.	 fissilis, C.	 fruticosa and Trichilia	 ramalhoi 
are promising sources of lead compounds for the rational 
design of new trypanocidal drugs. The inhibitory activity 
of the flavones 1 and 2 against gGAPDH has been 
reported for the first time. Recently, Ambrozin et al. 
(2004) published their activity against trypomastigote 
forms of T.	 cruzi and Tadesmir et al. (2006) described 
the trypanocidal activity of some flavones. A previous 
study showed that compound 3 completely inhibited 
the gGAPDH activity at 268.8 mmol/L (Tomazela et al., 
2000). Thus, the activity of the studied extract (CFGH) 
(Table 1) is probably related to the presence of the active 
flavones 2 and 3. However, their enzymatic activity 
were considered weak, particularly in comparison with 
chalepin, a coumarin isolated from Pilocarpus	 spicatus 
(Rutaceae), which reduced the gGAPDH activity by 75 
% at 93 mmol/L (IC50 = 64 mmol/L) (Vieira et al., 2001; 
Pavão et al., 2002; Menezes et al., 2003; Moraes et al., 
2003; Leitão et al., 2004). 
Similar studies involving the enzyme gGAPDH 
have been reported by our group. Vieira et al. (2001) 
showed the enzymatic activity of several plants of 
Rutaceae and Meliaceae families and thirteen coumarins 
isolated from different species, which are considered as one 
of the most promising class of substances with gGAPDH 
inhibitory activity. Moreover, the gGAPDH activity of 
several flavonoids isolated from Meliaceae, Rutaceae 
and Leguminosae plants, including pyrano chalcones, 
flavones, flavanones, flavonols and isoflavones, have also 
been reported (Tomazela et al., 2000; Moraes et al., 2003). 
Recently, Januário et al. (2005) described the activity of 
7-hydroxy-4’,6-dimethoxyisoflavone on gGAPDH. All 
these data support the hypothesis that highly oxygenated 
flavones possess the structural requirements to inhibit 
gGAPDH.
The family Meliaceae is characterized by the 
frequent occurrence of limonoids (da Silva et al., 1984). 
This class of compounds has been attracted considerable 
interest because of their biological properties and 
diversity of structures (Champagne et al., 1992). 
Previous studies of C.	 fissilis showed the 
isolation of limonoids and triterpenes (Taylor, 1984; 
Zelnik, 1966, 1970; Leite et al., 2005a; Ambrozin et 
al., 2006) and C.	fruticosa has been reported to contain 
ent-clerodanes and labdanes diterpenoids (Rojatkar and 
Nagasampagi, 1994; Rojatkar et al., 1994), limonoids, 
steroids, sesquiterpenoids, heneicosene derivatives 
and one coumarin (Luo et al., 2000, 2001; Leite et al., 
2005a,b). There are no phytochemical studies about T.	
ramalhoi, but several compounds have been isolated 
from the Trichilia genus, such as, limonoids (Cortez et 
al., 1992; Garcez et al., 1997; Garcez, et al., 2000; Cortez 
et al., 2000), lignan glycosides (Cortez et al., 1998), 
w-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids (Pupo et al., 1996), 
terpenoids, steroids (Pupo et al., 2002; Pupo et al., 1996) 
and g-lactones (Pupo et al., 1998). Phytochemical studies 
with other active extracts from these plants are in progress 
and shall reveal molecules that can be used as potential 
lead compounds in the search for potent and selective T.	
cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors.
In conclusion, most of the active extracts belong 
to the family Meliaceae. New investigations with these 
extracts are undertaken in order to find inhibitors that 
could act as potential lead molecules on the described 
assay. Moreover, the isolated flavonoids bring about the 
enzymatic inhibition, showing that these compounds are 
potential lead molecules for the development of new 
drugs against Chagas’ disease.
