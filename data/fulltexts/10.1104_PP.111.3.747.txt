l h e  levels of endogenous caffeine and theobromine were much 
higher in buds and young leaves of Coffea arabica L. cv Kent than in 
fully developed leaves. Biosynthesis of caffeine from 14C-labeled 
adenine, guanine, xanthosine, and theobromine was observed, 
whereas other studies (H. Ashihara, A.M. Monteiro, 1. Moritz, F.M. 
Cillies, A. Crozier [19961 Planta 198: 334-339) have indicated that 
there is  no detectable incorporation of label into caffeine when 
theophylline and xanthine are used as substrates for in vivo feeds 
with leaves of C. arabica. l h e  capacity for caffeine biosynthesis, 
especially from guanine and xanthosine, was reduced markedly in 
both fully developed mature and aged leaves. Data obtained in 
pulse-chase experiments with young leaves indicate the operation 
of an AMP + IMP + xanthosine 5’-monophosphate (or CMP + 
guanosine) + xanthosine + 7-methylxanthosine + 7-methylxan- 
thine + theobromine + caffeine pathway. l h e  data obtained pro- 
vide strong evidence against proposals by C.M. Nazario and C.J. 
Lovatt ([I 9931 Plant Physiol 103: 1203-1 21 O) concerning the inde- 
pendente of caffeine and theobromine biosynthesis pathways and 
the role of xanthine as a key intermediate in caffeine biosynthesis. 
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and theobromine (3,7- 
dimethylxanthine) have been found in more than 60 sub- 
tropical plant species (Suzuki et al., 1992). Many plants 
used for nonalcoholic beverages, such as tea (Camellia si- 
nensis L.), coffee (Coffea arabica L.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), 
and maté (Ilex paraguariensis), contain these purine alka- 
loids (Suzuki and Waller, 1988). The biosynthesis pathway 
of theobromine and caffeine has been the subject of much 
study over the years. Although early investigations im- 
plied the involvement of nucleic acids as precursors in 
caffeine biosynthesis (Ogutuga and Northcote, 1970; Su- 
zuki and Takahashi, 1976), more recent investigations with 
tea and coffee suggest that caffeine is produced from the 
purine nucleotides AMP, GMP, and/ or IMP and that theo- 
bromine is the immediate precursor of caffeine (Fig. 1) 
(Negishi et al., 1985, 1992; Fujimori et al., 1991; Suzuki et 
al., 1992; Fujimori and Ashihara, 1994). In coffee, young 
leaves that are not fully expanded have the highest capac- 
ity for caffeine biosynthesis (Fujimori and Ashihara, 1994).

On the basis of metabolic studies in which the identifi- 
cation of products and the leve1 of incorporation of I4C 
label were based on co-crystallization, Nazario and Lovatt 
(1993a, 1993b) concluded that theobromine is not the im- 
mediate precursor of caffeine in coffee leaves and that two 
separate de novo and salvage pools are involved in the 
biosynthesis of theobromine. Despite an absence of confir- 
matory analytical evidence, the Nazario and Lovatt papers 
raise serious questions concerning the validity of the caf- 
feine biosynthesis pathway illustrated in Figure 1. In these 
circumstances, there is an urgent need for clarification. The 
current report describes an investigation of caffeine biosyn- 
thesis in coffee leaves in which metabolites originating 
from radiolabeled [8-I4C]adenine, [8-I4C]guanine, [8-14C]- 
xanthosine, and [2-14C]theobromine were analyzed by 
HPLC-RC and TLC. The data obtained with these labeled 
purine bases and nucleosides enabled the proposals of 
Nazario and Lovatt (1993a, 1993b) to be examined in detail. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Plant Material 
Leaves were obtained in July and August 1994 from 
4-year-old coffee plants (Coffea arabica L. cv Kent) growing 
under a natural photoperiod in a greenhouse at the Uni- 
versity of Glasgow. The developmental stages of the leaves 
were categorized as (a) buds and young leaves, (b) mature 
leaves, and (c) aged leaves. Young leaves were the most 
recently emerged, and they weighed approximately 25 mg 
(fresh weight) and were approximately 20 mm long and 7 
mm wide. Mature leaves comprised the fully expanded, 
second and third leaves below the apex (weight approxi- 
mately 1.2 g), whereas aged leaves were dark green from 
near the base of the shoot and weighed approxi- 
mately 1.3 g. 
Chemicals 
The following radiochemicals were purchased from the 
commercial sources indicated: [8-14C]adenine (specific ac- 
tivity 1.96 MBq pmol-I), Amersham International; 
[8-14C]guanine (2.1 MBq pmol-I) Amersham; [2-14C]theo- 
bromine (2.07 MBq pmol-I), Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, 
CA); and [8-14C]xanthosine (2.07 MBq pmol-I), Moravek. 
Radiolabeled uric acid, allantoin, and allantoic acid, used 
for co-chromatography, were prepared in vitro from

[2-14C]xanthine (1.94 MBq pmol-’) using xanthine oxidase 
(buttermilk), uricase (Camfida utilis), and allantoinase (pea- 
nut). These enzymes and a11 other chemicals were pur- 
chased from Sigma. 
Extraction of Endogenous Xanthine Derivatives 
Segments of coffee leaves were boiled in water for 15 min 
and homogenized using a pestle and mortar. The resulting 
homogenate was centrifuged at 12,0008 for 10 min, after 
which the purine alkaloid content of an aliquot of the 
supernatant was determined by reversed-phase HPLC. 
Metabolism of Radiolabeled Purine Derivatives 
Segments of C. arabica leaves (5 X 5 mm for mature and 
aged leaves; 5-mm strips of buds and young leaves) were 
incubated in 2 mL of medium, comprising 30 mM potas- 
sium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, 10 mM SUC, and a radiola- 
beled substrate, contained in a 30-mL Erlenmeyer flask in a 
shaking water bath at 27°C. The Erlenmeyer flask had a 
well center containing a small glass tube into which was 
inserted a piece of filter paper wetted with 0.1 mL of a 20% 
potassium hydroxide solution. In pulse-chase experiments, 
after an appropriate period, the incubation medium was 
removed and replaced with fresh medium without the 
radiolabeled substrate. 
At the end of the incubation period the glass tube and 
filter paper from the center well were transferred to a 
50-mL flask containing 10 mL of distilled water, and after 
thorough shaking, radioactivity in a 1-mL aliquot was de- 
termined by liquid scintillation counting to estimate the 
amount of 14C02 released during the metabolism period. 
The C. arabica leaf segments were separated from the incu- 
bation medium by filtering through a tea strainer, washed 
with 50 mL of distilled water, then mixed with 2 mL of 
extraction medium, comprising 80% methanol in 20 mM 
sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, and ground in a chilled 
pestle and mortar. The resultant tissue homogenate was 
centrifuged at 12,0008 for 5 min, and the supernatant and 
pellet were separated. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL 
of extraction medium and re-centrifuged. After three ex- 
tractions, the supernatant fractions containing the metha- 
nol-soluble metabolites were combined to yield a total 
volume of approximately 12 mL, which was reduced to 
dryness in vacuo, and aliquots were analyzed by liquid 
scintillation counting, HPLC-RC, and / or TLC. The pellet 
was treated with 4 mL of 6% perchloric acid at 100°C for 20 
min to hydrolyze nucleic acids, after which the sample was 
centrifuged at 12,0008 for 5 min, and the pellet was washed 
with cold 6% perchloric acid prior to re-centrifugation and 
a further extraction. The three supernatant fractions were 
combined and a 20-pL aliquot was removed for estimation 
of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. 
HPLC Analysis of Endogenous Xanthine Derivatives and 
Radiolabeled Metabolites 
A Spectra Physics (San Jose, CA) 8700 liquid chromato- 
graph was used to deliver a 25-min, O to 40% gradient of 
methanol in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 
1 mL min-l, with samples being introduced off-column via 
a 7125 valve (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA) with a 500-pL loop. 
Reversed-phase HPLC utilized a 250- x 4.6-mm-i.d. uni- 
versal ferruleless column (Capital HPLC Specialists, Brox- 
burn, Lothian, UK), packed in-house with a 5-pm ODS 
Hypersil support (Shandon, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). Col- 
umn eluate was directed first to a Spectra Physics 8450 A270 
monitor, after which fractions were collected or the solvent 
was mixed with liquid scintillant (10 g Lpl 2,5-diphenylox- 
azole in Triton x-lOO/xylene/methanol [11:2:5, v/v]), 
pumped at a flow rate of 3 mL min-’ via a Reeve Analyt- 
ical (Glasgow, UK) 9702 reagent delivery unit, and directed 
to a Reeve Analytical 9701 radioactivity monitor with a 
500-pL spiral glass flow cell. Signals from both detectors 
were processed by a dual-channel 27000 data-handling 
system (Reeve Analytical). The limit of detection for 14C- 
labeled compounds analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-RC, 
operating in the homogeneous mode, is approximately 3 to 
4 Bq (Sandberg et al., 1987). 
The reversed-phase HPLC system successfully separated 
11 different purine derivatives and also was able to resolve 
14C-labeled uric acid, allantoin, and allantoic acid pro- 
duced enzymically from [8-14C]xanthine (Ashihara et al., 
1996).

were also subjected to TLC. Methanolic extracts were sub- 
jected to TLC on 200- X 200-mm sheets of microcrystalline 
cellulose (Spotfilm; Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) us- 
ing a solvent of n-butanollacetic acid/water (4:1:2, v/v). 
Radiolabeled spots, detected after 2 weeks of exposure 
using Kodak X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak), were 
scraped off the TLC plates and eluted from the cellulose 
support with water, and the radioactivity was measured by 
liquid scintillation counting (Ashihara and Kubota, 1986). 
The recoveries of a11 I4C-labeled standards after HPLC 
and TLC were >90%; therefore, it was not necessary to 
apply a correction factor to adjust the data obtained for 
sample losses. 
RESULTS 
Levels of Endogenous Xanthine Derivatives 
Only caffeine, theobromine, and xanthine were present 
in detectable quantities when leaf and bud extracts were 
analyzed by HPLC (Table I). Buds and young leaves con- 
tained the highest concentration of caffeine with about 
one-third as much being detected in mature and aged 
leaves. Theobromine and xanthine were present in much 
lower concentrations than caffeine, and the levels of theo- 
bromine, in particular, were markedly reduced in mature 
and aged leaves. Theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) and 
paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine) were not detected in 
any of the leaf extracts. 
Metabolism of [8-'4C]Adenine 
Figure 2 illustrates the results of pulse-chase experiments 
with [8-I4C]adenine and young leaves of C. arabica. Ade- 
nine nucleotides, nucleic acids, and theobromine were the 
most heavily labeled compounds after the 6-h pulse. The 
radioactivity associated with these compounds, as well as 
7-methylxanthosine and 7-methylxanthine, declined after 
the leaves were transferred to a nonradioactive medium. In 
contrast, 14C-labeled caffeine and C02 increased after the 
pulse period. The accumulation of [I4C]caffeine in this 
manner is in keeping with the fact that the alkaloid is 
synthesized much more rapidly than it is catabolized in C. 
arabica shoots (Ashihara et al., 1996). The data presented in 
Table 11, which were obtained after an 18-h incubation with 
[8-14C]adenine, indicate that the capacity of leaves to con- 
vert adenine into theobromine and caffeine is highest in 
young leaves and decreases as the leaves mature and age.

of radioactivity into theobromine and caffeine. This obser-

C. arabica leaves results in a marked reduction in the incor- 
poration of [8-14C]adenine in caffeine. 
Metabolism of [8-14ClCuanine 
Figure 4 illustrates the analysis of methanol-soluble me- 
tabolites of [8-14C]guanine by HPLC-RC. In addition to the 
guanine substrate, the radiolabeled compounds detected 
included caffeine, theobromine, 7-methylxanthine, allan- 
toin, and allantoic acid. The incorporation of radioactivity 
into theobromine and caffeine was higher in young than in 
mature and aged leaves (Fig. 4; Table 111). This may be due 
partly to a decrease in guanine salvage activity as the leaf 
matures and ages. The decrease in the incorporation of 
radioactivity from [8-14C]guanine into nucleic acids ob- 
served in the older leaves supports this possibility. In 
contrast, degradation of [8-14C]guanine, as indicated by the 
release of 14C0,, increased during leaf development (Table 
111), and this was accompanied by an increase in the leve1 of 
radioactivity associated with the purine catabolites allan- 
toin and allantoic acid (Fig. 4). Most of these degradation 
products appear to be produced directly from guanine by 
conventional purine catabolism pathways, independently 
of the production of purine alkaloids (Fig. 1). 
Metabolism of [8-14C]Xanthosine 
Figure 5 illustrates the HPLC-RC profiles obtained with 
the methanol-soluble fractions obtained from leaves of C. 
arabica after a I-h incubation with [8-14C]xanthosine. Xan- 
thosine is an intermediate of purine catabolism (Fig. 1; 
Suzuki et al., 1992), and as a consequence, much of the 
exogenously supplied substrate was probably degraded 
via this route and incorporation of radioactivity into caf- 
feine was detected only in young leaves. In keeping with its

ylxanthine and theobromine were both labeled during the 
6-h pulse, but no radioactivity was associated with these 
compounds after an 18-h chase. Some of the substrate was 
converted to caffeine, but the majority appeared to un- 
dergo degradation via the purine catabolism pathway with 
incorporation of label into allantoin, allantoic acid, and 
CO, (Table IV). Inhibition of the purine catabolism with 
allopurinol resulted in a marked reduction in I4CO, output 
and an absence of detectable incorporation of label into 
allantoin and allantoic acid, whereas there was an increase 
in radioactivity associated with xanthine, 7-methylxan- 
thine, and caffeine (Table IV). 
Although Nazario and Lovatt (1993a, 1993b) reported 
that coffee leaves convert [8-14C]xanthine to caffeine, Ashi- 
hara et al. (1996) demonstrated that [2-I4C]xanthine is in- 
corporated into allantoin, allantoic acid, and CO, but not 
caffeine, by young, mature, and aged C. arabica leaves, even 
in presence of allopurinol. The metabolism of [8-I4C]xan- 
thosine to caffeine, demonstrated in Figure 5 and Table IV, 
is therefore in keeping with the operation of a xanthosine 
-+ 7-methylxanthosine -+ 7-methylxanthine + theobro- 
mine -+ caffeine pathway (Fig. 1). Radioactivity was asso- 
ciated with a11 of the intermediates in this pathway except 
7-methylxanthosine, which presumably was subject to 
rapid turnover, being metabolized to 7-methylxanthine at 
a rate that precluded its accumulation in detectable 
quantities. 
Metabolism of [2-’4C]Theobromine 
The metabolism profile of the methanol-soluble fraction 
obtained after feeding [2-14C]theobromine revealed that 
theobromine is converted exclusively to caffeine by young, 
mature, and aged leaves after an 18-h incubation period 
(Fig. 6). The total amount of [14C]caffeine to accumulate 
was 1611 Bq (100%) in young leaves, 1064 Bq (66%) in 
mature leaves, and 614 Bq (33%) in aged leaves. This im- 
plies that the capacity of leaves to carry out this 1-N- 
methylation step does not decline with age to the same 
extent as other sections of the caffeine biosynthesis path- 
way, as indicated by the leve1 of conversion of radiolabeled 
adenine, guanine, and xanthosine to caffeine in young, 
mature, and aged leaves (Tables I1 and 111; Fig. 5) .  
DlSCUSSlON 
There is strong evidence that the biosynthesis of caffeine 
is initiated by the degradation of purine nucleotides (Ashi- 
hara and Kubota, 1986, 1987; Fujimori et al., 1991; Negishi 
et al., 1992). In higher plants, as well as almost a11 other 
organisms, purine nucleotides are synthesized by both de 
novo and salvage pathways (Ross, 1981; Hirose and Ashi- 
hara, 1984; Wagner and Backer, 1992). The metabolic fate of 
purine nucleotides is usually investigated using radiola- 
beled purine bases and nucleosides (Yabuki and Ashihara, 
1991). Since adenine is not readily degraded in higher 
plants because they lack adenine deaminase (Le Floc’h et 
al., 1982), it is relatively easy to follow the metabolic fate of 
adenine nucleotides that have been prelabeled with 
[8-I4C]adenine. Although guanine can be degraded by gua- 
nine deaminase, the activity of this enzyme in plants is low 
(Negishi et al., 1994); therefore, exogenous [8-14C]guanine 
is usually converted to [8-I4C]GMP in significant amounts 
by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hi- 
rose and Ashihara, 1984). 
In the present study, adenine and guanine nucleotides 
were prelabeled by feeding [8-I4C]adenine and [8-I4C]gua- 
nine, and the biosynthesis of caffeine from these purine 
nucleotides was investigated. Data obtained in pulse-chase 
experiments with [8-I4C]adenine (Fig. 2; Table 11) suggest 
strongly that caffeine is synthesized from adenine nucleo- 
tides via 7-methylxanthosine, 7-methylxanthine, and theo- 
bromine, as illustrated in Figure 1. The demonstrated 
conversions of [8-14C]xanthosine to 7-methylxanthine, 
theobromine, and caffeine (Fig. 5; Table IV) and that of 
[2-I4C]theobromine to caffeine (Fig. 6) provide convincing 
evidence for the operation of this pathway. These findings 
clearly refute the proposal of Nazario and Lovatt (1993a, 
1993b) that theobromine is not an immediate precursor of 
caffeine in C. arabica leaves. Nazario and Lovatt (1993a, 
1993b) presented data indicating that, although allopurinol 
inhibited the conversion of [8-I4C]adenine to caffeine by 
more than 50%, it had no effect on the incorporation of 
label into theobromine. This implies that the biosynthesis 
of caffeine from adenine involves reactions catalyzed by 
xanthine dehydrogenase / oxidase, and it was concluded 
that caffeine is synthesized from the degradation of purines 
via hypoxanthine, xanthine, and paraxanthine, whereas 
theobromine is produced from adenine nucleotides (Naz- 
ario and Lovatt, 1993a, 1993b). The data presented in this 
report do not confirm these proposals. In our experiments, 
although 5 mM allopurinol strongly inhibited purine catab-

Leaves (60 mg fresh weight) were incubated with 8.9 p~ [8-'4C]xanthosine (2.07 MBq pmol-') for 
6 h in the presence and absence of 5 mM allopurinol, after which the radioactivity was chased for a 
further 18 h .  lncorporation of radioactivity at the end of the 6-h pulse and the 12-h chase is expressed 
as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated into metabolites, means i SE (n  = 3). Total

olism, it also brought about small increases in the incorpo- 
ration of [8-14C]adenine into both theobromine and caffeine 
(Fig. 3). This was probably due to an increase in the size of 
the adenine nucleotide pool facilitated by the inhibitory 
effects of allopurinol on purine catabolism (Fig. 1). 
Biosynthesis of caffeine from [8-14C]guanine in C. arabica 
leaves was also demonstrated in the current studies. The 
relatively high leve1 of accumulation of [14C]caffeine in 
young coffee leaves (Fig. 5A) implies that the applied gua- 
nine is converted to GMP (Fig. 1). Since GMP reductase is 
not functional in plant cells (Ashihara et al., 1992), 5'- 
nucleotidase and guanosine deaminase (Negishi et al., 
1994) are probably responsible for the metabolism of GMP

to guanosine and on to xanthosine, which is incorporated 
into the caffeine biosynthesis pathway, as indicated in 
studies with tea leaves (Suzuki et al., 1992). Although 
[8-'4C]guanine was clearly converted to theobromine and 
caffeine, no incorporation of label into either theophylline 
or paraxanthine was observed (Fig. 5; Table 111). This find- 
ing does not support the hypothesis of Nazario and Lovatt 
(19934 that theophylline is synthesized from guanine 
nucleotides. 
The data obtained in the present study demonstrate that 
there is a marked decline in the rate of biosynthesis of 
caffeine from adenine, guanine, and xanthosine as C. ara- 
bica leaves age, but because caffeine is catabolized very 
slowly (Ashihara et al., 1996), there is not a concomitant 
reduction in the concentration of endogenous caffeine (Ta- 
ble I). The reduced rate of incorporation into caffeine is 
probably an indirect consequence of enhanced purine ca- 
tabolism in the mature and aged leaves, which restricts the 
availability of xanthosine as a substrate for caffeine biosyn- 
thesis (Fig. 1). In contrast to adenine, guanine, and adeno- 
sine, the rate of conversion of theobromine to caffeine is not 
influenced greatly by leaf age (Fig. 6). Whether other com- 
mitted steps in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway behave in 
a similar manner remains to be determined. 
The proposed role of xanthine as a key intermediate in 
the biosynthesis of caffeine by Nazario and Lovatt 
(1993a, 199313) is especially controversial because previ- 
ous in vivo and in vitro studies with both tea and coffee 
have indicated that conversion of xanthine to caffeine is 
at best negligible (Looser et al., 1974; Suzuki and Taka- 
hashi, 1975b) and, more usually, undetectable (Suzuki 
and Takahashi, 1975a; Roberts and Waller, 1979; Suzuki 
and Waller, 1984; Negishi et al., 1985). Reviewing the 
available evidence in 1992, Suzuki et al. concluded that 
xanthine cannot serve effectively as the direct precursor 
of the caffeine ring, and recent studies in which [2-'4C]- 
xanthine was incubated with young, mature, and aged C. 
arabica leaves did not detect incorporation of label into 
caffeine (Ashihara et al., 1996). 
The major discrepancies between our findings and the 
data of Nazario and Lovatt (1993a, 1993b) may result from

the  use of different plant material and  experimental meth- 
ods. Our da ta  were  obtained mainly wi th  very young 
leaves of C. arabica, which have  a high capacity for caffeine 
biosynthesis, and  overall metabolism w a s  examined by 
TLC and  high-resolution HPLC-RC after the  application of 
radiolabeled precursors in  doses that were  usually less 
than  10 p ~ .  In their studies, Nazario and  Lovatt (1993a) 
used older, fully expanded leaves and applied radiolabeled 
substrates i n  doses of 2-5 mM that are well i n  excess of 
endogenous levels. They also utilized a number of “non- 
committed” radiolabeled substrates such as bicarbonate, 
formate, and Gly, whose low leve1 incorporation into pu- 
rine alkaloids, especially i n  long-term experiments, may 
well be  a consequence of the  introduction of label into the  
pur ine  ring and / or  substituent methyl groups via indirect 
secondary pa thways  (Anderson and  Gibbs, 1962). It should 
also be noted that Nazario and  Lovatt (1993a, 1993b) used 
co-crystallization to  identify and  quantify radiolabeled me- 
tabolites i n  highly impure  plant extracts. A s  a consequence, 
their analytical da ta  mus t  be viewed wi th  caution until 
confirmatory evidence, obtained with more rigorous meth- 
ods such as HPLC or  GC-MS, is forthcoming.
