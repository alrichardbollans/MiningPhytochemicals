Através da análise de espectros incluindo NOE e experimentos de RMN em duasdimensões foi realizada a atribuição inequívoca dos deslocamentos químicos de 1H e de 13C doácido 6α-hidroxibetulínico(ácido-3β,6α-diidróxi-20(29)-lupen-28-óico) e do ácido platânico.A novel triterpene, characterized as 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid, was isolated from the leavesand stems of Eugenia moraviana (Myrtaceae), known in Brazil as Cambuí, together with threeknown compounds, platanic acid, betulinic acid and β-sitosterol. Unequivocal 1H and 13Cassignments of 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (3β,6α-dihydroxy-20(29)-lupen-28-oic acid) and platanicacid were undertaken by spectral analysis including NOE and 2 D NMR experiments.Keywords: Eugenia moraviana, 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid, platanic acid, betulinic acidIntroductionEugenia moraviana Berg. (Myrtaceae) is a tree thatoccurs in South America, mainly in Brazil, Argentina andParaguai1. The leaves of some Eugenia species are used infolk medicine for several therapeutics finalities2,3.Compounds such as flavonoids, triterpenes, tannins andespecially essential oils constituted of monoterpenes andsesquiterpenes have already been isolated from the genusEugenia4-6. However, no reports were found on the Eugeniamoraviana constituents. Our phytochemical studies on theleaves and stems of E. moraviana resulted in the isolationof a new lupane-type triterpenoid, which was characterizedas 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (1) together with three knowncompounds identified as platanic acid (2), betulinic acid andβ-sitosterol7. Compound 2 and betulinic acid have beenattracting much attention in natural products chemistrybecause they present biological activities, e.g. anti-HIV8,antitumor promoter9, antimalarial and anti-inflammatoryactivities10,11. Previous assignments of 13C signals 8,12,13led to divergence between the C-18 and C-19 chemical shiftsof compounds 1 and 2 and also between the C-15 and C-21chemical shifts of 2. In the present study we used techniqueslike COSY, HETCOR, HETCORLR and NOE difference,*e-mail: gjvidotti@uem.bracquired at 300 MHz (1H), to report an unequivocal andcomplete 1H and 13C assignment of compounds 1 and 2.Peng and cols 14 reported the betulinic acid resonanceassignment through a combination of high resolution NMRspectroscopy and a computer-assisted structure elucidationexpert system. The authors run 13C/DEPT, DQF COSY,HMBC, HMQC and NOESY spectra, acquired with a 720MHz (1H) spectrometer.Results and DiscussionStructural elucidation and NMR signal assignments of 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (1)Compound 1, mp 285-288 °C; was isolated as whitecrystals. Its EIMS spectrum showed a molecular peak [M]+•at m/z 472 corresponding to the formula C30H48O4 and otherpeaks at m/z 248, 203, 187 and 175, which are characteristicfor a pentacyclic triterpene skeleton of the lupane series15.The IR spectrum showed absorptions due to hydroxyl (3454cm-1), carboxyl (1685 cm-1) and exo-methylene (1639 and879 cm-1) groups. The complete and unequivocal 1H and13C chemical shifts assignments of 1 were assisted by DEPT,COSY (1H x 1H), HETCOR (13C x 1H) and HETCORLR(13C x 1H) spectra (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectral data of1 were compared with those from 6β-hydroxybetulinicacid16. According to our results the C-17 was erroneouslyJ. Braz. Chem.

The antiperiplanar coupling (J6,7a and J6,5a)of 10.4 Hz and the synclinal coupling (J6,7e) of 3.8 Hz forH-6 proton at δ 4.35, indicated that the hydroxyl group atC-6 is α-orientation. The NOE difference NMR experimentwas also performed to confirm the hydroxyl grouporientation at C-6. Irradiation of the H-6 signal at δ 4.35produced an enhancement in the methyl protons resonancesat δ 1.45 (H-24, 5.0%), 0.96 (H-25, 6.5%) and 1.19 (H-26,5.9%), which reveals a coaxial relationship between H-6,H-24, H-25 and H-26 thus confirming the equatorialposition of the hydroxyl group at C-6. According to theobserved NOE enhancements the structure of compound1 should be as shown in Figure 1.Assignments of C-15, C-18, C-19 and C-21 in the platanic acid (2)To unequivocally assign carbons 15, 18, 19 and 21 incompound 2 the NOE difference spectra and a HETCORspectrum were obtained. Initially the proton at δ 3.71 wasirradiated and a NOE enhancement was observed at δ 2.24(H-29). Irradiation of the signal at δ 2.40 provided NOEenhancements at δ 1.61(Ha-16) and 1.10 (H-27).Table 1. 13Ca (75.5MHz) and 2D NMR data of 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (1) in pyridine-d5C δ 13Cb δ 13C (DEPT) HETCOR COSY (1Hx1H) HETCORLR(13Cx1H) δ 1H (2J, 3J and 4J) (2J and 3J)1    38.7  (CH2) 39.3  (CH2) 1.10; 1.70 1.70; 1.10; 1.90 0.962    27.3  (CH2) 28.2  (CH2) 1.90 1.103    78.9  (CH) 78.7  (CH) 3.60 2.014    38.9  (C ) 40.4  (C ) - 1.45; 2.01 (2J)5    57.1  (CH) 61.4  (CH) 1.23 4.35 0.96; 1.45; 1.70; 2.016    69.6  (CH) 67.9  (CH) 4.35 1.23; 1.997    42.6  (CH2) 47.5  (CH2) 1.99 4.35 1.198    40.7  (C ) 42.3  (C ) - 1.19 (2J)9    50.4  (CH) 50.7  (CH) 1.51 0.96; 1.1910    37.2  (C ) 39.6  (C ) -11    21.2  (CH2) 21.2  (CH2) 1.19; 1.48 1.48; 1.19; 1.9812    25.6  (CH2) 26.2  (CH2) 1.27; 1.98 1.1913    38.5  (CH) 38.3  (CH) 2.75 1.1114    42.3  (C ) 43.0  (C ) - 2.61; 1.1915    30.6  (CH2) 30.4  (CH2) 1.31; 1.93 1.1116    29.3  (CH2) 32.9  (CH2) 1.57; 2.61 2.61; 1.5717    48.0  (C ) 56.7  (C ) - 1.3118    48.0  (CH) 49.8  (CH) 1.76 3.55 2.6119    48.8  (CH) 47.8  (CH) 3.55 1.7620  150.7  (C ) 151.5  (C ) - 1.80 (2J)21   30.0  (CH2) 31.2  (CH2) 1.53; 2.2322   34.0  (CH2) 37.7  (CH2) 1.59; 2.27 2.27; 1.5923   28.0  (CH3) 32.1  (CH3) 2.01 3.60; 1.45 1.4524   16.2  (CH3) 16.6  (CH3) 1.45 2.01 2.01; 1.2325   16.8  (CH3) 17.6  (CH3) 0.9626   18.7  (CH3) 18.0  (CH3) 1.19 1.9927   14.9  (CH3) 14.9  (CH3) 1.11 1.9328  181.1  (C ) 179.2  (C ) - 1.59; 1.7629  109.8  (CH2) 110.2  (CH2) 4.79; 4.96 4.96; 4.79; 1.80 1.8030   19.4  (CH3) 19.5  (CH3) 1.80 4.79; 4.96 4.79; 4.96aChemical shifts on δ scale (ppm) from TMS. b6β-hydroxybetulinic acid in CDCl3 and 50MHz16.Hea15eaHH29HHHHCH3CH3CH3CH3CH3HO282726252423222120 191817161413121110 98765432 1OHH29COOHFigure 1.

Soc.Interpretation of the observed NOE enhancementssuggests a structure for 2 as shown in Figure 2 that showsall protons mentioned above in 1,3-diaxial interaction.After the interpretation of the NOE enhancements wewere able to identify carbons 18 and 19 in the HETCORspectrum. The proton at δ 2.40 (H-18) correlates with thecarbon at δ 49.9, and the proton at δ 3.71 (H-19) correlatesthe carbon at δ 52.1. To assign carbons C-15 and C-21, theproton at δ 2.53 (H-13) was irradiated and the NOEenhancement was observed on the protons at δ 1.57 (Ha-15) and 1.03 (H-26). Those protons are on 1,3-diaxialpositions with respect to H-13 (see Figure 2). The HETCORspectrum indicated the correlation between the proton atδ 1.57 (H-15) and the carbon at δ 28.8. The carbon atδ  30.3, that showed no correlation, must be C-21.The complete assignments for the 1H and 13C NMRsignals, as well the 1H x 1H and 13C x 1H correlations of 2are reported in Table 2.pyridine-d5 with TMS as internal reference; CC: silica gel60 (70-230 mesh) and silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh); TLC:silica gel F254 (0.25 mm in thickness).Plant materialLeaves and stems of the plant were collected inSeptember 1996, at the edge of Paraná river, Porto Ricocity, State of Paraná, Brazil and identified by Dr. GrazielaMaciel Barroso, Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro andDr. Lucia Elena Soares e Silva, Universidade Federal deBrasilia. A voucher specimen (HUM 2163) was kept at theherbarium of the Biological Department of theUniversidade Estadual de Maringá.IsolationAir-dried and powdered leaves and stems (920 g) of E.moraviana Berg., were extracted with 95% aq. EtOH(18 L) at room temp. The combined EtOH extracts wereconcd in vacuum and after lyophilization yielded 84g ofcrude ethanolic extract. The crude ethanolic extract waspartitioned with n-hexane (900 mL), chloroform (500 mL),ethyl acetate (500 mL) and n-butanol(500 mL), yielding11.7g (32%), 27.3g (32.5%), 8.2g (9.8%) and 20.4g (24.3%)respectively. Part of the chloroformic fraction (6.0 g) wassubjected to CC on silica gel (101 g) and eluted with differentratios of n-hexane and EtOAc. The appropriate frs (monitoredby TLC analysis) were combined resulting in 11 frs. Frs 6-9, eluted with n-hexane-EtOAc (4:1, 2:3) afforded ppts,which were purified by recristalization on MeOH to givebetulinic acid (603 mg –10%). Fr. 10 (763.4mg) wassubjected to CC on silica gel, eluted with n-hexane, n-hexane-CHCl3 (1:1), CHCl3, CHCl3-EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc, EtOAc-MeOH (1:1) and MeOH. The frs CHCl3-EtOAc (1:1)afforded ppts, which by recristalization on CHCl3-MeOHgave 6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (1) (30 mg-3.9%). Thecombined frs n-hexane and n-hexane-CHCl3 (1:1) (571mg)were subjected to repeated CC on silica gel, eluted with n-hexane-CHCl3 mixts, and flash CC on silica gel, eluted withCHCl3-MeOH mixts of increasing polarity to give platanicacid (2) (25 mg-4.3%). The n-hexane fraction (4.4 g) wasrefractionated successively by CC on silica gel, eluted withn-hexane-EtOAc mixts of increasing polarity which affordedβ-sitosterol (20.5mg – 0.5%) and betulinic acid (180mg –4.0%).6α-hydroxybetulinic acid (1): White crystals, mp 285-288°.
