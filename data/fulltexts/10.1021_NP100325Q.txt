In Vitro antiplasmodialtests evidenced a significant activity of the known gedunin and azadirone and the new neemfruitin A and provideduseful information about the structure-antimalarial activity relationships in the limonoid class.Malaria is still a major health burden in many tropical countries,causing an intolerable number of child deaths, particularly in poorAfrican countries. Almost half of the world’s population is at riskof the vector born disease, and each year, an estimated 300-500million malaria episodes occur, of which 1-3 million cases leadto death.1 This situation is further aggravated by the widedistribution of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains.In fact, a dramatic increase in the number of fatal cases amongpatients having received modern drug treatment has been registeredin recent years.2Azadirachta indica A. Juss., a plant of the Meliaceae family,well known as neem, has been used for centuries by the Ayurvedicmedicine system as a source for the treatment of a wide variety ofailments. Since the beginning of the 20th century it has becomepart of several African pharmacopeias, and, nowadays, the popula-tions of many tropical and subtropical countries use homemadeneem preparations against various illnesses including malaria.3 Theparts of the plant used, the dosage, and the method of preparation(more frequently aqueous decoctions, but also infusions andmacerations) are not well established, since they vary from regionto region. However, either fruits, seeds, barks, or, more frequently,leaves are utilized to this aim. Extracts of A. indica seeds and leavesare also widely applied as pesticides and insect repellents. Theefficacy of such products has been unambiguously associated withtheir content of the highly functionalized and rearranged limonoid(C26 tetranortriterpenoid) azadirachtin-A and analogues.4 Variousbiological effects have been evidenced also in mosquitoes, illustrat-ing the potential of limonoid-rich products for the control of insectdisease vectors.5,6Extensive chemical investigations carried out in the last decadeshave led to the identification of a large number of secondarymetabolites from A. indica, including at least 50 bioactive limonoidswith either insecticidal, antibacterial, antitumor, or antiviral proper-ties.7 Studies aimed at isolating metabolites responsible for the inVitro antimalarial activity of neem extracts have indicated thelimonoids nimbolide8 and gedunin (4)9,10 as the most potentcomponents and likely responsible for the activity. Remarkably,gedunin has recently also been shown to be a potent Hsp90 inhibitorwith potential anticancer activity.11 On the other hand, althoughazadirachtin showed a very poor antimalarial activity on theerythrocytic stages, a transmission-blocking activity of azadirachtin-enriched neem seed extracts has recently been demonstrated in ViVousing a murine malaria model.12As part of our ongoing research for new antimalarial leads fromnatural sources,13-16 we have carried out a detailed phytochemicalinvestigation of the fruit of an African sample of A. indica, collectedin Burkina Faso. This analysis led to the isolation of 10 puretriterpenoid derivatives (1-10), two of which were new molecules,named neemfruitins A (9) and B (10). This paper describes thestructural characterization of these new metabolites and reports onthe in Vitro antimalarial activity of all the isolated triterpenoidderivatives.* Corresponding author.

Prod. 2010, 73, 1448–1452144810.1021/np100325q  2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosyPublished on Web 07/29/2010Preceding the detailed phytochemical investigation of the neemfruit, it was ascertained that this plant part actually containsantimalarial compounds by testing a crude fruit extract in a murinemalaria model (Plasmodium berghei). In mice treated with theextract at a daily oral dosage of 200 mg/kg over 9 days and exposedto infectious mosquito bites on day 3 of treatment, parasitaemialevels reduced by 45% (CI95 40%-50%; p < 0.001) compared tocontrol animals were observed, confirming the choice of this plantpart as study object.Dried fruits (25 g) of A. indica were exhaustively extracted withMeOH, and the obtained material was then partitioned betweenH2O and EtOAc to yield a brown organic extract (2.75 g). Thewater layer was further partitioned against n-BuOH, yielding a polarorganic extract (2.50 g) and a water extract (8.1 g). These threephases were subjected to a preliminary screening on P. falciparumblood stage cultures to assess the in Vitro antimalarial activity. Theresults indicated that the EtOAc phase was the most promising forfurther investigation (Table 1). It was therefore subjected to MPLCchromatography over silica gel followed by repeated HPLCpurifications to afford the new limonoid neemfruitin A (9) and thenew apotirucallane neemefruitin B (10), in addition to the knownmetabolites azadirone (1),17 azadiradione (2),18 epoxyazadiradione(also called nimbinin) (3),19 gedunin (4),20 deacetylgedunin (5),21desmethyllimocin B (6),22 protoxylocarpin G (7),23 and spicatin(8).24 Protoxylocarpin G (7) has recently been isolated from seedkernels of Xylocarpus granatus,23 and this is the first report of itspresence in A. indica. As already noticed in other studies, the neemfruit extract did not contain any azadirachtin.25HR-ESIMS data established the molecular formula of neemfruitinA (9) as C30H44O7. The 1H NMR spectrum of 9 (Table 2, CDCl3)showed seven methyl singlets, two of which (δH 2.09 and 1.98)belong to acetyl groups, four broad singlets between δH 5.00 and5.50, and a number of multiplets between δH 3.00 and 4.20. Acombined analysis of 13C NMR (Table 2) and HSQC data revealedthe presence of three carbonyl resonances (two ester carbonyls atδC 170.5 and 170.1 and a ketone carbonyl at δC 213.8) as well asa trisubstituted double bond (δC 159.2; δH 5.30, δC 119.1),accounting for four of the nine unsaturation degrees implied bythe molecular formula. Therefore, neemfruitin A must be penta-cyclic. The 13C NMR spectrum of 9 contained also the resonancesof two oxygenated methine carbons (δH 5.05, δC 76.7; δH 5.22, δC74.6), one oxymethylene (δH 4.20 and 3.44, δC 72.2), and ahemiacetal group (δH 5.48, δC 97.8).The 2D NMR COSY spectrum of 9 allowed the arrangement ofthe proton multiplets into four spin systems (indicated in bold inFigure 1), one of which is a C7 moiety spanning the sp2 methine atC-15 to the hemiacetal proton and including an oxymethylenebranching at C-20. The HMBC data (Figure 1) allowed theconnection of the moieties and the assembly of the protolimonoid-type neemfruitin A planar structure. In particular, cross-peaks ofMe-19, Me-28, and Me-29 indicated the structure of ring A,including the placement of an oxymethine at C-1 and the ketonecarbonyl at C-3. Analogously, cross-peaks of Me-18, Me-19, andMe-30 disclosed the structure of rings B, C, and D, placing thesecond oxymethine at C-7. Both H-1 and H-7 showed 3J HMBCcross-peaks with an ester carbonyl, thus inferring the attachmentof the two acetyl groups. Finally, the key cross-peak of H-23 withTable 1.

COSY and key HfC HMBC correlations detected forneemfruitin A (9).Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 8 1449C-21 indicated the presence of a γ-lactol ring with an oxygen atomconnecting C-21 and the hemiacetal C-23.Collectively, the above data led to the assignment of the planarstructure of 9. It should be noted, however, that both 1H and 13CNMR spectra of 9 included a series of signals attributable to a minorcompound. However, all our attempts to further purify compound9 failed. Once the structure of compound 9 was disclosed, thesesignals were readily rationalized by the presence of an equilibratingmixture (ca. 3:1 ratio) of the two epimers at C-23. 1H and 13C NMRresonances of the minor epimer have been reported in theExperimental Section.The relative configuration of neemfruitin A (9) was assignedon the basis of ROESY cross-peaks aided by analysis ofproton-proton coupling constants. The correlations of Me-19with both Me-29 and Me-30 were indicative of the cis relation-ships of these groups, for which we have indicated in 9 the-orientation, by assuming that neemfruitin A shares the absoluteconfiguration invariably found for Azadirachta limonoids.Analogously, following the R-orientation of Me-28, the ROESYcorrelations Me-28/H-5, H-5/H-9, and H-9/Me-18 indicated theR-orientation of all these groups. Both H-1 and H-7 must be inequatorial () orientation on the basis of their very small couplingconstants with protons on the adjacent methylenes. The ROESYcross-peaks H-1/Me-19 and H-7/Me-30 further supported thisassignment. The cross-peak of Me-18 with H-20 indicated the-orientation of H-17, while, given the free-rotating nature ofthe C-17/C-20 bond and the lack of unambiguous information,the configuration at C-20 has been left undetermined.Neemfruitin B (10) was isolated as a colorless, amorphoussolid with the molecular formula C32H46O6 (established by HR-ESIMS), implying 10 degrees of unsaturation. The stereostructureof 10 was established on the basis of full 1D and 2D (COSY,HSQC, HMBC) NMR analysis, following the aforementionedapproach for compound 9 (NMR assignment, Table 2). Inparticular, combined analysis of COSY and HSQC spectraallowed the elucidation of the four spin systems depicted in boldin Figure 2, with a large moiety connecting the sp2 methine atδH 5.52 (C-15) with the oxymethine at δH 2.67 (δC 67.0; C-24)and including a deshielded methine (δH 6.26 C-21) branching.Analysis of the HMBC cross-peaks (see Figure 2) allowed theassembly of the tetracyclic system of rings A-D, whose structureis similar to that of compounds 1 and 6-8, with the singleexception of functionalization at C-7, which should be anonacetylated hydroxy group (H-7 resonates at δH 3.98 in 10and at 5.20 in 7). Since this tetracyclic system included sevenunsaturation degrees and two oxygen atoms, the side chainmoiety should account for the three remaining unsaturationdegrees and should include four oxygen atoms. The HMBCcross-peak of H-23 (δH 3.95) with C-21 (δC 96.8) suggested thepresence of an oxygen bridge between C-23 and C-21, givingrise to a tetrahydrofuran ring. In addition, H-21 showed anHMBC cross-peak with an acetyl carbonyl (δC 170.7), thusidentifying C-21 as an acetylated hemiacetal carbon, in agree-ment with its downfield resonance. Finally, since both Me-26and Me-27 showed HMBC cross-peaks with two oxygenatedcarbons (the unprotonated C-25 and the oxymethine C-24), thelast unsaturation degree and the last oxygen atom can both beaccounted for by the presence of an epoxide ring connectingC-24 and C-25. This is also in agreement with the resonance ofH-24 (δH 2.67), a typical value of oxirane methines. Thus, thegross structure of neemfruitin B (10) was defined as a newmonoacetylated apotirucallane triterpenoid.The relative configuration of the tetracyclic core of 10 wasassigned by inspection of its ROESY spectrum and was the sameas that detected for compound 9. The side chain configuration of10 was deduced on the basis of the high similarity of its 1H/13CNMR data with those of acetyltoosendantriol,26 a triterpenoidderivative isolated from Melia toosendan possessing the samestructure of 10 as for ring D and the entire side chain (from C-20to C-27) and whose stereochemical details had been secured byX-ray analysis.26 The observed ROESY correlation of H-23 withH-20 and H-21 fully agrees with this assignment.The triterpenoid derivatives isolated (1-10) were assayed in Vitroagainst D10 (chloroquine sensitive, CQ-S) and W2 (chloroquineresistant, CQ-R) strains of Plasmodium falciparum using the pLDHassay. Results are compiled in Table 1.Interestingly, the tested compounds were found to be more activeon the chloroquine-resistant clone (W2), a behavior previouslyobserved with antimalarials of the endoperoxide class.13-15 Themost active compounds were the three limonoids (C26) azadirone(1), gedunin (4), and neemfruitin A (9), while, on the contrary, theapotirucallane (C30) derivative 10 emerged to be the less activecompound. Interestingly, the EtOAc and BuOH fractions showedgood antiplasmodial activity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.31to 3.35 µg/mL, comparable to those of the most active isolatedmolecules. Given the relatively low abundance of highly activelimonoids in these extracts, their prominent activity cannot beexplained only on the basis of additive effects, but a synergisticaction between the constituent molecules should be taken intoaccount.The comparison of the structures of compounds 7 and 8 withthat of 1 indicates that their different activities should be attributedto the differences in the side chain. Also interesting is thecomparison between the activities of 1 and 2, clearly indicatingthat the presence of a second conjugated carbonyl group at C-16 isdeleterious for the antimalarial activity.It is important to notice that gedunin (4) has been identified asthe most potent antimalarial limonoid of both the bark9 and leaves10of A. indica. We have now found that the fruits of the same plantcontain two limonoids that are as active as gedunin, namely,azadirone (1) and the new neemfruitin A (9). A previous study10identified the conjugated enone system, the furan ring, and theacetoxy group at C-7 as critical for the antimalarial activity ofgedunin (4). The comparable activity of neemfruitin A (9), lackingthe double bond at C-1/C-2 and showing a lactol ring in place ofthe furan ring, indicates that the above relationships, and inparticular the need of a Michael acceptor in ring A, found for theD-seco-limonoid gedunin, do not apply to tetracarbocyclic li-monoids. The pharmacophoric portions of limonoid antimalarialsare evidently still far from being identified. Only a more detailedinvestigation on the mechanisms of their antimalarial action, whichremain elusive, could allow a better understanding of the structuralrequirements needed by an active molecule.In conclusion, the present analysis of the fruits of A. indicarevealed the presence of a new apotirucallane and a new limonoid(neemfruitin A, 9). This latter compound represents, together withgedunin (4) and azadirone (1) (a major component of the organicextract), the most active antimalarial limonoid of this part of thetree. Owing to the importance placed on the traditional use of neemremedies for the treatment of malaria patients, this investigationcould be potentially useful in the view of developing improvedFigure 2.

Optical rotations (CHCl3) weremeasured at 589 nm on a P2000 Jasco polarimeter. 1H (500 MHz) and13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were measured on a Varian INOVAspectrometer. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solventsignal (CDCl3: δH 7.26, δC 77.0). Homonuclear 1H connectivities weredetermined by the COSY experiment; one-bond heteronuclear 1H-13Cconnectivities by the HSQC experiment; two- and three-bond 1H-13Cconnectivities by gradient-HMBC experiments optimized for a 2,3J of8 Hz. Through-space 1H connectivities were evidenced by using aROESY experiment with a mixing time of 500 ms. Low- and high-resolution ESIMS spectra were performed on a LTQ OrbitrapXL(Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. MPLC was performed on aBüchi apparatus using a silica gel (230-400 mesh) column; HPLCwere achieved on a Knauer apparatus equipped with a refractive indexdetector. LUNA (normal phase, SI60, 250 × 4 mm) (Phenomenex)columns were used, with elution with EtOAc/n-hexane mixtures and0.8 mL/min as flow rate.Plant Material. Fresh, uncrushed, ripe neem fruits were collectedfrom the Oubritenga (Ziniaré) region, Burkina Faso, in June 2008. Thetree was identified by Prof. Jeanne Millogo, professor of Botanics atthe Life Science Unit (University of Ouagadougou), and a voucherspecimen (N°2 NFE) has been deposited in the Laboratory of Ecologyat the University of Ouagadougou.Extraction and Isolation. After elimination of seeds, fruits of A.indica were dried (25 g, dry weight) and repeatedly extracted withMeOH (4 × 500 mL), and the obtained material was partitionedbetween H2O and EtOAc to yield a brown organic extract (2.75 g).The water extract was then partitioned against n-BuOH, yielding a polarorganic (2.50 g) and a water (8.1 g) phase. The EtOAc extract wassubjected to chromatography over a silica column (230-400 mesh),eluting with a solvent gradient of increasing polarity from n-hexane toEtOAc. Fractions eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (9:1) were subjected torepeated HPLC chromatographies (n-hexane/EtOAc, 95:5, isocratic,flow rate 0.8 mL/min), affording azadirone (1, 112.1 mg, tR 12 min)and epoxyazadiradione (3, 135.4 mg, tR 16 min). Fractions eluted withn-hexane/EtOAc (8:2) were rechromatographed by HPLC (n-hexane/EtOAc, 85:15, isocratic, flow rate 0.8 mL/min) to give gedunin (4,11.3 mg, tR 7 min) and deactylgedunin (5, 7.3 mg, tR 13 min). Fractionseluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7:3) contained pure azadiradione (2, 118.5mg). Fractions eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (6:4) were subjected torepeated HPLC purifications (n-hexane/EtOAc, 65:35, isocratic, flowrate 0.8 mL/min) to yield neemfruitin B (10, 4.5 mg, tR 11 min),protoxylocarpin G (7, 2.2 mg, tR 18 min), and desmethyllimocin B (6,14.6 mg, tR 19 min). Fractions eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (1:1) wererechromatographed by HPLC (n-hexane/EtOAc, 55:45, isocratic, flowrate 0.8 mL/min), affording pure neemfruitin A (9, 3.5 mg, tR 6 min)and spicatin (8, 2.8 mg, tR 12 min).Neemfruitin A (9): colorless, amorphous solid; [R]D -17.2 (c 0.2in CHCl3); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) Table 2; 1H NMR data for theminor epimer (only resonances differing from those of the major epimerare reported) δH 5.54 (1H, H-23, bs), 3.98 (1H, H-21a, t, J ) 8.0 Hz)3.60 (1H; H-21b, t, J ) 8.0 Hz), 2.81 (1H, H-20, m), 2.25 (1H, H-22a,overlapped), 1.63 (1H, H-22a, overlapped), 0.96 (3H, Me-18, s); 13CNMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz) Table 2; (+) ESIMS m/z 539 [M + Na]+;HR-ESIMS m/z 539.2979 (calcd for C30H44O7Na 539.2985).Neemfruitin B (10): colorless, amorphous solid; [R]D +5.3 (c 0.4in CHCl3); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) Table 2; 13C NMR (CDCl3,125 MHz) Table 2; (+) ESIMS m/z 549 [M + Na]+; HR-ESIMS m/z549.3200 (calcd for C32H46O6Na 549.3192).In Vitro Drug Susceptibility Assay on P. falciparum. The CQ-sensitive (D10) and the CQ-resistant (W2) strains of P. falciparum werecultured in Vitro as described by Trager and Jensen.27 Parasites weremaintained in human type A-positive red blood cells at 5% hematocritin RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, NaHCO3 24 mM) medium with theaddition of 1% AlbuMaxII (Invitrogen, Milano, Italy), 0.01% hypox-antine, 20 mM Hepes (Euroclone), and 2 mM glutammine (Euroclone).The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a standard gas mixtureconsisting of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Test compounds weredissolved in either H2O or DMSO and then diluted with medium toachieve the required concentrations (final DMSO concentration <1%,which is nontoxic to the parasite). Compounds were placed in serialdilutions into 96-well flat-bottom microplates (COSTAR). Asexualparasite stages derived from asynchronous cultures with parasitaemiaof 1-1.5% were aliquoted into the plates (final hematocrit 1%) andincubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Parasite growth was determinedspectrophotometrically (OD650) by measuring the activity of the parasitelactate dehydrogenase (LDH), according to a modified version ofMakler’s method in control and treated cultures.28 Chloroquine wasused as reference control. The antiplasmodial activity is expressed asthe 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Each IC50 value presented inTable 1 is the mean and standard deviation of three separate experimentsperformed in duplicate.In ViWo Antimalarial Activity. The in ViVo antimalarial activitywas assessed with the rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei-Anopheles stephensi-BALB/c mice. Groups of six mice (5-week-old females) were treated for 9 days with an EtOH extract of neemfruits, administered orally twice a day at a dose of 100 mg/kg (200mg/kg/d), or with control solution. The treatment was well toleratedby all animals over the entire period of extract administration. Ontreatment day 3, mice were exposed to ∼20 bites of infectiousmosquitoes, i.e., Anopheles females harboring P. berghei sporozoitesin their salivary glands. The day following the last treatment (day10), the percent parasitaemia was assessed by the examination ofGiemsa-stained thin blood smears at the light microscope (1000×magnification). Reduction in parasite proliferation as a result oftreatment was estimated by comparing the mean parasitaemia valuesof treated and control group mice from two experimentations usingthe Student’s t test.Acknowledgment.
