BRIEF PAPERSjORRECTION OF DATA FOR PROTEIN NITROGEN IN LEAVESOF BRYOPHYLLUM CALYCINUMGEORGE W. PIUCHER, CHARLES S. LEAVENWORTH, WANDAD. GINTER, AND HUBERT BRADFORD VICKERYReceived November 1, 1947In the course of a revision of the method used in this laboratory for thedetermination of protein nitrogen in leaf tissue, it was found that a system-atic error had been committed in the calculation of the protein nitrogen intwo recent papers. The data, as given in these papers (3, 4, 5), suggestedthat diurnal variation in the protein content of Bryophyllum calycin-umleaves takes place. This is not so. The correctly calculated data (tables Iand II) show that the protein nitrogen in leaves of this species is essentiallyconstant over the one- or two-day period that the leaves were studied. Thedata for protein and soluble nitrogen plotted in these two papers, togetherwith all statements regarding diurnal variation in protein nitrogen andsoluble nitrogen are accordingly hereby withdrawn.Table I shows the correct data for the paper entitled "Studies in themetabolism of crassulacean plants: The diurnal variation in organic acidand starch content of Bryophyllum calycinum" (3). These data may beplotted by hand in figure 2 of that paper by those to whom the matter isof importance. In addition, the last two paragraphs under the heading"NITROGENOUS COMPONENTS" should be deleted together with paragraphs 5and 6 under "Discussion" and the fourth paragraph of the "Summary."Table II shows the correct data for the paper entitled "Studies in themetabolism of crassulacean plants: The behavior of excised leaves of Bryo-phyllum calycinum during culture in water" (4). Under the headingCULTURE IN ALTERNATE DARKNESS AND LIGHT," para-graph 4 beginning withthe second sentence, and paragraphs 5 to 7 inclusive, should be deleted. Inaddition, paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, under the heading " CULTURE IN COMPLETETABLE IPROTEIN NITROGEN AND SOLUBLE NITROGEN IN LEAVES OF Bryophyllum calycinumDURING A 24-HOUR PERIODELAPSED PROTEIN NITROGEN SOLUBLE NITROGENTIME LEAFLETS BASAL LEAVES LEAFLETS BASAL LEAVEShrs. gm. per kilo gm. per kilo gm. per kilo gm. per kilo0 0.91 0.67 0.56 0.556 0.90 0.64 0.56 0.5210 0.96 0.62 0.46 0.4624 1.03 0.60 0.53 0.47149 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 6, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1948 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A slightly different techniquewas employed which did not involve the use of the improperly calculatedfactor used in the two papers mentioned above. However, the statementsregarding protein in the first paragraph should be disregarded.The data for protein nitrogen in two earlier papers of this series (1, 2)were also correctly calculated.The authors are unable to find words to express their regret for thecommission of this error and for the waste of valuable space in PLANTPHYSIOLOGY in discussing a spurious phenomenon.LITERATURE CITED1.
