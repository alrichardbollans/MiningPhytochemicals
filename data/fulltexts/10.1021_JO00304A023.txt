Lucidene (l), a bis(benzopyrany1) sesquiterpene was isolated from the rootbark of Uvaria lucida ssp. lucida, 
and ita structure was determined by spectroscopic methods and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. It is optically 
inactive and crystallizes in enantiomeric pairs. High-resolution 'H NMR (400 and 600 MHz) spectroscopy allowed 
the assignment of all protons and indicated the existence of relatively slowly interconverting conformations. The 
three known dihydrochalcones, uvaretin, diuvaretin, and chamuvaretin, as well as benzyl benzoate were isolated 
from the same plant as well. 
Introduction 
Uvaria species have been a source of several new com- 
pounds,'S2 some with cytotoxic? antimicrobial: and anti- 
malarial5 activity. A typical structural feature that occurs 
frequently in compounds isolated from Uvaria species is 
the presence of benzyl or o-hydroxybenzyl groups, as in 
the uvaretins3s6 and some indoles.'~~ Sesquiterpenes 
containing o-hydroxylbenzyl groups occur in Uvaria species 
as well, and three such compounds have thus far been 
r e p ~ r t e d . ~  In this paper we describe the determination 
of the structure of a new sesquiterpene, viz. a bis(benzo- 
pyranyl) sesquiterpene, which we have named lucidene (1). 
The present investigation was carried out as part of our 
project on antimalarial constituents of Uvaria species. 
Lucidene was isolated from the petroleum ether extract 
of the rootbark of Uvaria lucida spp. lucida, which showed 
relatively high in vitro activity against the multidrug re- 
sistant K, strain of Plasmodium falciparum; however, 
lucidene itself showed no such activity.1°

lution MS showed the M+ at mlz 416.2720, which corre- 
sponds with C29H3602 (calcd 416.2715). These mass 
spectral data suggest for 1 a sesquiterpene structure con- 
taining two oxybenzyl fragments. 
The UV (Amu (hexane) 284,277,228,220 nm) and IR 
spectra (KBr, 1610, 1584 (C=C), 1262, 1246, 1235,1221

suggest the presence of two benzopyran moieties in 1.

Only signals which had significantly sharpened in comparison 
with the spectrum at 298 K were included. 
Molecular models of the most likely conformations suggest 
that in one conformation the proton a t  C-19 is in the vi- 
cinity of the ?r system of the C-7, C-8 double bond, while 
in another this is not the case. Apparently, the anisotropic 
effect of the double bond is rather strong and responsible 
for the broadness of the signal at  6 2.08. 
In the 13C NMR spectrum a similar phenomenon was 
observed. Six signals for aliphatic carbons were broad at  
298 K and sharpened to a varying degree when the tem- 
perature was raised to 328 K. In addition, there was also 
a signal (6  124.5) in the sp2 region which was very sharp 
at  328 K, but quite broad a t  298 K. The I3C NMR spec- 
trum showed only 13 signals in the sp2 region, instead of 
the expected 14. Apparently two signals have identical 
chemical shifts. 
GC-MS analysis of the least polar chromatography 
fractions of the hexane extract of U. lucida ssp. lucida 
showed the presence of the known sesquiterpenes cyperene 
(39.3% of the combined nonpolar fractions, according to 
peak integration by GC), 0-selinene (17.9% 1, a-selinene 
(5.5%), humulene (<1%), and several other constituents, 
which were either present in very small concentration or 
unknown. Four unidentified sesquiterpenes (1.3%) 
showed the characteristic fragmentation pattern of ses- 
quiterpenes with an oxybenzyl moiety (mle 310 and 107). 
Lucidene (1) can be considered as an addition product 
of humulene (2), which was also present in the least polar 
fractions of the rootbark extract (vide supra). The ob- 
servation that lucidene was isolated as a racemic mixture 
suggests a biosynthetic formation by a nonenzymatic 
pathway. In fact a conceivable formation of lucidene is 
a double Diels-Alder reaction of humulene with two 
molecules of o-benzoquinone methide (3). Apart from 
Figure 1. 
analysis was carried out. This analysis reveals the presence 
of two enantiomers, one of which has the structure de- 
picted in Figure l. 
The 'H NMR spectrum of 1 taken a t  298 K indicates 
the presence of two ortho-substituted phenyl rings, four 
methyl groups which appear as singlets, and several 
methylene and methine protons. Some very broad peaks 
were observed in the aliphatic region, which were initially 
contributed to impurities. However, the molecular 
structure determined by the X-ray analysis pointed to a 
different interpretation, viz. that these very broad signals 
may be attributed to slowly interconverting conformations 
of the undecene ring. This was confirmed by taking the 
'H NMR spectrum a t  328 K, whereby significant sharp- 
ening of all broad peaks occurred. At  that temperature, 
the multiplicity of all peaks could be established, except 
for the signal a t  6 2.05 (6 208 at  298 K), which was still 
rather broad. The assignment of most signals, as well as 
their multiplicity and J values, were mainly determined 
by single-frequency decoupling experiments (see Table I). 
For example, the methine proton at  C-1OA (6 1.96) appears 
as a ddd (J = 11, 5.5, 5.5 Hz) but actually is a dddd, 
because decoupling of the signal a t  1.55 (H-loa) clearly 
caused line sharpening (J - 1 Hz). The methine proton 
a t  C-19A (6 2.22, m) is structurally very similar to the 
proton a t  C-lOA, but it is shifted downfield by approxi- 
mately 0.2 ppm and shows somewhat different coupling 
constants. Protons at  C-6, C-7, and C-8 show a relatively 
simple ABX pattern, with both protons a t  C-6 appearing 
as a single doublet (J = 7.5 Hz) instead of the expected 
AB system. The C-lo@ proton resonates at  relatively high 
field (6 1.08, dd, J = 16, 7.5,7.5 Hz), almost hidden under 
a methyl peak with the same chemical shift. Decoupling 
of the C-loa proton, however, clearly revealed its mul- 
tiplicity, and its coupling with H-100 (J = 16 Hz). In- 
spection of molecular models suggests that the relatively 
high field position of H-1OP is possibly due to an aniso- 
tropic effect of the C-7-C-8 double bond. 
The most striking phenomenon in the 'H NMR spectra, 
however, is the remarkable peak sharpening a t  328 K, in 
comparison with 298 K. The two benzopyran moieties 
apparently decrease the flexibility of the undecene ring 
system, thereby slowing down conformational intercon- 
version. Some of the signals that are broad in the 600-MHz 
'H NMR spectrum appear slightly sharper in the 400-MHz 
spectrum a t  the same temperature, since the coalescence 
temperature is dependent on Iu, - uBI. The C-19 methylene 
proton at  6 2.08 in the 298 K spectrum, is the only proton 
that still gives a broad signal (6 2.05) a t  328 K. This 
implies that the chemical shift of this proton differs sig- 
nificantly more when going from one conformation to an- 
other ( Iv ,  - us() than the chemical shifts of all other protons. L 
Lucidene, a Bis(benzopyrany1) Sesquiterpene 
reacting as a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, o- 
benzoquinone methide (3) can also undergo Michael con- 
jugate addition reactions to produce o-hydroxybenzyl en- 
tities. Diels-Alder type products of terpenoids, as well as 
o-hydroxybenzyl-containing compounds, are well known 
among Uuaria metabo l i t e~ .~~ ' J~  The three dihydro- 
chalcones isolated by us from the same plant, uvaretin, 
diuvaretin, and chamuvaretin, are also metabolites con- 
taining o-hydroxybenzyl fragments. 
The question whether other diastereomers (ring junction 
methyls trans) and regioisomers (oxygen of o-quinone 
methide bonded to less substituted carbon in cycloadduct) 
are formed as well cannot be answered here, since small 
quantities of such compounds may have remained unde- 
tected. 
Experimental Section 
The melting points were determined on a "Electrothermal 
melting point apparatus", and are uncorrected. Mass spectra were 
taken with a Varian MAT 311a spectrometer and GC-MS with 
a VG MM7070F mass spectrometer using a 25 m CP-Si1 19CB 
column. 'H NMR spectra were taken at 400 and 600 MHz (Bruker 
AM.100 and AM600). All NMR spectra were taken in CDC13, using 
TMS as an internal standard. Infrared spectra were taken with 
a Perkin-Elmer 257 spectrophotometer and ultraviolet spectra 
with a Unicam SP.800. 
Isolation Procedures. The plant material used in this study 
was obtained from Chalinze, Tanzania, and identified by Mr. L. 
B. Mwasumbi, Department of Botany, University of Dar es Sa- 
laam. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of 
the Department of Botany, University of Dar es Salaam. 
The dried ground rootbark (385 g) of U. lucida ssp. lucida was 
extracted with petroleum ether (bp 60-80 "C) and fractionated 
by gravitational chromatography (silica gel) using a hexane/ethyl 
acetate gradient. The first fraction (9.4 g) contained mostly 
sesquiterpenes, and was analyzed by GC-MS. Subsequent 
fractions yielded, in order of elution: lucidene, benzyl benzoate, 
chamuvaretin, uvaretin, and diuvaretin.

X-ray Diffraction Analysis of Lucidene. The crystal 
structure of 1 was determined by X-ray diffraction. Crystal data: 
triclinic, space group Pi; a = 9.417 (5) A, b = 15.899 (9) A, c = 
17.011 (8) A, (Y = 69.96 (4)", /3 = 89.73 (5)", y = 82.015 (5)"; V 
= 2367 A3; 2 = 4; ddc = 1.17 g ~ m - ~ ,  p = 0.66 cm-'. Reflections 
were measured in the Q/20 scan mode, using graphite mono- 
chromated Mo Ka radiation (scan width (Q) 1.30 + 0.34 tan e). 
The structure was solved by direct methods and refined with 
full-matrix least-square methods. A total of 2691 reflections with 
F,2 > 3u(F,2) was used in the refinement. The number of pa- 
rameters refined was 435 (scale factor, positional and anisotropic 
thermal parameters for non H atoms, H atoms were treated as 
riding on their parent C atoms with fixed thermal parameters). 
The final R factors were R = 5.6% and R, = 5.9%. All calculations 
were done with SDP.14 The unit cell contains two independent 
molecules with approximately the same conformation, one of 
which is shown in Figure 1.
