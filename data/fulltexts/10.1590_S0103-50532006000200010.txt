Siphoneugena Berg (Myrtaceae) é um pequeno gênero eugenióide segregado de Eugenia
por Berg. A investigação fitoquímica de Siphoneugena densiflora foi realizada com o objetivo
de se descobrir metabólitos secundários que possam ser considerados marcadores
quimiotaxonômicos e auxiliar na distinção entre os dois gêneros. Cinco taninos hidrolisáveis
inéditos foram isolados do extrato metanólico da casca da raiz e caracterizados como 4-O-α-L-
2”-O- e seu isômero 4-O-α-L-3”-O-acetilramnopiranosídeo do ácido elágico, siphoneugenina,
constituído por uma nova aglicona de estrutura dibenzo-1,4-dioxínica, 4-O-β-D-6”- e 4-O-β-D-

ramnose, casuarinina, castalagina e ácidos elágico, gálico e siríngico. Do extrato metanólico
das folhas, além dos compostos conhecidos como a quercetina, quercitrina, guiajaverina,
reinoutrina, chebulosídeo II, ácidos terminólico, madecássico e asiático, lupeol, α- e β-amirina,
foi isolado um novo triterpeno pentacíclico nomeado como 2α,3β,6β-triidroxiolean-12-en-28-
ato de β-D-glucopiranosila. Todas as substâncias foram identificadas através da análise dos
dados espectrais e químicos obtidos, além da comparação com dados relatados na literatura.
Siphoneugena Berg (Myrtaceae) is a small eugenioid genus segregated from Eugenia by
Berg. The phytochemical survey of Siphoneugena densiflora was carried out in order to find
secondary metabolites which may be considered as chemotaxonomic characters and help to
distinguish between the two genera. Five novel hydrolysable tannins were isolated from the
methanolic extract of root bark and were characterized as ellagic acid 4-O-α-L-2”-O- and its
isomer 4-O-α-L-3”-O-acetylrhamnopyranoside, siphoneugenin, that supports a new aglycone
with a dibenzo-1,4-dioxin structure, 3,4’-di-O-methylellagic acid 4-O-β-D-6”-O- and 4-O-β-

rhamnopyranoside, eschweilenol C, sitosterol, daucosterol, rhamnose, casuarinin, castalagin,
ellagic, gallic and syringic acids. From methanolic extract of leaves, in addition to the well
known compounds quercetin, quercitrin, guiajaverin, reynoutrin, chebuloside II, terminolic,
madecassic and asiatic acids, lupeol, α- and β-amyrin, a new pentacyclic triterpene was isolated
and named as β-D-glucopyranosyl-2α,3β,6β-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-ate. Structures were
established on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical evidence, along with the comparison of
the data reported in the literature.

Introduction
The genus Siphoneugena comprises only eight species
and belongs to Myrtaceae family. It is one of the
specialized genera segregated from Eugenia by Berg.1
Siphoneugena densiflora Berg, commonly known as
Uvatinga, occurs in montane grasslands (“campos
rupestres”), deciduous forests (“cerradões”) and gallery
forests in Southern Goiás State, Distrito Federal, Minas
Gerais and São Paulo States of Brazil.1 That species is the
first one of the genus which has been chemically studied.
Generic delimitation is a severe problem in Eugeniinae
subtribe,1 and chemosystematics must be used to refine,
reinforce or revise taxonomic systems based on

morphological and anatomical characters. This paper deals
with the results of a phytochemical survey of extracts from
S. densiflora, reporting the isolation and structural
elucidation of six new secondary metabolites (1-6),
together with twenty one known compounds (7-27). In
addition, some isolated compounds are being brought into
focus as useful chemotaxonomic features to differentiate
the investigated genus from Eugenia.
Results and Discussion
From the ethyl acetate residue of methanolic extract
of root bark from S. densiflora were characterized five
novel hydrolysable tannins named ellagic acid 4-O-α-
L-2”-O-acetylrhamnopyranoside (1), ellagic acid 4-O-
α-L-3”-O-acetylrhamnopyranoside (2), siphoneugenin
(3), 3,4’-di-O-methylellagic acid 4-O-β-D-6”-O-
acetylglucopyranoside (4), and 3,4’-di-O-methylellagic
acid 4-O-β-D-3”, 6”-di-O-acetylglucopyranoside (5),
along with the identification of the well known
substances ellagic acid 4-O-α-L-4”-O-acetylrhamno-
pyranoside (7),2 ellagic acid 4-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside
or eschweilenol C (8),3 gallic acid (9),4 syringic acid
(10),5 sitosterol (11),6 sitosterol 3-O-β-D-glucopyra-
noside or daucosterol (12),7 ellagic acid (13),8 rhamnose
(14), casuarinin (15)9 and castalagin (16).10 The
fractionation of the ethyl acetate residue of the
methanolic extract of leaves led to the isolation of the
new triterpenoid 28-β-D-glucopyranosyl-6β-hydroxy-
maslinate or β-D-glucopyranosyl-2α,3β,6β-trihydroxy-
olean-12-en-28-ate (6), as well as six known compounds:
syringic acid (10),5 quercetin (17), quercitrin (18),
quercetin-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside or guiajaverin
(19), quercetin-3-O-β-D-xylopyranoside or reynoutrin
(20),11 and chebuloside II (21).12 The dichloromethane
residue of the methanolic extract of leaves led to the
identification of six known triterpenes: α-amyrin (22),
β-amyrin (23), lupeol (24),13 terminolic (25),14
madecassic (26) and asiatic (27)15 acids. The structures
of the compounds were determined by spectrometric
methods, primarily from the 1H, 13C, 1D and 2D NMR
and ESI-MS techniques and comparison of the data with
those reported in the literature.
The small amount and the difficulty of separation, led
us to characterize compounds 1, 2 and 7 as a mixture.
The integration of the proton signals at δ 7.81 (1), δ 7.79
(2) and δ 7.78 (7) in the 1H NMR spectrum beside cross
peaks of these protons with carbon at δ 149.2 (C-4, 1, 2
and 7), a 2J (C,H) correlation observed in the HMBC
spectrum (Table 2), and with carbons at δ 110.7 or 110.3
(C-5, 1, 2 and 7), a J (C,H) correlation observed in the
HSQC spectrum, suggested that the ratio of these
compounds in the mixture was about 1:1:1. Their 1H NMR
spectrum (Table 1) was very similar to that of 8, except
Scheme 1.

for the signals correspondent to acetyl groups. The position
of acetyl groups was determined carefully by cross peak
of the signals at δ 5.42 (H-2”, 1), 5.23 (H-3”, 2) and 5.03
(H-4”, 7) with carbons at δ 74.1, 75.7 and 75.6 (C-2”, C-
3” and C-4” of 1, 2 and 7, respectively, J (C,H)) and a 3J
(C,H) correlation with the ester carbon at δ 173.2 (1, 2
and 7). The chemical shift of ester carbon was confirmed
by cross peak (2J (C,H) correlation) with methyl protons
at δ 2.11 (1), 2.16 (2) and 2.18 (7) in the HMBC spectrum.
1H 13C long-range correlation from the anomeric protons
at δ 5.56 (1), 5.55 (2) and 5.54 (7) to C-4 (δ 149.2) of the
ellagic acid moiety ascertained that the rhamnose residue
was attached to C-4 of the aglycone. Their molecular
formula was determined to be C22H18O13 from the pseudo
molecular ion peak at m/z 489 [M-H]–, the fragment ion
peaks at m/z 447 [M-H-H2CCO]– and at m/z 301 [M-H-
H2CCO-rha]–, observed in the ESI-MS negative ion mode.
Thus, the structure of 1 was assigned as ellagic acid 4-O-
α-L-2”-O-acetylrhaminopyranoside; 2 as ellagic acid 4-
O-α-L-3”-O-acetylrhaminopyranoside and 7 as ellagic
acid 4-O-α-L-4”-O-acetylrhaminopyranoside.2
Siphoneugenin (3) was isolated as a white powder.
IR spectrum displayed characteristic absorptions for
hydroxyl (3386 cm-1), methoxyl (2925 cm-1), acid
carbonyl (1705 cm-1) and aromatic ring (1613, 1507,
1425 cm-1) groups. 1H NMR spectrum (Table 3) disclosed
two singlets in the aromatic region at δ 7.12 and 6.39; a
doublet at δ 4.99 (J 7.6 Hz) and superimposable signals
between δ 4.39-3.40 indicated the presence of a sugar
moiety at β configuration; two singlets at δ 3.72 and
3.63 shown the presence of methoxyl groups. 13C NMR
spectrum (Table 3) revealed 20 signals. Carbon signal at
δ 167.5 confirmed the presence of acid carbonyl observed
in IR spectrum. Carbon signals at δ 101.9, 76.7-64.7

helped to determine the stereochemistry and nature of
sugar moiety as β-D-glucopyranose. Signals at δ 56.3
and 60.8 confirmed two methoxyl groups attached to
one and di-ortho substituted carbon, respectively. The
compound was found to have the composition C21H22O14
by analysis of its 13C NMR spectrum and from the pseudo
molecular ion peak at m/z 497 [M-H]–, the fragment ion
peaks at m/z 453 [M-H-CO2]– and at m/z 335 [M-H-glu]–,
observed in the ESI-MS negative ion mode. HMBC
spectrum (Table 3) showed a cross peak between
anomeric proton signal at δ 4.99 and aromatic carbon at
δ 154.9 confirming the linkage site of the mono-
saccharide at C-4’ of the aglycone. The results obtained
from NOE difference spectra of 3 performed by
irradiation at δ 3.72 revealing enhancement at δ 6.39
(H-6’) and absence of NOE by irradiation at δ 3.63 were
used to locate the methoxyl groups at 5’ and 3’ positions,
respectively. 1H 13C HSQC correlation of aromatic proton
signal at δ 6.39 (H-6’) with a shielded carbon signal at δ
95.5 and cross peaks of this proton signal with two
aromatic carbons in the HMBC spectrum (C-4’ and C-
2’, Table 3) suggested the presence of a dibenzo-1’,4-
dioxin structure.3,16 All of the above mentioned data and
symmetry of the molecule suggested several possible
isomers. We proposed a biosynthetic route for formation
of 3 through phenolic oxidative coupling between gallic
and syringic acid units, followed by an oxidation of
aromatic ring,17 but this could not be assumed to be the
correct structure. A strategy was considered to solve the
problem of the structural assignment, between 3 and 3a.
UV spectral shift reagents were used to find the positions
of hydroxyl groups. When the spectrum was run in
methanol containing aluminum chloride, there was a
bathochromic shift of 14 nm, indicating the presence of
a quelate hydroxyl group,18 but this result was not
sufficient to distinguish between the two proposed
structures. Nevertheless, addition of boric acid and
sodium acetate caused no shift change in UV absorptions,
confirming that no ortho-dihydroxyphenol system
(cathecol) was present at the molecule. Accordingly the

spectroscopic and chemical evidence obtained, the
structure of siphoneugenin was deduced to being that
shown in formula 3.
Compounds 4 and 5 have also been characterized
as a mixture. Their 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was
closely related to that of 1, in particular the signals
arising from aromatic rings and acetyl groups. However,
significant differences were revealed as the presence
of two sugar anomeric doublets at δ 4.94 and 4.60 (J
7.6 Hz), the signals at δ 3.83 and δ 3.48 indicating two
methoxyl groups, the signals relative to a CH2OAc
group, and the lack of the signal relative to the methyl
group linked to C-5” of compound 1. Furthermore, the
negative ESI-MS spectrum displayed two [M-H]– peaks
at m/z 533 and 575, respectively, whose are 44 and 86
u larger than that of compound 1. These data suggested
that compound 4 and 5 had a glucose moiety at β
configuration, being compound 5 with an additional
acetyl group. The location of acetyl groups was
determined at the same way for compound 1. The results
acquired from NOE difference spectra of 4 and 5 carried
out by irradiation at δ 3.83 showing signal enhancement
at δ 6.74 (H-5’) and absence of NOE by irradiation of
signal at δ 3.48 were used to locate the methoxyl groups
at C-4’ and C-3, respectively. In addition, 1H 13C HSQC
correlations of signals at δ 3.83 and 3.48 with carbons
at δ 56.7 and 61.3, respectively, along with HMBC
correlations (Table 2) between proton signal at δ 3.83
and carbon at δ 148.2 (C-4’), proton signal at δ 6.74
(H-5’) and carbon at δ 137.4 (C-3’); and proton signal
at δ 7.59 (H-5) and carbons at δ 141.0 (C-3) and 162.2
(C-7) confirmed the linkages of methoxyl groups at
carbons C-3 and C-4’ of the aglycone. Long-range
correlation between anomeric proton at δ 4.94 with C-
4 at δ 154.1 revealed the bonding site of the sugar. Thus,
compound 4 was characterized as 3,4’-di-O-methyl-
ellagic acid 4-O-β-D-6”-O-acetylglucopyranoside and
compound 5 as 3,4’-di-O-methylellagic acid 4-O-β-D-
3”, 6”-di-O-acetylglucopyranoside.
Compound 6 was obtained as a white amorphous
powder. The 1H NMR, 1H 13C HSQC and 13C (DEPT) NMR
spectra (Table 4) indicated the presence of seven tertiary
methyl groups, an olefinic proton H-12 coupled with a
carbon at δ 123.5, a quaternary carbon at δ 143.9 (C-13),
and a β-18 proton at δ 3.19 (dd, 4.1 and 13.2 Hz), that are
typical signals of an oleanene skeleton. Moreover, an
anomeric proton signal at δ 6.28, in addition with several
signals between δ 4.01-4.45, confirmed the presence of a
hexose unit. The relative stereochemistry and nature of
the sugar moiety were determined as β-D-glucopyranose
on the basis of the characteristic J1,2 coupling constant of
its anomeric proton (J 8.0 Hz) and typical 1H and 13C NMR
shifts.19 The ester linkage was located at C-28 with the δ
shifted downfield from 180.1 (its aglycone)20 to 176.9,
and C-1’ anomeric carbon at δ 96.2. In addition, HMBC
spectrum (Table 4) displayed a cross peak between C-28
and H-1’, confirming the linkage site of the mono-
saccharide at C-28. 1H-1H COSY (Table 4) couplings
between proton signal at δ 2.30 (H-1a) with 1.39 (H-1b)
and 4.29 (H-2), respectively, and 1H-13C HSQC correlation
of the carbon signal at δ 50.4 with the proton signal at δ
2.30 (H-1a) became possible the doubtless assignments
for H-1a and H-1b, which are changed with H19a and
H19b in the literature.20 Furthermore, the negative ESI-
MS spectrum displayed a pseudo molecular ion at m/z
649 [M-H]– and a fragment ion peak at m/z 487 [M-H-
glu]–, and the molecular formula was determined as
C36H58O10. Thus, compound 6 was assigned as 28-β-D-
glucopyranosyl-6β-hydroxymaslinate.
The occurrence of triterpenes in leaves of Myrtaceae
is high and frequent,21 but terminolic (25) and
madecassic (26) acids have only been recently reported
in Syzygium ,14 and compound 25  in Myrtus .22
Chebuloside II (21), a pentacyclic triterpene glucoside,
has been previously isolated from Terminalia chebula
(Combretaceae),12 but this is the first report of this
compound from the family Myrtaceae. The glycosidic
pattern of the found flavonols (17-20) is a simple one

and this is in keeping with the primitive morphological
features of the family Myrtaceae.23 Tannin 7, initially
found in Combretaceae,2 and tannin 8, in Lecy-
thidaceae,3 are being reported for the first time in
Myrtaceae together with compounds 1 and 2, although
some methoxylated derivatives were reported for
Eucalyptus globulus.24,25 Similar compounds to tannins
4 and 5 were found in Eucalyptus polyanthemos.26
According to Hillis and Yazaki,27 those ellagitannins
have rarely been reported possibly to the difficulties in
their isolation, purification and identification. In
addition, some of them present poor solubility. All the
tannins found in this phytochemical survey, except for
15 and 16, have not yet been reported to occur in
Eugenia and might be considered as chemical features
for taxonomic purposes, justifying the segregation of
Siphoneugena from that genus by Berg.1 Moreover,
tannin 3 presents a new aglycone type for hydrolysable
tannins and might also be taken into account as a
valuable taxonomic character.

Plant material
Siphoneugena densiflora Berg (Myrtaceae) was
collected in July, 2000, in Poços de Caldas city, Minas
Gerais State, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Marcos Sobral.
A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the
Botany Department (SPF), University of São Paulo, São
Paulo State, Brazil.
Extraction
The air-dried powdered root bark (0.4 kg) and leaves
(0.9 kg) of S. densiflora were extracted with hexane and
MeOH through percolation processing at room temperature.
Crude extracts were obtained after filtration and removal
of the solvents under vacuum at 40 oC. The methanolic
extracts of root bark (RME, 73.2 g) and leaves (LME, 70.0
g) were dissolved in H2O/MeOH 1:1 (v/v) and fractionated
through liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing
polarity (CH2Cl2, EtOAc). The solvents were removed to
yield the residues RMED (0.9 g), RMEAc (10.5 g), LMED
(9.5 g) and LMEAc (14.6 g).
Methanolic extract of root bark – isolation
9.1 g of RMEAc were subjected to CC using silica gel

7:3 as eluent. 14 fractions of 30 mL were collected and
pooled into nine fractions. Fraction four (R12f4) was
identified as 9 (white powder, 50.0 mg), fraction seven
(R12f7) as compound 8 (pale yellow powder, 60.0 mg),
and fraction nine (R12f9) as a mixture of compounds 4
and 5 (white powder, 3.0 mg). Fraction 18 (R18, 698.0
mg) was subjected to XAD-7 (67.0 x 4.0 cm) using MeOH
as eluent. Ten fractions of 200 mL were collected and
pooled into four. Fraction one (R18a) was further purified
by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, 10
x 300 mm, mobile phase MeOH, flow-rate 2 mL min-1; λ
330 nm) to yield compound 13 (pale yellow powder,
second peak, 109.4 mg) after one cycle of 74 min. Two-
hundred and forty milligrams of fraction 19 (R19, 434.5
mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (52.0 x
3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent. Thirty-one fractions of
30 mL were collected and pooled into eight fractions.
Fraction eight (R19h, 127.6 mg) was rechromatographed
over Sephadex LH-20 (52.0 x 3.0 cm) using MeOH as
eluent. Thirty-six fractions of 30 mL were collected and
pooled into ten fractions. Fraction eight (R19h8) was
identified as compound 16 (brown powder, 75.0 mg) and
fraction ten (R19h10) as 15 (brown powder, 19.6 mg).
The twentieth fraction (R20, 358.0 mg) was chroma-
tographed on Sephadex LH-20 (31.0 x 3.0 cm) using
MeOH as eluent. Twenty-four fractions of 30 mL were
collected and pooled into 8 fractions. The first fraction
(R20A, 74.0 mg) was further purified by reversed-phase
HPLC (column Hypersil ODS/C18, 10 x 300 mm; mobile
phase 70% MeOH aqueous solution; flow-rate 2 mL
min-1; λ 300 nm). The peak with retention time of 20 min
rendered an unseparated mixture of 1, 2 and 7 (pale yellow
powder, 8.2 mg).
