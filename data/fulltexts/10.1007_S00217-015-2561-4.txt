Introduction
Black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) fruit is known as 
a potent source of phenolic compounds, especially antho-
cyanins and proanthocyanidins [1–4]. Nevertheless, choke-
berry berries are rarely consumed directly because of their 
specific organoleptic properties, such as unpleasant astrin-
gent taste and their smell of bitter almonds [5]. So, it is 
preferable to use them for syrup, juice, jam, liqueur, and 
wine production. Moreover, processed berries have better 
flavor and are less bitter than the fresh fruits. One of the 
valuable products is chokeberry juice because one liter of 
the juice can contain up to 9 g of polyphenols, and choke-
berry juice is one of the richest sources of these natural 
antioxidants among fruit juices [6].
An interest in chokeberry juices production has 
increased considerably in recent years, with a grow-
ing number of reports on their potential health benefits. 
Results of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that choke-
berry juice has cardioprotective [7, 8], hepatoprotective [9], 
and anti-diabetic effects [1] as well as anticancer activity 
[10]. Recent human studies also showed that Aronia mel-
anocarpa juice may be useful in the treatment of obesity 
disorders [11]. Black chokeberry constituents may help 
in reducing dietary fat absorption by inhibiting digestive 
lipases activity. Pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of 
black chokeberry extracts has been shown in in vitro stud-
ies using simple, different p-nitrophenyl esters or 4-methy-
lumbelliferyl oleate as substrates [12, 13]. The cited studies 
have shown anti-lipase activity dependence on the method 
of lipase activity determination [12] and on type of extrac-
tion agent [13].
Despite the data on anti-lipase activity of black choke-
berry fruit extracts, there are no studies concerning 
Abstract Inhibition of digestive lipases refers to the sup-
pression of dietary fat absorption and, to some extent, to 
a strategy against overweight and obesity. In this study, 
the effect of five commercial black chokeberry juices on 
pancreatic lipase as a key enzyme relevant to obesity was 
investigated using as substrates triolein, sunflower oil, 
and rapeseed oil emulsions as well as 4-methylumbellif-
eryl oleate. The juices were also analyzed for antioxidant 
capacity (ABTS·+, DPPH·, FRAP methods), qualitative and 
quantitative composition of phenolic compounds and nutri-
ents. Significant differences were observed among their 
chemical compositions and biological activities. Choke-
berry juices were rich in proanthocyanidins, followed by 
the hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols. 
Their inhibitory activity against pancreatic lipase was 
related to polyphenol content, that of proanthocyanidins. 
The results reported herein have shown the influence of 
proanthocyanidin degree of polymerization on the inhibi-
tory activity, especially in lipid emulsions. In conclusion, 
this work suggests that chokeberry juice may be a potential 
source of dietary fat absorption inhibitors, especially if it 
contains high molecular phenolic compounds.

chokeberry juices. The need for such data still exists due 
to insufficient intake of unprocessed berries, changes of 
bioactive compounds during chokeberry juice produc-
tion, and increasing interest in healthy food consumption. 
Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the 
inhibitory activities of five commercial 100 % black choke-
berry juices against porcine pancreatic lipase using differ-
ent in vitro assays. The pancreatic lipase is one of the most 
widely studied targets for phytochemicals acting as anti-
obesity agents because it is responsible for the hydroly-
sis of 50–70 % of total dietary fats in the intestinal lumen 
[14]. Because in gastrointestinal tract the substrates for the 
water-soluble pancreatic lipase are usually lipid droplets 
embedded in an aqueous medium [15], we decided to use 
systems with triolein (glycerol trioleate), rapeseed oil, and 
sunflower oil emulsions in order to better simulate physi-
ological conditions. Porcine pancreatic lipase activity was 
also determined by the method using 4-methylumbelliferyl 
oleate (4-MUO) as substrate because of its wide applica-
tion. Basic chemical composition and qualitative and quan-
titative phenolic compounds composition as well as antiox-
idant capacity of juices were also evaluated.

purchased from TransMIT (Gießen, Germany), and procya-
nidin B1 from PhytoLab (Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany). 
Acetic acid was obtained from J.T. Baker (Łódz´, Poland). 
Sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate were purchased 
from Chempur (Piekary S´la˛skie, Poland). Other reagents 
were obtained from POCH (Gliwice, Poland). Ultrapure 
water (Simplicity™ Water Purification System, Millipore, 
Marlborough, MA, USA) was used to prepare all solutions.
Quality parameters
Total soluble solids, pH, organic acids, and sugars con-
tents were evaluated as quality indexes. The pH values 
were measured using a pH-meter (CyberScan pH 510, 
Eutech Instruments, Singapore). The total soluble sol-
ids were recorded in a refractometer Abbe 2 WAY (Vanco 
Industries, Ningbo, China) at 20 °C, with values being 
expressed as °Brix. Individual sugars (glucose, fructose, 
sucrose) and sorbitol were determined by HPLC method 
described by Sójka and Król [16] using Aminex HPX87C 
column (300 × 7.8 mm) from BioRad (Hercules, Califor-
nia, USA) at 85 °C and the refractive index (RI) detector 
(Knauer K-2301) with a Knauer integrating system (Ber-
lin, Germany). The mobile phase was water, and the flow 
rate was 0.5 ml/min. The injection volume was 20 µl. The 
juice before injection was cleaned on SPE column con-
taining cation exchanger resin Amberlite IR120 and anion 
exchanger resin Amberlite IRA420 at a volumetric ratio of 
1:2. The results were expressed as gram of individual sugar 
per 1 l of juice. Individual organic acids (citric, malic, 
oxalic, and tartaric) were analyzed by HPLC method using 
the HPLC Knauer system (Berlin, Germany) consisted of 
a UV–Vis detector set at 210 nm and a LiChrospher-100 
RP-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm) operated at 25 °C. 
The isocratic mobile phase consisted of mixture of 0.5 % 
water solution of diammonium hydrogen phosphate 
adjusted to pH 2.24 with phosphoric acid and acetonitrile 
(99.98:0.02, v/v). Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 
1 ml/min. The injection volume was 20 µl. The juices were 
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and each supernatant 
was filtered through a 0.20-μm Minisart RC4 filter (Sar-
torius, Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) before injection 
into the HPLC system. The results were expressed as gram 
of individual organic acid per 1 l of juice.
Spectrophotometric determination of phenolic 
compounds
Total phenolics content was determined using Folin–Cio-
calteu reagent as we described in our previous work [12]. 
The absorbance of reaction mixture (juice, Folin–Ciocalteu 
reagent, sodium carbonate, and water) was read at 760 nm 
after 20 min incubation at ambient temperature. Total phe-
nolics content was expressed as g of gallic acid equiva-
lents (GAE) per 1 l of juice. Total anthocyanins content 
507Eur Food Res Technol (2016) 242:505–515 
1 3
was quantified by a pH-differential [6]. Juices were diluted 
(50–200 times) with two buffer solutions at pH 1 and 4.5, 
and absorbance was measured at 515 and 700 nm after 1 h 
incubation at ambient temperature in the dark. The results 
were expressed as g of cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents 
(CGE) per 1 l of juice using a molar extinction of cyani-
din 3-glucoside of 26,900 l/mol cm and molar weight of 
449.2 g/mol. The content of total proanthocyanidins in 
juices was determined after acid depolymerization to the 
corresponding anthocyanidins as described by Rösch et al. 
[17]. In fact, 0.1 ml of diluted (2–20 times) juice was mixed 
with 9.9 ml of a solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
in n-butanol (1:9, v/v) and heated for 90 min in a boiling 
water bath. After cooling in ice, the absorbance of sample 
was measured at 550 nm. The content of proanthocyanidins 
was calculated by the molar extinction coefficient of cyani-
din (ε = 17,360 l/mol cm and molar mass 287 g/mol) and 
was expressed as gram of cyanidin equivalents (CYE) per 
l l of juice.
Identification of individual phenolic compounds 
by UPLC–MS
Phenolic compounds were identified using the Acquity 
UPLC system coupled with a quadrupole–time-of-flight 
(Q-TOF) MS instrument (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, 
USA) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Sepa-
ration was achieved on an AcquityTM BEH C18 column 
(100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm; Waters). The mobile phase was a 
mixture of 0.1 % formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B). The 
gradient program was as follows: initial conditions—1 % 
B in A, 12 min—25 % B in A, 12.5 min—100 % B, 
13.5 min—1 % B in A. The flow rate was 0.42 ml/min, and 
the injection volume was 5 µl. The column was operated at 
30 °C. The major operating parameters for the Q-TOF–MS 
were described in the previous work [18]. The juices were 
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and each supernatant 
was filtered through a 0.20-μm Minisart RC4 filter (Sar-
torius, Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) before injection 
into the UPLC system. The data were collected by Mass-
LynxTM V 4.1 software. Polyphenolic compounds were 
putatively identified using their UV–Vis characteristic, MS, 
and MS2 properties using data gathered in-house and from 
the literature.
Quantitative determination of phenolics by HPLC
Phenolic compounds were quantified using Dionex HPLC 
system (Germering, Germany) equipped with the Ultimate 
3000 model diode array detector. The detector cooperated 
with the LPG-3400A pump, EWPS-3000SI autosampler, 
column thermostat TCC-3000SD, and Chromeleonv 6.8 
software. Cadenza Imtakt column C5-C18 (75 × 4.6 mm) 
with a guard column was used. The mobile phase was com-
posed of solvent A (4.5 % formic acid, v/v) and solvent B 
(acetonitrile). The elution system was as follows: 0–1 min 
5 % B; 20 min 25 % B; 21 min 100 % B; 26 min 100 % 
B; 27 min 5 % B. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 
1.0 ml/min, and the injection volume was 20 μl. The col-
umn was operated at 30 °C. The runs were monitored at 
245 nm (protocatechuic acid and depside), 280 nm (fla-
vanone), 320 nm (phenolic acids), 360 nm (flavonols), and 
520 nm (anthocyanins) wavelengths. Caffeoylquinic acid 
isomers were quantified as 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, p-cou-
maric acid derivatives as p-coumaric acid, anthocyanins as 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin derivatives as quercetin 
3-O-glucoside, izorhamnetin derivative as isorhamnetin 
3-O-galactoside, and protocatechuic acid and depside 1 as 
protocatechuic acid, eriodictyol 7-glucuronide as narin-
genin. The results were calculated as mg of compound in 
1 l of juice.
Determination of mean degree of polymerization 
of proanthocyanidins
Acid-catalyzed degradation of polymeric proanthocya-
nidins in the excess of phloroglucinol was used to deter-
mine proanthocyanidins mean degree of polymerization 
(mDP). Direct phloroglucinolysis of freeze-dried choke-
berry juices (40–60 mg) was performed as described 
Wojdyło et al. [19]. The products of acid degradation of 
proanthocyanidins were separated by the use of the HPLC 
system (Waters, Milford, MA) that consisted of a gradient 
pump (1525), fluorescence detector (2475), auto-injector 
(2707), and Breeze 2 system controller equipped with a 
250 × 4.6 mm id, 5 µm Symmetry C18 column (Waters). 
The mobile phase was a binary gradient with A, water/ace-
tic acid (97.5:2.5, v/v), and B, water/acetonitrile (20:80, 
v/v), with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the gradient program 
used was according to Sójka et al. [20]. The injection vol-
ume was 20 μl. The fluorescence detection was recorded at 
an excitation wavelength of 278 nm and an emission wave-
length of 360 nm. The calibration curves, which were based 
on peak area, were established using (+)-catechin, (−)-epi-
catechin, procyanidins B1, B2, and B3 after hydrolysis 
reaction as (+)-catechin-phloroglucinol and (−)-epicate-
chin-phloroglucinol adducts standards. The mDP was cal-
culated as the molar ratio of all the flavan-3-ol units (phlo-
roglucinol adducts + terminal units) to (−)-epicatechin and 
(+)-catechin, which correspond to terminal units.
Assays for pancreatic lipase activity
The release of free fatty acids from three emulsified lipids (i.e., 
triolein, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil) catalyzed by porcine 
pancreatic lipase was calculated on the basis of the volume of 
508 Eur Food Res Technol (2016) 242:505–515
1 3
NaOH added as described in our previous work [21]. Titration 
was carried out using an automatic pH–stat titrator (SCHOTT 
Instruments GmbH). All assays were carried out at 37 °C and 
pH 7.4. The oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by mechan-
ical stirring of lipid substrates with 20 mM Tris-base buffer 
(pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1.3 mM CaCl2, and 
bile acids (triolein emulsion) or both bile acids and gum arabic 
(oil emulsions) in high-speed blender (PRO200, Bioeko) in an 
ice bath for 5 min at 20,000 rpm. Triolein emulsion contained 
2.34 g of triolein, 1.56 g of bile acids, and 100 ml of buffer, 
while oil emulsion included 4 g of oil, 1 g of bile acids and 1 g 
of gum arabic, and 100 ml of buffer. Pancreatic lipase was dis-
solved in the same Tris-base buffer at 10 mg/ml and then cen-
trifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Directly before analysis, the 
juices were adjusted to pH 7.2–7.4 with 6 M NaOH (the ini-
tial pH values were 3.42–3.72). Briefly, 4 ml of the emulsified 
substrate solution and 2 ml of juice or buffer (control sample) 
were transferred into a clean 25-ml glass bottle. The reaction 
mixtures were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before adding 
lipase supernatant—0.5 ml into triolein emulsion or 1 ml into 
oil emulsion. For each sample, a separate blank without lipase 
was used for background subtraction. Finally, the reaction 
mixtures were incubated in a shaking bath (200 rpm) at 37 °C 
for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 14 ml of 
ethanol, and the resultant mixture was automatically titrated to 
pH 8 using a pH–stat with 10 mM NaOH solution. All sam-
ples were assayed in triplicate. The inhibition of lipase activity 
(percentage) was calculated using the following formula:
of inhibition rate against the juice concentration. The lower 
IC50 indicates the higher anti-lipase activity.
Analysis of antioxidant capacity
Free radical scavenging activity of chokeberry juices using 
the free radical cation ABTS·+ was performed as described 
by Re et al. [22]. The DPPH scavenging radical assay was 
conducted according to Kim et al. [23]. FRAP was per-
formed according to Benzie and Strain [24]. For all methods, 
juices were diluted with water 30–400 times. The antioxi-
dant capacity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 
734 nm after 6 min of reaction with the radical (ABTS·+), at 
517 nm after 30 min (DPPH·), and at 593 after 10 min for 
FRAP. For all methods, standard curves were prepared using 
different concentrations of Trolox (water-soluble derivative 
of vitamin E). The results obtained were expressed as mmol 
Trolox equivalents (TE) per 1 l of juice.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Data were analyzed 
by means of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A 
Duncan post hoc test was used to determine differences 
between the means with significance level p < 0.05. Pear-
son’s correlation coefficients (r) were determined using 
Microsoft Excel XP in order to define the relationships 
between selected parameters.

where V is the volume (ml) of 10 mM NaOH required to neu-
tralize the free fatty acids produced.
Lipase activity was also measured using 4-MUO as sub-
strate according to our previous work [12]. The amount of 
4-methylumbelliferone released by lipase was measured 
with a microplate reader (Synergy™2, BioTek Instruments 
Inc.) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and at an emis-
sion wavelength of 460 nm. The inhibition (%) was calcu-
lated by using the following formula:

where Fcontrol and Fcontrol blank are fluorescence values of

with and without 4-MUO, respectively.
The concentration which inhibits pancreatic lipase activ-
ity by 50 % (IC50) was determined on the basis of the graph 
Results
Effect of chokeberry juices on pancreatic lipase activity
The effect of five commercial black chokeberry juices on 
the porcine pancreatic lipase activity was assessed in vitro 
using a pH–stat method with three different lipid substrates: 
triolein (glycerol trioleate), sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil. 
Independently, lipase activity was determined by fluorimetric 
method with 4-MUO as substrate. The results, expressed 
as IC50 values, are given in Table 1. The IC50 values varied 
from 0.59 to 5.84 μl of juice/ml of reaction mixture in the 
fluorimetric method and from 27.79 to 221.66 μl of juice/
ml in the pH–stat method. Two juices (brands 4 and 5) at the 
highest doses (307.7 μl of juice/ml of reaction mixture) in 
509Eur Food Res Technol (2016) 242:505–515

the conditions of the assay did not inhibit pancreatic lipase in 
triolein emulsion. In the case of both oil emulsion systems, 
three juices at the highest concentration (285.7 μl of juice/ml 
of reaction mixture) did not affect enzyme activity.
Antioxidant capacity of chokeberry juices
In the present work, three methods (ABTS, DPPH, and 
FRAP) were selected for the evaluation of the antioxidant 
capacity of the chokeberry juices tested because the determi-
nation of antioxidant capacity of complex food matrix is still 
an unresolved problem. The Trolox equivalents (TE) values 
were calculated in order to compare the chokeberry juices, 
as shown in Fig. 1. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the 
antioxidant capacity were found for the analyzed juices. The 
TE values varied in the ranges 20.39–91.21 mmol/l of juice, 
19.02–106.13 mmol/l, and 12.19–61.09 mmol/l as deter-
mined by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP method, respectively. 
The ranking order of the antioxidant capacities was the same 
for ABTS and FRAP methods, while juice of brand 3 was 
more active than juice brand 1 in DPPH method.
Phenolic compounds of chokeberry juices
The black chokeberry juices were analyzed for the content 
of total phenolics, total anthocyanins, and total proantho-
cyanidins using a Folin–Ciocalteu, a pH-differential, and 
acid depolymerization methods, respectively. As it is shown 
in Table 2, significant differences have been observed for 
the commercial juices tested (p < 0.05), which were about 
fourfold for total phenolics (2.73–10.35 g GAE/l) and 
about sevenfold in the case of total anthocyanins (0.10–
0.67 g CGE/l) and total proanthocyanidins (0.64–4.17 g 
CYE/l). Proanthocyanidins accounted for 29.8–40.3 %, 
while anthocyanins contributed only for 3.6–6.7 % of total 
phenolic content. The mean size of proanthocyanidin mol-
ecules described by their mDP was very diverse for the 
juices tested and ranged from 12 to 52.
Additionally, the juices with the highest anti-lipase and 
antioxidant activities (three brands) were analyzed for 
the phenolic profiles by UPLC–MS and for the content of 
individual phenolic compounds using HPLC system. Rep-
resentative HPLC chromatograms of chokeberry juice are 
presented in Fig. 2. The results of qualitative and quanti-
tative phenolic composition in black chokeberry juices 
are summarized in Table 3. The results showed that chlo-
rogenic acids dominated in the group of low molecular

phenolic compounds and they represented 67.7–82.4 % of 
phenolics. Flavonols in chokeberry juices were mainly a 
mixture of quercetin glycosides and constituted only 4.5–
18.8 % of phenolics. The contribution of anthocyanins in 
total phenolics varied from 4.4 % in juice brand 3 to 9.6 % 
in juice brand 1. Cyanidin 3-O-galactoside and cyanidin 
3-O-arabinoside were the main anthocyanins in the tested 
chokeberry juices.
Basic parameters of the juices studied
The basic chemical composition of five commercial choke-
berry juices is given in Table 4. Statistically significant dif-
ferences (p < 0.05) in all quality parameters tested were 
found in chokeberry juices produced by different compa-
nies. The minimum and maximum pH values were meas-
ured as 3.42 and 3.72, and the total soluble solids (°Brix) 
values ranged from 12.5 to 20.1. Total content of fructose, 
glucose, sucrose, and sorbitol varied significantly from 
89.5 to 162.4 g/l of juice. Sorbitol dominated in all juices 
and amounted to 39.5–47.6 % of total sugars. Sucrose was 
noted only in two juices at 1.7 and 3.0 g/l. The total organic 
acids content in the juices tested varied from 12.3 g/l 
to 21.9 g/l with significant differences dependently on 
the brands (p < 0.05). The amounts of organic acids ana-
lyzed were ordered as malic acid > tartaric acid > citric 
acid > oxalic acid. Malic acid amounted to 52.6–60.9 % of 
total organic acids content.
Discussion
Obesity is one of the most rapidly expanding metabolic 
disorders, and therefore, its prophylaxis is a big challenge 
for the world. Reduced absorption of dietary fat from the 
intestine by the inhibition of digestive lipases, especially 
pancreatic lipase, is an approach to decreasing the risk of 
obesity [15]. The presence of pancreatic lipase inhibitors 
has recently been reported in some edible fruits, includ-
ing black chokeberry [12, 13, 21, 25–29]. Inhibition of this 
enzyme by fruits is attributed to the phenolic compounds, 
such as proanthocyanidins [12, 21, 27], ellagitannins [25, 
26], anthocyanins [13, 28], and flavones [29]. The pre-
sent study reports that proanthocyanidins accounted for 
29.8–40.3 %, while anthocyanins contributed only for 
3.6–6.7 % of total phenolic content (2.73–10.35 g/l) in the

black chokeberry juices commercially available in Poland 
(Table 2). The total phenolic content estimated by HPLC 
method ranged from 1.00 to 1.45 g/l and was six- or sev-
enfold lower than total phenolic content determined by 
Folin–Ciocalteu method (Tables 2, 3). It may confirm the 
significant contribution of polymeric proanthocyanidins in 
the phenolic compounds present in chokeberry juices. On 
the other hand, the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent is nonspecific 
to phenolic compounds and can react with a wide range of 
thiol derivatives, some vitamins and aromatic amino acids 
[30]. According to the literature data, proanthocyanidins 
are the dominant phenolic components of black choke-
berry fruit and chokeberry juices [2, 3]. Additionally, Wu 
et al. [4] found that chokeberry fruits contained only pro-
cyanidins and polymers with DP > 10 accounted for nearly 
82 % of total procyanidins content. Furthermore, the lev-
els of total phenolics (2.73–10.35 g/l) and total anthocya-
nins (0.10–0.67 g/l) estimated in this study agree with the 
literature data. Total phenolic content determined by the 
Folin–Ciocalteu method varied from 5.46 [31] to 18.54 g/l 
[32], while total anthocyanin content estimated by pH-dif-
ferential method ranged from 0.15 [11] to 3.04 g/l [6]. The 
large differentiation noticed in both the present and previ-
ous studies may be due to differences in chokeberry culti-
vars, maturation stages as well as technology of juice pro-
duction, and time of the juice storage. Among chokeberry 
phenolic constituents, in particular, anthocyanins were 
extensively degraded (losses 93 %) during juice processing, 
while levels of hydroxycinnamic acids decreased by 37 %, 
proanthocyanins by 45 %, and flavonols by 48 % [33]. On 
the other hand, Mayer-Miebach et al. [34] demonstrated 
high stability of phenolic compounds during chokeberries 
processing without enzyme treatment of mash.
The results of the present study revealed that all the 
chokeberry juices tested decreased pancreatic lipase activ-
ity in 4-MUO assay, while the inhibitory effect in lipid 
emulsions showed practically only two of them (Table 1). 
From a nutritional point of view, the use of different lipid 
emulsions as substrates for pancreatic lipase better resem-
bles physiological conditions because dietary long-chain 
triglycerides are broken down into oil-in-water emulsions 
in mouth, stomach, and small intestine during digestion 
process [35]. The chokeberry juice brand 1 exhibited the 
lowest IC50 values and, therefore, the greatest inhibitory 
effect on pancreatic lipase (Table 1). This juice had the 
highest concentration of total phenolics and total proantho-
cyanidins (Table 2) as well as phenolic acids and anthocya-
nins determined by HPLC method (Table 3). The anti-lipase 
activity measured by fluorimetric method was correlated 
with the total phenolics (r = −0.855), total anthocyanins 
(r = −0.788), total proanthocyanidins (r = −0.857), and 
the mDP of proanthocyanidins (r = −0.830). For compari-
son, a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the IC50 
value in triolein emulsion and total phenolics was 0.149, 
total anthocyanins 0.460, and total proanthocyanidins 
0.063. Gironés-Vilaplana et al. [28] observed strong corre-
lation between the lipase inhibition and anthocyanin con-
tent for Latin-American fruits. On the other hand, Boath 
et al. [25] suggested that anthocyanins are not necessary for 
lipase inhibition by berry polyphenols.
The lipase inhibition determined in triolein emulsion 
was correlated only with the mDP of proanthocyanidins

(r = −0.999). The mean size of proanthocyanidin mol-
ecules described by their mDP in the chokeberry juices 
tested was very diverse and ranged from 12 to 52, while 
for two more efficient juices was >40 (Table 2). For com-
parison, the mDP value for chokeberry juice obtained from 
heated fruits followed by decantation of raw juice was 24 
[34]. The very high mDP values obtained in this study for 
juice brands 1 and 2 may indicate lack of enzyme treat-
ment of chokeberry mash during fruit processing as well as 
decantation or filtration process of raw juice. The mDP of 
proanthocyanidins occurring in chokeberry fruit was deter-
mined as 59 [36] or in the acetone fruit extract as 19 [34]. 
The published studies have shown that anti-lipase activity 
of proanthocyanidins depends upon the degree of polymeri-
zation and more potent effect was observed for higher DP 
[27, 37]. For example, the IC50 values determined with the 
use of 4-MUO as the substrate were as follows: for dimer 
>125 μg/ml, but 32.9 and only 0.9 μg/ml for trimer and 
procyanidins over nonamer, respectively [27]. Proanthocya-
nidins have been also postulated as the major factor respon-
sible for the anti-lipase effect of apple, cocoa, and Salacia 
reticulata [27, 38, 39]. The role of proanthocyanidins in 
reducing obesity was recently reviewed by Salvadó et al. 
[40]. In vivo studies with different animal models confirm 
anti-obesity action of proanthocyanidins from various plant 
sources. Additionally, they also reduce the mass of adipose 
tissues and decrease body weight gain.
Nevertheless, chokeberry juice contains several classes 
of phenolic compounds which in combination might dif-
ferently affect the lipase activity due to the different inter-
action between them as well as with other juice compo-
nents. The results of qualitative and quantitative analyses 
of low molecular phenolic compounds by UPLC-MS and 
HPLC methods allowed to conclude that all most active 
juices had the same phenolic profile (Table 3), which was 
in accordance with the data published [9, 34]. The major 
low molecular phenolic compounds of chokeberry juice 
were chlorogenic acids such as 3- and 5-O-caffeoylquinic 
acid. The results published by Worsztynowicz et al. [13] 
used p-nitrophenol palmitate as substrate demonstrated that 
chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins, except for cyanidin 
3-glucoside, isolated from chokeberry fruit did not inhibit 
the pancreatic lipase. Unfortunately, authors of the above 
paper have not determined proanthocyanidins content in 
the extracts tested. In the assay using 4-MUO as substrate, 
the IC50 value for chlorogenic acid (the second low molec-
ular phenolic in juices tested) was higher than that one for 
dimer but lower than the IC50 values for higher oligomers 
[27]. The differences in anti-lipase activity of chokeberry 
juices tested may be also due to nonphenolic components 
that may affect a surface property of the substrate emul-
sion and absorption of lipase at an oil–water interface. The 
juices tested in our studies differed also in terms of the 
basic chemical composition (Table 4). Total soluble solid, 
organic acid, sugars, and sorbitol contents were consistent 
with other report [1]. The low levels of sucrose in the juices 
studied are evidence that they were made purely from fruits 
without addition of sucrose. Additionally, the juice brand 1 
with the highest anti-lipase activity had the highest soluble 
solids, glucose, sorbitol, and organic acids content.
Our results have also shown that commercially available 
black chokeberry juices may improve antioxidant status. It 
is a desired effect in the case of obesity which is consid-
ered as a state of chronic oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion related to reduced antioxidant defense and high reac-
tive oxygen species production [41]. Antioxidant capacity 
was affected by the type of assay system and phenolic 
compounds contents. Additionally, the antioxidant capac-
ity ranking order of the juices tested was slightly differ-
ent than that one regarding the anti-lipase activity of the 
juices. The juice brand 3 with no anti-lipase activity in oils 
emulsions was the second in the order in terms of scav-
enging free radicals and ferric reducing power (Fig. 1). 
The antioxidant capacity as TE values was strongly cor-
related with total phenolics, anthocyanins, and proantho-
cyanidins (r > 0.934). We also observed a high correlation 
between antioxidant capacity and inhibition of pancreatic 
lipase measured by 4-MUO assay with a Pearson’s correla-
tion coefficient of r > −0.740. On the other hand, we have 
noticed lack of correlation between lipase inhibitory activ-
ity in triolein emulsion and antioxidant capacity. Accord-
ing to Zheng and Wang [42], among polyphenols present 
in chokeberry juice anthocyanins contribute the most to the 
total antioxidant activity (42 %). Besides the anthocyanins, 
proanthocyanidins present in very high amounts in choke-
berry juice are also very potent scavengers of free radi-
cals as well as the inhibitors of lipid peroxidation [43, 44]. 
Moreover, black chokeberry juice phenolics were efficient 
in regenerating or protecting α-tocopherol against oxida-
tion [32].
Conclusions
In summary, the present study provides the first evidence 
that black chokeberry juices exhibited pancreatic lipase 
inhibition in vitro, which depends on the test method used. 
Additionally, our results suggested that the proanthocyani-
dins degree of polymerization was a very important factor 
responsible for the high inhibitory activity against pancre-
atic lipase. Therefore, proanthocyanidins-rich chokeberry 
juices as potent inhibitors of pancreatic lipase should be a 
component of a diet addressed to obese people as a natural 
alternative for obesity prophylaxis and treatment. This was 
the first study on inhibitory activity of chokeberry juice 
against pancreatic lipase. Moreover, consumption of black

chokeberry juice may be a convenient and efficient way 
to supplement our diet with natural antioxidants capable 
of scavenging free radicals. Further studies are needed to 
examine the exact mechanism of the pancreatic lipase inhi-
bition as well as influence of the chokeberry juice compo-
nents on other digestive enzymes involved in degradation 
of carbohydrates and proteins.
