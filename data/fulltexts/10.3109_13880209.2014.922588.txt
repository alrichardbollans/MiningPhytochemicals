Abstract
Context: Fitzroya cupressoides (Molina) I. M. Johnst. and Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic.Serm.
& Bizzarri are two Chilean Cupressaceae that are naturally resistant to biodegradation.
Secondary metabolites from these species display a variety of biological activities.
Objective: To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of two lignans, a diterpene and a flavonol
isolated from A. chilensis and F. cupressoides, to elucidate their cytological effects on P3X murine
myeloma cells.
Materials and methods: The antiproliferative activity of yatein, isotaxiresinol, ferruginol, and
isorhamnetin was evaluated in vitro using the MTT assay. The effect of yatein at the cellular
level, due to its high antiproliferative activity was evaluated. P3X cells treated for 24 h with 12.5
and 25 mg/mL of yatein were also examined at the cytological level using immunofluorescence
and scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
Results: Yatein, a lignan isolated from A. chilensis, potentially inhibited P3X murine myeloma cell
proliferation, resulting in approximately 75% cell death in response to a 25mg/mL treatment
with the lignan. P3X cells lost membrane integrity at the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels,
including organelles, in response to yatein treatment (12.5 mg/mL), and we observed changes in
the cytoplasmic organization and distribution of microtubules. The other compounds tested
had low activity.
Discussion and conclusions: Yatein is a lignan precursor of podophyllotoxin, a key agent in
anticancer drugs. Due to its structural similarities to podophyllotoxin, yatein could have similar
cytoplasmic target(s), such as the microtubular apparatus. These findings suggest that yatein
may be of potential pharmacological interest and warrants further investigation in human
cell lines.

Introduction
Austrocedrus chilensis (D.Don) Pic.Serm. & Bizzarri and
Fitzroya cupressoides (Molina) I. M. Johnst are species
belonging to the Cupressaceae, and are endemic to the southern
portion of South America, naturally being found only in Chile
and Argentina. The wood from these plants is renowned for its
durability and resistance to biological degradation (Donoso,
1993; Rodrı´guez, 2003). There is evidence that the quality of
the wood results from the presence of a particular class of
secondary metabolite (Donoso et al., 2008).
Throughout history, secondary metabolites have provided
a rich source of molecules that have biological properties,
particularly as anticancer agents with different chemical
structures and varied bioactivity (Liu et al., 2009). To date,
some of the most important studied metabolites are
podophyllotoxin and its hemisynthetic derivatives (etoposide,
teniposide, and etoposide phosphate), which are particularly
interesting due to their ability to inhibit tumor cell prolifer-
ation, making them useful in chemotherapy for the treatment
of lung cancer (Ayres & Loik, 1990; Gordaliza et al., 2006;
Yang et al., 2007).
Previous studies in our laboratory on the secondary
metabolites present in extracts of Austrocedrus chilensis and
Fitzroya cupressoides led to the isolation and chemical
characterization of diterpenes and lignans, their major

constituents (Bittner et al., 1997; Donoso et al., 2008;
Flores et al., 2001). It is well established that lignans and
diterpenes play a role in the defense mechanisms of plants
and that they are biologically active, showing antibiotic,
antifungal, antiviral, immune stabilizing, antiasthmatic, anti-
oxidant, antineoplastic, gastroprotective, and cytotoxic prop-
erties (Adlercreutz, 1995; Ayres & Loik, 1990; Banskota
et al., 2003; Charlton, 1998; Chen & Thompson, 2003; Chen
et al., 2011; Donoso et al., 2008; Donoso-Fierro et al., 2009;
Raffaelli et al., 2002; Theoduloz et al., 2011). Therefore,
studies that examine their biological characteristics are very
important, because they may be useful for pharmaceutical
applications.
The present study evaluated the antiproliferative activity
of two lignans, a diterpene and a flavonol isolated from
A. chilensis and F. cupressoides, to elucidate their cytological
effects on P3X murine myeloma cells in vitro using
immunofluorescence techniques and scanning and transmis-
sion electron microscopy.
Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
All solvents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); Dulbecco’s modification of
Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum
(FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine were
purchased from Lonza Verviers SPRL (Verviers, Belgium).
The anti-a-tubulin antibody was purchased from GE
Healthcare (Buckingamshire, UK), and fluorescein
isothiocyanate conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody and ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 40,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) were
obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).
Plant material
Austrocedrus chilensis (247 m.a.s.l. 41550S–71520W) and
Fitzroya cupressoides (314 m.a.s.l. 41570S–71520W) were
collected in February 2009, by Dr. Donoso-Fierro in the
Patagonia North X Region, Province of Llanquihue,
Cochamo´, Llanada Grande, Chile. Dr. Roberto Rodrı´guez,
a specialist from the Department of Botany at the Universidad
de Concepcio´n, identified the plant samples, which were then
deposited in the Herbarium of the Universidad de Concepcio´n
(CONC.) under the following collection numbers: CONC
169166 (Austrocedrus chilensis) and CONC 169169 (Fitzroya
cupressoides).
Extraction and identification
The extraction procedure followed that reported by Donoso
et al. (2008). Briefly, 800 g of heartwood samples from
F. cupressoides and A. chilensis was manually separated and
subsequently chipped and extracted three-times with n-hexane
to remove fats. Then, the heartwood of F. cupressoides and
A. chilensis was extracted with methanol and methanol/H2O
(80:20), respectively. Heartwood extracts were suspended in
distilled H2O, and then extracted three times with the same
volumes of ethyl acetate. The extracts from each species were
filtrates, and they were concentrated under a vacuum at 40 C.
Austrocedrus chilensis and F. cupressoides extracts (30 g)
were subjected to column chromatography using silica gel 60.
Extensive gradient elution was then employed using n-hexane,
n-hexane-ethyl acetate, and ethyl acetate-methanol. The
purity of each fraction was determined by thin layer
chromatography using silica gel 60 F254 (TLC) and fractions
with the same TLC profile pattern were pooled and further
purified by rechromatography to yield pure compounds.
The structural identification of the yatein and isotaxir-
esinol (lignans), ferruginol (diterpene), and isorhamnetin
(O-methylated flavonol), was performed using spectroscopic
methods, including UV, GC-MS, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR
and the structures were compared with previously reported
data (Cao et al., 2009; Hendrawati et al., 2011; King et al.,
1952; Ulubelen et al., 1994). Specifically, to analyze the pure
compounds, 2–3 mg of each purified fraction was dissolved in
500 mL of deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and transferred
to an NMR tube. The samples were analyzed and recorded
using a Varian 400 NMR spectrometer operating at 250 MHz
for 1H and 13C nuclei. The chemical shift in  (ppm) was
assigned with a reference to the signal from the residual
protons in the deuterated solvent and TMS was used as an
internal standard. The mass spectra were determined using a
5972 series Hewlett Packard mass spectrometer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GC/MS analyses (MS
detection at 70 eV) were performed under the following
conditions: column, HP-5, 30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 mm; tem-
perature, 100 C isothermal for 5 min, with 10 increments per
minute up to 275 C (held constant for 20 min); split injection,
100:1; injector temperature, 275 C; detector temperature,
300 C; and carrier gas, helium.
Murine myeloma cell culture
The murine myeloma P3X63-Ag8.653 cell line, which is
derived from Balb/c mice, is a well-known cell model that is
widely used by labs worldwide to produce monoclonal
antibodies and for assays and biological studies. Due to
their relative ease of handling and culturing, these cells
currently serve as a cell model for preliminary work in our
lab. This myeloma cell line was propagated and maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/strepto-
mycin, and glutamine (2 mM) in a humidified incubator
with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% humidity at 37
C.
For each treatment, 100 000 cells/well were seeded into a
24-well culture plate containing 1 mL of complete DMEM per
well and cells were incubated for 20 h in the absence (control)
or presence of the compounds.
Pure compounds were added to obtain final concentra-
tions of 12.5 and 25 mg/mL. Data were calculated as a
percentage of control, and all experiments were performed in
replicates of 24.
Cell proliferation assay (MTT test)
The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-
lium bromide] system is commonly used to assess the activity
of living cells through mitochondrial dehydrogenases
(Mosmann, 1983). After 24 h of treatment with the com-
pounds, 100 mL from each of the 24 wells was transferred to
96 well/plates. About 10 mL of MTT solution was added to

each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 C. The
blue MTT-formazan product was solubilized by the addition
of 100mL DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm
using a NOVOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies,
Offenburg, Germany). Antiproliferative activity was
expressed as the percentage of viable cells relative to
untreated cells (control). The results for each experimental
condition represent the mean of 24 replicate wells.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Among the compounds tested, yatein was selected for
evaluation of its effect at the cellular level, due to its high
antiproliferative activity. The microtubular component of the
murine myeloma cell cytoskeleton was investigated as a
possible target of yatein. Untreated P3X cells (control) and
P3X cells treated for 24 h with 12.5 and 25 mg/mL yatein were
seeded in 75 mL flasks (approximately 3 000 000 cells/flask
in 30 mL of DMEM). Samples were collected by centrifuga-
tion at 1000 rpm, supernatants were discarded, and the pellets
were re-suspended in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), pH 7.4.
Cell suspensions were placed on poly-L-lysine coated
coverslips and incubated at room temperature for 60 min.
Excess cell suspension was aspirated and the coverslips
were rinsed briefly with PBS. Cell-coated coverslips were
immersed in ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1), incubated at
20 C for 10 min and air-dried.
After two washes in PBS, each coverslip was placed on a
drop of blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS)
for 30 min at 37 C to block non-specific binding sites,
followed by two washes with PBS. To remove the blocking
buffer, each coverslip was held on its edge using forceps, and
the blocking buffer was drained onto a sheet of paper. Then,
samples were incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody
against a-tubulin (diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at
room temperature, using a 60 mL drop of antibody solution for
each coverslip. After rinsing three-times in PBS, coverslips
were dried and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate
conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:100
in blocking buffer). To rule out non-specific staining, control
samples were prepared without the primary antibody. After
three washes in PBS, nuclei were stained by mounting
coverslips on the slides using a drop of ProLong Gold
antifade reagent containing DAPI. The images were captured
using a computer-assisted image analysis system that includes
an Axiophot Microscope equipped with a color video camera
(AxioCam MRC, Watertown, MA) and the AxioVision
software package (Zeiss, Watertown, MA).
Scanning and transmission electron microscopy
P3X control cells and P3X cells treated for 24 h with 12.5 and
25 mg/mL yatein were processed for electron microscopy.
Approximately 3 000 000 P3X cells were seeded in 30 mL
of DMEM in 75 mL flasks. Cells were collected in tubes and
centrifuged. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% glutaraldehyde
(pH 7.2) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 C
(Karnovsky, 1965). After rinsing overnight in the same
buffer, samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in
cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 C. After two washings in
the same buffer, samples were dehydrated in a series of
graded ethanol.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cells were dried
according to the critical point method, using CO2 in a Balzers
Union CPD 020, sputter-coated with gold in a Balzers MED
010 unit, and observed with a JEOL JSM 5 200 electron
microscope (JOEL Inc, Peabody, MA).
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), samples
were fixed and dehydrated as described above and embedded
in an Epon mixture resin. Thin sections (50–70 nm) were cut
with Reichert Ultracut and LKB Nova ultramicrotomes using
a diamond knife, collected on copper grids, stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed on a JEOL 1200
EX II electron microscope.
Statistical analysis
Significant differences between the control group and each
experimental group were determined using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). Differences were considered signifi-
cant at the 5% probability level.
Results
Antiproliferative activity
MTT assays were used to test the cytotoxic effects of yatein,
isotaxiresinol, ferruginol, and isorhamnetin on P3X cells.
Yatein exhibited potent cytotoxicity, inducing 75% cell death
at 25 mg/mL after 24 h of treatment (Figure 1). Furthermore,
yatein was toxic toward P3X cells in a dose-dependent
manner. In contrast, isotaxiresinol, isorhamnetin, and ferru-
ginol did not significantly affect P3X cell proliferation
(ANOVA: p50.001, Figure 1).

Immunofluorescence
To evaluate the effect of yatein at the cytological level, we
performed immunofluorescence staining using a monoclonal
antibody against a-tubulin. In control cells (untreated cells,
Figure 2A), microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs, arrows)
were visible as bright spots within the cytoplasm, whereas
microtubules were widely distributed in the cytoplasm. DAPI
staining demonstrated that the nucleus was localized in a
defined zone in the cytoplasm (Figure 2B). P3X murine
myeloma cells treated with low concentrations (12.5mg/mL)
of yatein were affected at the microtubular level, as
demonstrated by the disappearance of MTOCs and changes
in the organization and distribution of microtubules
(Figure 2C). In addition, diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence
was observed, likely due to the presence of unpolymerized
tubulin. DAPI staining revealed a reduction in the volume of
the nucleus in yatein-treated cells (Figure 2D) compared with
control cells.
In P3X cells treated with higher concentrations of yatein
(25mg/mL), we observed brilliant cytoplasmic areas,
indicating the formation of large tubulin aggregates
(Figure 2E). DAPI staining revealed an apparent reduction
in the volume of the nucleus compared with control cells
(Figure 2F).
SEM and TEM
SEM imaging revealed that control cells (untreated cells) had
a regular round shape with numerous filamentous extensions
on the cell surface (Figure 3A). Cells treated with 12.5 mg/mL
yatein increased in size and transitioned to an ‘‘egg-like’’
shape (Figure 3B). Additionally, we observed a consistent loss
of filamentous extensions on the cell surface (Figure 3C) and
the formation of holes in the cell membrane (Figure 3D,
stars).
TEM imaging revealed that control murine myeloma cells
were round, with a heterochromatic nucleus (Figure 4A).
Mitochondria (Figure 4B) and the Golgi apparatus
(Figure 4C) displayed a defined and ordered ultrastructure;
viruses were also visible in the cytoplasm as they are residents
of this cell line (Figure 4A, rectangles). In contrast, cells

treated with 12.5 mg/mL yatein displayed a highly condensed
nucleus (Figure 4D) and a completely disorganized membrane
system in the cytoplasm (Figure 4E); in some cells, the mem-
brane system was highly compromised (Figure 4F and G).
In addition, treated cells displayed nuclear fragmentation and
mitochondria with damaged cristae (Figure 4H). We also
observed cellular membrane interruptions (Figure 4I, arrow-
heads) and the extrusion of cytoplasmic materials from the
cell (Figure 4L, arrows). Extruded materials located in
proximity to cavities (Figure 4M, star) were also noted in
SEM observations (Figure 3D).
As demonstrated by SEM investigations, treatment with
25 mg/mL did not substantially generate additional morpho-
logical alterations (data not shown). The membrane system
was dramatically altered (Figure 5B) by 12.5 mg/mL, as
demonstrated by SEM and TEM. Cellular inclusions were
subsequently extruded (Figure 5C, arrowheads), and multi-
lamellar bodies were present in the cytoplasm (Figure 5D,
arrows).
Discussion
The wood extracts of Chilean Cupressaceae are composed
of fatty acids, mono and sesquiterpenes, diterpenes,
lignans, and phytosterols. The most active compounds
are phenolic diterpenes and lignans, and among them
matairesinol, podophyllotoxin, yatein, ferruginol, and 6,7-
dehydroferruginol (Banskota et al., 2003; Donoso et al.,
2008, Donoso-Fierro et al., 2009). Lignans represent one
of the most important and interesting classes of biologic-
ally active compounds, because lignan molecules can
induce cancer cell apoptosis (Ayella et al., 2010; Chavez
et al., 2011; Huong et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2007; Xu
et al., 2006, 2011). Podophyllotoxin inhibits microtubule
assembly of the mitotic apparatus, acting as a competitive
inhibitor of the binding site for colchicine to tubulin
(Loike et al., 1978); this process occurs during mitosis,
where the microtubules are rearranged to form the mitotic
spindle, which is essential for cell division (Ayres & Loik,
1990; Islam & Iskander, 2004; Schmidt & Bastians, 2007).
Among the compounds tested here, only yatein was active
against P3X murine myeloma cells, inhibiting proliferation
and killing 75% of cells. The molecular structure of yatein, a
lignan previously isolated from A. chilensis heartwood
(Donoso et al., 2008), is characterized by a podophyllotoxin
ring system, which includes a four member fused ring system
containing a lactone ring and a pendent aromatic ring
(Figure 6). Studies on the structure–activity relationship
(SAR) revealed that the antiproliferative activity of com-
pounds with a podophyllotoxin ring system depends on
the presence of rings A and E. Specifically, studies on the
structural modification of podophyllotoxin analogues, such
as VP-16 (40-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-4-(4,6-O-ethy-
lidene-b-D-glucopyranoside), revealed that removal of the A
ring reduced their activity by one-third. The E ring is
responsible for activity due to its ability to rotate freely
(Long & Casazza, 1994).
In contrast, recent studies indicate that yatein is toxic
toward DLD-1, CCRF-CEM, and HL-60 cell lines (Chen
et al., 2011) and significantly suppresses herpes simplex virus
type 1 replication in HeLa cells (Kuo et al., 2006). Here, we
show that yatein affects P3X cells in a dose-dependent
manner, and we investigated the possible cytoplasmic targets
of yatein.
P3X cells that survived yatein treatment clearly displayed
an altered microtubular apparatus, with the disappearance of
filamentous structures and diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence,
which is an indicative of tubulin depolymerization. There is

cells treated with 12.5mg/mL yatein.
(A) Control cells showed a regular round
shape with characteristic filamentous exten-
sions on the surface. (B–D) Treated cells
revealed alterations in their shape (B), loss of

the surface (D, stars). Bars: 1 mm.
382 C. Donoso-Fierro et al. Pharm Biol, 2015; 53(3): 378–385
no evidence to establish whether yatein can bind microtubules
and directly affect the tubulin depolymerization process.
However, considering the similarity in the molecular structure
between yatein and podophyllotoxin, our data suggest a direct
(not unique) effect of yatein on microtubules.
SEM and TEM were used to investigate of the effects
of yatein at the ultrastructural level. In response to yatein,
we observed the loss of filamentous structures and a change in
the size and shape of P3X cells. Inside the cell, we observed
deep alterations to the membrane system, with the extrusion
of cytoplasmic materials and condensation and fragmentation
of the nucleus. Taken together, these results confirm the
effect of yatein on different cellular targets and biochemical
and physiological cell parameters. Further studies focused on

Control cells were characterized by a round
shape, a heterochromatic nucleus, and a
mitochondria and Golgi apparatus with a
normal ultrastructure; viruses were also
visible in the cytoplasm, as they are resident
to this cell line (rectangles). (D–M) TEM
micrographs evidenced morphological alter-
ations in cells treated with 12.5 mg/mL yatein,
including condensation of the nucleus

promised in some cells (F and G). Nuclear
fragmentation and mitochondria with
damaged cristae were also observed (H).

and the extrusion of cytoplasmic materials

the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the effect of yatein on P3X cells are warranted.
In addition, similar research in other mammalian cell
models is being carried out in our laboratory to elucidate the
mechanism of action of this interesting lignan molecule.
Conclusions
We tested several purified compounds from Patagonia
Cupressaceae plants and yatein consistently inhibited P3X
murine myeloma cell proliferation. Other compounds from
the same plants did not show similar biological properties. In
cells that survived to yatein treatment, the microtubular
apparatus was altered, as determined by immunofluorescence
techniques, and SEM and TEM analyses displayed changes at
the morphological and ultrastructural level. Yatein treatment
altered cell shape and damaged the membrane system.
To elucidate its mechanism of cytotoxic action on P3X and
other cell lines, the biological activity of yatein and its
chemically modified analogs warrants further study.
