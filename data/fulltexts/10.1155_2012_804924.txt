The fruit of Cornus oﬃcinalis Sieb. et Zucc. is commonly prescribed in Asian countries as a tonic formula. In this study,
the hepatoprotective eﬀect of ethanolic extracts of the fruit of C. oﬃcinalis (ECO) was investigated in a mouse model of
acetaminophen- (APAP-) induced liver injury. Pretreatment of mice with ECO (100, 250, and 500mg/kg for 7 days) signiﬁcantly
prevented the APAP (200mg/kg) induced hepatic damage as indicated by the serum marker enzymes (AST, ALT, and LDH).
Parallel to these changes, ECO treatment also prevented APAP-induced oxidative stress in the mice liver by inhibiting lipid
peroxidation (MDA) and restoring the levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and HO-1) and glutathione. Liver injury and
collagen accumulation were assessed using histological studies by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Our results indicate that ECO
can prevent hepatic injuries associated with APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by preventing or alleviating oxidative stress.
1.Introduction
The fruit of Cornus oﬃcinalis Sieb. et Zucc. (Corni Fructus)
is commonly prescribed in traditional medicine as a tonic
f o r m u l aa sw e l la sat r e a t m e n tf o raw i d er a n g eo fm e d i c a l
conditions [1]. The components of this plant include iridoid
total glycosides (such as morroniside and loganin) and a
numberofpolyphenols,includingcornusiinA,B,andC,and
monomeric and trimeric hydrolysable tannins [2, 3]. Mor-
roniside and loganin extracted from C. oﬃcinalis has been
proposed to prevent oxidative stress [4]. C. oﬃcinalis, or its
constituents, is thought to enhance liver and kidney function
and has been reported to exhibit antihypertriglyceridemic
activity [5], and antioxidation eﬀects [4, 6].
Acetaminophen (APAP) is widely prescribed as an anal-
gesic and antipyretic drug in the clinic and is sold in numer-
ous over-the-counter preparations as a single compound or
in combination with other medications [7, 8]. At normal
doses, APAP is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) to
form the highly reactive species, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone
imine (NAPQI), which under normal conditions is readily
detoxiﬁed by conjugation with glutathione (GSH). However,
in humans and mice, high doses of APAP saturate detoxiﬁca-
tion pathways, leading to hepatic glutathione depletion and
excessiveproductionofNAPQI,whichfreelybindstocellular
molecules [9].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causally related to
oxidative stress. Many studies have demonstrated that over-
production of ROS can further aggravate oxidative stress and
have implicated ROS in a number disease processes, includ-
ingheartdisease,diabetes,liverinjury,cancer,andaging[10–
14]. Maintaining the balance between ROS and antioxidant
enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
(CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), is, therefore,2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
crucialandcouldbeanimportantmechanismforpreventing
damage by oxidative stress. This balance has been suggested
to have an important role in preventing APAP toxicity [15].
In recent years, an increasing attention has been focused
on an “emerging molecule”: heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
the rate limiting enzyme in the breakdown of heme into
carbon monoxide, iron and bilirubin [16]. Ho-1 has been
shown to be induced during oxidative injury, and its
induction acts as an important cellular defense mechanism
against such injuries [17]. It is noteworthy that induction
of HO-1 expression contributes to protection against liver
damage induced by several chemical compounds such as
acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride and heavy metals,
suggesting HO-1 induction as a prominent cellular endeavor
for hepatoprotection [18]. However, the physiological eﬀects
of C. oﬃcinalis in the context of chemically induced liver
injury and possible involvement of HO-1 have not been
determined.
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the protective eﬀects of
C. oﬃcinalis on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice with
emphasis on HO-1 induction, which may help to determine
an optimal condition for further research.
2.MaterialsandMethods
2.1. Plant Material. The fruit of C. oﬃcinalis was purchased
from Icheon, Korea, authenticated by Prof. Young Bae Seo
(Daejeon Univ) and stored as a voucher specimen in the
Herbarium of herbal medicine EBM research center, South
Korea, with the issue no., KIOM2008CF002.
2.2. Chemicals and Reagents. Morroniside and loganin were
purchased from NPC BioTechnology (Yeongi, Korea) and
Wako (Osaka, Japan), respectively. The purity of each
compound was determined to be above 98% by HPLC
analysis. HPLC-grade reagents, methanol, acetonitrile, and
water were obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA).
Other chemicals were of analytical grade.
2.3. Sample Preparation. C. oﬃcinalis was cut into small
pieces and extracted twice with 70% ethanol at room
temperature. The solution was ﬁltered through ﬁlter paper
and evaporated in vacuo t oy i e l dap o w e r e de x t r a c t( y i e l d=
44.0%). The lyophilized powders of ethanolic extracts of C.
oﬃcinalis (ECO) were dissolved in distilled water before oral
administration to experimental animals.
For HPLC analysis, the plant material was powdered and
sieved through a 600µm sieve (no. 30) prior to analysis.
The sample powder was weighed (1.0g) into a 100mL ﬂask
and 100% methanol was added to the volumetric mark.
The mixture was sonicated for 60min at room temperature.
After extraction, the mixture was ﬁltered through a 0.2µm
membrane ﬁlter. The resulting solution was used HPLC
analysis.
2.4. Chromatographic System. Analysis was performed using
a Shimadzu LC-20A HPLC system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto,
Japan), consisting of a solvent delivery unit, an online
degasser, a column oven, an autosampler, and a PDA detec-
tor. The data processor employed LCsolution software (Ver-
sion 1.24). The analytical column used was a Gemini C18
(250 × 4.6mm; particle size 5µm, Phenomenex, Torrance,
Calif, USA). The mobile phases consisted of solvent A (H2O)
and solvent B (Acetonitrile) with the isocratic elution. The
column temperature was maintained at 40◦C. The analysis
was carried out at a ﬂowrate of 1.0mL/min with PDA
detectionfrom190–400nm.Theinjectionvolumewas10µL.
2.5. Standard Solution and Calibration Curves. Standard
stock solutions of morroniside and loganin (all 1,000µg/mL)
were prepared in methanol and held stored 4◦C. Work-
ing standard solutions were prepared by serial dilution
of stock solutions with methanol. All calibration curves
were obtained from assessment of peak areas of standard
solutions in the concentration ranges: morroniside, 2.34–
300.00µg/mL; loganin, 2.34–300.00µg/mL.
2.6. Animal Experimental Design. Five-week-old pathogen-
free male BALB/c mice, routinely screened serologically for
relevant pathogens, were purchased from the Orient Bio
Co. (Seongnam, Korea). Mice were maintained in an animal
facility under standard laboratory conditions for 1 week
prior to experiments and were provided with water and stan-
dard chow ad libitum. Prior to treatment with APAP, mice
were fasted, as indicated below. All experimental procedures
were carried out in accordance with NIH Guidelines for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all animal
handling conformed to the requirements of the National
Animal Welfare Law of Korea.
Mice were divided into the following treatment groups
(n = 8 or 9mice/group): (1) control group, (2) APAP group,
(3)silymarin+AP APgr oup ,(4)ECO100+AP APgr oup ,(5)
ECO250+APAPgroup,and(6)ECO500+APAPgroup,(7)
ECO 500 group.

only with distilled water; the other ﬁve groups were pre-
treated daily with ECO (100, 250, or 500mg/kg) or silymarin
(200mg/kg)orallyfor7consecutivedays.Silymarinhasbeen
usedinclinicalpracticeforthetreatmentoftoxicliverdisease
[19]; thus, in this study, it was used as a positive control. Six
hoursaftertheﬁnaltreatment,acuteliverinjurywasinduced
in all groups, except the ECO500 group, by intraperitoneal
(i.p) injection of 200mg/kg APAP (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Mo,
USA) in warm phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The
mice were starved for 18 hr after APAP treatment and then
were sacriﬁced. Blood was collected from abdominal veins,
and plasma was separated and stored at −80◦C for later
analysis of biochemical parameters. The liver was quickly
excised and divided into portions. Liver pieces were stored
at −80◦C for analysis of enzymes or ﬁxed in 10% neutralized
formalin for histological examination.
2.7. Preparation of Liver Tissue Homogenate and Determi-
nation of Protein Content. Liver tissue (100mg) was added
to 500µLo f5 0m MT r i sb u ﬀer (pH 7.4) containing 1mM
EDTA and 10µg/mL leupeptin and was homogenized usingEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3
an ultrasonic homogenizer (Sonoplus, Bandelin, Berlin,
Germany).Thehomogenatewascentrifugedat10,000xgfor
15minat4◦C,andtheupperlayerwascollectedandstoredat
−80◦C for SOD, CAT, HO-1, and GSH assays. The total pro-
tein concentration in collected supernatant was determined
colorimetrically using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-
RadLaboratories,Calif,USA)toallowantioxidantenzymatic
activity to be expressed on a per-gram-protein basis.
2.8. Biochemical Analysis of Plasma Marker Enzymes. Eigh-
teen hours after APAP treatment, plasma was collected and
separated for measurement of aspartate transaminase (AST),
alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) enzymatic activities. Plasma was collected following
centrifugation of blood for 10min at 10,000rpm. The levels
of AST, ALT, and LDH were determined using an auto-
analyzer (Beckman, Calif, USA, or ADVIA, Tokyo, Japan).
2.9. Lipid Peroxidation in Liver. Lipid peroxidation was
analyzed by the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) using
a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Mich, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, liver tissue
was homogenized in RIPA buﬀer (50mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0,
150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5mM EDTA, 1mM PMSF) and
centrifuged at 1,600 × gf o r1 0 m i na t4 ◦C. Supernatant
(0.1mL) was mixed with a sodium dodecyl sulfate solution
(0.1mL) and color reagent (4mL). The mixture was heated
to 100◦C for 1hr and then rapidly cooled. Absorbance was
measured at 532nm using a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, UK).
2.10. Determination of SOD, CAT, and GSH in Liver.
Liver tissue supernatants obtained from the liver tissue
homogenization were used to determine the SOD, CAT, and
HO-1 activities. The SOD activity in the liver tissues was
determined using a SOD assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.,
Mich, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. CAT
activity in liver tissue was determined with a Catalase assay
kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Mich, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. GSH level of liver tissues was
measured using liver tissue supernatant with a commercial
kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Mich, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was measured
at 405nm using a microtiter plate reader.
2.11. Measurement of HO-1 Activity. HO-1 activity in the
liver tissues was measured using a Mouse Heme Oxygenase-
1 EIA Kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to manufac-
turer’s protocol.
2.12. Liver Index and Histopathological Analysis. The liver
index was calculated as liver weight divided by body weight.
Liver tissues ﬁxed in formalin were embedded in paraﬃn,
cut into 4-µm thick sections, mounted on glass slides, and
stainedwithhematoxylinandeosinsolution(H&E)(Sigma-
Aldrich Co., Mo, USA). Stained sections were coverslipped
using Dako-mounting medium (Dakocytomation, Calif,
USA).
2.13. Statistical Analysis. All results are presented as mean ±
SEM. Statistical analyses of the data were carried out using
ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison analysis, and
values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Optimization of the Chromatographic Conditions. We
obtained satisfactory separation using mobile phases con-
sisting of solvent A (H2O) and solvent B (Acetonitrile). The
HPLC chromatogram of reference compounds and C. oﬃc-
inalis extract was shown in Figure 1. Using optimized chro-
matography conditions, two compounds were eluted before
20min and showed good resolution in sample analysis.
3.2. HPLC Determination of Morroniside and Loganin from
C. oﬃcinalis. The standard curves for morroniside and
loganin are Y = 19978.75x + 22514.05 (R2 = 1.0000) and
Y = 17047.30x + 21728.07 (R2 = 0.9999), respectively.
Retention time of morroniside and loganin were 5.908min
and 10.739min, respectively. Chemical structures of major
constituents in C. oﬃcinalis are shown in Figure 2. Figure 1
shows chromatograms of reference compounds and C.
oﬃcinalis extract, with detection of eluent at 240nm. The
contents (n = 3) of morroniside and loganin were 9.63mg/g
and 5.82mg/g, respectively, and summarized in Table 1.
3.3. Biochemical Analysis of Plasma Marker Enzymes. Plasma
levels of AST, ALT, and LDH were determined as measures
of liver function. A single administration of APAP induced
severe hepatic injury, as shown by marked increases in AST,
ALT, and LDH levels (P < 0.01). Pretreatment with ECO
signiﬁcantly reduced plasma levels of AST, ALT, and LDH in
a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 or 0.01). The recovery
from APAP-induced toxicity produced by treatment with
ECO was similar to that seen with silymarin treatment
(Figure 3).
3.4. Lipid Peroxidation in Liver. The lipid peroxidation was
examined by determining malondialdehyde (MDA) content
in liver tissue homogenate. The MDA content in APAP
group was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the control group
(approximately 206% of control). In the ECO 100, ECO 250,
ECO 500, and silymarin groups, MDA decreased by 37.5,
36.5, 41.4, and 37.3%, respectively, compared to APAP group
(Figure 4(a)).
3.5. Determination of SOD, CAT, and GSH in Liver. We
determined the level of SOD, CAT, and GSH in liver tissues.
ECO treatment signiﬁcantly prevented inhibition of SOD
activity caused by APAP toxicity compared to the APAP
group (P < 0.01) (Figure 4(b)) .W ef o u n ds u s t a i n e dl e v e lo f

3.6. Measurement of HO-1 Activity. HO-1 is an important
component of the defense against oxidative stress. We there-
fore examined the eﬀect of ECO on HO-1 activity. HO-14 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

WenextinvestigatedtheeﬀectofECOonHO-1activities
in APAP-treated animals. Interestingly, the hepatic HO-1
activities in APAP group were higher than those of control
group. Even though it was not signiﬁcant, ECO 100, ECO
250, and ECO 500 group also resulted in further elevation
of the APAP-induced HO-1 activities (Figure 5(a)). These
results demonstrate that ECO treatment further augments
HO-1 activities induced by APAP treatment and suggest that
this augmented HO-1 activities may be important for the
ECO-based hepatoprotection.
3.7. Liver Index and Histopathological Analysis. The liver
index increased signiﬁcantly in the APAP group (P < 0.01),
but this eﬀect was signiﬁcantly ameliorated by pretreatment
with of ECO at 500mg/kg (P < 0.01) (Figure 5(b)). Liver
sections stained with H & E showed features typical of
inﬂammatory hepatic tissues, including centrilobular necro-
sis, conﬁrming the hepatic damage indicated by biochemical
and enzymatic assays (Figure 6). In the three ECO treatment
groups, hepatocyte degeneration, necrosis, and inﬁltration
of inﬂammatory cells were all reduced in a dose-dependent
manner, similar to results in tissues from silymarin-treated
mice.
4. Discussion
C. oﬃcinalis or its constituents have been reported to possess
potent antioxidant properties, including hydroxyl radical
scavenging activity [4, 6]. However, potential hepatoprotec-
tive eﬀects and the possible involvement of HO-1 have not
beeninvestigated.Thepresentstudyshowedfortheﬁrsttime
that ECO has hepatoprotective properties, as evidenced by
the signiﬁcant inhibition of APAP-induced changes in liver
biochemical parameters, antioxidant enzymatic activities,
and lipid peroxidation product. We further show that HO-
1 induction may be at least partly responsible for the action
of ECO. We analyzed two compounds of C. oﬃcinalis such
as morroniside and loganin using HPLC. Our result showed
good separation in C. oﬃcinalis. On the other hand, we must
perform activity tests for these major compounds.
APAP is a well-known antipyretic and analgesic agent,
which is safe in therapeutic doses but can produce fatal
hepatic necrosis in experimental animals and humans [20,
21] and is employed as an experimental hepatotoxic agent.
Oxidative stress caused by APAP results in the release
of LDH, a marker of cell damage, and the release of
several soluble products, including ALT, and AST [20]. The
estimation of enzymes in the serum is a useful quantitative
marker of the extent and type of hepatocellular damage. The
mice treated with an overdose of APAP developed signiﬁcant
hepaticdamage,whichwasobservedbyasubstantialincrease
in the concentration of serum enzymes (AST, ALT, and
LDH).AdministrationofECOafterAPAPtreatmentresultedEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5

The MDA is a good indicator of the degree of lipid
peroxidation [22], which is closely related to APAP-induced
tissue damage. In the present study, we also observed
signiﬁcant increase (P < 0.05) in the levels of MDA in liver,
which was decreased by the administration of ECO. This
might due to hydroxyl radicals scavenging activities of ECO.

antioxidant capacity of the mice liver as evinced in decreased
activity of the antioxidant enzymes. ECO pretreatment
prevented the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities
and consequent oxidative damage to the liver.
HO-1 has been shown to be protective in several
disparate models of hepatic injuries. Some HO-1 inducers
have potential for use as eﬀective preconditioning agents in
solid organ transplantation. Curcumin, a candidate pharma-
cological preconditioning agent, was recently demonstrated
to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury and this
protection was mediated through HO-1 induction [26].
It has been reported that expression of HO-1 is rapidly
upregulated in the liver following administration of toxic
doses of acetaminophen [27, 28]. Chiu et al. demonstrated
a time dependent induction of HO-1 in the liver following
treatment of rats with a toxic dose of acetaminophen,
and pretreatment with hemin prevented acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity [29]. In this study, pretreatment of ECO
resulted in further elevation of the APAP-induced HO-1
activities but it was not signiﬁcant.
In addition, pretreatment with ECO prevented hepatic
necrosis, an important histopathological feature of APAP-
induced hepatotoxicity [30].
The present study has demonstrated that the ECO exerts
