Schultz-Bip (Asteraceae) is widely used worldwide in traditional medicine forthe treatment of convulsions and culture-bound syndromes such as susto (fear). The aim of this work was toevaluate the anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like eﬀects of an aqueous extract of T. parthenium in behavioralparadigms in mice. The eﬀects of T. parthenium were compared with those produced by anxiolytic andantidepressant drugs.

The antidepressant-like eﬀect was evaluated in the Forced Swimming Test(FST), and ambulatory activity was assessed in the Open Field Test (OFT). Employing the behavioral tests,synergism and antagonism experiments with Alprazolam, Muscimol, and Picrotoxin were carried out in thePMT. In a series of independent experiments, concomitant administration of T. parthenium and Alprazolam,Fluoxetine, or p-chlorophenylalanine were conducted in the FST.For chemical characterization, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electro Spray Ionization-MassSpectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis was performed.Results: T. parthenium exerts clear anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like eﬀects in mice, without aﬀecting theambulatory activity of the experimental subjects.Conclusions: Anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like T. parthenium eﬀects result, at least part from the involve-ment of the GABAergic system. Our results support the use of Tanacetum parthenium in traditional medicineand suggest its therapeutic potential in the comorbid anxiety and depression.1. IntroductionTanacetum parthenium L. Schultz-Bip (Asteraceae) is a bushyaromatic plant with feathery leaves and daisy like ﬂowers, dueresemblance to matricaria, it is known as feverfew, is a perennialspecies native to Eurasia, speciﬁcally the Balkan Peninsula, Anatoliaand the Caucasus. However, cultivation has spread it around the world,and it is now also found in the remainder of Europe, in North America,and in Chile (Jeﬀrey, 2001; Pareek et al., 2011). It has adapted toMexico, where it is known by several popular synonyms, includingaltamiza (feverfew), and hierba de Santa María (St. Mary's grass),manzanilla grande (large feverfew), manzanilla romana (Romanchamomile), mastranzo, matlali, and yerba santa. At the State ofMéxico; Otomí ethnia recognizes it as dhata manzanilla. TheNáhuatlacas' native culture of Tlaxcala state is also known as calteme-sha, and it is found distributed throughout the entire country,(Villaseñor and Espinosa, 1998). In traditional medicine in Denmark,T. parthenium is utilized in the prophylactic treatment of migraine,epilepsy, and convulsions, as well as a sedative and a sleep inducer(Jäger et al., 2006, 2009).http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.023Received 7 November 2016; Received in revised form 9 February 2017; Accepted 14 February 2017⁎ Corresponding author.E-mail address: estrarosa@hotmail.com (R.

All rights reserved.MARKIn Mexican traditional medicine, T. parthenium is used to relieveailments, such as fevers, migraine, headache, rheumatoid arthritis,stomachache, toothache, and as an analgesic, anti-inﬂammatory, andantispasmodic agent. This species is also employed to treat culture-bound syndromes such as susto (roughly translated as fear), espanto(nervousness), or quemados (burns) (Diccionario enciclopédico de laMedicina Tradicional Mexicana, 2009; Bourbonnais-Spear et al., 2007;Estrada-Reyes et al., 2014). Within this cross-cultural construction ofillness, there is an association between beliefs of susto and depression.Susto has also been associated with social role stress and depressivesymptoms (Weller et al., 2008) and espanto has been related withnervousness or nerves, to communicate anxiety and emotional distress(Mendenhall et al., 2012). Furthermore, although its etiology is an areaof active research, American Psychiatry Association (DSMV, 2013)associates susto with mental disorders, including a number of anxietyand fear-related conditions (i.e., Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder[PTSD], anxiety disorder, major depressive disorders, somatoformdisorders, and other speciﬁed neurotic disorders).Phytochemical studies of this species have demonstrated a largenumber of secondary metabolites including sesquiterpene lactones,such as parthenolide, santamarin, and other potentially active consti-tuents including ﬂavonols such as santin, and ﬂavonoid glycosides suchas 6-hydroxykaempferol derivatives, quercetagetin, apigenin and api-genin 7-glucuronide, and luteolin, among others (Majdi et al., 2011;Long et al., 2003; Chávez and Chávez, 1999; Williams et al., 1999a and1999b).On the other hand, in humans, there are high levels of comorbiditybetween anxiety and depression disorders (Kessler et al., 2010; Kelseyand Collimore, 2014), that share neural pathways; thus, numerousneurotransmitters systems are involved in the underlying mechanismsof anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs.GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mamma-lian Central Nervous System (CNS) and plays an important role inepilepsy and anxiety (Olsen and DeLorey, 1999; Möhler, 2006;Treiman, 2001). Therefore, it is not surprising that modulation ofGABAergic transmission comprises one of the main mechanisms forcontrolling these disorders (Morimoto et al., 2004; Sherif and Ahmed,1995; Beleboni et al., 2004). Is widely known that anxiolytic drugs suchas the Benzodiazepines (BDZ) act to enhance the eﬀect of GABA at theGABAA receptor, even more so, some antidepressant derivatives ofBDZ, such as Alprazolam, not only induce anxiolytic actions, but alsohave antidepressant eﬀects; thus, they are useful in the treatment ofcomorbid anxiety and depression.The aim of this work was to investigate the anxiolytic- andantidepressant-like eﬀects of an aqueous extract of T. parthenium inbehavioral paradigms in mice. The main constituents of T. partheniumwere determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-ElectroSpray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis.The anxiolytic eﬀect of T. parthenium was evaluated utilizing theBurying Behavior Test (BBT) and the Plus-Maze Test (PMT), and theresults compared with the eﬀects of Diazepam (DZ), and Alprazolam(ALP). The antidepressant-like eﬀect of T. parthenium was evaluatedwith the Forced Swimming Test (FST) and compared with the eﬀects ofFluoxetine (FLX) and ALP. The eﬀects of T. parthenium on locomotoractivity were evaluated in the Open Field Test (OFT).We also explored the possible neurotransmission pathways thatunderlie T. parthenium actions using synergism with sub-eﬀective dosesof the GABAergic agonist, muscimol, with non-eﬀective doses of T.parthenium. T. parthenium anxiolytic actions were blocked by co-administration of T. parthenium at 5 mg/kg with Picrotoxin, aGABAergic antagonist in the PMT. Finally, in independents experiments,T. parthenium antidepressant eﬀects included enhancement with the co-administration of a T. parthenium non-eﬀective dose in combination witha non-eﬀective FLX or ALP dose in the FST, and their actions wereblocked by the combination of T. parthenium eﬀective doses with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a serotoninergic full antagonist.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialLeaves of Tanacetum parthenium Asteraceae (before;Chrysanthemum parthenium) were collected in July 2014 in theEstado de México Municipality of Zinacantepec, Contadero deMatamoros (San José) México, in the yard of a private home19°03′47″N 99°54′47″W altitude, 3073 m above sea level.Botanical identiﬁcation was carried out by Óscar Hinojosa-Espinosa, M. SC., and a sample was deposited in the UniversidadNacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) National Herbarium (voucherspecimen number: MEXU1392990).The aerial parts of Tanacetum parthenium were air-dried andﬁnely ground and aqueous extracts were prepared at a ratio of 10 g ofvegetal material per 90 mL of boiling distilled water and heated for10 min. The resulting extract was allowed to cool to room temperature,ﬁltered, and dried in a Heto FD3 freezer dryer at –50 °C and 0.01mBar, yielding 15.1% (1.51 g) of dried aqueous extract. The extract wasstored −4 °C until pharmacological assays or HPLC analyses wereperformed. To facilitate HPLC analysis, 20-mg aliquots of the aqueousextract were ﬁltered through an OASIS Waters HLB 1 cc pre-column,eluted with H2O, H2O-MeOH mixtures (80:20, 50:50, and 20:80),MeOH, and MeCN prior to HPLC analysis.2.1.1. Aqueous extract analysis by HPLC-ESI-MSThe aqueous extract was analyzed by Aligent Technologies 1200Series HPLC, utilizing a Millennium Chromatography Manager (464)system, with an Ultraviolet (UV) Detector of Diode (DAD) rearrange-ment (Waters 2996). Reverse-phase separation was conducted at roomtemperature, employing a Synergi Polar-RP 80A 150×2.00 mm I.D.,with a 4 -µm particle size. The column was eluted at a ﬂow-rate of0.2 mL/min, in gradient mode, with mixtures of MeOH/H2O (3:97;5 min), MeOH/H2O (80:20; 40 min), and H2O (5 min), for a totalruntime of 50 min. Elution was monitored at 220 and 254 nm. HPLCwas coupled to a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 6000 mass spectrometer.An aliquot of the aqueous extract was ﬁltered through C18 WatersSep-Pak® cartridges. Three fractions were obtained and injected intothe HPLC system. Santin [1] and santamarin [2] were previouslyisolated from organic extracts of Tanacetum parthenium and served asstandards. HPLC peaks were not corrected for response factors and arereported as relative percentage of the area (Estrada-Reyes et al., 2010).The identity and purity of the standards were conﬁrmed by theirphysical and chemical properties and their spectral data (1H and 13CNuclear Magnetic Resonance [NMR] and MS), by means of comparisonwith results described in the literature.2.2. Pharmacological evaluations2.2.1. AnimalsAdult male Swiss Webster mice (weighing 20–30 g) were obtainedfrom the Vivarium at the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de laFuente Muñiz (INPRFM) Vivarium. All animals were housed eight percage in a temperature-controlled (20–21 °C) room under invertedlight:dark conditions (12 h:12 h, lights on at 22:00 h). All behavioralevaluations were performed between 10:00 and 14:00 h. Animals hadad libitum access to Purina rodent chow and water. The animals weremanaged in agreement with The General Principles of LaboratoryAnimal Care (NIH publication #85-23, revised in 1985) and the'Norma Oﬁcial Mexicana' (NOM-062-ZOO-1999); furthermore, theexperimental protocol was approved by the local ethical committee(NC093620.0).2.2.2. Drugs and dosageDoses are expressed as milligrams of drug per kilogram of BodyWeight (BW) per mouse. T. parthenium (TP) (0.5, 1.0, 5, 10, 20, andJ. Cárdenas et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 200 (2017) 22–302340 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl) and administered orally(p.o.) by gastric gavage. Diazepam (DZ; 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg),Muscimol (MUS; 0.5 mg/kg),Fluoxetine (FLX; 10 mg/kg), p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA;100 mg/kg), Picrotoxin (PTX; 0.5 mg/kg), and Alprazolam (ALP;0.062, 1.25, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, (Mexico City, Mexico). These were dissolved in saline andadministered Intraperitoneally (IP). Control animals received the samevolume of the vehicle (saline, 0.9% NaCl). For habituation, all micereceived a daily p.o. or IP administration of saline for 5 days prior totreatment. Each treatment had its own control group, which wastreated with the corresponding vehicle. Drugs were administered30 min before the test, and all experiments were performed withindependent groups of eight mice each.2.2.2.1. Burying Behavior Test (BBT). Mice were individually testedin a cage with exactly the same dimensions as the home cages(15×24×11 cm), but with an electriﬁed prod (7 cm long) emergingfrom one of its walls, 2 cm above the bedding material of ﬁne sawdust.Each time the animal touched the prod, the former received an electricshock of 0.3 mA. The source of the shock was a constant currentshocker (direct current apparatus, manufactured by Eng. SalvadorAlmanza, Bioengineering Department, INPRFM). The prod remainedelectriﬁed throughout the test. Immediately after the placement of theanimal in the cage, its behavior was recorded for 10 min. Once theanimal received the ﬁrst shock, it typically moved toward the prod,recognizing it as an aversive stimulus. The animal then sprayed andpushed a pile of bedding material ahead with rapid alternatingmovements of its forepaws. The parameters registered in this anxietytest were burying behavior latency (time, in sec, from the ﬁrst shock tothe display of the burying behavior) and cumulative burying behavior(cumulative time, in sec, that the animals spend burying the prod). Inthis test, a decrease in cumulative burying behavior is interpreted as areduction in anxiety (Pinel and Treit, 1978; Treit, 1985; De Boer andKoolhaas, 2003; López-Rubalcava et al., 2006). An increase in buryingbehavior latency is considered to reﬂect decreased reactivity (thereadiness of the animal to respond to a certain condition).2.2.2.2. Elevated Plus-Maze Test (PMT). This model has been widelyvalidated for measuring anxiolytic-like eﬀects in rodents (Lister, 1987).The apparatus consisted of two opposite open arms (30×8 cm),intersected (center platform) by two closed arms of the samedimensions, with 19-cm-high walls. The arms were connected to an8×8 cm central square. The apparatus was elevated 55 cm above theﬂoor, in a dimly illuminated room. Mice were placed individually in thecenter of the plus-maze, facing an open arm. During the 5-min test, thetime spent in each arm was measured. The conventional spatial-temporal measurements comprised the number of entries (all pawson open or closed arms and expressed as percentage of total entries),Time spent in the Open Arms (TOA) was expressed as a percentage ofthe Time spent in the Open Arms (TOA), % TOA=TOA/TCA×100 (Timespent in Closed Arms; TCA), % Open Arm Entries (% OAE), OAE=OpenArm Entries/[Closed Arm Entries+Open Arm Entries]×100 and timeon the Central Platform (TC)=[TOA+TBC] −300; (300 s=test time, insuch a way that TOA+TCA+TC=300 s). Percentage of time and numberof entries in the open arms are considered indices of anxiety-levelbehavior (Lister, 1987; Rocha et al., 2002). Ethological behaviors, suchas time spent on the Central Platform (CP) and number of head dippingwas also registered.2.2.2.3. Forced Swimming Test (FST). Mice were individually placedinto glass cylinders (height: 21 cm, diameter; 14.5 cm) containing15 cm of water at 23 ± 1 °C. All animals were forced to swim for a15-min period (pre-test), followed by a 3-min swimming session (test)24 h later. Total immobility time was measured in sec. Immobilitybehavior was scored when the mouse remained ﬂoating and treadingwater just suﬃciently to keep its nose above water. After the swimmingsessions, the mice were removed from the cylinder and carefully dried,placed in heated cages for 20 min, and then returned to their homecages. All experimental sessions were videotaped and later scored by anobserver who was unaware of the pharmacological treatments (Porsoltet al., 1977a, 1977b; Martínez-Vázquez et al., 2012).2.2.2.4. Open Field Test (OFT). To discard possible unwanted ornonspeciﬁc side eﬀects of drug treatments on locomotor activity, alltreatments studied in the anxiety and depression paradigms wereanalyzed in the Open Field Test (OFT). The OFT system (LE8825,Panlab InfraRed (IR) Harvard apparatus) consisted of Perspex panels(45×45 cm, 2.2-cm thick) in a 2-Dimensional (2D) (X and Y axes)square frame, a frame support, and a control unit. Each frame countedemployed 16×16 infrared beams for optimal subject detection. Theframes were controlled by independent control units. Acti Tracksoftware was utilized to analyze the animals' trajectories. Data wereexported to a computer for analysis. The number of times the animalentered each square (counts/10 min) was recorded. A change in countswas considered an alteration in the locomotor activity of theexperimental subject, produced by the drugs (Estrada-Reyes et al.,2014).To explore the participation of the GABAergic system in theanxiolytic- and antidepressant-like actions of T. parthenium, thefollowing experiments were performed.Experiment I: PTX at 0.5 mg/kg was administered simulta-neously with T. parthenium (5 mg/kg; −30 min) to mice, followed bytesting in the PMT.Experiment II: One group was treated with a non-eﬀective doseof the GABAA agonist muscimol (MUS; 0.5 mg/kg) jointly with athreshold dose of T. parthenium (0.5 mg/kg), insuﬃcient to induceanxiolytic eﬀects. After 30 min, the mice were subjected to the PMT todetermine the possible synergic eﬀect.Experiment III: Sub-threshold doses of alprazolam (ALP,0.03 mg/kg), an anxiolytic, triazolobenzodiazepine (thiazolo-BDZ),and T. parthenium (0.5 mg/kg) were administered together to micethat, after 30 min, were subjected to the PMT.To determine whether antidepressant drugs are able to block orenhance the antidepressant-like eﬀects of T. parthenium in the forcedswimming paradigm, experiments to antagonize and synergize thedrug were designed.Experiment I: A group was treated with T. parthenium at a singlesub-eﬀective dose (5 mg/kg) in combination with a sub-threshold doseof Fluoxetine (FLX; 10 mg/kg), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Thirtymin later the mice were tested in the FST.Experiment II: Two independent groups of eight animals eachwere pretreated with PCPA (100 mg/kg, an inhibitor of serotoninsynthesis), and a third group was given only the vehicle, once a day,for 4 consecutive days (Cassani et al., 2014). After the last adminis-tration of PCPA, one group was treated with T. parthenium (20 mg/kg,p.o.) and the remaining groups only received vehicle. Then, all micewere tested in the FST 30 min later.2.2.2.5. Statistical analysis. Results are present as the mean ±Standard Error of the Mean (SEM). Data were analyzed withKruskal–Wallis ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) on ranks (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001), followed by the Mann–Whitney ranksum test. The SigmaPlot ver. 12.5 statistical software program was usedto make the graphics and to conduct the analysis.J. Cárdenas et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 200 (2017) 22–30243. Results3.1. Chemical Analysis of aqueous extract of T. partheniumSantin and santamarine were isolated from the organic extracts andutilized as standards in the HPLC-MS analysis. Sesquiterpene lactones,such as parthenolide or canin, were not isolated from the organicextract and were not identiﬁed in the aqueous extract of T. parthenium.The aqueous extract of T. parthenium was found to contain the ﬂavonesantin [1] at 7.4% (relative abundance), and santamarine [2] (anisomeric form of parthenolid), a sesquiterpene lactone, was found at4% (Fig. 1). It has been described that parthenolid is present only intrace in Mexican samples of feverfew (Hausen, 1981).The BBT was employed to measure the anxiolytic eﬀects of diﬀerentdoses of T. parthenium aqueous extract. As presented in Table 1, T.parthenium at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg decreased the cumulative time thatanimals spent burying the prod and increased burying behavior latencyin a dose-dependent fashion; this eﬀect was similar to the resultsproduced by DZ at 0.5 mg/kg. The one-way ANOVA on ranks revealedthat for the two parameters analyzed (cumulative burying behavior andburying behavior latency), both T. parthenium and DZ exhibitedstatistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences with respect to the control group(H=29.420; df=5; p≤0.001).3.2. Eﬀects of increasing doses of T. parthenium on the PMT aredepicted in Fig. 2The acute treatment with T. parthenium at 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kgproduced a signiﬁcant increase in both % of time spent in the openarms (H=30.22; df=6; p≤0.001), and percentage of open-arm entries(H=32.75; df=6; p≤00.1) compared with the vehicle-treated group.Similarly, mice treated with DZ at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 mg/kg produced a signiﬁcant increase in % of time spent in the open armsin a dose-dependent manner (H=32.292; df=4; p≤0.001) and percen-tage of open-arm entries (H=28.530; df=4; p≤0.001), and mice treatedwith ALP at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg also spent signiﬁcantly more time onthe open arms and presented an increased percentage of entries on theopen arms. At higher doses (20 and 40 mg/kg), T. parthenium did notproduce changes compared with the vehicle-treated group.Other parameters measured in the PMT are illustrated in Table 2.Animals treated with T. parthenium (1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) alsodemonstrated increases in time spent in head dipping (H=20.410;df=6; p≤0.01), while time spent on the CP only increased signiﬁcantlywith T. parthenium at 40 mg/kg (H=13.6; df=6; p≤0.03). Likewise,total arm entries diﬀered only at major T. parthenium doses (20 and40 mg/kg) from those of the vehicle-treated group.In the FST, as presented in Fig. 3, T. parthenium at 10-, 20-, and40-mg/kg doses signiﬁcantly reduced immobility time with respect tothe control group (H=33.590; df=5; p≤0.001). In a similar manner,ALP at 0.03 and 0.062 mg/kg signiﬁcantly reduced immobility timecompared with the control group (H=22.10; df=2; p≤0.001). Incontrast with T. parthenium and ALP, acute FLX administration wasnot able to modify the immobility behavior, this fact in concordancewith those previously reported (Martínez-Vázquez et al., 2012).All of the drugs were tested in the OFT, and the eﬀects of T.parthenium on the locomotor and exploratory activity of the experi-mental animals are exhibited in Table 3. T. parthenium did not modifythe count number (H=19.18; df=6; p=0.51) or alter the rearing number(H=12, df=6, p=0.06) compared with the control group, T. partheniumdid not alter any exploratory parameters in the OFT. In addition, nodrug modiﬁed the ambulatory behavior of the animals tested (data notshown).3.3. Eﬀects of co-administration of T. parthenium plus PTX and plusALP in the PMTTo determine whether the GABAergic antagonist Picrotoxin couldblock the anxiolytic actions of T. parthenium, an anxiolytic dose of T.parthenium (5 mg/kg) was jointly administered with PTX at 0.5 mg/kg; after 30 min, the experimental animals were subjected to the PMT.As can be observed in Table 4, treatment with PTX alone at 0.5 mg/kgdid not produce any eﬀect in comparison with the control group, whilethis same PTX dose was able to block the anxiolytic eﬀect produced byT. parthenium when the two were jointly administered. In addition, theT. parthenium /PTX combination reduced the % of time spent in openarms by 70% with respect to the control group.OOOHH3COOCH3OCH3HOsantin [1]OOOHHsantamarine [2]RT= 33.6 min, C18H16O7     RT= 30.3 min, C15H20O3Exact mass 344.3154 Exact mass 248.1412 Fig. 1.

Our results revealed that the combination of T.parthenium /ALP at a non-eﬀective dose, signiﬁcantly increased timeand percentage spent in open arms and reduced time spent in closedarms in the PMT, compared with the control group (Table 4).3.4. Eﬀects of co-administration of T. parthenium plus ALP, plus FLX,and plus PCPA in the FSTTo determine whether ALP could enhance the antidepressant-likeactions of T. parthenium, a combination of non-eﬀective doses of T.parthenium (5 mg/kg) and ALP (0.03 mg/kg) were co-administeredand the eﬀect was evaluated in the FST. As demonstrated in Fig. 3,ALP, a benzodiazepine-type antidepressant drug at 0.03 mg/kg, incombination with 5 mg/kg of T. parthenium, providing an antidepres-sant-like eﬀect with a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the Mann–Whitney test: T=97; n=8, and p≤0.001. Likewise, the combination ofthreshold doses of T. parthenium with a single, non-eﬀective dose ofFLX (10 mg/kg) facilitated the antidepressant actions of T. parthenium(T=89; n=8; p=0.001) compared with the control-treated group.We explored the involvement of the 5-HT system in the antide-pressant-like eﬀect of T. parthenium. For this purpose, 5-HT wasdepleted by means of the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlor-ophenylalanine (PCPA, 100 mg/kg, i.p., 4 days) prior to treatment withthe T. parthenium eﬀective dose (20 mg/kg). The consequent resultsshowed that PCPA blocked the anti-immobility eﬀect of T. parthenium,because the group treated with T. parthenium plus PCPA did notexhibit a signiﬁcant diﬀerence with respect to the control group(Mann–Whitney test: T=51; n=8; p=0.08).4.

Cárdenas et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 200 (2017) 22–3027depressive disorders concurrently have generally exhibited greaterlevels of functional impairment, reduced quality of life, and poorertreatment outcomes compared with individuals with only one of thesedisorders (Lamers et al., 2011).As mentioned previously, Tanacetum parhtenium is employed byseveral medical conditions, although to date, few in vivo experimentshave been carried out. In the present work and, to our knowledge forthe ﬁrst time, we studied the eﬀects of the aqueous extract of T.parhtenium on the Central Nervous System (CNS).One of main purposes of the present study was to analyze theanxiolytic-like eﬀects of the aqueous extract of T. parthenium. To allowfor this, the eﬀects of T. parthenium were evaluated in two predictiveanimal models of anxiety. In the ﬁrst assay, experimental anxietyvalues were determined employing the defensive burying behavior test;this is a conﬂict model largely validated for the study of both anxiolyticand anxiogenic drugs (Treit, 1985; López-Rubalcava et al., 2006). Ourresults revealed that the aqueous extract of T. parthenium at 5, 10, and20 mg/kg produced a signiﬁcant dose-dependent reduction comparedwith the control group in burying accumulative time, similar to theeﬀects of Diazepam (DZ). It has been reported that compounds withanxiolytic actions decrease burying behavior, conjointly with burying-time latency. Some authors have considered that this behavior is theanimals' reactivity in an inverse manner and indicate that classicanxiolytics such as Benzodiazepines (BDZ) decrease reactivity, (López-Rubalcava et al., 2000). It is noteworthy that, herein, the decrease inburying behavior was not accompanied by an increase in buryingbehavior latency; thus, unlike DZ, T. parthenium clearly produced ananxiolytic-like eﬀect without aﬀecting animal reactivity. The anxiolyticeﬀect of T. parthenium was also evaluated in the elevated Plus-MazeTest (PMT) (Lister, 1987; López-Rubalcava et al., 2006). The anxioly-tic-like eﬀect of TP was indicated by a signiﬁcant increase in both entrynumber and time spent in open arms. These responses were observedat lower doses of 0.5–10 mg/kg, achieving best eﬀect at 5- and 10-mg/kg doses. Frequency of entries is the natural spatiotemporal index ofanxiety; it is reduced by anxiolytic drugs such as DZ and can beincreased by anxiogenic drugs such as picrotoxin (PTX) (López-Rubalcava et al., 2000). In agreement with these ﬁndings, we foundthat T. parthenium demonstrated an anxiolytic proﬁle similar to that ofthis antianxiety drug. Reduction of time spent on the Central Platform(CP) comprises another index of a reduced “decision-making” (hesitantbehavior) behavior. Both parameters are accepted as reliable indicatorsof anxiety and fearfulness (Rocha et al., 2002). T. parthenium at anydose did not alter time spent on CP or in total arm entries. Theseobservations also indicate that the anxiolytic-like eﬀect of T. parthe-nium is selective and is not associated with a general stimulation oflocomotor activity as a consequence of exposure to a novel environ-ment. These facts were also conﬁrmed by Open Field Test (OFT)results, which did not show any change in the locomotor activity ofmice treated with T. parthenium. The anxiolytic eﬀects induced by inthe PMT were similar to those produced by DZ, an anxiolytic andsedative BDZ that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA atthe BDZ site. Additionally, T. parthenium actions were also comparedwith those induced with alprazolam (ALP), a full agonist to the GABAAreceptor (Rang et al., 1996; Hascoet and Bourin, 1997) that, inaddition to its anxiolytic eﬀects produces antidepressant eﬀects.Thus, the three drugs demonstrated a similar anxiolytic eﬀect, withALP that of greatest pharmacological potency.To explore the possible involvement of the GABAergic neurotrans-mitter system in the anxiolytic actions of T. parthenium, we conductedindependent synergic experiments in which non-eﬀective doses of T.parthenium (0.5 mg/kg) and sub-threshold doses of MUS (0.5 mg/kg)or ALP (0.12 mg/kg) were jointly administered. Our results revealedthat the anxiolytic-like eﬀect of T. parthenium in the PMT wasenhanced with both concomitant administration of T. partheniumwith MUS as well as with ALP. Furthermore, PTX is a non-competitiveantagonist of the GABAA receptor that speciﬁcally acts at a siteassociated with the chloride channel preventing the inhibitory actionof GABA, which increase anxiety levels (Petty et al., 1995). In thisstudy, this drug was able to completely block the actions of T.parthenium in the PMT. It could be concluded that T. partheniuminteracts with this neurotransmitter system to mediate its anxiolytic-like actions or T. parthenium contains compounds that facilitateGABAergic transmission. In this regard, the anxiolytic actions ofnumerous ﬂavonoid compounds have been described (Estrada-Reyeset al., 2012; 2014); thus, it is likely that santin [1] could becontributing to the actions of T. parthenium. In addition, these resultsare consistent with those previously reported in an in vitro assay (Jägeret al., 2009). Taken together, these results suggest that T. partheniuminteracts with the GABAA receptor, probably at GABAA receptorsubtypes, in binding sites diﬀerent from those at classical BDZ eﬀects,produce anxiolytic eﬀects. However, it is necessary to conduct speciﬁcstudies to determine the speciﬁc target.On the basis of T. parthenium in traditional medicine, anotherpurpose was evaluated in this study of its antidepressant-like action inthe Forced Swimming Test (FST) in mice. The FST induces a state ofimmobility in animals facing an inescapable situation of swimming;such immobility behavior has been hypothesized to reﬂect hopeless-ness, which may in turn reﬂect an aspect observed in depressivedisorders in humans. Thus, the antidepressant-like activity of a drug isexpressed by a decrease in the immobility of animals subjected to theFST. Our results demonstrated that T. parthenium induced a dose-dependent reduction of immobility time in the FST at 10, 20, and40 mg/kg: this antidepressant eﬀect was similar to that produced byALP (Rang et al., 1996; Hascoet and Bourin, 1997; Hascoet andBourin, 1997).Monoaminergic, serotoninergic, and noradrenergic systems areknown to play major roles in major depression (Perona et al., 2008).However, the GABA system also participates in the antidepressantactions of thiazole-BDZ such as ALP that, in addition to enhancing therelease of serotonin (5-HT) in the hippocampus to produce antide-pressant actions, may act by means of a GABAergic mechanism that isindependent of the BDZ-site receptor (Jonas and Cohon, 1993; Kalueﬀand Nutt, 2007; Al-Tubuly et al., 2008). Thus, as may be observed inFig. 3, ﬂuoxetine (FLX) was not able to reduce immobility time in theFST, as might be expected. This fact agrees with previous reports onSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs,such as FLX at an acute dose, which does not exert an antidepressant-like eﬀect on the FST (Cassani et al., 2014, 2015).Interestingly, the combination of a sub-eﬀective dose of FLX(10 mg/kg) in combination with a non-eﬀective dose of T. parthenium(5 mg/kg) revealed to evident antidepressant activity in the FST.The synergistic antidepressant-like eﬀect produced by a sub-eﬀective dose of T. parthenium and FLX comprised an interestingresult that may derive from the eﬀect of T. parthenium in the FST andan interaction with the serotoninergic system. In accordance with ourearlier ﬁndings, we depleted 5-HT by means of the tryptophanhydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) before treatmentwith TP. PCPA blocked the antidepressant actions of T. parthenium inthe FST. These ﬁndings support the involvement of the serotoninergicneurotransmitter system in the antidepressant action of T. parthe-nium. In general, a large number of evidences indicate that theserotonin neurotransmitter system is strongly involved in the regula-tion of mood and anxiety disorders (Millan, 2003). Several pieces ofevidence have been implicated in abnormalities in serotonergic trans-mission in the pathology of depressive disorders. However, we thinkthat it is necessary to perform experiments aimed at determining thespeciﬁc mechanism underlying the anxiolytic and antidepressantactions of T. parthenium.Previous studies have shown that many psychostimulant drugs candecrease immobility behavior in the FST. These drugs also causemarked increases in the ambulatory activity of the experimentalanimals. Therefore, to avoid a false positive antidepressant eﬀect, theJ. Cárdenas et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 200 (2017) 22–3028locomotor activity of animals subjected to the FST was evaluatedemploying the OFT. Our results showed that T. parthenium signiﬁ-cantly reduced immobility time in the FST without increasing ambu-latory activity, which conﬁrmed that T. parthenium induces a clear,antidepressant-like eﬀect in the FST.In summary, numerous neurotransmitter systems underlie thestates of anxiety and depression. It is accepted that BDZ-type anxio-lytics act enhancing the eﬀect of GABA at the GABAA receptor.Although these classical BDZ are eﬀective anxiolytics, they lack theantidepressant eﬀects. In this study, we demonstrated that T. parthe-nium induced both anxiolytic and antidepressant actions that aremediated, at least in part, by its interaction with GABAA receptors.Additionally, our ﬁndings also show the involvement of the serotoner-gic neurotransmitter system in the antidepressant actions of T.parthenium.5. ConclusionsThis study showed that a single oral treatment of T. partheniuminduces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like eﬀects in several behavioralparadigms in mice. T. parthenium did not induce alterations inlocomotor activity. These results led to evidence of the participationof the GABAergic and serotonergic systems in the actions of T.parthenium. Our results support the use of Tanacetum partheniumin traditional medicine and reveal its utility for the treatment ofcomorbid disorders of depression and anxiety.Competing interestThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are indebted to Carmen Márquez, Erendira GarcíaRios, Lucero Rios and Rubén Gaviño for their technical assistance.
