Plant Physiol. (1994) 104: 67-74 Biochemical Plant Responses to Ozone' IV. Cross-lnduction of Defensive Pathways in Parsley (Petroselinum crispum 1.) Plants Heidrun Eckey-Kaltenbach, Dieter Ernst, Werner Heller, and Heinrich Sandermann, Jr.* GSF-Forschungszentrum für Umwelt und Gesundheit GmbH, lnstitut für Biochemische Pflanzenpathologie, lngolstadter Landstrasse 1, D-85758 Oberschleissheim, Germany Parsley (Petroselinum crispum 1.) is known to respond to ultra- violet irradiation by the synthesis of flavone glycosides, whereas fungal or elicitor stress leads to the synthesis of furanocoumarin phytoalexins. We tested how these defensive pathways are affected by a single ozone treatment (200 nL 1-'; 10 h). Assays were performed at the levels of transcripts, for enzyme activities, and for secondary products. The most rapid transcript accumulation was maximal at 3 h, whereas flavone glycosides and furanocou- marins were maximally induced at 12 and 24 h, respectively, after the start of ozone treatment. Ozone acted as a cross-inducer because the two distinct pathways were simultaneously induced. These results are consistent with the previously observed ozone induction of fungal and vira1 defense reactions in tobacco, spruce, and pine. The phytotoxicity of the air pollutant ozone in plants is well documented (Guderian, 1985; Treshow and Anderson, 1989). The emphasis is usually placed on detrimental effects on primary metabolism, such as photosynthesis, carbon al- location, and growth. Our previous studies in different plant species have shown that secondary metabolism provides even more strongly affected targets, because single, subacute ozone pulses were sufficient to induce genes (Sandermann et al., 1990; Emst et al., 1992b), enzymes (Sandermann et al., 1990; Galliano et al., 1993), and biosynthetic products (Guderian, 1985; Sandermann et al., 1989). These responses included the induction of stilbene phytoalexins (Rosemann et al., 1991) and of putative plant defense proteins such as /3-1,3-glucan- ase, chitinase, and PR proteins (Eckey, 1992; Schraudner et al., 1992). The results have supported the hypothesis that a major effect of ozone is to change the phytopathological disposition of plants (Sandermann et al., 1989). To further extend these studies, parsley (Petroselinum cris- pum L.) seedlings have now been exposed to ozone. Parsley represents a well-studied phytopathological model system in which two separate defensive pathways are present (Hahl- brock et al., 1976). UV irradiation induces the flavone gly- coside pathway (Hahlbrock et al., 1976; Hahlbrock and Well- mann, 1970; Hahlbrock and Scheel, 1989), whereas fungal spores or fungal elicitor induce the furanocoumarin phyto- ' This work was partially supported by Fonds der Chemischen * Corresponding author; fax 49-89-3187-3383. Industrie. 67 alexin pathway (Hahlbrock et al., 1976; Hauffe et al., 1986). Both phenylpropanoid pathways are induced from very low background levels in parsley cell-suspension cultures. In con- trast, these pathways are also present constitutively in certain tissues of intact parsley plants (Knogge et al., 1987). Flavone glycosides are localized mainly in the leaf epidermal cell layer, and furanocoumarins are localized in the leaf oil ducts. UV irradiation induced the CHS mRNA in total leaf extracts about 4- to 8-fold compared to etiolated seedlings (Schmelzer et al., 1988). The high constitutive leve1 of the furanocou- marin pathway has prevented detection of zoospore induc- tion in total leaf extracts of parsley (Knogge et al., 1987). Histochemical methods including in situ hybridization have more clearly revealed the induction of the two distinct path- ways in intact parsley leaves. UV treatment resulted in an increase of the flavone glycoside pathway in epidermal cells (Hahlbrock et al., 1976; Schmelzer et al., 1988). Funga1 infection led to furanocoumarin accumulation near the infec- tion sites and to secretion of the metabolites into infection droplets (Hahlbrock et al., 1976; Tietjen et al., 1983; Scheel et al., 1986). It will be reported in this paper that ozone acts as a cross- inducer because parameters of both defensive pathways were simultaneously induced in intact parsley plants. This study could not be performed with parsley cell-suspension cultures because of their insensitivity to ozone (Eckey, 1992). Some of the results have been communicated in abstract form (Emst et al., 1992a).

Matem (Universitat Freiburg, Germany), respectively. A molecular mass marker protein set (14.4-94 kD) was purchased from Pharmacia-LKB (Freiburg, Germany). 5- Bromo-4-chloroindolyl-3-phosphate and nitroblue tetrazo- lium were obtained from Sigma Chemie (Deisenhofen, Ger- many). The commercially available natural substances (apiin, coniferyl alcohol, xanthotoxol, bergapten, psoralen, isopim- pinellin, xanthotoxin, and umbelliferone) were purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The cDNA probes for PAL (Eli 4), CHS, 4CL, Eli 16, HRGP (Eli 9), POD (Eli ll), PR-1-1, and PR-2 from parsley were kindly supplied by Dr. I. Somssich (Max-Planck-Institut für Züchtungsforschung). These clones were described by Soms- sich et al. (1989). A ~-1,3-glucanase clone from tobacco (Mohnen et al., 1985), a superoxide dismutase clone from tobacco (Bowler et al., 1989), and a carrot extensin clone (Chen and Vamer, 1985) were donated by the respective authors. Actin-cDNA from soybean was a gift of Dr. R. B. Meagher (Shah et al., 1982). Plant Material Seeds of Petroselinum crispum L. (Hamburger Schnitt) were obtained from a local garden center. Seeds were germinated on a 2:l mixture of standard substrate (type T; Fruhstorfer, Lauterbach, Germany) and perlite in a dark environmental growth chamber. Growth conditions were 24OC and 78% RH. After 10 d in the dark, seedlings were transferred to continuous white light (150 pE m-’s-’ PPFD) for 2.5 weeks. Biochemical analyses were camed out with the pooled excised leaves (Eckey-Kaltenbach et al., 1993). Ozone Exposure If not noted otherwise, the standard ozone treatment was performed with 200 nL L-’ of ozone for 10 h under the conditions of precultivation. Ventilation was applied at 0.5 m s-’. Ozone was generated by electrical discharge in dry 02, The desired ozone concentration was maintained as described by Galliano et al. (1993). Metabolite Analysis Furanocoumarins Frozen parsley leaves (100-150 mg) were ground in liquid Nz to a powder using a Microdismembrator instrument (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). This step was followed by four consecutive extractions at 4OC with a total volume of 10 mL of methanol. After centrifugation (15,00Og, 5 min, 4OC), the methanolic extracts were concentrated to 2 mL, and 10- pL aliquots were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a Spherisorb ODSII column (5 pm; 250 X 4.6 mm; Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 mL min-’ with HzO:tetrahydrofurane (7:3, v/v) containing 1 % H3P04. The HPLC method was adopted from Knogge et al. (1987). The eluates were monitored at 300 nm with a UV-visible analyzer (absorption detector 163; Beckman, München, Germany). Peak areas were integrated and related to known amounts of reference substances. For additional identification, a diode array detector was used. Flavone Clycosides The extraction and quantification of flavone glycosides by Aa4a measurement were performed as described by Hahlbrock et al. (1976). Where noted, separation of flavone glycosides was performed with a special HPLC system adopted from Zielke and Sonnenbichler (1990). For routine identification and quantification of 6”-O-malonylapiin and apiin, the above HPLC system for determination of furanocoumarins was used. Enzyme Assays Extraction and determination of PAL activity in parsley plant material was done according to the method of Rose- mann et al. (1991). The assay used 3H-labeled Phe as sub- strate, with the 3H-labeled product cinnamic acid being ex- tracted with ethylacetate. Extraction and determination of XMT enzyme activity were performed as described by Hauffe et al. (1986). Measurement of CAD activity was carried out by the previous assay procedure (Galliano et al., 1993). Blotting Procedures Electrophoresis of protein extracts prior to westem blot analysis was performed in the presence of SDS according to the method of Laemmli (1970). A commercially available protein marker set (Pharmacia-LKB, Freiburg, Germany) was used for molecular m a s  determination. Electroblotting onto a membrane (Immobilon PVDF, Millipore, Eschbom, Ger- many) was performed according to the manufacturer’s in- structions. Transfer of proteins was monitored by staining with Ponceau S. After destaining and pretreatment with BSA, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (rabbit IgG) for 2 h. CHS antiserum was diluted by a factor of 1:4000, and MAT-3 antiserum was diluted by a factor of 1:5000. After incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-cou- pled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phos- phatase conjugate; Gibco BRL Life Sciences) in a dilution of 1:3000, the antibodies were detected by addition of 5-bromo- 4-chloroindolyl-3-phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (Eckey, 1992). The blots were scanned at 600 nm for quan- tification. Total RNA was extracted as previously described (Kuhn et al., 1984). RNA blotting and hybridization (northem and dot blot analyses) using Hybond N membranes (Amersham Buchler) were performed as described by Sambrock et al. (1989). For hybridization the cDNA probes were 32P-labeled with a random-primed DNA-labeling kit (Hexa Prime I; Appligene, Heidelberg, Germany). Autoradiograms were scanned with a densitometer (Elscript 400; Hirschmann, Un- terhaching, Germany) and quantified relative to the reprob- ing signal obtained with an actin-cDNA probe. j Microscopy and Preparation of IWF The preparation of leaf sections, aniline blue staining for callose, and general microscopic methods were carried out as  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

(1993).RESULTSOzone Effects on Parsley PlantsParsley seedlings were exposed to ozone at high RH toreduce stomatal effects. After a 10-h treatment with 200 nLL~' of ozone, the first visible symptoms appeared (Fig. 1A).Parsley leaves were scored for percentage of necrotic area oftotal leaves (Eckey-Kaltenbach et al., 1993). After the stand-ard ozone treatment (200 nL L"1, 10 h), the percentage ofnecrosis reached 40% at 24 h and 50% at 48 to 72 h (Fig.IB). Leaf damage then progressed further. The onset of ozoneexposure is defined as time zero, and postincubation inozone-free air begins at 10 h. After the seedlings were fumi-gated with only 100 nL L"1 of ozone for 10 h, the formationof lesions was delayed but then reached the same extent ofnecrosis (40% at 84 h) as in the standard fumigation. Thenecrotic area contained large amounts of callose as detectedby staining with aniline blue reagent (Fig. 1C). Under UVlight (340-380 nm), the necrotic area showed a strong bluishfluorescence, probably due to the presence of phenolic com-pounds (Fig. ID).Accumulation of Secondary MetabolitesThe leaf content of flavone glycosides and of furanocou-marins was followed during the standard ozone exposureand the postincubation period. The HPLC method used wasadopted from Knogge et al. (1987) for direct comparison withpathogen-induced secondary compounds. It yielded a goodresolution of the furanocoumarins with the following reten-tion times: umbelliferone, 7.1 min; xanthotoxin, 10.3 min;bergapten, 15.5 min; psoralen, 12.0 min; and isopimpinellin,12.3 min. Flavone glycosides appeared at 7.8 min (6"-O-malonylapiin) and 5.5 min (apiin). The healthy plants exhib-ited high constitutive levels of total furanocoumarins (aboutFigure 1.

Effect of ozone treatment on furanocoumarins (A) and flavone glycosides (B) of parsley plants. The secondary metabolites were determined at several time points in parsley plants kept in the absence of ozone (open bars) or treated during the  indicated 10-h interval with 150 nL L-' (dashed bars) or 200 nL L-' of ozone (crossed bars) (mean values & SE, n = 5 or 6) .  400 pg g-' fresh weight). In contrast, parsley cell-suspension cultures showed only about 400 ng g-' fresh weight as the basal total content after 7 d of growth (Eckey, 1992). As shown in Figure 2A, there was a 2-fold increase of total leaf furanocoumarins after the standard ozone treatment (200 nL L-', 10 h). Maximum accumulation was reached at 12 to 24 h. The individual furanocoumarins listed above were also quantified. They showed the same induction kinetics and the same extent of accumulation as the total furanocoumarins. The induction factors (1.3- to 2.7-fold) increased linearly with ozone concentration (100-250 nL L-'; 10 h). The basal amounts of furanocoumarins increased slightly with plant age, but the induction factors were independent of age. The amount of total flavones and flavonoid glycosides was measured by A340 (Hahlbrock et al., 1976) after the standard ozone fumigation. During the first 1 2  h, there was a transient 1.6-fold accumulation, as shown in Figure 28. There was a second increase 2 d after ozone treatment (at 72 h). More than 10 different but unidentified flavone compounds were detected by a special HPLC system (Zielke and Sonnenbi- chler, 1990) in the methanolic parsley plant extracts. Attempts were made to study the leaf apoplastic compart- ment, which is assumed to be the first reaction site of ozone (Heath, 1989). The IWF was collected by centrifugation after a vacuum infiltration step. Xanthotoxin and bergapten were most prominent and accumulated 7- and 2-fold at 12 h. lnduction of Biosynthetic Enzymes The enzyme PAL is involved in both the furanocoumarin and flavone glycoside biosynthetic pathways. The ozone response of this enzyme activity is shown in Figure 3A. A 3- fold increase was reached at the end of the ozone exposure period, followed by a decrease to the initial level. A second less pronounced increase in activity occurred during lesion development at 72 h. XMT was tested as a specific enzyme of furanocoumarin biosynthesis. The standard ozone treatment led to a 2-fold increase (Fig. 3B) at 12 and 24 h. CHS, a specific enzyme of the flavone glycoside pathway, could not be reliably determined because of high endogenous hydrolase activities. However, westem analysis showed a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kD (Eckey, 1992). Scanning of the alkaline phosphatase indicator stain revealed a 1.2-fold increase at 6 and 12 h (data not shown). Westem blotting was also performed' for MAT-3. In this case a single protein band with a molecular mass of 40 kD was detected (Eckey, 1992). A 1.2-fold increase was found at 12 h (data not shown). Because of the known malonylesterase activity in 2.5-week-old parsley plants (Matem, 1983), ma- lonyltransferase activity could not be determined reliably. The lignin biosynthetic enzyme CAD showed statistically significant maxima (1.5-fold) at 12 h as well as at 72 h. The basal activity of this enzyme was 125 pkat/kg of protein (Eckey, 1992). lnduction of Transcript Accumulation Northem blotting of total RNA from ozone-treated and control parsley leaves revealed that transcript amounts of A PAL-activity [pkat/kg] 35 30 4 T 25 20  15 10 5  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A comparative study of PAL transcript amountand PAL enzyme activity showed the expected difference inthe time course of the induction processes (Fig. 4B). The sametime course of transcript induction was found for 4CL aswell as for CHS, which showed a 13- and 2-fold increase,respectively.Transcripts not associated with phenylpropanoid metabo-lism were also examined using homologous stress-inducedcDNA probes. The transcripts of the two PR proteins PR-1and PR-2, as well as an elicitor-induced cDNA probe withunknown function (Eli 16; Somssich et al., 1989), showedmaximal amounts (5- to 7-fold) at 3 h.

Maximal transcript accumulation was at 3,6, and 12 h, respectively, as marked by arrowheads.genes). In phenylpropanoid metabolism, the first effects at 6h concerned the transcript amounts of PAL, 4CL, and CHS(intermediate genes). The maxima of the corresponding en-zyme activities were reached between 9 and 12 h when thefirst visible symptoms also appeared. The pathway productsshowed maximal accumulation at 12 and 24 h. At this time,transcript amounts of the late genes (POD, HRGP) alsoreached their maxima. There were secondary increases at 48to 72 h for transcript amounts (PAL, 4CL, and CHS), enzymeactivity (PAL), and product accumulation (flavone glyco-sides). All of these increases coincided with complete leafnecrosis.DISCUSSIONAn exposure of parsley plants to 100 nL L"1 of ozone for10 h was sufficient to induce subsequent lesions and necrosisformation. The ozone symptoms observed (Fig. 1) were inagreement with older reports (Hill et al., 1961; Oshima et al.,1978) classifying parsley as an ozone-sensitive plant on thebasis of growth and assimilate-partitioning measurements.The occurrence of callose and of fluorescent material duringlate symptom development provides a good analogy to ozoneeffects on tobacco leaves (Kerner, 1990; Schraudner et al.,1992). It is interesting that callose and fluorescent phenoliccompounds have also been described for necrotic develop-ment caused by Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea inparsley (Jahnen and Hahlbrock, 1988). The detection of fur-anocoumarins in the IWF was reminiscent of pathogen-infected parsley leaves, which secreted furanocoumarins intoinfection droplets (Tietjen et al., 1983; Scheel et al., 1986).Apiin has previously been reported to increase about 10-fold www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The present results revealed an approximate 2-fold increase of flavone glycosides as well as furanocoumarins after a standard ozone fumigation (200 nL L-'; 10 h). The ozone- induced accumulation of total flavone glycosides showed an early transient increase as well as a late secondary one. This induction pattem appeared to be due to a biosynthesis of flavone glycosides followed by metabolism or degradation and a renewed biosynthesis. This type of induction kinetics was also observed for enzyme activities and transcript amounts. The early increase in flavone glycosides can be compared to the UV response of intact parsley plants (Schmelzer et al., 1988). The later secondary increase ap- peared to be connected to complete necrosis development. The plants were kept under constant light to minimize diurna1 rhythms and stomatal limitations for ozone uptake. However, the constant light regime leads to the possibility that ozone merely increases the induction potential of the applied ir- radiance rather than being a direct inducer. A similar expla- nation could apply for the report concerning the 1.8-fold apiin induction by a jasmonate precursor in light-grown parsley cells (Dittrich et al., 1992). In the present study, there was a simultaneous induction of the furanocoumarins, which generally are not light in- duced (Hahlbrock and Scheel, 1989). The furanocoumarins showed high constitutive levels in healthy parsley plants. On this elevated background, the ozone-dependent 2-fold accu- mulation in total leaf extracts was highly significant. Previous attempts to demonstrate the induction of the furanocoumarin pathway in total leaf extracts after infection with P. megas- perma f .  sp. glycinea zoospores had failed (Knogge et al., 1987). An approximate 2-fold increase after ozone treatment was found for the total amount of furanocoumarins as well as for the individual components. On the basis of the time course of transcript accumulation, early, intermediate, and late stress genes could be defined. The three early genes for PR-1, PR-2, and Eli 16 were strongly induced at 3 h. The induction of intracellular PR proteins in parsley has also been described as one of the earliest effects after funga1 infection (Somssich et al., 1989). In addition, P- 1,3-glucanase, chitinase, and PR protein l b  have been shown to be ozone induced in tobacco (Emst et al., 1992b). POD and HRGP were determined to be late stress genes. These genes are known also to be induced by fungi and other stressors (Somssich et al., 1989; Sauer et al., 1990; Sutherland, 1991). In the phenylpropanoid pathway, ozone-induced tran- script accumulation preceded the increase of enzyme activity as well as product accumulation. In conclusion, a11 pathogen-responsive cDNA probes tested (PR-1, PR-2, Eli 16, PAL, 4CL, HRGP, POD) are shown here to be induced also by ozone treatment. However, ozone was an inducer that differed from the previous stressors in that the two distinct defensive pathways of parsley were induced simultaneously as shown in Figure 6. Ozone is thus termed a cross-inducer. In addition, parsley cDNA libraries have been constructed with poly(A)' RNA isolated from ozone- treated leaves. A number of ozone-induced, as well as ozone-  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

First, sequence analy- sis resulted in the identification of clones for PR 1-1, PR 1-3, and a small heat-shock protein (Emst et al., 1992a, and  our unpublished results). An ozone induction of defense reactions was observed previously in  pine, in which ozone treatment led to a n  increase of stilbene phytoalexins and  stilbene synthase in the needles (Rosemann et  al., 1991). Stilbenes are normally pres- ent  constitutively in heartwood and  are induced by fungi as phytoalexins in  pine softwood. In spruce, ozone led to the induction of polyamines (Sandermann et  al., 1990) and  CAD (Galliano et  al., 1993). Both responses are well-known plant defendive reactions. In tobacco, fungal and vira1 defense reactions (polyamines, ethylene, tyramine, stress proteins) were also induced by ozone (Sandermann et  al., 1989; Schraudner e t  al., 1992). Cross-induction of plant defense pathways by ozone may, therefore, be a fairly general phenomenon. A11 of these results lead to a number of scientific as well as  practical questions. For example, it has  to be  clarified how the signal chains for flavone glycoside and furanocoumarin induction can be activated at  the same time. How similar are the defense programs induced in plants by different stressors? It is interesting that induction of the two known defense pathways was not additive in cultured parsley cells upon simultaneous treatment with UV light and  elicitor, which completely blocked the light-induction of flavone glycosides (Lozoya et  al., 1991). Does the ozone induction of flavone glycosides and furanocoumarins occur in  their known histo- logical areas (epidermis and  oil ducts, respectively) or in  the areas of developing visible ozone lesions? A practical question is whether cross-induction of defensive pathways by ozone will also occur with crop plants and  weeds in the field. Recent experiments with tobacco have indeed shown that @-1,3- glucanase (Schraudner et al., 1992) and  ethylene metabolism (our unpublished results) react strongly to present ambient summer ozone concentrations. Changes in  disposition for plant diseases are, therefore, expected (Sandermann et al., 1989), but this important possibility remains to be examined in further experiments. ACKNOWLEDCMENTS We wish to thank Dr. C. Langebartels for valuable discussion and advice and Dr. D. Scheel, Max-Planck-Institut fiir Ziichtungsfor- schung, for his comments concerning the manuscript. Excellent tech- nical assistance was given by S .  Stich, E. Kiefer, and E. Mattes. The help of Dr. E. Back (Bundesamt fiir Umwelt, Wald und Landschaft, Beme, Switzerland) in the initial phase of this project is also acknowl- edged. Received June 1, 1993; accepted September 27, 1993.
