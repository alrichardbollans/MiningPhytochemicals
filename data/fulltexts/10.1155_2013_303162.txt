Plaunotol, an acyclic diterpenoid with highly effective antigastric ulcer properties, has been commercially isolated from leaves of
Croton stellatopilosus Ohba. This Thai medicinal plant was traditionally used in the form of crude extracts, suggesting that it is
possible to administer these plaunotol-containing extracts without toxicity. To confirm its safety, the oral toxicity of a partially
purified plaunotol extract (PPE) was evaluated in vivo. The PPE was simply prepared by 95% ethanol reflux extraction followed by
hexane partition. The obtained extract was analyzed and found to contain 43%w/w of plaunotol and another compound, likely a
fatty acid-plaunotol conjugate that is considered a major impurity. Oral administration of PPE to ICR mice and Wistar rats was
conducted to evaluate acute and chronic toxicity of the plaunotol extract, respectively. The acute toxicity study demonstrated that
PPE was practically nontoxic based on its high median lethal dose value (LD
50
= 10.25 g/kg). The chronic toxicity studies also
showed the absence of mortality and clinical symptoms in all rats treated with 11–1,100mg/kg/day of PPE during a 6-month period.
Histopathological and hematological analyses revealed that altered liver and kidney function and increased blood platelet number,
but only at the high doses (550–1,100mg/kg/day). These results suggest that PPE is potentially safe for further development as a
therapeutic agent in humans.
1. Introduction
Croton stellatopilosus Ohba, a Thai medicinal plant (Plau-
noi), has been acknowledged for its traditional remedy in the
treatment of helminthes and topical infection [1]. A major
constituent isolated from leaves of Plau-Noi is plaunotol [2].
This natural acyclic diterpene has been used as an antigastric
ulcer medication based on its pharmacotherapeutic effects
in inducing prostaglandin E
2
(PGE
2
) and eradicating Heli-
cobacter pylori bacteria [3–6]. However, in addition to its
application as a single compound that requires a complicated
process of extraction and purification [7], plaunotol used in
form of a partially purified plaunotol extract (PPE) is also of
interest.This is due to the wide distribution of Plau-Noi plant
inThailand [8] and the reliability of pharmacological benefits
of natural terpenoid provides in human healthcare [9, 10].
Furthermore, the use of PPE canminimize the cost of produc-
tion and increase the access to an effective drug at a low price.
At a dose of 240mg/day or 4.8mg/kg/day, plaunotol has
been recommended to achieve antigastric ulcer effects in
humans [11]. Because equivalent pharmacological activities
could potentially come from higher amounts of PPE than
those of pure plaunotol, it is necessary to assess toxicity pro-
files of such a high doses of PPE.Therefore, this study aims to
2 BioMed Research International
evaluate oral toxicity of PPE in order to generate a safety data
in animalmodels for extrapolation to human toxicity profiles.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Preparation of PPE. PPE was prepared from dried leaf
powder of Croton stellatopilosus Ohba by modifying a pre-
viously described method [7]. The leaf powder was refluxed
with 95% ethanol (1 : 1 ratio by weight) at 70∘C for 1 h. After
filtration, the extract was concentrated by using a rotary
evaporator, followed by partitioning with hexane (ratio of
1 : 1) to remove highly nonpolar constituents. With plaunotol
remaining in ethanol layer, the ethanol was evaporated in a
vacuum to obtain PPE, which was then collected and stored
at 4∘C. For use in this toxicity study, PPE was suspended in a
0.5% tragacanth solution and adjusted to various concentra-
tions as indicated.
2.2. Plaunotol Content Analysis. Quantitative analysis of pla-
unotol in PPE was conducted using the method of thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) reported previously [12, 13]. Briefly,
a silica gel 60 F
254
TLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
was spotted with PPE and standard plaunotol (obtained
from Thai Sankyo Co., Ltd., which is currently under Tipco
Biotech Co. Ltd., Prachuab Khiri Khan, Thailand). The plate
was then developed using a solvent system of chloroform:n-
propanol (96 : 4). The developed TLC plate was scanned by a
densitometer at 220 nm using a Camag TLC Scanner 3 with
Wincats software V 1.3.4 (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland).
Structural analysis of each constituent was carried out using
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS: Agilent
Model 6890N-5973N, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). A
DB-5 capillary column (30 × 0.25mm) with helium as a car-
rier gas at a flow rate of 13.8mL/min was heated from 150∘C
up to 300∘Cwith an increasing temperature rate of 15∘C/min.
Temperatures of both detector and the injector were set
at 250∘C [12]. Compound identification was performed by
comparing the resulting mass spectra with those available
in the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 7th edition
(McLafferty, 2000), Agilent Part no. G1035B.
2.3. Animals and Housing. All ICR (Imprinting Control Reg-
ion) mice and Wistar rats were obtained from the National
Laboratory Animal Center (Mahidol University, Nakorn
Pathom, Thailand). They were housed in the conventional
hygienic animal rooms of the Laboratory Animal Center,
Department of Medical Sciences, Nonthaburi, Thailand.
Room conditions were maintained at 25∘C, 60% humidity
and 12 hour-light-dark cycle. The animals were given a
commercial pellet diet 082 CP feed (Perfect Companion
Group, Thailand) and clean water ad libitum. Prior to the
experiment, the animals were allowed two weeks to acclimate
to the environment.
2.4. Acute Toxicity Study. Fivemale and five female ICRmice
were treated with either water for the control group or PPE at
2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/kg for each treatment group. All animals
were food restricted for 2 h prior to oral administration
of single doses of the substances. Observations of clinical
presentation andmortality were conducted at 15min, 30min,
3 h, 6 h, and 24 h following treatment and daily for 14 days
thereafter. Finally, the mean lethal dose value (LD
50
) was
calculated. This study was authorized by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, Department of Medical
Sciences as Permission no. 52-002.4.
2.5. Chronic Toxicity Study. Theprotocol used for the chronic
toxicity study was approved by the Institution of Animal
Care and Use Committee, Department of Medical Sciences
as Permission no. 53-014. Wistar rats were randomized into
six groups, each with 15 male and 15 female rats. Four
experimental groups were administered the PPE suspension
orally at doses of 11, 110, 550, and 1100mg/kg/day for six
months. Two control groups received distilled water and
0.5% tragacanth solution orally at the volume of 10mL/kg.
During the experimental period, animals were observed daily
for general appearance and signs of toxicity. Body weight
and food consumption were measured weekly. At the end
of the study, animals were fasted overnight and were then
killed using diethyl ether inhalation. Blood samples were
collected from the posterior vena cava for hematological and
biochemical value measurements.
Hematological analysis was performed using the hemato-
logical analyzer Cell Dyn 3500 (Abbot Laboratories Ltd., IL,
USA). The parameters examined included red blood cells
(RBC), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin, mean cell volume
(MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglo-
bin concentration (MCHC), white blood cells (WBC),
lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils,monocytes,
and platelets. Biochemical values weremeasured using Cobas
integra 400 (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland),
which assessed levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine
aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase
(AST), total protein, albumin, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), creatinine, glucose, uric acid, triglyceride, cholesterol
and sodium, potassium, and chloride ions.
A complete necropsy was performed to assess gross
lesions of visceral organs. Brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney,
stomach, spleen, testis, uterus, urinary bladder, and adrenal
glands were isolated and weighed using Mettler (Mettler
Toledo PB 153 balance, Mettler Toledo Intl. Inc., Zurich,
Switzerland). Relative organweight was calculated.The above
mentioned organs, including trachea, were fixed in 10%
phosphate-buffered formalin and subjected to conventional
histological processing and stained with hematoxylin for
further histopathological examination [14].
2.6. Statistical Analysis. A one-way ANOVA was used to
evaluate significant differences between groups via the Bon-
ferroni test. Fisher’s exact was applied to compare histopatho-
logical differences between groups. 𝑃 ≤ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

of plaunotol extraction and limited purification, PPE was
obtained in 2% yield (w/w) as a brownish-yellow translu-
cent oil. The extract appeared to contain plaunotol and an
unknown compound as the twomajor constituents and a few
minor impurities, as shown by the chemical profiles in the
TLC (Figure 1(a)) and GC (Figure 2(a)) chromatograms. The
UV absorption spectrum (Figure 1(b)) and mass spectrum
(Figure 2(b)) of the unknown compound were similar to
those of plaunotol, suggesting that themajor impurity in PPE
was a plaunotol-like compound. Because fatty acid conjugates
of plaunotol are known to be present in the leaves of C.
stellatopilosus [15], it is likely that the major impurity was one
of the fatty acid-plaunotol conjugates that were extractedwith
plaunotol. Quantitative analysis indicated that plaunotol was
present at approximately 43.0% w/w in the PPE preparation.
3.2. Acute Oral Toxicity and LD
50
. All of the observed PPE-
induced acute toxicity symptoms are summarized in Table 1.
The results were based on oral doses of PPE at 2.5, 5, 10, and
20 g/kg, calculated to be 200, 400, 800, and 1,600 times the
recommended dose of plaunotol for human therapeutic use,
respectively [11]. Acute diarrhea was detected early, 6 h after
extract administration, at all doses and remained until 72–
96 h. With the high doses of 10 and 20 g/kg, other clinical
symptoms were observed, including dyspnea (shortness of
breath), dullness, and stomach cramp.

Mortality was not observed in mice treated with water
(control) or PPE at 2.5 and 5 g/kg; however, it was observed
in four (one male and three females) and 10 (five males and
five females) mice between 24 and 72 h at the 10 and 20 g/kg
doses, respectively. Probit analysis revealed that the LD
50
of
PPE was 10.25 g/kg with 95% confidence limit between 7.37
and 14.63 g/kg.
3.3. Chronic Oral Toxicity
3.3.1. Effect of PPE on Body Weight, Food Consumption, and
Health Status. In this chronic toxicity study, rats were fed
equal volumes of PPE to minimize the effect of administra-
tion differences. PPEwas diluted in 0.5%w/w of tragacanth to
achieve the desirable concentrations used for gavage feeding
the rats. The selected concentrations of PPE were 11, 110, 550,
and 1,100mg/kg/day, which are equivalent to 1, 10, 50, and 100
times the therapeutic dose of plaunotol, respectively. Mortal-
ity and significant clinical symptoms were not observed in
any of the rats fed with PPE, water, and 0.5% w/w tragacanth
(Figure 3). It is important to note that, for male rats given
the high dose of PPE at 1,100mg/kg/day, a trend in altered
food consumption was not apparent even though there was
a significant decrease in body weight (Figure 4). Similarly,
the body weight and food consumption among female rats
showed no significant difference.
3.3.2. Effect of PPE on Relative OrganWeight Values. The val-
ues of relative organ weight, expressed as g/1000 g body
weight, are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. For male rats, rel-
ative organ weight values of the heart, liver, stomach, spleen,
and kidney were significantly increased at doses of 110, 550,
and 1,100mg/kg/day, comparedwith thewater and tragacanth
control groups (Table 2). Furthermore, relative weights of
the brain, lung, bladder, adrenal gland, and testis were also
higher in the male rats given 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day of PPE.
Table 3 summarizes the values of relative organ weight for
female rats. It can be seen that PPE treatment at high doses
(550 and 1,100mg/kg/day) caused an increase in the relative
weight of the liver and kidney compared to both control
groups. An additional organ that appeared to be affected in
the female group was the stomach, which showed signifi-
cantly higher relative weights in the 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day
PPE treatment groups.
3.3.3. Effect of PPE on Altered Hematological Values. After
feeding PPE at 11 and 110mg/kg/day for 6 months to both
male and female rats, no significant alterations in any of
the hematological values were observed (Tables 4 and 5). At
the high doses of 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day, male rats had
significantly higher platelet numbers but a lower percentage
of eosinophils compared to both controls. The hematocrit,
RBC, and hemoglobin valueswere significantly higher only in

was significantly lower.
The reduced value of %eosinophil was observed in female
rats administered 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day of PPE. These
two groups also appeared to have significantly higher values
of platelet numbers and percentage of basophil compared
to both controls. Moreover, the female rats treated with
1,100mg/kg/day had significantly lower MCV, MCH, and
MCHC compared to the controls, while the RBC and WBC
values were significantly higher.

3.3.4. Effect of PPE on Clinical Chemistry Values. An increase
in blood glucose levels was observed inmale rats treated with
PPE at 11 to 550mg/kg/day compared to the water control
group. Surprisingly, only the male rats fed 1,100mg/kg/day
showed lower blood glucose levels (Table 6), whereas the
female rats had higher blood glucose levels following treat-
ment with 110 to 1,100mg/kg/day of PPE, compared to the
tragacanth control group (Table 7).
Increased ALP values were observed in male rats that
received 110 to 1,100mg/kg/day and in female rats that
received the highest dose of 1,100mg/kg/day. Decreased AST
levels were observed only at the 550mg/kg/day dose in both
genders of rat. Total protein level was significantly increased
in the male rats receiving 11 and 550mg/kg/day, as well as
in female rats receiving 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day. Increased
albumin and BUN levels were observed in both male and
female rats given 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day of PPE compared
to both control groups.
The cholesterol values were significantly higher in both
male and female rats that received PPE at 550 and 1,100mg/
kg/day. In contrast, male rats treated with 1,100mg/kg/day of
the extracts had lower triglyceride levels compared to both
water and tragacanth control groups. Lower chloride levels
were observed in male rats given 110 and 550mg/kg/day and
female rats given 550 and 1,110mg/kg/day. High levels of uric
acidweremeasured inmale rats, but only at the doses of 11 and
550mg/kg/day. Female rats receiving PPE at 550mg/kg/day
showed a lower level of total bilirubin compared to both
control groups.
3.3.5. Histopathological Evaluation of PPE Treatment. For
all rats, remarkable macroscopic lesions were not observed
during the autopsy process. Histopathological evaluation also
indicated that remarkable lesions were not found in most
organs of the rats treated with PPE.Minor lesions were found
on specific organs, as summarized in Tables 8 and 9.
For male rats, the groups treated with 11, 110, and
550mg/kg/day of PPE showed significantly higher incidence
of cortical fat infiltration in the adrenal glands when com-
pared to the water control group. Only the group receiving
the highest dose of PPE showed a significant increase in bile
duct hyperplasia compared to both control groups. In the
female rats, hyperplasia of the mammary gland was found
in both control groups but not in the 11 and 110mg/kg/day
PPE-treated groups. The significant lesion in the kidney
was congested tubules in female rats given 1,100mg/kg/day.
Furthermore, dilated tubules were also observed in some of
the female rats receiving 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day of PPE.

of C. stellatopilosus. It was extracted by 95% ethanol under
reflux, followed by liquid-liquid partition with hexane to
remove nonpolar impurities. The major constituents of the
resulting ethanol extract of PPE appeared to be 43%w/w
of plaunotol with a similar amount of a plaunotol-like
compound, presumably a fatty acid-plaunotol conjugate.
Kitazawa et al. in 1982 reported on the presence of various
geranylgeraniol derivatives in the extracts of C. stellatopilo-
sus, including plaunotol (18-hydroxyl geranylgeraniol) and a
number of fatty acid esters of geranylgeraniol [15].
The PPE obtained from processing was expected to
be usable as a natural health product with its therapeutic
benefits similar to that of plaunotol. This acyclic diterpenoid,
originally found to possess antigastric ulcer activity, has con-
tinuously been reported to have bactericidal activity against
Helicobacter pylori and potential as an anticancer agent [5, 16–
18]. In this study, PPE was calculated to contain an equiv-
alent amount of plaunotol for antigastric ulcer treatment
in humans (4.8mg/kg/day), which is equivalent to a dose
of 11mg/kg/day of PPE [11]. Our results obtained from the
acute toxicity studies revealed that the tolerated dose of
PPE was approximately 2.5 g/kg, or 200-fold higher than the
recommended therapeutic dose. With this high dose, death
was not observed in ICRmice, butmild diarrhea was the only
observed side effect. In referring to toxicity classification, PPE
can be categorized as a practical, non-toxic agent [19], with an
LD
50
of 10.25 g/kg. This LD
50
value and the observed clinical
signs following PPE treatment were not different from the
data on pure plaunotol, which has previously been reported
to have LD
50
values of 8.8 and 8.1 g/kg for male and female
mice, respectively [16].
Based on the LD
50
of 10.25 g/kg, PPE was administered
by oral gavage at doses of 11, 110, 550, and 1,100mg/kg/day to
a total of 180 Wistar rats, male and female, for chronic oral
toxicity evaluation. Clinical and health status of the rats were
observed for 6 months during treatment. The results showed
that PPE did not suppress food consumption in all groups of
rats, although significant body weight loss was observed in
male rats treated with 1,100mg/kg/day. These results suggest
that the high concentration of acyclic diterpenoids in PPE
may increase the metabolic rate in male rats, as reported
previously [20]. However, this weight loss was only observed
in male rats, and not in females. The differential responses
may be gender dependent. In terms of organ weights, the
relative weights of most organs were increased due to PPE
treatment mainly in the male rats, whereas relative weights
of the liver, kidney, and stomach were increased in both male
and female rat groups. The latter may be due to responses
at the subcellular level, such as stimulation of proteins or
enzymes production [21]. Plaunotol exposure has been shown
to induce COX2 and PGE
2
expression in gastric epithelial
cells of rats [6]. Furthermore, the observed congestion of
blood in renal venules, as well as the dilated renal tubules,
may have affected the relative weight of kidneys in both male
and female rats.
The altered hematological values were not significantly
different from reference values for normal rats [21, 22], except
the increased platelet number in the highest dose-treated
group.The underlying mechanism for this observed increase
in platelet levels by plaunotol and the fatty acid-plaunotol
conjugate in PPE remains to be understood.
The significant increase in ALP levels caused by disorders
of the hepatobiliary duct and osteoblast activity has been
reported previously [23]. This response was observed in
male rats treated with PPE at 1,100mg/kg/day and in female
rats treated with PPE at 550 and 1,100mg/kg/day. Although
the geranylgeraniol compound has been reported to have
influence on osteoblast formation [24], abnormalities in bone
formation were not observed in any of the rats. Additionally,
the albumin values were increased male rats treated with 110
to 1,100mg/kg/day and female rats given 550 and 1,100mg/
kg/day. This may be due to the stimulation of insulin, growth
hormone, and corticosteroids [25]. The relationship between
the plaunotol extract and hormonal expression is still unclear
and requires further studies [26].
The values of AST, uric acid, and bilirubin were not
related to the administered concentrations of PPE, so these
alterations may not be due to the plaunotol extract. In con-
trast, the increase in BUN values in female rats treated with
550 and 1,100mg/kg/day may be the result of the high reab-
sorption of enlarged renal tubules.
Recently, Gutierrez et al. in 2011 demonstrated an inter-
esting effect of geranylgeraniol derivatives on blood glucose
levels in diabetic rats. Specifically, hyperglycemia was appar-
ent in rats treated with geranylgeranyl octadecanoate [20].
While the hydrophilic derivatives, such as geranylgeranyl
acetate, lower blood glucose levels [20], our present study
showed the hyperglycemic activity of PPE in male rats given
doses of 11 to 550mg/kg/day and in female rats treated with
110 to 1,100mg/kg/day. The lowered blood glucose was only
observed following treatment with 1,100mg/kg/day in male
rats.The varied effect on blood glucosemay be gender depen-
dent following treatment with the geranylgeraniol derivatives
including plaunotol and its fatty acid conjugate in PPE.
Although there were altered levels of chloride, potas-
sium, protein, and creatinine in the blood, these biochem-
ical values are still within the normal clinical ranges [22].
The increased cholesterol levels in female rats treated with
550 and 1,100mg/kg/day may be caused by the high dose of
PPE that was administered.The essential role geranylgeraniol
derivatives play in cholesterol synthesis has been reported
previously [27, 28].
It is known that, following oral administration, plaunotol
is metabolized via the liver and excreted through bile and
urine [11].Thus, large doses of PPEmay result in pathological
changes in liver and kidney cells. Histopathological evalu-
ation revealed apparent bile duct hyperplasia in both male
and female rats treated with 1,100mg/kg/day. Congestion and
dilation of renal tubules were observed at doses of 1,100mg/
kg/day of PPE in female rats. Incidence of fat accumulation in
the adrenal gland inmale rats andmammary gland hyperpla-
sia in female rats were not related to the concentration of PPE
and therefore may not be due to treatment with the extract.
5. Conclusion
This research demonstrated the safety of using PPE,
supporting the traditional use of plaunotol in the form of
BioMed Research International 11
crude extracts. It was apparent that PPE treatment at the
therapeutic dose did not induce any lethal pathological or
clinical signs following chronic exposure. Therefore, it may
be possible to develop this extract as a human healthcare
product. Nevertheless, administration of high doses of PPE
over a long period of time may cause deterioration of the
liver and renal tissue, including increased blood platelet
levels. Therefore, hematological and biochemical values
should be monitored during use of high doses of the extract
over a long period of time.
