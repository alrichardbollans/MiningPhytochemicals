The antileishmanial activity wastracked by HPLC-based activity profiling, and eight compounds were isolated from the chloroformfraction. These included lignans tetrahydrofuroguaiacin B (1), nectandrin B (2), furoguaiaoxidin(7), and 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,4′-dihydroxylignan-9-ol (10), and four cinnamoylphenethyl amides,namely dihydro-feruloyltyramine (5), (E)-N-feruloyltyramine (6), N,N′-diferuloylputrescine (8),and 7′-ethoxy-feruloyltyramine (9). The water fraction yielded steroid saponins 11–13. Compounds1, 2, and 5–13 are reported for the first time from Haplophyllum species and the familyRutaceae. The antiprotozoal activity of the compounds plus two stereoisomeric tetrahydrofuranlignans—fragransin B2 (3) and fragransin B1 (4)—was determined against Leishmania donovaniamastigotes, Plasmodium falciparum, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense bloodstream forms, along withtheir cytotoxicity to rat myoblast L6 cells. Nectandrin B (2) exhibited the highest activity againstL. donovani (IC50 4.5 µM) and the highest selectivity index (25.5).Keywords: HPLC-Activity profiling; Leishmania; Plasmodium; Trypanosoma; Haplophyllum tuberculatum;lignans; cinnamoylphenethyl amides; steroid saponins1. IntroductionNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infectious diseases that are prevalent intropical and sub-tropical developing countries. NTDs are strongly associated with poverty, and ofhigh socio-economic impact. NTDs account for 48 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and152,000 deaths per year [1,2]. The NTD leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania spp., imposes a globalburden of 3.3 million DALYS and 51,600 annual deaths [1,2]. There is no vaccine, and current drugsare problematic given their serious adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites [3].There is one efficient and safe drug, AmBisome, a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B [4]. However,Molecules 2020, 25, 2825; doi:10.3390/molecules25122825 www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2020, 25, 2825 2 of 15the high price of the drug and the need of an uninterrupted cold chain for delivery severely limits itsuse. In Eastern Africa, a high-burden region of visceral leishmaniasis [5], sodium stibogluconate is stillthe mainstay of leishmaniasis chemotherapy [3]. This pentavalent antimonial can cause hepatotoxicityand cardiotoxicity [6]. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new, efficacious, safe,and cost-effective drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis and other diseases caused by kinetoplastidparasites [7,8].A library of Sudanese medicinal plants traditionally used as anti-infectives was screened forantiprotozoal activity against Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma cruzi,and Plasmodium falciparum. One of the most promising hits was Haplophyllum tuberculatum (Forssk.) A.Juss. (Rutaceae). Chloroform and aqueous fractions obtained by partitioning of an ethanolic extractfrom roots of the plant were active against L. donovani and P. falciparum (>85% growth inhibition at10 µg/mL) [9].Haplophyllum tuberculatum is a perennial herb distributed throughout North Africa and theMiddle East. In Sudan, the plant is locally known as Haza, and the aerial parts have been usedtraditionally to treat malaria, asthma, kidney diseases, gynecological and bowel disorders [10,11].Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activities have been reported [10–12],and alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins and lignans have been identified [13–15]. The methanolic extractof the aerial part and roots of H. tuberculatum possessed activity against P. falciparum [16], and JusticidinA was found active [17]. The essential oil from the leaves had antileishmanial activity [18]. Justicidin B,a lignan isolated from the leaves, showed trypanocidal activity [19].The aim of this project was a systematic evaluation of the antiparasitic activities of H. tuberculatumand the identification of the bioactive compounds by means of HPLC-based activity profiling.2. Results and Discussion2.1. Extraction and HPLC-based Activity ProfilingThe chloroform and the water fractions from roots of H. tuberculatum had been previously found tobe active against L. donovani when tested at 10 µg/mL [9]. The antileishmanial activity was tracked byHPLC-based activity profiling, a procedure combining time-based microfractionation with bioactivitytesting [20]. One-minute microfractions were collected and tested for growth inhibition of L. donovaniaxenic amastigotes. The HPLC-ESIMS traces (base peak chromatograms in positive ion mode) overlaidwith the antileishmanial activity of microfractions are shown for the chloroform (Figure 1) and thewater fraction (Figure 2). Pronounced antileishmanial activity (>50% growth inhibition) was foundin the chloroform fraction in the time window of 16–21 min, and moderate activity (30–40% growthinhibition) in the window of 12–15 min. For the water fraction, the antileishmanial activity wasconfined to a narrow time window between 19–20 min.Molecules 2020, 25, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 16  stibogluconate is still the mainstay of leishmaniasis chemotherapy [3].

Compound Isolation and Structure Elucidation Preparative separation by MPLC of the chloroform fraction on a C18 cartridge yielded 13 subfractions (A-M). HPLC-PDA-MS analysis showed that subfractions B and C contained peaks from the active time window. Further purification by semipreparative RP-HPLC afforded compounds 1 and 2 from subfraction B. Based on NMR data (Table S1, Supporting Information), the two compounds were identified as the known lignans tetrahydrofuroguaiacin B (1) and nectandrin B (2) (Figure 3) [21–23]. Semipreparative RP-HPLC of subfraction C afforded compounds 5–10. By means of 1D and 2D NMR data (Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information), these were identified as four cinnamoylphenethyl amides, namely dihydro-feruloyltyramine (5) [24], (E)-N-feruloyltyramine (6) [25], N,N′-diferuloylputrescine (8) [26], and 7′-ethoxy-feruloyltyramine (9) [27], and two lignans, furoguaiaoxidin (7) [23] and 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,4′-dihydroxylignan-9-ol (10) [28] (Figure 3). Compounds 9 and 10 showed optical rotation close to zero, and no cotton effects in the ECD spectra (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). From a comparison with published data for the two compounds, we conclude that they mostly likely were racemic mixtures.  Figure 2.

Preparative RP chromatography by MPLC of the water fraction on a C18 cartridge yielded 15 subfractions (A-O), whereby subfractions J and K contained the peaks from the active time window of the activity profile (Figure 2). Semipreparative HPLC on a Hilic column afforded inseparable mixtures of 11 and 12 from subfraction J, and 11 and 13 from subfraction K. The HRESIMS spectrum of 11 exhibited a sodium adduct ion (m/z 1039.5083 [M + Na]+, calcd for C50H80O21Na+ 1039.5085) indicative of a molecular formula of C50H80O21. The NMR data (Table S4, Supporting Information) pointed to a steroidal saponin consisting of aglycon and four sugars. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts with literature data identified the aglycon as yamogenin [29]. This was corroborated by a detailed analysis of the 2D NMR spectra, in particular by cross peaks in the ROESY spectrum between H-1β (δH 1.78), H3-19 (δH 0.94), H-8 (δH 1.54), H3-18 (δH 0.72), and H-20 (δH 1.75), between H-1α (δH 0.96) and H-3 (δH 3.46), and between H3-21 (δH 0.92), H-17 (δH 1.65), H-16 (δH 4.27) and H-14 (δH 1.07). After hydrolysis and derivatization the sugars were identified as ᴅ -glucose, ʟ -rhamnose, and ᴅ -xylose [30]. The interglycosidic linkages and the attachment position of the sugar chain at the aglycon were established by HMBC correlations (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information) from δH 4.43 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1-Glc1) to δc 76.9 (C-3), from δH 5.04 (1H, br s, H-1-Rha1) to δc 76.4 (C-2-Glc1), from δH 4.34 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1-Glc2) to δc 81.1 (C-4-Glc1), and from δH 4.38 (1H, d, J = 7.1 Hz, H-1-Xyl) to δc 86.4 (C-3-Glc2). saponin 11 was identified as (3S,20S,22R,25S)-spirost-5-en-3-yl-(β-ᴅ-i re 3.

As for compound 11, NMR data (Table S4,Supporting Information) indicated yamogenin bearing four sugars. The only differencewas in the presence of a rhamnopyranose instead of a xylopyranose (Figures S3 andS4, Supporting Information).

Amide 7 has been previously reported from Guaiacumofficinale [23], while compound 8 has been found in Tribulus terrestris [46], Peltophorum pterocarpum [47],and Zea mays [48]. Amide 10 has been previously identified in Schisandra bicolor var. tuberculata [28].Saponins 11–13 have been previously isolated, together with a series of similarcompounds, as molluscicidal saponins from the Sudanese medicinal plant Balanites aegyptiaca(Zygophyllaceae) [31,32,49]. It can be assumed that saponins 11–13 contributed to the molluscicidalactivity that has been described for H. tuberculatum [50].To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1, 2, and 5–13 have been isolated here for the first timenot only from Haplophyllum species but also from plants of the Rutaceae family.2.4. Biological TestingCompounds 1–10 were tested for their in vitro activities against the following protozoan parasites:Leishmania donovani (MHOM/ET/67/L82) axenic amastigotes, Plasmodium falciparum (NF54) proliferativeerythrocytic stages, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (STIB 900) bloodstream forms (Table 1). In parallel,cytotoxicity of these compounds in rat skeletal myoblasts (L-6 cells) was determined in order to obtainan initial assessment of their selectivity. The results are reported in Table 1. Subfractions J and Kfrom the aqueous fraction containing steroidal saponins 11 and 12 in J, and 11 and 13 in K, exhibitedIC50 < 8 µg/mL across all parasites and a selectivity index <2, indicative of general cytotoxicity.Table 1.

Activity against Leishmania Donovani Axenic AmastigotesNectandrin B (2) was the most active (IC50 of 5 µM) and the most selective (SI 26) of allcompounds tested. This finding contrasts with a previous report on nectandrin B being inactive againstL. donovani [51]. The discrepancy may come from the fact that, in the aforementioned study, nectandrinB was tested against the promastigote form of the parasite (i.e., the proliferative form in the gut ofthe sandfly vector) while we tested against the amastigote form (i.e., the proliferative form in themammalian host). The antileishmanial activity cannot be ascribed to any particular mode of actionat this point. In general, some tetrahydrofuran lignans have been reported to inhibit trypanothioneMolecules 2020, 25, 2825 7 of 15reductase [52], an enzyme of a thiol-redox system that is unique to trypanosomatid protozoa andessential for their survival [53,54]. Compared to 2, tetrahydrofuroguaiacin B (1) was less active andmore toxic. The two compounds only differ in their stereochemistry at the tetrahydrofuran ring,which therefore appears to play a crucial role in the antileishmanial activity of such lignans. To betterunderstand the role of the stereochemistry at the central ring and the contribution of substituents at thearomatic rings, structurally related lignans 3 and 4 that had been previously reported from Myristicafragrans Houtt. [21,22] were also included in the testing.However, both compounds were significantly less active than nectrandrin B (2). Unfortunately,the activity of nectandrin B (2) against L. donovani was lost in the intracellular amastigote assay testedup to a concentration of 30 µM.2.4.2. Activity against Plasmodium FalciparumLignans 2 and 10 were the most active and least toxic compounds (IC50 9–9.5 µM, SI 12–14).Compound 10 was selectively active against P. falciparum. Compared to 2, fragransin B1 (4) (IC50 17 µM,SI 8), was less active against P. falciparum, but was slightly more active and less cytotoxic than itsstereoisomer fragransin B2 (3). Amides 8 (IC50 30.6 µM, SI 4.8), and 9 (IC50 30.4 µM, SI 6.8) showedcomparable activity, while the congener 5 was the least active among all tested compounds.A wide spectrum of biological activities of cinnamoylphenethyl amides has been described,including antiproliferative [55], antibacterial [56], antifungal [57] and antioxidant activities [58]. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first report of antileishmanial and antiplasmodial activities ofsuch compounds.2.4.3. Activity against Trypanosoma Brucei RhodesienseOf all compounds tested, diferuloylputrescine (8) exhibited the highest activity againstT. b. rhodesiense and the highest selectivity (IC50 19 µM, SI 8). The lignan 10 showed a lower activity andselectivity index (IC50 28 µM and SI 5), while 5 and 6 were the least active among all tested compounds.None of the tetrahydrofuran lignans 1–4 exhibited significant activity against T. b. rhodesiense.3. Materials and Methods3.1. General Experimental ProceduresHPLC grade solvents from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and Macron Fine Chemicals(Avantor Performance Materials, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA), and ultrapure water from a Milli-Q waterpurification system (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for HPLC separations.For extraction and preparative separation, technical grade solvents (Scharlab S. L., Barcelona, Spain)were used after distillation. Silica gel 60 F254 coated aluminum TLC plates were obtained from Merck(Darmstadt, Germany).Optical rotation was measured in methanol on a JASCO P-2000 digital polarimeter (Tokyo, Japan)equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and a temperature-controlled microcell (10 cm). UV andECD spectra were recorded in methanol on a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics,Leatherhead, UK) using 110 QS 1 mm path precision cells (Hellma Analytics, Müllheim, Germany).NMR spectra of compounds 1, 2, and 5–10 were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer(Billerica, CA, USA) operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C. 1H, COSY, HSQC, HMBC,and NOESY spectra were measured at 23 ◦C in a 1-mm TXI probe with a z-gradient. The sample volumewas 10 µL. NMR spectra of 11–13 were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 600 MHz spectrometeroperating at 600.18 MHz for 1H and 150.92 MHz for 13C with an inverse 1.7 mm TCI micro-cryoprobe(30 µL sample volume) at 23 ◦C. This cryogenically cooled probe delivered a 4-fold gain of masssensitivity over the 1 mm TXI room-temperature probe and enabled the NMR analysis of small sampleamounts (µg range), usually obtained for natural products. Spectra were analyzed by Bruker TopSpinMolecules 2020, 25, 2825 8 of 153.5 pl 7 and ACDLabs Spectrus Processor. NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 99.9 atom%D(Armar Chemicals, Döttingen, Switzerland).HRESIMS data were measured in the positive ion mode on an Orbitrap LQT XL mass spectrometer(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). HPLC-PDA-ELSD-ESIMS data were recorded in positive-and negative-ion mode (scan range of m/z 200−1500) on a Shimadzu LC-MS/MS 8030 triple quadrupoleMS system (Kyoto, Japan) connected via a T-splitter (1:10) to a photo diode array detector (PDA)(SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) (3300, Alltech,Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland). For data acquisition and processing, LabSolutions software (Kyoto, Japan)was used.Separations were performed on a C18 SunFire column (3.0 × 150 mm i. d., 3.5 µm) equipped witha precolumn (10 × 3.0 mm i. d.) (Waters).Microfractionation was carried out with the same HPLC instrument connected via a T split toan FC204 fraction collector (Gilson, Mettmenstetten, Switzerland) with only UV detection, using aSunFire C18 (3.5 µm, 150 × 3.0 mm i.d.) column equipped with a guard column (10 × 3.0 mm i.d.)(Waters). Semipreparative HPLC were performed on an Agilent 1100 system (Santa Clara, CA, USA)with PDA detector. A SunFire C18 column (5 µm, 10 × 150 mm i. d.) fitted with a guard column(10 × 10 mm i.d.) (Waters) and a Nucleodur Hilic column (5 µm, 10 × 150 mm i. d.) (Macherey-Nagel),were used for separations. ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies) was used for data acquisitionand processing. Preparative HPLC was carried out on a PuriFlash 4100 system (Interchim, Montluçon,France). Separations were performed on RediSep Rf Gold ®-C18 MPLC cartridge 100g (Teledyne Isco).3.2. Plant MaterialRoots of Haplophyllum tuberculatum were collected in February 2018 in Khartoum, Sudan.The taxonomic identity was confirmed by the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Institute,Sudan. A voucher specimen (HTR 02) is deposited at the Herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy,University of Science and Technology, Omdurman, Sudan. The plant material was dried at roomtemperature and milled with a hammer mill before extraction.3.3. ExtractionThe powdered roots of H. tuberculatum (300 g) were extracted with 1 L of 70% ethanol under stirringfor 24 h. The extract was filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and concentrated in a rotaryevaporator to obtain 35.7 g of extract. The extract amount was suspended in water and partitionedconsecutively with petroleum ether, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. Three repetitive partitioningprocedures, each with 500 mL of either solvent, were performed. In total, 0.4 g of petroleum etherfraction, 4.0 g of chloroform fraction, 2.0 g of ethyl acetate fraction, and 16.4 g of the water fractionwere obtained after evaporation.3.4. Microfractionation for Activity ProfilingHPLC-based microfractionation of the chloroform and the water fractions was performed[H2O + 0.1% formic acid (A), CH3CN + 0.1% formic acid (B); 0→100% B (0–30 min), 100% B (30–40 min);flow rate 0.4 mL/min; sample concentration 10 mg/mL in DMSO; injection volume 2 × 35 µL] bycollecting one-minute fractions from minute 1 to 40 into a 96-deep-well plate. Plates were then dried ina Genevac EZ-2 evaporator (Ipswich, UK) and prepared for antiprotozoal activity testing based onpreviously established protocols [20,59].3.5. Preparative IsolationThe chloroform fraction was reconstituted in DMSO and separated on a RediSep Rf Gold ® RP-C18,100 gm cartridge [H2O (A), CH3CN (B); 5→100% B (0–120 min), flow rate 20 mL/min]. A total of13 subfractions (A-M) were combined based on TLC patterns. The subfractions were analyzed byHPLC-PDA-MS to track peaks previously detected in the active time windows of the activity profile.Molecules 2020, 25, 2825 9 of 15Subfraction B (247 mg) was submitted to semipreparative HPLC on a C18 column [H2O (A),CH3CN (B); 56% B (0–35 min), 56→100% B (35–40 min), 100% B (40–45 min), flow rate 4 mL/min;sample concentration 50 mg/mL in DMSO; injection volume 50 µL; detection at 208 nm] to affordtetrahydrofuroguaiacin B (1, 2.2 mg, tR 22.3 min) and nectandrin B (2, 1.9 mg, tR 29.5 min).A portion (200 mg) of subfraction C was separated by semipreparative HPLC on a C18 column[H2O (A), MeOH (B); 39→48% B (0–30 min), 48→100% B (30–40 min), 100% B (40–45 min), flow rate4 mL/min; sample concentration 50 mg/mL in DMSO; injection volume 50 µL; detection at 254nm], and dihydro-feruloyltyramine (5, 2.5 mg, tR 9.4 min), (E)-N-feruloyltyramine (6, 10.6 mg,tR 16.2 min), furoguaiaoxidin (7, 1.4 mg, tR 16.2 min), N,N′-diferuloylputrescine (8, 1.4 mg, tR 23.4 min),7′-ethoxy-trans-feruloyltyramine (9, 1.1 mg, tR 27.3 min), and 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,4′-dihydroxylignan-9-ol(10, 2.5 mg, tR 36.5 min) were obtained.For the water fraction, an aliquot (8 g) was re-dissolved in water and separated by preparativeHPLC on a RediSep Rf Gold ® RP-C18, 100 gm cartridge [H2O (A), CH3CN (B); 20→65% B (0–120 min),65→100% B (120–135 min), flow flow rate 20 mL/min]. Fractions with similar TLC patterns werecombined to yield 15 subfractions (A-O). HPLC-PDA-MS analysis located the peaks detected in theactive time window in subfractions J and K. Subfraction J (17 mg) was submitted to semipreparativeHPLC on a C18 column (H2O (A), CH3CN (B); 41% B (0–40 min), 41→100% B (40–45 min), 100% B(45–50 min), flow rate 4 mL/min; sample concentration 50 mg/mL in DMSO; injection volume 50 µL;detection at 193 nm) to afford compounds 11 and 12 as a mixture (2 mg, tR 22.3 min).Subfraction K (53 mg) was submitted to semipreparative HPLC on a C18 column (H2O (A),CH3CN (B); 40% B (0–40 min), 40→100% B (40–45 min), 100% B (45–50 min), flow rate 4 mL/min;sample concentration 50 mg/mL in DMSO; injection volume 50 µL; detection at 193 nm), yieldingsubfraction K3.

Activity against Leishmania Donovani Axenic AmastigotesAmastigotes of L. donovani strain MHOM/ET/67/L82 were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 inair in axenic culture at 37 ◦C in SM medium [60] at pH 5.4 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetalbovine serum. Next, 50 µL of culture medium was added in the wells of a 96-well plate and serial drugdilutions of eleven 3-fold dilution steps covering a final range from 100 to 0.002 µg/mL were prepared.Then, 50 µL of culture medium with 2 × 105 amastigotes from axenic culture were added to each well.The plates were incubated for 70 h and then inspected under an inverted microscope to assure growth ofthe controls and sterile conditions. 10 µL of resazurin (12.5 mg resazurin dissolved in 100 mL distilledwater) were added to each well of the plates and allowed for additional 2 h incubation. Afterwards,plates were read with a Spectramax Gemini XS microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices Cooperation,Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 536 nm and an emission wavelength of 588 nm.Data were analyzed using the software Softmax Pro (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale,CA, USA). Decrease of fluorescence (=inhibition) was expressed as percentage of the fluorescence ofuntreated control cultures and plotted against the drug concentrations. From the sigmoidal inhibitioncurves the IC50 values were calculated by linear regression using Microsoft Excel. Miltefosine was usedas positive control drug. Assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.3.7. Activity against Leishmania Donovani Intramacrophage AmastigotesMouse peritoneal macrophages (4 × 104 in 100 µL RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivatedFBS) were seeded into wells of a 96-well plate. After 24 h, 100 µL of 2 × 105 amastigote Leishmaniadonovani were added. The amastigotes were taken from an axenic amastigote culture grown at pH 5.4.The medium containing free amastigote forms was removed after 24 h and replaced with fresh medium.The washing step was repeated and afterwards the serial drug dilution was prepared with at least6 dilution steps. Compound was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/mL and further diluted in medium.After incubation for 96 h at 37 ◦C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere, the medium was removed and cells werefixed by adding 50 µL 4% formaldehyde solution followed by a staining with a 5 µM DRAQ5 solution.Plates were imaged in ImageXpress XLS (MD) microscope using a 20× air objective (635 nm excitation:690/50 emission). Nine images were collected per well. Automated image analysis was performedwith a script developed on Meta Xpress Software (MD). Three outputs were provided for each well:(i) number of host cell nuclei; (ii) numbers of infected and non-infected host cells; (iii) number ofparasite nuclei per infected host cell. The IC50 values were calculated based on the infection rate andthe numbers of intracellular amastigotes. Miltefosine was used as control. Assays were performed intwo independent replicates at least.3.8. Activity against Plasmodium FalciparumIn vitro activity against the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum was determined using a3H-hypoxanthine incorporation assay [61], using the drug-sensitive NF54 strain [62]. Compoundswere dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/mL and further diluted in medium before addition to parasitecultures incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without hypoxanthine, supplemented with HEPES (5.94 g/L),NaHCO3 (2.1 g/L), neomycin (100 U/mL), AlbumaxR (5 g/L) and washed human red cells A+ at 2.5%Molecules 2020, 25, 2825 11 of 15haematocrit (0.3% parasitaemia). Serial drug dilutions of eleven 3-fold dilution steps covering a rangefrom 100 to 0.002 µg/mL were prepared. The 96-well plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphereat 37 ◦C; 4% CO2, 3% O2, 93% N2. After 48 h 50 µL of 3H-hypoxanthine (=0.5 µCi) was added to eachwell of the plate. The plates were incubated for a further 24 h under the same conditions. The plateswere then harvested with a Betaplate™ cell harvester (Wallac, Zurich, Switzerland), and the red bloodcells transferred onto a glass fibre filter then lysed with distilled water. The dried filters were insertedinto a plastic foil with 10 mL of scintillation fluid, and counted in a Betaplate™ liquid scintillationcounter (Wallac, Zurich, Switzerland). IC50 values were calculated from sigmoidal inhibition curvesby linear regression using Microsoft Excel. Chloroquine (Sigma C6628) was used as positive control.Assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.3.9. Activity against Trypanosoma Brucei RhodesienseThe stock was originally isolated from a Tanzanian patient and adapted to axenic culture conditionsafter several mouse passages and cloned. Minimum Essential Medium (50 µL) supplemented with25 mM HEPES, 1 g/L additional glucose, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (100×), 0.2 mM2-mercaptoethanol, 1mM Na-pyruvate [63] and 15% heat inactivated horse serum was added to eachwell of a 96-well microtiter plate. Serial drug dilutions of eleven 3-fold dilution steps covering a rangefrom 100 to 0.002 µg/mL were prepared. Then 4 × 103 bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense STIB900 in 50 µL were added to each well and the plate incubated at 37 ◦C under a 5% CO2 atmospherefor 70 h. 10 µL resazurin solution (resazurin, 12.5 mg in 100 mL double-distilled water) was thenadded to each well and incubation continued for a further 2–4 h [64]. Then the plates were read with aSpectramax Gemini XS microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)using an excitation wavelength of 536 nm and an emission wavelength of 588 nm. Data were analyzedwith the graphic programme Softmax Pro (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA),which calculated IC50 values by linear regression [65], and 4-parameter logistic regression from thesigmoidal dose inhibition curves using Microsoft Excel. Melarsoprol (Arsobal Sanofi-Aventis, receivedfrom WHO) was used as control. Assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.3.10. In Vitro Cytotoxicity with L-6 CellsAssays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates, each well containing 100 µL of RPMI 1640medium supplemented with 1% l-glutamine (200 mM) and 10% fetal bovine serum, and 4000 L-6cells (a primary cell line derived from rat skeletal myoblasts) [66]. Serial drug dilutions of eleven3-fold dilution steps covering a range from 100 to 0.002 µg/mL were prepared 24 h post seeding L-6cells. After 70 h of incubation the plates were inspected under an inverted microscope to assuregrowth of the controls and sterile conditions. 10 µL of resazurin was then added to each well and theplates incubated for another 2 h. Then the plates were read with a Spectramax Gemini XS microplatefluorometer (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of536 nm and an emission wavelength of 588 nm. The IC50 values were calculated by linear regressionand 4-parameter logistic regression from the sigmoidal dose inhibition curves using SoftmaxProsoftware (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and Microsoft Excel. Podophyllotoxin(Sigma P4405) was used as control. All assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.4. ConclusionsIn total, eleven compounds (1, 2, and 5–13) have been reported here for the first time fromHaplophyllum species and the Rutaceae family. It is interesting to note that, to the best of our knowledge,this is the first report on the presence of the saponin class in the respective plant species and family.The antiprotozoal activity of these compounds, plus the two stereoisomeric tetrahydrofuran lignansfragransin B2 (3) and fragransin B1 (4), was determined against L. donovani amastigotes, P. falciparum,and T. b. rhodesiense bloodstream forms, along with their cytotoxicity to rat myoblast L6 cells. NectandrinB (2) exhibited the highest activity against L. donovani axenic amastigotes (IC50 4.5 µM) and the highestMolecules 2020, 25, 2825 12 of 15selectivity index (SI 25.5). The lignan 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,4′-dihydroxylignan-9-ol (10) was the mostactive against P. falciparum (IC50 9.3 µM; SI 13.7). The steroidal saponins (11–13) showed activity withIC50 < 8 µg/mL across all parasites; however, they were the least selective (SI < 2). The promisingactivity of nectandrin B against axenic L. donovani amastigotes was not reproduced when tested againstintracellular amastigotes, possibly due to lack of penetration or stability of nectandrin B in macrophages.Nevertheless, the specific antileishmanial activity of nectandrin B could serve as the starting point forthe identification of a new antileishmanial drug target.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/12/2825/s1,Figure S1: UV (A) and ECD (B) spectra for compound 9 in MeOH (0.07 mg/mL), Figure S2: UV (A) and ECD (B)spectra for compound 10 in MeOH (0.05 mg/mL), Figure S3: HSQC-DEPT spectrum of the mixture of compounds11 (in red and black) and 12 (in blue and black) (500 MHz, DMSO), Figure S4: HMBC spectrum of the mixtureof compounds 11 and 12 (500 MHz, DMSO), Figure S5: HSQC-DEPT spectrum of the mixture of compounds 11and 13 (labelled in red, a prime was added for signals differing from 11) (500 MHz, DMSO), Figure S6: HMBCspectrum of the mixture of compounds 11 and 13 (500 MHz, DMSO), Table S1: 1H and 13C NMR SpectroscopicData for Compounds 1 and 2 (DMSO-d6; 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 for 13C NMR; δ in ppm), Table S2: 1H and13C NMR Spectroscopic Data for Compounds 5–8 (DMSO-d6; 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 for 13C NMR; δ inppm), Table S3: 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopic Data for Compounds 9 and 10 (DMSO-d6; 500.13 MHz for 1H and125.77 for 13C NMR; δ in ppm), Table S4: 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopic Data for Compounds 11–13 (DMSO-d6;600.18 MHz for 1H and 125.77 for 13C NMR; δ in ppm).Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.B.M., O.D., M.K., S.K., P.M. and M.H.; methodology, M.K., S.K.,P.M. and M.H.; formal analysis, A.B.M., O.D. and S.H.; investigation, A.B.M., O.D., M.K., S.H., A.M., S.A.A. andW.K.O.; resources, W.K.O., A.M., P.M and M.H; writing—original draft preparation, A.B.M., O.D., M.K. and A.M.;writing—review and editing, A.B.M., O.D., M.K., S.H., W.K.O., A.M., S.A.A., S.K., P.M. and M.H.; supervision,P.M., M.H. and S.K.; funding acquisition, P.M.
