Three new neoclerodane diterpenoids, divinatorins A-C (7-9), have been isolated from the leaves of
Salvia divinorum. The compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods as derivatives of the antibiotic
(-)-hardwickiic acid (10), which was also isolated, along with four other known terpenoids. Neither the
crude extract nor 7-9 displayed antimicrobial activity.
Salvia divinorum Epling & Ja´tiva (Lamiaceae) is a sage
used medicinally by the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca,
Mexico. The leaves contain salvinorin A (1),1 a potent
hallucinogen acting at the kappa opioid receptor.2 Recently,
the plant has gained notoriety as a legal hallucinogen, sold
openly on the Internet. As a result, the plant and compound
1 have been prohibited in Australia3 (a recent bill to
prohibit the plant in the United States was not enacted).4
The enforcement of such controls is likely to be hampered
by the plant’s nondescript appearance and the very limited
chemical data available.5 Until recently, only four com-
pounds had been isolated from this species: salvinorins A
(1), B (2),6 and C (3)7 and loliolide.8 GC/MS analysis also
indicated the possible presence of neophytadiene and
stigmasterol.5
Recently we reported the isolation of salvinorins D-F
(4-6) from the acetone extract of commercial S. divi-
norum,9 employing chromatography on activated carbon to
separate the terpenoids from complicating pigments. This
work generated several mixed fractions, which appeared
initially to be inseparable. Exhaustive chromatography on
silica gel, employing high silica ratios and diverse solvent
systems, has now yielded divinatorins A-C (7-9), along
with the known terpenoids (-)-hardwickiic acid (10)10 and
oleanolic acid (11).11
In addition, an extraction of locally grown leaves was
undertaken. The acetone extract was again chromato-
graphed on activated carbon; elution with EtOAc/petrol
gave partial separation of two terpenoid fractions. The first,
after chromatography on silica gel, yielded the known
terpenoids presqualene alcohol (12),12 peplusol (13),13 and
(E)-phytol (14).14 The second mixture was recrystallized
from MeOH to give 1, albeit in much lower yield than from
the commercial material (0.56 g/kg).
The structures of 7-9 were elucidated chiefly by NMR
(1H,13C, DEPT, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY in each
case). The 1H NMR spectra suggested that they were
derivatives of 10. The molecular formula of 7, C20H28O4
(HRESIMS), implied the presence of a single hydroxyl
substituent, which was confirmed by an IR absorption at
3392 cm-1. This was located at C-1 on the basis of 2D
NMR: the oxymethine at ä 4.49 showed couplings to H-2
and -10 (COSY) and C-3, -9, and -10 (HMBC). The config-
uration was confirmed by an H-1 to H-11 cross-peak in the
NOESY spectrum.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 8 suggested a methyl ester (ä
3.71) with two hydroxyl groups [ä 1.49 (2H, D2O-exchange-
able)]. A strong IR absorption band occurred at 3434 cm-1.
The molecular formula, C21H30O5 (HRESIMS), was con-
sistent with this proposal. One of the hydroxyl groups was
again located at C-1, showing the same couplings as in 7.
The second was located at C-17, on the basis of the
couplings of the oxymethylene signals (ä 3.38 and 3.84) to
H-8 (COSY) and to C-7, -8, and -9 (HMBC). The NOESY

spectrum showed H-1 to H-11 and H-17 to H-20 cross-
peaks, confirming the configuration at these centers.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 9 showed an acetyl methyl
signal (ä 2.03). The oxymethylene signals, shifted downfield
to ä 3.79 and 4.26, showed the same couplings as in 8,
establishing the 17-acetoxy structure shown. This was con-
sistent with the molecular formula, C22H30O5 (HRESIMS).
The expected relative stereochemistry of compounds 7-9
was confirmed in each case by NOESY cross-peaks from
H-20 to H-17 and -19 (setting C-5, -8, and -9), and H-10 to
H-12 (setting C-10). The absolute stereochemistry shown
is common to all clerodanes isolated from the Lamiaceae,15
including 116 and 10.17
Since compound 10 has previously been shown to display
potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity,10 7-9 were
screened against standard antibiotic-susceptible strains of
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis,
and Candida albicans, using standard microdilution18,19
and disk diffusion20 assays. Compounds 7-9 showed no
activity against any of the test organisms at 100 íg/mL or
100 íg/disk. These data extend the remarkably stringent
structure-activity requirements of 10.10 To probe this
further, we decided to screen (+)-hardwickiic acid (ent-10).
This was isolated from copaiba balsam as the methyl
ester.21 Hydrolysis proved challenging: reflux in KOH/
MeOH gave only slow decomposition, but microwave ir-
radiation on KF/Al2O322 provided ent-10 in low yield. ent-
10 proved active against S. aureus (MIC 25 íg/mL) and B.
subtilis (MIC 12.5 íg/mL, 10 mm zone of inhibition), but
much less potent than its enantiomer (MIC 0.78 íg/mL
against B. subtilis).10
A previous non-peer-reviewed investigation23 reported
the acetone extract of S. divinorum to be active against a
wide range of bacteria. We were unable to confirm these
results. The acetone extract of the commercial material,
as well as 1, showed no activity at 100 íg/mL or 100 íg/
disk. Probably insufficient 10 and 11 were present to elicit
an effect (11, like 10, is active against B. subtilis and S.
aureus).24
Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures. Instruments and
materials were as described previously.9 Flash column chro-
matography was performed on Merck silica gel 60. Silica:solute
mass ratios up to 400:1 were used for difficult separations (¢Rf
< 0.05). Vacuum chromatography was performed on Merck
activated carbon 2183. ‘Petrol’ refers to the petroleum ether
fraction boiling at 40-60 °C.
Plant Materials. S. divinorum plants, cultivated in Mel-
bourne, were harvested in February 2003. A voucher specimen
was deposited at the National Herbarium of Victoria (accession
number MEL 2145478). Copaiba balsam was donated by
Australian Botanical Products (Hallam, Victoria).
Antimicrobial Tests. The crude extract and pure com-
pounds were tested against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC
6633), and Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) using standard
broth microdilution18,19 (100-0.19 íg/mL using 2-fold serial
dilutions) and disc-diffusion20 assays (100 íg/disk). All meas-
urements were performed in duplicate. Streptomycin sulfate
and amphotericin B were used as positive controls.
Extraction and Isolation. Dried commercial S. divinorum
leaves (860 g) were extracted as described previously.9 The
mother liquor from recrystallization of 1 was subjected to flash
column chromatography (FCC) on silica gel in a 5-50%
acetone/CH2Cl2 gradient. This was divided based on TLC (10%
acetone/CH2Cl2) into four series: A (656 mg), B (150 mg), C
(359 mg), and D (77 mg).
Series A: 90 mg was subjected to FCC, eluting with a
gradient from 50 to 80% Et2O/petrol, to give 10 (6 mg).
Series C: trituration in Et2O gave 4 (75 mg). FCC of the
mother liquor (60-100% Et2O/petrol) gave four fractions based
on TLC (70% Et2O/petrol): C1 (55 mg), C2 (119 mg), C3 (57
mg), and C4 (26 mg)
Fraction C1: repeated FCC (20% acetone/petrol and 40-
60% Et2O/petrol) gave 9 (23 mg) and 11 (3 mg).
Fraction C2: repeated FCC (25% acetone/petrol and 60-
100% Et2O/petrol) gave 8 (32 mg).
Fraction C3: extensive FCC (Et2O/petrol, acetone/petrol,
and EtOAc/petrol) gave additional 8 (total yield 41 mg) and a
mixture of 5 and 6, which were separated as described
previously.9
Fraction C4 gave pure 4 (total yield 114 mg).

Series D: repeated FCC (60% Et2O/petrol and 4% MeOH/

Extraction of Australian Material. Dried, powdered
Australian-grown S. divinorum leaves (224 g) were steeped
in acetone for 30 min (3  250 mL). Filtration and evaporation
under reduced pressure gave a dark green tar (7 g). This was
purified by vacuum column chromatography on a mixture of
activated carbon (75 g) and diatomite filter aid (1:1), eluting
with a gradient from 50 to 20% EtOAc/petrol, to give series E
(97 mg) and F (279 mg) based on TLC (70% Et2O/petrol).
Series E: repeated FCC (1% acetone/CH2Cl2 and 20% Et2O/
petrol) gave 13 (6 mg). Further FCC (0.75% MeOH/CH2Cl2 and
1% EtOH/CHCl3) gave 12 (23 mg) and 14 (12 mg).
Series F: two recrystallizations from MeOH gave 1 (126
mg).
