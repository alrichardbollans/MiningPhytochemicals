Nesta comunicação estamos reportando as propriedades tóxicas dos extratos metanólicos das
flores, pedúnculos, folhas, pecíolo e casca do tronco de Dimorphandra mollis sobre as operárias de
Apis mellifera. Astilbina (3-β-O-rhamnosideo de 5,7,3’,4’– tetraidroxi-2,3-diidroflavonol) isolada
dos pedúnculos e flores como o seu principal componente, apresentou atividade inseticida sobre
abelhas confinadas. Os resultados obtidos indicam que a astilbina reduz a sobrevivência média das
abelhas tratadas.
In this communication we have evaluated the toxic properties of methanol extracts from flowers,
peduncles, leaves, petioles and stem bark of Dimorphandra mollis to Apis mellifera workers.
Astilbin (5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy–2,3-dihydroflavonol-3-β-O-rhamnoside) has been isolated from
peduncles and flowers of this plant in large amounts. Astilbin presented insecticidal activity against
confined bees. The results suggest that astilbin reduces the average survival of treated bees.
Keywords: flavonoids, natural insecticides, Dimorphandra mollis, Apis mellifera
Introduction
Dimorphandra mollis Benth. (Fabaceae,
Caesalpinioideae)1 is a very common tree that occurs from
south to west in Brazil. There are no references about the
occurrence of this species in other parts of the world. Two
plant species have been popularly known as “barbatimão”:
Stryphnodendron adstringens (true “barbatimão”) and
Dimorphandra mollis (false “barbatimão”).1 In spite of
belonging to different genera, both species are sympatric
(similar blooming period), from September to January, and
the pollen of Stryphnodendron polyphyllum has been
reported to be toxic to bees.2
Considering that while plants produce substances
attractive to bees, they need to protect other parts, as well
as flower bud, generally the place where bees collect
substances to make propolis, from herbivore attack. This
defense is commonly made by repellents, deterrents or even
by toxic chemical compounds.3
Field observations by Brazilian beekeepers revealed
that D. mollis is toxic to bees during blooming season.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of the
compounds isolated from flowers, peduncles, leaves,
petioles and stem bark of D. mollis against workers of A.
mellifera.
Results and Discussion
Dichloromethane and methanol extracts of flowers,
peduncles, leaves, petioles and stem bark, were prepared
(Table 1) and tested in toxic bioassays against bees,
applying a sucrose and honey diet of 30 mg per bee,

containing 1.0, 0.5 and. 0.2 % of these extracts or pure
astilbin. Bioassays with dichloromethane and methanol
extracts from leaves and petioles showed no activity. The
methanol extracts of flowers, part of the plant highly visited
by the bees, and also the extracts of peduncles and stem
bark were actives (Figure 1, Table 2). After twelve days for
the high concentrated flowers and peduncles extracts
tested all the bees died, while in the control the workers
died after 22-25 days. The methanol extract from the stem
bark showed to be active, killing all the bees within 8
days. The toxic bioassays were accomplished by Log Rank
test4 and all active test had p< 0.0001.
From the methanol extracts of peduncles and flowers,
astilbin (1) was isolated (crystallization from methanol/
hexane, 1:1) as a major component (its concentration is
higher than 99 % in this extract), while the methanol
extracts of the stem bark afforded mixture of astilbin, as
the major constituent (60.6 %), neoisoastilbin (2, 16.6 %)
and catechin (3, 9.0 %). These compounds were identified
by comparison of their spectral data with those in the
literature for astilbin,5 neoisoastilbin5 and catechin.6, 7

The lethality bioassay to the bees with astilbin showed
the same activity as that of the peduncles methanol extract
containing 99.9 % of 1 (Figure 1, Table 2). Surprisingly
the stem bark methanol extract was highly active (Figure
1, Table 2), therefore separate bioassays with neoisoastilbin
and catechin will be necessary to confirm the activity of
each component of the mixture and if there is a synergism
between them, and to determine whether 2 or 3 is more
active than 1. However, since astilbin is the major
component in all active extracts analyzed, it could be
responsible for the main observed activity of D. mollis
against workers of A. mellifera.
Previous work with Lonchocarpus speciosus extracts,
containing astilbin in mixture with others flavonoids,
showed insecticidal effects against Drosophila
melonogaster flies.8 Astilbin exhibits a variety of other
biological activities such as reducing total liver cholesterol
concentration,9 protecting against oxidative damage to
liver mitochondria and hemolysis erytrocytes,10 inhibiting
lens aldose reductase to prevent cataract formation in
diabetes,11 enhancement of the vanadate-stimulated release
of lipoprotein lipase activity,12 and hepatoprotective effect
in rats13 and mices.14
Experimental
Plant material
The flower peduncles (161 g), petioles (220 g), leaves
(650 g), stems bark (600 g) and flowers (450 g) of D. mollis
were collected in Rio Claro, São Paulo state Brazil, in
February of 1999. These parts were dried separately in a
stove with air circulation (40 oC) and milled in a Willey
mill type.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents
The extraction of the plant material was performed with
dichloromethane (3 times) followed by methanol (2 times).
The amount of solvent used each time in the extraction of
the dry material were 0,5 L for peduncles and petioles;
1,0 L for flowers and 1,5 L for leaves and stem bark.
Catechin (17.1 mg) and the mixture of astilbin and
neoisoastilbin (160.5 mg) were separated by preparative
flash chromatography from part of methanol extract of stem
bark (190 mg). The mixture of astilbin and neoisoastilbin
(25 mg) was submitted to recycling HPLC separation on a
polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310
P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm L) eluted with MeOH (Flow rate:
7 mL min-1 UV detector at 290 nm) yielding astilbin
(18 mg), neoisoastilbin (5 mg), after five cycles of 30 min.
Biological assay
Africanized bees Apis mellifera were collected at the
UNESP- Rio Claro apiary. Newly emerged bees were
identified on the basis of their color and collected. All
bees used for the experiments had the same age.
The extracts or astilbin were incorporated in small
percentages (0.2 %, 0.5 % and 1 %) to the bees artificial
diet. The diet consisted of sucrose and honey (5:1) and
was given as such to the control group. The diet was offered
to sixty bees divided into three groups of twenty bees
confined in small cages (11 cm X 11 cm X 7 cm). For a
higher survival average the bees were confined in groups
of twenty.15 The control group received just the diet and
water daily. The experiments were performed during 25
days, at 32 ºC, in a BOD apparatus and the number of dead
bees was registered.
The daily survival rates for each treatment was
calculated and the survival curves were traced using the
Software Graphpad Prism 2.01. The non-parametric test of
Log Rank4 was applied a posteriori, to compare each
treatment with the control group.
