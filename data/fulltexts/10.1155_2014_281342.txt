The alkaloids in the processed Rhizoma Corydalis and the crude Rhizoma Corydalis were qualitatively and semiquantitatively
analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The processing herb drug procedure was carried out
according to the standard method of Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The samples were extracted using Soxhlet extractor with different
solvents: methanol and acetone. The extraction effect on different solvents was investigated. The results showed that 11 kinds of
alkaloids were identified from the crude Rhizoma Corydalis and only two were from the processed Rhizoma Corydalis. A total
of 13 kinds of alkaloids were all based on two backbones. The alkaloids in the processed sample were less than those in the crude
Rhizoma Corydalis significantly, while almost the corydaline has been changed in conformation after the sample had undergone
processing, which provided support for the conclusion of reducing toxicity when the herbal medicine having been undergone a
traditional drugs treatment process.
1. Introduction
Rhizoma Corydalis (RC), belonging to Corydalis species and
the family of Papaveraceae, is a perennial herbaceous plant
and grows mostly in Northeastern China. The tubers of RC
have been employed as analgesic, sedative, and hypnagogue
for long times [1, 2], which is a well-known traditional
Chinese herbal medicine,Corydalis yanhusuoW.T.Wang and
acts againstmyocardial ischemia, gastric ulcer, and tumour in
themedical field.The bioactive constituents, corydaline, have
analgesic efficacy but little toxicity [3–6].
The crude RC were used as samples in all phytochemical
analysis, but the RC as traditional Chinese medicine often
underwent processing. There is an old saying in China: “As
a medicine, it is somewhat toxic,” so the folk pharmacists
always make the natural herbal medicine a processing hand-
craft to enhance efficiency and reduce toxicity. It has been
reported that more than 20 kinds of alkaloids are identified
in RC [7–9], which have the similar biosynthetic route and
backbone to berberine [10, 11]. These alkaloids are formed
from two molecules of tyrosine. The tyrosines bioassemble
the benzylisoquinolines, while the more immediate, pose the
berberine basic structure [12]. The characteristics of these
alkaloids are higher boiling points and lower vapor pres-
sures. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) [13–15], high performance
capillary electrophoresis (HPLE) [16], and supercritical fluid
chromatography [17] were often employed in the analysis
of these alkaloids. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (LC/MS) and multistage spectrometry (MS𝑛) were also
reported in some literatures [18–20]. However, identified
alkaloids are uneasy using LC/MS due to no available mass
spectral database on electrospray ionization (ESI). GC/MS is
one of the highest sensitivity analysis techniques, whose limit
of detection can easily reach picogram (10−12) and provide
available standard mass spectral data library [21–23].
In this paper, the processed RC was employed as sample
to investigate whether the alkaloids content and composition
were changed. The crude RC was processed according to
the standard method of Chinese Pharmacopoeia compiled
by Pharmacopoeia Commission of Ministry of the Health
of China as processed RC sample [24]. The processed RC

samples were extracted in Soxhlet extractor with methanol,
and the crude RC sample, as control, was extracted with two
different solvents, methanol and acetone. A comparison of
the differences and similarities between the processed RC
and the crude RC on the alkaloids was performed for both
qualitative and semiquantitative analyses.
2. Experiment
2.1. Reagents. The plant materials were provided from Tra-
ditional Chinese Medicine Institute of Heibei University
and authenticated by pharmacist Xianmao Liang. A voucher
specimen has been deposited in our laboratory. The chem-
icals purchased from a local chemical company (Hua Xin,
Baoding, China) were of analytical reagent grade and
includedmethanol (MeOH), acetone (Ac), dichloromethane,
and sodium hydroxide. Acetic acid and hydrochloric acid
(12mol/L) were also purchased from the local chemical
company. The water used in the experiments was doubly
distilled and prepared in our laboratory.
2.2. Processing RC and Extraction. The processed RC was
carried out according to the method described in Chinese
Pharmacopoeia. Briefly, 10 g of RC was immersed in a
beaker (50mL) with acetic acid solution (30mL, 36%). The
solutionwas heated until dryness.Then the processed RCwas
extracted in Soxhlet extractor with 150mL of MeOH/H

solution (12mol/L). The mixture (60mL) was refluxed for
1 h and extracted with dichloromethane (20mL × 3) in a
separatory funnel to be degreased after cooling to room
temperature. The degreased solution (60mL) was filtered
after adjusting the pH to 8 with NaOH. The filtrate (60mL)
was extractedwith dichloromethane (20mL× 3).The organic
phase was collected in a conical flask. 10mL of the organic
phase was transferred to a tube (10mL) and evaporated to
dryness under a N

stream. The residue was dissolved with
1.0mL of acetone, marked S1, and then stored in −20∘C for
further GC/MS analysis.
The extractions of the crude RC with methanol and
acetonewere the same as described above except that the drug
had not undergone processing. The methanol and acetone
extracts of RCweremarked S2 and S3, respectively, and stored
in −20∘C for further GC/MS analysis.

The numbers of alkaloids (𝑋#) were consistent with those in Table 1.
2.3. GC/MS Analysis. GC/MS was performed on an Agilent
7890A GC Plus equipped with an 5975C mass/selective
detector (Agilent Technologies). A fuse silica capillary col-
umn, HP-5-MS, with 5%-phenyl methylpolysiloxane as no-
polar stationary phase (30m × 0.25mm i.d. × 0.25mm film
thickness, Agilent Technologies) was utilized for analysis of
alkaloids obtained from the processed RC and the crude
RC. The injection port temperature was 260∘C. The column
temperature programme started at 40∘C upon injection. The
temperature was increased at a rate of 40∘C/min to 110∘C and
then at a rate of 8∘C/min to 260∘C and held there for 10min.
Purified helium gas at a flow rate of 1mL/min was used as the
GC carrier gas in constant flow fashion. Each sample (1𝜇L)
was injected into the column using a 60 : 1 split injection
and solvent delay time was 3min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode with an
electron energy of 70 eV; ion source temperature, 230∘C;
quadrupole temperature, 150∘C; mass range, m/z 38–550;
scan rate, 0.25 s/scan; EM voltage, 1423V; and the GC/MS
transfer line was set to 280∘C.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Chromatographic Separation. The processed RC sample
was claybank via extraction in Soxhlet extractor and the
crude RC samples were faint yellow. An important feature
is the cleanup of samples prior to GC/MS analysis because
the presence of matrix interference leads to ion suppression
or enhancement in many cases [25, 26]. After degreasing,
alkaloids were enriched and most micromolecules were
wiped off.
Figure 1 was the chromatograms of three samples after
19min. The chromatographic distillate components before
19min (not shown in Figure 1) are the constituents with low
boiling point like alkane, ester, alcohol, ketone, and fatty
acid, which are the residual in the degreased process. The
alkaloids, however, with higher boiling points and lower
vapor pressures were eluted after 19min. As Figure 1 showed,
the components of S1 eluted after 19min are less than those of
S2 and S3 obviously.
More than ten peaks were eluted after 19min from the
crude samples S2 and S3. The retention times of the peaks
were the same but the heights of peaks were not equal due
to the different concentration between S2 and S3, whereas
there were only a few peaks eluted from S1. The processed
sample S1 had obvious differences to the crude samples S2 and
S3, which indicated that the constituents with high boiling
point eluted after 19min were related more to the processing
of the sample rather than to the extraction solvent, which led
to content changes and chemical rearrangements of alkaloid
components.
3.2. Identification of Alkaloids. The identifications of the
alkaloid components were based on computer matching of
their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those stored
in the spectrometer database using the National Institute of
Standards and Technology Mass Spectral Database (NIST-
MS, 2008) and artificial interpreting of their fragmentation
patterns. Table 1 showed that a total of 13 kinds of alkaloids
including corydaline, glaucine, canadine, and protopine were
identified from the crude and processed RC samples. They
have two backbone structures to constitute two series of
alkaloids (Figure 2). Among them, there were two chro-
matographic peaks (retention times 20.288 and 28.257) with
extremely similar mass spectral fragmentation, hence with
the same searching result.The latter peak (28.257)with higher
match degree was identified as the search result Isoquino
[2.1-b] isoquinoline, 4b,5,10,10a,11,12-hexahydro-2-hydroxy-
3,8,9-trismethoxy-, and the former peak was identified as
isomer of the latter.
There was no matching with corydaline in Mass Spec-
tral Database (NIST-MS, 2008). The mass spectral data of
corydaline were mostly carried out using ESI model due to
the poor volatilization of corydaline. With rare fragment ion,
the ESI mass spectrum was not equipped with mass spectral
database. Hence, ESI mass spectral data was not identified
through mass spectral library search. Fortunately, Rueffer
et al. [12] had performed the study to probe into a biosynthesis
path of these alkaloids using C13 markers, in which themass
spectrum ofthalictricavine, very similar to corydaline, was
provided using EI model (Figure 3(a)). It indicated that the
based fragment ion was m/z 178 (base peak) which was
cleaved from piperidine (Figure 3(b)). Figure 4 was the mass
spectrum (EI) of chromatographic peak P
4
(26.426) and P
5
(26.485). As Figure 4 showed that the base peak of mass
spectrum for both P
4
and P
5
is m/z 178 and the second base
peaks are different, P
4
is m/z 355, not the molecule ion, and
P
5
is m/z 369, the molecule ion. The compound of P4 was
identified as corydaline according to the research by Rueffer
et al. [12]. And the P
5
was identified as conformational isomer
of corydaline. This outcome was backed not only by mass
spectral data but also by the retention time. The difference of
retention time between two peaks was about 3.6 s. It indicated
that conformational change happened with corydaline when
theRCwas processed.A simple acid bath ofRCwas capable of
the conformation conversion of corydaline, which illustrated
that the threshold battery of conformation conversion for

corydaline was low; and the traditional processing herbal
medicine procedure was efficient in reducing their toxicity.
3.3. Effect of Different Solvents on Extraction of Alkaloid.
Although GC/MS total ion chromatograms (after 19min) of
crude CR samples S2 and S3 were similar to each other, the
relative content of component was different. Table 2 was the
relative contents of alkaloids in the crude RC samples S2
and S3. The contents of eluted alkaloids in S2 were higher
than those in S3 except 4, 6, and 11# peaks. It suggested
that extraction solvent was dependent on the target alkaloids.
The most relative content component in S2 and S3 was
10# peak, which was not fully separated and contained two
components. It indicated that the chromatographic behavior
of these components was very similar. The different oven
programs were performed to improve their separation, but
the outcome was not as expected.
4. Conclusion
The crude RC and processed RC were qualitatively and
semiquantitatively analyzed using gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The totals of 13 kinds of
alkaloids were identified, in which 11 kinds of alkaloids
were from the crude RC sample and two were from the
processed RC sample. The 13 kinds of alkaloids are all from
two backbone structures forming two series of alkaloids. The
extraction of alkaloids was related a little to the solvent used.
Most of the alkaloids in crude RC were not detected and
the corydaline had been changed in conformation after the
RC had undergone processing, which provided support for

the conclusion of reducing toxicity in the traditional drugs
