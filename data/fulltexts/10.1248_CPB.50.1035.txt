Saprosma scortechinii BL. KING & GAMBLE, a rubiaceousplant endemic in the Malay Peninsula,1) is also known as‘sekentut’, a local name associated with the unpleasant andfetid odor emitted by the bruised plant tissues. In the tradi-tional medicinal system of Malaysia, the roots are employedin decoctions to treat fever by the native communities, whilethe young leaves are also eaten as a vegetable.2) Our previousstudies on the plant have resulted in the isolation of six sul-fur-containing bis-iridoid glucosides (saprosmosides A—F)and 13 iridoid glucosides.3) On-going studies on the sameplant materials have resulted in the isolation of two new bis-iridoid glucosides, a new iridoid glucoside, and seven newanthraquinones, in addition to three known compounds. Wewish to report herein the isolation and structural elucidationof these compounds.Results and DiscussionDried leaves and stems were separately extracted withmethanol, and the resulting extracts were subjected to sol-vent–solvent partitioning. A combination of column chro-matography followed by further purification led to the isola-tion of two new bis-iridoid glucosides (1 and 2) and a newiridoid glucoside (3) from the leaves, and seven new an-thraquinones (4—10) from the stems, in addition to threeknown compounds identified as 6-O-acetylscandoside,4)lucidin 3-O-b-primeveroside,5) and damnacanthol 3-O-b-primeveroside.6)The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1) of compound 1showed two sets of almost superimposable signals (16 car-bons each), including signals from two glucopyranosyl moi-eties attributable to two iridoid glucoside units, indicatingthat 1 was a bis-iridoid glucoside. The [M1H]1 ion peak(m/z 763) in the positive-ion FAB-MS supported this obser-vation and the molecular mass was consistent with a molecu-lar formula of C32H42O21. The UV (235 nm) and IR (1696,1635 cm21) spectra were characteristic for an iridoidic enolether system conjugated with a carbonyl group.7,8) The pro-ton and carbon signals of the two units closely resembledAugust 2002 Chem.

Received February 18, 2002; accepted May 8, 2002A further investigation of the leaves and stems of Saprosma scortechinii afforded 13 compounds, of which 10are new compounds. These were elucidated as the bis-iridoid glucosides, saprosmosides G (1) and H (2), the iri-doid glucoside, 6-O-epi-acetylscandoside (3), and the anthraquinones, 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone (4), 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b-primeveroside (5), 1,3-dihydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b-primeveroside (6), 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (7), 1-methoxy-3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (8), 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b-primeveroside (9), and 3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-an-thraquinone (10). Structure assignments for all compounds were established by means of mass and NMR spec-troscopies, chemical methods, and comparison with published data. The new anthraquinones were derivatives ofmunjistin and lucidin.Key words Saprosma scortechinii; Rubiaceae; bis-iridoid glucoside; sulfur-containing iridoid; anthraquinonethose of deacetylasperulosidic acid (1a),3) and alkaline treat-ment of 1 afforded deacetylasperulosidic acid. This observa-tion confirmed that compound 1 is an ester dimer of deacety-lasperulosidic acid. The position of the linkage between thetwo units was determined by comparing the 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of 1 with those of deacetylasperulo-sidic acid.3) The upfield shift of the carbonyl carbon signal (d168.9) of one unit (unit a), and the downfield shifts of thecarbon and proton signals of C-69 [dC 64.1, dH 4.24 (dd,J512.0, 5.5 Hz), 4.47 (dd, J512.0, 2.0 Hz)] of the other unit(unit b), indicated that the two identical units were connectedthrough an ester bond between C-11 of unit a and C-69 ofunit b. This linkage was further confirmed by the heteronu-clear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) correlations be-tween the protons of C-69 of unit b and the carbonyl carbonof unit a. On the basis of the above data, the structure of thebis-iridoid was deduced to be as shown as 1 and designatedas saprosmoside G.Compound 2, named saprosmoside H, was shown to havethe molecular formula C34H42O21S as evidenced by positive-ion high resolution (HR)-FAB-MS and the 13C-NMR spectraldata. The functional groups of OH, C5O, and C5C were in-dicated by the IR absorptions at 3390, 1704, and 1656 cm21,respectively. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1) dis-played two sets of signals typical of a dimeric iridoid gluco-side. One set of signals (unit a) showed similar chemicalshifts as those of compound 1, except for signals arisingfrom a methyl (dC 13.6, dH 2.35, s) and a carbonyl (dC 172.9)group, the chemical shifts of which suggested the presenceof a thiocarbonyl function.9) In the HMBC spectrum, themethyl proton signal (d 2.35) was correlated with the car-bonyl carbon (d 172.9), and in turn was correlated with theC-10 methylene protons, which therefore supported the loca-tion of the thiocarbonyl function at C-10. The other iridoidunit (unit b) of the molecule demonstrated downfield shifts ofthe carbon (d 86.4) and proton (d 5.51, m) signals at C-6,and HMBC correlation between H-6 and the carbonyl carbonat C-11. These spectral characteristics strongly suggestedthat unit b was deacetylasperuloside.3) Alkaline hydrolysis of2 generated deacetylasperulosidic acid and the characteristicodor of thiomethanol, which further supported the presenceof the thiocarbonyl function and the identity of the two sub-units. The C-29 position of unit b was deduced to be the siteof esterification with C-11 of unit a, on the basis of the up-field shift of the C-11 carbonyl carbon (d 167.5) of unit a,and the downfield shift of C-29 proton (d 4.79, dd, J59.0,8.0 Hz) of unit b, as well as the existence of HMBC correla-tion between H-29 of unit b and C-11 of unit a. The structurewas further substantiated by comparing the spectra of 2 withthose of saprosmoside E,3) one of the series of bis-iridoidsisolated previously from the same plant, which was made upof the subunits paederosidic acid (unit a) and paederoside(unit b) esterified at C-29 of unit b and C-11 of unit a. Ac-cordingly, saprosmoside H was assigned the structure of 2.Compound 3 has the molecular formula C18H24O12, as de-termined by positive-ion FAB-MS in combination with the1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data. The UV (229 nm) andIR (1712 and 1633 cm21) spectra indicated the presence of aconjugated enol-ether system of an iridoid.7,8) The 1H-NMRspectrum was characterized by a doublet for the C-1 proton(d 5.28, J56.0 Hz), a doublet for the C-3 proton (d 7.43,J51.0 Hz), two doublets for the C-10 oxy-methylene (d 4.19,4.35, J515.5 Hz), a doublet for the anomeric proton of glu-cose (d 4.67, J58.0 Hz) and a singlet for an acetoxyl group(d 2.02). These spectral data were almost superimposable onthose of 6-O-acetylscandoside.10) 1H–1H correlation spec-troscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence(HSQC), and HMBC analyses of the NMR signals enabledcomplete assignment of the planar structure of 3 to be thesame as 6-O-acetylscandoside.

This observa-tion indicated that the 6-acetoxyl group in 3 was oriented inan a configuration instead of the b configuration as in 6-O-acetylscandoside.11,12) These data were also in agreementwith the previously isolated C-6 epimers, paederosidic acid(6a-OH) and 6-epi-paederosidic acid (6b-OH),3) and asperu-losidic acid (6a-OH) and 10-acetylscandoside (6b-OH),3)where the 6a-OH epimers consistently displayed downfieldshifts of the C-1 and C-3 carbon signals, and upfield shifts ofthe C-4 and C-11 carbon signals compared to those of their6b-OH epimers. Compound 3 was therefore deduced as the6a epimer of 6-O-acetylscandoside, and characterized as 6-O-epi-acetylscandoside.Compounds 4—10 were obtained as yellow-orange pow-ders which showed UV and IR absorption spectra character-istics of anthraquinone.13) Compound 4 was assigned themolecular formula C17H12O6 based on HR-electron impact(EI)-MS (m/z 312.0629 for [M]1, Calcd 312.0634) and 13C-NMR spectral data. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Tables 2,3) of 4 resembled those of munjistin 1-O-methyl ether,14)showing an AA9BB9 type of aromatic proton signals at d7.87—8.17, an isolated aromatic proton signal at d 7.56,along with signals for one aromatic methoxyl group, and anaromatic hydroxyl group. However, compound 4 showed thepresence of a methyl ester, as revealed by HMBC correlationof the methoxyl proton signal at d 3.86 to the ester carbonyl(d 164.9). 1H–1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC (Fig. 1) experi-ments led to the assignment of the structure as shown in 4.Additionally, the ion peak at m/z 280 suggested the loss of aneutral molecule of CH3OH, facilitated by the formation of asix membered transition state with the ortho disposition ofthe carbomethoxy and hydroxy substituents.15) Accordingly,compound 4 was deduced to be 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-car-bomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone.The positive-ion FAB-MS of 5 revealed the [M12H]1peak at m/z 608, characteristic of quinones due to the genera-tion of a hydroquinone entity,16) and was compatible with themolecular formula of C28H30O15. Other fragment ion peaks atm/z 594 [M12H214]1, 476 [M12H2132]1, 314 [M12H21322162]1 indicated the respective elimination of onemethyl, one pentosyl and one hexosyl moiety. The 1H- and13C-NMR spectral data (Tables 2, 3) of 5 were almost super-imposable on those of 4, except for the presence of additionalsignals due to two glycosyl units in 5, evidenced by two diax-ial coupled anomeric protons [d 5.22 (d, J57.5 Hz), 4.13 (d,J57.5 Hz)]. Acid hydrolysis of 5 and HPLC analysis of thesugar fraction established the identity of the glycosyl units asglucose and xylose. The anomeric proton signal (d 5.22) ofthe glucose was correlated with C-3 of the anthraquinonemoiety, which established the 3-O-b-glucosidic linkage. Thesignal attributable to C-69 of the glucosyl unit was shifteddownfield (d 68.0), and correlated with H-10 of the xylosemoiety in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, the C-10 of the termi-nal xylosyl unit should be linked to the C-69 of the glucosylpart through a b-glycosidic linkage. These assignments werein agreement with those published for the sugar moieties oflucidin 3-O-b-primeveroside and damnacanthol 3-O-b-primeveroside.5,6) Therefore, the identity of 5 was establishedas 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone3-O-b-primeveroside.Compound 6 had a very similar structure to 5 includingthe primeverosyl moiety. The differences shown in the NMRspectra (Tables 2, 3) were the absence of an aromaticmethoxyl group and the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl pro-ton signal at d 12.80, as well as a chelated carbonyl carbon atd 186.8 in 6 (IR, 1639 cm21),17,18) which indicated that themethoxyl group at C-1 in compound 5 was replaced by a hy-droxyl group in compound 6. This assignment was in agree-ment with the molecular formula of C27H28O15. On the basisof these data, compound 6 was characterized as 1,3-dihy-droxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b-primevero-side.Compound 7 exhibited the molecular formula C16H12O6(FAB-MS, m/z 301 [M1H]1). The 1H-NMR spectrum (Table2) showed three aromatic protons of an ABX pattern charac-teristic of a monosubstituted A-ring [d 7.42 (d, J52.5 Hz),7.20 (dd, J58.5, 2.5 Hz), 8.04 (d, J58.5 Hz)], a proton sin-glet (d 7.19) of a trisubstituted C-ring, one three-proton sin-glet for a methoxyl group (d 3.27), one two-proton singlet at-tributed to an oxy-methylene (d 4.42), and three hydroxylprotons, the chemical shift of one (d 13.41) suggested a perihydroxyl group. The 13C-NMR data (Table 3) indicated threearomatic hydroxyl-substituted carbons (d 163.1, 163.4,163.5), while the presence of unchelated and chelated car-August 2002 1037Fig. 1. Principal HMBC Correlations (H→C) of Compounds 4, 7, 8 and 10bonyl carbons (d 181.8, 185.5) was supported by the IR ab-sorptions at 1662 and 1630 cm21, respectively.17,18) The iso-lated proton (d 7.19) was assigned to the C-4 position on thebasis of its chemical shift and HMBC spectral analysis (Fig.1). Similarly, the assignments of the hydroxyl groups at C-1,C-3, and C-6 were confirmed by the observed two- or three-bond correlations in the HMBC spectrum. AdditionalHMBC correlations of the methoxyl signal (d 3.27) to themethylene carbon (d 61.1), and of the methylene proton tothe carbons at C-1, C-2, and C-3 established the location ofthis methoxymethyl group at C-2. The structure of 7 wastherefore elucidated as 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone.Compound 8 was shown to have the same molecular for-mula as 7 by positive-ion FAB-MS. Their NMR data (Tables2, 3) were closely related. However, in compound 8, themethoxyl signal (dC 62.3, dH 3.85) resonated at lower field,and two unchelated carbonyl signals (d 182.7, 179.3), as wellas only two aromatic hydroxyl groups (d 10.80, 2H, br s)were observed. The methoxyl group, on the basis of itschemical shift and the lack of C-9 carbonyl carbon chelation,was assigned to the C-1 position with the aid of HMBC spec-tral analysis (Fig. 1), while the hydroxymethyl substitution atC-2 was confirmed by cross-peaks observed between themethylene protons with C-1, C-2 and C-3. The two hydroxylgroups must occupy the two remaining sites on the aromaticrings, thereby permitting assignment of structure 8 as 1-methoxy-3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone.The positive-ion FAB-MS of compound 9 displayed a pro-tonated molecular ion at m/z 581, consistent with C26H28O15.The NMR data (Tables 2, 3) in the aromatic region closely1038 Vol. 50, No. 8Table 2. 1H-NMR Spectral Data of Compounds 4—10 (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz)4 5 6 7 8 9 101 — — — — — — 8.22 (s)4 7.56 (s) 7.75 (s) 7.50 (s) 7.19 (s) 7.48 (s) 7.45 (s) 7.51 (s)5 8.14 (dd, 8.0, 1.5) 8.15a) 8.20 (dd, 9.0, 2.0) 7.42 (d, 2.5) 7.41 (d, 2.5) 7.48 (d, 2.5) 7.47 (d, 2.5)6 7.92 (dt, 8.0, 1.5) 7.85 (dt, 8.0, 1.5) 7.96a) — — — —7 7.87 (dt, 8.0, 1.5) 7.93 (dt, 8.0, 1.5) 7.96a) 7.20 (dd, 8.5, 2.5) 7.22 (dd, 8.5, 2.5) 7.23 (dd, 8.5, 2.5) 7.21 (dd, 8.5, 2.5)8 8.17 (dd, 8.0, 1.5) 8.15a) 8.24 (dd, 9.0, 2.0) 8.04 (d, 8.5) 8.32 (d, 8.5) 8.11 (d, 8.5) 8.06 (d, 8.5)1-OH — — 12.80 (s) 13.41 (s) — 13.32 (br s) —1-OCH3 3.84 (s) 3.84 (s) — — 3.85 (s)— —2-CH2OH — — — — 4.58 (s) 4.57 (d, 11.5) 4.59 (s)4.65 (d, 11.5)2-COOCH3 3.86 (s) 3.88 (s) 3.87 (s) — — — —2-CH2OCH3 — — — 4.42 (s) — — —2-CH2OCH3 — — — 3.27 (s) — — —3-OH 11.73 (s) — — 11.24 (s) 10.80 (br s) — 10.95 (s)6-OH — — — 11.02 (s) 10.80 (br s) ND 10.87 (s)19 — 5.22 (d, 7.5) 5.24 (d, 8.0) — — 5.08 (d, 7.0) —29 — 3.25 (dd, 8.5, 7.5) 3.26 (dd , 8.5, 8.0) — — 3.40 (dd, 8.5, 7.0) —39 — 3.38a) 3.35a) — — 3.37 (t, 8.5) —49 — 3.30a) 3.30a) — — 3.32a) —59 — 3.65 (m) 3.63 (m) — — 3.62 (m) —69 — 3.70 (dd, 12.0, 5.5) 3.65 (dd, 12.0, 5.0) — — 3.67 (dd, 11.0, 5.5) —— 3.95 (dd, 12.0, 2.0) 3.93 (dd, 12.0, 2.0) — — 3.97 (dd, 11.0, 2.0) —10 — 4.13 (d, 7.5) 4.14 (d, 7.5) — — 4.16 (d, 7.5) —20 — 3.00 (dd, 8.5, 7.5) 3.00 (dd, 8.5, 7.5) — — 3.02 (dd, 8.5, 7.5) —30 — 3.08 (t, 8.5) 3.07 (t, 8.5) — — 3.10 (t, 8.5) —40 — 3.30a) 3.30a) — — 3.32a) —50 — 3.00 (dd, 11.5, 1.5) 3.05 (dd, 11.5, 1.5) — — 3.03 (dd, 11.0, 1.5) —— 3.70 (dd, 11.5, 5.5) 3.70 (dd, 11.5, 5.5) — — 3.72 (dd, 11.0, 5.5) —a) Overlapped signals.

However, compound 9showed additional signals due to a b-primeveroside moiety,as confirmed by acid hydrolysis of 9 and HPLC analysis ofthe sugar fraction. The primeverosyl moiety was deduced tobe attached to the 3-hydroxyl because the anomeric proton,H-19 (d 5.08) of the primeverosyl moiety was correlated withC-3 in the HMBC spectrum. Additionally, the signal patternof the oxy-methylene protons which appeared as two dou-blets [d 4.57, 4.65 (both d, J511.5 Hz)] were indicative ofthe restricted orientation imposed by the neighboring substi-tutions. Hence, the structure of 9 was elucidated as 1,3,6-tri-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b -primeveroside.Compound 10 showed IR bands at 3337, 1655 cm21 forfree hydroxyl and unchelated carbonyl groups, respectively.The molecular formula C15H10O5 was deduced from the HR-EI-MS, showing an exact mass of 270.0521. The 1H-NMRspectrum (Table 2) showed two isolated aromatic protons (d7.51, 8.22, each s), indicative of their para disposition in thering system, in addition to a singlet for a hydroxymethylgroup (d 4.59), two aromatic hydroxyl protons (d 10.87,10.95, both s), and an ABX pattern for three aromatic pro-tons as in compounds 7—9. The chemical shifts of the hy-droxyl protons and the C-9 and C-10 carbons suggested thatno hydroxyl group is in the a position (Tables 2, 3). HMBCspectral analysis established the location of the hydroxylgroups at C-3 and C-6, and the hydroxymethyl moiety at C-2(Fig. 1). An nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experimentprovided further evidence for the substitution pattern in thering-C where irradiation of the methylene at d 4.59 resultedin enhancement of H-1 (d 8.22). Accordingly, compound 10was determined to be 3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone.Many species of the family Rubiaceae are known to con-tain substantial amounts of anthraquinones, both free and asglycosides, in addition to the high occurrence of iridoids,usually as glucosides. It is noteworthy that a total of eightbis-iridoid glucosides and 14 iridoid glucosides have beenisolated from the leaves and stems of S. scortechinii, whilenine anthraquinone derivatives of munjistin or lucidin havebeen isolated from the stems. Among them, 18 are reportedfor the first time. The occurrence of the iridoids and an-thraquinones as the dominant secondary metabolites in S.scortechinii gives chemotaxonomical proof for the relation-ship existing between the genus Saprosma and the other gen-era of the family Rubiaceae.ExperimentalOptical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeterfor 1, 2 and 3, and on a JASCO P-1020 polarimeter for 5 and 6. UV and IRspectra were recorded with JASCO V-560 and JASCO FT/IR-410 spectrom-eters, respectively. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in ppm (d) inCD3OD or DMSO-d6 with TMS as the internal standard, employing a VarianUnity plus 500 and Varian Gemini 300 spectrometers operating at 500 or300 MHz for 1H, and 125 or 75 MHz for 13C. HR-EI-MS, EI-MS and FAB-MS were recorded using a JEOL JMS DX-303 spectrometer while HR-FAB-MS were recorded using a JEOL JMS HX-110 spectrometer, with glycerolor m-NBA as the matrix. Column chromatography was performed with MCIgel CHP 20P (75—150 mm, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd.), Chroma-torex ODS (Fuji Silysia), Toyopearl HW-40F (Tosoh Co., Ltd.), SephadexLH-20 (Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.), and silica gel 60 (0.040—0.063 mm, 0.063—0.200 mm, Merck). Medium pressure liquid chromatog-raphy (MPLC) was carried out with a prepacked column; C18-20, equippedwith a JASCO PU-986 preparative pump. HPLC was performed with aJASCO 880-PU pump equipped with an 830-RI RI detector, using a columnof TOSOH TSK gel NH2 60 (4.53250 mm) with a solvent system ofH2O–CH3CN (4 : 6), and flow rate, 1 ml/min. TLC was performed on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plates (0.2 mm thick, Merck) with CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (8 : 2 : 0.2 or 7 : 3 : 0.5 or 6 : 4 : 0.5), and spots were detected byUV illumination and by spraying with 10% H2SO4 followed by heating.Plant Material Saprosma scortechinii was collected from the PasohForest Reserve, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, in March 2000. A voucher spec-imen (FRI 45413) has been deposited at the Herbarium of the Forest Re-search Institute Malaysia (FRIM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Extraction and Isolation Dried ground leaves (357 g) and stems (3 kg)were separately extracted three times with MeOH by soaking. The concen-trated extracts (68 and 253 g, respectively) were suspended in H2O and suc-cessively partitioned with EtOAc in the case of the leaves, and EtOAc, and1-BuOH in the case of the stems. The aqueous layer (48.6 g) of the leaveswas chromatographed over MCI gel CHP 20P, using H2O with increasingamounts of MeOH (20—100%) to afford 11 fractions. Fraction 2 (18.0 g)was subjected to MCI gel CHP 20P chromatography (0—100% MeOH)again to give eight subfractions. Subfraction 3 was then purified by Chroma-torex ODS (0—100% MeOH), silica gel (CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (7 : 3 : 0.5—5 : 5 : 1)) and MCI gel CHP 20P (0—25% MeOH) column chromatographyto afford saprosmoside G (1, 142.6 mg) and 6-O-epi-acetylscandoside (3,100.6 mg).

From the stems, the EtOAc layer (22.1 g) waschromatographed over silica gel with CHCl3 as eluting solvent, followed byCHCl3–MeOH (95 : 5), and CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (9 : 1 : 0.1—5 : 5 : 1) to af-ford eight fractions. Fraction 3 (3.8 g) was subjected to further silica gel col-umn chromatography with CHCl3, CHCl3–MeOH (95 : 5), and CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (9 : 1 : 0.1—6 : 4 : 1) as eluting solvent to give six subfractions.Subfraction 1 (604.0 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel with CHCl3and CHCl3–MeOH (99 : 1—9 : 1), and Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3–MeOH; 97 :3—1 : 1) to give 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone(4, 2.0 mg), and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (7,20.0 mg). Subfraction 5 (137.0 mg) after repeated silica gel column chro-matography with CHCl3–EtOAc–MeOH (50 : 50 : 1—50 : 50 : 5) afforded 1-methoxy-3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (8, 15.2 mg).The residue of fraction 4 (1.8 g) was resuspended in MeOH, and the MeOHsoluble portion was chromatrographed over Sephadex LH-20 using CHCl3–MeOH (1 : 1) to afford 3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone(10, 13.5 mg). On the other hand, the 1-BuOH layer (129.8 g) was chro-matographed over MCI gel CHP 20P (0—100% MeOH) to give eight frac-tions. Fraction 3 (16.2 g) was rechromatographed over MCI gel CHP 20P(0—100% MeOH), followed by Chromatorex ODS (0—5% MeOH), andfurther purified by MPLC ODS (H2O) to give 6-O-acetylscandoside(29.5 mg). Fraction 8 (5.7 g) was fractionated by Chromatorex ODS (50—100% MeOH) column chromatography into three subfractions. Subfraction1 was then chromatographed over MCI gel CHP 20P (30—100% MeOH),followed by further purification using MPLC ODS (30—50% MeOH), andsilica gel (CHCl3, CHCl3–MeOH (95 : 5), CHCl3–MeOH–H2O (9 : 1 : 0.1—8 : 2 : 0.1)) to give 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-anthraquinone3-O-b-primeveroside (5, 36.1 mg), 1,3-dihydroxy-2-carbomethoxy-9,10-an-thraquinone 3-O-b-primeveroside (6, 9.5 mg), 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-hydroxy-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-b-primeveroside (9, 18.6 mg), lucidin 3-O-b-primeveroside (23.5 mg), and damnacanthol 3-O-b-primeveroside (17.6mg).

Positive FAB-MS m/z:271 [M1H]1.Alkaline Hydrolysis of 1 and 2 A solution of each of the compounds(1—2 mg) in 2% KOH (5 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 1 h andneutralized with 2 N HCl. The main product in each case was detected byTLC and identified by direct comparison with deacetylasperulosidic acid(CHCl3–MeOH–H2O, 6 : 4 : 0.5, Rf: 0.4). The reaction of 2 generated thecharacteristic odor of thiomethanol.Acid Hydrolysis of 5, 6, and 9 A solution (2 ml) of the compound (1—4 mg) in 2 M H2SO4 was heated under reflux for 2 h. The reaction mixturewas filtered and the filtrate was passed through an Amberlite IR 400 (OH2)column, which was washed with H2O. The eluate was evaporated to drynessand analyzed by HPLC. Identification of glucose and xylose was carried outby comparison of their retention time with those of authentic samples; tR(glucose): 5.40 min, tR (xylose): 4.65 min.Acknowledgments We thank Mr. K.
