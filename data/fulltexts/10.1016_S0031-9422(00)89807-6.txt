Rearranged isopimarenes and other diterpenoids from Satureja gilliesiiLabbé, CeciliaCastillo, MarianoFainia, FrancescaColl, JosepConnolly, Joseph D.Seven new diterpenoids, a labdane, three isopimarenes and three rearranged isopimarenes, havebeen isolated from the flowering tops of Satureja gilliesii. Their structures are based on theirspectroscopic properties and, in the case of one compound, confirmed by crystal structure analysis.A new 18(4?3)abeoisopimarene nucleus is proposed for three of the compounds. The compoundswere tested for toxicity (brine shrimp bioassay) and antifeedant activity (Spodoptera littoralis, discchoice). The results of this study suggest the existence of chemical races of S. gilliesii. © 1994.
