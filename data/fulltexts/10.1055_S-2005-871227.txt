Abstract: 
A phytochemical investigation of the CHCl3-soluble extract of the entire plant of Egletes viscosa (Asteraceae), 
collected in Peru, afforded two new labdane glycosides, 13-hydroxy-7-oxolabda8,14-diene 13(R)-0-a-L-
arabinopyranoside and 13–hydroxy-7-oxolabda-8,14-diene 13(R)-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside, along with four 
known compounds. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic and chemical 
methods. 
 
Article: 
Egletes viscosa (L.) Less, (Asteraceae) is a small herb that is commonly known as "piro-sacha" and "macela-da-
terra" in Peru and Brazil, respectively. It has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various 
diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders and as an emmenagogue [1], [2], [3]. Several biologically active 
flavonoids and terpenoids have been reported from this plant by a team of Brazilian researchers [1], [3], [4], 
although, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been examined for anticancer activity. Thus, as part of our 
collaborative program to search for new anticancer compounds from plants [5], the CHCl3-soluble extract of the 
entire plant of E. viscosa, was examined. From this, two new labdane glycosides (1 and 2) and four known 
compounds, namely 5,7-dihydroxy-2',4'-dimethoxyflavonol [6], 8α,13-epoxylabdan-14,15-diol [7], 13-epi-
sclareol [8], and tarapacol 14-O-α-L-arabinose [9], were isolated and identified; unfortunately, none of the 
compounds had significant anticancer activity. 
 
 
Compound 1, [α]D: -49.3° (c 0.14, CHC13), was obtained as a colorless gum, The Na adduct of the molecular 
ion was determined as  C25H40O6Na by HR-ESI-MS (m/z [M Na]
+
 = 459.2717), indicative of an index of 
hydrogen deficiency of six. Three of these degrees of unsaturation were accounted for by an α,β-unsaturated 
ketone moiety, observed in the 
13
C NMR spectrum (Table 1) at δc = 200.4 (C-7), 130.4 (C-8), and 168.1 (C-9), 
and a terminal double bond, which displayed classic cis/trans coupling of three vinylic protons in the 
1
H-NMR 
spectrum (Table 1) at δH - 5.83 (1H, dd, J = 10.9, 17.6 Hz, H-14), 5.27 (1H, d, J = 17.6 Hz, H-15), and 5.31 
(1H, d, J = 10.9 Hz, H-15). A fourth degree of unsaturation was attributed to the sugar moiety, which exhibited 
characteristic proton signals at δH= 4.38 (1H, brt, J = 3.3 Hz, H-1') and 3.52 - 3.93 (5H, overlap, H-2'-H2_5’), 
[9], [10]. Also apparent were five methyl proton signals δH = 1.4] (3H, s, H-16), 1.73 (3H, s, H-17), 0.88 (3H, s, 
H-18), 0.91 (3H, s, H-19), and 1.06 (3H, s, H-20)]. The labdane diterpenoid skeleton was deduced from the 
NMR data analysis, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC experiments [11], [12], and this accounted for the 
final two degrees of unsaturanon. The presence of an L-arabinose unit was identified by comparison of the 
NMR data with those reported in the literature [9], [10], by TLC analysis after acid hydrolysis [13], and by 
measuring the αD of the hydrolyzed sugar, which was positive as expected. The positions of the functional 
groups were determined unambiguously from an HMBC NMR experiment, and the relative stereochemistry 
was assigned based on ROESY correlations and literature comparisons [11], [12]; key correlations for these 
experiments are illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, the stereochemistry of C-13 is presumed to be R based on 
biogenetic similarities to 2, discussed below. Thus, the structure of this new labclane glycoside was elucidated 
as 13-hydroxy-7-oxolabda-8,14-diene 13(R)-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (1). 
 
Compound 2, [α]D -19.5° (c 0.13, CHC13), gave the Na adduct of the molecular ion [M + Na]
+
 at m/z = 
445.2941 by HR-ESI-MS, consistent with an elemental formula of C25H42O5Na, The 
1
H-and 
13
C-NIMR spectra 
of 2 (Table 1) were comparable to those of 1, except for the absence of conjugated ketone resonances and the 
presence of olefinic signals [δH = 5.37 (1H, brs, H-7), δc = 122.3 (C-7) and 135.1 (C-8)]. The structure of 2, 
including relative stereochemistry and identity of the sugar moiety, was determined in a manner comparable to 
that of 1. The aglycone core of 2 was identified as labda-7,14-dien-13(R)-ol by comparison of the NMR data 
and optical rotation (negative value) with the literature data [14], [15], [16]; this assignment is in agreement 
with all other known natural glycosides comprising the same aglycone. As a result, the new compound 2 was 
assigned as 13-hydro-xylabda-7,14-diene 13(R)-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (2). 
 
All of the compounds isolated in this investigation were evaluated in the KB (human oral epidermoid 
carcinoma) cell cytotoxicity assay [17], but none of these displayed significant activity (EC50 values > 10 
μg/mL). The typical average EC50 value for camptothecin in this assay, which was used as a positive control, is 
0.01 μg/mL [17]. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Optical rotations, IR spectra, and UV spectra were recorded on a Rudolph Research Autopol III automatic 
polarimeter, a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR, and a Varian Cary 3 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR 
experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer with TMS as an internal standard. EI-MS and 
ESI-MS were recorded on HP5989A and Finnigan LCQ instruments, respectively. HR-ESI-MS were performed 
with a 3-Tesla Finnigan FTMS-2000 Fourier Transform mass spectrometer. For this, the samples were prepared 
in 1:1 MeOH:THF + NaCl (to give the sodiated molecular ion), sprayed from a commercial Analytica 
electrospray ionization source, and focused into the FT-MS cell using a home-built set of ion optics. Preparative 
HPLC was carried out on a Varian Prostar 210 pump system (10 mL/min) using a YMC (Wilmington, NC) 
ODS-A (250 x 25 mm, i.d„ 5 μm) column. 
 
Egletes viscosa was collected in July, 1998 in the Province of Coronel Portillo, District of Yarinacocha, Peru. It 
was taxonomically identified by one of the authors (JGG), and a voucher specimen (A4652) has been deposited 
at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL. We recognize that the above- and below-ground portions 
may have a slightly different profile of secondary metabolites. However, E, viscosa is a rather small herb, and 
as such, the entire plant was processed to supply adequate material for our programmatic studies [5]. 
 
The dried plant material (728 g) was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with hat MeOH overnight (2 x 3 L), and 
the MeOH extract concentrated under reduced pressure. This extract was partitioned between 10% aqueous 
MeOH and hexane, and the aqueous MeOH fraction was partitioned further between CHCl3- MeOH (4 : 1) and 
water. The organic layer was washed with 1% saline until there was no further evidence of tannins [18]. 
Fractionation of the organic-soluble extract (4.7 g) was initiated by flash silica gel chromatography (250 g) 
using a CHC13-MeOH gradient (12 L. total) to afford eleven pooled fractions. Fractions 3 (0.2 g, eluted with 
2.5% MeOH in CHCl3), 4 (0.3 g, eluted with 3 % MeOH in CHCl3), and 5 (0.4 g, eluted with 4% MeOH 
CHCl3) were purified using HPLC (gradient of MeCN:H2O, 70:30 to 85:15 over 45 min) to afford 5,7-
dihydruxy-2',4'-dimethoxyfla-vonol [6], 8α,3-epoxylabdan-14,15-diol [7] {[α]D: -3.6° (c 0.11, CHCl3)}, and 13-
epi-sclareol [8], [19] {[α]D: +45° (c 0.11, CHCl3)} from fraction 3, compound 2 (tR = 36 min) from fraction 4, 
as well as compound 1 (tR = 28 min) and tarapacol 14-O-α-L-arabi-nose [9] {[α]D: + 5.7° (c 0.23, CHCl3)} from 
fraction 5.

Compounds 1 and 2 and tarapacol 14-O-α-L-arabinose were applied to a silica gel TLC plate and were 
hydrolyzed with 1 N HCl for 1 h by heating. After removal of residual HCl under nitrogen, the plate was 
developed using CHC13-MeOH-H2O (2:1:0.1). The air-dried plate was sprayed with 10% H2SO4 in MeOH-H2O 
(5 :1) and heated at 120° C to identify spots that were attributed to arabinose by comparison to a reference 
standard of arabinose 0.3) [13]. Moreover, to determine if the sugar was L-arabinose or D-arabinose, aqueous 
solutions of 1 and 2 (5 mg, each) in 1 N NCl were heated at 110°C for 1 h under an N2 atmosphere. After 
drying under N2, the sugars and the aglycones were separated by liquid-liquid partitioning between CHCl3 and 
H2O. The sugar fractions were confirmed as L-arabinose (literature [α]D: + 104°) by comparison of their optical 
rotation values ([α]D: +95° and [α]D: + 88° for the sugars of 1 and 2, respectively). 
 
All compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells as described 
previously [17].
