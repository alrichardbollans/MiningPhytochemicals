In this study, a bioactivity-oriented screening platform based on a modified Ellman’s method and HPLC-QTOF MStechnique was developed to rapidly screen active agents of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. The 60% ethanol fraction from anethyl acetate extract exhibited the most potential anticholinesterase activity. Fifteen steroid saponins were identified by the massspectrum, standards and literature reports. Twenty-five compounds were isolated from the active fraction. The results showedthat compounds with the C6–C3–C6skeleton probably had both AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities. Xanthone and benzenederivatives exhibited no or little activity. Lignans showed weak BuChE inhibitory activity. The steroidal saponins demonstratedmoderate or weak AChE inhibitory activity.1. IntroductionAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerativedisorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterizedby deposits of aberrant proteins, namely, 𝛽-amyloid (A𝛽)and 𝜏-protein, loss of synapses, death of cholinergic neurons,and oxidative stress [1, 2]. The etiopathogenesis of AD stillremains unknown, although the neurodegeneration leadsto remarkable reduction of neurotransmitter acetylcholineat the synaptic clefts [3, 4]. An effective strategy to slowdown the progression of deterioration in AD patients is usinganticholinesterase inhibitors.Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase(BuChE) constitute the group of cholinesterases. AChEhydrolyses acetylcholine (ACh) and is mainly associated withnerves and muscles, being typically found on the synapses.AChE inhibitors are widely used for the symptomatictreatment of AD to enhance central cholinergic transmission.BuChE hydrolyses butyrylcholine (BuCh) and is synthesizedby the liver, being found in large concentration in serum [5].In healthy brains, AChEhydrolyzes themajority ofAChwhileBuChE plays a secondary role. However, as AD progresses,BuChE can compensate for AChE when the activity of AChEis inhibited by AChE inhibitors. Thus, BuChE hydrolyses thealready depleted levels of ACh in these patients [6]. It hasbeen proposed that individuals with low activity of BuChEcan sustain cognitive functions better than individuals withnormal BuChE activity. Furthermore, BuChE inhibitors havebeen reported to produce a significant increase in brainextracellular AChE without triggering severe peripheral orcentral side effects [7].Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge, which belongs to thefamily Liliaceae, is widely distributed in China [8]. The rhi-zomes ofAnemarrhena asphodeloides Bge have been reportedHindawi Publishing CorporationEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineVolume 2014, Article ID 524650, 11 pageshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/5246502 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicineto have the cholinesterase inhibitory activity relevant totreatment of AD [9]. In order to find the candidate of adrug treating AD, the activities of fractions and compoundswere assayed. Screening and identification of bioactive con-stituents in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are thekeys of the development of TCMs [10, 11]. However, thecomplexity and variability of TCMs present a challenge tothe identification of their structures. Now more and moreattention has been attracted to bioactivity-based LC-MS/MSidentification technology owing to its high efficiency andhighspecificity [12, 13].In this work, we used a bioactivity-oriented screeningstrategy, which was based on amodified Ellman’smethod andhigh performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HPLC-QTOF MS) technique.The 60% ethanol fraction from an ethyl acetate extractshowed the most potential anticholinesterase activity. Fif-teen steroid saponins were identified by the mass spec-trum, standards, and literature reports. Twenty-five com-pounds were isolated from the active fraction. Compoundswith the C6–C3–C6skeleton probably had both AChE andBuChE inhibitory activities. Xanthone and benzene deriva-tives exhibited no or little activity. Lignans showed weakBuChE inhibitory activity. The steroidal saponins demon-strated moderate or weak AChE inhibitory activity.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant Material. The rhizomes of Anemarrhena asphode-loides Bge were purchased from Beijing Tongrentang phar-macy. The plant materials were identified by Professor JincaiLu, Department of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica,Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.2.2. General Instrumental Equipment. HPLC system (Agilent,USA) consisted of a model G1276A pump, model G1367BAutosampler and model G1316A UV detector. The chro-matograph was equipped with a reversed-phase C18 columnof Grace Alltima (250mm × 4.6mm, 5 𝜇m). The QTOF-MS system (Bruker, Germany) with an ESI source wasperformed. HPLC separations were performed on a Hitachi655-15 series pumping system equipped with a Hitachi L-2490 refractive index detector using a YMC-Park ODS-Acolumn (250× 10mm I.D, S-5 𝜇m, and 12 nm). NMR spectrawere performed on a Bruker ARX-300, ARX-400, and ARX-600 spectrometer using trimethylchlorosilane as the internalstandard. Column chromatography was performed on a200–300mesh silica gel (Qingdao Marine Chemical Factory,People’s Republic of China). Column chromatography wasperformed using YMCODS-A gel (12 nm S-75𝜇m, YMCCo.,Ltd., Japan) andD-101macroporous adsorption resin (Shang-hai Hualing Resin Factory, People’s Republic of China).TLC was performed with precoated silica gel GF254plates(Qingdao Marine Chemical Factory, People’s Republic ofChina). Microplate reader (Thermofisher Scientific, Finland)was used to test the activities. Acetylthiocholine iodide, S-butyrylthiocholine iodide, AChE, and BuChE were boughtfrom Sigma Company.2.3. Extraction Procedures. Dried rhizomes of Anemarrhenaasphodeloides Bge were powdered into a homogeneous sizeby a disintegrator and then sieved (60 mesh). The materialswere extracted by three different techniques (ultrasonic,heat reflux, and cold soak techniques). Various solventsincluding petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate,acetone, methanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 50% ethanol,30% ethanol, and water were used for preparing activefractions. Accurate 5.0 g of the Anemarrhena asphodeloidesBge powders was weighted into ten Erlenmeyer flasks con-taining the mentioned ten solvents of 500mL individuallyand then extracted with ultrasonic-assisted method twice(30min each). After filtering, the filtrates were amalgamatedand evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporator (50∘C). Forthe heat reflux, the powders of 5.0 g were soaked in differentsolvents of 50mL each for 30min. Then, the heated refluxextraction experiments were conducted in water bath (90∘C)for 2 h. The solutions were filtrated when they were still hot.Extractions were carried out for three times and the filtrateswere evaporated to dryness. Lastly, 5.0 g of the powders wasaccurately weighed and soaked in 500mL solvents overnightand then evaporated the filtrates to dryness.2.4. AChE and BuChE Inhibitory Assay. Cholinesteraseinhibitory activity was evaluated using the modified methodof Ellman. For AChE inhibitory assay, the reaction mixtureconsisted of 50 𝜇L of 100mM PBS, pH 8.0, 25 𝜇L of 15mMacetylthiocholine iodide, and 25 𝜇L of agents (1mg/mL forextracts, 0.1mg/mL for compounds) in a 96-well plate. Themixture was preincubated in 4∘C for 10min, and after that,25 𝜇L of AchE (0.226U/mL) and 125 𝜇L of 3mM DTNBwere added. The reactions were kept in 37∘C for 20min andthen scanned at 412 nm with a microplate reader. For BuChEinhibitory assay, the same procedures were followed exceptfor the use of substrate and enzyme, and S-butyrylthiocholineiodide and BuchE were used, respectively [14]. All of theexperiments were repeated at least three times.2.5. Structure Characterization and Identification of ActiveFraction. The ethyl acetate extract dealt with by the ultra-sonic method was applied to a D-101macroporous resincolumn and eluted with ethanol and water to give 0%, 20%,40%, 60%, 80%, and 95% ethanol fractions. The constituentsof active fraction were assayed by HPLC-QTOF-MS. HPLCsystem (Agilent, USA) consisted of a model G1276A pump, amodel G1367B Autosampler, and a model G1316A UV detec-tor. The chromatograph was equipped with a reversed-phaseC18 column of Grace Alltima (250mm × 4.6 mm, 5𝜇m)eluted with a gradient mobile phase. Mobile phases werewater with 0.1% of formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B). Thegradient used was as follows: 0min, 5% B; 0–10min, 5% to15%B; 10–18min, 15% to 20%B; 18–23min, 20% to 23%B; 23–30min, 23% to 25% B; 30–48min, 25% to 30% B; 48–55min,30% to 50% B; 55–80min, 50% to 100% B.

The Activities of the Extracts. Screening the extractsof Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge dealing with three dif-ferent techniques and ten kinds of solvents showed thatall the extracts demonstrated no AchE inhibitory activitybut exhibited BuChE inhibitory activity. The extract dealingwith dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and acetone had muchmore inhibition ratio than the others. The ultrasonic methodand the cold soak method were better than the heat refluxmethod. It was found that Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bgeextracted with ethyl acetate by the ultrasonic technique hadthe most potential anticholinesterase activity. The resultson the effects of the tested extracts on AChE and BuChEinhibitory activities were summarized in Table 1.3.2. Screening the Active Fraction. The extract dealing withethyl acetate by the ultrasonic method was applied to a D-101macroporous resin column and elutedwith ethanol andwaterto give 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 95% ethanol fractions.Then they were tested on AChE and BuChE inhibitoryactivities. It indicated that the extract was partitioned into sixfractions and active compounds were concentrated into 60%ethanol fraction. The results were summarized in Figure 2.Donepezil was used as positive drug with the inhibition ratioof 98.2% and 79.8%.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable 1: The effects of the tested extracts on AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities.Solvents AChE inhibition (%) BuChE inhibition (%)Ultrasonic method Heat reflux method Cold soak method Ultrasonic method Heat reflux method Cold soak methodPetroleum ether — — — — — 1.6 ± 0.1Dichloromethane — — — 41.5 ± 0.5 15.7 ± 0.7 41.2 ± 0.6Ethyl acetate — — — 44.1 ± 0.5 27.7 ± 0.4 40.8 ± 0.8Acetone — — — 38.8 ± 0.3 22.2 ± 0.3 37.9 ± 0.7Methanol — — — 12.3 ± 0.4 5.4 ± 0.2 7.1 ± 0.395% ethanol — — — 4.9 ± 0.2 2.8 ± 0.1 3.9 ± 0.370% ethanol — — — 1.8 ± 0.1 — 1.6 ± 0.250% ethanol — — — 2.8 ± 0.1 — 0.5 ± 0.130% ethanol — — — 2.4 ± 0.1 — 1.8 ± 0.2Water — — — — — —AChE inhibition ratio of donepezil: 98.0 ± 0.5; BuChE inhibition ratio of donepezil: 80.2 ± 0.6.9080706050403020100Inhibition ratio (%)Water 20% ethanol40% ethanol60% ethanol80% ethanol95% ethanol0.47.755.113.181.332.614.7AChE inhibitionBuChE inhibitionFigure 2: The effects of ethanol and water fractions on AChE andBuChE inhibitory activities.3.3.

Similarly, the fragment ions at 𝑚/𝑧271.1636 [417.3410 – C8H18O2]+ and 253.1493 [271.1636 –H2O]+ were also daughter ions produced from the parentions by consecutive elimination of the E-ring and H2O.Timosaponin AIII displaying a series of fragment ionsat 𝑚/𝑧 579.3969 [M + H – 162]+, 417.3389 [M + H – 2× 162]+, and 399.3294 [M + H – H2O – 2 × 162]+ couldbe attributed to losses of one glucosyl, one galactosyl, andH2O from 741.4406 [M + H]+. The characteristic fragmentions at 𝑚/𝑧 273.2230 [417.3389 – C8H16O2]+ and 255.2105[273.2230 – H2O]+ resulted from consecutive losses of E-ringand H2O. Timosaponin AIV had the same formula and thesimilar fragmentation behavior as timosaponin AIII.Based on the exact mass, authentic standards, fragmentions, retention time, and structures in the literature [15–24],the structures of the fifteen compounds (Figure 6) from the60% ethanol fraction (Figure 7) were deduced as follows.Peak 1 presented [M + Na]+ ion with mass accuracy at𝑚/𝑧 959.4833. The molecular mass was 16Da heavier thanthat of timosaponin BII. It produced fragment ions at 𝑚/𝑧919 [M + H – H2O]+, 757 [M + H – H2O – 162]+, 595 [M+ H – H2O – 2 × 162]+, 433 [M + H – H2O – 3 × 162]+, and415 [M + H – 2 × H2O – 3 × 162]+, which were attributed8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70Time (min)0.00.20.40.60.81.01 32 48 14 5 10 9 7 6 13 11 15 12 ×105IntensityFigure 7: The peak numbers of 60% ethanol fraction.to the sequential losses of H2O, one galactosyl, two glucosyls,and H2O. Moreover, it was noteworthy that the fragmentions at 𝑚/𝑧 271 [415 – C8H16O2]+ and 253 [271 – H2O]+originating from the consecutive elimination of the E-ringand H2O were observed in the MS/MS spectrum. It wassuggested that one more hydroxyl group substituent was atC2 position. Based on the fragment ions and retention time,it was tentatively identified as timosaponin N.Peak 2, the major fragment ions at 𝑚/𝑧 901 [M + H –H2O]+, 739 [M + H – H2O – 162]+, 577 [M + H – H2O – 2 ×162]+, 415 [M + H – H2O – 3 × 162]+, 273 [415 – C8H14O2]+,and 255 [273 – H2O]+, could be attributed to losses of H2O,three hexosyl residues, one formula C8H14O2,and H2O fromthe ion [M+Na]+ (𝑚/𝑧 941.4726).Therewas one double bondat the C25 and C27 positions [8]. Peak 2 was identified astimosaponin M.Peak 3 was definitely identified as timosaponin BIIin comparison with an authentic standard. The precursorion [M + Na]+ at 𝑚/𝑧 943.4886 was the base peak inESI experiments. Peaks 4 and 5 showed the same formulaand similar fragment ions as peak 3. Based on the chro-matography behavior of steroidal saponin on a C18column,peak 4 was tentatively identified as the C25R stereoisomerof timosaponin BII. While peak 5 was identified as 25S-officinalisnin-I or its isomer [8].Peak 6, peak 7, and peak 8 were identified as timosaponinBIII, timosaponin G, andAnemarrhena saponin I in compar-ison with authentic standards.Peak 9 showed [M + Na]+ (𝑚/𝑧 779.4189) and [M +H – H2O]+ (𝑚/𝑧 739.4244) ions. The fragment ions at 𝑚/𝑧577 [M + H – H2O – 162]+, 415 [M + H – H2O – 2 ×162]+, 273 [415 – C8H14O2]+, and 255 [273 – H2O]+ wereproduced, corresponding to the neutral losses of one glucosyl,one galactosyl, E-ring, and H2O. It was tentatively identifiedas isomer of timosaponin G.Peak 10 presented [M + Na]+ ion with mass accuracy at𝑚/𝑧 779.4184. In addition to the dehydrated product ion at𝑚/𝑧 739 [M + H − H2O]+, a series of characteristic productions at 𝑚/𝑧 595 [M + H – 162]+, 433 [M + H – 2 × 162]+, 415[M + H – H2O – 2 × 162]+, 271 [415 – C8H16O2]+, and 253[271 – H2O]+ were also observed. It was tentatively identifiedas 25(27)-ene-Anemarrhena saponin I.Peak 11was calculated asC39H64O14based on the accuratemass measurement [M + Na]+ (𝑚/𝑧 779.4187). The ions at𝑚/𝑧 757 [M+H]+, 595 [M+H– 162]+, 433 [M+H–2× 162]+,415 [M +H –H2O – 2 × 162]+, 271 [415 – C8H16O2]+, and 253[271 – H2O]+ indicated one hydroxyl group substituent of theaglycone. It was tentatively identified as timosaponin A2.Peaks 12 and 13 were identified as timosaponin AIV andtimosaponin AIII by authentic standards. Peak 14 yielded thesodic adduct ion [M + Na]+ at 𝑚/𝑧 763.4237. It displayeda series of fragment ions at 𝑚/𝑧 579 [M + H – 162]+,417 [M + H – 2 × 162]+, 273 [417 – C8H16O2]+, and 255[273 – H2O]+. The retention time of steroidal saponinswith the 25R configuration was longer than those with the25S configuration. Peak 14 was tentatively identified as 25R-timosaponin AIII.Peak 15 showed the [M + H]+ ion at 𝑚/𝑧 579.3892(C33H55O8), 162 Da less than that of timosaponin AIII. Theproduct ions such as 𝑚/𝑧 417 [M + H – 162]+, 399 [M + H –H2O – 162]+, 273 [417 – C8H16O2]+, and 255 [273 – H2O]+could be found in their MS/MS spectrum. From this, peak 15was identified as timosaponin A-I.3.4. Isolation and Purification of Compounds from Ane-marrhena asphodeloides Bge. Twenty-five compounds wereobtained after repeated isolation and purification. On thebasis of spectroscopic analysis (MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR,DEPT135, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY spectra) and in com-parison with the previously reported spectral data [25–34],the structures of these compounds were shown in Figure 8.All the isolates were subjected to the cholinesterase inhibitoryactivity assay (Table 3).4. DiscussionThe anticholinesterase activity of the agents was tested inthe presence of a known concentration. It was one of theapproaches to study the effect of treating Alzheimer’s disease.The anticholinesterase inhibition ratio of the agents wasexpressed as percentage inhibition ratio based on the opticaldensity. The conditions of AChE and BuChE inhibitoryassay were confirmed by a series of literature reports andexperiments.To determine which fraction has anticholinesterase activ-ity, the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides was fraction-ated further by a series of extractions with different solventsand techniques. The findings revealed that more bioactivecomponents would be extracted by dichloromethane, ethylacetate, and acetone.The extracts dealt with by the ultrasonicand cold soak method had higher inhibition ratio than theextracts dealt with by the heat reflux method. It is proposedthat the molecular structures of the active constituents maybe destroyed at a high temperature.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9HOHOHOHO HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO HOHOHOOHOHOHOHOH OH OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOO O OOOOOOHOHO-GlcO-GlcO-GlcO-GlcO-GlcO-GlcHHHHHH H H HHHHHGlcGlcGlcGlcGlcXylGlc 422 3Gal-OH3COH3COH3COH3COH3COH3COGlc Man-O2Glc Gal-ORha Glc2Glc Gal-O2Glc Gal-O 2Glc Gal-O 2Glc Gal-O2Glc Gal-O2Glc Gal-O 2Glc Gal-OOCH3OCH3OCH3OCH3OCH3 OCH3OCH3OCH31–6CH2OH1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 2021 22 23 24 25Figure 8: The structures of the isolated compounds.The effect of ethyl acetate extract extracted by the ultra-sonic method on inhibiting activity of cholinesterase wasbetter than those dealt with by other solvents and methods.The ethyl acetate crude extract ofAnemarrhena asphodeloidesmay also contain many compounds with differing polarities,so it was fractionated further by a D-101 macroporousresin column. The bioactive compounds of the 60% ethanolfraction were analyzed by HPLC-QTOF-MS system.The type of compounds in the 60% ethanol fraction couldbe deduced by the MS data. If the ions [M + Na]+ and [M +H − H2O]+ were detected and the [M+H]+ ion was notobserved, the saponin would be a furostanol saponin withthe C22 hydroxyl group. If the ions at 𝑚/𝑧 417, 255, and 273were detected, there should be no substituent attached to thesarsasaponin. If the ions at 𝑚/𝑧 433 and 415 were observed,there should be one more hydroxyl group substituent on theaglycone.The retention time of saponins would be affected bythe number, classes, and connection orders of sugar moietiesand the number and position of hydroxyl group substituentat the aglycone. What is more, the retention time of steroidalsaponins with the 25R configuration was longer than thosewith the 25S configuration on a C18 column.Twenty-five compounds were isolated from the activefraction. The structure-activity relationships were discussedbased on the results of cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Itshowed that the compounds with the C6–C3–C6skeletonprobably had both AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities.Compound 3 showed potential BuChE inhibitory activititywith the inhibition ratio of 75.8%. Xanthone and benzenederivatives exhibited no or little activity. Lignans showedweak BuChE inhibitory activity. The steroidal saponins hadmoderate or weak AChE inhibitory activity. It was supposedthat addingOHgroups to the steroidal saponinsmay increasethe effect a little. Although some of the individual compoundsexhibited potential in vitro activity, they were less effectivethan the 60% ethanol fraction and this might be due to asynergistic action among the active components ormaybe themost active constituents have not been isolated by us.Steroid saponins were considered as potentially drugpreventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases, such asAlzheimer’s disease. However, we found that compoundswith the C6–C3–C6skeleton probably had both AChE andBuChE inhibitory activities, especially compound 3. Theactivity in vivo needs to be tested in the future.5.

Anemarrhena aspho-deloides Bge extracted with ethyl acetate by the ultrasonictechnique had the most potential anticholinesterase activity.The extract was partitioned into six fractions after applying toa D-101 macroporous resin column, and active compoundswere concentrated into 60% ethanol fraction. Fifteen mainpeaks of this fraction were identified and tentatively charac-terized based on the HPLC-QTOF-MS technique, standards,and literature reports. Twenty-five compounds were obtainedfrom 60% ethanol fraction after repeated isolation and purifi-cation. The structure-activity relationships were discussedbased on the results of cholinesterase inhibitory activity.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interestsregarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to financial supports from Nat-ural Science Foundation of China (81373925), “Liaon-ing Bai Qian Wan Talents Program” (2011921044), SocialDevelopment Project of Liaoning Science and TechnologyCommittee (2011404012-3), Liaoning Province DoctoralScientific Research Start-up Funds (20111139), Project ofShenyang Science and Technology Bureau (F12-161-9-00),Program for Innovative Research Team of the Ministry ofEducation, and Program for Liaoning Innovative ResearchTeam in University.References[1] M.
