Um novo alcalóide quaternário natural, Nb-metilvoachalotina (1), três alcalóides indólicos
diméricos, conodurina (2), voacamina (3) e tabernamina (4), e os três alcalóides monoméricos
19S-heyneanina (5), coronaridina (6) e voacangina (7) foram isolados da casca das raízes de
Tabernaemontana laeta. Os triterpenos conhecidos 3-O-acetil--amirina, 3-O-acetil--amirina,
3-O-acetil-lupeol e 3-O-acetiltaraxasterol e os fitoesteróides -sitosterol e seu derivado 3-O--D-
glicopiranosídeo foram também identificados. As estruturas dos compostos foram elucidadas com
base na análise de dados espectroscópicos.
A new natural quaternary alkaloid, Nb-methylvoachalotine (1), was obtained from the root
bark of Tabernaemontana laeta together with three dimeric indole alkaloids, conodurine (2),
voacamine (3) and tabernamine (4), and the monomeric indole alkaloids 19S-heyneanine (5),
coronaridine (6) and voacangine (7). The known triterpenes -amyrin acetate, -amyrin acetate,
lupeol acetate and taraxasterol acetate and the phytosterol -sitosterol and its 3-O--D-glucoside
were also identified. The structures of the compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic
studies.

Introduction
Indole alkaloids exhibit numerous biological activities
(such as anti-tumor, anti-microbial, anti-hypertensive and
central nervous system stimulant1). They can be found in
plants of the Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae, and Loganiaceae
families1,2.
Among the Apocynaceae, the genus Tabernaemontana
is especially rich in indole alkaloids. They are useful
chemical markers of the genus, and also have a great value
for the classification of the individual species within the
genus3. The classification of individual species only on the
basis of morphological characters has been difficult, leading
to numerous synonyms4. The species Tabernaemontana
laeta Mart. has the homotypic synonym Peschiera laeta
(Mart.) Miers, and the heterotypic synonyms T. laeta var.
pubiflora Muell. Arg., T. laeta var. minor Muell. Arg., T.
laeta var. densa Muell. Arg., T. spixiana Mart. ex Muell.
Arg. and T. breviflora Muell. Arg.4. Some previous
phytochemical studies have been published under the name
Peschiera laeta Mart.5,6.
As part of our continuing interest in the phytochemical
investigation of Tabernaemontana species occurring in
Brazil, we decided to study T. laeta, a native species of the
Atlantic forest in Southeastern Brazil. Popularly known as
“esperta” or “guarana”, this species is generally considered
poisonous. In a recent paper, we reported the complete 1H
and 13C chemical shift assignments of the dimeric indole
alkaloids conodurine (2) and voacamine (3); both isolated
from its methanolic extracts7.
In the present study, we report the phytochemical
analysis of the crude extracts of T. laeta, including the
isolation of the new alkaloid Nb-methylvoachalotine (1).
Results and Discussion
Chromatographic purification of T. laeta root bark
hexane and methanol extracts yielded triterpenes and
369A New Natural Quaternary Indole Alkaloid IsolatedVol. 12, No. 3, 2001
phytosterols common in plants, including other
Tabernaemontana species8. The triterpene acetates were
obtained as a mixture of -amyrin acetate, -amyrin acetate,
lupeol acetate and taraxasterol acetate. They were identified
by comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data with
literature values9. The phytosterol -sitosterol, isolated from
the hexane extract, and its 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl
derivative, isolated from the methanol extract, were also
identified by comparison with published 1H and 13C NMR
spectral data, including the data of the peracetyl derivative
of 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl--sitosterol10.
In addition to the dimeric alkaloids conodurine (2) and
voacamine (3), previously reported7, other structurally
related alkaloids were obtained during a detailed
phytochemical analysis of the methanol extract. The known
indole alkaloids tabernamine (4)11, 19S-heyneanine (5, vide
infra), coronaridine (6)12 and voacangine (7)13 were
identified on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR spectral data,
including homonuclear 1H-1H-COSY and heteronuclear 1H-
13C 2D shift-correlated NMR experiments14.
The 19S configuration shown in 5 was clearly
established by comparison of the NMR chemical shifts
370 J. Braz. Chem. SocMedeirosa et al.
obtained with those reported for heyneanine (5) and its
epimer, (19R)-epiheyneanine (8). Due to hydrogen bonding
between the hydroxyl group at C-19 and the nearby
nitrogen the 1-hydroxyethyl moiety has a rigid confor-
mation (see partial structures 5a and 8a), leading to
considerable chemical shift differences. In the 1H NMR
spectrum especially the chemical shifts of the 3H-18 and
H-19 hydrogens show large differences. Values of H 1.11
(3H-18) and 4.12 (H-19) for 5 and H 1.27 (3H-18) and
3.92 (H-19) for 8 have been reported (both in CDCl3)15.
For the isolated compound 5 values of H 1.11 (3H-18)
and 4.16 (H-19) were measured. The chemical shifts of
the carbon atoms CH2-15 (C 22.9), CH-19 (C 72.3) and
CH-21 (C 59.7) reported for 513 are significantly different
when compared with those reported for 8: C 28.60 (CH2-
15), 70.70 (CH-19) and 54.30 (CH-21)16,17. The values
measured pointed to an identical configuration for the chiral
carbon C-19 of the isolated product and heyneanine (5)
[C 22.93 (CH2-15), 71.34 (CH-19) and 59.78 (CH-21)].
By the -effect of the methyl group (CH3-18) CH2-15
(	C=5.67 ppm) in 5 and CH-21 (	C=5.40 ppm) in 8 are
shielded. In the absence of this effect these carbon atoms
appear deshielded [5: C 59.87 (CH-21); 8: C 28.60 (CH2-
15)].
The new indole alkaloid 1 was isolated from the
methanol extract. The ESMS showed a molecular ion at
m/z 381 daltons ([M].+), in agreement with the molecular
formula C23H29N2O3 and with 1H and 13C NMR spectral
data. This alkaloid was nearly insoluble in chloroform and
its NMR spectra were therefore obtained in DMSO-d6.
Carbon-13 NMR experiments (HBBD and DEPT) revealed
the presence of four methyl groups, four methylenes (sp3),
eight methines (three sp3 and five sp2) and seven quaternary
carbon atoms (one sp3 and six sp2). The 1H-1H-COSY,
HMQC and HMBC experiments established geminal and
vicinal hydrogen interactions as well as direct (1JCH) and
two and three bond correlations between carbon and
hydrogen atoms in the structure (Table 1). These data

371A New Natural Quaternary Indole Alkaloid IsolatedVol. 12, No. 3, 2001
revealed that 1 is closely related to voachalotine (vide infra),
differing by the presence of an additional methyl group.
The presence of the indole nucleus was clearly indicated
by the 1H and 13C aromatic signals (Table 1). Typically the
1H NMR revealed three singlet signals corresponding to
methyl groups at H 3.67, 3.65 and 3.16. Through analysis
of the HMBC spectrum these signals were assigned by
corresponding cross-peaks, due to heteronuclear spin-spin
coupling via three (3JCH) bonds, to a carbomethoxy function
and two methyl groups linked to the indole N-1 and N-4
(aliphatic Nb), respectively: a) C-22 (C 172.65) with MeO-
22 (H 3.67), H-5 (H 4.19) and 2H-17 (H 3.53 and 3.40);
b) MeN-1 (H 3.65) with both C-2 (C 132.16) and C-13
(C 137.55) and c) MeN-4 (H 3.16) with both CH-5 (C
63.16) and CH-3 (C 57.02). The complete analysis of this
HMBC spectrum in combination with additional NMR
spectral data also allowed the identification of a skeleton
as that of the indole alkaloid voachalotine18 and the total
1H and 13C chemical shift assignments, as summarized in
Table 1. The stereochemistry of the chiral carbon atom C-
16 shown in 1 was clearly indicated by the chemical shift
of the signal at H 3.67 corresponding to the hydrogen of
the MeO-22 (carbomethoxy group). In its epimer this signal
should appear at about H 2.50, as observed in 2 and 3 by
singlet signals of the MeO-22’ at H 2.51 and 2.46,
respectively7. Thus, the new quaternary indole alkaloid
isolated from Tabernaemontana laeta was characterized
as Nb-methylvoachalotine (1), a new natural product.
Although it has been synthesized from voachalotine in a
previous study18, only the 13C NMR data of the iodide salt
were reported.
In accordance with the revision published by
Leeuwenberg4, the alkaloid series isolated in this study from
T. laeta are closely related to those previously reported
from Peschiera laeta: geissoschizol, affinine, akuammidine,
normacusine B, vobasine, conodurine and voacamine5,6.
The similarity of the alkaloids found in this work in
comparison with those from two other Brazilian
Tabernaemontana species is remarkable. From T.
solanifolia were reported the following alkaloids:
isovoacangine, isovoacristine, coronaridine, voacangine,
voacangine hydroxyindolenine, heyneanine, voacamine,
voachalotine and 12-methoxy-Nb-methylvoachalotine
[reported under the name Peschiera campestris (Rizz.)
Rizz. by Gower, Pereira and Marsaioli19], while from T.
hystrix were reported the following alkaloids: 12-methoxy-
Nb-methylvoachalotine, 12-methoxy-Nb-methylvoacha-
lotine ethyl ester and fuchsiaefoline (reported under the
name Peschiera fuchsiaefolia by Braga and Reis18). This
similarity might point to a close taxonomic relationship of
these recognized species.
Experimental
General
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with
Bruker DRX spectrometers operating at 400 and 600 MHz
and 100 and 150 MHz, respectively, in CDCl3 or DMSO-
d6, using the residual solvent signals as internal standard
(Table 1).
Plant material
The root bark of Tabernaemontana laeta Mart. was
collected in July 1997 at Bom Jesus do Itabapoana, Rio de
Janeiro State, Brazil, and identified by Dr. A. J. M.
Leeuwenberg of the Agricultural University of
Wageningen, The Netherlands. A voucher specimen (WAG)
is deposited at the herbarium of the Agricultural University
of Wageningen, Netherlands.
Extraction and isolation
Dried and powdered root bark (1.06 kg) from T. laeta
Mart. was extracted at room temperature using hexane and
methanol, furnishing, after solvent evaporation, crude
hexane (33.4 g) and methanol (120.0 g) extracts,
respectively.
The hexane extract was purified by silica gel
chromatography, with a gradient of EtOAc in hexane to
give four fractions. The second fraction supplied large
amounts (28.0 g) of a product, which by recrystallization
in hexane, furnished a mixture of the four triterpenes, -
amyrin acetate, -amyrin acetate, lupeol acetate and
taraxasterol acetate. The third fraction yielded, after
recrystallization, -sitosterol (220.0 mg). The fourth
fraction yielded, after column chromatography with the
same system, the alkaloid voacangine13 (7, 15.0 mg).
The methanol extract was redissolved in MeOH/H2O
(3:1) and extracted with CHCl3. The CHCl3 layer was
evaporated and further partitioned between MeOH and
hexane (1:1). After another extraction with hexane, the
hydromethanolic fraction was extracted with EtOAc. The
methanol phase yielded 55.0 g upon evaporation, the
hexane phase 22.4 g and the EtOAc phase 2.0 g.
The EtOAc extract was chromatographed on a silica
gel column with a gradient of EtOAc in hexane supplying
four fractions. Preparative TLC of fractions 1 and 2
(hexane:EtOAc 5%) supplied the alkaloids 5 (146.0 mg)
and 6 (19.0 mg), respectively.
30.0 g of the methanol extract was chromatographed
on a silica gel column and eluted with a gradient of EtOAc
372 J. Braz. Chem. SocMedeirosa et al.
in hexane, yielding four fractions; fraction 1 (1.3 g)
presented additional amounts of 5; fraction 2 (9.8 g) was
rechromatographed with a gradient of CH2Cl2 in hexane,
supplying additional amounts of 6 (0.6 g) and 7 (340.0
mg); fraction 3 (10.5 g) was rechromatographed in the same
way, supplying the alkaloids 2 (130.0 mg) and 3 (315.0
mg). Fraction 4 (7.3 g) was rechromatographed with a
gradient of MeOH in CH2Cl2 furnishing 12 fractions, of
which, fractions 3-4 (520.0 mg) furnished the alkaloid 4
(53.0 mg) after rechromatography with a gradient of MeOH
in CH2Cl2, followed by column chromatography over
Sephadex LH-20 with methanol. Fractions 6-7 (1.2 g)
yielded a crystalline substance, characterized as Nb-
methylvoachalotine (1, 38.0 mg). Fractions 10-12 (3.6 g)
supplied an amorphous powder; this material (100.0 mg)
was acetylated and the acetylated product was identified
as 3-O--D-glucosyl--sitosterol tetraacetate.
The five alkaloids 2-6, as well as triterpenes, -sitosterol
and 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl--sitosterol tetraacetate were
identified by the analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra
and comparison with literature values7-13,15-17.
