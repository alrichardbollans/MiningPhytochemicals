In the course of our investigations, we havebeen attempting to isolate the anti-inflammatory principlesfrom a number of botanical species, some of which are usedfor the treatment of inflammatory diseases in Spanish tradi-tional medicine. Jasonia glutinosa D.C. (Chiliadenus sax-atilis CASS.5Chiliadenus glutinosus (L.) FOURR.) is a mem-ber of the subtribe Inulinae, tribe Inuleae, Fam. Asteraceaeand occurs in the Mediterranean and adjacent areas.1—4) Inboth folk and modern traditional medicine, this plant, underthe name of “te de roca,” is very popular as a stomachic aswell as a component in preparations showing beneficial ef-fects such as antispasmodic and as an anti-inflammatorydrug. The tea made from its dried leaves is a popular bever-age in the Iberian Peninsula.5) However, no reports as to itsexperimental biological activity have been found in the litera-ture.In a previous study performed as part of our collaborativesearch for novel anti-inflammatory agents from plants, theleaves of J. glutinosa were found to contain flavonol glyco-sides and four sesquiterpenes: lucinone, glutinone, 5-epi-kut-dtriol and kutdtriol.6—8) Plant sesquiterpenes are secondarymetabolites widely distributed in the higher plant kingdomand are known to show diverse biological and pharmacologi-cal actions, including anti-inflammatory activity.9—11) Sincethe effect of sesquiterpenes found in the leaves of J. glutinosaon the key enzymes of inflammation has not yet been studied,their inhibitory activities on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) (PG-synthase and TX-synthase) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)have been investigated in the present paper.MATERIALS AND METHODSTest Compounds Lucinone, glutinone, 5-epi-kutdtrioland kutdtriol were isolated from J. glutinosa as describedpreviously by us6—8) (Fig. 1). All compounds were dissolvedin dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to an appropriate concentra-tion and assayed for inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from mouse peritoneal cells andthromboxane B2 (TXB2) from human platelets. Indomethacin(25—100 mM), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (6.25—25 mM) and ibuprofen (25—100 mM) were used as referencecompounds (PGE2, LTC4 and TXB2, respectively). All chem-icals used were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (U.S.A.).Cell Viability Cell viability was assessed by using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT)-based colorimetric assay.12) Cells in 96-well plates(83105 cells/well) were exposed to various concentrations ofsamples at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air for 3 h. The 20 m l MTT so-lution (5 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline) was added andfurther incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After aspirating the super-natant from the wells, 100 m l of DMSO were added for thedissolution of formazan crystals. The absorbance of each wellwas then read at 520 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay (ELISA) plate reader. The values of the maximumnon-toxic concentration obtained were then used in PGE2,LTC4 and TXB2 determinations.Preparation of Mouse Peritoneal Cells Cells fromNMRI male mice (2065 g) were collected by peritoneallavage with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). PBS was in-jected into the peritoneum and the cavity was gently mas-1∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: naber@farm.ucm.esSesquiterpenes from Jasonia glutinosa: In Vitro Anti-inflammatoryActivityPaulina BERMEJO BENITO,*,a María José ABAD,a Ana María DÍAZ,b Lucinda VILLAESCUSA,bMaría Angeles GONZÁLEZ,b and Ana María SILVÁNaDepartment of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Complutense,a 28040 Madrid, Spain and Department ofPharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Alcala,b Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.Received December 11, 2000; accepted September 6, 2001Four sesquiterpenes isolated from Jasonia glutinosa D.C. (Asteraceae), namely lucinone, glutinone, 5-epi-kutdtriol and kutdtriol, have been evaluated for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in cellular systems gen-erating cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolites. None of the compounds assayed had asignificant effect on leukotriene C4 (LTC4)-release from calcium ionophore-stimulated mouse peritoneal cells.However, the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by mouse peritoneal cells stimulated with calcium ionophorewas inhibited by these compounds, although with less potency than the reference drug indomethacin(IC5050.24 mM). The IC50 values of the active compounds were: lucinone 42.69 mM, glutinone 3.61 mM, 5-epi-kut-dtriol 1.28 mM and kutdtriol 39 mM. Of the tested compounds, only glutinone (IC50524 mM) showed a significanteffect on thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-release induced by calcium ionophore in human platelets, although with lesspotency than the reference drug ibuprofen (IC5051.27 mM).Key words Jasonia glutinosa; sesquiterpene; PGE2; LTC4; TXB2Fig. 1. Chemical Structures of Sesquiterpenes Isolated from Jasonia gluti-nosasaged for 1 min. The lavage fluid was aspirated and the cellswere isolated by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). Thesupernatant was decanted and the cells were counted and re-suspended at 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’smedium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivatedfetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Barcelona, Spain)for cells adhered to 24-well plates. For adhering to plates, cellswere incubated 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.PGE2 and LTC4 Release Assay COX and 5-LOX prod-uct formation was studied in calcium ionophore A23187stimulated mouse peritoneal cells, consisting mainly ofmouse peritoneal macrophages. This system had been opti-mized for maximal PGE2 and LTC4 release.13) Mouse peri-toneal cells were prepared in 24-well plates with the cell den-sity of 53105 cells/well for the determination of PGE2 andLTC4. After adhering to plates, nonadherent cells werewashed off, and fresh DMEM (without FCS) added. Thecells were pre-incubated with each test compound for 60 minat 37 °C. Then, calcium ionophore A23187 was added at afinal concentration of 1026 M and further incubated for 2 h.The contents of all dishes were collected directly from theplates, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min.PGE2 and LTC4 in the supernatant of each reaction mixturewere quantitated by an ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical Co.,U.S.A.).Preparation of Human Platelets Peripheral blood sam-ples were obtained from healthy donors of both sexes and an-ticoagulated with EDTA. Blood was centrifuged at 900 rpmfor 20 min at 20 °C, and the upper straw-coloured suspensionof platelet-rich plasma (PRP) retained. The cells were resus-pended in PBS at 33108 platelets/ml.TXB2 Release Assay COX product formation was stud-ied in calcium ionophore A23187 stimulated human plate-lets. This system had been optimized for maximal TXB2 re-lease.14) Aliquots of PRP (1.53108 platelets/sample) werepre-incubated with each test compound for 2 min at 37 °C.Then, calcium ionophore A23187 was added at a final con-centration 1.831026 M and further incubated for 20 min at25 °C. The cellular responses were stopped by centrifugationat 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. TXB2 in the supernatant ofeach reaction mixture was quantitated by an ELISA kit.Data Analysis PGE2, LTC4 and TXB2 concentrationswere assessed directly from a standard curve. Data are shownas mean6S.D. of groups of five culture dishes of at least du-plicate and in most cases triplicate determinations. Statisticalanalysis was performed using Student’s t-test for unpaireddata.RESULTSLucinone and kutdtriol did not show a cytotoxic effect oncells up to a concentration of 100 mM. Glutinone and 5-epi-kutdtriol were only weakly toxic at 50 and 100 mM, respec-tively.Effects of Sesquiterpenes on PGE2- and LTC4-ReleaseAs shown in Tables 1 and 2, stimulation of mouse peritonealcells by calcium ionophore A23187 led to the release of sub-stantial amounts of COX-1 and 5-LOX products from en-dogenous arachidonic acid (AA). Basal releases of PGE2 andLTC4 from A23187-stimulated cells were 8560.5 ng/ml and5560.6 ng/ml (mean6S.D.), respectively. Validation of thissystem for the identification of inhibitors of the two divergentpathways of arachidonate metabolism was performed usingindomethacin, a well-characterized COX inhibitor (97.18%inhibition of PGE2, IC5050.24 mM) (Table 1), and NDGA, aknown inhibitor of 5-LOX, which produced 100% inhibitionof LTC4 (IC5050.49 mM) (Table 2). All compounds assayedshowed a significant effect on PGE2-release (Table 1). Luci-none, glutinone, 5-epi-kutdtriol and kutdtriol exhibited in-hibitory activity on COX-1 with IC50 values of 42.69, 3.61,1.28 and 39 mM, respectively (Fig. 2). Inhibition was moreevident with kutdtriol, although it showed less potency thanthe reference drug. However, none of the sesquiterpenestested had a significant effect on LTC4-release (Table 2).Effects of Sesquiterpenes on TXB2-Release As shownin Table 3, stimulation of human platelets by calciumionophore A23187 led to the release of substantial amountsof COX products from endogenous AA. Basal release ofTXB2 from A23187-stimulated platelets was 92.560.3 ng/ml(mean6S.D.). Validation of this system for the identificationof inhibitors was obtained using ibuprofen as a referencedrug, which produced 98.9% inhibition of TXB2 (IC5051.27mM) (Table 3). Of all the tested compounds, only glutinone(IC50524 mM) showed a significant effect on TXB2-release,although with less potency than the reference drug (Fig. 3).DISCUSSIONThe symptoms of inflammation (redness, edema, heat,pain and disturbed tissue function) are results of complexpathophysiological processes that include increased bloodflow and vascular permeability, activation of humoral andcellular defence mechanisms, sensibilization and activationof noniceptors. These processes are mediated by a variety ofTable 1.

In the searchfor new anti-inflammatory compounds, numerous targetswithin the AA cascade have been evaluated. COX and 5-LOX are two important enzymes which catalyze the forma-tion of mediators involved in the inflammatory process.The present paper studies the in vitro activity of foursesquiterpenes of plant origin in cellular systems generatingCOX and LOX metabolites. In our experiments, we stimu-lated the COX-1 (PGE2 and TXB2) and 5-LOX (LTC4) path-way by calcium ionophore A23187 in a preparation of mouseperitoneal cells and human platelets. The four sesquiterpenestested are capable of exerting inhibitory actions on enzymesof the arachidonate cascade, although they do not interfere inthe 5-LOX pathway in our cellular systems. These com-pounds exert a preferential effect on the COX-1 pathway.Thus, glutinone exerts an inhibitory effect on the COX path-way (giving rise to reduced PGE2 levels in activated mousecells because of PG-synthase inhibition, and to a lesser ex-tent reduced TXB2 levels in human platelets), while lucinone,kutdtriol and 5-epi-kutdtriol only have a significant effect onPG-synthase activity.Our results identify some features concerning the inhibi-tion of arachidonate metabolism by sesquiterpenes. Kutdtrioland 5-epi-kutdtriol differed in terms stereochemistry. Alter-ation of the cis- to the trans-substitution at position 5 appearsTable 3.

We suggest thatthe methyl group at position 10, which was intact in the fourmolecules, is perhaps an important function for PG-synthaseactivity. Of all sesquiterpenes tested, only glutinone exhibiteda moderate inhibitory effect on TX-synthase. The presence ofan aliphatic chain at C-10 appears to be a necessary require-ment for TX-synthase activity, because when it is blocked,the effect disappears. Thus, etherification of the enol by cy-clization leads to a complete loss of activity on TXB2 (55%inhibition of glutinone versus 0% inhibition of lucinone).In the light of the obtained results, we can rule out inhibi-tion of LOX metabolism. We suggest that selective inhibitionof the PG-synthase pathway is the primary target of action ofsesquiterpenes isolated from J. glutinosa, although glutinonepresents a moderate inhibition of TX-synthase. However,since the synthesis of TXB2 from AA depends on both theactivity of COX and TX-synthase, dependent supression ofTXB2-release may be also explained by the inhibition of COXdue to glutinone. Additional studies of the inhibitory mecha-nism and the structure–activity relationship are in progress.Acknowledgements This work was supported by: Min-istry of Health (FISS Rf. 94/1671); U.A. (Rf.
