9. DISTRIBUTION OF FLAVONOID COMPOUNDS IN THE HEARTWOODS AND
BARKS OF SOME INTERRELATED WATTLES
By D. G. ROUX, E. A. MAIHS ANm E. PAULUS
Leather Industries Research In8titute, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa
(Received 22 July 1960)
The flavan-3-ols (-)-robinetinidol, (+ )-catechin
and (+)-gallocatechin occur in the bark (Roux,
1953; Roux & Maihs, 1958, 1960a), whereas
(+) - 7:3':4' -trihydroxyflavan-3:4 - diol (Keppler,
1957), (+ )-fustin, (-)-fisetinidol, fisetin and poly-
meric leuco-fisetinidin tannin (Roux & Paulus,
1961 a, b) are prominent heartwood components of
the commercially afforested black-wattle tree
[Acacia moUieima, recently renamed A. mearneji
(cf. Brenan & Melville, 1960)]. Of the four Acacia
spp. introduced into South Africa from Australia
for their tannin-rich bark, A. mearnsii is closely
related to A. decurren8 (green wattle) and to A.
dealbata (silver wattle), all having feathery com-
pound leaves of similar appearance. A. pyonantha
(golden wattle) with leaves in the form of lance-
olate phyllodes is known to be more distantly
related to this group. In the present study the
distribution of flavonoid compounds in the barks
and heartwoods of these species is compared.
EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS
All melting points are uncorrected. Mixed melting points
are performed on molecular mixtures (Roux & Maihs,
1960a). Analyses of C and H were by Weiler and Strauss,
Oxford. Infrared comparisons were by Dr J. R. Nunn,
National Chemical Research Laboratory, C.S.I.R., Pre-
toria. A 2 dm. tube was used for optical rotations. Two-
dimensional chromatograms were run in water-saturated
butan-2-ol for direction 1 and in 2% acetic acid for direc-
tion 2.
Isolation, identifreation and estimation
of heartwood components
Acacia decurrens and Acacia detilbata. On two-dimen-
sional chromatograms the methanol-soluble heartwood
components of green and silver wattles show the same
pattern of components as those present in black-wattle
(A. mearnsii) heartwood extractives. Those heartwood
components which have been isolated from black wattle,
namely (+ )-7:3':4'-trihydroxyflavan-3:4-diol, (+ )-fustin,
(- )-fisetinidol and fisetin (Roux & Paulus, 1961 a, b),
were used to identify the corresponding components in A.
decurrens and A. dealbata by means of two-dimensional

paper chromatography. The addition of the above-
mentioned compounds caused increases in the concentra-
tion of the corresponding substances in each of the two
extracts. Identity of the compounds was confirmed by
colour reactions with toluene-p-sulphonic acid, ferric alum
and bis-diazotized-benzidine spray reagents. The con-
currence of spots and colour reactions were considered as
sufficient proof of identity. Polymeric leuco-fisetinidin
taunins occurred in each heartwood.
Acacia pycnantha. Golden wattle, although related to
the above group, shows some divergent botanical charac-
teristics. The pattern of heartwood components of A.
pycnantha was almost identical with those of black, green
and silver wattles but showed slight differences. Golden-
wattle-heartwood components were accordingly isolated to
ensure their identity.
Drilings (4-3 kg.) from the dry heartwood of golden-
wattle trees from the Union Government Plantations at
Eerste River, near Cape Town, were extracted with
methanol in three successive extractions of 48 hr. duration
each, to yield 213 g. of solids. The solids were dissolved in
hot ethanol (500 ml.) and chloroform (400 ml.) was added
to precipitate tannins. The solubles (130 g.) were fraction-
ated by solution in 400 ml. of ethyl acetate-ethanol (2:1)
followed by the addition of chloroform (300 ml.) with
shaking. The solids remaining after evaporation of the
filtrate (83 g.) were resolved in a Craig machine by the
method described by Roux & Paulus (1961 b). After 160
transfers fisetin (140-160), fustin (105-135), fisetinidol
(105-125) and ( + )-7:3':4'-trihydroxyflavan-3:4-diol (44-69)
were located in the tubes indicated by means of two-
dimensional paper chromatography. The contents of the
appropriate tubes were grouped together and the com-
pounds isolated by separation on cellulose sheets as de-
scribed by Roux & Paulus (1961 a, b). Fisetin (20 mg.),
fustin (2-3 g.), fisetinidol (150 mg.) and 7:3':4'-trihydroxy-
flavan-3:4-diol (900 mg.) were obtained in a crystalline
condition.
(a) Fisetin. The solids present in tubes 141-160 were
boiled with w-H,SO and the insoluble solids extracted with
ether in a Soxhlet apparatus. The ether extractives were
recrystallized from ethanol-water; m.p. and mixed m.p.
with fisetin prepared from (+)-fustin of Rhus glabra (Roux
& Paulus, 1961 a) 320°. A 252, 320 and 360 m, in
ethanol.
(b) (+ )-Fustin. The fustin was recrystallized from water,
m.p. and mixed m.p. with (+)-fustin from A. mearn8im
(Roux & Paulus, 1961a) 214-2160. [uI1]S+21.542.20 in

chloroethane (c, 1.2). The low m.p. of the tetra-acetyl
derivative compared with that of the racemate (147-151°),
and the high optical rotations, indicate that optically pure
(+ )-fustin is present also in A. pycnantha heartwood.
(c) (- )-Fisetinidol. The fisetinidol was recrystallized
from water (charcoal), m.p. and mixed m.p. with (- )-fise-
tinidol from A. mearnsii (Roux & Paulus, 1961b) 212-
2140. [r2-4.9±0.30 in acetone-water (1:1) (c, 0.8). In
2% acetic acid on Whatman no. 1 paper the RB (0 48) of
the fisetinidol differed from that (0-43) of synthetic (+ )-
fisetinidol (Weinges, 1958), but was identical with the RF
(0 48) of synthetic (- )-fisetinidol (Roux & Paulus, 1961 b).
Paper chromatography showed that only the optically pure
(- )-form is present.
(d) (+ )-7:3':4'-Trihydroxyflavan-3:4-diol. The flavan-
3:4-diol was also isolated by running 24 g. of the soluble
fraction (after chloroform precipitation) on 60 sheets of
Whatman no. 3 paper in 2% acetic acid and cutting the
band located with the toluene-p-sulphonic acid spray
(Roux & Evelyn, 1958b). Yield, 0 7 g. The flavan-3:4-diol
was recrystallized from water, m.p. and mixed m.p. with
(+)-mollisacacidin (Keppler, 1957; Clark-Lewis & Roux,
1959) 1290. [] + 30.7 ±0.80 in acetone-water (1: 1) (c, 1 0).
The R,p (0.54) in 2% acetic acid on Whatman no. 1 paper
was identical with that of ( + )-7:3':4'-trihydroxyflavan-3:4-
diol (0 54) from A. mearn&ii (Roux & Maihs, 1960b), but
differed from the RF (0.48) of the (- )-enantiomer from
S. quebracho-colorado. Infrared-absorption curves of the
flavan-3:4-diols from A. pycnantha and A. mearnmii were
superimposable over the range 2-5-15 .
(e) Gallic acid. A compound present in tubes 64-79 of
the Craig machine was isolated by separation on cellulose
sheets (30 mg.). It gave a blue colour with ferric alum
spray, and a purple colour with the borate buffer (pH 7 7)-
methyl red spray (Kalbe, 1954), indicating that the sub-
stance contained a pyrogallol grouping and was acidic. The
compound was shown to be gallic acid by m.p. and mixed
m.p. with authentic gallic acid 250°.
E8tination of flavonoid compound8
in wattle heartwood8
Cross-sections of each of the heartwoods of black, green,
silver and golden wattles were drilled out and the drillings
were extracted with methanol (five extractions of 24 hr.
duration each at room temperature). The tree samples
were of different ages [black (10 years), green (9 years),
silver (10 years) and golden (about 30 years)] and the
sampling height above the ground is unknown.The concen-
tration of components in the methanol extract was
estimated by the paper-chromatographic-densitometric
method, ammoniacal silver nitrate being used as spray
reagent (Roux & Maihs, 1960a, b). Estimated percentages
of different components in the four heartwoods are shown
in Table 1.
I8slation, identification and e8tinmtion
of bark components
The barks of the different Acacia species show no signi-
ficant change in the composition of catechin components
with increasing age, although the proportion of carbo-
hydrate 'non-tannins' is known to decrease progressively.
The average molecular weight of the tannins in the
youngest strippable bark of A. mearneii does not, for
example, differ significantly from those in mature barks of
the same tree (Evelyn, 1956). For this work 'mature'
barks from the bases of 7-10-year-old trees were selected,
with the exception of A. pyenantha, where the specimens
were over 30 years old.
Acacia decurrens. Green-wattle-bark extract is ap-
parently identical with black wattle in the composition of
catechin components, differing only in the proportions of
catechins present (Table 2). (.- )-Robinetinidol, (+ )-cate-
chin and (+)-gallocatechin were shown to be present in
green-wattle bark extractives with the chromatographic
method described for heartwood components, and reference
substances were obtained from black-wattle bark (Roux &
Maihs, 1960a).
Acacia dealbata. Two-dimensional chromatograms of
silver-wattle-bark extractives sprayed with bis-diazotized
benzidine reagent showed the presence of ( - )-robinetinidol
(yellow), (+ )-catechin (ochre), ( +)-gallocatechin (ochre)
and of a fourth substance also giving an ochre coloration.
From its position on the chromatograms the latter was
suspected to be (- )-epicatechin. Out of ten barks, from
different trees examined, three showed the suspected
( - )-epicatechin in relatively high concentration. The con-
centration of the other catechins was relatively constant
(Table 3). The catechins were separated and identified as
follows.
A portion (470 g.) of the ethyl acetate extractives
(560 g.) of dry powdered silver-wattle bark [low in (-
epicatechin content] was soluble on re-solution in com-
mercial ethyl acetate. Tannins present in the soluble

fraction were precipitated in batches with samples (10 g.)
dissolved in 100 ml. of ethyl acetate-methanol (20: 1) and
adding 100 ml. of chloroform. The low-molecular-weight
fraction remaining in solution after removal of the pre-
cipitated tannins was 10% of the starting material.
The enriched catechin fraction (56 g.) was streaked on to
140 sheets of Whatman no. 3 chromatographic paper
(0.4 g./sheet) and the sheets were developed by upward
migration in 2% acetic acid as described by Roux &
Evelyn (1958a, b). Bands corresponding to (- )-robin-
etinidol (R, 0-54), (+ )-catechin (RF 0.48) and (- )-epi-
catechin (Rp 0-44) were located by the bis-diazotized benz-
idine reagent. The bands were cut and eluted with 70%
ethanol (Nordstrom & Swain, 1953), yielding 0-4, 5.0 and
2-2 g. of solids respectively in the eluents. The solids from
each band were streaked on prewashed (with water) sheets
of Whatman no. 3 paper (200 mg./sheet dissolved in 5 ml. of
methanol), and the chromatograms were developed down-
wards in butan-l-ol-acetic acid-water (6:1:2). Bands
were located, cut and eluted as before. From the eluents
(+ )-catechin (1-0 g.) crystallized with ease, but (- )-robin-
etinidol (40 mg.) and ( - )-epicatechin (200 mg.) were run
again in the partitioning mixture before crystallizing.
(+)-Gallocatechin (18 mg.) was obtained from the same
band (R1p 0-48 in 2 % acetic acid) in which (+ )- catechin
was present in the initial fractionation, and crystallized
after seeding with (+ )-gallocatechin crystals from golden
wattle.
(a) (- )-Robinetinidol. Robinetinidol from silver wattle
was recrystallized from water, m.p. and mixed m.p. with
(- )-robinetinidol (m.p. 2050) from black wattle 2020.

in acetone-water (1: 1) was not sufficiently clear to permit
measurements of optical rotation, but the robinetinidol

from silver wattle gave an ochre colour with bis-diazotized
benzidine spray and a blue with ferric alum spray. The
gallocatechin also migrates to the identical position with
( + )-gallocatechin on two-way chromatograms with solvent
systems which separate catechin stereoisomers (Roberts &
Wood, 1953).
(e) (-)-epiGallocatechin. Ethyl acetate-soluble silver-
wattle-bark extracts from which tannins were partly
removed by passing the aqueous solution through a column
of hide powder showed the presence of traces of a sub-
stance migrating to the same position on two-way chro-
matograms (Roberts & Wood, 1953) and giving the same
colour reactions as (- )-epigallocatechin.
Acacia pycnantha. A two-dimensional chromatogram of
the ethyl acetate extract of golden-wattle bark showed the
presence of a number of phloroglucinol-containing sub-
stances [amber colour with bis-diazotized benzidine (Roux
& Maihs, 1960 b)] in a pattern identical with that found in
the extractives of dried green tea. The known catechins of
dried green tea (Bradfield et al. 1947; Bradfield & Penney,
1948; Bradfield & Bate-Smith, 1950; Roberts & Wood,
1951, 1953) were isolated for comparison by the same
methods described below for golden wattle, but without
preliminary chloroform precipitation.
The ethyl acetate extract (230 g.) of golden-wattle bark
was redissolved in ethyl acetate and the tannins were pre-
cipitated with chloroform as for silver wattle. The resulting
soluble low-molecular-weight fraction (32 g.) was separated
on 80 sheets of Whatman no. 1 paper with 2% acetic acid.
On the dried sheets the bands were located by spraying
test strips with the benzidine reagent and by ultraviolet
light. Bands corresponding to RF values 0-56 (0 4 g.), 0-50
(2-0 g.), 0-42 (2-2 g.), 0-35 (2-8 g.) and 0 29 (4.3 g.) were cut
and eluted in 70% ethanol to give the weights of solids
indicated. The fractions contained the following main com-
ponents: RF 0-56 [(- )-robinetinidol]; RF 0-50 [(+)-cate-
chin, gallic acid, (+ )-gallocatechin]; RF 0-42 [(- )-epi-
catechin, (- )-epicatechin gallate, (- )-epigallocatechin];
RF 0-35 [(- )-epicatechin gallate, (- )-epigallocatechin
gallate, (- )-epigallocatechin]; RF 0-29 [(- )-epigallo-
catechin gallate]. Each band was separated on washed
paper sheets in a partitioning mixture as described for
silver wattle. The following substances were isolated after
recrystallization from water, and where necessary com-
pared with similar substances obtained from tea by identical
methods, and also from other sources.
(a) (- )-Robinetinidol. This compound formed less than
20% of the fraction, Rp 0-56 in 2% acetic acid. Yield,
32 mg. M.p. and mixed m.p. with (- )-robinetinidol 203-
204°. Ama.. in ethanol 282 m,u (e 3944). The compound
gives the same colour reactions (blue with ferric alum, and
yellow with bis-diazotized benzidine spray reagents) as
( - )-robinetinidol, and their optical identity was shown by
their concurrence on two-way chromatograms with the
solvent systems below: RF 0-78 in butan-l-ol-acetic acid-

Estimation of catechins in wattle bark8
Mature barks of black, silver, green and golden wattle
were exhaustively extracted with methanol (six extractions
of powdered bark of 24 hr. each at room temperature).
Each extract was spotted on two-way chromatograms,
with 4 mg. when finally spraying with the benzidine re-
agent and 6 mg. with the silver nitrate reagent. The
catechins were estimated by the densitometric method as
described by Roux & Maihs (1960a, b). The variation of
catechin components within species and in black x green
wattle hybrids is shown in Table 2, and their concentration
in the four different wattles is shown in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
The close interrelationship of A. mearn8ii, A.
decurrens and A. dealbata compared with the more
distantly related A. pyonantha is evident from a
cursory examination of their leaves. The first three
may again be differentiated into the pair A.
mearn8ii and A. decurrens, which were at one time
regarded as varietal forms of the same species (A.
deourrens), and A. dealbata which, although similar,
is further removed from the A. decurren8 group.
Comparison of known chemical components in.the
phylogenetically old and relatively unspecialized
organs, e.g. heartwoods and barks of these inter-
related Acacia spp., is of interest, especially in
view of the extensive work by Erdtman (1959) on
the 'chemical taxonomy' of coniferous plants.
The heartwoods of the four species each contain
(+ )-7:3':4'-trihydroxyflavan-3:4-diol, (+ )-fustin,
(-)-fisetinidol, fisetin and polymeric leuco-fisetini-
din tannins. The concentration of these heartwood
components in the wood is low and often variable
(Roux & Evelyn, 1960), apart from the existing
radial gradations (Roux & Paulus, 1961a, b).
Differences in the concentration of heartwood com-
ponents in different species (Table 1) are therefore
not regarded as significant. The presence of
identical components in the wattle heartwoods
apparently confirms the general interrelationship
between the four species. In the heartwood of A.
pycnantha there are traces of minor components,
e.g. gallic acid, which are not present in the A.
dealbata-A. decurrens group.
By comparison, wattle barks have high tannin
contents (17-40% on air-dry weight), with a
relatively consistent composition of catechin com-
ponents and average molecular weight of tannins
present in each species (Evelyn, 1956). In the
barks of A. mearnai and A. decurren8 identical
catechins, (-)-robinetinidol, (+ )-catechin and
(+ )-gallocatechin, are present but the concentra-
tion of (+ )-catechin and (+ )-gallocatechin appears
consistently lower (0.45-0-65% and 0-25-0-4%
respectively) in black wattles than in green wattles
(1-1-155% and 0.4-0-5% respectively). In the
black x green wattle hybrids the concentrations of
these catechins approximate to those in green
wattle (Table 2). Black wattles growing on shale
appear to have a higher concentration of ( - )-robin-
etinidol in the bark than green wattles growing
on the same type of soil (Table 2). In A. dealbata
(silver wattle) bark, (-)-epicatechin and traces of
(-)-epigallocatechin appear as additional com-
ponents, increasing the emphasis on the 'phloro-
glucinol series' of catechins present. (-)-Robin-
etinidol is present, but in much decreased concen-
tration (Table 3). In A. pycnantha the presence of
(-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate, (-)-epi-
gallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate
places even greater emphasis on the catechins of
the 'phloroglucinol series' (Table 3), whereas
(-)-robinetinidol, characteristic component of
these Acacia barks, is present in low concentration.
The isolated occurrence of gallic acid both in the
bark and heartwood of A. pyonantha is of interest.
Considering the four species in the order of their
closeness to black wattle in botanical character in
the sequence A. mearn8ii, A. decurren8, A. dealbata
and A. pyonantha, A. pycnantha has the greatest
number and total concentration of catechins of the
'phloroglucinol series' and also the lowest concen-
tration of the single catechin of the 'resorcinol
series' [(-)-robinetinidol] in the bark (Table 3).
A. dealbata has a much decreased number of
phloroglucinol catechins present in the bark, with
the resorcinol catechin still in low concentration
(Table 3). A. decurren8, closest to black wattle, has
the identical composition of known catechins in the
bark, but with those of the 'phloroglucinol series'
present in higher concentration (Table 2). Hence
the concentration and distribution of bark com-
ponents in these Acacias species agree with the
accepted systematics.
The isolation of (+ )-catechin, (-)-epicatechin,
(-)-epicatechin gallate, (+ )-gallocatechin, (-)-
epigallocatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and
gallic acid from the bark of A. pyonantha is of
interest in view of the presence of the identical
mixture of compounds in dried green-tea leaves
(Bradfield et al. 1947; Bradfield & Penney, 1948;
Bradfield & Bate-Smith, 1950). In golden wattle,

however, the catechins are present as minor com-
ponents associated with high-molecular-weight
tannins, whereas in tea leaves they form the major
phenolic components.
SUMMARY
1. The distribution of flavonoid compounds in
the heartwoods and barks of four wattles (Accacia
spp.) has been studied.
2. (-)-Fisetinidol, (+ )-fustin, (+ )-7:3':4'-tri-
hydroxyflavan-3:4-diol, fisetin and polymeric leuco-
fisetinidin tannins are common components to the
heartwoods of A. mearn*ii (A. mwlli8A?ma) (black
wattle), A. decurrens (green wattle), A. dealbata
(silver wattle) and A. pycnantha (golden wattle).
3. The barks of A. mearn2ii and A. decurrens
contain (-)-robinetinidol, (+ )-catechin and (+ )-
gallocatechin; A. dealbata contains these catechins
together with (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallo-
catechin, and A. pyonantha contains these together
with (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate,
(-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate
and gallic acid.
4. The possible significance of the relative distri-
bution of heartwood and bark components to the
taxonomy of these wattles is discussed.

A Method for the Identification of the Immediate
Product of Decarboxylation Reactions
BY R. F. PALMER*
Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutic8, University of Florida, Gaine8ville, Florida, U.S.A.
(Received 12 May 1960)
Under most physiological conditions the state of
an enzymic decarboxylation product as bicarbon-
ate ion, carbonic acid or carbon dioxide is deter.
mined mainly by local conditions of pH and gas
concentration. The fact that the immediate end
product of a decarboxylation reaction may actually
be any one of the three forms would be masked by
its rapid conversion into a form demanded by the
buffer and gas composition of the medium. This
conversion is rapid in systems where carbonic
anhydrase is present. It has therefore been difficult
with conventional methods to determIine the
immediate reaction product in carbon dioxide-
producing systems.
