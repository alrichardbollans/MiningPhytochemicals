oronary artery disease induced by atherosclerosis is one of
themajorcausesofdeath inthe Western world.
1Onemajor
pathological change associated with atherosclerosis is thickening
of the arterial wall and progressive narrowing of the arterial
lumen,leadingtoinsuﬃcientbloodﬂow.Proliferationofvascular
smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the intima layer of the arterial
wall is one of the major components of the narrowing process,
besides ongoing inﬂammatory processes.
2 There are already
several pharmaceuticals used to combat pathological VSMC
proliferation, but their action is not optimal due to long-term
side eﬀects. Therefore, there is still a need to identify new active
compounds.
3,4
Natural products represent an excellent resource for the
identiﬁcation of new lead structures.
5 Austria and its adjacent
regions have a rich history in traditional folk medicine. In order to
conserve this ethnopharmacological knowledge, the VOLKSMED
database was created.
6 Since inﬂammation is associated with very
diverse pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, plants
used traditionally to treat inﬂammatory conditions were retrieved
from the VOLKSMED database. In an ongoing screening program,
extracts of these plants were tested for their ability to inhibit VSMC
proliferation. This bioactivity screening procedure revealed an
activityofthedichloromethane(CH2Cl2) extractfromPeucedanum
ostruthium (L.) WDJ Koch (Apiaceae) rhizomes. Peucedanum
species, especially the rhizomes of P. ostruthium, have a long history
in Austrian traditional medicine for the treatment of inﬂammatory
diseases.Furthermore,ananti-inﬂammatoryactionofaP.ostruthium

To test whether the CH2Cl2 extract of P. ostruthium rhizomes
concentration dependently inhibits serum (10%)-induced pro-
liferation of rat aortic VSMC, this extract was applied at
concentrations of 3 to 30 μg/mL (Figure 1), and resazurin
conversion after 48 h was measured.

ABSTRACT:Inhibitionofvascularsmoothmusclecell(VSMC)
proliferation is of substantial interest in combating cardiovascular
disease. A dichloromethane extract from the rhizomes of Peuce-
danum ostruthium, a traditionally used Austrian medicinal plant
with anti-inﬂammatory properties, was examined for a putative
antiproliferative activityinrataorticVSMC.Thisextractinhibited
serum (10%)-induced VSMC proliferation concentration depen-
dently. Further identiﬁcation and biological testing of its major
constituentsrevealedthatthecoumarinostruthin(7)i st h em a j o r
antiproliferative substance. In summary, a new bioactivity of P.
ostruthium rhizomes is described, and 7 has been identiﬁed as the responsible compound.1514 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200072a |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1513–1516

P. ostruthium rhizomes inhibits the proliferation of VSMC with
an IC50 value of 24 ( 14 μg/mL.
It has been reported previously that coumarins are major
bioactive constituents of extracts from P. ostruthium rhizomes.
7,9
Furthermore, in a parallel study, we have performed a comprehen-
sivequalitativeandquantitativeanalysisofthemaincoumarins
in extracts from P. ostruthium rhizomes.
10 High-performance
liquid chromatography diode-arraydetection massspectrometry
(HPLC-DAD-MS) proﬁling of the CH2Cl2 extract investigated in
this study (Figure 2) led to the identiﬁcation of seven coumarins as
major constituents (1 7). The total coumarin content in this
CH2Cl2extractwasdeterminedtobe78%,whereasthecontentper
gram dry weight of plant material was 6%. Ostruthin (7)w a s
quantiﬁed as the main coumarin (41% of the total coumarin
content), followed by oxypeucedanin (2, 18%), ostruthol (3,
13%), imperatorin (4, 12%), isoimperatorin (6, 9%), oxypeuceda-
nin hydrate (1,6 % ) ,a n do s t h o l e( 5,1 % ) .
After the identiﬁcation of the seven major coumarin consti-
tuents of the CH2Cl2 extract of P. ostruthium rhizomes, their
individual antiproliferative activities in serum-stimulated VSMC
were investigated. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 6 were obtained
from commercial sources. Ostruthol (3) and ostruthin (7) were
isolated by preparative HPLC, the identity was conﬁrmed by
massspectrometryand1Dand2DNMRspectroscopy,andtheir
puritywasshowntobe>98%byHPLC-DAD,HPLC-ELSD,and
NMR. Compounds 1 7 were all applied at 30 μM, but only 7
exhibited signiﬁcant antiproliferative activity (Figure 3). Since 7
was the main compound in the extract (Figure 2), as well as the
most active among the seven major constituents (Figure 3), it is
concluded that 7 is the major active compound in the CH2Cl2
extract of P. ostruthium rhizomes inhibiting VSMC proliferation.
Furthermore, 7 constitutes around 32% of the total extract. The
IC50 value determined for the CH2Cl2 extract, i.e., 24 μg/mL,
corresponds to about 26 μMo f7. Since 7 inhibited VSMC
proliferation with an IC50 of 11 ( 2 μM, its activity can entirely
explain the inhibitory properties of the plant crude extract.
The resazurin assay method used is based on the metabolic
conversion of resazurin to the ﬂuorescent resoruﬁn, which
correlates to the cell number. To validate the potential of 7 to
inhibit VSMC proliferation, the rate of de novo DNA synthesis
via BrdU incorporation was measured (Figure 4). As expected,
ostruthin concentration dependently inhibited the serum-in-
duced DNA synthesis, with an IC50 of 17 ( 6 μM. Furthermore,
the IC50 value at which the CH2Cl2 extract inhibited DNA
synthesis was 18 ( 4 μg/mL. Since 18 μg/mL extract solution
corresponds to 19 μM ostruthin, the DNA synthesis inhibitory
propertiesoftheplantcrudeextractcanalsobeentirelyexplained
by that single chemical constituent. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
the cell viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion test was
detected in the presence of ostruthin in the used concentration
range, with a cell viability of 98 ( 2% and 92 ( 6% for the
untreated and ostruthin (30 μM)-treated cells, respectively
(mean ( SD, n =4 ,p > 0.05, Student’s t test).
An antiproliferative action of 7 in VSMC has not been
reported before. However, one study examined an antiprolifera-
tive action (IC50 of 13.6 ( 1.8 μM) of the structurally similar
osthole (5) isolated from Angelica pubescens in the smooth
muscle cell line A10.

tested for an antiproliferative action on VSMC utilizing the resazurin
conversion method. All compounds were tested in a concentration of
30 μM. Ostruthin (7) was the only compound signiﬁcantly inhibiting
serum-stimulated VSMC proliferation (mean ( SD, n =3 ,* p < 0.05;

that the geranyl group at the C-6 position may be necessary for
the inhibitory eﬀect. To validate this speciﬁce ﬀect of the geranyl
group, the inhibitory potential for several further coumarins and
furanocoumarins was tested, namely, auraptene, bergamottin,
bergapten, bergaptol, heraclenin, isobergapten, isopimpinellin,
scopoletin, and umbelliferone (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting
Information), which all share some structural similarity to 7, but
lack the C-6 geranyl group. Indeed, none of these compounds
signiﬁcantly inhibited VSMC proliferation at a concentration of
30 μM, underlining the speciﬁc action of 7, among the com-
pounds tested.

Cell Culture. VSMC from thoracic aortas of Sprague Dawley rats
were kindly provided by Dr. Kathy K. Griendling (Emory University,
Atlanta, GA). VSMC were grown and seeded at the indicated density in
DMEM containing glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% calf
serum. Basic cellparameters were checked routinely usingacell viability
analyzer (ViCell, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and cell passages 5 to 15
were used for the experiments.
PlantMaterial.P.ostruthiumrhizomeswerepurchasedfromKottas
Pharma GmbH, Vienna, Austria (collected in 2008, batch: KLA70807).
The species identity of the plant material was authenticated macro-
scopicallyandmicroscopicallybyoneoftheauthors(J.S.),andchemical
fingerprinting was done by TLC and HPLC-DAD-MS. A voucher
specimen is deposited at the Department of Pharmacognosy, University
of Vienna, Austria (number: Po001).
ExtractionandIsolationofOstruthol(3)andOstruthin(7).
The dried and powdered roots of P. ostruthium (367.5 g) were extracted
with CH2Cl2 and subsequently with MeOH using an ASE200 acceler-
ated solvent extractor (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The instrument
was equipped with 22 mL stainless steel extraction cells and 60 mL glass
collectionbottles.Threeextractioncycleswith5minheat-uptime,2min
static time, 10% flush volume, and 60 s nitrogen purge were used.
Extractionwasdoneat40 Cand150bar.Weobtained37.8gofCH2Cl2
extract and 81.2 g from the MeOH extract. From the MeOH extract,
tannins were depleted using a method published by Wall et al.
12 A 2.3 g
amount of the detannified MeOH extract was then further fractionated
by solid-phase extraction on a 60 cm
3 Bond Elut C18 cartridge (Varian,
Harbor City, CA) eluted with solutions of30%, 70%, and 100% MeOH.
A 181 mg amount of the 30% MeOH subfraction, 925 mg of the 70%
MeOH subfraction, and 716 mg of the 100% MeOH SPE subfraction
were obtained. A 420 mg aliquot of the 70% MeOH subfraction was
separated by preparative HPLC using an instrument from Shimadzu
(LC-8A)withanautosampler(SIL-10AP),adiodearraydetector(SPD-
M20A9), andafractioncollector (FRC-10A). Chromatographic separa-

Briefly, analytical HPLC separation was performed on an Acclaim C18
reversed-phase column from Dionex (2.1   150 mm, 3 μm) at 38  C
and a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with a water (A) and acetonitrile (B)
gradient containing 0.01% acetic acid. The gradient was 25 37% B in
6 min, 37 45% B in 8 min, 45 65% B in 10 min, 65 95% B in 1 min,
and isocratic at 95% B for 5 min. Tentative identification of the main
coumarins was facilitated by HPLC-DAD-MS in an automated data-
dependent acquisition mode. These analyses were performed on an
UltiMate 3000 RSLC-series system (Dionex, Germering, Germany)
coupled to a 3D quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with
an orthogonal ESIsource(HCT, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
The identity of 1, 2, and 4 6 was confirmed by comparison of their
retention times and UV spectra with authentic references.
10 The main
coumarins were quantified by a validated HPLC-DAD method at a
detectionwavelengthof310nmwithimperatorinasexternalstandard.A
Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system was used for these analyses.
Resazurin Conversion Assay. The assay is based on the meta-
bolic conversion of resazurin to fluorescent resorufin, which correlates
with cell number.
8 Cells were seeded in transparent 96-well plates (1

4 cells/well), serum-starved for 24 h, pretreated with the indicated
concentrations of the respective samples or vehicle for 30 min, and
subsequentlystimulatedfor48hwithcalfserum(10%).Then,cellswere
washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM containing 10 μg/mL

DNA synthesis, 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was de-
termined using a cell proliferation kit (Roche Diagnostics) as previously
described.
16 Briefly, VSMC were seeded into black (transparent flat
bottom) 96-well plates (1   10
4 cells/well), serum-starved for 24 h,
pretreated with test samples or vehicle (0.1% final concentration of DMSO
in all samples) for 30 min, and subsequently stimulated with calf serum
(10%). After 30 min, BrdU (10 μM) was added, and the cells were
cultivated for another 20 h. Afterward, cells were fixed and stained with an
enzyme-coupled anti-BrdU antibody according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Relative light units were determined using a 96-well plate
reader (Tecan GENios Pro; Tecan Group Ltd., M€ annedorf, Switzerland).
Trypan Blue Exclusion Test. The trypan blue viability test is based
on the principle that living cells possess intact cell membranes that are not
permeable to the trypan blue dye, whereas dead cells have disrupted
membrane integrity and in the presence of the dye are colored blue. To
assessthecellviability,VSMCwereseededinsix-wellplates(1 10

well), serum starved for 24 h, pretreated with ostruthin for 30 min, and
subsequentlystimulatedwithcalfserum(10%).Theviabilityofthecellswas
assessed 24 h later by trypan blue exclusion utilizing an automated cell
viability analyzer (ViCell, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).
Statistical Analysis. Data were evaluated as means ( standard
deviation from at least three independent experiments. IC50 values were
determined by nonlinear regression using Data Analysis Toolbox soft-
ware (MDL Information Systems Inc., Nashville, TN). Statistical
significance was determined by ANOVA using Tukey post hoc test,
and the results with p < 0.05 were considered significant.
