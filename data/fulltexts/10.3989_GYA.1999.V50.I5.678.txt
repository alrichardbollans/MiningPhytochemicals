1. INTRODUCTION 
Evonimus japonicus L from fam. Celastraceae, 
Piracantha coccinea L and Amelancliier cannadensis 
L, both belonging to Rosaceae family are widely 
grown as ornamental plants in Bulgaria. The fruits of 
Evonimus japonicus L are used in traditional 
medicine and the seeds are employed to obtain oil 
for technical purposes. The fruits of Piracantha 
coccinea L and Ameianchier cannadensis L contain 
a significant amount of carbohydrates (about 10,0%) 
and vitamin C (400 - 500 mg/kg) and are used as a 
source of preparation of jam, fruit wine etc. (Stoianov 
and Kitanov, 1960). However, knowledge of the 
nature and content of lipid constituents present in the 
seeds is still fragmentary. On the other hand, the 
information about the content composition of 
triacylglycerols, phospholipids, sterols and tocopherols 
is interesting from the scientifical and practical point 
of view. In the present investigation we have 
attempted to characterise the fatty acid composition 
of the triacylglycerols, the content and composition of 
the above mentioned biological active components of 
the oils. 
SUMMARY 
Lipid c o m p o s i t i o n of Evonimus japonicus L., 
Piracantha coccinea L. and Ameianchier cannadensis L. 
seed oils. 
The seeds of Evonimus japonicus L., Piracantha coccinea L 
and Ameianchier cannadensis L. contained 45.4%, 3.7% and 7.2% 
oil respectively. Oleic, linoleic and palmitic acids predominated in 
the triacylglycerols. The content of phospholipids in the oils, mainly 
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine 
and phosphatidic acids was 1.1%, 7.5% and 2.8% respectively. 
The sterols amounts were found to be 0.4% in Evonimus japonicus 
L. oil, 0.6% in Piracantha coccinea L. oil and 0.9% in Ameianchier 
cannadensis L. oil. p-Sitosterol was the main component in all oils. 
Campesterol, st igmasterol, brassicasterol, cholesterol, 
A^-st igmasterol, A^'^^-stigmasterol, A^-avenasterol and 
A^-avenasterol were identified in small quantities too. All of the 
tocopherols were identified in the oils.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Material 
Fruit material. The fruits of the investigated 
plants were obtained from the Plovdiv region in 
South Bulgaria, crop 1996. 
Methods 
The fruits were dried, milled and extracted in 
Soxhiet apparatus with n-hexane for 8 h. After 
removing of the solvent under reduced pressure in a 
rotary film evaporator the extracted oils were 
weighed. 
Fatty acid! composition. The fatty acid composition 
of triacylglycerols was determined by gas liquid

chromatography of their methyl esters. The 
esterification was carried out by Metcalfe and Wang 
technique (1981). The methyl esters were purified by 
thin layer chromatography (TLC) on plates covered 
with Silica gel 60 G «Merck» and mobile phase 
n-hexan: diethyl ether 97:3. The determination was 
performed on a HP 5890 A unit provided with FID and 
30 m capillar column «Innowax» impregnation 
(Scotia Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Carlisle, UK) and 
conditions as follows: 
- column temperature 165 - 225 °C, 4 °C/min. 
- detector temperature 320 °C, injector temperature 
300 °C 
- gas carrier - nitrogen 
The peaks were identified using authentic fatty 
acid methyl esters as standards. The area 
percentages were considered as weight 
percentages. 
Phospholipid composition. The lipids were 
extracted from the seeds by Folch procedure (1957). 
The polar lipids were divided from the unpolar lipids 
by column chromatography (Kates, 1972). The 
phospholipid constituents were separated by 
two-directional thin-layer chromatography on Silica 
gel 60 G «Merck», impregnated with 1% (NH4) 2SO4 
water solution (Beshkov, 1972). The first direction 
was carried out in chloroform:methanol:ammonia 
65:25:5 v/v/v and second in chloroform:methanol: 
ammonia:acetic acid:water 50:20:10:10:5 v/v/v/v/v 
The spots of the separated individual phospholipids 
were identified by spraing with specific reagents 
(Kates 1972). In addition Rf and standard were used 
for definitive identification. The quantitative evaluation 
was carried out spectrophotometrically at 700 nm on 
the base of free phosphorus after mineralisation with 
perchloric acid: sulphuric acid 1:1 (Beshkov, 1972). 
Sterol composition. The free sterols and sterol 
esters were separated from the other oil constituents 
by preparative TLC on Silica gel 60 G «Merck» and 
mobile phase n-hexane:diethyl ether 1:1. The sterol 
esters were saponified with ethanolic KOH, extracted 
and purified by TLC. The evaluation of the general 
content of both sterol fractions was carried out 
spectrophotometrically at 597 nm. The quantity of 
sterols was valued on base of standard solution. 
(lvanov,1972). The individual composition was 
identified by gas chromatography, using HP 5890 A 
unit with FID, 25 capillar column impregnated with 
OV-17 and conditions as follows: 
- column temperature 260 - 300 °C, 6 °C/min 
- detector temperature 320 °C, injector temperature 
300 °C 
- gas carrier - nitrogen 
The identification was confirmed by comparing 
the retention time of the individual constituents with 
those of the authentic samples. 
Tocopherol composition. Tocopherols and 
tocotrienols were analysed directly in the oils by 
H PLC with fluorescence detection (ISO 1989, 
lvanov,1995). «Merck-Hitachi» unit fitted with column 
«Nucleosil» Si 50-5 250 x 4 mm provided with 
Fluorescent detector «Merck-Hitachi» F 1000 was 
used. The operating conditions were as follows: X 
exc 295, X em 330 nm, mobile phase n-hexane: 
dioxane 94:4, rate of mobile phase 1 ml/min. The 
peaks were identified using authentic individual 
tocopherols and tocotrienols as standards. 
All values are average from three parallel 
determinations. 
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The data about the general composition of the investigated 
samples presented in Table I showed that Evonimus 
japonicus L fruits were found to be the richest in 
vegetable oil: 45,8% in the dried seeds. The highest 
content of phospholipids (7,5%) was observed in the oil 
of Piracantha coccínea L The content of tocopherols 
and tocotrienols in all of the oils was unsignificant - from 
8,3 mg/kg in Evonimus japonicus L seed oil to 13,9 
mg/kg in Amelanchier cannadensis L seed oil. Similar 
quantities of sterols (0,4-0,9%) were detected in the oils. 
Fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols is given 
in Table II. The qualitative fatty acid composition was 
similar in all investigated oils. In the samples of fatty 
acid methyl esters a total of 79,8%, 80,0% and 
73,8% respectively of unsaturated fatty acids was 
determined. The percentage of essential fatty acids 
was 30,1%, 49,3% and 36,9% for the three oils, 
respectively. Oleic acid (27,5 - 47,8%) and linoleic 
acid (23,3 - 30,2%) were the main unsaturated acids. 
A considerable percentage of palmitoleic acid (9,4%) 
was detected in Amelanchier cannadensis L oil. 
Palmitic acid predominated as the main saturated 
fatty acid (13,4 - 23,1%). The fatty acids 14:0, 17:0, 
18:0, 20:0, 20:1, 22:0 and 22:1 were identified in 
separate oils in quantities less than 1,0%. 
The qualitative analysis based on response to 
specific spray reagents on thin layer chromatography 
and comparison with authentic samples indicated the 
presence of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, 
phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acids 
as major phospholipids in all three oils (Table III). 
Lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, 
mono- and di-phosphatidylglycerols were also detected. 
Evonimus japonicus L Phosphatidylserine was 
identified in L. oil only. Phosphatidylcholine predominated 
in all phospho-lipid fractions: 40,5% in Evonimus japonicus 
L, 33,3% in Piracantha coccínea L and 31,4% in 
Amelandiiercannadensis L, followed by phosphatidylinositol: 
32,2%, 22,2% and 23,7% respectively Asignificant amount 
of phosphatidic acids were estimated in all of the oils.The 
other phospholipids were presented in negligible 
quantities.

The coinposition of free sterols an(d esterifie(d 
sterols of the investigate(j oils is presented in 
Table IV. As it is shown in the Table, the major 
part of the sterols - 87,1% in Evonimus japonicus 
L., 81,0% in Piracantha coccinea L. and 70,8% 
in Amelancliier cannadensis L. seed oils occur 
as free sterols. 
In the sterol fraction at least 9 constituents were 
presented in all oils. p-Sitosterol predominated in 
both free and esterified sterols. Their content was 
ranged from 71,8% in Amelancliier cannadensis L 
to 95,9% in Piracantlna coccinea L followed by 
stigmasterol, campesterol and A^-avenasterol. More 
considerable amounts of campesterol, brassicasterol, 
stigmasterol and A^-avenasterol were identified in 
the Amelancliier cannadensis oil. A^'^^-stigmasterol 
was identified in Evonimus japonicus L only. 
Marked differences in the quantitative composition 
between free and esterified sterols were not 
observed. 
The tocopherol and tocotrienol composition of the 
oils is shown in Table V. ô-Tocotrienol was not 
detected in any of the samples and it was not 
included in the Table. 
a-Tocopherol - 58,2% was the predominant 
component in Piracantlna coccinea L., followed 
by (3-tocopherol - 31,4%. The other tocopherols 
and tocotrienols were presented in small 
quantities. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition 
of the tocopherols of Evonimus japonicus L. 
seed oil was simmilar to that of Amelanchier 
cannadensis L. oil. It was established that the 
amounts of a-, p-, y , S-tocopherols were closed 
in both oils. 
In Evonicus japonicus L oil was established a 
significant presence of unsaturated a and y tocotrienols 
- 8,3% and 21,1% respectively. Amelanchier 
cannadensis L oil contained a-tocotrienol 23,6% and 
p-tocotrienol 17,0%. Tocopherols predominated in all 
tocopherol fractions: the ratio tocopherols: 
tocotrienols was 70,5:29,5, 92,1:7,9 and 59,4:40,6 
respectively.
