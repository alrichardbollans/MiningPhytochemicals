Although theTTLs are believed to be responsible for some of these effects, the specific interactions withtargets in the central nervous system remain to be elucidated on a molecular level. Ginkgolidesare known antagonists of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor. Herein, we describethe first examination of the binding of native TTLs and their derivatives to the cloned PAFreceptor, confirming that of the TTLs, ginkgolide B is the most potent PAF receptor antagonist.Ginkgolide derivatives carrying photoactivatable and fluorescent groups for the purpose ofperforming photolabeling have been prepared and evaluated using the cloned PAF receptor.These studies have shown that ginkgolide derivatives with aromatic photoactivatable substit-uents are potent PAF receptor antagonists with Ki values of 0.09-0.79 íM and hence excellentligands for clarifying the binding of ginkgolides to PAF receptor by photolabeling studies.Ginkgolide derivatives incorporating both fluorescent and photoactivatable groups still retainedbinding affinity to the PAF receptor and hence should be promising ligands for photolabelingand subsequent sequencing studies.IntroductionGinkgo biloba L., the last surviving member of afamily of trees (Ginkgoacea) that appeared more than250 million years ago, has been mentioned in theChinese Materia Medica for more than 2500 years.1 Anumber of G. biloba natural products have been iso-lated,2 the most unique being the terpene trilactones(TTLs), i.e., ginkgolides A, B, C, J, and M (1-5) andbilobalide (6) (Figure 1).3-6 The ginkgolides are diter-penes with a cage skeleton consisting of six five-membered rings, i.e., a spiro[4.4]nonane carbocycle,three lactones, and a tetrahydrofuran (THF). The dif-ference between the five ginkgolides lies in the variationin the number and positions of hydroxyl groups on thespirononane framework (Figure 1).A standardized G. biloba extract (EGb 761) containingTTLs (5-7%) and flavonoids (22-24%) has demon-strated neuromodulatory properties,7 and several clini-cal studies using EGb 761 have reported positive effectson various neurodegenerative diseases,8-13 includingAlzheimer’s disease (AD).14,15 A recent study by Schultzand co-workers found that EGb 761 upregulated severalgenes in rat hippocampus and cortex, including genesexpressing proteins such as transthyretin and neuronaltyrosine/threonine phosphatase, both of which are be-lieved to be involved in AD.16 Several recent studies onhealthy volunteers have shown positive effects of EGb761 on short-term working memory indicating thatconstituents of G. biloba also influence the brain underphysiological conditions.17-20Although the molecular basis for the action of G.biloba TTL constituents on the central nervous system(CNS) is only poorly understood, it is known that theginkgolides, particularly ginkgolide B (GB, 2), is apotent in vitro antagonist of the platelet-activatingfactor receptor (PAFR).21 PAF (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Figure 2) is a phospholipidmediator involved in numerous disorders includingacute allergy, inflammation, asthma, and ischemicinjury. These effects are manifested through binding ofPAF to the PAFR, a G protein-coupled receptor that isfound in organs such as the lungs, liver, kidneys,22-24and brain.25,26 The function of PAF in the brain is stillnot clear, although PAF has been suggested to play arole in diseases of aging27 and in initiating humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related neuropathogen-esis.28 PAF has also been suggested as a retrograde* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, it is still unclearwhether the neuromodulatory effect of TTLs or G. bilobaextract is related to the PAFR.33,34With few exceptions, previous structure-activityrelationship (SAR) studies of TTLs on the PAFR havefocused almost entirely on derivatives of GB (2). In allcases, the derivatives were evaluated for their abilityto prevent PAF-induced aggregation of rabbit platelets.Corey et al. investigated various intermediates encoun-tered during the course of the total syntheses ofginkgolide A (GA, 1),35 GB (2),36 and bilobalide (BB, 6)37and found that although the terminal methyl-bearinglactone was not essential for activity and could bereplaced by other lipophilic groups,38 the tert-butylgroup was important for PAFR antagonism.39 Park etal. synthesized over 200 derivatives of GB (2), withparticular focus on aromatic substituents at 10-OH, andfound most of them to be more potent than the parentcompound.40 Similar derivatives recently synthesized byHu et al. also yielded compounds more potent than GB(2),41,42 whereas other variations in GA (1) and GB (2)led to a decrease in activity.43,44In the following, we describe the first evaluation ofthe interaction of all native ginkgolides and bilobalidewith the cloned PAFR by a radioligand binding assay,as well as their functional properties by intracellularcalcium measurements. A series of ginkgolide deriva-tives with photoactivatable and fluorescent groups havebeen prepared, and these analogues have been assessedfor their ability to displace radioligand binding to clonedPAFR.ResultsSynthesis. A series of photoactivatable GB (2) andginkgolide C (GC, 3) derivatives were designed basedon previous SAR studies of ginkgolides, which demon-strated that bulky aromatic substituents in the 10-OHposition of GB (2) increase activity at the PAFR.40-42Three different photoactivatable moieties, benzophe-none, trifluoromethyldiazirine, and tetrafluorophenylazide, were chosen as they have been described as beingamong the most successful for labeling receptors andenzymes.45-47 Most importantly, upon irradiation, thesephotoactivatable groups react with the receptor viadifferent intermediates, namely, a radical, a carbene,or a (singlet) nitrene for the benzophenone, trifluoro-methyldiazirine, and tetrafluorophenyl azide moieties,respectively.45 Because it is essentially impossible topredict which group will be most readily incorporatedinto the receptor, use of these different groups increasesthe likelihood of a successful incorporation.4-(Bromomethyl)benzophenone was commercially avail-able, whereas trifluoromethyldiazirine 1248,49 and tet-rafluorophenyl azide 1550-52 were synthesized, respec-tively, as outlined in Scheme 1. The bromotrifluoro-methyldiazirine 12 was synthesized starting from readilyavailable 4-bromotoluene, which was reacted with N-trifluoroacetylpiperidine48 to give trifluoroacetyl toluene7. The trifluoroacetyl compound 7 was then reacted withhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine to form oxime8. Reacting the latter with p-toluenesulfonyl chlorideled to the tosylated oxime 9, which was placed in a thick-walled screw-capped flask and reacted overnight withliquid ammonia in diethyl ether to form the diaziridine10; under dim red light, diaziridine 10 was oxidized withiodine to give methylphenyl-trifluoromethyl-diazirine11. Finally, 11 was brominated with N-bromosuccinim-ide (NBS) using a catalytic amount of 2,2′-azobisisobu-tyronitrile (AIBN) to form 3-(4-bromomethylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirine (12, Scheme 1). Benzoylperoxide was initially used as a radical initiator, butthe reaction yielded multiple products resulting frommultiple bromine substitutions. The use of AIBN led toa 4:1 ratio of monobromiated 12 and geminal dibromo-substituted methylphenyl-trifluoromethyldiazirine, butFigure 2. Structures of PAF, the endogenous ligand for thePAFR, and WEB 2086, a potent and selective antagonist, bothof which have been used in radioligand binding studies.Scheme 1aa Reagents: (a) N-Trifluoroacetylpiperidine, n-butyllithium.

Because pentafluorophe-nyl groups that contain electron-withdrawing groupsundergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution regioselec-tively in the para position, azidophenylaldehyde 13 wasobtained in high yield, and no ortho-substituted productwas observed. Aldehyde 13 was selectively reduced witha dimethylamine-borane complex to form the benzylalcohol 14. The benzyl alcohol 14 was then brominatedby refluxing with phosphorus tribromide in pyridine andchloroform to give the desired product 15 (Scheme 1).Preparation of GB and GC derivatives 16-21 wasperformed by reacting GB (2) and GC (3) with 4-(bro-momethyl)benzophenone, 3-(4-bromomethylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirine (12), and 1-azido-4-(bro-momethyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene (15), respectively(Scheme 2). Ginkgolides GB (2) and GC (3) werederivatized almost exclusively at 10-OH when potas-sium hydride (KH) was used as base, as was previouslyshown for GB (2),40 whereas other bases were lessselective, giving rise to products derivatized at 1-OH aswell. It is noteworthy that 7-OH present in GC (3) doesnot react under any of the above-mentioned reactionconditions. Generally, the position of the substituentwas determined from the 1H NMR coupling of appropri-ate protons in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6, as wellas by correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectra. Therelative chemical shift of 12-H in DMSO-d6 can also beused in differentiating 1- and 10-OH substitutions.42The coupling of GB (2) with 4-benzoylbenzoic acidusing 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimideHCl (EDC) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP)occurred exclusively at 10-OH to give 10-benzophenon-ecarbonyl GB (22) in good yield (Scheme 3). In 10-benzophenonecarbonyl GB (22), the photoactivatablebenzophenone moiety is linked to the ginkgolide skel-eton through an ester linkage. After it is incorporatedinto the receptor, the ester group can be aminolyzedwith a fluorescent amine such as 1-pyrenemethylamine,thus avoiding the use of radioactivity for photolabelingand sequencing.54GC derivatives 17, 19, and 21 can be reacted furtherto incorporate fluorescent groups; for example, ben-zophenone derivative 17 was reacted with 1 equiv of5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-sulfonyl (dansyl) chlo-ride to give 10-O-benzophenone-7-O-dansyl GC (23) withalmost exclusive reaction at 7-OH (Scheme 3). Interest-ingly, increasing the amount of dansyl chloride to 2equiv gave 10-O-benzophenone-1-O-dansyl GC (24) aswell as 23 in a 1:1 ratio.All compounds were characterized by NMR spectros-copy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).Purity of the derivatives 16-24, with aromatic groups,was determined by high-performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC)-UV and 1H NMR and was in the rangeof 98-100%. Because ginkgolides (1-5) and bilobalide(6) absorb only weakly in the UV spectrum, HPLC-UVcannot be used for determination of purity. Instead,observation of the 12-H 1H NMR signal of 1-6 is aparticularly useful way to determine purity, as thissignal has distinct and well-separated ä-values forginkgolides, bilobalide, and their derivatives.Pharmacology. The native TTLs (1-6), as well asginkgolide derivatives 16-24, were tested for theirability to bind to PAFR using a radioligand bindingassay with membrane fractions from hearts and skeletalmuscles of PAFR transgenic mice.53 Initially, compoundswere tested in concentrations of 5 íM against [3H]WEBScheme 2aa Reagents: (a) 4-(Bromomethyl)benzophenone, KH.

The degree of non-specific binding was determined to be ca. 50% for[3H]PAF and less than 5% for [3H]WEB 2086. Accord-ingly, the assays were performed using [3H]WEB 2086rather than [3H]PAF as the radioligand, due to the highdegree of nonspecific binding of the latter.All compounds were dissolved in DMSO to obtain 5mM stock solutions of test compounds. Examination ofthe effect of DMSO on the binding of [3H]WEB 2086revealed that up to 1% DMSO (final concentration) wasacceptable, but 1-2.5% resulted in a slight inhibitionof [3H]WEB 2086 binding. Generally, this caused noproblem; however, with very weakly binding com-pounds, the relatively high DMSO concentration insolutions above 100 íM had a small inhibitory effect,thus leading to a slight overestimation of their poten-cies. Previous studies have reported problems associatedwith the solubilization of ginkgolides specifically inDMSO,55 but similar problems were not observed in thepresent study.Native ginkgolides (1-5) and bilobalide (6) weretested with the cloned PAFR (Table 1). GB (2) was themost potent compound with a Ki value of 0.56 íM, whileGA (1) was slightly less potent with a Ki of 1.46 íM.GC (3) and ginkgolide J (GJ, 4) were significantly lesspotent, while ginkgolide M (GM, 5) and bilobalide (6)both had Ki values larger than 50 íM.The GB-derived photoactivatable compounds 16, 18,20, and 22 with Ki values in the range 0.09-0.15 íM(Table 2) were all more potent than GB (2), whilecompounds 17, 19, and 21 derived from GC (3) with Kivalues of 0.47-0.79 íM were equipotent to GB (2) (Table2), despite the fact that GC (3) itself is only weaklypotent. Besides proving that aromatic groups linked to10-OH enhance activity in both GB (2) and GC (3)derivatives, these results also indicate that the specifictype of photoactivatable group was less important.Derivatives 23 and 24 possessing a fluorescent dansylgroup at either 1- or 7-OH were both less potent than10-O-benzophenone GC (17) without the dansyl group,with Ki values of 3.94 and 0.96 íM for 23 and 24,respectively. However, an important difference wasobserved in the activities between the two; the 1- and10-disubstituted analogue (24) was ca. four times morepotent than the 7- and 10-disubstituted analogue (23).PAFR is linked to several intracellular signal trans-duction pathways including elevation of intracellularcalcium concentration,22 which can be used for analyzingfunctional responses of PAFR ligands.56 In the presentstudy, the compounds with Ki values below 5 íM, i.e.,GA (1), GB (2), and analogues 16-22, were investigatedfor their ability to mobilize intracellular calcium inChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing thePAFR.57 While none of them evoked calcium responses,they all suppressed PAF-induced intracellular calciumincrease (data not shown) confirming their function asPAFR antagonists. Because the assay is based on themeasurement of the fluorescence of a Ca2+ sensitive dye,the fluorescence of analogues 23 and 24 interfered withthe measurement and could not be assayed.DiscussionNine analogues (16-24) with photoactivatable groups,and in the case of 23 and 24 with fluorescent dansylgroups as well, have been prepared from native gink-golides GB (2) and GC (3) by selective derivatizationsof the hydroxyl groups. Generally, the increased reactiv-ity of the 1-OH and 10-OH as compared to 7-OH hasbeen rationalized by stabilization of the correspondingalkoxides by hydrogen bonding between 1-OH and 10-OH,58 but this does not explain the interesting selectiv-ity for the 10-OH position in reactions with benzylbromide derivatives. Notably, reaction of GC (3) with abulky silyl chloride protection group occurs exclusivelyat the 1-OH of GC.59 Three different photoactivatablemoieties, all of them benzyl derivatives, were incorpo-Table 1.

The benzophenone moietywas commercially available, whereas trifluoromethyl-diazirine 12 and tetrafluorophenyl azide 15 moietieswere synthesized in six and three steps, respectively(Scheme 1). The three different types of photoactivatablegroups were selected on the basis of their differentreactive intermediates when irradiated, the intermedi-ates being a radical, a carbene, and (singlet) nitrene forbenzophenone, trifluoromethyldiazirine, and tetrafluo-rophenyl azide, respectively.All native TTLs (1-6) as well as the derivatizedcompounds were investigated with respect to theirbinding to cloned PAFR isolated from transgenic mice(Figure 3 and 4). To the best of our knowledge, this isthe first report on the effect of TTLs on the clonedPAFR, since previous SAR studies of PAFR antagonismwith TTLs and derivatives was performed by monitoringinhibition of PAF-induced rabbit platelet aggregation.GB (2) has generally been reported to be a potentantagonist of the PAFR based on the latter assay withan IC50 value around 0.2 íM,40-42 which corresponds tothe Ki value of 0.56 íM obtained in this study (Table1). GA (1), with one hydroxyl group less than GB (2),was only slightly less potent than GB (2, Figure 3),indicating that the OH-1 is not essential for activity,and neither is the hydrogen bonding between OH-1 andOH-10. Generally, the binding of GC (3), GJ (4), andGM (5) with hydroxyl groups at C-7, as compared to thebinding activity of GA (1) and GB (2) lacking the 7-OH,was decreased showing that the 7-OH is not necessaryfor binding to PAFR whereas hydroxyl groups at otherpositions appear to be less important (Figure 3). Thestudy also confirmed that bilobalide (6), a TTL with onlyone five-membered carbocycle and three lactones, is notdisplacing [3H]WEB 2086 binding in concentrations upto 100 íM (Table 1).All seven photoactivatable analogues 16-22 witharomatic substituents at 10-OH improved the affinityto the PAFR relative to the activities of GB (2) and GC(3) (Figure 4). This is in agreement with previous SARstudies of GB (2),40-42 as well as a three-dimensional(3D)-quantitative SAR (QSAR) study on ginkgolides.60However, it is interesting to note that aromatic substi-tutions at 10-OH of GC (3) as in compounds 17, 19, and21 improve the affinity to PAFR ca. 20-fold thus makingthem equipotent to GB (2), while the same substitutionsin GB (2) increase the affinity only 6-fold (Figure 4).Furthermore, the similar affinities of GB derivatives 16,18, 20, and 22 and the similar affinities of GC deriva-tives 17, 19, and 21 (Figure 4) imply that it is the stericbulk or the lipophilicity, including ð-ð interactions ofthe substituents, rather than the specific functionalgroups that are important for the increase in affinity.GC derivatives 23 and 24 (Scheme 3) with dansylgroups at 7-OH and 1-OH are less potent and equipo-tent, respectively, to their parent compound, 10-O-benzophenone-GC (17). In compound 23, which is ca.six times less active than 17, the bulk at the 7-positionseems to be responsible for the reduction in affinity. Thefact that compound 24 is equipotent to 17 suggests thatonce a bulky aromatic group occupies this area, furtheraromatic groups neither increase nor decrease theaffinity.In conclusion, an investigation of the effect of TTLsisolated from G. biloba on the cloned PAFR has dem-onstrated that among the native compounds, GA (1) andGB (2) are the most potent. A series of photoactivatableanalogues have been prepared, and PAFR bindingassays showed that most of these analogues were morepotent antagonists than their parent compounds, thusproviding promising candidates for the planned studiesof the interaction of ginkgolides with the PAFR. Theginkgolide derivative containing both a photoactivatableand a fluorescent group, compound 24, retained affinityFigure 3.

General Procedures. Ginkgolides and bilo-balide (1-6) were obtained by extraction of leaves from G.biloba, purification by column chromatography, and recrys-tallization, as previously described,3,61 and purity was >99%as determined by 1H NMR. Solvents were dried by elutingthrough alumina columns. Triethylamine was freshly distilledfrom NaOH pellets. Unless otherwise noted, materials wereobtained from a commercial supplier and were used withoutfurther purification. All reactions were performed in predriedglassware under argon or nitrogen, and all reactions involvingazides or diazirines were performed in dim red light. Flashcolumn chromatography was performed using ICN silica gel(32-63 mesh) or ICN silica gel (32-63 mesh) impregnatedwith sodium acetate.61Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out usingprecoated silica gel 60 F254 plates with thickness of 0.25 ím.Spots were observed at 254 nm and by staining with aceticanhydride or cerium/molybdenum in H2SO4. 1H and 13C NMRspectra were obtained on Bruker DMX 300 or Bruker DMX400 MHz spectrometers and are reported in parts per million(ppm) relative to internal solvent signal, with coupling con-stants (J) in Hertz (Hz).

Heart and skeletal musclesfrom 13 to 27 months old PAFR transgenic (PAFR-Tg) mice,62which overexpress guinea pig PAFR, were homogenized in aPolytron homogenizer in cold buffer A [25 mM Hepes/NaOH(pH 7.4), 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, and aprotease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Boehringer Mannheim)].An 800g (for 10 min) supernatant of the homogenate wascentrifuged at 100 000g at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resulting pelletwas suspended in buffer A and stored at -80 °C until use.The protein concentration of the suspended membrane fractionwas 1.37 mg/mL, as measured by the method of Bradford63using the Bio-Rad protein assay solution and fatty acid-freebovine serum albumin (BSA; Bayer, Kankakee, IL) as astandard. The radioligand binding assays were performedessentially as previously described.53 The membrane fractionsfrom hearts and skeletal muscles of PAFR-Tg mice (50 íL ofsuspension containing 121 fmol of PAFR) were mixed with 2pmol of [3H]WEB 2086 (NEN Life Science Products, Boston,MA) in 50 íL of buffer B [25 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.25M sucrose,10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA], and the compound wasto be tested in 100 íL of buffer B in a 96 well microplate intriplicate for each concentration. These mixtures were incu-bated at 25 °C for 90 min, upon which the receptor-bound [3H]-WEB 2086 was filtered on a UniFilter-GF/C (Packard Bio-science, Meriden, CT) using a MicroMate 196 simultaneous96 well harvester (Packard Bioscience). The filter was thenwashed 10 times with cold buffer B and dried at 50 °C for atleast 90 min, 25 íL of MicroScint-0 scintillation cocktail(Packard Bioscience) was added, and filters were placed in aTopCount microplate scintillation counter (Packard Bio-science). Binding data were analyzed with the nonlinear curve-fitting program Microplate Manager III (Bio-Rad, Hercules,CA). Calculated IC50 values were then converted to Ki valuesusing the Cheng-Prusoff correction,64 with the followingequation: Ki ) IC50/(1 + [L]/KD), where [L] is the concentrationof the radioligand, and KD is the previously determineddissociation constant for [3H]WEB 2086 (4.3 nM).53 Nonspecificbinding was determined using methods as previously de-scribed.53Intracellular Calcium Mobilization. CHO cells express-ing human PAFR57 were subjected to the calcium assay asdescribed previously56 except that Fura-2/AM was loaded inthe presence of chromophore EL (0.01%, Sigma). Each com-pound (100 íM) was applied to the cell suspension, and then,PAF (10 nM) was added after 3 min.Acknowledgment. We are grateful to Dr. YasuhiroItagaki for performing HRMS.
