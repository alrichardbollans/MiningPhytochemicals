As one of the hits, an ethyl acetate extractfrom inflorescences of Verbesina lanata showed significantinhibitory activity in vitro against grapevine downy mildew(Plasmopara viticola), with a MIC100 value of 35 μg/mL. Anemulsifiable concentrate formulation with 50 mg/g of theextract was developed for in vivo evaluation. A suspension ofthe formulation containing 1 mg/mL of extract lowered leafsurface infection of grapevine seedling by 82% compared tothe nontreated control. With the aid of HPLC-based activity profiling, the antifungal activity was correlated with a series oflipophilic compounds. Preparative isolation by a combination of chromatographic techniques afforded 16 eudesmanesesquiterpenes including eight new congeners. Nine compounds were obtained in sufficient quantities to be tested in vitro andwere found to inhibit the zoospore activity of P. viticola with MIC100 values ranging from 4 to 50 μg/mL. The two majorcompounds, 6β-cinnamoyloxy-4β,9β,15-trihydroxyeudesmane (9) and 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,15-dihydroxyeudesm-4-en-3-one(13), showed MIC100 values of 5 and 31 μg/mL, respectively.Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M. A. Curtis) Berl. & de Toni,known as grapevine downy mildew, is an obligately biotrophicoomycete that infects all green parts of grapevine plants. Thesporangia are spread by windblown rain. Under weatherconditions favorable for the pathogen, up to 100% of theyield can be lost if plants are left untreated.1Copper salts are widely used to fight against a wide range ofplant pathogens.2 Their use in agriculture was established in the1880s when the French scientist Millardet demonstrated thatspraying vineyards with a mixture of copper sulfate, lime, andwater (Bordeaux mixture) drastically reduced infection ofgrapevine by downy mildew.3 The use of copper is stillpermitted in conventional and organic production systems,4 butits utilization is increasingly criticized due to an unfavorableecotoxicological profile.2,5,6 Copper accumulates in soils and ispotentially toxic to some nontarget organisms.7−10Natural products, especially plant extracts, could serve assustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives since theyare typically rapidly degraded under field conditions.11−15Promising plant extracts with reported activity against P. viticolainclude Yucca schidigera, Salvia of f icinalis, Inula viscosa,Glycyrrhiza glabra, Larix decidua, Juncus ef fusus, and Vitisvinifera.4,14,16−20In an ongoing search for safer replacements of copperfungicides, an in-house library comprising over 3000 extracts ofplant and fungal origin (10 mg/mL in DMSO) was screenedfor in vitro inhibitory activity against grapevine downymildew.20,21 As one of the hits, an ethyl acetate extract frominflorescences of Verbesina lanata B. L. Rob. & Greenm.(Asteraceae) showed pronounced activity (MIC100 of 35 μg/mL). The genus Verbesina, commonly known as “crownbeard”,comprises over 300 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees bearingnumerous bright yellow flowerheads.22−24 V. lanata isdistributed in Central America22 and has not been phytochemi-cally investigated up to now.We here report on the isolation and structure elucidation of16 eudesmane sesquiterpenes (1−16), including eight newcongeners, with strong inhibitory activity against P. viticola.■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompound Isolation and Structure Elucidation.

Nat. Prod. 2017, 80, 3296−330432978 were found to be known eudesmane sesquiterpenes withcinnamoyloxy groups attached at C-6. They were identified as6β-cinnamoyloxy-4β-hydroxyeudesmane (1),25 6β-cinnamoy-loxy-3β,4α-dihydroxyeudesmane (2),26 6β-cinnamoyloxy-3α-hydroperoxy-1β-hydroxyeudesm-4(15)-ene (3),27 6β-cinna-moyloxy-3α-hydroperoxy-1β-hydroxyeudesm-4-ene (4),27 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β-hydroxyeudesm-4-en-3-one (5),27 6β-cinna-moyloxy-1β,3β-dihydroxyeudesm-4-ene (6),26 6β-cinnamoy-loxy-1β-hydroxyeudesm-3-ene (7),27 and 7-epi-6α-cinnamoy-loxy-1β,4α-dihydroxyeudesmane (8).26 These compounds havebeen previously isolated from species of the genus Verbesinaand/or from Brintonia discoidea, but they are reported here forthe first time from V. lanata. Some minor inconsistencies weredetected in the previously reported NMR data, and someassignments were therefore revised. Full 1H and 13C NMRspectroscopic assignments of 1−8 are provided as SupportingInformation.Compound 9 was obtained as a pale yellow oil. Its molecularformula was established as C24H34O5 from the [M + Na]+sodium adduct ion at m/z 425.2297 (calcd for C24H34NaO5+,425.2299) in the HRESIMS and corroborated by the 13C NMRdata. The 13C NMR spectrum showed the presence of signalsfor three methyls, five methylenes (including one oxygenatedcarbon (δC 69.0)), 12 methines (including seven olefinic andaromatic carbons), one oxygenated tertiary carbon (δC 73.6),one carbonyl (δC 167.5), and two quaternary carbons (δC 39.4and 134.4). The 1H and 13C NMR data were fully assigned by2D NMR (1H−1H, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) experiments(Table 1). Comparison of the NMR data with those ofcompounds 1 and 2 indicated that 9 also possesses a trans-decalin eudesmane skeleton with an axial (β) cinnamoyloxysubstituent at C-6. A hydroxy group was located at C-9 (δH3.21, δC 80.3), as shown by a COSY correlation between H2-8(δH 1.89 and 1.61) and H-9. HMBC correlations of H-5 (δH1.31) and H2-15 (δH 3.78 and 3.60) to δC 73.6 allowed theassignment of the oxygenated tertiary carbon as C-4 (δC 73.6).By HMBC correlations of H2-15 (δH 3.78 and 3.60) to C-3 (δC35.8), C-4 (δC 73.6), and C-5 (δC 49.0), the position of theoxygenated methylene (δC 69.0) was assigned at C-15. Therelative configuration was established from 1H−1H couplingconstants and NOESY correlations (Figure 2). Thus, thehydroxy group at C-9 was determined as equatorial due to thediaxial coupling of H-9 (δH 3.21, dd, J = 11.6/3.5 Hz) with H-8ax (δH 1.89, qd, J = 11.6/3.5 Hz). A NOESY correlation of H-9and H-5 (δH 1.31) confirmed the alpha-orientation of H-9.Similarly, the orientation of C-15 (δH 3.78 and 3.60) wasassigned as alpha by the NOESY correlation of H2-15 and H-5(δH 1.31). Thus, the structure of 9 was established as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-4β,9β,15-trihydroxyeudesmane.Compound 10 was obtained as a pale yellow, amorphoussolid. It had a molecular formula of C24H32O4 as determinedfrom a [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 407.2192 in the HRESIMS (calcdfor C24H32NaO4+, 407.2193) and thus differed by 16 units fromthat of 3. The NMR data of 10 (Table 1) closely resembledthose of 3. The only remarkable difference was an upfield shiftof C-3 in 10 (δH 4.33, δC 74.4; vs δH 4.44, δC 87.0 in 3), whichsuggested the replacement of the peroxide at C-3 by a hydroxygroup. Key NMR correlations for 10 are available as SupportingInformation (Figure S24). Accordingly, the compound wasassigned as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,3α-dihydroxyeudesm-4(15)-ene.Compound 11, isolated as a yellow oil, had the samemolecular formula (C24H32O4) as 10, as determined by theHRESIMS [M + H]+ ion at m/z 385.2373 (calcd forC24H33O4+, 385.2373). The NMR data indicated that 11 is apositional isomer of the latter. Comparison of 1H, 13C, and 2DNMR data (Table 1) suggested that the hydroxy group in 11had to be located C-2. This assignment was corroborated bykey COSY correlations of H-2 (δH 3.61) with H-1 (δH 3.11)and H2-3 (δH 2.62 and 2.11). The α-equatorial orientation ofOH-2 was deduced from the diaxial coupling of H-2 with H-1and H-3 (JH1−H2 = 9.2 Hz, and JH2−H3 = 11.0 Hz, respectively)and confirmed by the NOESY correlation of H3-14 with H-2ax(Figure S32, Supporting Information). Therefore, the structureFigure 2. Key COSY (blue bonds), HMBC (red arrows), and NOESYcorrelations (blue arrows) of compound 9.Journal of Natural Products ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00868J. Nat. Prod. 2017, 80, 3296−33043298of 11 was established as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,2α-dihydroxyeu-desm-4(15)-ene.Compound 12 was isolated as a colorless oil. The HRESIMS[M + H]+ ion at m/z 369.2427 (calcd for C24H33O3+,369.2424) established a molecular formula of C24H32O3.Comprehensive analysis of its NMR data (Table 1) showedthat 12 possesses a similar structure to those of 4−6, with adouble bond between C-4 and C-5. The only difference was atC-3, which appeared as a methylene (δH 2.17 and 2.09, δC32.5), instead of an oxygen-bearing carbon. This was confirmedby a COSY correlation of H2-2 (δH 1.66, overl.) with H2-3 andby an HMBC correlation of H3-15 (δH 1.88) with C-3 (δC32.5) (Figure S39, Supporting Information). Thus, thestructure of compound 12 was elucidated as 6β-cinnamoy-loxy-1β-hydroxyeudesm-4-ene.Compound 13 was obtained as a white solid. It showed a [M+ Na]+ adduct ion at m/z 421.1984 (calcd for C24H30NaO5+,421.1986), corresponding to a molecular formula of C24H30O5.By comparison of 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR data (Table 2) withthose of the other isolated compounds, 13 proved to bestructurally similar to 5, with the only difference being that themethyl group at C-15 (5: δH 2.03, δC 11.0) was replaced by anoxygenated methylene (13: δH 4.63 and 4.56, δC 55.3). Thisassignment was corroborated by HMBC correlations of H2-15with C-3 (δC 198.5) and C-5 (δC 157.5) (Figure S46,Supporting Information). Hence, 13 was assigned as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,15-dihydroxyeudesm-4-en-3-one.Compound 14 was isolated as a yellow oil. Its molecularformula of C24H32O4 was deduced from the HRESIMS [M +H]+ ion at m/z 385.2361 (calcd for C24H33O4+, 385.2373) andfrom the 13C NMR data. Comprehensive analysis of its NMRdata (Table 2) indicated the same planar structure as forcompound 6. The relative configuration of both compoundswas found to differ only in the orientation of the hydroxy groupat C-3. For compound 6, a J coupling constant for H-3/H-2 of7.0 Hz corresponded to a dihedral angle of about 150° andsuggested a β-orientation of the hydroxy group attached at C-3.This was also supported by the NOESY correlation of H-3 (δH4.10, apparent q, J = 7.0 Hz) with H-2eq (δH 2.11, ddd, J =11.5/7.0/3.0 Hz) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Incompound 14, the J coupling constant for H-3/H-2 of 4.0 Hz,arising from a dihedral angle of ca. 50°, indicated an alphaorientation of OH-3. This assignment was in agreement withthe NOESY correlation of H-2ax (δH 1.89) and H-3 (δH 4.06, brd, J = 4.0 Hz) (Figure S54, Supporting Information). Thus, thestructure of 14 was established as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,3α-dihydroxyeudesm-4-ene. Jakupovic et al.28 previously reportedH-3 (δH 4.08) in cinnamoyloxy-1β,3β-dihydroxyeudesm-4-ene(6) as a broad doublet with a coupling constant of 4 Hz.According to the NMR data of both epimers reported here, itseems likely that Jakupovic et al.26 isolated in fact 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,3α-dihydroxyeudesm-4-ene and reported iterroneously as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,3β-dihydroxyeudesm-4-ene.Compound 15 was obtained as a yellow oil.

Nat. Prod. 2017, 80, 3296−33043299revealed a strong resemblance to 7. The only difference was atC-15, which was an oxygenated methylene (15: δH 4.21 and3.95, δC 65.0) instead of a methyl group (7: δH 1.70, δC 20.6).This was confirmed by HMBC correlations of H2a-15 (δH 3.95)with C-3 (δC 124.4) and C-5 (δC 48.3) (Figure S62, SupportingInformation). Thus, the structure of compound 15 wasdetermined as 6β-cinnamoyloxy-1β,15-dihydroxyeudesm-3-ene.Compound 16, a yellow solid, gave a molecular formula ofC24H34O5 as established by the [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 425.2295(calcd for C24H34NaO5+, 425.2299) in the HRESIMS. It wasthus an isomer of compound 9. The 13C NMR spectrumshowed the same multiplicities as for 9, suggesting the presenceof a trans-decalin eudesmane skeleton with a cinnamoyloxygroup. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 2) were fullyassigned by 2D NMR (1H−1H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC)experiments and revealed some differences between 9 and 16.First, key HMBC correlations of H2-15 (δH 4.30 and 4.13) tothe carbonyl C-1′ (δC 167.0) inferred the attachment of thecinnamoyloxy group at H2-15 (Figure 3). Consequently, H-6was shifted upfield (δH 4.44, br s, δC 69.2) compared to thecorresponding resonances in the cinnamoyl eudesmanederivatives 1−15. Further differences from compound 9 werethe presence of a hydroxy group at C-1 (δH 3.22, δC 79.7) andof a methylene at C-9 (δH 1.94 and 1.06, δC 39.3). The relativeconfiguration of 16 was established as follows. Characteristic13C NMR shifts of C-14, C-10, and C-528 and 1,3-diaxialNOESY correlations indicated a trans junction of the decalinring system (Figure 3). The β-equatorial orientation of thehydroxy group at C-1 was supported by the diaxial coupling H-1/H-2axial (J = 12.0 Hz). The multiplicities of H-6 (δH 4.44, brs) and H-7 (δH 0.88, m) were similar to those found incompounds 1−15 and indicated their beta cofacial orientation.Finally, the configuration at C-4 was deduced from the NOESYcontacts of H2-15 and H-5. Compound 16 was thus assigned as15-cinnamoyloxy-1β,4β,6β-trihydroxyeudesmane.The absolute configuration of compound 12 was assigned byelectronic circular dichroism (ECD). The experimental ECDspectrum of 12 showed a negative Cotton effect at 280 nm dueto the π→ π* transition of the cinnamoyl group (Figure 4) andcorresponding to a strong UV absorption maximum (FigureS40, Supporting Information). The experimental ECDspectrum of 12 matched well with the ECD curve calculatedfor the (1R,6R,7S,10R) enantiomer (Figure 4). The ECDspectra of compounds 4−6, 13, and 14 were similar to that of12. They all had the same allylic cinnamate group, and the ECDdata suggested the same absolute configuration as for 12(Figures S5, S6, S8, S47, and S55, Supporting Information).The absolute configuration of the remaining compounds wasassigned tentatively based on biogenetic considerations and onthe assumption that they possess the same absoluteconfiguration at C-10. This was also in agreement with thereported absolute configuration of 2, which had beenestablished by X-ray single-crystal analysis.29Antifungal Activity. The crude plant extract showed aminimal inhibitory concentration (MIC100) against P. viticola of35.4 μg/mL, as determined in two independent experiments(Table 3). Owing to this promising activity in vitro, the extractwas then tested on grapevine seedlings. In a first attempt,however, no activity was detected, and the lack of activity wasfound to be due to insufficient solubility (data not shown). Toovercome this issue, an emulsifiable concentrate formulationwith 50 mg/g of extract was developed (VL-EC). Atconcentrations of 1 and 0.125 mg/mL of extract, the efficacieswere 82% and 73%, respectively, as expressed as the lowering ofinfected leaf surface in the treated set of seedlings compared tothe nontreated control set (disease severity of 92 ± 5%)(Figure 5).Compounds 2−5, 7−10, 14, and 16 were available insufficient amounts to be tested against P. viticola in vitro (Table3). Compounds 2, 4, 5, 10, and 14 exhibited MIC100 values of<10 μg/mL and thus were significantly more active than theextract. These data confirmed that eudesmane sesquiterpenesare the antifungal constituents of V. lanata extract.The genus Verbesina comprises a large number of species, butonly few of these have been investigated phytochemically.Figure 3.

Nat. Prod. 2017, 80, 3296−33043300Isoprenoids, in particular eudesmane sesquiterpenes, arereportedly the characteristic constituents of this genus.23Antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activity has beendescribed for Verbesina encelioides, but the compoundsresponsible for the activity were not identified.30 On theother hand, several eudesmane sesquiterpenes that have beenisolated from other plants, mostly Asteraceae, have shownantifungal and antibacterial activity against human patho-gens.31−36 However, their efficacy against plant pathogens hasnot been previously reported. V. lanata ethyl acetate extract andfive of the isolated compounds showed high inhibitory activityagainst P. viticola. The efficacy was comparable to that of otherextracts, such as those from Juncus ef fusus (MIC100 24 μg/mL;active constituent dehydroeffusol, MIC100 4 μg/mL),20 Larixdecidua (MIC100 23 μg/mL; active constituents larixyl acetateand larixol, MIC100 6 and 14 μg/mL, respectively),37 and Inulaviscosa, Yucca schidigera, Melaleuca alternifolia, and Quillajasaponaria (all >80% efficacy in vivo at 1 mg/mL).4 In contrast,extracts from Achillea millefolium, Brassica napus, Glycyrrhizaglabra, Quercus sp., Salvia of f icinalis, Solidago virgaurea, andRheum rhabarbarum showed comparable activity to V. lanata at10- to 15-fold higher concentration only.4 In conclusion, V.lanata extracts and eudesmane sesquiterpenes could providepotential alternatives to copper fungicides, especially in organicfarming. However, further studies under field conditions arerequired to substantiate their potential. The toxicologicalprofiles of the plant extract and pure compounds also needto be investigated to assess the safety of such possible products.■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures.

Optical rotations were measured inMeOH on a P-2000 digital polarimeter (Jasco) equipped with asodium lamp (589 nm) and a 10 cm temperature-controlled microcell.UV and ECD spectra were recorded, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mLin MeOH, on a Chirascan CD spectrometer with 1 mm path precisioncells 110 QS (Hellma Analytics). NMR spectra were recorded on aBruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for1H and 125 MHz for 13C. The instrument was equipped with a 1 mmTXI microprobe operated at 18 °C or a 5 mm BBO probe at 23 °C(Bruker Biospin). Chemical shifts are reported as δ values (ppm), withresidual solvent signal as internal reference, J in Hz. Standard pulsesequences from the Topspin 2.1 software package were used.Plant Material. Inflorescences of Verbesina lanata were collected inNovember 2001 in Campana, Panama, by CIFLORPAN (Center forPharmacognostic Research on Panamanian Flora), Panamaniancollection number FLORPAN 5456. A voucher specimen is depositedat the Herbarium of the University of Panama. The taxonomic identitywas confirmed by Alex Espinosa, botanist at CIFLORPAN. Thematerial was air-dried and minced in Panama. A voucher specimen(no. 948) is also available at the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology,Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel.Extraction and Isolation. Powdered inflorescences (300 g) weremixed with sea sand and percolated sequentially at room temperaturewith petroleum ether (3.5 L), ethyl acetate (8.6 L), and methanol (6.5L) to afford, after evaporation under reduced pressure, 8.8 g ofpetroleum ether extract, 7.6 g of ethyl acetate extract, and 22.8 g ofmethanol extract. A portion of the ethyl acetate extract (6.8 g) wasdissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate andadsorbed onto ca. 20 g of silica gel. The dried powder was then loadedonto an open column filled with silica gel (65 cm × 5 cm i.d.). Elutionwas performed with a step gradient of n-hexane/ethyl acetate [95:5(2.5 L), 90:10 (2.0 L), 85:15 (1.0 L), 80:20 (3.0 L), 70:30 (2.0 L),60:40 (2.0 L), 50:50 (2.0 L), 30:70 (2.0 L), and 0:100 (2.5 L)],followed by ethyl acetate/methanol [95:5 (2.0 L), and 80:20 (2.0 L)],at a flow rate of approximately 25 mL/min. A total of 26 fractions (FrsA−Z) were collected based on TLC analysis.Fraction P (28 mg) was submitted to semipreparative RP-HPLCwith a gradient of 40% to 100% acetonitrile in 30 min at a flow rate of4 mL/min. Repeated injections afforded compound 1 (1.0 mg, tR 27.8min).

Efficacy of a formulated Verbesina lanata extract (VL-EC),blank formulation (Blank), and a copper control (Cu2+) againstPlasmopara viticola on grapevine seedlings under semicontrolledconditions. VL-EC contained 5% extract and 95% additives. VL-ECand the blank were tested at two concentrations (“Conc. 1”: 20 mg/mL VL-EC (1 mg/mL of extract) or 19 mg/mL of formulationadditives (blank); “Conc. 2”: 2.5 mg/mL VL-EC [0.125 mg/mL ofextract or 2.4 mg/mL of formulation additives (blank)]. The diseaseseverity in the control was 92 ± 5%. The figure shows means andstandard deviations of one experiment (n = 6).Journal of Natural Products ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00868J. Nat. Prod. 2017, 80, 3296−33043301gradient of 50% to 100% acetonitrile in 30 min at a flow rate of 25mL/min. Compounds 2 (41.7 mg, tR 28.6 min), 8 (10.1 mg, tR 23.9min), and 16 (11.2 mg, tR 21.6 min) were obtained from a portion(300 mg) of Fr W (304 mg). Separation was achieved by preparativeRP-HPLC (Puriflash system), using a gradient of 30% to 100%acetonitrile in 30 min; the flow rate was 20 mL/min. A portion (542mg) of Fr X (1325 mg) was separated by preparative RP-HPLC(Puriflash system) into 10 subfractions (Frs X1−X10) with 50%acetonitrile for 45 min and a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Subfractions X2,X5, and X7 afforded compounds 9 (6.6 mg, tR 16.0 min), 15 (8.0 mg,tR 24.0 min), and 14 (30.6 mg, tR 29.6 min), respectively. Furtherpurification of subfractions X4, X9, and X10 by semipreparative RP-HPLC afforded compounds 13 (2.2 mg, tR 37.0 min), 6 (1.1 mg, tR48.3 min), and 11 (9.5 mg, tR 25.5 min), respectively. Separations wereperformed with 65% B (X4) and 68% (X9) and 73% (X10) methanolat a flow rate of 4 mL/min. About half of Fr X6 (27 mg) was furtherpurified by semipreparative CN NP-HPLC with n-heptane/2-propanol(97:3) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min to afford 10 (9.0 mg, tR 16.0 min).The purity of compounds, as assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, was>95% for 2−6, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 16; >90% for 1, 7, 9, 12, and 14; and>80% for 15, which contained ca. 20% of another, unidentified,eudesmane derivative.Microfractionation of Fractions for Activity Profiling. Micro-fractionation of the active fractions (Frs P, Q, U, W, and X) wascarried out by analytical RP-HPLC on an LC-MS 8030 system(Shimadzu) connected with an FC 204 fraction collector (Gilson). Foreach fraction, a solution of 10 mg/mL was prepared in DMSO.Altogether four injections were performed: 3 × 30 μL with only UVdetection (254 nm) for collection (0.9 mg of fraction in total) and 1 ×10 μL with UV-ESIMS detection without collection. The mobile phaseconsisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with0.1% formic acid (B). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. Gradientsapplied were as follows: Frs P and Q, 40% to 100% B in 30 min; Fr. U,40% to 100% B in 40 min; Fr. W, 30% to 100% B in 30 min; Fr. X,30% to 70% B in 40 min. In each case, the column was washed with100% B for 5 min. Fractions of 1 min each were collected from minute2 to the end of the method (Frs P, Q, and W: 33 fractions; U and X:43 fractions). Microfractions from the three successive injections of agiven sample were collected into the corresponding wells of a 96-deep-well plate. Plates were then dried in a Genevac EZ-2 evaporator.HPLC-PDA-ESIMS Analysis. Analyses were performed on an LC-MS 8030 system (Shimadzu) using a SunFire C18 (3.5 μm, 150 × 3.0mm i.d.) column equipped with a guard column (10 mm × 3.0 mmi.d.) (Waters). The software for data acquisition and processing wasLabSolutions (Shimadzu). UV and mass detection ranges were 190 to600 nm and m/z 160−1500, respectively. The mobile phase consistedof water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formicacid (B). A gradient of 30% to 100% B in 30 min was applied, followedby 100% B for 5 min. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The sampleswere dissolved in DMSO (extract 10 mg/mL, fractions 5 mg/mL), and10 μL was injected.

Excitation energy (denotedby wavelength in nm), rotatory strength dipole velocity (Rvel), anddipole length (Rlen) were calculated in MeOH by TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-31G**, using the SCRF method, with the CPCM model. ECD curveswere obtained on the basis of rotatory strengths with a half-band of0.24 eV and UV shift using SpecDis v1.64.39 ECD spectra werecalculated from the spectra of individual conformers according to theircontribution calculated by Boltzmann weighting.In Vitro Antifungal Bioassays. Fractions A−Z (26 fractions)obtained from open column chromatography were dissolved at aconcentration of 5 mg/mL in DMSO. A 7.5 μL amount of the stocksolutions was added to 96-well plates containing 117.5 μL of mineralwater and were then serially diluted in the test plate 1:5 and 1:25 withmineral water. Next, 20 μL of a continuously stirred sporangiasuspension of Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Berl. & DeToni ((1.8−2.5) × 105 sporangia/mL) (prepared as described belowin the subsection “In Vivo Assays on Seedlings”) was added to eachwell. The resulting test concentrations were 250, 50, and 10 μg/mL,respectively.For the determination of MIC100, defined as the concentrationneeded to completely inhibit the activity of zoospores, the crudeextract and pure compounds 2, 4, 5, 7−10, 14, and 16 were dissolvedin DMSO at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Compounds 1, 3, 6, 11−13,and 15 were not tested due to the insufficient amounts available. Eachsolution was then serially diluted 1:1 in 50% DMSO to 3.9 μg/mL.Aliquots of 6 μL of each concentration were added to 94 μL of mineralwater before adding 20 μL of the sporangia solution ((1.8−2.5) × 105sporangia/mL). Resulting concentrations of the test products werebetween 0.195 and 100 μg/mL.In all in vitro experimental sets, the effect of the solvent (DMSO)alone was tested in at least two replicates in all relevant concentrations.The activity of zoospores was assessed 2−3 h after setup of theexperiment using a binocular at magnifications of 50- to 100-fold. Fordetermination of MIC100, a distinction was made between “nozoospores germinated, or all zoospores inactive” and “active zoosporespresent”. For assessment of activity of fractions and microfractions,inhibition levels were scored as follows: 0, similar to water control; 1,distinct reduction in number and/or activity of zoospores; 2, nozoospores germinated, or all zoospores inactive. To visualize overallinhibitory activity, inhibition levels of all three concentrations weresummed up, resulting in values between 0 (no inhibition at highesttested concentrations) and 6 (complete inhibition down to lowesttested concentration).To calculate mean MIC100, data were log2 transformed. Data werethen retransformed to linear scale.In Vivo Assays on Seedlings. Bioassays were carried out undersemicontrolled conditions in experimental facilities (greenhouse andgrowth chambers). Small grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. “Chasselas”seedlings were transplanted to individual pots (0.275 L) containing astandard substrate (“Einheitserde Typ 0”, Gebr. Patzer GmbH & Co.KG) previously amended with 3 g/L of a mineral fertilizer (Tardit 3M,Hauert Günther Düngerwerke GmbH). Plants were grown in thegreenhouse at a minimal temperature of 18 °C under natural light. Thephotoperiod was extended with sodium high-pressure lamps to 16 h.Plants were used for bioassays when they had three or four fullydeveloped leaves (2−3 weeks after transplanting).Each experimental set included a nontreated noninoculated control,a water-treated inoculated control, and a standard treatment (copperhydroxide, Kocide Opti, DuPont de Nemours) at two concentrations(300 and 30 μg/mL of copper). All experiments included six replicateplants per treatment. A formulation of V. lanata extract was used,containing 5% of the extract, 84% of a solvent (ethyl acetate), and 11%of an emulsifier (Emulsogen EL360, Clariant) in order to enhancesolubility in water. The formulation was added to demineralized waterat concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg plant extract/mL. As acontrol, a blank formulation was tested at corresponding concen-trations. Plants were sprayed with the test products using an air-assisted hand sprayer (DeVilbiss Compact MINI HVLP Touch-Upspray gun) until the leaves (adaxial and abaxial side) were completelycovered with a dense layer of small droplets. Plants were leftsubsequently to dry at room temperature before inoculation. P. viticolasporangia suspensions were prepared from previously infected plantsby washing freshly sporulating grapevine leaves with water and filteringthrough cheese cloth. The concentration of the sporangia suspensionswas adjusted to 5 × 104 sporangia/mL. Plants were spray-inoculatedusing the air-assisted hand sprayer on the abaxial leaf side. Inoculatedplants were subsequently incubated at 20−21 °C and 80−99% relativehumidity (RH) in the light for 24 h. Then, plants were maintained at20 °C, 60−80% RH, with a 16/8-h day/night light regime. Next, 5 to 6days after inoculation, plants were incubated overnight in the dark at20 °C and 80−99% RH to promote sporulation. Disease incidence(the percentage of leaves with disease symptoms) and disease severity(the percentage of leaf area covered by lesions) were assessed 6 to 7days after inoculation. All disease assessments were made usingcontinuous values of percentage based on the European andMediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) standardscale.40Efficacies were calculated according to Abbott41 as (1 − (A × B−1))× 100, with A = disease severity on an individual plant and B = meandisease severity of control plants.■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT*S Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on theACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnat-prod.7b00868.HPLC-activity profiling of active fractions (Frs P, Q, U,W, and X); 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data forcompounds 1−8; ECD spectra of compounds 1−16; 1Dselective NOESY of compound 6; key COSY, HMBC,and NOESY correlations of compounds 10−15; UVspectrum of compound 12 in MeOH; and 1D and 2DNMR spectra of compounds 9−16 (PDF)■ AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding Author*Tel: +41-61-2071534.
