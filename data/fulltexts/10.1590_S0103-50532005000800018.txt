A origem biossintética das unidades isoprênicas do 4-nerolidilcatecol (1), principal
metabólito secundário de Potomorphe umbellata, foi investigada através da incorporação de
glicose marcada com [14C] e [13C], e com precursores das vias mevalonoídica e triose/piruvato,
incluindo mevalonolactona-[2-14C] e 3-fosfato de gliceraldeído-[U-14C], respectivamente. O
padrão de incorporação de glicose-[1-13C] em 1 foi determinado por experimentos de RMN 13C
quantitativos. O padrão de marcação revelou que o precursor foi especificamente incorporado,
e que as unidades isoprênicas presentes no 4-nerolidilcatecol são derivadas tanto do ácido
mevalônico, quanto da via triose/piruvato. Os resultados também indicaram que tanto a via
plastídica quanto citoplasmática são capazes de gerar unidades de difosfato de isopentenila
para a biossíntese de 1.
The biosynthetic origins of the isoprene units of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1), the major constituent
of Potomorphe umbellata, have been studied through feeding experiments with [14C]- and [13C]-
glucose, and with precursors of the mevalonic acid and triose/pyruvate pathways, namely,
[2-14C]-mevalonolactone and [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, respectively. The pattern of
incorporation of label from [1-13C]-glucose into 1 was determined by quantitative 13C NMR
spectroscopy. The labelling pattern revealed that the additive was specifically incorporated,
and that the isoprene units of the sesquiterpenoid moiety of 4-nerolidylcatechol were derived
from both the mevalonic acid and the triose/pyruvate pathways. The results indicate that both
plastidic and cytoplasmic pathways are able to provide isopentenyl diphosphate units for the
biosynthesis of 1.

Introduction
The terpenoids represent one of the largest classes of
secondary metabolites comprising, together with the
steroids, more than 30,000 compounds to date.1 Whilst
the terpenoids are known to play important roles in the
development and survival of every living organism,2 many
compounds of the class have been found to accumulate at
high levels in a number of plant species. They possess, as
a common building block, the isoprene unit that is formally
derived from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Originally,
the well-studied mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway was
considered to be the unique biosynthetic route to IPP and
was believed to operate in all organisms. However, an
alternative pathway has been shown to be involved in the
formation of the hopane triterpenes in bacteria3 and, more
recently, the widespread occurrence of this route within
the plant kingdom has been demonstrated.4-8 The reaction
sequence of the alternative pathway involves condensation
of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate leading to
the formation of 1-desoxyxylulose-5-phosphate, the first
C5 intermediate. Several subsequent steps, including an
intramolecular rearrangement, lead to IPP.4
There is some reason to believe that the triose/pyruvate
pathway is compartmentalised in the plastids of plant cells
and is involved in the formation of mono-, di-, and tetra-
terpenoids, whilst the MVA pathway is located in the
cytoplasm and is responsible for the synthesis of
sesquiterpenes and sterols.9 However, substantial evidence
indicates that this hypothesis of subcellular
compartmentation of plant terpenoid biosynthesis may be
simplistic as it does not take into account the exchange of
plastidic and cytoplasmic metabolites. For example, early
1407Biosynthetic Origins of the Isoprene Units of 4-NerolidylcatecholVol. 16, No. 6B, 2005
studies involving chamomile flowers (Chamomilla
recutita) demonstrated an efficient incorporation of label
from [1-13C]-glucose into sesquiterpenes, but revealed an
heterogeneous labelling pattern in the accumulated
farnesyl pyrophosphate. Thus, whilst the two initial
isoprene units clearly originated from the triose/pyruvate
route, the third unit was derived from both the MVA and
the triose/pyruvate pathways.10
The major constituent of leaves and roots of
Potomorphe umbellata is the powerful antioxidant,
4-nerolidylcatechol (1).11,12 Currently, no information is
available concerning the biosynthesis of either the
sesquiterpene or the catechol portion of this type of
compound. The aim of the present study was, therefore,
to determine the route of formation of the C15 moiety of 1
in leaves of P. umbellate through feeding experiments
involving appropriately labelled precursors. Determination
of the 13C-enrichment pattern in 1 following the
incorporation of label from [1-13C]-glucose revealed that
the sesquiterpene portion was derived from both the MVA
and the triose/pyruvate pathways.
Results and Discussion
Labelled, putative precursors of the sesquiterpene
portion of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1), namely, [3-14C]-R,S-
mevalonolactone and [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
were administrated to the leaves of Potomorphe umbellata,
together with [U-14C]-glucose, which is a precursor of both
mevalonolactone and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Freshly
harvested leaves were incubated, separately, with 2 μCi of
each of these precursors for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h, after which
time the leaf material was extracted with ethanol and
analysed by HPLC. Radiolabel from all precursors was
incorporated into 1 (Table 1). Specific and/or non-specific
incorporations of ≥ 1% were obtained within 72 h of feeding
with [3-14C]-R,S-mevalonolactone and [U-14C]-
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate but, as would be expected, a
considerably lower percentage incorporation (0.1 - 0.3%)
was attained with [U-14C]- glucose.
In order to determine the specificity of incorporation,
and hence the possible biosynthetic origin of the isoprenoid
moieties, experiments involving the incorporation of
[1-13C]-glucose into 4-nerolidylcatechol (1) were carried
out. Different patterns of 13C-enrichment in 1 would be
expected depending on the pathway followed.10,13,14 Thus,
the conversion of [1-13C]-glucose into IPP via the MVA
pathway would lead to the incorporation of label at positions
2, 4 and 5 of each isoprene unit. On the other hand, if [1-
13C]-glucose is converted into pyruvate, the resulting C5
units derived from the triose/pyruvate pathway should be
labelled at positions 1 and 5 (Figure 1). Whichever of the
two pathways is extant, no label should appear at position
3 of any of the isoprene units if [1-13C]-glucose is
specifically incorporated into 1.
In feeding experiments involving [1-13C]-glucose as a
putative precursor, eight young leaves of P. umbellata were
fed for 72 h with 100 μL of a 10% solution of [1-13C]-
glucose, and then extracted with ethanol. The ethyl acetate
soluble portion of the ethanol extract was fractioned by
column chromatography over silica gel followed by TLC
to afford 4-nerolidylcatechol (1). The 13C NMR spectra
of this sample of 1 and of 4-nerolidylcatechol at natural
abundance sample were measured in CDCl3 under
identical conditions. The relative abundances of 13C at
individual carbon atoms were calculated by comparison
of the integration values for the peaks in the labelled
sample with those in the natural abundance sample. The
values were normalised to a reference value of 1.1% for
13C abundance at the carbon with the lowest 13C-
enrichment (Table 2). Enhancement of the signals was

significant and varied in the range 2.9 - 6.9%. Most
importantly, no enrichment of the signals at C-3’, C-7’ or
C-11’ of 1 was observed indicating that label was not
incorporated into position 3 of any of the isoprene units
(Figure 1). This demonstrates that the label from [1-13C]-
glucose was incorporated specifically into 1, and not via
catabolic processes followed by re-incorporation, within
the time period of incubation. Furthermore, a significant
enrichment of the remaining carbons (C-2, 4-6) was found
(relative 13C abundance of 1.5%). This general labelling
might be due to complex metabolic turnover of [1-13C]-
glucose with following statistical distribution of the carbon
atoms in various positions of intermediates of carbohydrate
metabolism.
As shown in Table 2, feeding experiment with [1-13C]-
glucose resulted in clear enhancements of the signals at
positions 1, 2, 4 and 5 of all of the isoprene units of the
nerolidol moiety. Such a pattern of specific incorporation
is consistent with the simultaneous operation of the MVA
and triose/pyruvate pathways in the biosynthesis of the
sesquiterpenoid portion of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1) in P.
umbellata, and suggests an exchange of plastidic and
cytoplasmic IPP units. These results corroborate previous
studies9 that provided evidence of significant differences
in the degree of IPP exchange depending on the type and
developmental stage of the tissue, thus giving rise to flexible
compartmentalisation of terpenoid biosynthesis in plants.
Experimental
General
[3-14C]-R,S-Mevalonolactone (100.5 μCi mL-1) was
purchased from Dupont, [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde (50.0
μCi mL-1) and [U-14C]-D-glucose (1000 μCi mL-1) were
obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and
[1-13C]-D-glucose (99%) was from Aldrich. All solvents
were of reagent grade and redistilled prior to use. HPLC
separations were performed on a Waters 991 system
equipped with a photodiode array detector and a
Supelco LC-18 reverse phase column (250 x 4.6 mm
i.d.; 5 μm). The measurement of radioactivity was
carried out using a Tri-Carb® model 2100TR liquid
scintillation analyser. The 13C NMR spectra of samples
at natural abundance and 13C-labelled samples were
measured under identical conditions (125 MHz, 26 oC,
repetition time 0.955 s, 45o pulse angle) using a Varian
Unity 500 spectrometer.
Plant material
Leaves of Potomorphe umbellata employed in the
feeding experiments with 14C-labelled precursors were
collected from plants grown under a 16 h day regime in
greenhouses at the Institute of Biological Chemistry
(WSU) in Pullman, USA. Plants used in experiments
involving [1-13C]-glucose were grown under a natural day-
night regime in greenhouse at the Institute of Chemistry
(UNESP) in Araraquara, Brazil.
Administration of [14C]-labelled compounds to leaves of
P. umbellata
Young leaves of P. umbellata were excised and fed
for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h with 100 μL of a solution
containing 2 μCi of either [3-14C]-R,S-mevalonolactone,
[U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or [U-14C]-D-
glucose using one leaf for each feeding experiment. The
leaf was frozen in liquid nitrogen, dried overnight under
vacuum and extracted, with sonication, for 15 min with
ethanol (2 x 10 mL). The solvent was evaporated, the
residue was resuspended in methanol (1 mg mL-1) and a
10 μL aliquot analysed by HPLC (elution programme –
linear gradient of methanol : water from 65:35 to 85:15
in 10 min, followed by isocratic elution with 85:15 for a
further 10 min; flow rate - 1 mL min-1; detection - 280
nm). Fractions (1 mL) of the eluate were collected over
a 44 min period and submitted to liquid scintillation
counting.

Administration of [1-13C]-D-glucose to leaves of P.
umbellata
Eight young leaves (13.70 g) of P. umbellata were
excised and fed for 72 h with 100 μL of a 10% solution of
[1-13C]-D-glucose. The leaves were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and extracted, with sonication, for 15 min with
ethanol (2 x 25 mL). The solvent was evaporated and the
extract (0.52 g) fractioned by partition between ethyl
acetate and water. The ethyl acetate fraction (0.20 g) was
applied to a column chromatography of silica gel (20.00 g;
230 - 400 mesh; Merck) and eluted with hexane containing
increasing amounts of ethyl acetate (up to 50%) to yield
six fractions. The third and fourth fractions were
combined, and the resultant residue (0.09 g) chroma-
tographed on silica gel GF254 (Merck) TLC layers eluted
with hexane:ethyl acetate (7:3) to yield 4-nerolidyl-
catechol (1) (0.03 g).
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1 obtained from an
incorporation experiment with [1-13C]-glucose and
reference sample of 1 from field-grown plants were
recorded in CDCl3 under identical conditions with a
VARIAN 500 spectrometer (relative to CDCl3 at δH 7.24
ppm and δC 77.0 ppm). Evaluation of relative 13C-
enrichment was made by calculation from the relative
intensities of both spectra as reported for 4-nerolidyl-
catechol (1).3
