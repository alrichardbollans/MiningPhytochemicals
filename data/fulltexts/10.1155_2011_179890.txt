Seeking to develop a new analgesic phytomedicine, a spray-dried extract (SDE) of Aleurites moluccana (L.) Willd. leaves was
developed in scale up (5kg). The SDE was standardized at 3%w/w in relation to the ﬂavonoid 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin.
The SDE batches were evaluated in relation to their physical, physiochemical, and pharmacological characteristics. The results
demonstrated the reproducibility of the scale up SDE process which, when dosed orally, reduced carrageenan-induced mechanical
hypernociception, with an ID50% of 443mg/kg. Similar results were obtained with animals injected with complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA), in which SDE caused inhibition of 48 ± 4%. SDE was eﬀective in preventing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced
mechanical hypernociception (inhibition of 26 ± 10% and 33 ± 3%, at 250 and 500mg/kg, respectively). Swertisin and 2  -
O-rhamnosylswertisin isolated from the own extract were eﬀective in inhibiting the hypernociceptive response induced by
carrageenan (70 ± 2% and 50 ± 5%, resp.). Furthermore, 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin was capable of signiﬁcantly inhibiting the
mechanical sensitization induced by CFA or PGE2, with inhibitions of 25 ± 3% and 94 ± 6%, respectively. These results suggest
that the eﬀects of SDE are related, at least in part, to the presence of these ﬂavonoids.
1.Introduction
Aleurites moluccana (L.) Willd., Euphorbiaceae, popularly
known as “Candlenut tree” or “Indian Walnut”, among other
names, is a native plant to Malaysia, Polynesia, and the
South Sea Islands, with wide distribution throughout the
tropics. It is a medium-sized tree, up to 10m tall, which
grows abundantly throughout the south and southeast of
Brazil (S˜ ao Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul). It is used in folk
medicine for the treatment of fever, inﬂammation, asthma,
hepatitis, headache, gastric ulcer, and so forth. Its seeds are
used as an antirheumatic and as a fertilizer [1, 2]. Previous
studieshavedemonstratedthatthedichloromethanefraction
obtained from the leaves and bark of A. moluccana presents
antiviral activity [3], as well as antibacterial eﬀects against
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4]. The
methanol extract from the leaves of this plant exhibited
hypolipidemic eﬀects [5].
A. moluccana was introduced to Brazil in the 1980s as an
ornamental tree and is an important source of the oil used
in tannery [6] .T h e r ei sal a r g ea r e ai nS a n t aC a t a r i n aS t a t e
(Brazil)withmorethan6,000treesthatcanfurnishsuﬃcient
raw material for the pharmaceutical industry, and the
culture of domesticated species has already begun. Studies
conducted by our research group have demonstrated the
performance of the tree after some types of cutting and have
found that it develops well, requiring three to four months
to germinate. The purpose of these studies is to assure the
vegetable raw material source without interfering in the
growthofthetree,therebyensuring sustainablemanagement
of the biodiversity that culminates in the development of
a herbal medicine [7]. These results are in agreement with2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
previous studies, which observe that it can withstand both
high and low pH values, poor soils, slopes, and annual
rainfall of 6.4 to 42.9dm [6].
Previous experimental studiesconductedby our research
grouphavealsodemonstratedthatthehydroalcoholicextract
ofA.moluccana leaves and its hexane fraction exhibitantino-
ciceptive eﬀects, inhibiting acetic-acid-induced abdominal
writhing in mice [8]. This activity may be related to the
presence of2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin, a ﬂavone C-glycoside,
which caused92±4%inhibitionwhen evaluatedin thesame
model [9]. However, a more friendly technological extract
needs to be developed, with a view to enabling industrial
production of a herbal medicinal product, which must be
obtained on a large scale and standardized in relation to a
chemical marker, with stability, safety, and proven eﬃcacy
in preclinical and clinical studies, for further licensing by
the regulatory agencies for marketing and purposes, under
patent [7].
The aim of this work, therefore, is to obtain a repro-
ducible spray-dried extract (SDE) in the scaleup, standard-
ized in relation to a chemical marker, the ﬂavonoid 2  -
O-rhamnosylswertisin (MW=592g), the major compound
evidenced in the selected extract of A. moluccana leaves,
and to evaluate the antinociceptive eﬀect of the techno-
logical product, SDE, and two puriﬁed substances, 2  -O-
rhamnosylswertisin and swertisin, on diﬀerent experimental
models of pain in mice.
2.Materialsand Methods
2.1. Collection of Plant Materials. Leaves of A. moluccana
Willd. were collected in July 2007 in Tijucas, in the State of
Santa Catarina, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Professor Dr.
Ademir Reis (Department of Botany/UFSC, Florian´ opolis,
SC,Brazil).AvoucherspecimenwasdepositedattheBarbosa
Rodrigues Herbarium (Itaja´ ı, SC, Brazil) under number VC
Filho 001.
2.2.Preparation of Standardized Dried Extract. Three batches
of dried extracts were prepared at Centroﬂora (Botucatu,
SP, Brazil) on a pilot scale (5kg) using extractive conditions
optimized in previous works carried out by our group.
70kg of dried herbal drug was macerated in a reactor
for 5 days without stirring, with 700L of 70:30 (v/v)
ethanol:water solution at room temperature. The solution
was then percolated, passed through a ﬁlter wheel (40mm)
then passed through Nutshell ﬁlter with ﬁlter paper. The
solution was concentrated in Bernauer concentrator at
70◦C under vacuum (400mmHg), to obtain total solids of
approximately 40%. The concentrate was mixed with about
25% (w/w total solids of concentrate) of colloidal silicon
dioxide and dried in an industrial spray dryer (GEA Niro,
Søborg, Denmark) with an inlet temperature of 165–180◦C
and an outlet temperature of 70–80◦C.
The dried extracts were analyzed: morphological aspect
by scaning electron microscopy (SEM)with magniﬁcation of
60x, color, taste/odor, moisture, pH (10% solution in water),
aqueoussolubility (concentration of 10%), and bulk density,
according to the methodology described in the United States
Pharmacopeia [10].

2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin, using the methodology described
below.
2.2.1. Isolation, Identiﬁcation and Purity Determination of
Swertisin and 2-O-Rhamnosylswertisin. Milled air-dried
leaves of A. moluccana (600g) were extracted with methanol
at room temperature for 7 days. The solution was then
evaporated in a vacuum to obtain methanol crude extract
(yield of 8.5%). Puriﬁcation procedures (chromatographic
column—CC) were conducted with crude methanol extract
using silica gel 60 (70–230mesh) and elution with increasing
concentrations of methanol in dichloromethane to give
nine fractions (I–IX). Fractions I and II were grouped
and submitted to silica gel CC eluted with a mixture of
dichloromethane and methanol in step-gradient mode,
to yield swertisin (1) (Figure 1)i nt h ef o r mo fay e l l o w ,
amorphous powder (20mg), mp 242.6 to 243.4◦C. The
chemical structure was conﬁrmed by NMR-1Ha n d13C, as
previously reported [11, 12]. Similarly, fractions III and IV
were grouped and submitted to silica gel CC eluted with a
mixture of dichloromethane and methanol as eluent, with
increasing polarity, followed by ﬂash chromatography eluted
with a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (8:3) to
yield 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin (2) (Figure 1)i nt h ef o r m
of a yellow powder (490mg). The chemical structure was
conﬁrmed by NMR-1Ha n d13C as previously reported
[11, 13].
Swertisin (1) is an amorphous powder, mp 242.6–
243.4◦C. The isolated compound was conﬁrmed by NMR
spectroscopy using a Bruker AC-300 instrument, operating

infusion of the compound added to a solvent ﬂow of
0.6mL/min, split 1:3, acetonitrile:50mM ammonium
acetate (90:10, v/v). This was brought into the MS via
an ESI source and measured in the negative ion mode.
Nebulization was achieved using nitrogen gas at a pressure
of 50L/h. The capillary temperature was set at 350◦C. The
ESI-MS spectrum recorded in the negative ion mode showed
a [M-H]+peak at m/z 591, which was in agreement with
the expected molecular weight of 592 (C28H32O14)f o r2   -
O-rhamnosylswertisin. MS/MS analysis showed a loss of 146
mass units (peak at m/z 445), corresponding to the loss of
rhamnosyl moiety. Peaks were also observed at m/z 427 and
m/z 324. It should be pointed out that this is the ﬁrst report
on the MS analysis of this compound.
2.2.2. Quantitative Analysis of 2  -O-Rhamnosylswertisin Fla-
vonoid in Dried Extract. The HPLC system consisted of a
Waters 600 pump (Milford, Mass, USA); 2996 PDA detector,
automatic 717 plus injector, in line degasser AF, and
Millennium Empower software. The injections (20μL) were
carried out on a C8 X-Bridge 150 × 4,6mm (5um) (Waters,
Taunton, Mass, USA). The mobile phase consisted of a
gradient A (acetonitrile) and B (acidiﬁed water pH 3.54 with
acetic acid) of 10:90 (A:B) (0min), 25:75 (20min), and
10:90 (30min), maintaining this composition until 40min,
and a ﬂow rate of 0.5mL·min−1. The analysis was monitored
at 338nm and the column oven ﬁt to 30◦C.
All solvents were HPLC grade (Tedia, Fairﬁeld, Ohio,
USA) and were degassed by ultrasonic bath (Unique, Santo
Amaro, S˜ ao Paulo, Brazil). The water was puriﬁed using a
Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, Mass, USA). All solu-
tions were ﬁltered through 0.45μm membranes (Millipore,
Billerica, Mass, USA).
2.2.3. Pharmacological Studies
Animals. Female Swiss mice (25–30g), obtained from the
University of Vale do Itaja´ ı (UNIVALI, Itaja´ ı, Brazil), were
used throughout this study. Female mice were chosen to
investigate mechanical hypernociception based on the liter-
ature data, which indicates that females are more susceptible
todevelopingchronicnociception[14,15].Theanimalswere
housed under conditions of optimum light, temperature,
and humidity (12h light-dark cycle, 22±1◦C, 60 to 80%
humidity), with food and water provided ad libitum.A l l
proceduresused in thepresentstudyfollowed the“Principles
of Laboratory Animal Care” from NIH publication no. 85-

used were the minimum necessary todemonstrate consistent
eﬀects. The number of animals per group was 5–8.
Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hypernociception. To in-
duce inﬂammatory pain, the mice received an i.d. injection
of 50μL of carrageenan (300μg/paw) under the surface of
the right hindpaw [14]. To assess the systemic eﬀect of the
drug treatment, the mice received A. moluccana SDE (batch
1, 2, or 3; 125–500mg/kg, p.o.), 2  -O-rhamnosylswer-
tisin (30mg/kg; 50.6μmol/kg, p.o.), swertisin (30mg/kg,
67.2μmol/kg, p.o.), indomethacin (0.1–5mg/kg, p.o.), or
vehicle (10mL/kg, 0.9% NaCl solution), 1h before car-
rageenan injection. The mechanical hypernociception of all
the groups was assessed by means of von Frey ﬁlaments
(VFH), for up to 48h after carrageenan administration, as
described below.
CFA-Induced Mechanical Hypernociception. In an attempt
to evaluate the preventive eﬀect, the mice were pretreated
orally with A. moluccana SDE (batch 1; 125–500mg/kg),
2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin (10mg/kg; 16.86μmol/kg, p.o.),
indomethacin (10mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (10mL/kg, 0.9%
NaCl solution). 1h afterwards, they received an i.d. injec-
tion of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) (1mg/mL heat-
killed and dried Mycobacterium tuberculosis;e a c hm Lo f
vehicle contained 0.85mL paraﬃn oil plus 0.15mL mannide
monooleate; 20μL/paw) in the right hindpaw [16]. Mechan-
ical hypernociception was evaluated for up to 48h after CFA
injection.
Mechanical Hypernociception Induced by PGE2. To evalu-
ate the mechanical hypernociception, mice were treated
with A. moluccana SDE (batch 1; 125–250mg/kg, i.p.),
2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin (10mg/kg; 16.86μmol/kg, p.o.),
morphine (5mg/kg, s.c), or vehicle (10mL/kg, 0.9% NaCl
solution),30min beforethei.d.injection ofprostaglandin E2
(PGE2) (0.1nmol/paw) [16]. The mechanical hypernocicep-
tionwasmeasured with VFH,asdescribed below,at diﬀerent
time points after the i.d. injection of PGE2.
Von Frey Hair-Induced Hindpaw Withdrawal Response. To
evaluate mechanical hypernociception, the mice were indi-
vidually placed in clear Plexiglas boxes (9 × 7 × 11cm) on
elevated wire mesh platforms, to allow access to the ventral
surface of the right hindpaw. The withdrawal response
frequency was measured following 10 applications (duration
of 1s each) of von Frey hairs (VFH, Stoelting, Chicago, Il,
USA). The stimuli were delivered from below to the plantar
surface of the right hindpaw. The animals were acclimatized
for 30min before behavioural testing, and mechanical
hypernociception was evaluated at several time points. A
VFH of 0.6g produces a mean withdrawal frequency of
about 15%, which is considered to be an adequate value for
the measurement of mechanical hypernociception [14, 17].
Therefore, 0.6g VFH was used throughout this study. To
determine the basal mechanical thresholds, all the groups
were evaluated before the test.
Drugs and Reagents. The following drugs and reagents were
used: CFA (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo
USA); carrageenan, PGE2 (Fluka Riedel-de Ha¨ en, Seelze,
Germany); indomethacin (DEG Importac ¸˜ ao de Produtos
Qu´ ımicos Ltda). All the other reagents and solvents used
were of analytical grade.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5

mean±S.E.M. of 5 to 7 animals, except for the ID50 values
(i.e., the dose of A. moluccana DE that reduced the
hypernociceptive responses by 50% relative to the control
values), which are presented as means accompanied by
their respective 95% conﬁdence limits. The ID50 values
and the percentages of inhibition were based on AUC
(area under curve), calculated using the entire time course
of each experiment and reported as mean±S.E.M. of
inhibitions obtained for each individual experiment.
Statisticalcomparison ofthe datawas performed by two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s post
hoc test and by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test.
P-values lower than 0.05 (P<0.05 or less) were considered
signiﬁcant.
3.Results
3.1. Isolation, Identiﬁcation, and Purity Determination of
Flavonoids. The phytochemical procedures conducted with
the crude methanol extract obtained from A. moluccana
leaves using silica gel CC and ﬂash chromatography led
to the isolation and identiﬁcation of two main ﬂavone C-
glycosides, swertisin (1)a n d2   -O-rhamnosylswertisin (2)
(Figure 1). Although the spectral data has been previously
published [13], this is the ﬁrst report on the MS analysis of
this compound.
Purity analysis was performed by means of HPLC, and
at 338nm, 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin was identiﬁed with
a 24.5min retention time and swertisin with a 25.5min
retention time Figure 2(a). After integration of all the peaks
at 338nm, a purity >95% of ﬂavonoids was calculated,
Figure 2(a).
3.2.Preparation ofStandardized Dried Extract. TheA.moluc-
cana dried extract batches obtained in pilot scale by spray
drier showed similar physical and chemical characteristics,
Table 1. The dried extracts are characterized as ﬁne and
hygroscopic powder, spherical particles with a smooth
surface, greenish brown in color, with approximately 3%
moisture (Figure 3). The 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin content
of the extracts was similar, and the physical and chemical
results were in agreement with the data obtained in previous
studies to optimize the extraction process and biological
activity in vivo.
The chromatographic proﬁle of dried extract by HPLC
showed the presence of various ﬂavonoid compounds
including 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin (the major component,
peak 8) and swertisin (peak 9), Figure 2(a).
3.3. Pharmacological Studies. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) demon-
strate that i.d. injection of carrageenan (300μg/paw) signif-
icantly reduced the mechanical sensitivity threshold (P<
0.05), when compared to the response rate of the con-
trol group with animals injected with saline solution and
basal thresholds. The oral treatment with A. moluccana
(500mg/kg) was able to reduce the mechanical hyper-
nociception induced by i.d. injection of carrageenan, with
inhibition of 36±4% and ID50% of 443 (400–490)mg/kg.
Indomethacin, a non steroidal antiinﬂammatory drug used
as a positive control, was also capable of inhibiting the
mechanical sensitization induced by carrageenan, with inhi-
bition of 38±5%.
Signiﬁcant results were obtained with animals injected
with CFA, where A. moluccana SDE (batch 1; 500mg/kg,
p.o.) reduced the hypernociceptive threshold for up to 6h
after CFApaw injection, with inhibition of 48±4% at a dose
of500mg/kg,see Figures4(c)and 4(d).The nonsteroid anti-
inﬂammatory drug indomethacin (10mg/kg, p.o.), dosed
orally, did not interfere with the hypernociceptive threshold
induced by CFA in mice.
As illustrated in Figures 4(e) and 4(f), i.d. injection of
PGE2 (0.1nmol/paw) into the mouse hindpaw produced
prominent mechanical hypernociceptive eﬀects lasting for
up to 24h, as indicated by a marked increase in baseline
values in response to 0.6g VFH stimulation. A. moluccana
DE (batch 1; 125 to 500mg/kg, p.o., 1h) proved to be eﬀec-
tive in signiﬁcantly preventing PGE2-induced mechanical
hypernociception up to 1h after the irritant agent injection,
Figures 4(e) and 4(f). The percentages of reduction were
26±10% and 33±3%, for 250 and 500mg/kg, respectively.
Morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.), the drug used as positive control,
reduced the hypernociceptive response induced by PGE2,
with inhibition of 48±6%, Figure 4(f).
The antinociceptive eﬀect of the isolated markers,
swertisin and 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin (30mg/kg, p.o., 1h
before), was also investigated in the carrageenan-induced
mechanical hypernociception model in mice. Figures 5(a)
and 5(b) demonstrate that both swertisin and 2  -O-
rhamnosylswertisin were eﬀective in inhibiting the hyper-
nociceptive response, when compared with the control
group, with inhibitions of 70±2% and 50±5%, respec-
tively. Furthermore, 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin was capa-
ble of signiﬁcantly inhibiting the mechanical sensitization
induced by CFA or PGE2, with inhibitions of 25±3%
and 94±6%, respectively, see Figures 5(c) and 5(d).2   -
O-rhamnosylswertisin accounts for 3% of the dried extract
obtained from A. moluccana,a se v i d e n c e db yH P L C ,s e e
Figure 2.
Finally, when the dried extract produced in the scaleup
was tested, all three batches had the same eﬀect when
compared with the previous studies, Figures 6(a) and 6(b).
It is important to mention that the results obtained with the
dose of 250mg/kg presented in Figure 4(a) are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the control group, although the AUC repre-
sentation did not demonstrate the same.
4.Discussion
This paper describes the isolation, puriﬁcation, characteriza-
tion, and pharmacological eﬀectsofthe chemical marker 2  -
O-rhamnosylswertisin andswertisin from leavesofA.moluc-
cana. Although these ﬂavonoids have been found in other

of each step in the phytomedicines development and also to
elucidate its pharmacological activity.
The methodology of SDE preparation in the pilot scale
shows reproducibility and feasibility for use in extract
productiononanindustrial scale.Also,the HPLC-developed
method allowed the standardization of the extract for the
future developmentof a phytomedicine.
The drugs used to treat chronic inﬂammatory conditions
are not as eﬀective and display pharmacological eﬀect acting
only on the inhibition of production of prostanoids but not
interfering with other important elements of the cascade of
inﬂammation. Thus, the pharmacological validation of nat-
ural products with established use in folk medicine in these
types of conditions is very important. The pharmacologic
eﬀect of SDE and the markers was evaluated in a model of
mechanical hypernociception induced by important ﬂogistic
agents such as carrageenan, PGE2,a n dC F A .O u rs t u d y
initially demonstrated the eﬀect of SDE in the mechanical
hypernociception induced by i.d. injection of carrageenan in
mice. Carrageenan is an inﬂammatory agent that is largely
used as pharmacological tool for investigating inﬂammatory
hyperalgesia in rats and mice [18]. When injected intrader-
mally on the plantar surface of animal’s hindpaw, it induces
an inﬂammatory process associated with hyperalgesia [19].
Tissue injury originating after the injection of carrageenan
involves the release of diﬀerent chemical mediators such as
PGE2 [20],mast cells productshistamine and serotonin [21],
neuropeptides [22], and cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β)[ 23],
among others [23]. This eﬀect was similar when compared
with animals treated with indomethacin. This result suggests
that SDE of A. moluccana may be interfering with diﬀerent
pathways involved in inﬂammatory pain signaling.
The eﬀect of SDE against inﬂammatory hypernocicep-
tion induced by i.d. injection of CFA and PGE2 was also
investigated. The CFA model has signiﬁcant proximity
with chronic inﬂammatory diseases in humans, such as
rheumatoidarthritis. Theinﬂammatory response inducedby
CFA develops rapidly and can persist for several weeks orEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9
months [14]. The hypernociceptive response is mediated by
local sensitization of nociceptors and also involves immune
response and changes in the central nervous system [24]. It
is now well established that inﬂammatory hypernociception,
such as that induced by PGE2, depends on the activation
of signalling pathways, which require neuronal activation
of PKA in neurons, downstream of the second messenger
cAMP [25]. Moreover, there many studies suggesting that
the PKC pathway also participates in nociceptor sensitiza-
tion, induced by nociceptive mediators, such as adrenaline,
endothelins, and bradykinin, as well as by more general
inﬂammation.
These pharmacological data reinforce the fact that part
of the antihypernocicepive eﬀect observed with dried extract
obtained from A. moluccana is probably due to the action
of the isolated compounds 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin and
swertisin. The role of ﬂavonoids in the eﬀects of A.
moluccana, modulating the nociceptive threshold, can be
hypothesized, since it has been extensively reported that this
class of compounds is responsible for the antiinﬂammatory
and anti-nociceptive eﬀects of several herbal products, such
as rutin, quercetin, and myricitrin, among others in animal
modelsofpain and acuteinﬂammation [26–28].Inaddition,
several ﬂavonoids, including quercetin and myricitrin are
also eﬀective in reducing hypernociception in models of
chronic inﬂammatory pain [29–31].
Previous studies conducted with the ﬂavonoid swertisin
revealed its potential as an agent that stimulates insulin
secretion presenting antihyperglycemic eﬀect [32], but no
analgesic studies with this ﬂavonoid have yet been con-
ducted; except for tge work in [33]d o n eo nt h eﬂ a v o n o i d -
enriched fraction from Cayaponia tayuya roots which
included swertisin.
Recent studies conducted at our laboratories have indi-
catedtheabsenceoftoxicologicaleﬀectsofthisextract intwo
diﬀerent animal species (unpublished results). In addition,
no cases of intoxication by this Aleurites species were found
in the literature [34].
It is also suggested that dried extract of A. moluc-
cana, dosed systemically, may be acting on the periph-
eral and/or on the central pathways of pain control. The
mechanisms through which A. Moluccana,a n di t sm a r k e r
2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin, exert their anti-hypernociceptive
actions are currently unclear and require further investiga-
tion; however, this could well constitute a new and attractive
alternative for the management of inﬂammatory pain in
humans using natural product. In view of the need for new
safe and eﬀective therapies, and taking into account the
adverse eﬀects associated with the drugs currently used, A.
moluccana represents an important and promising source of
herbal medicine for the treatment of pathologies for which
no eﬃcacious treatment exists, such as chronic pain.
5.Conclusion
The standardized dried extract of A. moluccana with 3%
of the marker 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin was obtained in a
reproducibility scaleup method. Furthermore, the extract
showed potential antinociceptive eﬀects in an experimental
model of inﬂammatory mechanical sensitization, using dif-
ferent inductor agent, such as λ-carrageenan, CFA, or PGE2
inmice.Thebiologicaleﬀectoftheextractmaybeattributed,
at least in part, to the marker 2  -O-rhamnosylswertisin and
to the other ﬂavonoid, swertisin, present in minor amounts.
These promising results support further studies aimed at
developing a new herbal medicine based on a tree used in
traditional folk medicine, contributing to the treatment of
painful processes.
