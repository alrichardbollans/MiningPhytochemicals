Abstract
Background: Solanum aculeastrum fruits are used by some cancer sufferers as a form of alternative treatment.
Scientific literature is scarce concerning its anticancer activity, and thus the aim of the study was to assess the in
vitro anticancer and P-glycoprotein inhibitory potential of extracts of S. aculeastrum fruits. Furthermore, assessment
of the combinational effect with doxorubicin was also done.
Methods: The crude extract was prepared by ultrasonic maceration. Liquid-liquid extraction yielded one aqueous
and two organic fractions. Bioactive constituents were isolated from the aqueous fraction by means of column
chromatography, solid phase extraction and preparative thin-layer chromatography. Confirmation of bioactive
constituent identity was done by nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry. The crude extract and fractions were assessed for cytotoxicity and P-glycoprotein inhibition in both
cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines using the sulforhodamine B and rhodamine-123 assays, respectively.
Results: Both the crude extract and aqueous fraction was cytotoxic to all cell lines, with the SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cell line being most susceptible to exposure (IC50 = 10.72 μg/mL [crude], 17.21 μg/mL [aqueous]).
Dose-dependent P-glycoprotein inhibition was observed for the crude extract (5.9 to 18.9-fold at 100 μg/mL) and
aqueous fraction (2.9 to 21.2 at 100 μg/mL). The steroidal alkaloids solamargine and solanine were identified. While
solanine was not bioactive, solamargine displayed an IC50 of 15.62 μg/mL, and 9.1-fold P-glycoprotein inhibition at
100 μg/mL against the SH-SY5Y cell line. Additive effects were noted for combinations of doxorubicin against the
SH-SY5Y cell line.
Conclusions: The crude extract and aqueous fraction displayed potent non-selective cytotoxicity and noteworthy
P-glycoprotein inhibition. These effects were attributed to solamargine. P-glycoprotein inhibitory activity was only
present at concentrations higher than those inducing cytotoxicity, and thus does not appear to be the likely
mechanism for the enhancement of doxorubicin’s cytotoxicity. Preliminary results suggest that non-selective
cytotoxicity may hinder drug development, however, further assessment of the mode of cell death is necessary to
determine the route forward.

Background
Cancer is a prominent contributor to worldwide mortal-
ity [1]. According to the World Health Organisation, 14.
1 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2012,
with 8.2 million cancer-related deaths reported between
2008 and 2012 [2]. In South Africa, more than 100,000
people are diagnosed with cancer annually, with prostate
and breast cancer as the most frequently found [2].
Anticancer therapy includes options such as surgical
interventions, radiation therapy and chemotherapy [1].
Due to cost, adverse effects [3, 4] and increasing resist-
ance, the above mentioned therapeutic options are often
subject to treatment failure [5]. Contributing resistance
mechanisms include, among others, the over-expression
of efflux transporters in cancer cells which aid in remov-
ing cytotoxins from the intracellular compartment [6].
The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter has been implicated
in such resistant cancer phenotypes [7]. P-gp is a 170 kDa
ATP-binding cassette membrane transporter which is
expressed throughout the body [8]. Up-regulation of P-gp
is associated with the majority of drug-resistant cancers,
as it effluxes anticancer molecules such as doxorubicin,
thus hindering its efficacy [7, 9].
Combination therapy has been suggested to counteract
resistance, which allows for drugs to be used together at
lower concentrations. This in turn may reduce side ef-
fects and potentially overcome resistance [10]. Doxo-
rubicin is used alone or in combination to treat several
cancers, solid tumours and soft tissue sarcomas [11].
However, with the increased frequency of cancer and
lack of clinical effectivity of many anticancer drugs,
novel treatments are sought [12]. Herbal remedies pro-
vide an ideal source of such chemical entities.
Complementary and alternative medicines are used
worldwide for treatment of various diseases [13]. Numerous
anticancer agents have been isolated from plants, or are de-
rivatives thereof: vinblastine and vincristine (Catharanthus
roseus); taxanes (Taxus canadensis); betulinic acid (Betula
spp.), etoposide (Podophyllum spp.) and combretastatin
(Combretum caffrum) [14–16]. Africa is a rich source of po-
tentially bioactive phytochemicals, giving credence to the
investigation of such herbal remedies against cancer.
The fruits of Solanum aculeastrum Dunal. (family
Solanaceae), also known as the goat apple, are some-
times consumed by cancer patients as they believe it will
be beneficial to treatment [17]. Literature concerning
the anticancer activity of extracts is scarce, however,
steroidal alkaloids such as solamargine have been shown
to possess such properties [18, 19]. The aim of the study
was to assess the in vitro anticancer activity of alkaloid-
enriched fractions from S. aculeastrum fruits by deter-
mining its cytotoxicity, P-gp inhibition, and effect in
combination with doxorubicin. Furthermore, the bio-
active constituents was isolated and identified.
Methods
Plant material
Ripened fruits of S. aculeastrum were gifted from the
Makana Botanical Gardens in Grahamstown (Eastern
Cape, South Africa), where the identity was confirmed
by Ms. Karin Cockburn. Specimens are available within
the botanical gardens, while plant material is stored
within the Department of Pharmacology as sectioned
and powdered plant material. Fruits were cut and air-
dried at ambient temperature. Plant material was ground
to a fine powder (Yellowline A10, Merck (Pty) Ltd) and
stored in air-tight, amber containers until needed.
Preparation of crude extract
Ground plant material (150 g) was sonicated in 1.5 L
methanol for 30 min, after which it was agitated for 2 h
on a shaker. The solution was incubated for an add-
itional 16 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and
the marc re-extracted five more times. Supernatants
were pooled, centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min, vacuum-
filtered (0.2 μm filters, Waters Corporation) and concen-
trated using in vacuo rotary evaporation (Büchi Rotova-
por R-200, Büchi). Dried crystals were resuspended in
distilled water (dH2O) and lyophilized (Freezone® 6
Freeze Dry System, Labconco) to yield a dry, yellow
powder (17.98% w/w).
Preparation of alkaloid-enriched fractions
Alkaloid-enriched fractions were prepared as described
by Munari et al. [20] with modifications to the volumes
used. Two organic fractions were obtained by sequential
liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether and chloro-
form. The crude extract (26.72 g) was acidified with 2%
acetic acid (267.2 mL) on a shaker for 2 h. Diethyl ether
(534.4 mL) was added to the acidified mixture, shaken for
20 min and the organic phase siphoned off after separ-
ation. This procedure was repeated four times, and all di-
ethyl ether fractions combined. After fractionation, the
aqueous phase was fractionated with chloroform as de-
scribed above. Organic fractions were clarified with an-
hydrous sodium sulphate (10% w/v). The two organic
fractions (diethyl ether [8.98% w/w] and chloroform [0.
15% w/w]) and the aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction
were concentrated using in vacuo rotary evaporation and
lyophilisation, respectively. All samples were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Aliquots (20 mg/mL) were
stored at -80 °C until needed.
Test for the presence of steroidal alkaloids
Samples (20 μg) were spotted onto a C10 silica plate (5 ×
10 cm, Agilent Technologies South Africa) and developed
in a mobile phase consisting of chloroform, acetone and
methanol (4:4:2). Plates were visualized using ultraviolet

light (UV, at 254 and 366 nm), sprayed with Dragendorff ’s
reagent and developed in an oven at 60 °C.
Cellular assays
Cell maintenance
The Caco-2, DU145, HepG2, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
SK-Br3, 3 T3-L1, C2C12 and SC-1 cell lines were ob-
tained from the American Tissue Culture Collection
(ATCC), while the A2780 cell line was obtained from
the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures.
The SH-SY5Y cell line was gifted from North-West Uni-
versity’s Department of Pharmacology, which was origin-
ally purchased from the ATCC. The Ea.hy926 cell line
was gifted by Dr. C Edgell.
Cells were grown in either Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM; 3 T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, C2C12 myo-
blast, EA.hy926 hybrid endothelial, MCF-7 breast carcin-
oma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines),
Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM; Caco-2
colon carcinoma, HepG2 hepatocarcinoma, SC-1 mouse
fibroblast cell lines), Hams F12 Nutrient Medium
(Hams-F12, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma) or Roswell Park
Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640; A2780 ovarian
carcinoma, DU145 prostate carcinoma, Sk-Br3 breast
adenocarcinoma) supplemented with 10% foetal calf
serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Adherent cells
were harvested through trypsination and centrifugation
at 200 g for 5 min. Cells were counted using the trypan
blue exclusion assay and resuspended at the desired con-
centration (HepG2 = 2 × 105 cells/mL; 3 T3-L1, A2780,
C2C12, Caco-2, DU145, EA.hy926, MCF-7, MDA-MB-
231, SC-1, Sk-BR-3 and SH-SY5Y = 1 × 105 cells/mL).
Cells (100 μL) were seeded into clear 96-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight.
Cytotoxicity evaluation
The effect of the crude extract and fractions on cell dens-
ity was determined using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) col-
ourimetric assay as described by Vichai and Kirtikura [21],
with minor modifications. Cells were exposed to 100 μL
FCS-free medium (negative control [NC]), DMSO (0.5%,
vehicle control [VC]), saponin (1%, positive control [PC])
or sample (2, 6.4, 20, 64 and 200 μg/mL) for 24 or 72 h.
Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 50 μL
trichloroacetic acid (50%). Plates were washed four times
with tap water and allowed to dry at 40 °C in an oven.
Fixed protein elements were stained with 100 μL SRB
(0.057% in 1% acetic acid) and incubated for 30 min.
Plates were washed with 100 μL acetic acid (1%)
thrice and allowed to dry. Bound dye was dissolved
with 200 μL Tris-base solution (10 mM, pH 10.5).
Absorbance was measured at 510 nm (reference
630 nm) using an ELX800UV plate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments, Inc.). Four cell lines were selected for
the remainder of the study based on the cytotoxicity
evaluation: the two most susceptible cancerous cell
lines (SH-SY5Y and SK-Br3), as well as one suscep-
tible (EA.hy926) and one non-susceptible (C2C12)
non-cancerous cell line.
P-glycoprotein inhibition
The rhodamine-123 accumulation assay was used to as-
sess P-gp inhibitory activity according to Jia and Wasan
[22] with modifications to volumes and incubation
times. Cells were seeded as described in Section 2.5.1.
and allowed to attach for 48 h in white 96-well plates.
Wells were exposed to 100 μL phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (blank and NC), DMSO (VC, 0.5%), samples (2, 6.
4, 20, 64 and 200 μg/mL) or verapamil (PC; 2, 6.4 and
20 μM) prepared in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.
After incubation, 40 μL rhodamine-123 (10 μM) was
added for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and re-
suspended in 100 μL PBS. Fluorescence was measured
using a FLUOstar OPTIMA plate reader (BMG Labtech)
at 485 nm (excitation) and 520 nm (emission). After
measurement, cell density was assessed using the SRB
assay to normalise data to avoid misinterpretation due
to altered cell density. Data was blank-excluded, fluores-
cence intensity normalised to cell density and expressed
as a fold change relative to the negative control.
Isolation of active compound
Bioassay-guided fractionation
The most active fraction (aqueous alkaloid-enriched
fraction) was subjected to high performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC; Agilent 1200 HPLC System, Agilent
Technologies South Africa) using acetonitrile and dH2O
(gradient: 0–10% acetonitrile between 0 and 5 min, to
100% at 30 min, total run time: 35 min) and a Sunfire
C18 semi-preparative column (150 mm × 10 mm, par-
ticle size: 10 μm). Samples (25 mg/mL) were repeatedly
injected and fractionated into eleven sub-fractions col-
lected every 2 min. Each sub-fraction was reconstituted
to the desired concentration in DMSO. Cytotoxicity and
P-gp inhibition was assessed against the SK-Br3 breast
carcinoma cell line at 50 μg/mL. Sub-fractions 10 and 11
were most active, and thus further assessed.
Isolation of active constituents by column and solid phase
extraction chromatography
Silica gel was mixed with chloroform and methanol
(3:2) and poured into a cotton wool plugged glass column
(2.7 × 50.5 cm). The aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction
was dissolved in a hydromethanolic solution (10% dH2O),
mixed with silica, left at room temperature to dry and
loaded on top of the packed silica gel column. Sub-
fractions were collected in glass tubes, monitored using
Burger et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2018) 18:137 Page 3 of 11
TLC, and compared to sub-fractions 10 and 11 as refer-
ence. Similar sub-fractions were pooled together and fur-
ther purified by solid phase extraction chromatography
using a ISOLUTE flash C18 column with a mobile phase
of acetonitrile and dH2O (starting at 100% dH2O, followed
by 5% acetonitrile, then 10% acetonitrile and increasing to
100% acetonitrile in 10% increments). Major compounds
co-eluted at 40% acetonitrile as a white-powder and were
separated using preparative TLC (solvent system: metha-
nol, ethyl acetate and acetone; 4:4:2) to afford compound
1 and compound 2.
The identities of the isolated compounds were con-
firmed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR,
600 MHz VNMRS, Varian) and Ultra-Performance Liquid
Chromatography Tandem Mass-Spectrometry (Synapt G1
UPLC-QTOF-HDMS system, Waters, USA) analysis.
Compounds were analysed using different NMR tech-
niques such as H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, Heteronuclear Sin-
gle Quantum Coherence (HSQC), Heteronuclear Multiple
Bond Correlation (HMBC) and correlation spectroscopy
(COSY) to accurately determine structural moieties. Mass
Lynx 4.1 software was used for analysis of mass spectrom-
etry data and the fragmentation patterns of the isolated
compounds were identified using Waters MassFragment
software (version 2.0.w.15).
UPLC-TOF-MS fingerprinting of the crude extract and
alkaloid-enriched fractions
Samples (20 mg/mL) were subjected to UPLC-QTOF-
HDMS analysis in order to screen for major constitu-
ents. The relative abundance of the major compounds
was compared between samples by equalising the inten-
sity scale between chromatograms of different samples.
The highest sample intensity was used as the scale
standard for other chromatograms.
Bioactivity
Compounds 1 and 2 (0.32, 1, 3.2, 32 and 50 μg/mL)
were assessed for cytotoxicity against the C2C12, EA.
hy29, SH-SY5Y and SK-Br3 cell lines after 72 h expos-
ure. P-gp inhibitory activity was assessed in the SH-
SY5Y and EA.hy926 cell lines only. Only the most active
compound was subjected to synergistic investigation
with doxorubicin.
Synergistic potential evaluation of the aqueous alkaloid-
enriched fraction and active isolated compound in
combination with doxorubicin
The synergistic potential of the aqueous alkaloid-
enriched fraction and active compound in combination
with doxorubicin was assessed using the method of Kars
et al. [23]. The half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of the aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction was
reassessed, as well as the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin
against the C2C12, EA.hy29, SH-SY5Y and SK-Br3 cell
lines. The active isolated compound, aqueous alkaloid-
enriched fraction and doxorubicin was tested at two-,
one-, half- and a quarter-fold the respective IC50 values
in a checkerboard fashion.
Effects of the combination between doxorubicin and
the extract/fractions were presented as a fractional in-
hibitory index (FIX):
FIX ¼ FIC Að Þ þ FIC Bð Þ
A FIX value < 0.5 is indicative of synergism, between 0.
5–1 as additive effect, between 1 and 2 as an indifferent
effect and > 2 as antagonism.
Statistics
All experiments were performed with technical and bio-
logical triplicates. Results were presented as the mean ±
SEM. Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad
Prism 5.0. Non-linear regression was used to determine
the IC50. Kruskal-Wallis analysis with a post-hoc Dunn’s
test was used to compare controls to samples. Signifi-
cance was taken as p < 0.05.
Results
Isolation and structural elucidation of steroidal alkaloids
Intense black and violet spots were observed for the
crude extract and alkaloid-enriched fraction on TLC
plates under short (254 nm) and long (366 nm)-wave-
length UV light, respectively. Orange spots were seen
after spraying with Dragendorff ’s reagent. The aqueous
alkaloid-enriched fraction was sub-fractionated into
eleven fractions. Two major compounds were identified
in sub-fractions 10 and 11, which were not visible under
UV light, but appeared after vanillin-spraying.
Compound 1 appeared as white crystals. The structure
of compound 1 was identified by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR,
2-D data analysis. C-13-NMR revealed that compound 1
possesses an aglycone backbone related to a steroidal
spirazolane-type alkaloid. Four quaternary carbons at
chemical shifts (δc’s) 38.2, δc 41.8 ppm including one
linked to oxygen and nitrogen at δc 99.6 as well as one
attached to a double bond at δc 142.1, nine methine
groups at δc’s 31.8, 31.8, 42.9, 51.9, 57.9, 64.2, 79.5, 80.5,
122.8, ten methylene groups at δc’s 22.2, 30.9, 31.1, 32.9,
33.1, 33.4, 38.7, 39.7, 41.2, 48.5 ppm and four methyl
groups at δc’s 15.6, 17.0, 19.9, 19.9 ppm were observed
(Table 1). An ether function with a trisaccharide moiety
showing an anomeric carbon at δc 100.6 linked to the
oxygen of C-3 at δc 79.5 was also present (Table 1). The
1D NMR chemical shifts of the trisaccharide moiety in-
dicated the structure O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→ 2)-
O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→ 4)]-β-D-glucopyranoside.

methyls at δc 0.83 (3H, s), 0.85 (3H, d, J [coupling con-
stant] 6.4), 0.97 (3H, d, J 7.2) and 1.05 (3H, s) (Table 1).
Two multiplets observed at δc 1.26 were attributable to
6-deoxyhexose methyls whereas a doublet at δc 5.38 with
J value of 4.6 could be attributed to an olefinic proton at
position C-6. Four anomeric H-1-NMR resonances were
observed at δc 4.34 (1H, m), 4.50 (1H, d, J 7.6), 4.84 (1H,
s) and 5.21 (1H, s) (Table 1). High resolution mass spec-
trometry (HRMS) data for compound 1 yielded the mo-
lecular formula C45H73NO15 with a molecular mass of m/z
(mass to charge ratio) 868.5077 ([M+H]+, 100%) which
was identified as the steroidal alkaloid, solamargine (Fig. 1).
Extensive evaluation of the similarities in characteristic
signals of the H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and 2-D NMR for
compound 2 revealed that it was like compound 1. The
structure included an aglycone backbone attached to a
trisaccharide moiety. However, differences were present
in the trisaccharide sugar moiety in which a O-[α-L-
rhamnopyranosyl-(1→ 2)-O-[b-glucopyranosyl-(1→ 3)
]-β-D-galactopyranoside structure was observed. HRMS
data for compound 2 yielded the molecular formula
C45H73NO16 with molecular weight peak at m/z 884.5205
([M +H]+, 100%) which was identified as the steroidal
alkaloid solasonine (Fig. 1). The mass difference between
solasonine and solamargine is consistent with the
additional hydroxyl group seen in solasonine’s structure.
UPLC-QTOF-HDMS analysis of the crude extract and
alkaloid-enriched fractions revealed that solamargine and
solasonine with m/z’s of 868.4987 and 884.4989 ([M +H]+,
100%), respectively, were the two major constituents.
Although there were similarities in composition between
samples, the concentration of major compounds differed.
The crude extract and aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction
had a significantly higher abundance of solamargine and
solasonine when compared to the chloroform and ether
fractions.
Cytotoxicity
Samples were cytotoxic in cancerous (A2780, Caco-2,
DU-145, HepG2, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SH-SY5Y and
SK-Br3) and non-cancerous (3 T3-L1, C2C12, EA.hy.926
and SC-1) cell lines (Table 2). The crude extract and

aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction displayed noteworthy
(< 30 μg/mL) and moderate-to-low cytotoxicity (> 30 μg/
mL) after 72 h exposure (Table 2). In most cell lines,
cytotoxicity was evident as early as 24 h exposure, which
either plateaued or decreased (1-to-2-fold increase) after
72 h exposure. Variable cytotoxicity towards non-
cancerous cell lines was observed, with IC50 values from 3.
88 to 93.41 μg/mL and 2.79 to 91.18 μg/mL after 24 h and
72 h exposure, respectively. The chloroform and diethyl
ether fractions had negligible cytotoxicity. The aqueous
alkaloid-enriched fraction had a potent dose-
dependent effect on the SH-SY5Y (IC50 = 17.21 μg/
mL), Sk-Br3 (IC50 = 18.81 μg/mL) and HepG2 (IC50 =
20.66 μg/mL, Table 2) cell lines, but displayed low
cytotoxicity in the C2C12 (IC50 = 62.00 μg/mL) cell
line after 72 h exposure. The EA.hy926 cell line was
most susceptible to the aqueous alkaloid-enriched
fraction with an IC50 of 9.35 μg/mL after 72 h, with a
narrow cytotoxic range.
Sub-fractions 10 and 11 from the aqueous alkaloid-
enriched fraction displayed potent cytotoxicity (~ 91%)
at 50 μg/mL in the SK-Br3 cell line. Bioactivity-guided
fractionation and isolation procedures identified sola-
margine as the bioactive constituent. Solamargine in-
duced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y and
SK-Br3 cell lines with IC50 values of 15.62 μM (13.
54 μg/mL) and 18.59 μM (16.12 μg/mL) after 72 h incu-
bation, respectively (Table 2). Solasonine was not cyto-
toxic (IC50 > 56.63 μM or 50 μg/mL).
P-glycoprotein inhibition
The crude extract and the aqueous alkaloid-enriched frac-
tion induced dose-dependent P-gp inhibition (2.87 to 21.
2-fold) at 100 μg/mL (Fig. 2A and D). The chloroform and
diethyl ether fraction displayed poor P-gp inhibition (1.12
to 1.63-fold). The diethyl ether, chloroform and aqueous
alkaloid-enriched fractions showed the greatest inhibitory
potential towards the SH-SY5Y cell line (Fig. 2B to 2D)
with inhibition of 1.26, 1.64 and 21.21-fold at 100 μg/mL,
respectively. The fractions exhibited the lowest activity to-
wards the C2C12 cell line with inhibitory values of 1.13, 1.
27 and 2.87-fold at 100 μg/mL, respectively. The aqueous
alkaloid-enriched fraction displayed inhibitory activity
across all cell lines, with values of 2.82 to 21.21-fold at
100 μg/mL (p < 0.001). The P-gp inhibition exhibited by
the crude extract and aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction
was similar (5.89 to 18.88-fold at 100 μg/mL [p < 0.001]).
Significant (p < 0.05 and 0.001) but low P-gp inhibition
was induced by the chloroform fraction in the SH-SY5Y
cancerous cell line (Fig. 2C) with an inhibitory value of 1.
64-fold at 100 μg/mL. The diethyl ether fraction displayed
low but significant (p < 0.01) inhibition in the EA.hy926
cell line of 1.47-fold at 100 μg/mL. No significant activity
was noted for any other cell line tested.
Solamargine caused significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001)
dose-dependent P-gp inhibition in the SH-SY5Y cancer-
ous cell line (Fig. 3A) with 5.07-fold activity at 36.9 μM
(32 μg/mL) and 9.10-fold activity at 57.7 μM (50 μg/
mL). However, the effect was 3.95-fold less when

compared to the aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction (13.
05-fold) at 50 μg/mL (Fig. 3A). Solamargine inhibited P-
gp more in the EA.hy926 (13.81-fold) non-cancerous cell
line when compared to the SH-SY5Y (9.05-fold) cancer-
ous cell line at 57.70 μM (50 μg/mL). Solasonine did not
inhibit P-gp activity (Fig. 3B).
Synergistic potential of the aqueous alkaloid-enriched
fraction and solamargine with doxorubicin
A dose-dependent decrease in cell density was observed
after exposure to doxorubicin, with more selectivity to-
wards cancerous cell lines (Table 3). SH-SY5Y cells were
most susceptible to doxorubicin (IC50 of 56.60 nM). No
synergistic effects were observed between doxorubicin and
the aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction or solamargine
(Table 3). Additive effects were observed in the SH-SY5Y
cell line for the doxorubicin combinations with the aqueous
alkaloid-enriched fraction (FIX value = 0.71) and solamar-
gine (FIX value = 0.51). Additive effects were also observed
in the SK-Br3 and EA.hy926 cell lines when exposed to the
combination with solamargine (FIX value = 0.66) and the
aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction (FIX value = 0.94), re-
spectively. In contrast, antagonistic effects were observed in
the C2C12 cell line when exposed to combinations with the
aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction (FIX value = 2.10) and
solamargine (FIX value = 2.53). Indifferent effects were
noted when the SK-Br-3 and EA.hy926 cell lines were ex-
posed to the combination with the aqueous alkaloid-
enriched fraction and solamargine, respectively (Table 3,
FIX values: > 1, however < 2).

light and Dragendorff ’s reagent. Dragendorff ’s reagent is
known to produce orange spots when reacting with alka-
loids [24, 25]. Literature supports the presence of such al-
kaloids in S. aculeastrum [26]. The two most prominent
steroidal alkaloids, solamargine (compound 1) and solaso-
nine (compound 2), were isolated. Structural analysis was
found to compare well with literature [19, 27]. According
to literature, more than 100 Solanum spp., including S.
aculeastrum, contain solamargine and solasonine [28].
Other compounds isolated from S. aculeastrum include
the steroidal alkaloids, solaculine A, solasodine and toma-
tidine [19, 26]. Solanopubamine and solanidine have also
been noted in other Solanum spp. [29, 30].
Both the crude extract and aqueous alkaloid-enriched
fraction were highly cytotoxic in the panel of cell lines.
A mixture of concentration- and time-dependent cyto-
toxicity was observed. A few isolated studies have
assessed the cytotoxicity of S. aculeastrum, but not as
broad as in the present study. Koduru et al. [17] re-
ported that a methanol fruit extract displayed a narrow
cytotoxic range, with an IC50 of 17.8 μg/mL in the MCF-
7 cell line [17]. Although the present study displayed
greater cytotoxicity (IC50 = 10.14 μg/mL), a narrow cyto-
toxic range was also observed. Other Solanum species,
such as S. nigrum and S. incanum, have also been shown
to be cytotoxic [31, 32]. S. incanum has been shown to
induce both an antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect via
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [32].
The cytotoxicity observed for solamargine in the
present study is similar to that described in literature
(between 5.28 to 21.03 μM [4.58 to 18.23 μg/mL]) [20].
Solamargine alters cell morphology, induce chromatin
condensation, and fragment DNA in hepatoma (Hep3B)
cells, suggesting a pro-apoptotic effect [33]. Apoptosis
appears to occur via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
pathways in breast cancer cells [34]. Furthermore, sola-
margine induces extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) with downstream cytotoxicity
in human lung cancer [35]. Solamargine may also deter
metastatic effects in cancer by reducing its invasive and
migratory potential [36]. In the present study, solasonine
was not cytotoxic. Conflicting results have been re-
ported, which either support [37] or contradict [20] the
current findings. Conformational changes in solasonine’s
molecular structure could account for the differences in
cytotoxicity [38].
The non-selective cytotoxicity observed for the sam-
ples render the extracts and solamargine as poor candi-
dates for further drug development, unless structural
alterations could improve its selectivity for cancerous
cell lines. Similar results were reported by Munari et al.
[20], where an ethanol extract from S. lycocarpum fruits,
as well as solamargine, displayed antiproliferative effects
towards human and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell
lines [20].
The crude extract and aqueous alkaloid-enriched frac-
tion displayed prominent P-gp inhibitory activity, which
could be ascribed to the presence of solamargine, how-
ever, other phytochemcials cannot be excluded. The P-
gp inhibitory activity was only seen at concentrations
greater than that inducing cytotoxic effects, and also dis-
played non-selective inhibition. Literature is scarce re-
garding P-gp inhibitory activity of Solanum spp. An
ethanol extract from S. trilobatum was found to induce

significant (p < 0.05) inhibition when compared to verap-
amil, however, only at 300 μg/mL [39]. This species also
contains solamargine and solasodine, which are known
to diminish P-gp function [40]. Solamargine has been
shown to decrease MDR1 mRNA expression [41], and
reduce P-gp expression [40]. P-gp expression has been
linked to the structural integrity of cells [42], suggesting
that the loss of cellular morphology may contribute to
the inhibition observed. Other steroidal alkaloids, such
as tomatidine and cyclopamine, have also been found to
inhibit P-gp [42]. Steroidal alkaloids may act as non-
competitive inhibitors of P-gp. Active transport of com-
pounds across the cellular membrane occurs at two dis-
tinct sites (H and R) in the transmembrane region [43].
Since steroidal alkaloids are small compounds, which
possess a nitrogen atom and have a planar structure,
they diffuse rapidly into cells. As such, compounds may
interact easily with membrane carriers or transporters
[43], decreasing activity.
Solamargine was shown to enhance the cytotoxic effect
of doxorubicin in both SH-SY5Y and SK-Br3 cancerous
cell lines. This potentiated response was not observed in
non-cancerous cell lines, which suggests solamargine may
be effective in improving treatment regimens for both
neuroblastoma and certain breast cancers. As previously
mentioned, in the present study P-gp inhibition only
occurred at cytotoxic concentrations, thus enhancement
of doxorubicin cytotoxic effects through P-gp inhibition
seems improbable at the concentrations tested. The addi-
tive effects observed in the present study may indicate that
the samples and doxorubicin target the similar pathways.
Both doxorubicin and the samples have been proposed to
mediate cell death via apoptosis. An antagonistic inter-
action would, such as that seen in the C2C12 cell line,
suggests conflicting mechanisms on the same pathway
[44]. Other species of Solanum have also been shown to
provide conflicting combinational effects. For example,
both synergistic and antagonistic interactions have been
described for extracts of S. nigrum [45, 46]. The bioactive
constituents are proposed to be steroidal alkaloids, such
as solamargine [47], which is known to increase the cyto-
toxicity of anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin [48]. Chaco-
nine and solanine [49], as well as other P-gp inhibitors
[50, 51] display similar effects.
Conclusions
The crude extract, as well as the aqueous alkaloid-enriched
fraction, displayed noteworthy cytotoxicity and P-gp inhib-
ition towards both cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines.
Solamargine was found to be responsible for potent, non-
selective cytotoxicity and P-gp inhibition. Solamargine and
the aqueous alkaloid-enriched fraction enhanced doxorubi-
cin’s cytotoxicity through additive effects in select cell lines,
whereas having indifferent and antagonistic responses in
others. P-gp inhibition only occurred at concentrations
higher than those eliciting cytotoxicity, suggesting an al-
ternative mechanism underlying its additive effect with
doxorubicin. Due to the non-selective bioactivity, further
mechanistic studies are required to address the preliminary
results so that drug development viability can be assessed.
