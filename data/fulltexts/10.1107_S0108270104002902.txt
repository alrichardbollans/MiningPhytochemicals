The title compound, C16H13N3, isolated from Justicia secunda
(Acanthaceae), comprises two molecules (which differ slightly
in conformation) in the asymmetric unit of space group P1.
Intermolecular NaminoÐH  Npyrm interactions (Npyrm is a
pyrimidine ring N atom) involve only one of the two donor
amino H atoms and pyrimidine N atoms per molecule, forming
dimeric units via R22(8) rings, with N  N distances of 3.058 (2)
and 3.106 (3) AÊ , and NÐH  N angles of 172.7 (18) and
175.8 (17). The dimers are linked by CÐH  (arene)
contacts, with an H  centroid distance of 2.77 AÊ and a
CÐH  centroid angle of 141.
Comment
The title compound, 4,6-diphenyl-2-pyrimidinylamine, (I), was
isolated as a natural product from the plant Justicia secunda
(Acanthaceae) collected in Trinidad, West Indies. The parent
structure, viz. 4,6-diphenyl-1,2-dihydropyrimidine, has been
reported (Weis & Vishkautsan, 1985), but the coordinates are
not in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Allen, 2002)
for comparison with (I) (CSD refcode DEZMEA for parent
compound).
Compound (I) crystallizes in space group P1 (No. 2) with
two independent molecules, A and B, in the asymmetric unit,
which differ slightly in conformation (Fig. 1). Bond lengths
and angles are largely unexceptional and in accord with
anticipated values (Orpen et al., 1994); selected dimensions
are given in Table 1. The central CÐN bond lengths range
from 1.340 (2) to 1.346 (2) AÊ , while the aromatic CÐC
distances are in the range 1.381 (3)±1.387 (3) AÊ . Torsion-angle
differences are evident from analysis of the N1ÐC4ÐC21Ð
C26 angles, which are ÿ29.8 (3) and 36.5 (3) in molecules A
and B, respectively (Table 1). Even more dramatic is the
difference in dihedral angles between the C11±C16 and C21±
C26 planes, which are 52.15 (7) and 31.79 (7) in molecules A
and B, respectively. The weighted (unit weight) r.m.s. ®t for
the superposition of the non-H atoms in both molecules is
0.65 AÊ (0.55 AÊ ) (Spek, 2003).
Molecules A and B associate in pairs through NaminoÐ
H  Npyrm intermolecular interactions (Npyrm is a pyrimidine
ring N atom), which only involve two of the four amino donor
H atoms and N pyrimidine acceptors per A/B pair. The N  N
distances are 3.058 (2) and 3.106 (3) AÊ , and the NÐH  N
angles are 172.7 (18) and 175.8 (17) (Table 2), thus forming a
hydrogen-bonded ring with an R22(8) graph set similar to that
observed in centrosymmetric carboxylic acid pairs. A CÐ
H  (arene) contact from C12AÐH12A to the C21A±C26A
ring links the dimeric units into a dimer of dimers, which is
further augmented via a contact from C26AÐH26A group to
the N1A/N2A/C1A±C4A ring into a one-dimensional stack
(Fig. 2 and Table 2). These are the only contacts of note in the
structure of (I), apart from the NÐH  N hydrogen bonding.
Examination of the structure of (I) for interactions invol-
ving N2A/N2B reveals that, along the b direction, atom H24A
(a potential donor) is 2.99 AÊ from N2Ai, with a C24AÐ
H24A  N2Ai angle of 163 [symmetry code: (i) x, 1 + y, z].
Likewise, the closest N  H intermolecular distance involving
atom N2B is N2B  H24Bi of 3.08 AÊ , with an N2B  H24BiÐ
C24Bi angle of 155. Neither of these interactions constitutes a
hydrogen bond.
Inspection of Fig. 2 shows the dimeric units in a two-
dimensional cross-section through the crystal structure
parallel to the [101] plane. In the crystal structure, a more
ef®cient packing could involve dimer formation about inver-
sion centres, which would necessitate rotation of the phenyl
rings to align and ful®l symmetry requirements, e.g. the phenyl
rings have interplanar angles of 52.12 (7) and 31.79 (7) in
molecules A and B, respectively. The reason why this does not
arise is due to the initial hydrogen-bonded dimer formation.
Utilization of only half of the NÐH  N donor/acceptors per
A/B hydrogen-bonded dimer prevents the N2A/N2B pair from
forming hydrogen bonds, as potential (C)NÐH  N donor/
acceptor pairs cannot approach one another and because of
the concurrent formation of unfavourable H  H contacts.
Interactions in (I) are therefore limited to the two NÐH  N
interactions per A/B pair.
Ab initio calculations on (I) gave results similar to those
observed in molecules A and B. Calculations were undertaken
at the 6-31+G(d) level in the search for a local minimum for
comparison with molecules A and B, using GAUSSIAN03
(Frisch et al., 2003). The NÐCÐCÐC torsion angles are
27.55, similar to the value of ÿ29.8 (3) found in molecule A.

The H2NÐC distance is 1.362 AÊ and the NÐCÐN angle is
116.79 [range 116.15 (17)±117.05 (17) in molecule A].
Overall, the calculated results resemble those of molecule A.
However, no attempt was made to ®nd the global minimum in
the system.
Crystal structures with more than one molecule present in
the asymmetric unit are not uncommon (Steiner, 2000;
Gallagher et al., 1998). Recently, GoÈ rbitz (2002, 2003) has
reported on dipeptide derivatives, e.g. two forms of
l-valyl-l-phenylalanine trihydrate (P21, Z = 16, Z
0 = 8; P212121,
Z = 4, Z0 = 1) and l-methionyl-l-alanine (P61, Z = 42, Z0 = 7),
which provide rare examples of systems with Z0 = 8 and 7
molecules in their respective asymmetric units, in contrast with
Z0 = 2, which is not uncommon. Analysis of the CSD
(February 2004, version 5.25; Allen, 2002) reveals a total of
65 935 crystal structures in space group P1 (No. 2) (and
equivalents with no restrictions), 7625 with Z0 > 1, some 11.6%
of the total, and 6775 with Z0 = 2. No attempt was made to
examine incorrect space groups.
Experimental
The plant Justicia secunda (Acanthaceae) was collected in Trinidad,
West Indies, and dried at 308±313 K. A large quantity (1 kg) of this
dried powdered plant (except root and ¯ower/fruit) was placed in a
large separating funnel and soaked in acetone overnight. The acetone
layer was collected and the process repeated until the acetone layer
became faintly green in colour. The combined acetone extracts were
evaporated and the dry mass extracted with benzene. The benzene-
soluble fraction was dried, dissolved in the minimum amount of dry
warm CHCl3 and spread over activated silica gel in a sintered glass
Buchner funnel. It was then eluted with 50 ml portions of benzene
and then a CHCl3±benzene mixture (1:4) under a slight vacuum. The
fraction obtained from CHCl3±benzene (1:4) was collected and the
solvent removed. It was then subjected to column chromatography
with light petroleum (b.p. 313±333 K) and benzene. After concen-
tration, the benzene fraction yielded gummy crystals upon refrig-
eration. These crystals were further puri®ed by preparative
chromatography to afford the pure title compound, (I), as well
shaped crystals from CHCl3.

Compound (I) crystallized in the triclinic system, the systematic
absences permitting space group P1 or P1; P1 was assumed and
con®rmed by the analysis. All H atoms bonded to C atoms were
treated as riding atoms, with CÐH distances of 0.93 AÊ , while the four
amino H atoms were re®ned with isotropic displacement parameters,
giving NÐH distances in the range 0.89 (2)±0.91 (2) AÊ .
