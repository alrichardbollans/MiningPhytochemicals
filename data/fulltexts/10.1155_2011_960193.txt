Abstract: Ginger rhizome (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has many diverse 
properties and medicinal values such as antioxidant potential combined with 
the properties of a spice. Dried ginger (DG) were extracted with aqueous 
ethanol and freeze-dried. The extract was evaluated for antioxidant potential, 
using 1,1’-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical scavenging, antioxidant capacity 
and reducing power assays. DG extract was further fractionated into methanol 
(Mfr) and water-soluble (Wfr) fractions. The Mfr exhibited higher antioxidant 
capacity when compared to DG extract. Higher antioxidant potential of the 
methanol fraction may be due to the presence higher polyphenols and [6]-
gingerol content. This suggests that alcoholic soluble fraction possess 
enormous scope to enhance the antioxidant potential when used as a 
supplement in various food as well as pharmaceutical formulations / products. 
Keywords: Ginger, Antioxidants enriched fraction, Polyphenols, 6-Gingerol. 
Introduction 
Species from Zingiberaceae family have been widely used as spices. Ginger (Zingiber 
officinale Rosc) is used in traditional oriental medicine for common cold, digestive 
disorders, and rheumatism1,2. Fresh as well as dried forms of ginger have been used both in 
medicine and in culinary for flavour and pungency. India is the largest producer (380.0 
thousand tonnes) and consumer of ginger and contributing 35% of the world production3. 
 Antioxidants from natural resources are associated with health benefits against heart 
diseases, malaria, neuro-degenerative diseases, AIDS, cancer and longevity4. Solvent 
extraction is the commonly used method for the extraction of bioactive components from 
plant sources. The selection of solvent system for the extraction will depend on the purpose 
of extraction, nature of the compounds, safety concerns and so on5.

The objective of the present study was to separate antioxidant-enriched fraction from ginger 
and to evaluate antioxidant potential. Ginger extract was prepared from dried ginger and 
antioxidants were enriched using solvent partition. Extracts and fractions were evaluated for 
their antioxidant potential in different in vitro model systems.  
Experimental 
Gallic acid, DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) were procured from Sigma Chemicals 
Co., USA. All other chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade available 
commercially. Absorbance was measured using a UV visible spectrophotometer (Cintra 10, 
GBC, Australia). 
Plant collection 
Fresh ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc) rhizomes were procured from local market, Mysore, 
India. A Voucher specimen (CFTRI-PPSFT-Ginger 1) was deposited in Herbarium of our 
department. The rhizomes were soaked in potassium metabisulphite solution, washed with 
water and sliced. The slices were subjected to dehydration using cross flow drier at 50 °C for 
6 h. and powdered.   
Preparation of extract from ginger 
Ginger powder (4 kg) was loaded into stainless steel column and extracted with aqueous 
ethanol (50%). The material to solvent ratio was kept as 1:6 to 1:9.  The combined extracts 
were concentrated in the solvent distillation unit. Alcohol-free extract was dried in a freeze 
dryer (Lyodryer, LT5B, Lyophilisation systems Inc. USA) at a temperature of 40 °C and at 
0.312 millibar pressure. The crude extract (DG) was successively partitioned into methanol 
(Mfr) and water (Wfr) fractions. All the fractions were stored at -20 °C. 
Antioxidant assays 
The extracts and the fractions were evaluated for antioxidant potential through in vitro 
models such as radical scavenging activity (1,1’-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical), 
reducing power (iron reducing activity) and antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum 
complex). Also, the fractions were analysed for total phenol content and 6-gingerol.  
Radical scavenging activity  
The extract and the fractions were evaluated for radical scavenging ability using the stable 
radical DPPH• according to the method of Blois6. Different concentrations of the DG 
extract, fractions (Mfr and Wfr) and BHA solution (each 1 mL) were taken in different test 
tubes. Four milliliters of 0.1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH was added to these tubes, 
shaken vigorously and allowed to stand at 27 °C for 20 min. Absorbance of the samples was 
measured at 517 nm against the absorbance of the control. Radical scavenging activity was 
calculated using the equation,  
Radical Scavenging activity (%) = (1- Asample/ Acontrol) X100. 
Reducing power 
The reducing power of the extracts was evaluated7.  Briefly, 1 mL of various concentrations 
(25–200 µg) of standard or test compound in distilled water was mixed with phosphate 
buffer (2.5 mL, 0.2 mol/L., pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide (2.5 mL, 1%). The mixture 
was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Trichloroacetic acid (10%, 2.5 mL) was added to the 
mixture, which was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.  The  upper  layer  of the solution 
Antioxidant Enriched Fractions from Zingiber Officinale Roscoe 723 
(2.5 mL) was mixed with distilled water (2.5 mL) and FeCl3 (0.5 mL, 0.1%) and the 
absorbance was measured at 700 nm. Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates 
increased reduction capability. 
Antioxidant capacity 
The total antioxidant capacity of DG extract and fractions (Mfr and Wfr) along with the 
commercial standard antioxidant propyl gallate were evaluated8. An aliquot of 0.01-0.2 mL 
solutions (containing 25-200 µg of extract) was made up to 4 mL using reagent solution 
(0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate and 4 mM ammonium molybdate). The 
tubes were capped and incubated in a boiling water-bath at 95 °C for 90 min. The samples 
were cooled to room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 695 nm against blank. 
The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was expressed as equivalents of ascorbic acid 
(µmol/g of extract). 
Total phenols 
The phenolic content was determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) method9. The 
concentrations of total phenols in extracts were measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer 
(Cintra 10, GBC, Australia), according to a colorimetric oxidation/reduction reaction. To the 
extracts (1 µg/µL), FC reagent (500 µL) and 20% saturated sodium carbonate solution 
(1500 µL) were added to the tubes and the mixture was made up to 10 mL with distilled 
water. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm 
using a spectrophotometer. The results are expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE).  
High performance liquid chromatographic analysis 
The ginger extract were analyzed on a HPLC system consisting of a Shimadzu system 
controller SCL-10A VP, Shimadzu diode Array Detector (SPD-M 10A VP) and a Shimadzu 
liquid chromatograph LC-10AT. Chromatographic analysis was performed on a Waters 
Spherisorb C-18 reversed phase column (ODS 2, 4.6 mm×250 mm, 5 µm) with acetonitrile – 
water (55:45, v/v) as the mobile phase. The HPLC operating parameters were as follows, 
injection volume, 10 µL; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min. The eluting compounds were detected at 
λmax of 280 nm on PDA detector10,11. DG extracts and Mfr (10 mg/mL) were dissolved in 
methanol and injected (10 µL). Duplicate injections were performed to ensure accuracy and 
reproducibility.  [6]-gingerol was isolated from Mfr and the structure elucidated employing 
NMR spectral data (unpublished). A standard calibration curve of gingerol was constructed 
at different concentrations using HPLC. [6]-gingerol content of the samples was determined 
using this calibration curve. 
Statistical analysis 
Experimental results were carried out in triplicate and the results are shown as mean 
value ± standard deviation. The obtained data were submitted to statistical analysis and 
means were compared by the Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test (p≤0.05) and 
presented.   
Results and Discussion 
Extraction of dried ginger using aqueous ethanol resulted in 15% yield, which is higher than 
the result (4.01%) reported12 using distilled ethanol. It was further fractionated into methanol 
(Mfr) and water (Wfr). The yields and total phenolic contents (as percent gallic acid 
equivalents) of extract as well as the fractions are presented in the Table 1.

 The DPPH• scavenging activity of the extracts was concentration-dependent (Figure 1).  
Mfr showed significantly higher radical scavenging activity (RSA) (77.97±1.25%) than DG 
extract (42.80±0.51%) and Wfr (10.74±0.78%) at 50 µg/mL concentrations. This is in good 
agreement with the result obtained from the literature13-15 where methanol extract showed 
maximum activity for pomegranate peel, coffee and cinnamon fruits.

 The reducing power of extracts showing same degree of electron donation capacity in a 
concentration-dependent manner, but the capacities was inferior to that of ascorbic acid (AA) and 
BHA. The absorbance readings measured at 700 nm at 50 µg/mL indicated (Figure 2) that the 
Mfr showed higher reducing power compared to DG and Wfr. The reducing capacity of a 
compound may serve as a significant indicator of its potential antioxidant activity14.

 The antioxidant capacities of the dried ginger (DG) were found to be 1341±122 µmol/ g 
(ascorbic acid equivalents) and lower to that of propyl gallate (Figure 3). The Mfr exhibited 
higher antioxidant capacity (3343.47±131.65 µmol/ g) and was comparable to that of propyl 
gallate. The Wfr showed the least antioxidant capacity (545.46±14.03 µmol/ g). Higher 
capacity of the Mfr may be due to the presence of higher quantity of polyphenols.

 Correlation studies between the total polyphenols content and antioxidant activities 
showed a positive and significant correlation (p<0.05) between the polyphenolic content and 
RSA. The results also confirm that the polyphenolic compounds are responsible for other 
activities such as reducing power and antioxidant capacity in ginger. [6]-Gingerol is the most 
abundant (80-90%) and important pungent compound among the other gingerols present in 
fresh and dry ginger products16. [6]-Gingerol was isolated from the ginger extract and the 
structure elucidation was carried using NMR spectral analysis17 (Table 2). [6]-Gingerol at five 
different concentrations was analyzed and peak area responses were noted (average of two 
independent injections). Calibration curve was plotted for concentration versus peak area 
response.  [6]- Gingerol content was calculated using the standard curve. DG extract and Mfr 
possessed 6.0±1.2% and 12.1±2.5% [6]-gingerol content respectively (Figure 4).

Conclusion 
Methanol soluble fraction (Mfr) of DG extract contained highest quantities polyphenols and 
exhibited higher RSA, antioxidant activities compared to aqueous fraction. Hence, Mfr 
could be used as natural antioxidant, a possible substitution of synthetic antioxidants in 
foods as well as pharmaceutical formulations.
