Introduction
Cordia trichotoma Vell. (Boraginaceae) is a tropical tree,
popularly known as “frei jorge”1. According to a literature
survey, several uses in traditional medicine such as cicatrizant,
astringent, anti-inflammatory, antihelminthic, antimalarial,
diuretic and to treat urinary infections, lung diseases and
leprosy have been reported for several Cordia species2-4. No
medicinal use has been reported for C. trichotoma, but its
wood is recognized for its durability in carpentry and
construction1. Previous phytochemical investigations of plants
from this genus have described several natural products
structurally related to terpenoid quinone and hydroquino-nes5-
7
. In the last few years, several articles have been published
on this kind of compounds, from Auxemma genus8-10,
belonging to the same family and formerly considered
synonimous of Cordia. To the best of our knowledge, except
for a publication in which the presence of eudesmol isomers
from C. trichotoma wood11 has been recorded, there have
been no other reports of any similar chemical investigation in
the literature. In this paper we describe the isolation and
structure elucidation of the known compounds: β-sitosterol,
sitosterol-β-D-glucoside12, oleanolic acid13, allantoin14,
sucrose15, α-cadinol16, oncocalyxone A8, cordiachrome C5,
and a new sesquiterpene, trichotomol (1). Although
cordiachrome C (2) had been previously isolated from C.
millenii, only the partial 1H NMR data was provided but some
doubt about its stereochemistry5 has remained. Here the
complete 1H and 13C spectral data and assignments for 2 are
reported for the first time and used to corroborate the
stereochemical aspects.
Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was obtained as colorless crystals, mp
159-160 °C and [α]589= –17.1 (c 0.7, CHCl3, 23 °C). Its IR
spectrum revealed hydroxyl (3353 cm-1 and 1116 cm-1) and
olefinic (1657 cm-1) absorptions.
The molecular formula C15H26O2, which indicates three
double-bond equivalents, was deduced using EIMS,
13C NMR, and DEPT analyses. The 13C NMR (BB and
DEPT) spectra displayed signals corresponding to four
methyl, four methylene, four methine, and three non-
hydrogenated carbons. Resonances due to two olefinic
carbons at δC 134.3 (C) and 124.7 (CH) in the 13C NMR
spectrum accounted for one double-bond equivalent,e-mail: otilia@dqoi.ufc.br
788 Menezes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
suggesting that 1 as a bicyclic compound. Two of the non-
hydrogenated saturated carbons, δC 74.2 and 72.1, were
shifted to high frequency indicating they were attached to
oxygen atoms. The EIMS spectrum did not present the
molecular ion, but showed ions at m/z 220 (M - H2O) and
202 (M - 2H2O), in agreement with the presence of two
hydroxyl groups for 1. The 1H NMR spectrum indicated
resonances corresponding to four methyl groups, three of
which were attached to carbons bearing hydroxyl groups: δH
1.09 (s), 1.19 (s) and 1.20 (s), while the third one (δH 1.64, s)
due to the high frequency chemical shift seemed to be attached
to a double bond. The presence of just one olefinic hydrogen
δH 6.14 (br s), suggested the presence of a trisubstituted double
bond which is in accordance with 13C NMR data.
DEPT, and EIMS (m/z 242, [M]+). The IR spectrum of 2
showed the presence of carbonyl (1680 cm-1) and olefinic
(1656 cm-1) groups.
Comparative analysis of BB and DEPT – 13C NMR
spectra revealed six sp3 carbons (two methyls, two
methylenes, one methine and one quaternary), two carbonyl
groups and eight sp2 carbons (three non-hydrogenated, three
methines and two methylenes).The presence of a 1,4-
benzoquinone moiety was revealed by the chemical shifts
for H-2 δH (6.70, d, J 9.2 Hz) and H-3 δH (6.68, d, J 9.2 Hz),
and for the carbons atoms C-1 (δC 187.1) and C-4 (δC 186.9).
The 500 MHz 1H NMR spectrum presented information
for all signals, including the homoallylic coupling of the
methylene groups 2H-5 [δH 2.66 (H-5α), 2.24 (H-5β)],
and 2H-8 [δH 2.60 (H-8β), 2.44 (H-8α)]. The signal at δH
2.18 (dd, J 11.1 and 5.0 Hz) was attributed to H-10a, whose
coupling constant values correspond to vicinal spin-spin
interaction between hydrogens H-10 and H-10a.
1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (DEPT and HMQC) also
showed signals related to the methylene of a vinyl group –
CH=CH2 δH [5.87 (dd, J 10.9 and 17.5 Hz, H-14), 4.98
(d, J 10.9 Hz, H-15a), 4.87 (d, J 17.7 Hz, H-15b)] and the
methylene of an isopropenyl group –C(CH3)=CH2 δH [4.88
(s, H-12a), 4.74 (s, H-12b), 1.73 (s, 3H-13)]. The
heteronuclear long-range interaction between the methyl
carbon CH3-13 [δC 23.2; δH 1.73 (s)] and hydrogens 2H-12
δH [4.88 (s) and 4.74 (s)] and H-7 (δH 2.18, dd, J 11.1 and
5.0 Hz) observed in the HMBC spectrum, was also used to
locate that methyl at carbon C-5 (δC 145.1).
The cis relative configuration for the double bond
moieties was supported from the chemical shift at δ
 
1.11
corresponding to the angular methyl (CH3-16)5. The
proposed stereochemistry was also supported by the
NOESY experiment (Figure 2), that showed correlation
between H-5β, 3H-16 and H-7. Thus, 2 was identified as
6-ethenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-methyl-7-(1-methyl-
ethenyl)-1,4-naphthalenedione.

These data were similar to those reported for
α-cadinol16. Except for the observed differences, especially
for the carbon atoms at δC 53.0 (C-7), 74.2 (C-11), 24.1
(C-12) and 32.1 (C-13), of 1 in respect to those of α-cadinol,
what could be explained by the existence of an additional
C-11 hydroxyl group in 1. The slight difference between
the chemical shift of methyls C-12 and C-13
(δC 24.1 and 32.1, respectively) revealed that there is no
free rotation around the single bond C7-C11, as expected.
From the NOESY data it was possible to assign
unambiguously the chemical shift of both carbons through
the dipolar interaction of H-6 (δH 1.93) with the slightly
more protected H-12 (δH 1.19) and the equatorial H-8 (δH
1.75) with the other one H-13 (δH 1.20). HMQC data it
was easy to assign both carbon chemical shifts.
The relative stereochemistry of 1 was determined by
analysis of the NOESY spectrum. The observed nOes for
H-1α, H-2α, H-9α and H-7α; for H-6β, H-2β and 3H-14β
were consistent with a trans configuration of the A/B rings.
These data also suggested that the configurations of HO-
10 and HO(CH3)2C-7 groups were α and β, respectively
(Figure 1). Based on these data, the structure of 1 was
determined as the 10α,11-dihydroxy-4-cadinene, which is
a new sesquiterpene.
Compound 2 was obtained as an orange oil, and its
molecular formula, C16H18O2, was suggested by 13C NMR,

Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were determined using a melting point
apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained on
a Perkin-Elmer 1000 FT-IR instrument. EIMS data were
obtained using a VG-Auto Spec mass spectrometer. Optical
rotations were measured in a Perkin-Elmer 341 digital
polarimeter. The NMR spectra were recorded in a Bruker
DRX 500 [500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C)] spectrometer.
Chemical shifts were recorded in δ (ppm) from TMS relative
to the solvent absorption relative to TMS, CDCl3 δ (7.24
and 77.0 ppm), and DMSO-d6 (2.49 and 39.5 ppm). Column
chromatography (CC) was performed using silica gel 60
(Merck). TLC analysis were performed on precoated silica
gel UV254 plates (Aldrich). Visualization of TLC plates was
performed using a mixture of vanillin-perchloric acid-EtOH
as a spray reagent. Spots were visualized by spraying the plates
and then heating them at 100 °C for 1-3 min in a oven.
Plant material
Cordia trichotoma was collected in March 1998, at the
Meruoca mountain, State of Ceará, Brazil, and identified
by A. S. Nogueira de Castro and E. P. Nunes, botanists of
the Universidade Federal do Ceará, where a voucher
specimen is deposited (Herbarium Prisco Bezerra, No.
25.165).
Extraction and Isolation
The air-dried and pulverized heartwood (2.0 kg) was
exhaustively extracted with EtOH at room temperature and
then concentrated under vacuum to yield 124.0 g of a brown
residue. The ethanol extract was first fractioned by CC with
hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH. The hexane fraction
was subjected to CC and eluted with mixtures of hexane
and EtOAc of increasing polarities to give β-sitosterol
(176.0 mg, mp 162-164 °C), oleanolic acid (25.0 mg, mp
>300 °C), α-cadinol (58.0 mg, mp 73-74 °C) and the new
compound 1 (186.0 mg, mp 158-160 °C). Similarly, CC of
the CHCl3 fraction, eluting with an hexane-EtOAc gradient,
yielded oncocalyxone A (73.0 mg, mp 208-209 °C) and
cordiachrome C (2, 32.6 mg). The EtOAc fraction gave β-
sitosterol-β-D-glucoside (287.0 mg, mp 289-292 °C), after
repeated CC, using EtOAc-MeOH as eluent. From the
MeOH fraction a precipitate was collected and was
identified as sucrose (2.96 g, mp 185-186 °C). The residue
from the supernanant MeOH fraction, after evaporation,
was submitted to CC. Elution with increasing polarity with
CHCl3/EtOAc gave allantoin (630.0 mg, mp 230-232 °C).
