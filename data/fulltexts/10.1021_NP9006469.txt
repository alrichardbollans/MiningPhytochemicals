Their structureswere elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Some of the new isolates exhibit significant cytotoxicities whentested against a small panel of tumor cell lines.The plants of the Chloranthaceae family are rich sources ofsesquiterpenoid oligomers, which have attracted considerableinterest due to the diverse structures and significant biologicalactivities, such as antifungal,1 cytotoxicity,2 and inhibition of celladhesion expression.3 In our recent study, a number of dimericsesquiterpenoids isolated from Chloranthus spicatus were foundto exhibit potent and selective inhibition of the delayed rectifier(IK) K+ current.4,5 There are three species in the Sarcandra genusof the Chloranthaceae family, which are mainly distributed in thesoutheast of Asia. The plant Sarcandra glabra (Thunb.) Nakai, anevergreen shrub growing in southern China, has been applied inthe system of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treatinflammation, bone fracture, and cancer.6,7 Previous chemicalinvestigations of this species have led to the isolation of hepato-protective sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoid glycosides.8 In thisstudy, two new sesquiterpenes, sarcandralactones A (1) and B (2),and five new dimeric sesquiterpenoids, sarcandrolides A-E (3-7),along with 10 known compounds were isolated from the wholeplants of S. glabra. We present herein the isolation, structuralelucidation, and cytotoxic evaluation of these new isolates.Results and DiscussionThe HREIMS of sarcandralactone A (1) displayed a molecularion at m/z 246.1241 [M]+, consistent with the molecular formulaof C15H18O3 requiring seven degrees of unsaturation. The IRspectrum indicated the presence of hydroxy (3439 cm-1) andcarbonyl (1720 cm-1) groups. Its 1H NMR spectrum displayed acharacteristic upfield shifted resonance at δH 0.69 diagnostic forthe cyclopropane ring of lindenane sesquiterpenoids,9-11 two methylsinglets, and two resonances at δH 5.08 (s) and 4.97 (s) for a terminaldouble bond (Table 1). All 15 carbons were resolved in the 13CNMR spectrum and were categorized by DEPT experiments as twomethyl, four methylene (one olefinic), three methine (one oxygen-ated), and six quaternary carbons (one oxygenated, three olefinic,and one ester carbonyl) (Table 1). These functionalities accountedfor three out of the seven degrees of unsaturation, and the remainingfour degrees of unsaturation implied compound 1 to be tetracyclic.The 1H and 13C NMR data of 1 were similar to those ofheterogorgiolide,9 indicating a lindena-4(15)-en-12,8-olide structuralmoiety for 1, which was confirmed by the HMBC spectrum. Inthis experiment, the key correlations from the two protons of theexocyclic double bond [δH 5.08 (s) and 4.97 (s)], the protons ofCH2-6 [δH 3.18 (d, J ) 15.0 Hz) and 2.42 (d, J ) 15.0 Hz)], andthe angular methyl at δH 1.30 (s, 3H) to the same oxygenatedquaternary carbon at δC 80.3 placed the hydroxy group at C-5(Figure 1a).The relative configuration of 1 was established on the basis of aROESY spectrum (Figure 1b), in which correlations of H3-14/H-2 and H3-14/H-8 revealed that H3-14, H-8, and the cyclopropanering were cofacial and were arbitrarily assigned a -orientation.Consequently, H-1 and H-3 were assigned as R-oriented. Theconfiguration of the C-5 stereocenter could not be assigned by theROESY spectrum since no correlation could be detected. To assignthe relative configuration of C-5, the pyridine-induced solvent shiftmethod was applied.12 The 1H NMR data of 1 measured in CDCl3and pyridine-d5 showed significant pyridine-induced solvent shifts[∆δ is defined as δ(CDCl3) - δ(pyridine-d5)] for H-2 (∆δ )-0.52), H3-14 (∆δ ) -0.15), H-6R (∆δ ) -0.21), and H-6 (∆δ) -0.22), indicating that the 5-OH was -oriented. Therefore, thestructure of 1 was elucidated as depicted.Sarcandralactone B (2), a colorless solid, showed a molecularformula of C15H20O3 ([M]+ m/z 248.1411) with six degrees of* Corresponding author.

The IR spectrum showed absorptionbands for the presence of hydroxy and carbonyl groups. The 13CNMR spectrum displayed 15 carbon signals comprising threemethyl, three methylene, three sp3 methine (two oxygenated), onesp3 quaternary carbon, one ester carbonyl at δC 174.8, and fourolefinic carbons (Table 1). Its 1H NMR spectrum showed threemethyl singlets at δH 0.95, 1.70, and 1.84, two oxymethines at δH3.56 (dd, J ) 9.6, 6.3 Hz) and 4.90 (dd, J ) 12.1, 6.8 Hz), andone olefinic proton at δH 5.38 (br s) (Table 1). The abovespectroscopic analysis indicated that 2 is likely a eudesmadien-12,8-olide. In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 2a), the correlationsfrom the upfield methyl singlet (δH 0.95) to C-1 (δC 74.9), C-5,C-9, and C-10 placed the hydroxy group at C-1; the correlationsfrom H3-15 (δH 1.70) to C-3 (δC 121.1), C-4(δC 132.9), and C-5indicated the ∆3 double bond; and the correlations from H-8 toC-7, C-9, and C-11 as well as the correlations from H3-13 to C-7,C-11, and C-12 confirmed the presence of a γ-lactone moietybetween C-12 and C-8. In the ROESY spectrum of 2 (Figure 2b),the correlations of H-1/H-5, H-5/H-6R, and H-1/H-9R indicatedthat they were cofacial and were arbitrarily assigned as R-oriented.Consequently, the ROESY correlations of H3-14/H-8, H3-14/H-6,and H-8/H-6 indicated that they were -oriented. Compound 2was thus assigned as 1-hydroxy-3,7(11)-eudesmadien-12,8-olide.Sarcandrolide A (3) was isolated as a colorless solid. TheHREIMS gave a molecular ion at m/z 618.2827 corresponding tothe molecular formula C36H42O9. The IR absorptions revealed thepresence of carbonyl and hydroxy functionalities. In accord withthe molecular formula, 36 carbon resonances were well resolvedin the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 3) and were categorized by DEPTexperiments as four carbonyl (δC 200.4, 173.4, 170.7, and 168.3),eight olefinic carbons (three persubstituted and one trisubstituteddouble bond), seven methyl (one O-methyl), five sp3 methylene(one oxygenated), eight sp3 methine (one oxygenated), and foursp3 quaternary carbons (two oxygenated). Its 1H NMR spectrumshowed two strongly upfield shifted resonances at δH 0.28 and 0.70being interpreted in terms of cyclopropane rings (Table 2). TheNMR data of 3 showed close resemblance to those of shizukaolC13 except for the significant changes of C-13′ and H-13′, whichindicated the presence of a C-13′ methyl group in 3 instead of anoxygenated methylene in shizukaol C.13 This was confirmed bythe HMBC correlations from H3-13′ to C-7′, C-11′, and C-12′.Analysis of the HMBC spectrum finalized the planar structure of 3(Figure 3a). The relative configuration of 3 was established by aROESY experiment (Figure 3b). The ROESY correlations of H-1/H-3, H-1/H-2R, H-1/H-9, H-5′/H-9, H-3′/H2-15′, and H-5′/H2-15′indicated that they were cofacial and were arbitrarily assigned asR-oriented. As a consequence, the ROESY correlations of H3-14/H-2, H3-14/H-6, H-6/H-9′, and H-9′/H3-14′ revealed that they were-oriented. Thus, compound 3 was determined as 13′-deoxyshi-zukaol C.The HRESIMS of sarcandrolide B (4) displayed a sodiatedmolecular ion peak at m/z 673.2632 [M + Na]+, consistent withthe molecular formula C36H42O11. Its 13C NMR spectrum showedsimilarities to that of shizukaol C,13 except for the absence of oneolefinic methyl group and the presence of one additional oxygenatedmethylene in 4 (Table 3). Comparing the 1H NMR data of 4 withthat of shizukaol C,13 the olefinic proton H-3′′ resonated as a broadtriplet at δH 6.90 (br t, J ) 6.0 Hz) in 4 (Table 2), while it was adouble quartet at δH 6.88 (qq, J ) 7.1, 1.0 Hz) in shizukaol C,13suggesting that C-4′′ of 4 was an oxygenated methylene. TheHMBC correlations from H2-4′′ at δH 4.26 (dd, J ) 15.0, 4.9 Hz)and δH 4.44 (dd, J ) 15.0, 7.0 Hz) to C-2′′ and C-3′′ confirmedthis speculation. The relative configuration of 4 was fixed by theROESY spectrum, which resulted in the same assignment asshizukaol C in the dimeric core.Sarcandrolide C (5) was assigned the molecular formulaC42H46O15 on the basis of HRESIMS (m/z 813.2715 [M + Na]+).The 1H NMR data exhibited the characteristic upfield shiftedresonances (δH 0.34 and 0.71) of cyclopropane rings (Table 2),indicating that compound 5 is also likely a lindenane-type sesquit-Table 1. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR Data (100 MHz) of 1 and 21 2no. δH mult (J in Hz)a δH mult (J in Hz)b δCa δH mult (J in Hz)a δCa1 1.45 m 1.34 ddd (8.1, 6.0, 4.3) 31.7 3.56 dd (9.6, 6.3) 74.92 0.69 dt (4.5, 8.1), 1.53 m 0.65 dt (4.1, 8.4), 2.05 m 13.9 2.02 m, 2.34 m 32.33 1.84 m 1.84 ddd (8.8, 6.1, 3.3) 20.9 5.38 br s 121.14 153.8 132.95 80.3 1.99 m 47.36 3.18 d (15.0) 3.40 d (14.5) 32.8 2.20 t (13.8) 25.32.42 d (15.0) 2.63 d (14.5) 2.91 dd (13.8, 3.8)7 159.1 162.98 4.69 dd (12.5, 5.3) 4.81 dd (12.5, 5.7) 77.2 4.90 dd (12.1, 6.8) 78.49 2.34 dd (5.3, 12.5) 2.32 dd (12.5, 5.7) 45.1 0.98 t (12.1) 42.01.15 t (12.5) 1.16 t (12.5) 2.74 dd (12.1, 6.8)10 45.4 38.911 120.0 120.612 174.9 174.813 1.79 s, 3H 1.80 s, 3H 8.3 1.84 s, 3H 8.314 1.30 s, 3H 1.45 s, 3H 17.2 0.95 s, 3H 10.015 5.08 s, 4.97 s 5.05 s, 5.02 s 106.4 1.70 s, 3H 20.8a Measured in CDCl3. b Measured in pyridine-d5.Figure 1.

The 13C NMR data of 5 showed similarity to thoseof shizukaol G,14 except for the presence of two additional signals(δC 169.9 and 20.7) being assignable to the presence of an acetylgroup in 5 (Table 3). The O-acetyl group was located at C-2′′′ bythe HMBC correlation between H-2′′′ (δH 5.48, dd, J ) 4.8, 3.3Hz) and the carbonyl carbon (δC 169.9) of the acetyl group. Thussarcandrolide C (5) was determined as 2′′′-O-acetylshizukaol G.The HREIMS of sarcandrolide D (6) exhibited a molecular ionpeak at m/z 678.2666 [M]+, corresponding to the molecular formulaC37H42O12. The 1H NMR spectrum showed characteristic protonresonances for cyclopropane rings and six methyl groups, whichwere classified according to the chemical shifts as two angular (δH0.81 and 0.96), three olefinic [δH 1.53 (s), 1.78 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz),and 1.78 (s)], and one acetyl methyl [δH 2.03 (s)] (Table 2). The13C NMR spectrum displayed 37 carbon resonances comprising sixmethyl, six methylene (two oxygenated), seven sp3 methine (oneoxygenated), eight olefinic (three tetrasubstituted and one trisub-stituted double bonds), four ester carbonyl, and six sp3 quaternarycarbons (three oxygenated and one hemiacetal at δC 103.4) (Table3). Comparison of its 13C NMR data with those of 3-5 showedseveral changes in the dimeric core, suggesting that this part of thestructure of 6 is different from those of 3-5. Comparison of its13C NMR data with those of chlorahololide F5 showed that the twocompounds were structurally close, except for the presence of oneoxygenated methine (C-9) in 6 instead of the keto carbonyl C-9 inchlorahololide F. The HMBC correlations from H3-14 (δH 0.81,3H) to C-1, C-5, C-9 (δC 78.3), and C-10 revealed that a hydroxygroup was located at C-9 of 6, replacing the C-9 keto group ofchlorahololide F. The planar structure of 6 was further verified bythe HMBC spectrum (Figure 4a). Its relative configuration wasassigned by a ROESY spectrum (Figure 4b), in which the OH-9was fixed as -oriented by the ROESY cross-peak between H-9and H-1. The relative configuration of the remaining stereocentersof 6 was determined to be the same as chlorahololide F by theirsimilar NMR data and the ROESY spectrum.Sarcandrolide E (7) had the molecular formula C38H44O12, asdetermined by HREIMS at m/z 692.2805 [M]+. Its 1H and 13C NMRspectra showed close resemblance to those of 6, indicating that theyare structurally related analogues. The NMR data of 7 comparedwith 6 revealed the presence of one keto carbonyl (δC 198.9) andone O-methyl group and the absence of the hemiacetal moiety,suggesting that compound 7 was likely produced by the metha-nolysis of the 8,12-lactone ring of 6. This speculation was confirmedby the HMBC correlations from H-9 to C-10 and C-8 (δC 198.9)and between OCH3 (δH 3.76) and C-12 (δC 169.6). The relativeconfiguration of 7 was established to be the same as 6 by theROESY spectrum.The absolute configurations of 3-7 were determined by applyingthe CD exciton chirality method.15 All five sesquiterpenoid dimersshowed a similar CD split pattern in the 210-260 nm region, wherepositive chirality arose from the exciton coupling of the R,-unsaturated γ-lactone (C-7′, C-11′, and C-12′) and twisted π-elec-tron system [(C-5-C-8 and C-11-C-12) or (C-7-C-8 and C-11-C-12)] chromophores (Figure 5). The CD spectra of 3-7 also matchedvery well with those of reported sesquiterpenoid dimers,5 supportingthese assignments. The absolute configuration of 3-7 was thereforeassigned as depicted.Ten known compounds were identified on the basis of their 1Hand 13C NMR and ESIMS data as (+)-spathulenol,16 chlorantha-lactone E,17 neolitacumone B,18 3-eudesmene-1,7,11-triol,19 chlo-rahololide F,5 shizukaol B,13 shizukaol C,13 shizukaol E,14 shizukaolG,14 and cycloshizukaol A.20The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1-7 were evaluatedagainst the HL-60 (human leukemia) cell line by using the MTTmethod21 and against the A-549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) andBEL-7402 (human hepatocarcinoma) cell lines by using the SRBmethod,22 and with pseudolaric acid B23 as the positive control(IC50 ) 4.2 µM against HL-60, 1.6 µM against A-549, and 1.3 µMagainst BEL-7402). The results revealed that compounds 3-5showed inhibitory activities against the HL-60 cell line with IC50values of 3.1, 8.4, and 8.5 µM, respectively, compounds 3 and 5showed inhibitory activities against the A-549 cell line with IC50values of 7.2 and 4.7 µM, respectively, while none of the testedcompounds showed inhibitory activity on the BEL-7402 cell line.Table 2. 1H NMR Data (CDCl3, 400 MHz) of 3-7δH mult (J in Hz)no. 3 4 5 6 71 2.06 m 2.07 m 2.05 ddd (8.2, 5.7, 4.3) 1.85 m 1.96 m2 0.28 m, 0.98 m 0.33 m, 0.99 m 0.34 m, 1.00 m 0.88 m, 1.08 m 0.94 m, 2H3 1.83 m 1.86 m 1.84 m 1.78 m 1.82 m6 3.88 d (3.0) 3.91 br s 3.93 d, (3.8)9 3.95 s 3.91 s 3.85 s 3.86 s 3.72 s13 1.82 s, 3H 1.91 s, 3H 1.89 s, 3H 1.53 s, 3H 1.73 s, 3H14 1.00 s, 3H 1.01 s, 3H 1.01 s, 3H 0.81 s, 3H 1.04 s, 3H15 2.57 d (16.8) 2.56 dd (16.6, 1.8) 2.56 ddd (16.5, 6.0, 3.8) 1.74 m 1.69 dd (13.5, 10.6)2.74 d (16.8) 2.82 dd (16.6, 0.9) 2.77 dd (16.5, 5.0) 2.71 m 2.73 dd (13.6, 6.8)1′ 1.54 m 1.64 m 1.61 m 1.55 m 1.54 m2′ 0.70 m, 1.23 m 0.72 m, 1.31 (m) 0.71 m, 1.32 m 0.61 m, 1.16 m 0.60 m, 1.19 m3′ 1.51 m 1.43 m 1.39 m 1.68 m 1.58 m5′ 1.74 dd (14.2, 6.2) 1.90 m 1.90 m 2.16 m 1.54 m6′ 2.22 dd (18.0, 6.2) 2.40 dd (18.6, 6.3) 2.31 dd (19.2, 6.2) 2.44 dd (17.6, 6.8) 2.30 dd (18.0, 6.4)2.50 dd (18.0, 14.2) 2.82 dd (18.6, 13.6) 2.91 dd (19.2, 13.8) 2.85 m 2.88 dd (18.0, 13.5)9′ 1.80 m 1.94 m 1.88 m 2.63 m 2.55 dd (10.4, 7.5)13′ 1.80 s, 3H 4.34 d (15.3) 4.44 d (12.0) 4.76 d (12.8) 4.82 s, 2H4.41 d (15.3) 5.39 d (12.0) 4.82 d (12.8)14′ 0.83 s, 3H 0.87 s, 3H 0.79 s, 3H 0.96 s, 3H 0.94 s, 3H15′ 3.85 d (11.9) 3.80 d (11.6) 3.67 d (12.0) 4.03 d (11.1) 3.85 d (11.3)4.15 d (11.9) 4.38 d (11.6) 4.55 d (12.0) 4.07 d (11.1) 4.15 d (11.3)3′′ 6.90 br q (6.6) 6.77 br t (6.0) 6.56 br t (6.0) 6.84 br q (7.0) 6.84 br q (7.0)4′′ 1.85 d (6.6) 3H 4.26 dd (15.0, 4.9) 4.61 dd (14.0, 6.4) 1.78 d (7.0) 1.83 d (7.0)4.44 dd (15.0, 7.0) 5.36 dd (14.0, 5.9)5′′ 1.83 s, 3H 1.87 s, 3H 1.95 d (0.9) 1.78 s, 3H 1.84 s, 3H2′′′ 5.48 dd (4.8, 3.3)3′′′ 2.77 dd (14.3, 4.8)3.49 dd (14.3, 3.3)OMe 3.77 s, 3H 3.74 s, 3H 3.71 s, 3H 3.76 s, 3HOAc 2.17 s, 3H 2.03 s, 3H 2.07 s, 3HSesquiterpenes from Sarcandra glabra Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 1 47Experimental SectionGeneral Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measuredon a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. UV spectra were obtained on aShimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on aPerkin-Elmer 577 spectrometer with KBr discs. NMR spectra wererecorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer. EIMS (70 eV) andHREIMS were measured on a Finnigan MAT-95 mass spectrometerin m/z (rel %), and ESIMS and HRESIMS were obtained on an Esquire3000 plus (Bruker Daltonics) and a Waters-Micromass Q-TOF UltimaGlobal electrospray mass spectrometer, respectively. All solvents usedwere of analytical grade (Shanghai Chemical Plant, Shanghai, People′sRepublic of China). Silica gel (200-300 mesh), silica gel H60,Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Biosciences), reversed-phase C18 silicagel (150-200 mesh, Merck), and MCI gel (CHP20P, 75-150 µm,Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd.) were used for column chroma-tography. Precoated silica gel GF254 plates (Qingdao Haiyang ChemicalCo. Ltd. Qingdao, People′s Republic of China) were used for TLC.Plant Material. The whole plants of Sarcandra glabra werecollected in June of 2005 from Hainan Province, P. R. China. The plantwas authenticated by Prof. S. M. Huang, Department of Biology, HainanUniversity of China. A voucher specimen has been deposited inShanghai Institute of Materia Medica, SIBS, Chinese Academy ofSciences (access number: SGWP-2005-1Y).Extraction and Isolation. The air-dried powder of the plant material(4 kg) was percolated with 95% EtOH (3 × 5 L) to give 400 g ofcrude extract, which was dissolved in water (1 L) and partitionedsuccessively with petroleum ether and EtOAc. The EtOAc-solublefraction (90 g) was subjected to an MCI gel column (MeOH/H2O, 0%to 100%) to give three fractions, 1-3. Fraction 1 (50 g) was separatedon a silica gel column (petroleum ether/acetone, 50:1 to 0:1) to affordseven fractions, 1a-1g. Fraction 1b was chromatographed over a silicagel column, eluted with petroleum ether/EtOAc, 20:1, to afford fourfractions, 1b1-1b4. Fraction 1b1 (150 mg) was purified on a SephadexLH-20 column, eluted with EtOH, to give (+)-spathulenol (80 mg);fraction 1b3 (220 mg) gave neolitacumone B (70 mg) by the samepurification procedure.
