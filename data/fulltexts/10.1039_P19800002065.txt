A eudesmane-type sesquiterpene acid with an aromatic A-ring isolated from a Guyanan tree Dulacia guianensis 
(Olacacea) was assigned a structure and an absolute stereochemistry (1) on the basis of spectroscopic evidence and 
partial synthesis. The isolate had moderate antileukaemic activity in P-388 lymphocytic leukaemia. 
A EuDEsMANE-nPE sesquiterpene acid with an aromatic 
A-ring (1) for which the name manicol is suggested was 
isolated from the root bark of a Guyanan tree Dzclucia 
guiaizensis (End.) O. Ktze (Olacaceae) (known locally as 
' Balata kamwi ' and The tree is un- 
common, and tlie sample obtained was from a tree sited

in the forest a t  Gallion at a location 20 km froin tlie sea, 
south of Cayenne.? 
Among the eudesmane sesquiterpenes which have been 
isolated containing an aromatic A-ring are rishitinol (2), 
a stress metabolite from the potato 1 and occidol(3) from 
Thuja occidentalis.2 
The new sesquiterpene (l), which crystallised asneedles, 
was optically active, [o(lD $90.6" (c, 0.94, CHC1,). A 
high-resolution mass spectrum and elemental analysis of 
the compound gave the molecular formula as C,,H,,O,. 
Bands in the i.r. spectrum of the sesquiterpene (1) were 
present in the hydroxy (3 300 cm-l) (in KBr) and car- 
bonyl (1 646 cm-l) (in CHCI,) stretching regions. The 
1H n.m.r. spectrum had signals due to a single aromatic 
proton (6 7.38), two vinyl protons (6 4.75), an aromatic 
methyl group (6 2.38), one vinyl methyl group (6 1.78), 
and a resonance at  6 8.2 which was assigned to a hydroxy- 
group. This last signal exchanged on deuteriation and 
was not present in the lH n.m.r. spectrum of the methyl- 
ated product. Also present in the lH n.m.r. spectrum of 
t The material studied was collected in February 1976 by one 
of us (H. J.) and a sample (No. H J 2165) deposited in the Herbier 
du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. 
(1) was a resonance 6 1.6-3.4 due to seven aliphatic 
protons. 
The product from the methylation (MeI-K,CO,) of (1) 
hac2 a lH n.m.r. spectrum which showed signals in the 
region of an aromatic methyl ether (6 3.05) and an aro- 
matic methyl ester (6 3.88). The assignment of the latter 
signal was supported by the i.r. spectrum which con- 
tained an absorption band at 1700 cm-1. The mass 
spectrum of the methylated product confirmed that two 
additional methyl groups were present. 
The carboxylic acid group and phenolic group are 
ortho to each other as seen from the chelating effect in 
the i.r. spectrum and the green colouration with ethanolic 
ferric chloride. 
Inspection of the 13C n.m.r. spectrum of manicol re- 
vealed a substantial amount of structural information 
from which it was ascertained that the ncw compound 
has a sesquiterpene structure containing an aromatic n- 
ring with the isopropylene group located at position 7. 
The off-resonance decoupled 13C n.m.r. spectrum 
showed the presence of the following: 2 CH,, 3 CH,, 1 CH, 
I CH,=, 1 CH=, 6 sp2 fully substituted carbons, and 1 CO 
group; it also accounted for 16 protons. The two re- 
maining protons were observed as D,O-exchangeable 
protons in the 1H n.m.r. spectrum. The carbon reson- 
ances were assigned (see Table) by comparison with the 
rcsonance positions of a variety of known compounds of 
similar structure.

* See formula (1) for numbering of eudesmane-type ses- 
quiterpenes. Signals may be reversed. 
Aromatic sesquiterpenes of this nature and also 
aromatic steroids, triterpenes, and sapogenins arise 
biosynthetically by a dienone-phenol type rearrange- 
ment,, consequently structures (1) or (4) would be 
acceptable for the compound. 
The 1H n.m.r. spectrum of compound (1) was not use- 
ful in differentiating between the two proposed struc- 
tures (1) and (a), since the signals for the aromatic 
protons at  position 3 in structure (4) and position 2 in 
structure (I), when calculated, occur at the same position 
2066 
as the observed signal in the natural product (6 7.38). 
The breakdown pattern in the mass spectrum supports 
either structure for the sesquiterpene.

and to establish the absolute stereochemistry, an authen- 
tic synthesis was undertaken. The methyl ether (5) was 
synthesised from the keto1 (6), [a], +51" (G 0.95, CHCI,).

The reagent plienylseleninic anhydride was more favour- 
ed, since the reaction )time was much shorter (20 min) 
and the yield better (89%). Treatment of the dienone 
(9) with HC1 yielded the phenol (10) in a typical dienone- 
phenol rearrangement. The ketone stretch of the 
dienone was absent in the i r .  spectrum of the product 
whereas a phenol OH stretch was present a t  3 450 cm-l. 
The 1H n.m.r. spectrum of the product showed a signal 
for a single aromatic proton at  6 6.55 corresponding to the 
proton a t  position 2. Also, signals for two aromatic 
methyl groups were present a t  6 2.18 and 2.15. 
The phenolic acetate was also prepared by treatment of 
the dienone (9) with toluene-p-sulphonic acid and 
acetic anhydride. This acetate was found to be identical 
with the acetate prepared from the phenol (10). Methyl-

The latter compound was originally obtained from (+)- 
dihydrocarvone, the absolute stereochemistry of which 
is known? The synthetic methyl ether (5) was com- 
pared with that obtained from methylation and reduction 
of the natural compound (1). Also, by comparison of the 
specific rotation of both samples, the absolute stereo- 
chemistry should be established for the new sesquiter- 
pene. The synthetic scheme followed is outlined (see 
Scheme). 
Dehydrogenation of the enone (8) with DDQ in 
dioxan or with phenylseleninic anhydride in chloro- 
benzene@ yielded the dienone (9), which was easily 
identified from its lH n.m.r. spectrum showing doublets 
at 6 6.33 and 6 6.87 for the protons at positions 1 and 2. 
ation of the phenol (10) with methyl iodide yielded the 
required methyl ether (5). It is of interest that hydro- 
genation of the isopropylene double bond is necessary 
at  an early stage in the reaction scheme, because if the 
dienone-phenol rearrangement is carried out on the 
dienone (ll), addition of HCl occurs to yield the phenol 
The natural product (1) when treated with hydrogen 
and Pd-C yielded not the expected acid (13) but the 
reduced product (14). This probably arises from the 
existence of an equilibrium between the phenol (1) and a 
dienone which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. 
The natural product (1) was methylated and afforded 
the methyl ester (15). Reduction of this ester with

subsequently reduced with lithium aluminium hydride 
to  yield the methyl compound (17). In  the IH n.m.r. 
spectrum of the product, two aromatic methyl signals 
were distinguishable a t  6 2.18 and 2.15. Finally, hydro- 
genation of the side-chain double bond yielded the re- 
quired methyl ether (5) which was identical in every 
respect with the methyl ether synthesised from (+)- 
dihydrocarvone. The specific rotation of the methyl 
ether (5) synthesised from the keto1 (6) was +48.2' and 
the specific rotation of the same methyl ether synthe- 
sised from the natural product was +48.0". Therefore 
the natural product has the structure (1) and a stereo- 
chemistry at  carbon 7 similar to (+)-dihydrocarvone.

mined at room temperature on a Roussel- Jouan Quick 
polarimeter. 1.r. spectra were recorded with a Perkin- 
Elmer model 257 spectrometer for chloroform solutions.

505 spectrometer (Bausch and Lomb) . Electron-impact 
mass spectra were taken on an MS 50-AEI spectrometer.

deuteriochloroform; absorptions are given in 6 units (p.p.m.) 
and coupling constants in Hz. Tetramethylsilane was used 
as internal standard. The 13C n.m.r. spectrum was measured

and then cooled. Water (100 ml) was added to  the niixture 
which was then extracted with chloroform, dried (MgSO,) , 
and the solvent evaporated to  yield an oil. The oil was 
chromatographed (p.1.c. 1 : 1 ether-hexane) to yield epi-a- 
cyperone (43 mg) and the product (11) (17 mg) ; -99.5"

tetralzydronaphthalene (1 2) .-The trienone (1  1) (1 10 nig) and 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (3 ml) were heated a t  reflux 
for 3 h ;  the mixture was then cooled, diluted with water, 
and extracted with ether. The ether estract was dried 
(Na,SO,) and evaporated to yield an oil which was purified 
by p.1.c. (ether-hexane 1 : 1) to  yield the phenolic product 
(77 mg, 70%); 6 (CDCl,) 6.50 (s, 1 H),  2.90-0.60 (in, 7 H),

Jzydvonapktl~ale~~-5-~arboxylic Acid (14) .-The acid 1 I) (300 
mg) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (40 nil) and hydrogenated 
over palladium (10% on C, 100 nig) until uptake of hydrogen 
had ceased. The catalyst was filtered off and the solvent 
evaporated to yield a colourless oil. Chromatography 
(p.l.c., chloroform) yielded the reduced sesquiterpene (14)
