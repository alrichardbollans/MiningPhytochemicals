(1993) 102: 373-378 Two Related Biosynthetic Pathways of Mugineic Acids in Cramineous Plants Jian Feng Ma* and Kyosuke Nomoto Suntory lnstitute for Bioorganic Research, Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka, 61 8, Japan contrast, strategy I1 is characterized by the secretion of femc chelating substances, which have been generically termed “mugineic acids.” To date, only gramineous species have been found to employ this strategy (Romheld and Marschner, 1986; Nomoto et al., 1987). From the ecologcal point of view, strateg 11 has Some advantages for adaptation to calcareous soils Over strategy I because the fomer is able to solubilize sparingly soluble-inorganic iron and is less sensitive to high pH, elevated bicarbonate concentrations, and excessive Ca2+ and Mg2’ COnCentratiOnS that are cO”On features of calcar- eous soik (Romheld and Marschner, 1986). Thus, it may be best to breed plants that respond to iron deficiency by se- creting mugineic acids. For this purpose, an understanding of the biosynthesis of mugneic acids is a prerequisite because neither purification of related enzymes nor subsequent ,-loning of genes encoding synthetic enzymes of mugineic acids can be performed with- out elucidating the biosynthetic pathway. Since the chemical first determined (Takemoto et al., 1978), its biosynthesis has been explored. On feeding four 14C-labeled amino acids and ~-[l-’~C]Met to iron-deficient barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Minorimugi) roots, L-Met has been found to be the most efficient precursor for mugneic acid and 2‘-deoxymu@neic acid ( ~ ~ ~ ~ i  ,t 1988). similar in vibo findings by Shojima et al. (1989, 1990) have been documented. However, exper- imental data on the biosynthesis of other mugineic acids such as avenic acid A and 3-epihydroxymugineic acid, and on their relationship in the biosynthetic pathway, have yet to be published, although speculation has previously been at- tempted (Mori and Nishizawa, 1987; Kawai et al., 1988; Shojima et al., 1989, 1990). In the present study, four mugineic acids were labeled by feeding either ZH-labeled Met or ‘3C-labeled 2’-deoxymu@- neic acid to water-cultured roots of four different species that were subsequently isolated from these plants. From the re- sults of 2 ~ -  and ~ ~ C - N M R  studes, two related biosynthetic pathways were postulated. l h e  biosynthesis of mugineic acids was studied by feeding ’H- or 13C-labeled compounds to water-cultured roots in severa1 gra- mineous plants. l h e  fate of labeled compounds was monitored by using ’H- and ‘3C-nuclear magnetic resonance. On investigating the proton changes during biosynthesis by feeding bL-[3,3,4,4-d& methionine (98.6% ’H), ’H-labeled 2’-deoxymugineic, mugineic, and 3-epihydroxymugineic acids were isolated from root washings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Minori), barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Minorimugi), beer barley (Hordeum vu/gare L. cv AM ~ i j ~  Tochigi), respectively. l h e  *H-nuclear magnetic resonance study indicated that 12 deuteriums were incorporated into the labeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid, suggesting that three molecules of i-[3,3,4,4-d4lmethionine were combined. In comparison, one of the deuteriums at C-2‘ position in the mugineic acid, and one each of the deuteriums at C-2‘ and C-3 positions in the 3-epihydroxymu- gineic acid, were lost. However, all other deuteriums were incor- porated in a manner similar to that of the labeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid. When [1,4’,4”-13C3]2’-deoxymugineic acid (20% 13C) was fed to oat roots (Avena sativa L. cv Amuri ll), avenic acid A, which was results revealed that L-methionine was the precursor for aII these mugineic acids and that cleavage of the azetidine ring or hydrox- ylation of the 2’-deoxymugineic acid produced two related biosyn- thetic pathways in different gramineous plant species: i-methionine + 2‘-deoxymugineic acid 4 avenic acid A in oat; and i-methionine + 2’-deoxymugineic acid mugineic acid + 3-epihydroxymugi- neic acid in barley and beer barley. ”C enriched at the corresponding positions, was obtained. These structure Of mugineic from barley plants was Low yields due to iron chlorosis is a worldwide agricultura1 concem that is especially acute in cakareous soils. Foliar application Of iron inorganic salts and soil treatment with synthetic chelates are currently accepted practices. However, because iron is not transported from old to new leaves, repeated treatments are required, making this approach costly. Selecting and breeC% Plants resistant to iron deficiencY may be a more economical approach. It is not uncommon to see both chlorotic and green plants growing in the same soil, so it is helpful to understand the mechanisms of iron acqui- sition in these green plants. According to Romheld and Marschner (1986), at least two strategies exist for acquiring iron in higher plants, based on their root responses to iron deficiency. Strategy I, often employed by dicotyledonous and nongrass monocotyledonous species, is characterized by an increase in the reducing capacity of roots, increased net excretion of protons, and enhanced release of reductants. In MATERIALS A N D  METHODS Seeds of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Minori), oat (Avena sativa L. cv Amuri 11), barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Minori- mugi), and beer barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv AM Nijo To&@) were soaked overnight in water before sowing on venniculite in a greenhouse.

Three-tenth strength Hoagland so- lution was supplied to the plants and contained 1.5 m~ KN03, 1.5 mM Ca(N03)*, 0.6 mM MgS04, and 0.3 mM NH4H2P03. Micronutrients were adjusted to full-strength Hoagland solution. The solution was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 0.1 N KOH and renewed every 2 d. Light intensity was about 40 W/m2, and the light/dark periods and temperatures were 14/10 h and 17/10°C, respectively. After a 2-week period, the plants were transferred to iron- free nutrient solution. When chlorosis developed, 200 MM D,L- [3,3,4,4-d4]Met (98.6% 2H, Merck Sharp & Dohme/Isotopes) (actually, only half this concentration; only the L-fonn would be used by the plants) was fed to the roots of wheat, barley, beer barley, and oats after the secretion of mugineic acids. To stimulate the Met uptake, surface-active agent Decaglyn I-L was added at 40 pg mL-' pot-'. Ten micromolar [1,4',4"- '3C3]2'-deoxymugineic acid (20% 13C), obtained by purifica- tion of root washings from wheat fed with 150 PM L-[~- '~C]-  Met (99.0% 13C, Isotec, Inc., Miamisburg, OH), was fed' to the oat roots in a femc complex fonn. To isolate various mugineic acids, root washings were collected the following day by soaking the roots in distilled water from 3 to 5 h after the onset of the light period. The distilled water used for soaking was replaced every hour during the collection to maximize the yield. The root wash- ings were then charged on Amberlite IR-120 (H+) and the cationic fractions of 2 N NHIOH were eluted. Subsequent chromatography on Dowex 50 WX8 was performed, and gradient eluates with ammonia-fonnate buffer (pH 2.5-3.1) provided a concentrated active fraction. Chelating activities were determined by the o-phenanthroline method (Takagi, 1976), and the mugineic acids in different fractions were separated by HPLC (Kawai et al., 1987). Gel filtration through Sephadex G-10 (H20 as a solvent) for concentrated fractions of 2'-deoxymugineic acid, mugineic acid, and 3-epihy- droxymugineic acid was finally conducted. Fractions of av- enic acid A were charged on an AG 50 WX8 column and eluted subsequently by 2 N NH40H.

The 'H-NMR spectra (H20) were measured at 61.3 MHz (JNM-EX400 spectrometer) (Grant et al., 1982). Spectra of 10.0-ps pulse width requiring about 4000 scans were acquired at 2-s intervals with data acquisition (1.28 s) of 4096 points via a nondecoupling experimental mode. The natural abun- dance of *H in H 2 0  was used as a chemical shift reference to the 'H experiment. The assignment was accomplished after analysis of the corresponding proton spectra. 13C-NMR measurements of isolated avenic acid A (in 0.4 N ND40D) were performed with a 75.5-MHz spectrometer (GE-300) (Stothers, 1972). The spectra were obtained using 1-W broadband proton decoupling, 4.0-ps pulse width, 5.0- s delay time, 32,768 data points, and a spectral width of 20,000 Hz. About 10,240 scans were accumulated. Spectra were recorded using 2-Hz line broadening. 3-(Trimethyl- sily1)propionic acid sodium salt-& was used as an extemal reference for calibration of the chemical shift, and assign- ments for 13C were accomplished by 13C-'H correlation spec- troscopy. Calculation of l3C enrichment was based on the line intensity of the C-3 position. RESULTS AND DlSCUSSlON Following the discovery of mugineic acid (Takemoto et al., 1978), severa1 analogs such as hydroxymugineic acid (Nom- oto et al., 1979), avenic acid A (Fushiya et al., 1980), and 3- epihydroxymugineic acid (Iwashita et al., 1981) have been located in different gramineous species. Except for L-Met, which is the precursor of 2'-deoxymugineic acid and mugi- neic acid in barley plants (Mori and Nishizawa, 1987; Kawai et al., 1988; Shojima et al., 1989; Shojima et al., 1990), information on the biosynthesis of mugineic acid analogs is as yet limited. In the present study, biosynthesis routes of different mugineic acids in four species were compared. Both 'H- and 13C-NMR were used for monitoring the fates of labeled compounds. Because 'H chemical shifts correspond to 'H shifts with the exception of a small isotope effect and broadening, we can speculate the assignment of *H-NMR peaks based on those of 'H-NMR.

Two related biosynthetic pathways for different mugineic acids in gramineous plants. during biosynthesis and relationships of different mugineic acids in their biosynthetic pathways would be clarified using this method. When ~,~-[3,3,4,4-&]Met was fed to gramineous plants, a11 isolated mugineic acids were ’H-enriched by 10-fold. From root washings of wheat, 21.6 mg of labeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid was obtained. Relative peak intensities at 4.05, 3.93, 3.33, 3.15, 2.69, 2.50, and 2.12 ppm were approximated to 1:1:2:2:1:1:4 (Fig. 1B). According to ‘H-NMR assignment, these peaks corresponded to deuteriums at the C-4, C-l’, C- l”, C-3, C-2’, and C-2” positions, respectively. Therefore, 12 deuteriums from 3 molecules of ~-[3,3,4,4-d~]Met were incor- porated into the 2’-deoxymugineic acid. The barley roots secreted 17.2 and 2.5 mg of labeled mugineic acid and 2’-deoxymugineic acid, respectively. The 2‘-deoxymugineic acid showed a spectrum similar to that in Figure 1B. Eleven deuteriums were observed in the labeled mugineic acid whose relative peak intensities at 4.33, 3.94, 3.21,3.13, 2.56, 2.46,2.12, and 1.96ppm were approximated to 1:2:2:2:1:1:1:1 (Fig. 28). In contrast to the labeled 2‘-  deoxymugineic acid (Fig. lB),  one of the deuteriums at the C-2‘ position was lost in the labeled mugineic acid, suggest- ing that mugineic acid was derived from 2‘-deoxymugineic acid by hydroxylation at the C-2’ position. Three labeled mugineic acids (2‘-deoxymugineic acid, 1.9 mg; mugineic acid, 23.0 mg; 3-epihydroxymugineic acid, 1.6 mg) were isolated from the root washings of beer barley. The first two had spectra similar to those in Figures 1 B  and 2B, respectively. Relative peak intensities at 4.21,3.65,3.33,3.09, 2.00, and 1.90 ppm were approximated to 2:1:2:2:1:1 in the labeled 3-epihydroxymugineic acid (Fig. 3B), corresponding thus to deuteriums at the C-2’, C-4, C-l’, C-1”, and C-2” positions, respectively. One peak at 4.41 ppm was overlaid with an H20 signal. The problem was alleviated by shifting the signa1 to a lower field by lowering the temperature to 10°C during NMR measurement (data not shown). This peak was assigned to the deuterium at the C-3 position. Unlike the labeled mugineic acid, one of the deuteriums at the C-3 position was lost in the 3-epihydroxymugineic acid. Avenic acid A does not contain an azetidine ring in its structure. Mori and Nishizawa (1987) and Shojima et al. (1 989) have previously speculated that 2 ’-deoxymugineic acid is biosynthesized from avenic acid A. However, the reverse is also possible; namely, avenic acid A may be pro- duced from 2‘-deoxymugineic acid by cleavage of the azeti- dine ring. In the present study, when ~,~-[3,3,4,4-d,]Met was fed to the iron-deficient oats, one of the deuteriums at the C- 4 position was lost in the isolated avenic acid A (data not shown). However, 11 other deuteriums were incorporated in a manner resembling that of labeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid. Our data suggested that the precursor of avenic acid A was L-Met as 2’-deoxymugineic acid and that avenic acid A might be biosynthesized from 2’-deoxymugineic acid by cleavage of the azetidine ring. To confirt; this, [1,4’,4”-’3C3]2’-deox- ymugineic acid was fed to similar plants. The I3C-NMR study revealed that the isolated avenic acid A (4.4 mg) was 13C enriched by 2.6-, 2.3-, and 2.3-fold at the corresponding positions of C-1, C-4’, and C-4”, respectively (Fig. 48). This, therefore, clarified that avenic acid A did not serve as a precursor for the 2’-deoxymugineic acid. Rather, the reverse was true; namely, avenic acid A was biosynthesized from 2’- deoxymugineic acid by opening the azetidine ring between the N and C-4 positions after hydroxylation at the C-4 position. Results of the above ’H- and I3C-NMR studies reveal that L-Met serves as a precursor for a11 these mugineic acids. The present study provided the first direct evidence on relation- ships among the various different mugineic acids, especially the correlation between avenic acid A and 2’-deoxymugineic acid. Our findings suggested that there were at least two related biosynthetic pathways for mugineic acids (Fig. 5). Both these pathways shared the L-Met to 2’-deoxymugineic acid process. However, the subsequent steps differed and were dependent on the plant species. In oats, avenic acid A was biosynthesized from 2’-deoxymugineic acid by cleavage of the azetidine ring. In barley, hydroxylation at the C-2’ position in 2’-deoxymugineic acid yielded mugineic acid. Further hydroxylation at the C-3 position in mugineic acid produced 3-epihydroxymugineic acid in beer barley. So far, the intermediates between L-Met and 2’-deoxy- mugineic acid have not been isolated. Recently, nicotiana- mine has been reported as a possible previous precursor for 2’-deoxymugineic acid in the cell-free system (Shojima et al., 1990). Based on their structural features, nicotianamine might possibly be converted to 2’-deoxymugineic acid by deami- nation and subsequent reduction at  the C-3“ position, al- though direct verification is warranted. In the present study, when three molecules of ~-[3,3,4,4-d~]Met were incorporated into 2’-deoxymugineic acid, the number of deuteriums at the C-3 and C-4 positions in each molecule of Met did not change. This indicated that oxidation at the C-4 position in Met did not produce a viable intermediate.
