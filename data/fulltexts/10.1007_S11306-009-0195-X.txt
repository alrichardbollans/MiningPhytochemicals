Abstract Commercial preparations of Ginkgo biloba are
very complex mixtures prepared from raw leaf extracts by a
series of extraction and prepuriﬁcation steps. The pharma-
cological activity is attributed to a number of ﬂavonoid
glycosides and unique terpene trilactones (TTLs), with
largely uncharacterized pharmacological proﬁles on targets
involved in neurological disorders. It is therefore important
to complement existing targeted analytical methods for
analysis of Ginkgo biloba preparations with alternative
technology platforms for their comprehensive and global
characterization. In this work,
1H NMR-based metabolo-
mics and hyphenation of high-performance liquid chroma-
tography, photo-diode array detection, mass spectrometry,
solid-phase extraction, and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR) were used for
investigation of 16 commercially available preparations of
Ginkgo biloba. The standardized extracts originated from
Denmark, Italy, Sweden, and United Kingdom, and the
results show that
1H NMR spectra allow simultaneous
assessment of the content as well as identity of ﬂavonoid
glycosides and TTLs based on a very simple sample-prep-
aration procedure consisting of extraction, evaporation and
reconstitution in acetone-d6. Unexpected or unwanted
extract constituents were also easily identiﬁed in the
1H
NMR spectra, which contrasts traditional methods that
depend on UV absorption or MS ionizability and usually
require availability of reference standards. Automated
integration of
1H NMR spectral segments (buckets or bins
of 0.02 ppm width) provides relative distribution plots of
TTLs based on their H-12 resonances. The present study
shows that
1H NMR-based metabolomics is an attractive
method for non-selective and comprehensive analysis of
Ginkgo extracts.

1 Introduction
Extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves are among the best-sel-
ling herbal preparations worldwide (Warrier and Corzine
2000). Originally, only the seeds were used in traditional
Chinese medicine (Bensky et al. 2004), but in the 1960s it
was discovered that leaf extracts improved central and
peripheral blood circulation (DeFeudis 1991; Drieu and
Jaggy 2000). This led to the development of standardized
Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts (named EGb 761) containing
6% of TTLs (3.1% of ginkgolides and 2.9% of bilobalide)
and 24% of ﬂavonol glycosides (Drieu and Jaggy 2000).
Since then, the interest in crude as well as standardized
Ginkgo biloba extracts has increased dramatically, and a
series of excellent reviews of the chemistry and biology

DOI 10.1007/s11306-009-0195-x(Strømgaard and Nakanishi 2004; Singh et al. 2008),
pharmacology (Maclennan et al. 2002; Ahlemeyer and
Krieglstein 2003; Schulz 2003), analytical methods (van
Beek 2002; van Beek and Montoro 2009), and chromato-
graphic and spectroscopic properties (van Beek 2005) have
been published.
The primary constituents of standardized leaf extracts
are ﬂavonol glycosides represented by structures 1–8
identiﬁed in this work, ginkgolides A (GA, 9), B (GB, 10),
C (GC, 11), and J (GJ, 12), and bilobalide (BB, 13)
(Fig. 1). Other major classes of compounds (content[5%)
found in the standardized extract are proanthocyanidins,
carboxylic acids, and non-ﬂavonoid glycosides, whereas
biﬂavones and alkylphenols (ginkgolic acids, ginkgols and
bilobols) are removed during the manufacturing process
(van Beek and Montoro 2009). The standardized extracts
are amongst other used for symptomatic treatment of
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, peripheral occlusive arte-
rial disease, and tinnitus (Mahady 2001), and both the
TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides are thought to contribute to
the neuroprotective effect. Thus, in 1985 it was discovered
that ginkgolides are antagonists of the platelet-activating
factor receptor, which is involved in slowing the progres-
sion of neurodegenerative diseases (Singh and Saraf 2001).
Recently it was found that GB is an antagonist of the
glycine receptors and BB is an antagonist of the c-ami-
nobutyric acid receptors (Ivic et al. 2003). Flavonoid
glycosides are antioxidants that can potentially prevent
neurodegenerative diseases caused by oxidative stress
(Ramassamy 2006), and quercetin has been shown to
enhance serotonin uptake in synaptosomes from mouse
cortex (Ramassamy et al. 1992). Several animal studies
and clinical trials support the efﬁcacy of the standardized
extract, but the exact mechanism and the constituents
responsible for the effect remain largely unknown due to
contradictory results. One reason for this could be that the
majority of investigations are based on extracts that are
standardized using procedures, which do not assure the
same batch-to-batch or brand-to-brand distribution of
individual TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides. In addition,
other constituents than TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides may
contribute to pharmacological activity without being
included in the standardization.
To ameliorate the above problems, there is a need for
a non-selective analytical technique that allows assess-
ment of the global composition of the extract. Such a
method should be complementary to the existing targeted
methods based on HPLC coupled with evaporative light-
scattering detector for analysis of TTLs (Ganzera et al.
2001), with UV–VIS or PDA for analysis of ﬂavonoid
glycosides (Hasler et al. 1992b), and with various types
of MS for separate or simultaneous detection of TTLs
and ﬂavonoids (Li et al. 2002; Sun et al. 2005; Ding
et al. 2006).
High-ﬁeld
1H NMR spectroscopy can, in a single
spectrum acquired within a few minutes, provide a non-
selective metabolic ﬁngerprint of all hydrogen-containing
organic constituents in an extract present above the
detection threshold. Due to this,
1H NMR-based meta-
bolomics (Nicholson et al. 2007) has proven valuable for
data-driven analysis of complex mixtures like herbal
preparations and medicinal plants, including Hypericum
perforatum (Rasmussen et al. 2006; Lawaetz et al. 2009),
Tanacetum parthenium (Bailey et al. 2002), Ephedra spe-
cies (Kim et al. 2005), Strychnos species (Fre ´de ´rich et al.
2004), Matricaria recutita (Wang et al. 2004), and Can-
nabis sativa (Choi et al. 2004). In the current work,
1H
NMR-based metabolomics was used for investigation of
the global composition of 16 commercially available
Ginkgo biloba preparations, and HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-
NMR (Staerk et al. 2006) was used for unambiguous
identiﬁcation of eight major ﬂavonoid glycosides.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 General experimental procedures
1H NMR spectra of extracts of G. biloba preparations were
recorded at 25C using a Bruker Avance spectrometer
(
1H resonance frequency 600.13 MHz) equipped with a

1H{
13C} probe. HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR exper-
iments were performed on a system consisting of an Agi-
lent 1100 LC system, a Knauer K100 Wellchrom pump, a
Prospekt 2 solid-phase extraction device, an EsquireLC
ion-trap mass spectrometer, and the above-mentioned
Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a 30 ll
1H{
13C} ﬂow-probe, as described in details elsewhere
(Schmidt et al. 2008; Sprogøe et al. 2008). NMR experi-
ments were controlled with Bruker XWINNMR version 3.1
software, whereas all other operations were controlled with
Bruker HyStar version 2.3 or 3.2 software. HPLC-PDA
experiments were performed using a Shimadzu HPLC
system (SCL-10A system controller, SIL-10AD autoin-
jector, LC-10AT pump, CTO-10AC column oven, FRC-
10A fraction collector, and SPD-M10A PDA detector, all
controlled with Shimadzu Class-VP version 6.10 software).
Semipreparative HPLC separations were performed on an
Agilent 1200 system consisting of an autosampler, a qua-
ternary pump, a thermostated column compartment, a
photo-diode array detector, and a fraction collector. Oper-
ations were controlled by ChemStation revision B.03.02
software. Reference samples of GA, GB, GC, GJ, and BB
were in-house material from earlier studies (Jaracz et al.
2004; Jensen et al. 2007). Reference samples of glycerol
and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as well as HPLC-grade
solvents for all HPLC separations were from commercial
suppliers. Water was puriﬁed by deionization and 0.22 lm
membrane ﬁltration (Millipore).
2.2 Sample preparation
Sixteen commercial Ginkgo preparations were purchased
from health food- and pharmacy stores in Denmark (1–7),
Italy (8–9), United Kingdom (10–14) and Sweden (15–16)
during January–February 2007. Preparations 2, 8, 9, 11, 13
were capsules and the remaining were formulated as tab-
lets. Preparations 5, 6, and 7 belong to the same brand but
were sold under different names. The same applies to
preparations 11 and 12 and to 13 and 14. Tablets were
powdered whereas the content of capsules was used as is.
The amount of material used for extraction was chosen
according to information obtained from the package leaﬂet,
as summarized in Table 1. The material was extracted
three times by sonication with 100 ml of 70% MeOH for
30 min, ﬁltered, and the combined extracts were evapo-
rated to dryness at temperatures below 40C. The extract
was redissolved in HPLC-grade methanol and evaporated
to dryness before removal of residual solvent by freeze-
drying. The extractions were made in triplicates (labeled a,
b and c) for each preparation.

1232.3 NMR experiments
Samples for NMR analysis were prepared by dissolving
50 mg of the extract in 1 ml of acetone-d6 containing
0.02% of TMS. After sonication for 20 min, the samples
were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 1 min to remove
insoluble material and 700 ll of liquid was transferred to
5-mm NMR tubes. All
1H NMR spectra for multivariate
data analysis were acquired consecutively within a 48 h
time-interval with samples prepared immediately before
data acquisition. Repeated control experiments after 48 h
showed no additional variation. For each sample, 256
transients were recorded as 64 k data points with a spectral
width of 20 ppm using 30 pulses, 2.73 s acquisition time,
and an inter-pulse delay of 2.84 s. The cumulative FID was
Fourier transformed to 128 k data points using line
broadening of 0.1 Hz. All spectra were manually phase
corrected, baseline corrected, and calibrated to TMS (d 0.0)
in XWIN-NMR version 3.1.
2.4 HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR analysis
Separations of G. biloba extracts were performed at 40C
on a 150 9 4.6 mm i.d. Phenomenex C18(2) Luna column
(3 lm, 100 A ˚) with a ﬂow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a
mixture of water–acetonitrile 95:5 ? 0.1% formic acid
(eluent A) and acetonitrile–water 95:5 ? 0.1% formic acid
(eluent B). Eight repeated separations were performed
using the following gradient proﬁle: 0 min, 0% B; 10 min,
10% B; 70 min, 40% B; 75 min, 100% B; 77 min, 100%
B; 80 min, 0% B; 90 min, 0% B. Injection volumes were
20 ll of a 10 mg/ml solution (1:1 mixture of eluents A and
B), and analytes were trapped on GP phase SPE cartridges
[general-purpose poly(divinylbenzene)-based resin from
Spark Holland, 10 9 2 mm i.d.; post-column dilution with
water, 2 ml/min] using threshold-based absorbance at
254 nm for selection of analytes. The adsorbed material
was eluted to the NMR ﬂow probe with acetone-d6.
1H
NMR spectra were acquired using the NOESYPRESAT
pulse sequence with dual presaturation of solvent reso-
nances (H2O and CD2HCOCD3) during mixing time
(100 ms) and relaxation delay (2.4 s).
2.5 HPLC-PDA analysis
HPLC-PDA data were obtained for each of the 16 prepa-
rations using the above-mentioned gradient elution proﬁle.
Injection volumes of 20 ll of a 10 mg/ml solution (1:1
mixture of eluents A and B) were used. UV spectra were
acquired from 190 to 620 nm with a resolution of 1 nm/
point at a sampling rate of 1.56 s
-1 and exported as a 3D
ASCII ﬁle into MATLAB, version 7.6.0, software (Math-
Works, Natick, MA). UV-traces at 254 nm from 1 to
58.6 min were aligned using a correlation optimized
warping algorithm (Schmidt et al. 2008). Optimum seg-
ment length and slack size were found for each sample
(Skov et al. 2006). The dataset was imported into SIMCA-
P version 12 software (Umetrics, Umea ˚, Sweden) and PCA
was performed on mean-centered data without any
normalization.
2.6 NMR data analysis
The
1H NMR spectra were reduced to 425 or 850
sequentially integrated spectral regions (‘‘buckets’’) of 0.02
or 0.01 ppm width, respectively, from d 0.5 to 9 using
AMIX version 3.6.8 software (Bruker BioSpin, Germany).
The NMR data reduction ﬁle from AMIX was imported
into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for addition of labels.
Principal component analysis was performed with the
SIMCA-P version 12 software (Umetrics, Umea ˚, Sweden)
after mean-centering of data and, in some models, exclu-
sion of d 1.28–1.40, d 2.04–2.12, and d 3.28–3.36 regions.
The signiﬁcance of differences between the samples was
assessed by ANOVA test (95% probability level) of the
data matrix using Multi-Experiment Viewer version 4.0.
2.7 Semipreparative HPLC isolation
Extract (700 mg) of preparation 8 was dissolved in 40 ml
of water and extracted three times with 10 ml of HPLC-
grade petroleum ether (60–80C). Evaporation of the
pooled petroleum ether fractions yielded 19.5 mg, which
was redissolved in 500 ll of eluent B. Five separations
(50 ll each) were performed at 40C on a 150 9 10.0 mm
i.d. Phenomenex C18(2) Luna column (3 lm, 100 A ˚) with a
ﬂow rate of 4.0 ml/min of eluent B. This yielded 1.7 mg of
D
8-15:1-anacardic acid.
3 Results and discussion
Samples for
1H NMR spectral data were prepared in trip-
licate, by extraction of commercially available preparations
of Ginkgo biloba with 70% methanol, using sonication for
30 min as previously described (Choi et al. 2003; Li et al.
2004). However, contrary to these studies, all samples
were prepared without hydrolysis of ﬂavonoid glycosides
(Li et al. 2004) in order to enable simultaneous analysis of
TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides, and without prepuriﬁcation
based on solvent partitioning (Choi et al. 2003; Li et al.
2004) in order to assure that the samples reﬂect all the
extract constituents. Information from the package leaﬂet
was used to choose the number of tablets or capsules
used for extraction, in order to obtain similar amounts of
TTLs and ﬂavonoids in each extract. Table 1 summarizes
1H NMR-based metabolomics of Ginkgo biloba 295
123information about the preparations, their declared content
and the obtained amount of extract. There is clearly a large
variation in the amount of extract in each tablet or cap-
sule, and with indications obtained from the package
leaﬂet, the recommended intake of TTLs ranges from 5.4 to
12 mg/day whereas the amount of ﬂavonoids ranges from
21.6 to 48 mg/day.
Based on earlier
1H NMR investigations of Ginkgo bi-
lobaextracts (van Beek etal. 1993;Choi etal.2003; Liet al.
2004), spectra of all samples were acquired in acetone-d6
with an inter-pulse delay of 2.84 s, which assured full
relaxation of magnetization between excitations. The spec-
tra constitute the dataset for the multivariate data analysis,
and an overview of the spectra is shown in Fig. 2. Assign-
ment of individual
1H NMR resonances of GA, GB, GC, GJ,
and BB were performed by comparison with spectra of
authentic samples as well as with literature data (van Beek
2005).Due tolack ofreferencecompounds,identiﬁcation of
ﬂavonoid glycosides and assignment of their
1H NMR res-
onanceswere performedusingHPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR.
Thus, a gradient-based reversed-phase HPLC method was
developed and single HPLC-PDA data of each preparation
were obtained. Based on UV-traces at 254 nm shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1, eight major peaks were chosen for the
HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR analysis. Thus, preparations 9
and 15 were chosen for identiﬁcation of peak 1 and 2–8,
respectively, and data from the HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR
analysis are given in Supplementary Table 1. This enabled
identiﬁcation of 30,40,5,7-tetrahydroxyﬂavonol [quercetin]
(1)( S c h m i d te ta l .2008), 3-(2-O-[6-O-(p-coumaroyl)-b-
D-glucopyranosyl]-a-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-40,5,7-trihydr-
oxyﬂavone (2) (Gao et al. 1996), 3-(2-O-[6-O-(p-couma-
royl)-b-D-glucopyranosyl]-a-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-30,40,
5,7-tetrahydroxyﬂavone (3) (Tang et al. 2001), 3-(2-O-b-D-
glucopyranosyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-40,5,7-trihydroxy
ﬂavone (4) (Kazuma et al. 2003), 30-methoxy-3-(6-O-a

oxyﬂavone [isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside] (5) (Sang et al.
2002), 3-(6-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-b-D-glucopyranosyl-

nopyranosyloxy)-30,40,5,7-tetrahydroxyﬂavone (7) (Hasler
et al. 1992a), and 3-(6-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-b-D-gluco-
pyranosyloxy)-30,40,5,7-tetrahydroxyﬂavone[quercetin 3-O-
rutinoside, rutin] (8) (Clarkson et al. 2005). HPLC-PDA-
MS-SPE-NMR analysis was performed as described

NMR data of the pure compounds.
The
1H NMR data for principal component analysis
were subjected to a data reduction step before analysis. A
common data reduction procedure is integration of discrete
spectral segments (bucketing) of typically 0.04 ppm (Lin-
don et al. 2001), in order to minimize effects of chemical
shift variations. However, important information might be
lost using this procedure, and a recent study showed that
for herbal preparations where only very small chemical
shift variations are observed, the use of full resolution data
is preferable in terms of analyzing the loading plots (Ras-
mussen et al. 2006). In this study, PCA analysis was ini-
tially performed with 0.04, 0.02, and 0.01 ppm bucket
widths, which showed the same overall PCA score plots.
However, 0.04 ppm bucket widths resulted in grouping of
H-12 and tert-butyl resonances of GB ? GC and
GC ? GJ, respectively, in the same buckets. Bucket widths
of both 0.02 and 0.01 ppm allowed assessment of the rel-
ative distribution of TTLs by observing their H-12 and tert-
butyl resonances in individual buckets. However, the
0.01 ppm bucket yielded more information-rich loading
plots, which proved more valuable for identiﬁcation of
ﬂavonoid glycosides. Furthermore, inspection of the cali-
brated
1H NMR spectra showed small variations of the
resonances of the TTLs (tert-butyl group: Dm\3.0 Hz; H-
12: Dm\2.0 Hz) and of the ﬂavonoid glycosides
(Dm\1.5 Hz) (Supplementary Fig. 2), and the data for
principal component analysis were therefore integrated
with spectral segments of 0.01 ppm, corresponding to a
resolution of 6 Hz per data point.
Initial principal component analysis was performed
using the entire dataset without any normalization proce-
dures or exclusions to obtain a global overview of the raw
extract of all preparations. This resulted in a model with
seven principal components accounting for 94.1% of total
variance. The ﬁrst principal component accounted for
29.0% of the variance and the score plot differentiated
preparation 11 from all the others (data not shown). This
differentiation was due to very intense resonances (d 3.51,
2H, dd, J = 10.9 Hz and J = 5.9 Hz; d 3.57, 2H, dd,
J = 10.9 Hz and J = 5.0 Hz; d 3.51, 1H, br p, J & 5 Hz),
which were assigned to glycerol by spiking with an
authentic sample. Although glycerol is generally consid-
ered a non-toxic additive used in pharmaceutical prepara-
tions, its identiﬁcation by the PCA model clearly
demonstrates that the
1H NMR-based method identiﬁes
constituents that would not have been identiﬁed by PCA
analysis of, e.g., HPLC-UV data due to lack of
chromophores. A signiﬁcant portion of the remaining var-
iance in the data was due to the residual solvent signal (d
2.05, p,C D 3COCD2H), residual acetone (d 2.09, s),
residual methanol (d 3.31, s), and the methylene envelope
of fatty acids (d 1.29, br s). All these signals can usually be
recognized by manual inspection of the
1H NMR spectra
and the use of principal component analysis for their
identiﬁcation might appear trivial in this limited study.
However, in the unsupervised analysis of larger datasets
this approach can be used as a preliminary screening for
automatic removal of outliers or large resonance signals
from constituents that are of no importance for character-
ization of the extracts.
Preparation 11 was subsequently excluded from the
dataset, and so were regions corresponding to residual
acetone-d6, acetone, methanol, and the methylene enve-
lope. A new PCA model with four components
accounting for 86.3% of the variance was constructed
using the rest of the preparations without normalization
but with mean-centering. The resulting score plots of PC1
vs. PC2 and PC2 vs. PC3 are shown in Fig. 3a and b,
respectively, and the corresponding loading plots in
Supplementary Fig. 3. Although a few of the samples
displays a large variance between the three replicates,
supposedly caused by matrix effects, the inter-group
variance is more signiﬁcant than the intra-group variance.
This was shown using an ANOVA test at 95% proba-
bility level, and high F-values were conﬁned to spectral
regions corresponding to constituents that in the remain-
der of the work display the highest discriminant power.
Other scaling methods like univariate scaling and Pareto
scaling were also attempted, but they all resulted in
increased intra-group variance without any change in
inter-group variance.
In Fig. 3a, the samples separate along PC1 in a group
comprising preparations 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, and 16 (right-
hand side) and a group comprising preparations 2, 4, 7, 8, 9,
10, and 14 (left-hand side). According to the loadings, the
former group separates due to a higher relative concentra-
tion of TTLs and a constituent displaying the following
1H
NMR resonances: d 2.20, 1H, dtt, J = 18.0 Hz,
J = 5.5 Hz, and J = 1.7 Hz; d 2.67, 1H, dtt, J = 18.0 Hz,
J = 4.8 Hz, and J = 1.9 Hz; d 3.71, 1H, dd, J = 7.2 Hz
and J = 4.2 Hz; d 4.03, 1H, dt, J = 7.2 Hz and
J = 5.2 Hz; d 4.41, 1H, m; d 6.80, 1H, dtd, J = 3.6 Hz,
J = 1.8 Hz, and J = 0.5 Hz. These data are in accordance
with those of shikimic acid (Talapatra et al. 1989). Along
PC2, preparations with positive score values are differen-
tiated according to loadings corresponding to the tert-butyl
group of the ginkgolides and bilobalide; i.e., preparations 5,
6, 12, and 13 in the upper part of the plot contain relatively
higher amounts of ginkgolides and bilobalide. Preparations
with negative score values along PC2 (preparations 1 and 3)
1H NMR-based metabolomics of Ginkgo biloba 297
123contain higher amounts of shikimic acid. Thus, preparations
1 and 3 contain high amounts of shikimic acid, whereas
preparation 15 and 16 contain relatively high amounts of
both shikimic acid and TTLs.
In Fig. 3b, positive scores in PC2 are once again due to
high amounts of TTLs whereas negative scores are due to
high amounts of shikimic acid. Interesting, however, are
the groupings along PC3 in the right-hand side of the score
plot. Positive score values are due to relative higher
amounts of GC, GJ, and BB, whereas negative score values
are due to higher amounts of GA and GB. Thus, of the
preparations 5, 6, 12 and 13 containing relatively high
amounts of TTLs, as observed by their positive score val-
ues in PC2, preparations 5 and 6 contain relatively high
amounts of GC, GJ, and BB, whereas preparations 12 and
13 contain relatively high amounts of GA and GB. Finally,
the grouping of preparations 4 and 10 is due to loadings
corresponding to an AB system (d 2.86, AB doublet,
J = 15.8 Hz; d 2.95, AB doublet, J = 15.8 Hz). These
data are in accordance with citric acid (Couto Alves et al.
2009), which is a frequently used excipient in pharma-
ceutical preparations, even though its use may give rise to
interactions with active constituents via cyclic anhydride
formation (Higuchi et al. 1963; Larsen et al. 2009; Silver
and Sundholm 1987).
Because a very large part of variance explained in the
ﬁrst three principal components in the above PCA model
was due to shikimic acid and citric acid, variations in the
level of other constituents were not easily identiﬁable with
this model. Thus, a second PCA model was constructed,
using mean-centered data of the spectral region d 6.0–9.0,
which also enabled re-inclusion of preparation 11. This
region contains the singlet
1H resonance signals of H-12 of
all TTLs, as well as the aromatic ring signals from both the
ﬂavonoid glycosides and the ﬂavonoid aglycones. The
discrimination between different ﬂavonoid glycosides will
thus be based on discrete
1H resonance signals of the
aromatic rings of the aglycones instead of the signals of the
glycosidic moieties. Thus, this model enables simultaneous
analysis of TTLs, ﬂavonoid glycosides and ﬂavonoid
aglycones, together with all other constituents that display
signals in this region. Excluded was only the region d 6.78–
6.81 to avoid contribution from the signal of H-2 of shi-
kimic acid.
Principal component analysis resulted in a model
(Fig. 4a, b) with six principal components accounting for
96.2% of the total variance. Principal component 1
accounts for 80.6% of the variance (Fig. 4a), and as
observed with the ﬁrst model, positive scores in PC1 dif-
ferentiate preparations 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, and 16, which
contain relatively higher amounts of rutin, 2, 3, GA, GB,
GC, BB, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid than preparations
2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 (negative score values). Prin-
cipal component 2 accounts for 7.4% of the variance, and
positive score values cluster preparation 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, and
13 due to relatively high amounts of GA, GB, rutin, and
quercetin, the two latter being discriminated by their H-20
resonances at d 7.82 and 7.83, respectively, and their H-60
resonances at d 7.74 and 7.71, respectively. Negative score
values cluster preparations 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15, and 16 due
to high levels of 2, 3, GC, BB, and a constituent identiﬁed
as 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid [protocatechuic acid] based
on comparison of
1H NMR data (d 7.53, 1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz,
H-2; d 7.47, 1H, dd, J = 8.3 Hz, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6; d 6.90,
1H, d, J = 8.3 Hz, H-5) with those reported in literature
(Chiji et al. 1980). Loading plots are shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. 4. Especially interesting is the fact that
preparation 9, having one of the lowest score values in PC1
because of low intensity of all signals, is grouped together
with the preparations with high amounts of GA, GB, rutin,
and quercetin. Close inspection of the
1H spectrum shows
that the sample contains very small amounts of TTLs and

123almost no ﬂavonoid glycosides, but a high amount of
quercetin (d 7.83, 1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz, H-20; d 7.70, 1H, dd,
J = 8.5 Hz, J = 2.2 Hz, H-60; d 7.00, 1H, d, J = 8.5 Hz,
H-50; d 6.53, 1H, d, J = 2.1 Hz, H-8; d 6.26, 1H, d,
J = 2.1 Hz, H-6) This suggests that preparation 9 is pre-
sumably fortiﬁed with quercetin. Fortiﬁcation of Ginkgo
biloba extracts with commercially available quercetin is a
well-known problem that is not disclosed by traditional
analytical methods, because these involve hydrolysis of
ﬂavonoid glycosides and measurement of the amounts of
the aglycones quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol.
Looking only at preparations with positive scores in PC1
in this model, preparations 5, 6, 12, and 13 are grouped
together along PC2 (positive score values) due to high
amounts of GA, GB, rutin, and quercetin. However, prep-
arations 5 and 6 are differentiated from preparations 12 and
13 along PC3 (Fig. 4b). The loadings show that the nega-
tive score values for PC3 are due to high levels of GA, GB,
and rutin, whereas positive score values are due to high
level of quercetin. Thus, by using PC3, it is possible to
discriminate samples with relatively higher levels of
quercetin from samples with relatively higher levels of GA,
GB, and rutin. Whether preparation 5 and 6, which other-
wise are rich in TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides, are forti-
ﬁed with quercetin cannot be conclusively decided, but
several studies indicate that the levels of ﬂavonoid agly-
cones are very limited in standardized Ginkgo extracts
(Sticher 1993; Liu et al. 2005). Thus, the above qualitative
model can be used to select preparations for further tar-
geted quantitative analyses. PC3 is also able to differentiate
preparations 1, 3, 15 and 16, which cluster in the lower
right part of Fig. 4a due to high levels of 2, 3, GC, BB, and
3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. In the left part of Fig. 4b,
preparations 1 and 3 are separated from 15 to 16. Load-
ings show that this is primarily due to higher amounts of
2 and 3 in preparations 1 and 3, and higher amounts of
3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and to a smaller degree GC and
BB, in preparations 15 and 16.
A comparison between the relative amounts of TTLs
based on integrals of 0.02-ppm buckets representing the
H-12 resonances of GA, GB, GC, GJ, and BB is shown in
Fig. 5. The total integral area representing all H-12 res-
onances in each preparation was normalized and expres-
sed as a fraction of 6, which is the standard composition
of the extract EGb 761 containing 6% of TTLs (3.1% of
ginkgolides and 2.9% of bilobalide) (Drieu and Jaggy
2000), assumed to be the case for the commercial prep-
arations studied here. The majority of the preparations
follow this distribution between the ginkgolides and bi-
lobalide, although preparation 11 and to a smaller degree
preparations 9, 12, 13, and 14 differ from this by having
relatively high values of GA, and to some degree of GB.
It is worth emphasizing that Fig. 5 shows the distribution
between the individual components, and not absolute
amounts. However, because the exact pharmacological
role of the individual constituents remains unknown and
because the plot is easily prepared from information
already available from the data reduction, this method is
suggested to be implemented as a routine procedure for
characterization of Ginkgo biloba extracts to be used in
future pharmacological studies as a supplement to deter-
mination of absolute amount of total TTLs. To show that
the relative distribution of TTLs obtained by automatic
integration of buckets is, as expected, in agreement with
the distributions obtained by manual integration of indi-
vidual peaks as described elsewhere (Choi et al. 2003;L i
et al. 2004), a correlation plot was prepared (Fig. 5). It
demonstrates excellent correlation for GA (R
2 = 0.9942),
GB (R
2 = 0.9955), GC (R
2 = 0.9918), and BB (R
2 =
0.9927). Only GJ showed a signiﬁcantly lower correla-
tion (R
2 = 0.9038), which is presumably due to the low
S/N-ratio for this signal.

123Another PCA model with 11 components accounting for
94.5% of total variance was constructed using the same
spectral region d 6.0–9.0 but normalizing all spectra to the
same total intensity in this region and mean-centering. The
score plot of PC1 vs. PC2 (Fig. 6) shows once again
grouping into two main clusters due to differences in the
content of ﬂavonoid glycosides, but importantly, prepara-
tions 8 and 9 are clearly differentiated from the others.
Results from the loadings (Supplementary Fig. 5) show
that preparation 9 is now separated from the others due to
the presumed fortiﬁcation with quercetin, whereas the
separation of preparation 8 is due to the presence of
D
8-15:1-anacardic acid, i.e., (Z)-2-hydroxy-6-(pentadec-8-
enyl)benzoic acid, which was subsequently isolated by
semipreparative HPLC and identiﬁed by comparison of its
1H NMR data (d 7.32, 1H, t, J = 8.0 Hz; d 6.84, 1H, dd,
J = 8.0, 1.0 Hz; d 6.76, 1H, dd, J = 8.0, 1.0 Hz; d 5.34,
2H, m; d 2.95, 2H, t, J = 8.0; d 2.01, 4H, m; d 1.58, 2H, m;
d 1.32, 16H m; d 0.89, 3H, t, J = 7.0 Hz) with values
obtained from literature (Itokawa et al. 1987). The identi-
ﬁcation of D
8-15:1-anacardic acid, which is one of the
potential allergenic ginkgolic acids, the content of which
should be less than 5 ppm in standardized Ginkgo biloba
extracts, once again demonstrates the value of
1HN M R -
based metabolomics as a complementary method to other
targeted analytical techniques.
For comparison with the data obtained by
1H NMR, a
PCA model based on aligned HPLC-UV traces at 254 nm
(Supplementary Fig. 1) was made. The score plot of PC1
vs. PC2 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, and displays
some of the same characteristics as Fig. 4. Thus, prepara-
tions 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have higher levels of
quercetin than preparations 1, 3, 15, and 16. In addition,
preparations 12 and 13 are separated from the other due to
a much higher relative amount of rutin. However, the
scores are not inﬂuenced by the TTLs and other constitu-
ents that do not absorb at 254 nm. On the other hand,
HPLC enables a detailed analysis of ﬂavonoid distributions
(Hasler et al. 1992b), and chromatographic ﬁngerprint-
shapes are broadly used for quality assessment of complex
extract (Liang et al. 2004; Xie et al. 2006). However, both
HPLC-ﬁngerprint analysis and pattern recognition methods
based on PCA models of HPLC-DAD data suffer from the
limited structural information content of UV spectra, which
makes identiﬁcation of individual constituents difﬁcult
without access to authentic samples. These problems may
be circumvented by use of the HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR
technique as demonstrated in this work by the identiﬁcation
of ﬂavonoids, even though the analysis was limited to the
eight major constituents 1–8 due to sensitivity limitations.

1234 Concluding remarks
In conclusion, this work demonstrates that
1H NMR-based
metabolomics combined with HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR
is an attractive technology platform for comprehensive
characterization of the global composition of standardized
Ginkgo biloba preparations.
1H NMR spectroscopy is
intrinsically non-selective and information-rich, and PCA
analysis of
1H NMR spectra therefore enabled simulta-
neous assessment of TTLs and ﬂavonoid glycosides. The
method also allowed identiﬁcation of fortiﬁcation with
quercetin, simultaneous generation of relative distribution
data for TTLs, which disclosed cases of non-conformity to
standard ratio between ginkgolides and bilobalide, and
detection of the potentially harmful D
8-15:1-anacardic
acid. In addition, the analysis demonstrated the presence of
constituents that are usually not considered in the stan-
dardization protocols (shikimic acid and 3,4-dihydroxy
benzoic acid) as well as excipients (glycerol and citric
acid). All these features are of likely importance in relation
to consumer experience with Gingko products as well as
for pharmacological or clinical studies using Ginkgo
extracts. A paradigm shift from targeted analyses towards
more non-selective data-driven analytical approaches is
needed in future pharmacopoeias encompassing standard-
ized Ginkgo biloba extracts, and a full or partial incorpo-
ration of the presented methods is therefore of utmost
importance.
