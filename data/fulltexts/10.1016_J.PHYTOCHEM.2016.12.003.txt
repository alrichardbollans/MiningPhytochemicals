Potato genotypes more 23 tolerant to water shortages have been identified through assessment of yield and dry 24 matter. In the present study, a combination of metabolite profiling and 25 physiological/agronomical measurements has been used to explore complex system 26 level responses to non-lethal water restriction. The metabolites identified were 27 associated with physiological responses in three different plant tissues (leaf, root and 28 tuber) of five different potato genotypes varying in susceptibility/tolerance to drought. 29 This approach explored the potential of metabolite profiling as a tool to unravel sectors 30 of metabolism that react to stress conditions and could mirror the changes in the plant 31 physiology. The metabolite results showed different responses of the three plant tissues 32 to the water deficit resulting either in different levels of the metabolites detected or 33 different metabolites expressed. The leaf material displayed the most changes to 34 drought as reported in literature. The results highlighted genotype–specific signatures to 35 water restriction over all three plant tissues suggesting that the genetics can 36 predominate over the environmental conditions. This will have important implications for 37 future breeding approaches.  38  39 Keywords: Solanum tuberosum L., Solanaceae, metabolite profiling, plant response, 40 water restriction, tolerance, phenolic compounds 41   42  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 3 1. Introduction 43 Our changing climate, with more frequent fluctuations in temp. and precipitation levels, 44 are affecting the yield and quality of crops, such as potato, one of the most important 45 crops in the world (Bates et al., 2008). The limitation of water, like many other abiotic 46 stresses, is a particular issue in many crop plants and mobilises multiple sectors of the 47 plant metabolism as part of its stress response. Hence, presently it is difficult to 48 associate a single key metabolite with the environmental adaptation to abiotic stresses 49 (André et al., 2009; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2011). The unpredictability of weather 50 conditions, especially at critical periods such as plant emergence and tuberisation, can 51 affect the plant development and lead to dramatic yield losses (Martínez et al., 1992; 52 Obidiegwu et al., 2015). This emphasises the need for improved potato varieties that 53 can withstand those environmental stresses (Evers et al., 2010). 54 Tolerance to water limitation in plants is a well-studied topic and has been intricately 55 linked to photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism (Zingaretti et al., 2013). The 56 response pattern of plants to water restriction is regulated by the intensity, duration and 57 rate of progression of imposed water restriction and consists of a combination of 58 physiological and cellular adaptations (Jefferies et al., 1993; Obidiegwu et al., 2015).  59 Most of the water restriction related changes can be detected in the leaves, the energy 60 production organ of plants. One common response in leaves under mild to moderate 61 water limitation is to lower their stomatal conductance, thus helping to maintain the 62 water balance of the plant. Under prolonged water restriction, the cell turgor is affected 63 despite the stomatal closure which can be counteracted through osmotic adjustment. 64 Thus, the osmotic potential of the cell is lowered through accumulation of osmolytes 65  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 4 such as amino acids, sugars and polyols inside the cell (Evers et al., 2010; Morgan, 66 1984; Zingaretti et al., 2013). A side effect of stomatal closure is a reduction in net 67 photosynthesis due to limited intracellular CO2 levels (Chaves et al., 2003) which in 68 consequence leads to an increase in photorespiration, a lower carbon fixation and 69 ultimately in a reduced partitioning of assimilates affecting the tuber initiation and 70 bulking (Loon, 1981). 71 Water limitation, equal to many stress conditions, causes a rise of reactive oxygen 72 species (ROS) which can lead to oxidative damage within the cells. Genes implicated in 73 the detoxification of ROS were identified as up-regulated in potato upon drought stress 74 (Watkinson et al., 2008). Most of these genes are responsible for increased production 75 of metabolites (e.g. phenylpropanoids), with antioxidant properties, able to scavenge 76 ROS (Cruz de Carvalho, 2008; Dixon et al., 1995). 77 Metabolite profiling approaches have the potential to provide valuable phenotypic 78 information on a broad range of metabolites across metabolic pathways that contribute 79 to plant processes and responses to external stimuli or stresses (Jespersen et al., 80 2015). Capturing metabolite levels over a resolved time-course, can provide successive 81 snapshots of the metabolism which provides a dynamic overview of the current 82 metabolic status of the plant. This methodology is useful in investigating the complex 83 interacting mechanisms of cellular metabolic pathways in response to perturbations 84 such as drought stress (Kim et al., 2007). 85 The need for more tolerant potato varieties that can withstand fluctuation in water 86 availability and still deliver good yields and quality has becomes the focus of modern 87 breeding programs. For a better understanding of the different drought sensitivity of five 88  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 5 potato breeding clones, those clones were subjected to water restriction followed by a 89 metabolite profiling approach to establish global changes arising across sectors of 90 metabolism. The present study focused on untargeted and targeted analysis of 91 metabolite features in leaves at 30 days after water restriction initiation (DAWRI) and 92 leaves, roots and tubers at 70 DAWRI of five potato genotypes under a control 93 treatment (CT) and water restriction (WR). Additionally, physiological properties of the 94 plants, including osmotic potential (OP), photosynthetic activity (Asat) and several others, 95 were measured to monitor adaptive responses of the clones. Collectively, these data 96 will enable (I) the assessment of the different responses to water restriction throughout 97 the plant, (II) link physiological and metabolic properties and (III) connect the degree of 98 tolerance to key metabolites and/or biochemical pathways. 99   100  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6 2. Results and Discussion 101 2.1 Physiological and agronomical measurements defining tolerance/susceptibility 102 The WR treatment was started 28 days after sprout transplanting in order to expose the 103 plants to water stress during tuberisation and bulking and evaluate the resulting 104 metabolic changes throughout the potato plant. PCA analysis was used to identify the 105 physiological traits with the greatest contribution to the five genotypes varying in 106 tolerance to drought. Physiological traits with the highest eigenvalues (top 15%) were 107 considered to have the greatest impact for a component. The biplot (Supplementary 108 Fig.1B) of physiological/agronomical data (loadings) and genotypes (scores) highlighted 109 a clear clustering between CT and WR treatments. The loadings HI of dry and fresh 110 weight, CCI at all time points and OP at 0 to 15 DAWRI were associated with the WR 111 cluster and the loadings biomass of fresh and dry weight, Asat and gs at 15 DAWRI and 112 RWC at 35 and 70 DAWRI were correlated with the CT cluster. This was to be expected 113 as well-watered plants have more excess water available (RWC) leading to “normal” 114 plant performance /biomass production, whereas plants under water-stress focus their 115 intracellular processes on tuber development instead of leaf production resulting in a 116 higher HI (Obidiegwu et al., 2015). 117 For agronomical purposes, it is important that the plant maintains tuber formation and 118 development despite the water dependent reduction in photosynthetic capacity (Legay 119 et al., 2011). Therefore, biomass and HI define the DTI and are distinct indicators to 120 assess differences in tolerance between potato clones (Table 3) (Cabello et al., 2013). 121 The clones, investigated in this study, were chosen for their abiotic stress properties 122 and showed similar HI to previous studies (e.g. Ramírez et al., 2015a). All clones had 123  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 7 higher HI values under WR and according to those same values, CIP397077.16 had the 124 best performance followed by CIP390637.1, CIP392797.22, CIP394611.112 and 125 CIP395448.1. Interestingly, CIP397077.16 showed no significant difference between the 126 HI of dry and fresh weight under WR and CT conditions. The total biomass at 70DAWRI 127 showed that the clones with lower HI values, CIP392797.22, CIP394611.112 and 128 CIP395448.1, weighed more than the two better performing clones. Hence, the DTI was 129 calculated to establish a precise ranking of tolerance of the five clones investigated. The 130 DTI values (Supplementary Fig.1A) described CIP397077.16 as the most tolerant 131 followed by CIP392797.22, CIP394611.112, CIP390637.1 and CIP395448.1. In this 132 respect, the DTI results for CIP395448.1 differed from the expected high tolerance 133 properties established in the breeding program (Table 2) (Mihovilovich et al., 2015). 134 This indicated that under the growth conditions of the present study the CIP395448.1 135 clone could not use the available water as effectively as reported previously (Ramírez et 136 al., 2015b). 137 The underlying metabolic processes of the leaf, tuber and root material were evaluated 138 with untargeted analysis, revealing between 3000 and 7000 metabolite features, and 139 with targeted analysis, identifying ~60 compounds including primary (e.g. glucose, malic 140 acid) and secondary metabolites (e.g. carotenoids, phenolic compounds). The 141 untargeted analysis was visualised as a PCA plot (Fig. 1) and highlighted the 142 environmental conditions (CT and WR) as the main differentiator within each of the 143 three plant parts, as seen for the physiological/agronomical data (Supplementary Fig.1). 144 This corroborates that the metabolome is linked to the physiological properties and vice 145 versa (Peng et al., 2015). The least separation was detected within the root material 146  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 8 (Fig. 1D). CIP395448.1, the only clone with a BW population background, showed a 147 separate cluster from the other four clones within both treatments. This indicated 148 significant differences in the metabolic composition. For a more detailed view of the 149 clustering patterns, PCA analysis was performed of solely CT or WR treated leaf 150 samples at 30 and 70 DAWRI (Supplementary Fig.2). The clusters of the clones within 151 each treatment had the same trends as the combined score plots (Fig. 1A, B). However, 152 leaves under WR at 70 DAWRI showed the least pronounced cluster (Supplementary 153 Fig.2D), which suggested similar metabolic adaptations under stress conditions (e.g. 154 accumulation of phenylpropanoids (Wegener et al., 2015)) despite the genotypic 155 differences. The PCA analysis of leaves and tuber showed a general trend of clusters 156 (Fig. 1A, B) and indicated a similar metabolic composition of the tolerant clone 157 CIP397077.16 and CIP390637.1. Even though, the latter clone showed a lower DTI 158 than expected. This would suggest that the majority of metabolic changes activated 159 under WR are the same between the two clones and a few specialised pathways 160 influenced the better performance of the tolerant clone CIP397077.16. The cluster of the 161 medium-tolerant clone CIP392797.22 was located closely to the cluster of the latter two 162 clones. The sensitive clone CIP394611.112 of the LTVR population clustered the 163 furthest away from the other three LTVR clones and was closest to CIP395448.1, the 164 other sensitive clone with BW population background. This is an interesting finding 165 insofar, as the metabolic differences of the two sensitive clones could be influenced by 166 the different backgrounds and their metabolic similarities could be related to metabolic 167 traits causing the susceptibility to the WR condition.  168  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 9 The metabolic changes, specific to each clone under WR conditions, were elucidated 169 through the more detailed targeted analysis. For this purpose, a direct comparison of 170 metabolite levels under WR and CT was performed and revealed a variety of changes 171 and similarities between genotypes and population background (Fig. 2) which will be 172 discussed hereafter in connection with physiological traits. 173 2.2 Photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content under WR 174 The chlorophyll content was measured as CCI in SPAD units and together with other 175 photosynthesis related isoprenoids by UPLC. The SPAD units showed significant 176 differences between clones at all measurements (0, 15, 25 and 70 DAWRI), but 177 statistical differences between treatments were evidenced at 25 DAWRI, and genotype 178 by treatment interaction at 70 DAWRI (Supplementary File 1). In average, CCI of plants 179 subjected to WR were significantly greater than those of the CT at all times points 180 (Table 3), even before the WR treatment was initiated (0 DAWRI), which need to be 181 taken into account for the evaluation of further time points. The CCI values for both 182 plant treatments increased until the last measurement at 70 DAWRI with the exception 183 of the two tolerant clones (CIP397077.16 and CIP390637.1). Both these clones had 184 significantly decreased CCI values under WR conditions, whilst the other clones 185 retained higher values than their controls. All breeding clones but the tolerant clone 186 CIP397077.16 increased their CCI values significantly under WR at 25 DAWRI. The two 187 susceptible clones CIP394611.112 and CIP395448.1 also showed a significant increase 188 in CCI values at 25 DAWRI and maintained the increased CCI values until 70 DAWRI.  189 The UPLC measurements at 35 DAWRI showed no significant change of any of the 190 photosynthesis related isoprenoids for the four LTVR clones and for CIP395448.1 191  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 10 decreased levels were detected of antheraxanthin and two violaxanthin isomers by less 192 than 0.1 fold. At 70 DAWRI, CIP395448.1 showed no change of any isoprenoids, 193 whereas the four LTVR clones showed significantly decreased levels of chlorophyll a 194 and b. Only the genotypes of the LTVR population showed increased levels of 195 phytoene, a carotenoid precursor, by ~1.1 fold at 35 and 70 DAWRI. This could indicate 196 a switch of GGPP utilisation from the predominant use for chlorophyll synthesis to 197 carotenoid synthesis (Zingaretti et al., 2013) and correlates to downregulated genes for 198 chlorophyll synthesis (Legay et al., 2011). 199 A comparison of the two chlorophyll measurements indicated very different results. 200 However, certain trends of those results become visible when both analysis are used for 201 the interpretation of adaptations under WR. The adjustment of the photosynthesis 202 processes is directly linked to the utilisation of available water resources and the carbon 203 allocation to the tuber (Obidiegwu et al., 2015). The chlorophyll content seemed to be 204 the determining factor for the photosynthesis processes in the clones studied, as both 205 Asat and gs, known to be lowered under drought to conserve water (Obidiegwu et al., 206 2015), did not change for any clone at any time point measured. The mid-tolerant clone 207 CIP392797.22 had a similar chlorophyll/violaxanthin profile to the tolerant 208 CIP397077.16 and also showed a decrease of CCI from 25 to 70DAWRI. This might be 209 a factor for the better performance of CIP392797.22 than the reportedly tolerant 210 CIP390637.1, which showed a decrease of CCI but far less change of chlorophyll 211 levels. Furthermore, the chlorophyll content could be a deciding factor for the metabolic 212 difference of the two susceptible clone. Even though both showed the same trends of 213 CCI values, the lack of change in chlorophyll levels of CIP395448.1 probably led to a 214  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 11 quicker consumption of already limited water, enhancing the drought stress on the plant 215 and reducing the tuber formation or development (Zingaretti et al., 2013). 216 2.3 OP and RWC and related metabolites affecting tuber formation 217 Significant differences in RWC between treatments were detected at 35 DAWRI with an 218 average RWC decrease of 5% under WR and a 7% increase under CT (Table 3). This 219 trend continued up to 70 DAWRI and showed statistical differences between breeding 220 clones (Supplementary File 1). WR samples showed a further 18% decrease at 70 221 DAWRI resulting in RWC values between 60-70%, whereas CT samples maintained 222 RWC values above 90%. Interestingly, the OP only showed difference between 223 treatments at 15 DAWRI and remained similar for the remaining experiment between 224 control and stressed plants and between genotypes (Table 3). CIP394611.112 under 225 WR showed statistically lower OP values than under CT at 15 DAWRI and maintained 226 decreasing OP values until the last measurement. The other four clones maintained 227 their cellular pressure under WR treatment (Supplementary File 1). 228 On the biochemical level, most of the metabolite changes associated with drought 229 responses (e.g. sugar and osmolytes accumulation (Zingaretti et al., 2013)) were 230 detected in the leaves of the LTVR accessions. The metabolite changes common to all 231 five genotypes in leaf were a decrease of citric acid and increases of gluconic acid, 232 ribitol and metabolites of the phenylpropanoid pathway, in particular phenylalanine and 233 naringin. The increase of naringin was above 2.5 fold for all genotypes at 70 DAWRI. 234 The highest increase of naringin in response to water restriction was detected in 235 CIP397077.16 by 68.2 fold at 70 DAWRI, followed by CIP390637.1 and CIP394611.112 236 with a 37.8 and 28.1 fold increase, respectively. The increase of phenylalanine and the 237  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 12 decrease of citric acid was less at 70 DAWRI than at 30 DAWRI for all genotypes 238 except CIP397077.16. The lack of change in osmolytes levels and reduced levels of 239 phenolic compounds in the sensitive clone CIP395448.1 appears to be a contributing 240 factor to this clone’s comparative inability to adapt to drought conditions. The lack of 241 osmolytes and phenolic compounds under water deficiency leads to a deformation of 242 the transportation system of the plant (xylem) and further interferes with its ability to 243 retain water from the soil (Zingaretti et al., 2013). These phenotypic effects were 244 observed for the sensitive clone CIP395448.1, as both the OP and RWC values, 245 displaying cellular pressure and turgidity, were reduced at 25 and 70DAWRI. The 246 second highest reduction of RWC and OP values was observed for the other sensitive 247 clone CIP394611.112. Contrary to this, one of the most distinct features of the tolerant 248 clone CIP397077.16 was a delayed increase of phenylpropanoid formation in the 249 leaves. This delayed increase of phenolic compounds in combination with the induction 250 of one specific phenolic compound (naringin, a glycoside of naringenin) could infer a 251 more efficient ROS scavenging mechanism of this genotype under drought. Activation 252 of naringenin chalcone synthase has been shown to play a particular role for tolerance 253 of potato plants to stress conditions (Vasquez-Robinet et al., 2008). Furthermore, the 254 high levels of phenolic ROS scavengers could delay leaf senescence induced by 255 oxidative stress and aid the photosynthetic processes leading to a better carbon fixation 256 and resource allocation to the tuber which corresponds to the better DTI performance of 257 this clone compared to the others (Obidiegwu et al., 2015; Rivero et al., 2007; 258 Schippers et al., 2007).  259  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 13 Another metabolic trait related to tuber formation/development is the allocation and 260 conversion of sucrose to starch. Within the leaf samples, the clones of the LTVR 261 population showed increased levels of saccharides such as fructose, glucose, inositol 262 and ribitol of which most had an above 2.5 fold increase at 70 DAWRI. No change of 263 sucrose levels was detected in leaf of any of the genotypes. The components of the 264 TCA cycle from succinic to malic acid were increased from ~2.0 to above 2.5 fold at 30 265 and/or 70 DAWRI, contrary to the 0.5 fold decrease of citric and isocitric acid. The clone 266 CIP395448.1 showed very little metabolite changes, which included a decrease of citric 267 and isocitric acid by 0.6-0.7 fold at 30 DAWRI and a 1.7 fold increase of ribitol and 0.7 268 fold decrease of mannose at 70DAWRI. The metabolite levels in the LTVR clones 269 suggested an active turn-over from fructose to the TCA cycle which was reported for a 270 resistant accession as a result of higher mitochondrial metabolic activity (Vasquez-271 Robinet et al., 2008). Within the tuber samples, no change of glucose/fructose or 272 intermediates of the TCA cycle could be seen (Fig. 3). These leaf and tuber results 273 suggest that only the yield but not the development of the tuber was affected, as seen 274 by the biomass/HI results and previously described for an acclimated accession of 275 Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena (Watkinson et al., 2008). 276 2.4 Phenylpropanoids and other metabolites in tuber 277 Stress-induced metabolism can vary between different plant parts (Dixon et al., 1995) 278 and the range of metabolites identified in tubers, 45 in total (Fig. 3), varied as expected 279 from the leaf material. The intermediates of the phenylpropanoid pathway varied not 280 only in content but also in composition between the leaves, tuber and roots. The three 281 phenylpropanoids, naringenin, rutin and umbelliferone, detected with increased levels in 282  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 14 the leaf material of WR treated plants, showed no change or even decreases in the root 283 material. An exception was the susceptible clone CIP395448.1 which showed an 284 increase of naringin in the roots. This metabolic adaptation could be related to the 285 clone’s BW resistance as naringin and other flavonoids in roots are known to confer 286 antimicrobial properties against soil-borne bacteria (Szoboszlay et al., 2016). In tuber, 287 only umbelliferone was detected next to other phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic 288 acid, as reported previously (Navarre et al., 2013). The genotypes CIP397077.16 and 289 CIP395448.1 had increased levels of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic and 290 cryptochlorogenic acid. CIP392797.22 only had increased levels of caffeic and ferulic 291 acid, whereas the remaining two clones showed no change in phenylpropanoids. The 292 importance of phenolic compounds, despite the different expression in the three plant 293 parts, was shown through the phenylalanine content which was induced (2.6 to 4 fold) in 294 all genotypes in leaf and tuber and supports the hypothesis that drought stress is 295 perceived differently in each plant part and activates tissue specific regulators (Dixon et 296 al., 1995; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2011). 297 Amino acids were the second metabolite group with significant changes in tuber. 298 Glutamine, a central component in plant nitrogen metabolism, was increased by 2.3 to 299 3.0 fold in four of the five genotypes, whereas CIP394611.112 produced proline at 25.5 300 fold under WR conditions. Those ratios of both glutamine and proline were not detected 301 in the leaf material. Other amino acids, including leucine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, 302 methionine, tryptophan and serine, were increased in CIP392797.22, CIP394611.112 303 and CIP390637.1 by 1.9 to 7.4 fold changes and in the case of CIP390637.1 leucine 304 showed an increase by 15.3 fold. Only the changes of tryptophan were consistent 305  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 15 between tuber and leaf material at 70 DAWRI. These changes of amino acids in 306 combination with phenylpropanoid results indicated a negative correlation between the 307 content of free amino acids and phenolic compounds in tuber (Fig. 3). This could be 308 related to induced protein degradation due to lack of ROS protection (Krasensky et al., 309 2012) or an increase of free amino acids acting as osmolytes in addition to the ROS 310 protection through phenylpropanoids (Yancey, 2001). 311 In general and contrary to the leaf material, hardly any changes of saccharides were 312 detected in tubers under WR compared to CT conditions. Inositol, relevant for 313 osmoprotection, was increased in the LTVR clones by a fold change of ~2.4 for 314 CIP392797.22 and CIP394611.112 and ~5.9 fold in CIP390637.1 and CIP397077.16. 315 The clone CIP395448.1 showed no change of inositol levels, but had a 1.6 fold increase 316 of another saccharide, sorbose. Overall, CIP395448.1 tuber material showed the least 317 metabolic changes under WR and differed very little in the metabolite levels from the 318 tolerant clone CIP397077.16, even though their leaf material showed significant 319 differences. 320 2.5 Tolerance properties affecting tuber quality 321 One aspect that has to be taken into consideration by breeders producing more tolerant 322 potato varieties, is the change in sensory attributes of the tuber such as taste and 323 texture. In this study, the distinct metabolic features of clone CIP397077.16 highlighted 324 genetic traits which can overcome the water stress environment more effectively 325 compared to the other genotypes. These metabolic features included the late onset of 326 changes in chlorophyll and phenylpropanoid levels in leaf and increased levels of 327 phenylpropanoid in tuber. The disadvantage of these increased levels in tuber is that 328  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 16 most phenylpropanoids are known to confer bitterness taste properties (Ripoll et al., 329 2014). This has been the unforeseen consequences of various breeding programs 330 where the focus of biotic and abiotic resistance has precluded consideration of 331 consumable traits preventing the uptake of the varieties into real life scenarios. The 332 clone CIP392797.22 would be a suitable compromise between harvest loss and taste 333 properties. This clone showed the second best DTI, a higher total biomass and no 334 changes of phenylpropanoid levels in the tuber. 335 As illustrated in the present study, the use of metabolite profiling provides detection of 336 potential taste/aroma influencing compounds within accessions. The incorporation of 337 these technique into characterisation of germplasm will enable breeding programs to 338 pyramid multiple traits for resistance, productivity and also consumer preferences. 339   340  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 17 3. Concluding remarks 341 The present study showed that the successful adaptation to water deficit displayed by 342 several of the selected clones does have a measurable biochemical component. The 343 adaptation processes are complex and require the interaction of several key pathways 344 to maintain key cellular processes necessary for “normal” plant development/growth. 345 The metabolite profiling highlighted that a distinct metabolic signature can only really be 346 seen in a comparison to other clones as adaptation to drought stresses involves multi-347 pathway adaptation rather than the introduction or presence of one novel 348 compound/marker (Zingaretti et al., 2013). Monitoring metabolite levels over time, to 349 create a dynamic picture, demonstrated the ability of the tolerant potato clones to fine 350 tune metabolite compositions to the degree of stress experienced by the plant and its 351 capacity to deal with this stress condition (Vasquez-Robinet et al., 2008). Overall, the 352 incorporation of metabolite profiling datasets augments the elucidation of the 353 biochemical mechanisms underlying the physiological adaptations. 354 355  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 18 4. Experimental 356 4.1 Plant material and experimental design 357 Five potato genotypes differing in their sensitivity to water stress (Table 1) (Cabello et 358 al., 2012; Carli et al., 2014; Ramírez et al., 2015a) were selected for their similar 359 vegetative maturity (≤120 days) and population background from CIP breeding program. 360 Four of the clones are part of the lowland tropic virus resistant (LTVR) population 361 (Bonierbale et al., 2003) and the fifth clone is part of an ancient population bred for 362 resistance to bacterial wilt (BW) (Table 1) (Mihovilovich et al., 2015).  363 The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions from September to 364 December 2013, at CIP experimental station in Huancayo, Peru (3200 meter above sea 365 level). Atmospheric temp. and humidity (HOBO U23 Pro v2 Temp./Relative Humidity 366 Data Logger –U23-001, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) were 367 recorded every 10 min using a mini data –logger (HOBO U12 Outdoor/Industrial Data 368 Logger, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) (Table 2).  369 Tubers of the five genotypes were planted in plastic trays filled with 1:1 rinsed fine –370 textured sand and gravel and after 22 days later, thirty vigorous sprouts of each 371 breeding clone were extracted (cut out from the tubers) and sown individually in 12 372 inches pots filled with 15kg of the same sand and gravel mixture. Pots were distributed 373 following a split block design with three replicates of ten pots per genotype; half of them 374 received a different water treatment. Plants grown from sprouts were watered by drip 375 irrigation (4L/h) and all fertilisers were injected directly into the irrigation water. 376 Fertilisation was performed with 5.18g l-1 potassium nitrate, 3.36 g l-1 ammonium nitrate, 377 2.68 g l-1 calcium triple superphosphate, 1.15g l-1 magnesium sulphate, 120g l-1 fetrilon 378  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 19 combi micronutrients, and 96g l-1 iron quelate. Pest control was carried out with the 379 application of two insecticides Rovral (active ingredient: Iprodione; Bayer CropScience, 380 Peru) and Beta baytroid (active ingredient: Beta cyfluthrin; Bayer CropScience, Peru) at 381 0.16 g l-1.  382 All plants were watered every other day for 30 days before the water restriction (WR) 383 treatment initiation. The WR treatment consisted of applying half of the amount of water 384 supplied to the control treatment (CT). Irrigation frequency in WR was performed in an 385 interval of around nine days depending on daily temp. (Table 2) which was repeated 386 eight times over a total period of 80 days. The CT plants continued to be watered with 387 the same frequency as the first 30 days. 388  389 4.2 Physiological and agronomical measurements 390 4.2.1 Total biomass, Harvest Index determination and Drought Tolerance Index  391 At harvest (80 days after water restriction initiation (DAWRI)), total fr. wt and dry wt 392 were determined. The dry wt of each plant was measured, in triplicate or more, after 393 drying all the components at 80°C for 3 days in a forced air oven. The harvest index (HI) 394 was calculated as the ratio of DW tuber (g) to the total DW biomass (g). The drought 395 tolerance index (DTI) was calculate according to DTI= ((yield under stress x yield under 396 control)/mean yield under control) (Saravia et al., 2016). 397 4.2.2 Osmotic potential (OP) 398 Leaf osmotic potential was determined at 0, 15, 35 and 70 DAWRI in leaf discs of 5mm 399 diameter, taken from the third fully extended leaf of at least three plants per clone and 400  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 20 treatment. Leaf discs were transferred into cryogenic tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen 401 for further analysis. The frozen leaves were incubated at 22°C for 30 min in a sealed C-402 52 chamber (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) prior to determination of the osmotic 403 potential with a dew point microvoltmeter (HR-33T from the same company).  404 4.2.3 Relative water Content (RWC) 405 RWC was determined at 0, 15, 35 and 70 DAWRI by weighing the third leaflet from the 406 youngest fully expanded leaf (third leaf from the apical part) (fr. wt) and placing it in a 407 4x3 inch Ziploc bag containing distilled water for 24 h. Excess water was removed by 408 blotting each leaf in a paper towel prior to taking turgid weight (TW). Leaves were then 409 dried in an oven at 90 ºC overnight and reweighed (dry wt). RWC was calculated 410 according to RWC (%) = [(fr. wt–dry wt) / (TW–dry wt)] x 100 (Barrs et al., 1962). The 411 RWC mean value was established from triplicate measurements of each clone per 412 treatment. 413 4.2.4 Chlorophyll content index (CCI)  414 Chlorophyll content was determined at 0, 15, 25 and 70 DAWRI as a CCI value using a 415 portable chlorophyll meter (Minolta SPAD-502, Konica Minolta, Sakai, Osaka, Japan). In 416 each plant, three leaflets of the youngest fully expanded leaf (third node) were used to 417 measure the transmittance of red (650 nm) and infrared (940 nm) radiation through the 418 leaf. The average CCI of the three leaflets provided by the average option of the 419 instrument was recorded as an individual CCI plant value. This was repeated in at least 420 three plants of each clone per treatment and replication.  421  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 21 4.2.5 Photosynthetic activity (Asat) and stomatal conductance (gs) 422 Light-saturated net CO2 assimilation rate (Asat) and stomatal conductance (gs) were 423 measured at 15, 25 and 70 DAWRI on the youngest fully expanded leaves, in at least 424 three plants of each clone per treatment and replication. Asat and gs were measured with 425 a portable gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li–COR, Lincoln, USA). Leaf chamber 426 conditions was set up at 385 ppm CO2, 23.5 ºC (block temp.), a saturated photon flux 427 density (1500 µmol m-2 s-1) and ambient relative humidity. 428 4.3 Metabolite analysis  429 4.3.1 Extraction of metabolites 430 Leaf tissue samples at 30 DAWRI and leaf, tuber and root tissue samples at 70 DAWRI 431 of both treatments were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvest and ground 432 to powder. Samples, including quality controls (pool of all samples, QC), were weighed 433 (10±0.5 mg) in plastic tubes and extracted as described previously (Nogueira et al., 434 2013). Aliquots of the polar and non-polar phase were immediately dried down after 435 extraction. 436 4.3.2 GC-MS analysis. 437 An aliquot of the polar phase (200µl) was removed and internal standard ([D4]Succinic 438 acid, 10µg) added before dry down. Dried samples were derivatised as previously 439 described (Nogueira et al., 2013) and analysed by GC-MS based on literature (Enfissi et 440 al., 2010), using a 10:1 split mode. Metabolites were identified with respect to an in-441 house library based on retention time, retention indices and mass spectrum (Nogueira 442 et al., 2013) and quantified relatively to the internal standard. 443  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 22 4.3.3 LC-MS analysis 444 Each dried aliquot of the polar phase (700µl) was resuspended in methanol/water (1:1, 445 100µl) and internal standard (homogenistic acid, 5µg) added. Samples were filtered 446 using syringe filter (nylon, 0.45µm) before analysis based on a published LC-MS 447 method (Enfissi et al., 2010) with modification of solvents A (water and 0.1% formic 448 acid) and B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was held at 100% A for 1 449 min, followed by a gradient up to 35% B until 18 min and to 95% B until 19 min. The 450 gradient was then held at 95% B for 4 min and the column returned to the initial 451 conditions within 1 min and equilibrated for 5 min. Data analysis was performed based 452 on R package metaMS (Shahaf et al., 2013; Wehrens et al., 2015) with a retention time 453 window match set to 0.5min. 454 4.3.4 Chromatographic analysis with UPLC 455 For analysis of carotenoids and chlorophylls, an aliquot of the non-polar phase (350µl) 456 was dried, resuspended in ethyl acetate/acetonitrile (1:9) and analysed as previously 457 described (Nogueira et al., 2013). Metabolites were identified through specific retention 458 time and UV/visible light spectrum and quantified from dose-response curves (Fraser et 459 al., 2000). 460 4.3.5 Data processing and statistical analysis 461 Principal component analysis (PCA) using a correlation matrix to standardise the 462 variables was performed to identify components which contributed the greatest variance 463 between genotypes. Statistical analysis was perform using JMP® Pro 12.0.1 (SAS 464 Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and Simca P 13.0.3.0 (Umetrics, Sweden). Statistical analysis 465  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 23 was performed using the computing environment R v 3.2.4 (The R Foundation for 466 Statistical Computing, 2016). Changes in identified metabolites between WR and CT 467 samples were calculated as average ratios. Their significance was established through 468 pairwise comparison with Student’s t test for the metabolic data and Fisher’s least 469 significant difference (LSD) for the physiological data (P < 0.05). Results for leaves were 470 displayed in a heat map using Excel 2013 (Microsoft Office, USA). Metabolite changes 471 in tuber were overlaid with biochemical pathways constructed specifically with 472 BioSynLab software (wwww.biosynlab.com). 473  474 Acknowledgements 475 The authors would like to thank Mariela Aponte and Chris Gerrish for their excellent 476 technical assistance.
