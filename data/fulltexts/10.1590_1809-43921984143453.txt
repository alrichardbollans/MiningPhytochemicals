THE CHEMISTRY OF BRAZILIAN LEGUMINOSAE. LXI. (+)-METHYL VOUACAPENATE FROM VOUACAPOUA PALLID IOR. Silvia M.C. Dias (*) J. Guilherme S. Maia (**) Zenaide S. Ferreira (***) Otto R. Gottlieb (***) SUMMARY The wood o{j Vouacapoua ραΙΙίχϋοΛ. [lQ..Qimlnoòan-Ca2J><xíplnÁ.oidnaí) contaA.no ( + )-meXhul vouacapznate.. The genus Vouacapoua Aubl. (family Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) comprises three arboreous species found in tropical South America where they are popularly known under the collective designation "acapu". Their wood is of great durability and has been ex­ploited in Construction, mostly of flooring and furniture, for so many years that the trees are nearing extinction (Rizzini ε Mors, 1976). V. americana Aubl. and V. macropetala Sandw. have been examined previously with respect to thei r chemica 1 const i tuents. Wood samples of both species were found to contaiη (+)-methyl vouacapenate (Sploelstra, 1 9 3 0 ; King et al., 1955). In continuation of our work on the chemistry of Leguminosae (for Part LX see Dias et al., 1982), we wish to re port that the trunk wood of V.pallidior Ducke also contains a substantial quantity of the same compound. Methyl vouacapenate is also accesscible through total synthesis (Spencer et al., 1 9 7 1 ) . EXPERIMENTAL Trunk wood of V.pallidior (voucher INPA herbarium 58-612) was collected at the (A) Instituto Biológico, Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento do Estado de São Paulo, 04014 - São Paulo, SP (**) Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia - INPA/CNPq - Caixa Postal 478 -69000 Manaus, AM (***) Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo - 05508- São Paulo, SP ftCTA AMAZÔNICA 1^(3- 2 *) : ^ 5 1 - ^ 5 3 - 1984. 451 Forest Reserve A. Ducke, ne*ar Manaus. A ground sample (0.7 kg) was extracted by perco­lation with ethanol. The solution was evaporated and the residue (18 g) was washed sue cessively with light petrol, benzene and chloroform. The petrol solution, upon concen­tration and cooling, gave a precipitate (2g) which was filtered and crystallized from methanol to (+)-methyl vouacapenate, mp 103-104°, ja| D + 120° (c 1.5, C C1^) ; lit.

The benzene solution was evaporated and the residue (0.9 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column. Elu-tion with benzene gave fatty material; and elution with benzene - chloroform 1.1 and chloroform gave fatty material plus sitosterol. All fractions contained small propor -tions of methyl vouacapenate. The chloroform solution was evaporated and the residue (0.8 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column. Elution with benzene gave again fatty material, sitosterol plus a trace of methyl vouacapenate; and elution with ben­zene-ethyl acetate 1:1 and 3:7 gave additionally another compound. The latter two frac tions were united and evaporated. The residue was crystallized from chloroform to the KR r* 1 compound (1.5 m g ) , mp 187-193°.

The minute amount and low stabili­ty of the compound obtained precluded further examination.
