ABsTRAcT.--From Berberis hohiana, Berberis btimcIìuc/,[ìa, Berberis /uiirìnu, and Berberis 
parrcìdentata, twenty-one isoquinoline alkaloids were isolated. B .  /airha yielded a new com- 
pound, berberilaurine 111, a bisbenzyleetrahydroisoquinoline with two diarylether bridges in 
between C-7 to C-5 and C- 1 1 to C- 12'. 
Local pharmacopoeiae still reveal sources of new potent drugs for treatment of 
parasitic diseases in developing countries. In this respect, several Bolivian Indian tribes 
have been recorded to treat: cutaneous leishmaniasis with, among others, Berberidace- 
ous plants. In vitro, crude extracts of Bolivian barberries show leishmanicidal and 
trypanocidal activities. This prompted us to examine the phytochemical content of 
these species. The present paper describes the alkaloid content of four species collected 
on the Bolivian altiplano: Beyheris boliviunu Lechl., Berheris bumeliu~ofoliu Schneid., Ber- 
beris luarim Billbg., and Berberispuucide?ztutu Rusby. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
From these four species, 21 alkaloids were isolated of which one is new: ber- 
berilaurine [l], related to lauberine [2), a bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid of 
sub-group H with two diarylether bridges between C-7 to C-5' and C-11 to C-12'. 
[The bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids classification adopted here is the one 
introduced by Guinaudeau et al. (2). ]  Its structure was established from the following 
evidence. 
Berberilaurine {l) is a levorotary labile compound, isolated in a small amount (8 
mg). Its uv spectrum is that of a typical bisbentyltetrahydroisoquinoline (1). A slight 
bathochromic shift in basic solution indicates the presence of one or more phenolic 
.

groups. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 (Figure 1) is essentially the same as that of 2 (2). It 
differs by signals near 3.90 ppm, accounting for only two methoxy groups (compared to 
three in 2) ,  thus suggesting a structure in which a methoxyl of 2 is replaced by an hy- 
droxyl. Assignments of the other signals were made by analogy with 2. The eims spec- 
stitution pattern. The fragmentation of bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline proceeds 
to single and double charged bisisoquinolic ions (3). The single charged bisisoquinolic 
bisisoquinolic ion appears at m/z 184 (base peak). This indicates that the upper half of 
is substituted by a methoxyl. The position of the methoxyl in the bisisoquinolic moiety 
delay time of 125 msec. The two coupling cross peaks between methoxyls and aromatic 
and 3.95-6.79 ppm. Thus, the 12-OMe (coupled to H-13 appearing at 6.81 ppm) res- 
8' (appearing at 6.79 ppm) and, therefore, is borne by the C-7'. Therefore, 1 has the 
structure of the 6-O-demethyllauberine and was given the trivial name of berberi- 
trum exhibits a molecular ion at m/z 594 (C36H3801N2) in agreement with this sub- 
mainly by double benzylic cleavage of single and double charged molecular ions leading 
ion appears at m/z 368 and m h  367 by loss of H ' ,  while the double charged 
the molecule bears one methoxyl and two hydroxyl groups and, therefore, that the C-12

The alkaloid composition of the four Berberis species is presented in Table 1. As ex- 
pected, all species proved to be rich in berberine, above all in the roots. The roots ofB. 
pmm2entatct yielded more than 20 g/kg of berberine. The main tertiary alkaloids of B ,  
Bolìvìktc, B.  hcmeli&4olìa, and E.  pctlcc;nent~ttn are bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinolines of 
subgroups B and C. This composition also was seen in the majority of BerBeris,species 
quinolines of subgroups D and H. 
Another sample of B .  Imoivrl, originating from Rio de la Plata, part of its known 
geographical distribution ( 5 ) ,  was previousiy examined (6-8). There are differences be- 
tween the alkaloidal compositions of these two specimens. The Rio de la Plata sample 
showed espinine and espinidine, which may be viewed as precursors of bisbenzyltetra- 
hydroisoquinolines of subgroups D and H. The Bolivian sample contains the new al- 
kaloid berberilaurine {l] but no single bridged bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline. The 
chemical differences between the two specimens may be due to different edaphic condi- 
tions or different physiological stages at  collection time, or may be genetically fixed, 
previously analyzed (4). E ,  lrlitrintr contains predominantly bisbenzyltetrahydroiso-

'M = major alkaloid (more than IOW of the crude alkaloids); m = minor alkaloid (less than IOW of the crude alkiiloids). Estimates 
are based on examination of the crude alkaloid mixtures by tlc. 
Such variations in alkaloid content have already been observed in Hermzndiu peltutu 
(9,lO) and in Albertisiupupimzu (11,12). This fact leads one to be cautious about the 
taxonomic significance of the occurrence of particular compounds. The only relevant 
observation is that B .  luarinu is so far the only reported Berberis species with bisbenzyl- 
tetrahydroisoquinolines of subgroups D and H as major tertiary components. 
The biological activities of some of the bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinolines isolated in 
the course of this work will appear in separate papers (13,14). 
EXPERIMENTAL 
GENERALEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-Uncorrected mp's were determined in capillary tubes on 
a Biichi 5 10 apparatus. Optical rotations were measured with a Schmidt-Haensch Polartronic I polarime- 
ter. Uv spectra were recorded on a Beckman 530 spectrometer. Ir spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 
580 apparatus. 'H-nmr spectra were recorded on Varian EM 360 A(60 MHz) and Bruker AC 300 TF (300 
MHz) spectrometers. Ms spectra were recorded on a Varian MAT 3 11 instrument. 
PLANT MATERIAL.-B. boliuiatza roots (1.9-kg) and stems (1.9 kg) were collected in June 1985 along 
the Collana road, km 27.5, La Paz district, Bolivia, at 3900 m altitude, under the reference AF 584. B .  
61mzeliaefIia roots (0.9) were collected in October 1986 in the vicinity ofNavaez, Tarijadistrict, Bolivia, at 
900 m a l t h d e ,  under the reference AF 7 18. B .  lawina roots (0.4) were collected in August 1985 along the 
Collana road, km 11, La Paz district, Bolivia, at 3900 meters altitude, under the reference AF 586. B. 
kaacidearata roots (O.  58 kg) stems (0.8 kg) were collected in April 1986 along the Collana road, km 11, La 
Paz district, Bolivia, at 3900 m altitude, under the reference AF 624. 
Voucher specimens are deposited at the Instituto Boliviana de Biologica de Altituda (I.B.B.A.) her- 
barium. 
EXTRACTION AND ISOLATION.-After removing the lipids by petroleum ether, the powder was al- 
kalinized and extracted with CHCI, in a Soxhlet apparatus. The alkaloidal mixture was further purified by 
the usual acid-base treatment. Crude alkaloidal extracts yielded as follows: B .  boliviana roots, 25 glkg; B.  
boliviana stems, 7.9 glkgi B .  biinielia~olia roots, 4.1 glkg; B.  l a i h a  roots, 5.25 g k g ;  B .  paticidentala 
roots, 2.4 glkg (and 20 glkg berberine chloride, which precipitated in acidic water during workup); B. 
paucidentata stems, 2.4 glkg. Alkaloids were then separated by cc. Columns were packed with Merck 60 
column Si gel (art. 7734) and eluted with mixtures of C,H$CHCI ,/MeOH of increasing polarity or packed 
with Merck 60 H tlc Si gel (art. 7736) and eluted with CHCI3-MeOH-NHqOH (99-92: 1-8:O.l-0.5). 
Preparative tlc on Mcrck 60 HF2,4 Si gel (art. 7735) was also performed in solvent systems of CHCI,-
