Through NMR,chemometrics along with metabolite pathway analysis it is observed the overexpression of the saccharides su-crose (from 2.30 ± 0.32 to 2.71 ± 0.14 g/100 g), raﬃnose (from 0.86 ± 0.04 to 1.02 ± 0.07 g/100 g), andstachyose (from 3.37 ± 0.12 to 4.13 ± 0.28 g/100 g) in stored beans (regardless atmosphere conditions), in-dicating changing on galactose, and starch and sucrose pathways that are intrinsically linked to germination andsprouting processes. Those mechanisms seem to be partially activated after 6 months since amino acids or lipidmetabolism were not aﬀected. Therefore, storage conditions induce the role in regulating the germination andsprouting processes but do not aﬀect the germination capability of the seeds (data not shown). The beans storedin low humidity showed less luminosity and chroma values, and relative reduction of proanthocyanidin B-typedimer, epi-catechin, and kaempferol, which indicate darkening when submitted to high humidity with controlledatmosphere.1. IntroductionThe chemical proﬁle of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) canchange according to storage conditions (Prolla et al., 2010). Storageunder adverse conditions as high temperature and humidity induces thehard-to-cook (HTC), a textural defect that aﬀects its quality (K. Liu,McWatters, & Phillips, 1992). The impermeability of the bean coatoccurs due to oxidation of tannins and formation of protein-tannincomplexes (Pirhayati, Soltanizadeh, & Kadivar, 2011). Furthermore, theenvironment during the storage may cause changes in seed metabolismand inﬂuence the physiological quality of seeds (Delouche & Baskin,2016). Therefore, the use of reduced oxygen levels and increase ofgases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen to control storagepests, can lead to inhibition of biochemical processes as sucrose, aminoacids, and lipids biosynthesis (Geigenberger, 2003).Modiﬁed atmosphere technologies are well-known methods and arealternative for preserving beans quality by reducing chemical changes(Vanier, Rupollo, Paraginski, de Oliveira, & Elias, 2014) and extendingshelf life due to the decrease of microorganisms incidence (Freitas,Faroni, & Sousa, 2016). In normal atmosphere conditions, the con-centrations of nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are78%, 21%, and 0.04% respectively, along with small percentages ofother gases. In order to increase the shelf life of products stored undercontrolled atmospheres, it is necessary to reduce O2 concentrations to1–3% while increase levels of CO2 to 2–20% (de Souza Aguiar et al.,2015).Therefore, the aim of this study was evaluate the compositionvariability of common bean under diﬀerent storage conditions using thequantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (qNMR), and Ultra-HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography coupled to High Resolution MassSpectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) to evaluate the chemical changes ac-cording to diﬀerent controlled atmosphere conditions as storage periodand levels of O2, CO2, and humidity.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108673Received 16 April 2019; Received in revised form 23 September 2019; Accepted 24 September 2019∗ Corresponding author.E-mail address: elenilson.godoy@yahoo.com.br (E.G.

SamplesPhaseolus vulgaris type Pinto Bean (cv. IAC Imperador) was har-vested on January 2016 in a farm located at Paraná State, Brazil – la-titude 24°54′74″S, longitude 54°03′50″W. These beans were harvested,cleaned, and stored in raﬃa bags with moisture content of 11%.2.2. Experimental layoutThe experimental design was completely randomized with four re-plications. Approximately 350 g of dry beans were placed in diﬀerentstorage conditions of CO2 (0.04 and 9%), O2 (1.5 and 21%) and relativehumidity (40 and 70%), as described in Table 1. In controlled atmo-sphere, 350 g were stored in raﬃa bags and placed in 15 L airtightvessels (N=3). These conditions were obtained with nitrogen andcarbon dioxide (White Martins Gases Industriais Ltda, Cascavel, Brazil).Both gases were mixed to obtain the oxygen (1.5 KPa) and carbondioxide (9.0 KPa) levels and were monitored for six months using anelectronic analyzer – Agri-Datalog™ Oxidox II Isocel (Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil). The relative humidity (40 and 60%) and temperature (20 °C)were adjusted and controlled by a dehumidiﬁer and air conditioner,respectively. After six months a subset of samples were maintainedunder ambient atmosphere at 25 °C (stored at ambient condition – sl) toevaluate the capacity of metabolic restoration. At the end of the ex-periments, 100 g of beans were frozen at −25 °C for 24 h and freezedried (Terroni, model Enterprise II, São Carlos, Brazil). A controlsample before storage was obtained as described above.2.3. NMR analysisFor NMR analysis, the bean coat was manually separated from thecotyledon. The cotyledon were powdered, and approximately 30.0mgwere soaked in a mixture of 600 μL of D2O and 1mM of TMSP-d4 (so-dium-3-trimethylsilylpropionate-2,2,3,3-d4). The solutions were mixedfor 2min at room temperature and centrifuged at 804.6 g for 2min. Thesupernatants were transferred to 5mm NMR tubes.Table 1Storage conditions of the common beans (P. vulgaris).Experiment % O2 (kPa) % CO2 (kPa) Storage period Relative humidityT1(HCLH) 1.5 9 6 months 40%T2(LCLH) 21 0.04 6 months 40%T3(HCHH) 1.5 9 6 months 70%T4(LCHH) 21 0.04 6 months 70%T5(HCLH.sl) 1.5 9 6 months +7 days sl 40%T6(LCLH.sl) 21 0.04 6 months +7 days sl 40%T7(HCHH.sl) 1.5 9 6 months +7 days sl 70%T8(LCHH.sl) 21 0.04 6 months +7 days sl 70%Legend: LCLH – low CO2 level, low humidity; LCHH – low CO2 level, high humidity; HCLH – high CO2 level; HCHH – high CO2 level, high humidity; sl - storage innormal atmosphere at 25 °C.Fig. 1.

LWT - Food Science and Technology 117 (2020) 1086732The NMR experiments were performed on an Agilent 600-MHzspectrometer equipped with a 5mm (H–F/15N–31P) inverse detectionOne Probe™ with actively shielded Z-gradient. The 1H NMR spectrawere acquired with 32 free induction decays (FID), 48 k of time domainpoints for a spectral window of 16 ppm, under quantitative parametersat 298 K: acquisition time of 5.0 s and a recycling delay of 25.0 s (de-termined by the inversion-recovery pulse sequence). The spectra wereprocessed by applying exponential line broadening of 0.3 Hz, zeroﬁlling of 32 k points, and referenced to the TMSP-d4 resonance at δ 0.0.The identiﬁcation of the constituents was performed through 1H–1HCOSY, 1H–13C HSQC, and 1H–13C HMBC experiments, supplementaryopen access database (http://www.hmdb.ca) and literature reports(Alves Filho, Silva, Teoﬁlo, Larsen, & de Brito, 2017; Choze et al., 2013;Lião et al., 2011). Complete signaling is provided in SupportingInformation (SI).2.4. LC-MS analysisThe bean coat samples were grinded and 200mg was sonicated(40 kHz, Eco-Sonic, Brazil) in 10mL of acidiﬁed methanol: acetic acid(90/10, v/v) during 1 h at 25 °C. The supernatant was ﬁltered on PTFE0.2 μm membranes (Whatman, Merck, Germany) and 5 μL was injectedinto the UPLC system (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA). The UPLC ana-lysis was performed with Acquity UPLC BEH column (150×2.1mm,1.7 μm; Waters) on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. The column tem-perature was set at 40 °C. The binary gradient elution system consistedof 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile(B), with linear gradient from 2 to 95% B (0–15min), with a ﬂow rate of0.4 mLmin−1. The proﬁling was obtained by a Xevo Q-TOF massspectrometer (Waters) with electrospray ionization (ESI) interface op-erating in negative ionization mode in the range of 110–1180 Da withscan time of 0.1. The desolvation gas was nitrogen set at 350 °C withﬂow rate of 500 L h−1. The capillary and cone voltages were adjusted to2.6 kV and 0.5 V, respectively. The mass accuracy and reproducibilitywere maintained by infusing lock mass (leucine-enkephalin,0.2 ng μL−1; [M-H]− ion at m/z 556.2771) and molecular formula as-signments were obtained by MassLynx 4.1 software (WatersCorporation). The identiﬁcation of the organic compounds was per-formed considering the respective m/z values, fragmentation proﬁle,and literature reports.2.5. Color measurementColor was determined using a Minolta CR-410 chromameter(Minolta, Japan) with granular-materials attachment CRA50. A whiteporcelain plate (Y = 85.8; x = 0.3195 and y = 0.3369) was used forcalibration, and an illuminat D65 (day light) to data collection for L*(luminosity), a*, and b* values. The hue angle (h*) and chroma (C*)values were determined based on a previous publication (Giusti,Caprioli, Ricciutelli, Vittori, & Sagratini, 2017).2.6. Statistical analysis2.6.1. Multivariate statistical analysisThe NMR and LC-MS dataset were evaluated by multivariate sta-tistical analysis. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectra and chromatogramswere converted to American Standard Code for InformationInterchange (ASCII) ﬁles to covariance matrices construction separatelyFig. 2.

LWT - Food Science and Technology 117 (2020) 1086733for each analytical method. For NMR dataset, unsupervised chemo-metric evaluation was performed by Principal Component Analysis(PCA) using The Unscrambler X™ program 10.4 (CAMO software,Woodbridge, NJ, USA). The area of non-deuterated water suppression(δ 4.70 to 4.90 – according to the saturation proﬁle evaluation) wasexcluded. For LC-MS dataset, the chromatograms region between 0.5and 8.0min was used to perform PCA.The alignment using COW (Correlation Optimized Warping) algo-rithm was applied over the NMR and LC-MS datasets. For HCA, thevariables were mean-centered and Ward's method using SquaredEuclidian distance was applied for distance metric. Singular ValueDecomposition (SVD) algorithm was used for PCA, which were carriedout after the baseline correction, normalization processing, and mean-centered processing over the variables (composition).In order to evaluate the variables that posses higher impact on thebeans composition after controlled atmosphere, the classiﬁcation modelusing Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) algorithm was applied using the PLS Toolbox™ program (version8.6.2, Eigenvector Research Incorporated, Manson, WA, USA). It wasperformed pair comparison of control versus the treatments that leads tohigher impact on the beans composition (as observed by PCA): controlversus atmosphere with high humidity level (regardless the CO2 level);control versus atmosphere with low humidity level (regardless the CO2level) at 6 months; control versus samples conditioned for 6 months(regardless the atmosphere condition); control versus samples condi-tioned for 6 months plus 7 days of shelf life (regardless the atmospherecondition). The loadings and coeﬃcient plots were analyzed and thevariables important for projection (VIP) with values higher than 1 werequantiﬁed and used as input for metabolic pathway analysis usingMetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) (Chen et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2017, 2018; Xia, Psychogios, Young, & Wishart, 2009). Theorganic compounds were quantiﬁed by an external reference methodprovided by the software VnmJ™ (version 4.2, Agilent) (Freitas et al.,2018; Lião et al., 2011).2.6.2. Univariate statistical analysisThe color data results were submitted to analysis of variance usingthe software Origin™ 9.4. The variables with signiﬁcant diﬀerencesaccording to F-test (p < 0.05) were submitted to mean comparison byTukey's test (p < 0.05).3. Results and discussion3.1. Primary metabolites variability of the cotyledon by NMRThe composition of the P. vulgaris cotyledon was evaluated after 6months of storage: with low CO2 level and low humidity (LCLH); lowCO2 level and high humidity (LCHH); high CO2 level and low humidity(HCLH); high CO2 level and high humidity (HCHH); and after an ad-ditional 7 days storage under ambient condition. Fig. 1 presents acomparison among the 1H NMR spectra from each experimental con-dition and control.The spectra showed that the common bean comprised a high level ofaliphatic, carbohydrates, and aromatic compounds (for completeFig. 3. Metabolic pathway analysis using MetaboAnalyst: (a) overview altered metabolic pathways; b) galactose metabolism pathway; c) starch and sucrose me-tabolism. The colour and size of each circle is based on the p value and the on value of pathways impact and the highlighted pathways were selected based on falsediscovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05.

LWT - Food Science and Technology 117 (2020) 1086734signaling see Supplementary Information). The major compounds de-tected were oligosaccharides (conﬁrmed by cross-link of anomericproton from glucose units with quaternary carbon of the fructose at δ106.7 observed by HMBC) and sucrose. Therefore, in order to under-stand the variability of the primary metabolites in common beans ac-cording to diﬀerent storage conditions, an unsupervised chemometricanalysis by PCA was performed, which exhibited a separation tendencyof the samples along PC1×PC2 with 75.84% of the total varianceexplained (Fig. 2).The scores plot presented the main tendency of separation of thecommon bean under diﬀerent storage conditions according to the PC1axis. The examination of the loadings showed the most important me-tabolites that lead their discrimination. In general, the principal in-formation was the cotyledon metabolism recovery by the storage atambient condition after the controlled atmosphere storage, from posi-tive to negative values of PC1. In particular, beans stored under highhumidity level and submitted to subsequent storage at ambient condi-tion (HCHH.sl and LCHH.sl) are located close to control, showing theircapacity to restore the metabolism. The common beans stored with lowCO2 level and low humidity (LCLH and LCLH.sl) located at positivescores of both PC1 and PC2 axes, presenting the lower amount of themajor compounds (negative PC2 loadings).For comprehensive analysis of the metabolites, a supervised che-mometric method by PLS with pair wise comparison (discriminantanalysis of control versus the selected storage conditions) followed bythe data orthogonalization was performed to assists the model inter-pretation (Izquierdo-García et al., 2011). The compounds with VIPscores higher than 1 were considered statistically signiﬁcant for twoclasses discrimination. The analysis of those variables showed that re-gardless the used storage condition (atmosphere and time), the im-portant metabolites were the same: raﬃnose (δ 5.42), sucrose (δ 5.42),stachyose (δ 5.46), verbascose (δ 5.46), acetylcholine (δ 3.21), citricacid (δ 2.58) and acetic acid (δ 1.92). This fact was in accordance withthe PCA analysis, which showed the main variation with respect to PC1axis. Therefore, the control samples versus 6 months of storage wereused as model for metabolites analysis. In order to quantify the sucroseand oligosaccharides separately, some considerations were made. It waspossible to obtain the value of sucrose and raﬃnose separately byconsidering the integration of the signal at δ 5.00 (hydrogen ofanomeric linkage between glucoses) of the oligosaccharides, which is 1for raﬃnose, 2 for stachyose, and 3 for verbascose (Alves Filho et al.,2017; Lião et al., 2011). In addition, the signal at δ 5.46 was consideredsolely from stachyose since the content of verbascose was nearly to zeroin beans, especially in Pinto beans (Iyer, Salunkhe, Sathe, & Rockland,1980; Moghaddam et al., 2018).To identify the relevant pathways linked to metabolites variationafter the storage conditions, the variables were submitted toMetaboAnalyst (Xia et al., 2009; Xia & Wishart, 2011). As shown inFig. 3a, eight pathways were suggested to be associated with the me-tabolism response to storage conditions. However, pathways with falsediscovery rate (P < 0.05) were considered as aﬀected by the storageconditions, which includes galactose metabolism (Fig. 3b), and starchand sucrose metabolism (Fig. 3c). The metabolites in deep red color toyellow indicates an increased concentration of metabolites in storedbeans and also higher impact on pathway and –log(P).In non-photosynthetic tissues as beans, sucrose is the material forseveral metabolic pathways, providing energy and carbon skeletons forthe production of amino acids, nucleotides and structural carbohydrates(Stein & Granot, 2019). In addition, raﬃnose and stachyose are also allclosely associated with plant energy metabolism (Eveland & Jackson,2011). In the galactose metabolism pathway, it was observed that theoverexpression of certain saccharides as sucrose, raﬃnose, and sta-chyose were induced by storage conditions. As consequence to sucroseincreasing, the starch and sucrose metabolism was also aﬀected. Starch,sucrose, and galactose metabolisms participate in the germination andsprouting processes (Chen et al., 2019).

LWT - Food Science and Technology 117 (2020) 1086736seems possible that storage conditions induce the role in regulating thegermination and sprouting processes. However, it was not observedchanging on amino acids or lipid metabolism that are also related to theaforementioned mechanisms. Therefore, those mechanisms seem to bepartially activated after 6 months regardless the atmosphere conditions.Despite this, the germination capability of the seeds after the storagetime and conditions were not compromised as observed in the germi-nation experiments (data not shown).3.2. Bean coat analysisIt was characterized some of the major compounds according totheir m/z and fragmentation proﬁles (Table 2). A comparison amongtypical chromatographic proﬁles from bean coats are illustrated inFig. 1SI.The presence of procyanidin, catechin, kaempferol derivatives, andsaponins was detected. The compounds 2 (γ-glutamyl-methylcystein)and 6 (γ-glutamyl-leucine) showed [M-H]- ion at m/z 263.0693 and259.1290, with fragments at m/z 128, and 197, 130, 128, relatives tothe loss of methylcysteine, glutamic acid, and leucine. The compound 4showed a precursor ion at m/z 451.1240 and fragment product at m/z289.0716, which is compatible to the loss of hexose in catechin and,therefore, it was characterized as catechin-O-hexoside (Journi,Hammouda, Trabelsi-Ayadi, & Chérif, 2015). The compounds 3, 5,8–10 exhibited [M-H]- at m/z 577, 865, and 1153, respectively. Thesecompound and fragments were compatible with procyanidin B-typedimer, trimer, and tetramer isomers (Zhang & Zhu, 2015). The com-pounds 7 and 15 exhibited precursor ion [M-H]- at m/z 289.0720 and285.0388, which correspond to catechin and kaempferol, respectively,by comparison with standard. In Phaseolus, kaempferol is commonlydetected in O-glycosidic form. The compound 11 showed a precursorion [M-H]- at m/z 447.0915 and fragment at m/z 285.0386, compatiblewith kaempferol product ion. Accordingly, it was identiﬁed as kaemp-ferol-O-hexoside (Abu-Reidah, Arráez-Román, Lozano-Sánchez, Segura-Carretero, & Fernández-Gutiérrez, 2013). The compounds 13, 17–20exhibited molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 1105.5471, 957.5059, 941.5061,1067.5435, and 921.4853, which were characterized as soyasaponinA2, V, I, Bg, and γg, respectively (Suh et al., 2016). The compound 16with molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 327.2167 was tentatively assigned astri-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid based on the fragmentation pattern(Simirgiotis et al., 2017). The compounds 1, 12 and 14 were notidentiﬁed.The aforementioned compounds were detected in all samples indiﬀerent intensities. Therefore, due to the elevate complexity of thedata chemometric analysis was developed. Fig. 4 shows the PC1×PC2scores plot, discriminating samples regarding diﬀerent storage condi-tions with 73% of the total variance explained. Fig. 4b and c show thecorresponding loadings graph for both PC1 and PC2 axes, respectively.Common bean stored under low humidity was located at positivescores of PC1 and negative of PC2 and furthermore, those beans storedunder high CO2 condition were located at higher positive scores of PC1and PC2 concomitantly. This fact was related to appropriated storage,since low O2 and high CO2 atmosphere with reduced humidity lead toarthropods death during grain storage, preserving the bean quality(Freitas et al., 2016). At negative scores of PC1 are located the beanssubmitted to additional 7 days of storage at ambient condition, and thebeans stored under high humidity with low CO2 level (closest to storageat ambient condition), which indicate the reactivation of the metabo-lism after withdrawal of the beans from the controlled atmosphere.According to loadings graph from PC1 (Fig. 4b), it was noticeablethe reduction of procyanidin B-type dimer, epi-catechin, and kaemp-ferol in beans submitted to 7 days of storage at ambient condition, aswell as beans stored at low CO2 and high relative humidity. In general,pigments responsible for bean coat color are ﬂavonoids (Ranilla,Genovese, & Lajolo, 2007). The proanthocyanidins are oligomeric ﬂa-vonoids originated from the condensation of catechin, epicatechin, andgallic acid esters. This class of compounds oxidizes to reactive quinonesthat interact with proteins, resulting in the darkening of the bean coat(Coutin et al., 2017). Therefore, the decrease of procyanidin B-typedimer, kaempferol; and epi-catechin can be associated to bean coatdarkening after 7 days of storage at ambient condition as corroborateby color evaluation (Fig. 5). In addition, it also indicated that the beanssubmitted to low CO2 and high relative humidity might present coatdarkening. Often, kaempferol content reduces after darkening(Beninger et al., 2005).For beans located in negative scores of PC1, an increase in contentof the saponins soyasaponin Bg, soyasaponin I, soyasaponin V was ob-served. The soyasaponins are triterpenoid aglycones, and commonlyfound in P. vulgaris (Kitagawa et al., 1988). Therefore, higher content ofsaponins after 7 days of storage at ambient condition may indicate therestoration of the bean metabolism. This dynamics is more noticeableby observing the loadings graph of PC2 axis (Fig. 4c), in which beanssubmitted to high CO2 and high relative humidity presented highamounts of the saponins. It is known that bean coat chemical patternand color in P. vulgaris is controlled by a group of genes, which regulatethe ﬂavonol and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways (McClean, Lee,Otto, Gepts, & Bassett, 2002). Therefore, alterations in storage condi-tions aﬀected the biosynthesis of these compounds.3.3. Bean colorSince the color of common bean is an important visual attribute andpresents important inﬂuence on consumer's intention-to-buy and ac-ceptability, the coat color was evaluated in order to correlate to storageconditions (Fig. 5). The common bean storage under low humidity(40%) showed highest luminosities, which indicate the preservation ofthe lighter color. However, the color was not inﬂuenced by diﬀerentCO2 levels or 7 days of storage condition after controlled atmospherestorage because no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed (95% of re-liability). It is known that common bean stored under high temperatureand/or humidity are susceptible to development of hardening anddarkening phenomena (Coelho, Prudencio, Christ, Sampaio, &Schoeninger, 2013). Therefore, beans stored in lower humidity pre-sented higher L* (luminosity) and C* (chroma) values, as well as in-creases in amounts of proanthocyanidin B-type dimer, epi-catechin, andkaempferol contents (Fig. 4b). The low procyanidin B-type dimer con-tent was coherent with darkening of the bean coat due to proantho-cyanidin oxidation to reactive quinones (Ranilla et al., 2007). Hueangles (H*) from stored beans were similar and ranged within the 90°region, suggesting an apparent reddish yellow color.4. ConclusionThe NMR spectroscopy coupled to chemometrics enables the studyof eﬀected pathway of the beans submitted to controlled atmosphere. Itwas observed changing on galactose, starch and sucrose pathways thatare closely associated to regulation on the germination and sproutingprocesses. However, it was not observed changing on amino acids orlipid metabolism, and metabolites also linked to aforementioned me-chanisms, indicating that those mechanisms seems to be partially ac-tivated after 6 months regardless the atmosphere conditions. For LC-MSanalysis, it was observed that common beans stored under low relativehumidity presented highest luminosity and chroma values, which wascorroborated by the reduction of proanthocyanidin B-type dimer, epi-catechin, and kaempferol contents indicating correlations betweencolor and chemical parameters. These ﬁndings showed bean coat dar-kening when submitted to high humidity during the controlled atmo-sphere storage. Through the LC-MS analysis, it was also observed highercontent of saponins after 7 days of storage at ambient condition, as wellas in the beans stored at low CO2 and high relative humidity, indicatingthe restoration of bean metabolism. In general, seeds presented viabilityfor germination after storage time regardless the atmosphere condition,S.R.M. Coelho, et al.
