RESUMO: “Cornosídeo e outros constituintes do látex de Parahancornia amapa (Hub.) 
Ducke (Apocynaceae) uma planta medicinal no Norte do Brasil”. O látex de Parahancornia 
amapa, popularmente conhecido como “leite do amapá” foi extraído com hexano, diclorometano 
e metanol. As frações obtidas com hexano e diclorometano forneceram misturas de 3-O-acil-
lupeol e triterpenos confi rmando resultados de estudos já realizados. No extrato metanólico 
identifi cou-se uma grande quantidade de mistura de carboidratos, metilmioinositol e derivados 
de feniletanóides tendo como principal constituinte o cornosídeo. Estes constituintes foram 
identifi cados através da análise de espectros de IV, RMN 1H e 13C e CG-EM das frações e do 
derivado acetilado do cornosídeo e do metilmioinositol. 
Unitermos: Parahancornia amapa, amapa, feniletanóides, carboidratos, cornosídeo, ésteres de 
lupeol.
ABSTRACT: Latex of Parahancornia amapa which is known as “amapa milk” in folk medicine 
was extracted with hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. From the hexane and dichloromethane 
were identifi ed mixtures of 3-O-acyl lupeol esters such as identifi ed previously. In the methanol 
extract, a large amount of carbohydrates, the phenylethanoid glucoside known as cornoside, 
other phenylethanoids derivatives and methylmyoinositol were identifi ed. The analysis of IR, 
NMR and GC-LRMS of the natural compounds and tetra-acetylcornoside and comparison with 
literature data were used to identify the compounds.
Keywords: Parahancornia amapa, amapá, phenylethanoids, carbohydrates, cornoside, lupeol 
esters.
INTRODUCTION
Parahancornia amapa (Huber) Dicke 
(Apocynaceae) is a tree which occurs in the State of 
Amapá in the Brazilian Amazon region. It is commonly 
called “amapa milk”, its latex is used in scars and bruises 
as plaster treatment, it is also mixed with honey, in equal 
quantities, to be used as a drink for treatment of asthma, 
bronchitis and physical weakness (Van den Berg, 1982). 
In the previous phytochemical study of this specie 
we reported the presence of sitosterol, stigmasterol, 
sitosterone, friedelin, lupeol, β-amyrin, α-amyrin, their 
acetyl derivatives, besides 3β-O-acyl lupeol esters in 
bark, latex and roots of this plant (Carvalho et al., 2001; 
Sobrinho et al., 1991). These pentacyclic triterpenes, its 
acyl derivatives and the mixtures of four n-acyl-lupeol, 
four 3β-hydroxy-n-acyl lupeol and two β,δ-dihydroxy-
n-acyl-lupeol were identifi ed in the non-polar fractions 
of the latex from P. amapa (Sobrinho et al., 1991). In 
this paper we describe an additional study directing the 
identifi cation of polar constituents in the latex from P. 
amapa. The presence of phenyletanoid glycoside and 
acyl lupeol esters in Parahancornia reveal biochemical 
metabolism different from Himatanthus (Barreto et al., 
1998; Veloso et al., 1999; Abdel-Kader et al., 1997; Silva 
et al., 1998), Plumeria (Adam et al., 1979; Hamburger 
et al., 1991; Coppen & Cobb, 1983; Kardono et al., 
1990) and Allamanda (Coppen & Cobb, 1983; Abdel-
Kader et al., 1997) that have been identifi ed as source 
of iridoids. On the other hand, it is in agreement with 
Jensen et al (2005) that cornoside often substitutes 
iridoid glucosides in plants where these are expected to 
be present. Considering that these kinds of compounds 
have been found in important herbal medicine (Teshima 
et al., 1996), these phenylethanoids and inositol can be 
the active compounds in the used polar fraction from 
the latex of P. amapa called as “amapa milk” by the 
folk medicine. An additional consideration is that the 
unadvised people substitute the latex from P. amapa 
with the one from Hmatanthus that has iridoids and 
sugars as polar compounds in its latex (Barreto et al., 
1998).

MATERIAL AND METHODS
General procedures
Melting points have not been corrected. IR 
spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1605 FT-
IT spectrophotometer. 1H (200.0 MHz) and 13C (50.3 
MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Brüker AC 200 
spectrometer using DMSO-d6, D3COD or CDCl3 with 
TMS as internal standard. Electron Ionization Mass 
Spectra (LREI-MS) were taken with Gas Chromatograph 
coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) on a 
Varian Saturn 2000 using ion trap and 70 eV. Column 
chromatography with silica gel (Vetec and Aldrich 
0.05-0.20 mm) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma, USA); 
for preparative TLC was used silica gel F254 G (Vetec), 
and silica gel TLC plates w/UV254, aluminum backed 
(Sorbent) were used to analyze the fractions collected 
from column chromatography (CC) with visualization 
under UV (254 and 366 nm), Lieberman-Burchard and/
or Godin reagents or exposure to iodine vapor.
Plant material
The used material was collected from one 
specimen identifi ed by the botanist Benedito Vitor 
Rabello in State of Amapá, Brazil. The voucher specimen 
(no 07231) is deposited at the Herbário Amapaense 
(HAMAB) of the Divisão de Botânica do Museu Ângelo 
Moreira da Costa Lima, Instituto de Estudos e Pesquisas 
do Amapá (IEPA), Macapá-AP, Brazil. 
Extraction
The dried latex (100.0 g) was extracted by 
maceration three times with hexane, dichloromethane and 
with methanol at room temperature. The solutions were 
obtained by fi ltration and the solvents were removed by 
distillation under vacuum to afford the residues PALAH 
(37.5 g), PALAD (30.0 g) and PALAM (25.0 g). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The analysis of PALAH and PALAD by 1H and 
13C NMR spectra and TLC plate revealed the presence of 
a mixture of pentacyclic triterpenes (α-amyrin, β-amyrin 
and lupeol), those acetyl derivatives and a complex 
mixture of acyl-lupeol esters identifi ed previously 
(Carvalho et al., 2001; Sobrinho et al., 1991). The 
residue PALAM (15.0 g) was dissolved in methanol and 
submitted to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, 
eluted with methanol, to yield 40 fractions. The 1H and 
13C NMR spectra of fractions 18-21 (50.0 mg) collected 
from this column showed signals of glycopyranoside (1, 
identifi ed in the fractions 22-24) together with signals 
compatible with other phenylethanoid derivatives such 
as 1b, 2, 2a, and 3. The GC-MS analysis of this group 
of fractions afforded a chromatogram whose analysis 
of each corresponding mass spectrum considering 
the main peaks let us to identify 1b [4-hydroxy-4-(2-
hydroxyethyl)-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one; Rt: 4.36 min; 
m/z(%): 154 (100, M+.), 135 (30), 123 (25), 108 (20), 
certainly yielded from 1]; 2 [ethanol-2-(ciclohexyl-1-
hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-en-4-one; Rt: 2,33 min; m/z (%): 
186 (2, M+.), 155 (20), 137 (34), 112 (31), 110 (33), 82 
(100)] and 3 [4-hydroxyphenylethanol (tyrosol); Rt: 
2.43 min; m/z (%): 138 (40, M+.), 121 (17), 107 (100), 
94 (5), 77 (33)]. The absence of corresponding peak 
of 2a let us to propose to be a derivative from 2. The 
fraction 22-24 (gum, 2.0 g) was examined by IR, NMR 
spectra, including 2D-NMR experiments, besides mass 
spectrum and comparison with literature data (Khan et 
al., 1992) let to identify the quinol glucoside 1, known 
as cornoside (Jiménez and Riguera, 1994). 1 (50.0 mg) 
was treated with acetic anhydride and pyridine (1:1) at 
room temperature overnight, following usual work-up 
and fi ltration through a silica gel column, yielded the 
tetra-acetyl derivative 1a [m.p. 219-220 oC, 40.0 mg); 
1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz): 6.8 (d, 8.0 Hz, H-3,5), 6.2 
(d, 8.0Hz, H-2,6), 4.9-5.2 (m, 2’,3’,4’), 4.60 (d, 8Hz, 
H-1’) 4.0-4.3 (m, H-6’), 3,6 (m, H-5’); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 
50.3 MHz): 188.0 (C-1), 169.3-169.5 (OCOCH3), 147.8 
(CH-3,5), 128.6 (CH-2,6), 100.3 (CH-1’), 72.7 (CH-3’), 
71.8 (CH-5’), 71.1 (CH-2’), 68.4 (CH-4’), 63.9 (CH2-
8), 61.9 (C-4), 61.7 (CH2-6’), 39.0 (CH2-7), 24.1-24.7 
(OCOCH3)]. The analysis of 
1H and 13C NMR spectra of 
a solid material (300.00 mg), obtained from the fractions 
27-31, revealed the presence of carbohydrate (4). 30.0 
mg of 4 was acetylated by the same methodology used 
for 1 to obtain the derivative 4a. The analysis of IR and 
NMR spectra of 4a, besides comparison with the same 
penta-acetyl derivative of carbohydrate isolated from 
Himatanthus articulata (Barreto et al., 1998) and from

Ouratea hexasperma (Moreira et al., 1999), let us to 
identify 4 as methyl-myoinositol (mp 214-217 oC). The 
13C NMR spectrum of the remaing fractions was analyzed 
and revealed the presence of carbohydrates mixture. 
This is the fi rst record, in Apocynacae, of 1-3 which 
are widespread in families such as Cornacae, Oleacae, 
and Scrophulariacae (Kenichiro, 2005), Plantaginaceae 
(Jesen et al., 2005) and Bignoniaceae (Teshima et al., 
1996) (Figure 1).
