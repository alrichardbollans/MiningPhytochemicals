Um extrato metanólico das folhas de Luehea divaricata (Tiliaceae), vulgarmente conhecida no
Brasil como “açoita-cavalo”, forneceu um novo triterpeno caracterizado como ácido 3β-p-
hidroxibenzoiloxitormentico [ácido 3β-(p-hidroxibenzoiloxi)-2α-hidroxiurs-12-en-28-óico],
juntamente com uma mistura contendo o ácido maslínico, um triterpeno conhecido. As estruturas dos
compostos foram estabelecidas por métodos espectroscópicos.
A methanolic extract from leaves of Luehea divaricata (Tiliaceae), known in Brazil as “açoita-
cavalo”, yielded two triterpene: a novel characterized as 3β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxytormentic acid
[3β-(p-hydroxybenzoyloxy)-2α-hydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid] and a mixture containing the maslinic
acid. The new compound’s structure was established by spectroscopic methods.
Keywords: Luehea divaricata, 3β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxytormentic acid, maslinic acid
Introduction
The Tiliaceae family has not been extensively studied
yet.  α-Amyrin derivatives have already been isolated from
the genus Corchorus.1 There is no studies about the
chemical composition of this plant and no reports were
found on the genus Luehea as well. Luehea divaricata
Mart. (Tiliaceae), known in Brazil as “açoita-cavalo”, is a
tree which grows in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.2, 3 The
L. divaricata is used in Brazilian folk medicine for different
purposes: the leaves are used as diuretic, the stems as anti-
inflammatory,4 the bark and aerial parts are used for healing
skin wounds, pimples, and for vaginal washes.2 Also the L.
divaricata was assayed for antifungal properties and
exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against
dermatophytes.2 The aqueous extract of L. divaricata
presented genotoxic activity in the Ames test (Salmonella/
microsome) with microsomal activation.5 However, a
phytochemical screening of L.divaricata reported the
presence of flavonoids, tannins and saponins.4 In this paper
we report the isolation and the structure elucidation of a
new α-amyrin derivative, which was characterized as 3β-
p-hydroxybenzoyloxytormentic acid and a mixture
containing the maslinic acid.
Results and Discussion
Structural elucidation and NMR signal assignments of
3β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxytormentic acid (1)
Compound 1 was isolated as white crystals. Its EIMS
spectrum showed a molecular peak at m/z 608 in agreement
with C37H52O7 molecular formula. It also showed a base
peak at m/z 121 attributed to p-hydroxybenzoyl cation
and also the peaks at m/z 563 (10.8%, [M - COOH]+) and
562 (17.0%, [M- HCOOH]+ • ). The peak at m/z 146 (61.9%,
[C11H14]+ •) is a characteristic of a tertiary hydroxyl function
presence at C-19 in the urs-12-ene skeleton.6 Other
important peaks were noticed at m/z 246 (14.0%), 219
(7.9%), 218 (14.0%) and 201 (5.8%). Some low relative
abundance peaks at          m/z 179 and 264 were detected, as
previously related to triterpenes from ursane class.6 The 1H
chemical shifts of 1 (CD3OD), in the range of δ 0.82-1.37,
showed six singlets from methyl groups and one doublet,
partly superposed by the singlets in agreement with an
ursane type compound. The 1H NMR spectrum of an
oleanane type compound has seven methyl singlets and
no doublets.7 The 1H NMR spectrum also showed two
carbinolic methine hydrogens at δ 3.90 (td, J 10.3 Hz,
10.3 Hz, 4.0 Hz, H-2β) and 4.70 ppm (d, J 10.3 Hz, H-3α)
and one olefinic hydrogen at δ 5.30 (br s, H-12). These
data suggested 1 to be a triterpene with an ursane skeleton.
The 1H NMR spectral data were compared to those from
476 Tanaka et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
tormentic acid,8 and a strong agreement was observed, ex-
cept the chemical shift corresponding to H-3. The differ-
ence (∆
δH = 1.79 ppm) of the H-3 chemical shift (δH 4.70) in
respect to tormentic acid8 was justified by the presence of a
p-hydroxybenzoyl group linked to the oxygen of C-3 in
compound 1, which induces an electron density reduction
by inductive and resonance withdrawal effects of the p-
hydroxybenzoyloxy group. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra’s
compound had signals for a p-hydroxybenzoate group [δ
7.92 (2H, dd, J 9.0 Hz, 2.1 Hz) and δ 6.83 (2H, dd, J 9.0 Hz,
2.1 Hz), δ 168.7 (C-7’), 163.6, (C-4’), 133.0 (CH-2’ and CH-
6’), 123.0 (C-1’), 116.2 (CH-3’ and CH-5’)]. The presence of
this group was supported by the observation of a strong
peak in the mass spectrum at m/z 121 corresponding to
[C7H5O2] + •. The correlation between H-3 and C-7’ observed
in HMBC spectrum was very important because it was pos-
sible to establish a link between the p-hydroxybenzoyl group
and the triterpene skeleton from the structure 1 in the C-3
position. Initially, compound 1 13C NMR spectrum was run
in CD3OD, however it was also necessary to run in C5D5N to
confirm the presence of the signals that were superposed by
the solvent signal in the range of δ 48-50 (Table 1). The 13C
NMR spectrum of 1 confirmed that is a triterpene skeleton
with an ursolic acid type (C-12 and C-13 at δ 129.3 and
140.4). The 13C NMR spectral data of 1 were compared with
those from tormentic acid ester glucoside.9 The coupling
constant (J2,3) of 10.3 Hz is typical to an antiperiplanar (axial-
axial) relationship between H-2 and H-3 (Table 1). The NOE
difference NMR experiment was also performed to confirm
the p-hydroxybenzoyloxy group orientation at C-3. Irra-
diation of H-2β signal at δ 3.90 produced an enhancement
in the methyl hydrogens resonance at δ 1.01 (3H-24) and
1.08 (3H-25) which showed a coaxial relationship between
3H-24 and 3H-25. In the same irradiation, it wasn’t observed
NOE enhancement at H-3 or H-5, showing an antiperiplanar
relationship between H-2 / H-3 and H-2 / H-5.
The complete and unequivocal 1H and 13C chemical
shifts assignments of 1 were assisted by DEPT, COSY (1H x
1H), HSQC (13C x 1H) and HMBC (13C x 1H) spectra (Table 1).
Assignments of maslinic acid (2)
The 1D 1H NMR from the mixture showed signals for
methyl groups (δ 0.80–1.16), for two carbinolic methine
hydrogens at δ 2.90 (d, J 9.9Hz, H-3α) and 3.61 (ddd, J
9.9 Hz, 9.9 Hz, 3.9 Hz, H-2β) and for one olefinic hydrogen
at δ 5.24 (t, J 3.6 Hz). These data suggested 2 to be a
triterpene with an oleanane skeleton.8 The 13C NMR
spectrum showed the signals at δ 145.5, 123.6, 84.5 and
69.5 confirming that is olean-12-ene-2α, 3β -diol.10 Some
aspects of the maslinic acid structure was made by
comparison of its 1H NMR and 13C NMR data with those
proposed to a similar compound.8,10,11
Experimental

MHz) NMR spectra were obtained in pyridine-d5 or methanol-

477A New Tormentic Acid Derivative from Luehea divaricata Mart. (Tiliaceae)Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003
Plant material
The plant was collected in April 1999, Mandacaru
stream, Maringá city, State of Paraná, Brazil and identified
by Dr. Maria Conceição de Souza, Universidade Estadual
de Maringá. A voucher specimen (HUM 9057) was kept at
the herbarium of the Biological Department of
Universidade Estadual de Maringá.
Isolation
Air-dried and powdered leaves (600 g) of L. divaricata
Mart., were extracted with MeOH at room temp. The MeOH
extract was concentrated in vacuum and yielded 74 g of
crude methanolic extract. Part of the crude methanolic
extract (38 g) was partitioned with n-hexane (600 mL),
chloroform (600 mL), ethyl acetate (600 mL) and methanol
(100 mL), yielding 5.8 g (15.3%), 2.9 g (7.6%), 4.9 g
(12.9%), 24 g (63.2%) respectively. The choroformic
fraction was subjected to CC on silica gel (70 g) and eluted
with different rations of n-hexane, CHCl3 and MeOH. The
appropriate frs (monitored by TLC analysis) were
combined resulting in 22 frs. Fr 14 (160 mg), eluted with
chloroform-methanol (90:10), was subjected to repeated
CC on silica gel, eluted with n-hexane, chloroform and
methanol mixts of increasing polarity to give 3β-p-
hydroxybenzoyloxytormentic acid (1) (2.8 mg-1.8%) and
a mixture containing maslinic acid (2) (4.3 mg-2.7%).
