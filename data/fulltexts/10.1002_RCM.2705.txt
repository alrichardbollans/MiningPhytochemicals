Contract/
Trust FunFructus Evodiae (Wuzhuyu), the fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa and related varieties, is widely used in
traditional Chinese medicine. The bioactive constituents include the indoloquinazoline alkaloids
rutaecarpine, evodiamine and dehydroevodiamine. A new assay based on high-performance
liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(HPLC/UV/APCI-MS/MS) was developed for themeasurement of the indoloquinazoline alkaloids
in commercial Fructus Evodiae products. Initially, the MS/MS fragmentation pathways of indo-
loquinazoline alkaloids were investigated to identify fragment ions that might be useful for the
sensitive and selective detection of trace indoloquinazoline alkaloids during LC/MS/MS. Then,
quantitative MS analysis of five indoloquinazoline alkaloids in 12 commercial Fructus Evodiae
products from different geographical sources was performed. Analyte recovery was in the range of
97.5–105.3% for all with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 6%, the intra-assay and inter-
assay RSDs were less than 7%, and good linear relationships were shown with correlation
coefficients for the analytes exceeding 0.999. Therefore, this LC/MS/MS assay facilitated the rapid
quantitative analysis of rutaecarpine, evodiamine, evodiamide, 14-formyldihydrorutaecarpine
and dehydroevodiamine in 12 commercial Fructus Evodiae products with excellent recovery,
repeatability, accuracy and sensitivity. This method is simple and specific and can be used for
identification and quality control of this traditional Chinese remedy. Copyright# 2006 JohnWiley
& Sons, Ltd.Fructus Evodiae, calledWuzhuyu in Chinese, is a commonly
used traditional Chinese medicinal herb. According to the
Chinese Pharmacopoeia, it is derived from the dried
immature fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth., Evodia
rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. officinalis (Dode) Huang and
Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. var. bodinieri (Dode) Huang.1
These three taxa have been transferred to the genus Tetradium
as a single species T. ruticarpum.2 This herb has long been
used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, head-

method for analyzing Fructus Evodiae samples. However,
the complex composition of this herb interferes and
challenges the sensitivity and selectivity of the HPLC/UV
approach. For example, the indoloquinazoline alkaloids
might interfere with the detection of other trace amounts of
co-eluting compounds.50 LC/MS or LC/MSn methods are
alternatives that may be considered.
LC/MS does not require sample derivatization prior to
analysis as compared with GC/MS. Furthermore, the
selectivity of mass-selective detection minimizes the
need for complete chromatographic resolution of analytes
and matrix compounds. Recently, two HPLC/electrospray
ionization (ESI)-MS/MS methods were reported. One of
them was only used for the separation and detection of five
alkaloids, and the quantitative determination of rutaecarpine
in E. rutaecarpa.50 The other report used selective ion
recording (SIR) for the detection of alkaloids in some
Chinese herbal preparations.51 In the present study, a highly
sensitive and selective assay based on HPLC/atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI)-MS/MS was
developed for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of five
indolequinazoline alkaloids, namely rutaecarpine, evodia-
mine, evodiamide, 14-formyldihydrorutaecarpine and dehy-
droevodiamine in 12 commercial Fructus Evodiae samples.
The LC/MS fingerprint of the representative samples could
be used for quality assessment of the commercial Fructus
Evodiae products. The application of this method was also
employed for differentiation of E. rutaecarpa from the
adulterant Evodia meliaefolia (¼Tetradium glabrifolium).EXPERIMENTAL
Reagents and chemicals
HPLC-grade acetonitrile (Tedia, USA) was used for HPLC
analysis. Water prepared with a Millipore Milli-Q SP water
purification system (Millipore, France) was used during
sample preparation procedures and HPLC analyses.
Extraction and isolation
Dried fruits (2.3 kg) were milled and extracted with alcohol
(4 6.0 L) under reflux at 608C for 3 h. The alcoholic extracts
were filtered and concentrated to a syrup, which was
suitably diluted with H2O, and sequentially partitioned with
petroleum ether and EtOAc. The EtOAc layer was evapor-
ated in vacuo to a residue (206 g), adsorbed on 400 g of silica
gel and chromatographed on a column pre-packed with
600 g of silica gel. Gradient elution was accomplished with
CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:0, 19:1, 9:1, 4:1, 0:1), which gave 30
fractions. Compounds 1 and 2were crystallized as a mixture
from fractions 1–3, and were further separated by column
chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3 to afford the
pure 1 and 2, respectively. In the same manner, another
mixture (compounds 3 and 4), crystallized from fractions
6–7, provided the pure 3 and 4, respectively. Compound
5 was crystallized from fraction 13, which was purified
through repeated re-crystallization in CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) to
yield the pure 5. Compound 6 was directly crystallized as
pure fine yellow needles from fraction 24.Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Compounds 1–6 (Fig. 1) were identified based on spectral
(NMR andMS) analyses, and, in the case of 2 and 5, by X-ray
diffraction. These compounds were chosen as chemical
markers, which showed high purity of over 98% by LC
analysis.
Collection of samples
A total of 12 samples from the commercial samples of
E. rutaecarpa and E. rutaecarpa var. officinalis were collected
from different places in China (Table 1). These samples were
identified carefully based on morphological characteristics
and molecular markers (ITS1 and ITS2 DNA sequences).
Voucher samples were deposited in the Museum of Institute
of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Preparation of standard solutions and samples
A small amount of the powder of Fructus Evodiae was
accurately weighed to 0.3 g and placed into a 10-mL test tube;
each weighed sample was extracted with 3mL methanol by
sonication for 1 h at room temperature, and then diluted to
10mLwith methanol in a volumetric flask. Then the solution
was filtered through a 0.22mm PTFE syringe filter, and an
aliquot of each filtrate (2mL) was injected in the LC/MS
system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) for analysis.
The reference compounds 1–5were weighed to the nearest
1mg and dissolved in methanol in a 10-mL volumetric flask
to make a stock solution (1.00, 1.12, 0.88, 0.62, 0.76mg/mL,
respectively). All working standard solutions for calibration
curves were prepared by diluting the stock solutions using
methanol.
External standard least-squares linear regression, with at
least six concentration points, was used for quantification.
Calibration curves for the five standards were made at
different concentration ranges and tested using two detec-
tion signals: UV andMS-selected reaction monitoring (SRM),
and response with correlation values of at least 0.999.
Linearity was assessed using the response factor and the
regression coefficient (g2) separately. The response factor
(RF) is calculated using the equation: RF¼DR/C, where DR
is the detector response, in area counts, and C is the
concentration of the analyte injected.
The precision of the chromatographic determination for
the proposed method, expressed as a relative standard
deviation (RSD), was calculated by six replicate injections of
sample 1 (intra-day and inter-day). The standard solutions
used for repeatability experiments were the same as for the
calibration curve experiment.
For percent recovery, three sets of methanolic extracts of
Fructus Evodiae samples were prepared from sample 12.
Three different concentrations of the standard compounds
1 (10, 20 and 40mg/mL), 2 (11.2, 22.4 and 44.8mg/mL), 3 (8.8,
17.6 and 35.2mg/mL), 4 (6.2, 12.4 and 24.8mg/mL), and 5
(7.6, 15.2 and 30.4mg/mL) were prepared. These three sets
were then individually spiked with 1mL of each standard
from all the three spiking concentrations. The samples, to
which standards were added, were pretreated and analyzed
using the developed LC/MS method. Volumes of 10mL of
each concentration were injected into the LC system to
measure the percentage recovery.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 3111–3118

Analyses of indoloquinazoline alkaloids in Fructus Evodiae 3113HPLC conditions
Analytical HPLC was performed on an Agilent HP 1100
HPLC instrument system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
equipped with a G1322 degasser, a G1312A Quarpump, a
G1328 VWD detector and a G1313A autosampler. The
separation for LC/MS/MS was achieved using an Altima
C18 column (150 2.1mm, 3mm; Alltech Associates, USA) at
room temperature. The mobile phase was comprised of
CH3CN/water/tetrahydrofuran/acetic acid (45:54:1:0.1), at
a flow rate of 0.2mL/min, and UV detection at 270 nm.
Mass spectrometry
Mass spectra were obtained using a TSQ 7000 quadrupole
mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA, USA)
equippedwith anAPCI source operated in positive/negative
ion mode. The mass spectrometric conditions were as
follows: capillary temperature 2008C; spray voltage 4.5 kV;
capillary voltage fixed at 13.0V; full scan (m/z 100–800) using
500ms for collection time; evaporation temperature 4508C;
corona discharged current was set at 4.0mA; sheath gas flow
60 arbitrary units of nitrogen; aux gas flow 10 arbitrary units
of nitrogen. The analytes were detected in positive mode by
monitoring the precursor-product in combination with
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, with the opti-
mized relative collision energies of 30–50%. The precursor
ion isolation window was set at 1 Th to maximize signal/
noise (S/N) in the fragment ion spectra; the scan range was
m/z 100–800, and the scan cycle time 500ms.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 3111–3118

Fragmentation behavior of indolequinazoline
alkaloids from Fructus Evodiae
In this study, both LC/APCI-MS and LC/APCI-MS/MS in
positive and negative ion modes were used to study the
alkaloids isolated from Fructus Evodiae. LC/APCI-MS was
found to be better than LC/ESI-MS in positive ion mode.
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit strong signals in both ESI and
APCI spectra, but the intensity of signals of compounds
3 and 4 in APCI-MS are stronger than those in ESI-MS.
Therefore, LC/APCI-MS was used for qualitative and
quantitative determination of the alkaloids. Prior to LC/
APCI-MS analysis of the real samples, the instrumental
parameters (sheath gas flow rate, ionspray voltage, capillary
temperature, capillary voltage, lens voltage) were optimized
for maximum abundance of the ions of interest by loop
injection of standard compounds.
In order to provide a valid basis for characterization of the
structures of trace constituents in the crude extracts by LC/
MS, the mass spectrometric behavior of five pure alkaloids
isolated from Fructus Evodiae extract were examined in
detail by APCI-MS/MS in positive mode; the [MþH]þ ions
and main product ions of these compounds are listed in
Table 2. The fragmentation of this class of alkaloids was
found to be similar, following these general trends.
The abundant protonated molecular ions [MþH]þ were
found in the APCI-MS spectra for all alkaloids. The observed
characteristic fragment ions in tandem mass spectra, namely
[MþH–CH4]þ, [MþH–CH3–NH2]þ, [MþH–CO]þ and
[MþH–H2O]þ, provide further evidence on their chemical
structures. Compound 2 was representative of these
alkaloids; its MS spectrum showed a strong protonated
molecular ion [MþH]þ at m/z 304, and the characteristic
fragment corresponding to [MþH–CH4]þ atm/z 288, [MþH–
CH3–NH2]
þ at m/z 273, [MþH–133]þ at m/z 171, and [MþH–
143]þ at m/z 161 were noted in the MS/MS spectrum
(supporting information), and the possible fragmentation
pathway is proposed in Fig. 2.
Validation of HPLC/MS method
Chromatograms of all five reference standards generated by
MS detection are presented in Fig. 3 (STD). Baseline
separation of these reference standards was obtained by
UV detection at 270 nm and MS detection in positive mode.Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.These reference standards were successfully determined by a
single run of HPLC, and their average retention times were
7.6min (compound 5), 14.2min (compound 4), 19.2min
(compound 3), 23.6min (compound 2), and 30.2min
(compound 1), respectively. Variation in the retention times
for the alkaloids in Fig. 3 was partly caused by the changes in
room temperature.
The analytes were determined in positive mode by
monitoring the precursor-product ions in SRM mode. For
compound 1, major fragment ions in the MS2 spectrum
corresponding to [M]þ and [MþH–CH4]þ at m/z 287 and 273
were found. Since the intensity and sensitivity of m/z 287
were higher than m/z 273, after optimization, the detection
channel was changed fromm/z 288 tom/z 287. For compound
2, the MS2 spectrum showed the key characteristic fragment
[MþH–CH4]þ at m/z 288; this ion was chosen for optimiz-
ation of mass spectrometric parameters. Similarly, detection
channelsm/z 308! 290 for evodiamide (3),m/z 318! 302 for
14-formyldihydrorutaecarpine (4), and m/z 302! 287 for
dehydroevodiamine (5) were chosen for SRM detection,
respectively.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 3111–3118

samples of the fruits of Fructus Evodiae (samples 1–12), a sample of Evodia

TIC chromatograms refer to positive ionization in APCI mode, and compound
identities were assigned on the basis of MS/MS analyses.
Analyses of indoloquinazoline alkaloids in Fructus Evodiae 3115The limits of detection (S/N 3) of all five reference
standards by UV detection ranged from 14–50 ng. On the
other hand, it is not surprising that the MS detection showed
a better sensitivity for the detection of these compounds with
lower measurable quantities of 25–60 pg. This sensitivity is
acceptable for the detection of trace amounts of alkaloids in
the tested samples.
The linearity of the plot concentrations (X, mg/mL) for
compounds 1–5 versus peak areas (Y) was investigated. Both
the UV and MS detectors were used, so UV and MS-SRM
signals were available for the quantification of compounds
(Table 3). Two parameters were used to assess linearity:
regression coefficient (g2) and response factor. In most cases,
g2 is an acceptable means of evaluating linearity for
regression. However, problems can arise with g2 values at
low or high calibration concentrations where deviations from
linearity and confidence intervals increase and are especiallyTable 3. Linear calibration information and data for compounds 1

orders of magnitude.54 A more accurate and sensitive
method of quantifying linearity is to use response factors,
which are not susceptible to the potential problem of g2.54,55
Ideally, the response factor values should be equal through
the calibration range, thus lower % RSD of response factor
equals better linearity.
The analytical precision from the data of the intra-day (five
times per day) and inter-day (twice a day for three consecu-
tive days) determinations was indicated by the relative
standard deviations (RSDs), which were below 6.6% (Table 4).
The repeatability of the method was evaluated by
analyzing the contents of compounds 1 and 2 in six
independently prepared samples of Fructus Evodiae with
RSD (%) <0.9%. The percent recoveries of the six standards
ranged between 97.5 to 105.3%, with the recovery RSD below

in 12 commercial products using this new LC/MS/MS assay
with both UV and MS detectors. There is no difference
between the UV andMS detection to quantify the contents of
compounds 1, 2 and 5, but trace amounts of compounds 3
and 4 could not be quantified by the former. Peaks 4 and 7
were overlapping in the chromatograms, and the quantified
contents for compound 4might be compromised throughUV
detection. Thus, MS detection fares much better for
quantification of compounds in a mixture.able 6. Contents (%) of five alkaloids in the 12 collected commercial materials of Fructus Evodiae by MS-SRM detection

1Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The contents of the alkaloids in the 12 samples were found
to be variable. The calculated percentages of compounds 1–5
in the 12 commercial samples were in the ranges of 0.061–
0.550, 0.039–1.623, 0.0037–0.455, 0.024–0.065, 0.122–0.863 and
0.0069–0.741, respectively. In general, the percentage of
evodiamine (2) was the highest, followed by dehydroevo-
diamine (5), rutaecarpine (1), evodiamide (3), and 14-
formyldihydrorutaecarpin (4), in all the samples, as clearly
evident from Table 6. With reference to the Chinese
Pharmacopoeia, the total contents of 1 and 2 in qualified
Fructus Evodiae samples should reach at least 0.15%Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 3111–3118

Analyses of indoloquinazoline alkaloids in Fructus Evodiae 3117(1.5mg/g). In our study, all samples except 2, 4, 9 and 12
contained more than 1.5mg/g of 1 and 2.
It has been reported that the constituent contents could
vary with the degrees of maturity of the fruits.45 Further-
more, commercial Fructus Evoidae may be different due to
differences in cultivation areas and storage conditions. Thus
chemical examination is necessary before clinical application
because of its large variation.
Chemical profiles of Fructus Evodiae
Figure 3 shows the HPLC/APCI-MS chromatograms of the
12 samples. The results show that their chromatograms are
similar although the contents of the characteristic com-
pounds vary. Peaks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were detected in all 12
extracts. Peaks 4 and 7 seemed to be mutually exclusive in
these samples, for both of them could be found in the
extracts. Peak 7 was absent in samples of 1, 5, 6 and 7. Peak 4
was missing in some samples. Trace amount of peak 8 could
be detected in samples 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9.
HPLC coupled with APCI-MS/MS was employed to
analyze the components in the Fructus Evodiae crude extracts.
A total of eight characteristic peaks were detected in the
chromatograms. Standards were available for rutaecarpine
(1), evodiamine (2), evodiamide (3), 14-formyldihydrorutae-
carpine (4), dehydroevodiamine (5) and isorhamnetin-3-O-b-
D-galactoside (6). The identities of the peaks representing
these compounds were confirmed by matching the MS/MS
fragmentation patterns and retention times in the extractswith
those of the standards. Owing to the unavailability of
authentic compounds, two other components included in
the chromatograms were tentatively assigned, by comparing
their APCI-MS and UV spectra in the literature. For peak 7, a
protonatedmolecular ion [MþH]þ atm/z 471 in positivemode
was intense whilst the negative ion [M–H] at m/z 469 was
relatively weak, which suggested its molecular weight is 470.
The positive fragment ions at m/z 453 [MþH–H2O]þ, 412
½MþHCO2CH3 þ, 396 [MþH–CH3–CO–CH3–OH]þ and
354 ½MþHCO2CH3COCH3CH3 þ were observed
in the MS/MS spectrum; together with its UV absorption
maximum at 210nm, it could be tentatively deduced to be
limonin (7).52,53 For peak 8, fragments corresponding to
[MþH–CH4]þ and [MþH–CO]þ at m/z 290 and 278 were
observed in the MS/MS spectrum, respectively, which
showed a fragmentation pattern similar to those of 2. By
comparison with the reference, compound 8 was tentatively
deduced to be goshuyuanamide-I.50 The retention times (Rt),
molecular ions [MþH]þ, andMS2 product ions of compounds
1–8 are listed in Table 2. Structures of the eight compounds are
shown in Fig. 1.
This HPLC/MS method can also be used to differentiate
Fructus Evodiae (E. rutaecarpa and E. rutaecarpa var.
officinalis) samples from Evodia meliaefolia by either their
chromatographic patterns or characteristic compounds.
Some components are commonly found in both species,
such as compounds 1–3 and 7. However, peaks 4, 5, 6 and 8
were not detected in E. meliaefolia. The amounts of
compounds 1 (0.14mg/g) and 2 (0.23mg/g) in E. meliaefolia
were significantly lower than those in samples of Fructus
Evodiae.Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.CONCLUSIONS
A quantitative assay was developed based on LC/MS/MS
for the analysis of pharmacologically active indoloquinazo-
line alkaloids in commercial Fructus Evodiae samples. Using
this assay, rutaecarpine, evodiamine, evodiamide, 14-for-
myldihydrorutaecarpine and dehydroevodiamine could be
measured with high precision, accuracy and sensitivity.
Additionally, MS facilitated the determination of two other
components by comparing their APCI-MS and UV spectra
with those previously reported. The LC/MS fingerprints of
these alkaloids, though variable among samples, could
provide an overall characterization of the authenticity and
quality of this species and help to differentiate it from other
adulterants.Acknowledgements
