Sete compostos foram isolados, a partir das frações solúveis em CHCl3, de raízes de Pituranthos
tortuosos; adicionalmente manitol foi cristalizado a partir do extrato alcoólico. Usando diferentes
técnicas espectroscópicas os compostos isolados foram identificados como bergaptana, graveolana,
xanthotoxinona, isopimpinela, dimetoxi aesculetina, 3-O-β-glicopiranosil estigmasterol e também o
novo éster umbelato de 4-metoxifenila. A estrutura do novo éster foi confirmada pela síntese completa
e se mostrou inativo a testes antimicrobiais e de citotoxicidade.
Seven compounds were isolated from the CHCl3 soluble fraction of the roots of Pituranthos
tortuosus; in addition, mannitol was crystallized out of the total alcoholic extract. Using different
spectroscopic techniques, the isolated compounds were identified as bergapten, graveolone,
xanthotoxin, isopimpinellin, aesculetin dimethyl ether, stigmasterol glucoside, in addition to the new
ester 4-methoxyphenylumbellate. The structure of the new ester was confirmed by total synthesis
and it was found to be inactive in antimicrobial and cytotoxicity assays.

Introduction
Members of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) are well
known producers of furanocoumarins. In this regard,
Apiaceae is in the first place followed by Rutaceae and
Moraceae.1 Furanocoumarins have several interesting
biological activities, such as analgesic, antiinflammatory,
antibacterial, antiviral, anticoagulant, in addition to their
well known photosensitizing effect.2-8 In Egypt, the genus
Pituranthos (Deverra) is represented by two species.9 While
five furanocoumarins were isolated from P. triradiatus, the
aerial parts of P. tortuosus was found to be free from these
compounds.10 This result intiated the study of the plant
roots for the presence of furanocoumarins since they are
taxonomic markers for the family.
Results and Discussions
Spectral data indicated that compounds 1 and 3 are
furanocoumarins with a methoxyl group at either C-5 or
C-8. The position of the methoxyl was assigned based on
comparison of the 13C-NMR data with those in the
literature11. The negative CIMS data of 1 (bergapten)
showed a base peak at m/z 201 resulting from the fission of
the aromatic ether bond indicating a 1, 3, 5 oxygenation
of the aromatic ring which stabilizes the resulting
phenoxide anion.12 That ion in 3 (xanthotoxin) was of
very low intensity indicating C-8 oxygenation.
Compounds 2, 4 and 5 were identified as graveolone,13- 15
isopimpinellin16 and aesculetin dimethyl ether,17 respectively,
by comparison of their data with those of the literature.
However, the 13C-NMR data for the linear dihydro-
benzodipyrandione; graveolone (2) is reported here for the
first time. Graveolone is a compound of very limited occurrence
and has only been isolated from dill and parsley.13, 16
Compound 6 gives a positive reaction with FeCl3
indicating the presence of free phenolic OH group(s). In
the 1H-NMR (Table 1), the ABX system (6.33, dd, J 2.2, 9.0
Hz; 6.31, d, J 2.2 Hz; 7.38, d, J 9.0 Hz) was assigned for a
trisubstituted aromatic system. The chemical shifts of the
protons and carbons supported a 1, 2, 4-trisubstitution
with two oxygenations at 2, 4 rather than 1, 3, 4-
trisubstitutions.18- 21 Two other doublets (J 16.0 Hz) each
integrated for 1 proton at δ 6.58 and 8.03 with their
correlated carbons (Table 1) were assigned to trans oriented
conjugated vinyl protons. The substituted aromatic system
along with the vinyl protons as well as the carbonyl signal
at 167.91 ppm in the 13C-NMR (Table 1) were assigned for
a 2, 4-dioxygenated cinnamate moiety.

Both EIMS (M+ at m/z 286) and CIMS (M++1 at m/z
287) (see experimental) were consistent with the molecular
formula C16H14O5. Fourteen carbon signals were observed
in the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 1). However, two of these
signals (114.18 and 122.41 ppm) correlated by an HMQC
experiment to two doublets at δ 6.92 (2H, J 8.8 Hz) and
7.03 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz) were assigned for a p-dioxygenated
benzene ring. The position of the OCH3 (δ 3.77, 54.85
ppm in 1H- and 13C-NMR respectively) at C-4’ was
determined by a GOESY experiment where irradiation of
the OCH3 signal resulted in an enhancement in the doublet
at δ 6.92 (2H, J 8.8 Hz).
The above discussion indicated that 6 is an ester of
umbellic acid (2, 4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid) with 4-
methoxyphenol.
As final proof, 6 was obtained by total synthesis (Figure
1). The commercially available umbelliferone (Aldrich)
was treated with 5% alcoholic solution of NaOH to open
the lactone ring. This reaction resulted in the formation of
umbellic acid (2, 4-dihydroxy trans-cinnamic acid) 7
which was protected by TBDMSCl to give 7a. Protected
umbellic acid 7a was then coupled with 4-methoxyphenol
to produce 6a. Deprotection of 6a gave 6. Umbellic acid is
a possible precursor for umbelliferone which is the key
compound in the biosynthesis of furanocoumarins.22 The
isolation of compounds 1- 6 from the roots of P. tortuosus
indicated that its biosynthetic pathway is consistent with
those in other members of the family Apiaceae.
Compound 6 was inactive when tested against A2780
(Human Ovarian cancer cell), Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus albus and Candida albicans.
Experimental
General procedure
Melting points were determined using Kofler,s hot stage
instrument and are uncorrected. UV spectra were
determined using UV-1201 Shimadzu spectrometer. NMR
spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 NMR
instrument at 399.951 MHz for 1H and 100.578 MHz for
13C. MS were taken on a VG 7070 E-HF. All chemicals
used in the synthesis of 6 were obtained from Aldrich
Chemicals Company.

Plant material
Roots of Pituranthos tortuosus (Desf.) Benth. were
collected on April 3, 2000 from Borg El-Arab, Alexandria,
Egypt. The plant was identified by Dr Sanyia Kamal,
Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, University of
Alexandria. A voucher specimen MS-7 is deposited in the
Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy,
University of Alexandria, Egypt.
Extraction and isolation
1.2 kg of the dried roots was extracted with MeOH (6L).
The methanolic extract was concentrated to 200 mL. At that
point 400 mg of colourless crystals of mannitol were separated
out of the solution. The concentrated methanolic solution
was diluted with water to 300 mL and extracted exhaustively
with hexane (700 mL), CHCl3 (700mL) and EtOAc (500 mL).
The CHCl3 soluble fraction (3 g) was fractionated over silica
gel column (200 g, 3 cm) eluting with 1% MeOH in CHCl3,
with gradual increasing of the MeOH contents and 200 mL
fractions were collected. Fractions 2- 4 (1% MeOH, 1.0 g)
were rechromatographed over silica gel column (100 g, 2.5
cm) eluting with 25% hexane in CHCl3, CHCl3/ hexane and
then CHCl3/MeOH mixtures. Fraction 2 (50% hexane in
CHCl3, 150 mg) was subjected to repeated prep TLC using
hexane/CHCl3 (2: 1) as developing system (triple run) to afford
1 (8 mg), 2 (5 mg), 3 (14 mg), 4 (6 mg) and 5 (4 mg).
Fraction 5 (2% MeOH, 100 mg) was further purified
over flash silica gel column (30 g, 2.5 cm) eluting with 1%
MeOH in CHCl3. Fraction 3 (7 mg) was subjected to prep
TLC over RP18 and MeOH/ H2O (7: 3) as developing
system to afford 2 mg of 6.
Fraction 9 afforded 50 mg of stigmasterol glucoside
after crystallization from MeOH.

Synthesis of 4-Methoxyphenylumbellate (6)
Preparation of Umbellic acid (7). 1 gm of umbelliferone
(Aldrich) was dissolved in 100mL MeOH and stirred with
an equal volume of 5% alcoholic KOH for 4 h. The reaction
mixture was neutralized with diluted HCl and then extracted
with EtOAc (500 mL). The residue left after evaporation of
the solvent was purified over silica gel column (100 g, 3
cm) eluting with CHCl3 and CHCl3/MeOH mixtures. 455
mg of umbelliferone were recovered in the early fractions.
Fractions 5- 11 eluted with 2% MeOH in CHCl3 afforded

mmol) and tert-butyldimethylsilylchloride (TBSCl) (810 mg,
5.4 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for
15 min under argon, quenched with NaHCO3, and stirring
was continued for 5 min. The resulted solution was extracted
with 300 mL EtOAc. The organic layer was washed twice
with H2O, brine solution, then H2O again and finally dried
over Na2SO4. Part of the residue left after evaporation of the
EtOAc (7a) was checked by 1H-NMR and the rest was dried
for the next step. UV λ
