Sneezing and nose rubbing events in mice given a date extract-added diet were 4 significantly lower than in those given an extract-free (control) diet. The serum total and 5 mite antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, and the number of spleen 6 interleukin-4+CD4+, IgE+B220+ and FcεRIα+CD117+ cells was significantly lower in 7 mice given the date extract-added diet than in those given the control diet. Chlorogenic 8 acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid significantly reduced the number of IgE+B220+ cells, 9 while chlorogenic acid and pelargonin significantly decreased the number of 10 FcεRIα+CD117+ cells in mouse spleen cell cultures. These results suggest that some 11 polyphenols in the date may reduce mite-induced allergic symptoms in mice via a 12 decrease in the number of IgE-producing plasma cells and high-affinity IgE 13 receptor-expressing mast cells. 14 Key words: anti-allergic property, date polyphenol, Th1/Th2 balance, IgE-producing 15 plasma cell, mast cell16 3  Introduction 1 Type I allergy is caused by an inappropriate reaction against food and environmental 2 allergens. The prevalence and severity of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, 3 allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis have increased dramatically during the past decade 4 around the world, especially in developed countries. The allergies characterized by these 5 symptoms are generally caused by degranulation that occurs following antigen 6 cross-linking of immunoglobulin (Ig) E molecules on mast cells (1). Thus, IgE is 7 essential for type I allergic reactions. It is established that interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and 8 IL-13, which are produced by type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, stimulate IgE production (1). 9 In particular, IL-4 is known to play a crucial role in IgE synthesis (2). In contrast, type 1 10 helper T (Th1) cells mainly secrete interferon (IFN)-γ, which inhibits IL-4 production 11 by the Th2 cells (3, 4). As a result, a strict balance between Th1 and Th2 activity is 12 essential for the control of IgE production. 13 It has been demonstrated in recent years that some fruit extracts reduce allergic 14 symptoms. Kim et al. reported that a water-soluble extract prepared from Actinidia 15 arguta improved asthmatic symptoms via the down-regulation of IgE in mouse (5). Lee 16 et al. found that resveratrol, which has been identified in various fruit and vegetable 17 extracts, inhibited Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, and suppressed airway 18 hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilia, and mucus hypersecretion in the asthmatic mouse 19 model (6). 20 More recently, our group observed that the ratio of Th1/Th2 cells in the spleen and 21 4  Peyer’s patch was higher in C3H/HeN mice given a diet containing a hot water extract 1 of the matured fruit of the date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera L.) than in mice given an 2 extract-free diet (7), due to an increase in the number of spleen and Peyer’s patch Th1 3 cells and a tendency for the number of Th2 cells to decrease. These results suggested 4 that a date extract might have a suppressive effect on allergic immune responses via the 5 adjustment of Th1/Th2 balance. 6 This study therefore evaluated the effect of a date extract on the allergic responses 7 induced by a mite (Dermatophagoides farinae, Df) allergen in BALB/c mice, and 8 determined whether date polyphenols affect allergy-associated effector cells in 9 C3H/HeN mouse spleen cell cultures. 10  11 Materials and Methods 12 Materials.

Df-extract, a mite allergen, was obtained from LSL (Tokyo, Japan). 2 IntraPrep was purchased from Beckman Coulter (Marseille, France). Defined fetal 3 bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT, USA). 4 Penicillin was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA, USA). Roswell Park 5 Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 was purchased from Nissui Pharmaceutical (Tokyo, 6 Japan). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse IgE was obtained from 7 Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX, USA). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) 8 was purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 9 aluminum hydroxide gel were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 10 Protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, pelargonin, and ferulic acid were 11 obtained from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and syringic acid was purchased 12 from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. All chemicals used in this study were of the 13 highest analytical grade commercially available. 14 Preparation of a date extract. Dried date fruit that was harvested in the United Arab 15 Emirates (UAE) was obtained from Marubeni Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The fruit 16 (1,000 g), including peel and pulp but not seeds, was cut into pieces of approximate 5 × 17 5 mm, and boiled in 9,000 ml of hot distilled water for 2 h under reflux. The supernatant 18 was collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 30 min) and ultrafiltrated using a Stirred 19 Ultrafiltration Unit (Model UHP-150K; Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 20 with a Molecular/Por Ultrafiltration Membrane MWCO 500 (Spectrum Laboratories, 21 6  Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) to eliminate fructose and sucrose in the extract. 1 The residue on the membrane was then dissolved in 500 ml of distilled water, 2 freeze-dried and used as the date extract. The weight of date extract obtained from 1,000 3 g fruit was 70 g. The total content of polyphenols in the extract, determined according 4 to the Folin-Ciocalteu method used by Al-Farsi et al. (8), was 32.07 mg of ferulic acid 5 equivalents (FAE)/g. Hence, it was calculated that 1 g of the date fruit contained 2.24 6 mg of FAE of polyphenols. Al-Farsi et al. reported that the content of polyphenols in the 7 date fruit was 2.17 to 3.43 mg of FAE/g (8). The polyphenol content of date fruit used in 8 this study was within the amount of their report. On the other hand, we estimated that 9 the content of protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, 10 pelargonin and ferulic acid identified in the previous study (7) was 10.78, 0.88, 0.74, 11 7.55, 3.64 and 3.15 mg/g date extract, respectively, by ultra performance liquid 12 chromatography analysis. 13 Feeding procedure. Four-week-old male BALB/c mice were obtained from Japan 14 SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were assigned to different test regimens as shown in 15 Fig. 1. The mice were given a commercial mouse powder feed (MF, Oriental Yeast Co., 16 Tokyo, Japan) for 1 week, and were then given the defined protein-free purified diet 17 P5765 (Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 25% ovalbumin (control 18 diet) or a mixture of 24% ovalbumin and 1% date extract (date-diet) between 5 and 11 19 weeks of age (n = 5). The mice were intraperitoneally injected with 200 μl saline 20 solution containing 100 μg Df-extract and 2 mg aluminum hydroxide gel at 5, 6 and 7 21 Fig. 1 7  weeks of age. The mice were intranasally challenged by instillation with 20 μl distilled 1 water containing 20 μg Df-extract per week between 8 and 11 weeks of age. The 2 number of sneezing and nose rubbing events was then counted for 30 min, starting 1 3 min after the intranasal instillation. Food and water were supplied ad libitum throughout 4 the course of the experiment. The mice were housed at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C under 5 a standard 12-h light-dark cycle. Blood, spleen and Peyer’s patch samples were 6 collected immediately following a lethal dose of ether at 11 weeks of age. Serum was 7 obtained by centrifugation at 450 × g for 60 min at 4 °C and was stored at -30 °C until 8 use. All animal experimentations undertaken during this study were conducted in 9 accordance with the guidelines for the Regulation of Animal Experimentation at 10 Shinshu University, and according to Law no. 105 and Notification no. 6 of the 11 Japanese government. 12 Spleen and Peyer’s patch cell suspensions and cell cultures. Spleen and Peyer’s 13 patch cell suspensions were prepared as described previously (9). One thousand 14 microliters of the cell suspensions were plated into the wells of a 24-well flat bottom 15 plate (Sarstedt, Inc., Newton, NC, USA). Individual standard polyphenols were 16 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added into the medium at a final 17 concentration of 4 nmol/ml. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.01%, which has 18 been determined to be noncytotoxic. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 19 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h for cell function analysis. 20 Cell function analysis. Cell surface markers and intracellular cytokines were labeled 21 8  according to a previously described procedure (10). The cell number was determined 1 using a Guava personal cell functional analyzer (Guava PCA, Guava Technologies, 2 Hayward, CA, USA). 3 Antibody analysis. Serum total and Df-specific IgE levels were measured by an 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to a previously described 5 procedure (9). 6 Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). 7 Statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software package (ystat2004.xls, 8 Igakutosho Shuppan, Tokyo, Japan). Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) 9 was used to determine if there were significant differences in the numbers of sneezing 10 and nose rubbing events among group over time. When significant differences over time 11 were detected, two-way ANOVA (diet and week as independent variables) was used to 12 analyze the numbers of sneezing and nose rubbing events between the mice given the 13 date-diet and the mice given the control diet at the same weeks of age. Dunnett’s 14 multiple comparison tests for one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the numbers of 15 immunocompetent cells cultured with polyphenols. All other analyses were assessed 16 using Student’s t-test. All analyses were performed using the two-sided, and differences 17 were considered significant when P-values were less than 0.05. 18  19 Results 20 Effects of a date-diet on allergic symptoms in mice 21 9  Five-week-old BALB/c mice were given a date-diet or a control diet for 6 weeks. No 1 significant difference in body weight was observed between the mice given these diets 2 (data not shown). 3 Fig. 2 represents the number of sneezes (A) and nose rubbings (B) of the mice. The 4 number of sneezes was significantly lower in mice between 9 and 11 weeks of age that 5 were given the date-diet than in mice given the control diet. The number of nose 6 rubbings was significantly lower in mice between 8 and 11 weeks of age that were given 7 the date-diet than in mice given the control diet. 8 Effects of a date-diet on total and Df-specific IgE levels in mouse serum 9 Fig. 3 shows the serum level of total (A) and Df-specific (B) IgE. The total IgE level 10 was significantly lower in mice given the date-diet than in mice given the control diet. 11 In addition, the Df-specific IgE level was significantly lower in mice given the date-diet 12 than in mice given the control diet. 13 Effects of a date-diet on the number of immunocompetent cells in the spleen and Peyer’s 14 patch of mice 15 Fig. 4 represents the number of spleen IFN-γ+CD4+ (A) and IL-4+CD4+ (B) cells in 16 11-week-old mice. The number of IFN-γ+CD4+ cells was significantly higher, although 17 the number of IL-4+CD4+ cells was significantly lower, in mice given the date-diet than 18 in mice given the control diet. The ratio of IFN-γ+CD4+ cells/IL-4+CD4+ cells in the 19 mice given the date-diet was 1.97, while that in the mice given the control diet was 0.56. 20 Fig. 5 shows the number of spleen and Peyer’s patch CD80+CD11b+ (A, D), IgE+B220+ 21 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig. 5 10  (B, E) and FcεRIα+CD117+ (C, F) cells in 11-week-old mice. The number of IgE+B220+ 1 and FcεRIα+CD117+ cells was significantly lower in mice given the date-diet than in 2 mice given the control diet, although the number of CD11b+CD80+ cells did not differ 3 significantly between these two mouse groups. 4 Effects of various date polyphenols on the number of immunocompetent cells in mouse 5 spleen cell cultures 6 Table 1 shows the effect of six polyphenols previously identified in the date extract 7 (7) on cell number of two different types of cultured immunocompetent cells from 8 C3H/HeN mouse spleen. Chlorogenic acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid significantly 9 decreased the number of IgE+B220+ cells compared to polyphenol-free, protocatechuic 10 acid, caffeic acid and syringic acid. Chlorogenic acid and pelargonin significantly 11 reduced the number of FcεRIα+CD117+ cells compared to polyphenol-free, 12 protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid. 13  14 Discussion 15 Date fruit, or the fruit of the date palm tree, has been harvested in North Africa for at 16 least 3,500 years (11), and its cultivation has now spread to the Middle East, parts of 17 Central and South America, and Southern Europe (12, 13). Date fruit has been used in 18 the Middle East as a folk medicine to prevent various infectious diseases, indicating its 19 antimicrobial capacity (14, 15). We recently demonstrated that a date extract more 20 strongly enhanced the cellular immune system than prune or fig fruit extracts (7). In 21 Table 1 11  addition, the ratio of spleen and Peyer’s patch IFN-γ+CD4+/IL-4+CD4+ (Th1/Th2) cells 1 was higher in C3H/HeN mice that were given the date extract-added diet than in mice 2 given the extract-free diet. 3 Zhou et al. reported that type I allergic reactions were induced by intranasal 4 administration of Df after intraperitoneal injection of Df in BALB/c mice (16). They 5 also observed that the amount of total serum IgE in the mice without intraperitoneal 6 immunization was approximately 0.2 μg/ml, while that in mice with the immunization 7 was approximately 4 μg/ml or more (16). Hence, in the present study, we treated 8 BALB/c mice with Df according to the procedure described by Zhou et al. The serum 9 total IgE amount in the BALB/c mice given the control diet was 9.75 ± 2.87 μg/ml (Fig. 10 3). These facts indicate that the mice could be induced allergic reactions appropriately. 11 The number of sneezing and nose rubbing events was significantly lower in mice 12 given the date-diet between the ages of 9 to 11, and 8 to 11 weeks, respectively, than in 13 mice given the control diet (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the serum level of Df-specific IgE in 14 the mice given the date-diet was significantly lower than that in the mice given the 15 control diet (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the feeding of mice with the date-diet 16 decreases allergic symptoms such as sneezing and nose rubbing via the suppression of 17 Df-specific IgE production. 18 It is well established that IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 produced by Th2 cells stimulate IgE 19 production (1). The number of spleen Th2 cells in mice given the date-diet was 20 significantly lower than that in mice given the control diet (Fig. 4). This result indicates 21 12  that the decrease in the serum level of Df-specific IgE in the mice given the date-diet 1 was due to a decrease in the number of Th2 cells. 2 It is known that IgE+B220+ cells are IgE-producing B cells (plasma cells) (17). The 3 number of spleen and Peyer’s patch IgE+B220+ cells in mice given the date-diet was 4 significantly lower than that in mice given the control diet (Fig. 5B, E). These results 5 indicate that the date extract may reduce the number of IgE-producing plasma cells in 6 both the systemic and local immune systems. 7 The onset of type I allergic diseases is ultimately associated with the degranulation of 8 mast cells. Expression of the FcεRI, a high-affinity IgE receptor (1), on mast cells is 9 necessary for degranulation. Mast cells are normally defined on the basis of cell surface 10 expression of both FcεRIα and CD117 (18). The number of spleen and Peyer’s patch 11 FcεRIα+CD117+ cells in mice given the date-diet was significantly lower than that in 12 mice given the control diet (Fig. 5C, F). These results indicate that the anti-allergic 13 effect of the date extract is also partly due to a reduction in the number of high-affinity 14 IgE receptor-expressing mast cells. 15 We previously identified six kinds of polyphenols; protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic 16 acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid in a date extract on UPLC 17 (7). In that study, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid increased the number of 18 IFN-γ+CD4+ cells, chlorogenic acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid enhanced the number of 19 IFN-γ+CD49b+ cells, while chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid increased the 20 number of IL-12+CD11b+ cells in C3H/HeN mouse Peyer’s patch cell cultures. In the 21 13  present study, we found that chlorogenic acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid significantly 1 decreased the number of IgE+B220+ cells, whereas chlorogenic acid and pelargonin 2 significantly reduced the number of FcεRIα+CD117+ cells (Table 1). These results 3 suggest that chlorogenic acid, pelargonin and ferulic acid might be associable with the 4 reduction of IgE-producing plasma cell and high-affinity IgE receptor-expressing mast 5 cell numbers in the mice given the date-diet. On the other hand, we also estimated that 6 β-D-glucan could be present in the date extract (7). It has been reported that a certain 7 structure of β-D-glucan suppressed the allergic symptoms (19). It could be therefore 8 likely that the anti-allergic effect of the date extract might be partly due to the action of 9 β-D-glucan. 10 In conclusion, we note that date fruit appears to suppress acquired allergic responses 11 via a reduction in the number of IgE-producing plasma cells and high-affinity IgE 12 receptor-expressing mast cells. In order to use date fruit as an effective anti-allergic 13 food material, a further investigation including the confirmation of the anti-allergic 14 effect of β-D-glucan in the date extract is now in progress.15 14  References 1 1) Platts-Mills TA. 2001.
