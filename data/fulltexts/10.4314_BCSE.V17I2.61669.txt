A novel indole alkaloid, nauclefolinine (1) and five known triterpenic compounds, rotundic acid (2), α-L-rhamnoquinovic acid (3), 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-sitosterol (4), squalene (5) and sitosterol-3-O-6’-stearoyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (6) have been isolated from the roots of Nauclea latifolia.  KEY WORDS: Nauclea latifolia, Rubiaceae, Indole alkaloid, Triterpenic acids, Rotundic acid, Rhamnoquinovic acid  INTRODUCTION  Nauclea latifolia Smith is a large evergreen tree abundant in the rain forests of West and Central Africa. The bark finds some local use in the treatment of stomach pains, fever and sometimes diarrhoea [1]. Previous work on Nauclea latifolia has yielded a number of alkaloids [2, 3]. We here present the isolation and the structural elucidation of a new alkaloid (1), together with five previously known triterpene derivatives identified as rotundic acid (2) [4], α-L-Rhamnoquinovic acid (3) [5], 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β sitosterol (4) [6], squalene (5) [7] and sitosterol-3-O-6’-stearoyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (6) [8].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Nauclefolinine 1 was isolated as a dark brown powder m.p. 115-116 °C, [α]25D +3 (CH2Cl2, c 0.6). Its UV spectrum showed two absorption maxima at 224 and 282 nm characteristic of indole alkaloids [9]. The study of its IR spectrum indicated the presence of a lactam group (1660 cm-1), monoalkylated external exocyclic carbon-carbon double bond (1736 cm-1) [10] and a secondary amine group (3298 cm-1).  The mass spectrum agreed with the C21H24N2O3 formula for compound 1. Observation in its mass spectrum of fragments ions at m/z 169 (52%), 156 (27%), 144 (40%) and 143 (72%) suggests the presence of tetrahydro β-carboline ring. The 13C NMR of 1 displayed signals for 21 carbon atoms: one vinyl methyl and one OMe ether, four methylenes (sp3), nine methines including five olefinic, three sp3 carbons and one sp3 bearing oxygen, six quaternary sp2 carbons including one carbonyl group and two carbon atoms bearing nitrogen. This was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum in which two methyls were observed as singlet and doublet. The signal which appears at δ 3.40 is attributed to the OMe group due to the downfield shift. The proton geminal to this group appears as a doublet at 5.30. This value of the chemical shift indicated D. Ngnokam et al.  Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2003, 17(2) 174that, this methine group bears two oxygen atoms. RCH2OR’ protons appear at 3.75 and 4.20, the aromatic protons together appear between 7.34 and 7.50, and the exchangeable amine proton (RNHR’) at 8.21 ppm. The comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum data (see Table 1) of 1 and those of strictosamide (7) [5] allowed to suggest that, those compounds would have the same carbon skeleton. The carbon-carbon double bond C16-C17 of strictosamide has been hydrogenated, and the terminal double bond C18-C19 does not exist in compound 1. This terminal double bond C18-C19 would have migrated inside between the carbons C19 and C20. This suggestion has been confirmed by the Cosy spectrum which showed correlations between H18 and H19, H16 and H15, H19 and H21 on the one hand H16 and the RCH2OR’protons on the other. Coupling between H3 and H14, H14 and H15 were also observed and the coupling constant value (11.4 Hz) between H15 and H16 allowed to suggest that, the latter proton is fixed in α position of carbon C16.

NMR spectra were recorded at 125 MHz for 13C and 500 MHz for 1H. Chemical shifts are given in δ value (ppm) with TMS as internal standard. EI-MS was measured at 70 eV. TLC was carried out on silica gel. The alkaloid was detected by their intense D. Ngnokam et al.  Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2003, 17(2) 176yellow-white fluorescence in UV light (365 nm), by the yellow colour obtained on spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent. The triterpenoid compounds were detected by spraying with 50% solution of H2SO4 in H2O following by heating. UV spectra were determined as methanol solutions.  Plant material. The roots of Nauclea latifolia SM were collected on February 1998 in Foumban (Western Province of Cameroon). A voucher specimen has been deposited at the National Herbarium, Yaounde.   Extraction and isolation. The air dried powdered material (3 kg) was extracted in the mixture of methanol and methylene chloride (1:1) (10 L) and the extract was divided in to chloroform and methanol portions. The chloroform soluble fraction (40 g) was subjected to a silica gel dry flash chromatography, elution performed with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate of increasing polarity followed by the mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol. Fractions eluted with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (60:40) were rechromatographed over silica gel to yield compound 1 (15 mg).  Fractions obtained with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (20:80) were purified over silica gel to yield 2 (35 mg), 3 (25 mg), 4 (60 mg) and 6 (20 mg) while 5 (22 mg) was obtained from fractions eluted with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (9.5:0.5). TLC data indicated the following polarity from the less to the more polar compound: 5, 1, 6, 2, 3 and 4 with the retention factor 1, 0.86, 0.63, 0.51, 0.43 and 0.2, respectively in the mixture CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5).
