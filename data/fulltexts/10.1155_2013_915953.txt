e objective of the present study was to determine whether Artemisia iwayomogi (AI) extract reduces visceral fat accumulation
and obesity-related biomarkers in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and if so, whether these eﬀects are exerted by modulation of
the expression of genes associated with adipogenesis and in�ammation. AI extract supplementation for 11 weeks signi�cantly
prevented HFD-induced increments in body weight, visceral adiposity, adipocyte hypertrophy, and plasma levels of lipids and
leptin. Additionally, AI extract supplementation resulted in downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors (PPAR𝛾𝛾2 and
C/EBP𝛼𝛼) and their target genes (CD36, aP2, and FAS) in epididymal adipose tissue compared to the HFD alone. e AI extract
eﬀectively reversed the HFD-induced elevations in plasma glucose and insulin levels and the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance index. Furthermore, the extract signi�cantly decreased gene expression of proin�ammatory cytokines (TNF𝛼𝛼,
MCP1, IL-6, IFN𝛼𝛼, and INF𝛽𝛽) in epididymal adipose tissue and reduced plasma levels of TNF𝛼𝛼 and MCP1 as compared to HFD
alone. In conclusion, these results suggest that AI extract may prevent HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders, probably by
downregulating the expression of genes related to adipogenesis and in�ammation in visceral adipose tissue.
1. Introduction
Adipogenesis is the process by which mesenchymal pre-
cursor cells diﬀerentiate into adipocytes [1]. Although its
presence is necessary in many ways, excess adipose tissue
is associated with serious health problems such as obesity,
cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes [2, 3]. Presently,
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein 𝛼𝛼 (C/EBP𝛼𝛼) and peroxi-
some proliferator-activated receptor 𝛾𝛾2 (PPAR𝛾𝛾2) are consid-
ered the 2 primary transcription factors that mediate adipo-
genesis. It has been reported that inactivation of PPAR𝛾𝛾2 and
C/EBP𝛼𝛼 in adipose tissue protects against obesity in rodent
models [4–6].us, potential therapeutic agents that have the
ability to inhibit adipogenesis could have a profound impact
as a strategy for preventing obesity and related metabolic
disorders.
Adipose tissue not only serves as an organ for energy
storage, but also as an endocrine organ by releasing vari-
ous in�ammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor
𝛼𝛼 (TNF𝛼𝛼) and interleukin- (IL-)6 [7–9]. Proin�ammatory
molecules produced by adipose tissue have been implicated
as active participants in the development of in�ammation
and the increased risk of obesity-related insulin resistance
[9–11]. Increased production of monocyte chemoattractant
protein 1 (MCP1), interferon (IFN) 𝛼𝛼, IFN𝛽𝛽, TNF𝛼𝛼, and
IL-6 in adipose tissue has been reported in animal models
of obesity [8–10, 12]. erefore, therapeutic agents that
attenuate proin�ammatory cytokines may prove useful in the
medical management of obesity-induced in�ammation.
Artemisia iwayomogi (AI), a member of Compositae,
is a perennial herb easily found throughout Korea. It has
been used as a traditional medicine and is known to have
2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
antiallergic, antiapoptotic, and antioxidant eﬀects [13–16].
It has been reported that a carbohydrate fraction from
AI suppresses spontaneous or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin-induced apoptotic death of mouse thymocytes [14,
15]. Artemisia iwayomogi extract displays scavenging activity
of peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic oxidant formed by the
reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide radicals [16].
In addition, to our knowledge, few studies have described
the bene�cial eﬀects of AI in high-fat diet-(HFD-) fed obese
rodents. One study reported that oral administration of AI
extract signi�cantly reduced serum lipid levels in HFD-fed
rats [17]. A recent study by Cho et al. reported that oral
administration of AI extract to HFD-fed mice provoked
upregulation of PPAR𝛽𝛽 and its target genes involved in fatty
acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle [18]. To date, however,
no study has assessed the protective eﬀects of AI extract
on adipose tissue dysfunction in diet-induced obese animal
models. erefore, the present study aimed to investigate
whether AI extract could reduce visceral fat accumulation
and improve obesity-related biomarkers in HFD-fed mice,
and if so, whether these eﬀects were exerted by modulation
of the expression of genes associated with adipogenesis and
in�ammation.
2. Material andMethods
2.1. Preparation of AI Extract. Artemisia iwayomogi was
collected fromKorean standard products inMarch 2008, and
was identi�ed by Professor Wan Kyun Whang of the Phar-
maceutical Botany Laboratory at Chung-Ang University in
Seoul, Republic of Korea, where a voucher specimen has been
deposited. Dried AI (500 g) was washed in water, oven dried
at 40∘C, mechanically fragmented, and then was powdered
in an electric mill. e powder was extracted 5 times with
ethanol (powder : solvent = 1 : 5) at room temperature. Aer
�ltration, the extraction was vacuum concentrated to yield
6.25% ethanol extract (31.3 g), which was stored at −4∘C until
use.
2.2. HPLC Analysis. Chromatography was performed using
a Water HPLC system (Water Corporation, Milford, MA,
USA) with an autosampler. HPLC separation was conducted
using a Kromasil C18 column (4.6mm × 250mm, 5-𝜇𝜇m
inner diameter) at 30∘C with a �ow rate of 1.0mL/min
using a gradient mobile phase composed of water (A) and
acetonitrile (B). e mobile phase comprised an 80 : 20
mixture of component A to B as the initial condition of
the chromatographic run, and component B was increased
to 80% in a linear gradient in 30min. e sample injection
volume was 10 𝜇𝜇L. e identities of the compounds in the
AI extract were con�rmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and MS,
with individual purities of not less than 95%.
2.3. Animals and Experimental Protocol. Male C57BL/6J
mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from Orient Bio (Gyeo-
nggi-do, Republic of Korea) and were maintained in 12 h
light/dark with ad libitum access to food and water. Aer a
1-week acclimatization period, the mice were divided into
3 groups (𝑛𝑛 𝑛 1𝑛 per group): normal diet (ND), HFD, and
0.5% AI extract-supplemented diet (AED). e ND was a
puri�ed diet based on the AIN-76 rodent diet composition.
e HFD was identical to the ND, but to which 200 g
fat/kg (170 g lard plus 30 g corn oil) and 1% cholesterol
had been added. e AED was identical to the HFD but
contained 0.5% (w/w) AI extract. e mice were fed the
experimental diets for 11 weeks. Diet consumption was
monitored daily, and body weight was monitored weekly.
At the end of the feeding period, mice were anesthetized
with diethyl ether aer an overnight fasting for 16 h, and
their blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated tubes.
Plasma samples were isolated by centrifugation at 4000×g for
20min and stored at −80∘C for subsequent analysis. Adipose
and liver tissues were collected, washed with phosphate-
buﬀered saline, and frozen at −80∘C. All animal experiments
were performed in accordance with the Korean Food and
Drug Administration guidelines. e Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Yonsei Laboratory Animal
Research Center reviewed and approved the protocols.
2.4. Biochemical Analysis. Plasma concentrations of triglyc-
erides (TGs), free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, total cholesterol,
and HDL cholesterol were measured using commercial kits
(Bio-Clinical System, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). LDL
+ VLDL cholesterol levels were calculated by subtracting
HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol. Plasma insulin levels
were analyzed using a mouse insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO
Diagnostics, Windham, NH, USA). e homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was
calculated as fasting plasma glucose concentration (mmol/L)
multiplied by fasting insulin level (pmol/L) divided by 22.5.
Plasma levels for leptin, TNF𝛼𝛼, and MCP1 were measured
using a mouse ELISA kit (ID Labs, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Hepatic lipids were extracted as described by Folch et al.
[19], using a chloroform-methanol mixture (2 : 1 v/v), and
the dried lipid residues were dissolved in 2mL ethanol.
Concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty
acids in the hepatic lipid extracts were measured using the
same enzymatic kits that were used for the plasma analysis.
2.5. Histological Analysis. White adipose tissues (WATs)were
�xed in neutral buﬀered formalin, embedded in para�n,
and sectioned into 5 𝜇𝜇m sections onto slides. For histology,
sectionswere stainedwith hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).e
sectional areas of WAT were analyzed to quantify the size of
the adipocytes.
2.6. RNA Extraction and Semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total
RNA was isolated from the epididymal adipose tissue of
each mouse with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Isolated RNA
was quanti�ed using a spectrophotometer, and cDNA was
synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). e
PCR was programmed as follows: 10min at 94∘C; 30–33
cycles at 94∘C for 30 s, 55∘C for 30 s; 72∘C for 1min;
10min incubation at 72∘C. Four microliters of each PCR
reaction weremixed with 1 𝜇𝜇L of 6-fold concentrated loading
buﬀer and loaded onto 2% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide. e GenBank accession numbers of the relevant

3. Results
3.1. Chromatographic Analysis of Artemisia iwayomogi
Extract. e HPLC chromatogram revealed that scopolin
(AI-I, 1.21% w/w), acetophenone glycoside (AI-II, 0.26%
w/w), and scopoletin (AI-III, 0.38% w/w) were the major
components among the organic molecules of the AI extract,
which exhibited maximum absorbance at 280 nm (Figure 1
and Table 2).
3.2. Body and Visceral Fat Pad Weights. AED-fed mice
exhibited signi�cantly decreased body weight gain (−52%)
and �nal body weight (−19%) compared to HFD-fed mice
without their food intake being aﬀected (Figures 2(a)–2(c)).

(see Table 2).
e food e�ciency ratio (FER) was signi�cantly lower in
AED-fed mice (−54%) compared to HFD-fed mice (Figure
2(d)). e AI extract supplementation led to a signi�cant
decrease in total visceral fat pad weight (−64%) compared
to the HFD alone. is was attributable to weight decreases
in the epididymal (−54%), retroperitoneal (−58%), perirenal
(−83%), and mesenteric (−69%) adipose depots (𝑃𝑃 < 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
for all depots; Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). e H&E sections of
epididymal adipose tissues revealed that adipocyte diameter
(−20%) was signi�cantly decreased in AED-fed mice than in
HFD-fed mice (Figure 2(g)).

3.3. Plasma Biochemistries. Plasma concentrations of TG
(−47%), FFA (−47%), total cholesterol (−47%), HDL choles-
terol (−34%), and LDL + VLDL cholesterol (−59%) were all
signi�cantly lower in AED-fed mice than in HFD-fed mice
(𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, Figures 3(a)–3(e)). AED-fedmice had signi�cantly
lower plasma concentrations of leptin (−71%) than HFD-
fed mice (Figure 3(f)). Likewise, the AI extract signi�cantly
attenuated the elevation in plasma concentrations of glucose
(−42%) and insulin (−21%) in HFD-fed mice (Figures 3(g)
and 3(h)). e HOMA-IR calculations revealed that the AI
extract signi�cantly decreased the HOMA-IR index (−49%)
compared to HFD alone (Figure 3(i)). AED-fed mice had
signi�cantly lower plasma concentrations of MCP1 (−60%)
and TNF𝛼𝛼 (−46%) than HFD-fed mice (Figures 3(j) and
3(k)).
3.4. Hepatic Lipid Accumulation. AED-fed mice had sig-
ni�cantly lower liver weight (−30%) than in HFD-fed
mice (Figure 4(a)). Hepatic triglyceride (−66%), cholesterol
(−51%), and free fatty acid (−75%) concentrations were
markedly lower in AED-fed mice than in HFD-fed mice
(Figures 4(b)–4(d)).
3.5. Expression of Genes Related to Adipogenesis. Examina-
tion of adipogenic gene expression in epididymal adipose
tissue showed that mRNA levels of PPAR𝛾𝛾2 (−44%) and
C/EBP𝛼𝛼 (−18%), regulators of adipogenic molecules, were
signi�cantly lower in AED-fed mice than in HFD-fed mice.
e expressions of PPAR𝛾𝛾2 target genes, including cluster
of diﬀerentiation 36 (CD36) (−29%), adipocyte fatty acid
binding protein (aP2) (−35%), and fatty acid synthase (FAS)
(−58%), were all signi�cantly decreased in AED-fed mice
than in HFD-fed mice (Figure 5).
3.�. Expression of Genes Related to �n�ammation. Based on
the active roles of proin�ammatory cytokines in obesity-
related in�ammation, we examined the eﬀect of AI extract on
proin�ammatory cytokine expressions in epididymal adipose
tissue. Compared to HFD-fed mice, the epididymal adipose
tissue in AED-fed mice contained signi�cantly decreased
mRNA levels of several proin�ammatory cytokines, includ-
ing TNF𝛼𝛼 (−41%), IL-6 (−28%), MCP1 (−32%), IFN𝛼𝛼
(−41%), and IFN𝛽𝛽 (−38%) (Figure 6).
4. Discussion
is feeding study was designed to assess whether AI extract
supplementation for 11 weeks could improve diet-induced
obesity and obesity-related biomarkers in mice. Based on
a preliminary study involving diﬀerent AI extract dosages
(0.5%, 1%, and 2%), we determined that 0.5% AI extract
was the minimal eﬀective dose for preventing weight gain

extract was considered for this study. In the present study,
the AI extract signi�cantly decreased not only body weight
gain, but also visceral adiposity and adipocyte hypertrophy
in HFD-fed mice. Since visceral adiposity is positively cor-
related to plasma leptin concentration, the circulating leptin
level is an ideal indicator for assessing obesity in both
experimental animals and humans [20, 21]. In this context,

the lower plasma leptin level recorded in the AED-fed mice
may be attributable to the prevention of visceral adipocyte
hypertrophy.
As there was no signi�cant diﬀerence in food con-
sumption between HFD- and AED-fed mice, the bene�cial
eﬀects of the AI extract on body weight gain and visceral
fat accumulation evidently did not depend on decreased
energy intake. us, we hypothesized that the AI extract
reduced HFD-induced body weight gain and visceral fat
accumulation by mediating the inhibition of adipogenesis.
at the expression of PPAR𝛾𝛾2 and C/EBP𝛼𝛼 in WAT is
upregulated in HFD-induced obese animals is well known [4,
22]. Increased PPAR𝛾𝛾2 and C/EBP𝛼𝛼 function cooperatively
to transactivate adipocyte genes, including FAS, CD36, and
aP2 [23–26]. FAS catalyzes the reactions for the synthesis of
long-chain fatty acids [27], whereas CD36 and aP2 facilitate
the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in adipocytes [23, 28],
thereby increasing adipocyte size and fat accumulation. In the
current study, the AI extract signi�cantly reversed the HFD-
induced upregulation of adipogenic transcription factors
(PPAR𝛾𝛾2 and C/EBP𝛼𝛼) and their target genes (FAS, CD36,
and aP2) in the epididymal adipose tissue of mice. ese
decreased expressions of adipogenic genes by the AI extract
may have contributed to the lower visceral adiposity and
body weight gain. In addition, the AI extract signi�cantly
decreased plasma FFA levels in HFD-fed mice. As increased
plasma concentrations of FFA form a vicious relationship
with PPAR𝛾𝛾2 activation in diet-induced obese animals [29,
30], the decreased FFA level in the AED-fed mice might also
be considered associated with PPAR𝛾𝛾2 inactivation.
Increased adipose tissue accumulation in obese individ-
uals correlates with the overproduction of proin�ammatory
cytokines that play crucial roles in the development of
obesity-induced in�ammation [8, 11]. In obese animals,
excess adipose tissue increases the expression and secretion
of TNF𝛼𝛼, a prototypical in�ammatory cytokine [4, 9, 12]. In
turn, increased TNF𝛼𝛼 activates adipocytes, thereby further
enhancing the expression of various proin�ammatory genes
such as MCP1, IL-6, IFN𝛼𝛼, and IFN𝛽𝛽 [31, 32]. IL-6 induces
a hepatic acute-phase reaction with upregulated acute-phase
proteins, including C-reactive protein and �brinogen [33,
34], whereas MCP1 contributes to macrophage in�ltration
into adipose tissue, which leads to chronic in�ammation
[35]. IFN𝛼𝛼/𝛽𝛽 directly stimulates IFN𝛾𝛾 production, a regulator
of innate immune response, in T cells [36]. Our results
suggested that the decrease in visceral adiposity by the AI
extract might have contributed, in part, to the decreased
expression of proin�ammatory cytokines (TNF𝛼𝛼, MCP1, IL-
6, IFN𝛼𝛼, and IFN𝛽𝛽) and reduced plasma levels of TNF𝛼𝛼
andMCP1. Consequently, the decreased gene expression and
secretion of proin�ammatory cytokines in the AED-fed mice
may have contributed to the prevention of obesity-induced
in�ammation.
Several studies have demonstrated that cytokines play
crucial roles in the development of insulin resistance [35, 37–
39]. In diet-induced obese animals, increased plasma levels
of TNF𝛼𝛼, IL-6, MCP1, and leptin have been shown to impair
the ability of insulin to activate signal transduction and
stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue [35, 37–41].us, in the present study, improvement of
insulin resistance by the AI extract might be associated with
decreased gene expression and/or production of cytokines
such as TNF𝛼𝛼, IL-6, MCP1, and leptin.
Separation and determination of chemical constituents
are generally recommended for standardization and quality
control of herbal products and herb-related investigations
[42]. Several studies have demonstrated that AI contains
�avonoids such as genkwanin and �aceosidin [43], essential
oils, including eugenol and 1,8-cineole [44], and coumarin
compounds such as scopoletin and scopolin [43, 45]. In
addition, scopoletin has been used as a standard compound
for the veri�cation and identi�cation of AI [46, 47]. In
the present study, we isolated not only scopoletin, but also
scopolin and acetophenone glycoside from the AI extract
(Figure 1 and Table 2). Of these, scopolin (1.21%) was
the most abundant, followed by scopoletin (0.38%) and
acetophenone glycoside (0.26%). In addition, the scopolin
content of the AI extract was higher in our study than that
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9
observed by Kim et al. (0.49% w/w) and Ding et al. (0.2%
w/w) [43, 45]. is diﬀerence may be due to the diﬀering
extraction and isolation methods as well as diﬀerences in
plant material [43, 45]. Previous studies have shown that
coumarin compounds from Fraxinus rhynchophylla [48],
Angelica gigas [49], and Ionidium suﬀruticosum [50] inhibit
adipocyte diﬀerentiation in 3T3-L1 cells and/or reduce body
weight gain and plasma lipid levels in mice fed a high-fat
diet. us, the antiobesity activity of AI extract observed
in the present study may be attributable to the presence of
high amounts of coumarin compounds in the plant. Further
studies are needed to determine the major active compounds
in AI extract that are responsible for decreased visceral
adiposity and other obesity-related biomarkers.
In summary, the present study showed that AI extract
reduced visceral fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice and
improved the risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome,
such as in�ammation and insulin resistance. e evidence
obtained in this study suggests that the bene�cial eﬀects of
AI extract may be due to, at least in part, downregulation of
the genes related to adipogenesis and in�ammation in the
visceral adipose tissue of mice. erefore, dietary supple-
mentation with this extract, if validated in human studies,
may provide an adjunctive therapy for the prevention and/or
treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.
