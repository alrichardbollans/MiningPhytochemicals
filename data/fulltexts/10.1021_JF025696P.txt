Box 12065, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Jerusalem 91120, IsraelSicilian cultivars of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus indica) produce yellow, red, and white fruits, due tothe combination of two betalain pigments, the purple-red betanin and the yellow-orange indicaxanthin.The betalain distribution in the three cultivars and the antioxidant activities of methanolic extractsfrom edible pulp were investigated. In addition, the reducing capacity of purified betanin andindicaxanthin was measured. According to a spectrophotometric analysis, the yellow cultivar exhibitedthe highest amount of betalains, followed by the red and white ones. Indicaxanthin accounted forabout 99% of betalains in the white fruit, while the ratio of betanin to indicaxanthin varied from 1:8(w:w) in the yellow fruit to 2:1 (w:w) in the red one. Polyphenol pigments were negligible componentsonly in the red fruit. When measured as 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid(Trolox) equivalents per gram of pulp, the methanolic fruit extracts showed a marked antioxidantactivity. Vitamin C did not account for more than 40% of the measured activity. In addition, the extractsdose-dependently inhibited the organic hydroperoxide-stimulated red cell membrane lipid oxidation,as well as the metal-dependent and -independent low-density lipoprotein oxidation. The extract fromthe white fruit showed the highest protection in all models of lipid oxidation. Purified betanin andindicaxanthin were more effective than Trolox at scavenging the [2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] diammonium salt cation radical. Cyclic voltammetric measurements show two anodicwaves for betanin and indicaxanthin, and differential pulse voltammetry shows three anodic wavesfor betanin, with calculated peak potentials of 404, 616, and 998 mV, and two anodic waves forindicaxanthin, with peak potentials of 611 and 895 mV. Betanin underwent complex formation throughchelation with Cu2+, whereas indicaxanthin was not modified. These findings suggest that the abovebetalains contribute to the antioxidant activity of prickly pear fruits.KEYWORDS: Betalains; natural antioxidants; low-density lipoprotein; prickly pear; betanin; indicaxanthinINTRODUCTIONEvidence continues to emerge suggesting that componentsof fruits and vegetables may be protective against oxidativedamage (1-3). In addition to antioxidant vitamins and minerals,polyphenols and other non-nutrient compounds of vegetablesand fruits have been recognized as potential factors which canbe beneficial to human health (4-6). The prickly pear (Opuntiaficus indica) is a member of the Cactaceae family and is widelydistributed in Mexico, much of Latin America, South Africa,and the Mediterranean area. The nutritional properties of thefresh stems (cladodes) have long been known, and prickly pearis used also in traditional medicine for its hypoglycemic andhypolipidemic actions (7-9). In the industrialized countries ofthe Mediterranean area, cladodes are not a usual nutritionalsource for humans, but the fruits are largely consumed. Sicilyranks second among all countries in the world for producingand exporting prickly pear fruits.The prickly pear fruits are characterized by various colorsdue to the combination of two betalain pigments, the purple-red betanin and the yellow-orange indicaxantin (10-12, Figure1). The yellow cultivar is the main cultivar in Sicily, accounting* Address correspondence to Prof. Maria A.

Sweet and tasty fruits of prickly pear, ripening betweenthe end of July and November, may be easily found asspontaneous vegetation, but products from cultivations are nowusually marketed. The nutrients and chemical composition ofthe prickly pear fruit have been reported (13, 14). In contrast,though it is known that the fruit contains vitamin C (13, 14),studies on other antioxidant components and on the antioxidantcapacity are lacking. In this context, the characteristic pigmentsof the prickly pear should be taken into consideration. Betaninhas recently been reported to possess antioxidant activity(15-17). Antioxidant properties of indicaxanthin, if any, arenot known.This study measured betalain compounds and investigatedthe antioxidant activity of aqueous extracts from the red, yellow,and white fruits of prickly pear from the Sicilian cultivars. Threeestablished screening assays, i.e., the [2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylben-zothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] diammonium salt (ABTS) radicalcation decolorization assay, the inhibition of the tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced membrane lipid oxidation in human redblood cells, and the inhibition of the metal-dependent and-independent oxidative modification of human low-densitylipoprotein (LDL), have been used. In addition, characterizationof the isolated betanin and indicaxanthin, including measurementof their antioxidant potential as 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivalents (ABTS test),investigation of their ability to interact with Cu2+ ions, and cyclicvoltammetric measurement of their redox potential, has beenperformed.MATERIALS AND METHODSPotassium persulfate, 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (TEP), ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), quercetin dihydrate, ascorbic acid, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, Sephadex G-25 (Fine), and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).Trolox and ABTS were from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Gillingham, UK).2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) was from Poly-science, Inc. (Warrington, PA). All other materials and solvents wereof the highest purity or high-performance HPLC grade (Merck,Darmstadt, Germany).Preparation of Fruit Extracts. Prickly pear fruits, collected inSeptember-November 2001 in Sicily (Italy), were obtained from alocal market and were processed within 48-72 h of collection. Fourdifferent lots of fruits, at comparable ripening stages, were analyzedfor each cultivar. The fruits were peeled and finely chopped. The pulpwas separated from the seeds and weighed, and 100-g pulp sampleswere homogenized with 100 mL of methanol. The mixtures wereallowed to stand for 60 min at 4 °C before centrifugation (10 min at3000g). The organic layer was then recovered and the extractionrepeated with the same volume of methanol. The combined extractswere subjected to rotary evaporation to remove the organic solvents.All the samples were portioned and stored at -80 °C.Lipid Oxidation in Red Blood Cells and in LDL. Blood sampleswere obtained from apparently healthy individuals by venipuncture,with informed consent. EDTA (1 mg/mL blood) was used as ananticoagulant. Red blood cells (RBCs) were sedimented at 1000g for10 min, and plasma was collected to isolate LDL (see below). RBCswere washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4,and the supernatant and buffy coat were carefully removed by aspirationafter each wash.A 1% suspension of RBCs in PBS (HT 1%) was incubated with 50íM tert-butyl hydroperoxide at 37 °C, either in the absence or in thepresence of variable amounts of methanolic extract of prickly pear fruits.At time intervals, malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured as an indexof lipid oxidation. Briefly, 0.250 mL of the incubation mixture wasmixed with 1.5 mL of hypotonic PBS, 0.250 mL of PBS, 5 íL of 40mM BHT, and 5 íL of 1 M NaOH. After cell homogenization, 0.250mL of 0.6% TBA in 35% HClO4 was added, and the suspension washeated for 60 min. Samples were then cooled and centrifuged at 1000gfor 10 min, and the MDA-TBA adduct in the supernatant was separatedby isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), per-formed on a Supelco Supelcosil LC-18 column (0.46  25 cm). Theeluent was CH3CN/H2O (70:30) at 1 mL min-1. The MDA-TBAadduct was revealed spectrophotometrically at 532 nm and quantifiedby reference to a calibration curve of TEP submitted to the TBAcolorimetric procedure.LDL (d ) 1.019-1.063 g/mL) was isolated from EDTA plasma bystepwise ultracentrifugation at 4 °C in a Beckman L8-70 M ultracen-trifuge, fitted with a 50 Ti rotor using potassium bromide for densityadjustments, according to Kleinveld et al. (18). The LDL fraction wasshown to be free of other lipoproteins by electrophoresis on agarosegel. EDTA and salts were removed from LDL by gel filtration onSephadex G-25. Proteins were determined by the Bio Rad colorimetricmethod (19). LDL protein (0.2 mg/mL) was incubated in the absenceor in the presence of methanolic extracts of prickly pear fruits, inoxygen-satured EDTA-free PBS, supplemented with 10 íM CuCl2 asa pro-oxidant, in a 1-mL quartz cuvette. LDL oxidation was followedby continuosly monitoring the formation at 37 °C of conjugated diene(CD) lipid hydroperoxides at 234 nm (20).In other experiments, 0.1 mg/mL LDL proteins were oxidized by0.5 mM AAPH, with all other conditions as described above.Analysis of Polyphenols and Vitamin C. Methanolic extracts from200 mg of edible pulp were treated with ethyl acetate (1:4 v/v) toseparate polyphenol compounds from betalains. Spectrophotometricanalysis between 200 and 600 nm was carried out, and flavonols wereevaluated from the absorption peak at 360 nm, using pure quercetin asa standard.Evaluation of ascorbic acid in methanolic extracts was done byreversed-phase HPLC, with spectrophotometric revelation at 266 nm,as reported by Lazzarino et al. (21) with minor changes. These includedthe length of the HPLC column (25  0.46 cm) and isocratic elutionwith 10 mM KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% methanol and 10mL/L tetrabutylammonium bromide, at 1.2 mL min-1. The retentiontime of ascorbate was 5.3 min. Quantitation was by reference to curvesconstructed with 5-100 ng of pure compound.Quantitation of Betalains in Fruit Extracts. Betanin in themethanolic pulp extracts was spectrophotometrically evaluated by theabsorbance at 536 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 65 000(22). Owing to the overlapping of betanin absorbance with theabsorbance of indicaxanthin at 482 nm [calculated A482(betanin) )30 900], the indicaxanthin concentration in crude extracts containingboth pigments was calculated according to eq 1:This equation was obtained by applying algorithms based on the molarabsorbance of indicaxanthin at 482 nm [A482(indicaxanthin) ) 42 600;(10)] and of betanin at either 536 (22) or 482 nm.Purification of Indicaxanthin and Betanin. Betanin and indica-xanthin were separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column(40 cm  2.2 cm) according to Kanner et al. (17), with minormodifications. Briefly, aliquots of methanol extracts from 2 g of freshpulp were eluted with 1% acetic acid. Fractions (2.5 mL) were collectedand tested spectrophotometrically at 482 and 536 nm for the presenceof indicaxanthin and betanin, respectively (10, 11). The elution profileFigure 1. Chemical structures of betanin and indicaxanthin.[indicaxanthin] (íM) ) 23.8A482 - 7.7A536 (1)6896 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 50, No. 23, 2002 Butera et al.provided evidence that complete separation of the two pigments wasachieved. The isolated pigments were submitted to high-performanceliquid chromatography analysis on a Varian Microsorb C-18 column(1  25 cm, Varian, Palo Alto, CA), eluted with a 20-min linear gradientelution from solvent A (1% acetic acid in water) to 20% solvent B(1% acetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (12).Spectrophotometric revelation was at 536 and 482 nm for betanin (12.4min) and indicaxanthin (13.6 min), respectively. A minor peak in theHPLC chromatogram, tentatively identified as isobetanin (13.3 min)(23), accounted for 0.5% of the isolated betanin. The elution volumesrelevant to indicaxanthin and betanin were collected. Samples aftercryoessiccation were resuspended in PBS at suitable concentrations formeasurements of antioxidant potential and cyclic voltammetry.Total Antioxidant Potential. The total antioxidant activity of eitherfruit extracts or purified pigments was evaluated using the ABTS radicalcation decolorization assay (24). ABTS¥+ was prepared by reactingABTS with potassium persulfate (25). Samples were analyzed induplicate, at three different dilutions, within the linearity range of theassay. The assay was standardized with the synthetic antioxidant Trolox,and results were expressed as Trolox equivalents per gram of ediblepulp or Trolox molar equivalents for fruit extracts or purified pigments,respectively.Cyclic Voltammetry. A 100 íM solution of either betanin orindicaxanthin in PBS was placed in a cyclic voltammeter cell, equippedwith a working electrode (3.3 mm in diameter, glassy carbon), areference electrode (Ag/AgCl), and an auxiliary electrode (platinumwire). The potential was applied linearly to the working electrode at aconstant rate (50 mV/s) toward the positive potential (evaluation ofreducing equivalents). An electrochemical working station, CV-50W(Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN), was used. During operationof the CV, a potential current curve was recorded (cyclic voltammo-gram).Copper Interaction Studies. The absorption spectra of purifiedbetalains (2 íM in saline) were recorded between 350 and 650 nm.Scans with 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 íM CuSO4 were taken and comparedwith the spectrum of betalain alone. The effect of 2.5-fold excess EDTAconcentration on the betalain-copper complex was examined.Statistical Analysis. Conventional methods were used for calculationof means and standard deviations. Comparison between individual groupmeans was performed by unpaired Student’s t test.RESULTSPigments and Vitamin C from Opuntia ficus indica. Theyellow indicaxanthin and the purple-red betanin are the char-acteristic pigments of the prickly pear. Spectrophotometricquantitation of these betalains has been reported for the yellow(12) and red (11, 12) fruits. While measuring the pigments inthe methanolic extracts from the white cultivar, we also re-evaluated betanin and indicaxanthin in the red and yellow ones,by considering eq 1 to correct for the strong interference ofbetanin on the spectrophotometric indicaxanthin quantitation.The yellow cultivar shows the highest content of betalains,indicaxanthin accounting for 89% of the pigments. Betaninappears most concentrated in the red cultivar, accounting forabout 66% of the betalains. Finally, the white cultivar showsthe lowest content of betalains, and contains almost exclusivelyindicaxanthin (Table 1).The amount of vitamin C in the aqueous extracts was similarfor the three cultivars (Table 1).The presence of polyphenols in the three cultivars of pricklypear was also checked. Spectral analysis of ethyl acetate extractsfrom the methanolic samples showed a small absorbance peakat 360 nm only in the extract from the red fruit, indicating thepresence of flavonols (not shown). Using quercetin as a standard,an amount as low as 237 ( 20 ng of flavonols/100 g of pulp(n ) 4) was calculated from the absorbance peak.Antioxidant Capacity of Prickly Pear Fruit Extracts.Several approaches, in solution and in biological models, havebeen used to investigate the antioxidant potential of the pricklypear fruit. Hydrophilic extracts from the three cultivars weresubmitted to the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay (25),and the activities of the extracts, expressed as Trolox equiva-lents, are reported in Table 2. On the basis of fresh weight, thetotal radical-scavenging ability of the methanolic extracts fromthe yellow fruit is significantly higher than the activity of thered and white ones.Red blood cells exposed to organic hydroperoxides representa useful model to study membrane lipid oxidation (26, 27).When RBCs (1% HT) were incubated with 50 íM tert-butylhydroperoxide, time-dependent formation of MDA was ob-served, which reached a maximum value of 1.4 ( 0.2 nmol/106 cells after a 4-h incubation (not shown). Methanolic extractsfrom 1 to 5 mg of edible pulp inhibited the MDA formed in 4h in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2). As a comparison,the antioxidant activity of 0.1-0.5 íM R-tocopherol wasassayed in the same system. Using R-tocopherol as a reference,the white cultivar appeared as the most effective at inhibitinglipid oxidation, the extract from 1 mg fresh pulp being aseffective as 0.2 íM R-tocopherol. Similar amounts of extractsfrom the red and yellow cultivars showed an antioxidant activitycomparable to that of 0.13 íM R-tocopherol (Figure 2).Finally, the effect of methanolic extracts from 5 mg of ediblepulp on the time course of the CD hydroperoxide productionin human LDL, submitted to either Cu2+- or AAPH-mediatedoxidation, was investigated. Figure 3 shows a typical experi-ment. In both models, the white cultivar was the most effectiveat enhancing the oxidation resistance, i.e., elongating the lagphase, followed by the red and the yellow ones. A concentration-dependent elongation of the lag phase was observed with theextracts from 1 to 5 mg of edible pulp (Figure 3 insets).Reducing Properties of Purified Betanin and Indicaxan-thin. The radical-scavenging capacity of purified betanin andindicaxanthin was assessed by the interaction of either betaninor indicaxanthin with the ABTS cation radical, in comparisonTable 1.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 50, No. 23, 2002 6897with Trolox. Both betalains were highly effective, with betaninmore active than indicaxanthin (Table 2).The oxidation potentials of betanin and indicaxanthin wereevaluated by CV. The cyclic voltammogram for the twopigments shows two and three anodic waves for indicaxanthinand betanin, respectively, indicating that both are able to donatetheir electrons (Figure 4). Differential pulse voltammetrymeasurements, which were conducted in order to increase thesensitivity, show three anodic waves for betanin and two anodicwaves for indicaxanthin. The peak potentials [Ep(a)s] indicatingthe reducing power are 404, 616, and 998 mV for betanin, whilefor indicaxanthin the values are 611 and 895 mV. The shape ofthe voltammetric waves toward the negative potential indicatesthat both compounds are irreversibly oxidized and their productscan no longer accept electrons.Copper Interactions. The interaction of either betanin orindicaxanthin with Cu2+ ions was assessed by visible spectros-copy at pH 7.4. A stepwise increment of CuSO4 concentrationcaused a shift in the absorption peak of betanin but did not haveany effect on the absorption of indicaxanthin. The results areshown in Table 3. Interactions of Cu2+ ions with betanin (2íM) at 0.5:1 to 2:1 ratios produced a progressive hypsochromicshift from 536 to 520 nm, which did not vary with furtherincrements of CuSO4 (4:1 ratio). On addition of 20 íM EDTA,the original spectrum was recovered (Figure 5).DISCUSSIONMuch research in recent decades has focused on the occur-rence of antioxidant molecules, to find a link between diets richin fruits and vegetables and the onset and/or prevention of anumber of oxidative stress-related diseases (28-31). Recentresults showing that the regular ingestion of prickly pearcladodes is effective in lowering oxidation injury (32) suggestthat there are effective antioxidant components in the edibletender stems of the plant. This study investigated, for the firsttime, the antioxidant capacity of the prickly pear fruit. Here weprovide evidence that the aqueous extracts from the red, yellow,and white fruits from Sicilian cultivars possess a markedantioxidant activity.Figure 2.

Human RBCs(HT 1%) were incubated with 50 íM tert-butyl hydroperoxide at 37 °Cfor 4 h in the absence (control) or in the presence of either R-tocopherol(O) or methanolic extract of edible pulp from white (b), yellow (2), andred (9) cultivars. MDA formation was determined as described in Materialsand Methods and expressed as a percentage of the control. Each valueis the mean ± SD of four determinations, performed in duplicate, withfour lots of fruits.Figure 3.

Food Chem., Vol. 50, No. 23, 2002 Butera et al.Polyphenols are currently recognized as bioactive componentsof vegetables and fruits with antioxidant properties (4-6). Ouranalysis provided evidence that negligible amounts of poly-phenols occur only in the red cultivar. As far as we know,dihydroquercetin and dihydrokaempferol have been identifiedby spectroscopic methods in the Opuntia ficus indica var.saboten, though the amounts have not been reported (33).Betanin, a betalain pigment, has recently been shown as anantioxidant in a number of model systems of lipid oxidation(17). Betalains such as betacyanins and betaxanthins occur in anumber of natural sources; however, prickly pears, beets, andthe fruit from vine cactus are the only foods containing thisclass of compounds (22, 34, 35). Consistent with the results ofothers (11, 12), we found that betanin and indicaxantin are themain betalain pigments of the prickly pear. The yellow cultivarexhibits the highest amount of betalains, followed by the redand the white cultivars. The purple-red betanin was negligiblein the white fruit, while the ratio betanin/indicaxanthin variedfrom 1:8 (w:w) in the yellow fruit to 2:1 (w:w) in the red one.Other spectrophotometric measurements reported for the yellow(12) and the red cultivars (11, 12) do not appear to be inagreement with our findings. In particular, the ratio betanin/indicaxanthin in the red cultivar has been reported as 1:3(w:w) (11) or 2:3 (w:w) (12). This could not be consideredcorrect. The application of the eq 1, developed by consideringthe overlapping of betanin absorbance, may be recommendedfor the spectrophotometric evaluation of indicaxanthin insamples containing both pigments.A global picture of the antioxidant potential of the water-soluble components of the prickly pear was achieved bymeasuring the ability of the methanolic extracts from the threecultivars to scavenge the ABTS cation radical in comparisonwith Trolox, the water-soluble analogue of vitamin E. The quitehigh values measured with the three cultivars suggest thepresence of very effective electron donors and/or H-atom donors.In accordance with the results of others (36), the prickly pearfruit appears to be a good source of vitamin C. Nevertheless,since the antioxidant capacity of 1.0 ímol of vitamin C is 0.99Trolox equivalents (37), the amount of vitamin C in the samplesFigure 4. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms of betanin andindicaxanthin. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out asdescribed in Methods.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 50, No. 23, 2002 6899may account for only 30-40% of the total antioxidant activityof the fruit extracts. Other water-soluble compounds, includingbetalain pigments, may be considered. Our measurements withpurified betanin and indicaxanthin provided evidence that bothcompounds have a marked antiradical activity against the ABTScation radical, which may support a major role for betanin andindicaxanthin in the observed activity of the fruit extracts. Higheractivity of betanin with respect to indicaxanthin was measuredin the ABTS assay. The monophenol nature of betanin andreducing intermediates during the oxidation process (38, 39)may confer the molecule a higher H-atom or electron donationpotential. This appears also to be in agreement with the observedredox potential determined for the two compounds by cyclicvoltammetry. Interactions between the two pigments can alsobe considered to account for the observed activity of the crudeextracts.The antioxidant potentials of vegetables and fruits measuredby the ABTS assay are quite consistent with those measuredby the ORAC assay (40). On this basis, the total antioxidantcapacity of the methanolic extracts of the prickly pear fruitsappears to be more than 2-fold that measured for pear, apple,tomato, banana, and white grape, and it is of the same order aspink grapefruit, red grape, and orange (41).Methanolic extracts from the prickly pear fruits were foundto be able to inhibit the organic hydroperoxide-stimulated redcell membrane oxidation. In addition, the pulp extracts inhibitedboth metal-dependent and -independent LDL oxidation. Al-though the antioxidant contribution of other compounds in theextracts cannot be ruled out, the observed activities of purifiedbetalains suggest that these pigments may play a significant rolein preventing lipid oxidation in our model systems. Due to theinteractions between betanin and copper ions, metal chelation,or some interference with binding of copper ions to the apo-B(42), could play some role in the protection of the Cu2+-mediated oxidation of LDL by betanin-containing extracts.However, the marked antioxidant activity of the extracts in allmodels of lipid oxidation, including the AAPH-dependent LDLoxidation and the tert-butyl hydroperoxide-stimulated lipidoxidation in red blood cells, suggests that one or more of thecomponents may act as efficient scavengers of oxygen-centeredradicals. According to the cyclic voltammetry measurements,the reduction potential of both betanin and indicaxanthin wouldallow these compounds to reduce either lipoperoxyl or alkoxylradicals (42). In addition, the voltammogram showed that theoxidized species from both pigments are no longer capable ofrecapturing electrons, i.e., becoming oxidants. It can also bementioned that betalains are a class of cationized molecules withaffinity for membrane moieties (17). This may be an excellentattribute for the antioxidant properties of mixtures containingthese compounds.Though the ABTS assay and the cyclic voltammetry mea-surements showed that indicaxanthin is a less potent reducingcompound than betanin, it seems interesting that the methanolicextract from the white cultivar, virtually lacking betanin,exhibited the highest protective action in all models of lipidoxidation. This may suggest advantageous interactions ofindicaxanthin in biological moieties. The redox chemistry andradical scavenging properties of indicaxanthin deserve to bemore thoroughly investigated.In conclusion, while showing that the aqueous extracts fromthe prickly pear fruit have a marked antioxidant activity in bothchemical and biological systems in vitro, our findings suggestthat the betalain pigments may be important antioxidantcomponents to account for the observed activity. Betaninbioavailability has been explored (17). However, the presentfindings are not expected to be directly representative ofbiological effects because the bioavailability of other betalainpigments, as well as their in vivo interactions and metabolism,is not known. Our results, however, would encourage nutritionalstudies to assess the importance of prickly pear in the mainte-nance of health and disease prevention. A trial is currently inprogress to study the eventual protection of the endogenousantioxidant systems and/or reduction of oxidative stress by theregular ingestion of prickly pear fruits.ABBREVIATIONS USEDABTS, [2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)]diammonium salt; TEP, 1,1,3-tetraethoxypropane; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride; BHT, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol; Trolox, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic acid; CD, conjugated diene; CV, cyclicvoltammetry; DPV, differential pulse voltammetry; EDTA,ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; HPLC, high-performance liquidchromatography; LDL, low-density lipoproteins; MDA, mal-ondialdehyde; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RBCs, red bloodcells.LITERATURE CITED(1) Rice-Evans, C.
