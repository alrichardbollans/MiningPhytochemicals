Urine and serum samples were 38 collected at distinct postprandial time points up to 48 h, and analyzed by LC-HR-MS untargeted 39 metabolomics. Hypaphorine, trigonelline, several small peptides and polyphenol-derived 40 metabolites proved to be the most discriminating urinary metabolites. Two arginine-related 41 compounds, dopamine sulfate and epicatechin metabolites, with their microbial derivatives, were 42 identified only after intake of lentils, whereas protocatechuic acid was identified only after 43 consumption of chickpeas. Urinary hydroxyjasmonic and hydroxydihydrojasmonic acids, as well 44 as serum pipecolic acid and methylcysteine, were found after white bean consumption. Most of 45 the metabolites identified in the postprandial study were replicated as discriminants in 24 h urine 46 samples, demonstrating that in this case the use of a single, noninvasive sample was suitable for 47 revealing the consumption of pulses. 48 Conclusions: The results of the present untargeted metabolomics work revealed a broad list of 49 metabolites that are candidates for use as biomarkers of pulse intake. Further studies are needed 50 to validate these BFIs and to find the best combinations of them to boost their specificity.5152Page 5 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review453 1. INTRODUCTION54 Pulses refer to the edible nonoil dried seeds of legumes, such as lentils, chickpeas, dry beans 55 and dry peas. They present a unique nutritional value characterized by a high content of protein, 56 fiber and a variety of phytochemicals, as well as by a low glycemic index. Consumption of pulses 57 has been associated with beneficial effects on human health. In fact, regular pulse consumption 58 has been associated with lower body weight [1], blood pressure [2] and LDL cholesterol [3], as well 59 as with an improvement in markers of glycemic control [4]. In recent years the promotion of their 60 consumption has been prioritized by a wide range of public and private stakeholders culminating 61 in the declaration of the year 2016 as the International Year of Pulses by the General Assembly of 62 the United Nations, which was coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 63 United Nations. 64 To study in depth the effects of these foods and to gain more insight into the molecular 65 mechanisms by which they act, a precise measurement of food intake is required. Here, 66 biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) have emerged as a promising tool for correctly assessing food 67 intake [5]. To date, only a limited number of foods have been associated with validated BFIs, but 68 pulses are not among them, since only a few studies dealing with this topic have been recently 69 published [6–11]. The first of them was focused on the quantification of kaempferol in urine after 70 bean consumption [6]. However, this compound is present in a wide range of vegetables [12]. 71 Results from another human study suggested serum pipecolic acid and S-methylcysteine as 72 biomarkers of dry bean consumption [7]. Animal studies reported an increase in the urinary 73 excretion of trigonelline, homoeridictyol chalcone and two peptides after a bean-based diet in 74 dogs [8], and increased urinary excretions of different species of dipeptides, as well as arginine-75 related metabolites in hypertensive rats fed with lentils [9]. More recently our research group 76 published two human studies applying untargeted NMR experiments, one in an observational Page 6 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review577 framework [10] while the other was a postprandial controlled intervention study [11]. The first 78 study showed that pulse consumers had higher urinary excretions of different metabolites related 79 to choline, protein and energy metabolism [10], whereas the results of the second study suggested 80 trigonelline, 3-methylhistidine, dimethylglycine, TMA, glutamine, choline, lysine and histidine 81 as candidate biomarkers of pulse intake [11]. However, as the authors pointed out, these 82 metabolites are not highly specific to pulse consumption.83 In light of this scarcity of knowledge regarding biomarkers of pulse consumption, the aim of 84 the present study was to assess the metabolic fingerprint of urine and serum associated with their 85 intake in order to further identify reliable BFIs of the most commonly consumed types of pulses 86 (i.e. lentils, chickpeas and dry beans) using an LC-MS untargeted metabolomics approach. This 87 technique enables the detection of a wide range of metabolites even at low concentrations while 88 biosamples selected for analysis usually carry a large amount of dietary information. This 89 research was developed within the same context of the NMR study mentioned before [11]. In 90 addition to analyzing the nutrikinetic profiles in urine and serum, in this study we aimed to go 91 one step further and develop a complementary experiment with pooled urinary samples. This was 92 focused on a comparision of the data provided by the nutrikinetic profile with the 6 h and 24 h 93 pooled urine samples to check the overlapping information. The aforementioned experiment was 94 carried out in order (1) to get an overview of the postprandrial impact of the evaluated foods 95 without the interference of any additional intake (6 h pools), and (2) to evaluate the information 96 provided by a simpler, less expensive and more easily available type of sample such as the 24 h 97 urine pool.98Page 7 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review699 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS100 2.1. Study design 101 The design of this study (Figure 1) has been defined within the frame of the European JPI-102 funded project “Food Biomarker Alliance” (FoodBAll) [13]. In fact, this is one of the seven 103 standardized postprandial intervention studies designed to discover new potential food intake 104 biomarkers for a broad range of common foods. Our study was focused on different types of the 105 most commonly consumed kinds of pulses, i.e. lentils, chickpeas and white beans, using white 106 pasta as the control food. The study was registered at the ISRCTN registry with the code 107 ISRCTN17200423. Details of this randomized, controlled, crossover study have been reported 108 previously [11] and are listed in the Supporting Information. The clinical intervention was 109 approved by the Bioethical Committee of the University of Barcelona (ref: IRB00003099) and 110 followed Helsinki Declaration guidelines.111 A total of 84 subjects expressed their interest in participating in this study, of whom 31 were 112 screened. Twenty-six of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 14 were enrolled since they were 113 the ones that finally fully agreed to participate in the study, with 11 (four men and seven women) 114 completing the study in a crossover design with lentils, chickpeas and pasta (Figure S1). A 115 subgroup of eight participants underwent the fourth intervention with white beans, which was 116 scheduled later. The subjects were on average 28 ± 6 years old (range: 19‒37) and had a BMI of 117 23.8 ± 3.6 kg/m2 (range: 18.6‒28.9).118119 2.2. Analysis of food samples 120 Test foods were freeze-dried in the study center, shipped to the analytical lab on dry ice and 121 stored at -80 °C before further peparation. Twenty mg of each sample were extracted twice with 122 methanol/tert-butyl methyl ether first and methanol/water afterwards.

Untargeted analyses were performed by LC-MS (results previously 125 published by Llorach et al.[14]) and also using a comprehensive two-dimensional gas 126 chromatography mass spectrometry (GC×GC-MS) system described elsewhere [15]. Data 127 processing was done using the SquareDance workflow developed for GC×GC-qMS data sets [16] . 128 Further details of sample preparation and the analytical procedure are provided in the Supporting 129 Information. Automated compound annotation was performed using an in-house spectral library 130 with fatty acid methyl esters-based retention indices. Finally, the annotation was manually 131 verified by matching against the National Institute of Standards and Technology v14 library, the 132 Fiehn library and the Golm Metabolome Database. The compounds identified in the four food 133 products through the analyses with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass 134 spectrometry are listed in Table S2.135136 2.3. Untargeted metabolomics experiments on biological samples137 Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed in accordance with previously validated 138 methodologies [17]. Briefly, urine samples were diluted with a series of internal and external 139 standards in pure methanol and in Milli-Q water, whereas serum samples were prepared using 140 Ostro plates. Afterwards, all samples were subjected to high-throughput metabolomics analysis 141 using a reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution Orbitrap mass 142 spectrometer. Later, acquired data were processed using the XCMS package in the R platform. A 143 detailed description of these procedures, together with an exhaustive explanation about statistical 144 analysis and metabolite identification, is given in Supporting Information (section “Untargeted 145 metabolomics experiments on biological samples”).146Page 9 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review8147 3. RESULTS148 3.1. Identification of metabolites associated with legume consumption in the nutrikinetic 149 study150 Data adquired in this study showed good analytical performance. In-depth information about 151 the quality of acquired data, as well as verification of data processing, is provided in the section 152 “Data acquisition quality” in Supporting Information. After the processing of the raw MS data, 153 further filtration steps were applied to the obtained data sets in order to reduce the amount of 154 noisy and/or irrelevant features. The number of features in both the original and filtered data sets 155 can be found in Supporting Information (“Data filtering” section). Finally, before proceeding 156 with the feature selection, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on each data set to 157 explore trends in the data. A complete description of these results and their interpretation is 158 provided in the section “Unsupervised multivariate analysis” in Supporting Information.159 Among all the features retained after data filtering, 320 met the first selection requirement, 160 based on their nutrikinetic curve behavior (see Supporting Information for futher details). Of 161 these, 265 were found to be statistically significant (adjusted p-value < 0.05 of AUCs), 151 of 162 which were assigned to one of the 54 identified metabolites (Table 1), whereas the rest remained 163 unknown. Out of the 54 identified metabolites, 12 were identified at level I, 29 at level II and 13 164 at level III. Identified compounds were categorized into several groups taking into consideration 165 information on the chemical class of their precursors (metabolites) or their common pathways of 166 origin (Figure S5): small peptides, flavan-3-ol-derived metabolites, other polyphenol-derived 167 metabolites, fatty acids, other food-derived metabolites and endogenous metabolites. A detailed 168 description of the identification of discriminant metabolites is provided in the section 169 “Identification of discriminating metabolites” in the Supporting Information, and information 170 regarding their fragmentation spectra is given in Table S5. The responses of a selected group of Page 10 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review9171 characteristic metabolites are depicted in Figure 2, while Figure S6 includes the kinetic curves of 172 all identified metabolites. All plots were constructed with the MS response (peak area) of the 173 most intensive feature of each metabolite. 174175 3.2. Experiment on pooled samples176 In order to compare the data provided by nutrikinetic profiles and a simpler type of sample 177 such as 24 h urine, an additional experiment was performed. This was done with the aim of 178 checking the overlapping information between these types of samples. Additionally, 6 h urine 179 pools were also analyzed since during the first 6 hours volunteers only ingested the test meal (i.e. 180 this pool included samples collected 1h, 2h, 4h and 6h after consuming the study food, Figure 1). 181 In both cases, most of the identified urinary metabolites in the nutrikinetic experiments were also 182 observed as being discriminant in both types of pooled samples (Table S6 and Figure S7). This 183 demonstrates that in this case using a simpler type of sample (in that it is not required for the 184 study volunteer to collect the samples in different containers) is also useful for observing the 185 BFIs of pulse consumption. This has important connotations since 24 h urinary samples are 186 usually collected in long intervention and epidemiological studies (although unfortunately some 187 of them only have available spot urine instead of 24 h urine samples). Furthermore, the HCA 188 (Figure 3) demonstrated that, although not all statistically significant features were annotated, the 189 information on those already assigned to one of the identified metabolites allowed a good sample 190 clustering performance.191192 4. DISCUSSION193 In this work, several metabolites were found to be associated with the intake of some of the 194 most widely consumed types of pulses. They were identified using liquid chromatography Page 11 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review10195 coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Most of these metabolites are candidates as BFIs 196 for this food group since they showed increased urinary and/or serum concentrations after the 197 consumption of at least one type of pulse, while the values observed after the consumption of the 198 control food (pasta) were negligible. It was difficult to find biomarkers exclusively for one type 199 of pulse, as most of them were common to at least two or three pulse types. The exceptions were 200 flavan-3-ol-derived metabolites (M27‒M31), two arginine-related compounds (M25 and M26) 201 and dopamine sulfate (M43), which appeared to be specific for lentil intake in urine samples, 202 whereas protocatechuic acid glucoside (M37) and ascorbic acid (M42) were elevated after the 203 consumption of chickpeas. Hydrojasmonic (M39) and two hydroxydihydrojasmonic (M40 and 204 M41) acids were characteristic of white bean intake. In serum samples, methylcysteine (M45) 205 and pipecolic acid (M46) also resulted in particular from white bean consumption, and in both 206 types of biosamples hypaphorine (M44) was discriminant for chickpeas and lentils. Two of the 207 identified BFIs (i.e. methylcysteine and pipecolic acid) were detected as such in the test food to 208 which they were assigned as markers (Table S2). This observation indicates that they were most 209 likely nonmetabolized or not fully metabolized, suggesting that they would not be subject to 210 substantial interindividual differences.211212 4.1. BFI for lentils213 The results for flavan-3-ol-derived metabolites are consistent with the analyses of test foods, 214 which showed that catechins were particular to lentils (Table S2). They were observed only in 215 urine and their presence is due to the metabolism of catechins and proanthocyanidins by host and 216 by intestinal microbiota. The urine integrated intensity-time curves clearly show two distinct 217 nutrikinetic patterns, as already reported in another independent postprandrial dietary intervention 218 [17]. On the one hand, (epi)catechin sulfate (M27) reached its maximum urinary levels within the Page 12 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review11219 first 2‒4 h post-consumption followed by a rapid decrease within the next few hours. This 220 behavior suggests that this compound is probably absorbed in the upper part of the 221 gastrointestinal tract with little or no contribution from the microbiota. On the other hand, the 222 four valerolactone-derived metabolites (M28‒M31) were characterized by a delayed appearance 223 in urine. Their levels started to increase 4 h after consumption of lentils, reaching the maximum 224 levels after 12 h, still being significantly higher after 24 h and reaching the baseline values within 225 48 h. This performance suggests a prolonged metabolism throughout the large intestine with the 226 involvement of the microbiota. These profiles are in good agreement with previous studies 227 reporting the presence of (epi)catechin and valerolactone conjugates in urine [17]. This suggests 228 that the former may only be useful as a BFI when 24 h urine is available, whereas the others 229 could be more useful as BFIs when only spot urines are accessible. However, increases in urinary 230 excretions after the intake of other catechin- and proanthocyanidin-rich foods such as tea, cocoa 231 and grape products have also been observed in previous studies [18], thereby limiting their 232 specificity as candidate BFIs of lentils. Additionally, hydroxy- and oxoarginine (M25 and M26) 233 urinary levels also increased with the intake of lentils. Maximum excretions of these compounds 234 were observed 4 and 6 hours, respectively, after intake of lentils, although differences were 235 observed from the first few hours until 48 h post-consumption (Table 1). Hydroxyarginine is a 236 free nonprotein amino acid particular to lentils [9], and oxoarginine is a metabolite of the arginine 237 pathway recently associated with lentil consumption [9]. Therefore, they are interesting indicators 238 of lentil intake. Additionally, it has been suggested that they could contribute to the blood 239 pressure-lowering effects associated with the consumption of lentils through an increase in the 240 production of nitric oxide [9]. Due to the well-known degradation of the guanidino group during 241 trimethylsilylation prior to GC×GC-MS analysis, the presence (or abundance) of arginine and 242 related compounds in the test foods could not be determined [19]. An increased urinary excretion Page 13 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review12243 of dopamine sulfate (M43, the predominant form of dopamine in the circulation) was also 244 particularly noticeable after the consumption of lentils. It has already been reported that it is 245 largely affected by meal consumption, coming from the intake of dopamine, dopamine sulfate or 246 L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the conversion of dietary tyramine to dopamine, the action 247 of tyrosinase to produce L-DOPA in the gastrointestinal lumen, or an increased release and 248 metabolism of endogenous dopamine in gastrointestinal lining cells [20]. Very recently, dopamine 249 sulfate was found to be among the BFIs best predicting the intake of banana [21].250251 4.2. BFI for chickpeas252 Ascorbic acid (M42) appeared as a discriminant compound for chickpea consumption during 253 the period 4 h to 6 h post-intake. In line with that, its oxidation product, dehydroascorbic acid, 254 was only detected in high amounts in chickpeas (Table S2). However, ascorbic acid cannot be 255 considered a compound from chickpeas per se, since it is employed as a food additive. 256 Furthermore, since it is widely used in the food industry as a stabilizing agent, it lacks the 257 specificity to be used as a BFI and was not further investigated.258259 4.3. BFI for white beans260 Methylcysteine (M45) and pipecolic acid (M46) appeared in serum samples particularly after 261 white bean intake. Their levels were already significantly increased 1 h post-consumption and 262 remained as such until the period 24 h‒48 h (Table 1, Figure S7a). In accordance with this 263 observation, the serum levels of pipecolic acid and methylcysteine have already been proposed as 264 potential biomarkers of dry bean consumption [7]. They are common nonprotein nitrogen 265 components of the Phaseolus vulgaris species [22]. Specifically, whereas methylcysteine is not 266 influenced by microbial metabolism, pipecolic acid has been reported to be a product of Page 14 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review13267 microbial metabolism derived from lysine and has been described as a precursor of microbial 268 compounds with anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antibiotic properties [7]. On the other hand, 269 three jasmonic derivatives (M39‒M41) appeared to be particular to white bean intake. They are 270 lipid-derived phytohormones generated in plants as a response to stress and their presence has 271 been described in different varieties and cultivars of Vicia faba beans [23].272273 4.4. BFI for legumes274 As legumes are an important food source of proteins, amino acid-derived metabolites could be 275 indicators of their consumption. Indeed, we observed higher serum and/or urinary levels of 276 several species of di- and tripeptides (M01‒M17). When differences among the different types of 277 legumes were observed, in most cases chickpeas were among the types that resulted in the 278 highest concentrations. This could have been related to the fact that chickpeas could have a 279 higher amount of protein in their composition, but this did not turn out to be the case when we 280 consulted the nutritional composition of the foods used [11]. These compounds may indicate that 281 they are directly excreted in urine after pulse intake, and/or may represent proteolytic breakdown 282 products of larger proteins present in these food sources. Most of the peptides were aspartyl-283 containing compounds. Interestingly, in another study developed within the FoodBAll project but 284 focused on meat biomarkers, a series of small peptides were also identified as BFIs. However, in 285 that case these were hydroxyproline-containing di- and tripeptides [24] and none of them were in 286 line with the present study where a completely different protein-based food was consumed.287 Another interesting discriminant compound was hypaphorine (M44), which is also referred to 288 as tryptophan betaine or lenticin. This last nomenclature was assigned since it is found in lentils 289 [25,26], althougth it has also been reported in chickpeas [27]. It is an indole alkaloid composed of 290 tryptophan and three methyls. In the present study, it has been observed as being discriminant for Page 15 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review14291 the consumption of chickpeas and lentils both in serum and urine biofluids. In serum it has been 292 observed as discriminant in the first hour after consumption, peaking 4‒6 h after consumption 293 and resulting in a prolonged disappearance in both biofluids, indicating a slow excretion or 294 metabolism. However, the complete clearance of its metabolism could not be estimated since this 295 metabolite was still detected during the 24‒48 h period, when the last sample was collected. It 296 has been correlated with nut intake in different cross-sectional studies [28–31], and it has also been 297 associated with the Mediterranean diet [32] and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 298 (DASH) [33] dietary patterns. Additionally, a study focused on peanut consumption also reported 299 its presence in the breast milk of lactating women [34]. Curiously, it has been positively associated 300 with homocysteine levels after a Mediterranean-based dietary treatment in subjects with 301 metabolic syndrome features [32]. Although it has been shown to be a compound with 302 neurological and glucose-lowering effects in rodents, its potential functional role in humans 303 remains to be addressed.304 In parallel and in agreement with the results observed in our NMR experiments [11], urinary 305 levels of trigonelline (M47) were also increased after intake of the three different types of pulses. 306 In this case, urinary trigonelline achieved higher levels after the intake of white beans followed 307 by chickpeas and lentils, reflecting the different amounts observed in their composition [11] and, 308 therefore, suggesting a possible dose-response connection. Interestingly, this was also described 309 after bean consumption in the two independent untargeted studies previously published [7,8]. 310 However, this alkaloid has also been proposed as a BFI of coffee intake [35]. Therefore, this lack 311 of specificity could limit its use as a single BFI, but we hypothesize that it could be considered 312 within a multi-metabolite biomarker panel together with some of the other discriminating 313 metabolites also observed in this study [18]. For example, combined with flavan-3-ol-derived Page 16 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review15314 metabolites, arginine-related compounds and hypaphorine increase the specificity for monitoring 315 lentil consumption. 316 Other metabolites whose amounts were increased in urine after pulse intake were tentatively 317 identified as phloroglucinol glucuronide (M32) and phloroglucinol sulfate (M33). Both are 318 metabolites containing benzoyl groups, probably generated by microbial degradation of 319 polyphenols contained in pulses, and therefore reflecting polyphenol metabolite cleavage 320 products of gut microbiota action.321322 4.5. Endogenous metabolites323 Major increases in glucuronidated forms of dicarboxylic fatty acids (i.e. dodecanedioic acid 324 glucuronide, M51, and tretradecanedioic acid glucuronide, M53) and hydroxy fatty acids (i.e. 325 dihydroxydecanoic acid glucuronide, M50, and hydroxydodecadienoic acid glucuronide, M52) 326 were observed after pasta intake (used as control food) when compared with the consumption of 327 the other types of pulses. Given the type of metabolites (glucuronidated medium-chain fatty 328 acids), these metabolites probably reflect a differential endogenous response rather than being a 329 metabolite from an exogenous food compound (also bearing in mind that pasta was not the food 330 with the highest fat content [11]). Therefore, this could indicate a different response related to lipid 331 metabolism. For example, in the case of dicarboxylic fatty acids, they probably reflect a shift 332 from a reduced β-oxidation toward an enhanced ω-oxidation of fatty acids since dicarboxylic 333 fatty acids are enhanced when there is a deficiency in fatty acid oxidation or when β-oxidation is 334 overwhelmed [36]. Additionally, dihydroxydecanoic acid is an intermediate from the ω-oxidation 335 of hydroxydecanoic acid to hydroxydecanedioic acid [37], and 4-hydroxydodecadienoic acid has 336 also been previously detected in human urine and measured in higher amounts in situations 337 characterized by the presence of oxidative stress such as that due to aging and diabetes [38]. Given Page 17 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review16338 that insulin resistance is mediated by a dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism [39] and that pulse 339 consumption has been associated with both better glycemic control [4] and healthier blood lipid 340 levels [3], the differential urinary levels of these metabolites could be related to an alteration in the 341 corresponding pathways manifested early postprandially that could mediate these beneficial 342 effects already observed in the aforementioned clinical outputs. However, given the design of the 343 current study, this is only a hypothesis of the underlying mechanisms, which should be verified in 344 further studies designed specifically for this purpose.345346 4.6. Strengths and weaknesses347 Most of the BFIs identified in urinary samples from the kinetic study were replicated as 348 discriminant metabolites in 24 h pooled urine. The collection of this type of sample is much 349 simpler than the methodology that has to be used for performing a nutrikinetic study. 350 Additionally, in several epidemiological and intervention studies this type of sample is the one 351 collected by the researchers. Therefore, our observation has important connotations for the future, 352 since it demonstrates that with this type of sample we can reach the same conclusions. 353 Additionally, further analyses of 24 h urine samples available in biobanks from previous studies 354 with legumes will be able to be carried out in order to see which of these candidate BFIs for 355 legumes are replicated in independent studies. 356 Given that in the already available scientific bibliography none of the identified metabolites 357 were highly specific, further research focused on their combination is required in order to 358 evaluate their robustness and usefulness as candidate BFIs of these foods.359 The crossover design of the present study allowed comparisons between the different meals on 360 a within-participant basis. This allowed a better evaluation of the treatment effect since each 361 participant served as its own control [40]. However, it was not the case with white beans, which Page 18 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review17362 were administered in the last phase for all volunteers. Further, an additional untargeted analysis 363 of the study foods helped us to find out whether the detected marker candidates were original 364 constituents of the test foods or resulted from host or microbial metabolism. 365 The study also has some additional weaknesses. Firstly, a full-confidence identification level 366 could not be reached for most of the differential metabolites as the corresponding chemical 367 standards were commercially unavailable. However, identifications at level II and III have also 368 provided interesting information that has allowed us to infer a biological interpretation of the 369 observed results of the present study. On the other hand, the highly controlled environment in 370 which the participants were involved throughout the study together with the high quantity of food 371 provided would have favored the observation of significant candidate BFIs. Therefore, some of 372 the candidate BFIs deciphered in the current study could not be replicated in other studies with 373 lower amounts of ingested food and/or where the background diet is not as controlled as in our 374 case [40]. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate the results deciphered by the present 375 analyses. Lastly, in this case, pasta was chosen as a control food since it is a low-polyphenol food 376 product, although other foods could also have been chosen instead of it.377378 4.7. Concluding remarks379 In conclusion, the results of the present untargeted metabolomics work revealed a long list of 380 metabolites that are candidates to be used as biomarkers of pulse intake. Flavan-3-ol-derived 381 metabolites and arginine-related compounds were found to be specific for lentils, whereas 382 protocatechuic acid glucoside was particular to chickpeas; methylcysteine and pipecolic, 383 hydroxyjasmonic and hydroxydihydrojasmoinic acids to white beans; and hypaphorine to 384 chickpeas and lentils. On the other hand, a wide range of peptides, trigonelline and some 385 polyphenol-derived metabolites appeared to be more generic indicators of pulse consumption.

Next, biological validation will be required to test these 390 candidate biomarkers in other populations with more individuals and under different 391 experimental conditions and even under free-living conditions.Page 20 of 34Wiley-VCHMolecular Nutrition and Food Research123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960For Peer Review19392 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS393 We would like to thank Jan Stanstrup for the development of the R scripts used for LCMS 394 data processing and Domenico Masuero, Silvia Remmert and Michael Meyer for their expert 395 technical assistance with this project.396  397 FUNDING398 This work was developed as part of the FoodBAll (Food Biomarker Alliance) project 399 supported within the European Joint Programming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” 400 granted by the Spanish National Grants from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 401 (MINECO, PCIN-2014-133; PCIN-2015-238) to Cristina Andres-Lacueva, by the German 402 Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL, grant no. 2814ERA03E) to Christoph H. 403 Weinert and by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR, CUP 404 D43C17000100006) to Fulvio Mattivi.
