Very few studies have been carried out on the chemical profile or the biological activity of the Braziliansavanna (Cerrado) species. In the study reported here, the allelopathic activity of AcOEt and MeOH extracts of leaves,stems, and roots from Ocotea pulchella NEES was evaluated. The extracts were assayed on etiolated wheat coleoptiles. TheAcOEt leaf extract was the most active and this was tested on standard target species (STS). Lycopersicon esculentum andLactuca sativa were the most sensitive species in this test. A total of eleven compounds have been isolated and characterized.Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 have not been identified previously from O. pulchella and ocoteol (9) is reported for the first timein the literature. Eight compounds were tested on wheat coleoptile growth, and spathulenol, benzyl salicylate, and benzylbenzoate showed the highest activities. These compounds showed inhibitory activity on L. esculentum. The values obtainedcorrespond to the activity exhibited by the extract and these compounds may therefore be responsible for the allelopathicactivity shown by O. pulchella.Keywords: Ocotea pulchella, Ocoteol, Allelopathic activity, Cerrado, Allelochemicals.IntroductionThe Cerrado (the Brazilian savanna) is one of the mostbiodiverse vegetation formations in Brazil and it hasexperienced significant deforestation and fragmentation.The Cerrado contains at least 12,000 higher plant speciesbut only a small fraction of these has been studied fromthe phytochemical viewpoint [1]. Allelochemicals arisefrom the secondary metabolism that operates in plant–plant interactions [2]. Furthermore, the distribution ofthese chemical compounds in plants is not uniform, eitherqualitatively or quantitatively, in space or time. Allelo-chemicals can be present in many parts of the plant,namely leaves, stems, roots, flowers, seeds, and bark.Under appropriate environmental conditions, these allelo-chemicals are released into the environment by volatiliza-tion, exudation from the roots, leaching from the aerialparts, and decomposition of plant remains. When thesecompounds are released into the environment they, ortheir degradation products [3], can have an effect on thegrowth and development of natural or implanted biologi-cal communities, either negatively or positively. Thus,these compounds can affect the development ofneighboring plants, mainly in the germination and thegrowth of shoots and roots [4].A knowledge of the main interactions between culti-vated plants and secondary compounds extracted fromnative plants can be relevant in the management of weedsin agricultural ecosystems [5].Weeds can be controlled using a combination of cultiva-tion practices, such as sowing rates, mechanical weeding,crop rotation. and the use of competitive crops [6]. The useof synthetic herbicides is, however, the main method ofweed control due to its high efficiency and practicality.Nevertheless, the intensive application of herbicides causessevere environmental damage and the evolution of herbi-cide-resistant weed populations [7]. Several factors maycause or accelerate the development of weed resistance tosynthetic herbicides and these include the biological fea-tures of the plants and the chemical properties of the herbi-cide. The continued use of the same herbicide, or one withthe same mode of action, is the main factor in the selectionof resistant varieties. New regulations have reduced thenumber of synthetic pesticides available in agriculture dueto the potential impact that they have on human health andthe environment [8]. Knowledge of the role of chemical© 2016 Wiley-VHCA AG, Z€urich DOI: 10.1002/cbdv.2015005011058 Chem. Biodiversity 2016, 13, 1058 – 1067compounds extracted from plants, and their negativeeffects on the development of weeds, is important in thesearch for natural allelochemicals and synthetic derivativesfor use as natural herbicides, since they have specific modesof action and are less damaging to the environment [9].Lauraceae is a family with 55 genera and about2500 – 3000 species of mostly tropical trees. Worldwide,this family is of considerable economic importancebecause it is used as a source of wood for construction(Nectandra, Ocotea, Persea spp.), as a crop (Persea ameri-cana) and to obtain flavors for the food industry, per-fumery, and medicines (Cinnamomum zeylanicum,C. cassia) [10][11]. The genus Ocotea (Lauraceae) iswidely represented in the American tropics with300 – 400 species and it is also present in Brazil withabout 150 species [12]. The large number of species in thegenus Ocotea has attracted the interest of Brazilianphytochemical researchers [13]. Some species of thisgenus are used in popular medicine due to their antirheu-matic, purgative, and tonic properties, and for the treat-ment of stomach disorders and abscesses [14], amongother uses. The Lauraceae family is known to containhigh levels of essential oils, which are mainly present inthe leaves and have different reported biological activities[12]. Other species are considered to be aromatic and theyare therefore used in perfumery and flavorings [15]. Theseoils have also shown herbicidal activity with inhibitoryeffects observed on germination, growth, and chlorophyllconcentration in the plant species studied as targets [16].Chemical studies carried out with species of the genusOcotea have often shown the presence of aporphine alka-loids [17], lignans and neolignans [18], tannins, steroids,triterpenes, and phenylpropanoids [19]. In a phytochemi-cal study on leaves of O. pulchella, it was found that leu-coanthocyanidins, glycosides, flavonoids, flavonols,steroids, triterpenes, and anthocyanin were present inaddition to the potential larvicidal, cytotoxic, and antioxi-dant properties [20]. To date, several compounds havebeen isolated from this plant and various biological activi-ties have been identified. O. pulchella is widely dis-tributed in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and differentextracts of this plant have also shown allelopathic activity,but the natural products responsible for the observedactivity have not been identified [21].The aim of the study described here was to determinethe compounds responsible for the allelopathic activity ofO. pulchella. In order to achieve this aim, a bioassay-guided isolation was carried out to identify the plant partand the extract that were the most allelopathic. Themajor components from this active extract were isolated,characterized, and tested in appropriate bioassays to iden-tify the metabolites responsible for the observed activity.Results and DiscussionDried leaves, stems, and roots of O. pulchella, wereextracted with AcOEt and MeOH, respectively. Theseextracts, at concentrations of 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/ml, weresubjected to an etiolated wheat coleoptile bioassay. Thisbioassay showed a higher inhibition by the AcOEt extractfrom leaves, with a value of nearly 60% at 0.8 mg/ml,whereas the effects of stem and root extracts was of littlesignificance when compared with that of the control. TheMeOH extracts from leaves, stems, and roots showed lowerlevels of inhibition than the AcOEt extracts, i.e., 20 – 40%at the highest concentration (0.8 mg/ml) (Fig. 1).The differences in the activity between the leaf, stem,and root extracts are consistent with literature data interms of the concentrations of allelochemicals in differentplant parts [22].The differences in the activity profiles between theMeOH and AcOEt extracts suggest that the most activemetabolites have a medium polarity. Moreover, the activ-ity profile of the AcOEt extract of leaves had a dose–re-sponse relationship in which an increase in theconcentration from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/ml resulted in anincrease of about 40% in inhibition (Fig. 1). Allelochemi-cals that typically have medium polarity belong to thegroups of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, and terpenoids[23]. As in the present study, Miranda et al. [24] foundgreater inhibition in wheat coleoptiles exposed to AcOEtextracts. Therefore, the AcOEt extract of leaves was eval-uated in a subsequent phytotoxicity bioassay.A phytotoxicity test on standard target species (cress,onion, lettuce, and tomato) was employed to assess thebioactivity of the AcOEt extract of leaves from O. pul-chella on the development of root, shoot, and seed germi-nation. The parameter that was most affected by theAcOEt extract of leaves was root length, with inhibitionvalues for Lycopersicon esculentum of around 65%. Inaddition, a dose-dependent inhibition was observed onthe root tomato seedlings tested (Fig. 2). The sensitivityof roots to allelochemicals can be explained by the factthat roots are the first parts of the plant to emerge andthey are in direct contact with the extracts, which can beabsorbed directly [25].In Lactuca sativa, the parameter that was affected themost was the root growth, with an inhibition of 45% atthe highest concentration (0.8 mg/ml). L. esculentum wasthe only species that was significantly affected in relationto the germination and development of root and stemupon exposure to the AcOEt extract (Fig. 2). Theobserved differences in susceptibility between the targetspecies are consistent with the literature data. Toleranceor resistance to allelochemicals may be specific and cer-tain species may have a greater sensitivity than others; forexample, lettuce (L. sativa L.) and tomato (L. esculentumL.) are bioindicators of allelopathic activity.The herbicidal potential of the genus Ocotea hasalready been identified by other researchers. For example,Borges et al. [16] found that aqueous extracts ofOcotea odoriferous significantly reduced the germination,root growth, and chlorophyll content of Sorghum bicolorL. species.Chem. Biodiversity 2016, 13, 1058 – 1067 1059© 2016 Wiley-VHCA AG, Z€urich www.cb.wiley.comThe AcOEt extract of leaves was selected for furtherstudy. This extract was purified by chromatography andthe following allelochemicals were characterized: fivesesquiterpenes (1 – 5), one fatty acid (6), two flavonoids(7 and 8), one phenylethanoid glucoside (9), two aromaticesters (10 and 11), and two sugars (12 and 13). The iso-lated compounds were identified by comparison of theirspectroscopic data (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, IR, and MS)with those reported in the literature for 1b,6a-dihydroxy-eudesm-4(5)-ene (1) [26]; 1b-hydroxyeudesma-5,11-diene(2) [27]; T-cadinol (3) [28]; loliolide (4) [29]; spathulenol(5) [30]; dimorphecolic acid (6) [31]; afzelin (7) [32];kaempferol-40-O-rhamnopyranoside (8) [33]; benzylsalicylate (10); benzyl benzoate (11) [34]; both anomers ofD-xylopyranose [35] (Fig. 3).The chemical profile of the extracts revealed a highproportion of sesquiterpenes. Several biological activities[36] have been reported for sesquiterpenes 1 – 4 andthese include anti-inflammatory [36a], antiallergic [36b],local anesthetic [36c], nematicidal on Bursaphelenchusxylophilus [36d], cytotoxic, antifungal, and bactericidal[36e], in addition to herbicidal activity on weeds [24][36f].Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 have not been isolatedbefore from O. pulchella. Compound 6 is a polyunsatu-rated long-chain fatty acid and this class of compound hasshown several biological activities, including antimicro-bial, cytotoxic, antioxidant, and signaling [37][38].Compound 9 (3.1 mg) was isolated from subfractionA4.4 (54.5 mg) as a yellow amorphous solid. The HR-EI-TOF-MS data for 9 showed a molecular ion at m/z433.1497 ([M  H]), which is consistent with the molec-ular formula C22H26O9. The1H-NMR spectrum of 9(Table 1) is consistent with the presence of an anomericH-atom that resonates at d(H) 4.24 and aromatic H-atomsbetween d(H) 6.71 and 7.08. The 13C-NMR spectrum isconsistent with the presence of a sugar and aromaticrings. The sugar was identified as glucose by comparisonof the chemical shifts and splitting patterns of the sugarH-atoms [39]. The anomeric C(1)-atom (d(C) 104.4) wascorrelated to H–C(80a) (d(H) 3.91) and H–C(80b) (d(H)3.66) in the HMBC spectrum. The H–C(80a) and H–C(80b) signals were correlated in the COSY spectrum andfurther correlated to the signal for H–C(70) (d(H) 2.81).The signal for H–C(70)was correlated in the HMBC tothree aromatic C-atom signals at d(H) 130.0 (C(10)), d(C)131.3 (C(20), C(60)), and C(80) (d(C) 71.7). These findingssuggest that 9 has a phenylethanoid glycoside as a partialstructure. The resonances at d(H) 4.42 and 4.20 wereassigned to H–C(6a) and H–C(6b), respectively, of thesugar moiety due to the correlation with H–C(5) (d(H)3.42) in the COSY spectrum. The phenylethanoyl substi-tution at C(6) was revealed by the HMBC experiment, inwhich H–C(6a) and H–C(6b) were correlated to the esterC=O C-atom (d(C) 173.8 (C(800))) (Table 1). C(800) wascorrelated to H–C(700) at d(H) 3.53, and H–C(700) was cor-related to the aromatic C-atom resonances at d(C) 126.3(C(100)) and d(C) 130.9 (C(200), C(600)) in the HMBC spec-trum of 9. The positions of the OH groups in the aro-matic rings were determined by comparison of thechemical shifts with those of compounds with the sameFig. 1.

There-fore, the structure of 9 was assigned as shown in Fig. 3.This compound is described here for the first time and ithas been named ocoteol.The bioactivities of five sesquiterpenes (1 – 5), oneflavonoid (7), and two aromatic esters (10, 11) wereassessed in the wheat coleoptile bioassay in a concentra-tion range from 103 to 105M. Compounds 8 and 9 werenot tested due to the low amounts obtained. The resultsare summarized in Fig. 4.Sesquiterpenes 1 – 5 showed significant inhibitoryactivity on coleoptile elongation at the two highest con-centrations (103 and 3 9 104M), with values betweenFig. 2.

These values arehigher than those of the commercial herbicide Logranat these concentrations. The antibacterial activity andinhibitory effect on the growth of the phytopathogensFusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi and Botrytis cinereahave also been also reported for compound 5 [40]. Theflavonoid 7 (afzelin) showed low inhibitory activity, witha value of 50% at 103M, and it showed only smalleffects at higher dilutions. Flavonoids represent animportant class of polyphenols and their presence inplants seems to be related to defense functions, controlof plant hormones, enzymes, and the inhibition ofallelopathic agents. The two aromatic esters 10 and 11(benzyl salicylate and benzyl benzoate) had the bestactivity profiles and the highest inhibitory activity oncoleoptile elongation. These compounds showed greaterthan 90% inhibition at the highest concentrations (103and 3 9 104M) and even at the third concentrationtested (104M), at which it exceeded 80% inhibition.These values are higher than those of the commercialherbicide at the same concentrations. These compoundsisolated from O. pulchella have shown cytotoxic activityon tumor cell lines (CCF-STTG1, Hep3B, HepG2,H-460, AGS, N-87, SW-620, MCF-7, and VERO), ofwhich astrocytoma cells were the most resistant [12]. Iftherapeutic concentrations have been achieved in targettissues, it has been demonstrated that these componentsmay be useful in the treatment of age-related inflamma-tory conditions.The results obtained in this bioassay show that the mostactive compounds were 5 (spathulenol) and the aromaticesters 10 (benzyl salicylate) and 11 (benzyl benzoate).These activity values were corroborated by calculating theIC50 values for all of the compounds. It is noteworthy thatcompounds 10 and 11 showed similar or lower IC50 valuesFig. 3.

(Table 2).Compounds 5, 10 and 11 were selected for evaluationon L. sativa and L. esculentum (Fig. 5). L. esculentumwas the species that was affected the most by theAcOEt extract of leaves. The compounds tested showedinhibitory activity on all three parameters assessed, espe-cially at the first concentration (103M), with valuesbetween 60% and 80% on root and stem growth and40–60% on germination (Fig. 5). These three compoundsalso showed inhibitory activity on L. sativa, albeit withlower values than the initial AcOEt extract. It is worthhighlighting the inhibition of root growth, with valuesclose to 40% obtained with compound 11 at the highestconcentration tested (103M).ConclusionsThe AcOEt leaf extract from O. pulchella was the mostpromising in the study of allelopathic activity, with thespecies L. esculentum affected the most (inhibition valueshigher than 60% on root and stem growth).Eleven compounds have been isolated from thisextract and these were characterized. Compounds 1, 2,4, and 6 have not been isolated previously from O. pul-chella and ocoteol (9) is described for the first time.Sesquiterpene 5, and the aromatic esters 10 and 11were the most active in the coleoptile bioassay, withinhibition values higher than 90%. The IC50 values forcompounds 10 and 11 were similar to those of the her-bicide Logran. These three compounds showed inhibi-tory activity on L. esculentum – especially at thehighest concentration tested, with values around 60%and 80% on root and stem growth, respectively. Theseactivities are very similar to that exhibited by theAcOEt extract. Therefore, it can be concluded thatspathuleol (5), benzyl salicylate (10), and benzyl ben-zoate (11) are responsible for the allelopathic activityshown by O. pulchella.This research was supported by the CAPES (Coor-denacão de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nıvel Supe-rior), Brazil, the Ministerio de Economıa yCompetitividad (MINECO) (Project AGL2013-42238-R),and Consejerıa de Economıa Innovacion y Ciencia, Juntade Andalucıa (Project DP12-TEP-725).Fig. 4.

A voucherspecimen was filed in the herbarium of the BotanyDepartment of the Federal University of S~ao Carlos, withthe number HUFSCar 8799. After collection, the leaves,stems, and roots were dried at 40 °C for 72 h and groundin an industrial mill.Dried material (60 g) was defatted with hexane byapplying an ultrasound-assisted extraction. The followingquantities of hexane extracts were obtained: 1.7 g(leaves), 194 mg (stems), and 581 mg (roots). The mate-rial was subsequently dried (48 h at 40 °C in an oven)and subdivided into small portions of leaf, stem, and rootpowder. AcOEt and MeOH were used to extract defattedmaterial and these extractions yielded the followingamounts after removal of the solvent: leaves 3.39 g(AcOEt) and 3.16 g (MeOH); stems 1.1 g (AcOEt) and2.1 g (MeOH); and roots 1.1 g (AcOEt) and 1.08 g(MeOH). Chlorophyll was removed from leaf extractsusing mixtures of H2O/MeOH and this treatment yieldedfour fractions: 20% MeOH (Fr A), 40 + 60% MeOH(Fr. B), 80% MeOH (Fr. C), and 100% MeOH (Fr. D),ending with CH2Cl2 as eluent on an RP-18 chromato-graphy column. These extracts (AcOEt and MeOH) fromleaves (without chlorophyll), stems, and roots were bio-assayed on etiolated wheat coleoptiles. The AcOEt extractfrom the leaves was the most active, and this was thereforestudied in a phytotoxicity bioassay on target species.Bearing in mind that the AcOEt extract of leaves wasthe most active, the remaining leaves (1.25 kg), previouslydefatted, were extracted with 10 l of AcOEt in portionsof 15 g of plant material using an ultrasonic bathFig. 5.

HR-EI-TOF-MS (neg.): 433.1497 ([M  H]; calc. 433.1499).Coleoptile BioassayThe extracts (AcOEt and MeOH) at concentrations of0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/ml were subjected to an etiolatedwheat coleoptile bioassay. This test is widely used to eval-uate the sensitivity of wheat to a wide range of bioactivesubstances [41].Triticum aestivum L. cvHard seeds were pregerminated in water for 3 days in thedark at 22  1 °C, stored in Petri dishes (15 cm diameter)and covered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper with around100 seeds in a volume of 15 ml of deionized H2O. Theroots and caryopses were removed from seedlings and thecoleoptiles were removed. The latter were placed in aSiles guillotine and the apical 2 mm were cutoff and dis-carded [41]. The next 4 mm of the coleoptiles wereremoved and used for bioassays [42]. All manipulationswere performed under a green safelight [43].Crude extracts were dissolved in DMSO (0.1%) anddiluted in phosphate-citrate buffer containing 2% sucroseat pH 5.6. Three control samples were used: buffer withDMSO, buffer alone, and an internal reference with Log-ran herbicide (59% terbutryn and 0.6% triasulfuron).The commercial herbicide was used as an internal refer-ence to allow comparison with a study reported previ-ously [44].The concentrations were 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/ml forextracts and 103, 3 9 104, 104, 3 9 105, and 105Mfor compounds. Three replicates were performed for eachdilution. Each assay was carried out on five coleoptilesand 2 ml of extract, buffer or Logran. The tubes wererotated at 6 rpm in a roller tube apparatus (Stuart Scien-tific) for 24 h at 25 °C in the dark. After 24 h, the coleop-tiles were removed and measured using Photomedsoftware after digitalization of the images [44]. Data werestatistically analyzed using a Welch’s test [45] and arepresented as percentage difference from the control.Germination and Growth BioassayThe bioassay was conducted in a Petri dish (50 mm dia-meter) on Whatman No. 1 paper as support. Germinationand growth were conducted in aq. solns. with pH con-trolled using 102M 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acidand 1M NaOH (pH 6.0). The extracts were dissolved inDMSO and the resulting solns. were diluted with buffer(5 ll DMSO soln./ml buffer). Parallel controls were alsorun as described above for the coleoptile bioassay. Theconcentrations used were 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/ml forextracts, and 103, 3 9 104, 104, 3 9 105, and 105Mfor compounds. Samples were prepared and added to theChem. Biodiversity 2016, 13, 1058 – 1067 1065© 2016 Wiley-VHCA AG, Z€urich www.cb.wiley.comseeds in a Petri dish, which was then covered with paraf-ilm and incubated in the dark. Each treatment consistedof four replicates of 20 seeds per replicate (total of 80seeds) and 1 ml of soln. in each Petri dish.The selected targets species were based on the resultsof a previous phytotoxicity study [44]. The standard targetspecies (STS) proposed included the dicotyledons tomato(Lycopersicon esculentum WILL.), cress (Lepid-ium sativum L.), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and themonocotyledon onion (Allium cepa L.).The Petri dishes were further incubated at 25 °C in aMemmert ICE 700 controlled environment growth cham-ber. The photoperiod was 24 h of dark for onion, tomato,cress, and lettuce. Bioassays took 4 days for cress, 5 daysfor tomato, 6 days for lettuce, and 7 days for onion. Afterthe specified incubation period, the seeds from each Petridish were stored at 10 °C for 24 h to stop seedlinggrowth before measurement. A commercial herbicide ofknown activity was used as a control, namely Logranmarketed by Syngenta [44].Statistical AnalysisThe data for germination rate, root length, and shoot lengthwere recorded using a Fitomed system [46]. Data were ana-lyzed statistically using the Welch’s test, with significancefixed at 0.01 and 0.05. The results are presented as percent-age differences from the control. Zero represents control,positive values represent stimulation, and negative valuesrepresent inhibition. In order to achieve a more accurateanalysis of the results, it was necessary to calculate a seriesof statistical parameters. As a consequence, IC50 valueswere calculated and the cluster analysis was carried out.The IC50 values were calculated using sigmoidal dose–response or dose–response variable slope models.REFERENCES[1] P.
