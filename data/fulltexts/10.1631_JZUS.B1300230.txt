Abstract:    The aim of this present study is to investigate the effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum oil (essential oil from 
Z. bungeanum Maxim.) on cytotoxicity and the transdermal permeation of 5-fluorouracil and indomethacin. The cy-
totoxicity of Z. bungeanum oil on dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes was studied using an MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The rat skin was employed to determine the 
percutaneous penetration enhancement effect of Z. bungeanum oil on hydrophilic and lipophilic model drugs, i.e., 
5-fluorouracil and indomethacin. The secondary structure changes of the rat stratum corneum (SC) were determined 
using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and saturated solubilities and 
SC/vehicle partition coefficients of two model drugs with and without Z. bungeanum oil were also measured to un-
derstand its related mechanisms of action. It was found that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Z. 
bungeanum oil were significantly lower in HaCaT and CCC-ESF-1 cell lines compared to the well-established and 
standard penetration enhancer Azone. The Z. bungeanum oil at various concentrations effectively facilitated the 
percutaneous penetration of two model drugs across the rat skin. In addition, the mechanisms of permeation en-
hancement by Z. bungeanum oil could be explained with saturated solubility, SC/vehicle partition coefficient, and 
secondary structure changes of SC.

1  Introduction 
 
The pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim., 
belonging to the Rutaceae family, is commonly used 
as a flavoring and traditional Chinese medicine for its 
flavors and medicative characteristics in China. Ac-
cording to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), the pericarp of Z. bungeanum Maxim. pos-
sesses the medical functions of warming the spleen 
and stomach to relieve pain and killing parasites to 
relieve itching, and it is also effective for the therapy 
of pathogenic wind, epigastric pain, eczema, pruritus, 
fungal infection, diarrhea, and dysentery (Gong et al., 
2009; Wei et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011). In addition, 
Z. bungeanum oil is also widely used for topical 
remedies. According to the statement on Li Yue Pian

Wen (published in 1870), an ancient classic literature 
on topical remedies in China, these herbs like Z. 
bungeanum Maxim., peppermint oil, which are rich in 
essential oil, can effectively promote the percutaneous 
absorption of the active components in a prescription 
for their unique properties. 
In our previous studies, Zhitong cataplasm, a 
clinical empirical formula mainly consisting of the 
extracts of four herbs, Pericarpium Zanthoxyli (Z. 
bungeanum Maxim.), Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Radix 
Angelicae Dahuricae, and Herba Asari, was devel-
oped and topically used for the treatment of rheuma-
toid arthritis and joint pain. We found that Z. 
bungeanum oil in this prescription had the function of 
facilitating the percutaneous absorption of the active 
components besides its medicative function as de-
scribed above. However, there is currently no sys-
tematic information available about the skin permea-
tion enhancement effect of Z. bungeanum oil. It is 
well known that it is a prerequisite to enable the drug 
molecule to pass through the skin for the exertion of 
drug pharmacological activity. Furthermore, most of 
the essential oil is mainly composed of terpenes  
(Gong et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2011), which have been 
generally reported to enable the drug molecule to 
penetrate across the skin as a penetration enhancer 
(Aqil et al., 2007; Sapra et al., 2008). The Z. 
bungeanum oil is thus supposed to possess the prop-
erties of facilitating the percutaneous absorption of 
the components in a prescription besides its medica-
tive characteristics. In addition, the Z. bungeanum oil 
appears to offer low toxicity potential for use in 
transdermal formulations due to its natural origin 
(Fox et al., 2011). 
Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the 
toxicity and percutaneous penetration enhancement 
activity of Z. bungeanum oil and its underlying 
mechanisms. Considering the diverse properties of the 
components penetrating through the skin, 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU, n-octanol/water partition coefficient logKo/w= 
−0.95) and indomethacin (IM, logKo/w=3.80) were 
chosen as hydrophilic and lipophilic model drugs, 
respectively (Zhao et al., 2008). In addition, rat skin 
was employed to monitor the skin permeation en-
hancement effect of Z. bungeanum oil on the trans-
dermal delivery of model drugs. 
 
 
2  Materials and methods 
2.1  Drugs and chemicals 
5-FU and IM were obtained from Beijing Ouhe 
Technology Co., Ltd. and Suzhou Yacoo Co.,  
Ltd., China, respectively. 1,8-Cineole, limonene, and  
terpinen-4-ol were supplied by the TCI Tokyo 
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan. Propylene glycol 
(PG) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent 
Co., Ltd., China. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide (MTT), and C8–C20 n-alkanes were obtained 
from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). Azone was 
purchased from Beijing Changhua Fine Chemical Co., 
Ltd., China. Acetonitrile and methanol of high-  
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade 
were supplied by Merck KGaA (Germany). All other 
chemicals used were of analytical grade. 
2.2  Plant materials and essential oil extraction 
The dried fruits of Z. bungeanum used in this 
work were purchased from Anguo Lulutong Co., Ltd. 
(Hebei, China), and identified by Prof. Shou-ying DU 
(Department of Chinese Pharmacy, Beijing Univer-
sity of Chinese Medicine, China). These specimens 
were harvested in August, 2012. A voucher specimen 
was deposited in the Department of Chinese Phar-
macy, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China. 
The dried herbs (2.0 kg) were subjected to hydro- 
distillation in 5 volumes of water for 3 h by using a 
Clevenger-type apparatus. The yellowish essential oil 
was obtained in a yield of 2.9% (w/w) after drying 
with anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored under  
N2 at 4 °C in a sealed brown vial until tested and 
analyzed. 
2.3  Cell line and culture 
HaCaT (epidermal keratinocytes) and CCC- 
ESF-1 (dermal fibroblasts) cell lines were obtained 
from the Cell Resource Center of Institute of Basic 
Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical 
Sciences (Peking Union Medical College, China). 
The cells were incubated in Minimum Essential Me-
dium (MEM Eagles with Earle’s Balanced Salts) and 
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DME H-21 
4.5 g/L glucose), respectively, supplemented with  
 
 
Lan et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol)   2014 15(2):153-164 155
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin/ 
streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.  
HaCaT cells were fusiform under a microscope  
(Fig. 1c), and CCC-ESF-1 cells were fibroblast-like 
cells (Fig. 1d). 
2.4  HPLC methodology of model drugs 
The HPLC system for analyzing drug concen-
trations was equipped with an SPD-20A variable- 
wavelength ultraviolet absorbance detector, two 
LC-20AT pumps, and computer integrating system 
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Alltima AQ ODS column 
(250 mm×4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size; Grace) and 
Purospher STAR RP-18 column (250 mm×4.6 mm 
i.d., 5 μm particle size; Merck) were used to deter-
mine the contents of 5-FU and IM, respectively. For 
5-FU, the mobile phase was distilled water at a flow 
rate of 1 ml/min. 5-FU was detected at 266 nm with 
the retention time of 7.5 min. For IM, the mobile 
phase was a mixture of acetonitrile/0.1 mol/L acetic 
acid (45:55, v/v) at the flow of 1 ml/min. IM was 
detected at 231 nm with the retention time of 12.5 min. 
Calibration curves for 5-FU and IM were linear over 
the ranges of 0.5–500 μg/ml and 0.5–250 μg/ml, re-
spectively. The coefficients of variation for intra- and 
inter-day variations were below 1%. 
2.5  Gas chromatography-mass spectral (GC-MS) 
analysis 
The Z. bungeanum oil was subjected to GC-MS 
analysis on a Shimadzu system (Shimadzu QP-2010, 
Japan) equipped with a National Institute of Stand-
ards and Technology (NIST) database and a DB-1MS 
capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 mm, Agilent). 
Helium (99.99%) was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 
1.0 ml/min. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C 
for 20 min and then programmed from 50 to 200 °C at 
a rate of 2 °C/min. The injector temperature, MS 
transfer line and ion source temperatures were set at 
250, 280, and 250 °C, respectively. Mass scanning 
was in the range of 45–500 amu. The split ratio was 
1:20. An aliquot (1.0 μl) of the diluted sample (1/100 
in n-hexane, w/v) was injected automatically.  
The constituents of the essential oil were identi-
fied by matching their MS fragmentation patterns 
with those in NIST 2008 mass spectral library and also 
by comparing their Kovat retention indices, which 
were determined by injection of the sample with a 
solution containing the homologous series of C8–C20 
n-alkanes as reported before (Sereshti et al., 2011; 
Wu et al., 2012). Moreover, the major oil contributors 
were further confirmed by comparing the corre-
sponding pure standard compounds. The percentage 
composition was computed by the normalization 
method from the GC peak areas.  
2.6  Determination of physicochemical properties 
of essential oil 
For recognition of the basic physiochemical 
properties of Z. bungeanum oil, an ultraviolet-visible 
spectroscopy (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (SP-752, 
Shanghai Spectrum Instruments Co., Ltd., China)  
was employed to monitor its maximum UV absorp-
tion wavelength. An automatic surface tensiometer 
(JK99B, Shanghai Zhongcheng Digital Technology 
Instruments Co., Ltd., China) was adopted to detect 
the surface tension of the essential oil. The conduc-
tivity of the oil was determined using a DDS-307 
conductivity meter (Shanghai Jingke Electronic Co., 
Ltd., China). The pH value measurement was made 
using a pH meter (PHS-3C, Sanxin, China) at 25 °C. 
The relative density was measured through a weigh-
ing method using an electronic balance (Sartorius, 
Germany). 
2.7  Preparation of full thickness skin and stratum 
corneum (SC) 
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing (200± 
10) g were purchased from Shibeifu Laboratory 
Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). After 
sacrificing the rats with excess ether inhalation, hair 
from the abdominal surface was removed with an 
animal hair clipper (Codos, China) with an extreme 
precaution as to not impair the skin. The shaved skin 
was then excised from the animals, the subcutaneous 
tissue was removed surgically and the dermal side 
was wiped with a cotton swab to remove the adhered 
fat tissue. The full thickness skin prepared was sub-
sequently washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 
wrapped in aluminum foil, and stored at −20 °C (used 
within two weeks). All the animal experiments were 
conducted in compliance with the Guiding Principles 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Beijing 
University of Chinese Medicine, China, and the ex-
perimental protocol was approved by the Committee 
on Animal Research of the Beijing University of

Chinese Medicine. 
The excised rat skin was treated with 2 mol/L 
sodium bromide solution for 8 h as reported previ-
ously (Jain et al., 2002). The SC samples were sepa-
rated by using a cotton swab moistened with double 
distilled water. SC sheets were thoroughly washed 
with water and dried in a vacuum desiccator. 
2.8  Cytotoxicity assay 
To determine the cellular toxicity of Z. bungeanum 
oil in epidermal keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast 
cultures, the MTT assay was used to monitor the toxic 
effects of Z. bungeanum oil on skin cells in vitro as 
described in detail elsewhere (Song et al., 2005). 
Fibroblasts or keratinocytes were seeded into 96-well 
plates at a density of 7000 cells in 100 µl medium per 
well. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with varying 
concentrations of enhancer solution in a culture me-
dium with 1% DMSO (as a vehicle) for 24 h at 37 °C. 
The cells that were treated with culture medium 
containing 1% DMSO were used as the control. 
Subsequently, the medium was removed and sup-
plemented with fresh medium containing 20 µl MTT 
solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate buffer) and the cells 
were incubated for 4 h. Then the medium was re-
placed with 150 µl DMSO to dissolve the formazan 
crystals. The plate was incubated for 10 min while 
shaking. Absorbance was read at 490 nm using a 
microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, 
Finland). The half maximal inhibitory concentrations 
(IC50) were calculated using SPSS software v16.0 
according to the previously described method (Xiang 
et al., 2010). 
2.9  Skin permeation studies  
The vertical Franz-type diffusion cell (Shanghai 
Kaikai Technology Trade Co., Ltd., China) with a 
diffusional area of 1.77 cm2 and a receptor chamber 
volume of 7 ml was employed to investigate percu-
taneous penetration enhancement activity of the Z. 
bungeanum oil. The epidermis prepared was sand-
wiched between the diffusion cells with the SC side 
up and the dermal side exposed to the receiver com-
partment containing isotonic PBS (pH 7.2), the re-
ceptor cells were thermostated at 32 °C, and the so-
lution in the receptor chambers was stirred continu-
ously at 300 r/min. The skin was then treated with  
 
2 ml of varying concentrations of Z. bungeanum oil in 
PG:water (80:20, v/v). Saturated suspensions of model 
drugs were used to insure maximum thermodynamic 
activity and maintain sink conditions. The control was 
treated with a vehicle only. Samples (1 ml) were 
withdrawn from the receptor chamber at predeter-
mined time (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 22, and 24 h), and 
replaced with an equivalent volume of buffer solution, 
and the samples were immediately assayed using the 
HPLC method described in Section 2.4. 
2.10  Determination of saturated solubility of 
model drugs 
In order to investigate the effect of Z. bungeanum 
oil applied on the saturation solubility of the model 
drugs, an excess drug was added to the known vol-
umes of the vehicle with or without varying concen-
trations of Z. bungeanum oil, vortexed for 3 min fol-
lowed by sonication for 15 min to dissolve the drug, 
and then equilibrated at (32±0.5) °C for more than  
48 h. The saturated solution was then centrifuged at 
10 000 r/min for 15 min and aliquots of supernatant 
were filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon filter and di-
luted by a mobile phase before HPLC analysis.   
2.11  Measurement of SC/vehicle partition coeffi-
cient of model drugs 
The partition coefficient of model drugs into  
SC with or without various concentrations of Z. 
bungeanum oil treatment was measured as reported 
previously (Song et al., 2005). The SC samples were 
pulverized in a mortar with a pestle. One milliliter  
of varying concentrations of Z. bungeanum oil in 
PG:water (80:20, v/v) containing 0.1 g/ml model drug 
was added to 10 mg ground SC with frequent vor-
texing. The control was treated with a vehicle only. 
The mixture was equilibrated for 10 h at 37 °C. The 
supernatant solution was obtained by centrifuging at 
10 000 r/min for 10 min and then analyzed for the 
drug content. The amount of drug bound to the SC 
was calculated by subtracting the amount of the drug 
in the supernatant from the initial drug concentration. 
All partition studies were conducted in triplicate.  
The partition coefficient (K) of the model drug  
was obtained using the following equation: K= 
(drug concentration in SC)/(drug concentration in 
vehicle).

2.12  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR) studies  
 
The dried SC sheet was cut into approximately  
1 cm2 pieces and incubated for 12 h in 5 ml of the 
respective solutions at room temperature, where the 
solutions were 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% Z. bungeanum 
oil, 0.2 mol/L Azone, and solvent (PG:water=80:20 
(v/v), used as the control), respectively. The SC was 
then cleaned carefully with distilled water to remove 
the residual solvent on the SC surface and placed in a 
vacuum desiccator at 37 °C overnight for complete 
dehydration. The spectral measurements of all pieces 
were made with a Nexus FTIR spectrometer (Thermo 
Nicolet, USA) equipped with an attenuated total re-
flectance (ATR) attachment with the following pa-
rameters: resolution of 2 cm−1, scanning times of 100, 
and scanning range of 650–4000 cm−1. The FTIR 
spectral curves in each group were recorded using an 
OMNIC 6.2 program attached to the IR instrument 
itself. 
2.13  Data and statistical analysis 
The parameters for the skin permeation studies 
were calculated by plotting the cumulative amount of 
drug permeated across the skin against time (h). 
Steady state flux (Js) was calculated as the slope of the 
linear portion of the plot (between 8 and 14 h). The 
lag time (Tlag) was determined by extrapolating the 
linear portion of the curve to the X-axis. The cumu-
lative drug amount in the receptor chamber after 24 h 
(Q24) and diffusion parameter (D/h2) were calculated 
from the following equations:

where Ci is the drug concentration of the receiver 
solution at each sampling time, Ct is the drug con-
centration of the sample, Vs and Vr are the volumes of 
the sampling solution and the receiver solution, re-
spectively, D is the diffusion coefficient within the 
skin, and h is the diffusional path length. 
In order to compare the permeation enhancement 
capacity of different concentrations of Z. bungeanum 
oil, the enhancement ratio (ER) for flux was calculated  
 
using the following equation: ER=(flux for skin 
treated with essential oil)/(flux for control (exposed to 
only vehicle)). 
Data were expressed as the mean±standard de-
viation (SD) and the number of replicates (n) was 
given in the pertinent figures. A two-tailed Student’s 
t-test was used when comparing two different condi-
tions. In all cases, P<0.05 was considered significant. 
 
 
3  Results and discussion 
3.1  Chemical compositions and physicochemical 
properties of the Z. bungeanum oil 
A total of 48 compounds were identified from 
the essential oil, which represented 96.35% of the 
total oil. There were 31 constituents accounting for 
above 0.5% of the total oil as listed in Table 1, and 
three major oil contributors (i.e., terpinen-4-ol, 1,8- 
cineole, and limonene, which represented 41.38% of 
the total oil) were further confirmed using the corre-
sponding pure compounds. Based on the results of the 
GC-MS analysis, the Z. bungeanum oil contained 
high contents of oxygenated monoterpenes and 
monoterpene hydrocarbons, and the major com-
pounds were terpinen-4-ol (18.42%), 1,8-cineole 
(15.49%), limonene (7.47%), α-terpineol (5.79%), 
and γ-terpinene (5.62%), which was slightly different 
from the previous report (Wang et al., 2006) on ac-
count of different producing areas, growth conditions, 
and extracted methods. The results of the measure-
ment of the essential oil physicochemical properties 
exhibited that the oil had the physiochemical parame-
ters as follows: density 0.86 mg/ml; pH 5.18; electric 
conductivity 0 μs/cm; surface tension 24.96 mN/m; 
maximum UV absorption wavelength 227 nm. 
Generally, the major components determine the 
biological properties of the essential oil, and it has 
been reported that some terpenes identified from the 
essential oil could enhance the transdermal permea-
tion of the polar and non-polar drugs, such as  
terpinen-4-ol (Magnusson et al., 1997), 1,8-cineole, 
terpineol (Narishetty and Panchagnula, 2005), and 
limonene (Okabe et al., 1989), indicating these major 
oil contributors play a crucial role in the enhancement 
activity of Z. bungeanum oil as a transdermal pene-
tration enhancer.

3.2  Cytotoxicity of Z. bungeanum oil on skin cells 
Most penetration enhancers have been shown to 
produce skin irritation or toxicity in spite of their 
fairly satisfactory performance in enhancing the 
permeation of drug molecules; hence few of them 
have been approved for clinical use. The cytotoxici-
ties of Z. bungeanum oil and the well-established and 
standard penetration enhancer Azone were studied 
using MTT assay, and the results of keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts treated with different concentrations of 
selected penetration enhancers are presented in Fig. 1. 
All examined permeation enhancers induced dose- 
dependent reductions in cellular viability after 24 h 
(Figs. 1a and 1b). As summarized in Table 2, the IC50 
values (i.e., the concentration of drugs inducing a 
50% decrease in cell viability) of Z. bungeanum oil 
were prominently higher in both HaCaT cells and 
CCC-ESF-1 cells compared to those of Azone, indi-
cating that Z. bungeanum oil was probably a low toxic 
penetration enhancer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3  Effects of Z. bungeanum oil on percutaneous 
permeation of model drugs 
To determine the permeation enhancement ac-
tivity of Z. bungeanum oil across the rat skin, the 
control was prepared only by dissolving the model 
drugs in the base solvent, i.e., PG:water (80:20, v/v). 
PG:water was chosen as a base solvent on account of 
its ability to solubilize most tested components, in-
cluding Z. bungeanum oil and Azone. Moreover, as 
the well-established and standard penetration en-
hancer, Azone had been employed by many re-
searchers to achieve significant permeation en-
hancement and the concentration (0.2 mol/L) was 
typically used in skin penetration enhancement 
studies (Meidan et al., 2003; Kaushik et al., 2010; 
Batheja et al., 2011); hence 0.2 mol/L Azone was 
used to compare and better evaluate the permeation 
enhancement activity of the oil. 
The effect of Z. bungeanum oil at various con-
centrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) on the permea-
tion parameters (flux, Tlag, and Q24) for 5-FU is pre-
sented in Table 3. The oil at higher concentration was 
not considered in this study on account of its incom-
plete dissolution in the vehicle. The oil at different

value compared with the control, which was con-
sistent with the previous studies (Singh et al., 1993; 
He et al., 2008). However, the 5% oil group (ER=

activity than Azone, suggesting that Z. bungeanum oil 
at a proper concentration could effectively promote 
the transdermal delivery of the hydrophilic drugs with 
a long Tlag.

The permeation profile of the cumulative 
amounts of IM penetrated across the rat skin is shown 
in Fig. 3. Similar to 5-FU, Z. bungeanum oil also 
markedly enhanced the percutaneous absorption of 
IM, whereas the Tlag value gradually decreased with 
increasing the oil concentration as presented in Table 4, 
implying that Z. bungeanum oil remarkably enhanced 
the penetration of the lipophilic drugs with a relative 
short Tlag. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the results of the penetration studies 
using two model drugs, it appears that Z. bungeanum 
oil could effectively facilitate the percutaneous ab-
sorptions of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs in  
a concentration-dependent manner, and also had a 
higher efficiency for the penetration of the hydro-
philic drugs across the rat skin than for that of the 
lipophilic drugs according to the ER values. In addi-
tion, it is worth noting that the rat skin is more per-
meable than human skin due to the differences in their 
compositions and structure (Niazy, 1996), and more 
accurate evaluation should be measured using porcine 
skin or human skin (Reifenrath et al., 1984).  
3.4  Possible action mechanisms of Z. bungeanum oil 
The mechanisms of action of transdermal pene-
tration enhancers have been investigated by many 
research groups and possible explanations for the 
enhancement activity have been suggested as follows: 
(1) alteration of the thermodynamic activity of the 
drug causing that drug molecules readily penetrate 
across the skin (Song et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006); 
(2) increased partition of the drug into the SC (Vaddi 
et al., 2002); (3) interactions with SC lipids or pro-
teins resulting in disruption of the chemical structure 
or composition of the SC and disorganization of the 
highly ordered structures, thus increasing the delivery 
of the drug molecules (Williams and Barry, 2012). 
Certainly, other potential mechanisms for explaining 
the activity may also exist.  
The results of the saturated solubilities and 
SC/vehicle partition coefficients of both 5-FU and IM 
after treatment with varying concentrations of Z. 
bungeanum oil are summarized in Tables 3, 4, and 5, 
respectively. For 5-FU, the saturated solubility 
slightly decreased with increasing the oil concentra-
tion, implying that the thermodynamic activity of 
5-FU was altered to a certain extent in the presence of

the essential oil (Zhang et al., 2006). The saturated 
solubility of the 5-FU in the low-concentration oil 
(1% and 3%) was higher than that of the control, 
which was probably due to its moderate hydrophilic-
ity. However, there was no significant difference 
between the control and the Z. bungeanum oil at dif-
ferent concentrations in terms of the SC/vehicle par-
tition coefficient, which indicates that Z. bungeanum 
oil might contribute negligibly to the partitioning of 
hydrophilic drugs into SC due to its lipophilicity 
properties. Contrary to 5-FU, the SC/vehicle partition 
coefficient of IM gradually increased with the oil 
concentration increasing, and it was up to 5.85 times 
higher than that of the control when the oil concen-
tration reached 10%. Furthermore, Z. bungeanum oil 
at different concentrations gradually improved the 
saturation solubility of IM, suggesting that the ther-
modynamic activity of IM was also significantly 
altered. Therefore, it implied that the Z. bungeanum 
oil could change the saturated solubility or the 
SC/vehicle partition coefficient of drugs to improve 
their delivery through the skin. 
However, compared with the penetration ER, the 
alteration in the SC/vehicle partition coefficient or 
thermodynamic activity of two model drugs was rel-
atively weak, suggesting that the Z. bungeanum oil 
probably enhanced the drug transdermal delivery 
substantially by changing the skin barrier property, 
but not altering the drug properties. Considering that 
Tlag is related to diffusivity, and it can reflect changes 
in both the length of the permeation path (h) and the 
diffusion coefficient (D) to suggest the interaction of 
the enhancer with the SC lipid and protein according 
to Eq. (2) as described above. As shown in Tables 3 
and 4, for both of 5-FU and IM, the Tlag values were 
roughly reduced with increasing the oil concentra-
tions, indicating that the Z. bungeanum oil probably 
interacted with the SC lipids or protein to disrupt its 
barrier properties. 
The FTIR absorption spectra were thus meas-
ured to investigate the biophysical changes of the rat 
skin SC properties due to its advantages on obtaining 
information about the lipids and keratin conformation 
in the SC. A representative spectrum of normal un-
treated rat skin SC shows that the major absorption 
peaks around 2850 and 2918 cm−1 due to symmetric 
and asymmetric C–H stretching vibration of the lipid 
alkyl chains (Zhang et al., 2007), the fatty acid car-
bonyl stretching peaks near 1733 cm−1 (Moore and 
Rerek, 2000; Jain et al., 2002), and two strong amide 
absorption peaks in the range of 1500–1700 cm−1, i.e., 
1652 cm−1 due to C=O stretching vibration of the 
amide I band and 1538 cm−1 due to the N–H bending 
vibration of the amide II band (Khurana et al., 2013). 
The shift to a higher frequency occurs when the CH2 
groups along the alkyl chain of lipids change from 
trans to gauche conformation, suggesting that the SC 
lipid is disturbed, and the peak areas of the two C–H 
absorption bands are proportional to the amount of the 
SC lipids (Zhang et al., 2007). The change in the 
amide I and amide II absorption peaks to a lower 
wavelength is observed to indicate the alterations of 
the keratin conformation under the effect of penetra-
tion enhancers (Zbytovská et al., 2004; He et al., 
2009). In addition, the frequencies of the fatty acid 
carbonyl stretching mode, the keratin amide I and 
amide II modes are sensitive to hydrogen bonding, 
which can provide information on head-group inter-
actions in the SC lipids (Moore and Rerek, 2000).  
The FTIR absorption spectra of rat SC treated 
with varying concentrations of the Z. bungeanum oil 
are displayed in Fig. 4. Compared with untreated rat 
SC, FTIR of rat SC treated with the solvent showed 
no obvious shift in wavenumber or changes in peak 
area or peak height, suggesting that PG:water (80:20, 
v/v) system was inefficient to perturb or extract the 
SC lipids and proteins. The decrease in peak area of 
the C–H stretching bands and the shift in wavenumber 
were observed after treatment with different concen-
trations of Z. bungeanum oil, and the higher the oil 
concentration was, the greater the shift in C–H 
stretching vibration was (as presented in Fig. 5 and 
Table 6). This indicated that the Z. bungeanum oil

perturbed and extracted the SC lipids to alter the skin 
permeability. It was notable that the presence of  
0.2 mol/L Azone only resulted in the shift of C–H 
stretching vibration to high wavenumber, whereas the 
peak areas of the two C–H stretching vibration ab-
sorption bands exhibited negligible change in com-
parison to those of untreated rat SC, which implied 
that 0.2 mol/L Azone increased the drug permeation 
mainly by perturbing the SC lipids. Meanwhile, the 
absence of –C=O peak of fatty acid indicated that the 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
changes in the hydrogen bonding of the polar regions 
of the lipid bilayers might occur after treated with 
either Z. bungeanum oil or Azone. The wavelength 
movements of the amide I and amide II bands were 
narrow, perhaps indicating the Z. bungeanum oil 
contributed negligibly to the alteration of the keratin 
conformation.

4  Conclusions 
 
Based on the results of this study, it was found 
that Z. bungeanum oil appeared to be a low skin tox-
icity in comparison to the well-established and standard 
penetration enhancer Azone, and effectively facilitated 
the percutaneous permeation of both 5-FU and IM 
through rat skin in a concentration-dependent manner. 
The partition studies exhibited that the partition co-
efficient for 5-FU was not altered, whereas it signifi-
cantly increased for IM with incorporation of Z. 
bungeanum oil, indicating possible interaction of the 
oil with the SC lipids. Contrary to 5-FU, the saturated 
solubility of IM was gradually decreased with the 
increasing of the oil concentration, implying that the 
Z. bungeanum oil had altered the thermodynamic 
activities of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs to 
some extent. The results of FTIR studies showed that 
Z. bungeanum oil facilitated the drug permeation 
mainly by perturbing and extracting the SC lipids. In 
conclusion, Z. bungeanum oil could effectively facil-
itate the permeation of both hydrophilic and lipophilic 
drugs with low cytotoxicity.
