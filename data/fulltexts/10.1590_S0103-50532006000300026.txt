Larghi and Teodoro S. Kaufman*Instituto de Química Orgánica de Síntesis (IQUIOS, CONICET-UNR) and Facultad de Ciencias Bioquímicas yFarmacéuticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Suipacha 531 (S2002LRK) Rosario, República ArgentinaEste trabalho descreve a síntese da N-metil-N-formiltiramina, um novo derivadoβ-fenetilamídico isolado de Cyathobasis fructiculosa (Bunge) Aellen. O produto natural foipreparado em seis etapas com bom rendimento, partindo-se do 4-hidroxibenzaldeído.The synthesis of N-methyl-N-formyltyramine, a novel β-phenethylamide derivative isolatedfrom Cyathobasis fructiculosa (Bunge) Aellen, is reported. The natural product was preparedin six steps and good overall yield from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde.Keywords: synthesis, β-phenethylamide derivative, Cyathobasis fructiculosa, natural productIntroductionβ-Phenethylamides, exemplified by compounds 1 and2,1 constitute a relatively widespread family of naturalproducts, the members of which have been found mainlyas soluble constituents of cell-wall fractions of higherplants.2 Several amides, structurally related to them, havebeen found in different plant species,3 and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (3) has demonstrated to have anubiquitous occurrence.4,5There is no definite conclusion yet about the functionsof the β-phenethylamides; however, it has been discussedtheir possible role in plant growth processes, as well astheir participation in self defense, due to their antimicrobialand antiviral effects.6 In addition, β-phenethylamides suchas 4-7 have been informed to display interesting biologicalactivities, ranging from DNA strand scission7 to anti-mutagenic and anticarcinogenic,8 and including inhibitionof the lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide productionin macrophages,9 as well as inhibition of acetyl-cholinesterase.10 Noteworthy, N-acetyl tyramine (8) is aninducible phytoalexin found in soybean seeds,11 while Paikand coworkers reported the isolation of the unusualcompounds 9-11 from Xenorhabdus nematophilus, abacterial strain which grows symbiotic with a nematode.These β-phenethylamides were shown to be cytotoxicagainst five human cancer cell lines.12Very recently, Topçu and coworkers13 isolated N-methyl-N-formyltyramine (12) from the aerial parts androots of Cyathobasis fruticulosa (Bunge) Aellen(Chenopodiaceae), the only species of the genusCyathobasis of the Turkish flora, which grows mostcommonly in Central Anatolia. In view of the potentialinterest of this type of compounds, we decided toprepare 12, and herein we disclose a short synthesis ofthe natural product from commercial 4-hydroxybenzal-dehyde (13).600 Larghi and Kaufman J. Braz. Chem. Soc.Results and DiscussionWilliamson etherification of 13 with benzyl chlorideprovided 99% of aldehyde 14 (Scheme), which wassubjected to a Henry condensation with nitromethane inthe presence of ethylenediammonium diacetate as base,14furnishing 90% of nitrostyrene 15. In turn, this wassubmitted to reduction with lithium aluminum hydride,giving β-phenethylamine 16, as an oil which easilydarkened upon contact with air; therefore, this wasimmediately amidated in refluxing ethyl formate,providing formamide 17 in 44% overall yield. Noteworthy,the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 17 exhibited signals oftwo conformers, even at 70 ºC in DMSO-d6.Next, 17 was N-methylated with methyl iodide, andthe resulting amide 18 obtained in 79% yield wassubjected to a final 10% Pd/C mediated catalytichydrogenation, furnishing 92% of synthetic 12, thespectral data of which fully agreed with those previouslyreported for the natural product.13 Clear signals of the twoconformers of 12 and 18 were also observed in their 1Hand 13C NMR spectra. Interestingly, despite that the useof benzyl ether intermediates required additionalprotection and deprotection steps, increasing the lengthof the sequence, it allowed convenient manipulation ofamine and amide reaction intermediates.In conclusion, a simple synthesis of 12 was achievedin six steps from commercial 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde.Protection of the starting phenol as a benzyl ether allowedconvenient manipulation of the reaction intermediateswithout sacrificing efficiency of the synthetic sequence.ExperimentalGeneral proceduresMelting points (uncorrected) were taken on an ErnstLeitz Wetzlar model 350 hot-stage microscope. FT-IRspectra were determined with a Shimadzu IR Prestige 21spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra wereacquired in CDCl3 employing TMS as internal standard,with a Bruker AC200-E spectrometer operating at 200.13and 50.33 MHz, respectively; coupling constants (J) areexpressed in Hertz. HRMS data were obtained from KentElectronics (UK). The reactions were carried out underdry argon atmospheres, employing oven-dried glassware.All new compounds gave single spots on TLC plates runin different hexane-EtOAc solvent systems. Spots werevisualized by exposure to UV light (254 and 365 nm),followed by spraying with ethanolic p-anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid reagent and careful heating. Flash columnchromatographies were carried out with silica gel 60 H,eluting with hexane-EtOAc mixtures under positivepressure and employing gradient techniques.E-1-Benzyloxy-4-(2’-nitrovinyl)-benzene (15)Benzyl chloride (0.52 mL, 4.54 mmol) was added to astirred suspension of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (13, 482 mg,3.95 mmol) and K2CO3 (818 mg, 5.92 mmol) in absoluteEtOH (4 mL). The slurry was refluxed until completeconsumption of the starting material (by TLC), and thesolvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure. Afteraddition of H2O (5 mL), the aqueous phase was extractedwith EtOAc (3 x 25 mL) and the combined organic extractswere successively washed with 10% Na2CO3 (2 x 10 mL)and brine (10 mL).
