NoundouFOR Aa b s t r a c tEthnopharmacological relevance: The leaves, stems and roots of Alchornea cordifolia (Schumach. andThonn.) Müll. Arg. are used as traditional medicine in many African countries for the management ofgastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary tract infections as well as for the treatment of wounds.Aim of the study: To determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of leaves and stemsof A. cordifolia on gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and to identify thecompounds in the extracts that may be responsible for this activity.Materials and methods: The antibacterial activities of crude extracts [hexane, chloroform (CHCl3), ethylacetate (EtOAc), ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH) and water (H2O)] as well as pure compounds isolatedfrom these extracts were evaluated by means of the micro-dilution assay against four Gram-positivebacteria, i.e. Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 and S. saprophyticus ATCC 15305, as well as four Gram-negative bacterial strains, i.e. Escherichiacoli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 23246 and Proteus mir-abilis ATCC 43071. The isolation of the active constituents was undertaken by bio-autographic assays inconjunction with chromatographic techniques. The identification and characterisation of the isolatedcompounds were done using mass spectrometry (MS) and Fourier transformed infrared spectrometry(FTIR) as well as 1D- and 2D- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses.Results: The leaves and stems of A. cordifolia exhibited varied antibacterial activity against all eight pa-thogens. Most of the MIC values ranged between 63 and 2000 mg/ml. The highest activities for the crudeextracts (63 mg/ml) were observed against S. saprophyticus [stem (EtOAc, CHCl3 and hexane), leaves(MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc and CHCl3)], E. coli [stem (MeOH and EtOH), leaves (MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc andCHCl3)], M. catarrhalis [leaves (EtOAc and CHCl3)], K. pneumoniae [stem (CHCl3), leaves (CHCl3)] and S.aureus [leaves (CHCl3)]. Seven constituents [stigmasterol (1), stigmasta-4,22-dien-3-one (2), friedelin (3),friedelane-3-one-28-al (4), 3-O-acetyl-aleuritolic acid (5), 3-O-acetyl-erythrodiol (6) and methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (methyl gallate) (7)] were isolated from the stem MeOH extract. All these com-pounds displayed some antibacterial activity against the eight pathogens with highest activity against S.saprophyticus (2 mg/ml). Furthermore, this is the first report of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 isolated fromA. cordifolia and where a complete set of 2D-NMR data for fridelane-3-one-28-al (4) is presented.Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the antibacterial activities of A. cordifolia extracts may be dueto the presence of the seven isolated compounds, where compounds 3–6 showed the best activity. Theobserved activity against gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary tract pathogens supports thetraditional use for the treatment of such ailments.& 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
