ABSTRACT
Quiescent cottonseeds (Gosypium kirsswm L.) were fractionated non-
aqueously to protein bodies and nonparticulate cytoplasm for analyses of
sugar contents. Nonparticulate cytoplasm was more than 3-fold richer In
total free sugars than were protein bodies, but based on the content of
cytoplasm In each fraction, sugars were dstributed almost equally In them.
Thi-layer chromatography and hgh-pressure iquid chromatography re-
vealed five sugars: sucrose, raffinse, tetrasacchardes I nd II, and stach-
yose. Raffinose and stachyose were located manly, and tetrasaccharide I
totally, in nonparticulate cytoplasm compared to protein bodies; sucrose
and tetrasaccharide II were distributed about equally in each fractio
Lipid and protein, which comprise the compositional bulk of
the intracellular cytoplasm of dicotyledonous oilseeds, are located
principally in spherosomes (oleosomes) and protein bodies (aleu-
rone grains), respectively (6, 10). Starch, seldom present in dico-
tyledonous oilseeds, including cottonseed, is sequestered in starch
grains. The intracellular sites ofother noncellulosic carbohydrates,
particularly free sugars, however, are unknown.
In this communication, we describe both the amounts and the
intracellular distributions of free sugars in cottonseed. Cottonseed
contains by weight about 10% of these sugars, the composition of
which has been examined previously (2, 7, 9).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue. Cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum L.), var Acala 4-22-77
'Glandless,' was dehulled with a Bauer mill and stored at 4°C
over Drierite.
Subcellular Fractionation. A modification of the method of
Yatsu and Jacks (10) was used in which refined cottonseed oil
replaced glycerol as the isolation medium, and the centrifugation
steps were 1,IOOg for 2.5 min and 3,000g for 15 min. For analyses,
isolation medium and native lipids were removed from each
fraction by repeated suspension in hexane followed by centrifu-
gation, and the samples were dried in vacuo.
Extraction of Free Sugars. Fifty-mg samples were extracted
three times with 50 ml of 76% (v/v) aqueous ethanol and the
extracts were combined. Further extractions rendered no addi-
tional sugars. Ethanol was evaporated in vacuo and either aqueous
or 76% ethanolic solutions of the original ethanol-soluble material
were analyzed for free sugars.
Sugar Analyses. Total sugars in aqueous extracts were assayed
by the anthrone reaction (5), and reducing substances by the
TPTZ2 reaction (1).

2Abbreviation: TPTZ, ferrous-2,4,6-tripyridyl-S-triazine.
TLC was performed according to Conkerton et al. (3). Precoated
Sil G-25 plates (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.) were used with
chloroform:methanol (60:40, v/v). Detection occurred by spraying
with naphthoresorcinol-sulfuric acid (8) and, for reducing sub-
stances, spraying with TPTZ reagents and substituting oven heat-
ing for the boiling water bath. Ninhydrin spray was used for
amines (8).
HPLC was performed with Waters Associates chromatograph
model ALC/GPC 244 with a ,uBondapak-carbohydrate column
and a R401 differential refractometer (detector). The solvent was
83% acetonitrile:17% water with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and
methyl a-D-glucoside was an internal standard.
Except for tetrasaccharides I and II, sugars were identified from
comparisons to authentic samples subjected to TLC and HPLC.
Identifications of the tetrasaccharides were deduced from other
chromatographic properties (7).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Three lipid-free preparations were obtained: the original cell-
free homogenate (first supernatant) and two fractions: nonparti-
culate cytoplasm (subsequent supernatants) and protein bodies
(pellets of the subsequent supernatants), which correspond to
'Supernatant' and 'Aleurone grain' fractions, respectively, ofYatsu
and Jacks (10). Analyses of alcohol dehydrogenase and acid
proteinase activities indicated no cross-contamination of the frac-
tions (10). Spherosomal membranes were included in the nonpar-
ticulate fraction but inasmuch as they contain mere traces of sugar
and comprise a relatively small amount of cytoplasm (T. J. Jacks,
unpublished results), their contribution of sugar was insignificant
to this study.
Table I shows the amounts of total free sugars in the isolates.
The nonparticulate cytoplasm was richer in sugars than were the
protein bodies, but protein bodies comprised the more abundant
component of the cytoplasm. Thus, from the amounts of dry
weight and total sugars in each fraction we calculated that each
fraction contained about half the total sugars of the original

homogenate, e.g. 5.8 and 5.5 g of total free sugars (anthrone
reaction) were in the nonparticulate cytoplasm and protein body
fractions, respectively, for a recovery of 99.1%. A similar distri-
bution was calculated from the HPLC data.
Reducing sugars appeared present from positive TPTZ reactions
of the 76% ethanol extracts of homogenate and each fraction.
However, naphthoresorcinol-sulfuric acid spots corresponding to
known reducing sugars were not detected by TLC analyses of the
extracts. Furthermore, positive TPTZ reaction occurred only at
the origin, which was also positive to ninhydrin but negative to
naphthoresorcinol-sulfuric acid. Finally, passage of the extract
from the cell-free homogenate through Dowex 50W-X8(H+) resin
removed the TPTZ reactivity. These results indicated that reduc-
ing substances (TPTZ-reactive) other than sugars were present
(probably native 76% ethanol-soluble amino acids, reactive with
the TPTZ reagents).
TLC analysis revealed the presence of five sugars in the ho-
mogenate and nonparticulate cytoplasm: sucrose, raffinose, two
structurally characterized but trivially unnamed sugars referred to
as tetrasaccharides I and II (for structures,< see Ref. 7), and
stachyose (in order of ascent). Four sugars (absence of tetrasac-
charide I) were in the protein bodies. Verbascose, reported in
cottonseed (7), glucose, and fructose were absent, even when the
plates were 'overloaded.'
The same five sugars were found by HPLC. Table II shows
their contents and individual intracellular distributions. Poor re-
coveries for tetrasaccharide I and stachyose were probably due to
the fact that very small amounts were present to start with. It is
apparent from Table II that, although the nonparticulate cyto-
plasm was richer in each sugar (g/100 g of sample), the relative
abundance of protein bodies (Table I) yielded an almost 50/50
distribution ofeach sugar in the two fractions, except for stachyose
and tetrasaccharide I. This indicates that neither subcellular com-
ponent was a specific site for sucrose and tetrasaccharide II, but
only that nonparticulate cytoplasm was enriched in these sugars
compared to those in protein bodies. On the other hand, the
principal site for raffinose, stachyose, and tetrasaccharide I ap-
peared to be the nonparticulate cytoplasm.
Besides finding the intracellular distributions of free sugars in
cottonseed, which probably reflect those of other oiiseeds, our
work greatly extends the early observation (4) that the nonparti-
culate cytoplasm of oiLseeds (exemplified by peanut) was rich in
sucrose.
