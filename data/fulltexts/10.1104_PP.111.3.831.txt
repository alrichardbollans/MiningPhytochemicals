An in  vitro system that converts phenylalanine to  phenylacetal- 
doxime in the biosynthesis of the glucosinolate glucotropaeolin has 
been established in seedlings of Tropaeolum majus L. exposed to  the 
combined treatment of jasmonic acid, ethanol, and light. l h e  treat- 
ment resulted in a 9-fold induction, compared with untreated, 
dark-grown seedlings, of de novo biosynthesis measured as incor- 
poration of radioactively labeled phenylalanine into glucotropaeo- 
lin. Formation of the inhibitory degradation product benzylisothio- 
cyanate during tissue homogenization was prevented by 
inactivation of the thioglucosidase myrosinase by addition of 1 O0 
mM ascorbic acid to  the isolation buffer. This allowed the isolation 
of a biosynthetically active microsomal preparation from the in- 
duced T. majus plant material. l h e  enzyme, which catalyzes the 
conversion of phenylalanine to  the corresponding oxime, was sen- 
sitive to cytochrome P450 inhibitors, indicating the involvement of 
a cytochrome P450 in the biosynthetic pathway. It has previously 
been shown that the oxime-producing enzyme in the biosynthesis of 
phydroxybenzylglucosinolate in Sinapis alba 1. is dependent on 
cytochrome P450, whereas the oxime-producing enzymes in  Bras- 
sica species have been suggested to  be flavin monooxygenases or 
peroxidase-type enzymes. l h e  result with T. majus provides addi- 
tional experimental documentation for a similarity between the 
enzymes converting amino acids into the corresponding oximes in  
the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides. 
Glucosinolates are amino acid-derived, secondary plant 
products containing a sulfate and a thioglucose moiety 
(Ettlinger and Kjaer, 1968). Glucosinolates are found 
throughout the order Capparales, which includes the fam- 
ily Brassicaceae containing the agriculturally important 
crop plants oilseed rape and Brassica forages. When tissue 
is damaged or food is processed, glucosinolates are rapidly 
hydrolyzed by the thioglucosidase myrosinase (EC 3.2.3.1). 
The presence of glucosinolates in these plants is of eco- 
nomic importance because of the potentially harmful ef- 
fects of their breakdown products (Duncan, 1992). Glucosi- 
nolates and their degradation products may defend plants 
against insect and funga1 attack (Fenwick et al., 1983; 
Chew, 1988) or serve as attractants to insects that are 
specialist feeders on cruciferae (Feeny et al., 1970).

Glucosinolates are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and 
indolyl glucosinolates, depending on whether they are de- 
rived from Met, Phe, and Tyr, or Trp. Approximately 100 
different glucosinolates have been identified. The parent 
amino acid often undergoes a series of chain elongations 
prior to entering the biosynthetic pathway, and the glu- 
cosinolate product is often subjected to secondary modifi- 
cations such as hydroxylations, methylations, oxidations, 
etc. (Ettlinger and KjEr, 1968). In vivo biosynthetic studies 
using seedlings or excised tissues have demonstrated that 
N-hydroxy amino acids, nitro compounds, oximes, thiohy- 
droximates, and desulfoglucosinolates are precursors of 
glucosinolates (Poulton and Mdler, 1993; Wallsgrove and 
Bennett, 1995). Tropaeolum majus L. has been used exten- 
sively in in vivo studies of glucosinolates. This plant pro- 
duces only a single glucosinolate (glucotropaeolin) derived 
from Phe, which, in contrast to the chain-elongated amino 
acids, is commercially available as a radioactively labeled 
precursor. Early in vivo trapping experiments demon- 
strated that labeled phenylacetaldoxime accumulates in 
shoots of T. majus upon administration of labeled Phe and 
unlabeled oxime, indicating the involvement of oximes as 
intermediates in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates (Under- 
hill, 1967). 
Knowledge about the enzymes catalyzing the biosyn- 
thesis of glucosinolates is only slowly emerging. The last 
two steps in the pathway are catalyzed by two soluble 
enzymes, the UDPG-thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase 
(EC 2.4.1.-), which glucosylates the thiohydroximate, and 
the 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’-phosphosulfate:desulfoglu- 
cosinolate sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.-), which converts the 
desulfoglucosinolate into the glucosinolate. These two en- 
zymes have been purified and shown to be nonspecific 
with respect to the nature of the side chain (Glendening 
and Poulton, 1988; Jain et al., 1990; Reed et al., 1993; Guo 
and Poulton, 1994). The sulfur-donating enzyme has not 
been characterized, but feeding experiments suggest that 
Cys is the sulfur donor (Matsuo, 1968). The nature of the 
enzymes catalyzing the conversion of amino acids to 
oximes has been the subject of many discussions. In Bras- 
sicaceae, the involvement of flavin monooxygenases (Ben-

nett et al., 1993; Dawson et al., 1993), peroxidase types of 
enzymes (Ludwig-Muller et al., 1990), and Cyt P450 en- 
zymes has been suggested. Recently, we demonstrated that 
the conversion of Tyr to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime in 
the biosynthesis of p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate in Sina- 
pis alba L. involves a Cyt P450-dependent monooxygenase 
as evidenced by photoreversible carbon monoxide inhibi- 
tion (Du et al., 1995). Taxonomically, S .  alba belongs to the 
Brassicaceae family, and T. majus belongs to the Tropaeo- 
laceae family. Therefore, characterization of the oxime- 
producing enzyme system in T. majus would be of interest 
in providing evidence in support of one of the suggested 
enzyme types in the Brassicaceae family for taxonomic 
reasons. Earlier attempts to isolate a biosynthetically active 
in vitro enzyme system from T. majus were hampered by 
low biosynthetic activity and by the inhibitory effect of 
benzylisothiocyanate generated by degradation of glu- 
cotropaeolin by myrosinases during tissue homogenization 
(Lykkesfeldt and Maller, 1993). 
In the present paper, we report the isolation of a biosyn- 
thetically active microsomal enzyme system catalyzing the 
conversion of Phe into phenylacetaldoxime in seedlings of 
T. majus. The enzyme activity was induced 9-fold by expo- 
sure of the seedlings to the combined treatment of jasmonic 
acid, ethanol, and light, compared with untreated, dark- 
grown seedlings. Furthermore, we show that the enzyme 
system responsible for oxime production in T. majus resem- 
bles the system involved in biosynthesis of p-hydroxyben- 
zylglucosinolate in S .  alba in that they are both dependent 
on Cyt P450. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals 
Phenylacetaldoxime was chemically synthesized from 
phenylacetaldehyde using hydroxylamine hydrochloride 
in an alkaline medium as described previously (Sekiya et 
al., 1961). ~-[U-l~C]phe (464 mCi/mmol) was purchased 
from Amersham. [U-14C]Phenylacetaldoxime was enzy- 
matically synthesized by administration of ~-[u- '~C]Phe to
microsomal preparations from Tropaeolum majus. The reac- 
tion mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate, and phe- 
nylacetaldoxime was isolated from the extracts by TLC as 
described below. Benzylglucosinolate was a generous gift 
from Professor Anders Kjzr (Department of Organic 
Chemistry, The Technical University, Lyngby, Denmark). 
2-Amino-indan-2-phosphonic acid was a generous gift 
from Professor Nikolaus Amrhein. BAS 110, BAS 111, LAB 
150 978, and Tetcyclasis were gifts from BASF (Limburger- 
hof, Germany). SK&F 525-A was a gift from Smith, Kline 
and French (King of Prussia, PA). Ancymidol was a gift 
from Lilly Research Laboratories (Greenfield, IN). Pheno- 
barbital was purchased from Nomeco (Copenhagen, Den- 
mark). A11 other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 
Plant Material 
Seeds of T. majus L. cv Empress of India were obtained 
from Dansk Havefraforsyning (Kolding, Denmark). The 
seeds were germinated in complete darkness for 1 week in 
moist vermiculite at 24"C, after which the etiolated seed- 
lings reached a height of approximately 4 cm. At this stage, 
the seedlings were transferred to continuous light (60 pmol 
photons m-'s-', 400-700 nm of light provided by fluores- 
cent lights). After 3 d in the light, the seedlings were 
treated with various chemical reagents for 24 h and then 
subjected to in vivo labeling experiments. 
In Vivo Biosynthesis of Clucotropaeolin 
Excised seedlings of T. majus were inserted into a test 
tube containing 1 pCi of ~- [u- '~C]Phe  or trace amounts 
of [U-14C]phenylacetaldoxime in 20 p L  of water and 
incubated for 24 h in continuous light. After incubation, 
the plant material was extracted with 90% (v /v)  metha- 
no1 (Lykkesfeldt and Maller, 1993). The extracts were 
concentrated in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in 
water. Qualitative analysis of the glucosinolate content 
was carried out using TLC (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck, 
Darmstadt, Germany) in solvent system 1. Radioactive 
bands on TLC plates were visualized using autoradiog- 
raphy. Quantitative determinations of glucotropaeolin 
were carried out on an HPLC system equipped with UV 
(model LKB-2141, LKB, Bromma, Sweden) and radioac- 
tivity (model LB-506 C1, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) 
monitors. Aliquots (50 pL)  of extracts were applied to 
the column (Nucleosil 1OO-10Cl, 250 X 4.6 mm; Mach- 
erey-Nagel, Diisen, Germany) and eluted isocratically 
with 10% (v /v)  solvent B (70% [v/v] methanol) in sol- 
vent A (0.1 M ammonium acetate) at a flow rate of 1.0 
mL/min (Du et al., 1995). The UV absorption of the 
effluent was recorded at 254 nm, and the radioactivity 
was simultaneously monitored by the Berthold monitor 
fed liquid scintillator (Monoflow 2; National Diagnos- 
tics, Manville, NJ) at a rate of 3.0 mL/min. The retention 
time of glucotropaeolin was verified with an authentic 
sample. The biosynthetic activity was calculated from 
the radioactivity incorporated into glucotropaeolin with 
correction for the loss of one carbon atom by decarbox- 
ylation. A11 assays were carried out in duplicate. 
Preparation of Microsomal Enzyme System 
The microsomes were prepared as described earlier by 
Du et al. (1995). Typically, 100 g of chemically treated 
seedlings of T. majus were ground in a prechilled mortar 
with 10 g of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and 30 g of acid- 
washed sea sand in 200 mL of isolation buffer (250 mM 
Tricine, 250 mM SUC, 100 mM ascorbic acid, 50 mM of 
NaHSO,, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 
mg/mL BSA, pH 8.2), which was degassed and argon 
flushed three times prior to use. After the sample was 
filtered and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,00Og, the micro- 
soma1 pellet was obtained by centrifugation of the 15,0008 
supernatant for 30 min at 200,OOOg. The microsomal pellet 
was resuspended in isolation buffer and dialyzed sequen- 
tially under a nitrogen atmosphere against the isolation 
buffer for 1 h; against 50 mM Tricine, pH 7.9, 100 mM 
ascorbic acid, 2 mM DTT for 1 h; and twice against 50 mM 
Tricine, pH 7.9, 2 mM DTT for 1 h each. After dialysis, the

Biosynthesis of Glucosinolate in Tropaeolum majus 833 
microsomal preparation was adjusted to a final protein 
concentration of 10 mg/mL. The isolation procedure was 
carried out at 4°C. 
In Vitro Biosynthesis of Phenylacetaldoxime 
The in vitro biosynthetic activity of the microsomal prep- 
aration from T. majus was determined as production of 
phenylacetaldoxime using Phe as substrate. A standard 
reaction mixture contained 0.4 mg of microsomal protein, 1 
pCi (2.2 nmol) of ~-[u- '~C]Phe (464 mCi/mmol) diluted 
with varying amounts (0-200 nmol) of unlabeled Phe, and 
0.6 pmol of NADPH in a total volume of 280 pL of 50 mM 
Tricine, pH 7.9, 2 mM DTT. The reaction was started by the 
addition of NADPH. After incubation at 35°C for 30 min, 
the reaction was stopped by extraction with 750 pL of ethyl 
acetate. After the sample was centrifuged at 15,OOOg for 5 
min, the ethyl acetate phase was carefully removed with- 
out interference with the protein-rich interphase. The reac- 
tion mixture was re-extracted once. The combined extracts 
were concentrated in vacuo, streaked onto TLC plates, and 
eluted with system 1. Radioactive bands on the TLC plates 
were visualized using autoradiography. The area corre- 
sponding to p-coumaric acid was scraped off and eluted 
with ethyl acetate. The eluate was concentrated and rerun 
on a TLC plate eluted with solvent system 2. This allowed 
the separation of phenylacetaldoxime from p-coumaric acid 
in extracts from green plant material as verified with au- 
thentic standards. The 14C-labeled ox ime  was eluted by 
ethyl acetate and quantified by scintillation counting (LKB- 
RackBeta, Bromma, Sweden). The production of oxime was 
calculated from the radioactivity incorporated into oxime 
with correction for the loss of the C-1 atom by decarbox- 
ylation. 
Effects of Cyt P450 lnhibitors on 
Phenylacetaldoxime Production 
Microsomal reaction mixtures containing 1.0 pCi of L-[U- 
14C]Phe were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mM of Cyt 
P450 inhibitors as described previously (Halkier and 
Mdler, 1991). After 30 min of incubation at 35"C, the 
reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate and 
analyzed by TLC eluted with solvent system 1. The area 
corresponding to p-coumaric acid was extracted with ethyl 
acetate, rerun on a TLC plate, and eluted with solvent 
system 2. The relative intensity of the oxime band on 
autoradiography was quantified using a visual imager. 
CC-MS Analysis 
Phenylacetaldoxime for GC-MS was obtained by incu- 
bating standard microsomal reaction mixtures with 0.7 mM 
Phe, followed by purification on TLC as described above. 
The isolated phenylacetaldoxime was dissolved in ethyl 
acetate and analyzed on a mass spectrometer (JMS 
AX505W, JEOL) directly interfaced to a gas chromatograph 
(HP5890 Series 11, Hewlett-Packard). Splitless injection at 
180°C was applied. The capillary column (HP-1, Hewlett- 
Packard) was 25 m, 0.2 mm i.d., 0.33-pm film thickness. 
The head pressure was 70 kPa, and the oven temperature 
was programed as follows: 40°C for 1 min, 10"C/min to 
250°C, and 250°C for 5 min. Electron impact mass spectra 
(70 eV, 200-250°C) were obtained at a repetition rate of 1 
scanl s. 
RESULTS 
lnduction of de Novo Biosynthesis of Clucotropaeolin 
Seedlings of T. majus were treated with chemical re- 
agents known to induce either phytoalexin biosynthesis or 
Cyt P450 enzymes to define whether these reagents would 
also induce de novo biosynthesis of glucosinolates. The 
induction was measured as incorporation of radioactivity 
into glucotropaeolin upon administration of 14C-labeled 
Phe to the seedlings. Exposure of the seedlings to light for 
3 d increased incorporation of radioactivity into 14C-la- 
beled glucotropaeolin approximately 2-fold compared with 
dark-grown plants (Fig. 1). Exposure to light combined 
with treatment with 50% ethanol resulted in an approxi- 
mately 4-fold induction. A 9-fold induction, compared with 
untreated, dark-grown seedlings of de novo biosynthesis of 
glucotropaeolin, was obtained by the combined treatment 
of seedlings with light and 50 FM jasmonic acid dissolved 
in 50% ethanol. 
As much as 40% of the radioactivity of the fed [14C]Phe 
was incorporated into glucotropaeolin, when the seedlings 
were exposed to light and jasmonic acid dissolved in eth- 
anol. The other chemical reagents showed a lower level of 
induction, varying from 2- to 4-fold (Fig. 1). The combined 
effect of light, jasmonic acid, and ethanol on the de novo 
biosynthesis of glucotropaeolin was transient, with an in- 
crease in the first 2 d after treatment followed by a decrease 
to normal level within the next 2 d (Fig. 2). The total 
content of glucotropaeolin in T. majus seedlings was not 
affected by the treatment (data not shown).

In Vitro Biosynthesis of Phenylacetaldoxime
A biosynthetically active microsomal preparation was
isolated from T. majus using jasmonic acid-induced, light-
grown seedlings. Production of 14C-labeled phenylacetal-
doxime from 14C-labeled Phe by T. majus microsomal reac-
tion mixtures was demonstrated by co-migration of a
labeled component with authentic phenylacetaldoxime on
TLC (Fig. 3). The production of oxime by the microsomal
system was strictly NADPH dependent. Phe is also a pre-
cursor for the ubiquitous phenylpropanoid pathway. This
results in a concomitant accumulation of cinnamic acid and
p-coumaric acid in the microsomal reaction mixtures, as
seen on the TLC chromatogram (Fig. 3). Solvent systems 1
and 2 allow the separation of standards of phenylacetaldo-
xime and p-coumaric acid on the TLC plate. This is not the
case when phenylacetaldoxime and p-coumaric acid accu-
mulated in microsomal reaction mixtures are extracted
with ethyl acetate and applied to the TLC plates (Fig. 3A).
Under these conditions, phenylacetaldoxime and p-cou-
maric acid do not separate in either system, presumably
because of co-extraction of sticky, hydrophobic material
from microsomal membranes. However, when the area
corresponding to p-coumaric acid on the TLC plate eluted
in solvent system 1 is extracted with ethyl acetate and
applied to a second TLC plate, phenylacetaldoxime and
p-coumaric acid separate in either solvent system (Fig. 3B).
The production of oxime has been confirmed by GC-MS
(Fig. 4). On GC, the isolated phenylacetaldoxime gave two
peaks at retention times 13.14 min (£ isomer) and 13.49 min
(Z isomer), as did the authentic phenylacetaldoxime (data
not shown). The MS profile of the two peaks were identical,
with a molecular ion of m/z 135, a [M-H2O]+ ion of m/z 117,
and a tropylium ion of m/z 91 (Fig. 4).
In vivo administration of enzymatically produced 14C-
labeled phenylacetaldoxime to seedlings of T. majus re-
sulted in the production of 14C-labeled glucotropaeolin as
evidenced by co-migration of authentic glucotropaeolin on
TLC (Fig. 5). This supports the identification of oximes as
intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway of glucosino-
lates.
The Effect of Cyt P450 Inhibitors on
Phenylacetaldoxime Production
The production of phenylacetaldoxime by T. majus mi-
crosomes was carried out in the presence of several known
inhibitors of Cyt P450 enzymes (0.1 HIM; Table I). All of the
inhibitors reduced the amount of oxime produced by the
microsomes to varying degrees. This indicates that a Cyt
P450 is involved in the oxime production. Tetcyclasis had
the strongest effect by inhibiting 86%.
DISCUSSION
Ixn this paper we report the isolation of an in vitro enzyme
system that actively converts Phe into phenylacetaldoxime in
the biosynthesis of glucotropaeolin in seedlings of T. majus.
Low biosynthetic activity was overcome by the combined
treatment of seedlings with light and 50 /XM jasmonic acid
dissolved in 50% ethanol. We found that de novo biosynthesis

of the aromatic glucotropaeolin in T. majus was transiently
induced 9-fold upon this treatment. Jasmonates are known to
elicit the accumulation of numerous phytoalexins (e.g. terpe-
noids, flavonoids, anthraquinones) (Blechert et al., 1995). It
has been reported that the total content of indolylglucosino-
lates, but not aromatic and aliphatic glucosinolates, can be
induced by jasmonic acid in several Brassica spp. (Bodnaryk,
1994; Doughty et al., 1995). In our experiments, the total
content of glucotropaeolin was not affected, which is in con-
trast to an up to 9-fold increase in the total content of specific
indolylglucosinolates in several Brassica spp. upon jasmonic
acid treatment (Bodnaryk, 1994). This suggests that the pool
of free Phe in T. majus might be limiting, or that competing
pathways, e.g. the phenylpropanoid pathway, are induced
simultaneously. The induction pattern for glucotropaeolin
biosynthesis upon jasmonic acid treatment in T. majus resem-
bles the pattern for induction of p-hydroxybenzylglucosino-
late synthesis in S. alba (Du et al., 1995). Both plants show

transient inductions in de novo biosynthesis of glucosinolates,
without a concomitant increase in the total content of glucosi-
nolates.
During homogenization of plant material from T. ma-
jus, glucotropaeolin is hydrolyzed by myrosinase to ben-
zylisothiocyanate. Glucosinolate isothiocyanates are
known to react with the hydroxyl groups of the Ser and
Thr residues in proteins (Bjorkman, 1973). Typically,
microsomes from Sorghum bicolor L. Moench are highly
active in catalyzing the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic
glucoside dhurrin (Conn, 1980). However, when sor-
ghum microsomes are prepared in the presence of leaves
from T. majus, the biosynthetic enzymes are inactivated,
and the inhibitory component has been shown to be
benzylisothiocyanate (Lykkesfeldt and M011er, 1993). In
the present study, the formation of benzylisothiocyanate
was prevented by using buffers containing 100 mM ascor-
bic acid, which is known to inhibit myrosinase activity
(Bjorkman and Lonnerdal, 1973). The buffer has previously
been used to isolate successfully biosynthetically active
microsomes from the glucosinolate-producing S. alba (Du
et al., 1995). Under these conditions, the presence of equal
amounts of T. majus plant material during homogenization
resulted in the recovery of more than 50% of the biosyn-
thetic activity in sorghum microsomes (data not shown),
indicating that the formation of benzylisothiocyanate was
significantly reduced.
The detection of phenylacetaldoxime accumulating in
the reaction mixtures was hampered because of interfer-
ence from simultaneously produced intermediates from
the relatively more active phenylpropanoid pathway.
Furthermore, the enzymes in the phenylpropanoid path-
way were also induced by jasmonic acid, as evidenced by
an increased accumulation of cinnamic acid and p-cou-

T. majus microsomes were incubated with 1.0 jiCi of 14C-labeled
Phe in the presence of 0.1 mM Cyt P450 inhibitors in a standard
reaction mixture. After incubation, the microsomal reaction mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by TLC eluted with
solvent system 1. The area corresponding to p-coumarate was ex-
tracted with ethyl acetate and rechromatographed on a TLC plate
eluted with solvent system 2. The relative intensity of the oxime band
on autoradiography was quantified using a visual imager.

ing to phenylacetaldoxime and p-coumaric acid, fol- 
lowed by a rerun on a second TLC plate, allowed the 
proper separation of the two compounds. This opens the 
possibility that earlier attempts to obtain in vitro biosyn- 
thetic activity from T. majus microsomes might have been 
unsuccessful because of the lack of a proper detection 
method for phenylacetaldoxime. Attempts to inhibit spe- 
cifically Phe ammonia-lyase, the first enzyme in the phe- 
nylpropanoid pathway, with 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic 
acid, a known Phe ammonia-lyase inhibitor (Zon and Am- 
rhein, 1992), were unsuccessful. This was presumably be- 
cause of a similar inhibition of the enzyme converting Phe 
into phenylacetaldoxime. 
The enzyme activity catalyzing the conversion of Phe 
to phenylacetaldoxime in T. majus microsomes was 
shown to be inhibited by several Cyt P450 inhibitors. 
This indicates that the enzyme activity is dependent on 
Cyt P450. Tetcyclasis, which showed the highest leve1 of 
inhibition of oxime production, has also been shown to 
be a strong inhibitor of the Cyt P450 enzyme involved in 
the biosynthesis of p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate in S. 
alba (Du et al., 1995). Demonstration of Cyt P450 involve- 
ment by photoreversible carbon monoxide inhibition of 
enzyme activity was not possible because of an approx- 
imately 40% inactivation of enzymic activity upon irra- 
diation of the reaction mixtures. The inactivation was 
probably due to chlorophyll radicals generated in the 
green microsomes by the light. Cyt P450 involvement in 
the biosynthesis of glucotropaeolin in T. majus and of 
p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate in S. alba suggests that 
homologous enzyme systems are catalyzing the conver- 
sion of amino acids to oximes in at least two different 
families within the Capparales order, namely in the Bras- 
sicaceae and Tropaeolaceae. 
Wallsgrove and coworkers have demonstrated NADPH- 
dependent CO, release and oxime production from homo- 
phenylalanine by microsomes isolated from young leaves of 
oilseed rape (Brassica napus)  (Dawson et al., 1993). The ability 
to measure NADPH-dependent release of CO, was extended 
to several aliphatic and .aromatic amino acid precursors of 
glucosinolates in oilseed rape and other Brassica spp. (Bennett 
et al., 1993,1995a). The decarboxylation reactions were shown 
not to be sensitive to the presence of carbon monoxide or the 
Cyt P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole, indicating that Cyt 
P450 was not involved in these reactions (Bennett et al., 
1995a). Wallsgrove and coworkers suggested that the conver- 
sion of aromatic and aliphatic amino acids to oximes in Bras- 
sica spp. was catalyzed by flavin monooxygenases (Bennett et 
al., 1993). Ludwig-Muller et al. (1990) and Bennett et al. 
(1995b) found indications that the oximes in the biosynthesis 
of indolylglucosinolates in Brassica spp. are synthesized by a 
plasma membrane-bound peroxidase type of enzyme. If a11 of 
these sets of observations are correct, this would imply that 
the enzyme system catalyzing the conversion of amino acids 
to oximes within the Brassicaceae family has evolved inde- 
pendently three times. 
Cyanogenic glucosides are a related group of secondary 
plant products that also have amino acids as precursors 
and oximes as intermediates (Conn, 1980). In the biosyn- 
thesis of dhurrin, the Tyr-derived cyanogenic glucoside in 
S. bicolor L. Moench, a single, multifunctional Cyt P450 has 
been shown to catalyze the conversion of Tyr to p-hydroxy- 
phenylacetaldoxime (Sibbesen et al., 1995). Our results on 
Cyt P450 involvement in the oxime production by micro- 
somes from T. majus and S. alba provide experimental 
documentation that homologous enzyme systems catalyze 
the conversion of amino acids into the corresponding 
oximes in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides and 
glucosinolates.
