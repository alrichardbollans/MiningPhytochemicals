Maytenus ilicifolia Mart. ex Reissek é tradicionalmente usada no Brasil para o tratamento de 
úlcera gástrica. O presente trabalho relata a investigação fitoquímica de um extrato etanólico de folhas 
de M. ilicifolia (EEMIL) visando o isolamento de constituintes que foram usados como marcadores 
químicos para monitorar o fracionamento de um extrato aquoso liofilizado de folhas de M. ilicifolia 
(LAEMIL). De EEMIL, quatro flavonóides foram isolados, compreendendo o triglicosídeo flavônico 
mauritianina (1), trifolina (2), hyperina (4), e epi-catequina (5). O fracionamento de LAEMIL levou 
a 5 frações, fornecendo um derivado tetraglicosilado de canferol (3), além do galactitol (6). LAEMIL 
e suas frações foram avaliadas quanto aos efeitos sobre o volume e pH da secreção gástrica em ratos. 
Análise por CLAE (Cromatografia Líquida de Alta Eficiência) revelou que somente frações contendo 
o tri- e tetra-glicosídeos flavônicos 1 e 3 causaram aumento significativo de volume gástrico e pH, 
indicando que esses glicosídeos têm importante papel sob o efeito gastroprotetor de folhas de M. 
ilicifolia.
Maytenus ilicifolia Mart. ex Reissek is traditionally used in Brazil for treatment of gastric 
ulcers. Here we report the phytochemical investigation of an ethanol extract of M. ilicifolia leaves 
(EEMIL) aiming at the isolation of constituents which were used as chemical markers to monitor 
an activity-guided fractionation of a lyophilized aqueous extract of M. ilicifolia leaves (LAEMIL). 
From EEMIL, four flavonoids were isolated, namely the tri-flavonoid glycosides mauritianin (1), 
trifolin, (2) hyperin (4), and epi-catechin (5). Fractionation of LAEMIL led to 5 fractions which 
afforded the tetra-glycoside kaempferol derivative (3), and galactitol (6). LAEMIL and its fractions 
were evaluated in rats for their effects on gastric secretion volume and pH. HPLC (High Performance 
Liquid Chromatography) analysis revealed that only fractions containing the tri- and tetra-flavonoid 
glycosides 1 and 3 caused significant increase of gastric volume and pH, thus indicating that these 
glycosides play an important role on the gastroprotective effect of M.ilicifolia leaves.

Introduction 
Maytenus ilicifolia Mart. ex. Reissek belongs to 
the Celastraceae, a pantropical family. The species is 
popularly known as “espinheira-santa”, being found in 
Southern Brazil, and its leaves are traditionally used to 
treat dispepsy and gastric ulcers.1 The antiulcerogenic 
activity of M. ilicifolia leaves is well documented. Its 
aqueous extract causes significant reduction in the number 
of gastric ulcers induced by both indomethacin and cold-
Leite et al. 249Vol. 21, No. 2, 2010
restraint stress in rats. This protection was similar to 
that observed with cimetidine, a well known histamine 
H2 receptor antagonist.2-4 Investigation of the possible 
mechanism of action of LAEMIL showed that, as in the 
case of cimetidine, it antagonises histamine H2 receptors, 
although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.5 M. 
ilicifolia leaves showed neither toxic nor teratologic effects 
when a lyophilized aqueous extract was administered for 
long periods of time (up to 3 months) and at high doses to 
rats and mice.6 The chemical constituents obtained from 
these plant extracts with solvents of different polarities 
are: terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins and polysaccharides.7-11 
We have previously reported the phytochemical study 
of an infusion of M. ilicifolia leaves when three known 
flavonoid glycosides and a novel flavonoid tetra-glycoside 
were isolated.8 We have also reported the anti-inflammatory 
and antiulcerogenic activities of n-hexane and ethyl acetate 
extracts from M. ilicifolia leaves and have postulated a 
correlation between these pharmacological effects and 
flavonoids.12 Recently, Baggio and collaborators reported 
the potent in vivo gastroprotective properties of a flavonoid-
rich fraction separated from the leaves of M. ilicifolia, 
containing galactitol (25%), epicatechin (3.1%) and 
catechin (2%) as major constituents, which was correlated 
with the in vitro inhibition of rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase 
activity.13 Aiming to further the investigation on the 
bioactive constituents from M. ilicifolia leaves we have 
carried out a phytochemical investigation of an ethanol 
extract of M. ilicifolia leaves (EEMIL) for the isolation of 
compounds which were further used as chemical markers 
to monitor an activity-guided fractionation of a lyophilized 
aqueous extract of M. ilicifolia leaves (LAEMIL). Finally, 
HPLC analyses of LAEMIL and its chromatographic 
fractions were carried out, aiming at establishing a 
correlation between gastroprotective effect and chemical 
composition.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
1H and 13C NMR spectra were registered in a Bruker 
DRX-600 and in a Bruker Advance DRX-400 apparatus. 
Mass spectra were registered in a FINNIGAN MAT90 
spectrometer operating with ionization energy of 159 eV, 
at positive and negative modes. IR and UV-Vis spectra were 
registered in the spectrophotometers Shimadzu IR-408, in 
KBr discs, and Shimadzu UV-160A, respectively. Melting 
points were determined in a MQAPF-301 apparatus 
(Microquímica, Brazil). Column chromatography (CC) was 
undertaken over Macherey Naneg SC6 poliamide, silica 
gel Merck 60 (0.063–0.200 mm) and Sephadex LH-20 
(Pharmacia). A DCC Cromatograph Buchi 670 apparatus 
was employed for countercurrent chromatography. Silica 
gel chromatofoils 60 F254 (Merck) were used for TLC 
analyses.
Plant material
Leaves of M. ilicifolia were collected from native 
populations, at the municipality of Lapa, State of Paraná, 
Brazil, by the agricultural engineer Paulo Guilherme 
Ribeiro, Instituto Agronômico do Paraná – IAPAR, on June 
1999. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium 
of the Universidade Federal de Londrina, Londrina, State 
of Paraná, Brazil (code number FUEL 21881). After drying 
at room temperature for 5 days, the leaves were ground in 
a knife mill. 
Isolation of compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 from EEMIL
EEMIL (191.0 g) was obtained by percolation of the 
dried powder from M. ilicifolia leaves (959 g) after previous 
sequential extraction with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. A 
portion of EEMIL (24 g) was submitted to chromatography 
over Sephadex LH-20 columns (12 × 2 g, each column) 
eluted with methanol; fractions were combined into 6 
groups according to their TLC analysis. Group 2 (fractions 
7-11; 4.4 g) was chromatographed on a poliamide 
column eluted with water followed by water:methanol 
solutions with increasing contents of methanol (20-70%) 
and finishing with methanol. The collected fractions 
(298, 25 mL each) were combined according to their 
TLC analysis. Fractions 14-191 (1.3 g; eluted with 
water:methanol, 4:1) were dissolved in methanol (25 mL), 
filtered and injected onto a DCC apparatus. The lower 
layer of a mixture of chloroform:methanol:water, (8:10:5), 
thoroughly equilibrated in a separation funnel by repeated 
vigorous shaking, was used as stationary phase. The upper 
layer of this mixture was used as mobile phase and it was 
pumped into the column at a flow-rate of 0.5 mL/min 
affording 234 fractions (25 mL each). The DCC fractions 
were appropriately combined and after recrystallization 
(methanol:acetone, 1:1) afforded compound 1 (380 mg). 
Group 4 (fractions 15-21; 4.7 g) from the initial Sephadex 
LH-20 column, after successive injections of aliquots 
(4 × 1.0 g) onto the DCC apparatus employing the same 
system as described here, and combination of these 
fractions according to TLC profiles, afforded 7 groups. 
Re-chromatograhy on Sephadex LH-20 columns and/or 
recrystallizations of fractions 2, 3 and 4 afforded 
compounds 2 (20 mg, recrystallization from methanol), 
Constituents from Maytenus Ilicifolia Leaves and Bioguided Fractionation J. Braz. Chem. Soc.250
4 (12 mg, recrystallization in methanol) and 5 (540 mg, 
recrystallization from water).
Preparation of LAEMIL
LAEMIL was prepared according to the traditional use, 
as described by Carlini.2 Boiling water was added to dried 
leaves powder (400 g) of M. ilicifolia, in the proportion 
of 3 g leaves:100 mL water and the flask was kept 
covered for 15 min. The aqueous extract was separated by 
filtration in a Buchner funnel and was lyophilized, yielding 
78 g (19.5%).
Bioactivity-guided fractionation of LAEMIL and isolation 
of compounds 1, 3 and 6
LAEMIL (40 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of water 
and was chromatographed on a poliamide column 
(600 × 35 mm i.d.). For elution, a gradient of water and 
methanol was used, affording 5 fractions which were 
concentrated in a rotary evaporator (F1 water 100%, 35.0 g; 
F2 water:methanol, 7:3, 2.21 g; F3 water:methanol, 1:1, 
1.55 g; F4 water:methanol, 3:7, 0.91 g; F5 methanol 100%, 
1.06 g). During the concentration in a rotary evaporator, F1 
afforded 6, as a white crystalline compound (30 g). F2 and 
F3, after successive fractionations on Sephadex LH-20 and 
silica gel columns, followed by recrystallizations, led to 1 
(110 mg, recrystallization in methanol:acetone, 1:1) and 
3 (500 mg, recrystallization from methanol:acetone, 1:1). 
LAEMIL and the fractions obtained from the poliamide 
column were evaluated in rats for the gastric secretion 
volume and pH. F1 - F5 were characterized by TLC and 
HPLC fingerprints, employing the isolated compounds 1-5 
as chemical markers.
HPLC analysis of LAEMIL and fractions F1 - F 5
Analyses were carried out on a Merck-Hitachi apparatus 
(Germany) composed of pump L6200-A, automatic injector 
AS-2000A, UV-Vis detector L-4250 and integrator D-2500. 
An ODS column (150 x 4.0 mm, i.d. 5 mm) was employed 
(Merck Darmstadt, Germany), at a temperature of 40 °C 
and flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. UV-Vis detection was set 
at 254 nm. A linear gradient of water (A) and methanol 
(B) was employed (0−35 min, 0–90% B) followed by 
10 min of isocratic elution. Solvents used were of HPLC 
grade (Merck Darmstadt, Germany) and were degassed by 
sonication before use. Samples were dissolved in methanol 
to concentrations of 3.0 mg/mL (LAEMIL) and 1 mg/mL 
(F1–F5 and compounds 1–5), under sonication, for 15 min. 
After centrifugation at 10,000 r.p.m., the sample solutions 
(20 mL) were automatically injected onto the HPLC 
apparatus.
Animals
Male Wistar rats (3-4 months age) weighing 300-350 g 
were provided by Animal House of the Departamento 
de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de São Paulo 
(UNIFESP) and were kept in polypropylene cages (32 × 
40 × 18 cm, 4 animals per cage) in rooms with 12 h light/
dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 a.m.), at controlled temperature 
(23  ± 2 °C). Food and water were available ad libitum. The 
Committee of Ethics in Research of UNIFESP approved 
the experimental protocol (CEP 297/00).
Determination of gastric secretion volume and pH
To groups of 7 or 8 rats, which were fasted overnight 
before experiments, were administered (i.p.) water (control 
group), LAEMIL (140 mg/kg) and fractions (F1 - F5) 
from poliamide column (14 mg/kg each). After 1 h, the 
animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber; their stomachs 
were ligated 2 cm below the pylorus and a small incision 
was made near the pylorus to collect the gastric juice. The 
volume was measured and pH determinations were done 
by using pH indicator paper strips (Spezialind. Kator, 
pH 2.5-4.5 and 4.0-7.0, Merck, Darmstadt). 
Statistical analyses
One-way ANOVA method, followed by multiple 
comparisons was used to analyze the results. The statistical 
significance considered was p < 0.05 (confidence limit: 
95%).

Results and Discussion
EEMIL was initially submitted to chromatography on 
a Sephadex LH-20 column and the fractions obtained were 
rechromatographed on poliamide columns and on a DCC 
apparatus to yield compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 (Figure 1). We 
have previously isolated one of these compounds from an 
infusion of M. ilicifolia leaves, the known tri-glycoside 
kaempferol-3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-O-[a-
L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)]-O-b-D-galactopyranoside 
(mauritianin) (1), along with another tri-glycoside, 
quercetin-3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-O-[a-L-
rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)]-O-b-D-galactopyranoside

(1a) and the di-glycoside kaempferol- 3-O-a-L-
rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)-O-b-D-galactopyranoside (1b).8 
It seems that the presence of the mono-glycoside trifolin 
(kaempferol-3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside) (2) in M. 
ilicifolia leaves is being reported here by the first time while 
hyperin (quercetin-3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside) (4) and 
epi-catechin (5) were recently described for this species.10,13 
Isolated compounds were identified by direct comparison 
with authentic samples (1)8 and with data registered in the 
literature (2, 4 and 5).14-16
LAEMIL was prepared according to the traditional use 
of the species, as described by Carlini,2 and was submitted 
to chromatography on a poliamide column eluted with a 
gradient of water and methanol, affording 5 fractions (F1 - F5). 
On concentration of F1, the poliol galactitol (dulcitol) (6) 
crystallized out, being identified as the major constituent 
and representing about 75% of LAEMIL. F2 and F3, after 
successive fractionations on Sephadex LH-20 and silica gel 
columns, besides recrystallization, afforded the previously 
known tri-glycoside 1 along with the tetra-glycoside 
kaempferol-3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-O-[b-D-
arabinopyranosyl(1→3)-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)]-
O-b-D-galactopyranoside (3) which, when firstly isolated 
from M. ilicifolia leaves, represented a novel compound and 
was fully characterized, chemically and spectrometrically.8
LAEMIL and the fractions from the poliamide column 
(F1 - F5) were analyzed by TLC and RP-HPLC, employing 
compounds 1–5 as chemical markers. Flavonoid glycosides 
1 and 3 showed close retention times (RT = 21.75 and 
21.66 min) when injected separately, while for 2, 4 and 
5 very distinct peaks were observed (RT = 24.22, 22.75 
and 14.92 min, respectively). A mixture of compounds 
1-5, analyzed in the same conditions, displayed only 
4 peaks with superposition of the signals of 1 and 3 
(RT = 21.96 min). The HPLC fingerprint obtained 
for LAEMIL revealed an intense peak at 21.78 min, 
corresponding to the coelution of 1 and 3, besides peaks 
at 24.50, 22.86 and 15.07 min, which were attributed to 
compounds 2, 4 and 5, respectively. HPLC chromatography 
profiles registered for F1 - F5 (Figure 2), followed by co-
injection of each fraction with compounds 1-5, showed that 
F1 contains none of the chemical markers, a result further

1.0 mL/min; detection: UV-Vis, 254 nm.
Leite et al. 253Vol. 21, No. 2, 2010
confirmed by the absence of flavonoid spots on TLC plates. 
On the other hand, F2 and F3 showed intense peaks with RT 
at 21.72 and 21.75 min, corresponding to the kaempferol 
glycosides 1 and 3. Trifolin (2), hyperin (4) and epi-catechin 
(5) showed more intense peaks in F4 (RT 24.47, 22.70 and 
14.90 min, respectively) than in F5 (RT = 24.55, 22.83 
and 14.96 min). Proanthocyanidins were detected by TLC 
(spray reagent: 1% vanillin–methanol solution; eluent: 
8% hydrochloric acid–methanol) in fractions F4 and F5, 
but were not isolated in the present investigation although 
previously reported in M. ilicifolia.18
LAEMIL and the fractions derived from it (F1 - F5) 
were evaluated in rats for their effects on gastric secretion 
volume and pH (Table 1). A significant increase in gastric 
secretion volume and pH was observed for LAEMIL 
and these data were higher for F2 and F3 though they 
had been assayed in doses ten times smaller to that of 
LAEMIL. F1 and F4 did not differ significantly from the 
control group. In its turn, F5 increased the gastric secretion 
volume but no significant effect was observed on the pH. 
The biological profile observed for LAEMIL, F2 and F3 
on the gastric secretion volume and pH is similar to that 
originally obtained by our research group for a lyophilized 
aqueous extract (“abafado”) (170 mg/kg), which was shown 
to be comparable to those of cimetidine (50 mg/kg), a 
standard antiulcerogenic drug used as positive control.2-3 
LAEMIL was prepared according to Carlini’s recipe2 and 
the evaluation of the gastric secretion volume and pH was 
carried out at his own laboratory confirming its possible 
gastroproptective and antiulcerogenic effects. 
Conclusions
The flavonoid tri- and tetra-glycosides 1 and 3 obtained 
from a poliamide column of LAEMIL, and that are present 
in the active fractions F2 and F3, may be the main phenolic 
constituents responsible for the gastroprotective effect of M. 
ilicifolia leaves. These two phenolics can be considered as 
the chemical and pharmacological markers for an aqueous 
extract of M. ilicifolia leaves and their signals clearly stand 
out in its HPLC chromatography profile. Compounds 2, 4, 
5 and proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) would make 
a less important contribution to LAEMIL gastroprotective 
effect since they have been shown to be predominant in 
F4 and F5 which have not disclosed significant activity on 
gastric volume and pH of rats. Finally, a contribution of 
galactitol for the gastroprotective/antiulcerogenic effect of 
this plant species should not be underestimated once it is the 
major constituent of LAEMIL (75%) and therefore could 
influence the absorption of the active compounds, since it 
is used in the production of slow release microcapsules of 
antiulcer drugs.
