Piazza* and James A. HolzwarthU.S. Department of Agriculture, Eastern Regional Research Center, 600 East Mermaid Lane,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19118ABSTRACTA latex pellet fraction from Euphorbia lathyris incorporatesmevalonate into triterpenols and their fatty acid esters. Conditionsfor improved incorporation were determined. CaCI2 or CaCI2 plusMnCI2 sfimulated biosynthesis, and the metal ion chelator, ethyl-enebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA) enhanced stim-ulation. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was almost as effectiveas EGTA, but phthalic acid and citric acid were relatively poorsfimulators. The concentration of the Ca2 -EGTA complex wasdirectly measured, and the incorporation data are best fitted bya curve that shows that the receptor for the complex is saturable.In the presence of the metal-chelate complex, the addition offructose, 1,6-bisphosphate plus aldolase (triose-P) or malate pro-vided additional stimulation. Incorporation was maximum at 40micromolar R-mevalonate, and inhibition occurred at higher con-centrations. The apparent Km for R-mevalonate was 15 micromo-lar. Under improved reaction conditions, the rate of triterpenoidbiosynthesis from mevalonate is 25 times faster than was previ-ously observed (GJ Piazza, EJ Saggese, KM Spletzer [1987] PlantPhysiol 83: 177-180).conditions. At an early stage in this investigation, the use ofisopentenyl-PP as a precursor was ruled out because the latexpellet contains phosphatase activity, and the two most com-monly used phosphatase inhibitors, sodium fluoride and so-dium molybdate, were found to be inhibitory toward thebiosynthesis of triterpenoids from mevalonate.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsR-[5-3H]mevalonic acid, triethyl ammonium salt (27.6 Ci/mmol) was from Dupont NEN Research Products. DL-Mev-alonic acid, dibenzylethylenediamine salt was from Calbi-ochem. EGTA and KH-phthalate were from Kodak. EDTA(gold label) was from Aldrich. Isocitric acid (trisodium salt)was from ICN Pharmaceuticals. All other biochemical re-agents were from Sigma. Metabolites were purchased as theirsodium salts, except a-glycerol-P was the di(mono-cyclohexylammonium) salt.The tapped latex of Euphorbia lathyris can convert acetateto several structurally different tetracyclic triterpenes (cycloar-tenol, 24-methylene cycloartenol, euphol, lanosterol, and anisomer of lanosterol) (5). In prior studies, two major classesof triterpenes were found to be synthesized in vitro: triterpen-ols (TOH') and their fatty acid esters (TE) (5). Biosyntheticactivity was optimum in diluted latex with 0.4 M sorbitol asa component of the diluting buffer, indicating that an osmot-ically sensitive organelle is involved in biosynthesis. Ponsinetand Ourisson (8) have shown that simple low speed centrifu-gation of the latex from several Euphorbia species disruptsbiosynthesis when acetate is the precursor, presumably byseparating portions of the biosynthetic pathway. The pelletfrom such a simple centrifugation will incorporate mevalonateinto triterpenes.The latex pellet affords a convenient system for the assess-ment of inhibitors or stimulators of plant triterpenoid biosyn-thesis (7). However, a systematic investigation ofthe influenceof reaction conditions on reaction rate has never been con-ducted. It is reported here that significant enhancement ofmevalonate utilization can be achieved by using appropriate'Abbreviations: TOH, triterpenols; TE, fatty acid esters of triter-penols; FBP, 1-fructose, 1,6-bisphosphate.681Triterpene Biosynthesis AssayLatex was collected from Euphorbia lathyris, and the latexpellet was prepared as previously described (7). Briefly, freshlytapped latex (100 ,L per assay) was diluted threefold with ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM NaOH-KHphthalate (pH 5.5),0.4 M sorbitol, 30 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM KCI.The diluted latex was centrifuged at 8800g for 5 min (includ-ing starting and stopping time) in an Eppendorf model 5413desk top centrifuge. The supernatant was removed and ex-tracted with diethyl ether to give carrier triterpenes. The pelletwas resuspended in reaction buffer containing 10 mM Mes-NaOH (pH 6.5) and 0.4 M sorbitol. Each assay contained 10,uCi R-[5-3H]mevalonic acid, and if necessary unlabeled DL-mevalonic acid was added to raise the concentration as indi-cated in the text, assuming that only one isomer was utilized.The pH of all chelator solutions was adjusted to 6.5 withNaOH. All reactions were conducted in disposable borosili-cate glass culture tubes (12 x 75 mm). The reaction volumewas 0.25 mL, and the reaction time was 3 h. Data wereanalyzed as before and compared to a control set at 100%.All errors are reported as standard errors except as indicated.One-half of selected samples of triterpenols were subjected to2 Reference to brand or firm name does not constitute endorsementby the U.S. Department of Agriculture over others of a similar naturenot mentioned. www.plantphysiol.orgon May 8, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1989 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The radioactivity recoveredby collecting the peaks corresponding to the endogenoustriterpenols was 80 to 1 10% of the injected radioactivity. Thepattern oflabeling was very insensitive to reaction conditions;under very high rate conditions the radiolabel was somewhatmore evenly distributed between the individual triterpenols.Calcium Ion MeasurementsFree Ca2 concentration was measured directly in latexpellet fractions using a Radiometer calcium ion selectrode (F2112 Ca) with a SCE type calomel electrode (K 4040) asreference. Calibration curves were insensitive to the presenceof Mg2', but were shifted in the presence of free Mn2. Thecalcium-chelator concentration is equal to the decrease in freeCa2 upon the addition of chelator.RESULTSInfluence of EGTAIn prior work, the latex pellet isolation buffer and thebiosynthesis buffer consisted of phthalate-NaOH containingsorbitol, KCI, MgCl2, and CaCl2 (7). The phthalate buffer waschosen because its pK,, was in the range of interest and becauseit did not interfere with analysis of tricarboxylic acids. Sincea study of the influence of ions upon biosynthesis was one ofthe goals of this project, attempts were made to isolate thelatex pellet in Mes-sorbitol with no added ions; ion salts wereadded later in the biosynthesis reaction. Observed biosynthesiswas very poor, and ion effects were not reproducible betweenlatex batches. Presently there is no marker for the site oftriterpene biosynthesis, except biosynthesis per se. Thereforeit was not possible to know whether the poor results werecaused by a failure in the isolation procedure or by poorconditions for biosynthesis. Subsequently, the latex pellet wasisolated in phthalate-sorbitol with ions, as before; after resus-pending the latex pellet in Mes-sorbitol, ion salts were againtested. Biosynthesis was generally poor under most testedconditions. (The possibility that Mes was inhibitory was elim-inated by adding it to the phthalate biosynthesis buffer.) Inexamining the results it was noted that when EGTA wasadded to the Mes-sorbitol reaction buffer, biosynthesis wasgenerally higher. Due to this observation, experiments wereconducted over a range ofEGTA concentrations; no ion saltswere present, except for those carried over from the isolationbuffer. As shown in Figure 1 (circles) the addition of EGTAremarkably stimulated biosynthesis.Ion SaltsIt was not known whether EGTA was functioning to stim-ulate biosynthesis by chelating trace amounts of highly inhib-itory ions or working by another mechanism. It was reasonedthat if EGTA were acting only in the former way, then theaddition of EGTA-binding salts would cause inhibition be-cause these salts would compete with inhibitory ions forbinding to EGTA. As shown in Table I, most tested ionseither inhibited or did not stimulate, but both CaCl2 andMnCl actually enhanced biosynthesis over that given byEGTA alone.

Without theaddition of EGTA or salts the incorporation rates were TOH, 0.028to 0.57 and TE, 0.10 to 0.27 pmol h-1 mg-' protein.EGTA is not due merely to the removal of inhibitory ions,some component of the reaction mixture must also be actingto alter the rate of biosynthesis. It should be noted that in thisexperiment, control levels ofTE predominated over TOH by4.3 ± 0.4 (SE), N = 15). Although the salts FeCl3 and NaB407caused TOH levels to be higher than the control, the decreasein TE more than compensated for this; overall biosynthesiswas reduced to 90% (FeCl3) and 56% (NaB407) of the controllevel. Clearly these salts can influence the partitioning ofcarbon between the two major classes of triterpenes in latex,but they are not stimulators of biosynthesis.Figures 2 and 3 report complete concentration curves ofCaCl2 and MnCl2 with EGTA fixed at a concentration of 10mM. While CaCl2 stimulated both TE and TOH biosynthesisequally, MnCl2 enhanced TOH biosynthesis more than TEbiosynthesis. When no ions are added, the absolute rate ofTE synthesis predominates by a factor of 4 to 10 over TOHbiosynthesis. Thus when the concentration ofMnCl2 is greaterthan 10 mm, the absolute rate of TOH biosynthesis becomesapproximately equal or greater than TE biosynthesis.Metal lon-Chelator ComplexThe influence of changing EGTA concentrations in thepresence of fixed levels of CaCl2 or the combination of CaCl2and MnCl. is shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the curve ofEGTA alone, the added ion salts stimulated only at relativelyhigh levels of EGTA.

Figure 4 shows thata replot of the rates of TE and TOH biosynthesis versus theconcentration of Ca2t-EGTA is well fitted by a computer-generated binding curve that assumes that only one type ofbinding site is present, and that the binding sites are nonin-teractive. The apparent dissociation constant of Ca2+-EGTAfrom the site of either TOH or TE biosynthesis is about 11mM.EGTA has a good affinity for Mn2+, and it is likely thatMnCl2 is also acting through its complex with EGTA. Asshown in Figure 1, the effectiveness of MnCl2 as a stimulatorincreases as EGTA is increased. However free Mn2+ inhibitsbiosynthesis when no EGTA is added (Fig. 1), and inhibitionby free Mn2+ (above 1 mm concentration) was observed whenCa2t-EGTA was kept fixed at 5 mm (data not shown). Sinceinhibition by free Mn2+ complicates data analysis, furtherexperimentation was not performed.I,, A comparison of four chelators is shown in Table II.

Data are the mean of three repetitions. b Apparent cal-cium binding equilibrium constants were calculated according to (6)using data from (10).Phosphorylated Compounds and Organic AcidsMalate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) plus aldolasestimulated biosynthesis (Table III). Aldolase alone was veryslightly inhibitory. Presumably, NAD(P)H is generated at thesite of synthesis via malate dehydrogenase or malic enzymeand by triose-P dehydrogenase. The action of malic enzymein the production ofpyruvate and NADPH has been proposedas the source of reducing power for lipid biosynthesis indeveloping soybean seeds (1). Sometimes it was observed thatthe addition of FBP plus aldolase on top of malate gave nomore stimulation than malate alone. Since triose-P can yieldATP through the concerted action of dehydrogenase andphosphoglycerate kinase, but malate can only produceNAD(P)H, it is concluded that endogenous ATP levels canbe sufficient in some latex samples.Mevalonate ConcentrationFigure 5 shows the effect of increasing mevalonate concen-tration on biosynthesis. Maximum biosynthesis was achievedat 30 to 40 ,uM mevalonate. Maximum incorporation into TEplus TOH is about 75 pmol hr-' - mg-' protein when malateand triose-P are added. Without these additions the maximumrate of biosynthesis is reduced by a factor of about 2. Whenthe mevalonate concentration is higher than 40 ,uM, the rateof biosynthesis decreases, probably as a result of enzymeinhibition by excessively high intermediate levels. An estimateofKm can be obtained by replotting the data in inverse form.The mean Km given by all four curves is 15 ±44zM (SD). Thisvalue compares favorably with the lower estimates for the Kmof isolated mevalonate kinase, the first enzyme of the biosyn-thetic pathway: rat ovary, 1.8 AM; pig liver, 9.3 AM; Euglenagracilis, 30 AM; Hevea brasiliensis, 75 AM; Sarcophaga bullata,310 AM; rabbit liver, 2600 AM (9).DISCUSSIONUnder optimal conditions total triterpenoid biosynthesislies in the range of 75 to 100 pmol hr-' mg-' protein (Fig. 5684 Plant Physiol.

In each assay the latex pellet fraction wasderived from 100 gL of whole latex and contains approxi-mately 0.1 mg protein. Thus, the rate of biosynthesis can alsobe expressed as 75 to 100 pmol hrC' mL-' latex. From Figure2 ofNemethy et al. (5), the rate of biosynthesis in whole latexwith 0.3 mm acetate is 165 pmol hr-1 mL-' latex (0-3 h).However, another worker has reported rates of biosynthesisfrom acetate approximately 7-fold higher (12) (Table II).Therefore, the incorporation capacity of the isolated latexpellet is 10 to 60% of whole latex. The best incorporationrates for the latex pellet reported here are about 25 timesfaster than those previously reported by this laboratory.There is a large body of data indicating that changes incalcium concentration can influence cellular metabolism (1 1).It is possible that the rate of latex triterpenoid biosynthesis iscontrolled by calcium in vivo in conjunction with a putative"natural" chelator. The advantage of having the complex asthe active species, rather than free Ca2", is that the cytoplasmicconcentration of free Ca2+ can be kept very low. The role thatcalcium might play in biosynthesis is unknown. However,those enzymes directly involved in the isoprenoid pathwaythat have been studied in vitro do not require Ca2-. Thereforeit is tentatively concluded that calcium interacts with biosyn-thesis indirectly. Possible sites of action could include mem-brane ion pumps or enzymes involved with the generation ofreducing power.We have suggested that triterpene biosynthesis in the latexpellet fraction occurs in an organelle (7). The evidence forthis is as follows: (a) good biosynthesis requires the presenceof 0.4 M sorbitol, presumably to regulate osmotic pressure; (b)the site of synthesis can be pelleted by low speed centrifuga-tion; and (c) when centrifugation is conducted at forces above20,000g, biosynthesis is lost, presumably because the site ofsynthesis is damaged. The data presented here are consistentwith the notion that the site of biosynthesis is a vesiculatednonporous membrane structure. Particularly striking is theobservation that exogenously added ATP, Mg2+-ATP (datanot shown), or NADPH do not stimulate biosynthesis, al-though they are directly utilized by the isoprenoid pathway.Thus it appears that the membrane of the putative latexorganelle selectively admits external metabolites. The mem-brane of the chloroplast is also known to be selective andcontains transporters that are specific for certain types ofsubstances, e.g. phosphate or phosphorylated metabolites,dicarboxylic acids, and adenosine phosphates (4).Although the chelator-ion complex may be transported, itis important to remember that the data indicate only that theCa2+-chelator receptor is saturable (Fig. 4). Several years agoit was discovered that EDTA strongly stimulated photosyn-thesis in isolated chloroplasts from sunflower and wheat (3).The idea that EDTA was passing through the membrane wasnot considered. It was suggested that EDTA was complexingcations on the chloroplast envelope because the addition ofdivalent cations along with EDTA results in inhibition. Un-fortunately, the divalent ions were added in large excess overEDTA yielding a high concentration of free cations. Since thefree cations are by themselves inhibitory, it is not possible totell if the ion-chelator complex would provide stimulation.Thus, it remains unclear whether there is any similarity in themechanism of chelator action with regard to chloroplastsmetabolism and triterpenoid biosynthesis.In conclusion, good triterpenoid biosynthesis can beachieved in the latex pellet fraction when appropriate ingre-dients are added to the reaction mixture. Key ingredients areCaCl2 and MnCl2 together with a carboxylate chelator. Malateor malate plus triose-P are also beneficial. The optimal R-mevalonate concentration is about 40 AM.LITERATURE CITED1.
