Nearly all of the studies are focused on the extract and/or low molecular weight ingredients inthe areca nut. The purpose of this report is to identify the major protein component in the areca nut. After ammonium sulfatefractionation, the concentrated areca nut extract is subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. A colored protein is eluted atlow NaCl concentration and the apparently homogeneous eluent represents the major protein component compared to the arecanut extract. The colored protein shares partial sequence identity with the royal palm tree peroxidase and its peroxidase activityis confirmed using an established assay. In the study, the natural substrates of areca nut peroxidase are identified as catechin,epicatechin, and procyanidin B1. The two former substrates are similarly oxidized to form a 576 Da product with concomitantremoval of four hydrogen atoms. Interestingly, oxidation of procyanidin B1 occurs only in the presence of catechin or epicatechinand an additional product with an 864 Da molecular mass. In addition, procyanidin B1 is identified as a peroxidase substrate forthe first time.1. IntroductionAccording to the Taiwan Cancer Registry annual report(Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan) in 2009, theannual incidence of oral malignancy was 6,480 cases with amedian age of 53 years, an increase of 699 cases from 2008.Oral cancer had become the fifth leading cause of tumors inTaiwan, preceded by malignancies of the colon, liver, lung,and breast.More than 90% of the new incidences (5927 cases)in 2009 were in males, who engage in chewing the areca nut.For males in Taiwan, this malignancy represented the fourthprimary cause of death and occurred at an average age of 55years. Epidemiological studies and statistical analyses clearlydemonstrated that the development of oral cancer in Taiwanwas highly associated with chewing the areca nut, smoking,and wine consumption [1]. Chewing the areca nut wrappedin the Piper betle leaf, which is coated with slaked lime, ispopular in Taiwan, especially in the southeastern region. Ithas been estimated that there were at least two million out of23 million residents in Taiwan who were areca nut chewers.Approximately 90% of oral cancer patients in Taiwan haveparticipated in this practice.2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineThe areca nut is the seed of the palmplantAreca catechu L.and is rich in alkaloids, including arecoline, arecaidine,guvacine, and guvacoline. Sundqvist et al. demonstratedthat the aqueous extract and the above four alkaloids fromthe areca nut are highly cytotoxic and genotoxic to humancultured cells and have the potential to induce tumors [2].Additionally, several reports have shown the association ofchewing areca nuts with the development of various disor-ders, such as cardiovascular disease [3], metabolic syndrome[4], and hypertension [5]. In spite of these various harmfulproperties, the areca nut is still used in traditional Chinesemedicine and in India. It was found to be a highly effectivetreatment for human taeniasis [6] and increasedmemory andlearning in a rat model [7].Apart from the numerous studies on small-moleculeingredients in the areca nut, little is known about the proteincomponents, which is the focus of this report.Themajor pro-tein component in the areca nut was purified as an apparentlyhomogeneous product and found to be a peroxidase, whoseactivity was subsequently revealed.The natural substrates forthe areca nut (AN) peroxidase were also demonstrated in thisstudy.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Reagents. Areca nut was obtained from a local supplierin northern Taiwan. DEAE- (diethylaminoethyl-) cellulosewas purchased fromWhatman, Inc. (Clifton, NJ). Prestainedprotein marker was obtained from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot,Germany). Guaiacol, (+)-catechin, and (−)-epicatechin wereobtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis,MO). PNGaseF was purchased from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, UK).Procyanidins B1 and B2 were obtained from Extrasynthese(Genay, France), and sinapinic acid (SA) and 𝛼-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) were purchased from BrukerDaltonics, Inc. (Bremen, Germany).2.2. Single-Column Purification of the Major Protein Compo-nent in the Areca Nut. The following protocol was performedat room temperature. Areca nut (330 g) was homogenizedwith 1 liter of buffer A (20mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0). Thehomogenate was filtered and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for20min at 4∘C, and the clear supernatant was filtered again.Proteins in the areca nut (AN) extract were fractionatedwith 80% ammonium sulfate and centrifuged. The proteinprecipitate was redissolved in buffer A and dialyzed againstbuffer A overnight. The dialysis step was repeated once,and the dialyzed sample was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulosecolumn preequilibrated with buffer A. After loading, thecolumnwas washed with 100mL of buffer A, and the proteinsin the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 1MNaClbuffer A. A brown-colored protein was eluted at a lowconcentration of NaCl.2.3. Protein Identification byMALDI-TOF-TOFMS. Thepro-tein band on the SDS-PAGE gel was excised, followed by in-gel digestion and peptide extraction according to the protocoldescribed previously [8]. MS spectra were acquired withMALDI-TOF-TOF MS (Ultraflex III TOF/TOF, Bruker Dal-tonics, Inc.) equipped with a smartbeam laser. For digestedpeptide analysis, a CHCA matrix (1mg/mL in 50% acetoni-trile containing 0.1% TFA) was mixed with an equal volumeof peptide sample on the MALDI sample plate and then air-dried. The spectra were recorded in reflector mode using anacceleration voltage of +20 kV and a 20 ns delay time. IntenseMS peaks were selected forMS/MS analysis and peptidemassfingerprinting (PMF). The precursor mass window was setat ±0.45% of the precursor mass. The peak list from the MSspectra was processed by FlexAnalysis v.3.0 software (BrukerDaltonics, Inc.). The extracted peak list was comparedagainst the NCBInr database (release 20101220) using MAS-COT v.2.2.04 (Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters wereselected as follows: taxonomy-Viridiplantae (green plants);enzyme-trypsin; fixed modification-carbamidomethyl (C);variablemodification-oxidation (M,H,W); peptidemass tol-erance ± 100 ppm;MS/MS tolerance ± 0.5 Da; and significantthreshold 𝑃 < 0.05.The molecular mass of the purified protein was deter-mined in linear mode. Equal volumes (0.5𝜇L) of proteinsample and SA matrix (saturated in 30% acetonitrile and0.1% TFA) were mixed on a ground MALDI plate (BrukerDaltonics, Inc.). Protein mass calibration was performedusing a protein mixture kit II consisting of protein A[M+2H]2+, trypsinogen [M+2H]+, and protein A [M+2H]+(Bruker Daltonics, Inc.).2.4. Activity Assay and Zymogram of AN Peroxidase. ActivityofANperoxidasewas assayed bymeasuring the absorbance at470 nm in 20mM guaiacol and 5mM H2O2in 0.1M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.5). For peroxidase zymography, anative gel was used to analyze the purified protein withoutheating and addition of a reducing agent. After electrophore-sis, the gel was rinsed with water and immersed in 20mMguaiacol and 5mM H2O2in water. A brown color appearedshortly after the addition and indicated the presence ofperoxidase.2.5. Digestion of Glycosylated AN Peroxidase with PNGase F.The purified peroxidase (13 𝜇L) was mixed with 2𝜇L ofdenaturation buffer (10X) and heated in boiling water for10min. The following components were then added to themixture: 2 𝜇L of G7 reaction buffer (10X), 2 𝜇L of NP-40(10%), and 1 𝜇L of PNGase F (500U/𝜇L). The mixture wasincubated at 37∘C overnight or longer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands of interest were excised and analyzed byMALDI-TOF-TOF MS as mentioned above.2.6. Detection of Peroxidase Substrate(s) in Areca Nut Extractby LC-MS/MS. Wavelength scanning was initially employedto determine whether peroxidase substrate(s) existed in arecanut extract. In a 500𝜇L reaction vessel, 50𝜇L of arecanut extract was mixed with 5𝜇L of H2O, H2O2(0.5M), orguaiacol (2M), in 0.1M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.5).The absorbance of the whole mixture was then measured at380∼600 nm.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3An Atlantis T3 C18column (5𝜇m, 2.1×150mm) (WatersCorp., Milford, MA) was used to analyze the above areca nutextract using a linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.25mL/min.The mobile phases consisted of ddH2O (solvent A) andacetonitrile (solvent B), both of which contained 0.1% formicacid (v/v). HPLC separation was performed on a DionexUltimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific,Waltham, MA) equipped with a pump (DGP 3600M) and anautosampler (WPS-3000T). An ion trap mass spectrometerwith anESI source (HCTultra PTMDiscovery System, BrukerDaltonics, Inc.) was used for LC-MS full scan measurementsand LC-MS/MS experiments.The ESI source was operated inpositive ion mode with nitrogen as a nebulizing (50 psi) anddrying gas (10 L/min, 350∘C). MS and MS/MS were done inultrascan mode in the mass rangesm/z 100–800 andm/z 50–1000, respectively.2.7. Oxidation of Catechin, Epicatechin, and Procyanidin B1by AN Peroxidase. The following oxidation reaction wasperformed in 0.1M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at roomtemperature. In a 200 𝜇L reaction vessel, final concentrationsof 2mM H2O2and 0.5mM catechin or epicatechin weremixed with AN peroxidase for wavelength and time scanningand HPLC analysis monitored at 280 or 475 nm. A LiChro-CART column (4×250mm) (Merck & Co., Inc., WhitehouseStation, NJ) was used for separation with a linear gradient ata flow rate of 1mL/min. The above mobile phases (ddH2Oand acetonitrile) were used; however, no formic acid wasadded. For oxidation analysis of the third substrate, 0.1mMprocyanidinB1was used in the presence or absence of 0.2mMcatechin or epicatechin.3. Results3.1. Identification of Peroxidase as the Major Protein Com-ponent in the Areca Nut. As illustrated in Figure 1(a), SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a major protein product with amolecular mass of ∼55 kD in areca nut extract. A brown-colored protein was eluted early at a low concentrationof NaCl when performing DEAE-cellulose chromatography.The colored eluent consisted of the major protein productcharacterized by severe smearing in the SDS-PAGE gel(Figure 1(b)). The homogeneity of the purified protein wasfurther confirmed using PMF to analyze the upper andlower bands in the gel (Figure 1(b)). The same patterns wereobtained for both bands (Figure 1(c)). The colored proteinexhibited a maximum absorbance near 405 nm (Figure 1(d)),and MALDI-TOF analysis also displayed a smearing patternwith a 49 kD molecular mass (Figure 1(e)).MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometric analysis led tothe identification of two tryptic peptides with molecularmasses of 2308.131 and 1248.57Da (Figure 1(c)). Sequencesof both tryptic peptides (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) were foundto be identical with the amino terminus region of royalpalm tree (RPT) peroxidase, as shown by the underlining inFigure 2(c). Peroxidase activity of the purified protein wasfurther illustrated by measuring an absorbance increase at470 nm using guaiacol as the substrate in the presence ofhydrogen peroxide (Figure 2(d)).3.2. Dimerization and Glycosylation of AN Peroxidase.When performing peroxidase zymography, unexpectedlyslow migration of active peroxidase was observed (Fig-ure 3(a)), but it showed much higher activity at a higherpH (2 in Figure 3(a)). Compared to the Coomassie stainingpattern, it clearly showed that lower activity at neutral pHwasthe result of nearly complete dissociation of the peroxidasesubunits into inactive monomers (1 in Figure 3(b)), whereasthe interaction between subunits was stable at higher pH (2in Figure 3(b)). Therefore, the two identical subunits werenoncovalently associated to form an intact AN peroxidasewith full activity.AN peroxidase was structurally similar to RPT peroxi-dase, which has nine N-glycosylation sites [9]. The smearingpattern in the gel of AN peroxidase was most likely the con-sequence of high glycosylation. To confirm this hypothesis,AN peroxidase was digested to form products with partial orcomplete removal of N-linked oligosaccharides through 24and 48 h treatments with PNGase F (2 and 3 in Figure 3(c)).Two separate tryptic peptides in the intermediate and ung-lycosylated products were identified (Figure 3(d)) with thesame sequences as those in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). Clearly,different extents of AN peroxidase glycosylation resulted ina broad spectrum of molecular masses, especially becausethe glycan moiety was estimated to be more than half of theglycoprotein.3.3. Catechin, Epicatechin, and Procyanidin B1 Are Areca NutPeroxidase Substrates. When hydrogen peroxide was addedto the colorless extract of the areca nut, a slow color changefrom yellow to orange was observed, whereas addition ofguaiacol or water had no such effect. Wavelength scanningindicated a maximum absorbance for the mixture at 440 nm(Figure 4(a)), and the absorbance increases at the same wave-length were similar to those observed in the time scanning(Figure 4(b)). Comparison of the LC chromatograms clearlyindicated that the differences in the two components werecompletely removed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide(lower panel in Figure 4(c)). These two candidate substrateseluted at 7.4 and 8.3min and showedmolecular masses of 578and 290Da, respectively (upper panel in Figure 4(c)).Furthermore, theMS/MS spectrumof the substratewith a290Damolecular mass (Figure 5(a)) showed it to be catechinand epicatechin, both of which displayed indistinguishablespectra (Figures 5(b) and 5(c)). On the other hand, fragmentions in the MS/MS spectrum of the substrate with a 578Damolecular mass (Figure 5(d)) were very similar to those ofprocyanidin B1 (Figure 5(e)). These three components wererecognized as the natural substrates for AN peroxidase. Thestructures of catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B1 wereshown in Figure 5(f).3.4.

The spectra ofwavelength scanning for both reactions were similar tothat observed for the areca nut extract (Figure 4(a)). HPLCexamination of the oxidation reactions revealed that catechinand epicatechin were oxidized to a major product with adistinct retention time (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). The majoroxidized products, with the same molecular mass of 576Dafor both substrates, were undoubtedly the consequenceof condensation of two catechin or epicatechin moleculeswith the concomitant removal of four hydrogen atoms.While chewing the areca nut along with the Piper betleleaf in slaked lime in the oral cavity, the pH value of thecollected oral extracts usually fell between 8 and 9, in ourexperience. AN peroxidase still retained the ability to oxidizecatechin and epicatechin at pH 10, although to a lesser extentthan at neutral pH (Figures 6(c) and 6(d)). Under theseconditions, the substrates were spontaneously oxidized, andAN peroxidase accelerated the oxidation process.3.5. Occurrence of Procyanidin B1 Oxidation in the Presenceof Catechin or Epicatechin. Unlike catechin or epicatechin,there was no color change or spectrophotometric absorbanceincrease when using procyanidin B1 alone as a substrate.HPLC examination also indicated the lack of oxidation ofprocyanidin B1 alone (data not shown). The most strikingfeature of procyanidin B1 oxidation was that it occurred onlyin the presence of catechin or epicatechin. In contrast tospectra from conditions without enzyme (Figures 7(a) and7(c)), the HPLC chromatograms clearly indicated procyani-din B1 oxidation with the formation of additional products(Figures 7(b) and 7(d)).

(c) LC/MS analysis of the AN extract in the presence of water (upper panel) or hydrogen peroxide (lower panel).catechin homodimer, a product with an 864Da molecularmasswas formed in the presence of small amounts of catechin(Figure 7(b)).This product resulted from the condensation ofprocyanidin B1 with catechin with the concomitant removalof four hydrogen atoms.In the presence of epicatechin, similar reactions occurred,that is, production of an epicatechin homodimer andan epicatechin-procyanidin B1 heterodimer (Figure 7(d)).Clearly, procyanidin B1 oxidation occurred through thecondensation of onemolecule of catechin or epicatechin withprocyanidin B1 in place of the second molecule of catechinor epicatechin. However, a condensation reaction betweentwo molecules of procyanidin B1 was not observed in eithercases. Thus, the following reactions were indicated: catechin(or epicatechin) + procyanidin B1 + 2H2O2→ catechin-procyanidin B1 dimer (or epicatechin-procyanidin B1 dimer)+ 4H2O.4. DiscussionMost proteins in the areca nutwere found in trace amounts, asdetermined by SDS-PAGE, with the exception of peroxidase,which was identified as the major protein component in theexperiment. In addition to multiple N-glycosylation sites, aheme groupwas shown to exist in RPT peroxidase [10], whichhas a sequence similar to AN peroxidase (Figure 2(c)). Thesame prosthetic group, most likely resulting in the browncolor with amaximumabsorbance near 405 nm (Figure 1(d)),was found in AN peroxidase and therefore should be classi-fied under the family of heme peroxidases.AN peroxidase existed mainly as an inactive monomerat neutral pH (Figure 3(b)), while a small increase in pH,to 7.9, led to a dramatic structural change in which twoidentical subunits associated to form a fully active, intactprotein (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Such observations suggestedthat the active site of AN peroxidase was created only whentwo subunits were closely associated; that is, the active siteis located at the subunit interface. It was plausible that whenchewing areca nut in the oral cavity, AN peroxidase is a fullyactive dimer in the oral extract at alkaline pH. Similar to RPTperoxidase, secretory AN peroxidase belongs to the familyof class III plant peroxidases. However, AN peroxidase isstructurally distinct frommembers of this class, which are allknown as monomeric glycoproteins [9].Peroxidase stability apparently depends on the presenceof a carbohydrate moiety, as shown in studies of the recombi-nant protein [11, 12]. The extreme stability of AN peroxidaseat room temperature was attributed to the same factor in the8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine×1063.02.52.01.51.00.50120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280m/zIntensity123 139147165273291 [M + H]+(a)120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280m/z123139147165273×1072.01.51.00.50Intensity169Catechin(b)120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280m/z123139165273×1072.01.51.00.50Intensity169Epicatechin151249(c)Intensity579 [M + H]+8.06.04.02.00×105200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600m/z201 229247271291301409427439 453 543 561(d)×1071.51.00.50IntensityProcyanidin B1200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600m/z229247291301409427453 561275(e)Figure 5: Continued.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9HOHOOOOHOHOHOH OOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOHOOOHOHOHOH(+)-catechin (−)-epicatechin Procyanidin B1(f)Figure 5: Identification of the natural substrates in the areca nut.

HPLC chromatograms were obtained in the absence ((a) and(c)) or presence ((b) and (d)) of AN peroxidase. Products derived from condensation of procyanidin B1 with catechin or epicatechin wereindicated as B1-C (b) and B1-EC (d), respectively.PNGase F digestion experiment.The glycanmoiety alone hadamolecular mass greater than the unglycosylated apoenzymeitself (Figure 3(c)), suggesting distribution of glycans acrossthe surface of the whole holoenzyme molecule. The glycanmoiety affected not only the enzymatic activity of the ANperoxidase but also its conformational rigidity. Without heattreatment, AN peroxidase remained intact, even after longerexposure to PNGase F (data not shown).Peroxidase-mediated oxidation of catechins led to the for-mation of products with different degrees of polymerizationthrough condensation of an A ring from one unit and a Bring from the other [13]. Two catechin dimers were reportedto be the main products: colored dehydrodicatechin A andcolorless dehydrodicatechin B4,withmolecularmasses of 576and 578Da, respectively [14, 15]. Comparison of the fragmentions in positive mode revealed obvious differences in theMS/MS spectra between the observed catechin dimer (seeFigure S1A in supplementary Material available online athttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/412851) anddehydrodicatechinA (Figure S1C).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11Pourcel et al. proposed that the major oxidation productobtained with epicatechin alone was a yellow dimer nameddehydrodiepicatechin A [16]. However, theMS/MS spectrumof their proposed structure (compound 6 in Figure S1E) innegative mode was significantly different from that of theepicatechin dimer in the experiment (Figure S1E). Recently,Mouls and Fulcrand reported epicatechin oxidation anddemonstrated that the dimeric ions at m/z 579 and m/z 577represented B-type andA-type dehydrodicatechin structures,respectively [17]. Prior to oxidation, epicatechin was possiblyepimerized into catechin; thus, the same products wereobtained, which is likely in the case of catechin oxidation.Taken together, AN peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of cate-chin or epicatechinmight generate dimeric structures distinctfrom those mentioned above, as shown by the formation ofa major dimer with a different MS/MS spectrum. For thepositive and negative modes, the MS/MS spectra of dimersC-C and EC-EC were analogous (Figures S1A,B,D,E), andboth dimers had extremely similar structures.In addition to catechin and epicatechin, the areca nutcontained several procyanidins and their oligomeric forms[18, 19], one of which was procyanidin B1 (Figure S2A)and was identified as an AN peroxidase substrate in theexperiment. The inability of procyanidin B1 alone to beoxidized by AN peroxidase is consistent with the observationthat there was no procyanidin B1-B1 dimer product (Figures7(b) and 7(d)). The active site of AN peroxidase may consistof two portions, one of which had the ability to bind to largeroligomeric substrates. In contrast, the other could only bindto monomeric units, such as catechin or epicatechin, becausethere was not enough space in this position to accommodateprocyanidin B1 or the dimeric form of epicatechin andcatechin. Notably, AN peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation wasgreatly inhibited in the presence of procyanidin B2, whichis structurally similar to procyanidin B1; the difference isthe C-3 configuration of the C ring of the epicatechin unit(Figure S2B). The extent of inhibition was proportional tothe concentration of procyanidin B2 (Figures S2C,D). Thisobservation provided evidence that C-3 on the C ring of thecatechin unit in procyanidin B1 might serve as the criticalreactive site for coupling with catechin or epicatechin.There are reports indicating the presence of peroxidasein the seeds of other plants, such as soybean [20], apple,and orange [21]. Egley et al. demonstrated the possiblerole of peroxidase in contributing to the formation of awater-impermeable seed coat [22]. The proposed function ofperoxidase is also consistent with the ability of peroxidaseto form an insoluble polymer using soluble phenolics. Inthis study, distribution of AN peroxidase was also evaluatedusing zymography to examine the oral extract of the samechewer. As depicted in Figure S3 in the supplementarydata, AN peroxidase was most abundant in the areca nutcoat (2), at levels comparable to or even more than theamounts in the intact areca nut alone (3) or the areca nutwrapped with a Piper betle leaf coated with slaked lime (4).Notably, an additional peroxidase was detected, to a lesserextent, in the presence of Piper betle leaf (4);that is, twodistinct peroxidases simultaneously acted on the oral cavityin this situation. The presence of the other peroxidase wasundoubtedly the consequence of chewing Piper betle leafcoated with slaked lime (5).In summary, further investigations remain concerningthe oxidation of epicatechin and procyanidin B1, especiallyfor the latter in the presence of catechin or epicatechin.The subject is significant to explain the inhibitory effect ofprocyanidin B2 on the oxidation of catechin, epicatechin,and procyanidin B1. The next goal will be to research theperoxidase in the Piper betle leaf. Due to the absence of acolor change when adding hydrogen peroxide to Piper betleleaf extract, we are also searching for natural substrates inaddition to the three mentioned above.AbbreviationsAN: Areca nutCHCA: 𝛼-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acidSA: Sinapinic acidDEAE: DiethylaminoethylTFA: Trifluoroacetic acid.Conflict of InterestsAll authors have reviewed this paper, agreedwith its contents,declared that they do not have any conflict of interests on thesubject matter or materials in the research, and approved itssubmission for publication consideration.Authors’ ContributionYu-Ching Liu and Chao-Jung Chen have contributed equallyto this work.References[1] Y.
