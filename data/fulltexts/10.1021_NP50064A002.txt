STEIN Dipartimento di Studi Farmareutiri, Uniuersita degfi Studi “La Sapimza, “ P .  fe  Aldo Moro 5 .  00185 Roma, Italy ABSTRACT.-A reinvestigation of the bark of Uncaria tommtosa afforded, in addition to the major quinovic acid glycosides 1-3, three further glycosides 4-6. The structures were elucidated by spectral and chemical studies. Furthermore, a series of antiviral tests were per- formed on all these glycosides and on the related glycosides 7-9, previously isolated from Guet- tar& platypoda. Uncaria tomentosa (Willd.) DC., commonly known as “una de gato,” is used in tra- ditional Peruvian medicine for the treatment of arthritis, gastritis, cancer, and certain epidermic diseases, in the form of an aqueous extract of the bark. The aqueous or EtOH extract of this plant was shown to have cytostatic, contraceptive, and anti-inflammatory activity (1). A number of alkaloids displaying a pronounced enhancement of phagocytosis were isolated (2), while no phytochemical or pharmacological work has been done on the nonalkaloidal constituents. As part of a series of studies on Rubiaceae of South American flora used in local medicine ( 3 4 ,  we recently have isolated three new quinovic acid glycosides 1-3 from U .  tomentosa (5) and seven quinovic acid glycosides from Guettardaplatypoda DC. (4,6). All these glycosides showed varied structures among which four groups can be dis- cerned, including glycosides having a c-3, aC-28, a c-3,28, or a c-3,27 glycosylation pattern. The last group of compounds has not previously been reported in nature. Various biological activities have been described for triterpenoid saponins (7). However, little is known regarding antiviral activity, which was reported for the glycoside glycyrrhizin (8), glycyrrhetinic acid (9), and some other triterpenoids ( 10) that were found to inhibit the multiplication of some DNA viruses. In this paper we report a reexamination of a much larger sample of U .  tomentosa that afforded, in addition to the major compounds 1-3, three minor compounds 4-6. W e  also conducted an investigation on the possible antiviral activity of the above com- pounds against two RNA viruses: a minus-strand RNA virus (vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) and aplus-strand RNA virus (rhinovirus type lB, HRVlB). The antiviral tests have been performed also on the related glycosides 7-9, previously isolated from G. platypoda. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The CHCI3-MeOH (9: 1) extract of the bark of U .  tomentosa afforded, in addition to the major glycosides 1-3 ( 5 ) ,  three other quinovic acid glycosides 4 ,  5 ,  and 6 ,  the last one occurring in very minor amount.

The fabms, in negative ion mode, of 4 and 5 showed the same fragmentation pattern (Table 1). Both compounds gave a quasi-molecular anion at mlz 793 [also ob- served in the spectrum of 3 (3)1, a fragment at m/z 647 [(M - H) - 146)- suggesting the loss of a deoxyhexose without the glycosidic oxygen, a fragment at mlz 615 [(M - H) - 178)- resulting from the cleavage of a glucose with the glycosidic oxygen, and a fragment at mlz 63 1 [(M - H) - 162)- corresponding to the loss of a glucose without the glycosidic oxygen or to the loss of a deoxyhexose with the glycosidic oxygen. Start- ing from the 647 ,63  1, and 6 15 peaks, the facile loss of a carboxyl group, observed also in the fabms spectra of other quinovic acid glycosides (M), led to peaks at mlz 604, 587 and 57 1, respectively. Other fragments at mlz 441 and 425 were ascribable to the decarboxylated aglycone and were also present in the spectra of 1-3 (5). mlz mlz 793 647 63 1 615 60 3 587 57 1 44 1 425 [M - HI- [(M - H) - 1461- [(M - H)  - 1621- [(M - H) - 1781- [(M - H) - (44 + 146)I- [(M - H) - (44 + 162)I- [(M - H) - (44 + 178)I- 603 - 162 or 587 - 146 603 - 178or 587 - 162 p 44 1 6 [M - HI- [(M - H) - 162)- [(M - H) - 1781- [(M - H) - (44 + 162)I- [(M - H) - (44 + 178)l- [(M - H)- (2 X 162)]- [(M - H) - (162 + 178)I- %e mass unit lost corresponded to fragments indicated in the text. The molecular formula C4$&14 for 4 and 5 was deduced by fabms and DEPT I3C nmr. The quinovic acid structure of the aglycone and the substitution pattern of 4 and 5 followed from the nmr data. All aglycone carbon and proton signals could be as- signed by comparison with the spectra of the related quinovic acid glycosides 1-3 (5). Particularly the aglycone spectral data for 4 and 5 (Table 2 and 3) closely resembled those of 2 .  The presence in 4 and 5 of a sugar unit linked at a carboxyl group (C-27 or C- 28) of the aglycone was derived by the 'H-nmr signal at 6 5.41 ( l H ,  d , J =  7.5 Hz) (anomeric hydrogen) and by the l3C-nmr signal at 95.8 pprn (anomeric carbon) (4,5,11). The glycosyl ester linkage was proposed to be at C-28 of quinovic acid on the basis oftheresonancesofC-12, C-13, andC-14(130.1, 134.4, 59.3ppm, respective1y)and of C-27 (179.5 ppm) and C-28 (178.5 ppm) carboxyl groups. All these values matched well with those found in a C-28 glycosyl ester like 2 ,  while in a C-27 glycosyl ester like 1 the C-12, C-13, and C-14 resonated at 130.8, 133.7, and 57.7 ppm, respectively, and C-27 and C-28 were shifted at 178.1 and 182.0 ppm, respectively (5). Also in agreement with a C-28 glycosylated quinovic acid structure, the 'H-nmt signals of H- 12 (6 5.59, l H ,  m) and ofMe-26 (6 0.89, 3H,  s) were virtually unshifted with respect to 2, whereas in 1 the H-12 and Me-26 signals appeared at 6 5.62 ( lH,  m) and at 6 0.92 (3H, s), respectively (5). C-3 of quinovic acid as the ether glycosidation site was derived from the "C-nmr signal at 90.7 pprn (CH by DEPT) (5,12). For the sugar moiety the 'H- and 13C-nmr spectra confirmed the presence of a glu- cose and a fucose in 5 and of a glucose and a quinovose in 4 ,  also derived by fabms spectra and by the results of methanolysis; they proved that all the sugars were occur- ring in the P-D-pyranosyl form (13). It remained, therefore, to establish the relative 68 2 4 Journal of Natural Products [Vol. 52, No. 4 5 6 Me-23 (3H, s) . . . . . . . . .  Me-26 (3H, s) . . . . . . . . .

The alkaline hydrolysis o f 4  and 5 yielded quinovic acid-3P- 0-P-D-quinovopyanoside and quinovic acid-3~-0-P-~-fucopyranoside, respectively (see Experimental), whose 'H- and 13C-nmr spectra showed no signals ascribable to a glucose in an ester linkage but exhibited the signals ascribable to a P-D-quinovo- pyranose and to a P-D-fucopyranose, respectively, virtually unshifted with respect to 4 and 5 .  This finding clearly confirmed that the deoxyhexose unit was linked at C-3 and the glucose unit at C-28 of the aglycone. From all these data the structure quinovic acid-3P-0-(P-~-fucopyranosyl)-(28H l)-P-D-ghcopyranosy1 ester was assigned to 5, and the structure quinovic acid-3P-0-(P-D-quinovopyranosyl)-(28~ l)-P-D-ghco- pyranosyl ester was assigned to 4. On acid methanolysis and glc analysis, compound 6 gave a gc pattern characteristic of glucose. The fabms spectrum of 6 showed a quasi-molecular anion at m/z 809, corres- ponding to the molecular formula C4&6015, and a fragmentation pattern due to the subsequent loss of two hexose units (Table 1). Comparison of fabms and 'H-nmr spectral data of 6 with those of 4 and 5 (Tables 1-3) indicated a quinovic acid structure for the aglycone. The chemical shifts of the aglycone protons were superimposable on those of 4 and 5 except for the signals of Me- 23 (6 0.80, 3H, s) and Me-24 (6 0.99, 3H, s) which were shifted upfield by 0.05 ppm relative to Me-23 (6 0.85, 3H,  s) and Me-24 (6 1.04, 3H, s) in 4 and 5. These shifts were indicative of a quinovic acid derivative with a free 3P-hydroxyl group and with a C-28 glycosylated carboxyl group such as we have observed in a previ- ous study on G. platypodr (6). Moreover, for the sugar moiety, the signal at 6 5.42 ( lH, d ,  J = 7.5 Hz, anomeric hydrogen) was ascribable to a hexose (glucose by glc) linked at C-28 through an ester linkage, and the signal at 6 4.62 ( l H ,  d ,  J = 7 . 5  Hz, anomeric hydrogen) was due to another hexose (glucose by glc) unit. On the other hand, comparison of the spectral data of 6 with those ofquinovic acid- 3P-O-(P-D-glucopyranosyl)-(28Hl)-P-D-glucopyranosy1 ester indicated that the molecular formula, the fabms fragmentation pattern, and the results of the Jul-Aug 19891 Aquino et a / .  : Quinovic Acid Glycosides 68 3 Aglycone carbon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1  12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2 1  22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 TABLE 3.

The amount of compound 6 was insufficient for further investigation and the posi- tion of the interglycosidic linkage remained undefined. From the above findings the structure quinovic acid-(28* l)-P-D-glucopyranosy1 P-D-glucopyranosyl ester was as- signed to 6 .  An inhibitory effect against VSV infection was evident for all the nine compounds tested, although at relatively high concentrations with respect to the toxic dose (tox cso) for CER cell morphology and growth (Table 4). No relationship can be noted between the number of the sugar residues and the antiviral activity. The presence of the free C- 27 carboxyl group seems to be important; also the nature of the sugar moiety affects the activity, e.g., quinovose (in 4)  is better than fucose (in 5) ,  when all the other characters in the structure are the same. The most active compound is 3, with both carboxyl groups free. Almost all these quinovic acid glycosides were inactive against rhinovirus type 1B infection in HeLa cells; only 6 and 9, both containing two glucose units and the free C- 27 carboxyl group, reduced the viral cytopathic effect by 50% at 30 and 20 kg/ml, re- spectively. The maximum nontoxic concentration for HeLa cells of compound 6 was 60 pg/ml and of compound 9 was 100 pg/ml. 684 Journal of Natural Products [Vol. 5 2 ,  No. 4 TABLE 4.

PLANT MATERIAL.-The bark of U. tommtosu was collected at Lima, Peru, and identified by Ed- mundo Szeliga of the Instituto Peruano de Investigation Fitoterapica Andina. A voucher sample of the plant is deposited at the Herbarium of this Institute. EXTRACTION AND ISOLATION.-The extraction procedure has been described in a previous paper (5). The CHCI,-MeOH (9: 1) dried extract (10 g) was chromatographed on a Sephadex M - 2 0  column (100 X 4 cm), using MeOH as eluent. Fractions (8 ml) were eluted, analyzed by tlc on SiO, in n-BuOH- HOAc-H,O (60: 15:25), and similar fractions were combined. Fractions 25-27 (680 mg) were submitted to hplc on a C-18 p-Bondapack column (30 cm X 7.8 mm i.d.) using MeOH-H,O (65:35) (flow rate 3.5 mumin) as eluent to give four main fractions. The fraction collected after 10.4 min from injection con- tained glycoside 4 (20 mg), [a]', + 17" ( r =  1, MeOH). The fraction collected after 16.1 min contained glycoside 5 (16 mg), [a)" + 15"(r = 1, MeOH). The fraction collected after 23.5 min contained glucoside 3 (45 mg) (5). The fraction collected after 25.6 min contained glycoside 6 (2 mg). The fabms, 'H- and 13C-nmr spectra of 4-6 are in Tables 1-3. ACIDIC METHANOLYSIS OF COMPOUNDS &.-Methanolysis of each glycoside (0.5-1 mg) was ALKALINE HYDROLYSIS OF 4 AND S.-Compounds 4 (10 mg) and 5 (8 mg) were separately heated in 0.5 M aqueous KOH (1 ml) at 110" in a stoppered reaction vial for 2 h. The reaction mixture was ad- justed to pH 7 with HCI and then extracted with n-BuOH (5 ml). The organic phase was evaporated to dry- ness to give quinovic acid-3P-O-~-~q~inovopyranoside from 4 and quinovic acid-3P-O-P-~- fucopyranoside from 5; these compounds were identified by comparison with literature data (15,16) and by I3C-nmr data (CD,OD); all aglycone signals of these compounds were superimpable on those of glycoside 3 (5). Sugar signals of quinovic acid-3~-O-~-~quinovopyranoside: C-1' to C-6' 6 = 106.5 (CH), 76.0 (CH), 78.O(CH), 71.3 (CH), 77.1 (CH), 18.O(Me); sugarsignalsofquinovicacid-3P-0-P-m fucopyranoside: C-1' toC-6' 6 =  106.9(CH), 73.O(CH), 75.4(CH), 73.O(CH), 71.5 (CH), 17.2 (Me). CELL AND vIRUSES.-M-HeLa (17) and CER (18) cells were grown at 37" in Eagle's minimal essen- tial medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) and 6% newborn calf serum, respectively. Rhinovim type 1B was grown as described (19) and titrated in HeLa cells to estimate its tissue culture in- fectivity dose (tcid,,). VSV, Indiana serotype, was cultivated in CER cells and titrated by plaque assay as reported previously (20). achieved in the usual manner (14). ESTIMATION OF CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY IN UNINFECTED cEu.-HeLa (1 X lo4 celldwell) and CER (3.5 X lo3 cells/well) cells in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated in the presence of increas- ing concentrations ofeach compound for 2 days at 37". Cytotoxicity was monitored by two different assays: Jul-Aug 19891 Aquino et al. : Quinovic Acid Glycosides 685 by a daily microscope examination of cell morphology and by counting the cell number in untreated and drug treated cells on the second day of incubation. The viability of cells was checked by neutral red uptake. ANTI-RHINOVIRUS 1B BIOASSAY.-h 24-well plates 500 ~1 of twofold dilutions ofeach compound in maintenance medium (MEM 2% fcs) were added with 100 p1 ofvirus dilution containing 100 tcid,, and 400 p1 ofHeLa cells suspension (7.5 X lo5 celldml). Plates were shaken and incubated at 33" in a 5% CO, atmosphere; they were checked daily by light microscopy and read when virus controls (no drug) showed 100% cytopathic effect (cpe). The antiviral activity of the compounds was defined as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC,,) required to inhibit virus-induced cpe by 50%, when 100% ofcells were destroyed by the virus in the con- trol infected cultures. ANTI-VESICULAR STOMATITIS VIRUS BIOASSAY .-Confluent monolayers of CER cells in &well plates were infected with 200 ~l of a virus dilution containing approximately 100 plaque forming units (pfu). Following a 1 h adsorption period at 37", the cells were added with an overlay medium containing doubling concentrations of compounds and incubated until plaques developed ( 3 6 4 8  h at 37"). The antiviral activity of the compounds was expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC,,) required to reduce the plaque number by 50% with respect to control infected cells. The MIC,, value was calculated by plotting the percentage of plaque counts in drug-treated cells versus the logarithm of the compound concentration (Fg/ml).
