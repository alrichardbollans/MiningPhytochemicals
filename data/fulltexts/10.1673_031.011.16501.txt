Abstract
Use of insecticides can have disruptive effects on the environment. Replacing the chemical 
compounds in these insecticides with plant materials, however, can be a safe method with low 
environmental risk. In the current study, chemical composition and insecticidal activities of the 
essential oil from cardamom, Elettaria cardamomum L. (Maton) (Zingiberales: Zingiberaceae)
on the adults of three stored product pests was investigated. Results indicated that essential oil of 
E. cardamomum toxic to the bruchid beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus Fabricius (Coleoptera: 
Bruchidae), the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), and 
the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Adults of E. kuehniella were 
more sensitive than the Coleoptera. Also, the highest mortality of these insects was seen after 12 
hours. Results of the LT50 tests showed that the lethal time of mortality occurred between 10-20
hours in various test concentrations. Essential oil of E. cardamomum had a good efficacy on 
oviposition deterrence of C. maculatus females, too. The chemical constituents of the essential 
oils were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The major constituents of 
cardamom were identified as 1,8-cineol, -terpinyl acetate, terpinene and fenchyl alcohol. These 
results suggest that essential oil of E. cardamomum is a good choice for control of stored product 
pests.

Introduction
The use of synthetic insecticides in
agricultural pest control practices to increase 
yields and protect stored products may 
involve serious health hazards for organisms
in the class Mammalia. These insecticides are 
often associated with residuals that are 
dangerous for the consumer and the 
environment. In addition, the risk of 
developing insect resistance and the high 
cost–benefit ratio of synthetic pesticides 
pushes research towards investigating 
alternative insecticides. 
Aromatic plants, which are widespread in the
rich and diversified flora of Iran, are known
for their nutritional and medicinal 
characteristics. They are often found in
cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, as well as in 
industries such as pharmacology and food 
flavoring. In addition to antiseptic and 
fungicidal properties identified in many plants 
(Benjilali et al. 1984; Caccioni and Guizzardi 
1994; Dayal and Purohit 1971; Ghfir et al. 
1997; Mishra and Dubey 1994), it has been 
shown that many aromatic plant species and
their essential oils present a high level of 
efficiency in protecting crops and stored food 
against insect pests (Arnason et al. 1989; 
Bernard et al. 1995; Don-Pedro 1996; 
Mahmoudvand et al. 2011a, 2011b; Regnault-
Roger and Hamraoui 1993, 1995; Saxena 
1989). Plant material can also be effective as
oviposition deterrents (Abbasipour et al. 
2010) and antifeedants (Abbasipour et al.
2011). Essential oils have potential to be 
developed for use in insect control programs.
The cardamom, Elettaria cardamomum L.
(Maton) (Zingiberales: Zingiberaceae), called 
the "Queen of Spices" in India, is a tall,
perennial, reed–like herb that grows wild and 
is cultivated in India and Sri Lanka. 
Cardamom is an important economic crop and 
is a highly valued spice (Parthasarathy et al. 
2008). The essential oils have therapeutic
benefits (Lewis 1984; Nirmala 2000). Some 
studies showed that cardamom essential oils
have inhibitory effects against fungus growth 
(Utta-U´r et al. 2000) and marked 
antiapamodic, analgesic, and anti–
inflammatory activity (Al-Zuhair et al. 1996).
The characteristic flavors and odors 
emanating from the volatile oils of spices are 
known to have various effects on insect pests, 
including stored insects (Jacobson 1989; 
Shayya et al. 1991). The volatile oil from 
cardamom acts as a potential grain protectant
by killing various life stages of the stored 
product insects attacking wheat, such as
Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais,
via contact and fumigant action (Huang et al. 
2000). Kim et al. (2004) worked on the 
acaricidal activity of 56 plant essential oils on
the poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae,
and found that cardamone ceylon oil caused 
100% mortality on adult mites.
This study was undertaken to investigate E.
cardamomum essential oil composition. In 
addition, this paper describes for the first time 
the fumigation activity of the oil against three 
important stored products pests: the bruchid 
beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus Fabricius 
(Coleoptera: Bruchidae), the red flour beetle,
Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coloeptera:
Tenebrionidae) and the flour moth, Ephestia 
kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).
The effect of essential oils on oviposition 
deterrence of C. maculatus was also 
evaluated.Journal of Insect Science: Vol. 11 | Article 165 Abbasipour et al.

Materials and Methods
Extraction of the essential oil
The seeds of E. cardamomum were collected 
October 2009 for essential oil extraction.
Samples were shade dried at room 
temperature and were subjected to 
hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type 
apparatus (Cavalcanti et al. 2004). For
extraction of essential oils, 50 g of air–dried
seed material in water (1:12 w:v) was used,
with a distillation time of 4 hours. The oils 
were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate 
and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Essential oil 
yield was 4-7%.
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
analysis
The oil was analyzed using an Agilent HP-
5973 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 
www.agilent.com) equipped with a Shimadzu
QP-5000 (Quadruple) mass spectrometer
(www.shimadzu.com). The sample was 
diluted 25 times with acetone, and 1 μL was 
injected. A fused silica column SPB-1 (30 
m/250 mn, film thickness 0.25 μm) coated 
with polydimethyl siloxane was used. Helium 
was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
The injector port temperature was 225 °C, the 
detector temperature was 250 °C, and the 
oven temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 
1 min and then increased to 225 °C at the rate 
of 2 °C/min, at which temperature the column
was maintained for 5 min. The split ratio was 
1:25 and the ionization voltage was 70 eV. 
Unknown essential oil was identified by 
comparing its gas chromatography retention
time to that of known compounds and by 
comparison of its mass spectra, either with 
known compounds or published spectra.
Insect rearing
The insect colonies were reared under 27 ± 1
°C, 65 ± 5% RH, and darkness condition. 
Ephestia kuehniella flour and mung bean 
grains were used for rearing of T. castaneum
and C. maculatus, respectively. The second 
generations of the three insect species were
used for experiments.
Fumigant toxicity
The fumigant toxicity of essential oil on T.
castaneum and C. maculatus were tested in 70
mL glass vials, and 600 mL vials for E.
kuehniella. In each of them 10 adults (both 
sexes, male or female, 1-7 days old) were 
released. No. 1 Whatman filter paper disks 
(www.whatman.com) were cut to 2 cm in 
diameter and attached to the undersurface of 
glass vial screw caps. Filter papers were 
impregnated with series of pure 
concentrations of essential oil; for C.
maculatus: 28.56, 49.98, 92.82, 114.24, and
135.66; for T. castaneum: 375, 500, 625, 700, 
750, and 1000; for E. kuehniella: 0.83, 1.49, 
1.99, 2.49, and 3.81). After 24 hours, treated
insects were transferred to untreated vials. 
Four replicates were run for each 
concentration and control. After 3, 6, 9, 12, 
and 24 hours from the beginning of exposure, 
numbers of dead and alive insects were 
counted, and mortality graphs for all doses 
were drawn.
Lethal time (LT50) of mortality
For investigation of the lethal time (LT50) of 
E. cardamomum, the essential oil on three 
pests was used from high concentrations 
obtained from bioassay tests (higher than 
LC75). Selected concentrations (similar
bioassay test selection method) were tested,
and 4 replications were performed for each 
dose. The mortality of subjects was counted 
after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 hours, and
mortality recording then continued at 3–hour
intervals until death of all insects.Journal of Insect Science: Vol. 11 | Article 165 Abbasipour et al.

Oviposition deterrence of the essential oil 
on C. maculatus
For this study, two pairs (2 males and 2 
females) of adults for each concentration and 
control were selected and put in glass vials. 
Each vial, containing 5 g of mung bean grains,
was treated with 1 mL of acetone solution of 
different concentrations of essential oil (35.7, 
49.98, 57.12, and 64.26 mg/mL). After 
evaporation of the acetone (~ 20 min), newly
emerged adults of C. maculatus were 
transferred to vials. Each concentration was
replicated four times. The number of eggs laid
in all treatments was recorded after 48 hour.
Statistical analysis
The lethal concentrations (LC50) and lethal 
time (LT50) values of mortality were assessed 
by Probit analysis using SAS software (SAS
Institute 1997). The data from oviposition 
deterrence were subjected to one–way
ANOVA (p<0.05) after checking for 
normality. Means were compared by Tukey's 
Studentized Range Test, admitting significant 
differences at p<0.05. The SAS software 
was used for all analyses (SAS Institute 
1997).
Results
Fumigant toxicity
Fumigant toxicity of essential oil of E.
cardamomum on adults of C. maculatus, T. 
castaneum, and E. kuehniella after 24 hours is 
shown in Table 1. There was no mortality in 
controls.
According to these values, E. kuehniella was 
more sensitive than coleopteran adult insects. 
Also, T. castaneum was more tolerant 
compared to C. maculatus. LC50 values of 
these essential oils after 48 hours are shown in 
Table 2. After 48 hours LC50 values showed 
that the effect of essential oil was stable and 
the LC50 values after 48 hours were lower 
than those after 24 hours.  Figures 1-3 indicate 
the mortality trend of these insects after 
treatment with essential oil of E.
cardamomum. The highest rate of mortality 
was seen during 12-24 hours in C. maculatus 
and E. kuehniella (Figures 1 and 3), though
the highest mortality in T. castaneum occurred
between 9-12 hours (Figure 2). On the other 
hand, gradient of mortality in higher doses 
was more than low doses. 
Lethal time (LT50) of mortality
With increasing dose, LT50 values of essential 
oil on C. maculatus, T. castaneum, and E. 
kuehniella decreased (Table 3). In these tests, 
E. kuehniella sensitivity was higher than two 
coleopteran insects. Journal of Insect Science: Vol. 11 | Article 165 Abbasipour et al.

Oviposition deterrence 
The effect of essential oil concentrations of E.
cardamomum on the females of C. maculatus
is shown in Table 4. Results showed that the
number of eggs laid by females in 48 hours in 
treatments 57.12 and 64.26 L/mL was 
significantly lower than in the control. On the 
other hand, doses 35.7 and 49.98 L/mL were
not significantly effective (df = 4, 15; F =
5.93; p < 0.01) (Table 4). 
Chemical constituents of E. cardamomum
The results of the chemical analysis are 
presented in Table 5. Sixteen compounds in 
the oil were positively identified. In this study 
1,8-cineol, -terpinyl acetate, terpinene, and 
fenchyl alcohol were found to be the major 
constituents, accounting for 97% of the total
oil.
Discussion
Plant essential oils have potential as products 
for control of stored product pests because 
some of them are selective and have little or 
no harmful effects on non–target organisms 
(Isman 1999). Many essential oils are known 
to possess various bioefficiency effects such 
as ovicidal, repellent, antifeeding, and 
biocidal activities against various arthropod 
pests (Isman 1999; Saxena 1989). For 
example, neem (Azadirachta indica) extract is 
found to have a variety of biological activities
including biocidal activity against nearly 200 
arthropod pests without any adverse effects on 
most non–target organisms (Saxena 1989).
Additionally, some plant extracts or 
phytochemicals are found to be highly 
effective against insecticide–resistant insect
pests (Ahn et al. 1997; Lindquist et al. 1990).
The insecticidal constituents of many plant 
extracts and essential oils against stored
product insects are mainly monoterpenoids 
such as limonene, linalool, terpineol, 
carvacrol, and myrcene (Ahn et al. 1998; 
Coats et al. 1991; Regnault-Roger and 
Hamraoui 1995).
The chemical composition of cardamom 
varies considerably with variety, region, and 
age of the product. The content of volatile oil 
in the seeds is strongly dependent on storage 
conditions, but may be as high as 8%. In the
current study, two compounds (1,8-cineol and 
-terpineol) had the highest concentration in 
the essential oil of E. cardamomum. Similar to 
our results, Olivero-Verbel et al. (2010) stated 
that the main components found in the volatile
oil from E. cardamomum were 1,8-cineol
(29.7%) and -terpineol acetate (26.1%). 
Korikontimath et al. (1999) also showed that 
the two main components were 1,8-cineol
(36.3%) and -terpineol acetate (31.3%), and 
reported that the volatile oil of E.
cardamomum contained about 1.5% -pinene,
0.2% -pinene, 2.8% sabinene, 1.6% myrcene, 
0.2% -phellandrene, 11.6% limonene, 36.3% 
1,8-cineole, 0.7% -terpinene, 0.5% 
terpinolene, 3% linalool, 2.5% linalyl acetate, 
0.9% terpinen 4-01, 2.6% -terpineol, 31.3% 
-terpinyl acetate, 0.3% citronellol, 0.5% 
nerd, 0.5% geraniol, 0.2% methyl eugenol,
and 2.7% trans-nerolidol. In addition, the 
basic cardamom aroma is produced by a 
combination of the major components, 1,8-
cineole and -terpinyl acetate (Lawrence
1979).
Additionally, some plant–derived materials 
are highly effective against insecticide–
resistant insect pests (Arnason et al. 1989). In 
our study, E. cardamomum seed essential oil 
showed good adulticidal activity against C.
maculatus, T. castaneum,a n dE. kuehniella,
confirming its usefulness as a candidate for 
the control of insect pests in stored products. 
Comparing LC50 values of this essential oil Journal of Insect Science: Vol. 11 | Article 165 Abbasipour et al.
Journal of Insect Science | www.insectscience.org 6
after 24 and 48 hours showed that this effect 
was not reversible and LC50 values decreased 
through time (even after 24 hours). Results
showed that moths of E. kuehniella were more 
sensitive than coleopteran adult insects. Also,
T. castaneum was more tolerant compared to 
C. maculatus. Mahmoudvand et al. (2011b) 
stated that essential oil of E. cardamomum
had fumigant toxicity on S. granarious. Their
value of LC50 after 24 hours was 220.76 mL 
L
1 air. Comparing our results and those of 
Mahmoudvand et al. (2011b) suggests that the 
susceptibility of C. maculatus and E.
kuehniella moths is higher than S. granarious.
Huang et al. (2000) found that cardamom oil 
to be a more effective contact poison and 
fumigant against the adults of S. zeamais than 
those of T. castaneum. These findings are 
similar to those of nutmeg oil (Huang et al. 
1997). However, the fumigant toxicity of 
cardamom oil was six and eight times more 
potent than nutmeg oil against the adults of T.
castaneum and S. zeamais, respectively
(Huang et al. 1997).
Comparison of our results with earlier 
investigations (Huang et al. 2000)
demonstrates different responses of the egg 
stage and active stages of stored product
insects to the E. cardamomum essential oil. 
Our study also shows that cardamom oil 
successfully prevented the oviposition of C.
maculatus on mung seeds. Huang et al. (2000)
found that cardamom oil dramatically 
suppressed egg hatching and larval survival of 
T. castaneum, thus showing its ovicidal
properties. In addition, it also prevented eggs 
treated with the oil from developing to the 
adult stage. Hence, the ovicidal effect of 
cardamom oil was probably the major factor 
in the suppression of the development of 
adults from treated eggs. 
For the practical use of the cardamom seed 
essential oil and test compounds as novel 
fumigants to proceed, further research is 
required on the safety issues of these materials 
for human health. Other areas requiring 
attention are its mode of action and
development of formulations to improve 
potency and stability, as well as to reduce 
cost.
In conclusion, results of this study indicate 
that E. cardamomum seed essential oil–
derived materials might be useful for 
managing populations of C. maculatus, T.
castaneum,a n dE. kuehniella in enclosed 
spaces such as storage bins, glasshouses, or 
buildings because of their fumigant action, 
provided that a carrier giving a slow release of 
active material can be selected or developed.
