Two new prenylated quinones, piperogalone (1) and galopiperone (81, and e new prenylated 
dhydroquinone, hydropiperone (91, were ìsolated from Peperomia galioides H.B.K (Piperaceae). 
Hydropiperone exhibited potent antiparasitic activity against three species of Leishmania. 
Previous phytochemical studies of a petroleum ether 
extract of Peperomia galioides H.B.K. (Piperaceae) 
afforded three interesting prenylphenols: grifolin, gri- 
folic acid, and piperoga1in.l In a continuation of our 
investigations on this extract, we have isolated three 
new minor constituents, piperogalone, galopiperone, and 
hydropiperone, to which structures 1,2, and 3 have been 
assigned.

We have previously shown' that the petroleum ether 
extract has a significant in vitro activity on three species 
of Leishmania, responsible for leishmaniasis, and on 
three strains of T?ypanosoma cruzi, the causative factor 
for Chagas' disease. The activities of the major isolated 
co9pounds have been reported already.' One of the 
new compounds, hydropiperone (3), displays a promising 
ac7ivity against promastigote forms of three species of 
Leishmania. 
The petroleum ether extract (7% of dried material) 
was purified by chromatographic methods on Si gel 
(column chromatography and TLC) and resulted in the 
isolation of two new prenylated quinones 1 and 2 
(piperogalone and galopiperone) and the 2,3-dihydro- 
quinone 3 (hydropiperone).

The HREIMS spectrum of 1 shows a molecular ion 
peak at  ml z 342.2183, corresponding to  the molecular 
formula C22H3003. The presence of conjugated carbonyl 
groups is deduced from the IR spectrum (broad absorp- 
tion at 1641 cm-') and is substantiated by two 13C-NMR 
signals at 6 187.3 and 184.9 indicative of a quinone 
moiety? A bathochromic shift, obtained in the Uv 
spectrum after addition of base, indicates the presence 
of a phenolic or  enolic function, also deduced from the 
IR absorption at 3407 cm-l. The 'H-NMR spectrum 
shows the singlet of an aromatic methyl group at  6 2.01 
and two methylene groups resonating at 6 3.12 and 3.22 
as doublets. The quinone nucleus is thus substituted 
by two alkenyl moieties further identified by a COSY 
experiment as a geranyl chain and a prenyl group. 
The homonuclear 'H-'H and heteronuclear 'H-l3C 
correlations clearly indicated the presence of the prenyl 
group, corresponding with the methylene at 6 3.22, the 
ethylenic proton at 6 4.97, and two methyl groups at 6 
1.65 and 1.74 (Table 1). Other signals in the 'H-NMR 
spectrum were attributed to the geranyl moiety, in 
particular the ethylenic protons at 6 5.15 and 5.05 and 
the isolated methylene doublet at 6 3.12 bonded with 
the quinone nucleus. The 13C-NMR chemical shift for 
the (3-10' methyl group indicated the E-geometry about 
the asymmetrically substituted double bond.3 
The respective positions of the four substituents of 
the quinone were then deduced from the long-range 'H- 
13C experiment (HMBC) and NOE (Table 11, which 
further confirmed the attributions of 'H and I3C signals 
of the geranyl and prenyl chains. 
The two alkenyl methylene groups at  6 3.12 and 3.22 
were both 3J  correlated with the C-1 carbonyl group at 
6 187.3, thus indicating the position of the geranyl and 
prenyl chains at C-2 and C-6, respectively. The proton 
signal at  6 3.12 was also 3J correlated with the OH- 
bearing carbon at 6 152.4, indicating a C-3 position for 
the hydroxy group, and subsequently the position of the 
methyl group at  C-5. Further confirmation of this 
position was brought by the observation of 3J correla- 
tions of the methyl protons with C-6 (6 137.2) and with 
the second carbonyl group (6 184.9) located at C-4. The 
structure of the new prenylated quinone, named pip- 
erogalone, is thus ,established as structure 1. The 
spatial proximity between the methyl group and the 
prenyl methylene was further supported by a NOE 
experiment.

Spectra were recorded at 400 MHz (J values are given in Hz). * Spectra were recorded at 50 MHz. The assignments may be

The. second compound isolated from P. galioides, 
named galopiperone (2), is another new quinone as 
shown by the IR absorption at 1668 and 1647 cm-l and 
the two carbonyl signals at B 184.5 and 182.7 in the 13C- 
NMR spectrum. The lH- and 13C-NMR data of 1 and 2 
are very similar (Table 1) and prove the existence of a 
prenyl group at C-6 and a methyl group at C-5, but the 
substituents at C-2 and C-3 are modified. 
The molecular formula (C22H2803) of 2, deduced from 
the HREIMS, suggests an oxidative cyclization between 
the geranyl chain and the C-3 OH group. This assertion 
is confirmed by the disappearance of the conjugated OH 
group in the W and IR spectra, and the presence of an 
oxygen-bearing quaternary carbon at 6 83.4 in the 13C- 
NMR spectrum. The dihydropyrane ring is further 
characterized by the typical coupling constant (J = 10 
Hz) between C-1' and C-2', and 3J correlations in HMBC 
between H-1' and both C-3 and (3-3'. The cyclization 
between the C-3 OH group and the C-3' position of the 
geranyl chain is also proved by the significant downfield 
shift (3-9.3 ppm) of the C-10' methyl group in the I3C- 
NMR spectrum. 
The absence of specific rotation for 2 indicates that 
the oxidative cyclization of 1 inta 2 is not stereoselective 
and suggests that galopiperone (2) could be an artifact. 
This hypothesis is confirmed by the spontaneous con- 
version of piperogalone into galopiperone after a few 
weeks, even at +4 OC. 
Hydropiperone (3) was obtained as a yellow oil, whose 
elemental composition was determined as C22H3203 by 
HREIMS, two mass units more than 1. The IR spec- 
trum shows characteristic absorption bands for H- 
bonded OH (vmax 3389 cm-') and quinonoid CO (1669 
cm-9, confirmed by two 13C-NMR resonances at 6 195.6 
and 198.7.* In comparison with piperogalone (l), the 
lH- and 13C-NMR spectra of 3 (Table 2) exhibited similar 
signals indicative of a E-geranyl chain. The resonances 
of a prenyl moiety are also observed, but the methylene 
group appears as part of an AMX system at 6 2.37 and 
2.24, indicating the absence of free rotation between the 
quinonoid nucleus and the prenyl chain. On the EIMS, 
the base peak at m / z  275 is presumably due to  the loss 
of the prenyl side chain and confirms the presence of 
this group. 
The reduction of one double bond in the quinone 
nucleus, suggested by the IR spectrum, the molecular 
formula, and the downfield shift of the two carbonyl 
groups in the 13C-NMR spectrum, is confirmed by the 
observation of two high-field resonances at  6 47.0 and 
48.0, corresponding to a quaternary carbon and an 
inequivalent methylene group (6 IH 2.65 and 2.751, 
respectively. 
The structure for hydropiperone, therefore, can be 
proposed as 3. The respective positions of the substit- 
uents were determined on the basis of HMBC correla- 
tions, which indicated the position of the geranyl chain 
at C-6, of the OH group at C-5, and of both the methyl 
group and the prenyl chain at (3-3. 
The geminal position of the two latter groups was 
substantiated by NOE enhancements between the meth- 
yl group, the prenyl methylene, and the methylene at 
C-2 (Table 2). The NOE experiments also provided 
some information about the molecular conformation. 
Irradiation of the C-7 methyl group resulted in the 
enhancement of the methylene groups at C-2 (6 2.75 and 
2.65) and C-1" (6 2.37 and 2.241, suggesting the equato- 
rial position of the methyl group. Significant enhance- 
ments were also observed between the C-5" methyl 
group (6 1.56) and the methylene at C-1" (6 2.24 and 
2.371, indicating a cis position of this methyl. 
Hydropiperone was isolated as a racemic mixture, as 
shown by the absence of specific rotation. 
Piperogalone (11, galopiperone (2), and hydropiperone 
(3) belong to the rare class of prenylated quinones or 
dihydroq~inones.~-~ They are probably derived bioge- 
netically from the prenylated diphenols reported earlier 
in the same plant,' by oxidative procedures accompanied 
by the introduction of a prenyl chain at C-5 or C-6 of 
the diphenol precursor. 
Despite the very small amount of compounds avail- 
able, we investigated the antiparasitic activity for two 
of them, according to Mahiou et d1, Hocquemiller et

Experimental Section 
General Experimental Procedures. W spectra 
were recorded on a Philips PU 8700 spectrophotometer 
and IR spectra on a Perkin-Elmer 841 spectrometer. All 
lH- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in CD3COCD3 
(6 ppm) on a Bruker AC 200 P spectrometer operating 
at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, and a Bruker ARX 
400 spectrometer operating a t  400 and 100 MHz, 
respectively. EIMS and CIMS spectra were obtained 
on a Kratos MS-80 spectrometer. 
Plant Material. P. galioides, described by A. Bon- 
pland et al. in 1815,'O was collected by A. Fournet in 
April 1986 along the old road of Chulumani, near the 
village of Unduavi, Yungas, department of La Paz, 
Bolivia (altitude, 3000 m). The botanical identification 
of the species was made by Dr. H. A. Valdebenito, 
Department of Botany, Ohio State University, Colum- 
bus, OH. A voucher apecimen (no. AF  615) is deposited 
in the National Herbarium of Bolivia, La Paz, .and in 
the Ohio State University Herbarium, Columbus, OH. 
Extraction and Isolation. The air-dried P. gulio- 
ìdes (whole plant, 206 g) was extracted in a Sohlet  
apparatus with petroleum ether, CHzClz, and MeOH 
successively, which gave. 14 g, 9 g, and 14 g of crude 
extracts, respectively. Si gel GFw4 was used for TLC. 
The petroleum extract (7% of dried material) was first 
purified by a liquidfliquid partition between 1 M NaOH 
and CHzC12. The aqueous layer was acidified with 1 M 
HCl and further extracted with EtzO. The CHzClz 
extract was submitted to several purifications using 
flash chromatography on Si gel (0.032-0.063 mm) 
affording piperogalone (24 mg), galopiperone (12 mg), 
and hydropiperone (30 mg).
