RESUMO: “Metabólitos secundários isolados de Richardia brasiliensis Gomes (Rubiaceae)”.
A família Rubiaceae compreende cerca de 637 gêneros e aproximadamente 10700 espécies, 
ocorrendo essencialmente nas regiões tropicais do Brasil. Richardia brasiliensis Gomes, 
popularmente conhecida por “poaia branca”, é uma planta nativa da região sul do Brasil, 
utilizada na medicina popular como anti-emética e no tratamento de diabetes. Este trabalho 
reporta o isolamento e identifi cação estrutural de um fl avonóide glicosilado, um triterpeno, uma 
cumarina e dois derivados de ácido benzóico, objetivando contribuir para quimiotaxonomia 
do gênero Richardia. Através deste estudo foi possível isolar e identifi car os metabólitos 
isorametina-3-O-rutinosídeo, ácido oleanólico, a cumarina escopoletina e os ácidos p-hidroxi-
benzóico e m-metoxi-p-hidroxi-benzóico, todos isolados pela primeira vez no gênero, exceto 
o último, apresentando, portanto, relevante importância quimiotaxonômica para o mesmo. As 
estruturas foram identifi cadas com o uso de técnicas espectroscópicas de IV, RMN 1H e 13C uni e 
bidimensionais e comparação com dados da literatura.

ABSTRACT: The family Rubiaceae comprises around 637 genera and approximately 10,700 
species, occurring essentially in tropical regions of Brazil. Richardia brasiliensis Gomes, known 
popularly as “poaia branca”, is native to Brazil south region, used in folk medicine as anti-emetic 
and in the treatment of diabetes. This work reports the isolation and structural identifi cation 
of a fl avonoid glycoside, a triterpene, a coumarin and two benzoic acid derivatives, aiming at 
contributing to the chemotaxonomy of the genus Richardia, through a phytochemical study of 
Richardia brasiliensis. By means of this study the metabolites isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, 
oleanolic acid, the coumarin scopoletin and p-hydroxy-benzoic and m-methoxy-p-hydroxy-
benzoic acids were isolated and identifi ed. All of them, but the latter, were isolated for the fi rst 
time in the genus, thereby presenting relevant chemotaxonomic importance to it. The structures 
were identifi ed using spectroscopic techniques such as IR, one and two-dimensional 1H and 13C
NMR besides comparison with literature data.
Keywords: Rubiaceae, Richardia brasiliensis, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, oleanolic acid, 
scopoletin.
INTRODUCTION
 Since ancient times the world population has 
been using medicinal plants as raw material in the informal 
treatment, healing and prevention of their illnesses. That 
use dates the beginning of the civilization, when man 
took conscience of the need to fi ght against the diseases 
that affl icted the body and has arrived nowadays, being 
often the only effective therapeutic recourse available in 
many communities (Di Stasi, 1996).
Despite its distant history, a great part of the 
world fl ora is unknown because among the 250,000 to 
500,000 plant species existing in nature not more than 
10% were examined under chemical, biological and 
pharmacological aspects (Verpoorte, 1998). Brazil has 
a great diversity on plants that possess non-researched

medicinal potential and are promising sources of 
therapeutic and pharmacological innovations to the 
most diverse areas of human health (Almeida et al., 
2001; Souza et al., 2003; Rocha et al., 2005; Amaral 
et al., 2006; Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006; Barbosa-Filho 
et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2007; Barbosa-Filho et al., 
2008).
 Knowledge increasingly deepened on medicinal 
plants, developed through integrated studies in the fi elds 
of botany, chemistry, pharmacology, and other related 
sciences is vital to give support and greater longevity 
to the use of the fl oristic potential still existing on the 
planet.
 Continuing the research on medicinal plants, the 
species Richardia brasiliensis Gomes (“poaia-branca”) 
was taken as object of study. This species is used in folk 
medicine as anti-emetic and in the treatment of diabetes 
and belongs to the Rubiaceae family which is considered 
one of the biggest families among the Angiosperms, 
comprising around 637 genera and approximately 
10,700 species, occurring essentially in tropical regions 
of Brazil and presenting great importance to food, 
ornamental and pharmaceutical industries (Mongrand 
et al., 2005; Adolpho et al., 2006; Coelho et al., 2006; 
Agra et al., 2007).
Rubiaceae species are known as bioproducers 
of alkaloids, tannins, saponins, steroids, terpenes and 
fl avonoids, besides the report that some species are 
important to traditional medicine (Adolpho et al., 2006; 
Carbonezi et al., 2004; Hamerski et al., 2005; Silva et 
al., 2006; Alam et al., 2008; Cardoso et al., 2008).
Considering the wealth of metabolites of the 
family Rubiaceae, the phytochemical study of species 
that represent the genera of this family, especially of the 
genus Richardia whose chemistry is still little known 
(Tomaz et al., 2008), can lead to the discovery of new 
sources of naturally active substances. This work related 
to the phytochemical study of a specie of the genus 
Richardia shows the latter as a bioproducer of different 
classes of metabolites like terpenes and fl avonoid 
glycoside.
The terpenoids comprise a great family of 
secondary metabolites that are known by their biological 
and physiological functions, and for this reason they 
are used in the pharmaceutical area. Maybe, triterpenes 
constitute the most important group of terpenoids. They 
present a lot of medicinal properties, specially the anti-
infl ammatory, analgesic, cardiovascular and anti-tumor 
effects (Niero and Malheiros, 2007). On the other 
hand, the fl avonoids are part of the group of phenolic 
compounds and are known to possess antioxidant, anti-
ulcer, cardiovascular, among other activities.
 The presence of these classes of compounds in 
the species Richardia brasiliensis shows the potential of 
this genus to be investigated through pharmacognostic 
studies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant material
The plant material of Richardia brasiliensis
Gomes was collected in August 2006, in the city of 
Santa Rita, State of Paraíba, and was identifi ed by Prof. 
Maria de Fátima Agra, from the Setor de Botânica of 
Laboratório de Tecnologia Farmacêutica “Prof. Delby 
Fernandes de Medeiros” (LTF/UFPB). A voucher 
specimen is deposited in the Herbário Prof. Lauro Pires 
Xavier (JPB), from Universidade Federal da Paraíba 
under the code Agra et al. 3195.
Obtaining and partitioning of the extracts
 Dried and powdered plant material (2.280 kg) 
was subjected to exhaustive maceration with ethanol 
(EtOH) 95% in a stainless steel for three consecutive 
days. This process was repeated until the maximum 
extraction of the chemical constituents. The obtained 
ethanol solution was fi ltered and then concentrated in 
rotatory evaporator under average temperature of 50 oC
yielding the crude ethanol extract (CEE) which weighed 
177 g with an yield of 7.76 %. 2 g of this extract were 
separated to preliminary phytochemical evaluation, 25 
g were reserved and the rest (150 g) was solubilized in 
a mixture of MeOH : H2O (3:7 v/v) under mechanical 
agitation for 60 minutes, obtaining a hydroalcoholic 
solution I which was submitted to liquid/liquid partition 
in a separation funnel, under exhaustive manual 
agitation, using the solvents hexane, chloroform and 
ethyl acetate. The obtained solutions were treated with 
anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and submitted to 
fi ltration under reduced pressure. After this process, the 
solvents were evaporated in rotatory evaporator under 
average temperature of 50 oC, yielding the following 
fractions: hexane (23.3 g), chloroform (15 g) and ethyl 
acetate (6.9 g).
Isolation of the chemical constituents
 The ethyl acetate fraction (2 g) was subjected 
to chromatography on a column packed with Sephadex 
LH 20 and eluted with chloroform and methanol (50% : 
50%). 14 fractions were obtained and joined according 
to their Rf’s after being analysed through analytical 
thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The group of 
fractions 12-13 was chromatographed on column with 
Sephadex LH 20, eluted with chloroform and methanol 
(50% : 50%) to give 9 sub-fractions that were joined 
according to their Rf’s after analysis on analytical TLC. 
The fraction 12-13.(2) was subjected to preparative 
TLC using chloroform and ethyl acetate (83% : 17%) 
as eluents, obtaing 3 sub-fractions. The sub-fraction 12-
13.(2).(1) was subjected to successive chromatographic 
purifi cation, resulting on a yellow solid that was coded

as substance 1 (26 mg) and submitted to spectral analysis.
 The fraction 14-16 was purifi ed through preparative 
TLC, using chloroform and ethyl acetate (50% : 50%) as 
eluents, showing itself as amorphous solid which resulted 
in the substance 2 (19 mg), that was subjected to spectral 
analysis.
 An aliquot of 10 g of the chloroform fraction was 
subjected to CC, using 200 g of silica gel 60 (Art. 7734 
MERCK) and eluting with hexane, chloroform and methanol 
pure or in binary mixtures, in increasing degree of polarity 
yielding more than 400 fractions of 100 mL that were 
concentrated in rotatory evaporator and joined by analytical 
TLC according to their Rfs.
 The fractions 284-322, obtained from the column 
with pure chloroform or with chloroform and methanol in 
binary mixtures (0.5% to 2% of methanol), were recrystallized 
with methanol giving a white precipitate, coded as substance 
3 (685 mg) which showed itself as a single spot through 
analytical TLC. It was subjected, then, to spectral analysis.
 The fractions 196-210 were submitted to preparative 
TLC, using hexane and ethyl acetate (70% : 30%) as eluents, 
yielding 5 sub-fractions coded as: (196-210) 1; (196-210) 2; 
(196-210) 3; (196-210) 4; (196-210) 5. The sub-fraction (196-
210) 5, after preparative TLC, using hexane and ethyl acetate 
(75% : 25%) as eluents, resulted in crystals and showed itself as 
a single spot through analytical TLC, being coded as substance 
4 (67 mg) and subjected to spectral analysis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure determination of 1
 The substance coded as 1 showed itself as a yellow 
solid, soluble in methanol, with yield of 0.0011%.
 The spectrum of 1 in the region of IR revealed 
the presence of a strong absorption band in 3404 cm-
1, suggesting the presence of hydroxyl groups in the 
molecule. Absorptions between 1601 and 1429 cm-1
were verifi ed and attributed to C=C of aromatic ring. 
It can be observed a signal characteristic of chelated 
ketone carbonyl in 1655 cm-1, being possible to infer the 
presence of this functional group in the structure of the 
substance in question.
 The 13C NMR spectrum (125 MHz, CD3OD) 
utilizing the techniques Broad Brand and DEPT-135 
revealed the presence of 28 spectral lines. According 
to the observed chemical shifts, it was possible to infer 
that among the twenty-eight carbon atoms, two are 
referable to methyl carbons (GC 57.10 and GC 18.11); 
one is referable to methylene carbon (GC 67.56); fi ve are 
referable to aromatic methyne carbons (GC 100.20; 95.07; 
114.78; 116.13; 123.91); ten to aliphatic oxymethyne 
carbons (GC 105.12; 73.24; 75.66; 72.43; 75.16; 102.08; 
70.18; 72.22; 73.98; 69.86) and the other ten signals 
370

refer to non-hydrogen carbons (GC 158.99; 135.63; 
179.60; 163.15; 166.51; 158.66; 105.75; 123.12; 148.55; 
151.03).
 The signal in GC 179.60 was suggested to be 
absorption of a fl avone carbonyl, corroborating the IR 
spectrum which showed an absorption band to chelated 
carbonyl (155.4 cm-1). The signals in GC 158.66 and GC
135.63 were attributed, after comparison with literature 
(Pizzolatti et al., 2003; Rastrelli et al., 1995), to the 
carbons C-2 and C-3 respectively, fact that strengthened 
the suggestion of 1 being a fl avone.
 The 1H NMR spectrum (500 MHz, CD3OD) 
showed signals in GH 8.03 (d, J=2 Hz), GH 7.60 (dd, J=2 
Hz and 8.5 Hz) and GH 6.91 (d, J=8.5 Hz) that were 
attributed, respectively, to the hydrogens H-2’, H-6’ and 
H-5’. Thus, the presence of a trisubstituted fl avonoid B-
ring could be inferred, characterizing an ABX system 
with substituents in 3’and 4’ in 1. The presence of a 
methoxyl was evidenced by a characteristic signal in GH
3.97 (s, 3H) and corroborated by the 13C NMR spectrum 
which presented a signal in GC 57.10 that is characteristic 
of sterically unimpeded methoxyl of aromatic ring.
 The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets in 
GH 6.21 (1H, d, J=2 Hz) and GH 6.41 (1H, d, J=2 Hz) that 
are referable, respectively, to H-6 and H-8 of a fl avonoid 
A-ring.
 The diglucoside nature of the substance 
was evidenced by the number of oxymethyne signals 
observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The two 
glycoside units were identifi ed as glucose and rhamnose 
based on 1H and 13C NMR spectral data. The doublets 
in GH 5.23 (d, J=7.8 Hz) and GH 4.54 (d, J=1.1 Hz) 
suggested themselves to be two anomeric hydrogens of 
the glucose and rhamnose molecules, respectively. This 
suggestion was strengthened by the 13C RMN spectrum 
which showed absorptions in GC 105.12 attributed to the 
anomeric carbon of the glucose unit and in GC 18.11 and 
GC 102.08, that are referable to the methyl and to the 
anomeric carbon of the rhamnose unit, respectively.
 The characterization and the location of the 
diglucoside unit (rutinoside) in C-3 was based on the 
following observations: a) the chemical shift of C-2 (GC
158.99), revealed by the 13C NMR spectrum, suggested 
the presence of glycoside in C-3; b) the long-distance 
correlation between the glucose anomeric hydrogen H-
1’’ (GH 5.23, d, J=7.8 Hz) and the carbon C-3 (GC 133.53; 
3JCH), observed in the HMBC spectrum, permitted to 
defi ne the bond -O rutinoside; c) the chemical shift 
of the glucose methylene carbon (GC 67.56) permitted 
the location of the rhamnose unit in this carbon atom, 
since the signal of hydroxymethylene group free of a 
glycoside unit appears around GC 62.12 (Pizzolatti et al., 
2003); d) the HMBC spectrum revealed the correlation 
between the rhamnose anomeric hydrogen H-1’’’ (GH
4.54, d, J=1.1) and the glucose methylene carbon C-6’’.
 Through the two-bond correlations (2JCH) of 
H-6 (GH 6.21) with C-7 (GC 166.51) and H-6 (GH 6.21) 
with C-5 (GC 163.15) it was possible to determine that 
C-5 and C-7 sustain hydroxyl. Literature data for C-3’ 
and C-4’ (Rastrelli et al., 1995) were suggested to be 
inverted. The three-bond correlation (3JCH) between 
H-6’ (GH 7.60) and C-4’ (GC 151.03) and the 
2JCH of H-2’ 
(GH 8.03) with C-3’ (GC 148.55) unambiguously defi ned 
those values.
 The observation of the homonuclear correlation 
spectrum NOESY showed the spatial coupling between 
the aromatic hydrogen H-2’ (GH 8.03) and the methoxyl 
hydrogens, thus suggesting that the methoxyl would be 
in the position C-3’, corroborating the HMBC spectrum 
that presented three-bond correlation of the methoxyl 
hydrogens (GH 3.97) with C-3
’ (GC 148.55).
 The analysis of the one and two-dimensional 1H
and 13C NMR data of 1 and the comparison with values 
found in literature (Rastrelli, et al., 1995) permitted 
to identify the substance 1 as the glycoside fl avonoid 
isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, being the fi rst report about 
it in the genus Richardia.
Structure determination of 3
 The substance coded as 3 showed itself as 
a white powder, soluble in chloroform, with yield of 
0.03%.
 The 13C NMR spectrum (50 MHz, CD3OD) 
utilizing the APT technique revealed the presence of 
thirty signals, referable to one carbonyl carbon (įC
183.2), seven non-hydrogen carbons (įC 38.7; įC 39.2; 
įC 37.0; įC 143.5; įC 46.4; įC 30.6; įC 41.5), fi ve methyne 
carbons (įC 55.1; įC 47.5; įC 122.6; įC 79.0; įC 40.9), 
ten methylene carbons (įC 38.3; įC 27.1; įC 18.2; įC
32.6; įC 22.9; įC 27.6; įC 23.3; įC 45.8; įC 33.7; įC 32.4) 
and seven methyl carbons (įC 28.0; įC 15.5; įC 15.2; įC
17.5; įC 25.9; įC 33.0; įC 23.5), suggesting a pentacyclic 
triterpene skeleton to 3.
 The signals to non-hydrogen carbon in įC
143.5 and to methyne carbon in įC 122.6 suggested 
the presence of a double bond in the molecule and the 
signal in įC 79.0 indicated the presence of oxymethyne 
carbon.
 The 1H NRM spectrum (200 MHz, CDCl3) of 
3 showed an envelope of simple signals in the region 
between 1.89 e 0.73 ppm, which are characteristic 
of methyl hydrogens of pentacyclic triterpenes. The 
presence of a large singlet in įH 5.25 (1H) and a double 
doublet in 2.80 (1H) is compatible with the hydrogens 
12 and 18 of the 12¨ oleanane skeleton.
 The analysis of the 1H e 13C NMR spectral data 
of 3 and its comparison with models from literature 
(Mahato and Kundu, 1994; Pauletti et al., 2006) permitted 
to identify the substance 3 as the 3 ȕ-hydroxyolean-12-
en-28-oic, known as oleanolic acid, reported for the fi rst 
time in the genus Richardia.
