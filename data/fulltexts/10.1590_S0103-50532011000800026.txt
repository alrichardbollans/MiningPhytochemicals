Três novos compostos: dois flavonóides [(S)-8-formil-3’,5-diidroxi-7-metoxi-6-metilflavanona 
(1) e 3’-formil-3,4’,6’-triidroxi-2’-metoxi-5’-metilchalcona (2)] e um fenilpropanóide 
[3,4-metilenodioxi-5-metoxi-7,8-diidrocinamato de etila (3)] foram isolados dos ramos secos de 
Piper montealegreanum. As estruturas desses compostos foram estabelecidas através das técnicas 
espectroscópicas UV, IV, EM e RMN (1H e 13C, 1D e 2D), além da interpretação dos dados de 
RMN de 1H e 13C dos derivados metilados dos compostos 1 e 2.
Three new compounds: two flavonoids [(S)-8-formyl-3’,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-6-
methylflavanone (1) and 3’-formyl-3,4’,6’-trihydroxy-2’-methoxy-5’-methylchalcone (2)] and one 
phenylpropanoid [ethyl 3,4-methylenedioxy-5-methoxy-7,8-dihydrocinnamate (3)] were isolated 
from dried branches of Piper montealegreanum. Their structures were established by UV, IR, MS, 
1D and 2D (1H and 13C) NMR spectroscopic techniques, besides interpretation of spectral data 
(1H and 13C NMR) of methylated derivatives of 1 and 2 compounds.
Keywords: Piper montealegreanum, flavanone, chalcone, phenylalcanoid
Introduction
Piper montealegreanum Yuncker (Piperaceae) is a shrub, 
native to the north Brazil1 and has no previous chemical 
studies reported. A continuing search on the chemistry and 
bioactive agents from Brazilian north-northeast Piperaceae 
species have resulted in the isolation of amides,2-5 
aristolactams6,7 and propenylphenols.8-12 In this paper, 
we report the isolation and structure elucidation of (S)-
8-formyl-3’,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavanone 
(1), 3’-formyl-3,4’,6’-trihydroxy-2’-methoxy-5’-
methylchalcone (2), and ethyl 3,4-methylenedioxy-5-
methoxy-7,8-dihydrocinnamate (3) from the branches 
of P. montealegreanum (Figure 1). The structures of the 
compounds were determined by interpretation of the 
spectral data analysis of UV, IR, MS, 1H and 13C NMR, 
including 2D NMR HMQC (heteronuclear multiple 
quantum coherence), HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond 
correlation), and by comparison with those reported in the 
literature.13
Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was obtained as orange-yellow crystals. 
The MS spectrum presented a molecular ion peak at m/z 
327.0887 (M-1)−, in LC-MS-IT-TOF apparatus (ion trap-
time of flight liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). 
The 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of four 
singlets at dH 12.63 (1H), 10.15 (1H), 3.99 (3H) and 2.05 
(3H) consistent with the presence of chelated hydroxyls, 
aldehyde, methoxyl and methyl groups, respectively. The 
presence of three signals at dH, 5.43 (dd,1H, J 10.8 and 
4.6 Hz), 2.97 (dd, 1H, J 17.0 and 10.8 Hz), 2.85 (dd,1H, J 
4.6 and 17.0 Hz), and also signals for four coupled aromatic 
protons at dH, 7.26 (t, 1H, J 8.0 Hz), 6.85 (brd, 1H, J 8.0 
Hz) and 6.93 (m, 2H), suggested a flavanone nucleus14 
with a 3’-monosubstituted B ring, deduced by analysis 
of the multiplicity and coupling constants of the aromatic 
protons.15 The above data and UV spectrum, with lmax at 266 
nm, reinforced a flavanone nature for compound 1.13 Since 
no further aromatic protons were evident, ring A should 
be fully substituted. The presence of the signal to methine 
carbon at dC 193.8 in the 13C NMR APT (attached proton 
test) spectrum was taken as a proof for the presence of an 
aldehyde group, and the low-field hydroxyl hydrogen [dH 
Alves et al. 1611Vol. 22, No. 8, 2011
12.63 (s, 1H)] evidenced the chelated hydroxyl at C-5 with 
the C=O of the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl group.13
In the HMBC spectrum, the presence of cross peaks at 
dH 12.63 with dC 166.3 and 109.3, besides the cross peak 
at dH 2.05 with dC 166.3, 166.1 and 109.3, evidenced the 
existence of a methyl group at C-6 and also suggested the 
attachment position of the methoxyl group at C-7. This was 
confirmed by correlation of the peak at dH 10.15 (aldehyde 
hydrogen) and dH 3.99 (methoxyl hydrogen) with dC 166.1, 
and consequently, the placement of the formyl group at 
C-8 (Figure 2).
The compound 1a (Figure 1), a methylated derivative 
of 1, showed correlations in HMQC spectrum between dH 
3.95 / dC 64.3 and dH 3.82 / δC 55.3. The HMBC spectrum 
displayed correlations between dH 3.95 and 2.14 / dC 164.6 
confirming the methoxyl group at C-5. The presence of 
cross peaks between signals in dH 3.82 / dC 159.9 supported 
the methoxyl group at the C-3’.
Compound 2 was obtained as yellow crystals. The MS 
spectrum gave a molecular ion peak at m/z 327.0870 (M-1)−, 
in LC-MS-IT-TOF apparatus. The 1H NMR spectrum 
indicated signals at dH 7.78 and 7.84 suggesting the 
presence of protons on a a,b-unsaturated ketone moiety.13,16 
The above data and UV absorption bands (lmax) at 317 and 
282 nm suggested a chalcone structure for compound 2.13 
Signals for four coupled aromatic protons: a triplet at dH 
7.33 (1H, J 7.8 Hz), a multiplet at dH 7.28-7.23 (m, 2H) 
and a double double doublet at dH 6.97 (1H, J 7.8, 2.0 and 
1.6 Hz) suggested a 3’-substituted B ring.15 Additionally, 
the 1H NMR spectrum showed tree singlets at dH, 2.01 (3H), 
4.01 (3H) and 10.17 (1H), consistent with the presence 
of methyl, methoxyl and aldehyde groups, respectively, 
besides two hydroxyl group singlets at dH 12.83 and 
14.21. The two low-field hydroxyl protons evidenced a 
formyl group at C-3’. This conclusion is achieved since 
the down-field shift of OH-4’ (dH 12.83) can be explained 
by hydrogen-bonding with the oxygen atom of the formyl 
substituent at a
 
neighboring carbon atom and at the same 
time that the down-field shift of OH-6’ (dH 14.21) is 
caused by chelation between the 6’-hydroxyl proton and 
the carbonyl oxygen of the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl 
group function.13 This intramolecular hydrogen bonding 
corroborated the assignments of the signals at d 7.78 (d, 1H) 
and d 7.84 (d, 1H) to a and b positions, respectively.16 
Spectral analysis of 2a showed Ha and Hb signals with 
a marked difference in chemical shifts [d 7.29 (d, 1H, 
J 16.0 Hz, H-7) and d 6.98 (d, 1H, J 16.0 Hz, H-8)] related 
with the absence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding 
with the C=O of the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl group. The

coupling constant (16.0 Hz) observed in 2a indicated the 
E-isomer for the double bond.16 The placement of the other 
groups in the A-ring was made on the basis of the HMBC 
correlations (Figure 3): dH 14.21 (s, 1H, OH-6’) / dC 169.8 
and 109.0; dH 12.83 (s, 1H, OH-4’) / dC 166.6, 109.2 and 
109.5; dH 2.01 (s, 3H) / dC 109.2; dH 10.17 (s, 1H) / dC 
166.6 and dC 109.5; dH 4.01 / dC 168.5 that evidenced the 
hydroxyl, formyl, methyl and methoxyl groups at C-6’-4’, 
C-3’, C-5’ and C-2’, respectively.
The hydroxyl group in the C-3 was confirmed for 
the methylated derivative of 2 (Figure 1) which showed 
correlation between dH 3.80 / dC 55.3 in the HMQC 
spectrum and dH 3.80 / dC 159.9 (C-3) in the HMBC 
spectrum. Other correlations observed in the HMQC 
spectrum of 2a were dH 3.86 / dC 62.7 and dH 3.75 / dC 61.9. 
In the HMBC spectrum, the signals at dH 3.86 and 3.75 
showed correlations with dC 163.0 and 161.8, respectively, 
providing support for the presence of the methoxyl groups 
at the C-6’ and C-4’ position.
Formyl flavonoids have been reported from a 
few species in the plant kingdom. Early reports 
included a description of 2’,4-dihydroxy-4’-methoxy-5’-
formylchalcone from Psoralea corylifolia (Fabaceae).17 
Its isomeric compound, with methoxy group at the 
2’-position, has been reported from the same species.18 
2’,4’,6’- trihydroxy-3’-formylchalcone has been 
reported from Psidium acutangulum (Myrtaceae)19 and 
its retrochalcone derivative was obtained from Anredera 
scandens (Basellaceae).20 3’-formyl-4’,6’-dihydroxy-
2’-methoxy-5’-methylchalcone and (2S)-8-formyl-5-
hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavanone were isolated 
from Cleistocalyx operculatus (Myrtaceae).13
The compound 3 was obtained as yellow powder. The 
1H spectrum showed two doublets in dH 6.37 (J 1.4 Hz, 
1H) and dH 6.34 (J 1.4 Hz, 1H) typical of meta aromatics 
hydrogens in addition to two singlets in dH 5.91 (2H) 
and 3.86 (3H) typical of methylenedioxy and methoxyl 
groups, respectively. These data suggested the presence 
of tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The signals in dH 4.11 
(q, 2H, J 7.0 Hz) and 1.23 (t, 3H, J 7.0 Hz) supported the 
presence of ethyl group attached to heteroatom and also 
two signals at dH 2.84 (t, 2H, J 7.5 Hz) and 2.55 (t, 2H, 
J 7.5 Hz) typical of methylene hydrogens.
The 13C NMR spectrum of 3 showed 13 signals. 
The signals at dH 2.84, 2.55 and 4.11 are, in the HMBC 
spectrum, correlated with a signal characteristic of 
carbonyl ester at dC 172.8, confirming the assignment of 
the chemical shifts for H-7, H-8 and H-10, respectively, 
and dC 172.8 for C-9 of a dihydrocinnamoyl group. The 
HMBC spectrum also showed correlations between dH 
3.86 / dC 148.8, dH 5.91 / dC 143.5 and 133.5, confirming 
the methoxyl and methylenedioxy groups at C-5 and 
C-3-4, respectively.
Experimental
General procedures
Melting points (mp) were determined on a MQAPF-302 
melting point digital apparatus. UV spectra were recorded 
on a Vankel-50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were 
obtained on an FT-IR-1750 spectrophotometer, Perkin-
Elmer apparatus. The spectra mass were obtained on a 
SHIMADZU LCMS-IT-TOF (225-07100-34) equipped 
with a Z-spray ESI (electrospray) source and operated in 
negative mode.
1H and 13C NMR (1D and 2D) spectra were recorded 
on a Varian Mercury 200 spectrometer in CDCl3 and 
(CD3)2CO, with TMS as internal standard. Sephadex LH-20 
and silica gel 60 (PF254 art. 7749 and art. 7731) were 
purchased from Merck.
The methylated flavonoids were obtained by treatment 
of the sample, dissolved in dry propanone, with 1.1 
equiv. of dimethyl sulphate (Me2SO4) and 1.1 equiv. of 
potassium carbonate (K2CO3) to each free hydroxyl. The 
reactions were carried at room temperature during 12 h. 
After removal of the solvent in vacuum, the residue was 
suspended in H2O (50 mL), treated with 5 mL of ammonia 
and extracted with CHCl3 (3 × 15 mL). The CHCl3 solution 
was dried with Na2SO4, filtrated and concentrated to 
dryness.13
Plant material
Branches of Piper montealegreanum Yuncker was 
collected in Belém (Pará State, Brazil), in December 2002 
and identified in the Botanical Garden, Rio de Janeiro (Rio 
de Janeiro State, Brazil). A voucher specimen (MSP-010) 
was deposited at Emilio Goeldi Museum, Belém.

Extraction and isolation
The powered material of P. montealegreanum (1.3 kg) 
was exhaustively extracted with EtOH (4 × 2.0 L), the 
solvent removed under reducted pressure furnished a green 
residue (115.0 g). The crude extract amount of 13.5 g was 
chromatographed over Sephadex gel LH-20 and eluted 
with methanol (column 1) yielding 43 fractions. Fraction 
17 was further fractionated over Sephadex gel LH-20 
column providing 5 fractions. Fraction 3 after submitted 
to recristalization with a chloroform and methanol mixture 
yielding (S)-8-formyl-3’,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-6-
methyl-flavanone (1) (30 mg).
Fraction 18 (column 1) was chromatographed 
over Sephadex LH-20 and yielded five fractions. 
Fraction 4 gave 3’-formyl-3,4’,6’-trihydroxy-2’-methoxy-
5’-methylchalcone (2) (40 mg), after submitted to 
recristalization with a chloroform and methanol mixture.
Fractions 8-11 (column 1) were also fractionated 
over Sephadex gel yielding 29 fractions. Fraction 8-14, 
after recrystallization with chloroform, gave ethyl 
3,4-methylenedioxy-5-methoxy-7,8-dihydrocinnamate 
(3) (12 mg).
