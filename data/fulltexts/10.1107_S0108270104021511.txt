The two rings are cis-fused. The -lactone ring adopts a slightly twisted half-chairconformation with approximate planarity of the lactone groupand the cyclopentane ring adopts an envelope conformation.The hydroxy group, the hydroxymethyl group and the methylgroup all have  orientations. The absolute con®guration wasdetermined using anomalous dispersion data enhanced by theadventitious inclusion of a chloroform solvent molecule.Hydrogen bonding, crystal packing and ring conformationsare discussed in detail.CommentThe alarming increase in the number of deaths due to tuber-culosis (TB) and growing resistance to existing drugs hascreated an urgent need for the identi®cation of leads for newantimycobacterial drugs. There were 8.3 million new cases oftuberculosis in the year 2000 alone, and this number is on therise. Approximately one death every 15 s is due to TB,resulting in a total of about two million TB deaths annually(Corbett et al., 2003). Strains of TB resistant to existing drugsare found in nearly every country (Cohn et al., 1997), and apercentage of these strains are resistant to multiple drugs,making effective treatment extremely expensive and, in manycases, impossible. Most patients in developing countries, whereTB is an even bigger problem than elsewhere in the world,cannot afford expensive drug treatments. There have been nonew drugs developed for TB in over 30 years. Current TBtherapy relies on drugs that are 50 years old and take six tonine months to complete, making patient compliance verydif®cult (World Health Organization, 2003).As a part of the International Co-operative BiodiversityGroup, our program focuses on the search for novel anti-tubercular principles of plant or microbial origins from thedry-land biodiversity of Latin America. It is in this regard thatthe bioassay-guided chemical investigation of the Chileanplant Valeriana laxi¯ora DC (Valerianaceae) was initiated.The methanol extract of V. laxi¯ora was found to be activeagainst the H37Rv strain (ATCC 27294) of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis, and the bioassay-directed fractionation led to theisolation of the title compound, (I), an iridolactone, aspreviously described (Gu et al., 2004).X-Ray crystallographic analysis of (I) was initiated toestablish unequivocally its chemical structure and to deter-mine the absolute and relative stereochemistries of all thefunctional groups and the ring junction at atoms C5 and C9.The two rings are cis-fused, with both atom H5 and atom H9-oriented, as shown in Fig. 1. The -lactone ring adopts aslightly twisted half-chair conformation and the cyclopentanering adopts an envelope conformation. The hydroxy group atatom C7 and the hydroxymethyl group at atom C8 both have orientations, as does the C4 methyl group.The unusually long bond distance of 1.572 (7) AÊ betweenthe bridge atoms C5 and C9 suggests strain in the fusedsystem. This observation has been made previously for aclosely related iridolactone (Eisenbraun et al., 1981). Asexpected in the case of -lactones, differences in the twoCÐO1 bond distances are observed, the C3ÐO1 bond[1.451 (7) AÊ ] being longer than the C1ÐO1 bond[1.335 (6) AÊ ] (Cheung et al., 1965).The C9ÐC1(O2)ÐO1ÐC3 lactone group is almost planar,with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.0208 AÊ and a maximum deviationof 0.352 (4) AÊ for atom O1.

Hatoms are shown as spheres of arbitrary radii.angle is 177.2 (5), showing only a slight deviation fromplanarity. This con®guration concurs with that reported for(+)-nepetalic acid (Eisenbraun et al., 1981) and an iridane-derived lactone, boonein (Marini-Bettolo et al., 1983).The packing is dominated by hydrogen bonding, whichcreates an in®nite tape of molecules coincident with the 21 axis(Table 1 and Fig. 2). The C7-hydroxy group of each molecule ishydrogen bonded through the O3ÐH3 group to the b-trans-lated neighboring hydroxymethyl atom O4 to form a chain.Each chain faces another chain of molecules related by the 21axis, so that the cyclopentane rings of the ®rst chain are facingthe cyclopentane rings of the next. Each C7-hydroxy group isthen also hydrogen bonded through atom O3 to the H4ÐO4hydroxymethyl group of the molecule facing it, forming amolecular tape. A solvent-accessible channel along each sideof the tape allows for hydrogen bonding to the chloroformsolvent (Fig. 1). Each molecule of chloroform is hydrogenbonded through atom H20 to atom O4 of the hydroxymethylgroup. In addition, each carbonyl O2 atom makes shortcontacts with atom H5 of an adjacent molecule in the sametape, as well as to atom H9 of a molecule in an adjoining tape(see Table 1).The inclusion of a chloroform solvent molecule in thecrystal structure allowed the anomalous dispersion data to beused to arrive at the absolute con®guration of (I) as4R,4aR,6S,7S,7aS. The same absolute con®guration has beendetermined by the Mosher ester procedure (Ohtani et al.,1991), which also unequivocally proves enantiomeric purity(Gu et al., 2004). Although, we are on the edge of full con®-dence in our re®nement of the Flack parameter (Flack &Bernardinelli, 2000), our results are fully consistent withsupporting NMR data from the synthesis of R- and S-MTPA[-methoxy--(tri¯uoromethyl)phenylacetic acid] esters.The crystals were isolated as very thin plates, and crystaldecomposition due to evaporation of solvent at roomtemperature posed considerable problems in the selection andmounting of a suitable crystal. Nevertheless, we were able toobtain important information on the structure, conformationand absolute con®guration of (I) from this study. This infor-mation can now be used to predict the three-dimensionalstructures of closely related iridolactones isolated as naturalproducts but which do not crystallize. To our knowledge, this isthe ®rst report of the absolute con®guration of 1-iridolactonesbased on X-ray data.ExperimentalThe dried and powdered aerial parts and roots of V. laxi¯ora (770 g)were extracted repeatedly with MeOH. This MeOH extract was®ltered, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the resultantextract was partitioned between 90% aqueous MeOH and n-hexane.The 90% aqueous MeOH soluble portion was dried under vacuumand subsequently partitioned between CH2Cl2 and H2O (1:1). TheCH2Cl2 soluble extract was further fractionated by column chroma-tography on a silica-gel column using a step gradient of CHCl3/MeOH. The fraction eluting with 20:1 CHCl3/MeOH (2.2 g) waschromatographed on a silica-gel column using an n-hexane/i-PrOH/MeOH step gradient. The fraction eluting with 18:1:1 n-hexane/i-PrOH/MeOH (370 mg) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column,using MeOH as the mobile phase. The fraction containing (I) (60 mg)was puri®ed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromato-graphy (RP±HPLC) using CH3CN/H2O (1:1). Compound (I) (14 mg)was isolated at RF = 0.62 (Gu et al., 2004). Crystals were obtained asvery thin colorless rectangular plates using CHCl3. Crystals wereremoved in a drop of the mother liquor using a pipette and trans-ferred to a drop of paratone oil to seal in the solvent and preventevaporation. A suitable crystal was selected and transfered to a glass®ber, covered by a thin protective ®lm of paratone, and mountedquickly to prevent solvent loss by evaporation. The paratone oil wasgraciously provided by Professor Marilyn Olmstead of the Universityof California, Davis, USA.Crystal dataC10H16O4CHCl3Mr = 319.60Monoclinic, P21a = 10.523 (3) AÊb = 6.0404 (15) AÊc = 11.231 (3) AÊ = 94.478 (5)V = 711.7 (3) AÊ 3Z = 2Dx = 1.491 Mg mÿ3Mo K radiationCell parameters from 794re¯ections = 2.6±18.8 = 0.65 mmÿ1T = 173 (2) KParallelepiped, colorless0.78  0.09  0.02 mmData collectionBruker SMART CCD area-detectordiffractometer' and ! scansAbsorption correction: multi-scan(SADABS; Sheldrick, 2003)Tmin = 0.268, Tmax = 0.9876446 measured re¯ections2420 independent re¯ections1504 re¯ections with I > 2(I )Rint = 0.088max = 25.0h = ÿ12! 12k = ÿ7! 7l = ÿ13! 1358 standard re¯ectionsfrequency: 1200 minintensity decay: 0.2%organic compoundso774 Smriti Khera et al.  C10H16O4CHCl3 Acta Cryst.

H atomswere easily visible in difference Fourier maps, but all H atoms wereplaced at ideal positions and constrained to ride on the atoms towhich they were bonded (CÐH = 0.98±1.00 AÊ ), except for thehydroxy H atoms, which were constrained to an OÐH distance of0.84 AÊ and a CÐOÐH angle of 109.5. As a result of the fortuitousinclusion of a heavy-atom solvent molecule (CHCl3) in the crystalstructure, we were able to use the anomalous dispersion data to arriveat the absolute con®guration of (I).Data collection: SMART (Bruker, 1997); cell re®nement: SMART;data reduction: SAINT (Bruker, 1997); program(s) used to solvestructure: SHELXS97 (Sheldrick, 1997); program(s) used to re®nestructure: SHELXL97 (Sheldrick, 1997); molecular graphics:SHELXTL (Bruker, 1997); software used to prepare material forpublication: SHELXTL.The structure of the title compound was determined in theMolecular Structure Laboratory of the Department ofChemistry, University of Arizona.
