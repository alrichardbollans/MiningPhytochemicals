hidroxi-N-metil-prolina, e o éster metílico do ácido p-cumárico, foram isolados pela primeira vez das
folhas de L. xuul. Os metabólitos foram identificados usando os dados espectroscópicos obtidos e
pela comparação desses com aqueles encontrados na literatura.
Two new natural flavanones, 5-hydroxy-6,7-(2”,2”-dimethylchromene)flavanone (1) and 5-
methoxy-3-hydroxy-6,7-(2”,2”-dimethylchromene)flavanone (2), were isolated from the root extracts
of L. yucatanensis and L. xuul, respectively. Additionally, four known metabolites, the glycosidic
flavonoids quercetin-3-rhamnoglucoside and kaempferol-3-rhamnoglucoside, together with 4-
hydroxy-N-methyl-proline, and p-coumaric acid methyl ester, were isolated for the first time from
the leaves of L. xuul. The various metabolites were identified on the basis of their spectroscopic data
and by comparison with those reported in the literature.

Introduction
Extensive phytochemical studies on the genus
Lonchocarpus  have led to the identification of
numerous flavonoids, in addition to other metabolites
such as alkaloids, aminoacids, peptides, triterpenes,
sterols, stilbenes and dibenzoylmethane derivatives.1
Recently, we reported a number of flavonoids, several
of them novel, from Lonchocarpus xuul Lundell and
Lonchocarpus yucatanensis Pittier,2,3 two endemic trees
growing in the Yucatan Peninsula, where they are both
used for building construction and for honey
production.4,5 As part of our continuing phytochemical
investigation of these plants, we wish to report the
isolation of additional metabolites from both species.
Results and Discussion
The hexane fraction of the methanol extract of the root of
L. yucatanensis was subjected to successive purifications
using VLC, Sephadex LH-20, and preparative TLC (see
Experimental) to yield metabolite 1 as a pale yellow oil. The
IR spectral data of 1 suggested the presence of an aromatic
ring (1542, 1446 cm-1), as well as a conjugated carbonyl
function (1631 cm-1) and a hydroxyl group (3446 cm-1).
The 1H NMR of 1 showed a low-field signal (δ 12.28),
typical of a hydrogen-bonded phenol proton, together with
an ABX system (δ 5.41, 3.08, 2.83), typical of the axial
1079Additional Flavonoids from Lonchocarpus yucatenensis and L. xuulVol. 16, No. 5, 2005
H-2 and the H-3 protons of a flavanone, a 1H singlet for a
single A-ring proton (δ 5.90), and a multiplet (δ 7.45) due
to the five protons of a monosubstituted B-ring. These
signals, and that of a carbonyl carbon resonance at δ 196.0
in the 13C NMR spectrum of 1, suggested a 5-hydroxylated
flavanone nucleus.6 Additional signals in the 1H NMR
spectrum included two cis-coupled olefinic protons (δ 5.51
and 6.63) and two methyl group singlets (δ 1.45 and 1.46),
typical of a 2,2-dimethylpyran system. Placement of the
2,2-dimethylpyran-ring system at C-6 and C-7 of the
flavanone was rationalized from correlations observed in
the HMBC experiment between the hydroxyl group proton
and C-5, C-4a and C-6, in addition to those between H-4”
and C-5 and C-7 and of H-8 with C-6, C-7, C-8a and C-4a.
On the basis of this data, metabolite 1 was identified as 5-
hydroxy-6,7-(2”,2”-dimethylchromene)flavanone, a
hydroxy chromenoflavanone previously reported as the
DDQ-catalyzed cyclization product of 5,7-dihydroxy-6-
prenyl-flavanone.7 This, however, is the first report of 1
occurring naturally.
Similarly, successive chromatographic purifications of
the methanol extract of the root of L. xuul, resulted in the
isolation of metabolite 2. As in the case of 1, the IR
spectrum of 2 displayed absorption bands for hydroxyl
(3436 cm-1) and conjugated carbonyl (1671 cm-1)
functional groups.
The 1H NMR of 2 was very similar to that of 1, showing
the characteristic five-proton multiplet of a mono-
substituted B-ring and the corresponding signals for a 2,2-
dimethylpyran system. The main difference observed in
the 1H NMR of 2 was the presence of an AB spin system at
δ 5.03 and 4.46 (J = 12.0 Hz) that could be assigned to the
trans diaxial H-2 and H-3 protons of a 3-hydroxyflavanone.
This was confirmed by the presence of a carbonyl carbon
signal at δ 190.4 (C=O) and two oxygenated methine
signals at δ 83.3 (C-2) and δ 72.8 (C-3) in the 13C NMR
spectrum of 2. Furthermore, the presence of a methoxyl
group in the structure of 2 was indicated by the substitution
of the hydrogen-bonded proton signal in the 1H NMR of 1
for a three-proton singlet at δ 3.84, with a corresponding
signal at δ 55.9 in the 13C NMR spectrum of 2. The
placement of the pyran ring in the 6/7 positions was, as in
1, confirmed by correlations observed in the HMBC
experiment; namely, the correlations observed between
the methoxyl-methyl group protons and C-5, together with
those between H-4” and C-5, C-2” and C-7. Similarly, the
location of the hydroxyl group at C-3 was confirmed by
HMBC correlations between H-3 and C-2, C-4 and C-1’
and between H-2 and C-4. This data, and the fact that the
α-orientation of the C-3 phenyl group is usually dominant
in flavanones,8 allowed placement of the C-3 hydroxyl
group in the β-orientation and the identification of 2 as 5-
m e t h o x y - 3 - h y d r o x y - 6 , 7 - ( 2 ” , 2 ” -
dimethylchromene)flavanone, a metabolite which appears
to be a new natural product.
Finally, purification of the methanol extract of the
leaves of L. xuul yielded four known metabolites identified
as quercetin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside, kaempferol-3-O-
rhamnoglucoside, 4-hydroxy-N-methylproline, and p-
coumaric acid methyl ester by comparing their
spectroscopic data (IR, UV, MS, 1H and 13C NMR) to those
reported in the literature. Both flavonol glycosides have
been previously reported from many plant species;9
similarly, 4-hydroxy-N-methylproline has been previously
isolated from Copaifera spp (Leguminosae),10 Melaleuca
lanceolata (Myrtaceae)11 and the red alga Chondria
coerulescens,12 while p-coumaric acid methyl ester has
been reported from long English cucumber leaves.13 This
however, is their first report as metabolites from L. xuul.
Experimental
General
Melting points (uncorrected) were determined on a
Fluka 70/20 series II Holster C70G apparatus. UV spectra
were recorded on a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer
using MeOH or CHCl3 (HPLC grade) as solvent. NMR
spectra (both 1D and 2D) were obtained on an AVANCE
DRX500 Bruker spectrometer, using the residual solvent
peaks as the reference signal. Mass spectral analyses were
determined on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD; using
electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization (APCI) as the ionization techniques. HRFABMS
(+) was obtained on a JEOL JMS-SX102A apparatus.
Vaccum-liquid chromatography (VLC) was carried out
using Merck Si gel 60H, and column chromatography
using Merck Si gel 60 (70-230 mesh) or Sephadex LH-20
(Sigma, size 25-100). Flash chromatography was performed
using Merck Si gel 60 (230-400 mesh) and preparative
TLC was run using glass-coated silica gel F254 (0.20 mm
thick) plates. Analytical TLC was carried out on precoated
aluminum plates using Merck Si gel F254; the plates were
visualized under UV light (λ 254 and 366 nm) and by
spraying with phosphomolybdic acid reagent, followed
by gentle heating.
Plant material
The species investigated were collected in June 1997
from trees growing at the 9 km post of the Yokdzonot-Pisté
highway (L.xuul) and at the 7 km post of the Mérida-Holcá
1080 Borges-Argáez et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
highway (L. yucatanensis), in Yucatan, México. Voucher
specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the Unidad
de Recursos Naturales of Centro de Investigación Científica
de Yucatán (CICY) under the collection numbers 1089 (L.
xuul) and 1103 (L. yucatanensis).
Extraction and isolation
For a detailed description on the amount of plant
material used, as well as on the initial extraction and
fractionation procedures, see Borges-Argáez et al., 2002
and 2000.2,3 The hexane fraction (10 g) of the root
methanolic extract of L. yucatanensis was subjected to an
initial VLC fractionation, eluting with hexane and
hexane:EtOAc (gradient elution), to produce seven
fractions (F1A-F1G). Fraction F1A (816 mg) was further
purified using CC (hexane/EtOAc, 95:5; hexane/CH2Cl2,
90:10) and yielded three fractions (F2A-F2C). Fraction
F2B (22 mg) was then purified by prep-TLC (hexane/
EtOAc, 95:5) to produce 4 mg of metabolite 1.
A similar purification of the hexane fraction (13 g) of
the methanol extract of the root of L. xuul, using VLC
(hexane/acetone gradient elution), afforded 12 fractions
(F3A-F3L). Fraction F3E (152 mg) was subjected to flash
CC (hexane/EtOAc, 85:15) to produce 13 fractions (F4A-
F4M). Succesive purifications, CC (Sephadex LH-20;
100% MeOH) and prep-TLC (hexane/acetone, 8:2), of
fraction F4M (127 mg) yielded 12 mg of the new
metabolite 2.
The methanol extract (2.4 g) of the leaves of L. xuul
was passed through a Sephadex LH-20 column using
methanol as the eluant. One of the fractions (F5B, 161
mg) was further purified using Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3/
MeOH, gradient elution) to produce four new fractions
(F6A-F6D). Purification of fraction F6C (42 mg) by CC
(CH2Cl2/MeOH/H2O, 4.0:0.5:0.1) yielded 9.7 mg of
quercetin-3-rhamnoglucoside, obtained as a yellow
powder; similar CC purification (CHCl3:MeOH, 9:1;
CH2Cl2:MeOH:H2O, 4.0:0.5:0.1) of fraction F6B (43 mg)
led to the isolation of kaempferol-3-rhamnoglucoside
(6 mg), also as a yellow powder.
An additional portion (4.8 g) of the methanolic extract
of the leaves of L. xuul was subjected to VLC
(EtOAc:MeOH, gradient elution) to give three fractions
(F7A-F7C). Fraction F7B (2 g) was purified by flash
chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH, 8:2; CH2Cl2:MeOH, 7:3)
to yield 10.9 mg of colorless needles identified as 4-
hydroxy-N-methylproline.
Finally, VLC purification (hexane:EtOAc, gradient
elution) of the hexane fraction (10 g) from the methanolic
leaf extract of L. xuul afforded nine major fractions (F8A-
F8H). Fraction F8F (738 mg) was passed through a
Sephadex LH-20 column (CHCl3:MeOH, gradient elution)
and further purified by succesive CC (hexane:EtOAc, 8:2)
and prep-TLC (Benzene:acetone, 8:2) to produce 2.8 mg
of pure p-coumaric-methylester as brownish needles.
