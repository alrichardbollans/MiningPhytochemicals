Phytochemical study of Mikania stipulacea yielded lupeol, α-amyrin, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol,
campesterol, β-sitosteryl glucopyranoside, stigmasteryl glucopyranoside, the coumarin
isoscopoletin, and vanillic, cinnamoylgrandifloric and ent-kaurenoic acids, besides two new
diterpene acids: ent-9α-hydroxy-15β-E-cinnamoyloxy-16-kauren-19-oic and ent-9α-hydroxy-15β-
Z-cinnamoyloxy-16-kauren-19-oic. IR, 1H and 13C NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses were
used for the identification of these compounds.

Introduction
The tribe Eupatorieae forms the major part of the
Asteraceae family and comprises nearly 2,400 species1, 2.
Mikania Willd is the only genus in the sub-tribe Mikaniinae
of Eupatorieae. These species are native to Central and South
America, where they are known as “guaco” and used to treat
fever, rheumatism, flu and respiratory tract diseases3, 4. As
might be expected for such a large and diverse genus, its
chemistry is also diverse5. Less than 10% of the more than
430 known Mikania species have been studied.
Sesquiterpene lactones are found in nearly two thirds of these
species5. In the other species whose chemistry has been
investigated, diterpenes, mainly of the ent-kaurene type,
predominate6.
Continuing our work on this genus7, 8 we report herein
the isolation of two new kaurene-type diterpenes from M.
stipulacea. Their structures were proposed on the basis of
spectroscopic data and comparisons of the attributed signals
with previously published data on related compounds.
Experimental
General
The IR spectra were obtained on KBr pellets in a Perkin
Elmer model 1420 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR (300 MHz)
and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
DPX 300 in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard. EIMS
was obtained at 70 eV on HP 5988-A. Optical rotations were
measured with a Polartronic HH8. Prep. TLC was carried out
on Si gel PF-254 (Merck), CC on Si gel 60 (0.063 a 0.200)
(Merck) and VLC on Si gel 60 H (0.005 – 0.045) (Merck).
Plant material
Mikania stipulacea (M. Vahl) Willd was collected in
Restinga de Maricá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, in July, 1996,
and identified by Professor Dr. Janie G. Silva (Instituto de
Biologia da Universidade Federal Fluminense - Rio de
Janeiro). A voucher specimen (SPFR 04123) was deposited
in the herbarium of the Department of Biology, FFCLRP/
USP and was used for the authentication of the species.
Extraction and fractionation
Dried and powdered whole M. stipulacea plants
(1.7 kg) were exhaustively extracted at room temperature with
hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol. Evaporation of the solvents
under reduced pressure furnished 46.0 g, 23.0 g and 225.0 g
respectively, of crude extracts. The bulk of each extract (45.0
g hexane, 22.0 g ethyl acetate, 60.0 g ethanol) was
chromatographed separately over silica gel under vacuum

(VLC) and eluted with hexane, gradually increasing the
polarity with ethyl acetate and then methanol.
From the crude hexane extract, 14 fractions were
collected after VLC.
Fraction 3 was precipited from MeOH, giving 1.0 g of
solid. CC of solid (3A) on silica gel with hexane and
gradually increasing the polarity with ethyl acetate and then
methanol, yielded 22 subfractions: Subfr. 3A.6 yielded 79.0
mg of crystals which were recrystallized from hexane–ethyl
acetate (98:2) and gave a mixture of lupeol and
α-amyrin (69.0 mg); Subfr. 3A.9 (99.0 mg) was also
recrystallized from hexane–ethyl acetate (98:2) to provide
a mixture of β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol
(49.2 mg); Subfr. 3A.12 (43.0 mg) was purified by prep.
TLC (hexane–ethyl acetate 85:15) affording 10.0 mg of
cinnamoylgrandifloric acid. Methanol-soluble fr. 3B (600.0
mg) was purified by CC on silical gel with hexane and
increasing amounts of ethyl acetate and methanol, affording
16 subfractions: ent-16-Kauren-19-oic acid (5.0 mg) and
a mixture of β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol
(3.0 mg) were obtained from subfr. 3B.5 (100.0 mg) after
prep. HPLC (Si-60 column, using Hexane-iso-propyl
alcohol 98:2).
Fraction 4 (2.0 g) was purified by consecutive CCs
(silica gel) to give subfr. 4.10.8 (30.0 mg), which, when
submitted to prep. HPLC (Si-60 column, using Hexane-
iso-propyl alcohol 97:3), yielded a mixture of compounds
1 and 2 (5 mg).
Fraction 5 (1.3 g) was separated by CC (silica gel) into
16 subfractions: Subfr. 5.8 (50.0 mg) eluting with hexane-
ethyl acetate 1:1 after prep. TLC (silica gel) yielded
compound 1 (3.0 mg).
Finally, fraction 10 (500.0 mg) after CC on silica gel
(hexane-ethyl acetate and methanol in mixtures of increasing
polarity) and precipitation in ethyl acetate of subfr. 10.6 led
to the isolation of a mixture of β-sitosteryl glucopyranoside
and stigmasteryl glucopyranoside (4.0 mg).
From the crude ethyl acetate extract, 15 fractions were
collected after VLC.
Fractions 4 and 5 were pooled (3.44 g) and
chromatographed over a silica gel column (CC) eluted with
hexane, gradually increasing the polarity with ethyl acetate
and then methanol. Subfrs. 4/5.12 (100.0 mg) and 4/5.17
(84.0 mg) were submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel), eluting
with hexane-ethyl acetate 1:1, to afford compound 1 (17.0
mg) and isoscopoletin (1.0 mg), respectively.
CC of fraction 6 (500.0 mg) on silica gel (hexane, ethyl
acetate and methanol in a mixture of increasing the polarity)
followed by precipitation (methanol) of subfr. 6.15 (41.0
mg) yielded a vanillic acid (3.0 mg).
Fractions 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 after precipitation in ethyl
acetate yielded a mixture of β-sitosteryl glucopyranoside
and stigmasteryl glucopyranoside (1.3 g).
From the crude ethanol extract, 15 fractions were
collected after VLC.
Fractions 3, 4 and 5 were combined (351.0 mg) and
dissolved in acetonitrile. The soluble part (subfr. 3/4/5-C,
281.0 mg) was submitted to prep. HPLC (Si-60 column,
using hexane-iso-propyl alcohol 97:3), yielding a
compound 1 (2.0 mg).
Frs. 6 and 7 showed similarity on TLC and were pooled
(50.0 mg) and submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel), yielding
isoscopoletin (3.0 mg).

Results and Discussion
Whole M. stipulacea plants were extracted with hexane,
ethyl acetate and ethanol. The chromatographic
fractionation of these extracts yielded stigmasterol,
β-sitosterol and campesterol, cinnamoylgrandifloric9, ent-
kaurenoic acid10, 11, vanillic acid12, isoscopoletin13,
lupeol14, α-amyrin14, β-sitosteryl glucopyranoside and
stigmasteryl glucopyranoside15. The above compounds
were individually identified by spectroscopic analyses and
comparisons with reported data.
The ent-kaurene diterpene 1, obtained as a pure solid
exhibited a 1HNMR spectrum with typical signals of the
ester E-cinnamate, δ  7.69 d and 6.46d (AB system, JAB
16 Hz). The H-15 exhibited an even higher paramagnetic
shift when compared with the H-15 chemical shift of ent-
kaurenoic acid (3) (δ  2.09) and of cinnamoylgrandifloric
acid (4) (δ  5.41), (Table 1). The stereochemistry at C-9
and C-15 was deduced from the chemical shift of H-15
which could be explained only by a deshielding effect of a
β-oriented oxygen function in C-9.

A comparison of the 13C NMR spectral data of 1 and 4
showed that the hydroxyl group at C-9 in 1 produced a
deshielding effect on the signals of C-8, C-10 and C-11 and a
shielding effect on the signals of C-1, C-5, C-7 and C-12 (γ-
gauche effect), thus confirming the position and the
stereochemistry proposed earlier for C-9 (Table 2). In accordance
with this conclusion, the 13C NMR data of 1 were similar to
those for ent-9α-hydroxy-16-kauren-19-oic acid (5). Some
differences were due to the additional O-cinnamoyl group at C-
15, which caused a strong high frequency shift of this carbon. In
addition, direct comparison of 1 with 4 and grandifloric acid
(6), in which the C-9 (without the hydroxyl group) appears
respectively at δ  53.1 and 54.0, confirmed the kaurene skeleton
with an O-cinnamoyl group at C-15 and an OH group at C-9.
The axial trans position of the C-19 carboxyl group in
relation to H-5 was deduced from the chemicals shifts of
C-5, C-18, C-19 and C-2016.
The ent series of compound 1 was established by
measurement of the optical rotation. The structure was
confirmed by MS and IR data.
The diterpene 2 was obtained mixed with compound
1. The presence of the E and Z-cinnamate esters in the
diterpenes was suggested by the observation of their typical
signals, respectively, at δ  7.69 d  and 6.46d  (AB system,
JAB 16 Hz) and δ  6.96 d and 5.96 d (AB system, JAB 12.8
Hz) in their 1HNMR spectrum. 1 and 2 were 2',3' - E/Z -
isomers which could be identified by their different
chemical shifts and couplings.
