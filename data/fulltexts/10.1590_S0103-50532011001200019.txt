O perfil metabólito baseado na aplicação de análises multivariadas (análise de componentes 
principais, PCA) dos dados de espectrometria de massas com ionização electrospray (ESIMS) no 
modo positivo e de ressonância magnética nuclear (RMN) do 1H de extratos brutos de espécies de Piper 
destacou algumas espécies caracterizadas pela produção de lignanas (P. solmsianum, P. truncatum 
e P. cernuum), neolignanas (P. regnellii) e cromenos (P. gaudichaudianum). Análises específicas 
em conjunto de espécies caracterizadas morfologicamente por apresentarem inflorescências 
pêndulas e globosas (P. caldense, P. carniconnectivum, P. bowiei e P. permucronatum) ou  
em espécies que produzem amidas indicaram o potencial mais significativo para tais análises como 
critério para estudos fitoquímicos posteriores. Análises intraespecíficas de plântulas das espécies 
P. solmsianum, P. regnellii e P. gaudichaudianum indicaram uma composição química nas folhas 
baseada na presença dos fenilpropanóides dilapiol e apiol, diferentemente do que produzem 
as plantas adultas. No caso das espécies que produzem amidas, a composição apresentou-se 
relativamente constante independentemente do estágio de desenvolvimento.
The metabolomic profiling based on the application of multivariate analysis (principal 
component analysis, PCA) of positive mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometric 
(ESIMS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of crude extracts highlighted some 
species characterized by lignans (P. solmsianum, P. truncatum and P. cernuum), neolignans 
(P. regnellii) and chromenes (P. gaudichaudianum). A specific analysis focusing on species 
having pendant and globular inflorescences (P. caldense, P. carniconnectivum, P. bowiei and 
P. permucronatum) or amides-producing species indicated higher potential of the methodology in 
determining similarities and establishing priorities for further phytochemical investigation. Such 
intraspecific analysis applied to analyzed seedling leaves of the P. solmsianum, P. regnellii and 
P. gaudichaudianum species revealed the production of dillapiole and apiole instead of lignans, 
neolignans or prenylated benzoic acid, produced by the adult leaves, respectively. In case of 
amides-producing species, a similar profile was observed regardless the developmental stage.

Chemometric Analysis of ESIMS and NMR Data from Piper Species J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2372
Introduction
The knowledge on secondary chemistry of tropical 
plant species is limited to approximately 5-10% of the 
total species described so far. In fact, this limited study 
indicates the potential for finding novel lead compounds 
from tropical biodiversity. Despite the availability of 
high throughput technology platforms to detect bioactive 
compounds, the process of cataloguing their composition 
possesses a significant challenge since it still involves 
largely the isolation and spectroscopic characterization of 
individual components. Additionally, the determination of 
a more complete profile in terms of secondary compounds 
in a given species is not a simple task since it should also 
be considered all organs, tissues, different developmental 
stages and populational analysis of species as potential 
sources of material to be further analyses. To make the 
process even more complex, further variability of chemical 
composition can be caused by stress and/or responses 
resulting from interaction of plants with associated 
flora and fauna or other types of stimuli.1
The metabolome represents the collection of all 
metabolites in a given level of organization of an 
organism, which are the products of cellular processes. 
The metabolomic analysis has become an increasingly 
important approach due to its potential applications in drug 
discovery, functional genomics of plants, food science and 
human nutrition.2-5 In addition, the metabolomic analysis 
at specific times throughout the development of tissues or 
organs can provide information on biosynthetic sites and 
dynamics of the metabolites. Currently, various experimental 
techniques have been routinely applied to metabolomic 
analysis including gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy 
(GCMS), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS), high 
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(HPLCMS), center for environmental mass spectrometry 
(CEMS) or a combination of them.6-12 Since the generated 
data are very large and complex for interpreting, the 
principal component analysis (PCA) has been frequently 
used to analyze all types of matrices because the method 
is capable of extracting relevant information from large 
collection of samples having large number of variables 
which together make the manual analysis virtually 
impossible.13-15
Piperaceae species are very common in the tropics with 
ca. 3000 species among which Peperomia and Piper are 
the most abundant. Some of them, such as P. nigrum L. 
(black pepper) and P. methysticum G. Forst (kava-kava) are 
well-known for their commercial and sociocultural uses. 
Peperomia species are well-known as ornamental plants, 
although several of them are mentioned as medicinal. In 
terms of ecological importance, Piper species have been 
considered as model due to the richness of species and 
diversity of interactions with herbivores.16-21 In general, 
Piperaceae species can be easily propagated and the 
availability of data on taxonomy, molecular phylogeny, 
ecology and chemical composition provides the basis for 
multidisciplinary studies.
Most of the phytochemical investigation has been 
addressed to determine major bioactive secondary 
metabolites and thus, Piperaceae species have shown to 
produce amides, pyrones, chromenes and lignoids.22-28 
Several Piper species are pioneer, and can be found in 
forest borders and for such reason they are also under risk 
of depletion by anthropic activities. Thus, the preservation 
of germplasm is highly desirable but the development of 
methodology for analyzing and recording the chemical 
profile of large number of species is also urgently 
required. So far, the methodology based on GCMS was 
applied to analyze Piperaceae species for determining the 
composition of essential oils29-33 and amides.34 Besides, 
HPLC and LCMS were applied for isolating and identifying 
unsaturated amides.35 Thus, the primary aim of this work 
was to explore the application of ESIMS and NMR 
combined with PCA to analyze crude extracts of Piper 
species in order to determine chemical variability among 
species and also to establish priorities for phytochemical 
investigations.
Results and Discussion
Secondary metabolite profiling
The Piper species for the chemical profiling studies 
have been collected in the past five years in different sites 
(Table 1). The analysis of constituents in crude extracts 
was initially performed on 1H NMR (300 MHz) (Figure S1 
from Supplementary Information, SI) and ESIMS data 
(Schemes 1-3). The analysis of a set of samples by 1H NMR 
considered the region between d 9.0-3.0, excluding the 
intense peaks resulting from the ubiquitous presence of 
fatty material. Initial score plot (PC1 vs. PC2) of 1H NMR 
data revealed a remarkable differentiation of Piper 
solmsianum C. DC. individuals (K-487A-F) as outliers 
of the remaining species, which clustered in the center of 
the score plot (Figure 1). The corresponding loading plot 
(Figure 2) revealed that the major contribution for such 
leverage was due to the high intensity of methoxyl signals 
(d 3.88 and 3.84) resulting from the lignan grandisin (5).36 
In this particular case, the 1H NMR spectrum indicated that 
the crude extracts of K-487D contained almost exclusively

grandisin (Figure 1). Other specimens of P. solmsianum 
(K-487A-C, E-F) differing from K-487D appeared 
together P. truncatum Vell., P. hispidum Sw., P. regnellii 
(Miq.) C. DC. and P. cernuum Vell. The inspection of 
the 1H NMR spectra of the extracts from P. solmsianum 
specimens (K-487A-C, E-F) revealed the presence of the 
phenylpropanoid isoelemicin (3) in addition to grandisin, 
as confirmed by HPLC-ESIMS analysis. Such chemical 
variability within the P. solmsianum species suggested 
more detailed investigation of the 1H NMR data. Thus, 
samples of P. regnellii (with exception of sample D) 
were characterized by the presence dihydrobenzofuran 
neolignans conocarpan (6) and eupomatenoid (7).53 
The set of species including P. richardiaefolium Kunth, 
P. truncatum, P. pseudopothifolium C. DC. and P. cernuum 
belonging to the clade Macrostachys57 is characterized by 
the production of furofuran lignans, such as eudesmin (8a), 
sesamin (8b), dibenzylbutyrolactone hinokinin (9a), 
kusunokinin (9b), arctigenin (9c) and dibenzylbutyrolactols 
derivatives (10a, 10b)42 (Table 1). Nevertheless, only few 
accesses were differentiated out of the major clustering, 
in the PCA score plot, indicating a possible chemical 
variability in this clade and that some similarities of 
signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogens and methoxyl 
groups may have caused grouping with P. solmsianum, 
P. hispidum and P. regnellii. Next, the attempt to get higher 
resolution among species by removal of the outlier group 
of species was hampered by the lack of clustering. In order 
to examine the application of an alternative technique, the 
ESIMS obtained by direct infusion was evaluated to analyze

the extracts from Piper species. All extracts were analyzed 
under the positive mode (see Experimental section). The 
score plot of ESIMS data provided similar results to the 
case of using 1H NMR with differentiation of the same 
outlier group of species. Preliminary conclusions regarding 
the application of metabolome analysis to a large and 
heterogeneous collection of Piper extracts indicated that 
this kind of unsupervised analysis should be restricted to a 
limited group of species or to analyze members of a given 
population.
Thus, based on the initial conclusion above mentioned, 
the methodology was next applied to investigate a specific 
set of samples of different organs belonging to the clade 
Peltrobryon (Table 2), such as P. caldense C. DC. collected 
in different sites (K-484, K-842 and K-951), and also 
P. bowiei Yunck. (K-364), P. permucronatum Yunck. 
(K-310 and K-1022) and P. carniconnectivum C. DC. 
(K-963, K-976, K-978, K-991 and K-989). All these four 
Piper species have in common relatively large and pendant 
fruits. Previous chemical studies carried out on roots and 
leaves of P. caldense revealed an aristolactam58 and a 
prenylated benzoic acid (caldensinic acid 15)41 as major 
compounds, while for P. carniconnectivum, the composition 
of essential oil, a flavonoid and cyclopentenediones were 
reported.59-61 The P. permucronatum species had only its 
essential oil described,62 while P. bowiei has no previous 
phytochemical study. The analysis carried out using ESIMS 
of crude extracts combined with PCA provided better 
differentiation among three groups of samples than using 
the 1H NMR data (Figures 3 and S2 from SI). The P. bowiei 
(K-364), P. permucronatum (K-310 and K-1022) species 
were closely related but distinguished from P. caldense (K-
484, K-842 and K-951), while P. carniconnectivum showed 
some chemical variability in spite of few samples analyzed.

signals far from the center are due to methoxyl groups.
In order to characterize these groups of species, the major 
compounds were isolated and spectroscopically analyzed 
(see Experimental section). Thus, the two samples of P. 
caldense (K-842 and K-951) were consistently characterized 
by the caldensinic acid (15) as previously isolated. Samples 
from P. carniconnectivum (K-991, K-976, K-978 and K-989) 
were more distant from the first species due to the compound

with a quasi-molecular ion at [M + H]+ of 335 (Figure S2), 
whose structure is under investigation. Finally, the P. bowiei 
(K-364) and P. permucronatum (K-310 and K-1022) species 
were characterized by the isomeric flavanones having the 
same quasi-molecular ion at [M + H]+ 287 and corresponded 
to dihydrowogonin (18) and sakuranetin (17a), respectively 
(see Experimental section). The analysis of this set of samples 
by HPLC-UV displayed distinct chromatographic profiles 
(data not shown), and the visualization of some patterns 
using PCA analysis should be expected if retention time is 
used as variable. However, the two species (P. bowiei and 
P. permucronatum) closely clustered in the score plot of 
ESIMS data because of the same molecular ion that is 
provided by the isomeric flavanones.
Next, the application of PCA analysis based on the 
ESIMS data was evaluated to examine the extracts from 
amide-accumulating species including P. tuberculatum L., 
P. peltatum L., P. scutifolium Yunck., P. reticulatum L. and 
P. amalago L. The phylogenetic relationship is supported 
by floral morphology or ITS (internal transcribed spacer) 
sequences57,63 and partially by previous phytochemical data. 
To date, the chemistry of P. amalago is represented by several 
amides including nigrinodine (28)34,39 and terpenes,64-66 
while for a specimen of P. reticulatum from Trinidad and 
Tobago, two aliphatic pyrones and amide dihydrowisanidine 
(23a) were described.57 The score plot (PC1 vs. PC2) of 
ESIMS data characterizes the species according to the 
presence of piplartine (20a) (P. tuberculatum)48 and 
piperovatine (25) (P. scutifolium and P. peltatum)43 
(Figures 4 and S3 from SI). The P. miquelianum C.DC. 
species has no report on chemical composition and studies 
for its detailed composition, being still required. The sample 
of P. amalago contains the amide nigrinodine (28), as 
previously described.61 The pyrones previously described

for P. reticulatum were not detected in an attempt to 
dereplicate the extracts from a specimen collected in Carajás 
City (Pará State, Brazil) using ESIMS data. Nevertheless, 
the analysis of loading plot of ESIMS data indicated the 
fragmentary ions at m/z 165 and 135 instead of those 
accounted for pyrones in the previous analysis. In order to 
characterize the compounds responsible for such ions, part 
of the leaves that were extracted from P. reticulatum was 
fractionated leading to the isolation and characterization of 
the amides dihydrowisanidine (23a) and wisanidine (23b), 
the compounds yielding the two fragmentary ions, 
respectively. In spite of the chemical variability noticed 
for P. reticulatum, such type of comparison should involve 
more detailed and appropriate samplings, not to mention the 
genetic variability studies to account for these differences.
Seedling chemistry in Piper species
In general, the phytochemical investigation has been 
carried out on adult plants, especially in bioprospecting 
studies which often require significant amount of 
material and pure compounds. Comparatively, seedling 
chemistry is essentially unknown and only few reports 
were addressed to determine major compounds such as 
in seedlings of Betula,67 Virola,68 Piper69 and Pilocarpus70 
species. Based on such scarcity of data and considering 
the implication of seedling chemistry in successional 
ecology and restoration process, four Piper species 
(P. regnellii, P. solmsianum, P. gaudichaudianum, 
P. tuberculatum and P. amalago) were examined as 
compared to adult plants. The seedlings were cultivated 
under greenhouse and maintained under the same 
substrate and conditions. Seedling leaves at approximate 
age of 6 months were analyzed by ESIMS in order to 
compare with the adult leaves. The score plot of ESIMS 
data revealed a remarkable difference between leaves from 
adult plants and seedlings of P. solmsianum, P. regnellii and 
P. gaudichaudianum (Figure 5). Further analysis using 
1H NMR and HPLC characterized the phenylpropanoids 
dillapiole (4a) and apiole (4b) as major constituents. 
This profile is quite contrasting with the adult organs of 
respective species, which consistently contain the lignan 
grandisin (4),36 neolignan conocarpan and derivatives 
(6, 7)53 and chromenes (11a-11b),49 respectively. The 
phenylpropanoids dillapiole and apiole are the major 
constituents in essential oil from leaves of P. aduncum L.,71 
but further compounds also include chromenes37,72 and 
chalcones.73 In this specific case, its seedlings also 
contain dillapiole and apiole as major compounds. On 
the other hand, the adults and seedling leaves of amide-
containing P. tuberculatum and P. amalago species were not 
distinguished between different developmental stages and 
their composition were based on amides piplartine (20a)48 and 
nigrinodine (28),61 respectively. The ESIMS analysis of 
seedling extracts of P. reticulatum indicated differences 
among leaves from samples collected at Carajás City, 
cultivated at Instituto de Química (Universidade de São 
Paulo (USP), São Paulo City) and also from P. amalago.

Although the seedlings of P. reticulatum contained the 
amides wisanidine (23b) and dihydrowisanidine (23a). Thus, 
this compound was isolated and fully characterized by the 
interpretation of 2D NMR as the benzonitrile benzoate (29). 
This cyanohydrin was previously isolated from Malania 
oleifera Chun & Lee (Olacaceae)74 and was also described 
as constituent of defensive secretions of various millipedes 
species,75 but as far as we known this is the first report for 
Piperaceae species.
Conclusions
The non-targeted profiling of secondary metabolites 
for Piper species was carried out in order to determine the 
major classes of compounds by means of 1H NMR and 
ESIMS data of crude extracts. The PCA score plot based 
on 1H NMR or ESIMS data showed a distinction of some 
lignoid-containing species including the varieties of 
P. solmsianum, P. truncatum and P. regnellii and also a 
chromene-containing P. hispidum species. The sequential 
removal of these outlier species still allowed some 
differentiation in some extent using 1H NMR data but 
was not enough to provide visible clustering or to clarify 
chemical similarities among the samples. Nevertheless, 
the methodology was proven to be valuable when applied 
to analyze selected set of plant species with specific 
morphological characteristics such as those having 
pendant inflorescences (P. caldense, P. carniconnectivum, 
P. bowiei and P. permucronatum) belonging to the clade 
Peltrobryon or to individuals, varieties, organs or different 
developmental stages as in case of seedlings. Analysis of 
set of samples by HPLC-UV was also proven to be useful 
but when combined with ESIMS provides robustness for 
identification of compounds overcoming the reproducibility 
limitations based solely on retention time.
The overall analysis of a collection of plant species 
has only been possible due to the capacity of handling 
a large number of samples and the corresponding data 
set generated. Nevertheless, even with the use of high 
resolution mass spectrometers or high field NMR 
techniques, the precise determination of structures of 
secondary compounds in an organism remains one of the 
major challenges when a complete characterization of the 
species based on secondary metabolites is concerned.
Experimental
Plant material
Piper species (Table 1) were collected in different 
sites between 2005-2010. The sampling of plant species 
was carried out under the permit from Instituto Florestal 
(SMA No. 40.272/2006), Sisbio/MMA (No. 15780-1) and 
Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos 
Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA, 06/08). The botanical 
classification was carried out by Dra. Elsie Franklin 
Guimarães (Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and the vouchers were deposited 
in this Herbarium (Table 1).
Extract preparations for PCA analysis
For the PCA analysis, dried and powdered leaves 
(2.0 g) of the species were successively extracted with 
MeOH (2 × 10 mL) at room temperature. The extracts 
were filtered and concentrated in vacuum to afford the 
crude MeOH extracts. 
ESIMS analysis for PCA analysis
The ESIMS analyses were performed in a Quattro II 
triple quadrupole equipment (Micromass, Manchester, 
UK). The samples were prepared using the crude extract 
dissolved in MeOH in a concentration of 1 mg mL-1. The 
electrospray positive ionization mode was employed with 
capillary voltage of 4.5 kV, skimmer 50 V and the nitrogen 
gas flows of 250 and 30 L h-1. Samples were directly 
injected to MS using mobile phase flow of 50 mL min-1 
(MeOH:H2O/1:1), data were processed by MassLynx 
(Micromass) version 3.2 (1998). 
1H NMR analysis for PCA analysis
Samples for NMR analysis were prepared using 20 mg 
of MeOH extract, dissolved in 800 µL of CDCl3 (99.8% 
Cambridge Isotopes LaboratoriesTM) containing 0.05% 
of TMS (tetramethylsilane). The 1H NMR spectra were 
performed on a Bruker DPX 300 MHz operating at a 
proton NMR frequency 300.13 MHz and a 5 mm probe. 
Each spectrum consisted of 256 scans and 300 k data 
point, with a pulse width of 8.0 µs (30o) and relaxation 
delay of 2.0 s.
Data analysis
The spectra were automatically Fourier transformed 
with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz by the program MestReC 
(version 4.8.6.0, MestreLab, 1996), and referenced to 
residual hydrogen signal CDCl3 at 7.26 ppm using TMS 
as an internal standard. Spectra signals were integrated in 
regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the 
region d 3.00-9.00. The integrals were obtained for each of 
the 221 regions and regions containing TMS (0 to 0.4 ppm), 
Chemometric Analysis of ESIMS and NMR Data from Piper Species J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2380
residues of chloroform (7.0 to 7.4 ppm) were excluded 
from each spectrum. 
Seedlings
S e e d s  o f  P.  reg n e l l i i ,  P.  s o l m s i a n u m , 
P. gaudichaudianum and P. tuberculatum were collected in 
the greenhouse of Instituto de Química (USP) and germinated 
at 27 ± 2 ºC under 16 h photoperiod (35 mmol m-2 s-1, 85 W 
cool-white fluorescent lamps). Seedlings of approximately 
6 months age had their leaves extracted and analyzed by 
ESIMS. 
Analysis by PCA
The 1H NMR and ESIMS data were exported in ASCII 
format to Microsoft Excel to produce a data matrix of 
sample versus metabolite peak/mass with associated 
peak/mass areas, prior to further principal component 
analysis using the Unscrambler software version 9.5 (CAMO 
Process AS, Norway, 1996-2007). The normalization 
process of the raw data, which consisted of making the 
area under each curve the same for all spectra, was carried 
out to avoid possible lack of reproducibility associated to 
dilution effects and responses of the mass detector.
Isolation general experimental procedures
Silica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) and reversed phase 
silica C18 (Waters, 125 Å, 55-105 mm) were used for column 
chromatographic separation while silica gel 60 PF254 
(Merck) was used for analytical (0.25 mm) and prep-thin 
layer chromatograph (TLC) (1.0 mm). Analytical HPLC 
was performed using a Shimadzu chromatograph model 
SCL-10A with UV-Vis detector (model SPD-M10A) and 
C18 column (250 mm × 5 mm, 5 mm), methanol (B) and 
water (A) were used as mobile phase. Samples of extracts 
were dissolved in MeOH:H2O (90%) at a concentration of 
1 mg mL-1, cleaned up through Sep-pack C18 and submitted 
to HPLC-PDA-ESIMS analysis.
1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300 and 500 MHz and 
13C NMR at 75 and 125 MHz in Bruker DPX-300 and 
DPX-500 spectrometers. CDCl3 and CD3OD (Cambridge 
Isotope) containing 0.05% of TMS as internal standard were 
applied. Chemical shifts are reported in d units (ppm) and 
coupling constants (J) in Hz. HREIMS were obtained on a 
Bruker Daltonics MicroTOF mass spectrometer. LREIMS 
(low resolution electron impact-mass spectrometry) data 
were acquired in a HP 5990/5988A mass spectrometer, and 
GCLREIMS (gas chromatography electron impact-mass 
spectrometry) data were acquired in a Shimadzu GC-17A 
chromatograph interfaced with a MS-QP-5050A mass 
spectrometer.
Extraction  and  isolation of  consti tuents from 
P. richardiaefolium
Dried leaves (68.0 g) were extracted three times for 
24 h with EtOAc yielding 8.0 g of crude extract. The 
extract of leaves was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (20%), 
filtrated on a Celite bed and the filtered solution extracted 
with dichloromethane. The organic fraction was dried 
with anhydrous sodium sulfate and then, the solvents were 
evaporated under vacuum to yield 2.5 g. This fraction was 
subjected to a vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) using 
silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane and EtOAc 
resulting in 19 fractions. Fraction 5 was subjected to prep-
TLC eluted with hexane:EtOAc (20%) yielding sesamin 
(8b)76 and hinokinin (9a).77 Fractions 9-12 yielded kobusin 
(8c, 23 mg),54 kusunokinin (9b, 11 mg)77 and cubebin (10a, 
85 mg).68 Fractions 15-19 were submitted to prep-TLC 
yielding 3’,4’-dimethoxy-3,4-demethylenedioxycubebin 
(10b, 6 mg)76 and arctigenin (9c, 18 mg).78
Extraction and isolation of constituents from P. reticulatum
Dried and powdered leaves of P. reticulatum (100 g) 
were extracted with EtOAc two times, during two days, at 
room temperature. Part of the extract (3 g) was subjected 
to flash silica gel column chromatography eluted with 
n-hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up 
to 100%), to give 11 fractions. Fraction 5 (126 mg) was 
purified by silica gel preparative TLC (hexane-EtOAc, 7:3, 
two elutions) affording cyanobenzyl benzoate (29, 8 mg). 
Fraction 11 (250 mg) was fractionated by VLC reversed 
phase eluted with water and increasing amounts of MeOH 
(up to 100%), yielding 9 fractions. Fraction 1 (33 mg) was 
purified by silica gel preparative TLC (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 
9.5:0.5, two elutions) affording dihydrowisanidine (23a),79 
which was the major compound. 
Extraction and isolation of constituents from P. bowiei and 
P. permucronatum
Dried and powdered leaves of P. bowiei (12 g) and 
P. permucronatum (10 g) were extracted with EtOAc 
(2 × 500 mL) at room temperature. The extracts were 
filtered and concentrated in vacuum to afford the crude 
extracts. The P. bowiei extract (1.65 g) was subjected 
to VLC on silica gel eluted with gradient mixtures of 
n-hexane/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH to afford 14 fractions. 
The fraction 5 (400 mg) was subjected to separation on 
Yamaguchi et al. 2381Vol. 22, No. 12, 2011
Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography eluted with 
MeOH to afford a pure flavanone (18), identified as 
dihydrowogonin (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavanone), 
the EIMS, 1H and 13C NMR data were identical to that 
described.70
The P. permucronatum extract (1.62 g) was subjected 
to VLC on silica gel eluted with gradient mixtures of 
n-hexane/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH to afford 16 fractions. 
The fraction 9 (230 mg) was subjected to separation on 
Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography eluted with 
MeOH to afford a pure flavanone, identified as sakuranetin 
(17a) (5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone), the EIMS, 
1H and 13C NMR data were identical to that described.70
