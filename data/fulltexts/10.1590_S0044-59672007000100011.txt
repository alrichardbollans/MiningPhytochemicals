GENTRY(BIGNONIACEAE) AND HPLC ANALYSIS OF COMMERCIAL PAU D’ARCO AND CERTIFIED T.INCANA BARK INFUSIONSINTRODUCTIONTabebuia incana is an Amazonian tree, popularly known as“ipê amarelo” and “pau d’arco” (Silva et al., 1977; Oliveira et al.,1993). Pau d’arco bark tea is used by the local population forthe treatment of inflammation, malaria, cancer, kidney and liverdisorders (Silva et al., 1977). In previous reports, only thetrunkwood has been studied and prenylnaphthoquinonespredominate among the isolated compounds. Thus,furanonaphthoquinones, such as (-)-1 (Figure 1), thedehydrofuranonaphthoquinones dehydro-5-hydroxy-iso-a-lapachone and dehydro-iso-a-lapachone, together with lapachol,lapachenol, tecomaquinone I, and the lignans cycloolivil andpawlownin are all known components of the trunkwood(Oliveira et al., 1990; Oliveira et al., 1993).In our previously published screenings on the cytotoxicityof Amazonian plant extracts towards the brine shrimp larvaspecies Artemia franciscana, bark water extracts of T. incana werefound to be inactive and methanol extracts showed moderatelethality (Quignard et al., 2003; Quignard et al., 2004). Also,bark methanol extracts were completely inactive to the larvae ofthe insect species Aedes aegypti, the hemorrhagic dengue fevervector (Pohlit et al., 2004). In this report, a mixture offuranonaphthoquinones 1 and 2 was isolated from the bark ofT. incana and these compounds were detected in bark teas usingHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).MATERIAL AND METHODSPHYTOCHEMICAL STUDYT. incana bark was collected from a previously cataloguedindividual at INPA´s Ducke Forest Reserve (Manaus) in January,2001. A voucher specimen is deposited in the INPA Herbariumunder the number 23866 and was identified by A. H. Gentry.Dried, milled bark (1.3 kg) was macerated in ethanol (2 - 7days) and the extract (46.8 g, 3.6 %) was obtained after filtrationand total evaporation. A portion of this extract (44.3 g) wassuspended in methanol-water and partitioned in increasinglypolar solvents, yielding, after total evaporation, to hexane (4.4g), chloroform (11.1 g) and methanol-water (27.2 g) fractions.The chloroform fraction (8.85 g) was chromatographed on acolumn of silica gel 60 (63-210 mm) using a chloroform-methanol gradient as eluent, providing 4 sub-fractions. Sub-fractions 2 (82 mg) and 3 (2.2 g) were separately fractionatedby normal phase preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC,eluents: hexane-ethyl acetate) and by two sequential, normalphase column chromatographic separations, respectively. Sub-fractions obtained from these procedures were combined (53.1mg) based on TLC and submitted to reverse-phase columnchromatography (acetonitrile-acetic acid-water), affording amixture of compounds 1 and 2 (6.5 mg, 0.015 % based onextract).Mixtures of 1 and 2 are known to be unseparable on silicagel. The only known separation was performed by Fujimoto etal. (1991) who synthesized a mixture of (±)-1 and (±)-2 andachieved separation by first derivatizing as the myristoyl diesters,followed by normal phase chromatographic separation, andfinally by saponification. Such separation was beyond the scopeof this work due to, among other reasons, the low yield of the 1+ 2 mixture isolated from T. incana bark.5- AND 8-HYDROXY-2-(1-HYDROXYETHYL)NAPHTHO[2,3-B]FURAN-4,9-DIONES (1 AND 2)This mixture was obtained as a yellow amorphous powderwhich presented the following spectral data: IR (KBr) nmax cm-13424, 3123, 2925, 1673, 1641, 1596, 1534; MS (70 eV) m/z (rel. int.) 258 [M]+• (79), 243 (100), 215 (45), 221 (25), 187(23), 63 (26), 43 (33); 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3, TMS) ä12.18 (s, 1H, 5-OH), 12.03 (s, 1H, 8-OH), 7.75 (m, 2H),7.61 (m, 2H), 7.29 (m, 2H), 6.85 (bs, 1H), 6.84 (bs, 1H),5.05 (q, J = 6.6 Hz, 2H), 1.8 (bs, 2H, 1’-OH), 1.66 (d, J = 6.6Hz, 6H).BIOLOGICAL ASSAYExtract, fractions obtained from partition, chromatographicfractions and the isolated mixture were tested for lethality in thebrine shrimp assay using Artemia franciscana larvae (McLaughlinet al. 1991; Meyer et al., 1982). The dose-response curve wasgenerated by submitting log concentration and lethality data toprobit analysis, from which median lethal concentrations (LC50)Figure 1 - Structures of the furanonaphthoquinones isolated as a mixturefrom Tabebuia incana bark ethanol extract.Figure 2 - HPLC chromatograms of pau d´arco bark teas and 1 + 2sample.1 0 1 VOL. 37(1) 2007: 99 - 102    MORAIS et al.BIOACTIVE DIHYDROXYFURANONAPHTHOQUINONES FROM THE BARK OF Tabebuia incana A.H.

Aspointed out by Wagner et al. (1989), this is the only conspicuousspectroscopic difference between these isomers. Moreover, the1H NMR spectrum presented signals in pairs, with differentintensities, indicating the presence of constitutional isomers. Therelative intensity / integrals of signals suggested the proportionof 1 and 2 to be ca. 2:1. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptionsat 1673 and 1641 cm-1 due to carbonyl stretching characteristicof naphthoquinones, while the mass spectrum presented a [M]+•peak with m/z 258, compatible with the molecular formulaC14H10O5 of 1 and 2. 1H NMR data for 1 and 2 have beenreported (Fujimoto et al., 1991). Our 1H NMR data for the 1 +2 mixture were in general consistent with the previously reporteddata.Mixtures of these two compounds have been isolated fromT. ochracea ssp. neochrysantha (Pérez et al., 1997) and T.avellanedae (Fujimoto et al., 1991) bark and have been shownto possess important activity against rodent and human malariaparasites Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum (Pérez et al., 1997),respectively. Also, compound 1, extracted from dry T. avellanedaebark, is active in vitro against several types of malignant tumorcells and was patented in Japan in 1994 (Derwent, 2006).Furanonaphthoquinone 2, isolated from T. barbata bark, wassignificantly cytotoxic against A-549 human lungadenocarcinoma, MCF-7 human breast carcinoma, and HT-29human colon carcinoma cells (Saizarbitoria et al., 1997).Lethality in the brine shrimp assay has been correlated within vitro antitumor activity in general and this assay is consideredan important pre-screen for biomonitored isolation of cytotoxiccompounds and anticancer drug research (McLaughlin et al.,1991). The ethanol extract and its chloroform fraction showedsignificant lethality (LC50 167 ± 39 and 12 ± 4 mg.ml-1,respectively) towards brine shrimp larvae, however, hexane andwater-methanol fractions were inactive. These results show thatduring partition, cytotoxicity was concentrated solely in theand standard deviation were obtained, according to the methoddescribed by Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949).PREPARATION OF T. incana AND PAU D´ARCO BARK TEA(INFUSION).Medicinal herb sellers at the Adolpho Lisboa MunicipalMarket in Manaus´s downtown provided information on thepreparation (proportion of water to plant material, infusionmethod) of pau d´arco bark tea: milled bark (17 g) was infusedin de-ionized water (100 ºC, 500 ml, 20 min) and after filtrationthe filtrate (tea) was stored in a freezer. Thus, bark teas wereprepared using commercial pau d´arco samples as well as T. incanacollected and identified in our study.HPLC ANALYSIS OF T. incana AND PAU D´ARCO BARK TEAS.HPLC was performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AT LiquidChromatograph (SPD-10A UV-vis Detector, DGU-14ADegasser, FCV-10L Mixer, SCL System Controller, Rheodyne(manual) injector valve, 10 ml sample loop, and Shim-Pack CLC-ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 ìm particle size).Chromatographic analysis was performed under the followingconditions: flow rate: 1.0 ml×min-1, mobile phase: MeOH /H2O 45:55 (0 min), linear gradient to 80:20 (10 min), thenisocratic until end of run (20 min), detection at l = 254 nm. 30min equilibration time was used. T. incana and pau d´arco barkteas, as well as the 1 + 2 mixture, were analyzed and the resultingchromatograms are presented in Figure 2.In an attempt to provide an estimate for the quantity of themixture in T. incana tea, and given that pure 1 and 2 were notobtainable, the T. incana bark tea and the 2:1 mixture of 1 and2 (at concentrations of 1, 2 and 4 mg.l-1) were analyzed intriplicate (Table 1) under the same chromatographic conditionsas used to generate the chromatograms in Figure 2. A calibrationcurve was established from which the approximate concentrationof the 1 + 2 mixture in the bark tea was established using linearregression analysis (Figure 3). It was assumed based on Fujimotoet al. (1991) UV data (which included molar extinctioncoefficients for both 1 and 2) that the molar extinctions at 254nm (detector wavelength) of 1 and 2 differ by an order ofFigure 3 - Linear regression analysis of peak area vs. [mixture 1 + 2]Standard Solution(mg / L)Peak Areas Avg.

GENTRY(BIGNONIACEAE) AND HPLC ANALYSIS OF COMMERCIAL PAU D’ARCO AND CERTIFIED T.INCANA BARK INFUSIONSfraction of intermediate polarity. The isolated mixture of 1 and2 was about as active (LC50 15 ± 10 mg.ml-1) as the chloroformfraction (from which this mixture was isolated) towards brineshrimp consistent with the existence of other cytotoxiccomponents in the chloroform fraction.Despite published studies on more than 20 Tabebuia spp.,furanonaphthoquinone 1 has so far only been reported in T.avellanadae, T. chrysotricha, T. incana, T. ochracea and T. rosea,while 2 has been found in T. barbata, T. cassinoides, T. ochraceaand (given the results presented above) T. incana (Morais, 2003).Under the HPLC conditions developed, pau d´arco barkteas presenting 1 + 2 are readily distinguished from those inwhich these compounds are absent. The HPLC chromatogramof the T. incana bark tea (Figure 2) reveals the 1 + 2 mixturepeak at tR 15.3 min. Given that pau d´arco (palo de arco) isamong the most important Amazonian plants sold in Europeanmarkets, it is conceivable that HPLC analysis using 1 and 2 as(bio)markers may be important for quality control and thedistinction of T. incana from other species which are alsocommercialized using the name pau d´arco, such as T. serratifolia.Also, the presence of antitumor and antimalarial compounds 1and 2 in T. incana bark teas lends support to the traditional useof this plant in the treatment of tumors and malaria.CONCLUSIONThe isolated compounds have potential in quality control asmarker substances for the pau d´arco species T. incana and mayhave use in the detection of adulterated or false plant materials.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors acknowledge the financial support of CNPq/PNOPG (grant numbers 520354/99-0 and 550260/01-3) andthe Bioamazônia/BASA/FEPAD contract, as well as scholarshipsfrom FAPEAM (SKRM) and CNPq (SGS, SMN, ELJQ).LITERATURE CITEDDerwent, 2006.
