Eremanthus seidelii MacLeish & Schumacher tem ocorrência restrita ao cerrado, em torno do
reservatório de Furnas (MG), em habitats que vêm sendo seriamente deteriorados pela ação humana.
A presente investigação fitoquímica mostrou, como metabólitos secundários majoritários das
folhas de E. seidelii, as lactonas sesquiterpênicas (LS) 4β,5-diidro-2’,3’-diidroxi-15-desoxi-
goiazensolídeo (1) e 4β,5-diidro-1’,2’-epoxi-eremantolídeo-C (2); uma metodologia foi
desenvolvida em CLAE para sua análise quantitativa. A análise por CLAE mostrou que não há
variações sazonais significativas nas concentrações de ambas LS. Não foram encontradas diferenças
qualitativas nos perfis de LS nos indivíduos amostrados. Entretanto, há diferenças no perfil
quantitativo entre os indivíduos analisados, apontando para a existência de três quimiotipos
quantitativos desta espécie, com diferenças possivelmente originadas na atividade enzimática das
enzimas que ciclizam uma LS tipo goiazensolídeo (1) em uma LS tipo eremantolídeo (2).
Eremanthus seidelii MacLeish & Schumacher has a restricted occurrence to the Brazilian
“cerrado” surrounding the Furnas (MG) reservoir, in environments that have been seriously
damaged by human activity. The present phytochemical investigation reveals that the
sesquiterpene lactones (SL) 4β,5-dihydro-2’,3’-dihydroxy-15-desoxy-goyazensolide (1) and 4β,5-
dihydro-1’,2’-epoxy-eremantholide-C (2) are the major secondary metabolites in E. seidelii
leaves, and an HPLC method was developed for their quantitative analysis. HPLC analysis
showed no significant seasonal variation in the concentrations of both SL. No qualitative
differences were found in the SL patterns of all individuals sampled. However, there is a different
SL quantitative pattern among the plants analyzed, pointing to the existence of three quantitative
chemotypes of this species, with differences possibly originating from the activity of the enzymes
that cyclize the goyazensolide type SL (1) to a eremantholide type SL (2).

Introduction
The genus Eremanthus Less (Asteraceae: Vernonieae)
comprises 22 species that are restricted to the Brazilian
“cerrado”.1,2 Previous phytochemical investigations with
this genus led to the isolation of flavonoids, triterpenes,
poliacetylenes and revealed sesquiterpene lactones (SL)
as the main secondary metabolites.3-9 Some of the SL
isolated from the Eremanthus genus posses important
biological activities,3,6-8,10 like the antiproliferative effects
on some cancer cell lines11 and the modulation of the
inflammatory process in vitro, by inhibiting the NF-κβ
transcriptor factor.12
Seasonal,13-16 circadian17-19 and populational20-24
variations in the content of almost all classes of secondary
metabolites, including SL,25-29 were reported. The
recognition of variations in secondary metabolite
production can be helpful in chemotaxonomic studies,
1397Quantitative HPLC Analysis of Sesquiterpene LactonesVol. 16, No. 6B, 2005
specially for the determination of qualitative and
quantitative chemical markers that could be applied to
establish chemotypes and as additional taxonomic
characters for the definition of complex taxa.22,30,31 In this
way, SL occurrence has been used as taxonomic support
to determine the limits of the tribes and sub-tribes in
Asteraceae, including the sub-tribe Lychnophorinae, in
which Eremanthus belongs.1,32,33
Eremanthus seidelii MacLeish & Schumacher has a
restricted ocurrence to the “cerrado” surrounding the
Furnas reservoir in southwestern Minas Gerais state, in
microenvironments that have been seriously damaged by
human activity.1,2 Previous phytochemical investigation
of this species afforded SL of goyazensolide and
eremantholide types.9 The lack of studies regarding
possible temporal or intra-specific variations in E. seidelii
secondary metabolism, as well as the lack of studies in
this way with plants from the Brazilian “cerrado”, led us
to develop a method for the quantitative analysis of the
major secondary metabolites of this plant.
Experimental
Chemicals
The solvents employed for isolation of standards were
AR grade, and those used in HPLC and sample
preparation were HPLC grade (Mallinckrodt). HPLC
grade water (18 mΩ) was prepared using a Milli-Q
system (Millipore). Coumarin used as the HPLC internal
standard was from Merck.
Equipment
HPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu LC-6A
apparatus with a UV detector SPD-6AV (set at 280 nm)
coupled with an auto injector (SIL-10ADvp, Shimadzu)
or a Shimadzu LC-6AD apparatus with a Diode Array
Detector (SPD-M10Avp, Shimadzu), coupled with an auto
injector (SIL-10AF, Shimadzu), both using the software
CLASS-VP 6.14. For quantitative analysis, a Spherisorb
ODS-2 column (5 μm, 4.6/250 mm; Sigma-Aldrich)
coupled with a guard-column (Supelguard 2 cm – Supelco)
were used. For preparative HPLC a Shimpack ODS
column (5 μm, 20/250 mm; Shimadzu) was used.
Plant material
Plants from three populations of E. seidelii were
identified by Prof. Dr. João Semir, UNICAMP, where
voucher material were deposited (NPL 223, NPL 226 and
NPL 228; herbarium UEC). Population A: São João Batista
do Glória - MG (NPL 223; S 20° 37.540’, W 046° 19.391’;
altitude 900 m); population B: Furnas - MG (NPL 228; S
20° 42.107’, W 046° 17.336’; altitude 1090 m) and
population C: Furnas - MG (NPL 226; S 20° 38.316’, W
046° 15.318’; altitude 1010 m). Ten plants in each
population were randomly marked for collection.
For 25 months (April/2000 – April/2002), leaves of each
marked plant were collected at 12:00 pm (±30 min) in
intervals of one month for seasonal studies. Every three
months interval, starting on June/2000, plants from
population A were also sampled at 12:00 pm, 4:00 pm, 9:00
pm, 2:00 am and 7:00 am (±15 min) for circadian analysis.
All plant material was dried, as soon as possible, at 40 °C
under forced ventilation for 48 h, and then stored in a freezer.
Isolation and identification of standards
Milled leaves of E. seidelii (1080 g) were exhaustively
extracted with ethanol by maceration. 50.0 g of the crude
extract was suspended in 800 mL of hexane and filtered,
affording 40.0 g of precipitate. 21.6 g of the precipitate
were suspended in 500 mL of H2O and extracted with
n-BuOH (150 mL x 3), yielding 13.6 g of n-BuOH fraction.
A 4.0 g aliquot of the n-BuOH fraction was applied to a
Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma, 400 g) column using MeOH as
eluent to afford 210 fractions (13 mL each). These
fractions were pooled by similarity in thin layer
chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates using n-BuOH/
acetic acid/H2O (60:15:25) as developing solvent and UV
light and cerium sulfate in H2SO4 as detection system,
yielding 14 sub-fractions.
Preparative HPLC analysis (isocratic elution with
MeOH/H2O 9:1; λ = 265 nm; flow 9.5 mL/min) of the
n-BuOH sub-fraction 45-48 (400 mg) afforded the 4β,5-
dihydro-1’,2’-epoxy-eremantholide-C (2, Figure 1). The
n-BuOH sub-fraction 37-40 (756 mg) was submitted to CC
in 40.0 g of polyamide (polyamide CC-6; Macherey-Nagel)
eluted with mixtures of increasing polarity of hexane,
AcOEt and MeOH. The new fractions were pooled as
described above and sub-fraction 13-14 was identified as
4β,5-dihydro-2’,3’-dihydroxy-15-desoxy-goyazensolide (1,
Figure 1). These two SL were identified by comparison of
their 1H and 13C NMR and ESI-MS data with those
previously published.9,34
Sample preparation for chromatographic analysis
Powdered leaves of E. seidelii were weighed (10 mg)
in a glass vial and extracted in an ultra-sonic bath for 10
min with 1.5 mL of a solution of MeOH/H2O (9:1)
1398 Sakamoto et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
containing the internal standard coumarin (50 μg mL-1).
400 μL of the extract was transferred to a centrifuge tube
(1.5 mL), followed by the addition of 600 μL of hexane.
This mixture was stirred in a vortex and then centrifuged
at 1200 g for 10 min. An aliquot of 200 μL was taken
from hydro-alcoholic phase, filtered on a 0.45 μm cellulose
acetate membrane and submitted to HPLC analysis, by
injection of 20 μL.
Analytical HPLC method
Solvents: A = aqueous acetic acid 2% (v/v); B = MeCN
with 2% acetic acid (v/v). Elution profile, 0 to 10 min: 10 to
25% B (linear gradient); 10 to 15 min: 25% B (isocratic); 15
to 20 min: 25 to 45% B (linear gradient); 20 to 25 min: 45%
B (isocratic); 25 to 30 min: 45 to 80% B (linear gradient); 30
to 35 min: 80% B (isocratic); 35 to 40 min: 80 to 10% B
(linear gradient); 40 to 50 min: 10% B (isocratic). Flow rate:
1 mL min-1. UV detection set at 280 nm.
Qualitative and quantitative determination
The identity of the peaks relative to 1, 2 or coumarin was
established by comparison of retention time, UV spectra and
co-injection of reference standards purified as described
above. Furthermore, a relative retention time considering
coumarin as internal reference was determined for each peak.
A quantitative analysis was done by the internal standard
method, plotting calibration curves for 1 and 2 at
concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 μg mL-1 in MeOH/
H2O 9:1. Each determination was carried out in triplicate.
The purity of the standards was confirmed by HPLC analysis
performed under the described chromatographic conditions
and, for purposes of calculation, it was assumed that each
standard was 100% pure.
For quantification of SL in E. seidelii leaves,
chromatographic analyses were performed in duplicate
and the SL content was estimated by a ratio of the two
analysed peak areas averaged to the area of internal
standard. Concentration is shown as percentage of SL in
dry weight of leaves of E. seidelii.
Results and Discussion
This phytochemical investigation of E. seidelii leaves
revealed the SL 4β,5-dihydro-2’,3’-dihydroxy-15-
desoxy-goyazensolide (1) and 4β,5-dihydro-1’,2’-epoxy-
eremantholide-C (2) (Figure 1), both already isolated
from this species and E. goyazensis,9 as its major
secondary metabolites. Together, these SL can be
responsible for up to 7.5% of the weight of the dry leaves
(data from plant 6, population A). This remarkable
predominance, taken together with the SL utility as
chemotaxonomic markers24,26,29,32,33 and biological
activities3,6-8,10-12 led us to develop the present HPLC
method for their quantification.
HPLC method
Analysis carried out in triplicate with three consecutive
extractions of the same material (powdered leaves of E.
seidelii) revealed that 95.2% of 1 and 97.5% of 2 were
extracted in the first one, which led us to use the one step
extraction procedure described. The overall recovery of
the compounds using the method of extraction and
determination described was 97% for 1 and 98% for 2,
and were based on 5 extractions (addition of 4 different
concentrations of 1 and 2 and a control without addition
of SL) done using powdered leaves of E. glomerulatus, a
similar species lacking these two compounds, as matrix.
Calibration curves were made by plotting the ratio of SL
peak areas to the area of coumarin as internal standard versus
concentrations of each SL, and good linearity was obtained
with the standard solutions of 1 and 2 in concentrations
between 1 - 80 μg mL-1. The regression equations for 1 and
2 were, respectively, y=0.6144x + 0.0258 (r=0.9991) and
y=0.8630x + 0.0327 (r=0.9992). The retention times in the
system developed were 26.28 min for 1, 24.87 min for 2 and
23.25 min for the coumarin internal standard (Figure 2).
The HPLC method developed was carefully validated.
For the highest concentration the accuracy for both SL
was 97.7%. The relative standard deviation obtained from
nine analyses performed on different days was 2.05% for
1 and 2.31% for 2, which gives a very high level of
reproducibility. Extracts were also analyzed immediately
and 24h after their acquisition, and no significant
differences were detected in peak areas. The limit of
detection (signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1) was 0.30 and 0.22
μg mL-1 for 1 and 2 respectively. The maximum limit of
quantification for the detector and UV wavelength

employed was 422.0 μg mL-1 for 1 and 449.3 μg mL-1 for
2. Extracts were also done with samples stored for up to
one year to evaluate their stability. No significant alteration
in concentrations were found in samples stored for up to
11 months. The largest difference detected was 1.9% for
leaves stored for one year, which shows good stability
during storage.
Analysis of E. seidelii leaves
No qualitative differences were found in the SL
patterns of all plants sampled. However, significant
differences were found in the quantitative proportions of
the main compounds (SL 1 and 2).
The concentrations of 1 and 2 in leaves of E. seidelii
obtained for each individual in samples collected at the
same time and day (19/March/2001, 12:00 pm ± 30min,
Table 1) led us to group the studied individuals in three
clusters with different ratios of compounds 1 and 2.
HPLC analysis carried out with plants selected to
represent each of these three clusters, showed no significant
seasonal variation in the concentration of 1 and 2 in none
of them over the two years sampled (Figure 3). Individuals
analyzed for seasonal variation were: 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 from
population A; 1, 3 and 7 from population B; and 1, 3 and 7
from population C. Furthermore, SL concentration in leaves
of E. seidelii showed no significant correlation with the
plant stem diameter or height, which were proposed as
variables indicatives of the age of the plants. It is well known
that in some tribes of Asteraceae, including Vernonieae and
Heliantheae amongst others, SL are predominantly (if not

exclusively) produced in glandular trichomes, which
biosynthetic capacity is finished before leaves are
expanded.35 Thus, no circadian variation could be expected
for these metabolites. Since the major secondary metabolites
found in E. seidelii are SL, no analyses were carried out
with samples collected previously for circadian studies.
Thus, any influence of environmental or developmental
factors on the contents of 1 and 2 were excluded by the
facts that neighboring trees can belong to different clusters,
and that there are no seasonal variations in SL
concentrations. Additionally, 1 (a goyazensolide type SL)
is a biosynthetic precursor for 2 (a eremantholide type
SL),3 which reveals genetic conditions to produce both
SL in the plants studied. Therefore, the difference possibly
remains in a differential activity of the enzymes that
cyclisation 1 to 2. These significant differences in the
levels of biosynthetically related SL, taken together with
the valuable property of SL as chemotaxonomic
markers24,26,29,32,33 and the fact that 1 and 2 are the main
constituents from the secondary chemistry in leaves of E.
seidelii, lead us to propose the following quantitative
chemotypes: (i) plants in this cluster are the only ones
that present 2 in higher concentrations than 1. In fact,
individuals in this cluster present the highest concen-
trations of 2 (more than 2.7% of the dried leaf weight in
the plants studied) and the lowest concentrations of 1
(below 1.7% in the plants studied). Individuals 2 and 4
from population A, which corresponds to 6.7% of the
plants studied, represent this chemotype, denominated
high E for its high relative contents of the Eremantholide
type SL 2; (ii) in the other extreme are grouped individuals
with very low relative contents of 2, showing a ratio
between 1 and 2 above 10. Individuals in this cluster show
intermediate concentrations of 1 (between 1.9 and 3.3%
in the plants studied) and the lowest concentrations of 2
(below 0.2% in the plants studied). Plants 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and
9 from population B and plants 6, 7 and 8 from population
C (in total 30.0% of the plants analyzed) are representative
of this chemotype denominated low E, for its low relative
contents of the Eremantholide type SL 2; (iii) this last
cluster is the largest one comprising plants that present
an intermediate ratio of compounds 1 and 2 (between 1.5
and 10). The plants not included in the clusters above
(which represents 63.3% of the individuals analyzed) form
this chemotype denominated medium GE, due to the
intermediate contents of both SL.
Similarly, quantitative chemotypes based on relative
concentrations of biosynthetically related SL were, for
example, established for Artemisia annua29 and Artemisia
herba-alba.22
