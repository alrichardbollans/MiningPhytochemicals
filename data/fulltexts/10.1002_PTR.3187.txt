Abstract 
The antiproliferative effects of n-hexane, chloroform and aqueous methanol extracts 
prepared from the whole plant of Centaurea arenaria M.B. ex Willd. were investigated 
against cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) and skin 
epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells, using the MTT assay. The chloroform extract 
displayed high tumour cell proliferation inhibitory activity (higher than 85% at 10 
µg/ml concentration), and was therefore subjected to a bioassay-guided multistep 
separation procedure. Flavonoids (eupatilin, eupatorin, 3’-methyleupatorin, apigenin 
and isokaempferid), lignans (arctigenin, arctiin and matairesinol), the sesquiterpene 
cnicin, serotonin conjugates (moschamine and cis-moschamine), β-amyrin and β-
sitosterin-β-D-glycopyranoside, identified by means of UV, MS and NMR 
spectroscopy, were obtained for the first time from this species. The isolated 
compounds were also evaluated for their tumour cell growth inhibitory activites on 
HeLa, MCF7 and A431 cells, and different types of secondary metabolites were found 
to be responsible for the antitumour effects of the extracts; in addition to moderately 
active compounds (isokaempferid and moschamine), especially apigenin, eupatorin, 
arctigenin, arctiin, matairesinol and cnicin exert marked antitumour effects against these 
cell lines.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Due to the ever-increasing number of tumourous diseases, there is a great need 
worldwide to develop new drugs with antitumour activity, either by synthetizing new 
molecules or through isolation from plants. Since the majority of drugs used in 
anticancer therapy are isolated from plants, or are modifications of natural molecules, or 
designed on templates of natural origin, it is crucial to maintain the search for plants 
with antitumour activity (Cragg et al., 2009). 
As part of our ongoing research into antiproliferative compounds from 
Hungarian species of Asteraceae family, extracts of several Centaurea species (C. 
biebersteini, C. jacea and C. spinulosa) native to Middle and Eastern Europe were 
earlier tested against human tumour cell lines (Csupor-Löffler et al., 2009). High cell 
proliferation inhibitory activity was recorded for many extracts, which drew our 
attention to the investigation of other, not well-known species of the Centaurea genus. 
The aim of the present study was an investigation of the antiproliferative effects of 
active compounds in C. arenaria M.B. ex Willd. 
 The genus Centaurea from the tribe Cynereae comprises about 500 species, and 
has been the object of numerous chemical studies, leading to the isolation of acetylenes, 
sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids and lignans as the main characteristic secondary 
metabolites (Hegnauer 1989). C. arenaria M.B. ex Willd. is a 30-120 cm high biennial 
or perennial herb, mostly found on sandy ground, indigenous to Middle-eastern and 
South-eastern Europe. Previous investigations revealed the toxicity of the methanol 
extract of C. arenaria in the brine shrimp lethality test (Janackovic et al., 2008), but 
without the identification of any compound. With the aim of determining the potency of

the plant extracts against human tumour cells, the n-hexane, chloroform and aqueous 
MeOH extracts were assayed in vitro on cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma (HeLa), 
breast epithelial adenocarcinoma (MCF7) and skin epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cell 
lines. The most active CHCl3 extract was subjected to detailed phytochemical study 
with guidance of antiproliferative assays. The flavonoids eupatilin (1), eupatorin (2) and 
apigenin (4), the sesquiterpene cnicin (6), and the lignans arctigenin (7), arctiin (8) and 
matairesinol (9) were obtained as antitumour constituents of the active fractions. The 
preparative work also resulted in the isolation of 3’-methyleupatorin (3), isokaempferid 
(5), moschamine (11), cis-moschamine (12), β-amyrin (13) and β-sitosterin-β-D-
glycopyranoside (14), which proved to be inactive or exerted only a limited effects 
against the tested tumour cells.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
General. Melting points are uncorrected. Optical rotation was determined with a 
Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH on a Shimadzu UV-
2101 PC UV-VIS spectrophotometer. NMR spectra on solutions in CDCl3 were 
recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz (1H) or 125 MHz 
(13C); the signals of the deuterated solvent were taken as reference (7.26 ppm in 1H-
NMR, and 77.0 ppm in 13C-NMR). Two-dimensional (2D) experiments (1H,1H-COSY, 
HSQC, HMBC and NOESY) were set up, performed and processed with the standard 
Bruker protocol. Silica gel plates were applied for analytical and preparative TLC 
(Merck 5717 and 5715). ESIMS was performed on an Applied Biosystems 3200 QTrap 
instrument in ion trap mode. For vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC), SiO2 (Silica

was performed with a Chromatotron instrument (Model 8924, Harrison Research) on 
manually prepared SiO2 (Silica gel 60GF254, Merck 7730) plates of 2 and 4 mm 
thickness, at a flow rate of 4 and 10 ml/min, respectively. Preparative layer 
chromatography (PLC) was carried out on SiO2 plates (20×20 cm Silica gel 60F254, 
Merck 5715). Separation was monitored in UV light at 254 nm. HPLC was carried out 
on a Waters instrument on a LiChrospher RP-18 (5 µm, 250 x 4 mm, Merck) column.  
 
Plant material. C. arenaria was gathered in August 2006 in Budapest-Rákosrendezı, 
Hungary, and was identified by Dr. Tamás Rédei (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 
Institute of Ecology and Botany, Vácrátót, Hungary). A voucher specimen (No. 761) 
has been deposited at the Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged. 
 
Extraction and isolation. Extracts for the preliminary assay were prepared from 10 g 
air-dried, ground plant material with 3x100 ml MeOH, using an ultrasonic bed. After 
filtration and evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 50 ml 50% aqueous MeOH, and 
subjected to solvent-solvent partition between n-hexane (3x50 ml) and CHCl3 (3x50 
ml), affording extracts with the yields presented in Table 1.  
Dried and ground C. arenaria (3 kg) was extracted with 5 1 MeOH for the 
isolation of the pure compounds. The concentrated extract was dissolved in 2 l 50% 
aqueous MeOH, and extracted first with 3×2 l n-hexane, and then with 3×2 l CHCl3. 
After evaporation, the CHCl3 phase (33.13 g) was fractionated by CC on silica gel, 
using a gradient system of cyclohexane/EtOAc/MeOH [1:0:0 (600 ml), 95:5:0 (5400 
ml), 9:1:0 (16800 ml), 85:15:0 (6300 ml), 75:25 (6600 ml), 6:4:0 (2700 ml), 5:5:0 (6000

ml), 0:1:4 (45000 ml) and 0:0:1 (10200 ml)]. Fractions with similar compositions 
according to TLC monitoring were combined, affording fractions F1-F36, which were 
tested for their antiproliferative effects. From the marginally active fraction F6, eluted 
with cyclohexane/EtOAc 9:1, β-amyrin (13) (7.0 mg) was crystallized. Crystallization 
of fractions F21 and F22, which were eluted with cyclohexane/EtOAc 75:25, resulted in 
the isolation of apigenin (2) (36.2 mg) and 3’-methyleupatorin (3) (48.5 mg). In the 
bioassay, F21 exhibited a pronounced growth inhibitory effect (67.9%) against HeLa 
cells.  
Fractions F25, F26 (eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 3:2) and F28 (eluted with n-
hexane/EtOAc 1:1) were found to exert marked antiproliferative activity, and were 
analysed in detail. All of these fractions were separated by OCC on polyamide, using a 
gradient system of MeOH/H2O (1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1, 1:0). The material obtained from the 
chromatography of F25 [cell proliferation inhibition 37.6% (A431), 4.0% (MCF7) and 
55.7% (HeLa)] with MeOH/H2O 3:2 was further fractionated by preparative TLC on 
silica gel, using a mobile phase of CHCl3/MeOH 24:1, which led to the isolation of 
isokaempferid (5) (15.2 mg).  
 Fractions F26/3 and F26/4, obtained by polyamide CC of F26 [cell proliferation 
inhibition 61.5% (A431), 41.3% (MCF7) and 76.2% (HeLa)] with MeOH/H2O 1:4 and 
2:3, respectively, were purified by preparative TLC, using n-hexane/CHCl3/MeOH 
5:4:2 as developing system on silica gel, resulting in the isolation of arctigenin (7) (69.5 
mg) and, after preparative TLC purification (silica gel, cyclohexane/CHCl3/MeOH 
5:4:2), matairesinol (9) (31.3 mg). From fraction F26/5, eluted with MeOH/H2O 3:2, 
pure eupatilin (1) was crystallized (8.1 mg).

The subfraction obtained from the active fraction F28 [cell proliferation 
inhibition 76.4% (A431), 44.8% (MCF7) and 42.0% (HeLa)] with MeOH/H2O 3:2 was 
chromatographed by preparative TLC with the solvent system CHCl3/MeOH 49:1, 
resulting in the isolation of eupatorin (4) (30.1 mg). 
 Fraction F30, which was eluted with cyclohexane/EtOAc/MeOH 10:10:1, and 
which exerted cell proliferation inhibition of 33.2% on A431, 34.5% on MCF7 and 
26.5% on HeLa cells,  was separated by VLC on silica gel with a gradient system of 
CHCl3/MeOH into 8 subfractions. Subfraction 2, obtained with CHCl3 and 
CHCl3/MeOH 99:1, was purified on RP-TLC with MeOH/H2O 7:3 as eluent, yielding 
(±)-syringaresinol (10) (2.3 mg). 
 Analogous VLC of fraction F31 [cell proliferation inhibition of 23.8% (A431), 
35.8% (MCF7) and 21.7% (HeLa)] yielded 10 subfractions, of which subfraction 6 was 
separated by CPC with a gradient system of n-hexane/acetone 3:2, 5:5 and 2:3, to give 
cnicin (6) (16.4 mg) and a subfraction, which, after preparative TLC (silica gel, solvent 
system: CH2Cl2/MeOH 95:5), afforded a mixture of isomeric compounds. This mixture 
was separated by RP-HPLC, using the mobile phase MeOH/H2O 9:11, to yield 
moschamine (11) (17.9 mg) and cis-moschamine (12) (4.5 mg). Furthermore, 
crystallization of fraction F31 before VLC chromatography resulted in the isolation of 
β-sitosterin-β-D-glucopyranoside (14) (12.8 mg).  
Fraction F33, eluted with cyclohexane/EtOAc/MeOH 5:5:1, exhibited good 
activity against HeLa cells [cell proliferation inhibition 64.3% (HeLa), 16.8% (A431) 
and 26.2% (MCF7)]. It was submitted to CPC, using a gradient system of 
cyclohexane/EtOAc/MeOH; the subfraction eluted with cyclohexane/EtOAc/MeOH

Antiproliferative assays. Antiproliferative effects were measured in vitro on three 
human cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7 and A431) with the MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]) assay (Mosmann, 1983). Briefly, a limited 
number of human cancer cells (5000/well) were seeded onto a 96-well microplate and 
became attached to the bottom of the well overnight. On the second day of the 
procedure, the original medium was removed and 200 µl new medium containing the 
test substances was added. After an incubation period of 72 hours, the living cells were 
assayed by the addition of 20 µl 5 mg/ml MTT solution. MTT was converted by intact 
mitochondrial reductase and precipitated as blue formazan crystals during a 4-hour 
contact period. The medium was then removed and the precipitated crystals were 
dissolved in 100 µl DMSO during a 60-minute period of shaking. Finally, the reduced 
MTT was assayed at 545 nm using a microplate reader, wells with untreated cells being 
taken as control. All in vitro experiments were carried out on two microplates with at 
least 5 parallel wells. Doxorubicin and cisplatin were used as positive controls. Stock 
solutions of 10 mg/ml of the tested compounds and extracts were prepared with DMSO. 
The highest DMSO concentration (0.3%) of the medium did not have any significant 
effect on cell proliferation. The dose-response curves of the compounds were fitted by 
means of the computer program GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, 
CA, USA), and IC50 values (the concentration at which the cell proliferation is 50% of 
the untreated control) were calculated.

In a preliminary study, the antiproliferative effects of the extracts prepared from the 
whole plant of C. arenaria were evaluated on the HeLa, A431 and MCF7 cell lines, 
using the MTT assay. The dried plant material was extracted with MeOH, and this 
extract was subjected to solvent–solvent partitioning, yielding n-hexane-, CHCl3- and 
aqueous MeOH-soluble phases. The CHCl3 extract exerted substantial tumour cell 
growth inhibitory activity at 10 µg/ml concentration against all three cell lines (Table 
1), and accordingly it was selected for a detailed phytochemical-pharmacological 
analysis in order to identify the antiproliferative constituents.  
In the preparative experiment, C. arenaria was extracted by the same method, 
and the effective CHCl3 extract was subjected to OCC using gradient elution. Fourteen 
compounds (1-14) were isolated from the highly and moderate active fractions through 
the use of VLC, CPC, preparative TLC and HPLC techniques. The compounds were 
identified by means of UV, ESIMS and NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMR and JMOD) and 
comparison of the spectral data with literature values. For compounds 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8, 
2D NMR measurements (1H-1H COSY, NOESY, HSQC and HMBC) were also carried 
out, which allowed complete 1H- and 13C-NMR assignments, and therefore the 
supplementation of previously published data (see Table 2 and in the Materials and 
Methods). 
All isolated compounds were identified for the first time from C. arenaria, but 
the compounds represent mainly the characteristic secondary metabolites of the genus. 
Methoxylated flavones, such as eupatilin (1), eupatorin (2), 3’-methyleupatorin (3) and 
apigenin (4) and a flavonol [isokaempferid (5)] were described previously from 
different Centaurea species (Hegnauer 1989). Similarly, the germacranolide cnicin (6) 
was detected in some Centaurea species (Tesevic et al., 2007). The

dibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignans, such as arctigenin (7), arctiin (8) and matairesinol 
(9), often occur in Centaurea species (Ferguson et al., 2003; Janackovic et al., 2004, 
2008; Marco et al., 2005), but sesamin-type lignans [such as (+)-syringaresinol (10)] 
were previously unknown in this genus. N-Feruloylserotonins (11 and 12) had been 
found earlier only in two species of the genus (C. moschata and C. nigra) (Sarker et al. 
1997; Kumarasamy et al., 2003); the serotonin conjugates were reported to accumulate 
in the seeds. In agreement with Sarker’s group, we obtained a 1:2 mixture of cis and 
trans isomers, and observed that, after successful RP-HPLC separation, the compounds 
readily formed the mixture again. 
The isolated compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on HeLa, 
MCF7 and A431 cells (Table 3), and it emerged that flavone, sesquiterpene and lignan-
type compounds and a serotonin conjugate exerted pronounced concentration-dependent 
effects. The highest activity was demonstrated by the lignan arctigenin (7), with IC50 
values of 0.73 µM (HeLa), 3.47 µM (MCF7) and 4.47 µM (A431). Apigenin (4), cnicin 
(6) and matairesinol (9) inhibited the proliferation of all three tumour cell lines 
significantly. Arctiin (8) and eupatorin (2) were also active against the HeLa and A431 
tumour cells. Eupatilin (1) and moschamine (11) exerted high or moderate potency 
selectively against the A431 cell line. 
The lignans exhibited an interesting character of activity, involving relatively 
low calculated IC50 values, which were comparable to those of reference compounds 
[arctigenin (7): Hela 0.271 µM, MCF7 3.47 µM and A431 4.47 µM; matairesinol (9): 
HeLa 7.51 µM, MCF7 36.23 µM and A431 19.92 µM], and a limited maximal effect, 
which was typically around 75% inhibition of the cell proliferation (Fig 1). 
Isokaempferid (5) displayed unique activity: it caused a concentration-dependent

inhibition of the cytotoxicity of the Hela cells, but increases in proliferation of the A431 
and MCF7 cells (Fig 1). These results relate to cancerous cell lines and therefore do not 
permit direct conclusions concerning normal cells. However, extracts prepared from 
related Centaurea species have been reported to exert wound-healing activity, which 
can be explained by a stimulation of normal epidermic tissue proliferation (Csupor et 
al., 2009; Koca et al., 2009). The results allow the speculation that isokaempferid (5) 
may play a crucial role in the advantageous action exerted by similar plants on tissue 
regeneration. 
In summary, our bioactivity-guided isolations led to the conclusion that the 
strong inhibitory effect of the CHCl3 extract of C. arenaria on the proliferation of 
cultured human tumour cell lines (HeLa, MCF7 and A431) may be attributed mainly to 
flavones, lignans and sesquiterpenoids, other compounds [isokaempferid (5) and 
moschamine (11)] exerting additional effects.
