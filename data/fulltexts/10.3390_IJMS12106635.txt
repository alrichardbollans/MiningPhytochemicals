Abstract: A GC-MS-Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) detection method was developed  
for simultaneous determination of four monoterpenes: (−)-menthone, (+)-pulegone, 
(−)-limonene and (+)-menthofuran as the main bio-active and toxic constituents, and four 
other main compounds in the volatile oils of Schizonepeta tenuifolia (ST) leaves and spikes 
at different harvesting times. The results showed that the method was simple, sensitive and 
reproducible, and that harvesting time was a possible key factor in influencing the quality 
of ST leaves, but not its spikes. The research might be helpful for determining the 
harvesting time of ST samples and establishing a validated method for the quality control 
of ST volatile oil and other relative products.

1. Introduction 
The dried aerial part of Schizonepeta tenuifolia (Benth.) Briq. (ST, also called Jingjie in China) has 
long been popularly employed in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan as a traditional 
medicinal herb for the treatment of colds, headaches, fevers, skin rashes (pruritus and rubella) and

other disorders [1]. Much research regarding pharmacological actions in vivo and in vitro has shown its 
extracts (aqueous or methanolic) to have various biological and pharmaceutical properties, including 
antipruritic [2], hemostatic activity [3,4], and effects on the immune system [5,6]. The volatile 
components were recognized as the major constituents responsible for its biological effects. The 
volatile oil distilled from its aerial part and spike showed potent anti-inflammatory [7] and fumigant 
activity [8–10]. 
The volatile oils of ST contain many mono-terpenoids, including (−)-menthone, (+)-pulegone, 
(−)-limonene and (+)-menthofuran [11]. (−)-Menthone has been used as a fragrance in household 
products, components of artificial volatile oils, and tooth-brushing powder [12]. (−)-Limonene is one 
of the most common mono-terpenes in nature. It is a major constituent in several citrus oils (orange, 
lemon, mandarin, lime, and grapefruit). (−)-Limonene was listed in the Code of Federal Regulations of 
the USA as generally recognized as safe for a flavoring agent and can be found in common food items 
such as fruit juices, soft drinks, baked goods, ice cream, and pudding. (−)-Limonene was considered to 
have fairly low toxicity [13]. (+)-Pulegone is a natural mono-terpene obtained from the volatile oils of 
a variety of plants. It was used in flavoring agents, perfumery and aromatherapy. However, a recent 
study showed that it could cause severe hepatotoxicity, and its metabolism generated p-cresol; a 
glutathione depletory [14]. (+)-Menthofuran is a toxic furan terpenoid from various mint oils  
that was oxidized by mammalian cytochrome P450 to hepatotoxic metabolites. Evidence has been 
presented that p-cresol and other unusual oxidative products were metabolites of (+)-menthofuran in rats 
and that p-cresol might be responsible in part for the hepatotoxicity caused by (+)-menthofuran [15]. In 
addition, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, β-myrcene and β-caryophyllene were also main constituents of ST 
volatile oil, which had different biological activity. 1-Octen-3-ol and 3-octanone were both typical 
“moldy” odorants [16]; β-myrcene had a potent hepatoprotective action [17]; and β-caryophyllene was 
a functional cannabinoid receptor (type 2) agonist [18]. 
Many Chinese Patent Medicines were manufactured by using commercially available ST volatile 
oil or steam-distilled volatile oil from herb as a raw material. Their quality and content of bioactive 
component are influenced significantly by the climate, the cultivation conditions and even the time of 
harvesting and processing methods. In order to ensure stable quality of the crude herbs, many 
companies have adopted the good agricultural practice (GAP) for traditional Chinese medicine. In the 
process of establishing GAP of ST, the time of harvesting could not be determined because no relative 
data existed about the content variation trend of bioactive and toxic constituents in ST volatile oil  
over time. 
So, the aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the differences in the content of four 
monoterpenes including (−)-menthone, (+)-pulegone, (−)-limonene and (+)-menthofuran as the main 
bio-active and toxic constituents, and four other main compounds in the volatile oils of S. tenuifolia 
leaves and spikes at different harvesting times by using the gas chromatography-mass 
spectroscopy-selected ion monitoring detection method (GC–MS–SIM). Additionally, this research 
could be helpful to provide a validated method for the quality control of ST volatile oil. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

2. Material and Methods 
2.1. Plant Materials 
The aerial parts of Schizonepeta tenuifolia were obtained at seven different harvesting times (listed 
in Table 1) from a Good Agriculture Practice (GAP)-based herbal garden which is located in Anguo, 
Hebei province. Herbs were then authenticated by Professor Qinan Wu, the botanist of the College of 
Pharmacy at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China). Voucher specimens were also 
deposited at the herbarium at the above location. Plant materials were carefully cleaned and separated 
into two or three parts: leaf, stem and spike (if it existed), then a clevenger apparatus method was 
employed for the steam-distillation of volatile oils from separated leaf and spike parts. About 60 g of 
dried leaves or spikes were used for every sample.

2.3. Preparation of Sample and Standard Solutions 
Volatile oil samples were extracted by water distillation for 4 hours from 60 g of ST leaf and spike, 
respectively, using a set of standard apparatus, according to the procedure described in the 
Pharmacopoeia of the Peoples’s Republic of China [19]. The volatile oils were isolated from water and 
dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate until the last traces of water were removed and then stored in 
the dark glass bottles at −20 °C. Fifty milligrams of the volatile oil sample were accurately weighed 
and transferred into a 10 mL volumetric ﬂask, and 1 mL solutions of the two internal standards 
(containing 1.727 mg/mL of naphthalene and 0.252 mg/mL of n-decane in ethyl acetate) were 
transferred into the same ﬂask, respectively, and made up to volume with ethyl acetate. 
A mixed standard stock solution containing the eight reference compounds was prepared in ethyl acetate. 
The concentration of each compound in the stock solution was 284.64 µg/mL for 1-octen-3-ol (1), 
53.24 µg/mL for 3-octanone (2), 100.12 µg/mL for β-myrcene (3), 802.80 µg/mL for (−)-limonene (4), 
3.990 mg/mL for (−)-menthone (5), 24.42 µg/mL for (+)-menthofuran (6), 7.389 mg/mL for 
(+)-pulegone (7) and 157.28 µg/mL for β-caryophyllene (8), respectively. Working standard solutions were 
prepared by diluting the mixed standard stock solution with ethyl acetate to give six different 
concentrations within the ranges: (1), 5.7–227.7 µg/mL; (2), 1.1–42.6 µg/mL; (3), 2.0–80.1 µg/mL;  
(4), 16.1–642.2 µg/mL; (5), 79.8–3191.7 µg/mL; (6), 0.5–19.5 µg/mL; (7), 147.8–5911.0 µg/mL and  
(8), 3.1–125.8 µg/mL for calibration curves. 1.0 mL of double internal standards was also added into 
each solution of calibration. 
All of the sample and standard solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane prior to 
injection. They were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C before analysis. 
2.4. GC-MS-SIM Analysis 
1.0 µL of assayed solution was injected into Agilent 6890N (Agilent Technology, Austin, TX, USA) 
gas chromatograph (consisting of a 5975B mass selective detector and Agilent chemstation software 
package) equipped with an auto sampler (split ratio; 20:1). The analysis GC column was an HP-5MS 
(5% Phenyl Methyl Siloxane) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm ﬁlm thickness). Helium 
(He) was the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The GC temperature program was as follows: 
initial temperature was 50 °C, increased to 90 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, at the temperature maintained 
for 5 min; then increased to 160 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 10 min. The injection 
temperature was 220 °C, transfer line temperature was 280 °C, and ion source temperature was 230 °C. 
The mass spectrometer was operated at 70 eV in the electron impact mode with selected ion 
monitoring (SIM) mode. The selected ion groups for the identification of eight compounds in SIM 
mode were listed in Table 2. The dwell time for each ion was set at 50 ms. n-decane and naphthalene 
were used as two internal standards (IS) for quantification. The GC-MS-SIM chromatograph of eight 
compounds was shown in Figure 2. The chemical identities of the resulting components were determined 
by matching their recorded mass spectra with the data bank mass spectra (NIST libraries) provided  
by the instrument software. The structures of the components were further conﬁrmed by authentic 
standards analyzed under the conditions mentioned above. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

2.5. Validation of the GC-MS-SIM Method 
The dilute solution of the reference compounds was further diluted to a series of concentrations 
with ethyl acetate to assess the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ). The LOD and 
LOQ were determined as signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of 3 and 10, respectively. The intra- and 
inter-day precision was determined by analyzing calibration samples during a single day and on three 
consecutive days, respectively. To confirm the repeatability, five different working solutions were 
analyzed. The R.S.D. was taken in order to measure precision and reproducibility. The recovery test 
was used to evaluate the accuracy of this method. In the test, reference compounds were added to the 
L3 sample, and then analyzed as described above. The average recoveries were estimated by the 
formula: recovery (%) = (amount found − original amount)/amount added × 100%, and R.S.D.  
(%) = (S.D./mean) × 100%. For determination of the eight compounds, a calibration curve with double 
internal standards for each marker was constructed and tested for linearity. Their regression equations 
were calculated in the form of Y = AX + B, where Y and X (µg/mL) were peak area ratio of each 
component to the internal standard and compound concentration injected, respectively. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Identification of Chemical Components in the Volatile Oils 
GC-MS-SIM Chromatogram of volatile oils from ST leaves and spikes, were shown in Figure 2. All 
the main components were separated completely in 35 min, and the eight compounds for quantification 
were identified on the basis of comparison of their mass spectra with NIST05 database through MSD 
ChemStation D.05.01, and with mass spectra of standard compounds, respectively. The results were 
listed in Table 2, and the structures of the identified compounds were shown in Figure 1. 
3.2. GC-MS-SIM Method Validation 
The proposed chromatographic  method was validated to determine the linearity, LOD, LOQ, 
intraday and interday precisions, and accuracy. All calibration  curves showed good linearity  
(r
2 > 0.9990) within relatively wide concentration ranges, and the overall LODs and LOQs were less 
than 12.5 and 41.7 µg/mL, respectively (Table 3). The intra- and interday variations, repeatability, and 
stability RSD values of the eight compounds were all <2.37% and were shown in Table 4. The overall 
recoveries fell between 97.50 and 105.45% for the eight reference compounds, with RSDs of <2.76% 
(Table 5), which indicated that the established method was accurate enough for the determination of 
the eight compounds in the ST volatile oil samples. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

3.3. Quantification of the Eight Compounds 
The established GC-MS-SIM method was then subsequently applied to the simultaneous 
determination of the eight compounds in the volatile oil samples collected at different harvesting times. 
The assay results of eight compounds in volatile oils were summarized in Table 6. (+)-Pulegone and 
(−)-menthone, two p-menthane monoterpenes (also found in other aromatic plants in the Lamiaceae, 
probably due to the same biosynthetic pathway [20]) were determined as being the predominant 
constituents of the ST volatile oil, accounting for 85%~95% of total oils. Harvesting period (around Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12                 
 
6642
flowering time) was a key stage for the biosynthesis of menthone in S. tenuifolia, in which pulegone 
was rapidly converted into menthone in leaves under regulation of (+)-pulegone reductase. Meanwhile, 
such bioconversion occurred much slower in spikes. (+)-pulegone was also found to be the single 
dominant constituent of spikes.

In Table 6, the content of (−)-menthone, an important bio-active constituent, increased from the 
growing stage (in late August) to the stage of fruitage (in early October) in ST leaves. However, it 
decreased from the spikes’ formation stage (in early September) to the stage of fruitage in ST spikes. 
The content of (−)-limonene, another bio-active constituent, did not vary much with harvesting time in 
ST leaves or spikes. The content of (+)-pulegone, a main toxic constituent, obviously decreased from 
the growing stage to the stage of fruitage in ST leaves, but it showed a slightly increasing trend from 
the spikes’ formation stage to the stage of fruitage in ST spikes. The content of (+)-menthofuran, 
another toxic compound, had virtually the same variation trends in ST leaves and spikes. The  
contents of other four compounds for quantification remained relative stable during the different  
harvesting times. 
All of the results demonstrated that the optimum harvesting time of ST leaves was possibly in the 
stage of fruitage (in early October), and the optimum harvesting time of ST spikes was possibly in the 
spikes’ formation stage (in early September). However, the content of (+)-pulegone, only one 
dominant constituent of ST spikes, showed a very slightly increasing trend during the harvesting times. 
Therefore, harvesting time is possibly not a key factor for influencing the quality of ST spikes. 
4. Conclusions 
This is the first report about the simultaneous determination of eight main constituents in ST oils by 
using each authentic standard compound as a reference. The developed method was simple, sensitive 
and reproducible. Based on the analytical method, the quantitative comparative analysis was 
performed for the bio-active and toxic constituents of ST leaves and spikes at different harvesting 
times. The results showed that harvesting time was a key factor in influencing the quality of ST leaves, 
but not its spikes, which would be helpful for determining the harvesting time of ST samples and 
further establishing GAP of ST to ensure the quality of ST products. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12
