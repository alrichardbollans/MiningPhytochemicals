ABSTRACT
The essential oils of two varieties of Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora Nees & Eberm, Lauraceae), known as
Hon-Sho and Ho-Sho cultivated in experimental stands in Southern Brazil were studied. The essential oils were
obtained from the leaves and twigs of young plants by hydrodistillation. The identification of the components was
performed using GC, GC/MS and retention indexes on  methyl silicone and carbowax phases. The main components
identified were linalool in the Ho-Sho and camphor in the Hon-Sho.
Key Words: Cinnamomum camphora; leaves; essential oils; GC/MS; linalool; camphor.

INTRODUCTION
Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora Nees &
Eberm, Lauraceae) essential oils have been
extensively studied (Guenther,1950). The tree is
native to China, Formosa and Japan (Yoshida et
al., 1969). The traditional oils are obtained from
the wood and bark (Stahl, 1957; Dung and Khien,
1991; Pandey et al., 1997). The oil with a high
content of camphor has an important antifungal
activity (Takaoka et al., 1976; Sattar et al., 1991).
C. camphora has several chemical varieties which
have different essential oil compositions (Hattori,
1981; Huergo et al., 1978;  Lin et al., 1994;
Akeng´a et al., 1994; Moellenbeck et al., 1997;
Dung et al., 1993). Two varieties have been
exploited commercially, Hon-Sho (C. camphora
Nees & Eberm.), the most valuable for the
presence of camphor, and Ho-Sho (C. camphora
Nees & Eberm var. linaloolifera Fujita) for it high
content of linalool. These varieties are
morphologically similar, but they show different
essential oil compositions and for this reason are
considerated physiological varieties (Guenther,
1950).
The oils obtained from the leaves by steam
distillation have economic importance as their
main components are camphor and linalool
(Guenther, 1950), and their explotation is less
detrimental to the trees . The compositions of the
essential oils from aerial parts have been reported
by many authors (Fujita et al., 1974;  Pellisier et
al., 1995; Stahl, 1957).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pla t material. The aerial parts of young plants of
Camphor tree (C. camphora Nees & Eberm and C.
camphora Nees & Eberm var linaloolifera Fujita)
were collected in May 1998 at the Experimental
Farm of the Instituto de Biotecnologia of the
Universidade de Caxias do Sul, Brazil. The
specimens were identified and deposited at the
Herbarium of the Museu de História Natural of the
Universidade de Caxias do Sul (C. camphora Nees
& Eberm, Hon-sho,Voucher Nº HUCS 12.892 and
C. camphora Nees & Eberm var. linaloolifera
Fujita, Ho-sho, Voucher Nº HUCS 12.891).
Ess ntial oil. The essential oil was obtained with a
yield of 0.84% (w/w) to the Ho-Sho and 0.72 %
(w/w) to the Hon-Sho from the aerial parts, by a 1
hour hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type
apparatus, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.
An lytical. GC analysis were performed on a
Hewlett Packard 6890 Series, equipped with a HP-
Chemstation data processor, in two columns. The
first was a HP-5 bonded phase capillary column
(30 m x 320 mm i.d.), 0.25 mm film thickness
(Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, USA); FID detector;
column temperature, 60°C (8min) to 180°C at
3°C/min, 180-230°C at 20°C/min, 230°C
(20min.); injector temperature 250°C ; split ratio
1:50; detector temperature 275°C; carrier gas H2
(32 kPa), volume injected 0.1 mL.
The second was a HP-Innowax bonded phase
capillary column (30 m x 320 mm i.d.), 0.50 mm
film thickness (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, USA),
column temperature, 40°C (8min.) to 180°C at
3°C/min, 180-230°C at 20°C/min, 230°C
(20min.); injector temperature 250°C ; split ratio
1:50; detector temperature 250°C;carrier gas H2 
(34 kPa), volume injected 0.1 mL.
GC-MS analysis were conducted using a
Shimadzu QP 5050 equipped with Adams library,
using two capillary columns. The first was a fused
silica capillary column, (25 m x 250 mm i.d.),
stationary phase SE-52, 0.25 mm film thickness
(Mega, Legnano, Italy) ; column temperature,
60ºC (8 min) to 180ºC at 3ºC/min, 180-230ºC at
20ºC/min, injector temperature 250ºC; split ratio
1 :40 ; volume injected, 0.2 mL of the oil. He gas
was used as a carrier, using 122.2 kPa (51.6
mL/min); interface  temperature 250ºC ; detector
1.15 kV ; acquisition  mass   range 40-400 ;
solvent cut, 2 min.
The second was a fused silica capillary column,
(25 m x 250 mm i.d.), stationary phase BP-20, 0.25
mm film thickness (SGE, Australia); column
temperature, 40ºC (8 min) to 180ºC at 3ºC/min,
180-230ºC at 20ºC/min. Injector temperature
250ºC ; split ratio 1 :40 ; volume injected, 0.2 mL
of the oil. Carrier gas was He, 92.6 kPa (55.9
mL/min); interface temperature 250ºC ; detector
1.10 KV ; acquisition mass range 40-400 ; solvent
cut, 2 min.
The constituents of the oil were identified by the
combination of mass spectral and retention
indexes and they were compared with both those
of reference authentic compounds and from library
spectra data and literature (Adams, 1995; Jennings
and Shibamoto, 1980) and are reported in Tables 1
(Hon-sho) and 2 (Ho-sho).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Hon-Sho leaf oil obtained in Caxias do Sul
showed 31 components. 94% of the composition is
made by monoterpenes and 2% by sesquiterpenes.
Oxygenated terpenes represented 81% of the total,
camphor being the main component (68%) and
linalool the second most important (9%).
The camphor content was similar to that described
for Pakistan (Sattar et al., 1991) and Ivory Coast
(Pelissier et al. 1995) leaf oils.
The Ho-Sho leaf oil was almost exclusively
formed by linalool (95%), with no other
constituent representing more than 1%. In this the
product is similar to the most common
compositions described in the literature  (Lin and
Hua, 1987; Tao et al., 1987; Fujita et al. , 1974;
Dung et al., 1993), where linalool content varied
from 66 to 91%. Contents of cineol and nerolidol
described for cetain samples (Lin and Hua, 1987;
Nguyen et al., 1994) could not be confirmed in
B zilian samples.
