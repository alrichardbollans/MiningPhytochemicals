ABSTRACT
The senescence-promoting substance of wormwood (Artemisia absin-
thium L.) as detected by the oat (Avena sativa L. cv "Victory") leaf assay
has been identified as (-)-methyl jasmonate, methyl (IS, 2R)-3-oxo-2-(2'-
cis-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-l-acetate, by gas-liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry and optical rotatory dispersion. Its senescence-promoting
effect was much stronger than that of abscisic acid, and even at such a low
concentration as I to 2.5 micrograms per milliliter, it could completely
eliminate the anti-senescence action of 2 micrograms per milliliter kinetin.
Comparing the biological activity of the (-)- with the (±)-forms of methyl
jasmonate, it seemed that only the (-)-form was biologicalHy active.
Senescence of green plant tissues is characterized by the loss of
various cell components, especially Chl (3). Cytokinins delay the
senescence (21) and ABA accelerates it (2). Actinomycin D (20),
chloramphenicol and thiouracil (23) are also known to accelerate
the yellowing of various plant tissues. These substances can elim-
inate the antisenescence action ofcytokinins. A high concentration
of L-serine has been reported to possess a similar effect in oat leaf
segments, especially in the presence of cytokinin, possibly through
enhancement ofprotease biosynthesis ( 12). In barley leaf segments
a high concentration of EDTA has a bleaching effect only in the
light (1 1).
We have recently found that an extract ofwormwood (Artemisia
absinthium L.) contains a senescence-promoting factor as exam-
ined by using oat (Avena sativa L. cv "Victory") leaf segments.
The extracts of wormwood have been known to inhibit the seed
germination and growth of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) (16),
and the inhibition was shown to be associated with absinthin,
artemetin, and other related compounds contained in this plant
(15). Our preliminary studies show that the senescence-promoting
factor is none of the above-mentioned compounds, and that it is
a non-polar substance such as esters on the basis of its chromato-
graphic behavior. It is not ABA-methyl ester and was thought to
be a physiologically new compound.
This paper reports on the purification and identification of this
substance. Comparative data on the biological activity of this
factor and ABA are also presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material. Leaves and stems of wormwood (Artemisia
absinthium L.) were harvested on our campus June, 1977 through
August, 1978. They were washed with tap water, weighed, and
stored at -20 C before extraction.
Bioassay. The oat (Avena sativa L. cv "Victory") leaf was used
according to Thimann's method (17). Seeds were germinated in
Vermiculite and seedlings were grown under continuous white
fluorescent light of about 5000 lux at 25 C for 7 days. The upper
3-cm leaf segments of first leaves were excised for the assay. Ten
such leaf segments were placed on two layers of Toyo No. 2-filter
paper moistened with 5 ml of test solutions in a sterilized Petri
dish. The test substance or ABA was dissolved in water containing
500 jig/ml of the surfactants Tween 80: Span 80 (7:3, w/w) with
or without 2 ,ug/ml kinetin. Controls were treated with the same
medium without kinetin. The Petri dishes were kept in a dark
room at 25 C. The leaf segments were sampled at 2 or 4 days after
treatment and their Chl contents were determined. The initial Chl
content was determined before incubation. Kinetin and ABA were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.
Detenmination of Chl Content. The Chl content of the leaf
segments was estimated as follows. The leaf segments of each
sample were extracted with 10 ml of boiling 80o aqueous ethanol
for 30 min. The extract volume was made up to 10 ml with 80%
aqueous ethanol and the A of the extract was measured at 665 nm
with a Hitachi model 101 spectrophotometer. The mean A of four
to eight experiments was calculated. The results were expressed as
percentages of the initial value, or the value for 2 ,ug/ml kinetin
treatment.
ISOLATION OF THE SENESCENCE-PROMOTING FACTOR
Extraction and Solvent Fractionation. Leaves and stems (9.7
kg) were homogenized with a blender and extracted with 20 liters
of 80o aqueous acetone three times. All the extracts were com-
bined and concentrated at 35 C in vacuo to give an aqueous
residue. The aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 2.5 with 2 N
HCI and extracted with 4 liters of ethyl acetate three times. Since
the active factor was in the neutral ethyl acetate fraction, the
acidic ethyl acetate fraction was extracted with 2 liters of 5%
NaHCO3 solution to remove acidic materials. The neutral ethyl
acetate fraction was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and then
evaporated to dryness in vacuo to give an active crude material of
9.9 g.
PURIFICATION
Charcoal Adsorption Column Chromatography. Crude material
(9.9 g) was dissolved in a small amount of 10%1o aqueous acetone,
charged onto a column packed with charcoal (100 g of Wako
charcoal for chromatography; 2.3 x 36 cm) and eluted with
acetone-water. The acetone content of the mixture was increased
in a series of 10% steps and the fractions eluted with 70 and 80%'o
aqueous acetone contained the active factor (4.4 g).
Silicic Acid Adsorption Column Chromatography. Active factor
eluted with 70 and 80%1o aqueous acetone (4.4 g) was dissolved in
a small amount of benzene, charged onto a column packed with
silicic acid (50 g of Wako-gel C 100; 1.0 x 42 cm) and eluted with

IDENTIFICATION OF (-)-METHYL JASMONATE
benzene-ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate content of the mixture
was increased in a series of 5% steps. The eluate with benzene-
ethyl acetate (95:5) contained the active factor. The eluate of this
fraction was evaporated to dryness and 111 mg of an active brown
oil was obtained. It was dissolved in a small amount of n-hexane,
charged onto a column packed with the same silicic acid (10 g; 1.0
x 8 cm) and eluted with n-hexane-ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate
content of the mixture was increased in a series of 10%1o steps. The
eluate with n-hexane-ethyl acetate (90:10) contained 17 mg of the
active factor.
Thin-layer Chromatography. Thin layers of silica gel GF254 with
0.25 mm thickness and PF25 with 0.5 mm thickness from Merck
Co. Ltd. were used for analytical and preparative TLC, respec-
tively. Seventeen milligrams of partially purified active factor was
further purified on preparative TLC developed with (A) n-hexane-
ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v, multiple development). The active zone of
RF 0.27-0.37 was scraped off and eluted with ethyl acetate to give
5 mg of an active yellow oil. It was finally purified by preparative
TLC developed with (B) benzene-ethyl acetate (10:1, v/v). The
active zone of RF 0.30-0.34 was scraped off and eluted with ethyl
acetate, giving on evaporation 1 mg of an odoriferous yellow oil.
Gas-liquid Chromatography and Combined Gas Chromatogra-
phy-Mass Spectrometry. GLC was carried out on a Hitachi model
163 gas chromatograph fitted with a hydrogen flame ionizing
detector. A 3 mm x 2 m glass column was packed with 5% SE-30
on 80-100 mesh Gas Chromosorb W. The carrier gas was N2 at
flow rate of 30 ml min-'. Column temperature was 180 C (isoth-
ermal condition), and that of injection and detector parts was 210
C.
GC-MS was carried out with a Hitachi RMU-6L spectrometer
connected with a Hitachi 063 gas chromatograph. OV-1 (2%) on
silanized Chromosorb W packed in a 3 mm x 1 m silanized glass
column was used. The ionizing voltage was 70 electron volts.
Measurements of Optical Rotatory Dispersion. The ORD1 of
the senescence-promoting factor (0.21 mg) in methanol (2 ml, c
= 0.0105) was recorded by a JASCO ORD/CD spectrometer
model J-20, with a cell of 0.1 dm in width. The operating temper-
ature was 25 C.
RESULTS
Identification of the Senescence-promoting Substance. The se-
nescence-promoting substance of wormwood was isolated and
purified as an odoriferous yellow oil (I mg). This active substance
ran as a homogeneous spot on analytical TLC in solvent A or B
and showed a single peak in GLC with 5% SE-30 at 180 C
(isothermal, Fig. 1). As shown in Figure 2, the mass spectrum of
the GLC peak at 3.8 min gave ions at m/e ratios of 224 (37, MW),
206 (13), 193 (17), 177 (14), 156 (24), 151 (50), 135 (20), 133 (20),
121 (17), 109 (34), 95 (44) and 83 (100, base peak) and corre-
sponded to the formula C13H2003 suggesting that this active sub-
stance is methyl jasmonate. The identification was confirmed by
direct comparison of this substance with an authentic sample of
(+)-methyl jasmonate. The RF value in TLC and the retention
time in GLC of the sample agreed with those of the active
substance. In addition, the mass spectrum of the sample com-
pletely agreed with that of the active substance (Fig. 2).
The ORD of the isolated methyl jasmonate was determined in
a methanolic solution. The curve showed a negative Cotton effect
with peaks at 313 and 276 nm, and zero rotation at 298 nm. The
data is presented in Table I. These ORD characteristics agreed
with those reported previously for (-)-methyl jasmonate, methyl
(1S, 2R)-3-oxo-2-(2'-cis-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-acetate (6, 9,
10).
On the basis of the above evidence this active substance of
wormwood was identified as (-)-methyl jasmonate.

Biological Activity of (-)-Methyl Jasmonate. In the bioassay,
the senescence of control leaf segments proceeded rapidly soon
after their excision. At 2 days, Chl content decreased to about 50%
of initial value, and at 4 days to about 10%1o. In the presence of
(-)-methyl jasmonate at 0.1 and 1.0 .g/ml, the loss of Chl in the
leaf segments was even more rapid: at 2 days Chl dropped to
about 30o of the initial value (Fig. 3).
The interaction of methyl jasmonate with kinetin, a senescence-
retarding hormone, was examined. In the presence of 2 jig/ml
kinetin about 80%o of the initial Chl content was retained 4 days
after treatment. The kinetin activity was suppressed by methyl
jasmonate, the suppression being marked at concentrations more
than 0.1 tg/ml (Fig. 4). On the concentration range between 0.1
and 2.5 .tg/ml, the senescence-promoting activity of (-)-methyl
jasmonate was higher than that of (±)-methyl jasmonate. In
addition, the minimum concentration of the racemic mixture
needed for complete decolorization of the leaf segments was about
2 to 5 times higher than that of the (-)-enantiomer.
The interaction of ABA with kinetin was also examined for
comparison. Four days after treatment about 26.4 ,ug/ml of ABA
was needed to eliminate the anti-senescence action of 2 ,ug/ml
kinetin (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
The senescence-promoting substance isolated from wormwood
(Artemisia absinthium L.) was identified as (-)-methyl jasmonate.
This compound was first isolated from jasmine oil (Jasminum
grandiflorum L.) as an odoriferous compound (6). It was also
found in the essential oil of Tunisian rosemary (Rosmarinus
officinalis L.) (4). However, no biological activity of methyl jas-
monate was described in these reports. This is the first time that
its biological activity as a senescence-promoting factor has been
demonstrated.
The ORD of methyl jasmonate isolated in this study is levoro-
tatory, while naturally occurring ABA is dextrorotatory (13).
Milborrow showed that (+)- and (-)-ABA possessed an equal
degree of inhibitory activity for the growth of wheat coleoptile
(14). Sondheimer et al. (18) reported that there were great differ-
ences in the inhibition of the root-related growth of germinating
barley seeds between these enantiomorphs, while they were almost
equally active in the inhibition of the shoot growth. The isolated
methyl jasmonate (levorotatory) is more active in counteracting
kinetin than synthetic methyljasmonate (racemate) (Fig. 4). More-
over, natural methyl jasmonate has been shown to be about 2 to

Exogenous ABA can accelerate senescence of excised plant
tissues as manifested by pigment loss (2). In the present study
ABA has also been shown to promote leaf senescence and to
eliminate the anti-senescence action of kinetin (Fig. 5). The effec-
tive concentration ofABA is physiologically low enough to suggest
that it acts as a hormone. Other compounds which are known to
promote senescence as described in the "Introduction" are either

metabolic inhibitors or those which require high concentrations to
manifest ABA-like activity. Levorotatory methyl jasmonate can
accelerate leaf senescence both in the presence and absence of
kinetin and its activity at low concentrations is much stronger
than that of ABA.
Compounds which are structurally related to methyl jasmonate
are known to be widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The free
acid of methyl jasmonate (iasmonic acid) has been isolated from
the culture filtrates of Lasiodiplodia theobromae as a growth
inhibitor of green plants (1). It has also been isolated from the
leaves and galls of chestnut (Castanes crenata Sieb et Zucc.) (19),
and the immature seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (24) and has been
reported to have a similar effect. In addition, 5'-hydroxyjasmonic
acid and the lactone of this compound have been found in the

essential oil ofjasmine (J. grandiflorum L.) (7), and N-jasmonoyl-
and N-dihydrojasmonoyl-isoleucin have been shown to occur in
the fermentation medium of Gibberellafujikuroi (5). Cucurbic acid
and its derivatives which have recently been isolated from seeds
of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) as plant growth inhibitors have
structures closely related to that ofjasmonic acid (8).
Considering the wide occurrence ofjasmonic acid and its related
compounds in the plant kingdom together with its ABA-like
activity in promoting leaf senescence at low concentrations, these
substances might be physiologically significant natural regulators.
Since methyl jasmonate is a volatile compound, it could be a
volatile hormone in regulating the senescence and stomata aper-
ture of oat leaf segments as has been suggested by Thimann et al.
(22).
