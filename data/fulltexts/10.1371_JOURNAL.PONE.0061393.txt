Abstract
Gentiana lutea belonging to the Gentianaceae family of flowering plants are routinely used in traditional Serbian medicine
for their beneficial gastro-intestinal and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the study was to determine whether
aqueous root extracts of Gentiana lutea consisting of gentiopicroside, gentisin, bellidifolin-8-O-glucoside, demethylbelli-
difolin-8-O-glucoside, isovitexin, swertiamarin and amarogentin prevents proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells in
response to PDGF-BB. Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis were performed based on alamar blue assay and propidium
iodide labeling respectively. In primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs), PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) induced
a two-fold increase in cell proliferation which was significantly blocked by the root extract (1 mg/ml). The root extract also
prevented the S-phase entry of synchronized cells in response to PDGF. Furthermore, PDGF-BB induced ERK1/2 activation
and consequent increase in cellular nitric oxide (NO) levels were also blocked by the extract. These effects of extract were
due to blockade of PDGF-BB induced expression of iNOS, cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Docking
analysis of the extract components on MEK1, the upstream ERK1/2 activating kinase using AutoDock4, indicated a likely
binding of isovitexin to the inhibitor binding site of MEK1. Experiments performed with purified isovitexin demonstrated
that it successfully blocks PDGF-induced ERK1/2 activation and proliferation of RASMCs in cell culture. Thus, Gentiana lutea
can provide novel candidates for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

Introduction
Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neo-intimal thickening post
angioplasty involves excessive migration and proliferation of
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from media into the lumen of blood
vessels. Increased expression of several growth factors such as basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF)-BB contribute to atheroma formation [1]. These agonists
by activating the PI-3kinase and/or the mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways promote migration and proliferation of
vascular smooth muscle cells leading to their subsequent accumu-
lation in the plaque [2,3].
Plant derived extracts have been extensively used in traditional
medicine worldwide. These phytochemicals, which are rich in
flavonoids and xanthones, exhibit beneficial health effects by
imparting protection against hepato- or neuro-toxicity [4]. For
example, members of the Gentianaecae family are used in Serbian
and Peruvian folk medicines to treat digestive disorders. Similarly,
Swertia plants also belonging to the Gentianaecae family are in use
in Asian medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties [5,6].
Additionally, xanthones and glucosides obtained from G lutea, and
G austriaca extracts have radio-protective properties [7–9]. Active
principles of these extracts include the bitter tasting secoiridoids
such as gentiopicroside, amarogentin and swertiamarin, and
flavonoids and xanthones such as isovitexin and isogentisin
respectively [10,11]. Analysis of several commercially available G
lutea extracts have demonstrated that the most abundant
compound in them is gentiopicrioside (4.46–9.53%) followed by
swertiamarin and xanthone glycosides, while gentisin and iso-
gentisin are seen in much lower concentration (0.02–0.11%) [10].
Work done with purified isogentisin, has demonstrated that it
protects endothelial cells from cigarette smoke induced cell death
[12] while gentiopicriocide exhibits smooth muscle relaxing effects
[13]. These studies hence suggest that Gentiana species may have
beneficial cardio-vascular effects however the molecular mechan-
isms employed by these compounds are currently ill-understood.
In this study, we investigated the role of G lutea root extract on
PDGF-BB induced proliferation of primary cultures of rat aortic
smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Additionally we examined the
effects of G lutea extract on PDGF-BB induced cell cycle
progression and signal transduction involving ERK1/2 activation
and iNOS expression.

and all the other dry lab chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA. HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were
from J.T.Baker (Deventer, Netherlands).
2.2 Plant Material and Extract Preparation
Gentiana lutea plant roots were purchased from the Institute of
Medicinal Plant Research ‘‘Dr. Josif Pancic’’, Belgrade, Serbia.
Aqueous root extracts were prepared by boiling the gentian roots
in water (in ratio 1:20, m/V) for 10 minutes, followed by filtration
though 0.45 mm filters (Millipore Co. Ltd) as described previously
[14,15]. Frozen extracts were lyophilized and stored in sample
tubes until further analysis at a dry place. At the time of
experimentation the extracts were reconstituted in sterile distilled
water (at a concentration of 10 mg/ml) and filtered through
0.22 mm filter for further use.
2.3 Isolation and Culture of Smooth Muscle Cells
Male Wistar rats weighing 100–150 g were procured from
Kings Institute, Chennai. The protocol employed for isolation and
culture of aortic smooth muscle cells was approved by the
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee at the Indian Institute of
Technology Madras in accordance with Indian Council of
Medical Research, Government of India guidelines. These
guidelines are formulated in accordance with U.S. National
Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory
animals. Thoracic aorta were obtained and subjected to collage-
nase based enzymatic digestion for isolation of smooth muscle cells
as previously published [16]. Cells were seeded and cultured on to
collagen coated 6-well tissue culture dishes in DMEM-F12
medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin, strepto-
mycin, fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor in
a humidified atmosphere of 5%CO2–95% air as reported
previously [16]. Prior to experimental treatments, cells were
serum-starved over-night. All experiments were done with
quiescent cells up to passage two.
2.4 Immunoblotting
Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline
followed by lysis in Triton X lysis buffer (20 mmole/LTris,
100 mmole/L NaCl, 10% triton X-100, 1 mmoleL/L EDTA, 1
mmole/L sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mmole/L sodium pyrophos-
phate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1X protease inhibitor from
Sigma). Following separation on polyacrylamide gels, proteins
were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride
(PVDF) membranes from Amersham. Transferred proteins were
incubated with respective primary and secondary antibodies as per
manufacturer’s instructions and equal loading of blots was
confirmed by re-probing the blots with b-actin. Enhanced
chemiluminescence based ECL plus detection kits were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Beverly, MA, USA.

2.5 Nitric Oxide (NO) Measurements via DAF2-DA
Imaging
Cultured SMCs were serum starved prior to treatment with
PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in presence or absence of Gentiana lutea
extract for given time duration. For measurement of intracellular
NO, cells were co-incubated with 10 mmole/L DAF2-DA and
1 mmole/L L-arginine as nitric oxide synthase substrate. Release
of NO was scored as appearance of green fluorescence due to
binding of cellular NO to DAF2 dye. DAF2-DA is a cell
permeable dye, which loses its diacetate moiety upon entering
the cell due to action of cellular esterases and fluoresces upon
binding to NO [17]. Images were captured using Olympus
immunofluoroscence microscope equipped with ProgResCapture-
Pro 2.7 camera followed by analysis with ImageJ software (NIH).
2.6 Alamar Blue Assay
Cell viability was measured by Alamar Blue assay [18]. Briefly,
Alamar blue (Resazurin sodium salt from Sigma) was dissolved in
phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 to make a stock of 1 mg/mL
and a final working concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in cell culture
medium. Resazurin is a redox indicator, which measures the
reducing environment of the cell by reducing to a pink colored
resorufin. Following experimental treatments with PDGF-BB
(20 ng/ml, 24 hours) in presence or absence of Gentiana extract
(1 mg/ml), the cells were treated with alamar blue dye. Colour
change was monitored colorimetrically at 590 nm and 570 nm to
evaluate oxidized versus reduced forms respectively of the reagent
by using multi-mode plate reader from Spectramax.
2.7 Cell Cycle Analysis
RASMCs were seeded on collagen coated 6-well dishes and
were maintained in growth medium until they reached 70%
confluence. They were then serum starved over-night for
synchronization followed by treatment with PDGF-BB (20 ng/
ml) with or without G lutea extract for up to 24 hours. Cells were
trypsinized, centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes and the
pellets were re-suspended in 0.3 ml PBS. Cell fixation was done
with ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4˚C for 16 hours. Fixed cells were
vortexed and briefly centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes,
followed by re-suspension of pellet in PBS containing 10 mg/ml
RNAaseA and propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) for staining. Follow-
ing incubation at 37˚C for 1 hour, the PI-DNA complex in the
nucleus of each cell was measured using FACS Diva (Becton and
Dickinson Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Subsequent analysis to
determine percentage of cells in various stages of cell cycle was
done using FlowJo software.
2.8 Docking Analysis
Docking analysis of Gentiana lutea constituents onto human
MEK1 were performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm of
AutoDock4 [19]. Putative docking sites were first identified using
the entire macromolecules as search space followed by rigid
docking at the sites of high binding energy. The PDB ids of MEK1
used for the analysis were 3EQF and 3EQH [20]. These are
crystal structures of ternary complexes of MEK1 with Mg2+ATP
and inhibitors K252a and U1026 respectively. The chemical ids of
the ligands used for the study were: CID 9912413 for K252A, CID
3006531 for U1026, CID 88708 for gentipicroside, CID 115149
for amarogentin, CID 162350 for isovitexin, CID 442435 for

swertiamarin, and CID 5281636 for gentisin. The search
parameters for docking analysis were as follows: Grid parameters:
number of points, 62662662, spacing: 0.375 A˚ (Rigid docking),
1.0 A˚ (Blind docking), number of runs: 100, initial population size:
150, maximum number of evaluations: 2500000, maximum
number of generations: 27000 and default values were used for
all the other parameters.
2.9 Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean6SEM for a minimum of four
independent experiments and statistics were performed using
Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism software. P values ,0.05
were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
3.1 Determination of Cytotoxic Concentrations of the
Extract
UPLC and MALDI-TOF analyses previously carried out on the
extract [14], reported presence of following compounds: gentisin,
bellidifolin-8-O-glucoside, demethylbellidifolin-8-O-glucoside, iso-
vitexin, swertiamarin, amarogentin and getiopicroside. Among
these, the major constituent of the extract was gentiopicroside as
already reported [14]. We first determined the concentration of
the extract at which it will inhibit proliferation by 50% (IC50) for
primary cultures RASMCs, rat and human specific aortic smooth
muscle cell lines A7r5 and ATCC CRL-1999 respectively. These
were found to be 2.22 mg/ml for primary cultures of RASMCs,
2.7 mg/ml for A7r5 and 3.43 mg/ml for human cell line as shown
in figure 1.
3.2 Effect of Extract on PDGF-BB Induced Cell
Proliferation
We then sought to determine whether co-incubation of smooth
muscle cells with G lutea extract (1 mg/ml) for 24 hours blocks
PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) induced proliferation. As seen in figure 2,
the extract significantly blocked PDGF-BB induced conversion of
resazurin (alamar blue reagent) to its reduced form resorufin both
in primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (fig. 2A) and
A7r5 cell line (fig. 2B). This effect was however not due to
induction of apoptosis which was scored as Annexin V labeling
(fig. 2C), neither was it due to interference of resazurin indicator
with extract alone (data not shown). We then analyzed the effect of
extract on cell cycle progression. Over-night serum starvation was
done to achieve 8562% synchronization of cells in G0/G1 phase.
Cells were then treated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB and were
analyzed at 12 and 18 hours post treatment for entry into S and
G2/M phase using propidium iodide labeling (fig. 3A). The
percentage of cells in S phase increased from 5.562% in control
cells to 16.2561.1% and 24.2561.1% at 12 and 18 hours
respectively in response to PDGF-BB (fig. 3B). While number of
cells in G2/M phase increased from 9.2560.75% at control to
16.0061.3% at 12 hours and 21.0061.6% at 18 hours. Treatment
with G lutea extract significantly inhibited entry of synchronized
cells in to S and G2/M phase in response to PDGF-BB as seen in
figure 3A and B.
3.3 PDGF-BB Activates ERK1/2-nitric Oxide Axis
PDGF-BB treatment time dependently increased the activation
of ERK1/2 which was measured as increase in Threonine202 and
Tyrosine204 phosphorylation of ERK1 and dual phosphorylation
of ERK2 at Threonine185 and Tyrosine187 (fig. 4A). ERK1/2
activation was seen from one minute onwards and was observed
till 30 minutes. PDGF treatment also increased levels of
intracellular nitric oxide (NO) as early as 30 seconds (fig. 4B&C).
Early increase in nitric oxide coincided with Akt mediated Ser1177
phosphorylation of endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) (fig. 4D). This residue in eNOS activates the NO synthase
activity [21]. An increase in the expression of iNOS was also seen
in response to PDGF from 30 minute onwards (fig. 4E). Inhibition

NAME respectively blocked PDGF-BB induced proliferation
(fig. 5A&B). We then determined the effect of root extract on
PDGF-BB induced cellular NO. The G lutea root extract,
completely blocked cellular NO induced by PDGF-BB (fig. 5C).
3.4 G lutea Extract Blocks PDGF-BB Induced Cell Signaling
We then sought to determine the intracellular signaling affected
by the root extract. The aqueous extract failed to block PDGF
induced PDGF receptor tyrosine auto-phosphorylation at Tyr751
(fig. 6A) suggesting that its mode of action is down-stream of the
receptor. However, it blocked PDGF-BB induced ERK1/2
activation (fig. 6B). Consequently the phosphorylation of IKKa
a downstream target of ERK1/2 was also blocked by the extract
(fig. 6C). Since IKK-NFkB axis is directly involved in activating
transcription of iNOS [22], we determined the effect of the extract
on PDGF-BB induced expression of iNOS. Indeed the extract
blocked PDGF induced expression of iNOS (fig. 6D&E). Among
the cell cycle regulators, the G lutea extract decreased PDGF-BB
induced expression of PCNA and cyclin D1 (fig. 6D&E).
3.5 Docking Analysis with Extract Components
Since MEK1 is the known dual specificity kinase which
phosphorylates the threonine and tyrosine residues in the
activation loopes of ERK1 and ERK2 in order to activate them
[23,24], we set out to determine if any of the extract components
interact with MEK1 through docking analysis. Due to lack of
crystal structure for MEK2 and ERK1 we could not perform the
analysis on these molecules. Using the Lamarckian algorithm of
the AutoDock4 program blind and rigid docking of the extract
constituents were done with x-ray structure of human mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase1 (MEK1) as described in methods.
It should be noted that human MEK1 shares considerable
homology with rat MEK1. Figure 7A depicts complexes of known
inhibitors K252a and U1026 as well as isovitexin with MEK1.
Among the components tested the best binding energies were
predicted for isovitexin as seen in table 1. Isovitexin was found to
bind to similar sites as K252a (for PDB id: 3EQF) and U1026
(PDB id: 3EQH) in MEK1 (fig. 7A). Residues which were found to
be in close contact with isovitexin in 3EQF were Lys97, Leu115,
Leu118, Val127, Met143, Glu144, His145, Met146, Leu197 Cys207,
Asp208, Phe209, Gly210 and Val211. Among these, isovitexin
exhibits propensity of hydrogen bonding with Lys97, Met146,
Asp208 and Val211. Residues which were in close contact with
isovitexin in 3EQH were Lys97, Leu118, Ile141, Asp208, Phe209,
Val211, Leu215, Ile216, Met219 and Ala220. Of these, isovitexin
exhibits possibility of hydrogen bonding with Val211. We then set
out to determine experimentally whether purified isovitexin indeed
blocks PDGF-BB induced signaling and proliferation in primary
cultures of RASMCs. As seen in figure 7B, isovitexin at varying
concentrations successfully blocked PDGF-induced ERK1/2
activation and entry of cells in to S-Phase. Effect of isovitexin on
PDGF-induced proliferation was also confirmed via alamar blue
assay (fig. 7C).

proliferative diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis [25].
Proliferation and migration of VSMCs in response to PDGF
triggers intimal thickening post-angioplasty [2]. Use of PDGF
receptor antagonists blocks both in vitro proliferation of VSMCs
and atherosclerosis in animal models [2,26]. In the present study,
we demonstrate that aqueous extract of G lutea roots effectively
blocks PDGF-BB induced cell cycle progression by interfering with
ERK1/2-iNOS signaling (as summarized in fig. 8). These effects of
the extract were neither due to cytotoxicity nor due to apoptosis.
Entry and progression of cells through different stages of cell
cycle is a tightly orchestrated process. It involves sequential
activation and expression of regulatory proteins such as cyclins,
cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors, p53 and pRb
[27,28]. Activation of CDK2 and CDK4 in complex with cyclin
D1 mediates progression of cells from G0/G1 to S phase. CDK2 in
turn is involved in phosphorylation of pRb and accumulation of
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [29]. Phosphorylation of
pRb is also mediated by ERK1/2, wherein activated ERK1/2
directly phosphorylates pRb at Ser780 and Ser795 residues [30].
This event precedes cyclin D1 expression and is necessary for the
release of transcription factors in order to promote DNA synthesis.
We observed an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon
PDGF-BB treatment, which was blocked by the G lutea extract.
Consequently, the extract also blocked PDGF-BB induced
expression of cyclin D1 and PCNA. However, the extract failed
to block PDGF-BB induced PDGF-receptor tyrosine phosphory-
lation, thereby indicating that the site of action for the extract and
its constituents is downstream of the receptor. Effects of ERK1/2
activation on cell cycle vary depending upon the type of cells
involved. For instance, in fibroblasts ERK1/2 activation leads to
G1 to S phase entry via cyclin D1 expression, while in epithelial
cells it is required for G2 to M phase entry through cyclinB1 and c-
fos [31]. Although we did not look for effect of G lutea extract on
cyclinB1 and c-fos expression, given that the extract effectively
blocks ERK1/2 activation we believe, it utilizes the same
mechanism for blocking G2 to M phase entry of cells in response
to PDGF-BB.
In the present study we also observed that PDGF-BB induced
production of intracellular NO was significantly blocked by the G
lutea extract. The exact effect of nitric oxide on cell cycle depends
upon its local concentration. At low concentrations it promotes cell
proliferation while at higher doses it induces cytostatic and/or
apoptotic effects [32,33]. Since in this study NOS inhibitor L-
NAME blocked PDGF-BB induced cell proliferation we believe
that intracellular NO in response to PDGF-BB promotes smooth
muscle cell proliferation. Although the molecular mechanisms by
which NO promotes cell proliferation are not well understood,
recent studies have highlighted its ability to inhibit apoptosis by
preventing the DNA binding activity of p53 [34] and through S-
nitrosylation of caspases [35,36].
The major sources of NO in cells are the various isoforms of
NO synthases (NOS) such as iNOS (inducible isoform), nNOS
(neuronal isoform) and eNOS (endothelial isoform) [37,38].
Among these eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed while
iNOS expression is transcriptionally induced in a MAPK-de-
pendent manner upon agonist activation [37]. ERK1/2 activates
the IKK-NFkB axis in order to activate transcription of iNOS
[22]. We observed that PDGF-BB induced activation of ERK1/2
in vascular smooth muscle cells was responsible for increased
expression of iNOS. Intriguingly, abundant expression and
activation of ERK1/2 is seen in atheroma samples derived from
hyperlipidemic mice [39]. Similarly, increased iNOS expression
and activity is reported in VSMCs obtained from diabetic rats
[40]. Involvement of iNOS in pathology of atherosclerosis is also
supported by the fact that its deficiency reduces atherosclerotic
plaques [41] and neo-intimal thickening [42] in rodent models.
These reductions are either due to decreased LDL oxidation [41]
or due to G0/G1 arrest of iNOS deficient VSMCs [43]. We also
observed G0/G1 arrest of VSMCs in presence of G lutea extract.
Additionally the extract blocked PDGF-BB induced iNOS
expression. Given these observations, it is tempting to speculate
that the active principles of Gentiana lutea root extract will prevent
neo-intimal thickening by blocking ERK1/2-iNOS activation.
MEK1/2 is the only known upstream kinase which can activate
ERK1/2 [23]. We hence carried out docking analysis of identified
constituents of the G lutea extract with the available crystal
structures of human MEK1. Two crystal structures of MEK1 as
ternary complexes with known competitive inhibitor K252a
(PDBID: 3EQF) and allosteric inhibitor U1026 (PDBID: 3EQH)
were used for the analysis [20]. It was observed that among the
individual components, isovitexin was seen to dock to the same
binding pocket in MEK1 as K252a and U1026. It should be noted
that inhibitor binding site in MEK1 is adjacent to the Mg2+ATP
binding site and these two sites are physically separated by the side

chains of Lys97 and Met143, while the other neighboring amino
acids Leu118, Ileu141, and Phe209 form a deep hydrophobic pocket
within the core kinase domain extending from amino acid 53 to
369 [20,44]. Binding of K252a induces a conformational change
due to hydrogen bonding with Glu144 and Met146 and thus affects
catalytic activity of MEK1 [20]. On the other hand, although the
exact molecular mechanism of allosteric inhibition of MEK1 is still
unclear, crystal structure studies have predicted that binding of
allosteric inhibitors adjacent to active site induces and stabilizes
a basal and naturally occurring inactive form of MEK1 [44].
Conformational change induced by these allosteric inhibitors
breaks a conserved ion pair formation between Glu114 and Lys97

Anti-Proliferative Effects of Gentiana Extract

in the ATP binding site of the enzyme. Among the G lutea
components analyzed, isovitexin was found to dock to the same
site as K252a and U1026 and demonstrated a propensity of
hydrogen bonding with catalytic residues Lys97, Met146, Asp208, or
Val211. Furthermore in cell culture experiment isovitexin success-
fully blocked PDGF induced proliferation of RASMCs.
Plant derived polyphenols and carotenoids delay the onset and
progression of atherosclerosis by modulating serum lipid levels and
by reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Some of these
also block VSMC proliferation such as ellagic acid [45],
Naringenin [46], luteolin [47] and lutein [48]. Binding of
PDGF-BB to its cognate receptor followed by auto-phosphoryla-
tion, triggers generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [49]. ROS then reversibly inactivate protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPase), the known negative regulators of PDGF
receptor signaling [50]. Alternatively these free radicals activate
ERK1/2 pathway by activating ERK1/2 phosphorylating kinases
such as Src, Pyk2 and Syk [51]. Since polyphenolic content of an
extract imparts greater antioxidant capacity and given that both
water and ethanol extracts of Gentaian lutea roots have high
polyphenol content as already reported by us [15], it is likely that
the extract through its radical scavenging activity is directly
modulating PDGF induced ERK1/2 activation. Additionally
others have shown that polyphenols obtained from numerous
other Gentiana species act as antioxidants and effectively block
lipid peroxidation [52–55]. As the receptor tyrosine phosphory-
lation was unaltered by the extract (fig. 5A), we believe that the
anti-oxidant effect of the extract would lie downstream of the
receptor but upstream of ERK1/2 activation. Thus antioxidants
such as isovitexin [56] and gentisin present in the water extract
may inactivate these kinases thereby blocking ERK1/2 activation.
This however needs to be tested in our future studies.
Diabetes increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia
observed in these patients favors glucose metabolism through
polyol pathway and induces formation of advanced glycation end
products (AGEs) [57]. These pathways along with pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines and growth factors promote diabetic micro- and
macro-vascular complications. Aldose reductase (AR) the rate
limiting enzyme in ployol pathway, upon over-expression,
accelerates atherosclerotic lesions in apoE2/2 mice [58].
Furthermore, its inhibition successfully blocks bFGF, angiotensin
II, AGEs, hyperglycemia and PDGF-AB induced proliferation of
vascular smooth muscle cells [59–61]. These effects of AR
inhibitors are through their ability to attenuate ERK1/2-NFkB
signaling leading to cell cycle arrest at G1 phase [61]. Intriguingly,
the methanol and ether extracts of Gentiana lutea roots were recently
shown by our co-authors to inhibit rat and human isoforms of AR,
thereby preventing sorbitol accumulation under high glucose
conditions [14]. Molecular docking studies identified amarogentin
as a potential inhibitor of AR [14]. The present study identifies
isovitexin as yet another anti-atherosclerotic agent in aqueous
extract of Gentiana lutea roots. Similar studies on cancer cell lines
have demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of root extracts of
Gentiana triflora [62], but to the best of our knowledge this is the first
study demonstrating anti-proliferative effects of Gentiana lutea
extract on vascular smooth muscle cells. Although nothing is
reported regarding the anti-diabetic effects of Gentiana lutea,
isoorientin obtained from another Gentianaceae member, Gentiana
oliveri, exhibits hypoglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects in
streptozotocin induced diabetic rats [63]. Thus it becomes
imperative to study even the hypoglycemic effects of Gentiana lutea
extracts in future. Recent work by Nastasijevic´ et.al., has shown
that gentiopicroside, isovitexin and amarogentin present in the
root extracts of Gentiana lutea are effective inhibitors of myeloper-
oxidase [64]. It should be noted that myeloperoxidase is an early
marker of vascular dysfunction and plays a crucial role in oxidative
modification of LDL and hence in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
[65]. Given these observations and our current study we propose
that Gentiana extracts and their constituents can provide drug
leads to come up with effective anti-atherosclerosis therapy in
future.
Conclusion
In conclusion, aqueous root extract of Gentiana lutea and its
constituent isovitexin effectively blocks PDGF-BB induced pro-
liferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells by blocking ERK1/2
activation and consequent iNOS expression.
