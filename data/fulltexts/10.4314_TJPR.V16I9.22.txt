Abstract 
Purpose: To investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanol extract of the immature fruit of a 
citrus, Shiranuhi, and to identify the active ingredient. 
Methods: The immature Shiranuhi peel was extracted with 80 % ethanol, and the extract was 
fractionated with solvents (n-hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol) to afford the corresponding fractions 
and water residue. Among them, the EtOAc-soluble portion was subjected to medium pressure liquid 
chromatography (MPLC) over a reversed-phase SiO2 column to give compound 1. The isolated 
compound was identified based on the proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. 
The release of nitric oxide, prostaglandin (PG)E2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and 
IL-6 secreted by mouse macrophages was measured using RAW264.7 cell culture supernatant.  
Results: Shiranuhi (Korean name, Hallabong) is an important citrus species cultivated in Jeju Island, 
Korea. A polymethoxyflavonoid (PMF), tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1), was isolated from the peels of 
immature Shiranuhi fruit. Upon the evaluation of anti-inflammatory effects, the flavonoid 1 decreased the 
nitric oxide production in macrophage cells with high efficiency, viz, 50 % inhibition concentration, IC50 
of 57.4 μM. Subsequent studies demonstrated that PMF 1 effectively inhibited the generation of PGE2, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokine in a dose-dependent manner.  
Conclusion: Tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1) has been successfully isolated from Shiranuhi species for 
the first time. Thus, Shiranuhi fruit peel extract containing PMF 1 can potentially be applied as an anti-
inflammatory ingredient in food or cosmetic industries.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Citrus is a genus of trees producing important 
fruits such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and 
limes. Mandarine oranges (C. reticulata) are 
widely cultivated in subtropical areas of China, 
Japan, and Korea. The dried peels of Citrus fruits 
have been used in Chinese medicine for the cure 
of stomachache, skin inflammation, muscle pain, 
cough, and high blood pressure [1]. 
Phytochemical studies of Citrus peels have led to 
identifying some metabolites including flavonoids 
[2,3], limonoids [4,5], and coumarins [6]. 
Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) have attracted 
considerable attention as bioactive constituents 
in Citrus peels [2,7] owing to their anti-
inflammatory [8], anticarcinogenic [9], and 
antiatherogenic properties [10]. Besides, 
Hyun et al 
Trop J Pharm Res, September 2017; 16(9): 2198  
 
antioxidant [11,12] and antitumor properties [13] 
were also identified from the flavonoids of Citrus 
genus.  
 
Shiranuhi is the generic name of a hybrid Citrus 
species [(Citrus unshiu Marc. × C. sinensis 
Osbeck) × C. Reticulata Blanco)], and its fruit is 
large size with a characteristic sweet taste. 
Shiranuhi fruit (Korean name, Hallabong) is 
produced in large quantities from orchards in 
Jeju Island, Korea [14]. Within the Citrus species, 
Shiranuhi is relatively unexplored as the source 
of phytochemical studies searching for 
cosmeceutical or functional food ingredients. In 
the process of our investigation to develop 
bioactive ingredients from the plants available in 
Jeju Island, the ethanol extracts prepared from 
the peels of immature Shiranuhi fruit exhibited 
anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, we 
decided to identify the chemical constituents 
responsible for the activities.  
 
Polymethoxyflavonoid compounds have been 
isolated from various Citrus plants including C. 
sinensis and C. reticulata [15,16]. Essential oil 
from the peels of Shiranuhi exhibited high radical 
scavenging and anti-bacterial activities [17]. So 
far, there is no report on the ingredients 
responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity from 
Shiranuhi plant. The anti-inflammatory activities 
of the extracts and the isolated compound were 
determined by LPS-induced RAW264.7 murine 
macrophage cells.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Plant material 
 
Immature Shiranuhi peels were collected from 
the Citrus Research Institute (RDA) in Jeju 
Island, South Korea. An authenticated voucher 
specimen (no. 463) was deposited at the 
herbarium of Natural Product Chemistry, 
Department of Chemistry and Cosmetics, Jeju 
National University. 
 
Extraction and isolation 
 
Immature Shiranuhi peels (1,085 g) were dried in 
the shade and extracted with 80% ethanol three 
times by stirring using a mechanical stirrer at 
room temperature for 24 h. The combined 
ethanol extract was filtered, and the filtrate was 
concentrated using a vacuum evaporator to give 
a gummy extract (146.8 g). A part of the citrus 
extract (60.0 g) was suspended in distilled water 
(3 L) and fractionated with three solvents (n-
hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), affording 
the corresponding solvent fractions and water 
residue. Among the fractions, the EtOAc-soluble 
fraction (5.0 g) was purified by medium-pressure 
liquid chromatography (MPLC, Biotage co.) 
instrument equipped with a C18 SiO2 column (KP-
C18-HS, Biotage Co.). Elution of the fraction with 
H2O–MeOH (10 – 100 %) solvent gradient 
provided 39 subfractions. Among them, 
subfraction 31 (126.8 mg) was identified as the 
pure compound. Analytical grade solvents were 
used in this experiment. 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR, 500 MHz; 
13C NMR, 125 MHz) were obtained using an 
AVANCE III (FT-NMR system, Bruker co.) 
instrument, and the chemical shift (δ) data are 
reported in ppm relative to the NMR solvent 
used. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass 
analyses were performed on a Waters Quattro 
micro Tandem mass system (Waters, USA). 
 
Cell culture  
 
Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line was 
purchased from American Type Cell Culture 
(Rockville, MD, USA). The cell (RAW264.7) 
culture was prepared in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium (GIBCO Inc., NY, USA) 
supplemented with streptomycin (100 μg/mL), 
penicillin (100 U/mL), and 10% fetal bovine 
serum (GIBCO Inc., NY, USA). The cells were 
incubated in 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. 
 
WST-1 assay for cell viability 
 
Tetrazolium salt WST-1 [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-
nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] 
(Roche, Germany) was employed for the cell 
viability assays. The assay was performed 
following the manufacturer protocol. Murine 
RAW264.7 macrophage cells (1.5 × 105 cells/mL) 
were cultured in 24-well plate for 18 h, followed 
by treatment with 1 μg/mL of LPS in the 
presence of various samples. After 24 h cell 
incubation, WST-1 was added to the medium 
and it was allowed to stand for 1 h. The 
supernatant was measured at 440 nm with 
reference 600 nm. Cell viability was determined 
as the ratio of the sample absorbance to that of 
control. 
 
Measurement of nitric oxide concentration  
 
The NO production was determined by the 
Griess reagent (Sigma, USA). In this assay, the 
accumulated nitrite ion originated from the NO in 
the culture medium was monitored by a 
colorimetric method. Briefly, after RAW264.7 
macrophage cells (1.5 × 105 cells/mL) were 
incubated for 18 h, the cells were treated with 
LPS and various concentrations of samples (total 
volume, 1 μg/mL) for 24 h. Then, the equal 
volume of Griess reagent was added to the 
Hyun et al 
Trop J Pharm Res, September 2017; 16(9): 2199  
 
supernatant, and incubated at room temperature 
for 10 min. The produced nitrite ion was 
determined using a microplate reader (Sunrise™, 
Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland) at a wavelength 
of 540 nm. The percent inhibition for each 
sample was calculated as. 
 
Inhibition (%) = [(Control – Sample) / Control] × 
100 
 
Measurement of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 
cytokines  
 
The production of PGE2 and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) was 
determined in the culture supernatant of 
RAW264.7 cells. In a 24-well cell culture plate, 
the macrophage cells were placed at an 
appropriate density (1.5 × 105 cells/mL) with 
culture medium (1 mL) and incubated for 18 h. 
Then, the cells were treated with a sample 
(specified concentration) and LPS (1 μg/mL) and 
incubated for an additional 24 h. The amount of 
PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 produced by the 
cells was measured using an ELISA kit (PGE2, 
IL-1β; R&D systems, TNF-α, IL-6; Invitrogen) and 
a microplate reader according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
Means (± standard error of the mean) of the data 
are presented, and statistical analysis of the 
results was carried out by Student's t-test using 
Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, 
USA) for independent samples. Values of p 
<0.05 and p <0.01 were considered significant as 
appropriate. 
 
RESULTS 
 
At first, the ethanol extracts were examined for 
the anti-inflammatory activities using RAW 264.7 
cells. The extract (100 μg/mL) prepared from the 
immature Shiranuhi peels inhibited LPS-induced 
NO production in the macrophage cells by 8 % 
(Figure 1). The ultimate goal of this study was to 
determine the anti-inflammatory chemical 
constituents in the extracts. Thus, the extract 
was partitioned in the order of polarity using

solvents (n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-butanol) to 
afford corresponding fractions as well as the 
remaining water residue. Each solvent fraction 
was again subjected to the activity test for the 
generation of NO. Figure 1A shows that both the 
n-hexane and EtOAc fractions possess strong 
NO inhibition activities. However, the WST-1 
assay indicated that the n-hexane fraction have 
considerable cell toxicity. In contrast, the EtOAc 
fraction mostly maintained cell viability at a 
concentration up to 100 μg/mL, indicating that 
the cell-destruction effect is rarely involved in the 
observed NO inhibition. Figure 2 shows the NO 
inhibition and cell toxicity data of the EtOAc 
fraction under various concentrations (25 – 100 
μg/mL), indicating that the EtOAc fraction 
decreased the NO generation in a dose-
dependent manner. The EtOAc fraction was 
selected for further purification to isolate the 
active ingredient, because it strongly inhibited 
NO synthesis without causing cell toxicity at 100 
μg/mL (Figure 2B). 
 
EtOAc fraction was separated by MPLC and 
silica gel column chromatography, leading to the 
isolation of compound 1. The chemical structure 
of compound 1 was elucidated by the 
interpretation of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. 
Compound 1 showed 13 carbon peaks in the 13C 
NMR spectrum, a characteristic indication of the 
presence of a flavone skeleton. The signal at δ 
177.4 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum indicates 
the presence of a carbonyl group at C-4 position. 
The 13C signals at δ 62.4, 61.7, 56.4, and 55.6 
ppm correspond to the four methoxy groups at 
the C-5, C-6, C-7, and C-4′ positions, 
respectively. 
 
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 revealed 
that it has an A2B2 system (H-2′/H-6′ and H-3′/H-
5′), as demonstrated by the coupling constant 
Hyun et al 
Trop J Pharm Res, September 2017; 16(9): 2201  
 
signals at δ 7.81 (d, H-2′, H-6′) and δ 6.99 (d, H-
3′, H-5′), and one methoxy group at position C-4′. 
The aromatic proton singlet signals at δ 6.56 and 
6.77 ppm were assigned to the H-3 and H-8 in 
the structure. Four proton signals for the methoxy 
groups at the H-5, H-6, H-7 and H-4′ were 
observed at δH 3.86, 3.89, 3.95, and 3.96, 
respectively.

By careful examination of the NMR data 
discussed above, compound 1 was identified as 
a polymethoxyflavone, tetramethyl-O-scutellarin 
(Figure 3). The 1H NMR and 13C NMR data are 
as follows: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.81 
(2H, d, J = 9.0, H-2′, 6′), 6.99 (2H, d, J = 9.0, H-
3′, 5′), 6.77 (1H, s, H-8), 6.56 (1H, s, H-3), 3.96 
(3H, s, 4′-OCH3), 3.95 (3H, s, 7′-OCH3), 3.89 
(3H, s, 6-OCH3), 3.86 (3H, s, 5-OCH3); 13C NMR 
(125 MHz, CDCl3) δ 177.4 (C-4), 162.3 (C-2), 
161.3 (C-4′), 157.8 (C-7), 154.6 (C-5), 152.7 (C-
9), 140.4 (C-6), 127.8 (C-2′, 6′), 124.0 (C-1′), 
114.5 (C-3′, 5′), 113.0 (C-10), 107.2 (C-3), 96.4 
(C-8), 62.4 (5-OCH3), 61.7 (6-OCH3), 56.4 (7-
OCH3), 55.6 (4′-OCH3). ESIMS (positive-ion 
mode): m/z 343 (M+H)+. The suggested structure 
was finally confirmed by the comparison of the 
observed data to the literature values [18]. As far 
as we know, tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1) was 
isolated for the first time from Shiranuhi fruit. 
 
The bioactivity test flavonoid 1 was also tested 
using RAW 264.7 cells under under varying 
concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μM). When 
activated by LPS, RAW 264.7 cells increased the 
nitric oxide (NO) production by 12 fold (Figure 
4A). The treatment of tetramethyl-O-scutellarin 
(1) to the activated macrophage cells decreased

the NO production with high efficiency (IC50 = 
57.4 μM)) in a dose dependent manner. The 
potential cytotoxicity of the isolate 1 was 
determined by the WST-1 assay, where the cells 
were incubated for 24 h with or without LPS 
(Figure 4B). In this test, cell viability mostly 
unchanged at the employed concentrations (25, 
50, and 100 μM), suggesting that the NO 
inhibitory effect of isolate 1 had nothing to do 
with its cell toxicity. To further elucidate the anti-
inflammatory mechanism of PMF 1, 
inflammation-related substances such as PGE2, 
IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were monitored in culture 
supernatants by ELISA. As shown in Figure 5, 
LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells significantly 
produced the inflammatory cytokines (Figure 5). 
This experiment clearly revealed that flavonoid 1 
reduced the production of the cytokines (PGE2, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) with high to medium 
degree in a concentration dependent manner 
(Figure 5 and Figure 6). 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
If body tissue is exposed to a variety of stimuli, 
inflammation occurs as a biological response. 
Inflammation is commonly characterized by 
blood flow increase to the damaged tissue 
inducing temperature rise, redness, swelling and 
pain. It is mediated by different types of signaling 
molecules produced by various cells. 
Macrophages play an important role in 
inflammation-related disease through the 
secretion of molecular mediators such as NO, 
PGE2 as well as relevant cytokines including 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, 
and IL-6 [19]. 
 
Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are a class of 
compounds, with flavones as a base structure 
and methoxy substituents in different positions. 
Interestingly, PMFs exist mainly in Citrus genus 
in the plant kingdom. More than 30 PMFs have

been isolated from different parts of the citrus 
species including mandarin (C. reticulata 
Blanco)and sweet orange (C. sinensis) [20]. The 
structural types and ingredient contents of PMFs 
vary between different varieties of citrus plants. 
Among those isolated PMF derivatives, nobiletin 
and tangeretin have been intensively explored 
owing to their availability and interesting 
pharmacological activities. Numerous studies 
suggest that PMF compounds isolated from 
citrus display a broad spectrum of biological 
activity [21]. 
 
In this study, we isolated a polymethoxy-
flavonoid, tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1) as an 
active constituent from immature Shiranuhi peel 
and examined its anti-inflammatory activities. 
Shiranuhi is a hybrid Citrus species, and its fruit 
is produced in large quantities in Jeju Island of 
Korea. The isolated PMF 1 strongly inhibited the 
NO production with a high efficiency (IC50 57.4 
μM). The subsequent studies demonstrated that 
the flavonoid 1 effectively reduced the secretion 
of prostaglandin E2 as well as the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-
6 in a dose dependent manner.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1) has successfully 
been isolated for the first time from Shiranuhi 
citrus species. PMF compound 1 possesses anti-
inflammatory properties as indicated by the 
suppression of NO, PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α 
production in LPS-triggered macrophage RAW 
264.7 cells. The control of pro-inflammatory 
mediators (NO, TNF-α, and IL-6) has been an 
effective strategy for the development of novel 
anti-inflammatory materials. Thus, the results 
suggest that tetramethyl-O-scutellarin (1) derived 
from a citrus might be a potential agent for the 
treatment of inflammation-associated human 
health problems.
