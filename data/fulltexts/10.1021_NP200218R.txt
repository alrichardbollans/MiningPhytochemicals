Legumes (Fabaceae) are important agricultural crops, char-acterized by the presence of root nodules that contain
symbiotic nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria. Fixation of atmospheric nitro-
gen allows reduced fertilizer costs and makes legumes a key
player in crop rotation to replenish nitrogen-depleted soil.
Furthermore, legumes serve as a major source of proteins and
oil for human and animal nutrition. Leguminous crops with a
signiﬁcant economical value include oilseed crops such as
soybean (Glycine max) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea), forage
and soil-conditioning crops such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and
clover (Trifolium spp.), and pulses such as beans (Phaseolus spp.),
peas (Pisum spp.), and lentils (Lens spp.).
Themore than 19 400 leguminous species, distributed over 730
genera, produce a vast array of metabolites with diverse struc-
tures and biological activities. An important group of legume
natural products are triterpene saponins, a class of secondary
metabolites that display a wide range of biological activities.1 In
plants they serve as allelopathic, antipalatability, anti-insect, or
antifungal agents.2 Saponins also have a broad range of pharma-
ceutical properties, such as anti-inﬂammatory, antimicrobial,
anticancer, or adjuvant activities.3,4 Besides saponins, isoﬂavo-
noids, alkaloids, and nonprotein amino acids commonly occur as
natural products in several legume species.1,5
As a model species for legume biology, barrel medic (Medicago
truncatula), a close relative of alfalfa, is an excellent system to
study secondary metabolism of legumes.1,6 Consequently, several
studies about the metabolite composition of M. truncatula have
been published over the past decade. Metabolite proﬁling using
LC-MS-basedmethods revealed the presence of a complexmixture
of triterpene saponins in various M. truncatula tissues.2,79 In
accordance with other legumes from the Papilionoideae subfamily,
M. truncatula is rich in isoﬂavonoids.10,11
Hairy roots are generated by an infection of healthy plant
tissue, not necessarily roots, with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. They
are characterized by fast growth rates and do not require growth
regulators for their cultivation. Furthermore, they have a high
genetic stability and a high biosynthetic potential for a longer
time than natural roots.12,13 Their potential to produce com-
pounds that are also naturally occurring in wild-type roots in
combination with their tolerance to cultivation in large-scale
bioreactors makes hairy roots an appealing alternative for the
destructive harvesting of wild-type roots, especially those of
endangered plant species, to obtain valuable phytochemicals.14,15
Hairy roots are also a valuable tool to investigate the secondary
metabolism in M. truncatula. A prerequisite for the study of
secondary metabolism and its application in metabolic engineer-
ing projects is the possibility to generate transgenic plant tissue.
Although fertile transgenic M. truncatula plants can be obtained
via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation,1619 the

ABSTRACT: Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant
natural products, with an enormous variety in structure and
bioactivities. Here, triterpene saponins from hairy roots of the
model legumeMedicago truncatula were proﬁled with reversed-
phase liquid chromatography coupled to negative-ion electro-
spray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
mass spectrometry (LC ESI FT-ICR MS). Owing to the
accuracy of the FT-ICR MS, reliable molecular formulas of
the detected compounds could be predicted, which, together
with the generated MSn spectra, allowed the tentative identiﬁcation of 79 diﬀerent saponins, of which 61 had not been detected
previously in M. truncatula. Upon collision-induced dissociation of saponins that contain a uronic acid residue in the sugar chain,
fragment ions resulting from cross-ring cleavages of the uronic acid residues were observed. The identiﬁed saponins are glycosides of
10 diﬀerent sapogenins, of which three were not detected before inM. truncatula. Zanhic acid glycosides, which are prevalent in the
aerial parts of M. truncatula, were absent in the hairy root extracts. This metabolite compendium will facilitate future functional
genomic studies of triterpene saponin biosynthesis in M. truncatula.

published methods are time-consuming and lack the required
throughput for simultaneous analysis of a signiﬁcant number of
genes. In contrast, A. rhizogenes-mediated transformation of M.
truncatula seedlings allows a fast and eﬃcient production of
transgenic hairy roots;20 the generation time needed from seed to
a transgenicM. truncatula hairy root culture, ready for proﬁling or
other analysis, is only three months.
For any metabolic engineering project targeting triterpene
saponin biosynthesis, a detailed analysis of the saponin composi-
tion of the generated hairy roots is required. In the past decade, a
few metabolic proﬁling studies on saponins in M. truncatula have
been reported. In a ﬁrst study, the presence of a large number of
saponins in root extracts of M. truncatula was shown: based on
fragmentation data under negative ionization, 27 M. truncatula
saponins were tentatively identiﬁed.2 Optimization of the latter
method resulted in an extended list of 31 tentatively identiﬁed
saponins.7 In a later study, 12 additional saponins from the aerial
parts of M. truncatula were characterized via spectroscopic meth-
ods, and their fragmentation behavior under negative ionization
was reported.8,9 Nevertheless, M. truncatula was postulated to
synthesizemanymore triterpene saponins than identiﬁed to date.2
For identiﬁcation purposes, LC-MS-based metabolomics
studies beneﬁt from the use of Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). FT-ICR MS pro-
vides highly accurate mass measurements, allowing a reliable
prediction of the molecular formula of the detected ions. Here,
we applied reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled
to negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) FT-ICR MS to
investigate the saponin composition of hairy roots of M. trunca-
tula. As a result, 79 saponins were detected and tentatively
identiﬁed, of which soyasaponin I and 3-Glc-28-Glc-medicagenic
acid were the most abundant compounds. The identiﬁed sapo-
nins are glycosides of 10 diﬀerent sapogenins, of which three had
hitherto not been detected before in M. truncatula.
’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
General Methodology. For metabolite profiling of triterpene
saponins, the compounds from a methanol extract of M. trunca-
tula hairy roots were separated by reversed-phase LC, followed
by negative-ion ESI FT-ICR MS. The accurate m/z measure-
ments of the FT-ICR MS, combined with the isotope abun-
dances, allowed us to predict the molecular formula of the
detected saponins. The structural information needed for the
identification of the saponins was obtained by MSn fragmenta-
tion using the linear ion trap (IT). Full FT-MS spectra were

interchanged with dependent IT-MSn scan events, existing of an
MS2 and twoMS3 scans. In the MS2 scan, the most abundant ion
in the previous full MS scan was fragmented. The two most
abundant daughter ions in every MS2 scan event were subjected
to a dependent MS3 scan event. In addition, in-source fragmen-
tation data were included in the identification process.
Identification of Saponins. Saponins are amphipathic glyco-
sides consisting of a lipophilic aglycone or sapogenin covalently
linked to one (monodesmosidic) or more (di- or tridesmosidic)
sugar chains via an ether or ester glycosidic bond. The sugar
residues are mainly hexoses (e.g., glucose and galactose), 6-deoxy-
hexoses (e.g., rhamnose and furanose), pentoses (e.g., arabinose
and xylose), and uronic acids (e.g., glucuronic acid and
galacturonic acid). As reported before, upon collision-induced
dissociation (CID) under negative ESI-MS, saponins undergo
glycosidic cleavages, retaining the charge at the reducing terminus
(i.e., the fragment that contains the aglycone).21,22 The detected
(grand)daughter ions in the MSn spectra provide structural
information about the sugar residues and aglycone of the
fragmented saponin.
Figure 1 illustrates the identiﬁcation of a hitherto unknown
saponin. As indicated in Figure 1A, the unknown saponin showed
an [MH] anion atm/z 945.50965. Because saponins consist
of the elements C, H, and O, three diﬀerent molecular formulas
are possible within an error range of 5 ppm: C65H69O6 (δ ppm =
0.331), C40H81O24 (δ ppm = 2.830), and C47H77O19
(δ ppm = 3.380). To determine the correct molecular formula,
the abundance of the isotopes was considered. In nature, stable
elemental isotopes occur in a stable ratio. For instance, 13C
occurs at approximately 1.11% of the most frequent carbon
isotope, 12C. Similarly, 2H and 17O occur at 0.015 and 0.038% of
1H and 16O, respectively. Hence, the observed monoisotopic
quasi-molecular ions (M0) are always accompanied by additional
isotope ions (Mþ 1,Mþ 2, ...) (Figure 1B), of which the relative
abundance depends on the elemental composition of the com-
pound. The predicted relative abundance of the M þ 1 ions of
the three possible molecular formulas was 73.41, 46.53, and
54.05%, respectively. For the unknown saponin, the observed
relative abundance of the M þ 1 ion was 53.63% (Figure 1B),
indicating that the molecular formula corresponding to the [M
H] anion is C47H77O19 (δ ppm = 3.380). The sugar residues
and the aglycone could be identiﬁed from the MSn spectra. For
this saponin, MS2 fragmentation led to the generation of ﬁve
daughter ions, resulting from the loss of water (18 Da) and/or
one or more hexose (162 Da) and/or pentose (132 Da)
residues. The smallest daughter ion, at m/z 489, represents the
aglycone ion, [Agly  H], resulting from the loss of a pentose
and two hexose moieties (Figure 1C). Based on this rationale,
tens of other saponins present in the extract ofM. truncatula hairy
roots could tentatively be identiﬁed. All identiﬁed saponins and
their MSn data are listed in Table 1.
Cross-Ring Cleavage of Uronic Acid Residues. Saponins are
reported to undergo only glycosidic cleavages upon CID under
negative ESI-MS.21 However, in this study, we observed a
recurrent fragmentation pattern for saponins that contain a
uronic acid residue, indicating a cross-ring cleavage of the uronic
acid residue upon CID, as illustrated with the MS2 spectrum
observed for 3-Rha-Gal-GlcA-soyasapogenol B (Figure 2A,B).
The anions with the highest relative intensity, observed at m/z
923 and 879, correlated to the neutral losses of 18 (H2O) and 62
Da (H2O þ CO2), respectively. A similar pattern was observed
after the loss of the rhamnose residue (m/z 795), and the ions
observed at m/z 751 and 733 correlated to an additional loss of
44 (CO2) and 62 Da (H2Oþ CO2), respectively. Furthermore,
three more characteristic peaks were observed at m/z 615, 597,
and 525, corresponding to a loss of the galactose residue, and an
additional loss of 18 (H2O), 36 (H2OþH2O), and 108 Da. The
latter loss can only be explained by a cross-ring cleavage of the
uronic acid residue. Cross-ring cleavages of glycosides are charge-
remote fragmentations, i.e., fragmentations that are not initiated
by the charge position. Because of the low internal energy of
negative ions, cross-ring cleavages of glycosides do not readily
occur.21 An exception are those that are linked via an ester bond
as in, for example, feruloylated oligosaccharides23,24 or sinapoyl
glucose.25 Sinapoyl glucose serves as a UV protectant in Arabi-
dopsis, and upon CID in the negative ionization mode, losses of
60, 90, and 120 Da are observed,25 which correspond to a 0,4X,
0,3X, and 0,2X cross-ring cleavage, respectively (see legend of
Figure 2 for explanation on nomenclature). However, in this
study, the cross-ring cleavage of the uronic acid residue should be
charge-driven, because the carboxylic group of the uronic acid
bears the negative charge. The loss of 108 Da might be due to
the loss of water followed by an additional loss of a C3H6O3
fragment of 90 Da or by the loss of a C3H8O4 fragment involving
a 1,4X cross-ring cleavage of the uronic acid residue (Figure 2C).
This typical fragmentation pattern was observed in 20 com-
pounds and aided in the tentative identification of hitherto
unknown saponins. By means of this methodology, a total of
79 saponins present in theM. truncatula hairy root extracts were
identified (Table 1). However, MSn does not provide enough
information for absolute structural characterization of the meta-
bolites; hence, the identifications remain tentative.

Most Abundant Compounds inM. truncatula Hairy Roots.
In the metabolite extracts ofM. truncatula hairy roots, the major
peak, at a retention time (tR) of 33.63 min, yielded an [MH]
anion at m/z 941.51540 (C48H78O18, δ ppm = 4.101)
(Figure 3A). InM. truncatula, two saponins have been described
with the same molecular formula, Rha-Hex-Hex-hederagenin
and soyasaponin I (3-Rha-Gal-GlcA-soyasapogenol B).7 The
MS2 spectrum (Figure 2A and Table 1) corresponded to

previously observed MS/MS data of soyasaponin I,26 allowing us
to conclude that soyasaponin I is the most abundant saponin in
the M. truncatula hairy roots extract. This is consistent with the
previous observation that the major saponins in the roots of M.
truncatula are soyasapogenol conjugates.7 The second most
abundant compound, eluting at 25.80 min, yielded an [M 
H] anion at m/z 825.42987 (C42H66O16, δ ppm = 2.494)
(Figure 3B). In the MS2 spectrum (Figure 3C), the base peak
occurs at m/z 439, a fragment ion resulting from the decarbox-
ylation and dehydration of the medicagenic acid aglycone ion.2
Additional anions were observed at m/z 663, 619, and 601,
correlating to the sequential loss of a hexose (162 Da), a CO2
(44 Da), and a H2O (18 Da) molecule from the parent ion. This
fragmentation pattern corresponded to the previously reported
MS data of 3-Glc-28-Glc-medicagenic acid and 3-Glc-Glc-med-
icagenic acid.2 To annotate the detected compound, we scanned
for other peaks containing an anion with an m/z value between
825.40 and 825.45. Four additional isomers were detected, but
only one (tR 32.15 min) yielded a fragment ion at m/z 439
associated with medicagenic acid. As 3-Glc-28-Glc-medicagenic
acid has been reported to have a lower retention time than 3-Glc-
Glc-medicagenic acid,2 the peak at tR 25.80 min has been
annotated as 3-Glc-28-Glc-medicagenic acid, and the peak at tR
32.15 min as 3-Glc-Glc-medicagenic acid.
Absence of Zanhic Acid Glycosides. A remarkable observa-
tion was the absence of zanhic acid glycosides in the list of
identified saponins. In previous studies, zanhic acid was shown to
be one of the major aglycone moieties in aerial parts of M.
truncatula,8,9 and it was also reported to be present in other M.
truncatula plant tissues, including roots.7 In a more recent study,
however, zanhic acid could not be detected in M. truncatula
roots.27 Similarly, no zanhic acid-containing compounds were
detected in the hairy roots. Hairy root cultures are known to
accumulate secondary metabolites that are normally produced in
“natural” roots of differentiated plants.13,14,28 Hence, the absence
of zanhic acid residues in hairy roots may indicate that this
compound is produced only in the aerial parts of the plant.
Consequently, the occurrence of the enzyme responsible for the
16R-hydroxylation of the saponin backbone (Figure 4) might be
restricted to the aerial parts of the plant. This finding might
further support a tissue-specific role for the saponins in planta.
Indeed, the saponin mixture from the aerial parts of the plant has
a protective effect against herbivores, whereas that from the roots
rather shows allelopathic and antimicrobial activities.29 Thus, the
in vivo role of the zanhic acid glycosides might be related to
antinutritional effects in the aerial parts of the plant. In addition
to zanhic acid glycosides, aerial parts are particularly rich in
medicagenic acid glycosides.79 Notably, none of the major
medicagenic acid glycosides occurring in the aerial parts of the
plant were found in the hairy roots, further underscoring the
unique saponin composition of roots and aerial parts. In root
extracts of greenhouse-grown M. truncatula plants, the presence
of 31 saponins, mainly soyasapogenol conjugates, was shown.7
Here, we could confirm the presence of 18 of these 31 previously
described saponins. For some of the remaining saponins of this
list, we could detect the corresponding nominal masses, but the
observed accurate masses and fragmentation data did not
unambiguously support the proposed structures. Hence, we
did not include them in Table 1. However, in addition to the
18 previously described saponins, 61 other saponins were

encountered in this study, all of which had not been detected
before inM. truncatula. This result underscores the power of the
applied FT-ICR MS platform in metabolome analysis.
Ten Different Aglycones. One prerequisite we applied to
include the detected compounds in the list of tentatively
identified saponins was the occurrence of an aglycone ion in
the MSn fragmentation data. As such, we could show that the
79 identified saponins present in the extract of M. truncatula
hairy roots were glycosides of 10 different aglycones. The
structures of the aglycones are given in Figure 4, and the
observed aglycone ions, their predicted molecular formulas,
and tentative identifications are listed in Table 2. For five of the
aglycones, i.e., hederagenin, bayogenin, medicagenic acid, and
soyasapogenols B and E (Figure 4), saponins containing the
aglycone have been described before.2,79 A sixth aglycone
yielded an [AglyH] ion at m/z 473 (Figure 5A). Although
this aglycone was only detected as a (grand)daughter ion with
nominal m/z values, its molecular formula could be predicted
by the accurate prediction of the molecular formula of the
parent ion and the observed loss of sugar residues. With this
method, the molecular formula was predicted to be C30H50O4,
which corresponds to the molecular formula of soyasapogenol
A. No saponins of M. truncatula that contain soyasapogenol A
as the aglycone had been described, but the compound had
been shown to occur inM. truncatula as a sapogenin.27 Hence,
the two saponins containing this aglycone were tentatively
identified as soyasapogenol A glycosides.
Furthermore, four other, unknown, aglycones were observed.
Aglycone A was shown to occur in 10 of the tentatively identiﬁed
saponins. It had an observed [Agly  H] ion at m/z 485
(Figure 5C), and its molecular formula was calculated to be
C30H46O5. An aglycone with this mass had been previously
observed inM. truncatula, but its structure was not elucidated.2,7,30
Only one sapogenin with this molecular formula is known to
occur in the genus Medicago, namely, 2β,3β-dihydroxy-23-oxo-
olean-12-en-28-oic acid. This aglycone contains a C-23 formyl
group, which is thought to be the biosynthetic intermediate in the
enzymatic oxidation of the C-23 hydroxy group of bayogenin,
eventually leading to the carboxylation of medicagenic acid
(Figure 4).31 Thus, compounds containing aglycone A as the
sapogenin could be 2β,3β-dihydroxy-23-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic
acid glycosides. Another identiﬁed saponin yielded an aglycone
anion atm/z 469 (Figure 5D) and a predicted molecular formula
of C30H46O4 (aglycone B). Similar to aglycone A, this com-
pound may contain a C-23 formyl group and may be
the result of an enzymatic oxidation of hederagenin, leading to
3β-hydroxy-23-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid (Figure 4).
Aglycone C, a third unknown aglycone encountered in one of
the saponins of M. truncatula hairy roots, yielded a ﬁrst product
ion at m/z 437. Similar to medicagenic acid, this ion is the result
of the decarboxylation and dehydration of aglycone C, which has
a calculated molecular formula of C30H44O6. Decarboxylation
and dehydration of aglycones are observed only in medicagenic
acid2 and zanhic acid8 and, thus, could be related to the presence
of a C-23 carboxylic group on the aglycone. Consequently,
we assume that aglycone C contains a C-23 carboxylic group.
Two saponins contain an aglycone (aglycone D) yielding an
anion at m/z 489 (Figure 1C) and a calculated molecular
formula of C30H50O5. No aglycones with this molecular formula
have been described in Medicago to date, but, assuming a
β-amyrin-derived triterpene skeleton, the molecular formula
points toward an aglycone containing ﬁve hydroxy groups. Thus,
we postulate that aglycone D could be an oxidation product of
soyasapogenol A. However, since we cannot postulate a structure
based on these assumptions, we did not include the aglycones C
and D in Figure 3.
’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Generation and Cultivation of Transgenic M. truncatula
Hairy Roots. A. rhizogenes-mediated transformation of M. truncatula
(ecotype Jemalong J5) hairy roots was carried out as reported20 with the
following modifications. After scarification by treatment with sulfuric
acid for 5 min, seeds were surface sterilized with 12% NaOCl during
2 min and washed with sterile H2O. Subsequently, seeds were treated with
1 μM 6-benzylaminopurine for 3 h and thereafter allowed to germinate
on wet, sterile 3 mm Whatman paper at room temperature in the dark.
After 2 days of germination, the seedlings were wounded by cutting
approximately 2 mm from the root tip of the radicle. The wounded
seedlings were infected with A. rhizogenes and placed on slanted agar
plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.8)
supplemented with vitamins (Duchefa). The plates were sealed with
micropore tape and placed vertically. Cocultivation was allowed for
10 days under a 16 h/8 h light/dark regime at 22 C. After 10 days, the
plants were transferred to new plates, containing 100 mg/L cefotaxime
to prevent A. rhizogenes growth, and incubated under identical condi-
tions. After 10 days, hairy roots were excised from the plants and
transferred to liquid MS medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with vitamins,
1% (w/v) sucrose, and 100 mg/L cefotaxime to eliminate A. rhizogenes
contamination. The hairy roots were grown for 7 days in the dark at
24 C and shaking at 300 rpm. Subsequently, the roots were transferred
to horizontal Petri dishes containing solid MS medium (pH 5.8)
supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 100 mg/L cefotaxime and
grown in the dark at 24 C. After 3 weeks, young hairy root tissue was
subcultured to solid medium without antibiotics. For maintenance, the

axenic hairy roots cultures were subcultured every 3 weeks onto fresh
plates. Hairy roots for metabolic profiling were grown for 21 days in
liquid MS medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with vitamins and 1% (w/v)
sucrose.
Metabolite Extractions. M. truncatula hairy roots, grown for 21
days in liquid medium, were harvested and rinsed with purified H2O
under vacuum filtration. Subsequently, the roots were frozen and ground
in liquid N2. Of the ground material, 400 mg was extracted with 1 mL of
MeOH at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation for
10 min at 20800g. Under vacuum, 500 μL of the supernatant was
evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 600 μL of H2O/
cyclohexane (2:1, v/v). Samples were centrifuged (10 min at 20800g),
and 200 μL of the aqueous phase was retained for analysis.
LC ESI FT-ICR MS. For reversed-phase LC, an Acquity UPLC BEH
C18 column (150 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm;Waters, Milford, MA) was serially
coupled to an Acquity UPLCBEHC18 column (100 2.1mm, 1.7μm)
and mounted on an ultra-high-performance LC system consisting of a
Accela pump (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) and
Accela autosampler (Thermo Electron Corporation). The Accela LC
system was hyphenated to a LTQ FT Ultra (Thermo Electron
Corporation) via an electrospray ionization source. The following
gradient was run using water/MeCN (99:1, v/v) acidified with 0.1%
(v/v) HOAc (solvent A) and MeCN/water (99:1, v/v) acidified with
0.1% (v/v)HOAc (solvent B): time 0min, 5%B; 30min, 55%B; 35min,
100% B. The loop size, flow, and column temperature were 25 μL,
300 μL/min, and 80 C, respectively. Full loop injection was applied.
Negative ionization was obtained with the following parameter values:
capillary temperature 150 C, sheath gas 25 (arbitrary units), aux. gas 3
(arbitrary units), and spray voltage 4.5 kV. Full FT-MS spectra between
m/z 1201400 were recorded at a resolution of 100 000. For identifica-
tion, full MS spectra were interchanged with a dependent MS2 scan
event in which the most abundant ion in the previous full MS scan was
