A phytochemical study of the ethyl acetate extract of the roots and adventitious roots of Spirotropis longi-
folia, amonodominant tree species of theGuianan rainforest, has allowed the isolation of three compounds:
2-hydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-20 ,20-dimethylpyrano-[50 ,60:4,3]-6a-prenyl-[6aS,11aS]-pterocarpan
(spirotropin A), 2-hydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-20,20-dimethyl-30 ,40-dihydropyrano-[50 ,60:4,3]-6a-prenyl-
[6aS,11aS]-pterocarpan (spirotropin B), and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-diprenyl-20 0 0 0 ,20 0 0 0-dimethylpyrano[50 0 0 0 ,60 0 0 0:
30 ,40]-isoﬂavone (spirotropone). In addition, 10 known compounds, trans-oxyresveratrol, trans-resveratrol,
piceatannol, daidzein, genistein, isoprunetin, lupeol, latifolol, gnetin D and gnetin E, were also isolated.
These compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity and their cytotoxicity, and their structures
were established by 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, CD and optical rotation measurements.

1. Introduction
Spirotropis longifolia (DC) Baill. is a tree whose range extends
from the state of Bolívar (Venezuela) to French Guiana. This is
one of the few species to formmonodominant stands (>50% of indi-
viduals) in tropical rain forests and is also known for its self-cop-
picing ability by the constant rejuvenation of its stems (Fonty
et al., 2011). From a taxonomic point of view, S. longifolia is the
only representative of its genus, which belongs to the tribe of the
Sophoreae (Leguminosae – Papilionoideae). The phytochemistry
of this genus has never been investigated before, and the genus
is not described in terms of plant use or medicinal properties.
In continuation of our search for antifungal compounds from
durable woods (Rodrigues et al., 2010; Royer et al., 2010), ethyl
acetate extracts of roots and adventitious roots of S. longifolia
drew our attention during a screen for antifungal activity. We
therefore embarked upon studying the antifungal constituents
contained in the roots and adventitious roots of this species. In
this article, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation from
NMR spectral data, and antifungal and cytotoxic activities of all
isolated compounds.
2. Results and discussion
Roots and adventitious roots were air-dried and extracted sep-
arately with ethyl acetate. Both extracts were then subjected to
silica gel column chromatography, followed by reverse phase
HPLC to yield three previously unreported (1–3) and 10 known
(4–13) compounds (Fig. 1). In the roots, known compounds were
trans-resveratrol (5) (Yamada et al., 2004), piceatannol (6) (Young
Han et al., 2009), daidzein (7) (Li et al., 2009), genistein (8)
(Kozerski et al., 2003), isoprunetin (9) (Kulesh et al., 2008), and
lupeol (10) (Fotie et al., 2006). In the adventitious roots, com-
pounds isolated were trans-oxyresveratrol (4) (Kanchanapoom
et al., 2002), gnetin E (11) (Boralle et al., 1993), latifolol (12) (Lins
et al., 1982), and gnetin D (13) (Iliya et al., 2002). These known
compounds were identiﬁed by comparison of their analytical data
with those reported in the literature. Compounds 11, 12 and 13
were isolated for the ﬁrst time in the Leguminosae – Papilionoi-
deae family.

The structure of molecules 1 and 2 were determined by 1H and
13C NMR spectroscopy (Table 1). Two distinct groups were ob-
served by analysing the correlations in the COSY, HMBC and HSQC
spectra: a prenyl and a dimethyl-pyrano-pterocarpan.
Compound 1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid. Its molecular
formula was determined as C26H26O6 from the HR-ESI-MS spec-
trum (m/z: 435.1794 [M+H]+). 1H NMR signal at dH 6.71 (1H, s,
H-1) and carbon at dC 117.5 (C-1) as well as correlations of proton
H-1 with C-2 (dC 141.0), C-3 (dC 142.7), C-4a (dC 144.6), C-11a (dC
83.5), and C-11b (dC 112.5), indicated the presence of a pentasub-
stituted aromatic ring. In addition, protons at dH 6.56 (1H, s, H-7)
and 6.34 (1H, s, H-10), respectively, borne by carbon atoms at dC
104.8 (C-7) and 94.1 (C-10), and HMBC correlations of H-7 (dH
6.56) with C-8 (dC 149.1), C-9 (dC 142.9), C-10a (dC 155.2) and C-
6a (dC 48.2) as well as those of H-10 (dH 6.34) with C-10a (dC
155.2), C-6b (dC 122.4), C-8 (dC 149.1) and C-9 (dC 142.9) together
indicated the presence of a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene.
A methylenedioxy moiety with two non-equivalent protons at
dH 5.87 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz, O–CH2–O) and 5.83 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz,
O–CH2–O) was also observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. HMBC cor-
relations of this O–CH2–O group (dH 5.87, dH 5.83) with C-8 (dC
149.1) and C-9 (dC 142.9) indicated that the oxygen atoms were
linked to carbons C-8 and C-9 in the tetrasubstituted aromatic ring
cited above. 1H NMR signals at dH 6.56 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-40),
5.61 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-30) and 1.41 (6H, s, 20-CH3) combined
with 13C NMR signals at dC 117.5 (C-40), 140.4 (C-30), 77.3 (C-20),
and 27.7 (20-CH3), and their HMBC correlations indicated the pres-
ence of a 2,2-dimethyl-pyran ring. HMBC correlations of H-40 (dH
6.56) with C-3 (dC 142.7), C-4 (dC 111.5) and C-4a (dC 144.6) as well
as the chemical shift of carbon atom C-20 at dC 77.3, and the molec-
ular formula of 1 indicated that the 2,2-dimethyl-pyran ring was
fused along the C-3–C-4 bond of the pentasubstituted aromatic
ring. The positions of the 2,2-dimethyl-pyran ring and the methyl-
enedioxy group were further conﬁrmed by comparison of NMR
data described for closely related 2,3-dihydroxy-8,9-methylenedi-
oxy-pterocarpan and 6a-prenyl-pterocarpan (Miyase et al., 1999;
Xiong et al., 2009). Furthermore, 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1)
presented a sequence of characteristic proton signals at dH 2.37
(2H, m, H-10 0), 5.17 (1H, br t, J = 7.4 Hz, H-20 0), 1.66 (3H, br s, H-
40 0), and 1.48 (3H, br s, H-50 0) linked to carbon atoms at dC 31.6

(C-10 0), 119.7 (C-20 0), 135.8 (C-30 0), 25.9 (C-40 0) and 24.0 (C-50 0),
respectively, attributable to a prenyl subunit in 1. Additionally,
1H NMR signals of H-6 protons at dH 3.57 (1H, d, J = 10.7 Hz, H-
6ax) and 3.99 (1H, d, J = 10.7 Hz, H-6eq) borne by carbon atom at
dC 71.3 (C-6) correlated in HMBC spectra with C-6a (dC 48.2), C-
6b (dC 122.4), C-11a (dC 83.5), C-4a (dC 144.6) and C-10 0
(dC 31.6), and a proton at dH 5.04 (1H, s, H-11a) linked to carbon
atom at dC 83.5 (C-11a) and correlated to C-1 (dC 117.5), C-11b
(dC 112.5), C-4a (dC 144.6), C-6 (dC 71.3) and C-6a (dC 48.2) sug-
gested that this prenyl subunit was linked in C-6a to a pterocar-
pan-like compound.
The cis ring junction was established unambiguously by the
observation of NOESY correlations between protons H-10 0 and H-
11a (Fig. 2). Additionally, a positive absorption band at 288.3 nm
(De = 2.92) and a negative one at 327.0 nm (De = 5.42) in the
CD spectrum as well as a very high positive value of the optical
rotation ½a25D + 147.3 (AcOEt, c 0.164) attested of an [6aS, 11aS]
absolute conﬁguration according to literature precedent (Kiss
et al., 2003). Hence, 1 has been identiﬁed as 2-hydroxy-8,9-meth-
ylenedioxy-20,20-dimethylpyrano-[50,60:4,3]-6a-prenyl-[6aS,11aS]-
pterocarpan and was named spirotropin A after the name of the
plant.
Compound 2 was also isolated as a pale yellow solid. Its molec-
ular formula was determined to be C26H28O6 by the analysis of the
HR-ESI-MS spectrum (m/z: 437.1961 [M+H]+). 1H and 13C NMR
spectra of 2 (Table 1) were very similar to those of compound 1.
It was possible to identify the penta- and tetra-substituted aro-
matic rings as well as the prenyl moiety in C-6a, of a pterocarpan
skeleton. The only differences in the NMR signals were protons
H-40 and H-30 and carbon atoms C-40 and C-30 shifted upﬁeld from
dH 6.56 to dH 2.69 for H-40, from dH 5.61 to dH 1.66 for H-30, from dC
117.5 to dC 19.4 for C-40 and from dC 130.4 to dC 43.3 for C-30. Other-
wise, all other signals were nearly identical. However, we observed
the presence of a new gem-dimethyl unit at dH 1.23 (20-CH3), from
which it was clearly established that the 2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyran
ring had been replaced by a 2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran
ring. Again, the absolute conﬁguration in C-6a and C-11a was
ascertained as 6a(S), 11a(S) from the NOESY correlation between
H-11a (dH 5.02) and H-10 0 (dH 2.45), the positive sign of the optical
rotation ½a25D + 107.6 (AcOEt, c 0.054) and the similarity between
the CD spectra of compounds 1 and 2. Hence, 2 was identiﬁed
unambiguously as 2-hydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-20,20-dimethyl-
30,40-dihydropyrano-[50,60:4,3]-6a-prenyl-[6aS,11aS]-pterocarpan
and was named spirotropin B.

Compound 3 was isolated as a pale yellow solid. Its molecular
formula was determined to be C30H32O5 from the HR-ESI-MS spec-
trum (m/z 473.2323 [M+H]+). First, it was established from the
spectral data (Table 2) that signals at dH 7.18 (1H, d, J = 2.15 Hz,
H-20), 7.23 (H, dd, J = 8.4 Hz, J = 2.2 Hz, H-60), and 6.83 (1H, d,
J = 8.4 Hz, H-50) indicated the presence of a 1,2,5-trisubstituted
benzene, while signals at dH 1.45 (6H, s, 20 0 0 0-CH3), 5.63 (1H, d,
J = 9.8 Hz, H-30 0 0 0), and 6.35 (1H, d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-40 0 0 0) were attribut-
able to those of a 2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyran ring. HMBC correlations
of H-40 0 0 0 (dH 6.35) with C-30 (dC 121.8) and C-40 (dC 152.9) as well
as the chemical shifts recorded for C-40 (dC 152.9) and C-20 0 0 0 (dC
76.0) demonstrated that this ring was fused to the 1,2,5-trisubsti-
tuted benzene in positions C-30 and C-40. This connectivity formed
a 2,2-dimethylchromene moiety substituted in C-10 (dC 123.2).
Additionally, an 1H NMR signal at dH 7.90 (1H, s, H-2), correspond-
ing to a proton linked to carbon at dC 152.2 and correlated to C-8a
(dC 153.2) and C-3 (dC 122.9), was typical of an a,b-unsaturated
carbonyl compound linked to an aromatic moiety. These features
are common in the isoﬂavone family.
HMBC correlations of H-2 (dH 7.90) with C-10 (dC 123.2) and of H-
20 (dH 7.18) and H-60 (dH 7.23) with C-2 (dC 152.2) indicated that the
2,2-dimethylchromene was linked by its C-10 to the C-3 in the a,b-
unsaturated ketone. In addition, HMBC correlations of OH-5 (dH
13.20) with C-4a (dC 109.0), C-5 (dC 157.4) and C-6 (dC 105.4) and
those of OH-7 (dH 6.33) with C-6 (dC 105.4), C-7 (dC 159.5), and C-8
(dC 110.0) allowed us to ascertain the presence of a hexasubstituted
benzenic ring, conﬁrming the presence of an isoﬂavone skeleton
substituted at C-3 with a 2,2-dimethylchromene moiety. The high
chemical shift of proton OH-5 (dH 13.20) is attributable to the prox-
imity of the carbonyl group. It should be pointed out as well that 2
prenyl subunits at dH 3.48 (1H, d, J = 6.2 Hz, H-10 0), 5.27 (1H, br t,
J = 7.1 Hz, H-20 0), 1.77 (3H, br s, H-40 0), 1.84 (3H, br s, H-50 0), and dH
3.46 (1H, d, J = 6.2 Hz, H-10 0 0), 5.23 (1H, br t, J = 7.3 Hz, H-20 0 0), 1.74
(3H, br s, H-40 0 0), and 1.83 (3H, br s, H-50 0 0) can be clearly designated
in the NMR data. HMBC correlations of H-10 0 (dH 3.48) with C-5 (dC
157.4), C-6 (dC 105.4), and C-7 (dC 159.5) as well as those of H-10 0 0
(dH 3.46) with C-7 (dC 159.5), C-8 (dC 110.0), and C-8a (dC 153.2) al-
lowed us to determine their positions on the hexasubstituted ben-
zene ring, C-6 and C-8, respectively. Based on this information and
comparison with literature data described for related isoﬂavones
(Russell et al., 1990; Xiong et al., 2009), compound 3was designated
as 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-diprenyl-20 0 0 0,20 0 0 0-dimethylpyrano[50 0 0 0,60 0 0 0:
30,40]-isoﬂavone and was named spirotropone.
All compounds isolated were tested for their antifungal activity
by microdilution, most of them over 6 strains of dermatophyte

fungi and 8 pathogenic yeasts. The antifungal activities were com-
pared to those of positive standards itraconazole and ﬂuconazole.
Active compounds (MIC 6 64 lg/mL) were also tested towards
MRC5 normal lung tissue cells and MDA-MB-435 metastatic mela-
noma cells to evaluate their antifungal selectivity. Meanwhile,
inactive compounds were tested against KB human cervical carci-
noma cells to evaluate their hypothetical cytotoxicity.
Of all the compounds tested, only 6, 11 and 12 showed strong
antifungal activity, particularly in yeast growth inhibition. Com-
pound 6 showed the best activity against Candida parapsilosis LMGO
05 (MIC = 1.0 lg/mL), and compound 12was able to inhibit Candida
albicansATCC10231, Candida parapsilosis LMGO05 and Candida kru-
sei LMGO174 at a concentration of 2.0 lg/mL.Moreover, compound
12 showed very high anti-yeast selectivities with index values of
62.8 when measured with MRC5 cells and 32 with MDA-MB-435
cells. In addition, the general anti-yeast activity of compound 6
was particularly interesting, with selectivities >16 with MRC5 cells
and ranging from 32 to 103 with MDA-MB-435 cells.
On dermatophytes, the best antifungal activities were observed
with gnetin E (11), which inhibited the growth of Trichophyton ru-
brum LMGO 06 and Microsporum gypseum LMGO 10 at 2.0 lg/mL,
with a selectivity index of 13 in MRC5 cells and 31 in MDA-MB-
435 cells. Fluconazole inhibited the growth of the latter compound
at 32 lg/mL. Considering the previously unreported compounds,
spirotropin A (1) presented a weak antiproliferative activity on
KB cells with 56% inhibition at 105 M.
3. Concluding remarks
In conclusion, we have isolated and fully characterised three
previously unreported prenylated isoﬂavonoids (1–3) and three
compounds that had never been isolated in the Leguminosae –
Papilionoideae subfamily (11–13) as well as seven others typical
from this subfamily. All compounds except 10 derived from the
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway mixed with subsequent
addition of several malonyl-CoA (Du et al., 2010) and were gener-
ally known to be phytoalexins or precursors of phytoalexins (Dixon
and Ferreira, 2002; Lozovaya et al., 2007; Yamada et al., 2004). We
demonstrated that several of these compounds were capable of
inhibiting the growth of human pathogenic fungi and were pre-
sumably synthesised by the tree for protection against fungi-med-
iated degradation (Lozovaya et al., 2004; Naoumkina et al., 2007).
Torti et al. (2001) pointed out that monodominance is only al-
lowed by an assemblage of plant traits, not any single one. Our
observations may account for the natural durability and mono-
dominance of S. longifolia (Fonty et al., 2011) and suggest that
chemical defenses are among the plant traits allowing it. In addi-
tion, good antifungal activities and low cytotoxicities of piceatan-
nol (6) and latifolol (12) indicated that these substances could
inspire the search of new antifungal agents for the treatment of
mycoses. Our study represents the ﬁrst chemical description of
the Spirotropis genus and enriches chemotaxonomic information
regarding the Leguminosae – Papilionoideae subfamily.
4. Experimental
4.1. General
The optical rotations were measured on an Anton Paar MCP 300
polarimeter, and the chiroptical properties were determined with a
Jasco J-810 CD spectrometer. The UV spectra were recorded with a
Varian CARY 100 apparatus. The infrared spectra were recorded
with a FT-IR Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 system, and melting
points were measured with a Büchi B-540 apparatus. Melting
points were not corrected. Column chromatography was con-
ducted with silica gel Merck 60 (0.063–0.2 mm). Eluting solvents
were hexane and ethyl acetate (VWR extraction grade), both dis-
tilled before use, as well as methanol (VWR, analytical grade). Nu-
clear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a
Varian 400MR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm Auto X PGF
1H/15N-31P inverse detection probe. NMR spectra were recorded
at 400 MHz for 1H and at 100.6 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts (d)
are in ppm downﬁeld from tetramethylsilane, and coupling con-
stants are in Hz. The s stands for singlet, d for doublet, t for triplet,
and br for broad.
HR-ESI-MS measurements were carried out on a quadrupole-
time-of-ﬂight instrument (UltrOTOF-Q, BrukerDaltonics, Billerica,
MA). Analytical HPLC was performed on a Supelco Discovery C18
column (150  4.6 mm,5 lm)using aWaters systemequippedwith
aW600 pump, aW2996 photodiode array absorbance detector, and
aW2420 evaporative light scattering detector. The ﬂow ratewas set
to 1 mL/min using a linear gradient of water mixedwith an increas-
ing proportion of acetonitrile. Separations were performed on a
Supelco Discovery C18 column (150  21.2 mm, 5 lm) using a
Waters system equipped with a W600 pump and a W2487 dual
wavelength UV detector. The samples were injected manually
through a Rheodyne injector at a ﬂow rate of 15 mL/min, and the
efﬂuents were monitored at 214 and 254 nm. Analytical TLC plates
(Si gel 60 F 254) were purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc (France).
4.2. Plant material
Roots and adventitious roots were collected at PK18 Piste de
Saint-Elie, Sinnamary, French Guiana. Identiﬁcation was performed
at the Cayenne herbarium, where a voucher has been deposited
(CAY VE137).
4.3. Extraction and isolation
S. longifolia roots were dried, ﬁnely ground (1700 g) and ex-
tracted with ethyl acetate (3  3 L) at room temperature for 24 h.
The organic layers were collected by ﬁltration and combined and
evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude ethyl acetate
extract (29.1 g). A portion of this extract (10.0 g) was partitioned in
10 fractions (F01–F10) by column chromatography with a polarity
gradient of hexane–CH2Cl2–AcOEt–EtOH. Fractions were tested on
C. albicans ATCC 10231, and the most active fraction, F-05 (1.2 g),
was further separated in 15 sub-fractions F05/01 to F05/15 by col-
umn chromatography using a gradient of hexane–ethyl acetate. At
this stage, lupeol (10, 85.0 mg, 146 ppm) was isolated in pure form.
Sub-fractions F05/02 (56.0 mg) and F05/07 (53.0 mg) were puriﬁed
by reverse-phase semi-preparative HPLC to give spirotropin A (1,
2.3 mg, 3.9 ppm) and spirotropone (3, 1.0 mg, 1.7 ppm). Fraction
F06 was also puriﬁed by RP-HPLC to yield spirotropin B (2,
3.0 mg, 5.1 ppm), trans-resveratrol (5, 3.0 mg, 5.1 ppm), piceatan-
nol (6, 8.0 mg, 13.7 ppm), daidzein (7, 1.0 mg, 1.7 ppm), genistein
(8, 1.0 mg, 1.7 ppm), and isoprunetin (9, 5.5 mg, 9.4 ppm).
Adventitious roots of S. longifolia were dried, ﬁnely ground
(85.0 g) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3  400 mL) at room
temperature for 24 h per extraction. After ﬁltration, the combined
ethyl acetate fractions were evaporated to dryness (2.7 g). A por-
tion of this crude extract (250 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC, allow-
ing for the isolation of trans-oxyresveratrol (4, 1.5 mg, 0.019%),
gnetin E (11, 1.7 mg, 0.022%), latifolol (12, 8.0 mg, 0.10%) and gne-
tin D (13, 1.5 mg, 0.019%).

4.7. Microorganisms and media
The species of human pathogenic microorganisms used in this
study were ﬁlamentous dermatophytes M. gypseum LMGO 10,
Microsporum canis (LMGO 25 and LMGO 22), T. rubrum (LMGO 06
and LMGO 08), and Trichophyton mentagrophytes LMGO 09. Yeast
species were C. albicans (ATCC 10231 and LMGO 102), C. parapsilo-
sis (ATCC 22019 and LMGO 05), Candida glabrata LMGO 44, C. krusei
LMGO 174, Candida tropicalis LMGO 35 and Cryptococcus gattii
LMGO L1. LMGO (Laboratório de Micologia de Goiás) strains were
clinical isolates from patients at the Federal University of Goiás
Hospital. Strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar. All
strains were cultured onto a new agar plate and incubated at
28 C for 2 days (yeast) or 5 days (ﬁlamentous fungi) prior to any
antimicrobial test.
The strains used in cytotoxicity assays were KB cervical carci-
noma cells, MRC5 normal lung tissue cells and MDA-MB-435 met-
astatic melanoma cells provided by the Ciblothèque Cellulaire of the
Institute (ICSN, Gif-sur-Yvette, France).
4.8. Antifungal susceptibility assay by microdilution
The standard microdilution test described by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines M27-A3 and M38-A2
was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
against dermatophyte fungi and yeast (CLSI, 2008a,b; Melo e Silva
et al., 2009). Pure compounds were tested at concentrations rang-
ing from 64 to 0.125 lg/mL. Fluconazole and itraconazole (Sigma)
were used as positive controls and tested at concentrations of 64–
0.125 lg/mL and 16–0.031 lg/mL, respectively. The microplates
were incubated at 32 C, and the results were observed after 5 days
for ﬁlamentous fungi and 2 days for yeast. The MIC values reported
in Table 3 refer to the lowest concentration preventing visible
growth in the wells. All assays were conducted in triplicate.
4.9. Cytotoxicity evaluation on mammalian cells
The cytotoxic effect on MRC5, KB and MDA-MB-435 cells was
monitored at the Laboratoire de Cultures Cellulaires, ICSN, Gif-sur-
Yvette, France (Tempete et al., 1995). On KB cells, the percentage
of cell growth inhibition was measured at a concentration of
105 M and read after 72 h incubation. The compounds presenting
antifungal activity (MIC 6 64 lg/mL) were tested against MRC5
and MDA-MB-435 cells at concentrations of 128–0.25 lg/mL and
read after 24 h incubation, allowing us to calculate their IC50 values
and to evaluate their antifungal selectivity (IC50/MIC). Docetaxel
(Sigma) was used as a positive control and tested at concentrations
of 128–0.25 lg/mL against MRC5 and MDA-MB-435 cells as well as
at 105 M against KB cells.
