In this trial we studied the influences of the ripeningstage at harvest (mature-ripe or green-ripe) on quality of ready to eat mango fruits from nine cultivars (Carrie,Keitt, Glenn, Manzanillo, Maya, Rosa, Osteen, Tommy Atkins and Kensington Pride) grown in the Mediterraneansubtropical climate through physicochemical, nutraceutical, and sensory analysis. Our results show a largevariability among the different observed genotypes and in dependence of the ripening stage at harvest. With theexception of Rosa, mature-ripe fruits are well-colored, sweet and aromatic, and better suited for short supplychains. On the other hand, post-harvest ripened fruits are firmer, frequently (Carrie, Glenn, Keitt, Manzanillo,Maya) possess interesting nutraceutical value and, in the case of Glenn, Maya, Osteen, and Kensington Pride, theycan reach market standard quality.1. IntroductionMango (Mangifera indica L. Family Anacardiaceae) is the most dif-fused fruit crop in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It iscultivated on an area of approximately 3.7million ha worldwide withover 1000 cultivars (CVs). Its production is concentrated in tropical,subtropical and, more recently, in the Mediterranean area. Along thecoastal areas of Sicily, characterized by a mild climate, mango culti-vation is increasing and, in the last decade, several international CVswere introduced (Farina, D’Asaro, Mazzaglia, Gianguzzi, & Palazzolo,2017a).Fruit quality attributes, such as color, aroma, flavor, taste, andtexture, are of great commercial importance (Farina, Gianguzzi,D’Asaro, Mazzaglia, & Palazzolo, 2017b). On the other hand, due to theincreasing consumer interest in health-promoting properties of food,also aspects related to nutraceutical value contribute to define fruitquality. Mango fruit is a rich source of phytochemicals (López-Coboet al., 2017; Pott, Marx, Neidhart, Mühlbauer, & Carle, 2003; Ribeiro,Barbosa, Queiroz, Knödler, & Schieber, 2008) and it has been includedin the top ten of the fruits with the highest radical scavenging activity(Ali, Devi, Nayan, Chanu, & Ralte, 2010). Commercial attributes ofmango fruit are strongly dependent on genotype, climatic factors(Ribeir et al., 2008; Rocha Ribeiro et al., 2007) and storage conditions(Farina et al., 2017c). Moreover, mango quality is also influenced byripening stage at harvest and after storage (Wanitchang,Terdwongworakul, Wanitchang, & Nakawajana, 2011). Mango is aclimacteric fruit with a very short shelf life due to its rapid ripenessafter harvest. Usually, fruits from tropical countries and direct to theEuropean market are collected precociously, before complete ripening,at mature-green stage, when they are hard and green, and then areripen progressively after harvest. This practice improves storability andtransportability but generally produces fruits lacking developed char-acteristic color, aroma and taste. On the other hand, fruits sent to localmarkets, and eventually air-shipped, can also be harvested at mature-ripe stage, and generally have the best quality. Even though data aboutfruit quality of mango can be found in the literature, a comparisonhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.109Received 27 July 2018; Received in revised form 21 October 2018; Accepted 22 October 2018⁎ Corresponding author.E-mail address: carla.gentile@unipa.it (C.

All rights reserved.Tbetween ripening on tree and after harvest had not been studied.Moreover, although studies were performed in the main tropical andsubtropical environments (Liu et al., 2013; Mirellys et al., 2015), re-search is deficient in Mediterranean subtropical climate. In particular,until now, little reports are available on chemical composition andsensory parameters of several varieties recently introduced and grownin Sicily (Farina et al., 2017a). The aim of this trial is to understand theinfluence of the ripening on the tree or after harvest on the physico-chemical, nutraceutical and sensory characteristics of mango fruitsfrom nine CVs grown in the Mediterranean subtropical climate of Sicily.The secondary objective of the trial is to classify these different kinds ofmango fruits based on their quality attributes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialThe trial was carried out in the experimental orchard of the CupiturFarm located in Acquedolci, province of Messina (Sicily, Italy; 38°3′N,14°33′ E; 5m a.s.l.) in 2015. Nine CVs of mango were studied: Carrie,Keitt, Glenn, Manzanillo, Maya, Rosa, Osteen, Tommy Atkins andKensington Pride (Supporting Information: SUPP1). Six uniform 11-year-old trees, grafted on Gomera-3 rootstock, trained to a globe shape, wereselected for each cultivar (CV). The trees were planted in single rows(north–south oriented), spaced 5×4m and submitted to the organicfarming techniques. A sample of 30 fruits per CV (5 fruits× 6 tree)were hand-picked at mature-green stage. Changes in fruit shape, fromoval to round, depending on the CV, were used as maturity index ac-cording to Galan-Sauco (Galan Sauco, 2009). Another sample of 30fruits (5 fruits× 6 tree×CV) were hand-picked at mature-ripe (MATfruits) stage. MAT fruits are ready for harvesting when the upper edgesof the fruit slightly overhang the point of insertion of the stalk. More-over, in some observed CV, such as Tommy Atkins, skin color evolutionfrom dark-green to light-green to yellow was used too as harvestingcriteria (Galan Sauco & Fernandez Galvan, 1990; Galan Sauco, 2009;Kader & Mitcham, 2008). Twenty of these fruits were used for physi-cochemical and sensory analysis, while the other ten fruits were wa-shed, peeled, and the pulp immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen andthen stored at −80 °C and used for nutraceutical evaluation within3months. While MAT fruits were collected and immediately evaluatedor frozen, those harvested at mature-green were before stored at roomtemperature (25 °C) until they were reached ready to eat maturation for4–8 days (GRN fruits) and then were submitted to analysis or werefrozen.2.2. Standard and chemicalsAscorbic acid (AA), [2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid)] diammonium salt (ABTS), 2,2′-azobis (2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride (ABAP), 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Folin-Ciocalteau’s reagent, Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS),6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), po-tassium persulfate, and phenolic standards (apigenin, benzoic acid,caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, luteolin, mangiferin, protocatechuic acid, syr-ingic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich(Gillingham, UK). β-Carotene was obtained from Extrasynthese (Genay,France). Acetonitrile, acetone and methanol (LC–MS grade) were pur-chased from Biosolve B.V. (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands) and aceticand formic acid from VWR International B.V. (Roden, TheNetherlands). RPMI, fetal bovine serum (FBS), phosphate bufferedsaline (PBS), L-glutamine solution (200mM), trypsin-EDTA solution(170,000 U/l trypsin and 0.2 g/l EDTA) and penicillin-streptomycinsolution (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10mg/mL streptomycin) werepurchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium). All other materials andsolvents were of analytical grade unless indicated otherwise.2.3. Physiochemical analysesFruit weight, longitudinal diameter, transversal diameter, seedweight, peel weight, flesh weight, flesh firmness (FF), total solublesolids content (TSS), and titratable acidity (TA), were analyzed. Theweight of fruit, seeds, peel and flesh (g) were determined by a digitalscale (Gibertini EU-C 2002 RS, Novate Milanese, Italy); the longitudinaland transversal diameter (mm) by digital caliper TR53307 (Turoni,Forlì, Italy); FF (kg cm−2) by digital penetrometer TR5325 with a 8mmdiameter tip (Turoni, Forlì, Italy); TSS (°Brix) by digital refractometerAtago Palette PR-32 (Atago Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and TA (g citricacid/L) using a CrisonS compact tritator (Crison Instruments, SA,Barcelona, Spain).2.4. Vitamin C contentThe Vitamin C content (VC) was determined by HPLC-DAD withspectrophotometric detection at 266 nm. The liquid chromatographicsystem was equipped with an injector Model 77-25 (Rheodyne, Berkely,CA) with a 100 μL injector loop, a photodiode detector, and a 5 μmChromsep C18 column (250mm×4.6mm i.d.) and a similarly packedpre-column (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The elution was performed with abuffer solution consisting of KH2PO4/H3PO4 at pH 2.3 and at a flow rateof 1.2mLmin−1. Three aliquots of a homogenate, obtained fromthawed flesh of three fruits for each CV and for each series, GRN orMAT, where analyzed. Five g of fruit flesh homogenate were added to25mL of 3% metaphosphoric acid, centrifuged, filtered through aMillex HV 0.45 μm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and injected inHPLC. The concentration of vitamin C was calculated from the ex-perimental peak area by analytical interpolation in a standard cali-bration curve, and VC was expressed as mg AA per 100 g per fresh fleshweight (FW). All measurements were done in three replicates.2.5. Total carotenoid contentThe total carotenoid content (TCC) was determined by spectro-photometric analysis after preliminary carotenoids extraction as pre-viously reported (Gentile et al, 2016). All procedures were carried outon ice and under dim light as much as possible. Three aliquot of fruitsflesh (ca. 5 g per aliquot) were analyzed. Each aliquot, obtained from 3fruits for each CV and for each series MAT or GRN, previously ground toa fine powder under liquid nitrogen, was mixed for 20min with 50mLof extracting solvent (hexane/acetone/ethanol, 50:25:25, v/v/v). Theorganic phase containing carotenoids was recovered and then used foranalyses after suitable dilution with hexane. Visible spectra were col-lected and TCC was evaluated by the absorbance at 450 nm. TCC wascalculated according to the method of Ritter and Purcell (Bauernfeind,1981) using an molar extinction coefficient of β-carotene of 2505 andwas expressed as μg β-carotene per g FW. All measurements were donein three replicates.2.6. Preparation of the fruit extractsThe fruits were thawed, peeled and the seed was removed. The pulpwas finely chopped and weighed. Three different samples of a homo-genate of three fruits for each series, GRN or MAT, were analyzed foreach CV. Five g of flesh homogenate was extracted for two times with5mL ethanol. After a cleanup step via centrifugation (10min at10,000g, 4 °C) and filtration through a Millex HV 0.45 μm filter(Millipore, Billerica, MA), the supernatants were recovered, combinedand used for the analysis detailed in the following sections.2.7. Total phenolic contentThe total phenolic content (TPC) of ethanolic extracts was de-termined by the reduction of phosphotungstic-phosphomolybdic acidC. Gentile et al. Food Chemistry 277 (2019) 471–479472(Folin-Ciocalteau’s reagent) to blue pigments, in alkaline solution ac-cording to Folin and Denis (Singleton & Rossi, 1965). Quantificationwas performed by gallic acid (GA) calibration curve, and the resultswere expressed as mg GA equivalents (GAE) per 100 g FW. All mea-surements were done in three replicates.2.8. Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds by UHPLC-HESI-MS/MSPolyphenolic profile of ethanolic extracts was performed by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The analysis was con-ducted using Dionex UltiMate®3000 Rapid Separation LC system(Thermo Fischer Scientific, San Jose, CA), with an auto-sampler con-trolled by Chromeleon 7.2 Software (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, DE andDionex Softron GmbH, Germering, DE). The column was a PhenomenexLuna C18(2) 50× 1mm, packed with core–shell particles of 2.5 µ. Theflow rate was set at 50 µLmin−1 at 20 °C and the total chromatographicanalysis time was 22min. The eluent A was water with 0.1% formicacid (v/v) pH 3.2, and eluent B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid(v/v). The elution was performed according to the following method:0–10min 5% B; 10–13min linear increase to 95% B; 13–20min hold95% B; 21min linear decrease 5% B and 22min coming back to theinitial conditions. The UHPLC was coupled to a quadrupole Orbitrapmass spectrometer (Q Exactive) (Thermo Scientific, Germany),equipped with heated electrospray ion source (HESI). For the identifi-cation of phenolic compounds negative ionization mode was used (DiStefano et al., 2012). The HESI parameters were: auxiliary gas unit flowrate 4 arbitrary units; sheath gas flow rate 35 arbitrary units, capillarytemperature 250 °C; spray voltage 3.5 kV; auxiliary gas heater tem-perature 150 °C and S lens RF level 30. The MS was operated in elec-trospray negative, the analyses were conducted in two acquisitionmodes: Full-Scan, for untargeted analysis, and Selected Ion Monitoring(SIM) for quantification of the selected compounds. The resolutionpower in full scan was 35,000 FWHM (at m/z 200) and the scan rangechosen was 100–1000m/z. The automatic gain control (AGC) targetwas set at 1E5 for a maximum capacity in C-trap and maximum in-jection time at 200ms. Scan-rate was set at 2 scans s−1. For SIM ac-quisition mode, the analysis was performed using a mass inclusion listand retention times of the singular target phenolic compounds(Supporting Information: SUPP2). The resolving power was 35,000FWHM (at 200). Using this scan mode, precursor ions were filtered bythe quadrupole with a 1m/z isolation window and the maximum in-jection time was 100ms. Data were analyzed with Qual Browser Xca-libur 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and identification of individualphenolic was supported by retention times, exact mass spectral data.Quantification was performed by linear regression using an externalcalibration curves, injecting each phenolic standard suspended in 80:20MetOH/H2O (v/v). Calibration curves were injected in quadruplicate.2.9. Total antioxidant activityThe total antioxidant activity (TAA) of ethanol extracts was eval-uated using the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay (Miller & Rice-Evans, 1996). ABTS%+ was prepared by reacting of ABTS with po-tassium persulfate (Re et al., 1999). Samples were analyzed at fivedifferent dilutions, within the linearity range of the assay. TAA wasexpressed as μmol Trolox equivalent (TE) per 100 FW. All measure-ments were repeated three times.2.10. Cellular antioxidant activityThe ethanolic extracts was submitted to the Cellular AntioxidantActivity (CAA) assay. For the experiments we used cell line HepG2(hepatocarcinoma cells), obtained from American Type CultureCollection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured inRPMI supplemented with 5% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/mLpenicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin and maintained in a humidifiedatmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were routinely cultured in75 cm2 culture flasks and were trypsinized using trypsin-EDTA whenthe cells reached approximately 80% confluence. CAA assay was per-formed as previously described (Wolfe & Liu, 2007). EtOH concentra-tion in each experiment never exceeded 0.25% and culture mediumwith 0.25% EtOH was used as control. The area under the curve offluorescence versus time was integrated to calculate the CAA value ateach concentration of fruit extract as follows:∫ ∫= − ∗( )CAA SA CA100 100 (1)where: ∫ SA is the integrated area from sample curve; ∫ CA is the in-tegrated area from the control curve. The concentration necessary for50% of diclorofluorescein formation inhibition (CAA50) for each ex-tract or pure GA was calculated from concentration–response (CAA)curves using linear regression analysis. Each result was the mean valueof three separate experiments performed in triplicate.2.11. Sensory analysisThe sensory profile was defined by a panel of 10 judges (4 male and6 female, aged between 25 and 37 y). All panelists were trained and hada broad expertise in sensory evaluation of foods. Panel members weretrained using different samples of mango to recognize the qualitativecharacteristics to be assessed and to generate the attributes. Besides, thejudges were trained on aroma, flavor, textural and mouth feel attributesduring the trained session, using product and ingredient references. Thesamples were evaluated using 10 attributes (Supporting Information:SUPP3). About 50 g of samples was dispensed into a small plastic platewith a 3-digit code on the side and served to judges. The judges eval-uated the intensity of each descriptor by assigning categorical scores of1 (absence of sensation), 2 (just recognizable), 3 (very weak), 4 (weak),5 (slight), 6 (moderate), 7 (intense), 8 (very intense) and 9 (extremelyintense). The study was carried out during three months (from Augustto October). The sample order for each panelist was randomized andwater was provided for rinsing between mango samples.2.12. Statistical analysisAll data were tested for differences between the CVs using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; general linear model) followed byTukey’s multiple range test for P≤ 0.05, whereas Student's-test wasused to determine the difference GRN and MAT fruits. PrincipalComponent Analysis (PCA) was performed by using covariant matrix ofextraction and varimax rotation. All statistical analyses were performedby using the SYSTAT 10 software.3. Results and discussion3.1. Pomological and physico-chemical parametersPhysico-chemical data show a wide variability of the observedcharacteristics. However, the obtained results show how the ripeningstage at harvest affects the final quality of the fruits in all the observedCVs. Concerning pomological parameters (Supporting Information:SUPP4), all observed CVs displayed high quality attributes, and GRNand MAT fruits did not differ significantly. In particular, all the varietiesin question reach a considerable commercial size, with a rather smallincidence of seed and peel on the total fruit weight. The edible partpercentage ranged between 69% (Maya) and 82% (Rosa) of the totalfruit weight. On the other hand, Rosa together toManzanillo and TommyAtkins produced the biggest fruits.At mature-green harvest (GRN fruits at harvest), the fruits of all theobserved CVs were similar in FF (Table 1) that varied in a tight range,from 7.1 kg cm−2 (Gleen) to 9.8 kg cm−2 (Maya). Following theC. Gentile et al. Food Chemistry 277 (2019) 471–479473indication of Lalel, Singh, and Tan (2003), we stored all the mature-green fruits at 25 °C for several days to permit them to reach the finalripening. Generally, MAT fruit were less firm in respect to GRN ones. Inparticular, GRN fruits possess better durability than the correspondingMAT fruits, especially for Osteen, Tommy Atkins, Keitt and KensingtonPride, which correspond to almost all the varietal offer imported fromtropical countries (Table 1).TSS varied largely among the analyzed genotypes, considering bothGRN and MAT fruits (Table 1). In particular, GRN fruits can be groupedin two different subgroup: a group including Carrie, Manzanillo, Mayaand Tommy Atkins always exceeding 15 °Brix, and another group, in-cluding Glenn, Keitt and Kensington Pride, with TSS values that remainedbelow 12.5 °Brix. Similar values were observed by de Cassia MirelaResende Nassur et al. (2015). Excluding Tommy Atkins, TSS values ofMAT fruits were higher than those of the corresponding GRN fruits andranged from 14.4 °Brix (Kensington Pride) to over 18.0 °Brix (Carrie andGlenn).At least, regards TA value, we did not observe significant differencesbetween GRN and MAT fruits or value slightly higher for Keitt,Manzanillo and Osteen MAT fruit compared to GRN ones (Table 1). Justfor Rosa MAT fruits, TA value was three times higher than the corre-sponding GRN fruits. The fruits of all the examined CVs showed TAvalues of less than 7 g/L except Keitt, which reached values of morethan 10 g/L for both GRN and MAT fruits, and Rosa MAT fruits thatexceeded 17 g/L.Our results suggest that MAT fruits could satisfy better the needs ofmarket and consumer. On the other hand, in some cases GRN fruitsreached a quality level similar to the corresponding MAT ones. Inparticular, for Osteen, Tommy Atkins, Manzanillo, and Carrie, earlyharvesting and ripening after picking, made it possible to achievequalitative attributes, in term of TSS and TA, similar to those of theMAT fruits.3.2. Bioactive compoundsThe potential beneficial effects of plant food consumption can beascribed to a number of peculiar bioactive compounds (Gentile,Perrone, Attanzio, Tesoriere, & Livrea, 2015; Naselli et al., 2015). Onthe other hand, phytochemical profile and content of individual phy-tochemicals are deeply influenced by genotype but also ripening stageand storage conditions play an important role (Avellone et al., 2018; DiStefano et al., 2017, 2018; Dragovic-Uzelac, Levaj, Mrkic, Bursac, &Boras, 2007). Studying how these variables affect quality parameters ofthe tropical fruits is especially useful considering their short shelf life.In our results, amounts of carotenoids, vitamin C and polyphenols inanalyzed mango fruits largely varied as a function of genotype and ri-pening stage at harvest, with average values comparable to those pre-viously reported for other mango CVs (Liu et al., 2013; Shivashankara,Isobe, Al-Haq, Takenaka, & Shiina, 2004; Sulaiman & Ooi, 2012).As expected, carotenoid synthesis turned out to be higher duringripening at the tree with light exposure: MAT fruits showed sig-nificantly higher values when compared to the corresponding GRN ones(Table 2). The mean value of TCC in MAT fruits was 23.06 μg per g FWand, among the analyzed genotypes Carrie had the highest TCC, fol-lowed by Kensington Pride and Maya. On the contrary, GRN fruits dis-played very low carotenoid levels, with a mean value of 7.08 μg per gFW.Concerning TPC, there were small differences between GRN andMAT fruits. Only for some CVs, fruits matured on the tree showedhigher TPC than the corresponding GNR ones (Table 2).

Gentile et al. Food Chemistry 277 (2019) 471–479474analyzed genotypes, when considering the MAT fruits, Glenn had thehighest TPC, followed by Carrie and Tommy Atkins. Conversely, for GRNfruits, Carrie was the CV with the highest TPC value, followed by Mayaand Glenn.Concerning VC, among the analyzed genotypes Carrie had thehighest content for both ripening stages (Table 2). With the exception ofOsteen, Rosa and Tommy Atkins, GRN fruits showed higher VC than thecorresponding MAT ones. The content in antioxidant phytochemicalsmay decrease during ripening. This eventuality, already reported inmango fruits (Shivashankara et al., 2004; Sulaiman & Ooi, 2012), canbe related to several processes, including hydrolysis of tannins andincreased polyphenol oxidase activity, that are typical of ripe fruits. Onthe other hand, before our work the effect of maturation of the ripeningstage at harvest on nutraceutical parameters of ready to eat mangofruits have not been evaluated. The higher content in hydrophilic an-tioxidants in GRN fruits compared to the corresponding MAT fruits,which we showed for some of the analyzed CVs, indicates that ripeningafter harvest reduces antioxidant consumption with respect to ripeningat the tree. In agreement with our findings, Shavashankara et al.,showed a higher carotenoid content and a lower hydrophilic anti-oxidant content in MAT mango fruits of Irwin variety than in corre-sponding GRN fruits (Shivashankara et al., 2004). Similar results havebeen reported for other climacteric fruits (Campbell, Merwin, & Padilla-Zakour, 2013). Our results therefore, in agreement with literature data,may indicate that ripening at the tree represent a higher oxidative stresscondition for some CVs than for others. Direct light exposure may ac-count for increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.Polyphenolic profile of the fruit flesh of the observed nine mangoCVs was studied using UHPLC–HESI–MS techniques. In our samples, weidentified and quantify 9 phenolic compounds (Table 3). Although wefound a comparable qualitative profile in the analyzed samples, ourdata showed, in agreement with literature data (López-Cobo et al.,2017; Ribeir et al., 2008), differences in the quantitative profile as afunction of genotype and ripening stage at harvest. Vanillin and benzoicacid were among the most abundant polyphenol compounds in all theCVs in both GRN and MAT fruits. These compounds represented over50% by weight of the total amount of phenolic compounds in allsamples. Mangiferin, a natural C-glucosyl xanthone, with multipledocumented biological activities (Rauf, Imranb, & Patel, 2017), waspresent in all studied samples and in much larger quantities in the pulpof the CVs Manzanillo, Tommy Atkins, Glenn and Osteen, in GRN andMAT fruits, and in Rosa MAT fruits. Considering the effects of ripeningon the evolution of the polyphenolic profile and content, our resultsshowed very limited variations between GRN and MAT fruits. The CVfor which major variations were measured is Glenn. For this CV theMAT fruits have a syringic acid and apigenin content about half of thecorresponding MAT fruits. Considering mangiferin, in Osteen, Rosa andTommy Atkins, the CVs with higher content, this polyphenol was moreconcentrated in MAT fruits than in corresponding GRN fruits. Similarly,benzoic acid content was higher in MAT fruits for Carrie and TommyAtkins and, in contrast, lower in MAT fruits for Manzanillo.The Principal Component Analysis (PCA), calculated on the datamatrices reported in Tables 2 and 3, allowed the discrimination be-tween the CVs, both in GRN and MAT series (Fig. 1). PCA explained49.89% and 25.04% of the total variance for PC1 and PC2 for GRNfruits, meanwhile 38.10% and 21.51% for MAT fruits. Positive factorscores discriminated in GRN series Rosa and Osteen from others CVs fortheir lower content in total polyphenols, VC and p-coumaric acid. Onthe contrary, negative factor scores separated Gleen GRN for the highestcontent of studied phytochemicals. Positive PC1 and negative PC2factor score grouped Keitt, Maya and Carrie for their lower mangiferincontent. In the MAT series, positive factor scores separated Manzanillo,Rosa, Keitt and Osteen from other CVs for their lower TPC and organicacids content, mainly syringic and p-coumaric acid. Negative factorscores allow the discrimination of Gleen MAT fruits for higher TPC andin particular higher mangiferin content. Finally, the high content ofbenzoic acid allows the discrimination of Tommy Atkins and Carrie,meanwhile the lowest caffeic acid content discriminated KensingtonPride and Mawa from other CVs.3.3. Antioxidant propertiesBioactivity of plant chemicals has been related especially to theirantioxidant properties, which are not only useful to prevent oxidativestress phenomena but also influence intracellular redox status bymodulating a number of important redox-dependent cell functions(Gentile et al., 2012; Tesoriere, Allegra, Gentile, & Livrea, 2009). Ourresults showed a significant variability in radical-scavenging potentialof the studied genotypes (Table 4). Regardless of the ripening stage atharvest, high TAA values were recorded for Glenn, Carrie, Maya andKensington Pride. It is hard to compare our results with literature databecause in other studies different methods were used for measuringreducing ability. However, for both GRN and MAT fruits TAA is posi-tively correlated with TPC (p=0.94 and p= 0.99 for GRN and MATfruits, respectively), which is instead comparable to what is reported inliterature for other mango CVs (Shivashankara et al., 2004). In contrast,no significant correlations were observed between TAA and VC. Theseresults indicate that the presence of significant amounts of phenoliccompounds is a major contribution to the antioxidant activity of thesefruits. For Carrie, Gleen, Osteen and Tommy Atkins TAA values of MATfruits were higher than the corresponding GRN fruits. On the contrary,Manzanillo GRN fruits had TAA value higher than the correspondingMAT fruits. In most cases, the observed differences in TAA values be-tween GRN and MAT fruits were consistent with the differences incontent of hydrophilic antioxidants between the two ripening stages atharvest. On the other hand, Keitt andMaya MAT fruits displayed similarTAA values to the corresponding GRN fruits, in spite of the higheramounts of hydrophilic antioxidants in GRN fruits than in MAT ones.Unexpectedly, the antioxidant activity of Carrie, was higher in MATfruits than in the corresponding GRN fruits, despite the latter presenteda significantly higher polyphenolic content. The discrepancies in TAAand TPC values between GRN and MAT fruits observed for some CVscan be explained by the variability of the phytochemical profile amongthe observed CVs and a different ability of antioxidant compounds toreduce the ABTS free radical. In solution assays, although widely usedfor preliminary screening of radical-scavenging and antioxidant activ-ities, are not always useful to make predictions of in vivo antioxidantactivity. Indeed, those methods do not generate biological radicals norevaluate the ability of antioxidants to interact with membranes andtheir stability physiological conditions. Instead, in vitro lipid peroxida-tion assays are very interesting systems to evaluate an antioxidant po-tential with a really physiologically relevance (Wolfe, 2008). For thisreason here we used also the CAA assay to evaluate the antioxidantactivity of ethanolic extracts of the GRN and MAT mango fruits. Theresults are shown in Table 4. Among GRN fruits. the highest antioxidantactivity was reordered for Manzanillo, followed by Maya and Carrie. InMAT series, Rosa followed by Osteen and Manzanillo, displayed thehighest activity. The average of CAA50 values were 46.22mg FW/mLand 46.68mg FW/mL cell medium for MAT and GRN fruit respectively.These values are very close to those determined by Kelly and Wolfe forthe extracts obtained from other fruits (Wolfe, 2008). CAA50 is notcorrelated with TPC or TAA. Positive correlations have not consistentlybeen reported in studies comparing TAA and CAA of plant extracts(Eberhardt, Kobira, Keck, Juvik, & Jeffery, 2005; Wolfe, 2008), con-firming that the antioxidant capacity evaluated in solution assays maynot be predictive of the real antioxidant activity in biological en-vironments. On the other hand, the failure in finding a positive corre-lation between CAA and TPC for the tested fruit extracts suggests thatthe observed differences in the polyphenolic profile and in the singlepolyphenol content of different CVs significantly influence their po-tential bioactivity. Additionally, our results show that CAA variationfrom GRN to MAT fruits for each CV is compatible with theC. Gentile et al.

Food Chemistry 277 (2019) 471–479476corresponding observed changes in TPC, as expected when consideringthat the qualitative polyphenolic profile for ripe fruit of each cultivar isthe same regardless the ripening conditions.3.4. Sensory analysisResults from sensory profile (Table 5), showed that the observedCVs significantly differed also for all the evaluated sensory descriptors.Peel color plays an important role in the perception of overallmango fruit quality (González-Aguilar, Buta, & Wang, 2001). Regard-less of the genotype, the judges considered the MAT fruits more coloredin respect to GRN ones in both skin and flesh. Manzanillo, Maya andGleen showed the best results with the best judgment, and they were theonly CVs that reached good score (very intense) for skin and flesh colordescriptors also in GRN fruits. For all observed genotypes, the acid tastewas more intense in GRN fruit while, on the contrary, MAT fruitreached a sweeter taste. The panelists considered Keitt as the moreacidic CV and Maya and Gleen as the sweeter in both GRN and MATfruits. Regarding sweet descriptor of GNR fruits only Glenn, Maya, Os-teen, and Tommy Atkins reached acceptable score. Sensory data con-firmed chemical determinations: in particular, the best values of TSS/TA ratio were observed in Maya (4.33), Carrie (3.39) for GRN and Os-teen (4.50), Maya (4.22), Carrie (3.96) and Glenn (3.68) for MAT fruits.Keitt showed the lowest values both in GRN (1.03) and in MAT (1.42)fruits.From a consumer point of view, exist a significant correlation be-tween fiber presence and spooning ease (Galan Sauco & FernandezGalvan, 1990) and the low-fiber CVs could be preferred by the con-sumer. Generally, the judge considered MAT fruits with a lower fibercontent respect to corresponding GRN fruits. However, the differencesbetween GRN and MAT were not significantly. Kensington Pride andTommy Atkins showed the highest score for the fiber in the flesh de-scriptor. On the contrary, Carrie GNR fruits and Manzanillo, Osteen, andRosa MAT ones showed the lowest fiber content. MAT fruits was gen-erally juicier than GRN ones. Only Maya, Osteen and Tommy Atkins GRNfruits showed for the juiciness descriptor an acceptable score. Malundoet al. founded a positive relation between the level of juiciness in mangofruits and the flavor perception (Malundo, Shewfelt, Ware, & Baldwin,2001). Our data confirmed this tendency. According with a higherjuiciness, MAT fruits showed higher scores of exotic fruit and peachflavor and odor descriptor than the corresponding GNR fruits. More-over, the juiciest CVs Glenn, Maya and Osteen presented the highestscores of exotic fruit flavor descriptors, both for GRN and MAT fruit.Maya also showed the best values for peach odor descriptor in bothGNR and MAT fruits.4. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the demonstrated sensorial and pomological attri-butes, together to interesting nutraceutical value of the analyzed fruits,indicated a real possibility to reach high quality fruits in theMediterranean climate. However, our results showed a great variabilityalso among the CVs.In order to develop more appreciable and healthy products in a veryFig. 1.

MAT fruits showed high pomological and sensorial traitsand are better suited for short supply chains; meanwhile fruits har-vested at commercial ripening and matured after harvest, are firmerand consequently can stand long storage and shipping. On the otherhand, GRN fruits frequently achieve higher nutraceutical value and, in acultivar-dependent manner, can reach pomological and sensory char-acteristics close to those of corresponding MAT fruits, and compatiblewith the market demand and consumer taste. Overall, the obtained datacontribute to define the commercial potential of the analyzed genotypesand to identify the most suitable fruits to be ripened after harvest andthen the best market for each CV.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge Pietro Cuccio, owner of Cupitur s. r. l., forthe technical support and for its kind hospitality.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Appendix A.
