Abstract New benzophenone and ﬂavonol galloyl gly-
cosides were isolated from an 80% MeOH extract of
Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) together with ﬁve known
quercetin glycosides. The structures of the novel glycosides
were elucidated to be 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone 4-O-
(600-O-galloyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (1, guavinoside A),
2,4,6-trihydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzophenone 4-O-(600-O-
galloyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (2, guavinoside B), and
quercetin 3-O-(500-O-galloyl)-a-L-arabinofuranoside (3,
guavinoside C) by NMR, MS, UV, and IR spectroscopies.
Isolated phenolic glycosides showed signiﬁcant inhibitory
activities against histamine release from rat peritoneal mast
cells, and nitric oxide production from a murine macro-
phage-like cell line, RAW 264.7.

Introduction
Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae) is a small medicinal tree that
is native to South America. All parts of this tree, including
fruits, leaves, bark, and roots, have been used for treating
stomachache and diarrhea in many countries. Previous
studies of this plant have led to the isolation of tannins
[1, 2], tannins and other phenolic compounds [3], ﬂavonol
glycosides [4, 5], triterpenoids [6], terpenoids [7], and
carotenoids [8]. It is well known that an extract of the
leaves of P. guajava improves symptoms of allergic dis-
ease, and we are interested in small molecules from the
leaves of P. guajava, other than tannins, and their potential
anti-inﬂammatory activities.
In this investigation, two new benzophenone galloyl
glycosides, guavinosides A (1) and B (2), and a quercetin
galloyl glycoside, guavinoside C (3), were isolated from
the leaves of P. guajava together with known quercetin
glycosides (4–8). These structures of the novel glycosides
were established through detailed analysis of their spec-
troscopic data and chemical evidence, and their inhibitory
activities against histamine release from rat mast cells and
nitric oxide (NO) from RAW 264.7 were also determined.
Results and discussion
Guavinoside A (1) was obtained as a yellow powder. The
positive ion mode FAB-MS of 1 showed a quasimolecular
ion peak at m/z 545 [M ? H]
?, and the molecular formula
was determined to be C26H24O13 based on its high-reso-
lution (HR)-FAB-MS (found 545.8418, calcd. 545.8413 for
C26H25O13). In the IR spectrum, the strong absorbance at
1,700 cm
-1 indicated the presence of conjugated carbonyl
groups in 1. Acid hydrolysis of 1 furnished D-glucose
which was identical with HPLC analysis, using an optical
rotation (OR) detector. In the
1H-NMR spectrum of 1, two
aromatic signals at dH 6.11 (2H, s) and 6.98, (2H, s)
indicated the presence of two 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted
phenyl groups, and the spin system of dH 7.68 (2H, dd,
J = 7.0, 1.0 Hz), 7.46 (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz), and 7.57 (1H, t,

DOI 10.1007/s11418-010-0400-2J = 7.0 Hz) showed the presence of a phenyl group.
Additionally, an anomeric proton signal at dH 4.86 (1H, d,
J = 7.6 Hz) indicated that the glucose residue was in the
b-form. Correlations in the
1H–
1H-COSY spectrum were
observed from the anomeric proton to dH 3.15 (1H, m),
3.20 (1H, m), 3.50 (1H, m), 3.30 (1H, m), and 4.39 (2H, br
s) indicating the presence of b-glucose. The signal pattern
in the aromatic region of the
13C-NMR spectrum indicated
the presence of three aromatic rings. In addition, the
13C-
NMR and DEPT spectra showed an anomeric carbon (dC
100.5), four oxymethines (dC 73.0, 76.1, 68.9, and 73.6), an
oxymethylene (dC 62.5), and two carbonyl carbons (dC
165.7 and 195.3). All proton–carbon connectivities
assigned by using HMQC experiments are summarized in
Table 1. The HMBC correlations from 2000,6 000-H (dH 6.98,
2H, s) to C-1000 (dC 119.2), C-3000,5 000 (dC 145.4), C-4000 (dC
138.4), and a carbonyl carbon (dC 165.7) revealed the
presence of a galloyl moiety. A phenyl proton signal at dH
7.68 (2H, dd, J = 7.0, 1.0 Hz, 20,6 0-H) correlated with a
carbonyl carbon signal at dC 195.3, and an aromatic proton
at dH 6.11 (2H, s, 3, 5-H) correlated with C-4 (dC 159.8)
and the carbonyl carbon by weak
4J correlation. Further-
more, the anomeric proton signal correlated with C-4. NOE
enhancement was observed between the anomeric proton
signal and the signal of 3, 5-H. These data suggested that
the aglycone of 1 was 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone, and
a sugar was attached at C-4. The signal of 600-H, however,
was downﬁeld shifted at dH 4.39 (2H, br s), and correlated
with the galloyl carbonyl carbon signal at dC 165.7 in the
HMBC experiment. From these data, the structure of 1 was
established to be 2,4,6-dihydroxybenzophenone 4-O-(600-
O-galloyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (Figs. 1, 2).
Guavinoside B (2) was obtained as a brownish solid.
The negative ion mode FAB-MS of 2 showed quasimo-
lecular ion peak at m/z 571 [M - H]
-, and the molecular
formula was determined to be C28H28O13 based on its HR-
FAB-MS (found 571.1474, calcd. 571.1451 for
C28H27O13). The molecular weight was 28 mass units
(C2H4) greater than that of 1. The
1H- and
13C-NMR
spectra of 2 were very similar to those of 1 except for

123absence of the aromatic methine signal [dH 6.11 (s); dC
94.9] in 1, and a new aryl methyl signal [dH 2.00 (6H, s);
dC 9.9] and a quaternary carbon (dC 110.8) were observed.
In the
13C-NMR spectrum, the appearance of a high-ﬁeld
region shifted methyl signal suggested that the methyl is
linked to a benzene ring in the ortho-position and attached
via an oxygen atom [9]. HMBC correlations were observed
from the methyl proton signal to dC 110.8 (C-3, 5), 151.8
(C-2, 6), and 155.6 (C-4). NOE enhancement was also
observed between the methyls and an anomeric proton at
dH 4.63. These data suggested that the aglycone of 2
was 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzophenone. Absolute
conﬁguration of the glucose moiety was determined to be D
by using HPLC analysis with an OR detector. From the
above data, the structure of 2 was identiﬁed to be 2,4,6-
trihydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzophenone 4-O-(600-O-galloyl)-
b-D-glucopyranoside.
Guavinoside C (3) was obtained as a yellow powder. Its
HR-FAB-MS showed a quasimolecular ion peak at m/z
585.0868, corresponding to the molecular formula
C27H22O15. The UV absorbances at 211, 265, and 355 nm
were characteristic of ﬂavonol. The IR spectrum indicated
the presence of hydroxyl (3,400 cm
-1), ester (1,710 cm
-1),
and conjugated carbonyl group (1,690 cm
-1). In the
1H-
NMR spectrum, meta-coupled signals at dH 6.20 and dH
6.41 and a hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl signal at dH 12.62
indicated the presence of a 5,7-dihydroxy A ring system in
ﬂavonol. A spin system of three aromatic signals at dH 7.46
(1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz), dH 6.85 (1H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), and dH
7.49 (1H, dd, J = 8.8, 2.2 Hz) indicated the presence of a
30,40-dihydroxy B ring system in ﬂavonol. In the
13C-NMR
spectrum, signiﬁcant ﬂavonol signals at dC 157.3 (C-2),
133.0 (C-3), and 177.4 (C-4) were observed. In the HMBC
experiment, the correlations from 20-H to C-2, dC 144.9 (C-
30), 148.3 (C-40), and 121.3 (C-60), from 60-H to C-2, C-40
and dC 115.6 (C-20), and from 50-H to C-30, C-40, and dC
120.8 (C-10) were observed. From these data, the aglycone
of 3 was determined to be quercetin. In addition, an aro-
matic methine (dH 6.89, 2H, s) correlated with dC 118.9 (C-
1000), 108.5 (C-2000,6 000), 145.3 (C-3000,5 000), 138.4 (C-4000),
and 165.4 (carbonyl), indicating the presence of a galloyl
moiety the same as 1 and 2. Acid hydrolysis of 3 with 2 M
HCl afforded (?)-L-arabinose that was identical by HPLC
analysis using OR detector comparison to an authentic
sample of L-arabinose. The small coupling constant of the
anomeric proton (dH 5.56, d, J = 1.4 Hz) indicated the
presence of the a-form of arabinose. Correlations in the
1H–
1H COSY spectrum were observed for a spin system
from the anomeric signal to three oxymethine signals at dH
4.18 (br s, 200-H), 3.81 (m, 300-H), and 3.74 (m, 400-H), and
methylene signals (dH 4.11 and 4.02, 500-H2) was observed.
Furthermore, two hydroxy signals at dH 5.72 (br s) and 5.48
(br s) both coupled with 200-H and 300-H, respectively.
Additionally, the signals of 500-H2 of 3 were shifted
downﬁeld compared with those of 4 (dH 3.36 and 3.32),
and correlated with a galloyl carbonyl carbon signal in the
HMBC experiment. From these observations, the sugar
moiety was determined to be L-a-arabinofuranose. Thus,
the structure of 3 was determined to be quercetin 3-O-(500-
O-galloyl)-a-L-arabinofuranoside.
The structures of 4–8 were elucidated to be quercetin 3-
O-a-L-arabinofuranoside (4), quercetin 3-O-a-L-arabino-
pyranoside (5), quercetin 3-O-b-D-xylopyranoside (6),
quercetin 3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside (7), and quercetin 3-
O-b-D-glucopyranoside (8) by comparison with spectro-
scopic data [10, 11] and chemical degradation methods.
Benzophenone glycosides have been isolated from many
kind of plants, but this is ﬁrst reported isolation of a dim-
ethylbenzophene glycoside from a natural source. The
substitution pattern is the well-known A ring of ﬂavonoid;
a possible biosynthesis pathway to the aglycone moiety of
2 would be methylation of the benzophenone skeleton.
Isolated compounds were evaluated for inhibitory
activities against histamine release from rat peripheral mast
cells [12] and nitric oxide (NO) production from a murine
macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7 cells [13]. Com-
pounds 3–8 (at 100 lg/ml) inhibited histamine release
from mast cells with inhibition ratios of 94.4, 21.9, 30.5,
23.9, 100, and 93.5%, respectively. But 1 and 2 did not
show inhibitory activity against histamine release at this
concentration. Compounds 3–8 (at 100 lg/ml) inhibited

polysaccharide and interferon gamma with inhibition ratios
of 50.0, 33.2, 32.4, 65.1, 55.3, and 52.1%, respectively.
The isolated compounds therefore inhibited chemical
mediators, such as histamine and NO, and increased IL-12
release from RAW 264.7 cells.
In conclusion, phenolic compounds isolated from P.
guajava might be valuable candidates for treating various
inﬂammatory diseases.
Experimental
General
The UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model UV-
160 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a
Horiba FT-210 diffraction infrared spectrometer. FAB-MS
were obtained with a JEOL model JMS-AX505 HA spec-
trometer.
1H-NMR (600 MHz) and
13C-NMR (150 MHz)
spectra were obtained on a Varian Inova
TM 600 spec-
trometer and a JEOL Delta 600 spectrometer. NMR spectra
were measured in DMSO-d6 with TMS as internal stan-
dard. Optical rotation was measured with a Jasco DIP-370
polarimeter. The inhibitory activities against histamine
release from rat mast cells and NO production were carried
out as described in the literature method [14].
Plant material
Leaves of P. guajava were donated by OS Industrial Co.
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).
Extraction and isolation
The dried leaves of P. guajava (5 kg) were extracted with
15 l of 80% MeOH at room temperature for 7 days. The
solution was ﬁltered and concentrated under reduced
pressure to give a crude extract. The extract was dissolved
in water and passed through a Diaion HP-20 column
(Mitsubishi Kasei, Tokyo, Japan), and eluted stepwise with
50, 70, and 100% MeOH. The 70% MeOH eluate was
dissolved in EtOH and passed through a Sephadex LH-20
column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The efﬂuent was
chromatographed on a Diaion CHP-20P column (Mitsubi-
shi Kasei, Tokyo, Japan), and eluted with 50 and 70%
MeOH. All fractions were monitored by TLC, and the
fractions containing the same compound(s) (as evidenced
by TLC) were combined to give four fractions. Fraction 3
(900 mg) was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH 20
column developed with CHCl3–MeOH (1:1) to give four
fractions. Fraction 2 (770 mg) was further applied to a
reversed-phase column (SSC ODS, Senshu Scientiﬁc Co.
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) eluted stepwise with 0–25% MeOH,
and recrystallized from MeOH to give 1 (47 mg). Fraction
4 (124 mg) was puriﬁed by medium pressure liquid chro-
matography (Yamazen Baker-bond ODS Yamazen, Kyoto,
Japan) column eluted with MeCN–MeOH–H2O (5:35:60)
to give 2 (44 mg). Fraction 3 (130 mg) was puriﬁed by
reversed-phase HPLC [column: Shiseido Capcell pak C18
UG120 (10-mm i.d. 9 250 mm, Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan);
mobile phase: MeCN–MeOH–H2O (5:30:65); ﬂow rate:
3.0 ml/min; detection: UV at 254 nm] to give 3 (14 mg).
The 100% MeOH eluate of Diaion HP-20 was dissolved in
MeOH, and chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 col-
umn (2.5 9 100 cm) to give ten fractions. Fraction 3
(1.9 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column
developed with CHCl3–MeOH to give eight fractions.
Fraction 6 (515 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC
[column: Shiseido Capcell pak C18 UG120 (10-mm
i.d. 9 250 mm); mobile phase: MeCN–H2O (18:82); ﬂow
rate: 3.0 ml/min.; detection: UV at 250 nm] to give 4
(20 mg), 5 (50 mg), 6 (62 mg), 7 (62 mg), and 8 (30 mg),
respectively.
