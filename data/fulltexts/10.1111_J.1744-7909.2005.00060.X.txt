Abstract:     To search for new and bioactive minor components from traditional Chinese medicines, a new
compound, named jujuphenoside (1), was isolated from the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge)
Hu. The structure of jujuphenoside was elucidated by spectral and chemical methods, particularly two-
dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Together with the new compound, 22 known compounds
were also isolated and identified from the seeds of Z. jujuba var. spinosa, among which, epiceanothic acid
(2) was first obtained from natural resources, whereas compounds 7–16 were first obtained from this plant.

The seeds of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge)
Hu is used as a traditional Chinese medicine (Chinese
Pharmacopoeia Committee 2000). A series of
dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins (Zeng et al.
1987), triterpenoids (Zeng et al. 1986), flavonoids
(Cheng et al. 2000), and alkaloids (Yin et al. 1997)
have been isolated previously from this genus. In the
search for new and bioactive minor components from
traditional Chinese medicines, we have investigated the
seeds of Z. jujuba var. spinosa collected in Xingtai,
Hebei Province, China. In the present paper, we report
on the isolation and elucidation of the structure of a
new phenyl glycoside, namely jujuphenoside (1;
Fig. 1), along with 22 known compounds: epiceanothic
acid (2; Eade et al. 1971); betulinic acid (3); β-sito-
sterol (4); daucosterol (5); betulin (6; Mu et al. 1996);
alismoxide (7; Peng et al. 2003); 5, 6, 7, 8, 3′, 4′-
hexamethoxy flavone (8; Werner and Palaniappan
1982); glycitin (9; Xu et al. 2003); genistin (10; Zhang
et al. 2002); daidzin (11; Zhang et al. 2002); hesperidin
(12; Guo et al. 2000); clematine (13; Chen et al. 1993);
azukisaponin II  (14 ;  Kitagawa et al .  1983);
soyasapogenol B-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-
glucopyranosyl(1→2)-β-glucurono-pyranoside (15;
Kang et al. 1998); soyasapogenol B-3-O-α-L-
rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranosyl(1→4)-β-
D-glucuronopyranoside (16; Sun et al. 1987); juzirine
(17; Yin et al. 1997), 6′′′-feruloylspinosin (18; Cheng
et al. 2000); 6′′′-feruloylisospinosin (19; Cheng et al.
2000); isospinosin (20; Cheng et al. 2000); spinosin
(21; Cheng et al. 2000); jujuboside A (22; Zeng et al.

the known compounds, compound 2 was first isolated
from natural resources and compounds 7–16 were first
obtained from this plant. Some of these compounds
exhibit significant pharmacological activities (Zhou et
al. 2003).
1    Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was obtained as white amorphous
powder. Its molecular formula, C14H16O8, was con-
firmed by HRESI-MS ([M+H]+ m/z: 313.096 2, calcu-
lated 313.091 8). The IR spectrum indicated the pres-
ence of hydroxyl groups, an ester carbonyl group and
an aromatic ring. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed one
methoxyl group at δ 3.80 (3H, s) and one 1, 2,

4-trisubstituted benzene ring, which was confirmed by
one ABX system at δ 7.77 (1H, dd,  J = 8.6, 1.7 Hz), 7.42
(1H, d, J = 1.7 Hz), and 7.40 (1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz).
Moreover, seven sugar proton resonances in the re-
gion δ 3.20–5.26, including one anomeric proton reso-
nance at δ 5.26 (d, J = 7.2 Hz) were also observed.
These data suggested that compound 1 was a phenyl
glycoside. Hydrolysis of compound 1 afforded
isovanillic acid and glucose, which were determined
by comparison of co-TLC with authentic samples. The
configuration of C-1′ was determined to be β oriented,
as judged by the coupling constant of H-1′. The 13C-
NMR spectrum revealed 14 carbon signals, correspond-
ing to one phenyl skeleton, one glucose moiety, one
methoxyl group, and one conjugated ester carbonyl
group. Comparison of the 13C-NMR data of the sugar
moiety of compound 1 with those of methyl β-D-
glucopyranoside revealed that C-6′ was significantly
shifted downfield to δ 65.6. This suggested that the
isovanillic acid moiety was attached to C-6′ of the
glucosyl unit and this was confirmed by the HMBC
correlations (Fig. 2) between H-6′, H-2, and H-6 to C-
7 (δ 165.6). Another HMBC cross-peak between H-1′
(δ 5.26) and C-3 (δ 150.4) established the linkage be-
tween C-3 and C-1′. Thus, the structure of compound
1  was determined as shown in Fig.  1 and the
compound was named jujuphenoside.
Compound 2, epiceanothic acid, was identified by
comparison of its spectral data with those of its isomer,
ceanothic acid (Li et al. 1997), which was confirmed
by two-dimensional NMR experiments (Fig. 3). Com-
pound 2 was a new triterpenoid as a natural product,
whereas it has been reported previously as a synthetic
derivative (Eade et al. 1971).
Compounds 3–5 were identified by comparison of
their melting points and Rf values with authentic
samples.

their spectral data recorded in the previous papers men-
tioned above.
2    Experimental
2.1    General experimental procedures
Optical rotation was determined on a Perkin-Elmer
341 polarimeter (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) at
589 nm. The IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-
Elmer Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectrometer with a KBr disc. The NMR spectra were
obtained on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker
BioSpin Corporation, Fallanden, Switzerland) with
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
was recorded on a Finnigan LCQDECA spectrometer
(ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA, USA). Column chro-
matography (CC) was performed on silica gel (160–
200 mesh and 200–300 mesh; Marine Chemical Factory,
Qingdao, China) and an ODS reversed silica gel (25 ×
2.5 cm; Cosmosil 75 C18-OPN, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto,
Japan). Authentic samples of compounds 3–6 were
stocked in our own laboratory.
2.2    Plant materials
The seeds of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge)
Hu were collected in Xingtai, Hebei Province, China
and identified by Professor Zuo-Cheng ZHAO, Chengdu
Institute of Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
A voucher specimen was deposited in Chengdu Insti-
tute of Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
2.3    Extraction and isolation
The dried and powdered seeds (5.5 kg) of the plant
were extracted with 95% EtOH three times at room
temperature. The residue (500 g), obtained by removal
of the solvent in vacuo, was defatted thoroughly with
petroleum ether (boiling point 60–90 oC) and then ex-
tracted successively with EtOAc and n-butanol.
The EtOAc layer was evaporated to give a residue
(25 g), which was subjected to CC over silica gel eluted
with CHCl3 containing gradually increasing amounts
of MeOH (from 80:1 to 5:1). The eluates were com-
bined to yield six crude fractions (fractions a–f) moni-
tored with thin layer chromatography (TLC). Com-
pounds 3 (35.0 mg), 4 (50.0 mg), and 6 (15.0 mg)
were obtained from fractions a–c, whereas compound
5 (1.2 g) was crystallized from fraction e. Fraction d
(1.8 g) was separated into three fractions on ODS CC
eluted with MeOH-H2O (from 1:1 to 1:0), the second
of which was further separated with CC over silica gel
eluted with petroleum ether-acetone (from 5:1 to 2:1)
to yield compound 2 (50.0 mg). Fraction f (1.1 g) gave
compounds 7 (5.0 mg) and 8 (15.0 mg) after CC on
silica gel eluted with gradient petroleum ether-acetone
(from 10:1 to 7:1).
The solvent of the n-butanol fraction (150 g) was
removed and this fraction was fractioned using a silica
gel column with gradient CHCl3-MeOH (from 10:1 to
1:1) to give seven fractions (fractions A–G). Fraction
B (32 g) was applied to a silica gel column eluted with
gradient CHCl3-MeOH (from 8:1 to 2:1) to afford frac-
tions 1–3. Fraction 1 (5.8 g) was fractionated over a
silica gel column eluted with petroleum ether-acetone
(from 2:1 to 1:1) to afford compound 17 (5.0 mg) and
then the remaining part was separated extensively by
an ODS CC eluted with water followed by increasing
concentrations of methanol to yield compounds 1 (2.0
mg), 9 (14.0 mg), and 10 (6.0 mg). Fraction 2 (2.3 g)
was subjected to ODS CC to give compound 11 (7.0
mg). Fraction 3 (8.3 g) was applied to an ODS CC

eluted with MeOH-H2O (1:1) to afford compounds 18
(12.0 mg) and 19 (17.5 mg). Compounds 12 and 13
(1.2 g) were crystallized from fraction C. Fraction D
(6.0 g) was purified using an ODS silica column devel-
oped with MeOH-H2O (from 3:7 to 7:3) to afford com-
pounds 14 (8.0 mg) and 22 (3.8 g). A mixture (7.0 g)
of compounds 20 and 21 was recrystallized from frac-
tion E. Fraction F (4.0 g) was chromatographed on an
ODS column eluted with MeOH-H2O (1:1) to give com-
pounds 16 (20.0 mg) and 17 (2.0 g). Compound 23
(25.0 mg) was isolated from fraction G.
2.4 Hydrolysis of compound 1
Compound 1 (1.0 mg) was dissolved in 5% NaOH
solution (2 mL) and reacted at room temperature for 3
h. The reaction mixture was neutralized to pH 7 with 1
mol/L HCl solution. The solution was concentrated and
further hydrolysed with acid on TLC. Glucose and
isovanillic acid were detected by direct comparison of
co-TLC with authentic samples: n-BuOH-HAc-H2O (4:
1:5), Rf = 0.4 for glucose; CH2Cl2-EtOAc (3:1), Rf  =
0.3 for isovanillic acid.
