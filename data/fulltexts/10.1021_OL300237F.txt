Their structures were elucidated by means of extensive 2D NMR, IR and MS spectroscopy analyses. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both compounds exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. The genus Abies (Pinaceae) consists of 46 species, which are mainly distributed in temperate and boreal regions of North and Central America, Europe, Asia and North Africa.1 Previous investigations on the chemical composition of firs (Abies) led to the identification of several secondary metabolites such as triterpenoids, flavonoids, stilbenes, chalcones and lignans, some of them exhibiting pharmaceutically relevant biological activities.2-4 Balsam fir-Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. is widely distributed in the eastern part of Canada. Traditionally, it has been used as an antiseptic, tuberculosis remedy and venereal aid.5 Balsam fir, like other true firs, is characterized by the presence of blisters on the surface of young bark that contain an aromatic liquid called the cortical oleoresin. Oleoresin is known as a complex mixture of mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpenoids.6-9 Aboriginal people in Canada have employed fir oleoresin as a vulnerary, although nowadays its main field of utilization is as a cement for lenses and as mounting medium in microscopy.10 In the course of our research program aiming at the isolation and identification of bioactive substances from plant species of Quebec’s boreal forest,11-13 we have become interested in studying the constituents of A. balsamea.12,14-16 This work led to the isolation of two new  tetraterpenoids, abibalsamins A (1) and B (2), which features an unusual 3,4-seco rearranged lanostane triterpene fused with a β-myrcene moiety. The closely related abiesonic acid (3)17 was isolated as well. In this Letter, we report the isolation, structural elucidation and absolute configuration of the new compounds 1 and 2 (Figure 1) based on spectroscopic data, X-ray crystallographic analysis and comparison with literature data.   Figure 1. Structures of abibalsamins A (1) and B (2), and the related abiesonic acid (3).  The oleoresin of A. balsamea (500 g)18 was directly subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexanes/EtOAc as a gradient (100:0 to 93:7), then MeOH. Both hexanes/EtOAc 93:7 and MeOH fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (75 g). A portion of the extract (60 g) was further fractionated on silica gel using a gradient of hexanes/EtOAc, affording three subfractions A-C. Subfraction B was purified by silica gel with hexanes/EtOAc (3:1), giving five other subfractions A'-E'. Repeated column chromatography of subfraction C' on C18 reversed-phase with H2O/MeOH (1:4 to 0:1) followed by purification by preparative HPLC yielded compounds 1 (44.6 mg) and 2 (13 mg). Crystals of 1 were obtained by recrystallization with EtOH. Purification of subfraction E' on polyamide column followed by preparative HPLC separation yielded 3 (10 mg), which was identified as abiesonic acid after spectral caracterization (IR, NMR, MS).17 This compound has been thoroughly described in literature in the form of a dimethyl ester.8,19 Compound 1, [α]20D -24.8 (c 0.9, CHCl3), showed a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 619.4348 [M + H]+ in the HRESIMS suggesting the molecular formula C40H58O5. IR absorptions band at 1702 (s) cm-1 implied the presence of carbonyl functionality. Analysis of 13C NMR data and HSQC spectrum revealed the presence of seven methyls, twelve sp3 methylenes, four sp3 methines, four sp3 quaternary carbons, two sp2 methylenes, three sp2 methines and eight sp2 quaternary carbons. A close comparison of carbon chemical shift of 1 with abiesonic acid (3) suggested a 3,4-seco-rearranged lanostane system with a lateral chain constituted of an additional 6-membered ring. Analysis of the COSY spectrum revealed four spin systems (Figure 2) on the lateral chain which were connected by HMBC cross-peaks from H3-21 to C-17, C-20 and C-22, from H2-22 to C-23, from H-24 to C-23, from H3-27 to C-24, C-25, C-26 and C-31, from H-32 to C-26 and C-35 and from H3-39 and H3-40 to C-38 and C-37.   Figure 2. Selected 1H-1H COSY, HMBC and ROESY correlations for compound 1.  The relative stereochemistry was established with the ROESY spectrum where cross-peaks from H-28Z to H-9 and from H3-19 to H-9 and H3-29 were observed (Figure 2). These facts indicated that H-5, Me-19 and H-9 are positioned ,  and , respectively. Other correlations were observed between H3-18/H-7 and H-30/H-1 suggesting that ring D is connected in such a way that C-17 is -oriented and Me-18 is also . The stereochemistry of the lateral chain could not be established unambiguously with the ROESY spectrum. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out in order to confirm the structure of 1 (Figure 3). The absolute configuration was determined by Flack’s method with Flack’s parameter determined as 0.0(2).20 The X-ray structure demonstrated that the chiral centers in 1 were 5S, 9S, 10S, 13R, 17S, 20R, 24S and 25S. Furthermore, the ROESY correlation between H-28Z and H-24 could be better understood since the measured separation distance was 2.88 Å. On the basis of these spectroscopic evidences, the structure of 1 was assigned as (13R,17S,24S,25S)-24,25-[2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)but-2-ene-1,4-diyl]-23-oxo-3,4-seco-17,13-friedo-8(14→13)-abeo-9H-lanost-4(28),7,14(30)-triene-3,26-dioic acid and named abibalsamin A.21   Figure 3. X-ray structure of abibalsamin A (1).  Compound 2, [α]20D -44.5 (c 1.0, CHCl3), showed a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 633.4514 [M + H]+ in the HRESIMS suggesting the molecular formula C41H60O5. IR absorptions band at 1737 and 1708 (s) cm-1 implied the presence of carbonyl functionalities. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra with those of compound 1 revealed that they differ only by an additional methyl group linked at one of the carboxylic functionalities. An upfield shift at C-3 (6.4 ppm) for 2 along with a HMBC correlation between the new OCH3 group and C-3 were observed and allowed us to assign the structure of 2, named abibalsamin B,22 as (13R,17S,24S,25S)-24,25-[2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)but-2-ene-1,4-diyl]-23-oxo-3,4-seco-17,13-friedo-8(14→13)-abeo-9H-lanost-4(28),7,14(30)-diene-3,26-dioic acid 3-methyl ester.

In opposition to ‘true’ tetraterpenes such as the carotenoids, which are formed by a head-to-head condensation of two geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) units,27 it is likely that abibalsamins 1 and 2 would come from a different biosynthetic route. Since abiesonic acid (3), a 3,4-seco-rearranged lanostane-type triterpenoid,28 as well as the monoterpene β-myrcene have previously been isolated from A. balsamea,29 it seems reasonable to propose that abibalsamin A (1) would be formed by an enzyme-catalyzed [4 + 2] Diels-Alder-like cycloaddition between 3 and β-myrcene. Abibalsamin B (2) would then be obtained by the esterification of C-3 carboxylic acid function in 1. Such a type of Diels-Alder-like biosynthetic reaction has already been suggested for dimeric triterpenoids30 and tricyclic spirolactones,31 to name a few recent examples.  Scheme 1.

The in vitro antiproliferative activities of compounds 1-3 against lung carcinoma (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) and normal skin fibroblasts (WS1) human cell lines were evaluated using the resazurin reduction test as previously described.32 The cytotoxicity results presented in Table 2 are expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50% of the cell growth (IC50). Etoposide was used as a positive control in this assay (IC50 0.3-5 μM). The most cytotoxic compound was abibalsamin B (2) with IC50 values of 8.5 ± 0.7 and 15 ± 1 μM against A549 and DLD-1 cancer cell lines, respectively. Interestingly, abibalsamin A (1) selectively inhibit the growth of A549 cells (IC50 22 ± 4 μM) compared to DLD-1 and WS1 (IC50 >100 μM). Acknowledgment.
