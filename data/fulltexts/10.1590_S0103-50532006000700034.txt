All parts of the plant have been used as crudedrug for the treatment of tumors, piles, skin diseases,wounds and ulcers.1 Extracts of the plant possess significantanti-diarrhoeal, anti-fungal, anti-plasmodial, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities.2Previous phytochemical investigation of this plant indicatedthe presence of abounding prenylated flavonoids such asfuranoflavones, furanoflavonols, chromenoflavones,furanochalcones, and pyranochalcones.3 In this paper, wereported the isolation and identification of two new flavones(1, 2) from the stem bark of Pongamia pinnata.Results and DiscussionThe EtOH extract of Pongmia pinnata stem bark wassubmitted to successive chromatography, affording twonew prenylated flavones 1 and 2 (Figure 1) along with sixknown compounds 3-8.Compound 1, a white powder, gave a molecular ion[M+] at m/z 410.13657 in the HREIMS, indicating amolecular formula C23H22O7 (calc. 410.13655). Togetherwith HMQC spectra, the 1D NMR (13C, 1H and DEPT,Table 1) spectra of compound 1 displayed resonances forone conjugated ketone (δC 173.4, C-4), a pair of ortho-coupling aromatic protons (δH 7.98, 1H, d, J 8.9 Hz, H-5;δH 6.96, 1H, d, J 8.9 Hz, H-6), a monosubstituted aromaticring (δH 7.95, 2H, m, H-2′, 6′; δH 7.55, 3H, m, H-3′, 4′,5′), two oxygenated methines (δH 3.93, 1H, d, J 4.8 Hz,H-3″; δC 69.3, C-3″; δH 6.46, 1H, d, J 4.8 Hz,Figure 1. Structures of compounds 1 and 2.1433Dihydropyranoflavones from Pongamia pinnataVol. 17, No. 7, 2006H-4″; δC 63.2, C-4″), a acetoxy group (δH 1.90, 3H, s, δC170.0, δC 21.0, OAc-4″), two methyls (δH 1.41, 3H, s, δC26.4, Me1-2″; δH 1.38, 3H, s, δC 21.3, Me2-2″), a methoxygroup (δH 3.81, 3H, s, δC 60.1, OCH3-3), and anoxygenated quaternary carbon (δC 79.5, C-2″). With greatsimilarity to those of 5-methoxy-(3″,4″-dihydro-3″,4″-diacetoxy)-2″,2″-dimethylpyrano-(7,8:5″,6″)-flavone,4these 1D NMR data suggested that compound 1 was aflavone with a acetylated dihydropyrano unit. In HMBCspectra, the correlation between H-5 (δH 7.98, 1H, d, J8.9 Hz) and C-4 (δC 173.4) indicated that the ring A wasunsubstituted at the C-5 and C-6 position. The observedHMBC correlations from H-3″ (δH 3.93, 1H, d, J 4.8 Hz,H-3″) to C-8 (δC 108.2), from H-4″ (δH 6.46, 1H, d, J4.8Hz) to C-8 (δC 108.2), C-7(δC 158.3), and C-9 (δC 155.0)suggested that the dihydropyran ring is attached to A ringat C-7(oxygenated) and C-8 postion. The location of theacetoxy group at C-4″ were established by HMBCcorrelations from protons of Me1-2″, Me2-2″ to C-3″, andfrom H-4″ to the carbonyl of OAc-4″. The location of themethoxyl group (δH 3.81) at C-3 was revealed by theHMBC correlation from the protons of methoxy group toC-3 (δC 141.1). The substitution of a hydroxyl group atC-3″ (δC 72.9) was enclosed by chemical shift of C-3″ in13C NMR spectra and the HREIMS data. The molecularstructure of 1 contained two chiral carbon atoms, and therelative configuration of C-3″ and C-4″ was determinedas cis on the basis of coupling constant J3″, 4″ (4.8 Hz) andthe difference (0.03 ppm) in the methyl proton signals atδH 1.41 and δH 1.38 of the 2″-gem dimethyl group.5Accordingly, compound 1 was characterized as 3-methoxy-(3″,4″-dihydro-3″-hydroxy-4″-acetoxy)-2″,2″-dimethylpyrano-(7,8:5″,6″)-flavone.Compound 2, a white powder, gave a molecular ion[M+] at m/z 410.13665 in the HREIMS, corresponding tothe molecular formula C23H22O7 (calc. 410.13655). TheNMR spectral data of 2 (Table 1) were closely comparableto those of compound 1, with the only difference beingdue to the position of the acetoxy group (δH 2.13, 3H, s,δC 170.5, δC 21.3, OAc-3″) and hydroxyl group on thepyran ring. In HMBC spectra, the observed correlationsfrom protons of Me1-2″ (δH 1.41, 3H, s), Me2-2″ (δH 1.35,3H, s) to C-3″ (δC 72.9), and from H-3″ (δH 5.06, 1H, d, J4.8 Hz) to the carbonyl of acetoxyl group suggested theacetoxy group to be located on C-3″ position. Furtheranalysis of the NMR and MS spectra of compound 2indicated the presence of the hydroxyl group at C-4″position. The coupling constant J3″, 4″ was 4.8 Hz and thechemical shift difference of gem-dimethyl signals was 0.06ppm in 1H NMR spectrum. This evidence suggested thatthe relative configuration of compound 2 was cis-form.Thus compound 2 was characterized as 3-methoxy-(3″,4″-dihydro-4″-hydroxy-3″-acetoxy)-2″,2″-dimethylpyrano-(7,8:5″,6″)-flavone.Additionally 6 known compounds, caryophyllene oxide(3),6 obovatachalcone (4),7 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-pentyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (5),8 6,7,2,2-dimethylchromono-8,γ,γ-dimethylallylflavanone(6),9 isolonchocarpin (7),10ovaliflavanone A (8),11 were isolated from this plant andtheir structures elucidated by comparing their spectroscopicdata with those reported in the literature. Compounds 3, 5,6 and 8 were isolated for the first time from this plant.ExperimentalGeneralOptical rotation were measured with a Jasco 1020polarimeter. NMR spectra were obtained on a BrukerAVANCE 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H NMR, 125MHz for 13C NMR). EIMS and HREIMS spectra wererecorded on a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 mass spectrometer.UV spectra were obtained in a Beckman DU-640 UVspectrophotometer. A Waters Nova-pack HR C18 column(19×300mm) was used for semipreparative HPLC, alongwith Waters 600E Multisolvent Delivery System and aWaters 996 Photodiode Array Detector.Plant materialThe material investigated were stem bark of Pongamiapinnata collected in October 2002 from Hainan Province,southern China. The material was identified by ProfessorSi Zhang, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine MateriaMedica, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, ChineseAcademy of Sciences. A voucher specimen is depositedat the herbarium of the South China Sea Institute ofOceanology (No. GKLMMM005).Extraction and isolationThe dryied and powdered stem bark (6 kg) of Pongamiapinnata was extracted with 95% EtOH three times. Afterevaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure, theresidue (300 g) was then extracted successively resultingfour extracts: petroleum (80 g), ethyl acetate (60 g), n-butanol (60 g), and aqueous (80 g). The petroleum extractwas fractionated into 63 fractions by open CC over silicagel with gradient mixtures of petroleum-CHCl3 (6:1) toCHCl3-acetone (0:1) for elution. These fractions werepooled into 17 fractions (P-1~P-17) according to theirsimilarity on TLC. The silica gel CC of Fraction P-8 using1434 Yin et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.petroleum-EtOAc (3:1) afforded 7 fractions (P-8-1 to P-8-7). Fraction P-8-5 were purified by CC of Pharmacia-Sephadex LH-20 with MeOH-H2O (95: 5) and separatedby reverse phase semi-preparative HPLC (ODS column,using MeOH:H2O (66:34) 8 mL min-1, flow rate, UV: 254nm) to give compounds 1 (1.9 mg, tR=16 min) and 2 (5.2mg, tR=19 min). The CC of fraction P-6 using petroleum-EtOAc (35:1) afford 50 fractions (P-6-1 to P-6-50). Thefractions P-6-10, P-6-13, P-6-18, P-6-28, P-6-35 and P-6-38, purified by CC on Pharmacia-Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3-MeOH 5:1) or recrystallization, yield compounds 3 (113mg), 4 (25 mg), 5 (16 mg), 6 (9 mg), 7 (11 mg) and 8 (13mg), respectively.3-methoxy-(3″,4″-dihydro-3″-hydroxy-4″-acetoxy)-2″,2″-dimethylpyrano-(7,8:5″,6″)-flavone (1).
