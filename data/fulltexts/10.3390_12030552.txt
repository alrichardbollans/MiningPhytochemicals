Abstract:  The flavonoid phlorhizin is abundant in the leaves of Sweet Tea (ST, 
Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd). Phlorhizin was preparatively separated and purified 
from a crude ST extract containing 40 % total flavonoids by static adsorption and 
dynamic desorption on ADS-7 macroporous resin and neutral alumina column 
chromatography. Only water and ethanol were used as solvents and eluants 
throughout the whole separation and purification process. Using a phlorhizin standard 
as the reference compound, the target compound separated from the crude ST extracts 
was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EIS-MS) 
and identified as 99.87% pure (by HPLC-UV) phlorhizin. The results showed that 10 
g of the target compound could be obtained from 40 g of the crude extracts in a single 
operation, indicating a 40% recovery. Therefore, this represents an efficient and 
environmentally-friendly technology for separating and purifying phlorhizin from ST 
leaves.

Introduction 
 
1-[2-(β-D-Glucopyranosyloxy)-4,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanone (phlorhi- 
zin, Figure 1), a valuable polyphenolic compound, belongs to the dihydrochalcones, a class of 
flavonoids. It is generally known that phlorhizin is the principal phenolic glucoside in apple trees [1-3]. 
Since it was isolated from the bark of the apple tree in 1835 [4], phlorhizin has been used as a 
pharmaceutical and tool for physiology research for more than 150 years. Its principal pharmacological 
action is to produce renal glycosuria and block glucose transportation by inhibition of the 
sodium-linked glucose transporters (SGLTs) [5-9]. In recent years, beside hypoglycemia and 
hypolipemia [10-12], a series of new bioactive functions of phlorhizin have been found, such as 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation [13], prevention of bone loss [14], enhancement of memory [15, 16], 
inhibition of growth of human colon cancer cells, [17, 18]. As quoted by Ehrenkranz: “The use of 
phlorhizin may provide the molecular basis for the clinical observation that ‘an apple a day keeps the 
doctor away’…” [4], and phlorhizin is attracting the attention of more researchers than ever before.

However, because commercial phlorhizin is currently produced from the root bark of apple trees, 
which can only be harvested once in the plant’s life cycle, its production cost is very high and thus its 
uses are seriously limited. This high production cost hinders the discovery of further and wider 
applications of phlorhizin. Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd is a shrub distributed widely throughout the 
mountainous regions in southern China. Its tender leaves, called Sweet Tea (ST) in southern China, can 
be harvested two or three times a year and have been commonly used as a sweet tonic beverage and 
traditional herb [19], taken for hundreds of years without
 evidence of adverse effects or toxicity. 
During research seeking sweet compounds in the tender leaves, abundant phlorhizin was found, at 
amounts of up to around 7 % [20-23], and thus ST was found to be a potentially new substitute for the 
root bark of apple trees as a rich and cheaper source for phlorhizin production. Nevertheless, there are 
numerous difficulties for the separation of high purity phlorhizin from ST, because phlorhizin exists in 
ST together with many other polyphenolic compounds with similar properties, such as anthocyanin 
[24], and phloretin-4-, and 3-hydroxyphlorhizin D-glucoside [22, 25] (Figure 2), so aside from some 
historical research reporting some analytical scale extractions and separations of phlorhizin from ST 
[20-23, 25, 26], no information on preparative separations of this compound from ST is available. 
Furthermore, in the reported methods of phlorhizin extraction and separation, large volumes of 
hazardous organic solvents, such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, acetone and chloroform 
were used, thus these methods would be considered environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, finding an 
efficient and simple technology to separate phlorhizin from ST leaves is a key step for the efficient Molecules 2007, 12 
 
 
554
utilization of ST as a new source of phlorhizin, and an environmentally-friendly production way is 
much more important nowadays.

In our previous experiments a crude extract was obtained by a microwave-assisted extraction 
method, in which only water was used as solvent. In the present study, a preparative separation of 
phlorhizin from the crude extract of ST was performed. A simple technology for efficient separation of 
phlorhizin in which only water and ethanol were used as solvents and eluants was optimized through a 
great deal of systematic experimentation. The identity of the target compound was confirmed by thin 
layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry (EIS-MS) methods.   
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Separation of the crude extract with ADS-7 resin: effect of adsorption time 
   
When flavonoids are adsorbed by a resin, the amount of free flavonoid in the solution is reduced 
and the concentration will obviously decline. Figure 3 shows the influence of the adsorption time on 
the resin adsorption of flavonoids. As the adsorption time increased from 0 to 2 hr, the free flavonoid 
concentration in the solution was sharply reduced, showing that the amount of flavonoid adsorbed on 
the resin increased rapidly. Then, between 2-3 hr, the adsorption apparently slowed down, and after 3 
hr no further decline in the free flavonoid concentration was detected, which indicated that the 
adsorption equilibrium was reached. As a result, we selected 2 hr as the optimum adsorption time. 
 
Effects of elution speed and volume of desorption solution (Bed Volume, BV) on desorption ratio (DR) 
   
As shown in Figure 4, the maximum DRs were not affected significantly by different elution rates. However, to 
reach the same maximum DR a larger volume of desorption solution was needed at faster elution rates than at slower 
ones. In another words, it took less time to reach the same DR at a faster elution speed than at a slower one. 
Balancing these three factors: high DR, low volume of desorption solution and short elution time, 
we defined 1.0 BV/h and 3 BV as the optimum conditions. Under these optimum conditions, the resin 
separated product (RSP) was obtained, and its total flavonoid content reached 88 %.

Purification of RSP by neutral alumina column     
 
Figure 5 presents the effects of elution rate and volume of desorption solution on purification of the 
target compound from RSP by a neutral alumina column. The alumina column was packed with RSP 
as described in the Experimental section, and was washed with 65 % aqueous ethanol solution at rates 
of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 BV/h, respectively. When the maximum desorption ratio was reached, about 5 BV 
of desorption solution was used at 2.0 BV/h, and about 4 BV of desorption solution was used at elution 
rates of both 1.0 and 1.5 BV/h. However, it took 2.5 h at 2.0 BV/h, 2.7 h at 1.5 BV/h, and about 4 h 
at1.0 BV/h, respectively, to reach the maximum desorption ratio. Therefore, we defined an elution rate 
of 1.5 BV/h and about 2.7 BV of 65 % aqueous ethanol solution as the optimum elution conditions. 
Using the optimized methodology described above and under the conditions described in the 
Experimental section, 10 g of light yellow target compound were obtained from 40 g of the deep 
brown crude extracts in a single operation (the recovery thus reached 25 %). Since the 40 g of crude 
extract in turn came from 300 g of dried ST leaves, the calculated recovery of the target compound 
from ST leaves was 3.3 %.

Purity and molecular identification of the target compound   
 
TLC   
 
The target compound was compared with a reference sample of phlorhizin on a polyamide thin 
layer chromatography plate, as described in the Experimental. Three plates containing both the target 
compound and the phlorhizin standard on the same starting line were eluted with three kinds of eluants. 
The TLC results showed only one spot on each of these eluted plates, and the shape, color and Rf of 
the target compound spot were the same as that of the phloridzin standard on each of the plates, which 
indicated that the target compound was of very high purity and very likely identical to the phloridzin 
standard. 
 
HPLC   
 
The HPLC data of the target compound and the phlorhizin standard are listed in Table 1. As shown, 
the HPLC-UV purity of the target compound was 99.87 %, although it was noted that the retention 
time of the target compound was slightly different from that of a phloridzin standard, a fact that might 
be due to slight differences in the operating conditions. Figure 6 shows the HPLC profile of a mixture 
of equal amounts of the phlorhizin standard and the target compound. Only one main peak with a 
retention time of 6.277 min and 98.74 area % was observed, indicating that the target compound was 
identical to the phloridzin standard by HPLC.

ESI-MS  
  
The ESI-MS spectra of the target compound (A) and the phlorhizin standard (B) are shown in 
Figure 7. The molecular mass of the phlorhizin dihydrate standard is 472 Da, and the expected [M−H]
− 
negative ion was observed in the spectra at m/z 471. Loss of two H2O molecules (36 Da) from this ion 
gave a [M−2H2O−H]
− ion at m/z 435. Cleavage of a glucose fragment without a OH substituent (163 
Da) from the pseudomolecular ion at 435 m/z and protonation resulted in an ion with m/z 273. These 
characteristic ions can be observed in both Figures 6A and 6B, as the data of the [M−H]
− ions of both 
the two compounds displayed the same features, which confirms that the target compound and the 
phlorhizin standard are the same compound. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Sweet Tea (Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd) provides a very rich source of the flavonoid phlorhizin, 
a very valuable bioactive compound and therefore development of an efficient and simple extraction 
and separation technique for this compound is essential to exploit this rich potential resource. In this 
paper, phlorhizin was efficiently separated and purified from the crude ST extracts by a relatively 
simple method, and at the same time, no any organic solvent except for ethanol was used in the whole 
process, thus the described approach is also environmentally friendly.

Crude ST extracts 
 
Crude ST extracts were obtained as described in our previous work (in press) by a 
microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) without use of an organic solvent. The crude extracts were of a 
dark brown color, and the total flavonoid content reached 40 %.

Static adsorption and dynamic desorption by the resin: static adsorption   
 
A pre-weighed amount of resin was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then, three times the amount of 
an aqueous solution of ST extract was added into the flask. The flask was then shaken at room 
temperature (25-30 °C) on a rotator operated at 120 rpm.   Molecules 2007, 12 
 
 
559
Dynamic  desorption   
 
Dynamic desorption experiments were carried out in a 5 cm x 60 cm glass column packed with the 
extract adsorbed resin. The bed volume (BV) of the resin was 200 mL. The column was washed first 
with deionized water till the eluent was colorless, and then desorbed with aqueous ethanol solution 
(80:20, v/v). The eluents were concentrated and dried under vacuum to give the resin separated product 
(RSP). 
 
Dynamic elution on an alumina column 
 
A glass column (5 cm x 60 cm) was wet-packed with neutral alumina, which required about 200 
mL BV. Then RSP (about 20 g) was dissolved in a small amount of 65 % aqueous ethanol solution and 
placed on the top of the neutral alumina column. The loaded column was eluted with 65 % aqueous 
ethanol solution, the eluent was collected, concentrated and crystallized from 40 % aqueous ethanol 
solution at 4 °C. The crystals were dried and weighed before further analyses. The desorption ratio is 
given by the following expression: D = Cd Vd /CR WR x 100, where D is the desorption ratio (%); Cd is 
the concentration of flavonoid in the desorption solution (mg/mL); Vd is the volume of the desorption 
solution; CR is the flavonoid content (mg/g) of RSP loaded on the resin column, and WR is the weight 
(g) of the RSP. 
Analytical methods: Determination of total flavonoid concentrations     
 
These measurements were conducted as described by Liu, et al. [27]. An aliquot of flavonoid 
solution was added to a 25 mL flask containing 5 % NaNO2 (w/w, 0.75 mL) and allowed to react for 6 
min, then 10 % Al(NO3)3 (w/w, 0.75 mL) was added, and 6 minutes later, 4 % NaOH (w/w, 4 mL) was 
added. After mixing, an aqueous solution of 30 % ethanol was added to the flask, which was made up 
to the mark. The solution was allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature, and the absorbance at 
500 nm was determined on a BECKMAN 7400 spectrophotometer. The total flavonoid concentration 
was calculated using rutin as the calibration standard. A good linear relationship was obtained over the 
range of 0.0016 – 0.040 mg/mL, and the regression equation was: y = 0.0059x + 0.0176 (R
2 = 0.9948, 
n=5), where y is the concentration of total flavonoids (mg/mL) and x is the absorbance at 500 nm. 
 
TLC analysis   
  
The sample and standard were co-spotted at the base of polyamide thin layer chromatography 
plates (10.0 cm x 20 cm, produced by Sijia Biochemistry Plastic Company, Taizhou, Zhejiang, P.R. 
China.) that were then developed with three different eluants: (1) 100:2 95 % aqueous ethanol/acetic 
acid; (2) 6:2:2:1 water/1-butanol/acetone/acetic acid, and (3) 10:8:1 acetone/water/acetic acid. The 
eluted plates were dried, stained with 1 % aluminium chloride in ethanol, and observed under 280 nm 
and 360 nm UV light.

HPLC  analysis   
 
All chromatographic analyses were conducted on a Summit HPLC system (Dionex, Germany), 
equipped with a C-18 reversed-phase column (Diamond, 150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm particle size). 
The mobile phase consisted of a 60:40 (v/v) mixture of methanol/water at a flow rate 1.5 mL/min and 
the column effluent was monitored at 283 nm with a UV diode-array detector. The column was 
maintained at ambient temperature (25-30 °C). 
 
EIS-MS  analysis   
 
Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a ZQ2000 mass spectrometer (Waters, USA), 
equipped with an electrospray source. MS parameters were as follows: negative ionization mode, 
capillary, 2.89 kV; source temperature, 100°C; desolvation temperature, 250 °C; mass range, 50 to 800 
m/z.
