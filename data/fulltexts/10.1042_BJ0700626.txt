dimethylnitrosamine.
5. The results indicate that the dimethylamino
groups are oxidized to one carbon-atom inter-
mediates and ammonia, and that the nitroso group
is partly reduced to ammonia.

Nitrogenous Compounds and Nitrogen Metabolism in the Liliaceae
4. ISOLATION OF AZETIDINE-2-CARBOXYLIC ACID AND EVIDENCE FOR
THE OCCURRENCE OF oy-DIAMINOBUTYRIC ACID IN POLYGONATUM*
BY L. FOWDEN AND MARY BRYANT
Department of Botany, Univer8ity College, Gower Street, London, W.C. 1
(Received 5 May 1958)
Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, the lower imino acid
analogue of proline, has been isolated from two
members of the Liliaceae family. Fowden (1955,
1956) isolated it from Convallaria majaliw (lily of
the valley) and characterized it chemically by com-
parison with synthetic material. An identical
substance was isolated from Polygonatusm officinaHli
(a Solomon's seal) by Virtanen and co-workers
(Virtanen, 1955a). A survey of liliaceous and
related plants by Fowden & Steward (1957) demon-
strated&that, the imino acid was present in about
one-quarter of the ninety species examined. Its
distribution was practically confined to the
members of the Liliaceae, although a few species of
the Agavaceae contained small amounts of the
acid. The observation that it is present in certain
members of the latter family, a group of plants
split off rather recently from the Liliaceae, is
interesting since there is no report of its occurrence
in other families. The imino acid often accumulates
in very large amounts and may represent the major
proportion of the non-protein-nitrogen of particular
plants. This is the case for the two species from
which it was isolated. Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid
is not known to occur in plant proteins.
The present paper describes the isolation of
azetidine- 2-carboxylic acid and cmy-diaminobutyric
acid from a liliaceous plant. Diaminobutyric acid,* Part 3: ZachaTius, Cathey & Steward (1957).
AMINO ACIDS OF POLYGONATUM
aspartic acid and homoserine are possible pre-
cursors for the biosynthesis of azetidine-2-carb-
oxylic acid. While aspartic acid is accepted as a
normal constituent of the soluble nitrogeneous
fraction of plants, and homoserine has been shown
to be present in a number of plants (Virtanen,
1955b), ocy-diaminobutyric acid has never been
conclusively shown to occur in a higher plant.
Evidence is now presented that the acid does occur
in small amounts in the non-protein-nitrogen
fraction of Polygonatum, together with the other
two amino acids.
A secondary feature of this investigation has
been the isolation of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in
large quantity from the rhizome of Polygonatum
multiflorium, which can be readily obtained in
England.
EXPERIMENTAL
Chromatographic techniques. All paper chromatograms
were run on Whatman no. 3MM chromatographic-grade
filter-paper sheets under conditions which were essentially
those used by Consden, Gordon & Martin (1944). The
solvents used were water-saturated phenol with NH3
(Dent, 1947), butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5, by vol.)
(Partridge, 1948), 70% (v/v) propanol, and the upper
phase of an ethyl acetate-pyridine-water mixture (2:1:2,
by vol.). A 041% (w/v) solution of ninhydrin in 95 % (v/v)
ethanol was used as the spray reagent.
Extraction of the Polygonatum rhizome. Fresh rhizome
(40 lb.) was washed and coarsely minced. It was then
macerated in an Atomix blendor (M.S.E. Ltd., London)
with sufficient 95% (v/v) ethanol to give a final ethanol
concentration of 70% (v/v). The mush was left at room
temperature for 2 weeks with occassional stirring to allow
complete extraction. The mush was filtered, and the residue
pressed to obtain the maximum yield of extract. The
combined extract (36 1.) was then evaporated in a con-
tinuous rotary vacuum evaporator (Flash Evaporator,
Lab. Glass and Instruments Corp., New York, 31) at 50° to
about 1-5 1. Little ethanol remained in the concentrated
extract at this stage.
Fractionation of the extract on cation-exchange-resin
columns. The extract was diluted to 10 1. and then run
through a column (depth 100 cm., diam. 7 cm.) of Zeo-
Karb 215 in the H+ form (60-80 mesh) at 1 1./hr. The
column was then washed with 30 1. ofwater to elute all non-
cationic substances. Finally the amino acids were dis-
placed by 12 1. of 0-5N-NH3 solution without fractionation.
This procedure was to remove metallic cations since previous
experience had shown that fractionation of amino acids in
plant extracts on Zeo-Karb 215 columns was often poor, if
attempted before the removal of such ions.
The eluate containing the amino acids was again concen-
trated to 10 1. and adjusted to pH 5. It was then applied at
the rate of 1 1./hr. to the same Zeo-Karb column after
regeneration with 2N-HCI. The column was washed with
15 1. of water and elution with aq. 0-5N-NH3 was com-
menced at the rate of about 100 ml./hr. When amino acids
appeared in the eluate, collection of 17 ml. fractions was
commenced. In all 750 fractions were taken. The first 30
fractions contained only aspartic acid; the next 430 con-
tained azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, with smaller amounts of
aspartic acid and glutamic acid. These 430 fractionswere
pooled to give eluate A, from which the imino acid was
isolated. Fractions 460-505 contained the hydroxyamino
acids serine and threonine in addition to the previous acids,
and homoserine appeared in fractions 506-534. Neutral
amino acids then began to appear in the eluate. Fractions
615-667 were pooled as eluate B, which contained both
neutral and basic amino acids, together with asparagine
and y-aminobutyric acid. Fractions 668-750 contained
mainly lysine and arginine with smaller amounts of other
amino acids.
Isolation of azetidine-2-carboxylic acidfrom eluate A. This
eluate (7-3 1.) was concentrated in vacuo at 500 to about
250 ml. The concentrate was decolorized by treatment with
absorbent charcoal, adjusted to pH 7 by addition of 1ON-
NH3 and evaporated in vacuo to about 100 ml. When the
solution was kept at about - 10°, 18-9 g. of azetidine-2-
carboxylic acid crystallized out. Successive concentration
and crystallization yielded 40 g. of the imino acid. The
ammonium salts of glutamic and aspartic acids remained in
solution. The azetidine-2-carboxylic acid was dissolved in
the minimum quantity of hot water and boiling ethanol
added to the point of crystallization. On cooling, 33 g. of
white crystals of the L-imino acid were obtained.
Chromatographic identification of aspartic acid and homo-
serine. A small amount of crude aspartic acid was obtained
by concentration and crystallization of fractions 1-30.
Crude homoserine was obtained as a sticky residue from a
portion of the pooled fractions 506-534 by separation from
the other amino acids by paper chromatography. The pre-
parations of aspartic acid and homoserine were identified
by co-chromatography with authentic samples, in all four
solvent systems.
Isolation of cxy-diaminobutyric acid from eluate B. This
eluate was concentrated in vacuo to 500 ml. and then
applied at the rate of 80 ml./hr. to a column (depth 42 cm.,
diam. 2-5 cm.) of Dowex 50-X4 (100-200 mesh) in the H+
form. The column was then washed with 2 1. of water and
the amino acids eluted with 0-2N-NH3 solution. Eighty
fractions of 17 ml. were collected. Fractions 72-76 con-
tained diaminobutyric acid and an unidentified amino acid
in about equal amounts, together with traces of glycine and
valine. Fractions 77-80 contained mainly the unidentified
amino acid with smaller amounts of diaminobutyric acid.
Fractions 72-76 were evaporated in vacuo to a syrup.
This was dissolved to give 3 ml. of solution and 1 ml. was
applied as a streak across one edge of each of three sheets of
washed Whatman no. 3MM filter paper (24 in. x 24 in.).
The chromatograms were developed in the butanol-acetic
acid mixture for 1 week; a good separation of diamino-
butyric acid from the slower-moving unknown substance
was effected; each component was eluted separately from
the chromatograms.
The eluate containing the diaminobutyric acid was
decolorized by treatment with charcoal and evaporated in
vacuo; a few drops of conc. HCl were added before final
drying. The residue (61 mg.) was dissolved in the minimum
volume of hot water and a hot mixture of equal volumes of
conc. HCl and acetic acid was added. After crystallization
at 00, 28 mg. of crystals, m.p. 195-1980 (decomp.), was
collected. The mixed m.p. with an authentic sample of
L-diaminobutyric acid dihydrochloride (m.p. 194-1970,
decomp.) prepared by the method of Adamson (1939) was

The isolate was inseparable from diaminobutyric acid
when run on chromatograms developed in all four solvents
listed above. After a portion of the isolate had been mixed
with a sample of [14C]diaminobutyric acid (prepared from
[I4C]glutamic acid by a micro modification of the method
of Adamson, 1939), the mixture was chromatographed on
papers developed in phenol-aq. NH3 and butanol-acetic
acid. Radioautographs from the dry chromatograms were
compared with the chromatograms after development with
ninhydrin. The radioactive areas coincided with those of
the ninhydrin-reacting material.
The isolate was converted into azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid and a-hydroxy-y-aminobutyric acid (Fowden, 1956)
by mixing 5 mg. with 14 mg. of solid AgNO2 and 0415 ml.
of 1ON-HCI. The mixture was kept in a boiling-water bath
for 45 min.; it was then diluted to 1 ml. with water, and the
precipitated AgCl removed by centrifuging. The super-
natant was evaporated to dryness several times to remove
excess of HCI. The residue was diasolved finally in 0 5 ml.
of water, solid Ba(OH),,8H2O added to give a 0 5 N-solution,
and the mixture heated at 1000 for 30 min. Barium was
precipitated as sulphate and any excess of H2S04 was
neutralized by addition of solid BaCO.. After centrifuging,
the clear liquid was evaporated to dryness and the residue
redissolved in a small volume of water. Measured portions
were used to prepare two-dimensional chromatograms,
which were developed in phenol-aq. NH3, followed by
butanol-acetic acid. Development with ninhydrin re-
vealed a brown spot that was inseparable from added
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and a purple spot coincident
with added y-amino-o-hydroxybutyric acid. The conver-
sion into these two products is specific for diaminobutyric
acid as a starting material.
DISCUSSION
The concentrations of the free amino acids present
in the rhizome of Polygonatum are small in relation
to the concentration of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid;
the imino acid usually accounted for 75% or more
of the total non-protein nitrogen of the tissue. Few
steps are involved in the isolation procedure and so
the preparation of the imino acid in this way has
a definite advantage over chemical synthesis from
glutamic acid (Fowden, 1956). The synthesis gives
either D- or DL-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, which
for biological purposes is less useful than the L-
form obtained by isolation.
The fact that homoserine occurs in Polygonatum
is of interest since it may be implicated in azetidine-
2-carboxylic acid metabolism. First isolated from
peas (Miettinen, Kari, Moisio, Alfthan & Virtanen,
1953), homoserine has later been found in many
other plants (Virtanen, 1955 b). The present authors
also (unpublished observations) have shown that it
is a common constituent of higher plants, although
normally only in small amounts relative to those of
other free amino acids. This finding is not un-
expected since homoserine is known to be an inter-
mediate in the biosynthesis of threonine in yeast
(Watanabe, Konishi & Shimura, 1955).
The isolation and characterization of ocy-diamino-
butyric acid as a natural product of higher plants
adds another amino acid to the very considerable list
of new non-protein acids isolated by chromato-
graphic methods during the last decade. Previously
diaminobutyric acid had been known only as a
metabolic product of certain micro-organisms,
being present in several peptides possessing anti-
biotic properties; these include the polymyxins
(Catch, Jones & Wilkinson, 1949), circulin (Peter-
son & Reineke, 1949), and colistin (Oda & Ueda,
1954). Zacharius, Pollard & Steward (1955) sug-
gested that it may be present in potato tuber, from
chromatographic evidence only.
The new diamino acid is a member of the series
which includes ornithine and lysine. Of the three
acids, only lysine is known as a constituent of
proteins from plants. The presence of ornithine in
plants has only recently been established and the
free base does not seem to have been isolated yet in
sufficient quantities for strict chemical identifica-
tion to be made. Coleman (1958) has isolated and
chemically identified it as a 2:4-dinitrophenyl
derivative from extracts of sulphur-deficient flax
plants. Kasting & Delwiche (1957) have prepared
from barley leaves, wheat roots and water-melon
seedlings small amounts of a substance with
chromatographic properties and specific colour
reactions identical with those of ornithine. The
identification of this series of three basic amino
acids now means that each known imino acid of
plants (azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, proline, and
pipecolic acid) is matched by a naturally occurring
diamino acid that may act as a precursor in their
biosynthesis. Ornithine is established as a pre-
cursor of proline (Vogel, 1955), and lysine of
pipecolic acid (Grobbelaar & Steward, 1953;
Lowy, 1953).
SUMMARY
1. The amino acids in a 70% ethanol extract of
40 lb. of the rhizome of Polygonatum multiflorum
(Solomon's seal) were fractionated on ion-exchange
resin columns and by paper chromatography.
2. Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (40 g.) was iso-
lated. Evidence was also obtained for the presence
of aspartic acid and homoserine.
3. Diaminobutyric acid was isolated in small
amount as its dihydrochloride. This represents the
first unequivocal isolation of this diamino acid
from a higher plant material.
This investigation was carried out while one of us (M. B.)
held a Postgraduate Research Studentship of the University
of London. The continuous rotary vacuum evaporator
was purchased with the help of a grant from the Central
Research Funds Committee of the University of London.

Some Observations on a Hydroxypipecolic Acid
from Thrift (Armeria maritima)
BY L. FOWDEN
Department of Botany, Univer8ity College, Gower Street, London, W.C. 1
(Received 5 May 1958)
In recent years, knowledge of the free amino and
imino acid components of plants has expanded
rapidly (for reviews, see Virtanen, 1956, 1957;
Steward & Pollard, 1957; Fowden, 1958). More
than thirty new acids, additional to the twenty or
so present in proteins, are known as products of
higher-plant metabolism. Imino acids are among
these newer compounds, and several contain a
piperidine ring. Pipecolic acid (piperidine-2-
carboxylic acid) is the most commonly found
member of this group, being particularly charac-
teristic of the legumes (Zacharius, Thompson &
Steward, 1954), although it occurs in members of
many other families (Morrison, 1953). Baikiain
(A4:5-dehydropipecolic acid), which occurs far less
frequently in plants than pipecolic acid, was first
isolated from Baikiaea plurijuga (Rhodesian teak),
in which it occurs in relatively large amounts in
both the seeds (Grobbelaar, Pollard & Steward,
1955) and the wood (King, King & Warwick, 1950).
Hyde (1955) considers it to be a constituent of the
developing pea seed. 5-Hydroxypipecolic acid was
isolated from a palm (Rhapi8 flabelliformi8) by
Virtanen & Kari (1954), and from Baikiaea by
G4robbelaar et al. (1955). It is also present in the
fruit of the date palm, and accompanies pipecolic
acid in several legume seeds, including the pea
(Hyde, 1955). Another hydroxypipecolic acid,
considered to be 4-hydroxypipecolic acid, was
isolated from Acacia pentadena by Virtanen &
Kari (1955). In Acacia the two hydroxypipecolic
acids co-existed, but in Albizzia lophantha only the
presumed 4-hydroxy compound was present.
The present investigation reports the isolation of
a hydroxypipecolic acid from thrift (Armeria
maritima), a member of the family Plumbagin-
aceae. This substance is identical with that isolated
from Acacia. However, evidence will be presented
to suggest that these compounds may be 3-
hydroxypipecolic acid, and not the 4-hydroxy
derivative as suggested by Virtanen & Kari (1955).

All melting points are corrected.

were as described by Fowden & Bryant (1958).
Synthesis of hydroxypipecolic acid8
4-Hydroxypipecolic acid. This was obtained in small
yield by catalytic hydrogenation of 4-hydroxypicolinic
acid (4-hydroxypyridine-2-carboxylic acid), m.p. 2630
(decomp.), which was prepared by the method of Meyer &
Graf (1928), who gave m.p. 254-255° (decomp.). 4-
Hydroxypicolinic acid (1-1 g.) was dissolved in 20 ml. of
water and converted into its hydrochloride by the addition
of the calculated amount of HCI. PtO (0-2 g.) was added
and a slow stream of H. was passed through the mixture in
a water bath at 90° for 12 hr. After 6 hr. the catalyst was
replaced by a further 0-2 g. of PtO. After final removal of
the Pt, the mixture was evaporated to about 5 ml., when
much unchanged 4-hydroxypicolinic acid hydrochloridte
