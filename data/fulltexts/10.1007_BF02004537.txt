MBH-I.min-l) .  Peripheral injection of NSD-1015 in a dose 
range of 100-200 mg-kg -E has also been shown to inhibit 5- 
HT oxidative-deamination as well as 5-HTP decarboxylation 
17-19. This results in a linear increase in 5-HTP and a linear 
decrease in 5-HIAA white 5-HT levels remain unchanged (i.e., 
'steady-state levels'). Thus, an obvious advantage in using a 
drug like NSD-1015, which inhibits both 5-HT synthesis and 
catabolism, to estimate 5-HT turnover rates is the avoidance of 
possible feedback effects on the rate of 5-HT synthesis. 
Our results also demonstrated decreased rates of 5-HT catabo- 
lism nocturnally. The rate of decline in 5-HIAA levels follow- 
ing pargyline administration is often used as a measure of 5- 
HT synthesis 2~ In our study, the estimated rates of 5-HT oxi- 
dative-deamination in NSD-1015 and pargyline treated rats 
were not significantly different either diurnally or nocturnally, 
suggesting that treatment with NSD-1015 inhibited 5-HT oxi- 
dative-deamination to a degree comparable with that due to 
treatment with pargyline. The discrepancies among regression 
coefficients obtained from the rise in 5-HTP levels and the de- 
cline in 5-HIAA levels after treatment with NSD-1015 could 
be explained by the existence of multiple pools of 5-HT with 
different turnover rates 21.

Summary. Two African species of Aspilia (Asteraceae), which are used medicinally by man and which are eaten by wild chimpan- 
zees in an unusual manner, were found to contain the potent antibiotic thiarubrine A as a major leaf phytochemical. Its presence 
in leaf material strengthens the view that the feeding behavior of wild chimpanzees is related to special physiological or pharma- 
cological effects on the animals. 
Key words. Aspilia; chimpanzees, feeding behavior; thiarubrine A. 
In various parts of  Africa, numerous species of the genus Aspi- 
lia (Heliantheae, Asteraceae) are used for medicinal purposes 2. 
For example, extracts of the root of A. holstii are prepared by 
the Shambala people for the relief of lumbago, sciatica and 
neuralgia 2. The leaves of Aspilia afrieana from Nigeria, Came- 
roon and Ghana are used to clean sores, relieve stomach trou- 
bles, as a cough medicine, and in some cases, to remove cor- 
neal opacities 3. More recently, Wrangham and Nishida 4 re- 
ported that wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) selectively 
pick and swallow entire leaves of A.mossambieensis Oliv., 
A.pluriseta O. Hoffm., and A.rudis Oliv. without chewing 
them. This unusual feeding behavior by chimpanzees suggested 
to Wrangham and Nishida that the apes consume the leaves 
for some special pharmacological effects 4. Janzen 5 has 
presented circumstantial evidence suggesting that certain 
mammals eat plants for their medicinal properties instead of 
for nutritional content. Ent-kaurenic diterpenoid acids have 
been reported from South American species of Aspilia 6 and an 
acetylenic compound has been identified in A.montevidensis 7. 
There appear to be no phytochemical reports on African spe- 
cies of Aspilia. 
Dried leaves of Aspilia mossambicensis from Mahale National 
Park and A.pluriseta from Kenya were finely ground and ex- 
tracted with chloroform and taken to dryness in vacuo. The 
residue was dissolved in methanol and chromatographed in a 
Sephadex LH-20 column. Mass spectral analysis of a red oil

previously isolated and identified from Iva 7, Ambrosia 7, 
Schkuhria 7, Palafoxia 7, Eriophyllum 9 and Chaenactis 9. Al- 
though many species of the Asteraceae are used for a variety of 
medicinal purposes, the Okanagan-Colville Indians of British 
Columbia, Canada and Washington, USA, used Chaenactis 
douglassi var. achilleaefolia which contain thiarubrine A to 
treat wound infections and sores and as an eyewash 1~ 
Thiarubrine A has been found to be as effective as the strong 
photosensitizer, c~-terthienyP l against Candida albicans, Staph- 
ylococcus aIbus, Mycobacterium phlei, Bacillus subtilis, Strepto- 
coccus faecalis and E. coli either in UV-A or in light in the 
range of 0.1-1.0 ppm 8. It is as effective against Candida albi- 
cans as fungizone at a concentration of 1 ppm in dark or 0.1 
ppm in light. At 10 ppm it causes 100% mortality in the free 
living nematode Coenorhabtidis elegans. It is also toxic to Chi- 
nese hamster ovary cells at 4 ppm in dark and phototoxic at 
0.25 ppm 11. It is therefore a potent biocidal agent. A rough 
estimate of the amount in a single leaf would be 5 rag, which 
would be the amount ingested by a chimpanzee per diem. The 
compound is unstable under acidic conditions, being converted 
to the corresponding thiophene 9. Its metabolic fate in the GI 
tract of the chimpanzee is therefore of interest. 
The medicinal use of species of Aspilia by Africans to cure 
sores and other skin infections would appear to make sense 
since thiarubrine A is such a strong antibiotic. Aspilia mossam- 
bicensis has been used in east Africa for the treatment of ab- 
dominal pains and intestinal worms, including hookworm 12. 
Wild chimpanzees harbor many of the nematodes, trematodes 
and protozoans common to man 13,14. Whether thiarubrine A is 
an effective oral antibiotic or anthelmintic awaits further in- 
vestigation.

Chemical attraction of  the eastern yellowjacket,  Vespula maculifrons (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) 1

USDA-ARS, Insect Physiology Laboratory, Building. 467, BARC-East, Beltsville (Maryland 20705, USA), 27 March 1984 
Summary. Workers and queens of the eastern yellowjacket, Vespula maculifrons, are attracted to the artificial long-range attrac- 
tant pheromone of the predaceous pentatomid, Podisus maculiventris. A 1:1 mixture of linalool or c~-terpineol and (E)-2-hexenal 
is as attractive to V. maculifrons workers as the pheromone. 
Key words. Yellowjacket, eastern; Vespula maculifrons; attraction, chemical; pheromone, attractant; Podisus macuIiventris. 
Heptyl butyrate, 2, 4-hexadienyl butyrate and a variety of simi- 
lar esters are potent and specific attractants for Vespula pensyl- 
vanica and other yellowjackets in the western United States 2, 3, 
but these attractants are ineffective for eastern yellowjackets 4' 2. 
While field-testing a synthetic aggregation pheromone for the 
predaceous spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Hemip- 
tera: Pentatomidae), we noticed that pheromone-baited traps 
caught many more Vespula spp. than unbaited traps. Compo- 
nents of the P.maculiventris aggregation pheromone 6 were 
field-tested singly and in pairs to determine which compounds 
are attractive to yellowjackets. 
Methods and materials. Components of the P. maculiventris ag- 
gregation pheromone (indicated by an asterisk in the table) 
and the other compounds tested were purchased from Aldrich 
Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wl) or Bedoukian Research Inc. 
(Danbury, CN) except the enantiomers of e-terpineol and 
(E)-2-hexenyl crotonate. (+)-e-Terpineol and (-)-c~-terpineol 
were synthesized from (+)-a-pinene (Aldrich Chem.) and ( - ) -  
a-pinene (Tridom Chem,, Hauppauge, NY) 7. (E)-2-Hexenyl 
crotonate was synthesized from (E)-2-hexenol and erotonic 
acid by standard methods. 
Field-tests for yellowjacket attraction were conducted in and 
around deciduous woods at the Agricultural Research Center- 
East, Beltsville, Maryland, during 1982 and 1983. Sticky wing 
traps (Zoecon Corp, Palo Alto, CA) were used and baited 
daily with 10 gl of the neat compound(s) applied to a 5 x 9 
rubber septum (Thomas Scientific, Philadelphia, PA) in the 
bottom of the trap (1982 experiment) or baited every four days 
with 350 mg of  a 20% (W/W) formulation of the compounds 
in plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Tenneco, Piscataway,
