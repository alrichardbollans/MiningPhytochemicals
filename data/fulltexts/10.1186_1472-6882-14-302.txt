To reduce the toxicity of R. palmatum and alleviateany symptoms of decanta and celialgia, the raw material has been subjected to a specific process prior to its usefor hundreds of years. Despite its extensive use in medicine, very little is currently known about the nature of thecomponents present in this material in terms of their efficacy and overall toxicity, and the effect that processing hason the levels of these components in the processed material. The aim of this investigation was to explore potentialdifferences in the chemical markers between batches of raw and processed R. palmatum and to develop a deeperunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity of theprocessed material.Methods: Raw and processed R. palmatum samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysisusing principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).Results: The emodin-8-O-glucoside, emodin-O-glucoside, catechin-glucopyranoside, gallic acid-3-O-glucoside,torachrysone, and chrysophanol dimethyl ether were rapidly explored as representative markers to distinguishfor the first time between the raw and processed R. palmatum material. Among the potential chemical markers,Emodin-8-O-glucoside and gallic acid-3-O-glucoside were determined to be the best markers for the raw andprocessed R. palmatum.Conclusion: UPLC/Q-TOF-MS with multivariate statistical analysis represents an efficient method for exploringthe chemical markers in the raw and processed R. palmatum material, as well as investigating the mechanismsassociated with the processing, quality control, and safe application of R. palmatum.Keywords: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole\time-of-flight mass spectromet- ry,Multivariate statistical analysis, Rheum palmatum, Herb processing, Chemical markers* Correspondence: lfhuang@implad.ac.cn1Institute of Medicinal Medicinal plant Development, Chinese Academy ofMedical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:302 Page 2 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/302BackgroundProcessing is an important part of traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM), and most of the processes involved inTCM were developed almost 5,000 years ago, alongwith a number of processing technology theories andmethods, such as frying with sand or oil, sautéing withrice wine or wheat bran, steaming with water or ricewine, and braising with rice wine or licorice liquids [1].According to the theories of TCM, the main purposes ofherb processing are to increase potency, reduce toxicity,and alter the effectiveness of the raw materials. Themajor mechanisms underlying herb processing are predom-inantly related to changes in the chemical compositionand/or activity of the components in herbs [2].R. palmatum, which is known as Da-huang (DH) inChinese, is officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia[3] and is widely used as a TCM for alleviating thesymptoms of fever, moistening aridity, purging fire, anddetoxifying toxicosis [4]. R. palmatum contains a varietyof different components, including anthraquinones, dia-nthrones, stilbenes, anthocyanins, flavonoids, polyphenols,organic acids, and chromones [5]. Among these materials,several anthraquinone derivatives, including emodin,chrysophanol, rhein, aloe-emodin, and physcion, aswell as their corresponding glucosides, have been iden-tified as important bioactive components, and reportedto exhibit a variety of pharmacological effects, such aspurgative [6], anti-inflammatory [7], anticancer [8],nephric protection [9], hepatic protection [10], anti-microbial and hemostasis activities [11,12]. Severalreports have appeared in the literature, however, sug-gesting that the rhubarb components of R. palmatumhave an adverse impact on liver and kidney function, asFigure 1 Strategy proposed for rapidly exploring potential chemical mUPLC–QTOF-MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis.well as causing gastrointestinal reactions [13-15], andsome of the anthraquinone and tannin compoundspresent in R. palmatum have been reported to be toxic[16]. R. palmatum has been subjected to the standardprocessing technologies used in TCM reduce the tox-icity of the raw material, as well as alleviating anysymptoms of decanta and celialgia, and the resultingmaterial has been used in clinical practice for hundredsof years R. palmatum wine, prepared R. palmatum,and charred R. palmatum have been well documentedin the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as therapeutic materials[4], whereas the use of vinegar R. palmatum has beenrecorded in the standardized processing of traditionalChinese medicine (version 1988) [17]. Potential chem-ical markers and mechanisms of increased effect anddecreased toxicity of R. palmatum are yet to be identi-fied and understood. In this study, we have proposedan experimental scheme of screening the markers andidentifying raw and processed R. palmatum (Figure 1).Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupoletime-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) is anewly developed technique that provides rapid and efficientaccess to detailed information pertaining to the nature ofspecific components within complex multicomponent mix-tures. UPLC-QTOF-MS has been widely used in variousfields for the analysis of a broad range of different materials,and has been used to particularly good effect for metaboliteanalysis and the identification of the complex compoundsfound in TCMs [18]. We previously reported the use ofUPLC-QTOF-MS in conjunction with multivariatestatistical analysis to discriminate between raw andprocessed samples of Coptis chinensis and Eriobotryajaponica [19-21]. This technique has several significantarkers for discrimination of raw and processed R. palmatum byWang et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:302 Page 3 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/302advantages over traditional phytochemical methods foridentifying chemical markers, in that it avoids the re-quirement for time-consuming extraction, isolation,purification, and identification processes. Herein, wedescribe the development of an effective UPLC–QTOF-MSmethod that is capable of distinguishing between raw andprocessed R. palmatum (i.e., raw wine R. palmatum, vin-egar R. palmatum, prepared R. palmatum, and charred R.palmatum) using principal component analysis (PCA)and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA). To the best of our knowledge, this methodrepresents the first reported account of an analyticalmethod capable of differentiating between raw andprocessed R. palmatum. Several chemical markers werescreened and tentatively identified in batches of the rawand processed materials between each processed sample.The results of this study have provided a deeper under-standing of the underlying mechanisms responsible forthe increased efficacy and decreased toxicity of the proc-essed material. This approach therefore represents a usefultool for distinguishing between raw and processed R.palmatum.MethodsChemicals, solvents, and samplesUPLC-grade acetonitrile, methanol, and formic acid werepurchased from Fisher Scientific Co. (Fair Lawn, MA,USA). All of the aqueous solutions used in the currentstudy were prepared using ultrapure water produced by aMilli-Q system (18.2 MΩ, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).R. palmatum was collected from Gansu Minxian(Gansu, China) on the November 20, 2012. The botan-ical materials were identified by Professor Lin Yulin, andvoucher specimens were deposited at the Institute ofMedicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy ofMedical Sciences, Beijing, China. The detail of the sam-ples’ vouchers lists as sdh1-3 of Raw DH (R), dht1-3 ofCharred DH (C), shudh1-3 of Prepared DH (P), jdh1-3of Wine DH (W), cdh1-3 of Vinegar DH (V).Liquid chromatographyTwo microliter samples were analyzed on a 2.1 ×100 mm ACQUITY™ 1.7 μm BEH C18 column (Waters,Milford, MA, USA), which was maintained at 40°C usingan Waters ACQUITY™ UPLC system. The mobile phasesconsisted of (A) water containing 0.1% (w/w) formic acidand (B) methanol. The UPLC elution conditions were opti-mized as follows: linear gradient from 5 to 15% B (0 to2.0 min), 15 to 20% B (2.0 to 3.0 min), and 20 to 25% B(3 to 4 min), where it was held for 1 min before being in-creased from 25 to 30% B (5 to 6 min), 30 to 40% B (6 to7 min), 40 to 55% B (7 to 8 min), 55 to 65% B (8 to 9 min),65 to 85% B (9 to 10 min), 85 to 95% B (10 to 11 min), and95 to 5% B (11 to 12 min), where it was then held for3 min. The flow rate was set at 0.35 mL/min, and the col-umn and autosampler were maintained at 40 and 5°C, re-spectively. Each wash cycle consisted of 200 μl of thestrong solvent (80% ACN in water - v/v) and 600 μL of theweak solvent (30% ACN in water – v/v). The scan range forPDA detector system was set at 190 to 400 nm. All of theexperiments were performed in triplicate.Mass spectrometryMS analysis was performed on a Q-TOF premiermass spectrometer (Waters Micromass Technologies,Manchester, UK), which was operated in the negativeion mode using electrospray ionization. The capillaryand cone voltages were set to 3000 and 35 V, respect-ively. The nebulization gas was maintained at a flowrate of 800 L/h and a temperature of 450°C. The conegas was maintained at a flow rate of 50 L/h, and thesource temperature was set to 120°C. MS data werecollected for m/z values in the range of 50 to 1,200 Dawith a scan time of 0.1 s and an inter-scan delay of0.01 s over an analysis time of a 15 min. The [M–H]−ion of leucine-enkephalin was seen at m/z 556.2771,with a concentration of 0.5 ng/μL in the negative ionmode. Argon was employed as the collision gas at apressure of 7.066 × 10−3 Pa. All of the MS data werecollected using the LockSpray system to ensure massaccuracy and reproducibility.Sample preparationR. palmatum samples were processed according to themethods described in the 2010 edition of the ChinesePharmacopoeia. Raw R. palmatum (R) were cut into 2-to 4-mm-thick slices or pieces and then dried. Wine R.palmatum (W) was prepared with rice wine (20% w/w).Vinegar R. palmatum (V) was prepared with vinegar(20% w/w). Prepared R. palmatum (P) was prepared withrice wine (20% w/w) and then steamed until it was blackin appearance on both its inside and outside. Charred R.palmatum (C) was prepared by stir frying R. palmatumuntil it was black/brown in color on the outside andburnt-brown or black/brown in color on the inside. Allof the samples were milled into powders, and individualportion of the powdered samples (0.150 g) were dis-solved in methanol. The resulting samples were thenextracted for 30 min using an ultrasonic cleaner in awater bath (45°C). The extracts were centrifuged at12,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was injecteddirectly into the UPLC-Q/TOF system for analysis.Establishment of an in-house library and peak assignmentData pertaining to the different components of R.palmatum were collected from various different data-bases, including PubMed for the U.S. National Libraryof Medicine and the National Institute of Health,Wang et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:302 Page 4 of 10http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/302SciFinder Scholar for the American Chemical Society,and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure ofTsinghua University. The collected data were summa-rized in a Microsoft Office Excel table to establish anin-house library, which included the name, molecularformula, UV maximum wavelength, chemical struc-ture, and reference of each known compound. The“Find” function in Microsoft Office Excel was used tomatch the empirical molecular formula with that ofpublished compounds within the library. The empiricalmolecular formula was deduced from and shortlistedby comparing the accurately measured mass value tothe exact mass value of putative deprotonated molecularions [M–H]− at a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm.Multivariate data processingThe UPLC-MS data of all determined samples were ana-lyzed using the MarkerLynx software (Waters) to iden-tify potential discriminatory chemical markers and allowfor the raw and processed DH to be subjected to somemeasure of quality control. For data collection, themethod parameters were set as follows: retention timein the range of 0 to 15 min, mass in the range of 50 to1200 Da, and noise elimination level set at 5. For dataanalysis, a list composed of the identities of the detectedpeaks was generated using retention time (tR)–mass data(m/z) pairs as the identifier for each peak. An arbitraryID was assigned to each of these tR–m/z pairs based ontheir order of elution from the UPLC system. The ionintensity for each detected peak was normalized againstthe sum of the peak intensities within that sample. Ionidentification was based on the tR and m/z values. Paretoscaling method was used to generate the PCA plot. Theresulting three-dimensional data comprising the peaknumber (tR–m/z pair), sample name, and ion intensitywere analyzed by PCA and OPLS-DA.Results and discussionChromatographic conditions of UPLCSeveral different mobile phase systems were evaluated inthe current study, including the use of an organic phase(i.e., acetonitrile and methanol) with a variety of differentaqueous phases (i.e., water, water containing formic acid,water containing triethylamine, as well as water contain-ing formic acid and ammonium). The results of an ex-tensive period of evaluation revealed that a mixture ofacetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) wasthe most suitable mobile phase. The gradient elutionprofile was optimized with respect to the separation ofthe major peaks and, under the optimized chromato-graphic conditions, the major components in R. palma-tum could be well separated and detected within 15 min.UPLC-QTOF-MS chemical analysis18 compounds were tentatively identified based on theirfragment ions (Figure 2) as well as a comparison withdata from the literature [22-25]. All of these compoundshave been previously reported to be present in R.palmatum and are listed in Table 1.Confirmation of TCM processing theories with raw andprocessed DHThe results of the PCA of the raw and processed R.palmatum are shown in Figure 3. These results showthat the raw R. palmatum, wine R. palmatum, vinegarR. palmatum, prepared R. palmatum, and charred R.palmatum samples were divided into five main clustersin the PCA score plot. The division of these data intoclusters effectively indicated that use of different pro-cessing methods could significantly alter the compos-ition of compounds within the different materials, andthis separation could therefore be representative oftheir multiple pharmacological effects. According tothe PCA, charred R. palmatum (C) clustered in theupper right region, whereas prepared R. palmatum (P)clustered into the bottom right region, In contrast,wine R. palmatum (W) and vinegar R. palmatum (V)clustered into the bottom left region of the PCA. Theprepared R. palmatum (P) was clustered far from themiddle region, which indicated that remarkable chem-ical changes had occurred during the processing of thismaterial. The wine R. palmatum (W) and vinegar R.palmatum (V) clusters were close to each other, whichindicated that similar chemical changes had occurredduring their processing. The results of this experimenttherefore clearly demonstrated the importance of theprocessing method to the chemical composition of thefinished material.Multivariate statistical analysis and exploring chemicalmarkersExtensive statistical analyses were performed to generate anS-plot, which could be used to identify potential chemicalmarkers for distinguishing between raw and processed R.palmatum (Figures 4A and 5, and Table 2). In Figure 4A,the first three ions (i.e., a, b, and c) in the bottom left cornerof the “S” are the ions from the raw R. palmatum samplethat contributed the greatest difference observed in thedata between the raw and processed R. palmatum. Ionsa, b, and c could therefore be used as potential chem-ical markers to distinguish between samples of raw andprocessed R. palmatum. Ion a was identified as themost characteristic of these three chemical markers inraw R. palmatum. Similarly, ions d, e, and f wereidentified as the most characteristic ions of processedR. palmatum, and represented the biggest differencebetween the raw and processed R. palmatum.

Ionsa (Emodin-8-O-glucoside) and d (Gallic acid-3-O-glucoside) were determined to be the most characteris-tic chemical markers for distinguishing between raw R.palmatum and prepared R. palmatum (Figure 5C), aswell differentiating between raw R. palmatum andcharred R. palmatum (Figure 5D). Ions a and d couldtherefore be used as chemical markers to discriminatebetween raw and processed R. palmatum (includingprepared R. palmatum and charred R. palmatum),whereas ions a and g could be used as the bestTable 2 Marker tR -m/z ion pairs of raw and processed RRaw DH/Processed DH Raw DH/ vinegar DH Raw DH/ winetR- m/z tR- m/z tR- m/zRaw DH 9.81-431.0988(a) Raw DH 9.81-431.0988(a) Raw DH 9.81-437.99-451.3296 7.99-451.3296 7.99-453.57-431.0861 3.57-431.0861 3.57-43ProcessedDH1.43- 331.0667(d) VinegarDH1.43-331.0667(d) Wine DH 1.43-339.71- 253.0499 7.33-477.1396(g) 7.33-4710.20-281.0814 8.60-283.0291 8.60-28Palmatum samples in the S-plot.aEmodin-8-O-glucoside, dGallic acid-3-O-glucoside,gCinnamyl-galloyl-glucoside derivative, hChrysophanol.characteristic markers to distinguish between raw R.palmatum and vinegar R. palmatum, as well as raw R.palmatum and wine R. palmatum.Preliminary study on processing mechanismAnthraquinone glycosides make a significant contribu-tion to the hepatic and renal toxicity of raw R. palma-tum. The Emodin-8-O-glucoside found in R. palmatum(ion a) has been reported to be reported to be exhibitthe highest levels of hepato- and nephrotoxicity of theanthraquinone glycoside found in R. palmatum, whereaschrysophanol (ion h) was reported to be the least toxicof these compounds [26].

This result may be related to theconversion of the anthraquinone glycosides in theR. palmatum samples into the corresponding freeanthraquinones in the processed materials. Theseresults provide a better explanation of the previousresults (Tables 2 and 3). The cinnamyl-galloyl-glucosidederivative (ion a) was determined to be the mostcharacteristic chemical marker for the identificationof raw R. palmatum, whereas chrysophanol (ion h)could be used as a potential chemical marker for theidentification of prepared and charred R. palmatumsamples.Raw R. palmatum exhibits a significant heat-clearingeffect and purgative activity, which is consistent with theproperties of bitter cold and sedimentation described inthe theory of TCM. The cinnamyl-galloyl-glucosidederivative (ion a) makes a significant contribution tothe purgative effects of R. palmatum. Consideration ofthe purgative effects of the different samples revealedthe following trend: raw R. palmatum > wine R. palma-tum ≈ vinegar R. palmatum > prepared R. palmatum >charred R. palmatum. A similar trend was also observedin the bitter cold properties of raw and processed R. pal-matum samples (Table 3). Gallic acid-3-O-glucoside (iond) made the greatest contribution to the convergenceeffect of R. palmatum. Consideration of the convergenceeffects of the different materials revealed the followingtrend: charred R. palmatum > prepared R. palmatum >vinegar R. palmatum ≈wine R. palmatum > raw R. pal-matum (Table 3).Previous studies have indicated that the basic compo-nents of raw R. palmatum are anthraquinone glycosidecompounds, and this information is in agreement withthe results of the current study (Tables 2 and 3). Fur-thermore, the chemical markers of raw and processed R.palmatum have been explored in considerable detail inthis study. The cinnamyl-galloyl-glucoside derivative wasdetermined to be the most characteristic marker in rawR. palmatum, whereas it appeared at a much lower levelTable 3 Toxicity, property and characteristic components of rToxic Raw DH Wine DHNephrotoxicity √ ↓Hepatotoxicity √ ↓Gastrointestinal reactions √ ↓The property of bitter cold √ ↓Characteristic components Aloe-emodin Cinnamyl-galloyl C-glucoside -glucoside↓: Reduced toxic effects.√: Toxic.or even disappeared completely in the prepared andcharred R. palmatum samples because the anthraquin-one glycosides were hydrolyzed to the correspondinganthraquinones during the processing stages, whichled to the loss of the purgative activities of these sam-ples and a decrease in their antipyretic effects. Further-more, the effect of promoting blood circulation toremove blood stasis increased. Gallic acid-3-O-glucosidewas identified as the most characteristic marker in thecharred and prepared R. palmatum samples, and theamount of this material increased significantly in thecharred and prepared R. palmatum samples comparedwith the raw material. This result could be attributed tothe tannins in the raw material being readily hydrolyzed toform gallic acid-3-O-glucoside by steaming with wine orby carbonization.ConclusionUPLC-QTOF-MS in conjunction with multivariatestatistical analysis can be used to screen and identifypotential chemical markers that could be used to dis-tinguish raw and processed R. palmatum. A variety ofdifferent R. palmatum samples were processed underthe same conditions and six ion pairs were identifiedas chemical markers that could be used to distinguishthe raw materials from that of the processed herbs.Two ions, namely those belonging to the emodin-8-O-glucoside and gallic acid-3-O-glucoside, were deter-mined to be potential chemical markers for processedR. palmatum. We have also provided a brief discussionof the underlying mechanisms associated responsiblefor enhancing the efficacy and reducing the toxicity ofR. palmatum following the traditional processingprocedures. The strategy developed in this study wassuccessfully applied to distinguish between samples ofraw from processed R. palmatum, and could also beused to investigate the mechanisms responsible for theefficacy enhancing and toxicity reducing effects ofcrude processing techniques in other materials.aw and processed DHVinegar DH Prepared DH Charred DH References↓ ↓ ↓ [16]↓ ↓ ↓ [16]↓ ↓ ↓ [17]↓ ↓ ↓ [17]innamyl-galloyl Gallic acid Gallic acid [16]-glucoside chrysophanol chrysophanol [17]Wang et al.
