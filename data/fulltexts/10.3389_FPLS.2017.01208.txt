The mechanism by which plants respond to alkali stress is not fullyunderstood, especially in plants having symbotic relationships such as alfalfa (Medicagosativa L.). Therefore, a study was designed to evaluate the metabolic response of theroot-nodule symbiosis in alfalfa under alkali stress using comparative metabolomics.Rhizobium-nodulized (RI group) and non-nodulized (NI group) alfalfa roots were treatedwith 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 and, roots samples were analyzed for malondialdehydyde(MDA), proline, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD)content. Additionally, metabolite profiling was conducted using gas chromatographycombined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS). Phenotypically, the RIalfalfa exhibited a greater resistance to alkali stress than the NI plants examined.Physiological analysis and metabolic profiling revealed that RI plants accumulatedmore antioxidants (SOD, POD, GSH), osmolytes (sugar, glycols, proline), organic acids(succinic acid, fumaric acid, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid), and metabolites that areinvolved in nitrogen fixation. Our pairwise metabolomics comparisons revealed that RIalfalfa plants exhibited a distinct metabolic profile associated with alkali putative tolerancerelative to NI alfalfa plants. Data provide new information about the relationship betweennon-nodulized, rhizobium-nodulized alfalfa and alkali resistance.Keywords: alfalfa, alkali stress, symbiotic rhizobium, metabolomics, GC-TOF/MSINTRODUCTIONAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is an important forage legume that is cultivated widely throughoutthe world (Chao et al., 2009). The USA is the largest producer of alfalfa ranking fourth behindcorn, wheat, and soybean among all cultivated crops (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2016). However, theworsening of the global environment and increasing soil salinization have diminished the qualityand yields of alfalfa grass (Wang et al., 2001).Soils may be salinized by neutral salts (NaCl and Na2SO4) or alkaline salts (NaHCO3 andNa2CO3), with the latter form causing alkali stress, which is particularly detrimental to plants(Yang et al., 2007). Injury caused by salt stress is often attributed to low water potential and ionSong et al. Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali Resistancetoxicity. Alkaline salts, in addition to imposing these two stresses,also cause high-pH stress (Yang et al., 2008b, 2009). High pHin the rhizosphere disrupts the physiological functions of theroot and under severe condition can even destroy the membranestructures of roots. High pH also disturbs the homeostasis ofvarious mineral ions. Hence, encompassing both salt and pHstressors, alkali stress effects tend to be more pronounced thanion poisoning or osmotic stress. The markedly lower tolerance ofplants to alkali (alkaline salt) stress than to salinity (neutral salt)stress has been reported (Yang et al., 2008a; Girvin, 2010; Wanget al., 2012).Many studies have studied the mechanisms of stress tolerancein model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, andLotus corniculatus L. Plants have evolved complex mechanismsinvolving a series of gene expression and gene productinteractions that enable them to adapt to abiotic stress at boththe cellular and molecular level (Jin et al., 2006). A number ofstress response genes have been identified in plants, includingion transporters, free radical scavengers, aquaporin ns, heat shockproteins, and late embryogenesis abundant proteins (Wang et al.,2003). Plants cope with alkali stress by regulating intracellularpH to re-establish ionic balance and by adjusting the pH of theirrhizospheres, which is costly in terms of energy and resources(Guo et al., 2015).Medicago truncatula is a model or reference species for legumegenetics, genomics, and breeding. Examination of plant salt stressresponses in the Medicago truncatula have focused primarily onbasal metabolism, photosynthesis, ion content changes under saltstress, and salt tolerance gene cloning and transformation (Zhuoet al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014). Salt resistance isalso being investigated in alfalfa with high-throughput genomesequencing and multiple-omics strategies (i.e., transcriptomics,proteomics and metabolomics) (Alvarez et al., 2008; Guo et al.,2015). Such studies have screened for differentially expressedgenes, proteins, and metabolites with the aim of elucidating thephysiological and molecular mechanisms of salt stress responsesin alfalfa.It is reasonable to hypothesize that many aspects ofplant responses to alkali stress would be similar to salinitystress responses, such as ion transportation, osmotic soluteaccumulation, photosynthesis, and hormone synthesis (Guoet al., 2015). Metabolic solutes, such as proline, betaine, solublesugar, polyamine, and polyols, have been shown to exhibitmarked changes under salt stress, making them likely potentialmediators of plant resistance to alkali stress (Munns and Tester,2008; Guo et al., 2015). Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms bywhich plants respond to alkali stress are largely unknown andalkali-related metabolomics information remains limited.The alfalfa can establish symbiosis with Rhizobium microbes,a family of gram-negative bacteria that are commonly foundin soils (Denison and Kiers, 2011). In the presence of rhizobia,alfalfa roots undergo nodulation, establishing a symbioticpartnership wherein plants provide photosynthate and carbonresources to the rhizobia (Jones et al., 2007). In return, thenodulated rhizobia conduct nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase,thereby providing plants with usable nitrogen. In agriculture,Rhizobium nodulation not only reduces the need for nitrogenfertilizer, but can also improve the host plant’s resistance toadverse conditions (Antolín and Sánchez-Díaz, 1992; Figueiredoet al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016b). Photosynthatesare transported through the phloem to the nodule wheresugar molecules are converted into dicarboxylic acid, mainlyin the form of malic acid and succinic acid salt (Poynardet al., 2003). There are many intermediate metabolites duringthis symbiotic process, such as soluble polysaccharides, organicacids, and amino acids, which play positive roles in plant’sregulation of cell osmotic pressure, pH balance, and reactiveoxygen species (ROS) removal. Under adverse conditions, othernodule functions in nitrogen-fixing (i.e., carbohydrate utilization,nitrogen-containing compound accumulation, O2 permeability,and ROS accumulation) are inhibited (Arrese-Igor, 1999; Nayaand Becana, 2007; Becana et al., 2010; Aranjuelo et al., 2011,2013). Although nitrogen fixation in alfalfa and stress resistancein both alfalfa and rhizobia have been intensively studied, themechanism through which rhizobia-alfalfa symbiosis supportsalkali stress tolerance is unclear.Therefore, the aim is to demonstrate the possible differencebetween NI and RI group under alkali stress in physiologyand metabolic level, then deduce the response mechanismsof nodulized alfalfa under alkali stress at physiologicaland metabolomics levels. First, we compared alkali stressresistance between nodulized and non-nodulized alfalfa plantsin physiologic level, and, then assayed nodule metabolitesusing gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight massspectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) analysis to explore the mechanismsof nodule symbiosis in alkali resistance in metabolic level. Ourstudy identified many important metabolites and metabolicpathways that participate in alkali resistance in alfalfa. Basedon the results, we could deduce the key enzymes and genesin the enriched metabolic pathway. These results combinedwith physiological and metabolic level, contributes to a betterunderstanding of the relationship between root-symbioticrhizobia and alkali resistance.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Materials and Alkali TreatmentMedicago sativa (Longmu 806) seeds were surface-sterilizedwith 75% ethanol for 15 s and 10% sodium hypochlorite for 5min, and then rinsed thoroughly four or five times with sterilewater. The seeds were germinated on wet filter paper in Petridishes in a light growth chamber (light 24◦C/dark 18◦C, 16h/8 h) and kept moist during the germination period (relativehumidity, 60%). After germinating for 5 d, the normal plantswere transplanted directly into a culture pot of sandy soil;nodule plants were transplanted into the sand culture bowlafter inoculation with rhizobia inoculation nodules. Each traywas loaded with 24 pots, and each pot held three plants (H14cm × D 13 cm). The plants were maintained in a greenhousefor 12 weeks (with 30◦C/25◦C day/night temperatures, 16h of light and 40% relative humidity. Plants were irrigatedtwice weekly with different nutrient solutions for NI and RIsamples. Normal plants were watered with 1/5 Hoagland nutrientsolution. Plants with symbiotic rhizobium were watered withFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al. Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali Resistance1/5 Hoagland nutrient solution for the first 8 weeks andthen 1/5 nitrogen-free nutrient solution for the subsequent 4weeks to trigger nodule activation. After 12 weeks, controlnormal plants and control inoculating rhizobia alfalfa plantswere maintained with 1/5 Hoagland nutrient solution and 1/5nitrogen-free nutrient solution, respectively. Meanwhile, treatedplants were submersed in the nutrient solution supplementedwith 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 (Zhu et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2015).The treatment continued for 8 d, root tissues were collected onday 0 and day 6 after administration of alkali treatment. Rootswere harvested by briefly rinsing away sand and dissecting outall of the root tissues (including nodules). The harvested rootsamples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Treated and controlplants were harvested at the same time. Twelve plants in eachgroup (alkali stress and control group for each time point andeach accession) served as the sample sources for detection ofphysiological compound; six plants from each time point servedas the sample sources for metabolite extraction and metaboliteprofiling analysis.Detection of Physiological IndicesMalondialdehyde (MDA) content was determined according toa modified thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method (Puckette et al.,2007). Root tissue samples (200 mg) were homogenized in 5mL of 0.1% (w/v) TCA, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min.Four milliliters of TCA (20%)/TBA (0.5%) solution was to a 1-ml aliquot of the supernatent. The mixture was heated to 100◦Cfor 15 min, cooled on ice, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for10 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 450,532, and 600 nm. MDA concentration served as an index of lipidperoxidation.Proline content was measured by the sulfosalicylic acidreaction method as described (Wang et al., 2016a). Roottissue samples were each homogenized in 10 mL of 3% (w/v)sulfosalicylic acid, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000× g for 20 min. Two milliliters of the supernatant was mixedwith 2 mL of glacial acetic acid and 2 mL of acidic ninhydrinreagent, and then boiled for 40 min. The tubes were cooled, 5mL of toluene was added to each tube, and absorbance at 520 nmwas determined.Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by thenitroblue tetrazoliun (NBT) method (Giannopolitis and Ries,1977; Yang et al., 2013). One unit of SOD activity was definedas the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reductionrate of NBT by 50%. Peroxidase (POD) activity was measuredby determining the oxidation rate of guaiacol (1-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzene, C7H8O2) substrate per minute (Yang et al.,2013).Glutathione (GSH) reduction was assessed fluorometrically(Hissin and Hilf, 1976). Root samples were ground in 3 mLof 5% H3PO3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The reaction mixture (3 mL), containing 2.6mL of 150 mM PBS (pH 7.0), 0.2 mL of 0.1 mM dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and 0.2 mL of supernatant, wasincubated at 30◦C for 5 min and absorbance at 412 nm wasrecorded.Metabolite Extraction and MetaboliteProfiling AnalysisThe GC-MS was performed as described by Lisec et al. (2006).Briefly, 0.05 g aliquots of each sample were placed in 2-ml EPtubes. Metabolites were extracted from each tube with 0.4 mlof methanol-water (v/v = 3:1); 20 µl of Adonitol (0.2 mg/mlstock in ddH2O) was added as an internal standard. The mixturewas vortexed for 30 s, homogenized in a ball mill for 3 minat 65 Hz, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at4◦C. The resultant supernatant (∼0.35 ml) was transferred toa new 2-ml GC/MS glass vial; equal volumes of each sample(14 µl) were combined in a separate 2-ml GC/MS glass vial toserve as a mixed sample for quality control. The extracts weredried in a vacuum concentrator (37◦C) for 2 h, and then 40µlof methoxylamine hydrochloride (dissolved in pyridine, finalconcentration of 20 mg/ml) was added to each dried metabolitesample. The extracts were incubated at 80◦C for 20 min in anoven after mixing and sealing. The lid of each tube was openedand 50 µl of BSTFA (containing 1% TCMS, v/v) was added toeach sample, and then the tubes were re-sealed and incubated for1 h at 70◦C. Subsequently, 5 µl of FAMEs (standard mixture offatty acid methyl esters, C8–C16: 1 mg/ml; C18–C24: 0.5 mg/mlin chloroform) was added to each mixed sample. The sampleswere allowed to cool to room temperature, and then mixed wellin preparation for GC-TOF-MS analysis.GC-TOF-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 7890 gaschromatograph system (Agilent, USA) coupled with a PegasusHT time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The system utilized a Rxi-5Sil MS column (30m × 250 µm inner diameter, 0.25 µmfilm thickness; Restek, USA). A 1-µL aliquot of the analytewas injected in splitless mode. Helium was used as the carriergas, the front inlet purge flow was 3mL·min−1, and the gasflow rate through the column was 1 mL·min−1. The initialtemperature was kept at 50◦C for 1 min, raised to 330◦C at arate of 10◦C·min−1, and then kept for 5 min at 330◦C. Theinjection, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were 280◦C,280◦C, and 250◦C, respectively. The energy level applied was−70eV (electron impact mode). The mass spectrometry data wereacquired in full-scan mode with an m/z range of 30–600 at a rateof 20 spectra/s after a solvent delay of 366 s.Chroma TOF4.3X software (LECO Corporation) and theLECO-Fiehn Rtx5 database were used for raw peak extraction,data baseline filtering, baseline calibration, peak alignment,deconvolution analysis, peak identification, and integration ofthe peak area. The retention time index method was usedfor peak identification, and the retention time index tolerancewas 5,000. For the GC-Quad FiehnLib library, derivatives wereidentified by increasing numbers according to retention index(e.g., serine 1, serine 2, and serine 3) for derivatives with one ortwo trimethylsilyl groups in the primary amino group a (Sumneret al., 2007; Kind et al., 2009; Creek et al., 2014).Data Analysis and Metabolic PathwayConstructionDetermination of physiological indices were statistically analyzedusing SPSS20.0. To reveal significant differences, the data wereFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al. Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali Resistancesubjected to analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and the leastsignificant differences (LSDs) of means were determined withDuncan’s test (significance criterion, α = 0.05).The resulting three-dimensional data, including peak number,sample name, and normalized data were imported intoSIMCA software (V14, Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden), principalcomponent analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latentstructure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were testedfor all samples. The OPLS-DA model was employed withfirst principal-component of VIP (variable importance in theprojection) values (VIP > 1) combined with Student’s T-test(T-test) (P < 0.05) to find differentially accumulated/depletedmetabolites; non-commercial databases, including KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and NIST (http://www.nist.gov/index.html), were searched for metabolite pathways. Quantitativenormalization within replicates were subjected to logarithmicbase 2 transformation. MetaboAnalyst online analysis software(www.metaboanalyst.ca/) was used to build heatmap diagrams(Xia andWishart, 2011). Metabolomics data have been depositedto the EMBL-EBI MetaboLights database (Haug et al., 2013) withthe identifier MTBLS481. The complete dataset can be accessedhere http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS481.RESULTSPhenotype of Alfalfa under Alkali StressFour days after the 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 treatment, leaves ofalfalfa plants in the NI (no rhizobium inoculation) conditionstarted to wilt and turned yellow, while no apparent damagewas observed in the RI (nodulized with rhizobium) group(Figure 1B). Six days after treatment, the growth of plantsin both groups was suppressed with the leaves of NI plantsexhibiting serious wilting, while old leaves on RI plants begunto show some wilting (Figure 1C). Eight days after treatment, NIplants were dying while RI plants showed only limited damage(Figure 1D). The results above showed that phenotypically,rhizobium nodulation alleviated the damage induced by alkalistress and increased alkali tolerance in alfalfa (Figure 1).Physiological Changes in Alfalfa Rootunder Alkali StressNo obvious morphologic differences were found among RI whenexposed to 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 treatments for 4 days, whilethe plants were seriously hampered and grew abnormally whenexposed to 6 days after treatment. Therefore, we selected the plantof 6 days after treatment for the physiological and metabolomicsanalysis. Levels of the membrane lipid peroxidation end productand damage marker malondialdehydyde (MDA) in NI and RIgroups were similar before the 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 treatment(Figure 2A). Six days after 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 treatment,MDA levels were increased in both NI and RI groups, with levelsbeing 1.45-fold higher in the NI group than in the RI group(p < 0.05), indicating that NI plants suffered more damage thanRI plants.The level of proline was 4.34-fold higher in the RI groupthan that in NI group (p < 0.005) even before the alkalitreatment (Figure 2B). Six days after 200 mmol/L NaHCO3FIGURE 1 | Phenotype of alfalfa plants with or without rhizobium inoculation before and after NaHCO3 treatment.

Relativeto that in the NI group, SOD activity levels in the RI group was1.76-fold higher before the alkali stress treatment and 1.69-foldhigher 6 days after alkali treatment (both p < 0.05) (Figure 2C).SOD activity levels in the NI group did not differ significantlybefore vs. 6 days after treatment. POD activity in the RI groupwas 3.7-fold higher than that in the NI group before treatment.POD activity in RI decreased 6 days post treatment (p <0.05 vs. pretreatment), but remained slightly higher than NI,although not statistically significant (Figure 2D). Taken together,these data indicate that alfalfa plants in RI group had higherantioxidant activity than plants in the NI group.Similar to SOD and POD, Glutathione (GSH) content was1.79-fold higher in RI than in NI (p < 0.05) before alkalitreatment (Figure 2E). However, unlike SOD and POD levels,GSH content in the RI group was lower than that in NIplants after 6 days of alkali treatment (p < 0.05).

Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali Resistancealkali treatment indicate that rhizobium nodulation induces theirexpression.Metabolic ProfilingTo reveal the physiological responses and adaptive strategiesof alfalfa to alkali stress, metabolic changes in NI and RIroots subjected to alkali treatment were assessed throughGC/TOF-MS analysis. GC/TOF-MS analysis revealed an obviouschromatographic difference between the NI and RI groups.Using the interquartile range denoising method, we identified483 metabolites from a total of 483 detected peaks. Then,missing values in the raw dataset were filled by half ofthe minimum value and the internal standard normalizationmethod was applied. The resultant three-dimensional data,including peak numbers, sample names, and normalized peakareas, were entered into SIMCA14 software (Umetrics, Umea,Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonalprojections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA)(Figures 3A–D, 4A–D). A PCA analysis score plot showed thedistributions of the origin data and the samples were separatedaccordingly. However, the application of multivariate analysisOPLS-DA could be better to separate control from alkali stresssamples and also separate no-rhizobium inoculation (NI) fromrhizobium inoculation (RI) samples. The altered metaboliteswere found from the line plots of the X-loadings of the firstcomponent of the PLS-DA pairwise comparison models. And,the parameters for the classification indicated good predictabilityand goodness of fit (Figure S1). The variable importance in theprojection (VIP) values greater than 1 and p-values lower 0.05were considered the most relevant metabolites in response toalkali stress or symbiotic rhizobia.Metabolic Changes in Response to NIControl, NI 6 d after Alkali TreatmentA significant variance (VIP > 1, p < 0.05) in the metabolicprofiles between NI control (A) and NI alkali treatment (A1)was observed and a total of 83 metabolites with significantdifferences were identified (Figure 5A). The 83 metabolites thatwere identified as differing between NI control and NI alkalistress, included carbohydrates, amines, organic acids, otherpolar molecules, and unidentified substances. Metabolites thatshowed a more than 15-fold difference (as calculated by theformula:log(A1/A)2 ) before vs. after alkali treatment includedmelibiose (−18.00-fold), glucosaminic acid (−18.18-fold), 3-phenylcatechol (21.62-fold), and linoleic acid methyl ester(−24.13-fold); those with changes in the 5–15-fold rangedincluded galactinol (−5.22-fold), 1,5-anhydroglucitol (5.18-fold), and guanine (−6.46-fold). The rest of the metabolitesexamined, including various carbohydrates, amino acids, andorganic acids, showed changes in the 1–5-fold range (Table 1and Table S1). Heat map analysis showed the metabolitesthat exhibited significant changes in NI plants after alkaliFIGURE 3 | Principal component analysis (PCA) score plots of metabolic profiles in alfalfa roots under the alkali stress.

Notably, osmolytes, such as proline, showed alkali-stressinduced increases, furthermore, increases in A-ketoglutarate andsuccinate, suggest up-regulation of the citric acid cycle (TCA).Meanwhile, the levels of some carbohydrates and organic aminesubstances were decreased in response to alkali stress (Figure 5Band Table 1).Metabolic Changes in Response to RIControl, RI 6 d after Alkali TreatmentAs shown, 59 metabolites differed significantly betweenRI control (B) and RI alkali treatment (B1), includingcarbohydrates, amines, lipids, organic acids, other polarmolecules, and unidentified molecules (Figure 5C). Metabolitesthat showed greater than 15-fold changes (as calculated by theformula:log(B1/B)2 ) before vs. after the alkali treatment included4-acetamidobutyric acid (−20.48-fold), and aminooxyaceticacid (19.03-fold). Metabolites showing differences between 1-and 5-fold included maltose (−3.51-fold), glucose (−1.22-fold),L-threose (3.36-fold-fold), threonine (−2.17-fold), putrescine(−1.72-fold), succinic acid (1.77-fold), fumaric acid (1.39-fold),threonic acid (2.58-fold), galactonic acid (−1.33-fold), and1,3-diaminopropane (1.11-fold), among others (Table 1 andTable S1). Heat mapping showed distinct alkali-stress inducedmetabolite profile changes in the RI group relative to that in theNI group. Specifically, in the RI group, the alkali stress treatmentresulted in more organic acid changes, such as, increases inA-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate, as well as and notableincreases in the amino acid biosynthesis precursors. (Figure 5Dand Table 1).Differences between NI and RI Rootswithout Alkali TreatmentFifty eight metabolite differences were identified between theNI and RI groups under normal conditions (Figure 6A).Metabolites with a greater than a 15-fold (as calculated bythe formula:log(B1/A1)2 ) difference between NI and RI includedtrehalose (−21.61-fold), 6-deoxy-D-glucose (16.96-fold), andnaringin (−18.49-fold); only 1,5-anhydroglucitol (5.58-fold) hada difference in the 5- to 15-fold range. Noticeably, manyorganic acids and amines were 1- to 5-fold higher in NI plantsthan in RI plants (p < 0.05), including succinic acid (−1.50-fold), fumaric acid (−1.06-fold), threonic acid (−3.42-fold), A-ketoglutaric acid (−1.42-fold), oxalic acid (−1.19-fold), glycine(−1.34-fold), alanine (−1.59-fold), urea (−1.41-fold), 1,3-diaminopropane (−1.27-fold), and methionine (−1.69-fold)(Table 1 and Table S1). Heat maps revealed distinctly differentmetabolite profiles for the NI and RI groups, even before thealkali stress treatment. Organic acids in the TCA cycle and mostamines and carbohydrates were higher in NI than in RI plants(Figure 6B and Table 1).Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al.

Among these metabolites, only 13definite substances with fold < −1 (fold was calculated by theformula:log(B1/A1)2 ) were screened, while 9 definite metaboliteswere fold >1. Other substances were indefinite or unknown.Only two definite metabolites with a greater than a 5-foldwere found between NI and RI under alkali treatment, guanine(6.33-fold) and 3-phenylcatechol (−7.39-fold).

Trehalose concentrations betweenthe RI-and NI-control were most different (21.61-fold, fold= log(NI/RI)2 ). The altered metabolites involved in the primarymetabolism of glycolysis and citric acid cycle and the linkingmetabolites to amino acid synthesis in alfalfa roots under alkalistress are summarized on a simplified metabolic map (Figure 8).A schematized summary of some metabolomics variationsobserved between NI and RI, with or without treatment,indicated by pairwise comparisons is provided in Figure 8.Among the 20 metabolites that were differentially regulatedamong four pairwise comparisons, 3 were significantly differentin all three comparisons, namely threonic acid, succinate, andα-ketoglutaric acid, all of which are related to amino acidmetabolism and the TCA cycle.DISCUSSIONSoil salinization–alkalization is one of the most seriousenvironmental factors limit crop growth and yield (Peng et al.,2008). A better understanding of how plants cope with salt-alkalistress at the molecular and metabolic levels is required. In thisstudy, we found that rhizobium symbiosis enhances alfalfa’sresistance to alkaline stress (Figures 1, 2). A metabolomic studyalso revealed that a distinct metabolic profile is induced innodulized vs. non-nodulized alfalfa (Figures 4, 5).Phenotypic and Physiological Differencesbetween NI and RI under Alkali StressAfter alkali stress, alfalfa inoculated with rhizobium (RI group)showed a more resistant phenotype than non-inoculated plants(NI group). MDA content, was higher in NI than RI plants,suggesting that alkali stress-induced damage in the RI group wasless than that in the NI group. On the other hand, proline wasfound at higher levels in RI plants than in NI plants. Prolineis induced for protective purposes under stress conditions, suchas drought and elevated salinity (Liu and Zhu, 1997; Delauneyand Verma, 2002; Tang et al., 2014). High proline content mayattenuate damage caused by osmotic stress in alkali stress.In abiotic stress conditions, oxygen is converted to ROS, andhigh levels of ROS are cytotoxic (Lu et al., 2013). Under salinitystress conditions, plants increase their antioxidant levels andFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al.

Our study showed that the enzymaticactivity of SOD and POD in RI plants was higher than that in NIplants, indicating that the former had a greater ROS-scavengingability. Non-enzymatic GSH, which is an important water-soluble antioxidant and ROS scavenger, can reduce some ROSdirectly, thereby alleviating cellular damage due to membranelipid peroxidization. High GSH levels increased plants’ toleranceto stress and that increased GSH synthesis is an endogenousresponse to environmental stress (Cheng et al., 2015). However,we found that GSH was decreased greatly in RI plants 6 days afterthe alkali stress treatment. It is possible that GSH biosynthesiswas hindered while available GSH was occupied with scavengingROS, which is consistent with the results of Zeng and Wang(1990). Taken collectively, our analysis suggests that RI plantshave a greater ROS-scavenging and oxidative stress-reducingcapacity than NI plants.Effects of Rhizobium Nodulation onMetabolic ProfileMetabolites, which are the end products of all cellular processesand the basis for phenotype expression, can in turn affect genetranscription and protein expression. In this study, GC-TOF/MScomparative analysis was employed to identify metabolitesand pathways that change after Rhizobium inoculation. Heatmap analyses revealed metabolites with pronounced changes inassociation with nodulization. The substances with the mostdramatic change included trehalose (decreased, −21.6-fold), 6-deoxy-D-glucose (increased, 16.9-fold), and naringin (increased,−18.5-fold). Trehalose, which is found across diverse organisms,including bacteria, yeast, and invertebrate animals (Arguelles,2000; Chen et al., 2002), protects membranes and proteinsfrom dehydration- and oxidation-induced damage (Rudolphand Crowe, 1985; Colaco et al., 1992). The presently observeddecrease in trehalose and melibiose, following nodulation mightFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al. Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali ResistanceFIGURE 8 | Metabolic changes involved in the primary pathways of alfalfa roots under alkali treatment.

NI alkali-treated/NI Control (A1/A); RI alkali-treated/RI Control (B1/B), RI Control/NI Control (B/A),RI alkali-treated/NI alkali-treated (B1/A1).be due to the conversion of these sugars to other sugar forms(e.g., glucose, galactose, and sucrose) to provide rhizobia withenergy and carbon sources. Indeed, it has been mentionedin previous studies that trehalose is higher in symbionts(Müller et al., 1995). Other studies have shown that differentspecies of nodule symbiosis differ in trehalose content. Inthis experiment, we observed lower trehalose content in theinoculated root than in normal plants; this contradiction isworthy of further study to determine the reason underlyingthis difference. However, as shown in Table 1, trehalose contentincreased more than 20-fold in the rhizobium-treated plantsafter 6 d of alkali stress treatment, while no such changeswere observed in the non-inoculated nodulation plants. Theseresults indicate that trehalose may be affected by alkali stressin plants with root nodule symbiosis plants. However, theexisting datas could not explain this contradiction, the result wasworth exploring. Sugar level changes in plants are not passiveresponses to stress, but rather consequent to active metabolicprocesses of adaption to high-pH and alkali stress (Guo et al.,2015).Increases in amino acids, such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid,and oxoproline, might be directly related to nitrogen fixation.Organic acids serve as reductants to both the Nase complex andthe respiratory chain that fuels Nase with the ATP necessary fornitrogen fixation (Kouchi and Tadakatsu, 1986; Streeter, 1987).Our observations of decreased levels of organic acids, such assuccinic acid, fumaric acid, threonic acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid,oxalacetic acid, and oxalic acid, in RI roots might be due toorganic acid biosynthesis being down-regulated in response toincreased root secretion of organic acids. Meanwhile, increasedorganic acids secretion makes the rhizosphere surroundingthe root more acidic, which can neutralize alkaline salts. Itis not clear why naringin levels were decreased followinginoculation.Similarities and Differences between NIand RI Alfalfa in Alkaline ToleranceMetabolome analysis findings indicated that the metaboliteprofiles of alkali-stressed NI and RI plants consisted mainlyof changes in organic acid content. The accumulation oflow-molecular-weight metabolites (a.k.a compatible substances)help plant cells maintain osmotic homeostasis between theircytoplasm and the environment, thus protecting normal cellularfunction (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005; Umezawa et al., 2006).These metabolites included nitrogen containing compounds(proline, arginine, other amino acids, quaternary ammoniumcompounds, and polyamines) and polyhydroxy compoundsFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 12 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1208Song et al. Nodule Symbiosis in Alkali Resistance(sucrose, oligosaccharides, and polyhydric alcohols) (Bohnertet al., 1995; Hare et al., 1998).It is notable that 4-acetamidobutyric acid, a precursor of 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) decreased in both NI and RI plantsin response to alkali stress. In plants, GABA is a stress responsemarker and plays an important role in both nitrogen andcarbohydrate metabolism (Bouche and Fromm, 2004). The TCAcycle can engage in GABA shunting wherein various pathwaysbypass GABA (Fait et al., 2008). Levels of the osmoprotectantproline increase greatly after drought and salinity stress (Yang,2012; Wang et al., 2016b). In NI plants, this increase in proline isaccompanied by a significant decrease in GABA, suggesting thatGABA is converted into proline to increase resistance to osmoticstress. However, in our RI group, proline levels were increasedonly very slightly. So, the distribution of metabolites was differentbetween NI and RI groups after alkali stress, ultimately, themechanism responding to alkali stress was distinctive.Meanwhile, the increased levels of aminooxyacetic acid (AOA;an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor) levels detected, after alkalistress suggest that ethylene biosynthesis was inhibited to increasealfalfa’s tolerance to alkali stress. Experimental inhibition ofethylene biosynthesis increases plants’ resistance to drought(Dezar et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2011), salinity (Achard et al., 2006;Lei et al., 2011), and cold (Shi et al., 2012). On the other hand,augmentation of ethylene content in wild Arabidopsis plants withan ethylene biosynthesis precursor (i.e., 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) enhanced resistance to high salinity conditionsand survival (Cao et al., 2007). Thus, although ethylene appears tosomehow be linked to stress responses in plants, the mechanismsof this linkage are unknown. Moreover, the influence of ethyleneon stress resistance may differ across genera.The differing metabolite shifts observed following alkali stresstreatment in NI plants vs. RI plants in our study suggestthat these two groups may have undergone different resistancemechanisms. We hypothesize that the increased organic acidproduction in RI plants may reflect adaptive strategies formaintenance of cellular homeostasis. Organic acid accumulationin vacuoles affects cellular pH and reduces excessive cations(Shi and Zhao, 1997; Yang et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2013). Thepronounced accumulation of secondary metabolites in severelywilting and growth-stunted NI plants 6 days after the alkali stresstreatment may be due to the degradation of macromolecules.Plants absorb NO−3 from soil, which is converted into NO−2by nitrate reductase. The NO−2 is then converted into NH+4 bynitrite reductase. The NO−3 content in alfalfa and wheat rootsis near zero under alkali stress (Wang et al., 2012; Guo et al.,2015). The enzyme activities of nitrate reductase and glutaminesynthetase, which are induced by NO−3 , decrease in the absence ofNO−3 . Consequently, amino acid biosynthesis is inhibited, whichin turn affects almost all aspects of metabolism. Hence, greatlyreduced NO−3 content in NI plants may have affected a variety ofmetabolism processes. It is our view that the symbiotic nodulesin RI plants may have compensated for reduced NO−3 , therebyreducing damage and conferring enhanced resistance.Taken collectively, our data indicate that Rhizobium symbiosisincreases alfalfa’s resistance to alkali stress. The physiologicmechanisms of enhanced resistance may be associated withincreased antioxidant activity (via MDA, POD, SOD, and GSH),enhanced production of organic acids, and accumulation ofosmolytes such as proline. In metabolomics levels, differentmetabolites were enriched in TCA cycle (citric acid cycle),alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and galactosemetabolism for four pair-comparition groups. However,the metabolites were not identical and varied in differentcomparisons groups. RI and NI groups had different distributionof metabolites, and distinctive response after alkali stress.For RI group, the accumulation of organic acids, aminoacids and secondary metabolites in the process of C-Ntransformation had played a positive role in promoting alkaliresistance.FUNDINGThis research was supported by grants from the Project of theNational Natural Science Foundation of China (No.31302022),and the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(No.C2015018).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSHC and GC contributed to the conception of the study.
