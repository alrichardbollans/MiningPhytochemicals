ABSTRACT: Through site-directed mutagenesis targeted at
identiﬁcation of the catalytic base in the rice (Oryza sativa) syn-
copalyl diphosphate synthase OsCPS4, changes to a single
residue (H501) were found to induce rearrangement rather than
immediate deprotonation of the initially formed bicycle, leading
to production of the novel compound syn-halimadienyl
diphosphate. These mutational results are combined with
quantum chemical calculations to provide insight into the
underlying reaction mechanism.
Labdane-related diterpenoids are a large and structurallyvaried set of natural products, and over 7000 of these
compounds are known.1 These natural products are uniﬁed by
their biosynthetic origins, particularly their characteristic trans-
decalin core ring structure, which is formed by class II
diterpene cyclases (DTCs). These enzymes catalyze proto-
nation-initiated (bi)cyclization of the general diterpene
precursor, (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, 1),
with direct deprotonation of the resulting labda-13E-en-8-yl+
intermediate at the C8 methyl substituent yielding copalyl
diphosphate (CPP). There are four stereoisomers of CPP
depending on the prochiral conformation 1 is folded into
before bicyclization occurs. One such stereoisomer is termed
syn-CPP (2) (9R,10S), as it is formed from a pro-chair-boat
conﬁguration of 1 that leads to syn orientation of the C-9
hydrogen and C-10 methyl substituents (Scheme 1).1
While all vascular plants contain a DTC to produce the ent-
CPP (9R,10R) required for gibberellin phytohormone biosyn-
thesis,2 the only plant CPP synthase (CPS) shown to catalyze
formation of 2 is OsCPS4.3 This CPS is involved in the
production of more specialized labdane-related diterpenoids
(i.e., secondary metabolites), such as the allelochemical
momilactones4,5 and antifungal phytoalexins.6 Nevertheless,
OsCPS4 is phylogenetically related to the ent-CPP producing
plant CPSs from in gibberellin biosynthesis.3 Thus, inves-
tigation of OsCPS4 represents an opportunity to investigate the
enzymatic structure−function relationships underlying its
conversion to production of the stereochemically diﬀerentiated
syn-CPP (2), as well as DTC catalysis more generally.
The DTCs utilize a general acid−base catalytic mechanism,
initiating bicyclization by protonating the terminal carbon−
carbon double bond (CC) of 1. This triggers a carbocation
cascade, with sequential anti addition from the two internal
CC leading to the bicyclic intermediate labda-13E-en-8-yl+,
which can be rearranged by sequential 1,2-shifts of hydride and
methyl groups, with the C10 → C9 methyl migration forming
the halimadane skeletal structure and subsequent C4 → C5
methyl migration forming the clerodane backbone (Scheme
S1).1 The ﬁnal carbocation seems to be invariably quenched by
deprotonation, although this may be preceded by the addition
of water, resulting in a hydroxylated product. Notably, while
DTCs/CPSs are characterized by a highly conserved
(D,E)xDD motif from which the middle aspartic acid acts as
the catalytic acid,7 the catalytic base does not appear to be
nearly as well conserved. This may be due in part to variation in

positioning of the base, relative to the acid, underlying the
production of diﬀerent (stereo)-isomers of CPP, as well as the
addition of water and/or rearrangement, by various DTCs.
The catalytic base for the plant CPSs involved in gibberellin
phytohormone biosynthesis has been recently identiﬁed as
dependent on a histidine-asparagine dyad that is speciﬁcally
conserved in these ent-CPP producing DTCs.8 By contrast, the
catalytic base in the DTC active site of the diterpene synthases
involved in conifer resin acid biosynthesis has been identiﬁed as
a very similarly positioned tyrosine-histidine dyad, which is
speciﬁcally conserved in these normal CPP (9S,10S) producing
enzymes.9,10 In both cases, alanine substitution for the
histidines leads to the addition of water, with the mutant
DTCs yielding hydroxylated derivatives of CPP.8,9
Consistent with its closer phylogenetic relationship to other
CPSs, OsCPS4 contains the histidine (H251) of the CPS
catalytic base dyad, although the other position is a cysteine
(C310) instead of asparagine. However, alanine substitution for
this histidine did not eliminate activity, nor alter product
outcome, with expression of the OsCPS4:H251A mutant in E.
coli engineered to produce 1 via a modular metabolic
engineering system11 still leading to the exclusive production
of 2 (Figure S1). Similarly, alanine substitution for the cysteine
also does not signiﬁcantly alter activity (i.e., OsCPS4:C310A
also produces 2, Figure S1). In addition, while substitution of
aspartate for the catalytic histidine in the DTC active site of the
diterpene synthases involved in conifer resin acid biosynthesis
also leads to incorporation of water,9 such substitution in
OsCPS4 simply reduces catalytic activity (i.e., OsCPS4:H251D
produces only trace amounts of 2, Figure S1). Accordingly,
OsCPS4 appears to use a novel general base, consistent with
the unique stereochemistry of its product.
The identity of the catalytic base in OsCPS4 was further
investigated by protein structure modeling. A model was
constructed on the basis of the most closely related known
crystal structure, that of the CPS from Arabidopsis thaliana
(AtCPS),12,13 using the SWISS-MODEL server.14−17 The
previously identiﬁed catalytic base groups both include
histidines, which were found across the active site from the
DxDD motif. In addition to H251, two other similarly
positioned histidines (H275 and H501) are present in the
modeled OsCPS4 active site (Figure 1A).
Notably, while substitution of either alanine or aspartate for
H275 did not alter product outcome, and only slightly reduced
overall yield (Figure S2), such substitutions for H501 had a
clear eﬀect (Figure 2A−C). The OsCPS4:H501A mutant was
found to exhibit both reduced yield and a mixture of 2 with an
unidentiﬁed product whose mass spectra indicated that it was
not a hydroxylated version of 2 (i.e., from incorporation of
water), as the molecular weight of the dephosphorylated
derivative appeared to be 290 (equivalent to that for 2; Figure
2D). With the OsCPS4:H501D mutant, although 2 is still
observed and the overall yield lags that observed with the wild-
type enzyme (i.e., substantial amounts of 1 are still present),
this compound was produced in much higher amounts,
enabling puriﬁcation and structural analysis of the dephos-
phorylated derivative by NMR (Table S1, Figures S3−S5). The
compound was found to be a halima-5,13E-dien-15-ol whose
stereochemical conﬁguration indicates its derivation from
rearrangement of syn-labda-13E-en-8-yl+ (A, for structure see
Scheme 1). Accordingly, the enzymatic product is termed here
syn-halima-5,13E-dienyl diphosphate (syn-HPP, 3). Given that
substitution of phenylalanine and, especially, tyrosine for the
catalytic histidine in AtCPS has recently been shown to result
in product rearrangement,19 analogous mutants were con-
structed for OsCPS4. Strikingly, these had contrasting eﬀects,
with phenylalanine substitution exhibiting the expected
production of 3, with improved yield relative to the aspartate
mutant (both overall and as an increased proportion of the
product mix), while tyrosine substitution does not alter the
production of 2, which is observed in good yield, with very little
1 left (Figure 2E and F).
Interestingly, H501 occupies a position that is otherwise
invariably conserved as a tyrosine in plant DTCs, highlighting
its functional role in the stereochemically unique reaction
catalyzed by OsCPS4. By contrast, the position occupied by
H275 is more variable. While this residue is generally an
(iso)leucine in most plant DTCs, histidine can be found at this
position in other closely related CPSs that produce diﬀerent
stereoisomers of CPP (Figure 1B), both the ent-CPP producing

OsCPS2 from rice20 and the normal CPP producing TaCPS2
from wheat (Triticum aestivum).21 However, although it is
possible that H501 acts as the catalytic base, the observed
mixture of eﬀects on product outcome from various
substitutions diﬀers from those previously observed for the
catalytic bases in other DTCs,8,9,19 which seems to preclude
clear assignment of the role H501 plays in shaping product
outcome.
It is, further, not immediately evident why 3 is the observed
alternative product. This is formed via rearrangement of A to a
halimadienyl+ intermediate, with no C4 → C5 methyl
migration to the clerodane backbone observed. Production of
3 contrasts with the eﬀect of aromatic substitution for the
catalytic histidine in AtCPS, where such further rearrangement
is observed, with removal of the same proton originally added
to initiate the reaction, presumably by returning to the same
aspartate that acted as the catalytic general acid.19 However,
quantum chemical calculations indicated that, at least with the
relevant ent-labda-13E-en-8-yl+ intermediate, this last 1,2-
methyl shift is much more energetically diﬃcult than the
preceding 1,2-shifts. Both the transition state structures and
resulting tertiary carbocation intermediates for these 1,2-shifts
are within ∼7 kcal mol−1 of the initial ent-labda-13E-en-8-yl+
intermediate, while the ﬁnal C4 → C5 methyl shift has an
energetic barrier of ∼14 kcal mol−1 and the resulting ent-
cleroda-13E-en-4-yl+ intermediate is signiﬁcantly higher in
energy than the other intermediates.19 Moreover, the
introduced aromatic group is relatively distant and, thus,
seems unlikely to drive this last methyl shift, such that
production of the clerodane skeletal structure by these AtCPS
mutants is then likely driven by the lack of suitable general
bases for deprotonation of any of the other, relatively more
stable preceding intermediates.
Previous semiempirical quantum chemical calculations
suggested that the various tertiary carbocation intermediates
in rearrangement of syn-labda-13E-en-8-yl+ (A) are all of similar
energy (spanning a range of only 5 kcal mol−1). Speciﬁcally, the
9-yl+ B (see Figure 3) formed by initial 1,2-hydride migration is
predicted to be <1 kcal mol−1 lower in energy than A, and the
syn-halima-13E-en-10-yl+ C formed by subsequent 1,2-methyl
migration is predicted to be 4 kcal mol−1 lower in energy than
A and essentially isoenergetic with the syn-halimad-13E-en-5-yl+
D formed by subsequent 1,2-hydride migration, while the syn-
cleroda-13E-en-4-yl+ E formed by the ﬁnal 1,2-methyl
migration is predicted to be only 1 kcal mol−1 higher in
energy than A.22 Here quantum chemical calculations, using
density functional theory (DFT) methods previously applied to
characterization of terpene carbocation rearrangements (see
Supporting Information for details)23,24 and with proven
utility,25 were used to investigate not only these intermediates
but also the corresponding transition state structures for their
interconversion (Figure 3, numbers in normal text and
brackets; see also Figure S6). This analysis was broadly
supportive of the previously reported results, although the
relative stability of A appears to have been overestimated by the
utilized semiempirical method (Figure 3). In addition, the
barrier for the ﬁnal 1,2-methyl shift is predicted to be smaller
than that found previously for rearrangement of ent-labda-13E-
en-8-yl+,19 both the barrier from D (lower by ∼4 kcal mol−1)
and the overall barrier from A (lower by ∼12 kcal mol−1).26
Accordingly, there is not a large energetic barrier to this ﬁnal
1,2-methyl shift, indicating that there is a suitably positioned
general base in the OsCPS4 active site for deprotonation of D
(note that this would not interfere with initial bicyclization, as
this does not proceed via a corresponding 5-yl+ intermediate),
which alleviates any need to undergo full rearrangement to E to
allow for removal of the initiating proton, unlike what is
observed upon aromatic replacement of the catalytic histidine
in AtCPS.19 Identiﬁcation of this otherwise “silent” general
base, as well as elucidation of the exact role of H501, will be the
subject of future investigation and may require determination of
a high-resolution structure for OsCPS4.
Regardless of the exact mechanism underlying this observed
change in product outcome, it is notable that these
OsCPS4:H501 mutants appear to represent the ﬁrst identiﬁed
syn-HPP synthase, which then oﬀers access to derived natural
products. For example, 3 is likely to be the precursor to various
labdane-related diterpenoids isolated from Vitex agnus and Vitex
rotundifolia, which are Chinese medicinal plants that have been
widely used in Korea, China, and Japan for the treatment of
inﬂammation, headache, migraine, chronic bronchitis, eye pain,
and gastrointestinal infections.27,28 Finally, these studies further
illustrate the plasticity of DTCs, which underlies the expansive
evolution of the labdane-related diterpenoid superfamily of
natural products.
