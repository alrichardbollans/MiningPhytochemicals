Extraction and isolation 
Air-dried powdered leaves of A. cymbifera (100 g) were extracted with MeOH (3 × 250 mL) 
at room temperature. After evaporation in vacuo, the MeOH residue (2.34 g) was submitted to 
column chromatography over 30 g silica gel 60 (0.063−0.200 mm; Merck) (20 × 5 cm) by 
vacuum liquid chromatography, eluted with hexane and mixtures of hexane−EtOAc of 
increasing polarity. This procedure resulted in 12 fractions of 100 mL each (AC-1: hexane;

AC-2: hexane−EtOAc 95:5; AC-3: hexane−EtOAc 9:1; AC-4: hexane−EtOAc 85:15; AC-5: 
hexane−EtOAc 8:2; AC-6: hexane−EtOAc 75:25; AC-7: hexane−EtOAc 7:3; AC-8: 
hexane−EtOAc 65:35; AC-9: hexane−EtOAc 6:4; AC-10: hexane−EtOAc 55:45; AC-11: 
hexane−EtOAc 5:5; AC-12: hexane−EtOAc 4:6). Fractions AC-5 (175 mg), AC-7 (67 mg), 
AC-8 (51 mg), AC-9 (118 mg), and AC-10 (29 mg) exhibited significant activity against 
trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, and the 1H-NMR data of these fractions revealed the 
presence of diterpene (AC-5) and a mixture of lignans (AC-7−AC-10). Thus, these active 
fractions were further purified by thin-layer chromatography to afford the six active 
compounds. TLC analyses were performed with precoated TLC sheets of silica gel eluting 
with different mixtures of MeOH in CH2Cl2 and EtOAc in hexane. Plates were observed 
under a UV lamp (254 nm and 365 nm). The purities of tested compounds were inferred by 
analysis of 1H-NMR spectra.
