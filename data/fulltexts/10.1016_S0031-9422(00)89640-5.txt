Abstract-An enzyme system catalysing the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge at ring A of (S)-canadine [=(S)- tetrahydroberberine] from (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine has been detected in microsomal preparations from different Ranunculaceae and Berberidaceae cell cultures. The cytochrome P-450 enzyme complex has been partly characterized from a protoberberine alkaloid producing Thalictrum tuberosum L. cell line. The enzyme complex consisting of a microsomal associated oxidase with a cytochrome P-450 reductase has a pH optimum at pH 8.5 and a temperature optimum of 40’. The apparent K, values are 33 PM for NADPH and 11.5 PM for tetrahydrocolumbamine. IYTRODUCTlOh’ A considerable number of natural products contain methylenedioxy groups in their structure. In uico ex- periments employing [‘4C]-labelled precursors demon- strated that the methylenedioxy groups, found especially in benzylisoquinolinc alkaloids, are derived by cycliza- tion of an ortho-methoxyphenol to furnish the methyl- enedioxy ring [l-3]. The first report of an enzyme reaction catalysing the methylenedioxy formation ap- peared [4] when two highly stereo- and regiospecific microsomal cytochrome P-450-, NADPH-, and O,- dependent enzymes were discovered and partly charac- terized. These enzymes were responsible for the sequen- tial introduction of two methylenedioxy groups from the substrate, (S)-scoulerine, via (S)-cheilanthifoline to (S)- stylopine. This system was further characterized [S] and more recently shown to consist of two separable cyto- chrome P-450 enzymes catalysing each of the methyl- enedioxy group formations first in the D-ring, leading from (S)-scoulerine to (S)-cheilanthifoline and sub- sequently in the A-ring of this molecule, leading from (S)- cheilanthifoline to (S)-stylopine [L. Kammerer and M. H. Zenk, unpublished results]. Due to the fact that cyto- chrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases are involved in the methylenedioxy bridge formation, we assume that this group is initiated via hydroxylation of the attached methoxy group. This step would generate a hemiformal, possibly representing the crucial intermediate in the reaction mechanism [3]. In a previous attempt to develop an assay system for the analysis of the methylenedioxy bridge formation in *Author lo whom correspondence should be addressed. the conversion of columbamine to berberine in Berberis cell cultures, the expected release of one third of the tritium atoms residing in the [3-0-C3H,]-group of col- umbamine was used by Rueffer and Zenk [6] as a criterion to measure the activity of the suspected ‘ber- berine synthase’. Activity ofan Fe2 ‘-containing cytosolic enzyme was detected, showing at pH 8.9 the typical protoporphyrine absorption at 408 nm and an unusual high temperature optimum at 70”. The enzyme was isolated and purified to homogeneity but the suspected ‘berberine synthase’ turned out, however, to be a peroxidase. This enzyme was studied using [3-O- “CH,]columbamine as substrate [7]. The peroxidase did not form a methylenedioxy bridge, thus not yielding berberine, but rather catalysed the demethylation of the [3-0-CHJ-group of columbamine [7]. The yield of radioactivity released into the medium was exactly 30%, which was previously interpreted [6] as the loss of one third of the [3H]-atoms in the methyl group of columba- mine during the transition to the methylenedioxy group. The claimed [6] ‘berberine synthase’ is, therefore, in- correct as shown by Bauer et al. [7]; the originally observed enzyme activity was an artifact. Both Berberis and Coptis cell cultures [S, 93 have been used in the past to clarify the biosynthesis of berberine at the enzymic level [lo, 111. The last step in berberine biosynthesis, which still remains to be clarified, is the formation of the methylenedioxy group in the transition of (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine to (S)-canadine. Since both cell cultures from the families Berberidaceae and Ranunculaceae produce profuse amounts of ber- berine, cell cultures of both families were used for the detection of an enzyme or enzyme system possibly cata- lysing this remaining biosynthetic step. The metabolic 1219 I220 M. RUEFFFR and M. H. ZENK route leading from (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine to ber- berine has not yet been investigated at the enzymic level and is the subject of this study. It is shown that, similarly to the stylopine forming system of Eschscholtzia [S]. the methylenedioxy bridge formation of berberine is cata- lysed by a specific cytochrome P-450-depcndcnt enzyme. RESIJLTS AND Dl!SCUSSlON The substrate used for the detection of the enzyme catalysing the formation of the methylenedioxy group of canadine from tetrahydrocolumbamine was synthesized enzymically by incubating 2,3-dihydroxy-9,lO-dimeth- oxyprotoberberine with [‘JCH,]S-adenosyl-L-methion- ine and commercially available catechol-O-methyltrans- ferase. In the presence of 0,. [3-O-‘4CH,] columbamine was formed (80% yield) and subsequently reduced with NaBH,. A new assay system was developed in which the [ r4C]-labelled, TLC-purified substrate was incubated together with various protein fractions isolated from a range of cell cultures. The expected labelled products (canadine or berberine) were separated from the substrate by TLC and were subsequently quantitated by TLC- radioscanning. Incubation of (R,S)-[3-O-‘4CH,]tetrahydrocolumb- amine with crude protein extracts from different Ranun- culaceae and Berberis cell cultures did not lead to the formation of compounds with methylenedioxy bridges. However, when microsomal preparations were isolated from different species of Berberidaceae and Ranuncula- ceae and incubated with either [3-0-r4CH,]tetrahy- drocolumbamine or [3-0-‘4CH,]columbamine, a clear but differential formation of berberine could be detected (Table 1) from tetrahydrocolumbamine. Columbamine did not serve as substrate for this reaction. The question remained why berberine was formed instead of the ex- pected canadine. This was due to the activity of (S)- tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (STOX) which cata- Table 1. Occurrence of canadine synthase in plant cell cultures Tissue culture Berheris arisfura DC.

This contaminating enzyme (STOX) was present in considerable quantities in the microsomal fraction oxidizing both the substrate tetrahydrocolumbamine and the product canadine to their corresponding protoberberines, i.e. columbamine and berberinc. This enzyme could not be selectively inhibited nor could the vesicles in which the STOX enzyme is contained [I31 be separated from the micro- somal preparations by differential centrifugation. Com- parison of the enzyme activities showed that the highest transformation of [“CH,]tetrahydrocolumbamine to berberine was found in a protoberberine-containing, yel- low-coloured cell line of Thalicrrum tuherosum (Table 1). which was used for further experiments. The reaction product of the transformation had been identified only by TLC-radioscanning and, therefore, the identity of the product had to be rigorously established. For the identi- fication of the reaction product, twenty standard incuba- tion assays were combined, the radioactively labelled product (13.3 x 10’ dpm prnol. ‘) was reduced with NaBH, to (R,S)-canadine (11.7 x IO” dpm pmol -I), and diluted with unlabelled (R.S)-canadine resulting in a specific activity of 2.2 x IO4 dpm pmol ‘. This compound was recrystallized three times from MeOH. The specific activity remained constant at 2.0 x IO4 dpm prnol_ ‘. This experiment clearly identified the reaction product of the [‘4C]tetrahydrocolumbamine incubation as berberine which had been formed via canadine by oxidation with STOX that contaminated the microsomal fraction. The reactton was dependent on NADPH. Replacement of NADPH with NADH showed a reaction rate of only ca 21%. A synergistic effect achieved by adding both NADPH and NADH, which had been observed pre- viously in cytochrome P-450-catalysed reactions [ 141, was not observed here. Replacement of NADPH with NAD, NADP, FAD or FMN showed no reaction. The enzyme was inactive in the absence of O,, as shown by the removal of 0, by a glucose oxidase/catalase system [ 151. The formation of the methylenedioxy bridge in the pre- sence of O2 and NADPH could be strongly inhibited by carbon monoxide. The inhibition could be partially re- versed by illumination with white light (Table 2). Further analysis showed that predominantly blue light (wave- length 43g nm) was responsible for this reversal (data not Table 2.

A second indication for the involvement of a cytochrome P-450 enzyme in the formation of the methyl- enedioxy bridges of canadine and berberine was the inhibition of the reaction by typical cytochrome P-450 inhibitors (Table 3). Inhibitors such as ketoconazole, tetcyclacis and the naphthoquinones, plumbagin, mena- dione and juglone, which interact with heme group [ 163, strongly inhibited the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge under the conditions given in Table 3. Strong inhibition was also observed by addition of cytochrome c which extracts electrons formed by the NADPHcyto- chrome c-reductase from the enzyme complex (Table 3). The content of cytochrome P-450 in the microsomal preparations was determined by the method of Omura and Sato [ 173 to be 163 pmol mg - ‘, which falls within the normal range determined for higher plants [18]. The enzyme system transforming tetrahydrocolumbamine to canadine has been named canadine synthase. Canadine is the preferred name over tetrahydroprotoberberine (which includes canadine) because tetrahydroberberine tends to be confused with the tetrahydroprotoberberines and a specific oxidase like STOX (tetrahydroprotoberbe- rine oxidase [12]) is readily confused with tetrahydrober- berine oxidase [193. The physical characteristics of canadine synthase were as follows. The optimal reaction rate was observed at pH 8.5 in glycine-NaOH buffer (Fig. I) at 40’. The apparent Rnl values for NADPH and (R,S)-tetrahydro- columbamine were determined to be 33 and 11 PM, respectively (Fig. 2). The enzyme was highly substrate specific and would not accept tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids (differing from tetrahydrocolumbamine in ring 8 9 10 11 PH Fig. 1. pH-Dependence of the canadine synthase.

In both families, the end product alkaloid is berberine. This investigation completes our knowledge of the biosynthesis of berberine starting from two molecules of the primary metabolite, I.-tyrosine.

In addition, the protoberberine alkaloid, columbamine, was not transformed. This again demonstrates that the path- way from tetrahydrocolumbamine to berberinc proceeds through canadine, not through columbamine as pre- viously suggested [6, 1 O] for Brrheris. Of a wide variety of C-ring reduced protoberberine substrates, only tetrahy- drocolumbamine was transformed. Moreover, like other enzymes in the protoberberine pathway [IO], the cana- dine synthase showed strong stcreospecificity, accepting only (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine as substrate but not its (R)-congener (Table 4). Planr murerial. All cell culture were provided by the cell culture laboratory of this department. The cells were grown in I I flasks containing 250 ml Linsmaier and Skoog medium [20] over a period of 7 days at 23’ on a gyratory shaker (100 rpm) a~ 750 lux. For partial charac- terization of the enzyme. a protobcrberinc producing cell line of Thulictrum ruherosum was used.

The cells were deep frozen with liquid nitrogen and used immediately. Canadine synthase is a unique microsomal bound cytochrome P-450 enzyme which occurs in berberine- producing cell cultures within the Berberidaceae and Ranunculaceae. The enzyme accepts exclusively (S)- tctrahydrocolumbamine as substrate and converts it lo (S)-canadine. Although the canadine formed in the micro- somal preparations was immediately oxidized to berberine by an (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase contamination in this subcellular fraction, the stereo- chemical configuration of the canadine was without doubt the S-epimer due to the stereospecificity of STOX [l2]. Had the canadine that was formed been the R- epimer, it would have accumulated during the assay. Rudiochemids. (R.S)-[3-0-‘4CH,]Tetrahydrocolumb- amine was synthesized from 2,3-dihydroxy-9,lO-dimeth- oxyprotoberberine by incubation with [14CH,]- S-adcnosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and catechol-O-mcthyl- transferase (Sigma). The columbamine formed was re- duced with NaBH, and the product purified by TLC (Polygram Sil G.‘UV2,,, Machercy and Nagel, tolu- ene-EtOAc-diethylamine. 7 : 2 : I R, 0.5). The isolated (R,S)-[3-0-‘4CH,]tetrahydrocolumbamine had a speci- fic activity of 56 &i [lmol I. Due to the lack of regio- specificity of the porcine catcchol-O-methyltransferase, (R,S)-[2-0-‘4CH,]lelrahydrojatrorrhizine (R, 0.4) was formed to approximately 10% as a by product of the enzymic synthesis. (R,S)-[3-0-‘4CH,]Cheilanthifoline, (R,S)-[2-O-LJCH,]~etrahydrogroenlandicinc and (S)-[ IO- 0-“CHJnandinine were synthesized according to ref. [4].

Berbcrine synthesis 1223 NADPH, 50 pmol glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.5, and 0.1-0.8 mg protein were incubated in a total volume of 300 ~1 for 30 min at 40”. Assays with boiled enzyme served as control. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 200~1 EtOAc, shaken mechanically for IO min and the phases sepd by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 3 min at room temperature. The EtOAc layer was subjected to TLC (Polygram Sil G/UV,,,, Macherey and Nagel) using cyclohexane~iethylamine (9: 1) as solvent system (columbamine R, 0.0, tetrahydrocolumbamine R, 0.1, berberine R, 0.5, canadine R, 0.8). The chromato- grams were scanned and quantitated for radioactivity by a TLC linear analyser (Berthold). Since in these tissue cultures the (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (STOX) [12] is very active and could not be separated from the microsomal frs either by sucrose density centri- fugation or by gel filtration on Sephacryl-S-1000 (Phar- macia), the product of the reaction was not canadine, but rather berberine. Prepration of microsomal fractions. Deep-frozen cells, typcially 1oOg fr. wt. were thawed with the double amount (w/v) 0.1 M Tricine-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, con- taining 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM thioglycolic acid in an ice-cold mortar and stirred with a pestle for about 20 min. After filtration through cheesecloth the crude extract was centrifuged at loo00 g for 10 min at 4”. The supematant was passed through an XAD-2 column (2.5 x 15 cm, Serva) that had been equilibrated with the above buffer. The microsomes and vesicles of the alkaloid-free column run-through were harvested by centrifugation at SOOOO g for 30 min at 4”. Addition of MgCI,, as described earlier [22], did not result in higher enzyme activities. Product identification. For product identification, 20 standard assays were incubated for 30 mm, combined and passed over an XAD-2 column (Serva). The alkaloids were eluted with MeOH, concentrated under a stream of N, and resolved by TLC (Polygram, Macherey and Nagel, solvent system: cyclohexanediethylamine, 9: 1). After determination of the specific activity of berberine (13.3 x lo6 dpm pmol-I), this enzymic product was re- duced with NaBH, to (R,S)-canadine and chromato- graphed again in the same solvent system. The specific activity was determined for a second time (11.7 x lo6 dpm pmol- l). In addition, the product was diluted with unlabelled canadine (180 mg = 532 pmol) and recrystal- lized x 3 times from MeOH. The specific activity was determined after each crystallization step.
