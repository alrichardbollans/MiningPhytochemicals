Wepresent here new holistic strategies that combine differentstatistical spectroscopic and analytical techniques to improveand simplify the process of metabolite identification. Weexemplify these strategies using study data collected as partof a dietary intervention to improve health and which elicits arelatively subtle suite of changes from complex molecularprofiles. We identify three new dietary biomarkers related tothe consumption of peas (N-methyl nicotinic acid), apples(rhamnitol), and onions (N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide) that can be used to enhance dietary assessment and assess adherence to diet. As part of the strategy, we introduce anew probabilistic statistical spectroscopy tool, RED-STORM (Resolution EnhanceD SubseT Optimization by ReferenceMatching), that uses 2D J-resolved 1H NMR spectra for enhanced information recovery using the Bayesian paradigm to extract asubset of spectra with similar spectral signatures to a reference. RED-STORM provided new information for subsequentexperiments (e.g., 2D-NMR spectroscopy, solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography prefaced mass spectrometry) used toultimately identify an unknown compound. In summary, we illustrate the benefit of acquiring J-resolved experiments alongsideconventional 1D 1H NMR as part of routine metabolic profiling in large data sets and show that application of complementarystatistical and analytical techniques for the identification of unknown metabolites can be used to save valuable time and resources.Dietary interventions (DIs) are a cornerstone in themanagement of reducing the risk of noncommunicablediseases1−3 and promoting healthy aging.4 However, under-standing the response to dietary change is compromised by poorcompliance to dietary recommendations and the inherentlyinaccurate self-reporting dietary recording tools available, withprevalence of misreporting estimated at 30−88%,5,6 lowering thevalue of such studies and dataIt has been demonstrated that dietary biomarkers can reflectconsumption of specific foods and enhance dietary intake assess-ment at individual and population levels.7−17 Dietary biomarkersare based on the concept that food intake is highly correlatedwith excretion levels of food-related compounds over a givenperiod of time. These “biomarkers” can be compounds that areexcreted unchanged10,17 or that have undergone metabolic con-version, for example, by gut bacteria.8,11,13,14 Metabolic profilingof biofluids using spectroscopic technologies18 can detectReceived: August 24, 2016Accepted: February 27, 2017Published: February 27, 2017Articlepubs.acs.org/ac© 2017 American Chemical Society 3300 DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03324Anal.

Some ofthe compounds in these spectral profiles are potential biomarkersof dietary intake. However, finding associations between self-reported dietary intakes and excreted metabolites19,20 in order todiscover potential food biomarkers is plagued by inaccuraciesof self-reporting. Thus, confirmation of a candidate biomarker isbest achieved by using a controlled food challenge with sub-sequent validation in a larger population or study cohort.17The complementarity of the main workhorses of metabolicprofiling, one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance(1H NMR) spectroscopy and hyphenated chromatograpic-massspectrometry (MS) techniques, has been extensively demon-strated in the past decade.21−23 However, chemical character-ization of molecular species associated with an outcome stillis a limiting factor for exploratory metabolic profiling. NMRspectroscopy provides an atom-centered spectroscopic toolfor structure elucidation that can be enhanced by statisticalspectroscopic methods24,25 or by physical hyphenation withchromatographic methods such as solid-phase extraction(SPE),26 liquid chromatography (LC)21 or LC-NMR-MS21,27to achieve a better chemical characterization of endogenous andexogenous metabolites.Metabolite identification in 1H NMR spectroscopy is aided bythe intrinsic correlation of peaks from the same metabolite.Statistical TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (STOCSY)28 makesuse of this property by calculating the correlation between onespectral variable (driver) and all other variables to uncoverstructural associations. In cases where there are sufficient spectra,identification of 1H NMR peaks using statistical methods isan efficient strategy that utilizes existing spectral data withoutrequiring additional spectroscopic experiments a priori, whichhas obvious advantages in usage of volume-limited samples and iscost-efficient.23 Since the STOCSYmethod was published, manyderivations have aimed to improve specific properties such asdifferentiation between structural and pathway correlations byclustering, subset selection, or stoichiometric relationships.24Statistical correlation can be undermined by overlapped signalsunrelated to the metabolite of interest in a 1D-NMR spectrum,and 2D-NMR experiments are still required for unambiguousstructure elucidation.29 In addition, the structural informationobtained using statistical algorithms is dependent on criteria suchas correlation thresholds28,30 or correlation-distance cut-offs.31SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching (STORM)32 is aderivation of STOCSY that aims to separate out confoundingspectra that do not match a supplied reference spectrum of apotential biomarker signal, thereby showing clearer spectralcorrelations between variables for both low and high intensitysignals. The reference spectrum is a single spectrum that containsthe signal of interest. The peak segment is correlated with thesame region of all samples, and a high correlation indicates thesamples contain the same signal and are likely “informative”,whereas samples with a low correlation do not have this signal andare uninformative. Subsets of spectra and variable correlationsare found by carefully correcting for multiple testing in bothphases and using statistical shrinkage. Here, we describe a holisticstrategy for the identification of unknown metabolites thatcombines the strengths of statistical spectroscopy, NMR, multipleseparation techniques, and MS, and apply the strategy to identifythree novel dietary biomarkers. In addition, we demonstrate anextension of STORM to 2D-NMR spectra to uncover the identityof unknown metabolites.■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONFood Challenges (FCs). For the discovery of urinarybiomarkers of peas, apples, and onions, three FCs weredesigned. A total of nine healthy participants (4 women, 5 men;nonsmokers; age 22−32 years; BMI 21.2−25.3 kg/m2) wererecruited and assigned to one of the three FCs. Participants wereprovided with the assigned foods as part of a standardized dinner(including 125 g of chicken breast as a protein source).Incremental amounts of the designated food were consumedover three consecutive days: 60/120/180 g for (boiled) peas,40/80/160 g for (raw) apples, and 20/40/60 g for (fried) onions.For 24 h preceding the FC, and throughout the FC, participantswere asked to consume their habitual diet and avoid consump-tion of coffee/tea/cocoa and any additional amounts of assignedfoods. Cumulative urine samples were collected into sterilizedsingle-use urine containers (International Scientific Supplies Ltd.,Bradford, U.K.) from dinner up to and including the first morningvoid. Urine samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis.Controlled Clinical Trial (CCT). There were 19 healthyparticipants (9 women, 10 men; nonsmokers; age 25−60 years;BMI 21.1−33.3 kg/m2) who attended the NIHR/WellcomeTrust Imperial Clinical Research Facility for four 3-day inpatientperiods, separated by a period of >4 days, with food and drinkintake tightly controlled (alcohol/coffee/tea/cocoa were notprovided). In random order, participants followed all four DIsrepresenting 100% (diet 1), 75% (diet 2), 50% (diet 3), and 25%(diet 4) of WHO healthy eating guidelines1 with respect tocarbohydrates, fats, fiber, fruits, salt, sugar, and vegetables. Fulldetails of the clinical trial design have been describedpreviously.33 Foods consumed relevant to the present study aretabulated in Supporting Information.Each participant collected cumulative urine samples (CS) oneach day of each DI from after breakfast to before lunch (CS1),after lunch to before dinner (CS2), and after dinner to beforebreakfast the following day (CS3). The 24 h urine samples wereobtained by pooling the cumulative samples. Aliquots of urinewere transferred into Eppendorf tubes and stored at−80 °C untilanalysis. All participants provided informed, written consentprior to the CCT (Registration No. ISRCTN-43087333), whichwas approved by the London Brent Research Ethics Committee(13/LO/0078). All studies were carried out in accordance withthe Declaration of Helsinki.1H NMR Analysis. Aliquots of 600 μL of urine samples werecentrifuged at 16 000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. All available samples(nFC = 27, nCCT = 906, for missing CCT data see SupportingInformation) were prepared for 1HNMR spectroscopy followingthe protocol described in ref 34 mixing 540 μL of supernatantwith 60 μL of pH 7.4 phosphate buffer containing trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3,-2H4]-propionate as an internal reference standard(“NMR buffer”). Water-suppressed 1H NMR spectroscopywas performed at 300 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer(Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany) using a standard 1D pulsesequence (RD−gz,1−90°−t−90°−tm−gz,2−90°−ACQ) with sat-uration of the water resonance.7 The following abbreviationsapply: RD is the relaxation delay, t is a short delay (4 μs),90° represents a radio frequency (RF) pulse that tips themagnetization by 90°, tm is the mixing time (10 ms), gz,1 and gz,2are magnetic field z-gradients both applied for 1 ms, and ACQis the data acquisition period of 2.73 s. 1H NMR spectra wereacquired using 4 dummy scans and 32 scans, and 64K timedomain points, with a spectral window of 20 ppm. Prior toFourier transformation, free induction decays were multiplied byAnalytical Chemistry ArticleDOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03324Anal. Chem. 2017, 89, 3300−33093301an exponential function corresponding to a line broadening of0.3 Hz. 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total urinevolume to correct for differences in dilution.1H−1H 2D J-resolved experiments7 were acquired using a pulsesequence to detect the J-couplings in the second dimension, withsuppression of the water resonance (RD−90°−t1− 180°−t1−ACQ), where t1 is an incremented time period, RD is 2 s,180° represents a 180° RF pulse, and ACQ is 0.41 s. J-resolvedspectra were acquired using 16 dummy scans and 2 scans, 8Kpoints with spectral window of 16.7 ppm for f2 and 40 incrementswith spectral windowof 78Hz for f1. Continuous wave irradiationwas applied at the water resonance frequency using a 25 Hz RFduring the RD. A sine-bell apodization function was applied to f2and a squared sine-bell to f1 of the J-resolved data, followed byFourier transformation, tilting by 45°, and symmetrization alongf1 before data analysis.A suite of 2D-NMR experiments including 1H−1H TOtalCorrelation SpectroscopY (TOCSY), 1H−1H COrrelationSpectroscopY (COSY), 1H−13C Heteronuclear Single QuantumCoherence (HSQC), and 1H−13CHeteronuclear Multiple-BondCorrelation (HMBC) spectroscopy were used for identificationpurposes.25,29SPE-NMR. Apple extracts were homogenized using aKenwood KMix Blender for 5 min. The puree obtained wasfiltered using a stainless steel filter and centrifuged for 10 minat 16 000 × g. A 2 mL portion of each sample (urine/apple) waslyophilized overnight. Freeze-dried (FD) urine/apple sampleswere dissolved in 1 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.5and briefly sonicated prior to being loaded onto a 100 mg/mLBond Elut phenylboronic acid (PBA) SPE-cartridge (AgilentTechnologies, Stockport, U.K.). The SPE-cartridge was con-ditioned with 1 mL of 70:30 v/v H2O/ACN, and 0.1 M HCl,followed by 1 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 10. Afterconditioning, the sample was loaded onto the SPE-cartridge.The loaded sample was washed with 2 mL of 50:50 v/v ACN/sodium phosphate (10 mM) pH 8.5. The sample was elutedusing 1 mL of acidified solutions (0.1 M HCl) of 100% H2O,90:10 v/v H2O/ACN, and 70:30 v/v H2O/ACN and sub-sequently lyophilized until dry. The dried eluent fractions werereconstituted in 540 μL of H2O and 60 μL of NMR buffer,vortexed, and centrifuged prior to NMR analysis.LC-NMR-MS.27 A 5 mL portion of urine collected over-night after consumption of onion was lyophilized overnight,reconstituted in 500 μL of the original urine sample, andvortexed, sonicated and centrifuged (20 min at 16 000 × g). Thesupernatant was repeatedly injected (7 × 2 μL) onto a reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters Atlantis-T3, 3 μm, 4.6 mm ×150 mm at 30 °C) in a Waters Acquity UPLC comprising abinary solvent manager and photodiode array detector with aWaters CTC autosampler with 100 μL sampling needle, andeluted at 0.8 mL/min using the following gradient: 0.0−60.0 min(99.9:0.1% H2O/formic acid), 60.01−65.0 min (99.9:0.1%methanol/formic acid), 65.01−127.5 min (99.9:0.1% H2O/formic acid). The chromatographic separation of the sample wasfractionated using a Waters Fraction Collector III. A total of120 fractions were collected, one every 29 s (starting at t = 5 min,finishing at t = 63 min), and dried under a stream of nitrogen.Each fraction was redissolved in 540 μL of H2O and 60 μL ofNMR buffer and analyzed by 1H NMR. A volume of 50 μL ofthe fraction containing the unknown metabolite was analyzedby reversed-phase LC-MS, Waters Acquity Ultra PerformanceLC system coupled to Xevo G2 Q-TOF mass spectrometer(Waters, Milford, MA), following an established metabolicprofiling method.35 The optimized capillary voltage, cone voltage,and collision energy were 3 kV/20 V/4 V for ESI+ and 1.5 kV/30 V/6 V for ESI−, using a source temperature of 120 °C anddesolvation temperature of 600 °C. Desolvation was 1000L/h forboth, and cone gas flows were 50 L/h (ESI+) and 150 L/h(ESI−). Leucine enkephalin was used as the reference lock massat 556.2771 ([M + H]+) and 554.2615 ([M − H]−).RED-STORM Algorithm. Here, STORM was extended in aprobabilistic framework and modified for applicability to 2Ddata to provide a clearer signature of structural correlations in thedata, and the extended algorithm was named ResolutionEnhanceD SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching (RED-STORM).High correlations in the data are of interest between samplesand a reference spectrum of a signal of interest (for subsetoptimization) and between a driver and all other variables(for assessing variable importance). However, high correlationsare not normally distributed because of the upper bound on thecorrelation ([−1, 1]); this results in their distributions beingnegatively skewed. Therefore, the correlation (ρ) is transformedto a Fisher z-score, which results in approximately normallydistributed data that can be analyzed using parametricmethods:ρρ= +−⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟z12ln11 (1)Next, the distribution of all z-scores is modeled using a Gaussianmixture model (GMM). AGMM is a weighted sum of kGaussianclusters and is defined as∑μ σ π πφ μ σ| =−=p z( , , ) ( , )jkj j j210,12(2)Here, z has n data points. μ are the kmeans and σ2 the k variances.π is the mixture weights for each of k Gaussians (∑ j = 1k πj = 1),and φ0,1 is a normalized Gaussian distribution with specified μand σ. In order to obtain clusters of variables from the Fisherz-transformed correlations, a parameter-free GMM is used.36The model automatically learns the optimal number of clustersfrom the data. For completeness, a description of the method inbrief follows; for mathematical proofs, see ref 36.Each cluster mean (μj) and precision (σj−2) from eq 2 are givenGaussian (p(μj|λ, r) ∼ φ0,1(λ, r−1)) and Gamma (p(σj−2|γ, β) ∼Γ(γ, β−1)) priors, respectively. Here, λ and r are hyperparametersfor the means of all clusters. Similarly, γ (shape) and β (scale) arehyperparameters for the cluster precisions. The hyperparametersthemselves are initialized from the observation mean (μz)and variance (σz2) as vague priors (p(λ) ∼ φ0,1(μz, σz2); p(r) ∼Γ(1, σz2); p(γ−1) ∼ Γ(1, 1); p(β) ∼ Γ(1, σz−2)).

At any stage when anymj = 0, clusterj is removed.This process is repeated for a set number of (burn-in)iterations (typically >100) to achieve some stability in finding asuitable k, depending on the data, before continuing with theremainder of (post burn-in) iterations of the Markov-chain.The final predictive distribution is a weighted average over the postburn-in iteration clusters. The order (for i of z) is randomized ineach iteration to avoid bias.For subset selection, the variables that make up the referencesegment of interest are correlated with the same variables from allspectra (STORM); the correlations are z-transformed, andthe distribution is fitted using the procedure described above.The final predictive distribution is converted to a cumulativedistribution function (cdf), and for each sample the probabilityof it resembling the reference is calculated. The subset containsall spectra that satisfy p(zi|cdf) ≥ ts, where ts is a user-definedthreshold for the samples. The reference spectrum is updatedby using a weighted average of the spectra in the subset. Usingonly the spectra in the subset, the correlations of all drivervariables (reference segment of interest) with all other spectralvariables are calculated. To alleviate the computational load ofthe algorithm, for 2D J-resolved NMR, and other 2D-spectra, thealgorithm is run on the variables that make up the peaks of thereference spectrum rather than all variables. The median ρ acrossall driver variables is calculated for each variable andz-transformed, and the same procedure as for subset selectionis performed for the variables. MATLAB code can be obtained bycontacting the authors.■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of a Urinary Biomarker for Pea (Pisumsativum) Consumption.On comparison of the urinary spectraobtained pre- and postpea intake, the urinary concentration ofN-methylnicotinic acid (NMNA, trigonelline), although presentin the baseline samples, showed a dose dependent incrementafter increasing the consumption of peas (Figure 1A−C) duringthe FC, suggesting it as a candidate biomarker. However, thepresence of NMNA in the baseline samples indicated that peaswere not the sole source of NMNA. The CCT data showed asimilar pattern (Figure 1D−F) with low levels for diet 1 (no peasprovided) and incrementally higher levels for diets 2−4 (peasprovided). Interestingly, NMNA appears in highest concen-trations in CS3 and 24 h samples from diet 2, whereas peaswere provided only during dinner in increasing amounts (0/20/40/60 g for diets 1−4). However, chocolate was provided as anafternoon snack in diets 1−3, and baked beans were provided aspart of dinner in diet 2 (see Supporting Information Table S1)which may be alternative sources of NMNA.It has been long known that several plant materials (includingcoffee, tea, and cocoa) are rich in niacin (vitamin B3) and some ofits major metabolic products,38 including NMNA. In addition,NMNA has been proposed as urinary biomarker of coffee con-sumption.11 Thus, although it is a poor biomarker of pea intake inthe sense of specificity, NMNA could still be used to detect peaintake in urine after controlling for other sources.With nonspecific dietary biomarkers, biomarker patterns, ratherthan a single biomarker, can be used to differentiate betweendifferent food sources.17 For instance, 2-furoylglycine, anothermarker of coffee consumption,16 can be used to cross-check forcoffee consumption and as secondary marker to adjust theFigure 2.

Broader knowledge of dietary bio-markers will contribute to solving this specificity issue.Identification of Urinary Biomarker of Apple (Malusdomestica) Consumption. After consumption of increasedamounts of apple, a spectral signal at δ 1.285 was found to beincreased (Figure 2A). This same signal was found in incrementallyhigher levels in the urine of participants who consumed increasingamounts of apple during the CCT (Figure 2B); diets 2−4contained 50/100/150 g of apple, respectively, as a midmorningsnack. The absence of this signal in urine samples from participantson diet 1 is consistent with there being no apple intake in diet 1.STORM analysis (Figure 2C) revealed high correlations of thedriver (δ 1.285) with a shoulder of the 3-hydroxyisovalerate peakat δ 1.275(s), suggesting the singlet may in fact be a doublet. Thiswas confirmed using J-resolved spectroscopy (Figure 2D). Toconfirm the identity of the molecule giving rise to the doublet,we performed SPE using a PBA-cartridge on both the urine(Figure 2E) and apple puree (Figure 2F) samples to isolate thesignal in one of the fractions for identification purposes, which wassubsequently confirmed by NMR analysis. To assess the specificityof this doublet to apple consumption, we performed PBA-SPE onurine samples post-pear-consumption (using the same protocol asfor apple) and did not find the metabolite peak in the urine or inany fraction (Figure 2G). 2D-NMR experiments were performedon fraction 1 (Supporting Information) suggesting rhamnitol aspotential biomarker; a chemical spike-in experiment (Figure 2H)confirmed the identity. Rhamnitol is a component in differentvarieties of apples,39 and taken together, these results confirmrhamnitol as specific biomarker for apple consumption. Thesuitability of rhamnitol for quantification of apple intake will beinvestigated in a follow-up study.Proof-of-Concept of RED-STORM. The identification ofrhamnitol as urinary biomarker of apple consumption has shownhow overlap in 1D spectra cannot be resolved using STORM asthe signals overlap with those of 3-hydroxyisovalerate, commonlyfound in urine samples, which reduces the power of the statisticalcorrelation method. J-resolved NMR spectra are able to“untangle” overlap using the J-coupling as the second dimension.In large metabolic profiling studies, both standard one-dimen-sional 1H NMR and J-resolved experiments are commonly runtogether, since the J-resolved acquisition only adds 5 min to thetotal acquisition time. While standard 1D 1H NMR spectra arecommonly used for data analysis, the corresponding J-resolvedspectra can be used for identification purposes.Here, we illustrate the benefit of using RED-STORM (seeExperimental Section for algorithm) over STORM using awell-known dietary biomarker as example. N-Acetyl-S-methyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (NAcSMCSO) is the major urinary metab-olite after consumption of cruciferous and other vegetables.14Edmands et al. have shown that the methyl-sulfoxide signalcorrelates mostly with the intake of its substrate, and componentof cruciferous vegetables, SMCSO, and two other metabolicproducts, but intramolecular correlations driven from the δ 2.78peak of NAcSMCSO were weaker than those observed betweenthe methyl-sulfoxide signals of other related molecules. This canalso been seen in our data (Figure 3A,B). Our data comes from adiverse set of samples, of which only some contain metabolicproducts of broccoli consumption. Here STORM was not ableto uncover the structural correlations, possibly due to overlapwith more intense signals and the overall high variability ofsamples compared with the study by Edmands et al. (high/lowconsumers of cruciferous vegetables). The application ofRED-STORM to two-dimensional J-resolved spectra of thesame individuals, however, clearly showed some intramolecularstructural correlations, which were stronger than correla-tions between NAcSMCSO and other SMCSO-metabolites(Figure 3C). The chemical shifts identified (δ 4.38 (m) and δ3.10 (m), with probability >0.99) indeed come from the samemetabolite;14 however, δ 3.30 (m) was not observed as itssignals are heavily overlapped with other multiplets (such asmethylhistidines) in the same region.Figure 3.

Chem. 2017, 89, 3300−33093305Complementarity of Statistical and Analytical Plat-forms for Identification of a Urinary Biomarker of Onion(Allium cepa) Consumption. Previously, dimethylsulfone(δ 3.16 (s)) had been proposed as biomarker of onion con-sumption.9 However, it has two major disadvantages; first, it isonly a singlet, and thus assignment can be ambiguous, but second,andmore importantly, the chemical shift of dimethylsulfone is in aregion of the NMR spectrum where there are many other di- andtrimethyl signals that may confound this metabolite identification.Through an FC we have identified a tentative novel biomarker ofonion consumption, which is a multiplet signal at δ 1.97 (dd)(Figure 4A). The presence of this onion-related signal wasconfirmed using the CCT samples (Figure 4B). STORM analysisusing the peak at δ 1.97 as the driver (Figure 3C) clearly shows3 other correlated signals (δ 2.03 (s), δ 6.50 (m), and δ 6.65 (m)).Due to the clear multiplet structure, we applied RED-STORMon the J-resolved spectra and discovered additional signals(δ 3.44 (m) and δ 4.44 (m)) with a high probability of beingintramolecular (>0.97) (Figure 4E).To illustrate how the process for subset selection works,we show the distribution fitting procedure of RED-STORMon the z-transformed correlations of all J-resolved spectra(n = 906) with the reference spectrum of the metabolite ofinterest (Supporting Information Figure S8). There appear to betwo main clusters of sample−reference correlations that followdifferent Gaussian distributions. After completion, the sampleswith p(zi|cdf) ≥ 0.5 were included in the subset (n = 320).Inspection of the relation between p(zi|cdf) and the percentageof samples from each unique type of urine sample (collectiontime, diet) that pass a certain threshold (Figure 4D) gives a veryclear indication that the metabolite is found mostly in CS3 and24 h samples of diets 3 and 4. Small amounts of onions (20 g and40 g for diets 3 and 4, respectively) were consumed with dinner(matching the presence of the unknown metabolite in CS3) inboth of these diets. While no onion was provided in diets 1 and 2,it is interesting to see that the CS2 sample from diet 2 alsoappeared to contain low levels of this metabolite. On furtherinspection of the dietary composition, onion traces were found tobe present in the sausage casserole that was provided to the CCTvolunteers (in diet 2) for lunch.Using the subset with the highest signal-to-noise of theunknown compound (n = 320), the reference is updated. Thez-transformed correlations of the driver peak (δ 1.97 (dd)) withall spectral peaks were calculated, and the resulting distributionwas fitted (Supporting Information Figure S9); here, most of thez-scores tend to follow a Gaussian distribution around 0, andFigure 4.

(D) Probability of samples resemblingthe reference signal (x-axis) versus the percentage (y-axis) of samples from each type of urine collection in the CCT. It reveals that specific samples ofcertain diets (CS3 and 24 h urine samples of the two healthiest diets and a minor amount in CS2 of diet 3) contain the unknown metabolite.

It is these z-transformedcorrelations that are likely structural or otherwise closely relatedto the multiplet of interest; the resulting cdf then gives the resultas shown in Figure 4E.STORM found 4 peaks associated with the driver; theJ-coupling constants of the three multiplet signals indicatedthese were adjacent. RED-STORM identified an additional2 multiplets which were in regions with overlap in the 1H NMRFigure 5.

Chem. 2017, 89, 3300−33093307spectrum; however, measurement of the J-couplings (δ 4.44 (m):9.78, 8.20, and 4.21Hz; δ 3.44 (m), 13.38, and 4.21Hz) indicatedat least one undiscovered peak. In order to uncover the completestructure, we then employed analytical methods for furtherstructure elucidation. First, we used a urine sample, taken after avolunteer ate 90 g (dry weight) of (fried) onions over dinner,to obtain a concentrated amount of the unknown metabolite andperformed LC coupled to 1H NMR to isolate the compound inan LC-fraction (Figure 5A). The full 1H NMR spectrum ofthe fraction (Figure 5B) was able to uncover two more signals(δ 3.28 (dd); δ 8.30 with a weak doublet-like splitting) matchingwith previously measured J-couplings. Analysis of the fractionusing LC-MS (ESI+) provided a likely chemical formula ofthe unknown metabolite of interest, C8H13NO4S (Figure 5C).Using additional 2D-NMR experiments the signals couldnow be properly assigned (Figure 5D) which resulted inthe identification of the complete structure (Figure 5E) of theonion biomarker: N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide(NAcSPCSO).To the best of our knowledge, this metabolite has not beenreported before. On the basis of its structure, we assume that it isa direct metabolite of S-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (SPCSO).SPCSO is the major flavor precursor in Allium cepa40 andprecursor to the main lachrymatory factor (Z)-propanethial-sulfoxide.41 However, NAcSPCSO does not appear to be theproduct of any of the known (degradation) pathways in thegenus Allium,42 and we hypothesize that it is produced by meansof an N-acetyltransferase acetyl-CoA conjugation mechanism,analogous to the production of NAcSMCSO.14 However,SMCSO is not specific for cruciferous vegetables, and can alsobe found in certain Allium species (including onion). However,SPCSO is specific for A. ascalonicum (shallot), A. cepa, A. nutans(chives), and A. schoenoprasum (chives).40,42The integrated analytical and statistical two-dimensionalspectroscopy strategy for metabolite identification outperformsexisting strategies, such as STOCSY and STORM, by utilizingthe full resolution J-resolved spectra including the J-couplingconstants to allow detection of extra signals attributed to intra-molecular correlations. Further clarity on structural assignmentis provided by the differentiation of intra- and intermolecularconnectivities, not easily differentiated by the basic statisticalspectroscopy methods. Thus, identification of NAcSPCSO wasonly possible through the use of the novel structural elucidationpathway presented here combining statistical and analyticaltechniques.■ CONCLUSIONSSuccessful structure elucidation of unknown metabolites relieson a combination of the most suitable statistical and analyticalstrategies and is dependent on metabolite concentration andexcretion kinetics, overlap of spectral peaks, and chemicalcharacteristics of the compound. The newly introducedstatistical spectroscopy tool, RED-STORM, is able to extractinformation about potential biomarkers that STORM and otherstatistical spectroscopy methods cannot provide from 1D-NMRdata. Moreover, RED-STORM does not rely on arbitrarycorrelation-type thresholds28,30,31 or multiple testing adjustedP-values,32 but learns probabilities from the distribution ofthese data and is therefore less affected by sample size,43 and theeffects of normalization and scaling,44 than frequentist methodscan be. RED-STORM highlights the added benefit of acquiringJ-resolved experiments alongside conventional 1H NMRdata as part of metabolic profiling analytical routines.34Statistical spectroscopy tools can help narrow down the numberof analytical experiments that need to be performed (saving timeand money). However, for biomarker identification purposesthey should not be used by themselves as we have shown thatanalytical experiments on selected samples can provideinformation that cannot be gathered using statistical meansalone. These analytical experiments are ideally limited toperforming a chemical spike-in experiment, but often traditionalanalytical tools (freeze-drying, SPE-NMR,26 LC-fractionation27)are required in order to isolate the unknown metabolite forfurther study and confirmation by 2D-NMR and MS. As a resultof performing three FCs and combining a suite of statistical andanalytical tools, we were able to identify new dietary biomarkersfor pea, apple, and onion. These were subsequently validated inan in-patient randomized CCT33 where all food and drink wasfully controlled. Specific dietary biomarkers, such as rhamnitol(apple) and N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide(onion), can be used to assess adherence to diet and/or toincrease the accuracy of self-reported dietary records that sufferfrom misreporting issues.■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT*S Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACSPublications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03324.Figures (24) of distribution fitting, 2D-NMR spectra, andLC-MS experiments, and two tables containing CCTinformation and pseudocode of the algorithm (PDF)■ AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding Authors*E-mail: elaine.holmes@imperial.ac.uk.*E-mail: j.nicholson@imperial.ac.uk.ORCIDJoram M.
