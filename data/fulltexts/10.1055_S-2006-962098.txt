5-Lipoxygenase assay (8) was performed using intact porcine leukocytes 
(1.5 x 107cells/ml), which were incubated with 15pM lonophor A23187, 2mM 
CaCI,, lOpM ETYA, and 0.1 pCi l-[14C]-arachidonic acid for 5min at 37°C. 
Arachidonic acid and its metabolites were separated and determined by reversed- 
phase-HPLC (8). Each experiment was performed with three different preparations 
of porcine leukocytes.

Sheep seminal vesicles microsomes were isolated as described (9), and suspended 
in KH2P04 buffer (pH 7.4) before storing at -70°C in deviation from former experi- 
ments. After 5 min preincubation at 20°C with the inhibitor, 5.3 pg of microsomal 
protein were incubated for 20 min at 37 "C with 1 pM l-[14C]-arachidonic a id, 1 mM 
1-epinephrine bitartrate, 1 mM GSH, and 0.05 mM Na2EDTA in 2 ml of Tris-HCI buffer 
(pH 8.0).

Psychotria forsteriana A. Gray is a tropical 
plant endemic in the Vaté Islands. An alkaloidal extract of the 
leaves has been shown to be highly cytotoxic on cultured rat 
hepatoma cells (HTC). The isolation of its alkaloids have been 
reported. They are of the polyindolinic type and result from the 
condensation of several Nb-methyltryptamine units. These al- 
kaloids were also cytotoxic on rat hepatoma HTC and mice 
leukemic Llzlo cell lines (1,2). 
As a part of new developments on the phar- 
macognostical study of this genus, it seemed of interest to com- 
plete the study of the cytotoxic properties of this species by test- 
ing the biological activity of its different organs on other tumor 
systems. Alkaloid extracts of the different organs i.e. leaves 
(PFF), rootbark (PFER), stem bark (PFET) and fruits (PFFr) 
were tested on human leukemic (Molt4) and rat hepatoma 
(FAZA) cell lines. Moreover, some ofthe isolated alkaloids from 
these organs were also tested. 
Cell growth or survival was measured through 
the incorporation of 3H-thymidine (3HT). Thymidine being a 
precursor of the cells DNA, the amount of incorporated 3HT is a 
function of the cell multiplication. These are the first evalua- 
tions on these types of compounds by this method. 
The percentage of incorporation of thymidine 
by the Molt4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations 
of the different alkaloid extracts clearly shows that they all 
exhibit cytotoxic properties comparable to the toxicity found 
with the leaves' extract (PFF). Doses above lOpg/ml giving 
100% cellular mortality; the extracts are still very active at 
doses of 2 pg/ml. PFER (root bark extract) seems to be the least 
active at 2 pg/ml with 30 % of residual cells. These extracts 
seem unequally toxic to the cells. The difference in activity 
being probably related to differences in the amount, nature, 
and structure of their alkaloidal content. 
Microscopic observation of the FAZA cells after 
GIEMSA coloration corroborates these results. The cytotoxic 
properties can qualitatively be appreciated and one can ob- 
serve that the different extracts exhibit cytotoxic properties at 
doses of 10 pg/ml, with in most cases lysis of the cells.

The total alkaloid extracts were obtained as 
described in a previous communication (1). Comparison of the 
chromatographic profiles by TLC and HPLC showed some qual- 
itative and quantitative differences in the alkaloidal content. 
Nevertheless, there seemed to be some common alkaloids be- 
tween the extracts. Some major alkaloids from these extracts 
were isolated and identified on the basis of their spectral data 
in comparison with those found in the literature (1). These al- 
kaloids, some of which are new compounds, are also of the 
polyindolinic type. They are polymers consisting of two to five 
N,,-methyltryptamine units (Fig. 1). Numerous possibilities of 
isomerism exist on account of the great number of asymmetric 
carbons in these structures. Their activities on cell viabilitywas 
determined every 24 hours by counting the cells with a Neu- 
bauer microcytometer; the percentage of viability was mea- 
sured as a function of culture time by the Trypan blue exclusion 
test as reported for HTC cells (2). It appears that these alkaloids 
produce variable effects as a function of their structure and 
dose. The most active in most cases are the ones with the higher 
relative molecular mass. Thus, some structural features such 
as the number of tryptamine units composing the molecules 
and consequently their relative molecular mass, the mode of 
polymerisation, structural and stereoisomerism, seem veryim- 
portant for the activities of these compounds. Moreover, the 
cytotoxic effects seem to interfere with DNA synthesis.

These preliminary results on the human cell 
line Molt4 confirm the previously observed cytotoxic eff'ects of 
polyindolinic alkaloids on rat and mice tumor cell lines. 
Molt4 cells seem to be much more sensitive 
than rat hepatoma HTC cells. Lower doses are needed to 
achieve 100 % mortality. Moreover, Molt4 cells are much more 
adapted to this technique in which cell growth is measured as a 
function of incorporation of 3H-thymidine. This method is very 
convenient, rapid, more sensitive, and requires no particular 
skill. Both methods of evaluation i.e. classical microcytometer 
counting and 3HT incorporation give similar responses. The ac- 
tivity on FAZA cells also confirms the cytotoxic properties of 
these substances. These alkaloids are cytotoxic in vitro in the 
micromolar range to both human leukemic and rat hepatoma 
tumor cell lines. 
Moreover, their activities are a function of 
their structure and doses. More results on the stereochemistry 
of these compounds should allow us to establish some structure 
activity relationships. Further experiments in progress in our 
laboratory strongly support the evidence that these alkaloids 
can be considered as potent cytotoxic antitumoral agents in 
vitro. 
Materials and Methods 
Molt, 
Cytotoxicity tests were performed on human 
leukemic Moltl cells (established from the peripheral blood of a 19 year 
old male patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T-cell origin) cul- 
tured in suspension in a RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % 
V N  foetal calf serum (GIBCO). The assays were performed in multiwell 
plates: in each well were added successively the tested substance then 
the cells (2 x 105/ml). After 24 hours ofincubation at 37°C in COzatmos- 
phere, radioactive thymidine C3HT) (0.5-1 pCi/well) AMERSHAM TRA 
120, specific activity 5Ci/mM was added. After 40 minutes ofincubation 
at 37 "C, the radioactivity was measured. The results are expressed as 
the percentage of incorporation of 3H-thymidine in relation to the con- 
centration of the test substance (pg/rnl). 
FAZA 
The rat hepatoma cells (FAZA) are cultured in 
DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % calf serum to form an adhe- 
rent monocellular layer after 4 days of incubation at 37°C. Test sub- 
stances were added and the cells were incubated for 48 hours. The cells 
are observed after GIEMSA coloration under the microscope (x 300). 
Extraction 
Plant extracts were obtained through a classical acid 
base extraction procedure. The alkaloids were isolated by column 
chromatography and semi-preparative HPLC and were identified on 
the basis of their spectral data in comparison with those found in the lit- 
erature (1).
