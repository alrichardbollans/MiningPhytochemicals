Thymus quinquecostatus, with more medical value, is a kind of wild plants. In order to exploit and utilize this plant, we studied
the species and locations of alkaloids in its leaves. In this paper, histochemical study of leaves at different developing stages was
taken to localize the alkaloids. Meanwhile, the kinds and content of alkaloids in leaves were identified using GC-MS technique. It
was found that there were two kinds of glandular trichomes, namely, peltate trichomes and capitate trichomes, on the surface of
leaves, and their secretory cells could secrete alkaloids. Results showed that trichomes could secrete alkaloids as soon as the first
pair of leaves formed, and there were altogether 18 kinds of alkaloids identified by GC-MS. Nearly all of these alkaloids of leaves at
different developing stages were distinct from each other, except one, 3-methoxy-a-methyl-benzeneethanamine, persists at different
developing stages with high concentration.
1. Introduction
Plants may synthesize many secondary metabolites, which
can help plants survive and reproduce in the natural envi-
ronment [1]. Alkaloids are a group of important secondary
metabolites. They are relatively simple molecules and are
present in plants at <10 g/kg [2]. Many alkaloids are toxic,
which are used for plants to protect themselves against the
aggression from other organisms, and this instinct action is
an important ecological function. Alkaloids can be produced
by a large variety of organisms, especially most abundant
in higher plants. At least 25% of higher plants contain
these metabolites [3]. Many kinds of alkaloids are effective
ingredients in most medicinal plants, so that they are applied
in the treatment of diseases in traditional herbal medicine.
Alkaloids, with obviously physiological activity, have lots
of functions, such as anesthesia, analgesia, antibacterial
and antiviral effects, antineoplastic activity, antihypertensive
effect, insecticidal action, and so forth. They have already
been applied in widespread use in the medical and agricul-
tural industries [4–8]. So alkaloids have been and continue to
be the object of human interest concerning new possibilities
for their safe utilization and ensuing health benefits [3].
Some plant families, such as Apocynaceae, Papaveraceae,
and Ranunculaceae are especially rich in alkaloids [9]. The
Lamiaceae, a big family, contains more than 3500 kinds of
plants, and there are many species, such as Mentha haplo-
calyx, Perilla frutescent, and Lavandula angustifolia, notable
for their essential oil in this family [10, 11]. Except essential
oil, plants in this family can also produce alkaloids, for
example, leonurine and stachydrine, withmany physiological
functions [12, 13].Thymus quinquecostatus, commonly called
thyme, is a scrubby subshrub of Thymus in Lamiaceae, and
this kind of plant has ornamental and medical value, such as
anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. In some regions
of China, people often burnThymus quinquecostatus to keep
off mosquitoes. There are many glandular trichomes on the
leaf surface, and they can secrete essential oil, phenols, and

flavone [14].Whenwe studied the development and excretion
of trichomes, we found that the leaves could also secrete
alkaloids. The purpose of the present work was to have
a preliminary study on the alkaloids of leaves at different
developing stages.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials. Thymus quinquecostatus were collected from
LaoshanMountain ofChina in September 2013, and then they
were cultured in the plant laboratory of Qingdao Agricultural
University. The oval leaves of them are opposite. The fresh
young leaves (the first couple and the second one from the
top), nearly mature leaves (the third couple from the top),
and the mature leaves (the forth couple from the top) were,
respectively, picked. The length and width of blades were
measured with a vernier caliper. In the experiment, three
replicates of leaves from three plants were measured.
2.2. Histochemical Identification of Alkaloids
2.2.1. Blade Staining Method. Whole fresh leaves at different
developing stages were separately put on a glass slide and
dyed with a few drops of improving Dragendorff reagent
for 2–4 minutes. Then they were rinsed with distilled water.
After covered with a coverslip, leaves were observed with an
OLYMPUS BH-2 microscope. Undyed mature leaves were as
control.
2.2.2. Frozen Section Staining Method. Fresh leaves at differ-
ent developing stages were separately embedded in agar (4%)
and sectioned (20𝜇m) with a MICROM HM525 freezing
microtome. The leaf sections were covered with a few drops
of improving Dragendorff reagent for 20–30 seconds. Then
they were rinsed with distilled water. After covered with a
coverslip, the sections were observedwith anOLYMPUSBH-
2 microscope. The undyed section of a mature leaf was as
control.
2.3. Alkaloids Analysis. 0.9 g leaves at different developing
stages was picked and naturally dried. The dried leaves
were extracted with CH
2
Cl
2
for 4 times, and at each time
there were ultrasonic extraction for 30 minutes and solvent
extraction for an hour and a half. The ultrasonic condi-
tions were 30KHz, 150W, and 25∘C. The extracts were
mixed four times and concentrated by a rotary evaporator.
The volume was metered to 5mL with CH
2
Cl
2
. The alka-
loids were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS
(Agilent 7890A/5975C, Swindon, UK) was equipped with
an DB-5 capillary column (50 × 0.32mm ID × 0.25 𝜇m
film thickness) and the data were taken under the following
conditions: initial temperature 40∘C, temperature ramp 15∘C
permin, to 300∘C (holding for 5min).The autosampler trans-
ferred the liquid sample directly to the column. The carrier
gas was helium and the velocity was 1.0mL permin.Themain
components of the qualitative and quantitative results were

Table 1.
3.2. Histochemical Localization of Alkaloids in Leaves of
Thymus quinquecostatus. Under the microscope, two kinds
of glandular trichomes on blades could be seen on surface
view. They were capitate trichomes and the peltate trichomes
(Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The capitate trichome, which con-
sisted of a basal cell, a stalk cell, and a unicellular head, was
small (Figure 1(c)). The width of its head was about 16.81 𝜇m.
The peltate trichome, which consisted of a basal cell, a stalk
cell, and a multicellular head was large (Figure 1(d)). The
width of its head containing 12 secretory cells was about
61.20 𝜇m.
Both capitate trichomes (Figure 2(a)) and peltate tri-
chomes (Figure 2(b)) were orange after dyed with Dragen-
dorff reagent. The epidermis of leaves was colourless. From
transverse section view of a mature leaf, we could see that the
secretory cell of a capitate trichome was covered with intact
cuticle. The interior of a secretory cell showed yellow after
dyed with Dragendorff reagent, but the basal cell and the talk
cell were nearly colourless (Figure 2(c)).The head of a peltate
trichome was also covered with cuticle, yet the cuticle had
cracked.The interior of 12 secretory cells showed yellow after
dyed with Dragendorff reagent, the basal cell and the talk
cell were nearly colourless (Figure 2(d)). This was the same
with the capitate trichome. Except secretory cells of glandular
trichomes, other parts, such as mesophyll cells and leaf veins,
were not dyed yellow.
Leaves at different developing stages were dyed with
Dragendorff reagent.The alkaloids were produced at an early
stage. They could be seen in trichomes of the first couple of
young leaves. The capitate trichomes were easier dyed than
the peltate trichomes (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). As the dying
time went on, the peltate trichomes showed yellow too, but
the color was shallow (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). The transverse
sections of young leaves showed that the secretory cells of
both the capitates trichomes and the peltate trichomes were
yellow. As the leaves gradually grew to bemature, the coloring
time of capitate trichomes was very closed to that of peltate
trichomes (Figures 3(e) and 3(f)).

3.3. Alkaloids in Leaves. Leaves at different developing stages
of Thymus quinquecostatus had different kinds of alkaloids
(Table 2). In Total eighteen kinds of alkaloids were identified
in leaves. Young leaves had nine kinds of alkaloids and
the content of 3-phenyl-piperidine was the highest, 11.49%.
Nearly mature leaves had six kinds of alkaloids and the con-
tent of 3,7-Dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-yl 2-aminobenzoate was
the highest, 3.70%. Mature leaves had eight kinds of alkaloids
and the content of 3-methoxy-a-methyl-benzeneethanamine
was the highest, 3.52%, and this kind of alkaloids could be
commonly found in leaves at different developing stages.
There were seven kinds of alkaloids in the young leaves,
three kinds of alkaloids in the nearly mature leaves, and four
kinds of alkaloids in the mature leaves that were unique to
alkaloids in other developing stages of leaves, respectively.
It can be implied that with the development of leaves, great
changes had taken place in the kinds of alkaloids in glandular
trichomes.
4. Discussion
Alkaloids can be found in many plant organs, such as roots,
stems, leaves, fruits, and seeds. Dhale studied alkaloids in
three species: Adhatoda zeylanica, Ruta graveolens, and Vitex
negundo. It was shown that alkaloids existed in the epidermis,
mesophyll cells, and parenchyma cells of the leaf veins [15].
The histochemical studies of leaves of Mimusops elengi and
Syzygium cumini showed that alkaloids could be observed
in the mesophyll cells of leaves of two species [16]. There
are a lot of glandular trichomes on the surface of leaves in
many species of plants. Glandular trichomes are renowned as
prolific “chemical factories” for either synthesizing or storing
plant metabolites as chemical defenses [17], and alkaloids
are one kind of important materials in them. Abiola had
extracted a new kind of alkaloid from glandular trichomes
on leaves of Mucuna pruriens [18]. Nicotine mostly existed
in the trichomes of Nicotiana, such as Nicotiana tabacum
and Nicotiana stocktonii [19, 20]. From these researches, we
could see that alkaloids of leaves are mainly distributed
in epidermis (protective tissue), parenchyma, and secretory
structures. In our studies, the alkaloids of leaves of Thy-
mus quinquecostatus could be observed in the glandular
trichomes. Both peltate trichomes and capitate ones secreted
alkaloids. At the early developing stage of leaves, alkaloids
could be found in the young trichomes. We did not find
insects or diseases either in wild plants or in cultivated plants
in laboratory during the investigation process. It is still not
clear whether this phenomenon is related to the alkaloids
of Thymus quinquecostatus, so the method of pathology is
valuable for further study. In addition, the difference of
alkaloids between two kinds of glandular trichomes on leaves
ofThymus quinquecostatus also needs further study.

Alkaloids have a wide distribution in the nature, and
nearly 10 thousands of alkaloids have been found. They can
be classified as organic amine alkaloids, piperidine alkaloids,
indolizidine alkaloids, quinolizidine alkaloids, pyrrolizidine
alkaloids, izidine alkaloids, pyrrolidine alkaloids, tropane
alkaloids, indole alkaloids, and so on [3]. The distribution
of alkaloids has specificity in plant taxa. There may be large
differences among alkaloids in the plants of one family, but
alkaloids may be similar in the species of the same genus.
For example, reserpine, one kind of indole alkaloids, which
has antihypertensive effect, is produced by the plants of the
genus Rauvolfia (Apocynaceae) [21]. Morphine, an isoquino-
line alkaloid, which has analgesic and anesthetic effect, is
produced by the plants of the genus Papaver (Papaveraceae)
[22]. Cephalotaxine, which has remarkable anticancer effect,
is produced by plants of the genusCephalotaxus (Cephalotax-
aceae) [23]. But for the moment, little research has been
done on the alkaloids of plants in the Labiatae. Research
showed that leonurine, which is an organic amine alkaloid
and has been widely used, is mainly produced by plants in the
genus Leonurus [24]. The plants of Labiatae can also produce
other kinds of alkaloids, like hederacine A and hederacine
B [25], phenolic alkaloids [26], diterpenoid alkaloids [27],
and so on. In this paper, the results indicated that nearly
all kinds of the nine alkaloids in young leaves of Thymus
quinquecostatus were organic amine alkaloids, except one,
3-phenyl-piperidine, belonged to piperidine alkaloids, and
all of the six kinds of alkaloids in nearly mature leaves and
6 The Scientific World Journal
seven kinds of alkaloids in mature leaves belonged to organic
amine alkaloids. So organic amine alkaloids are dominant in
the alkaloids ofThymus quinquecostatus, but whether organic
amine alkaloids are the main type of alkaloids produced by
plants of Labiatae requires further study.
