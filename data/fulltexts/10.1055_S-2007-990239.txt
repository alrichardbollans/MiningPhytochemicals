Abstract: 
Extracts of milk thistle (Silybum marianum, Asteraceae), termed "silymarin," are used worldwide, primarily for 
hepatoprotective applications and recently for prostate cancer chemoprevention. Silymarin is a mixture of at 
least eight compounds, and four major constituents are a group of structurally related flavonolignans: silybin A, 
silybin B, isosilybin A, and isosilybin B. The initiation of in vivo studies to compare the respective preclinical 
activities of each compound required that gram quantities of these diastereoisomers be prepared. Procedures 
were developed and optimized to produce multigram-scale quantities of each of these in >97% purity. A hybrid 
chromatographic precipitative technique was developed, whereby mixtures were chromatographed at high 
concentrations so as to induce formation of a precipitate in the column fractions, yielding samples that were 
more enriched in the desired compounds than would be obtained solely by the chromatographic steps alone. 
 
Article: 
Introduction 
Milk thistle [Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (Asteraceae)] has been used since antiquity, especially for 
hepatoprotection against alcohol, Amanita mycotoxins, and other xenobiotics [1]. Since 1997, members of our 
team have explored its cancer chemopreventive properties, especially against models of prostate and other 
epithelial cancers [2]. Milk thistle extracts influence numerous cellular effectors to inhibit tumor cell 
proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [3]. Largely, these studies have examined milk thistle as 
either a complex mixture of at least eight compounds [4], termed 'silymarin', which is a series of seven 
structurally-related flavonolignans and the flavonoid, taxifolin [5] (Fig.1), or as an approximately equal mixture 
of the two most prominent flavonolignans [6], termed silibinin, which consists of the diastereoisomers silybin A 
and silybin B [5]. Although the chemistry of the constituents in milk thistle has been explored since the late 
1950 s (reviewed in [7]), members of our team were the first to isolate and characterize all seven of the 
flavonolignans [silybin A (1), silybin B (2), isosilybin A (3), isosilybin B (4), silychristin (5), isosilychristin (6), 
and silydianin (7)] [8]; a similar isolation study focusing on compounds 1-4 was described subsequently [9]. 
 
As is well known to this audience, an ongoing question in the examination of herbal drugs is whether the 
mixture or isolated compounds are responsible for the biological activity of an herb [10]. This can now be tested 
in milk thistle, since all of the individual components have been isolated on the milligram scale yielding enough 
material for cell culture studies [8], In an in vitro study, we found that 4 was generally the most potent anti-
proliferative compound across three prostate carcinoma cell 
 
 
lines, but that three other flavonolignans (1-3) each had equal or lesser potency as well [I1]. Currently, we are 
expanding upon those results in a series of mechanistic in vitro and in vivo models of prostate cancer [12]. A 
phase I dose-escalation clinical trial with a silibinin-phosphatidylcholine mixture revealed that plasma 
concentrations of flavonolignans can be achieved in the range where in vitro antiproliferative activity has been 
observed (25 -100 µM); however, to do so, doses of 5 to 13 g/day were required [13]. To further examine the 
effects of the flavonolignans in preclinical and clinical settings, both as defined mixtures and as isolated 
constituents, new methods were necessary to isolate gram-scale quantities of each diastereoisomer. While 
developing these, several unanticipated empirical observations led to optimized procedures to prepare 
multigram-scale quantities of compounds 1-4, all in greater than 97% purity. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Chemicals and instrumentation 
HPLC-grade solvents were purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI, USA). Large-scale separations 
were accomplished with a CombiFlash Companion flash chromatography system (Teledyne-Isco; Lincoln, NE, 
USA) using an Isco reverse- phase C-18 column (130 g). HPLC was carried out concurrently on three Varian 
Prostar HPLC systems (Walnut Creek, CA, USA) equipped with Prostar 210 pumps. Two of these utilized 330 
photodiode array detectors (PDA), with data collected and analyzed using Star Chromatography Workstation 
software (version 5.52). The other system utilized a 335 PDA, with data collected and analyzed using Galaxie 
Chromatography Workstation software (version 1.9.3.2). For preparative HPLC, YMC ODS-A (5 Fun; 250x25 
mm) columns were used with a 7 mL/min flow rate, while for analytical HPLC, YMC ODS-A (5 µ 5µm; 150x 
4,6 mm) columns were used with a 1 L/min flow rate (both from Waters; Milford, MA, USA). For analytical 
HPLC, MetaTherm HPLC column temperature controllers (Varian) maintained these columns at 27 °C. 
 
Plant material 
Powdered extract (1 kg; Product No. 345066, Lot No. 37501) of the seeds (achenes) of Silybum marianum (L.) 
Gaertn. was obtained from Euromed, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain), which is a part of the Madaus Group (Cologne, 
Germany). 
 
Analytical HPLC 
The purity of isolates was determined via analytical HPLC using a gradient that started at 30:70 MeOH-H20 and 
increased to 70:30 over 20 min. Chromatograms were observed at 280 nm, and the samples were dissolved in 
MeOH. The generation and 
 
 
 
characterization of reference standards from milk thistle, including the determination of chromatographic 
retention times, has been described previously [5], [8], [11]. 
 
Results 
Milk thistle literature is somewhat confusing, especially in pharmacology studies, clue largely to inconsistencies 
in the nomenclature of extract versus mixtures versus pure compounds. We have reviewed this recently [5] and 
others have voiced similar concerns [14]. Briefly, in all discussions herein, silymarin refers to the crude mixture 
of eight compounds shown in Fig.1, silibinin refers to a roughly equal mixture of 1 and 2, and isosilibinin refers 
to a roughly equal mixture of 3 and 4. 
 
The top of Fig. 2 displays an analytical scale HPLC chromatogram of the silymarin extract that was used as 
starting material in the following purifications. As we reported previously, this extract consists of silybin A (1; 
16.0%), silybin B (2; 23.8%), isosilybin A (3; 6.4%), isosilybin B (4; 4.4%), silychristin (5; 11.6%), isosily-
christin (6; 2.2%), silydianin (7; 16.7%), and taxifolin (8; 1.6%) [11]. To prepare silibinin and isosilibinin, 
fractionation of powdered silymarin (6.0 g dissolved in 9 mL of DMSO/chromatography for 42 
chromatographies) was initiated using the CombiFlash system via a MeOH-H20 gradient from 30:70 to 65:35 
over 11.5 column volumes (Fig. 2). Precipitates were evident in many fractions upon elution, and fractions from 
all 42 separations were pooled by their relative ratios of silibinin to isosilibinin to yield ten pooled fractions (A 
series). These stood for several clays (typically 3— 5) at room temperature to ensure complete precipitation. 
Three groups of fractions were filtered separately to obtain precipitates A-IP (40.5 g), A-2P (36.4 g), and A-3P 
(4.2 g) and supernatants A-1S (7.4 g), A-2S (19.1 g), and A-3S (14.8 g). Precipitates A-1P and A-2P were 
washed extensively with 100% MeOH to produce MeOH-insoluble fractions [A-1PP (30.4 g) and A-2PP (24.7 
g)], which consisted primarily of silibinin. The corresponding MeOH-soluble fractions [A-1PS (10.1 g) and A-
2PS (1I.7 g)] were dried, and upon resuspension in MeOH, a significant quantity of silibinin failed to go into 
solution, was removed by filtration [creating fractions A-1 PSP (3.7 g) and A-2PSP (4.3 g)], thereby yielding 
fractions enriched in isosilibinin, termed A1PSS (2.3g) and A-2PSS (6.5 g) [15]. A series of fractions were 
combined to form the starting material for the purification of compounds 3 and 4 (fraction B-1), and this was 
first filtered to remove more MeOH-insoluble silibinin [fraction B-1P (4.4 g)], yielding isosilibinin-enriched 
fraction B-1 S (50.2 g). in summary, two major fractions were created, fraction A-1PP (silibinin), which was 
carried forward to generate compounds 1 and 2, and fraction B-15 (isosilibinin), which was carried forward to 
generate compounds 3 and 4. 
 
To prepare silybin A (1) and silybin B (2), approximately 12g of fraction A-I PP were purified via RP-HPLC 
using an isocratic MeOH-H20 system (52:48; Fig.2). Each separation utilized 75 mg of A-1PP dissolved in 
DMSO (98 µL) to give an injection volume of 150µL, and this was repeated 154 times to afford silybin A (1; 
4.1 g) and silybin B (2; 4.9 g), each >98% pure. 
 
To prepare isosilybin A (3) and isosilybin B (4), fraction B-1S (50.2 g) was purified over C-I8 using MeOH-
H20 via the CombiFlash system, initiating with an isocratic system (47:53) over 8 column volumes, followed by 
a gradient to 50:50 over 3 column volumes, and concluding with a wash of 100% MeOH for 2 column volumes. 
Each separation utilized 4.2 g of B-15 dissolved in 9 mL DMSO, repeating a dozen times to yield ten pooled 
fractions (C series; Fig. 3). As with the initial separations described above, a key component was the formation 
of a precipitate, which in this case was enriched with isosilibinin. Fraction C-3P was purified further by RP-
HPLC using an isocratic MeOH-H20 system (50 : 50). Each separation utilized 485 mg of C-3P dissolved in 
DMSO (634 µL) to give an injection volume of 970 µL, and this was repeated ten times to yield eight pooled 
fractions of both supernatants and precipitates (D series). Precipitate D-1P (602 mg) afforded isosilybin A (3) in 
> 99% purity. Fraction D-51
3
(413 mg) and fractions from other C-series fractions further enriched with a 
similar ratio of isosilybin A:isosilybin B (2652 mg) were purified by RP-HPLC using an isocratic solvent 
system of MeOH-H20 (50:50). Each separation utilized 153 mg dissolved in DMSO (200 L) to give an injection 
volume of 306 AL, and this was repeated 20 times to yield the E series of fractions, all of which had various 
ratios of compounds 3:4, In particular, fraction E-11
3
 resulted in another aliquot of 3 (285 mg), and fractions E-
4P and E-5P were combined to yield isosilybin B (4; 1239 mg; >97% pure). Residual fractions from the C, D. 
and E series were recycled and purified iteratively in a similar manner to generate in total 4.4g of 3 and 3.7 g of 
4, both at >97% purity. 
 
Discussion 
Using these optimized purification procedures, it is possible to generate gram quantities of each diastereoisomer 
within a few months. This is in contrast to our earlier chemical research on milk thistle, where it took nearly a 
year to isolate these diastereoisomers on the milligram to hundreds-of-milligram scale [8], [11]. Although a few 
papers have emerged recently on the chromatography of milk thistle on the analytical scale, especially for 
quantification purposes [16], [17], [18], [19], to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the 
isolation of these diastereoisomers on the multigram-scale, thereby affording much needed study materials for 
detailed in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evaluation. 
 
Of all the diastereoisomers, the rate-limiting step was the gram- scale isolation of isosilybin B (4), and two 
empirical observations were critical for its eventual purification. First, chromatographic resolution, even during 
preparative scale flash chromatography, was greatly enhanced by dissolving the injected study sample in a 
minimum amount of DMSO. As a rough guide, we multiplied the weight of the study material (in mg) by 1.3 to 
determine the optimum volume of DMSO (in µL). Secondly, using these supersaturated materials, two types of 
precipitates would form almost immediately upon column elution. In the initial steps (Fig. 2), the precipitate 
consisted largely of silibinin. Fig. 4 compares the supernatant (A-1S) versus the precipitate (A-1P), and from 
this, it should be evident why compounds 1 and 2 were isolated readily. We could have isolated many more 
granas of each of these, but instead, focused on the much more challenging purification of compound 4. In fact, 
earlier researchers have alluded to recrystallizing silymarin to generate silibinin [20]. Perhaps more importantly, 
removing as much silibinin as possible via precipitation was critical to the eventual purification of compounds 3 
and 4. When the supernatant with low silibinin content was further purified (Fig. 3), new types of supernatant 
(C-3S) vs precipitate (C-3P) were realized. As shown in Fig. 5, this precipitate was largely isosilibinin, which 
served readily as starting material for the isolation of pure 3 and 4. In short, supersaturation of starting materials 
afforded precipitation in column fractions, and in doing so, permitted the rapid isolation of gram-scale 
quantities of all compounds, especially compound 4. 
 
In conclusion, our collective research goal is to determine the biological effects of milk thistle compounds, both 
as single entities and defined mixtures, as prostate cancer chemopreventives. To do so, it was critical to develop 
methods to prepare gram-scale quantities of each diastereoisomer. With these materials in hand, several in vitro 
and in vivo studies are progressing. For example, isosilybin A (3) and isosilybin B (4) exert profound growth 
inhibitory effects in androgen-dependent human prostate carcinoma cells by suppressing regulatory proteins 
required for entry into the G1 -S phase of the cell cycle [12]. These pure compounds also trigger apoptosis by 
causing activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and suppression of the inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin. While 
isosilybin B (4) was a slightly more potent growth suppressor, isosilybin A (3) was a more effective apoptosis 
inducer, and both had minimal effects on non-neoplastic human prostate epithelial cells. These interesting 
results are being explored using human prostate carcinoma xenografts in vivo and are ongoing at the time of 
publication. Therefore, the availability of the pure compounds is beginning to permit dissection of the che-
mopreventive and anticancer actions reported previously for the crude mixture silymarin and the partially 
purified silibinin [3].
