Da casca do caule de Picramnia teapensis Tul. foram isolados dois novos benzoatos
triterpênicos, o 3,7-dibenzoato do ácido lup-20(29)-en-28-óico e o 7-benzoato do ácido 3-
hidroxi-lup-20(29)-en-28-óico. A elucidação estrutural desses compostos foi fundamentada na
análise dos dados espectroscópicos. Outros compostos conhecidos, -sitosterol, estigmasterol,
lupeol e epilupeol, foram identificados em mistura por CG-EM. Nenhum dos triterpenos
benzoilados mostrou efeito inibitório no crescimento in-vitro do Leucoagaricus gongylophorus
(Fisher), também citado como Leucocoprinus gongylophorus (Heim), syn Rozites gongylophora
(Möller), o fungo simbionte cultivado pelas formigas cortadeiras de folhas Atta sexdens L.
Two new benzoic acid esters of triterpene alcohols [lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 3,7-dibenzoate
and 3-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 7-benzoate] were isolated from the stem bark of
Picramnia teapensis Tul. The structures of these compounds were established on the basis of
spectral analyses. Other known compounds, -sitosterol, estigmasterol, lupeol and epilupeol, were
identified in mixture by GC-MS. The triterpene esters have not shown in-vitro inhibitory effect on
the growth of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Fisher), referred also as Leucocoprinus
gongylophorus (Heim), syn Rozites gongylophora (Möller), the symbiotic fungus cultivated by
the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens L.

Introduction
The genus Picramnia is restricted to the neotropic
region. According to Engler, the genus Picramnia belongs
to Simaroubaceae, but Fernando & Quinn have promoted
Picramnia to a new family named Picramniaceae1.
We have previously described our findings on the
chemical study of P. teapensis, a tree found in Central
America2, 3. The study of the ethyl acetate extract of the
stem bark from this plant has led to the isolation and
characterization of two C-glycosylated anthrones
(picramniosides D, E); two C-glycosylated oxanthrones
(mayoside and mayoside B); a C,O-diglycosylated anthrone
(picramnioside F); a C,O-diglycosylated oxanthrone
(mayoside C); two anthraquinone glycosides (1-O--D-
glucopyranosyl emodin and 8-O--D-glucopyranosyl
emodin) as well as emodin and umbelliferone2,3. Some of
them showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus
gongylophorus the symbiotic fungus cultivated by the leaf-
cutting ants Atta sexdens L3. These ants are known as
serious pest in agriculture and forestry in Brazil4. During
the last decade we have been looking for a natural control
of this pest without ecological injury, working on toxicity
and repellence of plant extracts and plant products
potentially toxic to Atta and their symbiotic fungus5-7.
This report deals with the isolation and identification
of new lupane triterpene benzoates, from the chloroform
extract of the stem bark from P. teapensis and the test of
antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.
Results and Discussion
The chloroform extract from the stem bark of P.
teapensis afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of
Triterpene Benzoates from the BarkVol. 12, No. 3, 2001 387
compounds 1 and 2, which were separated by column
chromatography on silica gel. The lupane triterpenes
benzoates 1 and 2 were identified on the basis of
spectroscopic data, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and
HMBC experiments. Compound 1 was identified as lup-
20(29)-en-28-oic acid 3,7-dibenzoate and compound 2,
in minor quantities, was identified as 3-hydroxy-lup-
20(29)-en-28-oic acid 7-benzoate by comparison of 1H
and 13C NMR data with those of compound 1.
Compound 1 had a molecular formula C44H56O6, as
determined by 13C NMR and DEPT analysis and confirmed
by HREIMS. The IR spectrum of 1 exhibited bands at 3428
cm-1 ( O-H, broad), 2929 cm-1 (terminal methylene
function), 1713 cm-1 ( C=O of ester function), 1274 cm-1,
1114 cm-1 ( C-O) and 713 cm-1 (aromatic ring). The 1H
NMR spectrum of 1 displayed six signals for methyl groups
at  0.93, 0.95, 0.96, 1.18, 1.31 and 1.69. This last value
suggested the presence of one methyl group attached to an
unsaturated carbon. Furthermore, vinylic protons signals
appeared at  4.74 (1H, d, J 1.6 Hz) and  4.61 (1H, s) and
the signal for one allylic proton appeared at  3.01 (broad
td, J 11.1, 4.6 Hz). The spectrum also showed two
acycarboxylic protons at  4.87 (broad t, J 2.6 Hz) and 
5.40 (dd, J 10.1, 5.2 Hz). Signals at  7.46-8.10 (10 H)
showed the typical pattern of the benzoate group (Table
1), the integration indicating the presence of two benzoate
groups.
The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 confirmed the nature of
the triterpene skeleton, as a lup-20(29)-ene triterpenoid
structure, with signals of the terminal olefinic bond at 
150.3 and 109.8. Key signals indicated other functional
groups of the lupane skeleton: i) the signal at  179.3
corresponding to a carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid
function, ii) two carbonyl carbons of conjugated ester
functions ( 166.0 and 165.8) and aromatic signals
corresponding to the benzoic ester ring, and iii) two signals
of carbinolic carbons ( 78.7 and 77.6). The assignments
of 13C and 1H RMN spectra are shown in Table 1 and the
data are supported by the DEPT, COSY, HMQC and HMBC
experiments. These assignments are comparable with those
of structures with the same skeleton previously reported8.
The location of the benzoate groups was established as
follows: the signal at  4.87 (broad t, 2.6 Hz), corresponding
to H-3, showed correlation with the carbonyl of the
benzoate at  166.0 in the HMBC experiment and the
coupling constant indicates an equatorial position of this
proton, so the benzoate group must be . The shielding
effect suffered by C-1 ( 34.2) and C-5 ( 49.2) confirmed
the relative configuration at C-3. The position of the
benzoate at C-7 was determined by the observation of the
correlations, in an HMBC experiment (Table 2), of the
protons at Me-26 with C7, C-8, C-9 and C-14, and also of
H-7 with C-26. The high shielding effect observed for the
methyl at C-26 ( 11.7) is reported for skeletons with
hydroxyl or esterification in the  position at C-78, 9. The
coupling constants exhibited by H-7 (5.2 and 10.1 Hz)
indicate that it must be axial, so the relative configuration
at C-7 is with the benzoic ester in the  position.
EIMS data of compound 1 exhibited the expected ester
fragmentation, benzoic acid being a prominent eliminated
product, with fragments at m/z 558 ([M-PhCO2H]) and m/z
436 ([M-2PhCO2H]). The molecular ion peak at m/z 680,
the base peak at m/z 105 ([C6H5CO]+), and other important
fragments at m/z 635 ([M-HCO2H]), 248, 202, 201, 188,
187 and 173 were observed (Figure 1). The fragmentation
pattern strongly indicated the nature of the lup-20(29)-ene
with esterifications at rings A/B.
Compound 2, C37H52O5, exhibited the same
spectroscopic characteristics as 1, with exception of those
of ring A, having the following main 1H and 13C NMR data
differences: the spectra showed the presence of only five
aromatic protons showing the characteristic pattern of a
benzoic group; the signal for H-3, in a  orientation,
appeared as a shielded broad triplet at  3.42. Therefore
the signal of C-2 ( 25.4) was deshielded and the C-3 signal
( 75.9) shielded in comparison with the signals in 1, as
occurs in other lupanes with 3--hydroxyl8.
Compound 2 was isolated in too small amount to observe
all the quaternary carbons by 13C NMR. 1H and 13C NMR
attributions shown in Table 1 are consistent with the
observations made in DEPT 135 and HMBC experiments.
The correlations observed by HMBC were basically from
the six methyl groups on the lupane skeleton (Table 2). The
correlation of C-26 and C-2' with H-7 confirmed the position
of the benzoic ester. Some signals were attributed by
comparison with the data of compound 1.

Triterpene Benzoates from the BarkVol. 12, No. 3, 2001 389
The EIMS spectrum of compound 2 did not show the
molecular ion peak because of the lost of benzoic acid.
Some of the observed fragments were at m/z 454 ([M-
C6H5CO2H]), m/z 122 ([C6H5CO2H]+.) and m/z 105
([C6H5CO]+), being the base peak at m/z 77 ([C6H5]+). The
fragmentation pattern shown in Figure 1 was also observed
as in compound 1.
The chloroform extract from the stem bark of P. teapensis
also afforded a mixture of -sitosterol, stigmasterol, lupeol
and epilupeol which were identified by GC-MS and by
comparison of EIMS spectra and co-injection in GC of
authentic samples available in our laboratory.
Compounds 1 and 2 were tested in the growth inhibition
assay of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, using the
methodology described by Pagnocca et al.5. These new
compounds have not shown inhibitory effect against growth
of L. gongylophorus at concentration of 100 g mL-1. 1-
O--D-Glucopyranosyl emodin and 8-O--D-gluco-
pyranosyl emodin, isolated from this plant, were used as
positive controls since they showed complete inhibition of
the fungus growth at a concentration of 50 g mL-1 3.

Plant material
The stem bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa
Rica, in the region of San José de la Montana in September
1990 and identified by Dr. Luis Jorge Poveda. A voucher
(CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the
Universidad Nacional of Costa Rica, Heredia.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents
Dried and powdered stem bark of P. teapensis (615 g)
was macerated with EtOH 80%. The extract was filtered
and concentrated under vacuum, and part of it (10.3 g)
was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. VLC fractionation
of the concentrated chloroform layer (2.37 g) on silica gel
was carried out, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2 and CH2Cl2-
MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 50 fractions,
25 mL each. These fractions were combined in 12 groups
on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction 5 (107.3 mg) was
crystallized in CH2Cl2/acetone and its constitution was
analyzed by GC-MS. Four compounds were identified from
this fraction: -sitosterol, estigmasterol, lupeol and
epilupeol10. Fraction 6 (160.8 mg) was submitted to
chromatographic separations on silica gel columns using
as eluents hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, and yielding the
triterpene benzoates 1 (10.2 mg) and 2 (1.0 mg).
