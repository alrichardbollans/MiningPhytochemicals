and Seyed Mohammad Nabavi2*Abstract
Medicinal and edible plants play a crucial role in the prevention and/or mitigation of different human diseases from
ancient times to today. In folk medicine, there are different plants used for infectious disease treatment. During the
past two decades, much attention has been paid to plants as novel alternative therapeutic agents for the treatment
of infectious diseases due to their bioactive natural compounds such as phenol, flavonoids, tannins, etc. The genus
Eryngium (Apiaceae) contains more than 250 flowering plant species, which are commonly used as edible and
medicinal plants in different countries. In fact, some genus Eryngium species are used as spices and are cultivated
throughout the world and others species are used for the treatment of hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, asthma,
burns, fevers, diarrhea, malaria, etc. Phytochemical analysis has shown that genus Eryngium species are a rich source of
flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and triterpenoids. Moreover, eryngial, one the most important and major compounds of
genus Eryngium plant essential oil, possesses a significant antibacterial effect. Thus, the objective of this review is to
critically review the scientific literature on the phytochemical composition and antibacterial effects of the genus
Eryngium plants. In addition, we provide some information about traditional uses, cultivation, as well as phytochemistry.

Infectious diseases are known as one of the most im-
portant leading causes of long and short–term morbidity
and mortality worldwide [1, 2]. According to the World
Health Organization, in 2011, infectious diseases were
responsible for approximately 18 million deaths world-
wide. In addition to the high prevalence of infectious
diseases, there are some microorganisms resistant to
antibiotic therapy, which lead to the increase of death
rate due their ability to acquire and transmit drug re-
sistance [2]. Nowadays, antibiotic resistance is known
as one the most important and challenging health prob-
lems in the global health programs. Therefore, during
the past two decades, much attention has been paid to* Correspondence: Nabavi208@gmail.com

of scientific evidence reported that edible and medicinal
plants have significant potential to synthesize anti-
microbial agents as their defense mechanisms against
biotic stresses such as microorganisms [10]. It has been
reported that plant-derived antimicrobial compounds
can be categorized into the different groups such as
phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, lectins, polypeptides,
polyacetylenes as well as alkaloids [11]. In addition, in
traditional medicine, many edible and medicinal plants

Erdem et al. DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences  (2015) 23:53 Page 2 of 22The genus Eryngium contains more than 250 flowering
species worldwide [13]. Genus Eryngium is the largest and
most complex genus in Apiaceae family [13, 14]. Some
species in the genus Eryngium are endangered such as E.
alpinum L., E. aristulatum Jeps., E. constancei M.Y. Sheikh,
E. cuneifolium Small, and E. viviparum J. Gay [13, 14]. Ac-
cording to the morphological studies, the genus Eryngium
has been classified into five subgenera, including Eryngium
subgenus Eryngium, E. subgenus Monocotyloidea, E.
subgenus Fruticosa, E. subgenus Semiaquatica, and E. sub-
genus Foetida [15, 16]. E. subgenus Eryngium is the most
common one throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, while
the other subgenera are widely distributed in Australia
[15, 16]. However, infrageneric analysis through se-
quence data of chloroplast DNA trnQ-trnK 5’-exon and
nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS regions showed that there
are two different subgenera including Eryngium and
Monocotyloidea [17–19].
Like the other members of Apiaceae family, the genus
Eryngium plants have various culinary and/or medicinal
uses (Fig. 1) [20–23]. Several species have been widely
used in traditional medicine such as E. foetidum L., E.
caucasicum Trautv. (syn. Eryngium caeruleum M. Bieb.),
E. maritimum L., E. planum L., E. dichotomum Desf., E.
campestre L. and E. creticum Lam. [24–27], whereas E.
foetidum and E. caucasicum have been widely cultivated
in some Asian countries such as Iran, Turkey, etc. [27, 28].Fig. 1 Some of species from Eryngium genus, Eryngium campestre L. (a), Eryng
Eryngium falcatum Delar. (d), Eryngium kotschyi Boiss. (e), Eryngium maritimumE. caucasicum is known as one the most common edible
leafy vegetables in northern part of Iran and widely used
in different foodstuff, pickles, etc. [28, 29]. Besides, the
fruits of E. foetidum are known as common edible food
components in Nigeria [30]. Actually, some Eryngium spe-
cies are also used as ornamental plants [31]. A mountain
of scientific evidence has shown that different species of
the genus Eryngium possess antimicrobial effects under
in vitro and in vivo conditions [32–36].
Therefore, the present paper aims to review the scien-
tific literature on the phytochemical composition and
antimicrobial activities of essential oils and extracts ob-
tained from genus Eryngium species. In addition, we
discuss about traditional uses, cultivation and phyto-
chemistry of Eryngium species to provide a complete
picture of this genus.
Materials and methods
Data sources and search strategy
Data were collected from Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, Web
of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), Science Direct,
Embase, and BIOSIS Previews (from 1950 to July 20, 2015),
via searching of these keywords: “Eryngium and phyto-
chemistry or chemical compounds”, “Eryngium and anti-
bacterial”, “Eryngium and antimicrobial”, and “Eryngium
and biological effect”. We also scanned the reference
list of each paper and searched Cochrane review library.ium davisii Kit Tan & Yildiz (b), Eryngium isauricum Contandr. & Quezel (c),

screened for further publications. Finally, collected data
were analyzed and judged by second and third authors
according to the scientific standard of conduct. However,
some of the references may be published after the initial
search date July 2015.
Traditional uses
In traditional medicine, some of Eryngium species have
been used for treatment of several human diseases
[24–27]. It has been reported that E. campestre L. is
widely used as antitussive, stimulant, aphrodisiac, and
diuretic agent in Turkish traditional medicine [37, 38].
E. caucasicum is one of the most important edible
plants in the northern part of Iran due to its multiple
beneficial effects on human health [29, 31, 39, 40].
Moreover, E. creticum has been used as hypoglycemic
plant in the Jordanian traditional medicine [41], while
E. elegans Cham. & Schltdl. has been reported to be
utilized as diuretic agent in the Argentinian traditional
medicine [42]. Most of Eryngium species are also
known as medicinal plants worldwide for the treat-
ment of several human diseases such as diarrhea,
gastrointestinal problems, bladder and kidney dysfunc-
tions, and venereal diseases [24–27, 43–45]. In Chinese
traditional medicine, E. foetidum is widely used for
treatment of inflammation [24] and E. yuccifolium
Michx. roots have been traditionally used to treat
snakebites, toothache [27, 46, 47], digestive problems,
diarrhea, headache, etc. [24–27, 43–45]. A large scale
of evidence has pointed out to multiple pharmaco-
logical effects of the genus Eryngium species including
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihemolytic, antino-
ciceptive effects, and protective agent against neurode-
generative deseases [25, 28, 48–50]. For instance,
Eryngium planum, which is a rare medicinal plant, was
studied to determine the effect of subchronic adminis-
tration of a 70 % ethanol root extract (200 mg/kg, p.o.)
on behavioral and cognitive responses in experimental
animals (Wistar rats) linked with the expression levels
of mRNA coding for enzymes such as acetylcholin-
esterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and
beta-secretase (BACE-1). At the end of the experiment,
after the last dose of the Eryngium extract, scopolamine
(SC) was administered intraperitoneally to a group of ani-
mals (treated). In the animals treated with the Eryngium
extract, an improvement in long-term memory produced
by the EP extract in both scopolamine treated and control
group was registered with decreased mRNA AChE,
BuChE, and BACE-1 levels, especially in the frontal
cortex, suggesting the potential efficacy of this extract
in this kind of pathologies [25, 28, 48–50].
This is only an example of the fact in the las decade
some investigations have been carried out to demonstratethe potential pharmacological activity of Eryngium species
extracts [51, 52].
Cultivation
Several genus Eryngium species have been widely used
as edible plants in many countries and, consequently,
mainly cultivated as an economic crop in tropical areas
of the world [24, 28, 29]. In fact, numerous reports refer
to the ideal and effective conditions for cultivating, har-
vesting as well as post-harvesting conditions of Eryn-
gium species [24, 31, 53]. In the northern parts of Iran,
E. caucasicum is one of the most important garden vege-
tables, which is mostly used in preparation of foodstuff,
pickles, etc. [28, 29]. It has been reported that some
Eryngium species are easily cultivated in dry, sandy,
well-drained soils, and full sun [24, 31, 53]. Root cut-
tings are a common protocol for propagation of Eryn-
gium species [24, 31, 53–55], which can also be
propagated using other plant cuttings [24, 31, 53–55].
In addition, there is a close correlation between Eryn-
gium species growth and fertilizer levels in the soil
[24, 31, 53–55]. However, Eryngium species are signifi-
cantly endangered by plant diseases as well as insect at-
tacks [24, 31, 53–55].
Phytochemistry
Based on the review of the literature up to now, the aerial
parts of Eryngium species have been reported to contain
mainly saponins, flavonoids, and essential oil, while the
underground parts contain triterpene saponins, monoter-
pene glycosides, phenolic compounds such as flavonoids
and phenolic acids, coumarin derivatives, terpene alde-
hyde esters, acetylenes, essential oil, and oligosaccha-
rides [56–60].
Saponins
The Eryngium species are the rich sources of triterpene
saponins (Tables 1 and 2). Most of the saponins isolated
from Eryngium species possess mainly hydroxylated
oleanane-type aglycons such as A1-barrigenol (1), R1-
barrigenol (2), or barringtogenol C (3) (Fig. 2). In
addition to these core structures, cameliagenin A (4),
erynginol A (5) and B, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid,
and steganogenin (6) having glucose, glucuronic acid,
rhamnose, xylose, galactose, and arabinose moieties
have been also found in various Eryngium species (Fig. 2).
The general saponin structures possess generally acetic,
angelic, dimethylacrylic, and tiglic acid substituents, lo-
cated predominantly at C21, C22 or C28 positions. On
the other hand, isovaleric, n-butyric, and methyl butyric
acids occur relatively rare substituents. Saponin glyco-
sides found in Eryngium species are usually monodes-
mosidic saponins, where the bidesmosidic ones contain
sugar groups at C3 and C28 positions [59, 61–65].

Erdem et al. DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences  (2015) 23:53 Page 4 of 22The first phytochemical studies performed on the
genus Eryngium starting from early 1970s were focused
on their saponin content. According to the survey of the
literature data published between 1970–1978 and in
1985, the identification of the isolated compounds was
limited to the absolute definition of the aglycons with
possible positions of sugars and acyl substituents be-
cause of inadequate chemical facilities in structure elu-
cidation techniques [61, 66–68]. In this period, E.
planum, E. amethystinum L., E. giganteum M. Bieb.,and E. bromeliifolium F. Delaroche were studied in
more detail. As summarized in Table 1, A1-barrigenol
and R1-barrigenol-type of aglycons containing dimethy-
lacrylic, angelic, and/or tyglic acids as the acid moieties
were isolated from the roots of the E. planum, named
as eryngiumgenine A-D [69] of which only aglycon
types were identified and classified according to the Rf
values. Later, compound (5) was isolated from the aerial
parts of this species [70]. Further phytochemical studies
on the same plant were continued on the leaves and

Fig. 2 Saponin derivatives frequently found in Eryngium species
Erdem et al. DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences  (2015) 23:53 Page 7 of 22roots. These studies led to the isolation of a number of
aglycons with (4), (3), (2) types possessing acetic, tyglic,
butyric, and isovalerianic acids located at C16, C21,
C22 or C28 positions [71, 72]. Isolation of saponin agly-
cones such as (2) and (3), and saponins bearing (2) and
(3) skeletons, named as giganteumgenin A (7), B (8), C
(9), D (10), E (11), G (12), H (13), K (14), M (15), and
N (16) (Fig. 3), was achieved from the methanol extract
of the leaves of E. giganteum [67]. Another phytochemical
investigation on E. amethystinum led to isolation of the
saponins with main structures in (1), (2), (3), and (5) [68].
Other sapogenols isolated from various Eryngium speciesuntil 1978 are listed in Table 1 [58, 62, 72–74]. Many years
later, another R1-barringtogenol derivative with an acid
moiety and two glycopyranosyl moieties was reported
from E. planum roots by Voigt et al. in 1985 [75].
Most of the scientific articles concerning saponins of
the genus Eryngium remained limited to the identifica-
tion of the sapogenol type and determination of the acid
or sugar substituents. After the late 70’s, publications
concerning the saponins from the genus Eryngium have
become much more detailed as giving the whole struc-
ture elucidations as a result of the developments of
the techniques used for structure elucidation. For

a new oleanane-type triterpene saponin structure (17)
from the aerial parts of E. foetidum (Fig. 4). Kartal et al.
[59] characterized two new triterpene saponins (18,
19) from the roots of E. campestre bearing A(1) and
(2) types, and isolated five new triterpene saponins
(20–24), one of which was (1) and the others with (2)
main skeleton (Fig. 5) [63]. Another phytochemical
study performed on the whole parts of E. yuccifolium
was reported by Zhang et al. [64], who described the
isolation and identification of 12 new polyhydroxylated
triterpenoid saponins named as eryngiosides A-L (28–39)
and two known triterpenoid saponins {21β-angeloyloxy-3β-

species (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the root of E. yuccifoliumafforded two new polyhydroxyoleanene saponins
[eryngioside M (40) and N (41)], together with 15
known triterpenoid saponins (28–39; 42–44) eluci-

present in the roots of E. planum [76]. Detailed phyto-
chemical investigation on the roots of E. kotschyi Boiss.,
which is an endemic plant to Turkey, led to isolation of
two known and four new triterpene saponins (45–48)
(Fig. 7) [77].
Erdem et al. DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences  (2015) 23:53 Page 9 of 22Flavonoids
In an earlier study [78], isolation from E. planum of a new
flavonol glycoside (identified as kaempferol-3-O-(6-O-β-
D-glucopyranosyl)-β-D-galactopyranoside) was reported.
A phytochemical study on the aerial parts of E. campestre
led to the characterization of a new acylated flavonol
named as kaempferol 3-O-β-D-(2’-Z-p-coumaroylgluco-
side) (49) along with 10 known compounds including
tiliroside (50), kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucosyde-7-O-α-L-
rhamnoside (51), rutin (52), kaempferol (53), quercetin
(54), isorhamnetin (55), caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and
mannitol [58] as well as luteolin 7-glucoside [79] of which
some selected structures are given in Fig. 8. Using
UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS technique, quantification of a
number of flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin,
and their derivatives) and naringenin rhamnoglucoside (a
flavanone derivative) was performed in E. bourgatii GouanFig. 4 Structure of the (17) isolated from E. foetidumby Cádiz-Gurrea et al. [48]. Hawas et al. [80] isolated
11 flavonoid glycosides (including isorhamnetin 3-O-α-

from the aerial parts of E. campestre. Then, most re-
cently, Khalfallah et al. [36] characterized five flavon-
oid derivatives from the aerial parts of E. triquetrum

The first coumarin derivatives isolated from E. campestre
by Sticher & Erdelmeier [56] were agasyllin (56), grandi-
vittin (57), aegelinol benzoate (58), and aegelinol (59)
which structures are given in Fig. 9 [56]. The isolation of
marmesin tiglate [also known as nodakenetin (60), Fig. 10]
together with metetoin, a nitrogenous compound, was
achieved from E. ilicifolium Lam. [81].
Phenolic acid derivatives
Many Eryngium species have been reported to contain
phenolic substances. Le Claire et al. [82] characterized
chlorogenic (63), R-(+)-rosmarinic (61), and R-(+)-3’-O-β-
D-glucopyranosyl rosmarinic acids (62) in the roots of E.
alpinum through medium pressure liquid chromatography(MPLC) and preparative high pressure liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC) (Fig. 11). Besides, the presence of R-
(+)-rosmarinic acid and R-(+)-3’-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl
rosmarinic acid was also shown in several Eryngium
species which could be used as chemotaxanomic
markers specific to this genus. Two new caffeic acid de-
rivatives, i.e. 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl caffeate and (4-β-
D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-hydroxyphenyl caffeate, along
with a new flavonoid (kaempferol-3-O-(2-O-trans-p-
methoxycoumaroyl-6-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-β-D-gluco-
pyranoside) were isolated from the whole parts of E.
yuccifolium in addition to following known compounds,
i.e. caffeic acid and kaempferol-3-O-(2,6-di-O-trans-p-cou-
maroyl)-β-D-glucopyranoside [64]. Cádiz-Gurrea et al. [48]
also revealed presence of cinnamic acid derivatives

rivatives), benzoic acid derivatives (p-hydroxybenzoic acid
glucoside, arbutin, syringic acid, glucogallin, gentisic acid,
and their derivatives) and various organic acids (gluconic,
citric, quinic acids, and their derivatives) in E. bourgatii
using hyphenated advance liquid chromatographic sep-
aration techniques. On the other hand, catechin, epicat-
echin, chlorogenic, gallic, and rosmarinic acids were
determined quantitatively in the roots of E. palmatum
Pančić & Vis. [83]. In a similar study [60], chlorogenic,
hydroxybenzoic, and caftaric acids were detected in E.
bornmuelleri Nábělek along with trace amounts of caf-
feic, ferulic, and rosmarinic acids.Other types of compounds
Drake and Lam [84] reported the isolation of falcarinone, a
widespread acetylenic compound occurring in Apiaceae. 6-
Pentyl-2-[2-oxo-butin(3)-yliden]-tetrahydropyrane from the
aerial parts and roots of E. bourgatti and the acetylenic
compounds identified as Z and E isomers of the same com-
pound were also obtained from this species in addition
to falcarinone, falcarinolone, falcarinol, and scopoletin
[85]. Further phytochemical studies ensued in the
characterization of two new monoterpene glycosides of
the cyclohexenone type, elucidated as 3-(β-D-glucopyra-
nosyloxymethyl)-2,4,4-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one
and 3-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-2,4,4-trimethyl-2-
Fig. 7 Chemical structure of triterpene saponins

structure was established as 1-n-propyl-perhydronaphtha-
line 1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-4-methyl-1-propyl-naph-
thalene-7-carbaldehyde was reported from the aerial parts
of E. creticum [86], while new ester derivatives, character-
ized as cis-chrysanthenyl hexanoate and cis-chrysanthenyl
octanoate, were isolated from E. planum [87].
In order to find out the compounds possibly responsible
for the anti-inflammatory activity of E. foetidum, compos-
ition of the hexane extract from the leaves of this species
was subjected to GC and GC-MS analyses [88]. Hereby,
α-cholesterol, brassicasterol, campesterol, stigmasterol
(as the main component, 95 %), clerosterol, β-sitosterol,
Δ5-avenasterol, Δ524-stigmastadienol, and Δ7-avenasterolwere detected in the extract. Muckensturm et al. [89] re-
ported a phytochemical study performed on the diethyl
ether extracts from E. giganteum, E. variifolium Coss., E.
planum, and E. maritimum. Chromatographic separation
techniques applied to the seed extract of E. giganteum led
to the elucidation of a new nor-sesquiterpene hydrocarbon,
i.e. 15-nor-α-muurolene (gigantene), and germacrene-D,
trans-β-farnesene, 15-oxy-α-muurolene, 15-hydroxy-α-
muurolene, ledol, and spatulenol. Similar studies on the
seeds of the E. planum gave way to isolation of cis-chry-
santhenyl acetate, while isoferulyl senecioate and 2,3,4-tri-
methylbenzaldehyde were obtained from the leaves of E.
variifolium. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the latter
compound was considered as artifact by these authors. In

procedures which finally afforded trans-2-dodecanal
(eryngial) in pure form.
Essential oil
Essential oil compositions of numerous Eryngium species
have been investigated by many researchers. As illustratedwith their corresponding references in Table 3, a great in-
terspecies variation could be easily observed. However, the
most common monoterpenes analyzed in different plant
parts of Eryngium species have been as follows; germa-
crene D, α-pinene, caryophyllene, muurolene, α- and β-
selinene, limonene, α- and β-bisabolol, etc., whereas many
hydrocarbons and some aromatics such as trimethylben-
zaldehyde and dodecenal have been detected.Antimicrobial effects of the genus Eryngium plants
Plants are known to produce antimicrobial substances [10],
which act as plant defense mechanisms and protect them
against abiotic and biotic stresses. These antimicrobial
agents, which are often characterized by low adverse effects
and wide spectrum activities, belong to many chemical
classes such as phenolics and polyphenolics, terpenoids,
alkaloids, lectins, polypeptides, and polyacetylenes [11].
Among the plants belonging to the genus Eryngium,
some species exhibit considerable antimicrobial activity
against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, some
species of fungi and yeasts and viruses. Within this
genus, the most studied species has been E. foetidum,
which is cultivated across South Asia and Europe,
Tropical Africa, and Pacific islands. As regards the anti-
bacterial activity of E. foetidum extracts, the literature
data are conflicting. In fact, in 2003, Alzoreky and
Nakahara reported that the acetone and buffered methanol
extracts obtained from E. foetidum leaves did not show any
antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella
Fig. 11 Some phenolic acid derivatives found in E. alpinum
Erdem et al. DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences  (2015) 23:53 Page 14 of 22infantis, Listeria monocytogenes Tottori, Staphylococcus
aureus and Bacillus cereus [91].
More recently, Ndip et al. showed that the methanolic
extract form E. foetidum leaves showed moderate anti-
bacterial activity against 6 clinical strains of Helicobacter
pylori out of 15 tested strains, using the disk diffusion
technique as antibacterial susceptibility test [92]. Besides
antibacterial activity, E. foetidum was tested for its anti-
plasmodial activity, using chloroquine as positive control
to evaluate the sensitivity of susceptible Plasmodium
falciparum strains. The leaf extracts were prepared using
hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol to obtain three
extracts. The dried extracts were then dissolved in
DMSO to give a stock solution at 10 mg/mL, used for
the biological tests. The results indicated that E. foeti-
dum showed low in vitro antiplasmodial activity against
P. falciparum, with an IC50 value of 25 μg/mL [93].
Another species belonging to genus Eryngium, is E.
maritimum, which is a wild perennial species growing on
sand beaches in West Europe, the Mediterranean basin,
and the Black Sea and has been used for its diuretic,
stimulant, cystotonic, stone inhibitor, aphrodisiac, expector-
ant, and anthelmintic properties (http://www.botanicals.com,
http://www.crescentbloom.com). The essential oil, ob-
tained from hydrodistillation of the aerial parts, was found
to contain a known sesquiterpene (muurol-9-en-15-al)
and three new oxygenated sesquiterpenes with a muuro-
lane or cadinane skeleton (4βH-cadin-9-en-15-al,
4βHmuurol-9-en-15-ol, and 4βH-cadin-9-en-15-ol), The
sesquiterpenoid-rich fraction was tested in vitro using the
agar diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concen-
tration (MIC) in the liquid phase against L. monocytogenes
and E.coli. The finding revealed that the antibacterial
activity of the new oxygenated sesquiterpenes against
the tested bacteria, with an inhibition diameter higher
than 15 mm and a MIC value lower than 90 μg/mL [94].
Another investigation on E. maritimun showed that
the leaf hydromethanolic extract fractionated into a
polar (aqueous) and apolar (chloroformic) fraction and
tested using the microdilution method against food-borne pathogens and clinical isolates, exhibited anti-
microbial activity. The tested Gram-positive bacteria
were S. aureus subsp. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, L.
monocytogenes and B. cereus. The Gram-negative bac-
teria were two strains of Salmonella (S. enterica subsp.
arizonae and S. enterica subsp. montevideo), three
strains of Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens,
and P. marginalis), E. coli, and Erwinia carotovora subsp.
carotovora, and a yeast (Candida albicans). According
to the data obtained, the fractions resulted to be active
against all bacteria with the exception of L. monocytogenes,
while the most sensitive bacteria were P. aeruginosa and
P. fluorescens, with MIC values of 1 and 2 μg/mL for the
polar and apolar fractions, respectively [95].
The essential-oil composition and antimicrobial activity
of three other species belonging to genus Eryngium (E.
creticum, E. campestre, and E. thorifolium), whose infu-
sions obtained from the aerial and root parts are com-
monly used in Turkish folk medicine as antitussive,
diuretic, stimulant, and aphrodisiac, were studied [96].
The composition of E. thorifolium was found to be rich in
α-pinene, a known antibacterial terpenic compound,
which was present in fewer amounts in the other two spe-
cies. Differently, E. creticum was found to be rich in hexa-
nal, which was present in less amount in E. thorifolium
and was not detected in E. campestre. Antibacterial activity
of the essential oils was tested with the disc diffusion
method against nine clinical strains of methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA). The essential oil obtained from E. thori-
folium, which caused an inhibition zone ranging from 13
to 19 mm (similar to that exhibited by vancomycin and
oregano essential oil tested at 10 μL/disc and 5 μL/disc, re-
spectively), was demonstrated to be the most active species
[37]. As aforementioned, many Eryngium species, e.g. E.
maritimum exerted antifungal activity against C. albicans
and other strains. Especially, the essential oil obtained by
water distillation of the aerial parts of E. duriaei Gay ex
Boiss subsp. juresianum (M.Laínz) M. Laínz was tested for
its antifungal activity against 13 fungi, among which there
were seven dermatophyte species (Microsporum canis FF1,

and a strain of Cryptococcus neoformans CECT 1078.
Using the macrodilution broth method the MIC and
Minimal Lethal Concentrations (MLC) were deter-
mined. The results disclosed that the essential oil did
not possess antifungal activity against Candida strains,
with the exception of C. guillermondii, which resulted
to be sensitive to the antifungal activity of the oil with a
MIC and MLC of 2.5 μL/mL. On the contrary, the es-
sential oil had MIC values of 0.16–0.32 μL/mL against
all the tested dermatophyte species. The essential oil
was further studied to determine its chemical com-
position by GC-MS and the authors suggested that
caryophyllene derived compounds [isocaryophyllen-14-al (16.2 %), 14-hidroxy-β-caryophyllene (13.4 %), car-
yophyllene oxide (7.6 %) and E-β-caryophyllene
(6.3 %)] are probably the responsible for the antifun-
gal activity [97].
Finally, in 2013, the antiphytoviral activity of the es-
sential oils obtained by water distillation of the aerial
parts of E. alpinum and E. amethystinum cultivated in
Croatia was described. The antiviral activity was shown
in Chenopodium quinoa treated with the essential oils
(250 ppm) prior to the inoculation of cucumber mosaic
virus associated with a satellite RNA. The number of leaf

oils, was strongly reduced from an average value of
14.9 ± 0.8 to 3.3 ± 0.2 and 2.9 ± 0.2, for E. alpinum
and E. amethystinum essential oils, respectively. The
authors ascribed the antiviral activity to the occur-
rence of caryophyllene oxide and β-caryophyllene,
which were identified as the major components of E.
alpinum and E. amethystinum, respectively. Moreover,
other components such as germacrene D, α-bisabolol,

Conclusion
The present paper shows that essential oils and extracts
obtained from various Eryngium species have broad
range antimicrobial activity against several strains of
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, some species
of fungi and yeasts, and viruses. The findings point out
to the fact that these activities can be ascribed to the
presence of different phytochemicals, especially apolar
compounds. However, our search at https://clinicaltrials.-
gov/ with keyword “Eryngium” accessed on February 9,
2015 showed no clinical trial regarding the beneficial effects
of the genus Eryngium plants against different types of in-
fection available up to date. In addition, there are only a
few papers on the toxicity of the active constituents be-
longing to the genus Eryngium plants, which resulted
to be cytotoxic especially at high doses. It can be sug-
gested that more toxicity studies should be carried out
prior to the clinical trials.
According to this study, we conclude that the essential
oils and extracts of those Eryngium species that have
been submitted to in vitro investigation (Table 4) should
be proceeded to toxicological studies and in vivoexperiments as multi-target antimicrobial agents for
the treatment of human infectious diseases, especially
antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Thus, it is not
quite possible to make a clear statement or comment
about their clinical uses. Hence, we recommend that
future studies should be performed on:
- toxicity of the Eryngium plant extracts and essential
oil resulted to be active in in vitro experiments.
- clinical studies of the safe extracts of Eryngium
species with in vitro activity,
- finding the exact mechanism underlying the
antibacterial effects of the essential oils and extracts
of members of the genus Eryngium and their
antibacterial constituents,
- separation, isolation, and structure identification of
the most antibacterial constituents of the essential oils
and extracts of different members of the genus
Eryngium and their interactions with foods as well as
common synthetic antibacterial compounds,
- ascertaining the most effective and safe doses for
clinical studies regarding the antibacterial effects of the
essential oils and extracts of different genus Eryngium
species against different infectious diseases.Competing interests
