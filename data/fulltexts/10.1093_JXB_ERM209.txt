Abstract
Arabidopsis cell walls contain large amounts of pectins
and hemicelluloses, which are predominantly synthe-
sized via the common precursor UDP-glucuronic acid.
The major enzyme for the formation of this nucleotide-
sugar is UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, catalysing the
irreversible oxidation of UDP-glucose into UDP-gluc-
uronic acid. Four functional gene family members and
one pseudogene are present in the Arabidopsis ge-
nome, and they show distinct tissue-speciﬁc expres-
sion patterns during plant development. The analyses
of reporter gene lines indicate gene expression of
UDP-glucose dehydrogenases in growing tissues. The
biochemical characterization of the different isoforms
shows equal afﬁnities for the cofactor NAD
+ (;40 mM)
but variable afﬁnities for the substrate UDP-glucose
(120–335 mM) and different catalytic constants, sug-
gesting a regulatory role for the different isoforms in
carbon partitioning between cell wall formation and
sucrose synthesis as the second major UDP-glucose-
consuming pathway. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase is
feedback inhibited by UDP-xylose. The relatively (com-
pared with a soybean UDP-glucose dehydrogenase) low
afﬁnity of the enzymes for the substrate UDP-glucose is
paralleled by the weak inhibition of the enzymes by
UDP-xylose. The four Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehy-
drogenase isoforms oxidize only UDP-glucose as a
substrate. Nucleotide-sugars, which are converted by
similar enzymes in bacteria, are not accepted as sub-
strates for the Arabidopsis enzymes.
Key words: Cell wall precursor, gene expression, hemicellulose,
nucleotide-sugar, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.
Introduction
Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid but often ﬂexible cell
wall to counterbalance the high osmotic pressure inside
the cells. Therefore, plant growth requires extensive
synthesis of cell wall material during development. The
principal composition of Arabidopsis cell walls, analysed
from leaves of 4–5-week-old plants, was determined
previously (Zablackis et al., 1995). This study indicates
a high amount of pectic polymers and hemicelluloses,
together forming the matrix polysaccharides, in which
cellulose ﬁbrils are embedded along with cell wall
structural proteins. Matrix polysaccharides are synthesized
in the Golgi apparatus by polymer synthases, which
require nucleotide-sugars as glycosyl donors. Excellent
reviews of the complex nucleotide-sugar interconversion
pathways have been published recently (Gibeaut, 2000;
Reiter and Vanzin, 2001; Seifert, 2004). Based on
the study by Zablackis et al. (1995), one can calculate
that ;50% of the cell wall biomass is derived from
the precursor UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA). This
nucleotide-sugar is the direct precursor of UDP-galacturonic
acid after epimerization (Mølhøj et al., 2004; Usadel et al.,
2004), UDP-xylose and UDP-apiose after decarboxylation
(Kobayashi et al., 2002), and UDP-arabinose derived from
UDP-xylose by an epimerase (Burget et al., 2003). Plants
have evolved two independent pathways for the synthesis
of UDP-GlcA; this fact underlines the importance of this
nucleotide-sugar for plant growth. One pathway involves
the direct oxidation of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) into
UDP-GlcA by the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase
(UDP-a-D-glucose:NAD
+ oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.22;
UGD) (Tenhaken and Thulke, 1996). Alternatively, UDP-
GlcA can be formed in a more complex reaction via ring

subsequent activation of the sugar to UDP-GlcA (Loewus
et al., 1962; Seitz et al., 2000; Kanter et al., 2005).
Because of the unique entry enzyme of the pathway, myo-
inositol oxygenase (MIOX), this route is often referred to
as the MIOX pathway for UDP-GlcA formation.
The UGD enzyme uses UDP-Glc, available from photo-
synthesis assimilates, as a substrate. The major competing
alternative pathway for the consumption of UDP-Glc is the
synthesis of sucrose-6-phosphate by the enzyme sucrose-6-
phosphate synthase (SPS), which provides the precursor for
the major phloem metabolite sucrose (Winter and Huber.
2000). In addition, UDP-Glc may also be used directly as
a glycosyl donor for cellulose synthase or for the formation
of callose at the plasma membrane.
UGD oxidizes the C6 carbon of glucose from an alcohol
to a carbonic group in two subsequent oxidation reactions
with no release of intermediates (Ge et al., 2004). The
overall reaction is energetically irreversible, with the
consequence that UDP-GlcA can be used exclusively for
the synthesis of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, gluc-
uronylation of secondary compounds, and post-translational
modiﬁcation of glycoproteins. The separation of the
nucleotide-sugars into a pool of mostly cell wall-speciﬁc
precursors (UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalA, UDP-Ara, UDP-Xyl,
and UDP-apiose) and a pool used for the synthesis of
storage compounds (sucrose) and cell walls (UDP-Glc and
UDP-Gal) raises the question of which UDP-sugar(s) feed
into the cell wall precursor pool (Seifert, 2004). Whereas
UDP-Glc is undoubtedly the major substrate for UGDs, it
is discussed controversially whether UDP-galactose could
be a direct precursor of UDP-galacturonic acid for pectic
polymers (Stewart and Copeland, 1998).
The ﬁrst gene for a eukaryotic UGD was cloned from
soybean (Tenhaken and Thulke, 1996). From measuring the
enzymatic activity and analysing public DNA databases, it is
evident that UGD genes are present in almost all organisms,
with the exception of a few with a secondarily reduced
genome like the yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae.O f t e n
several isoforms of UGD are present in plants, a ﬁnding
which has only been studied in maize so far (Karkonen
et al., 2005). Most papers on plant UGDs have either
ignored the existence of isoforms or performed a combined
analysis of several isoforms simultaneously. Here the
analysis of the UGD gene family of Arabidopsis is reported
to give a comprehensive overview of the gene expression of
different isoforms and their biochemical properties.
Materials and methods
Bioinformatics
To identify all UGD-like genes from Arabidopsis the public
databases in GenBank were searched. All expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences with high similarity to UGD could be assigned to
one of the four UGD genes present in the sequenced Arabidopsis
genome.
A ﬁfth UGD gene with a weaker similarity was detected at the
top of chromosome 3. A detailed analysis suggested a partial se-
quence of an additional UGD gene (UGD5). To rule out any
assembling error in the genome project, the genomic situation for
this region was veriﬁed by PCR. The primers GCCGGAACAG-
GATTAGGCTT and CTAGAGGAGACGCCTGTAAC from the
ﬂanking neighbouring genes ampliﬁed a product of the predicted
size (1381 bp) according to the data in the genome project.
Reporter gene analysis
The promotor sequences of UGD1, 2, 3, and 4 were ampliﬁed by
PCR using the primer combinations given in Table 1. Genomic
DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana was used as template. PCR
products were cloned in front of the uidA gene of vector pBI101
(Clontech MountainView, CA, USA) (UGD1, 2, and 3) or pGreen
(http://www.pgreen.ac.uk) (UGD4) via the relevant restriction
cleavage sites.
Cloning products were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing (Seqlab,
Go ¨ttingen, Germany) and plasmids were transferred into Agro-
bacterium tumefaciens GV 3101. Subsequently, A. thaliana Col-
0 plants were transformed by the ﬂoral dip method developed by
Clough and Bent (1998). Several independent transformants were
stained for b-glucuronidase (GUS) activity and a typical line was
chosen for detailed analysis.
For reporter gene analysis, seedlings were grown sterile on 0.53
MS medium (#M0245, Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Nether-
lands), pH 5.7 (KOH) with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.25% (w/v)
Phytagel  (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or on soil in growth
chambers (23  C, 50% relative humidity). Plants were cultured
either with an 8 h light period (ﬂuorescent bulbs ;100 lEm
 2
s
 1) or in the dark. Seedlings of different developmental stages and
distinct plant tissues were collected and stained with X-Gluc for
GUS activity for 5 min–16 h, using the protocol of Jefferson
(1987). Plants were photographed with a Leica stereo microscope
(Leica MZFL III, Solms, Germany), equipped with a digital camera
(Canon PowerShot S40). Pictures were assembled in Adobe Photo-
shopCS 8.0.1.
Total RNA isolation and real-time PCR
For total RNA isolation, seedlings were grown sterile on MS plates
in growth chambers for 6 d with 8 h light periods or in the dark as
described above. About 100 mg of plant material (light-grown
seedlings, etiolated seedlings, roots, and cotyledons/hypocotyl of
seedlings) were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homoge-
nized by a ball mill (Retsch MM200, 3330 s, frequency 30 Hz).
Total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol/guanidinium thiocya-
nate method (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). First-strand cDNA
was synthesized by using a RevertAid  M-MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase Kit (Fermentas GmbH), according to the supplier’s
protocol, and 3 lg of total RNA.
Real-time PCR was performed using 1 ll of a 1/20 (v/v) dilution
of ﬁrst-strand cDNA reaction, 13 reaction buffer [10 mM TRIS-
HCl pH 8.5, 50 mM KCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM MgCl2
(Karsai et al., 2002)], 200 lM dNTPs, 200 nM of each primer,
SYBR green (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) diluted to a 1:200 000
concentration, and 1.5 U of Taq (total reaction volume 30 ll) using
a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR system (Statagene, La Jolla, CA,
USA). For primer oligonucleotide sequences, see Table 1. PCR was
conducted using the following ampliﬁcation conditions: 94  C for
3 min, 403 [94  C for 30 s, 65  C( UGD1 and 3), 57  C( UGD2),
or 58  C( UGD4) for 45 s, 72  C for 1 min], 95  C for 1 min,
65  C for 30 s. Each primer pair ampliﬁed a single product, as
indicated by the melting curve of the amplicons. The resulting CT
3610 Klinghammer and Tenhakenvalues were normalized to the average of the Ct values of the
transcript of the housekeeping gene ubiquitin-5 (At3g62250)
(Karsai et al., 2002) ampliﬁed under the following conditions:
94  C for 3 min, 403 (94  C for 15 s, 56  C for 20 s, 72  C for
20 s), 95  C for 1 min, 65  C for 30 s.
Expression vector constructs
For cloning into expressions vectors, the open reading frame (ORF)
of each UGD was ampliﬁed by PCR (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA
Polymerase Kit, New England Biolabs) using the primer combina-
tions listed in Table 1 and full-length EST clones as templates:
UGD1, M77J01; UGD2, AV43959; UGD3, 43C9T7; and UGD4,
105N9T7 (Arabidopsis Stock Center). The PCR products were
cloned into pQE31 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany; UGD2–4) or into
pET21a (UGD1) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) via the relevant
restriction cleavage sites. Each construct was conﬁrmed by DNA
sequencing (Seqlab, Go ¨ttingen, Germany).
The expression vector constructs were co-transformed with
pGroESL (Amrein et al., 1995) into the Escherichia coli expression
strain Origami  (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany).
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
The E. coli expression strains were routinely grown in LB medium
containing 100 lgm l
 1 ampicillin, 34 lgm l
 1 chloramphenicol,
20 lgm l
 1 tetracyclin and 50 lgm l
 1 kanamycin at 37  C
overnight, inoculated at 1/100 dilution in LB medium (antibiotics
as above), and cultured to an OD600 of ;0.4 under vigorous
shaking. After cooling the cultures for 15 min at room temperature,
protein expression was induced by addition of 500 lM isopropyl-b-
D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cultures were grown at 23  C
for a further 20 h.
After cooling the cultures by shaking for 15 min on ice, cells
were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 4500 g and 4  C) and
frozen in liquid nitrogen after discarding the supernatant. Sub-
sequently, cells were thawed in 10 ml g

10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
NAD
+, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF, disolved in
isopropanol)] by vigorous vortexing. Lysozyme at 200 lgm l
 1 and
1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 were added and shaken slowly on ice for
45 min to disrupt bacterial cells gently. Bacterial debris was removed
by centrifugation for 10 min at 14 500 g and 4  C. The supernatant
was transfered into a new tube; 2.4 U ml
 1 benzonase nuclease HC
(Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was added and incubated for 15 min
by shaking slowly on ice. The clear supernatant was applied to a Ni-
NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with
NTA-1 buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0,
250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM NAD
+], after addition of
250 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 5 vols of NTA-1 buffer
and 5 vols of NTA-2 buffer (NTA-1 buffer with 20 mM imidazole)
to remove all weakly bound proteins. UGD proteins were eluted by
addition of 2.5 vols of NTA-3 buffer (NTA-1 buffer with 250 mM
imidazole). The enzymes were immediately transfered into storage
buffer [20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.7, 50 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
0.5 mM NAD
+] by gel ﬁltration on a PD10 column (Amersham
Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany). The enzymes could be stored at
–80  C (>6 months) after being frozen in liquid nitrogen without any
reduction in activity. UGD protein puriﬁcation was veriﬁed by SDS–
PAGE.
The yeast strain Toy4, expressing a His-tagged version of
Arabidopsis UGD1, was a kind gift of Dr Y Jigami. UGD1 was
expressed and puriﬁed from a yeast extract according to Oka and
Jigami (2006).
Enzyme assays and kinetic analysis
The enzyme activity of UGD was determined photometrically at
340 nm (Beckmann photometer DU640) by the increase of NADH.
The assays were performed for 1–10 min at room temperature in
assay buffer [40 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.7, 0.8 mM EDTA, 16% (v/v)
glycerol, 0.8 mM NaN3]. For the determination of kinetic parame-
ters, (i) saturated concentrations of NAD
+ (500 lM) and various
concentrations of UDP-glucose (0.01–1.5 mM) were used; or
(ii) various NAD
+ concentrations (0.01–1.5 mM) and a constant

Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene family 3611UDP-glucose concentration (2 mM) were used. The amount of
the UGD added was based on enzymatic activity and was set to
0.03 OD340 units change per minute. The ﬁnal reaction volumn was
set to 1 ml. Triplicate values were obtained for each measurement,
and data were plotted with Microcal Origin 6.0G Professional. The
Km values were calculated from the hyperbolic curve using the
least-square algorithm of the Origin-software.
Product analysis
The substrates and products of UGD enzyme assays were analysed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Dionex U3000
system) using ion-pair chromatography on an RP18-column
(Prontosil 120 C18 AQ-Plus 15033 mm). Separation was per-
formed in buffer A (25 mM tetraethylammonium acetate; pH 6) for
8 min, followed by a linear gradient to 25% buffer B (buffer A plus
20% acetonitrile) for 10 min using a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min

MP-Biomedical; UDP-Gal, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UMP were
purchased from Sigma.
Results
Identiﬁcation of the UGD genes in Arabidopsis
In Arabidopsis,t h eUGD gene family is represented by four
transcribed members (UGD1–4) and one pseudogene (UGD1,
At1g26570; UGD2, AT3g29360; UGD3, At5g15490; and
UGD4, At5g39320). The Arabidopsis UGD described
earlier (Seitz et al. 2000) is termed UGD2 herein. The
four UGDs encode very similar proteins of 480–481 amino
acids. The difference (including conserved exchanges) in
the amino acid sequence is <10% between the four iso-
forms (Fig. 1). The schematic structure of the (pre)-mRNA
Fig. 1. Schematic structure of primary RNA transcript protein sequences for UGD genes. (A) All four UGD genes contain a single intron in the 5’
untranslated region, represented by small boxes. The larger boxes represent the ORFs of UGD1–4. Each single amino acid change from the
consensus sequence is represented by a black line in the ORF. The double-headed arrow above the sequences shows the NAD
+-binding site. The
downward pointing arrows above the sequences indicate the cysteine residue essential for catalyis in all UGDs. The upward pointing arrows below
the bars indicate the position of all amino acids involved in glucose binding of UDP-Glc, which are positionally conserved between the UGDs from
Arabidopsis and the UGD from Streptococcus pyogenes, for which a crystal structure is available (Campbell et al., 2000). (B) The table shows the
percentage amino acid identity (left lower triangle) or similarity (right upper triangle) between the four different UGD isoforms. The sequences of
UGD2, 3, and 4 are highly similar, but UGD1 differs signiﬁcantly from the other sequences. (C) Aligment of some plant UGD sequences with

intron of variable length in the 5’ untranslated region
whereas the full ORF is not disrupted by further introns.
The amino acid sequence variations between the four
isoforms are not uniformly distributed along the whole
sequence and between all isoforms. Clustering of amino
acid exchanges occurs between different pairs of UGDs,
indicating that a simple recent gene duplication event does
not account for the four UGD isoforms in Arabidopsis.
Based on the crystal structure of a UGD from Strepto-
coccus pyogenes (Campbell et al.,2 0 0 0 ) ,a l lo ft h ea m i n o
acid residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis are
absolutely conserved between the enzyme from bacteria
and plants. The residues involved in binding the UDP-
glucose are highlighted schematically in Fig. 1. Several
plant UGD sequences were aligned using ClustalX to
generate a bootstrapped Neighbor–Joining tree (Fig. 1C).
The tree indicates a close proximity of ArabidopsisU G D 2 ,
3, and 4, which cluster together with a UGD from soybean,
but puts Arabidopsis UGD1 on a different branch. UGDs
from rice cluster into groups of the same branch. Similarly,
the two sequences from tobacco, Pinus tadea,a n dPopulus
each group together, suggesting gene duplication events
after speciation. Further UGD sequences of EST libraries
were not included because in many cases the algorithm for
generating UNIGENE sequences in GenBank puts sequen-
ces from different isoforms into a single data set (e.g. tested
for soybean; data not shown).
The pseudogene is lacking about two-thirds of the
coding sequence including the NAD
+-binding site, which
is essential for catalytic activity. The chromosomal loca-
tion at the very beginning of chromosome 3 suggests a
segmental gene duplication during evolution, as indicated
by the doubling of 37 recognized ORFs (At3g01010–
At3g02020) matching a highly similar region on chromo-
some 5 (At5g15510–At5g14060).
Expression pattern of UGD genes in Arabidopsis
Promoter::GUS fusion constructs were used in stably
transformed Arabidopsis plants to compare gene expres-
sion patterns of UGD1–4. The homozygous transgenic
lines were analysed for each construct and a typical line
was selected for a detailed analysis of the reporter gene
activity. The pattern of the most abundantly active re-
porter UGD2::GUS is shown in Fig. 2 (compare also
Fig. 4). UGD2::GUS activity is seen ﬁrst during the
germination process in 1-d-old seedlings, when the radicle
breaks through the seed coat (Fig. 2a). In seedlings up to
5 d old, the activity of UGD2::GUS is restricted to the
primary root (Fig. 2b). In particular, UGD2::GUS activity
can be detected in roots tips, in young root hairs, and in
the calyptra. In further growth phases, cotyledons show an
even but low activity of the UGD2::GUS reporter gene,
which is still highest in the roots (Fig. 2c, d). This pattern
remains similar for the vegetative phase of the life cycle
(Fig. 2e). Growth of seedlings in the dark leads to etiolated

shown. Seedlings were grown in light (a–e, g–k) or dark conditions (f): (a) 1-d-old seedlings; (b) 3-d-old seedling; (c) cotyledons of a 7-d-old

Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene family 3613and elongated hypocotyls showing a strong UGD2::GUS
activity in the hypocotyl (Fig. 2f). This reporter gene
activity is absent in light-grown seedlings (Fig. 2b). In
roots of etiolated seedlings a similar expression pattern to
that of light-grown seedlings can be detected. During
germination and the vegetative phase of the life cycle, a
close correlation between growth, requiring UDP sugars
for the synthesis of matrix polysaccharides, and the activity
of the UGD2::GUS reporter is generally seen. The more
complex pattern of UGD2::GUS activity in ﬂowers and
siliques is shown in Fig. 2g–k. In young ﬂowers,
UGD2::GUS activity can only be detected in the pistil. At
later development stages, sepals and petals also show
reporter gene activity (Fig. 2g). Also, UGD2::GUS activity
is found in staminiferous and mature pollen (Fig. 2h).
Siliques show UGD2::GUS activity in the abscission zone
at the base and close to the top (Fig. 2k). No UGD2::
GUS activity was observed in developing embryos or seeds.
In general, the expression patterns of UGD2, 3, and 4
are very similar. However, UGD1 shows an expression
pattern which is distinct from that of the other isoforms. A
comparison of the activity of the different UGD reporter
gene constructs is shown in Fig. 3. In seedlings up to 4 d
post-germination, UGD2, 3, and 4::GUS activity can only
be detected in roots (Fig. 3a). This is in contrast to an
almost inverse organ-speciﬁc pattern seen for UGD1::
GUS (Fig, 3a). At 5 d post-germination this effect dis-
appears. Furthermore, in young leaves, UGD1 and UGD4::
GUS show a cell type-speciﬁc activity in guard cells and
in basal cells surrounding each trichome (Fig. 3e, f). All
isoforms exhibit reporter gene activity in 3–4-week-old
leaves at a low level, and differences in the activity
pattern become visible again in the reproductive phase.
Activity of all UGD::GUS reporter genes is seen in the
stigma, the ﬁlaments, and the mature pollen (Fig. 3b, c).
However, the activity of UGD1::GUS is limited to these
tissues. UGD3 and 4::GUS reporter are also active in the
ﬂower bases. Only UGD2::GUS shows a strong activity
in sepals and petals, and in pollen sacks (Fig. 3b, c). In
developing siliques, the vascular system shows UGD1, 2,
and 3::GUS activity (Fig. 3e, f), and UGD2, 3, and
4::GUS are strongly expressed in the abscission zone at
the base of siliques (Fig. 3d).
Further analyses of expression of UGD genes in
Arabidopsis via real-time PCR indicate that UGD2 is
usually expressed at the highest level of all UGD genes in
seedlings (Fig. 4, upper panel). In roots of seedlings, UGD2
and 3 are expressed at a very similar high level, while
UGD4 is expressed only weakly and no UGD1 transcripts
can be detected. Furthermore, in cotyledons and hypo-
cotyl, UGD2 expression dominates again, in addition to
lower levels of UGD3. Publicly available microarray data
from AtGenexpress were also analysed. The RNA for the
microarray hybridization was from 7-d-old hypocotyls and
17-d-old roots. The relative transcript amounts for each
UGD gene are similar to our own data shown in the upper
panel (Fig. 4, lower panel). As seen before with the re-
porter gene constructs, UGD1 expression can be demon-
strated in cotyledons and hypocotyl. In etiolated seedlings,
UGD2 and UGD3 are predominantly expressed.
Expression of recombinant UGD in E. coli
UGD converts UDP-Glc into UDP-GlcA and is located at
a critical partitioning step for carbohydrates between the
storage compound sucrose via the enzyme SPS and
building blocks for matrix polysaccharides via the enzyme
UGD. To obtain a deeper insight into the biochemical
properties of the different UGD isoforms, the individual
enzymes were expressed as recombinant proteins in
E. coli by cloning the ORF of each UGD isoform into a
His-tag expression vector. Though UGDs from different
sources have been investigated as recombinant proteins, it
was found to be necessary to optimize thoroughly the
expression conditions for each of the highly homologous
isoforms. Modiﬁcations of the procedure for soybean
UGD expression in E. coli (Hinterberg et al., 2002) pro-
duced an adequate amount of active UGD2, 3, and
4 enzymes. An SDS–PAGE of the puriﬁed recombinant
proteins, used for enzymatic analysis, is shown in Fig. 5.
Several preparations of the recombinant proteins were
analysed, which gave very similar data for the enzymatic
activity. Expression of UGD1 could be obtained in E. coli
but results in an inactive enzyme (data not shown). Several
variations in E. coli culturing and protein puriﬁcation
conditions did not result in active recombinant UGD1
enzyme. Very recently Oka and Jigami (2006) published
the expression of recombinant Arabidopsis UGD1 in yeast.
Enzyme kinetics
The afﬁnity of the UGD isoforms for the cofactor NAD
+
does not differ between UGD2, 3, and 4. All enzymes
exhibit typical hyperbolic reaction kinetics, with a Km for
NAD
+ of ;40–45 lM (Table 2). The high afﬁnity of the
enzyme for NAD
+ suggests that UGDs are not limited by
the NAD
+ supply under physiological conditions.
In contrast to almost identical Km values for NAD
+,t h e
kinetic constants for UDP-Glc are highly dissimilar. UGD2
shows the highest afﬁnity (of the UGDs studied here) for
the substrate UDP-Glc, with a Km of 123 lM, followed
by UGD4 (171 lM) and UGD3 (335 lM) (Table 2). The
catalytic constant kcat was determined for the different iso-
forms with a value between 1.17 s
 1 (UGD4) and 2.52 s
 1
(UGD3) (see Table 2). Thus the different isoforms differ in
the turnover rate of UDP-GlcA formation.
In some bacteria the activity of UGDs is modulated by
phosphorylation on Tyr10, a conserved residue within the
NAD-binding site (Mijakovic et al., 2004). Recombinant
UGDs were incubated with alkaline phosphatase, which
can dephosphorylate the bacterial UGD (Mijakovic et al.,
3614 Klinghammer and Tenhaken2003, 2004), but no difference in the enzyme activity was
found.
Fine tuning of UGD activity was reported to be
mediated by feedback inhibition of the enzyme by UDP-
xylose, a product obtained from UDP-GlcA after
decarboxylation by the enzyme UDP-xylose synthase
(Neufeld and Hall, 1965; Hinterberg et al., 2002). The Ki
value for UDP-xylose was determined for each isoform in
the presence of different concentrations of UDP-Glc. The
inhibition is competitive to UDP-Glc and therefore is seen
mostly at low concentrations of UDP-Glc in the assays.
UGD2 is more sensitively inhibited by UDP-xylose

Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene family 3615(Ki ;83 lM) compared with UGD3 and 4, which exhibit
a Ki of ;160 lM and 220 lM, respectively (Fig. 6a–c).
The superfamily of nucleotide-sugar dehydrogenases is
quite conserved, and the substrate speciﬁcity cannot
readily be predicted by bioinformatic tools. Therefore,
different nucleotide-sugars were tested to determine if they
are accepted as substrates for UGDs from Arabidopsis
(Table 3). Unlike UDP, activated forms of glucose
(ADP-Glc and TDP-Glc) are not converted into the
corresponding NDP-GlcA derivatives, suggesting no di-
rect interference with the starch biosynthesis pathway. In
contrast to previous studies (Stewart and Copeland, 1998),
no evidence for a direct oxidation of UDP-galactose into
UDP-galacturonic acid was found. Products of the enzyme
assay were separated by HPLC (Fig. 7). A time-dependent
increase of the product UDP-GlcA was observed, directly
correlating to the increase in NADH in the spectophoto-
metric assay. The product analysis for the substrate speci-
ﬁcity assays is shown in Fig. 7 using recombinant UGD1.
This isoform has the highest number of amino acid changes
from the UGD consensus sequences (compare Fig. 1) and
was thus considered to be the most likely candidate for a
nucleotide-sugar dehydrogenase accepting substrates other
than UDP-Glc. None of the four UGDs from Arabidopsis
accepted UDP-galactose as a substrate (Fig. 7). In bacteria,
members of the NDP-sugar dehydrogenase family use
nucleotide-sugars such as GDP-mannose, UDP-galactose,
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine
as substrates. None of these potential substrates is accepted
by the Arabidopsis UGDs. In summary, the data indicate
that Arabidopsis has only true UGDs which accept UDP-
Glc as their only substrate. The UGDs clearly prefer NAD
+
as a cofactor. Exchanging NAD
+ for NADP
+ greatly re-
duces the enzyme activity to ;20% (Table 3).

(Zablackis et al., 1995). Therefore, biochemical pathways
for the formation of UDP-GlcA are of great importance
for the supply of glycosyl donors for polymer synthases
and glycosyl transferases in the Golgi apparatus. As the
nucleotide-sugars derived from UDP-GlcA are almost ex-
clusively used for the synthesis of cell wall material, the
entry point of nucleotide-sugars into a pool for cell wall
synthesis is tightly controlled. Previous studies have shown
a close correlation between UGD transcripts and enzyme
activity in Arabidopsis (Seitz et al., 2000). Furthermore,
Gahan et al. (1997) and Johansson et al. (2002) have

Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene family 3617regarded UGD as a marker enzyme for developing xylem
cells from cambium meristems in trees, because of a tight
correlation between cell division, growth, and UGD
enzyme activity. These studies have been extended by
analysing the whole gene family of UGD genes from
Arabidopsis. The available sequence data from the genome
project as well as the sequenced EST libraries suggest
four highly similar members of the UGD gene family in
Arabidopsis (UGD1–4) in addition to a pseudogene (partial
sequence). In the rice genome, at least ﬁve sequences for
putative UGD genes can be identiﬁed (compare the tree in
Fig. 1C). The presence of isoforms for UGDs was ignored
in previous studies (Tenhaken and Thulke, 1996; Stewart
and Copeland, 1998; Seitz et al., 2000; Turner and Botha,
2002). The main reason seems to be highly conserved
amino acid sequences, which result in proteins with similar
chromatographic properties.
Nucleotide-sugar dehydrogenases represent a large fam-
ily of quite well conserved proteins, which oxidize the
primary alcohol group at C6 of various sugars into the
corresponding uronic acid (Roychoudhury et al., 1989).
In bacteria, diverse substrates are converted by different
family members. Based on multiple protein sequence align-
ments, it is likely that some of the annotations regarding the
substrates are falsely assigned (data not shown). The
PFAM database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/)
for patterns in proteins annotated the UGD-like genes from
Arabidopsis and rice, and also plant EST sequences
as ‘UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase family’
(PF03721). This suggests that the substrate speciﬁcity of
enzymes from this family cannot be predicted accurately
by bioinformatics but needs experimental support. By
expressing the proteins UGD1, 2, 3, and 4 as recombinant
proteins, it has been shown here that they are true UGDs.
In the light of the separate nucleotide-sugar pools for
cell wall synthesis and for sucrose synthesis, it is im-
portant to know whether UDP-Glc is the only entry point
of nucleotide-sugars into the cell wall pool. Previously
Stewart and Copeland (1998) reported that one of the
soybean UGDs also accepts UDP-galactose as a substrate,
suggesting that the pectin precursor UDP-galacturonic
acid may be directly derived from UDP-galactose. This
possibility is excluded for the Arabidopsis UGDs based
on the enzyme activity measurements with different
potential substrates, which clearly indicate UDP-Glc as
the only convertible substrate. As the measurement for
UDP-Glc dehydrogenase activity in the study of Stewart
and Copeland (1998) was based on an increase of NADH
in the assay without analysis of the product, it seems
possible either that the substrate UDP-galactose contained
some residual UDP-Glc or that the enzyme preparation was
contaminated with residual UDP-glucose-4-epimerase,
which could have converted part of the UDP-galactose into
UDP-Glc. The recent cloning of the genes encoding UDP-
GlcA-4-epimerase (Mølhøj et al., 2004; Usadel et al.,
2004), which produces UDP-galacturonic acid as glycosyl
donor for pectic polymers, further supports this con-
clusion. Stewart and Copeland (1998) have puriﬁed
a UDP-Glc dehydrogenase from soybean nodules, but the
presence of isoforms was not considered. To our knowl-
edge, only a single UGD from soybean has been char-
acterized biochemically in more detail (Hinterberg et al.,
2002), but evidence for the conversion of UDP-galactose
was also not found in this study.
The biochemical data for the UGD isoforms from
Arabidopsis showing a graded afﬁnity for UDP-Glc and
substrate turnover numbers suggest a role in the regulation
of carbon ﬂuxes into nucleotide-sugar pools for cell walls.
During most of the life cycle of Arabidopsis, UGD2, 3,
and 4 are co-expressed in the same tissues and thus
different afﬁnities for UDP-Glc and substrate turnover
numbers might limit the use of too much UDP-Glc for cell
wall polymers. In contrast, UGD1 has a high afﬁnity for
UDP-Glc (Oka and Jigami, 2006) but is expressed at low
levels. Seitz et al. (2000) demonstrated a histochemical
UGD activity stain in whole seedlings, which shows only

3618 Klinghammer and Tenhakena minor UGD activity in the hypocotyl compared with the
primary root. In these seedlings, UGD1 is the major
expressed isoform (compare Fig. 3). Kinetic constants for
UGDs from different organisms vary over a wide range.
One of the soybean UGDs, which has previously been
characterized, has a high afﬁnity for UDP-Glc (Km
;21 lM; Hinterberg et al. 2002) similar to a UGD from
sugarcane (Km ;19 lM; Turner and Botha, 2002),
whereas UGDs from maize (Km¼380 lM and 950 lM)
show much higher Km values (Ka ¨rko ¨nen et al. 2005). The
Arabidopsis UGDs have an intermediate Km for UDP-Glc,
ranging from 123 lM to 335 lM. Oka and Jigami (2006)
determined a high afﬁnity Km (15.3 lM) for UDP-Glc for
UGD1 from Arabidopsis. The high afﬁnity of UGDs for
UDP-Glc is correlated with a strong feedback inhibition by
UDP-xylose (;10 lMi ns o y b e a n ;1 7lM in sugarcane)
but with much higher Ki values for the Arabidopsis UGD2,
3, and 4 (Ki 80–220 lM) as indicated in Table 2.
Interestingly, Oka and Jigami (2006) determined the Ki of
UDP-xylose for UGD1 to be 4.9 lM. This particular
isoform also has a high afﬁnity for the substrate UDP-Glc
(15.3 lM), suggesting a structural modiﬁcation of the
enzyme substrate-binding pocket which increases the
afﬁnity for both the substrate UDP-Glc and the inhibitor
UDP-Xyl. The kcat values indicate a similar substrate
conversion rate by the different isoforms, ranging from
1.17 s
 1 for the slowest enzyme UGD4 to 2.52 s
 1 for the
fastest enzyme UGD3, and intermediate values for UGD2.
These turnover rates agree well with data for the UGD
from S. pyogenes (kcat¼1.8 s
 1)( G eet al., 2004) and the
enzyme puriﬁed from bovine liver (kcat¼ 2.92 s
 1;c a l c u -
lated on the basis of 50 kDa per subunit) (Zalitis and
Feingold, 1969). In contrast, Bar-Peled et al. (2004) re-
ported a much lower value for the UGD from Cryptococcus
neoformans (kcat¼0.27 s
 1). The 2-fold difference in the
turnover number between the Arabidopsis isoforms may
well be important. UGD3 has the lowest afﬁnity for UDP-
Glc but the highest turnover number, indicating that the
ﬂux of UDP-sugars into UDP-GlcA by UGD3 is signiﬁcant
under conditions of a non-limited supply of UDP-Glc.
Though the exact concentration of UDP-Glc in Arabidopsis
leaves is not known and probably depends on environmen-
tal conditions as well, it can be assumed to be in the range
of 1 mM. Dancer et al. (1990) estimated 3–4 mM UDP-
Glc for spinach leaves. Farre ´ et al. (2001) calculated
0.83 mM for the UDP-Glc concentration in potato tubers.
The main competitor enzyme of UGDs for the substrate
UDP-Glc is SPS, utilizing UDP-Glc for the biosynthesis of
sucrose. The Km values of SPSs for UDP-Glc are usually
slightly higher than the Km of UGDs reported here
(Avigad, 1982). In addition, cellulose is synthesized from
UDP-Glc or sucrose cleaved via membrane-bound iso-
forms of sucrose synthase into UDP-Glc and fructose. For
example, cotton antisense plants for sucrose synthase have
impaired cellulose trichomes, indicating an essential role
for sucrose synthase in providing UDP-Glc for cellulose
biosynthesis (Ruan et al., 2003). The same mechanism
may also apply to other b-glucan synthases (Buckeridge
et al., 1999; Konishi et al., 2004). These ﬁndings suggest
a supply of UDP-Glc from sucrose for various b-glucan
synthases, which is presumably independent of the soluble
UDP-Glc pool. Whether UGD uses UDP-Glc from
cleaved sucrose to a larger extent is not known. However,
strong evidence for this use is lacking, as indicated by the
analysis of single and double knockout mutants in sucrose
synthase, which show no cell wall mutant phenotypes
(Bieniawska et al., 2007). The ﬂux of UDP-Glc into either
sucrose or UDP-GlcA (for cell wall hemicelluloses) will
therefore depend on several factors including the Km for
UDP-Glc of the enzymes, enzyme substrate turnover
numbers, amount of enzyme, and post-translational

Arabidopsis UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene family 3619regulation of activity. In a recent paper by Park et al.
(2007) the authors report on transgenic tobacco plants
overexpressing an SPS gene, which have a reduced
amount of arabinose and xylose in their cell wall. This
indicates that the ﬂux of UDP-Glc into hemicellulose
material via UGD was displaced by favouring sucrose
formation. Taking the data from reporter gene expression,
real-time PCR, and knockout mutants (R Reboul, M
Klinghammer, T Tenhaken, unpublished data), into ac-
count, it is concluded that UGD2 and UGD3 are the major
contributing enzymes for the ﬂux from UDP-Glc into
UDP-GlcA in Arabidopsis.
