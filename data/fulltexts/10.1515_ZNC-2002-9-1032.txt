Diosgenone, Crystal Structure, Antimalarial Activity
The molecular structure of diosgenone, a natural ste­
roidal sapogenin, closely related to diosgenin and iso­
lated from Solanuni nudum, was solved by single crystal 
X-ray diffractometry at 120 K and refined by full-matrix 
least-squares to an agreement factor, R1 = 0.054. It crys­
tallizes in the monoclinic space group P2lt with a = 
15.1870(4) Á, b = 7.2710(2) Á, c = 21.2840(6) Á, [3 = 
99.251(1) °, and four molecules in the unit cell (Z = 4). 
The results constitute the first structural report on a ste­
roidal sapogenin from the diosgenin group.
Introduction
Solarium nudum (Solanaceae), a shrub growing 
in different regions of South America, is used in 
the Pacific area of Colombia, under the names za- 
pata or zapatico, for treatment of fevers associated 
with malaria. Its activity was confirmed by in vitro 
screening of ethanol extracts of the plant that 
showed promising antimalarial potency (Saez 
etal., 1998). Some years ago, a steroidal alkaloid, 
solanudine, was found in the fruits of this plant 
(Usubillaga, 1988) and, recently, a number of ste­
roids have been isolated from methanolic extracts 
of its aerial parts (Saez et al., 1998).
Diosgenone, the major component of these ex­
tracts, was now isolated for the first time in a pure 
form from a natural source although it has been 
known ever since Marker et al. (1940) obtained it 
by oxidation of diosgenin and reported some of 
its properties and reactions. It is closely related to 
diosgenin and to tigogenin (Fieser and Fieser, 
1949), steroids that have been used as starting 
points for the synthesis of sex hormones. In the 
present communication we report the crystal 
structure of this interesting natural product, which 
so far was only investigated by spectroscopic 
methods. The present study constitutes also the 
first structural report on a steroidal sapogenin 
from the diosgenin group.
Crystal data, collection procedures and refine­
ment results are summarized in Table I. All hy­
drogen atoms but one of a methyl group were 
found among the first 90 peaks of a difference 
Fourier map. However, they were positioned on a 
stereochemical basis and refined with the riding 
model. The methyl H-atoms were treated in the 
refinement as rigid bodies and allowed to rotate 
around the corresponding C-C bond, such as to 
maximize the sum of the observed electron density 
at the three calculated H-positions. As expected, 
these refined positions converged to staggered 
methyl configurations.
Figure 1 is an ORTEP drawing (Johnson, 1976) 
showing one of the molecules present in the asym­
metric unit cell. A set of selected bond distances 
and angles is given in Table II. There are two mole­
cules per asymmetric unit with a quite similar con­
formation. The root mean squares deviation be­
tween homologous atoms for the best least-squares 
superposition of the two molecules performed by 
the algorithm of Kabsch (1976), is 0.256 A.
As it can be seen the compound has the skeleton 
which is typical of steroid sapogenins (Fieser and 
Fieser, 1949). Because of the negligible small 
atomic anomalous dispersion for the radiation em­
ployed in our experiments (the molybdenum Ka- 
line), a reliable crystallographic determination of 
the absolute molecular configuration was not pos­
sible. But, the right-handed R chirality is sup­
ported by the presence of the cyclopentanephen­
anthrene molecular fragment with the same stereo 
conformation reported for two related natural 
products, namely guggulsterol-1 (Bajaj et al., 1981) 
and 16|3-methylprogesterone (Weeks et al., 1976).

The short C(14)-C(15) bond distance of 
1.345(4) A clearly confirms the location of a 
double bond between these two carbon atoms. The 
double C = O bond, at the C(13) carbon, is of 
1.230(3) A, whereas the other C-O bonds, involv­
ing the 0(11) and 0(12) oxygen atoms, ranged be­
tween 1.428(3) and 1.447(3) A. The 0(12)- 
C(122)-O(ll) angle (109.8(2)°) is practically at 
the expected tetrahedral value.
All C-C bond distances not included explicitly 
in Table II ranged between 1.516 and 1.565 A, 
whereas the values for the C-C-C angles not in­
cluded in the Table are between 107.7 and 115.8 °.
Experimental
Isolation of diosgenone
Solatium nudum was collected in the coastal area 
of the department of Nariho, Colombia. A voucher 
sample is stored under registration number 554 in 
the Herbarium of the University of Antioquia 
(Medellin). Diosgenone was extracted from the 
stems and leaves of the plant as previously de­
scribed (Saez et al., 1998). In order to obtain single 
crystals adequate for a structural analysis, the pro­
duct was dissolved in absolute ethanol and main­
tained at room temperature. After a few weeks, 
crystal deposition was observed.
Crystallographic study
Intensity data were collected with a colorless 
crystal fragment of dimensions 0.28 x 0.24 x 
0.18 mm, at 120 (2) K, using a Kappa CCD diffrac-

tometer provided with a low-temperature device 
(Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford/England) and using 
graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (X = 
0.71070 A). The data were corrected for Lorentz 
and polarization effects. Absorption correction 
was not applied as the linear absorption coefficient 
(p) is very low. The unit cell dimensions were ob­
tained by least-squares refinement of the angular 
settings for 4390 reflections in the 1.00 < 0 < 
26.02 ° range and the structure was solved by di­
rect and Fourier methods. The final molecular 
model was obtained by anisotropic full-matrix 
least-squares refinement of non-hydrogen atoms. 
Programs used were DENZO and SCALEPACK 
(Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) for data reduction 
and correction, and SHELXS-97 and SHELXL- 
97 (Sheldrick, 1997a,b) for structure solution and 
refinement, respectively.
Supplementary crystallographic data
Atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic 
displacement parameters, full bond distances and 
angles for the two molecules in the asymmetric 
unit cell, anisotropic displacement parameters and 
hydrogen coordinates and isotropic displacement 
parameters can be obtained from the authors and 
have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystal­
lographic Centre under the deposition number 
CCDC 187489.
