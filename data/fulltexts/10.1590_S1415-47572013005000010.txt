Abstract
Cancer has become a major public health problem worldwide and the number of deaths due to this disease is in-
creasing almost exponentially. In the constant search for new treatments, natural products of plant origin have pro-
vided a variety of new compounds to be explored as antitumor agents. Tabernaemontana catharinensis is a
medicinal plant that produces alkaloids with expressive antitumor activity, such as heyneanine, coronaridine and
voacangine. The aim of present study was firstly to screen the cytotoxic activity of the indole alkaloids heyneanine,
coronaridine and voacangine against HeLa (human cervix tumor), 3T3 (normal mouse embryo fibroblasts), Hep-2
(human laryngeal epithelial carcinoma) and B-16 (murine skin) cell lines by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide); and secondly to analyze the apoptotic activity, cell membrane damage and
genotoxicity of the compound that showed the best cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested. Coronaridine
was the one that exhibited greater cytotoxic activity in the laryngeal carcinoma cell line Hep-2 (IC50 = 54.47 g/mL)
than the other alkaloids tested (voacangine IC50 = 159.33 g/mL, and heyneanine IC50 = 689.45 g/mL). Coronaridine
induced apoptosis in cell lines 3T3 and Hep-2, even at high concentrations. The evaluation of genotoxicity by comet
assay showed further that coronaridine caused minimal DNA damage in the Hep-2 tumor cell line, and the LDH test
showed that it did not affect the plasma membrane. These results suggest that further investigation of coronaridine
as an antitumor agent has merit.

Introduction
Although the advances in oncology have led to more
effective treatments and cure, cancer continues to be one of
the leading causes of human death (Jemal et al., 2011). La-
ryngeal cancer accounts for about 2.7% of all cancers and
for 2.1% of all deaths due to cancer. According to the Bra-
zilian National Institute of Cancer, in the State of São Paulo
the number of cases of laryngeal cancer per 100,000 inhab-
itants estimated for 2012 will be 6.9-10.68 for men and
3.91-7.54 for women. Laryngeal cancer is one of the fre-
quent head and neck cancers, accounting for approximately
25% of all malignant head and neck tumors. A major diffi-
culty in preventing cancer progression is the increased re-
sistance, low specificity and high toxicity of drugs that are
commercially available (Riedl et al., 2011). The toxicity of
chemotherapeutic agents is a decisive treatment factor, par-
ticularly in immunocompromised patients (Geard, 1992).
The development of new cytotoxic compounds is therefore
important, and evaluation of the genotoxic activity of the
compounds in non-tumor cells is also necessary, to assure
that the treatment is safe and has no serious side effects.
Fucic et al. (1998) reported that few chemotherapeutic
agents induce secondary tumors in patients with cancer.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential pro-
cess for the maintenance of the development of a living or-
ganism, by eliminating superfluous or defective cells. In
addition to playing an important role in the control of vari-
ous vital processes, apoptosis forms the basis of various
cancer treatment strategies, in which apoptosis is induced
in tumor cells in response to treatment with cytotoxic
agents (Grivicich et al., 2007; Sayers, 2011). Necrosis is a

type of cell death in which cells suffer damage that results
in an increase of cell volume, chromatin aggregation, cyto-
plasm disorganization, loss of plasma membrane integrity
and consequent cell rupture. The cell content is released,
causing damage to neighboring cells and an inflammatory
reaction at the site of injury (Kelekar, 2005).
Natural products are a rich source of new drugs, and a
large number of substances with cytotoxic activity have
been isolated from plants (Araujo and Leon, 2001; Lachen-
meier et al., 2006; Castaneda et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011).
For instance, Vincristine (Oncovin®), an alkaloid found in
species of the family Apocynaceae, is used as an antitumor
agent in oncology. Like other secondary metabolites found
in nature that are the active ingredients of anticancer drugs,
such as paclitaxel, apoptolodin and bryostatin, vincristine
blocks mitotic progression, causing metaphase arrest (Tsu-
kamoto et al., 2011).
Tabernaemontana catharinensis A.DC, a plant of the
family Apocynaceae, popularly known as ”leiteiro de vaca”
(cow’s dogbane), found in Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and
Bolivia, is used by the population as anticancer remedy.
The genus Tabernaemontana is rich in monoterpene indole
alkaloids such as coronaridine, voacangine, hydroxycoro-
naridine, isovoacangine, 11-hydroxycoronaridine, voacris-
tine, 19-epi-voacristine, isovoacristine, ibogamine,
10-metoxyibogamine, 11-metoxyibogamine, and 19-epi-
heyneanine (Kam and Sim, 2002; Prakash Chaturvedula et
al., 2003). These indole alkaloids have numerous biologi-
cal activities, including central nervous system-stimulating
activity, antihypertensive, anticholinesterase, antimicrobial
and antimalarial properties, and especially antitumor activ-
ity (van Beek et al., 1984; Perera et al., 1985; Delorenzi et
al., 2001; Prakash Chaturvedula et al., 2003; de Almeida et
al., 2004; Kam et al., 2004; Andrade et al., 2005; Vieira et
al., 2008; Medeiros et al., 2011).
The present study investigated the cytotoxic activity
of the indole alkaloids heyneanine, coronaridine and voa-
cangine in different cell lines, using the MTT (3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
colorimetric assay. In view of the better cytotoxic activity
presented by coronaridine, we evaluated apoptosis induc-
tion, cell membrane damage and genotoxicity of this com-
pound in human laryngeal carcinoma (Hep-2) cells and in
normal mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T3).
Materials and Methods
Chemical agents
Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Cultilab
(Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil). Penicillin, streptomycin,
doxorubicin, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s and HAM-F10
culture media, DMSO, isopropanol, MTT, actinomycin D,
acridine orange, ethidium bromide and trypsin were pur-
chased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Plant material
Root barks of T. catharinensis were collected in As-
sis, São Paulo, Brazil, and a voucher specimen was depos-
ited at the herbarium (SPFR) of FFCLRP, University of São
Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil (Registration No. 02940).
Purification of alkaloids
The indole alkaloids coronaridine (COR), voacan-
gine (VOA) and heyneanine (HEY) (Figure 1) were puri-
fied from an ethanolic extract of T. catharinensis root bark,
as described by Pereira et al. (2008).
Cytotoxicity testing
Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmo-
sphere containing 5% CO2 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Sigma) for culture of the HeLa (human cervix tumor), 3T3
(normal mouse embryo fibroblasts) and Hep-2 (human la-
ryngeal epithelial carcinoma) cell lines. HAM-F10 medium
was used for culturing B-16 cells (murine skin). Penicillin
(100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 g/mL) were added to
the medium to prevent bacterial growth. A stock solution
(10 mg/mL) of each alkaloid was prepared in 10% DMSO.
Each alkaloid (COR, VOA and HEY) was directly diluted
in the medium, to obtain concentrations ranging from 15.62
to 1000 g/mL. The final concentration of DMSO was less
than 1% and had no negative effects on the cell lines.
Doxorubicin and actinomycin D (8 g/mL) were used as
positive controls. Cells were trypsinized (0.15% trypsin
and 0.02% EDTA), counted in a hemocytometer (105
cells/well), and incubated in a 96-well plate for 24 h. After
addition of the alkaloid or vehicle dissolved in fresh me-
dium, the cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmo-
sphere for 48 h, and cytotoxicity was analyzed by the MTT
assay (Mosmann, 1983). For this purpose, 20 L MTT/well
(5 mg/mL in Hanks solution) were added to the 96-well
plate, and the assay was incubated for 4 h under the same
conditions. All cell treatments were carried out in triplicate.
The formazan dye formed was extracted with 200 L iso-
propanol and quantified spectrophotometrically at 550 nm
in a thermo plate reader (Biotek ELx 800, Singapura). The
absorbance of untreated cells was used as a reference. The

alkaloid found to be the most effective against the three tu-
mor cell lines in the MTT assay was used in the next experi-
ments (apoptosis, comet assay and lactate dehydrogenase
activity measurement).
Detection of apoptosis
Apoptosis was analyzed as described by Ribble et al.
(2005). Briefly, 2.0 x 105 cells were treated with COR for
48 h, harvested by trypsinization, and centrifuged at
2500 rpm (129 g) for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in
150 L acridine orange and ethidium bromide (100 g/mL
each), and 20 L of the cell suspension was analyzed under
a fluorescence microscope. The number of viable, apop-
totic and necrotic cells was counted in 300 cells per treat-
ment.
Comet assay
Hep-2 and 3T3 (2 x 104 cells/mL) cells were incu-
bated with 15.62, 31.25, 62.5 and 125 g/mL COR for 6 h
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The alkaline comet assay
was performed as described by McKelvey-Martin et al.
(1993). Tice et al. (2000), and Liao et al. (2009), with mi-
nor modifications (Hartmann and Speit, 1997). Randomly
selected cells (300 cells from each of three replicate slides,
total = 900 cells) were analyzed per COR concentration.
Cells were visually scored regarding damage, divided into
five classes, and the DNA damage index was calculated as
described by Collins et al. (1995) and da Silva et al. (2000).
Doxorubicin (0.2 g/mL) was used as positive control and
1% DMSO as solvent control.
Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase
3T3 and Hep2 cells were incubated in 96-well plates
(2.5 x 105 cells/well) containing the adequate culture me-
dium for each cell line in the presence of 15.62, 31.25, 62.5,
and 125 g/mL of COR, respectively, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere, in triplicate. Then, 20 L cell-free culture
supernatant were collected from each well and incubated
with the appropriate reagent mixture, according to manu-
facturer instructions (Extracellular Lactate Dehydrogenase
LDHe test from Xenometrix, Allschwil, Switzerland) at
room temperature for 60 min. The plates were read at
340 nm in a microplate reader (Biotek ELx 800, Singapore)
at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 min, respectively. The
percentage of LDH released from treated cells into the cul-
ture was calculated by comparison with the maximal
amount released by cells lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (posi-
tive control), according to the method described by
Kornberg (1955).
Data analysis
The cytotoxicity results were analyzed by ANOVA
(two paired samples for average) adopting a significance
level of p < 0.05. IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear re-
gression analysis. The comet assay, apoptosis and LDH test
results are shown as mean  standard deviation, and were an-
alyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test.
Results
Cytotoxic activity of indole alkaloids
The MTT colorimetric assay was used to evaluate the
cytotoxicity of the three alkaloids isolated from T.
catharinensis in different tumor cell lines (Table 1). The
highest cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 54.47 g/mL) was pre-
sented by coronaridine in the Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma
cell line as compared to the other alkaloids tested (voa-
cangine: 159.33 g/mL, and heyneanine: 694.45 g/mL).
The IC50 values of the positive controls were 1.57 and
0.81 g/mL for doxorubicin and actinomycin D, respec-
tively. The pure alkaloids (coronaridine, voacangine and
heyneanine) also exhibited cytotoxic activity against nor-
mal 3T3 cells, with IC50 values of 89.28, 104.16 and
289.15 g/mL, respectively, indicating that these alkaloids
are not specific for tumor cells.
Detection of apoptosis
Coronaridine induced apoptosis in 3T3 (Figure 2A)
and Hep-2 (Figure 2B) cells at all concentrations tested,
even at the highest concentration of 125 g/mL. In contrast,
doxorubicin more frequently induced cell necrosis rather
than apoptosis.
Comet assay
The results of the comet assay showed that incubation
of cells with coronaridine for 6 h induced DNA damage

only in the Hep-2 tumor cell line, at all concentrations
tested (including the highest concentration) when com-
pared to the negative control. Doxorubicin produced a
higher DNA damage index in normal 3T3 cells than the
highest concentration of coronaridine (125 g/mL). At the
concentrations of 62.5 and 125 g/mL, coronaridine in-
duced greater DNA damage in the Hep-2 cell line than in
the normal 3T3 cells. Compared to the commercially avail-
able chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, which presented
a DNA damage index of 500 at the concentration of
0.2 g/mL, the genotoxocity of coronaridine was low (Fig-
ure 3).
Lactate dehydrogenase activity
The LDH measurements showed that, at the concen-
trations tested, coronaridine did not increase LDH activity
in either the Hep-2 tumor cells or the normal 3T3 cells
(data not shown). These results suggest that this alkaloid
does not cause damage to the cell membrane the cell lines
tested.
Discussion
Of the indole alkaloids tested (coronaridine, voa-
cangine and heyneanine), coronaridine showed the best
cytotoxic activity against the human laryngeal carcinoma
cell line Hep-2. We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of pure
coronaridine, voacangine and heyneanine because of their
structural similarity, since they all contain an indole group
that characterizes their function. Coronaridine is character-
ized by the presence of a functional ether group in the aro-
matic ring, whereas voacangine and heyneanine present no
substitution in the aromatic ring. The presence of this ether
group in the aromatic ring may explain the greater cyto-
toxic activity of coronaridine against Hep-2 cells (Figuei-
redo et al., 2010). Coronaridine was also cytotoxic to the
normal 3T3 cell line, demonstrating that this activity is not
specific for tumor cells. This feature is often reported for
current chemotherapeutic agents. The most commonly
used anticancer drugs simply kill tumor cells, but also dam-
age or kill neighboring healthy cells (Mancebo et al., 2002).
Indole alkaloids purified from other
Tabernaemontana species presented cytotoxic activity
against both vincristine-sensitive (KB/S) and -resistant
(KB/VJ300) epidermoid carcinoma cell lines (van Beek et
al., 1984; Kam et al., 2004). These authors obtained IC50
values of 11.5 and 2.6 g/mL for coronaridine, > 25 and
8.56 g/mL for heyneanine, > 25 and > 25 g/mL for
voacangine, and > 25 and > 25 g/mL for ibogamine in the
KB/S and KB/VJ300 lines, respectively. These results de-
monstrate that coronaridine and heyneanine reversed the
process of multiple drug resistance in the vincristine-resis-
tant cell line. Bradacs et al. (2010) evaluated the cytotoxic
activity of a methanol extract of Tabernaemontana
pandacaqui. This extract exhibited potent activity against
renal cancer cells (786-0), with an IC50 value of
4.62 g/mL. The ethyl acetate extract of this species re-
duced the viability of lung cancer cells (IC50 of
13.46 g/mL). The present study showed that purified
coronaridine from T. catharinensis has a moderate cyto-
toxic activity against the larynx carcinoma cell line tested,
with an IC50 value higher than that obtained for T.
pandacaqui tested in renal cancer cells. This finding might
be due to differences between the types of cell lines used in
the cytotoxicity assay. Although coronaridine exhibited a

moderate cytotoxic activity, analysis of its mechanism of
action showed that it induced apoptosis, did not cause dam-
age to the cell membrane (as demonstrated by the LDH
test), and caused minimal DNA damage (as determined by
the comet assay). The commercial chemotherapeutic agent
doxorubicin induced necrosis in the Hep-2 tumor cell line
and even more so in normal 3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore,
doxorubicin caused greater DNA damage in normal than in
tumor cells when compared to coronaridine. Carvalho et al.
(2010) compared the effect of the anthracycline cosmo-
mycin D and doxorubicin in DNA repair-deficient cell lines
(XP-A and XP-C). Treatment of XP-A and XP-C cells with
cosmomycin D induced apoptosis in a time-dependent
manner. The highest degree of apoptosis was observed after
96 h of treatment and the effects of this drug were similar to
those of doxorubicin. Cosmomycin D was also found to
cause DNA damage in the comet assay, however a mark-
edly lower one than that caused by doxorubicin.
Figueiredo et al. (2010) tested the alkaloids coro-
naridine, (19S)-heyneanine, isovoacangine, isovoacristine
and voacangine isolated from Tabernaemontana
salzmannii and observed satisfactory cytotoxic activity
against human leukemia cells (THP-1). Cell death due to
apoptosis was detected in 100% of cells. Voacangine in-
duced apoptosis in 80% of cells treated with 100 mol of
the compound within a period of 24 h, whereas isovoa-
cangine induced apoptosis in 80% of cells within a period
of 6 h when tested at a concentration of 100 mol. No
acridine-orange-stained cells were observed at any of the
time points studied, suggesting that the alkaloids tested did
not induce cell death by necrosis. Induction of apoptosis is
the mechanism of action of various antineoplastic drugs,
such as Taxol and cisplatin. The ability to induce apoptosis
is therefore used as a screening tool for substances with
antitumor activity (Kam and Sim, 2002). In this respect,
monoterpene indole alkaloids isolated from the methanol
extract of Tabernaemontana elegans leaves has been
shown to induce apoptosis in human hepatoma cells
(HuH-7) (Mansoor et al., 2009).
In conclusion, of the indole alkaloids tested (hey-
neanine, coronaridine and voacangine), coronaridine ex-
hibited the greatest cytotoxic activity in the larynx carci-
noma cell line used. When screening natural products for
cytotoxicity, their genotoxic activity must be be taken into
consideration, to prevent secondary tumors after treatment.
Although coronaridine has a moderate cytotoxic activity, it
presents advantages due to its mechanism of action. This al-
kaloid induced apoptosis in Hep cells even at high concen-
trations, caused minimal DNA damage only in the tumor
cell line, and did not affect the cell plasma membrane.
