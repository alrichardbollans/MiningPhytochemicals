Abstract
Investigation of the aerial parts of the Egyptian medicinal plant Ammi majus L. led to isolation of new coumarin, 6-
hydroxy-7-methoxy-4 methyl coumarin (2) and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxy coumarin (3); this is the first time they have
been isolated from this plant. The structures of the compounds (2 &3) were elucidated by spectroscopic data
interpretation and showed anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activity.
Graphical abstract: An efficient, one-new coumarin (2) was isolated from the aerial parts of the A. Majus L. was
evaluated for their anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities.
Keywords: phytochemistry, Ammi majus L., anti-viral activity, natural products, anti-inflammatory activity, steroids
1. Introduction
F r u c t u sA m m iM a j o r i sc o n s i s t so ft h ed r i e dr i p ef r u i t s
of Ammi majus L. (Apiaceae) [1,2]; originating Egypt,
and widely distributed in Europe, the Mediterranean
region, and western Asia, now cultivated in India [2].
This is widely used for the treatment of skin disorders
such as psoriasis and vitiligo (acquired leukoderma)
[1,3-6], and of vitiligo [1]. It is used as an emmenagogue
to regulate menstruation, as a diuretic, and for treat-
ment of leprosy, kidney stones, and urinary tract infec-
tions [7]. Numerous clinical trials have assessed the
efficacy of Fructus Ammi Majoris andxanthotoxin for
the treatment of vitiligo, psoriasis, and hypopigmenta-
tion tinea versicolor [4-6,8-11].
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Chemistry
The use of natural products in drug manufacturing is an
ancient and well-established practice [12]. Egyptian
medicinal plants are well known by their diverse uses in
traditional folk medicine to cure various ailments
including infectious diseases and known producers of
pharmacological and anti-viral agents [13]A. majus L.i s
contraindicated in diseases associated with photosensi-
tivity, cataract, invasive squamous-cell cancer, known
sensitivity to xanthotoxin (psoralens), and in children
under the age of 12 years [14]. The fruits are also con-
traindicated in pregnancy, nursing, tuberculosis, liver
and kidney diseases, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infections and other autoimmune diseases [15]. In
this study, the isolated compounds (2-4)f r o mA. majus
L. were evaluated for their anti-viral activity (Figure 1).
The major constituents are furanocoumarins, the princi-
pal compound beingxanthotoxin (methoxsalen, 8-meth-
oxypsorale [8-MOP]) ammoidin; up to, imperatorin
(ammid-in) and bergapten (heraclin, majudin, and 5-
methoxy Psoralen [5-MOP]) and other coumarins of sig-
nificance are marmesin (the structure of isolated com-
pounds) isoimperatorin, heraclenin, and isopimpinellin
constituents of interest are acetylated flavonoids [16-20].
The dried plant (500 g) of A. majus L. was sequentially
extracted with hexane and methanol. In our initial bio-
logical study as shown in Table 1 the compounds 2, 3
showed high anti-inflammatory activity while the com-
pound 4 showed moderate activity. This effect could
explain the medical use of A. majus in traditional medi-
cine. The hexane extract was chromatographed to give
b-sitosterol 1 [21]. The methanol fraction was chroma-
tographed on silica gel to give new coumarin 2 and two
coumarins 3, 4.C o m p o u n d2 showed fluorescence

compound in CDCl3 showed that no band was typical
of H-4 of a coumarin and singlet at δ 6.25 was assign-
able to H-3, indicating that methyl group was attached
at position 4. Another doublet was observed at δ 6.62,
which could be H-5 of a coumarin. There was a singlet
at δ 6.43 and 6.82 for two protons which represented

13C NMR spectrum
showed resonance for all 11 carbon atoms in the mole-
cule. The spectra revealed the presence of two methyl,
three methane and six quaternary carbon atoms. The
two downfield quaternary carbon signals at δ, 162.5 (C-
3) and 143.7 (C-6) showed the presence of ketonic and
one hydroxyl functionality in the molecule. The analyti-
cal results obtained from
13CN M Rs p e c t r u mf o rt h i s
compound was tabulated in Table 2. Compound 3
showed fluorescence under UV indicating it to be a cou-
marin. The IR spectrum of the compound exhibited the
presence of a carbonyl group at 1700 cm
-1 which was a
further support towards the coumarin nucleus. MS sug-
gested its molecular mass to be 192 which agreement
with formula C10H8O4.
1H NMR of the compound in
CDCl3 showed a doublet at δ 6.72 which was typical of
H-4 of a coumarin. Another doublet was observed at δ

results obtained from
13C NMR spectrum for this com-
pound were tabulated in Table 2. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, the coumarin compound 3 has not
previously been isolated from this family. The
1HN M R
data of furancoumarin system were closely similar to
compound 4, which included two doublets at δ 6.30 and
8.27 attributed to the pyran ring protons H-3 and H-4,
two other doublets at δ 7.19 and 7.80 corresponding to
the furan ring protons H-10 and H-9, and one olefinic
proton at δ 7.20 (s) for H-8. The data proposed com-
pound 4 to be xanthotoxin [16-20].
2.2. Biological studies
2.2.1. Anti-inflammatory activity
The pharmacological evaluation of the tested com-
pounds (2-4) was carried out as per the protocol speci-
fied. The anti-inflammatory activity of the synthesized
compounds was carried out using the carrageenan-
induced rat paw edema method. The anti-inflammatory
activity data for the compounds are given in Table 1. At
the dose level of 0.01 mg/100 g, (2, 3) exhibited appreci-
able inhibition of edema, especially 2, which exhibited a
87% of edema inhibition of 37.81%, which was compar-
able to that of the standard drug indomethacin (60.50%
at 0.01 mg/100 g dose) where the compound 4 exhibited
mild anti-inflammatory activity.
2.2.2. Anti-viral activity
The compounds (2-4) found to have antiviral activity,
[13] against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in a con-
centration-dependent manner at complete non-toxic
concentration range 10-100 μg/ml (Rf 10(5)), 10-100 μg/
ml (Rf 10(4)), and 50-100 μg/ml (Rf 10(3)), respectively.

nal standard using a 270-MHz JEOLJNM Ex-270/4000
NMR instrument. Optical rotations were determined on
a JASCO P-1020 polarimeter using a 100-mm glass
microcell. IR spectra (KBr) were recorded on a Perkin-
Elmer 1650 FT-IR spectrometer. The UV spectra were
recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2UV/VIS spec-
trophotometer. The melting points were determined
using a Digital Melting Point Apparatus (model IA
8103, Electro thermal Engineering Ltd, Soutthend-on-
Sea, Essex, UK). MS were measured on a GSMS-QP-
1000EX gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer SHI-
MADZU-Japan. For column chromatography, silica gel
(Merk. 63-200 μm particle size) was used. TLC was car-
ried out with Merk silica gel
60F254 Plates. UV light (245
and 366 mm) and spraying with vanillin-sulfuric acid
reagent followed by heating (120 C) were used for
detection.
3.2. Plant material
The aerial parts of the A. Majus L. were obtained from
local market, Egypt, in March 2010. The plant material
has been deposited at the Laboratory of Botany, Faculty
of Science, and Zagazig University, Egypt.
3.3. Extraction and isolation
The air-dried plant (500 g) was powdered and
extracted with hexane (1.6 l) at room temperature (25°
C) for 30 min, and the hexane solution was evaporated
in vacuo to give a residue (21 g). The methanol extract
(32 g) was obtained by the same procedure. The hex-
ane (20 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (200 g)
using hexane with increasing amounts of ethyl acetate
(5:1) to b-sitosterol (1 C29H50O). It is crystallized from
methanol (20 mg; from Hexane-EtOAc 9:1, Rf =0 . 2 2

3.7. Biological studies
3.7.1. Anti-inflammatory activity
The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by hind
paw oedema method [23]. Albino rats of weighing 100-
150 g, of either three compounds (2-4),u s i n gI n d o -
methacin as a standard, were divided into five groups of
six animals. The animals were maintained under normal
environmental conditions. To each group, with the
exception of the control group, the tested compounds
(0.01 mg/100 g of body weight) were administered,
injected. To one group, the standard drug Indomethacin
(0.01 mg/100 g) was administered. After 1 h, carragee-
nan (0.1 ml, 1% w/v solution in sterile saline) was
injected into the sub-plantar tissue of the left paw of all
the animals. The right paw served as the reference non-
inflamed paw for comparison. The initial paw volume
was measured using a plethysmograph within 30 s of
the injection. After 3 h, the final paw volume of each
animal was measured. The percentage of reduction in
the paw volume was calculated by subtracting the differ-
ence between the right and left hind paw volumes in the
treated group from the difference in the control group
and dividing it by the difference in the control group.
The anti-inflammatory tivity of the tested compounds
and the standard reference drug was determined using
the formula, % anti-inflammatory activity = (1 - Vt/Vc)

Page 3 of 4× 100, where Vt represented the mean increase in paw
volume of rats treated with test compounds and Vc
represented the mean increase in paw volume in the
control group of rats.
3.7.2. Anti-viral activity
In this study, the compounds (2-4) were evaluated for
their anti-viral activity. These compounds were tested
against two mammalian viruses, HSV-1 and VSV. The
antiviral activity were determined by means of the end
titration technique that depends on the ability of plant
extract dilutions to inhibit the produced cytopathogenic
effect and expressed as reduction factor (Rf)o ft h ev i r a l
titer.
4. Conclusion
Ammi majus L. being local medicinal plants with great
abundance in west of Egypt are shown in rich in anti-
viral and anti-inflammatory activities, including phyto-
chemicals coumarin.{} These results give them the privi-
lege to start intensive studies for isolation of these
biologically active compounds for local drug-design pro-
grams. In addition, A. majus L. is considered as a good
source of 6-hydroxy-7-methoxy coumarin (3) which was
identified as the major coumarin. Also, this is the first
study to report the occurrence of compound (3).
