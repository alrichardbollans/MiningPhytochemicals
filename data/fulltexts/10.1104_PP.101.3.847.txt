Changes in the Levels of Phenylpropanoid Pathway lntermediates in Relation to Regulation of i-Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase in Elicitor-Treated Cell-Suspension Cultures John D. Orr, Robert Edwards', and Richard A. Dixon* Plant Biology Division, The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Ardmore, Oklahoma 73402 We have used high-resolution gas chromatography to determine the levels of trans-cinnamic acid (CA) and trans-4-coumaric acid (4CA) in alfalfa (Medicago sativa 1.) cell-suspension cultures to address the role of these phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates as potential negative regulators of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in vivo. Exogenous addition of CA to elicitor-treated cultures resulted in rapid increases in endogenous CA, 4CA, and CA- conjugate levels associated with inhibition of the appearance of PAL transcripts. Treatment of elicited cultures with a-aminooxy-8- phenylpropionic acid (AOPP), a potent and specific inhibitor of PAL activity in vivo, resulted in reductions of CA and 4CA, with concomitant increases in PAL transcripts and extradable enzyme activity. In contrast, treatment with tetcyclacis, an inhibitor of CA 4-hydroxylase, resulted in increased CA and CA-conjugate levels, decreased 4CA levels, and decreased PAL transcript levels and enzyme adivity. In tetcyclasis-treated cells, the inhibition of PAL transcript appearance preceded the increase in the levels of free CA and i ts  conjugates. In elicited cells in which the phenylpropa- noid pathway was not perturbed by metabolic inhibitors, PAL transcripts accumulated rapidly and transiently, beginning to de- cline by 2 h postelicitation. Changes in levels of total free or conjugated CA or 4CA did not consistently correlate with these changes in transcript levels. We propose that regulation of PAL transcript levels by endogenous phenylpropanoid pathway inter- mediates could involve compartmentalized pools that may exist because of the microsomal localization of cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase. Leguminous plants respond to infection by funga1 patho- gens, or elicitor molecules from the cell walls of these path- ogens, by synthesizing antimicrobial phytoalexins and wall- bound phenolics derived from L-Phe (Fig. 1). PAL catalyzes the first committed step in thebiosynthesis of thesedefense- related phenylpropanoids, the conversion of Phe into CA. CHS catalyzes the conversion of 4-coumaroyl Co-A into 2',4,4'-trihydroxychalcone, the first branch point into the production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids. The phytoalexin defense response involves the rapid transcriptional activation of genes encoding a number of phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes, including PAL and CHS (Hahlbrock and Scheel, 1989; Dixon and Hamson, 1991; Gowri et al., 1991; Paiva et al., 1991).

Ex- posure of elicitor-treated bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cell- suspension cultures to exogenous CA leads to a rapid loss of induced PAL enzyme activity (Dixon et al., 1980; Bolwell et al., 1986, 1988). A nondialyzable factor from CA-treated bean cultures stimulates remova1 of PAL activity from en- zyme extracts in vitro; this effect requires the presence of CA (Bolwell et al., 1986), and the CA-mediated appearance of the factor appears to require protein synthesis (Mavandad, 1990). In potato tuber discs, bean cell-suspension cultures, and sunflower hypocotyls, the postinduction decline in PAL activity is blocked by inhibitors of RNA and/or protein syn- thesis in a manner consistent with a requirement for a second regulatory protein affecting PAL remova1 (Lamb, 1979; Dixon et al., 1980; Jorrin et al., 1990). Addition of CA to elicitor- treated bean cultures inhibits the appearance of PAL tran- scripts and a number of polypeptides translated in vitro from polysomal mRNA, although severa1 polypeptides are specif- ically induced by CA treatment (Bolwell et al., 1988; Mavan- dad et al., 1990). Conversely, treatment of elicitor-induced bean cultures with AOPP, a potent and specific inhibitor of PAL activity in vivo (Amrhein and Godeke, 1977), results in increased accumulation of PAL transcripts and enzyme activ- ity (Bolwell et al., 1988; Mavandad et al., 1990). Following exogenous application of CA to elicited bean cultures, CHS transcript levels rapidly decline, and the increase in CHS enzyme activity is arrested, whereas treatment with AOPP results in increased production of CHS transcripts (Bolwell et al., 1988). Overexpression of a bean PAL gene in transgenic tobacco results in an overall decrease in PAL enzyme activity and phenolic levels, which is consistent with CA production being a down-regulatory signal (Elkind et al., 1990). We have chosen cultured alfalfa cells as a model system in which to study the potential regulation of the phenylpropa- noid pathway by early pathway intermediates.

In contrast, 4CA stimulates expression from the chs promoter up to 4.5- fold at 500 PM. Results of these studies suggest that specific cis-elements in the chs promoter may be involved in regula- tion by phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates (Loake et al., 1991) and that alfalfa cells contain the necessary trans- factors for the mediation of these effects. Despite this large body of indirect evidence, the model in which CA or 4CA acts as a natural regulator of flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway in vivo is difficult to test directly. Relatively high concentrations (1 mM) of exoge- nously added CA are required for optimal inhibition of the induction of PAL activity in plant cells. Such concentrations could be cytotoxic (Friend, 1979), resulting in general inhi- bition of transcription, although this has been discounted in bean cells where exogenously applied CA at 1 m~ does not inhibit the levels of a constitutively expressed transcript, H1 (Mavandad et al., 1990), or in alfalfa protoplasts where it does not appear to significantly affect cell viability (Loake et al., 1991). Altematively, some contaminant in the CA sample could be the inhibitory agent. Furthermore, exogenous appli- cation of CA results in its conversion into many metabolites (Edwards et al., 1990), and the use of PAL inhibitors may result in reductions in the levels of many phenylpropanoid- derived compounds. Most important, the levels of free CA and its biosynthetic derivatives have not been determined in most of the previous studies that have suggested regulation by these compounds, and the methods that have been used in severa1 studies have been found to be unreliable (Orr et al., 1993). We have designed a high-resolution GC protocol that allows for the unequivocal determination of endogenous free CA and 4CA levels in alfalfa cells (Orr et al., 1993). We now report correlations between the levels of endogenous phen- ylpropanoid pathway intermediates, PAL transcript levels, and PAL enzymic activity in cells exposed to a number of different experimental manipulations of the flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway. Our data fail to show a direct relation between the levels of the total CA pool (free or conjugated) and changes in PAL transcript levels, although changes in endogenous CA pools brought about by inhibition of PAL or CA4H activities in vivo affect PAL transcripts in a manner consistent with a regulatory role for CA or a close derivative. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials [ C Y - ~ ~ P I ~ A T P  was obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Cinnamic, hydrocinnamic, 4-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, BSTFA, TMSCI, and THF-ds (99.5 atom % deuterium) were obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). AOPP was purchased from Cambridge Research Biochemi- cals (Wilmington, DE), and tetcyclacis was a generous gift from Barbara Moore, BASF (Research Triangle Park, NC). Synthesis of cis-CA truns-CA (2.5 g) was dissolved in THF (90 mL) and irradi- ated at room temperature for 1 h with UV light generated with a 200-W medium-pressure mercury lamp powered by a 200-W source and passed through a vicor sleeve filter (a11 purchased from Ace Glass, Vineland, NJ). The volume of THF was reduced to 2 mL at 35OC in vacuo, and cis-CA was resolved from trans-CA and purified by preparative HPLC using an octadecyl silane column (250 X 22.5 mm with 10-Pm packing) eluted at 10 mL min-' with CH3- CN:HZ0:HCO2H (34.7:64.3:1.0, v/v/v) (tR [cis-, trans-CAI = 18, 22 min, respectively). To confirm the progression of the reaction and identity of the product, trans-CA (9.8 mg) and THF-de (0.5 mL) were placed in an NMR tube, irradiated as above for 15 min, and an NMR spectrum was obtained with a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) XL 300 MHz NMR spectrometer.

DNA Probes A cDNA complementary to an alfalfa PAL (471-bp HindIII interna1 coding region fragment [positions 831-1301]) (Gowri et al., 1991), a 1.6-kb full-length alfalfa CHS cDNA (K. Dalkin, H. Junghans, and R.A. Dixon, unpublished results), and the cDNA clone for the constitutively expressed H1 transcript from bean (Lawton and Lamb, 1987) were used in northem blot analyses as described below. The PAL and CHS probes do not discriminate between different members of the alfalfa pal and chs multigene families. Treatment of Plant Cell Cultures Alfalfa cell-suspension cultures were initiated and main- tained as described previously (Dalkin et al., 1990). Funga1 elicitor was prepared by autoclaving partially purified cell walls of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum as described by Dixon and Lamb (1979), and yeast elicitor was prepared as described by Schumacher et al. (1987). Elicitors and chemicals were added to cultures as filter-sterilized solutions. Dark-grown suspension-cultured cells were treated 5 d after subculture with elicitor at a final concentration of 50 pg of Glc equiva- lents mL-’ of medium, and control cultures were treated with an equivalent volume of water. trans- and cis-CA were added as acetone solutions so that the final phenylpropanoid con- centrations were 1.0 or 0.1 m~ and the final acetone concen- trations were 0.25 or 0.025% (v/v), respectively. AOPP, tetcyclacis, and 4CA were added so that the final concentrations were 50, 50, and 500 p ~ ,  respectively. AOPP was added as an aqueous solution, 4CA was added in Tris- HCl buffer (pH 7), resulting in a final Tris concentration of 160 p ~ ,  and tetcyclacis was added in acetone:water 1:l (v/v) with a final acetone concentration of 0.12% (v/v). Duplicate cell batches were harvested at timed intervals by vacuum filtration through 20-pm nylon mesh, washed with 300 mL of water, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 8 O O C  until required for analysis. lsolation and Analysis of RNA Total RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987) with the following modification: Before reprecipitation of RNA with isopropanol (see table I in Chom- czynski and Sacci, 1987), samples dissolved in solution “d” were placed on ice for 15 min and then clarified by centrif- ugation. The supematant was then removed and processed as described. RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through formal- dehyde-containing agarose gels as described by Maniatis et al. (1989), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as de- scribed by Kroczek and Siebert (1990), and fixed with UV irradiation from a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800. Prehy- bridization was performed in buffer containing 50% form- amide, 6X SSC (1X SSC is 0.15 M NaC1, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5X Denhardt’s reagent, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 pg of sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA mL-’, at 42OC for 16 h. Denatured probe was added (5 X 107 cpm mL-’ for PAL and CHS and 5 X 106 cpm mL-’ for Hl), and hybridization was performed for 16 h. Blots were washed 3 X 20 min with 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65OC. Extraction and Assay of PAL Activity PAL was extracted from cell cultures that had not been treated with AOPP as described by Bolwell et al. (1985b). AOPP-treated cultures (and the corresponding control cul- tures) were extracted for PAL as follows, so as to remove inhibitory AOPP from the crude enzyme extract. Frozen cells (500 mg) were extracted with a blade homogenizer in 1 mL of 50 m~ Tris-HC1, 0.1% (v/v) /3-ME (buffer A) saturated with L-Phe, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the addition of 40 mg of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and cen- trifugation for 10 min, the supematant (1 mL) was concen- trated to 50 to 100 pL with a Centricon-30 Microconcentrator (Amicon, Danvers, MA), combined with 2 mL of buffer A, and reconcentrated, and the last cycle was repeated twice. The final retentate was assayed for PAL enzyme activity. PAL enzyme assays were perfonned using a previously de- scribed spectrophotometric procedure (Bolwell et al., 1985a). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA) dye-binding reagent. Extraction and Determination of Medicarpin, CAs, and CA Conjugates Frozen cells (1.0 g) that had been treated with 1.0 m~ CA were combined with 100 nmol of hydrocinnamic acid (inter- na1 standard) and extracted with a blade homogenizer in 2 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 8.1) containing 1% (v/v) /3-ME. Insoluble material was removed by centrif- ugation at 4OC. The supematant was acidified with 40 pL of 4 N HC1 and extracted with 2 mL of ethyl acetate. The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the ethyl acetate layer was removed, cooled to -4OOC for 1 h, separated from the ice that formed, dried with a stream of N2 at 45OC in a Pierce Model 18800 evaporating unit (Rockford, IL), and used for determination of free CAs. Frozen cells not treated with CA (500 mg) were spiked with hydrocinnamic acid (100 nmol) and extracted with a blade homogenizer in 3 mL of ice-cold ethyl acetate: HC1- KC1 buffer (0.1 M in C1-, pH 2.0):P-ME (2:li0.001, v/v/v). The ethyl acetate layer was removed and dried as described above. Part of the organic extract (20%) was used for medi- carpin determinations, and the remainder was used for de- termination of free CA. Cell extract residues were dissolved in 200 mL of methanol and analyzed for medicarpin by reversed phase HPLC (Koster et al., 1983). Identification of medicarpin was accomplished by cochromatography and by comparing its UV absorption spectrum with that of an authentic standard. Quantification of medicarpin was achieved by calibration with the authentic standard. For determination of free CAs, organic cell extract residues were combined with 100 pL of dry, distilled pyridine, and 100 pL of BSTFA containing TMSCl (l%, v/v) in capped  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Quantification ofcinnamic, hydrocinnamic (internal standard), 4-coumaric,caffeic, and ferulic acids was achieved by calibration withauthentic standards and by normalization with the internalstandard peak. To confirm identities of the different silylatedCAs, corrections with authentic silylated standards wereperformed. The silyl derivatives were also hydrolyzed withdilute acid, and the resultant carboxylic acids were methyl-ated with diazomethane and analyzed again by GC withcoinjection with authentic methyl cinnamate and methyl 4-coumarate. Finally, GC-MS was used to confirm the natureand purity of the CA and 4CA peaks in separated cell extracts(Orr et al., 1993).For determination of CA conjugates, frozen tissues werecombined with 100 nmol of chlorogenic acid (internal stand-ard) and 4 mL of ice-cold acetonitrile and sonicated with aKontes (Vineland, NJ) Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disrupter at 100W for 30 s before centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min at 4°C.The pellet was combined with 4 mL of 50% aqueous aceto-nitrile (prechilled to 4°C), resonicated, and centrifuged asabove. The extracts were combined, and the acetonitrile wasremoved under a stream of N2 at 45°C. The resultant aqueousextracts were adjusted to pH 2.0 with 1 N HC1, loaded ontoan ODS Sep-Pak (Waters, Milford, MA) 1- x 1-cm column,washed with 3.5 mL of 0.01 N HC1, and eluted with 3.5 mLof acetonitrile:water (2:3, v/v). The eluate was dried under astream of N2 at 45°C. The residue was dissolved in 200 jtLof acetonitrile:water (2:3, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation,and 20-fj.L aliquots were analyzed by HPLC using an octa-decyl silane column (250 X 4.6 mm with 5-jum packing)eluted at 1 mL min"1 with a four-step gradient of increasingsolvent B in solvent A of 5% B (5 min), 5 to 10% B (5 min),10 to 35% B (15 min), 35 to 40% B (5 min). Solvent A waswatenformic acid (98:2, v/v), and solvent B was acetoni-trile:formic acid (98:2, v/v). The eluant was monitored forUV A27i; quantification was achieved by calibration with CAand by normalization to the internal standard peak. Confir-mation of identity was made following collection of theputative CA conjugate peaks as follows. Solvent was re-moved under a stream of N2 at 45°C, the residue washydrolyzed at 90°C for 1 h with 2 N HC1 and extracted withethyl acetate ( 3 x 1 mL), and the combined organic layerswere dried and silylated with 100 /iL of BSTFA containingTMSC1 (1%, v/v) and 100 nL of pyridine at 80°C for 15 minand then analyzed for the presence of trimethylsilyl-CA bycapillary GC.sure to 0.1 mM CA. Because of the high concentrations oftrans-CA required to inhibit PAL transcript appearance, it ispossible that some contaminant of the trans-CA preparationcould be the active factor. However, ci's-CA, the most likelypotential contaminant, inhibited PAL transcript appearancein an identical manner with trans-CA at 1 mM and wasprobably less inhibitory at 0.1 mM (based on PAL:H1 ratio).If cis-CA were the active component, the 0.1 mM treatmentwith this compound would be expected to be more inhibitorythan 0.1 mM trans-CA, which was not the case (Fig. 2). Noneof the treatments strongly affected the level of HI transcripts.HI is expressed constitutively in bean cells and exhibits ahigh rate of transcription (and therefore turnover) comparedto PAL (Mavandad et al., 1990). Therefore, it serves as agood control for inhibitory effects of applied chemicals ongeneral transcription and as a reference for correcting gelloading.Because CA is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in beancultures (Edwards et al., 1990), the observed down-regulationof PAL transcript appearance by exogenously applied CAcould be mediated by a metabolite of CA rather than CAitself. To clarify this situation with respect to alfalfa cells, thelevels of free cinnamic, frans-4-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeicacids were determined in cell-suspension cultures treatedwith 1.0 mM CA 4.5 h after treatment with yeast elicitor.Figure 3A shows an HPLC trace of an extract from an alfalfacell suspension after exposure to yeast elicitor for 4.5 h.Addition of 1.0 mM CA to the culture resulted in accumulationof CA, 4CA, and two CA conjugates of retention times of23.1 and 24.3 min (Fig. 3B). The identity of the conjugateswas confirmed by hydrolysis and analysis of the released CAby GLC (data not shown).

By 1.5 h after addition, the level of CA associated with the cells increased from approximately 30 p~ to 1.2 m, a factor of 40, and then slowly decreased during the next 4 h (Fig. 4). Endogenous 4CA levels increased from approximately 9 to 56 PM, indicating flux through the CA4H reaction, whereas no consistent changes were observed in the levels of ferulic and caffeic acids. Thus, down-regulation of PAL caused by addition of CA correlates with increased endogenous levels of CA, 4CA, or CA conjugates but not with ferulic or caffeic acid levels. 4CA has been shown to inhibit the appearance of PAL enzymic activity in elicited bean cells (Dixon et al., 1980) and f li Time aller ellcltatlon (h) Tlme after ellcltatlon (h) Figure 4.

To address further the pos- sibility of 4CA as a regulator of the phenylpropanoid path- way at the transcriptional level, we measured the levels of PAL transcripts in alfalfa cells exposed to exogenously ap- plied 4CA at the concentration that gave maximal up-regu- lation of the bean CHS promoter (Loake et al., 1991). The data in Figure 5 indicate that 4CA delays, but does not prevent, the appearance of elicitor-induced PAL transcripts in the alfalfa cell-suspension cultures.

Effects of Reducing Endogenous CA Levels on Phenylpropanoid Pathway lntermediates and Cene Transcript Levels If high levels of CA, 4CA, or a related metabolite signal reduction of PAL mRNA and enzymic activity levels in vivo, decreasing the levels of these phenylpropanoids should result in a corresponding increase in PAL transcripts or activity. Previous studies have shown that treatment of elicited bean cultures with AOPP, a potent and specific inhibitor of PAL activity, and, therefore, CA production in vivo, results in increased accumulation of PAL transcripts and enzyme activ- ity (Bolwell et al., 1988; Mavandad et al., 1990). However, levels of phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates were not measured in these studies, and no data are available concem- ing the effects of AOPP on PAL transcripts in alfalfa cultures, although the inhibitor has been shown to decrease the ac- cumulation of medicarpin in these cells (Kessmann et al., 1990). The levels of medicarpin, CA, 4CA, PAL transcripts and enzymic activity, and CHS transcripts were strongly induced in alfalfa cell-suspension cultures 4 h after treatment with funga1 elicitor (Table I). Note that in this experiment there was a nearly 10-fold increase in the level of the free CA pool by 4 h postelicitation. Treatment of these cultures with AOPP at zero time caused 34, 91, and 75% reductions in the levels of medicarpin, free CA, and 4CA, respectively, and increased the levels of PAL transcripts, PAL enzymic activity, and CHS Table 1.

The level of PAL enzymic activity in AOPP-treated cultures may be an under- estimate of the actual value because residual AOPP not removed while preparing the enzyme extracts could inhibit the conversion of Phe to CA in the PAL enzyme assay; PAL has a 3 orders of magnitude greater affinity for AOPP than for Phe (Amrhein and Godeke, 1977). In this experiment, only small increases in the levels of PAL enzymic activity and transcripts were associated with the predicted depression of CA and 4CA levels by AOPP. The AOPP treatment did, however, result in a significantly increased appearance of CHS transcripts, consistent with previous results in bean cells in which PAL transcripts and enzymic activity in elicited cells are increased by approxi- mately 2-fold in the presence of AOPP (Bolwell et al., 1988). Having confirmed that AOPP behaved in alfalfa cells in a manner essentially similar to its effects on bean cells, we attempted to test further the model of pathway intermediate regulation by examining the effects of an agent that would be predicted to increase endogenous CA pools in vivo. Effeds of lncreasing Endogenous CA Levels on Phenylpropanoid Pathway lntermediates and Cene Transcript Levels In the experiment shown in Figures 6 and 7, alfalfa cell- suspension cultures treated with yeast elicitor alone exhibited no changes in the levels of free CA (in contrast to the data in Table I), although it should be noted that no measurements were made in the experiments shown in Figure 7 beyond 8 h postelicitation, and PAL transcripts had not significantly declined by this time (Fig. 6A). Also, no changes were ob- served in caffeic acid and H1 transcript levels, whereas the levels of medicarpin, 4CA, PAL mRNA, and PAL enzymic activity were a11 induced (Figs. 6 and 7). Concomitant treat- ment with elicitor and tetcyclacis (an inhibitor of CA4H activity in vivo [Rademacher et al., 19871) caused a 4- to 5- fold increase in the level of CA between 2 and 4 h postelici- tation (Fig. 7A) and inhibited 4CA and medicarpin accumu- lation (Fig. 7, B and D) but had no effect on caffeic acid levels (Fig. 7C). This treatment blocked accumulation of PAL tran- scripts and enzymic activity for up to 2 h postaddition and reduced their levels at later times (Fig. 6, A and C). Tetcyclacis had no significant effect on the levels of H1 transcripts (Fig. 6B). Addition of tetcyclacis to cells 2 h after elicitation caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in CA levels and inhibited the accumu- lation of 4CA, medicarpin, and PAL enzymic activity but had no effect on caffeic acid levels. PAL transcript accumulation was reduced 2 h after tetcyclacis treatment but not at later times. Again, delayed tetcyclacis treatment had no effect on H1 transcript levels, indicating that the effects on PAL mRNA are not the result of a nonspecific inhibition of transcription. These results further show that manipulation of CA levels in vivo has predictable effects on PAL transcript levels, consistent with the hypothesis that the endogenous level of CA or some derivative thereof can signal regulation of PAL mRNA and enzymic activity levels. However, if we assume the rapid uptake and effectiveness of tetcyclacis in blocking CA4H activity, the delayed accumulation of free CA shown  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Bars indicate spread of duplicate determinations (extractions of separate cell batches). in Figure 7A in relation to the inhibition of PAL transcript appearance would tend to rule out a role for the bulk pool of free CA as a regulatory signal. Therefore, we investigated whether accumulation of any conjugate of CA occurred dur- ing the inhibition of PAL transcript appearance and before the increase in free CA levels in the cells analyzed in Figures 6 and 7. Two major CA conjugates were detected when exogenous CA was fed to alfalfa cells. These had HPLC retention times of 23.1 and 24.3 min, respectively (Fig. 3). Treatment of elicited cells with tetcyclacis resulted in increased levels of both conjugates (Fig. 7, E and F), indicating that prevention of the hydroxylation of CA leads to spillover into conjugation pathways. However, there was no apparent increase in the level of either conjugate by 2 h postelicitation, at which time the level of PAL transcripts had been reduced by the tetcy- clacis treatment. Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that the observed increase in either of these conjugates plays a role in regulating PAL transcript levels. Changes in Phenylpropanoid Pathway lntermediates in Response to Elicitor Alone In the absence of tetcyclacis (i.e. in cells treated with elicitor alone), there was no significant increase in CA levels during the first 8 h postelicitation in the experiment shown in Figure 7A, whereas in the experiment shown in Table I, a 10-fold increase in CA levels was observed by 4 h postelicitation. A major difference between these two experiments was the use of elicitor from C. lindemuthianum for the AOPP experiment and yeast elicitor for the tetcyclacis experiment. Therefore, we compared, in a separate experiment, the effects of the two elicitors on the levels of free and conjugated CA and 4CA (Fig. 8). Alfalfa cells treated with fungal elicitor responded differ- ently from those treated with yeast elicitor. Treatment with yeast elicitor resulted in maximum levels of free CA and 4CA at 4 and 10 h postelicitation, respectively, whereas treatment with fungal elicitor resulted in an apparent increase in free CA levels at 10 h postelicitation and a decrease in free 4CA 40 D 40 A in; 10 O 2 4 6 8  O 2 4 6 8  I O 2 4 6 8  O 2 4 6 8  40 Time after elicitation (h) Time after elicitation (h) Figure 7.

Treatment with yeast elicitor resulted in maximum levels of CA and 4CA conjugates 2 and 6 h postelicitation, respectively (Fig. 8, C and D). Treatment with fungal elicitor resulted in decreased levels of conjugated CA, whereas levels of conjugated 4CA were slightly elevated at 2 h postelicitation. Thus, in contrast to the data shown in Figure 7, the levels of phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates in this experiment changed significantly during elicitation, but the extent and timing of the changes depended on the elicitor used. Note that the data in Figure 8 refer to total conjugate levels and do not distinguish between different potential conjugates of CA and 4CA. The levels of the various CAs were measured further in a separate experiment in which we previously had determined striking transient changes in PAL transcripts, CHS transcripts, and PAL enzyme activity in response to yeast elicitor (Fig. 9). These cell-suspension cultures accumulated high levels of medicarpin, confirming that the phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway was induced (Fig. 9F). In contrast to the data shown in Figure 8, treatment with yeast elicitor had little effect on the already low CA pool size in the cells used in this experi- ment (Fig. 9C). There is, therefore, no consistent relationship between the bulk CA pool and the onset of the decline in elicitor-induced PAL transcripts. A rapid, transient, 4-fold increase in the leve1 of 4CA was observed on elicitation, with only a slight increase in caffeic acid levels (Fig. 9, D and E). In contrast to the lack of change in the free CA pool, the levels of the two major conjugates of CA, especially the fR = 24.3 min conjugate, increased on elicitation, although not until at least 2 h after exposure to elicitor (Fig. 9, G and H). This increase precedes the decrease in PAL enzyme activity, but not PAL transcript levels, in these cultures. DISCUSSION The previous studies that have led to the proposal of a role for CA and 4CA as potential modulators of the phenylpro- panoid pathway at both transcriptional and posttranscrip- tional levels did not determine the endogenous levels of these compounds in relation to the changes they were proposed to be modulating. We had found it difficult to accurately and unambiguously determine the levels of endogenous free CA in legume cell cultures. Previous methods relied on HPLC analyses of crude cell extracts, but they appeared unreliable, at least in alfalfa cells, because CA was not resolved from a cochromatographing substance (Fig. 3A). We have now used a high-resolution capillary GC method that resolves CA and 4CA from a11 components of the plant cell extracts (Orr et al., 1993). Determinations of caffeic and femlic acids by this method are sometimes hampered by cochromatographing material; the levels of these compounds were measured in each experiment in the present paper but are only reported when they were clearly resolved. To test the hypothesis that CA and its metabolites may act as endogenous regulators of PAL and CHS expression, we have monitored the changes in the levels of CA and some of its biosynthetic products in relation to changes in the levels of PAL transcripts and enzymic activity in alfalfa cell cultures under a variety of conditions. If we assume no subcellular compartmentalization, the present data indicate overall concentrations of free CA and 4CA in alfalfa cells to be in the range of approximately 5 to 30 PM, whereas levels of total conjugated CA and 4CA were much higher. This is consistent with previous observations in bean (Bolwell et al., 1985b). Exogenously added CA or 4CA at 100 p~ can cause significant down-regulation and up-regulation, respectively, of chs promoter expression in alfalfa protoplasts (Loake et al., 1991). The endogenous pool sizes of these compounds in alfalfa cells would, therefore, appear sufficient to regulate the expression of phenylpropa- noid pathway biosynthetic genes, especially because it is unlikely that the concentration of each compound is equal throughout the cell.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

FW, Fresh weight. Feeding exogenous CA to the alfalfa cultures resulted in a striking increase in CA associated with the cells (a11 of which may not be intemalized) and a significant (6-fold) increase in endogenous 4CA levels. Because feeding of CA did not affect the levels of caffeic and ferulic acids, it is unlikely that these later phenylpropanoid compounds are the mediators of the CA effect. This is supported by earlier data that indicated that exogenously supplied caffeic and ferulic acids were far less active inhibitors of PAL activity appearance in bean cell cultures than were CA or 4CA (Dixon et al., 1980). Also, our data rule out the possibility that contaminating cis-CA is responsible for the down-regulation of PAL by exogenously added truns-CA. Both isomers of CA appear equally effective in inhibiting PAL transcript appearance. In contrast, earlier studies have shown that cis-CA, unlike the truns isomer, is not inhibitory to PAL enzymic activity in vitro (Koukol and Conn, 1961; Engelsma, 1974). Exogenously applied 4CA delays PAL transcript appear- ance by approximately 2 h in elicited alfalfa cells but does not inhibit the final transcript level obtained (Fig. 5). We do not know whether the recovery from this delay is due to subsequent metabolism of 4CA and cannot, therefore, une- quivocally rule out a role for 4CA as a regulator of PAL transcription, although this is not consistent with the results of the tetcyclacis experiment (Figs. 6 and 7). The results of exogenous CA feeding experiments (Bolwell et al., 1986, 1988; Mavandad et al., 1990; Loake et al., 1991) and the superinduction phenomena with AOPP (Bolwell et al., 1988; Mavandad et al., 1990; Table I) do not rule out the possibility that 4CA could be a natural regulator of PAL expression at the enzyme level. This is supported by the kinetics of changes in endogenous 4CA levels observed in elicited cells in Figure 9D in relation to the corresponding changes in PAL enzyme activity (but not transcripts). In spite of the variation in changes in CA levels in the various experiments reported in this paper, the levels of CA plus 4CA increase in a11 cases between 4 and 10 h postelicitation. This increase could signal remova1 of active enzyme, a phenomenon known to be induced by exogenously added CA and dependent on protein synthesis (Dixon et al., 1980; Bolwell et al., 1986; Jomn et al., 1990). If free CA were to be an in vivo regulator of PAL transcrip- tion, the following would be predicted: (a) inhibiting the accumulation of CA in vivo would result in increased PAL expression (at the transcript and enzyme activity levels), (b) stimulating the accumulation of CA in vivo (either by exog- enously f eeding or artificially increasing endogenously formed pools) would result in decreased PAL expression, and (c) endogenous CA pools might increase before the decline phase in elicitor-induced PAL transcripts and enzyme activ- ity. The data in this paper indicate that the first two criteria are met but that changes in endogenous CA levels on elici- tation do not necessarily relate to changes in PAL transcripts and enzyme activity; indeed, strong down-regulation of el- icitor-induced PAL transcripts and activity can occur with no significant change in the levels of free CA (Fig. 9). Further- more, when CA4H activity is blocked by tetcyclacis (con- firmed by inhibition of 4CA appearance and increased ap- pearance of CA and CA conjugates), PAL transcript levels are affected before the detectable increase in the CA and CA conjugate pools (Figs. 6 and 7). Two hypotheses accord with the above findings. First, the lack of a consistent increase in CA pool size at the time of PAL transcriptional regulation could simply reflect the fact that the pool of CA involved in regulation is too small to detect in relation to the total cellular pool. The level of CA formed from elicitor-induced PAL activity depends on the relative activities of PAL and the enzymes removing CA (CA4H and conjugation enzymes) during the early stages of elicitation (Durst, 1976). PAL activity will obviously be low, and most of the initially formed CA may be channeled into other metabolites. CA4H is located in the microsomes, and the size of this microsomally channeled pool may be sensed in some manner and the signal transduced to regulate PAL gene expression. An altemative model could involve the  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 4, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.856 Orr et al. Plant Physiol. Vol. 101, 1993 presence of a threshold concentration of CA or a metabolite/ conjugate that is inhibitory to PAL gene activation. Elicitation would require a decrease in the concentration of this inhibitor along with a positive regulatory signal for the elicitation response. The kinetics of change in the levels of such a regulatory molecule would be rapid and  transient, decreasing a t  the onset of PAL gene activation and returning above a n  inhibitory threshold leve1 a t  the onset of the decline in the rate of PAL transcript appearance. Work is in progress to determine whether the levels of any CA derivatives might change in  elicited cells in  such a manner. ACKNOWLEDCMENTS We thank BASF Corp.
