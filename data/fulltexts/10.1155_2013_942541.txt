The structures of two new compounds were determined on thebasis of spectroscopic analysis including 1D-, 2D-NMR, and MS techniques. Two assays were conducted: inhibition of tumornecrosis factor-alpha (TNF-𝛼) and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-𝜅B) in RAW264. 7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide(LPS). It was observed that compounds 1, 2 and 7 showed significant inhibition of TNF-𝛼 production and NF-𝜅B release. Themolecule docking results showed that compounds 1 and 2 got high fitness scores with dual specificity mitogen-activated proteinkinase kinase 1 (MPKK1), whose activation plays a pivotal role between TNF-𝛼 and activation of NF-𝜅B. The anti-HIV-1 potencyof compounds 1–5 was also discussed, in addition to the results of computer-aided screening for targets.1. IntroductionNatural products have been, and continue to be, a majorsource of pharmacologically active substances from whichdrugs can be developed [1]. Medicinal plants that can relieverheumatism, chills, and pains according to traditional Chi-nese medicine theory are fit for use by rheumatism sufferers.From these plants, many constituents with proved anti-inflammatory activity have been isolated and their structureswere determined by spectroscopic methods.I. difengpi (Illiciaceae), the stem bark of which has beenapplied for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as a traditionalChinese medicine, is a small shrub growing in mountainareas of Guangxi province in China. I. difengpi is listed inChinese Pharmacopoeia. In previous phytochemical investi-gation of barks of I. difengpi thirty compounds were isolatedincluding dominant phenylpropanoids and neolignans [2–4] together with four sesquiterpene lactones [5] and threetriterpenoids [6]. The anti-inflammatory activities of severalneolignans were assayed by measuring the inhibitory ratioof 𝛽-glucuronidase release in rat PMNs induced by PAF invitro [2, 5]. The sesquiterpene lactones were predicted toexhibit neurotrophic activity [7–9]. However, there have beenlimited studies that focus on the triterpenoids from I. difengpiand of the family Illiciaceae. Until now, only six cycloartanes[6, 10, 11] were reported to be isolated from family Illiciaceae,while from family Schisandraceae (Schisandra and Kadsura,order Illiciales) more than 150 triterpenoids [12] have beenisolated. In particular, they both contain seco-cycloartanetriterpenoids. These characteristic chemical structures fromthe Schisandraceae and their activities were widely studied.Most of the seco-cycloartanes from the family Schisandraceaewere demonstrated to possess anti-HIV-1 activity.As a part of our study to find the active constituents,an investigation of I. difengpi was undertaken, leading toisolation and structural elucidation of two new 3,4;9,10-seco-cycloartane triterpenoids and three known triterpenoidstogether with two squalenes. In order to shed some light on2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinebiological activities, the anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV-1properties of the isolates were evaluated and discussed.2. Materials and Methods2.1. General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations weremeasured using a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. IR spectrawere recorded on aNEXUS 470 FT-IR spectrometer (ThermoNicolet, USA). 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT) and 2D (COSY, NOESY,HSQC, HMBC) NMR spectra were acquired on a BrukerAvance 600 NMR spectrometer operating at 600 (1H) or 150(13C) MHz using the residual solvent signals as an internalreference (CDCl3𝛿H 7.26 ppm, 𝛿C 77.0 ppm). NMR sampleswere in 3mm Shigemi tubes during NMR analyses. High-resolution mass spectrometric data were obtained on anAgilent 6220 TOF LC/MS instrument (Agilent Technolo-gies, MA, USA) with ESI ionization in the positive mode.Column chromatography (CC) was performed on SephadexLH-20 gel (40–70 𝜇m, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB,Uppsala, Sweden), YMC-GRL ODS-A (50 𝜇m; YMC, MA,USA), and silica gel H (100–200 and 200–300mesh, QingdaoHaiyang Chemical Co. Ltd., Qingdao, China). TLC analyseswere performed on Si60F254plates and visualized under UVlight or by heating after spraying with 10% H2SO4/EtOHsolution. Semipreparative RP-HPLC isolation was achievedwith an Agilent 1200 instrument using a YMC 5 𝜇m C18column (250mm × 10 nm) eluted with 80% MeCN/H2Oat 1-2mL/min. Peak detection was made with a refractiveindex detector (RID). The positive controls in the anti-inflammatory assaywere tripterygium tablets (TRT) and totalglucosides of paeony (TGP). Purity was assessed by HPLCand determined to be 95% or greater for compounds 1–7 atthe time of testing.2.2. Plant Material. The stem barks of Illicium difengpi werepurchased from Caitongde Pharmacy, Shanghai, China, inJanuary 2010. Plant material was authenticated by Profes-sor Lianna Sun (Department of Pharmacognosy, School ofPharmacy, Second Military Medical University) based onmorphological characters. Voucher specimen (No. 20100110)has been deposited at the Herbarium of Department of Phar-macognosy, School of Pharmacy, Second Military MedicalUniversity, Shanghai, China.2.3. Extraction and Isolation. The air-dried stem bark of I.difengpi (40 kg) was powdered and extracted three times with80% ethanol under reflux. The solvent was concentrated toobtain a crude extract (1200 g) which was suspended in water(10 L) and extracted with petroleum ether (10 L × 3), EtOAc(10 L × 3), and BuOH (10 L × 3), affording 40, 560, and 300 gof each dried fraction, respectively.The dried petroleum ether fraction (Fr.1) (40 g) was chro-matographed on silica gel column (CC) (80 × 5 cm, gradientwith petroleum ether: EtOAc = 100 : 0→ 0 : 100) to give eightmain fractions (Fr.1-1–Fr.1−8), among which Fr.1-2 gave com-pound 7 (27mg), Fr.1−7provided compound 6 (85mg), andFr.1−8afforded compound 3 (34mg) through Sephadex LH-20 CC (150 × 2 cm, CH2Cl2: MeOH= 1 : 1).The EtOAc extract(Fr.2) (560 g) was chromatographed on silica gel CC (150 ×10 cm, gradient with CH2Cl2: MeOH = 300 : 1→ 0 : 100) togive four main fractions (Fr.2-1–Fr.2−4). Fr.2-2 was subjectedto silica gel CC (20 × 2 cm, gradient with petroleum ether:EtOAc = 100 : 1→ 1 : 1) affording a mixture of compounds 4and 5.Themixture was rechromatographed using silicaODS-A gel CC (20 × 2 cm, gradient with MeOH: H2O = 1 : 1→1 : 0) to give pure compounds 4 (45mg) and 5 (21mg). Fr.2-3was fractionated by silica gel CC (35 × 3 cm, gradient withpetroleum ether: EtOAc = 100 : 1→ 5 : 1) to yield three sub-fractions (Fr.2-3-1–Fr.2-3-3). Fr.2-3-3 was rechromatographedusing semipreparative HPLC system (Agilent 1200 series;YMCHPLCC18 column-5𝜇m, 250 × 10mm, refractive indexdetector; flow 2mL/min; mobile phaseMeCN: H2O= 80 : 20)to give pure compounds 1 (8mg) and 2 (2.5mg).2.4.

Inhibition of TNF-𝛼 Release Assay. Isolated compoundswere tested for their ability to inhibit TNF-𝛼 release fromLPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a quantitative assay.Tripterygium tablets (TRT) and total glucosides of paenia(TGP) were used as positive controls. The ELISA Max setstandard (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) was performedaccording to the manufacturer’s instruction strictly. Theinhibition ratio (IR) was calculated as IR (%) = (𝐴LPS −𝐴S)/𝐴LPS × 100%, where𝐴LPS and𝐴S refer to the amount ofTNF-𝛼 in cells pretreated with LPS and samples, respectively.2.6. Inhibition of NF-𝜅B Release Assay. The effect ofcompounds 1–7 on NF-𝜅B production from LPS-treatedRAW264.7 cells was monitored. Tripterygium tablets (TRT)and total glucosides of paeony (TGP) were used as positivecontrols. Cells were placed on 96-well plates (Costar) ata density of 1.0 × 105 cells mL−1, maintained in DMEMcontaining 10% FBS for 24 h. After changing the medium,the samples were incubated at 37∘C with 5% CO2for 4 h,and 1 𝜇g/mL LPS was then added and incubated for another48 h. After 48 h, cells were collected and completely crackedusing 1× lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for5min, the supernatant was obtained. 100𝜇L luciferase assayreagent and 20𝜇L cell lysate were added to it in orderrapidly. The detection results were read in 10 s. The IRwas calculated in a similar way to the above formula,IR (%) = (𝐼LPS − 𝐼S)/𝐼LPS × 100%, where 𝐼LPS and 𝐼S refer tothe fluorescence intensity of cells pretreated with LPS andsamples, respectively.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3Table 1: 1H-NMR (600MHz) and 13C-NMR (150MHz) data for compounds 1 and 2 (CDCl3, 𝛿H in ppm, 𝐽 in Hz).Position 1 2𝛿C, mult. 𝛿H 𝛿C, mult. 𝛿H1 31.5, CH22.33 (m, Hb-1)1.77–1.84 (m, Ha-1)31.5, CH22.30–2.36 (m, Hb-1)1.70–1.76 (m, Ha-1)2 29.6, CH22.41–2.48 (m, Ha-2)2.41–2.48 (m, Hb-2)29.6, CH22.42–2.48 (m, Ha-2)2.42–2.48 (m, Hb-2)3 177.3, qC — 177.3, qC —4 146.6, qC — 146.6, qC —5 54.8, CH 2.54 (d, 9.6, H-5) 54.8, CH 2.56 (d, 9.8, H-5)6 31.4, CH21.65–1.70 (m, Ha-6)1.82–1.89 (m, Hb-6)31.4, CH21.61–1.67 (m, Ha-6)1.82–1.89 (m, Hb-6)7 30.5, CH21.46–1.51 (m, Ha-7)1.79–1.83 (m, Hb-7)30.5, CH21.41–1.46 (m, Ha-7)1.72–1.77 (m, Hb-7)8 48.4, CH 1.43 (dd, 3.2, 7.0, H-8) 48.4, CH 1.42–1.47 (m, H-8)9 31.7, CH 1.90 (td, 7.4, 14.0, H-9) 31.7, CH 1.85–1.92 (m, H-9)10 91.7, qC — 91.7, qC —11 29.6, CH21.23 (m, Ha-11)1.73 (m, Hb-11)29.6, CH21.46 (m, Ha-11)1.73 (m, Hb-11)12 32.7, CH21.61–1.64 (m, Ha-12)1.75–1.80 (m, Hb-12)32.7, CH21.61–1.64 (m, Ha-12)1.75–1.80 (m, Hb-12)13 45.5, qC — 45.5, qC —14 49.2, qC — 49.2, qC —15 33.3, CH21.06–1.14 (m, Ha-15)1.23–1.28 (m, Hb-15)34.0, CH20.97–1.02 (m, Ha-15)1.23–1.25 (m, Hb-15)16 27.9, CH21.37–1.42 (m, Ha-16)1.92–1.98 (m, Hb-16)27.8, CH21.47 (m, Ha-16)1.92–1.98 (m, Hb-16)17 51.0, CH 1.49–1.53 (m, H-17) 50.9, CH 1.49–1.55 (m, H-17)18 14.7, CH3 0.80 (s, H3-18) 14.7, CH3 0.80 (s, H3-18)19 49.2, CH21.64–1.70 (m, Ha-19)1.77–1.83 (m, Hb-19)49.2, CH21.64–1.70 (m, Ha-19)1.78–1.83 (m, Hb-19)20 35.9, CH 1.37–1.47 (m, H-20) 36.4, CH 1.51–1.55 (m, H-20)21 18.3, CH3 0.86 (d, 7.22, H3-21) 18.6, CH3 0.88 (d, 6.5, H3-21)22 33.1, CH21.13–1.20 (m, Ha-22)1.35–1.40 (m, Hb-22)33.3, CH21.13–1.20 (m, Ha-22)1.35–1.40 (m, Hb-22)23 28.3, CH21.36 (m, Ha-23)1.14–1.22 (m, Hb-23)28.6, CH21.36 (m, Ha-23)1.09–1.14 (m, Hb-23)24 78.7, CH 3.31 (t, 6.2, H-24) 79.6, CH 3.27 (dd, 9.5, 1.6, H-24)25 73.2, qC — 73.2, qC —26 23.2, CH3 1.14 (s, H3-26) 23.2, CH3 1.15 (s, H3-26)27 26.6, CH3 1.19 (s, H3-27) 26.5, CH3 1.21 (s, H3-27)28 16.6, CH3 0.83 (s, H3-28) 16.7, CH3 0.84 (s, H3-28)29 22.6, CH3 1.76 (s, H3-29) 22.6, CH3 1.77 (s, H3-29)30 115.0, CH24.80 (s, Ha-30)4.91 (s, Hb-30)115.0, CH24.81 (s, Ha-30)4.92 (s, Hb-30)2.7. Statistical Analysis. The statistical significance of dif-ferences was determined by two-tailed Student’s 𝑡-test forunpaired data.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Structure Analysis. Illiciumolide A (1) was isolated asa yellowish solid. The positive HRESI-MS analysis showeda pseudo-molecular ion at 𝑚/𝑧 475.3774 [M+H]+, consis-tent with the formula C30H50O4(calcd. 474.3709), whichaccounted for six degrees of unsaturation. IR (KBr) absorp-tion bands were observed as 3402 cm−1 (OH), 2929 cm−1(CH3), 1763 cm−1 (C=O), 1377 cm−1 (CH2), and 899 cm−1(C=CH2). The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra exhibited thirtyresonances, including six quaternary carbons, six methines,twelve methylenes, and six methyls. Among these, five4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineHOOHHOOHOOHHHHH367R1234 56 7891011 1213141516171819 20212223 24 252627292830R11R = (24R)-OH2 R = (24S)-OH4 R1 = COOH5 R1 = CH3Figure 1: Structures of compounds 1–7.primary methyls (𝛿C 14.7, H3-18; 𝛿C 16.6, H3-28; 𝛿C 22.6,H3-29; 𝛿C 23.2, H3-26; 𝛿C 26.5, H3-27) and a secondarymethyl (𝛿C 18.3,H3-21)were determined as evident from theirmultiplicities in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1). The 13CNMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of one lactonecarbonyl carbon (𝛿C 177.3) and a pair of olefinic carbons(𝛿C 146.6, 𝛿C 115.0). Taking into consideration the presenceof a pair of methylene protons (𝛿H 4.80 and 4.91) in the1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1), these features indicatedthe existence of a terminal methylene group in accordancewith the IR spectrum absorption.The oxygenated quaternarycarbon appeared at the low field 𝛿C 91.7, together with thelactone carbonyl carbon (𝛿C 177.3), suggesting that the C-3 (𝛿C 177.3) may lactonize to C-10 (𝛿C 91.7) forming afive-membered lactone ring, which required future analysisof HMBC and 1H-1H COSY. Apart from two degrees ofunsaturation occupied by one double bond and one carbonyl,the remaining four degrees of unsaturation indicated that 1should possess a tetracyclic system. Detailed comparison ofthe 1Hand 13CNMRspectra of 1with those of schisanterpeneA [13] suggested a similar structure for rings A–D in bothcompounds and might be derived from cycloartane typetriterpenoids, but a pair of double bonds between C-24 andC-25 and the carboxyl group at C-26 in schisanterpene Awas absent in 1, which instead exhibited vicinal diol (C-24, 𝛿C 78.7; C-25, 𝛿C 73.2) and two methyls (C-26, 𝛿C 23.2;C-27, 𝛿C 26.5). As a result, 1 was tetracyclic and belongedto 3,4;9,10-seco-type triterpenoids [13, 14]. Subsequently, thestructure was fully elucidated by 2D NMR spectroscopy. TheH2-1, H2-2, and H-5 showed distant correlations with C-3, C-10, and C-19, coupled with 1H-1H COSY correlationof H-1/H-2 (Figure 2), consistent with the lactone ring (A)substructure. A detailed analysis of its HSQC, HMBC and1H-1H COSY spectra confirmed that 1 contained a seven-membered ring (B) evident as the HMBC correlations fromH-5 to C-10, from H-6 to C-8, from H-7 to C-5, and C-9and from H-19 to C-9 and C-10, as well as 1H-1H COSYcorrelations of H-5/H-6/H-7 and H8/H-9 (Figure 2). Thestructure of rings C and D was deduced from the 1H-1HCOSY correlations of H-9/H-11/H-12 and H-15/H-16/H-17and HMBC correlations from H3-13 to C-8 and C-15, H3-14 to C-12 and C-17, and H-11 to C-19 and C-14. From theabove deduction, compound 1 and schisanterpene A wereconfirmed to have the similar structure in rings A–D, whilethe chain fromC-17 was verifiably different. Further evidencesupporting chain structure was provided by the presence ofthe correlations of H-15/H-16, H-21/H-20, H-22/H-23, andH-23/H-24 as deduced from the COSY spectrum andHMBCEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 51H-1H COSYOHOHOOHMBC (H→C)Figure 2: Key 1H-1H COSY (bold lines) and HMBC (H→C)correlations of compound 1.correlation from H-23 to C-20. Furthermore, the vicinal diolwith two methyls termination was proved from the HMBCevident correlations from H3-26 (H3-27) to C-24 and C-25(Figure 2). The relative stereochemistry of compound 1 wasdeduced from NOESY correlations (Figure 3). The oxygenatom of the spiroring on C-10 was in the 𝛼-orientation, as theNOESY correlations between H-2𝛽 and H2-19 and H-1𝛽 andH3-29 are the same as those of schinalactone B. Correlationsbetween H-5𝛼 with H-7𝛼 and H-9 clearly showed that theseprotons were on the same face. Other important NOESYcorrelations were observed between H-9 and H-11𝛼 and H3-28, andH-7𝛼/H-16𝛼, indicating that H3-28 was 𝛼-orientationwhile H3-18 was on the other side. Finally about the C-17side chain, the intense cross-peaks between H-16𝛼, H-17, andH3-21 suggested that both H-17 and C-21 have 𝛼 orientationin 1. Except for 24-OH, the relative configurations of 1 werethe same as schinalactone B. The 24-OH configuration wasdeduced by the resonances of protons and carbons at C-23,C-24, and C-25 and by the 𝐽 values between H-23 and H-24(𝐽 = 6.2Hz). In the previous literature, 𝐽 value between H-23 and H-24 in 24R-configuration was reported to be around6.5 and 1.0Hz, while that in 24S-configuration was around10.5 and 1.9Hz [15, 16]. Comparison with the literature dataand significant NOE correlations between H-24 and H-23𝛼, alone with modeling in Chem3D 11.0 (Cambridge Soft,Inc.) as shown in Figure 3, both suggested 24-OH was R-configuration. Based on these evidences, the structure of 1was determined to be 24R,25-dihydroxy-3,4;9,10-seco-4(28)-cycloarten-10,3-olide (Figure 1).Illiciumolide B (2) was obtained as a yellowish solidwith molecular formula C30H50O4established by positiveHRESI-MS (𝑚/𝑧 475.3765 [M+H]+, calcd. for 475.3784).Both compounds 1 and 2 have the same molecular formula,suggesting that they are isomer. The 1H and 13C NMRspectra of 1 were quite similar to those of 2. In comparisonwith their 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1), it was foundthat the chemical shifts of C-20, C-21, C-22, C-23, and C-24 were slightly different, while the other chemical shiftsremained unchanged. These suggested that compound 2was a stereoisomer of 1, which was confirmed by the NOEspectrum. In the NOE experiments, correlation signal from125199281720212324262522291H-1H NOEFigure 3: Key NOE correlations of compound 1.H-24 to H-23𝛽 (𝛿H 1.09–1.14) in 2 was observed, while H-24 to H-23𝛼 (𝛿H 1.36) in compound 1 was observed. Besides,the 𝐽 value between H-23 and H-24 (𝐽 = 9.5, 1.6Hz) wasdifferent with that (𝐽 = 6.2Hz) of compound 1. By compar-ison with the literature [15, 16], compound 2 was deducedto be 24S-configuration. Therefore, compound 2 was elu-cidated as 24S,25-dihydroxy-3,4;9,10-seco-4(28)-cycloarten-10,3-olide (Figure 1). The spectra of Illiciumolide A and Bare presented in Supplementary Materials available online athttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/942541, including MS, IR, andNMR spectra.In addition to the two new compounds, the knowntriterpenoids 3 [15, 17, 18], 4 [19, 20], and 5 [21, 22], andsqualenes 6 [23] and 7 [24] were also isolated from the I.difengpi. This is the first report on isolation of compounds3, 6, and 7 and 3,4-seco- and 3,4;9,10-seco-type triterpenoidsfrom I. difengpi.3.2. Bioactivities Analysis3.2.1. Inhibition of TNF-𝛼 Release Assay. The antiinflamma-tory activities of compounds 1–7 at 25 𝜇g/mL were assessedby determining the inhibitory ratio of TNF-𝛼 release in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages in vitro. Tripterygiumtablets (TRT) and total glucosides of paenia (TGP) were usedas positive controls. As shown in Figure 4, the concentrationsof TNF-𝛼 in the RAW 264.7 cells pretreated with compounds1, 2, and 7 were reduced by 90%, 85%, and 91%, respectively,compared to LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, while theinhibitory rates of two positive controls TRT and TGP were59% and 49%, respectively. These results demonstrated thatcompounds 1, 2, and 7 had a significant inhibitory effect onTNF-𝛼 release from macrophages.3.2.2. Inhibition of NF-𝜅B Release Assay. Based on the resultsobtained from TNF-𝛼 release experiments, compounds 1–7 were further assessed for their possible effect on NF-𝜅Bproduction from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. Thecytotoxic effects of tested compounds on LPS-stimulatedRAW 264.7 cells were determined initially. The resultsshowed that compounds 1–5 did not affect cell viabilityat concentrations up to 25𝜇g/mL and 6 and 7 did up to100 𝜇g/mL.

Binding prop-erties for compounds 1, 3, 4, and 5 on various inflammationrelated ligands were estimated by computer-aided moleculardocking. The results showed that all these compounds hadgood binding with dual specificity mitogen-activated proteinkinase kinase 1 (MPKK1), whose activation is involved inthe upstream of NF-𝜅B signal pathway [1], followed by pro-duction of many proinflammatory cytokines as well as otherimportant inflammation-released proteins (see Table 2).Similar computer-aided molecule docking to screen tar-gets had been calculated and several ligands, including gag-pol polyprotein, protease, androgen receptor, and renin,exhibited high fit score and norm fit score (Table 3).3.3. Discussion. This is the first time that 3,4;9,10-seco-typecycloartane triterpenoids were isolated from I. difengpi andfrom genus Illicium. There has been only five cycloartanetriterpenoids [10], two of which were 3,4-seco-cycloartanetype triterpenoids [11], isolated from family Illiciaceae. Theseseco-cycloartane types of triterpenoids have been extensivelyisolated from family Schisandraceae, especially 46 com-pounds of 3,4-seco-cycloartane type out of 166 triterpenoidstotally [22]. It was widely accepted that family Illiciaceaehas close relationship with theSchisandraceae (Schisandraand Kadsura) and both of them were under the Illiciales.The common possession of the seco-cycloartanes in both I.difengpi and the Schisandraceae is of great significance.I. difengpi is included in Chinese Pharmacopoeia forits traditional treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). InRA patients, TNF-𝛼 levels are elevated in RA synovial1009080706050402030100∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗Inhibition of NF-𝜅Bproduction (%)NormalLPSTRTTGP6 7Tested compound number90𝜇g/mL30𝜇g/mL10𝜇g/mL(a)100806040200∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗Inhibition of NF-𝜅Bproduction (%)NormalLPSTRTTGP1 2 3 4 5Tested compound number20𝜇g/mL10𝜇g/mL5𝜇g/mL(b)Figure 5: Inhibitory rate of NF-𝜅B production from LPS-stimulatedRAW 264.7 cells by (a) Compounds 6-7 at three concentrations90 𝜇g/mL, 30 𝜇g/mL, and 10𝜇g/mL.

Macrophages areimportant cells implicated in the initiation of inflammatoryresponses, so the agents that inhibit TNF-𝛼 production havebeen studied almost exclusively in these cells. The objectiveof this present study was to investigate the potential activitiesagainst RA of triterpenoids isolated from the I. difengpiagainst RA. The main focus was to explore the attenuationof LPS-induced acute inflammatory response under in vitroconditions. Our research results suggested that triterpenoids1, 2, and 7maymodulatemacrophages responsiveness to LPS.These three compounds reduced the production of TNF-𝛼stimulated with LPS. However, the molecular mechanismsof the induction of TNF-𝛼 production in RAW264.7 cells inresponse to LPS remain incompletely understood. Anotherimportant anti-inflammatory activity assay results showedthat compounds 1, 2, and 7 have the potential effect on sup-pression of NF-𝜅B in a concentration-dependent manner inLPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.These similar inhibitions onTNF-𝛼 andNF-𝜅B suggested some close relationship throughEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7Table 2: Screening anti-inflammation targets over molecule docking of compounds 1–5.CompoundnumberMolecules docking resultsTarget name Fit score Norm fit scoreDual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MPKK1) 4.111 0.4567Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 4.010 0.5012Prothrombin 3.843 0.42711/2 Alpha-1-antitrypsin 3.834 0.6390Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta 3.786 0.5409ADAM 17 3.726 0.9315Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK 3.712 0.6187Protein kinase C theta type 3.701 0.5287Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MPKK1) 5.171 0.5745Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase LCK 4.370 0.43703 Glucocorticoid receptor 4.332 0.5415Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta 4.298 0.6140Cathepsin B 4.110 0.4566Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 4.042 0.5053Prothrombin 3.988 0.6646Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MPKK1) 3.660 0.40674 Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase LCK 3.596 0.5137Prothrombin 3.496 0.3885Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase 3.354 0.3727Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MPKK1) 4.246 0.4718Glucocorticoid receptor 3.931 0.4913Estrogen receptor 3.728 0.5325Leukocyte elastase 3.709 0.41215 Protein kinase C theta type 3.689 0.5270Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta 3.642 0.5203Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase LCK 3.626 0.6044Mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 3.596 0.5137Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3.576 0.4470some signal pathway. Previous studies have elucidated somesignal pathways leading to TNF-𝛼 in response to LPS. Inparticular, the activation of NF-𝜅Bmay play a significant rolein LPS-induced expression of TNF-𝛼 [26, 27]. We deducedthat compounds 1, 2, and 7 may inhibit LPS-induced TNF-𝛼 production through inhibition of NF-𝜅B signal pathway;similar conclusion has been reported in triterpenoids anti-inflammatory activity studies [28]. It was reported that theactivation of MPKK1 is in the upstream of NF-𝜅B signalpathway [1]. The computer-aided molecule modeling resultsalso showed compound 1 binding well with MPKK1. Fromthis molecule docking, we further deduced that compounds1 and 2may interact with MPKK1 and consequently suppressthe NF-𝜅B.Some of the seco-cycloartanes have reported to have anti-HIV-1 activity [29] and anti-HBV (hepatitis B virus) activity[30]. The earliest example was nigranoic acid from stems ofSchisandra sphaerandra that has been demonstrated to becapable of inhibiting HIV viral reverse transcriptase withIC50= 74.1𝜇g/mL [31]. Further structure-activation relationexperiment were reported quite recently that cycloartanetriterpenoids with seco structure in ring A shown to inhibitHIV integrase (IN), while cycloartane triterpenoids withoutseco-structure in ring A showed weak or no inhibition at all[32]. The seco-structure seems to be the crucial anti-HIV-1activation related structural feature. Besides, betulinic acidand its derivatives were also extensively reported to have apotent inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiencyvirus type 1 (HIV-1) [33–36]. These reports suggest thatcompounds 1–5 may also possess certain antiviral activ-ity. Molecule docking provided some well-binding targets,including gag-pol polyprotein, protease, androgen receptor8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTable 3: Screening anti-HIV targets over molecule docking of compounds 1–5.Compound number Molecules docking resultsTarget name Fit score Norm fit scoreAndrogen receptor 4.294 0.71571/2 Gag-pol polyprotein 4.281 0.3058Glucocorticoid receptor 4.010 0.5012Renin 3.781 0.5401Androgen receptor 4.768 0.79473 Glucocorticoid receptor 4.332 0.5415Renin 4.121 0.5151Gag-pol polyprotein 3.549 0.22184 Androgen receptor 3.359 0.4199Renin 3.347 0.4183Thymidine kinase 3.337 0.4171Androgen receptor 4.022 0.50285 Glucocorticoid receptor 3.931 0.4913Gag-pol polyprotein 3.674 0.2625Protease 3.556 0.4446and renin.

ConclusionsWe reported the first seco-triterpenoids isolated from thestem barks of I. difengpi. Two new 3,4;9,10-seco-cycloartanetriterpenoids, as well as three known triterpenoids and twobiosynthetic related squalenes were structurally elucidatedthrough spectral methods, together with comparison withliterature.Our study has demonstrated the anti-inflammatoryactivity of these compounds. They showed remarkable anti-inflammatory activity, especially compounds 1, 2, and 7 anddeserve further considerations towards developing as aneffective anti-inflammatory drug. As reported in the previousliteratures, some seco-cycloartane triterpenoids are capableof inhibiting HIV-1. The computer-aided molecule dockingprovided clues for targets screening and further mechanismresearch. Our study suggested that the triterpenoids from I.difengpi are of great interest as potential leads for naturalproduct-based candidates for further studies.Conflict of InterestsThey have not any possible conflict of interests with thetrademarks included in the paper.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Professor Lianna Sun for her helpfulauthentication (Department of Pharmacognosy, School ofPharmacy, Second Medical Military University), ProfessorGenjing Yang for his NMR operating direction (School ofPharmacy, Second Medical Military University), and Fengy-ing Liang (Department of Pharmacy, Changzheng Hospital,Second Medical Military University) and Lina Liao (Depart-ment of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, SecondMedicalMilitary University) for their technical assistance on activitystudy.
