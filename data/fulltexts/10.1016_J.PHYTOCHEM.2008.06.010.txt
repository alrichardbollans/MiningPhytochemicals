Abstract
Hypericum perforatum (Hp) has been used medicinally to treat a variety of conditions including
mild-to-moderate depression. Recently, several anti-inflammatory activities of Hp have been
reported. An ethanol extract of Hp was fractionated with the guidance of an anti-inflammatory
bioassay (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 production (PGE2)), and four
constituents were identified. When combined together at concentrations detected in the Hp fraction
to make a 4 component system, these constituents (0.1 µM chlorogenic acid, 0.08 µM amentoflavone,
0.07 µM quercetin, and 0.03 µM pseudohypericin) explained the majority of the activity of the
fraction when activated by light, but only partially explained the activity of this Hp fraction in dark
conditions. One of the constituents, light-activated pseudohypericin, was necessary, but not sufficient
to explain the reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 of the 4 component system. The Hp fraction and the
4 component system inhibited lipoxygenase and cytosolic phospholipase A2, two enzymes in the
PGE2-mediated inflammatory response. The 4 component system inhibited the production of the
pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the Hp fraction inhibited the anti-
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Thus, the Hp fraction and selected constituents from
this fraction showed evidence of blocking pro-inflammatory mediators but not enhancing
inflammation-suppressing mediators.

5) Introduction
The synthesis of prostaglandins plays a critical role in normal physiological processes as well
as acute and chronic inflammatory states (Dubois et al., 1998; Portanova et al., 1996) and the
key enzymes involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis are prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases,
also known as cyclooxygenases. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is responsible for housekeeping
functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosa (Smith et al., 1996). Cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) is induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce prostaglandins, of which
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is one of the main mediators of inflammation (Minghetti et al.,
1999; O’Sullivan et al., 1992). Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) releases arachidonic acid,
the substrate for COX and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, from membrane phospholipids.
Cytokines mediate the inflammatory response in a complex manner, during its early, middle,
and late stages. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an early pro-inflammatory cytokine, is
involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases and can regulate the growth,
proliferation, and viability of leukocytes (Aggarwal, 2000; Calamia, 2003). Interleukin-10
(IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine predominant in the later phases of inflammation, is a
potent inhibitor of macrophage function, and IL-10 can block the synthesis of TNF-α and can
inhibit COX-2 induction (Niiro et al., 1995; de Waal-Malefyt et al., 1991). Preparations that
can modulate one or many of the mediators of inflammation may be useful for the treatment
of inflammatory diseases.
Hypericum perforatum (Hp) contains unusual compounds such as hypericin, pseudohypericin,
and hyperforin, as well as compounds present throughout the plant kingdom (Bilia et al.,
2002). Raso et al. (2002) found that giving 100 mg/kg of Hp extract by gavage to mice two
times daily significantly reduced COX-2 protein levels in peritoneal macrophages. Hp extracts
and many of the constituents in these extracts (light-activated pseudohypericin, flavonoid
compounds, hyperforin) reduced LPS-induced PGE2 production in RAW 264.7 macrophages
(Hammer et al., 2007). Furthermore, Hp extracts exhibited light-independent reductions in
LPS-induced PGE2, but pseudohypericin significantly decreased LPS-induced PGE2 at 1 and
2 µM only in light-activated conditions and 20 µM hypericin increased PGE2 with and without
LPS only in light-activated conditions. This data established that although individual
constituents like pseudohypericin and hypericin needed activation by light to produce an effect
on PGE2, confirming previously reported light-activated bioactivities of hypericin (Bilia et al.,
2002; Carpenter et al., 1991), Hp extracts did not differ in light-activated and dark conditions,
contrary to previously reported bioactivities (Bilia et al., 2002; Schmitt et al., 2006a; Schmitt
et al., 2006b). Other compounds like the flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives did not differ
in light-activated and dark treatments (Hammer et al., 2007). It is vital to understand the effects
of isolated active constituents as well as combinations of active constituents to relate the
bioactivity of the constituents to the bioactivity of extracts (Spinella, 2002). Of 10 potentially
bioactive constituents tested, only the concentration of pseudohypericin detected in the Hp
extracts (0.2 to 1 µM) was above the level of pure constituent (1 µM) needed to observe a
significant reduction in PGE2 production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages (Hammer et al.,
2007). However, pseudohypericin’s presence in the extracts did not appear to account for the
activity of the extracts, suggesting that the interactions of the constituents may be important
(Hammer et al., 2007).

Bioactivity-guided fractionation was used to identify constituents present in an Hp ethanol
extract that may be responsible for anti-inflammatory activity of the extract. Our hypothesis
was that flavonoid compounds were contributing to the anti-inflammatory activity of the Hp
extracts, along with other constituents that may interact with the flavonoids. To test this
hypothesis, we used a strategy intended to enrich the fractions in flavonoids, and evaluated the
fractions for a reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 production. To compare our anti-inflammatory
results to a known compound, we used concentrations of quercetin exceeding the levels found
in Hp extracts and that have previously been shown to inhibit inflammatory endpoints of
interest as a positive control.
6) Results/Discussion
The bioactivities of Hp fractions from four rounds of iterative fractionations are presented in
Table 1. The original Hp ethanolic extract significantly inhibited LPS-induced PGE2
production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages at both 10 and 20 µg/ml. There was a significant
reduction in cell viability associated with the 20 µg/ml dose of the Hp extract, although the
reduction in PGE2 (46% of PGE2 control) could not be fully explained by this decreased cell
viability data (58% of cell viability control). This original Hp extract was fractionated using
ethanol, chloroform, or hexane into three fractions (1A: ethanol, 1B: hexane, and 1C:
chloroform). The most active fraction from the first round of fractionation at 10 µg/ml was
fraction 1C when compared with other fractions; 36% of the PGE2 production compared to
control and 74% of cell viability compared to control. Subfractionation of fraction 1C by
column chromatography with a solvent series of chloroform (CHCl3), acetonitrile (CH3CN),
and methanol (MeOH) led to 4 fractions (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D), of which, 10 µg/ml of fraction 2C
most significantly decreased PGE2 as compared to control (44% of PGE2 control, 96% of cell
viability control) and was the most active of the second round fractions at 10 µg/ml. Fraction
2C was further sub-fractionated using column chromatography with 1:1 CH3CN:CHCl3 to 1:1
MeOH: CH3CN (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F). Of the third round fractions, fraction 3A significantly
decreased PGE2 (22% of PGE2 control, 85% of cell viability control) at a concentration as low
as 10 µg/ml. Fraction 3A was further sub-fractionated using column chromatography with a
step gradient from 10% CH3CN:CHCl3 to 100% MeOH into 7 fractions (4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E,
4F, 4G). The most active fraction from the last round of fractionation was fraction 4F (58% of
PGE2 control, 101% of cell viability control) at 2 µg/ml; however, the reduction in PGE2 was
not statistically significant.
The concentrations of 10 constituents were quantified in the original Hp extract and the four
most active fractions (1C, 2C, 3A, 4F) are shown in Table 2. The most abundant constituents
in the original Hp extract were hyperforin (12.5 µM), chlorogenic acid (6.1 µM), rutin (2.7
µM), and hyperoside (1.6 µM) (Table 2). After the first round of fractionation, the
concentrations of all the constituents in fraction 1C were at or below 1 µM. It is possible that
agents that suppressed the inhibition of PGE2 production were removed in the earlier stages
of fractionation since the concentration of putative active constituents decreased successively
from the extract to fraction 1C and then to fraction 2C. In addition, unknowns comprised a
larger portion of the later subfractions because the concentration of constituents decreased as
the fractionation progressed, although activity remained about the same and was even greater
from fraction 2C to 3A. The ratios of the 4 putative bioactive constituents in the fraction seemed
to follow the pattern: greatest amount of chlorogenic acid, followed by roughly equal amounts
of quercetin and amentoflavone, and the least amount of pseudohypericin (Table 2 figure
legend). Ratio analysis of the levels of the four constituents in the extract and active fractions
suggested that the greatest activity was obtained when the levels of chlorogenic acid, quercetin,
and amentoflavone were approximately the same and that these concentrations were two to
three times higher than pseudohypericin, as seen with fraction 3A. Additionally, the lowest
activity was seen when only chlorogenic acid and pseudohypericin were detected, as seen with

fraction 4F. Although compounds such as hypericin may have non-reversibly adsorbed to the
silica gel column, results from the PGE2 assay confirmed that at least one fraction was active
from each round as the fractionation progressed. Additionally, flavonoids were compounds of
particular interest in this fractionation and in previous studies, hypericin was shown to increase
PGE2 production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages (Hammer et al., 2007).
Since fraction 3A was significantly active in the PGE2 assay and from the later rounds of
fractionation, experiments were conducted to determine if combining its putative bioactive
constituents (chlorogenic acid, amentoflavone, quercetin, and pseudohypericin) into a 4
component system at the amount detected in fraction 3A could explain the reduction in
PGE2 by fraction 3A. These constituents were also studied together as a 4 component system
at ten times and one hundred times the amount detected in fraction 3A. None of the four
constituents alone reduced PGE2 in light-activated or dark conditions (Table 3). Combinations
of the four constituents revealed that combinations without pseudohypericin were not effective
at reducing PGE2. Two-way and three-way combinations with pseudohypericin seemed to
explain some of the light-activated activity of the Hp fraction, however; not to as great of an
extent as the 4 component system. The combination of all four constituents (34% of PGE2
control, 101% of cell viability control) was sufficient to explain the anti-inflammatory activity
of fraction 3A (12% of PGE2 control, 85% of cell viability control) in light-activated
conditions. Furthermore, this combination of constituents was even more effective at reducing
PGE2 in light-activated than dark conditions. Hyperforin and hypericin were not added to the
4 component system because they were only detected in the fraction and were not able to be
quantified using standard curves of the pure compound. However, later experiments
determined that adding 0.01 µM or 0.001 µM hyperforin to the 4 component system did not
change the reduction in PGE2 associated with the system (data not shown) and hypericin
increased the production of PGE2 and had significant cytotoxicity associated with low doses
in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (Hammer et al., 2007). Thus, the 4 component system
explained the light-activated activity of the Hp fraction but not the dark activity and
pseudohypericin was necessary for the light-activated activity.
Since the four constituents together seemed to best account for the reductions in PGE2 of the
fraction, further explorations compared only the 4 component system with the Hp fraction to
determine if comparable synergy existed in other endpoints. To assess the reduction in PGE2
associated with fraction 3A and the 4 component system, COX-1 and COX-2 protein levels
(Figure 1) and enzyme activities (Figure 2) were examined. LPS-treated groups are shown in
Figure 1 and treatments without LPS are described in the legend for COX-1 and COX-2 protein
levels. No change in COX-1 protein level was detected among treatments without the addition
of LPS and COX-1 protein levels were indistinguishable in the LPS and non-LPS treated
controls. No change in COX-1 protein level was detected with the fractions or 4 component
system when LPS was added (Figures 1a and 1b). COX-2 protein level was increased with the
addition of LPS to the culture media and there was no change in COX-2 protein level when
the treatments were added without LPS (Figure 1). The positive control, 100 µM quercetin,
significantly decreased the LPS-induced COX-2 protein level, as described in the Figure 1
legend. COX-2 protein was reduced when fraction 3A and 100x the 4 component system were
included in light-activated conditions (Figured 1a and 1c), but not in dark treatment conditions
(Figure 1 legend). Fractions 1C and 2C did not reduce LPS-induced COX-2 protein levels in
light-activated conditions (Figures 1a and 1c), further confirming the PGE2 data showing that
fraction 3A was the most anti-inflammatory among the active fractions.
Consistent with the lack of induction of COX-1 protein, no change in COX-1 activity was
detected with fraction 3A or the 4 component system (Figure 2a). In contrast, fraction 3A
significantly decreased COX-2 activity as compared to media + LPS + DMSO control in both
light-activated and dark conditions, whereas the 4 component system significantly decreased

COX-2 activity only in light-activated conditions (Figure 2b). The positive control, 25 µM
quercetin, significantly reduced COX-2 activity (Figure 2b). COX-2 activity was similar
among treatments without LPS (Figure 2b).
To further assess the breadth of anti-inflammatory capabilities of fraction 3A and to compare
the activity of the Hp fraction with the activity of the 4 component system, we examined
cPLA2 activity and lipoxygenase inhibition, as well as TNF-α and IL-10 production in the
RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The positive control, 25 µM quercetin, significantly reduced
LPS-induced cPLA2 and lipoxygenase activity (Figures 3a and 3b). Fraction 3A decreased
LPS-induced cPLA2 activity as compared to the control in both light-activated and dark
conditions, but the 4 component system significantly decreased LPS-induced cPLA2 activity
only in light-activated conditions (Figure 3a). The light-activated 4 component system
displayed similar lipoxygenase inhibitory activity as fraction 3A, and there was no significant
difference between light-activated and dark conditions for either treatment (Figure 3b).
Fraction 3A did not reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α at either 8 or 24 hours, nor
did the 4 component system at 8 hours (Figures 4a and 4b). The 4 component system
significantly reduced TNF-α at 24 hours in the light (Figure 4b). The levels of the anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were reduced by fraction 3A at both 8 and 24 hours in light-
activated and dark conditions (Figure 5a and 5b). Only the light-activated 4 component system
did not significantly inhibit the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at 8 and 24 hours, although
the level of IL-10 was not sustained at the level of the media + LPS + DMSO control. The
complexity of this data suggests that perhaps the 4 component system and fraction 3A affect
prostaglandin biosynthesis pathways in similar ways, but not the production of IL-10 and TNF-
α, two cytokines important in inflammation.
The most intriguing observations from these experiments are that the combination of
chlorogenic acid, amentoflavone, quercetin, and pseudohypericin, at their respective
concentrations in fraction 3A, explained the light-activated inhibition of LPS-induced PGE2
production by fraction 3A and that pseudohypericin was necessary for the activity of 4
component system. However, 1 µM light-activated pure pseudohypericin was required to
significantly reduce PGE2 (Hammer et al., 2007) and pure pseudohypericin at 0.03 µM did not
reduce PGE2. In previous studies, greater than 5 µM quercetin and 10 µM amentoflavone were
required to significantly reduce PGE2, and chlorogenic acid up to 40 µM did not reduce
PGE2 by itself (Hammer et al, 2007). Since one or more of these constituents were needed in
addition to pseudohypericin in combination experiments to effectively reduce PGE2, we
postulated that the synergistic interactions among these constituents were important in the
RAW 264.7 macrophages and that pseudohypericin was necessary, but not sufficient for the
light-activated anti-inflammatory activity. Notably, the 4 component system did not explain
the activity of fraction 3A in the dark.
Synergistic interactions have previously been described for the anti-depressant activities of
constituents present in Hp extracts, although light conditions were not controlled. In the forced
swimming test model of anti-depressant activity, a fraction of procyanidins was not active
alone, but was significantly active when pseudohypericin and hypericin were added
(Butterweck et al., 1998). Interestingly, procyanidins increased the water solubility of hypericin
up to 400 fold (Juergenliemk, 2003a). When the flavonoid rutin, which was inactive in the
forced swimming test alone, was combined with inactive Hp extracts, there was a strong anti-
depressant effect (Noeldner and Schotz, 2002). The present report is perhaps the first
identification of interactions of constituents in Hp necessary for an anti-inflammatory activity
of an Hp extract.
The reduction by Hp of PGE2 and COX-2 protein levels confirms that the eicosanoid pathway
may be an important pathway for the anti-inflammatory activity of Hp. The Hp fraction 3A

and the 4 component system inhibited cPLA2 activity, which could limit the amount of
arachidonic acid available to the COX-2 enzyme. Both the Hp fraction and 4 component system
also inhibited lipoxygenase activity. Limiting arachidonic acid would also limit the availability
of the substrate to the lipoxygenase enzymes. Future studies could explore if products of
lipoxygenases such as lipoxins or leukotrienes are also affected by these treatments.
The light-activated 4 component system reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α at 24
hours and the 4 component system in the dark treatment condition inhibited the anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at both 8 and 24 hours. The Hp fraction inhibited IL-10
production at both time points examined, but not TNF-α production. Since TNF-α would be
produced early in the inflammatory process and perhaps at the same time as PGE2, select
bioactive constituents may act in the early phases of inflammation. Therefore, Hp or select
constituents may decrease pro-inflammatory mediators, but not increase mediators involved
in suppressing inflammation at later stages. Also, the light-activated 4 component system did
not significantly inhibit IL-10, but the IL-10 level was not sustained at the level of the control,
suggesting that the bioactive constituents may impact pro-inflammatory mediators more than
anti-inflammatory mediators. However, the modulation of cytokines and other mediators in
inflammation is complex.
Data on the bioavailability of constituents shown to be responsible for a given bioactivity is
also critical for predicting in vivo effects and the synergistic interactions of the constituents
might be important for bioavailability. Murota et al. (2000) showed that quercetin glucosides
were capable of passing through the Caco-2 epithelial cell monolayer, but their efficiency was
lower than the aglycone quercetin. The bioavailability of pseudohypericin might be increased
by the presence of the flavonoid quercetin and/or biflavonoid amentoflavone, since the oral
bioavailability of hypericin, which has a structure very similar to pseudohypericin, was
increased by 34% with the addition of the flavonoid hyperoside in rats (Butterweck et al.,
2003). Hyperoside increased the water solubility of hypericin by 58% in vitro using the octanol/
water partition coefficient (Juergenliemk, 2003a). Further, a metabolite of orally ingested
quercetin, miquelianin, was able to cross small intestine and central nervous system barriers
in vitro (Juergenliemk et al., 2003b), suggesting that quercetin metabolites might not only
enhance bioavailability of other compounds, but might have considerable bioactivity alone.
Besides increased bioavailability, other plausible explanations to consider are that compounds
from the 4 component system may alter the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
reduce the light-activation of pseudohypericin, or affect electron transport, all processes which
may affect the light-activated cytotoxicity of hypericin or pseudohypericin. Data concerning
these processes are very limited for pseudohypericin, however, the light-activation and
subsequent effects of hypericin have been well documented. There is also data available
concerning other compounds found in Hp. Quercetin has been shown to be a strong singlet
oxygen quencher and have anti-oxidant properties (Tournaire et al., 1993; Korkina and
Afanasev, 1997). Quercetin (10 µM) had a significant protective effect against cytotoxicity of
10 µM hypericin in HL-60 promyelocytic cells, most likely by reducing ROS (Mirossay et al.,
2001). Chlorogenic acid (10 µM) attenuated the cytotoxicity of 20 µM hypericin in HaCat
human keratinocytes (Schmitt et al, 2007b). Couladis et al. (2002) tested an Hypericum
triquetrifolium Turra extract for anti-oxidant activity. Interestingly, four constituents were
identified that were present within the extract; quercetin, rutin, chlorogenic acid, and
amentoflavone, and each constituent possessed anti-oxidant activity. The antioxidant activity
of amentoflavone was similar to the α-tocopherol positive control, whereas the other
constituents possessed less anti-oxidant activity. It is plausible that quercetin, chlorogenic acid,
and amentoflavone may play a role in lessening ROS damage from pseudohypericin. Perhaps
a combination of enhanced bioavailability and other mechanisms like decreased ROS
production or reduced light-activation or electron transfer may aid the synergistic interactions

of constituents to produce a 4 component system with comparable light-activated anti-
inflammatory activity to the Hp fraction.
7) Conclusions and Concluding Remarks
An anti-inflammatory bioactivity-guided fractionation of an Hp extract led to the identification
of four constituents (chlorogenic acid, amentoflavone, quercetin, and pseudohypericin) that in
concert explained the reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 of an Hp subfraction in light-activated
conditions. Pseudohypericin was necessary but not sufficient for the reduction in LPS-induced
PGE2. The data presented here and current literature supports that the Hp fraction exerts effects
on COX-2 and upstream mediators. These data highlight the possibility that unknown and/or
unidentified compounds contribute significantly to the activity of fraction 3A in the dark. These
experiments verify the need for more data on the synergistic interactions of constituents present
in botanical extracts and their interactive roles in bioactivity.
8) Experimental
General Experimental procedures
Cell culture—RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collections (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and cultured as previously described (Hammer et
al., 2007). Treatments for the PGE2 and cell viability assays were performed as previously
described (Hammer et al., 2007). The assays were always performed in both light-activated
and dark conditions, because the naphthodianthrones present within Hp extracts display well-
described light-activated properties. Details on the light-activation and dark treatments were
previously published in Schmitt et al. (2006a).
PGE2 and Cytotoxicity Assays—Samples were assayed with a Prostaglandin E2 EIA kit
(GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or CellTiter96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation
assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) as previously described (Hammer et al., 2007).
COX activity assay—The COX activity assay was used according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Cayman Chemicals; Ann Arbor, MI). The kit measures the peroxidase activity of
cyclooxygenase colorimetrically by addition of arachidonic acid and monitoring the
appearance of oxidized N’, N’, N’, N’-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) at 590 nm.
Quercetin (25 µM) was used as a positive control to demonstrate inhibition of COX-2 activity
because Al-Fayez showed the 50% inhibitory dose of quercetin was 5 µM (Al-Fayez et al.,
2006).
cPLA2 and Lipoxygenase Inhibitory Assays—Cells were plated in petri dishes and
allowed to attach for 24 hours. Cells were treated with or without fraction or constituent and
with or without LPS for 8 hours and further processed as described by the manufacturer.
Activity was measured using the cPLA2 assay kit or the lipoxygenase inhibitor screening assay
kit (both Cayman Chemical Company; Ann Arbor, MI). Quercetin (25 µM) was used as a
positive control to demonstrate inhibition of cPLA2 and lipoxygenase because Lindahl and
Tagesson (1993) showed quercetin less than 100 µM inhibited cPLA2 activity and Deng et al.
(2007) showed that quercetin inhibited 50% of 5-LO and 15-LO at 5.9 and 0.52 µM,
respectively.
TNF-α and IL-10 Assays—Cells were treated as previously described (Hammer et al.,
2007) and supernatants were collected on ice and frozen at −70° C until assayed using a TNF-
α and IL-10 mouse ELISA plate (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) with methods
described by the manufacturer and similar to Senchina et al. (2007). Quercetin (25 µM) was
used as a positive control to demonstrate inhibition of TNF-α and increase in IL-10 because

Comalada et al. (2006) showed that quercetin decreased TNF-α production (50% inhibitory
dose was 20 µM) and 25 quercetin increased IL-10 production in bone marrow-derived
macrophages.
Western Blotting—After an 8 hour treatment, cells were rinsed twice with cold 1X
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-hydrochloride, 2 mM
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 150 mM sodium
chloride, 2 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride, 25 mM leupeptin, 10 mM aprotinin, 10 mM
sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton
X-100) was added to the dishes on ice and the cells were dissociated from the plate by scraping.
The lysate was centrifuged at 4° C, and the supernatant was removed. The protein concentration
in each lysate was determined using the bicinchonic acid and copper sulfate protein assay
(Sigma; St. Louis, MO). Western blot separation and detection was used as previously
described (Przybyszewski et al., 2001). COX-1 and COX-2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) were diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk Tris buffered saline
with 0.5% Tween-20. Semi-quantitative representation was achieved by using the
ImageQuaNT program. Three replicates of each treatment were analyzed on separate blots.
Blots were normalized for consistency by using a repeat control present on each blot. Quercetin
(100 µM) was used as a positive control to demonstrate reduction in COX-2 protein level
because Raso et al. (2002) showed 50 µM quercetin decreased COX-2 protein in J774A.1
macrophages. Quercetin was not shown on the blots to facilitate comparisons among the
graphs, however; the values for quercetin are given in the figure legend.
Compound Identification and Quantification using LC-MS-UV Analysis—An
Agilent Technologies 100 Ion Trap Liquid Chromatography- Electron Spray Ionization-Mass
Spectrometer, with a coupled UV absorption detector (LC-MS-UV) was used for quantification
of compounds, as previously described (Hammer et al., 2007). Specifically, ten compounds
were identified based on the availability of standards and identification in a previous
publication (Hammer et al., 2007). Compounds identified were: chlorogenic acid, rutin,
hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, quercetin, amentoflavone, pseudohypericin, hypericin,
and hyperforin (Juergenliemk and Nahrstedt, 2001; Williams et al., 2006). Each standard was
run on the LC-MS. The peaks from the Hp fractions were confirmed by evaluating the retention
time and mass spectra of each peak with the retention time and mass spectra for the standard
of interest. Stock solutions of each extract or subfraction were: 20 mg/ml for extract, 10 mg/
ml for fraction 1C, 40 mg/ml for fraction 2C, 10 mg/ml for fraction 3A, and 0.7 mg/ml for
fraction 4F.
Statistical Analysis—The COX activity, cPLA2, lipoxygenase, TNF-α, IL-10, and protein
data were logarithmically transformed to eliminate unequal variances and skewed distribution
and an F-protected two-way ANOVA was used followed by a Tukey-Kramer test for multiple
comparisons for all samples (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). The PGE2, cytotoxicity, light
versus dark treatments, and LC-MS-UV data were analyzed as previously described (Hammer
et al., 2007). P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Documentation of plants
One accession of Hp, the commercial variety Common, was provided by the North Central
Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS; Ames, IA). Plant material was harvested in July
2004 from plants cultivated on site and processed as previously described (Schmitt et al.,
2006). Dried Hp plant material (108 grams; aerial parts) was extracted by Soxhlet extraction
for 6 hours with 95% ethanol and yielded 38 grams of dry residue. Two grams of dry residue
was dissolved in 10 mls dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) for the PGE2
screening of the original extract.

For fractionation, the residue from an ethanol extract of Hp (36 g) was dissolved in 10%
aqueous ethanol (1100 mL) and extracted with hexanes (300 mL). After the ethanol solution
was extracted with CHCl3 (500 mL), all three fractions (1A, 1B, 1C) were concentrated in
vacuo. Samples of the resulting residues were tested for activity, and only the CHCl3 fraction
(1C) displayed significant reduction in PGE2.
The residue from fraction 1C (3.1 g) was dissolved in a minimum volume of CHCl3 and further
purified by normal phase column chromatography on silica gel. Silica gel was chosen as a
support for column chromatography to maximize the separation efficiency, even though the
potential for non-reversible adsorption was recognized. Elution with a solvent series consisting
of CHCl3 (375 mL), a 1:1 mixture of CHCl3:CH3CN (475 mL), CH3CN (450 mL), and finally
a 1:1 mixture of CH3CN:MeOH (500 mL) afforded four fractions (2A, 132 mg; 2B, 1.01 mg;
2C, 158 mg; and 2D, 951 mg; respectively) for a total recovery of 73%. After concentration
in vacuo, bioassays of the four fractions identified fraction 2C as the most active and 2C was
further purified by column chromatography on silica gel. A solvent step gradient from 1:1
CH3CN:CHCl3 to 1:1 MeOH:CH3CN afforded 6 fractions, (3A, 1:1 CH3CN:CHCl3, 70 mL,
35.4 mg; 3B, 1:1 CH3CN:CHCl3, 70 mL, 61.5 mg; 3C, 1.5:1 CH3CN:CHCl3, 135 mL, 16.1
mg; 3D, 3:1 CH3CN:CHCl3, 100 mL, then 100% CH3CN, 100 mL, 5.2 mg; 3E, 1:9
MeOH:CH3CN, 100 mL, then 1:5 MeOH:CH3CN, 100 mL, 21.6 mg; and finally 3F, 1:1
MeOH:CH3CN, 100 mL, 7.7 mg, respectively, representing 99% recovery). The fraction that
displayed the most significant activity, fraction 3A, was finally purified by column
chromatography on silica gel. This fraction (34 mg) was placed on a column of silica gel (0.5
by 14 cm) and eluted with a step gradient from 10% CH3CN:CHCl3 to 100% MeOH to give
the final 7 fractions 4A–G (4A, 1:9 CH3CN:CHCl3, 100 mL, 6.2 mg; 4B, 1:9
CH3CN:CHCl3, 75 mL, 8.7 mg; 4C, 1:3 CH3CN:CHCl3, 75 mL, 12.6 mg; 4D, 1:1
CH3CN:CHCl3, 75 mL, then 3:1 CH3CN:CHCl3, 75 mL, 4.9 mg; 4E, 1:5 CH3CN:CHCl3, 20
mL, 3.8 mg; 4F, 1:5 MeOH:CH3CN, 50 mL, 1.4 mg; and 4G, 100% MeOH, 100 mL, 3.4 mg).
Endotoxin levels of the extracts were assayed as previously described (Hammer et al., 2007)
to confirm that endotoxin present in the extracts did not affect PGE2 levels. The range of
endotoxin levels present was 0.000003 to 0.0001 endotoxin units/milliliter (EU/ml). Endotoxin
up to 5 EU/ml did not significantly increase the RAW 264.7 cells’ production of PGE2 in the
assay (Hammer et al., 2007).

Reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 and cell viability of Hp fractions and subfractions in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages.
Mean percent of LPS-induced PGE2 level as compared to media + LPS + DMSO control (95% confidence intervals)
and mean percent of cell viability as compared to media + DMSO control-treated cells ± standard error of Hp fractions
n=8 for treatments. PGE2 and cell viability data represents light-activated and dark treatments combined as there was
no significant difference between the treatments. The concentration of 10 µg/ml was chosen to compare fractions from
each round of fractionation; fractions from rounds 3 and 4 were assayed at the highest concentration possible based on
the amount of DMSO that can be added onto the cells. Fractions in the culture media without LPS did not significantly
affect the concentration of PGE2 as compared to the media + DMSO control. Addition of LPS to the culture media +
DMSO control increased the level of PGE2 20–38 fold over media + DMSO control alone (0.1 ±0.05 ng/ml for media
+ DMSO, 2.7 ± 0.5 ng/ml for media + DMSO + LPS). Quercetin (10 µM) positive control significantly inhibited
PGE2 production (11(8–16) % of PGE2 control)

Table 3
Reduction in PGE2 and cell viability by combinations of the putative bioactive constituents identified in Fraction 3A.
Mean percent of LPS-induced PGE2 level as compared to media + LPS + DMSO control (95% confidence intervals)
and mean percent of cell viability as compared to media + DMSO control-treated cells ± standard error of constituents
identified in fraction 3A. n=8 for anti-inflammatory treatments; n=8 for cytotoxicity treatments. Q=0.07 µM quercetin,
A= 0.08 µM amentoflavone, CA= 0.2 µM chlorogenic acid, PH= 0.03 µM pseudohypericin. Cytotoxicity data
represents light-activated and dark treatments combined as there was no difference between light-activated versus dark
treatments. Constituents in the culture media without LPS did not affect the concentration of PGE2 as compared to the
media + DMSO control. Addition of LPS to the culture media + DMSO control increased the level of PGE2 10–34
fold over the media + DMSO control alone (0.07 ±0.03 ng/ml for media + DMSO, 1.6 ± 0.4 ng/ml for media + DMSO
+ LPS). Quercetin (10 µM) positive control significantly inhibited PGE2 production (11 (8–16) % of control)
