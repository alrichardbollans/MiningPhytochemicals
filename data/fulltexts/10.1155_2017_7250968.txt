However, data on the mechanism of torilin action against inflammation is limited.This study aimed at determining theanti-inflammatory property of torilin in LPS-induced inflammation using in vitro model of inflammation. We examined torilin’seffect on expression levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The involvementof NF-kB and AP-1, MAP kinases, and adaptor proteins were assessed. Torilin strongly inhibited LPS-induced NO release, iNOS,PGE2, COX-2, NF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽, IL-6, and GM-CSF gene and protein expressions. In addition, MAPKs were also suppressed by torilinpretreatment. Involvement of ERK1/2, P38MAPK, and JNK1/2 was further confirmed by PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125mediatedsuppression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins. Furthermore, torilin attenuated NF-kB and AP-1 translocation, DNA binding, andreporter gene transcription. Interestingly, torilin inhibited TAK1 kinase activation with the subsequent suppression of MAPK-mediated JNK, p38, ERK1/2, and AP-1 (ATF-2 and c-jun) activation and IKK-mediated I-𝜅B𝛼 degradation, p65/p50 activation, andtranslocation. Together, the results revealed the suppression of NF-𝜅B and AP-1 regulated inflammatory mediator and cytokineexpressions, suggesting the test compound’s potential as a candidate anti-inflammatory agent.1. IntroductionThe study of such inflammatory responses including inflam-matory mediators and cytokines activation is best charac-terized using suitable macrophage cell-lines including RAW264.7 cells as models. In macrophages, LPS activates Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and the activated receptor recruitsthe adaptor proteins (e.g., MyD88 or TRAM) and initi-ates MyD88 dependent or independent signaling pathways.MyD88 recruits and associates with two IL-1R-associatedkinases (IRAK4 and IRAK1) leading to TNF receptor asso-ciated factor-6 (TRAF6) activation [1]. The activated TRAF6is then ubiquitinated and recruited to the TGF𝛽-activatedkinase 1 (TAK1)-TGF𝛽-activated kinase-1 binding protein1 and 2 (TAB1/2) complex via binding to TAB2 [2]. Thispromotes the activation of TAK1, which in turn activates thecanonicalNF-𝜅B [2] and theMAPkinases signaling pathways[3]. TAK1-TAB1/2 complex is thus a common route for the I𝜅Bkinase (IKK) and for MAPKs pathways (ERK1/2, JNK, andp38) [4]. These signaling pathways in turn activate a varietyof transcription factors including NF-kB (p50/p65) and AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) that coordinate the induction of many genesencoding inflammatory mediators [5]. These mediators suchas iNOS, COX-2, and cytokines (TNF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽, IL-6, andGM-CSF) are the common inflammatory mediators tran-scriptionally regulated by the above indicated transcriptionfactors [6]. Therefore, targeting these transcription factors,adaptor proteins, protein kinases, inflammationmediators, orHindawiMediators of InﬂammationVolume 2017, Article ID 7250968, 13 pageshttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/72509682 Mediators of Inflammationcytokines themselves by natural products or their derivativescan be an effective strategy for immunosuppression [7].Natural products are reported to be better candidatesof therapeutics due to their chemical diversity, structuralcomplexity, affordability, lack of substantial toxicity, andinherent biologic activities [8]. Salminen et al. further indi-cated that a number of natural products have demonstratedNF-𝜅B-inhibitory activities such as attenuation of IKK acti-vation, I𝜅B degradation, NF-𝜅B nuclear translocation, andDNA binding [9]. A large body of evidences also indicatedanti-inflammatory effects of natural products against MAPkinases. Modulation of NF-𝜅B and MAP kinases signalingpathways is therefore a principal target to alleviate inflam-matory diseases including arthritis [10]. Recently, however,the demand for anti-inflammatory agents that can treatinflammation and arthritis but remain relatively free of sideeffects in long term treatment increases.A large number of plant-derived compounds includingnatural terpenoids as powerful inhibitors of NF-kB andMAPkinases are reported to be suppressive agents of inflammationand cancer [9, 11]. Evidently, a number of terpenoids arereported to affect some upstream targets as they inhibitthe NF-kB and MAPK pathways simultaneously and fur-ther potentiate the suppression of inflammatory responses[9, 12]. Sesquiterpenes are most widely published class ofnatural products cited as inhibitors of NF-𝜅B. For instance,parthenolide, a sesquiterpenes, is reported to inhibit NF-𝜅B via inhibition of I𝜅B𝛼/I𝜅B𝛽 degradation [13] and IKK𝛽activation [14] and modification of NF-𝜅B via alkylation[15–17]. However, information on the mechanism of anti-inflammatory property of torilin, another sesquiterpene, islimited.Torilin (11-acetoxy-8-angeloyl-4-guaien-3-one), a guai-ane-type sesquiterpene angelate, is isolated from the fruitsof the plant Torilis japonica [18]. Previous studies on torilinindicated that the compound exhibits antiprotozoal [19] andantimicrobial [20] effects. Besides, it is reported to reversemultidrug-resistance [21] and show antiangiogenic as well asanti-invasive properties [22, 23].Although few reports have been documented on the anti-inflammatory potential of torilin [24, 25], studies detailingthe mechanism of action behind its anti-inflammatory effectusing macrophage cells line (suitable models for studyinginflammatory responses) are limited. Since torilin has beenshown to possess anti-inflammatory activities in vitro andin vivo [24, 25], we previously have reported that torilinmodifies inflammatory cell and cytokine imbalances with theattenuation of the severity of arthritis in mouse model ofrheumatoid arthritis [26]. However, itsmolecularmechanismof action against inflammatory responses has not beenreported yet. The aim of this study was therefore to examinethe upstream events in the anti-inflammatory property oftorilin and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action.Here, we report that torilin markedly inhibited inflammatorymediators and cytokines via inhibition of TAK1-mediatedMAPK, AP-1, and NF-kB activation.2.

Torilin (98%) was prepared as previously indicated in[26] and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and freshly dilutedin culture media for all experiments.2.1. Cell Culture. RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, obtainedfrom theAmerican cell collection (ATCCTIB71), were growninDulbecco’smodifiedEagle’smedium (DMEM) (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,2mM L-glutamine, 100UmL−1 penicillin, and 100 𝜇gmL−1streptomycin. They were incubated under endotoxin-freeconditions at 37∘C in a 5% CO2humidified air incubator.2.2. Cell Viability. The RAW 264.7 cells were plated at a den-sity of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate for 24 h. To deter-mine any potential cytotoxic effect of the test compound,cells were treated with torilin or vehicle before incubationfor 48 h.

RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription PCR. Totalcellular RNA from 3 × 106 RAW 264.7 macrophages treatedwith torilin or vehicle was extracted as described previously[27] using Easy Blue kits (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea)according to the manufacturer’s instructions and storedat −70∘C until use. Briefly, 1 𝜇g RNA was annealed withpoly(dT)18for 10min at 70∘C and cooled for 5min on ice,reverse transcribed using reverse transcription (RT) premix(Bioneer) in 20 𝜇l of reaction mixture containing 5x buffer(10mM dNTP, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, and 2U of murineleukemia virus reverse transcriptase), and run for 90min at42.5∘C using a thermal cycler. The reactions were terminatedat 95∘C for 5min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. Thereverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)was performed using aliquots of cDNA obtained from RTreaction in a PCR premix (Bioneer) containing a 10x buffer[10mM Tris⋅HCl (pH 8.3), 50mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100,0.25mM dNTP, 25mM MgCl2, and 1 U of Taq polymerase].Amplification conditions were 5min before denaturation at95∘C followed by 30–35 cycles consisting of denaturationat 95∘C, annealing at 55–60∘C, and elongation at 72∘C for45 second each with final extension for 10min at 72∘C.The PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.3% agarose gelstained with ethidium bromide and visualized using EagleEyes image analysis software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Theintensity of band densities for iNOS, COX-2, TNF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽,IL-6, and GM-CSFmRNA expression levels were normalizedfor the corresponding GAPDH and ratios were compared.The sequence of oligonucleotides used was as follows: iNOS:(forward-5󸀠-GTG CTG CCT CTG GTC TTG CAA GC-3󸀠,reverse-5󸀠-AGG GGC AGG CTG GGA ATT CG-3󸀠); COX-2:(forward-5󸀠-TCT CAGCACCCACCCGCTCA-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-TCT CAG CAC CCA CCC GCT CA-3󸀠); IL-1𝛽: (forward-5󸀠-TGC TTC CAA ACC TTT GAC CTG GGC-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-CAG GGT GGG TGT GCC GTC TTT C-3󸀠); TNF-𝛼:(forward-5󸀠-CCTGTAGCCCACGTCGTAGC-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-TTG ACC TCA GCG CTG AGT TG-3󸀠); IL-6: (forward-5󸀠-GCT GGA GTC ACA GAA GGA GTG GC-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-GGC ATA ACG CAC TAG GTT TGC CG-3󸀠); GM-CSF:(forward-5󸀠-ACT CTG CTC ACG AAG GAA CTC AGC-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-CAC AGC TCG GAA GAG CAT CGC A-3󸀠);GAPDH: (forward-5󸀠-CAC TCACGGCAAATTCAACGGC-3󸀠, reverse-5󸀠-CCT TGG CAG CAC CAG TGG ATG CAGG-3󸀠).2.6. Immunoblotting. RAW 264.7 macrophages were washedwith PBS and lysed in standard lysis buffer [20mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 137mMNaCl, 10% glycerol, 2mMEDTA, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 25mM 𝛽-glycero-phosphate, 2mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride and 1mgmL−1 leupeptin, 2mgmL−1aprotinin, and 1mgmL−1 pepstatin A]. Lysates were cen-trifuged at 10,000×g for 10min and supernatant was storedat −70∘C until use. Protein was then measured usingBicinchoninic Acid (BCA, Pierce, USA) protein assay kitwith bovine serum albumin used as a standard. Equalamounts of protein (30–40𝜇g/lane) were loaded with samplebuffer (250mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5M DTT, 10% SDS,50% glycerol, 5%𝛽-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% bromophenolblue) and electrophoresed on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gelunder standard conditions and electroblotted to polyvinyli-dene difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore Co., MA,USA) in 20% methanol transfer buffer. The membraneswere washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing0.01% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and blocked with 5% nonfat milk,washed, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted(1 : 1000) overnight at 4∘C. The membranes were then incu-batedwith secondary antibodies conjugatedwith horseradishperoxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Scanning densito-metry of the immunoblots was performed with an ImageScan and Analysis System (Alpha-Innotech, San Leandro,CA, USA). The area of each lane was integrated using thesoftware Alpha Ease version 5.5 (Alpha-Innotech) followedby background subtraction.2.7. Immunoprecipitation and In Vitro TAK1 Kinase Assays.Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (500 𝜇g)from RAW 264.7 (107 cells/ml) treated with torilin or vehicle30min before LPS stimulation for 15min were preclearedwith 10 𝜇L proteinA-coupled Sepharosemagnetic beads (10%v/v; ELPIS Biotech, Korea) for 1 h at 4∘C. Precleared sampleswere incubated with 3 𝜇L anti-TAK1 antibody overnight at4∘C. Immune complexes were mixed with 10 𝜇L protein A-coupled Sepharose magnetic beads (10% v/v) and incubatedfor 4 h at 4∘C. The immune-precipitates were then washed5 times with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 2mM EDTA, 2mM EGTA, 50mM 𝛽-glycero-phosphate, 5mM NaF, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1%Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10𝜇g/ml aprotinin, 10 𝜇g/mlpepstatin, 1mMPMSF, 1mMbenzimide, and 2mMhydrogenperoxide). After washing, the beads were boiled in Laemmlisample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1%𝛽-mercaptoethanol, 0.008% bromophenol blue, 80mMTris pH6.8, and 1mM EDTA) and the proteins were resolved bySDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked,and probed with anti-p-TAK1, TAK1, p-IKK𝛼/𝛽, IKK, p-MKK4, MKK4, anti-TLR4, and 𝛽-actin antibodies. Then,immunoblots were visualized as indicated above.For evaluating TAK1 kinase activities following immuno-precipitation, the beads were washed in IP buffer and then inkinase reaction buffer [100mMTris-HCl, pH 7.2; 125mMMg(C2H3O2)2; 25mM MnCl2; 2mM EGTA; 0.25mM sodiumorthovanadate; and 2mM DTT] and then resuspended inkinase buffer containing 1 𝜇mATP and 12.5 𝜇Ci of 𝛾−32. After5min of incubation at 30∘C, the reaction was terminated bylysis buffer.2.8. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts. Prior to nuclear extrac-tion, cells (5 × 106/well) were washed twice with ice-coldPBS centrifuged and the pellet was suspended by adding400 𝜇l of buffer A [10mMHEPES (pH 7.9), 10mMKCl, 2mMMgCl2, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM dithiothreitol and 0.5mM4 Mediators of Inflammationphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 𝜇gmL−1 of leu-peptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin]. After centrifugation at10,000×g for 5min, pellet was resuspended with buffer Aand 5% Nonidet-P40 and centrifuged at 13,000×g for 2minand the supernatant was used as cytosolic extract. The pelletscontaining crude nuclei were resuspended in 400 𝜇l bufferA centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5min twice. The pellets wereagain resuspended with buffer B containing 10mM HEPES[(pH 7.9), 300mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT and1mM PMSF, 5 𝜇gmL−1 leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatineach and 10% glycerol] and incubatedwith rocking for 20minon ice. The samples were centrifuged at 15,800×g for 10minto obtain the supernatant containing nuclear extracts. Proteinconcentration of the supernatant was determined.2.9. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. RAW 264.7 macro-phages (3 × 106 cells) were treated with torilin or vehicleand stimulated with LPS for 45min, washed, scraped into0.5ml cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cytosolicand nuclear protein fractions were extracted using activemotif nuclear extraction kit (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Bindingreactions were performed at 37∘C for 15min in 20𝜇l ofreaction buffer containing [10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50mMNaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 𝜇g poly(dI-dC), 1mMdithiothreitol, and 30,000 cpm 32P-labeled oligonucleotideprobes] for NF-𝜅B and AP-1. DNA-protein complexes wereseparated from unbound DNA probe on native 6% polyacry-lamide gels at 75V in 0.5x TBE buffer and then transferred tonylon membrane.2.10. Transient Transfection Luciferase Assay. Transient trans-fections of RAW 264.7 cells with MyD88, NF-𝜅B, and AP-1 promoter firefly luciferase construct were performed intriplicate in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invit-rogen, CA, USA). The reporter activity was measured usinga luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’sinstructions. Briefly, 6 hr after treatment, cells were washedtwice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed by adding 200𝜇lof 1x reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After centrifugation at12,000×g for 10min at 4∘C, the supernatant was analyzed forluciferase activity and normalized to 𝛽-galactosidase activity.2.11. Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed by one-wayanalysis of variancewithDunnett’s post hoc test. Experimentsrepresent at least 4 independent replications in triplicate.Values are means ± SE and treatment groups were comparedby t-test. 𝑃 < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Result3.1. Torilin Inhibits LPS-Induced Inflammatory Mediator andCytokine Expressions. Because torilin has been described assesquiterpene with anti-inflammatory activity in BV2 cells[25], we examined the anti-inflammatory mechanisms ofthe compound using a suitable macrophage RAW 264.7cell-line model. Toxicity screening showed that torilin didnot exhibit cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 (SupplementaryFigure 1 in Supplementary Material available online athttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/7250968). Torilin pretreatmentdose-dependently inhibitedNOgeneration and iNOSproteinand gene expressions (Figures 1(a), 1(c), and 1(d)), respec-tively. In addition, prostaglandin (PG)E2 and COX-2 proteinand mRNA expressions were markedly suppressed by torilin(Figures 1(b), 1(e), and 1(f)). Torilin further arrested LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽,IL-6, and GM-CSF protein secretion (Figures 2(a)–2(d)) andprotein and mRNA expressions (Supplementary Figure 2A-F), respectively.These data suggested that torilinmay elicit itsoverall anti-inflammatory effects at the level and/or upstreamof inflammatory gene transcriptions.3.2. Effect of Torilin on LPS-Induced MAP Kinases and PI3k-Akt Activation. We examined the possible involvement ofMAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in torilin mediatedinhibition of inflammatory mediators. As shown in Figures3(a) and 3(b), torilin significantly suppressed LPS-inducedERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 activation in a dose dependentmanner while it had no effect on PI3k/Akt phosphorylation(Supplementary Figure 3). This observation was furtherconfirmed by the suppressive effects of the respective MAPkinases inhibitors PD98059 (ERK-inhibitor), SB203580 (p38-inhibitor), and SP600125 (JNK-inhibitor) on iNOS andCOX-2 expressions (Figure 3(c)). The result suggests that theanti-inflammatory effect of torilin is correlated with MAPKinactivation.3.3. Torilin Inhibited I-𝜅B Phosphorylation and NF-𝜅B Acti-vation. To further investigate the molecular mechanisminvolved in the torilin mediated inhibitions of inflammatorymediator and cytokine transcriptions observed in this study,we examinedwhetherNF-𝜅B and/orAP-1 signaling pathwaysare involved. As shown in Figure 4(a), LPS stimulationmarkedly triggered I-kB𝛼 phosphorylation with a concurrentdecrease in total I-kB expression especially at 15 and 30minLPS stimulation. Torilin pretreatment strongly and time-dependently inhibited I-kB𝛼 phosphorylation and restoredtotal I-kB depletion (Figure 4(a)). Since phosphorylation ofI-kB𝛼 precedes degradation of I-kB𝛼 and subsequent releaseof NF-𝜅B, we also examined the effect of torilin treatment onNF-𝜅B activation and translocation.3.4. Torilin Inhibits NF-𝜅B and AP-1 Nuclear Translocation,DNA Binding, and Reporter Activities. Since, without enter-ing the nucleus, NF-𝜅B cannot regulate transcription, weinvestigated effect of torilin treatment on LPS-induced NF-𝜅B translocation, DNA binding, and reporter gene activity.The p65 and p50 nuclear translocation was analyzed fromcytosolic and nuclear protein fractions at a given time inter-val. Torilin significantly reduced LPS-induced cytosolic p65and p50 expressions (Figure 4(b)). The nuclear translocationof NF-𝜅B was markedly observed from an increased LPS-induced p65 and p50 nuclear protein expression levels thatwere significantly inhibited by torilin treatment (Figure 4(c)).In addition to NF-𝜅B activation (Supplementary Figure 4),immunoblotting revealed that LPS-induced AP-1 subunit(ATF-2 and c-jun but not c-fos) activation was also inhibitedby torilin treatment (Supplementary Figure 5).Mediators of Inflammation 5Nitrite (𝜇M)35302520151050∗∗∗∗∗∗LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 6.25 502512.5−−(a)LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 502512.5−−∗∗∗∗∗∗∗PGE2production (pgmL−1)25002000150010005000(b)iNOS𝛽-ActiniNOS/𝛽-actin protein∗∗∗∗∗∗6.25 2512.5LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) − −1.00.80.60.40.20.0(c)GAPDHiNOS/GAPDH mRNA iNOS∗∗∗∗∗∗3.13 2512.56.25LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) − −10.80.60.40.20(d)𝛽-ActinCOX-2COX-2/𝛽-actin protein1.41.21.00.80.60.40.20.06.25 2512.5LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) − −∗∗∗∗∗∗(e)GAPDHCOX-2COX-2/GAPDH mRNA 3.13 2512.56.25LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) − −0.60.40.20∗∗∗∗∗∗(f)Figure 1: Torilin inhibits LPS-induced NO release, PGE2 secretion, and protein as well as mRNA expression of iNOS and COX-2 enzymes.RAW246.7macrophages were pretreatedwith torilin or vehicle for 30min and stimulatedwith LPS for 18 or 24 h.

To further investigate whether torilinattenuates promoter activities of the indicated transcriptionfactors, we tested luciferase reporter gene transcription.Incubation of transfected RAW 264.7 cells with LPS for 6 h6 Mediators of InflammationLPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 6.25 2512.5−−TNF-𝛼secretion (pgmL−1) 6000500040003000200010000∗∗(a)LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 6.25 2512.5−−IL-1𝛽secretion (pgmL−1) 14000120001000080006000400020000∗∗(b)LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 6.25 2512.5−−IL-6 secretion (pgmL−1)1400012000100008000600040002000016000∗∗∗(c)LPS (100ngmL−1)Torilin (𝜇M) 6.25 2512.5−−GM-CSF (pgmL−1)6000500040003000200010000∗∗∗∗∗∗(d)Figure 2: Torilin pretreatment reduces LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretions into the culture media.

However, the increased NF-𝜅Band AP-1 reporter gene activities were suppressed in torilin-sensitive manner (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)), suggesting that thecompound’s inhibitory effect is associated with reduced NF-kB- and AP-1-DNA binding and promoter activities.3.5. Torilin Suppressed I𝜅B Kinase-𝛼/𝛽 (IKK𝛼/𝛽) Activation.Since activation of NF-𝜅B is induced by a cascade of signalingevents leading to the activation of IKK complex, which inturn phosphorylates I𝜅B [28, 29], we determined torilininfluence on LPS-induced IKK𝛼/𝛽 activation. In parallel withits inhibition on LPS-induced phosphorylation and I𝜅B𝛼degradation (Figure 4(a)), torilin suppressed IKK𝛼/𝛽 activa-tion at the indicated time course (Figure 6(a)), suggestingthat LPS-induced kinase activity may be impaired by thetest compound that ultimately leads to an inhibition inIKK-mediated I𝜅B𝛼 phosphorylation and NF-𝜅B regulatedinflammatory response. However, it is worth noticing thatNF-𝜅B is not the only pathway that could be modified bytorilin because phosphorylation of IKK𝛼/𝛽 is also regulatedby other upstream factors such as MAPKs, including ERK,JNK, and p38. We, indeed, affirmed that torilin markedlysuppressed the upregulation of these kinases after LPSstimulation (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), suggesting that torilinaffects some upstream targets as they inhibit the NF-kB andMAPK pathways simultaneously and further potentiate thesuppression of inflammatory responses.3.6. Torilin Inhibits LPS-Induced TAK1 Activation and Mul-tiple Components of Downstream Signaling Pathway. Sinceour data showed that torilin affects both IKK𝛼/𝛽 and MAPKdownstream pathways, we thought that its inhibitory effectmight involve upstream common pathway that lies betweenTLR4 andMAP3K complexes. Interestingly, immunoblottinganalysis revealed that while torilin did not affect LPS-stimulated activation of MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6 (datanot shown), it markedly inhibited TAK1, MKK4, and IKK𝛼/𝛽activation (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). Since Shim et al. foundthat TNFR1, IL-1R, TLR3, and TLR4-mediated NF-𝜅B andAP-1 activation are severely impaired in TAK1 deficient cells,but not in TAK1-binding protein 1 and 2 (TAB1/2) deficientcells [30], and since torilin did not affect MyD88, IRAK1, andTRAF6 downstream of TLR4 but suppressed the signalingeffects thereafter we further examined the test compound’seffect at the level of MAP3K complexes. TAK1 was immuno-precipitated from LPS-stimulated untreated cells and fromcells treated with torilin, as indicated in Figure 6(d). Theimmunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE, and themembrane was blotted with an antibody that recognizes p-TAK1, TAK1, p-MKK4, MKK4, p-IKK𝛼/𝛽, and IKK 𝛼/𝛽.TAK1 precipitation increased LPS-induced p-TAK1 activationand brought down the basal TAK1 protein expression, theevent of which was reversed by torilin treatment (Fig-ure 6(d)).

DiscussionThe promotion of inflammatory conditions and the initi-ation of the innate immune response require the releaseof many special effector proteins, the synthesis of which istranscriptionally regulated by inducible transcription factorsthat bind to the promoter regions of their respective genes.Such effectors (mediators of inflammation) include iNOS,COX-2, and cytokines (TNF-𝛼, IL-1, IL-6, andGM-CSF).NF-𝜅B and AP1 are among the principal inducible transcriptionfactors that play pivotal roles in innate immune response [31]and chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoidarthritis [32]. Recently, the demand for natural productslimiting induction of inflammatory mediators with minimalside effects is growing.For decades, numerous studies have been reported tosupport the promise that natural products and phytochem-icals could be protective against the risk of various types ofinflammation and a large body of evidence indicated the anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds in terms of theiraction against kinases, adaptor proteins, the transcriptionfactors, such as NF-𝜅B and AP-1, and the genes regulated bysuch transcription factors [8, 9, 11, 33].Sesquiterpenes, plant-derived compounds, are reportedto modulate NF-𝜅B and AP-1 transduction pathways andinhibit inflammatory mediators and inflammatory processesthat help alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory diseasesincluding arthritis [9, 11].

We, herefurther, report the in vitro inhibitory effect of torilin inLPS-inducible inflammatory mediators and proinflamma-tory cytokines and propose the underlying mechanism ofaction in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The mediatorsof inflammation protein secretion and mRNA expressionsrevealed that torilin effectively blocked the LPS-stimulatedNO generation, PGE2 synthesis, and iNOS and COX-2protein and mRNA expressions, respectively. In addition,LPS-activated TNF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽, IL-6, and GM-CSF proteinsecretions and gene expressions are markedly inhibited bytorilin treatment, suggesting that the test compound’s wide-spectrum effect on inflammatory mediators might arise fromits influence on the upstream common signaling pathway.This study examined the involvement of MAPKs as amolecular target for torilin mediated inhibition of LPS-indu-ced inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cyto-kine inductions. All the three MAPKs, that is, ERK1/2,p38MAPK and JNK1/2, were markedly suppressed by torilinpretreatment.Using the selectiveMAPK inhibitors, PD98059,SB203580, and SP600125, we further confirmed that block-ade of the indicated MAPK activities by their respectiveinhibitors suppressed iNOS and COX-2 expressions. More-over, torilin arrested AP1 transactivation and its subunits(ATF2, c-jun, and c-fos) phosphorylation. This observationsuggests that the inhibitory effect of torilin on iNOS andCOX-2 induction was at least partly regulated via MAPKsmediated AP1 transactivation. In agreement with our data,several lines of evidence documented the essential roles ofMAPKs in regulating LPS-induced inflammatory responses.MAPK cascades mediate LPS-stimulated induction of COX-2 and IL-1𝛽 in RAW264 macrophages [34]. Likewise, ERKand p38 subgroups of MAPKs regulate iNOS and TNF-𝛼 gene expressions in endotoxin-stimulated glial cells [35],and p38MAPK also plays role in IL-1𝛽 transcription [36].Hwang et al. have reported blockade of ERK1/2 and p38MAPKactivities by PD98059 and SB203580, respectively, resulting inpartial suppression of LPS-induced COX-2 expression [37],and monocytes treated with LPS in the presence of MEKinhibitor U0126 failed to release cytokines and PGE2 [38],supporting the notion that the MAPK pathway is criticalfor inflammatory response and torilin with the inhibitory10 Mediators of InflammationP-IKK𝛼/𝛽IKKIKK𝛼/𝛽𝛽-ActinLPS (𝜇g/ml) 301550− − + − + − +− − + − + − +− + + + + + +Time (min)6030150IKK activation∗∗∗∗∗∗LPS (0.1𝜇gmL−1)Torilin (25𝜇M)Torilin (25𝜇M)1.61.41.21.00.80.60.40.20.0Phospho-IKK𝛽(a)𝛽-ActinMKK4P-MKK4TAK1P-TAK1min60301550− − + − + − + − +g/ml)LPS (1 𝜇Torilin (25𝜇M)(b)0 6.25 12.5TAK1 kinase activity (%)+ + +Torilin (𝜇M)g/ml)LPS (1 𝜇∗100806040200(c)IB: P-TAK1IB: TAK1IB: P-MKK4IB: P-IKK𝛼/𝛽IB: MKK4IB: IKKIB: 𝛽-actin− + +− − +IP: TAK115 ming/ml)LPS (1 𝜇Torilin (25𝜇M)(d)Figure 6: Torilin suppresses LPS-induced IKK and MAP3K complex activation and inhibits the TAK1 interaction with the components ofMAPK and NF-𝜅B signaling pathways.

Theauthors reported that torilin inhibits iNOS, COX-2, PGE2,and IL-1𝛽 activation and they suggested that torilin mediatedinhibition of ERK or p38 but not JNK activation is one ofthe possible mechanisms underlying its inhibitory action oniNOS expression and NO production [25]. The discrepancyon JNK activation between the reported study and the presentinvestigation may be due to the difference in cells used in therespective studies. In line with this, negative regulation of p38and IKK activation by TGF-𝛽-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) wasobserved in a cell type-specific manner [39]. However, torilinaction against a wide range of LPS-induced inflammatorymediators, MAPKs, and transcription factors suggests thatupstream pathway early signaling event may be affected.Since a critical step in LPS-induced NF-𝜅B nuclearaccumulation and transcriptional activity is p65 and p50dissociation from I𝜅B protein, this study investigated effectof torilin treatment in I𝜅B and its kinase activity. Interest-ingly, we found that torilin inhibited LPS-induced IKK𝛼/𝛽activation, IkB𝛼 phosphorylation, and decreased p65 andp50 nuclear translocation. In line with our findings, othersesquiterpenes have been shown to inhibit activation of NF-𝜅B by preventing the degradation of I-𝜅B-𝛼 and I-𝜅B-𝛽 [13],inhibiting NF-𝜅B activation [40], and suppressing iNOS andCOX-2 expression through the inactivation of NF-kB [41] orby directly binding to and inhibiting I-𝜅B kinase [14, 15].We, in the present study, observed that torilin pre-treatment suppressed MAPK and IKK mediated I-𝜅B phos-phorylation, NF-𝜅B and AP1 nuclear translocation, DNAbinding, and reporter transcriptional activation reflectingthe ability of torilin to inhibit NF- 𝜅B and AP-1 dependentinflammatorymediators and proinflammatory cytokine tran-scriptions. Such a strong effect of torilin on both IKK andMAPK activation in the present study suggests its role onearly common upstream signaling events. However, torilindid not affect MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6 downstream ofTLR4 but suppressed the signaling effects thereafter at thelevel of MAP3K complexes. Interestingly, torilin inhibitedTAK1 kinase activation and phosphorylationwith subsequentTAK1 mediated activation of kinases such as the I-𝜅B kinaseand MAP kinases, which in turn modulate the transcrip-tional activities of the NF-kB and AP-1 families, respectively.However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for torilinmediated TAK1 inactivation remains to be addressed.Since TAK1, amember of theMAPKKK family, is thoughtto be a key modulator of adaptive and innate immunitythat mediates inducible transcription factors NF-𝜅B and AP-1 and, therefore, plays a crucial role in regulating the genesthat mediate inflammation [30, 42], we thought that naturalcompounds such as torilin that target TAK1 activation maybe an attractive strategy to treat inflammatory responses.Thepresent study together with our previous report [26] indi-cated that torilin plays a crucial role against TAK1 mediatedcellular response to LPS-induced and collagen-induced [26]inflammatory stimuli. TAK1 is a critical integration checkpoint for innate and adapted immune responses upstream ofMAPkinase and I-kB kinase pathways [3, 43]. In linewith thisstudy, TAK1-deficient cells failed to activate NF-𝜅B andMAPkinases in response to IL-1𝛽, TNF, and TLR ligands [30]. Inaddition to its role in innate immunity, recent studies havedefined an essential role of TAK1 in T cell receptor- and B cellreceptor-induced activation of NF-kB and in the survival anddevelopment of immune cells, includingmature B cells and Tcells [3, 43–45]. In B cells, TAK1 is reported to be required forB cell development andNF-kB andMAPKactivation inducedby cytokines, TLR ligands, and BCR stimuli [3, 45].In conclusion, we demonstrate that torilin arrested LPS-induced TAK1 kinase activation with a subsequent suppres-sion in IKK-mediated I-𝜅B phosphorylation NF-𝜅B translo-cation. In addition, it attenuated TAK1 mediated MAPKsactivation and AP1 transactivation. Together, the data ledto suppression of NF-𝜅B and AP-1 regulated inflammatorymediator and cytokine expressions, suggesting the test com-pound’s potential as a candidate anti-inflammatory agent.AbbreviationsCOX-2: Cyclooxygenase-2GM-CSF: Granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factorIKK or I𝜅B kinase: Inhibitory nuclear factor kappa-BkinaseIL-1𝛽: Interleukin-1𝛽IL-6: Interleukin-6iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthaseMAPKs: Mitogen activated protein kinasesNF-𝜅B: Nuclear factor kappa-BNO: Nitric oxidePGE2: Prostaglandin E2PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatePKB/Akt: Protein kinase BRT-PCR: Reverse transcription PCRTNF-𝛼: Tumor necrosis factor-𝛼TAK1: TGF𝛽-activated kinase 1TAB1/2: TGF𝛽-activated kinase 1 bindproteins 1 and 2.Competing InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the National Research Foun-dation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean government(Grant no. 2015R1D1A1A09057204) and by Research BaseConstruction Fund Support Program funded by ChonbukNational University in 2016.References[1] S.
