DiaXanthone production in Hypericum perforatum (HP) suspension cultures in response to elicitation byAgrobacterium tumefaciens co-cultivation has been studied. RNA blot analyses of HP cells co-cultivatedwith A. tumefaciens have shown a rapid up-regulation of genes encoding important enzymes of the gen-eral phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase) andxanthone biosynthesis (BPS, benzophenone synthase). Analyses of HPLC chromatograms of methanolicextracts of control and elicited cells (HP cells that were co-cultivated for 24 h with A. tumefaciens) haverevealed a 12-fold increase in total xanthone concentration and also the emergence of many xanthonesafter elicitation. Methanolic extract of elicited cells exhibited signiﬁcantly higher antioxidant and antimi-crobial competence than the equivalent extract of control HP cells indicating that these properties havebeen signiﬁcantly increased in HP cells after elicitation. Four major de novo synthesized xanthones havebeen identiﬁed as 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone, 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-2-prenyl xanthone,1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-8-prenyl xanthone and paxanthone. Antioxidant and antimicrobial charac-terization of these de novo xanthones have revealed that xanthones play dual function in plant cells dur-ing biotic stress: (1) as antioxidants to protect the cells from oxidative damage and (2) as phytoalexins toimpair the pathogen growth. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionHypericum, a genus of the family Clusiaceae, is widely used intraditional medicine throughout the world since ancient times.The genus is known to produce several xanthones (Dias et al.,2000, 2001; Dias, 2003; Ferrari et al., 2005; Tanaka and Takaishi,2006).Xanthones are a class of polyphenolics that exhibit well-docu-mented pharmacological properties, mainly due to their oxygen-ated heterocyclic nature and diversity of functional groups. Theyhave been described as strong scavengers of free radicals (Jianget al., 2004). In addition, many of the xanthones have been re-ported to be active against bacteria including methicillin/multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Rukachaisirikul et al., 2003,2005; Sukpondma et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2008), vancomycin resis-tant Enterococci (Sakagami et al., 2005),Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Suksamrarn et al., 2003), etc. Some xanthones even surpass theantimicrobial activity of traditional antibiotics (Iinuma et al.,1996; Xiao et al., 2008). Other pharmacological properties of xant-hones include anti-inﬂammatory (Banerjee et al., 2000), cancer-chemopreventive (Ito et al., 2003), hepatoprotective (Tian et al.,ll rights reserved.fax: +351 53 678980.s).2005), cardiovascular protective (Jiang et al., 2004), selective inhi-bition of cyclooxygenase-2 (Zou et al., 2005), inhibition of platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced hypotension (Ishiguro et al., 2002;Oku et al., 2005) and cytotoxic activities (Yimdjo et al., 2004;Boonsri et al., 2006; Suksamrarn et al., 2006).Plant cells respond to pathogens predominantly by mobilizingtheir secondary metabolites, which tend to protect the plantcells from pathogen attack. In this context, Beerhues and Berger(1995) observed an increase in xanthone accumulation in sus-pended cells of Centaurium species upon elicitation with yeastextract and methyl jasmonate (MeJ). Conceição et al. (2006) ob-served a similar response (xanthone accumulation) in Hypericumperforatum suspended cells elicited with Colletotrichum gloeospo-rioides cell wall extracts. The induced xanthone accumulationwas further increased (by at least 12-fold) when the HP cellswere primed with either MeJ or salicylic acid (well known de-fense signaling compounds in plants), an important observation,which explains possible role of xanthones in plant cells underbiotic stress.Here, we show that the antioxidant and antimicrobial potentialshave been signiﬁcantly increased in HP cells after elicitation withAgrobacterium tumefaciens due to the rapid up-regulation of xan-thone metabolism. Putative roles of xanthone metabolism in HPcells under conditions of biotic stress are discussed.66 G. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–732. Results and discussion2.1. Induction of xanthone biosynthesis is a defense response2.1.1. Xanthone proﬁle of HP cells was altered after co-cultivation withA. tumefaciensMajor classes of phenolic compounds produced by cultured HPcells under normal conditions are ﬂavonoids and xanthones(Fig. 1a, F, ﬂavonoid and X, xanthone). Though the ﬂavonoid proﬁleremained unaltered after elicitation, xanthone proﬁle has signiﬁ-cantly changed within 24 h (Fig. 1b). With new xanthones, the totalxanthone content increased 12-fold (Fig. 2) indicating that xan-thone biosynthesis has potential role in the biotic interaction. Sim-ilar patterns of xanthone accumulation has also been observed in5003000250020001500100005003000250020001500100000 250 25minutes — 254minutes — 254MAUMAUXXFFFFXXMabM1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-8-prenyl xanthonecFig. 1.

Peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 were identiﬁed as 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthoxanthone and paxanthone, respectively. Structural formulae of these xanthones are shoHP cells that were elicited with fungal extracts or primed withplant defense signaling compounds such as MeJ and salicylic acid(Conceição et al., 2006). Likewise, xanthones were seen accumu-lated when cell cultures were treated with MeJ and yeast-extractin Centaurium species (Beerhues and Berger, 1995), H. androsae-mum and Centaurium erythraea (Abd El-Mawla et al., 2001); the lat-ter cell cultures exhibited new xanthones after MeJ treatment. Allthese observations support the participation of xanthones in plantdefense response.Although mangiferin (peak denoted as ‘M’) found along withfew other unidentiﬁed xanthones in both control and treated cells,new xanthones appeared in the HP cells treated with A. tumefaciens(Figs. 1a and b).

The major xanthone in the treated HP cellswas 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenylxanthone, which accounted for23% of the total xanthones (Table 1). This was found to be the samecompound that was elicited by MeJ in H. androsaemum cell cultures(Abd El-Mawla et al., 2001), and, might be a common compoundinduced in both H. perforatum and H. androsaemum in responseto the biotic stress.2.1.2. Xanthone production in response to elicitation by A. tumefaciensis regulated by transcriptional control of enzymes participating in thexanthone biosynthesis pathwayBPS gene expression was found to be strongly up-regulated inHP cells upon treatment with A. tumefaciens as revealed by north-ern blot analysis (Fig. 3d). While BPS transcripts were undetectablein control HP cells, they accumulated within 4 h of A. tumefacienschallenge, and reached the maximum in 12 h and declined thenon. A more or less similar pattern of expression was observed forPAL gene (Fig. 3b), which is participating in the biosynthesis ofxanthone precursor and 4CL gene (Fig. 3c) that is related to theubiquitous activation of general phenylpropanoid pathway follow-ing elicitation. The changes in the PAL mRNA levels agree quitewell with the changes in the PAL activity level in elicited H. andro-saemum cell cultures (Abd El-Mawla and Beerhues, 2002).The rapidly induced expression of PAL, 4CL and BPS genes in HPcells co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens indicates that the xanthonebiosynthetic pathway is activated immediately after sensing thepathogen. PAL, the ﬁrst enzyme of the general phenylpropanoidpathway, catalyses the deamination of phe to cinnamic acid.

BPS is an important enzyme,which catalyses the stepwise condensation of activated benzoicacids with three molecules of malonyl-CoA (Beerhues, 1996;Schmidt and Beerhues, 1997) and the resulting benzophenones un-dergo intra-molecular cyclization to give xanthones (Peters et al.,1998). The enzyme 4CL plays a key role in channelling carbon ﬂowinto diverse branch pathways of phenylpropanoid metabolism,which serves important functions in plant growth and adaptationto environmental perturbations (Ehlting et al., 1999).Activation of phenylpropanoid metabolism has been describedas an almost ubiquitous feature of plant response to stress condi-tions (Dixon and Paiva, 1995). Marked increase in PAL synthesisand corresponding mRNA accumulation occur in response tomicrobial or endogenous elicitors has been reported in manyplant-pathogen systems (Sharan et al., 1998). Thus, xanthone bio-synthesis in response to A. tumefaciens treatment is believed to beregulated by transcriptional control of enzymes participating in thepathway.2.2. Xanthones protect HP cells from oxidative stress2.2.1. ROS scavenging potential of HP cells increases after elicitationwith A. tumefaciensHP cells taken at different time intervals (0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180and 240 min) following A. tumefaciens challenge were incubatedwith H2DCFDA, a probe that measures the cellular ROS levels inter-nally. HP cells produced a biphasic oxidative burst after the chal-lenge (Fig. 4a) an observation already reported (Franklin et al.,2008). Because of the highly cytotoxic and reactive nature ofROS, their accumulation must be under tight control (Shao et al.,2008). If not scavenged, the ROS would eventually lead to criticallevels of H2O2 (Scandalios, 1993).

Likewise, inhibition of synaptosomal lipid peroxidation is higher in themethanolic extract of elicited cells than control cells (b).68 G. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–73the cellular macromolecules of both the pathogen and the host andthus might lead to cell death in both organisms.The rate of membrane lipid peroxidation in untreated (control)HP cells doubled (from approximately 23 to 47 nmol MDA/g fr. wt)as the cultures aged (during the experimental period of 5 days,Fig. 4b); whereas in the HP cells that have been co-cultivated withA. tumefaciens, the level of membrane lipid peroxidation remainedsimilar to the control on day one and thereafter signiﬁcantly de-clined to about 70% of its initial value (16 vs. 23 nmol MDA/g fr.wt) over the period of 5 days, in spite of the intense oxidative burstobserved. Moreover, HP cells retained 100% viability throughoutthe experimental with and without the pathogen. This observationhas been reported before (Franklin et al., 2008).Analysis of the culture medium of the elicited HP cultures (byxylenol orange method) did not show the presence of H2O2. Thisindicated that the intense oxidative burst produced internally inthe HP cells was not transported outside of the cells. Absence ofH2O2 in the extracellular medium further suggests that the ROSproduced by HP cells might have been readily scavenged either be-fore or immediately after their conversion into H2O2.2.2.2. Increased ROS scavenging potential of elicited HP cells is due toinduced xanthone biosynthesisIn order to determine whether the xanthones synthesized anewby the cells after elicitation (Fig. 1b) have ROS scavenging activity,we compared the antioxidant potential of the total phenolics ofboth the control and elicited HP cells that was extracted withMeOH from (co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens for 24 h) in two dif-ferent antioxidant model assays (DPPH reduction and TBARS).Methanolic extracts of elicited cells showed a higher degree of rad-ical scavenging activity (DPPH reduction) with a greater capacityfor preventing synaptosomal lipid peroxidation, than equivalentextracts obtained from non-elicited (control) cells (Figs. 5a and b).In DPPH reduction assay, the EC50 values were 0.7 mg dry wt/mland 0.44 mg dry wt/ml respectively for the control and elicitedcells (Fig. 5a). Similarly in synaptosomal lipid peroxidation inhibi-tion assay, the EC50 values were 0.17 mg dry wt/ml and 0.04 mgdry wt/ml respectively for the control and elicited cells (Fig. 5b).Altogether, the free radical scavenging capacity was increased0.6-fold and the protection against membrane lipid peroxidtionwas increased about 3.25-folds in HP cells after elicitation. The in-creased antioxidant activity can possibly be attributed to the largeamounts of xanthones produced in HP cells after elicitation.In the present study, the ﬁrst ROS burst (Fig. 4a) occurred rela-tively earlier (in 15 min) than the up-regulation of xanthone bio-synthesis (BPS mRNA starts to accumulate at 4 h and attainmaximum at 12 h) after treating with the bacterium. In fact, thisburst was seen to be short-lived and might have been bufferedby the existing phenolics (xanthones plus ﬂavonoids). Our hypoth-G. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–73 69esis that the oxidative burst that occurred in the initial phase of theincompatible plant-pathogen interactions is responsible for theinduction of defense reactions agrees with that of Arias et al.(2005). Moreover, ROS has complex downstream effects on sec-ondary metabolism as signalling molecules (Chen et al., 1993;Vanderauwera et al., 2005; Foyer and Noctor, 2005). Hence, theﬁrst ROS burst could have acted as signal to prime the xanthonebiosynthesis, and the massive xanthone production could be re-lated to the second phase of ROS production, which is more intenseand long-lasting, as we observed. During such state and thereafter,the cells would need additional antioxidant support conferred byxanthones produced anew, to achieve cellular ROS homeostasis.2.2.3. De novo synthesized xanthones have antioxidant propertiesIn order to check the contributions of the de novo xanthones inthe hiked antioxidant potential of elicited cells, we studied theantioxidant efﬁcacies of the four xanthones identiﬁed in elicitedHP cells methanolic extract (Fig. 1c). These xanthones showed anti-radical activity (DPPH reduction) to varying degrees (Fig. 6a) andwere very effective in protecting against synaptosomal lipid perox-idation (Fig. 6b). The synaptosomal lipid peroxidation inhibitoryactivity of 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone (EC50 =0.08 lg/ml, Fig. 6b) was the highest among tested xanthones. Com-plete inhibition of induced synaptosome lipid peroxidation by thisxanthone even at considerably low concentration (1.0 lg/ml) indi-cates that even a small increase could have signiﬁcant antioxidantprotection for the host cells.Previous studies (Pinto et al., 2005; Foti et al., 2005) have shownthat xanthones could effectively suppress ROS production and pre-0 5 10 15 20 25010203040504123Xanthone con.

Hence, we conclude that the up-regulationof xanthone biosynthesis aids HP cells to defend against bioticstress produced during the pathogenic challenge. This hypothesiscould also explain the long-term viability/survival of HP cells dur-ing extended periods of pathogenic interactions (Franklin et al.,2007, 2008).2.3. Xanthones provide antimicrobial protection to HP cells2.3.1. Antimicrobial potential of HP cells increased after elicitationIt was remarkable to ﬁnd the viability of A. tumefaciens gradu-ally declining reaching (<1%) after 12 h of co-cultivation (Franklinet al., 2008) and the decline was about 50% at 5–6 h, at a timewhen xanthones start accumulating (Abd El-Mawla and Beerhues,2002). To check whether the induced xanthone biosynthesis of HPcells is responsible for the reduced bacterial viability, we com-pared the antimicrobial potentials of methanolic extracts of con-trol and cells co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens for 24 h period.Concentrations of methanolic extracts equivalent to 20 mg drywt elicited HP cells/ml and 200 mg dry wt control HP cells/mlcould kill 250  107 A. tumefaciens cells within 24 h of incubationFig. 7. Antimicrobial potential of H. perforatum cells after 24 h co-cultivation withA. tumefaciens.

Results of the present study explaining the signiﬁcance of xanthones in thisplant-pathogen interaction is summarized as a model.70 G. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–73(Fig. 7). Thus, the antimicrobial potential of HP cells has been in-creased 10 times after elicitation, which can be attributed to thexanthones accumulation.Since the methanolic extract of control cells also showed inhibi-tion of A. tumefaciens at higher concentrations, it can be concludedthat antimicrobial compounds are present in control cells too; butat relatively low concentrations, acting as phytoanticipins (Dixon,2001). With biotic elicitation, the amount of total xanthones in-creased and new xanthones are produced, eventually to achieve ahigher biological response, i.e. killing of bacterial cells.2.3.2. De novo synthesized paxanthone display antimicrobial activityFrom earlier studies, it is found that many xanthones possessantimicrobial activities against bacteria (Suksamrarn et al., 2003,2006; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Laphookhieo et al., 2006; Xiao et al.,2008). Hence, we studied the antimicrobial activities of the fourxanthones identiﬁed in the elicited HP cells (peaks 1–4 of Figs.1b and c) by disc diffusion method. Of the four tested, only pax-anthone (4) showed a clear inhibition zone against A. tumefaciensgrowth (Fig. 8a). So, not all of the xanthones produced by HP cellsafter elicitation have antimicrobial activity. The dose-dependentantimicrobial activity of paxanthone was studied by incorporatingvarying concentrations of paxanthone in A. tumefaciens suspension.0 50 100 150 200 2500255075100Paxanthone (  g/ml)% cfu reduction(24 h)1234abFig. 8. Antimicrobial potential of de novo xanthones (1–4) isolated from elicited HPcells against A. tumefaciens. Among the four xanthones tested, only paxanthone (1)showed a clear zone of A. tumefaciens inhibition in disc diffusion method (a) andwhen incorporated into A. tumefaciens suspension, showed a concentration-dependent colony forming unit reduction (b).As seen in Fig. 8b, with the maximum concentration of paxanthonetested (200 lg/ml), we did not observe 100% reduction of A. tume-feciens viability. In contrast, a concentration of methanolic extractthat is equivalent to 20 mg dry wt elicited cells/ml was sufﬁcient toachieve 100% reduction in A. tumefaciens viability in 24 h (Fig. 7).Hence we believe antimicrobial compound(s) other than paxanth-one or a synergism between this xanthone and other compounds ofelicited cells might exist.Pinheiro et al. (2003) had reported that assiguxanthone-B, axanthone isolated from Kielmeyera variabilis showed only a moder-ate antibacterial activity (minimal inhibitory concentra-tion = 25.0 lg/ml) against Bacillus subtilis, in contrast to themethanolic extract of the plant (minimal inhibitory concentra-tion = 1.95 lg/ml). They found that the antimicrobial potential ofassiguxanthone-B could be increased 4-fold, when combined with1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxy-2-prenyl xanthone. Mixture of the two wasable to inhibit B. subtilis at 6.25 lg/ml concentration. This observa-tion demonstrates that the combination was active at much lowerconcentrations than each of the single compounds. Other evi-dences (Briskin, 2000) also indicate that many complex phytomed-icines (plant extracts) exert biological or pharmaceutical effectsthrough synergistic actions of several compounds.3. ConclusionIn summary, we provide evidence for the activation of second-ary metabolism in HP cells in general and xanthone biosynthesis inparticular under elicitation by A. tumefaciens co-cultivation. Wealso present data that show the activation of xanthone biosynthe-sis having dual defense function in HP as described in the model(Fig. 9). On the one hand, xanthones constitute a powerful antiox-idant system of protecting the host cells from self-generated ROSand subsequent oxidative damage. On the other hand, xanthoneshave also the potential to act as phytoalexin to help the host to im-pair and eventually kill the pathogen. In fact, both functions mayhelp to prevent disease development by their concerted action.4. Experimental4.1. Growth and elicitation of HP cellsH. perforatum cell suspension culture was established from thevariety ‘Helos’ (Richters seeds, Ontario, Canada) and maintained asper Dias et al. (2001). Five days after subculture, cells suspensionsfrom several ﬂasks were aseptically collected into a sterile beakerG. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–73 71and the cell density was estimated in an improved Neubauerhaemocytometer (Neubauer, Wertheim, Germany). After adjustingthe cell concentration to about 5000 HP cells/ml with sterile MSmedium, 80 ml aliquots were redistributed to each ﬂask. A. tum-efaciens stock was prepared as described before (Franklin et al.,2008). A set of 10 ﬂasks, each containing 80 ml of this HP cell sus-pension, were inoculated A. tumefaciens such that to reach250  107 bacterial cells/ml. Another set of 10 ﬂasks each contain-ing 80 ml of just HP cell suspension served as control. Treated andcontrol cultures were incubated in growth chamber at 25 C undera photoperiod of 16 h light. After 24 h (or at the time indicated)cells were harvested by vacuum ﬁltration and freeze-dried.4.2. Measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membranelipid peroxidation4.2.1. Detection of ROS in the intracellular spaceIntracellular ROS production in control and co-cultivated cellswas measured using the ﬂuorogenic dichlorodihydroﬂuoresceindiacetate (H2DCFDA) probe (Invitrogen, Germany). In this method,the de-acetylation of H2DCFDA by cellular esterases results in theproduction of an oxidant-sensitive compound dichlorodihydroﬂu-orescein (H2DCF), which can be determined spectro-ﬂourimetrically.To measure the intracellular ROS, 1.0 ml HP cell suspension cul-ture from the treatment and control were transferred to Eppendorftubes containing 10 ll of 200 lM H2DCFDA at different time inter-vals (0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min) of A. tumefaciens inocula-tion. The mixture was vortexed 20 s and incubated in dark for15 min. Then, the cells were spun down in a table-top centrifugeat 6000g for 30 s and 0.5 ml supernatant was taken in a plastic cuv-ette containing 2.5 ml sterile distilled H2O. The ﬂuorescence wasread in a spectroﬂourimeter (Perkin Elmer LS50 Luminescencespectrometer, Buckinghamshire, UK) with 488 nm excitation and525 nm emission for 1 s.4.2.2. Detection of ROS in the extracellular spaceHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration in the medium wasmeasured by Ferric-xylenol orange (FOX1) method (Wolff, 1994).This method is based on the peroxide-mediated oxidation of Fe2+,followed by the reaction of Fe3+ with xylenol orange. This methodis extremely sensitive and used to measure low levels of H2O-sol-uble hydroperoxide present in the aqueous phase.From the control and treated cultures, 1.0 ml suspension wastaken in an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged in order to pellet thecells down. Then, 500 ll of the supernatant was transferred toEppendorf tubes containing 500 ll of xylanol orange reagent(500 lM NH4FeSO4, 50 mM H2SO4, 200 lM xylenol orange, and200 mM sorbitol). The mixture was vortexed brieﬂy and incubatedin dark for 45 min. Absorbance of the Fe3+-xylenol orange complexwas measured in a spectrophotometer at 560 nm and the concen-tration of H2O2 in the medium was calculated by plotting thosevalues on H2O2 standard graph.4.2.3. Detection of ROS-induced membrane lipid peroxidation in HPcellsHP cells were harvested by vacuum ﬁltration after 24, 48, 72and 120 h of A. tumefaciens inoculation. Membrane lipid peroxida-tion was determined by measuring the amount of MDA as de-scribed by Unyayar et al. (2006). Brieﬂy, 200 mg fr. wt of cellswere homogenized in 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solu-tion. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 minat room temperature. A 0.5 ml aliquot was mixed with 0.5 mlfreshly prepared TBA reagent (0.5% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in20% TCA) in a screw cap tube and heated at 96 C in a boiling waterbath. After 25 min, the tubes were snap-cooled in ice to stop thereaction and centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge at 10000 rpmfor 5 min. Absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at532 nm and corrected for non-speciﬁc turbidity by subtractingthe absorbance at 600 nm. Reaction mixture containing 0.5 ml 5%TCA and 0.5 ml of TBA reagent served as blank. MDA content wasdetermined using the absorption coefﬁcient of 1.56  105cm2 mol1.4.3. Extraction and analysis of phenolics from HP cellsEqual quantity of HP biomass of control and elicited cells wereextracted under dark in 90% MeOH. Brieﬂy, 4 g dry wt was taken ina Falcon tube that contained 40 ml 90% MeOH and sonicated 1 hand kept under dark for 24 h with frequent mixing. Cell debriswas spun down by centrifugation at 3,000g 15 min in a table-topcentrifuge. The supernatant was evaporated under vacuum, anddissolved in 2 ml of DMSO to obtain 2 mg dry wt/ll ﬁnal concen-tration. Phenolic compounds were analyzed by HPLC–DAD as de-scribed previously (Dias et al., 1999). Chromatographicseparation was carried out on an RP C18 column (Merck, Ger-many), using H2O/HCO2H (99:1) and MeOH as the mobile phasesand absorbance was recorded at 254, 350 and 590 nm.The quantiﬁcation of the phenolic constituents was done by theexternal standard method, using a solution containing chlorogenicacid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, quercetrin, hypericin and mangif-erin as reference compounds in MeOH. Flavonoids were quantiﬁedas quercetin equivalents at 350 nm and xanthones as mangiferinequivalents at 254 nm.4.4. RNA isolation and blot hybridizationAbout 500 mg fr. wt HP cells were collected after 0, 4, 12 and24 h A. tumefaciens addition to the cultures and frozen in liquidnitrogen. Total RNA was isolated according to Çakir et al. (2003),denatured, separated on agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferredto nylon membrane (Hybond–N, Amersham Biosciences, Bucking-ham, UK) by capillary transfer. DNA fragments speciﬁc to phenyl-alanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) andbenzophenone synthase (BPS) cDNAs (from H. perforatum) were la-beled with [a–32P] dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using Prime-a-Gene labeling kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and used ashybridization probe in 2X SSC at 65 C. Blots were washed twicewith 2X SSC + 0.1% SDS each for 15 min followed by 0.1XSSC + 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 65 C. The blots were exposed to theimaging screen for 12 h and scanned in a Personal Molecular Ima-ger (Bio–Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).4.5. Free radical-scavenger activity (DPPH assay)The antiradical activity of methanolic extracts from HP cells andisolated xanthones (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone,1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-2-prenyl xanthone, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-meth-oxy-8-prenyl xanthone and paxanthone) were determined by the1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, as described previ-ously (Silva et al., 2005). The antiradical activity of each samplewas evaluated using a series of dilutions, in order to obtain a largespectrum of sample concentrations. The reaction solution con-sisted of 0.1 ml diluted sample and 1.4 ml of 80 lM DPPH (dis-solved in 100% EtOH). The absorbance was monitoredcontinuously at 515 nm with a Perkin–Elmer UV/VIS SpectrometerLambda2, assuring that the reaction was complete (plateau state).The percentage of reduced DPPH at steady state (DPPH–R) was cal-culated and these values were plotted against the concentrationsmethanolic extracts or of pure compounds. A decrease by 50% ofthe initial DPPH concentration was deﬁned as the half maximaleffective concentration (EC50).72 G. Franklin et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 65–734.6. Inhibition of synaptosomal lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay)Synaptosomal fraction of male Wistar rat brains was isolatedand thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay was per-formed as described previously (Silva et al., 2005). Brieﬂy, lipidperoxidation was induced in synaptosomes using an oxidant pair(800 lM ascorbic acid and 2.5 lM FeSO4) in Krebs buffer(132 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 6 mM glu-cose, 10 mM Hepes–Na, pH 7.4) at 37 C for 15 min. Synaptosomes,without the oxidant pair served as negative control to calculate thebasal lipid peroxidation level. The effect of methanolic extracts andisolated xanthones (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone,1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-2-prenyl xanthone, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-meth-oxy-8-prenyl xanthone and paxanthone) on lipid peroxidation wasrecorded by adding them to the reaction mixture at different con-centration. The malondialdehyde (MDA)–thiobarbituric acid (TBA)complex was recorded at 530 nm, after reaction of samples withtrichloroacetic acid (40%, w/v) and TBA (0.67%, w/v) (96 C,10 min) and centrifugation (3000g, 10 min). The amount of MDAformed was calculated using the absorption coefﬁcient of1.56  105 cm2 mol1. Values were corrected for the levels of basalperoxidation, obtained during the assay. A decrease by 50% of thevalue of lipid peroxidation, induced by ascorbate-Fe2+, was deﬁnedas the EC50.4.7. Determination of antibacterial activity (colony forming units anddisc diffusion)The stock A. tumefaciens suspension obtained as described be-fore (Franklin et al., 2008) was diluted in MS medium to approxi-mately 250  108 CFU/ml. Aliquots (100 ll) from this bacterialsuspension were then added to 900 ll of sterile MS medium con-taining methanolic extracts of control and elicited HP cells, toachieve a range of ﬁnal concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, 50 and100 ll/ml). Similarly, paxanthone (5 mg/ml dissolved in DMSO)was incorporated into bacterial suspension at different concentra-tions (0, 10, 25, 100 and 200 lg/ml). Bacterial suspensions that re-ceived the corresponding concentration of DMSO (0, 2, 5, 20 and40 ll/ml) served as control for paxanthone treatment. All the sam-ples were maintained on a shaker at 200 rpm at 28 C for 24 h. Sub-sequently, 100 ll aliquot from each sample was serially diluted to106 and spread on Petri dishes containing 20 ml Luria–Bertani(LB) medium augmented with 25 mg/l rifampicin and 50 mg/lkanamycin. The colony forming units on each plate were countedafter incubation for 2 days at 28 C and the percentage of viabilitywas calculated.Qualitative antimicrobial activity of isolated xanthones wasdetermined by a classical disc diffusion assay. All the isolated xant-hones (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-8-prenyl xanthone, 1,3,6,7-tetrahydr-oxy-2-prenyl xanthone, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-8-prenylxanthone and paxanthone) were dissolved separately in DMSO toobtain 5 mg/ml stock concentration. Sterile paper discs loadedwith 10 ll were dried at RT and placed onto LB medium spreadwith 100 ll A. tumefaciens suspension (250  107/ml) and incu-bated for 2 days at 28 C.4.8. Statistical analysesFor all the treatments, at least three independent experimentseach with three replica were done. Flavonoids and xanthone con-tent of control and elicited HP cells were compared statisticallyby two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. In thesame manner, the levels of membrane lipid peroxidation in HPcells after different time periods of A. tumefaciens inoculation werecompared. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPadPrism Software, version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software,San Diego, CA, USA).AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnolo-gia (POCTI/AGR/40283/2001).
