Abstract: 
As a part of our continuing investigation of Jordanian Colchicum species, the biologically active components of 
Colchicum hierosolymitanum Feinbr and Colchicum tunicatum Feinbr (Colchicaceae) were pursued. The brine 
shrimp lethality test (BSLT) was used to direct the fractionation and isolation of active components. Five and 
four known colchicinoids were isolated and characterized from C. tunicatum and C. hierosolymitanum, 
respectively. The known colchicinoids, reported for the first time from these two species are: (-)-colchicine (I), 
3-demethyl-(-)-colchicine (II), (-)-cornigerine (III), β-lumicolchicine (IV), and (-)-androbiphenyline (V) from C. 
tunicatum, and (-)-colchicine (I), 2-demethyl-(-)-colchicine (VI), (-)-cornigerine (III), and β-lumicolchicine (IV) 
from C. hierosolymitanum. The chemical structures of the isolated compounds have been elucidated using a 
series of spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques principally; 1D-NMR (
1
H and 
13
C) and low resolution EI-
MS and APCIMS. All pure compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines; 
MCF-7 human breast carcinoma, NCI-H460 human large cell lung carcinoma, and SF-268 human astrocytoma. 
(-)-Colchicine (I) and (-)-cornigerine (III) were found to be the most bioactive of the identified compounds with 
EC50 values in the range of 0.016-0.097 μM.

1. Introduction  
   
Jordan acts as a flora bridge between the continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and it is situated at the junction 
of four phyto-geographical areas, the Mediterranean, the Irano-Turanean, the Saharo-Arabian, and the Tropical 
or Sudanian 1,2. Due to its position at these crossroads of climatic and botanic regions, Jordan has a rich and 
somewhat unique biodiversity of wild plants 3,4. 
The genus Colchicum belongs to the family Colchicaceae, which comprises 19 genera, and 225 species 5. In 
Jordan, at least nine species of Colchicum can be found in the wild, namely: Colchicum brachyphyllum Boiss. & 
Haussk. ex Boiss., C. crocifolium Boiss., C. hierosolymitanum Feinbr, C. ritchii. R. Br., C. schimperi Janka, C. 
stevenii Kunth, C. tauri Siehe ex Stef., C. triphyllum Kunze, and C. tunicatum Feinbr 1,6,7. 
The marked medicinal and/or toxic properties of some species of the genus Colchicum have been known for 
more than 2000 years. Dioscorides was aware of their toxic properties; writings of Arab investigators in the 
tenth century recommended their use in gout 8,9. 
Colchicine (I), the major alkaloid of C. autumnale, which was first isolated in 1820 by Pelletier and Caventou 
10, is still used today for the treatment of gout 11, and in a number of proinflammatory disorders, such as 
familial Mediterranean fever 12, and Behcet's disease 13. Colchicine (I) was found to posses potent antitumor 
activity in clinical investigations. However, its use as an antineoplastic agent is limited, due to lack of tumor 
selectivity and high toxicity 14,15. Among colchicine analogs, demecolcine, is used for treatment of myelocytic 
leukemia and malignant lymphoma 16. Colchicine is also used in biological and breeding studies to produce 
polyploidy, or multiplication of the chromosomes in the cell nucleus 9. 
In our continuing studies on Jordanian Colchicum species 17-19, the colchicinoids of C. hierosolymitanum and 
C. tunicatum were pursued, as, to the best of our knowledge, these two species have not been investigated 
previously for bioactive constituents. 
Colchicum tunicatum is one of the first native geophytes to flower (September-October). It is characterized as a 
perennial herb, with underground corms, covered by thick, dark brown-black scales, growing at marginal lands 
and clay-like soil of desert 1, 7, 20. 
Colchicum hierosolymitanum is characterized as a perennial herb, which flowers in autumn (October--
November). It is distinguished by large, underground corms, which have a conical, almost snail-like 
appearance, and are covered by onion-like scales. It is found growing in mountains in heavy soil 1,7. 
2. Results and discussion  
   
Guided by the brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT), five pure known compounds were isolated from roots, corms, 
stems, and leaves of C. tunicatum for the first time. These compounds can be categorized into three classes: 
colchicine-type: (-)-colchicine (I) (2.320 g, 0.1% w/w), 3-demethyl-(-)-colchicine (II) (109.18 mg, 0.009% 
w/w), and (-)-cornigerine (III) (37.78 mg, 0.003% w/w); β-lumiderivatives: β-lumicolchicine (IV) (16.72 mg, 
0.002% w/w); and allocolchicine-type: (-)-androbiphenyline (V) (7.61 mg, 0.0005% w/w). The corms of C. 
hierosolymitanum yielded four known compounds, which were new to the species, and that can be categorized 
into two classes: colchicine-type: (-)-colchicine (I) (325 mg, 0.05% w/w), 2-demethyl-(-)-colchicine (VI) (20 
mg, 0.003% w/w), and (-)-cornigerine (III) (5 mg, 0.001% w/w); and β-lumiderivatives: β-lumicolchicine (IV) 
(35 mg, 0.005% w/w). The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated using a series of spectroscopic 
and spectrometric techniques principally; 1D-NMR (
1
H and 
13
C) and low resolution EI-MS and APCIMS, and 
by comparisons of these spectral data with those reported in the literature 19,21-24 (figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1. The structures of colchicinoids from C. tunicatum (I-V) and C. hierosolymitanum (I, III, IV, and VI).  
Liquid--liquid fractions A-E, which were obtained according to the method of im nek and coworkers 25,26, 
from both species and for all plant parts were tested for toxicity against the BSLT (table 1). Fraction C, the most 
active fraction, was pursued for further purification. Compounds I--VI were tested for general toxicity against 
the BSLT, and for anticancer activity against the human cancer cell panel. Three cancer cell lines were selected: 
MCF-7 human breast carcinoma, NCI-H460 human large cell lung carcinoma, and SF-268 human astrocytoma. 
In the BSLT (table 2), compounds I and III were by far the most toxic, with LC50 values of 3.7 and 7.7 µg mL
-
1
, respectively, with all other colchicinoids being approximately an order of magnitude less toxic. Indeed, this 
structure-activity relationship held against the human cancer cell panel, with I (EC50 value: 0.016-0.025 µg mL
-
1
) and III (EC50 value: 0.061-0.097 µg mL
-1
) exhibiting activity on the same order of magnitude as the positive 
control, camptothecin. This positive correlation between the two bioassays illustrates and adds to the power of 
the BSLT as a simple, rapid, bench-top, in-house screening bioassay capable of identifying cytotoxic 
compounds. However, the other compounds should not be discounted for their cytotoxic activity, as the BSLT 
is limited in its predictive capacity to distinguish between strong-to-moderate and weak potency cytotoxic 
compounds. The BSLT represents a quick initial screen for potent cytotoxins, but a finer level of discrimination 
for anticancer activity required the human cancer cell panel. Similar results with respect to the BSLT and the 
human cancer cell panel were noted in an earlier study of a related species of Colchicum 19.

3. Materials and methods  
   
3.1. General  
   
All NMR experiments were performed in CDCl3 with TMS as an internal standard; a Bruker DPX-300 
instrument was utilized for the 
1
H-, 
13
C-NMR. The APCIMS were determined on an Applied Biosystems/MDS 
Sciex API 150 EX single quadrupole LC/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); EI-MS 70 eV on 
VG-7070 E LREI. The HPLC was performed on a Lachrom® MERCK-HITACHI (Tokyo, Japan), equipped 
with quaternary gradient L-7150 pump, L-7455 Diode-Array Detector, L-7200 auto-sampler, and D-7000 
Interface. The preparative HPLC column was a Hibar® MERCK, pre-packed column RT 250-25, Lichrosorb® 
RP-18 (7 µm). Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel 60 (0.06-0.2 mm; 70-230 mesh) and 
TLC utilized silica gel 60 with gypsum and pigment addition for UV visualization (both from Scharlau Chemie 
S.A., Barcelona, Spain). The TLC spots were visualized by UV (VILBER LOURMAT, 4 W--254 nm Tube) or 
made visible by spraying the developed plates with 5% phosphomolybdic acid in EtOH. 
3.2. Plant material  
   
Corms, stems, leaves, and roots of C. tunicatum were collected during its vegetating stage from al-Mafraq in the 
Northern part of Jordan in January 2003. The collected materials were identified by Prof. Dawud Al-Eisawi, 
plant taxonomist, Faculty of Agriculture, Jordan University, Amman, Jordan. Flowers, stems, and corms of wild 
C. hierosolymitanum were collected from Erhaba, Irbid, in the Northern part of Jordan in October 2001. The 
collected materials were identified by Prof. Ahmad El-Oqlah, plant taxonomist, Department of Biological 
Sciences, Faculty of Science, Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan. Voucher specimens of C. tunicatum (PHC 
#101) and C. hierosolymitanum (PHC #102) were registered and deposited at the Herbarium Museum of the 
Faculty of Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan. 
The plant raw material of C. tunicatum was divided into four parts: corms, stems, leaves, and roots; while for C. 
hierosolymitanum it was divided into three parts: flowers, stems, and corms. The clean-divided plants parts 
were air-dried at room temperature with the corms sliced into small pieces to speed up their dryness. After 
drying, their exact weights were recorded. The plant parts were grounded to powder using a laboratory mill. 
Powdered material was maintained at room temperature (22-23°C), protected from light until required for 
analysis. 
3.3. Extraction and fractionation  
   
The ground plant materials of C. tunicatum (633 g leaves, 171 g stems, 1433 g corms, and 83 g roots) and C. 
hierosolymitanum (650 g corms) were extracted exhaustively with MeOH and then filtered (MeOH fraction), 
and the filtrate was dried under reduced pressure via a rotary evaporator. Fractionation of this crude alkaloid 
extract was carried out based on the method of im nek and coworkers 19,25,26. Briefly, MeOH fractions, 
153 g leaves, 100 g stems, 527 g corms, and 12 g roots of C. tunicatum and 80 g corms of C. hierosolymitanum 
were dissolved in 120, 37, 350, 20, and 300 mL 5% acetic acid, respectively. The acidic solutions were then 
subjected to extraction (three times) with 450, 300, 900, 75, and 450 mL petroleum ether each time, respectively 
(Fraction A). The aqueous acid residues were extracted three times with 450, 300, 900, 75, and 350 mL diethyl 
ether each time, respectively (Fraction B). The acidic aqueous solutions were then made alkaline (pH 9) with 
10% NH4OH, and then re-extracted four times with 750, 600, 1500, 150, and 450 mL dichloromethane each 
time, respectively (Fraction C). The basic aqueous solutions were adjusted to pH 12 with sodium hydroxide, 
and extracted three times with 450, 300, 900, 75, and 300 mL diethyl ether each time, respectively (Fraction D), 
and finally extracted three times with 450, 300, 900, 75, and 300 mL dichloromethane, respectively (Fraction 
E). All these fractions were brought to dryness (in vacuum) and the exact weights were recorded as the 
following:

Open glass column chromatography of fractions C, 1.169 g leaves, 0.668 g stems, and 4.47 g corms of C. 
tunicatum and 1.0 g corms of C. hierosolymitanum were carried out on silica gel 60, 0.06-0.2 mm, 70-230 
mesh, packed in n-hexane. Elution of the columns was conducted using 100% hexane gradually enriched with 
dichloromethane. The columns were then eluted with solvent mixtures of dichloromethane--methanol of 
increasing polarity. Eluted fractions were followed by TLC, and similar fractions were combined into pools. 
The pools were subjected to further purification using semi-preparative HPLC, using a gradient solvent system 
of CH3CN and 3% acetic acid in water (10 : 90-60 : 40 over 30 min) with a 10 mL min
-1
 flow rate, monitoring 
at 245 nm, and injecting between 75 and 175 mg of material dissolved in 2 mL of MeOH and mobile phase in a 
1 : 1 ratio. The purities of the isolated compounds were checked by TLC developed with either CHCl3 : MeOH 
[9 : 1] or CH2Cl2 : acetone : diethylamine [12 : 6 : 2]. 
3.4. Structural elucidation of active components  
   
The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using a series of spectroscopic and spectrometric 
techniques principally: 1D-NMR (
1
H and 
13
C) and low resolution EI-MS and APCIMS, and by comparing with 
the reported spectral data in the literature 19. An authentic standard material of (-)-colchicine, Sigma, was 
available. 
3.5. Brine shrimp lethality test  
   
The BSLT was performed as described previously 27,28. 
3.6. Human cancer cell panel  
   
A panel of three human cancer cell lines was selected 19: MCF-7 human breast carcinoma (Barbara A. 
Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, MI), NCI-H460 human large cell lung carcinoma (American Type Culture 
Collection, Manassas, VA), and SF-268 human astrocytoma (NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program, 
Frederick, MD) cell lines were all adapted and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal 
bovine serum (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 10% (v/v) and the antibiotics, penicillin G (100 U mL
-1
) and 
streptomycin sulfate (100 µg mL
-1
) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere kept at 37°C. Strict attention was paid 
to using cells in the logarithmic phase of cell growth, and fresh cell stocks were expanded at the end of 20 
passages to maintain continuity of results during fractionation and compound purification. 
Cell suspensions were first prepared at densities of 3000 (MCF-7), 1500 (NCI-H460), or 10,000 (SF-268) cells 
per 50 μL of medium for each well of 96-well culture dishes and plated in triplicate for each drug concentration. 
Plant extracts, fractions, and pure compounds were dissolved in DMSO initially at 4 mg mL
-1
, then diluted in 
culture medium at twice the intended final concentration. Fifty microliters of each 2  drug solution was then 
added to wells containing an equal volume of each cell suspension. For initial screening and fractionation 
samples, cells were exposed to fractions at final concentrations of 2 and 20 µg mL
-1
; for EC50 determinations, 
pure compounds were diluted serially in half-log steps. In all cases, the final DMSO concentration was ≤0.5%. 
Blank wells and wells with media but no cells were included for background correction since trichloroacetic 
acid (TCA)-precipitated proteins from serum alone results in some background sulforhodamine B (SRB) 
absorbance. After a three-day continuous exposure, cells were fixed by addition of 25 μL of cold 50% (w/v) 
TCA to the growth medium in each well at 4°C for 1 h, then washed five times with water. The TCA-fixed cells 
were then stained for 30 min with 50 μL of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% (v/v) acetic acid followed by five rinses with 
1% (v/v) acetic acid to remove unbound dye. The fixed, stained plates were air-dried and bound dye then 
solubilized by incubation with 100 μL of 10 mM Tris base for at least 5 min. Absorbance was measured at 540 
nm using a Tecan Ultra multiplate reader. The percent cellular survival was calculated as the fractional 
corrected absorbance of drug/extract-treated samples relative to control cells treated with vehicle alone: (sample 
OD540 - media blank OD540/mean control OD540 - media blank OD540) 100. For EC50 calculations, survival 
data were evaluated by variable slope curve-fitting using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). 
4. Conclusions  
   
C. tunicatum Feinbr and C. hierosolymitanum Feinbr (Colchicaceae), two unexplored native Jordanian meadow 
saffrons, were studied phytochemically. Directed by the BSLT, five and four known compounds were isolated 
and identified from C. tunicatum and C. hierosolymitanum, respectively. These compounds were tested for 
general toxicity against the BSLT and for cytotoxicity against a human cancer cell panel. (-)-Colchicine (I) and 
(-)-cornigerine (III) were found to be the most bioactive.
