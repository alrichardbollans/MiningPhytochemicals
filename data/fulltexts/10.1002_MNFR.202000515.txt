Nash, Hazel Sharp, and John Draper*Scope: Metabolites derived from specific foods present in urine samples canprovide objective biomarkers of food intake (BFIs). This study investigated thepossibility that calystegines (a class of iminosugars) may provide BIFs forpotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) product exposure.Methods and results: Calystegine content is examined in published datacovering a wide range of potato cultivars. Rapid methods are developed forthe quantification of calystegines in cooked potato products and human urineusing triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The potential of calystegines asBFIs for potato consumption is assessed in a controlled food interventionstudy in the United Kingdom and validated in an epidemiological study inPortugal. Calystegine concentrations are reproducibly above the quantificationlimit in first morning void urines the day after potato consumption, showing agood dose-response relationship, particularly for calystegine A3. The design ofthe controlled intervention mimicks exposure to a typical UK diet and showedthat neither differences in preparation/cooking method or influence of otherfoods in the diet has significant impact on biomarker performance.Calystegine biomarkers also perform well in the independent validation study.Conclusion: It is concluded that calystegines have many of the characteristicsneeded to be considered as specific BFIs for potato product intake.1. IntroductionAfter the major cereals rice, wheat and corn, potato tubers(Solanum tuberosum L.) are the most widely consumed starchyfood internationally.[1] In addition, potato contributes significantamounts of vitamins (including vitamin C), minerals (includingDr. M.

Althoughhigher intakes of potatoes have beenlinked to increased rates of obesity, dia-betes, and cardiovascular disease in somestudies,[2] it is probable that any suchassociations were due to the fat addedduring cooking. Despite being a staplecomponent of the diet in many countriesglobally, the impact of potato consump-tion on human health is relatively poorlyunderstood.[2] Potato tubers contain arange of potentially toxic substances in-cluding glycoalkaloids and the starch inpotatoes is largely indigestible withoutprocessing and cooking.[3] In additionto domestic processing including peel-ing, blanching, baking, and frying of rawtubers to produce chips (French fries),roasted potatoes, jacket potatoes, andboiled/mashed potatoes, a wide rangeof processed potato products are avail-able commercially. Many of these pro-cessed foods are based on reconstitutedpotato and show considerable composi-tional differences from the raw tuber.Additionally, potato is a common component of ready-made com-plexmeals.

However these methods have well un-derstood limitations as a result of substantial misreporting andbias,[4] which is often exacerbated in those who are overweightor obese.[5,6] It has been demonstrated recently that metabolitesderived from specific foods or food groups present in urine sam-ples can provide biomarkers of dietary exposure.[7–11] Includingmeasurement of biomarkers of food intake (BFIs)[12,13] couldovercome some of the limitations of traditional dietary assess-ment methodologies by providing additional objective estimatesof food exposure.[14]A recent literature review exploring possible biomarkers ofpotato tuber intake[15] identified derivatives of polyphenol sec-ondary metabolites (including chlorogenic acids) in urine fol-lowing exposure to potato tuber products, but none could beconsidered specific to potato consumption. Similarly, a range ofcompounds resulting from the heating of potato products (in-cluding alkyl pyrazines, acrylamide and acrolein) were found inurine, but again a specific association with general potato con-sumption was considered unlikely. Several studies suggested thatthe well-known potato glycoalkaloids: alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine, may providemore specific biomarkers of potato expo-sure. However, potato glycoalkaloid content was generally mea-sured only in plasma or serum samples,[16–18] with no reports oftheir presence in urine. Although certainly specific to potato, theuse of these compounds as general biomarkers of potato expo-sure may prove problematic as the glycoalkaloid content is con-fined largely to the skin and because concentrations increasedramatically after tuber “greening” caused by post-harvest ex-posure to light and wounding.[19,20] This characteristic distribu-tion and response to environment means that consumption ofpotato-based foods that include the outer layers of the tuber willresult in exposure to much higher levels of glycoalkaloids thanthat achieved after eating products derived from peeled potatoes.Furthermore, since higher concentrations of these toxins in foodproducts is considered undesirable cultivar selection; agronomicpractices, and storage and processing protocols are designed tolower the concentration of glycoalkaloids in potato-based foodproducts.[19]Calystegines are a family of nortropane alkaloids (a class ofiminosugars) found largely in solanaceous plants,[20–23] wherecommon forms include calystegines A3 and B2 (Data S1, Sup-porting Information). Calystegines were first detected in potatoesin the 1990s and, although not toxic to humans, may have po-tential to reduce glucose absorption resulting from inhibition ofglycosidase enzymes.[24–26] Potato calystegines, in particular, mayhave benefits in stabilizing glucocerebrosidase which is deficientin Parkinson’s and Gaucher’s diseases.[27] Analytical methods forthe determination of calystegines in plant-derived samples havebeen reviewed recently.[23] Because of their highly polar nature,earlier analytical approaches included a purification step usingion exchange columns followed by concentration by either freezedrying or rotary evaporation prior to derivatization and analysisby gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Morerecently, measurement of calystegines in plant extracts has beensimplified by the use of liquid chromatography coupled to massspectrometry (LC-MS) which avoids the need for purificationand derivatization steps.[20,28] Concentrations of calystegines varyamong potato cultivars and, although lacking extensive study,calystegines appear to be distributed relatively evenly throughoutpotato tubers but with slightly higher concentrations in thepeel.[21,22,29,30] Unlike glycoalklaloids, calystegine metabolismis generally not influenced by postharvest exposure of potatotubers to wounding or light.[20]To date, there are no reports of human food interventions thathave studied the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of potatocalystegines and so the utility of this class of compounds as po-tential urinary BFIs for potato tuber exposure has yet to be in-vestigated. In the present study, we surveyed calystegines con-centrations in a range of potato genotypes reported in previousstudies. Rapid and sensitive micro-scale LC-MS/MSmethods forthe analysis of calystegines in cooked potato products and humanurine have been developed and used to examine their potentialas biomarkers of potato tuber consumption in both a controlledfood intervention and an epidemiological study.2. Results2.1. Calystegine Content of Uncooked Potato TubersThe impact of potato genetics on calystegine content was as-sessed by review of data reported in current literature (Table 1).The major iminosugars were found to be calystegine A3 and ca-lystegine B2 in each potato cultivar tested when converted intothe same format (mg kg−1 DW).[22,29,30] The estimated mean con-centrations of total calystegines ranged from 150 to 475 mg kg−1DW in studies carried out in different countries, with an averageof content of 296 mg kg−1 DW.2.2. Development of a Sensitive, Small-Scale LC-MS/MS Methodfor Quantifying Calystegines in Cooked Potato Products andHuman Urine Based on Triple Quadrupole TechnologyDue to their highly polar nature, the separation and detec-tion of calystegines within mixtures of chemical standardswas examined using hydrophilic interaction high pressureliquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Chro-matographic behavior of calystegines A3, B1 and B2 chemicalstandards showed good separation between A3 and B1/B2 iso-mers although in all case the peaks were broad and showedevidence of tailing typical of HILIC-MS (Data S3A–C, Support-ing Information). However, there were insufficient retentiontime differences between isomers B1 and B2 when applying spe-cific MRM parameters for respective characteristic transitionsQ1:176.081–Q3:112.185 and Q1:176.081–Q3:97.137 (Table 2,Data S3A–C, Supporting Information). Since calystegine B2is the most abundant of all B isomers, it was decided to addcalystegine B2 alongside A3 to the calibration standards and usethe strongest transitions Q1:176.081–Q3:140.191 as a commonquantifier for potentially all calystegines B isomers (Data S3D,E,Supporting Information). Calibration curves for calysteginestandards showed very good linearity in the concentration rangefrom 0.0065 to 100 µg mL−1 (Data S4, Supporting Information).The limit-of-quantification (LOQ) and limit-of-detection (LOD)Mol.

Samples of cooked potatoproducts identical to those prepared by participants in the MAINstudy[31] were assessed for calystegine A3 and B isomer contentby the above MRM methodology (Figure 1). The levels of bothcalystegine A3 and B isomers in cooked intact tubers with skinson were at the higher end of the concentration range measuredin fresh potato tubers, indicating minimal losses resulting fromcooking. Processed potato products generally had a lower calyste-gine content, related to their lack of skin tissue and percentagetuber content.The applicability of calystegine quantification was then testedusing selected urine samples from previously reported stud-ies with different levels of potato consumption.[32,31] Chro-matographic behavior of calystegines A3 and the mixture ofB isomers in representative urine samples the day after con-sumption of varying portion size of potato are shown inFigure 2.2.3. The Concentrations of Calystegines A3 and B Isomers inUrine Are Related to Potato Exposure Level in an Acute FoodInterventionWe have recently described a dietary exposure biomarker discov-ery and validation strategy based on a food intervention studyinvolving free-living individuals preparing meals and collectingurine samples at home.[31] The study design took into accountmajor sources of likely variance, including the impact of differ-ent food formulations and cooking methods and using meal pat-terns that mimic those encountered in a typical UK diet.[32] Anal-ysis of the intervention menus[32] identified days on which thestudy cohort were exposed to meals containing potato products(Data S2, Supporting Information). In preliminary experimentsa mastermix of FMV urine samples representing high exposureto potato products was analyzed by Triple Quadruple LC-MS/MSto determine which of the calystegines could be detected withoutinclusion of a urine fractionation or concentration step. Only ca-lystegine A3 and a peak representing a mixture of calystegine Bisomers (predominantly calystegine B2) were detected in dilutedurine samples and thus further analysis was limited to these twotarget compounds using purified A3 and B2 as calibration stan-dards. Calystegine A3 was detected at levels ranging from 0.020µg mL−1 to 2.75 µg mL−1 whilst the range of calystegine B iso-mers was slightly lower with a maximal concentration of 1.03 µgmL−1 (Figure 3 and data shown in Data S5, Supporting Informa-tion). Urine concentrations correlated with potato exposure levelsfor both biomarkers, particularly calystegine A3 (Figure 3; Spear-man coefficient 0.64, p-value <0.001). Study participants wereexposed to several types of potato products and cooking meth-ods (microwave chips, boiled new potatoes, baked jacket potato,potato waffles, and oven chips). The average concentration of to-tal calystegines in FMV urines was close to 0.004 µg mL−1 pergram of potato consumption for all potato-based food products(Table 3).Low levels of calystegines have been reported in other solana-ceous foods including tomato,[33] as well as aubergine andpepper[28] which might limit their use as a specific biomarkerof potato exposure. Both tomato and pepper products were alsoconsumed as components of the six menu plans of the MAINstudy including a chicken tikka curry containing tomato puree,baked beans in a tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, and beef Bolog-nese containing tinned tomatoes, and raw red and yellow pepper(Data S2, Supporting Information).

FMV urine samples from participants that hadavoided consuming potato-containing food products for 48 hcontained very low levels of both calystegines. Analysis of post-prandial urines revealed a steady increase in the concentrationof both calystegines with time during the intervention day withlevels still elevated in FMV the next day. Calystegine levels werehigher in FMV urine samples on the intervention day from par-ticipants who had only avoided potato-containing foods for 24 h.Mol. Nutr.

Calystegines Are Potential Biomarkers of Potato ProductExposure in a National Survey of Nutritional Consumption andPhysical ActivityStudy participants (n = 95) in the IAN-AF study[34] were assignedinto four potato consumption categories (see Data S7, Support-ing Information: none, n = 26; small, n = 32; medium, n = 18;and large, n= 19) using the FSA “food portion sizes” guide) basedon 24 h dietary data. Calystegine A3 was present at approximatelytwice the concentration of Calystegine B isomers in all samples(Data S7, Supporting Information). The concentration of calyste-gine A3 measured in FMV urine samples correlated with expo-sure level of potato products (Spearman = 0.46; p-value 0.003:Figure 5). The same participants were also assigned to expo-sure groups in relation to tomato, pepper and aubergine products(none, small, large) and urine samples screened for the presenceof calystegines (Data S6B, Supporting Information). Unlike forpotato exposure, there was no significant relationship betweenthe levels of tomato, pepper, and aubergine consumption and thelevels of calystegines in the urine.3. Discussion3.1. Impact of Genotype on Calystegine Content of Potato TubersFor calystegines to have value as BFIs for potato it is impor-tant to understand the likely impact of the source of potatoon calystegine content. The methods of reporting the quantityof calystegines in potato tubers differs considerably betweeninvestigations. For example, from a sampling perspective, someMol. Nutr.

Calystegine A3 concentration in first morning void (FMV) urinefollowing differential exposure to dietary potato products in an epidemio-logical study.reports provide quantities for all individual calystegine isomers(e.g., ref. [28]) in fresh uncooked tubers from a wide variety ofinternational sources, but provide no information with regard togenotype. Other researchers[20] havemeasured the concentrationof just the most abundant potato calystegines (A3 and B2 andB4) in fresh uncooked tubers and provide data on inter-cultivarvariability. The concentrations of the main potato calystegines(A3 and B2) in freeze-dried uncooked tuber tissue from specificcultivars has also been reported.[22,29,30] When data are expressedon the same basis, the estimated mean concentrations of totalcalystegines range from 150 to 475 mg kg−1 DW in studiescarried out in different countries (Table 1). As there is no overlapin the potato genotypes selected for inclusion in each of thesestudies the origin of this diversity is difficult to evaluate butmay reflect differences in measurement methods, or effects ofclimate or agronomic practices or simply to the differences incultivar preferences in individual countries. Previous reportshave suggested that tuber peel contained higher concentra-tions of calystegine compared to medulla and cortical tissues;which may be related to the retention of “sprout” tissues inthese samples.[21,22,29,30] Although the present data revealedthat neither food processing or cooking methods significantlyaltered calystegine levels in potato-containing food products,it was noticable that calystegine concentrations were higherin foods which retained tuber skins (Figure 1). Preliminaryanalysis of early-harvested “salad” potato varieties (Gemsonand Belina) which are normally consumed without peelingcontained significantly higher concentrations of calystegines(data not shown).Consistent with the present data, the majority of studiesshowed that the most abundant calystegine in potato tubers,across all cultivars, is B2 followed by A3, with ratios of B2/A3 re-ported to range from 1.7 to 6.4 in the United States[22] to 0.9–2.3in the United Kingdom.[29] In contrast, in some studies calyste-gine A3 appeared more abundant than B2 in potatoes.[20,28] Al-though these latter studies both used LC-MS analysis,[20,28] ratherthan more widely used GC-MS technology, these differences aremore likely to be related to themethodology used to extract potatotissues (Data S8, Supporting Information). From a physicochem-ical perspective, A3 contains only three hydroxyl groups as com-pared to four hydroxyl groups in B2 so that the polarity of theextraction medium is likely to affect the relative efficiency of ex-traction of the different isomers. Although this requires moredetailed investigation, it would appear that the ratio of B2/A3 re-covered after extraction increases from acetonitrile, to methanoland to water-based extraction, resulting in a trend for calyste-gine A3 content to decrease and calystegine B2 to increase (DataS8, Supporting Information). Against this background of differ-ent measurement methodology, it remains a possibility that theratio of specific calystegines may differ systematically betweengenotypes. Although calystegine A3 on its own performed wellas a biomarker of potato intake in the United Kingdom and Por-tuguese studies, we suggest it will be prudent to explore alsothe performance of total calystegines content to validate the fu-ture utility of calystegines as potato tuber exposure biomarkersin other populations.3.2. Measurement of Calystegines in Urine SamplesHighly polar compounds such as calystegines are not well sep-arated by conventional reverse phase chromatography, but hy-drophilic LC-MS (HILIC) methods have proved successful in do-ing so (reviewed by Romera-Torres et al.[23]). Good chromato-graphic separation of calystegines A, B, and C isomers from anextract of potato tubers was demonstrated utilizing a Luna NH2HILIC column but all four calystegine B isomers coeluted ina single peak.[33] We have reported recently the simultaneousmeasurement ofmultiple dietary exposure biomarkers in humanurine samples using a combination of reverse phase and HILICchromatography.[32,31,35] Using a similar p-HILIC column (ZIC)to measure calystegines in diluted urine samples, we demon-strated that comparable characteristics were evident in terms ofelution order and separability. Importantly, routine quantifica-tion was achieved without interference with the measurement ofother targeted dietary exposure biomarkers. Since calystegines A3and B2 are themain isomers found in potatoes, a lower chromato-graphic resolution resulting in only two respective peaks (A3 andB isomer calystegines) for routine biomarker quantification onZIC p-HILIC should be adequate.3.3.

In a controlled interven-tion study, the lowest calystegine A3 concentrations observed inurine collected the day after potato consumption were all at least×10 fold greater than the LOQ. In addition, although generallypresent at lower concentrations than for A3, the concentrationsof B isomers were all in the quantifiable range (Data S5, Support-ing Information and Figure 3). Examination of excretion kineticsdemonstrated a steady rise during the day of consumption andsignificant carry over of calystegine from one day to the next (Fig-ure 4), suggesting that both post-prandial and FMV urine sam-ples were suitable for biomarker measurement. Additionally, thestudy design[31] allowed a direct comparison of calystegine con-centrations in FMV urine after consumption of three differentpotato products all consumed at the same meal time on differ-ent days (Data S5, Supporting Information and Table 3) in ei-ther medium (microwave chips) or large (oven chips or boiledpotatoes) portion sizes. When expressed as the amount of totalcalystegines per milliliter of FMV urine per gram of potato prod-uct consumed the previous day, the values for all three differentpotato formulations was on average 0.004 µg mL−1. It should benoted that potato consumption was not always excluded in theMAIN study on the day prior to the potato product intervention(Data S5, Supporting Information). However, on day 1 duringthe dietary intervention study (Menu 5, Data S2, Supporting In-formation), participants consumed potato products twice duringthe day (potato waffles at breakfast and jacket potatoes at dinner),but yet again the average level of total calystegines in the nextday FMV urine per gram of potato product was 0.004 µg mL−1(Table 3).We suggest that these data highlight the value of using urinesamples from the MAIN study[31] (which was designed to mimica typical UK diet) in combination with the quantitative measure-ment simultaneously of a panel of biomarkers to validate the real-world performance of candidate BFIs.[12,13]There is evidence that peel samples from uncooked maturepotatoes may contain higher concentrations of calystegines thanin the cortex and medulla regions of the tuber.[29,30] The presentdata support this suggestion. However, in the present study, wedid not find that consumption of cooked potato products con-taining peel (such as the new potatoes and jacket potatoes) re-sulted in significantly higher calystegine levels in FMV urine (Ta-ble 3). These observations indicate that differences in prepara-tion/cookingmethod or assay sensitivity should have little impacton biomarker performance. Indeed, with correlation coefficientsclose to, or greater than 0.5 (Figure 3), the dose response betweenquantity of potato consumed and calystegine concentrations inFMV urine are good. The Portuguese epidemiological study provided an opportunity to examine dose responsiveness in relationto self-reported estimates (24 h, multiple pass dietary recall) ofpotato intake at an even a wider range of consumption levels (Fig-ure 5) and again calystegine A3 performed well.A noticeable trend in the intervention study was the numberof outliers outside of the top quartile in the “large” potatoportion size intervention group (Figure 2). In addition, themean calystegine concentration in FMV urine of participantsconsuming a “large” portion of potato products was higher in theintervention group (≈0.4 µg mL−1) than in the epidemiologicalsurvey (≈0.25 µg mL−1). These differences could reflect thefact that prescribed amounts of potato were consumed in theintervention study whereas, in the observational study, partic-ipants over-estimated their intake of potato products. Furtherinvestigation (Supplemental data 3) revealed that the majority ofparticipants classified as “large” consumers of potato products inthe intervention study also reported consuming potato productson the day before the intervention. These data again confirmthat ingested calystegines (A3 in particular) might not be fullyexcreted until at least 24–36 h after consumption. Such potentialsequestration of calystegines within the tissues leading to slowerelimination from the body would be a useful property for abiomarker of habitual exposure in studies limited to collectionof FMV spot urine samples. Further support for this suggestionarises from the fact that baseline concentrations of calystegine inparticipants classified as “none” fell into a range that overlappedwith that found in participants classified as “medium” levelconsumers. Again dietary records showed that many of theseindividuals had eaten potato products the previous day. Sincefood products and complex meals containing potatoes are avery common part of the UK diet, most individuals will havemultiple exposures to potato during a typical week and this factwill need to be taken into account when considering the use ofcalystegines as a BFI in relation to criteria suggested recently.[13]3.4. Specificity of Calystegines as Potato Tuber BiomarkersSeveral studies have reported the presence of calysteginesin other solanaceous foods in addition to potato including,aubergine, bell peppers, and tomato.[26,28,33] There is also recentreports of calystegines in the Brassicacae,[36] but not in any foodspecies. Although calystegines found in urinemay also reflect ex-posure to other types of food products, there are several lines ofevidence that suggest they are relatively specific to potato prod-uct intake in the present study. In terms of overall contribution, ithas been reported themean content of calystegines in potatoes tobe at least 8× higher than that reported for aubergine and in thelimited number of bell peppers analyzed, only trace amounts ofcalystegines were detected.[28] Similarly, calystegines have beendetected in fresh tomato and tomato products, but levels werevery low.[33] In the present study, we did not find a positive cor-relation between exposure to tomato, bell pepper, or auberginesand the calystegine content of urine. In relation to habitual diet,the relative contribution of different foods to the calystegine con-tent of urine will also be related to the frequency of exposure tothe different foods. Data from theUKNational Diet andNutritionSurvey (NDNS) Years 1–3[37] revealed that potato was consumedby 2847 of the 3073 volunteers (93%), tomato (including puree)was consumed by 99% of the volunteers, bell peppers were con-sumed by 28% of the volunteers and aubergine only 1%. For theUK population, the majority of any calystegine signal in urinewill likely be derived from potato exposure.4. Concluding RemarksA scheme of factors to be considered for the critical assessmentof BFI has been outlined recently.[13] The present data suggestthat calystegines, and particularly calystegine A3, score highlyMol.

Validation characteristics of calystegines as biomarker of potatointake using the scheme devised for biomarkers of food intake (BFI’s) crit-ical assessment.[13]Plausibility Calystegines occur at high levels in potato tubers andalthough not absolutely specific are much higher inpotato than other foods, such as aubergine, whichare eaten much less frequently.Dose-response We show a good dose-response relationship in acontrolled intervention study at different intakelevels of foods in the context of normal (complex)meals and eating patterns.Time-response Excretion kinetics demonstrate that urine samplestaken either late on the day of consumption or as afirst morning void will be suitable for calysteginequantification. Calystegine levels are almost anorder of magnitude above the quantification limitin first morning void urines in both interventionaland epidemiological studies. There appears to beno metabolism of calystegines (searched forglucuronide and sulfate biotransformationproducts in LC-MS data).Robustness We have recently described a dietary interventionstudy designed specifically to mimic the eatinghabits of the UK population[32,31]; participants wereprovided with food products and four day menus toallow them to prepare and consume meals in theirown homes in the context of a normal UK eatingpattern (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Calysteginelevels in urine reported the intake of potatoproducts when presented in different formulationsand using different cooking methods that arecommonly encountered in the United Kingdom.The levels of calystegines in potentiallyconfounding foods (such as aubergine) are muchlower and they are very infrequently consumed incomparison.Reliability Calystegine biomarkers compare well with both menucomposition and eating compliance records in anintervention study and align well with 24 h recalldietary data in an epidemiological study.Stability Calystegines seem largely unaffected by a range offood processing and cooking methods.Calystegines, like the majority of imino-sugarsappear very stable in urine samples after storagetimes of 5 years or more.Analyticalperformance andreproducibilityCalystegine measurement by HILIC LC-MS has beenshown to be feasible as part of a complex panel offood intake biomarkers in present study. Long termanalytical performance and reproducibility iscurrently being assessed in several cohort studies.on many validation characteristics (Table 4) and should be con-sidered as strong candidates for biomarkers of potato productintake.4. Experimental SectionEthical Approval: The MAIN Study was approved by the East Mid-lands - Nottingham 1National Research Ethics Committee (14/EM/0040).For the potato biomarker kinetics study, a favorable ethical opinion wasobtained following review by the Aberystwyth University Research EthicsPanel. For the epidemiological study, ethical approval was obtained fromthe National Commission for Data Protection, the Ethical Committee ofthe Institute of Public Health of the University of Porto and from the Eth-ical Commissions of each one of the Regional Administrations of Health.All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was carriedout in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Food Intervention Study Design and Urine Sampling: The MAIN(Metabolomics at Aberystwyth, Imperial and Newcastle) Study at Newcas-tle included two controlled food intervention studies in free-living popu-lations who consumed the test foods as part of two 3-day menu plans,equating to six different menus (experimental period 1, n = 15 where53% female, all non-smokers, age range = 22 to 63; experimental pe-riod 2, n = 36 where 58% female, all non-smokers, age range = 19 to 77years).[32,31] Multiple potato products were consumed over the six differ-ent menus[31] including, microwaved chips (100 g), new potatoes boiledwith skins (200 g), potato waffles (116 g), baked jacket potato (200 g), andoven chips (170 g) (Data S2, Supporting Information). The portion sizesof the selected potato products were defined as small, medium, or largewith reference to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) “food portion sizes”guide. A “large” portion was defined as >1.5 times the FSA medium por-tion size and a “small” portion size as<0.5 times the FSAmedium portionsize.[38]Urine sampling methods were implemented based on the previousstudies[39,40] and participants were asked to collect a series of urine sam-ples including the first morning void (FMV) the day after each menu plan.Potato Consumption Biomarker Excretion Kinetics: Participants (n = 7,29% female, all non-smokers, age range = 25 to 66) were recruited andasked to continue consuming their habitual diet, but to omit potato con-taining products for 24–48 h prior to the study day. On the interventionday after this washout period, they were asked to collect a first morningvoid (FMV) urine at home and store at 4 °C. Participants consumed apacked lunch consisting of a jacket potato (200 g), baked beans, mixedleaf salad, banana, and diet lemonade. They then collected post-prandialurine samples every 2 h until bed-time and a FMV urine sample the nextday. Participants were allowed to consume ameal lacking potatoes of theirown choice on the evening of the intervention day if desired.Urine Sample Preparation: Urine samples were prepared and adjustedas previously reported.[32,31] In brief, all urine samples were normalized byrefractive index prior to analysis to account for differences in fluid intakeby participants and to ensure all that all MS measurements were madewithin a similar dynamic range within the linear range of the instrument.Samples were defrosted overnight in a 4 °C fridge, centrifuged (600 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C), placed on ice and aliquots of thawed urine (1000 µL)was transferred into labeled 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. The remaining sam-ples were returned to a −20 °C freezer. An OPTI Hand Held Refractometer(Bellingham Stanley Brix 54 Model) was used to record the specific gravity(SG). Based on these figures, aliquots of the required amounts of urinefrom centrifuged 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and ultra-pure (18.2 Ω) H2O weretransferred into new tubes for extraction; this ensured that all samples hadthe same refractive index.Epidemiological Study and Urine Sampling: The study participants (n= 95) were volunteers who participated in the Portuguese National Food,Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (IAN-AF), whose aims and meth-ods were described previously.[34] A 24 h dietary record was collected bytrained nutritionists using the “eAT24” Software which facilitates the as-sessment of dietary data using an automated multiple-pass method (fivesteps).[41] All foods, including beverages and dietary supplements, con-sumed were recorded per eating occasion and quantified and describedas eaten. A recipe module was also created, in which the recipes weredisaggregated into raw ingredients allowing the description and quan-tification of each item including potato). A FMV urine sample was col-lected in a 500 mL container and kept refrigerated (4 ºC). Samples werealiquoted: 1 × 45 mL (in 50 mL Falcon pre-labeled tube) + 10 × 1.5 mL(in 2 mL pre-labeled microtubes). These aliquots were refrigerated im-mediately before being moved to −80 ºC storage, within 24 h, untilanalysis.Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2020, 2000515 © 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH GmbH2000515 (9 of 11)www.advancedsciencenews.com www.mnf-journal.comChemicals and Reagents for LC-MS/MS: Methanol (primer trace anal-ysis grade, Fisher Scientific, UK) was used for urine extraction and stan-dards preparation. Acetonitrile (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific,UK), methanol (HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific, UK), and ammonium ac-etate (Optima LC-MS grade, Fisher Scientific, Belgium) were used forpreparing the LCmobile phase. Water was ultra-pure water (18.2Ω) drawnfrom an Elga Purelab flex water purifier system (Taiwan). Chloroform (forHPLC stabilized with Amylene, Fisher Scientific, UK) was used for potatoproduct extraction. Calystegines A3, B1, and B2 standards were providedby PhytoQuest (Aberystwyth, UK) at 95% GC-MS purity.Potato Product Cooking and Sample Preparation for LC-MS/MS: Thepotato products for calystegine analysis that were consumed in the inter-vention study (Section 2.2) were cooked in a domestic kitchen as describedpreviously.[31] Briefly, the microwave chips were microwaved at full powerfrom frozen for 3 min. New potatoes were cooked by boiling in tap waterfor 15 min until soft using the cooker hob, leaving skins on. Potato waffleswere oven baked (220 °C) from frozen until crisp and golden. The jacketpotatoes were microwaved at full power from frozen for 5 min. The ovenchips were oven cooked (220 °C) from frozen until crisp and golden. Af-ter allowing to cool samples of potato products were stored at −20 °C in50 mL falcon tubes; for both jacket potatoes and boiled new potatoes thepotato peel comprised at least 30% of the samples. The % dry weight ofeach potato product was determined after freeze drying. For each potatoproduct ≈100–200 mg of frozen tissue were placed into 2 mL Eppendorftubes (×3 replicates) containing a 4 mm steel ball bearing, then immedi-ately flash frozen. The final weight of each sample was recorded. Batches ofsamples were processed in a Mixer Mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH) for 30 sat 30Hz, then 1mL of extraction solvent (2:5:2 chloroform:methanol:ultra-pure water) added to each tube. Samples were vortexed for 10 s and thenthen agitated at 1400 rpm, at 4 °C, for 20 min to extract metabolites. Afurther 150 µL of methanol was added to each tube (to avoid phase sepa-ration) which was then vortexed and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm, for 6 minat 4 °C. 50 µL of the supernatant was then diluted with 450 µL of 70:30ultra-pure water:methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, and 5.55 µg mL−1of 4-chloro-dl-phenylalanine as an internal standard. Themicro-extractionmethod was validated by determining the recovery of calystegines aftersuccessive extractions of cooked potato products and subsequent quantifi-cation of calystegines. 90% of total extractable calystegines were obtainedafter the first extraction; a further two extractions led to an increase in 9%of total calystegine content. All calystegine measurements were made onthe first extract and subsequently data were corrected for recovery.Development of Methodology for Quantification of Calystegine Content inUrine and Cooked Potato Products: Urine samples were prepared and an-alyzed as reported previously.[31] Briefly, specific gravity adjusted urinesamples were diluted 1 in 10 with water:methanol (70:30, v:v) contain-ing 0.1% formic acid and 5.55 µg mL−1 of 4-chloro-dl-phenylalanine asan internal standard. Extracts of cooked potato products were preparedas outlined in 2.9. Quantification of calystegines was performed on a TSQQuantumUltra triple quadrupole (QQQ)mass spectrometer (Thermo Sci-entific), equipped with a heated electro-spray ionization (HESI) sourceand coupled to an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific). Hydrophilicinteraction liquid chromatography (HILIC) chromatographic separationwas achieved on a ZIC-pHILIC column (polymeric 5 µm, 150 × 4.6 mm,Merck). The mobile phase consisted of A) 10 mm ammonium acetatein water:acetonitrile (95:5) and B) 10 mm ammonium acetate in wa-ter:acetonitrile (5:95). A linear gradient program was used from 95% Bto 20% B in 15 min at a flow rate of 400 µL min−1. The solvent flow wasincreased at 15.01 min to 500 µL min−1 and held constant for 5 min. Thecolumn was then equilibrated at 95% B for 5 min. Column oven and au-tosampler tray were maintained at 60 and 14 °C, respectively. To ensureconsistent sample delivery, 20 µL were injected using a 20 µL loop andpartial loop injection mode. After each injection, the syringe and injectorwere cleaned using a 10%HPLC grade MeOH solution in ultra-pure water(1 mL flush volume) to avoid sample carryover. Spectra were collected at ascan speed of 0.010 s. A scan width of 0.010m/z, and peak width (Q1, Q3)of 0.7 FWHM were used. Mass spectra were acquired in multiple reactionmonitoring (MRM)mode, in positive and negative ionizationmode simul-taneously. MRM transition as well as values for shimmer offset, collisionenergy, and tube lens were optimized automatically using Quantum TuneMaster (V1.5SP1, Thermo Scientific).Absolute concentrations were calculated using a nine-point calibrationcurve (0.006561–100 µg mL−1) for each calystegine. Xcalibur (V3.0.63,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used for peak integration, calibration,signal-to-noise estimation, and quantification. Raw files (ThermoFisher)were converted to mzML[42] using msconvert in the ProteoWizard toolkit.[43] Briefly, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) chromatograms wereextracted using the R librarymzR and peak areas were calculated by extract-ing pre-defined retention time windows (based on calibration standards)around the peak apex. For each calibration standard, a quadratic equationwas used to model the relationship between peak area and concentration.A squared fit of log10-transformed peak area values accommodated bestthe wide concentration range for biomarkers in high and low consumers,without compromising accuracy and normal distribution requirements forregression analysis. Reproducibility of measurement was determined us-ing the relative standard deviation (RSD) of a multicomponent calibrationstandard containing calystegines and an external urine QC sample usinga “master mix” of pooled samples as previously reported.[32,31] Each dailybatch of samples subjected to MRM analysis contained 15–20% calibra-tion and QC samples.The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of ca-lystegines A3 and B2 within chemical standard mixes were calculated asthe lowest concentration of each biomarker giving a signal-to-noise ratioof 3:1 and 10:1, respectively.Correlations between portion size and biomarker concentration in urinewere estimated using Spearman’s rank correlation. Students t-test was ap-plied to the highest and lowest portions and biomarker concentration. Inall instances, values were first log10 transformed.Supporting InformationSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or fromthe author.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the participants in Newcastle and Portugal for theircommitment in the food intervention and dietary survey studies, respec-tively.
