Abstract
Background: In folklore, some people take the decoction of Calyx seu Fructus Physalis (CSFP) for lowering blood
lipids. The present study is designed to evaluate the lipid-lowering activities of CSFP, and search for its
pharmacodynamical material.
Methods: CSFP was extracted by water and 75% ethanol, respectively. The extracts of CSFP for reducing serum lipid
levels were evaluated on mouse model of hyperlipidemia. The optimized extract was subjected to the bioactivity-
guided fractionation in which the liquid-liquid extraction, collumn chromatography, the in vivo and in vitro models of
hyperlipidemia were utilized. The structure of active component was determined by
13 C-NMR and
1H-NMR.
Results: The 75% ethanol extract of CSFP decreased the serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels in
mouse model of hyperlipidemia. Followed a separation process for the 75% ethanol extract of CSFP, the fraction B
was proved to be an active fraction for lowering lipid in vivo and in vitro experiments, which could significantly
decrease the serum TC and TG levels in mouse model of hyperlipidemia, and remarkably decrease the increase of
TG in primary mouse hepatocytes induced by high glucose and the increase of TG in HepG2 cells induced by oleic
acid. The fraction B2, isolated from B on bioactivity-guided fractionation, could significantly decrease TG level in
HepG2 cells. One compound with the highest content in B2 was isolated and determined as luteolin-7-O-beta-D-
glucopyranoside by NMR spectra. It could significantly reduce the TG level in HepG2 cells, and inhibited the
accumulation of lipids by oil red O stain.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the 75% ethanol extract of CSFP could improve in vitro and in vivo lipid
accumulation. Luteolin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside might be a leading pharmacodynamical material of CSFP for
lowering lipids.

Hyperlipidemia, also known as hyperlipoproteinemia or
high cholesterol, is caused by abnormal lipid and lipopro-
tein metabolism, which is a disorder characterized by
abnormally high concentration of lipids (fats) in the blood
that are correlated with the development of atherosclerosis,
the underlying cause of coronary heart disease (CHD) and
stroke [1]. Some evidence indicates that lipid-lowering
treatment can reduce progression of coronary atherosclero-
sis [2]. Many medicinal plants have been found to be useful
to successfully manage hyperlipidemia [3,4]. Calyx seu
Fructus Physalis (CSFP), a commonly used Chinese herb, is
the dried persistent calyx or the persistent calyx with fruits
of physalis alkekengi L. var. franchetii (Mast.) Makino. The
herbal preparations of CSFP are traditionally used to treat
cough, sore throat, abscesses, and urinary problems. Cur-
rently, several pharmacological effects are reported such as
antimicrobial [5], anti-inflammatory [6], antitumor [7], and
so on, which might attribute to those identified compounds
such as physalins, flavones, alkaloids, and so on [8]. The
decoction of CSFP is believed to be useful as an antihyper-
lipidemic preparation. However, a survey of the literature
revealed no hypolipidemic studies of this plant. The objec-
tives of this study were to i) prepare and screen the active
hypolipidemic extracts using animal models of hyperlipide-
mia, ii) isolate and demonstrate the active fraction(s) on
bioactivity-guided separation, iii) identify and elucidate the
underlying pharmacodynamical material.

HPLC and isolated by column chromatography. As
shown in Figure 4c, B2-1 (50 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL) and B2
(50 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL) had statistically-significant effect
to decrease the TG content in HepG2 cells, compared
with the model control group. Moreover, the effect of
B2-1 (50 μg/mL) was better than the effects of B2-1 (10
μg/mL) and B2 (50 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL).

The results suggested that it might be a flavone. The
result of molish reaction revealed that it might be a gly-
coside. Its structure (Figure 6) was determined by NMR

basically consistent with the data of luteolin-7-O-beta-
D-glucopyranoside in the literature [9]. Thus, B2-1 was
identified as luteolin-7-O-beta-D- glucopyranoside.
Discussion
The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been advo-
cated for over 2,500 years by prescriptions, which is a
unique medical system assisting the ancient Chinese in
dealing with disease. Typically, TCM is well known for
its formulae, which usually consist of several types of
medicinal herbs. It is believed that, at least in some med-
icinal herbs, multiple components could hit multiple tar-
gets and exert synergistic therapeutic efficacies [10,11].
However, essential compounds from medicinal herbs
have not been identified in most formulae, thus hamper-
ing the modernization of TCM. Much attention has been
paid in the research on extracting active fractions or
compounds from medicinal herbs to elucidate pharmaco-
dynamical material bases during the past decades.
In folk medicine, the decoction of Calyx seu Fructus
Physalis (CSFP) can be used to lower blood lipids.
Although several kinds of compounds, such as physalins,
flavones, and alkaloids, have been identified in this medic-
inal herb, there is no such study on evaluating the lipid-
lowering pharmacotheraputic action, or elucidating the
pharmacodynamical material bases. The present study was
undertaken to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of
CSFP, and search for the lipid-lowering fraction and com-
pound. In order to evaluate the ethanolic and aqueous
extracts of CSFP for antihyperlipidemic activity, the mouse
model of acute hyperlipidemia was set up by intraperito-
neal injection of egg yolk. The results showed the
increases in serum TC and TG levels induced in hyperlipi-
demic mice were prevented by prior administration of the
75% ethanol extract (TE).
In order to elucidate the active fractions and compo-
nents, a bioactivity-guided separation on the 75% etha-
nol extract was performed. Firstly, the 75% ethanol
extract was divided into fraction E, fraction B and frac-
tion W by liquid-solid extraction. The primary mouse
hepatocytes induced by high glucose and HepG2 cells
induced by oleic acid were employed as the in vitro
screening models for lipid-lowering activity. The results
showed that the lipid-lowering activity might attribute
to the fraction B, which were confirmed by the in vivo
experimental results of acute hyperlipidemic mice. The
results demonstrated that the lipid-lowering response of
HepG2 cells were consistent with primary mouse hepa-
tocytes and acute hyperlipidemic mice. HepG2 cells
were used in subsequent experiments.
In order to isolate and identify its pharmacodynamical
material bases, the fraction B was divided further into
Part B1, Part B2, Part B3 and Part B4 by macroporous
adsorbent resins column chromatography. The screening
experiment for lipid-lowering fractions was reproduced
in HepG2 cells induced by oleic acid. The results
demonstrated that Part B2 had significant effect to
decrease TG level in HepG2 cells. The maximal

Page 4 of 8chromatographic peak was detected in 3D chromato-
gram of Part B2 by HPLC, and its peak area was up to
80% of total peak area at 350 nm. The main component
(B2-1) was isolated from Part B2 by silica gel and polya-
mide column chromatography, and identified as luteo-
lin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside by
1HN M Ra n d
13C
NMR, which significantly decreased the TG level in
HepG2 cells.
Calyx seu Fructus Physalis contains many kinds of fla-
vones, such as luteolin, ombuine, luteolin-7-O-beta-D-
glucopyranoside, luteolin-4’-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside,
quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7,4’-di-
O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and so on [12,13]. It is
reported that many flavonoids have lipid-lowering effects
[14,15]. Luteolin has been reported to reduce the accu-
mulation of lipids in HepG2 cells [16]. Luteolin-7-gluco-
side may improve lipid profiles in rats [17]. All those
informations support a hypothesis that the flavones in
Calyx seu Fructus Physalis might be lipid-lowering phar-
macodynamical material bases. In our experiments,
luteolin-7-O-beta-D- glucopyranoside remarkably
reduced the increase of TG in HepG2 cells induced by
oleic acid. So it was demonstrated that luteolin-7-O-beta-
D- glucopyranoside might be one of major lipid-lowering
components of Calyx seu Fructus Physalis.
In addition, high intrahepatic levels of TG and choles-
terol do not necessarily correlate with high serum levels
of these lipids. But the body can reduce serum levels by
increasing hepatic lipid uptake from the serum and/or
decreasing secretion from the liver. There is an argu-
ment for the utility of the cell systems for screening
lipid-lowering compound. So it is necessary to evaluate
the active compound (luteolin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyrano-
side) in animal model in future, to verify the validity of
the cell-based assays predicting in vivo effectiveness.

Page 5 of 8Conclusion
Our study clearly demonstrated that 75% ethanol extract
of Calyx seu Fructus Physalis inhibited in vitro and
in vivo lipid accumulation. In addition, luteolin-7-O-
beta-D-glucopyranoside might contribute to lipid-lower-
ing activities. We suggest that 75% ethanol extract of
Calyx seu Fructus Physalis has high therapeutic poten-
tial for prevention of hyperlipidemia. However, clinical
trial in hyperlipidemic patients is necessary in future.

Laboratory Animals published by the US National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised
1996). HepG2 cells (Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
were purchased from Cell Resource Center of Shanghai
Institute for Life Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Daming capsule, as positive hypolipidemic drug in animal
experiments, was purchased from Harbin Yida pharma-
ceutical Co., Ltd, China. Daming capsule (a traditional
Chinese formula) was composed with Radix et Rhizoma
Rhei, Semen Cassiae, etc. and used to treat hyperlipoide-
mia in clinic [18]. The kits for TC and TG were pur-
chased from Bio Sino Bio-technology and Science Inc.,
China. The oleic acid was purchased from Sigma. The
cell lysis buffer and BCA Protein Assay Kit were pur-
chased from Beyotime. The mammalian protease inhibi-
tor was purchased from Shanghai Biocolor BioScience &
Technolgy company.
Plant material
Calyx seu Fructus Physalis, purchased from the Medic-
inal Material Company of Shiyitang in Harbin, China,
was identified as the persistent calyx of physalis alkekengi
L. var. franchetii (Mast.) Makino by Dr. Guoyu Li of Har-
bin Medical University. A voucher specimen of CSFP
(Registration number: JDL-20090826) was deposited in
the herbarium of Harbin Medical University.
Extraction and isolation
CSFP (100 g) were extracted with water (3 × 1000 mL, 3 h
each) at 80°C to give the total water extract (TW, 26 g,
26%). CSFP (1000 g) were extracted with EtOH-H2O
75:25 (3 × 10000 mL, 3 h each) at 80°C to give the total
75% ethanol extract (TE, 208 g, 20.8%). TE (165 g) was
extracted by ethyl acetate (2 × 1000 mL, 2 h each), n-buta-
nol (2 × 1000 mL, 2 h each) and water (2 × 1000 mL, 2 h
each) at 80°C, respectively. The corresponding extracts
were obtained, such as part E (20 g, 12%), part B (45 g,
27%) and part W (100 g, 61%). Part B (18 g) was subjected
to macroporous resin column (D101, 6 × 50 cm, flow rate
4 mL/min, Chemical Plant of Nankai University) using a
step gradient of EtOH-H2O 0:100 (4 L), 30:70 (4 L), 60:40
(4 L) and 97:3 (4 L). Fractions of 4 L were collected and
they were B1 (3.2 g), B2 (5 g), B3 (4 g) and B4 (2.3 g),
respectively. B2 was analyzed by HPLC (Agilent 1200 Infi-
nity Series, USA) on a C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm,
Nacalai Tesque, Japan) eluted with MeOH-H2O 50:50 at
1 mL/min. A compound (B2-1) with the highest content
in B2 was detected in the 3D chromatogram of HPLC and
the tR of B2-1 was 7.4 min. The compound B2-1(35 mg)
was isolated from B2 (4 g) on polyamide column (48-75
μm, 3 × 30 cm, Chemical Plant of Shanghai) and silica gel
column (38-75 μm, 2 × 25 cm, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical
Co., Ltd). The chemical structure of B2-1 was determined
by NMR spectra (Bruker AVANCE 300, Switzerland). The
samples of cell experiments were dissolved in the ddH2O
with 4% DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO was
0.1% in culture medium.
Mouse model of hyperlipidemia
After the extracts were orally administrated to KM mice
once per day for 7 days, the mice were intraperitoneally
injected with 75% yolk emulsion (20 ml/kg) for making
mouse model of acute hyperlipidemia except for the
control group. Twenty hours later, the blood sample
was drawn from abdominal aorta, centrifugated and col-
lected supernatant. The contents of TC and TG in
serum were determined by kits.
For evaluating the lipid-lowering effects of 75% etha-
nol extract of CSFP, fifty-six male KM mice (28-32 g)
were randomly divided into seven groups: control
group, model control group, TW (1 g/kg/d), TW (2 g/
kg/d), TE (1 g/kg/d), TE (2 g/kg/d) and positive control
drug group (0.5 g/kg/d, Daming capsule).
For evaluating the lipid-lowering effects of part E and
p a r tB ,f o r t ym a l eK Mm i c e( 2 8 - 3 2g )w e r er a n d o m l y
divided into five groups: control group, model control
group, E group (2 g/kg/d × 12% = 0.24 g/kg/d), B group
(2 g/kg/d × 27% = 0.54 g/kg/d) and positive control
drug group (0.5 g/kg/d, Daming capsule). The dosages
of E and B were correlated with their extraction rates.
Preparation of primary mouse hepatocytes
Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated by Seglen two
steps perfusion method [19]. At first, the mouse was
anaesthetized by pentobarbita. The peritoneal cavity was
opened, and the portal vein was catheterized. The liver
was perfused (5 mL/min, 37°C) with the perfusate (137
mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4,0 . 4 4m M
KH2PO4,4 . 2m MN a H C O 3, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM

was perfused again with the perfusate (0.5 mg/mL col-
lagenase, 137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.34 mM
Na2HPO4,0 . 4 4m MK H 2PO4,4 . 2m MN a H C O 3,

7.5). After the digestion, the liver was put into culture
medium, cut into pieces and filtrated. Filtrate was cen-
trifugated (1 min, 700 rpm and 4°C), and the superna-
tant was removed. Culture medium was added into the
centrifuge tube, and the cells were resuspended by
repeated pipetting. The density of the cells was adjusted
to be 2.5 × 10
5 cell/mL by supplementing culture med-
ium. Finally, the cells were transfered into 96-well plate
and cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under a humi-
dified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
High glucose induced up-regulation of TG on primary
mouse hepatocytes
Our experiment had testified that the TG content of pri-
mary mouse hepatocytes in high-glucose culture medium
was 2 ~ 3 times than that in low-glucose culture medium.
The results showed that the high-glucose condition pro-
moted hepatocytes to produce more TG. The primary
mouse hepatocytes were cultured at high-glucose condi-
tion in 96-well plate, and then treated for 48 h with TE,
E, B and W, respectively. The cells were washed with
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in
ddH2O and disrupted by ultrasonication. The TG con-
tent in cells was determined by kits.
Oleic acid induced up-regulation of TG on HepG2 cells
The lipid composition of HepG2 cells was close to that of
normal human liver cells. It was used as cell model for
lipid-lowering research. The cells were cultured in high-
glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% peni-
cillin-streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. After the cells adhered and grew in 6-well plate, the
oleic acid with the final concentration of 500 μMw a s
added into culture medium to stimulate cells to produce
more TG as model cells [20]. The control group cells were
cultured without oleic acid. The HepG2 cells were treated
for 48 h with different fractions, respectively.
Measurement of TG content in HepG2 cells
HepG2 cells in 6-well plate were washed with cold PBS,
and then digested by trypsin. After the cells were centri-
f u g a t e da t1 0 0 0r p mf o r3m i n ,t h es u p e r n a t a n tw a s
removed and the cells were washed with PBS. The cells
were centrifugated again and the supernatant was
removed, and then the cells were added into 400 μLo f
isopropanol at 4°C for 2 h. After the isopropanol solution
was centrifugated (16000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C), the super-
nate was evaporated until dry. The residua were added
into 20 μL of isopropanol, then to determine the TG con-
tent by kits [21]. The sediment of centrifugation at 16000
rpm was added into 40 μLo fc e l ll y s i sb u f f e rw i t h1 %
mammalian protease inhibitor, disrupted by ultrasonica-
tion and centrifugated (13500 rpm, 15 min, 4°C). The
content of protein in supernate was determined by BCA
Protein Assay Kit. The intracellular TG content was
represented as μg/mg cell protein.
Oil red O stain
For examination of fat accumulation in HepG2 cells, the
cells were treated for 48 h with different fractions of
CSFP. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and fixed in
10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After the cells were
washed with 60% isopropanol, the cells were stained for
at least 1 hour in a freshly diluted Oil Red O solution
(six parts Oil Red O stock solution and four parts H2O;
Oil Red O Stock solution is 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropa-
nol) [22]. After the stain was removed and the cells were
washed with 60% isopropanol, the image of each group
was photographed.
Statistical analysis
All the data were expressed as mean ± standard devia-
tion (SD). Data were statistically analyzed by one-way
ANOVA, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test to
determine differences between groups. All statistical
analyses were performed with SPSS 13.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Values of p <0 . 0 5w e r e
regarded as significant difference.
