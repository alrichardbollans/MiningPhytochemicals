Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting approximately 
33.5 million people worldwide. Aging is the main risk factor associated with AD. Drug discovery 
based on nutraceutical molecules for prevention and treatment of AD is a growing topic. In this 
sense, carotenoids are phytochemicals present mainly in fruits and vegetables with reported 
benefits for human health. In this research, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of three carotenoids, 
cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide, and zeaxanthin, was assessed. Cryptocapsin showed the 
highest bioactivity, while cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide and zeaxanthin exhibited similar activity on 
anti-aggregation assays. Molecular modeling analysis revealed that the evaluated carotenoids 
might follow two mechanisms for inhibiting Aβ aggregation: by preventing the formation of 
the fibril and through disruption of the Aβ aggregates. Our studies provided evidence that 
cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide, and zeaxanthin have anti-amyloidogenic potential 
and could be used for prevention and treatment of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting approximately 
33.5 million people worldwide, with 5 million new cases every year.1,2 Aging is the 
main risk factor associated with AD, and the prevalence of the disease has been 
estimated from 0.6% to 8.4% in people at ages between 65 and 85 years.3 Clinical 
features of this neurodegenerative condition include slow loss of memory and reason-
ing skills, speech abnormalities, and disorientation.3–5 The disease culminates in the 
complete custodial care of the patient and finally death, which is usually caused by 
pneumonia.3 The presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular Aβ 
senile plaques in the brain is a pathological feature of AD.6,7 Aβ is produced by the 
cleavage at the beta site of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase. 
This cleavage leads to the formation of a small soluble APP-β and C-99 fragments, 
which in turn are broken down by the enzyme γ-secretase, generating an insoluble Aβ
42
 
peptide, which polymerizes and deposits in the brain as senile plaques.7,8 Metabolic 
imbalance produces increased quantities of Aβ, thus favoring the formation of amyloid 
fibrils in the brain, which leads to neuronal cell death.4 Aβ stimulates the production of 
neurotoxic reactive oxygen species and brain inflammation that contribute notably to 
the advancement of multifactorial AD.9,10 Consequently, Aβ aggregates are significant 
targets in the development of new therapeutical approaches for AD.

Several investigations have revealed that compounds 
present in food hold neuroprotective properties, and play a 
significant role in the prevention of different neurodegenera-
tive disorders.11–15 Carotenoids are phytochemicals present 
in fruits, some of which (close to 50) are essential in human 
nutrition due to their provitamin A properties.16 Accumu-
lating evidence indicates that these isoprenoid compounds 
prevent or ameliorate human diseases such as eye disor-
ders, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.16,17 Nevertheless, 
the effect on brain bioactivity of these compounds has 
been poorly studied, particularly in AD.15,18 Owing to the 
chemical nature of carotenoids and their ability to cross 
the brain membrane and accumulate in neural tissues, these 
compounds have great potential to act as functional agents 
for AD prevention and treatment. The physicochemical 
properties of carotenoids such as presence of keto κ-rings 
(eg, cryptocapsin and cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide) and β-rings 
(eg, zeaxanthin) might provide to these compounds the 
potential to prevent the formation of Aβ aggregates, or to 
disrupt these aggregates. This paper provides data on the 
anti-amyloidogenic activity of carotenoids containing keto 
κ-rings and β-rings.
Materials and methods
samples and isolation of carotenoid 
standards
Pouteria sapota (mamey) was obtained from the metro-
politan public market in Panama, while Aiphanes aculeata 
(corozo fruit) was collected directly from the tree. Carote-
noid standards were extracted and isolated from the fruits 
according to recommended procedures.19,20 Five hundred 
grams of P. sapota pulp and A. aculeate were homogenized 
separately with 50 g of NaHCO
3
 and extracted exhaustively 
with acetone. A solution of Et
2
O/n-hexane and distilled water 
were added to the acetonic extract. The organic phase was 
concentrated and dried over sodium sulfate (Na
2
SO
4
), then 
diluted with Et
2
O, and saponified with methanolic KOH. 
The saponified mixture was then washed with water, con-
centrated, and dried over Na
2
SO
4
. The crude extract of each 
fruit was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography using 
aluminum oxide (Brockmann grade III) as the stationary 
phase and increased percentages of ethyl ether in n-hexane as 
the eluent. All reagents and chemicals used for this research 
were of analytical grade.
high performance liquid chromatography-
diode array detection analysis
Further purification of the carotenoids was achieved by high 
performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection 
on an 1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 
equipped with a diode array detector and a quaternary pump. 
A YMC C30 column (250×10 mm, 5 μm) was used as the 
stationary phase. Elution of the compounds was done by 
means of two solutions (eluents): solution A consisting of a 
mixture MeOH/MTBE/H
2
O (81:15:4) and solution B con-
sisting of a mixture of MeOH/MTBE/H
2
O (6:90:4). A linear 
gradient of 100% of solution A (0 min) to 50% of solution 
A and B (45 min) at 2 mL/min was used.
Carotenoid characterization
Carotenoids were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). 1H, 13C NMR spectra 
were recorded at 400 (1H), 100 MHz (13C) on an Eclipse 
400 MHz spectrometer (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA). 
Chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million from the 
residual solvent peak and coupling constant (J) in Hz. Proton 
multiplicity is reported in singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), 
quartet (quart), quintet (quint), septet (sept), multiplet (m), 
and broad (br). The molar mass for each compound was 
measured in a micrOTOF/QIII mass spectrometer (Bruker 
Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA), in atmospheric chemical ion-
ization (APCI)-positive mode, scanning from 200 to 700 m/z. 
A complete description of the carotenoid characterization by 
NMR and MS is described in Supplementary information.
Aβ42 aggregation assay
The aggregation of Aβ
42
 was assessed by Thioflavin T assay. 
Aβ
42
 recombinant peptide (rPeptide) was resuspended in 1% 
NH
4
OH at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. A concentration of 
10 μM of rAβ
42
 was combined with or without different 
concentrations of each carotenoid (1, 3, 10, and 30 μM). 
A volume of 200 μL of the mixture was plated in a 96-well 
plate. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Then, 
20 μM of Thioflavin T (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the 
fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (synergy 
HT BioTek) with a wavelength of 450 nm for excitation and 
485 nm for emission. Curcumin (5 μM) was used as the posi-
tive control. All reactions were performed in the presence of 
0.1% of dimethyl sulfoxide, which was used as diluent for the 
compounds. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50
) 
was established by adjusting the sigmoidal dose–response 
curve following GraphPad Prism 5 procedure.
In silico molecular modeling
Molecular docking studies with the carotenoids (ligands) were 
carried out on the fibril structure of Aβ
42
 (PDB ID-2BEG) 
comprising 5 Aβ
42
 proteins retrieved from the Protein Data 
Bank. The simple monomer of the beta-fibril model of Aβ

Anti-amyloid aggregation activity of novel carotenoids
was used as the receptor for docking calculations. Preparation 
of the target peptides and ligands, visualization of data 
structures, ligand minimization, and docking analysis were 
carried out using the CDOCKER protocol in Discovery 
Studio 3.5 software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA). 
CDOCKER is a grid-based molecular docking methodology 
that uses CHARMm force fields. Docking exercises were 
conducted to critically evaluate the extend of binding of the 
ligands with Aβ
42
 and to establish their relative strengths.21
Results
Identification of carotenoids
Fractionation and isolation of the carotenoids from the 
extracts of P. sapota and A. aculeata fruits were com-
pletely achieved by column chromatography using different 
 eluents. Two carotenoids, cryptocapsin and cryptocapsin-5, 
6- epoxide presenting a keto κ-ring at one end of the molecule, 
bearing hydroxyl groups, were isolated from the extracts of P. 
sapota fruit. The presence of these carotenoids in P. sapota 
fruit was identified earlier by Murillo et al.20,22 On the other 
hand, zeaxanthin, a carotenoid bearing only β-ionone hydrox-
ylated rings, was isolated from A. aculeata extract. This 
carotenoid was previously reported in A. aculeate fruit.16,23 
Further purification of the isolated compounds was accom-
plished by high performance liquid chromatography using 
a C-30 column. The chemical nature of each carotenoid was 
fully determined by NMR and MS techniques as described 
in Supplementary material. The chemical structures of the 
isolated carotenoids are presented in Table 1.
Anti-amyloidal activity of carotenoids
In this investigation, Thioflavin T assay was used to evalu-
ate the anti-amyloidogenic activity of cryptocapsin, cryp-
tocapsin-5,6-epoxide, and zeaxanthin. All the carotenoids 
studied exhibited bioactivity in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Cryptocapsin showed higher bioactivity (IC
50
 =1.97 μM), 
while zeaxanthin and cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide showed 
comparable bioactivity (IC
50
 of 2.29 μM and 2.53 μM, 
respectively) (Table 1 and Figure S1).
Molecular docking of carotenoids
In order to get more insights on the anti-amyloidogenic 
activity of the carotenoids, the molecular interactions by 
which these compounds inhibit Aβ aggregation were studied 
by performing molecular modeling. This analysis is based 
on determination of protein–ligand binding is progressively 
being used for discovery of new drugs.24 So far, there has 
been no report on the use of molecular modeling for identify-
ing carotenoids as potential Aβ inhibitors. For modeling the 
interactions between the protein (receptor) and the ligands, 
the receptor is held rigid, while the ligands are allowed to 
flex during the refinement to specify the ligand placement in 
the binding domain. Ligand energy minimization was car-
ried out in a vacuum, and the peptides were pre-processed 
separately by energy minimization values. Structural details 
for Aβ structure and energy-minimized ligands are displayed 
in Figure 1. Aβ is a short peptide with 42 residues that bears 
two amyloidic areas, one at sequence 16–21 (amyloidic 
region 1) and the second sequence at 32–36 (amyloidic 
region 2).25 For this modeling, only residues from 17 to 42 
were considered as the amino acid sequence from 1 to 16 is 
unstructured (Figure 1A).
Investigations of the protein/ligand complex models, rep-
resented in Figure 2, were based on three criterions: binding 
energy, interacting amino acid residues, and bond distance 
of Aβ protein with each ligand. Results of these docking 
parameters are tabulated in Table 2.
Discussion
Carotenoids have the potential to play a significant role in 
the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
such as AD.18 Investigations of the effect of carotenoids 
on Aβ plaques formation or disruption are limited.18,26 
Amyloid aggregation is a key factor in the pathogenesis 
of AD, thus preventing the polymerization of monomers, 
and has therapeutic potential. Most of the drug discovery

studies are focused on prevention of amyloid aggrega-
tion both at preclinical and clinical levels.4 Therefore, we 
studied the anti-amyloidogenic properties of cryptocapsin, 
cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide (both keto κ-ring carotenoids), 
and zeaxanthin (β-ring carotenoid). Thioflavin T assay 
showed that all the three carotenoids inhibit Aβ aggregation 
in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular modeling was 
performed for achieving more insights on the possible 
mechanism of inhibition. The carotenoids here investigated 
have high bond-free energies (Table 2), which indicates that 
they bind tightly with Aβ

 inhibiting aggregation, therefore 
confirming Thioflavin T assay results. The ketone group

Anti-amyloid aggregation activity of novel carotenoids
of cryptocapsin forms hydrogen bonds with the peptide at 
Glu22 and Asp23, while Gly25 interacts with the hydroxyl 
group of the κ-ring. Cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide has a very 
similar structure with that of cryptocapsin, differing only in 
the presence of a 5,6 epoxy group in the molecule (Table 1), 
yet it binds differently to the peptide by interacting with 
both amyloidic regions of Aβ forming hydrogen bonds at 
Leu17, Phe19 (amyloidic region 1), and Gly33 (amyloidic 
region 2). This hydrogen bonding is produced by interac-
tion of the hydroxyl group at the κ-ring with Leu17 and 
the ketone group with Phe19, whereas the epoxy group at 
the six-membered ring interacts with Gly33. We hypoth-
esize that differences in the structure of these keto κ-ring 
carotenoids are key in the mode by which they inhibit the 
formation of amyloid fibrils. The interactions of ligands, 
such as cryptocapsin, at no-amyloidic sites of Aβ have 
been associated with disruption and disaggregation of the 
beta-sheet fibril structure.27 Moreover, ligands such as 
cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide that bind to amyloidic regions 
prevent association of Aβ inhibiting the formation of beta-
fibril.27 Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid that has one hydroxyl 
group at each β-ionone ring. One of these hydroxyl groups 
interacts with two amino acids of Aβ (Val39 and Ile41), 
while the hydroxyl group placed on the other β-ionone 
ring interacts with Gly25. Neither of these amino acids 
is present at amyloidic sites; so, it is very likely that this 
carotenoid may lead to disintegration of beta-fibrils. A 
earlier study showed that the presence of hydroxyl groups 
in the chemical structure of carotenoids is crucial for anti-
amyloidogenic activity.18 Further, the polyene backbone 
in carotenoids inhibits the formation of Aβ fibrils through 
hydrophobic interactions.18,26
The beneficial role of carotenoids to human health due 
to their therapeutic properties is widely known.17,28 There 
are limited studies on clinical intervention of carotenoids in 
aging and age-related diseases.17,29 In general, the level of 
carotenoids in food is low. Modest concentrations of zeaxan-
thin have been found in the serum of individuals consuming 
a diet rich in corn.30 Hence, the potential of zeaxanthin as 
an agent against AD is important since these levels would 
not be achieved by food intake. On the other hand, there is 
no report in the literature about the concentrations in serum 
of cryptocapsin and cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide. This is the 
first report attributing a biological activity for both caro-
tenoids. At this point, our data, and other studies, indicate 
preliminary information on the possible beneficial role of 
carotenoids in AD.
Conclusion
Healthy aging and related disorders are a growing concern 
worldwide. Clinical intervention for the prevention or treat-
ment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders through 
nutraceutical molecules is a growing topic. Our study pro-
vided evidence that cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide, 
and zeaxanthin have anti-amyloidogenic potential. The pres-
ent study provides a clue on the role of novel carotenoids 
as possible intervention molecules after further preclinical 
studies in Alzheimer’s animal models.
