IntroductionWithanolides are a group of naturally occurring C28-steroidal lactones built on an intact orrearranged ergostane scaffold in which C-22 and C-26 are appropriately oxidized to form aδ-lactone ring on the nine-carbon side chain. These compounds are mainly found inmembers of the plant family Solanaceae (Mirjalili et al., 2009) and are known to possessvarious biological activities including anticarcinogenic (Christina et al., 2004), antioxidant(Bhattacharya et al., 1997), adaptogenic (Dhuley, 2000), antiparkinsonism (Nagashayana etal., 2000), antibacterial (Arora et al., 2004), anti-inflammatory (Al-Hindawi et al., 1989),immunomodulatory (Davis and Kuttan, 2000) and antidepressant (Bhattacharya et al., 2000)effects. As part of our ongoing investigation of antiproliferative withanolides (Samadi et al.,2010), we selected Withania somnifera L. Dunal as an abundant source of these compounds.W. somnifera, commonly known as “ashwagandha” and widely cultivated in the drier partsof India, is well known for its use in Ayurvedic medicine. Previous research supports itspharmacological uses, confirming antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (Sumantran et al., 2008),immunomodulatory, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial (Owais et al., 2005), antiparkinsonism(Sankar et al., 2007) and antistress (Geetha and Harish, 2006) properties.

More than 130 withanolides have been reported in previousinvestigations from the same species. Herein, we report the isolation and structuralelucidation of a new chlorinated withanolide (1), named 6α-chloro-5β,17α-dihydroxywithaferin A (Fig. 1), along with other nine known withanolides.2. Results and discussionThe ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the crude extract acquired for this study was subjectedto repeated column chromatography to yield compound 1. Compound 1 was obtained ascolorless parallelepiped-shaped crystals by recrystallization from MeOH–CH2Cl2–EtOAc(5:1:1). The molecular formula C28H39ClO7 was deduced from its HRESIMS (observed m/z523.2440 [M + H]+, calcd for C28H40ClO7 523.2463) and NMR data. The presence ofchlorine was supported by the intensity of the [M + H +2]+ peak, which was approximatelyone-third as intense as the pseudomolecular ion peak [M + H]+. IR absorption bands at3500, 1700, and 1650 cm−1 revealed the presence of OH, carbonyl and lactonic groups.The 13C NMR (DEPT) spectrum of 1 displayed 28 signals which were assigned to fourmethyl, seven methylene (including one oxygenated at δ57.3), nine methine (including twoolefins at δ127.8 and 142.8), and eight quaternary carbons (including one keto carbonyl atδ200.2 and one ester carbonyl at δ167.0, two olefins at δ154.2 and 125.2, two oxygenated atδ84.8 and 78.1) corresponding to C28H35. Thus, the remaining four hydrogen atoms wereassigned to four OH groups. These data were consistent with the characteristic features ofwithanolides, C28-steroidal lactones with a δ-lactone ring on the nine-carbon side chain.The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 also showed typical signals for a withanolide. The four methylgroups resonated at δ0.99 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), δ0.78 (3H, s), δ1.27 (3H, s), and δ2.03 (3H,s), corresponding to the secondary methyl of C-21 and the quaternary methyls C-18, 19 and28 of a withanolide.The NMR data of 1 was very similar to those of another chlorinated withanolide, 6α-chloro-5β-hydroxywithaferin A 2 (Nittala et al., 1981), isolated during this study. Theobvious difference between 1 and 2 was the presence of a quaternary carbon (δ84.8) in 1 anda methine carbon (C-17) in the latter (1H NMR δ 1.07, 13C NMR δ51.8), suggesting that 1was a 17-hydroxy derivative of 2. This observation was supported by the high-frequencyshift of C-13 (δ48.3 in 1 and δ43.2 in 2), C-16 (δ36.5 in 1 and δ27.2 in 2), and C-20 (δ42.6in 1 and δ38.7 in 2) in the 13C NMR spectra. It was also supported by the 1H-1H COSY andHSQC spectra (a fragment CH3-CH-CH(O)-CH2- of the side chain linked to the oxygenatedquaternary C-17 in 1 and a fragment CH3-CH-CH(O)-CH2- of the side chain linked tomethine C-17 in 2), and the HMBC correlations (Fig. 2) between H3-21 (δ0.99) and C-17(δ84.8), between H3-18 (δ0.78) and C-17 (δ84.8) in 1. The full assignments of NMR data(Table 1) were obtained by 2D NMR including 1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra.Finally, the structure of 1 was confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffractionexperiments (Fig. 3). The absolute configuration of 1 was confirmed on the basis ofanomalous scattering of the chlorine atoms in the crystal. Thus, the structure of the newwithanolide 1 was established as 6α-chloro-5β,17α-dihydroxywithaferin A.The known compounds were identified, by comparison of their NMR and MS data withthose reported in the literature, as 6α-chloro-5β-hydroxywithaferin A (2) (Nittala et al.,1981); (22R)-5β-formyl-6β,27-dihydroxyl-1-oxo-4-norwith-24-enolide (Nittala and Lavie,1982); withaferin A, 2,3-dihydrowithaferin A and 3-methoxy-2,3-dihydrowithaferin A(Pelletier et al., 1979); 2,3-didehydrosomnifericin (Choudhary et al., 1996); withanone(Gottlieb and Kirson, 1981); withanoside IV (Matsuda et al., 2001) and withanoside XTong et al.

Full assignments of NMR data for the known chlorinated withanolide 2were listed in Table 1 because those values reported in the literature (Nittala et al., 1981)and, especially the assignments of its 13C NMR data (C-4, 6, 10, 14, 17), need to be revised.Chlorinated compounds such as 1 and 2 are not commonly encountered in higher plants. Todate, only five other chlorinated withanolides have been reported from W. somnifera,including withanolide C (Bessalle and Lavie, 1992), withanolide Z (Pramanick et al., 2008),6α-chloro-5β-hydrowithanolide D, 4-deoxyphysalolactone (Nittala et al., 1981) and 27-acetoxy-5β-chloro-6α-hydroxywithaferin A (Choudhary et al., 2010). With the exception of27-acetoxy-5β-chloro-6α-hydroxywithaferin A and withanolide Z, all the reportedchlorinated withanolides contain a 6α-chloro-5β-hydroxy system. This suggests that theepoxide rings that are usually encountered at C-5 and C-6 have undergone a diaxial opening(Nittala et al., 1981).3. Experimental3.1. GeneralOptical rotations were obtained on a Rudolph Research Analytical Autopol IV Automaticpolarimeter. Melting points were recorded using a MPA100 OptiMelt Automated MeltingPoint System (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA). UV data were acquired using anAgilent Technologies 1200 HPLC (Diode Array Detector). HPLC was conducted on AgilentTechnologies 1200 series system. IR data were obtained using a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360FT-IR instrument. NMR spectra were recorded on either a Bruker DRX-400 with a qnpprobe or on a Bruder AV-500 with a cryoprobe. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded using theresidual protonated signal in the CDCl3 solvent (δH 7.24) or the central peak of the CDCl3triplet (δC 77.00) as the internal standard. High resolution mass spectrometry data werecollected on a LCT Premier time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA).Normal phase TLC was performed on Sorbent Technologies Silica G TLC plates (200 μm,w/UV 254) using the solvent system CH2Cl2–EtOAc–MeOH (1:8:1), and reverse phaseTLC was performed on Sorbent Technologies C18 TLC plates (150 μm, w/UV 254) usingH2O-MeOH (1:1). Spots were visualized using UV light (254 nm) and spraying withvanillin-sulfuric acid reagent.3.2. Plant MaterialThe plant crude extract was acquired from PhytoMyco Research Corporation, Greenville,NC in March 2009. The extract was prepared according to published procedures bysequential extraction of the dried and ground leaves of W. somnifera with a mixture ofCH2Cl2 and MeOH (1:1, v/v) followed by MeOH and H2O to obtain three fractions(Jayaprakasam and Nair, 2003). All fractions were then combined, filtered and dried underreduced pressure. The original extract has been stored at -20 °C in our laboratory to serve asa reference material.3.3. Extraction and IsolationThe powdered, dried plant extract (189 g) of W. somnifera was dissolved in 200 mL of waterto form a suspension. The mixture was defatted with hexane (2 L × 3), and the aqueousphase was extracted with EtOAc (2 L × 6) and BuOH (2 L × 3) to obtain 32.9 g of EtOAcextract and 80.0 g of BuOH extract. The EtOAc extract was then subjected to passage over aSi gel column (600 g, 32 ∼ 63 μm, Sorbent Technologies), eluted sequentially with CH2Cl2-CH3COCH3 solvent gradient (0–100%) followed by MeOH, to give eight major fractions(Fraction A-H). Fraction F was chromatographed on a Si gel (200 g, 12 ∼ 26 μm, SorbentTechnologies) MPLC column, eluted with CH2Cl2–EtOAc–MeOH (40:10:1), to afford fourfurther fractions (F1–F4). Fraction F2 was applied onto a C-18 reverse phase column (100 g,Tong et al. Page 3Phytochem Lett. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 December 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptSorbent Technologies), eluted with MeOH–H2O (3:7) to remove the green color. Thecolorless fraction F2 was then separated on a Sephadex LH-20 column (200 g, GEHealthcare), eluted with MeOH to obtain the major components, and then purified byseparation over a Si gel column (50 g, 12 ∼ 26 μm, Sorbent Technologies), eluted withCH2Cl2–MeOH–EtOAc (18:1:1), to yield 1 (5 mg). Fraction F1 was purified on a SephadexLH-20 column (200 g, GE Healthcare), eluted with MeOH, to afford 2,3-didehydrosomnifericin (21 mg). Compound withanone (800 mg) was obtained as fineneedles by recrystallization of fraction D from CHCl3–CH3COCH3 (1:1). Fraction E waschromatographed on a Si gel column, eluted with CH2Cl2–CH3COCH3 (10:1), to collecttwelve fractions (E1–El2), and E6 was identified as withaferin A (34 mg). The majorwithanolide in fraction E7 was obtained as a white powder yielding 3-methoxy-2,3-dihydrowithaferin A (22 mg) by recystallization from CHCl3–CH3COCH3 (1:1). E12 wasseparated over a C-18 reverse phase SPE column (5 g, 20 mL, Phenoment strata C-18),eluted with MeOH-H2O (1:1), to give a mixture of two compounds. Further purification ofthe mixture by HPLC using isocratic elution with CH3CN–H2O (45:55) provided (22R)-5β-formyl-6β,27-dihydroxy-1-oxo-4-norwith-24-en (1.5 mg) and 2,3-dihydrowithaferin A (1.2mg). Compound 2 (7.3 mg) was purified from fraction E11 by a C-18 reverse phase SPEcolumn (5 g, 20 mL, Phenoment strata C-18) using MeOH–H2O (1:1).The n-BuOH extract was subjected to passage over a Si gel column (2 kg, 12 ∼ 26 μm,Sorbent Technologies), eluted sequentially with MeOH–CH2Cl2 solvent gradient (30%–100%), to give 24 fractions. Fraction 4–5 was purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column (200 g,GE Healthcare), eluted with MeOH–H2O (8:2), to afford a withanoside-rich fraction. Thisfaction was further purified by PTLC eluting with CH2Cl2–MeOH–H2O (40:10:1) and semi-prep HPLC eluting with CH3CN–H2O (25:75) to afford withanoside IV (5.6 mg) andwithanoside X (6.3 mg).3.4 6α-chloro-5β,17α-dihydroxywithaferin A (1)Colorless crystal (MeOH); mp 238-240 °C; [α]25546 +53.1 (c 0.001, MeOH); UV (MeOH)λmax (log ε) 220 (3.93) nm; IR (film) νmax 3500, 2980, 1700, 1650, 1630 and 1050 cm-1; 1HNMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) and 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) see Table 1; ESIMS m/z 523[M + H]+; HRESIMS m/z 523.2440 (calc. for C28H40ClO7, 523.2463).Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge financial assistance from the Center for Cancer Experimental Therapeutics NIH Grant5P20 RR015563-10 (to B.N.T.) and the University of Kansas fund KU 2506014-910/099 (to B.N.T.).
