Background: In the face of chronic and emerging resistance of parasites to currently available drugs and constant
need for new anti-malarials, natural plant products have been the bastion of anti-malarials for thousands of years.
Moreover natural plant products and their derivatives have traditionally been a common source of drugs, and
represent more than 30% of the current pharmaceutical market. The present study shows evaluation of anti-malarial
effects of compound conessine isolated from plant Holarrhena antidysenterica frequently used against malaria in the
Garhwal region of north-west Himalaya.
Methods: In vitro anti-plasmodial activity of compound was assessed using schizont maturation and parasite lactate
dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay. Cytotoxic activities of the examined compound were determined on L-6 cells of rat
skeletal muscle myoblast. The four-day test for anti-malarial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium
berghei NK65 strain in BALB/c mice was used for monitoring in vivo activity of compound. In liver and kidney
function test, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was examined by p-NPP method, bilirubin by Jendrassik and
Grof method. The urea percentage was determined by modified Berthelot method and creatinine by alkaline
picrate method in serum of mice using ENZOPAK/CHEMPAK reagent kits.
Results: Compound conessine showed in vitro anti-plasmodial activity with its IC50 value 1.9 μg/ml and 1.3 μg/ml
using schizont maturation and pLDH assay respectively. The compound showed cytotoxity IC50= 14 μg/ml against
L6 cells of rat skeletal muscle myoblast. The isolated compound from plant H. antidysenterica significantly reduced
parasitaemia (at 10 mg/kg exhibited 88.95% parasite inhibition) in P. berghei-infected mice. Due to slightly toxic
nature (cytotoxicity = 14), biochemical analysis (liver and kidney function test) of the serum from mice after
administration of conessine were also observed.
Conclusion: The present investigation demonstrates that the compound conessine exhibited substantial anti-
malarial property. The isolated compound could be chemically modified to obtain a more potent chemical entity
with improved characteristics against malaria.Background
Malaria is re-emerging as the world's number one killer
infection, causing approximately one million deaths an-
nually and 300–400 million infections per annum [1].
The dreaded disease is difficult to eradicate and its con-
trol is possible only with coordinated efforts of the gen-
eral public, healthcare personnel and government* Correspondence: vkdua51@gmail.com

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/12/1/194of drug resistance particularly to chloroquine and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has led to recommenda-
tions that they be replaced with artemisinin-based com-
bination therapy (ACT) for improved efficacy. On the
other hand, development of resistance to artemisinins
and their associate drugs cruelly limit the utility of ACT
in future. Consequently to develop alternative therapy,
research on anti-malarials is urgently vital. Plants used
in traditional medicines shows potential source of com-
pounds with good anti-malarial activity [4,5]. Natural
plant products and their derivatives have traditionally
been a common source of drugs, and represent more
than 30% of the current pharmaceutical market [6,7].
The continuing research directed towards discovery of
anti-malarials from plants [8-10], it was noticed that
chloroform extract of H. antidysenterica showed the
anti-malarial properties against Plasmodium falciparum
isolates and P. berghei-infected mice. Therefore, in the
present investigation the anti-malarial activity of isolated
principle compound conessine from H. antidysenterica
is demonstrated against P. falciparum isolates and Plas-
modium berghei-infected mice.Methods
Collection of plants and isolation of compound
Plants and its parts were collected during flowering sea-
son of year 2008 from Cheela range of the Garhwal re-
gion and identified by Botanical Survey of India,
Dehradun, India. Voucher specimens of the plants were
stored in the Institute herbarium (voucher specimen
number NIMRHAR-101-HA) for future reference. The
compound conessine (Figure 1) was isolated from the
bark of H. antidysenterica using the method reported
earlier [11].Figure 1 Structure of steroidal alkaloids conessine isolated
from the bark of Holarrhena antidysenterica.In vitro anti-plasmodial activity against K1 strain of
plasmodium falciparum isolates
In vitro anti-plasmodial sensitivity of compound was
assessed at National Institute of Malaria Research, New
Delhi, India using Schizont maturation method [12].
Chloroquine sensitive strain FSG of P. falciparum de-
rived from an Indian patient of Shahjahanpur (UP) was
used for the study. Culture was maintained in A +ve
erythrocytes using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with AB Rh +ve human serum (10%), sodium bicar-
bonate (0.2%), HEPES buffer (25 mM) and gentamycin
(50 μg ml-1). The culture was treated with selected con-
centrations of conessine. The prepared blood smears
were stained with Giemsa strain after 72 hrs of incuba-
tion % maturation of schizonts against positive control
was recorded. The compound was also sent to Swiss
Tropical Institute, Switzerland for screening of in vitro
anti-plasmodial activity using the parasite lactate de-
hydrogenase (pLDH) assay [13]. In parasite lactate de-
hydrogenase (pLDH) assay, chloroquine sensitive GHA
strain derived from a Ghanaian patient was used and
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
25 mM HEPES, 0.37 mM hypoxanthine, 10% A+ve hu-
man serum together with 2-4% washed human O +ve
erythrocytes and 25 mM NaHCO3. All cultures were
conducted at 37 ± 1°C and an atmosphere of 3% oxy-
gen, 4% carbon dioxide and 93% nitrogen. The sterile
384- well microtiter plates were used for performing as-
says, in which each well containing 2 μl of selected
concentration of compound solution with 38 μl of the
parasite inoculums (1% parasitaemia, 2% haematocrit).
Parasite growth was compared to control wells (100%
parasite growth). After 72 h of incubation at 37 ± 1°C,
plates were deep-frozen at −20°C. After thawing 5 μl
from each well was transferred into another plate to-
gether with 25 μl of Malstat™ reagent and NBT (Nitro
Blue Tetrazolium, 0.1 mg/ml) and 5 μl of a 1/1 mixture
of PES (phenazine ethosulfate, 2 mg/ml). The plates were
then kept into darkness for 2 h and the change in colour
was measured with a spectrophotometer (at 655 nm). In
both methods chloroquine was taken as positive control.
The inhibitory concentration value, at which 50% of the
parasites kill (IC50) was considered for anti-plasmodial
activity.
Cytotoxicity on rat skeletal muscle myoblasts (L-6 cells)
and selectivity indices (SI)
The cytotoxicity of the compound was determined using
reported method [14,15]. The cell line L-6, rat skeletal
muscle myoblasts were seeded in 96-well Costar microti-
ter plates at 2 × 103/cells/100 ml, 50 ml per well in
MEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS. A
three-fold serial dilution ranged from 90 to 0.13 mg/ml
of compounds in test medium was added. Plates with a

for 72 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and
resazurin was added as viability indicator. After an addi-
tional 2 h of incubation, the plates were measured with a
fluorescence scanner using an excitation wavelength of
536 nm and an emission wavelength of 588 nm. The IC50
values were calculated from the sigmoidal inhibition
curves with the SoftmaxPro software.
The selectivity indices (SI) were calculated with the ra-
tio of the IC50 for the L-6 cells to the IC50 for the
in vitro anti-plasmodial activity against P. falciparum
isolates.
In vivo anti-malarial activity against P. Berghei
Mouse and parasite strain
BALB/c mice (weighing 22–26 g and 4–6 weeks old) of
either sex, obtained from the central animal house, Panjab
University, Chandigarh were used as experimental models.
They were maintained on a standard pellet diet and water
ad libitum. Plasmodium berghei (NK- 65) was maintained
by intraperitoneal inoculation of 1×106 infected red blood
cells (RBCs) to native mice [16].
Ethical clearance
The treatment of mice was according to the guidelines
of committee for the purpose of control and supervision
on experiments on animals (Reg No. 45/1999/CPCSEA),
Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.
Drug used
Compound was dissolved in 70% Tween 80 and 30%
ethanol. This solution was further diluted 10-fold with
distilled water to result in a stock solution containing
7% Tween and 3% ethanol with which different con-
centrations of compound, i.e., 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and
50 mg/kg were prepared.
Experimental design
Five groups having 10 mice each (same sex and age)
were used for the present study. Groups were designated
as G-1 to G-5 (Table 1). All groups were injected withTable 1 Experimental groups for four-day suppressive

Liver and kidney function tests
Adverse effects due to the compound were examined by
liver and kidney function tests. The activity of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) was determined by p-NPP method
[18], bilirubin by Jendrassik and Grof method [19]. The
urea concentration was determined using modified
Berthelot method [20] and creatinine by alkaline pictrate
method [21] in serum of mice using ENZOPAK/
CHEMPAK reagent kits (Reckon Diagnostic Pvt Ltd,
Gorwa, Baroda, India). Serum was obtained from four
mice of each group by centrifugation of blood at 800 g
for 15 min RT. Biochemical assays were performed on
day 7 in infected control and on day 10 in treated
groups.
Results and discussion
Natural plant products have remained the eventual foun-
dation for the treatment of various ailments, including
malaria forever [8,10,22,23]. The chloroform extract of
plant H. antidysenterica was found to wield consider-
able in vitro anti-malarial activity with an IC50 value of
5.5 μg/ml against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum
isolates, during parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)
assay [9]. Therefore in the present study, the anti-malarial
activity of the principal steroidal alkaloid, conessine from
the stem bark of H. antidysenterica, was evaluated.Table 2 In vitro anti-plasmodial activity of examined

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/12/1/194Conessine was isolated from the stem bark using the
methods reported earlier [11]. The anti-plasmodial activ-
ity, cytotoxic activity and selectivity indices of conessine
are presented in Table 2. The in vitro anti-plasmodial ac-
tivity of conessine assessed by pLDH assay revealed more
reproducible value (IC50 = 1.3 μg/ml and) as compared to
the activity assessed by schizont maturation method
(IC50 = 1.9 μg/ml). The assessed cytotoxity of conessine
against a rat cell line L-6 was found IC50=14 μg/ml. While
Zirihi and co-workers [24] demonstrated in vitro anti-
plasmodial activity of conessine isolated from the plant
Funtumia elastica against chloroquine-resistant strain
FcB1 of P. falciparum with its IC50 1.04 μg/ml and
cytotoxity against a rat cell line L-6 with 14 μg/ml respect-
ively. Stephenson [25] showed that conessine had no anti-
malarial action in chicks infected with Plasmodium
gallinaceum, while in the present investigation (Table 3),
conessine was significantly reduce parasitaemia (Table 3)
compared to the activity of the same plant chloroform ex-
tracts (70% at 30 mg/kg dose) [9] and the untreated con-
trol. It was observed that compound conessine reduce
higher percentage of parasitaemia at low dose range
(88.9%, at 10 mg/kg dose on day five) as compared to high
dose range (reduce 71.6% of parasitaemia at 50 mg/kg
dose on day five).Therefore percentage reduction of para-
sitaemia was further observed on day seven and was found
high at low dose range (88.95%, at 10 mg/kg dose on day
seven) as compared to high dose range (reduce 50.99% of
parasitaemia at 50 mg/kg dose on day seven). Walker and
collaborators [26] elaborated that highly potent drug
evokes a larger response at low concentration thatTable 4 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, concentration of

are not killed by suboptimal doses or by drug concentra-
tions later on in the terminal elimination phase. Due to
which the activities in all the groups were observed to de-
crease during the follow up period. After administration of
compound conessine, the observed survival of animals
(Table 3) supported for its anti-plasmodial activity com-
pared with other steroidal alkaloids [24,27]. Due to the
slightly toxic nature (cytotoxicity = 14 μg/ml), biochemical
analysis (liver function tests and kidney function test) of
the serum of the mice after administration of conessine
was also observed and is summarized in Table 4. In terms
of pathogenesis, the host liver is among the organs affected
in the early stage of malaria [28] leading to significant alter-
ations in the host hepatocyte physiology and morphology.
Elevated levels of ALP and bilirubin are an indication of
hepatocyte damage due to malarial infection [29]. Acute
renal failure or acute kidney injury and increased levels of
creatinine and urea have been also associated with severe
falciparum and vivax malaria [30]. Biochemical analysis of
uninfected mice administered with the compound showed
that conessine affected the function of the liver and kidney
significantly as compared to normal mice (Table 4). In earl-
ier studies, chloroquine has also been reported to induce
secondary increase in the certain enzymatic activities along
with the increase in autophagy of cells exposed to chloro-
quine. Hence, this could probably justify the observed ele-
vation in enzyme activity of liver and kidney of treated
mice [31]. The administration of artemisinin is also
reported to cause a significant increase in serum aspartate

study suggest that the extract might have affected the hep-
atic and renal indices without producing cellular necrosis.
An increased level of various biochemical parameters has
been reported due to administration of various anti-
malarial drugs. Conessine exhibited strong anti-plasmodial
activity during the course of infection as compared to the
vehicle and infected control mice (Table 3). Results of the
suppressive activity exhibited a good clearance rate at low
concentration of 10 mg/kg (88.95%) (Table 3).
Conclusion
The steroidal alkaloid conessine isolated from the bark
of H. antidysentrica exhibited substantial anti-malarial
activity with slight cytotoxic nature. The isolated com-
pound could be chemically modified to obtain a more
potent chemical entity with improved characteristics or
modified compound can become preclinical candidate
against malaria.
