An investigation of Oenanthe ﬁstulosa from Sardinia afforded oenanthotoxin (1a) and dihydrooenanthotoxin (1b) from
the roots and the diacetylenic epoxydiol 2 from the seeds. The absolute conﬁguration of 1a and 1b was established as
R by the modiﬁed Mosher’s method, and the structure of 2 by chemical correlation with (+)-(3R,8S)-falcarindiol.
Oenanthotoxin (1a) and dihydrooenanthotoxin (1b) were found to potently block GABAergic responses, providing a
molecular rationale for the symptoms of poisoning from water-dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) and related plants. These
observations bear relevance for a series of historical and ethnopharmacological observations on the identiﬁcation of the
Sardonic herb and the molecular details of the facial muscular contraction caused by its ingestion (risus sardonicus).
Plants from the genus Oenanthe (Umbelliferae family) are among
the most poisonous species of the European ﬂora.
1 They bear a
general resemblance to parsnip and carrot and are still a cause of
often fatal human poisonings.
1 Sardinian Oenanthe species have a
special ethnopharmacological relevance, being considered the most
likely candidate for the (in)famous sardonic herb, a neurotoxic plant
used in pre-Roman Sardinia for the ritual killing of elderly people.
2
According to the ancient historians, elderly people unable to support
themselves were intoxicated with the sardonic herb and then killed
by dropping from a high rock or by beating to death.
2 The facial
muscular contraction induced by the sardonic herb mimicked a
smile, and the expression risus sardonicus (sardonic smile) to
indicate a sinister smile is well documented in the Latin and Greek
literature and in most modern European languages. It even found
its way into the mainstream medical lingo as the hallmark of
lockjaw (trismus), the spasm of the muscles of mastication.
3
The poisonous constituents of Oenanthe species are a series of
polyacetylenic alcohols exempliﬁed by oenanthotoxin (1a).
4 Sur-
prisingly, the absolute conﬁguration at the stereogenic carbon
(C-14) of oenanthotoxin is still unknown, and little information on
the molecular details of its neurotoxic activity has been reported.
As part of a study on poisonous Sardinian plants,
5 we have
investigated O. ﬁstulosa L. (tubular water-dropwort), a species that,
despite its very broad distribution in Europe, had so far been
overlooked in terms of phytochemical studies. Large amounts of
the diacetylene epoxydiol 2 were obtained from the seeds, while
the roots gave, along with the widespread acetylene falcarindiol
(3), oenanthotoxin (1a) and dihydroenanthotoxin (1b). The absolute
conﬁguration of 1a and 1b was clariﬁed by application of the
modiﬁed Mosher method, while the activity of oenanthotoxin was
proﬁled against GABA receptors, a target involved in the action
of many convulsivant toxins of plant origin.
6
An acetone extract from the underground parts of O. ﬁstulosa
was fractionated by gravity column chromatography to afford large
amounts (ca. 0.80% of dried plant material) of (+)-(3R,8 S)-
falcarindiol (3)
7 and a mixture of oenanthotoxin (1a) and its
dihydroderivative (1b) (0.070%).
4 Compounds 1a and 1b were
easily separated by preparative HPLC and identiﬁed by comparison
with authentic samples of (+)-oenanthotoxin and (+)-dihydrooe-
nanthotoxin obtained, in over 10-fold higher yield, from the roots
of O. crocata, a more common species in Sardinia (see Experi-
mental Section). A complete assignment of the 1H NMR resonances
of both 1a and 1b is reported in the Experimental Section.
Oenanthotoxin (1a) is isomeric with cicutoxin (4) from water
hemlock (Cicuta Virosa L.), with the only difference between these
C-17 acetylenic toxins being the position of a single double bond,
located next to the secondary oxymethine in cicutoxin and adjacent
to the primary hydroxyl in oenanthotoxin.
4b The absolute conﬁg-
uration at C-14 of cicutoxin was established as R by application of
a CD exciton chirality method on its p-methoxybenzoate, taking
advantage of the allylic nature of the stereogenic center, and was
conﬁrmed by application of the Mosher method.
8 Since the
stereogenic center of oenanthotoxin is not allylic, the Mosher
method
9 was used to assign its absolute conﬁguration.
To achieve this aim, two aliquots of oenanthotoxin (1a) were
dissolved in dry pyridine and allowed to react overnight with DMAP
and (R)- or (S)-MTPA chloride, respectively, affording the (S)- and
(R)-MTPA diesters 5a and 5b, respectively. Analysis of the ∆δ(S-R)

9 (Figure 1) allowed the assignment of the R
conﬁguration at C-14 of 1a. The same methodology was applied to
dihydrooenanthotoxin (1b), which, by analysis of the ∆δ(S-R) values
between its (S)- and (R)-MTPA diesters 6a and 6b (Figure 1), turned
out to have the same R conﬁguration at C-14. In both cases,
concomitant MTPA esteriﬁcation at C-1 did not exert any inﬂuence
on the anisotropic effect of the phenyl group of the MTPA moiety
bound to the C-14, located 13 carbons away from the primary hydroxyl.
The seeds of O. ﬁstulosa were totally devoid of oenanthotoxin-like
polyacetylenes and contained rather large amounts of the diacetylenic
epoxydiol 2. The structure elucidation of this compound (C17H24O3,
HRMS) was helped greatly by comparison with falcarindiol (3),
7 since
the two compounds showed similar spectroscopic features.
7 Thus, 2
differed from 3 only in the epoxidation of the disubstituted double
bond, as evident from the replacement of the two mutually coupled
oleﬁn protons of 3 with two oxymethine signals [δ 3.06 (dd, J ) 7.1,
4.0 Hz, H-9) and 2.80 (dt, J ) 5.9, 4.0 Hz, H-10]. Corresponding
changes were observed in the 13 C NMR spectrum (upﬁeld shift of
the C-9 and C-10 methines, now resonating at δ 57.9 and 57.4,
respectively). Full assignment of 1H and 13C NMR resonances of 2
was achieved through analysis of 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, and
gHMBC) data, which conﬁrmed that 2 is an epoxidized derivative of
falcarindiol. To further conﬁrm this assignment and establish the
conﬁguration of the epoxide ring, the reaction of (+)-(3R,8S)-
falcarindiol (3)
7 with peracids was investigated. Enines can be
chemoselectively epoxidized, and treatment of falcarindiol with meta-
chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) under controlled conditions
(monitoring of the conversion by 1H NMR analysis, see Experimental
Section) gave the epoxide 2 in satisfactory (66%) yield and as the
only reaction product. This was identical in terms of both spectroscopic
properties and optical rotation to the natural product isolated from O.
ﬁstulosa. Prolonged reaction times or the addition of NaHCO3 to buffer
the acidity of the medium led to extensive degradation of the reaction
product. The epoxidation of allylic alcohols is a syn addition, and the
peroxy acid is directed by hydrogen bonding to the allylic hydroxyl,
which, in the case of secondary alcohols, reacts in the conformation
that minimizes allylic strain (A(1,3)-strain) between the alkyl group
bound to the oxymethine and the distal substituent of the adjacent
double bond (C-7 and C-11, respectively, in the case of the epoxidation
of 3).
10 Taking into account that the stereogenic double bond of
falcarindiol has a cis conﬁguration, these considerations lead to a
9S,10R conﬁguration for the epoxide ring of 2.
11 A compound with
the planar structure of 2 and spectroscopic features compatible with
those of 2 was described from Panax quinquefolium.
12 However, the
optical rotation was different [+ 107 (MeOH) for the epoxydiol from
O. ﬁstulosa and +87 (MeOH) for that from P. quinquefolium], and in
the absence of an authentic sample, the identity of the two compounds
could not be established.
Polyacetylene neurotoxins are believed to act like biological
analogues of the sesquiterpene lactone picrotoxin, binding to the
convulsant site of GABAA receptors and causing death by inducing
convulsions and respiratory paralysis.
13 In addition, oenanthotoxin has
also been reported to dramatically affect cationic (calcium and sodium)
currents in excitable membranes.
14 We found that both oenanthotoxin
and dihydrooenanthotoxin could potently block the GABAergic
responses in neuronal cell cultures, with an EC50 value in the low
micromolar range for both compounds. Currents elicited by exogenous
GABA were recorded in the whole-cell conﬁguration by rapid
application of 3 µM GABA at the membrane voltage of -40 mV,
and a typical GABA-evoked response, recorded in these conditions,
is presented in Figure 2 (left). The effect of 1a and 1b on current
amplitude was assessed by dividing the current amplitude measured
in the presence of this drug by the amplitude value in control conditions
measured from the same cell. Oenanthotoxin (1a) clearly inhibited the
GABAergic responses in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A). A
tentative ﬁtting of the logistic equation (y ) 1/(1 + (c/Ec50)h)) to the
amplitude dose-dependence for oenanthotoxin shown in Figure 2B
yielded a EC50 value of 1.39 µM( h ) 0.59). Dihydrooenanthotoxin
(1b) exhibited a similar inhibitory activity on currents elicited by 3
µM GABA, but was slightly more potent (EC50 ) 0.835 µM, h )
0.58). The effect of both test compounds was reversible, although at
least 10 min of wash was required to restore the control responses.
Compound 1b can be viewed both as 2,3-dihydrooenanthotoxin and
as 12,13-dihydrocicutoxin (cf. 1a and 4), showing that, in polyacety-
lenic toxins, the presence of allylic double bonds is redundant for
activity and that the conjugated system required for the activity is
shorter than previously postulated,
13 encompassing four, and not ﬁve,
unsaturations.
Unlike other plant toxins, the convulsant polyacetylenes from
water dropwort and related plant do not evoke unpleasant taste
(bitter) or chemesthetic (burning) sensations, and the roots of O.
crocata, an exceedingly poisonous plant, have a paradoxical
sweetish and pleasant taste and odor.
15 The large concentration of
falcarindiol, a bitter compound,
16 and the lower contents of
polyacetylene toxins in O. ﬁstulosa when compared to O. crocata
could presumably underlie the observation that the former species
has not yet been associated with human or animal poisoning. The
name Oenanthe signiﬁes “wine ﬂower”, because the plant produces
a state of stupefaction similar to drunkenness.
1,2 This, as well as
locked jaws (risus sardonicus), has been documented in human
poisoning from O. crocata,
1,2 and there is little doubt that herba
sardonica of the ancient medical literature should be identiﬁed with
O. crocata,
2 a plant that, within the Mediterranean area, is common
only in Sardinia.
2 The results of our investigation provide a further
rationale for this identiﬁcation, proposing a molecular mechanism
for the risus sardonicus described by the ancient authors.
Neurotoxins have emerged as powerful neurochemical tools,
17,18
and the scarce attention given so far to the C-17 neurotoxic ace-
tylenes can best be explained by their chemical instability, especially
in the highly puriﬁed form required for biological studies. Thus,
oenanthotoxin (1a) and dihydrooenanthotoxin (1b), just like many
other polyacetylenes, easily turned into highly colored and insoluble
polymeric materials upon storage, even at low temperature (-18
°C). To overcome this problem, we have developed a ﬂash
chromatography protocol to separate oenanthotoxin (1a) and
dihydroenanthotoxin (1b) from a crude extract of O. crocata and
found that these compounds, while being highly unstable in the
solid state, can be conveniently stored for at least 6 months in
benzene or DMSO solution at 4 °C (see Experimental Section).
This might foster interest in this fascinating class of compounds,
with its unique capacity of dramatically perturbing calcium and
sodium ionic currents in excitable membranes
14 and speciﬁcally
interacting with ligand-gated ion channels like the GABAA receptor.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2009, Vol. 72, No. 5 963and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were measured on a Varian INOVA
spectrometer. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent
signal (CDCl3: δH 7.26, δC 77.0). Homonuclear 1H connectivities were
determined by the COSY experiment. One-bond heteronuclear 1H-13C
connectivities were determined with the HSQC experiment. Two- and
three-bond 1H-13C connectivities were determined by HMBC experi-
ments optimized for a 2,3J of 7 Hz. Through-space 1H connectivities
were evidenced using a ROESY experiment with a mixing time of 500
ms. Two- and three-bond 1H-13C connectivities were determined by
gradient 2D HMBC experiments optimized for a 2,3J of 9 Hz. Low-
and high-resolution EIMS spectra (70 eV) were performed on a VG
Prospec (Fisons) mass spectrometer. ESIMS spectra were performed
on a LCQ Finnigan MAT mass spectrometer. Silica gel 60 (70-230
mesh) was used for gravity column chromatography. Reactions were
monitored by TLC on Merck 60 F254 (0.25 mm) plates, which were
visualized by UV inspection and/or staining with 5% H2SO4 in ethanol
and heating. Organic phases were dried with Na2SO4 before evaporation.
Plant Material. Oenanthe ﬁstulosa was collected near San Basilio
(CA, Sardinia, Italy) on September 14, 2007. The plant was identiﬁed
by M.B., and a voucher specimen (171007) is held at the University
of Cagliari. O. crocata was collected near Bonacardo (Abbasanta, NU,
Italy) in May 8, 2007, and a voucher specimen (OCR080506BO) is
held at the University of Cagliari.
Extraction and Isolation. (A) Powdered, dried underground parts of
O. ﬁstulosa (608 g) were extracted with acetone (2 × 2 L) at room
temperature, affording 7.94 g of a dark oil, which was fractionated by
gravity column chromatography on silica gel (n-hexane-EtOAc, 9:1 to
6:4, as solvent gradient system). Fractions eluted with n-hexane-EtOAc
(9:1) were further puriﬁed by HPLC (n-hexane-EtOAc, 85:15) to yield
falcarindiol (3, 344 mg). Fractions eluted with n-hexane-EtOAc (6:4) were
further puriﬁed by HPLC (n-hexane-EtOAc, 65:35) to yield oenathotoxin
(1a, 68 mg) and dihydrooenanthotoxin (1b, 67 mg). (B) Powdered, dried
seeds of O. ﬁstulosa (379 g) were extracted with acetone (2 × 2L )a tr t ,
affording 21.3 g of a yellowish oil, which was fractionated by gravity
column chromatography on silica gel (n-hexane-EtOAc, 9:1 to 6:4, as
solvent gradient system). Fractions eluted with n-hexane-EtOAc (7:3) were
further puriﬁed by HPLC (n-hexane-EtOAc, 55:45) to yield epoxyfal-
carindiol (2, 432 mg). (C) Dried underground parts of O. crocata (95 g)
were extracted with acetone (2 × 1 L) to afford 3.1 g of a brownish oil,
which was puriﬁed with the Biotage SP1 system with a silica gel (10 g)
FLASH 12+M column and a n-hexane-EtOAc gradient of increasing
polarities (ﬂow rate 9 mL/min, UV detector 316 nm; fractionation mode:
volume 9 mL/fraction). Fractions 29-31 and 34-36 (n-hexane-EtOAc,
6:4) afforded about 88 mg of oenanthotoxin (1a) and 89 mg of dihydrooe-
nathotoxin (1b), respectively. These compounds were obtained as colorless
foams and could not be stored in this form. However, solutions in
hydrocarbon solvents (benzene, toluene) or DMSO could be stored for at
least 6 months at 4 °C without any apparent (1H NMR analysis) degradation
or development of a reddish color.

Epoxidation of Falcarindiol. To a solution of falcarindiol (85 mg,
0.36 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added 85% m-chloroperbenzoic
acid (MCPBA, 73 mg, 0.36 mmol, 1 molar equiv). The course of the
reaction was followed by 1H NMR analysis of a CDCl3 solution
containing an equimolecular mixture of falcarindiol and MCPBA. After
stirring2ha tr t ,t h ereaction was worked up by dilution with CH2Cl2
and the addition of silica gel (1 g) impregnated with a 5% water solution
of Na2S2O3. After stirring a few minutes, the slurry was ﬁltered and
the ﬁltrate was dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated, to afford 60 mg (66%)
of 9-epoxyfalcarindiol (2), spectroscopically (1H and 13C NMR) identical
to the natural product and having [R]D
25 +101 (c 1.1, MeOH).
Cell Culture for Electrophysiological Recordings. Neuronal cell
culture was prepared as previously described in detail by Andjus et
al.
19 Brieﬂy, P1-P3-day-old Wistar rats were decapitated. This
procedure is in accordance with the regulation of the Polish Animal
Welfare Act. Hippocampi were removed, manually sliced, treated with
trypsin, mechanically dissociated, centrifuged twice at 40 g, plated in
Petri dishes, and cultured. Experiments were performed on cells between
10 and 17 days in culture.
Electrophysiological Recordings. Currents were recorded in the
whole-cell conﬁguration of the patch-clamp technique using the Axopatch
200B ampliﬁer (Molecular Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) at a holding
potential (Vh)o f-40 mV. The intrapipet solution contained (in mM) CsCl
137, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 2, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′-tetraacetic
acid (BAPTA) 11, ATP 2, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The
composition of the standard external solution was (in mM) NaCl 137, KCl
5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 20, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 with NaOH).
For the whole-cell recordings, patch pipets had a resistance of 2.5-4.0
MΩ when ﬁlled with internal solution. The whole-cell recordings were
included in the statistics when the access resistance was below 10 MΩ.
The cells in which series resistance showed a clear tendency to increase
during recordings were not considered in the analysis. Recordings in the
whole-cell mode were started at least 3 min after establishing the whole-
cell mode. This time was sufﬁcient to stabilize the recording conditions.
The agonist was applied using the RSC-200 multibarrel rapid perfusion
system (Bio-Logic, Grenoble, France). With this system, in the whole-
cell conﬁguration, the solution exchange occurred within 30-100 ms.
Before each control recording, cells were washed with normal external
solution for at least 3 min. In studies aiming at assessment of the impact
of considered test compounds [oneantotoxin (1a), dihydrooneantotoxin
(1b)] on GABA-elicited responses, these compounds were present both
in the washing solution (for at least 3 min before agonist application) and
in the agonist-containing saline. For acquisition and data analysis, pClamp
9.2 software was used (Molecular Devices Corporation). To avoid the data
scatter due to cell-to-cell variability, the effect of studied drugs was assessed
by calculating the relative amplitude values with respect to the controls
recorded from the same cell. For the analysis of currents, recorded in the
whole-cell conﬁguration, the current signals were low-pass ﬁltered at 3
kHz with a Butterworth ﬁlter and sampled at 10 kHz using the analog-
to-digital converter Digidata 1322A (Molecular Device Corporation) and
stored on a computer hard disk. Data are expressed as mean ( SEM. A
paired Student t test was used to assess the signiﬁcance of differences
between considered data sets. All experiments were performed at room
temperature, 22-24 °C.
