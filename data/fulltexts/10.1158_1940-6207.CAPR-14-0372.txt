Research ArticleSarsaparilla (Smilax Glabra Rhizome) ExtractInhibits Cancer Cell Growth by S Phase Arrest,Apoptosis, and Autophagy via Redox-DependentERK1/2 PathwayTiantian She1, Like Qu1, Lixin Wang1, Xingxin Yang2, Shuo Xu3, Junnan Feng1,Yujing Gao4,Chuanke Zhao1, Yong Han1, Shaoqing Cai2, and Chengchao Shou1AbstractCancer is still the major cause of death across the world.Regular approaches cannot effectively solve the emerging pro-blems, including drug/radiation resistance, side effects, andtherapeutic ineffectiveness. Natural dietary supplements haveshown effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of cancer.Sarsaparilla (Smilax Glabra Rhizome) has growth-inhibitoryeffects on several cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, with littletoxicity on normal cells. However, the mechanism underlyingits function remains elusive. In the present study, we examinedthe anticancer activity of the supernatant of the water-solubleextract (SW) from sarsaparilla. Liquid chromatography/massspectrometry–ion trap–time-of-ﬂight (LC/MS-IT-TOF) analysisidentiﬁed ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids as themajor bioactive components of SW. SW was shown to markedlyinhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines in thein vitro and in vivo assays. S phase arrest, autophagy, or/andapoptosis were partly responsible for SW-induced growth inhi-bition. Results of microarray analysis and validation by quan-titative RT-PCR indicated the involvement of oxidative stressand the MAPK1 pathway in SW-treated cells. We further foundthat SW destroyed intracellular-reduced glutathione/oxidizedglutathione (GSH/GSSG) balance, and supplement withN-acetylcysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH) signiﬁcantlyantagonized SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis, and autop-hagy. In addition, SW-induced GSH/GSSG imbalance activatedthe ERK1/2 pathway, which contributed to SW-induced S phasearrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and resultant growth-inhibitoryeffect. Together, our results provide a molecular basis forsarsaparilla as an anticancer agent. Cancer Prev Res; 8(5); 464–74.2015 AACR.IntroductionCancer, with ever-growing incidence and mortality, threatenshumanhealth andquality of lifeworldwide. By 2030, therewouldbe an estimated increment of 20.3 million new cases, with 13.2million cancer-related deaths (1); therefore, both preventive andtherapeutic approaches are critical for the ﬁght against cancer.Natural dietary supplements, belonging to Nutritional Therapeu-tics of Complementary and Alternative Medicine ﬁeld, provide apractical choice for cancer prevention and treatment (2–6).Sarsaparilla, also known as Smilax Glabra Rhizome (SGR) orSmilax Glabra Roxb (7, 8), regularly serves as a supplement ofherbal formula in treating diseases such as syphilis, gout, gon-orrhea, inﬂammation, liver problems, and cancer in SoutheastAsia and North America (9–11). Several reports revealed the rolesof sarsaparilla in modulating immunity (12), protecting liverfrom injuries (13), lowering blood glucose level (14), and inhi-biting cancer development (15); however, there is no epidemio-logic evidence regarding sarsaparilla's functions.Sarsaparilla extract showed killing effect on WiDr (humancolon cancer cell), HeLa, and human leukemia cells, with littlecytotoxicity to human umbilical vein enduothelial cells (10, 16).Herbal formula containing sarsaparilla restrained xenograftgrowth in mice and ameliorated the condition of patients withmiddle or late-stage primary hepatic carcinoma (15, 17). Ourprevious study demonstrated the anticancer effect of total ethanolextract of sarsaparilla in vitro and in vivo, which correlated withactivation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (7). S or S–G2phase arrest was also attributed to sarsaparilla's function (18).However, the exact mechanism underlying sarsaparilla's inhibi-tory effects on cancer cell growth remains obscure.To evaluate the biologic effect of sarsaparilla, several means ofextraction had been developed (7, 10, 16, 18). In the presentstudy, we optimized extraction procedures and sequentially sep-arated the total ethanol extract of sarsaparilla into six fractions.Results of in vitro screening assay revealed that the supernatantof water-soluble fraction (SW) possessed strongest anticancerpotential, and mass spectrometry analysis identiﬁed major1Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Min-istry of Education), Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biol-ogy, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing, China.2State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School ofPharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China. 3Depart-ment of Pharmaceutical Science, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China. 4Keylaboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry ofEducation, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ning-xia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.Note: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer PreventionResearch Online (http://cancerprevres.aacrjournals.org/).Corresponding Authors: Chengchao Shou, Peking University Cancer Hospitaland Institute, 52 Fucheng Road, Beijing 100142, China.

The anticancer effect of SW fractionwas further validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Wedemonstrated SW-induced cancer cell growth inhibition is partlyassociated with S phase arrest, apoptosis and autophagy throughactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway in a GSH/GSSG imbalance-dependent manner.Materials and MethodsMaterials and reagents3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT),crystal violet, DMSO, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), L-glutathionereduced (GSH), catalase, 3-methyladenine (3MA), BSA, RNaseA, propidium iodide (PI), 40,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole(DAPI), PD98059, and nocodazole were purchased from Sig-ma-Aldrich. 50-Bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and proteaseinhibitor cocktail were from Roche.

The procedure for preparation of total ethanol extract(ST) was described previously (7). A 20,000 g powdered sarsa-parilla was extracted by ethanol to get 2,552 g ST (yield percent-age: 12.76%). ST was resuspended in deionized water and thenextracted successively by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol (H2O-saturated) to obtain petroleum ether-soluble (SP),ethyl acetate-soluble (SE), and n-butanol-soluble (SB) fractions(19). The remaining water-soluble (SWT) fraction were furtherseparated into the supernatant (SW) and precipitant (SWP) frac-tions by ethanol extraction. The yield percentage of SW was7.27%. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry–ion trap–time-of-ﬂight (LC/MS-IT-TOF) system (Shimadzu, Japan) wasused for analysis of the chemical constituents of SW. The acquireddata were processed by Shimadzu LC/MS solution Version 3.36,Formula Predictor Version 1.01, and Accurate Mass Calculatorsoftware. All fractions were solvent free through solvent removaland lyophilization. The solvent for preparation of all fractions(stock) was 3% DMSO in PBS and concentration of DMSO inworking solutions was less than 0.15%. All the SW used in ourexperiments was from the same batch of preparation.Cell lines and cell cultureBGC-823, MGC-803, HeLa, and GES-1 cells were kindly pro-vided by Dr. Dajun Deng (Peking University Cancer Hospital &Institute, Beijing, China). BICR cells were gifted by Dr. ZhiqianZhang (Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing,China).

Mice H22 hepatocarcinoma cells werepurchased fromBeijingCowinBiotech. AGS,HT-29,HepG2, PC3,T24, EJ, H1299, and PG cells were obtained from the ATCC. Allcells were cultured under recommended conditions. Culturemedia and FBS were from Invitrogen. All cell lines were authen-ticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling. Mycoplasma test wasperformed biweekly by qPCR ampliﬁcation of M. hyorhinis p37,Hochest 33258 staining, and PCR ampliﬁcation of the rRNA genesequences of Mycoplasma with a kit from HD Biosciences.Cell growth assaySW's effect on cancer cell growthwas assessed byMTT assay andcolony formation assay as previously described (7). Alternatively,cell conﬂuence rates were measured by a CloneSelect Imagersystem (Molecular Devices) every 24 hours.Tumor xenograft and allograft assaysAnimal experiments were approved by the Biomedical EthicalCommittee of PekingUniversityCancerHospital and Institute andperformed along institutional animal welfare guidelines concor-dant with the U.S. guidelines (NIH Publication #85-23, revised in1985). Female BALB/c nude mice and BALB/c mice aged 7 to 8weeks (Vital River Laboratories) were housed under speciﬁc path-ogen-free conditions. A total of 2105 HT-29 cells, 1 106MDA-MB-231 cells, or 2.5 106 H22 cells were injected s.c. in the rightﬂank of each mouse. When tumor sizes reached 100 mm3, micewere grouped randomly with 7 or 4 mice each and given by oralgavage with 72.7 mg SW (prepared in PBS; equaling to 1 g crudesarsaparilla) once a day. The tumor width (W) and length (L) wasmeasured every 3 days. Two (for H22) or 3 (for HT-29 and MDA-MB-231) weeks later, all mice were sacriﬁced and solid tumorswere harvested, weighed, and pictured; tumor volume¼ (W2L)/2.Western blot and densitometric analysesCells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH7.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS, 2mmol/LDithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail.The rest procedures were described previously (7). For quantiﬁ-cation, the exposedﬁlmswere scannedat the resolutionof 600dpiand analyzed by Image Pro Plus software. The optical density ofeach image was calibrated using "measure-calibration-intensity"command, and then the protein bands were selected out using"AOI" tool. The integrated optical density (IOD) value of eachband was read out by the "Count/Size" tool.Cell-cycle distribution assayCells were harvested by trypsinization following exposure toSW, and ﬁxed in 75% ethanol at 20C overnight. After beingtreatedwithRNaseA for 30minutes, cellswere stainedwithPI andthen analyzed by a FACSCalibur system (BectonDickenson)withModFit LT 3.0 (Verity Software House Inc.).Cell synchronizationSubconﬂuent cells were synchronized at G2–M phase by treat-ment with nocodazole (AGS: 30 ng/mL for 16 hours; HT-29: 200ng/mL for 28 hours) in complete culture medium. At the end oftreatment, conditioned medium were removed and replaced byfresh medium, cells were allowed to attach for 8 hours beforeexposure to SW.BrdUrd–PI dual stainingFollowing exposure to SW for 24hours, synchronized cellswerepulse labeled with 10 mmol/L BrdUrd at 37C for 1 hour, thenAnticancer Effect of Sarsaparilla Extractwww.aacrjournals.org Cancer Prev Res; 8(5) May 2015 465Research. on May 5, 2019. © 2015 American Association for Cancercancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from Published OnlineFirst March 2, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-14-0372 collected and ﬁxed in 75% ethanol at 20C overnight. Afterdenaturing DNA with 2 N HCl and neutralizing with 0.1 mol/Lsodium borate, cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibodyand subsequently FITC-conjugated secondary antibody at roomtemperature for 20 minutes. The samples were resuspended in PIstaining solution before passing through FACS Calibur analyzer.Immunoﬂuorescence assayFollowing treatment with SW, cells seeded on glass coverslipswere ﬁxed with prechilled 4% polyformaldehyde solution for 20minutes and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBSfor 5minutes. Slides were incubated with anti-LC3 (1:200) at 4Covernight and subsequently with FITC-labeled secondary anti-body at room temperature for 45 minutes. Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI and images were captured by Leica TCS SP5laser confocal microscope.ImmunohistochemistryParafﬁn-embedded HT-29 and MDA-MB-231 tumor sectionswere ﬁrst deparafﬁnized with xylene twice for 15 minutes each,and then dehydrated with a gradient of ethanol (100%, 95%,90%, 80%, and 70%) for 5 minutes each. After microwavetreatment (500 W for 10 minutes) twice in 10 mmol/L citratebuffer (pH6.3), slides were coveredwith 3%H2O2 for 10minutesto block endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, slides were incu-bated with anti-LC3 primary antibody (1:1000 in 10% goatserum/PBS) at 4C overnight and then visualized by EnVisionDetection System (Dako).GSH/GSSG ratio assayIntracellular-reduced GSH and oxidized GSH (GSSG) weredetermined using modiﬁed Tietze recycling method (GSH andGSSG Assay Kit; Beyotime). Brieﬂy, cells treated with SW orsolvent were ﬁrstly collected through trypsinization and thenlysed in ice-cold M buffer (containing sulfosalicylic acid, whichinhibits g-glutamyl transferase activity, thus preventing loss ofGSH) by three freeze–thaw cycles. Cell lysate was kept on ice for 5minutes before centrifugation at 10,000 g at 4C for 10minutes.The supernatant was used directly for GSH determination but forGSSG determination, the supernatant required 2-vinylpyridineand triethanolamine treatment to remove existing GSH beforerunning into following same steps as GSH determination. Stan-dard curves of GSH and GSSG were made in each experiment forOD-to-concentration conversion.ROS and NO measurementIntracellular ROS and NO levels were evaluated using DCFH-DA and DAF-FM DA probes, respectively (Beyotime).Annexin V–PI dual stainingThe effect of SW on cell apoptosis was evaluated using theAnnexin V–PI Dual Staining Assay Kit (Biosea).Microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCRRNA was extracted from solvent and SW-treated AGS cells withTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Gene-expression proﬁles were exam-ined by ShangHai Biotech using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0stmicroarrays containing 36,079 transcripts and variants. Afternormalization, the fold change was calculated. A P value of<0.05 and the fold change >1.5 were considered to be statisticallysigniﬁcant. Microarray data can be tracked in NCBI Gene Expres-sion Omnibus under accession no. GSE56593. Real-time RT-PCRwas performed according to the manufacturer's instructions(SYBR, TOYOBO). The primers were listed in SupplementaryTable S1.Statistical analysisValues represented the mean SD of at least two independentexperiments. P values were calculated by the two-tailed Student ttest or one-way ANOVA using IBM SPSS 18.0. A P value of lessthan 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant; /#, P < 0.05;/##, P < 0.01; , P < 0.001.ResultsLC/MS-IT-TOF analysis of chemical constituents of SW fractionWe sequentially separated the total ethanol extract of sarsapa-rilla (ST) into petroleum ether-soluble (SP), ethyl acetate-soluble(SE), n-butanol-soluble (SB), and water-soluble (SWT) fractionsas previously described (19). The SWTs were further divided intothe supernatant (SW) and precipitant (SWP) fractions (Supple-mentary Fig. S1A). Through in vitroMTT assay with MCF-7 breastcancer and BGC-823 gastric cancer cells and IC50 measurement,we found the anticancer activity of SW was similar to that of STand was higher than those of other ﬁve fractions (SupplementaryFig. S1B and S1C). The chemical composition of SW fraction wasanalyzed by the LC/MS-IT-TOF system. Besides bioactive ﬂavo-noids and phenylpropanoids reported in sarsaparilla, such ascatechin (19), astilbin (18, 19), isoastilbin (18, 19), taxifolin(19), and smiglasides (20), we, for the ﬁrst time, found 14alkanoids in SW fraction (Fig. 1A and B).SW fraction possesses anticancer effectBecause SW and ST showed similar effects, to minimize poten-tial interferences fromSP, SB, SE, or SWP fraction, next we focusedon the effect of SW on cell growth by using 15 cell lines fromdifferent tissues. We found SW showed signiﬁcant growth inhi-bition on cancer cell lines of gastric, lung, colon, bladder, breast,liver, prostate, and cervix origins, while exhibiting little toxicity tonormal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1, suggesting a cancer-speciﬁc function of SW (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Resultsof colony formation assay conﬁrmed SW's inhibition on thegrowth of seven cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Toevaluate SW's anticancer activity in vivo, we used tumor-bearingmice models. Oral administration of SW for 21 or 14 consecutivedays signiﬁcantly decreased the growth of HT-29 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in BALB/c nudemice andH22 allografts in BALB/cmice (Fig. 1D andE; Supplementary Fig. S3A). These data revealedthe anticancer potency of SW in vitro and in vivo.SW fraction induces S phase arrest, apoptosis, and autophagyCell growth inhibition can be attributed to a block in cell-cycleprogression or/and an increase in cell death (21). SW treatmentresulted in increased S phase fraction in unsynchronized AGS andHT-29 cells, whereas no cell-cycle arrest was detected inMDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). S phase arrest was alsoobserved in synchronized AGS and HT-29 cells, with a concom-itant decline in G0–G1 populations (Fig. 2A and B). Next, wefound AGS andMDA-MB-231 cells underwent apoptosis after SWtreatment; however, no apoptosis was induced inHT-29 cells (Fig.2C; Supplementary Fig. S3C and 3D), suggesting a cell lineageShe et al.Cancer Prev Res; 8(5) May 2015 Cancer Prevention Research466Research. on May 5, 2019. © 2015 American Association for Cancercancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from Published OnlineFirst March 2, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-14-0372 Figure 1.SW fraction inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

Results of TUNEL assay furtherveriﬁed the presence of apoptosis in SW-treated MDA-MB-231xenografts (Fig. 2D). LC3II, a marker of autophagy (22), wasupregulated in SW-treated AGS and HT-29 cells, although withdifferent kinetics (Fig. 3A). Immunostaining of LC3II con-ﬁrmed the autophagosome formation in SW-treated AGS,HT-29, and MDA-MB-321 cells (Fig. 3B and SupplementaryFig. S3D), which was abolished by pretreatment of autophagy-speciﬁc inhibitor 3MA (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, autophagy wasinduced in SW-treated HT-29 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts(Fig. 3C), thus conﬁrming the proautophagic function of SWin vivo. In addition, pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, insteadof 3MA, partly antagonized SW-induced growth inhibition inAGS cells, whereas in HT-29 cells, 3MA, instead of z-VAD-FMK,showed a partially reversal effect on SW-induced growth inhi-bition (Fig. 3D and E). Therefore, contributions of apoptoticdeath and autophagic death to SW-induced growth inhibitionare cell type dependent.GSH/GSSG imbalance accounts for SW-induced S phase arrest,apoptosis, autophagy, and cell growth inhibitionPreviously, we performed gene microarray screening with RNAsamples from ST fraction-treated MCF-7 and HT-29 cells andfound that the expressions of genes involved in proliferation, cellcycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and MAPK signaling were sig-niﬁcantly affected by sarsaparilla (7). In this study, we performedgene-expression proﬁling assay with RNA samples from SW-treated AGS cells. Analysis of all differentially expressed genesrevealed a cluster of oxidative stress-related genes (Fig. 4A), whichwere validated by quantitative RT-PCR assay (Fig. 4B). Amongoxidative stress-related genes, GCLC, GCLM, GPX5, GPX2, andG6PD have been implicated in GSH metabolism (23); therefore,we evaluated the intercellular reduced glutathione/oxidized glu-tathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, one hallmark of oxidative stress (24).We found AGS and HT-29 cells suffered a marked GSH/GSSGimbalance following SW treatment for 0.5 and 24 hours (Fig. 4C).NAC, which could enrich intracellular GSH pool (25), restoredSW-induced GSH/GSSG imbalance (Fig. 4C). Moreover, GSH orNAC partially reversed SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis,autophagy, and cell growth inhibition in AGS and HT-29 cells(Fig. 4D–G), underlining the importance of GSH/GSSG imbal-ance in mediating SW's anticancer effect. Next, we examinedanother two hallmarks of oxidative stress, that is, reactiveoxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Little alterationin ROS production was detected in SW-treated cells (Supple-mentary Fig. S4A). ROS inhibitor catalase, which eliminates H2O2, exerted no reversing effect on SW-induced S phase accu-mulation or growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4B andS4C), thus excluding the possible involvement of ROS in SW-induced oxidative stress. As for NO, we observed increased NOlevels at 3 hours after SW treatment in AGS and HT-29 cells(Supplementary Fig. S4D). However, pan-inhibitor of NOsynthase L-NMMA could not abrogate SW-induced S phaseaccumulation or growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4Eand F). These results suggested that oxidative stress, resultingfrom GSH/GSSG imbalance rather than increased H2O2 or NO,was responsible for SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis,autophagy, and growth inhibition.GSH/GSSG imbalance-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylationcontributes to SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis,autophagy, and growth inhibitionResults ofmicroarray assay suggested that theMAPK1 signalingpathway was also potentially associated with SW treatment (Fig.4A), which was in agreement with our previous ﬁnding (7). Wenoticed that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was induced at 30 minutesafter SW treatment and sustained for 24 hours (Fig. 5A). Inaddition, it exhibited a redox-dependent manner, as both NACand GSH remarkably abolished SW-induced ERK1/2 phosphor-ylation (Fig. 5B). SW-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation couldbe lowered by pretreatment with MAPK kinase inhibitorU0126 (Supplementary Fig. S5A), but U0126 could not reverseFigure 2.SWfraction induces Sphase arrest andapoptosis.

Followingpretreatment with U0126 or/and PD98059, SW-induced S phasearrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and resultant growth inhibitionwere partially antagonized (Fig. 6A–D). These results support thenotion that SW triggers ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a GSH/GSSGimbalance-dependent fashion, thereby causing S phase arrest,apoptosis, autophagy, and cell growth inhibition (Fig. 6E).DiscussionBesides as a natural dietary supplement, sarsaparilla hasbeen used to treat cancer in Southeast Asia (15, 17, 26, 27).

In thisstudy, we found SW fraction had strongest anticancer activityamong the six fractions sequentially extracted from total extract(ST) of sarsaparilla. Because ST and SW had similar IC50 values, itwouldbe cost-effective andeasier touse ST for treatment of cancer.Figure 4.GSH/GSSG imbalance is associated with SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and cancer cell growth inhibition.

Interestingly, alkaloids were newly identiﬁedfrom sarsaparilla, possibly due to our modiﬁed extraction meth-od. Therefore, the anticancer effect of SWmight be determined bythe combined action of multiple compounds in the mixture.

Both prosurvival and antisurvival functions of autop-hagy have been demonstrated (22, 32, 33). The role of autophagyin oxidative stress-induced cell death depends on cell type (34,35). In our study, SW induced autophagy in AGS, HT-29, andMDA-MB-231 cells, but apoptosis was not found in HT-29 cells.Meanwhile, only z-VAD-FMK could partly reversed SW-inducedcell growth inhibition in AGS cells whereas in HT-29 cells only3MA could do. Such cell lineage speciﬁcity has been noticedpreviously. For instance, triptolide-treatedMiaPaCa-2 cells under-went apoptosis, whereas triptolide-treated S2-013 and S2-VP10cells went for autophagy-related cell death, despite they are allpancreatic cancer cells (21). In addition, c-Jun NH2-terminalkinase inhibitor SP600125 could inhibit the proliferation of bothAGS and HT-29 cells, with apoptosis only induced in AGS cells,possible due to the difference in the basal levels of JNK2 (36).Comparison of pathways targeted by SW in different cells willprovide explanation for the disparity in death response.Figure 6.ERK1/2 phosphorylation associates with SW-induced S phase arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and growth inhibition.

Here, we found no ROSwas induced by SW. The different effects on oxidative stress mightbe attributed to the integrated functions of distinct compositions.The GSH/GSSG ratio, as a crucial determinant of intercellularredox status (24), was deregulated in SW-treated AGS and HT-29cells. Supplement with NAC or GSH abrogated SW-induced Sphase arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and resultant cell growthinhibition, underscoring the crucial role of GSH in sarsaparilla'santicancer effect. Decline in antioxidants and/or boost in otheroxidative signals than H2O2 or NOmight play some roles, whichdeserves further exploration. Increased transcription of GSHsynthesis-related genes, such as GCLM, GCLC, and G6PD (23),did not restore GSH/GSSH balance, suggesting that these changeswere likely the adaptive response to SW treatment.Metabolism-targeted therapy shows great potential and advan-tage in cancer treatment (39). Chemicals targeting the enzymesessential for cancer metabolism, such as pyruvate kinaseM2 (40),pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK; ref. 41) and lactate dehy-drogenase (39), are currently tested in preclinical or clinical trials.Dichloroacetate, an orally available inhibitor of PDK, was foundto promote the apoptosis of cancer cells in multiple in vitro and invivo models (41). Normal cells, however, were unaffected bydichloroacetate, perhaps due to low level of PDK activity (41).Our results indicated that SW affected the expression of manymetabolism-related genes. It is likely that SW might target somemetabolic pathways that are necessary for the survival of cancercells, but dispensable for the normal cells, thus leading to thepreference of SW for cancer cells. However, which pathways weremajorly targeted and how they were disrupted by SW are stillunder investigation.ERK has been deemed as a therapeutical target because of itsantiapoptotic function in cancer cells (42), but context-dependentproapoptotic effect of ERKwas also documented. Redox-triggeredERK1/2 phosphorylation could induce both intrinsic and extrin-sic apoptotic pathways (43, 44), and autophagy can be positivelyregulated by ERK1/2 (21). Various drugs induced autophagieswere correlatedwith a persistent activation or cytoplasmic seques-tration of ERK1/2 (21, 45). Furthermore, Selenomethionine, ananticancer agent already used in clinical trials, could inducesustained phosphorylation of ERK and S/G2–M phase arrest inHCT116 and SW48 cells (46). In the present study, we observed asustained phophorylation of ERK in SW-treated AGS and HT-29cells. Meanwhile, U0126 or/and PD98059 antagonized SW-induced effects, highlighting ERK as a critical target of sarsaparilla.Together, we demonstrated the anticancer effect of SW overmultiple cell lines in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with Sphase arrest, autophagy, and apoptosis. Moreover, we uncovereda GSH/GSSG imbalance-dependent activation of the ERK1/2pathway in SW-treated cells, which was responsible for the anti-cancer effect of SW fraction (Fig. 6E). Our results suggest sarsa-parilla, as a potential anticancer agent, shows great promise infuture preclinical and clinical applications.Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of InterestNo potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed.Authors' ContributionsConception and design: T.
