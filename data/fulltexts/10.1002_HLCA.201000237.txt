From the aerial parts of Senecio dianthus, four new eremophilenolides (1 – 4, resp.) and one new
eremophilenolide alkaloid (5), of the relatively uncommon eremophilenoid-type sesquiterpenoid
lactones, were isolated together with three known sesquiterpenoid lactones, 10b-hydroxyeremophil-
7(11)-en-12,8a-olide (6), 8b,10b-dihydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide (7), and 10a-hydroxy-1-
oxoeremophila-7(11),8(9)-dien-12,8-olide (8). On the basis of IR, MS, and NMR data, particularly
2D-NMR analyses, the structures of the new compounds were established as: 2b-(angeloyloxy)-10b-
hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide (1), 6b-(angeloyloxy)-10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-
olide (2), 2b-(angeloyloxy)-8b,10b-dihydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide (3), 2b-(angeloyloxy)-8a-
hydroxyeremophila-7(11),9(10)-dien-12,8b-olide (4), and 8b-amino-10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-
12,8a-olide (5). In addition, the relative configuration of 1 was corroborated by X-ray diffraction
analysis.
Introduction. – As part of our continuing research on the identification of novel
bioactive natural products from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), we have
investigated the chemical constituents of Senecio dianthus Franch, which is mostly
distributed in Tibet and reputed for reducing fever and detoxification in Tibetan herbal
medicine [1]. Previous investigations on the genus Senecio indicated that pyrolizidine
alkaloids and furo-eremophilanes are the typical compounds isolated from this genus,
but nothing is known about the chemical constituents of Senecio dianthus. In this
present study, five new eremophilenolides (sesquiterpenoid lactones of eremophilane
type), a relatively uncommon group of sesquiterpenoid lactone family with only a few
dozen of members identified so far, were isolated from the EtOH extract of the aerial
parts. Here, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of these new compounds.
Results and Discussion. – 1. Structure Elucidation. TheAcOEt fraction of the EtOH
extract from the aerial parts of the plant was separated by SiO2 column chromatog-
raphy (CC), and seven eremophilenolides, 1 – 6 and 8 (Fig. 1), were isolated. The
BuOH fraction of the EtOH extract was separated by SiO2 CC, and another
eremophilenolide alkaloid, 5, was isolated. The structures of two known compounds 6
and 7 were readily assigned to 10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide and 8b,10b-
dihydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide, respectively, by comparing the physical and
NMR spectral data with those reported in the literature [2]. Both were isolated first

fromHertia cheirifolia, and their absolute configurations were determined by chemical
transformation [3] and X-ray diffraction analysis [4].
The molecular formula of 1 was established as C20H28O5 by HR-ESI-MS (m/z
371.1840 ([MþNa]þ , C20H28NaOþ5 ; calc. 371.1834). The IR showed broad absorption
bands at 3424, 1729, 1699, 1685, and 1640 cm1 suggesting the presence of functional
groups of a,b-unsaturated-g-lactone and unsaturated ester, characteristic of unsatu-
rated sesquiterpenoid lactones such as 6 and 7. The 13C-NMR (Table) spectrum of 1
showed 20 C-atom signals which were assigned by DEPT experiments to eight
quaternary C-atoms, and three CH, four CH2, and five Me groups which could be
accounted for a sesquiterpenoid lactone nucleus (15 C-atoms) with an additional
angeloyl substitutent (five C-atoms). The 13C-NMR signals (Table) of 1 due to the
sesquiterpenoid lactone portion were very similar to those of 6, except for the signals of
C(1), C(2), and C(3), presumably due to the introduction of a substituent at C(2), the
resonance of which was shifted to low-field. In the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table), besides
the typical signals attributed to the sesquiterpenoid moiety as for a tertiary Me group
(d(H) 1.07 (s)), a secondary Me group (d(H) 0.91 (d, J¼ 6.7)), and an olefinic Me
group (d(H) 1.83 (d, J¼ 1.3)), an additional group of signals (d(H) 6.05 (qq, J¼ 7.2, 1.3,
1 H); 1.97 (s, 3 H); 1.85 (d, J¼ 1.3, 3 H); 4.78 – 4.84 (m, 1 H)), which could be assigned
to an angeloyloxy (AngO) group, were also observed. This suggested that 1 was an
analog of 6 with an additional (AngO) group. This assignment was confirmed by 1H-
detected 2D-NMR spectroscopy which provides the direct through-bond connectivity
of one bond (HSQC) and multiple-bond (two or three) bonds (HMBC), together with
determination of the relative configuration based on the coupling constants and spatial
proximity information from COSYand NOESY (Fig. 2). In the HMBC, a strong 1H,13C
long-range correlation was observed of HC(2) (d(H) 4.81) to CO C-atom C(1’) (d(C)
167.3), providing exclusive evidence for the linkage of the AngO group to C(2). The
NOESY correlation between HaC(4) and HC(2) allows the assignment of the AngO
group as b-oriented. The pair of non-equivalent CH2 H-atoms (from HSQC) at C(9)
could be differentiated to HaC(9) (d(H) 1.85 – 1.86 (m)) and HbC(9) (d(H) 2.36 (dd,
J¼ 13.2, 6.7)) by NOESY correlations HC(4)/HaC(9) and HbC(9)/HbC(6). Thus,
the b-configuration of HC(8) was deduced based on the NOE effect between
HbC(9) and HC(8). The relative configuration of 1 was confirmed undoubtedly by

X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 3). Therefore, the structure of 1 was determined as 2b-
(angeloyloxy)-10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide.
The molecular formula of 2 was established as C20H28O5 by HR-ESI-MS (m/z
371.1834 ([MþNa]þ , C20H28NaOþ5 ; calc. 371.1834). Similar to that of 1, the IR
spectrum of 2 exhibited typical absorptions of an a,b-unsaturated-g-lactone
(1739 cm1), an a,b-unsaturated ester (1650 cm1), and a C¼C bond (1640 cm1). In
addition, 2 gave 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral profiles (Table) very similar to those of 1,
suggesting 2 as an AngO-substituted eremophilenolide with a structure close to that of
1. A closer inspection of the 2D-NMR spectra revealed that the AngO group should be
at C(6) in 2 rather than at C(2) in 1. This is confirmed by the HMBC correlations of
HC(6) to C(1’), C(5), and C(7), as well as of HC(14) to C(6). The b-orientation of
AngO was evident fromNOESY correlation between HC(6) and HC(4). Moreover,
the HMBC correlation of HOC(10) (d(H) 3.03) to C(1) and C(10), and of HC(1) to
HC(9), provided further evidence for the skeleton connectivity. In NOESY spectrum,
correlations were observed between HOC(10) and HC(8), supporting the a-
configuration of the g-lactone. Thus, the structure of 2 was determined as 6b-
(angeloyloxy)-10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide.
The molecular formula of 3 was established as C20H28O6 by HR-ESI-MS (m/z
387.1789 ([MþNa]þ , C20H28NaOþ6 ; calc. 387.1784). The 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table)
were very similar to those of 1. The most noticeable difference between them was due
to the presence of a quaternary C-atom signal at d(C) 102.4 in 3 instead of a signal of a
CH group at d(C) 78.0 in 1, indicating a tertiary OH group at C(8) in 3. The orientation
of HOC(8) was determined as b on the basis of 1H-NMR data. It was reported that

the relative order of 1H chemical shifts of Me(15) and Me(14) is diagnostic for the
configuration at C(8) [5], i.e., Me(15) resonates at lower field than Me(14) in the 8a-
MeO derivatives, while the order reversed in their 8b-counterparts. Thus, HO at C(8)
should be b-oriented, as Me(15) resonated at higher field thanMe(14). However, more
direct evidence for the b-orientation of HO at C(8) was obtained from a NOESY
experiment whereby an indicative NOE correlation was observed between Me(15) and
HC(6), which would not have been observed if HO at C(8) would be a-oriented, on
the basis of a Dreiding model of this skeleton [6]. Therefore, the structure of 3 was
determined as 2b-(angeloyloxy)-8b,10b-dihydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide.
Compound 4 was shown to have the molecular formula C20H26O5 as deduced from
HR-ESI-MS (m/z 369.1684 ([MþNa]þ , C20H26NaOþ5 ; calc. 369.1678)), indicating eight
degrees of unsaturation. It showed a 13C-NMR spectrum similar to that of 3. However,
a close inspection revealed considerable differences. Two C-atom signals corresponding
to additional C¼C bond were observed at d(C) 121.2 and 148.0 in 4, while the O-
bearing quaternary C-atom signal at d(C) 74.1 in 3 disappeared. This indicated the
presence of a C(9)¼C(10) bond. Further confirmation was provided by the HMBC
correlation of Me(14) to C(10) (d(C) 148.0). According to the empirical 8-
configuration diagnostic principle [5] based on the order of the chemical shifts of
Me(15) (d(H) 1.02 (d, J¼ 6.8)) and Me(14) (d(H) 0.94 (s)), and in contrast to 3, the
orientation of OH at C(8) of 4 was elucidated as a, as Me(15) resonated at lower field
than Me(14). Thus, the structure of 4 was established as 2b-(angeloyloxy)-8a-
hydroxyeremophil-7(11),9(10)-dien-12,8b-olide.
Compound 5 was shown to have a molecular formula C15H23NO3 as established by
HR-ESI-MS (positive-ion mode; m/z 288.1573 ([MþNa]þ , C15H23NNaOþ3 ; calc.
288.1576). The NMR data (Table) were very similar to those of 8b,10b-dihydroxyer-
emophilenolide (7) except for an additional NH2 group at C(8). In the 1H,1H-COSY
spectrum, a long-range spin coupling (J¼ 1.5) between the olefinic Me (Me(13)) and
HbC(6) was observed. This can only be accounted for with a b-orientation of NH2 at
C(8) which is in line with a dihedral angle of ca. 308 in a Dreiding model [6]. This
feature was shared by all the compounds of this family as observed in 1, 2, and 3, but not
in 4, which exhibits an a-orientation for HO at C(8). Therefore, the structure of 5 was
determined as 8b-amino-10b-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8a-olide. This is the first
report of an amino group attached to an eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoid.
