Commonly studied biotic factors include insects and other herbivores that cause woundingand tissue damage due to microorganisms. Among abiotic factors, mechanical stress induced in the rootshas yet to be studied in depth. Such studies are of interest because of the influence of this factor on plantsgrown under in vitro conditions. Herein, we present our results on essential oil production and otherdefence-related morphological traits in terms of the effect of mechanical stress induced in the roots ofMentha pulegium plants grown under different conditions: greenhouse using soil as support and non-soil invitro conditions using gelose and glass beads. A positive correlation has been found between secondarymetabolites production, i.e. essential oil and growth conditions. The presence and development ofmorphological characteristics linked to their storage and lixiviation into the environment – trichomes andglandular hairs in the leaves; lateral roots and fibrous roots – has also been positively related to an increasein penetration resistance on the roots by the substrate – mechanical impedance. Pulegone is the majordefence compound in pennyroyal essential oil. Pulegone production and other essential oil constituentspresent in trichomes have been quantified under different growth conditions and the results have beencorrelated with morphological characteristics and growth conditions. 2014 Phytochemical Society of Europe.

IntroductionThroughout the course of their growth and development, plantsare exposed to a variety of environmental stress factors – bothbiotic and abiotic – that have an enormous influence on plantprimary and secondary metabolic production. Abiotic stress factorssuch as cold (Maruyama et al., 2009), drought (Andre et al., 2009),UV radiation (Conconi et al., 1996), heavy metals (Tumova et al.,2007) and high salinity (Nasir Khan et al., 2010) have a stronginfluence on gene expression and have been previously studied inmany crops. However, mechanical stresses other than wounding ortissue damage due to atmospheric or pathogen attack have notbeen studied extensively (Bengoung et al., 2011). Mechanicalimpedance – defined as penetration resistance on the roots by thesoil or the substrate – is present at the roots from the very* Corresponding author.

All rigbeginning of plant growth, and the cellular responses of rootsfundamentally influence the development of secondary morpho-logical characteristics such as morphogenesis, root hair develop-ment, root length and diameter (Braam, 2005; Okamoto et al.,2008). Moreover, mechanical impedance is a factor to beconsidered when it comes to grown plants under hydroponicsor non-soil in vitro culture conditions.To our knowledge, the possible connection between mechanicalimpedance and the development of other secondary defenceorgans, i.e. glandular trichomes and leaf hairs, has not beendocumented to date. The morphology and phenotypic expressionof roots during mechanical impedance has been shown to bestrikingly similar to that observed in ethylene-treated seedlings ina number of species (Kays et al., 1975; Goeschl et al., 1996) thussuggesting that signal transduction to the rest of the plant due tohormonal production and release may be involved in thedevelopment of secondary organs in parts of the plant other thanthe roots. Some of these organs are of importance in plant defence(Duffey, 1986) and secondary metabolite production (Eisner et al.,hts reserved.Table 1Caulogenese response of in vitro micro-propagated shoots of Mentha pulegium L.after 30 days of subculture under two different sets of conditions in terms ofmechanical impedance: solid (agar) and glass bead support.aAgar medium Glass beadBiomass (g) 9.20  0.006a 10.86  0.006bGrowth index (GI) 21.43  0.005a 25.49  0.005bNo. of shoots 16.10  0.01a 20.05  0.01bShoot lengths 12.000  0.007a 14.25  0.09bNo of roots 15.12  0.006a 17.31  0.006bNo. of lateral roots 4.32  0.006a 17.15  0.06bValues correspond to the mean of 10 measurements  standard error.

Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–2442341990; Wagner, 1991). Therefore, the large scale production of high-economic-value compounds through callus and in vitro culturerequires an in depth understanding of the influence that suchfactors have on metabolite production.Lamiaceae families are known to produce a wide array ofsecondary metabolites and are a rich source of economicallyvaluable terpenes. Among them, Mentha pulegium L. (pennyroyal)is characterized by a high content of essential oils (4% of the dryweight), the main component of which is the bioactive monoter-pene ketone pulegone (Thomassen et al., 1990; Aghel et al., 2004;Sampson et al., 2005; Diaz-Maroto et al., 2007). Pulegone has beenrelated with defence roles against herbivory in wild thyme(Müller-Schwarze and Thoss, 2008) and has shown insecticidal(Liu et al., 2011; Sampson et al., 2005) antibacterial (e.g., Teixeiraet al., 2013) activities, among others. Also, an increase in pulegoneproduction in Minthostachys mollis has been observed as aconsequence of leaf damage – leaf puncturing – simulating theeffect of leaf miners (Banchio et al., 2007).Pennyroyal is a well-known plant that is widely used in folkmedicine in many cultures for aromatherapy, abortifacient and as aremedy for colic. The oil is also commercially used as a flavouringagent in beverages and foods. However, the essential oil has beenassociated also with hepatotoxicity. Cytochrome P 450-mediatedoxidation of pulegone generates menthofuran (McClanahan et al.,1989) which can be further metabolized into reactive compoundsthat can form adducts to hepatocellular proteins (Khojasteh et al.,2012). Therefore, the interest of studying the factors affectingpulegone and essential oil production in pennyroyal and why thisspecies was selected as a model system to study the physiologicalchanges and variation in secondary metabolite production inducedby abiotic environmental factors.In addition to phenotype selection, an understanding of theinteractions between secondary metabolic pathways and theenvironment is a prerequisite for the optimization of secondarymetabolite production (Sharma et al., 2002). Metabolic engineeringhas been suggested as a promising technology for the production ofphytochemicals (Croteau et al., 2000), and knowledge of the factorsthat influence the distribution and accumulation of secondarymetabolites in plant tissue and organs is imperative. In this sense,high frequency tissue culture systems and efficient culturingsystems aimed at expressing the target phytochemical(s) areattractive options for the mass production of high-value secondarymetabolites (Canter et al., 2005). Tissue culture using micropropa-gation has been suggested as a promising technology for physiolog-ical and phytochemical studies (Murch et al., 2000); this method canalso play an important role in clonal propagation of high qualityplants (Sahoo and Chand, 1998; Rathore et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006,2008) and in the mass production of secondary metabolites (Prakashet al., 2002; Yoshimatsu, 2008). The use of explants cultures alsoensures higher genetic stability in comparison with callus cultures,thus allowing a better standardization of secondary metabolicproduction.The present study with M. pulegium L. offers some clues tounderstanding the physiological and phytochemical state of plantsaffected by culture conditions and environmental factors such asmechanical impedance (expressed through changes in the supportmatrix) and water levels. Knowledge about the responses of plantmorphogenesis and secondary metabolic production to theculturing parameters is needed to provide potential targets formetabolic engineering. In this study we specifically investigatedthe effects of two culture conditions (oil and non-soil) using threedifferent supports (agar, glass beads and soil) on: (1) biomassproduction and relative growth rate of shoots and roots; (2)chemical status: essential oil (pulegone) production and essentialoil profiling; and (3) histochemical status of storage glands(trichomes and leaf hair density) and root hairs.The aims of the experiments presented here were as follows: (a)to establish a correlation between the chemical (essential oilprofile and production), the histological and physiological status,and (b) to determine whether growth conditions would influencethe production of the allelochemical pulegone and other essentialoil components.2. Results and discussionMicro-shoots retain morphogenetic potential over the genera-tions and can be further multiplied or rooted. Alternatively, theirpotential for aseptic biomass production and mass production ofsecondary metabolites can also be explored and, eventually,exploited, and this is one of the main purposes of this study.Accordingly, the effects of growth conditions (with a specialattention paid to mechanical impedance) on morphogenesis,chemical profile and secondary metabolite production will bediscussed. In the present study, the in vitro shoot segments wereused as a source of explants for the production of multiple shootsthrough the de novo shoot regeneration because cutting simulatesthe effect of wounding and is known to promote re-differentiationin explants under in vitro conditions (Vinocur et al., 2000).2.1. Morphogenesis in vitro (non-soil conditions)Plant growth and developmental responses of micro-propagat-ed shoots to different culture and environmental conditions(solidified agar, glass bead support, and acclimatized plants grownin pots) characterized by different degrees of mechanical imped-ance are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Agar medium was selected asreference or control for the minimum level of mechanicalimpedance. The results in Table 1 clearly show enhanced growththrough an increase in biomass production and growth index (GI)in plants grown on glass beads in comparison with those grown inagar conditions. This increment is also correlated with a highernumber of lateral roots (Fig. 1) and continuous production oflateral roots and shoots on plants grown under the two conditions(agar and glass beads) was observed. Improved nutrient andoxygen uptake enhanced biomass growth because tissue wassupported on a floating raft that kept the tissue in constant contactwith the medium. However, the most marked differences wereobserved in the number of lateral roots: plants grown on glassbeads showed a fourfold increase with respect to those grown inagar, a finding that can be explained as being a direct result of thehigher mechanical impedance caused by the glass beads (Fig. 1).These data are indicative of the importance of mechanicalimpedance in the development of secondary morphologicalcharacteristics such as lateral roots. Whether this effect could betransferred to parts of the plant other than the roots is an issue thathas not been proven yet.Table 2Physiological and biochemical status of in vitro and in vivo plantlets.Solid agar (in vitro) Glass beads (in vitro) Plantlets in pots (in vivo)RGR (g day1 plant1) 0.06  0.001a 0.08  0.004a 0.02  0.002bGndb 0.30  0.01a 0.36  0.002b 0.14  0.01cLeaf area (cm2) 3.17  0.01a 3.24  0.012b 2.81  0.01cLWC (%) 81.45  0.02a 85.19  0.04b 60.80  0.05cTotal chlorophyll (mg/mg fresh leaf) 3.23  0.005a 3.96  0.004b 2.26  0.006cChlorophyll a 2.02  0.006a 2.45  0.004b 1.35  0.004cChlorophyll b 1.21  0.006a 1.51  0.002b 0.91  0.004cGlandular trichome (number mm2) 23.2  1.72a 24.5  2.05a 56.3  1.82bLeaf hairs (number mm2) 8.3  1.64a 21.9  2.21b 125.4  3.28cVolatiles (mg g1 fresh tissue)y 0.026 0.028 0.241RGR (relative growth rate); Gnd (nodal growth) and leaf area are means of 10 measurements  standard error; LWC (leaf water content), values of LWC and chlorophyll contentare means of 50 leaves  standard error.

Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244 235Significant differences in relative leaf water content (LWC) werealso observed between plants grown under in vitro and soilconditions, but not between the two in vitro culture conditions(Table 2). Plants growing under soil conditions present a lowerLWC. There is also a small but statistically significant difference inthe LWC between plants grown in agar and glass beads. A similarpattern can be observed in the chlorophyll content (Table 2, entries4–6). Reduction in chlorophyll contents have been correlatedpreviously with water stress (Pirzad et al., 2011). However,whether this difference in LWC for in vitro and soil conditions canbe partly attributed to a certain degree of water stress is unclear.The higher number of lateral roots observed in the glass beadsculture can also be correlated with the increase in the GI becausethe cut surfaces are better exposed to the medium. The liquidculture – while beneficial for bioreactor scale-up and plant growth– often induces hyper hydration (Aitken-Christie et al., 1995). Thisphenomenon is often attributed to the presence of a liquid layer onplants grown in the liquid medium, which in turn results in poorgas exchange (Etienne and Berthouly, 2002). Our results show thatmicro-propagated plants produced more fresh and dry weight inliquid/glass beads than in a solid medium. This finding suggeststhat an increased uptake of water and nutrients occurs in thepresence of liquid media (glass beads) when the plants have anormal morphology. This liquid/glass matrix was also recom-mended in other in vitro studies on the basis of whole plantphysiology (Kenneth and Jerzy, 1990) and has also beensuccessfully used as a support matrix for mass production andcost efficient propagation (Goel et al., 2007).2.2. Physiological and histochemical studyIn all cases, plants grown under in vitro conditions grew morevigorously and exhibited better growth bio-kinetics than thoseplants raised in pots in a greenhouse (Table 2), as shown by theFig. 1. Comparative morphogenesis of tissue cultures in plants of M. pulegium L. raised in(C): plants grown in agar; (B) and (D): plants grown in glass beads. Note the increase in t(right, glass beads).values for Relative Growth Rate (RGR), nodal growth (Gnd) and leafarea. In accordance with the caulogenese – induction of shootdevelopment from callus – response mentioned above, plantsgrown on glass beads showed a slight – but significant – increase intheir growth parameters.Glandular trichomes are reservoirs of essential oils and havebeen related with defensive roles as chemical weapons arsenals(Gang et al., 2002). The number of glandular (peltate) trichomes isnot affected by the mechanical impedance exerted on roots in thechange from the agar to glass bead support (Table 2, entries 8 and9), but this number is markedly higher in plants grown in potsunder greenhouse conditions. In all cases the number of glandulartrichomes presented a random distribution on both abaxial andadaxial sides of the leaves. Similar behaviour is also observed forthe total amount of volatiles obtained by ultrasound treatment(Fig. 2). The number of leaf hairs seems to be even more sensitive toculture conditions: significant differences were observed betweenagar and glass bead conditions and also between these plants andthose grown in pots and raised in the greenhouse. Furthermore, thedegree of development of leaf hairs appears to be higher in plantsgrown in the greenhouse than those grown under in vitroconditions (Fig. 3).It is well known that stress conditions cause an increase in theproduction of defence secondary metabolites. The dilemma ofdefence vs. growth is that the synthesis of these compoundsinvolves a flow of resources (carbon, enzymes and energy-richmolecules such as ATP or NADPH) from primary to secondarymetabolism and this is directly related with defence or growth/development costs (Herms and Mattson, 1992). It was previouslymentioned that a lower LWC was observed in greenhouse plants,but we do not have data supporting a correlation between theselevels and a certain water stress besides the fact that chlorophyllcontents were also lower. However, the mechanical impedanceexerted by the soil on the roots is by far higher than that in plants two different static media: agar and glass beads after 30 days of subculture.

Note theparallel increase of leaf glandular organs (trichomes and hairs) and volatiles inplants grown in soil in the greenhouse (in vivo). Values with different letters in eachseries (trichomes or hairs) are statistically different at 0.95 (Student’s t test).K.H. Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244236grown on glass beads. And so it happens with light intensity in thegreenhouse as compared to in vitro conditions. These factscorrelate well with the tenfold increase observed in the amountof defence volatiles produced in the trichomes of greenhouseplants in comparison with plants grown in vitro. Moreover, thenumber of leaf hairs increased with mechanical impedance, as didthe number of glandular trichomes containing essential oils.Finally, the external appearance of peltate trichomes is alsodifferent depending on the growth conditions, as shown in the SEMmicrographs: glandular trichomes of plants grown in agarsolidified and over glass beads have an ‘‘empty’’ appearance(Figs. 3 and 4), similar to that of trichomes of greenhouse plantsafter selective essential oil extraction; meanwhile, trichomes ofgreenhouse plants have a ‘‘full’’ external appearance that is turgidand swollen (Fig. 4). This observation correlates well with thedifferent essential oil contents shown in Table 2, where a steadydecrease in the amount of volatiles produced can be seendepending on the growth conditions (greenhouse, hydroponicsin glass beads and agar). The analysis by families of compoundsshows also a similar pattern for monoterpene and methyl esters offatty acid contents. This behaviour is not as clear in the volatilesesquiterpene fraction.The question arises as to whether there is any connectionbetween root response to mechanical impedance and thedevelopment of certain morphologic characteristics in other partsof the plant. The mechanical impedance is generally assumed to beperceived in the cells of the root tips through a change in themembrane voltage and this is transmitted via calcium channelsFig. 3. Histological localization micrographs (200 magnification) of secretory structurArrows are pointing at trichomes and dashed arrows pointing at leaf hairs. Note in A annumber of leaf hairs in comparison to C.(Fasano et al., 2002). This process can induce expression of somegenes in shoots (Sistrunk et al., 1994; Xu et al., 1995), thusconnecting this stimulus with responses in other parts of the plant.Despite the fact that there is still debate as to whether ethylenesynthesis or ethylene response is the main factor that regulatesroot growth and morphology during mechanical impedance, thelatest data suggest that an altered ethylene response regulates thegrowth and morphology of roots during mechanical impedance(Okamoto et al., 2008) and this implies a hormonal response to thisstress factor. As a consequence, the development of secondarycharacteristics in parts of the plants other than those directly incontact with the source of the mechanical impedance is aconvenient working hypothesis. The way in which signaltransduction takes place is still far from understood, but theavailable data point to a hormonal response since the expression oftouch-inducible (TCH) genes can be induced by a variety ofhormones (Sistrunk et al., 1994).2.3. Production of volatile compoundsDefence volatiles are stored mainly in glandular trichomes andnot in other organs. All trichomes develop very early in the life ofthe leaf. Trichomes are formed from a protodermal cell, prior todivision, and this process requires reorganization and nuclearmigration to the upper (apical) end of the cell. This is followed bythe production of large vacuoles at the bottom of the cell. The celldivides asymmetrically and this leads to the formation thetrichome (Karousou et al., 1992; Ascensão et al., 1995). Theexpression of certain secondary metabolites is most likelyassociated with organ differentiation and not biomass accumula-tion (Herms, 1999). Consequently, the stage of development ofthese organs – and those environmental factors that affect it – willgreatly influence the volatile content. According to this hypothesis,the higher number of developed defence organs (i.e. glandulartrichomes and leaf hairs) and the increase in the production ofdefence volatiles – as shown by the total production and theappearance and developmental state of the glandular trichomesand leaf hairs obtained from the SEM study – could be correlatedwith the change from in vitro (agar or glass beads) to greenhouseconditions. The effect of increased mechanical stress induced in theroots first appears on the production of lateral roots from agar toglass beads. However, the full expression of secondary organs takesplace in the change to plants grown in pots under greenhouseconditions. There are many environmental factors that aredrastically modified in this last transition – light intensity, possiblewater stress, and mechanical impedance. Among them theincreased mechanical impedance should not be rejected as ofinfluence as water stress was tried to keep at minimum with theplants being regularly watered in the greenhouse. However lightes from micro-propagated plants raised in (A): agar; (B): glass beads; and (C): soil.d B the low number of glandular trichomes and the low level of development andFig. 4.

Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244 237intensity also increased in the greenhouse and should beconsidered as another key factor. We propose that the effect ofmechanical impedance would add to the overall environmentaleffect and could be transmitted via hormones to the rest of theplant.In this study we only compared volatile compounds containedin the trichomes and obtained from the de novo apical leavesduring the vegetative stage and after complete development in thecase of in vitro plants. Despite the fact that there was an increase inbiomass on changing from solidified media (agar) to liquid media(glass beads) in plants grown under in vitro conditions, this was notaccompanied by any significant increase in the production ofvolatile compounds (Table 1; Fig. 2). This suggests that in theabsence of strong stress conditions, a high degree of morphogene-sis (biomass, leaf surface) during in vitro culture led to theTable 3Identification and quantification of volatiles from glandular trichomes of Mentha pulegiumcompound per gram of FW (fresh weight) leaves.MW r.t.

It appears that the increase in the mechanicalimpedance from agar to glass beads is not enough to triggermassive essential oil production. This finding is in good agreementwith the theories in which it is proposed that a balance must existbetween carbon allocation for growth and for the synthesis ofdefence compounds (Kenneth and Jerzy, 1990).The results of GC–MS analyses are shown in Tables 3 and 4.Compounds were identified by comparison of their retentiontimes with those of standards and/or with their mass spectra(NIST’98 library).

Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244 239The higher content in MEFA could be due to an easier extraction oflow polarity membrane lipids in contact with the organic solvent.As far as the quantification of pulegone is concerned, acalibration curve in the range between 10 and 0.001 ppm waspreviously obtained and the amount of pulegone was calculated foreach set of growth conditions (solidified agar, glass beads and potsin the greenhouse) with the results shown in Table 3. Pulegone wasthen used as an internal standard to estimate the concentration ofthe other compounds identified, assuming a response factor equalto 1.0 and a linear response. The total contents in monoterpenes,sesquiterpenes and fatty acids methyl esters were also calculatedon the basis of these results.There is a clear reduction in the pulegone content from soil to invitro conditions and this correlates well with the reduction in theessential oil production (Table 2). Also, while there is no significantdifference in the essential oil content (Table 2, entries 8 and 9) andbiomass production (Table 1) between plants grown in solidifiedagar or glass beads, there is a 20-fold increase in the amount ofpulegone produced that could be linked with the increase inmechanical impedance from agar to glass beads (5.59 and110.50 mg/mg FW, respectively; Table 3). Likewise, it seems thereis a direct correlation between the increased production ofmonoterpenes and the increased abiotic stress in the change fromagar to glass beads (mechanical impedance) and then togreenhouse. This also holds for the total amount of terpenes.Surprisingly, a statistical difference was not found between thesesquiterepene content of trichomes between soil and agarsolidified plants. Moreover, sesquiterpenes could not be detectedin plants grown on glass beads. We do not have a clear explanationfor this finding at present.In vitro explants were not subjected to any other difference inthe growth conditions other than the support in which they weregrown. It is likely that there must be a direct correlation betweenthe increase in pulegone biosynthesis and the mechanicalimpedance exerted in the roots. It has been shown previouslythat in the case of mint species the abiotic stressors such as UVradiation induce the production of essential oils that are rich inmonoterpenes (Voirin et al., 1990). It is feasible that other abioticenvironmental factors might have the same effect. This wasconfirmed by the almost 10-fold increase in the pulegone contentof greenhouse plants when compared to those grown under glassbead conditions (110.50 and 1357.35 mg/mg FW, respectively;Table 3) and the 20-fold increase when comparing agar and glassbeads conditions (Table 1). In general, monoterpenes show thesame increasing trend as pulegone on changing from in vitro togreenhouse conditions.2.4. Monoterpenes1,8-Cineole, menthone (dihydropulegone), p-menth-1-en-8-ol,pinocamphone, terpinen-4-ol and the sesquiterepenes germacreneB, germacrene D, viridiflorol and spathulenol were all detected inthe agar-grown plants, but not in plants produced under othergrowth conditions. Camphene, p-menth-8-en-2-ol acetate andchrysanthenone were detected in plants from the soil and glassbead conditions, but not in agar-grown plants. p-Menth-8-en-3-ol(isopulegol), p-menth8-en-3-one, terpineol, g-terpineol, isopule-gyl acetate, carveyl acetate and phytol were detected only in plantsgrown in vivo on soil (Fig. 5). Despite the fact that the total amountof terpene volatiles remains more or less constant under in vitroconditions, a clear difference was found between these plants andthose grown in the greenhouse.Recently, it has been shown that at least four enzymesresponsible for the biosynthesis of p-menthane monoterpenesare localized in the secretory cells of peltate glandular trichomes(Turner and Croteau, 2004). Also, inmunocytochemical studiesshow a strong connection with the secretory phase of glanddevelopment and demonstrate the importance of factors thatinfluence trichome development as well. Consequently, all of thefactors that affect trichome development will strongly influenceessential oil production, a situation in good agreement with theresults obtained for pulegone and for the monoterpene content.Pulegone is obtained from geranyl-PPO by cyclization andsuccessive oxidations and dehydrogenations. Pulegone can alsobe transformed into less toxic monoterpene ketones and alcoholsby reduction (Fig. 6). Many factors seem to influence theexpression of genes involved in monoterpene biosynthesis. Inparticular, (+)-pulegone reductase and (+)-menthofuran synthasetranscription can be upregulated by UV-B treatment, whereas ()-limonene hydroxylase transcription is down-regulated (Pino et al.,2006). An increase in (+)-pulegone has been observed in wildthyme and basil subjected to heavy goat grazing in comparison toplants growing in areas that are not exposed to these herbivores(Müller-Schwarze and Thoss, 2008), thus showing the connectionbetween these conditions and plant defence. Other factors thathave yet to be studied, including mechanical impedance, could alsobe involved. In this study, pulegone content increases from agar toglass bead conditions (Table 3), where the main difference is theincrease in mechanical impedance on the roots.Isopulegol and isopulegyl acetate were detected only in theplants grown under greenhouse conditions. These compounds areformed from pulegone through a pulegone reductase and,probably, a subsequent acetylation. According to these data, thegenes that encode the pulegone reductase seem to be repressedunder in vitro conditions. This is not surprising since pulegoneproduction is enhanced as the number of developed trichomesgrows in response to increased environmental stress (rootimpedance, water stress, UV light) and it could be a way of storingexcess pulegone in a less toxic form. Interestingly, menthone(dihydropulegone), which is formed from pulegone in a reactioninvolving another pulegone reductase, could not be detected undergreenhouse conditions, while it is present in plants grown in agar,albeit in very small amounts. The reasons for these differentoutcomes are as yet unknown. However, it has been shownpreviously that under reduced environmental pressure – e.g. in theabsence of mammalian grazers – pulegone is transformed into theless toxic menthane (Pino et al., 2006). The absence of abioticstressors such as mechanical impedance in agar conditions couldlead to the same effect by enhancing (+)-pulegone reductaseexpression. Menthone could not be detected in the trichomes ofplants grown in glass beads or in the greenhouse (Table 1).Isopulegone (p-menth-8-en-3-one), which is the direct biosyn-thetic precursor of pulegone, could only be detected in thegreenhouse plants and not those grown under the other two sets ofconditions. The ratio of isopulegone/pulegone in greenhouseplants is 0.0038. The pulegone concentration exhibits a 10-foldand ca. 20-fold decrease in glass beads and agar, respectively. Sucha decrease can cause isopulegone levels to decrease belowdetection limits, thus explaining why it does not appear in theother two profiles.Menthol – another p-menthane that is commonly described inessential oils obtained by hydrodistillation – could not bedetected in the trichome extract under any of the three growthconditions. This could indicate that production and/or storage ofthis compound takes place outside the trichomes – a situationsupported by the fact that menthol should have been detected atleast in the plants grown in the greenhouse, a fact that nothappened in this study. The absence of menthol, camphor,linalool, carvone, dihydrocarvone and b-ionone (Table 5) wasspecifically checked by comparison with standards and it can beconfirmed that none of the samples contained any of thesecompounds.Fig. 5.

Biosynthetic pathway for pulegone and its reduced forms.Adapted from Turner and Croteau (2004).K.H. Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244 241Cyclocitral (or camphone) is eluted at the same retention timeas isopulegone but appears only under agar conditions. Neithercyclocitral nor camphone have been reported before in pennyroyal.1,8-Cineole, another common allelopathic agent, appears only inplants grown on agar, but trichomes of plants grown under theother two sets of conditions do not contain 1,8-cineole.Thus, the introduction of different degrees of mechanicalimpedance in explants cultured in vitro could allow the selection ofgrowth conditions leading to plants with a high or a low content inpulegone and other volatile compounds.2.5. SesquiterpenesThe trend shown in the biosynthesis of volatile sesquiterpeneswas totally unexpected, as the amounts obtained for this familyunder greenhouse and agar conditions were almost equal (43.36and 31.13 mg/mg FW, respectively) but these compounds werebelow the limit of detection under glass bead conditions(Table 3). Such ‘‘erratic’’ behaviour can be explained only ifthe biosynthetic pathways to sesquiterpenes were knocked outunder glass bead conditions, resulting in the increased produc-tion of pulegone as a response to the increased stress induced bythe higher mechanical impedance on the roots. Reports of suchregulation of these pathways have not been published previous-ly, but this idea correlates well with the fact that pulegone is themain defence component of pennyroyal. At first glance, it mightbe proposed that the small increase in mechanical impedancefrom agar to glass beads redirects the carbon flow to thebiosynthesis of defence monoterpenes (pulegone) but this effectis not enough to increase total volatile production. The increasedmechanical impedance on the roots and its hormonal transduc-tion to other parts of the plant correlates well with the increasedmonoterpene content and the increase in leaf hairs (Fig. 2),although there is no such correlation with the number ofglandular trichomes. The situation equilibrated when plantswere transferred to the greenhouse and grown under normalconditions. Under greenhouse conditions, all pathways resumeand the synthesis of sesquiterpenes, in addition to the increasedproduction of defence monoterpenes, reaches the same levels asfor plants grown in agar.2.6. Esterified fatty acidsAs for the MEFA, there are also significant differences betweenthe fatty acid profiles of plants grown under all three sets ofconditions. It seems clear that there is an increase in theproduction of these compounds with the stress (mechanicaland/or other abiotic stressors) levels: the highest content in thesecompounds is observed in plants grown on soil in the green house(1.83 mg, 2634.8 mg/mg FW), while there is a three-fold decreasewhen plants were grown in vitro on glass beads (30 mg, 3.3 mg/mgFW) (Table 4). Finally, the concentration of MEFA was below thedetection limits in the trichomes extract of agar-grown plants. It isnoteworthy to mention that these fatty acids appear as naturalmethyl esters in the trichomes and they cannot be artefacts, giventhe extraction methodology and that no MeOH was usedthroughout all the sample processing. Essentially, eleven methylesters could be detected in the trichomes of greenhouse plants andof these only four were detected in those of plants grown on glassbeads. MEFA could not be detected in plants grown in agar. Onlymethyl linoleate, methyl stearate and methyl palmitate werepreviously reported in pennyroyal essential oil. Whether thisdecrease in the number and content of fatty acids could beindicative of a lower degree of development in the trichomes is anissue that has not been discussed.From the data presented here, it seems clear that there is acorrelation between the development of secondary organs andenvironmental stress, specifically between mechanical impedanceon roots, and defence organs (i.e. trichomes and leaf hairs).Whether this connection takes place through hormone signaltransduction or another mechanism is an issue for discussion.Ultrasound extraction performed for a short period of timeenabled the selective extraction of compounds stored in glandulartrichomes and not those in the inner tissues, as evidenced by theappearance of the trichomes in the SEM pictures before and aftertreatment. Consequently, the chemical content of essential oilsobtained by selective ultrasound extraction differs markedly fromthat obtained through hydrodistillation or supercritical fluidextraction, as previously reported in the literature.Differences are observed between the essential profiles ofexplants grown in agar and glass beads, and also between theseK.H. Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244242plants and those grown under greenhouse conditions. The maindifferences are found in the monoterpene profile (especially the p-menthane derivatives) and in the fatty acid content and profile.These differences have been correlated in this paper with anincrease in the environmental stressors: firstly in the mechanicalimpedance exerted on the roots and, possibly, light intensity.Secondly, the possibility of a certain degree of water stress being ofinfluence in the greenhouse plants cannot be discarded.3. Materials and methods3.1. Plant material and in vitro cultureAll experiments were conducted with plants grown under non-soil (in vitro) and soil (greenhouse) conditions. Original plantmaterial was collected from M. pulegium L. growing in naturalpopulations of North Morocco. The in vitro plants were inducedfrom nodal explants of M. pulegium L. cultivated in MS (Murashige& Skoog) medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L BAP (6-benzyla-minopurine), 30 mg/L sucrose and 7% agar (Murashige and Skoog,1962). Micro-shoots obtained from cultured nodal explants weremultiplied by sub-culturing after 3 weeks in fresh MS medium andused as explants for subsequent experiments. The methodologyused herein is similar to that utilized in analogous experiments forin vitro micro-propagation from nodal explants (Ugandhar et al.,2012; Sharifi et al., 2012; Islam et al., 2010).In experiments aimed at assessing the physical parameters thatinfluence biomass production and secondary metabolite accumu-lation, micro-shoots of 4 cm length were planted in Plant GrowthRegulator (PGR)-free fresh MS medium using two different supportconditions: agar and liquid medium in a glass bead (1 5 mm)matrix. The cultures were multiplied and maintained by sub-culturing in MS medium supplemented with 30 mg/L sucrose for atleast one year. All cultures were established by planting of explantsand micro-shoots in a conical flask containing 10 ml MS mediumand samples were incubated 16 h/8 h day/light photoperiod(40 mmol m2 s1 of light intensity), 24 8C  1 day and nighttemperature. Thereafter, plants were split in two groups. On groupof rooted in vitro plants were transferred to pots (one plant per pot)containing commercial potting mix in a green house in order toachieve acclimatization under natural daylight and temperatureconditions and grown during 40 days prior to achieve any analysis.The other was kept in vitro under the same conditions. Plants grownon soil under greenhouse conditions were watered regularly (twice aweek) to minimize the impact of water stress. The amount of waterper pot was always the same for all pots and treatments.Under non-soil conditions the morphological, histochemicaland physiological parameters of rooted in vitro plants weremeasured after 4 weeks of subculture (time needed for total rootinduction). In the case of plants grown in soil, measurements ofthe different parameters were started one month after trans-planting the plantlets to the pots. Analysis of plants grown undersoil and non-soil conditions was carried out within the sameperiod of time to assure comparativeness between the differentsets of results.3.2. Determination of root weight, growth ratio and otherphysiological parametersThe growth of shoots (biomass and growth index) wasmeasured as described by Catapan et al. (2002). The micro-shootswere separated from the medium, blotted and weighed. Thegrowth index (GI) was measured as the ratio of fresh weight ofharvested shoots (HsFw) minus the fresh weight of planted shoots(PsFw) divided by the fresh weight of planted shoots (Eq. (1))(Bauer et al., 2004).GI ¼ HsFw  PsFwPsFw(1)To determine leaf water content (LWC), fresh and lyophilizedfully expanded leaves of micro-propagated and acclimatized plantsof M. pulegium L. were weighed to determine the fresh (LFW) anddry (LDW) weights, respectively. Leaf water content (LWC) wasrecorded as the difference relative to the total FW (Cappelletti,1954) according to Eq. (2):LWC ¼ LFW  LDWLFW  100 (2)The number of lateral roots per shoot and the number of shootsper plant were recorded from 10 in vitro plants. The remainingplants were used for the analysis of allelochemicals. All experi-ments were repeated at least twice.Leaf chlorophyll (chl a and chl b) content was measured byacetone extraction and spectrophotometry (Spectronic 1001,Milton Roy Co., Rochester, NY) on young leaves based on themethod described by Arnon (Arnon, 1949). The contents of chl a,chl b and chl (a + b) were calculated from the light absorptionreadings (E), at 645 and 663 nm (Eq. (3)–(5)). The results ofchlorophyll estimates are means of three replicates and areexpressed as mg per mg of fresh weight of the tissue.chlða þ bÞ ¼ 8:02E663 þ 20:20E645 (3)chl a ¼ 12:7E663  2:69E645 (4)chl b ¼ 22:9E645  4:68E663 (5)3.3. Physiological status and growth kineticsThree parameters were used to provide clues about the bio-kinetics under non-soil and soil conditions: leaf area expansion,nodal growth (Gnd) and relative growth rate (RGR).The relative growth rate (RGR) (g day1 per plant) wasdetermined from the nodal growth (Gnd) (nodal number day1per shoot) and the leaf area expansion using 10 plants from eachtreatment (agar, glass beads and soil). Measurements were started30 days and 40 days, respectively, after transplanting to the pots(when active growth had started) and RGR was obtained fromEq.

Leaf hairs and trichomes:morphology and densityFifty leaves of uniform size from in vitro plants grown in glassbeads and agar matrix and from plants grown in pots undergreenhouse conditions were collected for electron microscopyscanning studies (SEM) (Quanta 200 scanning electron micro-scope). Leaves were dried overnight under vacuum. Coating withgold or gold/palladium alloy was not necessary in view of theresults obtained in the initial experiments. Micrographs wererecorded at 100, 200, 500 and 1000 magnification. Thedensity of leaf secretory structures (i.e. capitate and peltatetrichomes and simple hairs) was recorded on abaxial and adaxialsides of the leaf. Differences were not found between the samplesand the results quoted are means of all experiments.The density of secretory structures was estimated by countingthem over a fixed area selected randomly on the micrograph. Threeareas were counted per leaf and results are given based on theK.H. Benlarbi et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 8 (2014) 233–244 243results of ten different leaves per culture type (agar and glass beadexplants, and pots in the greenhouse). A comparative study of theleaf secretory structures was also performed before and afterextraction with dichloromethane (DCM) using ultrasound underthe same conditions.3.5. StatisticsThe data for all parameters were subjected to one way ANOVAusing the statistical package available from SPSS.3.6. Histochemical studies. Essential oil extractionFifty fresh leaves were sampled from M. pulegium L. grownunder the three different sets of growth conditions. Leaves fromeach set of culture conditions were weighed and extracted for1 min in 10 mL of DCM in separate sealed glass sample vials usingultrasound. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum in a coldbath (water with ice, 0–5 8C) in order to avoid loss of essential oils.Samples were then redissolved in 1 mL of acetone for GC–MSanalysis and kept sealed in the same vial at 30 8C prior to use.3.7. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of essential oilsGC volatile analyses were performed using a Varian CP-3800 gaschromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) andan electronic pressure injector Model 1177 (Varian CP-8400Autosampler) coupled with a Varian Saturn 2200 mass spectrometerwith electron impact ionization (70 eV). A sample volume of 1 mLwas injected in split/splitless mode during 0.1 min (split ratio of 1:9)on a DB1 column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness) usinghelium as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.6 mL/min. The analyseswere performed using the following temperature programme: oventemperature isotherm at 40 8C for 3 min, from 40 to 300 8C at a rateof 10 8C min1, and isotherm at 300 8C for 5 min. The injector anddetector were held, respectively, at 50 8C and 250 8C. Quantitativedata were obtained from the electronic integration of peak areas. Thescan time and mass range in the mass spectrometer were 1s and 40–300 m/z, respectively.Pulegone was identified by comparison of its retention time(r.t. = 12.94 min) with that of the standard sample run under thesame conditions and by matching its recorded mass with that storedin the NIST’98 library. Standards of b-pinene, linalool, camphor,isopulegol, menthol, dihydrocarvone, carvone, b-caryophyllene andall methylated fatty acids (MEFA) were also used to identifycompounds by their retention times (r.t.) and mass spectra (Tables 3and 4). The remaining compounds were tentatively identified bymatching their mass spectra with those stored in the same libraryand by comparison with the profiles published in the literature fromprevious studies on M. pulegium L. The concentrations of identifiedcompounds were estimated by reference to that of pulegone, whichwas used as the internal standard, within the same chromatogram.Each sample measurement was repeated three times.3.8. Calibration curves for pulegoneA calibration curve was run with a standard sample (Sigma–Aldrich, Co.) at concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 ppm.Each concentration was analyzed three times and average areasobtained by integration of chromatogram peaks (FID) werecorrelated with the concentration (r2 = 0.9968 on FID).AcknowledgementsK.H.B.Z. acknowledges financial support from Ministerio deEducación y Ciencia (BOE 12/1/2007 grant A/7251/06).
