Oleoresin (pitch) i s  a defensive secretion composed of monoter- 
pene olefins (turpentine) and diterpene resin acids (rosin) that i s  
produced in grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.) stems in response to 
wounding. Monoterpene and diterpene biosynthesis are coordi- 
nately induced in wounded stems as determined by monitoring the 
adivity of monoterpene and diterpene cyclases, as well as two 
cytochrome P450-dependent diterpenoid hydroxylases involved in 
the formation of (-)-abietic acid, the principal resin acid of this 
species. l h e  adivity of these enzymes reaches maximum levels that 
are 5- to 100-fold higher than those of nonwounded control stems 
10 d after wounding and this i s  followed by a synchronous decline. 
l h e  increase in biosynthetic adivity i s  consequently followed by 
the accumulation of a viscous mass of resin acids, with the loss of 
the volatile monoterpenes, at the site of injury. The observed 
coordinate induction of monoterpene olefin and abietic acid bio- 
synthesis and the results of oleoresin analysis are consistent with 
the role of the volatile monoterpenes as a solvent for the mobili- 
zation and deposition of resin acids at the wound site to seal the 
injury with a rosin barrier after the evaporation of the turpentine. 
l h e  last step of resin acid biosynthesis i s  catalyzed by an opera- 
tionally soluble aldehyde dehydrogenase that i s  not inducible by 
wounding but seemingly is expressed constitutively at a high level. 
In vivo ["Clacetate feeding and resin analysis indicate that this 
enzyme is  not efficiently coupled to the earlier steps of the 
pathway. 
Many conifer species secrete oleoresin, composed mainly 
of monoterpene olefins (turpentine) and diterpenoid resin 
acids (rosin), in response to wounding and attack by insects 
and pathogens (Johnson and Croteau, 1987; Nebeker et al., 
1993). This material represents an important defensive secre- 
tion based on the antifungal properties and toxicity toward 
bark beetles of oleoresin constituents (Raffa et al., 1985) and 
on the ability to physically seal injuries by solidification of 
the resin acids after evaporation of the turpentine (Croteau 
and Johnson, 1985). Constitutive oleoresin is synthesized in 
the epithelial cells of specialized secretory structures such as 
resin blisters or ducts, whereas induced oleoresin appears to

originate in nonspecialized cells, adjacent to the site of injury, 
that are not normally associated with terpenoid production 
(Cheniclet, 1987; Raffa, 1991; Yamada, 1992). In both in- 
stances, analytical and microscopic evidence (Lieutier and 
Benyman, 1987; Cheniclet et al., 1988) suggests that the 
monoterpenes and diterpenoids are formed at about the same 
time in the same location, consistent with the requirement 
for an organic solvent (turpentine) in which the water-insol- 
uble diterpene resin acids can be dissolved and translocated 
(Croteau and Johnson, 1985). 
Grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.) has proved to be a useful 
model for the study of induced oleoresin production (Lew- 
insohn et al., 1992a; Gijzen et al., 1993). Formation of oleo- 
resin monoterpenes in this species is catalyzed by a series of 
synthases (cyclases) that transform the common Clo isopre- 
noid precursor geranyl pyrophosphate to olefins of the var- 
ious skeletal types (Fig. 1) (Gijzen et al., 1991). The principal 
resin acid, (-)-abietic acid (Lewinsohn et ai., 1993b), is 
formed by cyclization of the corresponding Cz0 isoprenoid 
precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-abieta- 
7(8),13(14)-diene (LaFever et al., 1994), followed by sequen- 
tia1 oxidation of the A-ring a-methyl of the olefin to a 
carboxyl function involving two distinct Cyt P450-dependent 
hydroxylases and an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Fig. 1) (Funk 
and Croteau, 1994). This oxidation sequence resembles that 
involved in the conversion of (-)-kaurene to (-)-kaurenoic 
acid en route to GAs (Dennis and West, 1967; Murphy and 
West, 1969) and that involved in the production of 4-a- 
carboxy phytosterols as intermediates of the C4-demethyla- 
tion process (Pascal et al., 1993). 
To better understand the mechanisms regulating induced 
oleoresin formation, both oleoresin accumulation and the 
induction pattems of the monoterpene cyclases as well as the 
enzymes involved in abietic acid biosynthesis were examined 
after stem wounding in grand fir. Coordinate induction of 
the monoterpene cyclases, the diterpene cyclase, and the two 
Cyt P450-dependent diterpene hydroxylases was observed, 
consistent with the role of the monoterpenes as solvent for 
the diterpenoid resin acids in their migration to the wound 
site and their ultimate deposition to seal the injury.

Idaho (Moscow, ID) and were grown in standard potting mix 
(Sales Inc., Puyallup, WA) under controlled light (16 h day, 
200-300 pE m-* s-') and temperature (26OC day/l5OC night) 
conditions, and were watered daily and fertilized weekly 
(15:30:15, N:P:K) (Lewinsohn et al., 1991b). The saplings 
were allowed to grow under these conditions for at least 6 
weeks to fully break dormancy and were wounded at the 
indicated times prior to experimental use by making, with a 
razor blade, a series of I-mm-deep cuts, approximately 3 mm 
apart, along the entire stem on opposite sides (Lewinsohn et 
al., 1991a). 
The seed of these trees was collected from the wild (Sears 
Creek, Clearwater drainage area, near Harpster, ID, elevation 
1.1-1.4 km) and, over the course of many experiments, the 
derived saplings were shown to vary in constitutive cyclase 
levels and in the timing of onset and the maximum induci- 
bility of these enzymes, as well as in severa1 morphological 
characteristics. To " i z e  the effects of variation, the sa- 
plings were grown under conditions that avoided stresses 
known to influence the wound-induced response (Lewinsohn 
et al., 1993a), and a11 five enzyme assays and the analysis of 
oleoresin constituents were camed out for each time point 
with the same set of trees from a visually matched population. 
The preparations of [l-3H]geranyl pyrophosphate (122 Ci/ 
mol) and [ l-3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (122 Ci/mol) 
have been described (Croteau et al., 1994; LaFever et al., 
1994), as have the preparations of (-)-[18-3H]abieta- 
7(8),13( 14)-diene (1 17 Ci/mol), (-)-[ 18-3H]abieta- 
7(8),13(14)-dien-18-01 (117 Ci/mol), and (-)-[3H]abieta- 
7(8),13(14)-dien-18-a1 (Funk and Croteau, 1994). Sodium 
[1(2)-14C]acetate (51 Ci/mol) was obtained from Amersham 
and analytical silica gel sheets (0.2 mm) were purchased from 
Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY). Authentic (-)-abietic acid 
was obtained from Helix Biotech Corp. (Richmond, British 
Columbia, Canada) and was used to synthesize the corre- 
sponding abietadiene, abietadienol, and abietadienal by pro- 
Abietadiene Abietadienol Abietadlenal Abietic acid 
cedures previously described (Funk and Croteau, 1994). All 
other biochemicals and reagents were from Sigrrta or Aldrich 
Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI) unless othenvise noted. 
Conversion of ['4C]Acetic Acid to Oleoresin Components 
by Crand Fir Stem Tissue 
Grand fir saplings were harvested 9 d after wcxmding, the 
stems were cut into 2-mm-long sections, and a randomized 
sample (approximately 300 mg fresh weight, representing 
three stem sections from each of five saplings) was incubated 
for 12 h at 20°C in buffer containing 1 pCi of [1(2)-'4C]acetic 
acid as described previously (Funk and Croteau, 1994). A 
control incubation with stem sections from rionwounded 
saplings was also camed out, and to examine localization of 
oleoresin biosynthesis and attempt to " i z e  the adverse 
effect of the oleoresin on precursor uptake, debarked stem 
sections (containing principally xylem tissue) fram wounded 
and control saplings were also tested. In each case, intemal 
standards (20 pg each of abietadiene, abietadienol, abieta- 
dienal, and abietic acid) were added to the sarnples at the 
end of the incubation, the tissue was homogenized and 
extracted, and the products were quantified by l~quid scintil- 
lation spectrometry after separation by a conibmation of 
column chromatography and TLC as before (Funk and Cro- 
teau, 1994). 
Enzyme lsolation and Assay 
Saplings were harvested at the indicated times after 
wounding and, after remova1 of needles and branches, the 
stems were cut into 1-cm sections and homogenized in a 
Waring blender using the conditions and extraction buffer 
(approximately 4 mL/g tissue) previously described (Funk 
and Croteau, 1994). To minimize the influence 01: tree-to-tree 
variation, stem tissues from five individuals were pooled for 
the preparation of each homogenate, which was filtered and

centrifuged (12,00Og, 20 min) to give a supematant used as 
the enzyme source. Aliquots of this material were taken for 
the determination of total monoterpene synthase activity (the 
divalent cation-dependent conversion of [l-3H]geranyl py- 
rophosphate to a-pinene, P-pinene, 3-carene, 8-phellan- 
drene, limonene, and other olefins by a mixture of cyclases) 
using an assay previously described (Lewinsohn et al., 1991b) 
and for the determination of diterpene synthase activity (the 
divalent cation-dependent conversion of [ 1 -3H]geranylge- 
ranyl pyrophosphate to abietadiene [approximately 90%] and 
sandaracopimaradiene [approximately 9%]), also employing 
a previously described assay (LaFever et al., 1994). NAD- 
dependent abietadienal dehydrogenase activity was also 
measured with this preparation, as outlined previously, using 
rHIabietadiena1 as substrate (Funk and Croteau, 1994). For 
the detennination of Cyt P450-dependent abietadiene and 
abietadienol hydroxylase activities, microsomes were pre- 
pared from the above supematants by centrifugation at 
195,0008 (90 min) and the pellets were resuspended in hy- 
droxylase assay buffer for monitoring the conversion of 
fH]abietadiene to abietadienol, and of rHlabietadieno1 to 
abietadienal, by established methods (Funk and Croteau, 
1994). Each of the above assays is based on the transforma- 
tion of the appropriate substrate (tritium labeled on the A- 
ring a-substituent) to the corresponding, chromatographi- 
cally purified product, and involved duplicate measurements 
using two independent preparations (i.e. four assays per time 
point). Radioactivities were detennined by liquid scintillation 
spectrometry (3H efficiency = 40%, with counting error 4 % )  
and are reported, with SE values, on a protein basis. Protein 
concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford 
(1976) using the Bio-Rad dye-binding reagent and bovine 7- 
giobulin as standard. 
Oleoresin Analysis 
Stem sections (1-2 g fresh weight) of the same five 
wounded or control trees utilized for enzyme extraction at 
each time point were employed for oleoresin analysis by 
diethyl ether extraction and capillary GLC separation using 
intemal standardization and a previously developed protocol 
(Lewinsohn 'et al., 1993b). Monoterpene olefins, neutra1 di- 
terpenoids (abietadiene, abietadienol, and abietadienal), and 
resin acids (as methyl esters) were separated on the same 
column (0.25 rnm X 30 m, Superox FA) using the same 
conditions previously described for the combined analysis 
(Lewinsohn et al., 1993b). The identity of each resin com- 
ponent was verified by GLC-MS comparison of retention 
time and mass spectrum to those of the authentic standard. 
All determinations were made using two independent ex- 
tracts from different sets of five trees at each time point and 
are reported, with SE values, on a dry weight basis (subsample 
dried at SOOC).

Figure 2. Changes in the activities of the enzymes of monoterpene 
olefin and abietic acid biosynthesis in grand fir sapling stems in 
response to wounding. Relative enzyme activities of (A) total mon- 
oterpene cyclases (e) and abietadiene cyclase (O); (B) abietadiene 
hydroxylase (V) and abietadienol hydroxylase (0); and (C) abieta- 
dienal dehydrogenase (m) are plotted as a function of time after 
wounding. Specific activities (protein basis) at the time of stem 
wounding (O time = constitutive activities) were: monoterpene 
cyclases (40 f 6 pkatlg), abietadiene cyclase (11  f 4 pkatlg), 
abietadiene hydroxylase (1.3 f 0.2 pkatlg), abietadienol hydroxyl- 
ase (0.33 f 0.08 pkatlg), and abietadienal dehydrogenase (220 f 
40 pkatlg). 
curred over the 20-d time course. Activity peaked 10 d after 
wounding, then steadily declined. This induction in grand fir 
represents an enhancement of constitutive activities (primar- 
ily limonene cyclase) and the appearance of new cyclase 
activities that catalyze the conversion of geranyl pyrophos- 
phate to sabinene, 3-carene, a-pinene, j3-pinene, and other 
monoterpenes (Gijzen et al., 1991; Lewinsohn et al., 1991a). 
The major wound-inducible monoterpene cyclase of grand 
fir produces both (-)-a-pinene and (-)-P-pinene (Wagschal 
et al., 1991), and this enzyme is essentially absent in non- 
wounded stems (Gijzen et al., 1991). The pinene cyclase has 
been purified to homogeneity (Lewinsohn et al., 1992b) and 
used to generate polyclonal antibodies that were employed 
to demonstrate, by immunoblotting, that the wound-induced 
increase in total cyclase activity was the result of an increase 
in the corresponding cyclase proteins (Gijzen et al., 1992). 
A dramatic increase (approximately 400-fold) in the diter- 
pene synthase activity, catalyzing the cyclization of geranyl- 
geranyl pyrophosphate to abietadiene and small amounts 
(approximately 9%) of sandaracopimaradiene, was also ob- 
served upon stem wounding of grand fir (Fig. 2A). The 
pattem for the induction of diterpene (abietadiene) cyclase 
activity and its subsequent decline was essentially superim-

posable with that of the monoterpene cyclases, with a maxi- 
mum reached after 10 d followed by a decline to near control 
levels at 20 d after wounding. As with the monoterpene 
cyclases, no significant change was observed in diterpene 
cyclase activity in the nonwounded controls over the 20-d 
time course. The constitutive level of diterpene cyclase activ- 
ity is significantly lower than the level of monoterpene cy- 
clase activity in this tissue. 
The three sequential oxidation steps for the conversion of 
abietadiene to abietic acid (Fig. 1) are catalyzed by two 
microsomal Cyt P450 hydroxylases and a soluble aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (Funk and Croteau, 1994), and both Cyt P450 
hydroxylase activities were induced by wounding (Fig. 2B). 
' f i e  induction pattem for both enzymes followed closely 
those of the terpene cyclases, reaching a maximum at 10 d 
,%fter wounding with about a 7-fold increase for the abi- 
citadiene hydroxylase and about a 60-fold increase for the 
abietadienol hydroxylase relative to the controls; the kinetics 
of activity decline were also similar to those of the cyclases. 
l'n contrast to the microsomal hydroxylases, the soluble abie- 
tadienal dehydrogenase activity was not induced by stem 
wounding, but was expressed constitutively at a relatively 
high level (Fig. 2C). The slight decrease in dehydrogenase 
specific activity over time may result from changes in protein 
concentration in response to wounding; no significant change 
in specific activity of the dehydrogenase, or of the two 
hydroxylases, was observed in the nonwounded control 
stems over this time period. 
The nearly superimposable induction of activity for the 
monoterpene cyclases, the diterpene cyclase, and the two Cyt 
P450 diterpenoid hydroxylases in response to wounding in- 
dicates that these enzymes are regulated in concerted fashion 
in the process of induced oleoresin formation. Such coordi- 
nate induction of monoterpene and resin acid biosynthesis is 
of functional significance in this defense response in provid- 
ing a solvent (turpentine) for the mobilization of the resin 
acids. Thus, after physical injury, such as bark beetle pene- 
tration of the stem, the co-induction of both classes of ter- 
penoids pennits the flow of oleoresin to and the saturation 
of the wound site, creating a most inhospitable environment 
for both beetle and pathogenic funga1 symbiont vectored by 
the beetle. In a sufficiently vigorous response, the oleoresin 
will immobilize and kill the beetle and fungus and expel both 
from the bore hoie (Gijzen et al., 1993; Nebeker et al., 1993). 
Upon reaching the exterior of the stem, the volatile monoter- 
pene olefins evaporate and the remaining resin acids crystal- 
lize and undergo oxidative polymerization in the presence of 
light and oxygen to generate an impermeable physical bamer 
that seals the wound (Croteau and Johnson, 1985). The 
operation of this nove1 defense strategy is clearly dependent 
on the co-production of both turpentine and rosin compo- 
nents of the oleoresin. The apparent, coordinated decline in 
enzyme activity levels may indicate similar stabilities of these 
biosynthetic catalysts or a more directed process of enzyme 
deactivation once wound sealing is under way. 
Biosynthesis of (-)-Abietic Acid from [14C]Acetate 
Previous indications that the activities of abietadiene hy- 
droxylase and abietadienol hydroxylase, as measured by in 
vitro assay, were too low to account for the accumulation of 
abietic acid in grand fii were attributed to the inefficient 
extraction of these microsomal enzymes from woody tissue 
and the poor stability of these Cyts P450 once isolated (Funk 
and Croteau, 1994). Nevertheless, the low specif ~c activity of 
these two hydroxylation steps relative to the initial cyclization 
to abietadiene and the final oxidation catalyzetl by abieta- 
dienal dehydrogenase (see legend to Fig. 2) suggested the 
possibility that the intermediate hydroxylations vrere, in fact, 
slow steps of the abietic acid biosynthesis pathway and of 
potential regulatory significance. To gain a better imderstand- 
ing of flux through the resin acid pathway that rnight reveal 
rate-limiting steps, the incorporation of ['4C]ace;ic acid into 
abietic acid and its precursors was examined in stem sections 
from wounded and control saplings. 
[I4C]Acetic acid (1 pCi) was administered to stem discs 
from both wounded (9 d) and control grand fir ,japlings for 
12 h and the relevant diterpenoid products were extracted 
and chromatographically purified. Radiolabel was incorpo- 
rated into a11 of the intermediates of the abietic acid pathway 
in both wounded and control tissue, but the major interme- 
diate accumulated was abietadienal (Table I) rather than 
abietadiene and abietadienol, as anticipated from the in vitro 
enzyme activity measurements. If it is assumed that the 
labeled intermediates are in equilibrium with intemal pools, 
the indicated pool sizes suggest that the in vitro assays 
significantly underestimate the in vivo activities of the Cyt 
P450 hydroxylases, and that while the cyclase and the hy- 
droxylases seem closely coupled, the microsomiil enzymes 
and the operationally soluble aldehyde dehydrogenase are 
not, resulting in the accumulation of abietadienal. 
The presence of oleoresin, particularly in the fissue from 
wounded stems, can compromise the uptake of Iiibeled pre- 
cursors (Croteau et al., 1987) such that incorporation rates 
may not be a reliable indicator of resin biosynthesi:; measured 
analytically. For this reason, and to examine the location of 
the induced response, the above experiment was repeated 
with stem discs from which the bark and phloem containing

the resin blisters and much of the adhering resin had been 
removed. In this instance, the distribution of intermediates 
generated in wounded stem tissue and control was roughly 
similar to that observed previously, but the overall incorpo- 
ration was considerably lower in the debarked stem control 
than in the whole stem control (Table I). Since the control 
represents largely constitutive biosynthetic activity associated 
with the multicellular resin blisters that are located in the 
cortex, this result is not surprising because the cortex is 
removed in the debarking process (Lewinsohn et al., 1991a). 
That incorporation attributable to wounding increased signif- 
icantly in debarked tissue (principally xylem) relative to con- 
trol tissue indicated an adverse effect of the resin on precursor 
incorporation and, moreover, suggested that the induced 
response was in large part associated with the xylem in which 
schizogenic resin cavities and traumatic resin ducts eventually 
form after injury (Wong and Benyman, 1977; Blanchette, 
1992). Increased incorporation of 14C02 into resin acids has 
been demonstrated in wounded pines and is also accom- 
panied by structural modification of the resin ducts (Walter 
et al., 1989). 
Oleoresin Analysis 
To provide context for the foregoing in vitro and in vivo 
measurements, the time course of oleoresin accumulation 
following wounding was determined analytically by extrac- 
tion, methylation of the resin acids, and separation and 
quantification of the components by capillary GLC. The levels 
of intermediates of abietic acid biosynthesis were also ex- 
amined (Fig. 3). Monoterpene olefins did not accumulate in 
wounded saplings but actually decreased in content through 
the early time course, due to the rapid volatilization of these 
turpentine components from the wound sites (Fig. 3B) as 
previously demonstrated by headspace trapping experiments 
(Lewinsohn et al., 1993a). Although considerable variation 
was observed among individual trees in both total level and 
composition of resin acids, the time course of accumulation 
of these products after stem wounding was entirely consistent 
with the time-dependent increase in abietic acid biosynthetic 
capacity measured by in vitro assay of the relevant enzymes 
(Fig. 2). A similar accumulation of resin acids at stem wound 
sites has been observed in pine species (Walter et al., 1989). 
The rosin fraction of grand fir oleoresin comprises roughly 
equal amounts of abietic acid and the derived dehydroabietic 
acid (Croteau et al., 1987), together totaling more than 80%, 
with lesser amounts of neoabietic acid and levopimaric acid 
(Lewinsohn et al., 1993b). Abietic acid and related dienoic 
acids are most prone to autooxidative polymerization, 
whereas dehydroabietic acid is the more viscous and highly 
crystalline (Enoki, 1976). A flow of viscous, semi-solid resin 
is considered most effective against bark beetle advancement 
and aids entrapment (Hodges et al., 1979). This essential 
property of oleoresin is imparted by solvation of the resin 
acids in the co-produced turpentine that, on evaporation, also 
serves to deposit the resin acids at the wound exterior to form 
a hardened seal. 
The two diterpenoid intermediates, abietadiene (25 & 5 pg/ 
g) and abietadienal (39 f 4 pg/g), were readily detected in 
control tissue (i.e. constitutive levels at time zero of Fig. 3); 
Figure 3. Relative levels of monoterpene olefins and diterpenoid 
resin acids accumulated in grand fir sapling stems in response to 
wounding. The content of the intermediates of abietic acid biosyn- 
thesis (A) abietadiene (O), abietadienol (m), and abietadienal (A), 
and (B) total monoterpene olefins (+) and total resin acids (V), are 
plotted as a function of time after wounding. lnitial levels (dry 
weight basis) at the time of stem wounding (O time = constitutive 
levels) were: abietadiene (25 f 5 pg/g), abietadienol (<1 pg/g; 
because of this low level, d 8 [21 f 3 pg/g] was taken as the base), 
abietadienal (39 f 4 pg/g), resin acids (1250 f 250 pg/g), and 
monoterpene olefins (8800 f 900 pg/g). 
however, the level of abietadienol was near the lower limit 
of detectability (approximately 1 pg/g). These levels (about 
5% of the rosin fraction) are consistent with the low levels of 
resin acid intermediates generally found in conifer resin 
(Norin, 1972; Rowe et al., 1972). After wounding, the levels 
of a11 three intermediates began to increase at about d 7, at 
the onset of resin acid accumulation, and a11 three exhibited 
a similar time course (Fig. 3). That the absolute level of 
abietadienal was the highest of the three biosynthetic inter- 
mediates is consistent with the ['*C]acetate incorporation 
experiments in suggesting that the final step of abietic acid 
formation is not very efficiently coupled to the earlier steps 
of the pathway, perhaps because of compartmentation ef- 
fects. In any case, it is not clear from the data now available 
why the operationally soluble abietadienal dehydrogenase, 
which is seemingly expressed constitutively at a high level, 
should behave differently than the other enzymes of mono- 
terpene and diterpene biosynthesis, which are co-induced at 
the site of injury in the process of oleoresin formation. 
Interpretation of these latter observations could be compli- 
cated by the possibility that the total aldehyde dehydrogenase 
activity measured represents a mixture of enzymes, some of 
which simply utilize abietadienal as an adventitious substrate. 
An interesting feature of wound-induced oleoresinosis is 
the slowness of the reaction relative to other inducible plant 
defense responses, which often occur over the course of a 
few days (Tallamy and Raupp, 1991) rather than a few weeks.

In considering the consequences of this delayed host re- 
sponse, which is typical of conifers (Berryman, 1972), it is 
important to note that conifers also possess constitutive de- 
fenses in the form of resin ducts and blisters. That both types 
of resin-based defense mechanisms seem to have been se- 
lected for in this group of plants is also most unusual. In the 
context of initiation of bark beetle attack in grand fir, the fir 
engraver (Scolytus ventrulis Le Conte) is of greatest signifi- 
cance as a forest pest (Struble, 1957). Under favorable con- 
ditions, where constitutive defenses are avoided, pioneering 
engraver females bore through the bark to the cambium- 
sapwood interface, where they excavate a nuptial chamber 
and initiate construction of egg galleries, a process that occurs 
over severa1 weeks (Berryman and Ashraf, 1970). It is over 
this 1- to 2-week period, when the induced production of the 
toxic and viscous oleoresin is most intense, that most attacks 
are, in fact, abandoned (Berryman and Ashraf, 1970). There- 
fore, the extended time course of the induced response is 
appropriate to the time scale of attack initiation and may 
represent an adaptive strategy. Thus, the time invested in an 
unsuccessful attempt at gallery construction constitutes a 
significant fraction of the beetles' flight dispersa1 period, and 
such delay in locating a suitable host could serve to disrupt 
subsequent mate selection and synchronization of the mass 
attacks often required to overcome the tree defenses. Berry- 
man (1969) has noted that an even slower response has the 
greatest impact on fir engraver populations via resin-based 
killing of eggs and larvae after an apparently successful 
colonization attempt.
