1RESUMO: “Atividade tripanocida de flavonoides e limonoides isolados de extratos ativos 
de plantas de Myrsinaceae e Meliaceae”. A atividade de extratos brutos de três espécies de 
Rapanea (Myrsinaceae) e de Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) foi avaliada in vitro contra formas 
tripomastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi. Foram obtidos 33 extratos de diferentes órgãos das espécies 
estudadas, sendo que onze deles apresentaram atividades significantes (% de lise > 50) nos ensaios 
realizados. O fracionamento de um extrato ativo dos galhos de R. lancifolia (99,5%) resultou 
no isolamento de dois flavonoides (quercetina e taxifolina), que apresentaram baixa atividade 
tripanocida. De um extrato ativo dos frutos de C. fruticosa (97,7%) foram isolados os limonoides 
mexicanolídeos cipadesina, mexicanolídeo, febrifugina e cipadesina A, que foram moderadamente 
ativos sobre T. cruzi. Além disso, outros dois flavonoides (flavona e 7-metoxiflavona), previamente 
ensaiados contra T. cruzi, foram isolados do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C. fruticosa (100%). 
Os resultados obtidos aqui sugerem que as plantas avaliadas podem constituir fontes de novas 
substâncias ativas sobre o T. cruzi.

ABSTRACT: The activity of crude extracts of three Rapanea species (Myrsinaceae) and Cipadessa 
fruticosa (Meliaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma 
cruzi. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them 
showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of R. 
lancifolia (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolin, which have weak 
trypanocidal activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of C. fruticosa (97.7%) afforded 
mexicanolide limonoids: cipadesin, mexicanolide, febrifugin and cipadesin A, that were slightly 
active on T. cruzi. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously 
assayed against T. cruzi, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa 
(100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active 
compounds against T. cruzi.
Keywords: Myrsinaceae, Meliaceae, trypanocidal activity, flavonoids, limonoids.

INTRODUCTION
 Chagas’ disease (American trypanosomiasis) 
affects 16-18 million people, mostly from Central and 
South America, where 25% of the total population is at 
risk of infection (WHO, 2004). It is caused by a flagellate 
protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to 
humans by blood-sucking triatomine insects and by blood 
transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect 
vector (Triatoma infestans), infected blood transfusion is 
becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease 
(Dias, 1993). The only trypanocidal substance currently 
used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, 
but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the 
patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas’ disease 
is still a challenge, since the only current available drug 
(benznidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). 
Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is 
needed to control this disease.
 In the past years, the study of compounds isolated 
from plants has received considerable attention in the 
search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases 
(Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have 
been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007; 
2Guimarães & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants 
of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed in 
vitro activity against T. cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira 
et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 
2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising 
source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas’ 
disease. 
 In this paper, we report the results of the evaluation 
of in vitro trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from 
different organs of Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, 
R. umbelata Myrsinaceae, and Cipadessa fruticosa 
Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity 
of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches 
of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa, as well the activity of four 
limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from 
fruits of C. fruticosa.

giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the 
same conditions to yield compounds 1 (3.2 mg) and 2 (3.7 
mg). 
 The hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of C. 
fruticosa (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum 
liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-
CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction 
(6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 
hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. 
Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-
CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 
5 was three times chromatographed through column 
chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-
MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and 8 
(8.2 mg). 
 The dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 
g) of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted 
to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a 
hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the 
fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt 
(1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/
AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as 
following described: the fraction CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 
g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on 
silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, 
and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble 
fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from 
the last fractionation was several times chromatographed 
on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to 
afford for limonoids 3 (19.4 mg), 5 (8.1 mg), and 6 (8.5 
mg). Limonoid 4 (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction 
EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several 
chromatographies on silica gel.
 Compounds 1-6 were identified through 1H and 
13C NMR spectra, 1H - 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC 
experiments and MS. The spectral data of 1 and 2 were in 
agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 
1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids 
3 (Luo et al., 2000), 4 (Paula, 1996), 5 (Govindachari & 
Kumari, 1998) and 6 (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, 
compounds 7 and 8 were characterized by comparison of 
13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 
1975). The in vitro activity on T. cruzi of compounds 3 
- 6 is described herein. On the other hand, the activities 
of compounds 1, 2, 7 and 8 were previously reported 
(Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006).
Bioassay
 The bioassays were carried out according to 
the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The 
activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 
4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 µg/
mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite 
number (lysis) and IC
50 
(µmol/L) for compounds 3-6 were 
calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 In this work, we assessed the trypanocidal 
activity of 33 extracts of three Myrsinaceae and one 
Meliaceae species (Table 2). Eleven of them (33%) 
showed significant activity (lysis % > 50) at 4 mg/mL 
against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. The majority 
of the extracts of C. fruticosa presented relevant activity. 
The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from 
branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH) that reduced 100% of 
the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the 
three Rapanea species assayed did not present significant 
results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the 
parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some 
extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity 
without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane 
extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH).
 Similar studies involving the trypanocidal activity 
of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported 
by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; 
Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these 
plants can be considered a promising source of active 
compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. 
Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of 
C. fruticosa are consistent with those previously reported 
for this family. 
 The investigation of the methanol fraction of 
the active hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia 
(RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin (1)

and the dihydrofl avonol taxifolin (2). Several biological activities have been reported for these fl avonoids. Quercetin 
(1), for example, presented antiprotozoal effect against Plasmodium falciparum (IC
50
 = 14 µM), Trypanosoma brucei 
brucei (IC
50
 = 13.2 µM), Leishmania donovani (IC
50
 = 63.8 µM) (Camacho et al., 2002), T. brucei and T. rhodesiense 
(Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract 
from Lychnophora pinaster, Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high 
leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds 1 and 2 were previously 
assayed on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the 
original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them.
 The mexicanolide limonoids 3-6, isolated from 
fruits of C. fruticosa, showed signifi cant trypanocidal 
activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very 
active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 
97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids 
(Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. 
Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude 
extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) 
enzyme from T. cruzi. The results showed that crude 
extracts from C. fruticosa showed high ability to inhibit 
the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this 
specie could be considered as a promising source of 
lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. In addition, 
the extracts from C. fruticosa showed high inhibition of 
adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme 
from Leishmania that has been proposed as a target for the 
rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et 
al., 2005b).

Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts
 The trypanocidal activity of flavone (7) and 
7-methoxyflavone (8), isolated from the active hexane 
extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH), was 
previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They 
showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active 
fraction of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (Rutaceae), 
presented low activity against trypomastigote forms 
of T. cruzi (IC
50
 = 2116 and 787 µg/mL or 9531 and 
1084 µmol/L, respectively) when compared with other 
flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). 
Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract 
CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites 
of C. fruticosa. As limonoids in the present work showed 
trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH 
extract may be associated with these compounds.

the Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae plants constitute a 
potential source of active compounds for treatment 
of Chagas’ disease. The phytochemical study of three 
active extracts of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa led to the 
isolation of quercetin (1), taxifolin (2), flavone (7) and 
7-methoxyflavone (8), which had showed weak activity 
against the trypomatigote forms of T. cruzi, and cipadesin 
(3), febrigufin (4), mexicanolide (5), and cipadesin A (6) 
that were appreciably actives. In addition, the trypanocidal 
activity of plants of Myrsinaceae family and limonoids 3-6 
are been disclosed for the first time.
