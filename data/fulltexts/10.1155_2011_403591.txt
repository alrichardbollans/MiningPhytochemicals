Although GABA neurotransmission has been suggested as a mechanism for Valeriana oﬃcinalis eﬀects, CNS depression can also
be evoked by inhibition of ionotropic (iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). In this study, we examined if
aqueous valerian extract interacted with glutamatergic receptors. Freshly prepared aqueous valerian extract was incubated with
rat cortical synaptic membranes in presence of 20nM [3H]Glutamate. Aqueous valerian extract increased [3H]Glutamate binding
from 1 × 10
−7 to 1 × 10
−3 mg/mL. In the presence of (2S,1 S,2 S)-2-(Carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (LCCG-I) and (2S,2 R,3 R)-
2-(2 ,3 -Dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV), Group II mGluR agents, valerian extract markedly decreased [3H]Glutamate
binding, while (2S)-2-amino-3-(3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazolidin-2-yl) propanoic acid) (quisqualic acid, QA), Group I mGluR
agonist, increased [3H]Glutamate binding. At 0.05mg/mL aqueous valerian extract speciﬁcally interacted with kainic acid NMDA
and AMPA receptors. Valerenic acid, a marker compound for Valeriana oﬃcinalis, increased the [3H]Glutamate binding after
1.6 ×10
−2 mg/mL, and at 0.008mg/mL it interacted only with QA (Group I mGluR). The selective interactions of valerian extract
and valerenic acid with Group I and Group II mGluR may represent an alternative explanation for the anxiolytic properties of this
plant.
1.Introduction
Valeriana oﬃcinalis L., s.l. (Valerianaceae family) is a medic-
inal plant used in complementary and alternative medicine
for its sedative and anxiolytic properties [1, 2]. Valerian’s
eﬀects on the central nervous system have been well doc-
umented and attributed to many of it active compounds:
valepotriates, baldrinals, valerenic acid, valerenal and valer-
anone, and other constituents in the essential oils [1, 3–8].
Albeittheanxiolyticpropertiesofvalerianhavebeendemon-
s t r a t e di na n i m a l s[ 9, 10], there are no suﬃcient studies
in humans [6]. Consequently, the therapeutic properties of
Valeriana oﬃcinalis have yet to be conclusively demonstrated
[6, 9, 11].
“Anxiety and stress-related diseases are a group of
disorders that have in common excessive or inappropriate
brain excitability within crucial brain circuits” [12]. The
actions of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter,
are mediated by two types of receptors: (1) ionotropic
receptors (iGluR): NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors and
(2) metabotropic receptors (mGluR) which are comprised
of three groups (I, II, and III). Decreasing excitatory

The present study investigated the interaction of Vale-
riana oﬃcinalis aqueous extract with the glutamatergic
receptors. We also examined the interaction of valerenic acid2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
and isoborneol, two constituents present in the extracts.
To accomplish this objective, receptor-binding assays were
performedusingratcorticalsynapticmembranesinthepres-
ence of fresh valerian extracts and both types of glutamate
receptor ligands.

2.2. Valerian Extracts. Valeriana oﬃcinalis L., s.l. dry pow-
dered roots (Lot. 1111H-OUP), harvested in 2004 and
organically grown/certiﬁed, were obtained from Paciﬁc
Botanicals (LLC Grants Pass, Oregon). Valerian was
extracted in ultra pure water, typically (1:10w/v) at ∼23◦C
and stirred for 1 hour. Aliquots were centrifuged at 6,700g to
remove particulates.

Figure 2: Eﬀects of valerian extracts, valerenic acid, and isoborneol on ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR). (a) Valerian extract at
0.05mg/ml in presence of 1mM kainic acid (KA) decreased the glutamate binding signiﬁcantly. This eﬀect was not seen with NMDA or
AMPA. High concentrations of valerian extract (10mg/ml) in presence of NMDA (1mM) signiﬁcantly decreased the glutamate binding.

binding, reaching 50% at 12mg/mL. In contrast, valerenic
acid and isoborneol increased [3H]Glutamate binding at
higher concentrations (1.6 ×10

3.2. In Vitro Receptor Selectivity Studies. Having shown
that Valeriana oﬃcinalis and it constituents interacted with
[3H]Glutamate binding, we examined the type of gluta-

were done in presence of diﬀerent types of ionotropic
(iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)
ligands.Figure 2(a)showsthatValerianextractat0.05mg/ml

Metabotropic glutamate receptor interactions

Figure 3: Interactions of valerian extracts, valerenic acid, and isoborneol on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). (a) At lower
concentrations of valerian extract (0.05mg/mL) in presence of LCCG-I, a Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, there was
a marked decrease in the binding. This eﬀect was not seen with QA and L-AP4. Valerian extracts at 10mg/mL, in presence of both QA
and LCCG-I, signiﬁcantly decreased the glutamate binding. ((a)-Insert) A marked decrease in the [3H]Glutamate binding was observed
when valerian extracts (0.001mg/mL) were in the presence of DCG-IV and EGLU, a Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist
and antagonist, respectively. (b) Valerenic acid concentration at 0.008mg/mL, in the presence of QA, a Group I metabotropic glutamate
receptor agonist, produced a signiﬁcant increase in the binding. No eﬀects were observed in presence of DCG-IV, LCCG-I, EGLU, and L-
AP4. (c) Isoborneol, at 0.0008 and 1mg/mL increased [3H]Glutamate binding by 49% and 64%, respectively. Isoborneol in the presence of

(EGLU). Isoborneol also strongly interacted with L-AP4 at both concentrations (0.0008mg/mL and 1mg/mL) and resulted in an increased

increased the [3H]Glutamate binding signiﬁcantly (20%).
Valerian (10mg/mL) did not interact with AMPA or KA.
The same assay was performed with 0.008mg/mL of
valerenic acid, and it showed (Figure 2(b)) that valerenic
acid decreased the [3H]Glutamate binding more than 40%.
However, valerenic acid did not change the eﬀects of iGluR
ligands on [3H]Glutamate binding. In contrast, Figure 2(c)
shows that isoborneol (0.0008mg/mL) only interacted with
NMDA. At higher concentrations (1mg/mL) isoborneol
interacted with AMPA and KA.
As shown in Figure 3(a), valerian extract (0.05mg/mL)
increased [3H]Glutamate binding by 81%, while at 10
mg/mL, it decreased the binding by 28%. Valerian extract
(0.05mg/mL) in presence of LCCG-I, a Group II meta-
botropic glutamate receptor agonist, decreased (19%)
[3H]Glutamate binding. This eﬀect was not observed withEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5
QA or L-AP4. In contrast, at 10mg/mL, the valerian extract,
in presence of QA, increased the glutamate binding (28%),
while in presence of LCCG-I, it decreased [3H]Glutamate
binding by 16%. A detailed evaluation of Group II mGluR-

decrease in the [3H]Glutamate binding when valerian
extracts (0.001mg/mL) were in presence of DCG-IV (28%)
and EGLU (38%), a highly selective Group II metabotropic
glutamate receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively.
In presence of QA, valerenic acid (0.008mg/mL) sig-
niﬁcantly increased the [3H]Glutamate binding by 54%
as shown in Figure 3(b). Similarly, isoborneol at 0.0008
and 1mg/mL increased [3H]Glutamate binding by 49%
and 64%, respectively (Figure 3(c)). Interestingly, isoborneol
indiscriminately interacted with all the mGluR ligands,
and at 0.0008mg/mL, isoborneol interacted with QA and
markedly decreased (14%) [3H]Glutamate binding. In addi-
tion, isoborneol interacted with all the mGluR agonists
(LCCG-I, DCG-IV and spaglumic) and antagonist (EGLU).
Isoborneol also strongly interacted with L-AP4 at both
concentrations(0.0008mg/mLand1mg/mL)andresultedin
an increased [3H]Glutamate binding (37% and 46%, resp.).
4. Discussion
Among 150 potentially active phytochemicals, constituents
identiﬁed in the Valerian’s roots are (1) iridoid valepotriates
(0.5%–2.0%): valtrate, isovaltrate, didrovaltrate, acevaltrate
and others and (2) volatile essential oil (0.2%–2.8%) divided
in (a) monoterpenes: borneol and bornyl acetate and (b)
sesquiterpenes: valerenic, valeric, isovaleric and acetoxy-
valerenic acids: valerenal, valeranone, and kessyl glycol [14,
15]. Some sesquiterpenes, such valerenic acid, inﬂuence
serotonin and noradrenaline levels, reduce locomotion, and
anxiety, and increase pentobarbital sleeping time of mice
[16, 17]. Similarly, other constituents, such as valepotri-
ates potentiate hexobarbital anesthesia, suppress aggression,
have anticonvulsant eﬀects against pentylenetetrazole- and
strychnine-induced seizures, increase thiopental sleeping
time, reduce motility, and have dose-dependent sedative
eﬀects [17–19]. In addition, valepotriates and their decom-
position products, baldrinals and homobaldrinals, reduced
the total HAM-A (Hamilton anxiety scale) in a small clinical
trial [20] and increased the time spent in open arms when
elevatedplusmazetestwasperformedinrats[19].Therefore,
itismostlikelythatvalerian’spharmacologicalpropertiesare
due to the additive eﬀects of multiple active constituents and
not one alone [21].
Most of the Valerian eﬀects described above are con-
sistent with the enhancement of GABAa-mediated trans-
mission [7, 22–24]. Cavadas and colleagues showed that
valerian extracts bind to GABAa receptors [4], while other
researchers found that valerian is a partial agonist of
the 5-HT(5a) receptor [8] and promotes cell proliferation
in the hippocampus of “depressive” rats [25]. Moreover,
recent studies suggest that diﬀerent components within the
valerianextractmediatetheactivationofadenosinereceptors
[26, 27]. Indeed, many studies have been done to determine
the interaction of valerian with diﬀerent receptors, but none
of them examined valerian-glutamate receptor interaction.
Our [3H]Glutamate displacement curve in presence
of Valeriana oﬃcinalis demonstrated that valerian extracts
increase glutamate binding from 8×10
−7 to 1×10
−1 mg/mL
reaching a maximum 3[H]Glutamate binding at 1 ×
10
−3mg/mL (160%). Therefore, at these physiological
attainableconcentrations(8×10
−7–1×10
−1mg/mL)valerian
potentiates 3[H]Glutamate binding. In contrast, diﬀerent
ﬁndings were obtained for valerenic acid and isoborneol.
The [3H]Glutamate displacement curves and the receptor
selectivity obtained for valerian and its constituents, for
instance, are very diﬀerent from each other, suggesting that
these constituents are not the compounds responsible for the
increase in 3[H]Glutamate binding observed with valerian.
The glutamatergic system plays an important role in
anxiety pathogenesis [28]. It is suggested that the physio-
logical and behavioral responses associated with anxiety are
regulated by a balance between the inhibition produced by
GABA and the excitation caused by glutamate. Treatments
used to decrease excitability in neurons from the amyg-
dala are achieved by increasing GABA neurotransmission.
Alternatively, treatments to decrease the excitability can be
obtained by decreasing the excitatory glutamatergic trans-
mission. Therefore, decreasing excitatory neurotransmission
intheCNS,bymodulatingtheresponseproducedbytheglu-
tamatergic receptors, is an alternative approach to produce
anxiolysis and sedation. The glutamate receptors found in
the amygdala produce excitatory and inhibitory actions, and
the degree of ionotropic and metabotropic activation is an
important factor to determine the amygdala cell excitability.
Thus, the modulation of glutamate actions mediated by
iGluR and mGluR represent a feasible alternative to treat
anxiety states [12, 29].
Compounds that decrease glutamatergic transmission
via blockade of NMDA have been reported to produce
anxiolytic and antidepressant like actions in animal tests
and models [30, 31]. Our group demonstrated that vale-
rian extract had modest inhibitory eﬀects on [3H]MK-801
binding, an indicator of NMDA-valerian interaction [32].
In 2004, Malva and colleagues reported that by decreasing
neuronal network excitability through AMPA permeable
Ca2+ receptors, valerian preparations could contribute to
neuroprotection and may be of therapeutic use in preventing
glutamate-mediated degeneration related to aging or neu-
rodegenerative disorders [33]. Now, our study conﬁrms that
in the presence of iGluR agonists, valerian extracts interact
with KA and NMDA (0.05mg/mL and 10mg/mL, resp.).
While isoborneol exhibited signiﬁcant interactions with all
iGluR, valerenic acid did not interact with iGluR agonists.
Manystudiessuggestthatmetabotropicglutamaterecep-
tors are involved in anxiety [12, 34–36]. For this reason,
we performed receptor-binding assays with valerian extracts
in presence of diﬀerent types of metabotropic glutamate
receptors. In this study, we demonstrated that valerian
extracts, in presence of mGluR ligands, exhibited signiﬁcant
interaction with QA (Group I mGluR) and LCCG-I (Group
II mGluR). Valerenic acid selectively interacts with QA.
However, isoborneol interacts with all mGluR receptors. Our6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
results clearly demonstrated that Valeriana oﬃicinalis and
it constituents (valerenic acid and isoborneol) interact with
Group I and II mGluR, which supports previous studies
showingtheroleofGroupIandIImGluRinanxiety[35,37].
The pharmacological eﬀects of Valeriana oﬃcinalis
extracts in [3H]Glutamate binding are not conventional and
easy to understand. They could reﬂect complex interactions
(agonist/antagonist) or synergism occurring in the com-
plex mixture of phytochemical constituents. The biphasic
[3H]Glutamate displacement curve obtained in presence
of valerian represents an example of the interactions that
occur in an extract which could not be evident when single
constituents are studied in isolation. This study exclusively
used receptor-binding assays to determine ligand-receptor
interactions, but functionalities studies are being conducted
to characterize them.
Ourresultsconﬁrmthehypothesisofvalerianinteraction
with the glutamatergic receptors, suggesting a possible
mechanism by which valerian extracts produce their eﬀects.
Val-mGluR interactions may represent a novel alternative for
