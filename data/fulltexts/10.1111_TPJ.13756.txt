Identification and functional characterization of diterpene synthases for triptolide 
biosynthesis from Tripterygium wilfordii 
Abstract 
Tripterygium wilfordii has long been used as a medicinal plant, and exhibits impressive and effective anti-
inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-tumor activities. The main active ingredients are diterpenoids 
and triterpenoids, such as triptolide and celastrol, respectively. A major challenge to harnessing these 
natural products is that they are found in very low amounts in planta. Access has been further limited by 
the lack of knowledge regarding the underlying biosynthetic pathways, particularly for the abeo-abietane 
tri-epoxide lactone triptolide. Here suspension cell cultures of T. wilfordii were found to produce triptolide 
in an inducible fashion, with feeding studies indicating that miltiradiene is the relevant abietane olefin 
precursor. Subsequently, transcriptome data was used to identify eight putative (di)terpene synthases 
that were then characterized for their potential involvement in triptolide biosynthesis. This included not 
only biochemical studies that revealed the expected presence of class II diterpene cyclases that produce 
the intermediate copalyl diphosphate (CPP), along with the more surprising finding of an atypical class I 
(di)terpene synthase that acts on CPP to produce the abietane olefin miltiradiene, but also their sub-
cellular localization and, critically, genetic analysis. In particular, RNA interference targeting either both of 
the CPP synthases, TwTPS7v2 & TwTPS9v2, or the subsequently acting miltiradiene synthase, 
TwTPS27v2, led to decreased production of triptolide. Importantly, these results then both confirm that 
miltiradiene is the relevant precursor and the relevance of the identified diterpene synthases, enabling 
future studies of the biosynthesis of this important bioactive natural product.

INTRODUCTION
Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f., commonly known as Lei Gong Teng in Chinese, has been 
used for centuries, mainly to treat rheumatoid arthritis (Tu, 2009). While the genus 
Tripterygium is known to produce many types of terpenoids, the major bioactive compounds 
in T. wilfordii seem to be diterpenoids, especially triptolide, a tri-epoxide lactone first 
identified by Kupchan et al. (1972), and related compounds. These natural products have 
aroused extensive interest due to their broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory, 
immunosuppressive, anti-cystogenesis, and anticancer activities (Tao and Lipsky, 2000; 
Gong et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Leuenroth et al., 2010; Titov et al., 2011; Manzo et al., 
2012; Chugh et al., 2012). In addition, triptolide exerts effects on central nervous system 
diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s (Li et al., 2003, 2004; Gao et al., 2008; Nie et 
al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013). However, these diterpenoids currently are exclusively derived 
from Tripterygium plants, with low yields, limiting our ability to investigate and apply these 
bioactive compounds. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways for these complex 
diterpenoids would enable increased access via metabolic engineering, either in the native 
plant or using a synthetic biology approach to introduce the pathway into a microbial host.
Triptolide is an abietane-type diterpenoid, which places it in the labdane-related super-
family that is characterized by formation of the underlying hydrocarbon backbone from the 
general diterpenoid precursor (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by a sequential 
pair of cyclization reactions (Peters, 2010). These are catalyzed firstly by class II diterpene 
cyclases, which contain a characteristic DxDD motif, and then subsequently acting class I 
diterpene synthases that contain a separate DDxxD motif instead (Peters, 2010). Despite 
their distinct catalytic activity, catalyzed in separate active sites defined by the noted motifs 
(Gao et al., 2012), these enzymes are both members of the terpene synthase (TPS) family, 
with the class II diterpene cyclases making up the TPS-c sub-family and subsequently acting 
class I diterpene synthases comprising the TPS-e sub-family (Chen et al., 2011).
More specifically, triptolide is presumably produced via initial cyclization of GGPP to 
copalyl diphosphate (CPP), with subsequent cyclization and rearrangement to an abietane-
type diene olefin, which is then further transformed to triptolide. It has been suggested that 
this proceeds via the aromatized dehydroabietic acid, with subsequent 1,2-migration of the

carboxylic acid (from carbon 4 → 3) to form the observed abeo-abietane backbone (Kutney 
& Han, 1996). Notably, the cyclohexa-1,4-diene arrangement of the abietane miltiradiene 
poises this for aromatization (Gao et al., 2009), which readily occurs spontaneously (Zi & 
Peters, 2013). Thus, miltiradiene is a likely intermediate in triptolide biosynthesis (Figure 1).
Identification of the tissues where the compound of interest is produced and/or conditions 
that lead to increased accumulation can significantly aid elucidation of the underlying 
biosynthetic pathway. Consistent with previous results (Kutney et al., 1980), we have 
recently developed suspension cell cultures of T. wilfordii that produce triptolide and related 
diterpenoids, as well as the triterpenoid celastrol (Su et al., 2014). Here we report that 
feeding miltiradiene to these cultures increases triptolide production. In addition, we find 
that production of triptolide can be induced in these cultures, which were then subjected to 
RNA-Seq to generate a transcriptome. This dataset was mined to discover eight potential 
(di)terpene synthases, which were functionally characterized by sub-cellular localization and 
biochemical analysis, revealing two closely related CPP synthases (CPSs), TwTPS7v2 and 
TwTPS9v2, and a subsequently acting miltiradiene synthase, TwTPS27v2. Critically, RNA 
interference (RNAi) of TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS9v2, or TwTPS27v2, reduced triptolide 
production, confirming not only the role of miltiradiene as a precursor, but also of these 
diterpene synthases in biosynthesis of this important diterpenoid natural product.
RESULTS
Suspension cell cultures can be used to illuminate triptolide biosynthetic pathway
As previously reported (Su et al., 2014), we have established T. wilfordii suspension cell 
cultures. Critically, these were found to stably produce diterpenoids, particularly including 
triptolide, over a 3-year period. Briefly, these cultures were grown in defined medium in the 
dark at 25 °C on a rotary shaker and transferred to fresh medium every 18 d, with increases 
of 2.6-fold in the fresh weight of suspension cells over this time (Figure S1). These cultures 
were found to produce 53 ± 3 µg/g of triptolide in the suspension cells and 4.0 ± 0.2 mg/L in 
the medium (Figure 2C).
To compare the phytochemical complexity of these suspension cell cultures relative to whole 
plants, extracts from the cells and medium, as well as plant root, stem, leaf, and flower 
tissues, were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of 
flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS). The plant samples, especially those from the 
roots traditionally associated with medicinal use, were largely composed of a variety of 
alkaloids (e.g. wilforgine and wilforine), with relatively small amounts of diterpenoids, 
including triptolide. By contrast, the suspension cell cultures appear to selectively 
accumulate diterpenoids and triterpenoids rather than alkaloids. Indeed, the suspension 
cultures accumulated triptolide at a higher level than the native plant, and this was 
particularly prevalent in the media, which exhibits a relatively simple phytochemical profile 
that presumably would assist purification of triptolide and/or related diterpenoids. Thus, 
these cultures represent a potential source of these natural products for commercial 
production. Perhaps more relevant here, these cultures further provide a system for 
investigation of the underlying biosynthetic network. For example, potential intermediates

such as triptophenolide, triptinin B and triptoquinonide can be readily detected in the 
suspension cells (Table 1 and Figure 2).
Miltiradiene is a precursor to triptolide
Notably, miltiradiene, arguably the most likely olefin precursor to triptolide, was detectable 
in our suspension cell cultures (Figure S2). To further investigate the potential role of 
miltiradiene in triptolide biosynthesis, this abietane was fed to these cultures, which led to a 
statistically significant increase in triptolide accumulation relative to control cultures after 5 
d (Figure 3). Altogether, this indicated that miltiradiene does serve as a precursor to 
triptolide, such that a class I diterpene synthase producing this olefin should be involved in 
the biosynthesis of these diterpenoids.
Triptolide production is induced by methyl jasmonate
Previous work has indicated that the production of (di)terpenoid natural products can be 
induced by the defense signalling molecule methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is further 
useful for co-expression analysis. Indeed, the application of MeJA to T. wilfordii cell 
cultures led to increased production of triptolide, at least in the cells, as measured by UPLC 
analysis (Figure S3). Elevated levels of triptolide in MeJA-induced relative to control 
cultures were evident within 72 h, with even larger differences found in later time points – 
e.g., after 240 h triptolide levels were >3-fold higher, reaching just over 200 µg/g, in the 
induced suspension cells (Figure 4). While it seems worth mentioning that the ability to 
induce higher levels of triptolide may assist the potential use of these suspension cell 
cultures for larger-scale production of this and related diterpenoids, here this finding was 
used to assist elucidation of the underlying biosynthetic network.
Induced transcriptome of T. wilfordii
Based on the ability of MeJA to increase triptolide production, such induced suspension 
cells were subjected to deep transcriptome sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 
platform. In total, 12.68 Gb of clean sequence was obtained after adapter related reads, low 
quality reads and reads containing unknown bases were removed from the raw reads (Table 
S1). A total of 90,801 transcripts were assembled with a mean length of 1,053 bp and an 
N50 of 1,837 bp (Table S2 and Figure S4).
Functional annotation was carried out using multiple databases, specifically Nr (NCBI non-
redundant protein sequences), Nt (NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences), Pfam 
(Protein family), KOG/COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins), Swiss-Prot (A 
manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database), KO (KEGG Ortholog 
database) and GO (Gene Ontology). Relevant to triptolide biosynthesis, 27 unigenes 
potentially involved in such metabolism were found, including eight putative diterpene 
synthases, as defined by falling within either the TPS-c or TPS-e sub-families (Tables S3–4; 
Figure S5).
Cloning of putative diterpene synthases
To demonstrate the utility of the generated transcriptome for elucidation of triptolide 
biosynthesis, it was hypothesized that the diterpene synthases necessary for formation of

miltiradiene should be present – i.e., among those in the transcriptome. Sequence analysis 
indicated that full-length open reading frames (ORFs) were not present for all eight putative 
diterpene synthases. Thus, full-length sequences were obtained by 5’ and 3’ rapid 
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), also using RNA from induced suspension cells. This 
eventually led to cloning of cDNA for six distinct full-length diterpene synthases (Table S5).
The obtained putative diterpene synthases were subjected to phylogenetic analysis (Figures 5 
and S6–7). During the course of our studies reports appeared describing similar, although 
not exactly identical genes (Anderson-Ranberg et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2017a). These are 
presumably allelic to those identified here and, to be consistent with these recent reports, 
here we utilize nomenclature that reflects these presumed relationships. Four of those found 
here fall within the TPS-c sub-family and, hence, were expected to be class II diterpene 
cyclases. Three appeared to be allelic to previously identified genes and, accordingly, were 
named TwTPS7v2, TwTPS3v2, and TwTPS9v2, while the remaining gene was termed 
TwCPS2. However, in place of the highly conserved DxDD motif, TwCPS2 contains 
“DTDC311”, raising questions about its activity. The two remaining diterpene synthases fall 
within the TPS-e sub-family, which is anchored by the ent-kaurene synthases (KSs) required 
in vascular plants for gibberellin phytohormone metabolism, but also contains derived KS-
like (KSL) enzymes (Zi et al., 2014). One appeared to be allelic to a previously identified 
gene and, hence, was named TwTPS16v2, while the other appeared to be unique and was 
named TwKSL1.
Functional characterization of the putative class II diterpene cyclases
To determine the function of the putative class II diterpene cyclases, these were 
heterologously expressed in E. coli, and tested with GGPP as substrate via in vitro cell-free 
assays. For detection by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), phosphatase was 
added to the assays upon completion to dephosphorylate both the substrate GGPP and any 
product, such as CPP, yielding geranylgeraniol (GGOH) and copalol, respectively. The 
production of CPP was detected for TwTPS7v2, TwTPS3v2 and TwTPS9v2 by comparison 
to the known activity of a CPS from Salvia miltiorrhiza (SmCPS1; Gao et al., 2009) (Figure 
6A), while no activity was detected for TwCPS2. Thus, TwCPS2 appears to be an inactive 
pseudogene. Consistent with this hypothesis is both the phylogenetic distance of this from 
other (functional) members of the TPS-c sub-family, even within the Tripterygium genus 
(Figure 5), and the fact that the lack of activity goes beyond simple loss of the DxDD motif, 
as correcting this (i.e., by changing C311 to the Asp prototypically found at that position) 
did not restore any enzymatic activity to TwCPS2.
To determine the absolute stereochemistry of the CPP products of TwTPS7v2, TwTPS3v2 
and TwTPS9v2, these were coupled to stereospecific class I diterpene synthases. In 
particular, the miltiradiene synthase from S. miltiorhiza, SmMS (Gao et al., 2009), or KS 
from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtKS (Yamaguchi et al., 1998), which are specific for CPP or 
ent-CPP, respectively (Gao et al., 2009; Morrone et al., 2009). In vitro cell-free assays were 
carried out in all six possible pairings, with the production of miltiradiene observed in assays 
with SmMS and either TwTPS7v2 or TwTPS9v2, while ent-kaurene was only observed in 
assays with AtKS and TwTPS3v2 (Figure 6B). Thus, consistent with recently reported work

on their allelic variants (Anderson-Ranberg et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2017a), both 
TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS9v2 produce CPP, while TwTPS3v2 produces ent-CPP.
Functional characterization of putative class I diterpene synthases
To determine the function of the two putative class I diterpene synthases, they were 
recombinantly expressed in E. coli and subjected to in vitro cell-free assays in combination 
with either TwTPS7v2 or TwTPS3v2 (providing CPP or ent-CPP, respectively). Neither 
TwKSL1 or TwTPS16v2 produced miltiradiene. Instead, both were only active with ent-
CPP. Consistent with the very recently reported activity of its allelic variant (Hansen et al., 
2017a), TwTPS16v2 produced largely 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, along with small amounts 
of ent-kaurene (Figure S8), which was further confirmed by co-expressing this with 
TwTPS3v2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). TwKSL1 was found to produce a mixture 
of diterpenes, the major components of which were identified upon incorporation into a 
modular metabolic engineering system in E. coli (Cyr et al., 2007), and comparison to 
already characterized enzymes (Jia & Peters, 2016), as ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene and small 
amounts of 8α-hydroxy-ent-pimar-15-ene, as well as minor amounts of ent-kaurene (Figure 
6C).
Interestingly, the production of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane has been previously shown to 
critically depend on the identity of a specific residue, which is conserved as methionine in 
KSs, but is a smaller residue in diterpene synthases that produce 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane 
instead, with corresponding site-directed mutagenesis of this residue leading to substantial 
changes in product outcome (Kawaide et al., 2011; Zerbe et al., 2012; Irmisch et al., 2015). 
TwTPS16v2 contains an alanine at this position and, consistent with previous reports, 
substitution of Met leads to predominant production of ent-kaurene, with smaller amounts of 
16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, from ent-CPP by the resulting mutant TwTPS16v2:A608M 
(Figure S8). The result, together with a report identifying two key residues of TwTPS14 and 
TwTPS21 by Hansen et al. (2017b), highlights the evolutionary potential of this enzymatic 
family to drive rapid diversification of plant diterpene biosynthesis through neo-
functionalization (Hansen et al., 2017b).
Identification of a miltiradiene synthase
Given the data indicating a role for miltiradiene in triptolide biosynthesis, it was 
hypothesized that an alternative terpene synthase responsible for its formation must be 
expressed in the T. wilfordii suspension cell cultures. Hence, we screened the transcriptome 
dataset using the amino acid sequence of the known miltiradiene synthase from Salvia 
miltiorrhiza (SmMS; Gao et al., 2009), as the probe sequence (with a cutoff E-value of < e
−10). In total, 6 potential terpene synthases were found, including two of the already 
characterized diterpene synthases, two that fall within the TPS-a sub-family and appear to be 
sesquiterpene synthases, and two that fall within the TPS-b sub-family, which usually 
indicates that these would be monoterpene synthases (Table S6). However, consistent with a 
very recent report that appeared during the course of our studies (Hansen et al., 2017a), we 
also found that one of these, upon recombinant expression in E. coli and subsequent in vitro 
cell-free assays in combination with TwTPS7v2, produces miltiradiene (Figure 6D). Given

that this TPS appears to be allelic to the previously identified miltiradiene synthase, sharing 
98.0% identity, to be consistent with that previous report, this is named here TwTPS27v2.
Use of TwTPS7v2/TwTPS9v2 and TwTPS27v2 in metabolic engineering
Yeast has been engineered to produce miltiradiene using the relevant diterpene synthases 
from S. miltiorrhiza (SmCPS1 and SmMS), including the use of gene fusions between 
SmCPS1 and SmMS, which led to increased yield when expressed in the order SmMS-
SmCPS1 (Zhou et al., 2012). Here the utility of the relevant diterpene synthases from T. 
wilfordii for similar engineering was investigated. However, the yield from co-expression of 
TwTPS27v2 with either TwTPS7v2 or TwTPS9v2 in appropriately engineered yeast, which 
was equivalent to each other (Figure S9A), was not found to be significantly better than that 
previously reported using SmCPS1 and SmMS (Zhou et al., 2012). Moreover, fusing 
TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS27v2, in either orientation, actually significantly decreased the yield 
of miltiradiene, to less than 5% of the strain separately expressing each of these enzymes 
(Figure S9B). Indeed, unlike SmCPS1 and SmMS (Zhou et al., 2012), TwTPS7v2 and 
TwTPS27v2 do not seem to interact, consistent with negative results from yeast two-hybrid 
assays with these (Figure S10).
Subcellular localization
Particularly given that diterpene biosynthesis is initiated in plastids, separate from the 
cytosolic location presumed for monoterpene synthases (Chen et al., 2011), to verify the role 
of TwTPS27v2 and the other diterpene synthases, it seemed worth investigating their sub-
cellular localization. Accordingly, recombinant plasmids containing the ORFs of these genes 
fused with that for a green fluorescent protein (GFP) were transformed into N. benthamiana 
leaves, which were then examined for GFP localization (Figure 7). All GFP signals for 
TwTPS7v2, TwTPS3v2, TwTPS9v2 and TwTPS27v2 were mainly found in chloroplasts, 
while those for TwKSL1 and TwTPS16v2 were found both in chloroplast and cytoplasm, 
supporting roles for all of these in diterpene biosynthesis. However, consistent with the 
hypothesis that TwCPS2 is a non-functional pseudo-gene, the GFP signal for TwCPS2 
produced a typical cytoplasm localization pattern.
Induction of diterpene synthase transcription
To further investigate the potential role of the functionally characterized diterpene synthases 
in triptolide biosynthesis, their transcriptional response to MeJA was investigated. Transcript 
levels were measured by qRT-PCR in suspension cells after induction with MeJA. This 
revealed increased mRNA levels, peaking at 12 or 24 h, for all the diterpene synthases 
investigated here, except TwKSL1 (Figure 8).
RNAi of both TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS9v2, or TwTPS27v2
To provide more direct evidence of a role in triptolide biosynthesis for TwTPS7v2 and/or 
TwTPS9v2, as well as TwMS and, hence, miltiradiene, RNAi was employed with suspension 
cell cultures. Given the high identity between TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS9v2 (98.5%), both 
were targeted together using a stretch of identical sequence in the RNAi construct. While 
this only led to reductions of just over 30% in the transcript level of both TwTPS7v2 and

TwTPS9v2, transcript levels for TwCPS2 and TwTPS3v2 were not affected, and triptolide 
accumulation was nevertheless decreased by almost 50% compared to control cultures 
transformed with the empty vector. When RNAi targeting TwTPS27v2 was carried out, the 
transcript level of TwTPS27v2 was similarly only reduced by ~30%, with no reduction in 
the levels of the related TPS-b sub-family members TwTPS22v2, TwTPS23v2, TwTPS32, 
and TwTPS33, triptolide accumulation was decreased by ~40% (Figure 9).
DISCUSSION
The ability of T. wilfordii suspension cell cultures to produce valuable terpenoids, 
particularly the abeo-abietane tri-expoxide triptolide, has long been appreciated (Kutney et 
al., 1980). The suspension cell cultures used here constitutively produce 53 ± 3 µg/g of 
triptolide in the suspension cells and 4.0 ± 0.2 mg/L in the medium, which is slightly lower 
than that of recently reported Tripterygium adventitious root cultures (90 ± 80 µg/g in the 
adventitious roots and 4.7 ± 0.9 mg/L in the medium, Inabuy et al., 2017). Here the utility of 
these cell cultures for investigation of triptolide biosynthesis was first demonstrated by not 
only finding that miltiradiene can be detected therein, but also that feeding this olefin leads 
to increased accumulation, as well as the presence of several other plausible biosynthetic 
intermediates. Notably, it was further shown that triptolide biosynthesis can be induced by 
MeJA in these cultures, which further increases their utility by providing a means for co-
expression analysis.
To begin elucidating triptolide biosynthesis, an RNA-Seq approach was taken to generate an 
induced suspension cell culture transcriptome. The utility of this sequence data was 
demonstrated by identification of the diterpene synthases involved in production of 
miltiradiene and, hence, triptolide biosynthesis. These were found to consist of not only the 
expected class II diterpene cyclases that produce CPP, termed here TwTPS7v2 and 
TwTPS9v2, but also the unusual finding of a subsequently acting class I diterpene synthase, 
TwTPS27v2, which is not from the TPS-e sub-family that typically provides such enzymes 
in labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthesis (Zi et al., 2014), rather being derived from the 
phylogenetically distinct TPS-b sub-family instead. While similar biochemical 
characterization has been very recently reported for both presumably allelic copies of these 
T. wilfordii diterpene synthases (Hansen et al., 2017), as well as the orthologs from T regelii 
(Inabuy et al., 2017), the data reported here go beyond this to unambiguously demonstrate 
the role of the characterized enzymes in triptolide biosynthesis. Most critically, in addition to 
showing sub-cellular localization of these enzymes to the plastid, where such diterpene 
biosynthesis occurs in planta, this includes genetic evidence, with RNAi knock-down of 
these genes leading to reduced triptolide levels. Thus, it is now clear that TwTPS7v2, 
TwTPS9v2 and TwTPS27v2 are involved in triptolide biosynthesis, and these then provide 
targets for in planta metabolic engineering efforts aimed at increasing yields of this valuable 
diterpenoid natural product. In addition, the unambiguous assignment of miltiradiene as the 
olefin precursor now enables further investigation of subsequently acting enzymes, such as 
cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases, much as demonstrated in other (di)terpenoid 
biosynthetic networks (Kitaoka et al., 2015), and enabled by the induced transcriptome 
reported here.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plant material, chemicals and reagents
The T. wilfordii suspension cells were cultured in Murashige & Skoog basal medium 
containing 0.5 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 0.1 mg/L kinetin (KT), 0.5 
mg/L indole-3-butytric acid (IBA), and 30 g/L sucrose (pH = 5.8) by incubation in the dark 
at 25 °C on a rotary shaker (Su et al., 2014). After 10 days of cultivation, induced suspension 
cells were treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in carrier solution (dimethyl sulfoxide) at 
the final concentration of 50 µM, while control cultures were only treated with same volume 
of carrier solution. Nicotiana benthamiana were grown in a greenhouse with a 16 h-light/8 h-
dark cycle. Triptolide, wilforgine and wilforine were purchased from Chengdu Push Bio-
Technology Co., Ltd (Chengdu, China). Celastrol, demethylzeylasteral and triptonide were 
purchased from Chengdu Must Bio-Technology Co., Ltd (Chengdu, China). Triptophenolide 
and neotriptophenolide were purchased from Shanghai yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd 
(Shanghai, China). Dehydroabietic acid, triptinin B and triptoquinonide were purchased 
from BioBioPha Co., Ltd (Yunnan, China). All other reagents were purchased from Merck.
Metabolite analysis of suspension cell cultures and native plant
Solid samples were harvested and homogenized using Retsch MM400 mixer mill (Retsch 
GmbH, Haan, Germany), and placed in an ultralow-temperature refrigerator at 80 °C for at 
least 4 h prior to freeze drying for 48 h (EYELA FDU-1110, Tokyo, Japan). For each 
sample, aliquots of 50 mg were suspended in 1 mL of 80% (v/v) methanol overnight at room 
temperature, and then subjected to sonication in an ultrasonic water bath for 60 min. The 
supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane filter (polytetrafluoroethylene) before 
further analysis. A medium aliquot of suspension cell cultures (generally 7.5 mL) was 
extracted twice with ethyl acetate (3 mL each time) by thorough mixing for 1 min at room 
temperature. The organic fractions were pooled and dried using a Nitrogen Evaporator 
(Baojingkeji, Henan, China). The residue was redissolved in 300 µL of 80% methanol and 
passed through a 0.22-µm membrane filter prior to injection into the UPLC/Q-TOF MS 
system for analysis.
The UPLC separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC™ I-Class system 
(Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 analytical 
column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 µm) kept at 40 °C. The mobile phase, consisting of a 
mixture of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B), was pumped at a flow 
rate of 0.5 mL/min. The gradient elution was programed as follows: 0 min at 30% B, 6 min 
at 45% B, 18 min at 60% B, 23 min at 90% B. The TOF MS experiments were performed 
using a Xevo G2-S QTOF MS system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The experiment 
was performed in the ESI (+) ionization modes and the data acquisition modes were MSE 
continuum. The source and desolvation temperature were 100 °C and 450 °C, respectively, 
and the desolvation gas flow rate was 900 L/h. The capillary voltage were 0.5 KV and the 
cone voltage was 40 V. The ramp collision energy was set as 20–40 eV for the high-energy 
scans. The data acquisition range was 50–1500 Da. The mass accuracy was maintained 
using a lock spray with leucine enkephalin (200 pg/µL, 10 µL/min) as the reference (m/z

556.2771 ESI (+)). Data analysis was performed using the UNIFI Scientific Information 
System.
Feeding studies
Miltiradiene (13.6 mg) in 200 µL of methanol/DMSO (1/1, vol/vol) was fed to freshly sub-
cultured suspension cells cultures (~1 g fresh weight suspension cells in 10 mL MS media in 
50-mL flasks), and cells in control group were only treated with the same volume of carrier 
solution. After treatment, the cells were harvested in liquid nitrogen at 0, 1, 3 and 5 d, and 
the corresponding medium was stored at 4 °C. All the media (~ 10 mL) were extracted twice 
with ethyl acetate (5 mL each time) and the organic fractions were pooled dried in the 2.0-
mL eppendorf tube as described above. Solid samples were homogenized and freeze dried, ~ 
80 mg added to the 2.0-mL eppendorf tube, which were then extracted with 1.5 mL of 80% 
(v/v) as described above. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane filter 
(polytetrafluoroethylene) for UPLC analysis. Additional details are provided in the 
supplemental METHODS.
RNA-Seq
Total RNA of the MeJA-induction 12–24–48 h suspension cells was isolated using the 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Del Sal et al., 1989). The total RNA 
was treated with RNase-free DNase I (NEB, USA) and purified by RNA Purification Kit 
(Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). A total of 3 µg purified RNA was used as input material 
for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® 
Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s 
recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. 
Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. 
Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in 
NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5×). First strand cDNA was synthesized 
using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H−). Second 
strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. 
Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. 
After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop 
structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to preferentially select cDNA 
fragments of 150~200 bp length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP 
system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then 3 µl USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used 
with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37°C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C 
before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, 
Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. Finally, PCR products were purified (AMPure 
XP system), and library quality assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.
The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation 
System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina 
Hiseq 2000 platform and paired-end reads were generated. Over 95% of these reads 
(63,401,185) were judged to be clean, and used for further analysis. The left files (read1 
files) from all libraries/samples were pooled into one big left.fq file, and right files (read2

files) into one big right.fq file. Transcriptome assembly was accomplished based on the 
left.fq and right.fq using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) with min_kmer_cov set to 2 by 
default and all other parameters also set to their default values. Gene function was annotated 
based on the following databases: Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences), Nt (NCBI 
non-redundant nucleotide sequences), Pfam (Protein family), KOG/COG (Clusters of 
Orthologous Groups of proteins), Swiss-Prot (A manually annotated and reviewed protein 
sequence database), KO (KEGG Ortholog database), GO (Gene Ontology).
RACE and gene cloning
Purified RNA was used to synthesize the 3'- or 5'-RACE-ready cDNA with the SMARTer™ 
RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Cal., USA). To acquire the full-
length cDNA sequences, it was necessary to perform 3' and 5' RACE reactions, which were 
done following the user's manual and using gene specific primers based on the 
corresponding sequences from the T. wilfordii transcriptome sequencing dataset (Table S7). 
The full-length ORFs were cloned by PCR amplification using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA 
Polymerase (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturer's 
instructions, then ligated into the pMD19-T vector (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) 
and verified by complete sequencing.
Sequence analysis
The sequences of the cDNA for TwTPS7v2, TwCPS2, TwTPS3v2, TwTPS9v2, TwTPS27v2, 
TwKSL1, and TwTPS16v2 were analyzed at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The 
open reading frames (ORFs) and deduced amino acid sequences were determined using the 
online tool ORF Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) and the ExPASy 
online tool (http://web.expasy.org/translate/), respectively.
Although none of the T. wilfordii diterpene synthases identified here were exactly identical 
to those recently reported by others (Anderson-Ranberg et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2017a), 
most were similar enough to be allelic and were named accordingly. In particular, given the 
96.8%, 98.9%, 99.3%, 98.5%, and 98.0% identities (at the amino acid sequence level) to the 
previously characterized ent-CPP synthase TwTPS3, CPP synthases TwTPS7 and TwTPS9, 
16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane synthase TwTPS16, and miltiradiene synthase TwTPS27, the 
corresponding enzymes were named TwTPS3v2, TwTPS7v2, TwTPS9v2, TwTPS16v2, and 
TwTPS27v2, respectively. By contrast, TwKSL1 shares less than 95% identity with any of 
the previously characterized diterpene synthases.
For phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequences for a variety of diterpene synthases were 
obtained from the NCBI database (Table S8), and a tree constructed with the MEGA6 
software package (Tamura et al., 2013) using the neighbor-joining method. One thousand 
bootstrap replicates were performed in each analysis to define the level of confidence 
support.
Sub-cellular localization
All constructs for N. benthamiana transformation were prepared using the E3025 vector (Jin 
2008), which contains a gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the 35S

promoter, and the specific primers were listed in Table S7. The recombinant plasmids 
containing the ORFs of the targeted diterpene synthase(s) were first transformed into 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105, then injected to the N. benthamiana leaves, with 
subsequent observation via confocal laser scanning microscopy. Detailed information on 
subcellular localization analysis is given in the supplemental METHODS.
MeJA induction and UPLC analysis
After 10 days of cultivation, the suspension cells were treated with MeJA in carrier solution 
(dimethyl sulfoxide) at a final concentration of 50 µM, while cells in the control group were 
only treated with same volume of carrier solution. Post-induction cells were harvested in 
liquid nitrogen after 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 240 h. Three samples were prepared for 
each time point in each group for UPLC analysis. Additional details are provided in the 
supplemental METHODS.
qRT-PCR analysis
The suspension cells harvested for UPLC analysis were also used for real-time gene 
expression analysis, following the procedure previously described (Su et al., 2017). 
Expression levels were evaluated using the 2−ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) 
based on β-actin as the reference gene, with triplicate measurements from three biological 
replicates.
Recombinant expression
The relevant ORFs were amplified by PCR using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase and 
gene specific primers (Table S7), then ligated into pMD19-T followed by complete 
sequencing and sub-cloning into the N-terminal MBP fusion expression vector pMAL-c2X 
(NEB, USA). The ORF for AtKS was amplified from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library, 
and sub-cloned into the pMAL-c2X vector. S. miltiorrhiza SmCPS1 and SmMS ORFs were 
sub-cloned into the pET32a(+) vector.
The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli TransB (DE3) for heterologous 
expression, using the empty pMAL-c2X vector as a negative control. Cultures (200 mL) 
were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/L Tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L 
NaCl) containing 100 mg/L ampicillin until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm 
reached 0.6 to 0.8, then induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside 
(Sigma, USA) and grown at 16 °C for 8 h at 200 rpm. The cell pellets were harvested by 
centrifugation (3,000 g, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 5 mL of assay buffer (50 mM 
HEPES, pH 7.2, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) and 
lysed by a sonicator on ice. The lysates were centrifuged (12,000 g, 30 min, 4 °C) to produce 
soluble extracts, which were then concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit 
with Ultracel-30 membrane (Merck Millipore, Germany), according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.
In vitro cell-free assays
To determine the catalytic activity of the recombinant proteins, 200 µM GGPP (Sigma-
Aldrich) was added to 0.2 mL of recombinant cell-free extracts, incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in

the dark, and then extracted with hexane (3 × 0.5 mL). Residual organic solvent was 
removed under a stream of N2 before adding 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; 
NEB, USA), and then incubating for 4 h at 37 °C to allow enzymatic dephosphorylation. A 
standard for CPP was produced by incubation of SmCPS1 with GGPP for 2 h at 25 °C, with 
dephosphorylation by CIP as above. The dephosphorylated compounds were extracted with 
hexane (3 × 0.5 mL), with the organic extracts then completely dried under N2 and the 
residue dissolved in 60 µL of hexanes for GC-MS analysis (Zhang et al., 2015).
Coupled assays were performed to determine the stereochemistry of CPP much as 
previously described (Keeling et al., 2010). Briefly, assays containing each class II TwTPS 
and GGPP were pre-incubated for 2 h at 25 °C, at which point equivalent volumes of cell-
free extracts from individually expressed diterpene synthases (AtKS, SmMS, TwTPS27v2, 
TwKSL1 or TwTPS16v2) were added, along with MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM. 
These reactions were then incubated overnight at room temperature before extraction with 
hexane (3 × 0.5 mL), and subsequent GC-MS analysis. Production of 16α-hydroxy-ent-
kaurane was confirmed by comparison to an authentic sample isolated from gametophores of 
the moss P. patens (Hayashi et al., 2006).
Yeast expression
To confirm the results of the in vitro cell-free assays, the ORFs of single functional class II 
diterpene cyclases, as well as the functional enzymatic pairings, were PCR-amplified using 
gene-specific primers (Table S7), then sub-cloned into the yeast epitope-tagging vector 
pESC-Trp (Agilent Technologies, USA) via digestion by the corresponding restriction 
endonucleases. The resulting plasmids were transformed into the yeast BY-T20 strain 
(BY4742, ΔTrp1, Trp1::HIS3-PPGK1-BTS1/ERG20-TADH1-PTDH3-SaGGPS-TTPI1-PTEF1-
tHMG1-TCYC1), which produces the GGPP substrate (Dai et al., 2013, 2014; Shi et al., 
2014), and then enzymatic activity analyzed much as previously described (Su et al., 2016). 
Briefly, organic extracts were dried and the residues dissolved in 60 µL of hexanes for GC-
MS analysis as described above.
Analysis of TwKSL1 in E. coli
To identify the products of TwKSL1, this was transferred to pET44a, using the BamHI and 
XhoI restriction sites. This was used for expression in E. coli strain C41 OverExpress 
(Lucigen) also engineered to produce ent-CPP, using a previously described modular 
metabolic engineering system (Cyr et al., 2007). The resulting recombinant strain was grown 
in 50 mL of TB media, shaken at 200 rpm, first at 37 °C to OD600 ~ 0.8, then shifted to 
16 °C for 1 h before induction with 1 mM IPTG, following which the culture was further 
shaken at 16 °C for 3 d. The resulting TwKSL1 products were directly extracted with an 
equal volume of hexanes, which was then separated, dried under a gentle stream of N2, and 
the residue resuspended in 500 µL hexanes, with 1 µL then subjected to GC-MS analysis. 
Compounds were identified by comparison of retention time and mass spectra to previously 
characterized enzymatic products (Jia and Peters, 2016).

Yeast two-hybrid assays
To test the interactions of TwTPS27v2 and TwTPS7v2, as well as TwTPS27v2 and 
TwTPS9v2. TwTPS27v2 was fused with the BD domain in the pGBKT7 vector, and 
TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS9v2 were individually fused with the AD domain in the pGADT7 
vector. Primers used for the constructs are listed in Table S7. Yeast two-hybrid assays to 
assess protein interactions were performed using the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
AH109, as previously described (Zhai et al., 2015).
Engineering yeast for miltiradiene production
To examine the catalytic efficiency of TwTPS7v2 versus TwTPS9v2, these were both sub-
cloned into the vector pESC-Trp, and the resulting vector used for their co-expression in the 
yeast BY-T20 strain. The induced yeast cells (20 mL, cultivated for 48 h in SD-Trp-His 
liquid induction medium supplemented with 20 g/L D-galactose) were extracted and 
analyzed by GC-MS as described above.
To examine the ability of fusion to improve yield of miltiradiene, TwTPS7v2 was fused with 
TwTPS27v2. We constructed two modules producing the fused protein TwTPS27v2-
TwTPS7v2 and TwTPS7v2-TwTPS27v2 by inserting a widely used GGGS linker encoded 
by a “GGT GGT GGT TCT” sequence, according to the protocol of pEASY®-Uni Seamless 
Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The recombinant plasmids 
pESC-Trp::TwTPS7v2/TwTPS27v2, pESC-Trp::TwTPS7v2-TwTPS27v2 and pESC-
Trp::TwTPS27v2-TwTPS7v2 were transformed into BY-T20, induced with D-galactose. The 
products were then analyzed by GC-MS as described above. Linear calibration was 
performed to calculate the yield of miltiradiene (R2 = 0.9997).
Site-directed mutagenesis of TwCPS2 and TwTPS16v2
Site-directed mutagenesis of the DXDD motif of TwCPS2 (DTDC311TAM to 
DTDD311TAM), and the active site of TwTPS16v2 (DLLKSA608LRE to DLLKSM608LRE) 
were performed with the relevant pMAL-c2X construct using mutagenic primers (Table S7) 
and the Fast Mutagenesis System (TransGen Biotech), according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Expression and functional characterization of these mutants was carried out as 
described above.
RNAi
Vector pK7GWIWG2D (Invitrogen, USA) was used for RNAi targeting TwTPS7v2 and 
TwTPS9v2, or TwTPS27v2, in suspension cells. Briefly, fragments of TwTPS7v2/
TwTPS9v2 or TwTPS27v2 were ligated to vector pK7GWIWG2D using the Gateway 
cloning system (Invitrogen) and the resulting vectors transformed into suspension cells.
Suspension cells in the logarithmic growth phase were plated on MS solid medium 
supplemented with 0.5 mg/L 2,4-D, 0.1 mg/L KT, and 0.5 mg/L IBA, and 30 g/L sucrose 
(pH = 5.8), and grown for 7 days before bombardment. Then the recombinant plasmids were 
transformated into the cells using a biolistic gene gun (PDS 100/He, Bio-Rad). Each 
transformation was performed twice. The resulting recombinant cells were cultured for 7 
days before UPLC analysis.
