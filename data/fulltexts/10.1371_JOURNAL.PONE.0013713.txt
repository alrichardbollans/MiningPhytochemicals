Abstract
Background: In our investigations towards the isolation of potentially biologically active constituents from Orchidaceae, we
carried out phytochemical and biological analyses of Vanda species. A preliminary biological screening revealed that Vanda
coerulea (Griff. ex. Lindl) crude hydro-alcoholic stem extract displayed the best DPPH /
NOH radical scavenging activity and in
vitro inhibition of type 2 prostaglandin (PGE-2) release from UVB (60 mJ/cm
2) irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes.
Principal Findings: Bio-guided fractionation and phytochemical analysis led to the isolation of five stilbenoids: imbricatin (1)
methoxycoelonin (2) gigantol (3) flavidin (4) and coelonin (5). Stilbenoids (1–3) were the most concentrated in crude hydro-
alcoholic stem extract and were considered as Vanda coerulea stem biomarkers. Dihydro-phenanthropyran (1) and dihydro-
phenanthrene (2) displayed the best DPPH/
NOH radical scavenging activities as well as HaCaT intracellular antioxidant
properties (using DCFH-DA probe: IC50 8.8 mM and 9.4 mM, respectively) compared to bibenzyle (3) (IC50 20.6 mM). In turn,
the latter showed a constant inhibition of PGE-2 production, stronger than stilbenoids (1) and (2) (IC50 12.2 mM and 19.3 mM,
respectively). Western blot analysis revealed that stilbenoids (1–3) inhibited COX-2 expression at 23 mM. Interestingly,
stilbenoids (1) and (2) but not (3) were able to inhibit human recombinant COX-2 activity.
Conclusions: Major antioxidant stilbenoids (1–3) from Vanda coerulea stems displayed an inhibition of UVB-induced COX-2
expression. Imbricatin (1) and methoxycoelonin (2) were also able to inhibit COX-2 activity in a concentration-dependent
manner thereby reducing PGE-2 production from irradiated HaCaT cells. Our studies suggest that stilbenoids (1–3) could be
potentially used for skin protection against the damage caused by UVB exposure.

Introduction
Skin is continuously exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiations from
sunlight and to environmental pollution. UVB (290–320 nm)
radiations trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
increasing oxidative stress in irradiated skin. ROS are an inherent
part of the anabolism and catabolism of tissues, including skin.
Cellular enzymes and controlled metabolic processes ordinarily
keep oxidative damage to cells at a minimum. In times of
increased ROS production (caused by sunlight, smoke and
pollution) protective controls may not be adequate anymore
resulting in an oxidant-antioxidant imbalance, defined as oxidative
stress. It can cause many adverse effect (ageing) and pathological
conditions (inflammation, cancer) via the modulation of biochem-
ical, genetic and signal transduction pathways [1–3].
UVB radiations induce cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression
and subsequently increase the production of prostaglandin E2
(PGE-2) in keratinocytes. COX-2 is a rate limiting enzyme for the
generation of prostaglandin metabolites and its expression has
been linked to the pathophysiology of inflammation and cancer
[4]. PGE-2, the major prostaglandin synthesized by COX-2, is
produced abundantly by keratinocytes under UVs exposure,
especially in aged human skin [5]. This prostaglandin is known
to play an important role in skin inflammation as it is responsible
for erythema, edema and vascular permeability facilitating the
infiltration of neutrophils to the dermis [6]. It also increases
keratinocytes proliferation and differentiation and is consequently
involved in epidermal homeostasis and repair [7]. Finally, UVB
increase oxidative stress and the generated reactive oxygen
intermediate are most likely involved in the up-regulation of
COX-2 [7,8]. Consequently, both ROS and PGE-2 are critical
mediators of skin inflammation process. Inhibition of COX-2
enzyme is considered as an important mechanism for skin
photoprotection [9].
Plants have also to protect themselves from solar radiation.
Thus, they synthetize natural chromophores like polyphenolic
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13713compounds (flavonoids, stilbenoids and tannins) that are able to
absorb UV radiations and display antioxidant properties [10].
Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the use of
natural occuring plant products for the prevention of UV-induced
skin damages. Polyphenols possessing skin anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant properties are among the most promising group of
natural compounds that can be exploited as ideal photoprotective
agents [11]. Recently, polyphenols such as silymarine from milk
thistle, soy isoflavones including genistein, green tea catechins,
proanthocyanidins and resveratrol from grape seeds, have been
demonstrated to have potent photoprotective properties when
used topically on skin. These antioxidant polyphenols were all able
to reduce UVB-induced inflammatory responses, partly due to the
suppression of COX-2 expression and/or its enzymatic activity
[10–12].
The Orchidaceae is subdived in five subfamilies. Genera form
the Epidendroideae subfamily such as Dendrobium, Bletilla, Cymbid-
ium, Gastrodia and Vanda occurred mostly in tropical areas [13–14].
Flavones C-glycosides [15], hydroxybenzyle derivatives [16],
fluorenones and stilbenoids [17–20] are the most commun
polyphenolic compounds described for these orchids. Many
cosmetic patents protected the use of different orchid extracts
but without any information about the identity of their active
compounds. Orchidaceae from the genus Vanda have not been well
studied considering their biological activities on human cells and
their chemical composition. Only two kinds of phenanthropyran
have been described in the species V. parviflora [21] and V. tesselata
[22], which has been demonstrated to display wound healing
properties [23]. These observations led us to focus our interest to
Vanda coerulea Griff. ex Lindl, also known as the ‘‘Blue Orchid’’. A
preliminary biological screening on stem, root and leaf crude
hydro-alcoholic extracts revealed that V. coerulea stem extract
displayed best DPPH /OH radical scavenging activity and in vitro
inhibition of PGE-2 production from irradiated HaCaT (geneti-
cally modified keratinocytes). Bio-guided fractionation combined
with phytochemical analysis allowed us to isolate and identify five
stilbenoids (Figure 1): two 9,10 dihydro-phenanthropyrans
imbricatin (1), and flavidin (4), two 9,10 dihydro-phenanthrenes
methoxycoelonin (2) and coelonin (5) and one bibenzyle gigantol
(3). Additional compounds identified were carbohydrates and
terpenoids such as sesquiterpenes and phytosterols.
In the present work, we examine whether stilbenoids from Vanda
coerulea stems display radical scavenging activities, attenuate
intracellular ROS formation and reduce both UVB-induced
PGE-2 production on HaCaT cells and COX-2 activity.
Comparison of their radical scavenging properties led us to a first
structure-activity relation (SAR) study performed with orchid’s
stilbenoids. Biological analyses on HaCaT cells were performed
with the three most concentrated stilbenoids (1–3). We evaluated
here for the first time the potential interest of stilbenoids from
Orchidaceae as new skin photoprotecting agents.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13713deposited in the Herbarium of the Xishuangbanna Tropical
Botanical Garden (XTBG). Stems from flowering specimens were
collected in October 2006. Cut stems were dried by sunshine on
hanging basket to avoid contamination by soil and prevent fungus
development. After reception in France, dried cut stems were
finally reduced to powder in the ultra-centrifuge crusher (Retsch
ZM 200) just before extraction. Supply of stems was carried out in
accordance with CITES (Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of wild Fauna and Flora) regulations.
Extraction and isolation
Dried V. coerulea stems (100 g) were exhaustly extracted with
EtOH-H2O (9:1) under reflux and filtered to provide a red brown
crude hydro-alcoholic extract (8.9 g). Dried stems (100 g) were
also successively extracted by cyclohexane (C6H12), dichlorometh-
ane (CH2Cl2) and methanol (MeOH) using an automatisable
Soxtec (Avanti 2055), to yield C6H12 (1.0 g), CH2Cl2 (1.0 g), and
MeOH (5.8 g) extracts, respectively. An aliquot of CH2Cl2 extract
(0.64 g), which concentrated stilbenoids, was suspended in
MeOH-CH2Cl2 (8:2) and subjected to Sephadex LH20 column
(H: 27 cm d: 2.5 cm) with MeOH-CH2Cl2 (8:2) elution and
collection of 25 fractions of 10 mL. Fractions with similar TLC
(Thin Layer Chromatography) profiles were gathered. Fractions 3
to 6, rich in stilbenoids, were further purified by semi preparative
reversed-phase HPLC to give compounds 1 (70 mg), 2 (35 mg) 3
(19 mg), 4 (8 mg) and 5 (8 mg).
Extract and fractions were analyzed by RP-HPLC using a
Nucleodur C18ec column (5 mm, 250 mm64.6 mm i.d.) in a
Varian chromatograph equipped with a Prostar 230 pump and a
Prostar 330 diode-array detector. The column was eluted with
MeOH-(H2O+0.1% HCO2H) using a linear gradient at a flow
rate of 1 mL.min
21, starting from 20% up to 47% MeOH in
13.5 min, maintaining 47% MeOH during 10 min and finally
from 47% to 100% MeOH in 10 min. The fractions were
monitored between 200 and 400 nm. Semi-preparative HPLC
purifications of stilbenoids were carried out on another chromato-
graph equipped with a Gilson 322 pump and a UV-VIS 151
Gilson wavelength detector, using a Nucleodur C18ec column
(5 mm, 250 mm621 mm i.d.) eluted with MeOH-(H2O+0.1%
HCO2H) under the following conditions: 47% MeOH during
10 min and to 100% MeOH in 30 min at a flow rate of
15 mL.min
21. The fractions were monitored at 210 nm.
Structures of these stilbenoids were elucidated by spectral
analyses (
1H-NMR,
13C NMR, HMBC, HSQC, NOESY, and
HR-ESI-MS) and confirmed by comparison with those reported in
literature [24–29].

Cell lines
HaCaT Keratinocytes were provided by LVMH recherche.
Cells were cultivated in keratinocytes serum free medium (KSFM)
complemented with 0.25% human recombinant EGF (Epidermal
Growth Factor), 2.5% pituitary bovine extract, and 5% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). All biological analyses were realized at
passages 15 to 20.
In vitro antioxidant analyses
All in vitro radical-scavenging experiments (DPPH,
NOH/luminol
chemiluminescence) and IC50 calculations were assayed as
previously described by Parejo et al [30]. Results were expressed
as percentage inhibition of DPPH discolouration and luminol
chemiluminescence reduction, respectively. The concentration
effect (logarithmic curve) obtained for each compound was used to
calculate IC50. Serial dilutions of 1–5, and quercetin (used as
standard reference) were prepared in MeOH.
Analyses on HaCaT cells
For measurement of reactive oxygen species neutralization and
PGE-2 quantification with Vanda coerulea stem biomarkers, HaCaT
cells were seeded in black 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio One
655090) at a concentration of 10
3 cells/well in complemented
KSFM with 5% FBS. Microplates were incubated during 24 h
Antioxidant Stilbenoids & COX2

2 and
treatment. For western blot analysis HaCaT cells were seeded at a
density of 10
6 cells/ 100 mm dishes and incubated during 48 h
before irradiation with UVB at 60 mJ/cm
2 (UV Lamp, VL-6LM,
Vilber Lourmat) and treatment. All experiments were performed
at 90% cell confluency. Cell viability was previously evaluated
thanks to XTT analysis according to Roehm NW et al [31]. Serial
dilutions of 1–3, were prepared in DMSO (0.1% v/v final
concentration). The first higher concentration tested was not
cytotoxic (data not shown).
Reactive oxygen species neutralization on HaCaT
The DCFH-DA method was used to detect the levels of
intracellular ROS [32] DCFH-DA diffuses into cells, where it is
hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to polar 29,79-dichlorodihy-
drofluorescein. This non-fluorescent fluorescein analog is oxidized
by intracellular oxidants to a highly fluorescent, 29,79-dichloro-
fluorescein. Tocopherol [Sigma] (25 mM) was used as a positive
reference. HaCaT cells were seeded as described and treated with
serial dilutions of 1–3 and quercetin (standard reference) after
24 h incubation. Treated microplates were further incubated
during 24 h (37uC, 5% CO2). HaCaT cells were washed with
phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and DCFH-DA (0.05 mM) was
added to the cells. 45 min after incubation, cells were stimulated
by a H2O2 solution (100 mM in PBS) to generate an oxidative
stress. Immediately after F(T0) and 40 min after stimulation
F(T40), DCFH fluorescence was detected at an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm,
using a SpectraFluor Plus spectrofluorometer (Tecan). Two kinds
of assay controls were used: negative control was non-stimulated
cells and positive control was H2O2 stressed cells (DMSO 0.1% v/
v). Results were expressed in percentage of fluorescence inhibition
(% of ROS neutralization) calculated by comparison with H2O2
stimulated cells.
(% of ROS neutralization) = [1- [F(T40)-F(T0)] sample/
[F(T40)-F(T0)] positive control] 6100.
Inhibition percentages were plotted according to compounds 1–
3 and quercetin concentrations. Logarithmic regression analysis of
the mean replicate values was used to calculate IC50 (Concentra-
tion causing half-maximal neutralization of ROS on H2O2 stressed
HaCaT)
Measurement of irradiated HaCaT PGE-2 production
Indomethacin (2.79 mM), a non-steroidal COX inhibitor, was
used as a positive reference. Treated microplates were incubated
at 37uC, 5% CO2. Untreated irradiated and non irradiated cells
(DMSO 0.1% v/v final) were respectively used as positive and
negative controls. After 24 h, supernatants were harvested for
PGE-2 concentration measurement and BCA assay was realized to
determine total cellular protein in each well. PGE-2 concentration
was measured using the enzyme immunoassay Parameter
TM PGE-
2 kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Each PGE-2 quantification (QPGE-2) was reported to total protein
concentration per well.
Results were expressed as inhibition percentage of PGE-2 (I
PGE-2) production compared with untreated irradiated cells
(positive control).
I PGE-2=100- ((QPGE2) sample/( Q PGE2) positive control) 6100.
Inhibition percentages were plotted according to compounds
1–3 concentrations. Logarithmic regression analysis of the mean
replicate values was used to calculate IC50 (Concentration
causing half-maximal Inhibition of irradiated HaCaT PGE-2
production)
Measurement of COX-2 enzyme expression by Western
blot
After UVB irradiation 100 mm dishes were treated with
stilbenoids 1–3 at 23 mM and 2.87 mM in a serum free medium
and incubated during 16 h (37uC, 5% CO2). Untreated irradiated
(UVB+) and non irradiated (UVB-) cells were used as positive and
negative controls respectively. Total cell lysates were obtained using
lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and
proteases inhibitors. The protein concentration of each sample
was determined using a Bradford assay. 30 mg of total protein was
separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Positive control CCD-
1064SK cell lysate containing both b-actin and COX-2 was also
loaded. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
Tris-buffered-saline (TBS), the membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies anti-COX-2 and anti-b-actin at a concentration
of 1:1000 in a 1% BSA TBS-T solution (containing 0.05% Tween
20) overnight at 4uC. Blot were washed twice with TBS-T and then
incubated with a 1:20000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots
were again washed three times with TBS and then developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. The assay was repeated
three times with similar results. Densitometry analyses were
performed for each blot on the radiographic films using the ImageJ
software. Results were expressed as fold decrease compared to the
(UVB+) control. Each data was then reported to b-actin density.
Measurement of COX-2 enzyme activity
Serial dilutions of 1–3 were prepared in DMSO. Six
concentrations were tested from 0.1 mM to 100 mM for imbricatin
(1), from 0.03 to 100 mM for methoxycoelonin (2) and from
0.3 mM to 100 mM for gigantol (3).

were pre-incubated for 20 min at 22uC with the human
recombinant COX-2 enzyme (0.2 mg) in buffer containing
100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM phenol and 1 mM hematine.
Thereafter, the reaction was initiated by addition of 2 mM
arachidonic acid and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at
22uC. For basal control measurements, arachidonic acid was
omitted from the medium. Indomethacin was used as positive
inhibitory reference.
Following incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition
of 1 M HCl then 1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) followed by cooling to
4uC. The amount of PGE-2 present in the reaction mixture was
quantified using an EIA detection kit (Cayman Chemical).
The results were expressed as inhibition percentage of the
control enzyme activity:
100–[(activity measured in the presence of the compound/
control enzyme activity) 6100]
The IC50 values (concentration causing a half-maximal
inhibition of control enzyme activity) and Hill coefficients (nH)
were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the inhibition
curves generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation
curve fitting.
Statistical Analysis
In vitro experiments were performed three times independently.
All data were expressed as means 6 standard deviations (sd).
Treatment groups were compared by using one way analysis of
variance ANOVA post-hoc test. Each stilbenoid effect was
compared to positive control using student t tests. Statistical
significance (*) was set at p,0.05.

Results and Discussion
Bio-guided fractionation performed on Vanda coerulea stems
revealed that a stilbenoid-enriched CH2Cl2 extract displayed a
better in vitro DPPH/
NOH radical scavenging activity and
inhibition of PGE-2 release from (UVB 60 mJ/cm
2) irradiated
HaCaT than crude hydro-alcoholic extract. These observations
led us to the isolation and identification of the five stilbenoids
described in Figure 1. These stilbenoids are specific from the
Orchidaceae family and were already described in other orchid
genera [19,20]. Imbricatin (1) was first identified in the orchid
Pholidota imbricata [24]. It was found together with flavidin (4)i n
Bulbophyllum [19], Coelogyne and Pholidota species [24–26] and was
also isolated with methoxycoelonin (2)i nAgrostophyllum callosum and
in Coelogyne flaccida [26]. Coelonin (5) was isolated from two species
of Coelogyne: C. ochracea and C. elata [27]. Finally, the presence of
gigantol (3) was identified for the first time in Cymbidium giganteum
[28], and was also found together with coelonin (5) and
methoxycoelonin (2)i nCymbidium aloifolium [29].
A comparison of phytochemical profiles of root, stem and leaf
crude extracts showed that stilbenoids 1–5 were only present in
Vanda coerulea stems. The most concentrated (1–3) were considered
as V. coerulea stem biomarkers.
Antioxidant activities
Each stilbenoid isolated from Vanda coerulea stems was already
described for its radical scavenging properties mostly concerning
DPPH neutralization [33–35]. Zhang X et al had evaluated radical
scavenging properties of gigantol (3) using the DPPH (IC50
56.4 mM) and ORAC assays [33]. Wang J et al and Guo XY et al
indicated that coelonin (5) and imbricatin (1) neutralized DPPH
radical with IC50 of 16.7 and 8.8 mM, respectively [34,35]. Finally,
the global antioxidant activities of flavidin (4) were evaluated using
different antioxidant assays, including DPPH and hydrogen
peroxide neutralization (without IC50 calculation) [36]. However,
the radical scavenging capacities of stilbenoids 1 to 5 were not
compared so far. Here, we aimed to propose a structure-activity
relationship (SAR) relative to DPPH and
NOH radical scavenging
activities.
Among all the ROS produced,
NOH radicals are among the
most aggressive forms implied in cellular oxidative stress [1–2].
Our results revealed that dihydro-phenanthropyrans (1, 4) and
dihydro-phenanthrenes (2, 5) displayed better
NOH but also DPPH
radicals scavenging properties than bibenzyle (3). Activities of
imbricatin (1) and methoxycoelonin (2) were quite similar to the
standard quercetin on
NOH radical scavenging activities, while
flavidin (4) and coelonin (5) were globally less active. (Figure 2,
Table 1).
SAR on
NOH radical scavenging indicated that dihydro-
phenanthropyran and dihydro-phenanthrene structures had quite
the same potentiality, which was enhanced by an ortho-methoxy-
hydroxyl substitution on aromatic ring. According to these results,
a classification could be proposed as followed (from the lowest to
the highest IC50): 1<2.4<5.3 for
NOH radical scavenging
activities.
We also observed a tendency for dihydro-phenanthropyran
structures to better neutralize DPPH radical. Scavenging activities
were better on structures without ortho-methoxy-hydroxyl substi-
tution. Thus, a classification could be proposed as followed:
4 .1<5$2.3 for DPPH radical scavenging capacities.
In comparison with already published data, the IC50 of
imbricatin (1) calculated for DPPH scavenging activities was in
accordance with those indicated in literature [35].On the other
side, better IC50 values were obtained with gigantol (3) and
coelonin (5) than those previously described by Zhang X et al and
Wang J et al , respectively [33,34].
The 9,10 dihydro-phenanthrenes (2, 5) or phenanthropyrans (1,
4) are planar structures compared with the bibenzyle gigantol (3).
Thus, electron delocalization and structure stabilization is better
on phenanthrenes than on bibenzyle. As explained by Jayapraka-
sha GK et al, the antioxidant capacities of 9,10 dihydro-
phenanthrenes or phenanthropyrans may be attributed to
hydrogen donating ability, the product phenoxyl radical being
stabilized by resonance delocalization of the unpaired electron to
the other position in the ring [36].
The excessive production of intracellular ROS plays an
important role in the signalling events leading to gene activation
[1–3]. Oxidative stress generated is responsible for a variety of
conditions including skin ageing [2,3], skin inflammation and
cancer [1,4]. Based on these premises, we examined whether the
major stilbenoids (1–3), considered as Vanda coerulea stem
biomarkers, could neutralize intracellular ROS in H2O2 stressed
HaCaT cells.
The probe 29,79-dichlorofluorescin is used as an indicator of
ROS formation in H2O2 (100 mM) stressed HaCaT. The
intracellular fluorescence measurement using this probe mainly
reflects the ability of stilbenoids to inhibit intracellular
NOH radical
[37]. In this assay, we have compared the ROS scavenging
activities of stem biomarkers. According to our previous cell
viability analyses, the first higher concentration tested on HaCaT
cells was not cytotoxic. Imbricatin (1) (IC50 8.8 mM) and
methoxycoelonin (2) (IC50 9.4 mM) showed better ROS neutral-
ization than gigantol (3) (IC50 20.6 mM) and even than quercetin
(IC50 13.8 mM). (Figure 3, Table 2) These results were in
accordance with our results obtained previously on
NOH radicals,
with chemiluminescence. Consequently, we have demonstrated
the intracellular ROS scavenging activities of these three
stilbenoids on immortalized keratinocytes. Best intracellular
antioxidant activities were obtained with the dihydro-phenan-
thropyran (1) and the dihydro-phenanthrene (2).
Intracellular ROS produced in excess contribute to inflamma-
tory response triggered by UV radiations and have been suggested
to be involved in UVB-induced COX-2 expression [1,8]. In this
study, we observed that stilbenoids (1–3) reduce the generation of
intracellular ROS partly due to direct radical scavenging activities.
Inhibition of PGE-2 production
PGE-2 is known to play an important role in UV-induced skin
inflammation. Its production is mediated by UVs and ROS
induction of COX-2 expression. Moreover, it has been reported
that keratinocytes proliferation and apoptosis are also regulated by
COX-2 after acute UV radiations [9].
Anti-inflammatory properties for gigantol (3) and coelonin (5)
only, were already described in the scientific literature and
referred mostly to the neutralization of nitric oxide production
(and PGE-2 production for gigantol) on murine macrophages
RAW 264.7 [38–40]. However, the skin anti-inflammatory
properties of orchid stilbenoids have not been evaluated so far on
HaCaT, a recognized cellular model [41,42]. Therefore, we
wanted to evaluate the potential of V. coerulea antioxidant stem
biomarkers as skin anti-inflammatory agents. Their effects were
evaluated on PGE-2 production and on inhibition of COX-2
expression in UVB irradiated HaCaT cells. As shown in Table 3
and Figure 4, the stilbenoids (1–3) inhibited PGE-2 release
Antioxidant Stilbenoids & COX2

2) irradiated HaCaT cells. To compare
biomarker activities the same range of concentrations was
tested for each stilbenoid. Concentration-dependent effect was
observed for imbricatin (1)( I C 50 12.2 mM) and methoxycoelonin
(2)( I C 50 19.3 mM), but not for gigantol (3). The results
revealed that even at the lowest concentration tested, gigantol
(3) strongly inhibited PGE-2 production. We deduced from these
data that these three major stilbenoids were principally
responsible for the antioxidant and the reduction of PGE-2
production previously observed with V. coerulea crude stem
extract. Bibenzyle gigantol (3) displayed better PGE-2 inhibition
than dihydro-phenanthropyran (1) and dihydro-phenanthrene
(2), but without any concentration-dependant effect at the tested
concentrations.
This global reduction of PGE-2 production could be attributed
to an inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity and/or an attenuation
of UVB-induced COX-2 expression.
Interestingly, (Figure 5, Table 3) imbricatin (1) and
methoxycoelonin (2) but not gigantol (3) were able to inhibit
human recombinant COX-2 enzyme (IC50 12.0 mM and 5.8 mM,
respectively), suggesting that dihydro-phenanthropyran (1) and
dihydro-phenanthrene (2) but not bibenzyle (3) could reduce PGE-
2 production through COX-2 inhibition. Their effect on human
recombinant COX-2 enzyme was comparable to the activity of
indomethacin (IC50 1.6 mM), a classical non-steroidal COX
inhibitor.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13713The IC50 calculated for inhibition of PGE-2 production on
HaCaT are different from those calculated for COX-2 inhibition.
Indeed, for the first analysis we have measured stilbenoid activities
on the whole cell, determining a global response leading to the
release of PGE-2. For the second analysis, we have directly
determined stilbenoids effects on human recombinant and isolated
COX-2 enzyme. Because of these differences between cellular and
enzymatic analysis the IC50 calculated in both experiments were
not identical.
Wong J.H. et al 2006 have demonstrated that gigantol (3) was
able to inhibit PGE-2 production on murine macrophages RAW
264.7 as a result of inhibition of COX-2 expression but also of NF-
kB expression [38]. We hypothesized that the constant inhibition
effect of (3) on HaCaT PGE-2 production could be explained by a
strong reduction of UVB-induced COX-2 enzyme expression.
Western blot analysis was performed with UVB (60 mJ/cm

stilbenoids were tested (23 and 2.87 mM) on HaCaT. As shown
in Figure 6, the three biomarkers were able to attenuate UVB-
induced COX-2 expression at 23 mM. Best results were obtained
with methoxycoelonin (2) and gigantol (3). They did not inhibit
COX-2 expression at the lowest concentration tested (2.87 mM).
Gigantol demonstrated strong inhibition of PGE-2 production
even at 2.87 mM but did not inhibit COX-2 expression and

through other mechanisms to exert its inhibitory effect on PGE-2
production and COX-2 enzyme may not be its only biological
target.
UVB exposure induces ROS accumulation in human skin and is
involved in its ageing process as well as its inflammatory response
[1–3]. This accumulation would explain a higher induction of
COX-2 and consequently a higher PGE-2 release [5]. Irradiated
HaCaT cells provide a good model to measure PGE-2 production
and allowed the evaluation of the potential keratinocytes anti-
inflammatory properties of the major stilbenoids isolated from V.
coerulea stems. Our results revealed that the dihydro-phenanthrene
methoxycoelonin (2) and the dihydro-phenanthropyran imbricatin
(1) displayed the best intracellular antioxidant activities on HaCaT
keratinocytes and interesting anti-inflammatory properties due to a
concentration-dependant inhibition of COX-2 activity and
expression. The bibenzyle gigantol (3) better inhibited HaCaT
PGE-2 production compared to methoxycoelonin (2) and
imbricatin (1) at each concentration tested. Its activity could be
partly attributed to an attenuation of UVB-induced COX-2
expression. No concentration-dependent inhibitory effect was
observed to allow IC50 calculation for gigantol (3) effect on PGE-2
production. Wong JH et al also demonstrated that this compound
(3) was able to reduce NF-kB expression on murine macrophages
RAW 264.7 [38]. Thus, this transcriptor factor could be another
target, leading to a reduction of PGE-2 synthesis and to a global
anti-inflammatory effect on irradiated HaCaT. Interestingly, our
results revealed that gigantol (3) displayed a 16-fold stronger
inhibition of PGE-2 production on human HaCaT than on
murine macrophage RAW 264.7 [38].
In summary, major stilbenoids (1–3), considered as Vanda
coerulea stem biomarkers, provided chromophore structures
absorbing UVB radiations. Applied locally these polyphenolic
compounds may act as a sunscreen [11]. Our data hitherto obtained
showed that imbricatin (1), methoxycoelonin (2) and gigantol (3)
displayed antioxidant properties on HaCaT by means of
intracellular ROS neutralization. The three stilbenoids were able
to reduce UVB-induced COX-2 expression, thereby reducing
PGE-2 production on HaCaT keratinocytes. These activities could
be partly linked to the reduction of intracellular oxidative stress, to
a reduction of COX-2 expression and, for imbricatin (1) and
methoxycoelonin (2) to a direct inhibition of COX-2 enzyme
activity. Globally, we observed complementary properties between
the dihydro-phenanthropyran imbricatin (1) the dihydro-phenan-
threne methoxycoelonin (2) and the bibenzyle gigantol (3). The
first displayed better antioxidant activities whereas the latter
showed strong inhibition of PGE-2 production. Anti-inflammatory
property of orchid’s stilbenoids was here described for the first
time on HaCaT keratinocytes. Vanda coerulea stem biomarkers
could be considered as potential new natural skin photoprotecting
agents.
