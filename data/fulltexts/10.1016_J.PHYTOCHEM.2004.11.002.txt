Abstract 
 
Ten new sesquiterpenes, many of them representing novel carbon skeletons, were 
identified in foliage of Cupressus macrocarpa. These are (—)-10-epi--acoradiene; ent-
widdra-2,4(14)-diene; (E)-iso-8-bisabolene i.e. (4E)-4-(1,5-dimethylhex-5-enylidene)-1-
methylcyclohexene; (—)-cumacrene i.e. (4S)-4-[(1R,2S)-2-isopropenyl-1-
methylcyclobutyl]-1-methylcyclohexene; (—)-<-chamipinene i.e. (1S,6S,7S)-2,2,6,8-
tetramethyltricyclo[5.3.1.01,6]undec-8-ene; and five sesquiterpenes with a 3,3,4'-
trimethyl-1,1'-bi(cyclohexyl) skeleton for which the trivial name macrocarpane is 
proposed. The possible single-enzyme biogenesis of these sesquiterpenes is discussed.

Introduction 
 
Cupressus macrocarpa Hartw. ex Gord. (Monterey cypress) is a narrow endemic native 
only on Point Lobos and Cypress Point, Monterey Co., California.  It is a large and 
picturesque tree, and despite its limited natural range it is one of the best-known and 
most widely planted conifers in the state. 
 
Within Cupressus, Monterey cypress has been considered most closely related to four 
other coastal Californian cypress taxa with non-glandular foliage:  C. abramsiana C. B. 
Wolf, C. goveniana ssp. goveniana  Gord., C. goveniana ssp. pygmaea (Lemm.) Bartel, 
and C. sargentii Jeps., although Wolf (1948) saw it as morphologically somewhat 
distant from the others.  The distinction of C. macrocarpa within this north-coastal 
group of cypresses was supported by analysis of their foliar monoterpene composition 
(Zavarin et al., 1971). 
 
All of the north-coastal Cupressus species produce an essential oil that is low in 
sesquiterpenoids (Zavarin et al., 1971).  Briggs and Sutherland (1942) analyzed C. 
macrocarpa foliar oil by fractional distillation and reported only ca. 0.7% for the 
sesquiterpene fraction of the oil.  Our examination of 40 C. macrocarpa specimens (20 
planted and 20 from the Point Lobos population) by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) confirmed that sesquiterpenes are generally a minor component 
of the volatile oil. However, some individuals produced oil with up to 9% 
sesquiterpenoids, which included a number of apparently novel hydrocarbons.  The

identity of ten of these sesquiterpenes is the subject of this report. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
A number of sesquiterpenoids were ubiquitous in Cupressus macrocarpa foliage, 
though in widely varying amounts:  <-cubebene, @-funebrene, caryophyllene, 
germacrenes A and B, cedrol, <-bisabolol, nerolidol, and farnesol were detected by GC-
MS in nearly all trees.  There was also a distinct chemophenotype, represented in three 
of the 40 trees, which produced sizable amounts of germacrene C (detected as the Cope 
rearrangement product -elemene), (+)-guaia-6,9-diene 1, and an unknown that is 
tentatively identified as (1R,4S,5R)-guaia-6,10(15)-diene 2 (see Experimental).  The 
chirality of 1 was determined from its retention time on enantioselective GC (EGC 
hereinafter), which was different from that of authentic (—)-guaia-6,9-diene.  (+)-
Guaia-6,10(15)-diene has been reported from the coral Nephthea chabrolii (Rao et al., 
2000), though the absolute stereochemistry was not determined.  The absolute 
stereochemistry of putative 2 from C. macrocarpa is assumed to be the same as 1.
A second, and more common, C. macrocarpa chemotype (29 of 40 trees) was typified 
by presence of over 25 unknown sesquiterpenes, ten of which were in sufficiently high 
concentration for isolation and characterization.  Known compounds (—)-@-
sesquiphellandrene, K-cuprenene, acora-3,7- and -4,7-diene (Kaiser and Naegeli, 1972; 
Marx and Norman, 1975), (—)-dauca-8,11-diene (Cool, 2001), and the rare (—)-
cuparene and (—)--cuprenene, were also detected in small amounts during isolation of

the major sesquiterpenes in the oil. 
 
Compounds 3-7 proved to be irregular sesquiterpenes with a 3,3,4'-trimethyl-1,1'-
(bicyclohexyl) skeleton, for which the trivial name macrocarpane is proposed. Greek 
letters and ar-, E- and Z- prefixes indicate the various double-bond and geometric 
macrocarpene isomers (see Experimental). These sesquiterpenes are remarkable in 
having only three terminal carbons, the fourth having presumably been incorporated 
during biogenesis of the dimethylcyclohexane ring. 
 
The structures of <- and @-macrocarpene (3 and 4), which were the major sesquiterpenes 
in this chemotype, were deduced from the 1D NMR data (see Experimental).  The 1H

and 13C spectra of both included seven signals almost identical to those of the 
corresponding non-isopropenyl atoms of limonene, while other 1H signals of 3 and 4
closely matched data for the ring protons of 1,3,3- and 1,5,5-trimethylcyclohexene, 
respectively (Snowdon et al., 1987).  HMQC experiments permitted assignment of all 
1H and 13C signals, and an HMBC experiment on 4 confirmed the macrocarpane carbon 
skeleton (correlations in Table 1). 
 
Both 3 and 4 are levorotatory, and based on studies on the optical rotation of 4-
substituted 1-methylcyclohexenes (Mills, 1952), their absolute stereochemistry can be 
assumed to be that of (—)-limonene, i.e. 1S.
The structures of non-chiral double bond isomers (Z)- and (E)-8-macrocarpene (5 and 6
respectively), which occur in ca. 1:5 ratio in the oil, were inferred from their 1H, 13C,  
1H-1H NOESY, and (for 5) HMBC NMR data (see Table 1).  The spectra of 5 and 6
were very similar and absence of a chiral center in these compounds was evident from 
magnetic equivalence of the 1H or 13C signals from both atoms of each geminal pair.  
NMR data of terpinolene (1H and 13C) and 3,3-dimethylmethylenecyclohexane (1H; 
Bernard et al., 1974) had the pertinent methyl and ring signals very close to those of 5
and 6. The macrocarpane carbon skeleton of the predominant E isomer 6 was 
confirmed by hydrogenation, which yielded the same two isomeric Mr = 208 compounds 
as were obtained from hydrogenation of 4. The geometry of the tetrasubstituted double 
bond was determined by NOESY experiments, in which the decisive cross-peaks were

It should be noted that 5 and 6 were very unstable when purified, being oxidized and 
isomerised within minutes unless preserved with an antioxidant. 
 
Minor component ar-macrocarpene 7 (Mr = 202) had 1H NMR signals (see 
Experimental) that indicated its basic structural features:  a bicyclic sesquiterpene 
consisting of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (4H, K 7.06) with a methyl group (3H, K
2.18) and attached to a saturated cycloalkyl ring bearing a geminal methyl pair (two 
singlets, K 0.91 and 0.93, 3H each).  The macrocarpane structure suggested by these 
features was confirmed by GC comparison of the hydrogenation products of 7 with 
those of 4 and 6. All three starting materials produced the same two isomeric 
macrocarpanes, though in different ratios (see Experimental).  Since 7 is chiral and was 
found to be dextrorotatory (D = +7.2°), its enantiomeric purity was investigated by 
EGC.  Neither 7 itself nor its hydrogenation products showed evidence of separable 
enantiomers.  However, EGC analysis of the hydrogenation product mix from 6, which 
must contain both enantiomers of each diastereomer, also showed no separation of the 
enantiomeric pairs.  Thus there is no assurance that 7 is optically pure. However, the 
fact that it is not racemic suggests that its biosynthesis involves a stereospecific enzyme-
mediated hydride shift from C-1 to C-7 before aromatization. The absolute 
stereochemistry shown is based on the fact that 3,3-dimethylcyclohexanes with achiral 
1R substituents are reported to be dextrorotatory (Ansari, 1973).

The structure of cyclobutanoid sesquiterpene 8, which is given the trivial name 
cumacrene, was determined by a series of 2D NMR experiments (data in Table 2).  1H-
1H TOCSY defined the coupled proton system H-8 T H-9 T H-10, and HMQC 
gave the proton-carbon assignments.  HMBC gave 2- and 3-bond heteronuclear 
correlations that were only consistent with a cyclobutane ring substituted as shown.  The 
trans relative stereochemistry at C-7 and C-8 was clear from a strong NOESY peak 
between H-8 and H-15. The attachment of the 4-methylcyclohexene ring at C-1 was 
required by the TOCSY and HMBC data. 
 
The C-1/C-7 relative stereochemistry was investigated by comparing results of 
NOESY experiments (Table 2) with minimum-energy (MM2 force field) conformation 
calculations for 8 and its C-1 diastereomer.  The calculations for 8 found two low-
energy conformations differing by just 0.18 kcal-mol–1, while for the C-1 epimer the 
steric energy difference between the two lowest-energy conformations was 1 kcal-mol–1.
Potentially informative close contacts for 8 would be from quasi-equatorial H-6 to H-
13 in one conformation or to H-15 in the other, while for the C-1 epimer neither of these 
interactions would be expected.  The NOESY experiment in CDCl3 was not definitive 
due to overlap of key signals, but in C6D6, where the broad H-6 multiplet as well 
resolved, there was a cross-peak indicating an H-13/H-6 correlation. Furthermore, 
cross-peaks from H-15 to H-6 and -6 appeared which suggested the participation of 
both conformations of 8 in the observed NOEs.

The depicted absolute stereochemistry of 8 is based on the assumption that the 
compound derives from the same (S)-bisabolyl precursor as congeners 3 and 4 (see 
discussion below). 
 
A sesquiterpenoid carboxylic acid with the 1-(2-isopropyl-1-methyl-cyclobutyl)-4-
methylcyclohexane ("dunniane") carbon skeleton has been described from Illicium 
dunnianum (Sy and Brown, 1998).  Besides the C-14 carboxyl functionality, this 
compound differs from 8 in having cis relative stereochemistry at C-7 and -8.  Thus the 
cumacrane and dunniane carbon skeletons bear the same stereochemical relationship as 
the cyclobutane monoterpenoids grandisol 9 and fragranol 10, respectively.  In fact, co-
occurrence of 8 with the macrocarpenes in C. macrocarpa suggests a biosynthetic 
parallel between sesquiterpene 8 and monoterpenoid 9, in that the latter also occurs 
naturally with corresponding monoterpenoid dimethylcyclohexane congeners, e.g. 2-
(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)ethanol (Tumlinson et al., 1971). 
 
Compound 11, another minor component (~0.5% of total sesquiterpenes), had a MS 
quite similar to that of thujopsene.  1D NMR of the purified compound showed that it is 
a tricyclic sesquiterpene with four methyls (one of them vinyl) on quaternary carbons.  
Unlike thujopsene, there were no high-field signals indicative of a cyclopropane ring.  
The NMR data (in C6D6, see Experimental) were very similar to the literature values (in 
CDCl3) for one candidate structure, 2,2,6,8-tetramethyltricyclo[5.3.1.01,6]undec-8-ene 
(Naegeli and Wetli, 1981).  A 1H NMR experiment with the C. macrocarpa unknown in

CDCl3 gave spectral data identical to the literature values, confirming its identification. 
 
The compound reported by Naegeli and Wetli (1981) was a by-product in a synthesis of 
the 1,1,5,9-tetramethylspiro[5.5]undecane (chamigrane) skeleton.  The authors note that 
acid-catalyzed scission of the C-1/C-10 bond of 11 leads directly to the chamigrenes. 
This relationship and the presence of a pinene substructure prompt the proposal of <-
chamipinene as the trivial name for 11. None of the related compounds found by 
Naegeli and Wetli (which by analogy would be called @-chamipinene, chamicamphene, 
and <-chamifenchene) was detected in C. macrocarpa.
Naegeli and Wetli (1981) synthesized racemic mixtures in their work, so there was no 
information on the optical rotation of the enantiomers of these compounds.  But since 
the absolute stereochemistry of <- and @-chamigrene is known, it seemed possible to 
determine that of 11 (D —4.3°) by acid-catalyzed rearrangement followed by 
enantioselective analysis of any chamigrenes produced.  When this was done, 11
completely rearranged to two major products that were identical to (—)-<- and  (—)-@-
chamigrene when analyzed by GC-MS and dual-column GC-FID, but differed in 
retention time from the (—) enantiomers on EGC.  Although (+)- and (—)--
chamigrene were only slightly separated, the -chamigrene enantiomers were resolved 
to the baseline, showing that the enantiomeric purity of the (+)--chamigrene, and 
therefore of 11 itself, is very high.

Acoradiene 12 is the C-10 epimer of (+)--acoradiene. Its GC retention time was 
slightly longer than that of -acoradiene, while its mass spectrum was very similar, the 
only significant difference being the somewhat larger ratio of ion m/z 108 to 107.  The 
structure and absolute stereochemistry of 12 were elucidated by a combination of 2D 
NMR, molecular mechanics (MM2) calculation, hydrogenation experiments, and EGC. 
 
1H-1H COSY and 1H-13C HSQC experiments indicated the acoradiene structure and 
allowed assignment of the 1H and 13C signals (Table 2).  Position of the endocyclic 
double bond at C-31 was inferred from the  39 ppm 13C signal for C-2, which is 
significantly different from that of the corresponding allylic carbon of <- and @-
acoradiene ( ~31 ppm).  This downfield chemical shift can be explained by absence of 
a  substituent interaction between Me-15 and C-2. Examination of the MM2 minimum-
energy conformations of all four diastereomers of acora-3,11- and -4,11-diene shows 
that in three of them H-15 is within 2.45 Å of the nearest allylic proton (H-2 or -6).  
Only in 12 is this distance large enough (ca. 4.7 Å) to preclude the upfield shift typical 
for this allylic carbon. 
 
GC-MS, dual-column GC-FID, and EGC comparison of the hydrogenation products of 
12 and authentic (—)--acoradiene 13 gave final proof of the relative and absolute  
stereochemistry at C-7 and C-10.  Hydrogenation of 13 gave two major saturated (Mr =

208) compounds 14a/b, along with small amounts of isopropyl epimers 14c/d.
Compound 12 gave nearly equal amounts of ent-14c/d and ent-14a/b. The assumption 
that ent-14a/b were artefacts due to acid-catalysed isomerization at C-7 was tested by 
repeating the hydrogenation of 12 with addition of a small amount of pyridine.  Though 
hydrogenation was less complete (there were now sizable amounts of monounsaturated 
Mr = 206 compounds), the amount of ent-14a/b was greatly reduced compared to ent-
14c/d (see Experimental).  An unexpected finding in this experiment was that although 
no unreacted 12 remained, a large peak corresponding to ent--acoradiene [acora-
4,7(11)-diene] was seen. 
 
A search through our in-house library of plant terpenoid GC-MS analyses showed that 
the mass spectrum of a sesquiterpene from the liverwort Pellia epiphylla (L.) Corda, 
collected in Humboldt Co., CA, very closely matched that of 12. GC-MS, dual-column 
GC-FID, and EGC comparisons under identical conditions showed that the P. epiphylla 
component, present at a concentration of ca. 2% in the oil, had MS and retention data 
exactly the same as that of 12 from C. macrocarpa. Thus the former is probably also  
(—)-10-epi--acoradiene. 
 
A compound with the same structure as 12 (or its enantiomer) has been reported as an 
aggregation pheromone in the flour beetle Gnatocerus cornutus (Tebayashi et al., 1998). 
 However, the published NMR and MS data are clearly different from those of 12.
Since no conformational analysis was done, the authors’ interpretation of the NOESY

data for the beetle pheromone may be open to question.  Of the four acora-3,11- and -
4,11-diene diastereomers, only 12 and -acoradiene are consistent with the reported 
NOESY cross-peak from H-15 to non-allylic H-6 or -2 .  But since the -acoradiene 
NMR data referred to in the paper was from a low-resolution experiment run in CCl4
rather than CDCl3, the possibility that the unknown (reported <D = +37.1°) might 
actually be the enantiomer of (—)--acoradiene 13 was missed. 
 
To check this, a high-resolution (400 MHz) 1H NMR spectrum was run on authentic 13
in CDCl3. The resulting signals were identical to those reported by Tebayashi et al. 
(1998), with two exceptions:  vinyl H-5 is at  5.30, not 5.60 as reported; and vinyl Me-
14 is at  1.63, not 1.67. Both of these discrepancies are doubtless due to typographical 
errors:  the depicted COSY spectrum clearly shows Me-14 at  1.63, and the authors 
characterize the 1H signals of the Gnatocerus cornutus acoradiene as “similar to those in 
the literature” for - and -acoradiene, both of which have the vinyl methyl at  5.25
(CCl4 data).  Thus the identity of the G. cornutus aggregation pheromone is revised to 
(+)--acoradiene. 
 
A small amount of compound 15, with a widdrane carbon skeleton, was isolated and 
identified by 1D and 2D NMR experiments (Table 3).  The essential features of the 
molecule were suggested by the 1D spectrum:  a bicyclic sesquiterpene with three 
methyl singlets and a disubstituted double bond flanked by (a) methine proton H-1

( 1.75, doublet) at a bridgehead carbon; and (b) exo-methylene-bearing quaternary 
carbon C-4.  A TOCSY experiment confirmed three correlated proton systems: the 
allylic protons at C-5 were coupled to H-6<,@; three methylenes at C-8, -9, and -10 
formed a second coupled system; and vinyl H-2 ( 5.55, dd) was coupled to H-3 ( 6.30,
d) and H-1.  Since H-1 was coupled only to H-2, the other two carbon atoms adjacent to 
C-1 must be quaternary.  HMQC accounted for 12 protonated carbons, so the three 
methyl singlets were obviously attached to these two quaternary carbons as a geminal 
pair and an angular methyl at the other bridgehead.  The widdrane skeleton suggested by 
these data was confirmed by an HMBC experiment, which showed key correlations 
from H-12 and -13 to C-1, -10, and -11; H-6 to C-15; and H-15 to C-1, -6/7, and -8.  A 
cis ring fusion was evident from a 1H-1H NOESY experiment, which gave a clear cross-
peak from H-15 to H-1.  The absolute stereochemistry was determined by EGC 
comparison of the two epimeric saturated hydrogenation products of 15 with those 
derived from authentic (+)-widdrol (7S absolute stereochemistry).  Generation of 
reference (7S)-widdranes required a somewhat roundabout procedure, since dehydration 
of widdrol leads to the methyl migration product pseudowiddrene rather than 
widdradienes (Ito et al., 1974).  (+)-Widdrol was first hydrogenated to dihydrowiddrol, 
which was found to be the desired cis–fused stereoisomer (see Experimental).  This was 
then dehydrated to two monoenes, which mixture was in turn hydrogenated to produce 
the cis-widdrane epimers.  These had retention times identical to those from 15 on dual-
column capillary GC but different on EGC, which established the 7R absolute 
stereochemistry of 15.

1D NMR of compound 16 showed it to be an achiral monocyclic sesquiterpene with 
three double bonds – one tetrasubstituted, one trisubstituted, and one disubstituted 
terminal methylene – and three vinyl methyl singlets.  HMQC and HMBC experiments 
(Table 3) allowed all signals to be unambiguously assigned, proving the iso-8-
bisabolene structure.  The 1E geometry was determined by a 1H-1H NOESY experiment, 
which showed a cross peak from H-15 to bis-allylic H-6.  Though it is a new natural 
product, this compound has been synthesized in a 60:40 mixture with the 1Z isomer, 
and the reported NMR data (in CDCl3) and MS data are very close to that found for 16
(Braun et al., 2003). 
 
Production of very complex mixtures of constitutive sesquiterpenes by a single enzyme 
catalyst has been demonstrated in Abies grandis stem tissue (Steele et al, 1998).  It is 
proposed that biosynthesis of the novel sesquiterpenes in C. macrocarpa foliage 
likewise involves a single “macrocarpene synthase” and can be rationalized as in 
Scheme 1.  The first step (not shown) is cyclase-catalyzed isomerization of (E,E)-
farnesyl diphosphate to (3S)-nerolidyl diphosphate (NPP) in the preferred anti-endo 
conformation (Cane, 1985, 1999).  Ionization and C-1, C-61 closure then generates an 
(S)-bisabolyl carbocation that is the proposed precursor of all product sesquiterpenes. 
 
Macrocarpenes 3-7 can be considered to arise via path (a), the first step of which is 
 
1 NPP numbering is used throughout this discussion.

Scheme 1.  Proposed mechanism for biosynthesis of novel C. macrocarpa sesquiterpenes via an (S)-
bisabolyl carbocation. 
 
deprotonation of the bisabolyl carbocation to (S)--bisabolene.  This neutral 
intermediate is not released from the enzyme active site but is immediately reprotonated 
at C-10 with ring closure from the C-7 methylene to C-11.  (A similar mechanism has 
been adduced by Erman (1985) in the biogenesis of the dimethylcyclohexylidene 
monoterpenoid pheromones in Anthonomus grandis.) Deprotonation of the resulting 
macrocarpene carbocation at C-6, C-8, or at the newly incorporated methylene (C-12 in

macrocarpene numbering) gives 3-6, while a C-6, C-7 hydride shift followed by 
aromatization accounts for ar-macrocarpene 7.
Path (b), involving C-7, C-10 cyclization of the original (S)-bisabolyl carbocation with 
proton loss from C-12, leads to 8. Alternatively, path (c), C-7, C-11 cyclization with a 
well-attested C-6, C-10 hydride shift (Cane, 1981, and references therein; Nabeta et al., 
1993), generates an ent-cuparenyl carbocation.  Deprotonation of this cation accounts 
for the rare (7S)-cuparenes observed, while C-7, C-11 bond scission with deprotonation 
at C-12 [path (c1)] is a plausible mechanism leading to bisabolene 16, with its unusual 
C-12 unsaturation. 
 
An alternative reaction of the ent-cuparenyl carbocation is C-7, C-6 skeletal 
rearrangement (c2), which generates an ent-chamigrenyl carbocation.  This opens the 
way to 11 via path (c3), C-2, C-7 closure with C-4 deprotonation; and to 15 by path 
(c4), C-6, C-7 skeletal rearrangement and a C-1, C-6 hydride and double bond shift, 
with deprotonation at the C-3 methyl. 
 
Finally, biosynthesis of acoradiene 12 [route (d)] requires a 1,2 hydride shift from C-6 
to C-7 of the bisabolyl carbocation (Nabeta et al., 1990) followed by C-6, C10 
cyclization and proton loss from C-12.

Experimental 
 
General experimental procedures 
Survey analyses of C. macrocarpa trees were done by grinding ca. 2 g of LN2–frozen 
foliage from each tree, extracting overnight with n-pentane, and analyzing the extracts 
by GC-MS (SE-54 WCOT column) and dual-column GC-FID (SE-54 and OV-17 
WCOT columns) under these conditions:  splitless (0.7 min) injection, injector 220 °C, 
FID detector 250 °C, column(s) 35 °C (0.7 min), 6 °C-min—1 program to 250 °C.  The 
same GC conditions were used for retention time determinations of purified 
sesquiterpenes. 
 
Hydrodistillation of bulk samples of LN2-ground foliage was from satd NaCl with 
NaHCO3 as previously described (Kim et al., 1994). 
 
LC of hydrodistilled oil (silica gel; hexane-EtOAc eluents) and FTIR of purified 
compounds were described before (Kim et al., 1994), as was EGC on a 10% permethyl-
-cyclodextrin column (Cool, 2001).   
 
Plant material 
Small survey samples of foliage were taken from 20 widely-separated trees in the Point 
Lobos population of Cupressus macrocarpa in March 1996.  Planted specimens (20

trees) were similarly sampled from the University of California Richmond Field Station 
in July 2001, and the horticultural tree with the highest yield of macrocarpenes was used 
for compound isolation.  
 
Sesquiterpene isolation and identification 
The n-pentane extract (ca. 2 ml) of foliage from a tree containing germacrene C and the 
guaiadienes was concentrated 10-fold under N2. This was applied to a column of silica 
gel in a Pasteur pipette and the hydrocarbon fraction eluted with 2 column volumes of n-
hexane.  (+)-Guaia-6,9-diene 1 was identified by GC-MS, dual-column GC-FID, and 
EGC comparison of the hydrocarbon fraction with authentic (—)-guaia-6,9-diene from 
commercial rose geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) oil.  The MS of the standard and 
the C. macrocarpa component were identical, as were the GC retention times under all 
conditions except on EGC. 
 
Guaia-6,10(15)-diene 2 was tentatively identified by the similarity of its MS with that of 
the compound from Nephthea chabrolii (K. Venkateswarlu, personal communication).

For isolation of the remaining sesquiterpenes, ca. 4000 g of LN2-ground foliage from the 
chosen horticultural tree was hydrodistilled in 800 g batches, yielding ca. 20 g oil.  
Additional oil was obtained by 9× batchwise hexane extraction of –20 mesh ground air-

dried foliage (1700 g), extract solvent removal, and subsequent hydrodistillation of the 
dark green residue (89 g) with 400 ml satd NaCl and 10 g NaHCO3, yielding another 20 
g of oil.  The combined oils (40 g) consisted of ca. 86% monoterpenoids, 9% 
sesquiterpenoids, and 5% diterpenoids. Before silica gel LC, most of the monoterpenes 
were removed by evaporation under N2 flow at ca. 120 °C, giving 13 g of monoterpene-
depleted oil. 
 
The first LC fraction, eluted with n-hexane, consisted solely of hydrocarbons.  This 
fraction (8 g) was separated by repeated complexation LC of 1.5 g portions on 50 g of 
20% AgNO3/silica gel using hexane-toluene step gradients, giving 11 fractions.  Minor 
fractions 1-3, 8 and 10 (each < 0.1 g, complex mixtures of trace compounds) and major 
fraction 5 (1.6 g, mostly 3), were not further analyzed.  Part of major fraction 6 (3 g), 
consisting mainly of 3 and 4, was subjected to prep. GC (see below) to give analytical 
samples (ca. 20 mg each) of 3 and 4. Fraction 4 (0.6 g), consisting of ca. 100:3:1:1 3,
11, 7 and 15 was re-chromatographed with 1% toluene/hexane to give a sub-fraction 
(ca. 0.1 g) enriched in 7, 11 and 15. In the case of 5-8, 11, 12 and 15, further separation 
was by isocratic HPLC (hexane-toluene eluents; RI detection) of portions of fractions 
rich in these compounds on a 10 × 250 mm column packed with 15% AgNO3/silica gel 
(5 µ), using the following toluene concentrations: 1.8% for fraction 4 sub-fraction (7, 11
and 15), 3.5% for fraction 7 (1.3 g) (5 and 6), 7% for fraction 9 (0.2 g) (8 and 12).  Final 
purification of all except 16 was by prep. GC on 4 mm i.d. packed columns (OV-17

rearrangement and oxidation.  Therefore, they were collected in capped 3 mm OD glass 
U-tubes which were treated with a solution of 100 µg each of antioxidant (Ionox 330, 
Ethyl Corp.) and pyridine-d5 in 5 µl of pentane, applied in the condensation zone of the

with n-hexane eluent partially resolved them, yielding >97% pure samples of 16 (12

Hydrogenation experiments on 4, 6, and 7 were done under 70 atm H2 with ca. 2 mg 
sesquiterpene and catalytic amounts of PtO2 in 200 µl hexane.  The same two Mr = 208

Acid-catalyzed rearrangement of (—)--chamipinene– 3 mg 11 and 1 mg 
Cu(OAc)2•H2O were dissolved in 100 µl of HOAc in a 1 ml vial, which was briefly 
flushed with argon then capped.  After 18 hr in a 110° oven, the vial was cooled and the 
contents diluted 20× with water and shaken 3× with 1 ml pentane.  The combined 
pentane extracts were washed with dil. aq NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, and analyzed by 
GC (2 columns), GC-MS, and EGC.  Major products were (+)--chamigrene (44%) and 
(+)--chamigrene (38%), identical by GC and GC-MS (but differing in r.t. on EGC) 
with (—)-- and (—)--chamigrene produced by acid-catalyzed rearrangement of 
authentic (—)-thujopsene under the same conditions (Daeniker et al., 1972).

similarly hydrogenated, yielding 2 fully saturated epimers in ca. 1:1 ratio.  Retention 
times of the widdrol-derived widdranes were identical with those from 15 on
conventional dual-column GC but longer on EGC.
