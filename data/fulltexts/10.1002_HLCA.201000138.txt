Three new eudesmanolactones (¼eudesmanolides), loloanolide A (1), loloanolide B (2), and 1-O-
acetylloloanolide B (3), together with five known compounds, were isolated from the CHCl3 extract of
the aerial parts of Camchaya loloana. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic
analysis. This type of eudesmanolactones bearing a 2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyloxy group at C(8) was
discovered for the first time. Compounds 1 – 3 exhibited cytotoxicity against the HepG2 cell line, with
GI50 values of 22.9, 18.1, and 12.8 nmol/ml, respectively.
Introduction. – The large family Asteraceae contains 25000 to 30000 species
belonging to ca. 1000 genera. Many species have been used as sources for medicines,
edible oils, vegetables, pesticides, etc. [1]. The extensive chemical and biological
investigations showed that this family is a rich source of sesquiterpenoids, especially
sesquiterpene lactones [2 – 4]. Many compounds from this family possess biological
activities including antitumor [5], cytotoxic [6], antimicrobial [7], and anti-inflamma-
tory effects [8]. The genus Camchaya with four species is distributed in the Indo-China
Peninsula. C. loloana Kerr is the only Chinese representative of this genus [9].
Previous studies of C. calcarea have resulted in the isolation of antiplasmodial and
antimycobacterial germacrolide sesquiterpenes [10]. However, there has been no other
report on chemical compositions of C. loloana subsequently. The present study reports
the presence of eudesmanolactones (¼eudesmanolides) in C. loloana, a rare kind of
constituent in the genus Camchaya. On the basis of spectral data, the new compounds
were determined to be (3b,6a,8a)-3-(acetyloxy)-8-{[2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyl]
oxy}eudesma-1,11(13)-dieno-12,6-lactone1) (¼ loloanolide A; 1), (1b,6a,8a)-1-hy-
droxy-8-{[2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyl]oxy}eudesma-2,4(14),11(13)-trieno-12,6-lactone1)
(¼ loloanolide B; 2), and (1b,6a,8a)-1-acetyloxy)-8-{[2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyl]oxy}-
eudesma-2,4(14),11(13)-trieno-12,6-lactone1) (¼1-O-acetylloloanolide B; 3) (Fig. 1).
The known compounds were characterized as b-sitosterol, b-daucosterol [11], lupenol,
betulin [12], and caffeic acid [13]. To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1 – 3 are
the first examples of eudesmanolactones with a 2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyloxy group at
C(8).

Results and Discussion. – Loloanolide A (1) was obtained as a colorless gum. The
HR-ESI-MS of 1 showed the quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 413.1569 ([MþNa]þ),
corresponding to the molecular formula C21H26O7 with nine degrees of unsaturation.
The IR spectrum of 1 exhibited absorption bands assigned to OH (3514 cm1), a,b-
unsaturated ester (1731 cm1), and g-lactone C¼O groups (1747 cm1). The 1H- and
13C-NMR spectra (Table) showed signals typical of an eudesmanolactone-like skeleton
[4]. The 13C-NMR spectrum revealed the presence of 21 C-atoms, which were
determined as three Me, two sp3 CH2 (one O-bearing at d(C) 62.0), six sp3 CH (three
O-bearing at d(C) 70.7, 77.7, and 71.5), and three C¼O groups (d(C) 170.7, 169.8, and
165.0), besides three C¼C bonds and a quaternary C-atom (Table), attributed on the
basis of chemical shifts, DEPT, and HSQC spectra. The 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 showed
one Me s (d(H) 1.06), one Me d (d(H)1.16 (d, J¼ 6.3 Hz)), two terminal olefinic H-
atoms (d(H) 5.80 and 6.32 (each d, J¼ 2.0 Hz)), and two olefinic H-atoms (d(H) 5.66
and 5.69 (each d, J¼ 9.6 Hz)). The HSQC and HMBC spectra led to the identification
of two partial structures: CH(5)CH(6)CH(7)CH(8)CH2(9)C(10)Me(15) and
CH(7)C(11)CH2(13) (Fig. 2). Moreover, the Me(14)CH(4)CH(5)C(10)
CH(1)CH(2)CH(3)CH(4) structure was readily deduced by HMBC cross-peaks.
Connection of these fragments established the framework of an eudesmano-
lactone. The 1H-NMR signals at d(H) 5.88 (br. s, 1 H), 6.22 (br. s, 1 H), and 4.29 (s,
2 H), as well as the 13C-NMR signals at d(C) 165.0 (C(1’)), 139.0 (C(2’)), 126.6 (C(3’)),
and 62.0 (C(4’)), were undoubtedly assigned to a 2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyloxy
moiety, which was located at C(8) in view of the HMBC HC(8)/C(1’). In addition,
1H-NMR signals at d(H) 2.03 (s, 3 H) and the 13C-NMR signals at d(C) 170.7 (C(1’’))
were attributed to an AcO group which was attached to C(3) in view of the HMBC
HC(3)/C(1’’). The lactone ring should be formed between C(6) and C(12) as
suggested by the HMBC HC(6)/C(12). The relative configurations of the various
groups were assigned on the basis of NOESYexperiments (Fig. 3) and 1H,1H-coupling-
constant analysis. In the NOESY plot, Me(15) correlated with HC(4) (d(H) 2.08 –
2.11), HC(6) (d(H) 4.59), and HC(8) (d(H) 5.44) suggesting that Me(15),
HC(4), HC(6), and HC(8) were oriented to the same b side. The NOESY
correlation of the HC(7) signal (d(H) 3.54 – 3.56) with HC(5) (d(H) 2.10) and the
coupling constant J(7,8)¼ 8.4 Hz) indicated that HC(7) and HC(5) were a-oriented.
HC(3) was also a-oriented based on the NOESY correlation HC(3)/HC(5).

Therefore, loloanolide A (1) could be characterized as (3b,6a,8a)-3-(acetyloxy)-8-{[2-
(hydroxymethyl)acryloyl]oxy}eudesma-1,11(13)-dieno-12,6-lactone1).
Loloanolide B (2) was isolated as a colorless gum. Its molecular formula C19H22O6
was deduced from the quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 369.1298 ([MþNa]þ) in the
HR-ESI-MS. The IR spectrum showed maxima at 3433 cm1 (OH), 1760 cm1 (g-
lactone), 1715 cm1 (a,b-unsaturated ester), 1633 cm1 (C¼C bond), and 1160 cm1
(~nCO of ester). Interpretation of the 1H- and 13C-NMR (DEPT) and HSQC revealed
that compound 2 possessed one Me, two sp3 CH2 (an O-bearing at d(C) 62.3), five sp3
CH (three O-bearing at d(C) 71.8, 76.7, and 70.7), and two C¼O groups (d(C) 169.6
and 165.2), besides four C¼C bonds (Table). Careful study of the NMR spectra
suggested that compound 2 was also an eudesmanolactone containing a 2-(hydroxy-
methyl)acryloyloxy group at C(8). Compared to 1, one Me and one Ac group were
absent, and one more C¼C bond was present in 2. The presence of conjugated C¼C
bonds (d(H) 5.82 (dd, J¼ 9.3, 5.5 Hz, 1 H), 6.25 (d, J¼ 9.3 Hz, 1 H), 5.44 (br. s, 1 H),
and 5.23 (br. s, 1 H)) was confirmed by the HMBCs CH2(14)/C(3) and C(4), and
HC(3)/C(2) and C(4) (Fig. 2). In addition, the HMBCs Me(15)/C(1) and HC(2)/
C(1) established the presence of a b-OH group at C(1), which was confirmed by the key
NOESY correlation HC(1)/HC(5). The relative configurations of other groups were
also assigned on the basis of NOESY experiments (Fig. 3). Thus, the structure of
loloanolide B (2) was determined as (1b,6a,8a)-1-hydroxy-8-{[2-(hydroxymethyl)-
acryloyl]oxy}eudesma-2,4(14),11(13)-trieno-12,6-lactone1).
Compound 3 was a colorless gum. The molecular formula C21H24O7 was established
from the quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 411.1427 ([MþNa]þ) in the HR-ESI-MS.
The UV, IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR data were very similar to those of 2, except for the
presence of one more Ac group (d(H) 1.98 (s, Me(2’’)); d(C) 20.9 (C(2’’)) and 170.3
(C(1’’))). The 1b-AcO group was deduced from the HMBC HC(1) (d(H) 4.76 (d, J¼
5.5 Hz))/C(1’’) and the NOESY correlation HC(5)/HC(1). The remaining structure
and relative configuration of 3were the same as those of 2. Thus, the structure of 3was
elucidated as (1b,6a,8a)-1-(acetyloxy)-8-{[2-(hydroxymethyl)acryloyl]oxy}eudesma-
2,4(14),11(13)-trieno-12,6-lactone1) (¼1-O-acetylloloanolide B).
Compounds 1, 2, and 3 showed cytotoxicity against the HepG2 cell line, with GI50
values of 22.9, 18.1, and 12.8 nmol/ml, respectively.

Plant Material. The aerial parts of Camchaya loloana were collected from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan
Province, China, in September 1998. The plant sample was identified by Prof. Jingyun Cui at
Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). A voucher
specimen (Z-005) was deposited with the Herbarium of the Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS.
Extraction and Isolation. The 95%EtOH extract (80 g) of air-dried aerial parts ofC. loloana (2.1 kg)
was suspended in H2O and extracted successively with petroleum ether, CHCl3, and BuOH. The CHCl3
fraction (18 g) was separated by CC (SiO2 (600 g; 150 mm 330 mm), petroleum ether/acetone 5 :1, 4 :1,
3 :1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2 (each 3000 ml)): Fractions A –D. The separation of Fr. A (2.5 g) by CC (SiO2 (80 g;
40 mm 250 mm), petroleum ether/AcOEt 10 :1) afforded b-sitosterol (0.8 g) and lupeol (0.4 g).
Betulin (0.2 g) and caffeic acid (0.72 g) were obtained, resp., by crystallizing Fr. B from petroleum ether/
acetone 1 :1 and Fr. C from acetone. The residue of the mother liquid (1.1 g) of the betulin crystallization
was applied to CC (SiO2 (50 g; 30 mm 200 mm), CHCl3/acetone 4 :1): 1 (14 mg). Separation of the
residue of the mother liquid (65 mg) of caffeic acid by semi-prep. HPLC (MeOH/H2O 55 :45) yielded 2
(7 mg) and 3 (15 mg). Fr. D (4.0 g) was subjected to CC (SiO2 (150 g; 50 mm 30 mm), CHCl3/MeOH
5 :1): b-daucosterol (2.7 g).

Cytotoxicity Assays. Hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to the suppliers instruction. The cells were seeded into 96-
well plates, incubated for 16 h at 378, and treated with compounds 1, 2, and 3 at different concentrations
for 48 h. Taxol was used as pos. control. The cytotoxic activity was examined by means of a colorimetric
chemosentivity assay with SRB (sulforodhamine B). The GI50 value (the drug concentration required to
inhibit the cell growth by 50%) was used as a parameter for cytotoxicity.
