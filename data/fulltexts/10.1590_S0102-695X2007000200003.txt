The reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the methanol extracts afforded two bioactive dibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignans, matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2). The structures of these lignans were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses as well as by the direct comparison of experimental data with respective literature data. Keywords: Centaurea urvillei subs. armata, Centaurea mucronifera, Asteraceae, Compositae, lignan, arctiin, matairesinoside, DPPH, MTT, brine shrimp lethality assay.INTRODUCTION Centaurea urvillei subs. armata Wagenitz and C. mucronifera DC. (Family: Asteraceae alt. Compositae), are two Turkish endemic perennials that are distributed in the Mediterranean, the Middle and the Eastern Anatolian regions of Turkey (Wagenitz, 1975). To our knowledge, no reports on the isolation of any plant secondary metabolites or any pharmacological properties of these plants are available to date. However, many species of the genus Centaurea have long been used in traditional medicine to cure various ailments, e.g. diabetes, diarrhoea, rheumatism, malaria, hypertension, treatment of drug dependence etc., and a variety of secondary metabolites have been reported from different species of this genus (Sarker et al., 1997; Carlini et al., 2006). As a part of our continuing phytochemical and bioactivity studies on the species of the genus Centaurea (Shoeb et al., 2006a,b; 2005; 2004a,b; Sarker et al., 2005; 2001; 1998; 1997), we now report on the assessment of the extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera for antioxidant activity, general toxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively, by the DPPH assay, the brine shrimp lethality and the MTT cytotoxicity assays, and the isolation and identifi cation of two major bioactive lignans, matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2), from these plants. MATERIAL AND METHODSGeneral156Mohammad Shoeb, Stephen M. MacManus, Marcel Jaspars, Paul Kong-Thoo-Lin, Lutfun Nahar, Sezgin Celik, Satyajit D. SarkerRev. Bras. Farmacogn.Braz J. Pharmacogn.17(2): Abr./Jun. 2007UV spectra were obtained in MeOH using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-vis spectrometer. MS analyses were performed on a Quattro II triple quadrupole instrument. NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD on a Varian Unity INOVA 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer 400 (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C) using the residual solvent peaks as internal standard. HPLC separation was performed using a Dionex prep-HPLC system coupled with Gynkotek GINA50 autosampler and Dionex UVD340S Photo-Diode-Array detector and/or A JASCO PU-1580 Intelligent HPLC Pump, coupled with JASCO DG-1580-53 Degasser and JASCO LG-1580-02 Ternary Gradient Unit. A Luna C18 preparative (10 μM, 250 mm × 21.2 mm) and/or a Luna C18 semi-preparative HPLC column (5 μM, 250 mm x 10 mm) were used. Sep-Pak Vac 35 cc (10 g) C18 cartridge (Waters) was used for pre-HPLC fractions. HMBC spectra were optimised for a long range JH-C of 9Hz and the NOESY experiment was carried out with a mixing time of 0.8s.Plant materialThe aerial parts of Centaurea urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera were collected from Anatolia, Turkey. Voucher specimens PHSH80012 and PHSH0013, respectively, for C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera have been retained in the herbarium of the Plant and Soil Science Department, University of Aberdeen, Scotland (ABD).Extraction, isolation and structure elucidation Dried ground aerial parts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera (100 g) were separately, Soxhlet-extracted, successively, with n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol (MeOH) (1 L each). The MeOH extract (2.0 g) of C. urvillei was fractionated by solid-phase extraction method using a Sep-Pak C18 (10 g) cartridge eluting with a step gradient: 40, 60, 80 and 100% MeOH in water (200 mL each). Prep-HPLC (eluted with a linear gradient- water:MeOH = 75:25 to 30:70 over 50 min followed by 70% MeOH for 10 min, 20 mL/min) of the Sep-Pak fraction, which was eluted with 40% MeOH, yielded compounds 1 (12.4 mg, tR = 20.6 min) and 2 (56.0 mg, tR = 24.5 min). The ‘dereplication’ of the Sep-Pak fractions of the MeOH extract (100 mg) of C. mucronifera using the HPLC-PDA analyses revealed the presence of exactly the same lignans (1 and 2) in the Sep-Pak fraction, which was eluted with 40% MeOH.Matairesinoside (1): Gum, [α] 23D -48.8° (c 0.002, MeOH); UV λmax (MeOH): 279, 222; IR νmax (neat): 3373, 1760, 1600, 1514, 1452 and 1270 cm-1; ESIMS m/z 543 [M+ Na]+; 1H (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD): as published data (Shoeb et al., 2004a).Arctiin (2): Gum, [α] 23D -55.3° (c 0.0033, MeOH); UV λmax (MeOH): 279, 225; IR νmax (neat): 3459, 1765, 1591, 1460 and 1266 cm-1; CIMS m/z 552 [M+ NH4]+; 1H (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD): as published data (Shoeb et al., 2004a).DPPH assay2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), molecular formula C18H12N5O6, was obtained from Fluka Chemie AG, Bucks. Quercetin was obtained from Avocado Research Chemicals Ltd, Shore road, Heysham, Lancs. The method used by Takao et al. (1994) was adopted with suitable modifi cations (Kumarasamy et al. 2002). DPPH (4 mg) was dissolved in MeOH (50 mL) to obtain a concentration of 80 μg/mL.Qualitative assay: Test samples (MeOH extract, 1 and 2) were applied on a TLC plate and sprayed with DPPH solution using an atomiser. It was allowed to develop for 30 min. The colour changes (purple on white) were noted.Quantitative assay: The MeOH extract, and test compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in MeOH to obtain a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Dilutions were made to obtain concentrations of 5 x 10-1, 5 x 10-2, 5 x 10-3, 5 x 10-4, 5 x 10-5, 5 x 10-6 5 x 10-7, 5 x 10-8, 5 x 10-9, 5 x 10-10 mg/mL. Diluted solutions (1.00 mL each) were mixed with DPPH (1.00 mL) and allowed to stand for 30 min for any reaction to occur. The UV absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the average absorption was noted for each concentration. The same procedure was followed for the positive standards (quercetin). Brine shrimp lethality assayShrimp eggs were purchased from The Pet Shop, Kittybrewster Shopping Complex, Aberdeen, UK. The bioassay was conducted following the procedure described by Meyer et al. (1982). The eggs were hatched in a conical fl ask containing 300 mL artifi cial seawater. The fl asks were well aerated with the aid of an air pump, and kept in a water bath at 29-30 °C. A bright light source was left on and the nauplii hatched within 48 h. The methanol extracts of two species and the test compounds (1 and 2) were dissolved in 20% aq. DMSO to obtain a concentration of 1 mg/mL. These were serially diluted two-times, and seven different concentrations were obtained. A solution of each concentration (1 mL) was transferred into clean sterile universal vials with pipette, and aerated sea-water (9 mL) was added. About 10 nauplii were transferred into each vial with pipette. A check count was performed and the number alive after 24 h was noted. LD50s were determined using the Probit analysis method (Finney, 1971).MTT cytotoxicity assayCaCo-2 cells were maintained in Earle’s minimum essential medium (Sigma), supplemented 157Bioactivity of two Turkish endemic Centaurea species, and their major constituents           Rev. Bras. Farmacogn.Braz J. Pharmacogn.17(2): Abr./Jun. 2007with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (Labtech Int.), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycine (Sigma). Exponentially growing cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells cm-2 into 96-well plates and incubated for 72 h before the addition of drugs. Stock solution of compounds was initially in DMSO or H2O and further diluted with fresh complete medium.The growth-inhibitory effects of the methanol extracts of two Centaurea species and the test compounds (1-2) were assessed using the standard tetrazolium MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983). After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and 100 μL of MTT reagent (1 mg/mL) in serum free medium was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed and pure DMSO (200 μL) was added to each well. The metabolised MTT product dissolved in DMSO was quantifi ed by reading the absorbance at 560 nm on a micro plate reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). The IC50 values were calculated from the equation of the logarithmic line determined by fi tting the best line (Microsoft Excel) to the curve formed from the data. The IC50 value was obtained from the equation y = 50 (50% value).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe MeOH extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera were tested for antioxidant activity, general toxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively, by the DPPH assay, the brine shrimp lethality and the MTT cytotoxicity assays. The crude MeOH extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera showed signifi cant levels of free radical scavenging activity (antioxidant activity) (IC50 = 51.6 x 10-2 and 53.6 x 10-2 mg/mL) in the DPPH assay (Table 1) which was due to the presence of two lignans, matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2) with signifi cant antioxidant properties (IC50 = 2.2 x 10-3 and 16.0 x 10-2 and mg/mL, respectively). The brine shrimp lethality assay has been demonstrated to be an effective, robust and rapid assay method for primary screening of compounds for potential cytotoxic activities (Meyer et al., 1982). The MeOH extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera were found to possess similar levels of general toxicities with the LD50 values of 115.5 x 10-2 and 120.0 x 10-2 mg/mL, respectively (Table 1). Again, the lignans 1 and 2, as the major components present in the extracts, contributed to this activity (LD50 values of 1.6 x 10-2 and 9.8 x 10-2 mg/mL, respectively).While none of the extracts demonstrated any signifi cant cytotoxicity against the CaCo-2 colon cancer cell line in the MTT assay (IC50 = >1000 μg/mL), the isolated lignans (1 and 2) showed considerable cytotoxicity (Table 1). The IC50 values for matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2) were 220 and 288 μM.

Pharmacogn.17(2): Abr./Jun. 2007compounds from inactive extracts or fractions as the amounts of active compounds present in the amounts of extracts or fractions tested can be too small to show any activity (Shoeb et al., 2006a).Reversed phase HPLC analyses of the 40% Sep-Pak fraction of the methanol extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera afforded two known bioactive dibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignans, matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2). The structures of these compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, and also by direct comparison with the respective published data (Shoeb et al., 2004a). Compounds 1 and 2 displayed characteristic UV absorption maxima of dibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignans (Shoeb et al., 2004a). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of these compounds also supported this fact. A CIMS spectrum of 2 revealed the [M+NH4]+ ion peak at m/z 552, suggesting Mr = 534, and the molecular formula C27H34O11. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 2 were identical to those published for arctiin (2) (Shoeb et al., 2004a). A combination of HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY 2D NMR spectral analyses led to the unambiguous assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals of 2 and confi rmed unequivocally its identity as arctiin (2).The 1H and 13C NMR data of 1 were similar to those of arctiin (2) with the exception that one methoxyl signal was missing. The CIMS spectrum of 1 revealed [M+NH4]+ ion at m/z 538, suggesting Mr = 520, and the molecular formula C26H32O11 which also confi rmed the fi ndings from the NMR data that it contained 14 mass units less than arctiin (2), i.e. instead of a methoxyl group, it had a hydroxyl group present. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 1 were in good agreement with the published data of matairesinoside (Shoeb et al., 2004a). Using the HPLC-PDA-based ‘dereplication’ protocol, the lignans 1 and 2 were also unambiguously identifi ed in the 40% Sep-Pak fraction of the MeOH extract of C. mucronifera, and so was not processed for further purifi cation. These lignans were previously reported from a few other species of the genus Centaurea (ISI database, 2006; Shoeb et al., 2004a). However, this is the fi rst report on the occurrence of matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2) in C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera. The co-occurrence of these dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans (1 and 2) within the genus Centaurea might be chemotaxonomically signifi cant.The overall bioactivity profi les of the MeOH extracts of C. urvillei subs. armata and C. mucronifera were almost identical (Table 1). It is interesting, but not unexpected, to note that both extracts have the same chemical profi les as well, and contain matairesinoside (1) and arctiin (2) as the  major bioactive compounds.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank the EPSRC National Mass Spectrometry Service Centre (Department of Chemistry, University of Wales Swansea, Swansea, Wales, UK) for CIMS analyses.REFERENCESCarlini EA, Rodrigues E, Mendes FR, Tabach R, Gianfratti B 2006.
