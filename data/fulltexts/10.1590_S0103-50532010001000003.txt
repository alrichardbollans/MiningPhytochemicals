Extrato de folhas de Piper scutifolium apresentou atividade antifúngica significativa contra 
Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum e seus principais componentes ativos, 
piperina, piperlonguminina e corcovadina foram isolados por meio de purificação biomonitorada, 
apresentando limites de detecção de 1 µg. Foi realizado um estudo da relação estrutura-atividade 
baseado na síntese de doze análogos com variações no número de insaturações, no padrão de 
substituição no anel aromático e no grupo amídico. As amidas sem substituintes no anel aromático 
e com apenas uma ligação dupla foram as mais ativas e os derivados N,N-dietil-substituídos 
apresentam maior dose-dependência.
The antifungal leaves extract from Piper scutifolium was submitted to bioactivity-guided 
chromatographic separation against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum 
yielding piperine, piperlonguminine and corcovadine as the active principles which displayed a 
detection limit of 1 µg. Structure-activity relationships were investigated with the preparation of 
twelve analogs having differences in the number of unsaturations, aromatic ring substituents and 
in the amide moiety. Analogs having a single double-bond and no substituent in the aromatic ring 
displayed higher activity, while N,N,-diethyl analogs displayed higher dose-dependent activity.

Introduction
Piper (Piperaceae) are commonly herbs, shrubs or 
infrequently trees with over 1000 species described so far 
mostly on tropical regions.1 In addition to the high economical 
value of black pepper (P. nigrum) as a spice, there are 
several medicinal uses described for different Piper species, 
including anti-inflammatory, analgesic and treatment of 
snake-bite.2,3 Several Piper species have been phytochemicaly 
investigated4-6 and a plethora of secondary metabolites has been 
found including kavalactones,7,8 lignoids,9-11 chromenes,12,13 
terpenes,14,15 prenylated benzoic acids13,16,17 and also amides 
as the most characteristic classes of compounds.18,19
The most prominent example of a Piper amide is 
piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper (P. nigrum). 
It was the first natural product isolated from Piper species 
back in 1819. Piperine and several other amides have 
shown a variety of biological activity, e.g., antitumoral,20-22 
efflux-pump inhibitor,23-25 insecticidal19,26-36 and antifungal 
activity.37-39 The importance of insecticidal activity of 
Piper amides is considerable and thus several studies 
have been addressed to investigate possible structure-
activity relationships. For instance, isobutylamides have 
shown high activity against different insects including 
Musca domestica,40 Aedes aegypti36 and A. togoi41 and 
compounds bearing methylenedioxyphenyl substituents 
can act in some cases as synergists for other compounds by 
interfering with cytochrome P450-mediated detoxifications 
of insecticides.34,42,43 In spite of the occurrence of several 
antifungal amides in plants,37,38,44,45 the data concerning the 
mechanism of action for such compounds is scarce and 
thus a comprehensive structure-activity relationship studies 
could not be performed so far. 
In the course of bioprospecting studies for antifungal 
compounds from Piperaceae species,12,37,46-48 leaf extracts 
from P. scutifolium displayed significant activity against 
the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides 
and C. sphaerospermum. The dereplication of extracts by 
Antifungal Activity of Natural and Synthetic Amides from Piper species J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1808
a combined chromatographic and bioautographic method 
yielded the amides piperine (4), piperlonguminine (2e) 
and corcovadine (5) (Figure 1) as the major bioactive 
compounds. Since the detection limit of 1 µg was 
comparable to that of positive controls miconazole and 
nystatin, several analogs were synthesized in order to 
evaluate preliminary structure-activity relationships.
Experimental
General experimental procedures 
UV spectra were recorded in a UV/Visible Shimadzu 
UV-1601PC spectrophotometer using CHCl3 as solvent. 
IR spectra were obtained in a Perkin-Elmer model 1750 
spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 
300 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 75 MHz in Bruker 
DPX-200 and DRX-300 spectrometers, respectively. 
CDCl3 (Aldrich) was used as solvent and TMS (Aldrich) 
as internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in d units 
(ppm) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. GCLREIMS were 
measured in a Shimadzu GC-17A chromatograph interfaced 
with a MS-QP-5050A mass spectrometer. Temperature 
programming was performed from 150 to 300 °C at 
15 °C min−1, then isothermal at 300 °C for 5 min. The injector 
and detector temperatures were 150 and 320 °C, respectively, 
and helium was used as a carrier gas. Analytical HPLC was 
performed using a Dionex C18 (150 × 5 mm i.d. × 3 µm) 
column with UVD-DAD 340U as a detector. Silica gel 
(Merck, 230-400 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham 
Biosciences) were used for column chromatographic 
separation, while silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck) was used for 
analytical (0.25 mm) and preparative TLC (1.0 mm). 
Plant material
P. scutifolium Jack. leaves were collected in Ubatuba, 
SP, Brazil, in September 2002 and identified by 
Dr. Elsie Franklin Guimarães (Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim 
Botânico do Rio de Janeiro). Voucher specimen (Kato-281) 
was deposited at the Herbarium of the Jardim Botânico do 
Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. Dried fruits of P. nigrum were 
purchased in the local market.
Extraction and isolation 
Dried and powdered leaves of P. scutifolium (10 g) 
were exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2. Crude extract 
was fractionated through successive chromatography 
as previously described to yield piperlonguminine 
(4 mg, mp 157-160 °C) and corcovadine (10 mg, 
mp 143-145 °C).47 To obtain piperine, dried fruits of 
P. nigrum (1 kg) were crushed, extracted with ethanol 
and yielded a crystaline solid after concentration under 
vacuum. Successive recrystallization in EtOH yielded pure 
piperine (200 mg, mp 129-131 °C) which was identified 
based on comparison of 1H and 13C NMR data with those 
reported.49
Synthetic procedures
Compounds 1c, 1d, 2c, 2d e 3c were synthesized using 
Wadsworth-Emmons according to Strunz and Finlay’s 
method.50 The starting aldehydes reacted with triethyl-
phosphonocrotonate yielding ethyl 5-phenylpentadienoates. 
The ester products were then hydrolysed without further 
purification to the corresponding carboxylic acid, 
(2E,4E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienoic acid (6) and (2E,4E)-
5-(3-methoxyphenyl)penta-2,4-dienoic acid (7). Their 
corresponding chlorides obtained by reaction with oxalyl 
chloride reacted with amines yielding the desired amides 
with an overall yield of ca. 80%. Compounds 1d and 2d 
were synthesized according to de Paula and co-workers,32 
with piperic acid obtained from piperine hydrolysis which 
was then converted into the desired amides similarly as 
above described. Amides 1a, 2a and 3c were prepared

synthesized from commercial benzo[d][1,3]dioxole-
5-carbaldehyde (8) which was converted into (E)-3-
(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl) acrylic acid (9), yielding the 
amides as above described.51
Spectroscopic data of 1a, 1e, 2a, 3e, 6 and 9 were in 
accordance with those published.32,51-54 Compounds 1d and 
3c were not previously described.

Antifungal assay
The microorganisms used in the antifungal assay, 
Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 
and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491, have been 
maintained at the Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, 
Brazil. The assay was carried out for all amides and their 
activities determined as previously described (Table 3).47 
Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls 
whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as 
negative controls.61
Results and Discussion
Natural amides were isolated through successive 
chromatographic procedures as previously described.47 
Analogs of (2E, 4E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienamides and 
(E)-cinnamamides were synthesized (Figure 2) aiming at 
determination of overall effect of aromatic ring substitution 
and nitrogen substituent in antifungal activity.62,63 The 
importance of the amide moiety for the antifungal activity 
was investigated by replacing the natural piperidyl, isobutyl 
or its acetylated derivative by N,N-diethyl or N-pentyl 
analogs.
The replacement of isobutyl or piperidyl moieties by 
diethyl groups in (2E, 4E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienamides 
resulted in a noticeable increase in the dose-response 
activity, as observed for amides 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d and 1e 
against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. 
Some selectivity was detected between the two strains in 
which C. sphaerospermum was more sensible to 1e than 
C. cladosporioides (Table 1). 
Analysis of aromatic substitution pattern indicated 
that amides having methylenedioxy or methoxyl groups 
displayed lower antifungal potency when compared to 
those having no substituents. The amides 2a, 2c, 3a and 
3c displayed higher activities at 1 µg against both strains 
while 1d, 3b and 3e were the least active among all amides 
assayed against C. cladosporioides. At lower concentrations 
N-isobutyl and N-pentyl derivatives (2a-2e, 3a-3c and 3e) 
showed higher activity. In this case, there is an apparent 
positive correlation with the lipophylicity and the amides 
having a α,β-conjugated carbonyl were more active than 
those having an extended α,β,γ,d-conjugated system.
Conclusions
Investigation of natural and synthetic amides as 
antifungal compounds have shown preliminary structure-
activity relationship in which N,N-diethyl showed higher 
dose dependent activity while N-pentyl and N-isobutyl 
derivatives showed lower detection limit. In general, 
substituents in the aromatic ring such as methoxyl and 
methylenedioxy decreased antifungal activity and the 
shorter aliphatic chain, the higher activity was observed.

Further investigations including quantitative biological 
activity assessment and determination of physicochemical 
descriptors are required for a thorough understanding of 
the observed antifungal activities and in the development 
of effective antifungal agents.
