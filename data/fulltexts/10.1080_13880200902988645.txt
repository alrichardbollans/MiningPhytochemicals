Introduction: center organization
The Iowa Botanical Center is unique among Office of 
Dietary Supplements (ODS) Botanical Supplements 
Research Centers in that we have demonstrated the 
capacity to harness interdisciplinary research on the 
genetic, developmental, and biochemical diversity of 
Echinacea, Hypericum, and Prunella species to improve 
our understanding of the key constituents that contrib-
ute to their bioactivity. The range of variation in these 
plants, when systematically analyzed, provides a strong 
foundation on which to develop the strategies and tools

Abstract
The Iowa Center for Research on Botanical Dietary Supplements seeks to optimize Echinacea, Hypericum, 
and Prunella botanical supplements for human-health benefit, emphasizing anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, 
and anti-pain activities. This mini-review reports on ongoing studies on Hypericum. The Center uses the 
genetically diverse, well-documented Hypericum populations collected and maintained at the USDA-ARS 
North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS), and the strength of research in synthetic chem-
istry at Iowa State University to tap natural diversity, to help discover key constituents and interactions 
among constituents that impact bioactivity and toxicity. The NCRPIS has acquired more than 180 distinct 
populations of Hypericum, with a focus on Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae), representing about 
13% of currently recognized taxa. Center chemists have developed novel synthetic pathways for key fla-
vones, acyl phloroglucinols, hyperolactones, and a tetralin that have been found in Hypericum, and these 
compounds are used as standards and for bioactivity studies. Both light-dependent and light-independent 
anti-viral activities have been identified by using bioactivity-guided fractionation of H. perforatum and a 
HIV-1 infection test system. Our Center has focused on light-independent activity, potentially due to novel 
chemicals, and polar fractions are undergoing further fractionation. Anti-inflammatory activity has been 
found to be light-independent, and fractionation of a flavonoid-rich extract revealed four compounds 
(amentoflavone, chlorogenic acid, pseudohypericin, and quercetin) that interacted in the light to inhibit 
lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 activity. The Center continues to explore novel populations 
of H. perforatum and related species to identify constituents and interactions of constituents that contrib-
ute to potential health benefits related to infection.

needed to produce the most efficacious products for a 
growing body of consumers. This mini-review will focus 
on some of our work with Hypericum.
Our general approach is to identify chemical pro-
files and the key compounds that define these plants’ 
bioactivity, and to provide a context that can be used to 
reinterpret past studies and, in turn, serve as the basis 
for future research. The primary goal of our Center is to 
improve our understanding of the characteristics that 
contribute to health benefits and optimize these sup-
plements for study in future clinical trials. Our Center 
comprises three projects focused on anti-viral, anti-
inflammatory, and anti-pain activities, respectively, 
and three cores that provide key services in support 
of these projects: Germplasm and Phytochemical 
Profiling; Separations/Structure/Bioavailability; and 
Administration, Data Management, Statistics, and 
Bioinformatics.
The overarching objectives of our Center are to:
identify the compounds that contribute to the anti-•	
viral, anti-inflammatory, and pain-control effects, 
and those contributing to their toxicity;
assess the influence of plant species and population •	
on the bioactive constituents in these genera;
understand the mechanisms of action of bioactive •	
constituents – in particular the cellular-signaling 
pathways and receptors that are critical for their 
bioactivity – and the effects of their interactions;
assess the bioavailability of key constituents of these •	
supplements and the effects of their complex chemi-
cal profiles on bioavailability.
Given the long and diverse history of traditional 
 medicinal uses of H. perforatum in Europe, including 
its use as an agent to reduce inflammation and promote 
healing (Bombardelli & Morazzoni, 1995), this species 
fits especially well with our ongoing research.
Genetic resources and production of  
well-characterized plant material
A unique resource of the Center is our collection of 
a genetically diverse set of well-documented plant 
populations of Echinacea, Hypericum, and Prunella 
being conserved at the US Department of Agriculture-
Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) North 
Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS). 
The NCRPIS, located at Iowa State University, is one 
of the main active genebanks in the US National Plant 
Germplasm System (NPGS) (McCoy, 2007), with sig-
nificant collections of medicinal-plant germplasm. 
Efforts to assemble the NCRPIS Echinacea collection 
were described by Widrlechner and McKeown (2002), 
and a recent overview of this important collection and 
its relationship to the Center was presented by Birt 
et al. (2008). The NCRPIS Prunella collection is a recent 
development, resulting from the inclusion of this genus 
in research projects incorporated into the Center’s 2007 
Project Renewal, while the more extensive NCRPIS 
Hypericum collection is described in detail below. These 
resources provide Center researchers with control over 
the production of known-source plant materials and 
a common basis for studies in genomic analysis and 
broad-based plant metabolic profiling, enhancing our 
ability to integrate complex datasets by using bioinfor-
matics and other statistical tools.
Since the late 1990s, the NCRPIS has acquired 
more than 180 distinct populations (or accessions) of 
Hypericum, currently representing about 60 taxa, or 
~13% of currently recognized taxa (Robson, 2003), with 
an emphasis on H. perforatum and its close relatives. 
Because representation of the 400+ species of Hypericum 
(Robson, 2003) is currently incomplete, efforts will 
be taken to improve coverage, both for those species 
most closely related to H. perforatum and for a broad, 
stratified sample of other taxonomic sections within 
the genus. Dr. Norman Robson, an expert in Hypericum 
 systematics, has agreed to serve as an advisor on both 
our acquisition and characterization efforts. New collec-
tions are being obtained both through exchange relation-
ships with other institutions and through targeted field 
collections. For example, an NPGS-funded collection 
trip to the Republic of Georgia focusing on medicinal 
plants was conducted in August–September 2007. The 
Republic of Georgia was selected due to the high degree 
of Hypericum biodiversity represented in the region.
The genetic integrity of each Hypericum accession is 
preserved by regenerating seed samples under control-
led conditions (systems described by Widrlechner et al., 
1997 and Brenner & Widrlechner, 1998) in screened 
field cages with insect pollinators or, in the greenhouse, 
in mesh tents under controlled-temperature conditions 
to reduce the possibility of infection by the debilitat-
ing fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides 
(Hildebrand & Jensen, 1991). Because this destruc-
tive anthracnose pathogen can be seedborne, we have 
developed a Colletotrichum blotter test to screen germi-
nating seeds for fungal contamination, with 61% of our 
Hypericum collection now screened. All germination 
and pathogen data collected have been entered in the 
Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) 
database (US Department of Agriculture, 2007).
During seed regeneration, taxonomic identities are 
verified and populations are being characterized for 
phenotypic traits following a standardized descriptor 
list. Detailed passport data describing each accession 
are available from the GRIN database. Phenotypic 
776  Diane F . Birt et al.
descriptors along with images of the accessions are cur-
rently being assembled. Seeds of all available accessions 
are distributed for research and educational purposes 
at no cost to the user and can be accessed via the GRIN 
database.
Hypericum samples used by Center researchers have 
typically been produced from NCRPIS accessions col-
lected from a variety of sources, including both wild 
populations and commercial varieties. By using these 
accessions produced under known conditions, we 
minimize both the genetic and environmental compo-
nents of biochemical variation in the resulting products, 
which increases the overall repeatability of bioassays 
in our Center’s projects. Replicated field plantings of 
four accessions of H. perforatum were established in 
2003 and expanded the following year to include three 
more accessions by Center researchers, Drs. Kathleen 
Delate and Fredy Romero, to optimize production of 
 above-ground vegetative material. These plots were 
maintained through 2005, when a Colletotrichum 
 infection was identified.
Fifty-six Hypericum accessions representing 11 spe-
cies were supplied to Dr. Jonathan Wendel’s laboratory 
for genetic-diversity studies and to identify species-
 specific amplified fragment length polymorphism 
(AFLP) markers for taxonomic identification (Percifield 
et al., 2007). Similarly, 76 Hypericum samples were sup-
plied to Dr. Eve Wurtele’s laboratory to develop chemical 
fingerprints for various accessions and identify bioactive 
compounds of interest. Percifield et al. (2007) recently 
identified 17 AFLP markers present in all 42 H. perfora-
tum accessions evaluated; of these, two were unique to 
H. perforatum. The unique markers may be valuable for 
raw-material verification. All of the materials provided 
for these two projects were collected,  taxonomically 
verified, and propagated by Center researchers, Drs. 
Joe-Ann McCoy and Mark Widrlechner. After  production 
and processing, all plant samples for Center use are 
inventoried with a standardized coding system, and 
unextracted dried plant materials are packaged in nitro-
gen and stored frozen at −20°C.
Chemical synthesis of key phytochemicals
As part of a multidisciplinary effort to identify new bio-
active constituents from Echinacea and Hypericum, we 
required flexible synthetic routes to produce the key 
flavones and acyl phloroglucinols present in Hypericum. 
Access to highly pure standards is important for both 
chemical profiling among species and for biological 
evaluation. Although synthetic routes to individual 
flavones have been reported (Marais et al., 2005), no 
synthesis of flavones or acyl phloroglucinols from ben-
zodioxinones had been reported.
Apigenin is a natural antioxidant flavone that occurs 
in a number of Hypericum species (Kartnig et al., 1996). 
It has been shown to promote cell-cycle arrest and 
apoptosis in various malignant cell lines and is also a 
potent inhibitor of glucosyltransferase activity (Viola 
et al., 1995). Our methodology has been applied to a 
direct synthesis of apigenin. Unexpectedly, the reac-
tion of the enolate of para-methoxyacetophenone 
returned starting materials. As shown in Figure 1, the 
lithium diisopropylamide-derived enolate of para-
benzenesulfonyloxyacetophenone reacted efficiently 
with the benzodioxinone to produce the -diketone, 
which was cyclized and deprotected to provide api-
genin in 40% overall yield. The proton and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of our synthetic 
material matched the spectra of an authentic sample 
(Kraus & Wei, 2004).
Acyl phloroglucinols, a diverse class of natural prod-
ucts that exhibit antibacterial activity, anticancer activ-
ity, and antitubercular activity, are broadly distributed 
among plant families. Several species of Hypericum 
 contain biologically active acyl phloroglucinols 
(Gibbons et al., 2005). We recently synthesized the acyl 
 phloroglucinol shown in Figure 1 from the benzodioxi-
none. This compound can serve as an intermediate to 
more complex acyl phloroglucinols.
The hyperolactones constitute a growing class of novel 
metabolites found in Hypericum species (Aramaki et al., 
1995). The structure of hyperolactone C is depicted in 
Figure 1. In the context of a study of Hypericum metabo-
lites through bioassay-guided fractionation, we required 
an authentic sample of hyperolactone C, whose extended 
conjugation and resemblance to known antiviral agents 
made it a metabolite of interest. Kinoshita and cowork-
ers reported interesting syntheses of hyperolactone C 
from chiral precursors (Ichinari et al., 1997). Although 
their synthesis defined the absolute stereochemistry, a 
more direct synthetic approach was needed to support 
biological studies. We synthesized hyperolactone C in

four steps from commercially available starting materi-
als (Kraus & Wei, 2004), via a tandem Claisen/lactoniza-
tion reaction.
A novel tetralin (Figure 1) was isolated from H. elo-
deoides Choisy (Mathela et al., 1984). We prepared this 
tetralin from 3-methylcatechol by way of a stereoselec-
tive electrophilic cyclization onto a protected catechol 
(Kraus & Jeon, 2006).
Anti-viral screening using HIV-1
Light-dependent antiviral activities of H. perforatum 
have been extensively explored by others (Hudson 
et al., 1991; Jacobson et al., 2001; Laurent et al., 2005; 
Naesens et al., 2006). This light-dependent, anti-viral 
activity against various enveloped viruses, but not 
non- enveloped viruses, has been ascribed to the 
H. perforatum naphthodianthrones, hypericin and 
 pseudohypericin (Kraus et al., 1990; Lopez-Bazzocchi 
et al., 1991; Degar et al., 1992; Carpenter et al., 1994; 
Lavie et al., 1995; Vyas, 1995; Farnet et al., 1998; Park 
et al., 1998). Hypericin, when exposed to light, displays 
multiple modes of anti-viral activity, including inhibi-
tion of budding of new virions (Meruelo et al., 1988), 
cross-linking of capsids preventing viral uncoating 
(Degar et al., 1992), and inhibition of protein kinase 
activity required for replication of a number of viruses 
(De Witte et al., 1993; Agostinis et al., 1995). The obser-
vation that hypericin specifically inhibits enveloped 
viruses strongly implicates membrane-associated 
events as central to the inhibition. Consistent with this, 
light-sensitized hypericin is directly viricidal to these 
viruses (Kuhn, 1995; Lavie et al., 1995; Vyas, 1995). 
We evaluated the ability of hypericin to inhibit human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication in a short 
term infectivity assay. Consistent with other reports, 
a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 expression was 
observed when hypericin was added at the time of 
infection under ambient light conditions (Figure 2). 
However, the light-dependent nature of the anti-viral 
activity of hypericin reduces the potential applicability 
of this compound for in vivo studies.
Additional anti-viral studies performed at the Iowa 
Center for Research on Botanical Dietary Supplements 
found that H. perforatum extracts also contain light-
independent anti-HIV-1 activity. Chloroform extracts of 
H. perforatum that lacked detectable levels of naphthodi-
anthrones were used as the starting material in bioassay-
guided fractionation studies to identify light-independent 
anti-HIV-1 activity. Extracts were fractionated through a 
series of three successive column  chromatography experi-
ments, and the fractions obtained were assayed for anti-
HIV-1 activity (Figure 3A). At each step, the most polar 
fractions were found to contain constituents that inhibited 
HIV infection in a dose-dependent, but light-independent 
manner. As early as the initial fractionation, material eluted 
in methanol had significant anti-HIV-1 activity in both 
light and dark conditions (Figure 3B). Further purification 
provided evidence of anti-HIV-1 activity in the absence of 
cell cytotoxicity (Figure 3C). Continued fractionation of 
the most advanced active fractions (E4.7 and E4.8) must 
be conducted to identify the botanical constituents that 
confer this novel antiviral activity.
Anti-inflammatory screening using 
RAW264.7 macrophages
The primary approach taken to assess the anti-
 inflammatory activity of Hypericum was to measure the 
influence of accessions of H. perforatum on lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E
2
 (PGE
2
) 
production by RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. Anti-
inflammatory activity of different accessions of H. per-
foratum was studied in Soxhlet chloroform and Soxhlet 
ethanol extracts at the highest concentrations, and all 
accessions inhibited PGE
2
 production in LPS-induced 
RAW264.7 macrophages (Hammer et al., 2007). Dilution 
studies suggest that the constituents that account for the 
anti-inflammatory activity of H. perforatum accessions 
are extracted by either chloroform or ethanol, indicating 
that hypericin and related compounds that would only be

molecular clone, pNL4-3 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.005), 
was incubated with permissive HeLa37 cells that express CD4 and 
CXCR4. Three-fold serial dilutions of hypericin were added to the 
infections. The mixture was incubated under ambient light conditions 
within the laboratory for 10 min prior to incubation at 37°C in a tis-
sue culture incubator. Cells were fixed at 40 h following infection and 
immunostained for HIV-1 antigens as previously described (Reed-
Inderbitzin & Maury, 2003). HIV antigen-positive cells were enumer-
ated. The number of HIV-1 positive cells observed in the presence of 
hypericin was divided by the number of HIV-1 positive cells found in 
the absence of hypericin, shown as % control values. In parallel, the 
cytotoxicity of the extract was evaluated in HeLa37 cells in an ATP 
Lite assay (Packard Instruments) and those values are shown as the 
number of cells that are viable in the presence of hypericin divided by 
the number of viable cells in the presence of vehicle alone.

present in the ethanol extract do not account for this bioac-
tivity. The most active accession, Ames 27452 ‘Medizinal’ , 
marketed under the name Elixir™, was developed using 
conventional plant breeding for higher concentrations of 
putative bioactive compounds, which was reflected in its 
relatively high concentration of total flavonoids in a multi-
accession evaluation (Gaudin et al., 2003), and its more 
potent anti-inflammatory activity as reported by Hammer 
et al. (2007), supporting the success of this strategy.
Several constituents of Hypericum, including hyper-
forin, hypericin, pseudohypericin, quercetin, quercitrin, 
isoquercitrin, rutin, amentoflavone, and chlorogenic 
acid, were studied for their impact on LPS-induced PGE
2
 
production (Hammer et al., 2007). Based on the concen-
trations of these chemicals in the extracts and fractions, 
none of these constituents alone could account for the 
anti-inflammatory activity. However, it is possible that 
concentrations of specific flavonoids, such as amento-
flavone, that would not inhibit PGE
2
 production in their 
pure forms, were effective in the fractions and extracts in 
the presence of other compounds.
Because of published evidence that flavonoids pos-
sess anti-inflammatory activity (Middleton Jr et al., 
2000), and from the similar anti-inflammatory activity 
of the ethanol and chloroform extracts, which would 
both contain flavonoids, H. perforatum was fractionated 
to generate flavonoid-rich fractions (sequential hexane, 
ethanol, then chloroform extracts). The fraction with 
the greatest concentrations of flavonoids from the first 
round of fractionation was the most anti-inflammatory. 
Further fractionation by column chromatography with a 
gradient from chloroform to 50:50 acetonitrile/ methanol 
yielded a fraction with similar anti- inflammatory activ-
ity. Subsequently, subfractionation of this second-round 
active fraction yielded fraction 3A where four constitu-
ents (amentoflavone, chlorogenic acid, pseudohyper-
icin, and quercetin) were identified and quantified by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Figure 4) 
(Hammer et al., 2008). A proportional combination 
of these constituents was then used for assessment 
in the LPS-induced PGE
2
 assay. In the light, the 1 × 4

(B) Methanol extracted fractions had equivalent ability to inhibit HIV infection in light and dark. Chloroform extracts of H. perforatum were 
extracted with hexane, chloroform, or methanol and the methanol fraction was analyzed for anti-HIV activity. The HIV-1 molecular clone, 
pNL4-3, was incubated with HeLa37 cells in the presence of 10-fold dilutions of the methanol fraction under ambient light or low light conditions 
for 10 min. Hypericin was evaluated in parallel and served as the light-dependent control. At 40 h following infection, cells were fixed and immu-
nostained for HIV antigens. Shown is the percent reduction of HIV positive cells in the presence of hypericin or extract compared to the number 
of HIV positive cells in the presence of vehicle alone. (C) The ability of increasing concentrations of subfraction E4.8 to inhibit HIV infectivity. 
Subfraction concentrations were incubated with HIV-1 and HeLa37 cells over a 40 h period. Cells were acetone fixed and evaluated for HIV posi-
tivity. The cytotoxicity of increasing concentrations of the subfraction to HeLa37 cells is also shown as the cell viability relative to control.

constituents in the amounts found in fraction 3A inhib-
ited LPS-induced production of PGE
2
 by nearly as much 
as fraction 3A (Figure 5). However, it was clear that no 
one constituent was present at a high enough concen-
tration to account for this degree of inhibition (Table 1). 
For example, amentoflavone was found at 0.08 M in 
fraction 3A while pure amentoflavone was only effective 
at concentrations of ≥10 M. However, these data also 
highlight the possibility that unknown and/or uniden-
tified compounds significantly contribute to the light-
independent activity of fraction 3A.
Further studies of the four constituents identified 
in the four-component system showed that amen-
toflavone, chlorogenic acid, pseudohypericin, and 
quercetin were effective in inhibiting LPS-induced 
PGE
2
  primarily with light activation and only when 
combined in groups of two or three chemicals if pseu-
dohypericin was present. Further, the combinations of 
pseudohypericin with amentoflavone or quercetin, or 
all three of these constituents, were generally the most 
effective (Figure 6). Current investigations are assess-
ing the impact of these known constituents on gene

Figure 4. Extracted ion chromatographs (EIC) from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (negative ion mode) of fraction 3A 
showed that chlorogenic acid, quercetin, amentoflavone, and pseudohypericin were present, based on matching retention times and mass-to-
charge ratios (from data published in Hammer et al., 2008). The fractions were analyzed with an Agilent Technologies Ion Trap 1100 LC-ESI-MS 
(Ganzera et al., 2002).

Figure 5. Fraction 3A was compared with 1, 10, and 100× dilutions (four-component system) of the four identifiable constituents (amentofla-
vone, chlorogenic acid, pseudohypericin, and quercetin) in fraction 3A (from data published in Hammer et al., 2008). Data are presented as

Tukey–Kramer test for multiple comparisons. n = 4 for each treatment. Each fraction/four-component system was assayed in both light-activated 
and dark treatments and differences between light and dark treatments in PGE

expression and cellular-signaling pathways important 
in mediating inflammation in RAW264.7 mouse mac-
rophages. In addition, studies on other mediators of 
inflammation suggest that distinct constituents of 
H. perforatum may alter mediators of inflammation 
beyond PGE

.
Research directions
Center scientists continue to screen populations of 
H. perforatum and related species to identify anti-viral 
and anti-inflammatory activities. Bioactivity-guided 
fractionation of active extracts is anticipated to yield 
novel compounds. We plan structural-elucidation 
studies and syntheses of identified key constituents 
with the objective of improving our understanding of 
those constituents of Hypericum with potential health 
benefits. As key bioactive constituents are identified, 
molecular and cellular mechanisms of action are being 
probed.
