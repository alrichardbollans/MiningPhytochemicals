Sussex* Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama 35487 (M.D.J.); and Department of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 0651 1 (I.M.S.) A recombinant phage containing an Arabidopsis tbaliana cDNA sequence encoding a protein with 1 i-myo-inositol 1 -phosphate syn- thase (EC 5.5.1.4) activity has been isolated and used for transcrip- tional and translational studies. The identification of the recombi- nant phage relied on the observations that (a) the clone complements a mutation in the structural gene for 1 i-myo-inositol 1 -phosphate synthase in the yeast Saccbaromyces cerevisiae, (b) the in vitro synthesized polypeptide enzymatically converts glucose 6-phosphate into inositol 1 -phosphate, (c) in vitro transcription and translation of this cDNA sequence produces a polypeptide that is  recognized by anti-yeast myo-inositol 1 -phosphate synthase anti- serum, and (d) inositol regulates the expression of the correspond- ing gene in Arabidopsis. The biosynthesis and metabolism of inositol and the inositol phospholipids play a central role in the function of eukaryotic cells. Metabolic products of inositol have been shown to play a vital role in signal transmission for a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (Loewus and Loewus, 1983; Hokin, 1985; Morse et al., 1987; Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Boss, 1989; Berridge, 1993). In addition, the metabolism of inositol plays a unique role in enabling eukaryotic cells to cope with hypertonic condi- tions (Sacher and Staples, 1985; Nakanishi et al., 1989). Most eukaryotic organisms have the capacity to synthesize MI-1-P from Glc-6-P. Studies of the biosynthetic pathway of inositol were initiated with the preparation of a system capable of forming labeled inositol from labeled Glc (Eisen- berg and Bolden, 1962; Loewus and Kelly, 1962; Eisenberg et al., 1964; Chen and Charalampous, 1966). Although the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, MI-I-P synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) has been purified or partially purified from a num- ber of organisms (Loewus and Loewus, 1971,1983; Ogun- yemi et al., 1978; Maeda and Eisenberg, 1980; Donahue and Henry, 1981), the first report of the isolation and charac- This work was supported in part by a grant (DCB-8710766) to I.M.S. from the National Science Foundation.

The properties and catalytic mecha- nisms of this enzyme are similar in animals, plants, and yeast (Kiely and Sherman, 1975; Sherman et al., 1977; Loewus and Loewus, 1983; Wong and Sherman, 1985; Loewus, 1990). The absolute requirement for NAD+ with no net gain in NADH suggests that the overall reaction consists of a tightly coupled oxidation and reduction (Loewus, 1990). The INOl locus was identified as the structural gene for MI-1-P synthase in yeast (Donahue and Henry, 1981). The INOl gene was isolated by genetic complementation of the ino mutant phenotype and sequenced (Klig and Henry, 1984; Johnson and Henry, 1989). The DNA sequence of the INOl gene revealed a 553-amino acid open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 62.8 kD (Johnson and Henry, 1989). The amino acid composition and amino- terminal sequence (first eight amino acids) derived from purified yeast MI-1-P synthase were compared with the protein predicted from the sequence of the open reading frame of the INOl gene, confirming that it encodes MI-1-P synthase (Johnson and Henry, 1989). This analysis pro- vided the foundation needed to understand the complex regulatory role of inositol in phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast (Johnson and Henry, 1989). Recently, a cDNA encod- ing MI-1-P synthase was isolated and shown to be rapidly and spatially up-regulated during an ABA-induced mor- phogenic response in the aquatic angiosperm Spirodela polyrrhiza (Smart and Fleming, 1993). Although the impor- tance of inositol to higher plants (seed germination, mem- brane formation, cell wall biogenesis, hormone response, stress response, etc.) has been known for many years, less is known of the genetic regulation of its metabolism. Our objective is to isolate and study the genes involved in the regulation of inositol biosynthesis and catabolism in higher plants. To this end, we have focused our attention on the isolation and characterization of the genes and gene prod- ucts of the biosynthetic enzyme MI-1-P synthase and the catabolic enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase (EC 1.13.99.1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. In this report we describe the genetic, biochemical, and molecular analyses used to iso- Abbreviations: AIS, Arabidopsis 1-r-myo-inositol 1-phosphate; INO1, 1L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase structural gene from yeast; MI-1-P, 1L-myo-inositol I-phosphate. 61 3  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Material Wild-type seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh (strain Columbia), kindly provided by Dr. David W. Meinke (Oklahoma State University), were grown according meth- ods reported previously (Meinke and Sussex, 1979). Typi- cally, for seed production, plants were grown in 3-inch round plastic pots containing a 12:3:1 (v/v) mixture of coarse vermicu1ite:potting soi1:sterilized sand. For asepti- cally grown plants, seeds were washed in a screw-capped tube containing 5 mL of 30% (v/v) bleach and 1 pL/mL of 20% Triton X-100 and plated on plant agar medium. Plant agar medium contained Murashige and Skoog salt base (Sigma) (one package per liter), 10 mL/L lOOX stock or- ganics (0.05 g of nicotinic acid, 0.05 g of pyridoxine-HC1, 0.05 g of thiamine-HC1,O.Z g of Gly), 30 g/L SUC, and 7 g/L agar. The pH was adjusted to 5.7 to 5.8 with 1 N KOH. A. thaliana seedlings were collected and frozen in liquid nitro- gen after 1 to 2 weeks of growth in an environmental chamber maintained at 24°C on a 16-h light/8-h dark (LD) cycle. Complementation of Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae inositol mutant strain inol-13, trpl ,  his3, leu2, ura3 was a gift from Dr. Susan Henry (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA). A yeast transformation protocol (Burgers and Percival, 1987) was used to transform the inositol mutant strain with the plas- mid portion of an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library (A Yes-R) kindly provided by Dr. Ronald W. Davis (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). The A Yes vector is capable of replicating as a A phage, a plasmid lysogen in Escherichia cozi, or as a centromere plasmid in yeast (Elledge et al., 1991). Yeast complementation analysis (Johnston, 1988) and media for growth of yeast inol strains have been described (Culbertson et al., 1976). Yeast Plasmid lsolation Autonomous plasmids were rescued from yeast using the protocol of Kenneth and Kassir (1992). Plasmid DNA was isolated from a 1.5-mL culture grown overnight under selective conditions. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 20 pL of water and 10 pL was used to transform the E.  coli XL-Blue strain (Stratagene) according to the procedure of Chung et al. (1989). Subcloning In the multifunctional A Yes vector, cDNAs are inserted into an XhoI site (Elledge et al., 1991). The inserts from the cDNAs were isolated by digestion with XhoI and subcloned into the XhoI site of pBluescript I1 SK vector (Stratagene). The bacterial strain XL-Blue was used for a11 bacterial transformations and subsequent isolation of plasmids for further analysis. Protein lsolation Proteins were extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings grown aseptically in Petri dishes on plant agar medium without inositol and with various concentrations of inosi- tol. One hundred milligrams of tissue were crushed in a mortar cooled by liquid nitrogen and resuspended at 0°C in 2 mL of buffer (Colas Des Francs et al., 1985). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis (Towbin et al., 1979) was per- formed on proteins separated in SDS polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) and transferred to nitrocellulose mem- branes. The yeast polyclonal antibody to MI-1-P synthase (Donahue and Henry, 1981) was used as a probe. Southern Analysis Southern analysis (Southern, 1975) was used to locate the cDNA sequence within the Arabidopsis genome. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole plants as described by Jofuku and Goldberg (1988). Arabidopsis genomic restric- tion fragments were separated in 0.7% agarose gels accord- ing to the method of Sambrook et al. (1989). Northern Analysis For northern analysis (Thomas, 19801, total RNA was extracted as described by Cox and Goldberg (1988), sub- jected to two cycles of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography to isolate poly(A)+ RNA (Cox and Goldberg, 1988), and subjected to electrophoresis in 1 % formaldehyde gels. Probes High specific activity (10' cpm/pg) radiolabeled RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro by substituting [32P]CTP or [32P]UTP for cold CTP or UTP in a standard transcription protocol (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucle- otides and template DNA were removed by size exclusion chromatography through a small Sephadex G-50 column in 10 mM Tris-C1, pH 7.5, and 0.1% SDS. In Vitro Transcription Intact RNA transcripts were synthesized and capped using an mRNA-capping kit (Stratagene) and protocol. The AIS clone was digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme for utilization of the T7 promoter (Fig. 1). After digestion, the DNA was treated with proteinase K, ex- tracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. After 60 min of incubation of the DNA template and Strat- agene's mCAP reagents at 37"C, the capped RNA was separated from the DNA template by incubation for 5 min more at 37°C with DNase I. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated.

In Vitro Translation The rabbit reticulocyte translation system from Promega and [35S]Met (1200 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) was used for cell-free translations. The in vitro transcribed FWA was heated at 67°C for 10 min and ihen added to the translation mixture. A TCA protein precipitation assay was used to determine the amount of radioactivity incorporated into proteins. The translation reaction mixture (50 pL) was gently vortexed prior to removing a 2-pL aliquot to be analyzed for incorporation (Table I). Enzyme Assays The biosynthesis of inositol was assayed by the end product method (Chen and Charalampous, 1966). ~ 4 1 -  ''C]Glc-6-P (specific activity 60.3 mCi/mmol) and [1,2- 3H]myo-inositol (specific activity 370-740 GBq/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. Glc-6-P and bacterial alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Paper Chromatography Paper chromatography (Trevelyan, 1950) was used to detect inositol synthesized using the labeled substrate ~-[1- ''C]Glc-6-P. Samples were concentrated to a volume of 25 pL, spotted on Whatman No. 1 paper (10 X 10 inches), and chromatographed for 12 h in an ascending, one-dimen- sional system with either acetone:water (85:15, v/v) or propano1:pyridine:water (3: 1 : 1, v/v). [ 1 -14C]Glc-6-P and [1,2-3Hlmyo-inositol were used as standards.

Water was used as the mobile phase. Waters differential refrac- tometer (R401) and a baseline 810 chromatography work- station were used to detect the peaks. A11 compounds were dissolved in 160 mg of ethanol (interna1 standard) and 4 mL of water (Waters Dextro-Pak Cartridge manual). Solu- tions (20 pL of standards and products of the enzyme assays) were injected to give about 80% full-scale deflection on the R401 refractive index detector. A baseline 810 com- puter program was used to analyze and label the curves. The differential refractometer (R401) provided a single- beam optics path that rejected noise and other baseline instabilities. RESULTS lsolation of an AIS cDNA Clone The inositol-requiring strain inol-13, trpl ,  his3, leu2, uru3 was transformed with an Arubidopsis cDNA (A Yes) expres- sion library. The plasmid portion of the A Yes vector can be looped out of the A phage by site-specific recombination using the Cre protein and lox sites in the vector (Elledge et al., 1991). Depending on its orientation, the cDNA inserted into this vector can either be expressed from the yeast gu11 promoter or the E.  coli lar promoter. Transformants were selected sequentially, using uracil and then inositol proto- trophy to avoid the possibility of "inositol-less death" (Culbertson et al., 1976). Two thousand uracil prototrophic transformants were screened for inositol prototrophy. The clones were grown on yeast medium without inositol and supplemented with either Gal or Glc. Ten colonies identi- fied as prototrophs for inositol in the presence of Gal only (prototrophy was repressed in the presence of Glc) were retained for further analyses. The plasmid extracted from each yeast colony was amplified in E. coli and reisolated. The reisolated plasmid was again used to transform the inositol-requiring yeast strain. Transformants from each plasmid regained uracil and inositol prototrophy simulta- neously, confirming that both functions were transferred with the plasmid. Restriction enzyme maps of the 10 plas- mids showed that they were a11 identical (Fig. 1). Cenomic D N A  Analysis To determine the sequences related to the AIS clone in the Arubidopsis genome, total genomic DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blot analysis. A radiolabeled single-stranded RNA probe was produced from the 1.9-kb insert (Fig. 1). Arubidopsis genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII at high stringency resulted in two bands (Fig. 2). At a lower stringency less intense bands could be seen that disappeared when the blot was washed at high stringency (data not shown).  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Southern blot analysis of Arabidopsis genomic DNA di-gested with fcoRI (lane 1) or H/ndlll (lane 2) and probed with the1.9-kb insert (Fig. 1).In Vitro Synthesized RNA and ProteinIntact RNA transcripts were generated in vitro for tran-scriptional and translational studies of the AIS clone. Afterrestriction enzyme digestion to linearize the plasmid, thecoding strand (as defined by northern analysis) of the AISclone was transcribed using the T7 promoter of the pBlue-script II KS~ vector (Fig. 1). The transcripts were cappedwith a 5' cap structure. The presence of the cap structurehas been shown to enhance the translation efficiency ofRNA transcripts both by rabbit reticulocyte lysate and bymicroinjected Xenopus oocytes (Berridge and Lane, 1976).SDS polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3) and western analyses (datanot shown) established that the protein derived from the T7transcript was recognized by the yeast antibody and has amol wt (approximately 52,000) similar to that of the Arabi-dopsis native protein. Sequence analysis showed that theactual mol wt of the protein was 52,541 (Johnson, 1994).The yeast MI-l-P synthase has a mol wt of 62,842 (Johnsonand Henry, 1989).Enzyme AssaysHaving verified that the protein expressed by the AISclone could indeed cross-react with the yeast antibody, wenext tested the expressed protein for its ability to convert14C-labeled and unlabeled Glc-6-P to inositol 1-P. The en-zyme assay was modified in that the reaction was per-1 2 3RISFigure 3. SDS-PACE of in vitro translated proteins.

The reaction product, labeled andunlabeled inositol monophosphate, was converted to freemyo-inositol by treatment with bacterial alkaline phos-phatase. Barium hydroxide was used to hydrolyze Glc. Thelabeled [14C]inositol resulting from the conversion of[!14C]Glc-6-P was identified by paper chromatographytwice, using a different solvent system each time. The firstchromatogram (Fig. 4) reflected an acetone and water (85:15) solvent system. The solvent for the second run con-sisted of propanol:pyridine:water (3:1:1). The RF valuesfrom these runs were comparable to those reported byCulbertson et al. (1976). [l-14C]Glc-6-P and [l,2-3H]inositolwere used as standards (Fig. 4). The resulting chromato-gram (Fig. 4, lane 2) shows that inositol was only producedin the translation reaction mixture containing protein pro-duced from the T7 transcript of the AIS clone.HPLC AnalysisHPLC provided a more sensitive means of detectinginositol than did paper chromatography. The in vitro syn-thesized proteins (Table I) were tested for their ability toconvert unlabeled Glc-6-P to inositol 1-P. Inositol was pro-duced only by the protein translated from the T7 transcriptof the AIS clone (Fig. 5C, peak 2). These results confirmedthose obtained using paper chromatography. Although re-sidual Glc was removed when barium hydroxide wasadded to the reaction mixture, the samples were also run asmixtures of the inositol and Glc standards, since there waslittle difference between the retention times of inositol(2.450 min) and Glc (2.617 min) using this system.Inositol Regulates the Expression of AISBecause the enzymatic activity of MI-l-P synthase hasbeen shown to be repressed by the presence of inositol inplants, animals (Loewus and Loewus, 1983), and yeast(Culbertson et al., 1976), we asked whether the ArabidopsisMI-l-P synthase is also regulated in response to inositol.f9IC-6-PInosltolFigure 4.

RNA and proteins were isolated. Northern anal-ysis of the mRNA isolated from these seedlings showedthat inositol regulates the expression of its MI-l-P synthase.The isolated Arabidopsis cDNA detected a 1.9-kb mRNAfrom seedlings grown in the absence or low concentrations[controlFigure 6. Northern blot analysis. mRNA (10 /xg) was isolated fromArabidopsis seedlings grown in the absence (lane 1) and presence ofincreasing concentrations of inositol: 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mM(lanes 2-6, respectively). When the AIS clone is used as a probe, a1.9-kb message is detected in seedlings grown in the absence (lane 1)but not in the presence of inositol concentrations of 50 mM or greater(lanes 3-6). A labeled probe to residual 28S rRNA was used as aloading control (marked control).of inositol (Fig. 6). The 1.9-kb mRNA was not detected inseedlings grown in inositol concentrations of 50 mM ormore (Fig. 6). Although northern blot analysis could detectsome 1.9-kb message in seedlings grown in 25 mM inositol,western blot analysis could not detect the protein (Fig. 7).DISCUSSIONWe began our studies of the regulation of inositol bio-synthesis and metabolism by isolating and studying a genethat encodes the biosynthetic enzyme MI-l-P synthase. Theenzyme is known to catalyze a complex series of reactionsthat involve at least three partial reactions (Loewus, 1990).A mechanism based on experimental observations has beenproposed (Sherman et al., 1977; Wong and Sherman, 1985).The identity of an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding MI-l-Psynthase was established using a combination of genetic,biochemical, and molecular analyses. The gene was iso-lated by genetic complementation of a yeast inol mutation.In vitro transcription and translation of the gene produceda protein that can convert Glc-6-P to inositol monophos-phate. This protein is also recognized by yeast anti-MI-1-Psynthase antiserum. The calculated molecular mass of theprotein as measured by its migration in SDS polyacryl-amide gels is approximately 52.0 kD (Fig. 7). Compared toanimal and yeast sources, the reported molecular weightsfor MI-l-P synthase have been lower for plants (Loewusand Loewus, 1983). Western and northern analyses of pro-teins and mRNA isolated from A. thaliana seedlings grownaseptically in the presence and absence of inositol indicatethat inositol has a regulatory role (at the transcriptionallevel) in the expression of MI-l-P synthase. Expression ofthe enzyme is repressed by the presence of inositol inconcentrations of 50 mM or more. Others have also shownthat the expression of MI-l-P synthase in plants (Acer pseu-doplatanus cell culture) is repressed in the presence of in-ositol (Loewus and Loewus, 1983). In animal systems, in-vestigators have shown that there is selective hormonalcontrol of inositol biosynthesis in reproductive organs andliver of the male rat (Hasegawa and Eisenberg, 1981). MI-l-P synthase is regulated both in response to exogenousinositol and to unlinked regulatory genes in yeast (Culbert-1 4 5 6 7Veast - »~Hrabidopsis - *-Figure 7.

Comparison of the pr imary structure of the Arubidopsis synthase to  other proteins found in data  banks revealed that the primary structure of MI-1-P synthase, thus  far, is highly conserved (Johnson and Henry, 1989; Smart a n d  Fleming, 1993; Johnson, 1994). The primary structure of a Phaseolus vulgaris MI-1-P synthase has recently been added to the  data  banks (M.D. Johnson and X. Wang, unpublished results). It will be of great interest t o  determine whether the active sites of the enzyme have been evolutionarily conserved. Studies of the  regulation and subcellular localization of MI-1-P synthase dur ing  embryonic and postembryonic de- velopment in Arubidopsis (M.D. Johnson and K. Lackey, unpublished results) and Pkuseolus (M.D. Johnson and X. Wang, unpublished results) are  currently under way. Ex- pression of the enzyme is temporally and spatially regu- lated. W e  hope to define, genetically, inositol's role in these developmental processes by isolating and characterizing mutants  in Arabidopsis that lack a functioning MI-1-P syn- thase and oxygenase. Crucial to our studies of the genetic regulation of inositol biosynthesis and metabolism in higher plants, however, is a molecular analysis of the  organization of the locus that  encodes MI-1-P synthase. W e  are  currently addressing this question.
