Parasitic plants are defined as vascular plants that have de-veloped specialized organs for the penetration of the tissuesof other vascular plants (hosts) and the establishment of con-nections to the vascular strands of the host for the absorptionof nutrients by the parasite. Parasitic plants are commonly di-vided into holoparasites that lack chlorophyll, do not carryout photosynthesis, and absorb organic matter from the hosts,and hemiparasites that are green, capable of photosynthesis,and absorb mainly inorganic nutrients from hosts. From an-cient times, a number of parasitic plants have been widelyused as traditional medicines in China. For the purpose ofunderstanding the unusual secondary metabolism in parasiticplants and elucidating the pharmacologically active con-stituents of traditional Chinese medicines derived from para-sitic plants, we initiated studies of the chemical constituentsof Cynomorium songaricum RUPR. (Cynomoriaceae). C.songaricum belongs is an achlorophyllous holoparasite thatis distributed in the northwestern part of China. Its stems areused as tonics and for the treatment of kidney disorders.1)Among its chemical constituents, steroids, triterpenes,2) fruc-tosides,3) flavanoids, and condensed tannins4) have been re-ported previously. This paper deals with the structural eluci-dation of two new phenolic compounds (1 and 2) isolatedfrom the stems of C. songaricum and their chemotaxonomicsignificance.Results and DiscussionMeOH extracts and 70% aqueous acetone extracts of thestems of C. songaricum were combined and subjected to par-tition between the EtOAc and H2O layers. The H2O layer andEtOAc layer were individually fractionated and purified by acombination of column chromatographies as described in theExperimental Methods section. Compounds 1 and 2, togetherwith nicoloside,5) gallic acid, phloridzin,4) and rutin were iso-lated from the H2O layer. Methyl protocatechuicate, p-hy-droxy benzoic acid, and (2) catechin were obtained from theEtOAc layer. The known compounds were identified by com-parison with authentic samples or reported spectral and phys-ical data.Compound 1, a pale yellow amorphous powder, showed an[M1Na]1 and [M1H]1 ion peak at m/z 545 and 523, respec-tively, in the positive FAB-MS spectrum, which correspondsto the molecular formula C26H34O11, together with carbonsignals in the 13C-NMR spectrum. The 1H-NMR spectrum of1 showed signals due to two methoxyl groups [dH 3.76, 3.53(each 3H, s)], an anomeric proton of sugar [dH 5.51 (1H, d,J57 Hz)], 1,3,4-trisubstituted [dH 7.02 (1H, d, J52 Hz), 7.01(1H, d, J58), 6.86 (1H, dd, J52, 8 Hz)], and 1,3,4,6-tetra-substituted [dH 7.09 (1H, s), 6.90 (1H, s)] benzene rings. Inthe 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 1), signals arising from a glu-copyranose moiety, two aromatic nuclei, and six aliphaticcarbons along with two methoxyl groups were observed, sug-gesting that the aglycone of 1 is a lignan. Enzymatic hydroly-sis of 1 by cellulasefurnished (2)-isolariciresinol (1a) ([a ]D15234.6°, acetone)6) and D-glucose [[a ]D20 127.6° (H2O)], con-firmed that 1 is a glucopyranoside of 1a. When downfieldshifts of C-1 and C-4 of 1 were compared with those of 1a(Table 1), they indicated a glycosidic linkage at the C-4 hy-droxyl group. The anomeric configuration of glucopyranosewas determined to be b from the 3JH1,H2 value (7 Hz). The ab-solute configuration of C-79 of 1 was further established tobe R, since a positive Cotton effect at 291 nm7) was observedin the CD spectrum. Thus compound 1 was determined to be(2)-isolariciresinol 4-O-b-D-glucopyranoside.1036 Notes Chem. Pharm.

Received February 28, 2001; accepted April 21, 2001Eight phenolic compounds including two new lignan glucopyranosides together with a known alkaloid wereisolated from the stems of Cynomorium songaricum RUPR. (Cynomoriaceae). Their chemical structures were elu-cidated on the basis of spectral and chemical evidence. The chemotaxonomic significance of these metabolites isdiscussed.Key words Cynomorium songaricum; Cynomoriaceae; parasitic plant; lignan; chemotaxonomyCompound 2 was isolated as a pale yellow amorphouspowder. Its positive FAB-MS spectrum exhibited an[M1Na]1 ion peak at m/z 543, indicating that the degree ofunsaturation of 2 is one greater than that of 1. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2, in addition to the signals arising fromtwo methoxyl groups, a b-glucopyranose moiety, 1,3,4-trisubstituted and 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ringswhich are similar to those of 1, two olefinic proton signals[dH 6.61 (1H, d, J516 Hz), 6.22 (1H, dt, J516, 6 Hz)] of atrans double-bond were observed. The presence of glucosewas also confirmed by acid hydrolysis of 2, followed bycochromatography with an authentic sample of glucose onhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 13C-NMRdata (Table 1) indicated that 2 is also a lignan glucopyra-noside. By carefully analyzing the 1H–1H shift correlationspectroscopy (COSY) and 13C-NMR spectrum, the aglyconeof 2 was determined to be dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol.8) Thecoupling constant (6 Hz) of H-7 and H-8 supported a transconfiguration between C-7 and C-8.9) Since H-99 signalsshifted downfield by 1.1 ppm compared with that of dehy-drodiconiferyl alcohol,8) the location of the glucose was es-tablished to be at the C-99 hydroxyl position. The absoluteconfiguration of the dihydrofuran ring was determined to be7S, 8R from the positive Cotton effect at 278 nm in the CDspectrum.9) On the basis of the above evidence, compound 2was determined to be (7S, 8R) dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 99-b-glucopyranoside.We have isolated eight henolic compounds, including twonew lignan glucopyranosides (1, 2), together with a knownalkaloid from the stems of C. songaricum, a parasitic medici-nal plant of the family Cynomoriaceae. In our ongoing stud-ies on the chemical constituents of parasitic medicinal plants,we have recently isolated compound 1 and a neolignan glu-copyranoside with the same dihydrobenzofuran skeleton ascompound 2 from Balanophora japonica (Balanophoraceae)(Jiang et al., unpublished data). Moreover, phloridzin, a dihy-drochalcone glucoside, has been also reported from a Bal-anophora plant.10) This chemical evidence suggests thatCynomoriaceae is taxonomically related to Balanophoraceae.The polyphenolic constituents of Balanophora will be re-ported in the near future.Experimental Methods1H- (500 and 300 MHz) and 13C- (125 MHz and 75 MHz) NMR: VarianUNITY plus 500 and Varian GEMINI 300 spectrometers with tetramethylsi-lane (TMS) as the internal standard.
