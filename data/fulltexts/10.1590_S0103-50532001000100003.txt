Cinco glicosídeos foram isolados a partir das folhas de P. alata. Após extensivas análises
espectroscópicas, as estruturas 1-5 foram identificadas como sendo o 3-O-β-D-glicopiranosil-
estigmasterol (1), o ácido 3-O-β-D-glicopiranosil-oleanólico (2), o ácido 3-O-β-D-glicopiranosil-
(1→3)-β-D-glicopiranosil-oleanólico (3), o ácido 3-O-β-D- glicopiranosil-(1→2)-β-D-glicopiranosil-
oleanólico (4) e 9,19-ciclolanost-24Z-en-3β,21,26-tri-hidróxi-3,26-di-O-gentiobiose (5).
Adicionalmente, foram analisados, através de CCD, extratos hidroetanólicos de espécies de Passiflora
existentes no sul do Brasil (P. actinia, P. caerulea, P. edulis var. flavicarpa, P. elegans, P. foetida, P.
misera e P. tenuifila). A acumulação de saponinas foi verificada somente em Passiflora alata.
Five glycosides were isolated from leaves of P. alata. The structures 1-5 were obtained through
extensive spectral analyses as 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-stigmasterol (1), 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-
oleanolic acid (2), 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-oleanolic acid (3), 3-O-
β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-oleanolic acid (4) and 9,19-cyclolanost-24Z-en-
3β,21,26-trihydroxy-3,26-di-O-gentiobiose (5). Comparison of the TLC profiles of the
hydroethanolic extracts from leaves of other Passiflora species found in the south of Brazil
(P. actinia, P. caerulea, P. edulis var. flavicarpa, P. elegans, P. foetida, P. misera and P. tenuifila)
showed that only P. alata presented saponin accumulation.

Introduction
Passion fruits that are nowadays grown throughout the
tropics are native to Latin America and Brazil is the leading
exporter of passion fruit juice1. Additionally to this alimen-
tary function as flavor and as juice in food industries, pas-
sionflower extract has an ancient tradition in the folk medi-
cine of American and even European countries due its re-
puted sedative and tranquilizing properties2.
Although Passiflora alata is an official drug of the Brazilian
Pharmacopoeia3 and its leaf extract is included as an active
component in many Brazilian registered pharma-ceutical
preparations4, there are only a few investigations on its chemical
components5 and pharmacological properties6,7.
In view of its pharmaceutical utilization, the knowledge
of the chemical components of P. alata is important for the
development of methods for the quality control of drug and
phytopharmaceutical preparations. Moreover, since it has
recently been shown that P. alata could induce respiratory
allergy8, quality control methods could be extended to ana-
lyze pretended hypoallergenic drugs or beverages contain-
ing passionflower extracts. Also, the phytochemical study of
P. alata is justified in view of searching for the still unknown
therapeutically active or allergenic substances.
This paper describes the isolation and structure elucida-
tion of one steroid glycoside (1) and four triterpene saponins
(2-5) from the leaves of P. alata. The use of these com-
pounds as natural markers is also discussed.
Experimental

1997. A herbarium specimen (ICN 8344) is on deposit in the
Herbarium of the Botany Department of the Universidade
Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil. Aerial
parts of native P. actinia Hooker, P. caerulea L., P. edulis Sims
var. flavicarpa, P. elegans Masters, P. foetida L., P. misera
H.B.K. and P. tenuifila Killip were collected in different cities
of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.
Extraction and isolation
Air-dried powdered leaves of P. alata (750 g) were ex-
tracted by maceration in EtOH (plant:solvent, 1:10, w/v)
(2 x 10 days). After evaporation of the ethanolic extract,
the gummy residue was suspended in H2O (500 mL) and
extracted successively (4 x 200 mL) with chloroform, ethyl
acetate and n-butanol. Evaporation of the n-butanol frac-
tion yielded the crude saponin fraction (26 g) whose a part
(12 g) was chromatographed on a Si gel column using
CHCl3:EtOH:AcOH (60:40:6, v/v) yielding pure 2 (7 mg),
fractions A (40 mg), B (95 mg), C (180 mg) and D (840
mg). Fraction A was, after usual peracetylation9, submit-
ted to preparative TLC [Si gel GF254, mobile phase
AcOEt:cyclohexane (1:1, v/v)] yielding 17 mg of
peracetylated 1 (1a) and 14 mg of peracetylated 2 (2a).
Fraction B yielded pure 3 by CC (15 mg) using n-
BuOH:AcOH:H2O (5:3:1, v/v) and, after peracetylation
and CC, peracetylated 3 (3a) (12 mg). Compound 4 (35
mg) was obtained from fraction C by precipitation. Com-
pound 5 (230 mg) was isolated from fraction D through
CC using n-BuOH saturated with H2O.
Chromatographic analysis
Analytical TLC aluminum sheets coated with Si gel
GF254 (Merck) were used. Air-dried powdered leaves of
Passiflora species were extracted, separately, by maceration
in EtOH (plant:solvent, 1:10, w/v) (2 x 10 days). After
evaporation of the ethanolic extracts, the gummy residues
were dissolved, separately, in MeOH for TLC comparison.
Saponins were analyzed using CHCl3:EtOH:AcOH
(60:40:6, v/v) as the mobile phase and the spots were
visualized by heating (100 °C) the anisaldehyde-H2SO4-
sprayed plates.
General
FAB-MS analysis were performed in positive mode
on a Kratos MS 80 instrument. NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. Compounds
2, 3 and 4 were hydrolyzed as described by Kartnig and
Wegschaider10 in order to analyze the aglycone and
sugar components.

Results and Discussion
The n-BuOH extract of P. alata was submitted to Si gel
CC to yield compounds 1-5 and their identification was
achieved through the combined use of mass and NMR
spectroscopy.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 1a displayed signals at δ 0.69
and 0.98 (s, 3 H each) for two tertiary methyl groups, two
doublets (3 H each) at δ  0.79 (J 7.0 Hz) and 0.84 (J 6.5 Hz)
assignable to an isopropyl group and the presence of another
secondary methyl at δ  1.01 (d, J 6.5 Hz, 3 H). A triplet
centered at δ  0.80 (J 7.0 Hz, 3 H) was attributed to a primary
Vol. 12 No. 1, 2001 Steroidal and Triterpenoidal Glucosides from Passiflora alata 35
methyl. These characteristic signals suggested a steroid
skeleton. Three olefinic proton signals at δ  5.35 (br, d, J 5.1
Hz), δ  5.15 (m) and at δ  5.05 (m) were attributed to H-6, H-
22 and H-23, respectively, and together with the signal at δ
3.49 (m, 1 H, Hα-3) they are characteristic for ∆5,22-3β-
hydroxysterols12,13,14. Comparison of 13C NMR spectrum
(Table 1) and the 2D-HSQC spectrum with spectral data of
related sterols found in the literature indicated that compound
1 is the sterol glycoside 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-
stigmasterol isolated as a peracetylated derivative. Its
occurrence in nature has only been reported several times
although the aglycone is widely found.
Acid hydrolysis of 2, 3 and 4 furnished oleanolic acid
and glucose (Glc). Both were identified through co-TLC
with authentic samples.
The FAB-MS (positive ion mode) spectrum of 2
indicated the molecular mass 618 due to the quasi-
molecular ion peak at m/z 641 (M+Na)+. In addition, there
were two characteristic peaks at m/z 203 and 248 denoting
the retro-Diels-Alder fragmentation commonly found in
the spectra of oleanane or ursane derivatives15. Careful
comparison of the 13C NMR data of peracetylated
compound 2a (Table 1) with those of peracetylated
dumosasaponin 69, allowed the unambiguous assignment
of the signals of the oleanolic acid aglycone. The presence
of one β-D-Glc was evidenced through the anomeric
signal at δc 102.9 (δH 4.55, d; J 8.0 Hz, 1 H) and the
sugar substitution at C-3 of the aglycone was established
(δ  C-3 90.5). These conclusions were confirmed by 1H-
1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY and ROESY experiments.
Therefore, compound 2 was identified as 3-O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl-oleanolic acid, already isolated from
Chenopodium quinoa16.
For compound 3 the molecular formula C42H68O13 was
deduced based on the FAB-MS spectrum, which displayed
a pseudo-molecular ion peak at m/z 803 (M+Na)+ and it
also showed fragments at m/z 203 and m/z 248. Detailed
comparison of 13C NMR data of 3a and 2a showed that 3a
structurally differs from 2a only by the presence of signals
for another hexose. Thus, as in the case of 2a, compound
3a presented a free carboxyl group at position C-28 while
a Glc,Glc-constituted disaccharide was substituted at C-3.
Considering the sugar carbon chemical shifts, the
correlation experiments (1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY) and
literature data, we could identify 3a as the peracetylated
derivative of 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-gluco-
pyranosyl-oleanolic acid, an already known saponin11.
The great similarity of the 13C NMR spectrum of 4
with that of 3a (Table 1) showed that 4 was also a derivative
of oleanolic acid with two Glc residues substituted at carbon
3. The FAB-MS spectrum of 4 exhibited a peak at m/z 803
(M+Na)+ and was consistent with the presence of these
two Glc residues. The interglycosidic linkage of this
disaccharide was deduced to be Glc(1→2)Glc from the
deshielding in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4 of one of the
CH units of this moiety (δ 83.4). Thus, 4 was determined
to be 3-O-β-D-gluco-pyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-gluco-
pyranosyl-oleanolic acid, already isolated from Passiflora
quadrangularis17 and Luffa acutangula18.
The most singular feature of 5 is the presence of two
upfield shifted signals at δ  0.20 and 0.45 in the 1H NMR
spectrum which are characteristic of geminal cyclopropane
protons. It also displayed signals corresponding to five me-
thyl singulets (δ  0.9, 1.03, 1.07, 1.27, 1.93) and one olefinic
proton at δ  5.52 (t, J 6.8 Hz) together with four anomeric
protons (δ  4.82, 4.89, 5.10 and 5.15). These data, in accor-

dance with 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), suggested a
cycloartane triterpene skeleton. 1H-1H COSY and 1H-13C
COSY experiments showed the presence of two gentiobioses
located at positions C-3 and C-26. Through detailed com-
parison of these data with those from the literature, 5 was
identified as 9,19-cyclolanostan-24Z-en-3β,21,26-trihy-
droxy-3,26-di-O-gentiobiose, already isolated from
Passiflora quadrangularis19 and named quadranguloside.
This study allowed us to identify five glycosides from
the leaves of P. alata. Although none of them are specific
to P. alata, their association in a single plant is unique, so
we wonder if we could use them as a phytochemical tracer
to either authentify the exclusive use of P. alata in phar-
maceutical preparations, or to certify the lack of P. alata in
therapeutic preparations elaborated from other passion-
flower species. Furthermore, the TLC profiles of the
hydroethanol extracts from the leaves of Passiflora spe-
cies found in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (south of Bra-
zil), P. actinia, P. alata, P. caerulea, P. edulis var. flavicarpa,
P. elegans, P. foetida, P. misera and P. tenuifila showed
accumulation of saponins only in P. alata. As far as we
know, saponins have only been reported for P.
quadrangularis L.17,19 and P. edulis Sims20.
Since secondary metabolite content can vary as a
function of multiple factors (such as environmental
conditions and harvest period), reproduction of this analysis
over a long period of time is of course needed before the
effectiveness of our method is totally demonstrated. We
are currently pursuing this goal.
