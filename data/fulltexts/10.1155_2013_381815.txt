In addition, it helps to decrease serum levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and uric acid, as wellas insulin resistance, and reduces cytokine levels. However its potential anti-inflammatory effect is unknown. We examined theeffects of alliin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by RT-PCR, Western blot, and microarrays analysisof 22,000 genes. Incubation of cells for 24 h with 100𝜇mol/L alliin prevented the increase in the expression of proinflammatorygenes, IL-6, MCP-1, and Egr-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to 100 ng/mL LPS for 1 h. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2,which is involved in LPS-induced inflammation in adipocytes, was decreased following alliin treatment. Furthermore, the geneexpression profile by microarrays evidentiate an upregulation of genes involved in immune response and downregulation of genesrelated with cancer. The present results have shown that alliin is able to suppress the LPS inflammatory signals by generating ananti-inflammatory gene expression profile and by modifying adipocyte metabolic profile.1. IntroductionObesity has been traditionally linked to metabolic dysfunc-tion, led by adipocyte proliferation and hypertrophy [1].However, some other systemic alterations are being studiedas related to obesity, for example, inflammation and immunedysfunction [2]. Adipose tissue is now widely considered asan endocrine tissue capable of producing chronic inflamma-tory responses [3–5]. Obesity has been shown to cause anincrease in plasma concentrations of a number of proinflam-matory markers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-𝛼) that are expressed andreleased by adipocytes [6]. Diet-induced obesity increaseslocal and systemic inflammatory adipocytokines in humansand in rodents; these factors contribute to adverse health out-comes [7]. The homeostatic balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines defines the profileand magnitude of inflammation and its effects on insulinsensitivity and glucose homeostasis [8]. Therefore, therapiesable to modulate the inflammatory state of adipose tissue arebeing considered for the treatment of obesity [9]. However,factors that might mitigate or act against this inflammatoryresponse have remained elusive.Garlic (Allium sativum) is one of the oldest medicinalplants used by different cultures [10].

However, its anti-inflammatory effects have receivedless attention. For example, garlic compounds can exert ananti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the oxidative stress-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-𝜅B) [14],which is implicated in the expression of proinflammatoryenzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS)and cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II). In particular, allicin andajoene, two garlic compounds, significantly suppressed nitricoxide production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation,accompanied by suppression in inducible nitric oxide (iNOS)expression and iNOS activity [15]. Although it appearspromising that garlic and its derivatives possess antidiabeticpotential, an understanding of the antidiabetic effects of garlicis still in its early stages. Furthermore, the active compoundsin garlic, and doses thereof, which can effectively provideantidiabetic effects (i.e., glycemic control and amelioration ofdiabetic complications) remain to be established.Alliin (S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide), first identified by Stolland Seebeck in 1947, is considered the main specific principleof garlic since that time [16]. Alliin can be found in intactgarlic and its reduced form; S-allyl-cysteine is the majorcomponent of aged garlic extract (AGE), together with otherderived organosulfur compounds [12, 13]. It is absorbed inthe intestine via the amino acid transported for cysteine [17],exhibits an hypoglycemic effect, and also increases bloodinsulin concentrations [18], and its antioxidant activity hasbeen widely studied [19]. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, itsanti-inflammatory potential has not yet been explored.Mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells are the most commonlystudied and available adipogenic cell line. This cell linehas been quite useful in identifying key molecular mark-ers, transcription factors, and various interactions that arerequired for preadipocyte differentiation [20]. Additionally,3T3-L1 adipocytes are able to respond to LPS by meansof a fully intact innate immunity pathway, through theproduction and secretion of immunomodulatory (mainlyproinflammatory) molecules such as IL-6, TNF-𝛼, and TLR-2 [21], and through a TLR-ligand-induced activation, whichtriggers a proinflammatory and -diabetic transformation ofadipocytes [22]. Interestingly, this immune response activa-tion is resembled by human adipose tissue [23]; consequently,once differentiated, 3T3-L1 appears to be a suitable model totest the anti-inflammatory response that affects themetabolicregulation of adipocytes elicited by chemical compoundsand nutraceutics under controlled conditions [24–27]. Thus,to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of alliin, in thepresent work we used the LPS-stimulated 3T3-L1 cell lineas an inflammatory model in vitro. Our findings indicatethat alliin prevents LPS-induced inflammation by inhibitingERK1/2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Culture. 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from AmericanType Culture Collection (ATCCCL-173) and cultured at 37∘Cin 5% CO2/95% humidified air. The cells were maintainedin Dulbecco’s Eagle modified medium (DMEM) with 25mMHEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (100U/mL; 100 𝜇g/mL),and 10% calf serum. The cells were differentiated 2 days afterconfluence (day 0) in DMEM containing 10% Fetal bovineserum (FBS), 0.25 𝜇M dexamethasone, 0.5mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 5 𝜇g/mL insulin for 48 h; the cells werethen incubated in 10% FBS/DMEM with insulin for 72 h.Finally 10% FBS/DMEM was changed every 2 days.2.2. T3-L1 Cell Treatment. On day 8 after differentiation, thecells were pretreated during a 24 h periodwith amediumcon-taining 0.1mM alliin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were thenincubatedwith the samemediumalongwith LPS (100 ng/mL)for 1 h before being harvested. The cultured medium wascollected in tubes and stored at −80∘C. Preliminary exper-iments were performed to determine the concentrations ofalliin during time-course experiments (data not shown).2.3. mRNA Expression Quantification by qPCR. Total RNAwas isolated from cells by using the Ultraspec reagent(Biotecx, Houston, TX, USA). First-strand cDNA wasreverse-transcribed from 0.5 𝜇g of total RNA by employingtheM-MLVReverse Transcriptase protocol (Invitrogen).ThecDNA was amplified with different pairs of specific primersthat were designed utilizing PrimerExpress software (Table 1).Mediators of Inflammation 3The real-time quantitative PCR reaction contained0.2 𝜇g/𝜇L of reverse-transcribed total RNA, 18 𝜇M for-ward and reverse primers, and 10𝜇L of iQ SYBR GreenSuperMix (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed in 48-wellplates with the MiniOpticon real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed by the compara-tive cycle of threshold method, with the invariable adeninephosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) gene used for normal-ization.2.4. Protein Analysis by Western Blotting. To obtain totalprotein from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells from different treat-ments were homogenized in 50𝜇L RIPA buffer at 4∘Csupplemented with 10mM sodium orthovanadate, 100mMPMSF, and 5.4mg/mL aprotinin. Insoluble material wasremoved by centrifugation for 30min at 13,500 g at 4∘C.The protein concentration of the supernatants was deter-mined by the Bradford method. Proteins were denaturedby boiling (5min); then 30 𝜇g were resolved by SDS-PAGEon 10% separation gels and transferred to immobilon PVDFmembranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Nonspecificprotein binding to the PVDF membrane was reduced bypreincubation for 1 h at 22∘C in TBS tween-20 (0.1%) and5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer. The PVDFmembranes were incubated overnight at 4∘C with mono-clonal antibodies against total and phosphorylated ERK1/2(Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,CA, USA), which were diluted 1 : 1,000 in blocking buffer.After incubation, themembraneswerewashed for 5min threetimes in TBS tween-20 (0.1%). The blots were subsequentlyincubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodyfor 1 h at 22∘C in TBS tween-20 (0.1%) and 5% (w/v) fat-free milk. For evaluation of protein loading, the membraneswere incubated and reblotted with anti-𝛽-actin antibody(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as appropriate. Specific bandswere detected using the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence kit(Amersham), and visualization/capture was performed byexposure of themembranes toRXfilms. Band intensitieswerequantified by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).2.5. Analysis of Cytokine Levels by Enzyme-Linked Immun-osorbent Assays (ELISA). Cytokines and chemokines weremeasured in cell culture supernatants using ELISA tech-niques (Bio-Plex Pro Assays; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).Thelower detection limit was 38 pg/mL for IL-6, 21 pg/mL forTNF-𝛼, and 51 pg/mL for MCP-1. For data normalizationand to exclude artificial effects of different cell densities,total protein concentration was measured for each well, andsupernatant cytokine concentrations were divided by proteinconcentration. Each sample was measured in triplicate byELISA. Values were expressed as mean ± standard error ofthemean (SEM) (𝑛 = 6wells were used for each experimentalgroup).2.6. Printing of Arrays, Probe Preparation, and Hybridizationof Arrays. A Mus musculus 22,000 65-mer Oligo Libraryfrom Sigma-Genosys sets was used. For the hybridizationexperiments, the RNA utilized was from cells collected fromcultures. For cDNA synthesis, 10 𝜇g of total RNA was usedas the template, incorporating dUTP-Cy3 or dUTP-Cy5, andequal quantities of labeled cDNA were hybridized to the22,000 oligo mouse arrays, as described previously [28, 29].2.7. Data Acquisition and Analysis of Array Images. Acquisi-tion and quantification of the array images were performedin a ScanArray 4000 apparatus using the accompanyingsoftware ScanArray 4000 (Packard BioChips; Perkin-Elmer,MN, USA). All images were captured as described previously[28, 29]. In all cases, the fluorescence signal was from sevento ten times more intensive than the background signal, andthe background evaluationwas always evaluated immediatelybeside the labeled spot.2.8. Data Analysis. Microarray data analysis was performedusingGenArise free software.The goal of GenArise is to iden-tify genes that are good candidates for differential expressionby calculating an intensity-dependent 𝑧-score, successfullyused and recently reported [28, 29]. Applying these criteria,the elements with a 𝑧-score of >2 standard deviations (SD)are genes likely to be differentially expressed.2.9. Statistical Analysis. The results are expressed as themean± SEM. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism softwarewas employed and the one-way ANOVA test was applied tocompare the treatment effects. Significant differences wereestablished by the Turkey-Kramer test. Values of 𝑃 < 0.05were considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. Alliin Pretreatment Significantly Reduces the mRNAExpression and Protein Levels of Proinflammatory MoleculesIL-6 and MCP-1 after LPS Exposure in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.Previously, we determined the alliin concentration that exertsan effect on the expression of the tested genes; the concentra-tions probed were 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0mM (data not shown).From this we selected 0.1mM as the minimum concentrationable to elicit a clear effect.Cytokine IL-6 is correlated with insulin resistance insubjects with obesity and is inducible throughTLR-4 receptoractivation [30]. After the alliin pretreatment, mRNA levelsfor IL-6 were significantly reduced (Figure 1(a)). In contrast,the level of TNF-𝛼 mRNA was apparently not significantlyaffected, although a slight tendency toward its decrease inalliin pretreated cells was also noted (Figure 1(b)).Additionally, we checked for MCP-1 expression becauseit is produced by a variety of cells, including adipocytes, inresponse to inflammatory stimuli [31]. As expected, we founda significant increase in MCP-1 expression in LPS-treatedadipocytes. Interestingly, we again observed a significantreduction in MCP-1 mRNA levels when LPS-stimulatedadipocytes were pretreated with alliin (Figure 1(c)).Furthermore, we verified the expression of Egr-1, whichis described as induced by cytokines and hormones throughactivation of the MAPK pathway and which are related withinsulin resistance [32].

Protein levels detected afterthe LPS stimulus, which are significantly reduced by alliinpretreatment, are shown in the case of IL-6 (Figure 2(a))and Mcp-1 (Figure 2(d)). Moreover, we observed a reductionin TNF-𝛼 levels (Figure 2(b)), although this was small anddid not reach statistical significance. Additionally, we testedfor adiponectin levels (Figure 2(c)) because this representsan important union between obesity and insulin resistanceand is considered as an anti-inflammatory protein [33].The control group of adipocytes secretes a large amount ofadiponectin (Figure 2(c)), which is clearly reduced by LPSstimuli. In the group pretreated with alliin, a slight increasecan be observed in the production of this protein; however, itcannot overcome the severe reduction elicited by LPS.3.2. Alliin Exerts Its Anti-Inflammatory Effect at Leastthrough Diminishing the Phosphorylation of ERK1/2. SinceLPS induces inflammation in adipocytes through ERK1/2[30] and IL-6 and Egr-1 intracellular signaling mechanismsconverge in this pathway, we next examined whether alliinpretreatment affects ERK1/2 phosphorylation. LPS stimulus isable to increase the protein levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2,and alliin pretreatment overwhelms this effect by significantlyreducing this level, to nearly reach control levels (Figures 3(a)and 3(b)).3.3.

After analysis of the microarrays byGeneArise software, we found that of a total of the 22,000genes analyzed in themicroarrays, a total of 2,426 genes (11%)modify their expression, with a 𝑧-score between 2 and 6.2 inat least one of the three comparisons performed, which werethe following: control versus LPS; control versus alliin + LPS,and LPS versus alliin + LPS. The remainder did not exhibitsignificant variations in expression, obtaining a 𝑧-score of<±2.0.Comparison versus control group (nonstimulated adipo-cytes), LPS treatment, with or without alliin pretreatment,clearly modifies the expression of 315 genes (upregulating 255and downregulating 60 genes) in common between the twocomparisons (control versus LPS and control versus alliin +LPS). When analyzed by DAVID software [34] at high astrin-gency, 237 of 315 (75%) correspond to identified genes, whichcan be grouped into 64 gene clusters according to functionalcluster analysis. This profile is totally consistent with dozensof previous reports regarding the effect of LPS on the geneexpression of numerous genes. The clusters that reach anenrichment score of >1.5 according to DAVID analysis [34],as well as representative genes whose expression is signifi-cantly modified by LPS in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes,independently of the alliin pretreatment can be consultedin Table 1-SM (See Table 1-SM in Supplementary Mate-rial available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/381815).Therefore, as a first conclusion, the 315 genes detected hereas modified by LPS confirms the effect of LPS and alsoenlarges the panorama concerning the effect of LPS ondifferentiated adipocytes in vitro, including several new geneswhose mRNA expression are most probably affected by LPSproinflammatory stimuli.On the other hand, we found 2,108 genes that weremodified by alliin action after proinflammatory LPS stimuli.Of these, a subgroup of 125 genes was modified in at leasttwo of the comparisons performed (54 were upregulated and71 were downregulated with a 𝑧-score > 2.0); thus we canconsider these genes as thosewhose expression ismodified byalliin pretreatment. When analyzed by DAVID software [34]at high astringency, 100 of these genes were identified (80%)and grouped into 23 functional clusters. These functionalclusters can be regrouped into nine functional categories byobvious similarities in cluster function.Data can be consultedin Table 2-SM.Based on previous works [28, 29], we further conducteda more detailed analysis of the genes that reach a median𝑧-score of >2.5 (up- or downregulated) between two groupcomparisons. We propose that genes fitting these criteria arethose with greatest relevance and whose expression level ismodified by alliin pretreatment in response to proinflamma-tory stimuli. All of the genes that were modified by alliinpretreatment in a sole comparison or with a median 𝑧-scoreof between 2.0 and 2.5 were excluded from this analysis.Withthis high-stringency criteria, we obtain 28 genes upregulatedby alliin and 35 that were downregulated (full results canbe consulted in Tables 3-SM and 4-SM). When individualanalyses were performed, among the upregulated genes, wefound that the most relevant group included 10 genes (36%)and is related with immunoglobulin and the T-cell receptor.The second relevant group includes eight genes than encodefor different enzymes, and finally there was a third groupof eight diverse genes and two additional unidentified genes(Table 2). Among the genes downregulated by alliin, weidentified amain group that includes 15 genes that are cancer-related (Table 3), in addition to a group of five genes thatencodes for enzymes, and a third group of seven genes relatedwith diverse functions. It is noteworthy that a fourth groupincludes 10 unknown genes, which represent 29% of genesdownregulated by alliin.Thus, we present here the gene expression profile elicitedafter LPS stimuli when adipocytes receive an alliin pretreat-ment.These results provide large and clear evidence support-ing alliin action, which clearly reverses the proinflammatoryeffect of LPS, as well as performing other parallel effects,because there is a clear shift in the gene expression profile.4. DiscussionBecause obesity is the result of a complex combination ofmultiple genetic and environmental factors, the consumptionof certain nutraceuticals, such as garlic components, insteadof or even in addition to highly energetic, fatty, and palatablefoods, is able to modulate the metabolic functioning ofadipose tissue in a way that results in the attenuation of theMediators of Inflammation 7Table 3: Group analysis of genes that decrease their expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by alliin pretreatment and after LPS stimuli.Cancer related (15 genes—43%) Hoxb13, Hmg20b, Cxcl16, Uimc1, Elf1, Foxp1, Ptgdr, Psmd8, Peg3, Myo15, Lig1,Ptbp2, Kif2c, Grhpr, FahEnzymes (5 genes—14%) Dck, Zdhhc4, Pik3c2g, Grhpr, FahDiverse functions (7 genes—20%)Adipogenesis AamdcNuclear Rny1, Polr1d, Nol12,Notch signaling Dtx2Vascular remodeling Reck/St15Ig related S72845Unknown function (10 genes—29%) AK010802, AK007003, AK016406, AK021335, AK015506, AK009275, AK007343,AK006390, AK006570, AK005580Bolded gene names correspond to genes that fits into two groups (because are cancer related and also enzymes).inflammatory state, therefore improving the quality of life[35].4.1. Inflammatory Induction by LPS in 3T3-L1 Is Coun-teracted by Alliin Treatment. Differentiated adipocytes areequipped with the capability to respond directly to innateimmune challenge by LPS from Gram-negative bacteria [21,23, 36]. Some studies have shown the relevance of 3T3-L1adipocytes, fully differentiated in vitro and stimulated byLPS, as a useful model to test for molecules that exhibitsan anti-inflammatory effect and that are able to modulatethe inflammatory state of adipose tissue [37]. LPS causesinduction of IL-6 production, upregulation of TLR-2, anda downregulation of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 [36].Multiple signaling pathways mediate LPS induction of IL-6 [38, 39]. These pathways include NF-𝜅B, c-JNK, ERK,inhibitory G protein, and PKC mediated processes, and Toll-like receptors activate similar but distinct signaling pathwaysdue to their ability to recruit different adapter proteins [22].LPS induces lipolysis in adipocytes via TLR-4 and ERK1/2signaling [40]. Regarding TLR-4, this receptor recognizesLPS as a ligand [41] and it was demonstrated that stimulationof adipocytes by LPS attenuates insulin signaling by stimulat-ing NF-𝜅B signaling, decreasing AKT phosphorylation, andincreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokine genessuch as TNF-𝛼 and IL-6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [42], whichimplicate this receptor in the onset of insulin resistance inobesity and type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, ERK1/2 acti-vation is crucial for the induction of inflammatory changesin adipocytes [43] and leads to enhanced NF-𝜅B activity[44]. Activation of PPAR-𝛽/𝛿 inhibits enhanced cytokineproduction in adipocytes by preventing NF-𝜅B activation viaERK1/2, an effect thatmay aid in preventing insulin resistance[30]. Additionally, stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by LPSinduces adipocytic insulin resistance via the involvement ofJNK [45]. Therefore, ERK1/2 signaling and JNK signalingare relevant in adipose tissue physiology for the regulationof insulin sensitivity and lipolysis [40, 45]. On the basis ofall of this background, and taking into account the resultspresented here, it is reasonable to propose one of the possiblemolecular mechanism by which alliin protects against theLPS effect (Figure 4).Among factors that might mitigate the inflamma-tory response in adipocytes, it has been demonstratedthat pretreatment of adipocytes with adiponectin exertsan anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing IL-6, TNF-𝛼and MCP-1 production from inflamed adipocytes [46, 47].This anti-inflammatory action may be mediated throughinhibition of NF-𝜅B activity, as well as through increasedPPAR-𝛾 expression. Recently, Go´mez-Arbela´ez et al. showedthat AGE is able to improve adiponectin levels in patientswith metabolic syndrome after 12 weeks [48]. Here we showthat a 24 h pretreatment of alliin is able to partially recoveradiponectin levels in LPS-stimulated adipocytes.This furthersupports the anti-inflammatory effect of alliin.In summary, we found that pretreatment with alliincounteracted LPS-induced inflammation. Our findings showthat alliin downregulates IL-6 andMCP-1 expressions, as wellas ERK1/2 phosphorylation. On this basis, our data indicatethat speculation can ensue concerning that one of the alliineffects is caused probably through the NF-𝜅B system, as asignaling pathway used to suppress cytokine production inadipocytes (Figure 4). However, this proposed mechanismdoes not completely eliminate other possibilities such as, forexample, the reduction of inflammation through the, alreadydescribed, antioxidant effect of alliin, which can function asa complementary pathway.4.2. Gene Expression Profile by Microarrays Induced by LPSAffects Several Groups of Genes and This Effect Is Coun-teracted by Alliin. Yamashita et al. [49] have showed thatwhen stimulated with LPS, 3T3-L1 adipocytes coculturedwith murine macrophages, these upregulated the expressionof genes associated with inflammation, insulin resistance,and angiogenesis. The authors analyzed the gene expressionprofile of only 5,693 genes. Here we analyzed the geneexpression profile of 22,000 genes after LPS stimuli with orwithout preincubation with alliin; thus our results extendthe gene expression profile of 3T3-L1 adipocytes elicitedby LPS stimulation, which is consistent with the regulationof the expression genes related with response to peptidehormone stimulus, cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicle,DNA/RNA helicase, DEAD/DEAH box type, ATP-binding,positive regulation of phagocytosis, regulation of vesicle-mediated transport, and ATP-dependent helicase activity, asthe main clusters represented in the analysis (Table 1-SM).We show here the gene expression profile induced byalliin pretreatment in response to LPS inflammatory stimuli8 Mediators of InflammationERK1/2MAPK JAKRAFPPEgr-1TLR-4CD-14proinflammatory cytokinesNucleusIL-6gp130CytoplasmLPS1h++++TNF-𝛼IL-6MCP-1NF𝜅B(a)NucleusCytoplasmERK1/2MAPK TLR-4CD-14LPS1hIL-6gp130NF𝜅B Egr-1Alliin24hTNF-𝛼IL-6MCP-1ONH22CH2=CH–CH2–S–CH2–CH–COOH–✓ Organophosphatemetabolic process✓ Immune effectorprocess✓ Response to stress(b)Figure 4: A proposal of how alliin could counteract the inflammatory state promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.(a) Activation of proinflammatory signaling pathway by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). (b) Alliin could reduce the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)pathway, possibly by diminishing the expression of related genes and proteins such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemostatic protein-1(MCP-1), and early growth receptor-1 (Egr-1) and therefore regulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activity.Mediators of Inflammation 9(Tables 2 and 3). When we analyzed in detail the genesupregulated by alliin pretreatment with a higher median 𝑧-score (>2.5) in two comparisons, we found 10 genes relatedwith immunoglobulin production and with T-cell receptors(Table 2), suggesting that alliin could exert an effect on the3T3-L1 adipocytes inducing lymphopoietic activities. This ishighly relevant in the context of the chronic proinflammatorystate in obesity that is induced by adipocytes and that affectsT-cell activation [50]. The expression of immunoglobulinreceptors by adipocytes has already been mentioned in part[51, 52]; however, it has received nearly no attention. Herewe show that alliin induces a differential expression ofsix immunoglobulin-related genes and four T-cell receptor-related genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These immunoglobulinscould act as anti-inflammatory signals or could at leastinfluence adipocyte metabolism and, together with T-cellreceptor genes, could affect the signaling between adipocytesand T cells.It is also relevant that alliin appears to upregulate Cnpy4(PRAT4B) expression, because this molecule is a chaperonethat has been associated with the regulation of TLR-4 mem-brane localization [53] and could act as a negative regulatorof TLR-1 surface trafficking [54]. Thus, because LPS actionis mediated by TLR-4, it is thus feasible to speculate thatalliin action could modulate this receptor trafficking or itsdistribution on the membrane, to counteract the LPS stimuli.On the other hand, in relation with genes downregulatedby alliin, we found that the gene with the highest down-regulation by alliin was Dck (deoxycytidine kinase). It hasbeen described that 3T3-L1-differentiated adipocytes expressvery low levels when comparedwith proliferating 3T3-L1 cells[55]; additionally, another two genes related with adipocytedifferentiation process, denominated Aamdc [56] and Foxp1[57], were also downregulated.This reflects and confirms thatthe 3T3-L1 cells were fully differentiated as adipocytes whenpreincubated with alliin and stimulated by LPS.In addition, our analysis shows a group of 15 genes that arerelated with cancer (Table 3).The anticarcinogenic propertiesof garlic are well documented. Therefore, we present herea list of genes whose expression is downregulated by alliin,which requires more research to unveil their participation inresponse to alliin treatment and their involvement as anti-carcinogenic factors. Finally, we showed a group of 10 genesthat are downregulated by alliin and whose functions remainunknown, suggesting that a relevant portion of alliin effectsis yet to be identified.Taken together, our results may partially explain theeffect elicited by alliin; however, further studies looking atthe upstream and downstream effector molecules will benecessary in order to understand the role of inflammatorysignals in these impairments. Analyses of the roles of certainother genes with as yet unknown functions, the expressionsof which were significantly changed, are currently in progressin our laboratory. Additionally, it will be of interest to test theeffect of alliin also in immune cells, such as macrophages, orin an in vivo study, where macrophage infiltration is presentin the adipose tissue. Thus, other yet unknown mechanismsappear to account for the loss of LPS responsibility inadipocytes isolated from inflamed adipose tissue.5. Concluding RemarksIn conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate thepossible mechanism by which alliin, a garlic compound,controls the inflammatory state of adipocytes by decreasingIL-6 and MCP-1 expressions (both at mRNA and proteinlevels), as well as diminishing ERK1/2 phosphorylation inLPS-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and generating an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile in adipocytes andmodifying their metabolic profile.Additionally, we confirmed that alliin modifies themRNA expression of genes involved in phospholipid andorganophosphate metabolic processes, in positive regulationof the related immune process (expressing immunoglobulin(Ig) and in T-cell receptor-related genes), some enzymesfor metabolic and energy process, and genes involved incancer. All of these processes can be somehow involved inadipocyte protection against a proinflammatory stimulus;thus, they constitute interesting groups of genes to be furtherexplored as involved in adipocyte physiology derived fromthe alliin action. A deeper understanding of the mechanismsthat regulate anti-inflammatory signaling in adipocytesby alliin action may contribute to unraveling possibletreatments for obesity-induced inflammation and insulinresistance.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that the research was conducted in theabsence of any commercial or financial relationships thatcould be construed as a potential conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by CONACyT-Me´xicoGrants 295457 to SQ-F, PROMEP/103.5/08/2919 to RIL-R, and funds from the Spanish Ministerio de Economiay Competitividad (SAF2012-30708).
