Abstract: The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity of the 
fruits  of  Rubus  chingii  was  studied  in  vitro.  Ethanolic  extract,  ethyl  acetate  and  
n-butanol fractions from dried R. chingii fruits revealed strong DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity with IC50 values of 17.9, 3.4 and 4.0 µg/mL, respectively. The ethyl acetate and  
n-butanol fractions were further purified by a combination of silica gel chromatography, 
Lobar  RP-8  chromatography,  and  high-pressure  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC).  Nine 
compounds were isolated, where methyl (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate (2), 
vanillic  acid  (5),  kaempferol  (7),  and  tiliroside  (9)  showed  stronger  DPPH  free  radical 
scavenging activity than that of ascorbic acid (131.8 µ M) with IC50 values of 45.2, 34.9, 
78.5, and 13.7 µ M, respectively. In addition, rubusine (1) is a new compound discovered in 
the present study and methyl (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate (2), methyl 
dioxindole-3-acetate (3), and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylic acid (4) were isolated 
from the fruits for the first time.

1. Introduction 
Fruits and vegetables are known to contain different antioxidant compounds, and high consumption 
of  these products  has  long been  associated with  a lower incidence of  degenerative diseases.  This 
beneficial association is considered to be partially due to the various antioxidant compounds present in 
OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

these  foods;  these  antioxidants  scavenge  free  radicals  and,  thereby,  reduce  the  manifestation  of 
degenerative pathologies [1–3]. Colorful fruits and green leafy vegetables are rich sources of phenolic 
and  flavonoid  compounds,  which  exhibit  a  range  of  antioxidant,  antibacterial,  anti-inflammatory, 
antiallergic, hepatoprotective, vasodilatory, and neuroprotective activities [4–7].  
For many years, dried fruits of R. chingii Hu (Rosaceae), referred to as ‘‘fu-pen-zi’’ in Chinese, 
have been used as a food and a tonic in traditional Chinese medicine [8]. Fupenzi is used to improve 
the functioning of the kidney and to treat seminal discharge and excessive polyuria [9]. In recent 
decades, modern pharmacological experiments have revealed that R. chingii has immunomodulatory 
effects [10] on bacterial infection, anxiety, pain, inflammation [11], and the hypothalamus-pituitary-sex 
gland axis [12]. Previous phytochemical studies of this plant have led to the isolation of triterpene 
acids,  flavonoids,  phenolics,  and  steroids  [13–18].  In  the  present  study,  the  DPPH  free  radical 
scavenging activity of the extracts and constituents of Chinese medicine was investigated.  
2. Results and Discussion 
2.1. Isolation and Identification of Alkaloids, Phenolics, and Flavonoids from R. chingii 
The ethanolic extract of the dried fruits of R. chingii was partitioned into n-hexane, ethyl acetate,  
n-butanol, and water fractions. The ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions were subjected to silica gel 
chromatography, prep-Lobar RP-8, and preparative high-pressure liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) 
to isolate one new alkaloid compound, rubusine (1), together with eight known compounds (Figure 1). 
Their structures were established on the basis of spectral evidence (Figure 2). The compounds, which 
comprised three alkaloids: methyl (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate (2) [19], methyl 
dioxindole-3-acetate (3) [20], 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylic acid (4) [21]; two phenolics: 
vanillic  acid  (5)  [18]  and  p-hydroxybenzoic  acid  (6);  three  flavonoids—kaempferol  (7)  [15], 
nicotiflorin (8) [17], and tiliroside (9) [14] were identified by comparing the spectroscopic data with 
those in reported literature.  
Rubusine (1) was an amorphous powder in methanol. HR-EIMS revealed an [M
+] at m/z 189.0420, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C10H7NO3. The IR spectrum of 1 revealed absorption bands at νmax 
3450–3200 (OH), 2978, 2895 (NH), and 1650 (C = O) cm
−1 indicating hydroxyl, imide, and ketone groups, 
respectively.  The 
1H  NMR  spectrum  of  1  exhibited  an  aromatic  ring  at  ʴ  7.22  (t,  J  =  7.7  Hz),  
7.36 (d, J = 7.7 Hz), 7.54 (t, J = 7.7 Hz), and 8.13 (d, J = 7.7 Hz). The 
13C NMR spectrum was  
ʴ 115.8, 122.3, 126.1, 130.9, 139.4, and 141.2. The 
13C NMR chemical shifts for two ketone groups at 
ʴ 161.1 were in the B ring. The B ring has a double bond as indicated by the 
1H NMR peak of ʴ 6.86. 
The 
13C NMR peaks of ʴ 123.4 and 166.8 suggest that the double bond possesses one hydroxyl group. 
The results of correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC), and NOESY of the 
1H and 
13C NMR signals are 
shown in Table 1. These data agreed with the structure of rubusine (1) (Figure 2). Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

Methyl (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate (2) was a pale tinted powder and exhibited 
[ʱ]D  +10°  (MeOH). HR-EIMS revealed an [M
+] at  m/z  221.0683, corresponding to  the molecular 
formula C10H7NO3. The UV, IR, 
1H and 
13C NMR spectral data of 2 were similar to those of methyl 
dioxindole-3-acetate (3), except that the methylene proton peaks were recorded at ʴ 3.05 and 3.08 
(each d, J = 15.6 Hz, H-8), and shifted downfield. In addition, C-2 (ʴ 180.9) and C-7a (ʴ 143.7) were 
shifted downfield by ʴ 6.1 and ʴ 5.3, respectively. Comparing with the 
1H and 
13C NMR data of 
compound 3, indicated that compound 2 may be an enantiomer of compound 3. The 
1H NMR spectrum 
of 2 also exhibited an ABCD system of aromatic rings at ʴ 6.88 (dd, J = 7.5, 1.0 Hz), 7.01 (td, J = 7.5, 
1.0 Hz), 7.25 (td, J = 7.5, 1.0 Hz), and 7.35 (dd, J = 7.5, 1.0 Hz) and a methoxyl group of esters  
at  ʴ  3.46. HMBC spectrum  of compound  2 showed H-8 (ʴ 3.05 and  3.08;  each d,  J  = 15.6 Hz) 
correlation to C-2 (ʴ 180.9), C-3 (ʴ 42.3), C-3a (ʴ 131.8), and C-9 (ʴ 171.1).  H-4 (ʴ 7.35, dd, J = 7.5, 
1.0 Hz) was correlated with C-3 (ʴ 42.3), C-3a (ʴ 131.8), and C-7a (ʴ 143.7). Taken together, the 
structural  data  point  to  2  being  methyl  (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate  (2).  The  
1H- and 
13C-NMR signals of 2 were completely assigned using contemporary 2-D NMR techniques 
(COSY-45, HMQC, HMBC and NOESY) and are listed in Table 2.

2.2. DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Activity of Extract, Partitions, and Compounds of R. chingii 
Antioxidants are extensively used in cosmetics, food, and medicine because they can counteract 
cellular free radicals and reduce metal ions, thereby, interrupting the oxidizing chain reaction before 
any damage occurs. Antioxidants, therefore, can combat many health problems [22]. The DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity of the fupenzi fruit extracts and partitions were in the order: ethyl acetate 
layer, n-butanol layer, water layer, ethanol extract, ascorbic acid, n-hexane layer, and ascorbic acid 
(Table 3). The compounds methyl (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate (2), vanillic acid (5), 
kaempferol (7), and tiliroside (9) showed significant free radical scavenging activity with IC50 values 
of 45.2, 34.9, 78.5, and 13.7 µM, respectively. Compound 9 appeared to 9.62-fold as potent as ascorbic 
acid, whereas 2, 5, and 7 were about 2.92, 3.78, and 1.68-fold, respectively, as potent. Compound 8 
had the same antioxidant activity as that of ascorbic acid (Table 4).

Each value represents the mean SD (n = 3);

In the present study, the radical scavenging activity of the compounds tested was influenced by the 
number and the location of the hydroxyl groups, glycosylation, and other substitutions [23]. Compared 
with nicotiflorin (8, IC50 = 130.6 µ M, 23), the DPPH scavenging activity of kaempferol (7, IC50 = 78.5 µ M) 
was 1.66-fold higher. However, tiliroside (9, IC50 = 13.7 µM) exhibited 5.73-fold higher activity than 
that of kaempferol (7). Many of the benefits associated with consumption of phenolic-rich foods are 
correlated with their antioxidant activities [24]. Research has suggested that phenol may prevent lipid Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

peroxidation via hydrogen atom donation from the hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring. The 
present study further demonstrated that the phenolic compounds possessing hydroxyl groups exhibited 
much higher DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Vanillic acid (5, IC50 = 34.9 µM) exhibited higher 
activity  when  compared  with  p-hydroxybenzoic  acid  (6,  IC50  =  311.5  µM)  [25].  An  adjacent 
substituted methoxyl group in the aromatic ring was the most significant difference between the two 
phenolics. A possible explanation for the difference in DPPH free radical scavenging activity is the 
difficulty in forming the reaction complex between the phenolics and the free radicals. The alkaloid 
compound 2-oxo-1, 2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxyloic acid (4, IC50 = 1216.1 µM) has no hydroxyl 
group, and its DPPH free radical scavenging activity was not significant. 
3. Experimental Section 
3.1. Plant Material 
The dried fruits of R. chingii were purchased from Chung-Yuan Company, Kaoshiung, Taiwan. 
Prof. Hang Chang Lin at the National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, identified the plant.  
The R. chingii specimen (No. 960801) has been deposited at the herbarium of the Chia Nan University 
of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan. 
3.2. General Experimental Procedures and Apparatus 
We used a Yanagimoto micromelting point apparatus to determine the melting points, which are 
reported  as  uncorrected  values.  Optical  rotations  were  measured  in  a  GENESYS  20  polarimeter 
(Rochester, New York, NY, USA) The IR spectra were recorded on KBr disks with a Perkin-Elmer 
983 G spectrophotometer, and the UV spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrometer. 
1H 
and 
13C NMR spectra were determined  with a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer using DMSO-d6 and  
MeOH-d4. The FABMS measurements were measured using a JEOL JMX-HX110 mass spectrometer. 
The EIMS were recorded at 70 eV using a Finnigan MAT TSQ 46C GC/MS/MS/D spectrometer.  
The column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (70–230 mesh, Merck). The preparative 
liquid chromatography was performed by a Shimadzu LC-8A chromatograph on a reverse C-18 column 
(Nacalai Teaqe shim-pack, pre-CODSL, 15 um, 50 ×  250 mm, flow rate 15 mL/min). Two Shimadzu 
LC-8A pumps and a Shimadzu SCL-8A system controller were used for preparative HPLC (Shimadu, 
Tokyo, Japan). The chromatography peaks were detected by UV (254 nm) using a Shimadzu SPD6VA 
UV detector. A FMI RP-SY-ICSC Lobar pump was used for the low pressure liquid chromatography 
(Lobar).  Silica  gel  60  (Merck  70–230  mesh,  230–400  mesh;  ASTM)  was  used  for  the  column 
chromatography,  and  silica  gel  60  F254  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  was  used  for  the  
thin-layer chromatography. 
3.3. Extraction, Partition, and Isolation of R. chingii Compounds 
The detailed purification procedure involved in the extraction and separation of the nine compounds 
from R. chingii is shown in Figure 1. The dried fruits (5.0 kg) were ground in a power grinder and 
soaked in 95% ethanol (× 4) at room temperature for 3 days. The extracts were decanted, filtered under 
vacuum,  and concentrated in  a rotating evaporator to  produce  dark brown syrup (extraction  yield Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

5.63% (w/w) dry weight) of 281.4 g. The crude extract was partitioned between n-hexane and 95% 
methanol. The 95% methanol fraction was concentrated and partitioned between ethyl acetate and 
water. The aqueous extract was again partitioned between n-butanol and water. The resulting portion 
generated fractions in the n-hexane layer (41.7 g, 14.8% (w/w) yield), ethyl acetate layer (31.9 g, 
11.3% (w/w) yield), n-butanol layer (101.8 g, 36.2% (w/w) yield), and H2O layer (104.8 g, 37.2% 
(w/w) yield). The ethyl acetate layer was introduced into the silica gel chromatography column and 
eluted with  an  n-hexane–ethyl  acetate mix (3:1, 1:1),  an  ethyl  acetate–ethyl  acetate-methanol  mix  
(3:1, 1:9), and methanol to obtain vanillic acid (5, 8.0 mg), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (6, 67.0 mg), and 
kaempferol (7, 6.5 mg). The n-butanol layer was introduced to the chromatography column on silica 
gel  with  ethyl  acetate,  the  ethyl  acetate–methanol  mix  (19:1,  9:1,  4:1,  1:1),  and  methanol.  
Re-chromatography of the first fraction on prep-Lobar RP-8 was conducted, followed by HPLC separation, 
which  yielded  rubusine  (1,  56.0  mg),  methyl  (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate  
(2, 71.0 mg), methyl dioxindole-3-acetate (3, 22.0 mg), and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylic 
acid (4, 16.0 mg). Similarly, the second fraction produced tiliroside (9, 16.0 mg), and the third fraction 
produced nicotiflorin (8, 60.0 mg).

3.4. DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl) Free Radical Scavenging Assay 
To  measure  the  antioxidant  activity,  the  1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl  (DPPH)  free  radical 
scavenging activity was determined by the spectro-photometric method previously described [26].
 A 
methanol solution of a sample (100 µL) was mixed with a 0.5 mM DPPH methanol solution (800 µ L) 
and 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.5; 100 µL). The absorbance of the mixture at 517 nm was measured 
after standing for 30 min. The IC50 value was determined as the concentration of each sample required 
to give 50% of the absorbance shown by the blank test. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12

4. Conclusions 
This study demonstrated that the ethanolic extract, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water fractions of 
fupenzi  exhibit  potent  DPPH  free  radical  scavenging  activity.  Nine  compounds  were  isolated, 
including  rubusine  (1),  methyl  (3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)-acetate  (2),  methyl 
dioxindole-3-acetate  (3),  2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylic  acid  (4),  vanillic  acid  (5),  
p-hydroxybenzoic acid (6), kaempferol (7), nicotiflorin (8), and tiliroside (9). Compound 1 is a new 
alkaloid compound. Compounds 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 showed potent DPPH free radical scavenging activity. 
These results suggest that fupenzi may be used as a natural antioxidant to improve the quality, stability, 
and safety of cosmetics, foods, and medicines.
