SUMMARY
Membranes of eukaryotic cells contain high lipid-order sterol-rich domains that are thought to mediate tem-
poral and spatial organization of cellular processes. Sterols are crucial for execution of cytokinesis, the last
stage of cell division, in diverse eukaryotes. The cell plate of higher-plant cells is the membrane structure that
separates daughter cells during somatic cytokinesis. Cell-plate formation in Arabidopsis relies on sterol- and
DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN1A (DRP1A)-dependent endocytosis. However, functional relationships
between lipid membrane order or lipid packing and endocytic machinery components during eukaryotic cyto-
kinesis have not been elucidated. Using ratiometric live imaging of lipid order-sensitive fluorescent probes,
we show that the cell plate of Arabidopsis thaliana represents a dynamic, high lipid-order membrane domain.
The cell-plate lipid order was found to be sensitive to pharmacological and genetic alterations of sterol com-
position. Sterols co-localize with DRP1A at the cell plate, and DRP1A accumulates in detergent-resistant
membrane fractions. Modifications of sterol concentration or composition reduce cell-plate membrane order
and affect DRP1A localization. Strikingly, DRP1A function itself is essential for high lipid order at the cell plate.
Our findings provide evidence that the cell plate represents a high lipid-order domain, and pave the way to
explore potential feedback between lipid order and function of dynamin-related proteins during cytokinesis.
Keywords: membrane order, sterol, cytokinesis, DRP1A, Arabidopsis.
INTRODUCTION
Cytokinesis represents the final stage of cell division dur-
ing which the cytoplasm of a single cell is partitioned to
form two daughter cells. A number of differences may be
observed during cytokinesis of various eukaryotes
(J€urgens, 2005; Barr and Gr€uneberg, 2007; Prekeris and
Gould, 2008). However, similarities include the
requirement for membrane fusion to occur at diverse cyto-
kinetic structures, for example at the animal mid-body or
the plant cell plate (J€urgens, 2005; Barr and Gr€uneberg,
2007; Prekeris and Gould, 2008). Precise execution of cyto-
kinesis relies on the correct composition of membrane lip-
ids, including, among others, eukaryotic membrane sterols

(Wachtler et al., 2003; Fernandez et al., 2004; Men et al.,
2008; Boutte et al., 2010). The plant cell plate is a transitory
membrane compartment whose biogenesis requires fusion
of mostly trans-Golgi network-derived secretory vesicles in
the plane of cell division (Samuels et al., 1995; J€urgens,
2005). Vesicle fusion is accomplished by SNARE complex
machineries, of which the KNOLLE syntaxin is a critical
component localized to the cell plate (Lauber et al., 1997).
Expansion of the early cell plate and the final fusion of the
late cell plate with the parental plasma membrane com-
plete separation of daughter cells during cytokinesis of
somatic plant cells (J€urgens, 2005). Cell-plate formation in
Arabidopsis relies on sterol- and DYNAMIN-RELATED PRO-
TEIN1A (DRP1A)-dependent endocytosis (Collings et al.,
2008; Men et al., 2008; Boutte et al., 2010). Dynamin also
accumulates at mid-body membranes during animal cyto-
kinesis (Skop et al., 2004). In addition to DRP1A, other
members of the DRP1 family of Arabidopsis thaliana that
contribute to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are
enriched at the cell plate (Kang et al., 2003a,b; Fujimoto
et al., 2007, 2008) and co-localize with the clathrin light
chain (CLC) at the plasma membrane as well as the cell
plate (Konopka and Bednarek, 2008a; Fujimoto et al.,
2010). The internalization from the cell plate of cargo mole-
cules such as KNOLLE (Boutte et al., 2010), which is
enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles (McMichael et al.,
2013), as well as removal of the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier
from the basal epidermal plasma membrane after cytokine-
sis, requires sterol-dependent endocytosis via a clathrin-
and DRP1A-mediated mechanism (Collings et al., 2008;
Men et al., 2008; Boutte et al., 2010; Mravec et al., 2011).
Sterols are required for correct execution of cytokinesis in
diverse eukaryotes (Wachtler et al., 2003; Fernandez et al.,
2004; Men et al., 2008). Sterols accumulate in the septum
during cytokinesis of the fission yeast Schizosaccharo-
myces pombe as well as in the cytokinetic furrow of the
sea urchins Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis and Lytechi-
nus pictus (Wachtler et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2004; Ng
et al., 2005), and the latter has been suggested to be asso-
ciated with high lipid-order membrane domains (Ng et al.,
2005). Similarly, the mammalian mid-body is thought to
represent a sterol-enriched membrane during final stages
of mammalian cytokinesis (Skop et al., 2004), but this has
not been demonstrated. The mid-body has recently been
found to accumulate specific lipids at high levels, including
ceramides, triacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid and phospha-
tidylserine (Atilla-Gokcumen et al., 2014). A high degree of
lipid packing, also referred to as high membrane lipid
order, is a biophysical feature of membrane rafts (Pike,
2006; Simons and Sampaio, 2011). Lipid order may be
probed using fluorescent, lipid order-sensitive probes,
both in artificial membranes in vitro (Jin et al., 2006; Owen
et al., 2006) and in live cells in vivo (Owen et al., 2012).
The fluorescent probe di-4-ANEPPDHQ has been validated
for determining lipid order in extracted plant membranes
and in live imaging of plant cells (Roche et al., 2008; Liu
et al., 2009; Gerbeau-Pissot et al., 2013). Lipid order affects
the fluorescence emission spectrum of di-4-ANEPPDHQ,
with the spectral region between 500 and 580 nm repre-
senting the ordered phase of the membrane, and fluores-
cence between 620 and 750 nm representing the
disordered phase (Owen et al., 2012). The degree of mem-
brane lipid order may thus be quantified by ratiometric
imaging and subsequent calculation of the generalized
polarization (GP) value (Owen et al., 2012). Here, we com-
bine di-4-ANEPPDHQ-based live imaging of lipid order, cell
biological visualization of sterols and cell-plate proteins,
and biochemical as well as functional genetic analyses to
elucidate the relationship between membrane order, sterol
content and DRP1A function in plant cytokinesis. Our
results reveal that the plant cell plate is a high lipid-order
membrane domain whose lipid order strictly relies on cor-
rect sterol composition and DRP1A protein function.
RESULTS
The cell plate is a dynamic, high lipid-order membrane
domain
In order to explore potential differences in lipid order
between membranes in plant roots, we employed ratio-
metric live imaging using the fluorescent lipid-order
probe di-4-ANEPPDHQ to study root epidermal cells of
Arabidopsis seedlings. We monitored two regions of the
emission spectrum of this probe, reflecting the ordered
and disordered phases (Figure 1a), to generate ratiometric
pseudo-colored GP images, in which red and green corre-
spond to high or low GP values reflecting higher and
lower membrane lipid order, respectively (Figure 1b).
Intriguingly, the cell plate of meristematic cells consis-
tently displayed a higher GP value than the plasma mem-
brane of wild-type seedlings (Figure 1b), which we
confirmed by quantitative and statistical analyses of GP
values from the cell plate and the plasma membrane at
the single-cell level (Figure 2a). Furthermore, analyzing
GP values from cell plates at various cytokinetic stages
(early stage, middle stage and late stage, n = 15 for each
stage) indicated a progressive decrease in cell-plate lipid
order, but the lipid order of the plasma membrane did
not change during cytokinesis (Figure 2b,c and Tables S1,
S2 and S3). In addition, we calculated the GP values for
the cell plate relative to the GP value of the closest
plasma membrane, and noticed a progressive decrease in
the relative GP values from early to middle and late
stages, with the relative GP values from early and late
stages being highly significantly different (Figure 2d and
Table S1). Consistent with these findings, following indi-
vidual cells over time by ratiometric imaging of GP val-
ues throughout cell-plate maturation revealed a dynamic

decrease in cell-plate lipid order, while lipid order of the
plasma membrane remained fairly constant (Figure 2e,f).
The cell plate is a sterol-sensitive, high lipid-order
membrane domain
We confirmed the high lipid order of the cell plate by quantita-
tive analyses of GP values from cell plates and plasma
membranes from large populations of cytokinetic cells
obtained from multiple experiments (Figure 3c and Tables S2
and S3). We used a recently developed membrane lipid order
probe, PY3174 (Kwiatek et al., 2013), in live-cell imaging, and
observed higher GP values for cell plates than for plasma
membranes of cytokinetic cells (Figure S1 and Table S2), very
similar to the results obtained with di-4-ANEPPDHQ.
Together, these findings strongly suggest that the cell plate
represents a high lipid-order membrane domain.
We next assessed whether modifications of the mem-
brane sterol content affect the lipid order of cell-plate
membranes. Membrane order may be modified by the con-
centration and molecular nature of the sterols integrated
into the phospholipid bilayer (Xu et al., 2001; Jin et al.,
2006; Owen et al., 2006; Roche et al., 2008). Genetic and
pharmacological tools allow modulation of sterol concen-
tration and composition in plants. For example, seedlings
defective in the sterol biosynthesis gene CYCLOPROPYLS-
TEROL ISOMERASE1 (CPI1), or treated with the sterol bio-
synthesis inhibitor fenpropimorph (fen), display a
substantially modified sterol profile, primarily accumulat-
ing cyclopropylsterols (He et al., 2003; Men et al., 2008).
We also observed a strong shift of the sterol profile
towards cyclopropylsterols in cpi1-1 mutant root callus,
although the callus retained a significant amount of sitos-
terol (Figure 4a), which was found to be almost completely
absent in seedling roots (Men et al., 2008). The sterol bio-
synthesis inhibitor lovastatin (lov) inhibits the activity of 3-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, causing a reduc-
tion of total sterol concentration (Bach and Lichtenthaler,
1983). Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with 1 lM lov or
50 lg ml1 fen significantly reduced the total amount of
sterols or converted a large proportion of sterols into cy-
clopropylsterols, respectively (Figure 4b). We used the
cpi1-1 mutant and inhibitor treatments to address whether
interference with sterol biosynthesis affects membrane
order as visualized by ratiometric di-4-ANEPPDHQ imag-
ing. Intriguingly, the GP values for cell plates and plasma
membranes of individual cells (Figure 3a) and from large
populations of cytokinetic cells were similar for cytokinetic
cells of the cpi1-1 mutant (Figure 3b,c and Tables S2 and
S3), as well as fen-treated wild-type roots (Figure 3b,c and
Tables S2 and S3). Cells from roots treated with lov also
displayed significantly lower GP values at the cell plate
compared with the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-treated con-
trol (Figure 3c). This is in contrast to the strikingly higher
GP values observed for the cell plates of wild-type cells or
solvent-treated control cells compared to their plasma
membranes (Figure 3b,c and Table S3). Thus, our results
strongly suggest that the cell plate represents a dynamic,
high lipid-order membrane domain that is highly sensitive
to alterations in sterol concentration or composition.

DRP1A and membrane order during plant cytokinesis 749
finding that DRMs from cpi1-1 mutant callus showed levels
similar to the wild-type callus may partly be due to the fact
that the sterol composition profile of cpi1-1 root callus
(Figure 4a) was not as strongly altered as that of cpi1-1-
mutant roots (Men et al., 2008). Although we did not
observe differences in DRM association of the tested CME
proteins between the cpi1-1-mutant and wild-type root cal-
lus, our results clearly show that several CME components
from Arabidopsis root cells preferentially associate with
DRMs, indicating that they may associate with membrane
rafts.
To assess co-localization of CME components with ste-
rol-rich membranes in roots in situ, we used the 3-b-hy-
droxysterol-specific probe filipin III (Grebe et al., 2003) to
co-label fluorescent filipin–sterol complexes with DRP1A,
DRP2B or CLC 2 fused to GFP (DRP1A–GFP, DRP2B–GFP or
CLC2–GFP). We observed that sterols clearly co-localized
with DRP1A–GFP (Figure 5e–g), DRP2B–GFP (Figure 5h–j)
and CLC2–GFP (Figure 5k–m) at the cell plate. Additionally,
CLC2–GFP and sterols co-localized in some intracellular
compartments (Figure 5k–m), most likely the trans-Golgi
network/early endosome (Ito et al., 2012), whose mem-
branes are sterol-enriched (Boutte et al., 2010). Taken
together, several CME components co-localized with ster-
ols at the cell plate in the plane of cell division.
Cell-plate accumulation of DRP1A is sensitive to sterol
composition
Interestingly, specific localization of the KNOLLE syntaxin
in the plane of cell division relies on sterol-dependent
endocytosis in a clathrin- and DRP1A-dependent manner
(Boutte et al., 2010). KNOLLE is constrained to the cell
plate and to endomembrane compartments in wild-type,
but is ectopically found at lateral plasma membranes of
late cytokinetic cells in cpi1-1 and drp1a mutants (Boutte
et al., 2010). We determined whether loss of function of
the two individual DRP2 genes or the two individual CHC
genes also affects KNOLLE cell-plate localization. However,
we did not observe a deviation of KNOLLE localization
from that of the wild-type in drp2a, drp2b, chc1 and chc2
single mutants (Figure S2a–f). This may be due to the
reported redundancy within these two gene families as
indicated by early lethality of respective double mutants
(Backues et al., 2010; Kitakura et al., 2011).
We next evaluated whether altered sterol composition
affects the cell-plate localization of CME components. In
wild-type roots, DRP1A mainly localized along and towards

endomembrane compartments as well as at the plasma
membrane (Figures 5f and 6a). In comparison with wild-
type (Figure 6a), anti-DRP1A immunolabeling at the cell
plate was enhanced in the cpi1-1 mutant (Figure 6b), as
corroborated by quantitative analysis of DRP1A immuno-
fluorescence intensity at the plane of cell division
(Figure 6c). In contrast, the cell-plate localization of
DRP2B–GFP and CLC2–GFP appeared to be unaffected in
cytokinetic cpi1-1-mutant cells (Figure S2g–r), possibly due
to the abundance of other DRP2 and CHC isoforms at the
cell plate, or due to a differential sterol sensitivity of these
proteins compared to DRP1A.
Both genetic and pharmacological interference with
membrane sterol composition induce mis-localization of
KNOLLE at lateral plasma membranes during late cytokine-
sis (Boutte et al., 2010). We obtained similar results for
seedlings treated with 1 lM lov or with a lower fen concen-
tration (50 lg ml1) than applied in previous studies
(200 lg ml1) (Boutte et al., 2010). When compared with
solvent-treated wild-type (Figure 5d,g), fen and lov treat-
ment induced lateral KNOLLE mis-localization (Figure 6e,f,
h,i), under conditions that reduced cell-plate membrane
lipid order (Figure 3b,c). We previously observed KNOLLE
lateral mis-localization in the cyclopropylsterol-accumulat-
ing cpi1-1 mutant; however, this did not strongly affect the
rate of KNOLLE lateral diffusion (Boutte et al., 2010). We
also analyzed lateral diffusion of KNOLLE at the cell plate
of DMSO-treated and lov-treated roots in the presence of
the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide and energy
inhibitors (sodium azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose) by fluo-
rescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses
(Figure S3). Compared with cells from DMSO-treated roots
(Figure S3a,c), functional YFP–KNOLLE displayed only mar-
ginally faster FRAP at cell plates from lov-treated roots
(Figure S3b,c), suggesting that reduction of total sterol lev-
els by lov treatment hardly affects lateral membrane diffu-
sion of YFP–KNOLLE per se, similar to the results obtained
for GFP–KNOLLE in the cpi1-1 mutant (Boutte et al., 2010).
More strikingly, KNOLLE localization is strongly affected by
interference with CME components, and particularly
depends on DRP1A function (Boutte et al., 2010). This
prompted us to investigate whether sterol-modulated

DRP1A and membrane order during plant cytokinesis 751
membrane order may also affect DRP1A localization at the
cell plate. Indeed, compared to solvent-treated control
roots (Figure 6j), higher DRP1A immunofluorescence was
found at the cell plate in fen-treated seedlings (Figure 6k);
this result was supported by quantitative analysis (Fig-
ure 6m). In contrast, reducing sterol concentration by lov
treatment strongly decreased the DRP1A signal (Figure 6l,
m and Figure S2u,v). Similarly, Western blot analysis of
total protein extracts revealed increased DRP1A protein
levels in fen-treated seedlings compared to DMSO-treated
controls, in contrast to the decreased DRP1A protein levels
observed upon lov treatment (Figure S4). Taken together,
our findings reveal differential effects of alterations in ste-
rol composition and concentration on DRP1A localization
at the cell plate.
DRP1A is required for high membrane lipid order at the
cell plate
Previous studies showed that DRP1A and CPI1 function is
required for correct execution of cytokinesis and for endo-
cytosis of cargo proteins such as KNOLLE during late cyto-
kinesis (Boutte et al., 2010) or the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier
after cytokinesis, respectively (Men et al., 2008; Mravec
et al., 2011). Moreover, analysis of the drp1a cpi1-1 double
mutant revealed a strong synergistic interaction of the
DRP1A and CPI1 genes (Boutte et al., 2010). As interference
with sterol composition and membrane order affected the
cell-plate localization of DRP1A, we determined whether
DRP1A contributes to membrane lipid order as visualized
by di-4-ANEPPDHQ. In striking contrast to the wild-type,
which exhibited a higher mean GP value for the cell plate
than for the plasma membrane, cytokinetic cells in drp1a-
single mutants displayed similar mean GP values for the
cell plate and the plasma membrane (Figure 7a,b), indicat-
ing similar lipid order. Hence, DRP1A localization not only
depends on sterol composition, but its activity may also
feedback on the lipid order of cell-plate membranes.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide evidence that the plant cell plate
represents a high lipid-order membrane domain. Sterols
are clearly present in cell-plate membranes but are not
preferentially enriched here compared with the plasma
membrane in cytokinetic cells. However, genetic and phar-
macological interference with sterol biosynthesis strongly
disrupted cell plate-specific membrane order (Figure 8).
This suggests that additional, specifically localized compo-
nents may contribute to membrane order. Strikingly, sev-
eral CME components accumulate at the cell plate (Kang
et al., 2003a,b; Fujimoto et al., 2007, 2008; Boutte et al.,
2010; Mravec et al., 2011), and have been found to be
enriched in DRMs from tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, cells
as well as Arabidopsis leaf plasma membranes (Mongrand
et al., 2004; Minami et al., 2009). Indeed, we found that
CME components were preferentially enriched in DRMs
compared to non-DRMs from Arabidopsis root callus cul-
tures, and observed that DRP1A, DRP2B and CLC2 co-local-
ized with sterols at the cell plate in roots. Thus, sterol-rich,
high lipid-order membranes apparently function as plat-
forms for CME at the cell plate.
The stronger accumulation of DRP1A at the cell plate of
cpi1-1 mutant and fen-treated root cells compared to con-
trol roots, as well as the ectopic accumulation of YFP–
KNOLLE and native KNOLLE at the plasma membrane of
cpi1-1 mutant and fen-treated seedlings during late cytoki-
nesis, are consistent with the increased residence time of
DRP1A foci at the cell cortex in elongated root cells of fen-
treated roots (Konopka and Bednarek, 2008a). Thus, these

results suggest that alterations in sterol composition that
induce accumulation of cyclopropylsterols affect the
release of DRP1A from the membrane during endocytosis
(Figure 8). By comparison, reduction of sterol concentration
by lov treatment reduced the amount of DRP1A at the cell
plate, but also decreased lipid membrane order, similar to
alteration of sterol composition (Figure 8). This implies
that a critical sterol concentration is required for high
membrane order and DRP1A membrane localization. Col-
lectively, our results indicate that DRP1A localization may
be regulated by membrane sterol composition, although it
is possible that alterations of sterol composition affect
overall DRP1A protein abundance, because total DRP1A
levels observed in protein extracts were affected similarly
to DRP1A protein localization at the cell plate as observed
by immunolocalization or use of fluorescent DRP1A fusion
proteins. More intriguingly, DRP1A function itself is
required for high membrane lipid order at the cell plate.
Such potential feedback modulation of membrane lipid
order by DRP1A may occur through its function in endocy-
tosis. DRP1A function in endocytosis is required to restrict
lateral diffusion of KNOLLE to the plane of cell division
(Boutte et al., 2010), as well as for selective asymmetric
internalization of PIN auxin efflux carriers after cell division
(Mravec et al., 2011). Interestingly, sterols accumulate at
the contractile actin ring in fission yeast and sea urchins
during cytokinesis (Wachtler et al., 2003; Takeda et al.,
2004; Ng et al., 2005), and membrane raft components
including dynamin are enriched in the mammalian mid-
body (Skop et al., 2004). Our study on plants, which dis-
play a very different mode of cytokinesis, suggests that
evolutionarily diverse organisms use high lipid-order
membrane domains as platforms for execution of cytokine-
sis. Moreover, our findings provide precedence for a func-
tion of dynamin-like proteins in the lipid order of
cytokinetic membranes. Future studies may reveal whether
various eukaryotes employ dynamin-dependent endocyto-
sis to create high lipid-order domains to drive execution of
their diverse modes of cytokinesis.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plant material and growth conditions
We used the Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heyn. ecotypes Landsberg
erecta (Ler) and Columbia-0 (Col-0), and the following mutants:
cpi1-1 in the Ler background (Men et al., 2008) and cpi1-1 out-
crossed seven times to the Col-0 background, herein referred to
as cpi1-1 in the Col-0 background, drp1arsw9 (Collings et al.,
2008) and drp1a069077 (SALK_069077) in the Col-0 background
(Collings et al., 2008; Boutte et al., 2010), drp2a-1 and drp2b-2
(Backues et al., 2010), and chc1-2, chc2-1 and chc2-2 (Kitakura
et al., 2011) in the Col-0 background. Molecular characterization
of the cpi1-1, drp1a, drp2a-1, drp2b-2, chc1-2, chc2-1 and chc2-
2 mutants was performed by PCR-based genotyping as
described previously (Collings et al., 2008; Men et al., 2008;
Backues et al., 2010; Boutte et al., 2010; Kitakura et al., 2011). In
addition, we used the fluorescent protein marker lines
pKNOLLE:YFP-KNOLLE in the Ler/Niederzenz-0 background (El
Kasmi et al., 2013), pDRP1A:DRP1A-tagRFP;pDRP2B:DRP2B-GFP
in the Col-0 background (Fujimoto et al., 2010), and pDRP1A:
DRP1A-mGFP5 (Kang et al., 2003a) and pCLC2:CLC2-GFP (Kon-
opka and Bednarek, 2008b) in the Wassilewskija background.
Plant growth conditions were as described previously (Fischer
et al., 2006). For DRM extraction and sterol analyses of root cal-
lus, 3-week-old callus cultures of Ler and cpi1-1 (in the Ler
background) were grown as described previously (Encina et al.,
2001) at 22°C, 60% humidity, in the dark.
Drug treatments
For inhibitor treatments, fenpropimorph (Pestanal, Sigma, http://
www.sigmaaldrich.com/) was dissolved in DMSO to give a stock
solution of 200 mg ml1, and lovastatin (Mevinolin, Sigma) was
dissolved in DMSO to 2 mM, respectively. Seedlings were grown
on MS agar plates containing 50 lg ml1 fenpropimorph (fen) or
1 lM lovastatin (lov), or on control plates containing an equal
amount of 0.1% DMSO. Analyses were performed on 5-day-old
seedlings.

Figure 8. Model for sterol and DRP1A action on cell-plate membrane lipid
order.
Alteration of sterol composition by cpi1-1 mutation or fenpropimorph (fen)
treatment induces a decrease in lipid order at the cell plate (CP) and
increased DRP1A accumulation at the CP. The decreased sterol concentra-
tion caused by lovastatin (lov) treatment induces a decrease in lipid order at
the CP and DRP1A residence at the CP. The lipid order of CP membranes is
also decreased in the drp1a mutant, suggesting that DRP1A is needed for
high lipid order. The mode(s) of sterol action on DRP1A requires further
mechanistic analysis, and may include effects in addition to those on lipid
order.

DRP1A and membrane order during plant cytokinesis 753
agar plates containing DMSO, 50 lg ml1 fen or 1 lM lov was
performed by GC/TOF MS exactly as previously described (Men
et al., 2008), except that five independent biological experi-
ments were performed. Sterol analyses from root callus cul-
tures were performed using 20 mg fresh weight of 3-week-old
callus for each individual wild-type and mutant line tested.
Detergent-resistant membrane analysis
All steps of the DRM extraction were performed at 4°C as
described previously (Borner et al., 2005; Boutte et al., 2010). In
brief, root callus tissue derived from roots of 3-week-old Ler or
the cpi1-1 mutant (in the Ler background) was ground in two
volumes of homogenization buffer (12% w/v sucrose, 100 mM
Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), and total membrane was col-
lected as described previously (Borner et al., 2005). Protein
quantification was performed using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, http://www.thermoscienti-
fic.com/) and a Spectra-MAX190 multichannel spectrophotome-
ter (Molecular Devices, http://www.moleculardevices.com/). A
total of 2.5 mg total membrane protein was incubated without
Triton X-100 (ratio 0) or with 20 mg Triton X-100 (ratio 8) for
35 min under agitation (100 rpm). The final volume was kept
constant for the two ratios so that the percentage of Triton X-
100 did not exceed 3% at ratio 8. After sucrose step-gradient
centrifugation, DRMs were collected as described previously
(Borner et al., 2005), and their protein concentration was deter-
mined using the BCA kit. Equal amounts of protein from vari-
ous fractions (5–7 lg) were separated by SDS–PAGE using a
Bio-Rad (http://www.bio-rad.com/) Mini-Protean 3 system, and
subjected to Western blotting. The primary antibodies and dilu-
tions used were: rabbit anti-KNOLLE, 1:1000 (Lauber et al.,
1997); rabbit anti-SMT1, 1:100 (Agrisera, http://www.agrisera.
com/) (Boutte et al., 2010); rabbit anti-CLC2, 1:10 000 (Wang
et al., 2013); mouse anti-CHC-4A8, 1:1000 (ab33474, Abcam,
http://www.abcam.com/); rabbit anti-DRP1A, 1:250 (Backues and
Bednarek, 2010); rabbit anti-ARF1, 1:1000 (Agrisera). The sec-
ondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:3000 (Bio-Rad), and ECL horseradish
peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody,
1:10 000 (Amersham, http://www.gelifesciences.com/). An ECL
Western blotting detection reagent kit (Amersham) was used
for chemiluminescent detection.
Filipin-sterol fluorescence labeling and detection
Five-day-old seedlings were completely submerged in a filipin
III (225 lM; Sigma)/4% w/v paraformaldehyde fixative solution in
microtubule-stabilizing buffer (MTSB) comprising 50 mM PIPES,
5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0 (Grebe et al., 2003). In a con-
ventional microwave oven (Electrolux, http://www.electrolux.
com), specimens were pulsed six or seven times for 30 sec at
90 W with an interval of at least 1 min between each pulse
(Boutte et al., 2011). Staining/fixation were continued for 1 h at
room temperature in the dark, after which the seedlings were
washed three times for 5 min each with sterile distilled water.
In the case of co-labeling with CLC–GFP, the microwave step
was omitted, and the seedlings were stained/fixed for 2 h at
room temperature instead. Root tips were dissected and
mounted in a drop of Citifluor AF1 (Citifluor Ltd, http://citifluor.
com/). Fluorescence was detected by confocal laser scanning
microscopy using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS (http://www.leica-
microsystems.com/) spectral system mounted on a Leica DM
IRE2 inverted microscope. Image acquisition settings were as
described previously (Boutte et al., 2011). The excitation wave-
lengths used were 364 nm (argon UV laser) for filipin-sterol flu-
orescence, 488 nm (argon laser) for GFP and 561 nm (diode
laser) for tagRFP (Figure S2). Fluorescence emission was
detected between 400 and 484 nm, 492 and 557 nm and 580
and 700 nm, respectively. Pictures were overlaid and assembled
using Adobe Illustrator CS6 (http://www.adobe.com/).
Ratiometric di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence microscopy
imaging of membrane lipid order
Di-4-ANEPPDHQ (D36802, Molecular Probes, http://www.lifetech-
nologies.com/) was dissolved in 300 ll DMSO to create a stock
solution of 5 mM, and stored sealed in an air-tight, light-proof
vial at room temperature (21°C) for up to 6 months. Staining solu-
tion was prepared by dissolving 2 ll of di-4-ANEPPDHQ stock solu-
tion in 2 ml of MS medium. Five-day-old seedlings were
submerged in staining solution for 90 min at room temperature.
Specimens were washed three times for 1 min at room tempera-
ture in MS medium, and roots were mounted for observation by
confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 780 Axio
Observer inverted microscope (http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/
en_de/home.html) and a water-corrected Plan-Apochromat 409/
1.20 DIC M27 objective (Zeiss; http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/
en_de/home.html). Di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence was excited at
488 nm, and fluorescence intensity images were recorded simulta-
neously in the ranges 500–580 and 620–750 nm.
The calculation of the GP images obtained from ratiometric
di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence imaging was performed using
ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) following the procedure
described by Owen et al. (2012) and using their custom-written
macro. The ordered (500–580 nm) and disordered (620–750 nm)
phase fluorescence channels were assigned ch00 and ch01,
respectively. The threshold value for the analysis was fixed at
15, the color scale for the output GP images was set to ‘grays’,
and no immunofluorescence mask was selected. The ImageJ
macro for GP analysis generates GP images from ordered and
disordered channel images based on the following equation:
GP ¼ I500 580 GI620 750
I500 580 þGI620 750
where I represents the intensity in each pixel in the image
acquired in the indicated spectral channel (numbers in nm). To
compensate for differences in the efficiency of collection in the
two channels, GP values were corrected using a G factor. In order
to obtain the G factor, the same microscope set-up employed for
imaging root samples was used to image the fluorescence of a
drop of undiluted di-4-ANEPPDHQ stock solution (2 ll) at three
laser powers (0.3%, 0.5% and 1%). The mean pixel intensities of
the channels ch00 (ordered) and ch01 (disordered) were extracted
in ImageJ, and corresponding GPmes values were calculated
(using the previous equation with G = 1). The G factor was then
calculated according to the equation:
G ¼ GPref þGPref GPmes GPmes  1
GPmes þGPref GPmes GPref  1
GPref is a reference value for di-4-ANEPPDHQ in DMSO, here fixed
at -0.85 (Owen et al., 2012). In this study, the G factor was defined
as G = 0.35.
GP values were calculated and pseudo-colored, ratiometric
images were generated in ImageJ. The mean GP values were cal-
culated for fluorescence at the cell plate (CP) and at the closest
plasma membrane (PM) from cytokinetic root tip cells of Col-0
(two independent sets of cells, n = 50 and n = 40), cpi1-1 (in the

Col-0 background) (n = 40), drp1arsw9 (n = 40) and drp1A060977
(n = 40), as well as cells from Col-0 seedlings grown on plates
containing 0.1% DMSO (n = 50), 50 lg ml1 fen (n = 50 cells) or
1 lM lov (n = 50). As distributions of the measured populations of
cells did not follow a normal distribution, the non-parametric,
two-tailed Mann–Whitney U rank order sum test (http://ele
gans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/utest.html) was used to test for sig-
nificance of difference between the distribution of GP values of CP
and PM. First, the difference between the distribution of GP values
in the CP and PM was tested within the same line. Second, the dif-
ference between the distributions of GP values for the CP and GP
values for the PM was compared between Col-0 and the mutant
lines cpi1-1 in the Col-0 background, drp1arsw9 and drp1A060977, or
between Col-0 treated with DMSO and cells from seedlings treated
with fen or lov.
Ratiometric PY3174 fluorescence microscopy imaging of
membrane lipid order
PY3174 was employed using a similar procedure as for di-4-ANE-
PPDHQ. Stock solution for PY3174 (Kwiatek et al., 2013) was
prepared by dissolving 2 mg of the probe in ethanol to a final con-
centration of 6.57 mg ml1. Staining solution was prepared by
dissolving 1 ll of PY3174 stock solution in 2 ml of MS medium.
PY3174 fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence
intensity images were recorded simultaneously in the ranges 505–
590 and 620–690 nm. The ratiometric calculation of the GP images
obtained from PY3174 fluorescence was performed as described
above except that the G factor was defined as G = 0.82. The signif-
icance of the difference between the distribution of GP values for
CP and PM was tested on n = 66 GP values each using a two-
tailed Mann–Whitney U rank order sum test (http://ele
gans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/utest.html).
Immunolocalization and confocal laser-scanning
microscopy
Whole-mount immunofluorescence localization was performed as
described previously (Fischer et al., 2006; Men et al., 2008; Boutte
et al., 2010). In brief, 5-day-old seedlings were fixed in 4% parafor-
maldehyde in MTSB for 1 h, then washed three times with MTSB,
followed by three washes with sterile distilled water. Root tips were
dissected, transferred to polylysine microscope slides (Menzel
Gl€aser, http://www.menzel.de/), and dried at room temperature. Per-
meabilization was achieved by 35 min incubation in 2% Driselase
(Sigma) at room temperature, followed by treatment for 1 h in 10%
DMSO, 3% IPEGAL (Sigma) in MTSB (pH 7.0) at room temperature.
After blocking with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoRe-
search, https://www.jacksonimmuno.com/) in MTSB, primary and
secondary antibodies were applied. Washes were performed as
described previously (Fischer et al., 2006). Prior to mounting in Citi-
fluor AF1, root tips were stained with 2 lg ml1 4’,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 30 min. The primary antibodies and
dilutions usedwere: rabbit anti-KNOLLE, 1:4000 (Lauber et al., 1997)
and rabbit anti-DRP1A, 1:500 (Backues and Bednarek, 2010). Sec-
ondary antibodies were diluted as follows: fluorescein isothiocya-
nate-coupled donkey anti-rabbit, 1:250 (Jackson ImmunoResearch),
Cy5-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:300 (Jackson ImmunoRe-
search) and Dylight 649-conjugated affiniPure donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (H+L), 1:800 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Whole-mount immu-
nolabeling detection and live imaging were performed by confocal
laser scanningmicroscopy using either a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spec-
tral confocal laser scanning microscope mounted on a Leica DM
IRE2 invertedmicroscope or a Zeiss LSM 780Axio Observer inverted
microscope. An oil-corrected 639 objective (NA = 1.4, HCX PL APO
lbd.BL 63.0 9 1.40 oil; Leica) or a Plan-Apochromat 639/1.40 oil DIC
M27 in the Zeiss LSM 780, or a water-corrected 639 objective
NA = 1.2 (HCX PL APO 63.0 9 1.20WBD UV, Leica) were used. Exci-
tation wavelengths were 405 nm (blue diode laser) for DAPI,
488 nm for GFP and fluorescein isothiocyanate, 514 nm (argon
laser) for YFP, 561 nm for tagRFP and 633 nm (helium/neon lasers)
for Cy5/Dylight 649 fluorescence. Fluorescence emission was
detected at 410–510 nm for DAPI, 490–595 nm for GFP (or 497–
550 nm when imaged together with tagRFP), 500–550 nm for fluo-
rescein isothiocyanate, 525–600 nm for YFP, 580–680 nm for tag-
RFP, 638-690 nm for Cy5, and 644–759 nm for Dylight 649. In multi-
labeling studies, detection was performed in sequential line-scan-
ning mode with a line average of 8 for the Leica confocal laser scan-
ning microscope or a line average of 4 for the Zeiss confocal laser
scanning microscope. Pictures from sequential scans were overlaid
and assembled using Adobe Illustrator CS6.
Quantitative analyses of fluorescence intensity
Transmitted light images obtained in parallel with DRP1A fluores-
cence enabled delineation of the cell plate in cells that had low
levels of DRP1A label. Intensity measurements of DRP1A immuno-
fluorescence or DRP1A–GFP were performed using ImageJ. The
cell plate for each cytokinetic cell was encircled using the ‘Polygon
selection’ tool, and the pixel intensity at the cell division plane
was obtained using the ‘histogram’ option of the ‘Analyze’ menu.
The mean pixel intensity was obtained by multiplying each inten-
sity level (0–255) by the number of pixels displaying that corre-
sponding intensity. Subsequently, the sum of all pixel intensity
values was divided by the total number of pixels. Additionally, the
same selection tool was used to define a region in the back-
ground, and the mean pixel intensity was measured in this area.
For each cell, the mean pixel intensity at the cell division plane
was corrected for background fluorescence. Values obtained were
divided into classes, and these classes were plotted on a graph to
obtain the distribution per genotype or treatment. Measurements
were obtained for wild-type and cpi1-1 mutant seedlings immuno-
stained with anti-DRP1A antiserum. In addition, we quantified the
DRP1A immunofluorescence in wild-type seedlings treated with
fen, lov or DMSO, as described above. Furthermore, GFP fluores-
cence was quantified in DRP1A–GFP-expressing seedlings treated
with fen, lov or DMSO. Statistical significances were calculated
using the non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney U rank order
sum test (http://elegans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/utest.html).
FRAP analyses
FRAP analyses were performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 Axio Obser-
ver inverted confocal laser scanning microscope with a water-cor-
rected 409/1.2 C-Apochromat M27 objective (Zeiss). Pre-bleach and
post-bleach signals of YFP–KNOLLE fluorescence were detected at
1% laser power for the 514 nm laser excitation line and 510–
620 nm emission settings. One bleach frame of 2 lm diameter at
the membrane was placed in the middle of the cell division plane.
Photobleaching was performed using ten 3.64 s bleach scan peri-
ods and 100%main laser power for the 514 nm excitation laser line.
Values from the plane of cell division were normalized for loss of
fluorescence caused by photobleaching by correcting for differ-
ences between pre- and post-bleach values observed in neighbor-
ing cells. For each treatment condition, 13 cells from 13 individual
roots were analyzed. Values were normalized to pre-bleach values
and post-bleach values corresponding to 100% and 0%, respec-
tively. The half-time (t½) required for fluorescence in the photo-
bleached region to recover to 50% of the recovery asymptote was
15 min. The significance of the subtle deviations observed between

DMSO- and lov-treated cell populations analyzed by FRAP was
determined using Student’s two-tailed, two-sample t test assuming
equal variance.
Western blot analysis of total protein extracts
Total protein was extracted from 5-day-old seedlings grown on
MS agar plates containing 50 lg ml1 fen or 1 lM lov, or control
plates containing an equal volume of 0.1% DMSO compared to
the fen- and lov-containing plates. Seedlings were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and ground with a fine pestle in 200 ll extraction buffer
per 20 seedlings. The extraction buffer comprised 25 mM Tris/HCl
pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl,
0.2% Tween-20, 10 ll ml1 proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma
Aldrich) and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Supernatants were collected after
10 min centrifugation at 11 000 g, and used for Western blot
analyses. Protein quantification was performed using Bradford
reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (30 lg) were sepa-
rated by SDS–PAGE using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 3 system, and
subjected to Western blotting. The primary antibodies and dilu-
tions used were: mouse monoclonal anti-Hsc70 antibody and
plant ER BiP (endoplasmic reticulum Binding Protein), 1:1000
(Nordic Biosite AB, http://www.nordicbiosite.com/), rabbit anti-
DRP1A, 1:500 (Backues and Bednarek, 2010) and rabbit anti-
KNOLLE, 1:1000 (Lauber et al., 1997). The secondary antibodies
were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Bio-Rad), 1:3000 and horseradish peroxidase-linked ECL donkey
anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody, 1:10000 (Amersham). An ECL Wes-
tern blotting detection reagent kit (Amersham) was used for
chemiluminescent detection.
