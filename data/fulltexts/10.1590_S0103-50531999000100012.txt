Os quassinóides C25 20(R)- e 20(S)-simarolídeo foram isolados de Simaba cuneata, Sima-
roubaceae. As estruturas destas substâncias foram caracterizadas por dados espectrais, incluindo
espectros de RMN 1D e 2D que foram também usados para a completa atribuição dos deslocamentos
químicos dos átomos de carbono e hidrogênio.
The C25-quassinoids 20(R)- and 20(S)-simarolide were isolated from Simaba cuneata, Sima-
roubaceae. The structures of these two compounds were characterized by spectral data, including
1D and 2D NMR spectra which were also used for the complete assignment of the carbon and
hydrogen atom chemical shifts.
Keywords: Simaba cuneata, Simaroubaceae, C25-quassinoids
Introduction
20(R)-simarolide (1a), a C-25 quassinoid was first iso-
lated from Simarouba amara. Its structural elucidation,
including absolute stereochemistry has already been de-
scribed in the literature1,2. The phytochemical study of a
Simaba cuneata specimen has allowed the isolation of (1a)
and its C-20 epimer (1b). The characterization of these two
quassinoids was based on spectral data analysis, obtained
from the diacetylated derivatives 2a and 2b, especially
NMR [(1D: 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR-PND and 13C-NMR-
DEPT) and (2D: 1H x 1H-COSY, 1H x 1H-NOESY, HMQC
and HMBC)]. The NMR data comparison of both com-
pounds isolated from Simaba cuneata allowed the localiza-
tion of an acetoxyl group at C-11 (1a and 1b, Table 1), and
the correct assignment of the chemical shifts of all hydro-
gen (δH) and 13-carbon (δC) atoms of both diacetyl deriva-
t ives (2) ,  20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a)  and
20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b).
The presence of a carbonyl group at C-17 led us to
discuss the possibility of 1b being the result of a C-20
epimerization (α carbon to the carbonyl group) of the major
natural compound 20(R)-simarolide (1a), during the extrac-
tion and isolation processes. However, the bioproduction
of 20(S)-simarolide still can not be discarded.
Results and Discussion
The 13C-NMR spectra signals of 2a and 2b (Table 1)
corresponding to quaternary carbons [(C)9: two ketone
carbonyls, four ester and lactone carbonyls and three Csp3
in C-C bonds], methines [(CH)8: three Csp3 attached to
oxygen and five Csp3 involved in C-C bonds], methylenes
[(CH2)6: one Csp3 attached to oxygen and five Csp3 in-
volved in C-C bonds] and methyls [(CH3)6: four involved
in C-C bonds and two attached to Csp2 carbonyl carbon]
were identified by the comparative analysis of the hydrogen
decoupling spectra (PND = proton noise decoupling) and
by the DEPT technique (Distortionless Enhancement by
Polarization Transfer, θ = 90°: only CH signals; θ = 135°:
CH2 signals in opposite phase to CH and CH3; after the
removal of these signals from the PND spectra, the quater-
nary carbon signals were obtained)3. Based on small chemi-
cal shift differences observed between 2a and 2b we
suggested that they were diastereomers.

The number of functional groups {two carbonyl ketones
(2a: δC 211.90, C-17 and 206.60, C-1; 2b: δC 211.96, C-17

ies carbons [2a: (C)3; 2b (C)3], methine [2a: (CH)8; 2b:
(CH)8], methylene [2a: (CH2)6; 2b: (CH2)6] and methyls
remaining [2a: (CH3)4; 2b: (CH3)4]}, combined with the δC
and δH and the multiplicity of the hydrogen atom signals
observed in the 1H-NMR spectra (1D and 2D 1H x 1H-
COSY), have allowed the structure of simarolide (1a), a
quassinoid with twenty five carbon atoms (C25) isolated
from Simarouba amara1 to be proposed. The relative stere-
ochemistry of 1a was defined on the basis of X-ray analy-
sis1,2. This is the first report of the complete NMR carbon
and hydrogen assignment
 
of
 1a.
The 1H-NMR (Table 2) and 1H x 1H-COSY of 2a and
2b revealed small significant differences for the protons
H-20 [2a: δH 4.31 (m); 2b: δH 4.30 (m)] and CH2-21 [2a:
δH 4.59 (t, J = 7.2 Hz) and 4.30 (m); 2b: δH 4.60 (t, J = 7.6
Hz) and 4.34 (m)], clearly showing different spectral pat-
terns (Figure 1 and 2). These differences were confirmed
by the comparison (Figure 3 and 4) of the heteronuclear
correlation spectra (HMQC)4,5 of 2a and 2b (two epimers
at C-20), which revealed the δC CH-20 [2a: δC/ δH 41.50
(CH-20)/4.31 (m, H-20); 2b: δC/ δH 41.58 (CH-20)/4.30 (m,
H-20)] and CH2-21 [2a: δC/ δH 70.26 (CH2-21)/4.59 (t,
H-21) and 4.30 (m, H-21b); 2b: δC/ δH 70.22 (CH-21)/4.60
(t, H-21a) and 4.34 (m, H-21b)] and have permitted the
observation of distinct chemical shifts for H-20 (δH 4.31)
in 2a and (δH 4.30) in 2b, and for H-21 (δH 4.30) in 2a and
(δH 4.34) in 2b. Therefore, it was possible to deduce that
the two acetylated derivatives 2a and 2b differ only in the
stereochemistry of the chiral carbon C-20. From HMQC
spectra of 2a and 2b it was possible to assign all chemical
shifts for both, hydrogen and hydrogenated carbon atoms
(Tables 1 and 2), also establishing the δH observed for
CH-20 (2a: δH 4.31 (m); 2b: δH 4.30), which is surprising

for a methine hydrogen occupying the α position in relation
to the carbonyl group, since the δC [2a: δC 41.50 (CH-20);
2b: δC 41.58 (CH-20)] revealed to be compatible with the
parameters expected for δC in these structural conditions3.
The unequivocal assignment of the δC of all 2a carbon
atoms (Table 1) was assured by the analysis of the hetero-
nuclear correlation bidimensional spectrum, HMBC.
Therefore, for example, the spin-spin interactions of C-1
(δC 206.60) with the 3H-19 [δH 1.24 (Table 2), 3JCH] and
C-17 (δC 211.90) with the H-12ax [δH 1.69 (Table 2), 3JCH]
and the 3H-18 [δH 0.98 (Table 2), 3JCH] have allowed the
correct assignment of the chemical shifts for C-1 and C-17.
Other long range correlations can be found in Table 1.
Based on the correct assignment of C-1 (δC 206.60) and
C-17 (δC 211.90), it was possible to reassign the chemical
shifts for this structure and correct some data from the
literature. So, the assignment of the δC of C-1 (δC 214.17)
and C-17 (numbered as C-22 in reference 6: δC 200.55) of
the quassinoid (3) isolated from Picrasma javanica6 should
be corrected to C-1 (δC 200.55) and C-22 = C-17 (δC
214.17), as observed in the quassinoid (4) isolated from
Picrasma ailanthoides7, since a solvent (pyridine-d5) effect
should not be responsible for such a modification. The
comparison of the 13C-NMR chemical shift for 2a and 2b
also permitted the correct assignment of the 2b quaternary
carbon δC (Table 1).
With the unequivocal assignment of the δH for 2a and
2b through analysis of the HMQC spectrum (Tables 1 and
2), the homonuclear correlation 1H x 1H-COSY has allowed
the recognition of all spin-spin interactions of the hydrogen
atoms, especially CH-20, CH2-21 and CH2-22 (Fig. 1). The
spectrum of 2a revealed, not only the vicinal interactions,
but also the coupling of H-21a [δH 4.59 (t)] in W or M
(zig-zag)5 with H-22 [δH 2.75 (m)], which was not observed
in the spectrum of
 2b (Fig. 1). This comparative analysis
allowed the suggestion that the γ-lactone ring in 2a adopts
a conformation in which the spin-spin coupling through syn
periplanar four bonds with H-21a and H-22 is possible in a
W or M geometry (4Jw-H,H), not observed in 2b. The con-
formational behavior differences of the γ-lactone ring on
both epimers (2a and 2b) can only be justified by a steric
interference involving the C-ring and the CH3-18 and CH3-
30 methyl groups. In fact, the most significant differences
in the interatomic distances (Table 3), measured at the
minimum energy conformation (2a: 102.95 kcal/mol; 2b:
100.49 kcal/mol) using the molecular modeling program -
PCMODEL (version 3.0), involve H-20 and 3H-18 hydro-
gen atoms (2a: 3.867, 4.230, 5.120 Å, with a mean approxi-
mated value = 4.406 Å; 2b: 2.363, 3.583, 3.746 Å, with a
mean approximated value = 3.231 Å); ∆Å = 4.406 - 3.231
= 1.175 Å) and 2H-12 hydrogen atoms (2a: 3.804 and 5.000
Å, with a mean approximated value = 4.402 Å; 2b: 1.880
and 3.447 Å, with a mean approximated value = 2.663 Å;
∆Å = 4.402 - 2.663 = 1.739 Å). These data were employed
to show, as foreseen, that the epimerization of the CH-20

chiral carbon produces diastereoisomers with different en-
ergies and interatomic differences between H-20 and the
hydrogen atoms bonded to carbons placed close to the
chiral center.
The 1H x 1H-NOESY dipolar interaction bidimensional
spectra of 2a and 2b (Table 4) were used to confirm the
trans junctions of the A/B and B/C rings and cis junctions
of the B/δ-lactone and C/δ-lactone rings and their corre-
sponding conformations. The interpretation difficulties ob-
served for the spatial interactions (dipolar-dipolar
coupling) due especially to the proximity of H-20 and
H-21b absorption positions, involving CH-20, CH-21 and
2H-22 hydrogen atoms were attenuated by the calculation
of the interatomic distances (Table 3). Therefore, it was
possible to assume the existence of NOE’s between H-20
(δH 4.30) and H-12eq (δH 2.49) and 3H-18 (δH 0.98) of 2b,
which were not observed in 2a (Table 3). Furthermore, in
the 1H x 1H-NOESY spectrum of 2b, a dipolar interaction
was observed between H-11ax (δH 4.92) and H-22 (δH
2.75), indicating spatial proximity of these two hydrogen
atoms. As in the spectrum of
 2a, the spatial proximity of
H-21b (δH 4.30) with H-12eq (δH 2.49), 3H-18 (δH 0.98)
and 3H-30 (δH 0.90) could also be assumed. These data
were used to postulate the configuration 20(R)-2-O-acetyl-
simarolide (2a) for the acetylated derivative of the major
natural product (1a) and 20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b)
of the minor natural product (1b). This proposal is in
agreement with the specific rotation {2a: [α]D = -14.0° (c
0.8, CHCl3); 2b [α]D = -19.2° (c 1.48, CHCl3)} and with
biogenetic considerations, since Simarouba amara1, Pi-
crasma javanica6, Picrasma ailanthoides7, are biopro-
ducers of C25 quassinoids with 20(R) carbon, and Simaba

cuneata belongs to the same Simaroubaceae family. This
biogenetic consideration reinforces the possibility of 1b
being a product formed by an epimerization reaction that
may have occurred during the extraction and isolation
process, but still does not definitely rule out its biogenetic
origin.
Finally, the mass spectrum of 2a and 2b, obtained by
electronic impact at 70 eV, has revealed the peak corre-
sponding to the molecular ion (m/z 546, 1%), and the peaks
with m/z 486 (29 %) as well as the peaks m/z at 427 (7 %)
and 426 (16 %) Daltons (M-AcOH – AcO• and/or M-AcO•
- AcOH, and M-AcOH-AcOH respectively). Other peaks
classified as being important for the structural information
can be found summarized in Scheme 1. The analysis of the
mass spectrum can also be useful for investigations involv-
ing the study of crude extracts by GC/MS8.
Experimental
General
The melting points were determined in a Microquimica
MQRPF-301 digital model equipment
 
with heating plate.
The IR spectra were registered on KBr pellets in a Pelkin-
Elmer spectrometer. The Bruker ARX-400 model spec-
trometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) was used to obtain
the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra, using CDCl3 as solvent
and TMS as internal reference. The low resolution mass
spectra were obtained in a Fisons/Plataform DI/MS 2000
model operating at 70 eV. The specific rotation measure-
ments [α]D were done in a Perkin-Elmer model 241 digital
polarimeter, using 20 s intervals for each reading, averaging
a total of ten measurements. For the chromatographic
analysis a drop countercurrent chromatograph Eyela DCC-

82 20(R)- and 20(S)-Simarolide Epimers Isolated from Simaba cuneata J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
300 model, equipped with 300 columns (42.0 x 0.3 cm) and
also with Merck silica gel columns (40-60 µm) were used.
Plant material
The aerial parts of Simaba cuneata St.Hill. were col-
lected in January of 1993, in highway of Sol, Guarapari -
ES, and were identified by Prof. Dr. José Rubens Pirani.
The respective voucher can be found deposited in the
Herbarium of the São Paulo University, Biosciences Insti-
tute - SP. The leaves, bark and branches were dried sepa-
rately in a stove with a circulation of air at 30 °C and
afterwards were milled in a Willey mill.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents
The branches (680 g) were extracted consecutively with
hexane and methanol at room temperature. After distilla-
tion of the solvents were obtained, respectively, 2.1 g and
6.4 g of solid residues. The residue obtained from the
MeOH extraction (~5.5 g) was submitted to droplet coun-
tercurrent chromatography in descendent mode, using
CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (5:5:3 v/v) as solvent. The organic
phase was mobile and the aqueous phase was stationary.
After 56 h of analysis, 259 fractions, 13 mL each, were
collected and divided into 8 groups based on the results
from analytical TLC. The fraction 3 (789 mg) was submit-
ted to chromatography on a silica gel column, under pres-
sure, using CHCl3:MeOH (95:5 initial v/v) as eluent, with
an eluting gradient till MeOH (100%). 20 fractions, 20 mL
each, were obtained. The fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120
mg) have supplied, respectively, the impure quassinoids 1a
and 1b.
Acetylated derivations
The fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120 mg), previously
described, were acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine
(2:1), as usual, during 12 h. The acetylated derivatives 2a
(395 mg) and 2b (8 mg) were obtained and purified by
re-crystallization in MeOH.
