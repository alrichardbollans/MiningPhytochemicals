ABSTRACT: In addition to three known phytoecdysteroids, a new phenolic glycoside (named, 
chenoalbuside) was isolated from the methanol extract of the seeds of Chenopodium album. While 
the structures of all phytoecdysteroids were elucidated by direct comparison of their spectroscopic 
data with published data, the structure of chenoalbuside was determined unequivocally by a 
combination of UV, MS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses.  The antioxidant potential 
of the new compound was assessed by the DPPH assay, and the RC50 value was found to be 1.4 x 
10-4 mg/mL.

INTRODUCTION
 Chenopodium album L., commonly known as 
‘pigweed’, ‘fat hen’ or ‘lambs-quarters’ belongs to the 
family Chenopodiaceae. It is a woody annual, widely 
distributed in Europe, North America and Asia (Bailey, 
1977; GRIN Database, 2005). Previous phytochemical 
studies on this plant furnished the presence of aldehyde 
(Tahara et al., 1994; Maruta et al., 1995), alkaloids 
(Horio et al., 1993; Cutillo et al., 2004), apocarotenoids 
(DellaGreca et al., 2004), fl avonoids (Gohar; Elmazar, 
1997), phytoecdysteroids (Dinan, 1992, Dinan et al., 
1998; DellaGreca et al., 2005a), and an unusual xyloside 
(DellaGreca et al., 2005b). Various bioactivities, 
including antifungal (Tahara et al., 1994; Maruta et al., 
1995), antipruritic, antinociceptive (Dai et al., 2002) and 
hypotensive (Gohar; Elmazar, 1997) properties, of crude 
extracts or isolated compounds from this plant were 
reported. As part of our on-going search for plant-derived 
antioxidants (Delazar et al., 2005; Delazar et al., 2004; 
Nahar et al., 2005; Sarker et al., 2005a,b; Sarker et al., 
2003; Uddin et al., 2004), we now report on the isolation, 
structure elucidation and antioxidant activity of a new 
phenolic glycoside, named chenoalbuside (1), from the 
methanol extract of the seeds of C. album. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS
General
UV spectra were obtained in MeOH using a 
Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-Vis spectrometer (Agilent, 
Waldbron, Germany).  CIMS (Chemical Ionisation 
Mass Spectrometry) analyses were performed in EPSRC 
Central Mass Spectroscopy Facility in Swansea, UK, 
on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole instrument 
(Waters, Manchester, UK) in chemical desorption mode 
using ammonia as CI gas; mass accuracy was within 0.4 
Da; CI source temperature 170 oC and electron energy 
59eV.  NMR spectra were obtained in CD3OD using a 
Varian Unity INOVA 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. 
HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence) spectra 
were optimised for a long-range JH-C of 7Hz.  Preparative 
reversed-phase HPLC was carried out in a Dionex 580 
HPLC system coupled with a UVD340S photo-diode-
array detector and Gina50 autosampler (Gynkotek).  A 
Luna C18 preparative column (21.2 x 250 mm, 10 μm) 
from Phenomenex (UK) was used.  Sep-Pak Vac (Waters, 
USA) 10 g cartridge was used for pre-HPLC fractionation 
of the MeOH extract.  2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH) was purchased from Fluka (UK).
Plant material
The seeds of Chenopodium album L. were 
purchased from B and T World Seeds, Sarl, Paguignan, 
France. A voucher specimen (PH005001 SDS) has been 
deposited in the herbarium of Plant and Soil Science 
Department, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.
Extraction and isolation
 The ground seeds (50 g) of C. album were 
Soxhlet-extracted, successively, with n-hexane, 
dichloromethane and methanol (1.1 L each).  All three 
extracts were concentrated using a rotary evaporator at a 
temperature not exceeding 50 oC. From the preliminary 
thin layer chromatographic analysis, it was obvious that

the n-hexane and DCM extracts contained predominantly 
long-chain alkanes, and fatty alcohols, acids and esters, 
and therefore were not subjected to further phytochemical 
purifi cation. The MeOH extract was subjected to pre-
HPLC fractionation on a Sep-Pak cartridge eluted with 
a step gradient using 30, 60, 80 and 100% MeOH in 
water (250 mL each).  Preparative reversed-phase HPLC 
(mobile phase: 0-50 min, linear gradient from 30 to 
100% MeOH in water; 20 mL/min, detection at 220 nm) 
of the SepPak fraction, which resulted from the elution 
with 60% MeOH in water, produced previously reported 
phytoecdysteroids, 20-hydroxyecdysone (37 mg), 20-
hydroxy-24-methylen-ecdysone (2.3 mg) and 20, 26-
dihydroxyecdysone (5.1 mg; 25R:25S = 4:1) (Lafont and 
Wilson, 1996), and the structures of these compounds 
were determined by spectroscopic means. A similar 
reversed-phase preparative HPLC purifi cation (mobile 
phase: 0-40 min, linear gradient from 25 to 55% MeOH 
in water; 20 mL/min, detection at 220 nm) of another 
SepPak fraction (30% MeOH in water) yielded the novel 
compound, chenoalbuside (1, 6.1 mg). The structure of 
this compound was determined conclusively by a series 
of spectroscopic data analyses.
 Chenoalbuside (1): Brown amorphous; UV λmax 
(MeOH) nm: 234, 296; CIMS m/z: 514 [M+NH4]+; 1H 
and 13C NMR: Table 1.
DPPH assay
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 
molecular formula C18H12N5O6, was used in this assay to 
assess the free radical scavenging (antioxidant) property 
of 1 (Kumarasamy et al., 2002; Takao et al., 1994). 
Quercetin, a well-known natural antioxidant, was used as 
a positive control. DPPH (4 mg) was dissolved in MeOH 
(50 mL) to obtain a concentration of 80 μg/mL.  
Qualitative Assay: Test compound (1) was 
applied on a TLC plate and sprayed with DPPH solution 
using an atomiser. It was allowed to develop for 30 min. 
The white spots against a pink background indicated the 
antioxidant activity.
Quantitative Assay: For the quantitative assay, 
the stock solution of compound (1) was prepared in 
MeOH to achieve a concentration of 1 mg/mL.  Dilutions

were made to obtain concentrations of 5x10-2, 5x10-3, 
5x10-4, 5x10-5, 5x10-6 5x10-7, 5x10-8, 5x10-9, 5x10-10 mg/
mL. Diluted solutions (1.00 mL each) were mixed with 
DPPH (1.00 mL) and allowed to stand for 30 min for any 
reaction to occur. The UV absorbance of these solutions 
was recorded at 517 nm. The experiment was performed 
in triplicate and the average absorption was noted for 
each concentration. The same procedure was followed 
for the positive control (quercetin). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 Reversed-phase preparative HPLC purifi cation 
of the SepPak fractions obtained from the methanol 
extract of the seeds of C. album afforded three known 
phytoecdysteroids, 20-hydroxyecdysone, 20-hydroxy-
24-methylen-ecdysone and 20, 26-dihydroxyecdysone 
(25R:25S = 4:1), and a novel phenolic glycoside, 
chenoalbuside (1). While the structures of the 
phytoecdysteroids were determined readily by direct 
comparison of their spectroscopic data with published data 
(Lafont; Wilson, 1996), the structure of 1 was elucidated 
by comprehensive spectroscopic data analyses, including 
UV, MS, 1D and 2D NMR. 
 The UV absorption maxima at 234 and 296 nm 
indicated the presence of a benzenoid structure with a 
conjugated carbonyl functionality.  The CIMS analysis 
revealed the pseudomolecular ion, [M+NH4]+ at m/z 
514, conducive to the molecular formula C23H28O12. The 
1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) displayed signals, 
which could be attributed to a tetra- and a tri-substituted 
benzene rings, an ester carbonyl, an oxymethylene, three 
methoxyl groups, and a glucosyl unit.  The 1H and 13C 
NMR data of 1 were similar to those for obtusaside, 
isolated from Hypoxis obtusa (Msonthi et al., 1990), with 
some striking differences in the signals associated with the 
tri-substituted benzene ring and the oxymethylene group. 
The 1H-13C HSQC experiment helped the identifi cation 
of all carbons directly linked to the methane, methylene 
and methyl protons. The 1H-13C HMBC analysis (Table 1) 
provided information on the 2J and 3J 1H-13C long-range 
correlations.  In this analysis, a 3J correlation form H2-6’’ 
(δH 4.58 and 4.38) to the carbonyl (C-7, δC 164.8) of the 
3-hydroxy-2,6-dimethoxybenzoate moiety.  Similarly, a 
3J correlation from the oxymethyle H2-7’ (δH 6.05 and 
4.80) of the 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylalcohol moiety, 
to the glucose anomeric carbon (C-1’’, δC 101.9), and a 3J 
correlation from the glucose anomeric proton (δH 4.92) to 
the oxymethylene carbon (δC 70.1) confi rmed the ether 
formation between C-1’ and C-1’’.  While the position 
of all three methoxyl groups on the benzene rings were 
confi rmed by the detailed 1H-13C HMBC analysis (Table 
1), further confi rmation on the placement of 2-OMe and 
3’-OMe was obtained from the nOe interactions observed 
in the 1H-1H NOESY spectrum (Figure 1), respectively, 
between 2-OMe (δH 3.88) and H-3 (δH 6.87), and 3’-
OMe (δH 3.89) and H-2 (δH 7.18).  Thus the structure 
of this phenolic glycoside was determined conclusively 
as chenoalbuside (1). It is noteworthy that unlike 
obtusaside, where the oxygenations are at C-2’ and C-5’, 
the oxygenation on the benzyl alcohol moiety in 1 were 
at C-3’ and C-4’.  To our knowledge, chenoalbuside (1) is 
a novel natural product.
In the DPPH assay, chenoalbuside (1) showed

signifi cant levels of free radical scavenging (antioxidant) 
activity compared to that of the positive control, quercetin. 
The RC50 values for 1 and quercetin were found to be 1.4 x 
10-4 and 2.88 x 10-5 mg/mL, respectively. The antioxidant 
activity of 1, like other natural phenolic antioxidants, e.g. 
fl avonoids (Kumarasamy et al., 2004), is a consequence 
of the presence of the phenolic moieties in the structures. 
The antioxidant activity of phenolic natural products is 
predominantly owing to their redox properties, i.e. the 
ability to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors and 
singlet oxygen quenchers, and to some extent, could also 
be due to their metal chelation potential (Kumarasamy et 
al., 2004).
