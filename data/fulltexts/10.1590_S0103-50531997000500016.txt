As frações solúveis em hexano dos rizomas ou das folhas de cinco espécies do gênero Dorstenia
(Moraceae) (D. bahiensis Kl., D. bryoniifolia Mart ex. Miq., D. carautae C.C.Berg., D. cayapiaa
Vell. e D. heringerii Car. & Val.) foram analisadas por HRGC-MS (cromatografia gasosa de alta
resolução acoplada a espectrometria de massas). Foram identificados triterpenos pentacíclicos,
esteróides e furocumarinas. HRGC-MS mostrou ser uma ferramenta valiosa para a análise dos
terpenóides de Dorstenia spp. Estas substâncias podem estar ligadas à utilização tradicional de
Dorstenia spp. como plantas anti-ofídicas.
The hexane-soluble fractions from the rhizomes or from the leaves from five Dorstenia
(Moraceae) species (D. bahiensis Kl., D. bryoniifolia Mart ex. Miq., D. carautae C.C.Berg, D.
cayapiaa Vell. and D. heringerii Car. & Val) were analysed by HRGC-MS (high-resolution gas
chromatography - mass spectrometry). Pentacyclic triterpenes, steroids and furocoumarins were
identified. HRGC-MS is shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of terpenoidal compounds from
Dostenia species. These compounds may be related to the folk utilization of Dorstenia species as
antiophidicals.

Introduction
The genus Dorstenia L. (Moraceae) includes several
Brazilian species which are utilized in folk medicine due
to their alleged medicinal properties, mainly in skin dis-
eases and as antiophidics1. In these plants, furocoumarins
are the most abundant compounds2 and these compounds
support topical utilization of Dorstenia rhizome prepara-
tions in the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis and
vitiligo3.
Despite the strong ethnobothanical indication concern-
ing the antiophidical properties of some Dorstenia species,
their pharmacological evaluation is still inconclusive.
However, it should be pointed out that the antiophidical
utilization of some other Brazilian medicinal plants may be
associated to the presence of widespread terpenoids (triter-
penoids and phytosterols) with venom-inactivating ac-
tion4,5. The folk indication of triterpenoid-containing plants
as “antiophidics” may also be explained by pharmacologi-
cal action related to the relief of snake bite symptoms, such
as analgesic and antiinflamatory effects. These effects may
be related to the presence of triterpenoids, as these effects
were found even in some triterpene-containing plants with
no folk indication as antiophidics6.
ln face of the above mentioned data, we have focused
the present work on the analysis of further terpenoidal
compounds from five Dorstenia species, using HRGC-MS.
This technique may be an excellent alternative to the clas-

sical phytochemical analysis procedures based on prepara-
tive-scale chromatographic isolation combined with spec-
troscopic identification, for the analysis of low-polarity
plant extracts. HRGC-MS both avoids time-consuming and
relatively expensive purification steps and gives relevant
structural information about compounds not easily identi-
fied by NMR, IR or UV7. However, in the study of medici-
nal plants, HRGC-MS is still usually restricted to the
analysis of low-polarity compounds of low molecular
weight (MW 150-250 a.m.u.) such as monoterpenes from
essential oils.
Experimental
Plant Material
Dorstenia bahiensis KL. (Moraceae) was collected and
classified by Dr. T.S. Santos, of Bahia state, Brazil. D.
bryoniifolia Mart ex. Miq. was collected at Araraquara, SP,
Brazil and classified by Dr. Jose P. Carauta, Jardim
Botânico do Rio de Janeiro. D. carautae C.C.Berg was
collected and classified by Dr. Gert Hatschbach, at Bocai-
uva do Sul, PR, Brazil. D. cayapiaa Vell. was collected and
classified by Dr. J.P.Carauta. D. heringerii Car. & Val was
collected by J. Elias de Paula (University Federal of
Brasilia, DF, Brazil) at the Reserva Ecológica- IBGE,
Brazil.
Extraction of plant material and fractionation of extracts
General
Plant material was dried at 40 °C, with forced ventila-
tion, during 3 days, before being powdered and sieved.
Only material between 0.210-0.350 mm size was utilized.
Plant material (5 g) was macerated with the solvent indi-
cated for each species, at the ratio of 1:10 (w/v), room
temperature, during 7 days. When necessary, the extracts
obtained were fractionated, as described as follows.
The hexane (Hex) fraction was obtained from the crude
extracts: the extract was filtered over active charcoal
(Reagen, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); the solvent was removed
under vacuum; the residue was shaken with hexane
(Merck), and the hexane-soluble fraction was filtrated,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (Merck) and analyzed by
HRGC.
The terpenoidal (Terp) fractions which contained
mainly triterpenes and/or steroids were obtained by silica
gel open-column preparative liquid chromatography (PLC)
of the crude plant extracts and selected by NMR (1H- or
13C-) analysis of the mixture. Since that the avaiable
amount of each hexanic extract obtained as above was very
reduced (between 10-100 mg), all the PLC procedure was
performed in reduced scale, utilizing glass Pasteur pipettes
containing around 500 mg silicagel, and around 5 mL of
each solvent for elution.
Experimental procedure for each species
D. bahiensis - the leaves were macerated with EtOAc
(Merck). The crude extract was cromatographed (PLC,
charcoal, eluted with CH2Cl2 and EtOH, sucessively). The
ethanolic fraction was further submitted to PLC (silica gel,
0.063-0.200 mm, Merck, elution with toluene, toluene-
EtOAc 1: 1 and EtOAc, sucessively).
D. bryoniifolia - the rhizomes were macerated with
hexane. The crude extract was directly analyzed by HRGC.
D. carautae - the whole plant was macerated with
EtOAc. The Hex fraction was obtained as described above
(General)
D. cayapiaa - the leaves were macerated with CHCl3-
EtOH 1:1 (v/v). The Hex fraction was obtained as de-
scribed above.
D. heringerii - the leaves were macerated with hexane.
The crude extract was chromatographed (PLC, silicagel,
elution with hexane, hexane-EtOAc 1:1 and EtOAc, suces-
sively).
Chromatographic analysis
HRGC-MS analysis were performed by using a HP
5970 MSD, with electron impact ionization (70 eV) cou-
pled to a HP 5890 GC. The column used was a cross-linked
5% phenyl, 95% methylsilicone HP-5 (25 m x 0.2 mm x
0.33 µm), furnished by Hewlett-Packard, U.S.A.. Samples
were injected using the split mode (split ratio 1:30), with
injector temperature and GC-MS interface temperature
both at 280 °C. Column temperature was programmed from
150 °C (2 min), at 8 °C/min to 290 °C (held during 20 min).
Hydrogen was used as carrier gas. MS scan range was 50
to 500 a.m.u.. Data were processed on a HP 7946/HP
9000-300 CPU.
HRGC-FID analysis were performed on a HP 5890 GC,
using the same column with the same temperature pro-
gramming utilized for HRGC-MS analysis. Detector tem-
perature was 290 °C, and data were obtained on a HP
3396A integrator. Hydrogen was utilized as carrier gas, at
the average linear velocity of 40 cm/s.
Analysis of fatty acids
Fatty acids were identified by HRGC-MS as their
methyl esters, after esterification with diazomethane of the
fractions containing these compounds.
ldentification of the chemical constituents
Identifications were made by comparison of retention
times, obtained at identical chromatographic conditions of
the analyzed samples and authentic standards or by co-in-
jection. In both cases, chromatographic data were consid-
ered together with the comparison of MS data with those
from authentic standards, obtained at similar ionization
conditions (EI, 70 eV) in our laboratory. Tentative identi-
530 Vilegas et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
fications were made by analysis of the fragmentation data,
comparison with literature MS data8,9,10 and computer
search in the NBS library.
Results and Discussion
HRGC-MS was applied both to the analysis of crude
extracts and of fractions obtained from PLC. For the analy-
sis of crude extracts, due to the presence of more polar
compounds, only the hexane-soluble compounds were ana-
lyzed, since this solvent can selectively extract compounds
appropriate to GC analysis, including low-functionalized
steroids and triterpenoids. Despite a relatively longer
analysis time, preliminary work with standards showed that
derivatization of the triterpene and steroid alcohols is not
essential, with the advantage of allowing direct comparison
with literature data of underivatized compounds9.

Figure 1. Chemical structure of the compounds detected by HRGC-MS in Dorstenia samples.
The HRGC-MS -TIC profile of the Dorstenia crude
extracts showed some similarity between the chemical
pattern of leaves and rhizomes, even from different species:
the furocoumarins are eluted first, followed by the steroids,
while the triterpenes are eluted later. FID integration of the
peaks indicated a predominance of the furocoumarins over
the aliphatic compounds.
HRGC-MS-TIC allowed identifying several com-
pounds from Dorstenia samples (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The
chemical composition of all Dorstenia samples herein ex-
amined showed to be very similar (Table 1), and some of
the identified compounds have already been reported from
other Dorstenia species2. All the triterpenes were found in
small amounts (yield from vegetal material: 0,1% or less).
The procedure herein adopted limited the scope of the
compounds analyzed to the less polar constituents. More
highly funtionalized or polar molecules such as syriogenin,
which was previously found in D. contrajerva11 might not
be detected, due to the selective extraction of low-polarity
compounds and also due to the lower volatility of the polar
compounds; the knowledge of this limitation is important
for the final option for HRGC-MS analysis. Therefore, we
are studying the more polar compounds from Dorstenia
hydroalcoholic extracts by using conventional procedures.
Identification of the compounds
The prenylated derivative of bergapten, 1d, was found
only in D. bahiensis. Its identity was confirmed by com-
parison of retention time and MS data with those of an
authentic sample isolated from D. cayapiaa12.
Using only MS data, it was not possible to identify the
furocoumarins 1a-c and 2a-b, due to the similarity of the
fragmentation patterns of the linear and angular isomers.
Their identification also required comparison with tR data
of authentic samples of some furocoumarins using the same
chromatographic conditions as in this work.
Most of the triterpenes found belong to the oleanane/ur-
sane series, characterized by a base peak at m/z = 2189.
Unequivocal differentiation between α and β-amyrin re-
quired co-injection with authentic samples, since these
triterpenes have very similar MS spectra (in the chroma-
tographic conditions utilized, β-amyrin elutes first). In the
operational conditions of the MSD system utilized in this
work, α- and β-amyrin could be differentiated by exami-
nation of the relative intensities of the peaks at m/z 189 and
203: β-amyrin has a m/z 203 peak around twice the inten-
sity of the m/z 189 peak, while α-amyrin spectra shows
both peaks with similar intensity.
ln the hexane extract of D. bryoniifolia, two triterpenes
were found with base peaks at m/z 218, but both with a peak
at m/z 424, supposed to be the molecular peak, instead of
m/z = 426 as in the case of α- and β-amyrin. Exchange of
an hydroxy group for a keto group leads to a decrease of
molecular weight and polarity, which leads to a lower tR in
the column utilized for the HRGC analysis of these com-
pounds. Besides, MS spectra of these compounds shows a
peak at m/z 205, due to the fragmentation of a 3-keto-sys-
tem involving rings A to C, and at m/z= 203, corresponding
to the fragment originating from methyl loss of the diene
portion originated from retro Diels-Alder fragmentation of
a ∆12-unsaturated oleanane or ursane9. With these data, they
were tentatively identified as being α- or β-amyrone (3e-f).
Final identification was made by using α- and β-amyrin
fragmentation as models: in the keto compounds, a differ-
ence was also observed in the relative intensity of the peaks
at m/z = 189 and 203, which originate from further frag-
mentation of the m/z = 218 ion, the latter indicating the
C-ring opening of a D,C-unsubstituted ∆12-oleanene or
ursene9. ln an analogous way to α- and β-amyrin, we have
assigned the compound with the more intense m/z = 203
peak as being β-amyrone (3f) and the α-amyrone structure
(3e) was assigned to the compound with m/z = 189 and 203
peaks with similar intensity. Chromatographic data also
supports these assignments, since the peak corresponding
to 3e in the TIC has a lower tR than 3f in the same elution
sequence as for the 3-OH terpenes.

Glutinol acetate was identified by analysis of its frag-
mentation data and comparison with an authentic sample
of simiarenol, isolated from Dorstenia asaroides13. Despite
the lupane-type ring E of the latter, which leads to some
characteristic peaks related to the isopropyl group, both
glutinol and simiarenol have great similarities in their MS
spectra due to the similar structure of rings A to D14, the
most important feature being the base peak at m/z 274,
followed by a (274-Me) peak at m/z 259, which charac-
terizes ∆5-unsaturated skeleta10.
Taraxerol acetate was identified only by MS, mainly
due to the base peak at m/z 204, which  originates from
rings D and E of an ∆14-taraxerene. Another important peak
is m/z 344, which originates from a retro Diels-Alder
decomposition with ring-D opening and confirms both the
unsaturation and the presence of an acetoxy group at C-39.
The other triterpenes which are not discussed herein
were identified by co-injection with authentic samples;
other compounds were identified by direct comparison of
MS and tR data with authentic standards (sitosterol, si-
tosterone, α-tocopherol) or by chromatographic data, con-
firmed by interpretation of MS fragmentation (fatty acids,
analyzed as their methyl esters). Some significant MS data
of the identified compounds from Dorstenia are listed in
Table 2.

fied tentatively as a steroid, requires further MS studies,
possibly by using soft ionization techniques (not available

in our laboratory during the present work), since this com-
pound is present at a very low level, which prevents its
isolation through usual phytochemical procedures.
Figure 2 shows a typical chromatographic profile from
dechlorophyllated crude Dorstenia extracts. The extracts
obtained from the leaves require a clean-up procedure for
removal of the chlorophylls (filtration over active charcoal,
described in Experimental), while the crude extracts ob-
tained from the rhizomes could be directly analyzed by
HRGC-MS. ln a previous work we have shown that SFE-
CO2 (supercritical fluid extraction using CO2) also fur-
nishes rhizome extracts suitable  for direct analysis15.
The TIC-MS data obtained from the Hex-fraction and
from the Terp-fractions were almost the same for the
terpenoidal compounds (Fig. 3), and the identification of
most of the triterpenes and steroids was possible even in
Hex-fraction. As the Terp-fractions required more isola-
tion steps (with greater consumption of solvents and silica
gel adsorvent) than the Hex-fractions, the HRGC-MS
analysis of a crude dechlorophyllated hexane extract from
Dorstenia samples is sufficient to obtain  relevant informa-
tion concerning their chemical composition. The utilization
of small amounts of plant material is very important in the
case of Dorstenia genus, since the analysis of the rhizomes
(the most valuable part of these plants, according to folk
medicine indications) leads to the destruction of the plant,
and the native Dorstenia population is diminishing in Bra-
zil.
Conclusions
Bergapten, as well as the triterpenes β-amyrin and
sitosterol, have already been associated with the snake-
venom inactivating action of some Brazilian medicinal
plants5. Thus, the utilization of Dorstenia plants as anti-
ophidicals may be inferred to be both due to a venom-inac-
tivating action and to analgesic and antiinflamatory
properties of the several triterpenes. These results also pose
the question if biologically-guided fractionation is an ap-
propriate procedure in the search for the active compounds
of medicinal plants such as those of Dorstenia genus, since
these active molecules may be minor compounds, with
small and/or non-specific pharmacological actions when
studied as isolated compounds.
HRGC-MS has proved to be a very powerful tool
affording both the separation and the individual charac-
terization of isomers which could not to be separated by
conventional PLC procedures. Further to the preliminar
report of some of the data herein presented16, a paper
concerning the analysis of triterpenes from Brazilian Poly-
podiaceae was published, but with the aid of preparative
purification steps and chemical transformations, for obten-
tion of reference samples of some triterpenes not found
commercially17.
In the screening of medicinal plants from the same
genus, which often requires the analysis of many species
with similar chemical composition (as in the case of Dor-
stenia genus), and specially in the particular case of the
pentacyclic triterpenes, MS data furnish a fast differentia-
tion among important skeleta, some of them with potential
biological interest.
