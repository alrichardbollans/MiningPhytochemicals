Key words: Arabidopsis thaliana mutant,
nucleoside degradation, nucleotide meta-
bolism, uridine nucleosidase, xanthosine
nucleosidase.
Summary
• A central step in nucleoside and nucleobase salvage pathways is the hydrolysis
of nucleosides to their respective nucleobases. In plants this is solely accomplished
by nucleosidases (EC 3.2.2.x).
• To elucidate the importance of nucleosidases for nucleoside degradation,
general metabolism, and plant growth, thorough phenotypic and biochemical
analyses were performed using Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion mutants
lacking expression of the previously identiﬁed genes annotated as uridine ribo-
hydrolases (URH1 and URH2).
• Comprehensive functional analyses of single and double mutants demonstrated
that both isoforms are unimportant for seedling establishment and plant growth,
while one participates in uridine degradation. Rather unexpectedly, nucleoside and
nucleotide proﬁling and nucleosidase activity screening of soluble crude extracts
revealed a deﬁciency of xanthosine and inosine hydrolysis in the single mutants,
with substantial accumulation of xanthosine in one of them. Mixing of the two
mutant extracts, and by in vitro activity reconstitution using a mixture of recombi-
nant URH1 and URH2 proteins, both restored activity, thus providing biochemical
evidence that at least these two isoforms are needed for inosine and xanthosine
hydrolysis.
• This mutant study demonstrates the utility of in vivo systems for the examina-
tion of metabolic activities, with the discovery of the new substrate xanthosine and
elucidation of a mechanism for expanding the nucleosidase substrate spectrum.
Introduction
Nucleotides and nucleic acids were among the ﬁrst sponta-
neously synthesized biomolecules (Powner et al., 2009),
and they play an important role in evolution, information
preserving and catalytic activity (Joyce, 2002). While nucle-
otides are important intermediates in nucleic acid synthesis
and energy metabolism, nucleotide sugars are necessary for
storage compound biosynthesis and for the synthesis of
structure-building compounds such as cellulose. In addi-
tion, purine nucleotides are involved in signal transduction
and are components of cofactors participating in enzymatic
reactions (e.g. NAD, FAD and CoA).
As an evolutionarily ancient and indispensable complex
of metabolic pathways, the metabolism of both classes of
nucleotides in plants is comparable to that in other organ-
isms (Moffatt & Ashihara, 2002; Zrenner et al., 2006). It
starts with the formation of central metabolites, while all
purines are derived from IMP (van der Graaff et al., 2004)
and all pyrimidines from UMP (Giermann et al., 2002;
Schro ¨der et al., 2005). The whole range of nucleotides is
then generated by amination, desamination and oxidation
of the heterocyclic ring system.
There are also central pathways for degradation, with all
pyrimidines being degraded via the nucleoside uridine, and
all purines via the nucleobase xanthine. Thus, xanthine
dehydrogenase is the bottleneck in purine degradation
(Hesberg et al., 2004). Reducing the capacity of xanthine
dehydrogenase causes severe phenotypes such as growth
retardation, early senescence and infertility (Nakagawa

olism has revealed that the role of pyrimidine degradation
in growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana is of
only minor importance (Zrenner et al., 2009). Mutants of
pyrimidine degradation unable to catabolize [2-
14C]-uracil
did not show any difference from wild type when grown
under standard growth conditions.
Compared with de novo synthesis, the salvage pathways
provide an energy-saving recycling mechanism, where
nucleosides or nucleobases are converted into the respective
nucleotides. Nucleoside kinase activity and nucleobase phos-
phoribosyltransferase activity have been demonstrated for a
variety of plants (Ashihara et al., 2000; Katahira & Ashihara,
2002; Loukanina et al., 2008). Mutants deﬁcient in adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase are male sterile (Gaillard et al.,
1998), while A. thaliana mutants affected in different uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase genes display phenotypes of vary-
ing severity (Islam et al., 2007; Mainguet et al., 2009). In
addition, increased availability of the co-substrate phospho-
ribosylpyrophosphate in the cytosol leads to enhanced
uracil salvage and higher biomass accumulation in plants
(Koslowsky et al., 2008), thus demonstrating the importance
of salvage reactions. To date, no mutant plants with altered
uridine kinase activity have been reported, but mutants lack-
ing adenosine kinase show developmental abnormalities and
reduced transmethylation (Moffatt et al., 2002).
While in animals interconversion of nucleosides and
nucleobases is catalyzed by phosphorylases (EC 2.4.2.x), in
plants only nucleosidase activity (EC 3.2.2.x) has been dem-
onstrated (Katahira & Ashihara, 2002, 2006). Therefore,
plants can be used as a superior research tool for functional
analyses of nucleosidase activities. Recently, the importance
of nucleoside hydrolysis has been rediscovered (Riewe et al.,
2008), and an A. thaliana enzyme catalyzing uridine hydro-
lysis was heterologously expressed by Jung et al. (2009). It
carries the N-terminal ﬁnger print motif and additional
sequence characteristics common to all nucleoside hydro-
lases (Versees & Steyaert, 2003). Transformants with
altered expression of this nucleoside hydrolase indicate that
this protein plays a crucial role in uridine degradation.
Therefore, knock-out mutants with a complete loss of this
protein may provide important insights into the salvage of
pyrimidines. Other nucleoside-degrading enzymes have
been puriﬁed and characterized from various plant species
(Campos et al., 2005; Szuwart et al., 2006), but their
genetic background is still unknown.
This work focuses on the investigation of mutant plants
as a tool for functional analyses of nucleosidase activities
to elucidate their importance for nucleoside degradation,
general metabolism and plant growth. A thorough in planta
biochemical investigation demonstrates the utility of this
in vivo system for the study of metabolic activities, with the
discovery of the new substrate xanthosine and elucidation
of a mechanism for expanding the substrate spectrum.
Materials and Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh Columbia-0 (Col),
SALK_083120 (URH1) and SALK_128723 (URH2) were
obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre
(University of Nottingham, Loughborough, UK). Seeds
were surface-sterilized and aseptically grown on half-strength
MS medium including vitamins (Murashige & Skoog,
1962), 0.5% sucrose and 0.7% agar. Seeds were imbibed at
4 C in darkness (48 h) and grown in a 12-h photoperiod
(photon ﬂux density 100 lmol m
)2 s
)1;2 1  C light; 18 C
dark). After 3 wk, seedlings were transferred to soil and
grown under a 8-h photoperiod (photon ﬂux density
150 lmol m
)2 s
)1;20 C light; 16 C dark).
Determination of nucleoside hydrolase activity
Frozen plant material was powdered using a ball mill
(Retsch, Haan, Germany). Then 100 mg of frozen material
was mixed with 200 ll of cold extraction buffer (50 mM
Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT)
and kept at 4 C. The homogenate was centrifuged
(11 000 g for 5 min) and the supernatant was desalted on
spin columns using Sephadex G-25 ﬁne (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Nu ¨mbrecht, Germany) with a 3-ml bed
size equilibrated with 50 mM NaH2PO4⁄Na2HPO4 (pH
7.5). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) and was 0.9 to
1.8 mg of soluble protein per g fresh weight for roots, and
3.5 to 5 mg of soluble protein per g fresh weight for leaves.
Four time-points in the linear range of product formation
(0, 5, 10 and 20 min) were used for each single activity
determination, as follows: 35 ll of supernatant (10–100 lg
of soluble protein) was added to 35 ll of reaction buffer
(50 mM NaH2PO4⁄Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5) and 10–
5000 lM nucleoside) and incubated at 30 C. Reactions
were stopped by adding 20 ll of 16% trichloracetic acid.
After neutralization with 3 ll of 10 M KOH and removal
of the precipitate by centrifugation, the produced nucleo-
bases were quantiﬁed by ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC
(Zrenner et al., 2009). For quantiﬁcation of the residual
activity, the pellet of the centrifuged homogenate was mixed
with the initial amount of 50 mM NaH2PO4⁄Na2HPO4
(pH 7.5) and activity was determined as described above,
while a shaker was used during the incubation procedure.

transferred into A. thaliana protoplasts (Yoo et al., 2007).

scope Leica DM IRB at 488 nm (cytosolic control, beta-

moter-driven expression of the ﬁrst 80 amino acids of

et al.,2002)wasusedasmitochondrialcontrol.
Recombinant protein expression, puriﬁcation and
activity determination
Over-expression was achieved using single colonies of
freshly transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). To
reduce the formation of inclusion bodies, 150 ml of unin-
duced overnight culture was diluted with 350 ml of fresh
LB and cultivated at room temperature. When bacteria
optical density OD600 reached 1.2, protein expression was
induced with 0.5 mM Isopropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyrano-
side (IPTG) for a maximum of 3 h at room temperature.
Recombinant proteins were puriﬁed using standard proce-
dures with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 mM
Phenylmethanesulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF) and Ni-nitrilotri-
acetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) agarose under nondenaturing
conditions (QIAexpressionist; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
To obtain better puriﬁcation results, 50 mM imidazol was
included in the washing solution and recombinant proteins
of the second eluate containing 300 mM imidazol were
used in activity testing. While URH1 could be easily iso-
lated with this procedure from soluble bacterial extracts,
some of the URH2 proteins were always found in the insol-
uble residue after induction and extraction. However, the
results obtained for URH2 using this procedure were better
than those obtained using a variety of other protocols.
Activity measurements were performed using desalted eluate
fractions as described above with the respective nucleoside
at 200 lM. For the URH1 + URH2 mixture, equal
amounts of puriﬁed and desalted eluate fractions represent-
ing equimolar amounts of URH1 and URH2 were mixed.
Isolation of mutants
Plants were obtained from the Salk collection (Alonso et al.,
2003). Screening and selection within mutant populations
were carried out following the Signal Salk instructions
(http://signal.salk.edu). Genomic DNA was isolated by a
standard procedure using phenol-chloroform extraction
from third-generation plants. PCR genotyping was per-
formed using T-DNA LB-speciﬁc primers and gene-speciﬁc
primer pairs of oligos urh1 left, 5¢-TGCTCGCAAA-
TGAACTATCG; urh1 right, 5¢-ACAGACCCAGGAATT
GGTGA; urh2 left, 5¢-ACCAAAACTTCCCTCCACCT;
urh2 right, 5¢-GCTAGTTTGTCCTTGTCATCAG; and
SALK LBb, 5¢-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT.
Homozygous mutants were isolated from selfed populations
of the respective mutant. The sites of T-DNA insertions
were veriﬁed by sequencing of border regions. Gene knock-
out was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated
using NucleoSpin Plant II (Macherey-Nagel, Du ¨ren,
Germany) and single-strand cDNA was synthesized using
SuperScript III RNaseH
) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen
GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). Quantitative real-time PCR
was performed for URH1 using SYBR  Green and
StepOnePlus System (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany) and a temperature proﬁle of 95 C for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 60 s.
cDNA for urh2 mutants was used as a PCR template with a
temperature proﬁle of 95 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles
of 95 C for 30 s, 58 C for 30 s and 74 C for 1 min.
Metabolite analyses
Trichloroacetic acid⁄ether extracts from frozen powdered
material were made and nucleotides and nucleotide sugars
were measured by anion-exchange HPLC (Schro ¨der et al.,
2005). Nucleosides and nucleobases were analyzed by ion-
pair reversed-phase HPLC (Zrenner et al., 2009). Unpaired
two-tailed t-tests were used to compare pooled data from
different types of material.
[
14C]-nucleoside metabolism
All tracer experiments were performed aseptically with
whole plants. Seeds were surface-sterilized, imbibed for 2 d
at 4 C and transferred to solid low-nitrogen medium
(0.6 mM KH2PO4⁄K2HPO4 (pH 5.8), 0.75 mM MgSO4,
1.5 mM CaCl2, 9.8 mM KCl, 0.1 mM KNO3, 0.1 mM
NH4NO3, micronutrients and vitamins according to
Murashige & Skoog (1962) and 0.7% agar), at one seed per
12-ml Petri dish. Plants were grown for 6 wk under a 12-h
photoperiod. For feeding, 500 ll (0.5 lCi) of

was spread on the agar surface and each open plate was
placed in a gastight box (Phytatray; Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany) together with a 3MM Whatman ﬁlter
paper soaked with 700 ll of 4M KOH. The incubation
proceeded in the dark with one exchange of the ﬁlter after
24 h. After 48 h, plants were washed three times with water
to remove possible surface contamination. After fresh

and powdered using a ball mill. Radiolabeled metabolites
were extracted from 250 to 580 mg of material by homoge-
nization in 500 ll of cold 10% perchloric acid containing
10 mM EGTA for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at
11 000 g and 4 C for 5 min, the supernatant was removed
and kept. The pellet was washed twice with 150 ll of 10%
perchloric acid, and then all three supernatants were com-
bined and neutralized using 5 M KOH containing 1 M
triethanolamine. This supernatant fraction (supernatant1)
contained unmetabolized nucleosides, catabolic pathway
intermediates, nucleotides and nucleotide sugars, whereas
the remaining pellet contained the insoluble DNA and
RNA together with cell wall material and proteins. In cer-
tain cases, this pellet fraction was incubated for 20 h with
500 ll of 0.3 M KOH at 37 C with shaking based on a
protocol of Ashihara (1977). After centrifugation at
11 000 g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and kept.
The pellet was washed with 100 ll of 0.3 M KOH, and
both KOH supernatants were combined and neutralized
(supernatant2). This supernatant2 fraction contained label
that had been incorporated in the RNA. Radioactivity
from the ﬁlter was eluted for 48 h in 7 ml of water.
Radioactivity was determined using an LS6500 Multi-
Purpose Scintillation Counter and Ready Safe scintillation
cocktail (Beckman-Coulter, Krefeld, Germany).
Results and Discussion
Nucleoside metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana
Ribonucleoside hydrolase activity was quantiﬁed in crude
extracts of roots and leaves by determination of uracil,
hypoxanthine or xanthine originating from added uridine,
inosine or xanthosine, respectively. Further degradation of
nucleobases was not observed, presumably because of miss-
ing cofactors in the enzyme assays. Evaluation of the in vivo
kinetic properties of total soluble nucleosidase activities was
performed with extracts of leaf tissue by applying increasing
substrate concentrations until no further increase in reaction
rate was observed. In this way, Michaelis constants (KM)
of 200 lM for uridine and inosine and 60 lM for xantho-
sine were determined with a Lineweaver–Burk plot
(Supporting Information Fig. S1). For all subsequent analy-
ses, substrate concentrations at these KM values were used.
The highest total nucleosidase capacity was found in
extracts of roots for all tested substrates. Less than
8 pkat mg
)1 soluble proteins for each substrate was measur-
able in leaves (Fig. 1a).
The similar in vivo KM values for the three tested sub-
strates indicate comparable speciﬁcities of nucleoside
hydrolases for their pyrimidine and purine substrates. In all
cases, the determined KM values were at least 40 times
higher than the respective concentrations found in different
plant tissues (Table 1). However, the observed KM of
200 lM for uridine is still lower than that reported for
mung bean (Vigna radiata), which is 1 mM (Achar &
Vaidyanathan, 1967). Some legumes are suspected to have
a higher nucleoside metabolism, as they produce secondary
metabolites from pyrimidines (Brown & Turan, 1995).
Nevertheless, the total capacity of uridine hydrolase in
A. thaliana is comparable to that detected in these legume
seedlings (53–82 pkat mg
)1 protein).
Nucleoside hydrolase isoforms of A. thaliana
Using the protein sequences of the three ribonucleoside hy-
drolases RihA, RihB, and RihC of E. coli (Petersen &
Møller, 2001) and the BLASTP algorithm, we identiﬁed no

www.newphytologist.comURH1 (Kurtz et al., 2002; Jung et al., 2009). The genes are
annotated as uridine ribohydrolases AtURH1 (At2g36310)
and AtURH2 (At1g05620), and show only 49% sequence
identity to each other. Both sequences contain typical
features of the superfamily of nucleoside hydrolases (Versees
& Steyaert, 2003; National Center for Biotechnology
Information Conserved Domain Database (NCBI CDD)
identiﬁer: cd00455): the N-terminal cluster of Asp residues
(DXDXXXDD motif), one additional conserved Asp
residue and one conserved Thr residue for binding of cofac-
tor Ca
2+ (Degano et al., 1996), and the His residue, which
acts as a proton donor for the nucleobase product (Gopaul
et al.,1996)(Fig. S2).Standardpredictionsoftwareclassiﬁes
URH1 and URH2 as cytosolic proteins. This was conﬁrmed
by transformation of A. thaliana protoplasts with URH
fusionstoGFP,andsubsequentdetectionofbothproteinsin
the cytosol (Fig. 1b). Publicly available gene expression data
from the AtGenExpress effort (Schmid et al., 2005) show
high abundances of both URH transcripts in root tissue
(Fig. S3). This pattern closely reﬂects the distribution of uri-
dine, inosine, and xanthosine nucleosidase activity measured
indifferentorgansoftheA. thalianaplants(Fig. 1a).
One possible explanation for a relatively high abundance
of nucleoside hydrolases in roots is that nucleosides are pres-
ent in the soil and may represent a valuable nitrogen and
carbon source for heterotrophic plant roots. Phillips et al.
(1997) showed, for example, a high uridine content of
c. 600 nmol g
)1 in nonagricultural soil. This is 130 times
higher than uridine contents in A. thaliana roots. With the
help of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (Li et al., 2003), the
extracellular nucleosides may be taken up and used as sub-
strates in salvage reactions in the cytosol of the root cells.
Phenotypic analysis of all URH knock-out mutants
To assess the in vivo importance of uridine hydrolase, we
used A. thaliana lines with T-DNA insertions in either the
URH1 or the URH2 gene, which were selected for homo-
zygosity. The T-DNA insertions were conﬁrmed by
sequencing ﬂanking regions and absence of expression of the
respective URH gene has been proved (Fig. S4). According
to The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Release 9,
the T-DNA insertion in URH1 is on chromosome 2, loca-
tion 15226135, in the second intron of eight, several
hundred bases downstream on the chromosome, as anno-
tated. The T-DNA insertion in URH2 is on chromosome 1,
location 1680830, in the sixth intron of eight, as annotated.
No visible phenotype was observed among homozygous sin-
gle mutants when they were grown either aseptically on full
nutrition medium or on soil (Fig. 2a). Also, homozygous
urh1 urh2 and urh2 urh1 double mutants showed no visible
differences in growth and development compared with wild-
type A. thaliana (URH) (Fig. 2b).
In contrast to Jung et al. (2009), who reported delayed
germination using an artiﬁcial microRNA (amiRNA)
approach speciﬁc for URH1, we found no alterations in

mutants, or in the urh double mutants. Furthermore, plant
growth and development were unaffected in all knock-out
lines compared with the wild type under standardized
growth conditions (Fig. 2). As it was shown previously that
A. thaliana miRNAs and also amiRNAs have a very narrow
action spectrum and target only mRNAs with few mis-
matches (Schwag et al., 2006), we can only speculate
whether there are further effects in the 35S:amiAtURH1
transformants of Jung et al. Nevertheless, our careful screen-
ing of mutants with complete knock-out of both URH
genes clearly demonstrates that neither URH1 nor URH2
represents a key regulator. Furthermore, the urh double
mutants indicate that either nucleoside hydrolysis is meta-
bolically unimportant or there are other enzymes present to
take over the URH function.
Plant nucleosidases may also catalyze the conversion of
cytokinin riboside to its active form, the cytokinin base
(Chen & Kristopeit, 1981). However, studies in rice (Oryza
sativa) indicate that gradients of active cytokinins are gener-
ated by phosphoribohydrolase activity (Kurakawa et al.,
2007). Furthermore, it has been shown that reduced active
cytokinins cause enhanced root growth (Werner et al.,
2010). As plant growth and development were unaffected
in all knock-out lines, a relationship between URH and
cytokinin metabolism does not seem very likely.
Nucleoside contents in URH knock-out mutants
To investigate the distribution of metabolites along the reac-
tion chain from the nucleobases to nucleotide sugars, we
quantiﬁed all intermediates in roots and leaves of wild-type
and mutant plants using HPLC (Table 1). Nucleoside con-
tents were low in wild-type tissues, with inosine and
xanthosine concentrations below the detection limit. The
uracil content in the wild type was 1 nmol g
)1 fresh weight,
while hypoxanthine and xanthine were below the detection
limit. The predominant nucleotides were UDP glucose
(UDPG) and the multiple phosphorylated nucleosides UDP
and UTP, while IMP and XMP were below the detection
limit. All other adenine and guanosine intermediates (nucle-
otides, nucleosides and nucleobases) were unchanged and
are not shown. Together with uracil, uridine contributed to
< 10% of the total soluble pyrimidine pool in the organs
examined. One possible reason for thelow contents ofnucle-
osides and nucleobases is active salvage to channel them
directly to pools of phosphorylated pathway intermediates;
another is active degradation. In addition, many nucleotides
arising from nucleic acid turnover (UMP) and carbohydrate
synthesis (UDP) may not attain the unphosphorylated state,
but are readily rephosphorylated by several kinases (Zhou
et al.,1998; Lange et al., 2008).
When compared with the wild-type, there was a highly
signiﬁcant enlargement of the uridine pool in the roots of
urh1 mutants (Table 1). Also, pool sizes of other pyrimidine
metabolites increased signiﬁcantly. The second predicted
substrate of this class of nucleoside hydrolase, inosine, did
not accumulate. However, the content of another purine
nucleoside, xanthosine, increased substantially to pool sizes
of 576 nmol g
)1 fresh weight in the roots of urh1. None of
the measured intermediates accumulated in urh2 mutants
(Table 1), while roots of double mutants showed the same
accumulation pattern as urh1 mutants (Table 1). As metab-
olism of purines and that of pyrimidines follow distinct

www.newphytologist.compathways, the xanthosine accumulation was probably not a
consequence of pyrimidine accumulation but of impaired
xanthosine hydrolysis. These ﬁndings clearly demonstrate
that xanthosine also has to be considered as a substrate of
plant enzymes annotated asuridine hydrolases.
Nucleoside hydrolytic activities in URH knock-out
mutants
Nucleoside hydrolytic activities were measured with uri-
dine, inosine and also xanthosine as substrates. Uridine
hydrolase capacity was signiﬁcantly reduced in soluble
extracts of roots and leaves of urh1, thus conﬁrming its role
as the major uridine nucleosidase in A. thaliana. Loss of
URH2 did not signiﬁcantly affect the uridine hydrolytic
capacity of roots or leaves of A. thaliana plants, while in
double mutants almost no uridine hydrolytic activity could
be found in roots (Fig. 3).
When the purine nucleosides inosine and xanthosine
were used as substrates, both hydrolase activities were con-
siderably decreased in soluble extracts of each of the
mutants (Fig. 3). This shows, for the ﬁrst time, that URH1
is not only needed for uridine degradation, but may also be
directly involved in purine hydrolysis. This also indicates
that URH2 has to be considered as a purine hydrolase
rather than a uridine hydrolase. In addition, the remaining
nucleoside hydrolytic capacity in roots of the double
mutants (Fig. 3) suggests the existence of another as yet
unidentiﬁed hydrolase. As already discussed (Jung et al.,
2009), there is one other gene coding for a putative func-
tional nucleoside hydrolase present in the A. thaliana
genome (At5g18860). This gene probably codes for a dual
domain protein whose translation product was found in the
cell wall proteome. Thus it is more likely to be a candidate
for the cell wall-bound adenosine nucleosidase (Riewe
et al., 2008), that would be found in the residue of our
enzyme extract.
Nucleoside uptake and metabolism in URH knock-out
mutants
To further assess the in vivo importance of soluble nucleo-
side hydrolytic activities, feeding studies with [2-
14C]-
uridine, [8-
14C]-inosine and [8-
14C]-xanthosine were per-
formed in the wild type and mutants. The plants were
grown aseptically on solid medium, and nucleosides were
administered to the roots to closely resemble natural situa-
tions. Radioactivity of all used substrates was readily
incorporated at comparable rates (Fig. 4a). This was proba-
bly attributable to the uptake system itself, as nucleoside
transporters are present and accept purine and pyrimidine
substrates (Li et al., 2003; Wormit et al., 2004). Although
uridine and xanthosine were increased in all organs of urh1
mutant plants (Table 1), there was no signiﬁcant difference
in uptake. This shows that augmented nucleoside contents
do not restrict further uptake. It may also hint at sequestra-
tion of nucleosides in different cellular compartments; for
example, the vacuole. Analyses of subcellular metabolite
accumulation would clarify this, but this question is not
addressed in the present analysis. Additionally, in the stud-
ies carried out, we cannot exclude the possibility of
extracellular nucleoside hydrolysis, and the possibility that
unlabeled ribose and the respective nucleobase were taken
up and further metabolized.

www.newphytologist.comWhen uridinewasfedtoA. thalianaplantroots,c.30%of
the uptake was degraded and released as CO2, while c. 20%
was salvaged and integrated into the nucleic acid fraction
(Fig. 4b). Comparison of the wild type with mutant plants
revealed a signiﬁcant reduction of CO2 production from fed
uridine in urh1 mutants. While uridine catabolism to CO2
in urh1 was reduced by half, no changes were observed in
urh2singlemutants,andalsonofurthersigniﬁcantreduction
of uridine catabolism below the level of urh1 was found in
the double mutants (46% of the wild-type level). Thus, the
remaining capacity for uridine hydrolysis in the double
mutants was sufﬁcient to accomplish 46% of uridine degra-
dation under in vivo conditions. This clearly demonstrates
thatneitherURHisakeyregulatorofuridinedegradation.
The increased pool sizes of uridylates and UDP glucose
in roots of urh1 mutants (Table 1) indicate enhanced
uridine salvage, starting with uridine kinase and followed
by further phosphorylations. These increased pools might
be the reason for the presumably reduced incorporation
into nucleic acids in the urh1 mutant (Fig. 4b), but it is
more likely a consequence of diluting effects and reduced
speciﬁc activity in the respective pools.
When inosine and xanthosine were fed to A. thaliana
plant roots, c. 19% of the inosine uptake and an astonishing
14% of the xanthosine uptake were integrated into the
insoluble fraction (Fig. 4c). As they were supplied as
[8-
14C]-inosine and [8-
14C]-xanthosine, the label in the
insoluble fraction can be regarded as salvaged nucleotides
that are integrated into nucleic acids. To date, incorpora-
tion of xanthosine into nucleic acids has not been found in
potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber slices (Katahira &
Ashihara, 2006), leaves of cacao (Theobroma cacao)
(Koyama et al., 2003), or tea seedlings (Camellia sinensis)
(Deng & Ashihara, 2010), but it should be kept in mind
that previous feeding studies always used excised tissue,
whereas our set-up resembled the natural situation. Further
separation of the insolubles revealed main labeling in the
KOH hydrolysable fraction, which is RNA. This shows for
the ﬁrst time that A. thaliana plants are able to salvage xan-
thosine, at least to a certain extent.
In contrast with [2-
14C]-uridine, [8-
14C]-inosine and
[8-
14C]-xanthosine degradation does not entail immediate
14CO2 release. In fact, radioactivity will remain in soluble
degradation intermediates such as allantoate, ureidoglycine
and ureidoglycolate, and only from a very small proportion
of these is
14CO2 produced (Fig. 4c). These differences in
nucleoside metabolism between purines and pyrimidines
may be a result of their partially different functions in the plant.
While both are building blocks of nucleic acids, an active
and efﬁcient recycling of the purine adenosine is very impor-
tant for primary metabolism in transmethylation reactions.
Inosine and xanthosine metabolism was unchanged in
both urh1 and urh2, while the levels of degradation to CO2
were fairly low (2% of uptake). It is known from a few plant
studies that purine degradation may occur via the formation
of xanthosine, either by deamination of guanosine or by
dephosphorylation of XMP, and subsequent hydrolysis to
xanthine. Xanthine may also be built from hypoxanthine or
guanine (Fig. S5). The relative contributions of these reac-
tions to salvage and degradation depend on the analyzed
material (Ashihara et al., 1997; Katahira & Ashihara,
2006). As inosine and xanthosine hydrolytic capacity is
greatly reduced in soluble protein extracts of urh1 and urh2
mutants and only xanthosine accumulates, these plants
presumably perform active inosine salvage and purine deg-
radation by guanine deaminase. As urh mutants are able to
metabolize inosine and xanthosine and do not show pheno-
typic differences, no substantial reduction of purine
degradation is assumed, as this would cause visible changes
in growth and development (Nakagawa et al., 2007).
These results strongly suggest the presence of other
enzymes to take over URH function, such as the above-
mentioned cell wall-bound adenosine nucleosidase (Riewe
et al., 2008). Therefore, analysis of nucleoside hydrolytic
activities in the residue of the enzyme extracts of roots was
performed. As evident from Table 2, there was some reduc-
tion of uridine and xanthosine nucleosidase activities in the
residuesofbothurhmutantplants.Inaddition toavery high
inosine nucleosidase capacity, xanthosine and uridine could
also still be hydrolyzed from residual enzyme activities pres-
ent in the pellet fraction of enzyme extracts. Whether these
activitieswere attributabletotheexistence oftheabove-men-
tioned candidate will be the subject of further studies using a
combination of different double and triple mutants.

www.newphytologist.comBoth URH1 and URH2 are required for efﬁcient
inosine and xanthosine hydrolytic activity
As shown previously, inosine and xanthosine hydrolysis is
strongly reduced in soluble extracts of urh1 and urh2
mutants. Because the remaining activities in the roots of the
urh mutants do not sum to the activity in the wild type, nei-
ther for the substrate inosine nor for xanthosine, it was
postulated that both URH1 and URH2 proteins are neces-
sary for inosine and xanthosine hydrolysis. To test this
hypothesis, mutant extracts were mixed and incubated with
or without substrate before enzyme activity measurements.
Combiningbothmutantextractswiththerespectivesubstrate
restored inosine or xanthosine hydrolytic activity (Fig. 5), thus
revealingthenecessityofatleastthese twoURH isoforms for
active inosine and xanthosine hydrolysis in soluble protein
extracts of plants. This conclusion is further supported by in
vitro activity reconstitution using a mixture of recombinant
URH1 and URH2 proteins, expressed in E. coli after Ni-
NTA puriﬁcation (Fig. S6). However, persistent formation
ofinclusionbodiesandhencealowyield ofrecombinant sol-
uble URH2 prevented us from carrying out a more rigorous
biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein
complex. It also has to be considered that the exact stoichi-
ometry of the postulated URH1–URH2 heteromers is not
known, and the potential activity of the heteromers in ino-
sine and xanthosine hydrolysis may have been
underestimated in our in vitro data. Furthermore, our data
also indicate the involvement of additional proteins or regu-
latory processes for modulation of catalytic activity in vivo,
becauseurh2mutantswerestronglycompromisedinxantho-
sine hydrolytic activity (Fig. 3), although the recombinant
URH1proteinaloneexhibitedxanthosinehydrolysis(Fig. S6).
To date, the occurrence as multimers of identical proteins
has been demonstrated for several nucleoside hydrolases of
protists (Parkin, 1996), but the existence of heteromeric
complexes has not been shown in plants (Guranowski, 1982;
Szuwart et al., 2006). However, the coexistence of homo-
meric and heteromeric complexes of different isoforms with
distinct functions has been shown for other enzymes; for
example, aldehyde oxidases in A. thaliana (Akaba et al.,
1999). In addition, it is assumed that substrate speciﬁcity of
nucleosidases is not absolutely strict, and substrate recogni-
tion seems to be mainly based on the ribose moiety (Versees
& Steyaert, 2003). On the basis of our metabolite and activ-
ity data, we propose that there are nucleosidase enzyme
complexes in plants with different subunit compositions,
which determine their substrate speciﬁcities. In the case of
A. thaliana, an URH1 homomer may be responsible for
uridine hydrolysis, while an URH1–URH2 heteromer is
responsible for xanthosine and inosine hydrolysis.
This theory is further supported by the fact that at least
one homolog of each of the two URH genes can be found
in the completely sequenced genomes of moss (Physcomitrella
patens), monocotyledons (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and
Oryza sativa), and dicotyledonous species (Populus trichocarpa,
Vitis vinifera and A. thaliana). The occurrence of both iso-
forms in the Embryophyta genomes suggests a preservation of
the URH1–URH2 functional relationship during evolution.
Conclusion
This investigation of plant mutants identiﬁed the hitherto
superﬁcially investigated xanthosine as a central substrate
for cytosolic nucleoside hydrolases. Our ﬁndings revealed
that nucleoside hydrolase activity and substrate speciﬁcity
also depend on the presence and interaction of different
subunits. To date, only heterologously expressed single pro-
teins have been used for such analyses, including
crystallization studies (Petersen & Møller, 2001; Versees &
Steyaert, 2003; Kim et al., 2006; Iovane et al., 2008).
Therefore, standard in vitro analysis was unsuitable for the
detection of this phenomenon, concomitantly demonstrat-
ing the utility of cautious in planta biochemical analysis.
These results are also of great signiﬁcance for investigations
of purine alkaloid biosynthesis in caffeine- and theobro-
mine-producing plants, especially as xanthosine is the
starting metabolite for this class of secondary plant prod-
ucts, and we present a way of achieving very substantial
accumulation of this precursor.
In addition, double mutants of the hitherto identiﬁed
nucleoside hydrolases suggest the involvement of additional
as yet unidentiﬁed genes in plant nucleoside hydrolysis. In
addition to the detection of a potential candidate gene by
sequence comparison, our activity measurements clearly
show another nucleoside hydrolase activity with a different
substrate proﬁle, spatially separated from the two herein
described. In-depth analysis of this promising candidate will
be the subject of further studies using double and triple
mutants.
