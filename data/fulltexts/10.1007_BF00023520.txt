Summary 
Inter and intraspecific variation was analyzed in two Catharanthus species with regard to isozyme polymor- 
phism and indole alkaloid content in roots and leaves. No significant differences in alkaloid production were 
observed in three groups of C. roseus plants individualized for their flower color. Conversely, comparisons 
between C. trichoplzyllus and C. roseus, showed large differences of alkaloid profiles in both roots and leaves. 
Specific isozyme markers on four presumed loci were found allowing us to establish that natural hybrid- 
izations could occur between the two species when grown together. Experimental hybridizations confirmed 
that introgressions were feasible but suggested that a reproductive barrier was acting and involved interspecif- 
ic incompatibility. The identification and assay of the main alkaloid compounds in natural interspecific hy- 
brids displayed such a high hybrid vigor that interspecific hybridization may present a new and successful way 
of improving alkaloid production in Catharanthus species. 
Introduction 
The periwinkle plant Catharanthus roSeus GL.) G. 
Don originating from Madagascar was introduced 
as an ornamental plant in various tropical and sub- 
tropical countries such as the Ivory Coast. This spe- 
cies contains a large variety of alkaloids (Svoboda 
& Blake, 1975) and some of them are of great in- 
terest for medical use: ajmalicine’has antihyperten- 
sive properties and vincristine and vinblastine are 
active antitumoral compounds (Conti & Creasey, 
1975). Nevertheless, as vincristine and vinblastine 
are only present in trace amounts in the leaves, the 
preparation of these alkaloids has, for economic 
purposes, still to rely on the extraction of their 
monoindole precursors, catharanthine and vindo- 
line, which are synthesized in more substantial 
quantities (Farnsworth, 1961) and which can yield 
other potent compounds by hemisynthesis. Alka- 
loids are accumulated in all the tissues but some of 
them seem to be organ-specific: ajmalicine and ser- 
pentine are essentially present in the roots while ca- 
tharanthine and vindoline are accumulated in aerial 
parts (Endo et al., 1987; Balsevitch et al., 1988), 
some of the enzymes involved in the last steps of 
indole alkaloid biosynthesis being located in the 
chloroplasts (Luca & Cuttler, 1987) or being light- 
stimulated (Luca et al., 1988). Moreover, a large 
variation in alkaloid production is also reported be- 
tween individuals (Levy et al., 1983; Weissenberg et 
152 
al., 1988) and differs according to growing condi- 
tions (Daddona et al., 1976) and culture stages (Re- 
da, 1978). 
Among the seven Catharanthus species de- 
scribed by Markgraf (1976), C. roseus is the most 
intensively studied in terms of analyses of alkaloid 
content; horticultural types based on flower colors 
in C. roseus have been evaluated in this respect (Pa- 
tra, 1982; Levy et al., 1983). Nevertheless, little is 
known about the taxonomic status and the genetic 
diversity between species in relation to the alkaloid 
content even though spontaneous hybridizations 
have been reported between some species of Ca- 
tharuizthzis (Veyret, 1974; Plaizier, 1981). The aim of 
this paper is to assess and compare at the isozyme 
and alkaloid levels the genetic diversity of C. rosezis 
and C. trichophylhs (Baker) Pichon which is an- 
other species considered to possess interesting 
characteristics. On the other hand, the occurrence 
and the identification of spontaneous hybrids in our 
material provided an opportunity to investigate the 
basis of interspecific hybridizations and breeding 
procedures in terms of alkaloid production. 
Material and methods 
Two strains of C. rosezis and C. trichophyllzis were 
obtained from the Research Department of Pierre 
Fabre Médicaments (Castres, France). Before eval- 
uation, the two strains were maintained in field con- 
ditions for seed multiplication and were grown for 2 
cycles at ORSTOM in Ivory Coast (Research Sta- 
tion of Adiopodoumé). At maturation, pods were 
randomly collected on 100 plants for each species. 
The experimental studies were started after this 
preliminary multiplication and two plots were 
grown separately; 36 plants for each species were 
characterized 130 days after sowing to confirm bo- 
tanical traits and growing habit. The biomass pro- 
duction of each individua1 was determined by mea- 
suring fresh and dried weights (oven dried at 50'C 
for 4 days) of the leaves and roots. The plants were 
scored for isozyme polymorphism by starch gel 
electrophoresis as described previously by Second 
and Trouslot (1980): 8 different enzymes were as- 
sayed but only 4 displayed clear-cut patterns and 
were kept for analysis: malate dehydrogenase 
(Mdh), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 
(Got), esterase (Est), phosphoglucoisomerase 
(Pgi); in addition, 23 intermediate plants only 
found in the C. trichophyllzu plot were included in 
the isozyme analysis since owing to phenotypic 
traits, these plants were suspected of being hybrid 
derivatives. 
Controlled hybridizations were performed in a

greenhouse with some of the previously character- 
ized individuals. Catharanthus species are predom- 
inantly self-pollinated and need emasculation of 
the flower buds 2-3 days before anthesis by cutting 
the corolla tip between stigma and anthers. Fertil- 
ization was attempted during the three following 
days by hand pollination twice a day. Pollinated 
buds were protected by paper bags to prevent acci- 
dental pollination and seed loss at the maturation 
stage. 
Biochemical analyses were carried out in the 
Plant Physiology Laboratory at ORSTOM in Ivory 
Coast. Estimation of alkaloid contents was per- 
formed on 9 representative individuals in each spe- 
cies and 5 plants of each flower type in C. roseus. 
Alkaloid contents were also determined on seven 
presumed natural hybrids which were chosen on 
the basis of their typical hybrid isozyme patterns on 
' the four loci surveyed. For leaf alkaloid extraction, 
dried and finely powdered leaf samples (1.5g of 
each plant) were suspended in 70ml methanolltar- 
taric acid 1% (55/45) for 90min at room temper- 
ature. The suspension was filtered and the metha- 
nol evaporated. After alkalinisation (pH9-lo), the 
solution was extracted twice with CHCI, (40ml). 
The resulting CHCI, extract was dried over anhy- 
drous Na,SO,, filtered and concentrated to dryness. 
For root alkaloid extraction, powdered root sam- 
ples (lg) were suspended for 90min in 10% acetic 
acid (70ml) and then extracted as described above. 
Residues were disolved in methanol (3ml) and the 
alkaloid content was estimated by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography according to the technique 
previously described (Nef et al., 1991). The reten- 
tion times for ajmalicine, catharanthine, serpentine 
and vindoline were 13.3,15.5,17.2 and 18.5min re- 
spectively in this system. 
Results 
Phenotypic clzaracterizatiorz 
Our observations of the plants agreed with the ex- 
pected botanical characteristics (Table 1). The sam- 
ple of C. roseus showed three different flower types 
with pink, white or white red-eyed corollae. These 
three flower types are commonly observed in mix- 
tures in C. roseus strains but they were not associ- 
ated with other phenotypic characters in our strain 
and did not require a special taxonomic status as 
previously reported by Markgraf (1976). C. tricho- 
phyllus was more vigorous and showed more 
branching, the leaves were slightly lanceolated and 
all the flowers were red-purple with a yellow eye. In 
the C. trichophyllus plot, some plants were consid- 
ered separately because they presented intermedi- 
ate characteristics for leaves, pod shape and corolla 
color (Table 1). These plants were vigorous with 
high flowering and seed set ability and appeared 
globally closer to C. triclzophyllus than to C. roseus. 
Fresh and dried weights at the full flowering-early 
maturation stage were significantly higher in C. tri- 
choplzylhs than in C. roseus for both leaves and 
roots, while the off-types were close to C. tricho- 
phyllus (Table 2).

Isozyme polymorphism 
Isozyme polymorphism was low and demonstrated 
similar profiles within and between species for most 
of the different enzymes assayed. Nevertheless, 
four enzymes allowed identification of specific elec- 
tromorphs for each species while the intermediate 
plants produced either the pattern found in C. tri- 
chophyllus or a hybrid pattern according to the en- 
zyme multimeric structure (Fig. 1). Thus, Pgi and 
Mdh zymograms showed a single band with differ- 
ent mobility for each species while the off-types 
most often exhibited a typical three band hybrid 
pattern for a dimeric enzyme with codominant al- 
leles. With Got and Est, several loci are usually ob- 
served in plants, but only the slowest band for Got 
and a fast band with low intensity for Est showed a 
different mobility between the two species; the in- 
termediate plants mainly presented two bands cor- 
responding to a locus encoding for a monomeric en- 
zyme. Thus, we identified 4 diagnostic loci between 
the two species since no variation was scored within 
each species and the off-types can be assumed to 
come from natural hybridizations between C. ro- 
seus and C. trichophyllus. 
In order to refine the study of natural introgres- 
sions between Cutharanthus species, multilocus 
patterns of hybrid derivatives were analyzed taking 
into account the number of alleles coming from C. 
trichophyllus (T) and the number of heterozygous 
loci (H). T and H could range from O to 8 and from O 
to 4 respectively and, assuming that the isozyme loci 
were independent of each other, these two com- 
bined parameters allowed the expected distribu-

progeny. Most of the off-types followed a genic 
structure of F, hybrid with four loci in a heterozy- 
gous state while the other plants corresponded to 
progeny arising from F, or from back-cross with C. 
trichophyllus(Tab1e 3). The offspring number was 
not large enough to separate F, from back cross seg- 
tion was truncated and suggested that these hybrid 
derivatives included, in addition to true F, hybrids, 
cross with C. triclzophyllus; this was consistent with 
the presence of off-types which was limited to the C.

Interspecific hybridization 
Controlled hybridizations were made to measure 
the direction of gene flow between the two species 
using plants previously evaluated for isozyme poly- 
morphism. As already noted by Parker (1980), 
crosses were successful with high seed set and good 
germinating ability of F, when C. trichophyllus was 
the female parent (Table 4). Conversely, reciprocal 
crosses failed to form pods in all cases; these obser- 
vations, coupled with the informations relating the 
genetic structure of natural hybrid derivatives sup- 
port an interspecific incompatibility model be- 
tween C. roseus and C. trichoplayllus; this incompat- 
ibility was assumed previously to have a gameto- 
phytic genetic basis (Parker & Vitti, 1986) and con- 
sequently acted as a restriction of potential 
introgressions from C. triclzoplzyllus towards C. ro- 
seus.

2A) and serpentine in the roots (Fig. 2B) were the 
most abundant compounds whatever the flower 
color. Ajmalicine was present in large amounts in 
the roots but only at trace levels in the leaves while 
catharanthine and vindoline levels were not detect- 
ed in roots. Moreover, from the quantitative point 
of view, the three subsamples were not significantly 
different even if the white colored individuals 
showed a tendency to be more productive. 
Conversely, comparisons between the two spe- 
cies showed major qualitative and quantitative vari- 
ations for the same growing stage. Alkaloid profiles 
differed in C. trichophyllus as evidenced by the ab- 
sence of serpentine in leaf extracts (Fig. 3A) and by 
the production of catharanthine in roots (Fig. 3B). 
Except for ajmaciline, no significant differences of 
alkaloid contents in leaves were found between the 
two species. In roots, great quantitative differences 
appeared and the content of each alkaloid com- 
pound was significantly different between the two 
species (P= O.Ol), C. roseus being 2.6 fold more pro- 
ductive in ajmalicine and serpentine than C. tricho- 
phylliis. 
In the hybrids, the alkaloid content appeared to 
be predominantly concentrated in the leaves in a 
similar manner to C. trichophyllus and all the or- 
gan-specific alkaloids found in each parent were al- 
so observed in the hybrids (Table 5): hybrid leaves 
contained serpentine like C. roselis leaves and their 
roots accumulated catharanthine like C. trichophyl- 
icine and serpentine contents was observed among 
hybrid individuals while no such opposition was 
found between vindoline and catharanthine pro- 
ductions which both increased. The alkaloid pro- 
duction of the hybrids was compared to the parents 
using classical formulas of heterosis estimation: 
firstly, in comparing the mean values of the hybrids 
with the best parent and secondly, in taking as refer- 
ence the best individual values for each alkaloid 
(Table 5). Except for serpentine in leaves and aj- 
malicine in roots, the production of the other alka- 
loids was significantly higher than the best parent. 
The differences remained high when the best hy- 
brid for the overall alkaloid production of the four 
substances considered was compared with the best 
individual values among the parents.

Discussion 
Natural interspecific hybridizations of periwinkles 
have been observed in Madagascar when the differ- 
ent species are grown together in botanical gardens 
or when the geographical distribution overlaps 
(Veyret, 1974; Markgraf, 1976); most of these hy- 
bridizations concerned C. longifolizis x C. roseus. 
Although Cutharunthus species are predominantly 
autogamous, low rates of outcrossing in C. roseus 
have been measured using markers involved in 
seedling pigmentation and flower color (Khrishnan 
et al., 1979). Outcrossing levels may be variable fol- 
lowing environmental conditions and pollinator ef- 
fects; this suggests that the flowering biology can 
maintain an efficient sexual isolation in the natural 
conditions of Madagascar but that conditions in 
Ivory Coast allow a significant outcrossing rate and

introgression opportunities. Nevertheless, a repro- 
ductive barrier is considered to act against C. tricho- 
phyllus since no evidence of introgressions were 
found from C. triclzophyllus to C. roseus after two 
multiplication cycles without control of feconda- 
tion. C. roseus is considered as the only Catharan- 
thus species which presents incompatibility against 
the others (Plaizier, 1981). Our experimental hy- 
bridizations confirm this and suggest a genetic mod- 
el similar to that between the cultivated tomato Ly- 
copersicon esculeiztunz and wild species where F, 
hybridizations and backcrosses are only feasible in 
one direction (McGuire & Rick, 1954). 
The study of the alkaloid production in leaves 
and roots of the two Catharanthus species demon- 
strated that the alkaloid profiles were species-spe- 
cific with slight quantitative variations within each 
species. Differences of alkaloid amounts do not cor- 
respond to different flower types in C. roseus and do 
not confirm previous reports stating that certain 
flower types could be more interesting for their al- 
kaloid content (Patra, 1982). Nevertheless, this lack 
of significant differences can arise from the hetero- 
geneity of our material which was not grown as pure 
inbred lines and from the culture stage. At the in- 
terspecific level, further studies on more represen- 
tative samples should be undertaken to confirm 
that some compounds can be considered as specific 
markers in the same way as isozyme markers. 
Indole alkaloid compounds come from trypto- 
phan metabolism and are related in complex me- 
tabolic pathways'which are not yet clearly elucidat- 
ed. Ajmalicine and serpentine come from the same 
side branch of the main pathway leading to vindo- 
line, catharanthine and the dimeric antineoplastic 
compounds, vincristine and vinblastine (Noe et al., 
1984; Merillon et al., 1986; Doireau et al., 1987). Aj- 
malicine is converted into serpentine through the 
activity of vacuolar basic peroxidases (Blom et al., 
1991) and this conversion seems to be light-depend- 
ent (Knobloch et al., 1982). Our results suggest that 
the enzymatic systems leading to the alkaloid pro- 
duction were differently regulated in the two spe- 
cies of Catharanthus. In hybrids, new equilibrium 
states seem to be obtained between the different 
metabolic pathways that allow the occurrence of all

the alkaloid compounds at the same time. The bet- 
ter production of hybrids can come from comple- 
mentary effects between genes involved in enzymes 
of the alkaloid pathways and can suggest heterosis 
phenomena in secondary metabolism although evi- 
dences at molecular level are not yet available to 
confirm it. 
In hybrids, the new equilibria of metabolic path- 
ways can explain the larger variation between indi- 
viduals for each alkaloid taken separately; never- 
theless, overall alkaloid production in hybrids is 
more stable and shows reduced variance when com- 
pared to the parents even if this production is gener- 
ally considered to be predominantly environment- 
dependent. Thus, it is possible to obtain single indi- 
viduals which show a well balanced alkaloid pro- 
duction. If some intraspecific variation and hetero- 
sis can be utilized with C. roseus (Levy et al., 1983), a 
more substantial genetic improvement can be ex- 
pected in exploiting heterosis between C. roseus 
and C. trichophylhs. On the other hand, in vitro mi- 
cropropagation can be performed successfully with 
C. roselis and clones display reduced variance for 
alkaloid contents after growing in field conditions 
when compared to seed-borne plants (unpublished 
data). This indicates that environmental effects are 
not so strong and that breeding for hybrids having 
high alkaloid contents, coupled to clonal propaga- 
tion, can provide an original means of improving al- 
kaloid production in Catharanthiis.
