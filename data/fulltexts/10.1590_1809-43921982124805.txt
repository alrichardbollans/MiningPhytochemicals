Abstract 
The ethanolic extract of trunk wood of Tachigalia 
paniculata Ducke (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) was 
found to contain substantial quantities of 2-(3-indolyD-
acetic acid. 
INTRODUCTION 
Tachigalia Aubl . , a small genus of the tr ibe 
Caesalpinieae, subfamily Leguminosae-Caesal-
pinioideae, comprises 24 species wh ich occur 
in tropical Central and South America, mostly 
in Amazonia (Polhill & Vidal, 1981). The sole 
chemical registry on the genus refers to T. 
paniculata Ducke, the inf lorescences of which 
were reported to contain tryptamine and N-
methyl tryptamine (Svoboda ct al., 1979). In 
continuation of our work on the chemistry of 
Leguminosae (for Part LIX see Braz Filho et al., 
1980), a trunk wood sample, col lected f rom a 
T. paniculata tree of the Ducke Forest Reserve 
near Manaus, was examined. To our surprise 
we were able to isolate f rom the ethanol 
extract, besides the common plant extractive 
s i tosterol , only 2-(3-indolyl)-acetic ac id . 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Isolation of the constituents- Trunk wood 
of Tachigalia paniculata was reduced to powder 
(5 kp) and percolated w i th ethanol. The solvent 
was evaporated and the residue (15 g) was 
extracted in a soxhlet apparatus successively 
w i th benzene and ethyl acetate. Both solutions 
were evaporated The residue (9 g) of the 
benz'Jne extraction was chromatographed on a 
column of sil ica gel (200 g ) . Elution w i th 
benzene, benzene — ethyl acetate 8:2 and 
ethyl acetate gave respectively aliphatic es-
ters, s i tosterol and indolylacetic ac id. The 
residue (3 .6 g) of the ethyl acetate extract ion 
was chromatographed on a column of sil ica gel 
(110 g ) . Elution w i th chloroform and benzene 
- ethyl acetate 8:2 gave respectively si tosterol 
and indolylacetic ac id . Totals obtained : 
aliphatic esters 3 g, s i tosterol 1.5 g, indolyla-
cet ic acid 100 mg (20 ppm, calculated on 
w o o d ) . 
2-[3-lndolyl)-acetic acid, crystals, l i t . mp 
(Merck Index, 1976) and mp 168-170° (benzene 
— ethyl ace ta te ) . UV (Sadtler UV n=? 223), IR 
(Sad'.ler IR n° 670), 'H NMR (Sadtler NMR 
1198) and mass (Jamieson & Hutzmger. (1970) 
spectra superimposable on analogous spectra 
given in the l i terature. 
DISCUSSION 
Indolylacetic acid (heteroauxin) is a plant 
growth hormone which controls growth by 
promotion of cell elongation at the growing 
t ip. Even stems, branches and trunks of woody 
plants, however, may be major sites of auxin 
synthesis, although they are rarely mentioned 
in standard accounts of the subject (Lit t le et 
al., 1978. Odani, 1970; Sheldrake, 1971; Shel-
drake & Northcote, 1968) . Whi le there is thus 
l i t t le doubt that the compound is widely dis-
tr ibuted in plant t issue, it is equally clear that 
being a hormone, relat ively small quantit ies 
(a few |ig kg) are highly ef f ic ient (van Over-
beck. 1966; Galston & Davies, 1969; Galston & 
Purvos, 1960). This, added to the fact that it 
occurs in plant? in di f ferent combined forms 
(Bandurski & Schulze, 1977; Harborne, 1971) 
explains why it has so far been isolated only 
infrequently in normal phytochemical work .

The unusual finding of mg/kg quantit ies of 
indolylacetic acid in T. paniculata could a priori 
be due to artifact format ion. Indeed, the 
compound can be produced during extract ion 
of plant material either by hydrolysis of 
combined forms (Brenner, 1981), or by enzy-
matic (Whitemore and Zahner, 1964) or 
spontaneous (Shantz, 1966) oxidation of tryp-
tophan; and, as already stated above, T. pani-
culata is rich in tryptophan derived amines. 
Alternatively, epiphytic bacteria or fungi may 
introduce exogenous auxin into cel lular t issue 
(Libbert ef a/., 1966; Pegg, 1976). This latter 
phenomenon is the most attract ive racionali-
zation of th>3 present case. We have reported 
previously that wood samples, void of sub-
stantial quantit ies of autochthonous secondary 
metabolites, may contain a considerable gamut 
of fungal metabol i tes (Alvarenga ef a/., 1978) 
Thus also in T. paniculata the quanti ty of 
secondary metabol i tes may be too small for 
eff icient defense against infestat ion by in-
dolylacetic acid producing microorganisms.
