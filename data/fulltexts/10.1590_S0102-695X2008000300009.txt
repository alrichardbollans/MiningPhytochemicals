ABSTRACT: In this study, we present a proposal for the physical and chemical quality control 
of the powder of the species T. parthenium (feverfew) and its hydroalcoholic extract obtained 
by percolation. The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, the main active compound of this plant, 
was quantifi ed by HPLC and its content was found to be 0.49% in the powder and 1.06% in the 
extract. The total content of fl avonoids, determined by UV spectroscopy, was found to be 0.54% 
in the powder and 1.05% in the hydroalcoholic extract. Santin, the main fl avonoid of this species, 
was isolated and further identifi ed in the extract by HPLC. Since parthenolide can also be found 
in other Asteraceae species, the analysis of santin is important to certify the authenticity of the 
plant material. The results confi rmed the authenticity of the plant material and the effi ciency of 
the extraction procedure.

INTRODUCTION
 Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Schultz Bip. 
(Asteraceae) is known in folk medicine as feverfew. 
This species has been recognized since ancient times 
as a medicine against a wide range of diseases such as 
rheumatism, asthma, toothache, and for the alleviation 
of the “holy fi re”, fever and mainly migraine (Knight, 
1995; Oliveira et al., 2007; Carvalho et al., 2008). Since 
the time of Dioscorides (50 B.C.), feverfew has been 
used in the prevention of migraine, through the Middle 
Ages up to the present (Palevitch et al., 1997).
 Phytochemical studies carried out with this 
species have shown the presence of many constituents, 
mainly sesquiterpene lactones, and also some fl avonoids. 
The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide is the major 
compound and the chemical marker of T. parthenium
(Knight, 1995). 
The commonly used feverfew extracts 
trigger the release of serotonin (5-HT) from platelets, 
thus inducing a wide variety of aggregation agents 
(Pfaffenrath et al., 2002). The effi cacy of the extract in 
migraine prophylaxis was also assessed in randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind and cross-over clinical 
studies (Gruenwald et al., 2000).
 Pharmacological investigations of feverfew 
and parthenolide have demonstrated that both present 
anti-infl ammatory effect through the inhibition of 
eicosanoids and the transcription factor nuclear factor 
kappa-B (NF-NB) (Gruenwald et al., 2000; Garcia-
Piñeres et al., 2001; 2004). Further studies revealed 
that fl avonoids such as santin are also important anti-
infl ammatory constituents of the species (Long et al., 
2003; Williams et al., 1999).
 Although parthenolide as well as feverfew have 
been subject to several chemical and pharmacological

investigations, a study describing the standardization of 
its hydroalcoholic extract including fl avonoid analysis 
and parthenolide quantifi cation is still lacking. Therefore 
we propose herein a methodology for the quality control 
of the powder and the hydroalcoholic extract of T. 
parthenium taking into account the parthenolide and 
fl avonoid contents.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Chemicals
Organic solvents for HPLC analyses 
(Mallinckrodt Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) were 
fi ltered through 0.45 ȝm cellulose membranes prior 
to use. Water was processed in a Millipore, Milli-
Q purifi er (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Organic 
solvents for the other analyses were of analytical grade 
(Merck or Synth, Brazil). The reagents H2SO4, HCl, 
AlCl3, AcOH and fructose were obtained from Merck 
(Brazil). Parthenolide was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (Steihem, Germany).
General experimental procedures
The identity of santin was established by 
1H NMR (Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer, 400 MHz, 
Germany). Flavonoids were quantifi ed in a Hewlett 
Packard UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, (Kayak, XA, 
USA), and IR spectra obtained in a Nicolet Protégé 460 
spectrophotometer (France). 
 The HPLC equipment used in the parthenolide 
quantifi cation consisted of a SLC 10Avp liquid 
chromatograph (Shimadzu Corp., Japan) with a SPD-
M10A diode array detector (DAD), three pumps (LC-
10AD), an integration software (Class vp, v. 5.02) 
and an analytical column Nucleosil 100-5 RP-18, 4.6 
x 250 mm, 5 m, 100 Å (Macherey & Nagel, Durin, 
Germany). The HPLC system employed in the analysis 
of santin was identical to the above, but equipped with 
two pumps only (LC-6AD), a column oven (CTO-
10ASVP) and an analytical column Nucleosil 300-5 RP 
18, 4.6 x 250 mm, 5 m, 300 Å (Macherey & Nagel, 
Durin, Germany).
Plant material
The powder from the aerial parts of T. parthenium
was purchased from Galilee Herbal Remedies (Kibbutz 
Kfar Hanassi, Israel).
Characterization of the T. parthenium powder
Powder fi neness, total ash, acid insoluble ash, 
swelling index and moisture content: these assays were 
performed according to the standard methods described 
in the WHO guidance (Word Health Organization, 
1988).
Extraction, isolation and identifi cation of santin
Extraction of the T. parthenium powder (200 
g) using Me2CO was proceeded through sonication for 
15 min. This procedure was repeated two more times 
and the resulting solvent was evaporated at reduced 
pressure. The crude extract (8 g) obtained was submitted 
to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) with silica gel 
60H (100-200 mesh ASTM, Merck, Brazil), using n-
hexane and increasing amounts of EtOAc and MeOH as 
eluents, yielding seven fractions. Fraction 3 (0.98 g) was 
chromatographed again by VLC using the same solvent 
system described above. Fraction 1 (0.74 g) was purifi ed 
by “fl ash” chromatography using silica gel 60 (230-
400 mesh ASTM, Merck, Brazil) as adsorbent. Elution 
(isocratic) was made with n-hexane:CH2Cl2:2-propanol 
8.0:1.5:0.5 and yielded 28 fractions. Fractions 19-28 (88 
mg) were combined and purifi ed by crystallization from 
n-hexane:MeOH, resulting in 18 mg of pure santin. The 
structure of the fl avonoid (Figure 1) was established 
by comparison of its 1H NMR spectral data with those 
reported in the literature (Williams et al., 1999).
Quantifi cation of total fl avonoids by UV 
spectroscopy
The determination of total fl avonoids was 
carried out by UV spectroscopy according to the 
German Pharmacopoeia (Bundesvereinigung, 1986). 
The method is based on the use of reagents such as 
hexamethylenetetramine and AlCl3, which ionize 
phenolic groups and form acid complexes, thus changing 
the shapes and shifting the absorption peaks of the 
fl avonoids in the spectrum (Mabry et al., 1970).
Quantifi cation of parthenolide by HPLC
The parthenolide (Figure 2) content was 
assessed by an adaptation of the method described by 
Zhou et al. (1999) with the aid of a calibration curve. 
Stock solutions: pure parthenolide (5.0 mg) 
was placed in a volumetric fl ask and the volume was 
completed to 5 mL with MeCN. Standard solutions with 
concentrations of 1, 2, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 Pg/
mL were prepared from the parthenolide stock solution 
(1 mg/mL) by means of serial dilution with MeCN. 
Preparation of sample for analysis: 150 
mg of the T. parthenium powder was extracted with 
10 mL of MeCN-H2O 9:1, sonicated for 30 min and 
centrifuged for 12 min. For the hydroalcoholic extract, 
the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and 150 mg 
of the dried extract was extracted in the same way as 
above. The supernatant was passed through a 13 mm, 
0.45 Pm nylon membrane (Sartorius, Spain). Aliquots 
(20 PL) of standard solutions of parthenolide or sample

were submitted to HPLC in triplicate. A mobile phase 
consisting of a mixture of MeCN-H2O 45:55 was used 
for the elution, run at a fl ow rate of 1.0 mL/min and UV 
detection at 210 nm. 
Method validation. (a) Calibration curve and 
linearity: a calibration curve was constructed with 
standard parthenolide solutions in the concentration 
range of 1 to 750 Pg/mL. Injection volumes were 20 PL. 
Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the average 
detector responses were used to construct the curve 
(Brasil, 2002). (b) Precision and accuracy: three standard 
solutions in three concentration levels (50, 250 and 
750 Pg/mL) in 10 replicates were employed to observe 
the standard deviation of the method in the same day 
(intra-assay precision). For inter-assay precision, a 250 
Pg/mL standard solution was analyzed in 10 replicates 
during three days. The accuracy was obtained for those 
three nominal concentrations of parthenolide (50, 250 
and 750 Pg/mL) performed in quintuplicate (Brasil, 
2002). (c) Specifi city: the purity of the parthenolide 
samples was checked by analyzing the peaks from the 
chromatogram using DAD (Abourashed and Khan, 
2000). (d) Detection limit (DL) and quantifi cation limit 
(QL): the standard solution (1 Pg/mL) was injected three 
times and the signal height and baseline noises were 
averaged as follows: DL = 3 x signal height x standard 
amount/baseline noise, and QL = 10 x signal height x 
standard amount/baseline noise (Brasil, 2002).
Preparation and characterization of the 
hydroalcoholic extract
The extract was obtained by percolation of the 
T. parthenium powder in 70% ethanol according to the 
German Pharmacopoeia specifi cations, as described 
by Schmidt and List (1989). Two parts of the extract 
were obtained from one part of the powder. This process 
was performed in three steps: 1) pre-swelling, for 2 h 
with a 1:3 liquid to powder proportion; 2) intermediate 
maceration (24 h); 3) percolation (4-6 drops/min per 
100 g of powder).
Characterization of the hydroalcoholic extract
Loss on drying: performed according to 
the German Pharmacopoeia (Hartke and Mutschler, 
1987). Density, pH, and alcohol determinations:
performed according to the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia
(Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1977). Total fl avonoids: the
quantifi cation of total fl avonoids was carried out by UV 
spectroscopy according to the German Pharmacopoeia 
(Bundesvereinigung, 1986). TLC analysis: samples 
were eluted with C6H6-Me2CO 9:1 in glass plates coated 
with 0.25 mm of silica gel 60 GF254 (Merck, Brazil); the 
reagent used for the detection of spots was a 1% MeOH 
solution of fructose with 2% H2SO4 1:1; the plates were 
kept during 2-4 min at 110 oC until the appearance of 
colored spots (Drozdz and Bloszyk, 1978); the retention 
times of the spots were compared to that of a parthenolide 
standard. Qualitative analysis of santin: the qualitative 
analysis of santin in the T. parthenium extract as well 
as the sample preparation were carried out according 
to a method described for HPLC analysis of fl avonoids 
in Passifl ora species (Pereira et al., 2004). Santin was 
suspended in 1 mL of MeOH 60% (1 mg/mL), fi ltered 
through a 0.45 m nylon membrane (Sartorius, Spain) 
and directly injected into the HPLC system. Injection 
volumes were 50 PL. Parthenolide content: see above.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Validation of the HPLC method
 The adaptation of the HPLC method for 
parthenolide quantifi cation was made in order to improve 
the specifi city of the parthenolide peak. The method used 
is fast (run time = 15 min, Fig. 3) and simple (isocratic 
elution). The time of analysis is an important factor in 
analytical work since it optimizes equipment use and 
reduces solvent consumption.
 A previous study (Zhou et al., 1999) showed that 
30 min stirring in MeCN-H2O 9:1 is the best system for 
extracting parthenolide. The calibration curve showed 
good linearity (R2 = 0.9994) in the concentration range 
tested. The regression equation was y = 2.10-5x - 5.8839. 
The percentages of relative standard deviation (RSD) 
were 0.23 to 3.7 %.
 Analyses of UV spectra collected at the 
beginning, in the middle and at the end of the parthenolide 
peak showed that the method presents specifi city.
 The limit of quantifi cation was 0.07 Pg and 
the limit of detection was 0.02 Pg. The method resulted 
in acceptable intra and inter-assay precision (Tables 1 
and 2) since the % RSD ranged from 0.34 to 4.1 % for 
the intra-assay and 0.34 to 2.19 % for the inter-assay 
tests. The accuracy ranged from 94.09 to 99.99% and is 
shown in Table 3. These results are in agreement with 
literature data (Brasil, 2002; Causon, 1997) and show 
that the method and sample extraction are reproducible.
Characterization of the T. parthenium powder and 
hydroalcoholic extract
 Several techniques used in this study have 
already been described in the guidelines of World 
Health Organization (WHO, 1998) and pharmacopoeias 
(Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1977) and are essential to 
ensure authenticity, safety and stability of the plant 
material and its preparations. Nevertheless, a publication 
containing a compilation of all these specifi cations for 
T. parthenium (Table 4) was not yet available. 
 The low water content in the T. parthenium 
powder (Table 4) indicates that the plant material 
is stable. Total ash and acid insoluble ash (Table 4)

values are in accordance with literature specifi cations 
and indicate low content of inorganic and silicon 
contaminants (WHO, 1998). The presence of santin (Fig. 
1), parthenolide (Table 4, Fig. 2) and total fl avonoids 
(Table 4) confi rm the authenticity of the plant material. 
All results are acceptable since RSD values were lower 
than 10%.
 The effi ciency of the extraction process is 
infl uenced by the powder fi neness (Table 4), and the 
swelling index assay (Table 4) shows the extra-amount 
of solvent that should be added in the extraction (Schmidt 
and List, 1989).
 The hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by 
percolation since it is a dynamic and continuous method 
and is more effi cient than maceration (Prista and 
Alves, 1967). Losses on drying, density, IR and TLC 
analyses (Table 4) were used to control the extraction 
procedures. 
  The UV-visible absorption spectroscopy 
technique, which was based on the German 
Pharmacopoeia, allowed the quantifi cation of total 
fl avonoids in the powder and also in the hydroalcoholic 
extract (Tables 4 and 5).
The result of IR spectroscopic analysis (Table 5) 
also indicates that the extraction procedure was effi cient 
for parthenolide and fl avonoids, which are the most 
important active compounds of feverfew (Gruenwald et 
al., 2000).
Several studies suggest that parthenolide, 
which is thought to be the most active component of 
T. parthenium, should be used as a chemical marker 
to characterize T. parthenium. However, parthenolide 
has also been reported in other Asteraceae species such 
as the German chamomile [Matricaria recutita (L.) 
Rausch.] and tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.). Both drugs 
are sometimes incorrectly supplied as feverfew (Smith 
and Burford, 1993). Therefore, the identifi cation of 
santin by HPLC as well as quantifi cation of parthenolide 
as proposed herein are very useful parameters to 
characterize T. parthenium unequivocally.
 The results also showed that the use of 
hydroalcoholic extracts is more advantageous than 
the use of the crude powder in order to obtain plant-
derived products or phytomedicines containing higher 
amounts of active compounds such as parthenolide 
and fl avonoids. As demonstrated in the present study, 
these compounds can be easily analyzed by different 
qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Although the 
use of hydroalcoholic extracts is strongly recommended, 
most of the T. parthenium-derived products sold by 
several pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies are 
in form of capsules that simply store the powder of the 
aerial parts of this plant.
 In conclusion, a reliable methodology for the 
quality control of the powder and the hydroalcoholic 
extract of T. parthenium is now reported. It takes into
