6. CHANGES IN NITROGENOUS COMPOSITION DURING THE GROWTH
OF CONVALLARIA AND POLYGONATUM*
By L. FOWDEN

(Received 6 October 1958)
Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid has been recognized as
an important constituent of the 70% ethanol-
soluble-nitrogen fraction of many liliaceous plants
(Fowden, 1956; Fowden & Steward, 1957). Con-
vaUaria majali8 (lily of the valley) and Polygonatum
multiflorum (a Solomon's seal) are two common
representatives of these plants im Britain, and
part 6 of this series (Fowden & Bryant, 1959)
described experiments in which various 14C-
labelled substances were supplied to tissues of
these two plants to obtain information about the
manner of biogenesis of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.
In this paper variations in the major nitrogenous
fractions present in different organs of the plants
during growth have been investigated to ascertain
in another way where azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is
synthesized and at what stage of the plant's
development synthesis occurred. The importance of
the imino acid in the general nitrogen economy of
the plants is discussed.
EXPERIMENTAL
All plants were grown outdoors on the same location.
Samples were collected at four stages of growth (S1, S2,
S 3 and S4). The first collection (S 1) was made in February
when the shoots remained as small underground buds.
Collection S2 was made in mid-April. The Convallaria
shoots were then 6-8 cm. high, the leaves being still rolled.
The Polygonatum shoots were 12-15 cm. high, but the first
leaves were not yet fully expanded. Collection S3 was
made in late May when both plants were nearly mature.
The Convallaria leaves were unfolded and had attained
nearly maximum size, whereas the Polygonatum shoots had
grown to their full height (60-80 cm.) and gained their
maximum number of leaves. Both plants were in flower at
this stage. The final collection S4 was taken in August
when the shoots of both plants were becoming senescent
and the leaves were browning. At each stage the plants
were separated into root, rhizome and shoot components
before analysis and their dry weight/fresh weight ratios
determined. Since both plants are perennials the per-
centage increases in the shoot weights occurring during one
season's growth were far higher than the corresponding
increases for rhizome or roots.

Fractionation of the nitrogen constituents. Washed plant
tissues were dried at 950 for 1 hr. and then at 650 to con.
stant weight. The dried materials were ground to homo-
geneous powders upon which total nitrogen determinations
were made. Other batches of plant material were macer-
ated in an Ato-Mix Blender with 75% (v/v) ethanol
(10 ml./g. fresh wt. of material). Extraction at laboratory
temperature was continued for 24 hr. with shaking and,
after separation of the extract and residue by centrifuging,
the residue was twice re-extracted. The extracts were
evaporated to dryness at temperatures below 500 and the
residues were redissolved in water. Any material remaining
insoluble at this stage was removed by centrifuging and
discarded. Measured portions of these solutions were used
for determinations of total soluble nitrogen and of indi-
vidual free amino and imino acids.
Nitrogen determinations. Nitrogen was assayed by the
micro-Kjeldahl method of Chibnall, Rees & Williams (1943).
Amino acid determinations. Individual acids were deter-
mined after their separation on two-dimensional paper
chromatograms. The methods used have been described
previously (Fowden & Bryant, 1959; Fowden & Webb,
1958; Fowden, 1954). A preliminary separation of the
cationic fraction (amino acids) from each extract was made
(Fowden & Webb, 1958) before paper chromatograms were
prepared. The volumes of the cationic fractions were
adjusted so that 1 ml. was equivalent to 2 g. fresh wt. of
plant material, and 501u. of each was applied to the chro-
matograms (Whatman no. 3MM chromatographic-grade
filter paper). Phenol-aq. NH, soln. (Dent, 1947) was used
as the first developing solvent, and was followed by butan-
1-ol-acetic acid-water (Partridge, 1948). The final chro-
matogram size was 27 cm. x 27 cm. Location of the amino
acid spots and the quantitative determination of each
followed exactly the procedure described by Fowden
(1954). Only the principal free amino acids were assayed;
these included glutamic acid, glutamine, asparagine,
alanine, serine, arginine and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.
The reported values are means of triplicate determinations
and are subject to errors up to ± 10% of the recorded
values.
Although azetidine-2-carboxylic acid gives a brown spot
after treatment of qualitative paper chromatograms with
ninhydrin, the imino acid reacts to give a normal bluish
purple colour (absorption maximum A 570 m,) under the
controlled conditions used in quantitative colour develop-
ment. Colour production from azetidine-2-carboxylic acid
was, however, only about 25% of that obtained when an
equivalent amount of an ac-amino acid reacted with nin-
hydrin.

RESULTS
Both plants have perennial rhizomes and roots but
produce completely new shoots each year. During
one season's growth the percentage changes in the
dry weight of rhizome and root components are
very small compared with those of the shoots. For
instance in Convalkaria the dry weights of the shoot
at S2, S3 and S4 were approximately 2-6, 15 and
40 times the corresponding weight at S 1.
The total- and soluble-nitrogen contents of the
plants' organs at the different stages of develop-
ment are presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.
The dry-weight/fresh-weight ratios of the tissues
are given in parentheses in Table 1. Active growth
of the plants began between S 1 and S2 and was
presumably associated with a marked uptake of
nutrients which led to increased total nitrogen
contents throughout the plant. This increase was
particularly pronounced for Polygonatum shoots,
which attained a very high 'crude protein' content
(about 48% of the dry weight) at S2. As further
growth of the shoot occurred and the leaves
reached maturity their total nitrogen content
rapidly decreased. Smaller decreases were ob-
served for the rhizome and root tissues between S 2
and S4.
In Convallaria the variations in the soluble-
nitrogen contents of the tissues followed the same
pattem as those of total nitrogen. Maximum
values were generally reached at S 2. The increases
observed for the shoot and root between S 1 and S 2
and the subsequent decreases to S4 tended to be
proportionately greater than those observed for the
total nitrogen content of the same organ. Soluble
nitrogen at S 2 therefore represented a larger
percentage of the total nitrogen of these organs
than it did at any other stage of growth (see
parentheses, Table 2). The ratio soluble nitrogen/
total nitrogen was generally higher in the rhizome
than in the other organs. The most striking feature
of the soluble-nitrogen data for Polygonatum was
also the remarkably high levels found in the
rhizome, particularly when expressed as per-
centages of the total nitrogen (see Table 2). These
latter percentages were appreciably higher than the
corresponding ones determined for Convallaria
rhizome and somewhat higher than those recorded
by Steward & Thompson (1954) for other typical
storage organs, e.g. potato tuber, approximately
70%, and carrot root, approximately 60%.
The concentrations of individual free amino
acids in the plant tissues are presented in Table 3.
Well-marked trends in the concentrations were

observed only in the shoots. In Polygonatum the
concentrations of most amino and imino acids fell
progressively during development from S1 to S4.
In Convallaria an initial increase generally occurred
in amino acid concentrations during the early
growth of the shoot (S 1 to S 2); further growth was
accompanied by decreased concentrations of most
acids.
Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid was the most im-
portant constituent of the soluble-nitrogen fraction
of all Polygonatum tissues, but in Convallaria it
accumulated in very high concentrations only in
the shoot. Arginine and the amides, glutamine and
asparagine, were also important components of the
soluble-nitrogen fraction of the plants at certain
stages of development.
DISCUSSION
Analytical data ofthe present type can be presented
in several ways; the amount of any single nitro-
genous component can be expressed in terms of the
plant's fresh weight, dry weight or total nitrogen
content. It is not easy to decide which mode of
expression is most useful. Values on a fresh-weight
basis are valuable for most tissues in that they
reflect the actual concentrations at which the
nitrogen compounds are found within the cells.
However, these values have less significance for
tissues like rhizome where the dry-weight/fresh-
weight ratio was relatively high. They also suffer
from the disadvantage that the water content and
hence the fresh weight of plant tissues may vary
with changes in the plant's environmental condi-
tions to a greater extent than the dry weight.
A compromise was therefore used, all values being
presented on a dry-weight basis and the dry-weight/
fresh-weight ratios for all tissues were included in
the tables. Values can be converted into a fresh-
weight basis if this is desirable.
The fact that growth of both species beyond S 2
was accompanied by progressively lower total

nitrogen contents agrees with similar observations
made for many other species and several factors are
probably operative in producing these decreases.
During shoot growth between S I and S 2 the cells
of the originally underground buds must have
undergone a transition from a slow to a rapid state
of division and this change was associated with a
lowered dry-weight/fresh-weight ratio regarded as
typical of meristematic tissue having a high rate of
protein synthesis. Cell division after S 2 would be
restricted to a smaller proportion of the cells of
the shoot and the further growth to stages S 3 and
S 4 was accompanied by progressively increased
dry-weight/fresh-weight ratios, indicating that
secondary thickening of many cell walls was
occurring and producing increased carbohydrate to
protein ratios. Decreases in the total nitrogen
contents of the rhizomes and roots may in part be
due to similar but less extensive changes in
cellular activity in these organs. An extensive
deposition, particularly in the rhizome storage
tissue, of reserve carbohydrate products of photo-
synthesis would be expected to occur during the
later part ofthe growing period and so this would be
another factor leading to decreased nitrogen con-
centrations in the underground organs.
The decreases in the soluble-nitrogen concentra-
tion in the shoots between S 2 and S4 are particu-
larly striking. During this time the dry weight of
the Convallatia shoot increased about 17-fold,
whereas the total amount of nitrogen in the shoot
increased only about six times. These figures may
indicate that the supply of nitrogen to the shoot
became limiting in the later stages of its growth and
under these conditions there would be a tendency
for available nitrogen to be incorporated into
protein and so produce the observed marked
decrease in soluble nitrogen compounds.
The exact reasons for the high concentrations of
soluble nitrogen in the root and shoot of Convallaria
at S2 must be looked for in the individual free
amino and imino acid concentrations (Table 3).
Although the percentage increase for some of them
(glutamic acid, glutamine and alanine) was larger
than that of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, it was the
increase in the total amount of the imino acid that
had a profound effect on the soluble-nitrogen level.
Between S 1 and S 2 the soluble nitrogen increased
by 7.3 mg./g. dry wt.; the increased concentration
of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid accounted for about
half of this (3.6 mg./g. dry wt.). In contrast, the
increased soluble-nitrogen levels of the root at S2
could not be attributed to changes of concentra-
tions of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, for although
the concentrations of most other amino acids in-
creased between S 1 and S2 the imino acid levels
actually decreased. Arginine showed the most
marked increase of concentration and the increased
VDEN I959
amount of nitrogen present in the amino acid at S 2
compared with S 1 represented about one-third of
the total increase of soluble nitrogen.
During the period S 1-S 2 the dry weight of the
shoot increased 2 6 times, so that the total quantity
of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid present in the shoot
at S2 was approximately nine times that at S 1.
Although the decreases in the concentration of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid within the root and
rhizome between S1 and S2 were small in com-
parison with the increase in the shoot, approxi-
mately half of the extra azetidine-2-carboxylic acid
appearing in the shoot could have been transferred
from the underground organs, since at S2 their
combined weights were about 20 times that of the
shoot. This calculation assumes no synthesis of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid within the root or
rhizome. If a net synthesis of the imino acid was
occurring in one or both of these organs, then con-
siderably more than half of the azetidine-2-
carboxylic acid appearing in the shoot may have
been deposited there after translocation. A further,
approximately twofold, increase in the total amount
of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in the shoot occurred
between S 2 and S 3, for although the concentration
of the imino acid decreased during this phase of
growth, the dry weight of the shoot increased about
fivefold. However, at this stage the concentrations
of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in root and rhizome
remained nearly constant. Therefore active trans-
location of the compound to the shoot would
appear less likely at this stage, and synthesis of
the imino acid was probably occurring within the
shoot itself. This conclusion is in agreement with
the observation of Fowden & Bryant (1959), who
showed that excised leaves of Convallaria at this
stage of development could photosynthetically
assimilate 14CO2 slowly into azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid. Little change occurred in the total amount of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid within the shoot
between S3 and S4, a further decrease in its con-
centration being offset by an increase in the shoot
dry weight. It is then perhaps significant that in
this period there was a very marked increase in the
concentration of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in the
root, even though the concentrations ofmost of the
other amino acids decreased. This observation
suggests that in C(onvallaria the root may act as a
major site of synthesis of azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid, a fact that became apparent only at this late
stage of growth when active translocation of the
imino acid appeared to have ceased.
Reference to Table 3 shows that in Polygonatum
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid was the major com-
ponent of the soluble-nitrogen fractions of all
tissues at all stages of growth. Particularly in the
rhizome variations in the concentrations of other
free amino acids were completely overshadowed by

the much larger changes in concentration of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid. The imino acid repre-
sented a higher proportion of the soluble-nitrogen
fraction at S 4 than at any earlier stage of growth,
but it reached its highest concentration on a dry-
weight basis at S2, when about 6-5% of the dry
weight of the rhizome consisted of azetidine-2-
carboxylic acid. This is a remarkably high concen-
tration for a soluble-nitrogen compound; com-
parable concentrations have been observed only for
certain alkaloids (see James, 1950). A further
unusual finding was that the nitrogen present in
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid of the rhizome generally
exceeded that present in the protein. For instance
at S 4 the nitrogen of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid
represented about 55% and protein nitrogen only
about 20% of the total nitrogen.
Decreases in the concentrations of most amino
acids occurred during the growth of the Poly-
gonatum shoot, particularly between stages S 3 and
S4. The concentration of azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid at S 4 was only about 5% of that at S 1. Since
the increase in the dry weight of the shoot during
the whole period of growth was only slightly
greater than 20-fold no significant increase in the
total amount of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in the
shoot occurred. The possibility that active trans-
location of the imino acid from the underground
organs to the shoot occurred therefore appeared less
likely than in Convallaria; however, it cannot be
completely ruled out since shoots of Polygonatum
may be able to degrade the compound. Informa-
tion is lacking about this degradation in Poly-
gonaturn but preliminary studieswith [14C]azetidine-
2-carboxylic acid indicated that degradation pro-
ceeded very slowly in Convallaria leaves (Fowden &
Bryant, 1959).
Attention was drawn earlier to the increase in
concentration of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in
Convallaria roots between S3 and S4. Table 3
shows that a similar rapid increase occurred for the
imino acid in Polygonatum roots. Although some
significance was attached to this finding in regard
to the site of synthesis of azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid in Convallaria, the position in Polygonatum is
more obscure. The increase in concentration of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in the roots was
paralleled by an even larger increase in the amount
of the imino acid present in the rhizome. There-
fore the possibility that synthesis can proceed
in both organs cannot be overlooked. Fowden &
Bryant (1959) found that radioactivity supplied
to roots and rhizome of Polygonatum in the
form of [14C]aspartic acid was incorporated into
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid more rapidly in the
former organ, although some azetidine-2-carb-
oxylic acid was apparently also synthesized in the
rhizome.
The role of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in the
nitrogen metabolisn of liliaceous plants remains in
doubt. The high concentrations in which it is
encountered suggests that it is more likely to play
the role of a storage compound rather than that of
an actively metabolized intermediate compound.
This conclusion receives some support from experi-
ments with [14C]amino acids, which showed that the
rates of synthesis and degradation of the imino
acid in these plants were slow (Fowden & Bryant,
1959). If azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is correctly
regarded as a storage compound, then nitrogen so
combined is probably less readily available for re-
utilization than that present in other compounds
such as glutamine and asparagine that are con-
sidered to play a similar role. The high concentra-
tions and relatively low metabolic activity of
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in plants suggest that
it may be more closely akin to the alkaloids than
to the majority of amino acids. Indeed it is tempt-
ing to speculate that alkaloid-like compounds
based on the four-atom heterocyclic ring of
azetidine will ultimately be discovered in plants.
A compound bearing the same structural relation
to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid as that shown to
proline by the alkaloid stachydrin would seem a
distinct possibility.
Ifthe idea is accepted that azetidine-2-carboxylic
acid is synthesized largely in the root of Convallaria
and then translocated and deposited as a storage
compound in the leaves, a further similarity with
certain alkaloids emerges. For example, a parallel
exists with nicotine, which is elaborated by the
roots of the tobacco plant (Mothes, 1928; Dawson,
1941, 1942). However, nicotine tends to be present
in this organ in only low concentrations and is
mainly transported to the leaves, where it is stored
at much higher concentrations.
Our present understanding of the behaviour and
function of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in plants is
certainly limited. The compound possesses features
ofmetabolism which identify it closely in behaviour
with a group of other compounds like alkaloids,
floral pigments, glycosides, etc., the reason for
whose existence in plants still remains unsolved.
SUMMARY
1. Variations occurring in the nitrogenous com-
position during the growth of Convallaria majali8
and Polygonatum multiflorum plants were investi-
gated. At four stages of growth the concentrations
of total nitrogen, 75% (v/v) ethanol-soluble
nitrogen and certain amino and imino acids were
determined separately for roots, rhizome and
shoots.
2. The soluble-nitrogen content of both plants,
but particularly that of Polygonatum, was high
Vol. 7I 647

when expressed as a percentage of the total nitro-
gen. This observation is in agreement with those
recorded previously for typical storage organs.
3. The two plants contained very large amounts
of the imino acid, azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.
Nitrogen present in azetidine-2-carboxylic acid
represented more than 50% of the total nitrogen of
Polygonatum rhizome. The imino acid was also
present in high concentrations in the young shoots
of both plants, but its concentration in the mature
shoots was much lower.
4. The analytical data indicate that the root
may form a major site of synthesis of azetidine-2-
carboxylic acid in Convallaria. It is more difficult
to draw conclusions for Polygonatum since the very
high concentrations present in its rhizome at all
stages of growth tended to overshadow smaller
changes of concentration elsewhere in the plant.

(Received 19 September 1958)
During recent years a considerable amount of
information has become available concerning the
non-protein nitrogenous constituents, and especi-
ally the amino acids in the haemolymph of various
species of insects. Most of this is due to the work of
Florkin and his colleagues, who have in the main
used microbiological methods for their assays of
amino acids (Florkin, 1954). It appears that the
haemolymph of insects is characterized by a
relatively high amino acid content, and in this
respect they differ markedly from crustaceans such
as lobsters which, though containing a high con-
centration of free amino acids in their muscles,
have very little in the haemolymph (Kermack,
Lees & Wood, 1955). Little or no information
appeared to be available about the free amino acid
content of insect muscle.
An insect which it seemed convenient to study in
this respect was the migratory locust Locusta
migratoria migratorioides. The insect order Ortho-
ptera, to which the locust belongs, contains many of
the larger insects, and a considerable amount of
research has been carried out on this order. From
the available data, the metabolism of orthopteran
muscle appears to be similar to that of mammalian
muscle; for example, the occurrence of glycolysis
and the presence of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in
the African migratory locust has been demon-
strated by Rees (1954) and adenosine triphosphate
has been isolated from the muscle of the locust
Gastrimargu8 muBicu8 (Calaby, 1951).
In the present work the nature of the non-protein
nitrogenous constituents of locust muscle was in-
vestigated. Some of the present results have
already been briefly presented (Kermack & Stein,
1955).
MATERIA:LS AND METHODS
Locuwt&. Fifth-stage nymphs of the African migratory
locust, supplied by the Anti-Locust Research Centre,
London, were kept in the Laboratory under the conditions
advised by the Centre. The locusts, after undergoing their
final moult to the adult form, were used as required. After
starving overnight they were killed by placing for a few
minutes in a jar containing chloroform, then cut open
dorsally, the alimentary canal and fat body were removed
and the thoracic muscles in situ washed free ofhaemolymph
by squeezing 1% (w/v) NaCl from a Pasteur pipette
between and underneath the muscle bands. Residual saline
on the surface was removed with filter paper and the
intact muscle excised.
Muscle extract. Muscle from about six locusts was
homogenized with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (5 ml.) for
5 min. in a Mickel homogenizer. The suspension was
allowed to stand for 15 min. and centrifuged. The muscle
residue was extracted a second time in the same way, and
