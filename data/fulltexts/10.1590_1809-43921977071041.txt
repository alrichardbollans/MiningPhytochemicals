The chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae XLVI. Notes on Dniba species Abstract Aniba affin.is, A. cylindrifiora. and A. mas (Lau-raceae) were found to contain respectively benzofuranoid (and a previously unknown bicyclo [3, 2, 1] octanoid) neolignans, 6-styryl-2-pyrones and 6-styryl-4-methoxy-2-pyrones. In continuation of a series of reports on the chemical composition of Lauraceae, be-longing predominantly to the genus Aniba [Al-varenga et ai., 1977b and previous papers of the series] we examined the following species. Aniba affinis (Meissn.) Mez The specimen, from the confluence of the rivers Negro and Maipendi, Amazonas, voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, 58520, was co llected and identified by Dr. K. Kubitzki, Hamburg. A trunk wood sample (370 g) was ex-tracted with ethanol. The chloroform soluble part (6 g) of the extract (25. 5 g) was chromatographed on a sílica column. Elution with benzene gave, in order, terpenes (54 mg) , benzyl salicylate (40 mg), benzyl benzoate (600 mg), (2S,3S) - 7 - ally l - 6 - hydroxy - 5 - me-thoxy - 3 - methyl - 2 - píperonyl - 2,3 - dihydro-benzofuran ( 4 [ Gottl i eb et a/. , 1975] 30 mg) , (2S,3S) - 6- O- allyl - 5- methoxy- 3 - methyl -- 2 - piperonyl - 2,3 - dihydrobenzofuran (3 [Gottlieb et ai., 1975; Alvarenga et a/., 1977a] 32 mg), sitosterol (85 mg), 2 - guaiacyl - 7 -methoxy - 3 - methyl - 5 - propenyl - 2,3 - dihy· drobenzofuran (5 [Aiba et a/., 1973] + 6a, 60 Aura M .

Elution with benzene·chloroform 7:3 gave (2S, 3S, SS) - 5 - allyl - 5 - methoxy - 3 - methyl - 2 -piperonyl - 2, 3, 5, 6 - tetrahydro - 6 - oxobenzo-furan (2a [Alvarenga et a/., 1977a] 150 mg) and (2S, 3S, 3aR) - 3a - allyl - 5 - methoxy - 3 -methyl - 2 - piperonyl - 2, 3, 3a, 6 - tetrahydro · 6-oxobenzofuran (ta [Lima et a/., 1972] 1.19 g). The compounds were purified either by re-crystall ization (1a, burchellin), or by prepa-rative TLC (sílica, 2a: C6H6-Ac0Et 8:2, ali other C6H6) . The presence of benzaldehyde in benzyl benzoate + benzyl salicylate fractions was ascertained by the characteristic 1 H NMR peaks [ Bhacca et a/., 1962]. The identity o f ali other compounds, with exception of 7e which has not been described previously, was confir-med by di rect comparison with authentic samples. Dehydrodiisoeugenol was previously ob-tained from Lauraceae in crystalline form (5 [Aiba et a/., 1973]). The fact that it was isoiated form A. affinis as an oil may indicate the símultaneous presence of the enantiomers 5 + 6a (for an analogous case see Aiba and Gottlieb, 1975). In this connection it is signifi-cant to recall that a previously examined specimen of an A. species, provisional ref. 60, voucher INPA 43452, was shown to contaín 6b [Fernandes et a/., 1976). This specimen, now also identified with A. affinis by Dr. Kubitzki , contains additionally 1 a, 1 b, 1 c, 2b and four bicyclo [3,2,1] octanoid neolignans 7a, 7b, 7c ( • ) - Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus .

The IH NMR spectrum of 7b is closely comparable with the analogous spectrum of 7e isolated during the present study (Table 1). The only significant difference refers to the substitution of OMe/OH signals, consistent with the fact that the novel compound 7e is a 3-de-0-methyl derivative of 7b.
