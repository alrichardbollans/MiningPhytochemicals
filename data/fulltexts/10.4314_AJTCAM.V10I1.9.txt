Abstract 
 
This study was specifically designed to identify anticancer constituents in methanol-water extract of Polygonum bistorta 
L. and evaluate its cytotoxicity. For this purpose methanol-water (40:60 v/v) extract was subjected to conventional preparative 
high pressure liquid chromatography and 13 fractions were obtained. Constituents of obtained fractions were separated and 
identified with the help of GC-MS and LC-DAD-ESI-MS. Anticancer phenolic compounds such as gallic acid, protocatechuic 
acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, catechol, 4-methyl catechol, syringol and pyrogallol 
and fatty acids such as linoleic acid, myristic acid and palmitic acid were separated from different fractions. Fractions were 
evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on a rarely studied human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCCLM3). 11 fractions 
showed good to strong cytotoxicity in a range of 200 µg/mL-800 µg/mL, whereas 2 fractions did not show any activity even at 
800 µg/mL and no anticancer constituent was detected from them. 50 percent growth inhibition (GI50) values for five most active 
fractions were calculated and results were in a range of 86.5 (±3) µg/mL-126.8 (±3) µg/mL. 3 out of these 5 most active fractions 
were found to contain phenolic content in them whereas all other fractions containing phenolic content did possess cytotoxic 
activity that may suggest the importance of phenolic constituents in anticancer activity. Moreover, the results also showed a 
definite dose dependent relationship between amount of fractions and cytotoxic activity. 
 
Key words: cytotoxicity, Polygonum bistorta, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, anticancer  activity. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Polygonum bistorta L. (PB) belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is a well known traditional Chinese medicine. It is 
used for various curative purposes in different parts of the world especially Asian (China, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan), 
African, European and American countries. On the other hand, its roots and leaves are cooked and eaten as raw food in different 
regions of Europe and America (Moerman et al., 1998; Couplan and Duke, 1998). In India and Pakistan, it has traditionally been 
used in making heat clearing drinks and syrups. “Chinese Pharmacopoeia” (2005), and other online literature have also cited this 
medicine as a single cure for various diseases such as dysentery with bloody stools, diarrhoea in acute gastroenteritis, 
hematemesis, epitasis, leucorrhoea, cholera, scrofula, oral ulcer haemorrhoidal bleeding and acute respiratory infection with 
cough and even snakebites. Previous literature on PB cites that it has anti-inflammatory (Duwiejua et al., 1994, 1999), 
antibacterial (Liu et al., 2006; Khalid et al., 2011), antiviral, anti-mutative (Miki et al., 1995), antioxidant (Chang et al., 2009) 
whereas Manoharan et al., (2007) evaluated it for cytotoxic activity by using solvent extraction technique and found strong 
cytotoxic activity for its chloroform and hexane fractions and few of their sub-fractions. 
PB has been widely studied for its chemical profiling and found to possess different classes of constituents such as 
phenolics (Liu et al., 2004; Intisar et al., 2012), flavonoids (Smolarz, 2002), steroids (Sun et al., 2007), triterpenoids (Manoharan 
et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2007) and tannins (Liu et al., 2006). High pressure preparative liquid chromatography is a technique that 
has been used for decades for the separation, isolation and purification of bioactive plant constituents leading to their 
identification by the use of mass spectroscopic techniques (Shang et al., 2010). In our research work, 40 % methanol-water extract 
of PB was studied for the cytotoxic activity as it contains phenolic constituents (especially anticancer phenolic acids) that are 
well-known compounds that possess anticancer activity (Cai et al., 2004; Gomes et al., 2003) as well as anticancer fatty acids 
(Sagar and Das, 1995; Salerno and Smith, 1991). For this purpose, the extract was subjected to conventional preparative high 
pressure liquid chromatography to obtain different fractions followed by the identification of their phenolic and fatty acid content 
and evaluation of each fraction for cytotoxic activity against cancer line. The main aims of this study were the separation and 
identification of anticancer constituents and evaluation of methanol-water extract of this plant for cytotoxic activity.

Methanol, ethanol and PBS were purchased from Sinopharm (Shanghai, China). DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified eagle 
medium), FCS (foetal calf serum), penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). Water 
used in all experiments was purified by a Sartorius Arium 611 system (Goettingen, Germany). Healthy rhizomes of PB were 
purchased from the local market of Lahore, Pakistan in January, 2011. Samples were identified by the “School of Pharmacy, East 
China University of Science and Technology” as “Polygonum bistorta L.” All chemicals used in the experiments were of 
analytical grade.

PB rhizomes were dried, cleaned and ground to make a fine powder and passed through a 0.45 mm mesh. The sample 
was extracted according to the previously reported method with minor modification (Intisar et al., 2012 ) as followed: 300 grams 
of this fine powder was dissolved in 20 litres of 40% methanol-water solvent and heated at 50°С for 4 hours. The sample was 
filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and concentrated by vacuum distillation. 
 
Preparative chromatography conditions 
 
 The preparative separation was performed on an ODS glass column (26 mm × 460 mm) with a particle size of 30 μm. 
Pure water (A) and methanol (B) were used as the mobile phase. The optimized gradient elution program was 0~38 min: B 
5%~18%, 38~76min: B 18%~28%, 76~95min: B 28~50%, 95~118min: B 50~85%, 118~123 min: B isocratic 85%. The flow rate 
for the experiment was 30 mL/min and injection volume of 25 mL was used in each run. The detection wavelength was 280 nm 
and the whole experiment was carried out at room temperature (25°C). 13 fractions were obtained. 
 
GC-MS conditions for obtained fractions 
 
All fractions obtained from preparative LC were dissolved in pure methanol and run through GC-MS. The separation 
was performed by using an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness) manufactured by 
Agilent. The operating conditions used were a temperature gradient as followed: 60°C for 3 minutes and then increased at a rate 
of 20°C/min  to 280°C and then held at 280°C for 15 minutes. An injection volume of 5μl was used in split mode (split ratio 
1:30). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flowrate of 1 mL/min. The mass detector conditions were: transfer line temperature of 
250°C and a solvent delay of 3 min were selected, the mass range m/z was 30~500 and a multi-channel plate voltage of 2200V 
was used. The detector temperature was 280°C. The ion source temperature of 230°C and ionizing voltage of  70eV was used. 
 
HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS conditions 
 
 HPLC separation was  performed by using a Waters XTerra MS column (2.1 mm × 150 mm) with a particle size of 5 
μm. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in Acetronitrile (ACN). The gradient elution 
program of 0~20 min: B 10%~30%, 20~30 min: B 30%~50% was used for the separation of fractions 3-12. The flow rate for the 
experiment was 0.2 mL/min and injection volume was 2 μl. The detection wavelengths were calculated by DAD detector in a 
range of 214 nm-360 nm. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (25°C). The ESI-MS was operated in negative ion 
mode. ESI-MS conditions were as followed: capillary voltage and cone voltage were 3 kV and 15 V respectively, nitrogen was 
used as a the desolvation gas at 600 L/h, source temperature and desolvation temperature were 120°C and 380°C, respectively. 
The scan range was selected between 100~600 m/z.  
 
Cell culture 
 
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCCLM3) with high metastatic capacity was obtained from cell bank of 
Zhongshan Hospital (Shanghai, China) for performing cytotoxicity experiments. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified 
eagle’s medium (DMEM) with high glucose, containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 
37°C. The medium was supplied with penicillin (50 IU/mL) and streptomycin (50 µg/mL). 
 
Cytotoxicity assay 
 
Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 96-well microplates at a density of 3.5 × 103 cells per well in 100 µl of 
culture medium and were allowed to adhere for 18 h before treatment. PBS was used as a negative control. Fractions were initially 
dissolved in pure water and their final volumes were adjusted with PBS. Then increasing concentrations of these fractions were 
evaluated against the selected cancer cell line. Three replicates were carried out for each dosage. Cells were incubated for 24 h in 
the presence or absence of different amounts of fractions. Cytotoxicity was calculated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and 
the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Percent cell viabilities were calculated against selected 
concentrations. Cell survival curves were then calculated for the fractions showing strongest cytotoxic activities and 50 percent 
growth inhibition (GI50) values were calculated from the curve for each fraction. GI50  was defined as the concentration at which 
each cell line growth was inhibited by 50 percent. 
 
 
Results and discussion 
 
A simple water/methanol mobile phase was used to avoid any acidity or buffer content in the obtained fractions. 
Different gradients and percentage compositions of  mobile phase were tried and other conditions were optimized to finally obtain 
13 fractions as shown in Figure 2.

GC-MS and LC-DAD-ESI-MS analyses were applied and identified anticancer compounds from these fractions were 
shown in the Table 1. Compounds were identified by matching their mass spectral data with NIST-08/NBS-75K library and the 
retention index matching (http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) for GC-MS analysis, while online massbank source 
(http://www.massbank.jp/) and previous PB literature was used for LC-DAD-ESI-MS analysis. These data showed that PB is rich 
in phenolic content. Considerable amounts (as assessed by chromatographic peak areas, but not quantified) of chlorogenic acid, 
gallic acid, and relatively lower amounts of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroquinone, vanillic acid, syringic acid, 4-methyl catechol, 
syringol, catechol and pyrogallol were detected in fractions 1,2,3,5,6,7,8, whereas, anticancer fatty acids such as myristic acid, 
palmitic acid and linoleic acid were identified from fractions 10, 11, 12. To the best of our knowledge, syringol and 4-methyl 
catechol were identified for the first time from this plant.  
In recent years, plant-derived bioactive substances especially anticancer ones have gained considerable attention 
(Oueslati et al., 2012). Moreover, many plants containing phenolic compounds have been found to possess good anticancer 
activity (Cai et al., 2004; Owen et al., 2000) and based on this fact plants rich in phenolic content have been considered as 
interesting source of anticancer potential (Huang et al., 2009; Vuorela et al., 2005). This unidirectional literature and the 
difference in the mode of previous cytotoxic evaluation of PB (on hexane and chloroform fractions) by Manoharan et al., (2007), 
directed us towards the investigation of its methanol-water extract for identification of anticancer compounds especially phenolic 
ones and anticancer activity.

The cytotoxicity of obtained fractions evaluated against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCCLM3) showed 
strong cytotoxic activities for fractions 1, 7, 8, 9, 10 (50 µg/mL-400 µg/mL), while good activities for fractions 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12 
(200 µg/mL-800 µg/mL), whereas almost no activity was found for fractions 4 and 13 even at a concentration of 800 µg/mL as

shown in Table 2. A curve was plotted between percent cell viability/survival and concentration for the fractions showing strong 
activities, and 50 percent growth inhibition (GI50) values were calculated from this curve, according to the similar method 
described in literature (Sylvestre et al., 2006). The curve is shown in Figure 3. The lowest GI50 values were found to be 86.5 (±3), 
92.3 (±3), 118.9 (±3), 107.2 (±3), 126.5 (±3) for fractions 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, respectively. These values show strong activities of these 
fractions against cancer cell line that may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds especially well-known anticancer 
phenolic acids such as gallic acid and protocatechuic acid in fraction 1 (You et al., 2010; Yip et al., 2006), while syringic acid and 
catechol in fraction 7 (Babich et al., 2003), and syringol and 4-methyl catechol in fraction 8 (Morita et al., 2003). On the other 
hand, fractions 2,3 possessed p-hydroxybenzoic acid and chlorogenic acid respectively, where chlorogenic acid is a well known 
anticancer phenolic acid (Kulisic-Bilusic et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2009) but fraction 2 showed sudden strong cytotoxicity at a 
concentration of 800 µg/mL whereas fraction 3 showed cytoxicity between 400 µg/mL-800 µg/mL. Fraction 5 contained 
pyrogallol, whereas 6 contained hydroquinone and vanillic acid and all three of them, especially pyrogallol, have been cited in 
literature as anticancer agents (Yang, et al., 2009; Terasaka et al., 2005; Arisawa et al., 1984; Babich et al., 2003) and these 
fractions showed good cytotoxicity at 800 µg/mL. Since, all fractions containing phenolic constituents showed good to strong 
cytotoxic activity especially low GI50 values of fractions 1, 7, 8 may suggest the presence of a relationship of phenolic content and

cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic activities of fractions 10, 11, 12 indicate the presence of other active compounds in Polygonum 
bistorta L. such as fatty acids: myristic acid, especially linoleic acid  and palmitic acid (Sagar and Das, 1995; Salerno and Smith

1991) whereas low GI50 value of fraction 9 indicates the presence of other unknown active compounds present in it. Anticancer 
activity of these 11 out of total 13 fractions and its anticancer constituents strongly showed the remarkable importance of this 
plant in anticancer activity. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Anticancer phenolic compounds and fatty acids were identified from different fractions of methanol-water extract of 
Polygonum bistorta L. 11 fractions out of 13 possessed good to strong cytotoxicity against HCCLM3 cancer cell line that 
demonstrated good bioactivity of this herbal plant. Additionally, all of the fractions containing phenolic content showed good to 
strong cytotoxic activity and 3 out of the 5 most active fractions also exhibited phenolic content that signifies the idea that 
phenolic compounds containing plants can be interesting source of anticancer potential. However, further studies can be 
conducted to identify the unknown active constituents to fully evaluate the anticancer importance and medicinal value of this 
plant. Moreover, compounds like catechol may be dangerous at high concentration levels, hence it should be quantified to ensure 
the safe use of this plant.
