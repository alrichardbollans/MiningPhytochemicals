Abstract-Ericlisoniiie is a new indole alkaloid isolated from the stem bark of Strychrios erichsoriii. Its structure has 
been established by spectral means and confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. This is the first report of a 
vobasine-type alkaloid from thc Loganiaceac. 
INTRODUCJION (4) and its acetylated homologue f l01  5 also revealed 
Strychnos erichsonii [ 1,2], S. urbmrii [3] and S .  bowliarla [4] 
comprise the various species used for the preparation of 
curare in Columbia [5,6]. However, King has shown that 
the former plant had no curarizing effect but was rich in 
alkaloids which resinify easily [7,8]. During our detailed 
study of total alkaloids in stem barks, we have isolated 
from S. erichsonii a main alkaloid, with an unknown 
structure, which is the subject of this paper. We have 
called it erichsonine. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The major compound (l), was isolated as yellow 
needles, mp 250" (decomp.), crystallized from methanol, 
[a];(' -166". The IR (ICBr) spectrum demonstrated the 
presence of a conjugated C=O at 1630 ctn- ', as well as a 
large band at 3300 cm- I (NH and OH). The UV spectrum 
[A,, nm (log&): 237 (4.05) a'nd 318 (4.1?)] is also charac- 
teristic of a 2-acyl indole [SI, non-shifted in an  acid or 
alkaline medium. The 'K NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1 
showed at  511.40 the presence of a proton singlet, 
disappearing on deuteration, attributable to the indolic 
NH. Two other proton singlets are exchangeable by D20 
at 64.25 and 4.30 proving the existence of two hydroxyl 
groups in the molecule. A doublet of three protons a t  
61.05 ( J  = 6 Nz) supports the hypothesis of a substi- 
tution of the C-19 by a hydroxyl. In the mass spectrum, we 
observe next to the [MI+ m/z  342 (C20112,N20,), 
characteristic peaks at m / z  166 and 152 shifted to 208 and 
194 in the diacetylated derivative 2. 
Acetylation of 1 (pyridine-Ac20) at room temperature 
provided rhe di-0-acetylated de:ivative 2, crystallized 
from ethanol, mp ?,lo", [a]? -1  15". The IR (ICBr) 
spectrum exhibited bands for h" at 3430cm-'  and 0- 
acetyls at 1730 and 1745 cm-l .  Thc 'NLNMR spectrum 
confirmed the existence of two acetyl groups at 6 1.85 
(s, 3H) and 2.00 (s, 3H) (Table 1). Hot acetylation of 1 
provides the tri-O,O,N-acetyl derivative 3, crystallizcd 
from isopropyl oxide, mp 133-135", [a];: -70". The 
disappearance of'the NEI band in the IR (KBr) spectrum 
was observed. The mass spectrum of 3 indicated the 
molecular formula C26H32N206. [hd]' m/z 465. 
Comparison of the '€4 NMR spectra of erichsonine (I) 
and its acetylated derivative 2 with those of 16-epi-afhine 
- -  
certain similarities. 
Final confirmation of the structure of 1 was obtaiiied by 
single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Crystal data: 
crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, Z = 4, with IL 
= 13.073 (12), b = 12.386 (n) ,  c = 7.789 (5) A, /i = 93,4 
(2)". The data were collected with a 4-circle automatic 
difhctometer using Cu-K, (1 = 1.5418 A). From 3516 
independent collected data, 2802 [ I  > 3a(I)] were used. 
The structure was solved by direct methods [ I l ]  and

Plant material. Strpclrnos erichsonii Rich. Schomb. was col- 
lected in April 1979, from la Montagrle des Chevaux, French 
Guiana. Voucher specimens of these plants are deposited in the 
herbarium of the MuseumNational d'Histoire Naturellede Paris 
(reference CM 1079). 
Extraction. Dried and powdered stem bark (7.6 kg) was 
moistened with 2Ou/, Nazco3  soh  (5 1.) and extracted cxhaust- 
ively by perccllation with CHCI3 (lo0 1.). After concn of CHCI, 
by distillation (8 1.) the extract was triturated with 1.N I-12SO4 
(20 1.). The aq. layer was alkalinizcd to pH 9.5 with satd Na2C03 
soh  (240 g/L) and extracted with CHC13 (ca 5 1.) until a negative 
Mayer reaction was obtained. The CHCIB extracts when pooled 
were washed with H 2 0  until neutral, the CHCI, soln dried 
(Na2S04), filtered and evapd in vaciio. The total bases yielded 
58.5 g (7.7 g/kg). 
Ipolafioti oJ compounds. Crude alkaloids (58.5 g) were dis- 
solved in CHC13 and separated by CC on silica gel (Merck 7734, 
diameter 0.06-0.2 mm, 1 kg). Fractions of 200 ml vol. were 
collected. For elution CHCl3 was used first (loo0 ml, fractions 
1-S), then CI-ICI,-EtOAc (4: 1, 1400 ml, fractions 6-12), then 
EtOAc-MezCO (3:2, Zoo0 ml, fractions 13-22). After evapn of 
fractions 13-22, 15 g were obtained. 
The amorphous residue (15 g) was dissolved in 
EtOAc-Me,CO (3:2) and separated by CC on silica gel (Merck 
7734; ISOg). Fractions of l00ml were collected. For elution 
EtOAc-MezCO (3:2, 500 ml, fractions 1-5; then 1 : 1, 500 ml, 
fractions 6-10), Separation with EtOAc-Me2C0 (2:3) was 
carried on and loo0 ml (fractions 11-20) were used. The com- 
position OF the fractions was monitored by TLC. 
After evapn of fraction 11-20, 9.1 g were obtained. After 
recrystallization from MeOH, 8.0 g (1.05 g/kg) of erichsonine 
were obtained.
