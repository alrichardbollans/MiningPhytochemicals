Abstract 
The antidiabetic activity of both leaves and MJ-treated cell cultures of Morus 
nigra  was evaluated after their oral administration to streptozotocin-induced 
diabetic rats. The antidiabetic activity of extracts from leaves given to 
streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats for 10 days increased with increasing doses 
of leaves extract up to 500 mg/kg/day. The administration of 500 mg/kg/day of 
leaves extract reduced the concentration of glucose from 370 ± 7.31 mg/dl 
(control) to 154 ± 6.27 mg/dl, and a significant increase in the insulin level from 
11.3 ± 0.31 μU/ml (control) to 14.6 ± 0.43 μU/ml was recorded. 
Cell suspension  cultures were established from the young leaves of Morus 
nigra  cultivated on modified MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/l 
1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 0.2 mg/l 6-(furfurylamino)purine (kinetin). The 
changes in cell weight and flavonoid content were monitored between day zero 
and 12. The linear increase in fresh weight was found to be parallel to 
flavonoids production. Cell cultures treated with 100 μM methyl jasmonate for 
24 hours showed a noticeable increase in level of flavonoids and significant and 
more effective hypoglycemic activity than that for extract from leaves. The major 
flavonoids were isolated by TLC and HPLC and identified as rutin, quercetin, 
Morusin and cyclomorusin by co-chromatography and mass spectrometry in 
comparison to samples of authentic reference compounds. 952  A. M. A. Abd El-Mawla et al.:

Introduction 
Traditional herbal medicine has been used for centuries to treat various chronic diseases. 
There has been some anecdotal evidence to suggest that some of these medicines could 
be used in treating patients with diabetes and that they may be quite effective in improving 
the glycemic control in these patients [1–3]. Recently, there has been a growing body of 
evidence from several studies both in human subjects and animal models with diabetes 
that such herbal treatment is both safe and effective [4]. 
Substantial efforts have been made in recent years to identify both natural and synthetic 
antidiabetics. The screening of more effective and safe hypoglycemic agents has 
continued to be an important area. Furthermore, after the recommendations of WHO on 
diabetes mellitus [5], investigation on hypoglycemic agents from medicinal plants has 
become more essential. 
Evidence has shown that Morus species has been used traditionally as an antidiabetic 
herbal medication [3 6–8]. The mulberry belongs to the genus Morus  of the family 
Moraceae. There are 24 species of Morus and one subspecies, with at least 100 known 
varieties.  The mulberry is found from temperate to subtropical regions of the Northern 
hemisphere to the tropics of the Southern hemisphere, and they can grow in a wide range 
of climatic, topographical and soil conditions. These are widely spread throughout all 
regions from the tropics to the sub-arctic and from sea level to altitudes as high as 4000 m 
[9, 10]. Biologically active secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, 
glycoproteins, benzofurans etc. have been isolated and identified from different Morus 
species [3, 11–15].  
Morus nigra L., belonging to the Moraceae family, is a deciduous tree widely cultivated in 
Europe and West Asia. It has a long history of medicinal use in Chinese medicine, as a 
remedy for many kinds of diseases. Phenolic constituents of Morus nigra  fruits were 
evaluated and compared with the fruits of another species of Morus [16]. The chemical 
constituents of Morus nigra bark have been studied; in addition, three new compounds 
including two flavonoids and a new 2-phenylbenzofuran were isolated and identified 
[17, 18]. Micropropagation of Morus nigra  L. from shoot tip and nodal explants of mature 
trees was studied [19]. In addition, chalcone dimethylallyltransferase from Morus nigra  
cell cultures was studied with respect to substrate specificity [20].  
In the present work, we induced formation of biologically active flavonoids in cell cultures 
of  Morus nigra  and tested their hypoglycemic efficacy. In addition, the hypoglycemic 
activity of MJ-treated cell cultures was compared to that of leaves of Morus nigra. 
Results and Discussion 
Cell culture growth and flavonoid accumulation 
Cell cultures of Morus nigra were derived from leaf explants. A linear increase in fresh 
weight was observed between day 1 and day 7 after inoculation of cells into fresh MS   Induction of Biologically Active Flavonoids in Cell Cultures of Morus nigra and Testing …  953

medium. The major flavonoids were separated by TLC using CHCl3- MeOH- H2O (8:2:0.5) 
as solving system. Further purification of the isolated compounds was achieved by HPLC. 
The flavonoids were identified in comparison to authentic reference compounds. HPLC 
analysis of flavonoids content of untreated cell suspension cultures of Morus nigra 
revealed a little linear increase in flavonoids content between day 2 and day 8, which 
paralleled cell growth (Fig. 1).

The data are mean values of two independent experiments. 
Effect of MJ on flavonoids accumulation  
Methyl jasmonate is involved in signal transduction and induces the transcription of 
biosynthetic enzymes involved in the formation of defence compounds in plants [21]. Since 
MJ can induce the formation of secondary metabolites in other systems, we have tried to 
induce the accumulation of flavonoids in cell suspension cultures of Morus nigra  by 
treating the inoculated cells with MJ.  
The cell suspension cultures of Morus nigra (4-day-old cultures) were treated with 100 µM 
MJ and incubated for 24 h. The flavonoids were extracted and determined quantitatively by 
HPLC. Estimation of total major flavonoids was done by peak area calculation in relation to 
the peak area of an aliquot of a standard (morusin) solution. MJ at a concentration of 100 
µM induced the accumulation of total flavonoids about 12-fold and 7-fold as compared to 
the untreated cells (control) and leaves respectively (Table 1).

The four major flavonoids were isolated by preparative TLC and HPLC and identified as 
rutin (1), quercetin (2) morusin (3) and cyclomorusin (4), by co-chromatography (HPLC 
and TLC) and mass spectrometry in comparison to samples of authentic reference 
compounds. The HPLC chromatograms reveal a significant increase in both quercetin and 
morusin than others (Fig. 2).

Antidiabetic activity 
The antidiabetic activity of extracts from leaves given to streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats 
for 10 days increased with increasing doses of leaves extract up to 500 mg/kg/day. A dose 
of 500 mg/kg/day of leaves extract reduced the concentration of glucose from 370 ± 7.31 
mg/dl (control) to 154 ± 6.27 mg/dl and a significant increase in the insulin level from 11.3 
± 0.31 μU/ml (control) to 14.6 ± 0.43 μU/ml was observed (Table 2).

The hypoglycemic activity of cultured cells treated with MJ for 24 h was found to be 
significant and more effective than that of leaf extract. Cells treated with MJ reduced the 
amount of the glucose from 370 ± 7.31 mg/dl (control) to 145 ± 6.30 mg/dl and significantly 
increased the insulin level from 11.3 ± 0.31 μU/ml (control) to 15.2 ± 0.32 μU/ml (Table 2). 
It could be considered that the significant hypoglycemic action of cell suspension cultures 
is related to additive action of flavonoids induced by MJ treatment. This synergistic action 
agrees with reported data [6, 7] which proved the hypoglycemic action of Morus root bark 
to be due to synergistic or additive action of moranoline (1-deoxynojirimycin), morans 
(glycopeptides), hydrophobic flavonoids (flavones and flavanones) and 2-arylbenzofurans.

Experimental 
General procedure 
TLC was performed on silica gel 60 F254-coated aluminum sheets (Merck, Darmstadt, 
Germany). Spots were visualized by spraying with 1% w/v aluminum chloride. 
EI-MS was carried out on JEOL JMS 600 Hz (Japan). 
HPLC analysis was carried on L-6200A intelligent pump and L-4000 UV detector (Merck, 
Germany).  
The insulin ELIAS was performed on Anthos Labtec Instrument; 400-700 nm wavelength 
(Austria) and Anthos Fluido 2 Microplate Washer, Biochrome Ltd, Cambridge, UK.  
Plant material 
Morus nigra plant was collected in the flowering stage from Taif region, Saudi Arabia. 
Identification of the plant was confirmed by Prof. Hosseny A. Mossallam, Faculty of 
Science, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia. 
Chemicals and kits  
All the media components were purchased from E-Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The 
authentic flavonoids; Morusin, cyclomorusin, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside 
(Rutin) were obtained from Chemistry Dept. Faculty of Sciences, Taif University, Taif, 
Saudi Arabia. Streptozotocin and Glucose (GO) assay kit were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (Germany). GenWay Insulin-ELISA kit was purchased from GenWay Biotech, San 
Diego, USA. 
Establishment and maintenance of cell suspension cultures 
Leaves of Morus nigra were used as explants source. After rinsing in water, explants were 
sterilized with 70% ethanol for few seconds, immersed in 0.1% mercuric chloride solution 
for 15 min and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The sterilized leaves were 
cultivated on 50 ml solid MS medium [22], containing 2.0 mg/l 1-naphthaleneacetic acid 
(NAA), 0.2 mg/l 6-(furfurylamino)purine (kinetin), 4 g/l phyta-gel and 30 g/l sucrose at pH 
5.75 and 25 ±2 °C in the dark.  
The resulting callus tissues were subcultured at 3-week intervals. Cell suspension cultures 
were established by transferring 4 g of callus in 50 ml liquid MS medium (without phyta 
gel) with the same growth regulator supplementation. Cultures were shaken in 300-ml 
Erlenmeyer flasks at 100 r.p.m. and 25 ±2 °C in the dark. Cell suspension cultures were 
subcultured every 7–10 days at the end of the exponential growth phase.  
Growth curve 
Ten flasks with fresh liquid MS medium (50 ml) were prepared and inoculated with 4 g of 
cultured cells of Morus nigra (day zero). Fresh weight (FW) and flavonoids content were 
determined from day zero to day 12 at two-days-intervals. Cultured cells were harvested 
by vacuum filtration.

Effect of methyl jasmonate 
4 gm (FW) of cultured cells of Morus nigra were inoculated in 50 ml MS medium. Cultured 
cells of Morus nigra in exponential phase (4-day-old cultures) were exposed to 100 μM 
methyl jasmonate (Sigma, Germany) for 24 h. Cultured cells were harvested by vacuum 
filtration, weighed and kept at −20 °C until the extraction and HPLC analysis. Growth (FW) 
and flavonoids accumulation in the cultured cells were determined. 
Extraction and phytochemical investigation 
Both the leaves and cell cultures (control & treated) of the plant (250 g) were separately 
extracted by maceration with 70% ethyl alcohol at room temperature. The phytochemical 
and chromatographic screening of the extracts from both the leaves and the treated cells 
revealed the presence of flavonoids.

Fig. 3.  Chemical structure of the isolated flavonoids 
TLC screening using CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (7.5 : 2.5 : 0.5 v/v/v) as a solvent system of 
treated cells extract indicated that they are richest in flavonoids (AlCl3  detection) and 
revealed several spots, four of them were major. They were isolated by a preparative TLC 
on silica gel G60 F254-coated glass sheets (Merck, Germany). Further purification of the 
isolated compounds was achieved by HPLC. This was performed on a reversed phase – 
(RP)-8 column (Nucleosile
  100-5; 25 cm long, 0.4 cm i.d.; Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, 
Germany) using water (A) and methanol (B) as the solvents. The following gradient was 
used: 20% B for 5 min, 20–70% B within 30 min, then isocratic elution at 70% B. The flow 
rate was 1 ml/min and the detection wavelength set to 360 nm. Their EI-mass spectra 
agreed with published data for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), quercetin, Morusin and 
cyclomorusin (Fig. 3) [15–17]. Furthermore, co-chromatography (TLC & HPLC) with 
authentic flavonoids was performed. 958  A. M. A. Abd El-Mawla et al.:   
Sci Pharm. 2011; 79: 951–961 
Quantitative determination of the flavonoids 
One gram of both fresh cells (control & treated) and fresh leaves of Morus nigra were 
separately ground with 7 ml 70% EtOH till a homogenate. The homogenate was filtered 
and the residue was re-extracted  twice with 5 ml 70% EtOH. The combined ethanolic 
extract was evaporated till dryness. The residue was re-dissolved in 1 ml MeOH and 
filtered. A serial dilution was made from this solution. The prepared solutions for both fresh 
cells and leaves of Morus nigra were used for quantitative determination of the flavonoids 
using HPLC as mentioned above in purification of the isolated compounds. Morusin in a 
concentration of 1 µg/100  µl was used as a reference compound for flavonoids. The 
quantity of total flavonoids was estimated on the bases of their peak area relative to the 
area of morusin (0.3 µg) as external standard. 
Animals and induction of diabetes 
Male Wister rats weighing 170–260 g were obtained from the experimental animal care 
centre, King Abdelaziz University, Jeddah, KSA. Induction of diabetes was performed as 
previously published [3]. The STZ was dissolved in 0.1 ml of citrate buffer (pH 4.5). 
Animals were made diabetic by injection of a single dose of STZ (60 mg/kg) intra-
peritoneally. 
STZ-treated rats were given 5% glucose in their drinking water for the first 24 h to counter 
any initial hypoglycemia. Control animals were similarly injected with vehicle only. On the 
third day, the animals were checked for the presence of glucose in the urine using 
enzymatic test strips. The animals were maintained under standard conditions of 
temperature 24±5 °C and 55±5% relative humidity with a regular 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle 
and allowed free access to standard laboratory food (Purina Chow) and water. All animals 
were treated humanely in accordance with the guideline for care of animals as set by 
WHO.  
Biological study 
As mentioned previously in literature [3]; the rats were randomly divided into four groups of 
10 animals each. The first group was received citrate buffer alone (control), the second 
was STZ-diabetic rats, the third was the STZ-diabetic rats fed orally with extract from 
leaves of Morus nigra [100–600 mg/kg/day (one hundred intervals)], and while the fourth 
was the STZ-diabetic rats fed orally with extract from MJ-treated Morus nigra cell cultures 
[100–600 mg/kg/day (one hundred intervals)] for 10 successive days. 
On the eleventh day, the rats were subjected to light ether anaesthesia and killed by 
cervical dislocation. Trunk blood was collected into heparinised chilled tubes containing 
sodium fluoride (to inhibit glycolysis). Serum was separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 
min at 3000 rpm and stored at −20 °C until determination of serum glucose and serum 
insulin concentrations. 
Serum analysis 
Glucose oxidase [23] and GenWay INS-ELISA [24] were used for estimation of serum 
blood glucose and serum insulin levels respectively.
