Phytochemical study of Mikania hoehnei yielded lupeyl acetate, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol,
campesterol, β-sitosteryl glucopyranoside, stigmasteryl glucopyranoside, benzil 2,6-
dimethoxybenzoate, luteolin, kaempferol and two sesquiterpene lactones: dehydrocostuslactone and
8β-hydroxyzaluzanin D. IR, 1H and 13C NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses and comparisons
with previously reported data were used for the identification of these compounds.

Introduction
Mikania hoehnei B. Robinson, first described by B.
Robinson in 1934, is an endemic vine found in Brazil
from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina.1,2 Only one report
has appeared dealing with the terpenoids of M. hoehnei,3
in which the presence of lupeol and stigmasterol was
indicated. We selected the entire plant for phytochemical
investigation as part of our studies on members of the
Eupatorieae.4-6
The genus Mikania has undergone taxonomic studies,
where morphologic information was considered1,7-9 and an
evaluation of the existence of correlations between the
terpenoid chemistry and the phylogeny of those species
was done.10,11 Mikania hoehnei B. Robinson belongs to
the subtribe Mikaniinae, section Mikania (L.) Willd.
(Holmes, private communication) and phytochemical
investigation of the whole plant led to the isolation of two
sesquiterpene lactones. Their structures were proposed on
the basis of spectroscopic data and comparisons of the
attributed signals with previously reported data.12-17
Although the occurrence of sesquiterpene lactones is
common in species of Mikania, guaianolides have been
found in only 3 of the 46 species studied so far, e.g. in M.
vitifolia,18 M. haenkeana19 and M. mendocina.20 There also
seems to be a remarkable difference between the
compounds identified in M. hoehnei and those reported
for other Mikania species.
Experimental
General
The IR spectra were obtained on NaCl film in a Perkin
Elmer model 1420 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR (300 MHz)
and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
DPX 300 in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard. EIMS
was obtained at 70 eV on HP 5988-A. Prep. TLC was carried
out on Si gel PF-254 (Merck), CC on Si gel 60 (0.063 a
0.200) (Merck) and VLC on Si gel 60 H (0.005 – 0.045)
(Merck).
Plant material
Mikania hoehnei B. Robinson was collected in Restinga
de Maricá, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, in July 1996, and
identified by Professor Dr. Janie G. Silva (Instituto de
Biologia da Universidade Federal Fluminense, Rio de
Janeiro). A voucher specimen (SPFR 04309) was deposited
735Sesquiterpene Lactones and other Chemical Constituents of Mikania hoehnei R.Vol. 14, No. 5, 2003
in the herbarium of the Department of Biology, FFCLRP/
USP and was used for the authentication of the species.
Extraction and fractionation
Dried and powdered whole M. hoehnei plants (2.8 kg)
were exhaustively extracted at room temperature with
hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol in successive phases.
Evaporation of solvents under reduced pressure furnished
64.0 g, 25.0 g and 35.0 g respectively, of crude extracts.
The bulk of the hexane extract (60.0 g) was chroma-
tographed over silica gel under vacuum (VLC) and eluted
with hexane, gradually increasing the polarity with ethyl
acetate and then methanol. Twelve fractions were
collected. Fraction 2 (60.0 mg) was submitted to prep. TLC
(silica gel), eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate 9:1 (v/v), to
afford 16.0 mg of lupeyl acetate. CC of fraction 10 (600.0
mg) on silica gel (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in
mixtures of increasing the polarity) followed by
precipitation (methanol) of subfr. 10.13 (45.0 mg) yielded
5.0 mg of a mixture of β-sitosterol, campesterol and
stigmasterol and 5.3 mg of a mixture of β-sitosteryl
glucopyranoside and stigmasteryl glucopyranoside.
The crude ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts were
separately suspended in MeOH-H2O 19:1 (v/v). The
solutions were partitioned first with hexane and then with
dichloromethane. After evaporation at reduced pressure,
the dichloromethane fractions were chromatographed
separately on Si gel 60 (CC) with hexane and gradually
increasing polarity, with ethyl acetate and then methanol.
All fractions monitored by TLC.
From the dichloromethane fraction (10.0 g) of crude
ethyl acetate extract, eleven fractions were collected.
Fraction 3 (45.0 mg) after prep. TLC (silica gel) eluting
with dichloromethane, afforded 1.5 mg of benzil 2,6-
dimethoxybenzoate. CC of fraction 6 (1.04 g) on silica gel
(hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in a mixture of
increasing polarity), afforded 13 subfractions. Subfr. 6.4
yielded 100.0 mg of 8β-hydroxyzaluzanin D (1).
From the dichloromethane extract (2.0 g) of crude EtOH
extract, twelve fractions were collected. Fraction 6 (93.0
mg) was submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel). Elution with
hexane-dichloromethane 3:2 afforded 5.0 mg of dehydro-
costuslactone.
The hydroalcoholic extract (2.0 g) from the crude
ethanol extract, soluble in methanol, was chromatographed
on a Sephadex LH - 20 column using methanol as eluent,
and twelve fractions were collected. Fraction 4 yielded 15.0
mg of luteolin and fraction 7 yielded 4.0 mg of kaempferol.

Results and Discussion
The chromatographic fractionation of hexane, ethyl
acetate and ethanol extracts yielded stigmasterol, β-sitosterol
and campesterol, lupeyl acetate,21 β-sitosteryl and stigmas-
teryl glucopyranosides,22 benzil 2,6-dimethoxybenzoate,23
luteolin,24 kaempferol24 and dehydrocostuslactone.13,14 The
structures were established by comparison of their
spectroscopic properties (mainly IR, 1H and 13C NMR) with
those reported in the literature and in some cases by direct
comparison with authentic samples.
Structure of the guaianolide 1 was deduced from the
IR, MS, 13C and 1H NMR spectra data and the stereoche-
mistry was defined from the coupling constants’ value J
and nOe difference correlations. This lactone has been
previously reported as a synthetic compound obtained in
the controlled acetylation of the natural guaianolide
Integrifolin (8-epi-desacylcynaropicrin).12 The IR spectrum
displayed bands at 1750 cm–1 (γ-lactone), at 1730 cm–1
(acetyl group), at 3494 cm-1 (hydroxyl group) and weak
bands at 1664, 1641 cm–1 (c=c double bonds).
Inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1
indicated several signals very close to those observed in
Zaluzanin D15. The position and the stereochemistry (β-
orientation) of hydroxyl group at C-8 were determined by
nOe correlation (Figure 1). nOe’s were observed between
the H-8 (δ 4.37) and H-13a (δ 5.62), H-7 (δ 2.98) and H-9b
(δ 2.61). In the same way, correlation of the H-3 (δ 5.50)
with H-2b (δ 2.45) and H-15a (δ 5.32) in the nOe spectrum
confirmed the α-orientation of H-3 which was attached to
the carbon atom which is linked to the acetate group, as
previously defined as Zaluzanin D (compound 2).
Just as the NMR spectrum of 2, the NMR spectrum of
guaianolide 1 exhibited two characteristic doublets at δ
6.42 and 5.62 (J 3.8 and 3.2 Hz respectively) corresponding
to hydrogens of H - 13a and H - 13b of an exocyclic
methylene group conjugated with a γ-lactone. The
exocyclic methylene groups attached to C-10 and C-4 were
characterized by two singlets at δ 4.99 (H-14a), 5.10 (H-
14b) and a pair of triplets (J 2.0 Hz) at δ 5.32 (H-15a) and
5.52 (H-15b), respectively.
736 Chaves and Oliveira J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
The stereochemistry cis of the ring junction at C-1 and
C-5 was established by the coupling constant (J 8.3 Hz)
between H-1 and H-5. In the case of 1β, 5α-trans-
guaianolide, a value of 10.0 Hz or greater is expected
according to that reported in the literature.25,26 The lactone
ring junction was confirmed to be trans (6β H, 7α H) by
the large coupling constant (J ~ 3.0 Hz) of the H -13-α-
methylene protons this is due to H-6/H-7 (J 8.9 Hz)
coupling constant.16
All other signals were in agreement with the proposed
structure of the guaianolide 1 (Table 1). Heteronuclear
multiple quantum correlation 1H – 13C (HMQC) allowed
us to assign unambiguously the signals of all carbons.
Besides the importance chemosystematic,27 sesqui-
terpene lactone posseses a wide spectrum of biological
activity.28 Zaluzanin C, Zaluzanin D and its derivatives
have shown several biological activities, such as activity
against the P 388 lymphocytic leukemia in vitro,29,30
antifungal activity,31,32 inhibitory activity on nitric oxide
production and nuclear fator KB,33 inhibitory activity on
ethanol absorption.34
On the basis of the above data, we conclude that M.
hoehnei belongs to the Brazilian Mikania species groups,
which produce sesquiterpene lactones. As other authors
have also reported,4,11 we conclude after analysis of all this
information that it is too early to establish correlations
between the terpene chemistry and the morphology of this
huge genus.
