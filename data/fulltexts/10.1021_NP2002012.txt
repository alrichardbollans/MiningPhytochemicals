hydroxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide (4a), have been isolated from the leaves of Croton 
gratissimus.  The acetyl derivative of 8 and 4a were evaluated against a chloroquine sensitive 
(CQS) strain of Plasmodium falciparum (D10).

     Croton gratissimus Burch. (C. zambesicus Müll. Arg.; C. microbotryus Pax.) (Euphorbiaceae) 
grows on stony hillsides as a semi-deciduous tree species throughout much of the warmer and 
drier regions from South Africa, northeastwards to the horn of Africa.  The leaves of this plant 
are ground with goat fat and those of two other Croton L. species, and the resulting paste is 
heated on coals and the fumes inhaled as a cure for insomnia.1 A tea made from the leaves is 
taken for coughs in Botswana.2 Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk3 documented C. gratissimus as a 
remedy for fever, for treating bleeding gums and eye disorders, and as an ingredient used to 
"smoke" rheumatic patients. In South Africa, the leaves are dried and smoked for influenza, 
colds, and fevers.4  The traditional use of this species for treating fevers, intermittent or 
otherwise, indicates its likely application as an antimalarial, since it is employed as such within 
the malaria endemic-region of southern Africa.  In Nigeria, bark infusions of the species (as C. 
zambesicus) are reported to treat malaria.5  Accordingly, crude dichloromethane extracts of 
South African leaves of C. gratissimus have previously been investigated for antiplasmodial 
activity in vitro and shown to have an IC50 value of 3.5 µg/mL;6 the constituent(s) responsible 
were not identified.  The stem bark of Croton gratissimus has been reported to yield four 
cembranoids, namely, (+)-(1R*,2S*,7S*,8S*,12R*)-7,8-epoxy-2,12-cyclocembra-3E,10Z-dien-
20,10-olide, (+)-(1R*,10R*)-cembra-2E,4E,7E,11Z-tetraen-20,10-olide, (+)-(1R*,4S*,10R*)-4-
hydroxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide (4a), and (-)-(1R*,4R*,10R*)-4-hydroxycembra-
2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide, in addition to lupeol, 4(15)-eudesmene-1β,6α-diol, and α-glutinol.7 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
     The combined hexane and methylene chloride extracts (showed to be similar by TLC 
analysis) and the ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of C. gratissimus were  separated using 
repeated column chromatography over silica gel to yield ten new cembranolides, 1-10, all of 
which were colorless oils.  These were obtained together with six known compounds, eudesm-
4(15)-ene-1β,6α-diol,8 α-glutinol,9 lupeol,10 (+)-(1R*,4S*,10R*)-4-hydroxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-
trien-20,10-olide (4a), and (+)-(1R*,10R*)-cembra-2E,4E,7E,11Z-tetraen-20,10-olide, which 
have been isolated previously from the bark of this species,7 and 24-ethylcholesta-4,22-dien-3-
one.11  NMR analysis showed that purified cembranolides are unstable on standing, but appear to 
be stable in the unpurified form.

     Compound 1 was identified as (-)-(1R*,4R*,10R*)-4-methoxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-
olide.  The NMR spectra were very similar to those of (-)-(1R*,4R*,10R*)-4-hydroxycembra-
2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide (1a), previously isolated from the bark, for which the relative 
configuration was deduced by comparison with that of the crystalline (+)-(1R*,2S*, 
7S*,8S*,12R*)-7,8-epoxy-2,12-cyclocembra-3E,10Z-dien-20,10-olide isolated from the same 
source.7  The HRMS indicated a molecular formula of C21H32O3 and the FTIR spectrum gave an 
absorption band at 1759 cm-1, consistent with an α,β–unsaturated γ-lactone, a functional group 
present in all cembranolides isolated.12  The 13C NMR spectrum displayed twenty-one carbon 
resonances, including those of a carbonyl carbon (δC 174.2, C-20), six olefinic carbons (δC 149.6, 
135.8, 134.0, 133.5, 131.7 and
 
129.4), an oxymethine (δC 80.3), and five methyl group carbon (δC 
50.4, δC 20.7, δC 22.3, δC 19.5, and δC 16.3).  The 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of 
four olefinic proton resonances, one at δH 6.98 (brd, J=1.8 Hz) and three overlapping resonances 
at δH 5.40 (m), a methoxy (δH 3.15), four methyl group proton resonances at δH 1.63 (s), δH 1.25 
(s), δH 0.91 (d, J = 6.6 Hz) and δH 0.86 (d, J = 6.6 Hz), one vinylic methyl group, and the 
presence of an isopropyl group, as in compounds previously isolated from the bark extract.7  The 
two methyl group proton doublets (H3-16, H3-17) coupled to a methine proton resonance at δH 
1.62 (H-15), which was superimposed with the H-1 resonance confirming the presence of 
isopropyl group.  The H-1 resonance was coupled to a two olefinic proton resonance at δH 5.40 
(H-2, H-3) that showed no further coupling.  The HMBC spectrum showed correlations of the H-
2/3 with the C-1 (δC 48.9), C-4 (δC 77.2), C-5 (δC 43.7), and C-18 (δC 22.3) resonances.  The 
methoxy proton showed a correlation in the HMBC spectrum with the C-4 resonance, indicating 
its attachment to C-4, and the C-4 resonance showed correlations with H3-18 and one of a pair of 
methylene group proton resonances at δH 1.85 (H-5).  This proton resonance showed coupling 
with δH 2.35 (m) and 1.63 (m) at C-6, which, in turn, showed coupling with an olefinic proton 
(H-7, δH 5.40).  The H-7 showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-6 (δC 25.5), C-
19 (δC 16.3), and C-9 resonances (δC 44.8). The magnitude of the 13C NMR chemical shift of a 
vinylic methyl carbon resonance has been used by Crombie et al.13 and Olsson et al.14 to 
determine the configuration of a methyl-substituted double bond. Lange and Lee reported that a 
vinylic methyl group carbon resonance value of < 20 ppm is indicative of an E configuration, 
whereas a carbon resonance value of > 20 ppm is indicative of a Z configuration.15  As the 
chemical shift of the C-19 methyl carbon occurred at δC 16.3 an E geometry is indicated for the 
 5 
 
 
∆7 – double bond and hence the H3-19 methyl group was placed trans to H-7.13-15  The H2-9 
resonances (δ 2.81, 2.05, m) were seen to be coupled with the H-10 resonance (δH 5.02, brs, W1/2 
= 19.7 Hz) which showed further coupling with the H-11 resonance (δH 6.98) of the α,β–
unsaturated γ-lactone.  The lactone carbonyl carbon exhibited correlations in the HMBC 
spectrum with the H2-13 resonances (δH 2.15, 2.35, m).  The H2-13 resonances were coupled to 
the two H-14 resonances (δH 1.95 (m), 1.50 (m), which showed coupling with the previously 
assigned H-1 resonance.  H-1 was arbitrarily assigned as α, as in compound 1a,7 and exhibited a 
correlation in the NOESY spectrum with the H3-18 methyl group indicating it was also α and 
then the methoxy group at C-4 was in the β configuration.  A correlation between the methoxy 
group proton resonance and the isopropyl group resonances (H3-16 and H3-17) was also 
observed, supporting a β configuration of the isopropyl group.  The broad multiplet (W1/2 = 19.7 
Hz) common in the series isolated from the bark and leaves of the same species indicated that H-
10 is β in all the compounds isolated.7  The H-10 resonance showed correlations in the NOESY 
spectrum with H-11 and the H3-19 proton resonances, showing that both are on the β–face of the 
molecule, as illustrated in Figure 1.  The conformation adopted by the molecule results in 
substituents attached to sp2 carbons, pointing above or below the general plane of the molecule.  
The specific rotation for compound 1 was found to be - 11.5.  Therefore, the structure of 
compound 1 was determined as (-)-(1R*,4R*,10R*)-4-methoxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-
olide. 
 
     The HRMS of compound 2 indicated a molecular formula of C21H32O4, and it was found to be 
the 1-hydroxy analogue of compound 1.  In addition to a carbonyl stretch at 1754 cm-1, the IR 
spectrum showed an OH-stretching at 3406 cm-1.  The 1H NMR and 13C NMR resonances were 
similar to those of compound 1 except for a fully substituted oxygenated carbon resonance at δC 
76.7, instead of the C-1 methine resonance. This was confirmed by HMBC correlations seen 
between the C-1 resonance and the H-3, H3-16, H3-17, and H-15 resonances.  Thus a hydroxy 
group was placed at C-1 in compound 2.  The NOESY spectrum showed a correlation between 
the H-4β methoxy group proton resonance (δH 3.13, s) and the isopropyl group H3-16 (δH 0.91 d 
J=7.0 Hz) and H3-17 (δH 0.88 d J=7.0 Hz) resonances.  Thus, these groups were placed on the β 
face, as in compound 1, and the hydroxy group was placed in the α-orientation.  The specific 
 6 
 
 
rotation for 2 was found to be - 46.4, and this compound was assigned as (–)-(1S*,4R*,10R*)-1-
hydroxy-4-methoxycembra-2E,7E,11Z- trien-20,10-olide.  
 
     Compound 3, C20H30O4, was assigned as (–)-(1S*,4S*,10R*)-1,4-dihydroxycembra-
2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide.  The IR spectrum gave an absorption band at 3421 cm-1 for a 
hydroxy group and an α,β–unsaturated γ-lactone absorption band at 1757 cm-1, as was observed 
for 1 and 2.  Compound 3 was found to be a 4-hydroxy analogue of 2.  Its NMR spectra were 
very similar to those of 2, but the methoxy group proton resonance present in 1 and 2 was absent 
and the C-4 and C-18 resonances of 3 were shifted to δC 74.3 (δC 77.2 for 2) and δC 31.1 (δC 23.0 
for 2) respectively.  The relative configuration for 3 was assumed to be the same as that of 2.  
 
     Compound 4, C20H30O4, was found to be the C-4 epimer of 3.  This was confirmed by the 
correlation between the H3-18 (1.31, s) resonance and the isopropyl group H3-16 (δH 0.90, d, J = 
6.9 Hz) and H3-17 (δH 0.86, d, J = 6.9 Hz) resonances in the NOESY spectrum.  The 13C NMR 
chemical shift for the oxygenated C-4 (δC 72.9) and C-18 (δC 28.8) for 4 differed slightly from 
those of 3 (δC 74.3 and δC 31.1).  The structure of compound 4 was proposed as (–)-
(1S*,4S*,10R*)-1,4-dihydroxycembra-2E,7E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide.  Compound 4 is the 1α-
hydroxy derivative of compound 4a, previously isolated from the bark, and re-isolated from the 
leaves in the present investigation.    
 
     Compound 5, C20H26O2, was identified as (+)-(10R*)-cembra-1E,3E,7E,11Z,15-pentaen-
20,10-olide.  The IR spectrum showed no OH band and the NMR spectra differed in having an 
additional three trisubstituted double bonds and a terminal methylene group.  The observation of 
coupled terminal methylene group proton resonances at δH 5.02 (s) and δH 5.08 (s) and a vinyl 
methyl three proton resonance at δH 1.96, instead of the H3-16 and H3-17 doublets present in the 
1H NMR spectra of compounds 1-4, indicated the presence of an isopropenyl group  at C-1 in 5.  
The C-1 resonance (δC 142.9) showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the two H2-16 
and H3-17 proton resonances and resonances at δH 6.43 (H-2, J=11.5Hz) and 6.06 (H-3, 
J=11.5Hz).  The corresponding C-3 resonance (δC 123.6) correlated in the HMBC spectrum with 
the H3-18 vinyl methyl group proton resonance at δH 1.79, indicating a conjugated ∆1, ∆3 –
system.  The NOESY spectrum showed a correlation between the terminal methylene proton 
 7 
 
 
resonances and the H-2 resonance and between the H-2 resonance and the H3-18 methyl group 
proton resonance.  Thus it was deduced that both double bonds were E.  The chemical shift of δC 
16.5 for C-18 supported this deduction.15  These coupling constants and chemical shifts were in 
agreement with those found for crotocembraneic acid and neocrotocembraneic acid that also 
have a ∆1, ∆3-double bond system.16,17  A specific rotation value of + 24.2 for 5 was determined.   
 
     Compound 6, C20H26O2, was found to be a geometric isomer of 5.  The most significant 
difference between the 13C NMR spectra of these two compounds were the differences in 
chemical shifts for the C-5 and C-18 carbon resonances, which occurred at δC 40.3 and δC 16.5,  
respectively, in 5 but at δC 31.4 and δC 24.0 in 6.  The value of the chemical shift of  δC 24.0 for 
the C-18 vinylic methyl group carbon resonance was indicative of a Z configuration of the ∆3-
double bond15 and this was confirmed by correlations in the NOESY spectrum between H-3 and 
the H3-18 resonance.  Specific rotation value of + 18.6 was measured for 6. This compound was 
assigned as (+)-(10R*)-cembra-1Z,3Z,7E,11Z,15-pentaen-20,10-olide.  
 
     Compound 7, C21H30O3, as in compound 5 has ∆1, ∆3 conjugated system with isopropyl 
substituent at C-1 and methoxy group at C-5.  The methoxy group three-proton singlet resonance 
(δH 3.26) showed a correlation in the HMBC spectrum with an oxymethine resonance (δC 86.0), 
which showed a further correlation with the H3-18 proton resonance (δC 1.76).  The 
corresponding C-18 resonance was shifted markedly upfield to δC 12.5.  The NOESY spectrum 
exhibited correlations between the H-10β resonance and the H3-19 resonance, which, in turn, 
correlated with one of the H-6 (δH 2.40) and H-5 (δH 3.59 dd J = 3.60, 7.80 Hz) resonances.  
Thus, these protons were assigned as β. Specific rotation value of + 24.2 was measured for 7. 
This compound was assigned as (+)-(5R*,10R*)-5-methoxycembra-1E,3E,7E,11Z, 15-pentaen-
20,10-olide.  
  
   
 
     Compounds 8 and 9 were found to be C-7 epimers of each other and HRESIMS analysis 
indicated both had a molecular formula of C20H30O3.  As with compound 4, they both had an 
isopropyl group at C-1, and hydroxy groups at C-1α and C-4α, but the ∆7-double bond had 
moved to the 8,19-position and a hydroxy group was found to be present at C-7.  For compound 
8 this was confirmed by correlations seen in the HMBC spectrum between the C-8 resonance (δC 
 8 
 
 
142.0) and one of the two methylene protons at C-19 resonances (δH 5.29), and between the C-19 
resonance (δC  29.9) and H-7 (δH 4.16, t, J = 7.1 Hz) and one of the H-9 resonances (δH  2.40).  In 
the COSY spectrum H-7 resonance coupled to the two H-6 proton resonances, which were 
further coupled to the two H-5 resonances in the COSY spectrum.  Similar correlations were 
observed in the NMR spectra of 9.  The 13C NMR chemical shift values for C-6, C-7, and C-19 
differed considerably between compounds 8 and 9 (see Table 2).  As with compound 4, the 
relative configuration of 8 and 9 could be determined using the NOESY spectrum.  In both cases, 
correlations could be seen between the isopropyl group methyl and H3-18 proton resonances and 
so these groups were assigned as β.  For 8, correlations were also observed in the NOESY 
spectrum between the H3-18 methyl group and the proton resonance and the H-7 proton 
resonance, which showed, in turn, a correlation with the H2-19 proton resonance.  The latter 
correlated with the H-11 proton resonance, which, in turn showed a correlation with the H-10 
resonance, establishing these as occurring on the β face, and therefore the hydroxy groups at C-1, 
C-4 and C-7 as α.  The specific rotation for compound 8 was + 100.  Compound 8 was therefore 
assigned as (+)-(1S*,4S*,7R*,10R*)-1,4,7-trihydroxycembra-2E,8(19),11Z-trien-20,10-olide.  
The change in the 13C NMR chemical shifts for the oxymethine C-7 from δC 89.8 in compound 8 
and δC 76.8 for compound 9 indicated different configuration at C-7.  This was confirmed by a 
lack of any correlation between H-7 and H3-18 in the NOESY spectrum of 9.  Thus the C-7 
hydroxy group was assigned as β in 9.  The specific rotation of 9 was - 24.8 and it was assigned 
as (–)-(1S*,4S*,7S*,10R*)-1,4,7-trihydroxycembra-2E,8(19),11Z-trien-20,10-olide.  
 
     Compound 10, C20H30O5, displayed in its NMR spectra, in addition to resonances ascribable 
to a α,β–unsaturated γ-lactone, three oxygenated fully substituted carbon resonances and two 
alkene double bonds.  The resonance at δC 76.8 showed a correlation with the two isopropyl 
group methyl doublets in the HMBC spectrum and was assigned to C-1.  This resonance also 
showed correlation, with two olefinic proton resonances at δH 5.45, d, J = 16.2 Hz and 5.71, d, J 
= 16.2 Hz which could be assigned as H-2 and H-3 of a trans-disubstituted double bond.  The C-
3 resonance showed correlations with the C-4 oxygenated carbon (δC 72.4), the C-18 methyl 
group carbon resonances, and the CH2-5 carbon resonance.  The corresponding H-5 resonances 
showed coupling with the H-6 olefinic resonance [δH 5.64 (m)], which was further coupled to the 
H-7 resonance (δH 5.55, d, J = 16.4 Hz) of the second trans-disubstituted double bond.  The H-7 
 9 
 
 
resonance showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the oxygenated C-8 resonance (δ 
83.6) and the C-19 methyl group proton resonance (δC 25.8)  
 
     The relative configuration of 10 was assigned using the NOESY spectrum. The two methyl 
proton resonances of the isopropyl group H3-16 (δC 0.84, d, J = 6.8 Hz) and H3-17 (δ 0.87, d, J = 
6.8 Hz) showed correlation, with the H3-18 (δ 1.37, s) methyl proton resonance as was seen for 
compounds 4, 8 and 9 and were likewise placed on the β – face, as was H-10. No correlations 
were seen in the NOESY spectrum with the H3-19 resonance, and so this group was assigned as 
α with the C-8 hydroxy group β.  Specific rotation of + 32.0 was determined and 10 was assigned 
as (+)-(1S*,4R*,8S*,10R*)-1,4,8–trihydroxycembra-2E,6E,11Z-trien-20,10-olide. 
 
     The acetate derivative of 8 was prepared in an attempt to produce a crystalline product for 
single crystal X-ray analysis, or a more stable compound for screening.  Unfortunately, the 
derivative was not crystalline but was stable enough to undergo in vitro antiplasmodial screening 
against P. falciparum (CQS) D10 strain.  Compounds 4a and 8a exhibited IC50 values of 20.8 
and 13.5 µg/mL, respectively, compared to chloroquine (IC50 27.0 ng/mL). 
  
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
     General Experimental Procedures. Specific rotations were measured at room temperature 
in chloroform using a JASCO P-1020 polarimeter and IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-
Elmer (2000 FTIR) spectrometer.  Samples were dissolved in chloroform and analyzed using 
NaCl plates. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 NMR spectrometer in 
deuteriochloroform (CDCl3) and the chemical shifts were recorded in ppm (parts per million) 
relative to the deuteriochloroform central line at δ 7.260 in the 1H NMR spectrum and at δ 77.23 
in the 13C NMR spectrum.  HRESIMS were determined using a Bruker MicroToF mass 
spectrometer, with an Agilent 1100 HPLC used to introduce the samples.  
      
     Plant Material. Leaves of Croton gratissimus Burch. var. gratissimus were collected in 
August 2005 from a mature tree cultivated on the campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, 
Durban, South Africa, by N. Crouch.  A voucher (Crouch 1051) retained for verification 
purposes at the KwaZulu-Natal Herbarium (NH).

     Extraction and Isolation. The ground leaves (189 g) of C. gratissimus was extracted using a 
Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h successively using hexane, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate and 
methanol.  After evaporation of the solvent in vacuo the following extracts were obtained: 
hexane (8.46 g), methylene chloride (2.55 g), ethyl acetate (8.84 g), and methanol (25.57 g).  The 
hexane and methylene chloride extracts were combined due to their similar TLC bands.  The 
combined hexane and methylene chloride extracts as well as the ethyl acetate extracts were 
examined in this study.  Column chromatography of combined hexane and methylene chloride 
extracts and ethyl acetate extract over silica gel (Merck 9385) using a 5 cm diameter by 60 cm 
length gravity column, collecting fractions (75 mL each) using a hexane/methylene chloride step 
gradient starting with 100% hexane and gradually increasing the methylene chloride 
concentration to 100%, followed by 5% methanol in methylene chloride, was used to separate 
the constituents.  Final purification was undertaken over silica gel using a 1 cm diameter by 60 
cm length gravity column with different solvents as indicated below for each compound.  The 
combined hexane and methylene chloride extracts gave the following compounds: fractions 40-
54 were repurified using CH2Cl2/hexane, 1:1 to give 5 (30 mg) and 6 (19 mg); fractions 60-73 
gave α – glutinol (47 mg) using 100% CH2Cl2, and  fractions 100-127 gave 4 (30 mg) using 
100% CH2Cl2. The ethyl acetate extract gave: fractions 10 – 19 (20% CH2Cl2 in hexane) gave

     In Vitro Antiplasmodial Activity of Compounds 4a and 8a against P. falciparum (CQS) 
D10 Strain. The test samples were tested in duplicate against the chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) 
strain of Plasmodium falciparum (D10).  Continuous in vitro cultures of asexual erythrocyte 
stages of P. falciparum were maintained using a modified method of Trager and Jensen.18 
Quantitative assessment of antiplasmodial activity in vitro was determined via the parasite lactate 
dehydrogenase assay using a modified method described by Makler.19 The two extracts were 
dissolved and diluted to give a 2 mg/mL stock solution in 10% DMSO and sonicated to enhance 
solubility.  Samples were tested as a suspension if not completely dissolved. Stock solutions 
were stored at – 20 ºC.  Further dilutions were prepared on the day of the experiment in complete 
medium. Chloroquine was used as the reference drug in all experiments.  A full dose-response 
was performed for all compounds to determine the concentration inhibiting 50% of parasite 
growth (IC50 – value).  Test samples were tested at a starting concentration of 100 µg/mL, which 
was serially diluted 2-fold in complete medium to give 10 concentrations, with the lowest 
concentration being 0.2 µg/mL. Chloroquine was tested at a starting concentration of 100 ng/mL.  
The highest concentration of solvent to which the parasites were exposed had no measurable 
effect on the parasite viability (data not shown).  The IC50 values were obtained using a non-
linear dose-response curve fitting analysis using Graph Pad Prism v. 4.0 software.
