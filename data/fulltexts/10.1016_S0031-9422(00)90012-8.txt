Abstract-Four mdole alkaloids have been Isolated and characterized from the tree bark of Alstoma muel- 
lerranu Domm One of these IS the previously known dlmertc mdole alkaloid, vlllalstomne (I) A second 
probably dunenc mdole alkaloid, alstomsldme (II), and two monomeric mdole alkaloids, alstomsme (III) 
and alstonerme (IV) are also described 
INTRODUCTION 
IN CONTINUATION of our lnvesugatlons of the alkaloidal constituents of various Alstoma 
species, we report the isolation and charactenzatlon of two new monomenc mdole alkaloids, 
one new dlmenc mdole alkaloid, and the known dlmerlc mdole alkaloid, villalstonme (I), 
from the tree bark of Alstoma muellerlana Domm (Apocynaceae).$ 
We have been unable to find a report of any previous mvestlgatlon of this species. 
Vlllalstonlne (I) 
RESULTS 
The finely ground bark was extracted successively with hgrom (7040”) and 70 % ethanol. 
From the concentrate of the ethanol extracts, the four alkaloids were separated by a com-

of B with I has subsequently been confirmed by Nordman and KumraZ by comparison of 
single crystal X-ray patterns with those of an authentic sample I has the empirical formula 
C41H48N404 and a drmenc indole structure has been assigned by Nordman and KumraZ 
from X-ray crystallographic analysis and srmultaneously by Swiss workers3 on conventtonal 
chemical evidence. Both groups agree on the absolute configuration of I on the assumptron 
that the C-15 rule 1s valid

Alkaloids of Alstoma muellerrana 341 
Chatteqee et aL4B5 have also obtamed I from A. macrophylla. They also reported that I 
gave an O-acetyl denvatlve with acetic anhydrlde-pyndme.4 Inasmuch as our alkaloid 
faded to gve such a denvatlve and gave no absorption m the IR hydroxyl regon some con- 
fusion as to the identity of the two existed This has now been resolved by the observation 
that I, when recrystalhzed from methanol, retains one methanol of crystalhzation very 
tenaciously whereas from acetone, the solvent-free base 1s obtamed * 
The second dlmenc mdole alkaloid was originally designated alkaloid A and we now 
propose the name alstomsldme (II) It possesses the emplncal formula C,,H,,N,O,t, con- 
tains 4 methoxyl groups, and forms a dlhydrochlonde

The structure of one of the monomeric mdole alkaloids, orlgmally designated alkaloid 
C and for which we now propose the name alstomsme (III), has been determined by X-ray 
analysis by Nordman and Nakatsu6 who also revised the empirical formula to CzoHzzN203. 
The alkaloid 1s an oxmdole denvatlve, forms a monohydrochlonde, and contains no 
methoxyl groups. 
Finally, the structure of the other monomenc indole alkaloid, ongmally designated 
alkaloid D and renamed alstonerme,’ has been deduced on the basis of mass spectral and 
NMR data. It has the corrected emplncal formula CZ1Hz4Nz02, contams no methoxyl 
groups and two NCHB groups. 
All of the above alkaloids were chromatographically pure (paper and TLC) * In addition 
to those reported here, there are some 18 other alkaloids m the alcohohc extract of the bark 
as Judged by paper chromatography Of these the known alstomne and tetrahydroalstonme 
were identified on the basis of R, values Work is contmumg on the lsolatlon and charac- 
tenzatlon of those remaining 
EXPERIMENTAL: 
Extractron of the tree bark of Alstoma muellenana 5 A thick slurry of the finely ground bark m hgrom 
(70-90) was allowed to stand for 24 hr and pressed dry m a fruit press Thus extractlon was repeated 5 tunes. 
* Mrs Chatteqee has informed us that her acetyl denvatlve was mdeed an artifact 
t Thus was ongmally assigned the formula C21H24_-26N202 At the time of Its lsolatlon no rehable 
molecular we&t data could be obtamed Dr. P W LeQuesne of these laboratones has now found on the 
basis of mass spectrographic data that the alkaloid probably 1s a double molecule
