Background: Ellagic acid (EA) and hydrolyzable ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols found in fruits and nuts and
implicated with potent antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherosclerotic biological properties. Unfortunately, there are no reports
on the bioavailability studies of EA or ETs in the human body. We conducted in vivo studies whereby a human subject
consumed pomegranate juice (PJ) (180 ml) containing EA (25 mg) and ETs (318 mg, as punicalagins, the major fruit
ellagitannin). Methods: A rapid plasma extraction procedure utilizing acidic precipitation of proteins, followed by HPLC-UV
analyses, was employed. Results: EA was detected in human plasma at a maximum concentration (31.9 ng/ml) after 1 h post-
ingestion but was rapidly eliminated by 4 h. The calibration curve for quantification of EA was linear (r2 = 0.9975) over the
concentration range from 1000 to 15.6 ng/ml. Conclusions: Since EA has reportedly strong affinity for proteins and poor
absorption in small animals, further studies to investigate whether the presence of free EA in human plasma may be due to its
release from the hydrolysis of ETs, facilitated by physiological pH and/or gut microflora action, is warranted. EA can be
considered as a biomarker for future human bioavailability studies involving consumption of ETs from food sources.D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Keywords: Ellagic acid; Ellagitannins; Pomegranates; Bioavailability; Human; HPLC

E-mail address: nseeram@mednet.ucla.edu (N.P. Seeram).ability and pharmacokinetics of EA administered
orally have not been adequately investigated [3] and
to the best of our knowledge have never been studied
in the human body. Data on the daily dietary intake of
EA by humans are not available and there is no
information on the proportion ingested in the form
of ETs [2]. There are also no reports of definitive
studies on the absorption and metabolism of ETs in
humans [2]. Hence, human bioavailability and phar-
macokinetic studies are necessary to determine the
fate of these bioactive dietary polyphenols which,
apart from being prevalent in foods, are also com-

herbal supplements.
Current knowledge on the bioavailability of EA
and ETs is confined to animal studies with rats and
mice [2–10]. When mice were given ETs (from
raspberries or pomegranates at 600 mg/kg body
weight, by gavage), EA was detected in the urine
(0.05% of dose) as a result of absorption and metab-
olism of ETs [4]. However, virtually no EA was
recovered from the blood or tissues of mice fed for
1 week on a diet containing 1% EA [5]. Following
oral administration of EA to rat, 10% of the dose was
excreted and detected as EA metabolites in urine and
feces [6]. The low concentrations of free EA in plasma
have been attributed to its low solubility in water [3],
and may also be due to its extensive metabolic
transformation and degradation prior to absorption.
In addition, EA has been reported to bind irreversibly
to cellular DNA and proteins, which may also account
for its limited transcellular absorption [14]. The poor
absorption of EA has been reported to impact its in
vivo anti-tumorigenic activity since it is possible that
sufficient concentrations are not present in plasma or
target cells after oral administration [2,3]. It has been
proposed that the gut microflora metabolize insoluble
EA. Since ETs are more soluble, their absorption or
that of their transformation products is facilitated [2].
Also since ETs are easily hydrolyzed, the in vivo
action of physiological pH and /or enzymatic actionFig. 1. Chemical structures of punicalagin (1), the majorby gut microflora could cause them to break down to
release EA units. However, this issue as well as the
pharmacokinetic profiles of ETs or EA in humans is
still unexplored.
Therefore, in this study we investigated the bio-
availability and pharmacokinetics of ETs and EA from
a food source in human. Our results show direct
evidence of the absorption of EA in the human body
for the first time. This was obtained after oral con-
sumption of pomegranate juice (PJ) by combining an
extraction procedure for plasma sample preparation
and an HPLC-UV system.2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subject
One male subject (one of the authors, NPS; 35;
68 kg body weight), after fasting overnight, con-
sumed 180 ml (6 oz) of pomegranate juice (used in
concentrate form for ease of consumption; obtained
from POMR Wonderful LLC, Los Angeles, CA)
containing 25 mg EA and 318 mg ETs (consisting
of punicalagin anomers, the major fruit ellagitannin;
quantification data not shown). Structures of punica-
lagin which exists as anomers (1) [9–11] and EA (2)
are shown in Fig. 1. Blood samples were collected
before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h after consump-ET found in commercial PJ, and ellagic acid (2).

2.2. Preparation of plasma samples
The EDTA blood samples were centrifuged at
3000 g for 10 min at 4 jC, and the plasma was
quickly removed and stored at  80 jC until HPLC
analyses. A 500-Al portion of plasma was adjusted to
pH 2.5 with 150 Al of 1 mol/l potassium dihydrogen
phosphate solution and 15 Al 50% phosphoric acid.
Each sample was vortex mixed with 2.5 ml acetoni-
trile for 1 min and centrifuged at 3500 g for 10 min
at 5–10 jC. The supernatant liquor was evaporated to
dryness at 35 jC in a SpeedVac (Savant, USA). The
residue was reconstituted in 100 Al methanol and 25
Al (sample volume) was injected onto an HPLC
system to determine presence and concentrations of
EA and ETs.
2.3. HPLC analyses
The HPLC system included a 600 pump, 717
Autosampler, 996 Photodiode Array Detector (PDA)
and Millenium32 Chromatography Software (all
Waters, USA); and a Zorbax SB C-18 column
(4.6 250 mm) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,
CA). The mobile phase, solvent A (2% acetic acid
in water) and solvent B (2% acetic acid in methanol),
was used under binary linear gradient conditions as
follows: 0–5 min, 99% A in B; 5–30 min, 99–40% A
in B; 31–40 min, 40–20% A in B; 41–50 min, 20–
10% A in B with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The
wavelength was monitored at 366 and 378 nm for
detection and quantification of EA (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) and ETs (as punicalagins; isolated as previously
reported [13]), respectively.
EA standard (50 Ag/ml) was solubilized in
DMSO and serially diluted to afford 500, 250,
125, 62.5, 31.25 and 15.625 ng/ml solutions. Con-
trol plasma was spiked with individual solutions and
extracted as previously outlined. Each plasma sam-
ple was separately extracted ( 3) and each sample
was injected in triplicate on the HPLC. Concentra-
tions were determined from the peak area by usingthe equation for linear regression obtained from the
calibration curve. The calibration curve was linear
(r2 = 0.9975) over the concentration range from
1000 to 15.625 ng/ml. Since 500 Al of plasma
was concentrated and reconstituted to a final volume
of 100 Al, the calculated lower limit of quantitation
(LOQ) of EA= 3 ng/ml. The recoveries of EA from
human plasma were 103%, 120%, 113 and 117%
for the concentrations 500, 250, 125, 62.5 ng/ml,
respectively.3. Results and discussion
The potent antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic
properties of commercial pomegranate juices (PJ)
have been attributed to their high content of poly-
phenols including ETs, as punicalagin anomers (1),
and EA (2) (Fig. 1) [9–13]. The HPLC chromato-
gram of PJ (Fig. 2A) used in this study shows the ETs
(as punicalagin anomers at tR 18 and 22 min, respec-
tively, as previously reported [13]) and EA (at tR 37
min, standard shown in Fig. 2B). Control plasma
showed no corresponding peaks detected in the plas-
ma sample (Fig. 2C) collected before the consump-
tion of PJ. The peaks at f tR 18.5–19 and 40 min in
control plasma were unidentified and are present in all
plasma samples so were not attributed to the presence
of PJ polyphenols or their metabolites.
ETs in intact forms were not detected in any of the
plasma samples collected after consumption of PJ.
N.P. Seeram et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 348 (2004) 63–6868However, since EA was detected, control plasma was
spiked with different concentrations of EA standard
and processed according to the extraction protocol for
quantification purposes. Fig. 2D shows the EA peak
eluting at 37 min in spiked control plasma. EA was
detected and quantified in plasma samples collected
at 0.5 h (20.5 ng/ml), 1 h (31.9 ng/ml), 2 h (22.4 ng/
ml) and 3 h (16.2 ng/ml) post-ingestion (Table 1). EA
was not detected in plasma samples collected at 4 and
6 h after consumption. It is noteworthy that peaks
were not detected at 520 nm, for absorption of
anthocyanins [15], polyphenols also present in PJ,
using this sample extraction method (data not
shown).
In conclusion, by combining an extraction proce-
dure for plasma sample preparation and an HPLC-UV
system, we have successfully obtained direct evidence
of the absorption of EA in human from a food source
for the first time. EA can be considered as a biomarker
for future human bioavailability studies involving
consumption of ETs from food sources. However,
further studies should be designed to investigate
whether the presence of free EA in human is due to
its release from the hydrolysis of ETs, facilitated by
physiological pH and/or gut microflora action. Also,
since polyphenol bioavailability and pharmacokinet-
ics would vary in human subjects, further clinical
studies with n>1 should be investigated. Dietary
interventions with ETs consumed for extended time
periods would also be useful to evaluate if intact ETs
bioaccumulate in humans as previously reported for
small animals [9,10]. Since biologically active ETs
and EA molecules have important impacts on human
health, studies on the detection of their metabolites,
methods to increase their bioavailability and strategies
to increase their concentration in blood and target
tissues are warranted.Acknowledgements
