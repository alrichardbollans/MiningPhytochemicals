Sesquiterpene lactones (STL) are a subclass of isoprenoids with many known bioactivities frequently 
found in the Asteraceae family. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made regarding the 
biochemistry of STL, and today the biosynthetic pathway of the core backbones of many STLs has been 
elucidated. Consequently, the focus has shifted to the discovery of the decorating enzymes that can 
modify the core skeleton with functional hydroxy groups. Using in vivo pathway reconstruction assays 
in heterologous organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, we have 
analyzed several cytochrome P450 enzyme genes of the CYP71AX subfamily from Helianthus annuus 
clustered in close proximity to one another on the sunflower genome. We show that one member of 
this subfamily, CYP71AX36, can catalyze the conversion of costunolide to 14-hydroxycostunolide. The 
catalytic activity of CYP71AX36 may be of use for the chemoenzymatic production of antileukemic 
14-hydroxycostunolide derivatives and other STLs of pharmaceutical interest. We also describe the 
full 2D-NMR assignment of 14-hydroxycostunolide and provide all 13C chemical shifts of the carbon 
skeleton for the first time.
Sesquiterpene lactones (STL) are a diverse group of specialized plant metabolites, particularly characteristic to 
the Asteraceae family, which contain a C15 backbone and an α-methylene γ-lactone ring1. Recently, the enzy-
matic steps leading to the basic 6,7-cis and 7,8-trans STL structures, such as costunolide (1) and inunolide, have 
been described. In this context, Liu et al.2 discovered the enzyme TpPTS/CYP71CA1 which can convert cos-
tunolide (1) to parthenolide (8) and Frey et al.3 found the biosynthetic pathway for the formation of eupatolide 
(8β-hydroxylated costunolide, (6)) from costunolide (Fig. 1). Thus, pathway reconstructions in heterologous 
hosts have confidently characterized the biosynthetic steps necessary for the biosynthesis of a set of basic STL core 
skeletons, which can serve as lead structures of many pharmaceutically interesting compounds. At the same time, 
diverse costunolide derivatives in the Asteraceae family show that this plant family holds the catalytic potency to 
introduce many stereospecific hydroxylations4. Liu et al.2 also discovered the enzyme Tp8878/CYP71CB1 which 
can introduce a 3β-group to either costunolide (1) or parthenolide (8), leading to 3β-hydroxycostunolide (2) 
or 3β-hydroxyparthenolide (9), respectively. With the basic pathway to STL core skeletons being identified, it 
is possible to characterize the next steps towards the decorations of the above-mentioned core skeletons. The 
introduction of a 14-hydroxy-group on the costunolide skeleton for example, can lead to the synthesis of several 
compounds with demonstrated pharmacological activities, such as 8β,14-dihydroxycostunolide (7)5, taraxinic 
acid (4)6 and 14-hydroxyparthenolide (10)7. Tyagi et al.7 converted parthenolide to 9β-hydroxyparthenolide (11) 
and 14-hydroxyparthenolide, (10) by modifying the bacterial enzyme CYP102A1, allowing the introduction of 
side chains on the core structure to improve the water solubility without reducing the bioactivity of parthenolide.
Recently, cytochrome P450 enzymes from several metabolic pathways have been reported to be arranged in 
gene clusters8. For cytochrome P450 enzymes in sesquiterpenoid pathways of Asteraceae, similar substrates and 
reaction types appear to be linked to specific subfamilies, such as the multi-step oxidation of un-oxidized sesqui-
terpenes in the CYP71AV1 subfamily or the use of germacrene A acid as a substrate in the CYP71BL subfamily3.

In this paper we present the elucidation of cytochrome CYP71AX36 a 14-hydroxylase from Helianthus annuus 
in yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana, that is co-localized with other CYP71AX genes in a gene cluster on chro-
mosome five.
Results and Discussion
CYP71AX36 converts costunolide to 14-hydroxycostunolide in yeast. The cDNAs of nine 
cytochrome P450 candidate genes previously identified in capitate glandular trichome transcripts3,9 were cloned 
into yeast expression vectors as previously described3. The well-established yeast expression system using the 
FPP-overproducing yeast strain EPY3009,10 was used to assess the catalytic activity of these 9 candidate P450 
cDNAs. In EPY300 background, the cDNAs responsible for the biosynthesis of STL skeletons (germacrene A 
acid, 8β-hydroxygermacrene A acid or costunolide) cloned in the vector pESC-Leu2d were co-expressed together 
with individual CYP candidate cDNA cloned in the vector pESC-Ura. This system supplies substrates in vivo and 
enabled us to examine the catalytic activities of the selected CYP enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S1). All candidates 
were tested for oxygenation activities of germacrene A acid, 8β-hydroxy-germacrene A acid and costunolide as 
previously described3. With the exception of CYP71AX36, no new enzyme product was detected. Expression 
of CYP71AX36 in the yeast strain producing costunolide (EPY300-Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR/LsCOS|Ura-
CYP71AX36) resulted in a new peak (peak 1) on the HPLC chromatogram in comparison to the control exper-
iment (EPY300-Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR/LsCOS|Ura-empty) (Fig. 2a). Peak 1 had a retention time of 5.6 min and 
a λmax of 210 nm with a UV-Vis spectrum, typical for STLs. LC-MS analysis of this compound showed a mass of 
[M + H]+ = 249.2, corresponding to the mass of mono-hydroxylated costunolide (C15H20O3) (Fig. 2b). A frag-
ment of [M + H − H2O]+  = 231.3, resulting from the loss of one water molecule, further corroborated that a 
single oxygen was incorporated to the costunolide backbone.
The observed shift in the retention time of ΔRT = 9.6 min inducted by this oxidation of costunolide (15.5 min) 
was stronger compared to other mono-hydroxylated costunolide derivatives available as reference compounds 
(8β-hydroxylation: 6.1 min, 9β-hydroxylation: 6.1 min, 15-hydroxylation: 8.0 min). We therefore assumed that 
another and more exposed position in the costunolide skeleton was hydroxylated that induced a higher shift 
in retention time. Upscaling the yeast culture to 0.5 liter enabled us to purify a sufficient amount of this novel 
product to conduct extensive NMR analyses. The structure of this compound was unambiguously identified 
as 14-hydroxycostunolide by evaluations of all 1D and 2D homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectra (Table 1, 
Supplementary Figs S1, S3–S7). The relative stereochemistry as shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 was 
derived by ROESY. A ROE between H-5 at δ 4.79 ppm and H-3ax at δ 2.10 ppm indicated an E 4(5) double-bond 
whereas ROESY correlations between H-2ax at δ 2.34 ppm and H-14 at δ 3.79 ppm as well as H-1 at δ 5.00 
ppm and H-9ax at δ 2.01 ppm established a Z 1(10) double-bond. The partially assigned 1H NMR data reported 
in the literature11 are in good accordance with our findings. The modeling of 14-hydroxycostunolide (Fig. 3, 
Supplementary Fig. S2) showed that the hydroxy-group at C14 is more exposed to solvent than those at other 
positions in the costunolide backbone, providing an explanation as to why the hydroxylation at C14 induces a 
higher shift in retention time than other hydroxy costunolides (e.g., C8 and C9 hydroxycostunolides).
We further examined whether other costunolide derivatives, such as parthenolide, can be oxidized by 
CYP71AX36, by additionally expressing parthenolide synthase (TpPTS). Expression of CYP71AX36 in the yeast 
strain endogenously producing parthenolide [EPY300-Leu2d-GAS/CR/GAO/LsCOS|Ura- TpPTS/CYP71AX36]
resulted in a new peak in the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of (C15H21O4) [M + H]+  = 265, corresponding 
to the mass of 14-hydroxyparthenolide at 4.86 min (Supplementary Fig. S11). The peak intensity was very low

and did not allow for the purification of sufficient enzyme product for NMR analysis. For the MS2 spectrum 
however, retention time and exact mass (ΔRT < 0.00 min, ΔM = −0.6 ppm) were in good accordance with the 
reference compound 14-hydroxyparthenolide (Supplementary Fig. S11). When the enzyme was offered ger-
macrene A acid or 8β-hydroxygermacrene A acid in the yeast expression system, no new enzyme product was 
detected (Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that the enzyme requires a lactone ring in the substrate to catalyze 
a hydroxylation reaction at position C14. Kinetic studies with wild type and modified CYP71AX36 may lead to a 
deeper understanding of the enzyme specificity in the future.

CYP71AX36 converts costunolide to 14-hydroxycostunolide in nicotiana benthamiana. 
Heterologously expressed CYP enzymes have previously shown different properties in different expression 
hosts3. Thus, to verify the activities of the above-mentioned enzymes, we expressed the corresponding cDNAs in 
tobacco, Nicotiana benthamiana. Similar to the yeast system, none of the candidate P450s except for CYP71AX36 
accepted three offered substrates, germacrene A acid, 8β-hydroxygermacrene A acid or costunolide. The targeted 
cDNAs were expressed in N. benthamiana leaves together with other cDNAs necessary to produce costuno-
lide. Expression was achieved by infiltrating A. tumefaciens transformed with the plasmids carrying p19/DXS, 
HaGAS1, HaGAO, LsCOS, and CYP71AX36. Extracts of tobacco leaves transiently transformed with the different 
cDNA combination described above showed a new peak in the LC-MS chromatogram compared to the control 
(Fig. 4a, peak 2, 6.29 min Peak 2 had a mass of [M + H]+ = 370.1, corresponding to the mass of a hydroxylated 
costunolide-cysteine adduct (C18H27NO4S) (Fig. 4b). The formation of SH adducts is commonly known for the 
production of α-methylene-γ-lactone STLs in Nicotiana benthamiana2,3,12. If CYP71AX36 carried out the same 
reaction in plant cells, peak 2 would correspond to 14-hydroxycostunolide-cysteine (Fig. 4c).
An extracted ion chromatogram for the mass of 14-hydroxycostunolide-glutathione (C25H37N3O8S) 
[M + H]+ = 556.2 showed another new peak compared to the control (Fig. 4a, peak 3 at 6.68 min, and 
Supplementary Fig.  S9). Indeed, a comparison of the enzyme products to the synthetic SH adducts 
proved their identity as 14-hydroxycostunolide-cysteine (peak 1, ΔRT < 0.01 min, ΔM = + 0.5 ppm) 
and 14-hydroxycostunolide-glutathione (peak 2, ΔRT < 0.01 min, ΔM = + 0.0 ppm) (Supplementary 
Figs S8–S10), based on exact mass, mass spectrum, and retention time comparison. While the amount of 
14-hydroxycostunolide-cysteine was higher than that of 14-hydroxycostunolide-glutathione, unconjugated 
14-hydroxycostunolide was not detected in transiently transformed Nicotiana extracts (Supplementary Table S2). 
Similar to the expression in yeast, CYP71AX36 did not convert germacrene A acid or 8β-hydroxygermacrene 
A acid. Collecting all yeast and tobacco data together, we concluded that the enzyme CYP71AX36 is a 
14-hydroxylase, and CPY71AX36 was submitted to the GenBank with the accession number MG765530.1.
Phylogenetic analysis. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of CYP71AX36 with other P450 
enzymes involved in sesquiterpene metabolism identified the putative structural domains and the substrate rec-
ognition sites (SRS) of the enzymes, as previously defined for LsCOS and HaG8H9 (Supplementary Fig. S12). 
CYP71AX36 shares 53% amino acid identity with Tp8878, a costunolide and parthenolide 3β-hydroxylase from 
Tanacetum parthenium2. Both costunolide-hydroxylating enzymes show a high degree of amino acid similarity 
in their SRS regions, but CYP71AX36 possesses a 4 amino acid deletion at the upstream of SRS6 that appears 
to be unique among the enzymes thus far known to be involved in STL metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S12). 
Many CYP71 P450 genes expressed in capitate glandular trichomes belong to the CYP71AX subfamily, and the 
costunolide/parthenolide 3β-hydroxylase from Tanacetum clusters with other P450 members of this family in the 
phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5a, Supplemental Data 2). One of the closest homologs to CYP71AX36 is CYP71AX30 
from Xanthium strumarium, which was recently considered as a candidate for the involvement in STL metabo-
lism based on gene expression studies13. A search for sub-genomic localization revealed that all enzymes thus 
far characterized in the STL metabolism of Helianthus annuus, are scattered across the genome3 (Supplementary 
Fig. S13). However, CYP71AX36 is located as a gene cluster on chromosome five where a number of other P450 
genes are co-localized. The specific CYPs are the members of the CYP71AX subfamily and they were all amplified 
from cDNA of glandular trichomes3,9 (Fig. 5b).

Role of CYP71AX36 in helianthus. Despite the diversity of STL in the Helianthus genus14–16, there is no 
report of 14-hydroxycostunolide in the Helianthus genus, while 8β,14-dihydroxycostunolide (desacetylovati-
foline) has been reported from several species of this genus5,17–20. The only currently known natural source of 
14-hydroxycostunolide is the Asteraceae plant Clibadium surinamense4,11. Remarkably, 8ß-hydroxy STLs thus 
far reported from Helianthus are normally esterified and have additional modifications on the core skeleton with 
two exceptions: 9β-hydroxycostunolide (haageanolide) (5)21 and 8β,14-dihydroxycostunolide (7)5,16–19. The above 
findings could be explained as follows: 1. CYP71AX36 can, similar to Tp8878, use hydroxylated versions of cos-
tunolide as a substrate. 2. Eupatolide, the precursor of almost all STLs in capitate glandular trichomes of sun-
flower, can be used as a substrate to generate 8β,14-dihydroxycostunolide. With the discovery of the eupatolide 
biosynthetic pathway2,3, it will be possible to test this hypothesis and to explore the plasticity of the CYP71AX36 
enzyme in future studies. This appears to be a promising approach as cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in 
sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathways often show a high substrate plasticity2,10,22–24. As our results show, the 
non-lactonized substrates germacrene A acid and 8β-hydroxygermacrene A acid are not used as a substrate by 
CYP71AX36. However, similar to the 3β-hydroxylase from Tanacetum2, the CYP71AX36 can accept other lac-
tonized substrates such as parthenolide and may also accept eupatolide. Testing eupatolide as a substrate would 
require the generation of a yeast strain that can express functional HaES, which previous studies have not yet 
accomplished3,9.
Perspectives. In our study, we present the first full 13C NMR assignment of 14-hydroxycostunolide. The 
hydroxylation of the costunolide backbone at position C14 appears to more significantly increase hydrophilicity 
than the hydroxylation at the C10 ring, given the relatively strong shift in retention time. The C14-hydroxylation 
of the costunolide backbone is a crucial step to produce several STL derivatives of pharmaceutical interest. 
CYP71AX36 accepts parthenolide as a substrate, as it is the case with the structurally similar 3β-hydroxylase 
from Tanacetum Tp8878. If the production of 14-hydroxyparthenolide can be improved, it might be possible to 
directly produce the promising antileukemic drug 14-hydroxyparthenolide7,25,26 (10) and its derivatives from 
simple sugar units in yeast culture2. Introduction of the 14-hydroxy-group to eupatolide (8β-hydroxycostunolide) 
would lead to desacetylovatifoline that has shown activity against a set of cancer cell lines5. A chemical oxidation 
could convert 14-hydroxycostunolide to taraxinic acid that has been shown to be active against leukemia stem

cells6. In addition to the α-methylene-γ-lactone, α,β-unsaturated alcohol groups such as the 14-hydroxy alcohol 
group in combination with the 1–10 double-bond can contribute to the bioactivity of STL4,27 which would in part 
explain the bioactivity of 14-hydroxylated costunolide derivatives.
experimental Section
nucleic acid extraction and pcR. Candidate P450 gene search, RNA and gDNA extraction, cDNA synthe-
sis and RACE PCR were carried out as described previously3,9,28. The analysis of CYP71AX36 gene expression by 
qPCR was tested. However, as many very similar gene sequences were expressed in the same tissue, sequencing of 
the very short qPCR amplicons could not unambiguously corroborate their identity as CYP71AX36 transcripts. 
Hence, CYP71AX36 expression was analyzed by PCR amplifying the whole open reading frame of CYP71AX36 from 
cDNA (primers 1–2, Supplementary Table S4). As a control the housekeeping gene ubiquitin was amplified using 
primers 3–4. PCR was carried out using Phusion polymerase (Phusion, Finnzymes) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions with 1 ng cDNA and 0.5 µM primers in a volume of 40 µl. The program for the amplification of CYP71AX36 
and ubiquitin was: 2:00 min; 98 °C, 39 cycles of 0:30 min 98 °C, 0:30 min 56 °C, 1:30 min 72 °C and 72 °C 2:00. PCR prod-
ucts were cloned into blunt end vector pSC-A (Agilent) and sequenced using primers 5–6.
Enzyme characterization in yeast and nicotiana benthamiana. Candidate cytochrome P450 genes 
were amplified from capitate glandular trichome cDNA with a proofreading polymerase (Phusion) introducing 
restriction sites suitable for subsequent cloning and subcloned in pJet1.2 blunt vector according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Subsequently, CYP71AX39 was cloned into the EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites (primers 7–8) 
and all other candidate genes into the EcoRI and SpeI restriction sites (primers 9–24, Supplementary Table S4) 
of the multiple cloning site 1 of pESC-Ura expression vectors (candidate vectors) as previously described9. Using 
primers (25–26, Supplementary Table S4), TpPTS was PCR amplified from pBinPlus-TpPTS2 thereby insert-
ing BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The purified PCR product was subcloned into the pJet2.1 blunt vector 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The subcloned TpPTS gene was then cut out of the vector pJet2.1–TpPTS using BamHI 
and HindIII. The vectors pESC-Ura and pESC-Ura-CYP71AX36 were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and 
additionally with SrfI to reduce the background of religated vector. All restriction enzymes were purchased from 
New England Biolabs and restriction digestion was carried out according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The 
TpPTS fragment was then ligated into the free multiple cloning site 2 of pESC-Ura and pESC-Ura-CYP71AX36 
using T4 DNA Ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The previously gener-
ated vectors Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR, Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR/HaG8H and Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR/LsCOS9,10,29 were 
used as substrate vectors. The FPP overproducing yeast strain EPY300 was subsequently transformed with a com-
bination of a substrate and a candidate vector by heat-shock transformation30,31. USER cloning of enzyme genes 
into the Agrobacterium vector was transformed as described previously3,32. The genes up-stream in the STL path-
way transiently transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana were CfDXS, HaGAS1, HaGAO, and LsCOS as previ-
ously described3. All vector constructs were sequenced using primers flanking the multiple cloning sites (primers 
27–36). Enzyme characterization in yeast was carried out as previously described9,10 and extracts of yeast cultures 
were analyzed on a HPLC-DAD reversed phase chromatography. For NMR analysis 14-hydroxycostunolide was

purified from a 0.5 L culture of yeast strain EPY300-Leu2d-GAS/GAO/CR/LsCOS| Ura-CYP71AX36 grown for 
five days in 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks in synthetic complete dropout medium using 0.1 M MOPS buffer to maintain 
the pH at 6.512. The sterile filtered yeast culture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the dried extract 
was redissolved for preparative HPLC. Thirty fractions of the 14-hydroxy-costunolide peak at 5.5 min were col-
lected and the dried pellet redissolved for NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3. Agrobacterium mediated pathway enge-
neering was performed in Nicotiana benthamiana via strain AGL1 according to a previously established standard 
procedure3,32,33.
NMR analysis. NMR analysis of the isolated compound was carried out using a 500 MHz Varian Unity 
Inova (Varian, Inc./Agilent Technologies) spectrometer. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced 
to the residual solvent signals at δH/C 7.26/77 ppm relative to TMS.1D and 2D homonuclear NMR spectra were 
measured with standard Varian pulse sequences. Adiabatic GHSQCAD, GHMBCAD and ROESYAD spectra 
were recorded using CHEMPACK 7.2 pulse sequences (implemented in Varian Vnmrj 4.2 spectrometer soft-
ware). Spectra were either processed with Vnmrj 4.2 or Spinworks 4.2.8 (Copyright 2017, K. Marat, University 
of Manitoba, Canada) The structure of 14-hydroxycostunolide was unambiguously identified by evaluation of all 
NMR spectra. Modeling of 14-hydroxycostunolide as a comparison to NMR results was performed with Chem3D 
Pro (Version 10, Cambridge Soft).
HPLC-DAD and LC-MS analysis. Extraction of transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana plants in 
methanol and yeast cultures with ethyl acetate was performed as previously described3,9. HPLC-DAD screening 
of yeast culture extracts and LC-MS analysis of extracts from transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana 
plants as well as synthetic adducts was performed as previously described3,10. LC-MS parameters for yeast enzyme 
analysis and comparison of synthetic adducts were: Agilent 1290 UHPLC with an Acquity CSHC18 column (1.7 
um particle size, 150 mm × 2.1 mm) combined with a Q Exactive Plus (ThermoFisher Scientific) mass spectrom-
eter. Solvent program: 10 min 10–70% B, 5 min 70–90% B, 1 min 90–10% B, 1 min 10% B; A: ddH2O/0.1% (v/v) 
FA, B: ACN/0.1%(v/v) FA; A/B: LC-MS-Grade; 0.3 ml/min, column temperature.: 40 °C. Q Exactive Plus mass 
spectrometer equipped with HESI-II probe. Polarity mode: Positive, Scan Mode: data-dependent MS/MS. Mass 
Range: 140–1200 amu for Full-MS. Ion source settings: Spray Voltage = 4.2 KV, Vaporizer = 380 °C, Ion Transfer 
Tube = 360 °C, S-Lens = 50%, Sheath Gas = 60, Auxiliary gas = 20, Resolution MS = 70,000 (FWHM at m/z 
200), Resolution MS2 = 17,500 (FWHM at m/z 200), Stepped Collision Energy (NCE) = 20–30–40. Costunolide 
and parthenolide were purchased from a commercial supplier (Selleck Chemicals). The reference compound 
14-hydroxycostunolide was provided by Dr. Rudi Fasan (University of Rochester). Cysteine and glutathione 
adducts of costunolide and 14-hydroxycostunolide were synthesized as previously described12.
Subgenomic localization, sequence alignment and phylogeny. The subgenomic localization of 
cytochrome P450 enzymes was analyzed with the genome browser tool provided by the compositae genome 
project (www.sunflowergenome.org). Amino acid sequences of candidate genes and characterized P450 
enzymes were aligned using BioEdit (Version 7.2.5, IbisBiosciences) and a phylogeny was calculated with the 
neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstraps in MEGA6.
