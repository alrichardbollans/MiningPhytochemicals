Hairy root cultures of Hyoscyamus muticus have been shown to 
produce stable levels of tropane alkaloids comparable to those 
found in  whole plants. I n  contrast, cell cultures of this and other 
solanaceous species produce only trace amounts of alkaloids but 
can be used for selection of metabolic variants. We have taken 
advantage of both systems and the ability to  convert between them 
in vitro in an effort to select for increased production of the tropane 
alkaloid hyoscyamine. Hairy roots were converted into cell suspen- 
sions by addition of 1 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to  
Murashige-Skoog medium (T. Murashige and F. Skoog [1962] 
Physiol Plant 15: 473-497) and screened for resistance to  the amino 
acid analog pfluorophenylalanine (PFP). Cells that could grow in 
media containing 400 PM PFP were selected and cloned from single 
cells. The resistant cells accumulated high levels of cinnamoyl 
putrescines, which share the same biosynthetic precursors as hyo- 
scyamine. Hairy root cultures were regenerated from both PFP- 
sensitive and PFP-resistant cells by removing 2,4-dichlorophenoxy- 
acetic acid from the medium. Resistance to  PFP continued to be 
expressed in regenerated roots. Higher levels of hyoscyamine were 
found in  hairy roots regenerated from PFP-resistant cells than were 
found in controls. We suggest that the precursors overproduced by 
the PFP-resistant cells can be diverted into the hyoscyamine path- 
way upon the regeneration of root cultures.

The use of root cultures for physiological and biochem- 
ical studies, in particular hairy roots obtained by transfor- 
mation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes (Chilton et al., 1982; 
Willmitzer et al., 19821, has increased steadily in recent 
years (Signs and Flores, 1990). Hairy roots can express 
root-specific pathways and have shown stable production 
of alkaloids, polyacetylenes, sesquiterpenes, naphthoqui- 
nones, and other secondary metabolites (Signs and Flores, 
1990). They have been used as a model system for the study 
of photosynthesis and photoautotrophy in roots (Flores et 
al., 1993). Hairy roots also respond to funga1 elicitors by de 
novo expression of phytoalexins and can transform xeno- 
biotics into bioactive metabolites (Flores and Curtis, 1992; 
Flores et al., 1994). In addition to producing low-molecular- 
weight secondary metabolites, hairy roots have been used

to study the biosynthesis of root-specific defense-related 
proteins (Savary and Flores, 1994). 
Many hairy root cultures of solanaceous species have 
been established to date and have been shown to produce 
tropane alkaloids (Flores and Filner, 1985; Knopp et al., 
1988). In some cases, alkaloid levels are higher in these root 
cultures than in the entire plant (Mano et al., 1986; Maldo- 
nado-Mendoza et al., 1993). We have reported that Hyoscy- 
amus muticus hairy roots constitutively produce hyoscya- 
mine (Flores and Filner, 1985), an anticholinergic agent 
used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and organo- 
phosphate poisoning, that causes smooth muscle relaxation 
(Cordell, 1981). Hyoscyamine is biosynthetically derived 
from putrescine and Phe (Fig. 1). Putrescine is the precur- 
sor for the tropine ring (Leete, 1979), and Phe is used in the 
biosynthesis of the aromatic moiety of the alkaloid. It has 
been previously accepted that hyoscyamine derives from 
the esterification of tropine with tropic acid. However, 
increasing evidence suggests that phenyllactic acid, but not 
tropic acid, is the intermediate in the biosynthesis of hyo- 
scyamine (Robins et al., 1994). 
The production of hyoscyamine is very tightly linked to 
the degree of morphological organization of the culture 
(Flores, 1987; Lindsey and Yeoman, 1983; Robins et al., 
1991a). Hyoscyamine has been shown to accumulate only 
in organized systems, such as hairy roots, but is present 
only in trace amounts or is completely absent in undiffer- 
entiated systems such as callus cultures (Flores and Filner, 
1985). Root cultures, however, have the disadvantage of 
not being readily amenable to selection pressures, such as 
can be applied to disperse cell-suspension cultures. We 
have shown that Hyoscyamus hairy roots can be converted 
into cell suspensions by growth in 2,4-D-containing me- 
dium. Conversely, these root-derived cell suspensions can 
readily be converted back to root cultures by withdrawal of 
the growth regulator (Flores, 1987). The ability to intercon- 
vert these two morphologically (and biochemically) dis- 
tinct phenotypes allowed for screening at the cell leve1 of 
genetic mutants or somaclonal variants, which may harbor 
a desired trait. The selected characteristic could then be 
expressed in root cultures regenerated from cell suspen-

proach can be used to develop root clones with improved 
yields of hyoscyamine. This was done by selection and 
subsequent regeneration of hairy root-derived cells resis- 
tant to PFP, a toxic analog of Phe (Fig. 2). The changes in 
putrescine- and Phe-derived compounds present in the 
parental and resistant cell and root clones are discussed. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Seed Germination and Establishment of Hairy 
Root Cultures 
Seeds of Hyoscyumus muticus L. obtained from the Insti- 
tut fiir Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung 
(Gatersleben, Germany) were surface sterilized with 10% 
(v/v) household bleach for 15 min, washed five times with 
sterile water, and germinated on MS medium (Murashige 
and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with 0.4 mg/L MgSO, 
7H,O, 3% SUC, 0.35% Gelrite (Scott Laboratories, West War- 
rack, RI), and 0.5 mg/L GA,. Hairy roots were established 
as described previously (Signs and Flores, 1990). Briefly, 
3-week-old seedlings and isolated leaves were inoculated 
in the stem or the petiole with a 2-day-old culture of 
Agrobucterium rhizogenes strain 15834 (American Type Cul- 
ture Collection, Rockville, MD). Hairy roots that developed 
at the infection site were transferred to MS medium sup- 
plemented with 500 mg/L cefotaxime (Claforan; Hoescht- 
Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Somerville, NJ) and subcultured 
at least once on this medium before transfer to antibiotic- 
free medium. Root tips were then subcultured in 125-mL 
Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of MS medium and 
maintained on a shaker (90 rpm) at 25°C in the dark. 
Establishment of Callus and Cell-Suspension Cultures 
Hairy root segments (1 cm) were transferred to solid 
MSD and cultured under continuous light. After 4 weeks, a 
friable green callus was obtained and subcultured onto 
fresh medium every 3 weeks. For initiation of suspension 
cultures, approximately 0.1 g of callí was transferred to 
50-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 mL of liquid MSD. 
Vigorously growing cell suspensions were maintained by 
subculturing them (1 /10 dilution) into fresh medium every 
2 weeks. AI1 cultures were maintained on a shaker (90 rpm) 
at 25°C under continuous light. 
Selection and Cloning of PFP-Resistant Cell Clones 
Cell clones resistant to PFP were obtained by sequential 
subculture of cells in MSD with increasing concentrations 
of filter-sterilized PFP (10-1000 p ~ ) .  Cultures shnwing in-

Manipulation of Tropane Alkaloid Biosynthesis 1555 
dications of resistance to the amino acid analog were sin- 
gle-cell cloned using a double filter paper technique 
adapted from Horsch and Jones (1980). Briefly, 2-week-old 
cell suspensions were filtered sequentially through nylon 
sieves with mesh sizes of 210,149,105, and 74 pm; the last 
filtrate consisted of single cells. After we determined the 
cell density with a hemocytometer, the cell suspension was 
diluted to 1000 cells/mL with MSD and 0.5 mL was placed 
on a filter paper disc (transfer disc, Whatman No. 3, 5.5 
cm). The transfer disc containing single cells was placed on 
top of a second filter paper disc (guard disc, VWR grade 
415, 9 cm). A feeder layer (1 mL) of cell aggregates (>74 
pm) from the parental cell clone was used for a11 cultures 
and placed under the guard disc. The entire plate was fed 
by solid MSD containing the same concentration of PFP 
used in the selection procedure. After 4 to 5 weeks, colonies 
developing on the transfer disc were subcultured into fresh 
solid medium containing the same concentration of PFP. 
Putative PFP-resistant calli were transferred into fresh me- 
dium every 3 weeks. These cultures were later established 
in liquid medium and subcultured as described above. The 
stability of a11 putative PFP-resistant cell clones was con- 
firmed by at least four transfers into medium lacking PFP 
before returning to PFP-containing medium. Only cell 
clones maintaining the resistant trait were maintained and 
used in further experiments. 
Hairy Root Regeneration 
PFP-resistant cells were transferred to solid MSD. After 1 
month, the resulting calli were transferred onto a hormone- 
free medium. Hairy roots developed after 4 to 5 weeks and 
were subcultured on solid MS medium. This transfer se- 
quence allowed the regeneration of hairy roots with the 
same morphological and biochemical phenotype as the 
parental root clone (see "Results"). Selection pressure was 
maintained by including 100 PM PFP in the medium 
throughout the regeneration procedure. Resistance to PFP 
was evaluated by incubating the regenerated roots in liq- 
uid MS medium with increasing concentrations of PFP 
(0-1000 p ~ ) .  As a control, hairy roots were also regener- 
ated from nonselected hairy root-derived cells and evalu- 
ated under the same conditions. 
Analysis of Cinnamoyl Putrescines 
Cinnamoyl putrescines were extracted by a method 
adapted from Berlin et al. (1982). Lyophilized cells (50 mg) 
or roots (50 mg) were homogenized in 3 mL of methanol: 
CHCl,:H,O (12:5:3, v/v/v) and centrifuged for 10 min. The 
supernatant was partitioned into two phases by addition of 
1 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of water. The methanol-water 
phase was evaporated to dryness and the resulting residue 
was dissolved in 50% methanol. Extracts were separated by 
TLC on silica gel 60 CF,,, plates (Merck, No. 13144) with 
butano1:acetic acid:water (4:1:1, v/v/v) as solvent. Cin- 
namoyl putrescines were detected under UV light, identi- 
fied by comparison to R,s of authentic standards (kindly 
provided by Prof. C. Martin, Institut National de la Recher- 
che Agronomique, Dijon, France). Quantification was done 
by scraping bands from the plates and eluting with 50% 
methanol. of the compounds was determined in a 
Beckman (DU-65) spectrophotometer. Cinnamoyl putre- 
scines were also visualized and quantified by spraying the 
TLC plates with ninhydrin (Wagner et al., 1984) and scan- 
ning with a Pharmacia LKB Ultroscan laser densitometer. 
Analysis of Hyoscyamine 
Hyoscyamine was analyzed by the method of Kamada et 
al. (1986). Briefly, lyophilized cells (100 mg) or roots (100 
mg) were extracted with CHCl,:methanol:NH,OH (15:5:1, 
v/v/v). After homogenization and incubation for 1 h at 
25"C, the extract was filtered and washed twice with 1 mL 
of chloroform. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness un- 
der air and then 5 mL of chloroform and 2 mL of 0.5 M 
sulfuric acid were added to the residue. The aqueous phase 
was adjusted to pH 10 with 28% ammonium hydroxide, 
and alkaloids were extracted twice with 1 mL of chloro- 
form. This mixture was then evaporated to dryness and 
dissolved in methanol. Extracts were separated by TLC on 
silica gel 60 CF,,, plates using to1uene:ethylacetate:dieth- 
ylamine (721, v/v/v) as solvent. Hyoscyamine was de- 
tected by spraying twice with Dragendorff's reagent and 
5% sodium nitrite (Wagner et al., 1984) and identified by 
reference to authentic standards (hyoscyamine hydrochlo- 
ride, Sigma). Quantification of hyoscyamine was per- 
formed on a Pharmacia LKB UltroScan XL laser densitom- 
eter at a fixed wavelength (A = 633 nm). 
Identity of the alkaloids was also independently con- 
firmed by a HPLC method modified from that of Fliniaux 
et al. (1993). The alkaloid extracts dissolved in methanol 
were filtered through a 0.2-mm Nalgene (Nalgo Co., Roch- 
ester, NY) cellulose acetate syringe filter. Extracts were 
analyzed using a Waters 600E system equipped with a U6K 
injector and 990 photodiode array detector. Samples were 
separated isocratically on a Nova-Pak C,, (Waters) steel 
column (3.9 X 150 mm) using a mobile phase of 12.5% 
(v/v) acetonitrile and 87.5% (v/v) aqueous phosphoric 
acid (0.3%, v/v) adjusted to pH 2.2 with triethylamine, at a 
flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Identification and quantification 
of hyoscyamine in samples was done by reference to the 
retention time of authentic hyoscyamine standards. 
Precursor Feeding Experiments 
Twelve root tips (1 cm long) were used to inoculate 
50-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 mL of MS medium. 
These cultures were grown as previously described. Radio- 
active precursors of hyoscyamine were added to both PFP- 
sensitive and PFP-resistant hairy root cultures at three 
times. On d 6, 12, and 18 of culture, 10 pL of labeled 
precursor [1,4-'4C]putrescine (37.7 kBq, 3.87 GBq/mmol; 
NEN) or [U-'4C]Phe (37.7 kBq, 14.99 GBq/mmol; ICN) 
were added to the flasks. After incubation for 24 h, the 
roots were harvested, pooled, and washed with NaCl 
(0.061 M) and immediately frozen at -80°C. Cinnamoyl 
putrescines and tropane alkaloids were extracted as de- 
scribed above from the lyophilized roots and separated by 
TLC. Incorporation of radioactivity into the various metab-

Bioscan System 200 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan Inc., Wash-
ington, DC). Radioactive hyoscyamine and caffeoyl pu-
trescine were identified by comparison to the RF values of
authentic standards after visualization under UV light or
with the reagents described previously. Radioactivity in
these bands was further determined by scraping the bands
into a scintillation vial containing 4 mL of Ecoscint A
(National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ) and measuring them
in a Beckman 5000 TA liquid scintillation spectrometer.
Total recoveries of radioactivity ranged from 85 to 90%.
RESULTS
Formation of Hairy Roots and Cell-Suspension Cultures
Twelve hairy root clones of H. muticus were established
by transformation with A. rhizogenes strain 15834. Fast
growing, friable calli were obtained from all clones by
culturing hairy roots in MSD. These cultures were then
used to initiate the cell-suspension cultures. Of all the
root-derived cell cultures tested, HyBslO was the first in
which putative resistance to PFP was detected. The resis-
tant trait was maintained in this clone after at least four
subcultures in PFP-free medium. Therefore, this clone was
used for root regeneration, subsequent characterization of
the PFP-resistant cell and root cultures, and comparison
with the parental root clone.
Selection for PFP-Resistant Cells
Two PFP-resistant cell clones (HyBslO.Rl and
HyBslO.R2) were obtained by sequential subculture of the
parental root clone HyBslO in increasing concentrations of
PFP (up to 400 U.M). The resistant cells were able to grow at
nearly normal rates in the presence of 400 /HM PFP, whereas
growth of the parental cell clone was completely inhibited
under these conditions (Fig. 3A). Both sensitive and resis-
tant clones exhibited a friable phenotype and showed sta-
ble growth for at least 15 months. The stability of the
PFP-resistant trait was evaluated by subculturing the resis-
tant clones for at least four passages in PFP-free medium
and then subculturing back into medium with 400 JU.M PFP.
Cell clones that maintained the resistant characteristic were
then cloned from single cells (see "Materials and Meth-
ods"). Single cell-derived colonies were then used in the
root-regeneration experiments. The cloning method has
also allowed for screening of cells with higher resistance to
PFP (F. Medina-Bolivar and H.E. Flores, unpublished
results).
Regeneration of Hairy Roots and Their Sensitivity to PFP
Hairy roots were regenerated from both PFP-sensitive
and PFP-resistant cell clones. The typical hairy root phe-
notype was recovered when the cells were first subcultured
in medium containing 1 mg/L 2,4-D for at least 1 month,
followed by subculture to hormone-free medium (Fig. 4).
This specific transfer sequence was required for regenera-
tion of "normal" hairy roots. When cell cultures were trans-
ferred directly to MS, abnormal root tips resulted that did
not exhibit the original morphological phenotype. All re-
generation media were supplemented with PFP to main-
tain the selection pressure on the resistant phenotype dur-
ing the differentiation process. Growth of the parental
hairy root clone (HyBslO) was completely inhibited by 100
fjiM PFP (Fig. 3B). No differences in PFP resistance were
observed between this clone and the one regenerated from
PFP-sensitive cells (HyBslO-1). Growth of root clones re-
generated from PFP-resistant cells was reduced by approx-
imately 50% of control at 100 /U.M PFP, indicating that
resistance to PFP was somewhat lower in hairy roots than
in the cells from which they were regenerated. However,

muticus (clone HyBslO.R2). Hairy root-derived cell suspensions
were transferred to MSD followed by subculture on hormone-free
medium to induce root regeneration.

these regenerated roots were still clearly resistant to PFP as 
compared to the parental root clone. 
Production of Caffeoyl Putrescine and Hyoscyamine in 
PFP-Sensitive and PFP-Resistant Cell Clones 
Caffeoyl putrescine was the major cinnamoyl putrescine 
present in both PFP-sensitive and PFP-resistant cell clones. 
The levels of this compound were quantified during a 
time-course experiment in one PFP-sensitive cell clone 
(HyBslO) and one PFP-resistant cell clone (HyBslO.R2). The 
PFP-resistant cells accumulated approximately 2 times 
more caffeoyl putrescine than the PFP-sensitive cells (Fig. 
5). The concentration of these putrescine conjugates tends 
to increase with age of the cell culture. Hyoscyamine was 
not detected in either PFP-sensitive or PFP-resistant cell 
clones, in agreement with previous results (Flores, 1987). 
Overproduction of caffeoyl putrescine has also been re- 
ported in tobacco cell cultures resistant to PFP (Berlin et al., 
1982). 
Production of Caffeoyl Putrescine and Hyoscyamine in 
PFP-Sensitive and PFP-Resistant Hairy Roots 
The time course of caffeoyl putrescine and hyoscyamine 
levels in regenerated roots is shown in Figure 6. PFP- 
resistant hairy roots (clone HyBslO.R2-4) accumulated al- 
most twice as much caffeoyl putrescine than the PFP-sen- 
sitive clone during the first few days of culture (Fig. 6). The 
concentration of caffeoyl putrescine then decreased ap- 
proximately 45% from d 3 to 12 and stabilized after d 15. 
This pattern differs markedly from that found in the pa- 
rental PFP-sensitive and PFP-resistant cells, in which the 
concentration of caffeoyl putrescine increased with time 
(Fig. 5). The levels of caffeoyl putrescine found in the 
regenerated roots were, in general, lower than those found 
in the root-derived cell cultures. 
The production of hyoscyamine showed the same gen- 
eral pattern in both PFP-sensitive and PFP-resistant hairy 
roots, namely, it remained low during the early stages of

growth and increased greatly as the root cultures reached a 
stationary phase (Fig. 6). However, PFP-resistant hairy root 
clones accumulated higher levels (nearly 2-fold) of hyoscy- 
amine than the PFP-sensitive clone (Figs. 6 and 7). No 
differences in hyoscyamine production were observed be- 
tween the parental root and the hairy roots regenerated 
from the PFP-sensitive cell clone. 
Precursor Feeding Experiments 
The results presented above suggest that the root cul- 
tures regenerated from the PFP-resistant cell clone have a 
greater ability to synthesize hyoscyamine. During the ex- 
ponential growth phase, these root cultures also show a 
clear inverse correlation between cinnamoyl putrescine 
and tropane alkaloid levels (Fig. 6). Therefore, we followed 
the course of label incorporation from ['4C]putrescine or 
[14C]Phe into these compounds in PFP-sensitive and PFP- 
resistant root cultures. Incorporation of [14CIputrescine 
into caffeoyl putrescine was higher than incorporation into 
hyoscyamine in both PFP-sensitive and PFP-resistant root 
cultures. The highest incorporation of putrescine into caf- 
feoyl putrescine was found in the 6-d-old cultures. In con- 
trast, the highest incorporation into hyoscyamine was ob-

We have described a method for enhancing hyoscyamine 
production in hairy root cultures based on selection for PFP 
resistance in hairy root-derived cell suspensions and sub- 
sequent regeneration of PFP-resistant cells into roots. Re- 
sistance to PFP in cells and roots was associated with an 
increased yield of cinnamoyl putrescines, particularly caf- 
feoyl putrescine. These results are consistent with those 
observed in PFP-resistant carrot and tobacco cells (Palmer 
and Widholm, 1975; Berlin et al., 1981). In carrot, resistance 
to PFP was associated with increased levels of free Phe, 
which possibly arose from an alteration in the Phe biosyn- 
thetic pathway (Berlin et al., 1981). However, in tobacco 
cells PFP resistance was correlated with higher activities of 
Arg decarboxylase, Orn decarboxylase, and Phe ammonia 
lyase (Berlin et al., 1982). Because these three enzymes are 
involved in the formation of cinnamoyl putrescines, their 
results suggest the coordinate regulation of putrescine and 
Phe pools to meet the demand for secondary metabolite 
synthesis. This could also apply to the biosynthesis of 
hyoscyamine in root cultures, which occurs from the same 
precursors. 
The levels of caffeoyl putrescine showed distinct changes 
in cell and root cultures of H. muticus during time-course 
experiments. Concentrations of caffeoyl putrescine in- 
creased with the age of the cell culture. In contrast, in root 
cultures the compound showed an early peak and later 
decreased as the roots became older. The feeding experi- 
ments confirmed that labeled putrescine and Phe were 
mainly directed into the formation of caffeoyl putrescine in 
the young root cultures. Our results are consistent with the

Manipulation of Tropane Alkaloid Biosynthesis 1559 
report of Parr (1992) that showed that incorporation 
of putrescine into putrescine conjugates was highest at 
the initial stage of growth in root cultures of Datuva 
stvamonium. 
Two main functions have been suggested for cinnamoyl 
putrescines in plants. Their presence seems to be correlated 
with flower development and male fertility (Cabanne et al., 
1977). It has also been suggested that these compounds are 
involved in the hypersensitive response conferring resis- 
tance to pathogens (Sun et al., 1991). Di- or polyamines 
conjugated to cinnamic acids or their derivatives can form 
alkaloids with complex structures, some of which may be 
part of a defense mechanism or connected with ion trans- 
port (Meyer and Abdallah, 1980; Smith et al., 1983). It has 
been suggested that a putrescine-utilizing mutant cell clone 
of tobacco may metabolize putrescine to y-aminobutyric 
acid via a cinnamoyl putrescine intermediate (Flores and 
Filner, 1985). Similarly, our results suggest that cinnamoyl 
putrescines may be turned over in H. muticus hairy roots 
and possibly be used as a precursor for the biosynthesis of 
hyoscyamine. We are currently studying the incorporation 
of labeled caffeoyl putrescine into hyoscyamine to further 
explore the relation between the hyoscyamine and caffeoyl 
putrescine pathways. 
The diversion of putrescine and Phe into both the cin- 
namoyl putrescine and tropane alkaloid pathways may 
represent a key regulatory point for the production of 
hyoscyamine. Previously, Parr (1992) indicated that two 
sites are important for the biosynthesis of tropane alka- 
loids: an early one at the partitioning of putrescine into 
primary versus secondary metabolites and another at the 
esterification of tropine. Since hyoscyamine and caffeoyl 
putrescine share biosynthetic precursors and the hyoscya- 
mine pathway is not expressed in cell suspensions, the 
precursors (putrescine and Phe) are likely diverted into the 
synthesis of caffeoyl putrescine. In roots, however, the 
same precursors seem to be partly diverted into hyoscya- 
mine. Our feeding experiments with PFP-sensitive and 
PFP-resistant hairy roots showed that putrescine incorpo- 
ration into hyoscyamine and caffeoyl putrescine was 
higher in the PFP-resistant clone. This suggests that pu- 
trescine pools may be limiting to hyoscyamine biosynthesis 
in H. muticus roots. 
The ability to interconvert roots and cells in vitro has 
facilitated the selection for H .  muficus metabolic variants 
discussed in this report. We propose that the same ap- 
proach could be applied to other root and cell cultures that 
express a diversity of metabolic pathways (Dhoot and Hen- 
shaw, 1977; Kurz and Constabel, 1985; Oksman-Caldentey 
and Strauss, 1986; Robins et al., 1991b; Sierra et al., 1991). 
For example, the pools of the amino acid Trp available for 
the synthesis of indole alkaloids could be increased by 
selecting for resistance to 5-methyltryptophan. Diversion 
of Trp into the alkaloid pathway could occur upon regen- 
eration of roots from the cell cultures. Severa1 indole alka- 
loids are known to occur in roots, such as the Cathavanthus 
alkaloids and camptothecin. In the Solanaceae, this ap- 
proach could also be directed toward enhancing the pro- 
duction of scopolamine. This tropane alkaloid is derived 
from hyoscyamine via two oxidative reactions catalyzed by 
hyoscyamine-6P-hydroxylase (Yun et al., 1993). Scopol- 
amine production has been reported in root cultures of 
Brugmansia candida (Giulietti et al., 1993) and Datuva spp. 
(Kamada et al., 1986; Jaziri et al., 1988; Knopp et al., 1988). 
We have recently established hairy root cultures of B. 
candida and developed a root-cell-root interconversion pro- 
toco1 for Datuva spp. (F. Medina-Bolivar and H.E. Flores, 
unpublished observations). The application of the above 
selection protocol to these root cultures is underway. 
In addition to tropane alkaloids, which are mostly con- 
stitutive intracellular secondary metabolites, hairy root cul- 
tures of H. muticus have been shown to produce and release 
sesquiterpenes (lubimin and solavetivone) upon elicitation 
with a funga1 extract of Rhizoctonia solani (Flores and Cur- 
tis, 1992; Reddy et al., 1993). Sesquiterpenes and tropane 
alkaloids share a common precursor, acetoacetate, which is 
used in the formation of both the tropine ring of hyoscya- 
mine (Leete, 1979), and in the synthesis of the isoprenoid 
unit of the sesquiterpenes (Cane, 1981). Our system can 
thus be used to study the regulation of precursor flow in 
both constitutive and inducible pathways.
