Abstract
Species of the genus Hypericum contain a rich array of unusual polyketides, however, only a small
proportion of the over 450 Hypericum species, other than the popular medicinal supplement St.
John’s Wort (H. perforatum), have even been chemically characterized. H. gentianoides, a small
annual used medicinally by Cherokee Americans, contains bioactive acylphloroglucinols. Here,
we identify acylphloroglucinol constituents of H. gentianoides and determine a potential pathway
to their synthesis. Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-
MS) and HPLC-UV indicate that the level of accumulation and profile of acylphloroglucinols in
H. gentianoides vary little seasonally when grown in a greenhouse, but do vary with development
and are highly dependent on the accession, highlighting the importance of the selection of plant
material for study. We identify the chemical structures of the nine prevalent polyketides, based on
LC/ESI-MS and hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass (Q-TOF) spectrometry; these
metabolites include one monomeric phlorisobutyrophenone (PIB) derivative and eight dimeric
acylphloroglucinols. Q-TOF spectrometry was used to identify eight additional PIB derivatives
that were not detected by LC/ESI-MS. These data lead us to propose that diacylphloroglucinols
are synthesized via modification of PIB to yield diverse phloroglucinol and filicinic acids
moieties, followed by dimerization of a phloroglucinol and a filicinic acid monomer to yield the
observed complement of diacylphloroglucinols. The metabolomics data from H. gentianoides are
accessible in PMR (http://www.metnetdb.org/pmr), a public metabolomics database with analysis
software for plants and microbial organisms.
Introduction
Specialized phytochemicals provide complex defense strategies to combat insects, fungi,
animals, or abiotic stressors, as well as attractants for pollination or dispersal. Such
phytochemicals encompass tremendous structural diversity, from terpene alkaloids as in
Digitalis purpurea (Chappell 2008), to polyketide alkylamides as in Echinacea (Wu et al.
2009), to waxes and scents (Fatland et al. 2002, Klingauf et al. 2005). Often, specialized
metabolites are contained in discreet compartments. For example, peltate glands in the
young leaves of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) accumulate monoterpenes (Iijima et al.
2004); 2-carene, α-terpinene, and limonene are concentrated in the glandular trichomes of

tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) (Schilmiller et al. 2009); and the toxic dianthrone hypericin
accumulates in nodular glands of H. perforatum (Piovan et al. 2004, Košuth et al. 2011).
Hypericum encompasses over 450 species, few of which have been chemically profiled
(Crispin and Wurtele 2013), and is the largest genus within Clusiaceae, fossils of which date
to the Late Cretaceous (90 million years ago) (Gustafsson et al. 2002). H. perforatum (St.
John’s Wort) is commonly used by humans medicinally (Ernst 2003, Birt et al. 2009).
Extracts of H. perforatum, when applied to bacterial, viral or animal systems, induce
complex, context-dependent changes to cellular and physiological functions. Medicinally
“desirable” bioactivities include: anti-viral (Axarlis et al. 1998, Maury et al. 2009), anti-
inflammatory (Hammer et al. 2007), anti-depressive (Mennini and Gobbi 2004, Butterweck
and Schmidt 2007, Kasper et al. 2008), and anti-bacterial (Franklin et al. 2009, Saddiqe et al.
2010). Furthermore, these compounds have been used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder
(Camfield et al 2011). Potentially negative effects of H. perforatum include: cytotoxicity in
HaCaT human keratinocytes (Schmitt et al. 2006); photosensitivity in mammals (Traynor et
al. 2005, Onoue et al. 2011); decreased serum concentrations of anti-retroviral and anti-
cancer pharmaceuticals in humans (De Maat et al. 2001, Caraci et al. 2011); and increased
blood pressure and heart rate in humans taking MAOIs (Tachjian et al. 2010).
A single chemical compound in H. perforatum, the acylphloroglucinol hyperforin, is
believed to be the source of the anti-depressive activity (Mennini and Gobbi 2004, Brenner
et al. 2000, Tu et al. 2010, Carpenter 2011). Hyperforin is also toxic to gram-positive
bacteria (Reichling et al. 2001, Avato et al. 2004, Joray et al. 2011), has been shown to be a
potential anticarcinogen (Schempp et al. 2002) and is an angiogenesis inhibitor (Schempp et
al. 2005). Four less studied, acylphloroglucinols, saroaspidin A, saroaspidin B, uliginosin A,
and uliginosin B have also been shown to have a variety of biological activities (Ishiguro et
al. 1987, Rocha et al. 1995, Stein et al. 2012)
H. gentianoides (Orange grass, Pineweed), is a small annual that grows throughout the
central and eastern United States and Canada (USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Service http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=HYGE). Cherokee Native Americans
used this plant to cure ailments as mild as nosebleeds and sores, and as severe as fever and
venereal diseases (Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975). Interestingly, neither hypericin nor
hyperforin have been detected in this species (Crockett et al. 2005, Hillwig et al. 2008).
Overall, H. gentianoides has been characterized by a few studies of its biological activities
(Hillwig et al. 2008, Huang et al. 2011) and in relation to its geographical distribution (Bliss
et al. 2002). Despite lacking hypericin or hyperforin, extracts from H. gentianoides, and
non-polar fractions of these extracts that are highly enriched in putative acylphloroglucinols,
have anti-inflammatory bioactivity in mouse macrophage cells (Hillwig et al. 2008). H.
gentianoides accumulates nine unusual specialized phytochemicals that have similar UV
spectra, and are postulated to be acylphloroglucinols (Hillwig et al. 2008). Three of these
compounds have been identified as saroaspidin A, uliginosin A, and hyperbrasilol C by
NMR (Hillwig 2008).
Identifying the range of existing acylphloroglucinols and the routes to their synthesis will
enhance our understanding of the development of diversity in biology, and inform the
evolutionary origin of this branch of the polyketide pathway. In part because of their high-
energy content and diverse chemical functionalities, polyketides in general provide a major
potential as biorenewable chemicals to replace petroleum as a feedstock for polymer
production (Nikolau et al. 2008, Oliver et al. 2009). Acylphloroglucinol research has
particular potential for practical application in medicinal venues. For example, given the
complex effects of hyperforin and other acylphloroglucinols on cellular and viral function,

the availability of a spectrum of acylphloroglucinols would better enable researchers to
define structure-function relationships in humans and other animals.
Here, we determine the structures of the six previously unidentified major accumulating
constituents in H. gentianoides as a monomeric and five dimeric acylphloroglucinols. We
identify nine additional monomeric acylphloroglucinols that are implicated as precursors.
Finally, we compare the accumulation patterns of these acylphloroglucinols between
vegetative and reproductive phases of growth, and across two standardized accessions.
Materials and methods
Plant material
H. gentianoides germplasm (as seeds), accessioned in the US National Germplasm System
as PI 664838 (and for studies in Figure 3a, Ames 27657), was obtained from the USDA
North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station, Ames, Iowa. Accession PI 664838 of H.
gentianoides provides the advantage that both vegetative and reproductive developmental
phases are present on a given plant simultaneously under the growth conditions used in this
study. For determinations of relative concentrations of acylphloroglucinols across shoot (leaf
and stem, with flower buds for reproductive stage) material, plants were grown in
randomized block design. Seeds were planted in a growing medium (Sunshine LC1 SUN-
COIR, Sun Gro Horticulture, Canada) in a greenhouse with natural light supplemented by an
8/16 hr photoperiod at 120 µmol m−2 s−1, in temperatures between 19–25 degrees Celsius.
Plants were watered daily, and fertilized bi-weekly. During each harvest, samples were
collected beginning at 11 am. Vegetative shoots and reproductive shoots that had
differentiated but had not begun to flower were collected from individual plants in triplicate
(approximately 5–8 shoots per biological replicate). In experiments to evaluate seasonal
variation, H. gentianoides seeds were planted in the greenhouse under the conditions
described at four-month intervals, and grown 6 months, and harvested. (Plantings in
September and January; harvests in February and June)
Plant samples were placed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, and immediately stored in liquid
nitrogen to minimize degradation of polyketides. Samples were kept in liquid nitrogen until
they were extracted.
Preparation of extracts
Before extraction of each sample, liquid nitrogen was allowed to evaporate; then, the plant
material was weighed without thawing and placed in a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar. 10 µL
of apigenin in methanol at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 was added to each sample as an
internal standard. More liquid nitrogen was added to prevent thawing, and the mixture was
finely ground with a pestle. 2 mL of methanol was added, the mixture was further ground,
and then vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was
decanted, filtered through a 0.45 micron nylon syringe filter, and the filtrate was placed
under nitrogen gas to minimize oxidation of compounds that might be present at low
concentrations and detected by mass spectrometry but not by a UV detector. Extracts were
stored in a −80°C freezer until analysis.
High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
HPLC conditions resembled those of Hillwig et al (2008). A Beckman Coulter Gold HPLC
System (Fullerton, CA) with a Detector 168 photo diode array detector was used for
determination of metabolite levels. A Synergi Max-RP 4 micron 150 × 4.6 mm column
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA 90501) was used for separation. A 10 mM ammonium acetate
(solvent A) and 9:1 v/v acetonitrile/methanol (solvent B) mobile phase was used. The

gradient consisted of 87% A/13% B in 10 min to 83% A/17% B, then to 100% B in 25 min
and held for 5 min. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min−1, the solvent gradient and flow rate was
initially described by (Ganzera et al. 2002). All solvents and the apigenin internal standard
used were HPLC grade (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS)
Samples were placed under nitrogen gas to minimize oxidation of low-accumulating
compounds that might be detected by mass spectrometry but not by a UV detector. An
Agilent Technologies Ion Trap 1100 was used for LC/ESI-MS analysis. Analytical
separation was accomplished using a Synergi Max-RP 4 micron 150 × 4.6 mm column
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA 90501) with a 10 mM ammonium acetate (solvent A) and 9:1
v/v acetonitrile/methanol (solvent B) mobile phase, with a gradient from 85% A/15% B to
80% A/20% B over a 10 min time, to 100% B over 25 min, and held at 100% B for 5
minutes. The flow rate was 0.75 mL min−1. All solvents were HPLC grade (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). This LC/ESI-MS analysis detected the nine final acylphloroglucinols but only
two of eight precursors.
Metabolite quantification based on an internal standard
The relative concentrations of the acylphloroglucinols were quantified using HPLC-photo
diode array UV, against 0.05 g (185.020 µmol) of apigenin (MW 270.24) as internal
standard. Apigenin was added at the time of extraction to each biological replicate. Extracts
derived from three independent biological replicates for each sample were analyzed, data
normalized, converted to a relative scale of nmol based on the apigenin standard, and further
normalized by dividing µmol of compound by the fresh weight of the plant material (µmol
g−1 FW).
Q-TOF mass spectrometry and spectral interpretation
High resolution mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a hybrid quadrupole
orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters SYNAPT G2 HDMS, Manchester,
U.K.) equipped with an automatic chip-based nanoelectrospray source NanoMate HD
(Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY). Ionization voltage was set to 1.09 kV, gas pressure to
1.45 psi in the negative-ion mode, and the source was controlled by CHIPSOFT 8.3.1 software
(Advion BioSciences). All samples were diluted with 5 mM ammonium acetate in
CHCl3:MeOH:IPA (1:2:4, v/v/v) and infused. The system was equipped with an integral
Advion LockSpray unit with its own reference sprayer that was controlled automatically by
the acquisition software to collect a reference scan every 10 s, for 1 s. Reference internal
calibrant (leucine enkephalin) was introduced into the lock mass sprayer at a constant flow
rate of 3 µL min−1 using an internal pump connected to the LockSpray. A single lock mass
calibration at m/z 554.2615 in the negative-ion mode was used for the complete analysis.
Spectral interpretation was performed with MASSLYNX™ V.4.1 Mass Spectrometry Software
(Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA). After peak picking, elemental formulas were calculated
and assigned on the basis of m/z values within a 6 ppm error range. Standard conditions for
plant metabolomics data (Cc Hh Oo, c ≤ 500, h ≤ 1000, o ≤ 20; −1.5 ≤ Double Bond
Equivalent ≥ 50.0) were used in these calculations.

spectra indicative of acylphloroglucinols (Hillwig et al. 2008). Three of these compounds
(MWs 446 D, 500 D, 554 D; ret times 23.418, 24.820, 24.993 min) have been previously
identified in our lab as saroaspidin A, uliginosin A, and hyperbrasilol C (Hillwig, 2008).
These spectra were also compared to the 2-D NMR of the same compounds isolated from
other species of Hypericum: saraospidin A, in H. japonicum (Ishiguro et al. 1987);
uliginosin A, in H. uliginosum (Taylor and Brooker 1969); and hyperbrasilol C, in H.
brasilense (Rocha et al. 1995).
To further identify the chemical nature of the acylphloroglucinol-like compounds in H.
gentianoides, plants of the accession PI 664838 were germinated from seeds, and grown in a
greenhouse under natural plus supplemental light. Shoots in the vegetative phase of
development were harvested from 11 months old plants (Figure 1). To minimize potential
alteration or degradation of the polyketide constituents, we reduced the exposure of plant
material and extracts to oxygen and Hypericum enzymes during pulverization, extraction
and separation (Hillwig et al. 2008). The methanolic extract was analyzed by HPLC-UV and
LC/ESI-MS (Figure S1, S2).
HPLC-UV of the H. gentianoides methanolic extract shows nine non-polar compounds with
the characteristic three-peaked UV spectra with maxima at 220, 300, and 350 nm, indicative
of acylphloroglucinols (Figure S1). Three of these nine compounds are saraospidin A,
uliginosin A, and hyperbrasilol C, based on molecular mass, retention time, UV spectra,
molecular fragmentation products, and NMR (Hillwig 2008). The extract was analyzed by
LC/ESI-MS to further determine the structures of the nine acylphloroglucinols observed at
m/z’s of 359, 497, 445, 459, 513, 499, 553, 567. Table 1 shows fragment ions and retention
times from each MS/MS spectrum, of which are shown in Figure S1. Throughout this paper,
there are several compounds that are newly identified, and do not have commonly used
names; rather than make up a series of new names, these compounds will be referred to by
abbreviations according to their chemical properties (Table 1 and Table 2).
MS/MS spectra, in negative ion mode, of H. gentianoides extract constituents saraospidin A,
uliginosin A, and hyperbrasilol C indicate that the methylene bridge that connects the two
decorated PIB molecules is the main fragmentation target (Table 1). The six additional
acylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides detected by LC/ESI-MS, which had not been
previously characterized, were identified based on the following criteria: the MS/MS spectra
for a diacylphloroglucinol should reveal the m/z of the two decorated PIB molecules
composing said diacylphloroglucinol. For example, the MS/MS spectra in negative ion
mode of hyperbrasilol C is composed of ions at 263, 277, and 289 m/z, corresponding to 3’-
prenyl-PIB (3’prenPIB), 1’-prenyl-3’-methyl-4’-oxo-PIB (1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB), and
1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB with a methyl group fragment of the methylene bridge that connected
the two monomers together, respectively. The fragmentation pattern of the three NMR
identified compounds were used to establish an additional four compounds identity as:
uliginosin B, 3,5-dihydroxy-4-isobutyryl-2-methyl-4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-6-(2,4,6-
trihydroxy-3-isobutyryl-5-methylbenzyl)cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, (abbreviated as [3’mePIB]-
[1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB]); 3,5-dihydroxy-4-4-dimethyl-2-(2-methylbutanoyl)-6-(2,4,6-
trihydroxy-3-isobutyryl-5-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)benzyl)cyclohexa-2,5-dienone (abbreviated
as [3’3’4me6’oxoPIB]-[3’prenPIB]); and 3,5-dihydroxy-2-methyl-4-(3-methybut-2-enyl)-4-
(2-methylbutanoyl)-6-(2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-isobutyryl-5-(3-methylbut-2-
enyl)benzyl)cyclohexa-2,5-dienone (abbreviated as [1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB]-[3’prenPIB] )
(Table 1). The compound at RT=23.761 min is a diacylphloroglucinol which could be either
saroaspidin B or japonicin A; both compounds have the same molecular weight and MS/MS
spectral pattern, and thus cannot be formally distinguished by MS/MS. NMR analysis was
not performed on this compound, or the other five previously unidentified
acylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides, because of the difficulty in obtaining purified

compound necessary for crystallization. Saroaspidin B is a dimer of a phloroglucinol moiety
(3’,4-dimethyl-PIB (3’4mePIB), m/z=223) and a filicinic acid moiety (3’,3’-dimethyl-6’-
oxo-PIB (3’3’me6’oxoPIB), m/z=223), while japonicin A is a dimer of two filicinic acid
moieties (3’3’me6’oxoPIB). Given that the other seven diacylphloroglucinols in H.
gentianoides are each heterodimers composed of one phloroglucinol moiety (3’-methyl-PIB
(3’mePIB), 3’4mePIB, 8-isobutyryl-2,2-dimethyl-chromene-5,7-diol (8ib22meC57diol),
3’prenPIB) and one filicinic acid moiety (3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’,3’,4-trimethyl-6’-oxo-PIB
(3’3’4me6’oxoPIB), 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB, 1’-prenyl-4,5’-dimethyl-4-oxo-PIB
(1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB), we view saroaspidin B as the more likely identity (Figure 2a). The
first-eluting compound of the nine major acylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides has the
typical characteristic acylphloroglucinol UV absorbance spectrum, eluted at 21.566 minutes,
and has a molecular weight of 360 D, [M-H]− ion at m/z 359. This compound, unlike the
other eight predominant acylphloroglucinols, should be a monoacylphloroglucinol, because
the minimum weight possible for a diacylphloroglucinol is 404 D. A modification to
1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB, specifically a 3’-prenylation as observed in 3’prenPIB, could
account for a molecular weight of 360. We predicted this compound to be 1’,3’-
diprenyl-4,5’-dimethyl-4’-oxo-PIB (1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB). Consistent with this
interpretation, the MS/MS spectrum of this compound shows an intense fragmented ion at
222 m/z; an m/z of 222 corresponds to the core cyclic ring of this compound with 4 and 5’
methyl groups but without 1’ and 3’ prenyl groups. We also expected a peak at m/z=69
corresponding to the fragmented prenyl group. However, possibly because of the low
abundance of this ion (Table 1, Figure S2), we were unable to detect this peak through Q-
TOF or LC.
One possible synthetic route for diacylphloroglucinols is that PIB is first decorated, followed
by dimerization of the resultant monomer pool to form the diacylphloroglucinols. In this
case, eight acylphloroglucinol monomers (synthesized from PIB) would be sufficient to
account for all of the H. gentianoides diacylphloroglucinols, as a variety of combinations
can be made (exemplified in Figure 2a). Furthermore, if the “monomer pool” biosynthetic
route were correct, we might expect that there would be low levels of the eight
acylphloroglucinol monomer precursors in H. gentianoides (Figure 2b).
An alternate process that could account for biosynthesis of the observed
diacylphloroglucinols is that a single diacylphloroglucinol might be formed and decorated to
form the other diacylphloroglucinols. If this “diacylphloroglucinol decoration” route were
correct, we would anticipate the presence of the precursors: partially decorated
diacylphloroglucinols, and the fully undecorated dimer (di-PIB) (Figure 2c).
Acylphloroglucinol Accumulation Differs Between Life Phases and
Accessions of H. gentianoides—To facilitate detection of acylphloroglucinol
precursors, which might be present at lower abundance or be more difficult to detect by the
methods used, we wanted H. gentianoides material with high acylphloroglucinol
concentrations and that was relatively easy to obtain. To evaluate which plant material might
have higher levels of acylphloroglucinols, the concentrations of major acylphloroglucinols
were compared under different conditions of plant growth. For these analyses, we used
accessions of H. gentianoides (Ames 27657 and PI 664838) whose seeds are being
maintained within the US National Plant Germplasm System.
First, we determined whether acylphloroglucinol accumulation in H. gentianoides varied
with the season of the year, using the greenhouse growth conditions we had previously
established for optimal plant growth. Under these conditions, supplemental light was used to
create similar 12-hour daily photoperiods throughout the year. To determine whether the
season affected the level of accumulation of acylphloroglucinols, batches of H. gentianoides

were planted at four-month intervals, allowed to grow six months, and vegetative shoots
were harvested (harvests in February and June). The growth and morphology of these
greenhouse-grown H. gentianoides plants was not visibly distinguishable, irrespective of the
growth season. A comparison of acylphloroglucinol accumulation in February versus June is
shown in Figure S3. The slope of the regression between the two time points was 1.01 and
an R-squared value of 0.994. Thus, under these growth conditions, both the development of
the H. gentianoides and the relative concentrations of each of its predominant
acylphloroglucinols are similar across these dates.
Relative concentrations of acylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides accession PI 664838 was
compared at three stages of development (seedling, mature vegetative, and flowering
reproductive) (Figure 1, 3a; Table S1). Reproductive phase shoots (stem, leaves and flower
buds) and vegetative phase shoots (stem and leaves) were harvested from plants that had
both of these stages simultaneously. Thus, levels of acylphloroglucinol accumulation were
determined for vegetative and reproductive phase shoots from the same plants. The
vegetative phase shoots accumulate higher amounts of all diacylphloroglucinols
(p<1.9×10−6 to p<0.03) in µmol per gram fresh weight tissue (µmol g−1 FW) (Figure 3b);
the least abundant major accumulating constituent, 1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB, is more than
10-fold higher in the vegetative phase (p<0.055).
Seedling shoots from the two standardized accessions Ames 27657 and PI 664838 were
evaluated for acylphloroglucinols (Figure 3b, Table S1). PI 664838 accumulated between 2
to 7.5 fold higher amounts of each of the nine major acylphloroglucinols (p<0.0005 to
p<0.039) than did Ames 27657. The greater acylphloroglucinol accumulation in seedling
shoots and in the mature vegetative shoots of PI 664838, together with the shorter time to
harvest of seedlings, led us to use seedling shoots from accession PI 664838 for further
identification of H. gentianoides acylphloroglucinols.
Hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF) detects PIB and
eight other monoacylphloroglucinols
Determination of the complement of mono- and diacylphloroglucinols present in H.
gentianoides could provide evidence for the biosynthetic route to the major accumulating
acylphloroglucinols. Because LC/ESI-MS did not reveal potential diacylphloroglucinol
intermediates, we chose a more sensitive method, hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-
flight mass (Q-TOF) spectrometry. This method not only detects molecules that might be
undetectable using LC/ESI-MS, but also yields precise data on mass (up to 10−4 of a dalton).
To experimentally determine whether the eight acylphloroglucinol monomers that we
postulated to be precursors of the diacylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides are actually
present in that species, high diacylphloroglucinol-accumulating seedlings of PI 664838 were
extracted in methanol, and these extracts were diluted with 5 mM ammonium acetate in
CHCl3:MeOH:IPA and analyzed by Q-TOF. All nine of the acylphloroglucinols detected by
LC/ESI-MS (Table 1) were also detected by Q-TOF spectrometry (Table 2).
Q-TOF spectrometry also showed compounds that could not be detected by LC/ESI-MS.
Notably, molecular weights and empirical formulas corresponding to all eight of the
monoacylphloroglucinols that could explain synthesis of the H. gentianoides major
accumulating acylphloroglucinols were identified, as was the precursor PIB and two
putative partially decorated dimers (Figure 2). To provide additional evidence as to the
identity of the putative monomers and partially decorated dimers, we employed Q-TOF-MS/
MS on these masses (Figure S4). Because of the low abundance of MS/MS fragmentation
ions at m/z values corresponding to the predicted monomers 3’4mePIB and
8ib22meC57diol, these two compounds were not included in this analysis. Using MS/MS

itself does not positively identify these compounds, however, we have been able to leverage
NMR data from saroaspidin A and hyperbrasilol C, which are composed of monomers
3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB collectively (Ishiguro et
al. 1987, Rocha et al. 1996; Hillwig 2008), for the identification. Our MS/MS analyses
indicate the methylene bridge is the primary fragmentation target, yielding 3’mePIB and
3’3’me6’oxoPIB from saroaspidin A as well as 3’prenPIB and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB from
hyperbrasilol C (Figure S2C, 2H). These ions were each fragmented again, and Q-TOF-MS/
MS/MS was employed to identify the fragmentation patterns of 3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB,
3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB. These, in turn, were directly compared to the Q-TOF-
MS/MS profiles corresponding to the predicted 3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and
1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB. Identical fragmentation patterns confirm that the Q-TOF-MS derived
masses are indeed 3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB (Figure
4, Table 3).
MS/MS analysis of these monomers indicates an isobutane is fragmented from the
isobutyryl group in 3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB. This
is the only fragmentation, with the exception of the molecular ion, present in MS/MS spectra
of 3’mePIB, and 3’3’me6’oxoPIB. MS/MS spectra for 3’prenPIB have four ions present at
m/z=151, 194, 219, and 263 (the molecular ion). The ion at 151 m/z corresponds to
fragmentation of the isobutane and prenyl group, while 194 m/z corresponds to
fragmentation of only the prenyl group, and 219 m/z is a fragmentation of only the
isobutane. MS/MS spectra of 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB follow the same pattern of fragmentation
as 3’prenPIB, in which the isobutyl and prenyl groups are the primary target, yielding ions at
166, 208, and 233 m/z (Figure S4). We cannot identify 3’4mePIB, 3’3’4me6’oxoPIB,
8ib22meC57diol, or 1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB with as great a certainty as 3’mePIB,
3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB, but the ion at m/z=291 is likely
1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB, given the primary fragmentation ion of this compound is at m/
z=222, exactly the same mass as seen in MS/MS spectra of 1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB. This is
expected given m/z=222 would correspond to a fragmentation of one prenyl group from
1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB and two fragmented prenyl groups from 1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB.
Suggestive MS/MS spectra for 1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB along with the confirmed presence of
3’mePIB, 3’3’me6’oxoPIB, 3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB indicate the m/z do indeed
correspond to the monomers. The monomers that we observed were probably not detected in
previous studies of Hypericum spp that contain diacylphloroglucinols (Taylor et al. 1969,
Ishiguro et al. 1987, Rocha et al. 1996, Huang et al. 2011) because of the detection method
or their lower abundance. Also identified by Q-TOF-MS/MS were the partially decorated
dimers [3’3’me6’oxoPIB]-[PIB] and [1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB]-[PIB] (Table 3, Figure 2C).
These partially decorated dimers are fragmented at the methylene bridge in the same way as
observed for the fully decorated dimers; yielding fragmentation ions at 195 and 223 m/z for
[3’3’me6’oxoPIB]-[PIB] and 195 and 277 m/z for [1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB]-[PIB] (Figure S4).
Discussion
The mono- and diacylphloroglucinols thus far identified from Hypericum spp. display a
wealth of structural variety (Avato et al. 2004, Gibbons et al. 2005, Manning et al. 2011). A
number of these compounds have been shown to induce diverse bioactivities when applied
to other organisms (Schempp et al. 2002, Avato et al. 2004, Mennini et al. 2004, Beerhues
2006, Hillwig et al. 2008, Henry et al. 2009, Saddiqe et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2011, Stein et
al. 2012, Zaher et al. 2012). St. John’s Wort contains a single monoacylphloroglucinol that
has been the subjects of hundreds of medicinal studies (hyperforin), but no known
diacylphloroglucinols. The biological activities of diacylphloroglucinols are a recent
research focus. Uliginosin B has anti-depressive effects when given to mice before a forced
swim stress test (Stein et al. 2012). Saroaspidin A, B, uliginosin A, B, and hyperbrasilol C

have anti-bacterial activity properties in Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus assays
(Ishiguro et al. 1987, Rocha et al. 1995, Rocha et al. 1996, Winkelmann 2001, França and
Kuster 2009). Diacylphloroglucinols can show specificity with respect to a given activity;
for example, saroaspidin A is active in anti-inflammatory assays with mouse macrophage
cells, while uliginosin A has little anti-inflammatory activity in these assays (Hillwig et al.
2008). These multiple bioactive effects, combined with the specificity of the action of
individual acylphloroglucinols, emphasize the scope of potential medical applications for
these compounds.
The major acylphloroglucinols of H. gentianoides are a single monoacylphloroglucinol and
eight diacylphloroglucinols. Three of the diacylphloroglucinols, [3’mePIB]-
[1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB], [3’3’4me6’oxoPIB]-[3’prenPIB], [1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB]-
[3’prenPIB], had not been previously described in any species. Identifying the
acylphloroglucinol constituents of H. gentianoides is a prerequisite to deciphering the
pathways by which they are biosynthesized. Ultimately, such data will be critical for
identifying the primary sequences and three-dimensional structures of enzymes and
regulatory proteins that control this pathway, and will provide an important step towards
understanding that pathway in the context of its evolution (Schmidt et al. 2003, O’Maille et
al. 2008, Ngaki et al. 2012).
From an applied aspect, the determination of the chemical nature of Hypericum polyketide
constituents is important for those who use extracts of this genus as medical supplements.
Furthermore, the availability of a wide variety of acylphloroglucinols will provides
researchers with tools to investigate the mechanisms by which members of this class of
compounds affect other organisms, and to dissect the enzymes and regulatory factors that
lead to these compounds in plants. This information sets the stage for genetic engineering of
custom acylphloroglucinols (Crispin and Wurtele 2013; http://www.metnetdb.org/pmr/) and
other polyketides, which is significant because of the potential medicinal applications.
Virtually nothing had been reported previously about the pathway leading to the
biosynthesis of diacylphloroglucinols. Here, we combine previous knowledge and our new
understanding of the acylphloroglucinols in H. gentianoides to propose a pathway leading to
the biosynthesis of diacylphloroglucinols (Figure 5) and describe a potential mechanism for
dimerization (Figure 6).
Biosynthesis of the monoacylphloroglucinol hyperforin in H. perforatum is becoming better
understood (Beerhues 2003, Soelberg et al. 2007, Karppinen 2010) and provides a possible
template for the initial steps of diacylphloroglucinol biosynthesis (Figure 5). PIB could be
derived from either pyruvate or valine in H. perforatum (Adam et al. 2002). Isotopically
labeled L-[U-13C6]-valine was preferentially incorporated into the acyl chain of hyperforin
in liquid cultures of 12 day old H. perforatum, indicating that valine is likely the major
precursor under this condition (Karppinen 2010). In H. perforatum, PIB is an intermediate of
hyperforin (Paniego et al. 1999, Adam et al. 2002, Soelberg et al. 2007, Karppinen 2010) via
its prenylation to form 3’prenPIB (Adam et al. 2002, Karppinen et al. 2007). Presumably the
early pathway to acylphloroglucinols is common among Hypericum spp; consistent with this
supposition, we identified PIB and 3’prenPIB in H. gentianoides. Either of two processes
could yield the array of diacylphloroglucinols present in H. gentianoides. 1) PIB monomers
might be decorated, and the pool of decorated monomers then dimerized (decoration of
monomer pool); and/or 2) PIB monomers might be dimerized and then the dimers might be
further modified (decoration of dimers)
Our observations, taken together, indicate that the synthesis of diacylphloroglucinols likely
occurs via a pool of decorated monomers (Figure 5). PIB and eight other

monoacylphloroglucinols, each a derivative of PIB, were detected in H. gentianoides. The
H. gentianoides monomers, in different combinations, would exactly explain the presence of
each of the diacylphloroglucinols. Thus, the particular complement of acylphloroglucinol
monomers supports the “monomer pool” concept, in which the monomers are first decorated
and then dimerized. We could not detect any completely undecorated dimers, nor six of the
eight partially decorated dimers that would be expected if diacylphloroglucinol biosynthesis
occurred by a process in which an “undecorated” acylphloroglucinol dimer is
biosynthesized, followed by a stepwise derivatization. (We did, however, detect low
concentrations of two of the eight partially decorated dimers, that would be anticipated if the
“decoration of dimers” process took place, [3’3’me6’oxoPIB]-[PIB] and
[1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB]-[PIB].) The presence of substantial concentrations of
1’3’pren4’5’me4’oxoPIB lends further support for the “monomer pool” concept. This
acylphloroglucinol is detectable through every method we have tested, and is not able to be
dimerized as the available carbons are derivatized. It would be rather convoluted to consider
that, as would be predicted by the decoration of dimer model, the plant would first dimerize
two PIB molecules, decorate them, break them apart, and then prenylate the fragmented half
as would be necessary to synthesize this monoacylphloroglucinol. The idea that one
monomer becomes fully decorated and thus accumulates as such, as would be predicted by
the decoration of monomer pool model, is much more direct.
A notable difference between hyperforin and diacylphloroglucinol biosynthesis is the
creation of a methylene bridge in diacylphloroglucinols. There is no reported mechanism
describing this reaction, however, the mechanism for EC 1.21.3.3, which forms a methylene
bridge during the formation of (S)-scoulerine from (S)-reticuline (Kutchan and Dittrich
1995), has been described. EC 1.21.3.3 has features in common with the dimerization of
acylphloroglucinols, as both involve formation of a methylene bridge between two phenolic
rings. Applying the EC 1.21.3.3 mechanism to diacylphloroglucinol formation, the
enzymatic synthesis of a methylene bridge between two PIB molecules could proceed as
shown in Figure 6.
In summary, we characterize the mono- and diacylphloroglucinols of H. gentianoides, and
describe their accumulation in different biological accessions and developmental stages. The
data is deposited in the public PMR metabolomics database (http://metnetdb.org/PMR/, Hur
et al. 2013), enabling accessibility and extension by the research community. The data lead
us to propose a network for acylphloroglucinol biosynthesis in which PIB is decorated to
yield the observed monomers, followed by condensed in various combinations, giving rise
to the observed major constituents. These data enhance our understanding of the diversity of
this medicinal species, and set the stage for characterization of the genes and enzymes
involved in acylphloroglucinol metabolism.

Figure 2.
Diacylphloroglucinols in Hypericum gentianoides. A) Each diacylphloroglucinol identified
in H. gentianoides (see Table 1) is composed of one phloroglucinol (purple) and one filicinic
acid (green); many of these diacylphloroglucinols share a common phloroglucinol or
filicinic acid. For example, Saroaspidin A, Saroaspidin B, Uliginosin A, and Uliginosin B,
all share the filicinic acid 3’,3’-dimethyl-6’-oxo-phlorisobutyrophenone (3’3’me6’oxoPIB).
B) Four PIB derivatives from H. gentianoides identified by Q-TOF. Methylation and/or
prenylation of PIB would give rise to each of these compounds. Additional methylation and/
or cyclization of the resultant compounds would give rise to four more monomers, creating a
pool of eight monomers sufficient to explain the synthesis of all nine highly accumulated
acylphloroglucinols, without any post-dimerization modifications. C) Nine
diacylphloroglucinols would be possible if diacylphloroglucinol biosynthesis occurred via a
“diacylphloroglucinol decoration” route. In black are compounds that were identified
through our Q-TOF analyses, in red are compounds that were not detected in our Q-TOF
analysis of H. gentianoides extracts. The fully undecorated dimer (diPIB), and six of the
eight partially decorated dimers that would be required if synthesis followed the
“diacylphloroglucinol decoration” route were not detected. We assume the two partially
decorated dimers present in H. gentianoides are 1) degradation products of
diacylphloroglucinol end products or 2) products resulting from dimerization of a decorated
monomer to a PIB molecule.

Figure 3.
Accumulation of acylphloroglucinols in Hypericum gentianoides varies with developmental
stage and accession. HPLC analysis was used for relative quantification of the nine major
acylphloroglucinol metabolites. Three biological replicates were used for each sample. Data
is analyzed and visualized in the interactive Plant Metabolomics Resource
(www.metnetdb.org/pmr). Complete data is shown in Table S1. Volcano plots illustrates a
comparison of two of the most diverse materials. In this plot, the Y-axis represents the p-
value (lower p-values indicate a more significant difference); the X-axis represents the fold
change (the farther from 1, the greater the fold-change). p-values are determined using a
student T-test after log (base 2) transformation. 1-1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB; 2-Uliginosin B;
3-Saroaspidin A; 4-Saroaspidin B; 5-[3’mePIB]-[1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB]; 6-
[3’3’4me6’oxoPIB]-[3’prenPIB]; 7-Uliginosin A; 8-Hyperbrasilol C; 9-
[1’3’pren45’me4’oxoPIB]-[3’prenPIB]. (a) Accumulation of 9 major acylphloroglucinols is
between 2–7.5 fold greater in young seedlings of standardized accession PI 664838
compared to Ames 27657 young seedlings. (n=3, p values range from 0.0009 to 0.05). (b)
Accumulation of 9 major acylphloroglucinols (is between 1.7–10.9 fold greater in vegetative
phase shoots than in reproductive phase shoots (preflowering) in the standardized accession
PI 664838). (n=3, p values range from 1.9×10−6 to 0.03)

Figure 4.
Q-TOF-MS/MS/MS of H. gentianoides extract to validate the identity of the predicted
monomers of Table 2. The fragmentation pattern corresponding to 3’mePIB,
3’3’me6’oxoPIB,3’prenPIB, and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB was compared to that of the
previously identified uliginosin A, saroaspidin A, and hyperbrasilol C. Identical
fragmentation patterns indicate that these masses in fact correspond to these four monomers
and not any other isomer. MS/MS spectra at the molecular weights of the putative
monomers 3’3’4me6’oxoPIB and 1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB were analyzed (Table 3). None of
the previously identified acylphloroglucinols contain either of these two monomers.
Therefore these fragmentation patterns are consistent with the presence of 3’3’4me6’oxoPIB
and 1’pren3’4me4’oxoPIB in H. gentianoides.

Figure 5.
Proposed biosynthetic pathway of acylphloroglucinols in Hypericum gentianoides as
detected by Q-TOF-MS, Q-TOF-MS/MS and LC/ESI-MS analysis. All acylphloroglucinols
involved in the biosynthesis of the nine acylphloroglucinol products are shown in this
schematic. Valine and possibly pyruvate are likely primary metabolite precursors of
acylphloroglucinols in H. perforatum (Karppinen 2010). Q-TOF and LC/ESI analysis
indicates that H. gentianoides contains PIB and PIB derivatives that are decorated by
prenylation or methylation, or are cyclized (in the case of 8ib22meC57diol). Every
acylphloroglucinol dimer in H. gentianoides can be accounted for as a dimerization product
of one of the detected phloroglucinol monomers and one of the detected filicinic acid

monomers. Thus, the complement of monomers in H. gentianoides is consistent with the
concept that monomers are first decorated and then dimerized to yield the
diacylphloroglucinols . Blue, metabolites identified for the first time in this study; rust,
identified in H. gentianoides (this study) and other Hypericum species (see Table 2).
Hyperforin (grey) accumulates in H. perforatum (Soelberg et al. 2007). PIB* and
3’prenPIB* are postulated to be a hyperforin precursor in H. perforatum (Adam et al. 2002).

Figure 6.
Proposed mechanism of methylene bridge formation in diacylphloroglucinol biosynthesis.
The formation of a diacylphloroglucinol from two monoacylphloroglucinols proceeds via a
multi-step process similar to that of reticuline oxidase (Kutchan and Dittrich 1995). First one
of the monomers would have to be methylated, that methyl group would become charged. A
nucleophilic attack of this charged methyl group by the other monomer would form the
observed methylene bridge. A third basic residue would assist in stabilizing the second
monomer completing the observed diacylphloroglucinols. R1 and R2 are chemical groups
corresponding to PIB decorations. B1, B2, and B3 are proposed basic residues of the enzyme
involved in diacylphloroglucinol formation.

bSaroaspidin B and japonicin A have the same MW and MS/MS spectra and cannot be formally distinguished by our analysis. Japonicin A is a
homodimer of two filicinic acid moieties, while saroaspidin B is a heterodimer. Because the other seven diacylphloroglucinols are heterodimers of
a phloroglucinol and filicinic acid moiety we believe saroaspidin B to be the more likely compound.

Table 3
Molecular ions and MS/MS of putative monomers and partially decorated diacylphloroglucinols from H.
gentianoides detected using Q-TOF. With the exception of 3’3’4me6’oxoPIB and 1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB, an
isobutane is fragmented from the isobutyl group on all monomers. MS/MS of 3’prenPIB and
1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB show a fragmentation on the prenyl group as well. 3’4mePIB and 8ib22meC57diol are
not shown due to low ion abundance. The partially decorated dimers (3’3’me6’oxoPIB and PIB and
1’pren3’me4’oxoPIB and PIB) are fragmented at the methylene bridge connecting them, similar to what is
observed in the full decorated dimers.
