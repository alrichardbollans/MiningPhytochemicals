Sauro, 85100 Potenza, Italy2Dipartimento di Scienze dei Sistemi Colturali, Forestali e dell’Ambiente, Università degli Studi della Basilicata, Via Dell’Ateneo Lucano,85100 Potenza, ItalyReceived 4 July 2005; Revised 1 September 2005; Accepted 1 September 2005Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) extracted from tomato leaves and berries (Lycopersicon esculentumMill.) were separated and identified using optimized reversed-phase liquid chromatography withelectrospray ionization (ESI) and ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS). The ESI source polarity andchromatographic conditions were evaluated. The ESI spectra contain valuable information, whichincludes the mass of SGAs, the mass of the aglycones, and several characteristic fragment ions.Cleavage at the interglycosidic bonds proximal to the aglycones is the most prominent processin the ESI process. A protonated molecule, [MþH]þ, accompanied by a mixed adduct ion,[MþHþNa]2þ, was observed for a-tomatine (i.e., m/z 1034.7 and 528.9) and dehydrotomatine (i.e.,m/z 1032.6 and 527.9) in positive ion mode spectra. The structures of these tomato glycoalkaloidswere confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry. The identification of a new a-tomatine isomerglycoalkaloid, named filotomatine (MW 1033), which shares a common tetrasaccharide structure(i.e., lycotretraose) with a-tomatine and dehydrotomatine, and soladulcidine as an aglycone, isdescribed for the first time. It occurs in significant amounts in the extracts of wild tomato foliage.Multistage mass spectrometry both of the protonated molecules and of the doubly charged ionswas used for detailed structural elucidation of SGAs. Key fragmentations and regularities in frag-mentation pathways are described and the fragmentation mechanisms involved are proposed.Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Many Solanaceae plants, including potatoes, tomatoes, pep-pers and eggplants, produce toxic metabolites known as ster-oidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs), which are nitrogen-containingcompounds bearing a sugar chain (three or four units) linkedto a steroidal moiety (aglycone) by the 3-hydroxyl group.1–3The major components of a comprehensive family ofSGAs are a-solanine and a-chaconine in potato plants(Solanum tuberosum), while a-tomatine and dehydrotomatineare spirosolane-type SGAs occurring in tomato plants(L. esculentum).4–6 Toxic levels of these compounds in foliageand unripe fruit can prevent plant disease due to insects andother animals. It is very useful to obtain input on the variousstructural changes of SGAs as their content is regulated byseveral biotic and abiotic stimuli.7 A complete survey of gly-coalkaloids in the worldwide cultivated L. esculentum plantsstill, however, needs to be established. To discover thedetailed functions of SGAs in berries, shoots and leaves oftomato plants, and to monitor their level during ripening oftomatoes, especially of novel breeds destined for humanconsumption, it is critical to develop a reliable, simple andsensitive method of SGA determination.Several methods have been reported for the analysis ofSGAs and their corresponding aglycones, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled withultraviolet (UV) detection8–10 or pulsed amperometricdetection (PAD),11–13 gas chromatography (GC),14,15 immu-noassays,16 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry,17 and capil-lary electrophoresis with UV detection.18 Very recently, anovel analytical method has been reported which is basedon the use of non-aqueous capillary electrophoresiscoupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry(ESI-MS).19,20 Although GC has previously been used as themain technique for the measurement of derivatized SGAs, weare developing a direct and sensitive method which shouldprovide considerable advantages over current methodolo-gies. Indeed, replacement of GC with LC allows thedetermination of thermally labile compounds withoutrecurring to hydrolysis and derivatization steps, thusreducing the analysis time, eliminating predictable sourcesof error and hazardous/expensive chemicals.Mass spectrometry is the most selective technique for therapid qualitative determination of known compounds as wellas the identification of unknown compounds from extracts ofCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.*Correspondence to: T.

Generally, ESI-MS provides a massspectrum with little or no fragmentation, and this techniqueis suitable for the characterization of not only a singlecompound, but also complex mixtures. In this study, anintegrated approach consisting of LC/ESI-MS and tandemmass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been used for the identifica-tion of SGAs in leaves and berries extracts. The application ofLC/MS to the determination of SGAs in Solanaceaeplants has,till now, been very limited.21–23 To the best of our knowledge,we report here for the first time a tomatine-like glycoalkaloidoccurring in tomato leaves based on MS/MS analysis. UsingESI-MS, it has been possible to obtain structurally significantfragmentation ions of SGAs. The structures of spirosolane-type SGAs occurring in tomato plants are shown in Fig. 1,with the corresponding molecular formula and stereochemi-cal configurations. The present approach is currently beingapplied to studies of the SGA content of crude extracts oftomato plants.EXPERIMENTALChemicalsSamples of authentic a-tomatine (99%) were supplied byFluka Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland); solanidine (98%) andtomatidine hydrochloride were purchased from SigmaChemical Co. (Steinheim, Germany); while dehydrotomatineand tomatidenol were present as impurities in a-tomatineand tomatidine standards, respectively.24 Acetic acid, formicacid, acetonitrile, HPLC-grade methanol and water wereobtained from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). All chemicals wereused as received. Stock standard solutions of glycoalkaloidsand aglycones were prepared from analytical reagent gradechemicals in methanol and were then stored at 208C. Justbefore use, standard solutions were prepared from the stocksolutions by dilution to the desired concentration with 0.1%formic acid in water and acetonitrile (65/35 v/v).Instrumentation and separation conditionsLC/ESI-MS analysis was carried out using a LCQ Classic iontrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA,USA) equipped with a Spectra System P4000 binary pumpand a solvent degasser. The column was a Supelcosil LC-ABZ, amide-C16 (5 mm, 250 4.6 mm) with a guard columnof the same material (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA)and a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water(solvent A) and methanol (solvent B). The following gradientwas applied: 30–43% B in 0–8 min; 43–60% B in 8–20 min and60% B in 20–24 min. Prior to the next injection, the columnwas equilibrated for 6 min. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min,which was split 3:1 after the analytical column to allow200mL/min to enter the ESI source.Positive ion ESI-MS was chosen for the detection andquantification of SGAs. The instrument was tuned tofacilitate the ionization process and achieve the highestsensitivity. The voltage on the ESI needle was set at 5 kV,producing a spray current of approximately 80 mA.

The sheath gas (N2) flow rateused was 60 (arbitrary units) and the auxiliary gas was set tozero (arbitrary units). Total ion current (TIC) and selected ionmonitoring (SIM) modes were used to record the abundancesof the protonated molecules of SGAs and aglycones. In thefull-scan mode, masses were scanned as centroid data fromm/z 150–1200 at a rate of 2 scan/s. The instrumental control,data acquisition and data processing were performed usingthe Xcalibur software package (version 1.1, ThermoQuest).Plant material and sample extractionFreshly harvested green and red tomatoes (Lycopersicon escu-lentumMill.) cherry cv. Camelia along with leaves of the sameplant, grown on Barile Pozzolana substrate in a greenhouse ofthe ‘Pantanello’ Agricultural Experimental Station in Meta-ponto (Basilicata, Italy), were immediately stored at 208Cto arrest maturation. Then, 500 mg of each freeze-dried sam-ple were placed in 10 mL of 1% acetic acid aqueous solution.To facilitate contact between plant tissue and extraction sol-vent, the suspension was stirred for about 2 h and then centri-fuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet obtained wassuspended in 10 mL of 1% acetic acid, shaken, centrifugedand the two extracts were combined. To remove solid parti-cles, this extract was filtered through a single-use 0.22 mmnylon filter (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and 20mL of samplewere injected into the LC/MS system. As SGAs were presentat relatively high levels in leaves and green tomatoes, anappropriate dilution with 0.1% formic acid in water and acet-onitrile (65/35 v/v) was carried out before injection.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMS and MS/MS spectra of SGAs occurring intomato plantsThe positive ion ESI mass spectrum of an infused standardsolution of a-tomatine (1, Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 2, with themajor six ions assigned. In addition to the [MþH]þ ion (m/z1034.7), relatively abundant fragment ions at m/z 578.6,528.9 and 416.5 were also detected. It is suggested that the sec-ondary amine of tomatidine is easily protonated during theionization process. Ions at m/z 578.6 and 416.5 correspondto [TomatidineþGalþH]þ and [TomatidineþH]þ which aremainly produced by eliminating the Xyl-Glc(-Glc)- moietyand the whole sugar chain (i.e., lycotetraose), respectively.The ion atm/z 528.9 (see inset of Fig. 2) is due to the formationof a doubly charged ion, [MþHþNa]2þ. Such an adduct isreadily recognized because the 13C isotope peak occurs about0.5 Th higher than the corresponding 12C peak.In order to gain more structural information, MS/MSspectra of all the major ions occurring in Fig. 2 were recorded.Figure 3(A) shows the MS/MS spectrum of the protonatedmolecule, [MþH]þ; the most prominent product ion ism/z 1016.6 [MþH–H2O]þ, formed by the loss of H2Othrough a rearrangement process in the E ring, as suggestedin Scheme 1.25 The abundance of the m/z 1016.6 ion is muchhigher than that of the ion at m/z 416.5, which demonstratesthat the [MþH]þ ion preferentially expels a H2O molecule.The same interpretation of loss of H2O can be applied to theMS/MS spectrum of the ion at m/z 578.6 (see Fig. 3(B)), whichyields an abundant product ion at m/z 560.5, i.e.,[TomatidineþGalþH–H2O]þ, and two other ions at m/z 273and 255. MS/MS of the m/z 528.9 ion yields an abundantproduct ion at m/z 520.0, through loss of H2O, [MþHþNa–H2O]2þ (Fig. 3(C)). In the same figure the reappearance canalso be seen of the higher mass ionsm/z 1034.5 and 1016.6, theprotonated molecule and the ion formed after the loss of amolecule of H2O, [MþH–H2O]þ, respectively. Figures 3(A)and 3(C) display successive losses of xylose (132 Da) and axylose-glucose unit (132þ 162 Da), yielding less abundantions at m/z 902 and 740, respectively, which were of greatimportance for the determination of the sugar sequence ofsteroidal glycoalkaloids. A comprehensive rationalizationof these processes is reported in Scheme 2. In additionto the product ion at m/z 398.6 corresponding to[TomatidineþH]þ–18 (Fig. 3(D)), the ion at m/z 416.5, i.e.,[TomatidineþH]þ, yields two other main ions at m/z 273 and255, involving cleavage of the E-ring. Such a fragmentationmechanism, which is similar to that of other steroidalsaponins, is illustrated in Scheme 3.26 It demonstrates thatlosses of H2O are common to all ions containing the skeletonof spirosolane-type aglycones. Cleavage at the C–N bond ofthe spirosolane carbon is in agreement with the formationof the ions at m/z 273 and 255. These findings provideevidence that the dehydration occurs at a site other than theE-ring. Interestingly, all of the ions detected in this studycould be structurally assigned.Figure 2.

Inset shows the mixed adduct ion,[MþHþNa]2þ, which exhibits a halving in spacing comparedwith the protonated molecule [MþH]þ at m/z 1034.7. Thecharge status and m/z values of ions were checked inseparate experiments using higher resolution scanning‘zoom scan’. Instrumental response was normalized to100% but the absolute value in arbitrary units is provided inthe heading of spectra.Analysis of tomato glycoalkaloids by LC/ESI-MS 3105Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 3103–3110The second major glycoalkaloid found in tomato extractsis known as dehydrotomatine (3) with tomatidenol (4) asits aglycone (Fig. 1). Note that a standard compound ofdehydrotomatine is not commercially available, but it ispresent as an impurity of a-tomatine. Thus the spectraillustrated here were acquired using the same standardsolution prepared for a-tomatine. As can be seen from thespectrum in Fig. 4 the protonated molecule [MþH]þ is at m/z1032.5. Ions corresponding to [TomatidenolþGalþH]þ at m/z576.5 and [MþHþNa]2þ at m/z 527.9 were also observed (seeinset of Fig. 4). Unfortunately, the minor ion at lower massvalues, i.e., [TomatidenolþH]þ at m/z 414.5, is not clearlydistinguishable in the presence of a relatively large back-ground noise. Here also, however, the MS/MS spectra werefound to be very useful for structural elucidation. Figure 5(A)shows the MS/MS spectrum of the protonated molecule; themost prominent product ion is at m/z 1014.5, [MþH–H2O]þ,followed by the [AglyconeþH]þ ion at m/z 414.5 along withan ion at m/z 900.6. This latter loss of 1032 900¼ 132 Dacorresponds to cleavage of a xylosil unit, as expected from thelycotetraose unit. The same issues discussed above for a-tomatine apply here for the ions at m/z 576.6 and 527.9 (seeFigs. 5(B) and 5(C)). In addition to some product ionscorresponding to fragments, MS/MS of m/z 527.9 yields theprotonated molecule at m/z 1032.4.Based on these findings, the mixed adduct ion of a-tomatine and dehydrotomatine, [MþHþNa]2þ, probablyresults from the sodiation of the tetrasaccharide moiety andthe protonation of the nitrogen atom of the spirosolane ring,as suggested in Scheme 3. This may be considered as furtherconfirmation that both a-tomatine and dehydrotomatinehave the same carbohydrate side chain, i.e., the lycotretraosemoiety.27–30 The [TomatidenolþH]þ ion (m/z 414.5), pro-duced by loss of the whole sugar chain from [MþH]þ,predominantly experiences cleavage of the E-ring, thusyielding two ions at m/z 271.2 and 253.2. These results showthe difference of one unsaturation between tomatidenol andtomatidine, the former containing a double bond at position5,6 in the steroidal skeleton (i.e., D5). This set of observationsclearly indicates that the structures of spirosolane-type SGAaglycones 2 and 4 are almost similar. The same ESI-MSfeatures discussed above for a standard solution of a-tomatine and dehydrotomatine were also observed in theScheme 1. Rationalization of the common dehydration process of the a-tomatine fragments and tomatidine aglycone. Each of these ions shows aproduct ion mass spectra characterized by elimination of H2O from the [MþH]þ.aLow abundance ions.Figure 3.

Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 3103–3110mass spectra obtained from crude extracts of tomato leavesand berries (not shown).In order to gain more structural information on theaglycone moieties of alkaloid steroids, accurate MS andMS/MS spectra were acquired of solanidine (397 Da) andtomatidine (415 Da) under the same experimental conditionsas were used for the tomato glycoalkaloids, as illustrated inFigs. 6 and 7, respectively. Note that solanidine is theaglycone of a-solanine, which is typically found in potatoextracts; it was chosen to show the very different fragmenta-tion patterns in multistage MS experiments compared withthose of tomatidine and tomatidenol. Whereas a definiteproduct ion at m/z 383.5 was observed in the MS/MSspectrum of solanidine, probably derived from the proto-nated molecule at m/z 398.5 after a methyl radical loss(Fig. 6(B)), the MS/MS spectrum of tomatidine at m/z 416.5exhibits a product ion at m/z 398.6, which is probablycharacteristic of E-ring scission with the positive chargelocalized on the D-ring (see Scheme 3). The same spectrumalso revealed a specific loss of 143 Da yielding the productions atm/z 273.1 and 255.1 from the precursor ions atm/z 416.5and 398.6, respectively. In agreement with very recently dataobtained in our laboratory, the fragmentation pattern ofsolanidine does not exhibit the loss of a H2O molecule.31,32 Itshould also be mentioned that the potato glycoalkaloids a-solanine and a-chaconine, under the present experimentalconditions, exhibited very low abundances of mixed adductions (not shown). As a result, the occurrence of doublycharged [MþNaþH]2þ ions appears to be very helpful forpeak confirmation and the structural elucidation of tomatoglycoalkaloids (vide infra).LC/ESI-MS of tomato plant extractsFriedman and co-workers have shown that the separation oftomato extracts can be achieved in reversed-phase liquidScheme 2.

Along with the prominent peak 2 of a-tomatine, thedehydrotomatine (peak 1), small amounts of tomatidine(peak 3) and a relatively intense peak at 16.0 min (U1)were observed. The relative intensities of peaks 1, 2 and U1found in the foliage extracts were approximately 0.08, 1.00and 0.07, respectively. A mass spectrum of the unknowncompound U1 was acquired and its structure investigated.As can be seen from the spectrum in Fig. 9(A), the [MþH]þion is at m/z 1034.5, which means that the nominal mass ofthe unknown U1 is 1033 Da. The minor ion at m/z 1056.4 isindicative of sodium adduction to give [Mþ23]þ. Moreover,the spectrum of compound U1 contains two fragment ionsat m/z 528.9 and 578.8, which exhibit the same frag-mentation behavior as a-tomatine, i.e., m/z 578.8¼[TomatidineþGalþH]þ, m/z 528.9¼ [MþHþNa]2þ and m/z416.5¼ [TomatidineþH]þ, suggesting a tomatine-like struc-ture. Figure 10 shows results from the MS/MS experimentson the ions at m/z 578.8, 528.9, and 416.5, which producedbase peaks at m/z 560, 520, and 398, respectively, after theloss of a molecule of H2O. The other product ions of m/z528.9 at m/z 1016.6 and 740.4 are due to the neutral losses of18 (H2O) and 294. This last neutral loss is indicative of the pre-sence in the molecule of a pentose-hexose unit (132þ 162). Ithas been reported that SGAs with branched sugar chains losethe terminal sugar moiety primarily.31,32 Confirmation of thetetrasaccharide side chain incorporated within the parentglycoalkaloid U1 was obtained upon acid hydrolysis in 1 NHCl at 1008C for 2 h and subsequent separation by anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detec-tion.33 The presence of galactose, glucose and xylose in theapproximate molar ratios 1:2:1 was ascertained (not shown),which are the same ratios as those occurring in the oligosac-charide moiety of a-tomatine, within the experimental errorof this analytical methodology.The [AglyconeþH]þ ion (m/z 416.5), produced by loss ofthe whole sugar chain, undergoes cleavage of the E-ring toyield ions at m/z 271.1 and 253.3. It is probable that thisaglycone is soladulcidine (see Fig. 1) which is closely relatedto tomatidine; they form a pair of isomers that have oppositeconfigurations at C-22 and C-25 in the nitrogen-containing F-ring, which means that the C–N bond of the spirosolanecarbon is in the a-configuration. The corresponding spiroso-lane aglycone containing a double bond at position 5,6 in thesteroidal skeleton (i.e., D5) is known as solasodine (7).15,34,35We could not elucidate the structure of the soladulcidineaglycone moiety based on MS/MS data. However, it isinteresting to note that the m/z values of all the fragmentions of U1 and a-tomatine are identical, and slight diff-erences with respect to relative product ion abundances inthe MS/MS spectrum in the unknown U1 and in thereference MS/MS spectrum for a-tomatine can beexplained as due to the relative quantitative level of thesecompounds. The similarities concerns also the doublepositively charged ion, [MþHþNa]2þ at m/z 529.7. Workis underway to verify the formation of these mixed adductions within the family of SGAs in Solanaceae plants in termsof sugar units, classes of monosaccharides and alkalimetal ions.Figure 9.

Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 3103–3110From the analysis of the mass-measured ions discussedabove, the following preliminary conclusion can be reached:the unknown U1 contains at least one N atom, its molecularweight is the same of that of tomatine with an equivalentfragmentation pattern and a strictly related tetrasaccharidemoiety. By adding the condition of a different retention timein RP-LC, the only possibility is that this compound is anisomer of a-tomatine which has never previously beendescribed. Probably the unknown U1 in the extracts oftomato leaves is composed of soladulcidine as an aglyconeand lycotetreaose as the sugar linked to the hydroxyl group(see Fig. 1). This tomatine-like glycoalkaloid, which exhibitsan inverse stereochemical configuration of the 22-carbonatom, is named filotomatine. Interestingly, the fragmenta-tions of filotomatine can be rationalized based on the samemechanism illustrated in Schemes 1–3 for a-tomatine and itsaglycone 2. Unfortunately, these compounds did not givesignificant differences in product ion types, even in theirsequential MS3 and MS4 spectra. Other spectroscopictechniques such as 1H and 13C NMR would be able todistinguish between the two SGAs. Considering, however,that a-tomatine and filotomatine are regioisomers, theirchromatographic separation is satisfactory as their differencein retention time is about 1 min. We have systematicallyinvestigated the occurrence of this new glycoalkaloid inextracts of tomato leaves. Extracts of berries were alsoconsidered, but no peaks were observed at the retention timeof U1, which is in agreement with previously reported datathat the only major SGAs of tomatoes are a-tomatine anddehydrotomatine.5 It would be interesting to know to whatextent this glycoalkaloid is involved in host-plant resistanceagainst phytopathogens.CONCLUSIONSUsing LC/ESI-MS and MS/MS we have demonstrated theoccurrence of a previously unidentified steroidal glycoalk-aloid of tomato leaves which shares the same core aglyconestructure as a-tomatine and dehydrotomatine, but wherethe differences from them appear to be confined to the F-ring of the steroidal moiety. For analysis of SGAs in crudeextracts, we recommend initial application of positive ionESI-MS to obtain the molecular mass information for thecomponents via the [MþH]þ ions, and to determine thesugar moiety at the C-3 position by acquiring MS/MS spec-tra. The observed clusters, which are mixed adduct ions ofSGAs, [MþHþNa]2þ, were found very useful for peak con-firmation. Although this method was developed specifi-cally for tomato plants, it can be applied to evaluate theSGA composition of other vegetables, such as potatoesand sweet peppers. Construction of a library containingMS/MS spectra for known SGAs would greatly facilitatethe identification of these compounds in real samples andwould permit even more complete fingerprinting of SGAsarising from species differences between Solanaceae plantextracts.AcknowledgementThis work is part of the PhD. thesis of F.L.
