Despite its appreciated organoleptic 27 properties, the aromatic profile of the fresh vegetable remains to be studied. In the 28 present study, volatile compounds from five wild populations were extracted by the 29 headspace-solid phase microextraction technique, analysed by gas cromatography-mass 30 spectrometry, and compared to related crops. The wild species had a high number of 31 aromatic compounds. It was rich in monoterpenes (49.2%), sesquiterpenes (39.4%) and 32 phenylpropanoids (9.6%), with quantitative differences among populations, in absolute 33 terms and relative abundance. On average, germacrene D was the main compound 34 (16.6%), followed by allo-ocimene (11.9%) and limonene (11.1%). Only in one 35 population, the levels of limonene were greater than those of germacrene D. Among 36 phenylpropanoids, dillapiol displayed the highest levels, and co-occurred with 37 myristicin in all populations except one. These differences may have a genetic 38 component, which would indicate the possibility of establishing selection programmes 39 for the development of water celery as a crop adapted to different market preferences. 40 On the other hand, comparison with related crops revealed some similarities among 41 individual volatiles present in the different crops, which would be responsible of the 42 common aroma notes. However, water celery displayed a unique profile, which was in 43 addition quantitatively richer than others. Thus, this differentiation may promote the use 44 of water celery as a new crop. 45 Keywords: Aroma; carrot; celery; diversity; fool's watercress; parsley; 46 phenylpropanoids; sesquiterpenes47 Versión autor 3  1. Introduction 48 Aromatic plants, rich in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been highly 49 appreciated by humans since the early beginning of civilization (Evergetis & 50 Haroutounian, 2014). These plants are used in the cuisine to enhance the taste of many 51 dishes, either as fresh herbs or dried spices. There are different botanical families 52 including species rich in VOCs such as Alliaceae, Apiaceae, Labiateae, Lauraceae, 53 Myrtaceae or Rutaceae (Raut & Karuppayil, 2014). Among these, Apiaceae and 54 Labiateae families are probably the most relevant for culinary uses as flavour 55 enhancers. Within the Apiaceae family it is possible to find species used in cuisine by 56 the aerial parts such as celery (Apium graveolens L. var. dulce (Mill.) Pers.), coriander 57 (Coriandrum sativum L.), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare 58 Mill.) or parsley (Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) Nyman), or for the seeds such as anise 59 (Pimpinella anisum L.) or cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.). Due to the importance of the 60 family, it is possible to find several works studying the volatile profiles, specially 61 focused on essential oils (e.g., Cioanca, Hancianu, Mircea, Trifan & Hritcu, 2016; El-62 Zaeddi et al., 2016; Filly et al., 2014). In addition, the interest on the volatile fraction 63 and/or essential oils from other wild species and neglected vegetables has increased 64 recently, attending mainly to pharmacological uses and, to a lesser extent, culinary 65 purposes (e.g., Dev et al., 2010; Landoulsi et al., 2016; Maggi, Bartolucci & Conti, 66 2017; Quassinti et al., 2013; Tabanca et al., 2007). 67 Water celery (Apium nodiflorum (L.) Lag., also known as fool's watercress) is a 68 perennial wild herb from the Apiaceae family. It is distributed in Central and Southern 69 Europe (especially in the South-West), Northern Africa and Western and Central Asia 70 (Knees, 2003; Molina, Pardo-de-Santayana, & Tardío, 2016), and can be easily found in 71 fresh, shallow water courses such as natural streams or irrigation ditches. The young 72 Versión autor 4  leaves and tender shoots have been consumed in the Mediterranean cultures in salads 73 and different traditional dishes (Guarrera & Savo, 2016; Licata et al., 2016; Tardío et 74 al., 2016). In the last years wild water celery is marketed in the United Kingdom in 75 mixtures of wild vegetables due to its flavour and crunchy texture (Evans & Irving, 76 2018), and its use may increase if the species becomes cultivated. 77 The taste of water celery has been described as spicy (Guarrera & Savo, 2016) with a 78 flavour that resembles celery, carrot (Daucus carota L.) or a mixture of both of them 79 (Heshmati Afshar, Maggi, Iannarelli, Cianfaglione, & Isman, 2017; Nebel, Pieroni, & 80 Heinrich, 2006; “Wild Food UK,” 2018). In addition, the volatile fraction has been 81 previously studied in essential oils extracted from dried materials (Benelli, Pavela, 82 Ricciutelli, Lupidi, & Maggi, 2017; Heshmati Afshar et al., 2017; Maxia et al., 2012; 83 Menghini, Leporini, Tirillini, Epifano, & Genovese, 2010). Nevertheless, dried samples 84 do not represent the common way to consume this vegetable. In addition, the extraction 85 of VOCs by hydrodistillation, the common methodology applied for essential oils, has 86 as a disadvantage the occurrence of thermal artifacts, which may modify the real 87 volatile profile, as well as tedious and time-consuming extraction protocols (Rodríguez-88 Burruezo, Kollmannsberger, González-Mas, Nitz, & Nuez, 2010). As an alternative, the 89 headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique has been successfully 90 used for the isolation of VOCs in a number of fruits and vegetables (e.g., González-91 Mas, Rambla, Alamar, Gutiérrez & Granell, 2011; López-Gresa et al., 2017; Mzoughi et 92 al., 2018; Taveira et al., 2009), providing a more accurate profile of volatiles present in 93 fresh vegetables. In the present work, we evaluated the volatile profile of water celery 94 based on the analysis of the fresh edible leaves and tender shoots. Considering that the 95 most common use of water celery is as vegetable eaten raw in salads, HS-SPME 96 technique will provide a more realistic and accurate description of its aroma and flavour 97 Versión autor 5  factors, as they are perceived by the consumer. We also compared the volatile profile of 98 water celery with related cultivated species (i.e., carrot, celery and parsley) in order to 99 identify qualitative and quantitative differences and similarities, which will be helpful to 100 explain the distinctive features of the aroma and flavour of this species. 101  102 2. Materials and methods 103 2.1. Plant material 104 Irrigation ditches with regular water flows of the Horta Nord shire of Valencia (Spain) 105 were prospected for water celery populations during the spring of 2015 (Fig. 1). Five 106 isolated populations were sampled: Nod-001 (Puerto de Sagunto, 39º37'30'' N, 0º16'49'' 107 W), Nod-015 (Foios, 39º31'59'' N, 0º20'31'' W), Nod-018 (Meliana, 39º31'01'' N, 108 0º19'36'' W), Nod-023 (Pueblo Nuevo, 39º31'19'' N, 0º23'17'' W) and Nod-025 (Alfara 109 del Patriarca, 39º32'21'' N, 0º23'06'' W). The edible shoots were harvested, cleaned and 110 stored at 4 ºC until analysed within the next two days (Fig. 1). 111 In addition, two commercial samples of aerial parts of celery and parsley, and one 112 commercial sample of carrot (including both root and aerial parts) were acquired from 113 local markets and used as reference crops. The samples were also analysed within the 114 next 24 hours after acquisition. For all the materials, three independent replicates were 115 prepared. 116 2.2. Preparation of samples and extraction of VOCs 117 Extraction and analysis of volatiles was performed by the HS-SPME technique 118 according to Moreno, Fita, González-Mas and Rodríguez-Burruezo (2012). For that, 1.5 119 g of fresh leaves were weighted, finely chopped with a knife and immediately placed 120 into 20 mL sealed headspace vials. In the case of carrot roots, 1.5 g were weighted and 121 cut in small, regular pieces, then placed into the sealed vials. Pre-incubation of samples 122 Versión autor 6  was performed at 40ºC during 30 min, then in the extraction step, VOCs were adsorbed 123 on a fibre (50/30 µm DVB/CAR/PDMS; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 40 min at 124 the same temperature. The thermal desorption was carried out at 250ºC for 30 s in the 125 splitless mode. Prior to the first analysis, the fibre was conditioned at 270ºC for 1 h and 126 reconditioned after each sample for 30 min at 250ºC to ensure no cross-contamination 127 between samples.  128 2.3. Analysis of volatiles 129 VOCs were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a 130 6890N Network GC System with autosampler coupled to a 5973 Inert Mass Selective 131 Detector (Agilent Techonologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a HP-5MS 132 J&W silica capillary column (5% phenyl-95% methylpolysiloxane as stationary phase, 133 30 m length x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm thickness film; Agilent Technologies). Helium was 134 used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL min-1. The temperature of the column was 135 programmed to raise from 100ºC to 250ºC at a rate of 5ºC min-1 and then maintained at 136 250ºC for 10 minutes. The transfer line was maintained at 220ºC. The electron impact 137 (EI) mode (70 eV ionization energy, source temperature 225ºC) was used for the 138 detection by the mass spectrometer, and acquisition was performed in scanning mode 139 (mass range m/z 35-350 amu). 140 Chromatograms and spectra were processed using the MSD ChemStation D.02.00.275 141 (Agilent Technologies). Identification of compounds was performed by comparing the 142 GC retention time and mass spectra with reference substances (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint 143 Louis, MO, USA), when available, or tentatively by comparing the mass spectra with 144 the NIST 2005 Mass Spectral Library, previous literature and also with a customized 145 library from our laboratory and, when available. Due to the number of volatiles 146 detected, it was not possible to find suitable standards and estimate response factors. 147 Versión autor 7  Thus, quantification of VOCs was based on the integration of peak areas by the total ion 148 current chromatogram (TIC), as previously reported (e.g., González-Mas et al., 2011; 149 Moreno et al., 2012; Rodríguez-Burruezo et al., 2010). The percentage of each 150 compound was also estimated as the ratio of its peak area relative to the total of 151 compounds identified. 152 2.4. Statistical analysis 153 The five populations of water celery data were used for determining the mean value of 154 the species, and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated. Data were log2-155 transformed for normalization. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and 156 significant differences were calculated with the multiple range Student-Newman-Keuls 157 test. In addition, the relative abundance of each compound in the different samples was 158 calculated as the ratio between the peak area of the compound against the total area of 159 the compounds identified in the sample. 160 Finally, an illustrative comparison of the profiles in the different species was performed 161 by means of both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster 162 Analysis, using the ClustVis Tool (Metsalu & Vilo, 2015). Unit variance scaling for the 163 normalized and centred data was applied for PCA. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis 164 was performed with the distance measures based on Pearson correlations. 165  166 3. Results 167 3.1. VOCs detected among the different species analysed 168 A total of 64 VOCs were identified among the different species (Table 1). Terpenes 169 represented the largest group in all the materials studied (41 compounds, 16 170 monoterpenes and 25 sesquiterpenes). In addition, terpenoid-derived compounds were 171 also found, including several alcohols (two monoterpene-derived, four sesquiterpene-172 Versión autor 8  derived and one diterpene-derived), three monoterpene-derived esters, one 173 monoterpene-derived ketone and one sesquiterpene-derived ether. Phenylpropanoids, 174 including myristicin and the derivatives apiol and dillapiol were also detected. Finally, 175 other compounds detected included two aromatic hydrocarbons, two ketones, one ester, 176 one cyclic alkene, two furanes and one thiazole. 177 The occurrence of the identified compounds differed among species. At a qualitative 178 level, water celery and parsley presented the most diverse volatile fraction, with forty-179 four compounds identified in each species. On the contrary, celery showed the least 180 diverse volatile composition with only thirty-one VOCs, while carrot (both roots and 181 leaves) showed an intermediate level with thirty-seven VOCs (Table 1). 182 3.2. Volatile profile of water celery 183 The volatile profile of water celery was mainly characterized by terpene hydrocarbons. 184 The average relative abundance of monoterpenes ranged between 39.1 (Nod-025) and 185 61.3% (Nod-001); however, the highest absolute levels were determined for Nod-018 186 (Table 2). On the contrary, Nod-025 presented the highest level in sesquiterpenes, more 187 than 2-fold the levels of Nod-001. In relative terms, these contents corresponded to 53.9 188 and 25.8%, respectively. 189  The main terpenes targeted in the species were germacrene D (S17, 16.6% on average), 190 allo-ocimene (M16, 11.9%), limonene (M9, 11.1%), β-(Z)-ocimene (M11, 9.7%), and 191 terpinolene (M14, 7.3%) (Table 3). However, significant differences in quantitative 192 terms and relative abundance were found among populations (Table 2). Nod-025 193 displayed the highest levels of germacrene D, 2.3-fold higher than Nod-001, and 194 represented 22.5% of the total VOCs within this population. On the contrary, Nod-001 195 displayed the greatest area of limonene (M9), corresponding to a relative abundance of 196 18.0%. Terpinolene (M14) was also relevant in Nod-018, with a content up to 5-fold 197 Versión autor 9  higher than the other populations; while β-caryophyllene (S10) was accumulated in 198 high, similar content in Nod-015 and Nod-025. By contrast, allo-ocimene (M16) and β-199 (Z)-ocimene (M11) had similar levels in the five populations. 200 Phenylpropanoids were also relevant in the species, with a relative abundance between 201 5.2% (Nod-025) and 15.0% (Nod-018) (Table 2). Dillapiol was the main 202 phenylpropanoid in all populations except Nod-001, with levels of expression similar to 203 relevant terpenes. Only in Nod-001, myristicin (P1) was found in higher relative 204 abundance than dillapiol (P2), representing the former 8.4% of total. Interestingly, Nod-205 025 did not accumulated myristicin (P1).   206 3.3. Comparison of the volatile profile of water celery with related crops 207 Water celery was determined as the species with the highest values of total VOCs, 208 followed by parsley, while celery and the carrot samples presented low contents (Table 209 3). As in water celery, terpenoids were also the main group in all related species, with 210 monoterpenes relative abundances between 49.8% and 75.3% (carrot leaves and 211 parsley, respectively). Sesquiterpenes represented also the second major class in celery 212 and carrot materials, although the total absolute levels were significantly lower 213 compared to water celery. By contrast, the relative abundance of phenylpropanoids in 214 parsley was greater than the sesquiterpenes fraction (16.2% and 7.3% on average, 215 respectively) (Table 3). 216 In parsley, the main monoterpenes were 1,3,8-p-menthatriene (M15, 24.0% on average), 217 β-phellandrene (M10, 15.1%) and terpinolene (M14, 13.6%) (Table 3). As 218 phenylpropanoids, the species presented myristicin (P1) and apiol (P3) at relative 219 abundances of 7.6 and 9.0%, respectively. Celery also had great amounts of terpenes, 220 specially limonene (M9, 31.0%), and β-caryophyllene (S10, 23.6%) (Table 3). β-221 Selinene (S18) was the third in abundance (12.0%). Phenylpropanoids were not found 222 Versión autor 10  in celery, and other compounds such as terpenoid derived compounds were present in 223 low amounts, representing only 1.8 % of the VOCs profile of this species. On the other 224 hand, the leaves and roots of carrot, even belonging to the same species, had important 225 differences (Table 3). The most abundant VOC in leaves was β-myrcene (M5), 226 representing 26.3% of its aroma. Other terpenes of relevance were germacrene D (S17, 227 13.2%), β-caryphyllene (S10, 9.7%) and α-pinene (M2, 9.0%). By contrast, terpinolene 228 was the main terpene of carrot roots (M14, 31.0%), followed by β-caryophyllene and α-229 pinene (23.7 and 6.9%, respectively). Myristicin was the unique phenylpropanoid found 230 in the species, and accounted for 11.4% of total in carrot root but was only present as 231 traces in carrot leaf (Table 3). 232 The hierarchical cluster analysis showed the differences and similarities among species 233 in an illustrative way. The analysis separated two main clusters: A and B, including 234 different subclusters (Fig. 2). Subcluster A1 grouped the sesquiterpenes found in water 235 celery, which were at the highest contents compared to the related crops. Germacrene D 236 (S17), main compound of water celery, was found in this subcluster. Levels of this VOC 237 were on average 4-fold higher than in carrot leaves, although representing similar 238 relative abundances, and even higher compared to the other materials (Table 3). In this 239 subcluster was also included the phenylpropanoid myristicin (P1), determined at similar 240 levels in water celery, parsley and carrot roots but accounting for different relative 241 abundances (Table 3). Within the subcluster A2, A2.1 included the most relevant 242 monoterpenes in water celery: limonene (M9), found at similar content in celery but 243 representing in the latter a higher relative abundance, and allo-ocimene (M16), present 244 in all materials but displaying the highest content in water celery (Fig. 2, Table 3). 245 Subcluster A2.2 grouped the isomers α-caryophyllene (S14) and β-caryophyllene (S10) 246 and the derived caryophyllene oxide (SE1) (Fig. 2), whose content varied among 247 Versión autor 11  samples. In particular, β-caryophyllene (S10) had similar levels to carrot leaves and 248 celery although the relative abundance in water celery was lower (Table 3). Finally, 249 subcluster A2.3, which clearly separated the volatile profile of water celery from the 250 rest of species, included among others, the compounds reported as unique for water 251 celery (1,2-benzothiazole, T1; spathulenol, A4; dillapiol, P2; 4-hydroxy-3-methyl 252 acetophenone, K3; and α-gurjunene, S8) (Fig. 2). 253 Subclusters in cluster B grouped compounds of relevance for the other species (Fig. 2). 254 Most compounds grouped in subcluster B1 were exclusive of celery, such as β-selinene 255 (S18), one of the main VOCs of celery, and α-selinene (S20); or found in the species at 256 the highest content, like α-cedrene (S9), also present in parsley but at significant lower 257 levels (Table 3). On the contrary, subcluster B2.1 grouped some of the main compounds 258 of parsley (Fig. 2). In this subcluster was included the compound 1,3,8-p-menthatriene 259 (M15), on average 280-fold higher than in water celery; but also those exclusive for the 260 species including β-phellandrene (M10), with similar levels to limonene (M9) in water 261 celery,  and apiol (P3), close to the levels of dillapiol (P2) in water celery (Table 3). 262 Finally, subcluster B2.2 grouped compounds unique from carrot (e.g. β-263 sesquiphellandrene, S12; and (Z)-β-farnesene) together with others found also in parsley 264 at considerable levels like α-pinene (M2), which level in these species was higher than 265 in water celery.  266 The PCA score plot clearly separated the materials evaluated according to the 267 qualitative and quantitative differences described among them (Fig. 3). The first two 268 principal components accounted for 63.0% of the variance (PC1 37.8%, PC2 25.2%), 269 which increased to 79.5% when the third principal component was considered. Water 270 celery and celery were clearly separated in the PC1, while the samples of parsley and 271 leaves of carrot overlapped. By contrast, the second principal component grouped the 272 Versión autor 12  materials by species, overlapping the roots and aerial parts of carrot and with water 273 celery and celery being very close to each other. Finally, the third principal component 274 separated the roots of carrot from the other leafy materials (Fig. 3). 275  276 4. Discussion 277 Water celery has been traditionally gathered from the wild and included in the culinary 278 tradition of several countries, especially among the Mediterranean cultures, that lived in 279 close connection with the nature. Despite the popularity of this wild vegetable, 280 described as an aromatic herb with spicy, intense flavour (Guarrera & Savo, 2013, 281 2016), there are few works focused on the aromatic profile of the species, based in the 282 analysis of the extracted essential oil from dried leaves and with pharmacological and 283 environmental purposes (Benelli et al., 2017; Heshmati Afshar et al., 2017; Maxia et al., 284 2012; Menghini et al., 2010). Here we provide for the first time the volatile profile of 285 the unprocessed water celery shoots using the HS-SPME technique instead of other 286 extracting methods.  287 Previous works reported this species as rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (20.9 to 288 58.7%) and phenylpropanoids (33.9 to 70.8%) (Benelli et al., 2017; Heshmati Afshar et 289 al., 2017; Maxia et al., 2012; Menghini et al., 2010), while the sesquiterpene fraction 290 represented less than 7.0% of total volatiles. By contrast, in our study, sesquiterpenes 291 ranged from 25.7 to 53.9%. These differences probably derived from the extraction 292 method and analysis employed. In this way, Stashenko, Jaramillo and Martínez (2004) 293 found that the HS-SPME technique significantly increased the percentage of total 294 sesquiterpenes, in comparison to other techniques. On the other hand, drying methods 295 may also affect the extraction of VOCs, although differences in these terms are not clear 296 and apparently depend on the spice, drying method and compound considered (Díaz-297 Versión autor 13  Maroto, Pérez-Coello & Cabezudo, 2002; Pirbalouti, Mahdad & Craker, 2013). 298 Consequently, monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids, specially limonene, dillapiol and 299 myristicin were previously described as the main VOCs (Benelli et al., 2017; Heshmati 300 Afshar et al., 2017; Maxia et al., 2012; Menghini et al., 2010). By contrast, the HS-301 SPME technique allowed in our work to identify the sesquiterpene germacrene D as the 302 main VOC in fresh leaves of water celery, while the relative abundance of 303 phenylpropanoids were not higher than 15% in any of the populations. 304 Our results showed that the volatile profile of water celery is quantitative and 305 qualitatively very rich, at the same or even higher level than parsley. The main aroma 306 constituents of water celery were germacrene D (S17), which provides weak spicy and 307 fruity flavour, and limonene (M9), with citrus and fresh notes (Acree and Arn, 2004; 308 Jirovetz, Buchbauer, Ngassoum & Geissler, 2002; "The Good Scents Company", 2018); 309 as well as allo-ocimene (M16), terpinolene (M14), and β-caryophyllene (S10), which 310 provide different woody, spicy and sweet notes (Acree and Arn, 2004; Jirovetz et al., 311 2002; "The Good Scents Company", 2018). Also, the great content in dillapiol (P2) 312 contributed to the spicy and woody notes that can be detected in this vegetable. 313 Moreover, the specific aroma of a species is due not only to the main components, but 314 also the relative abundance of them (Auda, Pineau, Mestdagh, Poisson, & Rytz, 2016). 315 The aroma of water celery has been described as a mixture of carrot and celery 316 (Heshmati Afshar et al., 2017), with notes that related it to parsley. The aromatic profile 317 described here reinforces this idea. On the one hand, all of them were rich in terpenes. 318 This family of VOCs has been described as the main group in the essential oil in 319 Apiaceae species, together with the phenylpropanoids (e.g., El-Zaeddi et al., 2016; 320 Jawdat, Al-Faoury, Odeh & Al-Safadi, 2015; Valente et al., 2013). Many sesquiterpenes 321 determined here provide herbal and woody notes (Acree and Arn, 2004; Jirovetz et al., 322 Versión autor 14  2002; "The Good Scents Company", 2018), whose presence would characterise the 323 common, basal aroma in all the materials. Moreover, some of the most prominent VOCs 324 of water celery were present in a similar relative abundance in celery, carrot and, to a 325 lesser extent, in parsley. For instance, limonene (M9), β-caryophyllene (S10), allo-326 ocimene (M16), β-(Z)-ocimene (M11) and terpinolene (M14) were the predominant 327 compounds of celery and were in high relative abundances also in water celery. All 328 these VOCs are probably the reason for similarities in the aroma of both vegetables. The 329 same happened with the presence of β-caryophyllene (S10) and terpinolene (M14) in 330 carrot samples. And probably the notes of parsley come from the phenylpropanoid 331 myriscitin (P1) present in parsley and water celery. On the contrary, the presence of 332 other unique compounds, such as dillapiol (P2) or spathulenol (A4), and the specific 333 combinations of VOCs present, would contribute further to differentiate the aroma of 334 water celery. 335 Also, our findings showed that the volatile fraction of water celery was quantitatively 336 richer compared to the related species evaluated, particularly in the levels of 337 sesquiterpenes. An increasing content in these compounds would be reflected in a more 338 intense aroma. In fact, the aroma and taste of wild edible vegetables is frequently cited 339 as one of the sociocultural reasons behind the consumption of these plants (Serrasolses 340 et al., 2016); and, in the case of water celery, this is a critical point for its consumption 341 since the vegetable is described as an aromatic ingredient and, therefore, is used for 342 adding flavour to several dishes (Guarrera and Savo, 2013, 2016).  343 Finally, differences among the five water celery populations were described, in terms of 344 absolute GC areas and for relative abundance of individual compounds. The genotype 345 can be responsible in the production and accumulation of volatile compounds (Darriet, 346 Andreani, De Cian, Costa, & Muselli, 2014). Thus, our results may be used in future 347 Versión autor 15  works of selection and adaptation for developing a new crop adapted to the consumers' 348 preferences. For instance, Nod-001 presented the lowest levels in sesquiterpenes, so the 349 intensity of the woody and herbal odour that many of these compounds provide, would 350 be the lowest. On the contrary, this population may be selected for developing a variety 351 with more intense citrus and minty notes, due to the higher content and relative 352 abundance in limonene (M9) of this accession. By contrast, Nod-025 could be selected 353 for the high content combined with relative abundance in germacrene D (S17) and β-354 caryophyllene (S10), two main sesquiterpenes that would provide woody and spicy 355 notes with high intensity due to their content. Moreover, based on the variation found in 356 our materials and considering that only populations of the Horta Nord shire of Valencia 357 were studied, our results suggest that more diversity on the volatile composition for this 358 species could be found in other areas. This suggestion is supported by the differences 359 that Maxia et al. (2012) found between specimens coming from Italy or Portugal. 360 Therefore, further surveys are advisable in order to widen the genetic pool available for 361 breeding based on the organoleptic quality of this species. In addition, the use of 362 controlled conditions for growing materials in the subsequent steps of the breeding 363 program would be useful for minimising the environmental effect. 364  365 5. Conclusion 366 As a whole, the volatile profile of water celery was determined as rich in terpenes, but 367 also the phenylpropanoids dillapiol and myristicin presented relevant contents in the 368 fresh leaves of this vegetable. In contrast to previous studies, the sesquiterpene fraction 369 was accumulated in higher percentage in our water celery materials, differences that 370 may be related to the extraction protocol and analysis of the VOCs. In fact, the HS-371 SPME technique employed in the current study allowed identifying germacrene D as 372 Versión autor 16  the main compound of water celery, together with limonene and allo-ocimene. 373 Differences found among the populations for these contents and relative abundance may 374 present a genetic component, thus allowing the selection of materials according to 375 consumers' preferences. 376 The particular aroma of water celery, although unique, presented similarities in the 377 relative abundance of different VOCs with their relatives. These similarities would 378 account for the similarities in the aroma of water celery and the other species. In 379 addition, the sesquiterpene family of VOCs was accumulated in higher concentration in 380 water celery, which would be reflected in a more intense aroma with herbal, spicy and 381 citrus notes. Therefore, this distinct aroma quality may be useful for the differentiation 382 and enhancement of water celery as new salad ingredient, enhancing its value as a 383 potential new crop for vegetable diversification.  384  385 Declarations of interest 386 None. 387  388 Acknowledgments 389 C.
