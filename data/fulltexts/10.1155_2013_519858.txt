The analyses of theethanolic extract of T. catharinensis by mass spectrometry allowed identifying the presence of the alkaloids 16-epi-affinine,coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine, voachalotine, voacristine-hydroxyindolenine, and 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, as wellas an alkaloid with m/z 385.21 whose spectrum suggests a derivative of voacristine or voacangine. The extract and itsalkaloid rich fractions showed antioxidant activity, especially those that contain the alkaloid m/z 385.21 or 16-epi-affininewith DPPH scavenging activity (IC50) between 37.18 and 74.69 𝜇g/mL. Moreover, the extract and its fractions exhibitedanticholinesterasic activity, particularly the fractions characterized by the presence of 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine,with IC50= 2.1 to 2.5 𝜇g/mL. Fractions with 16-epi-affinine combined good antioxidant (IC50= 65.59 to 74.69 𝜇g/mL) andanticholinesterasic (IC50=7.7 to 8.3𝜇g/mL) activities, representing an option for further studies aimed at treating neurodegenerativediseases.1. IntroductionAlzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative dis-order related to genetic predisposition and characterized bythe presence of neurofibrillary tangles, formation of extra-cellular deposition of 𝛽-amyloid peptide, oxidative stress,increased production of superoxide radicals, and reducedneurotransmitter levels [1, 2]. The treatments available tocombat the symptoms of this condition are complex andinclude increasing acetylcholine levels in brain regions suchas frontal cortex and hippocampus and possibly preventingneuronal degeneration with antioxidants [3].Natural products derived from plants represent a viablealternative for discovering new potentially active substances.Tabernaemontana catharinensis ADC is a small tree of theApocynaceae family currently found in Brazil, Argentina,Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia [4]. The genus Tabernae-montana has evoked interest due to the important biologicactivity of its extracts, particularly, antimicrobial [5, 6], anti-tumoral [7], antioxidant [8], anti-cholinesterasic [9], andanti-inflammatory [10] activities, most of which have beenassociated with indole alkaloids. Although several biologicalactivities of T. catharinensis extracts have been reported, fewsubstances with anticholinesterase activity able to minimizedamage caused by oxidative stress have been described inT. catharinensis. The association of these properties mayrepresent an alternative for the control of neurodegenerativedisorders as Alzheimer’s disease.In view of the foregoing, the present work aimed toevaluate the content of the ethanolic extract obtained fromthe aerial parts of T. catharinensis as well as to examine thein vitro antioxidant and anticholinesterase activity of the2 The Scientific World Journalextract and itsmain fractions and to relate biological activitiesto the identified compounds.2. Materials and MethodsTwenty samples of Tabernaemontana catharinensis were col-lected in Santo Angelo, RS, Brazil (28∘27󸀠59󸀠󸀠S, 54∘29󸀠37󸀠󸀠W)in November 2008. The plants were identified by professorRonaldo A. Wasum and deposited in the herbarium ofUniversidade de Caxias do Sul (HUCS 34038–34057/guia1669).After the removal of inflorescences, the terminal regionsof aerial parts (leaves and branches) were dried in a green-house with forced air circulation at a temperature of 30∘Cfor 4 days. The dry material was grinded in a Willey TE 650grinder mill and stored in container protected from light forsubsequent analysis.2.1. Methods of Extraction and Purification. The trituratedvegetal material underwent extraction with a Soxhlet appara-tus using ethanol as extraction solvent (10mL ethanol/g) for12 hours at a temperature of nearly 70∘C.The ethanolic extractwas concentrated in a rotary evaporator at reduced pressureuntil complete removal of the solvent.According to the methodology described by Guida et al.[11], 150mL of hydrochloric acid at 2% were added to each 10grams of dry extract and extractedwith 200mLof chloroform(fraction named B1). The acid aqueous phase was alkalinizedwith sodium hydroxide 10% until pH 7.8 and extracted with200mL of chloroform (fraction B2). The aqueous phase wasalkalinized until pH 11.2 with solution of sodium hydroxide10% and extracted with 200mL of chloroform (fraction B3)(Figure 1).Fractions B1, B2, and B3 were monitored by thin-layerchromatography (TLC) using aluminium chromatoplatesprecoated with silica gel F2540.2mm (Merck) with eluentsystem CH2Cl2:MeOH (93 : 7). Bands were visualized underultraviolet light (254 and 365 nm) after staining with Dragen-dorff ’s reagent.Fractions B2 and B3 had similar chromatographic pro-files by TLC and were gathered. The mixture of thesefractions underwent column chromatography using Mercksilica gel (0.06–0.2) as a support and dichloromethane,dichloromethane with increasing percentages of methanolandmethanol as eluent, according to Gower et al. [12]. A totalof 14 fractions of 100ml each were collected and monitoredby TLC, using the same procedure previously described andgathered according to the similarities observed, resulting in 6fractions (C1–C6).2.2. Identification of Alkaloids by Mass Spectrometry. Theextract and fractions of T. catharinensis were dissolved ina solution of 50% (v/v) chromatographic grade acetonitrile(Tedia, Fairfield, OH, USA), acidified with 0.1% formic acid.The solutions were individually infused directly into theelectrospray ionization (ESI) source by means of a syringepump (Harvard Apparatus) at a flow rate of 10 𝜇Lmin−1.Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI(+)-MS) andtandem ESI(+)-MS/MS were acquired using a hybrid highresolution and high accuracy (5 𝜇L/L) Orbitrap XL massspectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under the followingconditions: capillary and cone voltages were set to +3500Vand +40V, respectively, with a desolvation temperature of100∘C. For ESI(+)-MS/MS, the energy for the collision-induced dissociations (CID) was optimized for each compo-nent. Diagnostic ions in different fractions were identified bythe comparison of their ESI(+)-MS/MS dissociation patternswith those of compounds identified in previous studies. Fordata acquisition and processing, Xcalibur software (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used.The data were collected in them/zrange of 70–700, providing the resolution of 50,000 (FWHM)atm/z 200. No important ions were observed belowm/z 200or above𝑚/𝑧 650.2.3. Determination of Antioxidant Activity. The antioxidantactivity was measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl rad-ical (DPPH∙) scavenging activity [13]. Extract and fractions(B1–B3, C1–C6) of T. catharinensis (200𝜇L) were added toTris-HCl buffer 100mM (pH 7.4, 800𝜇L) and 1mL DPPH∙(500𝜇M dissolved in ethanol). The tubes were stored in thedark at room temperature for 20min and absorbance wasmeasured at 517 nm. Samples, blanks, and positive controls(ascorbic acid) were assessed in triplicate. Results wereexpressed as IC50, that is, the amount of the extract neededto scavenge 50% of DPPH∙.2.4. Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity (AChE) and Eval-uation of Kinetic Parameters. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitoryactivity was determined from the assay described by Ellmanet al. [14]. Acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) and 5,5󸀠dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) were used as solvent andreagent for activity determination. Experiments used acetyl-cholinesterase from electric eel (Electrophorus electricus),Sigma C2888. In 96-well microplates, the reaction mixturecontaining 185 𝜇L of sodium phosphate buffer (concentra-tion 0.1M) pH 8.0, 5𝜇L of DTNB (concentration 0.3mM),5 𝜇L of ATCI (concentration 0.5Mm), and 5 𝜇L of solutionwere stored at a temperature of 25∘C. Hydrolysis of ATCIinitiated with the addition of 20𝜇L of enzyme suspension(concentration 0.032U/mL) and then microplates were readat 405 nm every 30 s for 2min. Samples, blanks, and positivecontrols (galantamine) were assessed in triplicate.The resultswere expressed as IC50, that is, the concentration required toinhibit 50% enzymatic activity.The same methodology was used to evaluate kineticparameters, except for DTNB content (concentration 1mM)and multiple ATCI concentrations (0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1.35, 1.8, and3mM) [15, 16]. Negative and positive controls (galantamine0.2 and 1 𝜇g/mL) and fraction C6 (0.25, 1 and 100 𝜇g/mL)were assessed in triplicate. The values obtained were graphedaccording to the Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burkmodels.2.5. Statistical Analysis.

Results and DiscussionESI(+)-MS analysis of the raw extract of T. catharinensisrevealed the presence of chemicals with molecular weightranging from 203 to 487 (Figure 2). The results obtainedin this study, also considering previous reports of thegenus Tabernaemontana [17, 20], indicated the pres-ence of the following alkaloids: 16-epi-affinine (m/z325.1911), coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine (m/z 355.2019),voachalotine (m/z 367.2020), voacristine-hydroxyindolenine(m/z 401.2072), 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine (m/z4 The Scientific World Journal100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundance309.1972291.1855158.0965138.0915202.1226172.1124 238.1233 262.1473122.0968 224.1436 321.1849 337.1407NNOHAffinisine 309.1972−OHNNNHNHHONOH 291. 1855: C20H22N2202. 1226: C13H16NO−158. 0965: C11H12N−138. 0915: C8H12NO−−C12H12N−C9H12NO−C7H8NFigure 3: ESI(+)-MS/MS of affinisine.411.2280), and of an unidentified compound with m/z385.2125, whose fragmentation profile suggested a derivativeof voacristine or voacangine.Table 1 lists the compounds identified in the raw extractof T. catharinensis by ESI(+)-MS as well as the analyses of themain precursor ions by ESI(+)-MS/MS. Indole alkaloids werecharacterized by the important ability to stabilize positivecharges, provided by the nitrogen atom and by the presenceof carboxyl groups that can be ruptured in situations ofionization [23]. These characteristics can be evidenced inFigure 3, in which, through ion isolation and fragmentations,it was possible to confirm the chemical structure of theaffinisine compound.The fractions obtained from the dry extract were analyzedby ESI(+)-MS (Figure 4). Fractions B2 and B3 (0.4% of theinitial material) had similar chromatographic profiles by TLCand showed significant differences in the spectrum obtainedby ESI(+)-MS. Fractions C1 and C2 were characterized bythe presence of the possible derivative of voacristine orvoacangine (m/z 385.2134). On the other hand, fractions C3and C4 had a higher peak corresponding to 16-epi-affinine(m/z 325.1911) as well as an unidentified compound with m/z311.1769. Fractions C5 and C6, in turn, had 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine (m/z 411.2171) as the most intense peakin the spectrum.Of the compounds identified in the raw extract ofT. catharinensis, affinisine was previously described inT. catharinensis extracts [24] as well as in extracts fromT. buchtieni [25], T. fuchsiaefolia [17], and T. histrix [9].In turn, 16-epi-affinine was identified in T. catharinensis,T. latea, T. pachysiphon and T. psychotrifolia [18], and T.fuchsiaefolia [22]. Vobasine is present in several species ofthe genus Tabernaemontana, including T. catharinensis [21].Coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine, in turn, was identified in T.catharinensis extracts [20] and was also found in T. divaricata[26],T. buchtieni [25], andT. heyneana [27].Voachalotine and12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine were detected in extractsfrom T. catharinensis [20] and T. fuchsiaefolia [17], amongother species of the genus. Voacristine-hydroxyindolenine, inturn, was described in T. apoda and T. dichotoma [21], in T.buchtieni [25], and also in T. heyneana [27].Thus, generally speaking, the compounds identified in theraw ethanolic extract of T. catharinensis are consistent withprevious studies on this vegetal species. However, the majorindole alkaloids, voacangine, and coronaridine, describedin branch extracts obtained by supercritical CO2[28, 29]and in leaf ethanolic extracts [29], were not detected inthe present research. The absence of these compounds maybe attributed to environmental and genetic differences inthe evaluated material, or to the analysis methods used,since these authors employed liquid chromatographic/massspectrometric (LC/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spec-trometry (GC/MS), respectively. It is worth highlighting thatcoronaridine-hydroxyindolenine and a possible derivative ofThe Scientific World Journal 5Table1:ChemicalcompositionofT.catharinensisextractbyESI(+)-MSeESI(+)-MS/MS.EntryPrecursorion𝑚/𝑧Fragmentationms/ms(%)[MS2]{MS3}IdentificationElem.comp.Diff.ppmFragmentationpathwaysReferences1309.1963291.1864(35);202.1232(5);158.0968(17);138.0917(16)AffinisineC 20H24N2O0.646291.1864[M-OH];202.1232[M-C7H8N];158.0968[M-C9H12NO][9,17]2325.1918308.1891(15);307.1814(13)[289.1706(4);265.1700(100){234.1281(11);122.0966(8)}176.1071(5)];265.1706(5);152.1074(12)16-epi-AffinineC 20H24N2O22.460308.1891[M-OH];265.1700[M-C2H3O2];152.1074[M-C11H10NO][18]3353.1866322.1443(9);321.1606(33),[293.1654(65),275.1548(22)264.1388(100),221.1078(24),211.0870(65),183.0921(98)]290.1184(6)VobasineC 21H24N2O31.981322.1443[M-C2H6];293.1654[M-C2H4O2]275.1548[M-C2H6O3];264.1388[M-C3H7NO2][19]4355.2023337.1920(100)[305.1656(60);277.1706(21);216.1024(8);144.0811(9)];323.1762(7);305.1657(60)[290.1418(22);277.1704(100){207.0921(10)};235.0869(67);184.0760(36);174.0916(33)]Coronaridine-hydroxyindolenineC 21H26N2O31.970337.1920[M-OH];323.1762[M-CH3O]305.1657[M-CH4O2];277.1704[M-C2H5O3][20]5367.2023337.1921(100)[305.1655(28);172.1125(16);158.0967(34)];335.1765(7);305.1658(23);172.1126(31);166.0868(5);158.0969(7)VoachalotineC 22H26N2O31.906337.1921[M-CH3OH];305.1655[M-C2H4O2]172.1125[M-C12H12NO3];158.0969[M-C11H15NO3][21]6385.2128367.2024(100),[335.1761(100),{307.1812(40),265.0977(21),214.0867(9),174.0917(15)};307.1810(100)246.1130(19);174.0918(10)];335.1765(20);307.1815(7)Derivativeofvoacristineorvoacanginen.d7401.2075383.1975(100)[365.1867(100);{333.1604(20);201.1026(26)}351.1711(21);337.1553(21);201.0976(23)];365.1867(62);[351.1711(21);337.1553(21);333.1605(7);323.1760(8);201.1027(23)];351.1715(7);201.1029(6)Voacristine-hydroxyindolenineC 22H28N2O51.246383.1975[M-OH];365.1867[M-O2H4]351.1711[M-CH7O2];333.1604[M-CH7O3]201.1027[M-C10H15O4][17]8411.2283381.2181(100);349.1917(100);[334.1681(16);321.1966(10);317.1654(15);266.1544(35);{251.1309(21);237.1151(44)}];200.1076(100);[185.0839(14);169.0890(12)];180.1024(25)12-Methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotineC 24H31N2O41.215381.2181[M-CH4O];349.1917[M-C2H6O2]334.1681[M-C3H8O2];321.1966[M-C3H7O3]200.1076[M-C11H15NO3][22]9415.2126nini:notidentificated.6 The Scientific World Journal200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600m/z0102030405060708090100B1288.2907316.3225415.2127385.21437.1953453.1674Relative abundance200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceB2309.1956325.1911385.2134411.2271415.2127432.2373401200 240 280 320 360 400 440m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceB3385.2130325.1907309.1973 355.20C1200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundance385.2134355.2023 401.2069200 250 300 350 400 450 500m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceC3325.1919309.1971371.1972401.2027200 250 300 350 400 450 500m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceC4325.1911311.1769355.2025371.1983385427.2230265.1703200 250 300 350 400 450 500m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceC5411.2271427.2230337.1905385m/z280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 4800102030405060708090100Relative abundanceC6411.2266427.2233325.1919200 250 300 350 400 450 500m/z0102030405060708090100Relative abundanceC2385.2134355.2023401.2074411.2280254.1834288.2902411.2298Figure 4: 2 Electrospray positive spectra of fractions B1–B3, C1–C6.voacristine or voacangine were detected in the raw extractand in some of its fractions.The extract of T. catharinensis and its fractions wereevaluated with regard to their DPPH∙ scavenging activity, amethod routinely used and recognized due to its practicalityand rapidity [30, 31]. According to the results shown inTable 2, the raw extract exhibited DPPH∙ scavenging activitywith IC50of 313.46 𝜇g/mL. Fraction B1, which had low con-tent of alkaloids according to the chromatographic analysis,exhibited lower antioxidant activity than the raw extract, withIC50of 1.590.00𝜇g/mL.Fractions C1 and C2, which had similar spectra, with thepresence of a possible derivative of voacristine or voacangine,showed a significant difference in their antioxidant activities.We suggest that the higher activity observed in fraction C2may be attributed to other unidentified compounds or to itscontent of coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine (Figure 4). Onthe other hand, fractions C3 and C4, characterized by thepresence of 16-epi-affinine and of an unidentified compoundwith m/z 311.1769, exhibited similar antioxidant activity,close to that of fractions B2 and B3. The lower antioxidantactivity among the fractions obtained by chromatographicseparation was observed in fractions C5 and C6, whichwere characterized by the presence of 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine.Table 2: Antioxidant and anticholinesterasic activity of T. cathari-nensis extract and fractions.Samples DPPH-IC50(𝜇g/mL)AChEinhibition-IC50(𝜇g/mL)Extract 313.46 ± 0.5b 261.55 ± 9.1bOrganic/aqueus fractionsB1 1590.00 ± 1.4a 458.40 ± 8.2aB2 60.75 ± 0.5e 18.35 ± 1.4dB3 67.28 ± 0.6e 9.0 ± 0.4ec. column fractionsC1 94.92 ± 0.05d 17.35 ± 1.4dC2 37.18 ± 0.1f 91.22 ± 7.1cC3 74.69 ± 0.9e 7.71 ± 0.1eC4 65.59 ± 0.3e 8.34 ± 0.6eC5 230.25 ± 0.1c 2.50 ± 0.1fC6 249.61 ± 0.9c 2.10 ± 0.1fAscorbic acid 20.13 ± 0.45g —Galantamine — 0.2 ± 0.05gDifferent letters correspond to values statistically different by analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc test, for 𝑃 ≤ 0.05, for each activity.The Scientific World Journal 7C6 100𝜇g/mLC6 1𝜇g/mLC6 0.25 𝜇g/mLC6 0𝜇g/mL00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090 1 2 3mMolar ATCImMolar/min(a)−1001020304050607080−0.7 −0.2 0.3 0.8 1.3 1.8 2.30𝜇g/mL100𝜇g/mL 1𝜇g/mL1/mMolar ATCI1/mMolar/min0.25 𝜇g/mL(b)−1000100200300400500600700−0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5Gal 0𝜇g/mLGal 0.2 𝜇g/mLGal 1𝜇g/mL1/mMolar/min1/mMolar ATCI(c)Figure 5: Kinetic study of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by C6 fraction and galantamine (standard acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). (a)Michaelis-Menten kinetic for C6 fraction, (b) double reciprocal (Lineweaver Burk) plot for C6 fraction, and (c) double reciprocal (Line-weaver Burk) plot for galantamine.The antioxidant activity of the raw extract from the aerialparts of T. catharinensis was lower than that observed inroot ethanolic extracts of this species (IC50= 100 𝜇g/mL)[32] but higher than that identified in ethanolic extracts ofT. heyneana leaves (IC50= 537 𝜇g/mL) [33].Indole alkaloids have been previously described asexhibiting antioxidant activity [32, 34]. Studies showed thatreactive oxygen species uptake activity in indole deriva-tives could be related to the exceptional redox propertyof the indole ring, which is especially conferred by theindole nitrogen [35]. Among the indole alkaloids present inTabernaemontana, antioxidant activity has been identified forisovoacristine-hydroxyindolenine and voacangine [32]. Onthe other hand, variations in the content of coronaridine andvoacangine in T. catharinensis extracts did not change in vitroantioxidant potential [8].The results for the inhibitory activity of the extractof T. catharinensis and its fractions on acetylcholinesterase(AChE) enzyme using Ellman’s method [14] can also beobserved in Table 2. The raw extract had the ability ofinhibiting AChE enzyme (IC50= 261.55 𝜇g/mL). This anti-acetylcholinesterase activity was previously reported in theethanolic extract of Tabernaemontana divaricata roots (IC50= 2.56𝜇g/mL), in which there has been also reports ofselective and reversible enzyme inhibition [36].Fractions B2 and B3, as well as samples obtainedby column fractionation, showed higher values for AChEenzyme inhibition when compared to the value observedfor the raw extract. Fractions C5 and C6 were those thatobtained better results for AChE inhibition, with IC50of2.50 𝜇g/mL and 2.10 𝜇g/mL, respectively. On the other hand,fraction B1 exhibited low anticholinesterase activity (IC50=458.40 𝜇g/mL). These results corroborate previous reports8 The Scientific World Journalthat mentioned the anticholinesterase potential of alkaloidsfound in the genus Tabernaemontana and the possibility ofusing these compounds for studies involving the treatment ofneurodegenerative diseases [9, 24].Significant enzyme inhibition activities were observed infractions C3 (IC507.71𝜇g/mL), C4 (IC508.34 𝜇g/mL), andB3 (IC509.0 𝜇g/mL). These fractions were characterized bythe presence of the compounds affinisine, 16-epi-affinine,vobasine, and coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine. In previ-ous reports, affinine and affinisine inhibited AChE enzyme[9, 24]. On the other hand, vobasine and coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine showed low inhibition results at theconcentrations evaluated by Zhan et al. [37].Recent studies related the molecular structure of indolealkaloids to AChE inhibitory capacity, based on compoundssimilar to coronaridine. It was observed that structureswith hydrophobic substituents or electron-donor substituentsexhibited higher inhibitory activity when compared to theirhydroxylated derivatives [37]. However, these attributeswere not observed with isovoacangine and its hydroxilatedderivative [9]. Representatives of the Corinantea class suchas 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, were characterizedby exhibiting antiacetylcholinesterase activity [24]. It isworth stressing that this case requires further clarificationwhen relating structure to activity potential, taking intoaccount that n-methyl-voachalotine showed negative resultsfor enzyme inhibition in previous reports [9].In an attempt of understanding inhibition results forfraction C6, kinetic studies were conducted, which maysuggest possible models of interaction between AChE andits inhibitors [38]. It is known so far that AChE, an enzymebelonging to the family of 𝛼𝛽 hydrolases, has two mainbinding sites: an active site (ACS) and an anionic site (PAS)[39]. Figure 5 shows the models of enzyme kinetics andMichaelis-Menten as well as the linear model describedby Lineweaver-Burk with different inhibitor concentrations(fraction C6).According to the graph that associated varied substrateconcentrations (1/mMolar ATCI) with velocities of productformation (1/mMolar/min) (Figure 5(b)), it is possible to findthat high substrate concentrations displace the balance of thereaction and favor the formation of the enzyme-substratecomplex, thus reducing the likelihood of the inhibitor (C6)to bond to the enzyme active site. This characteristic canbe observed when considering the intersection between thereaction with and without the inhibitor on the 𝑦-axis. Thisbehavior is typical of competitive inhibitors such as galan-tamine (Figure 5(c)), as described byKhan et al. [38]. In addi-tion, the maximum velocity of product formation obtainedin the absence or presence of C6 inhibitor at different con-centrations remained constant (𝑉max = 0.079mMolar/min),and different 𝐾𝑚values were observed in the absence of theinhibitor (𝐾𝑚= 0.28mMolarATCI) and in the presence of C6at a 1𝜇g/mL concentration (𝐾𝑚= 1.20mMolar ATCI). Thisis the first report of a kinetic study involving the model ofinteraction between AChE and fractions containing indolealkaloids found in Tabernaemontana, suggesting competitiveinhibitory action.Structures with quaternary nitrogen exhibit significantbinding activity to aromatic wastes at the AChE activesite [40], which justifies the activity of the fraction C6according to the structural characteristics of the compound12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, themost intense peak inC6 spectrum. However, it is worth emphasizing the need ofpurifying this compound in order to confirm these results.Even so, there is the possibility that the alkaloids describedin this paper exhibit also bonding connection to subtypesof receptors, similar to other compounds already evaluated[41]; therefore, in vitro studies are also necessary in order toexamine these possible mechanisms.Given the potential of the extracts of T. catharinensis andtheir compounds, further investigations should be conductedwith the purpose of purifying, identifying, and confirmingtheir biological properties, having in view their therapeuticuse.References[1] M.
