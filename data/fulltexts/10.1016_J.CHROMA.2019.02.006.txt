UPLC-MS/MS chromatograms (total ion chromatograms (TIC): relative abundance of the base peaks vs. retention time) of Morus alba root bark samples collected from Serbia (1) and China (17).   S 1.1 UPLC-MS/MS analysis  Using the negative ionization mode, compound I produced ions at m/z values of 405, 243, 225, and 199, corresponding to the successive neutral losses of one glucosyl group, another glucosyl group, and a H2O moiety or a CO2 molecule (Table 1). Compound II recognized as moracin M has a main fragment at m/z 197 (Table 1) [22]. Compound III with a molecular ion at m/z 325 gave ion species m/z 283 and 253; ion at m/z 253 was formed by elimination of a C4H8O group [22]. Compounds IV and V (presumably sanggenon T and its isomer) with a molecular ion at m/z 711 was identified in Chinese samples. In the case of compounds IV and V, three ions, m/z 601 and 549, 491, were obtained [22]. Compound VI recognized as kuwanon L produced fragment ions at m/z 499, 471, 389, whereas an ion at m/z 499 was formed by elimination of C6H6O2 [20, 22] (Table 1). Compound VII with a molecular ion at m/z 707, and characteristic fragments at m/z 489, 369, 325, 300, 259, 227 was compared with the reference compound and was accordingly identified as sanggenon D (Table 1) [21, 22]. Compound IX (kuwanon G) and its 11  isomer (compound XVIII) with a molecular ion at m/z 691 produced two characteristic fragment ions at m/z 581 and 471, corresponding to the loss of one and two resorcinol (C6H6O2) groups [21, 22]. Compounds VIII, X and XI with molecular ions at m/z 569, 707, 693 were recognized as sanggenons B, C, G, respectively. The mass spectra of the above mentioned compounds were confirmed with reference compounds and literature data [20, 22]. In case of sanggenon C, neutral losses of two resorcinol (C6H6O2, 110 Da) groups were also observed for the deprotonated ion (m/z 707) of sanggenon C under negative ionization [22]. Sanggenon G with a molecular ion at m/z 693, produced an ion at m/z 583, which corresponds to C34H31O9- and a fragment at m/z 531 obtained after a loss of C9H5O3 corresponding to C31H31O8- (Table 1). Compound XII with a molecular ion at m/z 423, recognized as sanggenol A, produced ions at m/z 298, 245, 151, 126: the fragmentation pattern was confirmed by comparison with the reference compound and literature data [22]. Compound XIII (kuwanon C) produced fragment ions of m/z 352, 309, 231, confirmed by literature data [22]. Compound XIV with a quasi-molecular ion of m/z 419, produced ions at m/z 375, 350, 309, and 297 based on the mass spectral profiles. The quasi- molecular ions of compound XV (m/z 437) corresponding to morunigrol was tentatively identified based on the mass spectral profiles (Table 1) [22]. Further, the diagnostic product ions of the deprotonated ion (m/z of 243 for [M-H]-) of compound XVI (sanggenol B) were generated at m/z values of 445, 364, 351, 309 and 257, as described in literature [22]. The molecular ion of compound XVII at m/z 487 was tentatively assigned as andalasin A: there are two characteristic ions at m/z 349 and 231 [22].
