ABSTRACT 24 
A total of 38 phenolic compounds in the solid/liquid extracts of five Lamiaceae spices 25 
such as rosemary, oregano, sage, basil and thyme were identified in the present study 26 
using LC-ESI-MS/MS. These compounds were distributed in four major categories 27 
namely hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, flavonoids 28 
and phenolic terpenes. Among them, the category of flavonoids was the largest with 17 29 
compounds. Identification of the phenolic compounds was carried out by comparing 30 
retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. In case of 31 
unavailability of standards, phenolic compounds were identified based on accurate mass 32 
of pseudomolecular [M-H]- ions and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. The 33 
results of accurate mass measurements fitted well with the elemental composition of the 34 
compounds. The diagnostic fragmentation patterns of the compounds during collision 35 
induced dissociation (CID) elucidated structural information of the compounds analysed. 36

INTRODUCTION 47 
It is well known that Lamiaceae spices have potent antioxidant properties, mostly due to 48 
the polyphenolic compounds present in them (1, 2). Recently, interest has increased 49 
considerably in naturally occurring antioxidant for use in foods as replacements for 50 
synthetic antioxidants such as BHA and BHT, whose use is being restricted due to 51 
concerns over safety (3, 4). Natural antioxidants can protect the human body from free 52 
radicals and could retard the progress of many chronic diseases as well as lipid oxidative 53 
rancidity in foods (5-7). Oxidation of lipids in food not only lowers the nutritional value 54 
(8), but is also associated with cell membrane damage, aging, heart disease and cancer in 55 
living organisms (9). Therefore the addition of natural antioxidants to food products has 56 
become popular as a means of increasing shelf life and to reduce wastage and nutritional 57 
losses by inhibiting and delaying oxidation (10). As previously stated spices in the 58 
Lamiaceae family are a well known source of antioxidants particularly polyphenols. 59 
Furthermore, spices have been used for many years to enhance the sensory attributes such 60 
as taste and aroma of foods (11). Since these spices are commonly consumed in most 61 
countries, there are no legal barriers to use them in foods. However, their use in foods as 62 
either a control measure for lipid oxidation or increase inherent antioxidant capacity 63 
requires detailed characterization of the compounds responsible for their antioxidant 64 
properties. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry 65 
(LC-ESI-MS/MS) has been recognized as a powerful analytical tool with its high 66 
sensitivity, short run time and less use of toxic organic solvents used as mobile phase 67 
compared to reversed phase stand alone HPLC coupled with Diode-Array Detector (12-68 
15). A previous LC-ESI-MS study of polyphenols in Lamiaceae family by Møller et al. 69 
(16) investigated the major fingerprint ions in methanolic extracts of three variants of 70 
oregano and rosemary, however,  only two polyphenols, rosmarinic acid and kaempferol, 71 
were identified in these extracts despite the fact that many other polyphenolic compounds 72 
have been identified in these species by other methods. However, Herrero et al. (17) 73 
reported 14 compounds in the pressurized liquid extract of rosemary by LC-ESI-MS 74 
method. Other studies (18-22) also identified similar number of compounds in different 75 
members of the family. In the present study we examined 38 polyphenols in five 76 
Lamiaceae spices using liquid chromatographic separation and collision induced 77 
dissociation analysis. Furthermore, accurate mass measurement technique was 78 
successfully applied for the first time in this spice family to elucidate the elemental 79 
composition of the polyphenols studied.  80 
 81 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 82 
Samples and reagents. Dried and ground rosemary, oregano, sage, basil and thyme were 83 
provided by AllinAll Ingredients Ltd., Dublin 12, Ireland. According to product 84 
specifications, the country of origin of the spices used was Turkey. The spices were air 85 
dried after heat treatment (steam sterilization at 120 °C for 30 sec). The dried spices were 86 
ground (particle size range: 500 to 600 µm) and stored at -20 °C in darkness. Seventeen 87 
standards namely caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, carnosic acid, carnosol, ferulic acid, 88 
gallic acid, gallocatechin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, phloridzin, protocatechuic acid, p-89 
coumaric acid, quercetin, rosmarinic acid, rutin, syringic acid, thymol and vanillic acid 90 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Four flavonoid standards, such as apigenin, 91 
apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin and luteolin-7-O-glucoside were purchased from 92 
Extrasynthese, France. HPLC grade methanol and water were purchased from VWR 93 
International Limited, Leicestershire, UK and Lennox Laboratory Supplies Limited, 94 
Dublin, Ireland respectively. The purity of standards and solvents were in the range of 95 95 
% to 99.8 %. Only luteolin-7-O-glucoside and carnosic acid had 90 % and 91 % purity 96 
respectively.   97 
  98 
Preparation of solid/liquid extracts. Dried and ground spice samples (1 g) were 99 
homogenised for 1 min at 24,000 rpm using an Ultra-Turrax T-25 Tissue homogenizer 100 
(Janke & Kunkel, IKA-Labortechnik, Saufen, Germany) in 25 mL of 80% methanol in 101 
the dark at room temperature (~23 °C). Aqueous methanol (80 %) was chosen for its high 102 
efficiency in extracting polyphenols from plant samples (2). The homogenised sample 103 
suspension was shaken overnight with a V400 Multitude Vortexer (Alpha laboratories, 104 
North York, Canada) at 1,500 rpm and room temperature. The mixture was then 105 
centrifuged for 15 min at 2,000 g (MSE Mistral 3000i, Sanyo Gallenkamp, 106 
Leicestershire, UK) and filtered through 0.22 µm polytetrafluoethylene (PTFE) filters 107 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). The extracts were analyzed immediately after 108 
extraction. 109 
 110 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS analysis was 111 
performed on a Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Micromass MS 112 
Technologies, Manchester, UK coupled to Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters 113 
Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The Q-Tof Premier is equipped with a lockspray 114 
source where an internal reference compound (Leucine-Enkephalin) was introduced 115 
simultaneously with the analyte for accurate mass measurements. Compounds were 116 
separated on an Atlantis T3 C18 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA, 100 mm x 117 
2.1 mm; 3 µm particle size) using 0.5% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.5% formic 118 
acid in 50/50 v/v acetonitrile:methanol (solvent B).  Column temperature was maintained 119 
at 40 °C. A stepwise gradient from 10% to 90% solvent B was applied at a flow rate of 120 
0.2 mL/min for 26 min. Electrospray mass spectra data were recorded on a negative 121 
ionisation mode for a mass range m/z 100 to m/z 1000.  Capillary voltage and cone 122 
voltage were set at 3 kV and 30 V respectively. Collision induced fragmentation (CID) of 123 
the analytes was achieved using 12 eV to 20 eV energy with argon as the collision gas. 124 
 125 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 126 
A total of 38 polyphenols distributed in four major categories; hydroxycinnamic acid 127 
derivatives, hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, flavonoids and phenolic terpenes have been 128 
analyzed in the present study. Figure 1 shows the total ion current (TIC) chromatogram 129 
of rosemary extract and the major peaks observed has been assigned in Table 1. Since 130 
polyphenols contain one or more hydroxyl and/or carboxylic acid groups, MS data were 131 
acquired in negative ionization mode.  Identification of the phenolic compounds was 132 
carried out by comparing retention times and their masses with those of the 21 authentic 133 
standards. For the remaining 17 compounds for which no standards were available 134 
identification was based on accurate mass measurements of the pseudomolecular [M-H]- 135 
ions and CID fragment ions. Results of accurate mass measurements matched the 136 
elemental composition of all the compounds analyzed (Table 1). Data obtained from the 137 
ESI-MS analyses of the extracts of five Lamiaceae spices are summarized in Table 1. The 138 
following sections outline conditions used to identify each of the compounds (arranged 139 
into their constituent groups), fragmentation patterns and occurrence in each of the spice 140 
extracts. 141 
 142 
Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives 143 
Seven different polyphenols in the category of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were 144 
found to occur in all the spices examined. Five of them namely caffeic acid, chlorogenic 145 
acid, p-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid and ferulic acid were identified by comparing their 146 
retention times and characteristic MS spectral data with those of authentic standards 147 
(Table 1). Accurate mass measurements and fragmentation pattern during CID further 148 
confirmed their structural composition. The pseudomolecular ions of p-coumaric acid 149 
(m/z 163.04) and ferulic acid (m/z 193.05) produced the major fragment ions at m/z 119.0 150 
and m/z 149.0 respectively during CID corresponding to the loss of carbon dioxide from 151 
the precursor ion. Gruz et al. (23) reported the same fragmentation pattern of these 152 
compounds in white wine. The other fragment generated during CID of ferulic acid was 153 
at m/z 178.0 due to initial loss of a methyl group from the precursor ion. The remaining 154 
two hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives; caffeic acid hexoside and dicaffeoylquinic acid 155 
were identified by their accurate mass measurements and MS/MS spectral data.  156 
The tentative mass spectrum for caffeic acid showed the deprotonated molecule [M-H]-  157 
ion at m/z 179.03 at 1.57 min. The major fragment ions produced by CID analysis were 158 
m/z 161.0 and m/z 135.0 corresponding to loss of water and carbon dioxide molecules 159 
respectively from the precursor ion. Generally, deprotonated phenolic acids [M-H]- 160 
produce a typical fragmentation pattern after collision induced dissociation, characterised 161 
by the loss of a CO2 (44 u) from the carboxylic acid group, providing an anion of [M-H-162 
COO]- (24). Other fragment ions m/z 113.0, 101.0 and 71.0 unique to caffeic acid were 163 
also observed. These ions were produced as a result of the cleavage of the phenolic ring 164 
of the precursor ion at m/z 179.0 at different sites as illustrated in Figure 2.  Similar 165 
fragment ions were seen when the precursor [M-H]-ions of m/z 341.10 eluting at 1.53 166 
min, m/z 353.09 at 3.91 min and m/z 515.10 eluting at 10.01 min were subjected to CID. 167 
This confirmed that these precursor molecular ions were associated with caffeic acid. For 168 
instance m/z 341.10 ions were identified as deprotonated caffeic acid hexoside. The loss 169 
of a hexose moiety (162 u) resulted in a dominant fragment ion at m/z 179.0 170 
corresponding to deprotonated caffeic acid. It must also be noted that a dicaffeic acid 171 
would also generate similar precursor and fragment ions as that of caffeic acid hexoside. 172 
In this context, application of accurate mass measurement discriminated caffeic acid 173 
hexoside (calculated from [M-H]-= 341.0873) from dicaffeic acid (calculated from [M-174 
H]-= 341.0660). The MS/MS on the precursor m/z 353.09 ions identified as chlorogenic 175 
acid gave dominant product ions m/z 191.1, m/z 179.0 and m/z 173.0. The product ions 176 
m/z 191.1 for quinic acid and 179.0 for caffeic acid revealed the constituent of 177 
chlorogenic acid prior to condensation. Loss of a caffeoyl moiety yielded the other 178 
dominant fragment ion m/z 173.0. The MS/MS on precursor [M-H]- ion at m/z 515.10 179 
showed product ions of m/z 353.0, m/z 191.0 and m/z 179.0 corresponding to the 180 
pseudomolecular ions of caffeoylquinic acid, quinic acid and caffeic acid respectively in 181 
addition to the finger-print fragment ions of caffeic acid. Thus this compound was 182 
identified as dicaffeoylquinic acid. A similar fragmentation of the compound was 183 
reported by Parejo et al. (24) in fennel extract.  The CID experiment on [M-H]- ion at m/z 184 
359.08 identified as rosmarinic acid gave the two main constituents of rosmarinic acid 185 
namely caffeic acid at m/z 179.0 and the 2-hydroxy derivative of hydrocaffeic acid at m/z 186 
197.0 as illustrated in Figure 3. Similar pattern of fragmentation of rosmarinic acid 187 
during CID analysis has been reported by several authors (17, 25, 26) in analyzing 188 
extracts of Lamiaceae spices.  189 
 190 
 Hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives 191 
The ESI-MS signals at m/z 169.01, m/z 197.04, m/z 167.04, m/z 153.02 and m/z 137.02 192 
were identified as gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid and 4-193 
hydroxybenzoic acid respectively by comparing their retention time and MS spectral data 194 
with those of an authentic standard. Accurate mass measurements further confirmed their 195 
elemental composition (Table 1). Upon fragmentation by CID gallic acid, vanillic acid, 196 
protocatechuic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid produced the ions at m/z 125.0, m/z 197 
123.0, m/z 109.0 and m/z 93.0 respectively due to loss of CO2 from their respective 198 
precursor ions. This pattern of fragmentation was characteristic feature of 199 
hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives like other phenolic acids. Syringic acid on the other 200 
hand first lost a water molecule generating a major fragment ion at m/z 179.0 followed by 201 
a loss of carbon dioxide producing the other fragment at m/z 135.0. A sugar conjugate of 202 
hydroxybenzoic acid eluting at 22.64 min showed [M-H]- ions of m/z 299.10. Accurate 203 
mass measurement suggested the molecular composition as that of hydroxybenzoic acid-204 
O-hexoside. Subsequent MS/MS experiment revealed the loss of hexose moiety 205 
producing deprotonated 4-hydroxybenzoic acid at m/z 137.0. All the hydroxybenzoic acid 206 
derivatives mentioned above were detected in all the Lamiaceae spices examined by ESI-207 
MS analyses (Table 1). 208 
 209 
Flavonoids 210 
Flavonoids constituted the largest number of polyphenols in the spices investigated in this 211 
study (Table 1). With the aid of reference standards and complemented by the accurate 212 
mass measurement data, eight flavonoids were identified in all the spices studied by LC-213 
MS. The eight flavonoids were apigenin, luteolin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-214 
glucoside, gallocatechin, phloridzin, quercetin and rutin. Furthermore, the fragmentation 215 
pattern of these flavonoids was similar to those described previously where the most 216 
common fragment lost was a water molecule and a glucose moiety in the two glucosides 217 
(26, 27).  218 
For the remaining nine flavonoids listed in Table 1 for which there were no ‘in-house’ 219 
standards, their identifications were based solely on accurate mass measurements and the 220 
MS/MS data (Table 1). Acacetin found in rosemary, oregano and basil; cirsimaritin and 221 
methyl apigenin found in all 5 spices; and isorhamnetin found in rosemary, sage and 222 
thyme were the only four non-sugar based flavonoids. They had a characteristic feature in 223 
the MS/MS experiment where the loss of one or more methyl groups was observed. 224 
Acacetin (m/z 283.1) eluting at 17.89 min, methyl apigenin (m/z 283.1) eluting at 20.69 225 
min and isorhamentin (m/z 315.0) eluting at 14.80 min lost one methyl group each 226 
producing m/z 268.0, m/z 268.0 and m/z 300.0 respectively while cirsimaritin (m/z 313.1) 227 
lost two consecutive methyl groups resulting fragment ions m/z 298.0 and m/z 283.1. 228 
Despite the fact that acacetin and methyl-apigenin are isomers differing only in the 229 
position of methyl group, they separated well in the reversed phase LC. Since acacetin is 230 
slightly polar than methyl-apigenin, it eluted earlier in the LC-separation.  Justesen (26) 231 
described similar fragmentation of acacetin in analyzing extracts from different herbs. 232 
Similar to our findings, Herrero et al. (17) have previously reported on cirsimaritin in 233 
rosemary extracts using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Parejo et al. (24), unlike our data, have noted 234 
three fragment ions from isorhamnetin, i.e. m/z 300, m/z 271 and m/z 255, in fennel 235 
extracts by ESI-MS/MS analysis. The difference could probably be due to different set of 236 
collision energy being used in the two different instruments.   237 
Glycosylated flavonoids constituted the bulk of the polyphenols in the spices. Hexose and 238 
rutinose conjugates of flavonoids were most commonly observed. The MS/MS 239 
experiments revealed that the [M-H]- ions at m/z 477.10 eluting at 9.85 min and m/z 240 
463.09 eluting at 4.83 min were isorhamnetin-3-O-hexoside and quercetin-3-O-hexoside 241 
respectively. Similar to the MS/MS data from apigenin-7-O-glucoside and luteolin-7-O-242 
glucoside, these hexosides also showed the loss of a hexose moiety (162 u). In addition to 243 
the fragment ion at m/z 315.0 corresponding to deprotonated molecular ion of 244 
isorhamnetin, the isorhamnetin-3-O-hexoside produced a fragment ion at m/z 300.0 245 
further confirming that the hexose derivative was that of isorhamnetin. As expected 246 
isorhamnetin-3-O-hexoside was only detected in the extracts of rosemary, sage and 247 
thyme of the five spices examined (Table 1). Similar approach and conclusions were 248 
made for quercetin-3-O-hexoside. The present study also identified two phenolic 249 
rutinosides, namely apigenin-7-O-rutinoside and luteolin-7-O-rutinoside apart from 250 
quercetin-7-O-rutinoside (commonly known as rutin) in all the spices examined (Table 251 
1). The product ion scan experiments of these compounds produced the intense fragment 252 
ions 308 u (dehydrated rutinose moiety) lower than the m/z values of the precursor ions. 253 
The presence of rutin in rosemary and oregano extract has been reported by 254 
Papageorgiou, et al. (28) using reversed phase HPLC. However, only one glucoronide 255 
derivrative of flavonoids could be detected in all the spices examined. This compound 256 
eluting at 12.15 min was identified as luteolin-3-O-glucoronide (Table 1). Subsequent 257 
CID of luteolin-3-O-glucoronide showed the loss of a glucoronic acid (m/z 176) and 258 
produced the predominant fragment at m/z 285.0 corresponding to deprotonated luteolin. 259 
Similar fragmentation of the compound was reported by Justesen (26) in analyzing thyme 260 
extracts.   261 
 262 
Phenolic terpenes and lignan 263 
There were 8 polyphenols detected in the spices examined that fall uder the phenolic 264 
terpenes and lignan category (Table 1). Three of them, thymol, carnosol and carnosic 265 
acid, were identified as they showed identical LC-MS characteristics as that of the 266 
standards. Thymol detected only in thyme when subjected to CID produced fragments at 267 
m/z 131.0 and m/z 120.0 corresponding to the loss of water and an ethyl [-CH2-CH3] 268 
group (29 u) from the precursor ion (m/z 149.09). Carnosol detected in all the spices and 269 
carnosic acid found only in rosemary, oregano and sage showed major fragment ions 270 
following a loss of carbon dioxide as seen in all the phenolic acids. Decarboxylated 271 
carnosic acid further fragmented producing m/z 244.2 ions due to dissociation of a propyl 272 
group (CH2CH2CH3). Methylated carnosic acid and methoxycarnosol were also identified 273 
in all the samples (Table 1).  Methyl carnosate (m/z 345.20) eluting at 22.68 min 274 
produced two major fragments: m/z 301.2 due to loss of carbondioxide molecule with 275 
further loss of methyl group producing m/z 286.2 ions. This fragmentation pattern was in 276 
agreement with that reported by Herrero et al., (2009) in analysing the phenolic 277 
antioxidant compounds of rosemary extracts. The methoxycarnosol (m/z 359.17) eluting 278 
at 22.70 min also generated two major fragments in the MS/MS experiment: m/z 329.2 279 
and m/z 285.2 corresponding to loss of a methoxy group and subsequent loss of 280 
carbondioxide molecule. Epirosmannol which has the same nominal mass as that of 281 
methyl carnosate eluted 4.75 min earlier than the methyl carnosate in the LC separation 282 
(Figure 1 and Table 1). In addition to difference in elution time, the accurate mass 283 
measurement distinguished epirosmannol (calculated m/z 345.1702, observed m/z 284 
345.1702) from methyl carnosate (calculated m/z 345.2066, observed m/z 345.2054). 285 
Furthermore the MS/MS data from epirosmannol, unlike methyl carnosate, showed the 286 
loss of water following decarboxylation. The last of the terpenes found in this study was 287 
rosmadial which had a unique fragmentation pathway compared to other terpenes 288 
described earlier. Rosmadial (m/z 343.20) lost two and three methylene groups from the 289 
precursor ions resulting fragment ions m/z 315.2 and m/z 300.2 respectively. There was 290 
only one phenolic lignan, namely medioresinol, identified in the extracts of all Lamiaceae 291 
spices analysed. 292 
 293 
Application of LC-ESI-MS/MS technique in the current study provided useful 294 
information to characterize 38 phenolic compounds in the extracts of five Lamiaceae 295 
spices. Fragments produced during CID analysis of the compounds mentioned above are 296 
the diagnostic features of these compounds which could be used to identify them in 297 
different extracts. Results of accurate mass measurements are another diagnostic feature 298 
of these compounds and proved useful to differentiate compounds with same nominal 299 
mass but dissimilar exact masses (Table 1). Equally mass spectrometry showed 300 
advantageous in identification of polyphenols for those that did not separate as different 301 
entities in the reversed phase column. Nonetheless, when isomeric polyphenols such as 302 
acacetin and methyl apigenin which posed challenge for MS, the LC was able to resolve 303 
the isomers. One inherent weakness of the low collision energy MS/MS studies was that 304 
it could not localise the position in the native phenolic ring that underwent modification. 305 
In such scenario, the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 306 
would be helpful. The NMR would also have the capability to reveal the identity of the 307 
compound responsible for the modification. As far as the authors are aware, there is no 308 
literature providing a comprehensive analysis of polyphenols in the extracts of Lamiaceae 309 
spices. Furthermore, of the 38 polyphenols identified, 20 compounds in rosmary, 26 310 
compounds in oregano, 23 compounds in sage, 24 compounds in basil and 20 compounds 311 
in thyme have been reported in the present study for the first time (Table 1).  In 312 
conclusion, the combination of accurate mass measurement to determine the elemental 313 
composition and the LC’s ability to separate isomeric compounds provided a powerful 314 
tool in identification of polyphenolic diversity in five species of Lamiaceae family even 315 
in the absence of standards. 316
