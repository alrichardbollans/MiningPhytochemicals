As células estão continuamente expostas a uma série de fatores que exercem estresse oxidativo
o qual gera várias patologias que estão relacionadas a fatores de senescência tais como doenças
coronárias, artrites reumática, e câncer. Para combater esse efeito, os organismos vivos desenvolveram
uma rede complexa de antioxidantes que agem contra essas espécies radicalares nocivas à vida. Com
o intuito de fazer uma bioprospecção de espécies vegetais da Mata Atlântica e Cerrados brasileiros
estabelecemos uma metodologia para detetar compostos com atividade antioxidante. A combinação
de CLAE a um detetor eletroquímico permitiu a detecção de micromoléculas antioxidantes nos
extratos brutos das folhas de Chimmarhis turbinata (DC). Foi possível detectar e identificar nas
matrizes naturais os compostos responsáveis após comparação com padrões isolados da mesma
espécie.
Living cells are continuously exposed to a variety of challenges that exert oxidative stress and are
directly related with senescence and the onset of various pathological conditions such as coronary
heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Nevertheless, living organisms have developed a
complex antioxidant network to counteract reactive species that are detrimental to life. With the aim
of bio-prospecting plant species from the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, we have established
a methodology to detect secondary antioxidant metabolites in crude extracts and fractions obtained
from plant species. Combining HPLC with an electrochemical detector allowed us to detect
micromolecules that showed antioxidant activities in Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) leaf extracts.
Comparison with purified flavonoid standards led us to identify the compounds in their natural
matrices giving valuable information on their antioxidant capacity.

Introduction
Oxygen-derived free radicals such as the superoxide
anion radical and hydroxyl radical are thought to be linked
to the onset of various pathological conditions such as
coronary heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.1-3
Living cells, including those of man, animals and plants,
are continuously exposed to a variety of challenges that
exert oxidative stress. These could stem from endogenous
sources through normal physiological processes such as
mitochondrial respiration. Alternatively, they could result
from exogenous sources such as exposure to pollutants
and ionizing irradiation.4,5
Oxidative stress arises in a biological system after an
increased exposure to oxidants, a decrease in the
antioxidant capacity of the system, or both. This is often
associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), including free radicals, which are strongly
implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases.6-8 Cells are
equipped with several defense systems, which act through
a variety of mechanisms.9 These can be categorized into
protection via enzymatic activities and protection through
low-molar mass antioxidants (LMMAs) .10
The LMMA family consist of many compounds, which
act as a direct chemical scavengers neutralizing ROS
components or indirectly through transition metal
chelation.11 LMMAs are small molecules that frequently
infiltrate cells, accumulate in specific compartments
associated with oxidative damage and then are regenerated
by the cell. In human tissues, cellular LMMAs are obtained
from various sources. Glutathione (GSH), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (reduced form), and carnosine12 are
synthesized by the cells; uric acid13 and bilirubin14 are
772 Castro-Gamboa et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
waste products of cellular metabolism, and ascorbic acid,
tocopherols and polyphenols are antioxidants obtained
from the diet.15
Flavonoids and phenolic acids are ubiquitous bioactive
compounds found in plant tissues.16 They can be arranged
in several structural classes including anthocyanins,
flavones, flavan-3-ols (catechins), flavonols and tannins.
These micromolecules share the same basic structure
consisting of two aromatic rings joined in a chroman
structure by a three-carbon unit: C6-C3-C6. Phenolic acids
in plant foods and beverages comprise mainly derivatives
of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids.17 The
diversity in structure and reactivity among different
flavonoids and phenolic acids are mainly due to variations
in the patterns of oxy-substituents on their aromatic rings.18
Both flavonoids and phenolic acids are closely
associated with the sensory attributes of fresh and processed
plant foods. However, increasing attention has been given
to these classes because of their potential antioxidant
activity that may exert cardioprotective effects in humans.19
Thus, it was shown that intake of flavonoids, especially
quercetin found in onions, tea and apples, was inversely
related to coronary heart disease mortality. Further, it has
been suggested that the high amount of flavonoids and
phenolic compounds consumed in red wine may explain
the reduced coronary heart disease mortality in certain
regions of France.20, 21
Evidence has shown that oxidation of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) leads to atherogenic reactions, and
hence increases coronary heart disease mortality.22, 23
Antioxidants that inhibit LDL oxidation may thus reduce
atherogenesis. Currently, there is no direct evidence that
flavonoids and phenolic acids reduce LDL oxidation in
vivo but several studies have shown that these phenolic
compounds have the capacity to reduce LDL oxidation in
vitro: micromolar concentrations of phenolic compounds
in wine and grape juice were thus demonstrated to inhibit
oxidation of human LDL in vitro.24
Several methods for measuring the total antioxidant
capacity of biological samples, including blood plasma,
body fluids and plant extracts, have been proposed and
reviewed.25-28 These are related to the capacity of a sample
to compete for and scavenge a specific ROS. They provide
useful information, which is thought sufficient for the
evaluation of the overall antioxidant profile of the
biological fluid, tissue homogenate, or plant extract.
Recently, electrochemical detection (ElCD) has given
good results for the detection of molecules with antioxidant
properties,29, 30 based on their electrochemical behavior.
Their on-line determination has been successfully
achieved through use of an ElCD, which is widely used as
a coupled detector in HPLC separations. With the aim of
bio-prospecting plant species from the Brazilian Cerrado,
Atlantic Forest and Amazon regions, we have established
a methodology to detect antioxidant molecules based on
HPLC-ElCD. To select the lead plant extracts, we did a
prior screening using the bleaching of β-carotene-TLC
autographic assay31 and also cyclic voltammetry32 for
detecting any electrochemical activity. One of the species
selected in this screening was Chimarrhis turbinata (DC)
(Rubiaceae).
This plant is widely spread from Central America and
the Caribbean through tropical South America, mostly
concentrated in the Amazon region. Their light and resistant
wood is used for crafting tools as oars, this usage being
related to the etymology of its popular name: “pau-de-
remo”. Rubiaceae species are well known for their
biological activities and medicinal uses, bearing
metabolites such as flavonoids and indole alkaloids, both
chemotypes known to have potential biological activities.
The latter are considered taxonomical markers of the
Cinchonoideae sub-family within Rubiaceae.33-35
Experimental
Instrumental
The analytical methodology was developed using a
VARIAN STAR 9090 ElCD (Rotterdam, Holland)
composed of a glassy carbon working electrode, an Ag/
AgCl reference electrode and an in situ Ag/AgCl electrode.
As a complementary detector a VARIAN PROSTAR 310
UV/Vis detector (Walnut Creek, CA, USA) set at 270 nm
was used. A Rheodyne injector (Coxati, CA), with a 20 µL
loop and a VARIAN 210 HPLC pump as solvent delivery
module were used. The determination of the optimal
potential to evaluate the crude extracts was obtained
through a hydrodynamic voltammogram. Separation of
the analytes was carried on a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA,
USA), ODS LUNA;  5 µ column (250 x 4.60 mm). The
separation did not require a buffer solution, but was greatly
improved by the use of acetic acid (Merck, Poole, UK)
(0.05% v/v). The isocratic phase was prepared by mixing
acetonitrile 15% v/v; (HPLC grade, Mallinckrodt, Paris,
KY, USA) with ultra pure water 85% v/v, obtained by
passing redistilled water through a Milli-Q system
(Millipore, Watford, UK). All the separations were carried
out at 30 °C a temperature achieved through an oven
coupled to the ElCD.
The extract from Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) leaves was
obtained through three distinct macerations of the dried
and powered material with EtOH:H2O (8:2). All solvents
773HPLC-ElCD: An Useful Tool for the Pursuit of Novel Analytical StrategiesVol. 14, No. 5, 2003
used for extractions were of analytical grade (Mallinckrodt,
Paris, Kentucky, USA). After concentration of the extract
using a vacuum rotatory evaporator (Büchi, Falwil,
Switzerland), the sample was then submitted to pre-
purification using a Sep-Pak (ODS) (Waters, Milford,
Massachusetts, USA) cartridge with elution using 100%
acetonitrile. The resulting filtered sample was injected into
the column for the detection of any electrochemically
active component.
Plant material
The leaves from Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) were
collected in “Reserva do Viro”, Belém - PA, Brazil in
February 2000 and the specimen was identified by Dr. Inês
Cordeiro. A voucher (number Cord-2367) was deposited
in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil.
Results and Discussion
Prior to the analysis, it was necessary to establish an
optimal potential for the analytes. Thus, solutions
(100 mgL-1) of catechin (1), rutin (2), chlorogenic acid
caffeoyl ester (3) previously isolated and identified from
C.turbinata (Figure 1) were prepared. Each standard
compound (20 µL) was injected at several working
electrode potentials ranging from –2.00 to 2.00 V and
chromatograms were recorded at 0.05 V intervals (Figure
2). The UV/Vis detector was set at 270 nm, which was the
best wavelength for the absorption of the flavonoids and
the C6-C3 derivatives used as standards.
From the analyses the optimal working potential was
determined to range between 0.80 V and 0.60 V. Thus the
analytical conditions for the crude extracts were improved,
aiming to enhance chromatographic resolution. Crude
extracts from C.turbinata leaves were injected mostly from
the ethyl acetate, methanol and aqueous phases. These are
known to be rich in flavonoids an other phenolic
metabolites that are usually electrochemically active.
Initially it was noted that most of the peaks were broad,
suggesting a possible keto-enolic equilibrium of the
analytes. We thus used a 0.05% (v/v) of acetic acid in
water, obtaining great enhancement in the peak profiles as
shown in Figure 3.
In the search of a better mobile phase methanol was
used but with little success when compared with
acetonitrile mixtures. In all chromatographic separations
the presence of a buffer solution was not required since we
obtained a good cell current and a steady base line for the
ElCD. The best chromatographic conditions obtained for
the crude extracts were mobile phase water:acetonitrile;
85:15 v/v, flow rate: 0.80 mL/min; 0% offset, digital filter
set at 0.1 s, range 5 mA and an oven temperature of 30 °C.
The identification of peaks was based on comparison of

retention times and co-injections of pure compounds
(Table 1).
Once the best chromatographic conditions were
established for the separation of the crude sample, we
compared the retention times of the electrochemically
active peaks with those shown by the standards (Figures 4,
5 and 6), with the presence of these micromolecules being
manifest in the matrices of the three crude extracts.
Conclusions
The proposed screening method using HPLC-ElCD is
useful for the detection of antioxidants because of its high
sensitivity and ease handling. The method may be
advantageous for the sensitive determination of
antioxidants in complex matrices. The detection limit of
the methodology depends directly on the ElCD sensitivity,

which in most cases range from mV to pV. In the analysis
of C. turbinata extracts the absence of a buffer solution to
stabilize the base line of the electrochemical detector is an
important factor, which certainly saves time in the
preparation and maintenance of the HPLC and the
electrochemical cell. An interesting application of this
method is the selection of plant extracts containing LMMA
antioxidant molecules for further phytochemical studies
and biological evaluation regarding anti-inflammatory,
anti-tumoral and other activities, as redox processes are
involved in the etiology of a number of pathologies.
