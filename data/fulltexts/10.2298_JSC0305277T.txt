Abstract: Five lignans with a 2,6-diaryl-3,7-dioxabicyclo3.3.0octane skeleton, epieude-
smin, kobusin, pinoresinol, fargesin and sesartemin, were isolated from the aerial parts and
roots of Achillea lingulata. Their structures were identified by comparison of their 1H-NMR
and MS data to those in the literature. Fargesin and pinoresinol have not been isolated previ-
ously from any species of the genus Achillea.
Keywords: Asteraceae, Achillea lingulata, lignans, epieudesmin, kobusin, pinoresinol, far-
gesin, sesartemin.
INTRODUCTION
Genus Achillea L. (family Asteraceae) comprises about 100 species.1 The aerial parts
of different species of the genus are widely used in folk medicine due to numerous medici-
nal properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antihemorrhoidal, stomachic, an-
tiseptic and emmenagogue.2–4
Despite the widespread occurrence of lignans in the plant kingdom, they have so far
been obtained from only three species of the genus Achillea: A. gypsicola,5 A. ptarmica6
and A. holesericea.7
Lignans are generally believed to be formed by the oxidative coupling of two
coniferyl alcohol units, followed by further modification processes. The biosynthetic reac-
tions are assumed to be enzyme-catalyzed since the majority of natural lignans are in an
optically active form.8
Lignans are known to possess a variety of biological activities: antitumor, antimitotic,
antiviral, as well as toxicity to fungi, insects and vertebrates, which make them interesting
for further explorations.9
In the course of our investigations of the chemical composition of wild-growing spe-
cies of the genus Achillea from Serbia and Montenegro, the aerial parts and roots of A.

lingulata Waldst. et Kit have been examined. This subcarpatian floral element can be
found throughout the highland regions of the Balkan peninsula (with the exception of
Greece) and Rumania.1 Secondary metabolites of A. lingulata, with exception of essential
oils,10 have not been studied before.
EXPERIMENTAL
General
1H (200 MHz) and 13C (50 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 2000 spectrometer
in CDCl3. Mass spectra were obtained on a Finnigan Mat 8230 (EI, 70 eV) and DCI (150 eV, isobutane). IR
spectra were measured in the form of transparent films on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR Spectrometer 1725 X. Silica
gel (0.063–0.200 mm) was used for column chromatography (CC). Silica gel G and silica gel F-254 were
used for analytical (0.25 mm) and preparative (0.75mm) thin layer chromatography (TLC).
Plant material
The Achillea lingulata was collected during the flowering season in July 1998, at Zekova Glava, moun-
tain Bjelasica, Montenegro. A voucher specimen (BEOU 15667) is deposited at the herbarium of the
Department of Botany, Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade.
Extraction and isolation
The aerial parts and roots were examined separately. The ground air-dried aerial parts (400 g) were ex-
tracted with petroleum ether-ether-MeOH (1 : 1 : 1; 3 1; 24 h; room temp.). The solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure and the obtained extract (19 g) was treated with MeOH (300 ml) in order to remove
long-chain hydrocarbons. The MeOH soluble part, obtained by filtration, was evaporated in vacuo to yield a
residue (16.9 g) in the form of a viscous brown oil. This was fractionated by silica gel dry-column flash
chromatography; the elution was started with petroleum ether and then the polarity was gradually increased
by addition of ether (to 100 %) and MeOH (to 30 %).
The fractions containing lignans (eluted with 80–100 % ether) were combined and chromatographed on
silica gel using toluene-ether-MeOH (7.5 : 2.0 : 0.5) as the eluent. Fractions (220  10 ml) were collected and
analysed by TLC and were subsequently combined into 12 fractions (F1-F12).
F4 was purified by preparative TLC (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 99.6 : 0.4) to afford kobusin (4, 0.8 mg).
Epieudesmin (1, 23 mg) was obtained from F6 by crystallization from ether–MeOH (1 : 1). F9 was
rechromatographed by CC on silica gel followed by preparative TLC (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 97 : 3) to yield
pinoresinol (3, 0.35 mg).
The powdered roots (54 g) were extracted with petroleum ether–ether–methanol (1 : 2 : 2). Evaporation
of the solvent in vacuo, yielded a crude extract (1.3 g) which was divided into five fractions by dry-column
flash chromatography on silica gel, using the following solvents: petroleum ether, CH2Cl2, ether, EtOAc,
MeOH (in portions of 200 ml). The combined fractions eluted with ether and EtOAc afforded a residue (300
mg), which was further divided into 200 fractions on silica gel CC (CH2Cl2–MeOH, 99.3 : 0.7). Fraction 170,
containing a mixture of lignans, was rechromatographed by silica gel CC (CCl4–ether–MeOH, 7.0 : 2.8 : 0.2)
to yield 50 fractions (F1-F50).
Fargesin (2, 1.5 mg) was obtained from F21, while 1 (4 mg) and sesartemin (5, 3.4 mg) were isolated
from F41 by prep. TLC (CCl4–ether–MeOH, 7.0 : 2.8 : 0.2). F29 contained an inseparable mixture of4 and5.
All lignans exhibited M+ ions in EIMS and (M+H)+ ions in DCIMS corresponding to their molecular
formulas. The IR and 1H-NMR data of 1–5 and the 13C-NMR data of 1were identical to those published.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As described in the Experimental section, the combination of various chro-
matographic techniques (dry-column flash chromatography, silica gel CC and
prep. TLC) applied to the extracts of the aerial parts of Achillea lingulata afforded
278 TRIFUNOVI] et al.
three bisepoxylignans, epiudesmin5,7,11,12 (1), pinoresinol13 (3) and kobusin7,14
(4). A similar procedure applied to the extract of the roots revealed four lignans, 1,
4, fargesin11,12 (2) and sesartemin7,12 (5). All the isolated compounds were identi-
fied by comparison of their spectra to those published in the literature.
Whereas 2 and 3 have never been isolated previously from species of this genus,
compounds 1, 4 and 5 were found in the aerial parts of Achillea holosericea collected
on the mountain Parnitha in Attiki (Greece).7 Lignan 1was also detected previously in
the aerial parts of Achillea gypsicola from central Turkey.5
The ability of bisepoxylignans to influence enzyme activity has been studied before.
They are effective inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterase, especially lignans containing a
guaiacyl group in their structure (e.g.,3which was very active).9 Due to their inhibitor effi-
ciency on polysubstrate mono-oxygenases, some of them, e.g., the diastereomer of 5
(diasesartemin) showed activity towards insects such as the European corn borer, Ostrania
nubilalis.15 Kobusin (4) inhibited the growth of silkworm larvae (Bombyx mori) while

some others showed efficiency in enhancing the toxicity of a wide variety of insecticides.9
In addition, 2 exhibited platelet activating factor antagonist activity which is important be-
cause PAF was identified as a potent phospholipid mediator which may be involved in var-
ious inflammatory, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.16
