abstract
Chicory (Cichorium intybus) has been shown to induce enzymes of pharmacokinetic relevance (cyto-
chrome P450; CYP). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of selected secondary plant
metabolites with a global extract of chicory root, on the expression of hepatic CYP mRNA (1A2, 2A19,
2C33, 2D25, 2E1 and 3A29), using primary porcine hepatocytes. Of the tested secondary plant metabo-
lites, artemisinin, scoparone, lactucin and esculetin all induced increased expression of speciﬁc CYPs,
while esculin showed no effect. In contrast, a global extract of chicory root decreased the expression of
CYP1A2, 2C33, 2D25 and 3A29 at high concentrations. The results suggest that puriﬁed secondary metab-
olites from chicory affect CYP expression and thereby might affect detoxiﬁcation in general, and that glo-
bal extracts of plants can have effects different from individual components.

1. Introduction
Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) is an important source of the
polysaccharide inulin and has been shown to possess a wide range
of pharmacological properties, including hepato-protective, anti-
inﬂammatory, anti-malarial and anti-diabetic effects (Ahmed, Al-
Howiriny, & Siddiqui, 2003; Bais & Ravishankar, 2001; Cavin
et al., 2005; Tousch et al., 2008). Additionally, research has shown
that chicory feeding increased the expression and activity of hepa-
tic xenobiotica (drugs, antibiotics) metabolizing enzymes in pigs
(Rasmussen, Zamaratskaia, & Ekstrand, 2011a). The aerial parts of
the plant are often consumed as part of salads, while the roots
are processed and used as coffee substitutes or food ingredients.
Metabolism of the diverse classes of xenobiotics is usually di-
vided into two phases: phase I, oxidative modiﬁcation, and phase
II, derivatisation. Phase I is often catalysed by enzymes belonging
to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. Hence, CYPs are exten-
sively studied for their involvement in drug metabolism and detox-
iﬁcation (Guengerich, 2007). Proteomic analysis of the porcine liver
has determined that the most abundant CYP families are CYP1A,
2A, 2C, 2D, 2E and 3A (Achour, Barber, & Rostami-Hodjegan,
2011). Apart from their impact on drug metabolism, porcine CYPs
are also studied for their ability to metabolize skatole. The com-
pound skatole is a metabolite of tryptophan produced in the gut;
after absorption to the blood stream it is metabolized in the liver
by CYPs. If the hepatic clearance of skatole is insufﬁcient, it will
accumulate in the adipose tissue of the pig. High concentrations
of skatole in fat are associated with poor meat quality of sexually
mature male pigs, a phenomenon known as boar taint. Several
different CYPs have been shown to catabolise skatole (Matal,
Matuskova, Tunkova, Anzenbacherova, & Anzenbacher, 2009;
Terner, Gilmore, Lou, & Squires, 2006; Wiercinska, Lou, & Squires,
2012).
Differences in CYP expression and activity between individuals
have been observed and are often explained by the genetic proﬁle
of the individual, but other factors are also important, e.g., gender
and age. Moreover, there is growing evidence that bioactive
compounds, e.g., secondary plant metabolites, affect liver function
and CYP activity. It has been shown that St. John’s wort, Ginkgo bi-
loba, wormwood (Artemisia), common sage (Salvia) and chicory
(Cichorium) inﬂuence the expression and/or activity of hepatic
CYPs (Chang, 2009; Chang & Waxman, 2006; Hellum, Hu, & Nilsen,
2009; Rasmussen, Zamaratskaia, Andersen, & Ekstrand, 2012;
Rasmussen et al., 2011a). Moreover, the secondary plant metabo-
lites, artemisinin and scoparone (from wormwood), have been
shown to possess pharmacological properties (Burk et al., 2005;
Huang, Zhang, & Moore, 2004). Chicory root has been shown to
contain numerous secondary metabolites, e.g., the sesquiterpene

Ravishankar, 2001). Thus, knowledge about the impact of plants
(used for consumption) on hepatic CYP expression/activity is very
important due to potential herb–drug interactions. The aim of this
study was to investigate the effects of selected secondary plant
metabolites from chicory on porcine CYP mRNA expression
in vitro and compare that to the effects of secondary plant metab-
olites from wormwood (Artemisia).
The expression of CYPs is generally believed to be regulated by
xenobiotic receptors (XR), such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X
receptor (PXR), regulating CYP1A, 2A and 3A expression, respec-
tively. However, extensive cross-talk between receptors does take
place (reviewed by Pascussi et al. (2008)). By treating hepatocytes
with standard activators of these receptors and selected plant sec-
ondary metabolites, the potential for CYP mRNA induction was
investigated. The effect of a global chicory root extract was com-
pared to that of the standard CYP inducers and the secondary plant
metabolites.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ethical and animal welfare aspects
The pigs used for hepatocyte isolation were treated in accor-
dance with the guidelines from the Danish Inspectorate of Animal
Experimentation.
2.2. Isolation of porcine hepatocytes
Five female cross-bred (Landrace   Yorkshire sire and Duroc
boar) piglets (11.1 ± 0.5 kg) were used in this study. The pigs were
killed with a bolt pistol, followed by immediate exsanguination,
before the liver (weight 200–250 g) was removed and transported
on ice to the laboratory. Time from killing to the arrival of the liver
at the laboratory was not more than 10 min. Hepatocytes were iso-
lated by a protocol adopted from Monshouwer, Witkamp, Nijmei-
jer, Van Amsterdam, and Van Miert (1996) and Seglen (1972). After
arrival at the laboratory, the liver was transferred to a laminar
ﬂow-bench and cannulated with a tube in the large central vein.
The liver was then perfused with 1 l of basis-buffer (Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline without Ca
2+ and Mg
2+ (DPBS; Invitro-
gen) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1% glucose; saturated with
O2; pH 7.4) treated with 1 mM EGTA, followed by perfusion with
1 l of basis-buffer. Afterwards 0.75 l of basis-buffer containing
4.75 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% collagenase (Type II; Worthington,
USA) was perfused under recirculation for 15 min. The liver was
then cut into small pieces with a scalpel and transferred to a bottle
containing basis-buffer with 4.75 mM CaCl2 and 0.025%
collagenase and incubated under gentle stirring for 15 min. To
the resulting cell suspension. ice-cold basis-buffer with 2% BSA
(1:1) was added, and it was then ﬁltered through nylon mesh with
a mesh size of 200 lm
2, followed by ﬁltering through nylon mesh
with a mesh size of 50 lm
2. Cells were then isolated by a 5 min
centrifugation at 100g (4 C) and washed in William E medium
(WME; Invitrogen) containing 10% (volume/volume) foetal calf
serum (FCS; Sigma). After isolation of the cells, they were seeded
directly or cryopreserved according to the procedure described
below.
2.3. Cell number, viability, cryopreservation and thawing of
hepatocytes
Cell number was evaluated by counting the cells in a haemocy-
tometer, combined with light microscopy. Cell viability was
estimated by their ability to exclude trypan blue, regarding cells
not able to exclude trypan blue as dead.
The isolated cells were diluted in WME with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-
glutamine (Sigma) and 1 lM insulin (Sigma), obtaining a ﬁnal den-
sity of 10
7 cells/ml. DMSO was slowly added to the cell suspension
reaching a ﬁnal concentration of 10% (v/v). Afterwards 1.0 ml of
cell suspension was put in cryotubes (NUNC) and placed in propa-
nol-containing boxes and frozen at  80 C freezer overnight. The
next day, tubes were transferred to a tank containing liquid
nitrogen.
Thawing was done by heating the tubes in a 37 C water bath
and, when the content was thawed, it was transferred to 50 ml
tubes with WME containing 10% FCS (37 C). The cells were then
sedimented by centrifugation at 100g for 5 min (37 C).
2.4. Culturing of hepatocytes and effect of time in culture
For evaluation of the effect of cryopreservation and time in cul-
ture, either freshly isolated or cryopreserved hepatocytes were
suspended in WME with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/
ml of penicillin (Sigma), 100 lg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma),
20lg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), 2.5 lg/ml of ampotericin B (Sigma)
and 1 lM insulin. 100,000 cells/cm
2 were seeded into collagen
(Type I, BD Biosciences)-coated wells (6 well plates; NUNC) and
subjected to 37 C and 5% CO2 in an incubator. 24 h after seeding,
dead and unattached cells were removed by washing the wells
with DPBS (Ca
2+,M g
2+;3 7C) and fresh medium was added. This
time point was regarded as day 1. Medium was renewed every
24 h and samples collected equivalent to days 2, 3, 6 and 7. Due
to low attachment of the cryopreserved hepatocytes isolated from
one pig (Table 1; Pig B), a Percoll puriﬁcation (Kreamer et al., 1986)
was performed before seeding.
2.5. Induction
To test the functionality of the isolated hepatocytes we deter-
mined their response to standard CYP inducers. We used 100 lM
b-naphthoﬂavone (Sigma), 100 lM CITCO (6-(4-chlorophenyl)imi-
dazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)
oxime; Sigma), 50 lM dexamethasone (Sigma) and 5 nM TCPOBOP
(1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; Sigma) dissolved in
DMSO, giving a ﬁnal concentration in the media of 0.1% DMSO.
Likewise, 1–100 lM artemisinin (Mediplantex, Hanoi, Vietnam),
lactucin (Extrasynthese, France), esculin (6,7-dehydroxycoumarin;
Sigma), esculetin (Sigma) and 10–100 lM scoparone (6,7-dimeth-
oxycoumarin; Sigma) were dissolved in DMSO, giving a ﬁnal con-
centration of 0.1% DMSO in the media.
A crude extract of dried chicory root was made by mixing (1:3
w/v) dried chicory root with 96% methanol. After 24 h of
extraction, the extract was ﬁltered and the methanol removed un-
der vacuum, resulting in a 50 times reduction in volume. The ﬁnal

256 M.K. Rasmussen et al./Food Chemistry 146 (2014) 255–263extract was given an arbitrary concentration of 100,000 units. For
all added concentrations of extract, methanol was added to the
media, giving a ﬁnal concentration of methanol at 0.1%.
Cryopreserved hepatocytes were seeded at a density of
100,000 cells/cm
2 into 12 well collagen-coated plastic plates. The
cells were seeded in WME with 5% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 unit/ml of penicillin, 100 lg/ml of streptomycin, 20lg/ml of
gentamicin, 2.5 lg/ml ampotericin B and 1 lM insulin. After 24 h
of attachment, the wells were washed with DPBS and fresh med-
ium, with or without inducers/extract, was added for another
24 h before the cells were lysed.
The control samples were treated with either 0.1% DMSO or
methanol. In preliminary experiments, it was shown that DMSO
and methanol, at these concentrations, did not affect the CYP
mRNA expression (data not shown). All treatments were analysed
in duplicate for each cell isolate.
2.6. Quantitative PCR
RNA isolation and reverse transcription were done using com-
mercially available kits. Brieﬂy, total RNA was isolated by lysing
the cell in the wells with RLT-buffer (WVR, Herlev, Denmark) and
running the lysate on a Spin column according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions (Rnasey Mini Kit, WVR, Herlev, Denmark).
Equal volumes of RNA were converted to cDNA using SuperScript
II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase and Oligo(dt)12–18 Primer (Invit-
rogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tion. Primers and probes for CYP1A2, 2A19, 2E1 and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are given
in Rasmussen, Zamaratskaia, and Ekstrand (2011b), while CYP3A29
is given in Nannelli et al. (2010). For determination of CYP2C33, we
used forward primer, reverse primer and TaqMan probes with the
following sequences (50–30): TGGGAATCTGATGCAACTTAACC, AA-
CAGGGCCGTACTGTTTGG and AAGGACATCCCTGCGTCTCTTTC-
CAAGTT, respectively. For determination of CYP2D25, the
corresponding sequences were: TTGGAAGGACTGAAGGAGGAAGT,
CCCGGGATATGCCTGAGAA and CCTCATGCGCCAGGTGCTGGA.
Primers and probes were designed with Primer Express version 2
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), using porcine speciﬁc
genomic DNA sequences (www.ensembl.org/Sus_scrofa/Info/In-
dex). The samples were analysed in duplicate in 348 well plates,
using an ABI 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosys-
tems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) under the following conditions: 50 C for
2 min, 95 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and
60 C for 1 min.
Relative mRNA expression was calculated by relating threshold
cycles to a standard curve obtained by running a serial dilution of a
cDNA sample. Relative mRNA expression was normalised against
the mRNA expression of GAPDH. The average of control samples
was arbitrarily set to 1. The obtained Ct-values for GAPDH were
not signiﬁcantly affected by any of the treatments.
2.7. Statistical analysis
To evaluate the effect of cryopreservation and time in culture on
CYP mRNA expression, two-way ANOVA was used, followed by Tu-
key’s post hoc test to identify differences in CYP mRNA expression.
The effect of inducers and secondary plant metabolites was evalu-
ated by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. To eval-
uate the effect of the chicory root extract compared to the control
samples, the Student’s t-test with Bonferroni’s correction was used
(a corrected p-level of p < 0.0083 was regarded as signiﬁcant).
All statistical tests were done using R (version 2.11.0).
3. Results
3.1. Isolation of hepatocytes
The total yield of hepatocytes was between 2   10
8 and 5   10
9
cells. When comparing the morphology of freshly isolated and
cryopreserved hepatocytes, no differences were seen, whereas
the viability before seeding was lowered by cryopreservation (on
average from 88% to 73%, p < 0.01, see Table 1).
3.2. CYP mRNA expression in hepatocytes; effect of time on culture
For CYP1A2, 2A19, 2D25 and 2E1, there was a signiﬁcant de-
crease in mRNA expression on day 2 in culture compared to day
1( Fig. 1). This reduction was maintained for the rest of the period.
For CYP2C33 and 3A29, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
mRNA expression between the days in culture. However, for these
CYPs, large variations between the cell isolates were observed. For
all CYPs investigated, no differences in mRNA expression between
freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes, in relation to their
time in culture, were observed.
3.3. Induction of CYP mRNA
To test the potential of the model to modify mRNA expression
of the investigated CYPs, the hepatocytes were treated with stan-
dard activators of the receptors regulating gene expression. The
used inducers were 100 lM b-naphthoﬂavone (Fig. 2A), 100 lM
CITCO (Fig. 2B), 50 lM dexamethasone (Fig. 2C) or 5 nM TCPOBOP
(Fig. 2D). Treating hepatocytes with b-naphthoﬂavone signiﬁcantly
increased the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 5.1-fold compared to
control. Likewise, the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 was signiﬁ-
cantly larger than the expression of all other investigated CYP iso-
forms. Treatment of hepatocytes with CITCO signiﬁcantly
increased the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 4.0-fold compared with
the control. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 was sig-
niﬁcantly larger than for all other investigated CYP isoforms. In the
dexamethasone-treated hepatocytes, mRNA expression of CYP1A2
and 3A was signiﬁcantly increased, 4.9- and 5.3-fold, respectively,
compared with the control, while the 4.3-fold increase in CYP2C33
expression almost reached signiﬁcance (p = 0.054). There was no
effect on CYP mRNA expression of treating hepatocytes with TCPO-
BOP (ANOVA, p > 0.05).
3.4. Secondary plant metabolites from chicory and wormwood, and
chicory root extract
Treatment of hepatocytes with artemisinin signiﬁcantly in-
creased the mRNA expression of CYP1A2, 2C33, 2D25 and 3A29,
up to 3.5-, 2.0-, 1.5-, and 3.4-fold, respectively, compared with
the control (Fig. 3A). Scoparone signiﬁcantly increased the mRNA
expression of CYP1A2 and 2D25, up to 4.3- and 1.8-fold, respec-
tively, compared with the control (Fig. 3B). Apart from that, no
other effects on CYP mRNA expression were observed.
For the chicory secondary metabolite, lactucin increased the
mRNA expression of CYP2A19, 2D25 and 2E1, up to 2.6-, 2.0- and
3.1-fold, respectively, compared with the control (Fig. 3C). Escule-
tin increased the CYP1A2 mRNA expression up to 2.2-fold (Fig. 3D)
while the expression of the other investigated CYP isoforms re-
mained unchanged. Esculin showed no effect on CYP mRNA
expression (Fig. 3E).
The extract of chicory decreased the mRNA expression of
CYP1A2 when administered at the three highest concentrations
(Fig. 4A). Moreover, chicory extract also decreased the mRNA
expression of CYP2C33, 2D25 and 3A29 when administered at
M.K. Rasmussen et al./Food Chemistry 146 (2014) 255–263 257the highest concentration (Fig. 4C, D and F). No effect of the chicory
root extract was found on CYP2A19 and 2E1 expression.
4. Discussion
The aim of the present study was to use primary hepatocytes
isolated from pigs to investigate regulation of CYP mRNA expres-
sion by treatment with selected secondary plant metabolites. In or-
der to validate the hepatocyte model, the effects of time in culture
and standard CYP inducers on CYP expression were investigated.
The major ﬁndings were that 1) mRNA expression of the
investigated CYPs with time in culture was not affected by cryo-
preservation; 2) treatment with standard CYP inducers and se-
lected secondary plant metabolites increased CYP expression
whereas 3) a global chicory root extract lowered the expression
of some of the investigated CYPs, but not all.
Several studies have investigated the effect of time in culture on
overall and speciﬁc CYP protein expression and activity in porcine
hepatocytes (Gillberg, Skaanild, & Friis, 2006; Keatch, Nelson, Ma-
son, Hayes, & Plevris, 2002; Koebe, Mueller-Hoecker, Koebe, &
Schildberg, 1995; Loven, Olsen, Friis, & Andersen, 2005; Monshou-
wer, van’t Klooster, Nijmeijer, Witkamp, & van Miert, 1998;

CYP1A2, (B) 2A19, (C) 2C33, (D) 2D25, (E) 2E1 and (F) 3A29 was determined on days 1 (24 h after seeding), 2, 3, 6 and 7 in culture. Data are means ± SEM.
258 M.K. Rasmussen et al./Food Chemistry 146 (2014) 255–263Skaanild & Friis, 2000; Zhou, Tokiwa, Kano, & Kodama, 1998). How-
ever, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to investigate the ef-
fect of time in culture on porcine CYP mRNA expression, while the
studies mentioned above have all investigated the protein expres-
sion or activity. In the present study, we showed that compared to
day 1 after seeding, the mRNA expression of CYP1A2, 2A19, 2D25,
2E1 was reduced by approximately 90% after day 2 in culture. Fol-
lowing the next 5 days in culture, the mRNA expression remained
stable at a low level compared to day 1. The mRNA expression of
CYP2C33 and 3A29 was not changed by time in culture. These ﬁnd-
ings are in accordance with previous results on CYP activity (Gill-
berg et al., 2006; Loven et al., 2005; Skaanild & Friis, 2008),
showing that, in porcine hepatocytes, the CYP2A-dependent activ-
ity is reduced by up to 80% during the ﬁrst day in culture. Addition-
ally, the study by Skaanild and Friis (2000) showed a concurrent
reduction in CYP2A-dependent activity and protein expression.
Moreover, it has been shown that CYP1A-dependent activity de-
creases with time in culture (Koebe et al., 1995; Zhou et al.,
1998), while CYP2E1 protein expression is not changed within
24 h after seeding (Doran, Whittington, Wood, & McGivan, 2002).
As the present study showed that mRNA expression of CYP1A2
and 2A19 is reduced, it could be suggested that the reduction in
CYP-dependent activity is caused by a reduction of the transcrip-
tional level. The unchanged expression of CYP3A29 mRNA found
in the present study is in accordance with Gillberg et al. (2006)
and Skaanild and Friis (2000), that showed constant protein
expression and CYP3A-dependent activity for up to 75 h of cultur-
ing. However, other studies have shown that both increased (Loven
et al., 2005) and decreased (Monshouwer et al., 1998) CYP3A-
dependent activity. Taken together, the present ﬁndings suggest
that the reduction of CYP protein expression and activity, found
with time in culture, is due to reduced mRNA expression. In the
present study we showed that, for none of the investigated CYPs,
were there differences between time-dependent CYP mRNA
expression in freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes. This
suggests that cryopreserved hepatocytes can be used to study CYP
mRNA expression.
To test the ability and the magnitude by which the hepatocytes
can regulate CYP mRNA, we treated them with standard inducers.
b-Naphthoﬂavone and dexamethasone are commonly used to acti-
vate the AhR and PXR, respectively, while CITCO and TCPOBOP are
used to activate CAR. However, as supported by the current results,
the single inducer can activate other XRs, either directly or indi-
rectly, via cross-talk or via their metabolites. In the present study,
b-naphthoﬂavone proved to be very speciﬁc in inducing an in-
crease only in CYP1A2 mRNA expression, probably by activating
the AhR. Porcine CYP1A induction by b-naphthoﬂavone has been
shown previously both in vivo (Messina, Nannelli, Fiorio, Longo,
& Gervasi, 2009; Nannelli et al., 2009) and in vitro (Monshouwer
et al., 1998). TCPOBOP has previously, as in the current study, been

in porcine hepatocytes, in contrast to murine hepatocytes. More-
over, the study by Gillberg et al. (2006) showed that CITCO induced
CYP2A-dependent activity. Surprisingly, our study showed no
changes in CYP2A19 mRNA in hepatocytes treated with CITCO,
while an increase in CYP1A2 mRNA expression was observed. This
discrepancy between the two studies can be explained by the dif-
ferent investigated response, i.e., mRNA expression vs. enzyme
activity. Dexamethasone has previously been shown to increase
CYP3A in porcine hepatocytes (Monshouwer et al., 1998). In the
current study, dexamethasone induced CYP3A29 and 1A2 mRNA
expression, while the observed increase in 2C33 almost reached
signiﬁcant levels (p = 0.054). This result is supported by studies
using human hepatocytes, showing that dexamethasone treatment
increased CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP1A1 (Lai, Wong, & Wong, 2004;
Pascussi, Gerbal-Chaloin, Fabre, Maurel, & Vilarem, 2000). This sug-
gests that dexamethasone has a complex mode of action in relation
to XR activation and gene regulation. Taken together, the results

260 M.K. Rasmussen et al./Food Chemistry 146 (2014) 255–263show that, even though CYP expression is suppressed with time in
culture, the hepatocytes are still able to increase CYP mRNA, by at
least 5-fold, when treated with XR activators.
To investigate the potential of inducing CYPs with secondary
plant metabolites, we treated hepatocytes with a sesquiterpene
lactone, artemisinin, and a coumarin derivative, scoparone. Arte-
misinin increased CYP1A2 and 3A29 mRNA expression by up to
3.5 times, while CYP2C33 and 2D25 mRNA expression was
increased up to 2 times. This suggests that artemisinin simulta-
neously activates AhR, CAR and PXR. This is further supported by
a study using a reporter gene assay, which showed that artemisinin
activates human CAR and PXR, as well as induces CYP3A4 and 2C19
mRNA expression in human hepatocytes (Burk et al., 2005).
Simonsson et al. (2006) also found that artemisinin activated the
human CAR and induced a weak but reproducible increase in
CYP1A2 mRNA in mice treated with artemisinin for 4 days. Our

⁄Signiﬁcantly different from control samples (no chicory extract). Signiﬁcance was
evaluated using Student’s t-test with Bonferroni’s correction.
M.K. Rasmussen et al./Food Chemistry 146 (2014) 255–263 261results show that scoparone treatment increased the mRNA
expression of CYP1A2 and 2D25, suggesting an activation of both
AhR and CAR. Previous studies, using human and mice hepatocytes,
have shown that scoparone can induce CYP2B6 and CYP2B10
mRNA expression by activating CAR (Huang et al., 2004; Yang,
Yang, Shi, Deng, & Yan, 2011).
It is still not known if the secondary plant metabolites found in
chicory (lactucin, esculetin and esculin) are able to modify the
expression of hepatic CYP mRNA. In the present study we showed
that the sesquiterpene lactone, lactucin, and the coumarin escule-
tin both induce CYP expression. Lactucin increased the expression
of CYP2A19, 2D25 and 2E1. Expression of these CYPs is expected to
be controlled by CAR. This suggests that lactucin can activate CAR.
Esculetin might activate AhR, due to the observed increase of
CYP1A2 mRNA. The esculetin metabolite, esculin, did not affect
the mRNA expression of any of the investigated CYP isoforms.
Thus, previously shown effects of feeding chicory root can be ex-
plained by the presence of chicory secondary metabolites activat-
ing XRs and inducing CYP expression (Rasmussen et al., 2011a).
In the group of pigs which had been given 10% dried chicory root
in their feed for the last 16 days before slaughter, there was up
to a 9-fold increase in CYP1A2 and 2A19 mRNA and a small in-
crease in CYP2E1 mRNA. Correspondingly, there was a subsequent
increase in CYP1A2 and 2A19 protein expression and activity. Sur-
prisingly, the effects of the global chicory root extract on hepatic
CYP mRNA expression found in the present study are not consis-
tent either with our previous in vivo results (Rasmussen et al.,
2011a) or some of our present results for individual secondary
metabolites from chicory. However, using global plant extracts,
in in vitro models introduces some biases. Due to the reported
presence of high amounts of sesquiterpene lactones in a methano-
lic extract of chicory root (Cavin et al., 2005), methanol was chosen
as solvent. This, however, excludes compounds not easily soluble
in methanol, which might possess CYP-inducing properties. An-
other explanation is in vivo modiﬁcation (e.g., in the gastrointesti-
nal tract) of the chicory compounds during absorption, potentially
making them ligands for the CYP-regulating receptors. Likewise,
more complex events, e.g., changes in hormone concentration
caused by chicory, can also affect CYP expression. This is supported
by previous studies showing decrease in androstenone levels with
chicory feeding (Byrne, Thamsborg, & Hansen, 2008; Rasmussen,
Brunius, Zamaratskaia, & Ekstrand, 2012).
It is noteworthy that the same CYP isoforms that were up-reg-
ulated in the dexamethasone- and artemisinin-treated hepato-
cytes, were down-regulated by high concentrations of the global
chicory extract. This may suggest that these CYPs have a common
mechanism for regulation and that the chicory extract acts as an
inverse agonist for the transcription factors for these CYPs.
In conclusion, the results show that puriﬁed secondary plant
metabolites, from e.g. chicory, can increase the expression of CYP
mRNA in porcine hepatocytes. In contrast, a global extract of chic-
ory root decreased the expression of several CYP isoforms.
