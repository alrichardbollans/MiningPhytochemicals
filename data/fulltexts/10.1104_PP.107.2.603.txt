An important aspect of the interaction of Pseudomonas syringae 
pv syringae with plant hosts i s  the perception of plant signal mol- 
ecules that regulate expression of genes, such as syrll, required for 
synthesis of the phytotoxin, syringomycin. In  this study, the leaves 
of sweet cherry (Prunus avium 1.) were analyzed to determine the 
nature of the syrB-inducing activity associated with tissues of a 
susceptible host. Crude leaf extracts yielded high amounts of total 
signal activity of more than 12,000 units g-’ (fresh weight) based on 
activation of a syr6-lacZ fusion in strain B3AR132. l h e  signal 
activity was fractionated by C,, reversed-phase high-performance 
liquid chromatography and found to be composed of phenolic 
glycosides, which were resolved in  three regions of the high-per- 
formance liquid chromatography profile, and sugars, which eluted 
with the void volume. Two flavonol glycosides, quercetin 3-rutino- 
syl-4’-glucoside and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside, and a fla- 
vanone glucoside, dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside, were identified. 
l h e  flavonoid glycosides displayed similar specific signal activities 
and were comparable in signal activity to arbutin, a phenyl p-glu- 
coside, giving rise to between 120 and 160 units of /3-galactosidase 
activity at 10 p ~ .  Although o-fructose exhibits intrinsic low leve1 
syrll-inducing signal activity, o-fructose enhanced by about 10-fold 
the signal activities of the flavonoid glycosides at low concentra- 
tions (e.g. 10 PM). This demonstrates that flavonoid glycosides, 
which represent a new class of phenolic plant signals sensed by P. 
s. syringae, are in  sufficient quantities in the leaves of P. avium to 
activate phytotoxin synthesis. 
Bacteria commonly detect in the plant environment spe- 
cific phenolic compounds that serve as signals in regulat- 
ing expression of genes critica1 to phytopathogenesis (Pe- 
ters and Verma, 1990). This was first observed for 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which senses in wounded tissues

a structurally diverse group of plant phenolic compounds 
(Stachel et al., 1985b). Perception of phenolic signal mole- 
cules leads to transcriptional activation of virulence (vir) 
genes necessary for the transfer of T-DNA to host cells and 
formation of crown galls. The types of phenolic com- 
pounds reported to have signal activity include certain 
acetophenones (e.g. acetosyringone), monolignols, chal- 
cones, and flavonoids (Spencer and Towers, 1988; Zerback 
et al., 1989; Duban et al., 1993). In the rhizobia, specific 
plant flavonoids were discovered to activate nodulation 
(nod) genes essential for establishment of symbiosis (Peters 
et al., 1986). Relatively low flavonoid concentrations rang- 
ing from 0.1 to 10 PM are necessary for activation of nod 
genes in Rhizobium (Firmin et al., 1986). In comparison, 
higher concentrations of phenolic inducers ranging from 10 
to 500 PM are required for activation of vir genes in 
Agrobacterium (Melchers et al., 1989). This is ameliorated by 
a second class of vir-inducing compounds composed of 
simple pyranose sugars that markedly enhance by 60- to 
200-fold the activities of low concentrations of phenolic 
signal molecules such as acetosyringone (Ankenbauer and 
Nester, 1990; Cangelosi et al., 1990; Shimoda et al., 1990). 
It recently was established that phytotoxin production by 
Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae is modulated by the per- 
ception of specific plant metabolites (Mo and Gross, 1991b; 
Quigley and Gross, 1994). Certain phenolic 0-glucosides, 
such as arbutin, serve as signals that induce production of 
syringomycin, a cyclic lipodepsinonapeptide toxin that 
causes necrotic symptoms in host plants (Segre et al., 1989; 
Takemoto, 1992). In addition, the syrB gene, which is con- 
served in toxigenic strains of P. s. syringae and is predicted 
to encode a synthetase (Quigley and Gross, 1994; J.-H. 
Zhang, N.B. Quigley, and D.C. Gross, unpublished data), is 
activated by phenolic signal compounds. This was mea- 
sured as induction of P-galactosidase activity resulting 
from a transcriptional fusion between syrB and a promot- 
erless luc operon as a reporter of gene activity (Mo and 
Gross, 1991a, 1991b). In a survey of 34 plant phenolic 
compounds for syrB-inducing activity, which included rep- 
resentative vir- or nod-inducing phenolics, only certain phe-

nolic glucosides exhibited syrB-inducing activity (Mo and 
Gross, 1991b). The P-glucosidic linkages in arbutin, phenyl- 
P-D-glucopyranoside, salicin, and esculin were concluded 
to be crucial to activity based on a lack of activity for their 
respective phenolic aglycone derivatives. In addition, a few 
mono- and disaccharides common to plant tissues substan- 
tially enhanced the syrB-inducing activity of phenolic sig- 
nals, and this was most noticeable at low concentrations of 
phenolic glucoside (i.e. 1 to 10 p ~ ) .  Suc and D-Fru were the 
most active enhancers of phenolic signal activity and also 
exhibited intrinsic low-leve1 signal activity yielding about 
100 p-galactosidase units of syrB-lacZ activity in the ab- 
sence of the phenolic inducer. The influence of signal- 
mediated induction of phytotoxin production by P. s. sy- 
ringue was emphasized by the production of larger 
quantities of toxin by more than 90% of a diverse spectrum 
of toxigenic strains in the presence of arbutin and D-Fru 
(Quigley and Gross, 1994). Some strains produced toxin in 
vitro only in the presence of these signals. Because syrin- 
gomycin production is an important element of virulence 
in P. s. syringue (Xu and Gross, 1988a, 1988b; Gross, 1991), 
this demonstrates that the detection of plant signal mole- 
cules can have a governing role in the establishment of 
disease. 
P. s. syringue is an important pathogen of sweet cherry 
(Prunus avium L.), causing stem cankers and necrotic le- 
sions on fruits and leaves (Cameron, 1962; Jones, 1971). 
Cherry tissues appear to contain plant signal molecules 
that are perceived by P. s. syringae based on evidence that 
the syrB-ZucZ fusion is transcriptionally activated in an 
environment containing plant constituents (Mo and Gross, 
1991a). First, inoculations of immature cherry fruits dem- 
onstrated that there is a rapid and strong expression of syrB 
in situ. For example, the syrB-lacZ fusion of strain B3AR132 
expressed peak activity of about 425 P-galactosidase units 
after only 24 h of incubation. Second, addition of a water- 
soluble extract from cherry leaves to SRM medium con- 
verted it into a medium favorable for expression of the 
syrB-ZacZ fusion in strain B3AR132. When SRM medium 
was not amended with the cherry leaf extract, strain 
B3AR132 failed to exhibit detectable P-galactosidase activ- 
ity. This demonstrated that the cherry leaf extract con- 
tained a constituent or signal that was sensed by the bac- 
terium, eventually leading to transcriptional activation of 
syrB. Furthermore, studies by Krzesinska et al. (1993) indi- 
cated that susceptibility of cherry genotypes to bacterial 
canker is correlated with signal activity. Extracts from the 
stems of 12 cherry genotypes were tested for syrB-inducing 
activity, and the genotypes most susceptible to bacterial 
canker contained higher (I’ = 0.01) signal activities than 
resistant genotypes. Consequently, both the quantity and 
quality of plant metabolites with signal activity may have 
an acute effect on disease development. 
Despite evidence that specific plant metabolites have a 
vital role as signals in the interaction of P.  s. syringae with 
plant hosts, little is known about the number, quantity, and 
chemical species of signals contained in host tissues. The 
objective of this study was to determine the nature of the 
syrB-inducing activity associated with cherry leaves. Al- 
though an earlier survey (Mo and Gross, 1991b) identified 
a few phenolic P-glucosides with signal activity, none of 
the active substances are reported to occur in P.  avium 
tissues. Moreover, a lack of syrB-inducing activity for sev- 
era1 phenolic glycosides, such as amygdalin and phlorid- 
zin, indicated that relatively few plant phenolic substances 
can serve as signals. In a preliminary report (Geibel et al., 
1994), we described the chromatographic and spectro- 
scopic (UV and NMR) characteristics of quercetin 3-rutino- 
syl-4’-glucoside and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4‘-glucoside 
from P. avium leaves. Here we report details of the frac- 
tionation of phenolic signal activity from cherry leaves into 
three regions by HI’LC. We demonstrate that two flavonol 
glycosides (quercetin and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4’-glu- 
cosides) and a flavanone glucoside (dihydrowogonin 
7-glucoside) exhibit syrB-inducing activity and that their 
signal activities are enhanced substantially by D-Fru. The 
specific signal activities of the flavonoid glycosides are 
reported, and this is discussed in relation to the host- 
pathogen interaction. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Bacterial Strains, Media, and Chemicals 
Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae strain B3A-R and its 
Tox- derivatives B3AR132 and B3AR253 were described 
by Mo and Gross (1991a, 1991b). Strain B3AR132 carries an 
in-frame syrB-lacZ fusion, generated by Tn3HoHol mu- 
tagenesis (Stachel et al., 1985a), recombined into the chro- 
mosome of B3A-R by marker exchange, whereas strain 
B3AR253 carries a syrB-lacZ fusion oriented opposite to the 
direction of syrB transcription. P-Galactosidase activity 
was expressed by strain B3AR132 under conditions condu- 
cive to syringomycin production (Mo and Gross, 1991a); 
strain B3AR253 does not express P-galactosidase activity. 
Methods used for routine culture of strains were described 
by Mo and Gross (1991b). 
SRM liquid medium (Gross, 1985) was used for assays of 
syrB induction. SRM medium contains 55.5 mM D-G~c, 19.1 
mM L-His, 0.8 mM MgS0,.7H,O, 0.8 mM potassium phos- 
phate, and 10 p~ FeC1, (FeC1, was added to SRM medium 
immediately before use). Complete SRM medium was used 
as the basal medium in a11 tests of fractions from cherry 
leaves for syrB-inducing activity. 
Arbutin, a phenolic P-glucoside with syrB-inducing ac- 
tivity (Mo and Gross, 1991b), rutin (quercetin 3-rutinoside), 
quercetin, quercetin 3-rhamnoside, and kaempferol were 
purchased from Sigma. Arbutin was dissolved in water, 
whereas quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, and quercetin 3- 
rhamnoside, which are not highly soluble in water, were 
dissolved in DMSO. Stock solutions (100 mM) were filter 
sterilized and stored at -20°C before use. A11 sugars, in- 
cluding D-Fru and D-Man, were purchased from Sigma.

Signal Molecules of Prunus avium That lnduce the syrS Locus 605 
described by Mo and Gross (1991b). The method of Miller 
(1972), as modified by Stachel et al. (1985a), was used to 
measure P-galactosidase activity resulting from expression 
of the syrB-ZacZ fusion in strain B3AR132. AI1 bioassays 
were performed in SRM medium containing test com- 
pounds (cherry leaf fractions or known phenolic com- 
pounds); a11 final volumes were 5 mL. Typically, leaf ex- 
tracts and fractions from chromatographs (paper or HPLC) 
were dissolved in deionized water, filter sterilized, and 
then added to SRM medium in volumes of 10 to 50 pL. 
Insoluble fractions, sterilized as described below, were air 
dried and added in 10-mg quantities to SRM medium. 
Arbutin, tested at a final concentration of 10 p ~ ,  was 
included in a11 trials as a control for monitoring levels of 
syrB induction to ensure uniformity among experiments. 
Background levels of P-galactosidase activity were deter- 
mined from cultures of B3AR132 grown in SRM medium 
lacking signal molecules or from cultures of the noninduc- 
ible syrB-lacZ mutant, B3AR253. Conditions for incubation 
of cultures and processing of cells for P-galactosidase ac- 
tivity were as described in detail by Mo and Gross (1991b). 
In routine assays, duplicate cultures were prepared for a11 
fraction samples tested for signal activity; two samples 
from each culture were assayed for P-galactosidase activ- 
ity. In assays of pure phenolic compounds, two trials were 
conducted on separate days with each trial consisting of 
duplicate cultures. 
The effects of D-Fru, D-Man, SUC, and other sugars (Mo 
and Gross, 1991b) on the activities of phenolic signal mol- 
ecules were measured at a final concentration of 0.1% 
(w/v) in SRM medium. Quercetin, quercetin 3-rhamno- 
side, rutin, and kaempferol were tested for syrB-inducing 
activity at final concentrations of 10 and 100 p ~ ,  which 
were added as 5 IJ.L of stock solution (dissolved in DMSO) 
to SRM medium. The 5-pL volumes of DMSO added to 
SRM medium were previously shown to have no effect on 
syrB induction (Mo and Gross, 1991b). 
Extraction of Signal Molecdes from Cherry Leaves 
Cherry (Prunus avium L.) cv Bing, grown in an approxi- 
mately 25-year-old orchard at the Irrigated Agriculture 
Research and Extension Center, Prosser, WA, was used as 
the source of leaves for extraction of signal molecules. 
Leaves were harvested in early May about 4 weeks after 
bloom. Prior to storage at -8O"C, leaves were rinsed in 
running tap water, blotted dry with paper towels, and 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
In initial experiments, leaves (100 g) were homogenized 
in deionized water, methanol (25, 50, 75, and 100%), or 
chloroform at a 1:3 ratio (w/v) to compare the relative 
recoveries of total signal activities. The homogenates were 
centrifuged (lO,OOOg, 10 min), and the supernatants were 
reduced to dryness by flash evaporation. The dried extract 
was dissolved in 8 mL of water and filter sterilized; appro- 
priate dilutions were tested in 50-pL aliquants for syrB- 
inducing activity. 
Because the aqueous leaf extract yielded the highest total 
signal activity, it was further purified by extraction with 
polar solvents following the three steps summarized in 
Figure 1. After cherry leaves (100 g) were homogenized (i.e. 
step A) in deionized water at a 1:3 ratio (w/v), the homo- 
genate was centrifuged (lO,OOOg, 10 min) to pellet insoluble 
plant material. A 1-mL sample of the supernatant was 
collected for bioassay, filter sterilized, and stored at -80°C 
prior to bioassay. The pellet was sterilized by treatment 
with 70% ethanol and air dried. In step B, the supernatant 
was adjusted to a final concentration of 75% (v/v) acetone, 
stirred vigorously for 10 min, and centrifuged (lO,OOOg, 10 
min) to pellet insoluble material. A 4-mL sample of the 
supernatant was collected for bioassay; it was reduced to 
dryness by flash evaporation, redissolved in 1 mL of deion- 
ized water, filter sterilized, and stored at -80°C prior to 
bioassay. In step C, the bulk of the supernatant was re- 
duced to dryness by flash evaporation and then extracted 
with 95% ethanol at 78°C for 20 min. After centrifugation 
(lO,OOOg, 10 min), the ethanol-soluble fraction was reduced 
to dryness by flash evaporation, redissolved in 10 mL of 
deionized water, and filter sterilized. The pellets obtained 
in steps B and C were air dried, redissolved in 1 mL of 
deionized water, filter sterilized, and stored at -80°C prior 
to bioassay. The recoveries of signal activities were deter- 
mined based on the dry and fresh weights of cherry leaf 
tissue. 
HPLC Analysis of Signal Molecules 
The crude cherry leaf extract was analyzed by HPLC for 
fractions containing signal activity. A 200-pL sample of the 
crude extract (Fig. 1) was injected into a Waters HPLC 
system (Millipore, Milford, MA) equipped with an Altex 
Ultrasphere-ODS column (250 X 10 mm, semipreparative 
C,, reversed-phase column; Beckman Instruments, Fuller- 
ton, CA). The column was eluted for 60 min at a flow rate

separate occasions; each assay consisted of duplicate samples from 
two cultures.

of 2 mL min-' with an initial equilibration for 2 min in 
0.1% TFA, followed by a O to 60% methanol gradient in 
0.1% TFA. The compounds were monitored at A,,,, 
A,,,, and A,,, using a Waters 990 photodiode array detec- 
tor. The eluent fractions were collected every minute, dried 
by lyophilization, and redissolved in 200 p L  of water. After 
filter sterilization, a 10-pL sample from each fraction was 
assayed as described above for syrB-inducing activity. 
Large-Scale Purification of Phenolic Signal Molecules 
Initial HPLC separations of crude extracts identified a 
poorly resolved region at fractions 47 to 49, called region A 
(Fig. 2), with signal activity. Consequently, preparative 
paper chromatography of the crude ethanol extract from 
cherry leaves was used for large-scale purification. Paper 
chromatograms were developed for about 6 h in a butanol: 
ethano1:water (4:1:2.2) solvent system (Markham, 1982) and 
air dried. Prior analysis determined that the phenolic sub- 
stances associated with region A were visible at A,,, as a 
dark gray band with an R, value of 0.35; more than half of 
the signal activity of the crude extract originally applied to 
the chromatogram was associated with this dark gray 
band. The band was excised from the paper and extracted 
overnight with deionized water (approximately 10 mL per 
band). The aqueous extract was reduced to dryness by 
flash evaporation, redissolved in 300 pL of deionized wa- 
ter, and then further purified by HPLC. HPLC peak frac- 
tions showing appreciable activity were individually re- 
chromatographed by HPLC and examined for purity by a 
Waters 911 program. 
To obtain more of the phenolic signal molecules in region 
A (Fig. 2), methanolic leaf extracts of P.  avium cv Sam were

extract, prepared as shown in Figure 1, was fractionated on a re-

TFA. Phenolic signal activities, as determined by induction of the 
syrE-1x2 fusion in strain B3AR132 of P. S. syringae, were observed 
in three peak regions (shaded regions labeled A, B, and C) :  region A, 
fractions 47 to 49 subsequently identified as a mixture of quercetin 
glycosides and kaempferol glycosides; region B, fractions 52 and 53; 
and region C, fractions 54 and 55 subsequently identified as dihy- 
drowogonin 7-glucoside. Signal activity also was observed in frac- 
tions 6 and 7 (void volume), which contained Fru. None of the other 
peaks and fractions contained signal activity. 
used. For purification, a repeated combination of column 
chromatography (400 X 25 mm, Polyamid SC-6, 0.05-0.16 
mm, solvent water) and preparative HPLC (250 X 20 mm, 
CI8 Polygosil 5 pm, methanol gradient) was necessary. 
Larger amounts of dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside were ob- 
tained by isolation from cherry bark (Geibel et al., 1990). 
ldentification of the Phenolic Signal Molecules 
Techniques used for identification of region A (HPLC, 
TLC, enzymatic and acidic hydrolysis, UV spectroscopy, 
and NMR) were described by Geibel et al. (1994). In region 
C the phenolic signal molecule was identified by HPLC, 
UV spectroscopy, and TLC by comparison with an authen- 
tic sample of dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside from Treutter et 
al. (1985). 
ldentification of HPLC Fraction 7, Which Enhances 
Phenolic Signal Activity 
HPLC fraction 7 enhanced the signal activity of the fla- 
vonoid glycosides isolated from cherry leaves, and thus 
was analyzed by TLC for the presence of sugars with 
enhancer activity. Samples from HPLC fraction 7 along 
with 14 sugar standards (i.e. L-Ara, D-cellobiose, D-Fru, 
L-FUC, D-Gal, D-G~c, a-lactose, maltose, D-Man, D-raffinose, 
L-rhamnose, D-Rib, SUC, and D-Xyl prepared as 10% [w/v] 
stocks) were loaded (5 pL per spot) onto silica gel type 60A 
TLC plates (Whatman) and run in a butano1:ethanol:water 
(4:1:2.2) solvent system for 5 h (Markham, 1982). After air 
drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a sugar-detecting 
reagent (3% phenol and 5% sulfuric acid in 95% ethanol) 
and developed at 100°C for 10 min (Bruno and Svoronos, 
1989). The R, values of reactive spots were calculated at the 
center of each spot. TLC analysis of HPLC fraction 7 
yielded a single spot with an R, value of 0.27; this region 
was scraped from preparative TLC plates, extracted over- 
night with deionized water, and dried by lyophilization. 
The sample was redissolved in deionized water (200 pL) 
and filter sterilized prior to assay for ability to enhance the 
signal activities of arbutin and the compound purified as 
peak 2 from HPLC region A (subsequently identified as 
quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4'-glucoside). 
RESULTS 
Extraction of syrl-lnducing Signal Molecules from 
Cherry Leaves 
An aqueous homogenate of cherry leaves yielded high 
amounts of total signal activity of more than 12,000 units 
g-' (fresh weight) of 0-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1); on a 
dry weight basis total signal activity was measured to be 
about 160,000 units g-'. The signal activity was not ex- 
tracted with chloroform, a nonpolar solvent. Extractions 
with 25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol yielded recoveries of 
98,44,40 and 11%, respectively, of the signal activity of an 
aqueous extract. The signal activity was resistant to expo- 
sure to heat (e.g. 100°C, 10 min) and could pass through a 
dialysis membrane with a 1000 mo1 wt cutoff.

Signal Molecules of Prunus avium That lnduce the syrB Locus 607 
Extraction of the crude aqueous extract with 75% acetone 
increased the specific activity by about 32% (step B, Fig. 1); 
extractions with either 50 or 100% acetone yielded lower 
recoveries of signal activity. Subsequent treatment with 
95% ethanol (step C, Fig. 1) yielded an additional 11% 
increase in the specific activity of the original crude extract; 
on a dry weight basis this represented a 3.7-fold increase 
in the specific activity as compared to total signal act- 
ivity after step A. No appreciable signal activity was asso- 
ciated with the insoluble fractions that were pelleted by 
centrifugation. 
HPLC Fractionation of Phenolic Signal Activity into 
Three Regions 
The ethanol-soluble cherry leaf extract fractionated by 
C,, reversed-phase HPLC contained three reproducible 
syrB-inducing regions located at retention times between 
47 and 55 min in a 60-min run (Fig. 2). Spectral analysis of 
a11 three peak regions indicated the presence of flavonoids 
(Markham, 1982) based on the occurrence of two absorp- 
tion maxima that were monitored at A266 and A,,,. Most of 
the syrB-inducing activity was associated with region A, 
which was composed of at least two peaks; region A ac- 
counted for approximately 42% of the recovered signal 
activity. Regions B and C also displayed significant signal 
activity as observed by the recoveries of 25 and 21%, re- 
spectively, of the recovered signal activity. In addition, 
about 12% of the recovered signal activity was eluted with 
the void volume between 6 and 7 min. Severa1 other peaks, 
observed at A214 (Fig. 2), were resolved by HPLC of the 
cherry leaf extract, but they did not exhibit signal activity. 
Because region A contained most of the signal activity 
extracted from cherry leaves, emphasis was placed on pu- 
rifying and identifying the phenolic substances within re- 
gion A. Preparative paper chromatography was used to 
concentrate and partially purify the signal molecules in 
region A prior to HPLC analysis. The crude ethanol-soluble 
fraction was resolved into eight bands detectable by UV

gray and accounted for about 60% of the initial syrB-induc- 
ing activity applied to the chromatogram. The phenolic 
substances from this band were fractionated by C,, re- 
versed-phase HPLC and shown to correspond with the 
phenolic signals identified as region A (Fig. 2). Unlike the 
HPLC profile of the ethanol-soluble fraction, however, sig- 
na1 regions B and C were not recovered. Region A was 
separated into three peaks, two major peaks and one minor 
peak with retention times ranging from 65 to 69 min in an 
80-min run (Fig. 3A). Assays of syrB induction revealed 
two peaks of activity corresponding to fractions with re- 
tention times of 66 to 67 (peak 2) and 68 to 69 (peak 31, 
accounting for 8.2 and 6.8%, respectively, of the initial 
unfractionated signal activity (approximately 57,000 units 
total of P-galactosidase activity) added to the HPLC col- 
umn (Fig. 3B). Total recovery of the peak-2 and -3 signal 
molecules was estimated to be about 4 mg/g (fresh weight) 
of leaf tissue. In addition, low signal activity (3% of the 
original activity) was detected in fractions 7 and 8, which

tions displayed enhancer activity. As observed in Figure 
3B, HPLC fraction 7 caused about a 10-fold increase in the 
activities of peaks 2 and 3. Combined signal activities of 
peaks 2 and 3 in the presence of HPLC fraction 7 was 
estimated to total about 100,000 units, which was nearly 
twice the activity of the unfractionated sample. 
HPLC Fraction 7 1s Composed of a Sugar That Enhances 
Phenolic Signal Activity 
HPLC fraction 7 added at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) 
enhanced the signal activity of arbutin by more than 5-fold. 
Such levels of enhanced syrB induction in the presence of 
HPLC fraction 7 were similar to the effects of a few sugars, 
including D-Fru and D-Man, on phenolic signal activity 
(Mo and Gross, 1991b). Separation of HPLC fraction 7 by 
TLC followed by treatment with the phenol-sulfuric acid 
reagent for sugars revealed a single dark greenish-blue 
spot with an R, value of 0.27 (not shown). Compared to 14 
sugar standards, only D-Fru and D-Man had similar R, 
values and coloration. Assays for syrB induction showed 
that a11 enhancer activity separated by preparative TLC 
was associated with the greenish-blue area and that it had 
intrinsic but relatively low syrB-inducing activity. 
The syrB-inducing activities of arbutin and quercetin 
3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside (i.e. peak 2 of region A) were sim- 
ilarly enhanced by the same set of sugars. For example, 
D-Fru caused a 10- to 12-fold increase in their activities 
when assayed at low concentrations (Table I). D-Man, 
which does not exhibit intrinsic syrB-inducing activity (Mo 
and Gross, 1991b), caused a 4-fold increase in the activities 
of both phenolic signal molecules (data not shown).

The phenolic signal molecule located at HPLC region C 
(Fig. 2) was identified as dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside (Fig.

the flavanone glucoside on TLC plates under UV light and 
by a UV spectrum with a prominent A,,, at 286 nm and a 
minor broad A,,, at 346 nm. Co-chromatography of the 
fraction with an authentic sample of dihydrowogonin 
7-glucoside (Treutter et al., 1985) by HPLC resulted in an 
identical retention time. Hydrolysis of the compound 
yielded the aglucone, dihydrowogonin (A,,, 290 and 334 
nm). The phenolic signal(s) located at HPLC region B (Fig.

syrB-lnducing Activities of Flavonoid Clycoside Signal

ties from P. avium displayed similar syrB-inducing activity 
profiles at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 PM (Fig.

1 00 p~ of dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside (O), kaempferol 3-rutinosyl- 
4’-glucoside (H), or quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside (A). Each 
value i s  the mean of two trials conducted on separate occasions; 
each trial consisted of duplicate cultures. The background leve1 of 
P-galactosidase activity was subtracted. Vertical bars indicate the SE. 
900 units of P-galactosidase activity. Although only low 
activities of less than 15 units were observed at 1 p ~ ,  
moderate activities averaging between 60 and 160 units 
were observed at 5 and 10 PM; such levels of signal activity 
were comparable to those reported for arbutin and a few 
other phenolic P-glucosides (Mo and Gross, 1991b). Dihy- 
drowogonin 7-glucoside showed slightly higher activities 
than the two flavonol glycosides, but these differences 
were not significant. Insufficient quantities of quercetin 
3,4’-diglucoside and kaempferol3,4’-diglucoside were pu- 
rified from cherry leaves for measurements of possible 
syrB-inducing activity . 
The syrB-inducing activities of the three purified fla- 
vonoid glycosides from cherry were enhanced by about 
10-fold by the addition (0.1%) of D-Fru (Table I). The two 
flavonol triglycosides, quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4‘-glucoside 
and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside, and the fla- 
vanone glycoside, dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside, had simi- 
lar specific activities of syrB induction at 10 p~ concentra- 
tions yielding more than 1300 units of activity when Fru 
was present; this represents between 380 and 800 units 
pg-’ of signal activity. Moreover, the syrB-inducing activ- 
ities of the flavonoid glycosides were not significantly dif- 
ferent from that of arbutin. In the absence of phenolic 
signals, D-Fru yielded about 100 units of intrinsic syrB- 
inducing activity. 
The relationship of chemical structure to signal activity 
was examined by testing components and substituted de- 
rivatives of active flavonoid glycosides. Although the com- 
mercial availability of such compounds is limited, it ap- 
pears that glucosylation at position 4‘ in the flavonol 
signals is essential for activity based on a lack of signal 
activity for rutin (i.e. quercetin 3-rutinoside). Correspond- 
ingly, tests of quercetin 3-rhamnoside also failed to show 
syrB-inducing activity, indicating that glycosylation at po- 
sition 3 of the flavonoid structure was insufficient for sig- 
na1 activity. The phenolic aglycone moieties, quercetin and 
kaempferol, of the flavonol signals were inactive as ex- 
pected (Mo and Gross, 1991b). 
DISCUSSION 
The leaves of P. avium contain significant quantities of 
plant signal molecules that are perceived by P.  s. syringae to 
activate the syrB gene necessary for syringomycin produc- 
tion and full virulence. A11 of the signal activity was soluble 
in water and was composed of two types of signal mole- 
cules, namely phenolic glycosides and sugars. The phenolic 
signals were separated by HPLC into three regions, which 
indicated that relatively few phenolic substances in cherry 
leaves display appreciable signal activity. Moreover, the 
phenolic signals in regions A and C were identified as 
flavonoid glycosides, a class of phenolics that had not yet 
been reported to exhibit syrB-inducing activity (Mo and 
Gross, 1991b). Two flavonol glycosides, quercetin 3-rutino- 
syl-4’-glucoside and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside, 
occurred in region A, and the flavanone glucoside, dihy- 
drowogonin 7-glucoside, occurred in region C. Dihy-

drowogonin 7-glucoside is the primary flavonoid occurring 
in the bark tissues of P. avium (Treutter et al., 1985). Rela- 
tively high amounts of dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside occur 
in tissues based on the recovery from phloem of more than 
11 mg g-' (dry weight) (Treutter et al., 1985, 1987). 
In P.  avium leaves, dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside is lo- 
cated exclusively in the main veins so that the concentra- 
tion in the total leaf is significantly lower than in the bark 
(Gutmann, 1993). Typical for the phenolic composition of 
leaves is the occurrence of flavonols (Bauer et al., 1989). 
Because the other main flavonols (e.g. rutin and 
kaempferol 3-rutinoside) show no signal activity, the two 
flavonol triglycosides are the most important compounds 
with signal activity. We estimated that crude cherry leaf 
extracts contain more than 160,000 units g-' (dry weight) 
of total signal activity, and this reflects both the relatively 
high quantities of flavonoid glycoside signals that occur in 
leaves and their corresponding specific signal activities 
estimated to be between 380 and 800 units pg-* in the 
presence of D-Fru (Table I). It was not surprising to find 
that the total signal activity recovered from cherry leaves 
increased at each step in purification because crude plant 
extracts contain substances that are not active and also may 
inhibit expression of syrB, such as phenolic aglycones (Mo 
and Gross, 1991b; Quigley and Gross, 1994). Chlorogenic 
acid, the main phenolic compound in cherry leaves (Bauer 
et al., 1989), inhibits the growth of P. s. syringae in vitro by 
about 75% (Bayer, 1989). Nevertheless, induction of the 
syrB-lacZ fusion in strain B3AR132 by the crude extract was 
substantial, and this indicates that there are sufficient 
quantities of the flavonoid glycoside signals to induce phy- 
totoxin production by P. s. syringae as it invades cherry 
leaves. 
The signal activities of the flavonoid glycosides were 
markedly enhanced in the presence of sugars that com- 
monly occur in high quantities in the leaves of P.  avium. Suc 
and D-Fru were the most effective sugars, causing a 10-fold 
stimulation of signal activity when flavonoid glycosides 
occurred at low concentrations. In addition, Suc and D-Fru 
are the only sugars known to have intrinsic, but low level, 
syrB-inducing signal activity (Mo and Gross, 1991b). Con- 
sequently, the signal activity associated with the void vol- 
ume in HPLC profiles is attributed to the presence of both 
sugars; this is substantiated by the occurrence of D-Fru in 
the sample containing flavonol glucosides extracted from 
paper chromatograms. Both Suc and Fru compose more 
than 3% of the dry weight of various tissues of P. avium 
(Schmid and Feucht, 1986; Keller and Loescher, 1989). 
These are ample quantities of sugars with signal activity for 
rapid and efficient induction of syrB in cherry tissues be- 
cause Fru levels as low as 0.001% (w/v) enhance phenolic 
signal activity (Mo and Gross, 1991b). Although enhance- 
ment of flavonoid glycoside-mediated induction of syrB by 
specific sugars resembles the sensory mechanism respon- 
sible for activation of vir genes in A.  tumefaciens, there are 
important differences in sugar specificities between the 
two systems because vir genes are not induced by Suc and 
D-Fru (Ankenbauer and Nester, 1990; Cangelosi et al., 1990; 
Shimoda et al., 1990; Mo and Gross, 1991b). 
Our discovery that P. avium leaves contain flavonol and 
flavanone glycosides with signal activity demonstrates that 
P. s. syringae senses plant metabolites representative of 
distinct categories of phenolic compounds, including fla- 
vonoids, coumarins, and phenols (Mo and Gross, 1991b). A 
common structural feature of a11 syrB-inducing phenolic 
signal molecules is the presence of an intact glucosidic 
linkage. For example, a11 signal activity is lost if the glu- 
cosidic linkage of quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4'-glucoside is 
cleaved to yield rutin (i.e. quercetin 3-rutinoside); fla- 
vonoid aglycones, such as quercetin and kaempferol, like- 
wise lack signal activity. Because plants generally accumu- 
late and store phenolic compounds as glycosides to make 
them more water soluble and less chemically reactive 
(Hosel, 1981), phenolic glycosides would be more accessi- 
ble and less likely to be inhibitory to P. s. syringae. Accord- 
ingly, Bayer (1989) observed that dihydrowogonin 7-glu- 
coside, tested at 1 mM, was not inhibitory to the growth of 
P. s. syringae. In comparison to arbutin (Table I), the flavo- 
no1 and flavanone glycoside signals from cherry leaves 
were found to be equally effective as signal molecules. 
Furthermore, the specific syrB-inducing activities of fla- 
vonoid glycosides from P. avium leaves, especially in the 
presence of soluble carbohydrates such as Fru, are compa- 
rable to the levels reported for plant metabolites with vir- 
or nod-inducing activity (Firmin et al., 1986; Melchers et al., 
1989). 
In earlier studies, it was established that a syrB-lacZ gene 
fusion can be used to measure environmental factors that 
influence expression of syringomycin synthesis (Mo and 
Gross, 1991a, 1991b). Accordingly, it proved in this study 
to be a convenient and powerful tool for assaying signal 
activity extracted from leaves of P. avium. The relationship 
of plant signal molecules to toxigenesis in P. s. syringae was 
substantiated by the conservation of the syrB gene in a11 
toxigenic strains and by induction of higher levels of sy- 
ringomycin production in almost a11 toxigenic strains 
(Quigley and Gross, 1994). It now appears that the plant- 
inducible syrB gene encodes an adenylate-forming enzyme 
that activates and binds one of the structural amino acids of 
syringomycin and that SyrB participates in a thiotemplate 
mechanism of peptide synthesis (J.-H. Zhang, N.B. Quig- 
ley, and D.C. Gross, unpublished data). Because other syr 
loci, including syrC, appear to be transcriptionally acti- 
vated by chemical stimuli of plant origin (Mo and Gross, 
1991a, 1991b), it would not be surprising to discover that 
other virulence genes of P. s. syringae are controlled by the 
same signal transduction process. Consequently, the patho- 
genicity of P.  s. syringae in cherry leaves would be modu- 
lated by the perception of flavonoid glycosides and sugars 
that serve as signal molecules. 
The control of toxigenesis in P.  s. syringae by plant signal 
molecules reflects its ability to adapt to a dynamic plant 
environment. A common predisposing factor to infection of 
cherry by P.  s. syringae is frost injury (Zeller and Schmidle, 
1979; Gross et al., 1984). The occurrence of an injurious 
frost would lead not only to wounding of cherry tissues 
and leakage of nutrients but also to the sudden release of 
phenolic glycoside signals, the bulk of which are compart-

Signal Molecules of Prunus a v i m  That lnduce the syr6 Locus 61 1 
mentalized in vacuoles (Hosel, 1981). Because high 
amounts  of flavonoid glycoside signals occur in P. uvium 
leaves, one can speculate that their sudden release would 
be quickly sensed by the bacterium and lead to activation 
of genes, such  as syrB,  necessary for phytotoxin produc- 
tion. In addition, it appears that a broad spectrum of P. s. 
syringue strains would be capable of recognizing the fla- 
vonoid glycoside signals from P. uvium. This is based on 
evidence that most strains of P.  s. syringue attack a wide 
range of plant hosts (Bradbury, 1986) and that they recog- 
nize phenolic signal molecules that are found in the  leaves, 
bark, and flowers of many plant species (Mo and Gross, 
1991b; Quigley and Gross, 1994). Moreover, the flavonol 
glycoside signals, quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside and 
kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4’-glucoside, were reported by 
Saleh et  al. (1983) to  occur i n  five species of Erodium 
(Geraniaceae subsection Mulucoidea) as the major flavonoid 
glycosides in foliar tissues. Therefore, the occurrence of a 
sensory mechanism for specific phenolic glycosides is ad- 
vantageous because it signals the bacterium to activate 
rapidly virulence genes in a favorable plant environment. 
Correspondingly, host plants harbor phenolics with the 
fundamental chemical structures for signal activity t o  sus- 
tain an aggressive attack by the  pathogen. Host  resistance 
as observed, for example, in cherry cultivars (Krzesinska et  
al., 1993) may reflect qualitative and quantitative differ- 
ences i n  signal molecules or  the balance of plant substances 
that antagonize induction by plant signals.
