Acacia polyphenol (AP) extracted from the bark of the black wattle tree (Acacia meansii) is rich in unique catechin-like ﬂavan-
3-ols, such as robinetinidol and ﬁsetinidol. The present study investigated the anti-obesity/anti-diabetic eﬀects of AP using obese
diabetic KKAy mice. KKAy mice received either normal diet, high-fat diet or high-fat diet with additional AP for 7 weeks. After the
end of administration, body weight, plasma glucose and insulin were measured. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression of
obesity/diabetic suppression-related genes were measured in skeletal muscle, liver and white adipose tissue. As a result, compared
to the high-fat diet group, increases in body weight, plasma glucose and insulin were signiﬁcantly suppressed for AP groups.
Furthermore, compared to the high-fat diet group, mRNA expression of energy expenditure-related genes (PPARα,P P A R δ,C P T 1 ,
ACO and UCP3) was signiﬁcantly higher for AP groups in skeletal muscle. Protein expressions of CPT1, ACO and UCP3 for AP
groups were also signiﬁcantly higher when compared to the high-fat diet group. Moreover, AP lowered the expression of fat acid
synthesis-related genes (SREBP-1c, ACC and FAS) in the liver. AP also increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and decreased
expression of TNF-α in white adipose tissue. In conclusion, the anti-obesity actions of AP are considered attributable to increased
expression of energy expenditure-related genes in skeletal muscle, and decreased fatty acid synthesis and fat intake in the liver.
These results suggest that AP is expected to be a useful plant extract for alleviating metabolic syndrome.
1.Introduction
Acacia is an evergreen tree belonging to the genus Acacia in
the family legume, and is widely found in the Australian and
African continents. The extract of Acacia catechu duramen
is called gambir, and has long been used as an astringent
and anti-bacterial to treat stomatitis and diarrhea in Japan
and China. Studies have also reported that the powdered
seeds of Acacia catechu and Acacia milanoxylon exhibit
hypoglycemic actions by increasing insulin secretion in non-
diabetic rats and rabbits [1, 2]. Furthermore, in Europe,
acacia polyphenol (AP) extracted from the bark of the black
wattle tree (Acacia meansii) has been used to eliminate wine
sediment. Australian aborigines also eat the young leaves and
beans of Acacia mollissima.
AP is rich in unique catechin-like ﬂavan-3-ols, such as
robinetinidol and ﬁsetinidol [3–6]. In recent years, polyphe-
nols have been reported to possess various pharmacological
actions, including anti-obesity actions [7–9], anti-diabetic
actions[10–12],anti-canceractions[13,14]andanti-allergic
actions [15]. While polyphenol-rich AP may possess various
pharmacological actions like other polyphenols, no studies
have yet clariﬁed the pharmacological actions of AP.
In the present study, to investigate the anti-obesity and
anti-diabetic actions of AP, a high-fat diet was administered
to KKAy mice, an obese type-II diabetes model, to induce
severe obesity and diabetes. The eﬀects of AP on obesity
and diabetes were then studied. To elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the suppression of obesity and diabetes, the
eﬀects of AP on the expression of genes related to obesity
and diabetes suppression in skeletal muscle, liver and white
adipose tissue were investigated.
2.MaterialsandMethods
2.1. Hot Water Extraction from Acacia Bark. AP was donated
by Mimozax Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan), and was prepared2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
according to the methods reported by Cutting [16]. Brieﬂy,
the powdered bark of South African A. mollissima was
pulverized and extracted for 30 min in a 10-fold volume of
hot water (100◦C) and then dried using a spray drier. The
polyphenol content of the present product as measured by
the Stiasny reaction was 79.0% [17–19]. Average molecular
weight of AP is 1250 (300–3000) [20, 21], and robinetinidol
and ﬁsetinidol are the major ingredients [3–6].
2.2. Materials. Powdered regular low-fat diet (LF) (10%
lard, D12450B) and powdered high-fat diet (HF) (60%
lard, D12492) were purchased from Research Diets (New
Brunswick, NJ, USA). Primers were purchased from Invitro-
gen (Tokyo, Japan). The ECL Plus Western Blotting Detec-
tion System was purchased from GE Healthcare (Chalfont
St Giles, UK). Anti-rabbit ACO antibody and anti-rabbit
UCP3 antibody were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
UK). Anti-rabbit CPT1 antibody was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-rabbit β-
actin antibody was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego,
CA, USA). Anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) peroxidase
conjugatewas purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO,
USA). All other reagents were of the highest commercially
available grade.
2.3. Animals, Diets and Treatment. Male KKAy mice (5-
weeks old) were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan).
Each mouse was caged separately and kept at room tem-
perature (22±1◦C) and 55±10% humidity with 12h of
light (artiﬁcial illumination: 08:00–20:00). Mice that had
been acclimatized for 1 week were divided into four groups.
Each group was provided with ad libitum access to either
LF, HF, HF containing 2.5% (w/w) AP (HF/AP 2.5%)
or HF containing 5.0% (w/w) AP (HF/AP 5.0%) for 7
weeks. Food intake was measured once weekly. Following
this feeding period, after 17h of fasting, a blood sample
was collected using heparin from the abdominal vena cava
under diethyl ether-induced anesthesia. The liver, white
adipose tissue (around the testes, retroperitoneum and
kidney) and skeletal muscle were also removed and placed
in either neutral-buﬀered formalin or liquid nitrogen. The
present study was conducted in accordance with the Guiding
Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal, as
adopted by the Committee on Animal Research at Hoshi
University.
2.4. Blood Analysis. Blood samples were centrifuged (1000g
for 15min at 4◦C), and plasma stored at −80◦C until
assay. Plasma glucose concentrations were enzymatically
quantiﬁed using a Glucose CII Test (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Osaka, Japan). Plasma insulin concentrations
were measured according to the protocol described by the
manufacturer of the Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit (Shibayagi,
Gunma, Japan). Plasma glutamate oxalacetate transaminase
(GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) concen-
trations were quantiﬁed using Transaminase CII Test (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries).
2.5. Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance
Index. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR), an index of insulin resistance, was calculated
according to the following equation using fasting insulin and
glucose concentrations [22]:

2.6. Measurement of Liver Triglyceride/Cholesterol Content.
Liver triglyceride and cholesterol content were measured as
described previously [23, 24]. Brieﬂy, a portion (100mg)
of liver tissue was homogenized in phosphate buﬀer saline
(pH 7.4, 1ml). The homogenate (0.2ml) was extracted
with isopropyl alcohol (1ml), and the extract was analyzed
using a Triglyceride E-Test (Wako Pure Chemical Industries)
to determine liver triglyceride content. The homogenate
(0.2ml) was extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1,
1ml), and the extract was concentrated under a nitrogen
stream. The residue was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol and
analyzed using a Cholesterol E-Test (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries).
2.7. Preparation of Slide for Histopathology
2.7.1. Hematoxylin—Eosin Staining. Liver and epididymal
fat were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buﬀered formalin. After
trimming the tissues, liver and epididymal fat were embed-
ded in paraﬃn using a tissue processor. Sections were
t a k e ni n3 - 4μm thicknesses, and stained with HE solution
for microscopy. Average surface area for epididymal white
adipocytes was measured using Image J software (National
Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [25, 26].
2.7.2. Oil red O Staining. After frozen liver sections about
7μm thick were prepared using a cryostat apparatus, oil red
O staining was conducted for microscopy.
2.8. RNA Preparation from Tissue Samples. RNA was
extracted from about 50mg of frozen skeletal muscle using
TRI reagent. RNA was extracted from about 15mg of frozen
liver using the RNeasy Mini Kit. RNA was extracted from
about 75mg of frozen epididymal white adipose tissue using
the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit. RNA extraction was
performed according to the protocol for the TRI Reagent,
RNeasy Mini Kit and RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit. The
resulting solution was diluted 50-fold using TE buﬀer, and
purity was conﬁrmed and RNA concentration (μgml

a U-2800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi High Technologies,
Tokyo, Japan).
2.9. Real-time RT-PCR. A high-capacity cDNA synthesis
kit was used to synthesize cDNA from 1μgo fR N A .T E
buﬀer was used to dilute the cDNA 20-fold to prepare
cDNA TE buﬀer solution. The expression of target genesEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3

temperature at 72◦C for 30 s. Fluorescence intensity of the
ampliﬁcation process was monitored using the My iQTM
Single Color Real-time RT-PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). mRNA expressions were normalized using β-
actin.AllmRNAexpressionswereexpressedinrelationtothe
average expression of the LF group (100%).
2.10. Western Blotting Analysis. Leg muscle (100 mg) was
homogenized using dissecting buﬀer (0.3M sucrose, 25mM
imidazole, 1mM EDTA, pH 7.2, containing 8.5μMl e u -
peptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride), and the
homogenates were centrifuged at 500g for 10min at 4◦C
[27, 28]. Total protein content in the supernatants was
determined by the Lowry method [29] using bovine serum
albumin as a standard.
Electrophoresis was performed using the method
described by Laemmli [30]. Using the loading buﬀer (84
mM Tris, 20% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, pH
6.3, 4.6% SDS and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), protein was
diluted 2-fold, boiled for 5min and applied to 12.5%
polyacrylamide gel (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After
electrophoresis, the isolated proteins were transferred to
a PVDF membrane (ATTO Corp.) using CompactBLOT
(AE-7500, ATTO Corp.). After blocking for 1h using 1.0%
skim milk, the resulting membrane was reacted for 1h at
room temperature with anti-rabbit CPT1 antibody (1:100),
ACO antibody (1:200), UCP3 antibody (1:1,000) or β-
actin antibody (1:200). After washing the membrane using
TBS-TWEEN (Tris-HCl 20mM, NaCl 137mM and Tween
20 0.1%, pH 7.6), the resulting membrane was reacted for
1h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase
conjugate. After washing, the membrane was reacted with
the ECLplus detection reagent and visualized with an
LAS-3000 mini luminoimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo,
Japan). Protein levels were normalized against β-actin. All
protein expressions are given as percentages compared to the
LF group (100%).
2.11. Statistical Analysis. Numerical data are expressed as
means±standard deviation. The signiﬁcance of diﬀerences
wasexaminedusingANOVA,followedbyTukey’stest.Values
of P <.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Body Weight and Visceral Fat Accumulation. During the
7-week experimental period, food intake was measured once
weekly. Mean energy intake was signiﬁcantly higher for the
HF group than for the LF group. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence
existed in energy intake between the HF, HF/AP 2.5% and
HF/AP 5.0% groups (Table 2).
At the end of administration, body weight was signiﬁ-
cantly higher for the HF group than for the LF group. AP
administration signiﬁcantly suppressed HF-induced body
weight increases. In particular, the degree of body weight
increase was comparable between the HF/AP 5.0% and LF
groups (Table 2).4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

KKAy mice were given a low-fat diet (LF), a high-fat diet (HF), HF containing 2.5% AP (HF/AP 2.5%) or HF containing 5.0% AP (HF/AP 5.0%) for 7 weeks.
After measuring body weight, white adipose tissue and liver were removed and weighed, and levels of liver triglyceride and cholesterol were measured. Blood
samples were also collected to measure glucose, insulin, GOT and GPT levels. HOMA-IR was calculated from glucose and insulin levels after overnight fasting.

Furthermore, visceral white adipose tissue weight was
signiﬁcantly higher for the HF group than for the LF group.

HE staining of epididymal white adipose tissue showed
that mature adipocytes for the HF group were hypertro-
phied, with numerous immature adipocytes in the stroma.
Conversely, HF-induced hypertrophy of mature adipocytes
was not seen for the HF/AP 5.0% group, and the size
of adipocytes and number of immature adipocytes were
comparable to those for the LF group (Figure 1).
3.2. Liver Lipid Accumulation. Table 2 shows liver weight
and liver lipid content. At the end of administration, liver
weight was about 1.8 times greater for the HF group than for
the LF group. In addition, liver triglyceride and cholesterol
levels were signiﬁcantly higher for the HF group when
comparedtotheLFgroup.ForbothHF/AP2.5%andHF/AP
5.0% groups, increased liver weight and triglyceride and
cholesterol accumulation were signiﬁcantly suppressed.
The liver was subjected to HE staining and oil red O
staining, and the HF group displayed large fat droplets
throughout liver lobules. However, HF/AP 2.5% and HF/AP
5.0% groups showed smaller fat droplets in individual
hepatocyte and fewer fat droplets throughout liver lobules,
thus indicating suppression of fatty liver (Figure 2).
3.3. Plasma Glucose, Insulin, GOT and GPT Concentration.
Table 2 shows fasting plasma glucose, plasma insulin, GOT
and GPT. Plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels were
signiﬁcantly higher for the HF group than for the LF group.
Conversely, plasma glucose and insulin levels for the AP
groups decreased to levels similar to those for the LF group,
and HOMA-IR index in the HF/AP 2.5% and HF/AP 5.0%
groups was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to the HF
group. Plasma GOT and GPT, indicators of hepatopathy,
were signiﬁcantly higher for the HF group than for the LF
group. AP administration signiﬁcantly suppressed increases
in GOT and GPT.
3.4. mRNA and Protein Expression in the Skeletal Muscle.
Real-time RT-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA
expression of energy expenditure-related genes (peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α,P P A R δ, carnitine
palmitoyl-transferase1(CPT1),acylCoAoxidase(ACO)and
uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3)) and glucose transporter 4
(GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, an important organ for energy
expenditure (Figure 3). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence existed in
all genes between LF and HF groups. The mRNA expression
of PPARα for the HF/AP 5.0% group was signiﬁcantly
higher (1.5 times) than that for the HF group. In addition,
mRNA expression of PPARδ for the HF/AP 2.5% and HF/AP
5.0% groups was 1.8 and 2.0 times higher when compared
to the HF group. Moreover, AP signiﬁcantly increased
mRNA expression of CPT1, ACO and UCP3. In particular,
compared to the HF group, mRNA expression of UCP3 for
the HF/AP 2.5% and HF/AP 5.0% groups was about 2 and
3 times greater, respectively. AP administration increased
mRNA expression of GLUT4 (abundantly expressed inEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5

HF/AP 5.0% group was about double that for the HF group.
Protein expressions of CPT1, ACO and UCP3 were
quantiﬁed by western blotting, and AP administration
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of all proteins (Figure
4). These increases also correlated to increased mRNA
expressions.
3.5.mRNAExpressionintheLiver. Intheliver,expressionsof
fatty acid synthesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-
binding protein (SREBP)-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
and fatty acid synthase (FAS)), a fatty acid decomposition-
related gene (PPARα) and fat intake-related genes (PPARγ
and lipoprotein lipase (LPL)) were measured by real-time
RT-PCR (Figure 5). The mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c,
ACC and FAS were signiﬁcantly lower for HF/AP 2.5% and
HF/AP 5.0% groups than for the HF group. In addition,
mRNA expression of PPARα was signiﬁcantly higher for the
HF/AP2.5%andHF/AP5.0%groupsthanfortheHFgroup.
Furthermore, mRNA expressions of PPARγ and LPL, which
are related to liver fat accumulation, were signiﬁcantly lower
when compared to the HF group.
3.6. mRNA Expression in White Adipose Tissue. The mRNA
expressions of adipocytokines (adiponectin and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α), which are produced in white adi-
pose tissue and play important roles in obesity and diabetes,
and PPARγ were measured by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 6).
The results showed that mRNA expression of adiponectin
was signiﬁcantly lower for the HF group than for the LF
group, while mRNA expression of TNF-α was signiﬁcantly6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

higher. Conversely, mRNA expression of adiponectin was
signiﬁcantly higher for the HF/AP 2.5% and HF/AP 5.0%
groups in a dose-dependent manner when compared to the
HF group, but mRNA expression of TNF-α was signiﬁcantly
lower. In particular, expression of TNF-α was signiﬁcantly
lower for the HF/AP 5.0% group when compared to the LF
group. The mRNA expression of PPARγ for the HF group
was signiﬁcantly lower (about 90% lower) compared to the
LF group. AP administration signiﬁcantly accentuated this
decrease in mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.

investigated using KKAy mice as a model of obese type-II
diabetes.Whenfedanormaldiet,KKAymicedevelopobesity

used in studies on obesity and diabetes [34, 35]. AP was
found to signiﬁcantly suppress increases in body weight and
white adipose tissue weight, showing anti-obesity actions
(Table 2, Figure 1). HF also increased liver fat accumulation
and induced fatty liver, but AP administration lowered
fat accumulation, clarifying that AP suppresses fatty liver
(Table 2, Figure 2). Furthermore, measurements of plasma
GOT and GPT clariﬁed that AP suppressed fatty liver-
induced hepatopathy (Table 2). Plasma glucose and insulin
levels were signiﬁcantly higher for the HF group than for the
LF group, and severe type II diabetes was induced. AP sup-
pressed these increases in plasma glucose and insulin levels.
The HOMA-IR index, a simpler method to measure insulin
sensitivityusuallyusedinclinicalandanimalstudies[22,36],
was signiﬁcantly decreased in AP-treated groups compared
to the HF group, indicating that AP reduced hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia (Table 2). These ﬁndings clarify that
AP suppresses obesity and diabetes caused by a high-fat diet.
Obesity is caused by low energy expenditure and
increased fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrates and fat
intake by organs. Therefore, as well as the eﬀects of AP
on the expression of energy expenditure-related genes in
skeletal muscle and liver, eﬀects on the expression of genes
related to fatty acid synthesis and fat intake in the liver were
investigated.
In skeletal muscle, 7 weeks of AP administration
signiﬁcantly increased mRNA and protein expressions of
ACO, CPT1 (β-oxidation enzymes) and UCP3 (uncoupling
protein) compared to the HF group (Figures 3 and 4). AP
administration also increased mRNA expression of PPARα
and PPARδ (nuclear receptors). The mRNA expression of
PPARαincreasednotonlyinskeletalmuscle,butalsoinliver.
Activation and elevation of PPARα and PPARδ expression
is known to increase expression of CPT1, ACO and UCP3
to elevate energy expenditure, subsequently resulting in
anti-obesity actions [37–40]. This suggests that AP acts on
skeletal muscle and liver to increase energy expenditure.
Furthermore, AP decreased mRNA expression of ACC and
FAS, the rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid synthesis in the
liver, and mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, which controls the
expression of these enzymes [41]. Furthermore, AP lowered
the mRNA expression of PPARγ and LPL, which are related
to fat intake by the liver (Figure 5). Reduced expressions of
fatty acid synthetase [9], PPARγ [42, 43]a n dL P L[ 44]i n
the liver suppress the onset of obesity and fatty liver. These
ﬁndings indicate that the anti-obesity actions of AP are due
to increased expression of energy expenditure-related genes
in skeletal muscle and liver and decreased fatty acid synthesis
and fat intake in the liver.
Insulin resistance can be generated by decreased
adiponectin secretion and increased TNF-α secretion [45,
46]. AP increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and
decreased mRNA expression of TNF-α in white adipose
tissue (Figure 6). In white adipose tissue, AP administra-
tion signiﬁcantly increased (by about 5-fold) the mRNA
expression of PPARγ, which facilitates the expression of
adiponectin [47]. Furthermore, AP signiﬁcantly increased
the mRNA expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle
(Figure 3). GLUT4 is one of the glucose transporters that
are frequently expressed in skeletal muscle, and an increase
in GLUT4 expression has been known to reduce insulin
resistance [48]. AP thus reduces hyperglycemia and hyper-
insulinemia, not simply through alleviated obesity, but
through increased adiponectin secretion and suppressed
TNF-α secretion in white adipose tissue, and increased
GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle.
Various pharmacological actions of polyphenols have
been reported. The AP used in the present study acted on
skeletalmuscle,liver and whiteadipose tissueand wasshown
to possess anti-obesity and anti-diabetic actions (Figure 7).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9
While many studies have described plant extracts exhibiting
anti-obesity and anti-diabetic actions, to the best of our
knowledge, none have demonstrated anti-obesity and anti-
diabetic actions via the modiﬁcation of energy expenditure-
related genes in skeletal muscle. In recent years, selective
PPARδ agonists, such as synthetic GW501516, have been
shown to suppress body weight increase and reduce insulin
resistance in obese diabetic mice [37, 38]. The present study
suggests that AP is a plant extract with a novel mechanism of
action with skeletal muscle as an active site.
5. Conclusion
In KKAy mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity, the anti-
obesity actions of AP appear attributable to increased
expression of energy expenditure-related genes in skeletal
muscle and liver, and decreased fatty acid synthesis and
fat intake in the liver. AP also reduced hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia by increasing adiponectin secretion
and suppressing TNF-α secretion by white adipocytes, and
elevating the expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle in
addition to reducing obesity. In the future, AP seems to
oﬀer potential as a plant extract that is useful for alleviating
metabolic syndrome.
