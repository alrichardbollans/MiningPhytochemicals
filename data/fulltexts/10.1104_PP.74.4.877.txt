ABSTRACT
Soybean (Glycine max L.) strains which accumulate kaempferol 3-
(2G-glucosylgentiobioside) in their leaves fix CO2 at rates significantly
lower than those lacking this compound (Buttery, Buzzell 1976 Crop Sci
16: 547-550), and kaempferol aglycone is a well known inhibitor of
photosynthesis in vitro. However, since neither kaempferol nor any of
its glycosides could be detected in mesophyll cells isolated from mature
soybean leaves we suspect that kaempferol 3420-glucosylgentiobioside)
has no direct inhibitory effect on photosynthesis. The most rapid stage
of flavonoid accumulation, and the highest level of activity for several
enzymes of phenolic biosynthesis, occurs in leaflets 2.5 to 3 centimeters
long. Mesophyll cells isolated from these leaflets contain about 70% of
the whole leaf activity for shikimate dehydrogenase, 24% of the 4-
coumarate:CoA ligase activity, 35% of the activity for chalcone-flavanone
isomerase, but no demonstrable activity for phenylalanine ammonia-
lyase. Our results suggest a highly tissue-specific pattern of secondary
phenolic metabolism in soybean leaves.
Buttery and Buzzell (5) characterized 32 phenotypic classes of
soybeans based on patterns of kaempferol and quercetin glyco-
sides in whole mature leaves. Whenever genes Fgl and Fg3 were
present, the plants produced K9' and had reduced rates of
photosynthesis and yields (6, 7). The presence of this triglucoside
in recently expanded leaflets was associated with less Chl and
low photosynthetic rates (7).
The inhibitory effects of kaempferol aglycone on photosyn-
thesis in vitro are well characterized (2, 27), but its glycosides are
less effective (2). There are reports that flavonoid glycosides occur
in plastids isolated from several species (19, 26, 28, 29) including
soybean (26), but it is difficult to rule out plastid contamination
by vacuolar flavonoids during subcellular fractionation. Flavo-
noids are not detected in plastids isolated from some species (8,
26) and in spinach they can be essentially removed from the
plastid preparations by the use of Percoll gradients and PVP (8).
The plastid association of enzymes of phenolic biosynthesis is
also unresolved. For example, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase ac-
tivity has been reported in chloroplasts isolated from barley (25),
oats (29), and petunia (1), but was not detected in plastids isolated
from sweet clover (21) or in any particulate cytoplasmic fraction
obtained from leaves of pea, beans, or red cabbage (13). Activity
for this enzyme has been reported in some preparations of
spinach chloroplast ( 18) but not in others ( 13).
Recently developed techniques of tissue separation show that
the epidermis is often a major site for the accumulation of
flavonoids and other secondary metabolites. Flavonol glycosides
'Abbreviation: K9, kaempferol 3-(2-glucosylgentiobioside).
accumulate exclusively in the epidermis of pea leaves and are
not detected in underlying mesophyll cells (14). In contrast,
mesophyll protoplasts of oats can synthesize and accumulate
most of the flavonoids found in whole leaves (23).
The present study examines the accumulation of kaempferol
glycosides and the activity ofsome enzymes of their biosynthesis
in whole leaflets and in isolated mesophyll cells of soybeans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. Seeds of soybean
(Glycine max L.) strain OX-915 which produces a series of
kaempferol mono- and diglycosides, and strain OX-913 which
produces these flavonoids plus K9 (6), were a gift of B. R. Buttery
and R. I. Buzzell, Agriculture Canada, Harrow, Ontario. Plants
were grown in growth chambers under 40 Klux cool-white flu-
orescent light on a 16-h, 28°C day and an 8-h, 21 C night regime
and watered daily with full strength Hoagland nutrient solution
containing 50 mg/l Sequestrene 330 (CIBA Geigy). Fourth to
sixth trifoliates were obtained from 4- to 5-week-old plants grown
individually in 15 cm pots containing Metromix 300 (W. R.
Grace and Co., Cambridge, MA) and used to determine the
tissue distribution of flavonoids in mature leaves and changing
enzyme activities during leaf development. Mesophyll cells at
the highest stage of enzyme activity were isolated from 2.5 to 3
cm long first trifoliates of plants grown for 12 d on vermiculite
in 30 x 30 cm flats under the same growth conditions.
Chemicals. Macerase was purchased from Calbiochem-Behr-
ing and Pectolyase Y-23 from Sheishin Pharmaceutical Co.,
Tokyo, Japan. Avicel microcristalline cellulose TLC plates were
from Analtech Inc. ['4C]NaHCO3 and L-[U-'4C]phenylalanine
were from ICN. All other reagents were from Sigma Chemical
Co.
Cell Isolation. Cells were obtained from mature leaflets by
cutting 2 g of lamina into 1- to 2-mm strips and placing them in
a 10-cm Petri dish containing 25 ml of 20 mM Mes-KOH pH
5.8 with 0.3 M sorbitol, 1 mm CaClI, 2% (w/v) PVP-40, and 2%
(w/v) Macerase. Macerase was desalted prior to use by passing
10 ml of a 5% (w/v) solution in Mes buffer through a 1.5 x 20
cm Sephadex G-25 column. Fifteen ml were collected after VO
and used for cell isolation after dilution and addition of all other
components.
The preparation was vacuum infiltrated for 2 min and incu-
bated at 30°C for 90 min in the dark. The leaf strips were then
removed with needle-pointed forceps and the mesophyll cells
released by gently shaking the strips in a beaker containing 40
ml of wash medium. The wash medium, modified from Larsen
et al. (15), contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 0.2 M sorbitol, 5
mM KNO3, 2 mm CaCl., and 1 mM MgSO4. Isolated cells were
collected by filtration through a 70 jAm nylon mesh, pelleted by
centrifugation at 50g for 2 min, and resuspended in fresh wash
medium. Cell intactness was estimated by their ability to exclude
0.2% Evans Blue dye added to the wash medium.

COSIO AND MCCLURE
Cells were isolated from immature leaves 2.5 to 3 cm long by
substituting Pectolyase Y-23 (0.02% w/v) for Macerase and
supplementing the medium with 0.02% (w/v) BSA and 0.1%
(w/v) methylcellulose. The isolated cells were filtered through a
40-,um nylon mesh.
Determination of Flavonoids. Three whole leaflets were ground
in liquid nitrogen, extracted three times with methanol (5 ml/g
fresh weight), the combined extracts centrifuged, and the super-
natant filtered through a 0.45 Mm nylon-66 membrane. After
determining total Chl, the solution was concentrated to half its
original volume under a stream of N2 gas. A sample containing
20 to 30 Mg Chl was spotted onto a 20 x 20 cm Avicel TLC plate
(250 Mm coating) and developed in two dimensions using n-
pentanol, acetic acid, and water 20:12:10 (v/v/v) followed by 2%
aqueous formic acid in the second dimension (5).
Isolated mesophyll cells containing about 0.4 mg Chl were
pelleted by centrifugation and extracted three times with 5 ml of
methanol. The extracts were combined, concentrated to 5 ml,
Chl determined, and an aliquot containing 20 to 30 Mg Chl
spotted onto a TLC plate and developed as above.
Kaempferol glycosides were located on the chromatograms
under a long-wave UV lamp and the regions scraped from the
plate. Total kaempferol glycoside content was determined by
eluting the material with spectroscopic grade methanol, deter-
mining its absorption spectrum, and measuring the absorptivity
at 396 nm in sodium methoxide using a measured molar absorp-
tivity of 26.7 x 101. Recovery of the glycosides from TLC plates
averaged 50%, as determined by chromatography of the purified
standards. All values reported have been corrected accordingly.
Total kaempferol content was also determined by HPLC. For
this procedure the methanolic extracts were hydrolyzed with 1 N
HCI at 100C for 8 min to convert the glycosides to kaempferol
aglycone. Kaempferol was extracted from the reaction mixture
by phasing with two volumes of ethyl acetate, brought to dryness
by heating at 40°C under a stream of N2 gas, and taken up in 1
ml of tetrahydrofuran for HPLC examination. Separation was
accomplished under isocratic conditions on a 0.46 x 15 cm
Water's Resolve C18 column (5 Mm) using a solvent of 10%
aqueous acetic acid and tetrahydrofuran 65:35 (v/v) at a flow
rate of 0.6 ml/min at 3,000 p.s.i. The retention volume for
kaempferol aglycone was 7.5 ml. Kaempferol aglycone was quan-
titated by its absorption at 340 nm using a Water's Model 440
detector.
Prepartion of Samples for Enzyme Assays. From one to four
whole trifoliates were ground in a Tenbroeck homogenizer con-
taining 10 ml/g fresh weight cold 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8 and
4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and centrifuged at 30,000g for 15 min.
The supernatant was taken to 75% (NH4)2SO4 saturation and
centifuged for 10 min at 10,000g. The pellet was resuspended in
half the original volume of buffer and desalted on a Sephadex
G-25 column by the centrifugation technique ofNeal and Florini
( 17). Protein concentration was monitored throughout the puri-
fication procedure and recoveries averaged around 80%.
The procedure was simplified for the comparison of enzyme
activities in isolated cells with those ofwhole leaflets. The leaflets
were ground as described before and Chl concentration was
determined prior to centrifugation at 1,OOOg for 5 min. Five ml
of the resulting suernatant were desalted by centrifugation
through a 2 x 10 cm Sephadex G-25 column (17) and the eluate
used for enzyme assays. This step removed most of the presum-
ably phenolic material which caused high background absorb-
ance at wavelengths below 300 nm. Isolated mesophyll cells were
resuspended in borate buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, taken to
the same Chl concentration as the whole leaf homogenate and
disrupted by passing the suspension through a French pressure
cell at 440 kg cm2.
The cell lysates were slightly viscous and it was not possible to
separate soluble enzymes from the particulate material by either
Sephadex G-25 treatment, detergent treatment, centrifugation,
or protein precipitation. However, since the preparations had a
very high activity for mesophyll marker enzymes (Cosio, Ser-
vaites, and McClure, in preparation), and had a low background
absorbance below 300 nm, they were used directly as a source of
mesophyll cell enzymes.
Enzyme Assays. Unless otherwise indicated, enzymes were
assayed at 30°C in 2-ml reaction volumes using a Cary 210
spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cell
compartment. Reaction mixtures contained from 50 to 200 M1
of the enzyme preparations described above. It was necessary to
stir the reaction mixtures when using the pressure cell lysates in
order to prevent aggregation of the disrupted cell wall material.
Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) in whole leaflets was
determined by the technique ofHavir and Hanson (12) following
the increase in A290 of a reaction mixture containing enzyme, 90
mM Tris-HCI pH 9, and 20 mM L-phenylalanine. In isolated
mesophyll cells, a radiotracer assay containing 2 mM L-phenylan-
ine (14) was used. Shikimate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.25) was
assayed according to Balinsky and Dennis (3) by monitoring the
reduction of NADP+ at 340 nm in an assay mixture consisting
of enzyme, 70 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9.5, 3 mM shikimic acid,
and 88 gM NADP ; 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12) was
assayed by the technique of Gross and Zenk (10) following the
formation of the CoA ester by the increase in A333 of a mixture
containing enzyme 50 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2,
2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mM CoA, and 0.2 mM p-coumaric
acid. Blank rates were determined in the absence of CoA. Chal-
cone-flavanone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6) was assayed by the de-
crease in A370 using a modification ofthe technique ofHahlbrock
et al. ( 11) in an assay containing enzyme, 0.1 M K-phosphate pH
7.5, 5 mM KCN, and 33 Mm of 4,2',4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone.
The blank rate was determined in the absence of enzyme.
Carbon fixation by isolated cells was carried out in 3 ml glass
vials containing a 1-ml reaction mixture of wash medium, cells
with 25 Mg Chl, and 10 mM ['4C]NaHCO3 (0.1 MCi/Mmol). The
vials were placed in a Plexiglas water bath at 30°C and illumi-
nated from beneath with 10 Klux of cool-white fluorescent light.
Aliquots (0.2 ml) were taken at 10 and 20 min, placed in vials
containing 0.2 ml HCOOH, and the samples flushed with N2.
Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in
10 ml of Aquasol. Chl concentration was determined in metha-
nolic extracts at 650 and 665 nm using the coefficients given by
MacKinney (16). Protein was determined by Bradford's dye
binding technique (4) using Sigma fraction V BSA as a standard.
For all experiments the mean of at least four separate experi-
ments is reported.
RESULTS
Both strains, OX-913 and 915, showed similar growth rates
and developmental patterns under our experimental conditions.
The lengths of fully expanded central leaflets averaged 12 cm,
and mean fresh weight per trifoliate was 2.7 g. More than 80%
of the increase in length and 95% of the increase in fresh weight
took place during the last 8 d of leaf expansion in either experi-
mental strain (results not shown). Enzyme activities and levels
of flavonoid accumulation were closely related to the develop-
mental stage of the leaflets.
Figure 1 shows the level of total kaempferol glycosides in
whole trifoliates of OX-913 at various stages of development.
Approximately 74% of the total flavonoids accumulating in
recently matured leaflets of this strain is K9. Strain OX-915
produces quantitatively similar levels of total kaempferol glyco-
sides, but accumulates only mono- and diglycosides (data not
shown). While flavonoid accumulation in OX-913 levels off
when the lamina reach about 60% of their final length, deter-

mined as total kaempferol glycoside per g fresh weight, maximal
accumulation per trifoliate takes place during the final stages of
expansion (Fig. 1). The average content of total kaempferol
glycosides in fully mature leaflets of either strain averaged 2.4
.umol/g fresh weight (8 jmol per mature trifoliate, about 1.2
gmol/mg Chl) as determined from six separate experiments.
When mesophyll cells were isolated from recently matured
leaves, and samples with Chl content equivalent to that ofwhole-
leaf samples examined by TLC and spectroscopy or by HPLC,
they contained no traces of kaempferol or any of its derivatives.
By the TLC and spectroscopic technique we could detect total
kaempferol glycosides at levels as low as 0.05 ;tmol/mg Chl with
SE of±18%, HPLC analysis of the hydrolyzed samples increased
the sensitivity of detection to 0.04 Mmol kaempferol aglycone/
mg Chl with a SE of ±1.5%. As the whole leaflets contained 1.2
Amol kaempferol/mg Chl, no more than about 3% of the whole
leaf kaempferol glycosides could have accumulated in the mes-
ophyll and escaped detection by our techniques.
Examination of thin layer chromatograms of isolated cell
extracts under long-wave UV light disclosed several pale-blue
fluorescent compounds, presumably phenylpropanoids. This in-
dicates at least the accumulation ofother nonflavonoid phenolics
by mesophyll cells. These compounds were not further studied
for they were outside the scope of the present work.
Figure 2 shows that the activities of several enzymes of flavo-
noid biosynthesis change dramatically as the leaflets develop.
Shikimate dehydrogenase activity per g fresh weight decreases
about 70% as the leaflet expands from 2.5 to 12 cm in length,
but the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumar-
ate:CoA ligase and chalcone-flavanone isomerase decreases 90%
or more. As mesophyll cells isolated from mature leaves had
negligible activity for any of these enzymes, we focused our
attention on cells isolated from leaflets 2.5 to 3 cm long (20% to
25% final length). At this stage the leaflets have maximal enzyme
activity and this is the most rapid stage of flavonoid synthesis
per g fresh weight.
Table I compares enzyme activity in mesophyll cells with that
in whole leaflets. Mesophyll cells contained about 70% of the
shikimate dehydrogenase activity of the whole leaflet, but they
had only 24% of the 4-coumarate:CoA ligase activity, 35% of
the chalcone-flavanone isomerase activity, and no demonstrable
activity for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase by either the spectral
(data not shown) or the more sensitive radiotracer (Table I)
technique. The radiotracer assay should have detected the pro-
duction of trans-cinnamic acid at rates greater than 0.2 nmol/
min * mg Chl.
In six separate experiments we found that recently matured
leaves of the K9-producing strain OX-913 had about 25% less
Chl per unit leaf area than did the K9-free strain OX-9 15. While
intact leaves ofOX-9 13 are reported to have lower levels ofC02

is associated with low rates of photosynthesis (7), the absence of
this compound from the mesophyll seems to rule out its direct
intervention in the photosynthetic process.
We suspect that soybean flavonoids accumulate only in the
epidermis, as is the case in pea leaves (14), but we have been
unsuccessful in our attempts to prepare suitable epidermal peels
or epidermal protoplasts for examination from these strains of
soybeans.
DISCUSSION
Kaempferol glycosides are common in the leaves of vascular
plants, but K9 is known only from soybeans with the genotype
Fgl and Fg3. These codominant genes code for the addition of

glucose onto kaempferol 3-monoglucoside. Gene Fgl codes for a
( (1-6) linkage and Fg3 for a ,B (1-2) linkage (6). Members of
soybean isoline pairs which accumulate high levels of this
branched triglucoside have less Chl, lower whole leaf CO2 incor-
poration rates, and seed yields are about 50% lower than those
members which produce only kaempferol mono- and digluco-
sides. Fifteen other patterns of kaempferol or quercetin mono-
and diglycoside accumulation in soybean leaves have no appar-
ent effect on either photosynthesis or yield (7). Cultivar analysis
of commercial soybeans indicates that breeders have tended to
screen out those genotypes which would produce a high percent-
age of Fgl Fg3 recombinants (7).
As kaempferol is a potent inhibitor of photosynthesis in vitro
(2, 27), we suspected that K9 might also be inhibitory in vivo. In
an attempt to circumvent the problem of flavonoid contamina-
tion during chloroplast isolation (see "Introduction"), we exam-
ined whole mesophyll cells from soybeans to determine if the
kaempferol glycosides, especially K9, were present in this pho-
tosynthetic tissue.
Neither this compound nor any other flavonoids could be
detected in mesophyll cells isolated from either of the experi-
mental strains. Absence of this flavonoid from the mesophyll
seems to rule out any direct inhibition in photosynthesis. How-
ever, strain OX-913 which contains K9 does have about 25%
less Chl per unit leafarea than does strain OX-9 15. These isolines
are thought to differ only in their pattern of kaempferol glyco-
sides, thus the presence of K9 in the leaves of soybean hybrids
with the genotype Fgl-Fg3 may be a convenient phenotypic
marker, rather than a mediating compound, for some unchar-
acterized process which interferes with the plants Chl production,
photosynthetic ability, and yields.
The absence of flavonol glycosides from soybean mesophyll
cells does not rule out the involvement of this tissue in certain
steps of secondary phenolic biosynthesis. Intermediates might be
transported to other tissues at certain stages ofdevelopment and
synthesis of other classes of secondary phenolics may be taking
place in these cells. For example, the young mesophyll cells
contained appreciable activity for 4-coumarate:CoA ligase and
this enzyme is involved in the formation of the p-coumaric and
ferulic acid esters which accumulate in, and may regulate expan-
sion of, primary cell walls (9). Mesophyll cells also retain about
35% of the whole leaf activity for chalcone-flavanone isomerase
and this activity is associated specifically with flavonoid biosyn-
thesis. While apparent activity for chalcone-flavonone isomerase
can also be caused by oxidases not related to the flavonoid
pathway (14), many of those oxidases are inhibited by KCN
which we routinely included in our assay for this enzyme.
Recovery of 70% of the whole leaf activity for shikimate dehy-
drogenase in the mesophyll cells is not surprising since this
enzyme is associated with plastids.
The absence of detectable phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activ-
ity from the mesophyll is more difficult to reconcile, however,
since it initiates the pathway to all secondary phenolics. Phenyl-
alanine ammonia-lyase activity is present in mesophyll proto-
plasts isolated from oat (29), barley, tobacco, and sweet clover
(22). A parenchyma cell preparation from the leaves of pea was
reported to contain up to 80% of the phenylalanine ammonia-
lyase activity of the whole leaf (14), but that preparation also
included the vascular tissues and such lignifying tissues are
usually very high in activity for this enzyme (24). Chloroplast-
associated inhibitors of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase may have
interfered with detection of this enzyme in the crude pressure
cell lysates, but such inhibitors are usually most effective when
the preparation is treated with high levels of light in the presence
of sucrose (20) and neither of these conditions was present in
our experiments.
The absence of K9, a suspected inhibitor of photosynthesis,
from the mesophyll cells of soybeans demonstrates the impor-
tance of studying the tissue localization of flavonoids and other
secondary metabolites in any attempt to understand their roles
within the plant.
As flavonoids and other low mol wt secondary phenolics seem
to function primarily as protective agents against predators and
as precursors for lignin, suberin, and cutin, more attention needs
to be given to the contribution of the epidermis and the vascular
strands in the overall pattern of secondary phenolic biosynthesis
and accumulation. Extracellular transport of flavonoids is evi-
denced also by the numerous reports of flavonoids which accu-
mulate outside of living cells (30). With this in mind, we are
currently extending our work to the tissue-specific induction of
isoflavonoid phytoalexins in soybean leaves.
