  The anti-inflammatory effects of an ethanol extract of Angelica 
gigas (EAG) were investigated in vitro and in vivo using 
croton  oil-induced  inflammation  models.  Croton  oil  (20 
μg/mL) up-regulated mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase 
(COX)-I and COX-II in the macrophage cell line, RAW 
264.7,  resulting  in  the  release  of  high  concentrations  of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2). EAG (1∼10 μg/mL) markedly 
suppressed croton oil-induced COX-II mRNA expression 
and  PGE2  production.  Application  of  croton  oil  (5%  in 
acetone) to mouse ears caused severe local erythema, edema 
and vascular leakage, which were significantly attenuated 
by oral pre-treatment with EAG (50∼500 mg/kg). Croton 
oil dramatically increased blood levels of interleukin (IL)-6 
and PGE2 without affecting tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
and nitric oxide (NO) levels. EAG pre-treatment remarkably 
lowered IL-6 and PGE 2, but did not alter TNF-α or NO 
concentrations. These results indicate that EAG attenuates 
inflammatory responses in part by blocking the COX  򰠏 
PGE2  pathway.  Therefore,  EAG  could  be  a  promising 
candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Introduction 
Macrophages initiate specific immune responses against 
foreign antigens, and also release pro-inflammatory cytokines 
such as tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, 
IL-6 and others [10,13]. This process attracts an influx of 
lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and mast cells to 
the site of tissue damage, which leads to tissue healing and 
the removal of infectious agents. TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 
are pro-inflammatory cytokines that exert a multitude of 
biological activities linked to the immunopathology of 
acute or chronic inflammatory diseases [11,12].
TNF-α is a potent stimulator of inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) gene expression in certain cell types. It also 
induces the chemotaxis of neutrophils and T lymphocytes 
and the expressions of adhesion molecules [1,46]. IL-6 is a 
pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine produced by T lymphocytes, 
monocytes, macrophages and synovial fibroblasts and plays 
important roles in host defense, acute phase reactions and 
immune responses [44]. During inflammation, activated 
iNOS produces high concentrations of NO [1,46,48], a 
regulatory molecule that has diverse physiological functions 
such as vasodilatation [30,31]. 
Another major event during the inflammatory process is 
the arachidonic acid cascade, which is generated from 
membrane phospholipids by the actions of phospholipases. 
Arachidonic acid is degraded by cyclooxygenase (COX) to 
prostaglandins (PG), which act as major physiological 
regulators or inflammatory mediators [35]. COX-II is a 
cytokine-inducible enzyme responsible for releasing high 
concentrations of PGE2. Both NO and PGE2 are involved 
in pain induction and perception [17,35].
Although steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAID) are the major therapeutics used to treat 
inflammatory diseases, long term use of these drugs can 
cause adverse effects on the immune system, gastrointestinal 
tract, kidneys, liver, central nervous system, blood pressure 
and cardiovascular system [28,29,32]. Therefore, natural 
products with minimal adverse effects are necessary to either 
replace or be used in conjunction with chemical therapeutics 
to minimize unpredicted adverse effects.
The dried roots of Angelica gigas Nakai have been 
traditionally used in Oriental medicine not only for the 44    Sunhee Shin et al.
treatment of anemia and some circulatory disorders, but 
also as a sedative, an analgesic, and/or a tonic agent [21]. 
Recently, several coumarin derivatives, including decursins, 
decursinol, decursinol angelate, nodakenin, nodakenetin 
and umbelliferone, were isolated from Angelica gigas [6, 
22,26]. Pharmacological effects of these derivatives include 
anti-tumor activities [2,18,24], anti-platelet aggregation [27], 
Helicobacter pylori-suppression [3] and neuroprotection 
[23,47].
Earlier studies showed that another species of angelica, 
Angelica acutiloba Kitakawa (Japanese angelica), had analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory effects in rodents [7,43]. Next, decursinol 
from Angelica gigas was found to possess analgesic and 
anti-nociceptive activities [9,40]. More recently, decursin 
was shown to inhibit the induction of inflammatory mediators 
from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages 
[25]. Also, we previously demonstrated that an ethanol extract 
of  Angelica gigas (EAG) suppresses the carrageenan- 
induced inflammatory reaction by inhibiting the TNF-α 򰠏 
NO pathway [41].
In this study, we assessed the efficacy of EAG on ear 
inflammation induced by croton oil, a phorbol ester that 
triggers an inflammatory reaction in a different mode from 
carrageenan [41]. To elucidate the mechanism of action for the 
EAG, we analyzed the mRNA expression of COX enzymes 
and their byproduct, PGE2, in a macrophage cell line.
Materials and Methods
Materials
The root of Angelica gigas was purchased from an Oriental 
medicine market in Seoul, Korea in 2006. The plant 
materials were authenticated by an expert at Chungbuk 
National University. The dried root (5 kg) of Angelica gigas 
was extracted with ethanol in an ultrasonic apparatus. 
Upon removal of solvent under vacuum, the ethanol EAG 
yielded 500 g. The extract was dissolved in 50% ethanol, 
and orally administered at a dose of 4 mL/kg.
Cell culture and cytotoxicity of EAG
The murine RAW 264.7 cell line was purchased form the 
American Type Culture Collection (USA), and cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma, USA) containing 
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics [100 IU/mL penicillin 
(Sigma, USA) and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma, USA)]. 
The cells were incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere 
at 37
oC.
Cell viability after treatment with EAG was measured by 
the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, 
Japan) [20]. RAW 264.7 cells were suspended at a final 
concentration of 1 × 10
4 cells/well and cultured in a 96-well 
flat-bottomed microplate. After treatment with EAG (0.01∼
100 μg/mL), CCK-8 (10 μL) was added to each well containing 
cells in 100 μL of the culture medium, and the plate was 
incubated for 24 h at 37
oC. Viable cells were counted by 
absorbance measurements at 450 nm using a microplate 
reader. All experiments were performed in triplicate on 
three separate occasions.
Quantification of gene expression
The cells were pre-treated with EAG (1 or 10 μg/mL), and 
then stimulated with a combination of IFN-γ (10 IU/mL, 
Sigma, USA) and croton oil (20 μg/mL, Sigma, USA) for 
48 h. To identify the expression of COX mRNA, reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were 
performed. Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cells 
using the Trizol method (Invitrogen, USA). The cDNA 
was synthesized from RNA using the Improm-II Reverse 
Transcription System (Promega, USA) and oliogo dT 
primers for a total volume of 20 μL. PCR amplification 
was performed using the following primers (Bioneer, 
Korea): COX-I sense: 5´-CCGAGAAGTACTCATGCGC 
CTGGT-3´, COX-I antisense: 5´-CATCCTTGAAGAGC 
CGCAGGTGAT-3´, COX-II sense: 5´-CTGACCCACTT

CGAGCGTGGCTACAGC-3´, β-actin antisense: 5´-ACC 
GCTCATTGCCGATAGTG-3´.
For COX-II, the PCR procedures were carried out at the 
pre-heating condition of 94
oC for 2 min followed by 
denaturation at 94
oC for 30 sec, annealing at 58
oC for 30 
sec, extension at 72
oC for 30 sec for 30 cycles, and a final 
extension at 72
oC for 10 min. COX-I PCR procedures were 
carried out under identical conditions to that of COX-II, 
except annealing was set at 60
oC for 30 sec. The PCR 
products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 
ethidium bromide. The band intensities of the amplified 
DNAs were compared to the gel documentation system 
(MiniBLS Pro, Israel).
Measurement of PGE2
The culture supernatant was centrifuged at 30 × g for 20 
min, and the presence of PGE2 was detected using a 
Prostaglandin E2 Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, 
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Animals and treatment
Fifty male ICR mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from 
the Orient-Bio (Korea). The animals were housed at the 
Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chungbuk National 
University, Korea. The animals (n = 5/cage) were maintained 
in a room with a constant temperature of 22 ± 1
oC, relative 
humidity of 55 ± 10%, and 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed 
standard rodent chow (Samyang, Korea) and purified tap 
water ad libitum.
Mice (n = 10/group) were used after 1-week acclimation 
to the laboratory environment. The animals were orally 
administered EAG (50, 160 or 500 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive Anti-inflammatory effect of Angelica gigas ethanol extract    45

days. One h following the final administration, 50 μL of 
croton oil (5% in acetone) or its vehicle was applied to both 
surfaces of the ears [34].
All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance 
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23, 
revised in 1996; USA), and the protocol was approved by 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Laboratory 
Animal Research Center, Chungbuk National University 
(Korea).
Clinical examination
Five hours after croton oil application, the ears were scored 
for erythema according to a grading system [34], and then 
punctured with a cork borer (6 mm in diameter) and weighed. 
Separately, to quantify vascular leakage, some of the animals 
(n = 5/group) were intravenously injected with 5 mL/kg of 
Evan’s blue (1% in saline) immediately before croton oil 
application, and the ear tissues were punched out after 
transcardial perfusion with cold saline (100 mL/kg). Under 
anesthesia with diethyl ether, the left ventricle of mice was 
exposed, injected with a 23G needle connected to a bottle 
containing saline, and perfused in a flow rate of 1 mL/min 
[8]. Evan’s blue was extracted by immersing ear tissues in 
0.5 mL of formamide at 37
oC for 3 days, and quantified at 
620 nm.
Measurement of blood cytokines
Blood was collected from the abdominal vein of mice using 
a syringe with a 26G needle. The blood was allowed to clot 
at 4
oC and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 600 × 
g for 20 min. TNF-α and IL-6 were measured by mouse 
Quantikine immunoassay kits (R&D Systems, USA) using 
the ELISA procedures provided by the manufacturer 
(Molecular Devices, USA).
Measurement of blood PGE2 and NO
Serum concentration of PGE2 was measured as described 
above. The concentration of nitrite (NO2
-), the oxidized 
product of NO, was measured as an indicator of NO. Serum 
was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1% 
sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamide in 2.5% 
phosphoric acid) [16], and incubated at room temperature 
for 10 min. Nitrite concentration was analyzed at 540 nm, 
where NaNO2 was used to generate a standard curve.
Analysis of EAG ingredients
As described in previous reports [9,25,40], we analyzed the 
ingredients in EAG with a focus on coumarin derivatives 
including decursin and decursinol angelate using an HPLC 
device (Waters, USA). Chromatographic separation was 
achieved using ChemcoPak Chemcobond 5-ODS-H column 
(3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm internal diameter), and 2996 PDA 
photodiode detection was employed at a wavelength of 210 
nm. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (acetonitrile), 
solvent B (water), and solvent C (methanol) with the elution 
profile as follows: 0∼10 min, 20∼50% A (v/v, linear 
gradient), 70∼45% B (v/v, linear gradient), and 10∼5% C 
(v/v, linear gradient); 10∼40 min, 50∼45% A (v/v, linear 
gradient), 45∼50% B (v/v, linear gradient), and 5% C (v/v, 
isocratic elution); 40∼50 min, 45∼100% A (v/v, linear 
gradient), 50∼0% B (v/v, linear gradient), and 5∼0% C 
(v/v, linear gradient). The flow rate was 1 mL/min. For 
quantitative determination, the EAG extract was well 
separated under the optimized HPLC conditions mentioned 
above, and the concentrations of decursin and decursinol 
angelate were obtained from three independent analysis.
Statistical analysis
The results are presented as mean ± SE. Experimental 
group comparisons were made by one-way analysis of 
variance followed by a Dunnett’s t-test correction. A p 
value ＜ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
In a cell-level analysis, EAG was not cytotoxic when 
exposed up to 24 h at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 
10 μg/mL, but a significant cytotoxicity (＞ 70%) was 
observed at higher concentration (100 μg/mL, p ＜ 0.05). 
Because the toxicity of 100 μg/mL EAG was so large (IC50 
= 46.38 μg/mL), higher concentrations were not included 
in this study. 
Croton oil (20 μg/mL) up-regulated COX mRNA in RAW 
264.7 cells (Fig. 1). Interestingly, EAG markedly suppressed 
croton oil-induced up-regulation of COX-II mRNA in a 
concentration-dependent manner, resulting in full inhibition 
at a concentration of 10 μg/mL. Treatment with croton oil 
greatly increased PGE2 production from RAW 264.7 cells, 
which was almost completely reversed by EAG treatment 
at non-cytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 2).
Application of croton oil (5% in acetone) induced severe 
erythema, reaching a mean score of 4.5 (maximum score 5.0), 
which was remarkably attenuated by the oral administration 
of EAG (50∼500 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner 46    Sunhee Shin et al.

(Fig. 3A). Croton oil increased the ear weight and vascular 
leakage of Evan’s blue dye 1.9 and 22 fold of control levels, 
respectively (Figs. 3B and C). Such severe edema and 
vascular leakage were also significantly recovered by EAG 
pre-treatment.
In addition to local inflammation, croton oil application 
to ears also caused changes in blood cytokine and PG levels. 
Although croton oil did not influence the blood levels of 
TNF-α and NO, it increased IL-6 and PGE2 concentrations 
10 and 3 times over the control values, respectively (Table 1). 
However, EAG significantly lowered IL-6 and PGE2 
concentrations, which increased following croton oil 
application, without affecting the TNF-α and NO levels.
HPLC analysis of EAG revealed that decursin and decursinol 
angelate were the major ingredients of EAG, detected at 
25.6 and 26.5 min of retention time, respectively (Fig. 4A). 
The concentrations of decursin and decursinol angelate in 
the EAG extract were 53.10 ± 0.85 and 17.94 ± 0.19%, 
respectively (Fig. 4B). However, the contents of other coumarin Anti-inflammatory effect of Angelica gigas ethanol extract    47

Discussion
Using an in vivo ear inflammation model, croton oil was 
shown to induce severe erythema and edema, indicative of 
vascular leakage of serum contents as confirmed by Evan’s 
blue quantification. Among the diverse inflammatory mediators 
that can induce vascular permeability, it is well known that 
NO and PGE2 are major factors involved in the pathogenesis 
of many inflammation-associated diseases [14,38]. They 
are also known as mediators of pain induction and perception 
[17,35]. Therefore, TNF-α 򰠏 NO and COX-II 򰠏 PGE2 pathways 
have been considered as two main streams of inflammatory 
processes, which are blocked by inhibitors of iNOS 
(corticosteroids) and COX (NSAID), respectively [39,45]. 
In the present study, EAG significantly reduced erythema, 
edema and Evan’s blue leakage at doses of 50∼500 mg/kg, 
suggesting that it possesses suppressive activity against 
vascular permeability. In comparison with the maximum 
30% inhibition of the erythema score, edema (ear weight) 
improved up to 50% with EAG pre-treatment. The improvement 
of edema did not correlate with the dose-response effect on 
vascular (Evan’s blue) leakage, implying that a part of 
edema comes from tissue fluids other than serum, which 
might be also blocked by a low dose (50 mg/kg) of EAG.
In our previous study [41], we showed that carrageenan 
increased TNF-α and NO levels in air pouch exudate without 
affecting PGE2 concentration, which was later confirmed 
to be due to the suppression of COX mRNA expression by 
carrageenan (unpublished data). By comparison, croton oil greatly 
increased mRNA expression of COX, and consequently, 
PGE2 production from RAW 264.7 cells. Such results 
indicate that carrageenan and croton oil possess different 48    Sunhee Shin et al.
action mechanisms for inducing inflammatory reactions.
Notably, EAG exerted anti-inflammatory effects by blocking 
the TNF-α 򰠏 NO pathway, without influencing the PGE2 
level in a carrageenan-induced inflammation model [41]. 
In addition to the effects observed in the carrageenan model, 
the suppressive activity of EAG on iNOS mRNA expression 
was also confirmed in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells 
(unpublished results). These results were consistent with 
the effects obtained with corticosteroid treatment (i.e. 
dexamethasone), but not by NSAID treatment (i.e. 
indomethacin) [34,45]. However, from our follow-up study, 
it seemed that the effect of EAG on the COX-II 򰠏 PGE2 
pathway was masked by the blocking of COX mRNA 
expression by carrageenan. In the case of croton oil, the 
PGE2 level, which increased through up-regulation of COX, 
was markedly attenuated by EAG, suggesting that EAG is 
also a COX-II 򰠏 PGE2 pathway blocker. Interestingly, in 
this model, the TNF-α 򰠏 NO pathway was masked by croton 
oil (data not shown). Such effects of EAG on macrophages 
might be due to the inactivation of signaling within the 
cells. The observations that decursin blocks LPS-stimulated 
nuclear factor-κB activation and inhibits cholesteryl ester 
synthesis support this hypothesis [9,33]. Therefore, it is 
believed that EAG affects both major inflammatory pathways 
involving iNOS and COX-II as suggested in the carrageenan- 
induced paw edema model using Hwaotang, an Angelica 
gigas-containing medicinal formulation [37], although it 
also contained extracts of at least 7 other plant species.
Unlike TNF-α and NO, blood IL-6 and PGE2 also dramatically 
increased following topical exposure to croton oil; however, 
increases in IL-6 and PGE2 were markedly suppressed by 
EAG. IL-6 plays important roles in acute phase reactions 
[15,44] and immune responses, especially in autoimmune 
diseases, since it enhances B lymphocyte differentiation and 
immunoglobulin production, including IgE [36,44]. Thus, 
it appears that EAG selectively affects inflammatory cells, 
particularly the production of cytokines by these cells. Notably, 
it was confirmed that EAG potentially lowered the blood 
IgE concentration of mice exposed to dinitrofluorobenzene 
(DNFB), an allergic dermatitis model (unpublished results). 
It is of interest to note that EAG attenuated blood IL-6 levels, 
which increased following local (ear) inflammation induced 
by croton oil, thermal burn [42] and DNFB (unpublished 
results), but tissue IL-6 levels were not drastically increased 
by carrageenan [41]. This discrepancy may be due to the 
different effects of the inflammatory agents on immune 
cells, although their mechanisms of action on the immune 
system are still unknown.
The broad spectrum of pharmacological effects by Angelica 
gigas may result from its anti-inflammatory activities. Extracts 
of Angelica gigas and decursinol exhibited analgesic and 
anti-nociceptive activities in cytokine and acetic acid- 
induced pain models [14,40]. The pain induced by cytokines 
or acetic acid results from inflammatory responses related 
to NO and PG. In addition, the neuroprotective and memory- 
enhancing effects of Angelica gigas are also due to anti- 
inflammatory actions, since the neurotoxins, glutamate, 
kainic acid and β-amyloid peptide induce oxidative stress, 
which thereby cause memory impairment [23,26,47]. It 
was confirmed that EAG contains decursin and decursinol 
angelate, which might be the main active ingredients for 
the anti-inflammatory activities in croton oil- and carrageenan- 
induced inflammations [41].
Although defining the exact mechanism of action requires 
further study, EAG markedly attenuated inflammatory signs 
by blocking the COX-II 򰠏 PGE2 pathway in croton oil- 
induced inflammation. Furthermore, EAG also exerted anti- 
inflammatory activities against inflammation induced by 
carrageenan [41], thermal burn [42] and DNFB (unpublished 
results). These findings provide evidence that EAG could 
be a promising candidate or adjunct for the relief of various 
types of inflammation.
