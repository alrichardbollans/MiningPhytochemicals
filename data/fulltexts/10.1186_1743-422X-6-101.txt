Abstract
Background: Light-dependent activities against enveloped viruses in St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) extracts
have been extensively studied. In contrast, light-independent antiviral activity from this species has not been investigated.
Results: Here, we identify the light-independent inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by highly purified
fractions of chloroform extracts of H. perforatum. Both cytotoxicity and antiviral activity were evident in initial
chloroform extracts, but bioassay-guided fractionation produced fractions that inhibited HIV-1 with little to no
cytotoxicity. Separation of these two biological activities has not been reported for constituents responsible for the light-
dependent antiviral activities. Antiviral activity was associated with more polar subfractions. GC/MS analysis of the two
most active subfractions identified 3-hydroxy lauric acid as predominant in one fraction and 3-hydroxy myristic acid as
predominant in the other. Synthetic 3-hydroxy lauric acid inhibited HIV infectivity without cytotoxicity, suggesting that
this modified fatty acid is likely responsible for observed antiviral activity present in that fraction. As production of 3-
hydroxy fatty acids by plants remains controversial, H. perforatum seedlings were grown sterilely and evaluated for
presence of 3-hydroxy fatty acids by GC/MS. Small quantities of some 3-hydroxy fatty acids were detected in sterile
plants, whereas different 3-hydroxy fatty acids were detected in our chloroform extracts or field-grown material.
Conclusion: Through bioguided fractionation, we have identified that 3-hydroxy lauric acid found in field grown
Hypericum perforatum has anti-HIV activity. This novel anti-HIV activity can be potentially developed into inexpensive
therapies, expanding the current arsenal of anti-retroviral agents.

Background
The aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's
wort) have been used both historically and in modern
times to treat various medical conditions, including
depression, cancer, wounds, microbial infections and
inflammation [1-9]. Hypericum perforatum is known to be
rich in naphthodianthones, phloroglucinols and fla-
vanoids [10]. Reported biological activities have been
associated primarily with the naphthodianthones, hyper-
icin and pseudohypericin, several flavanoids and the
phloroglucinols, hyperforin and adhyperforin [1,11].
Recently, it has been suggested that synergy between the
metabolic constituents is responsible for the anti-depres-
sive activity of the extract [1].
The constituents hypericin and pseudohypericin effec-
tively inhibit infection by a number of enveloped viruses
of medical importance, including human immunodefi-
ciency virus-1 (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and
influenza A virus [12-15]. These inhibitory activities are
light-dependent, which has lead to innovative strategies
for delivering these compounds with bursts of light in vivo
[16]; however, the need for light to activate hypericin
remains problematic for many practical applications.
Hypericin also has light-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
[2,17,18]. Cytotoxicity may stem in part from hypericin
eliciting rapid loss of mitochondrial potential [18]. Pho-
tocytotoxicity was responsible for the premature termina-
tion of a clinical trial that tested the efficacy of hypericin
against HIV in AIDS patients [19].
Identification of additional anti-HIV therapies is needed
as viral resistance to current drugs continues to develop.
While botanicals have generally been a rich source of
medicinal compounds, identification of botanically-
based antivirals has been limited. Here, we sought to
determine if light-independent anti-HIV activities are
present in the constituent-rich species, H. perforatum.
These studies were performed with chloroform extracts of
aerial material, leading to the removal of most of the well
characterized metabolites, including light-dependent
hypericin [17]. Using bioactivity-driven fractionation of
chloroform extracts, we were able to identify novel com-
pounds having anti-HIV activity.
Results
Inhibition of HIV infection by chloroform extracts
Inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity by light-dependent constit-
uents found in H. perforatum is well established, but these
same compounds have extensive cellular cytotoxicity and
require a light source for activation, thereby reducing their
potential value as clinical antiviral therapeutics [16,20-
22]. To determine if light-independent anti-HIV activity is
also present in H. perforatum extracts, we began by extract-
ing dried aerial material with chloroform. Chloroform
was selected for the extraction solvent rather than ethanol
as chloroform does not extract the light-dependent naph-
thodianthones or phloroglucinols [17,23]. Specifically,
hypericin and pseudohypericin that were readily detected
in ethanol extracts generated from the same plant samples
were not detectable in these chloroform extracts [17,24].
As variation in constituent concentration and composi-
tion has been noted in different varieties of H. perforatum
[25,26], we tested the ability of several accessions and
commercial varieties to inhibit HIV infection (Fig. 1). Par-
allel cytotoxicity studies were performed to determine cell
viability. Chloroform extracts of H. perforatum cultivars
'Common' and 'Medizinal' and accession PI 371528 had
consistent, detectable inhibition against HIV at a concen-
tration of 2 μg/ml. The impact of the extracts on cell via-
bility was modest at these same concentrations. However,
profound loss of cell viability was observed in wells
treated with 10 μg/ml of extract and, while HIV infection
was also inhibited at these higher concentrations, the loss
of the cell monolayer is likely to be partially responsible
for lower numbers of infected cells that were observed.
Extract fractionation separated cytotoxicity from the anti-
HIV activity
Fractionation of the chloroform extract was undertaken to
determine if the antiviral activity could be separated from
the cytotoxic activity observed in the extracts. We selected
H. perforatum 'Common' for these fractionation studies.
The extract initially was partially purified by column chro-
matography intended to generate groups of compounds
to minimize the total number of bioassays necessary to
identify active components. Initial fractions were assayed,
active ones were further fractionated, and the cycle was
repeated (Fig. 2). This process was guided by considering
both cytotoxicity and inhibition of HIV infectivity. Evi-
dence that separate constituents were responsible for
these two biological activities was demonstrated follow-
ing silica gel chromatography fractionation of fraction E
using increasingly more polar solvents (Fig. 3a). The larg-
est levels of cytotoxicity were observed in subfractions that
were eluted under the most non-polar solvent conditions,
whereas inhibition of HIV infectivity in the absence of cell
cytotoxicity was evident in subfraction E4 that was eluted
with a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile/methanol.
Subsequent fractionation of E4 into eight subfractions
was performed by using an initial elution solution of 5%
methanol/95% acetonitrile to elute E4.1 evolving to
100% methanol that eluted E4.8. All subfractions were
evaluated for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity at 10 and
100 μg/ml. In subfractions E4.5 through E4.8 at a concen-
tration of 10 μg/ml, antiviral activity was observed with
negligible loss of cell viability (Fig. 3b). At a concentration
of 100 μg/ml, significant cytotoxicity was observed in allVirology Journal 2009, 6:101 http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/101

E4 subfractions; however, that observed in E4.7 was less
than levels found in the others. The distribution of cyto-
toxicity across the elution gradient suggested that multiple
compounds were present in the E4 subfraction that
affected cell viability. Subfractions E4.7 and E4.8 were
then subfractionated by using a reverse phase HPLC gradi-
ent, and six subfractions from each were collected and
analyzed. Anti-HIV activity was lost during the E4.8 sub-
fractionation (data not shown). However, anti-HIV activ-
ity was detected in subfractions E4.7b-e, and limited
cytotoxicity was found in these subfractions (Fig. 3c). A
dose-response curve from 3 to 100 μg/ml of E4.7d dem-
onstrated antiviral activity with 50% inhibition of HIV
(IC50) at a concentration of 27.6 μg/ml and an IC90 of 70.8
μg/ml (Fig. 3d). The E4.7d dose-response curve was per-
formed in low light conditions under which the antiviral
activity of any trace hypericin would not be activated
(data not shown). Both the separation of antiviral activity
from the cytotoxicity and the absence of light dependence
of the antiviral activity argue that these fractions contain
previously unidentified constituents that differ from
known H. perforatum antiviral compounds such as hyper-
icin.
Analyses of compounds present in active fractions
To determine the chemical composition of the bioactive
fraction E4.7, and two bioactive subfractions E4.7c and
E4.7d, these samples were analyzed by using gas chroma-
tography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As a control, sub-
fraction E4.7f that contained cytotoxic activity, but no
detectable antiviral activity, was analyzed in parallel. This
analysis reveals that fraction E4.7 was a relatively complex
mixture of metabolites (Fig. 4a), whereas all three subfrac-
tions were predominantly composed of a single metabo-
lite that appeared to constitute about 80–90% of the
detectable mass in each fraction (Fig. 4b–d). The chemical
identity of these three major metabolites was determined
based upon the fragmentation pattern obtained with
mass-spectrometry (Fig. 5), and by comparing the chro-
matographic behavior of each metabolite with respect to
authentic standards. These analyses identified the princi-
pal metabolites as 3-hydroxy lauric acid, 3-hydroxy myris-
tic acids and 3-hydroxy palmitic acid in subfractions
E4.7c, E4.7d and E4.7f, respectively (Fig. 4 and 5).
Ability of a synthetic 3-hydroxy fatty acid to inhibit HIV 
infectivity
3-hydroxy lauric acid, the principal component of sub-
fraction E4.7c, was synthesized. Evaluation of this com-
pound in our HIV-inhibition assay demonstrated that
relatively high concentrations (~10 μM and higher) of 3-
hydroxy lauric acid inhibited HIV infectivity in a dose-
dependent manner in the absence of detectable cytotoxic-
ity (Fig. 6). The GC-MS analysis suggested that the concen-
tration of 3-hydroxy lauric acid in fraction E4.7c was
approximately 95 μM indicating that concentrations of
this fatty acid in the subfraction were well within the
range of active anti-HIV concentrations. These findings

led us to conclude that it is likely that 3-hydroxy lauric
acid present in E4.7c was at least partially responsible for
the anti-HIV activity that we observed. The finding that
our highly purified fractions were more inhibitory than
pure 3-hydroxy lauric acid suggested the possibility that
additional constituents present in the subfractions may
contribute to the antiviral activity.
3-hydroxy-fatty acids can be detected in sterile H. 
perforatum seedlings
3-hydroxy fatty acids, such as 3-hydroxy lauric acid, 3-
hydroxy myristic acid and 3-hydroxy palmitic acids, occur
as natural intermediates of de novo fatty-acid biosynthesis,
acylated to the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of
acyl-carrier protein (ACP). However, these hydroxylated
fatty acids are not known to normally accumulate to high
levels in plants. Rather the most abundant hydroxylated-
fatty acids that accumulate to readily detectable levels in
plants carry the hydroxyl group at the 2-position, the 9-
position or the omega position of the acyl chain, and
these are components of ceramides, cutin and suberin. On
the other hand, such 3-hydroxy-fatty acids are a major
component of Lipid A, a component of the lipopolysac-
charide cell wall of gram-negative bacteria [27]. Although
there have been many suggestions that Lipid A-like mole-
cules may exist in plants [28], this is not a universally
accepted concept. Therefore, it is formally possible that
the 3-hydroxy-fatty acids that were recovered in subfrac-
tions E4.7c, E4.7d and E4.7f may in fact be extracted from
bacteria present in the field-grown H. perforatum tissue,
which was the starting material for the bioactivity-based
fractionation.

To test this possibility, we aseptically grew H. perforatum
seedlings, and extracted and analyzed fatty acids from this
sterile material. Fatty acids were extracted from 4-week-
old sterile plants following the barium hydroxide hydrol-
ysis of all acylated-lipids, and the recovered fatty acids
were silylated and analyzed by GC-MS. For comparison,
we also analyzed the fatty acids present in leaves from
field-grown H. perforatum plants and fatty acids present in
the original chloroform extract that was used to generate
subfractions E4.7c and E4.7d. We were able to detect
small quantities of 3-hydroxy myristic acid (Fig. 7, peak 2)
in field-grown plant material (0.9 mole % of all detected
fatty acids) and in the chloroform extract (0.3 mole % of
all detected fatty acids), but this fatty acid was not detect-
able in the fatty acids extracted from H. perforatum seed-
lings grown under sterile conditions. Instead, we detected
small quantities of 3-hydroxy palmitic acid in the sterile
plants (Fig. 7, peak 4); however, this peak was not
detected in the field-grown material. Thus, our analyses
suggest that 3-hydroxy fatty acids are synthesized by H.
perforatum and can be detected, but quantities of these
fatty acids appear to be at the limit of detection in the ini-
tial extracts. Using our bioactivity-guided fractionation
approach, we were able to identify subfractions that were
predominately composed of these fatty acids. In addition,
our findings suggest the possibility that growth conditions
may influence the production of these fatty acids by
Hypericum. These studies do not provide conclusive evi-
dence as to the source of the 3-hydroxy fatty acids in our
highly purified fractions, leaving open the possibility that

leaves of the plant are responsible for their production.
Specificity of anti-HIV activity
We sought to determine the breadth of the antiviral activ-
ity we had found in the E4.7 and E4.8 subfractions. We
tested them for antiviral activity against the distantly
related lentivirus, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV),
in highly permissive equine dermis cells. No inhibition of
EIAV infectivity was observed with addition of either E4.7
or E4.8 (Fig. 6). Higher doses of E4.7 were more cytotoxic
to ED cells than that observed in our HIV studies in
HeLa37 cells. These studies led us to conclude that these
subfractions contain constituents including 3-hydroxy
lauric acid that specifically target HIV and are not broadly
inhibitory against other members of the lentiviral sub-
family of retroviruses.
Discussion
Here we identify novel, light-independent anti-HIV activ-
ity in extracts generated from field-grown H. perforatum.
This activity was found in chloroform extracts that do not
contain the previously characterized light-dependent anti-
viral agents hypericin or pseudohypericin. Following
extensive fractionation, we were able to separate the light-
independent antiviral and cytotoxic activities, indicating
that separate constituents are responsible for these activi-
ties. During the subfractionation process, the anti-HIV
activity was found in the more polar fractions, whereas
cytotoxic activities were distributed throughout the gradi-
ents. Upon GC/MS analysis of our most highly purified
subfractions, two related 3-hydroxy-fatty acids, 3-hydroxy
lauric acid and 3-hydroxy myristic acid, were found to be
the most abundant compounds in the active subfractions
E4.7c and E4.7d, respectively. These same fractions con-
tained the most pronounced anti-HIV activity with mini-
mal cytotoxicity. Synthetic 3-hydroxy lauric acid had

mentation indicated in each structure.

significant inhibitory activity against HIV, suggesting that
this compound was responsible for the antiviral activity
observed in the E4.7c subfraction. Interestingly, subfrac-
tion E4.7f contained abundant 3-hydroxy palmitic acid.
Substantial cytotoxicity was found in this subfraction and
little or no anti-HIV activity was evident. This finding sug-
gested that the length of the carbon chain impacts the bio-
logical activity of various 3-hydroxy fatty acids. Consistent
with this possibility, shorter-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids
that were synthesized and tested in parallel with 3-
hydroxy lauric acid were not found to contain anti-HIV
activity (data not shown).
Synthesis and accumulation of 3-hydroxy fatty acids by
plants has been suggested in the literature [28]. Lipid A
that contains 3-hydroxy fatty acids was recently identified
in green algae [29]. The angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana is
known to contain all of the genes required to synthesize
Lipid A [30], suggesting that higher plants may also gener-
ate these fatty acids. In our studies, small quantities of 3-
hydroxy myristic acid were detected in sterile seedlings,
indicating that some 3-hydroxy fatty acids are indeed syn-
thesized by Hypericum  at least at some developmental
stages. It is not clear how much of a contribution these
endogenous 3-hydroxy fatty acids have towards the fatty
acids found in our highly purified subfractions. Lipopoly-
saccharide from colonizing bacteria on field-grown plants
may also be responsible for the presence of these fatty
acids in our fractions.
3-hydroxy fatty acids have not been previously reported to
have inhibitory activity against HIV. Furthermore,
although these 3-hydroxy fatty acids comprise the fatty-
acid chains of endotoxin from a number of human path-
ogens, individual, single-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids bind
poorly to the cellular protein MD-2 [31,32], do not elicit
activation of macrophages through TLR4 [33,34] and are
thought to contain little or no innate biological activity
[33]. Here, we provide evidence that one or more of these
3-hydroxy fatty acids potentially can serve as a therapy
against HIV. This inhibitory activity appears to be specific
for HIV, as inhibition was not observed against the dis-
tantly related lentivirus, EIAV. Which step or steps within
the HIV life cycle that are targeted by these fatty acids
remain to be determined.

ric acid were incubated with HIV and added to HeLa37 cells. 
At 40 h following infection, cells were fixed and evaluated for 
HIV antigen staining. The cellular cytotoxicity of 3-hydroxy 
lauric acid was evaluated in parallel, in the absence of HIV. 
The findings are shown as percent control values (the cyto-
toxicity or number of HIV antigen-positive cells in the pres-
ence of the various concentrations of 3-hydroxy lauric acid

In addition to the anti-HIV activity, chloroform extracts
also had significant cytotoxicity. Our studies suggest that
there are multiple constituents present in the chloroform
extracts that were responsible for this activity. For
instance, subfractions of E4 that negatively affected cell
viability eluted in a range of solvent conditions from 95%
acetonitrile/5% methanol to 100% methanol. The broad
range of solvent conditions that yielded fractions with
cytotoxicity strongly implicates different constituents with
varied polar characteristics. Reduced cell viability may be
a result of induction of cell death and/or cessation of cell
division. Clearly at high concentrations of the chloroform
extracts, loss of cell viability was evident, since some
extracts caused the loss of more than 90% of the cell mon-
olayer. However, in some subfractions, such as E4.7,
where cell viability was reduced by 20 to 30%, it is possi-
ble that the constituents had cytostatic activity. Future
studies will be needed to determine which of these mech-
anisms is responsible for cytotoxicity and to identify spe-
cific constituents responsible for the activity.
Several light-independent cytotoxic constituents have
been previously identified in H. perforatum. Hyperforin
and procyanidin B2 have been shown to have cytotoxic
activities in several cell lines [35,36]. However, neither of
these compounds are found in chloroform extracts [23].
Additionally, uncharacterized H. perforatum lipophilic
metabolites have been shown to have cytotoxic activities
[23]. As lipophilic constituents might be expected to be
present in chloroform extracts, these compounds may be
responsible for some or all of the cytotoxicity observed.
In summary, we have successfully identified a new anti-
HIV compound through bioguided fractionation of chlo-
roform extracts of Hypericum perforatum. Our biological
assay was sufficiently sensitive to allow detection of mod-
est levels of antiviral activity that were present in the ini-
tial chloroform extract. Through the purification steps, the
antiviral activity became readily apparent. Our findings
implicate 3-hydroxy fatty acids in the antiviral activity.
These may be endogenous to Hypericum or a result of bac-
terial growth on the field-grown plants.
Materials and methods
Growth of H. perforatum varieties and accessions
Plant Material
Hypericum field plots were established at the USDA-ARS
North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station
(NCRPIS) in Ames, Iowa. Three commercial cultivars and
two unimproved populations of Hypericum perforatum
were evaluated in this experiment. The 'Common' cultivar
(Ames 28320, supplier's lot 16333) was obtained from
Johnny's Selected Seeds (Winslow, ME), a seed company
specializing in organic seeds, and the other cultivars,
'Helos' (Ames 27453, NCRPIS lot 04ncao01) and 'Mediz-
inal' (Elixir™) (Ames 27452, NCRPIS lot 04ncao01), were
grown from seeds supplied by Richter's Herb Specialists
(Goodwood, ON, Canada). The cultivar 'Medizinal' was
bred to contain a higher amount of napthodianthrones,
and 'Helos' was bred for tolerance to anthracnose disease
[6]. Two unimproved populations from the former Soviet
Union, PI 325351 (NCRPIS lot 85ncab01) and PI 371528
(NCRPIS lot 75ncai01) were obtained from the NCRPIS,
a public germplasm collection.
Plant Production
Seeds were germinated in petri dishes. After germination,
seedlings were transferred to plastic trays (72 plugs/tray)
containing Sunshine LC-1 Mix™(Sun-Gro Horticulture,
Bellevue, WA). These seedlings were transplanted into
field plots on 11 June 2003, at 118 days after seeding, at a
plant height of 6 to 10 cm.
Plant Harvest
Material of 'Common' used in the fractionation studies
was harvested on 23 July 2004, when plants were at 50%
flowering. The studies that assessed the antiviral activity
and cytotoxicity associated with chloroform extracts from
several H. perforatum cultivars and accessions used plant
material that was harvested on 16 June 2005, also at 50%
flowering. Three plants per plot were harvested by cutting
aerial parts 30.5 cm above the soil surface and placing
them in mesh bags. Bags were placed in drying racks with
forced air at 40°C for 8 days [37]. After the aerial parts
were completely dry, dry weights were taken and tops
were ground through a 40-mesh screen in a Wiley grinder.
The infectivity of the lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus  (EIAV) is not inhibited by H. perforatum subfractions E4.7 or  E4.8 Figure 8
The infectivity of the lentivirus equine infectious ane-
mia virus (EIAV) is not inhibited by H. perforatum 
subfractions E4.7 or E4.8. The subfractions were incu-
bated with EIAV and added to ED cells (MOI = 0.005). Cul-
tures were fixed at 40 h following infection and cells 
immunostained for EIAV antigens. Cytotoxicity of the sub-
fractions on ED cells was performed in parallel, in the 
absence of EIAV. All data are shown as percent of control 
values.

Extraction of H. perforatum aerial material
For the studies that investigated antiviral activity associ-
ated with the extracts, 6 g of dried plant material from
each cultivar or accession was chloroform extracted and
dried by rotary evaporation. For the fractionation studies,
450 g of ground aerial parts of H. perforatum 'Common'
were extracted with chloroform by Soxhlet extraction for
6 h. The extract was dried by rotary evaporation to yield a
total of 64.93 g of material.
Fractionation of chloroform extracts
The crude extract (23.6 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (150
mL) and activated charcoal was added. After filtration, the
filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was
placed on a short (~5 cm) silica column. Sequential elu-
tion with hexane (2 L), CHCl3 (4 L), and CH3OH (1 L)
afforded three fractions that were concentrated in vacuo
and subjected to bioassay. The active methanol fraction
(7.1 g) was dissolved in 50:50 CH3CN:CH3OH and then
subjected to column chromatography (3 cm, 180 cm3 of
silica). Sequential elution with 50:50 CH3CN:CHCl3 (600
mL), CH3CN (400 mL), 90:10 CH3CN:CH3OH (400 mL),
50:50 CH3CN:CH3OH (500 mL) gave four fractions (E1,
3.5 g; E2, 0.5 g; E3, 1.1 g; and E4, 2.0 g; ~100% recovery).
After bioassay, the active fraction E4 (1.97 g) was sub-
jected to column chromatography (3 cm, 100 cm3 silica).
The fraction was dissolved in 5 mL 95:5 CH3CN:CH3OH
and eluted with a step gradient consisting of 400 mL each
of (95:5, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 0:100
CH3CN:CH3OH) affording eight new fractions (E4.1, 230
mg; E4.2, 240 mg; E4.3, 260 mg; E4.4, 240 mg; E4.5, 250
mg; E4.6, 140 mg; E4.7, 110 mg; E4.8, 90 mg; ~79%
recovery). After bioassays revealed activity, samples E4.7
and E4.8 were further fractionated by reverse phase HPLC
on a preparative scale C18 column. Samples E4.7 and
E4.8 each were dissolved in 1:1:1:3
CH3CH2OH:CHCl3:H2O:CH3OH (3 mL), and purified by
HPLC with a gradient elution (Solvent A. 10 mM aq
NH4OC(O)CH3, Solvent B. 9:1 CH3CN:CH3OH). A gradi-
ent of 3% B:A to 100% B was used for sample E4.7, and a
gradient of 15% B:A to 100% B was used for sample E4.8.
The flow rate was set at 3 mL/min and tubes were col-
lected every 45 sec. After concentration, 6 subfractions
were obtained from each sample (E4.7a, 17 mg; E4.7b, 9
mg; E4.7c, 13 mg; E4.7d, 7 mg; E4.7e, 6 mg; E4.7f, 6 mg;
~54% total recovery) and (E4.8a, 34 mg; E4.8b, 8 mg;
E4.8c, 3 mg, E4.8d, 4 mg; E4.8e, 4 mg; E4.8f, 4 mg; ~70%
total recovery). These fractions were assayed as described
above.
Cell lines
HeLa37 cells were used for HIV studies [38]. This HeLa
cell line expresses both CD4 and CXCR4 ectotopically and
are permissive for HIV strains that use CCR5 or CXCR4 for
entry. HeLa37 cells were maintained in high glucose
DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and pen/strep. Equine
dermis cells (ED cells)(ATCC CCL57) used for the EIAV
studies were also maintained in high glucose DMEM with
10% fetal calf serum and pen/strep.
Generation of viral stocks
HIV
Stocks of HIV-1 were generated by transfecting a 150 cm
plate of 80% confluent HEK 293T cells with 75 μg of the
HIV molecular clone pNL4-3 by using the CaPO4 proce-
dure [39]. Supernatants were collected at 48-h post-trans-
fection, clarified to remove cell debris and frozen at -80°C
until needed. Virus production was assessed by reverse
transcriptase activity in the viral stocks and by the single
round of infection assay in HeLa37 cells described below.
RT assays were performed as previously described [40].
EIAV
Viral stocks of EIAVMA-1 were produced in ED cells. Super-
natants were harvested from cells that were >95% positive
for EIAV antigen as determined by EIAV antigen immu-
nostaining. Supernatants were centrifuged for 5 min at
13,500 × g to remove cell debris, aliquoted, and frozen at
-80°C until needed. Viral titers were determined by infec-
tion of ED cells by using the single round of infection
assay described below.
Viral-infection studies
HIV studies
All extracts or fractions were resuspended in DMSO. 2.5 ×
102 infectious particles of HIV (MOI = 0.01) were com-
bined with the concentrations of extracts or fractions
noted in the figures. The amount of DMSO was adjusted
so that equivalent concentrations of DMSO were used in
all wells. No more than 0.5% DMSO was used, as HeLa37
cytotoxicity was observed at higher DMSO concentra-
tions. The extract and HIV mixture was added to 2.5 × 104
cells/well of HeLa37 cells in a 48-well format. The cells
were maintained for 40 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.
Cells were fixed in 75% acetone/25% water and immu-
nostained for HIV antigens with human anti-HIV antisera
(1:500) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (1:500). 3-amino-9ethyl-carbazole was used as the
horse radish peroxidase substrate. Plates were dried and
wells were counted for the number of HIV antigen-posi-
tive cells. Numbers of HIV antigen-positive cells in the
presence of extract, fraction or fatty acid were divided by
the number of HIV antigen-positive cells present in con-
trol wells that did not contain extracts, and these values
are expressed as % control.
EIAV studies
All studies were performed in ED cells. All extracts or frac-
tions were resuspended in DMSO. 2.5 × 102 infectious
particles of EIAV were combined with the concentrationsVirology Journal 2009, 6:101 http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/101
Page 10 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)
of extracts or fractions noted in each experiment. The
amount of DMSO was adjusted so that equivalent concen-
trations of DMSO were used in all wells. No more than
1% DMSO was used, as ED cell cytotoxicity was observed
at higher DMSO concentrations. The extract and virus
mixture was added to 5 × 104 cells/well of ED cells in a 48-
well format to yield a MOI of ~0.005. The infections were
maintained for 40 h. Cells were fixed with75% acetone/
25% water at 40 h following initiation of the infection,
and anti-EIAV immunostaining of the cells was performed
as previously described [41]. The EIAV antigen-positive
cells within the monolayer were enumerated. Numbers of
EIAV antigen-positive cells in the presence of the fractions
were divided by the number of EIAV antigen-positive cells
present in control wells that did not contain extracts, and
these values were expressed as % control.
Cell-viability studies
ED or HeLa37 cells were plated and treated with extracts,
fractions or fatty acid as described above. Cell viability
was monitored at 40 h after treatment initiation by
ATPLite Assay (Packard Biosciences) per manufacturer's
instructions.
Aseptic growth of H. perforatum seedlings
Hypericum perforatum (Accession Ames 28320, lot
06ncao01) seeds were surface sterilized by treating for 7
min with a solution consisting of 50% (v/v) Bleach and
0.05% (v/v) TritonX-100. After washing the seeds 3 times
with sterile water, the seeds were placed on sterile wet 3
MM Whatman paper filters in sterile Petri plates. After ger-
mination, seedlings were aseptically transferred to indi-
vidual Magenta boxes containing 25 ml of sterile 1% agar
prepared in 1× Murashige & Skoog Basal Medium con-
taining Gamborg Vitamins with macro and micronutri-
ents (PhytoTechnology lab) Boxes were placed in a
growth room maintained at 21°C, and under a 16-h light
cycle, illuminated at 50 mmol m-2 s-1.
Lipid extraction
Lipid-bound fatty acids were extracted by a modification
of a previously published method [42]. Approximately
0.1 g fresh weight of aerial tissue or 0.05 g of root tissue,
from 4-week-old H. perforatum plants, spiked with a
known quantity of nonadecanoic acid as an internal
standard, was homogenized with 1 mL of 10% (v/v) bar-
ium hydroxide and 0.55 mL of 1,4-dioxane, and the mix-
ture was heated at 100°C for 24 h. After acidification with
6 M hydrochloric acid, fatty acids were extracted with two
aliquots of hexane, which were pooled and taken to dry-
ness under a stream of N2 gas.
Derivatization and GC/MS analysis
All samples were silylated [42,43] by dissolving the dried
extracts in 1 mL of acetonitrile, and adjusted to 6% of bis-
trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide and 10% trimethyl-
chlorosilane. Samples were incubated at 65°C for 20 min,
cooled, and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene fil-
ter. Silylated samples were analyzed by using an Agilent
GC series 6890 equipped with an HP-5ms capillary col-
umn (30 m × 0.32 μm, inner diameter) using helium as
the carrier gas. The GC was coupled to an Agilent 5973
mass detector. The injector was held at 250°C, the oven
was initially at 70°C for 4 min, then ramped at 5°C/min
to 320°C and held at that temperature for 6 min. Result-
ing chromatograms were integrated with Agilent's HP
enhanced ChemStation TM G14701 BA version
D.02.00.275.software. Peaks were identified by compar-
ing acquired mass spectra with the Agilent NIST05 mass
spectrum library.
Synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids
(1) To a solution of diisopropyl amine (3.3 mL, 24 mmol)
in THF (20 mL) at 0°C, n-BuLi was added (8.8 mL, 2.5 M
solution in hexane). The solution was cooled to -78°C
with stirring, and then acetic acid (0.6 g, 10 mmol) in 5
mL of THF was added. After 30 min, decanal (0.56 g, 10
mmol) in 5 mL of THF was added. The mixture was stirred
for 1 h and then brought to RT slowly. The reaction was
diluted with dichloromethane and washed with ammo-
nium chloride solution and the layers then were sepa-
rated. The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate and
then concentrated. The solid mass was crystallized from
dichloromethane to give 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid (mp
141°C). This compound has previously been prepared
from the beta-keto ester [44].

Statistical analysis
All studies were performed at least three independent
times except where noted in the figure legends. Means and
standard errors of the mean are shown. To obtain IC50 and
IC90 values for dose response curve data, the results were
evaluated in the software Table Curve by using a best fit
logistic dose response curve equation. Student's t-test was
used to evaluate the statistical differences between treat-
ments, utilizing the two-tailed distribution and two-sam-
ple equal variance conditions. P-values were accessed by
comparing the level of infectivity with treatment to the
level of cytoxicity seen with that treatment. A significant
difference was determined by a p-value of < 0.05, and sig-
nificance levels were identified in each figure. If the p-
value was > 0.05, the data were not considered signifi-
cantly different.
