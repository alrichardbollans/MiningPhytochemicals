In Coffea arabica leaves, the purine ring of theobromine (3,7- 
dimethylxanthine) and caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) i s  pro- 
vided by de novo purine biosynthesis: (a) [14C]glycine, [14C]bi- 
carbonate, and [14C]formate were incorporated into inosine 5’- 
monophosphate (IMP), sum of adenine nucleotides (ZAde), theo- 
bromine, and caffeine; and (b) incorporation of [14C]formate into 
IMP, ZAde, theobromine, and caffeine was inhibited by azaserine, 
a known inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis. Capacity of 
coffee leaves to salvage added purines was demonstrated by in- 
corporation of [14C]hypoxanthine into ZAde and the incorporation 
of [“Cladenosine, [14C]adenine, [“Clinosine, and [‘4C]hypo- 
xanthine into both theobromine and caffeine. Consistent with 
synthesis of theobromine from two separate purine nucleotide 
pools, one synthesized de novo and one via salvage, added xanthine 
5‘-monophosphate (XMP), inosine, or hypoxanthine failed to re- 
duce the incorporation of [14C]formate into theobromine but di- 
luted the specific radioactivity of [“C]adenosine and [14C]adenine 
incorporated into theobromine. Evidence that theobromine is not 
the immediate precursor of caffeine i s  provided: (a) [14C]xanthine 
was incorporated into caffeine but not into theobromine; (b) ex- 
ogenous xanthine diluted the specific radioactivity of caffeine 
synthesized from [“Cladenine and [14C]hypoxanthine but caused 
accumulation of radiolabel in  theobromine; (c) allopurinol, a 
known inhibitor of the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, 
reduced incorporation of [‘%Iadenine and [14C]hypoxanthine 
into caffeine but caused accumulation of radiolabel in  theobro- 
mine; and (d) incorporation of [14C]formate into caffeine, but 
not into theobromine, was reduced by added XMP, inosine, or 
hypoxanthine.

Attempts to elucidate the pathway by which theobromine 
(3,7-dimethylxanthine) is synthesized in Coffea arabica have 
been limited exclusively to studies of the metabolism of 
preformed nucleosides and bases or their 1-, 3-, or 7-meth- 
ylated counterparts (Looser et al., 1974; Suzuki and Taka- 
hashi, 1975a; Roberts and Waller, 1979; Suzuki and Waller, 
1984). The results of these studies demonstrated that radio- 
labeled adenine, guanine, and xanthine were incorporated 
into 7-methylxanthine, theobromine, and caffeine (Suzuki

and Waller, 1984; Negishi et al., 1985c), whereas the radio- 
labeled ribosides were first incorporated into 7-methylxan- 
thosine and then into 7-methylxanthanine, theobromine, and 
caffeine (Negishi et al., 1992). Both 7-methylxanthosine and 
7-methylxanthine were methylated to form theobromine and 
caffeine, but 7-methylinosine and 7-methylguanosine were 
not (Looser et al., 1974; Baumann and Wanner, 1977). In 
view of these results, there is much speculation regarding the 
substrate of the first methylation step and subsequent enzyme 
reactions leading to the synthesis of theobromine (Ogutuga 
and Northcote, 1970a, 1970b; Baumann and Wanner, 1977; 
Baumann et al., 1978; Roberts and Waller, 1979; Waller et 
al., 1983; Suzuki and Waller, 1984; Suzuki et al., 1992). In 
addition, the relationship between theobromine and caffeine 
(1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) remains equivocal. Paraxanthine 
(1,7-dimethylxanthine) was a better substrate for methylation 
than theobromine or theophylline in the synthesis of caffeine 
in both C. arabica (Roberts and Waller, 1979; Ashihara and 
Nobusawa, 1981) and Camellia sinensis (Suzuki and Taka- 
hashi, 1975a). However, both coffee fruit and tea leaves 
incorporated 1- and 7-[’*CH3]xanthine predominantly into 
theophylline and theobromine, respectively; incorporation 
into paraxanthine was negligible (Suzuki and Takahashi, 
1975a; Roberts and Waller, 1979). 
Additional evidence that theobromine is an immediate 
precursor of caffeine was provided by studies using tea 
leaves: (a) radiolabeled adenine (Ashihara and Kubota, 1986; 
Fujimori and Ashihara, 1990; Fujimori et al., 1991), guanine, 
and hypoxanthine (Suzuki and Takahashi, 1976a, 1976b; 
Ashihara and Kubota, 1987) were incorporated into theo- 
bromine and caffeine to a greater extent than into theophyl- 
line by intact leaves; (b) during leaf development, theobrom- 
ine content decreased as the concentration of caffeine 
increased (Ashihara and Kubota, 1986); and (c) cell-free 
extracts of tea leaves converted 7-methylxanthosine and 7- 
methylxanthine to both theobromine and caffeine (Suzuki 
and Takahashi, 1975a; Negishi et al., 1985a, 1985b; Fujimori 
et al., 1991). 
In the present study, we contrasted the role of purines 
produced endogenously via the de novo pathway in the 
synthesis of theobromine and caffeine with that of purines

generated via the various salvage or catabolic reactions from 
exogenously supplied pools. We also addressed the specific 
question of whether theobromine is the immediate precursor 
of caffeine in coffee leaves. To undertake this study, we 
developed two new methods for isolating and quantifying 
the amount of theobromine and caffeine synthesized from 
radiolabeled precursors by intact cells of leaves of C. arabica. 
Each method, with the proof of its reliability, is reported in 
this communication. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals 
A11 radiolabeled chemicals were purchased from ICN Phar- 
maceuticals, Inc., except [8-'4C]inosine, which was purchased 
from Amersham Corp. Liquiscint (liquid scintillation cocktail) 
was purchased from National Diagnostics. Mineral salts for 
both Shive's and Hoagland nutrient solutions were of ana- 
Iytical reagent quality and were purchased from Fisher Sci- 
entific Co. A11 other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 
Determination of Radioisotope Content 
To determine the content of radioisotope, samples were 
prepared as described in the text and then diluted with 6.5 
mL of liquiscint for each 2 mL of sample. The content of 
radioisotope was measured using a Beckman LS 9000 liquid 
scintillation spectrometer. Each datum was corrected for 
quenching by an automatic extemal standardization system 
of quench analysis. A standard quench curve was detennined 
by using a series of samples containing a known quantity of 
'4C-radioactivity and an increasing amount of chemical 
quencher (CHC13). Data are presented as the means f SE with 
the number of experiments given in parentheses. 
Plant Material 
Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) seedlings were donated by the 
Department of Agriculture in Puerto Rico and imported to 
Califomia in accordance with U.S. Department of Agriculture 
regulations. The seedlings were transplanted in University of 
Califomia soil mix and fertilized twice a week with half- 
strength Hoagland nutrient solution (Hoagland and Amon, 
1950). Young, fully expanded leaves from trees that were 1 
to 5 years old were used in a11 experiments. The leaves were 
coilected just prior to the experiments, washed with distilled 
H20, and quickly blotted dry before weighing. 
lncorporation of Radiolabeled Precursors into Purine 
Nucleotides, Theobromine, and Caffeine 
Leaves of C. arabica (500 mg fresh weight, midrib removed 
and cut in 5- X 5-mm pieces) were routinely preincubated 
for 2 h at 3OoC ir1 5 mL of Shive's nutrient solution (Shive 
and Robbins, 1938) [5 m~ Ca(N03), 2 m~ MgS04, 2 m~ 
KzS04, 1 m~ KH2P04,  1 mg of Fe L-', 0.13 mg of C1 L-', 1 
mg of Mn L-', 0.1 mg of Zn L-', 0.1 mg of B L-', 0.01 mg of 
Cu L-', and 0.01 mg of Na L-'1 adjusted to pH 7.4. At the 
end of the preincubation period, the nutrient solution was 
decanted, and the leaf tissue was immediately transferred to 
fresh Shive's nutrient solution supplemented with one of  the 
following radiolabeled precursors at the final concentration 
and specific radioactivity indicated: 5 m~ ['4C]formate, 3300 
dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ [l-'4C]Gly, 400 dpm nmol-I; 25 m~ ["C]- 
bicarbonate, 2640 dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ [8-14C]inosine, 1100 
dpm nmol-'; 2 m [8-'4C]adenosine, 1100 dpm nmol-I; 2 
m~ [8-'4C]adenine, 1100 dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ [8-'4C]theoph- 
ylline, 150 dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ [l-'4CH3]caffeine, 200 dpm 
nmol-'; [8-14C]hypoxanthine, 200 dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ [8-'4C]- 
xanthine, 400 dpm nmol-'; 2 m~ ~-[ '~cH~]Met,  1540 dpm 
nmol-'; and any other additives in a final volume of !i mL, 
pH 7.4. 
Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 or 7 h at 30'T in 
a water bath shaker. Incubations were camed out in 2,5-mL 
Erlenmeyer flasks, each sealed with a rubber stopper fitted 
with a plastic center well containing a filter paper wick. Just 
before the reactions were terminated, 0.3 mL of 20% (w/v) 
KOH was injected into the center well to absorb any I4CO2 
released during the incubation. The reactions were then 
terminated by injecting 1 mL of 6 N HC1O4 or 15 mL of 95% 
(v/v) ethanol into the main chamber of the flask for the 
subsequent isolation of theobromine or caffeine, respectively. 
The contents of the main chamber of the flask wertt ho- 
mogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (PCU-2, speed 6; 
Brinkman Instruments), and the insoluble material was re- 
moved by centrifugation at 10,OOOg for 10 min at OOC. 
lsolation of Radiolabeled Purine Nucleotide Products by 
Co-Crystallization 
IMP and adenine nucleotides and adenosine synthesized 
by leaf tissue from radiolabeled precursors were converted 
by acid hydrolysis to hypoxanthine and adenine, respectively, 
by heating the acid-soluble fraction at 100°C for 1 h prior to 
neutralization with KOH. Hypoxanthine and adenine were 
isolated from the neutralied acid-soluble fraction by co- 
crystallization with camer (Lovatt, 1983; Tomlinson and Lov- 
att, 1987). 
lsolation of Radiolabeled Theobromine and Caffeine by 
Co-Crystallization 
The supematant fraction from the reactions terminiated 
with HCIOl was neutralized with KOH, and the resulting 
precipitate of KC1O4 was removed by centrifugatiori at 
10,OOOg for 10 min at O°C. The neutralized acid-soluble 
supematant fraction was brought to 125 mL with 0.01 N 13Cl 
and saturated at the boiling point with 1 g of commercial 
theobromine. The supematant fraction from the reactions 
terminated with 85% (v/v) ethanol was made 80% (v/v) 
ethanolic and saturated at the boiling point with 3 g of 
commercial caffeine. The saturated solutions of theobromine 
and caffeine were allowed to cool slowly to room temperature 
and then to 4OC ovemight in a refrigerator. The crystals were 
collected by suction filtration and recrystallized to a constant 
specific radioactivity per 20 mg of crystals dried to a constant 
weight at 6OOC.

theobromine and caffeine synthesized by coffee leaves from 
['4C]formate or radiolabeled purine ribosides and bases was

assessed using two different methods. The purity of theo- 
bromine and caffeine crystals recrystallized to a constant 
specific radioactivity as described above was determined by 
comparing the specific radioactivity of the crystals before and 
after TLC on Eastman Kodak 13254 cellulose with fluorescent 
indicator 6065 using n-propanol:ammonia:H20 (100:60:40, 
v/v/v) as the developing solvent (Ashihara and Nobusawa, 
1981). The commercial standards of theobromine and caf- 
feine were located with a UV light, and, in each case, the 
corresponding area of the chromatogram of the sample was 
cut out and diluted with 4 mL of 0.25 N KOH for determi- 
nation of radioisotope content. 
In addition, potential contamination by radiolabeled purine 
ribosides or bases was assessed by attempting to isolate the 
various ‘‘C-precursors, provided at the concentrations and 
specific radioactivities used in the incorporation studies, from 
a mock neutralized acid-soluble fraction or ethanol-soluble 
fraction without plant tissue by co-crystallization with theo- 
bromine and caffeine, respectively. 
RESULTS 
Demonstration of the de Novo Biosynthesis of the Purine 
Ring of Theobromine and Caffeine in lntact Cells of 
C. arabica 
Evidence that leaves of C. arabica synthesize purine nucle- 
otides and purine alkaloids de novo was provided by dem- 
onstration of the incorporation of the radiolabeled carbons 
of Gly, bicarbonate, and formate into IMP, ZAde, theobrom- 
ine, and caffeine (Table I). 
IMP and ZAde were subjected to acid hydrolysis, and the 
resulting hypoxanthine and adenine, respectively, were 
shown to be radioactive, thus confirming that the radiola- 
beled carbons were incorporated into the purine ring. In 
addition, azaserine, a known inhibitor of de novo purine 
biosynthesis that is effective in plants (Lovatt, 1983; Tomlin- 
son and Lovatt, 1987), inhibited the incorporation of [“CC]- 
formate into BAde by 40% and into IMP, theobromine, and 
caffeine by 30%. 
The reliability of the methods for the isolation of labeled 
theobromine and caffeine by co-crystallization with commer- 
cial canier was verified by two separate techniques. The 
radiolabeled metabolite of [‘4C]formate isolated by CO-crys- 
tallization with camer theobromine or caffeine was shown 
to co-chromatograph with its respective commercial standard. 
In addition, chromatography of either camer containing the 
metabolite of [‘4C]fomate did not result in a significant 
change in its specific radioactivity. The specific radioactivity 
of theobromine and caffeine before chromatography was 620 
and 9 1 O dpm per 20 mg of dry weight of crystals, respectively, 
and 555 and 692 dpm per 20 mg of crystals, respectively, 
after chromatography. Radioactivity above background level 
was not found in any other regions of the chromatograms. 
Recoveries of approximately 80% are typical; no adjustment 
in the data was made to approximate 100% recovery. 
Potential contamination of isolated theobromine and caf- 
feine by radiolabeled purine ribosides and bases was assessed 
by isolating these radiolabeled purine precursors from a mock 
neutralized acid-soluble fraction or ethanol-soluble fraction 
without leaf tissue by co-crystallization with commercial 
carrier. With the exception of a low level of contamination 
(20%) of theobromine by [14C]caffeine, none of the radiola- 
beled precursors used in this study co-crystallized with camer 
theobromine or caffeine (Table 11). 
[I4C]Caffeine was not used as a substrate in any assays, 
and although the specific radioactivity of caffeine synthesized 
by leaf tissue would be significantly lower than that used to 
test for contamination, care was taken in interpreting a11 ex- 
periments assessing incorporation of ‘‘C-precursors into 
theobromine. 
Optimal Conditions for Measuring the lncorporation of 
Radiolabeled Precursors into Theobromine and 
Caffeine in lntad Cells 
Assays routinely used 500 mg fresh weight of leaf tissue 
cut into 5- X 5-mm squares (midrib removed) suspended in 
5 mL of Shive’s nutrient solution, pH 7.4. The optimal 
concentration of [‘4C]Gly incorporated into IMP and into

caffeine was 100 m. This concentration was used to deter- 
mine the effect of the duration of the incubation period on 
caffeine biosyn thesis. Maximum incorporation of [14C]Gly 
into caffeine wiis 345,660 dpm g-' fresh weight of leaf tissue 
obtained with a 7-h incubation period at 3OOC. Preincubation 
of the leaf tissue for 2 or 3 h at 3OoC in Shive's nutrient 
solution doubled the incorporation of [14C]Gly into caffeine 
during the subsequent 7-h incubation period. Thus, a11 studies 
reported here in which incorporation into purine alkaloids 
was assessed used a 2-h preincubation period, followed by 
an incubation period of 7 h in fresh Shive's nutrient solution 
supplemented with a radiolabeled precursor. Under these 
assay conditions, the rate of caffeine biosynthesis obtained 
with 5 m~ ["Clformate was equal to that obtained with 100 
m~ [14C]Gly, and the rate of theobromine biosynthesis was 
doubled over that obtained with the saturating concentration 
of Gly (Table I). Thus, formate was used in a11 assays in 
which the role of the de novo pathway in the synthesis of 
purine alkaloids was examined. Assays measuring the incor- 
poration of radiolabeled precursors into IMP or ZAde used a 
2-h preincubation period followed by a 3-h incubation period 
previously shown to be optimal (Lovatt, 1983). 
The possibility that the incorporation observed reflected 
the activity of fungal or bacterial contamination of the coffee 
leaves is considered unlikely since no growth of microorga- 
nisms was detected after incubation of leaf squares on potato 
dextrose agar in either the dark or light for 60 h at 3OOC. 
Further evidence that the metabolic activities measured were 
those of intact cells of coffee leaves and not those of fungal 
or bacterial contaminants was obtained by comparing the 
release of l4CO, from [8-'4C]hypoxanthine by leaf squares 
with that generated by an equal amount of leaf squares 
homogenized with the Polytron tissue homogenizer at speed 
6. Intact leaf squares degraded 62 nmol of hypoxanthine to 
COz g-' fresh weight of leaf tissue; virtually no I4CO2 was 
generated by the homogenate. 
Evidence that Separate de Novo and Salvage Purine Pools 
Are lnvolved in the Biosynthesis of Theobromine in 
Leaves of C. arabica 
The incorporation of [14C]formate into theobromine was 
significantly reduced by the addition of adenosine or adenine 
to the preincubation and incubation mixtures but not by the 
addition of the ribonucleotide XMP, the riboside inosine, or 
the bases hypoxanthine and xanthine (Table 111). In contrast, 
XMP, inosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine added to the prein- 
cubation and incubation mixtures at a final concentration of 
10 m~ reduced the specific radioactivity of [14C]adenosine 
and [14C]adenine mcorporated into theobromine (Table IV). 
The ability of cofllee leaves to utilize inosine and hypoxan- 
thine for the synthesis of theobromine was confirmed by 
demonstrating that 39 nmol of [I4C]inosine and 50 nmol of 
[14C]hypoxanthine were incorporated into theobromine g-' 
fresh weight of tissue during a 7-h incubation period (Table 
V). There was no significant incorporation of ['4C]xanthine 
into theobromine--approximately 1 nmol was incorporated 
g-' fresh weight of leaf tissue during a 7-h incubation period 
(Table V). In addition, coffee leaves exhibited the capacity to 
convert 236 nmol of [I4C]hypoxanthine into ZAde g-' fresh 
weight during a 3-h incubation period. 
Failure of XMP, inosine, and hypoxanthine to dilute the 
specific radioactivity of [I4C]formate incorporated into theo- 
bromine while diluting the specific radioactivity of [14C]aden- 
osine and [14C]adenine incorporated into theobromine i., s. con- 
sistent with the synthesis of theobromine from two separate 
purine pools: one generated endogenously via the de novo 
biosynthetic pathway and the other by the salvage of sexog- 
enously supplied purines (Fig. 1). The results provide evi- 
dente that exogenously supplied adenosine and adenirle are 
available to both pools, whereas adenine, adenosine, clr ad- 
enine nucleotides synthesized from other exogenously sup- 
plied purines do not enter the de novo pool. 
Evidence that Theobromine and Caffeine Are the 
Products of Separate Pathways in Leaves of C. arabica 
In contrast to the lack of effect by added purines 01'1 the 
incorporation of [14C]formate into theobromine, with the 
exception of adenosine and adenine, incorporation of I"C]- 
formate into caffeine was reduced in the presence of a'dded 
XMP, inosine, adenosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, and xan- 
thine (Table 111). 
In addition, coffee leaves metabolized xanthine in a dffer- 
ent manner in relation to theobromine and caffeine. Incor- 
poration of [I4C]xanthine into theobromine was negli,@ble 
(Table V). Added unlabeled xanthine (10 m final conceiitra- 
tion) increased incorporation of radiolabeled inosine, ade- 
nine, adenosine, and hypoxanthine into theobromine (I'able 
V). Allopurinol, a known inhibitor of degradation of hypo- 
xanthine and xanthine, supplied at final concentration of 10 
m ~ ,  either increased or had no effect on the incorporaticln of 
these precursors into theobromine (Table V). In contrasí!, 90 * 22 (n = 3) nmol of [I4C]xanthine were incorporated into 
caffeine g-' fresh weight of coffee leaves during a 7-h i~icu- 
bation period. Consistent with xanthine being an intermedi-

ate in the synthesis of caffeine, unlabeled xanthine (10 mM 
final concentration) reduced the specific radioactivity of caf- 
feine formed from radiolabeled formate, adenosine, adenine, 
and hypoxanthine (Table VI). Allopurinol (10 m final con- 
centration) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled for- 
mate, adenine, and hypoxanthine into caffeine by more than 
50% (Table VI).

Salvage - Exogenous Pool 
Figure 1. Proposed compartmentalization of two separate pools of 
purines for the biosynthesis of theobromine in leaves of C. arabica, 
one generated endogenously by the de novo pathway and the 
other from salvage of exogenously supplied purines, ribosides, and 
bases. 
The effect of various purines on the incorporation of L- 
[14CH3]Met into theobromine and caffeine was assessed. In- 
corporation into theobromine was 130 and 160% of the 
control value when 3-methyladenine and 7-methylxanthos- 
ine were provided in the reaction mixture. In contrast, the 
incorporation of ~- [ ‘~cH~]Met  into caffeine was significantly 
enhanced by two different monomethylpurines, l-methyl- 
guanosine (141% of control) and 1-methylinosine (130% of 
control). However, when supplied exogenously, a11 three 
dimethylxanthines increased the incorporation of L-[’~CH~]- 
Met into caffeine: paraxanthine (223% of control) > theo- 
bromine (216%) > theophylline (130%). 
Taken together, the results of this research provide strong 
evidence that endogenously synthesized theobromine is not 
the immediate precursor of caffeine in actively metabolizing 
leaves of C. arabica.

significantly greater than reported previously for coffee fruit: 
compare 103 and 171 nmol of [14C]adenine incorporated into 
theobromine and caffeine, respectively, g-’ fresh weight of 
leaf tissue during a 7-h incubation period in this study to 0.3 
and 2.0 nmol of [14C]adenine incorporated into theobromine 
and caffeine, respectively, g-’ of immature coffee fruit during 
a 36-h incubation period (Suzuki and Waller, 1984). The low 
rate of incorporation observed for coffee fruit may be due to 
the duration of the incubation period. For leaves, maximum 
incorporation of radiolabeled precursor into caffeine was 
obtained with a 7-h incubation period. There was a significant 
decrease in the amount of caffeine isolated after 24 h of 
incubation and a 90% reduction after 48 h. 
Although Anderson and Gibbs (1962) and Proiser and 
Serenkov (1963) previously showed that the purine ring of 
caffeine was synthesized de novo in C. arabica and C. sinensis, 
our results provide the first data documenting de novo syn- 
thesis of the purine ring of theobromine. Additional experi- 
ments using the technique of isotope dilution to contrast the 
de novo synthesis, of theobromine with its synthesis from 
exogenously supplied purine ribosides and bases provide 
evidence that the synthesis of theobromine occurs in two 
separate compartments in leaves of C. arabica, one utilizing 
purine rings generated endogenously and de novo, the other 
metabolizing exogenously supplied purines (Fig. 1). Taken 
together, the following results indicate that adenine and 
adenosine, when supplied exogenously, entered the purine 
pools of both cornpartments but did not move between 
compartments when produced endogenously: (a) unlabeled 
adenine and adenosine diluted the specific radioactivity of 
[14C]formate incorporated into theobromine; (b) the specific 
radioactivity of [I4C]adenine or [14C]adenosine incorporated 
into theobromine was diluted by exogenously supplied hy- 
poxanthine, as well as other purine nucleotides and ribosides; 
(c) radiolabeled hypoxanthine was incorporated into ZAde; 
and (d) unlabeled hypoxanthine did not dilute the specific 
radioactivity of [14C]formate incorporated into theobroimine. 
It is tempting to speculate that differences in the specificity 
of one or more membrane camer protein provides the basis 
for the differential uptake between species of exogenously 
supplied purine ribosides and bases into the two com part- 
ments (pools). It is interesting to note that only adimine 
compounds have an amino group at position 6 of the purine 
ring, which could be the structural feature recognized by a 
specific camer protein (Fig. 2). 
The possibility that the de novo and salvage pathways 
occur in separate compartments (pools) between which trans- 
port of intermediates is slow was previously proposed to 
explain the unequal incorporation of precursors of the two 
pathways into adenine and guanine nucleotides (Shuster, 
1963; Robern et al., 1965; Doree, 1973; Clark, 1974; Suzuki 
and Takahashi, 1975b, 1977; Anderson, 1979; reviewed by 
Ross, 1981). The physical location of the enzymes of the de 
novo purine pathway has been little studied (Wagner and 
Backer, 1992), with the exception of nitrogen-fixing nodules 
of the ureide-forming species Vigna unguiculata and Gl.ycine 
max, in which the de novo pathway is clearly segregated in 
the plastids (Boland et al., 1982; Boland and Schubert, 1!)83). 
Whether this is true for nonureide-forming tissues remains 
to be determined. 
Our results are the first to demonstrate the involvement of 
two separate compartments (pools) in the biosynthesis of a 
purine alkaloid. It is not known which of severa1 possible 
enzymes regulates export from the de novo pool and entry 
into the catabolic pool of C. arabica: (a) AMP deaminase, 
which controls adenylate catabolism in spinach leaves and 
Catharanthus roseus cells in suspension culture (Yoshino and 
Murakami, 1980; Yabuki and Ashihara, 1992); (b) IMP oxi- 
doreductase, which regulates the formation of xanthine for 
ureide biosynthesis in nitrogen-fixing nodules of cowpea 
(Shelp and Atkins, 1983); or (c) nucleobase nonspecific 5‘- 
nucleotidases, which generate ribosides for intracelliilar 
transport (Wagner and Backer, 1992). 
Our results clearly indicate that separate compartments 
(pools) are not involved in the biosynthesis of caffeine by

Pathways of Theobromine and Caffeine Synthesis in Coffea arabica 1209 
coffee leaves. Exogenously supplied XMP, inosine, hypoxan- 
thine, and xanthine diluted the incorporation of either ["C]- 
formate or [14C]adenosine and [14C]adenine into caffeine. The 
involvement of two separate pools in the biosynthesis of 
theobromine, but not caffeine, in leaves of C. arabica suggests 
that theobromine is not the immediate precursor of caffeine. 
This possibility is further substantiated by differences in the 
metabolism of xanthine: (a) [14C]xanthine failed to label theo- 
bromine to a significant degree but labeled caffeine signifi- 
cantly; (b) unlabeled xanthine caused radiolabeled inosine, 
adenosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine to accumulate in theo- 
bromine but diluted the specific radioactivity of these com- 
pounds incorporated into caffeine (with the exception of 
inosine, the result of a single experiment, which we cannot 
explain at this time); and (c) allopurinol, a known inhibitor 
of the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, caused radio- 
labeled adenosine and hypoxanthine to accumulate in theo- 
bromine but inhibited the incorporation of adenine and 
hypoxanthine into caffeine. The similarity in the results 
obtained with added xanthine versus allopurinol suggests the 
possibility that xanthine blocks the conversion of hypoxan- 
thme to xanthine, as does allopurinol, resulting in the accu- 
mulation and storage of nitrogen and carbon in theobromine 
rather than in caffeine. Whether the reduced incorporation 
of radiolabeled purines into caffeine in the presence of added 
xanthine is due to isotope dilution or inhibition of hypoxan- 
thine degradation remains to be determined. 
Consistent with theobromine and caffeine being the prod- 
ucts of two separate pathways, each was found to be pref- 
erentially synthesized from different monomethylated purine 
precursors. Although 7-methylxanthosine was only incorpo- 
rated into theobromine in our system, previous researchers 
have provided evidence that 7-methylxanthosine was an 
efficient precursor of both theobromine and caffeine in leaves 
of both coffee (Baumann and Wanner, 1977) and tea (Negishi 
et al., 1985b). Of the dimethylpurines, paraxanthine was the 
best substrate for the synthesis of caffeine, as previously 
reported for both coffee fruits (Roberts and Waller, 1979) and 
leaves (Baumann and Wanner, 1977). 
Reports in the literature defining a pathway for theobrom- 
ine and caffeine biosynthesis are equivoca1 (Wagner and 
Backer, 1992). Our results provide strong evidence that theo- 
bromine is not the immediate precursor of caffeine and 
suggest that theobromine is synthesized from adenine nucle- 
otides without a xanthine species as an intermediate, whereas 
caffeine is likely a product of a methylated xanthine. How- 
ever, our results demonstrate that caffeine is synthesized 
from theobromine, and paraxanthine, when they are supplied 
exogenously. The results of our research underscore that a 
compound might be metabolized differently depending on 
whether it is supplied exogenously or generated endoge- 
nously, and we emphasize the need to understand these 
differences to elucidate the correct biosynthetic pathway. 
Thus, further investigation of the metabolism of endo- 
genously generated purines is warranted to determine the 
exact enzymic events leading to the formation of each purine 
alkaloid.
