acids . Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic methods.
Keywords: Chiococca braquiata, Rubiaceae, flavonoids
Introduction
The genus Chiococca (Rubiaceae) with 22 species is
endemic of the American Continent, and occurs from North
America to Brazil. Several Chiococca species have been
traditionally used in these regions for the treatment of
numerous human ailments including inflammation, anti-
virus, anti-edema and as aphrodisiac.1 Other plants
belonging to the Rubiaceae family have yielded a number
of interesting biologically active compounds,2,3 including
seco-iridoids with mild DNA-activity isolated from
Chiococca alba.4 C. braquiata, however, has not been
subjected to phytochemical analysis or assayed for any
biological activity. In an ongoing quest to identify
biologically active compounds from the Brazilian
Rubiaceae plant species, antifungal evaluation using
Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides
was performed on CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1, v/v) extract from C.
braquiata leaves, which exhibited strong antifungal
activity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the bioactive
extract led to the isolation of the inactive flavonoids 4’-
methoxykaempferol-7-(acetyloxy)-3,5-O-D-L-rhamnoside
(1), apigenin, 7-O-methoxyquercetrin and quercetrin. The
triterpenes D-amirin, E-amirin, ursolic and oleanolic acids
were also isolated. The structure of the new derivative 1
and the known compounds were elucidated by
spectroscopic methods, mainly 2D NMR and MS.
Experimental
General procedures
For column chromatography silica gel 60 (Merck 230-
400 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 were used. TLC analysis
carried out on silica gel 60 F254. IR spectrum was recorded
on a Nicolet Spectrometer. UV spectra were recorded on a
Perkin-Elmer UV/Vis Spectrometer Lambda 14P. The ES-
MS spectra were obtained on a VG Platform II Spectrometer.
NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 on a
469Flavonoids from Chioccoca braquiata (Rubiaceae)Vol. 15, No. 4, 2004
Varian Unit 500 instrument at 500 MHz for 1H and 125
MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT
experiments were performed using polarization transfer
pulses of 90 and 135o.
Plant material
Leaves of Chiococca braquiata Ruiz & Pav. (now
Chiococca alba (L.) Hitchc.) were collected around Lagoa
do Abaeté, BA, Brazil and identified in the Botanical
Institute, SMA, SP. A voucher no. 1934 specimen has been
deposited in the herbarium Maria Eneida P. K. Fidalgo, SP,
Brazil.
Bioassay
The antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides was
performed using direct bioautography with 10 PL of the
solutions of crude extracts and pure compounds, which
were prepared in different concentrations ranging from 300
to 10 Pg  respectively, as described elsewhere.5
Extraction and isolation of compounds
Air-dried powdered leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with
CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) at room temperature. The CH2Cl2-
MeOH extract was evaporated in vacuum to give a crude
extract (120 g), which was partitioned into equal volumes
of MeO-H2O (80%) and hexane (3x). The hydromethanolic
extract was concentrated to 60% and was subsequently
extracted using CHCl3 (3x) and EtOAc (3x). These were
evaporated to give a hexane phase (5 g), a chloroform
phase (12 g), an ethyl acetate phase (4.7 g) and a
hydromethanolic phase (42 g).
The ethyl acetate phase was applied to a column of
Sephadex LH-20 (30 g) eluted with MeOH-H2O with
increasing polarity to give 17 fractions. Fraction 8 (123 mg)
was applied again to a column of Sephadex LH-20 (5 g)
eluted with MeOH to give 6 fractions. The sub-fractions
8.2 and 8.3 yielded mixture of triterpenes D-amirin and E-
amirin (39 mg) and ursolic and oleanolic acids (64 mg),
respectively. Fractions 11 and 12 were combined (176 mg)
and further purified by reverse phase preparative thin-layer
chromatography in MeOH-H2O (8.5:1.5) leading to the
isolation of 4’-methoxykaempferol-7-(acetyloxy)-3,5-O-
D-L-rhamnoside (1; 21 mg). Fraction 13 (460 mg) was
applied to a silica gel column (230-400 mesh) eluted with
ethyl acetate containing increasing concentration of
methanol (up to 100%) to give apigenin (2; 174 mg).
Fraction 14/15 (111 mg) was applied to a column of
Sephadex LH-20 (2 g) eluted with MeOH to give 7-O-
methoxyquercetrin (3; 60 mg). Fractions 16/17 (175 mg),
after recristalization in acetone, gave quercetrin (4;
165 mg).

Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous
powder, with molecular formula C30H34O15 deduced from
the [M+Na]+ peak at m/z 657 in the ES-MS and supported
by 13C and 1H NMR data. Its UV spectrum exhibited
characteristic absorbance bands of flavonols10 at 259 and
341 nm. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) revealed
two set signals, which features indicated a flavonoid with
glycosidic and acetyl groups. The 1H NMR signals
attributed to the aglycone at d 7.75 (2H, d, J 8.0 Hz), 6.89
(2H, d, J 8.0 Hz), identified as a 2H AA’ and a 2H XX’system,
6.63 (1H, d, J 1.25 Hz), 6.32 (1H, d, J 1.25 Hz) showed
characteristic pattern of kaempferol.5 The 1H NMR spectra
also showed signals at G 5.30 (2H, br s), 3.92 (2H, br, dd, J
9.0, 11.0 Hz), 3.48 (2H, dd, J 9.0, 10.8 Hz), 3.28 (2H, m),
3.08 (2H, m) and 0.87 (6H, d, J 6.5 Hz), which revealed the
presence of at least two glycosyl moieties, clearly
evidenced by integration area of the peaks corresponding
to these signal values. In addition, a methoxyl and an
acetyl groups were also confirmed by two singlets at G
3.79 (56.0 q) and G 1.87 (24.3 q) and 174.7 (s), respectively.
The identification of the sugar moieties as two
D-rhamnopyranosides was determined from the chemical
shifts, multiplicity of the signals, and absolute values of
the coupling constants in the 1H NMR and 1H-1H COSY
spectra as well as 13C NMR data. The signals observed in
the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) at G 101.8 (d), 74.4 (d),
72.6 (d), 72.5 (d), 71.1 (d), 18.5 and 17.5 (q) clearly
indicated that the sugar moiety was rhamnose. In addition,
the evidence of two distinct signals for characteristic
methyl groups of rhamnose deeply aided the proposal of
two rhamnose moieties in compound 1. The ES-MS ions
peaks at m/z 365 [M-(2x rham) + Na]+, m/z 363 [M-(294) +
Na]+ and m/z 186 [C6H11O4 + Na]+ also emphasized the
presence of two rhamnopyranoside units in compound 1.
The first indication of the positions C-3 and C-5 as
substitution sites in 1 was evidenced from the 1H NMR
spectrum, which do not showed the typical signals
assigned to H-3 and the HO-C-5 quelate. The HMBC
spectrum (Table 1) confirmed these positions as glycosy-
lation sites due to the connectivities that were observed
between G 5.30 (1H, br s, H-1”) and 134.2 (C-3) and the
correlation between G 5.30 (1H, br s, H-1”’) and 161.7
(C-5). The correlation between the signal corresponding
to -OCH3 at G 3.79 with C-4’ at d 161.7 also was important
to attribute all substitutions in 1, if we consider that the
only remain place linkage for the acetyl group should be
at hydroxyl group in C-7. In fact, by the NOESY
experiments (Figure 1) was observed a weak spatial
correlation between the signal at G 6.89 (H-3’ and/or H-5’
with the resonance at G 3.79 corresponding to -OMe. The
absence of cross peaks correlation between H-6 and H-8
with the CO of the acetyl group could suggested that this
group was not attached to the hydroxyl at C-7. However, a
correlation observed in the HMBC spectrum (Table 1)
between the anomeric hydrogens at G 5.30 and C-5 (161.7)
and C-3 (134.2) indicated that the second sugar unit was
located at C-3, and thus corroborated the acetylation site
at C-7. These findings confirmed the substitution pattern
for compound 1. The absence of a bathochromic shift in
the UV (methanol) spectrum after the addition of AlCl3
was other important evidence for the substitution of the 5-
OH, as well as the substitution at C-7 being indicated by
the absence of a bathochromic shift in band II (ring A)
upon addition of NaOAc. To our knowledge, 1 is a new
flavonol derivative assigned as 4’-methoxykaempferol-7-
(acetyloxy)-3,5-O-D-L-rhamnoside (1).
The strong antifungal activity detected in the crude
extract (minimum amount required for the inhibition of
fungal growth on TLC plates = 10 Pg for C.
cladosporioides, standard nystatin = 1.0 Pg) was decreased
proportionally during fractionation procedures. The
detection limit values of the CHCl3, and EtOAc bioactive
solubles (50 and 30 Pg, respectively) suggested that the
antifungal activity was substantially lost during guided-
fractionating of the EtOAc extract with fungus C.
cladosporioides. The very weak activity detected for pure
flavonols 1-4 (detection limit values higher than 300 Pg)
indicated that their individual activities are not potent
enough to be considered for practical use or to justify the
strong activity detected in the crude extract. The antifungal
activity against C. cladosporioides was significantly
enhanced when a combination of the flavonols 1, 2, 3 and
4 where tested. The detection limit of compound 1 against
C. cladosporioides was reduced from 350 to 100 Pg when
it was combined with compounds 2 (300), 3 (400), and 4
(250). Based on these observations, the synergistic activity
of these compounds, and probably of others not isolated
in this study, against this fungus, could be inferred.
