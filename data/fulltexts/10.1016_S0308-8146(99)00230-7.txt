Anthocyanin trisaccharides in blue berries of Vaccinium padifoliumLuis Cabrita, Nils A˚ge Frøystein, Øyvind M. Andersen*Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Alle´gt. 41, 5007 Bergen, NorwayReceived 19 April 1999; received in revised form 16 September 1999; accepted 16 September 1999AbstractDelphinidin 3-O-a-rhamnoside, malvidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside) and the 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyr-anosyl-200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranosides) of cyanidin, petunidin and peonidin were isolated by various chromatographictechniques from the edible berries of Vaccinium padifolium. Their complete structures were elucidated mainly by one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Together they account for 7% of the anthocyanin content in this species. Noanthocyanidin 3-triglycoside, 3-rutinoside or 3-rhamnoside had previously been found in the genus Vaccinium. The 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl-200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranosides) of petunidin and peonidin are novel compounds. # 2000 ElsevierScience Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionVaccinium padifolium is a deciduous shrub endemic toMadeira island (Portugal). Its berries have been used asfood preserves and in local ethnopharmacology (cough,colds, bronchitis, dysentery) (Rivera & Obo´n, 1995), andexported for commercial production of ophthalmic speci-alities (Vieira, 1992). We have recently reported twentydierent anthocyanins, including the 3-O-b-glucopyrano-sides, 3-O-b-galactopyranosides, 3-O-b-arabinopyrano-sides and 3-O-sambubiosides (200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-O-b-glucopyranosides) of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin,peonidin and malvidin to occur in its berries (Cabrita &Andersen, in press).The aim of this study is to present the isolation andstructure elucidation of five additional anthocyanins in V.padifolium, which have not been reported in this genusbefore, including two novel anthocyanidin 3-triglycosides.2. Materials and methods2.1. Extraction and separationRipened berries of Uveira, (Vaccinium padifolium)(Ericaceae) were collected in Madeira island (Portugal)in October 1995 and stored atÿ20C. The berries (100 g)were extracted ten times with 100 ml MeOH containing1% TFA at 4C. The combined extract was filtered,concentrated under reduced pressure and partitionedagainst ethyl acetate. The purified extract was thenadsorbed on a column packed with Amberlite XAD-7,washed with water, eluted with MeOH containing 0.1%TFA and dried. The sample was fractionated on aSephadex LH-20 column (100050 mm) using step elu-tion with 20–60% MeOH–H2O (containing 0.1% TFA)and the collected fractions were further purified bysemi-preparative HPLC.2.2. HPLC and TLCAnalytical and semi-preparative high performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC) separations were per-formed on a HP-1050 module system (Hewlett–Pack-ard) using an ODS Hypersil column (2004.6 mm, 5mm) and diode array detection. Two solvents were usedfor elution: A. HCO2H:H2O (1:9, v/v); B. MeOH:H-CO2H:H2O (5:1:4, v/v). Analytical HPLC: the elutionprofile was 0–4 min, 10% B in A (isocratic); 4–21 min,10–100% B in A (linear gradient), 21–25 min, 100% B(isocratic). The flow rate was 1.2 ml minÿl. Semi-pre-parative HPLC: 0–4 min, 10% B in A (isocratic); 4–30min, 10–100% B, 30–35 min, 100% B. Prior to injectionall samples were filtered through a 0.45 mm Milliporemembrane filter. Peak percentages were estimated fromseveral HPLC chromatograms obtained using gradients0308-8146/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

HCl:H2O (1:1:2).2.3. SpectroscopyUV-vis absorption spectra (240–600 nm, 2 nm steps)were recorded in 0.01% conc. HCl in MeOH. On-lineabsorbance signals were recorded for every second nmbetween 500 and 540 nm.The NMR experiments (DQF-COSY, 1D TOCSY,1H-13C HSQC, 1H-13C HMBC, 13C SEFT) wereobtained at 600.13 and 150.92 MHz for 1H and 13C,respectively, on a Bruker DRX-600 instrument at 25C.The deuteriomethyl 13C signal and the residual 1H signalof the solvent (CF3CO2D:CD3OD; 1:19, v/v) were usedas secondary references (49.0 and 3.4 ppm from TMS,respectively).3. Results and discussionThe berries were extracted with an acidified metha-nolic solution. The extract was purified by liquid–liquidpartition and washed on XAD-7. The eluate was con-centrated under vacuum to dryness (1.2 g), and separa-tion of the sample (1.0 g) on Sephadex LH-20 yielded 44fractions that were analysed by TLC and analyticalHPLC. After further purification by semi-preparativereversed-phase HPLC, fractions 4–7 yielded pigments 1(1.1 mg), 2 (3.3 mg) and 4 (2.5 mg); fractions 6–9 aordedTable 1UV-visible data and retention times (HPLC) for the 3-(600-rhamnosyl-200-xylosylglucosides) of cyanidin (1), petunidin (2) and peonidin (4),delphinidin 3-rhamnoside (3) and malvidin 3-rutinoside (5)Anthocyanin Vis max (nm) A440/Amax (%) HPLC, tR (min)1 531 27 18.22 540 30 19.33 540 20 20.14 531 31 24.85 540 22 26.8Table 21H NMR chemical shifts and 1H-1H coupling constants for the 3-(600-rhamnosyl-200-xylosylglucosides) of cyanidin (1), peonidin (4) and petunidin (2),malvidin 3-rutinoside (5) and delphinidin 3-rhamnoside (3)1 4 2 5 3d (ppm) J (Hz) d (ppm) J (Hz) d (ppm) J (Hz) d (ppm) J (Hz) d (ppm) J (Hz)Aglycone4 8.97 s 9.04 s 8.99 s 9.10 s 9.04 s6 6.76 d 1.8 6.77 d 1.8 6.76 d 1.8 6.82 d 1.8 6.74 d 2.08 6.98 dd 2.0, 0.7 7.03 d 0.9 7.00 d 1.1 78.09 d 1.5 6.94 dd 1.8, 0.620 8.13 d 2.2 8.14 d 2.2 7.86 d 2.2 8.13 s 7.65 s50 7.1 d 8.8 7.14 d 8.860 8.37 dd 8.8, 2.2 8.49 dd 8.7,2.2 7.99 d 2.2 8.13 s 7.65 sOMe 4.12 s 4.12 s 4.10 s3-O-glucoside100 5.53 d 7.7 5.53 d 7.7 5.54 d 7.7 5.41 d 7.7200 4.06 dd 7.7, 9.2 4.02 dd 7.7,91.2 4.03 dd 7.7, 9.2 3.73 dd 7.7,9.2300 9.86 t 9.2 3.86 t 9.2 3.85 t 9.2 3.63 t 9.2400 3.56 t 9.2 3.54 t 9.2 3.55 t 9.4 3.48 t 9.2500 3.82 ddd 9.2, 5.5, 1.8 3.82 ddd 8.8, 6.6, 1.8 3.82 ddd 9.2, 6.6, 1.8 3.81 ddd 9.5, 6.6, 1.8600 A 4.13 dd 11.4, 1.8 4.13 dd 11.4, 1.8 4.12 dd 11.4, 1.8 4.14 dd 11.4, 1.8600 B 3.70 dd 11.4, 5.5 3.69 dd 11.4, 6.6 3.70 dd 11.4, 6.6 3.68 dd 11.4, 6.6200-O-xylosyl10 0 0 4.85 d 7.7 4.85 d 7.7 4.77 d 7.720 0 0 3.25 dd 7.7, 9.2 3.23 dd 7.7, 9.0 3.23 dd 7.7, 9.230 0 0 3.40 t 9.2 3.39 t 9.2 3.36 t 9.240 0 0 3.49 ddd 10.3, 9.2, 5.5 3.48 ddd 10.2, 9.2, 5.5 3.42 ddd 10.3, 9.2, 5.550 0 0 A 3.78 dd 11.4, 5.5 3.77 dd 11.4, 5.5 3.67 dd 12.1, 5.550 0 0 B 3.14 dd 11.4, 10.3 3.14 dd 11.4, 10.3 3.05 dd 12.1, 10.3600-O-rhamnosyl 3-O-rhamnoside10v 4.73 d 1.5 4.73 d 1.5 4.73 d 1.5 4.73 d 1.5 5.82 d 1.520v 3.86 dd 1.5, 3.3 3.85 dd 1.5, 3.3 3.85 dd 1.5, 3.3 3.87 dd 1.5, 3.3 4.35 dd 1.5, 3.330v 3.71 dd 3.3, 9.5 6.39 dd 3.3, 9.2 3.69 dd 3.3, 9.5 3.69 dd 3.3, 9.2 4.02 dd 3.3, 9.340v 3.41 t 9.3 3.40 t 9.5 3.40 t 9.4 3.40 t 9.3 3.66 t 9.450v 3.65 dd 9.2, 6.2 3.69 dd 9.5, 6.2 3.64 dd 9.2, 6.2 3.31 dd 9.5, 6.2 3.73 dd 9.5, 6.260v 1.23 d 6.2 1.23 d 6.2 1.22 d 6.2 1.23 d 6.2 1.37 d 6.234 L. Cabrita et al. / Food Chemistry 69 (2000) 33–36pigment 5 (4.9 mg), and pigment 3 (7.5 mg) was recov-ered from fractions 35–37 (Table 1).The low-field part of the 1H NMR spectrum of 4showed 6 resonances (see Table 2). On the basis of che-mical shifts and coupling-patterns, the signals of theAMX system at 8.14, 7.14 and 8.49 ppm were assignedto H-20, H-50 and H-60, respectively, the 2H AX systemat 7.03 and 6.77 ppm to H-8 and H-6, and the singlet at9.04 ppm to H-4. Together with the 3H singlet at 4.12ppm (OMe), which in the HMBC spectrum correlatedwith C-30 (4.1/149.8 ppm) (Fig. 1), these assignmentsconfirmed the identity of the aglycone to be peonidin.The anomeric proton signals in the 1H NMR spec-trum of 4 appear considerably downfield for the othersugar resonances, and thus the three doublets at 5.53,4.86 and 4.73 ppm, together with the integration data,defined a 1:1:1:1 ratio between the peonidin aglyconeand the three sugars. Starting from the doublet at 4.73ppm (H-1IV) the observed crosspeak with the signal at3.85 ppm in the DQF-COSY permitted assignment ofH-2. The chain of coupled protons H-2, H-3, H-4, H-5and H-6, was, thereafter, assigned using the same spec-trum (Table 2). Subsequently the chemical shifts of thecorresponding carbon atoms (Table 3) were assignedfrom the HSQC experiment, which together with 1H-1Hcoupling constants were in agreement with an a-linkedrhamnopyranosyl. On the basis of a combination ofCOSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC and SEFT NMRspectra it was possible to assign all the 1H (Table 2) and13C (Table 3) resonances of the other sugar moieties,which were determined to be b-glucopyranosyl and b-xylopyranosyl units. The HMBC spectrum of 4 revealedcross-peaks establishing that the glucosyl was attachedto the aglycone 3-position H-100/C-3, 5.6/145.4 ppm),while the xylosyl and rhamnosyl residues were attachedto the 200- (H-1000/C-200, 4.9/81.4 ppm) and the 600-posi-tions (H-1IV/C-600, 4.8/67.7 ppm) of the glucosyl moiety,respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, the identity of 4 was foundto be peonidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl-200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside).The 1H and 13C shifts of 2 (Tables 2 and 3) wereassigned by the same one- and two-dimensional homo-and heteronuclear NMR techniques as used for 4,showing the same sugar moiety. The aglycone B-ringsignals of 2 at 7.86 and 7.99 ppm were assigned to H-20and H-60, respectively, and the cross-peak between theFig. 1. The arrows refer to proton and carbon cross-peaks in theHMBC NMR spectrum of peonidin 3-O-(600-a-rhamnosyl-200-b-xylo-syl-b-glucoside) showing linkage points between the dierent moieties.Table 313CNMR chemical shifts for the 3-(600-rhamnosyl-200-xylosylgluco-sides) of cyanidin (1), peonidin (4) and petunidin (2), malvidin 3-ruti-noside (5) and delphinidin 3-rhamnoside (3)1 4 2 5 3d (ppm) d (ppm) d (ppm) d (ppm) d (ppm)Aglycone2 163.64 164.29 164.38 163.98 164.493 145.31 145.32 145.34 145.74 144.514 136.43 136.39 136.51 136.68 135.515 159.01 159.08 159.36 159.16 159.116 103.50 103.58 103.43 102.39 103.387 170.38 170.64 169.52 170.76 170.348 94.63 94.60 94.80 nd 95.089 157.97 157.80 157.77 157.91 157.7110 113.78 113.39 113.09 113.59 113.3610 121.26 121.10 122.30 119.87 120.0020 118.60 115.19 108.83 110.83 112.1130 147.53 149.76 149.58 149.85 147.7340 154.93 156.77 147.43 146.39 144.8950 117.44 116.05 144.48 149.85 147.7360 128.33 130.04 115.05 110.83 112.11OMe 56.87 57.29 57.343-O-glucoside100 101.33 101.82 101.77 103.77200 81.66 81.37 82.54 74.98300 78.11 78.15 77.94 77.61400 70.98 70.98 70.87 71.37500 77.37 77.45 77.53 78.18600 67.62 67.71 67.73 67.85200-O-xylosyl100 0 105.75 105.43 105.20200 0 75.75 75.60 75.68300 0 71.63 71.63 71.74400 0 70.99 70.99 70.92500 0 67.23 67.14 67.01600-O-rhamnosyl 3-O-rhamnoside10v 102.17 102.21 102.30 102.26 102.6420vv 71.90 70.89 71.93 71.91 71.5530v 72.45 72.44 72.52 72.48 72.3140v 73.94 73.98 73.93 73.90 73.3150v 69.80 69.82 69.83 69.80 72.1660v 17.87 17.88 17.89 17.88 17.95nd Not detected.L.

The HMBC spectrum further revealed theconnectivities between the aglycone and the 3-glucosyl(H-100/C-3, 5.6/145.3 ppm), between the 3-glucosyl andthe 200-xylosyl (H200/C1000, 4.0/105.2 ppm) and the 600-rhamnosyl (H600A/C1IV, 4.0/102.3 ppm). Thus, 2 wasfound to be petunidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl-200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside).Based on similar 1H and 13C NMR assignments asused for 2 and 4 (Tables 2 and 3), the identities of 1, 3and 5 were found to be cyanidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamno-pyranosyl- 200–b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside), del-phinidin 3-rhamnopyranoside and malvidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside), respectively.4. ConclusionPigments 2 and 4, the 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnpyranosyl-200-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranosides) of petunidin andpeonidin, respectively, are novel compounds. Otheranthocyanidin 3-O-(600-rhamnosyl-200-xylosylglucosides)seem to be relatively rare in nature. The correspondingderivative of delphinidin has been found in flowers ofLinum grandiflorum cv Scarlet Flax (Toki, Saito, Har-ada, Shigihara & Honda, 1995), while the cyanidin deri-vative has a more widespread distribution, including thegenera Ribes and Rubus (Mazza & Miniati, 1993). Alsomalvidin 3-O-(600-O-a-rhamnpyranosyl-b-glucopyrano-sides), 3, and delphinidin 3-rhamnopyranoside, 5, seem tohave a rather limited occurrence in plants (Harborne &Grayer, 1988; Strack & Wray, 1994).The anthocyanidin 3-triglycosides constitute less than2% of the total anthocyanin content, while the antho-cyanidin 3-diglycosides account for 14%, where 1% ismalvidin 3-rutinoside and the rest are the 3-sambubio-sides (Cabrita & Andersen, in press). The monoglyco-sides altogether contribute with 86%, where 3.9% isdelphinidin 3-rhamnoside. The pigments described in thispaper account for approximately 7% of the anthocyanincontent in Vaccinium padifolium.From a chemotaxonomic point of view it is interestingto note the presence of anthocyanidin 3-triglycosides and3-disaccharides together with delphinidin 3-rhamnoside inV. padifolium, since none of these anthocyanin classes hasbeen identified in any other Vaccinium species before. Theberries of these latter species seem to be characterized onlyby anthocyanidin 3-monoglucosides, 3-monogalactosidesand 3-monoarabinosides (Mazza & Miniati, 1993). How-ever, most Vaccinium species contain a complex antho-cyanin mixture, which is dicult to separate in a scalenecessary for proper pigment elucidation, at least for pig-ments occurring in relatively low amounts.AcknowledgementsLC is grateful to Mr Victor Freitas (Univ.
