Um método simples, isocrático, de HPLC foi desenvolvido para quantificação simultânea de 
dois triterpenos bioativos, ácido ursólico e lactona do ácido ursólico em folhas de E. tereticornis. As 
amostras foram analisadas em coluna RP-18 (4,6 × 250 mm, 5 µm) com metanol e água acidificada 
a pH 3,5 com TFA (88:12) a 210 nm. O método foi validado e aplicado para a quantificação 
simultânea dos triterpenos individuais em extrato de E. tereticornis. As curvas de calibração foram 
lineares no intervalo de concentração de 0,05 a 0,3 mg mL-1 (r = 0,999 e 0,998, respectivamente). Os 
limites de detecção e quantificação foram 0,190 e 0,644 µg para ácido ursólico e 0,176 e 0,587 µg 
para lactona do ácido ursólico, enquanto as porcentagens de recuperação foram 97,32 e 96,23% 
para ácido ursólico e lactona do ácido ursólico, respectivamente. Este é o primeiro relato sobre o 
método HPLC de lactona do ácido ursólico com alta precisão e exatidão.
A simple isocratic HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of 
two bioactive triterpenes, ursolic acid and ursolic acid lactone in E. tereticornis leaves. Samples 
were analyzed on RP-18 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm) column with methanol and water acidified to 
pH 3.5 with TFA (88:12) at 210 nm. The method was validated and applied for the simultaneous 
quantification of the individual triterpenes in E. tereticornis extract. The calibration curves were 
linear over a concentration range of 0.05-0.3 mg mL-1 (r = 0.999 and 0.998, respectively). The limits 
of detection and quantification were 0.190 and 0.644 µg for ursolic acid, and 0.176 and 0.587 µg 
for ursolic acid lactone, while the percentage recoveries were 97.32 and 96.23% for ursolic acid 
and ursolic acid lactone, respectively. This is the first report on the HPLC method of ursolic acid 
lactone with high precision and accuracy.

Introduction 
Eucalyptus tereticornis Smith (Myrtaceae, Mysore 
Gum) extensively grown in various states of India.1 It is 
a valuable quick growing species grown on large scale 
for afforestation programmes throughout India for its use 
as a raw material for pulp wood industry. Eucalyptus is 
a popular medicine for abscess, arthritis, asthma, boils, 
bronchitis, burns, cancer, catarrh, cold, cough, croup, 
cystitia, diabetes, diptheria, dysentery, dyspepsia, fever, flu, 
grippe, inflammation, laryngitis, leprosy, malaria, miasma, 
phthisis, rhinitis, sores, sore throat, spasms, tuberculosis, 
tumors, vaginitis, wounds, and worms.2-5 
The leaves are a good source of essential oil,6 and in 
Ayurveda its oil is used as an antiseptic and for respiratory 
tract infections. Apart from the essential oil, a number 
of phytochemicals have been isolated from the various 
parts of E. tereticornis such as, flavanoids,7 euglobal T1,8 
triterpenoids as betulonic acid, tereticornate A, tereticornate 
B,7 betulinic acid,9 2α-hydroxy ursolic acid, ursolic acid, 
ursolic acid lactone10 and β-sitosterol.9 After essential oil 
isolation, the leaves of E. tereticornis can be further utilized 
for large scale isolation of anticancer agent, ursolic acid 
(UA, 1) and ursolic acid lactone (UAL, 2)11 (Figure 1).
Ursolic acid has shown many important pharmacological 
activities, analgesic, anti-tumor,12 anti-bacterial,13 diuretic, 
anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, COX-2 inhibitor, anti- 
inflammatory,14 hepatoprotective,15 anti-HIV16 and 
anti-cancer against various human cancer cell lines.17,18 
Because of its anticancer activities, ursolic acid has 
been the subject of interest for preclinical anti-cancer 
research. On the other hand ursolic acid lactone has also 
shown antiproliferative activity against human gastric 
adenocarcinoma (MK1), uterine carcinoma (HeLa) and 
murine melanoma (B16F10)19 along with substantial anti-
inflammatory activity.20 
Maurya and Srivastava 469Vol. 23, No. 3, 2012
Although there are several HPLC analytical methods 
for ursolic acid from different plants,21-23 there is no 
HPLC method for the analysis of bioactive ursolic acid 
lactone as well as for UA (1) and UAL (2) in the leaves 
of E. tereticornis. Hence the objective of present work 
is to develop simple, rapid, precise and accurate method 
for determination of bioactive UA (1) and UAL (2) in the 
leaves of E. tereticornis for better evaluation and medicinal 
utilization of leaves in the future. 
Experimental 
Plant material
The leaves of E. tereticornis were collected from the 
medicinal farm of Central Institute of Medicinal and 
Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India 
during the month of January, 2008. Voucher specimen 
(CIMAP N.12470) is deposited in the Botany and 
Pharmacognosy Department of the institute.
Isolation and characterization of reference compounds 
The reference marker compounds, ursolic acid (1) and 
ursolic acid lactone (2) were isolated in ≥ 95% purity by 
fast centrifugal partition chromatography (FCPC)11 and 
characterized on the basis of their spectroscopic data (see 
Supplementary Information).7,24 
Sample preparation
The dried leaves of E. tereticornis (100 mg) were 
extracted three times with ethyl acetate (5 mL) in an 
ultrasonic extractor (Micro clean -109 bath; Oscar India). 
All the extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness 
at 35 oC. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL methanol and 
filtered in 0.45 µm membrane filtered through (Millipore).
Chemicals and standards 
All the reagents and solvents used were of HPLC grade 
(E. Merck Ltd., Mumbai, India), while the reference marker 
compounds, ursolic acid (1) and ursolic acid lactone (2) 
were isolated in ≥ 95% purity as discussed above. 
Apparatus and chromatographic conditions
A sonicator (Microclean 109, Oscar Ultrasonic, 
Mumbai, India) was used for sample preparation, The 300 
MHz NMR (Avance, Bruker, Switzerland) was used to 
record 1H and 13C NMR.
A HPLC pump (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), LC-10A 
equipped with Shimadzu SPD-M10 Avp (PDA set at 
210 nm) detector and Rheodyne injection valve with a 
20 µL loop was used. Ursolic acid (1) and ursolic acid 
lactone (2) were analyzed on a Water symmetry shield RP-
18 column (4.6 × 250 mm i.d., 5 µm, Waters). The mobile 
phase used was a mixture of methanol-water acidified to 
pH-3.5 with TFA (88:12 v/v) with 1 mL min-1 flow rate. 
The HPLC system was operated at room temperature 
25 ± 1 ºC.
Preparation of standard solution
The stock solution of 1 mg mL-1 was prepared in 
methanol for standard markers UA (1) and UAL (2). A serial 
dilution was made for each stock solutions at concentrations 
of 50, 100, 200 300 µg mL-1, by adding methanol and 20 µL 
of each was used for plotting the standard curve for UA (1) 
and UAL (2), respectively.

Determination of Ursolic Acid and Ursolic Acid Lactone in the Leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis by HPLC J. Braz. Chem. Soc.470
Validation of HPLC method
Linearity (calibration curve) 
The linearity of the method for each standard was 
established by injection of 20 µL of standard solution 
of different concentration. The linearity of UA (1) and 
UAL (2) were analyzed in triplicate. The calibration curves 
were constructed by plotting peak areas against analyte 
concentration. The linearity was assessed by calculating 
the slope, y-intercept and coefficient of determination (r2) 
using least squares regression equation.
Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ)
The linear regression equation of calibration curve 
was used to determine the LOD and LOQ. Under the 
chromatographic conditions employed in the current study, 
LOD (S/N = 3) and LOQ (S/N = 10) were determined for 
UA (1) and UAL (2). 
Precision and accuracy
The repeatability (intra-day precision), the intermediate 
precision (inter-day precision) and the accuracy of the 
method were determined at three different concentrations. 
Samples were prepared by spiking stock standard solutions 
with ethyl acetate extract of E. tereticornis leaves. The 
intra-day and inter-day precision of the method for UA (1) 
and UAL (2) were measured by peak area determination 
of triterpenoids in triplicate.
The precision is expressed as % RSD and the accuracy 
is expressed as the percentage recovery of the added 
triterpenoids.
Recovery
To determine the recovery percentage, a measured 
amount of 0.8 mg each of UA (1) and UAL (2) were added 
to the ethyl acetate extract of E. tereticornis leaves and was 
analyzed according to the following formula,
Recovery (%) = (A – B)/C × 100% 
where A is the amount detected, B is the amount of 
sample without standards and C is the spiked amount of 
the standards. 
All the statistical analysis was performed on the 
GraphPad Prism-5 (Graph Pad software, Inc., USA, 2008).
Results and Discussion 
 Triterpenoids show poor UV absorption due to lack 
of chromophore moieties in their chemical structures. 
This is the major limitation in the analysis of this class 
of compounds using UV detection. However, there are 
some reports on triterpenoids and saponins detection at 
low wavelength range25,26 in other plants. In some cases 
derivatization26 has also been used for the detection at 
higher wavelengths, but this additional step may results 
in significant error in the method. As discussed earlier, 
although there are several HPLC analytical methods for 
ursolic acid from different plants,21-23 there is no HPLC 
method for the analysis of bioactive ursolic acid lactone, 
hence this work was designed to develop a simple, rapid, 
precise and accurate method for UA (1) and UAL (2) 
determination in the leaves of E. tereticornis. 
It was observed that the mobile phases used in 
earlier HPLC methods for ursolic and oleanolic acid 
determination were composed of three solvents,21 
acetic acid,21 H3PO4, and buffers.23 It has been common 
observation that frequent use of buffer in mobile phase 
reduces the life of column, HPLC pump, detector flow 
cell and creates high pressure. Therefore, use of TFA in 
HPLC methods to control pH and no ion pairing in acid 
is preferred in comparison to buffers.27 
Different types of column and mobile phase compositions 
were carefully tested in order to determine the optimal 
chromatographic conditions. It was found that better 
separation and shapes peak were achieved with Waters 
Symmetry Shield RP-18 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm) column 
at column temperature 25 ± 1 ºC. For the mobile phase, 
separation using only methanol or water was unsatisfactory, 
but methanol as an organic modifier with an aqueous-TFA 
solution (pH-3.5) performed well. In this case addition of 
TFA improved separation and peak shapes by controlling 
pH without any ion pairing for acidic analytes.
An isocratic system added simplicity, precision, 
accuracy, and minimized the variation at baseline. The 
above series of investigation led us to arrive at an optimal 
mobile phase for the simultaneous determination of UA 
(1) and UAL (2) in E. tereticornis leaf extract, namely 
methanol-water acidified to pH-3.5 with TFA (88:12 v/v) 
with a flow rate 1 mL min-1. Figure 2 (a, b and c) shows 
the HPLC chromatogram detected at 210 nm.
For validation of analytical methods, the guidelines 
of International Conference on the Harmonization 
[ICH-Q2 (R1)28] recommend accomplishment of accuracy 
tests, precision and linearity of the method. The type of 
method and its respective use determine the parameter to 
be evaluated, especially, when the samples are complex 
biological matrices, as the case of herbal extracts UA (1) 
and UAL (2) presented retention time of 9.7 and 16.4 min. 
The calibration curves for UA and UAL were linear in 
the range of 0.05-0.3 mg mL-1. The representative linear 
equations between peak area (y) against concentration (x) 
Maurya and Srivastava 471Vol. 23, No. 3, 2012
were Y= 394113x + 513665 (r2 = 0.999) and Y = 353923x + 
450929 (r2 = 0.998). The correlation coefficients were 
greater than 0.99 (r2 > 0.998) indicating high degree of 
correlation and good linearity of the method.
The limit of detection (LOD), which can be detected 
but not necessary quantified under the stated experimental 
condition, were 0.190 and 0.176 µg for UA (1) and UAL (2) 
respectively. The limit of quantification, which can be 
determined with acceptable precision and accuracy, were 
0.644 and 0.587 µg for UA (1) and UAL (2), respectively. 
These results indicate that the method provided adequate 
sensitivity. The intra-day and inter-day precision of the 
method for UA (1) and UAL (2) were measured by peak 
area determination of triterpenoids in triplicate. The low 
value of %RSD (< 2%) reflect the high precision of the 
method. The percentage recoveries for the intra-day 
accuracy were 97.32-98.45 and 96.25-97.51 and those 
for inter-day accuracy were 97.51-98.27 and 96.31-97.15 
for UA (1) and UAL (2) respectively. Both percentage 
recoveries were within 96.3-98.5 indicating good accuracy 
of the method. The method was used to quantify the amount 
of UA (1) and UAL (2) in 5 samples of ethyl acetate extract 
of E. tereticornis leaves. The percentages of UA (1) and 
UAL (2) in the E. tereticornis ethyl acetate extract were 
1.7 ± 0.15% and 0.8 ± 0.04% (m/m), respectively. In our 
method UA has been detected at 16.3 min, while in a 
previous method it was detected at 19.5 min. In this way 
our method has a time advantage of 16.4% over the previous 
method. Another advantage of our method is the low acidic 
pH (3.5) of mobile phase in comparison to the high acidic 
pH (2.8) in the previous method.23 
Conclusions 
In this study, we developed a simple, precise, and 
accurate HPLC method for the simultaneous quantification 
of ursolic acid (1) and ursolic acid lactone (2) in leafs of 
E. tereticornis. The experimental conditions, including 
the mobile phase composition, column temperature and 
flow rate were optimized to provide high resolution and 
reproducible peaks. From preliminary experiments, the best 
results were obtained using a mobile phase of methanol: 
water acidified to pH 3.5 with TFA (88:12, v/v). A flow rate 
of 1 mL min-1 was found to be appropriate for shortening 
the run time without compromising the peak resolution. A 
controlled column temperature of 25 ± 1 ºC was required 
to obtain reproducible results. The method was validated 
in compliance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guideline [ICH-Q2 (R1)]28 and is 
suitable for the simultaneous determination of individual 
triterpenoids in the leaf extract of E. tereticornis with 
excellent precision, accuracy, and linearity. The method 
is isocratic with an uncomplicated mobile phase, and the 
sample preparation and assay procedures are simple and 
rapid. This is for the first time, a HPLC method for the 
quantitative determination of ursolic acid lactone (UAL, 2) 
has been developed with high precision and accuracy. 
Therefore we suggest that this method can be routinely used 
for the analysis of UA (1) and UAL (2) in the extracts and 
formulations containing E. tereticornis leaves.
