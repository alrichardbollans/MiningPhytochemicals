Three sesquiterpenes, 3-O-(3’-acetoxy-2’-hydroxy-2’-methylbutyryl)cuauthemone (1), 4-O-acetylcuauthemone-3-O-angelate (2), 4-O-acetylcuauthemone 3-O-(2’-hydroxy-2’-methyl-3’-acetoxybutyrate) (3) and two flavones, 3’,4’,5,7-tetrahydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyflavone (4), 3’,5,6-trihydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxyflavone (5) were isolated from the aerial parts of Laggera tomentosa. The compounds were characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Complete 1H and 13C NMR assignment of compound 1 was done for the first time. This is the first report on the occurrence of cuauthemone sesquiterpenes in the genus Laggera.   KEY WORDS: Laggera tomentosa, Asteraceae, Cuauthemone sesquiterpenes, 3-O-(3’-acetoxy-2’-hydroxy-2’-methylbutyryl)cuauthemone   INTRODUCTION  Laggera tomentosa (Sch. Bip. ex A. Rich) Oliv & Hiern (Asteraceae) known locally as “keskese”, is a perennial fragment bushy herb (0.5-1.2 m high) endemic to Ethiopia. Traditionally, the juice of the crushed leaves is ingested as a treatment for stomachache, and is used against migraine. It is also used as a fumigant and for cleansing milk containers [1]. There are about 20 species in the genus Laggera and only few have been extensively investigated. Some Laggera species and their constituents exhibit anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity [2]. A number of compounds have been isolated from the Laggera species, the most characteristic of which are the eudesmane sesquiterpenes and flavones [2-5]. Phytochemical studies on the essential oil of L. tomentosa have been reported before [6, 7]. However, there are no reports on the chemical investigation of the solvent extract of this species prior to this work.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The petroleum ether and ethanol extract of the aerial part of L. tomentosa was subjected to exhaustive chromatographic separation which yielded three cuauthemone sesquiterpenes (1-3) and two flavones (4 and 5). These compounds are reported for the first time from L. tomentosa. The compounds, 4-O-acetylcuauthemone-3-O-angelate (2) [8], 4-O-acetylcuauthemone 3-O-(2’-hydroxy-2’-methyl-3’-acetoxybutyrate) (3) [9], 3’,4’,5,7-tetrahydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyflavone (4) [10, 11] and 3’,5,6-trihydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxyflavone (5) [12] (Figure 1) were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with reported values in the literature. The structure of compound 1 was fully characterized in this work based on 1D and 2D-NMR data including DEPT-135, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. Dominguez et al. [13] reported similar structure as 1 for a compound isolated from Pluchea purpurescens and the structure was elucidated from MS, IR and 1H NMR data. The MS and IR data reported are similar with those of compound 1 isolated in this study. However, the 1HNMR assignment by Dominguez et al. is Kibrom Gebrehiwot et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2010, 24(2) 268different from some of the protons reported by us. This prompts us to do comprehensive NMR analysis of compound 1 (Table 1).

The carbon assignments were made using the HSQC spectrum.   13C NMR and DEPT-135 indicated that 1 has 22 carbon atoms: 8 quaternary, 3 methine, 4 methylene and 7 methyl carbons. The spectra also showed one ketone carbonyl at δ 202.1, two ester carbonyls at δ 196.8 and 174.7, and two olefinic carbons at δ 130.5 and 145.9. The H, H- COSY spectrum showed strong correlation between the two protons on C-6 indicating that methylene protons on C-6 are diasteriotopic and C-5 is a stereogenic center. In HMBC spectrum Short Communication Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2010, 24(2) 269methyl protons appearing at δ 0.94 showed correlations with C-10, C-9, C-5 and C-1 indicating CH3-14 is attached to C-10. Moreover, protons on CH3-12 and CH3-13 correlated with the two olefinic carbons (C-7 and C-11) and carbonyl carbon C-8 (Table 1). This observation suggests the presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group which is supported by the UV spectrum. Correlation of H-3 with carbonyl carbon C-1’ indicated the position of the side chain to be C-3. This was also confirmed by hydrolysis experiment which yielded cuauthemone (1a) [14]. The relative configuration of the stereocenters (C-3, 4, 5, and 10) has been defined by comparison with related compound in the literature [14].  Among the 20 Laggera species, L. pterodonta, L.alata, L. crispata and L. decurrens have been extensively investigated and 51 eudesmanes sesquiterpenes and five flavonoids have been reported from these species [2]. The cuauthemone eudesmanes and flavonoids isolated from L. tomentosa have not been reported from the above mentioned species. The cuauthemone eudesmanes are rather characteristic of the genus Pluchea [14], which belong to the same tribe, Plucheeae, as the genus Laggera. This study indicates that L. tomentosa is chemically related to some Pluchea species, due to the co-occurrence of cuauthemone sesquiterpenes, rather than to the Laggera species studied so far. Further studies need to be carried out to establish the chemotaxonomic relationship of the species within the genus Laggera, and between L. tomentosa and Pluchea species. EXPERIMENTAL  General. 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400MHz spectrometer with TMS as internal standard. The ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectra were taken on GENESY’S 2PC UV-Vis scanning spectrometer in the range 200-1000 cm-1. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained on Perkin-Elmer BX Infrared spectrometer using KBr in the range 400-4000 cm-1. Positive ion HR-MS spectrum was recorded on Bruker Micro TOF spectrometer at School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham, UK. Melting points were recorded using Thomas HOOVER Capillary melting point apparatus. TLC analyses were carried out on TLC plates 0.2 mm thick layer of Merck silica gel 60 F254 coated on aluminum foil. Compounds on TLC were detected using UV lamp and spraying with 1% vanillin in sulfuric acid for sesquiterpenes and 5% methanolic KOH solution for flavones.   Plant material. Laggera tomentosa was collected from Daletti, Western Shoa of Ethiopia (26 km far from Addis Ababa, near Alemgena) in November 2005. A voucher specimen (SD 6487) is deposited at the National Herbarium (ETH), Department of Biology, Addis Ababa University.   Extraction and isolation. The dried and milled aerial parts of L. tomentosa (500 g) were extracted by maceration with petroleum ether (54-93 °C) at room temperature for 24 hours, and then evaporated in vacuo to yield 22.8 g crude extract. The residue was then soaked with ethanol twice at room temperature for up to 24 hours each and then evaporated in vacuo to yield 54 g solid material. The dried petroleum ether extract (22.8 g) was chromatographed over a column packed with 200 g silica gel using petroleum ether containing increasing amounts of EtOAc as solvents and 40 fractions were collected. The fractions were monitored by TLC and combined to 17 fractions. Fraction 8 (pet-ether/EtOAc, 7:3) after cleaning up on Sephadex LH-20 column [eluent, CHCl3/MeOH (2:1)] was further purified on a silica gel column [eluent, pet-ether/EtOAc (7:3)] to yield compound 2 (28 mg). Fraction 17, after cleanup on Sephadex LH-20, [CHCl3/MeOH (2:1)] and further fractionation on a silica gel column as above gave compound 3 (32 mg). About 20 g of the ethanol extract was applied to a silica gel CC and eluted with CHCl3/MeOH in increasing polarity. A total of 29 fractions were collected and combined in to 12 fractions on the bases of similar TLC profile.  Kibrom Gebrehiwot et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2010, 24(2) 270Fraction 4, after cleanup on a Sephadex LH-20 column [CHCl3/MeOH (2:1)] and further fractionation on a silica gel column [CHCl3/EtOAc (9:1)] gave a fraction which on further purification using chromatotron (CHCl3/MeOH; 40:1) afforded compound 1 (163 mg). Fraction 5 was passed through Sephadex LH-20 [CHCl3/MeOH (2:1)] and upon further purification on a silica gel column (using CHCl3/MeOH; 20:1) and  chromatotron (CHCl3/MeOH; 20:1) to afford 4 (43 mg) and 5 (38 mg).  3-O-(3’-Acetoxy-2’-hydroxy-2’-methylbutyryl)cuauthemone (1).
