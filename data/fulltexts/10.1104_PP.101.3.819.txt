Root exudates of alfalfa (Medicago sativa 1.) inoculated with 
symbiotic Rhizobium meliloti bacteria contained three isoflavo- 
noids that were not found in exudates of uninoculated plants. Data 
from proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and 
ultraviolet-visible absorbance analyses indicated that root exudates 
of inoculated plants contained aglycone and glycoside forms of the 
phytoalexin medicarpin and a formononetin-7-0-(6”-0-malonyl- 
glycoside), a conjugated form of the medicarpin precursor formo- 
nonetin. lhe medicarpin molecules did not induce nod gene 
transcription in R. meliloti, but the formononetin-7-0-(6”-O-ma- 
lonylglycoside) induced nod genes regulated by both NodDl and 
NodD2 proteins in R. meliloti. Hydrolysis of either the malonyl or 
the glycosyl linkage from the formononetin conjugate eliminated 
nod gene-inducing activity. lhe nod gene-inducing activity of crude 
root exudates was increased 200 and 65% upon inoculation with 
R. meliloti or R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli, respectively. When 
root exudate from uninoculated alfalfa was incubated with R. 
meliloti, high performance liquid chromatography analyses showed 
no evidence that bacterial metabolism produced medicarpin. These 
results indicate that alfalfa responds to symbiotic R. meliloti by 
exuding a phytoalexin normally elicited by pathogens and that the 
microsymbiont can use a precursor of the phytoalexin as a signal 
for inducing symbiotic nod genes. 
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) grown in the absence of its N2- 
fixing symbiont Rhizobium meliloti releases five flavonoids 
(Peters et al., 1986; Maxwell et al., 1989; Hartwig et al., 
1990a) and two betaines (Phillips et al., 1992) that induce 
transcription of nodulation (nod) genes in that bacterium. 
Studies with white clover (Rolfe et al., 1988) and Vicia sativa 
subsp. nigra (van Brussel et al., 1990) showed that inoculating 
with an infective rhizobial symbiont increased nod gene- 
inducing activity associated with the root by as much as 10- 
fold. Analyses of the Vicia root exudates identified eight nod 
gene-inducing flavonoids that increased in the presence of 
Rhizobium, but there was no evidence that Vicia inoculated 
with R. leguminosarum bv viciae released other new com- 
pounds that failed to induce nod genes (Recourt et al., 1991). 
Whether alfalfa roots release additional nod gene-inducers in 
the presence of R. meliloti is unknown.

Microbes often elicit phytoalexins in legumes (Dixon, 
1986), but the role of these compounds in development of 
N2-fixing root nodules is unclear. Soybeans (Glycine max [L.] 
Merr.) infected with Bradyrhizobium japonicum produce the 
isoflavonoid phytoalexin glyceollin (Pamiske et al., 1990), 
and B. japonicum cells develop resistance to that compound 
when exposed to its biosynthetic precursors (Pamiske et al., 
1991; Kape et al., 1992). The fact that there is no evidence 
that Vicia roots treated with Rhizobium exuded isoflavonoid 
phytoalexins (Recourt et al., 1991) is intriguing because many 
of the Rhizobium-dependent compounds that appeared were 
5-deoxy flavonoids that could be metabolized to medicarpin, 
a common phytoalexin in V. faba (Hargreaves et al., 1976). 
Alfalfa cells treated with elicitors from a pathogen produce 
medicarpin (Kessmann et al., 1990), but whether R. meliloti 
induces alfalfa to exude medicarpin has not been reported. 
The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence 
of R. meliloti around alfalfa roots alters the composition of 
root exudates either by increasing the amount of nod gene- 
inducing activity or by promoting exudation of phytoalexins. 
MATERIALS A N D  M E T H O D S  
Plant Culture 
”Moapa 69” alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seeds were scarified, 
surface-sterilized, allowed to imbibe, and grown under con- 
trolled conditions (Maxwell et al., 1989). Rhizobium meliloti 
strain 102F28 and R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli strain 4292 
cells were cultured in tryptone-yeast extract (Beringer, 1974) 
and yeast extract-mannitol (Vincent, 1970) media, respec- 
tively, and rinsed cells were inoculated into hydroponic so- 
lution surrounding roots of 24-h-old seedlings to produce 
suspensions with ODboo = 0.025. Uninoculated controls re- 
ceived sterile nutrient solution (Maxwell et al., 1989). Solu- 
tions bathing roots, termed root exudates, were collected 2 to 
9 d later (3-10 d after imbibition) and frozen at -8OOC. 
Tests for bacterial metabolism of exudate compounds used 
root exudate from 72-h-old uninoculated seedlings. R. meliloti 
102F28 cells were suspended in the exudate (OD600 = 0.040) 
for 72 h and removed by centrifuging to supply exudate 
samples for HPLC analyses.

Biological Activities 
The nod gene-inducing capacity of root exudate and specific 
compounds was assayed as P-galactosidase activity (Miller, 
1972) transcribed from a nodC-lacZ fusion with its associated 
nodDl gene on plasmid pRmM57 in R. meliloti strain 1021 
(Mulligan and Long, 1985). Two other strains, JM57pRmJ30 
and JM57pRmM137, which contained a nodC-lacZ fusion on 
pSym (JM57; Mulligan and Long, 1985) plus nodDl on mul- 
tiple copies of pRmJ30 (Jacobs et al., 1985) or nodD2 on 
multiple copies of pRmM137 (Fisher et al., 1988), were used 
to test for apparent activation of NodDl and NodD2 proteins 
as reported previously (Hartwig et al., 1990a; Phillips et al., 
1992). Activity of an uninduced control was subtracted. 
Strains were generously donated by Dr. S.R. Long, Stanford 
University (Stanford, CA). 
Purification of Flavonoids from Root Exudates 
Fresh or thawed root exudate was centrifuged at 6200g for 
15 min and passed through 0.8- and 0.2-pm polycarbonate 
filters (Nuclepore Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Aliquots (50 mL) 
were adsorbed to 900-mg Cls Maxi-Clean cartridges (Alltech 
Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). Flavonoids from each car- 
tridge were eluted with acetone, freeze-dried, and dissolved 
in 50% MeOH for HPLC analysis. Initial HPLC separations 
used a 250 X 4.6 mm Lichrosorb 5RP18 column (Phenome- 
nex, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA), which was rinsed from O to 
65 min with a linear gradient (0:99:1 to 99:O:l [v:v:v] 
Me0H:water:acetic acid) and isocratically from 65 to 90 min 
with 99:l Me0H:acetic acid at rate of 0.5 mL min-’. Larger 
scale purification protocols used a 250 X 10 mm Lichrosorb 
5RP18 semi-preparative column (Alltech Associates, Inc.) 
eluted at 2 mL min-’. A11 eluates were monitored for absorb- 
ance at 260 to 400 nm with a photodiode array detector. 
Closely eluting compounds were purified by additional HPLC 
chromatography using appropriate MeOH concentrations. 
ldentification of lsoflavonoids 
UV-visible spectral shift analyses (Mabry et al., 1970) were 
made with a Lambda 6 dual-beam spectrophotometer 
(Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). ‘H-NMR experiments were 
done in [U-’H]MeOH on a GN-300 Omega NMR spectrom- 
eter (General Electric Co., Fremont, CA), and spectra were 
referenced to tetramethylsilane. FAB-MS data were collected 
with a ZAB-HS-2F mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, Wy- 
thenshawe, UK) using positive ionization (xenon, 8 keV, 1 
mA) with a VG Dynamic FAB probe. Samples were dissolved 
in MeOH and injected with 95:5 (v/v) water:glycerol at a 
flow rate of 5 p L  min-’. 
Hydrolysates of purified flavonoids were prepared either 
by treating with 2.0 N HCl at 100°C for 1 h (acid or strong 
hydrolysis) or by incubating in 0.75 N NaOH at room tem- 
perature for 1 h under N2 (alkaline or mild hydrolysis). In 
each case, the mixture was neutralized, freeze-dried, sus- 
pended in 50% MeOH, and centrifuged before repurifying 
by HPLC for further analyses. 
Concentrations of isoflavonoids and their conjugates were 
estimated in ethanol using log t = 4.44 at 250 nm for 
formononetin (Budavari, 1989) and log e = 3.90 at 287 nm 
for medicarpin (Smith et al., 1971). 
RESULTS 
lnoculation Effects on Flavonoids in Root Exudate 
Inoculating roots of 24-h-old alfalfa seedlings with either 
R. meliloti or R.1. bv phaseoli increased total nod gene-inducing 
activity of root exudates significantly within 48 h, and the 
effects remained evident for several days (Fig. 1). On day 5, 
the increase in nod gene-inducing activity over uninoculated 
controls was 200% for R. meliloti and 65% for R.1. bv phaseoli. 
Alfalfa root exudates were altered reproducibly in several 
experiments by both bacterial species, but a11 further studies 
were done with the normal alfalfa symbiont R. meliloti. 
HPLC chromatograms of the flavonoid fraction from root 
exudates of plants exposed to R. meliloti were distinctly 
different from comparable eluents of uninoculated plants 
(Fig. 2). Peaks a, b, and c were easily identified by their UV- 
visible spectra, retention times, and relative nod gene-induc- 
ing activities as 4’,7-dihydroxyflavanone, 4,4’-dihydroxy-2’- 
methoxy-chalcone, and 4’,7-dihydroxyflavone, which were 
identified previously in exudates of uninoculated alfalfa seed- 
lings (Maxwell et al., 1989). Peaks 1, 2, and 3, which were 
not evident in exudate from uninoculated plants, were chosen 
for further study because of either their nod gene-inducing 
activity (only peak 1) or their size (peaks 2 and 3). Although 
chromatograms from different experiments showed the same 
qualitative effects of rhizobial inoculation, differences in the 
heights of peaks 1, 2, and 3 from various experiments im- 
paired efforts to quantify changes in the amounts of various 
flavonoids. The dangers associated with such attempts were 
emphasized by the fact that although peak 1 was often very 
small in chromatograms of root exudate (Fig. 2B), additional 
amounts of the compound were obtained by rinsing the inside 
surface of the root container with 50% MeOH. Compounds

ylglycoside), a medicarpin-3-O-glycoside, and medicarpin. 
in peaks 2 and 3 did not adhere to containers, and thus only 
small amounts of those molecules were available. 
Compound ldentifications 
Absorbance measurements of peak 1 produced a UV- 
visible spectrum, A,,,, MeOH at 203, 230, 249, 259, and 304 
nm, similar to formononetin-7-O-glucoside (Mabry et al., 
1970), and spectral shift experiments gave no evidence of 
free hydroxyl groups. The aglycone produced by acid hy- 
drolysis of peak 1 gave UV-visible absorbance and shift 
results comparable to published data for formononetin (Ma- 
bry et al., 1970) and identical to authentic formononetin. 
Unhydrolyzed peak 1 had the following proton resonances: 
bH ppm ([U-2H]MeOH); 8.28 (lH, s, H-2), 8.16 (lH, d, J = 8.6 
Hz, H-5), 7.50 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-2’,6’), 7.29 (lH, S, H- 
8), 7.21 (lH, dd, J = 2.4, 8.6 Hz, H-6), 7.00 (2H, d, J = 8.5 
Hz, H-3’,5’), 5.11 (lH, d, J = 3.7 Hz, H-1”), 4.55 (lH, d, J = 
11 Hz, H-6”a), 4.26 (lH, dd, 1 = 6.7, 11 Hz, H-6”b), 3.84 
(3H, s, OCH3), 3.6 to 3.4 (4H, m, H-2”-5”). FAB-MS analyses 
produced major ions at m/z = 517,431, and 269, which were 
consistent with MH’ values calculated for a formononetin- 
malonylglycoside, a formononetin-glycoside, and formono- 
netin, respectively. 
When peak 1 was hydrolyzed with alkali, the ‘H-NMR 
spectrum was comparable to the unhydrolyzed sample except 
that the H-6”a signal was shifted to 4.02 ppm (lH, d, J = 11 
Hz) and the H-6”b signal shifted to 3.81 ppm (lH, dd, J = 
6.1, 12 Hz). FAB-MS analyses of the alkali-treated sample 
showed major ions at m/z = 431 and 269, which were 
consistent with MH* values of formononetin-7-O-glucoside 
and formononetin. Upfield shifts in the 6“a and 6”b proton 
signals indicated that the malonyl group was attached at the 
C-6” position (Matern et al., 1983; Kudou et al., 1991). 
Malonyl protons could not be detected in the solvent used in 
this study (Matem et al., 1983). 
When peak 1 was hydrolyzed in acid, the ‘H-NMR spec- 
trum showed no sugar signals and was identical to that of 
formononetin (Maxwell and Phillips, 1990). The four signals 
in the 7.0 to 6.85 ppm range could be assigned to individual 
protons after comparison with the unhydrolyzed sample: 6.97 
6), 6.84 (lH, s, H-8). Upfield shifts in the H-6 and H-8 proton 
signals were consistent with hydrolysis of a formononetin-7- 
O-glycoside linkage. FAB-MS analysis gave a molecular ion 
signal at m/z = 269, which corresponded to MH+ of formo- 
nonetin. ‘H-NMR and MS tests with authentic formononetin- 
7-O-glucoside and formononetin gave data identical to those 
recorded for alkali- and acid-hydrolysates of peak 1. On the 
basis of those results, it was concluded that peak 1 was a 
formononetin-7-O-(6”-O-malonylglycoside) (Fig. 3), which 
was previously identified in roots of six legumes (Koster et 
al., 1983). Only limited amounts of the compound were 
available, and identification of the sugar moiety was not 
feasible. 
Absorbance measurements of peak 2 produced a UV- 
visible spectrum, A,,,, MeOH at 206, 281, 286, and 308 nm, 
similar to medicarpin (Smith et al., 1971). Unhydrolyzed 
peak 2 had the following proton resonances: dH ppm 
([U-’HIMeOH); 7.39 (lH, d, J = 8.3 Hz, H-l), 7.16 (lH, d, J 
(2H, d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-3’,5’), 6.92 (lH, dd, J = 2.4, 8.5 Hz, H- 
= 8.3 Hz, H-7), 6.78 (lH, dd, J = 2.3, 8.7 Hz, H-2), 6.62 (lH, 
d, J = 2.3 Hz, H-4), 6.43 (lH, dd, J = 2.3, 8.3 Hz, H-8), 6.37 
(lH, d, J = 1.8 Hz, H-10), 5.49 (lH, d, J = 5.5 Hz, H-lla), 
4.24 (lH, d, J = 5.5 Hz, H-64, 3.86 (lH, d ,  J = 12 Hz, sugar 
H), 3.72 (3H, s, -OCH3), 3.70 to 3.64 (lH, m, sugar H), 3.55 
(lH, d,  J = 6.0 Hz, H-6,,), 3.52 (lH, m, H-6a), 3.45 to 3.35 
(5H, m, sugar H). These values were consistent with those 
reported for medicarpin (Smith et al., 1971) and closely.

related molecules (Spencer et al., 1991), except for the down- 
field shift of the H-2 and H-4 signals, which indicated 
3-O-glycosylation. Magnifying the spectrum suggested that 
additional details (e.g. a probable dd at 4.24 ppm) were 
comparable to published values for medicarpin, but the small 
amount of sample limited NMR resolution. FAB-MS analyses 
showed major ions at m/z = 433, 271, 270, and 269. Those 
ions are consistent with MH” values calculated for medicar- 
pin glycoside, 433, and medicarpin, 271. The cluster of ions 
at m/z = 271, 270, and 269 was observed for authentic 
medicarpin analyzed under the same conditions. When the 
remainder of the sample purified from peak 2 was hydrolyzed 
in acid, the amount recovered was insufficient for further 
eanalysis. 
Heights of HPLC peaks 2 and 3 (Fig. 2) were inversely 
related, and generally more of peak 2 was present than peak 
3. As a result, insufficient amounts of peak 3 were recovered 
for NMR measurements. Peak 3 gave a UV absorbance 
spectrum, A,,,, MeOH at 206, 280, 286, and 308 nm and a 
retention time on the HPLC in the standard gradient system 
that were identical to authentic medicarpin. Given the defi- 
nite identification of peak, 2 as a glycoside of medicarpin, 
these data supported a conclusion that peak 3 contained 
medicarpin aglycone. 
nod Cene-lnducing Activity 
Assays for nod gene induction in R. meliloti 1021pRmM57 
showed that intact formononetin-7-O-(6”-O-malonylglyco- 
side) produced an IS0 value of approximately 300 nM, whereas 
both acidic and alkaline hydrolysis essentially inactivated the 
molecule (Fig. 4). Because hydrolyzed samples were analyzed 
by ‘H-NMR and FAB-MS before being assayed (data listed 
above), it was possible to conclude that removing either the 
malonyl or the malonylglycosyl portion of the molecule 
severely restricted activity of the intact compound. Those 
results were supported by direct assays with authentic for- 
mononetin, formononetin-7-O-glucoside, malonate, and for- 
mononetin-7-O-glucoside plus malonate, which gave no nod 
gene-inducing ~. .- activity in R. meliloti 1021pRmM57. Control 
assays with the same strain showed that for luteolin 150 = 
100 nM and Imax = 230 P-galactosidase units. 
When the intact formononetin-7-O-(6”-O-malonylglyco- 
side) was tested for nod gene induction in derivatives of R. 
meliloti strain JM57 that contained extra copies of nodDl or 
nodD2 genes, the compound showed an apparent activation 
of both NodDl and NodD2 regulatory proteins (Fig. 5). 
Luteolin (10 nM), a positive control for NodDl activation, 
produced 40 units of P-galactosidase activity, and trigonelline 
(10 PM), a positive control for NodD2 activation, produced 
51 units of P-galactosidase activity. Repeated assays con- 
firmed that the compound was active with both nodD genes. 
Effects of Bacterial Metabolism 
Incubating root exudate from uninoculated plants with R. 
meliloti cells did not completely establish whether peaks 1, 
2, and 3 (Fig. 2B) were plant or bacterial products. UV 
absorbance analyses of HPLC eluents from root exudates 
after incubating with bacteria away from the root never 
showed’ any evidence of either medicarpin molecule (peaks 
2 and 3), but bacteria did affect the amounts and types of 
formononetin derivatives present in the exudate. HPLC peaks 
with formononetin-like UV spectra showed different reten- 
tion times after incubation with bacteria. Those changes were 
consistent with modifications in hydrophobicity that would 
be produced by bacterial hydrolysis of malonyl or glycosyl 
groups. There was no evidence of increases in total formo- 
nonetin-like compounds in the presence of bacteria. We 
conclude that bacteria do not synthesize medicarpin in the 
exudate but may modify formononetin conjugates.

Alfalfa Root Exudates in the Presence of Rhizobium 823 
exudate (Fig. 1) and caused at least three additional com- 
pounds to appear (Fig. 2). Those three isoflavonoids (Fig. 3) 
are formed by many legumes. Isoflavonoid glycosides with 
6”-O-malonylation have been isolated from at least 10 leg- 
umes (Beck and Knox, 1971; Koster et al., 1983; Kudou et al., 
1991; Shibuya et al., 1991)’ including alfalfa (Kessman et al., 
1990). Because roots of 6 legumes contained formononetin- 
7-O-(6”-O-malonylglucoside) (Koster et al., 1983) and a11 
isoflavonoid glycosides in alfalfa roots contained Glc (Kess- 
man et al., 1990), it is reasonable to expect that the small 
amounts of the nod gene-inducing formononetin-7-0-(6”-0- 
malonylglycoside) purified in this study contained Glc. Med- 
icarpin is an isoflavonoid phytoalexin that can be elicited by 
pathogenic microbes in alfalfa (Smith et al., 1971) and Vicia 
(Hargreaves et al., 1976), but there is no report that microbial 
symbionts elicit the compound in legumes. Thus, our obser- 
vation offers new insight into the parallel responses elicited 
in alfalfa by pathogens and a rhizobial symbiont. Growth of 
one strain of R. meliloti is not inhibited by medicarpin (Pank- 
hurst and Biggs, 1980), so it may be possible that the symbiont 
gains a selective advantage over other microbes by stimulat- 
ing the plant to release this phytoalexin. 
Flavonoid changes in alfalfa root exudate after inoculation 
differed from those reported for Vicia. The nod gene-inducing 
activity in alfalfa root exudates was increased by the presence 
of both infective and noninfective rhizobia (Fig. l), whereas 
only infective rhizobia had that effect on Vicia (van Brussel 
et al., 1990; Recourt et al., 1992). Vicia responded to the 
presence of infective rhizobia by releasing eight nod gene- 
inducing flavanones and chalcones but no isoflavonoid phy- 
toalexins (Recourt et al., 1991). In contrast, only one new nod 
gene inducer was identified in alfalfa root exudate, but the 
phytoalexin medicarpin appeared in detectable quantities. 
The Vicia response to Rhizobium involved an increase in Phe 
ammonia lyase activity and chalcone synthase mRNA (Re- 
court et al., 1992). Whether the isoflavonoids identified 
in alfalfa root exudate originated from de novo synthesis 
or modification of existing compounds remains to be 
determined. 
The 200% increase in total nod gene-inducing activity on 
day 5 for plants inoculated with R. meliloti (Fig. 1) probably 
cannot be attributed solely to the presence of formononetin- 
7-O-(6”-O-malonylglycoside). Comparisons indicate that this 
compound is a weaker nod gene inducer in R. meliloti 
1021pRmM57 than luteolin. The 4,4‘-dihydroxy-2‘-meth- 
oxychalcone in root exudate of both inoculated and uninoc- 
ulated alfalfa (Fig. 2, peak b) is a stronger inducer than 
luteolin (Maxwell et al., 1989), but 4‘,7-&hydroxyflavone 
(Fig. 2, peak c) can inhibit activity of the chalcone (Hartwig 
et al., 1989). Thus, a decline in 4’,7-dihydroxyflavone after 
R. meliloti inoculation may have contributed to the increase 
in total nod gene-inducing activity of the crude exudate (Fig. 
1). The decrease in 4’,7-dihydroxyflavone in the exudate is 
consistent with the observed increase in isoflavonoids be- 
cause this compound is an important storage product in 
young alfalfa roots and a major portion of this compound 
exuded by alfalfa roots is closely linked to concurrent syn- 
thesis (Maxwell and Phillips, 1990). Presumably, redirecting 
carbon flow in that biosynthesis to isoflavonoids would de- 
crease 4’,7-dihydroxyflavone in the exudate. 
Formononetin-7-O-(6”-O-malonylglycoside) isolated in 
this study is only the second reported nod gene-inducing 
molecule that apparently activates both NodDl and NodD2 
regulatory proteins in R. meliloti (Fig. 5). The other com- 
pound, 4,4’-dihydroxy-2’-methoxychalcone, also induced 
nod  genes in both R. meliloti strains JM57pRmJ30 and 
JM57pRmM137 (Hartwig et al., 1990b), but in the present 
case, it was the 6”-O-malonyl conjugate, not the flavonoid 
alone, that was responsible for activity (Fig. 4). The functions 
of these molecules in different regulatory pathways (i.e. 
NodDl versus NodD2) remain to be defined (Fisher and 
Long, 1992). The ecological significance of formononetin-7- 
O-glycosides may be considerable because rhizosphere soil 
from alfalfa roots contains severa1 closely related molecules 
with nod gene-inducing activity (LeÓn-Bamos et al., 1993). 
Indeed, it now appears that formononetin conjugates that 
coeluted with nod gene-inducing activity in alfalfa root ex- 
tracts (Maxwell and Phillips, 1990) may have been related to 
compound 1 in this study and to the formononetin glycoside 
detected in rhizosphere soil extracts. Although we correctly 
concluded that formononetin was not an active nod gene 
inducer (Maxwell and Phillips, 1990), it may now be instruc- 
tive to characterize those formononetin conjugates in root 
extracts more completely.
