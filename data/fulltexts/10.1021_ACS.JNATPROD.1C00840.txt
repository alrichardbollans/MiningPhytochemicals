The activity was tracked by HPLC-based activity profiling, and four known (2, 3, 4, and 8) and five newclerodane-type diterpenoids (1, 5−7, and 9) were isolated. Compounds 1−8 were obtained from the active time window. Theabsolute configuration of all compounds was established by ECD. Compounds 3, 7, and 8 exhibited EC50 values of 0.5, 4.6, and 1.4μM, respectively. To explore possible binding sites at the receptor, the most abundant diterpenoid 8 was tested in combination withdiazepam, etazolate, and allopregnanolone. An additive potentiation of the GABA signal was observed with these compounds, whilethe effect of 8 was not inhibited by flumazenil, a negative allosteric modulator at the benzodiazepine binding site. Finally, the activitywas validated in voltage clamp studies on Xenopus laevis oocytes transiently expressing GABAA receptors of the α1β2γ2S and α1β2subtypes. Compound 8 potentiated GABA-induced currents with both receptor subunit compositions [EC50 (α1β2γ2S) = 43.6 μM;Emax = 809% and EC50 (α1β2) = 57.6 μM; Emax = 534%]. The positive modulation of GABA-induced currents was not inhibited byflumazenil, thereby confirming an allosteric modulation independent of the benzodiazepine binding site.The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammaliancentral nervous system (CNS) is γ-aminobutyric acid(GABA).1,2 GABA type A (GABAA) receptors play animportant role in modulating excitatory signals in the CNS.These are ion channels, which, upon opening, are permeable tochloride ions. A total of 19 GABAA receptor subunits havebeen identified [six α, three β, three γ, δ, ε, θ, and π, and threeρ subunits], which assemble to numerous pentamers. Thesesubtypes differ with respect to their distribution in the CNSand in their sensitivity to various ligands.3 The most abundantGABAA receptor subtype consists of two α1 subunits, two β2subunits, and one γ2 subunit. Besides binding sites for theendogenous neurotransmitter, GABAA receptors possessseveral allosteric binding sites, such as the benzodiazepine,barbiturate, alcohol, and neurosteroid binding sites.4−6 GABAAreceptors are the target for anxiolytic, hypnotic, anesthetic, andanticonvulsant drugs.6Various assay formats have been exploited for the discoveryof GABAA receptor ligands, such as radioimmunoassays,fluorescent labeling, radioactivity-based flux, and micro-physiometry assays.4,7−9 Two-microelectrode electrophysio-logical assays with Xenopus laevis oocytes transiently expressingthe GABAA receptors of desired subunit composition havebeen used widely for the functional assessment of allostericmodulators, and larval zebrafish locomotor assays have servedfor the in vivo characterization of natural products.10−13 Werecently validated a FLIPR (fluorometric imaging plate reader)assay for the screening of plant extract libraries and thediscovery of allosteric GABAA receptor modulators in suchextracts.14 The assay allows for an observation of real-timemembrane potential changes associated with activation of theion channel.15 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stablyReceived: September 3, 2021Published: April 27, 2022Articlepubs.acs.org/jnp© 2022 The Authors.

(Salicaceae) is a tree distributedin the Mesoamerican region between Mexico and Venezuela.So far, clerodane-type diterpenes possessing insect antifeedantand other biological activities have been identified from thisspecies.17 We here report on the activity-directed identificationof diterpenoids acting as allosteric GABAA receptor modulatorsand on experiments characterizing the allosteric binding site ofthe major active compound.■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA library of 708 ethyl acetate extracts from plants was screenedwith the aid of a recently validated FLIPR assay using stablytransfected CHO cells expressing GABAA receptors of α1β2γ2subunit composition.14 The EtOAc extract from leaves ofCasearia corymbosa potentiated the GABA signal in aconcentration-dependent manner, reaching >75% at 20 μg/mL (Figure S1, Supporting Information). HPLC-based activityprofiling17,18 of the active extract enabled the localization ofthe main activity in microfraction F6 and, to a lesser extent, inF5 (Figure 1).The extract was submitted to preparative columnchromatography on silica gel, and 20 fractions were collected.All fractions were analyzed by HPLC-PDA-ELSD-ESIMS,whereby fractions 8−10 were found to contain compoundslocalized in the active time windows. These fractions werefurther separated by semipreparative HPLC, and compounds1−9 were obtained. Of these, 1−8 were located in the activetime windows of F5 and F6 (Figure 1).Four compounds corresponded to the previously reportedgraveospene H (2) and corymbotins A (8), D (3), and F(4).17,20 They were all clerodane-type diterpenes with a decalinmoiety, a branched side chain at C-9, and four remainingcarbons attached to C-4, C-5, C-8, and C-9.21 However, theabsolute configurations of 3, 4, and 8 have not been reportedpreviously. A comparison of their ECD spectra with those ofclerodane-type diterpenes from Casearia graveolens20 estab-lished the absolute configurations of 3 and 8 as( 2 S , 5 S , 6 S , 8 R , 9 R , 1 0 S , 1 8 R , 1 9 S ) a n d a s(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19S) for compound 4 (Figures S27and S28, Supporting Information).Compound 1 gave a molecular formula of C22H30O5[HRESIMS m/z 397.1987 [M + Na]+; calcd forC22H30O5Na+, 397.1986]. Based on the 1H and 2D NMRspectroscopic data (Table 1), the skeleton of 1 was establishedas a clerodane diterpene with, as for corymbotins A, D, and F(8, 3, and 4), a Δ3,4 double bond [δH 6.89 (H-3), δc 151.3 (C-3); δc 145.9 (C-4)] and a branched six-carbon side chain witha conjugated diene attached to C-9 [δH 2.00 and 2.19 (H2-11),δC 31.2 (C-11); δH 5.27 (H-12), δC 126.2 (C-12); δC 137.1(C-13); δH 6.37 (H-14), δC 141.3 (C-14); δH 5.11 and 4.95Figure 1.

Nat. Prod. 2022, 85, 1201−12101202(H2-15), δC 111.0 (C-15); and δH 1.72 (H3-16), δC 12.0 (C-16)]. In addition, the NMR spectra indicated the presence oftwo formyl groups [δH 9.40 (H-18), δC 194.5 (C-18) and δH10.00 (H-19), δC 202.1 (C-19)]. HMBC correlations from H-18 to C-3 (δC 151.3), C-4 (δC 145.9), and C-5 (δC 56.2) andfrom H-19 to C-5 (δC 56.2) and C-6 (δC 73.1) (Figure 2)showed that they are attached to C-4 and C-5, respectively. AnHMBC correlation from H-2′ (δH 2.12) to C-2 (δC 69.9) andC-1′ (δC 170.0) confirmed the attachment of an acetoxymoiety at C-2. The relative configuration of 1 was establishedon the basis of diagnostic NOESY cross-peaks between H-2and H-10, H-10 and H-19, H-19 and H-11, H-20 and H-1α,H-1β and H-6, H-1β and H-8, and H-6 and H-8. The absoluteconfiguration was determined by a comparison of experimentaland calculated ECD spectra of the (2S,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S)stereoisomer (Figure 3). Two negative Cotton effects (CEs)at 216 nm (Δε −7.8) and 239 nm (Δε −7.5) indicated theabsolute configuration of 1 as (2S,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S), and thestructure of this new compound was thus established as(5S,8R,9R,10S)-2S-acetoxy-6S-hydroxyclerod-3,12,14-trien-18,19-dial.Compound 5 gave a molecular formula of C23H32O5(HRESIMS m/z 411.2145 [M + Na]+, calcd forC23H32O5Na+, 411.2142). The NMR data were very similarto those of 1. The major difference was in a methoxy group [δH3.32 and δC 57.1 ppm] that showed an HMBC correlation withC-6 (δC 82.6) (Figure 2). The relative configuration wasestablished based on NOESY correlations between H-2 and H-10, H-10 and H-19, H-19 and H-6, H-1β and H-6, H-6 and H-8, H-17 and H-11, and H-1α and H-20. The ECD spectrumresembled that of 1, as it showed two negative Cotton effects at215 nm (Δε −5.6) and 237 nm (Δε −6.3). The spectrummatched with the calculated ECD spectrum of the(2S,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S) stereoisomer (Figure 3), and thestructure of 5 was thus established as (5S,8R,9R,10S)-2S-acetoxy-6S-methoxyclerod-3,12,14-trien-18,19-dial, a new nat-ural product.A molecular formula of C27H38O7 was calculated for 6(HRESIMS m/z 497.2514 [M + Na]+, calcd for C27H38O7Na+,497.2510). The 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data indicateda structure similar to graveospene H (2). However, the acetoxyresidue in 2 was replaced by a methacryloxy moiety [δC 166.7(C-1′); δC 136.7 (C-2’); δH 5.58 and 6.12 (H2-3′), δC 125.2(C-3′); δH 1.98 (H3-4′), δC 18.0 (C-4′)], while an HMBCcross-peak between H-2 (δH 5.51) and C-1′ (Figure 2)indicated the attachment at C-2. NOESY cross-peaks betweenH-10 and H-20, H-8 and H-20, H-11 and H-17, H-6 and H-8,H-6 and H-19, H-6 and H-18, H-18 and H-19, and H-8 and H-20 were used to establish the relative configuration of thescaffold. The absolute configuration was determined byECD.18 The positive CE at 207 nm (Δε +29.9), togetherwith a negative CE at 232 nm (Δε −9.0) (Figure S27,S u p p o r t i n g I n f o r m a t i o n ) i n d i c a t e d a(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18S,19S) configuration. Diterpenoid 6was thus identified as (2R,6S,18S,19S)-2-methylpropenoy-loxy-6-hydroxy-18-methoxy-19-acetoxyzuelanin, a new naturalproduct.The structure of 7 was established with the aid of HRESIMS(m/z 541.2409 [M + Na]+, calcd for C28H38O9Na+, 541.2408)and 1D and 2D NMR data (Table 2, Figure 2). The NMR dataindicated that it was similar to 3 but with an acetoxy moiety(δH 2.08, δC 21.1; δC 170.1) instead of a hydroxy group at C-6.The relative configuration was determined based on NOESYcross-peaks between H-1α and H-20, H-1β and H-6, H-2 andH-10, H-6 and H-8, H-6 and H-18, H-6 and H-19, H-8 and H-20, and H-11 and H-17. The ECD spectrum showed twonegative CEs at 196 (Δε −12.5) and 230 (Δε −12.5) nm(Figure S28, Supporting Information), indicating a(2S,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18S,19S) configuration. Thus, the struc-ture of 7 was established as (2S,6S,18S,19S)-tetraacetoxyzue-lanin, a new natural product.Compound 9 (HRESIMS m/z 527.2618 [M + Na]+, calcdfor C28H40O8Na+, 527.2616) gave a molecular formula ofC28H40O8. 1D and 2D NMR data (Table 2, Figure 2) closelyresembled those of 8, the only difference being in the presenceof a propylate residue at C-2 [δC 173.8 (C-1′); δH 2.42 (H2-3′), δC 27.9 (C-2′); δH 1.21 (H3-3′), δC 9.1 (C-3′)]. NOESYcorrelations between H-6 and H-8, H-8 and H-20, H-10 andH-20, H3CO-6 and H-19, H3CO-6 and H-18, and H-18 andH-19 established the relative configuration, and CEs at 202Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopic Data forCompounds 1 and 5a1 5position δCb, type δH (J in Hz) δCb, type δH (J in Hz)1α 25.6,CH22.22c 25.9,CH22.16, m1β 1.67, dd (10.4, 2.1) 1.63, m2 69.9, CH 5.64, ddd (10.5, 6.6,2.1)70.2, CH 5.59, ddd (10.5,6.6, 2.1)3 151.3,CH6.89, br s 143.2,CH6.73, br s4 145.9, C - 147.1, C -5 56.2, C - 55.1, C -6 73.1, CH 3.96, br dd (11.4,5.7)82.6, CH 3.52, m7 37.4,CH21.96c 32.4,CH21.76c2.05, m8 35.6, CH 1.81, m 35.7, CH 1.77c9 39.5, C - 39.8, C -10 44.4, CH 2.29, dd (13.7, 2.1) 44.5, CH 2.40, dd (14.0,2.4)11 31.2,CH22.00c 31.2,CH21.73c2.19c 2.25, dd (15.9,8.5)12 126.2,CH5.27, br t (6.9) 126.3,CH5.27, m13 137.1, C - 136.7, C -14 141.3,CH6.37, dd (17.2, 10.8) 141.6,CH6.39, dd (17.4,10.7)15 111.0,CH24.95, d (11.0) 110.7,CH24.95 d (10.7)5.11, d (17.4) 5.09, d (17.4)16 12.0,CH31.72, s 12.1,CH31.71, s17 15.3,CH30.97c 15.6,CH31.01, d (6.1)18 194.5,CH9.40, s 190.1,CH9.30, s19 202.1,CH10.00, s 202.0,CH10.37, s20 25.7,CH30.98c 25.1,CH30.90, s1′ 170.0, C - 170.0, C -2′ 20.7,CH32.12, s 20.8,CH32.10, sOR-6 - 3.41, br s 57.1,CH33.32, saCDCl3; 500.13 MHz for1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C NMR; δ inppm. b13C NMR data extracted from HSQC and HMBC spectra.cOverlapping signals.Journal of Natural Products pubs.acs.org/jnp Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00840J. Nat. Prod. 2022, 85, 1201−12101203(Δε +26.19) and 234 (Δε −8.3) nm in the ECD spectrum(Figure S28, Supporting Information) confirmed the absoluteconfiguration as 2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,18R,19S. The structure of 9was thus established as (2R)-propanoyloxy-(6R)-methoxy-18R,19S-diacetoxyzuelanin, a new natural product.Compounds 1−9 were first tested at a single concentrationof 20 μM in the FLIPR assay (Figure 4). The results showedthat 3, 7, and 8 significantly enhanced the GABA signals.Diterpenoids 1 and 5 were found to have moderate activity (%activation ∼40%), while 2, 4, 6, and 9 displayed no discernibleactivity. Concentration−response and EC50 values were thusdetermined for compounds 3, 7, and 8. They displayedsignificant positive allosteric modulation of the GABA signals,with EC50 values of 0.5, 4.6, and 1.4 μM, respectively (Figure5). When compared to other known allosteric GABAA receptormodulators previously tested in the FLIPR assay, such aspiperine (EC50: 5.8 μM), magnolol (EC50: 4.8 μM), andvalerenic acid (EC50: 12.6 μM),14 diterpenoids 3, 7, and 8 weremore potent.GABAA receptors possess several binding sites.5,6 Thebinding sites of most classical orthosteric and allostericagonists and antagonists have been shown to be located inthe extracellular domain. In addition, the interfaces betweensubunits of GABAA receptors in the transmembrane domain(TMD) contain specific binding sites for ligands of differenttypes including lipids and neurosteroids, while direct channelblockers bind within the ion pore formed by the GABAAreceptor pentamer.22−25We investigated the possible binding site of diterpenoid 8utilizing known receptor agonists/antagonists for the differentallosteric binding sites. In a first step, the assay conditions forthe binding sites and agonist/antagonist combinations wereoptimized. The potentiation of the GABA signal by diazepam(2 μM) was abolished by flumazenil (0.001−100 μM) in aconcentration-dependent manner (Figure S29, SupportingInformation), and activation by the neurosteroid allopreg-nanolone (0.5 μM) was abrogated by increasing concen-trations of pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS, 0.001−100 μM,Figure S30, Supporting Information). The barbiturate-bindingsite was validated with the aid of the positive modulatoretazolate (Figure S31, Supporting Information), since noantagonists of this binding site are known. In contrast, noactivation was seen in the presence of ethanol at concen-trations up to 640 mM (Figure S32, Supporting Information).Figure 2.

Prod. 2022, 85, 1201−12101204This is in line with reports that GABAA receptors containing γ2subunits are only weakly sensitive to ethanol.23,24To assess a possible interaction with the benzodiazepinebinding site, compound 8 (5 μM) was tested together withincreasing concentrations of the antagonist flumazenil (0.001−10 μM) (Figure S33A, Supporting Information). Theactivation by 8 was not abrogated even at the highestflumazenil concentration. When combining increasing concen-trations of compound 8 (0.5−8 μM) with diazepam (2 μM) anadditive effect was observed (Figure S33B, SupportingInformation). These data indicated that the diterpenoid wasinteracting with a binding site that was independent of thebenzodiazepine site. The potentiation of the GABA signal byetazolate (2 μM) was further increased by increasingconcentrations of 8 (0.5−8 μM) (Figure S33, SupportingInformation), suggesting that the diterpenoid interacted withan allosteric site other than the barbiturate-binding site of theGABAA receptor. Given that no antagonists at this binding siteare currently known, no antagonist experiments wereconducted. Neurosteroids and general anesthetics are knownto bind on sites located in the TMD and subunit interface ofTable 2. 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopic Data for Compounds 6, 7, and 9a6 7 9position δCb, type δH (J in Hz) δC, type δH (J in Hz) δC, type δH (J in Hz)1α 27.0, CH2 1.93c 26.1, CH2 2.21c 30.3, CH2 1.95c1β 1.93c 1.82c 1.91c2 66.8, CH 5.51c 70.5, CH 5.60, dddd (9.5, 7.0, 2.8, 1.8) 66.1, CH 5.49, br t (4.3)3 121.5, CH 6.11, dd (4.0, 0.9) 125.2, CH 5.91, br s 121.2, CH 5.93, br d (3.7)4 146.3, C - 143.4, C - 146.0, C -5 53.6, C - 52.0, C - 52.9, C -6 72.9, CH 3.78, dd (12.1, 4.1) 74.8, CH 5.17, dd (12.2, 4.3) 81.9, CH 3.29c7 37.5, CH2 1.65c 33.4, CH2 1.64c 31.5, CH2 1.46, ddd (12.8, 12.8, 12.8)1.72, dd (3.7, 3.7) 1.81c 1.88c8 36.7, CH 1.78c 36.1, CH 1.94c 36.1, CH 1.73c9 37.9, C - 38.4, C - 37.7, C -10 37.1, CH 2.41, dd (10.1, 7.0) 42.2, CH 2.45, dd (14.0, 2.8) 37.0, CH 2.35, dd (13.1, 4.0)11 30.4, CH2 1.76c 29.9, CH2 1.72c 27.1, CH2 1.71c2.24, dd (16.8, 8.5) 2.25c 2.25, dd (16.6, 8.7)12 129.2, CH 5.40, br dd (7.9, 3.1) 128.5, CH 5.38, br dd (7.6, 2.1) 129.3, CH 5.42, dd (8.2, 2.4)13 135.5, C - 135.8, C - 135.3, C -14 141.3, CH 6.26, dd (17.4, 10.7) 141.1, CH 6.32, dd (17.2, 10.8) 141.3, CH 6.31, dd (17.2, 10.8)15 110.7, CH2 4.92 d (10.7) 111.0, CH2 4.95, d (10.7) 110.7, CH2 4.94, d (10.7)5.09, d (17.4) 5.11, d (17.4) 5.10, d (17.1)16 11.8, CH3 1.67c 11.8, CH3 1.68c 11.8, CH3 1.68, s17 15.5, CH3 0.94, d (6.7) 15.3, CH3 0.94, d (6.7) 15.7, CH3 0.97, d (7.0)18 104.6, CH 5.53c 94.8, CH 6.49, dd (1.5, 1.5) 96.2, CH 6.67, dd (1.5, 1.2)19 96.7, CH 6.49, s 97.0, CH 6.54, s 97.7, CH 6.50, s20 24.9, CH3 0.81, s 24.9, CH3 0.87, s 24.9, CH3 0.83, s1′ 166.7, C - 169.7, C - 173.8, C -2′ 136.7, C - 21.1, CH3 2.08c 27.9, CH2 2.42, qd (7.6, 1.2)3′ 125.2, CH2 5.58, dq (1.7, 1.4) 170.1, C - 9.1, CH3 1.21, dd (7.6, 7.6)6.12, dq (1.7, 0.9)4′ 18.0, CH3 1.98, dd (1.4, 0.9) 21.1, CH3 2.08c - -OR-6 - - 170.7, C - 57.4, CH3 3.31, sOR1″-18 55.6, CH3 3.41, s 21.1, CH3 2.08c 170.1, C -OR2″-18 - - 169.3, C - 21.2, CH3 2.10, sOR1″′-19 169.6, C - 21.1, CH3 1.96, s 169.5, C -OR2″′-19 21.4, CH3 1.92, s 26.1, CH2 2.21c 21.6, CH3 1.95, s1.82caCDCl3; 500.13 MHz for1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C NMR; δ in ppm. b13C NMR data extracted from HSQC and HMBC spectra. cOverlappingsignals.Figure 4.

Prod. 2022, 85, 1201−12101205the GABAA receptor.25−27 To assess a possible interaction withan antagonist neurosteroid binding site, diterpenoid 8 (10 μM)was tested in combination with the negative allostericmodulator pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) and the positiveallosteric modulator allopregnanolone (Figure S35, SupportingInformation). At lower concentrations, PREGS had no effect,and a decrease of the GABA signal was only seen at the highestconcentration of PREGS (10 μM). When 8 (0.5−4.0 μM) wastested together with the positive allosteric modulatorallopregnanolone (0.25 μM), the activation increased in aconcentration-dependent manner indicating additive effects of8 and allopregnanolone.Finally, the GABAergic activity of 8 was validated in voltageclamp studies on Xenopus laevis oocytes transiently expressingGABAA receptors of the α1β2γ2S and α1β2 subtypes,respectively. In the presence of GABA EC3−7, compound 8potentiated GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) withboth receptor subunit compositions (EC50 (α1β2γ2S) = 43.6 ±11.4 μM; Emax = 809 ± 86% (n = 3) and EC50 (α1β2) = 57.6 ±23.4 μM; Emax = 534 ± 88% (n = 3); Figure 6). IGABAstimulation by compound 8 (50 μM) was not dependent ona γ subunit and not prevented by flumazenil (2 μM), therebyindicating an interaction independent of the benzodiazepinebinding site.Cryoelectron microscopic structures of GABAA receptorshave been recently published28−30 and revealed the existenceof separate binding sites for agonistic and antagonisticneurosteroids on the α1 subunit and at the interface of theβ3/α1 subunits.25,31 The inhibition of the GABA signal at thehighest PREGS concentration (10 μM, Figure S35, SupportingInformation) is more likely to reflect a direct inhibition ofIGABA than interaction with a binding site for neurosteroids.32,33The additive effects of the positive allosteric modulatorallopregnanolone and 8 suggest an independent action ofthese ligands.Taken together, the lack of flumazenil action on thestimulation of α1β2γ2S receptors by 8, the additive effects ofsaturating concentrations of 8 with diazepam, the barbiturateetazolate, the agonistic neurosteroid allopregnanolone, and thelack of effects of PREGS at concentrations <10 μM suggest aseparate binding site for compound 8 on GABAA receptors.While the EC50 values in Xenopus oocytes expressing α1β2γ2Sand α1β2 receptors are relatively moderate in potency, themaximal potentiations (Emax) of 809 and 549%, respectively,are notable and significantly higher than that of drugs such asdiazepam (∼200% in the Xenopus oocyte assay).34 However,further investigations are needed to better understand if 8binds to a novel binding pocket or if its action is linked to oneof the other known putative binding sites of GABAA receptormodulators.5■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations weremeasured in chloroform on a P-2000 digital polarimeter (JASCO)equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and a 10 cm temperature-controlled microcell. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrawere recorded on a Chirascan CD spectrometer with 1 mm pathprecision cells (110 QS, Hellma Analytics), at a concentration of 0.1−0.2 mg/mL in acetonitrile (CH3CN). NMR spectra were measuredwith a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz for1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C. 1H NMR, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, andNOESY spectra were measured with a 1 mm TXI probe at 23 °C. 13CNMR spectra were obtained in 3 or 5 mm tubes with a BBO probe at23 °C.

Conformational analysis was per-formed with Schrödinger MacroModel 9.8 (Schrödinger, LLC, NewYork, USA) employing the OPLS2005 (optimized potential for liquidsimulations) force field in water for ECD calculations. The fiveconformers with the lowest energy were selected for geometricaloptimization and energy calculation by applying DFT with theBecke’s nonlocal three parameter exchange and correlation functionaland the Lee−Yang−Parr correlation functional level (CAM-B3LYP),using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set and the SCRF method with the CPMCmodel for solvation (MeOH) with the Gaussian 09 programpackage.35 Excitation energy (denoted by wavelength in nm), rotatorstrength (Rstr), dipole velocity (Rvel), and dipole length (Rlen) werecalculated in CH3CN by TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). ECDcurves were obtained on the basis of rotator strengths with a half-bandof 0.3 eV using SpecDis v1.71.36 ECD spectra were calculated fromthe spectra of individual conformers according to their contributioncalculated by Boltzmann weighting.FLIPR Assay. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stablyexpressing the GABAA receptor with the α1β2γ2 subunit compositionwere passaged following an established protocol.15,16 The Chinesehamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the α1β2γ2 GABAAreceptor subtype was cloned by B’SYS. Cells were cultured in aDMEM F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%penicillin/streptomycin, under antibiotic pressure with 200 μg/mL ofhygromycin B, 5 μg/mL of puromycin, and 100 μg/mL of zeocin.Cells were incubated in humidified air at 37 °C and 5% CO2, until80−90% cell confluency. The passage numbers used in this studywere from 10 to 30. Briefly, cells of ca. 80−90% confluency wereseeded in a 96-well black-walled plate at a density of 60 000 cells/wellin 100 μL of culture medium. The plate was incubated in humidifiedair at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to allow cells to adhere. Then, 100μL of FLIPR red dye solution (10.4 mL of assay buffer and one vial ofred FLIPR assay reagent) was added to each well. The plate wasfurther incubated for 30 min to allow the dye to penetrate into the cellmembrane (assay plate). During the incubation time, a compoundplate (clear 96-well plate) with controls, extracts, microfractions,compounds, and blanks was prepared (200 μL/well). Test solutionsof extracts, microfractions, and compounds were prepared in buffer(consisting of 10% HBSS and 2% HEPES in sterilized H2O) andDMSO.For the extract library screening, 2 μL of a 10 mg/mL DMSO stocksolution of the extracts was added to 198 μL of buffer and transferredinto the compound plate. The final test concentration for extracts was20 μg/mL, with a final DMSO concentration in the assay of 0.1%. Forextracts tested, active (>35% potentiation) serial dilutions wereprepared from the stock solution to obtain final test concentrations of0.16, 0.31, 0.63, 1.25, 2.50, 5.00, 10.00, and 20.00 μg/mL.For the testing of microfractions, 10 μL of DMSO was added toeach well of the 96-well deepwell plate, followed by 990 μL of HBSSbuffer. The plate was shaken for 10 min at 500 rpm on a MixMateplate shaker (Eppendorf). Next, 100 μL of each well was mixed inEppendorf tubes with 100 μL o HBSS buffer (1:1 dilution), and thesolutions were transferred into the compound plate. Aliquots of 50 μLwere transferred from the compound plate to the assay plate duringthe fluorescent measurement.To test the pure compounds, stock solutions of 20 mM in DMSOwere prepared. Compounds were assayed at a final concentrationrange of 0.16 to 20.00 μM (8× dilution series) or alternatively from0.01 to 20.00 μM (12× dilution series). Aliquots of 200 μL from eachdilution were transferred into wells of the compound plate and tested.A series of controls was included in each assay. GABA at 200 μMwas used to represent 100% activation of the receptor, while GABA at2 μM represented the minimum activation (EC10). The positivecontrol was diazepam at 20 μM in the presence of GABA at 2 μM,and buffer with 0.1% DMSO was used as a blank. GABA solutions (2and 200 μM) were prepared from a 100 mM stock solution. In orderto achieve a final test concentration of 20 μM diazepam in the assayplate, a 100 μM working solution was prepared from a stock solution(1 mg/mL in MeOH).All test solutions were placed in the appropriate position in thecompound plate (200 μL). Right after the final incubation period ofthe assay plate, the compound and assay plates were placed into aFlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices). The FlexStation parameters usedin this study were as previously published.14 Fluorescence wasrecorded for 500 s. For the first 25 s, the background fluorescence ofthe assay plate was measured (background signal). At 25 s, 50 μL ofthe test solutions (dilutions from compounds, extracts, microfractions,diazepam, and blanks) was transferred from the compound plate intothe assay plate. The fluorescence was then recorded until 295 s. At295 s, 25 μL of the GABA solutions (final concentration of 2 or 200μM) was transferred into each well of the assay plate, andfluorescence was recorded until 500 s. The change in fluorescenceintensity measured between 270 and 330 s was used for thecalculation of percentage activation.Investigation of Allosteric Binding Sites. For the benzodiaze-pine binding site, a serial dilution of flumazenil (0.001 to 100 μM, 100mM stock solution in DMSO) with diazepam at a fixed concentrationof 2 μM was prepared in the compound plate and tested in the FLIPRassay according to the above protocol, with the addition of 2 μMGABA at 295 s. Then, compound 8 at a concentration of 5 μM wastested with increasing concentrations of flumazenil (0.001 to 10 μM).For an additive potentiation, increasing concentrations of compound8 (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 μM, from a 16 mM stock solution inDMSO) were tested together with diazepam at a fixed concentrationof 2 μM.Titrations of etazolate (0.78 to 25 μM, prepared from a 25 mMstock solution) were used to evaluate the barbiturate-binding site. Foran additive potentiation, increasing concentrations of compound 8(0.5 to 8.0 μM) were tested together with a fixed concentration ofetazolate at 0.78 μM.For the neurosteroid binding site, a serial dilution of PREGS (0.001to 100.0 μM, prepared from a 100 mM stock solution) was testedtogether with allopregnanolone at a fixed concentration of 0.5 μM.Then, compound 8 at a fixed concentration of 10 μM was tested inthe presence of increasing concentrations of PREGS (0.001 to 10Journal of Natural Products pubs.acs.org/jnp Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00840J. Nat. Prod. 2022, 85, 1201−12101208μM). For an additive potentiation, increasing concentrations ofcompound 8 (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μM) were tested in the presence ofa fixed concentration of 0.25 μM allopregnanolone. For all bindingsite experiments, 2 μM GABA was added at 295 s. In addition,controls of 2 μM GABA, 200 μM GABA, and 0.2% DMSO were usedin each assay plate.Statistical Analysis. GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPadSoftware) was used for the calculations and graphical plots. Grubbsʼtest of the GraphPad outlier calculator was used (α = 0.05) todetermine data outliers. After removal of outliers, percentageactivation (%) was calculated by normalizing the readouts of thecontrols and test samples with that of 200 μM GABA. To computethe statistical significance, the average total activation of each testsample was compared to the EC10 (2 μM GABA) by one-way analysisof variance, followed by Dunnettʼs multiple comparison test. Thestatistical significance indicated with *, **, ***, and ****,respectively, represents p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001, and p ≤ 0.0001.Two-Microelectrode Voltage Clamp Assay with Xenopuslaevis Oocytes. Recombinant GABAA receptors (α1β2γ2s and α1β2)were expressed in X. laevis oocytes by cRNA injection, as previouslydescribed.37 Two-microelectrode voltage clamp measurements wereperformed between days 1 and 5 after injection of cRNA of therespective subunits, using a TURBO TEC 03X amplifier (npiElectronic) at a holding potential of −70 mV and pCLAMP 10data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). The bath solutioncontained 90 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and the electrode filling solution contained 2M KCl. Test solutions (100 μL) were applied to the oocytes at aspeed of 300 μL/sec by means of the ScreeningTool (npi electronic)automated fast perfusion system. GABA EC3−7 was determinedthrough a concentration−response experiment with GABA. A stocksolution of compound 8 (100 mM) in DMSO was diluted with a bathsolution containing GABA EC3−7 to obtain appropriate workingsolutions according to a validated protocol. Enhancement of the IGABAwas defined as (I(GABA+Comp)/IGABA) − 1, where I(GABA+Comp) is thecurrent response in the presence of a given compound, and IGABA isthe control of the GABA-induced chloride current. Emax reflects themaximal IGABA enhancement. Concentration−response curves weregenerated, and the data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysisusing Origin Software (OriginLab Corporation, USA) and are givenas the means ± SEM of at least three oocytes from ≥2 batches.Diazepam (Sigma) and flumazenil (Sigma-Aldrich) were used aspositive controls at 2 μM.■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT*sı Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge athttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00840.NMR spectra and tables, ECD spectra of compounds,testing of extract, control experiments for variousbinding sites in the transfected CHO cells, and testingwith different agonists/antagonists (PDF)■ AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding AuthorMatthias Hamburger − Pharmaceutical Biology, Departmentof Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, 4056 Basel,Switzerland; orcid.org/0000-0001-9331-273X;Phone: 41-76-4321355; Email: matthias.hamburger@unibas.chAuthorsNova Syafni − Pharmaceutical Biology, Department ofPharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, 4056 Basel,Switzerland; Faculty of Pharmacy and Sumatran BiotaLaboratory, Andalas University, Padang, West Sumatra25175, IndonesiaMaria Teresa Faleschini − Pharmaceutical Biology,Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel,4056 Basel, SwitzerlandAleksandra Garifulina − Division of Pharmacology andToxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences,University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, AustriaOmbeline Danton − Pharmaceutical Biology, Department ofPharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, 4056 Basel,SwitzerlandMahabir P.
