The effect of photoperiod on ent-kaurene biosynthesis was de- 
termined in the long-day (LD) plants spinach (Spinacia oleracea 1.) 
and Agrostemma githago L. Further metabolism of ent-kaurene was 
blocked by application of the growth retardant tetcyclacis, and 
ent-kaurene accumulation was measured by isotopic dilution using 
gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring (CC-SIM) (E. 
CroBelindemann, J.E. Craebe, D. Stockl, P. Hedden [1991] Plant 
Physiol 96: 1099-1104). In  spinach, the rate of ent-kaurene accu- 
mulation in shoots grown under LD conditions was 3 times higher 
than in  shoots grown under short-day (SD) conditions. ent-Kaurene 
also accumulated in fully expanded leaves, but at a lower rate than 
in shoots (15 and 55 pmol g-' dry weight h-', respectively). In 
Agrostemma, ent-kaurene accumulated at a rate 2.5 times higher 
in plants grown under LD conditions than in those grown under SD 
conditions. In spinach, enhanced ent-kaurene accumulation was 
detectable after 1 long day, and with exposure to additional long 
days, the rate of ent-kaurene accumulation increased further. 
Conversely, when plants were exposed to LD conditions and then 
returned to SD conditions, the rate of ent-kaurene accumulation 
decreased. Following tetcyclacis application, ent-kaurene accu- 
mulation was observed in all parts of spinach that were analyzed, 
but there were large quantitative differences between organs of 
different ages. As the leaves matured, enf-kaurene biosynthesis 
declined. Petioles accumulated more ent-kaurene than the corre- 
sponding leaf blades. It is concluded that stimulation of ent- 
kaurene biosynthesis by LD conditions leads to a higher rate of 
gibberellin biosynthesis, which i s  essential for stem elongation in  
rosette plants. 
There is considerable evidence that the rate of GA biosyn- 
thesis in LD rosette plants is higher under LD conditions, 
when stem elongation and flower formation take place, than 
during vegetative growth in the rosette stage under SD con- 
ditions. For example, the GA content increased severalfold 
after the transfer of Silene plants from SD to LD conditions

(Talon and Zeevaart, 1990), particularly in the subapical 
region (Talon et al., 1991a). Large increases in GA content 
preceding stem elongation have also been observed in Agros- 
temma githago (Jones and Zeevaart, 1980). In spinach, the 
photoperiod is known to regulate at least two steps in GA 
metabolism, namely, the conversion of GAS3 to GA44 and of 
GAI9 to GAZ0 (Gilmour et al., 1986; Zeevaart et al., 1990; 
Talon et al., 1991b). Furthermore, L3H]GAZo was metabolized 
more rapidly in spinach plants in LD than in SD conditions 
(Metzger and Zeevaart, 1982), and treatment with a growth 
retardant led to a more rapid decline of the GA content of 
spinach in LD than in SD conditions (Zeevaart, 1971, 1974). 
Enhanced GA biosynthesis at the later steps of the pathway 
implies more rapid tumover of precursors earlier in the 
pathway. Thus, it is to be expected that the conversion of 
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to ent-kaurene, the first com- 
mitted step in GA biosynthesis, is stimulated in plants grown 
under LD conditions. However, except for some systems 
prepared from immature seeds, cell-free extracts assayed for 
ent-kaurene biosynthesis have yielded low incorporation 
rates orno activity at a11 (West et al., 1982; Graebe, 1987). In 
the case of spinach, no ent-kaurene synthetase activity was 
detectable in cell-free extracts from leaves (R.J. Bensen and 
J.A.D. Zeevaart, unpublished data), although active prepa- 
rations for GA conversions late in the pathway can be ob- 
tained from such leaves (Gilmour et al., 1986). Consequently, 
it has not been possible until now to compare the rates of 
ent-kaurene biosynthesis in plants grown under SD and LD 
conditions. Recently, a nove1 method has been reported for 
measurement of in vivo ent-kaurene biosynthesis that is 
based on ent-kaurene accumulation following addition of 
growth retardants that block ent-kaurene oxidation 
(Gropelindemann et al., 1991). In this approach, it is assumed 
that, at least initially, ent-kaurene accumulates at its rate of 
biosynthesis. This method was used in the present study to 
measure ent-kaurene accumulation in two LDPs, spinach 
(Spinacia oleracea L.) and A. githago L., grown under SD and 
LD conditions. The distribution of ent-kaurene in spinach 
leaves of different ages was also determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Preparation of e~~t-['~C]Kaurene 
ent-[l4C]Kaurene (batches of 7.8 and 8.0 MBqlpmol) was 
prepared from R-2-['4C]mevalonic acid lactone (Amersham; 
1.99 MBq/pmol) using a cell-free system from Cucurbita 
maxima endosperm (Graebe et al., 1972; Turnbull et al., 1985). 
Prior to incubation, the enzyme preparation was centrifuged 
at 100,OOOg for 1 h to remove endogenous ent-kaurene bound 
to membrane fragments. The supernatant was filtered 
through a 0.2-pm Uniflo filter (unit #02330, Schleicher & 
Schuell). Tetcyclacis (final concentration 200 p ~ )  was added 
to the incubation mixture to block oxidation of ent-kaurene. 
After incubation for 2 h, the preparation was partitioned four 
times with equal volumes of hexanes (boiling range 68.3- 
68.9OC) and two times with EtOAc. The combined organic 
fractions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent 
was evaporated. The residue was taken up in 1 mL of hexanes 
and applied to a 3-mL Silica gel column, which was eluted 
with 12 mL of hexanes. As analyzed by HPLC, the eluate 
contained a single radioactive compound that was identified 
as ent-[14C]kaurene by GC-MS. 
Plant Crowth Retardant 
Tetcyclacis [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4,5,9,lO-pentaaza-tetra- 
cyclo-5,4,102~6,08~11-dodeca-3,9-diene] was a gift from Dr. W. 
Rademacher, BASF, Limburgerhof, FRG. A concentrated so- 
lution of tetcyclacis in acetone was added to stirring water to 
give a concentration of 20 p ~ .  
Plant Material 
Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv Savoy Hybrid 612; Harris 
Seed Co., Rochester, NY) was grown in 530-mL plastic con- 
tainers filled with a gravel-vermiculite (1:2) mixture, and 
Agrostemma githago L. was grown in 340-mL plastic con- 
tainers filled with a mixture of peat moss and sand (4:l). The 
plants were watered daily with half-strength Hoagland nu- 
trient solution. The plants were grown under SD conditions 
consisting of 8 h of light from fluorescent and incandescent 
lamps (450 pmol m-' s-') at 23OC and 16 h of darkness at 
2OoC until ready for experimentation, which was approxi- 
mately 7 weeks after sowing. For LD conditions, the 8-h 
main light period was followed by 16 h of light from incan- 
descent lamps (12 pmol m-'s-') at 2OOC. 
Applications of tetcyclacis (30 mL of a 20 p~ solution per 
container for spinach and 20 mL for Agrostemma) were made 
at the beginning and end of the 8-h main light period. Plants 
were harvested at different times after the first growth retar- 
dant application. Spinach shoots were cut below the shoot 
apex, and older leaves up to the just fully expanded leaf were 
removed. Mature leaves in Figure 1 included the next three 
leaves of each plant. The material was frozen in liquid N2 
and lyophilized. Each sample included two shoots with a 
combined dry weight of 1.5 to 2.0 g. 
An experiment on the distribution of ent-kaurene in spin- 
ach plants was conducted. From each plant, the following 
parts were harvested, starting from the outside of the rosette: 
(a) two oldest leaves that did not show symptoms of senes- 
cence; (b) next two oldest leaves; (c) two or three just mature 
leaves; (d) five or six leaves 2 10 cm that were not yet fully 
expanded; (e) six or seven young leaves, 1.5 to 10.0 cm long; 
(f) shoot tip consisting of leaf primordia up to 1.5 cm long 
and 0.2 to 0.3 cm of the upper part of the root. The leaves in 
categories a to d were separated into blades and petioles. 
Agrostemma plants had severa1 axillary shoots. The main 
shoot and four axillary shoots of each plant were harvested 
and combined. Each shoot included the four youngest leaf 
pairs. The material was frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized. 
Extraction and Purification of ent-Kaurene 
The lyophilized samples were homogenized in cold EtOAc 
with a Polytron (Brinkmann), and the extract was filtered 
through a Büchner funnel. The tissue residue was resus- 
pended in EtOAc, kept overnight at 4OC, and filtered again. 
ent-[l4C]Kaurene (ranging from 1-10 kBq, depending on the 
expected endogenous ent-kaurene content of the sample) was 
added as interna1 standard to the combined filtrates. The 
EtOAc was evaporated to a small volume on a rotary evap- 
orator (Brinkmann), and 8 mL of water was added. The two 
solvents were mixed with a Mini-Shaker (Fisher) and then 
separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The EtOAc 
phase was removed with a Pasteur pipet. Extraction of the 
aqueous phase with EtOAc was repeated twice. The com- 
bined EtOAc fractions were evaporated on a rotary evapo- 
rator to a small volume and dried under a stream of NZ. The 
residue was dissolved in 5 mL of hexanes. The green solution 
was applied to a Silica gel (EM Science; Silica gel 60, particle 
size 0.063-0.200 mm) column (20 mL) and eluted with 40 
mL of hexanes. The colorless eluate was evaporated to a 
small volume and dried under a stream of N2. The residue 
was dissolved in 1.2 mL of MeOH by sonication, after which 
0.3 mL of distilled water was added. This 80% MeOH solu- 
tion was injected via a Rheodyne injector with a 2-mL loop 
onto a NOVA-PAK Cls column (15 X 0.39 'cm, Waters), 
which was attached to a CI8 Guard-PAK precolumn. A 7- 
min linear gradient of 80 to 100% MeOH was run at a flow 
rate of 1.0 mL min-'. The effluent was passed through a 
radioactive flow detector (Flo-One model, RadioAnalytic, 
Inc.) using a 250-pL solid scintillator flow cell. The radioactive 
peak with a retention time around 16.5 min was collected. 
Because ent-kaurene is volatile at room temperature (Graebe, 
1987; Gropelindemann, 1991), the sample was held at O°C 
while the MeOH was evaporated in a stream of NZ. 
CC-SIM 
The samples were analyzed with a JEOL JMS-AX 505H 
mass spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 5890A 
gas chromatograph. The samples were dissolved in a small 
volume of hexanes and 1 to 2 pL were injected into a J&W 
30 m X 0.32 mm (i.d.) DB-1 capillary column coated with 
methyl silicone, at a thickness of 0.25 pm, in splitless mode, 
at an oven temperature of 5OOC. The temperature of the oven 
was programmed from 50 to 23OOC at 4OoC min-' and from 
230 to 265OC at 8OC min-I. Helium was used as the carrier 
gas and was maintained at a head pressure of 70 kPa. The 
flow rate through the column was approximately 1 mL

via a heated interface. The ion source temperature was 
28OoC, the electron ionization energy was 70 eV, and the 
emission current was 0.25 mA. The injector and interface 
temperatures were 260 and 28OoC, respectively. For GC-SIM, 
the five ions in the molecular ion cluster of ent-[14C]kaurene, 
m/z 272, 274, 276, 278, and 280, were monitored with dwell 
times of 100 ms. The specific activity of each sample was 
determined from the relative abundances of these five ions 
(Bowen et al., 1972; Gropelindemann et al., 1991). The 
method for calculating specific activities used a Pascal pro- 
gram provided by Mr. S.W. Zeevaart. The amount of endog- 
enous ent-kaurene in a sample was calculated with the for- 
mula (Rittenberg and Foster, 1940):

RESULTS 
ent-Kaurene Accumulation in Spinach 
When spinach shoots were analyzed by the isotopic dilu- 
tion method, plants under SD and LD conditions contained 
5 and 12 pmol g-’ dry weight of ent-kaurene, respectively. 
No ent-kaurene could be detected in fully expanded leaves. 
Following treatment with tetcyclacis, ent-kaurene accumu-

lated at a linear rate for at least 32 h in both the shoots and 
mature leaves and continued to increase in the shoots up to 
at least 80 h, whereas in the mature leaves, the ent-kaurene 
content leveled off after 56 h (Fig. 1). The rate of accumula- 
tion in the shoots was 3 times higher in plants in LD conditons 
than in those kept in SD conditions. Although smaller in 
magnitude, mature leaves under LD conditions also accu- 
mulated more ent-kaurene than those in SD. 
When spinach plants were treated with tetcyclacis from 
the onset of LD treatment, petiole and stem elongation were 
inhibited and the plants continued to exhibit a SD growth 
habit (Zeevaart, 1971). Petioles that were approximately 0.5 
cm long when the plants were transferred to LD conditions 
had elongated to 6.4 f 0.3 cm (average f SE) after 7 long 
days, whereas in comparable plants treated with tetcyclacis, 
the petioles were 1.0 f 0.1 cm long. As shown by the results 
in Table I, the capacity for an increased rate of ent-kaurene 
accumulation developed gradually as plants were exposed to 
increasing numbers of long days. However, in a11 experiments 
conducted, increased ent-kaurene accumulation was ob- 
served after 1 LD. 
Petiole and stem elongation cease when spinach plants are 
returned from LD to SD conditions (Zeevaart, 1971). It was 
of interest, therefore, to determine whether this cessation of 
growth is correlated with a decreased rate of ent-kaurene 
biosynthesis. The results of both experiments in Table I1 
establish that after 3 short days, the rate of ent-kaurene

biosynthesis had been reduced to less than 40% of that in 
plants that had been kept in LD conditions. 
The effect of leaf age on ent-kaurene biosynthesis was 
investigated in the experiment presented in Table 111. The 
leaves were separated into blades and petioles. Two trends 
can be observed in these results. First, the rate of ent-kaurene 
biosynthesis decreased with increasing age of the leaves, 
although some ent-kaurene accumulation occurred even in 
the oldest nonsenescent leaves. Shoot tips appeared to be the 
only exception to this trend. However, because this part also 
included the upper section of the thick root, which provided 
the bulk of the weight, the amount of ent-kaurene per unit 
dry weight of the shoot tip was grossly underestimated. 
Second, petioles accumulated much more ent-kaurene per 
unit dry weight than did the leaf blades. Although the 
combined dry weight of a11 the petioles per plant was less 
than that of the blades, when expressed on a per plant basis, 
considerably more ent-kaurene accumulated in the petioles 
than in the blades (Table 111). 
ent-Kaurene Accumulation in Agrostemma 
The time course of ent-kaurene accumulation in Agros- 
temma shoots treated with tetcyclacis under SD and LD 
conditions (Fig. 2) showed the same trend as in spinach. 
However, the rate of ent-kaurene accumulation was consid- 
erably lower than in spinach. Whereas in spinach shoots in 
LD conditions, ent-kaurene accumulated initially at a rate of 
55 pmol g-’ dry weight h-’ (Fig. l), in Agrostemma in LD 
conditions, this rate was only 10 pmol g-] dry weight h-’ 
(Fig. 2). 
DlSCUSSlON 
In the present experiments, 14C was used as a radioisotopic 
label to detect ent-[14C]kaurene in the HPLC column effluent 
and as a heavy isotope to determine the specific activ- 
ity of ent-[’4C]kaurene by GC-SIM. The results demon- 
strate that this method, first employed for measuring accu- 
mulation of ent-kaurene in germinating barley caryopses 
(Gropelindemann et al., 1991), is also useful for quantitation 
of ent-kaurene in heavily pigmented tissues. 
The increased rate of ent-kaurene biosynthesis in LD con- 
ditions is a photoperiodic effect, because both SD and LD 
treatments consisted of the same main light period, which, 
in the case of LD conditions, was supplemented with low- 
intensity irradiation from 40-W incandescent bulbs. Evidence 
for increased GA biosynthesis in rosette plants in LD condi- 
tions has been obtained previously (e.g. Talon and Zeevaart, 
1990; Talon et al., 1991a, 1991b). The present results provide 
experimental evidence in support of the idea (West et al., 
1982; Graebe, 1987) that ent-kaurene biosynthesis is a point 
of regulation for the entire GA biosynthetic pathway. How- 
ever, it should be remembered that ent-kaurene biosynthesis 
is not equivalent to GA biosynthesis. Intermediates can be 
lost to GA biosynthesis via the kaurenolide and ent-ba,7a- 
dihydroxykaurenoic acid branches (Graebe, 1987). Further- 
more, C2,-GAs with C-20 at the carboxyl stage are not 
converted to C19-GAs. 
Tetcyclacis is transported in the xylem (Rademacher et al., 
1984). Clearly, uptake via the roots and distribution to the 
sites of action must be rapid, because 8 h after its application, 
considerable accumulation of ent-kaurene was already ob- 
served (Figs. 1 and 2). Movement of tetcyclacis in the xylem 
implies that it is predominantly accumulated in the mature 
leaves that have the highest rate of transpiration. However, 
the data in Table 111 show that the youngest leaves had the 
highest rates of ent-kaurene accumulation. In this context. a

ent-Kaurene Biosynthesis in Long-Day Plants 29  
high rate of ent-kaurene accumulation requires a high rate of 
ent-kaurene biosynthesis as well as a sufficiently high tetcy- 
clacis concentration to block oxidation of the synthesized ent- 
kaurene. In addition to being transported in the xylem, tet- 
cyclacis is perhaps also translocated in the phloem with the 
photosynthates from mature leaves to immature tissues to 
give the concentration necessary to block ent-kaurene oxi- 
dation in  these tissues. 
It is assumed that the high rate of ent-kaurene accumula- 
tion in  petioles represents in situ biosynthesis, because it is 
improbable that this hydrophobic intermediate is transported 
from another site of synthesis. In cell-free extracts from pea 
seedlings, relatively high ent-kaurene synthesizing activity 
(product not identified by GC-MS) was found in petioles of 
pea seedlings (Chung and  Coolbaugh, 1986). The high rates 
of ent-kaurene synthesis in  petioles suggest that these organs 
may be an important site of GA biosynthesis. This is not 
unexpected, because petioles of spinach show a rapid and  
large growth response in  LD conditions prior to the onset of 
stem growth (Zeevaart, 1971). In the present experiments, 
this growth response was inhibited by tetcyclacis. 
In previous work with Agrostemma, it was shown that 
application of tetcyclacis suppresses stem growth and  inhibits 
GA production (Zeevaart, 1985). The present results extend 
these findings by showing that ent-kaurene is produced at  a 
high rate in  plants under LD conditions and  is continuously 
converted to GAs that are essential for stem growth in  rosette 
plants. Thus, it appears that in  LDP, the flux through 
the entire GA biosynthetic pathway is enhanced by LD 
conditions.
