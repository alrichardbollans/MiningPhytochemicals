IntroductionAptenia cordifolia, belonging to the Aizoaceae family, is aperennial herb native to South Africa and has now largelyspread throughout Europe. The most commonly grownplant, usually grown under the cultivar name of ‘RedApple’, is considered by some botanists to be actually ahybrid between Aptenia cordifolia and the closely relatedPlatythyra Aptenia haeckeliana.1 Previous chemical studiesof the aerial part of A. cordifolia evidenced the presence offlavonoids.2 As part of our research on bioactive naturalproducts isolated from spontaneous plants present in Italyand their use as natural herbicide models, we recentlyreported that some metabolites isolated from Brassicafruticulosa and Chenopodium album inhibited the germina-tion and growth of some mono and dicotyledons.3,40040–4020/$ - see front matter q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The HMBC spectrum showed cross-peaks of both the H-2 and H-5 protons with the C-3 and C-4carbons and the H-6 with the C-1 and C-7. Furthermore theH-2 0/H-6 0 protons gave cross peaks with the C-4 0 and C-7 0carbons, the H-7 0 and the H-8 0 protons gave cross peaks withthe C-1 0 and C-9 0 carbons. These data led to the structure 2as depicted. The assignment of the methoxyl at C-3 wasconfirmed by NOE between the methoxyl and the H-2proton.Apteniol C (3) had the molecular formula C21H24O6 asdeduced from the molecular peak at m/z 372 in the MALDI-MS spectrum. The general features of its IR and NMRspectra (Tables 1 and 2) closely resembled those of 2, exceptfor the presence of two methoxyl signals in the NMRFigure 1.

The HMBC spectrum of compound 4 showedcross-peaks of both the H-2 and H-6 with C-4 and C-7, andboth the H-2 0 and the H-5 0 protons with the C-1 0 and C-4 0carbons. NOEs between the signal at d 3.87 and the H-2, H-6and H-2 0 protons allowed to assign the methoxyls at C-3,C-5, and C-5 0 positions.Apteniol E (5) showed a molecular peak at m/z 480 [MC2Na]C in the MALDI-MS spectrum suggesting, along withthe elemental analysis, a molecular formula C22H26O9. TheUV spectrum revealed bands at 322, 279 and 244 nm. The1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed only one singletaromatic signal, two triplets in aliphatic region, and amethyl signals. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) onlyeight carbon signals were present indicating a highlysymmetric molecule. The 1H and 13C resonances of 5were assigned by combination of COSY, DEPT, HMQC andHMBC experiments. The DEPT spectrum showed onemethyl, two methylenes, and one methine. According to thestructure in the HMBC spectrum both the H-7/H-7 0 and theH-8/H-8 0 protons were correlated to the C-9/C-9 0 at d 178.4and the C-1/C-1 0 at d 132.0; furthermore the H-2, H-6/H-2 0,H-6 0 protons were correlated to the C-1/C-1 0 and C-4/C-4 0carbons. The NOE of the signal at d 3.88 with H-2/H-6 andH-2 0/H-6 0 allowed assignment of the methoxyls at the C-3,C-3 0, C-5, and C-5 0 positions.Apteniol F (6) had the same molecular formula as 2 asdeduced from a molecular peak at m/z 343 [MKH]C in theMALDI-MS spectrum, and the elemental analysis. The 1HNMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of onearomatic ring with three coupled protons in a ABX system,an aromatic ring with four adjacent protons, two methylenesas triplets and a methyl singlet of a methoxyl group. In the13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) sixteen carbon signals werepresent, and the DEPT experiment showed one methyl, fourmethylenes, and five methines. The 1H and 13C resonancesof apteniol F were assigned by a combination of COSY,DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The HMBCspectrum of compound 6 showed cross-peaks of H-7 withC-2, C-6 and C-9, H-8 with C-1, and both the H-2 0 and theH-5 0 protons with the C-1 0 and C-4 0 carbons. NOEs betweenthe signal at d 3.87 and H-2 0 allowed assignment of themethoxyl at the C-3 0 position.All of the compounds isolated from A. cordifolia were testedfor their phytotoxicity on the seeds of Lactuca sativa.5 Thisspecies was selected as representative of main dicotyledoncommercial crops.5 It has been used extensively as a testorganism because of its fast germination and highsensitivity, and allows comparison of bioassay results formany different compounds.6,7 Aqueous solution of oxy-neolignans 1–6, ranging between 10K4 and 10K7 M, weretested on germination, root length and shoot length oftreated lettuce seeds (Fig. 1). All the tested compoundsreduced the germination by 25% at 10K4 M, and dosedependence effects were observed. They reduced the rootelongation by 20% at 10K4 M, but compound 1 was themost active (40%) when compared to the control andcompound 3 was almost completely inactive. Amongstcompounds 1–6, only oxyneolignan 4 reduced shootelongation by 15% at the highest concentration and noimportant effects were observed for compounds 1, 3, and 6,while compounds 2 and 5 showed stimulatory effects within20–50%.Lignans, found widely throughout the plant kingdom,exhibit interesting antimicrobic, antiviral, herbicidal, orantifeedant activities that are thought to participate in plantdefence mechanisms against biotic stresses.8–11 Cancerprotective effects of dietary lignans have been alsodemonstrated.12,13 In contrast, neolignans are distributedin the limited plant families, as Pinaceae and Cupressa-ceae.14,15 The presence of dihydrocinnamic acid residues, inoxyneolignans isolated from A. cordifolia is peculiarbecause, to the best of our knowledge, the more commoncompounds isolated contain a reduced carboxylic group asalcohol or alkane.3. Experimental3.1. General proceduresNMR spectra were recorded at 25 8C on a Varian UNITYINOVA-500 spectrometer, operating at 500 and 125 MHzfor 1H and 13C, respectively.

Cavolo di Napoli, collectedduring 2003, were obtained from Ingegnoli Spa (Milan,Italy). All undersized or damaged seeds were discarded andthe assay seeds were selected for uniformity. For thebioassays we used Petri dishes of 50 mm diameter with onesheet of Whatman No. 1 filter paper as support. In fourreplicate experiments, germination and growth wereconducted in aqueous solutions at controlled pH. Testsolutions (10K4 M) were prepared using MES (2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mM, pH 6) and therest (10K5–10K7 M) were obtained by dilution. Parallelcontrols were performed. After adding 25 seeds and 2.5 mltest solutions, Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilmw toensure closed-system models. Seeds were placed in agrowth chamber KBW Binder 240 at 25 8C in the dark.Germination percentage was determined daily for 5 days (nomore germination occurred after this time). After growth,plants were frozen at K20 8C to avoid subsequent growthuntil the measurement process. Data are reported aspercentage differences from control in the graphics andtables. Thus, zero represents the control, positive valuesrepresent stimulation of the parameter studied and negativevalues represent inhibition.AcknowledgementsNMR experiments have been performed at Centro Inter-dipartimentale di Metodologie Chimico-Fisiche ofUniversity Federico II of Naples on a 500 MHzspectrometer of Consortium INCA.References and notes1.
