chewing sticks for cleaning and strengthening teeth, for reducing
blood ﬂow, and as an astringent against diarrhea and mouth
ulcers.

comparable to those of indomethacin (ID50 0.29 μmol/cm

ﬁrst step a potential topical anti-inﬂammatory eﬀect in vivo was
assessed using a croton oil-induced mouse ear dermatitis model.
Since the inﬂammatory response is a complex process, inﬂuenced
by a number of diﬀerent mediators, various molecular targets were
evaluated to gain insight into the mode of action of the isolated
secondary metabolites. Their eﬀects were investigated on classical
anti-inﬂammatory targets such as the glucocorticoid receptor

In Vivo Antiedema Activities. The topical anti-inflammatory
effect of the CH2Cl2 extract of K. lappacea roots as well as of the
isolated lignan derivatives was determined as antiedema activity
6 h (the maximum of edema formation in control mice) after
induction of dermatitis.
17 The extract exhibited a potent dose-
dependent inhibition of edema, which ranged from 24% at the
lowest dose (30 μg/cm
2) to 86% for the highest administration
(300 μg/cm
2). All isolated lignan derivatives significantly re-
duced the edematous responsefrom about 15% (0.1 μmol/cm
2)
toabout80%(1.0μmol/cm
2),inadose-dependentmanner.The
samedosesofthenonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrug(NSAID)
indomethacin reduced the induced edema formation between
25% and 80%, while the glucocorticoid hydrocortisone showed
edema inhibition from 29% to 77%, at 10 times lower doses
(Table 1). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory potency of the
extract as well as of the isolated compounds, ID50 values were
assessed.TheID50valueoftheextractwasdeterminedas77μg/cm

The lignan derivatives showed ID50 values in the range

were comparable to indomethacin (ID50 0.29 μmol/cm

The anti-inﬂammatory activities of the most promising com-
pounds, 5 and 7, at 0.4 μmol/cm
2, a dose leading to about 50%
edema reduction at 6 h, were investigated further with regard to
both edema development and leukocyte inﬁltration up to 48 h
after dermatitis induction and were compared to indomethacin
(0.4 μmol/cm
2) and hydrocortisone (0.04 μmol/cm
2).
Edematous Response. The time-dependent effect of the test
compounds on edema formation is represented in Figure 1.
Control animals developed an edematous response still measur-
able after 48 h, with a maximum 6 h after croton oil application,
followed by a progressive decrease. Compounds 5 and 7 exerted
a significant inhibitory activity at each observation time, showing
reductions in the ranges of 28 89% and 25 61%, respectively.
Interestingly, despite the similar activity profile, compound 5
provoked maximum edema reduction after 3 h (89%), which
declined to 29% reduction at 48 h. In contrast, (+)-conocarpan
(7) exhibited a long-lasting steady anti-inflammatory effect, with
a maximum response after 6 h (61%) and a still-pronounced
activity at 48 h with edema reduction by 41%. The effect of an
equimolar dose of indomethacin was significant only 3 and 6 h
after the induction of dermatitis, when it reduced the edematous
response by 84% and 76%, respectively. Indomethacin then lost
its antiedematous effect substantially, as previously observed.
17
Hydrocortisone (0.04 μmol/cm
2) reduced edema formation at
all observation times significantly, from 79% (6 h) to60% (12 h)
(Figure 1).
The activity proﬁle of the two benzofuran derivatives 5 and 7
and of the reference drugs on the whole edematous response up
to48hwasquantiﬁedbycalculatingtheratiobetweentheAUCs
for mice treated with these compounds and the AUCs of control
animals. Compounds 5 and 7 reduced the global edematous
response by the same extent (47%, and 45%, respectively),
exerting an eﬀect 2-fold more potent than that of indomethacin
(24% reduction) but signiﬁcantly lower compared to hydrocor-
tisone (69% reduction) (see Table S1, Supporting Information).
Cellular Infiltration. The effect of the test compounds on
leukocyte infiltration up to 48 h is represented in Figure 2. The
recruitment of leukocytes in the inflamed ear tissue of control
animals, measured as myeloperoxidase activity, was already
detectable 3 h after induction of dermatitis. It increased up to
24 h and slightly decreased until 48 h. Compounds 5 and 7
caused a significant reduction of leukocyte infiltration at all
observation times, ranging from 24% to 35% and 27% to 44%
inhibition, respectively. Indomethacin and hydrocortisone ex-
erted comparable effects (27 49% and 35 56% reductions,
respectively), which were significant at each observation time
(Figure 2).
The eﬀects of the benzofurans on the global granulocyte
inﬁltrate calculated from the AUCs represented in Figure 2
(32% and 37% reduction) were comparable to those of the
reference drugs indomethacin (42% reduction) and hydrocorti-
sone (51% reduction) (see Table S1, Supporting Information).
Histological Analysis. The anti-inflammatory effects of com-
pounds 5 and 7 and of the reference compounds were evaluated
additionally by the histological examination of ear tissues. Ear
dermaltissueofthecontrolmiceshoweddegranulatedmastcells
visible as soon as 3 h after dermatitis induction (see Figure S1B,
Supporting Information). Dilated blood vessels and dermal
swelling were also observable, becoming more evident after 6 h
(Figure3B)andprogressivelyattenuatingafter9h.Moreover,an
increased number of infiltrated neutrophilic granulocytes was
visible after 6 h, then increasing up to 24 h (see Figure S2B,
Supporting Information) and being still sustained after 48 h. Ears

due to inflammation, including the presence of mast cells
preserved from degranulation (Figures 3C, S1C, S2C; 3D,
S1D, S2D, Supporting Information). Similarly, ear tissues from
mice treated with indomethacin (0.4 μmol/cm
2) showed re-
duced mast cell degranulation and leukocyte infiltration at all
observation times. However, after 9 h the dermal swelling was
comparable to that of control mice (Figure 3E, Figures S1E, and
S2E,SupportingInformation).Earbiopsiesfromanimalstreated

Inhibition of NF-jB Activity. To obtain insight into the
molecular mechanism(s) of the observed in vivo effects, the K.
lappacea root CH2Cl2 extract was tested initially for its potential
to inhibit NF-kB transactivation activity in TNF-R-stimulated

HEK-293 cells stably transfected with a NF-kB-driven luciferase
reporter gene. Since this crude extract showed a pronounced
activity (>50% inhibition) at a concentration of 10 μg/mL, IC50
values for all isolated lignan derivatives (1 11) were deter-
mined. Interestingly, all compounds significantly reduced NF-k
B-dependent luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent
manner. Four compounds (5, 6, 8, and 11) were able to inhibit
NF-kB activation in the low micromolar range, comparably to
thepositivecontrol,parthenolide(IC501.4μM),withIC50values
ranging from 1.4 to 6.4 μM. Another four isolates (1, 2, 4, 10)
showed IC50 values between 11.6 and 14.7 μM. Only three
compounds (3, 7, 9) exhibited low NF-kB inhibition with IC50
values higher than 20 μM (Table 2). Although the compounds
tested show different substitution patterns, no clear structure
 activity relationship conclusions could be deduced. Since
luciferase reporter gene expression reflects a downstream event
of the NF-kB signaling cascade that did not permit conclusions
to be made regarding direct targets of the respective test
compounds, all compounds were tested also for their potential
toinhibitIKK2(inhibitorofNF-kBkinasesubunitbeta)activity,
as previously described.
18 However, none of the compounds
inhibited IKK2 at a concentration of 10 μM (data not shown),
thereby excluding this kinase as a direct target of the lignans. For
comparison, the reference compound used as a positive control
in the IKK2 test, IKK2 inhibitor IV, is known to have an IC50 in
the low nM range and in our hands completely suppressed IKK2
enzymatic activity to the background level when applied at a
concentration of 400 nM. Since GR as well as PPARR and -γ are
known to have NF-kB-antagonist action, the potential of all
lignan derivatives to activate these receptors using luciferase
reporter gene assays specific for PPARR, PPARγ, and GR was
assessed.
19,20 Given that none of the compounds tested showed
activities in any of the three assays (data not shown) at 10 μM,
effects at these three nuclear receptors can be excluded. For
comparison, the reference compound used for GR activation, dex-
amethasone, induced around a 10-fold signal induction at 2.5 μM.
Troglitazone used as a reference PPARγ activator induced a
6-foldactivationwithanEC50of0.4μM,andthepositivecontrol
for PPARR activation, GW7647, induced a 2.8-fold activation,
with an EC50 of 0.6 nM.
Free-Radical-Scavenging Activity. Reactive oxygen species
are known to be involved in the activation of NF-kB. To check
the potential radical-scavenging activity of the lignan derivatives,
a DPPH assay was performed. The K. lappacea root extract
significantlyinhibitedfree-radicalformationwithanIC50valueof
42.4 ( 6.3 μg/mL. Compounds 2 4, 7, 8, and 11 had no effect
in this assay up to 100 μM. Five compounds (1, 5, 6, 9, and 10)
showed free-radical scavenging activity in a concentration-
dependent manner with IC50 values ranging from 22 to 42 μM.

Targets of the Arachidonic Acid Cascade. To clarify the
impact of the K. lappacea lignans on further targets, the isolated
constituentswereinvestigatedfortheirpotentialtointerferewith
another crucial pathway in the inflammatory response, namely,
the arachidonic acid cascade, which is responsible for the
formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
Important enzymes are COX-1 and -2 and mPGES-1, catalyzing
the formation of PGG2 and PGE2, and 5-LO, which is respon-
sible for the production of leukotrienes via the intermediate
molecule 5-HPETE.
Inhibition of PGE2 Formation via COX-1 and COX-2. Initial
screening experiments of the CH2Cl2-soluble K. lappacea root
extract (50 μg/mL) revealed inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2,
withinhibitionratesof82.5 (8.9% and83.9(5.8%.Four(6,8,
9, 11) of the 11 isolated lignan constituents (50 μM) inhibited
these enzymes to an extent of 57.2% and 83.3% (data not
shown). IC50 value determination of the most potent substances
revealed that compounds 6, 9, and 11 had no isoform-specificity
since they showed almost identical IC50 values, 2.7 3.8 μM for
COX-1and1.7 7.6μMforCOX-2,comparabletothereference
drugs indomethacin (IC50 value COX-1, 2.1 μM) and NS-398
(IC50 value COX-2, 2.1 μM). In contrast, compound 8 inhibited
preferentially COX-2 (IC50 value COX-2, 2.0 μM; IC50 value
COX-1, 18.3 μM) (Table 2). Accordingly, the 5-(E)-propenyl-
benzofuran moiety with an unsaturated furan ring and a para-
hydroxy group seems to be essential for this activity.
Inhibition of5-LO-MediatedLTB4 Formation.Investigation
of the plant CH2Cl2 extract (50 μg/mL) and the 11 pure

active constituents. (+)-Conocarpan (7) showed the strongest
activity,withanIC50valueof18.4μM,followedbycompounds5
(IC5027.2μM)and1(IC5041.4μM).Comparedtothepositive
control zileuton (IC50 6.3 μM), only compound 7 showed a
relevant activity in the ex vivo in vitro setup (Table 2).
Inhibition of mPGES-1. In addition to the previous experi-
ments, the isolated lignan derivatives were assessed for their ability
to interfere with mPGES-1 in a cell-free assay. Therefore, an initial
screening experiment with all pure compounds at a concentration
of 10 μM was performed, resulting in the identification of com-
pounds6and8aspotentinhibitorsofmPGES-1.Bothcompounds
blocked PGE2 formation in a concentration-dependent manner,
with IC50 values of 7.4 and 5.3 μM, respectively (Table 2). As a
reference, the IC50 value of compound MK-886 was 2.1 μM
(Table 2). Compounds 4, 5, 7,a n d9 11 showed moderate
inhibitions, with IC50 values ranging from 11.0 to 42.0 μM. The
7,70-epoxy lignans (2, 3) as well as compound 1 were regarded as
inactive in this model (IC50 values >50 μM).
Taken together it has been shown that several of the lignan
derivatives investigated possess a pronounced topical anti-
inﬂammatory activity in vivo, comparable to that of indometha-
cin, and about 7 times less compared to hydrocortisone. An
attempt to clarify the mode of action of the pure compounds
revealed two relevant pathways, namely, the NF-kB-pathway,
where almost all investigated compounds showed activity, and
selected enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade, which were
inﬂuenced by only some of the benzofuran derivatives. Since the
in vivo and in vitro eﬀects determined, especially for the most
in vivo active compounds, 5 and 7, did not always correspond, it
can be concluded that additional inﬂammatory mediators might
contribute to the anti-inﬂammatory activities observed. The
elucidation of the responsible target(s) within the NF-kB path-
way as well as the possible impact on other inﬂammatory
cascades is part of an ongoing study. The present ﬁndings
support the medicinal use of the roots of K. lappacea in the
treatment of oropharyngeal inﬂammation as well as the con-
tributionoflignanderivativestotheanti-inﬂammatoryactivityof
this herbal product. The actions of the pure compounds isolated
on multiple targets may explainthe promising anti-inﬂammatory
activity of the CH2Cl2-soluble extract of K. lappacea roots.
Considering itspotency(higher thanindomethacin),this extract
may be able to be developed as a pharmaceutical agent for the
treatment of topical inﬂammatory processes, after suitable stan-
dardization and clinical safety evaluations.

Croton Oil-Induced Dermatitis. Male CD-1 mice weighing
28 32 g were supplied by Harlan Laboratories (San Pietro al Natisone,
Italy).Topicalinflammationwasinducedontherightear(surface:about
1c m
2) of anesthetized mice (145 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride,
intraperitoneally) applying 80 μg of croton oil dissolved in 15 μLo f
acetone. Theleft ear remained untreated, sincepreliminary experiments
showed that the vehicle (acetone) neither affected the inflammatory
response nor induced irritation. Control animals received only the
irritant solution, whereas other animals received both the irritant and
the test substances dissolved in acetone.
17 At different times after
dermatitis induction, animals were sacrificed and a punch (6 mm
Q
)
was taken from both ears to evaluate the edematous response. Ten
animals were used for each group of treatment. All animal experiments
compliedwiththeItalianD.L.n.116ofJanuary27,1992,andassociated
guidelines in the European Communities Council Directive of Novem-
ber24,1986(86/609ECC),concerninganimalwelfareandAppendixA
of the European Convention ETS 123.
Evaluation of the Edematous Response. Edema was quanti-
fied by the difference in weight between the punches taken from the
treated and untreated (opposite) ears. The antiedema activity was
expressed as percent inhibition of the edematous response in animals
treated with the test substances in comparison to edema of control
animals treated with the irritant alone.
17 The overall effect of the test
substances on edema development up to 48 h was quantified by
calculating the areas under the curves (AUCs) representing the edema-
tous response up to 48 h and, subsequently, by the ratio between the
AUCs of these animals and the AUCs of controls.
EvaluationoftheGranulocyteInfiltrate.Thecellularinfiltrate
was quantifiedbymeasuring myeloperoxidaseactivity,asanindexofthe
presence of neutrophilic granulocytes, in the same plug of treated ears
used to measure edema. Myeloperoxidase was extracted by HTAB,
according to the method of Bradley et al.,
21 and the enzyme activity was
measured by a colorimetric assay using TMB as chromogen.
22 Each ear
plug, suspended in 1mL of buffered saline (0.1 M sodium acetate buffer
at pH 4.2), containing 0.1% HTAB (w/v), was homogenized by Ultra-
Turrax (Ika-Werk, Staufen, Germany) for 5 s at 20000 rpm. The
homogenate was centrifuged at 15000g for 5 min, and the supernatant
was used for the colorimetric assay, because preliminary experiments
revealed that the pellet contained less than 5% of total myeloperoxidase
activity. In each well of a 96-well microplate, 25 μL of the supernatant
were mixed with 50 μL of the chromogen solution (2.83 mM TMB
dissolved in 0.1 M sodium acetate bufferat pH 4.2, containing 0.1% (w/v)
HTAB). The enzyme reaction was started by adding 75 μL of 0.7 mM
hydrogen peroxide. After 5 min of incubation at 25  C, the reaction was
blocked by 50 μL of 4 M acetic acid, containing 10 nM sodium azide.
The absorbance was read at 620 nm using an automated microplate
reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Myeloperoxidase activity
was expressed as enzyme units in 1 mL of supernatant. One unit of1785 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200343t |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1779–1786

Histological Analysis. Ear biopsies, fixed in 10% formalin, were
dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and
embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (10 μm) were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin or Giemsa and evaluated using a light microscope
(Zeiss Axiophot, with Photometrics Cool Snaps Camera and the RS-
image program).
Cell Culture. HEK-293/NFkB-luc cells were maintained at 37  C
and 5% CO2 in DMEM with phenol red supplemented with 2 mM
glutamine, 100 U/mL benzylpenicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and
10% fetal bovine serum. A549 cells were cultured in DMEM/high
glucose (4.5 g/L) medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum, 10% v/v, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at
37  C and 5% CO2.

Preparation of Crude mPGES-1 in Microsomes of A549
Cells and Determination of mPGES-1 Enzymatic Activity.
Determination of mPGES-1 activity was performed as described
previously.
26 In brief, A549 cells were treated with 1 ng/mL interleu-
kin-1β for 48 h at 37  C and 5% CO2. After cell harvesting and
sonification,thehomogenatewassubjectedtodifferentialcentrifugation
at 10000g for 10 min and 174000g for 1 h at 4  C. The obtained pellet
(microsomal fraction) was resuspended in 1 mL of homogenization
buffer (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl fluoride, 60 μg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/mL
leupeptin, 2.5 mM glutathione, and 250 mM sucrose), and the total
protein concentration was determined. Microsomal membranes were
diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing
2.5mMglutathione.Testcompounds,MK-886(referenceinhibitor),or
vehicle was added, and after 15 min at 4  C, the reaction (100 μL total
volume) was initiated by addition ofPGH2(20μM, finalconcentration,
unlessstatedotherwise).After1minat4 C,thereactionwasterminated
using stop solution (100 μL; 40 mM FeCl2, 80 mM citric acid, and
10 μM1 1 β-PGE2 as internal standard). PGE2 was separated by solid-
phase extraction and analyzed by RP-HPLC as described.

StatisticalAnalysis.Pharmacologicalinvivodatawereanalyzedby
one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s test for multiple
comparisons of unpaired data. The dose giving a 50% inhibition of the
edematous response (ID50) was calculated by graphic interpolation of
the logarithmic dose effect curves. To calculate the IC50 values
regarding NF-kB inhibition, at least three different concentrations
measured in quadruplicate in three independent transfection experi-
ments were used utilizing nonlinear regression with Data Analysis
Toolbox software (MDL Information Systems Inc., Nashville, TN).
For the determination of IC50 values in the remaining in vitro assays,
samplesweretestedinatleastthreedifferentconcentrations(duplicates;
at least three independent experiments). Calculation of IC50 values was
performedbynonlinearregressionusingSigmaPlot9.0(SystatSoftware
Inc., San Jose). Probability levels below 0.05 were considered as
statistically significant. Results are given as means ( SD.
