Hsp90functions with a cohort of co-chaperones to facilitate the folding,activation, and stabilization of numerous client proteins, many ofwhich have effects in regulating signal transduction pathways.1,2Among the plethora of Hsp90-dependent clients are proteins thatfunction in pathways that represent all six hallmarks of cancer.36Thus, inhibition of Hsp90 function simultaneously incapacitatesmultiple client proteins, providing a combinatorial attack oncellular oncogenic processes. Consequently, Hsp90 has emergedas an exciting new target for the development of antitumor agents.Natural product inhibitors of Hsp90 have been discoveredthat target binding sites in the N- and C-terminal domains ofHsp90. Geldanamycin (3) and radicicol, which are produced bythe soil actinomycetes species Streptomyces hygroscopicus and themycoparasitic fungus Humicola fuscoatra, respectively, bind tothe ATP binding pocket in Hsp90s N-terminal domain,1,2 whilenovobiocin (4), which is produced by Streptomyces spheroides,inhibits Hsp90 function by binding to Hsp90s C-terminaldomain.7 Other natural products with well-known antitumorand/or chemopreventive properties, but poorly characterizedmechanisms of action have been discovered to exhibit inhibitoryactivity toward Hsp90: epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),8,9 thewell-known antioxidant found in green tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)Kuntze); gedunin, a tetranortriterpenoid isolated from theIndian neem tree (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.; Meliaceae);10,11celastrol (2), a quinone methide triterpene that is a pharmaco-logically active compound present in Thunder God Vine rootextracts (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f.; Celastraceae);11,12 andthe rotenoid deguelin.13Derivatives of geldanamycin (3) and other compounds thattarget the ATP-binding pocket in Hsp90s N-terminal domainhave entered more than 20 clinical trials for the treatment ofcancer.5,14,15 Clinical complications have arisen in phase II trialsof several Hsp90 inhibitors, with incidences of hepato-, cardio-,and ocular toxicity having dampened enthusiasm for the clinicaluse of Hsp90 inhibitors.5 Consequently, there is an ongoingsearch for Hsp90 inhibitors with superior chemotherapeuticproperties for the treatment of cancers.To this end, we have screened natural product libraries forcompounds that inhibit Hsp90-dependent refolding of ther-mally denatured firefly luciferase. It was presumed that naturalproducts represent a fertile territory for the identification ofnew Hsp90-inhibitors, as it is reasonable to expect that evolu-tionary pressures give plants that produce secondary meta-bolites inhibitory to Hsp90 a competitive advantage, becausesuch compounds might inhibit the growth and development ofinsect pests and other pathogens. Celastrol (2), a knownHsp90inhibitor,11,12 and ()-gambogic acid (1), a component ofGarcinia hanburyi Hook.f. (Clusiaceae), a species that has beenused medicinally for centuries in southeast Asia, were identifiedas inhibitors of luciferase refolding in screens of two naturalproduct libraries.Gambogic acid (1), like Hsp90 inhibitors, has antitumor,antiangiogenic, and antimetastatic activities (reviewed in refs1618), but a poorly characterized mechanism of action. Inaddition, like Hsp90 inhibitors,19 1 has been observed to beselectively cytotoxic to cancer versus normal cells.20,21 While 1Received: January 10, 2011ABSTRACT:A high-throughput screening of natural product libraries identified ()-gambogic acid(1), a component of the exudate of Garcinia harburyi, as a potential Hsp90 inhibitor, in addition tothe known Hsp90 inhibitor celastrol (2). Subsequent testing established that 1 inhibited cellproliferation, brought about the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins in cultured cells, and inducedthe expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are hallmarks of Hsp90 inhibition. Gambogic acid alsodisrupted the interaction of Hsp90, Hsp70, and Cdc37 with the heme-regulated eIF2R kinase (HRI,an Hsp90-dependent client) and blocked the maturation of HRI in vitro. Surface plasmon resonancespectroscopy indicated that 1 bound to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 with a low micromolar Kd,in a manner that was not competitive with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (3). Molecular dockingexperiments supported the posit that 1 binds Hsp90 at a site distinct from Hsp90s ATP bindingpocket. The data obtained have firmly established 1 as a novel Hsp90 inhibitor and have providedevidence of a new site that can be targeted for the development of improved Hsp90 inhibitors.1086 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200029q |J.

Screening of natural product libraries pur-chased from Microsource and Biomol for compounds thatinhibited Hsp90-dependent refolding of luciferase identified 1as a potential Hsp90 inhibitor, along with the known Hsp90inhibitor celastrol (2), among other compounds. Neithercelastrol nor 1 had any direct effect on the activity of nativeluciferase. Upon titration of various concentrations of the twocompounds into the refolding assay (Figure 1A), celastrol (2)and gambogic acid (1) were found to inhibit luciferaserefolding by 50% (IC50) at a concentration of 20 and 2 μM,respectively.Gambogic acid (1) has been demonstrated in numerousstudies to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines(reviewed in refs 1618). To determine whether antiprolifera-tive activity of 1 could be correlated with its Hsp90-inhibitoryactivity, we examined the effect of varying concentrations ofgambogic acid on the growth/viability of HeLa cells and MCF7and SK-Br3 breast cancer cell lines. Gambogic acid (1)inhibited the proliferation of HeLa, MCF7, and SK-Br3 cellsin a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Growth ofthe HeLa, MCF7, and SK-Br3 cells was inhibited by 50%by treatment with 1.5, 2.0, and 0.8 μM 1, respectively.The highest concentrations of 1 were cytotoxic, as evidencedby detachment of a significant number of cells from the surfaceof the culture flasks. Thus, the IC50 of 1 for inhibition of cellproliferation correlated well with its IC50 for the inhibition ofluciferase refolding.Gambogic Acid (1)-Induced Depletion of Hsp90-Depen-dent Proteins. Treatment of cultured cells with known Hsp90inhibitors depletes the cells of Hsp90-dependent proteins in atime- and concentration-dependent manner. To further charac-terize 1 as a potential Hsp90 inhibitor, MCF7 and Sk-Br3 cellswere treated with varying concentrations of 1 for 36 h, andequivalent amounts of protein from cell extracts were Westernblotted for Hsp70 andHsp90 and theHsp90-dependent proteinsHer2, Akt, and Raf-1, using actin as a loading control, geldana-mycin (3) as a positive control for Hsp90 inhibition, and DMSOas a negative control. Gambogic acid was observed to depleteFigure 1. Effect of gambogic acid (1) and celastrol (2) on Hsp90-dependent luciferase refolding in reticulocyte lysate (A) and effect of 1on cell proliferation of HeLa cells and MCF7 and SkBr3 breast cancercells (B). Experiments were carried out as described in the ExperimentalSection.1087 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200029q |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1085–1092Journal of Natural Products ARTICLEMCF7 and Sk-Br3 cells of Her2, Akt, and Raf-1 in a concentra-tion-dependent fashion (Figure 2), which correlated well withthe IC50 value for inhibition of the proliferation of these cell linesinduced by 1. In addition, 1 induced Hsp90 and Hsp70 expres-sion, another hallmark of Hsp90 inhibition. This compound hada similar effect on the levels of Her2, Raf-1, and Akt in HeLa cells(not shown). These results further support the hypothesis thatthe antiproliferative effect of 1 on cancer cell growth is mediated,at least in part, by its ability to inhibit Hsp90.Effect of Gambogic Acid (1) on the Association of Hsp90Chaperone Components with HRI and HRI’s Hsp90-Depen-dent Maturation. Hsp90 inhibitors have distinct effects on theconformation and interactions of Hsp90 with co-chaperonepartners and clients.25,26 Geldanamycin (3), an Hsp90 inhibitorthat binds to the ATP pocket in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90(N-terminal inhibitor), causes Hsp90 to accumulate in com-plexes that contain intermediate co-chaperone components.Complexes that form between Hsp90 and kinase clients in thepresence of 3 are salt-labile and lack Cdc37. Molybdate, on theother hand, inhibits Hsp90 by freezing it in complexes containinglate co-chaperone components. Hsp90-kinase client complexesformed in the presence of molybdate are stabile at high saltconcentrations (e.g., 0.5 M NaCl) and contain Cdc37. Hsp90inhibitors that bind to its C-terminal domain (C-terminalinhibitor), like novobiocin (4), appear to block the interactionof Hsp90 with most co-chaperones, as well as protein clients.Celastrol (2), which is thought to bind to the N-terminal domainof Hsp90 at a site distinct from the ATP binding pocket, inhibitsHsp90 in a manner distinct from geldanamycin (3) and novo-biocin (4).25HRI is a heme-regulated eIF2R kinase that requires Hsp90,Hsp70, and Cdc37 for its maturation and activation underheme-deficient conditions.2729 To further characterize the mecha-nism of action of gambogic acid (1), the effects of 1 on the binding ofHsp90 chaperone components to HRI were compared to theeffects of the N-terminal inhibitors geldanamycin (3) andcelastrol (2), molybdate, and the C-terminal inhibitors novobio-cin (4) and coumermycin A1 (5).25 The nonactivatable K199Rmutant of HRI was used in these experiments, as it is unable tomature and interacts constitutively with Hsp90. In these experi-ments, the immunoadsorbed samples were washed with lowionic strength buffer, as it distinguishes between the mechanismof action of geldanamycin (3) and celastrol (2), which bind todifferent sites in the Hsp90s N-terminal domain. In agreementwith results reported previously,3032 (1) geldanamycin (3)caused the accumulation of Hsp90 in complexes with HRI/K199R that contained increased amounts of the intermediate co-chaperone component Hsp70 compared to the DMSO control,but lacked Cdc37 (Figure 3A, lane 3); (2) molybdate stabilizedthe binding of Hsp90 and Cdc37 to HRI/K199R, while notaffecting the interaction of Hsp70 with HRI/K199R (lane 4);and (3) novobiocin (4) disrupted the interaction of Hsp90,Hsp70, and Cdc37 with HRI/K199R (lane 6), as did the bivalentnovobiocin-related compound coumermycin A1 (5) (lane 7).Under similar conditions, celastrol (2) disrupted the bindingof Hsp90, Hsp70, and Cdc37 to HRI (Figure 3A, lane 5), asdid gambogic acid (1) (lane 8). These results indicate that 1affected the interaction of Hsp90 chaperone components withHRI/K199R in a manner distinct from geldanamycin (3) andmolybdate.Subsequently, the effects of 1 on HRI activation were exam-ined upon incubation in heme-deficient lysate. Hsp90-dependentmaturation and activation ofHRI are accompanied by a change inits electrophoretic mobility to a more slowly migrating species(Figure 3B). After 45min of incubation of HRI in heme-deficientlysate, approximately half of the [35S]HRI had a slower electro-phoretic mobility upon SDS-PAGE analysis compared to HRIincubated in heme-replete lysate (lane 2 versus 1). Gambogicacid (1) inhibited the maturation/activation of HRI in heme-deficient lysate to an extent similar to the known Hsp90inhibitors geldanamycin (3), celastrol (2), and molybdate. TheC-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors novobiocin (4) and coumermycinA1 (5) also inhibited thematuration/activation of HRI, but it wasalso apparent that incubation with these compounds reduced thequantity of [35S]HRI that was present in the samples comparedto the other Hsp90 inhibitors.To determine whether the decreased recovery of [35S]HRIwas a hallmark of C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors inducing thebreakdown of HRI or whether it was simply due to less [35S]HRIbeing synthesized, aliquots were taken from each sample afterprotein synthesis had ceased, prior to the beginning of thematurational incubation in the presence of the compounds.Autoradiography of aliquots taken from samples prior to theirmaturational incubation indicated that an equivalent amount of[35S]HRI was present in each sample (Figure 3C, 0 min: upperpanel). Incubation of [35S]HRI in the presence of novobiocin(4) or coumermycin A1 (5) resulted in a 90% and 80% loss of the[35S]HRI, respectively (Figure 3C, lanes 6 and 7). However,significantly less [35S]HRIwas lost upon incubation of samples inthe presence of geldanamycin (3) (0%), molybdate (10%),celastrol (2) (40%), or 1 (10%) compared to the DMSO control.A similar effect of novobiocin (4) and coumermycin A1 (5) hasbeen observed on the stability of Akt generated by TnT inreticulocyte lysate (not shown). Thus, the effect of Hsp90Figure 2. Gambogic acid (1)-induced degradation of Hsp90 clientproteins. Compound 1 was incubated with (A) MCF7 and (B) SkBr3breast cancer cells at concentrations (μM) indicated in the figure.Gambogic acid (1) was evaluated for its ability to downregulate severalclient proteins as described in the Experimental Section. Geldanamycin(3) (500 nM) and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls,respectively. Cell extracts were prepared and equivalent amounts ofprotein were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently Westernblotted for the indicated proteins as described in the ExperimentalSection.1088 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200029q |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1085–1092Journal of Natural Products ARTICLEinhibition on the stability of nascent kinases in reticulocyte lysateappears to be a property that further distinguishes inhibitors ofHsp90 that bind to its C-terminal domain from inhibitors thatbind to its N-terminal domain.25,26 The absence of an effect of 1on HRI stability distinguishes its mechanism of action from thatof C-terminal inhibitors. Previously, celastrol (2) was demon-strated to inhibit Hsp90 by a mechanism that was distinct fromN-terminal inhibitors that bind to the Hsp90s ATP bindingpocket, such as geldanamycin (3).25 The results presented hereindicate that the mechanism of action of 1 is similar to that ofcelastrol (2) and distinct from that of 3.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis of the Bindingof Gambogic Acid (1) to the N-Terminal Domain of Hsp90.To determine whether 1 is indeed interacting with the Hsp90sN-terminal domain, we cloned the N-terminal domain ofHsp90R (Hsp90NT; amino acids 1241) with a seven-amino-acid extension at its C-terminus containing a C-terminal Cysresidue. Recombinant Hsp90NT was biotinylated and immobi-lized onto a neutravidin sensor chip for analysis of the binding of1 by SPR. Full-length Hsp90 and the C-terminal domain ofHsp90 (Hsp90CT, amino acids 531732) were immobilized onsensor chips that were used as positive and negative controls,respectively. Gambogic acid (1) was observed to bind specificallyto full-length Hsp90 (Figure 4A) andHsp90NT (Figure 4B), butnot to Hsp90CT (data not shown). Analysis of binding anddissociation kinetics indicated that 1 binds to both Hsp90 andHsp90NT with similar association constants (ka), dissociationconstants (kd), and calculated Kd values (9.8 versus 7.6 μM,respectively, Table 1). Compound 1 was observed also to bindHsp90NT in the presence of 20 μM geldanamycin in the analyteFigure 3. Effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the interaction of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones with HRI (A), on HRI’s Hsp90-dependent maturation (B), andon HRI stability (C). (A) [35S]His-tagged HRI/K199R was synthesized by TnT in reticulocyte lysate as described in the Experimental Section. After10 min, DMSO (4% v/v, lanes 1 and 2), geldanamycin (3, 80 μM, lane 3), sodiummolybdate (20 mM, lane 4), celastrol (2, 100 μM, lane 5), novobiocin(4, 4.0 mM, lane 6), coumermycin A1 (5, 400 μM, lane 7), or gambogic acid (1, 50 μM, lane 8) was added, followed by an additional 40 min ofincubation. [35S]His-tagged HRI/K199R was then immunoadsorbed with anti-His antibodies, and samples were analyzed for coadsorbing Hsp90,Hsp70, and Cdc37 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

(B) [35S]His-tagged HRI was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate as described in the ExperimentalSection. After 20 min, DMSO (4% v/v, lanes 1, 2, and 3), geldanamycin (3, 80 μM, lane 4), sodium molybdate (20 mM, lane 5), celastrol (2, 100 μM,lane 6), novobiocin (4, 4.0 mM, lane 7), coumermycin A1 (5, 400 μM, lane 8), or 1 (50 μM, lane 9) was added, followed by an additional 10 min ofincubation. An aliquot of the TnT lysate was then transferred to hemin-supplemented (20 μM, lane 2) or heme-deficient (lanes 1 and 312) lysatecontaining an equivalent concentration of each addition, followed by an additional 45 min of incubation. The samples were then analyzed for HRImaturation by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described in the Experimental Section. Lane 1: TnT lysate containing no plasmid. [35S]HRI*: mature,active HRI.

Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1085–1092Journal of Natural Products ARTICLEbuffer, with geldanamycin (3) having no significant effect on themeasured ka and kd or the calculatedKd (Table 1). Thus, the dataindicate that gambogic acid binds to the N-terminal domain ofHsp90, and, like celastrol,11 it binds to a site distinct from theATP binding pocket. In addition, the Kd for the binding of 1 toHsp90 correlated well with the IC50 values for gambogic acid(1)-induced inhibition of other Hsp90-dependent processes,further supporting Hsp90 as one of the physiological targets ofthis compound.Virtual Docking of Gambogic Acid (1) to Hsp90NT. Weapproached the problem of identifying the putative binding siteof gambogic acid (1) in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 usingthe “blind” docking method,33 in which the entire Hsp90N-terminal domain, not just the geldanamycin-binding site,was used to search for the lowest possible binding energy for 1.The apo- and geldanamycin-bound Hsp90NT crystal structure,PDB ID 1YET, along with the open or unbound crystal structureof the Hsp90NT, PDB ID 1YES, were used for docking of 1 todetermine if it would compete for the geldanamycin-binding siteor bind elsewhere. These two structures share a 0.25 Å rmsd ofthe CR backbone spanning the entire 221 residues of the crystalstructures with the majority of conformational changes occurringin residues 105112.34 In all three docking experiments, 1preferentially bound to the cleft created by R-helix 9 (H9) andβ-sheet strand 8 (S8), residues 200222 (Figure 5A) that arecomposed of both hydrophobic and positively charged elements(Figure 5B). The calculated average binding affinities for 1 forthis region were9.44,9.50, and9.37 kcal/mol for the apo-and geldanamycin-bound and open structures, respectively.Docking results predict that aliphatic hydrophobic interactionswould occur between the gambogic acid substituent arms and thealiphatic side chains of H9 and Phe213 in the intervening loop,while the xanthenone moiety would lie on the CR backbone ofS8, making a potential π interaction with the carbonyl and amidebonds (Figure 5A). In addition, there is a potential salt bridgebetween Lys208 of H9 and both oxygens of the carboxylic acidmoiety of 1, and a hydrogen bond between Lys204 of H9 and thecarbonyl moiety of the cyclohexene ring (Figure 5C). Theregions of H9 and S8 undergo minor conformational changeswith a 0.15 Å rmsd of the CR residues between residues200222.The docking results are consistent with gambogic acid (1)being a noncompetitive inhibitor of the Hsp90 N-terminaldomain. The region of H9 and S8 of the HSP90 N-terminaldomain undergoes little change between the geldanamycin-bound structure and the open conformation structure with a0.15 Å rmsd of the CR backbone of residues 200222. It shouldbe noted that this site is distinct from that previously proposedfor the binding of celastrol (2) to the Hsp90s N-terminaldomain.12Recently, the combination of gambogic acid (1) and celastrol(2) was reported to have a synergistic antitumor effect,35 anobservation that supports the notion that the two compoundsinteract with different sites within the N-terminal domain ofFigure 4.

The question of whether combinations of Hsp90 in-hibitors that act by different mechanisms will demonstrate similarsynergistic effects on cancer cell growth has yet to be explored,but the synergy exhibited by 1 and 2 suggests that such studieswould be productive. For example, the ability of C-terminalinhibitors, such as novobiocin, to block the activation of HSF136may potentiate the cytoxicity of N-terminal inhibitors of Hsp90,which induce heat shock protein expression.Conclusion. The data presented above firmly establish gam-bogic acid (1) as an inhibitor of Hsp90 and provide evidence of anew site that can be targeted for the development of improvedHsp90 inhibitors. Previous work with 1 has indicated that itreduces the activity or the levels of expression of well-knownHsp90-dependent clients (see: http://www.picard.ch/down-loads/Hsp90interactors.pdf and http://www.picard.ch/down-loads/Hsp90facts.pdf) that are involved in the regulation ofcell immortality (telomerase),37,38 cell growth (Akt, cSrc, Cdk2,and Cdk4),3941 apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin),4244angiogenesis (VEGFR),40,41 and metastasis (MMP2 andMMP9).22,45 Changes in levels of expression of proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and telomerase) appeared to occur primarilyat the level of transcription rather than through destabilization ofthe protein, as mRNA levels coding for the protein weredecreased. These changes, however, can still be accounted forby a mechanism invoking gambogic acid-induced inhibition ofHsp90, as NF-κB regulates the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, andsurvivin, as well as VEGF,17,22 and NF-κB activation is wellknown to be regulated by Hsp90.46 This notion is supported bythe observations that the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (3)inhibits the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by suppressing theactivation of NF-κB47 and has the same effects as gambogic acidon VEGFR signaling.48,49 Furthermore, telomerase expression isregulated by c-Myc, and Hsp90 inhibition has recently beendemonstrated to destabilize c-Myc,50 in addition to blocking theinteraction of Hsp90 with the telomerase promoter, whichsuppresses telomerase expression.51 While this article was inpreparation, gambogic acid (1) was confirmed to block NF-κBactivation through its ability to inhibit Hsp90.52 Thus, many ofthe physiological effects of 1 on cultured cells reported previouslyin the literature can be accounted for, in part, by its ability toinhibit Hsp90 function.’EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONScreen for Inhibitors of Hsp90-Dependent LuciferaseRefolding. Natural product libraries from Microsource and Biomolwere screened as previously described for inhibitors of Hsp90-depen-dent refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase.53 Positive hitswere then screened against native luciferase to eliminate false positivesthat were direct inhibitors of luciferase. Subsequently, celastrol (2,CalBiochem 219465, g95% by TLC) and gambogic acid (1, BiomolBML-AP305, 98% by TLC) were titrated into reticulocyte lysatecontaining thermally denatured luciferase to determine the concentra-tion of test compound required to inhibit luciferase refolding by 50%(IC50) compared to the DMSO control, as previously described.54Reactions were carried out in triplicate at room temperature in 96-wellmicrotiter plates, and experiments were repeated at least twice, withrelative light unit (RLU) production measured using a LMaxII(Molecular Devices) microplate reader and a 10 s integration time.54Effect of Gambogic Acid (1) on Cell Proliferation. MCF-7and HeLa cells were grown in Gibco modified essential medium,supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, and10% fetal bovine serum. SkBr3 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12(1:1) medium (Gibco) with L-glutamine supplemented with strepto-mycin (500 μg/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL), and 10% fetal bovineserum. Cells were grown to confluence in a humidified atmosphere(37 C, 5% CO2). Cells were seeded at 2000 cells per well in a clear 96-well plate, the medium volume was brought to 100 μL, and the cellswere allowed to attach overnight. The next day, varying concentrationsof compound or 1% DMSO vehicle control was added to the wells.Cells were then incubated at 37 C for 72 h. Cell viability wasdetermined using the Promega Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solutioncell proliferation assay. After incubation with compounds, 20 μL of theassay substrate solution was added to the wells, and the plate wasincubated at 37 C for an additional 1 h. Absorbance at 490 nm wasthen read on a Molecular Devices Versamax plate reader, and valueswere expressed as percent of absorbance from cells incubated inDMSO alone.Effect of Gambogic Acid (1) on the Interaction of Hsp90and Its Co-chaperones with Heme-Regulated eIF2R Kinase(HRI).His-tagged kinase-dead HRI/K199R was synthesized by coupledtranscriptiontranslation (TnT) in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of[35S]methionine.55,56 After 20 min of synthesis, compounds or anequivalent volume of DMSO or water was added at the concentrationsindicated in the figure legend, and synthesis was continued for anadditional 10 min. Subsequently, aliquots were taken for immunoad-sorption of His-tagged HRI with anti-His-tag antibodies bound to anti-mouse-IgG agarose resin.55,56 Agarose resins containing bound anti-His-tag antibody were washed four times with 10mMPIPES (pH = 7.2) plus100 mM NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting forcoadsorbed Hsp90, Hsp70, and Cdc37, as previously described.55,56Lysate lacking plasmid encoding His-tagged HRI was used as the controlfor nonspecific binding.Effect of Gambogic Acid (1) on Hsp90-Dependent HRIMaturation/Activation. [35S]His-tagged wild-type HRI or K199Rmutant was generated by TnT in reticulocyte lysate, as described above.After 30 min, samples were diluted into 7 volumes of hemin-supple-mented or heme-deficient lysate containing DMSO, water, or testcompound at the same concentration present in the TnT lysate andincubated for an additional 45 min.55,56 The His-tagged HRI wasadsorbed from samples by the addition of NTA-Ni resin on ice for 1 h.Resins were washed and eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, andsamples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography after elec-trotransfer to PVDF membrane to detect a shift in the electrophoreticmobility of HRI, which is dependent upon its Hsp90-dependentmaturation/activation.55,56Gambogic Acid (1)-Induced Depletion of Hsp90-Depen-dent Proteins from Cultured MCF7 and SKBr3 Breast Cancerand HeLa Cells. MCF-7, SkBr3, and HeLa cells were grown toconfluence as described above, seeded in culture dishes (1 106/dish),and allowed to attach overnight. Gambogic acid (1) was added at theconcentrations indicated in Figure 1, and the cells were incubated for anadditional 36 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed for Hsp90 clientprotein degradation (Her2, Raf-1, and Akt) and heat shock proteininduction (Hsp90 and Hsp70), as described previously.57 For compar-ison, cells were incubated with DMSO (1%) or geldanamycin(3, 500 nM), and extracts (10 μg of protein) were Western blottedfor the indicated proteins with actin used as the loading control. Onemicrogram of SkBr3 extracts was used for the Western blot for Her2.Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy of GambogicAcid (1) Binding to Hsp90. Insect Sf9 cells overexpressing humanHsp90β were cultured and harvested by the Baculovirus/MonoclonalAntibody Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. Hsp90β wasextracted and purified (>98% pure) as described previously,58,59 butwithout the initial DEAE-cellulose chromatography step. Bacterial E. coliDE-3 Star cells carrying plasmids for the expression of either the1091 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200029q |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1085–1092Journal of Natural Products ARTICLEN-terminal (Hsp90NT: amino acids 1241 with a C-terminalGELRSGC tail) or C-terminal (Hsp90CT: amino acids 531732)domains of Hsp90 were cultured in LBmedium and induced with IPTG.Recombinant Hsp90NT and Hsp90CT were purified using a NiNTAcolumn. Following elution of the protein from the NiNTA column, theN-terminal His-tag was cleaved using TEV protease (Invitrogen),followed by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200. TheHsp90-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against10mMHepes (pH 7.5) containing 150mMNaCl and 10% glycerol, andstored at 80 C until use. Prior to the use of the Hsp90NT orHsp90CT, each protein was reacted according to the manufacture’srecommended protocol with the EZ-Link Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin(Thermo Scientific) then buffer-exchanged into fresh 10 mM Hepes(pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl to eliminate free biotin entities.The surface of a SSO1 CO2H SPR sensor chip mounted in a SensiQSPR instrument (ICX Nomadics) was activated by treatment withN0-3-dimethylaminopropyl-N0-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hy-droxysuccinimide for preferential cross-linking of full-length Hsp90sN-terminus to the surface. For immobilization of Hsp90, 250 μL ofHsp90 (6.2 mg/mL) in 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing150mMNaCl was injected at a flow rate of 10 μL/min, resulting in 2000response units of protein captured on the experimental surface of thechip. Then, 1M ethanolamine (pH 8) was used to quench the remainingactivated groups, and the surface washed with buffer containing 10 mMPIPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 2% DMSO. The surface of a SSO3BioCap SPR sensor chip wasmounted in a SensiQ SPR instrument (ICXNomadics), and either the biotinylated Hsp90NT (7.0 mg/mL) orHsp90CT (6.8 mg/mL) was discrete-injected over the experimentalchannel at a flow rate of 10 μL/min, resulting in capture of Hsp90NT at1400 response units and Hsp90CT at 1250 response units of protein onthe experimental surface of the chip. The chips were then washed withassay buffer prior to experimental analysis.Gambogic acid (1) was diluted in assay buffer containing 10 mMPIPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 2% DMSO and injected over thesurface of each derivatized chip at a flow rate of 15 μL/min at 25 C at theindicated concentrations. Additionally, for competition studies 1 wasdiluted in assay buffer containing 20 μM geldanamycin (3). All measure-ments were done in triplicate. SPR binding curves were analyzed usingQDAT software (ICX Nomadics) to calculate the ka, kd, and KD data.Docking Studies of Geldanamycin (3) and Gambogic Acid(1) with the N-Terminal Domain of Hsp90. In silico docking ofgeldanamycin and gambogic acid with the 3D coordinates of the X-raycrystal structures of the N-terminal domain of HSP90 with bound 3 andin the open conformation, PDB IDs 1YET and 1YES, respectively, wasaccomplished using the AutoDock program60 downloaded from theMolecular Graphics Laboratory of the Scripps Research Institute. TheAutoDock program was chosen because it uses a genetic algorithm togenerate the poses of the ligand inside a known or predicted binding siteutilizing the Lamarckian version of the genetic algorithm where thechanges in conformations adopted by molecules after in situ optimiza-tion are used as subsequent poses for the offspring.In the docking experiments carried out, water was removed from the3D X-ray coordinates while Gasteiger charges were placed on the X-raystructures of the N-terminal domain of HSP90 along with geldanamycin(3) and 1 using tools from the AutoDock suite. A grid box centered onthe N-terminal HSP90 domain with definitions of 126  126  126points and 0.4 Å spacing was chosen for ligand docking experiments.The docking parameters consisted of setting the population size to 300,the number of generations to 27 000, and the number of evaluations to20 000 000, while the number of docking runs was set to 50 with a cutoffof 1 Å for the root-mean-square tolerance for the grouping of eachdocking run.While the binding mode of geldanamycin with Hsp90 has beendetermined through X-ray crystallography,34 the binding mode of 1withHsp90 has yet to be determined through either NMR spectroscopy orX-ray crystallography. The docking of geldanamycin to the apo X-raystructure of Hsp90NT, PDB ID 1YET, was used as a control to test andvalidate the docking parameters used. As expected, geldanamycin (3)docked to the binding site identified in the crystal structure with anaverage binding energy of9.65 kcal/mol and a 1 Å average root-mean-square deviation from the reference structure.’AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding Author*Tel: (405)744-6200.
