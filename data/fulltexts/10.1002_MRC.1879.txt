O. Box 653, Beer Sheva 84105, IsraelReceived 15 May 2006; Revised 13 June 2006; Accepted 14 June 2006The main saponin (1) present in the mesocarp of Balanites aegyptiaca fruit is a mixture of 22R and22S epimers of 26-(O-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-b-[4-O-(b-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-O-(a-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-b-D-glucopyranosyloxy]-22,26-dihydroxyfurost-5-ene. This structure differs fromapreviously reported saponinisolated from this source by the site of attachment of the rhamnosyl residue, and presumably represents astructural revision of the latter. The main saponin (2) present in the kernel is a xylopyranosyl derivativeof 1. The use of high-field NMR enabled the practically complete assignment of 1H and 13C chemicalshifts of these complex saponins, existing as a mixture of C-22 epimers. Moreover, the work represents anew approach to structural elucidation of saponins: direct preparative-scale HPLC-RID of crude extractsfollowed by high-field NMR investigations supported by ESI-MSn.

Delile (Zygophyllaceae), popularlyknown as desert date, is a spiny, evergreen tree commonlygrown in the arid regions of Africa, the Middle East,India and Burma.1 Numerous medicinal uses have beenreported for this plant.2 The saponins present in the fruitsshow molluscicidal activity, including toxicity against snailscarrying the Bilharziasis parasites, and it has been suggestedthat the trees be planted along infested waters so that thefruits could drop into the water spontaneously.2 Severalstudies on B. aegyptiaca saponins have been reported,describing the content of the spirostan saponins in the root,bark and seeds,3,4 furostan saponins in the fruit5 – 7 and theroot,8 and pregnane derivatives in the fruit.9Saponins are a widely distributed group of secondarymetabolites found in plants with numerous uses, tra-ditional as well as modern.10,11 The complexity andstructural diversity of saponins present a considerablechallenge to chromatographic separation12 and to struc-tural elucidation.10,11 Traditionally, structure elucidation ofsaponins often required extensive chemical derivatizationand degradation in order to identify the aglycone, the num-ber and type of sugar residues present, and their mutualŁCorrespondence to: Dan Stærk, Department of MedicinalChemistry, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Universitetsparken 2, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.E-mail: ds@dfuni.dkconnections. In this article, we describe a procedure for rapididentification of complex saponins from B. aegyptiaca fruitsbased on preparative-scale reversed-phase HPLC, ESI-MSn,and high-field NMR.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe mesocarps were separated manually and extracted withcold methanol. The extracts were defatted and resolveddirectly on a preparative HPLC column packed with octade-cylsilyl silica, using methanol–water (7 : 3) as eluent anda refractive index detector (RID). This procedure, whichcontrasts elaborate fractionation schemes used in the pre-vious studies,3 – 8 enabled rapid purification of B. aegyptiacasaponins using a minimum number of manipulations andchromatographic separation steps. The extract contained alarge proportion of sugars, which were eluted with the frontband, whereas saponins were differentially retarded on thecolumn, yielding pure compounds in a single purificationstep.The main saponin of B. aegyptiaca fruit mesocarp, isolatedin a yield corresponding to 0.55% of the mesocarp weight,was injected directly into an electrospray ionization massspectrometer (ESI-MS) operating in the negative-ion mode.13Multi-stage experiments (MSn) showed that the molecularion ([M  H], m/z 1063) was cleaved with a loss ofGlc (glucose) and Rha (rhamnose), as well as of (Glc CH2O), (Glc C Rha), (Glc C Rha C H2O), (2Glc C Rha C H2O),Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.924 D. Stærk et al.(3Glc C Rha), and (3Glc C Rha C H2O). The intensity of thepeak at m/z 901 ([M  H  Glc]) was somewhat higherthan that at m/z 917 ([M  H  Rha]), corresponding topreferential expulsion of Glc from the C-26 position of the[M  H] ion.13 The MS3 spectrum of the [M  H  Glc]ion (m/z 901) produced ions corresponding to the loss ofRha (m/z 755), Glc (m/z 739), and (Glc C Rha) (m/z 593).Further fragmentation (MS4) of the [M  H  Glc  Rha]ion (m/z 755) resulted in the loss of H2O (m/z 737),Glc (m/z 593), and (Glc C H2O) (m/z 575). In addition,MS of the [M  H  Glc], [M  H  Glc  Rha], and[M  H  Glc  Rha  Glc] ions showed elimination ofH2O, but the resulting ions always had low intensity.The 13C NMR spectra of the mesocarp saponin showedfour quaternary carbon resonances corresponding to C-5,C-10, C-13, and C-22 of a furostan. 1H NMR spectra at800 MHz provided excellent dispersion of the resonances,and showed a characteristic signal of the axially positionedH-3 (υ 3.59, triplet of triplets, J3,2ax D J3,4ax D 11.6 Hz,J3,2eq D J3,4eq D 4.6 Hz), an olefinic signal of H-6 at υ 5.38,and signals of five methyl groups. The resonances for themethyl groups were observed as two singlets (H-18 andH-19) and two doublets (H-21 and H-27) corresponding tothe aglycone, and a doublet attributable to the methyl groupof rhamnose. The presence of 13 methylene groups and 29methine groups was inferred from a DEPT135 spectrum.Resonances of three anomeric doublets (υ 4.23, 4.39, and4.51, J D 7.8–7.9 Hz) were attributable to glucose residues,whereas a doublet at υ 5.24 (J D 1.5 Hz) was compatible withthe presence of a rhamnose residue. Homonuclear (COSY,NOESY) and heteronuclear (HSQC, HMBC) correlationsobtained at 800 MHz allowed assignment of the entire setof 1H and 13C resonances, identifying the main saponinas 1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). In particular, the resonance of C-3(υ 79.4) showed long-range correlation to H-10 (υ 4.51) andthe latter a COSY correlation to H-20 (υ 3.42), providingchemical shift of C-20 (υ 78.7) from the HSQC spectrum.The resonance of C-20 showed a HMBC correlation to H-10000(υ 5.24), establishing the attachment point of rhamnose. Thesignal of C-40 (υ 81.0) showed HMBC correlation to H-100(υ 4.39), which established the attachment point of the secondglucose moiety. The last glucose residue was attached to C-26(υ 76.1), as shown by HMBC correlation between C-26 andH-1000 (υ 4.23). Numerous NOESY correlations confirmed thestructure, e.g. NOEs between H-10 and H-4eq, H-100 and H-40,and between H-10000 and H-20. That the saponin was a mixtureof 22R and 22S epimeric hemiacetals (ratio about 1 : 1) wasevident from the fact that H-16 appeared as two quartets(υ 4.37 and 4.56, J D 7.6 Hz), whereas H-20 gave two pentets(υ 2.10 and 2.18, J D 6.7 Hz), and the signals of carbon atomsaround C-22 were split into two closely spaced resonances(Table 1). 2D NMR connectivities (800 MHz COSY, NOESY,and HMBC) for 1 and 2 are given in the SupplementaryTables S1 and S2. The saponin was a pure 25R epimer, asshown by the resonance of H-27 and the chemical shiftdifference between the diastereotopic H-26 hydrogens, onlya single pair of which was present in the spectrum.14,15 Theorder of sugar residues established by NMR is in agreementwith the fragmentation pattern observed in the ESI-MSnexperiments.The major saponin (2) isolated from B. aegyptiaca fruitkernels contained an additional pentose residue (m/z 1195,[M  H]), identified as xylopyranosyl attached to O-300 onthe basis of 800 MHz 1D and 2D NMR spectra. Thus, theresonance of H-100000 of the xylopyranose moiety (υ 4.50,J D 7.6 Hz) correlated with that of C-300 (υ 87.7), and an NOECH3OOHCH3H3COH3COHOOROOR''OOR'HOHOHO1 R = α-L-rhamnopyranosyl, R' = R'' = H 2 R = α-L-rhamnopyranosyl, R' = H, R'' = β-D-xylopyranosyl3 R = R'' = H, R' = α-L-rhamnopyranosylOOHHOHOH3CH HHOOHHOHOα-L-rhamnopyranosyl =β-D-xylopyranosyl =12345 7891011121314 151617181920212322242526271'1''1'''1'''''1''''4'2''3''OOHOOHHOHOFigure 1.

Apart fromthese differences, the spectra of 1 and 2 were very similar,with the largest differences observed for the glucose residuebearing the xylopyranose ring (Table 1). All hydrogen atomsof the five sugar moieties could be uniquely assigned from 2Dcorrelations in spite of considerable signal overlap (Fig. 2).Compound 2 was the major saponin of B. aegyptiaca fruitkernels corresponding to 0.27%, but significant amounts of 1(0.22%) were also present in the kernels. In addition to 1 and2, all extracts contained small amounts of their derivatives inwhich the hydroxy group attached to C-22 was exchangedfor a methoxy group, presumably during extraction of theplant material with methanol.Previous investigations of B. aegyptiaca fruit resulted in areport of saponin 3, named balanitoside and differing from1 by the position of attachment of the rhamnose residueFigure 2. Fragment of 800 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of 2showing signals of the carbohydrate residues (CD3OD).(O-200 rather than O-20).6 The structure of 3 was based onacetylation-induced shifts without rigorous assignment of allcarbon resonances.6 Unfortunately, 13C NMR data reportedfor balanitoside do not allow any certain conclusionsabout its identity with 1, and the optical rotation ofbalanitoside was not reported.6 However, since 1 is themajor saponin of B. aegyptiaca fruit, we believe that itrepresents a structural revision of balanitoside. The saponin1 was previously isolated several times from other plants:Dioscorea deltoidesWall. (the saponin was named deltoside),16Ophiopogon planiscapus Nakai (glycoside F),17 Rhapis speciesand Sabal causiarum Becc. (as a 22-methoxy derivativedesignated methyl protodeltonin),18,19 Lilium species,20 – 22Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (along with its 25S epimernamed trigoneoside IVa),23 and Allium nutans L.24 Compound2 was previously reported as a mixture of 25S and 25Repimers in B. aegyptiaca root,8 but the pure 25R epimer wasnot isolated prior to this work.The present work, in addition to elucidation of structuresof B. aegyptiaca saponins, describes a useful, compact proto-col for rapid isolation of saponins based on HPLC-RID, anddemonstrates the power of high-field NMR spectroscopy,supported by ESI-MSn, for unambiguous de novo structuredetermination of complex saponins. Structure elucidation ofcomplex saponins usually requires chemical manipulation,typically acid hydrolysis for separate analysis of aglyconesand sugars or acetylation in order to increase dispersion of 1HNMR resonances.25 – 35 Unambiguous structure elucidation,including complete relative stereochemistry and sugar con-nectivities as shown in the present work, can be performedonly seldom with instrumental methods alone.36 – 38EXPERIMENTALGeneral experimental proceduresNMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using CD3OD assolvent and TMS as internal reference.
