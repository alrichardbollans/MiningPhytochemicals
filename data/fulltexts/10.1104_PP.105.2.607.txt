The biosynthetic pathway of 2’-deoxymugineic acid, a key phy- 
tosiderophore, was investigated by feeding 13C-, *H-, and 
‘5N-labeled methionine, the first precursor, to the roots of hydro- 
ponically cultured wheat (Triticum aestivum 1. cv Minori). The 
incorporation of label from each methionine species was observed 
during their conversion to 2‘-deoxymugineic acid, using ’H-, 15N-, 
and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). i-[l-13C]Methionine 
(99% 13C) was efficiently incorporated, resulting in 13C enrichment 
of the three carboxyl groups of 2‘-deoxymugineic acid. Use of D,L- 
[‘5N]methionine (95% 15N) resulted in ”N enrichment of 2‘-deoxy- 
mugineic acid at the azetidine ring nitrogen and the secondary 
amino nitrogen. When ~,~-[2,3,3-’H,-S-methyl-~H~]methionine 
(98.2% ’H) was fed to the roots, ’H-NMR results indicated that 
only six deuterium atoms were incorporated, and that the deute- 
rium atom from the C-2 position of each methionine was almost 
completely lost. [2,2,3,3-’H411-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic 
acid (98% *H) was not incorporated into 2‘-deoxymugineic acid. 
These data and our previous findings demonstrated that only the 
deuterium atom from the C-2 position of i-methionine was lost, 
and that other atoms were completely incorporated when three 
molecules of methionine were converted to 2’-deoxymugineic acid. 
These observations are consistent with the conversion of i-methi- 
onine to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, suggesting that i-methionine 
i s  first converted to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid during biosynthesis 
leading to 2‘-deoxymugineic acid. Based on these results, a hypo- 
thetical pathway from L-methionine to 2‘-deoxymugineic acid was 
postulated. 
Gramineous plants respond to iron stress by secreting 
mugineic acids, a group of ferric-chelating substances (Tak- 
agi, 1976; Takemoto et al., 1978). Until now, six of these 
compounds from different gramineous plants have been 
identified (Nomoto et al., 1987). In our previous report, two 
related biosynthetic pathways for these mugineic acids were 
described on the basis of feeding with ’H- and 13C-labeled 
compounds (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). These pathways differ 
after 2‘-deoxymugineic acid formation and are dependent on 
the plant species. In oat, avenic acid A is biosynthesized from 
2’-deoxymugineic acid by cleavage of the azetidine ring. In 
barley, hydroxylation at the C-2’ position of 2’-deoxymugi- 
neic acid yields mugineic acid. Further hydroxylation at the 
C-3 position produces 3-epihydroxymugineic acid in beer 
barley and 3-hydroxymugineic acid in rye (Ma and Nomoto, 
* Corresponding author; fax 81-75-962-2115. 
607 
1993, 1994). However, a11 of these pathways share the same 
steps from t-Met to 2’-deoxymugineic acid. 
We found no significant differences in solubilization and 
uptake of iron among different mugineic acids (Ma et al., 
1993). This suggests that 2’-deoxymugineic acid is the key 
compound, because it is the first to be biosynthesized and 
serves as a precursor for other mugineic acids. The biosyn- 
thesis of 2‘-deoxymugineic acid is also suggested as a key 
step for plants resistant to iron stress. Therefore, elucidating 
this pathway is helpful not only for isolation and purification 
of the related enzymes but also for subsequent cloning of 
genes encoding synthetic enzymes of 2’ -deoxymugineic acid. 
Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway between L-Met 
and 2’-deoxymugineic acid is limited. From the results of 
experiments in which t-[l-13C]Met was fed to roots of barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L. cv Minorimugi), elongation of Met units 
was considered as a hypothetical pathway (Kawai et al., 
1988). However, this pathway has not yet been verified. An 
in vitro study indicated that nicotianamine served as a pre- 
cursor of 2’-deoxymugineic acid (Shojima et al., 1990); how- 
ever, details of the pathway from t-Met to nicotianamine 
remain to be elucidated. 
In this study, feeding experiments with 13C-, ’H-, ”N- 
labeled Met, the first precursor, were conducted using roots 
of hydroponically cultured wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv 
Minori). From the observation of incorporation of label from 
each Met molecule during its conversion to 2’-deoxymugineic 
acid, a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway is proposed.

Plant Culture and Feeding 
Wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv Minori) were cul- 
tured hydroponically as previously reported (Ma and Nomo- 
to, 1993). Briefly, 80 selected seedlings (7 d old) were trans- 
planted into 3-L Wagner pots with continuously aerated 
nutrient solution in an environmental chamber. Three-tenths- 
strength Hoagland solution containing 1.5 m~ KN03, 1.5 m~ 
Ca(N03)*, 0.6 m~ MgS04, and 0.3 m~ NH4H2P03 was used 
for the culture. Micronutrients were employed at the full

adjusted to pH 5.5 with 0.1 N KOH and replaced every 2 d. 
The light intensity was about 40 W/m2, and the light/ 
dark period and temperatures were 14/10 h and 17/1OoC, 
respec tively . 
After 2 weeks, the plants were subjected to iron deficiency 
by transferring them to pots containing the above nutrient 
solution but free of iron. Feeding experiments were per- 
formed with 80 plants each with nutrient solution minus iron 
for 11 to 13 d in 3-L Wagner pots containing the Hoagland 
solution. After the secretion of 2'-deoxymugineic acid, the 
roots were fed with the following labeled compounds: (a) 
100 ~ L M  ~-[l- '~C]Met (99.0% I3C, Isotec, Inc., Miamisburg, 
OH); (b) 100 p~ D,L-[ '~N]M~~ (95% "N, Berlin-Adlershof, 
Berlin, Germany); (c) 100 p~ ~,~-[2,3,3-~H~-S-methyl-~H~]Met 
(98.2% 'H, Merck Sharp & Dohme/Isotopes, Montreal, Can- 
ada); (d) 50 PM [2,2,3,3-'H4]ACC (98% 'H, Sigma). The 
compounds were dissolved in the nutrient solution. Because 
a prior experiment showed that the surface-active agent 
Decaglyn 1-L (Nikko Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) stimulated 
Met uptake, 40 pg mL-' pot-' was added during feeding 
experiments . 
lsolation and Purification 
Isolation of 2'-deoxymugineic acid was performed as pre- 
viously reported (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). Briefly, root wash- 
ings were collected the following day by soaking the roots in 
distilled water (3 L x 3) from 3 to 5 h after the onset of the 
light period. The root washings were then purified by chro- 
matography (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). 
NMR and FAB-MS Study 
Samplles of 2'-deoxymugineic acid were dissolved in D20 
or HzO for NMR spectroscopy at 400 ('H), 61.3 ('H), or 75.5 
MHz ("(3. The conditions for 'H-, 'H-, and l3C-1VMR mea- 
surement were the same as those previously reported (Ma 
and Nomoto, 1993). Peaks in both the 'H and I3C: spectra of 
2'-deoxymugineic acid have previously been assigned (Kawai 
et al., 19138; Ma and Nomoto, 1993). Because 'H arid 'H shifts 
correspoind except for a small isotope effect and broadening, 
'H assignment was accomplished based on that of 'H. The 
I3C enrichment was calculated from the line interisity of the 
C-3 posifion. The 15N-NMR spectra of 2'-deoxymugineic acid 
(D20) wlere measured at 30.5 MHz (GN-300 spectrometer) 
under the following conditions: pulse width, 10.0 ps; acqui- 
sition time, 1.36 s; recycle time, 2.35 s; number of acquisitions, 
22,112; data size, 16,384. NH4N03 was used as ,an extemal 
reference to calibrate the chemical shift. FAB-MS (JEOL JMS- 
HX 110/110A) spectra for 'H- and "N-labeled ,md nonla- 
beled 2'-deoxymugineic acid were recorded at 10 kV using a 
glycerol matrix. The 'H and 15N enrichment of 2'-deoxymu- 
gineic acid were calculated from the mass spectra. 
RESULTS AND DlSCUSSlON 
The acquisition of iron by gramineous plants is character- 
ized by secretion of femc-chelating substances, th e mugineic 
acids. Most species and cultivars secrete two or more com- 
pounds (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). However, wheat seaetes

key phytosiderophore. Therefore, wheat is a good experi- 
mental model to study the biosynthetic pathway from L-Met 
to 2’-deoxymugineic acid. 
To obtain information about the biosynthetic pathway 
between L-Met and 2’-deoxymugineic acid, we studied how 
the first precursor, L-Met, is incorporated into 2’-deoxymu- 
gineic acid. When [l-13C]Met was fed to the roots, 11.7 mg 
of purified 2’-deoxymugineic acid was obtained. The I3C- 
NMR study showed that the C-1, -4‘, and -4‘’ positions of 
2‘-deoxymugineic acid were I3C enriched 20.3, 19.8, and 
21.8 times, respectively, by comparison of their peak heights 
with those of unlabeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid (Table I). This 
result suggests that the three carboxyl groups of 2’-deoxy- 
mugineic acid were formed from the carboxyl groups of three 
Met molecules. This result is in agreement with previous 
findings in barley (cv Minorimugi) (Kawai et al., 1988). 
When D,L-[”N]M~~ was fed to the roots, a ”N-NMR study 
of isolated 2’-deoxymugineic acid (9.9 mg) showed two peaks 
at 61.8 and 54.6 ppm, which represented approximately a 
10-fold ”N enrichment. These peaks were assigned to the 
azetidine ring nitrogen and the secondary amino nitrogen. 
This result suggests that two nitrogen atoms in the 2‘-deoxy- 
mugineic acid resulted from nitrogen of L-Met. 
When ~,~-[2,3,3-’H~-S-methyl-~H~]Met (98.2% ’H) was fed 
to the roots, the isolated 2’-deoxymugineic acids (21.6 mg) 
were 2H enriched by about 10-fold. The ’H-NMR study 
indicated that the ratio of the peak intensities at 2.72, 2.52, 
and 2.15 ppm was about 1:1:4 (Fig. 1); in all, six deuterium 
atoms were present. According to the ‘H-NMR assignment, 
these peaks correspond to deuterium on the C-3, C-2’, and 
C-2” positions, respectively. If 2 ’-deoxymugineic acid is 
formed from three molecules of Met (Kawai et al., 1988; Ma 
and Nomoto, 1993), nine deuterium atoms from [2,3,3-’H3- 
S-methyl-*H3]Met should be present in the 2’-deoxymugineic 
acid. Even if transamination and subsequent reduction at the 
C-3” position caused the loss of deuterium at the C-3” 
position, the deuterium at the C-2 and C-3’ positions would 
be retained. However, the peak intensity of the deuterium at 
the C-3‘ position was much lower than that of deuterium at 
the C-2’ position originating from the same L-Met (Fig. 1). 
The signal for the C-2 deuterium atom overlapped with the 
D 2 0  signal (Fig. 1). To observe this signal, ‘H-NMR mea- 
surement of the same sample was performed at a lower 
temperature (10OC). As a result, the D20 signal was shifted 
to a lower field (data not shown), but the peak for the C-2 
deuterium atom was observed to be as small as the one for 
the C-3’ deuterium. This indicates that the deuterium atoms 
at the C-2 and C-3‘ positions from the C-2 position of Met 
are almost completely lost when the Met molecules are con- 
verted to 2’-deoxymugineic acid. 
In a previous study, when ~,~-[3,3,4,4-’H,]Met was fed to 
the roots, 12 deuterium atoms were observed in the 2’- 
deoxymugineic acid (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). This suggested 
that a11 deuterium atoms from C-3 and C-4 positions of three 
’H-labeled Met molecules were incorporated during biosyn- 
thesis. Based on these results, Figure 2 summarizes the incor-

at different positions during conversion to 2’-deoxymugineic 
acid in the roots of wheat. It is clear that except for the 
hydrogen at C-2, C-3‘, and C-3” and the terminal hydroxyl, 
a11 other atoms in 2’-deoxymugineic acid are formed from 
three molecules of Met. These results eliminate aspartic p- 
semialdehyde and 4-amino-2-oxobutanoic acid as interme- 
diates between Met and 2’-deoxymugineic acid, because if 
they were intermediates, the deuteriums from the C-4 posi- 
tion of [3,3,4,4-’H4]Met and nitrogen from [15N]Met would 
not be observed in the 2‘-deoxymugineic acid biosynthesized 
from these labeled Met molecules (Ma’ and Nomoto, 1993; 
Fig. 1). 
The mechanism for loss of deuterium from the C-2 position 
of Met during the conversion is still unknown. If each of the 
Met precursor forms a Schiff‘s base with pyridoxal phos- 
phate, an enzyme cofactor, before they are converted to 2’- 
deoxymugineic acid, the deuterium from the C-2 position of 
Met will be lost. However, an in vitro study indicated that 
the step from Met to nicotianamine needs no cofactor (Mori, 
1993), suggesting that this mechanism for deuterium loss is 
unlikely. 
The precursor of ethylene is ACC, and it is also formed 
from L-Met (Yang and Hoffman, 1984). The formation of 
ACC from L-Met could also similarly result in the loss of the 
deuterium at the C-2 position in Met as described above. 
Therefore, ACC could be the precursor of 2‘-deoxymugineic 
acid. However, feeding [2,2,3,3-*H4]ACC to the wheat roots 
did not result in the incorporation of ’H atom into the isolated 
2’-deoxymugineic acid (8.2 mg). 
Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is a four-membered cyclic im- 
ino acid that is distributed among severa1 members of the 
Liliaceae, a few species of Agavaceae and Amaryllidaceae, 
and other plant species (Leete et al., 1974). Its biosynthesis 
has been intensively investigated, especially in Convalaria 
majalis (lily of the valley). In this plant, L-Met was found to 
be the precursor for azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Leete et al., 
1974, 1986). Met labeled with 14C at C-1 and with 3H at the 
C-4 position is incorporated into azetidine-2-carboxylic acid 
with complete retention of the 3H relative to 14C (Leete et al., 
1974). Feeding [l-14C,15N]Met results in the same specific 
incorporation of these two isotopes into azetidine-2-carbox- 
ylic acid (Leete et al., 1986). The azetidine-2-carboxylic acid 
derived from [1-14C,2-3H]Met almost completely loses the 3H 
(95%) from the C-2 position (Leete et ai., 1974), and [l-13C- 
~arboxyl-’~C-’~N]ACC is not incorporated. These results are 
consistent with the present findings (Table I; Fig. 1) and our 
previous observation of L-Met conversion to 2‘-deoxymugi- 
neic acid (Ma and Nomoto, 1993), thus suggesting that L-Met 
is first converted to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and then to 
2’-deoxymugineic acid. 
2S,3 ’S-N-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)azetidine-2-carbox- 
ylic acid and nicotianamine are easily produced chemically 
from azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Kristensen and Larsen, 
1974). An in vitro study indicated that nicotianamine serves 
as a precursor of 2’-deoxymugineic acid (Shojilna et al., 
1990). These findings led us to postulate a hypothetical 
biosynthetic pathway between L-Met and 2’-deoxymugineic 
acid (Fig. 3). Studies on this pathway are now in progress.
