Abstract
Background: Breast cancer is a major problem in the United States leading to tens of thousands
of deaths each year. Although citrus auraptene suppresses cancer in numerous rodent models, its
role in breast cancer prevention previously has not been reported. Thus, our goal was to determine
the anticarcinogenic effects of auraptene against breast cancer.
Methods: The effects of auraptene on cell proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast
carcinoma cells in culture was assessed by measuring metabolism of a substrate to a formazan dye.
Dietary effects of auraptene on tumor incidence, multiplicity and latency were studied in the N-
methyl nitrosourea (MNU) induced mammary carcinogenesis model in female Sprague Dawley rats.
The concentration of auraptene in rat tissues was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. Cyclin D1
expression in MCF-7 cells and rat tumors was measured by western blot.
Results: Auraptene (500 ppm) significantly delayed median time to tumor by 39 days compared to
the MNU only group (p < 0.05, n = 24–26). Auraptene (10 μM) reduced Insulin like Growth Factor-
1 (IGF-1, 10 ng/mL)-induced cyclin D1 expression by 40% in MCF-7 cells. In comparison, western
blot analysis of rat mammary tumors (n = 10 per group) confirmed that auraptene (500 ppm)
significantly reduced (p < 0.05) cyclin D1 expression by 49% compared to the MNU only group.
Analysis of rat mammary tissue extract by HPLC with fluorescence detection indicated an average
concentration (means ± S.E.) of 1.4 ± 0.5 μM and 1.8 ± 0.3 μM in the normal mammary glands of
the auraptene 200 ppm and 500 ppm groups, respectively. The concentration (means ± S.E.) of
auraptene in the mammary tumors of the auraptene 200 ppm group was 0.31 ± 0.98 μM.
Conclusion: Overall, these observations suggest that the predominant effect of auraptene was to
delay the development of tumors possibly through the suppression of cyclin D1 expression. These
results point to the potential chemopreventive effects of auraptene in mammary carcinogenesis.

Background
Breast cancer is a major cause of death in women under
the age of 55. In the year 2008, 184,450 new cases of
breast cancer (182,460 women and 1990 men) and
40,930 deaths (40,480 women and 450 men) are
expected [1]. Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as
the leading cause of cancer deaths in women [1]. Many
risk factors have been attributed to breast cancer occur-
rence. Genetic susceptibility accounts for only ~10% of
human breast cancer [1]. Known environmental risk fac-
tors include radiation, obesity, and alcohol use [1].
Since breast cancer remains as a major threat to women's
health all over the globe, prevention of breast cancer is an
ideal strategy. Generally carcinogenesis is considered to
consist of three steps- initiation, promotion and progres-
sion [2]. The promotion stage is usually a lengthy process
which could be reversible. Thus there is an opportunity to
prevent carcinogenesis from progressing to the malignant
stage [2]. Many natural dietary compounds are being tried
for chemoprevention of cancer One such agent,
auraptene, is a geranyloxy-coumarin obtained from citrus
fruits [3]. Recently it has been shown that the leaves of an
aromatic plant Zanthoxylum schinifolium (used in Korea
and Japan as a food flavor and herbal medicine) [4] and
fruits of Paliurus ramosissimus [5] also contain
auraptene. Auraptene was effective in preventing the
chemical carcinogenesis in various rodent models includ-
ing skin [3], tongue [6], esophagus [7], liver [8,9], and
colon carcinogenesis [10-13]. Auraptene has also been
shown to have protective effects in a prostate [14] cancer
model. However, its chemopreventive effects have not
been addressed in animal models of breast cancer. Several
mechanisms have been reported for auraptene's chemo-
preventive properties including induction of carcinogen
detoxifying enzymes, induction of apoptosis [3,4,15,16],
inhibition of free radical generation [17] metalloprotein-
ase [18,19], inflammatory pathways [6,20] and
polyamine synthesis [6,20]. These varied mechanisms
and protective effects in rodent models of cancer com-
bined with the low risk of toxicity [21] suggest that
auraptene might be a good candidate for breast cancer
chemoprevention. In addition, coumarins generally pos-
sess high oral bioavailability [22]. Studies from our labo-
ratory have also suggested that orally administered citrus
coumarins were absorbed and distributed to various
organs in the body [15,23,24]. Based on these studies, we
hypothesized that auraptene could suppress mammary
carcinogenesis.
To address whether auraptene may be effective against
breast cancer, the effects of auraptene on the proliferation
of human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,
were assessed. Next, the effect of auraptene on protein
expression of the cell cycle protein, cyclin D1 was ana-
lyzed. We hypothesized that auraptene could suppress
mammary carcinogenesis by suppressing cyclin D1
expression. The rat mammary MNU model is a well-estab-
lished model for the evaluation of the chemopreventive
activities of drugs and natural products [25]. Rats treated
with the carcinogen MNU will develop mammary adeno-
carcinomas as early as 4 weeks post treatment and achieve
nearly 100% tumor incidence by 20 weeks[25]. About
50% of the tumors that arise possess a mutated ras. The
histopathology is considered to be similar to humans in
that most of the tumors are adenocarcinomas. MNU is an
alkylating agent that does not require metabolic bioactiva-
tion to exert its carcinogenic effects [25]. Following the in
vitro  studies, the chemopreventive effects of auraptene
were assessed in the MNU-induced rat mammary carcino-
genesis model and the expression of cyclin D1 in mam-
mary tumors was analyzed by western blot. Since
auraptene is intended to be part of the diet, the auraptene
concentration in the mammary glands was measured. In
addition, auraptene concentration in mammary tumors
and livers of the rats were also measured.
Methods
Chemicals
Auraptene was purchased from LKT Laboratories Inc., (St.
Paul, MN). The powdered diet (Teklad- 7001, 4% mouse/
rat diet) was obtained from Harlan Teklad, (Madison,
WI). MNU (N1517) was purchased from Sigma, (St.
Louis, MO). The O.C.T. compound (#4583) was obtained
from Tissue-Tek, (Torrance, CA).
Cell Proliferation Assay
The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 was
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in a ster-
ile humidified environment at 37°C and 5% CO2: 95%
air with complete DMEM media. The proliferation study
was done by MTT assay which uses a tetrazolium com-
pound [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-
zolium bromide; MTT], which is converted into a
formazan product by living cells. The MDA-MB-231 cells
were plated in a 96 well plate at 12,500 cells/well at a con-
fluency of 40%. The serum containing media was replaced
with serum free media 5 hrs before treatment. The cells
were then treated with auraptene at 1 – 50 μM auraptene
in DMSO (0.1%, v/v). The control cells received vehicle
only (DMSO, 0.1% v/v). After 24 hrs of treatment the cells
were treated with MTT for 2 h and the absorbance was
measured at 540 nm.
The human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 was
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in a ster-
ile humidified environment at 37°C and 5% CO2: 95%
air with complete DMEM media. The MCF-7 cells were
plated in a 96 well plate at 30,000 cells/well at a conflu-
ency of 40%. The cells were serum starved for 24 h. At 22BMC Cancer 2009, 9:259 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/9/259

h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with
auraptene at 1 – 50 μM auraptene in DMSO (0.1%, v/v).
The control cells received vehicle only (DMSO, 0.1% v/v).
At 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with
IGF-1(10 ng/mL). After 24 hrs of IGF-1 treatment, the
cells were treated with MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
5-(3-carboxy methoxy phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-
tetrazolium], for 2 h and the absorbance was measured at
490 nm.
Animals
A total of 128 female Sprague-Dawley rats (28 days of
age), purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI), were
used for this experiment. They were housed two per cage,
in a temperature and humidity controlled AAALAC facility
under 12 h light/dark cycle. All procedures were approved
by LSUHSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee in accordance with NIH guidelines. They were fed test
diets as described below and allowed access to food and
water ad libitum.
Treatment of rats
Rats (28 days of age) were divided up randomly into
groups of 24–26 each and were handled daily to get them
accustomed to human touch. At 42 days of age the rats
were shifted to the test diet. Control group and MNU only
group were fed with Teklad (powdered diet) only. MNU/
Auraptene 200 ppm group and MNU/Auraptene 500 ppm
group received 200 ppm and 500 ppm of auraptene
respectively, mixed in the diet for the duration of the
study. The doses were selected from the pilot study con-
ducted with a small number of animals. In addition to the
200 ppm dose of auraptene, which indicated the chemo-
preventive effect of auraptene, a higher dose of auraptene
at 500 ppm was added to this study to see any increased
chemopreventive effects. Auraptene has been adminis-
tered in diet at 100 ppm and 500 ppm in other models of
cancer [6,9,13]. The diet was prepared once a week and
stored in cold room. The food was replaced on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday or as needed. The stability of
auraptene was tested by HPLC analysis and the results
showed that auraptene was not degraded in the animal
room conditions (data not shown). At 50 days of age all
the groups except the control group received intraperito-
neal MNU injection (50 mg/kg bw in sterile acidified
saline). The control group received vehicle only. The
scheme is shown in Figure 1. The rats were palpated for
tumors twice a week starting at 2 weeks after MNU admin-
istration. Any tumors felt during palpation were recorded
by location. The rats were weighed once a week. A diet
consumption analysis was done once to see if rats were
consuming enough feed across all the groups and there
was no significant difference in food consumption
between the groups (data not shown). Any rats found to
be moribund during the study were sacrificed within 24 h
and necropsied. At 18 weeks after MNU administration,
rats were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and
necropsied. The tumor location and weight of the tumor
were marked in the necropsy sheet. Mammary fat pads
and the tumors were collected in formalin, OCT com-
pound and liquid nitrogen.
Tissue Extraction and HPLC-Fluorescence analysis
The concentration of auraptene was measured in mam-
mary glands, livers and tumors of rats. The specimens
from the animals were weighed and minced on a glass
plate kept on ice. The minced sample was added to 0.05
M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 M sucrose in 1 ml.
To 1 ml of this homogenized sample, 80 μL of 100 μM
curcumin was added as internal standard followed by vor-
texing. The sample was then extracted twice with ethyl ace-
tate: acetone (2:1 v/v). The combined supernatant was
then dried under N2 gas, resuspended in 1 mL 70% meth-
anol/H2O and analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu, SIL-10AF)
with UV (254 nm) and fluorescence detection (Shimadzu,
RF-535) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 329
nm and 390 nm respectively. The flow rate in HPLC was 1
ml/min with C18*5μ column. The mobile phase started
with 80% methanol in water up to 20 minutes and was
increased in a linear gradient up to 100% methanol over
the next 5 minutes. Under these conditions, auraptene
eluted at 14 minutes and curcumin at 6 minutes. The ratio
of area under the curve for auraptene at different concen-
trations to that of curcumin was plotted to make the
standard curve. The concentration of auraptene in the
specimens was calculated from the standard curve. For the
calculation of concentration, 1 gm of the tissue was
assumed to occupy a volume of 1 ml.
Histopathology
The tumors were histopathologically analyzed to confirm
the malignancy of the tumors palpated during the study.
For the histopathological analysis, 4 μm thick sections
were cut and then rehydrated by xylene and graded etha-

nol. The specimens were then stained with Haematoxylin
and Eosin. The H&E stained specimens were examined by
a pathologist to histopathologically classify the tumors as
described by Russo J et al[26]. The tumors were broadly
classified into two- adenocarcinoma (malignant) and
benign tumors. The benign epithelial neoplasms in this
animal model include papillary, tubular and lactating
adenoma. The malignant epithelial neoplasms include
ductal carcinoma (invasive and non-invasive) with cribri-
form, comedo, solid and papillary pattern. These benign
and malignant tumors in the rats have corresponding
human lesions [26].
Western blot analysis
MCF-7 cells
To study the effect of auraptene on the expression on cyc-
lin D1, MCF-7 cells were plated in eight 12-well plates at
1.5 × 104 cells/well. The cells were incubated at 37°C till
the next day in media with serum. The cells were serum
starved for synchronization in serum free media for the
next 24 h. At 22 h of serum starvation, the cells except in
DMSO only and IGF-1 only groups, were treated with 10
μM auraptene in DMSO. At 24 h of serum starvation, the
cells except in DMSO group were treated with 10 ng/mL
of IGF-1. The cells were harvested at 5,15 and 30 minutes
and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h after IGF-1 treatment by
directly adding boiling Laemmeli buffer. The cyclin D1
expression was then analyzed by western blot. In short,
equal volumes (15 μL) of the sample in Laemmeli buffer
was loaded into each well and resolved. The separated
proteins were then electroblotted on a 0.45 μm pore size
PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica,
MA). After the protein transfer the membrane was placed
in Millipore SNAP id Protein Detection System. The mem-
branes were blocked in 0.5% milk in TBS-T buffer by
pouring the blocking buffer through the system connected
to vacuum. Primary incubation of the membranes was
carried out using 1:500 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-
cyclin D1 antibody (#2922; Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA). Secondary incubation of the membrane
was then carried out by using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-
rabbit antibody. The bands were developed by detection
using Pierce ECL western blot substrate kit (# 32209;
Pierce, Rockford, IL). The blots were scanned using the
Epson system (# 1650; Epson America, Long Beach, CA).
The band intensity was evaluated using the Image-J soft-
ware. The cyclin D1 expression was normalized to β-actin.
Rat mammary tumors
The mammary tumors from the female Sprague-Dawley
rats were analyzed for cyclin D1 expression and eukaryotic
Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) as previously described [27].
Briefly, samples were first homogenized in RIPA buffer
[50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 1% Triton-X, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF,
1  μg of aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin and 1 mM
sodium fluoride]. The proteins were measured by Brad-
ford method [28] (using BSA as a standard), followed by
the addition of 2 × sample buffer [0.125 M Tris, 10% (w/
v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.04% (w/v) bromophenol
blue, and 80 mM dithiothreitol]. Samples were heated to
95°C for 5 min, and 10 μg of protein/well was loaded and
resolved. The proteins were then transferred and detected
for cyclin D1 expression as mentioned above. Lysate from
MCF-7 cells treated with IGF-1 was used as positive con-
trol for cyclin D1.
Statistical Methods
The rat body weight data was compared between groups
by One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey test. Groups were
compared for the total number of tumors per rat by the
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Time to tumor was
estimated and compared among groups using survival
curve analysis by the Log-rank test. The Cochran-Armitage
test was used to test for trends in binomial response to dif-
ferent dose levels. Analysis was performed using StatXact
(Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge MA) and SPSS
(SPSS Inc., Chicago IL). The cell proliferation assays and
western blot data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Tukey test.
Results
Auraptene suppressed human breast cancer cell 
proliferation
The effects of auraptene on proliferation were evaluated in
the human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7. Proliferation was studied by measuring the forma-
tion of formazan product by living cells. Auraptene sup-
pressed MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by 50% at 12 μM
and up to 85% at 25 μM (Figure 2-a). Increasing the con-
centration of auraptene to 50 μM did not achieve any
higher suppression of cell proliferation. The effect was sig-
nificant from 10 μM (p < 0.05). There was a reduction in
the proliferation by about 23% at a concentration of 10
μM with no further change below 5 μM. The effect of
auraptene on MCF-7 cells was not as prominent as in
MDA-MB-231 cells. However, auraptene significantly
reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation from 20–50 μM (p <
0.05). Auraptene suppressed MCF-7 cell proliferation by
26% at 20 μM and up to 49% at 50 μM (Figure 2-b). Based
on the effects of auraptene on these human breast cancer
cells, and on its previously demonstrated chemopreven-
tive effects in other in vivo models, we hypothesized that
auraptene would suppress MNU-induced rat mammary
carcinogenesis.
Auraptene reduced cyclin D1 expression in MCF-7 cells
Treatment of serum starved MCF-7 cells with IGF-1
induced a time-dependent increase in cyclin D1 expres-
sion which peaked at 8 h after IGF-1 addition to theBMC Cancer 2009, 9:259 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/9/259

medium. At 24 h after IGF-1 treatment, cyclin D1 expres-
sion was similar to that of control cells. Western blot anal-
ysis of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells in culture
showed that 2 h pretreatment of auraptene (10 μM)
resulted in nearly a total loss of IGF-1 induced cyclin D1
expression at 8 h (Figure 2-c).
Dietary auraptene did not affect rat body weight
Rat body weight was used as a gross indication of health
and/or toxicity. After 2 weeks of MNU administration, the
weight of the MNU treated rats was significantly lower
than that of the control rats (Figure 3-a). This was
observed until the end of the study. However, there was
no significant difference in body weight between the
groups treated with MNU (p < 0.05). Thus auraptene did
not significantly affect body weight.
Effects of auraptene on tumor incidence
In Figure 3-b, the percentage of tumor incidence (percent-
age of rats with tumor) in each group is shown. There were
no palpable tumors in the control rats. The first palpable
tumor in the MNU only group was seen at 28 days after
MNU injection. In the MNU/Auraptene 200 ppm group,
the first palpable tumor was seen at 38 days while it was
seen at 49 days for MNU/Auraptene 500 ppm group after
MNU injection, respectively. The effect of auraptene 500
ppm became evident after 77 days of MNU treatment. The
tumor palpation data was analyzed every week to deter-
mine if auraptene had any effect on the tumor incidence.
At 16 weeks, the maximum inhibitory effect of auraptene
was observed (Figure 3-b and Table 1) where auraptene
(500 ppm) significantly suppressed tumor incidence by
46%. Towards the end of the study the incidence in the

MNU only group and the MNU/Auraptene 200 ppm
group was 81% while that in MNU/Auraptene 500 ppm
group was 67%. Thus, auraptene attenuated tumor inci-
dence. The Cochran-Armitage trend test for binomial data
showed that overall as the dose of auraptene was
increased to 500 ppm there was a significant decrease in
tumor incidence (p < 0.05).
Effects of dietary auraptene on tumor multiplicity and 
tumor burden
Next, we analyzed the effects of auraptene on tumor mul-
tiplicity (average number of tumors per rat). At 16 weeks,
auraptene (500 ppm) significantly inhibited tumor multi-
plicity by 37% (Table 1). At the end of the study the aver-
age number of palpable tumors per rat in MNU only
group was 2.5, while it was 2.08 in the MNU/Auraptene
200 group and 2.0 in the MNU/Auraptene 500 group (Fig-
ure 3-c). These results were not found to be significant.
However, the total numbers of tumors were found to be
significantly reduced in the MNU/Auraptene 500 group
animals that had only 48 tumors when compared to MNU
only group (p < 0.05) which had 65 tumors. The tumor
burden (total tumor weights per rat and average tumor
weight per rat in grams) was 6.62 ± 1.93 and 2.36 ± 0.77
in the MNU control; 6.52 ± 1.49 and 2.94 ± 0.79 in the
MNU/Auraptene 200 ppm group; and 6.50 ± 2.10 and
1.79 ± 0.54 in the MNU/Auraptene 500 ppm group,
respectively. These values were not significantly different
from each other hence auraptene offered no significant
protection in tumor burden at necropsy.
Dietary auraptene delayed median time to tumor
Median time to tumor is the time taken for the develop-
ment of tumor in 50% of animals. The median time to
tumor was found to be significantly delayed in the
auraptene treated animals compared to MNU only group
animals (Figure 4, log-rank test, p = 0.024). At the highest
dose in this study (500 ppm) the median time to tumor
was 119 days while that for the MNU only group (MNU)
only treated group, it was 80 days (Table 1). Therefore, the
delay in the 500 ppm group was 39 days (about 6 weeks).
Thus auraptene significantly delayed the median time to
tumor in the 500 ppm group. In the case of 200 ppm
group the median time to tumor was 91 days and the
delay was 11 days compared to the MNU group.
Histopathology of mammary tumors
The H&E stained sections of the samples from this tumor
study were analyzed for histopathology. Most tumors
from the MNU treated groups were malignant adenocarci-
noma of different types such as papillary, cribriform and
comedo carcinoma. A few benign epithelial neoplasms
such as lactating adenoma (adenomas with milk like sub-
stance in the lumen) and papillary adenoma were
observed, in addition to the malignant tumors. In the
Control group a papillary carcinoma was observed in the
mammary fat pad on only one rat. This tumor was not
found during palpation and necropsy. Some of the nor-
mal adjacent mammary glands in animals from all the
groups showed exfoliation and/or mild hyperplasia.
Overall, the histopathology of the tumor was consistent in
all the MNU received animals irrespective of auraptene
treatment; that is, in all groups most of the tumors were
adenocarcinomas.
Dietary auraptene suppressed cyclin D1 expression in rat 
mammary tumors
Based on the effect of auraptene on the expression of cyc-
lin D1 expression in MCF-7 cells, the tumors from the rats
were analyzed for cyclin D1 expression. Western blot anal-
ysis of rat mammary tumors (n = 10 per group) confirmed
that auraptene (500 ppm) significantly reduced (p < 0.05)
cyclin D1 expression by 49% compared to the MNU only
group (Figure 5). The effect of 500 ppm dose was also sig-
nificantly different than the 200 ppm dose of auraptene,
indicating a dose-response. We also observed that MNU
increased eIF4E protein expression in the tumors com-
pared to control mammary gland. Although cyclin D1 is

pathways [27], there was no significant change in the
eIF4E protein expression by auraptene (data not shown).
HPLC analysis of auraptene in tissue
Since the ideal chemopreventive agent should be bioavail-
able after oral administration we tested whether
auraptene reached the target tissue, the mammary glands.
HPLC analysis with fluorescence detection indeed indi-
cated that auraptene was reaching the mammary glands at
both the doses of 200 and 500 ppm. Analysis of rat mam-
mary glands indicated an average concentration of 1.4 ±
0.5 μM and 1.8 ± 0.3 μM for the auraptene 200 and 500
ppm groups respectively (means ± S.E.) (Figure 6). In
addition to the mammary glands we analyzed the livers
and mammary tumors for the presence of auraptene.
Analysis of rat livers from auraptene 500 ppm group indi-
cated an average concentration of 0.87 (mean, n = 2). The
average concentration in mammary tumors from
auraptene 200 ppm was 0.31 ± 0.98 μM (means ± S.E.).
The tumors in the 500 ppm group were not available for
analysis of auraptene concentration, as they were used in
the western blot analysis of cyclin D1.
Discussion
The current study was conducted to examine the effects of
the citrus compound auraptene in the chemoprevention
of breast cancer. Current prevention methods against
breast cancer are limited by the number of compounds
and their side effects. This warrants the need for new che-
mopreventive compounds against breast cancer. Even
though auraptene has been shown to possess chemopre-
ventive effects in many cancer models there is no data
available regarding its effects on breast cancer, which is a
major health threat to women. Overall, the results of the
current study have demonstrated that citrus auraptene
suppressed human breast carcinoma proliferation and
IGF-1 induced protein expression of cyclin D1 in vitro.
Furthermore, auraptene in the diet suppressed MNU-
induced tumor incidence, number of tumors and signifi-
cantly delayed median time to tumor in rats. Consistent
with the cell culture results, auraptene also significantly

decreased cyclin D1 in the rat mammary tumors. In che-
mopreventive studies the median time to tumor is a rele-
vant parameter because it indicates the ability of a
compound to prolong the onset of carcinogenesis.
Although auraptene at 500 ppm was found to be signifi-
cant at 16 weeks after tumor MNU treatment in inhibiting
tumor incidence and multiplicity, towards the end of the
study both these effects were found to be not significant.
This shows that auraptene's effect was mainly on delaying
the onset of tumors rather than inhibiting the tumor for-
mation at the highest dose in this study. In the future,
analysis of rat tumors at different time points will give us
more information regarding this effect. The effects of
doses of auraptene higher than 500 ppm will also be
worthwhile to study.
Chemoprevention of cancer requires a long-term admin-
istration of the compound through diet/oral administra-
tion. It is therefore required that the compound possesses
little to no toxicity. Overall, auraptene was well tolerated
by rats in the mammary carcinogenesis model as there was
no observable change in the gross behavior of the rats and
no significant weight loss among the rats treated with
MNU ± auraptene compared to rats treated with MNU
alone. Previous studies of auraptene have also not shown
any toxic effect of this compound after dietary administra-
tion [13]. We have previously used auraptene in mice at
up to 150–200 mg/kg bw [29] (and data not shown). In
this study, our highest dose, 500 ppm of auraptene, corre-
sponds to 10 mg of daily dose for 20 gm of average daily
consumption of food by adult female rats. The average
weight of the rats was around 250 gm and so they received
approximately 40 mg/kg of auraptene per day in the 500
ppm group which much less than the safety limit.
As stated above, the basic idea behind chemoprevention
of cancer with natural products is the administration of
the natural compound in diet everyday. For an orally
administered drug, bioavailability is an important factor,
which contributes to its efficacy. Poor oral bioavailability
can make natural compounds that are found to be effec-
tive in preventing carcinogenesis in some cancer models
ineffective against carcinogenesis of internal organs.
Quercetin is an example, which was found to be effective
against colon carcinogenesis but was found to be ineffec-
tive in mammary carcinogenesis [25]. Coumarins are rap-
idly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely
distributed [22]. Other coumarins like imperatorin, iso-
imperatorin and isopimpinellin have also been shown to
be orally bioavailable [15,23,24,30]. Auraptene was
detected in mammary glands, livers and tumors, suggest-
ing that it is absorbed and distributed to the target organ.
An article was recently published on the concentrations of
auraptene in male Sprague-Dawley rats following oral
administration [30]. From 1–4 h following gavage admin-
istration (500 μmol/kg bw, p.o.), auraptene was found in
high concentrations in stomach and intestine (up to
~2000 nmol/g stomach, 100 nmol/g small intestine, and
20 nmol/g large intestine) [30]. Hepatic concentrations of
auraptene reached up to ~25 μm within 1–4 h of oral
administration, then dropped rapidly [30]. In our study,
rats were fed the auraptene diet ad libitum, and were sac-
rificed during the day. Since rodents are typically noctur-
nal, we believe the reason the hepatic concentrations were
lower in our study than in the Kuki et al study is because
of the time differences. Furthermore, evidence suggests
that glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites were found
in serum and urine [30]. Taken together, these results sug-
gest that auraptene possesses wide oral bioavailability.
The suppressive effects of auraptene on cyclin D1 expres-
sion were intriguing. Many oncogenic pathways can
upregulate cyclin D1 and other proliferative, anti-apop-
totic, metastatic and/or angiogenic proteins. A previous
report demonstrated that in HT-29 human colorectal can-
cer cells in culture, auraptene (25 μM) suppressed the
expression of c-Myc (which is often induced along with
other pro-oncogenic proteins) [18]. The two major mech-
anisms for this effect were suppression of phosphor-
ylated-ERK1/2 and eIF4B. The effect on c-Myc was at the

translational level, as the levels of mRNA were
unchanged, but the protein levels were decreased.
Whether auraptene acts on ERK1/2 or eIF4B in the rat
mammary model remains to be determined. However,
our results suggest that auraptene may reduce cell prolif-
eration through the suppression of cyclin D1 in MCF-7
cells and in the rat mammary tumors. Further experiments
such as flow cytometry will be done to understand the
effect on cyclin D1 on cell cycle arrest as reduction in cell
proliferation may not be a direct effect of the suppression
of cyclin D1 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of auraptene suppression of cyclin D1 protein
expression in vivo. In a recent study in a Tissue Micro Array
(TMA) format, we have shown that cyclin D1 protein is
over expressed in the local breast cancer patients [27].
Thus suppression of cyclin D1 expression could play a
major role in breast cancer prevention in the future.
In previous studies in other cancer models, auraptene has
been shown to inhibit ODC [13,20], induce Phase-II
enzymes including glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and
quinone reductase (QR) [6], and suppress matrix metallo-
proteinases (MMPs) [19]. In vitro, auraptene also reduces
superoxide generation in differentiated promyelocytic
HL-60 cells [3], activates apoptotic pathways in Jurkat-T
cells [4], suppresses MMPs in human colorectal adenocar-
cinoma cell line, HT-29 [18] and inhibits the expression
of inducible nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2 in murine
macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 [17,31]. Our research
group reported that auraptene increased the activation of
the antioxidant response element (ARE) in HepG2-ARE-
GFP cells. Furthermore, the ability of orally administered
auraptene (and other naturally occurring coumarins) to
induce hepatic GST activities was significantly attenuated
in Nrf2(-/-) mice [32]. This suggests that auraptene
induces Phase II enzymes such as GST through an Nrf-2/
ARE mechanism. Thus, auraptene does possess multiple
mechanisms of chemoprevention.
In summary, dietary auraptene delayed MNU-induced
median time to tumor and significantly suppressed cyclin
D1 expression in the rat mammary tumors. The suppres-
sion of cyclin D1 was dose-dependent, with greater sup-
pression at the higher dose of auraptene. This dose-
dependent effect is consistent with that of the tumor
latency. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo results both suggest
that auraptene was effective in delaying the progression of
tumor possibly through suppression of cyclin D1 protein
expression.

by HPLC (Shimadzu, SIL-10AF) with UV (254 nm) and fluorescence detection (Shimadzu, RF-535) at excitation and emission 
wavelengths of 329 nm and 390 nm respectively.BMC Cancer 2009, 9:259 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/9/259

Conclusion
Overall, this study shows that auraptene significantly
delayed the time to tumor and suppressed cyclin D1
which is a cell cycle protein that has been shown to play a
major role in breast cancer. Auraptene reached its target
organ, mammary glands, after dietary administration. The
low/no toxicity of auraptene, its bioavailability in mam-
mary glands after dietary administration and its chemo-
preventive effects makes auraptene an ideal compound to
be further studied for clinical use. Further research needs
to be done to understand its effects at different time points
of cancer progression at higher doses. We are further stud-
ying the mechanism of regulation of cyclin D1 by
auraptene and its downstream effects in human breast
cancer cell lines.
