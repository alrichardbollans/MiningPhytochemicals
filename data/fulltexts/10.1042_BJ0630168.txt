from Agave americana L.

The cuticle is a layer covering the epidermis of
the exposed parts of plants (e.g. stems, leaves).
In spite of very wide occurrence, the chemical
composition of plant cuticular layer is practically
unknown (cf. Zetsche, 1932). Lee (1925) found that
the cuticles of chrysanthemum and rose petals and
the petioles of rhubarb leaves consisted of fatty
acids, both free and esterified, soaps of fatty acids
and some free higher alcohols, resinous substances
and tannins. Triterpenoids, such as ursolic acid,
were also reported in the cuticular layer of some
300 Japanese plants (Kariyine & Hashimoto, 1953;
cf. Huelin & Gallop, 1951). On extraction of the
cuticle of Agave americana and Agave rigida (Legg
& Wheeler, 1925, 1929) successively with different
solvents, several classes of compounds were ob-
tained, namely glycosides of the saponin type, free
acids, saponifiable material and cellulose. The
residue remaining after these extractions was
defined as cutin and was considered to be the
characteristic part of the cuticular layer. The cutin
was further resolved, after saponification with
ethanolic potassium hydroxide, by a method
based on the different solubilities of individual
metal salts in various solvents. Four acids were
isolated: a semi-liquid acid, C26H50O, (65% of
cutin); a semi-liquid acid, C,3H2203 (10%); an acid
melting at 107-108° (10 %), thought to be identical
with phloionic acid found in suberin, and an acid
melting at 88-90° (very small amount). By similar
methods, the isolation of only two acids from cutin
of an agave had been reported previously (Fremy,
1859, 1881, 1885): a solid acid, named stearo-cutic,
m.p. 760, and a semi-liquid acid, named oleo-cutic.
Their relative proportion in the cutin was 1: 5
respectively. No attempts have been made to
elucidate the structures of any of these acids.
This paper is concerned with the separation,
isolation and structure of the acids constituting the
ether-soluble fraction obtained on saponification of
cutin from A. americana L. This fraction represents
some 60% of the weight of cutin.
METHODS
Countercurrent distribution. Countercurrent-distribution
experiments were performed in a 24-tube stainless-steel
apparatus of 6-8 ml./phase capacity or in an all-glass model
of 100 ml./phase capacity (Craig & Craig, 1950).
Sixty transfers were applied in the all-glass apparatus,
with a single-withdrawal technique. The thirty emerging
upper phases were then recycled over thirty fresh lower
phases. The solvent system consisted of mutually saturated
chloroform-methanol-isohexane-water (10: 10:5: 4, by
vol.).
The distribution in the stainless-steel apparatus was
followed by titration to phenolphthalein of the contents of
each tube with ethanolic 0-05N-NaOH. Portions (5 ml.)
from each phase in each tube were collected from the all-
glass apparatus; after drying in a vacuum oven the residues
were weighed.
The volume of NaOH used or the weight of the residue
was plotted against the tube number.
Analytical-scale reversed-phase partition chromatography.
For these chromatographic experiments a water-jacketed
column (0.8 cm. x 80 cm.) was used. The temperature was
that of running tap water (18-20°), and small variations
did not affect the separations. The eluate was collected in
a siphon delivering 1 ml. portions and titrated in a glass
vessel as described by Howard & Martin (1950) with 0-01 N
methanolic NaOH, bromothymol blue being used as indi-
cator (0-2%, w/v, in 70% aqueous acetone). N2 from a
cylinder was used to agitate the eluate, and it was found
unnecessary to protect it against atmospheric CO2. On
plotting the volume of alkali used against the aliquot
number, chromatographic curves were obtained.
Three different stationary phases were used: (i) purified
medicinal paraffin (Howard & Martin, 1950); (ii) purified
castor oil (Savary & Desnuelle, 1953) and (iii) a paraffin-
castor oil mixture (50%, w/w). The stationary phases were
adsorbed on non-wetting kieselguhr and packed as de-
scribed by Silk & Hahn (1954a).
Different water-acetone (v/v) mixtures equilibrated
with the appropriate stationary phase and clarified by
filtration were used as developing solvents.
The material (5-30 mg.) was dissolved in ether and 1 g. of
non-wetting kieselguhr containing the stationary phase
was added. The ether was slowly evaporated with constant
stirring. The powdery mull was suspended in 10 ml. of the
mixture having the lowest acetone content that was used in
the experiment and bedded by means of a plunger with a
perforated disk.
Preparative reversed-phase partition chromatography. It
became necessary to extend the reversed-phase partition
chromatography in such a way that it could be used as a
preparative tool. A column (3.9 cm. x 1-2 m.) was used in
conjunction with a siphon of special construction. The
siphon (cf. Silk & Hahn, 1954b) divided each fraction into
two portions: (i) the bulk (30 ml.), which was collected;
(ii) a small sample (2 ml.), which was titrated and dis-
carded. It was thus possible to follow the development of
the chromatogram without contaminating the material

recovered. When 280g. ofnon-wetting kieselguhrwith 225g.
of castor oil was used, it was found that as much as 18 g. of
materialcould be processed at oncewithout adverselyaffect-
ingthe resolution.The mullwas prepared inthe usualwayand
packed in the column as a slurry with the aid of a plunger.
Determination of the position of the secondary hydroxyl
group. The following micro method was developed for the
detection of the position of the secondary hydroxyl group
in molecules of the type
CH2(OH) [CH2]2,.CH(OH) [CH2], * CO2H.
The methyl ester of the acid, dissolved in acetic acid,
was shaken in a stoppered flask with the calculated amount
of CrO3 for 18 hr. at 300. Under these conditions very little
or no hydrolysis occurred. The reaction mixture was
poured into water and worked up in ether. The product
obtained on distillation of the solvent was extracted with
pentane to remove the half-ester of dicarboxylic acids
formed and to leave free dicarboxylic acids as a residue.
Part of the half-ester extract was then saponified. In this
way three fractions were obtained: (a) pentane-insoluble
(dicarboxylic acids); (b) pentane-soluble (half-esters) and
(c) pentane-soluble saponified fraction (saponified half
esters) (these will be referred to as fractions a, b and c in the
experimental part). All three fractions and a synthetic
mixture of adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic and sebacic
acids were spotted on a sheet of Whatman no. 1 paper and
developed with a mixture of n-propanol-conc. aqueous
NH3 (60:40, v/v) (Isherwood & Hanes, 1953) by descending
chromatography at approx. 200. When the solvent front had
moved about 25 cm. the paper was removed from the
tank, dried for 1 hr. at room temperature and sprayed with
bromocresol-green indicator prepared according to Lind-
quist & Storgards (1953).
The longest-chain acid detected from the saponified
half-ester fraction gave the distance of the hydroxyl group
from the original carboxyl side and the longest-chain acid
detected in the dicarboxylic acid fraction gave the position
of the hydroxyl relative to the opposite side of the chain,
as shown below:
CH2(OH) . [CH2],.CH(OH) . [CH2]V,COCMe

+ and +
(2) H02C. [CH2],-1. C02Me HO2C. [CH2]_1.C0,H (4)
The dicarboxylic acids detected must give the original
chain length when the appropriate oxidation fragments are
added (e.g. 1 + 2 or 3 +4), thus providing a check of the
results. The half-esters all have Rp values of about 0.9,
which is much higher than those of the dicarboxylic acids.
twice with boiling hexane (2 x 21.) for 3 hr. The hexane
solutions were combined and gave 24 g. of yellow wax.
The cuticle was refluxed with 21. of ethanol for 3 hr. and
the solvent decanted while hot. This treatment was re-
peated eight times. The combined ethanolic solutions gave
a further 54 g. of waxy material. The total wax fraction
was thus 78 g. (24-1 %).
The cuticle was extracted with 61. of boiling water for
2 hr. and the water decanted while hot. After four treat-
ments the water was no longer coloured. The extraction was
continued in an autoclave under a pressure of 17 lb./sq. in.
until a 100 ml. portion left no residue on evaporation. The
combined water extracts were worked up to give 27 g.
(8-2%) of dark-brown, crisp material.
Cellulose was removed by treatment with Schweizer
reagent. The cuticle, suspended in 21. of cuprammonium
hydroxide solution, was shaken for 8 hr. and filtered.
After three extractions all cellulose was removed, since the
test with 'chlor-zinc-iodide' reagent (Abderhalden, 1914)
on sections of the residual material showed no blue
coloration.
The residue, which was defined as cutin, was washed
with 41. of 10% hydrochloric acid and hot water until
neutral. After air-drying, 168 g. (51 %) of light-brown
elastic tissue was obtained. (Found: ash, 4-2; C, 63-9;
H, 9.6%, ash-free basis.)
Saponification of cutin and preliminary
fractionation of the derived acid8
Saponification of cutin with ethanolic KOH (5%, w/v),
sodium ethoxide or boiling Cellosolve-KOH (5%, wfv) was
found unsatisfactory, and the method described below was
used in the present work.
Finely ground cutin (30 g.) and 5% aqueous KOH
(200 ml.) were placed in a rotating 500 ml. autoclave and
heated for 17 hr. at 1300. The reaction mixture was filtered
hot through a Gooch crucible; the residue was boiled twice
with water and filtered off. After drying at 1000, 3.59 g. of
a brown powder was obtained. (Found: ash, 10-5; C, 52-6;
H, 7.8%, ash-free basis.)
The combined filtrates were extracted with ether but no
unsaponifiable material was found.
After acidification with 5% HCI, the precipitated acids
were filtered off and repeatedly extracted with ether. The
ether-insoluble residue gave, after drying, 4-14 g. of brown
powder. (Found: C, 70 3; H, 11-9%; equiv. wt., 470.) The
aqueous filtrate was extracted several times with ether and
the ethereal solutions were combined with those obtained
previously. After distillation of the solvent, 17-23 g. of
brown greasy material remained. (Found: equiv. wt., 332.)
The fractionation is shown schematically in Fig. 1.
EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS
Melting points were determined in capillary tubes immersed
in an electrically heated and stirred paraffin bath and are
corrected. Infrared absorption spectra were recorded with
a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrometer Model 21.
Isolation of cutin
Leaves of A. americana L. were collected near Pretoria
and, after washing, the cuticle was stripped off. A method
based on that of Legg & Wheeler (1925) was used for the
isolation of cutin. Air-dried cuticle (329 g.) was extracted

Reduction of the ether-soluble fraction
to the parent acidls
The ether-soluble fraction (2 g.), HI (sp.gr. 1-7; 30 ml.)
and red P (0.3 g.) were refluxed for 8 hr. with continuous
stirring. The reaction mixture was poured into water and
extracted with ether. The ethereal solution was washed with
water, 5% NaHSO3 and water, and dried and distilled,
leaving a brown oil (3.21 g.). The oil was dissolved in
methanol (30 ml.) and refluxed for 4 hr. in the presence of
Zn (2 g.) and conc. HCl (15 ml.). The reaction mixture was
diluted with water and worked up in ether to give a yellow
solid (1.94 g.), which was chromatographed on a column of
neutral alumina (40 g.). Three fractions were collected from
the chromatogram: (i) pentane-eluted material (0.67 g.);
(ii) pentane-ether (1:1, v/v)-eluted material (0.66 g.); and
(iii) ether-eluted material (0-13 g.).
Fraction (i) was saponified and some of the acids obtained
were subjected to reversed-phase partition chromatography
with paraffin as a stationaryphase. Two well-resolved peaks
were obtained and indentified as palmitic and stearic acids
by a mixed chromatogram with authentic samples.
Fraction (ii) contained, in addition to a small amount of
palmitic and stearic acids, some incompletely reduced
material which appeared with the solvent front. This
fraction (0-6 g.) was therefore treated again with HI as
described above. After purification on an alumina column,
the pentane eluate (0.3 g.) consisted again only of palmitic
and stearic acids.
The ratio of palmitic to stearic acid in the total ether-
soluble fraction was approximately 1: 3.
Separation of the acids constituting
the ether-soluble fraction
Countercurrent-distribution experiments. The ether-
soluble fraction was only partially resolved after thirty
transfers in the all-glass apparatus, as can be seen from
Fig. 2. Two fractions designated as Z and Y in Fig. 2 were
collected, and fraction Z was worked up in ether and then
subjected to sixty transfers in the manner described pre-
viously. Some further separation was evident, but sixty
transfers were still insufficient to resolve this mixture into
well-defined peaks. This method was not used for further
resolution of the mixture. However, from fraction Y a high
concentrate of a relatively pure compound was obtained.
This material was designated as concentrate A.
The preparation of the concentrate A was simplified
further by using the multiple-batch extraction technique
(cf. Zilch, Dutton & Cowan, 1952). The ether-soluble
fraction (10 g.) was subjected to four transfers with four
separating funnels. The same solvent system was used as in
the countercurrent-distribution experiments (150 ml. of
each phase). All four upper phases were combined and
worked up to give fraction 1 (2-4 g.). The four lower phases
were combined and worked up; the material obtained was
subjected again to the process described above. The com-
bined upper phases gave fraction 2 (2-5 g.) and the com-
bined lower phases fraction 3 (4.8 g.). This fractionation is
shown in Fig. 3.
All three fractions obtained by this procedure were sub-
jected to countercurrent distribution and the curves are
reproduced in Fig. 4. Fraction 1 was practically the same
as concentrate A. Fractions 2 and 3 were very similar to
one another and were therefore combined.

Reversed-phase partition chromatography. Some of the
total ether-soluble fraction was subjected to reversed-
phase partition chromatography, with castor oil as a
stationary phase. Five peaks, designated A, B, C, D and E
respectively, were obtained as recorded in Fig. 5. In this
procedure the separation of A and B was far from com-
plete. When, however, the combined fractions 2 and 3,
obtained by the batch-extraction technique as described
above, were chromatographed on the same column, the
curve reproduced in Fig. 6 was obtained. As was expected,
the largest part of A was already removed, and therefore
the degree of separation which could be achieved between
the remaining A and B was increased.
These experiments showed that excellent separation of
cutin acids on a castor-oil column was possible. The bulk of
the material was therefore processed in the preparative
column described. Four fractions were collected from each
chromatogram as indicated in Fig. 6. From each fraction
most of the organic solvent was removed by distillation at

with ether, and after removal of the solvent four concen-
trates, designated A, B, C and D respectively, were
obtained.
9:10:18-Trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid*
(phloionolic acid)
Isolation. Fraction 1 obtained by the batch-extraction
technique was recrystallized from ethyl acetate to give the
acid (approx. 25% of cutin; approx. 43% of the ether-
soluble fraction) (needles), m.p. 102-103°, unchanged on
admixture with phloionolic acid isolated from suberin
(kindly supplied by Professor Ribas). (Found: C, 65-0;
H, 10.9%; equiv. wt., 330. Calc. for C18H3605: C, 65-0; H,
10-9%; equiv. wt., 332.)
The methyl ester was prepared by refluxing the acid in
methanol-H2SO4; it was crystallized from benzene to m.p.
800-80.4°. (Found: C, 66-1; H, 11-0; active H, 0-9
(Zerewitinoff method in anisole). Calc. for C1,H80,5:
C, 65-9; H, 11-0; active H, 0.87%.)
Reduction to the parent acid. The acid (460mg.) was
treated with HI and Zn as described above and worked up
in ether to give a solid (369 mg.) which was purified on a
neutral alumina column.
The pentane-eluted material (256 mg.), after one crystal-
lization from acetone, had m.p. 38.2-38.6°, undepresssd on
admixture with authentic methyl stearate. (Found: C,
76-6; H, 12-9. Calc. for Cl,H,8O,: C, 76-45; H, 12-8%.)
Oxidation with lead tetraacetate. The acid (5 g.) dissolved
in benzene (150 ml.) containing acetic acid (15 ml.) was
oxidized with lead tetraacetate (20 g.) in benzene (50 ml.) at
550 in the presence of air (cf. Mendel & Coops, 1939). The
reaction mixture was poured into 5% aqueous H2SO4
(100 ml.) and the aqueous layer extracted three times with
benzene. The combined benzene solutions were treated
with 50% aqueous KOH and the alkaline extracts acidified
and worked up in ether. The residue obtained was esterified
with methanol to give a mixture (4-2 g.) which was
adsorbed on a neutral alumina (50 g.) column and eluted
with (i) isohexane (350 ml.) and (ii) methanol (150 ml.).
(i) The isohexane-eluted material (2-47 g.) was an oil
which distilled at 160°/24 mm.; rj20 1-4365 (dimethyl
azelate: d?2 1-43669). (Found: C, 61-2; H, 9-3. Calo. for
CILH2004: C, 61-1; H, 9-3%.) The distillate was saponified
to give azelaic acid, m.p. and mixed m.p. 1070. (Found:
C, 57-4; H, 8-45. Calc. for C,H1604: C, 57-4; H, 8-6%.) The
dianilide had m.p. 1860. (Found: N, 8-1. Calc. for
CaiHuOsNN: N, 8-3 %.)
(ii) The methanolic eluate was concentrated in vacuo to
25 ml., diluted with water and extracted with ether.
Distillation of the solvent left an oil (1-4 g.). (Found:
active H, 0-57. (LiAlH4 method.) Calc. for C10H4003:
active H, 0-53 %.) This was saponified to give the acid,
recrystallized from ethyl acetate and water to m.p. 50-0-
50.50 (9-hydroxynonanoic acid has m.p. 51-51.50; Chuit &
Hausser, 1929). (Found: C, 62-2; H, 10-5%; equiv. wt.,
174. Calc. for C,H1L03: C, 62-0; H, 10-4%; equiv. wt., 174.)
Reduction by LiAlH4 of the products of oxidation by lead
tetraacetate. The mixture of acids (2-59 g.), obtained by
oxidation with lead tetraacetate as described above, was
dissolved in dry ether (100 ml.) and added dropwise to
LiAlH4 (1-1 g.) in ether (50 ml.). It was then refluxed for
1 hr., cooled and decomposed with 5% aqueous H2SO4

(Nylstrom & Brown, 1947). The reaction product was
worked up in ether to give a solid (1-49 g.) which distilled
at 1230/0-5 mm. without leaving any residue. After re-
crystallization from benzene the alcohol was identified as
nonane-1:9-diol, m.p. and mixed m.p. 45.2-45.6°. (Found:
C, 67-7; H, 12-5. Calc. for C9H2002: C, 67-45; H, 12.6%.)
Degradative oxidation with CrO3. The methyl ester
(100 mg.), acetic acid (1 ml.) and CrO3 (90 mg.), were
shaken for 18 hr. at 300 and worked up in ether to give a
solid (120 mg.), which was treated as described under
Methods in order to obtain the three fractions. These were
chromatographed on paper together with a mixture of
authentic dicarboxylic acids. Fraction b gave a spot with
Rp 0-86. Fractions a and c both gave a spot (Rp 0 58)identical with that given by azelaic acid. Two more very
faint spots, due to suberic acid (Rp 0 48) and azelaic half-
ester (Rp 0.86), were also detected in these fractions.
10: 16-Dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid
Isolation. The concentrate B (obtained from the pre-
parative reversed-phase partition chromatography, see
Fig. 6) was rechromatographed on a castor-oil column.
From the shape of the curve it was obvious that in addition
to a small amount of C a certain amount of A was also
present.
The concentrate B (4.7 g.), dissolved in 96% ethanol
(150 ml.), was treated with a solution of sodium para-
periodate (2 g.) in 2N-H2SO4 (50 ml.) (Karnovsky &
Rapson, 1946; cf. Jackson, 1944) in order to oxidize
phloionolic acid. After standing at room temperature for
1 hr. the reaction mixture was poured into water and
worked up in ether. The solid obtained (3 9 g.) was re-
chromatographed on a castor-oil column and the fractions
were collected in such a way that the right-hand impurity
(C) was discarded. The acetone was distilled off in vacuo and
the precipitated solid filtered off and dried over P20,. The
acid (approx. 9.7% of cutin; approx. 17% of the ether-
soluble fraction) was crystallized from aqueous methanol
to m.p. 75-76° (needles). (Found: C, 66-5; H, 10-9%;
equiv. wt., 275. Cl,3H3204 requires C, 66-6; H, 11-2%;
equiv. wt., 288.) The methyl ester, prepared in the usual
way, was crystallized from benzene to m.p. 67.5-68.3°.
(Found: C, 67-35; H, 11-5; active H, 0-67 (Zerewitinoff
method in anisole). C17H3404 requires C, 67-5; H, 11-3;
active H, 0.66%.)
Reduction to the parent acid. The acid (300 mg.) was
treated with HI and Zn as described above and worked up
in ether to give a slightly yellow oil (268 mg.) which was
purified on a neutral aluminacolumn. The pentane(150ml.)-
eluted material (218 mg.) was saponified to give palmitic
acid, m.p. and mixed m.p. 62.4-62-8°. (Found: C, 74-9;
H, 12-6. Calc. for C16H3202: C, 74 9; H, 12-6%.) A mixed
chromatogram of the acid obtained with authentic palmitic
acid gave only one peak.
Oxidation to the ketodicarboxylic acid. To the methyl ester
(49 mg.) dissolved in acetone (4 ml.) was added dropwise
a solution of CrO3 (40 mg.), water (2.5 ml.) and conc.
H2S04 (0 4 ml.) (cf. Anet, Lythgoe, Silk & Trippett, 1953).
After addition of the reagent, the mixture was stirred for
30 min. at room temperature. It was then poured into
water, extracted with ether and the ethereal solution
washed with water. After removal of the solvent the
derived solid (43 mg.) was saponified to give the acid
(42 mg.), which was crystallized from benzene to m.p.
112-.5113-5' (7-oxohexadecanedioic acid (Collaud, 1943)
has m.p. 113-113-5°). (Found: C, 64-2; H, 9-8%; equiv.
wt., 304. Calc. for C1lH280,: C, 64-0; H, 9.4%; equiv. wt.,
300.)
The position of the secondary hydroxyl group. The methyl
ester (34 mg.) in acetic acid (1 ml.) was oxidized with CrO8
(45 mg.) as described previously and worked up in ether to
give a yellow solid (32 mg.). The three fractions obtained
as described under Methods were chromatographed on
paper. Fraction b gave a spot with Rp 0-89. In the fraction
a two spots identical in RF value with those given by adipic
(Rp 0.41) and pimelic (R, 0.47) acids were detected.
Fraction c gave two spots withR,058 and 0 69 respectively,
identical with those given by azelaic and sebacic acids. In
this last fraction another spot (RP 0 76) identical with that
given by the C1* ketodicarboxylic acid was also detected.
10:18-Dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid
Isolation. The concentrate C, obtained from the pre-
parative reversed-phase partition chromatography (see
Fig. 6), was rechromatographed on a castor-oil column and
the fractions were collected in such a way that the right-
hand impurity (D) was discarded. The acetone was distilled
off in vacuo and the precipitated solid extracted with ether.
The ethereal solution was decolorized with charcoal and the
solvent distilled off. The acid obtained (approx. 10-3% of
cutin; approx. 18% of the ether-soluble fraction) was
crystallized from methanol to m.p. 84-85°. (Found: C,
68-5; H, 11-6%; equiv. wt., 298. C18H3,.04 requires C,
68-3; H, 11-5%; equiv. wt., 316.) The methyl ester, pre-
pared in the usual way, was crystallized from hexane-
benzene to m.p. 62.6-63.4°. (Found: C, 69-2; H, 11-7;
active H, 0 57 (Zerewitinoff method in anisole). C19H3804
requires C, 69-0; H, 11-6; active H, 0-61 %.)
Reduction to the parent acid. The acid (206 mg.) was
treated with HI and Zn as described above and worked up
in ether to give a slightly yellow solid (161 mg.), which was
purified on a neutral alumina column. The pentane (150 ml.) -
eluted material (132 mg.) had m.p. 37.0-37.7°, which was
raised to 37.5-38.5° on addition of methyl stearate of m.p.
38-3-38.6°. The ester was saponified to give the acid, m.p.
69.0-69.40, undepressed on admixture with authentic
stearic acid. (Found: C, 75-8; H, 12-9. Calc. for C18H3602:
C, 76-0; H, 12-8 %.) A mixed chromatogram ofthe obtained
parent acid with authentic stearic acid gave only one peak.
Oxidation to the ketodicarboxylic acid. The acid (39 mg.)
dissolved in acetone (4 ml.) was oxidized with chromic acid
in the way described above. The reaction mixture was
worked up in ether to give 10-oxo-octadecanedioic acid,
which was crystallized from benzene to m.p. 108-109°.
(Found: C, 65-6; H, 10.1 %; equiv. wt., 334. C18H3205
requires C, 65-8; H, 9-8%; equiv. wt., 328.)
The position of the secondary hydroxyl group. The methyl
ester (41 mg.) in acetic acid (1 ml.) was oxidized with
CrO3 (51 mg.) as described above and worked up in ether to
give a solid (42 mg.). The three fractions obtained as
described under Methods were chromatographed on paper.
Fraction b gave a spot with Rp 0 89. In fraction a two
spots, identical in Rp with those given by azelaic (Rp 0.62)
and suberic (Rp 0 55) acids, were detected. Fraction c gave
two spots with R, 0-62 and 0 70 identical with those given
by azelaic and sebacic acids respectively. In this last
fraction a spot (R, 0.78), due to a C18 ketodicarboxylic acid,
was also detected.

CUTIN FROM AGAVE AMERICANA L.
18-Hydroxyoctadec-cis-9-enoic acid
Isolation (as 9:10:18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid). When
the concentrate D (obtained from the preparative reversed-
phase partition chromatography, see Fig. 6) was worked up
in the usual way it was found that it contained, in addition
to the acids derived from cutin, a large amount of castor oil
washed from the column. The cutin acids were separated
from castor oil by extraction with 5% K2CO3 and, after
acidification, they were extracted with ether. The ethereal
solution was passed through a kieselguhr-silica gel (50%,
w/w) column in order to remove brown-coloured impurities.
The eluate was worked up to give a slightly coloured semi-
solid which was partly unsaturated (24-4 mg. in ethanol
took up 0-7 ml. of H2 in presence of Adams's catalyst) and
was obviously a mixture of several acids. The infrared
spectrum of the mixture (CS2 solution) was recorded and
examined in the 10-35 IA. region for trans double bonds. No
absorption peaks occurred in this region and therefore the
double bond(s) had a cis configuration.
When the mixture was subjected to reversed-phase
partition chromatography, with paraffin-castor oil (50%,
w/w) as stationary phase, only slight resolution was
achieved. As it was not possible to obtain pure acid in this
way, the mixture was dissolved in formic acid (98-100%)
and hydroxylated with performic acid at 500 (Knight, Koos
& Swern, 1954; Bergstrom & Piabo, 1954). The reaction
product was saponified, worked up in ether and chromato-
graphed on a paraffin-castor oil column. Three well-
resolved peaks were obtained and three fractions, desig-
nated D1, D2 and D3 respectively, were collected as
indicated in Fig. 7.
Although fraction D2 was made up for the greater part
of the unchanged unsaturated acid, a solid acid whose
methyl ester had m.p. 42-45° was also isolated in an impure
state from this fraction. The small amount of material
obtained precluded further purification and identification
of this acid.
Fraction D 1 was worked up in the usual way and re-
crystallized from aqueous methanol to give phloionolic
acid, m.p. 102°, undepressed on admixture with an
authentic sample. (Found: C, 64-9; H, 10-7%; equiv. wt.,
328. Calc. for Cs8H3,05: C, 65-0; H, 10-9%; equiv. wt.,
332.) The methyl ester had m.p. 79-9-80-2° (from benzene),
undepressed on admixture with methyl phloionolate.
<Found: 0, 65-9; H, 11-0. Calc. for C19H3806: C, 65-9;
H, 11.0%.)
The original unsaturated acid represents approx. 2% of
cutin (approx. 3-4% of the ether-soluble fraction).
Degradative oxidation with CrO3. The acid obtained from
-the fraction D1 (52 mg.) in acetic acid (1 ml.) was oxidized
with CrO3 (20 mg.) as described before. The reaction pro-
duct was worked up in ether and chromatographed on
paper, together with a synthetic mixture of dicarboxylic
-acids (cf. Methods). In addition to a very strong spot
(R, 0-61) corresponding to that given by azelaic acid, a
very faint spot (RF 0-82), probably due to incompletely
oxidized original material, was also detected.
18-Hydroxyoctadecanoic acid
Isolation. Fraction D3 was still a mixture, as can be
seen from the shape of the chromatographic curve in
Fig. 7. This fraction was therefore rechromatographed on
a paraffin-castor oil (50%, w/w) column, and the curve
obtained is reproduced in Fig. 8. Fraction D31 (Fig. 8)
was collected, worked up in the usual way and the yellow
solid obtained was esterified with methanol. The methyl
ester was adsorbed on a neutral alumina column and eluted
with ether. It was then crystallized from hexane to m.p.
61-.562.0o (18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid methyl ester has
m.p. 61-5-62-0°, Chuit & Hausser, 1929; 62.4-62.6°,
Bergstr6m, Aulin-Erdtman, Rolander, Stenhagen &
Ostling, 1952). (Found: C, 72-8; H, 12-0. Calc. for
C19H3803: C, 72-6; H, 12-2%.) This acid represents approx.
0-3% of cutin (approx. 0-7% of the ether-soluble fraction).
Oxidation to the dicarboxylic acid. The methyl ester
(16-6 mg.), dissolved in acetone (3 ml.), was treated with
chromic acid as described above. The oxidation product
was saponified with methanolic KOH to give the acid
(12 mg.), which was crystallized from benzene to m.p.
122-5-123-5°, undepressed on admixture with authentic
octadecanedioic acid. (Found: C, 68-9; H, 11-0. Calc. for
C18H3404: C, 68-75; H, 10-9%.)

DISCUSSION
Cutin from A. americana was obtained by a slightly
modified method of Legg & Wheeler (1925), and
then saponified in order to break down the polymer
into its constituent acids. Preliminary fractiona-
tion of the products obtained was achieved by
ether extraction. The percentage recovery of the
ether-soluble fraction varied somewhat in different
experiments, according to the efficiency of the
extraction. When small samples were used, more
than 60% of this material, based on the weight of
cutin, was obtained, but only a 50% yield resulted
from large samples. The ether-soluble fraction
therefore represented the bulk of cutin. By
reduction to palmitic and stearic acids it was shown
that this fraction consisted almost entirely of C1,
and C18 normal-chain hydroxylated acids. The
ether-soluble fraction was only partly resolved in
a 30-tube Craig apparatus. There is no apparent
reason, however, why complete separation of acids
could not be possible in an automatic apparatus
where a sufficient number of transfers could be
applied. Further resolution of the ether-soluble
fraction was achieved by means of reversed-phase
partition chromatography with castor oil or a
mixture of paraffin-castor oil (50 %, w/w) as
stationary phase. The efficiency of the castor-oil
column appeared to be at least 700 transfers, and
a very good separation of the constituent acids was
obtained. In order to prepare sufficient amounts of
pure acids for structural work, the reversed-phase
partition chromatography was extended so that it
became a preparative tool. It was found that 18 g.
of material could be processed without adversely
affecting the resolution, but this by no means
represents the upper limit of the column's loading.
The useful application of the methods described
above in the investigation of chemically related
natural products (e.g. suberin, shellac) is an obvious
possibility.
Five acids-9 :10:18 -trihydroxyoctadecanoic,
10: 18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic, 18-hydroxyoctadec-
anoic, 18-hydroxyoctadec-cia-9-enoic and 10:16-
dihydroxyhexadecanoic acids-representing more
than 80% of the ether-soluble fraction, were found
to be present. The structures of the first four acids
are suggestive of the biological path of their
formation from a common precursor. It is also
quite possible that their C16 homologues are present
in cutin in small amounts, as indicated by the
isolation of 10:16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid.
It has not been possible, however, to isolate other
C16 homologues yet.
The percentage yield of the isolated acids was
calculated from Figs. 5, 7 and 8 and it should be
considered as approximate only. The major com-
ponent (about 25% of cutin) was phloionolic acid
(thename commonly applied to 9:10 :18-trihydroxy-
octadecanoic acid, without regard to its isomeric
form) found also in small amounts in suberin
(Zetsche & Baihler, 1931; Seoane & Ribas, 1951; cf.
Jensen & Pekka, 1954). As the mixed m.p. of the
acids isolated from cutin and suberin showed no
depression, it is probable that they are identical.
The structure of phloionolic acid was confirmed by
the following series of experiments. The acid was
reduced to stearic acid to establish its carbon
skeleton. Oxidation with lead tetraacetate pro-
duced azelaic and 9-hydroxynonanoic acids. In
a parallel experiment the mixture obtained on lead
tetraacetate oxidation was reduced with lithium
aluminium hydride to give nonane-1:9-diol as a sole
product. Oxidation with chromium trioxide under
mild conditions gave only azelaic acid. By these
experiments the position of the hydroxyl groups at
C9, Clo and C18 was confirmed. In addition, it was
possible partly to elucidate the configuration of
phloionolic acid. It seems well established that
during the reaction of performic acid with the
double bond inversion occurs, so that a ci-ethylene
produces a diol with a threo configuration (e.g.
Crombie, 1952; cf. Myers, 1952). It has also been
demonstrated (Swern, Witnauer & Knight, 1952)
that the low-melting, threo-9 :10-dihydroxyocta-
decanoic acid, obtained on oxidation of oleic (ci8)
acid with performic acid, forms a urea complex,
whereas the high-melting erythro-9:10-dihydroxy-
octadecanoic acid, obtained on oxidation of oleic
acid with potassium permanganate, does not. On
treatment of 18-hydroxyoctadec-ci8-9-enoic acid
found in cutin, with performic acid, a trihydroxy
acid having threo configuration, should, therefore,
be obtained. This acid was found to be identical
with authentic phloionolic acid isolated from cutin.
Further, phloionolic acid, from both cutin and
suberin, formed a urea complex (cf. Ribas & Gil,
1951), and was the low-melting isomer (a high-
melting form, m.p. 1330, was obtained by Ribas &
Seoane (1954) by treating 18-hydroxyoctadec-cwi-
9-enoic acid with potassium permanganate; cf.
Dupont, Dulou & Cohen, 1955). On the strength of
this evidence a threw configuration is now assigned
to phloionolic acid isolated from cutin.
The structure of 10:16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic
acid was proved in the following way. Its carbon
skeleton was established by reduction to palinitic
acid. The infrared spectrum of the acid (KBr
technique) did not show any distinct CH3 band at
7 28,u., and the presence of an c-hydroxyl group
was suspected. Oxidation with chromic acid in
acetone gave an oxothapsic acid, and therefore one
of the hydroxyl groups must be attached at C18.
For the detection of the position of the remaining
hydroxyl group a micro.method was developed, as
described under Methods. Adipic, pimelic, azelaic

and sebacic acids were identified as oxidation
products, thus establishing the position of the
second hydroxyl group at C10:
(Fremy, 1859, 1881, 1885; Legg & Wheeler, 1925,
1929) were not pure compounds but mixtures, with

Similarly, 10 :18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid was
reduced to stearic acid. The infrared spectrum
(KBr technique) failed again to show conclusively
the absence of a CH3 band at 7-28 ,u., but on oxida-
tion with chromic acid in acetone an oxo-octa-
decanedioic acid was obtained to fix the position of
one hydroxyl group at 033. The position of the
second hydroxyl group was established at C10 by
oxidation to suberic, azelaic and sebacic acids:
'phloionic' acid, which was probably impure
phloionolic acid (cf. Zetsche & Bahler, 1931).
The nature of cutin itself before hydrolysis is of
considerable interest, and some relevant informa-
tion has become available as a result of the present
work. No unsaponiflable material was detected in
cutin, and all acids isolated so far from this sub-
stance after saponification have functionalities

No record of the isolation of 10:16-dihydroxy-
hexadecanoic and 10:18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic
acids has been found in the literature.
It was not possible to isolate the unsaturated
acid present in cutin in a pure state, but after
treatment with performic acid the trihydroxy acid
obtained was isolated and identified by mixed
m.p.'s of the acid and its ester as phloionolic acid.
Oxidation of the reaction product with chromium
trioxide gave only azelaic acid, thus confirming the
structure. The position of the glycol grouping
established the position ofthe original double bond,
and the absence in the infrared spectrum of a trans
band in the 10-35 Iu. region (determined on the con-
centrate of the unsaturated acid), established its
cis configuration. The original acid must therefore
have been 18-hydroxyoctadec-cis-9-enoic acid.
This acid has been recently found in suberin
(Ribas & Seoane, 1954).
The structure of 18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid,
the last acid isolated from the ether-soluble
fraction, was established by its oxidation to octa-
decanedioic acid. This acid has been now isolated
for the first time from a natural product.
In the light of the evidence presented, it is quite
clear that the cutin acids reported on previously
cutin) has one carboxyl and more than one
hydroxyl group per molecule. By inter-esterifica-
tion of such molecules cross-linked materials can be
built up, and during the reaction the carboxyl and
hydroxyl groups become linked in a random
fashion. These polymers are usually insoluble and
elastic; they swell in certain solvents and are fairly
stable thermnally. Outin possesses all these attri-
butes and is very probably a natural polyester, but
there is as yet no information about the randomness
of attachment of functional groups. The fairly
strong hydroxyl band at 2 92 i. in the infrared
spectrum of cutin (in medicinal paraffin) indicates
that some free hydroxyl groups are present in cutin
itself. This was also apparent from the examination
of the isolated acids, in which a large excess of
hydroxyl over carboxyl functions was found.
It was suggested long ago (Fremy, 1882) that
suberin, the characteristic constituent of work, is
chemically very similar to cutin. This view was
supported by Legg & Wheeler (1925) and seems
to be generally accepted to-day (e.g. Frey-
Wissling, 1948). On considering the acids isolated
from suberin so far in a pure state, namely 22-hydr-
oxydocosanoic (phellonic), docosanedioic (phello-
genic), 9:10-dihydroxyoctadecanedioic (phloionic),
175
176 M. MATIC I956
9:10:18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic (phloionolic), 6i8-
and tran8-octadec-9-enedioic and 18-hydroxy-
octadec-ci8-9-enoic acids, it can indeed be seen
that they are closely related to the cutin acids, and
that two of them are identical (phloionolic and 18-
hydroxyoctadec-ci8-9-enoic acids). However, no
dicarboxylic acids or acids of C22 chain length were
found in the cutin preparations here described.
Another natural product, this time of insect
origin (shellac), appears to be chemically similar to
cutin. The major component (about 30-40%)
isolated from this material (Harries & Nagel,
1922) is aleuritic acid (trihydroxyhexadecanoic
acid), a homologue of phloionolic acid. Other as
yet unidentified hydroxy fatty acids of similar
chain length are also present (cf. Wright, 1949).
SUMMARY
1. The ether-soluble fraction, obtained on
saponification of cutin from Agave americana, was
resolved by means of countercurrent distribution
and reversed-phase partition chromatography, the
latter method being adapted to a preparative
scale.
2. Four acids, namely threo-9:10: 18-trihydroxy-
octadecanoic, 10 :18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic, 18-
hydroxyoctadecanoic and 10: 16-dihydroxyhexa-
decanoic acid, were isolated in a pure state. The
fifth, 18-hydroxyoctadec-ci8-9-enoic acid, was
obtained as its dihydroxy derivative.
3. The nature of cutin from A. americana and
its similarity to certain other natural products is
discussed.

gesting this problem and for guidance during this work,
