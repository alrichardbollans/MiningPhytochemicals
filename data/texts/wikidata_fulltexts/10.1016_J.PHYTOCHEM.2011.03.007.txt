Identification of Unprecedented Purine-Containing Compounds,the Zingerines, from Ginger Rhizomes (Zingiber officinaleRoscoe) using a Phase-Trafficking ApproachJuan J. Araya, Huaping Zhang, Thomas E. Prisinzano, Lester A. Mitscher, and Barbara N.Timmermann*Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045IntroductionGinger, Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Zingiberaceae), is used worldwide not only as a spice infood, but also in various traditional systems of medicine against different ailments such asarthritis, rheumatism, infectious diseases, and vomiting (Afzal et al., 2001; Ali et al., 2008).The chemistry of ginger has been extensively investigated with over 100 compoundsidentified in both fresh and dried samples (Jolad et al., 2004; Jolad et al., 2005). Ginger'snumerous biological activities have been attributed mainly to the gingerols and shogaols, themajor pungent principles found in both fresh and dried ginger rhizomes (Funk et al., 2009;Lantz et al., 2004).In the present article, we describe the isolation and structural determination of three novelpurine- containing compounds (1–3) from dry powdered ginger rhizomes using a newphase-trafficking based method (Araya et al., 2010). The methanolic rhizome extract wassubjected to our separation protocol using ion-exchange resins allowing for fast andselective resolution of the basic, acidic, and neutral components. Solid-phase reagents (SSR)are often used to facilitate and speed-up purification procedures in organic synthesis,especially in combinatorial chemistry (Flynn, 1999; Solinas and Taddei, 2007). However,application of SSR to natural products research has been limited (Alexandratos, 2009;Vanrensen and Veit, 1995; Zhao et al., 2008). Using this approach, we were able to isolateand identify three new nitrogenous compounds from ginger that were named [6]-, [8]-, and[10]-zingerines, as they are 5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl) analogs of [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerols respectively. Although present in selected microbial and marine products,secondary metabolites that contain a purine ring attached to a non-carbohydrate carbonskeleton are very rare in higher plants (Rosemeyer, 2004; Wang et al., 2008).© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and DiscussionA methanolic extract of ginger rhizomes was submitted to the separation scheme illustratedin Fig. 2 in order to explore the scope of catch-and-release methodology for natural productsresolution. This allows for quick and solvent sparing simultaneous separation of basic,acidic, and neutral components from a mixture taking advantage of ionic-exchange resinsphysically confined into spatially separated tea bags (Araya et al., 2010). As expected, thephenolic compounds, including the main gingerols and shogaols, were trapped by the basicresin (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the LCMS traces of the basic fraction revealed the presence ofseveral compounds with odd molecular weight values, which prompted us to investigatefurther the nature of such components because, to our knowledge, no nitrogen-containingbasic metabolites have been reported from ginger to date.Initially, our small-scale separation protocol allowed for the isolation of main compound 1from the basic fraction after two additional purification steps: column chromatography onSephadex LH-20 followed by semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC. The HRMS m/z412.2362 [M+H]+ (calc. for C22H30N5O2 412.2349) was consistent with the presence of fivenitrogen atoms in the molecular formula. The ESIMS/MS showed the neutral loss of m/z276.2, leaving the stable charged purine fragment of m/z 136.1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, thestructure of 1 was deduced based on analyses of the 1H, 13C NMR, 1H-1H COSY, HSQCand HMBC spectra (Supplementary Fig. 1–4) and supported by IR and UV spectra. First, thesplitting pattern and coupling constants of the aromatic protons in the 1H NMR δH 6.63 (d,J=2.0 Hz, H-2'), 6.59 (d, J=8.0 Hz, H-5') and 6.44 (dd, J=8.0, 2.2 Hz, H-6') were consistentwith a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene ring system and the corresponding aromatic carbons δC133.7 (C-1'), 113.0 (C-2'), 148.9 (C-3'), 145.8 (C-4'), 116.2 (C-5') and 121.6 (C-6') werereadily assigned with the assistance of correlations observed in the HSQC and HMBCspectra (Fig. 5). Second, the attachments of the methoxy group δH 3.76 (s, 3'-OCH3) to C-3'and methylene group δH 2.67 (m, H-1) to C-1' were established based on the correlationsobserved in the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 5). Third, the chemical shift of aromatic carbon C-4'(s, δC 145.8) suggested that this position was oxygenated. Analogous to [6]-gingerol, twospin systems corresponding to a decanyl chain were identified in compound 1 basedon 1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra, showing two distinctive structural features: aketone group δC 209.6 (s, C-3) and a methine proton δH 4.91 (m, H-5). Finally, with onlytwo proton signals left δH 8.16 (brs, H-4”) and 8.12 (brs, H-8”), five nitrogen atoms, andfive carbon signals δC 153.4 (C-2”), 150.6 (C-4”), 120.4 (C-5”), 157.3 (C-6”), and 142.6(C-8”); the presence of an adenine ring was proposed and supported by ESIMS/MSfragmentation and HMBC spectra (Fig. 5). Furthermore, adenine substitution at the C-5position explained satisfactorily the shift to lower filed of H-5 (m, δH 4.91) when comparedwith the corresponding signal of [6]-gingerol (Kim et al., 2008). This assignment wasconfirmed by synthesis (vide infra). After scaling-up the separation protocol, compounds 2and 3 were isolated showing similar fragmentation patterns in the ESIMS/MS, almostidentical low field signals in 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1), and differing fromcompound 1 only in the number of methylene groups in the aliphatic region. Accordingly,their structures 2 and 3 were assigned relative to that previously described for compound 1.Araya et al. Page 2Phytochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptAlthough purine is the most widely distributed N-heterocyclic ring in nature, purine-containing plant secondary metabolites are not common (Rosemeyer, 2004). Simple purinealkaloids, like caffeine or theanine, have a limited taxonomic distribution in the plantkingdom and a purine ring attached to a non-carbohydrate carbon skeleton, as in the case ofcompounds 1–3, is an unusual structural feature. Among the limited reports of this class ofnatural products are the cucurbitane triterpenoids isolated from Cucurbita pepo cv dayangua(Wang et al., 2008), alachalasine F–G from the fungus Podospora vesticola (Zhang et al.,2008, 2009), and a limited number of examples from marine sponges (Appenzeller et al.,2008; Wright et al., 2009; Yosief et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1–3 have not been previously reported in theliterature and they represent the first basic nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites inginger. We named this family of compounds zingerines, as they are 5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl) analogs of gingerols. Compounds 1–3 were detected in the original extract prior anypurification step using targeted LCMS analysis as well as in two extracts prepared fromadditional commercial samples of ginger rizhomes (Supplementary Fig. 9–12). The resultsshowed a strong evidence that the three new compounds were not likely to be artifacts of ournew isolation process. Interestingly, we unsuccessfully attempted to obtain zingerines usingclassic liquid/liquid partition protocols (data not shown) presumably due to the acidicphenolic group they contain that makes these compounds amphoteric and thus soluble in theaqueous phase under basic conditions. We believe that the amphoteric behavior of thezingerines coupled with their strong adsorption on silica gel are the two main reasons thathave prevented identification and isolation of these compounds in previous phytochemicalstudies of ginger.The presence of zingerines in the dried ginger rhizome extract could in theory arise from aMichael-type reaction between shogaols, dehydration products of gingerols during drying ofginger rizhome, and adenine. To explore the feasibility of such a reaction, we dissolved anequimolar mixture of [6]-shogaol and adenine in a mixture of 1:1 MeOH:H2O and stirredthe reaction mixture during 72 h at room temperature. The formation of [6]-zingerine wasonly detected by means of LCMS analysis, but not using UV detection, suggesting that onlyminute quantities of the compound is produced under those conditions (Supplementary Fig.13–14). As expected, basic and acidic catalysis increased the yield of the desired product.Using basic conditions, the reaction was scaled-up to 90 mg of [6]-shogaol and 45.2 mg (1.2eq.) of adenine under agitation for 72 h at room temperature to obtain compound 1 in 36%isolated yield. Similarly, [8]-shogaol (50 mg) and [10]-shogaol (50 mg) were subjected toidentical reaction conditions thereupon we obtained compounds 2 and 3 in 28% and 30%isolated yield, respectively (Fig. 6). The synthetically obtained products were identical to theones isolated from ginger plant material by means of 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra(Supplementary Fig. 15–20) and HPLC traces (Supplementary Fig. 21–23). This confirmedthe proposed structures of the zingerines. In addition, both natural and synthetic sampleswere optically inactive demonstrating that the compounds were racemic mixtures. This wasconfirmed by means of chiral HPLC resolution of both synthetic and natural [6]-zingerine,showing two peaks with 1:1 area under the curve (AUC) ratio (Fig. 7). Although natural [6]-zingerine was not optically active, an enzymatic origin cannot be ruled out definitivelyAraya et al. Page 3Phytochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptbecause of the possible operation of a retro Michael/Michael type reaction equilibriumleading to racemization under experimental conditions. Furthermore, identification ofbiosynthetic genes and their enzymatic products responsible for the origin of zingerineswould definitely exclude an artificial genesis. Although gingerols are present in relativelyhigh quantities in ginger rhizome, we were unable to detect free adenine in the initial extractor basic fraction using LCMS analysis (data not shown).2. ConclusionsThe use of our new catch-and-release methodology allowed us to isolate and identify threecompounds new to the literature from extensively studied ginger rhizomes. The newcompounds contain an adenine group attached to the gingerol-type carbon skeleton, anunusual structural feature in higher plants. Experiments showed that traditional solventpartition/chromatographic methods would have missed these alkaloids. We believe thatcatch-and-release methodology can be applied more widely to natural products resolutionnot only rapidly and conveniently to prepare high quality samples for high throughputscreening campaigns, but also for isolation and structural determination of novel compoundspresent as very minor components as demonstrated in this report. Biological testing of thenewly isolated compounds is currently underway and will be reported in due course.3. Experimental section3.1. General ProceduresMelting points were recorded with an OptiMelt automatic apparatus. Optical rotations weremeasured with a Rudolph RS Autopol IV automatic polarimeter. IR spectra were obtainedwith a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 380 FT-IR. UV-Vis measurements were conducted with aVarian Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and two dimensionalspectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance AV-III 500 with a dual carbon/protoncryoprobe. Agitation of samples was carried out with a New Brunswick Scientific ExcellaE1 platform shaker. Semi-preparative HPLC was conducted using an Agilent 1200 HPLCsystem with a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (5μm, 250×10 mm), flow rate of 4.5 mL/min(approx. 160 bar), injection volume of 50 μL (ca. 10 mg sample), and UV detection usingdiode array. Preparative HPLC separations were done using an Agilent 1100 HPLC systemwith a Varian Dynamax C8 (8 μm, 250×21.4 mm), flow rate of 15 mL/min (aprox. 35 bar),injection volume of 800 μL (ca. 100 mg sample), and UV detection using diode array.Chiral HPLC analysis was performed using a Chiralcel OD-H column (No. ODHOCD-LH013) purchased from Chiral Technologies Inc. (West Chester, PA) in an Agilent 1100system. The solvent system used was isocratic hexanes:isopropanol 70:30 (v/v), the flowrate was 0.9 mL/min, the injection volume was 25 μL, and UV detection at 254 nm.Compounds and resins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO): adenine 99%;cesium carbonate 99%, hydrochloric acid; Dowex™ Marathon™ WBA Anion-Exchangeresin); Dowex™ MAC-3 ion exchange resin; Sephadex LH-20.

Plant Material and ExtractionDry powdered ginger rhizomes (150 kg) were purchased from Naturex (South Hackensack,NJ) Lot. # E99/03/B8. Plant material (40 kg) was subjected to a first extraction usingCH2Cl2 (130 L) twice during 48 h. Removal of the organic solvent under reduced pressureafforded 1.7 kg of CH2Cl2 extract (4.3 %). The remaining plant material was then subjectedto a second extraction using MeOH (130 L) twice during 48h. After concentration underreduce pressure, 1.2 kg of MeOH extract residue was obtained (3.0 %). In the same way,two smaller samples (100 g) of ginger powder obtained from the same company (Lots #E99/01/B8 and #E94/01/B8) were extracted sequentially with CH2Cl2 (500 mL) and MeOH(500 mL) to afford CH2Cl2 and methanolic extract respectively.3.3. General catch-and-release procedureThe procedure was carried out as described previously (Araya et al., 2010) using 5.0 g ofMeOH extract. The resulting basic, acidic and neutral fractions were analyzed by LCMS andpurified by semi-preparative HPLC.3.4. Scale-up catch-and-release procedureThe methanolic rhizome extract (100 g) was suspended in 2 L of MeOH:H2O 1:1 mixture(v/v). A total of 200 g of prewashed Dowex MAC-3 resin was added to the mixture and leftstirring overnight. The resin was then filtered off, washed several times with pure MeOH(until the filtrate was clear) and the resin was finally left overnight stirring in 2 L of NH3 2%in MeOH. The resin was filtered off, and filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure toafford 1.9 g of basic fraction residue (1.9 %).3.5. Isolation of ZingerinesThe basic fractions from the general catch-and-release protocol were then separated bySephadex LH-20 column chromatography (100 g) using MeOH as eluent to give 80fractions (10 mL each) that were combined into 7 fractions (A–G) according to RP-TLC.Fraction F (210 mg) was then purified using semipreparative HPLC with a linear gradientprogram of acetonitrile and water from 25:75 (v/v) (t=0 min) to 35:65 (t=5 min), then 55:45(t=15 min), 100:0 (t=25 min), and finally recovery to 25:75 (t=35 min). Compound 1 (18.2mg, tR =14.7 min), compound 2 (5.2 mg, tR = 19.1 min), and compound 3 (4.8 mg, tR = 22.5min) were obtained after removal of the mobile phase under reduce pressure.3.6. Large Scale Isolation of ShogaolsPure [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-shogaol were isolated as described previously and the structures ofthe shogaols were confirmed by spectroscopic methods (Kim et al., 2008; Sang et al., 2009).3.7.

HPLC MSn analysesThe on-line HPLC/MSn analyses of extracts and fractions were performed using an Agilent1200 Series liquid chromatography system coupled to a Agilent IonTrap LCMS 6310 massspectrometer. The positive ion ESI-MS experimental conditions were as follows: HVcapillary voltage, 3.5 kV; drying temperature, 350°C; drying gas, 12.0 L/min; nebulizer, 15psi; and capillary exit voltage, 124.8V. The Frag Ampl was set to 1.0V and the smartfragmentation function was used (Smart Frag Ampl was 30–200%). Targeted analysis ofzingerines was programmed as follows: (a) for [6]-zingerine, isolation and fragmentation ofions m/z 411–413, then isolation and detection of ion m/z 136.1; (b) for [8]-zingerine,isolation and fragmentation of ions m/z 439–441, then isolation and detection of ion m/z136.1; (c) for [10]-zingerine, isolation and fragmentation of ions m/z 467–469, then isolationand detection of ion m/z 136.1. The HPLC separations were done using an Agilent EclipseXDB-C18 column (5μm, 4.6×150 mm) and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min (approx. 80 bar).The mobile phase was a linear gradient of acetonitrile and water from 25:75 (v/v) (t=0 min)to 35:65 (t=5 min), then 55:45 (t=15 min), 100:0 (t=25 min), and finally recovery to 25:75(t=35 min).3.11. General synthesis of zingerinesA mixture of shogaol (0.33 mmol) and adenine (0.40 mmol, 1.2 eq.) and Cs2CO3 (5 mg) inMeOH:H2O 1:1 (15 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 72 h. Then, organic solventwas removed under reduced pressure and filtration, the reaction mixtures were purified bysemi preparative HPLC to afford the corresponding zingerine. Accordingly, [6]-zingerine(42.7 mg), [8]-zingerine (19.4 mg), and [10]-zingerine (19.4 mg) were obtained in 36%,28%, and 30% yields respectively.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Araya et al.
