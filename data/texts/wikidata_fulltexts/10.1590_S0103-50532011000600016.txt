Introduction
The genus Guatteria Ruiz & Pav. contains close to 290 
species and is the largest genus within the Annonaceae 
family.1 Species of Guatteria are frequent constituents of 
Neotropical (lowland) forests, and it is widely distributed 
throughout Mesoamerica, the Caribbean and tropical South 
America.1
Plants of this family are known for their edible fruits and 
medicinal properties of many species.2 Previous chemical 
Chemical Constituents Isolated from the Bark of Guatteria blepharophylla (Annonaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1112
and pharmacological investigations on some species of this 
family, including Guatteria, have indicated the presence 
of important bioactive compounds, exhibiting many 
pharmacological activities, such as, cytotoxicity against 
human tumor cell lines,3-5 antimicrobial,5,6-9 and antiparasitic 
properties, particularly against Leishmania sp.,3,7,10-12 
Plasmodium falciparum 5,12,13 and Trypanosoma sp.3,12,14
Despite the importance of annonaceous members 
in folk medicine, the number of species that have been 
chemically investigated is still very small. One of them is 
Guatteria blepharophylla Mart in Mart, a small tropical 
tree that occurs in the Amazonian region (Brazil, Peru, 
Guyana, Ecuador and Venezuela).1 In Brazil this species 
is common in Amazonas and Pará states, where it is 
known as “envireira”.15 Previous phytochemical studies 
on this species described the isolation and identification 
of essential oils and isoquinoline alkaloids.8,15,16 
In continuation of our research on bioactive compounds 
from Amazonian annonaceous plants, we report herein 
the phytochemical study of the bark of G. blepharophylla 
and the evaluation of antiproliferative and antimicrobial 
properties of the main isolated compounds.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were determined on a Quimis Q-340S23 
micromelting point apparatus. UV-Vis spectra were obtained 
in CH3OH on a Hewlett-Packard HP 8452A diode array 
spectrophotometer. IR spectra were acquired on a BIORAD 
FTS-3500 GX spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were 
recorded on a Varian Saturn 2000 spectrometer operating 
at 70 eV. NMR data, 1D and 2D, were recorded at 293 K in 
CDCl3 or CDCl3 + CD3OD or CD3OD on a Bruker Avance 
DRX 400 and Brucker ARX 200 spectrometers. The 
spectrometers were equipped with a 5 mm multinuclear 
direct detection probe with z-gradient. One-bond and long-
range 1H-13C correlation (HSQC, (heteronuclear single 
quantum correlation) and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple 
bond coherence), respectively) experiments were optimized 
for an average coupling constants 1J(C,H) and LRJ(C,H) of 140 
and 8 Hz, respectively. All 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts 
(d) are given in ppm related to the TMS (tetramethylsilane) 
signal at 0.00 ppm as internal reference and the coupling 
constants (J) in Hz. Silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) was used for 
column chromatography, while silica gel 60 F254 were used 
for analytical (0.25 mm), and preparative (1.00 mm) TLC. 
Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 
light, spraying p-anisaldeyde reagent followed by heating on 
a hot plate, or spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent.
Plant material
The bark of G. blepharophylla was collected in January 
2005 on the campus of the Universidade Federal do 
Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus-AM, Brazil, and identified 
by the taxonomist Prof. Dr. A. C. Webber from UFAM. 
A voucher specimen (number 7340) has been deposited 
at the Herbarium of the UFAM. After identification, 
G. blepharophylla bark was dried at room temperature and 
finely powdered. 
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents
The dried powdered bark (1500 g) of G. blepharophylla 
was successively extracted with n-hexane followed by 
MeOH to yield n-hexane (28.18 g) and MeOH (212.50 g) 
extracts.
The n-hexane extract (3.50 g) was subjected to silica 
gel column chromatography eluted with the gradient 
systems: petroleum ether-CH2Cl2 from 100:0 to 10:90 (v/v) 
followed by CH2Cl2-EtOAc from 100:0 to 10:90 (v/v), and 
EtOAc-MeOH from 100:0 to 80:20 (v/v), affording 295 
fractions (each 15 mL). The eluted fractions were evaluated 
and pooled according to TLC analysis, to afford 24 groups 
of fractions. Fraction 4 (340.7 mg) was submitted to further 
silica gel column chromatography eluted with the gradient 
systems: petroleum ether-CH2Cl2 from 100:0 to 10:90 (v/v), 
and CH2Cl2-EtOAc from 100:0 to 10:90 (v/v), yielding 40 
subfractions that were pooled in nine subfractions according 
to TLC analysis. Subfraction 4.4 (154.7 mg) was purified 
by preparative TLC eluted with petroleum ether-EtOAc 
(90:10, v/v, two times) to give 1 (56.7 mg) and 2 (20.0 mg). 
Fraction 5 (187.2 mg) was also submitted to another silica 
gel column chromatography using the same methodology 
described for fraction 4 affording 40 new subsfractions 
that were pooled in nine groups of subfractions, according 
to TLC analysis. Subfractions 5.3 (14.0 mg) and 5.4 
(55.7 mg) were purified by preparative TLC eluted with 
petroleum ether-EtOAc (90:10, v/v, two times) to give 2 
(3.0 mg), and 3 (16.8 mg), respectively. Fraction 6 were 
also submitted to silica gel column chromatography using 
the same methodology above yielding 56 subfractions that 
were pooled in ten groups of subfractions, according to 
TLC analysis. Subfraction 6.6 was purified by preparative 
TLC eluted with petroleum ether-EtOAc (80:20, v/v, two 
times) to yield a mixture of 4 and 5 (36.1 mg).
TLC investigations indicated a high concentration of 
alkaloids in the MeOH extract. Therefore, an aliquot of 
the MeOH extract (210.0 g) was initially subjected to an 
acid-base extraction10 to give the CH2Cl2 alkaloid fraction 
(1.18 g) and the CH2Cl2 neutral fraction (5.24 g). The 
Costa et al. 1113Vol. 22, No. 6, 2011
alkaloid fraction (1.0 g) was subjected to 10% NaHCO3 
treated silica gel column chromatography10 eluted with 
the gradient systems: petroleum ether-CH2Cl2 from 100:0 
to 10:90 (v/v) followed by CH2Cl2-EtOAc from 100:0 to 
10:90 (v/v), and EtOAc-MeOH from 100:0 to 50:50 (v/v), 
yielding 97 fractions (each 25 mL). The eluted fractions 
were evaluated and pooled according to TLC analysis, to 
afford 13 groups of fractions. Fraction 4 (112.8 mg) was 
purified by preparative TLC eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH 
(95:05, v/v, two times) to give 6 (13.0 mg), 7 (7.0 mg), 
and 8 (8.0 mg). Fraction 5 (87.0 mg) was also purified by 
preparative TLC eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH (95:05, v/v, 
two times) to yield 7 (12.6 mg), 8 (2.8 mg) and 9 (2.0 mg). 
Fraction 6 (282.3 mg) was also submitted to another silica 
gel column chromatography using the same methodology 
above affording 27 new subsfractions that were pooled 
in six groups of subfractions, according to TLC analysis. 
Subfraction 6.3 (101.5 mg) was purified by preparative TLC 
eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH (90:10, v/v, two times) to give 
10 (9.0 mg). Fraction 8 was purified by preparative TLC 
eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH (95:05, v/v, three times) to give 
11 (12.7 mg). Fraction 10 was also purified by preparative 
TLC eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH (90:10, v/v, three times) 
to give 12 (31.2 mg).

In vitro anticancer activity assay 
Human tumour cell lines UACC-62 (melanoma), MCF-
7 (breast), NCI-H460 (lung, non-small cells), OVCAR-03 
(ovarian), PC-3 (prostate), HT-29 (colon), 786-0 (renal), 
K562 (leukemia) and NCI-ADR/RES (ovarian expressing 
phenotype multiple drugs resistance) were kindly provided 
by National Cancer Institute (NCI). Stock cultures 
were grown in medium containing 5 mL RPMI 1640 
(GIBCO® BRL) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. 
Penicillin:streptomycin (1000 μg mL-1:1000 UI mL-1, 
1 mL L-1) was added to experimental cultures. Cells in 
96 well plates (100 μL cells well-1) were exposed to 
sample concentrations in DMSO/RPMI (0.25, 2.5, 25 
and 250 μg mL-1) (DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C, 
5% of CO2 in air for 48 h. Final DMSO concentration did 
not affect cell viability. Afterwards, cells were fixed with 
50% trichloroacetic acid and cell proliferation determined 
by spectrophotometric quantification (540 nm) of cellular 
protein content using sulforhodamine B assay. Using 
the concentration-response curve for each cell line, TGI 
(concentration that produces total growth inhibition or 
cytostatic effect)17 was determined through non-linear 
regression analysis (Table 1) using software ORIGIN 7.5 
(OriginLab Corporation).
In vitro antimicrobial activity
The growth inhibitory activity of the crude extracts, 
fractions and isolated compounds was tested against 11 
microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 5061, Candida 
albicans ATCC 10231, Enterococcus faecium CCT 5079, 
Enterococcus hirae ATCC 10541, Escherichia coli ATCC 
11775, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa ATCC 13388, Rhodococcus equi ATCC 6939, 
Salmonella choleraesuis ATCC 10708, Staphylococcus 
aureus ATCC 6538 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 
12228).
The bacteria strains were cultured overnight at 36 oC 
in Nutrient Agar (Merck), while C. albicans was cultured 
in Saboraud Dextrose Agar. Inoculum for the assays was 
prepared by diluting a scraped cell mass in 0.85% NaCl 
solution, adjusted to McFarland scale 0.5 and confirmed 
by spectrophotometer reading at 580 nm. Cell suspensions 
were finally diluted to 104 CFU mL-1 for using in the activity 
assays. MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) tests were 
carried out according to Eloff,18 using Müller-Hinton 
broth on a tissue-culture test plate (96 wells). The stock 
solution crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds 
were diluted and transferred into the first well, and serial 
dilutions were made so that concentrations in the range 
of 1.0-0.015 mg mL-1 were obtained. Chloramphenicol 
and nystatin (Merck) were used as the reference antibiotic 
control in the range of 0.25-0.002 mg mL-1. The inoculum 
was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated at 
36 oC for 48 h. Each concentration was screened in triplicate. 
Antimicrobial activity was detected by adding 20 μL of 
0.5% TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, Merck) aqueous 
solution. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the 
sample that inhibited visible growth, as indicated by TCC 
staining (dead cells are not stained by TTC).

Results and Discussion
Once n-hexane and MeOH crude extracts were found to 
have antiproliferative activity (Table 1), these extracts were 
subjected to successive chromatographic fractionations 
as described in the Experimental section leading to the 
isolation of the chemical constituents 1-12 (Figure 1). 
Compounds 1-10 were identified by comparison of their 
spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature as 
caryophyllene oxide19 (1), lichexanthone20 (2), spathulenol19 
(3), a mixture of b-sitosterol21 (4), and stigmasterol21 
(5), O-methylmoschatoline22,23 (6), lysicamine22,23 (7), 
nornuciferine22 (8), liriodenine6,23 (9), and isocoreximine15 
(10). Compounds 7-10 were recently found on the stem 
of this species,15 while compounds 1-6, 11 and 12 were 
reported for the first time in this specie. Compound 2 is 
related for the first time in the genus Guatteria, and it is 
the second report in the Annonaceae, previously isolated 
from the roots of Rollinia leptopetala.24
Compound 11 was obtained as an orange amorphous 
powder which was positive to the Dragendorff’s test. Its 
UV-vis spectrum showed absorption peaks at 204, 238,

278 and 472 nm, which are typical of molecules with an 
oxoaporphine skeleton. The IR spectrum showed absorption 
bands at 3431 and 1646 cm-1, characteristic of phenolic 
hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum 
indicated a tetrasubstituted-oxoaporphine alkaloid. Its 
1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a pair of 
doublets at d 8.88 and d  8.24 (H-5 and H-4, J 4.7 Hz, 
respectively), which was consistent with the presence of a 
pyridine system. Additionally, it was found to have a spin 
system consisting of three hydrogens with the signals at 
d 8.96 (1H, d, J 9.0 Hz), d  7.82 (1H, d, J 2.8 Hz), and d 7.25 
(1H, dd, J 9.0 and 2.8 Hz), which were attributed to H-11, 
H-8, and H-10, respectively, and indicated substitution in 
the D ring. The signals at d 4.05, d 4.11 and d 4.17 (each 
3H, s) were assigned to three methoxyl groups located in 
the A ring, according to long-range 1H-13C correlation in 
the HMBC NMR experiment (Table 2). The presence of 
a hydroxyl group in the molecule located in the D ring at 
C-9 was established on the basis of the long-range 1H-13C 
correlation of the hydrogen H-11 at d 8.96 with the carbon 
C-9 at d 157.3, which showed no correlation with the 
methoxyl groups. 
The 13C NMR experiment along with HSQC and HMBC 
experiments allowed to verify the presence of 19 carbons, 
including a carbonyl group at d 183.1, 15 aromatic carbons 
between d 157.3-113.4, and three methoxyl groups at 
d 61.9, d 61.4, and d 60.9, which was in agreement with 
structure 11 (Table 2). The hydrogen H-8 at d 7.82 showed 
strong long-range 1H-13C correlation with the carbon C-7 
at d 183.1, which confirmed the oxoaporphine skeleton. 
According with 1H and 13C NMR 1D/2D this compound was 
identified as the oxoaporphine alkaloid known subsessiline. 
This compound has been found only in two species of 
Annonaceae Guatteria ouregou25 and G. subsessilis,26 but 
the physical data are incomplete. The 13C NMR data are 
reported for the first time. The complete physical data for 
this compound are described in this work.
Compound 12 was obtained as a blue amorphous 
powder. Its UV-Vis spectrum showed absorption peaks 
at 204, 238, 282, 304, 468 and 595 nm, which are typical 
of molecules with an oxoaporphine skeleton. The IR 
spectrum showed absorption bands at 3325 and 1660 cm-1, 
characteristic of phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. 
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 12 were very similar to 
those of 11, except for the absence of a methoxyl signal, 
which was replaced by a hydroxyl group, and absence 
of substitution in the D ring, in structure 12 according to 
the IR spectrum and NMR data (Table 2). The absence of

1.0 and 0.5 Hz), d 8.41 (1H, ddd, J 8.0, 1.6 and 0.5 Hz), 
d 7.68 (1H, ddd, J 8.6, 7.0 and 1.6 Hz), and d 7.33 (1H, 
ddd, J 8.0, 7,0 and 1.0 Hz) which were attributed to H-11, 
H-8, H-10, and H-9, respectively (Table 2). The position 
of the hydroxyl group at C-3 was established on the basis 
of the long-range 1H-13C correlation of the hydrogen H-4 
at d 8.60 with the carbon C-3 at d 166.0, which showed 
no correlation with the methoxyl groups. According with 
1H and 13C NMR 1D/2D, this compound was identified 
as the oxoaporphine alkaloid known isomoschatoline. As 
well as observed for 11, the physical data published for this 
compound are incomplete and presented in this work. The 
13C NMR data is reported for the first time. This compound 
has been found only in three species of Annonaceae Uvaria 
mocoli,27 Guatteria melosma and Cleistopholis patens.28
The isolated compounds 1-2 and 6-12 were evaluated for 
in vitro antiproliferative activity against nine human tumour 
cell lines (Table 1), while compounds 6, 7, 10 and 12 were 
also tested for antimicrobial activity. Compound 9 showed 
the higher antiproliferative activity for breast (MCF-7) 
with a TGI value of 37.67 mmol L-1, more active than 
positive control doxorubicin (TGI value of 46.04 mmol L-1). 
Compound 7 presented significant antiproliferative activity 
for lung, non-small cells (NCI-H460) with a TGI value of 
49.52 mmol L-1 (doxorubicin, TGI value of 14.27 mmol L-1), 
while compound 12 showed significant activity for breast 
(MCF-7) with TGI value of 73.97 mmol L-1. Compound 
10 showed selective activity for ovarian expressing 
phenotype for multiple drug resistance (NCI-ADR/RES) 
with a TGI value of 131.50 mmol L-1, but was less 
active than doxorubicin (TGI value of 14.80 mmol L-1 
(Table 1). Compounds 9 and 12 also showed significant 
antiproliferative activity against different tumor cell lines 
with TGI values below to 100 mmol L-1 (Table 1).
It is important to notice that compounds 6, 7, 9, 11 
and 12 shared the same basic skeleton with different 
substitution patterns. This way, our results suggested that 
a methoxylated substitute at R3 reduces antiproliferative 
activity (compound 11) or even results in an inactive 
compounds as 6, but a hydroxyl group at R3 favored the 
activity (compound 12). The best results were obtained for 
methylenedioxy group (compound 9) or methoxy groups 
(compounds 7 and 12) at R1 and R2. 
No significant antibacterial activity was observed for the 
tested compounds. The only significant antimicrobial result 
was observed for compound 12 that showed antifungal 
activity against C. albicans (MIC value of 50.81 mmol L-1) 
similar to the positive control nystatin (MIC value of 
54.00 mmol L-1). 
Conclusion
The chemical  invest igat ion of  the bark of 
G. blepharophylla has resulted in the isolation of several 
compounds common in the taxon Guatteria, such as, 1, 
3, 6, 7 and 9 that could be considered chemotaxonomic 
markers of this genus. Compounds 1-6, 11 and 12 are 
being reported for the first time in this species, and are 
important for the chemotaxonomy of Annonaceae family. 
The significant in vitro antiproliferative results obtained 
against several human tumour cell lines and antimicrobial 
activities demonstrated by the major compounds indicate 
that this species is a natural source of biologically active 
compounds. Compound 12 showed significant antifungal 
and antiproliferative activities against C. albicans and 
human tumor cell lines of breast (MCF-7). Therefore, 
studies involving mechanisms of action are necessary to 
fully understand its biological significance.
