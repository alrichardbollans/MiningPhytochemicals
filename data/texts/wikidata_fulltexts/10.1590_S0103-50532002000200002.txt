Their structures were established by chemical and spectroscopic means (1H and 13CNMR, HMBC, HMQC) as 3-methoxy-lanost-9(11)-ene (1), diosgenin (2a), yamogenin (2b), 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(S)-ethyl-22E-dihydrocholesterol (3a), 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(R)-ethyl-22E-dihydrocholesterol (3b), dioscin (4a) and 3-O-{-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(14)-[-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)]--D-glucopyranosyl}-25(S)-spirost-5-en-3-ol (4b). All these compoundswere isolated for the first time from B. decumbens and compound 4b is described for the first timeas far as we know.Keywords: Brachiaria decumbens, steroidal saponins, dioscin, diosgenin, yamogenin, triterpene.IntroductionBrachiaria decumbens Stapf belongs to a group ofplants capable of inducing hepatogenous photosensi-tizations1-4 similar to those described for Panicum spp.,5-8Tribulus terrestris,8,9 Agave lecheguilla10 and Nartheciumossifragum8. These species are all known to containsteroidal saponins which have been associated withdeposition of crystalloid material within the biliary systemand photosensitization. In our previous paper,11 wereported the isolation and structural determination ofsteroidal sapogenins present in rumen contents of lambsintoxicated with B. decumbens. In this paper we describethe structural elucidation of triterpene and steroidalcompounds isolated from the aerial parts of B. decumbensas free aglycones or as saponins. The latter compoundswere isolated as epimeric pairs.ExperimentalPlant material and extractionAerial parts from B. decumbens Stapf were collected inTeutônia, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in January2000. A herbarium specimen is on deposit in the Herbariumof the Botany Department of the Federal University of RioGrande do Sul (Herbarium ICN, Porto Alegre, Brazil, vouchernº 121456). Air-dried powdered plant material (500 g) wasextracted during 7 days at room temperature with ethanol.The solvent was evaporated and the residual alcoholic phasewas suspended in water. This suspension was partitionedwith dichloromethane and the main dichloromethanecompounds were isolated using column chromatography.IsolationPart of the dichloromethane extract (5 g) was chroma-tographed on a silica gel column and eluted with dichloro-136 Pires et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.methane:ethanol (99:1; 90:10; 80:20 and 70:30, v/v).Fractions were pooled according to thin-layer chroma-tography (TLC) analysis. Fractions 2-10 (250 mg) containingcompound 1 as main component, were further purified bysilica gel column chromatography, eluting with hexane andresulting in pure compound 1 (12.5 mg). Fractions 30-40(500 mg), 50-60 (350 mg) and 68-81 (500 mg) containingcompounds 2, 3 and 4 as main components were submittedto successive silica gel column chromatography, elutingwith hexane:ethyl acetate (3:1, v/v), dichlorometane:ethanol(9:1, v/v) and dichlorometane: ethanol (7:3, v/v),respectively. By these procedures compounds 2 (33 mg), 3(15 mg) and 4 (40 mg) were obtained.General proceduresDichloromethane extract and fractions were chroma-tographed on a silica gel column (Merck, particle size:230-400 mesh) at atmospheric pressure. TLC was carriedout on silica gel (Merck, GF254) using hexane:ethyl acetate(3:1, v/v) and dichlorometane:ethanol (7:3, v/v).Compounds were visualized by heating (120 °C) using theanisaldehyde-sulfuric acid-spray. FAB-MS spectrum wasperformed on a MS50 spectrometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMRspectra were recorded on Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer.3-methoxy-lanost-9(11)-ene (1). 1H NMR (500 MHz,CDCl3):  1.83 (H-1), 1.91, 1.75 (H-2), 2.70 (H-3), 0.89 (H-5), 1.67, 1.72 (H-6), 1.37 (H-7), 2.19 (H-8), 5.25 (H-11),1.93, 2.09 (H-12), 1.28 (H-15), 1.65, 1.71 (H-16), 1.62 (H-17), 0.67 (H-18), 0.91 (H-19), 1.41 (H-20), 0.77 (H-21),1.38 (H-22), 1.38 (H-23), 1.16 (H-24), 1.54 (H-25), 0.89(H-26), 0.90 (H-27), 1.06 (H-28), 1.00 (H-29), 0.83 (H-30),3.40 (OCH3).13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3)  36.4 (C-1),22.9 (C-2), 89.0 (C-3), 39.4 (C-4), 53.4 (C-5), 21.6 (C-6),34.3 (C-7), 42.2 (C-8), 149.0 (C-9), 37.5 (C-10), 115.2 (C-11), 37.5 (C-12), 44.5 (C-13), 47.4 (C-14), 30.1(C-15), 28.5(C-16), 51.4 (C-17), 14.8 (C-18), 18.8 (C-19), 36.6 (C-20),18.9 (C-21), 36.9 (C-22), 24.5 (C-23), 39.9 (C-24), 28.4(C-25), 22.9 (C-26), 23.2 (C-27), 22.6 (C-28), 28.6 (C-29),16.8 (C-30), 57.9 (OCH3).Compound 2a. diosgenin. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data(CDCl3): same as in references 15 and 17.Compound 2b. yamogenin. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data(CDCl3): same as in references 15 and 17.3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(S)-ethyl-22E-dihydro-cholesterol (3a). 1H NMR data (500 MHz, C5D5N): 1.71,0.98 (H-1), 2.12, 1.74 (H-2), 3.94 (H-3), 2.72, 2.46 (H-4),5.34 (H-6), 1.88, 1.54 (H-7), 1.36 (H-8), 0.89 (H-9), 1.45,1.45 (H-11), 1.97, 1.09 (H-12), 0.92 (H-14), 1.02, 1.53 (H-15), 1.26, 1.84 (H-16), 1.08 (H-17), 0.88 (H-18), 0.95 (H-19), 2.03 (H-20), 0.90 (H-21), 5.20 (H-22), 5.06 (H-23),1.56 (H-24), 1.54 (H-25), 1.07 (H-26), 0.85 (H-27), 0.95(H-28), 0.87 (H-29), 5.05 (glc H-1), 4.05 (glc H-2), 4.28(glc H-3), 4.28 (glc H-4), 3.97 (glc H-5), 4.41, 4.56 (glc H-6); 13C NMR (125 MHz, C5D5N):  37.6 (C-1), 30.4 (C-2),78.2 (C-3), 39.5 (C-4), 141.1 (C-5), 122.1 (C-6), 32.3 (C-7), 32.2 (C-8), 50.5 (C-9), 37.1 (C-10), 21.5 (C-11), 40.0(C-12), 42.5 (C-13), 57.0 (C-14), 24.7 (C-15), 28.7 (C-16),56.2 (C-17), 12.3 (C-18), 19.2 (C-19), 41.0 (C-20), 19.6(C-21), 139.0 (C-22), 129.6 (C-23), 51.6 (C-24), 32.4 (C-25), 21.7 (C-26), 19.4 (C-27), 25.9 (C-28), 12.7 (C-29),102.7 (glc C-1), 75.5 (glc C-2), 78.8 (glc C-3), 71.8 (glc C-4), 78.7 (glc C-5), 63.0 (glc C-6).3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(R)-ethyl-22E-dihydro-cholesterol (3b). 1H NMR (500 MHz, C5D5N): 1.71, 0.98(H-1), 2.12, 1.74 (H-2), 3.94 (H-3), 2.72, 2.46 (H-4), 5.34(H-6), 1.88, 1.54 (H-7), 1.36 (H-8), 0.89 (H-9), 1.45, 1.45(H-11), 1.97, 1.09 (H-12), 0.92 (H-14), 1.02, 1.53 (H-15),1.26, 1.84 (H-16), 1.08 (H-17), 0.88 (H-18), 0.95 (H-19),2.03 (H-20), 0.87 (H-21), 5.20 (H-22), 5.06 (H-23), 1.56(H-24), 1.54 (H-25), 0.85 (H-26), 0.92 (H-27), 1.28 (H-28),0.66 (H-29), 5.05 (glc H-1), 4.05 (glc H-2), 4.28 (glc H-3),4.28 (glc H-4), 3.97 (glc H-5), 4.41, 4.56 (glc H-6).13C NMR(125 MHz, C5D5N):  37.6 (C-1), 30.4 (C-2), 78.2 (C-3),39.5 (C-4), 141.1 (C-5), 122.1 (C-6), 32.3 (C-7), 32.2 (C-8), 50.5 (C-9), 37.1 (C-10), 21.5 (C-11), 40.1 (C-12), 42.6(C-13), 57.1 (C-14), 24.7 (C-15), 28.7 (C-16), 56.4 (C-17),12.3 (C-18), 19.2 (C-19), 41.0 (C-20), 20.2 (C-21), 139.0(C-22), 129.6 (C-23), 51.6 (C-24), 32.4 (C-25), 19.4 (C-26), 21.5 (C-27), 23.6 (C-28), 12.2 (C-29), 102.7 (glc C-1),75.5 (glc C-2), 78.8 (glc C-3), 71.8 (glc C-4), 78.7 (glc C-5), 63.0 (glc C-6).Compound 4.

In bothcases, the sugars were identified by co-TLC using authenticsamples.The 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1 displayed 31signals, whereas the DEPT spectrum revealed 9 methyl, 10methylene, 7 methine and 5 quartenary carbon atoms. Thepresence of an insaturation can be observed in the 13CNMR spectrum by the signals at c 149.0 (Cq) and c 115.2(CH) and, by one-proton absorbance at H 5.25 (H-11) inthe 1H NMR spectrum. These data suggest a 9(11)-lanosteneskeleton. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed the presenceof a singlet at H 3.40 (3H) correlated with the carbon at c57.9 (OCH3), demonstrating the presence of a methoxylgroup. Long range correlation peaks were detected betweenthe methoxyl signal and C-3 (c 89.0). The others signalsof 1 were established by HMBC, HMQC and 1H,1H COSYexperiments. Through detailed comparison of these datawith those from literature,12-14 1 was identified as 3-methoxy-lanost-9(11)-ene.Compound 2 presented the same Rf value of anauthentic sample of diosgenin on silica gel plates (TLC).Figure 1. Compounds 1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b isolated from aerial parts of Brachiaria decumbens138 Pires et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.The IR spectrum showed an hydroxy group (3445 cm-1).The 13C NMR spectrum showed some duplicated signalsindicating the presence of an epimeric mixture. All thesignals of 2 and their connectivity were established byHMBC, HMQC and 1H,1H COSY experiments. It waspossible to demonstrate a spiroketal ring system throughthe presence of carbon quaternary signals at c 109.7 (C-22, 2a) and 110.1 (C-22, 2b), -OCH2 group at c 67.2 (C-26, 2a) and 65.5 (C-26, 2b), and OCH group at c 81.2 (C-16, 2a) and 81.3 (C-16, 2b). The epimeric mixture was alsocharacterized through the 1H NMR spectrum by thedifferent multiplicity of the H-26 methylene protonscaused by the methyl group at C-25. In this way, compound2a showed signals at H 3.40 (t, J 11.0, H-26) and at H3.49 (ddd, J 10.9, 4.1, 2.1 Hz, H-26), and compound 2bpresented signals at H 3.98 (dd, J 10.7, 2.5 Hz, H-26) andH 3.32 (d, J 10.7 Hz, H-26), demonstrating the equatorialand axial protons. Regarding the 13C NMR spectrum, theconfiguration 25R or 25S can be differentiated by thechemical shifts for C-23, C-24, C-25, C-26 and C-27.Careful comparison of 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral dataof 2 with those of the literature15-18 allowed to establish 2as the 25-epimeric mixture of diosgenin [(25R)-spirost-5-en-3-ol] 2a and yamogenin [(25S)-spirost-5-en-3-ol] 2b.The 13C NMR of compound 3 displayed 46 signalsincluding, as determined from the DEPT spectrum, 13methyl, 11 methylene, 18 methine and 4 quaternary carbonatoms, indicating an epimeric mixture through the presenceof some duplicated signals. All signals of 3 and theirconnectivity were established by HMBC, HMQC and1H,1H COSY experiments. The NMR data showed thepresence of one sugar identified as glucose (H 5.05, d, J7.6, c 102.7) which signals have correlation to H-3. Twoinsaturations at c 141.1 (Cq, C-5) and 122.1 (CH, C-6),and c 139.0 (CH, C-22) and 129.6 (CH, C-23) togetherwith the corresponding olefinic protons at H 5.34 (H-6),5.20 (H-22) and 5.06 (H-23) are characteristic for 5,22-3-hydroxysterols. Comparing to the literature data19,20 it waspossible to verify that 3 is 24- and 24-stigmastanemixture that can be differentiated by the chemical shiftsfor C-26 and C-27, which vary about  2 ppm. Therefore, itwas concluded that 3 is the epimeric mixture of 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(S)-ethyl-22E-dihydrocholesterol (3a)and 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(R)-ethyl-22E-dihydro-cholesterol (3b, stigmasterol glucoside).FAB-MS (positive mode) of compound 4 exhibited ionsat m/z 869.5 [M+H]+, 891.6 [M+Na]+ and 907.6 [M+K]+indicating the molecular mass C45H72O16. Fragments ions atm/z 723.3 and m/z 415.3 indicated the elimination of onemethylpentose, and two methylpentoses and one hexose,respectively.21 The 13C NMR spectrum displayed 57 signals,determined from the DEPT spectrum as 8 methyl, 15methylene, 28 methine and 5 quaternary carbon atoms.Careful comparison of 13C NMR spectral data of 4 with thatof 2 showed that 4 has same aglycone moieties (an epimericmixture) and that 4 differs structurally from 2 only by thepresence of sugar signals. This assumption was confirmedby HMBC, HMQC and 1H,1H-COSY experiments.Comparing the chemical shifts of sugars with the literaturedata7,17,22 it was possible to identify them as two rhamnosesand one glucose. Using the HMBC, HMQC and 1H,1H-COSYspectra it was possible to identify the interglycosidic linkage.Through all these data we could identify 4 as dioscin (4a)and 3-O-{-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(14)-[-L-rhamno-pyranosyl-(12)]--D-glucopyranosyl}-25(S)-spirost-5-en-3-ol (4b). The latter compound was not described in theliterature, as far as we know.DiscussionOver the past years photosensitization in ruminantsgrazing B. decumbens had been associated withsporidesmin from Pithomyces chartarum. However,hepatogenous photosensitization was detected without thepresence of P. chartarum,1-4 proving the association of thedisease with the ingestion of plant saponins as, demonstratedby Miles et al.8 Such compounds are metabolized bymicrobial flora in ruminants to -D-glucuronide insolublesalts of episarsasapogenin and epismilagenin.In the case of B. decumbens, the presence of saponinswas detected and the aglicone was characterized by GC-MS after acid hydrolysis from butanolic extract,2 but thechemical structures of these saponins were not elucidated.In the present investigation it was possible to isolate andidentify the following compounds: 3-methoxy-lanost-9(11)-ene (1), diosgenin (2a), yamogenin (2b), 3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(S)-ethyl-22E-dihydrocholesterol (3a),3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-24(R)-ethyl-22E-dihydro-cholesterol (3b), dioscin (4a) and, 3-O-{-L-rhamno-pyranosyl-(14)-[-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)]--D-glucopyranosyl}-25(S)-spirost-5-en-3-ol (4b). This lastcompound is the dioscin 25-epimer and, to the best of ourknowledge, has not been previously described. All thesecompounds were isolated for the first time from Brachiariadecumbens. Diosgenin and yamogenin were alreadyisolated from the acid hydrolysis of B. decumbens butanolicextract,2 but were not isolated in the free form from thisplant. These results together with our previous work11,23demonstrated that B. decumbens, as Panicum spp., T.terrestris, A. lecheguilla and N. ossifragum, is capable ofproducing photosensitization in animals due the presenceof steroidal saponins and sapogenins.139Saponins and Sapogenins from Brachiaria decumbens StapfVol. 13, No. 2, 2002AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Prof. Eberhard Breitmaier fromKekulé-Institut für Organische Chemie der UniversitätBonn, Germany for NMR and FAB-MS measurements, toCláudio Cruz from Department of Veterinary Pathology ofthe Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil forcollecting, and Marcos Sobral from the UniversidadeFederal do Rio Grande do Sul for identifying the plantmaterial.
