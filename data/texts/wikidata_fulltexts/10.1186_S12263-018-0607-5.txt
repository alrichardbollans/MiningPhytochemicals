Dragsted6and Augustin Scalbert1*AbstractNon-alcoholic beverages are important sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds that may influence humanhealth and increase or decrease the risk of chronic diseases. A wide variety of beverage constituents are absorbedin the gut, found in the systemic circulation and excreted in urine. They may be used as compliance markers inintervention studies or as biomarkers of intake to improve measurements of beverage consumption in cohortstudies and reveal new associations with disease outcomes that may have been overlooked when using dietaryquestionnaires. Here, biomarkers of intake of some major non-alcoholic beverages—coffee, tea, sugar-sweetenedbeverages, and low-calorie-sweetened beverages—are reviewed. Results from dietary intervention studies andobservational studies are reviewed and analyzed, and respective strengths and weaknesses of the various identifiedbiomarkers discussed. A variety of compounds derived from phenolic acids, alkaloids, and terpenes were shown tobe associated with coffee intake and trigonelline and cyclo(isoleucylprolyl) showed a particularly high specificity forcoffee intake. Epigallocatechin and 4′-O-methylepigallocatechin appear to be the most sensitive and specificbiomarkers for green or black tea, while 4-O-methylgallic acid may be used to assess black tea consumption. Intakeof sugar-sweetened beverages has been assessed through the measurement of carbon-13 enrichment of wholeblood or of blood alanine in North America where sugar from sugarcane or corn is used as a main ingredient. Themost useful biomarkers for low-calorie-sweetened beverages are the low-calorie sweeteners themselves. Furtherstudies are needed to validate these biomarkers in larger and independent populations and to further evaluatetheir specificity, reproducibility over time, and fields of application.Keywords: Non-alcoholic beverages, Coffee, Tea, Sugar-sweetened beverages, Low-calorie-sweetened beverages,Biomarkers, IntakeBackgroundHuman adults consume about 3 to 4 l of water per day,which originate from plain water, solid foods, and otherbeverages like coffee, tea, soda, fruit juices, sport andenergy drinks, milk, and alcoholic beverages [1]. Besidewater, non-alcoholic beverages such as coffee and tea arealso a source of other constituents like caffeine, chloro-genic acids, diterpenes, and diketopiperazines in coffee[2], theanine, catechins, theaflavins, thearubigins andflavonols in tea [3], sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup* Correspondence: scalberta@iarc.fr1International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Nutrition andMetabolism Section, Biomarkers Group, 150 Cours Albert Thomas, F-69372Lyon CEDEX 08, FranceFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This articInternational License (http://creativecommonsreproduction in any medium, provided you gthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if(http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/ze(HFCS) in sodas, and low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) inlow-calorie-sweetened beverages (LCSBs) which mayinfluence health in a positive or negative way.Although coffee drinking was initially thought to in-duce negative effects on health, for example, increasingblood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease riskin some cohorts [4, 5], the main interest in recent yearsis the potential for positive health effects. These includeplausible reductions in risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinsondisease, Alzheimer’s disease, and liver and colorectalcancer [6–10].

Given the overconsumption of free sugars,particularly from SSBs, the use of LCSBs has increasedover the years as a strategy for reducing the free sugarcontent of the diet while maintaining palatability and re-search interest to date has focused on assessing the ef-fect of LCSB consumption on a variety of healthoutcomes such as metabolic health, weight management,and renal impairment [16, 17].Despite large efforts in unraveling these health effectsof non-alcoholic beverages on health in epidemiologicalstudies, some of these effects are not fully consistentbetween studies, and it has been suggested that this lackof agreement could be associated with the traditionalmethods used to assess beverage consumption [18].Beverage consumption is most often measured withself-administered questionnaires, and these measure-ments are known to be prone to random or systematicerrors which may prevent the detection of associationsof intake with disease outcomes [19]. These errors arelinked to limitations in the capacity of subjects toaccurately describe their beverage intake and to difficul-ties in accounting for variations in the nature of thebeverages consumed within or between populations. Forexample, concentrations of polyphenols in coffee and intea vary with the type of coffee beans or tea leaves andwith the method of coffee brewing or tea leaf infusion,information most often not recorded in dietaryquestionnaires.In contrast to questionnaires, biomarkers are object-ive measures that provide estimates of beverage in-take [20–22]. They are directly derived from beverageconstituents absorbed in the gut during digestion.Thus, they provide more direct estimates of exposureto beverage constituents and are notably independentof the dilution of the beverages, or on any aspect ofthe recipes used for their preparation. Biomarkers ofbeverage intake can be identified using two separateapproaches. Initially, biomarkers were hypothesizedbased on knowledge of beverage constituents and theirmetabolism. Beverages are fed to volunteers in controlledintervention studies and known metabolites of interestmeasured in biofluids to test for increases with intake.Until a few years ago, this targeted approach was the onlyviable method of biomarker discovery. More recently, me-tabolome profiling has taken precedence as a more com-prehensive and agnostic approach. Rather than measuringknown compounds only, biofluids are profiled to measurethe relative intensities of as many signals as can be de-tected, either by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ormass spectrometry coupled to liquid or gas chromatog-raphy (LC-MS or GC-MS). Signals associated with intakeof the target food across the most possible subjects areretained as candidate biomarkers.Initial metabolome profiling studies used an interven-tion design with a standardized dose and controlled diet,but more sensitive analytical techniques have enabledthe analysis of biofluids from free-living subjects whohave reported their beverage intakes via dietary ques-tionnaires. This approach has some advantages and limi-tations. It encourages the discovery of biomarkers thatare valid in the presence of interfering dietary factorsand that also account for differences in the time periodbetween beverage intake and biofluid collection. On theother hand, finding new biomarkers may be preventedby the limited accuracy of self-reported dietary intakedata. Whatever the discovery approach, biomarkers canonly be considered valid for the populations andbiofluids in which they are discovered as different popu-lations drink different brands or brews of a beveragewith different compositions.The purpose of this review is to describe the variousbiomarkers proposed to evaluate intake of some non-alcoholic beverages, including coffee, tea, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and LCSBs, all beveragesthat have raised much interest for being widely con-sumed worldwide and for their effects on the risk ofvarious chronic diseases. Other non-alcoholic beveragessuch as fruit juices and milk are discussed in otherchapters in this special volume. For each beverage, themain metabolites formed from their constituents andidentified in blood or urine in human dietary interven-tion studies as putative biomarkers are first described.Their eventual detection in observational studies and re-spective value as intake biomarkers is then discussed.Materials and methodsThe reviewing process made was described in details re-cently [23] and use all elements of the PRISMA state-ment [24] that were relevant for a literature search ondietary biomarkers. Original research papers and reviewswere searched for in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web ofKnowledge using the following search terms: (bio-marker* OR marker* OR metabolite* OR biokinetics ORbiotransformation) AND (human* OR men OR womenOR male OR female OR patient* OR volunteer* OR par-ticipant*) AND (urine OR plasma OR serum OR bloodOR excretion) AND (intake OR meal OR diet OR inges-tion OR consumption OR eating OR drink* OR adminis-tration) AND (‘name of beverage’). Name of beverageswere (coffee), (tea), or (diet soda OR diet beverage* ORsoft drink* OR artificial* sweet* beverage* OR low sugarbeverage* OR low calorie sweet* beverage*).The research was limited to papers in English lan-guage, and no restrictions were applied to publicationdate. End-date of search was April 2016, January 2017,June 2016, and December 2016 for coffee, tea, SSBs, andLCSBs, respectively. The research papers identifying orRothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 3 of 18using potential biomarkers of intake for the foods wereselected by one or more skilled researchers from the listof retrieved references in the process outlined inAdditional file 1: Figure S1. Additional papers were iden-tified from reference lists in these papers and from re-views or book chapters identified through the search.For each potential biomarker identified, an additionalsearch was conducted with (“the name and synonyms ofthe compound” OR “the name and synonyms of any par-ent compound”) AND (biomarker* OR marker* ORmetabolite* OR biokinetics OR biotransformation) toidentify potential other foods containing the biomarkeror its precursor. In this second step, Scifinder andGoogle Scholar were also used as search platforms,as well as the databases listed above. This secondsearch was used to evaluate the apparent specificityof the marker.Results and discussionBiomarkers have been systematically searched for in thescientific literature independently for the four types ofnon-alcoholic beverages (coffee, tea, SSBs, and LCSBs).The literature was particularly abundant for biomarkersof coffee and tea intake (Additional file 1: Figure S1).Results are successively presented below.Coffee biomarkersCoffee metabolites in controlled intervention studiesMany controlled intervention studies have beenperformed on coffee to study the metabolism of knowncoffee constituents (Table 1). Most aimed to study themetabolism of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. Typically,in these studies, a small number of subjects consumedcoffee after a washout period, and blood or urineTable 1 Metabolites identified in human intervention studies on coBeverage No. subjects Sample type Analytical method EnzymatiInstant coffee(repeated intake)5 Urine HPLC YesInstant coffee 9 Urine LC-MS YesCoffee 13 Urine CE-MS NoInstant coffee 11 Plasma, urine LC-MS NoFilter coffee 9 Urine LC-MS NoFilter coffee 13 Plasma LC-MS NoInstant coffee 11 Plasma, urine LC-MS NoCoffee(repeated intake)8 Urine 1H-NMR Nosamples were taken at intervals for analysis. In earlystudies, metabolites were quantified by HPLC after en-zymatic hydrolysis of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.Isoferulic acid concentrations most markedly increasedin urine samples taken periodically of volunteers repeat-edly dosed with coffee and was thus proposed as a po-tential intake biomarker [25]. Another such interventionindicated that caffeic acid, as well as the microbial me-tabolite m-coumaric acid, appears in 24-h urine aftercoffee intake [26]. With mass spectrometers, many moremetabolites derived from coffee chlorogenic acids werelater characterized without enzyme treatment. Forexample, individual caffeic and ferulic acid conjugateswere measured by LC-MS in the plasma and urine ofsubjects fed instant coffee [27]. Dihydroferulic acid4-O-sulfate and dihydrocaffeic acid 3-O-sulfate attainedthe highest plasma concentrations after coffee intake.Dihydrocaffeic acid 3-O-sulfate and feruloylglycine werereported as the most sensitive urinary biomarkers of in-take. Further, in a double-blind randomized controlledtrial investigating bioavailability of chlorogenic acidsfrom coffee, all chlorogenic acid metabolites increased ina dose-dependent manner in plasma and urine after theadministration of coffee containing three different levelsof chlorogenic acids [28]. Concentrations of caffeic andferulic acid sulfates were most markedly increased, butcoffee intake also caused increases of intact caffeoylqui-nic acids and sulfated caffeoylquinic acid lactones.3-Feruloylquinic acid, in both 24-h urine and plasma,was highly correlated with the caffeoylquinic acids con-sumed from coffee (Spearman r = 0.81 and r = 0.73,respectively).Despite providing a wealth of information on potentialmarkers of coffee intake, the main purpose of theseffeec hydrolysis Discriminating metabolites/candidate biomarkers ReferenceFerulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic, vanillic acids,3-hydroxyhippuric acid[25]Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid [26]Coumaric acid, caffeic acid [127]Ferulic and dihydroferulic acid sulfates (bloodand urine), feruloylglycine (urine only)[27]Trigonelline, N-methylpyridium [35]Trigonelline, dimethylxanthines, methylxanthines,dihydroferulic acid, dihydrocaffeic acid sulfate,ferulic acid glucuronide, ferulic acid sulfate,ferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid sulfate,dihydroferulic acid glucuronide, N- feruloylglycine[29]3-, 4- and 5-Feruloylquinic acid, 3 and 4-Caffeoylquinic acid lactone sulfate (urine andplasma), isoferulic acid-3-glucuronide (urine only)[28]2-Furoylglycine [30]Rothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 4 of 18controlled intervention studies was usually to investigatethe metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives ra-ther than search for novel biomarkers of intake. Otherauthors have followed the appearance of a variety ofcoffee compounds in blood or urine in subjects adminis-tered a standardized dose of coffee [29]. Dihydroferulicacid conjugates, trigonelline, caffeine, and its primarymetabolites were found to persist in plasma for longenough that they should never be fully cleared in indi-viduals drinking three cups of coffee over a day. N-2-fur-oylglycine was identified as a promising biomarker ofcoffee intake after the untargeted NMR profiling of spoturine samples from five volunteers administered a doseof espresso coffee [30]. Highest concentrations wereobserved two hours after intake. N-2-furoylglycine isderived from furans formed during coffee roasting.Biomarkers of coffee intake in observational studiesMarkers uncovered in controlled intervention studiesmay be sensitive but not sufficiently specific to the foodof interest since other possible food sources of these me-tabolites are excluded throughout the intervention. Caf-feoylquinic and feruloylquinic acids and their derivatives,for example, are also present in fruits, vegetables, andgrains [31]. Although coffee is the principal dietarysource, high intake of other confounding foods couldlead to inaccurate estimates of intake. Biomarkers lack-ing specificity are better excluded in observational stud-ies, in which subjects consume their usual diets. Foodintake is estimated with dietary questionnaires beforeblood or urine collection. The first such study on coffeehypothesized that urinary isoferulic acid, a metabolite ofcaffeoylquinic and caffeic acids, would reflect habitualcoffee intake (Table 2) [32]. Study participants, consum-ing their usual diets, recorded coffee intake via question-naires, and 24-h pooled urine was collected. Urinaryisoferulic acid excretion varied substantially between cof-fee consumers and was not strongly related to coffee in-take as reported by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)(r = 0.26) or 24-h dietary recall (r = 0.18). Another studyon 53 free-living French subjects showed a strongercorrelation (r = 0.63, p < 0.001) between 5-caffeoylquinicacid concentrations in spot urine and coffee intake, butthis association was not statistically significant whentested in 24-h urine [33]. High correlations were ob-served between coffee intake and caffeic acid (r = 0.65),protocatechuic acid (r = 0.60), and ferulic acid (r = 0.58)concentrations measured in 24-h urine collected in 475adult participants from the European ProspectiveInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)cross-sectional study [34].Later, metabolomic studies found novel markers ofcoffee intake in observational studies using untargetedapproaches. In a first such study, N-methylpyridiniumand trigonelline, products of the coffee roasting process,were found to best distinguish coffee drinkers fromnon-coffee drinkers (after analysis of urine by LC-MS)[35]. Both compounds remained elevated in urine for atleast 2 days after coffee consumption and were thusproposed as stable biomarkers of intake. N-methylnicoti-namide also distinguished the two groups, although itwas not considered specific to coffee intake, being ametabolite of niacin found in a wide range of foods. Inanother study, dihydrocaffeic acid and its 3-glucuronide,measured in 24-h urine by LC-MS, was found todiscriminate groups of high- and low-coffee consumers(identified with a food frequency questionnaire) withhigh sensitivity and specificity [36]. A later cross-sectional study in 481 subjects of the EPIC cohort, alsousing 24-h urine samples, showed significant correla-tions between concentrations of 16 phenolic acids,mostly glucuronide or sulfate esters, with acute coffeeintake as estimated with 24-h dietary recalls [37]. Dihy-droferulic acid sulfate concentrations correlated moststrongly with coffee intake whether assessed by FFQ (r =0.62) or 24-h dietary recall (r = 0.52). Dihydroferulic acidsulfate, feruloylquinic acid glucuronide, ferulic acid sulfate,and guaiacol glucuronide were the metabolites whosemeasured intensities best classified subjects into the high-est or lowest quintiles of coffee intake, with a receiver op-erating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC)for the predictive model > 94%. Non-phenolic metaboliteswere not investigated in this study.The use of 24-h urine samples yields the widest rangeof potential biomarkers, as all coffee metabolites accu-mulate in urine after coffee intake regardless of metabol-ite pharmacokinetics. Biomarkers identified in 24-hurine samples cannot be assumed to be effective markerswhen measured in spot urine or in blood samples takenat a single time point since many food-derived metabo-lites are excreted rapidly after absorption. A few authorshave searched for markers of coffee intake in spot urineor blood collections (Table 2). For example, biomarkersof coffee intake were searched for in morning spot urinesof French subjects from the SUVIMAX cross-sectionalstudy [38]. The intensities of several coffee-derivedmetabolites accurately classified consumers into high- andlow-intake groups (respectively 183–540 and vs. 0 mL/day, as measured with repeated 24-h dietary recalls and afood frequency questionnaire). The most effective of thesewere the diterpene atractyligenin glucuronide (r = 0.534,ROC AUC= 0.98), the cyclic amino acid cyclo(isoleucyl-prolyl) (r = 0.543, ROC AUC= 0.969) and the caffeine me-tabolite 1-methylxanthine (r = 0.561, ROC AUC= 0.965).Also, urinary concentrations of 1,7-dimethyluric acid,1-methyluric acid, and trigonelline each classified subjectswith an excellent sensitivity and specificity (ROC AUC >0.9).

Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 6 of 18and trigonelline concentrations as a single biomarker in-creased classification performance relative to any one sin-gle compound. Hippuric acid was elevated in the urine ofcoffee consumers, while caffeoylquinic acid-derived me-tabolites were not reported as discriminants in this study.Two further studies have identified biomarkers of coffeeintake in blood. Trigonelline, 1-methylxanthine, and para-xanthine were identified as serum biomarkers of coffee in-take when comparing high- (> 2.5 cups/day) and low- (<2.5 cups/day) coffee drinkers in an American-nestedcase-control study, along with N-2-furoylglycine and cat-echol sulfate [39]. A more detailed study on coffee in thesame cohort additionally reported that plasma trigonelline(partial r = 0.608) and quinic acid (partial r = 0.59) concen-trations best correlated with coffee intake as reported byFFQ [10]. In contrast, concentrations of unmetabolizedcaffeine correlated moderately with coffee intake (partial r= 0.327).The studies described above proposed biomarkers ofintake exclusively in urine, plasma, or serum. A smallnumber of studies have considered coffee-derived me-tabolites in other biospecimens. For example, after adose of coffee, a Japanese group was able to measurecaffeine and three isomers of dimethylxanthine in finger-prints [40]. Also, pyridine was found to increase inbreath after consumption of a large cup of espresso [41].Such techniques may not be applicable to epidemio-logical studies at present but represent possible futurealternatives to measuring biomarkers of coffee intake inblood and urine.In summary, many exogenous blood and urinary me-tabolites have been proposed as coffee intake markersbut their validity depends on study design, study popula-tion, biofluid, and analytical method. In interventionstudies where urine or blood samples are taken shortlyafter the administration of coffee, hydroxycinnamic acidderivatives such as caffeic and dihydroferulic acid (andtheir phase II conjugates) have been most commonlyproposed as biomarkers of coffee intake. Most recentstudies in free-living subjects suggest that several phen-olic acids (ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic, caffeic, anddihydrocaffeic acids and their glucuronides and sulfateesters), alkaloids (caffeine, trigonelline, and their metab-olites), cyclo(isoleucylprolyl), and atractyligenin glucuro-nide, measured in urine, are the most sensitive andspecific biomarkers of coffee intake. Fewer studies infree-living subjects were conducted on blood and trigo-nelline, and quinic acid were found to best correlate withcoffee intake.Still, it will be important to check the specificity ofthese biomarkers in the populations where implementedas the levels of coffee intake and the impact of possibleconfounders may vary between populations. Indeed,some of these biomarkers like caffeine or ferulic acidmay also arise from other dietary sources such as tea orsoft drinks for caffeine or wholegrain cereals for ferulicacid. Trigonelline and cyclo(isoleucylprolyl) or their pre-cursors may be preferred considering their high specifi-city for coffee.Tea biomarkersTea metabolites in controlled intervention studiesMetabolism and pharmacokinetics of catechins have beenstudied in a large number of intervention studies withgreen or black tea (Table 3). The main compounds de-tected in biofluids after green tea ingestion are catechins,and their metabolites formed in phase II biotransforma-tions (methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation) andring-fission reactions. EGCG, EGC, ECG, and EC werethe main compounds detected in plasma. They are quicklyabsorbed, and peak concentrations are observed about 2 hafter ingestion [42]. Tea catechins are also quickly ex-creted, and their elimination half-lives usually do not ex-ceed 3 h. EGC is the most abundant catechin in plasmaafter tea intake, mainly found in its glucuronidated form[42]. EGC is also methylated in the liver, and 4′-O-methy-l-EGC is found in both sulfated and glucuronidated forms.Galloylated catechins (EGCG and ECG) are present inplasma in their non-conjugated forms.Catechins not absorbed in the small intestine reachthe colon where they can be degraded by the microbiotainto low-molecular weight metabolites such as hydroxy-phenylvalerolactones, hydroxyphenylvaleric acids, phen-olic acids, and hippuric acid. These metabolites showlonger elimination half-lives in urine where they persistfor 48 h after tea intake [43].Most studies showed a linear relationship betweenplasma concentrations or urine excretion of tea catechinsand the ingested dose [44–48] although concentrations ofsome catechins were also shown to reach a plateau at ahigh level of intake in some studies [49, 50].Many untargeted metabolomic studies have beenconducted to elucidate additional candidate biomarkers oftea intake [51–53]. In a placebo-controlled cross-over inter-vention study based on high-resolution mass spectrometry,12 male subjects consumed a single capsule of tea extract(2.65 g) or a placebo after 1 day of a polyphenol-poor diet[54]. Fifty-nine polyphenol metabolites were identified andincreased in concentration after black tea ingestion.These metabolites were catechins, phenolic acids, valero-lactones, and simple phenols, most in the form of glucuro-nides and sulfate esters. The highest concentrations inplasma were observed within 1–4 h (catechins, kaemp-ferol, gallic acid) or 5–10 h (microbial metabolites such asphenylvalerolactones, pyrogallol, and hippuric acid),suggesting that they would be better indicators of tea in-take if measured in 24-h urine samples rather than spoturine samples.Table3MetabolitesidentifiedinhumaninterventionstudiesonteaTypeofbeverageNo.subjectsSampletypeAnalyticalmethodEnzymatichydrolysisDiscriminatingmetabolites/candidatebiomarkersReferenceGreentea,blacktea18UrineLC-ECDYesEpicatechin,epigallocatechin[49]Greentea,blacktea20UrineGC-MSYes4-O-Methylgallicacid[128]Blacktea10Plasma,urineHPLC?4-O-Methylgallicacid,gallicacid[55]Greentea,blacktea(extracts)17UrineLC-MSNoHippuricacid[129]Greentea,blacktea(decaffeinated)133UrineLC-ECDYes(−)-Epigallocatechin[60]Greentea,blacktea30PlasmaLC-ECDYes(−)-Epicatechin,(−)-epicatechin-3-gallate,(−)-epigallocatechin,(−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate[61]Greentea10Plasma,urineLC-MSNo(−)-Epicatechin-3’-O-glucuronide,(epi)catechin-O-sulfates,3’-O-methyl-(epi)catechin-O-sulfates,4’-O-methyl-(epi)catechin-O-sulfate,(epi)gallocatechin-O-glucuronide,4’-O-methyl-(epi)gallocatechin-O-sulfates(urineandplasma);(−)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate,4’-O-methyl-(epi)gallocatechin-O-glucuronide,(−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate(plasmaonly);(epi)gallocatechin-O-sulfates(urineonly)[42]Greentea20UrineLC-MSNo(Epi)catechinglucuronide,(epi)catechinsulfate,(epi)catechinsulfoglucuronide,methyl(epi)catechinsulfate,(epi)gallocatechinglucuronide,(epi)gallocatechinsulfate,methyl(epi)gallocatechinglucuronide,methyl(epi)gallocatechinsulfate,methyl(epi)gallocatechinsulfoglucuronide,5-(hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,5-(hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidesulfate,5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidedisulfate,5-(4′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,5-(4′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidedisulfate,5-(4′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidesulfoglucuronide,methyl-5-(4′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidesulfate,methyl-5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronide,methyl-5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactonesulfate[43]Blacktea4UrineLC-MSNo(Epi)catechinsulfate,O-methylcatechinsulfate,O-methyl(epi)catechinsulfates,O-methyl(epi)gallocatechinsulfates,di-O-methyl(epi)gallocatechinsulfates,dihydronaringeninsulfates,3’-O-methyl-5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone4’-O-glucuronide,4’-O-methyl-5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3’-O-glucuronide,5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3’-O-glucuronide,4’-O-glucuronide,3’-O-sulfate,4’-O-sulfateandsulfoglucuronide,O-methyl-5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3′-or4’-O-glucuronides,3′or5’-O-glucuronideandO-sulfate,5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3’-O-glucuronide,4’-O-glucuronideandsulfates,5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3’-O-glucuronideand3’-O-sulfate,O-methyl-5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactoneglucuronidesandsulfates,5-(3′-hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone3’-O-glucuronide,4’-O-glucuronide,5-(hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactonesulfate,O-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)valericacidglucuronides,4-hydroxy-5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidglucuronides,O-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidglucuronides,4-hydroxy-5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidglucuronide,O-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidglucuronides,4-hydroxy-5-(3′-hydroxyphenyl)valericacid3’-O-sulfateand4’-O-sulfate,O-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-(dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidsulfates,4-hydroxy-5-(dihydroxyphenyl)valericacidsulfates,O-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxyphenyl)valericacidsulfate,4-hydroxy-5-(phenyl)valericacidglucuronidesandsulfates,hippuricacid,indole-3-acetic-acidglucuronide,indole-3-carboxylicacidglucuronide,p-cresolsulfateandglucuronide,pyrogallol2-O-glucuronide,1-O-sulfateand2-O-sulfate,urolithinA-3-O-glucuronide,8-O-[130]Rothwell et al.

Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 8 of 18Rothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 9 of 18Some markers may be used to differentiate intake ofgreen and black tea. In particular, 4-O-methylgallic acid,formed by O-methylation of gallic acid, has frequentlybeen reported in both urine and plasma after black teaintake [55–57]. This metabolite is also detected in urineafter green tea intake but in much lower concentrations[58]. This difference in concentrations is explained bythe low content of gallic acid in green tea when com-pared to black tea. Measurement of 4-O-methylgallicacid in urine or plasma could thus be useful to differen-tiate consumption of black and green tea, particularly ifused in combination with catechins more abundant ingreen tea than in black tea [59] and present at higherconcentrations in plasma or urine after consumption ofgreen tea when compared to black tea [49, 60–62].Theaflavins and thearubigins are abundant in black teaand absent from green tea; however, their high molecu-lar weight considerably limits or prevents their absorp-tion in the gut [63] and they therefore cannot be used asbiomarkers of black tea intake.Catechin metabolites formed by the gut microbiota are,in comparison with catechins or gallic acid, less useful asbiomarkers of tea intake. Some of these metabolites (somephenolic acids and hippuric acid) were present in plasmain the absence of tea consumption [54]. This is explainedby the existence of precursors of these metabolites inother dietary sources such as coffee, cocoa, fruits, or vege-tables beside tea [64–66]. Other metabolites derived fromtea catechins such as 5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-va-lerolactone, 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)- γ-valerolactone,and/or 5-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenyl)- γ-valerolactone may bemore specific for tea intake [48, 67]. However, formationof these metabolites from catechins shows high interindi-vidual variations, compromising their potential use asbiomarkers of intake [68]. Similarly, other tea constituentssuch as quercetin or caffeine may also be of limited utilityas biomarkers due to their abundance in other foods andbeverages [69, 70].Biomarkers of tea intake in observational studiesAs previously highlighted, observational studies allowthe investigation of biomarker sensitivity and specificity.In the Shanghai Cohort Study, EGC, 4′-O-methyl-EGC,EC, and two phenylvalerolactones measured in urinewere significantly associated with self-reported tea intake[71, 72]. In another study carried out in 481 subjectsfrom the EPIC cohort, metabolic profiles were com-pared in 24-h pooled urine samples by high-resolutionMS in tea consumers and non-consumers (identified with24-h dietary recalls) [37]. Several phenolic compoundswere found to be associated with recent tea intake asassessed with a 24-h dietary recall. The compound thatbest distinguished non- and high consumers was found to be4-O-methylgallic acid (ROC AUC=0.84). 4-O-Methylgallicacid was also associated with habitual tea intake as assessedwith a FFQ despite its short-elimination half-life, and thiswas explained by frequent tea intake in this population.However, some confounding with red wine intake was alsoobserved. Other polyphenol metabolites were also found tobe associated with tea intake in the same study (methyl(epi)-catechin sulfate, dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate,hydroxyphenylvaleric acid glucuronide, and pyrogallol sul-fate), but they may not be more specific for tea than4-O-methylgallic acid, as other dietary sources of the samepolyphenol metabolites are also known. Excretion of catechinmetabolites in urine were also found to be correlated with in-take of chocolate products, apples, and pears. Pyrogallol sul-fate has also been identified in plasma after intake of nuts[73] or mixed berry fruit [74]. In another cross-sectionalstudy, 24-h urinary kaempferol was correlated with tea intake(r= 0.41; p < 0.01) [75], but kaempferol was also found to becorrelated with onion in another study [76]. Therefore, mostof these markers associated with tea intake may not be spe-cific enough for tea, depending on the possible consumptionof confounding foods in the population considered.Some catechins might be the most specific biomarkersfor tea intake. Three catechins, EGCG, EGC, and ECG,are mainly or exclusively found in tea according to thePhenol-Explorer database [59]. Galloylated catechinsEGCG and ECG and their methylated metabolites havebeen detected in both plasma and urine in tea interven-tion studies, but they may be more difficult to measurein population studies due their limited absorption in thegut when compared with other catechins [77, 78]. Insummary, EGC and its phase II derivative 4′-O-methy-l-EGC have been measured in several cohort studies andmight be a useful biomarker for green and black tea in-take [71, 72]. 4-O-Methylgallic acid, a metabolite ofgallic acid (particularly abundant in black tea), has beenassociated with black tea consumption in both interven-tion and observational studies (Tables 3 and 4). Ratio of4-O-methylgallic acid over EGC is expected to be higherin black tea consumers when compared to green teaconsumers and could help to discern which of the twotypes of tea has been consumed. A similar approachusing ratios of specific alkylresorcinols was used fordiscriminating between wholegrain wheat and rye in-takes [79, 80]. Other constituent characteristic of tea liketheanine have not received much attention and shouldalso be tested as possible biomarkers of tea intake.Biomarkers of tea intake are summarized in Table 4.Sugar-sweetened beverage biomarkersIdentification and validation of markers reflecting theconsumption of SSBs are an important task to better as-sess the association between the consumption of SSBsand related health effects.

Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 10 of 18Rothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 11 of 18what a SSB is and to the variability of their composition.One major point is the nature of the caloric sweetenersused. Beverages containing added caloric sweetenerssuch as sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) arethe main types of SSB. These beverages form a very het-erogeneous group comprising soft drinks, fruit drinks,sports drinks, energy drinks, flavored water drinks, andiced teas [81–83]. Given this diversity of products andtheir different composition, having specific markers thatreflect the intake of individual products or the total dailyconsumption of SSBs is challenging.The dominating ingredient in all SSBs is, by definition,the added sugar. Exposure markers for the intake of sugarhave been described using two different approaches, eitherthrough the measurement of the carbon isotope ratio13C/12C (expressed as δ13C value) or through the deter-mination of sugars in urine. The first approach is basedon the different discrimination against carbon dioxideformed from the 13C and 12C isotopes in plants. Crop spe-cies have been classified as C3 and C4 plants dependingon their photosynthetic pathway. The photosyntheticpathway of C3 plants like sugar beet discriminates against13CO2 compared with12CO2, and thus, the resulting plantmass carbon has a lower 13C/12C ratio than atmosphericCO2. In contrast, the C4 pathway is almost non-discriminating against 13C, resulting in a plant masshigher in 13C compared to C3 plants. Sugarcane and corn,the main sources for sugar production in the USA, are C4crops. As a consequence, sugar from these crops isenriched in 13C, compared to sugar produced by C3plants. This enrichment can be seen in whole human bios-pecimens or specific metabolites in these biospecimensafter consumption of sugars from C4 plants.The 13C/12C isotope ratio of blood plasma, finger-prickblood, or of the amino acid alanine either from hairprotein or red blood cells have been proposed in variousstudies to predict intake of SSBs and added sugar in theUSA (Table 5) [84–88]. However, this approach also haslimitations depending on the nature of the sugar sourcesTable 5 Biomarkers of intake for sugar-sweetened beverages discovNo. subjects Analytical method Sample type Discriminbiomarke144 IRMS Serum δ13C60 IRMS Blood δ13C68 GC-IRMS Red blood cells δ13C of al68 IRMS Red blood cells,plasma, hairδ13C68 IRMS Fasting plasma δ13C of g257 IRMS Blood δ13C565 1H-NMR Urine Formate ((HMDB00isocitrateconsumed in various populations. While in the USA,added sugar is mostly derived (78%) from sugarcane orcorn [89], the situation in Europe is the opposite witharound 80% added sugar derived from the C3 plant sugarbeet [90]. In consequence, the use of 13C as a potential ex-posure marker for added sugar or SSBs is limited to theUSA. Additionally, 13C in whole blood is also influencedby the intake of corn products and meat from livestockfed on corn, and thus, the intake assessment of sugarmight be confounded. Two methods have been describedto correct for these confounding food items. The firstmethod uses nitrogen-15 which is elevated in marinefoods as well as in meat products. Therefore, it was sug-gested to use this second isotopic marker as control forthe intake of animal protein [86, 87, 91, 92]. Nash et al.[87, 92] found favorable results in a study population ofYup’ik Eskimos consuming low amounts of sugar fromsources not 13C-enriched such as sugar beet, honey, fruits,or dairy products, but high amounts of fish and marinemammals compared to other US populations. They wereable to explain three times as much variation in the sweet-ener intake by using a model including both the carbonand nitrogen isotope ratios than by using δ13C alone. Incontrast, Fakhouri et al. [86] and Hedrick et al. [91] foundno significant improvement in their results after correct-ing for the animal protein intake using nitrogen-15 in apopulation where more corn-fed meat is consumed. Thesecond method to correct for confounders is based on theuse of a specific metabolite to measure 13C, which favorsthe incorporation of glucose carbon like alanine asdescribed by Choy et al. [84]. They found no associationbetween the 13C of alanine and dietary confounders likecommercial meat, fish, and corn products. At thesame time, they found that a dual-isotope modelusing 13C and 15N in red blood cells was associatedwith meat intake as well as sweeteners. The use of alanineas a specific metabolite shows favorable results in this re-spect, but further research is needed, especially concern-ing different populations.ered in observational studiesating metabolites/candidaters (HMDB ID)Association with Reference24-HDR (× 2) [86]4-day dietary record [85]anine (HMDB0000161) 24-HDR (× 2) [84]24-HDR [87]lucose (HMDB0000122) 24-HDR [87]24-HDR (× 3), 4-daydietary record[91]HMDB0000142), citrulline00904), taurine HMDB0000251,(HMDB0000193)4-day dietary record [95]Rothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 12 of 18The second approach for calculating sugar intakeuses urinary sucrose and fructose as exposure markers[93, 94]. Details on the different intervention studies andsurveys were recently reviewed [93]. For this exposuremarker, no information on its applicability for SSBs iscurrently available.Both approaches, the carbon isotope ratio of differentbiospecimens and urinary fructose and sucrose, showpromise as exposure markers for sugar and sucrose in-take. However, sugar alone does not appear suitable asan exposure marker for SSB consumption because it isalso contained in hundreds of other food items and isthus not specific. The use of an exposure marker forsugars in combination with additional substances usedas ingredients might prove to be more specific. However,ingredients used in SSBs vary depending upon the typeof SSB. Citric acid is added to many types of widely dis-tributed SSBs as acidity regulator. However, citric acidseems not suitable as a marker for SSB consumptionsince it is produced in large quantities in the human me-tabolism. Moreover, it also naturally occurs in large con-centrations in fruits and fruit juices. Other typicalingredients in SSBs are natural or artificial flavors suchas ginger extract for ginger ale or caffeine for cola typebeverages. Using these compounds or their metabolitesas markers would consequently only cover specific sub-groups of SSBs. Their specificity should also be carefullyassessed as some of these substances may also beingested with other foods, like coffee in case of caffeine.A more reliable approach to reach a high specificitywhen assessing intake of a whole food group such asSSBs might be to use a combination of exposuremarkers as described by Gibbons et al. [95]. In thisstudy, a subcohort of 565 participants from the NationalAdult Nutrition Survey was divided into four quartiles.Four metabolites detected by NMR spectroscopy inurine—formate, citrulline, taurine, and isocitrate—showed concentration levels that differed significantlybetween SSB consumers (n = 146) and non-consumers(n = 391) as identified via a 4-day semi-weighed foodrecord. Levels of these same four metabolites alsoshowed transient and modest increase in an acute inter-vention study (n = 10) after the consumption of one canof cola. The authors detected all four markers in the coladrink used for the acute intervention study. Althoughfound in the cola drink, none of these compounds arenormally added in a pure form so that they would mostlikely originate from added flavor extracts. It also re-mains questionable whether these markers are indicativeof intake of the whole group of SSBs or cola consump-tion only. So-called energy drinks often contain taurine,a sulfur-containing amino acid. Thus, taurine mightserve as a marker for this specific type of beverage.However, it is unlikely that taurine is present in all typesof SSB. Furthermore, other sources of taurine cannot beexcluded. Taurine is formed in human metabolism frommethionine and cysteine with an endogenous averagedaily synthesis of 0.4–1.0 mmol (50–125 mg) [96]. Meatand seafood are significant dietary sources of this aminoacid [93]. Similarly, isocitrate is an intermediate of thecitric cycle—like citrate—and, therefore, occurs in allhumans, animals, and plants. These examples demon-strate that the urinary excretion of these compounds canhave different origins that interfere with their use asmarkers of exposure for SSBs. Further validation of theproposed panel of biomarkers in other populations isstill necessary. Furthermore, more research is needed toidentify new markers or marker panels with higher spe-cificity and selectivity.In summary, biomarkers of sugar intake would not beideal biomarkers of SSB intake due the diversity of diet-ary sources of sugar. One exception may be the 13C/12Cisotope ratio in countries where sugarcane and cornsugar is more specifically used as SSB sugar. Other SSBingredients or combinations of ingredients might beused as biomarkers of intake for SSBs or for specifictypes of SSB. However, none of these biomarkers haveyet been validated in population studies.Low-calorie-sweetened beverage biomarkersNo studies were identified which specifically aimed toidentify biomarkers of LCSB intake. Rather, many of thestudies investigated the impact of LCSB consumption onhealth via the measurement of effect biomarkers in rela-tion to metabolic syndrome [97], blood pressure [98],and glycemic control [99, 100]. LCSB consumption wasfound to influence the concentration of various com-pounds including urinary hippuric acid excretion [101],serum uric acid concentrations [102], and plasma freefatty acid concentrations [103]. However, these bio-markers are not specific to LCSBs; hippuric acid is a po-tential marker of toluene exposure, as well as fruit andvegetable intake, and serum uric acid and plasma freefatty acids are endogenous compounds influenced byfactors other than LCSB intake. Therefore, utilization ofthese biomarkers is unlikely to provide useful informa-tion on LCSB intake owing to a lack of specificity. Sev-eral advanced glycation end products were found to bepresent in regular and, to a lesser extent, in diet coladrinks. They are normally excreted via the urine, butthey are also confounded by other more significant diet-ary sources of these compounds [104]. Brominated vege-table oil (BVO) is used in North America as a cloudingagent in some soft drinks but is not permitted for use inmany other areas, including the European Union, owingto concerns about bromine toxicity. Bendig et al.assessed the BVO content of commonly consumed softdrinks, and BVO was detected in only three out of theRothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 13 of 18ten drinks investigated indicating that tissue bromineconcentrations would not serve as a reliable biomarkerof LCSB intake [105]. Eisner et al. assessed the citrateand malate content of diet beverages in the context ofthe treatment of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) [106],but these two organic acids are not specific forLCSBs and may be directly influenced by other diet-ary and non-dietary factors or may not be relevantfor all LCSBs.Given that the term LCSB encompasses an array ofproducts including carbonated beverages, fruit cordials,sweetened dairy products, and flavored teas, all of whichare likely to differ significantly in their composition, theidentification of a specific biomarker of intake which isspecific to all LCSBs as a single food group is likely tobe challenging. The low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) them-selves, common to a large diversity of LCSBs, may proveto be the most useful biomarkers of LCSB intake. Thereare eleven LCSs currently approved for use on the Euro-pean market (Additional file 2: Table S1), and their useextends to a wide range of foods other than LCSBs, aswell as non-dietary products such as oral hygiene prod-ucts and e-cigarette fluids [107]. Although this maycomplicate the use of LCSs as valid markers of LCSB in-take, LCSBs are widely considered to be the primarysource of LCSs in the diet; and therefore, measurementTable 6 Metabolic fates of low-calorie sweeteners approved in theSweetener (CAS registry no.)

The metabolic fate of eachLCS is assessed prior to approval for use as a food addi-tive (Table 6); and therefore, a targeted approach may beimplemented for those that lend themselves well toanalyses. A number of LCSs are excreted in urine in thesame form as found in the LCSBs. Acesulfame-K [108]and saccharin [109–111] are almost completely absorbedand excreted unchanged via the urine. The usefulness ofurinary excretions of these two LCSs as biomarkers ofintake was investigated by Wilson et al. who measuredlevels of excretion in 24-h urine samples and found highcorrelation with acute intakes of saccharin andacesulfame-K in an intervention study with five differentdoses of the LCS (R2 > 0.99 for both compounds), dem-onstrating a clear dose-response relationship for bothcompounds [112]. Two other LCSs, cyclamate [113] andsucralose [114, 115], are partially absorbed (respectively30–50 and 10–15%) and subsequently excreted un-changed in urine. A proportion of cyclamate is con-verted to cyclohexylamine via bacterial hydrolysis in thegut in around 20% of the population. This is thenabsorbed and excreted via the urine [116].

Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 14 of 18of conversion to cyclohexylamine is highly variable be-tween and within individuals, particularly during chronicexposure [113]; and therefore, some doubt must be caston its usefulness as a reliable marker of cyclamate intakein the free-living population. A relatively new and increas-ingly used LCS, a mixture of steviol glycosides isolatedfrom the leaf of Stevia rebaudiana, undergoes bacterialhydrolysis in the gut prior to absorption and subsequentexcretion in urine as steviol glucuronide [117–119].Advantame is deesterified to advantame acid and a smallproportion is absorbed (~ 6%) and excreted via the urine[120]. The excretion products of acesulfame-K, saccharin,sucralose, cyclamates, steviol glycosides, and advantameare highly specific to exposures to the parent compoundper se as they are not produced endogenously. Therefore,any detection of these in urine would indicate intake ofthe related sweeteners. However, further work would berequired to assess their specificity as biomarkers of LCSBintake.Other LCSs, namely aspartame, neohesperidine dihy-drochalcone (NHDC), and thaumatin, undergo extensivemetabolism into metabolites commonly found in thediet or in the body, which suggests that no obvious spe-cific biomarkers of intake exist for these LCSs. Aspar-tame is broken down to its three constituents, asparticacid, phenylalanine, and methanol, all of which are oftenpresent in greater quantities in other dietary sources[121, 122]. Thaumatin, a naturally occurring proteincomplex, undergoes normal protein digestion; and there-fore, identification of a specific biomarker of intake isnot likely to be possible [123]. Finally, NHDC has asimilar structure to naturally occurring flavonoids withsimilar metabolites; and for this reason, specificity of anyputative biomarker is likely to be problematic [124].In summary, a biomarker approach for assessing intakeof specific LCSs used in LCSBs may prove useful as sev-eral of them are excreted unchanged in urine following in-gestion. Expected biomarkers should be based on LCSsmost commonly used in LCSBs. However, considering therange of LCSs used in different types of LCSBs, thegeographical differences and the evolving nature of LCSuse by manufacturers, further work is required to ensurethe specificity of the putative biomarkers. This work maytake the form of comprehensive and international labelsurveys along with biomarker validation studies for spe-cific LCSBs. As such, more work will be needed to validatetheir use as biomarkers of LCSB intake, considering allthese factors, and to identify possible confounding byother foods containing the same LCSs.ConclusionsA wide diversity of biomarkers has been proposed toestimate the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages.Metabolism of major constituents of non-alcoholic beverageshas been studied in a large number of controlled interventionstudies, and many metabolites were identified mainly inblood and urine (Tables 1 and 2). Participants in these stud-ies have usually consumed a high amount of a particular bev-erage with a fully controlled diet after a proper washoutperiod. These studies are useful for identification of putativebiomarkers of intake, but provide limited evidence of theirpotential value as biomarkers of intake in a population andmore particularly of their sensitivity and specificity.Several of these candidate biomarkers have been fur-ther studied in observational studies with individualsfollowing their own diet and their sensitivity and specifi-city as indicators of coffee, tea, and SSB intake evaluated(Tables 1, 2, and 3). Various compounds including phen-olic acids, alkaloids, and terpenes measured in urine orplasma samples were shown to accurately predict coffeeintake in various populations, and EGC and 4-O-methyl-gallic acid were also shown to be good indicators of teaintake. These two last biomarkers could also possibly beused to differentiate intake of green and black tea.Several biomarkers have been proposed to estimate SSBintake but none for LCSB intake. Difficulties met in find-ing biomarkers for these two last classes of beveragesare explained by the lack of constituents that would beat the same time characteristic of each of these twogroups of beverages and absent in all other foods.Controlled intervention studies and observation studiesare complementary. The first ones provide direct evidenceof the causality of the associations between beverage intakeand the biomarker and allow establishing the dose-effectrelationship. Observational studies, although relying onself-reported estimate of beverage intake that are liable toerrors, allow to study the sensitivity and selectivity of abiomarker and to identify potential confounders.Combinations of biomarkers may be needed to assessintake of SSBs and LCSBs. Combinations of biomarkersmay also allow the estimation of intake of different typesof beverages within a particular group, as suggested forgreen and black tea. Combination of a generic biomarkerfor coffee with caffeine should help assess relative intakeof caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Panels of bio-markers of intake have been proposed, but none has yetbeen validated.The new biomarkers, identified through metabolomicsor other approaches, will need to be validated in popula-tions sharing similar lifestyle and diet to the ones wherethese biomarkers will be used. All possible confounders(e.g., foods containing the same biomarker or a precursortransformed into the biomarker in the body) will need tobe carefully considered [37]. More extensive food compos-ition data for these compounds, often scattered across alarge number of publications and not easily analyzed, willhave to be collected and made easily accessible in new da-tabases such as those developed for polyphenols or forRothwell et al. Genes & Nutrition  (2018) 13:15 Page 15 of 18caffeine [59, 125]. Biomarkers with long eliminationhalf-lives should be preferred particularly to assess intakesof foods more episodically consumed [126] although thismay be less important for beverages like coffee or tea mostoften consumed on a daily basis [37]. Finally, the practical-ity of biomarkers will need to be assessed, including theirperformance according to the type of biospecimens (e.g.,urine vs. blood, fasting vs. non-fasting blood samples or24-h urine samples vs. spot urine samples), performanceof analytical methods, and cost of analyses.Overall, biomarkers should help estimate intake ofnon-alcoholic beverages and this may be particularlyuseful in overcoming some of the limitations met withdietary questionnaires. It is expected that these bio-markers will be increasingly used in cohort studies toevaluate the effects of non-alcoholic beverages on dis-ease risk. However, it will also be important to carefullyevaluate the respective advantages of biomarkers andquestionnaires, an evaluation that has not been done yet.Additional filesAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
