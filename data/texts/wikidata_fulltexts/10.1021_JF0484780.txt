Austin State University,Nacogdoches, Texas 75962Leaf spots and root rots are major fungal diseases in Camptotheca acuminata that limit cultivation ofthe plant for camptothecin (CPT), a promising anticancer and antiviral alkaloid. Bioassays showedthat pure CPT and flavonoids (trifolin and hyperoside) isolated from Camptotheca effectively controlfungal pathogens in vitro, including Alternaria alternata, Epicoccum nigrum, Pestalotia guepinii,Drechslera sp., and Fusarium avenaceum, although antifungal activity of these compounds in theplant is limited. CPT inhibited mycelial growth by approximately 50% (EC50) at 10-30 íg/mL andfully inhibited growth at 75-125 íg/mL. The flavonoids were less effective than CPT at 50 íg/mL,particularly within 20 days after treatment, but more effective at 100 or 150 íg/mL. CPT, trifolin, andhyperoside may serve as leads for the development of fungicides.KEYWORDS: Camptotheca; camptothecin; trifolin; hyperoside; antifungal activity; chemical defenseINTRODUCTIONCamptotheca Decaisne (happytrees) of the family Nyssaceaeis the major source of camptothecin (CPT) and its analogues,promising anticancer and antiviral indole alkaloids (1). Thestructure of CPT isolated from Camptotheca acuminata Decaisnewas reported in 1966 (2, 3). Two CPT drugs, Hycamtin andCamptosar, have received FDA approval for the treatment ofovarian and lung cancers and for colorectal cancer, respectively(3). Together they account for nearly 8% of the total $15 billionof the global cancer drug market. Orathecin is being consideredby the FDA for accelerated approval for the treatment ofpancreatic cancer, with 14 other CPT drugs currently undergoingclinical trials (4). CPTs also show promising potential asantiviral (HIV and herpes) (1), antifungal (Candida) (5), andantipsoriasis (1) drugs, and as pesticides (6). To date, com-mercial CPT synthesis is not feasible, and supplies of CPTrequired to manufacture the drugs are now extracted from thefruits of C. acuminata, listed as an endangered species in Chinasince 1997 (4). Cultivation of the tree is limited because it growsin subtropical climates. Moreover, the tree takes approximately10 years to produce a stable fruit yield. Recently, two newspecies of Camptotheca were added to the previously monotypicgenus, and several high-yielding cultivars such as Katie havebeen developed to harvest intact young vegetative tissues (4).Furthermore, “trichome management” was developed to inducethe biosynthesis of CPTs to levels 16-20 times that normallyobserved in Camptotheca (7). Eleven years of greenhouse andfield trials in Texas have shown great potential for future supplyof CPTs (Camptotech, Inc., unpublished data).Fungal diseases, particularly leaf spots and root rots, are themain limiting factors in the cultivation of Camptotheca inplantations for vegetative biomass and CPT production. In apreliminary study, seven fungal pathogens have been isolatedfrom various tissues of C. acuminata: Alternaria alternata,Epicoccum nigrum, and Pestalotia guepinii caused leaf spots;Discula umbrinella, Drechslera sp., and Nectria sp.; FusariumaVenaceum caused root rots (8). Interestingly, however, weobserved that fungal diseases were primarily found on theCamptotheca varieties and tissues with lower CPT contents,while fungal inoculation on young leaf tissues with high CPTcontent failed. Considering CPT’s potent bioactivity againsttumors, viruses, pests, and Candida (1, 5, 6), we conducted thisin vitro antifungal assay to determine if CPT inhibits the fungithat often infect the Camptotheca trees. In addition to thealkaloid CPT, trifolin and hyperoside (Figure 1), two flavonoidsabundantly occurring in C. acuminata leaves (9), are includedin this study. These flavonoids commonly occur in a wide rangeof plants and have shown bactericidal activity (10, 11). AbouZeid found that crude extracts and flavonoids isolated frombanana (Musa), including trifolin and hyperoside, have someantifungal activities (12). However, several anomalous reportslead to uncertainty as to the antifungal activities of trifolin andhyperoside. Funayama et al. (1995) found that trifolin wasinactive against yeasts at 1000 íg/mL (13). Lu et al. (2002)found that hyperoside was inactive in in vitro bioassays againstyeasts, Fusarium, and other fungi at >100 íg/mL (14).Dall’Agnol et al. reported that crude extracts of Hypericum,* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Thepresent study investigates the in vitro antifungal activity of CPT,trifolin, and hyperoside, naturally occurring in C. acuminata,against five fungi isolated from the leaves. The results willprovide a basis for developing strategies to control fungalpathogens in Camptotheca plantations and to enhance CPTproduction.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Materials. Leaves of C. acuminata were collected in Nacog-doches, TX, in June 2002. A voucher specimen (S. Y. Li and Z. Z.Zhang US-TX-AH-02-0601012) has been deposited at the Center forMedicinal Plant Research of Stephen F. Austin State University.Chemical Analyses. Camptothecin (1), trifolin (2), and hyperoside(3) (Figure 1) were previously isolated from the leaves of C. acuminata(9). Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods. The1H and 13C NMR data of these compounds are in agreement with thosefrom refs 16-18. General experimental procedures and extraction andisolation methods are described in detail in ref 9.Antifungal Assays. A. alternata, E. nigrum, P. guepinii, Drechslerasp., and F. aVenaceum were isolated from infected leaves and roots ofC. acuminata grown in Nacogdoches, TX, in 2001 and 2002. The strainswere cultured and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) mediumat 24 °C.CPT, trifolin, and hyperoside isolated from C. acuminata were testedfor their ability to inhibit these fungi with two standard classicalfungicides, Bravo (active ingredient chlorothalonil) and Maneb (activeingredient manganous ethylenebis[dithiocarbamate]). The concentrationsof the fungicides were those recommended by the manufacturers (Bravo,10000 íg/mL; Maneb, 3000 íg/mL). In addition to a negative control(0) and two fungicides as positive controls for each of the five isolatedpathogens, seven concentrations of CPT were tested with each of thefungi and three levels of trifolin and hyperoside were tested with P.guepinii, Drechslera sp., and F. aVenaceum, respectively (Table 1).Trifolin and hyperoside treatments were applied at concentrations of50, 100, and 150 íg/mL, respectively. For all cultures, final concentra-tions were made in molten (50 °C) potato dextrose agar (Difco), and10 mL aliquots were poured into Petri dishes (85 mm in diameter).Within 24 h after pouring, each of the plates was inoculated with oneof the five fungi. One 5  5 mm mycelial plug was cut from the activelygrowing front of a 2 week old colony, then placed with the inoculumside down in the center of each treatment plate, and incubated at 24°C. For all experiments, five replicate plates were inoculated for eachtreatment.Mycelial growth on each plate was observed daily, recorded on atransparent film for the first two weeks, and then recorded on the 16th,20th, 23rd, and 28th days. Colony radii were measured along fourvertical radial directions. The mean of the four measurements wascalculated as the growth rate on each plate. The mean and standarderror were calculated from the five replicates of each treatment. Foreach of the fungi, values of EC50 and MIC of each compound wereestimated.RESULTSAntifungal Activity against A. alternata. CPT significantlyinhibited Alternaria growth at 10 íg/mL (CPT-10) (p < 0.001).Colonies exposed to CPT-10 were inhibited 41-66%; it took23 days for mycelium under the CPT-10 treatment to completelycover the agar surface, compared to 13 days under the controltreatment. CPT-25 (CPT at 25 íg/mL) was similar to Bravo inits ability to inhibit A. alternata (Figure 2). Colonies in bothtreatments started to grow on the second day of the experiment,and their radii were always within about 1 mm of one another.CPT-25 colony expansion was reduced by 215% (28 days tocover the agar surface vs 13 days for the control). On day 13,colonies in the CPT-25 treatment were 52.8% smaller than thoseof the controls. Thus, it is estimated that the EC50 of CPT forA. alternata is <25 íg/mL. The CPT-50 treatment was able toinhibit fungal growth by more than 180%. The fungus wastotally controlled by CPT at 75 íg/mL (CPT-75) and above,and by Maneb.Table 1.

Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 1, 2005 33Antifungal Activity against E. nigrum. E. nigrum grewfaster than A. alternata under control conditions in the experi-ment, with colonies covering the agar surface in 10 days (Figure3). However, this fungus was more strongly inhibited by CPTand fungicide than A. alternata. CPT at 10 and 25 íg/mLdelayed mycelial growth of E. nigrum by 280% (28 days tocover the agar surface vs 10 days for the control). CPT-10 andCPT-25 treatments were not significantly different in inhibitingE. nigrum. On day 10, colonies in the CPT-10 treatment were65% smaller than those of the controls. Thus, the EC50 of CPTfor E. nigrum is estimated to be <10 íg/mL. Similar to resultswith A. alternata, CPT at 50 íg/mL inhibited growth of E.nigrum by >90% while CPT at 75 íg/mL and higher concen-trations, as well as Maneb, totally inhibited growth. Bravotreatment was slightly superior to CPT-10 and CPT-25 treat-ment. Colonies exposed to Bravo did not start to grow until thefifth day; by day 15 they had radii of 13 mm compared to 20mm in the CPT-25 treatment. The CPT-50 treatment wassuperior to Bravo treatment. Under this treatment, growth didnot begin until the eighth day of the experiment. On day 20,colony radii measured 19 mm under Bravo treatment but only8 mm when exposed to CPT-50.Antifungal Activity against P. guepinii. P. guepinii showeda growth pattern similar to that of E. nigrum under controlconditions (Figure 4). CPT-10 reduced mycelial growth by43.5% on the 11th day when the fungus under the controltreatment had covered the agar surface. Colonies exposed toCPT-10 treatment did not reach the Petri dish margins until day20. Thus, it is estimated that the EC50 of CPT for P. guepinii isapproximately 10 íg/mL. However, CPT totally inhibitedgrowth only at g125 íg/mL. Both fungicides also successfullycontrolled P. guepinii. Trifolin and hyperoside were similar intheir abilities to inhibit P. guepinii. On day 11, colonies exposedto either trifolin-50 or hyperoside-50 were inhibited by 53.4%and 53.8%, respectively. The EC50 of both flavonoids for P.guepinii is estimated to be approximately 50 íg/mL. However,as concentrations increased to 100 íg/mL, the flavonoids weremore effective in inhibition of P. guepinii than CPT; MICs ofboth trifolin and hyperoside for P. guepinii are most likely below125 íg/mL, the level at which CPT successfully controlled thefungus.Antifungal Activity against Drechslera sp. Drechslera sp.grew more slowly than A. alternata, E. nigrum, and P. guepiniiunder control conditions but was also more sensitive to CPT,flavonoids, and fungicides than the other fungi tested (Figure5). CPT at all experimental levels showed greater inhibition ratesthan Bravo. This fungicide reduced mycelial growth by 54.4%on day 20, when control mycelium completely covered the agarsurface. Thus, the EC50 of CPT for Drechslera is <10 íg/mL.However, CPT only completely inhibited fungal growth at g100íg/mL. Trifolin-50 and hyperoside-50 (trifolin and hyperosideFigure 3.

Points and bars represent the means andstandard errors of five replicates.34 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 1, 2005 Li et al.at 50 íg/mL) were similar in their ability to inhibit Drechslera.On day 20, colonies exposed to either trifolin-50 or hyperoside-50 were inhibited by 76.1% and 74.3%, respectively. Thus, theEC50 values of both flavonoids against Drechslera are <50 íg/mL. Hyperoside-100 (hyperoside at 100 íg/mL) inhibited fungalgrowth successfully, with little growth by day 28, while trifolin-100 (trifolin at 100 íg/mL) totally controlled the fungus overthe course of the entire experiment. CPT at g100 íg/mL, trifolinat g100 íg/mL, hyperoside at 150 íg/mL, and Maneb com-pletely inhibited Drechslera.Antifungal Activity against F. aWenaceum. F. aVenaceumexhibited the slowest growth rate of all experimental fungi undercontrol conditions, but was somewhat less sensitive to CPT,flavonoids, and fungicides (Figure 6). Bravo showed effectiveinhibition of mycelial growth during the first several days ofthe experiment but was less effective in the later stages. Onday 28, mycelium with Bravo treatment completely covered theagar surface similar to the control colonies. CPT-10 was muchmore effective than Bravo, with 70-80% inhibition of mycelialgrowth during the first several days of the experiment andapproximately 40% inhibition in the later stages. CPT-30inhibited the rate of mycelial growth by >60%. Thus, the EC50of CPT for F. aVenaceum is estimated to be between 10 and 30íg/mL. Higher levels of CPT more effectively inhibited mycelialgrowth, but complete inhibition was not achieved until 125 íg/mL. Trifolin and hyperoside exhibited similar inhibition patternsat 100 íg/mL, but trifolin was more effective than hyperosideat 50 íg/mL. Trifolin-50 and hyperoside-50 were less effectiveagainst F. aVenaceum than Bravo and CPT-10 at the beginningof the experiment but more effective than Bravo and similar toCPT-10 during the later stages of the experiment. On day 28,trifolin and hyperoside inhibited fungal growth by 35.8% and31.6%, respectively, at 50 íg/mL, and by 74.8% and 72.6%,respectively, at 100 íg/mL. Thus, it is estimated that EC50 valuesof both flavonoids against F. aVenaceum are between 50 and100 íg/mL. Hyperoside at 150 íg/mL completely inhibitedfungal growth during the first four weeks, while trifolin at thesame level totally controlled the fungus during the entireexperiment. CPT at g125 íg/mL and Maneb also completelyinhibited growth of F. aVenaceum.DISCUSSIONFungal Pathogens of C. acuminata. Leaf spots caused byAlternaria, Epicoccum, and Pestalotia and root rots caused byFusarium are major fungal diseases affecting biomass and CPTproduction in C. acuminata cultivation. Alternaria is commonlyfound on leaf spots and dead tissues of C. acuminata. Leaf spotsoften increase in severity as the season progresses and leavesbecome mature (19). Leaves die and drop off prematurely, andyields decreased as a result of the plant’s decreased ability tocarry out photosynthesis. E. nigrum is a common cause of leafspots in C. acuminata. It is a cosmopolitan saprophyte foundon many plants, textiles, paper products, and foodstuffs, in soils,and in air samples. P. guepinii is primarily a secondary pathogen.It is saprophytic on dead and dying tissues and is weaklyparasitic, infecting through wounds under moist conditions.Drechslera sp. are either plant pathogens or saprobes. Fusariumis a soil-borne fungus with worldwide distribution, particularlythroughout tropical and subtropical areas.Antifungal Activity of Alkaloid and Flavonoids Isolatedfrom C. acuminata. Bioassays showed that the pure alkaloidCPT and the flavonoids trifolin and hyperoside isolated fromC. acuminata can effectively inhibit the above fungal pathogensin vitro. CPT can effectively inhibit mycelial growth by 50%(EC50) at relatively low concentrations: approximately 10 íg/mL for E. nigrum, P. guepinii, and Drechslera sp., <25 íg/mL for A. alternata, and <30 íg/mL for F. aVenaceum (Table2). Higher levels of CPT more effectively inhibited mycelialgrowth, but the minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongthe fungi: approximately 75 íg/mL for A. alternata and E.nigrum, 100 íg/mL for Drechslera sp., 125 íg/mL for P.guepinii and F. aVenaceum. The flavonoids were less effectivethan the alkaloid CPT at 50 íg/mL, particularly during the firstthree weeks, but more effective than the alkaloid at g100 íg/mL during the whole experimental period. Maneb successfullycontrolled all fungi, while Bravo failed to completely suppressall tested fungi except P. guepinii. Both the alkaloid andflavonoids at all experimental concentrations were more potentin inhibiting Drechslera sp. and F. aVenaceum than Bravo, whilethe alkaloid at g50 íg/mL more effectively suppressed growthof A. alternata and E. nigrum than Bravo.The fungi varied in their sensitivity to the alkaloid, flavonoids,and fungicides. The leaf spot fungi A. alternata and E. nigrumgrew fast in control plates, but both were inhibited by CPT atrelatively low concentrations. P. guepinii, another fast-growingfungus associated with leaf spots, required higher concentrationsFigure 6. Effect of different concentrations of CPT, trifolin, hyperoside,Bravo, and Maneb on mycelial growth of F. avenaceum: CPT, 10 íg/mL(CPT-10), 30 íg/mL (CPT-30), 50 íg/mL (CPT-50), 70 íg/mL (CPT-70),100 íg/mL (CPT-100), 125 íg/mL (CPT-125), and 150 íg/mL (CPT-150); trifolin, 50 íg/mL (Trifolin-50), 100 íg/mL (Trifolin-100), and 150íg/mL (Trifolin-150); hyperoside, 50 íg/mL (Hyperoside-50), 100 íg/mL(Hyperoside-100), and 150 íg/mL (Hyperoside-150); Bravo, 10000 íg/mL; Maneb, 3000 íg/mL.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 1, 2005 35of CPT for complete inhibition. Drechslera sp. grew slowlyand were more sensitive to all tested chemicals than P. guepiniiand F. aVenaceum. F. aVenaceum was the slowest growingisolate but least sensitive to all chemicals at lower concentra-tions.Dithiocarbamates are organic fungicides commonly used forthe treatment of soil, seeds, and foliar and postharvest diseasesof some crops. Rafin et al. found that dithiocarbamates,including Maneb, N,N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid sodium salt,and some new synthetic compounds, inhibited growth ofFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini by 7-30% at 100 ppm (100íg/mL) (20). At the same concentrations CPT, trifolin, andhyperoside inhibited growth of the related fungal pathogen F.aVenaceum by 70% in vitro.CPT, trifolin, and hyperoside also showed more potentantifungal activity than some recently discovered natural anti-fungal products. As the most potent antifungal compound ofthe essential oils of 13 herbs selected by Sridhar et al., geraniolisolated from cymbopogan (Cymbopogan martini) inhibitedgrowth of Botrytis cinerea in both in vitro tests and TLCbioautography with an MIC of 160 íg/mL (21). Essential oilsof SalVia sclarea L. (Lamiaceae) inhibited growth of F.oxysporum f. sp. dianthi by 72% at 2000 íL/L (22). â-Asaronefrom rhizomes of Acorus gramineus Solander (Araceae) waseffective against mycelial growth of Alternaria mali (with MIC> 100 íg/mL) and F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (with MIC> 100 íg/mL) (23). Vanillin, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamal-dehyde, and (()-pinoresinol isolated from Melia azedarach L.(Meliaceae) controlled Fusarium Verticillioides at higher con-centrations (with MICs of 600, 400, and 1000 íg/mL, respec-tively) (24).Due to a dramatic increase in pathogen resistance to bothagrochemical and pharmaceutical fungicides, discovery of newantimicrobial compounds with new modes of action is becomingincreasingly important. CPT, trifolin, and hyperoside have morepotent antifungal activity than many newly discovered antifungalagents, including some fungicides on the market. CPTs arepotent inhibitors of the enzyme DNA topoisomerase I (1), whichhas not been previously targeted in fungicide development. Thus,CPTs with this unique mechanism of action, particularly somewater-soluble CPT analogues, should be further investigated asantifungal agents. The flavonoids trifolin and hyperoside areabundant in Camptotheca and some other plants. Although theirmechanisms of action against fungi are unknown, their ef-fectiveness, resource availability at low cost, and probable lowtoxicity to humans give the flavonoids potential as prototypesfor fungicides.Chemical Defense of C. acuminata. Two interesting patternswere observed upon correlation of concentrations of defensivecompounds and fungal pathogen distribution. First, C. acuminataplants can be infected by A. alternata, E. nigrum, P. guepinii,Drechslera sp., and F. aVenaceum, although the affected tissuesmay have concentrations of CPT and flavonoids much higherthan the MICs of these compounds against these fungi in vitro.For example, mature and old leaves have CPT concentrationsof at least 0.01-0.025% (on a fresh mass basis, equivalent to100-250 íg/mL) (7) but are frequently affected by leaf spots(A. alternata, E. nigrum, and P. guepinii). Trifolin and hypero-side may have contents 20 times higher than that of CPT; thus,the total content of all three antifungal compounds in thesemature and old leaves may reach 0.4-1.0% (on a fresh massbasis), approximately 40-100 times higher than their in vitroMICs. Clearly, the defense of CPT and flavonoids in plantscannot be measured by in vitro testing of isolates alone. On theother hand, however, fungal diseases are less serious in somehigher CPT yielding varieties and during seasons with higherCPT concentrations. Cultivars with higher CPT contents havefewer fungal problems. Fungal pathogens are less serious infast-growing seasons (May and June) with higher CPT contentsthan early spring or fall when tissues have much lower CPTconcentrations. From this point of view, resistance against fungalpathogens of plants can be improved by cultivar developmentand culture technology.CPT, trifolin, and hyperoside exhibit potent activity againstall five fungal pathogens isolated from C. acuminata in in vitroassays, but their antifungal activity in the plant is very limited.Further investigations on the balance of fungal infection andchemical defense are needed to understand this puzzle and toenhance alkaloidal biosynthesis in Camptotheca. In fact, aquestion about autotoxicity of CPTs in Camptotheca has neverbeen addressed. CPTs are potent inhibitors of DNA topo-isomerase and affect cell growth of almost all organisms, butwhy do CPTs not poison cells in living Camptotheca plants?The bioavailability of CPTs in plants may provide a startingpoint for further analysis to understand this question.ACKNOWLEDGMENTWe thank Dr. R.
