Abstract 
The stem bark of Ampelocera edentula 
Kuhlm. (Ulmaceae) is used by the Chimanes Indians 
from Bolivia for the treatment of cutaneous leish- 
maniasis caused by the protozoan Leishmania brazi- 
liensis. A chloroform extract of the stem barks was 
found to be active against extracellular forms of 
Leishmania ssp. and Trypanosoma cruzi at 50 ,ug/ml. 
Bioassay-guided fractionation of this extract allowed us 
to isolate one active compound. Its structure was elu- 
cidated by spectral and chemical studies as 4-hydroxy- 
1-tetralone. BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis 
(PH8) or L. venezuelensis were treated one day after the 
parasitic infection with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone (25 mg / 
kg/day) or with reference drug, GlucantimeO (56 mg 
Sb"/kg/day) for 14 days. Lesion development was the 
criteria used to evaluate the disease severity. 4-Hydro- 
xy-1-tetralone was slightly less effective than the refer- 
ence drug against L. amazonensis or L. venezuelensis. 
Single treatment near the site of infection, 14 days after 
infection with L. amazonensis, with 4-hydroxy-1-te- 
tralone (50 mg/kg) was more effective than Glucan- 
time (112mg/kg). This study is, to our knowledge, the 
first to show the activity of a tetralone for the experi- 
mental treatment of New World cutaneous leishmania- 
sis.

Introduction 
Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishma- 
niasis are protozoan diseases of the tropic and subtropic 
areas in South America, particularly in the subandean 
areas of the humid lowlands of Bolivia. In the endemic re- 
gions of Bolivia, the classic treatments are too expensive or 
unavailable for the population suffering from cutaneous 
leishmaniasis or espundia. In Bolivia, the Instituto Bo- 
liviano de Biologia de Altura (IBBA) and the French In- 
stitute of Scientific Research for the Development in Co- 
operation (ORSTOM) have initiated an original program of 
investigations on alternative compounds for the treatment 
of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We have collected and studied 
medicinal plants used by Chimane Indians as a specific 
treatment for the cutaneous leishmaniasis. In previous 
works, we have described the chemical and biological 
studies of two antileishmanial Chimane-plants, Pera be- 
nensis Rusby (Euphorbiaceae) (1) and Galipea longifora 
Krause (Rutaceae) (2). The aim of this study is to evaluate 
the leishmanicidal activity of another plant identified as 
Ampelocera edentula Kuhlm. (Ulmaceae). 
The stem bark in the form of a poultice is 
applied on the cutaneous lesions until complete cica- 
trization of the wound. In a preliminary screening, a chlo- 
roform acid extract of the stem barks of A. edentula dis- 
played an in vitro activity at 50 pg/ml against five strains of 
promastigote forms of Leishmania species and five strains 
of epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Activity- 
directed fractionation and purification of this crude extract 
of the stem barks afforded one active compound identified 
by its physical and spectral data as 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone 
(1). This work is devoted to the in vitro antileishmanial and 
trypanocidal activities and the in vitro activity of this te- 
tralone. We sought to verify its effect when administered 
directly in the rear footpad of mice infected with L. amazo- 
nensis.

Materials and Methods 
Isolation and chemistry 
General experimental procedures 
The UV spectrum was recorded on a Unicam SP 
1800 spectrophotometer; IR spectrum was measured in KBr with 
a Perkin Elmer 257 spectrophotometer, 'H and I3C-NMR spectra 
were recorded in CDC13 (6 ppm) on a Bruker AC 200 P 
spectrometer operating at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively. The EI- 
mass spectrum was obtained at 70 eV on a Nermag R 1010 C mass 
spectrometer. Silica gel GFZ54 (Alufolien 60 F 254 Merck 5554) and 
silica gel 60 H (Merck 7736) were used for TLC and CC, re- 
spectively. 
Plant material 
Stem bark of Ainpelocera edentula Kuhlm. was 
collected hy A. Fournet (A. F. 884) in September 1988 at Fatima de 
Chimane, in the Department of Beni, altitude 450m, Bolivia. The 
plant material has been identified by Dr. C. Todzia of the De- 
partment of Botany, University of Texas, Austin, USA. A reference 
specimen is deposited in the National Herbarium of Bolivia (La 
Paz). 
Extraction and isolation 
Stem barks (3 kg) of A. edentula were acidified 
with 0.5 N HC1 and extracted with chloroform. The crude extract 
(58g) was chromatographed on silica gel H (1.5kg) and eluted 
with a CHCl,-MeOH gradient. The active fraction (7.9 g) eluted with 
CHCl,-MeOH, 99/1, was further purified on silica gel H (240 g), fol- 
lowed by a column chromatography on Sephadex LH 20, using 
CHC13, MeOH, 7/3, as eluent. The active compound (0.87 g) was 
identified by its physical and spectral data as 4-liydroxy-l- 
tetralone (1).

Biological assays 
Parasites 
Cultures of Leishmania ssp. and Trypanosoma 
cruzi were obtained from IBBA (Instituto Boliviano de Biologia de 
Altura, La Paz) and identified by isoenzyme analysis. Five strains 
of Leishmania were used during these investigations: L. brazi- 
lieasis (MHOM/BR/75/M 29031, L. amazonensis (IFLA/BR/67/ 
PH8), L. amazonensis (MHOM/GF/84/CAY H-142), L. donouani 
(MHOM/IN/83/HS-70) and L. donouaiai (MHOM/Br/OO/M 2682) 
and five strains of Trypanosoma cruzi: SC 43 CL2 (Bolivian strain), 
C8 CL1 (Brazilian strain), Tulahuen (isolated from Triatoma in- 
festans in Brazil), TeCL2 (Brazilian strain) and 1979 CL1 (Bolivian 
strain). 
Culture and maintenance of the 
promastigote forms ofLeishmaizia ssp. 
and the spimastigote forms of 
Trypanosoma cruzi 
Cultures of the extracellular forms ofLeishmania 
ssp. and Trypanosoma cruzi were prepared and maintained as 
described previously (3, 4). 
I n  uivo studies 
Mice: Female and male BALB/c mice were sup- 
plied by the Charles Rivers Breeding Laboratory and were then 
bred in IBBA (Bolivia). Mice weighed between 18- 20 g and were 
eight weeks old when experiments were initiated. 
Parasites: The mouse footpad infection has been 
used as model for these experiments (5,6). 
Leishmania amazonensis MHOM/IFLA/BR/67/ 
PH8 and L. uenezuelensis MHOM/VE/74/PM-H3 were used. The 
source and history of these isolates have been previously de- 
scribed (7). All strains were maintained by passage every 6 to 8 
weeks in hamsters. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were infected sub- 
cutaneously in the right rear footpad with 1 X lo6 amastigotes 
obtained from donor hamsters. The parasites were delivered in 
200 pl phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 
The growth of lesions was determined weekly by 
measuring the diameter of both rear feet with a direct reading 
vernier caliper (Ref: Kroelin 10DI 00T6). The size of lesion, in 
millimeters (Index of Leishmaniasis), was calculated by sub- 
tracting measurements obtained from the uninfected foot from 
that of the infected foot. Measurements commenced one day prior 
to the inoculation of amastigotes and were continued for 8 or 9 
weeks. For each experiment, the mean and standard error of the 
mean (S.E.M.) were calculated. 
, '
Drug treatment 
N-Metliylglucamine antimonate (GlucantimeB) 
with a pentavalent antimony (Sb") content of 28 % by weight was 
purchased from the Rhône-Poulenc, France and was used as ref- 
erence drug. Two experiments were conducted. Mice in the first 
experiment were treated by the subcutaneous route. Glucantime@ 
was given at a dose of 56mg Sb"/kg daily and 4-hydroxy-l- 
tetralone at 25 mg/kg daily. This tetralone was dissolved in 40 pl of 
polysorbate (Tween 80, Prolabo) and GlucantimeB in PBS. Un- 
treated mice received PBS and Tween 80. Drug treatment com- 
menced one day after the inoculation of amastigotes and was con- 
tinued once daily for 14 days. 
In a second set of experiments, mice were 
treated directly on the infected rear footpad with a single 
treatment 14 days after the inoculation of parasites. In these ex- 
periments, mice were treated with Glucantimea at 112mg Sb'/kg 
and with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone at 50 mg/kg. 
Results 
In vitro effects on Leishmania ssp. and 
Trypanosoma cruzi 
After 48h incubation with 4-hydroxy-l- 
tetralone, the ICgo for five strains of promastigote forms of 
Leishmania was 10 pg/ml. For an easy comparison, results 
obtained in the presence of 4-hydroxy-l-tetralone, pent- 
amidine, and meglumine antimonate are presented to- 
gether in Table 1. 4-Hydroxy-1-tetralone was tested in 
vitro on five strains of epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma 
cruzi. The effects of this compound, nifurtimox, and benz- 
nidazole on the growth of T. cruzi are presented in Table 2. 
After 48 h, 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone showed an inhibitory ac- 
tivity on all strains, the ICgo was 10 pg/ml. Nifu-timox and 
benznidazole did not show any inhibitory activity against 
multiplication of epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi 
below 25 pg/ml.

The activity of 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone 
against experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by 
Leishmania amazonensis in BALB/c mice is presented in 
Fig. 1. The mice treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone and 
Glucantime developed similar lesion size after four weeks, 
1.1" and lmm,  respectively. We have observed an 
identical increase in the development of the lesion size in 
mice treated with 25 mg/kg of 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone daily 
or with 56mg Sb"/kg of GIucantime daily, respectively, 
1.2" and 1". Ëight weeks after infection, mice 
treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone had an average lesion 
size of 3.86 mm, this size was 3.28 mmin mice treated with 
the reference drug and 4.95 mm in the untreated mice. Pre- 
liminary toxicological eyaluations of 4-hydroxy- 1 -tetralone 
administered in BALB/c mice indicated that this drug had 
a therapeutic index with an acute intraperitoneal 50 % 
lethal dose of 168mg/kg. No apparent signs of drug 
toxicity, weight loss or hair loss, were observed in the ex- 
periments but an inflammatory effect was seen near the 
site of administration of drug. 
Treatments against L. venezuelensis 
The results obtained with this model are 
presented in Fig.2. Four weeks after infection, mice 
treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone or with the antimonial 
compound had an average lesion size of 1.28" and 
0.95mm, respectively, compared with 2.06" in un- 
treated mice. During the last four weeks of the experiment, 
we observed that the sizes of lesions were similar in mice 
treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone or reference drug, 
3.77" and 3.3mm, respectively. After eight weeks of 
experiment, the progression of the Leishmania uene- 
zuelensis infection was slower in mice treated with refer- 
ence drug than in mice treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone 
(respectively, 4.25 mm and 5.05 mm). 
Single treatments on the footpad in mice 
infected with Leishmania amazonensis 
PH8) 
In this experiment, the treatment with 4- 
hydroxy-1-tetralone was administered at the site of para- 
sitic infection, 14 days after infection with Leishmania 
amazonensis (PH8). The results obtained are shown in 
Fig. 3. We have observed a severe inflammatory effect in 
mice treated with 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone at 50 mg/kg. This 
inflammation was resorbed three weeks after the local 
treatment. Single treatment with 4-hydroxy-1 -tetralone (at 
50 mg/kg) reduced the severity of lesions in this model and 
appeared more effective than pentavalent antimony. Eight 
weeks after infection, mice treated with 4-hydroxy-l- 
tetralone had an average lesion size of 2.55 mm, compared 
to 2.85 mm in mice treated with Glucantime and 4.90" 
in untreated mice.

Discussion 
The bioassay guided fractionation of 
Ampelocera edentula led to one active compound iden- 
tified as the known product, 4-hydroxy-1-tetralone or 4- 
hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphthalenone. This product 
is considered as a metabolite from the degradation of 
naphthalene and l-napthol(8,9) and as an intermediate in 
the biosynthesis of 1,4-naphthoq~1inones (8). It was pre- 
viously encountered in fungi (10) and yeasts (11). It is also 
used as an intermediate in the synthesis of antibiotics (12). 
To our knowledge, this tetralone has been isolated here for 
the first time from higher plants. 
The evaluation of the in uivo anti- 
leishmanial activity of 4-hydroxy-1 -tetralone showed the 
efficacy of this compound. Results of the in uivo experi- 
ments indicated that all mice treated with 25mg of 4- 
hydroxy-1-tetralone per kg daily for 14 days developed a 
similar lesion size when compared with mice treated with 
the antimony drug. We observed that 4-hydroxy-l- 
tetralone, administered at 50mg/kg near the site of 
parasitic infection in Leishmania amazonensis infected

mice, is more effective than the antimony reference drug at 
112 mg/Sb"/kg. These results demonstrate that the tra- 
ditional use of Ampelocera edentula in endemic areas of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis together with our clinical obser- 
vations give excellent proof of the efficiency of 4-hydroxy- 
1 -tetralone. 
This class of compounds was previously 
described as antiprotozoal products (13- 161. These com- 
pounds generate free oxygen radicals within parasites 
which lack protective mechanisms against such radicals 
(17), particularly catalase (18). They are described as cyto- 
toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic for laboratory animals 
(19, 20). Some authors reported schistosomicidal activities 
of tetralones (21). 
This study confrms that the poultices of 
stem bark of Ampelocera edentula, as used by Chimane 
Indians, are effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis. 
This work describes the first example of activity of a 
tetralone against Leishmania species, but the use of 4- 
hydroxy-1 -tetralone as antileishmanial drug is critical be- 
cause of its high cytotoxicity. Studies of derived 4-
