O diterpeno glicosídico inédito, denominado vernanolídeo, possuindo o esqueleto geranil-
geraniol, foi isolado do caule de Cupania vernalis, uma espécie da família Sapindaceae, conhecida
popularmente como “arco de peneira”. A estrutura do diterpeno foi determinada por técnicas
espectrométricas, incluindo RMN mono e bidimensionais.
A new glucosyl diterpene possessing a geranyl-geraniol skeleton and named vernanolide was
isolated from a Sapindaceae plant species, Cupania vernalis, popularly named “arco de peneira”.
The structure of the isolated compound was determined by 1H, 13C NMR, MS, IR and 2D NMR
experiments.
Keywords: Sapindaceae, Cupania vernalis, diterpene glucoside
Introduction
Plant species of Sapindaceae are known for their
traditional medicinal uses as diuretic, stimulant, expectorant,
natural surfactant, sedative, vermifuge and against stomach-
ache and dermatitis in many parts of the world 1-4. In Brazil,
Paullinia cupana, popularly named “guaraná” is the most
representative plant species of this family. This plant is well
known for its stimulant properties and a soft drink prepared
from its fruits is an important article of Brazilian commerce.
The chemical investigation of this family has led to the
isolation of saponins4-6, diterpenes7-9, flavonoids10, among
other secondary metabolites11-14. Several saponins and acyclic
sesquiterpene and diterpene oligoglycosides have been
isolated as main secondary metabolites of several
Sapindaceae species used in traditional oriental medicine6, 15.
Cupania vernalis Camb., known as “camboatã”, “arco
de pipa” or “arco de peneira”, is a common small tree
growing from Minas Gerais to Rio Grande do Sul, mainly
in the Cerrado and gallery forest. This species was
investigated because the CHCl3 crude extract from its bark
proved to be active against all mutant strains of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad+, Rad 52Y and RS 321,
which suggests the presence of antifungal constituents. This
report describes the isolation and structure elucidation of
a new acyclic diterpene oligosaccharide (1), besides the
mixtures of the known sterols sitosterol, stigmasterol, 3--
D-glucosylsitosterol, 3--D-glucosylstigmasterol and the
coumarin scopoletin, this latter responsible for the moderate
activity against the mutant strains of S. cerevisiae detected
in the crude extract.
Experimental
General
Infrared spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer
spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200
or 300 MHz (Bruker AC 200 and AM 500 WB spectro-
meter, respectively); TMS was used as internal standard.
13C NMR spectra were recorded at 75 MHz. Mass spectra
were recorded at 70 eV on a Platform II spectrometer.
Optical rotation measurements were conducted on a
Polamat polarimeter using a quartz cuvete (length 10 cm).
Silica gel PF254 and silica gel (230-400 mesh) were used
for separation procedures. All solvents used were of
analytical or HPLC grade.
Plant material
Cupania vernalis was collected in Campininha Farm
Ecological Reserve, situated in Mogi-Guaçú, São Paulo

Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, São Paulo.
Extraction and isolation
Air-dried and powdered trunk bark (1.0 kg) was
repeatedly extracted with MeOH to afford MeOH crude
extract (80.0 g). Part of this extract (40.0 g) was dissolved
in aqueous MeOH (80%) and then submitted to liquid/
liquid partition with hexane, which gave a hexane fraction
(1.96 g) after concentration. The aqueous MeOH solution
was concentrated to 60% and then extracted with CHCl3
and n-BuOH affording the CHCl3 (3.70 g) and n-BuOH
(5.40 g) fractions, respectively, after concentration. The
CHCl3 fraction was submitted to gel filtration with gradient
elution on Sephadex LH-20, according to methodology
previously described16. Fifteen sub-fractions were obtained
and combined to give 10 fractions, after comparison by
TLC analysis. Flash chromatography was carried out with
the first combined fractions 1-5, which gave a mixture of
sitosterol/stigmasterol and 3--D-O-glucosylsitosterol/3-
-D-O-stigmasterol. Combined fractions 7-10 (1.70 g) were
further separated by silica gel column chromatography
(CHCl3/MeOH gradient) and subsequent prep. TLC (5%
MeOH/CHCl3), affording the bioactive coumarin
scopoletin (2) (10 mg) and the new diterpene 1 (15.5 mg).
Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless powder from
the stems of C. vernalis, collected at Campininha Farm,
Mogi-Guaçú, São Paulo State. The ES-MS data showed
the molecular ion at m/z 789 [M+Na]+ and four major
fragments at m/z 541, 525, 295 and 92. In addition, 1H and
13C NMR analyses indicated the presence of four acetyl
groups besides a disaccharide moiety and suggested the
molecular formula C40H62O14 for this compound. Analysis
of the IR spectral absorptions at 3450, 1720 and 1650 cm-1
suggested the presence of hydroxyl, ester carbonyl and
double bond functions, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum
of 1 (Table 1) showed a signal at  4.35 (2H, d, J 5.2 Hz)
for hydrogens of a _CH2O_ system probably linked to an
olefinic carbon and to a sugar moiety. In addition, this
spectrum showed two signals at  5.10 (3H, br t, J 5.0 Hz)
and  5.40 (1H, br t, J 5.2 Hz) for four hydrogens, each on
an olefinic carbon linked to a methylene group; and three
singlets at  1.59 (9H, s), 1.68 (3H, s), 1.69 (3H, s), assigned
to five methyl groups on sp2 carbons. These data suggested
an open chain terpene derived partial structure for
compound 1. The presence of four additional singlets at
 1.99, 2.03, 2.05 and 2.09 for methyl groups corroborated
the acetyl moieties in the proposed structure. The
observation of several signals at  3.20-4.28 for hydroxy-
methine and hydroxymethylene hydrogen atoms and at
 5.18 (1H, d, J 7.4 Hz) and 5.30 (1H, br s) for anomeric
hydrogen atoms, besides one doublet at  1.14 (3H, d, J
6.5 Hz) for one methyl group on an sp3 carbon, suggested
the presence of a glucose and a rhamnose unit linked to
the terpene moiety. Inspection of 13C NMR spectra (Table
1) indicated a great similarity with diterpene
geranylgeraniol 6. The comparison of all carbon values of 1
with those of geranylgeraniol led us to establish the aglycone
skeleton of diterpene 1. Furthermore, two signals for
anomeric carbons at  97.8 and 100.1, eight signals for
hydroxymethine carbons at  77.8, 77.0, 69.8, 69.4, 73.5,
70.9, 70.1, 66.3, signals for one hydroxymethylene carbon at
 64.7 and one methyl group at  17.0, besides signals at
 171.6, 170.7, 170.4, 169.8 for four carbonyl groups and
at  21.1, 20.9, 20.8, 20.7 for four methyl groups suggested
the presence of a tetra-acetylglucosyl-rhamnopyranosyl
moiety attached at C-1 of diterpene 1. These spectral
features were in agreement with data obtained from the
ES-MS spectrum, which showed major ions at m/z 789,
541, 277, 295 and 92 assigned to [M+Na]+, [789-
diacetylrhamnosyl+Na]+, [541-diacetylglucosyl+Na]+,
[geranylgeraniol-H2O+Na]+ and [dimethylallyl+Na]+,
respectively. The sequential loss of rhamnose and then
glucose moieties confirms the presence of a disaccharide
chain linked to the aglycone geranylgeraniol with rhamnose
being the terminal sugar. The exact sequence of the
disaccharide and its linkage to the aglycone, as well as the
positions of each acetyl group on the sugar units, were
solved by extensive use of 2D NMR spectroscopic
techniques aided by the analysis of chemical shifts
described in the literature6, 15. The COSY 1H-1H spectrum
of 1 enabled quite extensive hydrogen couplings to be
verified, as the strong correlation of signals at  5.40 and
 4.35, assigned to H-2 and H-1, respectively. This spectrum
also evidenced the correlation between signals at  2.05
and 1.98, which were assigned to methylene hydrogens at
415New Tetra-acetylated Oligosaccharide Diterpene from Cupania vernalisVol. 12, No. 3, 2001
C-4, C-8, C-12 and C-5, C-9, C-13, respectively, after
analysis of additional data from the HETCOR spectrum.
Additionally, these data confirmed the positions of each
methyl group on the diterpene unit and the methyl signal
at  1.14 corresponding to C-6" ( 17.0) of the rhamnosyl
unit. Based on such spectral evidence, compound 1 was
shown to contain four acetyl groups and a -D-
glucopyranosyl--L-rhamnopyranoside linked at C-1 of the
aglycone geranylgeraniol. The positions of the acetyl units
at each sugar moiety, the detailed sugar arrangement and
the linkages between the sugar and the aglycon were
determined from HMBC experiments (Figure 1) with the
same conclusions regarding the sugar sequence drawn from
the NOESY experiment (Table 1). The signal at  63.4
attributed to C-1 showed HMBC correlation to the signal
at  5.40, attributed to the olefinic hydrogen H-2, and to
the anomeric hydrogen at  5.18, and confirmed that the
glucosyl unit is linked to the diterpene skeleton. The HMBC
correlation between the broad singlet at  5.30, attributed
to the anomeric hydrogen of the terminal rhamnosyl unit
and the carbon signals at  77.8 (C- 3'), 69.8 (C- 2") and
73.5 (C-5"), respectively, established a (13) linkage
between the two sugar units. Further correlations between
the hydrogen signal at  4.28 (H-6') to carbon signals at

 66.3 (C-5'), 64.7 (C-6') and 169.8 (CH3COO-C-6') led to
the definition of the acetyl position at the sugar moiety in
the diterpene molecule. The NOESY experiments also
showed significant interactions among hydrogens and
permitted us to assign the relative stereochemistry on the
basis of coupling constants (Table 1) and corroborated the
proposed structure for compound 1.
