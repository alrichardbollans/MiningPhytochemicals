A computational study has predicted 1 to be a reproductive toxicant in mammals and issuggestive that use of 1 may be associated with adverse effects. We report in this study thatpiperidine 21 and thiomorpholine 23 have been identified as selective partial agonists at kappaopioid receptors. This indicates that additional structural modifications of 1 may provide ligandswith good selectivity for opioid receptors but with reduced potential for toxicity.IntroductionThe neoclerodane diterpene, salvinorin A (1), is the main active component of thehallucinogenic mint plant Salvia divinorum.1, 2 Lately, salvinorin A - containing productshave become increasingly available and self-administration of these products has beenreported.3–6 Historically, S. divinorum has been used medicinally by the Mazatecs ofOaxaca, Mexico for several conditions, but its mode of action was only recently discovered.7 Studies indicate that 1 has high affinity and activity at κ opioid (KOP) receptors, and hasno affinity for the molecular targets of other hallucinogenic substances such 5-HT2, C B1/CB2, NMDA, or muscarinic receptors.8 Furthermore, 1 appears to have unique properties asa ligand at KOP receptors, including ultra-high efficacy in particular transduction systems,and a reduced propensity to cause receptor desensitization.9, 10A growing number of experimental studies have explored the effects of 1 in animals.11–21For example, 1 was found to substitute for KOP agonist U69,593 but did not substitute forDOM in DOM-trained non-human primates.19, 20 This suggests that the hallucinogenicexperience elicited by 1 is qualitatively different than that of classical hallucinogens such asDOM. In rodents, 1 has been found to decrease striatal dopamine overflow and block thelocomotor effects of cocaine.16, 18 These findings provide further evidence for the potentialutility of 1 and related analogues as stimulant abuse therapeutics.22It is relatively rare for natural products, such as 1, to have sufficiently attractive ADME/Tox(Absorption, Disposition, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties to be marketable,Fax: +1-785-864-5326; Tel: +1-785-864-3267, prisinza@ku.edu.NIH Public AccessAuthor ManuscriptOrg Biomol Chem.

ADME/Tox has become integrated into thedrug discovery process and is a tremendous asset in guiding selection and optimization.23, 24Thus, the ability to improve these properties by semi- or total synthetic chemistry isimportant in drug seeking campaigns.Generally, furan-containing natural products, such as 1, are of limited medicinal value. Thisresults from their potential for toxicity after bioactivation.25–27 For instance, previous workhas shown that teucrin A (2), a neoclerodane present in germander (Teucrium chamaedrysL.; Lamiaceae), has the ability to produce hepatotoxicity.28 This results from the formationof an enedial formed from the metabolism of the furan ring by cytochrome P450 enzymes(CYP450s).29, 30 The resulting enedial is then capable of reacting with peptides to formstable conjugates.29 Using a proteomic analysis, the major targets of 2 were found to bemitochondrial and ER-associated proteins and enzymes involved in small moleculemetabolism and cell maintenance.30 Aflatoxin B1 (3), a difurano-containing natural productproduced by Aspergillus species, is a known hepatic carcinogen. Bioactivation of aflatoxinB1 by CYP450s is thought to involve a similar dial intermediate to the one formed from 2.31As a furan-containing natural product, 1 also has the potential to form reactive metabolitesresulting from bioactivation by CYP450s. This hampers its further development as apotential stimulant abuse therapeutic.32One approach to circumventing the potential toxicity of a furan-containing natural product isto explore different structural replacements for the furan ring. Ideally, these modificationsshould have low to no potential for toxicity but retain affinity and activity at opioidreceptors. Previously, we found that modification of the furan ring of 1 resulted inneoclerodanes that possessed reduced affinity and efficacy at opioid receptors.33–35 Theseprevious findings, as well as a recent report,36 suggested that additional structuralmodifications of 1 may lead to analogues with higher potency and potential utility as drugabuse medications. Here, we report our efforts to identify furan modified neoclerodanes withaffinity and activity at KOP receptors.Results and DiscussionInitially, a computational toxicological study (MC4PC, MultiCASE, Inc.) was performed on1 and three structurally similar compounds (columbin,37 diosbulbin G,38 and salvinorin B2)identified using the Derwent World Index and Prous Integrity databases. The results of thisinvestigation found that at pre-clinical endpoints 1 is predicted to be a reproductive toxicantin mammals (rabbits, rats, and mice). This suggests that 1 may have adverse effectsassociated with its use. However, there are few experimentally determined reports on thetoxicological effects of 1. A limited study in mice found that 1 produced no histologicaldifferences in control animals in the liver, spleen, kidney bone marrow, or brain tissue.39However, more detailed studies on the potential toxicological effects of 1 are warranted.Given the strong likelihood that the potential adverse effects of 1 are due to the presence ofthe furan ring, we sought to find other structural motifs that could potentially mimic thefuran at its binding site. While a model has been proposed for the binding of 1 to the KOP,40, 41 the binding pocket of 1 will not be known definitively until the structure of a KOP – 1complex is solved. Given the lack of these published studies, other indirect methods areneeded to more fully elucidate the nature of binding of 1 at the KOP receptor. Our approachwas to systematically change the structure of the position corresponding to the furan ringand probe its effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity.We initially targeted amide and ester derivatives due to their relative ease of synthesis,potential for reduced toxicity, and, likely improved water solubility. Our design strategySimpson et al. Page 2Org Biomol Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 January 21.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptconsisted of two parts: (1) the carbonyl of the amide or ester might participate in a hydrogenbonding interaction similar to the furanyl oxygen; and (2) enhanced affinity and/or activitymight result from the addition of a suitable group off the amide or ester bond. Our results aredescribed herein.ChemistryThe synthesis of analogues 5 – 30 and 34 – 37 is outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Salvinorin A(1) was extracted from commercially available S. divinorum leaves as described previously.42 The treatment of 1 with NaIO4 and a catalytic amount of RuCl3 afforded key intermediate4.33 The coupling of acid 4 with the appropriate aniline or alkylamine using EDCI inCH2Cl2 afforded analogues 5 – 30 in 18 – 75 % yield.The treatment of acid 4 with CDMT and N-methylmorpholine followed by ethanethiolafforded thioester 31 in 88% yield.43–46 The reduction of 31 with triethylsilane and Pd/Cgave aldehyde 32 in 82% yield.47 Asymmetric allylation of aldehyde 32 was accomplishedin 50% yield with B-allyl-(10S)-(trimethylsilyl)-9-borabicyclo[3.3.2]decane (prepared in situfrom 9-[(1R,2R)-pseudoephedrinyl]-(10S)-(trimethylsilyl)-9-borabicyclo[3.3.2]decane andallylmagnesium bromide.48 To determine the absolute stereochemistry of alcohol 33a,mosher ester 33b was prepared in 82% yield using oxalyl chloride and (R)-(+)-α-methoxy-α-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid.49 NMR analysis of 33b and its (S)-epimer made from theS-acid, was not definitive as to the configuration of the stereocenter. Therefore, X-rayanalysis of 33b was conducted and established the correct relative stereochemistry; theabsolute configuration was then assigned using the known stereochemistry for much of themolecule.Acylation of 33a with acryloyl chloride under basic conditions gave the corresponding esterwhich was then treated with 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst to afford 5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one 34 in 23% yield for the two steps.50,51 The reaction of 4 with either (2-hydroxybenzyl)triphenyl-or (2-thiobenzyl)triphenyl-phosponium bromide afforded thebenzofuran (35) and benzothiophene (36), respectively.52 Finally, coupling of the acid 4with N-hydroxybenzene-carboximidamide using EDCI followed by cyclization afforded 4-phenyl-1,3,5-oxadiazole 37.34BiologyCompounds 1, 5 – 30, and 34 – 37 were then evaluated for affinity at human opioidreceptors using methodology previously described (Table 1).53 As mentioned earlier, we andothers have found previously that modification of the furan ring of 1 resulted in alteredaffinity and activity at opioid receptors.33, 34, 36 These findings suggested that furthermodification to the furan ring may result in analogues with improved potency and potentialas drug abuse medications. To further elucidate the structure-activity relationships ofneoclerodane diterpenes at opioid receptors, we synthesized an additional series of furanmodified analogues.Our initial modification was to replace the furan ring in 1 with an anilido group (5). It wasenvisioned that the benzene ring would participate in a hydrophobic interaction similar tothe furan ring and the amide group could participate in a hydrogen bonding interaction. Thismodification was not well tolerated and affinity was lost at opioid receptors (Ki > 10,000nM). The reasons for this loss in affinity were not readily apparent. One potential reason forthis loss in affinity was the flexibility of the aromatic ring relative to the amide bond. Toaddress this issue, we synthesized indoline 6 as a more conformationally restricted analogueof 5. This change, however, did not enhance affinity suggesting that either the conformationwas not optimal or that alkylation of the aniline portion was not tolerated. Another potentialSimpson et al. Page 3Org Biomol Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 January 21.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptreason for the lack of affinity of 5 is the presence of the aromatic ring. Thus, we preparedcyclohexane 7 and cyclopentane 8. Replacement of the phenyl ring in 5 with these saturatedsystems resulted in a greater than 10-fold and 5-fold increase in affinity at KOP receptors,respectively. The replacement of the phenyl ring with a 3-pyridine (9) was not tolerated.Recent molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that theoxygen in the furan ring present in 1 forms a critical hydrogen bond with Y119 at the KOPreceptor.40, 41, 54, 55 This suggested to us that the inclusion of a hydrogen bond acceptorgroup to anilide 5 may enhance affinity at KOP receptors. Unfortunately, this designstrategy met with little success. Generally, the addition of a methoxy group to 5 (10 – 16)did not increase affinity for opioid receptors. Interestingly, 12 and 13 were found to haveweak affinity for MOP and DOP receptors and no affinity for KOPs. To further explore therole of electronics in the binding of these compounds to opioid receptors, we preparedbrominated analogues 17 – 19. Surprisingly, 17 – 19 possessed affinity at MOP receptors.This suggests that the furan ring may also have a role in determining the selectivity foropioid receptors. However, other modifications will need to be explored to further define therole of the furan ring in opioid receptor selectivity. In addition, these findings suggested thatthese compounds, while similar in structure to 1, may be interacting with opioid receptors ina different manner.We also explored additional structural modifications of the furan. The replacement of thefuran ring in 1 with a 5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one (34) was found to greatly reduce affinityfor KOPs. This molecule was prepared as a potential neoclerodane based affinity label.However, its low affinity for KOPs greatly hampers it potential utility in this capacity. Otherstructural modifications may lead to more useful pharmacological tools to better characterizethe interactions of neoclerodanes with opioid receptors. Replacement of the furan with a 2-benzofuran (35) greatly decreases affinity for KOPs compared to 1. However, thismodification had little effect on MOP affinity but enhanced affinity for DOP receptors.Interestingly, bioisosteric replacement of the 2-benzofuran (35) with a 2-benzothiophene(36) resulted in similar affinity for MOPs and DOPs but led to a loss in affinity for KOPs (Ki> 10,000 nM). Similar results were seen when the 2-benzofuran was replaced with a 4-phenyl-1,3,5-oxadiazole (37). This is in agreement with recent findings of Beguin et al.36However, 37 was found to have affinity for MOP receptors (Ki = 1,610 nM).Given the increased affinity of 7 and 8 for KOPs relative to 5, we explored additionalnonaromatic substitutions. First the cyclohexylamine moeity of 7 was contracted into apiperidine ring (21). This change resulted in a 9-fold increase in affinity for KOP receptorsrelative to 7 (Ki = 140 nM vs. Ki = 1220 nM). Replacement of the piperidine ring with apyrrolidine ring (22) resulted in a 9-fold loss in affinity (Ki = 1,210 M vs. Ki = 140 nM).Given this interesting result, we decided to further probe the role of piperidine ring in 21.Replacement of piperidine ring with either a morpholine ring (20) or a thiomorpholine ring(23) was well tolerated but did not further enhance affinity for KOP receptors. Addition of a4-bromo group to the piperidine ring (24) resulted in a 9-fold loss in affinity. This suggeststhat substitution in this position is not well tolerated. However, additional modificationsneed to be explored to further substantiate this finding.Previously, we showed that the tetrahydrofuran analogue of 1 retained high affinity for KOPreceptors.34 Based on this finding, we prepared several additional tetrahydrofurans.Unfortunately, this strategy also met with little success. The insertion of an amide linkage(25 – 27) resulted in a loss in affinity at KOP receptors. Surprisingly, 25 was found to havelow affinity DOP receptors (Ki = 3,090 nM). This is interesting because this is the firstreport of a neoclerodane with some selectivity for DOPs. Its modest affinity augers for theidentification of other neoclerodanes with enhanced affinity for DOPs. The insertion of anSimpson et al. Page 4Org Biomol Chem. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 January 21.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptester linkage (28 – 30) was better tolerated but did not result in high affinity agents. Thehighest affinity compound in this series identified was bicycle 28 (Ki = 610 nM).Compounds 21 and 23 were then evaluated for functional activity at KOP receptors using a[35S]GTP-γ-S assay (Table 2).53 Despite their affinity in the 100 nM range, 21 and 23 werefound to be approximately 100-fold less active than 1 as agonists. However, the replacementof the furan ring with a piperidino or thiomorpholinocarbonyl group was found to reduceefficacy at KOP receptors. This suggests that additional structural modifications may lead toanalogues with enhanced activity and reduced efficacy.ConclusionsIn summary, we have evaluated 30 furan ring modified analogues of 1 for opioid receptoraffinity. This manuscript reports the first salvinorin A analogue with some selectivity forDOP receptors (25). This suggests the likelihood of identifying other diterpenes with thischaracteristic from natural sources. Piperidine 21 and thiomorpholine 23 were found to beselective partial agonists at KOPs. However, they are less potent than 1. Furthermore, this isthe first report to discuss the potential toxicological concerns with the use of 1. Additionalstructural modifications of 1 are currently being explored and will be reported in due course.Experimental sectionUnless otherwise indicated, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and areused without further purification.

A fullhemisphere of diffracted intensities (1850 10-second frames with an ω scan width of 0.30°)was measured for a single-domain specimen using graphite-monochromated MoKαradiation (λ= 0.71073 Å; fine-focus sealed x-ray tube) on a Bruker SMART APEX CCDSingle Crystal Diffraction System. A total of 18602 integrated reflection intensities having2θ((MoKα)<61.00° were produced using the Bruker program SAINT; 9099 of these wereunique and gave Rint = 0.048 with a coverage which was 98.6% complete. The data werecorrected empirically for variable absorption effects using equivalent reflections. The Brukersoftware package SHELXTL was used to solve (direct methods) and refine (weighted full-matrix least-squares) the structure with Fo2 data.The three ethylenic hydrogens were located from a difference Fourier and included in thestructural model as independent isotropic atoms. The remaining hydrogen atoms wereincluded in the structural model as idealized atoms (assuming sp2- or sp3-hybridization ofthe carbon atoms and C-H bond lengths of 0.95 – 1.00 Å) with isotropic thermal parametersfixed at values 1.2 (nonmethyl) or 1.5 (methyl) times the equivalent isotropic thermalparameter of the carbon atom to which they are covalently bonded. The final structuralmodel incorporated anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydrogen atoms and isotropicthermal parameters for all hydrogen atoms. A total of 432 parameters were refined using 1restraint and 9099 data. Final agreement factors at convergence are: R1(unweighted, basedon F) = 0.045 for 8245 independent absorption-corrected “observed” reflections having2θ(MoKα)<61.00° and I>2σ(I); R1(unweighted, based on F) = 0.049 and wR2(weighted,based on F2) = 0.109 for all 9099 independent absorption-corrected reflections having2θ(MoKα)<61.00°. The final difference map had maxima and minima of 0.51 and −0.22 e−/Å3, respectively. The Flack parameter [0.0(4)] did not allow the absolute configuration to beestablished directly from the X-ray analysis and this was assigned using the knownstereochemistry for much of the molecule.
