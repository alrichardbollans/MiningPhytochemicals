ABSTRACI
Analysis of extracts from 6300 (1.2 grams fresh weight) Phaseolus
coccineus suspensors by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry has demonstrated the presence of five C,9-gibberellins, GA,, GA*,
GA5, GA6, GA8, and one C20-GA, GA44. The major GAs present were
GA, and GA8. Data are discussed in relation to previous results obtained
in P. coccineus seed as well as in the embryo-suspensor system.
The suspensor of-Phaseolus coccineus is produced by repeated
division of the basal cell resulting from the division ofthe zygote
(the apical cell will form the embryo-proper). The vital role of
the suspensor during embryogenesis was first demonstrated by
Corsi (7). Studies performed with the P. coccineus embryo sus-
pensor system cultivated in vitro showed that the early embryo
died when deprived of suspensor (10). Recently, Yeung (16)
showed that the suspensor is directly'involved in translocating
the nutrients to the embryo. These results are in direct accord-
ance with the structural studies (18) because, at the heart stage
of embryo development, the suspensor of P. coccineus has a
transfer cell morphology. The synthesis of hormones, an impor-
tant physiological function, hypothetically attributed to the sus-
pensor (11, 14) was confirmed by work on gibberellins by Cec-
carelli et al. (5).
The embryo cultured technique (6, 17) shows that the suspen-
sor may provide gibberellins to the young embryo during early
development. Alpi et al. (2) found high levels of GA-like sub-
stances in the embryo proper and in the suspensor ofP. coccineus
at the heart shaped embryo and cotyledonary embryo stages;
afterwards, GA, was identified in the suspensor at the early stage
(3).
The presence of GA-like substances was recently ascertained
in massive suspensors of two other species: Tropaeolum majus
L. and Cytisus laburnum L. (13). In this paper we report the
amount and the type of gibberellins present in suspensors of
stage B (initial degenerative stage) of P. coccineus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material. Phaseolus coccineus suspensors were removed
under a stereoscopic microscope from seeds 12 mm long (re-
ported as stage B) (2) immediately after being collected. Collec-
tion was carried out during two consecutive seasons (1983-84).
All material was kept in an ice bath during the isolation of
suspensors from the seeds; the suspensors were stored at -20°C.
Extraction and Purification. Frozen suspensors (6300, 1.2 g
f.w.2) were homogenized in cold 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol
and stirred for 12 h at 4°C before centrifugation at 2500g for 10
' Supported by M.P.I. 40%, Italy.

min. The residue was reextracted twice. The combined filtrates
were reduced to the aqueous phase and the pH adjusted to 2.5
with HCl. The aqueous phase was then partitioned five times
against ethyl acetate and the ethyl acetate extract was dried
(MgSO4), filtered, and reduced to a small volume. The ethyl
acetate extract was adsorbed onto a small quantity of silica-gel
for silica-gel partition chromatography, which was carried out as
previously described (3). After 54 fractions were collected, the
column was washed with methanol (2 x 20 ml); the methanol
fractions are referred to as C, and C2.
Bioassay. Dwarf-rice (Oryza saliva L., cv Tan-ginbozu) and
barley endosperm a-amylase (Hordeum vulgare L., cv Himalaya)
were used for detecting GA-like activity.
Analytical and Preparative Gas Chromatography. The frac-
tions containing activity were collected, pooled, evaporated, and
the residue was transferred to a capillary tube, dried thoroughly,
and trimethylsilylated with a mixture of pyridine-hexamethyldi-
silazane-trimethylchlorosilane (10:2:2, v/v/v). The derivatized
samples were analyzed on a Pye-Unicam 104 gas chromatograph
equipped with a dual F.I.D. A glass column (150 cm x 0.4 cm
i.d.) packed with 3% OV-1 on Chromosorb Q (100-200 mesh)
was used. The carrier gas (N2) flow rate was 40 ml min-' and a
temperature column program of 200 to 300C at 6C min-'. A
portion of the column eluate (70%) was collected using a micro-
preparative attachment for preparative analysis. The remainder
was detected by the F.I.D. The trapped samples were washed
with water at pH 2.5 and then with ethyl acetate to hydrolyze
the TMS derivative prior to bioassay.
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. GC-MS spectra
were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5992 B equipped with a jet
separator and operating at 70 eV. GC conditions were as follows:
column (90 cm x 0.2 cm i.d.) 2% OV-1; carrier gas, He at 25 ml
min-'; oven temperature program of 200 to 300C at 4C min-'.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Using the a-amylase bioassay, three major zones of activity
were observed: fraction 17-22, 25-27, 35-40 (Fig. 1A). Only two
major zones of activity were observed when the dwarf-rice bioas-
say was used: fractions 17-27 and 35-38 (Fig. 1B). The fractions
17-22, 23-28, and 35-40 named SB,, SB2, and SB3 (Fig. 1A)
respectively, were combined, silylated, and analyzed by analytical
and preparative GC. Gibberellin-like activities were located in
the preparative GC trace by a-amylase bioassay ofthe hydrolyzed
(see "Materials and Methods") TMSi occurring in individual
peaks. GC-MS analysis of the biologically active peak from
sample SB, gave spectra with all the characteristic ions and
retention times of TMSi-TMSi GA5 and GA4 standards (Table
I).
The GC scans of the two biologically active peaks of sample
SB2 gave spectra similar to those obtained in our previous work
(12) on P. coccineus cotyledonary embryos and are reported in
Table II. These peaks were trapped by preparative GC followed
by hydrolysis of the TMSi. The resulting samples were methyl-
ated with ethereal diazomethane and silylated. GC-MS analysis
of these peaks (Table III) as Me-TMSi gave one spectrum iden-

be made due to the lack of internal standards. Therefore, esti-
mates were made by comparing the GC peak areas with those
obtained from GC traces of several standard (GA,, GA4, GA5,
GA8) run under identical conditions. Table V reports the amount
of different gibberellins identified in the suspensors of stage B
compared to embryos reported in previous work (12).
The results reported above represent the first clear evidence of
the presence of other native gibberellins (GA4, GA5, GA6, GA8,
GA44) besides GA,, in suspensors (stage B) of P coccineus.
Previous results (5) have demonstrated the synthesis of three C,9-
GAs (GA1, GA5, GA8) in suspensor cell-free extracts of P. cocci-
neus seeds; the present data confirm the presence of these and
other native gibberellins in suspensor. Under the same cell-free
experimental conditions no accumulation of C20 gibberellins was
found, but these new data show that at least GA44 is present in
this tissue. The quantitative data presented in Table V show that

both tissues (embryo and suspensor) contain a very high concen-
tration of gibberellins. The embryo has one of the highest levels
of gibberellins found in plant organs (10); however the level of
these hormones in the suspensor is almost 10-fold that of the
embryo. Of all the biologically active gibberellins identified, GAI
is the highest in concentration. Furthermore, a great accumula-
tion of the biologically inactive GA8 has been shown (8).
Recently, Albone et al. (1) described the localization of GAs
in embryos and testas of developing P. coccineus seeds. In this
work (1) the authors reported that GA8, a putative conjugate of
GA8, and a GA8 catabolite, accumulate in the testa ofP. coccineus
and Sechium edule. They also suggested that the testa is the
primary site for the formation of Ga8-glucoside. Our data show
massive accumulation of GA8 in suspensors of stage B. This
structure is probably a component of P. coccineus testa analyzed
by Albone et al. (1). Table V shows that GA8 was not identified
in embryos of stage B; this result confirms that of Albone et al.
(1).

GA12-aldehyde was converted to 13 gibberellins and GA8 was
identified by GC-MS but had no detectable '4C-labeling. There-
fore, while embryo tissue may not to be able to synthesize GA8,
suspensor cell-free systems have been shown (5) to produce it.
