dehydration. The liberation of '4CO2 when un-
labelled glyoxylate and [1,3-14C2]acetoacetate were
incubated together (Table 5) is proof that the
decarboxylation of the initial product can occur at
neutral pH, and explains the increase in 14CO2
production by rat-liver slices in the presence of
glyoxylate and [1-14C]octanoate (Table 3).
The reaction between acetoacetate and glyoxyl-
ate probably has no physiological importance
since the normal concentration of glyoxylate
occurring in vivo is very low (e.g. in rat liver:
0 05 pumole/100 mg. dry wt.; Liang, 1962). How-
ever, the condensation reaction reported here is of
interest as an explanation of the apparent anti-
ketogenic action of glyoxylate and its metabolic
precursors glycollate and glycolaldehyde.
SUMMARY
1. Glycolaldehyde, glycollate and glyoxylate,
but not formate or glycine, decrease the amount of
acetoacetate formed by rat-liver slices.
2. Incubation of glyoxylate and acetoacetate in
neutral solution at 370 results in a stoicheiometric
removal of the two acids and the reaction is
accelerated by Mg2+ ions.
3. A product of this condensation reaction has
been isolated and characterized as f-acetylacrylic
acid (4-oxopent-2-enoic acid).
4. It is suggested that the apparent antiketo-
genic action of glyoxylate (and also of glycol-
aldehyde and glycollate) is due to its non-enzymic
condensation with acetoacetate.

The Isolation of y-Hydroxyarginine, as its Lactone, from Seeds of Vicia
sativa, and the Identification of y-Hydroxyornithine as a Naturally
Occurring Amino Acid
BY E. A. BELL AND A. S. L. TIRIMANNA
Department of Biochemistry, King's CoUege, London, W.C. 2
(Received 26 September 1963)
The natural amino acid y-hydroxyarginine was
first isolated from the sea cucumber Polycheira
rufe8cen8 by Fujita (1959) and subsequently from
the sea anemone Anthopleura japonica Verrill by
Makisumi (1961). Its occurrence in plants too has
been reported by Bell & Tirimanna (1963a), who
identified it in the seeds of 17 species of Vicia.
The present paper describes its isolation, as the
lactone, from seeds of Vicia 8ativa, and the identifi-
cation of y-hydroxyornithine in other species.
EXPERIMENTAL
Methods
Chromatography. One-dimensional chromatograms were
prepared by the descending technique on Whatman no. 1
paper. The chromatograms were developed with ethyl
methyl ketone-propionic acid-water (2:1:2, by vol.),
butan-l-ol-acetic acid-water (12:3:5, by vol.), butan-l-
ol-pyridine-water (1:1:1, by vol.), lutidine (mixed 2,4-
and 2,5-isomers)-water (11: 5, v/v), and phenol-water
HYDROXY AMINO ACIDS IN VICIA
(4:1, w/v) in the presence of the vapour from aq. ammonia
(sp.gr. 0.88) added to the tank. Chromatograms were
developed for 17 hr. except where otherwise stated.
Ionophoresis. Ionophoresis was conducted on Whatman
no. 1 paper in buffer solutions of pH 1-9 [formic acid
(98-100%)-acetic acid-water (33:148:1819, by vol.)], of
pH 3-6 [acetic acid-pyridine-water (10:1:190, by vol.)]
and ofpH 11-6 (sodium carbonate, 0-01 M). With the buffers
of lower pH a horizontal method essentially that of Gross
(1961) was used, a potential of 75 v/cm. being applied for
30 min. At pH 11-6 a hanging-strip method was used,
5 v/cm. being applied for 17 hr.
Development ofcolnor8. Chromatography and ionophoresis
papers were dipped in ninhydrin reagent [0-2% (w/v)
ninhydrin in 95% (v/v) acetone], the modified Ehrlich's
reagent [1-0% (w/v) p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in
acetone-10N-hydrochloric acid (9:1, v/v)] of Smith (1953)
and the modified Sakaguchi's reagent [0C1% (v/v) 8-
hydroxyquinoline in acetone followed by 0-2% (v/v)
bromine in 0-5N-sodium hydroxide] of Jepson & Smith
(1953). Ninhydrin colours were developed at 800.
Detection of y-hydroxyarginine. y-Hydroxyarginine was
detected as a ninhydrin-positive compound giving a scarlet
colour with Sakaguchi's reagent which was distinguishable
from the orange-red colour given by arginine. These two
amino acids could also be readily separated by paper
chromatography with the ethyl methyl ketone-propionic
acid-water, butan-l-ol-acetic acid-water and phenol-water
solvents.
Isolation of y-hydroxyarginine lactone
Finely ground seed of Vicia sativa (1600 g.) was extracted
with acetone for 24 hr. and with methanol for 48 hr. in a
modified Soxhlet apparatus. The defatted seed was then
shaken for 2 hr. with 1-5 1. of 25% (v/v) ethanol and the
suspension filtered after 17 hr. at room temperature. The
residue was again extracted in the same manner and the
combined extracts were concentrated to 1 1. under reduced
pressure. The concentrate was passed through a column
(3 cm. x 80 cm.) of De-Acidite FF, a strong anion-exchange
resin, which was then washed with water until the effluent
was neutral and gave no reaction with ninhydrin. The
alkaline effluent and combined washings were passed
through a column (3 cm. x 50 cm.) of Zeo-Karb 226, a weak
cation-exchange resin, which was washed as described
above for the De-Acidite FF column.
The basic amino acids were eluted from the Zeo-Karb 226
resin with N-ammonia, and the fractions giving a positive
reaction with Sakaguchi's reagent were combined and
concentrated in vacuo at room temperature over CaCl2 and
H2SO4. The viscous residue was dissolved in water (10 ml.)
and the solution acidified to pH 4 by the dropwise addition
of 11 N-HCl. The acidified solution was stirred with acti-
vated charcoal, filtered and concentrated to 5 ml. at 1000.
On adding excess of ethanol to the concentrate an oil
separated; after 17 hr. at 40, the ethanol was decanted and
the oil stirred in warm fresh ethanol to which water was
added dropwise until solution was complete. On standing
at 40 colourless needles separated from the solution and
were recrystallized from aq. ethanol in the same way. The
purified material (57 mg.) had m.p. 158° (uncorr.) (Found:
C, 27-7; H, 6-2; Cl, 26-4; N, 20-4; loss at 1100, 7+1. Cale.
for C,H12N402,2HCl,H20: C, 27-4; H, 6-1; Cl, 26-6; N, 21-3;
H20, 6-8%). This compound (artifact), which was more
basic than the original amino acid (as indicated by its
ionic mobility), gave the same scarlet reaction with
Sakaguchi's reagent but a yellow and not a purple colour
with ninhydrin. When dissolved in 0- 1 N-NaOH the artifact
changed (within 24 hr. at room temperature) to a less basic
compound giving a purple reaction with ninhydrin and
showing Rp values in five solvent systems and ionic mobi-
lities at pH 1-9 and 3-6 identical with those both of the
unknown guanidino compound in the seed and authentic
y-hydroxyarginine (kindly supplied by Dr Y. Fujita) which
was used as a 'marker'. The amino acid itself behaved as a
mono-oc-amino carboxylic acid when treated successively
with cupric nitrate and ninhydrin (Larsen & Kjaer, 1960).
The infrared-absorption and nuclear-magnetic-resonance
spectra ofthe artifact (Hirst & Foster, 1964) were consistent
with this compound being the lactone of y-hydroxyarginine.
Alkaline hydrolysis of the lactone
The isolated hydrochloride (5 mg.) was refluxed with
0-1 N-NaOH (5 ml.) for 3 hr. The solution was evaporated to
dryness at room temperature under reduced pressure,
redissolved in 2 ml. of 10% (v/v) propan-2-ol and brought
to pH 7 with N-HCI. Spots (10 ,u.) of the solution were
chromatographed and subjected to ionophoresis on paper
in the solvent systems and the buffer solutions described
above. Each spot was run with a 'marker' of authentic
y-hydroxyornithine (supplied by Dr Y. Fujita) and the
papers were developed with ninhydrin and Ehrlich's
reagent.
The hydrolysate gave a strong ninhydrin-positive spot
that corresponded on all papers to y-hydroxyornithine and
a fainter spot that also gave a yellow colour with Ehrlich's
reagent.
Identification of y-hydroxyornithine on paper. When
developed successively with ninhydrin and Ehrlich's
reagent as in the multiple-dipping sequence of Jepson &
Smith (1953) the initial purple spots with ninhydrin given
on paper by y-hydroxyornithine and by the principal
product of alkaline hydrolysis of the isolated artifact
changed to stable brown-grey spots. Hydroxyproline
(Jepson & Smith, 1953), 4-methyleneproline (Gray &
Fowden, 1962) and homocitrulline (Bell, 1962) are reported
to show colour changes with these reagents but only
y-hydroxyornithine appears to give the brown-grey colour.
When dipped in the periodate-acetylacetone reagent
developed by Schwartz (1958) for the identification of
serine and 8-hydroxylysine, the product of alkaline hydro-
lysis and the authentic y-hydroxyornithine gave identical
yellow spots, indicating that periodate oxidation had
liberated formaldehyde and confirming the presence of
amino and hydroxyl groups on the ultimate and penulti-
mate carbon atoms of the chain respectively.
y-Hydroxyornithine in Vicia
Finely ground seed (200 mg.) from each of 64 species of
Vicia was stirred with ethanol (1 ml.) and 0- IN-hydro-
chloric acid (1 ml.). After 17 hr. at room temperature the
suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatants analysed
by paper chromatography and ionophoresis on Whatman
no. 1 paper in the solvent systems and buffer solutions
described above.
The extracts from the seeds of V. unijuga and V. ono-
brychoides contained high concentrations (about 1 %) of a
Vol. 91 357

ninhydrin-positive compound with RF values and ionic
mobilities corresponding to those of authentic y-hydroxy-
ornithine in the five solvent systems and three buffer
solutions used.
This compound gave the characteristic brown-grey
reaction of y-hydroxyornithine on paper when treated
successively with ninhydrin and Ehrlich's reagent and a
yellow colour with the periodate-acetylacetone reagent of
Schwartz.
DISCUSSION
The genus Lathyrus may be subdivided into
groups of species, each of which is characterized by
a common association of free amino acids or related
compounds that occur in concentrations of about
1% in the seeds of its constituent members (Bell,
1962). Among these compounds are ay-diamino-
butyric acid (Ressler, Redstone & Erenberg,
1961), homoarginine, lathyrine, y-hydroxyhomo-
arginine (Bell, 1963) and a compound tentatively
identified as f-oxalylaminoalanine (oc-amino-
f-oxamoylaminopropionic acid) (Adiga, Rao &
Sarma, 1963). A survey of the ninhydrin-
positive compounds present in the seeds of the
closely related genus Vicia (Bell & Tirimanna,
1963b) has revealed that this genus may also
be subdivided on the same basis. The com-
pounds present in high concentration in the seeds
of Vicia are not, however, the same as those in
Lathyru8, and include arginine, canavanine, -
cyanoalanine (Ressler, 1962) and y-hydroxy-
arginine, the isolation of which has been described
in the present paper. Therefore one genus (Vicia)
stores relatively high concentrations of canavanine
and the C6 guanidino amino acids arginine and
y-hydroxyarginine, whereas the other (Lathyrus)
stores predominently the C7 amino acids homoargin-
ine, y-hydroxyhomoarginine and the related
compound lathyrine.
SUMMARY
1. The occurrence of y-hydroxyarginine in
plants has been confirmed by the isolation of its
lactone from seeds of Vicia sativa.
2. A new natural amino acid, y-hydroxy-
ornithine, has been identified by chromatography
and ionophoresis in the seeds of Vicia onobrycho-
ide8 and V. unijuga.
3. The closely related genera, LathyruB and
Vicia, characteristically store different groups of
guanidino amino acids.
4. A colour reaction for the identification of
y-hydroxyornithine on paper is described.
We thank Professor H. Harris for his interest in this
work and Mr W. G. Mackenzie for help in obtaining seed.

The Isolation of y-Hydroxyhomoarginine, as its Lactone, from Seeds
of Lathyrus tingitanus, its Biosynthesis and Distribution
BY E. A. BELL
Department of Biochemistry, King's College, London, W.C. 2
(Received 26 September 1963)
A study of the free amino acids and related
compounds in the seeds of 49 species of Lathyru8
(Bell, 1962a) revealed.the presence in the seeds of
L. aphaca, L. cyan?s, L. 8phaericus and L. tingitanuw
of lathyrine (i.e. 2-aminopyrimidin-4-ylalanine;
Bell & Foster, 1962), homoarginine (Bell, 1962b)
and a third new amino acid designated B3, sub-
sequently reported to bo y-hydroxyhomoarginine
(i.e. o-amino-E-guanidino-y-hydroxyhexanoic acid;
Bell, 1963). The existence of the last-named amino
acid had been predicted by Rao, Ramachandran &
Adiga (1963), who visualized it as a likely inter-
