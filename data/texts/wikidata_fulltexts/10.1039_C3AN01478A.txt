Secondarymetabolites composition is key to the inﬂuence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of thisplant. In this work, the phytochemical proﬁle of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performanceliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identiﬁed the main secondary metabolites in Z.jujuba seeds, including ﬂavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leadingchemical identiﬁed by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from theGC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical proﬁles, but levels of the chemicalcompounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites thatcould deﬁne the diﬀerences in quality. It was conﬁrmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an eﬀective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds.1 IntroductionZiziphus is a genus which has approximately 40 species of theRhamnaceae family, and is distributed mainly in warm andsubtropical regions throughout the world. As an importanteconomic species of this genus, Zizyphus jujubaMill. var. spinosahas generated much commercial value due to its signicantpharmacological functions. Insomnia and anxiety are the mainpharmaceutical activities attributed to the species in the widerapplication of this medicinal species.1 In addition, it also hasgood bioactivities against weakness, hyperhidrosis, livercomplaints, urinary trouble, fever, hypertension and hyperlipid-emia.2,3 Compared to other hypotonic plants, such as kava,4Z. jujuba (seeds) has a slow onset of eﬀect, and has both a long-term eﬀect on sleep architecture and low toxicity. As thecommercial quality of the biological sources is readily aﬀected bya number of factors, like the growing environment, processingconditions and genetic background the pharmaceutical capabil-ities of Z. jujuba seeds from various commercial sources vary.ation and Sustainable Utilization, Southof Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China.e, Department of Chemistry, NationalSingaporetrition, Clemson University, Clemson, SC510665, ChinaChemistry 2013Therefore, the pharmaceutical quality needs to be determinedbefore use.Natural bioactive compounds, including phenolics andcarbohydrates, are responsible for the pharmaceutical activities ofthis medicinal herb.5,6 As an important ingredient of Chinesetraditional medicines, Z. jujuba seeds have abundant bioactivesecondary metabolites, including triterpene acids, unsaturatedfatty acids and avonoid C-glycosides,7–9 which are criticalchemicals involved both in disease treatment and health benets.Metabolomics is being increasingly utilized to gain insightinto the chemical composition of biological materials.10 Deter-mination of metabolomic proles by ultrahigh performanceliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) hasbeen recently adopted as an eﬀective technique to understandthe chemical nature of a medicinal plant. Though nuclearmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is also widely applied inmetabolomics, the MS-based technique shows better precisionand resolution than NMR. Therefore, in this work, the phyto-chemical prole of Z. jujuba seed was analysed by both UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS to judge the quality of commercial Z. jujuba seed.2 Materials and methods2.1 Plant materialSix Z. jujuba seeds were purchased from Neautus TraditionalChinese Medicine Co.

Ltd (Anguo, China), respectively. Seedsamples 2#, 4# and 6# were raw Z. jujuba seeds fromWenshang,Shandong province, Zhanhuang, Hebei province and Anguo,Hebei province, respectively. They were treated to obtainsamples 1#, 3# and 5# by the following procedures. One kilo-gram of raw Z. jujuba seeds was heated at 200 C with agitation.The seeds were toasted brown and when a pleasant aroma couldbe smelled, they were collected as the heat-treated sample.Each sample was pulverized into powder and sieved through60-mesh sieve.2.2 UPLC-MS/MS analysisTwo grams of Z. jujuba seed powder were extracted with 20 mlmethanol during the course of one week in the dark at roomtemperature. The extract was centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min.Each sample was extracted in triplicate. The supernatant wascollected and subjected to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. AcquityUPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an AcquityUPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 mm, 2.1  150 mm) was used forchemical isolation. A gradient elution programme was con-ducted as follows: 0–2 min, 5% solvent B; 2–17 min, from 5% to30% solvent B; 17–20 min, from 30% to 55% solvent B; 20–35min, from 55% to 100% solvent B; 35–37 min, from 100% to 5%solvent B; 37–39 min, 5% solvent B. Solvent A was 0.1% formicacid in water, and solvent B was acetonitrile. The ow rate was0.25 ml min1. The column temperature was kept at 35 C.Detection was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spec-trometer detector using an electrospray ionization (ESI) inter-face. Ionization of the analytes was achieved using ESI innegative mode. The interface conditions were as follows:capillary voltage, 1.0 kV; cone voltage, 10 eV; collision voltage,10 eV; source temperature, 150 C; desolvation temperature, 500C; cone gas, nitrogen at a ow rate of 50 l h1; desolvation gas,nitrogen at a ow rate of 800 l h1; collision gas, argon at a owrate of 0.2 ml min1. Mass scan was set in the range of m/z50–2000. The daughter ion mode was monitored at a collisionvoltage in the range of 10–40 eV.2.3 GC-MS analysisOne gram of Z. jujuba seed powder was extracted with 10 ml ofhexane–acetone (7 : 3, v/v) during the course of one week in thedark at room temperature. The extracts were centrifuged at8000g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and sub-jected to trimethylsilyl derivatization due to the occurrence oforganic acids. The trimethylsilyl derivatization was conductedby the samemethod as Yang et al.11 A gas chromatography-massspectrometer (GCMS-QP 2010, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) wasused to analyse the chemical composition. The derivatives wereloaded into a RTX-5 capillary column. The temperature programwas set as follows: the initial temperature of column was 50 C,holding for 1 min, increasing to 250 C at 3 C min1, holdingfor 17 min, increasing to 280 C at 10 C min1; injectiontemperature: 250 C. The ion source of the mass spectrometerwas set at 250 C. The scanning m/z range was 20–550 amu. 1 mlof sample was injected and the split ratio was 10 : 1. The carrier6882 | Analyst, 2013, 138, 6881–6888gas was helium with ow rate of 1.0 ml min1. The peaks wereidentied by NIST database and retention index.2.4 Data analysisFor each sample, the peak heights of chemicals in the massspectra were recorded and averaged over three replicates. Anunsupervised multivariate statistical method, principalcomponent analysis (PCA), was used on UV-scaling data. PCAwas performed to visualize the clustering of diﬀerent sampleswithout any knowledge of their group membership.3 Results3.1 The composition of semi-polar phytochemicalsdetermined by UPLC-MS/MSUPLC-MS/MS analyses were conducted on the methanolicextract of Z. jujuba seeds to identify semi-polar chemicals. Fig. 1shows the full scan ESI-MS spectra in negative mode, whichrecord the levels of secondary metabolites. Identied chemicalsare listed in Table 1. Those chemicals with relatively high peakare interpreted here.The leading peak was betulinic acid (retention time 30.55min, Fig. 2). The MS spectra had an [M  H] at m/z 455.0. Thefragment ions were interpreted as follows: m/z 437.0 (loss ofH2O), 410.9 (loss of carboxyl).12 A base peak at m/z 188.9 wascharacteristic of the fragmentation of triterpenoid moleculeswith a lupane skeleton bearing a hydroxy group in position 3. Ithad arisen from the fragmentation of the C ring by cleavage ofC9–C11 and C8–C14 bonds followed by the loss of H2O.13Moreover, two peaks at m/z 247.4 and 202.6 were observed,which indicated the formation of the [C16H24O2] fragment ionand further loss of carboxyl.14The peak at 29.79 min showed an [M  H] at m/z 454.9 andan [2M  H] at m/z 911.1, which indicated that the molecularweight (456) was equal to betulinic acid. The fragment ion atm/z411.4 was formed by the loss of the carboxyl moiety. m/z 436.5indicated the loss of H2O due to the elimination of the hydroxylgroup at position 3. Another two fragment ions atm/z 207.2 and189.1 were detected. This fraction was identied as zizy-phursolic acid based on above results and literature.15Linoleic acid (molecular weight 280) was detected from thefraction at 32.06 min, which had an [M  H] at m/z 278.9. Thefragment ion at m/z 260.6 was formed due to the loss of OH inthe carboxyl group. m/z 58.7 represented the occurrence ofacetic acid. A peak at m/z 70.6 was detected.Spinosin, a avonoid C-glycoside, is a characteristicallybioactive compound in Z. jujuba seeds, which was detected at11.78 min. The mass spectra showed an [M  H] at m/z 606.7and a [2M  H] at m/z 1214.9 for the precursor ion. The frag-ment ion at m/z 427.2 represented the loss of glucose and H2O.The diﬀerence (120) between m/z 606.7 and 486.8 was charac-teristic of the breakage of glucose at C1–O and C2–C3. Otherfragment ions were detected at m/z 366.9 and 118.8. They werecharacteristic of spinosin. This mass spectral information wasconrmed in the literature.16This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013Fig. 1 UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS proﬁles of Z. jujuba seeds.

They had the same distribution ofprecursor and fragment ions. An [M  H] at m/z 485.0 and a[2M  H] at m/z 971.2 were observed for the precursor ion. m/z471.4 was formed by the loss of methyl. Fragment ions at m/z441.0 was generated by the loss of one carboxyl moiety.m/z 423.4indicated the loss of carboxyl and H2O. In combination with theinformation in the literature,17 they were identied to be epi-ceanothic acid and ceanothic acid.A peak at 20.79 min was analysed. An [M  H] atm/z 1042.9was found to be the precursor ion, which was consistent withthe molecular weight of jujuboside B (1044). The fragment ionat m/z 910.9 indicated the loss of xylose, and m/z 310.6 repre-sented the occurrence of xylose-(1,2)-glucose. An [M  H] atm/z 1205.1 in the mass spectra at 20.28 min was consistent withthe molecular weight of jujuboside A (1206). m/z 1187.4 wasformed due to the loss of H2O. m/z 751.0 indicated the penta-saccharide fragment ion.3.2 Volatile chemicals composition determined by GC-MSThe volatile chemicals were extracted by hexane/acetone, tri-methylsilylated and determined by GC-MS, which gave 22volatile compounds (Table 2), including alcohols, carboxylicThis journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013acids, esters, and terpenoids. The leading volatile chemical wasoleic acid in the GC-MS prole (Fig. 1B). Linoleic acid andstearic acid were the next most prolic volatile chemical. Othervolatile compounds with percentage higher than 5% were pal-mitic acid and 2-monoeicosanoylglycerol, respectively.3.3 Principal component analysesPrincipal component analysis was conducted on the semi-polarphytochemicals of Z. jujuba seed samples. The rst two principalcomponents explained 59.2% of the total variance, in which therst principal component explained 33.6% and the secondexplained 25.6%.

At present,UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS are two eﬃcient and precise tech-niques to resolve the metabolomic prole of plant resources.18The former can identify semi-polar chemicals in a precise andtime-saving manner. It has been widely applied to characterizeplant secondary metabolites. GC-MS can reveal the chemicalnature of volatile chemicals, which dene the avor of a plant.19GC-MS also provides complementary data to UPLC-MS/MSanalysis to obtain a complete metabolomic prole. From thephytochemical prole obtained in this work, it could beconcluded that six Z. jujuba seeds had similar phytochemicalproles, but that the level of each peak varied.Through phytochemical prole investigation, approximately50 chemicals were identied from Z. jujuba seeds. As most ofchemicals are diﬃcult to obtain commercially, the structuresidentied in this paper identify the possible chemicals on thebasis of fragment ions and the literature.

Bothcontribute to the benecial hypnotic eﬀect of Z. jujuba seeds,and the mechanism of action for jujubosides is related to theserotonergic system.20 Spinosin is a characteristic avonoidC-glycoside, which occurred at a high levels in Z. jujuba seeds(Fig. 1). It is another important bioactive compound responsiblefor the hypnotic eﬀect of this plant. Similar to jujubosides,spinosin regulates the serotonergic system to inhibitinsomnia.21 Further evidence suggested that spinosin potenti-ates pentobarbital-induced sleep via the serotonin-IA(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-[HT.sub.1A]) receptor.22 Though cyclo-peptide alkaloids have been reported as another pharmacolog-ically active chemical to contribute to the hypnotic acitivity,23they were not detected from the UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MSproles in this work. P. tenuifolia root is another commonlyused ingredient in traditional medicine to treat insomnia.24 Theresponsible active chemicals are oligosaccharide esters andsaponins, which are diﬀerent to the chemicals in Z. jujubaseeds. Therefore, it is important to dene pharmacologicalquality by quantifying the levels of specic chemicals. UPLC-MS/MS is a good choice of method to carry out the analysis.This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013In the UPLC-MS/MS prole, betulinic acid and bizyphursolicacid were the leading chemicals in Z. jujuba seeds.14 Both sharesimilar structural characteristics as pentacyclic triterpene acid,which implies similar bioactivities. Comparing with zizy-phursolic acid, betulinic acid is more common in the plantkingdom and has been proven to display diverse biologicaleﬀects, including anticancer, antiinammatory and antiviralactivities.25 It is also a potential biological response modiercapable of strengthening the immune system of the host.26 Theoccurrence of these bioactive compounds in large amountsresults in the good pharmacological and health-benecialproperties of Z. jujuba seeds.GC-MS analysis showed that the major volatile compoundsin Z. jujuba seeds were fatty acids. Among these, oleic acid wasthe leading volatile chemical, which is consistent with thedeterminations of Zhao et al.27 It is also a pharmacologicallyactive chemical. The essential oil of Z. jujuba seeds has beenreported to have hair growth promoting activity,28 and antiin-ammatory activity.29Based on the level and importance for pharmacologicalfunction, spinosin, zizyphursolic acid, betulinic acid, ceanothicacid, epiceanothic acid and linoleic acid identied in the UPLC-MS/MS prole were selected to evaluate the quality of Z. jujubaAnalyst, 2013, 138, 6881–6888 | 6885Table 2 Volatile chemicals occurring in hexane–acetone extract of Z. jujuba seeddetermined by GC-MSNo.Retention time(min) ChemicalsMolecularweight1 10.87 Octyl 3-alcohol 1302 43.1 Tetradecanoic acid 2283 48.5 Palmitelaidic acid 2544 49.4 Palmitic acid 2565 50.8 Linoleic acid methyl ester 2946 50.9 Oleic acid methyl ester 2967 51.6 9-Octadecenoic acid 2828 52.3 Heptadecanoic acid 2709 52.7 Linoleic acid ethyl ester 30810 53 Ethyl oleate 31011 54.4 Linoleic acid 28012 54.6 Oleic acid 28213 55.1 Stearic acid 28414 59.7 11-Eicosenoic acid 31015 60.4 Eicosanoic acid 31216 61.2 2-(9,12-Octadecadienyloxy)-ethanol31017 64.4 1-Monopalmitoylglycerol 33018 65.3 Tetracosanoic acid 36819 66.7 Thymol-glucoside 31220 67.6 2-Monooctadecenoylglycerol 34221 68.5 2-Monoeicosanoylglycerol 38622 69.9 Squalene 410Analyst PaperOpen Access Article.

Z. jujuba seeds with relatively high levels of bioactivecompounds are considered good quality. Through ANOVAanalysis of representative chemicals levels (data not shown), theresults indicated that the six seed samples studied had nosignicant diﬀerence in the levels of zizyphursolic acid. Thelevels of betulinic acid (2# > 4# ¼ 6#), linoleic acid (1# > 6#),ceanothic acid (3# ¼ 5# > 6# > 2#), epiceanothic acid (5# > 3# >1#) were detected. It is not possible to dene the total quality ofZ. jujuba seeds through only the level of one bioactivecompound. Therefore, PCA should be conducted to diﬀeren-tiate the quality between the samples.Fig. 3 Plots of PCA on semi-polar and volatile chemicals of Z. jujuba seeds.Loading plot (A) and score plot (A) are the results of semi-polar chemicals; loadingplot (B) and score plot (B) are the results of volatile chemicals.4.2 PCA of Z. jujuba seeds phytochemicalsPCA is an unsupervised clustering technique for identifyingpatterns in data, expressing the data in such a way as to empha-size their similarities and diﬀerences. Through reducing thenumber of dimensions, it can dene a limited number of prin-cipal components which describe independent variation in theresults.10,30 In the present work, PCA was carried out on semi-polarand volatile chemicals of Z. jujuba seeds to nd the principalphytochemicals dening the pharmacological quality. Theloading plot displayed the inuence of individual spectral peaksin each principal component and described the diﬀerence of thesamples in the score plot.31 The points in the loading plot far fromthe zero point represented characteristic markers with the mostcondence for each group.

It was better to judge the quality on the basis of UPLC-MS/MS analyses, and the GC-MS results could also be used as asupplementary reference. Fig. 3A shows the characteristiccompounds in each sample. The rst two principal componentsexplained most of the total variance. It was surprising that betu-linic acid had the leading peak in the UPLC-MS/MS prole.However, it was not the representative chemical in the rst twoprincipal components due to the insignicant variance. Onlythose chemicals having signicant variance are recorded in thePCA model. The loading plot showed that ceanothic acid, 600-fer-uloylspinosin, jujuboside B (second quadrant), glycerol ester 1,linoleic acid derivative, pseudolaroside B (third quadrant),kaempferol 3-rutinoside, linoleic acid (fourth quadrant) are theprincipal components which dened the quality diﬀerencesbetween Z. jujuba seeds. The sample located in a quadrant of scoreplot is characterized by high amounts of bioactive compoundslocated in the same quadrant and low amounts of compounds inthe opposite quadrant of the loading plot. In this work, samples1#, 2# and 4# shared closely related similar qualities, which hadhigh amounts of linoleic acid and kaempferol 3-rutinoside, andlow amounts of ceanothic acid. However, samples 3#, 5# and 6#showed signicant diﬀerences between one another.5 Concluding remarksFrom the above results, it could be concluded that determinationof the phytochemical prole is an eﬃcient way to dene thepharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. By using analyses ofUPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS, the semi-polar and volatile chemicalswere identied and their levels were statistically compared.Betulinic acid was the leading semi-polar chemical in Z. jujubaseeds, and oleic acid was the leading volatile chemical. PCA coulddiﬀerentiate well between the quality of Z. jujuba seed samples.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for nancial support from the GuangdongNatural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar, theNational Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31071638),the Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy ofSciences (no.
