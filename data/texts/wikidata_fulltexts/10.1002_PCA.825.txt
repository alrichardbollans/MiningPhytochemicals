Recent publications have shown that theselaurels exhibit anti-thrombin activity (Medeiros et al.,2000). The hexane extract of the leaves contains twolactones, costunolide (1) and dehydrocostuslactone (2)(Tinoco, 2000) that are known to possess plant growthregulatory and cytotoxic properties (Sun et al., 2003).These sesquiterpene lactones, which are mainly found inthe Asteraceae but also occur infrequently in other fami-lies of higher and lower plants, have recently receivedrenewed attention since both 1 and 2, isolated from bayleaves (L. nobilis), were found to inhibit inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS; Matsuda et al., 2000) and, further-more, 1 was shown to have inhibitory effects on blood-ethanol elevation (Matsuda et al., 2002), to inhibit theRAS-farnesyl-protein-transferase (Park et al., 2001), toinduce differentiation in human leukaemia HL-60 cells(Choi et al., 2002a), and to trigger apoptosis in humanleukaemia U937 cells (Choi et al., 2002b).Until 2002, it was considered that the laurels endemicto the archipelagos of Madeira, Azores and Canariesconstituted a single species referred to as Laurus azorica(Seub.) Franco. Recently it was determined that therewere sufficient distinctions to consider the laurels fromMadeira and Canaries as a separated taxon, now class-ified as Laurus novocanariensis Rivas Mart., Lousã,Fern. Prieto, E. Días, J. C. Costa and C. Aguiar (Rivas-Martínez et al., 2002).On the island of Madeira, the fixed oil, traditionallyobtained by boiling and crushing the fruits (drupes) ofL. novocanariensis, is used in external application for itscicatrising and anti-rheumatic properties and it is takeninternally for the treatment of apoplexy (Rivera andObón, 1995). The main fatty acid chains present in theoil have been analysed by GC after trans-esterification,and were found to be oleic, palmitic, linoleic and lauricin descending order of abundance (P. Castilho, unpub-lished results). The oil also contains the sesquiterpenelactones costunolide (1) and dehydrocostuslactone (2)DETERMINATION OF COSTUNOLIDE AND DEHYDROCOSTUSLACTONE 105Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem. Anal. 16: 104–107 (2005)and these have been isolated by a combination of CC andTLC (see Experimental section).The aim of the present work was to establish a method,based on the analysis of the 13C-NMR spectrum, thatwould allow the direct identification and quantitativedetermination of the lactones 1 and 2 without previousseparation from the principal constituents (glycerides) ofthe fixed oil of L. novocanariensis.EXPERIMENTALFractionation of the oil and isolation of the lactones.Commercial samples of the fixed oil from L. novo-canariensis were prepared and supplied by local prod-ucers on the island of Madeira. A sample was submittedto column chromatography over silica gel (200–500 µm)eluted with pentane and increasing amounts of diethylether (100:0 to 0:100) to yield six fractions, F1–F6. Frac-tion F1, which eluted with pentane, contained terpenehydrocarbons; F2 and F3 were composed exclusivelyof triacylglycerides (TG); and fraction F4 contained,apart from some TG, mainly 1,2- and 1,3-diacylglycerides(DG). Although still containing some glycerides (TG,1,2- and 1,3-DG), the 13C-NMR spectrum of F5 exhib-ited the characteristic signals of costunolide (1) anddehydrocostuslactone (2) (Jacobsson et al., 1995; Yuuyaet al., 1999). Fraction F6 appeared to be a complex mix-ture of TGs and DGs, whilst monoacylglycerides (MGs)were detected in small amounts together with otherminor components. Further purification of F5 by pre-parative TLC yielded the isolated lactones 1 and 2in sufficient quantities to record 13C-NMR spectra.Identifications were established by comparison of thechemical shifts with those reported in the literature(Jacobsson et al., 1995; Yuuya et al., 1999).Liquid–liquid partition. A sample of the fixed oil(50.19 g) was stripped of its volatile components byhydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus to yield5.0 g of an odourless residue containing the lipids andother non-volatile compounds. The residue was dissolvedin n-hexane and filtered through activated charcoal toremove the chlorophylls. The filtrate was extracted withmethanol (4 × 20 mL). The portion that was insoluble inmethanol contained lipid components. The combinedmethanolic extracts were dried under vacuum at roomtemperature in a rotary evaporator, the residue taken upin 10 mL of acetonitrile and the solution washed withn-hexane (3 × 10 mL) to remove fats and waxes. Theacetonitrile solution was dried under vacuum at roomtemperature in a rotary evaporator and the residue(2.62 g; 5.2% w/w of the fixed oil) taken up in 1 mLmethanol and analysed by TLC. The methanolic fractioncontained mainly the lactones 1 and 2.13C-NMR analysis. All 13C-NMR spectra were recordedon a Bruker (Wissembourg, France) AC 200 Fouriertransform spectrometer, operating at 50.323 MHz for 13C,equipped with an Aspect 3000 computer and a 10 (or5) mm probe. The spectra were recorded in deutero-chloroform (CDCl3) and all shift values (δ) were referredto the internal standard (TMS). The spectra of the sixchromatographic fractions were recorded with the fol-lowing parameters: pulse width (PW), 5 (or 3) µs (flipangle 45°); acquisition time, 1.3 s; relaxation delay (D1),2 s (total recycling time 3.3 s) for 32 K data table with aspectral width (SW) of 12,500 Hz (250 ppm); compositephase decoupling (CPD) of the proton band; and digitalresolution, 0.763 Hz/pt. Exponential line broadeningmultiplication (LB = 1 Hz) of the free induction decay(FID) was applied before Fourier transform. Thenumber of accumulated acquisitions was 3000–5000depending on the quantity of product: 200 (or 70) mg ofthe mixture in 2 (or 0.5) mL CDCl3.The quantitative analysis of two samples of fixedoil of L. novocanariensis (188–296 mg of oil; 2 mLCDCl3; 10 mm probe) was carried out using the Brukermicro-program (signal acquisition with inverse gateddecoupling of protons, pulse width = 90°; pulse delay 5 ×T1 = 25 s).T1 measurements. The longitudinal relaxation delays ofthe 13C nuclei (T1 values) of 1 were determined by theinversion-recovery method using the standard sequence:180°–τ–90°–D1, with a relaxation delay D1 of 20 s.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of sesquiterpene lactones in the fixed oilfrom drupes of L. novocanariensisThe most important signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum ofa sample of fixed oil of L. novocanariensis (Fig. 1) corre-sponded to fatty acid chains. A comparison of the signalintensities of the olefinic carbons of the unsaturatedfatty acids confirmed that the oleic chain (C18:1 ∆9Z)was predominant over the linoleic (C18:2 ∆9,12 ZZ)chain, and that the linolenic chain (C18:3 ∆9,12,15 ZZZ)was present in only very small amounts. These results arein good agreement with those obtained by GC analysisof the trans-esterified oil (P. Castilho, unpublishedresults). Characteristic signals of TGs and 1,3-DGs (in aratio of approximately 96:4) were observed together withsignals associated with trace amounts of 1,2-DG. Signalscorresponding to minor components, assignable to thelactones costunolide (1) and dehydrocostuslactone (2)were also detected (Fig. 1). Using the chemical shiftvalues determined from the analysis of the purifiedsesquiterpene lactones (see the Experimental section), itwas possible to detect all of the carbon signals associatedwith the two lactones in the 13C-NMR spectrum ofthe total fixed oil, thus permitting their identificationwithout the need for purification.Quantitative analysis of 1 and 2A further aim of the study was to develop a method forthe quantification of the lactones 1 and 2 by direct 13C-NMR analysis of the vegetable oil without performing aprevious separation. Although several techniques can beemployed for the 13C-NMR quantification of mixed com-ponents, the most common pulse sequence was chosenfor the quantitative determination. This consists of a 90°pulse angle, and a delay between pulses that was fivetimes longer than the largest longitudinal relaxation time(T1) associated with the inverse gated decoupling of theprotons (Mooney, 1989). This method allows the total106 B. FERRARI ET AL.Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem. Anal. 16: 104–107 (2005)Figure 1.

Peaks labelled ‘Cos’ are associated with costunolide (1), thoselabelled ‘Dcl’ with dehydrocostuslactone (2), and those labelled ‘Fc’ with fattyacid chains.relaxation of all of the carbon atoms as well as the sup-pression of the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE effect).Only the signals of the protonated carbons were takeninto account. Diglyme was used as internal standardsince (i) the NMR signals of this molecule did not over-lap with those of the lactones to be quantified, and(ii) the relaxation times of the protonated carbons in 1,chosen as a model, were between 1.2 and 5.0 s (Table 1)and compatible with those of diglyme (the methylenecarbons exhibit T1 = 3.8 s).The determination of the mass of each lactone (mL) inthe sample was calculated from equation (1):  mI M mI MLL L        =× ××2 DD D(1)where IL is the mean value of the intensities of thesignals belonging to the protonated carbons C1–C3, C5–C9 and C13–C15 of the considered lactone, MLis themolar mass of the considered lactone (232 g/mol for 1and 230 g/mol for 2), mDis the mass (mg) of diglyme, IDis the mean value of the intensities of the signals of thetwo methylene carbons of diglyme, and MDis the molarmass of diglyme (134 g/mol). The factor 2 has to beintroduced because of the symmetry of the molecule ofdiglyme.Two samples of the fixed oil of L. novocanariensisobtained from different local producers, were submittedto NMR analysis. The masses of costunolide (1) mCOS anddehydrocostulactone (2) mDCL were determined for thefirst oil sample using data obtained from three independ-ent 13C-NMR experiments in order to ensure the preci-sion of the analysis. The mean values (n = 3) for thecontents of the lactones in the oil (expressed as percent-ages) were 3.8% for 1 (standard deviation 0.1) and 1.5%for 2 (standard deviation = 0.2). As expected, the preci-sion of the measurement was better for 1, the more abun-dant lactone, than for 2 (Table 2). The contents of thetwo lactones were slightly different for the secondsample of oil, being 3.4 and 1.4%, respectively.These findings are in very good agreement withresults derived from the much less accurate methodfor determining total sesquiterpene lactones involvingliquid–liquid partition of the oil between n-hexane andmethanol. This partition gave 5 ± 0.5% of a methanolicextract that consisted mainly of lactones (see Experi-mental section): the 13C-NMR signals of the lactoneswere totally absent from the spectrum of the n-hexanefraction.The contents of 1 and 2 in the fixed oil of L.novocanariensis are quite significant compared with theamounts present in the methanolic extract from bayleaves (L. nobilis) that are, respectively, 0.9 and 0.04%(Matsuda et al., 2000). However, the levels of 1 and 2determined in L. novocanariensis are considerably lowerthan those in Costus resinoid, the commercially availableextract from Costus roots (Saussurea lappa), which is theusual source of these lactones, 9 and 18.4%, respectively(Kobayashi et al., 2001).Table 1. 13C-NMR chemical shifts (δ, ppm) of costunolide (1)and dehydrocostuslactone (2) and relaxation times(T1) of the protonated carbons of 11 2Carbon (δ, ppm) T1(s) (δ, ppm)1 127.26 2.2 47.612 26.20 1.2 30.313 39.46 2.2 32.614 141.51 — 151.245 127.05 2.2 52.026 81.95 3.5 85.297 50.41 4.0 45.128 28.05 2.2 30.949 40.99 1.4 36.2810 136.96 — 149.2311 140.07 — 139.7412 170.55 — 170.3313 119.71 1.2 120.2314 16.12 4.5 109.6115 17.36 5.0 112.62DETERMINATION OF COSTUNOLIDE AND DEHYDROCOSTUSLACTONE 107Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
