Their structures were identified usingspectroscopic methods. Among these compounds, 1 and 2 are new and 3–15 wereisolated from this plant for the first time. Antioxidant activities of compounds 2–15against H2O2-induced injury in SY5Y cells and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicalscavenging activities were evaluated.Keywords: Broussonetia papyrifera; phenolics; antioxidation1. IntroductionThe fruits of Broussonetia papyrifera(Moraceae), known as ‘Chu-Shi-Zi’, havebeen used as an important tonic for thetreatment of impotency in China [1]. Theroots, barks, and leaves of B. papyrifera areused in medical applications in traditionalChinese medicine [1], and their chemicalconstituents and various biological activitieshave already been extensively studied [2].Previous reports indicated that the fruitextract possesses potent antioxidant effectsrelated to anti-aging [3], and could enhancelearning and memory ability for Alzheimer’sdisease [4]. Our bioassay revealed that theEtOH extract of the fruits could protectneuronal cells from H2O2-induced injury.However, only the nutritional composition inthe fruit was analyzed [5]. So far, only alimited number of substances have beenisolated [6], and the specific phytochemicalsresponsible for its antioxidant activity havenot been thoroughly identified. It is thereforeimperative to investigate the antioxidantcompounds which could be used for thetreatment of certain diseases mediated byreactive oxygen species (ROS). Our chemi-cal work led to the isolation of 15 phenoliccompounds (Figure 1), in which 1 and 2are new and others were isolated fromthis plant for the first time. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengingactivity (RSA) and neuroprotective effectsagainst H2O2-induced SY5Y cell injury wereevaluated. In this paper, we describethe isolation, structural elucidation, andantioxidant activities of these isolates.2.

The1H NMRspectrum of 1 exhibited two typicalAA0BB0 systems and an ABX system inthe olefinic region (Table 1). The 13CNMR spectrum of 1 showed a total of 28carbon signals corresponding to threebenzene rings, three oxymethylenes,three oxymethines, two upfield methines,a carbonyl, and a methoxy group. Thisevidence suggested 1 to be a sesquilignan[7], which was further confirmed by closeinterpretation of 2D NMR data. The1H–1H COSY spectrum gave the spinsystems of H-7 (d 4.62)/H-8 (d 2.67)/H-9(d 3.62, 3.54), H-8/H-80 (d 4.24)/H-90(d 4.15), H-700 (d 4.81)/H-800 (d 4.57)/H-900(d 3.75, 3.52). The HMBC correla-tions (Figure 2) of H-7/C-2, H-60, H-90,H-8/C-70, and H-800/C-100, in combinationof 1H–1H COSY and 1H NMR spectralbehaviors, revealed the presence of threephenylpropanoid units in the molecule.Additional HMBC interactions of H-7/C-90, H-8/C-70, H-80/C-9, and H-800/C-40allowed the linkage of the three phenyl-propanoids via C-8ZC-80 and C-40ZOZC-800. The OMe group was positioned at C-30by the aid of O-methyl response to C-30 inthe HMBC spectrum. The stereochemistryof 1 was achieved by NOESY correlationas well as coupling constant of vicinalprotons. In the NOESY spectrum, H-7correlating with H-80 indicated that theyare cofacial. The JH-7,H-8 value of 8.8 Hzsuggested a trans relationship of H-7 andH-8. The JH-700,H-800 value was 6.1 Hz,indicating an erythro-configuration [8].As a result, the structure of 1 was assignedCHOHO3COOHHO HOOCH38CHO9OHHOOHOHOHHOOHOH12 13HO6OCH3OHHOOCH37COOHHOOH4OCH310H3COGlcOOCH311OHGlcOGlcO5CH2OHCH2OH CH2OHOHOOGlcOCH3H3COOR14 R = H15 R = OHOGlcHOOHOCH3OHOHOOOHOHOOH12147 8 91'3' 4'7'8'9'1''4''7''8''9''14789Figure 1.

The1H NMR spectrum of 2 exhibited a typicalAA0BB0 system in the aromatic region. The13C NMR and DEPT spectra showedsignals for an aromatic ring, a sugar moietycorresponding to a glucopyranose, twooxymethylenes (dC 72.5, 64.9), and onemethine (dC 49.0). The multiplicities of H-7, H-8, and H-9 indicated the presence of a7-deoxyglycerol residue, which connectedto the benzene ring via C-1ZC-7 by theobserved HMBC connectivity of H-2/C-7.Acid hydrolysis of 2 yielded D-glucosedetermined by comparison with an auth-entic sample and its positive optical sign inwater. Furthermore, the HMBC correlationof H-10/C-8 assigned the position of theglucosyl moiety at C-8 (Figure 2). Theconfiguration of C-10 was determined to beb by a JH-10,H-20 value of 7.9 Hz. Conse-quently, the structure of 2 was elucidated as2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane-1,3-diol-1-O-b-D-glucopyranoside.The known compounds were identifiedas 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3), 3,4-dihy-droxybenzoic acid (4), arbutine (5)[9], dihydroconiferyl alcohol (6) [10],coniferyl alcohol (7) [11], ferulic acid (8)[12], p-coumaraldehyde (9), cis-syringin(10) [13], cis-coniferin (11) [14], erythro-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycerol (12) [15],OMeOHOHOOOHOHOOH1HOOHOOHOHOHOHO2Figure 2.

After cooling, the reactionmixture was neutralized and extractedwith CHCl3. TLC comparison (silicagel, CHCl3–MeOH 6:4) with authenticsamples revealed the presence of glucosein the water layer. The D-form of glucosewas determined by its positive opticalrotation in water.3.5 DPPH radical scavenging assayThe DPPH assay was carried out accordingto a previously described method [19].Briefly, 10ml of different concentrationsof the tested compounds (final concen-trations ranging from 0.16 to 100mM) wasadded to 190ml of DPPH solution (0.1 mMin EtOH), followed by 30 min of reactionat room temperature. The absorbance ofthe solution was read at 517 nm with aspectrophotometer (M5; Molecular DeviceCorporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Thepercentage of RSA (RSA%) was calcu-lated as follows: RSA% ¼ [(Ac 2 At)/Ac] £ 100%, where Ac is the averageabsorbance of the control and At is theabsorbance of the tested compounds orpositive drug. In this assay, vitamin C wasused as a positive control; the tests wereperformed in triplicate.3.6 Antioxidant assay against H2O2-induced injury in SY5Y cellsSH-SY5Y cells were grown in RPMI-1640supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum,10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin,100mg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mML-glutamine. SY5Y cell suspensions,which were adjusted to 1 £ 106/ml, wereseeded into a 96-well culture plate at100ml/well and incubated at 378C, 5%CO2 for 24 h, followed by incubation withH2O2 (final concentration of 250mM) anddifferent concentrations of compounds(final concentrations of 0.16–100mM)for another 24 h. After the treatment, cellviability was measured by the MTTmethod [20]. In brief, cells in the 96-wellplate were rinsed with serum-free RPMI-1640.

Afterthe medium with MTT was removed,200ml of DMSO was added to each well.Optical density was measured at 570 nmon a microplate reader (Molecular DevicesCorporation).Antioxidant activities of compounds2–15 were examined using DPPH radicalscavenging assay and H2O2-induced injuryin SY5Y cell assay. As shown in Table 2,several isolates showed radical scavengingcapacity against DPPH. Among theseisolates, the IC50 values of compounds 4,6, 8, and 15 were 39.5, 58.9, 65.3, and65.6mM, respectively, and they werecomparable to that of vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. As indicated by theIC50 values, the DPPH radical scavengingabilities of compounds 4, 6–8, and 15 withtwo vicinal oxygen-bearing groups at thebenzene ring are much stronger than thoseof 2, 3, 5, 9, 12–14 lacking this structuremotif in the molecules. The presence ofOH or OMe at C-3 may activate the site ofthe OZH bond at the C-4 position, whichled to an increase in H-donation. In theneuroprotective assay (Table 3), the resultsshowed that compounds 2–4, 7, 9, 13–15could salvage SY5Y cell death induced byH2O2, a typical ROS. Particularly, com-pounds 4 and 15 displayed better neuro-protective effects at a concentration of20mM.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the‘Xi-Bu-Zhi-Guang’ Project from the ChineseAcademy of Sciences and ‘Talent Scholarshipof Yunnan Youth (2007PY01-48)’ from Yun-nan Province, China.Note1.
