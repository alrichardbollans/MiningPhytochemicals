The structures and relative configurations of these compounds were elucidated byspectroscopic analyses, including 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and by thecomparison of their NMR data with those of related compounds.Introduction. –Gymnema sylvestre is a bushy climber of the Asclepiadaceae familythat is found mainly in the Central and Tropical Indian Peninsula, Sri Lanka, andAfrica. It is considered a medicinal plant and is used in folk medicine, ayurveda, andhomeopathy for treatment of asthma, eye disorders, inflammation, and snake bites, as atonic and refrigerant, diuretic, laxative, sedative for coughs, and especially as anantidote for diabetes [1]. Recent studies, based on the historical evidence of the manyuses in the medicinal field, have indicated that the leaves and roots of the plant are theparts that contain the biologically active ingredients [2]. The active compounds of G.sylvestre are called gymnemic acids [3]. Their use in the past to counteract the effects ofexcess glucose in diabetes mellitus explains the Hindi name of the plant, Gur-mawhich means destroyer of sugar. The plant extracts have been reported to exert anantimicrobial and hepatoprotective activity, and to lower the levels of triglycerides andLDL cholesterol, and raise the HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) [4] [5]. They alsoact as a deterrent against Prodenia eridania, prevent dental caries caused byStreptococcus mutans, and are used in skin cosmetics [6 – 8].In an investigation of G. sylvestre, we have isolated five known oleanane-typetriterpenes, 1 – 4 and 6, six new analogs, 5 and 7 – 11, and two lupane-type triterpenes, 12and 13, the former of which was new.Results and Discussion. – The CH2Cl2 extract of the aerial parts of G. sylvestre wasseparated into acidic and neutral fractions with 2n NaOH. The neutral fraction, washedwith H2O and concentrated under reduced pressure, was filtered through SiO2 withpetroleum ether, CH2Cl2, AcOEt, Me2CO, MeOH, and H2O, as eluents of increasingpolarity. Column chromatography of the fraction eluted with CH2Cl2 yieldedHelvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013)1036 2013 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zrichcompounds 1 – 13. The known triterpenes 1 – 4, 6, and 13 were identified as 3b,16b,28-trihydroxyolean-12-ene (1) [9], 3b,16b,21b,28-tetrahydroxyolean-12-ene (2) [10],3b,16b,22a,28-tetrahydroxyolean-12-ene (3) [11], 3b,23,28-trihydroxyolean-12-ene(4) [12], 3b,16b,21b,23,28-pentahydroxyolean-12-ene (6) [13], and 3b,16b,29-trihy-droxylup-20(30)-ene (13) [14].The new compounds were characterized by various spectroscopic methods. TheESI-MS of compound 5 showed a quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 475.2 ([MþH]þ),suggesting the molecular formula C30H50O4 and six degrees of unsaturation. Fragmentions atm/z 457.5 ([MH2OþH]þ), 439.3 ([M 2 H2OþH]þ), and retro-DielsAlderfragmentation ion, characteristic of an oleanane skeleton, at m/z 250.4 (50%)evidenced an olean-12-ene derivative. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of 5 confirmedthis assumption. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals of five H-atoms geminal to anO-bearing function as three double doublets at d(H) 4.10, 3.61, 3.52, a doublet at 3.53,and a signal at d(H) 3.31, partly obscured by solvent. The 13C-NMR spectrum (Table)exhibited signals of three O-bearing CH groups at d(C) 74.5, 74.3, 67.8 and of a O-bearing CH2 group at d(C) 67.8. In the upfield region of 1H-NMR, seven Me singletswere detected at d(H) 1.23, 1.02, 1.01, 0.95, 0.87, 0.81, and 0.71. The analysis of COSY,NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra allowed us to determine the structure of3b,16b,21b,23-tetrahydroxyolean-12-ene for this compound. The 1H,1H-COSY experi-ment showed correlations between HC(16) (d(H) 4.10) and CH2(15) (d(H) 1.67 and1.25); HC(21) (d(H) 3.52) and CH2(22) (d(H) 1.68 and 1.60); and HC(3) (d(H)Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013) 10373.61) and CH2(2) (d(H) 1.96 and 1.93). The latter correlated with the CH2(1) (d(H)1.65, 1.16). Finally, the signal of the olefinic H-atom HC(12) at d(H) 5.28 correlatedwith HC(11) (d(H) 1.96 and 1.93). The correlations in the HMBC experimentbetween the H-atom signal at d(H) 4.10 and that of the H-atoms of Me(28) at d(H)0.81 with the CH signal at d(C) 50.5, assigned to C(18) and bonded to H-atom with thesignal at d(H) 2.20, and between the signal of HC(18) with that of the O-bearingHC(16) at d(C) 67.8, indicated an OH group at C(16). The correlations between thesignals of HC(23) at d(H) 3.53 and 3.31 with that of the CH at d(C) 48.5, assigned toC(5) and bonded to the H-atom with the signal at d(H) 1.62, and between this signaland that of the O-bearing CH2 at d(H) 67.8 localized another OH group at C(23).Finally, the correlations of the signals of two geminal Me groups, i.e., Me(29) at d(H)0.95 and Me(30) at d(H) 0.87, with the C-atom signal at d(C) 74.5 defined a furtherhydroxylation site at C(21). These data, compared with those of the other isolatedtriterpenes, were in accordance with a 3,16,21,23-tetrahydroxyoleanane skeleton.

TheHC(21) showed NOE effects with the H-atoms of Me(29), HC(19), and HC(16)indicating also a b-orientation for the OH group at C(21).The ESI-MS of compound 7 showed a quasi-molecular-ion peak atm/z 491.4 ([MþH]þ), suggesting the molecular formula C30H50O5 and six degrees of unsaturation.Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 473.4 ([MH2OþH]þ), 455.3 ([M 2 H2OþH]þ), andretro-DielsAlder fragmentation-ion peak, characteristic of an oleanane skeleton, atm/z 267.5 (30%) evidenced an olean-12-ene derivative. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data weresimilar to those of triterpene 6, whose structure had been previously reported in [13]. Aconcise analysis of its spectroscopic data allowed us to determine the structure of 7 asthe C(21)-epimer of the reference compound 6. The 1H,1H-COSY experiment showedcorrelations between: the double doublet HC(16) at d(H) 4.57 and the CH2(15) atd(H) 1.80 and 1.30, the broad triplet HC(21) at d(H) 3.52 and the CH2(22) at d(H)2.14 and 1.77, abd the double doublet HC(3) at d(H) 3.62 and the CH2(2) at d(H)1.71. The correlations in the HMBC experiment between the two geminal Me(29)and Me(30) at d(H) 0.92 and 0.95, respectively, with C-atom at d(C) 76.2 indicateda hydroxylation site at C(21). The configuration at this C-atom has been definedby a NOE experiment where HC(21) showed NOE effects with both Me(29) andMe(30), indicating an a-orientation of the OH group. This assumption was supportedby the multiplicity of HC(21) signal, which appeared as a broad triplet at 3.52 (J¼3.0).The ESI-MS of compound 8 displayed a quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 475.5([MþH]þ), indicating the molecular formula C30H50O4 with six degrees of unsatura-tion. Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 457.3 ([MH2OþH]þ), 439.2 ([M 2 H2OþH]þ)were also detected. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals of six geminal H-atomsbound to an oxygenated function (two as double doublets at d(H) 3.72 and 3.62, andthree as doublets at d(H) 3.82, 3.76, and 3.54, and one at d(H) 3.30, obscured by thesolvent). In the upfield region, six Me singlets were evident at d(H) 1.26, 0.96, 2 0.92,0.76, and 0.68. The 13C-NMR (Table) showed two O-bearing CH signals at d(C) 78.2and 74.4, and those of two O-bearing CH2 groups at d(C) 67.9 and 64.5. The presence oftwo sp2 quaternary C-atoms (d(C) 139.9 and 129.8) indicated a C(13)¼C(18) bond.Analysis of COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra allowed us to determine thestructure of 3b,16b,23,28-tetrahydroxyolean-13,18-ene for this compound. This pro-posal was confirmed by the HMBC of Me(27) with the downfield olefinic C(13) andcorrelations of HC(16) and CH2(28) with the upfield olefinic C(18). The 1H,1H-Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013) 1039Figure. Key NOE correlations for compound 5COSY experiment showed correlations between HC(16) (d(H) 3.72) and CH2(15)(d(H) 1.98 and 1.35); and HC(3) (d(H) 3.62) and CH2(2) (d(H) 1.63). The lattercorrelated with CH2(1) (d(H) 1.71 and 1.05). Finally, H-atoms CH2(12) (d(H) 2.72 and1.89) correlated with CH2(11) (d(H) 1.27) that correlated with HC(9) (d(H) 1.59).The correlations in the HMBC experiment between CH2(23) (d(H) 3.54 and 3.30) withthe C-atom with a signal at d(C) 49.0, assigned to C(5) and bonded to H-atom with thesignal at d(H) 1.18, and between this H-atom with the C-atom with the signal at d(C)74.4 evidenced a OH group at the C(23) position. In the NOESY experiment, theHC(16) showed NOE effects with Me(27) and H-atomHaC(22), strongly suggestinga b-orientation for the OH group; moreover, one of the H-atoms Me(28) (d(H) 3.82)showed a NOE with Me(26) (d(H) 0.92), HC(12) (d(H) 2.72) showed a NOE effectwith CH2(19) (d(H) 2.35), and this latter gave NOEs with Me(29) and Me(30) (d(H)0.96 and 0.76, resp.). The structure of this triterpene was reported some time ago byShibata et al. [15] as a hydrogenation product of saikogenin A.The ESI-MS of compound 9 showed a quasi-molecular-ion peak atm/z 473.2 ([MþH]þ), suggesting the molecular formula C30H48O4 and seven degrees of unsaturation.Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 455.2 ([MH2OþH]þ), as well as an absorption band at3376 cm1 in the IR spectrum indicated the presence of OH groups. The retro-DielsAlder fragmentation-ion peak, characteristic of the oleane skeleton, in particularthe positively charged D/E ring-fragment peak at m/z 249.1 (42%) and the lessabundant, positively charged A/B ring-fragment peak at m/z 225.4 (6%) evidenced anolean-12-ene derivative. The IR spectrum also showed absorption bands at 1118, 1090,and 1045 cm1, consistent with the presence of HOC groups, and a band at 1722 cm1for the presence of a CO group. The 13C-NMR (Table) spectrum showed 30 signals,which with the DEPT experiment, revealed the presence of six Me groups (d(C) 31.8,27.9, 24.8, 18.5, 17.8, and 16.4), an olefinic C-atom (d(C) 124.4), an O-bearing CH group(d(C) 68.3), and two O-bearing CH2 groups (d(C) 69.5 and 68.5). The 1H-NMRspectrum indicated six tertiary Me groups (d(H) 1.28, 1.11, 1.07, 0.98, and 2 0.93), anO-bearing CH group as double doublet (d(H) 4.28), two O-bearing CH2 groups (twodoublets at d(H) 3.87 and 3.63), and it exhibited two signals (d(H) 3.29 and 3.38),obscured by the solvent, and a trisubstituted olefinic H-atom signal at d(H) 5.29attributed to HC(12). Analysis of COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectraallowed us to deduce the structure of 16b,23,28-trihydroxyolean-12-en-3-one for thiscompound. The 1H,1H-COSY experiment showed correlations between: HC(16)(d(H) 4.28) and CH2(15) (d(H) 1.88 and 1.43); CH2(2) (d(H) 2.48 and 2.40) and theCH2(1) (d(H) 1.88 and 1.50); and the olefinic H-atom HC(12) and CH2(11) (d(H)1.98). The correlations, in the HMBC experiment, between the H-atoms with thesignals at d(H) 3.63 and 3.38 with the CH group at d(C) 48.7, assigned to C(5) andbonded to H-atom with a signal at d(H) 1.99, and between this latter H-atom with theO-bearing CH (d(C) 68.5) localized an OH group at C(23). Additionally, the HMBCsbetween the H-atoms resonating at d(H) 3.63 and 3.38; and Me(26) (d(H) 0.93) withthe CO (d(C) 219.2); evidencing the C(3)¼O group and identifying the Me(23)group; and those between the H-atom with a signal at d(H) 2.22, bonded to CH,resonating at d(C) 45.6 and assigned to C(18), with the O-bearing CH with a signal atd(C) 68.3 indicated an OH group at C(28). The configuration of the OH group at C(16)was delineated by a NOESY experiment, showing NOEs between HC(16) (d(H)Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013)10404.28) and Me(27) (d(H) 1.28) and HC(19), indicating a b-orientation for the OHgroup.The ESI-MS of compound 10 showed a quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 489.2([MþH]þ), suggesting the molecular formula C30H48O5 and seven degrees ofunsaturation. Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 471.3 ([MH2OþH]þ), 453.1 ([M2 H2OþH]þ), and a retro-DielsAlder fragmentation-ion peak at m/z 267.2 (20%)were characteristic for an olean-12-ene derivative. The IR spectrum showed absorptionbands at 3350, 1118, 1090, and 1045 cm1, consistent with the presence of a OH andCOC groups, and a band of a CO group at 1724 cm1. The 13C-NMR spectrum(Table) displayed 30 signals, which, with the DEPTexperiment, revealed the presenceof six Me groups (d(C) 30.1, 27.7, 18.3, 18.0, 17.7, and 16.3), an olefinic C-atom (d(C)124.8), two O-bearing CH groups (d(C) 74.4 and 68.9), and two O-bearing CH2 groups(d(C) 68.4 and 68.3). The 1H-NMR spectrum revealed the presence of six tertiary Me(d(H) 0.89, 0.93, 0.96, 1.07, 1.10, and 1.28), two O-bearing CH groups (double doubletsat d(H) 4.20 and 3.55), two O-bearing CH2 groups (doublets at d(H) 3.60 and 3.78),and it exhibited two signals obscured by the solvent (d(H) 3.30 and 3.32), and onetrisubstituted olefinic H-atom signal at d(H) 5.31 attributed to HC(12). Analysis ofCOSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra allowed us to elucidate the structure of16b,21b,23,28-tetrahydroxyolean-12-en-3-one for this compound. Many of the corre-lations observed were similar to those of compound 9, indicating the same substitutionpattern in ringsA,B,C, andD. Another OH group was assigned to C(21) on the basis ofthe HMBCs between Me(29) and Me(30) (d(H) 0.96 and 0.89, resp.) with the O-bearing CH group resonating at d(C) 74.4, and between HC(21) (d(H) 3.55) and theC-atoms resonating at d(C) 48.6 (C(19)), 45.2 (C(17)), 37.7 (C(20)), 30.1 (C(29)), and18.0 (C(30)). The configuration of the OH group at C(21) has been determined by aNOESY experiment, where the H-atom with a signal at d(H) 3.55 showed NOE withMe(29) and HC(16) revealing a b-orientation for the OH group.The ESI-MS of compound 11 exhibited a quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 505.3([MþH]þ), suggesting the molecular formula C30H48O6 and seven degrees ofunsaturation. Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 487.2 ([MH2OþH]þ), 469.4 ([M2 H2OþH]þ), and retro-DielsAlder fragmentation-ion peak at m/z 283.1 (20%)evidenced an olean-12-ene derivative. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at3330, 1128, 1080, and 1050 cm1, consistent with the presence of OH and HOC groups,and a band of a CO group at 1723 cm1. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were consistentwith an olean-12-ene skeleton. The 13C-NMR spectrum (Table) displayed 30 signals,which, with the DEPTexperiment, revealed the presence of six Me groups (d(C) 30.6,28.1, 19.2, 18.5, 17.8, and 16.3), an olefinic C-atom (d(C) 125.6), three O-bearing CHgroups (d(C) 78.7, 74.4, and 69.8), and two O-bearing CH2 groups (d(C) 69.4 and 59.6).The 1H-NMR spectrum revealed the presence of six tertiary Me (d(H) 1.30, 1.10, 1.08,1.00, 0.93, and 0.92), three O-bearing CH groups (one as double doublet at d(H) 4.63)and two as doublets at d(H) 3.98 and 3.52), two O-bearing CH2 groups (four doublets atd(H) 3.92, 3.56 and 3.62, 3.36), and one trisubstituted olefinic H-atom (d(H) 5.40)assigned as HC(12). Analysis of COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra allowedus to determine the structure of 16b,21b,22a,23,28-pentahydroxyolean-12-en-3-one forthis compound. Many of the correlations observed were similar to those of compound10. The other OH group was assigned to C(22) on the basis of COSY that showedHelvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013) 1041correlation between HC(21) and HC(22) (d(H) 3.52 and 3.98, resp.), and the largecoupling constant of 11.0 Hz indicated their 1,2-trans relation. In the HMBC spectrum,correlations between Me(30) (d(H) 0.92) and Me(29) (d(H) 1.00) with the O-bearingHC(21) (d(C) 78.7); and between HC(21) and the C-atoms resonating at d(C) 74.4(C(22)), 47.5 (C(17)), 30.6 (C(29)), and 19.2 (C(30)) were observed. Furthermore, theO-bearing HC(22) correlated with C-atoms, resonating at d(C) 69.8, 59.6, and 43.3,that were assigned to the C(16), C(28), and C(18), respectively. The configuration ofthe OH groups was determined by a NOESY experiment, where the HC(21) showedNOE with Me(29) and HC(16), indicating a b-orientation for the OH group, andHC(22) showed NOE effects with the Me(30) and HC(18), revealing an a-orientation for the OH group.The ESI-MS of compound 12 showed a quasi-molecular-ion peak at m/z 475.1([MþH]þ), suggesting the molecular formula C30H50O4 and six degrees of unsatura-tion. Fragment-ion peaks at m/z 457.3 ([MH2OþH]þ) and 439.1 ([M 2 H2OþH]þ) were also observed. The 13C-NMR spectrum (Table) showed 30 C-atom signals,identified on the basis of a DEPT experiment as those for five Me, twelve CH2, sevenCH groups, and six quaternary C-atoms. The 1H-NMR data, together with thosederived from an HSQC experiment, evidenced the presence of two olefinic H-atoms(d(H) 4.72 and 4.60), bonded to the C-atom resonating at d(C) 111.1, four H-atoms(two doublets at d(H) 4.10 and 3.44, correlated to the C-atom resonating at d(C) 62.4,and one as doublet at d(H) 3.52, and one at d(H) 3.29 obscured by solvent, correlatedto the C-atom resonating at d(C) 67.7), and, finally, two H-atoms (double doublets atd(H) 3.73 and 3.58), assigned to the C-atoms resonating at d(C) 80.0 and 74.2,respectively. In the upfield region, five Me singlets at d(H) 1.69, 1.11, 1.03, 0.90, and0.68, correlated, in the HSQC, with the C-atom resonances at d(C) 19.9, 17.7, 16.8, 17.5,and 13.0, respectively, were identified. The 1H,1H-COSY experiment showed thefollowing correlations: HC(3) (d(H) 3.58) with CH2(2) (d(H) 1.66 – 1.60), whichshowed a cross-peak with CH2(1) (d(H) 1.68 – 1.63 and 0.95 – 0.89); HC(16) (d(H)3.73) with CH2(15) (d(H) 1.82, 1.45 – 1.40); and HC(19) (multiplet at d(H) 2.50 – 2.45)with HC(18) (d(H) 1.58 – 1.50) and CH2(21) (d(H) 2.05 – 2.02, 1.48 – 1.41). TheHMBC experiment furnished useful data to solve the structure. In fact, the sp2-C-atomC(29) correlated with Me(30) (d(H) 1.69) and the HC(19) (d(H) 2.50 – 2.45). The H-atoms of Me(30) were also correlated with the C-atoms resonating at d(C) 151.6(C(20)) and 49.6 (C(19)), while HC(19) also displayed correlations with C-atoms, atresonating d(C) 46.2, 33.9, and 19.9, assigned to C(17), C(22), and C(30), respectively.Moreover HC(3) (d(H) 3.58) and CH2(23) (d(H) 3.52, 3.29), in the same HMBCexperiment, gave cross-peaks with C-atoms resonating at d(C) 49.4, 43.9, and 13.0,assigned to C(5), C(4), and C(24), respectively. Finally, HC(16) (d(H) 3.73) andCH2(28) (d(H) 4.10 and 3.44) gave cross-peaks with C(22) and those, resonating atd(C) 49.8 and 46.2, assigned to C(18) and C(17), respectively. These data were inaccordance with a lupane triterpene structure. The relative configurations of thestereogenic C-atoms were determined by a NOESY experiment. The H-atoms ofMe(27) showed NOE with the HC(16), indicating a b-configuration of the OH group.These data allowed us to determine the structure of 3b,16b,23,28-tetrahydroxylup-20(29)-ene for this compound.Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 96 (2013)1042We thank the Associazione Italiana per la Promozione delle Ricerche su Ambiente e Salute umana(AIPRAS-Onlus) for financial support, and CIMCF (Centro Interdipartimentale di MetodologieChimico-Fisiche) of University of Naples Federico II.Experimental PartGeneral.
