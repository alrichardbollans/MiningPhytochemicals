Crotodichogamoin B is an important biosynthetic intermediate of the crotofolane class and this is the first report of patchoulene sesquiterpenoids from the genus.   Compounds were tested at one concentration, 1x10-5 M, in the NCI59 cell one-dose screen but did not show significant activity snd were also evaluated for their cytotoxicity against Caco-2 cell lines using the neutral red assay.  10-epi-Maninsigin D reduced Caco-2 cell viability at 10, 30 and 100 µM, with values of decreased viability of 28%, 48% and 43% respectively.  None of the other tested compounds showed significant activity.

Introduction  The genus Croton is one of the largest of the Euphorbiaceae family with more than 1200 species occurring in the tropics and subtropics worldwide (Berry et al., 2005).  Several species of Croton are used in South America, Asia and Africa in traditional medicine to treat abdominal pain, abscesses, dyspepsia, gastric and duodenal ulcers, impetigo, (Giang et al., 2003), diabetes, diarrhoea, and as an analgesic (Suárez et al., 2003), to treat dysmenorrhoea (Thongtan et al., 2003), respiratory diseases (Aguilar-Guadarrama and Rios, 2004), rheumatoid arthritis, snake bites, stomach aches, jaundice (Huang et al., 2015), wounds (Lopes et al., 2004; Salatino et al., 2007), as a tonic and to improve digestion (Asare et al., 2011), and as a mild laxative (Ngadjui et al., 1999).  The sap of Croton lechleri Müll. Arg., known as “dragon’s blood”, is used as a household remedy to treat diarrhoea, stomach ulcers, pain and swelling of insect bites and herpes infections (Jones, 2003, Gupta et al., 2008; Sollmann, 1920).  Phytochemical studies of Croton have shown the presence of alkaloids, phenolics, terpenoids and volatile oils, with a wide range of diterpenoid classes predominating (Salatino et al., 2007).  Compounds from the Croton genus have been widely screened and have shown anti-angiogenic (Huang et al., 2015), antibacterial (Bayor et al., 2009), anti-inflammatory (Aguilar-Guadarrama and Rios, 2004), antinociceptive, (Suárez et al., ), antimalarial and antimycobacterial activity, and to show cytotoxicity towards Vero, KB and BC cell lines (Thongtan et al., 2003), to inhibit LPS-Induced NF-KB activation (Giang et al., 2003) and to be cytotoxic against human cervical carcinoma cells (Block et al., 2002).   Croton dichogamus Pax (Euphorbiaceae) grows as a shrub or tree in Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Somalia (Govaerts, 1999).  This species is used as a dietary additive to milk or meat soup by the Maasai and Batemi of Kenya and Tanzania respectively.  It is known as “Mhand” in Tanzania, where it is used to treat respiratory diseases by inhalation of smoke of the plant leaves (Mohagheghzadeh et al., 1999).  It is used to treat chest complaints, malaria and stomach upsets in the Samburu region of Kenya, where it is commonly known as “l-akirding’ai” (Fratkin, 1996).  In the Loitoktok district of Kenya, it is known as “Oloibor benek”, and is used to treat arthritis and gonorrhoea (Muthee et al., 2011).  A previous investigation of the leaves of C. dichogamus, collected in Kenya, led to the isolation two crotofolane diterpenoids, crotoxide A and B (Jogia et al., 1999).  In the present study, the root gave five previously unreported compounds, crotodichogamoin A (2) and B (3), 15,16-epoxy-3-hydroxy-5(10), 13(16), 14-ent-halimatriene-17, 12(S)-olide (5), 15,16-epoxy-5,13(16),14-ent-halimatriene-3-ol (6), and 1,3,5-cadinatriene-(7R),(10S)-diol 5  (19) together with 15 previously reported terpenoids.  We report the structures of these five compounds, the previously unreported NMR data of the known compound 15,16-epoxy-4(18),13(16),14-ent-clerodatrien-3α-ol (gbaninol) (11), along with the an evaluation of the cytotoxicity of compounds tested.    2. Results and discussion  The n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts of the root of Croton dichogamus were separated using flash chromatography followed by preparative thin layer chromatography and/or gravity column chromatography to yield five previously unreported (2, 3, 5, 6, and 19) and 15 known compounds.  The known compounds were identified from their spectroscopic data and by comparison against literature data, as crotohaumanoxide (1) previously isolated from Croton haumanianus (Tchissambou et al., 1990), depressin (4), a casbain diterpenoid previously isolated from the soft coral Sinularia depressa (Li et al., 2010), 15,16-epoxy-3α,4β-dihydroxy-13(16),14-ent-clerodadien-17,(12S)-olide (furocrotinsulolide A) (7) previously isolated from Croton insularis (Graikou et al., 2005), 15,16-epoxy-3-keto-13(16),14-ent-clerodadien-17,(12S)-olide (crotonolide E) (8) and 15,16-epoxy-3α-hydroxy-4(18),13(16),14-ent-clerodatrien-17,(12S)-olide (crotonolide F) (9) previously isolated from Croton laui (Liu et at., 2014), 3β,4β,15,16-diepoxy-13(16),14-ent-clerodadiene-17,(12S)-olide (10) previously isolated from Croton oblongifolius (Pudhom and Sommit; 2011), 15,16-epoxy-4(18),13(16),14-ent-clerodatrien-3α-ol (gbaninol) (11), 15,16-epoxy-13(16),14-ent-clerodadien-3-one (trans-cascarillone) (12) previously isolated from Croton sonderianus (McChesny and Silveira, 1990), 3β,4β,15,16-diepoxy-13(16),14-clerodadiene (13) previously isolated from Thysananthus spathulistipus (Harinantenaina et al., 2006), 4-patchoulene (cyperene) (14) and 4-patchoulen-3-one (cyperotundone) (15) previously isolated from Cyperus rotundus (Joseph-Nathan et al., 1984; Xu et al., 2009), 6α-methoxypatchoulan-4-ene (16) previously isolated from Croton muscicapa (Barreto et al., 2013), 4-isopropyl-1,6-dimethylnaphthalene (cadalene) (17) previously isolated from Siparuna macrotepala (El-Seedi, 1994), 1(6),7,9-cadinatriene-4α,5β-diol (4α,5β-corocalanediol) (18) previously isolated from Juniperus formosana (Kuo et al., 1990), and aleuritolic acid (20) previously isolated from many sources, including C. pseudopulchellus (Langat et al., 2012).  The structures of the patchoulenes (14-16) were determined with the assistance of the NMR Predict programme (Robien, 2014).  This is the first report of patchoulene sesquiterpenoids from Croton. Gbaninol (11) has been isolated previously from Gossweilerodendron 6  balsamiferum Harms (Caesalpiniaceae) (Ekong and Okogun, 1969), however, no NMR data has been reported for this compound.  The NMR spectra of compound 2 showed similarities to those of the co-isolated crotofolane, crotohaumanoxide (1) (Tchissambou et al., 1990).  HREIMS data showed an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 327.1590 indicating a molecular formula of C20H22O4.  The FTIR spectrum showed absorption bands at 1747 cm-1 for a carbonyl stretch, 1649 cm-1 for a double bond stretch, and 1269 cm-1 for an epoxide C-O stretch.  The 13C NMR spectrum showed twenty carbon resonances, which could be assigned using HSQC, COSY and HMBC experiments and by comparison with NMR data for crotohaumanoxide (1).  The C-1β acetate group present in compound 1 was missing and a ketone group (δC 206.1) occurred at this position in compound 2.  The presence of a furan ring was shown by resonances at δC 117.0 (C-15), δC 121.8 (C-14), δC 137.0 (C-16) and δC 150.4 (C-13) and the C-14, C-15 and C-16 resonances showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the 3H-17 resonance (δH 1.96).  The two H-12 resonances (δH 2.81, 2.95) showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-10 (δC 141.9), C-11 (δC 37.8), C-13 and C-14 resonances and correlations in the COSY spectrum with two H-11 resonances (δH 2.53, 2.78).  A pair of exomethylene proton resonances (δH 5.06, 4.67, bs, 2 H-18) showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-8 (δC 39.8), C-10 and C-11 resonances, confirming its placement at C-10.  The C-18 resonance (δC 116.9) showed correlations with the H-8 and two H-11 resonances, and the H-8 resonance showed further correlations with the C-1 (δC 206.1), C-4 (δC 65.8), C-6 (δC 61.5), C-7 (δC 49.0), C-9 (δC 66.1), C-10 and C-14 resonances and a correlation in the COSY spectrum with the H-7 resonance (δH 2.49, d, J=13.0 Hz).  The H-7 resonance showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-5 (δC 56.2), C-6, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-13, C-14, C-15 and C-20 resonances.  The chemical shifts of the C-9/C-4 and C-5/C-6 resonances indicated the presence of epoxides at these positions as in crotohaumanoxide.  The H-5 resonance occurred as a singlet (δH 3.29) and its assignment was confirmed by correlations with the C-4, C-6, C-9 and methyl C-20 (δC 8.9) resonances.  Both the C-4, C-9 and ketone carbon resonance showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the H-2 (δH 2.49) and two H-3 (δH 2.66 and 1.84) proton resonances.  The 3H-19 resonance (δH 1.11, d) showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-2, C-3 and the ketone carbon resonance, confirming the placement of the keto group at C-1.  The COSY spectrum showed coupling between the 3H-19/H-2 and H-2/two H-3 resonances.  The relative configuration was assigned using the NOESY spectrum.  Correlations were seen between the H-5/3H-20, 3H-7  20/H-8 and H-8/3H-17 resonances, and, therefore, they were assigned as β as in crotohaumanoxide (1).  Configurations at C-4 and C-9 could not be confirmed from the NOESY spectrum, but it was assumed that they would be the same as in the co-isolated crotohaumanoxide and the related crotocascarin A (Kawakami et al., 2013) with both the epoxide groups on the α-face. In both crotohaumanoxide and crotocascarin A the relative configuration was confirmed by X-ray analysis.   Compound 3, crotodichogamoin B, isolated as a yellow oil from the CH2Cl2 extract, was found to be an interesting crotofolane diterpenoid and a possible parent to the crotofolane class.  The HRMS data showed a [M+H]+ ion at m/z 295.1694 indicating a molecular formula of C20H22O2 and ten degrees of unsaturation.  The FTIR spectrum showed a strong carbonyl stretch band at 1730 cm-1.  The 13C NMR spectrum showed twenty carbon resonances, including two ketone group carbon resonances at δC 208.1 (C-1) and δC 202.5 (C-13).  Resonances due to furan ring carbons, present in 1 and 2, were not present. Vinyl methyl groups occurred at C-16 (δC 23.5) and C-17 (δC 22.1) and the HMBC spectrum showed correlations between the corresponding 3H-16 (δH 1.49), 3H-17 (δH 2.13) and C-15 (δC 147.5) and C-14 (δC 134.3) alkene carbon resonances.  The HMBC spectrum showed correlations between the C-14 and C-13 (δC 202.5) ketone carbonyl carbon resonance and the two H-12 resonances (δH 2.27 and δH 2.43).  The C-13 resonance also showed a correlation with the two H-11 resonances (δH 2.82 and δH 2.72), which showed correlations with the C-10 (δC 142.0) and C-18 (δC 114.8) resonances of the exomethylene group and the C-8 (139.2) aromatic ring carbon resonance. The 3H-20 resonance showed correlations with C-5 methine (δC 126.9) and C-6 (δC 137.9) and C-7 (δC 143.4) fully substituted carbon resonances.  The corresponding H-5 singlet resonance (δH 7.22) showed correlations with the C-3 (δC 34.4), C-4 (δC 131.0), C-6 (δC 137.9), C-7 (δC 143.4), C-9 (δC 153.3) and C-20 (δC 20.6) resonances.  The C-1 (δC 208.0) ketone carbonyl resonance showed correlations with the two H-3 (δH 2.26, 3.34), the H-2 (δH 2.72) and 3H-19 (δH 1.28, d, J=7.1) proton resonances in the HMBC spectrum.  The H-2 resonance showed correlations with the C-4 (δC 131.0) and C-9 (δC 153.5) resonances.  The configuration at C-2 in compound 3 was assumed to be the same as in compounds 1 and 2.     It has been proposed that crotofolones arise from geranylgeraniol cyclising to form cembranoids, from which casbenes, such as 4 co-isolated in this work, form. Bond formation between C4/C-9 gives the lathrane class, and further C-7/C-8 bond formation leads to the 8  jatrophanes. Cleavage of the C-13/C-15 bond leads to the formation of the crotofolanes (Kawakami et al., 2013). Oxidation to a keto-group at C-13 and cyclisation with C-16 leads to the formation of a furan ring. Intermediates to the furan ring formation have been reported from C. inularis   (Maslovskaya et al., 2014).   Compound 5, 15,16-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-5(10),13(16),14-ent-halimatriene-17,(12S)-olide, isolated as a white solid from the CH2Cl2 extract, was found to be a previously undescribed furanohalimane diterpenoid.  The HREIMS data showed a [M]+ ion at m/z 330.1830, indicating a molecular formula of C20H26O4.  The FTIR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3436 cm-1 for an OH stretch, 1731cm-1 for a carbonyl stretch and 1246 cm-1 for a C-O stretch.  The 1H NMR spectrum displayed three coupled broad singlet proton resonances at δH 6.42 (H-14), δH 7.45 (H-16) and δH 7.41 (H-15), indicative of a β-substituted furan ring.  An oxymethine proton resonance at δH 5.47 (dd, J=5.0, 12.0), which corresponded to the carbon resonance at δC 72.4, was assigned as H-12 as it showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-13 (δC 125.9), C-14 (C 108.8) and C-16 (139.7) resonances.  The H-12 resonance also showed correlations with a lactone carbonyl carbon resonance (δC 172.8) assigned as C-17, and the C-10 resonance (δC 132.1).  The C-17 resonance showed correlations with the H-8 (δH 2.31) and two H-7 resonances, and correlations were seen between the C-10 and 3H-20 (δH 1.19) and H-8 resonances.  The H-3 oxymethine proton resonance at (δH 3.46) showed correlations with the C-18 (C 20.4) and C-19 (24.5) methyl carbon resonances, C-1 (C 24.3) and C-2 (C 27.3) methylene carbon resonances and C-4 and C-5 carbon resonances (C 39.8 and C 135.1.  The placement of the double bond between C-5 and C-10 (δC 132.1) was confirmed by correlations between the C-10 and the 2H-1 (δH 2.08), one of the H-2 (δH 1.81), 2H-6 (δH 2.11 and 2.22) and 2H-11 (δH 1.82 and 2.32) resonances and between the C-5 and the 2H-1, H-3, H-6 and H-7 proton resonances  The coupling constants of the H-3 resonance (H 3.46, dd, J=3.3, 11.7 Hz) indicated the -orientation of H-3 (De, 1987; Graikou et al., 2005; Jones et al, 2007; Pudhom and Sommit, 2011).  Correlations were seen between the H-3/ 3H-19, 3H-19/ 3H-20, 3H-20/H-12 resonances and therefore, these were confirmed to be on the -face.  The specific rotation for compound 5 was found to be +56.4, indicating the compound belonged to the ent-series (Hara et al., 1995).    The HREIMS data for compound 6 gave a molecular formula of C20H30O2 for the compound ([M + Na]+ at m/z 325.2138).  The FTIR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3424 cm-1 for an OH stretch.  Three coupled proton resonances at δH 6.28 (H-14), δH 7.35 (H-9  15) and at δH 7.22 (H-16) showed that a β-substituted furan ring was present.  These resonances showed coupling in the HMBC spectrum with a methylene C-12 carbon resonance (C 18.5), and this, the absence of a lactone carbonyl carbon resonance, and the fact that four methyl groups were present in compound 6 as opposed to 3 in compound 5, indicated that the 17,12-lactone was not present.  The corresponding H-12 resonances (H 2.36, 2H) were seen to be coupled to the two H-11 resonances, which were not further coupled, confirming the halimane structure.  Coupling was seen in the COSY spectrum between the 3H-17 (δH 0.88, d, J=6.7)/H-8, H-8/2H-7 (H 1.85, 1.90) and H-7/H-6 (δH 5.56) resonances.  Thus a double bond was placed at C-5 (δC 142.5, C-5; C 121.0, C-6).  The C-5 resonance showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the H-3 (δH 3.49), 3H-18 (δH 1.07), 3H-19 (δH 1.15) and H-10 (H 2.31) resonances.   The C-10 resonance (δC 39.0) showed correlations with the 3H-20 (δH 0.71) and H-6 resonances.   The H-3 resonance occurred as a broad singlet (δH 3.49, brs W1/2=8.6), indicating a β-equatorial orientation (Graikou et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2004), supported by correlations seen in the NOESY spectrum between the H-3 and both the H-2 resonances (δH 1.72 and 1.89) (Graikou et al., 2005).  The H-3 proton resonance also showed correlations in the NOESY spectrum with the 3H-18 and 3H-19 resonances.  Correlations seen between the H-8 (δH 1.62)/H-10 (δH 2.31) and H-10/3H-18 (δH 1.07) resonances confirmed that they were on the same face of the molecule.     Compound 19, isolated as a yellow oily material, was found to be the C-10 epimer of the known maninsigin D which was isolated previously from Manglietia insignis Rehd (Magnoliaceae) (Shang et al., 2013).  The HREIMS data showed a [M-H]+ peak at m/z 233.1550, indicating a molecular formula of C15H22O2 for the compound.  The FTIR spectrum showed an OH stretch band at 3485 cm-1.  The 13C NMR spectrum showed six aromatic carbon resonances at δC 120.9 (C-2), δC 122.5 (C-5), δC 128.2 (C-3), δC 137.5 (C-4), δC 137.6 (C-1) and δC 138.9 (C-6) for one benzene ring, two oxygenated fully substituted carbon resonances at δC 75.9 (C-10) and δC 80.2 (C-7), and two aliphatic methylene group carbon resonances at δC 24.4 (C-8) and δC 30.5 (C-9), four methyl group carbon resonances and one methine group carbon resonance.  The 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of an isopropyl group at C-7 as in the co-isolated cadalene (17) and 4α,5β-corocalanediol (18) with two doublet methyl group proton resonances at δH 1.15 (d, J= 6.9 Hz, 3H-12) and δH 1.21 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 3H-13) and one methine proton resonance at δH 2.60 (hept, J = 6.9 Hz, H-11).  10  The H-11 resonance showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-6, C-7 and C-8 resonances.  A singlet methyl group proton resonance at δH 1.64 (3H-14) displayed correlations with the C-1, C-10, and C-9 (δC 30.5) resonances, confirming its assignment.  The COSY spectrum showed coupling between the H-2 (δH 7.21, d, J= 8.0 Hz) and H-3 δH (7.18, d, J= 8.0 Hz) resonances and between the two H-8 (δH 2.36, δH 1.49) and the two H-9 (δH 1.59 and δH 2.26) methylene proton resonances.  Thus the structure of this compound was shown to be 1,3,5-cadinatriene-7,10-diol.  Four possible diastereomers are possible, one of which, 1,3,5-cadinatriene-7β,10β-diol (maninsigin D), has been reported (Shang et al., 2013).  In order to confirm the structure, a 13C NMR spectrum was run in CD3OD to compare with the literature data of maninsigin D.  Comparison of 13C NMR chemical shifts of spectra run in CD3OD showed differences especially at C-10, C-7 and C-14 which occurred at δC 81.6, δC 77.3 and δC 19.5 for compound 19, and δC 73.5, δC 70.1 and δC 28.8 respectively for maninsigin D.  Shang et al. used ROESY experiments to assign the relative configuration of maninsigin D, and concluded that the 3H-14 and the isopropyl groups were cis to each other.  The NOESY spectrum of 19 showed no correlations between the 3H-14 resonance and the isopropyl group proton resonances (H-11, 3H-12 and 3H-13) as seen for manginsigin D, and this, in conjunction with the difference in 13C NMR chemical shifts, suggested that the 3H-14 and the isopropyl group were trans to each other.  Therefore, the absolute stereo structure for compound 19 would be either (7R,10S) (19A) or (7S,10R) (19B).  The specific rotation for compound 19 was -96.0, compared to -9.4 reported for maninsigin D.    The absolute configuration of compound 19 was determined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.  The experimental ECD curve showed negative Cotton effects at 201 nm (–18.68) and 307 nm (- 4.12) for compound 19.  The experimental ECD data was compared with calculated ECD curves for 3,5-cadinatriene-(7R,10S)-diol (19A) and 1,3,5-cadinatriene-(7S,10R)-diol (19B).  A systematic analysis of conformer distribution using the molecular mechanics force fields (MMFF) at ground state was undertaken using Spartan14 software.  MMFF analysis of 3,5-cadinatriene-(7R,10S)-diol (19A) gave 25 conformers, 21 of which were under 3 kcal/mol.  The M0001 (-4.01 kcal/mol) conformer, which was consistent with the NOESY NMR experimental data and had a Boltzmann distribution of 0.775, was subjected to TDDFT calculations using a B3LYP method at 6-311G level built into Gaussian09 software.  MMFF analysis of 1,3,5-cadinatriene-(7S,10R)-diol (19B) gave 24 conformers, 21 of which were under 3 kcal/mol.  The M0001 (-4.01 kcal/mol) conformer, which had a Boltzmann distribution of 0.777, was subjected to TDDFT calculations using the 11  B3LYP method at 6-311G level built into Gaussian09 software.  The calculated ECD curves for both diastereomers were compared to the experimental ECD curve for compound 19. The calculated ECD curve of 19B was found to be opposite and equal in intensity to the experimental curve but the calculated ECD curve for 19A was similar, (Figure 2) confirming the structure as 1,3,5-cadinatriene-(7R,10S)-diol.     Compounds 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 were screened in vitro for cell viability against Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell lines using the neutral red assay (Repetto et al., 2008).  The samples were tested at 100 µM to estimate their cytotoxicity and compared with actinomycyin at a concentration of 7.96 µM (10µg/ml) as a positive control as described in the Experimental Section. Only compound 19 reduced Caco-2 at 100 µM (Figure S4 in Supporting Information) and was further tested at five concentrations, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 µM.  Compound 19 reduced cell viability at 10 µM (Figure 3).  None of the compounds isolated have been screened previously for cytotoxicity although maninsigin D has been tested against HL-60, A-549, SW-480, SMMC-7721 and MCF-7 human cell lines by the MTT method and showed IC50 values > 40 µM (Shang et al., 2013) and the normal enantiomer of 12 showed cytotoxicity against BT-474, KATO-3, CHAGO, SW-620 and HEP-G2 human cancer cell lines with LC50 values of 3.26, 6.78, 6.67, 4.44 and 6.37 µg/mL (Pudhom and Sommit, 2011).    Compounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 19 and 20 were evaluated against the NCI59 developmental therapeutics program 59 cancer cell line screen at one dose of 1x10-5M (NCI DTP Developmental Therapeutics Program, 2016). The compounds did not meet the criteria for further testing (Supporting Information). The compounds isolated in this work are consistent with our previous investigations of African Croton species, which have been shown to yield a wide range of diterpenoid classes as the major constituents, along with sesquiterpenoids and common triterpenoids (Mulholland et al., 2010; Langat et al., 2011, 2012; Ndunda et al., 2016). 3. Experimental section  3.1 General Experimental Procedures  Optical rotations were measured at room temperature on a JASCO-P-1020 polarimeter and IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer (2000 FTIR) spectrophotometer using KBr discs.  ECD spectra were measured on a Chirsascan CD spectrometer.  1H, 13C and 2D 12  NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III NMR spectrometer, operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.76 MHz for 13C, using standard experiments from the Bruker pulse programs library.  Chemical shifts are reported in ppm () referencing the solvent signal (CDCl3) as internal standard respect to TMS (0 ppm), and coupling constants (J) are measured in Hz.  HREIMS was performed on a Bruker MicroToF Mass Spectrometer, using an Agilent 1100 HPLC to introduce samples.   3.2 Plant Material  The root of Croton dichogamus Pax was collected in Wamunya, in the Machakos area of Kenya (1.41°S, 37.62°E) and identified by Mr. Patrick Mutiso of the University Herbarium, School of Biological Studies, University of Nairobi, Kenya. A voucher specimen (BN 2010/13) was deposited at the Herbarium, School of Biological Studies, University of Nairobi. 3.3. Extraction and Isolation  The ground root (1 kg) of Croton dichogamus Pax was extracted at room temperature on a shaker for 24 h successively with n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, to yield, after evaporation of the solvents, n-hexane (8.5 g), CH2Cl2 (20.0 g) and MeOH (25.6 g) extracts.  The crude extracts were separated using medium pressure flash chromatography (Grace Reveleris X2) over silica gel using a n-hexane/CH2Cl2/ MeOH step gradient and collecting 20 mL fractions.  The compounds were detected using an ELSD detector at three wavelengths, 320, 280 and 254 nm.  Subsequent purifications were carried out using preparative thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60 F254 coated aluminium backed TLC sheets) and/or 1 cm diameter column, which was packed with Sephadex (LH 20) in MeOH/ CH2Cl2 or silica gel (Merck Art. 9385).  Detailed extraction procedures are provided as Supporting Information (Schemes S1.1, S1.2 and S1.3).  The n-hexane extract contained cadalene 17 (3.9 mg), 6α-methoxy-patchoulan-4-ene (6α-methoxycyperene) 16 (7.7 mg), depressin 4 (6.0 mg), 3β,4β,15,16-diepoxy-13(16),14-clerodadiene 13 (4.3 mg), crotodichogamoin A 2 (6.2 mg), 1,3,5-cadinatriene-(7R,10S)-diol 19 (3.1 mg), crotodichogamoin B 3 (8.0 mg), 3β,4β,15,16-diepoxy-13(16),14-ent-clerodadiene-17,(12S)-olide 10 (4.2 mg), acetyl aleuritolic acid 20 (13.5 mg), 15,16-epoxy-3-hydroxy-5(10),13(16),14-ent-halimatriene-17,(12S)-olide 5 (2.8 mg) and 4-patchoulen-3-one 15 (3.2 mg).

Cytotoxicity Assay Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells (CACO-2 (ECACC 86010202) from Public Health England, UK) were cultured in Eagles’ Modified Essential Medium supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and maintained in 5% CO2/95% air in an incubator at 37°C.  Cells were plated in 96 well plates at 2x104 cells/well and incubated for 48 hours.  Cells were then treated for 48 hours with one of the following, in 4 replicates: culture medium alone (untreated control); 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control; maximum DMSO exposed to cells); actinomycin D 10  µg/ml (positive control); test substances at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 µM (diluted from a 100 mM stock in DMSO).  Cells were washed with PBS, and neutral red (25 µg/ml in culture medium, diluted from a stock of 2.5 mg/ml in ultrapure water) was added for 3 hours, cells were washed with PBS, and neutral red extracted in 50% ethanol/water with 1% acetic acid.  Absorbance was read at 540 nm.  Data are from 2-3 independent experiments (different cell passages).  The mean absorbance of wells without cells (blank) was subtracted from all other readings.  Replicates were averaged to give one treatment value per plate.  All plate treatment values were divided by the mean value of vehicle-treated cells on the same plate, so data was normalised as percentage of maximum cell viability.
