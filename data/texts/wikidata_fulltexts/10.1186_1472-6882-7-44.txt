Abstract
Background: Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc) is a natural dietary component with antioxidant and
anticarcinogenic properties. The ginger component [6]-gingerol has been shown to exert anti-
inflammatory effects through mediation of NF-κB. NF-κB can be constitutively activated in
epithelial ovarian cancer cells and may contribute towards increased transcription and translation
of angiogenic factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ginger on tumor cell growth
and modulation of angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells in vitro.
Methods: The effect of ginger and the major ginger components on cell growth was determined
in a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines. Activation of NF-κB and and production of VEGF
and IL-8 was determined in the presence or absence of ginger.
Results: Ginger treatment of cultured ovarian cancer cells induced profound growth inhibition in
all cell lines tested. We found that in vitro, 6-shogaol is the most active of the individual ginger
components tested. Ginger treatment resulted in inhibition of NF-kB activation as well as
diminished secretion of VEGF and IL-8.
Conclusion: Ginger inhibits growth and modulates secretion of angiogenic factors in ovarian
cancer cells. The use of dietary agents such as ginger may have potential in the treatment and
prevention of ovarian cancer.
Background
In the United States, ovarian cancer is the most lethal
gynecologic malignancy and represents the fifth leading
cause of cancer death among women[1]. Key goals in the
management of this disease are prevention, early detec-
tion, and prolongation of disease-free intervals and over-
all survival upon development of the disease. Most
primary ovarian cancers arise from malignant transforma-
tion of the surface epithelium. Although the specific
molecular events responsible for this transformation
remain unknown, two general theories have been pro-
posed: incessant ovulation [2,3] and excess gonadotropin

secretion[4]. Ovulation is essentially a natural inflamma-
tory process; therefore a pro-inflammatory state is felt
contribute to ovarian carcinogenesis[5,6]. There is ample
evidence that inflammation is causally linked to carcino-
genesis [7] in other tumor types, and targeting mediators
of inflammation has been used as a strategy to both pre-
vent and treat cancer.
Our understanding of ovarian cancer carcinogenesis is
limited. Many of the genes that mediate inflammation
and adaptive survival strategies in cancer cells including:
self-sufficient growth, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory
signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative poten-
tial, and sustained angiogenesis,[8] are under the tran-
scriptional control of NF-κB [9]. Constitutive activation of
NF-κB has been described in many tumor types including
ovarian cancer [9], suggesting that targeting NF-κB may
have anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects in this
tumor type.
Of late, several plant-derived extracts have been evaluated
as possible inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway. Ginger root
(Zingiber officinale radix Roscoe) and its main poly-phe-
nolic constituents (gingerols and zerumbone) have anti-
oxidant [10-15], anti-inflammatory [16-19], and anti-car-
cinogenic activity [20-24]. In particular, ginger root and
its constituents can inhibit NF-κB activation induced by a
variety of agents [25-28], and has been shown to down
regulate NF-κB regulated gene products involved in cellu-
lar proliferation and angiogenesis, including IL-8 [29],
and VEGF[30]. These factors have also been shown to pro-
mote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and affect
apoptotic response in ovarian cancers.
Among the myriad of pro-angiogenic cytokines known to
induce tumor angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) is the best characterized. In vitro and in vivo
studies have shown that VEGF is critically involved in var-
ious steps of ovarian cancer carcinogenesis, and recent
studies indicate that serum VEGF is an independent prog-
nostic factor for patients with all stages of ovarian cancer
[31]. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was originally found to function
as a macrophage derived pro-angiogenic factor [32], and
has since been shown to affect cancer progression through
mitogenic, angiogenic and motogenic effects[33].
Increased blood levels of IL-8 have been found in ovarian
cancer patients [34], and IL-8 has been shown to stimulate
proliferative growth in ovarian cancer cells in vitro[35].
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ginger
could exert inhibitory effects on cell growth, and modu-
late the production of angiogenic factors in epithelial
ovarian cancer cells. Our data reveals that ginger signifi-
cantly inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth, and that the
major bio-active component of ginger is 6-shagoal. More-
over, ginger inhibits NF-κB activation and subsequent
secretion of the angiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF in ovar-
ian cancer cells.
Methods
Chemicals
Dried whole ginger root powder extract (1:1 extraction
solvent: ethanol 50 percent/water 50 percent {}) stand-
ardized to 5% gingerols, was obtained from Pure Encap-
sulations, Inc (Sudbury, MA.). All studies were conducted
using a single batch of ginger root extract. Content of gin-
gerols in the ginger root extract were independently veri-
fied using appropriate high performance liquid
chromatography methods [36]. The total gingerol content
in the ginger root extract (12.3 mg/250 mg (4.9 percent)
was confirmed the end of the study at Integrated Bio-
molocule (Tuscon, AZ). For in vitro studies, a stock solu-
tion was prepared by vortexing 50 mg of powder into 1 ml
of aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Insoluble partic-
ulates were centrifuged to the bottom of the eppendorf
tube and the supernatant was then further diluted into cell
culture media in the concentrations described. Cisplatin
was obtained from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH.)
Ginger standards 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol and
6-shogaol were purchased from ChromaDex (Santa Ana,
CA.) Standards were solubilized in DMSO and molarity
was determined per supplier recommendations. Sul-
forhodamine B was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St.
Louis, MO.)
In Vitro Growth Inhibition Assays
The Sulfhodamine B assay was used according to the
method of Skehan et al.[37]. Cells were plated in a 96 well
format (3 × 103 cells/well) and twenty-four hours after
plating, DMSO, ginger, or ginger component standards
for indicated time periods. At the end of drug exposure,
cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid and stained
with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO), dissolved in 1% acetic aid (100 μl/well) for 30 min-
utes, and subsequently washed with 1% acetic acid. Pro-
tein-bound stain was solubilized with 150 μl of 10 mM
unbuffered Tris base, and cell density was determined
using a colorimetric plate reader (wavelength 570 nm).
All samples were run in triplicate. Cell number and viabil-
ity of treated cells were confirmed using the trypan blue
dye exclusion assay.
Cell Lines, Plasmids and Immunoblotting
SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells were obtained from the Amer-
ican Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA.) Dr. K. Cho
(University of Michigan) generously provided A2780,
CaOV3, and ES2 cell lines. SKOV3, CaOV3, and ES-2 cells
were originally harvested from patients with recurrent
ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2007, 7:44 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/7/44

units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitro-
gen Corporation, Grand Island, NY.) Human ovarian sur-
face epithelial cells were obtained, after Institutional
Review Board approval, from patients undergoing surgery
for non-ovarian cancer gynecologic indication. Cells were
initially cultured in Medium 199/105 (1:1) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin and EGF 10 ng/ml during pri-
mary culture. After establishing adequate growth, cells
were cultured with the above media, excluding EGF, prior
to use in assays[38]. CaOV3 and SKOV3 cell lines were
transfected with the indicated expression plasmid using
LipofectAMINE Plus, or AMAXA electroporation respec-
tively.
NF-κB promoter-dependant Luciferase Reporter Gene 
Activation
CaOV3 and SKOV3 cells were plated in 12 well plates.
Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were transfected the
reporter plasmid pBVIx-Luc. This plasmid contains six NF-
κB recognition sites within the promoter sequence linked
to the luciferase reporter gene, and was generously pro-
vided by Dr. Valerie Castle (University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, MI). Following transfection, cells cultured over-
night, then treated with DMSO vehicle control or ginger
(75 μg/ml). Following incubation with ginger for 6 hours,
cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was deter-
mined using a Monolight 2010 luminometer.
VEGF and IL-8 ELISA
Production of VEGF and IL-8 was determined in A2780,
CaOV3, ES2, and SKOV3 cells. IL-8 concentrations were
undetectable (<0.05 pg/ml) in A2780 and CaOV3 cells
lines (data not shown). Cells were cultured in a 96 well
format overnight, and then treated with DMSO vehicle
control or ginger (75 μg/ml). After 48 hours, cell superna-
tant was removed and assayed using a commercial ELISA
kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Assays were
performed in triplicate and concentrations of VEGF and
IL-8 (pg/ml) were compared with standard curves
obtained with human recombinant VEGF165 and IL-8 pro-
vided with the kit.
Statistical analysis
Standard analysis of variance techniques were used to
compare between cell types, or culture conditions,
depending on the analysis of interest. An overall F-test was
used to determine if there was at least one significant dif-
ference between the groups tested. Tukey's honestly signif-
icantly different (HSD) multiple comparison procedure
was used to determine significant pairwise comparisons,
while assure the overall type I error rate was 5% or less.
When the comparisons of interest were between treat-
ments and the control condition alone, Dunnett's multi-
ple comparisons technique for a single control was used.
Results
Ginger inhibits growth in ovarian cancer cells as compared 
to non-transformed ovarian epithelial cells
Continuous exposure to ginger extract resulted in a
marked reduction in cell growth after 1–5 days of expo-
sure in A2780 ovarian cancer cells (Figure 1A, p < .0001 at
all doses and time points). We tested additional ovarian
cancer cell lines to determine if this was an effect unique
to the A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Ginger treatment
resulted in similar effects in all cell lines tested, including
the chemoresistant cell lines SKOV3 and ES-2[39] (Figure
1B,C, p < .05 for all doses and time points). Untrans-
formed human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSE)
were minimally affected by ginger extract exposure at days
1 and 3, and showed some inhibition in growth by day 5
(Figure 1D, p > .05 for days 1 and 3, p < .05 for day 5). To
confirm that ginger treatment inhibited cell growth,
treated cells were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion as
well. As expected, ginger treatment resulted in a profound
inhibition of cell proliferation and growth at doses of 50
μg/ul and higher (Figure 2).
To determine whether lower doses of ginger could also
inhibit cell growth, an extended range of concentrations
was tested. In the A2780 and ES-2 cell lines, ginger con-
centrations of less than 50 μg/ml did not significantly
impact cell growth, whereas in the SKOV3 cell line, some
inhibition of cell growth was seen with ginger concentra-
tions as low as 30 μg/ml (Figure 3 and data not shown).
6-Shogaol is the most active of the individual ginger 
components tested in ovarian cancer cells
Previous investigators have shown bio-activity of various
individual ginger components in several tumor types
[30,40-43]. To determine the relative bio-activity in ovar-
ian cancer, A2780 ovarian cancer cells were treated with 6-
, 8- and 10-gingerol as well as 6-shogaol. In contrast to
other published findings, we found that 6-, 8- and 10-gin-
gerol had no effect on the growth or viability of ovarian
cancer cells (p > .05 at all time points). Treating cells with
whole ginger extract or 6-shogaol resulted in profound
growth inhibition (Figure 4A, p < .05 at all time points for
both ginger and 6-shogaol treated cells). Morphologically,
cells treated with ginger appeared markedly growth inhib-
ited, similar to cisplatin treated cells (Figure 5). Cells cul-
tured with vehicle control (DMSO) continued to
proliferate.
We next determined if continuous exposure to individual
ginger components was necessary to cause the growth
inhibitory effect seen in ovarian cancer cells. Similar to the
use of whole ginger root extract, continuous exposure to
6-shogaol was necessary to cause the growth inhibitory
effect seen in ovarian cancer cells. We treated cells with
ginger and individual ginger components for 24 hours,BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2007, 7:44 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/7/44

after which the cells were washed and media was changed.
Once ginger or 6-shogaol was removed from the media,
cell growth resumed (Figure 4B).
Ginger inhibits NF-κB in ovarian cancer cells
Because we found that ginger markedly suppressed ovar-
ian cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and several genes that
regulate proliferation are regulated by NF-κB, we hypoth-
esized that ginger may mediate its anti-neoplastic activity
in ovarian cancer cells though modulation of this path-
way. Constitutive activation of NF-κB has been described
in many tumor types including ovarian cancer[9], suggest-
ing that targeting NF-κB may have an anti-neoplastic
effect in this tumor type. Natural products such as ginger,
or ginger components such as zerumbone can inhibit NF-
κB in other cell types [16,44,45]. We chose two chemore-
sistant ovarian cancer cell lines (CaOV3 and SKOV3) to
evaluate the effect of ginger treatment on activation of NF-
κB. As shown in Figure 6, treatment with ginger extract
resulted in a significant inhibition of NF-κB activation in
CaOV3 and SKOV3 cell lines

tein from tumor cells themselves is thought to be crucial
for these effects[46,47]. In ovarian cancer patients, ele-
vated IL-8 expression has been found in ascites as well as
in serum[33]. Furthermore, IL-8 has been shown to stim-
ulate proliferative growth in ovarian cancer cells in
vitro[35]. Because IL-8 secretion is thought to be regulated
in part by NF-κB, and ginger can clearly inhibit NF-κB in
ovarian cancer cells, we hypothesized that ginger could
also inhibit IL-8 secretion. Using a representative panel of
ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that A2780 and CaOV3
cells produced negligible amounts of IL-8 (<0.05 pg/ml),
whereas the cell lines ES-2 and SKOV3 had high constitu-
tive expression of IL-8 (Figure 7A). Treatment with ginger
resulted in significant inhibition of IL-8 production in the
ES-2 and SKOV3 cell lines (p < .05 for both cell lines).
VEGF, the most important inducer of angiogenesis, is also
under transcriptional control of NF-κB[9]. Serum VEGF
levels as well as tumor expression of VEGF are associated
with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients [31], and
inhibition of VEGF function using Avastin™ has shown
promise in the treatment of ovarian cancer patients[48].
Because ginger treatment resulted in inhibition of NF-κB,
we next sought to determine whether ginger could simi-
larly inhibit VEGF in ovarian cancer cells. In all cell lines
tested, there was high endogenous production of VEGF,
and ginger treatment resulted in inhibition of VEGF secre-

tion. Inhibition of VEGF secretion was most evident in the
ES-2 cell line (p = .007), as compared to the other cell
lines tested (p = .19, .18, and .07 for A2780, CaOV3, and

Discussion
The analysis of epidemiologic data and disparities in glo-
bal incidence of ovarian cancer may provide clues to
uncover environmental and biologic factors that contrib-
ute towards the development of ovarian cancer. Dietary
prevalence of foods such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin,
chilies and green tea are thought to contribute to the
decreased incidence of colon, gastrointestinal, prostate,
breast and other cancers in South East Asian countries
[49]. Accumulating evidence suggests that many dietary
factors may be used alone or in combination with tradi-
tional chemotherapeutic agents to prevent or treat cancer.
The potential advantage of many natural or dietary com-
pounds seems to focus on their potent anticancer activity
combined with low toxicity and very few adverse side
effects.
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death
among patients with gynecologic cancers. Despite multi-
ple modalities of treatment including surgery and chemo-
therapy, ovarian cancer patients continue to have one of
the lowest 5-year survival rates [1]. The significant mor-
bidity and limited success of surgery and chemotherapy
for ovarian cancer has led to searches for alternative ther-
apies. Recently, ginger root and its main poly-phenolic
constituents (gingerols and zerumbone) been shown to
exhibit anti-inflammatory [16-19], and anti-neoplastic
activity [20-24] in several cell types through inhibition of
the transcription factor NF-κB [25-28]. NF-κB plays an
important role in tumorigenesis, given its ability to con-
trol the expression and function of numerous genes
involved in cell proliferation, sustained angiogenesis, and
evasion of apoptosis. Different tumor types, including
ovarian cancer, have been shown to express high constitu-
tive NF-κB activity[9]. In this study we show that ginger
blocks NF-κB activation in ovarian cancer cells, resulting
in inhibition of NF-κB regulated gene products involved
in cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.
Many of the pathways that mediate adaptive survival strat-
egies in cancer cells are under the transcriptional control
of NF-κB [9]. We have shown here that in ovarian cancer
cells, NF-κB is constitutively activated, and blocking NF-
κB activation with ginger results in suppressed production
of NF κB regulated angiogenic factors and selectively
inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth. We have found that
ginger selectively inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth, as
compared to non-transformed ovarian epithelial cells.
Previous reports indicate that the ginger component 6-
shogaol induces cell death in chemoresistant hepatoma
cells [50], yet inhibits cell death in non-neoplastic spinal
cord cells [51], suggesting that ginger and ginger compo-
nents' effects are cell type specific. The apparent contradic-
tory findings may be due to a differential effect of ginger
on transformed cells (i.e. cancer cells) vs. untransformed
cells. Phytochemicals such as ginger, generally have mul-
tiple molecular targets. This pleiotropism may constitute
an advantage in the treatment of ovarian cancer, where
multiple factors contribute towards the carcinogenic proc-
ess.
Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that ginger may exhibit
anti-neoplastic effects through the inhibition of NF-κB.
Further studies utilizing ginger in an in vivo model of ovar-
ian cancer will provide a platform for the development of
ginger as a therapeutic tool in this disease.

Ginger inhibits VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells. 
Ovarian cancer cells were cultured with DMSO (vehicle con-
trol) or Ginger (75 μg/ml) for 48 hours. Production of the 
angiogenic factor s IL-8 (A) and VEGF (B) were assayed using 
ELISA assays. (A.) Only ES-2 and SKOV3 cells expressed high 
IL-8 levels at Baseline, and ginger treatment resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in IL-8 production (p < .05 for both cell 
lines). (B.) VEGF production was reduced in all cell lines fol-
lowing ginger treatment (p = .19, .18, .007, and .07 for 
A2780, CaOV3, ES-2 and SKOV3 cells respectively).

Ginger inhibits NF-kB activation in ovarian cancer cells Figure 6
Ginger inhibits NF-kB activation in ovarian cancer 
cells. Representative ovarian cancer cell lines with high 
endogenous NF-kB activation, (A) CaOV3 and (B) SKOV3 
were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid 
(pBVIx-Luc). Cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle con-
trol) or ginger (75 μg/ml). NF-κB activation was determined 
by measuring relative luciferase activity 48 hours after treat-
ment. Luciferase activity is reported as arbitrary relative light 
units (mean +/- S.D.) Ginger treatment resulted in inhibition 
of NF-κB activation (p < .05 for both cell lines). Representa-
tive data is shown.
