ABSTRACT
Four gibberellins, GAS3, GA19, GA20, and GA1, were detected by
bioassay, chromatography in two HPLC systems, and combined
gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy-selected ion monitoring
(GC-MS-SIM) in etiolated soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) hypo-
cotyls. GC-MS-SIM employed [2H2J-labeled standards for each
endogenous gibberellin detected, and quantities estimated from
bioassays and GC-MS-SIM were similar. This result plus the
tentative detection of GA44 and GAe (standards not available)
indicates that the early-C-13-hydroxylation pathway for gibber-
ellin biosynthesis predominates in soybean hypocotyls. Other
gibberellins were not detected. Growth rates decreased after
transfer to low water potential (4,,) vermiculite and were com-
pletely arrested 24 hours after transfer. The GA, content in the
elongating region of hypocotyls had declined to 38% of the 0
time value at 24 hours after transfer to low 4,, vermiculite, a level
which was only 13% of the GA, content in control seedlings at
the same time (24 hours posttransfer). Rewatering seedlings
following 24 hours growth in low 4,, vermiculite resulted in a
complete recovery in elongation rate, an increase in GA, (20% at
2 hours, two-fold at 8 hours, eightfold at 24 hours), and a decrease
in ABA levels (tenfold at 2 hours). Treatment of well-watered
seedlings with the GA-synthesis inhibitor tetcyclacis (TCY) re-
sulted in lowered GA, levels and increased ABA levels. When
seedlings grown 24 hours in low 4,, vermiculite were rewatered
with TCY, recovery of the elongation rate was delayed and re-
duced, and the decline in ABA levels was slowed. Addition of
GA3 restored the elongation rate inhibited by TCY. Seedlings
were growth responsive to exogenous GA3, and this GA3-pro-
moted growth was inhibited by exogenous ABA. The data are
consistent with the hypothesis that changes in GA, and ABA
levels play a role in adjusting hypocotyl elongation rates. How-
ever, the changes observed are not of sufficient magnitude nor
do they occur rapidly enough to suggest they are the primary
regulators of elongation rate responses to rapidly changing plant
water status.
Hypocotyl elongation rates are greatly reduced when well-
watered soybean seedlings are transferred to low aI3 vermicu-

lite (,tw = -0.30 MPa). The inhibition of elongation can be
observed within the first hour after transfer, and complete
arrest in hypocotyl elongation occurs between 24 and 36 h
after transfer. Subsequently, elongation rates partially recover.
During the period following transfer, turgor pressure is main-
tained in the elongating zone (22) due to osmotic adjustment,
which occurs during the first 12 to 15 h (20).
Changes in the extensibility of the cell wall could be re-
sponsible, in part, for the observed decrease in cell elongation
rates. Cell wall extensibility is a function of a complex set of
metabolic processes (28), which may be mediated by plant
growth regulators (6, 7). For example, ABA, which has been
shown to decrease cell wall extensibility (6), accumulates in
the hypocotyl zone of elongation of seedlings transferred to
low 4, vermiculite (2). Its content doubles within 30 min of
transfer and continues to increase up to 74-fold by 24 h
posttransfer. The initial increase in ABA is temporally insep-
arable from the start of the growth inhibition and is not due
to a turgor loss in the elongating zone. Turgor loss, which is
considered to be a signal for induced ABA levels, does occur
in other parts ofthe seedling (22), suggesting that other tissues
may serve as the source ofthe accumulating ABA. In addition,
applied ABA has been shown to inhibit hypocotyl elongation
in well-watered seedlings (2).
Conversely, applied GA3, which has been shown to increase
cell wall extensibility (14, 15, 29), induces large increases in
the elongation rate of stem tissue in intact plants, particularly
mutants with low endogenous GA contents (19). In excised
oat internodes (15) and lettuce hypocotyls (14), applied GA3
results in dramatic increases in growth. GA3 induces growth
in lettuce hypocotyls with response times as short as 10 to 15
min without increasing either IAA content or synthesis (14).
Studies with dwarf mutants have identified GA, as the active
GA regulating shoot elongation in maize (24, 27), Brassica
(26), rice (see review in Phinney [24]), and pea (13). These
findings support a direct role for GA, in cell elongation of
intact shoots.
The goal of the research reported here was to identify
endogenous gibberellins in the elongating region of dark-
grown soybean hypocotyls and to relate their quantities to
hypocotyl elongation under well-watered and water-limited
growth conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General
To extract, detect, and quantify GAs from the elongating
regions of soybean hypocotyls, 3H-labeled GAs were added to

extracts as an internal standard to track progress through
chromatography and to estimate recovery. After initial puri-
fication steps, samples were submitted to HPLC and the
resulting fractions bioassayed. Active fractions were grouped,
again subjected to HPLC, and these new fractions were bioas-
sayed. Active fractions from this HPLC run were grouped,
supplemented with deuterated standard GAs, derivatized, and
assayed by GC-MS-SIM. This approach, adapted from Ko-
shioka et al. (16), allows the major bioactive GAs to be
detected and characterized as to HPLC retention time prior
to GC-MS-SIM.
After GAs had been detected by GC-MS-SIM, experiments
were conducted to determine whether changes in GA, levels
occur with changes in plant water status or TCY treatment.
For these experiments the GA isolation procedures were
streamlined by adding deuterated GA, at the time of extrac-
tion, conducting a single HPLC separation, grouping the GA1-
containing fractions only and subjecting them to GC-MS-
SIM.
Standard Growth Conditions
Soybean seedlings (Glycine max [L.] Merr. cv Williams:
Illinois Foundation Seed) were dark grown from seed at 29°C,
100% RH, in vermiculite, as previously described (20). Prior
to planting, seeds were soaked for 5 min in 1% NaOCl, then
rinsed with running tap water for 1 h. For the first 48 h, the
seedlings were grown in 0.1 mM CaCl2-saturated vermiculite.
Vermiculite was considered saturated when enough solution
had been added to allow for the vermiculite itself to be
saturated, and a small excess of solution pooled in the bottom
2 cm of the 10-cm-tall growth container. At 48 h, seedlings
were transplanted either to a similar saturated vermiculite (4&"
=
-0.01 MPa) or low water potential vermiculite (4/'W = -0.30
MPa). Water potentials were determined by thermocouple
psychrometry using the isopiestic method (5). In recovery
(rewater) experiments, seedlings were watered to saturation of
the vermiculite with 0.1 mm CaCl2 24 h after transfer to low
/w vermiculite. All seedling manipulation was performed at
100% RH under a green safelight (transmission 475-575 nm).
The elongating zone of the hypocotyl was experimentally
determined to be that portion ofthe hypocotyl between 8 and
23 mm below the hypocotyl-cotyledon axis. Plant hypocotyl
elongation was determined by direct measurement of seed-
lings at timed intervals.
Application of ABA, GA3, and TCY
(±)ABA (0.1 mm, 1 mM) and GA3 (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1
mM) (Sigma) were prepared in 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8),
0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The same buffer including Tween 20,
but without hormones, was used in control treatments. These
solutions were applied to seedlings by aerial spraying once
every 6 h for the entire test period. Enough solution was
applied to moisten the entire exposed portion of the plant.
No attempt was made to saturate the vermiculite with the
solution.
TCY (5-[4-chlorophenyl]-3,4,5,9, 10-pentaaza-tetracyclo-
5,4,1,026,081 I-dodeca-3,9-diene, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Fed-
eral Republic ofGermany) was solubilized in 1 mL ofacetone,
and mixed with 1 or 2 L ofdeionized distilled water to prepare
5, 50, and 500 ,M solutions. Seedlings to be treated with TCY
were grown under standard growth conditions for 48 h, then
depending on the experiment, were either transferred to ver-
miculite saturated with one of the TCY solutions, or trans-
ferred to low A vermiculite 24 h before rewatering to satu-
ration with one of the TCY-containing solutions.
GA Extraction and Purification
Hypocotyl segments from the zone of elongation were
excised (128 or 256 per treatment), frozen in liquid N2, and
lyophilized. After determination of dry weights, samples were
ground to fine powder in a chilled mortar and pestle with the
aid of acid-washed sand. The powdered tissue was extracted
with 10 mL of ice-cold 4:1 (v:v) CH30H:distilled water and
approximately 50,000 dpm each of [1,2-3H]GA, (31.5 Ci/
mmol) and [1,2-3H]GA4 (31.5 Ci/mmol) (both from Amer-
sham) was added as internal standards for determination of
recoveries and chromatographic markers. In the experiments
where the time course of GA, content was determined after
rewatering or transfer to TCY saturated vermiculite, 100 ng
of [ 17,1 7-2H]GA1 (synthesized by Prof. L. Mander, Australian
National University) was also added during the initial extrac-
tion. The tissue residue was then filtered off and reextracted
overnight at 5°C with 15 mL of the extraction solvent. The
methanolic extracts were combined and adjusted to pH 6.5
to 7.0 with 2 N NH40H.
The combined extracts were purified by a procedure mod-
ified from Koshioka et al. (17). Briefly, they were made up to
40 mL with additional 80% CH30H and passed through a 5-
g column of Davisil C18 (90-130 ,m, Alltech). The column
was rinsed twice with 10 mL of 80% CH30H and the com-
bined 80% eluate diluted with distilled water to equal 60%
CH30H. The 60% CH30H extract was passed through a
similar column and the column rinsed twice with 10 mL 60%
CH30H, followed by 100% CH30H. (This latter fraction
would contain kaurene and kaurenoic acid, but it was not
analyzed further.) In the time course experiments analyzing
only GA,, the second column was omitted and the 80% eluate
processed as described below. The 60% CH30H (or 80%
CH30H) column eluate was reduced to rotary flash evapora-
tion to the aqueous phase which was then frozen and lyophi-
lized. The residue was solubilized in a small amount of 80%
CH30H and dried onto celite with a warm air stream and a
hot plate. The celite was loaded onto a 5-g SiO2 partition
column, and GAs were eluted with 70 mL of 95:5 (v:v)
formate-saturated CH3CO2C2H5:hexane.
HPLC and Bioassay
The CH3CO2C2H5:hexane fraction was dried on a flash
evaporator and prepared for reverse-phase C18 HPLC (16).
The instrumentation consisted of a model 680 Automated
Gradient Controller, a U6K injector, a model 6000A pump,
a model 45 pump (Waters), and an ISCO fraction collector.
The extract was separated by HPLC on a 3.9 x 300 mm
,ABondapak C18 column (Waters) eluted at 1.5 mL/min with

the following gradient: 0 to 5 min, isocratic 28% CH30H in
1% aqueous acetic acid; 5 to 35 min, linear gradient from 28
to 86% CH30H; 35 to 36 min, 86 to 100% CH30H; 36 to 40
min, isocratic 100% CH30H. Fractions were collected every
2 min. The fractions were dried and GA-like biological activ-
ity detected with the dwarf rice bioassay (21), modified in that
the first leaf sheath length was measured after 48 h. To further
purify and separate coeluting GAs, fractions exhibiting bio-
logical activity were grouped within samples and separated
again by HPLC on a 4.6 x 150 mm 10 ,m Nucleosil N(CH3)2
column (Alltech) eluted isocratically with 0.1% acetic acid in
CH30H (30). Fractions were collected every 2 min and bioas-
sayed again. Recovery of the [3H]GAs used as internal stand-
ards was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry from
aliquots of the resulting fractions.
In the GA, time course experiments, the CH3CO2C2H5:
hexane fraction was processed by HPLC on the ,uBondapak
column isocratically eluted with 22% CH30H in 1% acetic
acid. The fractions containing the [3H]GA, internal standard
(21-23 min) were pooled and taken to dryness.
GC-MS-SIM
Concentrations of endogenous GAs in fractions exhibiting
significant biological activity or those corresponding to the
expected retention times of biologically inactive GAs (e.g.
GA8) were determined by GC-MS-SIM with deuterated inter-
nal standards as has been done previously (25, 26). Briefly, 50
ng of the appropriate deuterated GA ([17,17-2H2]GAI,19,20,53
synthesized by Prof. Mander) was added to the vial before
derivatization, except for those fractions from the experiments
which already contained [2H]GA1 (time course experiments).
The methyl esters were prepared with ethereal diazomethane
and, after drying with N2, freeze-drying, and resolubilizing in
50 ML pyridine, the samples were silylated with 100 ML of
N,N'-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1%
trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Pierce Chemical Co.). Sam-
ples were injected on-column on a 12 m, 0.2 mm i.d., 0.33
,um film thickness methyl silicone fused silica capillary col-
umn (HP-1, Hewlett-Packard). Hydrocarbon standards, pre-
pared from Parafilm, were coinjected with the sample to
determine KRIs (8). The GC (model 5890, Hewlett-Packard)
oven, after a 1-min hold at 60°C, was programmed at 15°C/
min to 200°C followed by 5°/min to 270°C. Helium head
pressure was adjusted to give a linear velocity through the
column of 40 cm/s. The GC was directly interfaced to a
5970B Mass Selective Detector (Hewlett-Packard). The MS
operating parameters were: interface and source temperature,
280°C; 70 eV ionizing voltage; dwell time, 100 ms. The
instrument was regularly tuned with the Autotune program
and operated at a photomultiplier voltage 200 mV above the
recommended voltage.
For the quantitation and characterization of endogenous
GAs, three ions of the endogenous species were measured
along with three ions for the deuterated species. Nonlabeled
GA standards were not available and, consequently, standard
curves could not be constructed. Quantitation was based on
the peak area ratios, with endogenous peak areas corrected
for any contribution from the deuterated species. For exam-
ple, the relative abundance of m/z 506 as a percentage of m/
z 508 in a standard run of [2H2]GA, is consistently less than
% (usually undetectable), and in this case no nondeuterated
GA1 is contributed by the [2H2]GA1 standard. Because an
excess of [2H2]GA standards was used, contribution of heavy
isotopes from endogenous GAs (i.e. m/z 508 for GA,) was
negligible and did not significantly affect the quantitation. In
all cases, the most prominent ion (usually M+) of the deuter-
ated and nondeuterated species was used for the quantitation
and the other ions for confirmation of identity.
Confidence in the GA data is based on the use ofthe double
internal standard (3H-GA, and 3H-GA4) in each sample,
similar results in duplicate experiments (Tables I, II, and III)
and uniform trends in the unduplicated time course experi-
ments (Table IV; Fig. 3). Growth data and ABA data are from
replicated samples and standard deviations are given.
ABA Determinations
ABA was extracted from plant tissue and analyzed by GLC
as previously described (2). An internal standard of(±)-[G3H]
ABA (69 Ci/mmol, 0.07 ng ABA, Amersham) was added
during the initial homogenization to determine ABA recov-
eries, which averaged 64%. The final ABA-containing extract
was methylated with ethereal diazomethane. Methylated sam-

ples were dried under N2 and dissolved in ethyl acetate with
endrin as an internal standard. Quantification of the methyl
ester of ABA was accomplished with a Tracor 540 gas chro-
matograph equipped with a 63Ni electron capture detector and
an OCI-3 on-column injector (Scientific Glass Engineering).
Quantitation and confirmation of the identity of ABA was
also performed on some samples with the GC-MS system
described above. GLC conditions were: Hewlett-Packard HP-
1 capillary column as above held isothermally at 80°C for 1
min and then temperature programmed from 80 to 1 800C at
25°C/min. At 1 80°C the rate of increase in temperature was
changed to 10°C/min. ABA was quantified in samples and
standards by monitoring m/z 190 and m/z 125 (ABA), and
m/z 263 (base peak of endrin). Dwell time for both ions was
100 ms.
RESULTS
Endogenous Gibberellins in Soybean Hypocotyl
Segments
Significant amounts of biologically active gibberellin-like
activity were present in extracts from the elongating region of
etiolated soybean hypocotyls. Up to 215 ng GA3 equivalents
per g dry weight were present (Table I). In addition to a peak
of activity at 12 to 14 min, which corresponds to the retention
time of3H-GA1 in this system, a large peak ofactivity occurred
around 22 to 30 min which corresponds to the retention times
of GA19, GA20, and GA53 determined in separate runs (Fig.
1). The addition ofdeuterated GA standards was purposefully
delayed until after this step so as not to compromise the
bioassays, while the amount of3H-GAs added was insufficient
to detect in the bioassay.
Sequential reverse phase C18 and Nucleosil N(CH3)2 HPLC
yielded GA-bioactive fractions of sufficient purity to allow
GC-MS-SIM. With the corresponding 2H-labeled GA added,
four GAs were detected: GA,, GA20, GA19, and GA53 (Table
II). Identification is based on similar chromatographic reten-
tion times in two HPLC systems, bioactivity on dwarf rice,
cochromatography on capillary GC, and similar relative abun-
dances of three characteristic ions on GC-MS. Endogenous
levels of GA20-like activity were relatively low, and the third,
least abundant, ion (m/z 403) was detected in amounts too
low to quantitate. However, the other ions (m/z 418 and 375)
were present at the same retention time as [2H2] GA20 at
similar abundances. We also noted three characteristic ions
for GA8 and GA44 at the expected KRI for each GA (11).
Since we did not have standards of GA8 and GA44, we could
not coinject standards with unknowns and compare relative
abundances of characteristic ions from the same MS on the
same analysis as was done for GA,, GA19, GA20, and GA53
(Table II). For that reason, data are not given for GA8 and
GA44. All of these detected GAs are members of the early 13-
hydroxylation pathway.
The full spectrum of GA activity was compared in two
experiments with similar results for the pattern of bioactivity
(Fig. 1), the percentage of recovery (Table I), the four GAs
detected (Table II), and the absence of other major GAs. No
evidence was obtained for the presence of other 3-OH, 3,13-
OH, or non-OH GAs, including GAI2, GAI5, and GA7, which
have been identified as endogenous in soybean cotyledons or
as metabolites of applied GAI2-7-aldehyde in cotyledons (3).
Thus, it appears that the early 13-hydroxylation pathway of
GA metabolism predominates in dark-grown hypocotyl tissue
of soybeans.
Growth Rates, Gibberellin Content, and Water Deficits
Hypocotyl elongation was unaffected when seedlings were
transferred to water-saturated vermiculite but was severely
inhibited after 24 h in seedlings transferred to low 4fw vermicu-
lite (Fig. 2). Recovery after rewatering is known to be complete
within 30 min (2) and proceeded, thereafter, at a linear rate
for at least 24 h (Fig. 2). Growth rate recovers with time in
seedlings in low APw vermiculite ([2]; Fig. 2).
Seedling gibberellin content varied both with time and
water content of the vermiculite. GA, and GA,9 were the
most abundant endogenous GAs in both experiments (Table
III). During the first 24 h after transfer, GA1 levels increased
over twofold in seedlings growing in saturated vermiculite,
while GA19 levels remained constant or declined slightly.

a Abundances for the [1H] endogenous GAs have been corrected for the contribution from the [2H]
species. Sample names (e.g. 0 h GA,-like) are based on the expected elution of the GA from HPLC and
show which internal standard (IS) was used for quantitation. Trace-ion peak present but too small for
accurate quantitation. b Seedlings harvestd after grown for 24 h in water saturated vermiculite after
transplanting (wet) or harvested at the time of transplanting (0 h).
Although there were differences in the absolute amounts of
GAs between the two experiments, the trends ofchanges were
similar (Table III).
Growth of soybean seedlings in low 4w vermiculite for 24
h lowered the GA, content to 38% of the 0 h values and to
13% of the level observed in well-watered seedlings of the
same age (Table III). The GA19 content also declined during
growth in low {w vermiculite. When the GA, content was
calculated on a per segment basis, as opposed to a dry weight
basis, the same trends were observed (Table III).
Time Course of Changes in GA1 Levels, ABA Levels, and
Growth Rates
In order to further characterize the relationship between
GA, levels and elongation of soybean hypocotyls, additional
experiments were conducted involving the GA biosynthesis
inhibitor TCY. Both GA, and ABA levels were altered by
TCY. GA1 decreased by about one-third from 0 to 8 h and
remained stable up to 24 h (Fig. 3). By 48 h, GA, had
decreased to less than one-fifth of the original value (Fig. 3).
GA, levels increased in control plants during the first 24 h
after transfer to vermiculite without TCY (Table III). ABA
levels of seedlings showed an increase 2 h after transfer to
TCY and rose to 1200 pg/mg dry weight after 8 to 12 h (Fig.
3). Then at 48 h, ABA declined to a level twofold higher than
it was initially. Thus, at 48 h, the growth rate of TCY-treated
plants was reduced 30% from controls (Fig. 2), while GA,
levels were reduced to about one-fifth of their original values
(Fig. 3), and ABA levels were doubled (Fig. 3).
When seedlings exposed to low 4/w vermiculite for 24 h were
rewatered, substantial changes occurred in ABA and GA,
levels. After 2 h, ABA levels decreased 10-fold, but the pres-
ence of 50 gM TCY, either with or without added GA3,
blocked much of this decrease (Table IV). GA, increased by
20% 2 h after rewatering and more than doubled by 8 h. The
increase in GA, continued to almost 8-fold at 24 h (Table
IV). The general trend was that rewatering increased the
growth rate (Fig. 2), decreased the level of ABA (Table IV),
and increased the level of GA, (Table IV). Another way to
evaluate the short-term changes in GA, levels following re-
watering is to average the data from all the experiments where
relevant observations were made. The value for 0 h (four
experiments) was 76.2 (±19.3) pg/mg dry weight, while after
24 h in low /w vermiculite the level of GA, was 25.3 (±6.49)
(three experiments). Two h after rewatering the average was
33.4 ± 12.6 (two experiments). This represents a 32% increase
in GA, within 2 h after rewatering. Although the standard
errors for the averaged 24 h and 2 h post-rewatering obser-
vations overlap, the fact that the trend for increased GA,
levels clearly continues with time (Table IV) suggests that the
differences at 2 h are real.
When seedlings were rewatered with 50 ,tM TCY, they
elongated to only 57% of the length achieved by rewatered
controls over 20 h (Fig. 2). Rewatering with 500 ,uM TCY
resulted in the same level of inhibition, while rewatering with
5 jiM TCY resulted in elongation indistinguishable from con-
trols (data not given). The increase in growth rate of TCY-
rewatered seedlings lagged behind that of seedlings given water

alone (Fig. 2). TCY reduced the rate of elongation of well-
watered seedlings transferred to well-watered vermiculite with
TCY, after a lag of at least 10 h (Fig. 2). The addition of 1
mM GA3 to the 50 uM TCY rewater solution resulted in an
elongation rate which was 91% of the control rate over the
first 20 h (data not given).
Applied GA3 and Hypocotyl Elongation
Soybean seedlings (48-h-old) grown under these conditions
responded to GA3. Over 48 h, 0.01 and 1 mM GA3 promoted
elongation by 14 and 25% over control rates (data not given).
Applied ABA was capable of reversing this growth promotion
(data not given).
DISCUSSION
GC-MS-SIM has been used to detect and quantify GAs
when deuterium-labeled, authentic GAs were available as
internal standards (25, 26). While more complete information
would be available from a full-scan mass spectrum, the infor-
mation available from a GC-MS-SIM analysis with heavy
isotope-labeled internal standards leaves little chance for er-
ror. In the present case, reproducible patterns of GA-like
bioactivity occurred after HPLC performed under two differ-
ent sets of conditions. Compounds from these bioactive frac-
tions coeluted with deuterium-labeled GA53, GA19, GA20, and
GA1, and gave the proper relative abundances for three major
fragments. Finally, quantitation from the GC-MS data yielded
results consistent with the bioassay data. The fact that all of
the GAs we recognized occurred in the same early 1 3-hydrox-
ylation pathway (24) adds to the reliability of the work. Work
with maize (24, 27), pea (13), rice (24), and Brassica (26)
mutants implicate the early- 13-hydroxylation pathway, par-
ticularly GA, as the regulator of shoot elongation (see review
in Phinney [24]).
GA1 and GA8 had previously been tentatively identified in
immature soybean seeds based on bioassay and HPLC data
(18). In addition, Birnberg et al. (3) fed radiolabeled GA12-7-
aldehyde to soybean cotyledons and. identified radiolabeled
GA12 and GA15 in extracts. They also identified GA7 as
endogenous in cotyledons. Of these GAs we found evidence
only for GA,. The fact that we used etiolated tissue, which
has been reported to contain higher GA levels than light-
grown tissues in Phaseolus coccincus seedlings (4), and that
we extracted only hypocotyls, may explain both the differ-
ences with the results of Birnberg et al. (3) and the success we
had in detecting endogenous GAs.
Previous work with this system showed that transfer of
seedlings from well-watered to low t'w vermiculite reduced
hypocotyl elongation rates and increased ABA levels (2). In
the present study, growth rates and GA, levels both declined
in response to low iw (Fig. 2; Table III). The rapidity of these
changes cannot be determined from the data available. There
is an approximately 8-h lag in inhibition of the growth rate
below the control (Fig. 2), while the earliest GA analysis was
at 24 h (Table III). There was some recovery in both the
growth rate of seedlings in low 4,w vermiculite by 48 h (Fig. 2;
[2]) and in GA, levels at 60 h (Table III). Previous studies of
the effects of water deficits on GA levels have been limited to
bioassay and immunoassay data and have produced conflict-
ing results (1, 12).
The dynamics of ABA and GA, levels were illustrated by
changes in their contents after rewatering and/or treatment
with the GA-synthesis inhibitor TCY. Rewatering resulted in
a rapid recovery of growth (less than 30 min) (2). There was
a rapid, dramatic decrease in ABA content at 2 h (Table IV),
while GA, increased, but less dramatically, rising 32% in 2 h.
The increase in GA1 levels continued and at 24 h it had
increased more than sixfold (Table IV).

Figure 3. GA, and ABA content of TCY treated seedlings. Seedlings
grown under standard growth conditions for 48 h were transferred
to vermiculite saturated with 50 AM TCY (O h). Each GA1 determination
(open circles) was made using the elongating section of 128 seed-
lings. ABA determinations (closed circles) represent the mean value
and standard deviations between two repeats using 16 seedlings per
measurement. The second ABA data point had a standard deviation
smaller than the size of the symbol, and the curve was arbitrarily
drawn between the second and third points.
initially increased the ABA level in hypocotyls. This is con-
sistent with reports that TCY inhibits Cyt P-450 mixed func-
tion oxidase-mediated reactions, including the breakdown of
ABA to phaseic acid (11, 33). Thus, TCY increases ABA
levels by sparing its catabolism (Fig. 3). The TCY effect on
GA, levels was less drastic; a decrease by about one-third was
evident at 8 h. TCY blocks the oxidative reactions of GA
biosynthesis between ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid (9).
It inhibits cell elongation (10) and has been shown to cause
dwarfed growth of Agrostemma githago while reducing the
endogenous GA content (32). Assuming that TCY inhibits
the recovery of GA, levels that occurs in rewatered plants
(Table IV) as it does in well-watered plants (Fig. 3), then
decreases in GA, and increases in ABA levels are consistent
with what occurs in seedlings exposed to low V6w vermiculite.
While changes in growth rates and hormone levels (GA,
and ABA) observed here are consistent with a causal relation-
ship, the details of the temporal relationships raise questions.
After rewatering, growth rates recover much more rapidly
than recovery to well-watered levels of either GA, (Table IV)
or ABA (2; Table IV). Details of the time course for GA1
changes when exposed to low 4,if are not available, but in this
case ABA changes appear less rapid than changes in growth
rate. From the data presented here and in an earlier report
(2), we can tentatively advance one of the following hy-
potheses: (a) that changes in growth rate following major
changes in water relations are not due to changes in GA or
ABA levels, and thus these hormones reflect growth rates but
do not initiate them, or (b) that changes in growth rates result
from a complex interplay between physical pressure for ex-
pansion (turgor) and the yield threshold ofthe cell walls which
is, in turn, influenced by hormones. The second explanation
is consistent with recent findings on the mechanism of cell
growth. Nonami and Boyer (23) found that, even in the
presence of positive turgor, the collapse of the 6 gradient

from the xylem to the expanding cells apparently inhibited
elongation. They used the same experimental system used in
the present investigation. If similar abrupt changes occur in
the i,', gradients and levels of turgor upon rewatering, then
those changes could explain the initial effects on growth rates.
Taylor and Cosgrove (29) have recently shown that GA3
increases the elongation ofcucumber seedlings by accelerating
biochemical processes which cause wall relaxation rather than
by altering osmotic or turgor pressure. However, these changes
take several hours to be expressed and may be related to
longer term alterations of growth at the whole plant level by
water deficit. In further regard to the second explanation,
although we have obtained evidence for changes in GA levels
with alteration of plant 41,, we do not know whether average
concentrations in bulked tissue such as whole hypocotyls
parallel physiologically active levels at the active site(s). Thus,
a decrease in absolute GA, levels by one-third may reflect a
greater or lesser change in GA, in the target cells. For example,
ABA content of leaf epidermal layers increase before ABA
accumulation is evident in whole leaves under water deficits
(31). More information, in addition to that in this paper, will
be needed to clarify the roles of ABA and GA in low
alteration of growth.
