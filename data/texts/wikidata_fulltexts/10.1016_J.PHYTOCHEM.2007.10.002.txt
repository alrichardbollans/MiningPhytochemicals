We report herein, the structureelucidation of the above compounds along with their anti-cholinesterase activities.2. Results and discussionThe methanol extract of powder wood trunk of G. poly-antha was separated by silica gel column chromatographyto give three new xanthone derivatives named polyanx-anthone A (1), B (2) and C (3) along with five known xant-hones: 1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone (4) (Zhang et al., 2002);1,5-dihydroxyxanthone (5) (Nkengfack et al., 2002);1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (6) (Carpenter et al., 1969);1,6-dihydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone (7) (Zhang et al.,2002) and 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (8) (Frahm andChandhuri, 1979).The following spectral data showed that all the newxanthones have a prenyloxy groups at C-1 and C-5. UV1014 G.N. Louh et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 1013–1017absorption of these compounds showed two strong bandsat kmax 240–248 and 254–266 nm, a medium bands at kmax302–312 nm, and weak broad bands at kmax 352–390 nmindicated the conjugated chromophore systems (Ito et al.,2003). The IR spectra showed evenly bands at mmax 1656–1665 and 1560–1601 cm1 (Meli et al., 2005) suggesting acarbonyl and an aromatic double bonds, respectively.Polyanxanthone A (1) was isolated as a whitish crystal,mp: 135–137 C. The HREIMS spectroscopy of this com-pound gave the molecular ion peak at m/z 448.2277 (Calc.448.2212) corresponding to C28H32O5 formula. The1HNMR spectrum showed signals due to three prenyloxygroups, respectively at [dH 4.63(2H, d, J = 6.3 Hz, H-1 0),5.57 (1H, t, J = 6.3 Hz, H-2 0), 1.76 (3H, s, H-5 0), 1.80(3H, s, H-4 0)]; [dH 4.57 (2H, d, J = 6.8 Hz, H-100), 5.52(1H, t, J = 6.8 Hz, H-200), 1.72 (3H, s, H-500), 1.77 (3H, s,H-400)] and [dH 4.70 (2H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, H-1000), 5.62 (1H,t, J = 6.6 Hz, H-2000), 1.75 (3H, s, H-5000), 1.80 (3H, s, H-4000)], as three substituents of xanthone nucleus. Furthermore, an ABX type signals, a lower field signal at dH7.84 (1H, dd, J = 7.8 and 1.4 Hz) was assignable to H-8,which was affected by deshielding due to 9-C@O, andtwo others signals at dH 7.19 (1H, t, J = 7.8) and dH 7.14(1H, dd, J = 7.8 and 1.4 Hz) attributed to H-7 and H-6,respectively. The remaining signals observed as meta-cou-pled aromatic proton at dH 6.60 (1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz) anddH 6.34 (1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz) were assignable to H-2 andH-4, respectively. HMBC correlations (Table 1) from 9-C@O, C-6, C-10a to H-8, from C-8, C-5, C-10a to H-6,from C-5, C-8a to H-7, from C-9a, C-4 to H-2 and fromC-9a, C-2 to H-4 firmly confirm the location of differentaromatic protons. As far as, C–H long range correlationsin the HMBC spectrum (Table 1) from oxygenated quater-nary carbon C-1 to H-1 0, from C-3 to H-100 and from C-5 toH-1000 indicated the assignment of the location of the threeprenyl groups. On the basis of these data, the structure ofpolyanxanthone. A was determined to be (1), identified as1,3,5-triprenyloxyxanthone.Polyanxanthone B (2) was obtained as a white crystal,mp: 139.9–140 C. The molecular formula was determinedas C23H24O5 from the HREIMS, m/z 364.168 (Calc.364.1675). It is 1H NMR spectrum was shown to be quitesimilar to that of (1), with characteristic resonances whichagain could be associated with two prenyloxy moieties,respectively at [dH 4.68 (2H, d, J = 5.7 Hz, H-1 0), 5.57(1H, t, J = 5.7 Hz, H-2 0), 1.80 (3H, s, H-4 0), 1.78 (3H, s,H-5 0)] and [dH 4.70 (2H, d, J = 4.2 Hz, H-100), 5.62 (1H,t, J = 4.2 Hz, H-200), 1.78 (3H, s, H-400), 1.74 (3H, s, H-500)], and three aromatic protons [dH 7.17 (1H, dd, J = 7.8and 1.6 Hz, H-6), 7.21 (1H, t, J = 7.8 Hz, H-7) and 7.85(1H, dd, J = 7.8 and 1.6 Hz, H-8)]. These were observedexcept for the appearance of new aromatic proton ABXsystem on ring C at dH 6.77 (1H, dd, J = 8.4 and 1.2 Hz,H-2), 7.14 (1H, dd, J = 8.4 and 1.2 Hz, H-4) and 7.56(1H, t, J = 8.4 Hz, H-3), and the lack of a typical prenyloxymoiety aforementioned in compound (1). Examination ofthe contour plot of an HMBC experiment (Table 1) thenrevealed that the ring A of (2) was identical to that of poly-anxanthone A and characterized with one prenyloxy groupat C-5. Therefore, polyanxanthone B (2) was identified as1,5-diprenyloxyxanthone.Polyanxanthone C (3) was isolated as yellow oil. Thiscompound was showed to have the molecular formulaC28H32O4 by HREIMS which showed the [M+] ion peakat m/z 432.1683 (Calc. 432.1679). The 1H NMR featureswere similar to those of (2), except for the appearance ofprenyl group at dH 3.45 (2H, d, J = 7.2 Hz), 5.30 (1H, t,J = 7.2 Hz), 1.71 (3H, s) and 1.74 (3 H, s) instead of an aro-matic proton appearing at dH 6.77 in ring C of (2). The lackof ABX system aforenamed on (2) and the presence of twoaromatic protons ortho-coupled firmly indicated that H-2was substituted by a new prenyl moiety. This hypothesiswas confirmed after recording of HMBC and NOESYexperiments showing on one side the expected long rangecorrelation between H-100 of prenyl group and C-1, C-2and C-3 (Table 1) together with the strong nuclear overha-user effects between H-1 0/H-100,and in the other side thestrong nuclear overhauser between H-3/H-4, H-3/H-200and H-1000/H-6 (Fig. 1). These results indicated the structureof polyanxanthone C (3), identified as 1,5-prenyloxy-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)xanthone.2.1. Anticholinesterase activityCompounds 1,2,4,5 and 7 were screened for their cho-linesterase inhibitory potential. The compounds 4,5 and 7showed significant inhibition against BChE with an IC50value of 93.0, 2.54 and 74.4 lM, respectively, while com-pound 2 showed significant inhibition against both AChE(IC50 = 46.3 lM) and BChE (IC50 = 25.5 lM) comparedto the standard, galantamine (IC50 = 0.5 lM and 8.5 lM,respectively). Compound 1 showed 41.8% and 7.0% inhibi-tion against AChE and BChE, respectively, at the concen-tration of 0.2 mM.3. Experimental3.1. General procedureThe melting points were determined on a micro meltingpoint apparatus (Yanaco MP-S3 apparatus) and are uncor-rected. Infrared spectra were obtained on a JASCO A-302spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Ultraviolet spectrawere recorded on a Shimadzu UV 240 spectrophotometerin methanol. Mass spectra (EI and HREIMS) were mea-sured in an electron impact mode on Varian MAT 312spectrometers. The 1H NMR spectra were registered on aBruker Avance AMX 500 NMR spectrometer with tetra-methylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard; while 13CNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance AMX500 NMR spectrometer operating at 125 MHz usingCDCl3 as solvent. Methyl, methylene and methine carbonswere distinguished by DEPT experiments.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade. AChEand BChE inhibiting activities were measured by the spec-trophotometric method developed by Ellman (Ellmanet al., 1961). Acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocho-line chloride were used as substrates to assay AChE andBChE, respectively. The reaction mixture contained130 ll (100 mM) sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 20 llof DTNB, 10 ll of test compound solution and 20 ll ofAChE or BChE solution, which were mixed and incubatedfor 15 min at 25 C. The reaction was then initiated by theaddition of 20 ll acetylthiocholine or butyrythiocholine,respectively. The hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine and buty-rylthiocholine were monitored by the formation of yellow5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion as a result of the reaction ofDTNB with thiocholine, released by the enzymatic hydro-lysis of acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, respec-tively at a wavelength of 412 nm (15 min). Testcompounds and the positive control (galanthamine) weredissolved in EtOH. All the reactions were performed intriplicate in 96-well micro-plates in SpectraMax 340(molecular Devices, USA).
