Abstract: Three new biflavonoids, wikstaiwanones A–C (1–3), along with four known 
compounds  (4–7)  were  isolated  from  the  stems  of  Wikstroemia  taiwanensis 
(Thymelaeaceae). Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 4 
and 5 showed antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC values 
of 15 μg/mL, respectively.

1. Introduction 
Tuberculosis  (TB),  including  multidrug  resistant  tuberculosis  and  extensively  drug  resistant 
tuberculosis, remains an epidemic in many regions of the world, with an estimated 8.8 million new 
cases  and  caused  1.1  million  deaths  globally  in  2010  [1].  In  Taiwan,  it  is  also  one  of  the  most 
important communicable infectious diseases subject to official notification, with the highest number of 
confirmed cases and deaths [2]. Searching new sources of antitubercular agents from nature is crucial 
to curb the rise of drug-resistant strains. Examining an antitubercular activity from crude extracts of 
several  Taiwan  endemic  plants,  we  found  the  methanolic  extract  of  the  stems  of

Wikstroemia taiwanensis showed potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro   
W. taiwanensis  (Thymelaeaceae)  is an  endemic  deciduous  shrub growing in  the south of Taiwan. 
Analysis of the chemical constituents and bioactivity of this plant has not been conducted previously. 
Bioactivity-directed fractionation of the active EtOAc layer of the stems of this species led to the 
isolation  and  characterization  of  three  biflavonoids,  wikstaiwanones  A–C  (1–3),  along  with  three 
known  biflavonoids,  sikokianins  B  (4)  [3],  C  (5)  [4],  isochamaejasmin  (6)  [5],  and,  methyl 
4-hydroxybenzoate (7) [6] (Figure 1). This paper reports the structure elucidation of 1–3 and their 
antitubercular activities.

2. Results and Discussion 
The  present  study  focused  on  the  fraction  of  the  W.  taiwanensis  stem  extract  that  displayed 
biological activity, which was confined to the EtOAc-soluble fraction. When this fraction was further 
separated  by  gel  filtration  into  four  parts,  only  one  of  them  showed  activity  against   Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13  1031 
 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  H37Rv.  On  separating  this  active  part,  compounds  1–7  were  isolated, 
characterization of these compounds indicated 1-3 were new compounds. 
2.1. Structure Elucidation of the New Isolates 
Compound 1 was isolated as an optically active yellowish amorphous powder, [ʱ]
25
D  −77.0 (c 0.03, 
MeOH). Its molecular formula was established as C30H22O10 by ESI-MS and HR-ESI-MS, with 20 
degrees of unsaturation and a dimer composed of a flavone moiety and a flavanol moiety was proposed. 
The observed UV absorption peaks at 210, 217 sh, 226, 315 sh, and 335 sh nm in conjunction with a 
bathochromic  shift  observed  after  the  addition  of  aq.  KOH  suggests  the  presence  of  a  phenolic 
flavonoid moiety [7]. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3450 cm
−1 for a hydroxy group and 
at  1647  cm
−1  for  a  carbonyl  group.  The 
1H-  and 
13C-NMR  spectra  (Table  1)  of  1  showed  a 
trioxygenated flavone moiety [ʴC 160.7 (C-4'), 183.6 (C-4), 163.3 (C-5), and 166.0 (C-7)] with two 
meta-coupled protons [ʴH 6.18 (1H, d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-6), 6.32 (1H, d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-8)] in ring A and 
with a para-oxygenated phenyl group [ʴH 6.67 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-3', 5'), 7.26 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, 
H-2', 6')] in ring C; and another 4''', 3'', 5'', 7''-tetraoxygenated flavan moiety (ʴC 158.1, 68.9, 154.8 and 
156.0) with a para-oxygenated phenyl group [ʴH 6.70 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-3''', 5'''), 7.10 (2H, d,   
J = 9.0 Hz, H-2''', 6''')] in ring C' and an aromatic proton [ʴH 6.04 (1H, s), H-8''] in ring A'. The HMBC 
spectrum (Figure 2) showed correlations between the singlet H-8'' (ʴH 6.04) and C-6'' (ʴC 100.7) and 
the H-3 in ring C was lack in flavone moiety. These supported the connection between the flavone 
moiety and the flavan-3-ol moiety is via C-3 and C-6'' linkage. The molecular formula C30H22O10 
supported  the  presence  of  seven  hydroxy  groups,  which  were  confirmed  by 
13C-NMR,  HMQC, 
NOESY  and  HMBC  (Figure  2)  experiments.  The  relative  configurations  of  H-2''  and  H-3''  were 
determined by NOESY spectrum, where H-2'' showed the correlation with H-3''. Comparing with the 
aglycone  levorotatory  optical  activity  of  epiafzelechin  5-glucoside  [ʱ]
25
D  −63  (MeOH)  [8],  and  the 
absolute configuration of 1 with [ʱ]
25
D  −77.0 (c 0.03, MeOH) was suggested to be (2''R:3''R). It was 
found  that  when  dissolved  in  different  solvents,  other  compounds  with  (2''R:3''R)  structure,  e.g., 
(−)-epicatechin [9] and (−)-epigallocatechin [10] also displayed levorotatory optical activity [9,10]. 
Based  on  the  evidence  above,  the  structure  of  1  was  elucidated  to  be  5,7-dihydroxy-2- 
(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3''R,5'',7''-trihydroxy-2''R-(4'''-hydroxyphenyl)-3'',4''-dihydro-2H-chromen-6''-yl)
-4H-chromen-4-one, and named wikstaiwanone A. 
Compound 2 was obtained as pale yellowish amorphous powder with [ʱ]
25
D  −23.3 (c 0.03, MeOH). 
Its molecular formula, C30H22O10, was same as 1 and established by ESI-MS and HR-ESI-MS. The IR, 
UV, and NMR (Table 1) spectra of 2 were similar to those of 1, except that the different resonance of 
H-2'' (ʴH 4.53 (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz), H-3'' (ʴH 3.68 (1H, br d, J = 8.2 Hz)) in 2 and H-2'' (ʴH 4.13 (1H, d,   
J = 7.8 Hz), H-3'' (ʴH 3.90 (1H, ddd, J = 8.4, 7.8, 6.0 Hz)) in 1. This proposed 2 is a stereoisomer of 1. 
Referring to the coupling constant J = 8.1 Hz of (−)-catechin with [ʱ]
25
D  −14.9 (c 1.0, 50% aqueous 
acetone)  [9],  2  was  suggested  to  be  the  3-epimer  of  1  and  H-2''/H-3''  were  in  trans-orientation.   
Thus  the  absolute  configuration  of  2  was  determined  as  (2''S:3''R).  Based  on  the  above  data,   
compound 2 was determined to be 5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3''R,5'',7''-trihydroxy-2''S- 
(4'''-hydroxyphenyl)-3'',4''-dihydro-2H-chromen-6''-yl)-4H-chromen-4-one,  namely  wikstaiwanone  B, 
which was further confirmed by HMQC, DEPT, NOESY, and HMBC (Figure 2) experiments. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13  1032

Compound 3 was isolated as pale yellowish amorphous powder with [ʱ]
25
D  +53.1 (c 0.058, MeOH). 
Its molecular formula was determined as C31H24O10 by ESI-MS and HR-ESI-MS with 15 unsaturated 
degrees. The 
1H- and 
13C-NMR spectra (Table 2) of 3 were similar to those of chamaejasmine [5] 
except a methoxy signal [ʴH 3.79 (3H, s, OCH3-4'), ʴC 159.6 (C-4')] in 3 was in place of a hydroxy 
group at C-4' in chamaejasmine. Thus the planar structure of 3 was determined as 3-(5,7-dihydroxy- 
2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxochroman-3-yl)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one. 
The  relation  configurations  at  C-2/C-3  and  C-3''/C-2''  positions  were  decided  as  trans-trans  by 
comparison of J values of H-2/H-3 with 12.0 Hz and H-3''/H-2'' with 12.0 Hz, and no correlations 
between H-3/H-2, H-3''/H-2'' were observed. Additionally, H-3 and H-3' (ʴH 2.60 (2H, dd, J = 18.0, 
12.0 Hz)) with  same  chemical shift  supported the H-3 and  H-3' being at same side. Referring to 
chamaejasmine [5] with [ʱ]D −61.2 (c 0.49, MeOH), compound 3 with dextrorotatory optical activity, 
[ʱ]D +53.1 (c 0.058, MeOH), indicated 3 is an enantiomer of chamaejasmine. According to the above 
evidence,  the  structure  of  3  was  elucidated  as  to  be  (2R,3S)-3-((2''R,3''S)-5'',7''-dihydroxy-2''-(4'''- 
hydroxyl-phenyl)-4-oxochroman-3-yl)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one, 
named  wikstaiwanone  C,  which  was  further  confirmed  by  HMQC,  DEPT,  NOESY  and  HMBC   
(Figure 2) techniques. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13  1034

2.2. Antitubercular Activity 
The amount of sample isolated for 1–7 ranged from about 3 to 42 mg, although all compounds 
underwent  structural  characterizations,  only  Shikokianins  B  (4)  and  C  (5)  (42.3  mg  and  35.7  mg 
respectively) provided sufficient quantity for evaluating their in vitro antitubercular activity against   
M. tuberculosis H37Rv with the clinical used drug ethambutol (MIC 6.25 μg/mL) as a positive control. 
Results showed that both 4 and 5 have MIC values of about 15 μg/mL.   Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13  1035 
 
3. Experimental Section 
3.1. General Experimental Procedures 
Optical rotations were measured on a polarimeter (JASCO, Japan), UV spectra were obtained with 
a Jasco V-530 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. IR spectroscopic data were recorded on a Genesis II FTIR 
spectrophotometer  with  KBr  pellets.  NMR  spectra  were  obtained  on  a  Varian  Unity  Plus  400 
spectrometer  (400  MHz  for 
1H-NMR,  100  MHz  for 
13C-NMR)  and  Varian  Unity  Inova  600 
spectrometer (600 MHz for 
1H-NMR, 150 MHz for 
13C-NMR). Chemical shifts were reported with 
respect to acetone-d6, methanol-d4 or DMSO solvents. Low-resolution MS spectra were obtained with 
Micromass Trio-2000 GC/MS, VG Biotech Quattro 5022, and JEOL-JMS-HX 100 mass spectrometers. 
The  HRMS  spectra  were  recorded  on  JEOL  JMS-SX102A  GC/LC/MS  and  Finnigan  MAT-95XL 
high-resolution mass spectrometers. Silica gel (70–230 and 230–400 mesh; Merck) and Spherical C18 
100 Å reversed phase silica gel (RP-18; particle size 20–40 μm; Silicycle) were used for column 
chromatography, and silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) and RP-18 F254S (Merck) were used for TLC and 
preparative  TLC.  Further  purification  was  performed  by  HPLC  (Hitachi;  pump:  L-2130;  UV   
detector: L-2400). 
3.2. Plant Material 
Stems of W. taiwanensis were collected in May, 2008 at Mountain Goshifer, Pingtung County, and 
identified by Professor Ih-Sheng Chen. A voucher specimen (Chen 6163) has been deposited in the 
Herbarium of the College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.   
3.3. Extraction and Isolation 
Dried stems (9.8 kg) of W. taiwanensis were sliced to about 0.5cm in length and extracted three 
times, each time for 8 hours, with cold MeOH at room temperature to yield a MeOH extract, which 
was partitioned between EtOAc:H2O (1:1) to provide an EtOAc-soluble fraction (390 g). Both the 
aqueous  and  the  EtOAc-soluble  fractions  were  studies  for  their  biological  activities.  The  active 
EtOAc-soluble fraction (70 g) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column with CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) to 
obtained 4 fractions (1–4). The bioactive fraction 3 (24 g) was chromatographed on Silica gel CC and 
eluted with a CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O gradient solvent system (50:3:1 to 6:4:1) to give fractions 3a-q. 
Fraction 3b (1.17 g) was subjected to a silica gel CC with CH2Cl2-EtOAc (15:1) to give 10 fractions 
(3b-1 to 3b-10). Fraction 3b-7 was subjected to MPLC and eluted with CH2Cl2-acetone (15:1) to give 
5  (35.7  mg);  Fraction  3b-8  was  applied  to  MPLC  eluting  with  CH2Cl2-MeOH  (20:1)  to  give  6

3.4. Antitubercular Activity Assay   
The  in  vitro  antitubercular  activity  of  each  tested  compound  was  evaluated  using  the 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  H37Rv.  Middlebrook  7H10  agar  was  used  to  determine  the  minimum 
inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  values  as  recommended  by  the  proportion  method  [22].  Briefly,   
each  test  compound  was  added  to  Middlebrook  7H10  agar  supplemented  with  oleic 
acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) at 50–56°  by serial dilution to yield a final concentrations of 
100 to 0.8 μg/mL. Ten milliliter samples of each concentration of test compound-containing medium, 
was dispensed into plastic quadrant Petri dishes. Several colonies of the test isolate of M. tuberculosis 
were selected to make a suspension with Middlebrook 7H10 broth, and used as the initial inoculum. 
The  inoculum  of  test  isolate  of  M.  tuberculosis  was  prepared  by  diluting  the  initial  inoculum  in 
Middlebrook 7H10 broth until turbidity was reduced to that equivalent to that of the McFarland No. 1 
standard.  Final  suspensions  were  prepared  by  adding  Middlebrook  7H10  broth,  and  preparing   
10
−2 dilutions of the standardized bacterial suspensions. After solidification of the Middlebrook 7H10 
medium, 33 μL of the 10
−2 dilution of the standardized bacterial suspensions was placed on each 
quadrant of the agar plates. The agar plates were then incubated at 35°  with 10% CO2 for 2 weeks. The 
MIC is the lowest concentration of test compound that completely inhibited the growth of the test 
isolate of M. tuberculosis, as detected by the unaided eye. 
4. Conclusions 
Three new biflavonoids (1–3) together with four known compounds (4–7) were isolated from the 
stem of W. taiwanensis in this study. Several biflavonoids from Thymelaeaceae have been reported in a 
number of studies [11–18] and their biological activities evaluated [19–21]. Most of them contain 
C-3/C-3''  linkage  with  a  symmetrical  structure  [11–14],  except  for  wikstrols  [4],  genkwanols  and 
stelleranol [14–17]. Compounds 1 and 2 were constituted by a flavone and a flavan-3-ol moieties and 
connected by an unusual C-3/C-6'' linkage, which was found for the first time in nature. The solubility 
in acetone of 1 and 2 is remarkably different, where 1 dissolved in acetone-d6 slightly, 2 was readily 
soluble. Incidentally, their antitubercular properties have not previously been reported. In the study, 
compounds 4 and 5 were evaluated in this respect, and it was revealed that both have MIC values of 
15 μg/mL, which is of the same order as the MIC value for ethambutol, a clinically used drug for Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13  1037 
 
tuberculosis,  i.e.  of  6.25  μg/mL.  This  indicated  that  the  antitubercular  activities  of  isolates  from 
Thymelaeacea may be worth studying further.
