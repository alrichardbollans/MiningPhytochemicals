Background: Therapeutic values of Valeriana officinalis have been associated with sesquiterpenes whose biosynthetic
origins have remained enigmatic.
Results: A cyclobutenyl intermediate in the catalytic cascade of valerena-1,10-diene synthase is reported.
Conclusion: A new class of sesquiterpene synthases for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes harboring isobutenyl functional
groups is proposed.
Significance: Similar catalytic mechanisms from evolutionarily diverse organisms are proposed and portend sources for ses-
quiterpene diversity.
Valerian is an herbal preparation from the roots of Valeriana
officinalis used as an anxiolytic and sedative and in the treat-
ment of insomnia. The biological activities of valerian are attrib-
uted to valerenic acid and its putative biosynthetic precursor
valerenadiene, sesquiterpenes, found in V. officinalis roots.
These sesquiterpenes retain an isobutenyl side chain whose ori-
gin has been long recognized as enigmatic because a chemical
rationalization for their biosynthesis has not been obvious.
Using recently developed metabolomic and transcriptomic
resources, we identified seven V. officinalis terpene synthase
genes (VoTPSs), two that were functionally characterized as
monoterpene synthases and three that preferred farnesyl
diphosphate, the substrate for sesquiterpene synthases. The
reaction products for two of the sesquiterpene synthases exhib-
iting root-specific expression were characterized by a combina-
tion of GC-MS and NMR in comparison to the terpenes accu-
mulating in planta. VoTPS7 encodes for a synthase that
biosynthesizes predominately germacrene C, whereas VoTPS1
catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to valerena-
1,10-diene. Using a yeast expression system, specific labeled
[13C]acetate, and NMR, we investigated the catalytic mecha-
nism for VoTPS1 and provide evidence for the involvement of a
caryophyllenyl carbocation, a cyclobutyl intermediate, in the
biosynthesis of valerena-1,10-diene.We suggest a similarmech-
anism for the biosynthesis of several other biologically related
isobutenyl-containing sesquiterpenes.
Valerian is a nutraceutical preparation from the roots ofVal-
eriana officinalis and related species that is recommended for
relief of tension, anxiety, and insomnia (1–3). V. officinalis
grows as a wild herb in very diverse habitats around the globe,
and valerian has been used for hundreds of years as a herbal
remedy (4, 5). For example, it was used as a treatment to relieve
the stress of air raids in England duringWWII (6). The greatest
biological efficacy of valerian has been correlated with freshly
harvested and carefully dried root preparations and with the
iridoid alkaloid and sesquiterpene content of these prepara-
tions (7). The valepotriates are epoxyiridoid esters with the
dominant species being valtrate (8). Because of putative insta-
bility and water insolubility of the valepotriates, some investi-
gations have suggested that the sesquiterpene compounds are
more important for the sedative activity of valerian (8). The
sesquiterpene derivatives valerenic acid and valeranone have
both been shown to possess potent biological activities (9).
Valerenic acid is thought to be derived from valerena-1,10-
diene, whereas valeranonemight be derived from a germacrene
precursor (Fig. 1). However, valerenadiene has been of particu-
lar interest to others studying related biologically active ses-
quiterpene compounds like tamariscol (10), tamariscene (11),
and pacifigorgiol (12) (Fig. 1) because the biogenic origin of the

isobutenyl substituent group common to these molecules has
remained enigmatic. To investigate possible mechanisms for
the biosynthesis of the unique valerenadiene scaffold (11), we
have leveraged our recent assembly of transcriptomic (see
Medicinal Plant Genomics Resource Internet website) and
metabolomic (see Medicinal Plant Metabolomic Resource
Internet website) resources for 14 different medicinal plant
species including V. officinalis. Using these resources, we iden-
tified seven possible terpene synthase gene candidates, exam-
ined their tissue-specific expression profiles, and correlated
these with the accumulation of sesquiterpenes, then function-
ally characterized the terpene synthase enzymes encoded by
these genes in vitro and in vivo. During the course of this work,
Pyle et al. (13) also reported a similar effort to identify sesquit-
erpene synthases from V. officinalis and described the charac-
terization of a valerena-1,10-diene synthase. However, in the
current work we have exploited the valerenadiene synthase
to probe and validate an unusual catalytic cascade for the
generation of isobutenyl constellations on a unique class of
biologically active sesquiterpenes.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plant Material—Authenticated V. officinalis L. (Valeri-
anaceae) seeds were purchased from Richters Herbs (Ontario,
Canada). The seeds were germinated in germination trays with
Promix potting mixture in an environmentally controlled
greenhouse at the University of Mississippi Medicinal Plant
Garden. The average temperature and humidity in the green-
house were maintained at 70 °F and 60%, respectively, and nat-
ural light and fluorescent grow lights were used to maintain a
minimumof 16 h of light per 24-h period. Two-week-old plant-
letswere transferred into larger potswith Promixpottingmix-
ture. Theywere hand-watered and fertilized twice amonthwith
Miracle Grow all-purpose plant food. Three separate popula-
tions were maintained from three different seed accessions.
The tissue harvesting was done from 1-year-old plants selected
randomly. Young leaves (25% expanded), mature leaves (fully
expanded), petioles, and lateral roots were harvested for both
reference and experiment samples with three replicates, frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at
80 °C. The weight and photographic record of all samples
were obtained.
Young leaves (5.0–15.0 mm) of Valeriana officinalis were
used as explants for callus culture induction. Explants were sur-
face-sterilized with 0.5% NaOCl (15% v/v bleach) and 0.1%
Tween 20 for 20 min then washed extensively with sterile dis-
tilled water before inoculation onto Murashige and Skoog
medium containing 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) Type E agar
(Sigma) supplemented with 4.0 mg/liter napthalene acetic acid
(NAA) in combination with 0.2 mg/liter thidiazuron for callus
induction. The medium was adjusted to pH 5.7. The cultures

ison to related hydrindane-type sesquiterpenes found in association with liverworts (Frullania tamarisci) and gorgonian sponges (Pacifigoria cf.
adamsii). A, multistep pathways are depicted, the first step catalyzed by a sesquiterpene synthase (TPS) cyclizing FPP to either germacrene C (1) or valerena-
1,10-diene (2) followed by internal ring formation and hydroxylation/reduction (valeranone) or successive hydroxylation/oxidation at one of the terminal
methyls of the isobutenyl side chain (valerenic acid). B, tamariscene (5), tamarisol (6), and pacifigorgiol (7) appear to share a valerenadiene-like scaffold in
common with valerenic acid and hence may share a similar biosynthetic origin as suggested by Paul et al. (11).

were incubated at 25  2 °C with a 16-h photoperiod under
fluorescent light with 52  5 mol m2 s1 photon flux den-
sity. Thirty 5-day-old calli were collected formetabolomics and
RNAseq analysis.
Metabolomics—One gram of freeze-dried tissue sample pul-
verized in liquid N2 was extracted for 3 h by shaking in 10 ml of
chloroform:methanol (1:1 v/v) containing external standard
propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (10 M) and antioxidant butylated
hydroxytoluene (1 mg/ml). The mixture was filtered through
pre-weighedWhatman filter paper, and the filtratewas used for
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) analysis. Filter
paper containing plant residue was air-dried for 24 h, oven-
dried at 40 °C for an additional 24 h, thenweighed to determine
dry weight of the plant tissue extracted.
Aliquots of the extracts were then analyzed using a nontar-
geted metabolomic approach based on ultrahigh performance
liquid chromatography/TOFMS), electrospray ionization, and
nonselective multiplexed collision-induced dissociation (14)
that generates global accurate molecular and fragment mass
information. Automated peak detection, alignment, and inte-
gration were performed using Waters MarkerLynx software,
and peak areas were exported to a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet (for qualitative and quantitative assessments). Metab-
olite identities were confirmed by comparison of retention
times and molecular and fragment masses to available
authentic standards.
The spreadsheet data were incorporated into an extendable
database linked to a search and display software interface, pub-
lically available atMedicinal PlantMetabolomic Resource. This
interface enables metabolite searches by species, molecular
mass ranges, and/or key terms. Analysis includes scatterplots
for assessing replicability, means and standard errors of
selected compound across multiple samples, and comparison
of differences in metabolite levels across two samples with p
values calculated according to the number of replicates via vol-
cano plots and ratio plots.
Chemical Profiling of the Plant Tissues—The metabolite
extracts were prepared from 300mg of each tissue sample pow-
dered in liquid nitrogen, then extracted with 5 ml of n-hexanes
with shaking at room temperature for 2 h. The filtrate was then
passed through a 0.25  2-cm silica column, concentrated to
100 l under nitrogen gas, and then analyzed by GC-MS.
Transcriptome—RNAwas isolated from callus, young leaves,
mature leaves, lateral roots, and stem/petioles from three
V. officinalis populations as described previously (15). cDNA
libraries were constructed using the mRNA-Seq kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) and sequenced to 35 bp in the single end mode
or 76 bp in the paired end mode on the Illumina Genome Ana-
lyzer IIx platform at the Michigan State University Research
Technology Support Facility. Reads were cleaned and assem-
bled as described previously (15). Transcript assemblies were
annotated for function using a combination of BLAST (16)
sequence similarity results to UniRef100 (17) and Pfam (18)
domain composition in ESTScan-predicted (19) peptide
sequences. Custom perl scripts were used to remove low com-
plexity sequences and potential contaminants in the transcrip-
tome assembly based on sequence similarity to UniRef100
entries in the bacterial, fungal, virus, and viroid kingdoms as
well as Arthropoda, Stramenopiles and human sequences.
Expression abundances were estimated by mapping single end
reads from each library to the reference transcriptome using
TopHat (20) and Cufflinks (21) as described previously (15).
Raw sequences are available in the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive under accession number SRP005998. Assembled tran-
scripts are available at Medicinal Plant Genomics Resource.
A total of 223,381,692 readswere generated fromall libraries,
and 138,222,300 (61.8%) were incorporated into the final de
novo assembly. After removal of contaminants and low com-
plexity sequences (1594), the assembly contained a total of
75,326 transcripts with an N50 (the contig size such that all
contigs larger than that have 50% the bases of the assembly) of
1060 bp. Single and multiple isoform transcripts were present
within the assembly, and a set of 35,556 unique transcripts (uni-
genes) was used for expression abundance estimations using
TopHat (20) and Cufflinks (21).
DNA sequences described here are deposited in GenBankTM
with the following accession numbers: VoTPS1,2 JX494699;
VoTPS2, JX494700; VoTPS3, JX494701; VoTPS4, JX494702;
VoTPS5, JX494703; VoTPS6, JX494704; VoTPS7, JX494705.
RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Valeriana tissues
using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA
was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) under conditions recom-
mended by the manufacturer and used as a template for RT-
PCR. To perform the PCR, the 50-l reaction mixture con-
tained 1.0l of the first-strand cDNA, 200M dNTPs, 1 unit of
Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), and 10 pmol of each specific
primer sets. Primer pairs are given in supplemental Table S1.
Forward and reverse primers included restriction sites for Bam-
HII and NotI, respectively. These restriction sites were subse-
quently used to introduce the amplicons into the pET 28a
expression vector (Novagen). The PCR protocol used was an
initial denaturation at 98 °C for 3 min, then a cycling regime of
20–30 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1min.
After completion of the PCR, aliquots of the reactions were
examined by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Bacterial Expression/Enzyme Assays—The various RT-PCR
amplification productswere ligated into the pET28a vector and
transformed to Escherichia coli BL21 (DE). Cultures initiated
from single colonies were cultured at 37 °C until an optical den-
sity of 0.7, then 0.5mM isopropyl 1-thio--D-galactopyranoside
was added, and the cultures were incubated for an additional
10 h at room temperature with shaking. Cells were then col-
lected by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10min, resuspended in
lysis buffer of 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 1% glycerol (v/v), and
sonicated 5 times for 20 s, and the cleared supernatants
(16,000 g for 10min at 4 °C)were stored at80 °C before use.
Enzyme assays were initiated by mixing aliquots of the
cleared supernatants with 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM

(20 Ci mmol1, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) or 30 M
farnesyl diphosphate (0.5 Ci of [1-3H]FPP ( 20 Ci mmol1,
American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in a total reaction volume
of 50 l. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15
min and extracted with 150 l of hexanes, unreacted prenyl
diphosphates and prenyl alcohols were removed with silica gel,
and incorporation of radioactivity was measured by scintilla-
tion counting.
For GC-MS profiling of the enzyme reaction products, 50 l
of cleared supernatant (0.8–1.0 g protein/l) was incubated
in 250mMTris-HCl, pH7.0, 50mMMgCl2with 10g of FPP for
2 h at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was then
extracted twice with an equal volume of hexanes, concentrated
10-fold under nitrogen gas, and analyzed by GC-MS. GC con-
ditions consisted of a Varian CP-3800 GC couple to a Varian
Saturn 2200MS/MS using a Supelco SLB-5ms fused silica cap-
illary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m film thickness).
Initial oven temperature was set at 70 °C for 1 min followed by
an 8 °C/min gradient to 200 °C, then 20 °C/min to 300 °C.
For enzyme kinetic studies, bacterial expressed enzymes
were purified by their carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tags
using His-Select Cobalt affinity gel (Sigma) columns following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. The purified protein
fractions were concentrated usingAmiconUltra centrifugation
filter units and stored in 300mMNaCl, 20mMTris-HCl, pH 7.5,
5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mMMgCl2, 50% glycerol (v/v) at80 °C.
Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
NMR Studies—For yeast expression vector construction, the
VoTPS1 and VoTPS7 genes were inserted into a pESC plasmid
(Agilent Technologies) behind the constitutive GPD promoter.
Yeast strain ZX178–08 was used for all the expression studies
reported here. This strain was selected for its ability to meet its
sterol needs by taking up exogenous sterols under aerobic con-
ditions and further engineered to have a dispensable meval-
onate biosynthetic pathway that can be redirected to sesquiter-
pene biosynthesis.3 40-ml seed train cultures of yeast harboring
pESC-VoTPS1 or pESC-VoTPS7 were grown in SCE liquid
medium (22) lacking leucine for 4 days then inoculated at 3%
v/v of the seed train cultures into multiple 1-liter cultures and
grown at 28 °C. When sesquiterpene production became satu-
rated, approximately after 6 days, the fermentation broth was
first incubated with an equal volume of acetone with shaking
for 12 h at 28 °C then extracted with an equal volume of
hexanes, and the hexanes extract were dried under nitrogen to
a volume of200 ml. The extract was then passed over a silica
gel G60 column (20  160 mm), and the flow-through was
collected. The flow-through of VoTPS1 afforded 6 mg of puri-
fied 2, whereas VoTPS7 required additional purification via an
HPLC separation system (Develosil Packed Column, 20 250
mm, Nomura Chemical Co., Ltd.). Preparative scale separation
of sesquiterpenes was conducted on a Waters Alliance 2695
system with an attached photodiode array in an isocratic mix-
ture of 1:4000 methyl tert-butyl ether:hexanes.
For the isolation of sesquiterpenes from plant material,
V. officinalis roots (78.85 g) were frozen and powdered in liquid
nitrogen. The powdered material was distributed among eight
50-ml centrifuge tubes, and each sample wasmixed thoroughly
with 30 ml of n-hexane. The samples were then sonicated at
room temperature for 30 min followed by centrifugation at
4000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected and
combined. The sonication extraction was repeated, and the
combined supernatant was concentrated to 1ml by a combina-
tion of rotoevaporation at 35 °C and drying under nitrogen gas.
The sesquiterpenes were separated by silica chromatography
(200–300 mesh, 21- 1.5-cm inner diameter) using n-hexane
as the solvent. Fractions of 3–4mlwere collected and evaluated
by TLC and GC-MS. Compound 2, valerena-1,10-diene, was
characterized from fractions 9–11, whereas compound 1, ger-
macrene C, from fractions 21–23 was used for identification.
NMR spectra were measured either on a Bruker 500MHz or
Varian Vnmr 500 (1H, 500 MHz; 13C, 125MHz) spectrometer
using hexane-d14 and CDCl3 as solvent.
Labeling Studies—To prepare 13C-labeled valerena-1,10-
diene, six cultures of 0.5 liters of SCE-Leu liquid media were
inoculated with seed train cultures as before and grown for 4
days. On the fourth day, 3.0 g of [1-13C]sodium acetate (Sigma)
was added, and incubation was continued for an additional
48 h. The cultures were then harvested and extracted with ace-
tone and hexane, and the hexane phase was fractionated over
silica gel to isolate 6.5 mg of labeled 2. The labeled sample and
6.5 mg of unlabeled 2 were analyzed by 13C NMR under iden-
tical experimental conditions (standard s2pul pulse sequence
with 340 scans and the delay and pulse width set to the manu-
facturer’s default values). Enrichment values were determined
by comparing the ratios of the peak heights between the two
samples, then multiplying by 1.1% to give the percent enrich-
ment relative to that occurring from the natural abundance of
13C (23, 24). For C-10 and C-11, which demonstrated Jc-c cou-
pling in the labeled sample, the peak intensity at c 126.391 ppm
and c 129.986 (for C-10 and C-11, respectively) were com-
pared with the identical peak intensities corresponding to C-10
and C-11 in the unlabeled sample (see supplemental Fig. S8).
RESULTS
Computational andMolecular Screens for Terpene Synthases—
To identify metabolic intermediates and the genes/enzymes
that are required for their synthesis, it is useful to evaluate the
site(s) of synthesis, which may be distinct from the site of accu-
mulation.When considering the location of sesquiterpene bio-
synthesis versus accumulation of V. officinalis, we first sought
to determine if the valerenadiene scaffold might accumulate in
root tissue, thus suggesting that its site of synthesis might also
be in this tissue. To do this, we searched the Medicinal Plant
Metabolomics Resource, which contains metabolomics data
and metadata, analysis, and visualization for 14 medicinal spe-
cies including V. officinalis. The site provides a variety of link-
ages and methods for statistical analysis, visualization, and
comparison amongmetabolite data, chemical information, and
metadata. When the LC-TOF MS profile for eight different
tissue types of V. officinalis, including leaves, flowers, develop-
ing and mature leaves, roots and callus cultures were screened3 X. Zhuang and J. Chappell, unpublished data

for metabolites that yielded ions in the narrow range of m/z
203.1 to 203.2 (corresponding to a fragment ion of elemental
formula C15H23, derived from a downstream oxidized
metabolite of valerenadiene), several metabolites meeting this
criterion were found exclusively in the root samples, including
one corresponding to an acetylated sesquiterpenoid diol that
yielded multiple fragment ions supportive of this annotation
(supplemental Fig. S1).
This was suggestive that the terpene synthase(s) responsible
for the biosynthesis of the valerenadiene scaffold could in fact
be localized to the root tissue. To evaluate this possibility, we
next queried the V. officinalis de novo assembly transcriptome
for type I sesquiterpene synthases using the well characterized
premnaspirodiene synthase from Hyoscyamus muticus (HPS)
(25) as the search query. Seven distinct contigs with sequence
identity and similarity to HPS in excess of 29 and 46%, respec-
tively, and appearing to represent full-length mRNAs encoding
for proteins with greater than 490 amino acids were recovered
(supplemental Fig. S2). These sequences were designated as
VoTPS1 through -7. When the conceptual translations of each
were aligned together with the HPS protein, several regions
diagnostic for class I or clade “a” terpene synthases, TPS-a, like
the DDXXD domain associated with the binding of a divalent
cation co-factor (26, 27), were readily apparent (supplemental
Fig. S2). In addition, VoTPS3 contained an extended amino-
terminal sequence suggestive that this synthase might be tar-
geted to the chloroplast compartment, consistent with a pre-
diction score of 0.581 for the amino-terminal 88 amino acids
serving as a chloroplast signal sequence peptide by the ChloroP
1.1 algorithm. Also important to note, due to the algorithm
used in assembling the DNA sequence reads into contigs
from RNA samples pooled from several reference plant tis-
sue types, a second TPS, VoTPS4, nearly identical to VoTPS3
was identified. VoTPS4 is predicted to initiate translation at
a second methionine 46 codons 3 to the initiating methio-
nine predicted for VoTPS3. Given the absolute sequence
identity of these genes, we suspect these TPSs to be one and
the same and henceforth designate the combined contig as
VoTPS3/4.
If valerenadiene biosynthesis occurs in the roots of V. offici-
nalis, then one would expect the mRNA encoding for the puta-
tive valerenadiene synthase to be represented, perhaps exclu-
sively, in root tissue. The VoTPSs mRNA levels were thus
examined in two ways. First, because of the quantitative nature
of the RNA-seq methodology used to generate the tissue-spe-
cific transcriptomes, the relative abundance of each VoTPS
transcripts can be quantified in each of the tissue types as the
number of sequenced fragments mapping to a contig per kilo-
base of sequence per million reads (FRPM) (21) (Fig. 2).
VoTPS3, its likely truncated form VoTPS4, and VoTPS6 all
appear to be constitutively expressed across the various tissue
types with VoTPS 3 expression being 10–20-fold greater than
VoTPS6. In contrast, VoTPS1, -2, -5, and -7 exhibited expres-
sion patterns more specific to root tissue with the expression
levels of VoTPS2 and -5 being3–10-fold lower, respectively,
than for VoTPS1 and -7.
The quantitative RNA-seq transcript compilation was also
validated by a more traditional quantitative RT-PCR assay as

within the linear amplification range for each amplicon. PCR reactions with primers specific for actin mRNA were performed to judge the qualitative and
quantitative quality of the RNA templates used.

well (Fig. 2). In these analyses, RNAwas isolated for the various
tissue types, converted to first strand cDNA, and then used as a
template with specific PCR primer pairs for each VoTPS tran-
script under PCR conditions determined to be within a linear
amplification range for all the amplicons (i.e. 20–26 cycles).
Although the levels of VPS1–4 transcripts were consistent with
the quantitative RNA-seq comparisons, transcript amounts for
VoTPS5 and -7 were much more evident in stem and mature
leaf tissue and directly comparable with those observed in
roots.
Functional Characterization of VoTPS1 and VoTPS7—Al-
though sequence alignments are generally sufficient to classify
theVoTPS genes as terpene synthases, direct biochemical char-
acterization is necessary to determine if these genes code for
monoterpene or sesquiterpene synthases and certainly to
ascribe a particular biochemical reaction to these enzymes.
Thus, we first prepared cell-free extracts fromE. coli expressing
each of the VoTPS cDNAs and used these extracts for monot-
erpene and sesquiterpene synthase enzyme assays. In these
assays the E. coli extracts were incubated with radiolabeled
allylic diphosphate substrates, [1-3H]GPP or [1-3H]FPP, and
the conversion of these substrates to hexane extractable prod-
ucts was determined (Fig. 3). The activities of these putative
terpene synthases were examined relative to a negative (an
extract prepared from E. coli harboring the expression plasmid
without an insertedTPS gene) andpositive (an extract prepared
from E. coli expressing the previously characterized sesquiter-
penes synthase gene encoding for HPS (25)) control. As evident
in Fig. 3, very littlemonoterpene synthase activity was recorded
for the negative control, but the HPS-positive control did yield
somemonoterpene product. This has been observed previously
and attributed to the sesquiterpene synthases having larger
activity site pockets that can accommodate smaller substrates.
VoTPS1, -5, and -7 appear to have similar low level activities
withGPP, whereas VoTPS3 and -4were clearly capable of turn-
ing over significant amounts ofGPP to hydrophobic extractable
products. This information suggested that VoTPS3 and -4,
although different by only 32 amino acids at the amino termi-
nus of VoTPS3, might in fact be monoterpene synthases. In
contrast, relative to the HPS positive control, VoTPS 1, 5, and 7
all exhibited very substantial sesquiterpene synthase activities
with typical kinetic properties (supplemental Fig. S3).
When the reaction products of these in vitro assays were
profiled by GC-MS, three distinct compounds were observed
for theVoTPS1 reaction, andonemajor compoundwith several
possible minor, closely migrating compounds was observed for
the VoTPS7-mediated reaction (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig.
S4). The reaction products of both these enzymes were also
found in commonwith constituents found in extracts prepared
from roots (Fig. 4D) but not from leaves or stems (Fig. 4, A–C).
Although the mass spectra for each of the TPS reaction com-
pounds exhibited signature ion patterns consistent with ses-
quiterpenes (supplemental Fig. S4), theseMS patterns were not
sufficient to determine the absolute compound identities.
Hence, we overexpressed the VoTPS1 and -7 genes in a yeast
line developed for high level accumulation of FPP and sesquit-
erpene biosynthesis to obtain sufficient amounts of the respec-
tive compounds for NMR analysis (supplemental Fig. S5).

Structural Elucidation of Sesquiterpene Products from
VoTPS1 and VoTPS7—Six-liter fermentations of recombinant
yeast overexpressing the respective TPS genes were lysed in
acetone, and then the hydrocarbon fractionwas extracted three
timeswith hexanes to isolate terpene components. The extracts
were fractionated via silica gel chromatography to afford 20mg
of the sesquiterpene products produced by VoTPS7. Four ses-
quiterpenes were identified in the mixture based on GC-MS
analyses, whereas the dominant peak constituted 90% of the
total mixture, the second peak was 7%, and the third and fourth
compoundswere less than 3%. The twomajor compoundswere
further purified via HPLC to afford 12 and 1 mg, respectively.
The identity of the VoTPS7 products as germacrenes was
supported by their degradation to elemenes via a characteristic
Cope rearrangement in the GC-MS at high temperatures (28,
29). One of theminor compoundswas identified as germacrene
A based on identical retention time and mass spectral charac-
teristics to a germacrene A standard provided by Robert M.
Coates (University of Illinois) (30). Compound 1 isolated from
root material was identified as germacrene C based on a com-
bination of 1H,13C, 1H,1H gCOSY, 13C,1H HSQC, and 13C,1H
HMBC spectral analyses (Fig. 5, Table 1). 1H NMR analyses
revealed three olefinic protons, (H 4.96, 5.26, 6.28), two singlet
olefinic methyl groups (H 1.20 and 1.61), and two geminal
couplingmethyl groups (H 1.12 and 1.14). 1H,1H gCOSY anal-
ysis revealed four spin systems stretching fromH-1 to H-2, H-4
to H-6, H-8 to H-9, H-11 to CH3-12 and CH3-13. 13C and
13C,1H HMBC correlations established the E-configuration of
double bonds between C-2 and C-3 and between C-1 and C-10
(Fig. 5). Altogether, compound 1 isolate from plant tissue was
identified as germacrene C, whichwas identical to compound 1
produced by yeast overexpressing the VoTPS7 gene based on
GC retention time and the MS fragmentation pattern (supple-
mental Fig. S4). Minor amounts of germacrene A and lesser
amounts of two other putative germacrenes, B and D, are also
based on GC-MS assessments (30).
Compound 2was produced by overexpression of VoTPS1 in
a 6-liter yeast fermentation then extracted with acetone and
hexane. Silica gel fractionation of the hexane extract afforded 6
mg of pure compound 2. Compound 2 was subjected to one-
and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic analyses, including
1H,1H gCOSY, 13C,1HHSQC, and 13C,1HHMBC analyses (Fig.
5, Table 1). A single olefinic proton (H 5.46, d, J  9 Hz) and
three olefinic methyl singlets were evident from the 1H-NMR
spectrum (H 1.62, 1.66, 1.68). An additional aliphatic methyl
group was found at H 0.75 (H 0.75, d, J  7). The 1H,1H
gCOSY revealed two spin systems, one stretching fromH-15 to
H-10 and another from H-6-to H-8. This indicated the possi-
bility of a bicyclic terpenoid skeleton. The 13C NMR revealed
three quarternary olefinic (C 128.6, 129.9, 136.2) and one
methine olefinic carbon (C 126.4).
The 13C,1HHMBCspectrum illuminated the unusual carbon
skeleton of compound 2. Correlations between the methyl
groups at C-12 and C-13 and the H-10 olefinic proton revealed
an unusual isobutenyl constellation attached at C-2. The posi-
tion of the other olefinic methyl at 9-C could be established by
a weak HMBC correlations between H-2 and C-9 and between
the H-14 methyl protons and C-1 and C-9. Correlations
between the H-15methyl protons and C-4, C-5, and C-6 estab-
lished the connectivity of themethyl group at C-5 (Fig. 5). Alto-
gether, the one- and two-dimensional NMRdata elucidated the
structure of 2 as being valerena-1,10-diene. This assignment
was further verified by comparison to published spectral data of
valerena-1,10-diene fromPaul et al. (11). Additionally, the one-
and two-dimensionalNMRdata obtained for compound 2 (val-
erena-1,10-diene) isolated from V. officinalis root tissue, the
VoTPS1 yeast-produced compound, and that prepared syn-
thetically by Kitayama et al. (31) were identical, as were the GC

Elucidating a Catalytic Mechanism for Valerenadiene
Synthase—The biogenic origin of valerenadiene and other
related sesquiterpenes has remained enigmatic due to the con-
ceptual difficulties in chemically rationalizing the generation of
an isobutenyl side chain at C-2 of 2. The isobutenyl side chain
could be hypothesized to simply stem from the unreacted “tail”
end of FPP, but this view is complicated by the formation of the
atypical 5,6-bicyclic ring system. Connolly et al. (10) addressed
this mechanistic uncertainty in part by suggesting the possible
involvement of a caryophyllene intermediate, and Paul et al.
(11) proposed the possible involvement of a cyclopropyl inter-
mediate. We have expanded on these possibilities by envision-
ing the formation of the isobutenyl side chain as arising from a
ring opening of a caryophyllenyl carbocation intermediate fol-
lowed by internal ring formation and migration of the isobute-
nyl substituent via either 1) a 1,2 isobutenyl migration or 2)
through a cyclopropyl intermediate (Fig. 6).
To test this model, we have taken advantage of the yeast
heterologous expression system, noting that [1-13C]acetate
would be preferentially incorporated into six positions of FPP
as a result of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway operating in
yeast. It is well characterized that [1-13C]acetate can feed into
the mevalonate pathway and become incorporated at positions
1 and 3 of the intermediate isopentenyl diphosphate (32). By
following this biosynthetic logic, we envisage that feeding
[1-13C]acetate to VoTPS1-expressing yeast would result in the
predicted incorporation of 13C into the FPP substrate and the
subsequent labeling of 2 at carbons 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 (Fig. 6).
A 3-liter fermentation of yeast overexpressing VoTPS1 was
grown in six 2-liter shake flasks to rapid growth phase before
500 mg of [1-13C]acetate was added to each flask. The yeast
were grown for an additional 48 h, and the labeled valerena-
1,10-diene hydrocarbon was purified from the culture. 6.5 mg
of labeled 2 was isolated, and the measurement of its 13C NMR
spectrumwas compared with 6.5 mg of unlabeled 2 run under an
identical set of spectroscopic conditions. Because control yeast
(yeast that donot harbor any of theVoTPSgenes) donot accumu-
late any sesquiterpenes (supplemental Fig. S5), parallel labeling
and purification efforts with control yeast were not performed.
The 13C-labeled sample demonstrated enrichments of 3.2 to
8.0% for six carbons at positions C-3, C-5, C-7, C-9, C-10, and
C-11 without any enrichment at other carbons as compared

with the unlabeled control (Table 2). Most notably, the C-10-
and C-11-labeled carbons evinced an additional J 35 Hz cou-
pling due to the 13C enrichment (supplemental Fig. S8). This
suggests that the C-2 isobutenyl moiety of 2 does not arise
“intact” from FPP but rather from some sort of caryophyllene
rearrangement as proposed. This observation agrees with the
predicted enrichment patterns envisaged in the hypothetical
pathway.
The apparent differential enrichment of 2.5-fold is not
uncommon in such labeling experiments (33), and the same
enrichment pattern (C-3, -5, and -7 showing greater enrich-
ment than C-9, -10, and -11) was observed in an independent,
replicated experiment. Although it is difficult to envision a bio-
chemical mechanism to account for the differential incorpora-
tion of 13C at these positions from 1-13C acetate, a possible
explanation relates to the physical environment of these labeled
carbons themselves. C-3, -5, and -7 are hybridized to neighboring
atoms via sp3 orbitals, whereas C-9, -10, and -11 are associated
with sp2 orbitals. It is also not difficult to envision that the relax-
ation rates of these carbons in the different bond configurations
could also be affected, and hence the relative intensity of their
NMR signals could be dampened or enhanced accordingly.
DISCUSSION
Although the work presented here was initiated in large part
to unravel the catalytic mechanism for valerenadiene, progress
was greatly facilitated by the availability of transcriptomic and
metabolomics datasets from the Medicinal Plant Consortium
efforts (Medicinal Plant Metabolomic Resource, Medicinal
Plant Genomics Resource). These resources allowed us to
determine that at least one sesquiterpene hydrocarbon accu-
mulated exclusively in root tissue, thus implicating roots as a
primary site for sesquiterpene biosynthesis, a notion consistent
with previous reports of diverse sesquiterpenoids found in
association with roots of Valeriana and related plant species
(11, 34, 35). Independent analysis of the hydrocarbon profile of
leaves, stems, and roots (Fig. 4) confirmed and extended these
observations. Three major sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons,
including germacrene C and valerenadiene, and at least five
minor sesquiterpene hydrocarbons accumulate specifically in
root tissue. Screening of the V. officinalis transcriptome,
assembled by combining the RNA-seq data generated from
individual tissue types, revealed seven terpene synthase-like
contigs that were all confirmed by independent RT-PCR exper-
imentation. The contig pair VoTPS3/4 appears to represent a
single gene highly expressed in all tissue types examined that
encodes for a monoterpene synthase-like enzyme targeted to
the chloroplast compartment. A second gene, VoTPS6, also
exhibited a more constitutive expression profile based on the
detection of sequence reads within the individual tissue-spe-
cific transcriptomes, albeit 10–20-fold lower than that for
TPS3/4. Unfortunately, we were unable to functionally charac-
terize the VoTPS6 enzyme because the heterologous expres-
sion conditions have yet to yield catalytically competent protein
capable of utilizing GPP or FPP as a substrate. In contrast,
VoTPS5 mRNA is present in all tissue types examined except
young leaf and appears to encode for a sesquiterpene synthase
activity based on a 5-fold greater activity with saturating
amounts of FPP rather than GPP as substrate.
VoTPS1, -2, and -7 were of particular interest because the
expression profiles of these mRNAs were 18–40-fold more
specific to root tissue, the putative site of valerenadiene and
valerenic acid biosynthesis, than to any other tissue. We have
not been able to functional characterize the VoTPS2 enzyme
activity because of insufficient expression of the corresponding
cDNA in bacteria or yeast. In contrast, VoTPS7 was function-
ally characterized as a germacrene C synthase, which may be
important for the biosynthesis and accumulation of valeranone
(Fig. 1). Confirmation of such a suggestion, however, must
await additional efforts tomeasure valeranone levels in roots of
plants overexpressing or suppressing VoTPS7 gene expression.
Most importantly, we identified VoTPS1 as encoding for a
functional valerana-1,10-diene synthase, as has Pyle et al. (13),
which provided us with a means for probing the mechanistic
features of this enigmatic reaction. The conversion of FPP to
valerianadiene was recognized much earlier by Connolly et al.
(10) and Paul et al. (11) as not likely occurring by mechanisms
typically employed in the biosynthesis of many of the other
classes of sesquiterpenes.More specifically, there is not an obvi-
ous mechanism for how the FPP molecule might be cyclized to
yield the isobutenyl side chain. The precedence for bond for-
mation between C10 or C11 (see FPP (4) numbering system,
Fig. 6), which share a double bond, and the carbocation gener-
ated at C1 upon ionization of the diphosphate substituent
group is well established (36). However, formation of a bond
between the carbocation at C1 and C9 to yield an isobutenyl
side chain has not been observed and is difficult, if not impos-
sible, to envision chemically because C9 does not have a Pi
orbital nor an electron available for formation of a new carbon-
carbon bond. As an alternative, Pyle et al. (13) suggested that
valerenadienemight arise from amacrocyclic germacene inter-
mediate via a ring contraction mechanism. In this mechanism
the initial germacrenyl ring arises when a bond between C10
and the carbocation at C1 forms, shifting the carbocation to the
tertiary carbon of the isopropyl side chain. A 1,3 hydride shift to

ric conditions. The ratio of labeled peak height to unlabeled peak height at each C

abundance of 13C at that position according to Hirai et al. (23) and Takahashi and
Tomita (24).

reposition the carbocation to C1 could then allow for a meth-
ylenemigration of the bond between C9 and C10 to yield a new
C9-C1 bond and formation of the isobutenyl side chain
appended fromC1. Besides considerable physical and energetic
difficulties (i.e. hydride shift from the tertiary to secondary car-
bon), this mechanism is unlikely based on the [13C]acetate
labeling experiments presented here. If the macrocyclic rear-
rangement occurred as proposed by Pyle et al. (13), C1 in the
six-membered ring and the carbon bound to themethyl groups
of the isobutenyl side chain should be enriched for 13C.
Although the carbon bound to the methyl substituents was
labeled, no label was incorporated into what would be C1
according the germacrene rearrangement model. Instead, the
first and second carbons of the isobutenyl side chain were
equally enriched with the 13C label. Based on the suggestion of
Connolly et al. (10) for a possible involvement of a caryophyl-
lene intermediate, a mechanism consistent with the observed
labeling pattern has been developed (Fig. 6). In this mechanism
C1 forms a bond with C11 of the originating FPP molecule in
the formation of a caryophyllenyl carbocation followed by
opening of the cyclobutyl ring to yield the desired isobutenyl
side chain. Important to note, the twomethylene carbons of the
isobutenyl side are predicted to arise from C1 and C11 of the
originating FPP and hence should become labeled when
[1-13C]acetate is incorporated into FPP by the mevalonate bio-
synthetic pathway operating in yeast (32). This labeling pattern
is indeed observed and consistentwith the proposed caryophyl-
lene reaction mechanism for valerena-1,10-diene synthase.
The proposed caryophyllenyl mechanism is also sufficient to
account for the biosynthesis of pacifigorgiane sesquiterpenes
(D) in sponges and tarmariscene sesquiterpenes (8) in liver-
worts (Fig. 6). The only difference is which carbons, C10 versus
C2, participate in the formation of the fused, 5- and 6-membered
ring system and the development of the cyclopropyl ring between
carbons 1, 2, and 10 on theway to tamariscene formation. Confir-
mation of these predictions awaits the isolation and functional
characterization of the corresponding liverwort and sponge ter-
pene synthases, which should also provide new mechanistic
insights into the evolution of these unique biochemical processes
in very diverse and evolutionarily distant organisms.

FIGURE S1. (A) Screenshots of the Medicinal Plant Metabolomics Resource website 
focused on Valeriana officinalis and the specific search window for metabolites 
detected as ions within a particular molecular mass (m/z) range (upper panels). 
Search for metabolites detected as fragment ions with masses between m/z 203.1 
and m/z 203.2 whose relative abundance in the indicated tissue samples is shown in 
the lower panel.  (B) This particular metabolite is tentatively annotated as a 
sesquiterpene diol acetate consistent with downstream metabolism of valerena-1,10-
diene, and yields a fragment ion at m/z 203 (corresponding to fragmentation by loss 
of water and acetic acid), another fragment at m/z 263 (corresponding to loss of 
water), and a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 281, all with matching tissue profiles and 
retention time of 18.76 min.  The accurate masses of these ions are all consistent 
with the proposed elemental formulas for this metabolite.

FIGURE S2. Amino acid alignment of the seven terpene synthase genes from V. 
officinalis (VoTPS) in comparison to that of premnaspirodiene synthase (HPS). The 
VoTPS genes were initially identified in blast screens of the Valeriana officinalis 
transcriptome found at www.medicinalplantgenomics and subsequently confirmed by 
isolation of the corresponding cDNAs from V. officinalis root mRNA by RT-PCR. The 
aligned sequences are highlighted for highly conserved sequences like the RR(X8)W 
box (blue) associated with overall catalytic activity (1,2), the DDXXD motif (red) 
associated with coordinating a divalent metal cofactor (1,2), and the 88 amino acids 
of VoTPS3 (red overline) predicted to target this synthase to the chloroplast 
compartment as determined by the ChloroP 1.1 algorithm.

FIGURE S3. Determination of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants for VoTPS1. 
The kinetic constants were determined by incubating purified VoTPS1 enzyme with 
various concentrations of 1 to 50 µM 3H-FPP under standard assay conditions (50 ng 
of enzyme, 50 µl final reaction volume) of a 15 min incubation at 30oC. The reactions 
were stopped by extraction with hexanes and the amount of radioactivity 
incorporated into the hexanes extractable products determined by liquid scintillation 
counter. Data were analyzed using EnzymeKinetics V1.5 (Trinity Software) yielding 
kinetic values for Km = 7.2 µM, Vmax = 311.9 pmol/µg protein•hr, and kcat = 0.0057 s-1.

Figure S5. GC comparisons of the hexane extractable hydrocarbons from control 
yeast (harboring “empty” expressing vector)(A), or yeast expressing the VoTPS1 (B) 
or VoTPS7 (C) genes. The chromatograms are annotated for the elution behavior of 
germacrene C (1), valerena-1,10-diene (2) and an unidentified sesquiterpene 
compound (3), as well as the external standard cedrene (ced) and a yeast 
associated compound (unk), a non-terpene chemical as defined by MS inspection.

Figure S8. The 13C-NMR spectra for valerena-1,10-diene isolated from yeast 
expressing the VoTPS1 gene and the cultures fed 1-13C acetate (panel B) or not 
(panel A). The red box highlights the signals pertaining to C-10 and C-11.  These 
signals evince 35 Hz splittings due to the JC-C couplings of 13C enrichment at C-10 
and C-11. The mesitylene external standard signal (127.113 ppm) is also evident in 
this region of the spectra.
