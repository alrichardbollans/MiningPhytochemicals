1. Cell walls from rapidly growing cell suspension cultures of Spinacia oleracea L.
contained ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid esterified with a water-insoluble polymer.
2. Prolonged treatment with trypsin did not release any feruloyl esters from de-
arabinofuranosylated cell walls, and the polymer was also insoluble in phenol/acetic
acid/water (2: 1: 1, w/v/v). 3. Treatment of the cell walls with the fungal hydrolase
preparation 'Driselase' did liberate low-Mr feruloyl esters. The major esters were
4-0-(6-0-feruloyl-,6-D-galactopyranosyl)-D-galactose and 3?-O-(3-0-feruloyl-a-L-ara-
binopyranosyl)-L-arabinose. These two esters accounted for about 60% of the cell-wall
ferulate. 4. It is concluded that the feruloylation of cell-wall polymers is not a random
process, but occurs at very specific sites, probably on the arabinogalactan component of
pectin. 5. The possible role of such phenolic substituents in cell-wall architecture and
growth is discussed.
Lignin is a well-known phenolic component of
secondary (non-growing) cell walls, where it re-
places the water and completely prevents further
growth (Northcote, 1972). The occurrence of
phenols in primary (growing) walls, in contrast, is
less well documented, although potentially import-
ant in determining the physical properties of such
walls. Lignin itself does not seem to occur in primary
cell walls (Whitmore, 1974), but other phenols may
be quite widespread, for example, in the primary
walls of mosses (Czapek, 1899), monocotyledons
(Harris & Hartley, 1980) and dicotyledons (Mort &
Lamport, 1977; Fry, 1979). In addition, the cell-wall
proteins contain phenolic amino acids (Lamport,
1977; Fry, 1982).
One major phenol identified in both primary and
secondary cell walls of grasses is ferulic acid (Harris
& Hartley, 1976). It also occurs in many other
monocotyledons (Harris & Hartley, 1980) and in
the walls of rapidly-growing cell suspension cultures
of the dicotyledons spinach (Fry, 1979) and woad
(S. C. Fry, unpublished work). The ferulic acid is
probably ester-linked to wall polymers (Whitmore,
1974).
A hypothesis was advanced in which such
phenolic units within the primary cell wall were
subject to oxidation by extracellular peroxidases to
yield hydrophobic and cross-linked derivatives that
would lower the wall's extensibility (Fry, 1979).
Gibberellic acid was found to favour cell expansion
in the spinach cultures (Fry & Street, 1980),
possibly through suppression of peroxidase secre-
tion (Fry, 1980). Direct evidence for such cross-
linking was recently obtained for the tyrosine
residues of wall protein, by identification of an
oxidatively coupled dimer, named isodityrosine (Fry,
1982).
To assess more fully the possible consequences of
phenol-oxidation, it is important to discover where
the phenolic units are linked in the primary cell wall.
Secondary cell walls from mature wheat endosperm
contain a feruloylated arabinoxylan (Neukom,
1976), and the ferulate from secondary walls of
mature leaf blades of Lolium appeared to be
associated with xylose, arabinose and glucose
(Hartley, 1973). The precise linkages were not
determined, but both these studies suggest a feru-
loylated hemicellulose. Ferulate has also been found
linked through an amide bond to the N-terminus of a
protein (van Sumere et al., 1973). However, nothing
was known about the sites of feruloylation within
rapidly growing cell walls. Here I report the isolation

and characterization of two disaccharide fragments
from the primary cell wall of spinach with their
ferulic acid units still attached.

Sigma, cinnamic acid and caffeic acid were from
Koch-Light, Colnbrook, Bucks., U.K., and sinapic
acid was from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, U.S.A.
Diferulic acid (Geissmann & Neukom, 1971) was a
generous gift from Professor Dr. H. Neukom,
E.T.H., Ziirich, Switzerland. Cinnamoyl JJ-D-
galactoside was from Travenol Laboratories, Los
Angeles, CA, U.S.A. Radiochemicals were from

galactosidases were from Sigma.
Plant material
An auxin-independent green suspension culture
(line GIO of Dalton & Street, 1976) of spinach
(Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Monstrous Viroflay) was
maintained in Murashige & Skoog's (1962) salts
solution (with FeCl3 replaced by equimolar Fe-
EDTA) plus 1% sucrose (final pH4.4). No hor-
mones or vitamins were added. The cultures were
grown at 20-250C under continuous fluorescent
lighting (6 x 10-5einstein m-2. S-1) with orbital
shaking (diameter of orbit = 3 cm; frequency =
100min-1), at 700ml of suspension per 1-litre
flask. The flasks were plugged with cotton wool
and capped with aluminium foil. The cells were
subcultured every 2 weeks by approx. 8-fold
dilution.
Cell walls were prepared by sonication (with a
Dawe 'Soniprobe') in 100mM-sodium acetate buffer
(pH5.0) containing 3mM-CaCl2, followed by bench
centrifugation. The treatment was repeated until the
pellet was no longer green; nuclei were also shown to
be absent at this stage by u.v.-microscopy after
staining with ethidium bromide (Blaschek et al.,
1974). Where necessary, the cell walls were further
treated as follows. Removal of non-covalently bound
protein and glycoprotein was performed in phenol/
acetic acid/water (2:1 :1, w/v/v) at 700C for 1 h.
This treatment was shown to remove over 90% of
the radioactivity from the walls of cells cultured for
several days in the presence of L-[35S]methionine.
Arabinofuranose residues of wall polymers were
hydrolysed with 30mM-oxalic acid at 100°C for 3 h;
this treatment was shown to remove essentially all
the arabinose from spinach cell walls, but little of the
other sugars.
Enzymic hydrolysis ofcell walls
De-arabinofuranosylated cell walls (100mg dry
wt.) were incubated for 5 days with the trypsin (6 ml
at 8mg/ml in 20mM-CaCl2/5OmM-Tris/HCl buffer,
pH 8.0) at 300C under a trace of toluene.
Driselase (a fungal enzyme preparation con-
taining polysaccharide exo- and endo-hydrolases
including cellulase, pectinase, /.-xylanase and ,B-
mannanase) contained phenolic contaminants. These
did not include ferulate or p-coumarate, but they
were removed as follows. The incompletely soluble
powder (5 g) was gently stirred for 2 h at 40C with
50 ml of 50mM-sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and
centrifuged (25 000g at 40C for 15 min). The clear
supernatant was brought to 75% saturation with
(NH4)2SO4 and re-centrifuged. The pellet was
washed once with 75% saturated (NH4)2SO4, and
re-dissolved in a minimal volume of water. The
enzyme was de-salted on Sephadex G-25, freeze-
dried and stored at -200C.
For digestion with Driselase, cell walls were
suspended (20mg dry wt.-ml-') in 25mM-sodium
acetate buffer (pH5.0) containing 0.01% sodium
azide, and mixed thoroughly to form a paste. The
paste was dispensed on a wet-weight basis into
the enzyme solution (final enzyme concentration
usually 0.6%) in the same buffer. In non-radioactive
experiments, control incubations were always per-
formed simultaneously in the absence of cell walls.
Digestion was stopped by boiling (5 min) or by
drying on chromatography paper.
Enzymic hydrolysis of galactose-containing disac-
charides
For determination of the anomeric configuration
of galactosides, samples were incubated at 200C for
16h either with green-coffee-bean a-galactosidase
(1 unit/ml of 50 mM-pyridine acetate buffer, pH 6.5)
or with Escherichia coli,-galactosidase (100units/
ml of 50mM-Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5). Control hy-
drolyses with melibiose and lactose showed that the
enzymes were absolutely specific, within the limits of
the chromatographic assay.
Alkaline hydrolysis
Feruloyl and related esters were completely
hydrolysed by incubation in 0.1 M-NaOH at 20°C
for 16 h under N2 in the dark. (For the partial
hydrolysis shown in Fig. 1, shorter treatments with
0.5 M-NaOH were used.) For analysis of total
reaction products, the solution (lOl00,ul) was
acidified with 2equiv. of acetic acid and spotted or
streaked on chromatography paper. Alternatively,
where only the phenolic acids were to be analysed,
the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with H3PO4 and the
solution was partitioned against ethyl acetate; the
organic phase was chromatographed.

Phenolic components of the cell wall
Analysis ofsugars
Periodate oxidation was performed with tracer
levels of radioactive sugars in 0.1 ml 50mM-NaIO4 in
0.25M-sodium formate buffer, pH3.5, at 40C for 6
days. Unreacted periodate was destroyed with 20,ul
of ethane-1,2-diol for a further 16 h.
Borohydride reduction was achieved with excess
0.25M-KBH4 in 0.5M-NH4OH at 200C for 2h.
Remaining borohydride was then destroyed by
addition of acetic acid to pH4.7. Cations were
removed on a short column of Zeo-Karb (H+ form)
and the eluate was dried in vacuo to remove acetic
acid, and re-dried from methanol several times to
remove H3BO3 as its volatile methyl ester.
Acid hydrolysis was performed in 40100Op1 of
0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 M-trifluoroacetic acid in a sealed
glass tube at 1200C for 1-1.5 h. The cooled samples
were loaded directly on paper (without heating) for
chromatography.
Crude preparations of D-galactokinase and L-
arabinokinase were obtained from mung-bean seed-
lings as described by Neufeld et al. (1960). The
preparation was incubated with radioactive sugar in
the presence of 20mM-ATP, 40mM-KF, 10mM-
MgCl2 and 40mM-Tris/HCl buffer (pH7.5); total
final volume was 204u1. After 6h at 200C, the
reaction mixture was electrophoresed at pH 3.5. The
radioactive sugar 1-phosphates (co-electrophores-
ing approximately with a picric acid marker) were
assayed.
Chromatography and electrophoresis
Unless otherwise stated, Whatman no. 1 paper
and 'MN Polygram' silica gel G thin layers were
used for chromatography. Solvents are listed in
Table 1. High-voltage electrophoresis was per-
formed on Whatman no. 1 paper (effective path
length 50cm) in tanks of white spirit as coolant
(20-300C). Buffers, voltages and times are listed in
Table 1.
Hydroxycinnamic acids were located by
fluorescence under long-wavelength u.v. light (with
and without NH3), or by their brown staining with I2
vapour (this also stains cinnamic acid itself, al-
though weakly), or by their blue staining with Folin
and Ciocalteu's phenol reagent followed by NH3. On
paper, free ferulic acid fluoresced blue, turning bright
blue with NH3; authentic feruloyl esters fluoresced
blue, turning intensely blue-green with NH3. p-
Coumaric acid was invisible before treatment with
NH3, but fluoresced violet in its presence; authentic
p-coumaroyl esters were also invisible without NH3,
but fluoresced blue in its presence.
Sugars, sugar alcohols and saccharinic acids were
stained with AgNO3/NaOH, and amino acids and
peptides with ninhydrin (Harborne, 1973).
Preparation ofauthentic hydroxycinnamoyl esters
Several feruloyl and p-coumaroyl esters were
synthesized to assist in the recognition of natural
esters. Ferulic acid or p-coumaric acid (10mg) was
dissolved in 2.5ml of the appropriate alcohol (gly-
cerol, ethane- 1,2-diol, propane- 1,2-diol, methanol,
ethanol or butanol). Concentrated H2SO4 (0.1 ml)
was added, and the mixture was incubated at 500C
for 2 h. The products were diluted into 100ml of
0.4 M-sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, and par-
titioned against 10ml of diethyl ether to extract the
ester. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness
and the residual ester was re-dissolved in acetone
and stored at 40C in the dark. Since the alcohols
were in excess, the di- and tri-hydric alcohols would
yield mainly their mono-esters. Each preparation
gave one major spot on t.l.c. in system 9 (RF values:
glyceryl ferulate, 0.015; 2-hydroxyethyl ferulate,
0.09; hydroxypropyl ferulate, 0.12; methyl ferulate,
0.46; ethyl ferulate, 0.50; butyl ferulate, 0.57; cf.
ferulic acid, 0.42). The six feruloyl esters were
indistinguishable from each other by u.v.-
fluorescence and staining, but were quite different
from the corresponding p-coumaroyl esters.
Isolation ofnatural hydroxycinnamoyl esters
The two major natural feruloyl esters investigated
in this work were named compounds (29) and (59)
from their RF values (x 100) in system 1. For detailed
studies, they were isolated and purified as follows.
After removal of non-covalently bound protein, cell
walls (200mg dry wt.) were incubated with 0.6%
purified Driselase (10ml) in 25mM-sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.0, at 250C with gentle shaking for 16h
under a trace of toluene. Methanol was then added
to 35% (v/v), the reaction was stopped by boiling
(5 min) and insoluble material was removed by
centrifugation. The supernatant was chromato-
graphed in the dark on Sephadex LH-20 (gel bed
2.5cmx40cm) in 35% methanol, and 150 1.2-ml
fractions were collected. Four peaks of feruloyl
esters were detected (see Table 2). Each fraction was
dried in vacuo (with a 'Speed-Vac'; Savant Instru-
ments), re-dissolved in a little water and chro-
matographed in system 1. Fluorescent material ofRF
0.29 (compound 29) was eluted with water, and
further purified by paper electrophoresis at pH 2.0
and 6.5, followed by chromatography of the neutral
fraction in systems 3, 4 and 8. System 4 resolved
compound (29) from the corresponding p-coumar-
oyl derivative, compound (29').
Compound (59) was eluted from the above
system- I chromatogram (RF = 0.59) and purified as
described for compound (29). System 4 resolved
compound (59) from the p-coumaroyl derivative
compound (59').

Quantitative assay offerulic acid and its esters
Ferulic acid and the feruloyl esters were esti-
mated spectrophotometrically in aqueous solution
by use of the constants given in Table 2. Un-
identified feruloyl esters were assayed at pH 10 from
A370, using the value log8(M-'-cm-') = 4.45, as
determined for compound (29).
Radioisotopic methods
For uniform '4C-labelling, a suspension culture
(10ml) was grown in a 50-ml flask in the normal
medium, except that the sucrose was replaced by
1.0% D-[U-'4CIglucose (2.0x 107 Bq) as sole car-
bon source. After 11 days, approx. 70% of the 14C
had been removed from the medium; cell walls were
then isolated as normal.
Radioactivity was determined on strips of chro-
matography paper by liquid-scintillation counting in
0.5% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in toluene with a
Searle Mk III counter at an efficiency of approx.
20%. For re-chromatography after scintillation
counting, the strips were washed with toluene, dried
and eluted with water. This was not possible with
free ferulic acid, which is soluble in toluene and
therefore had to be re-chromatographed from a
replicate profile that was not scintillation-counted.
Results and discussion
Hydroxycinnamic acid composition
Cell walls isolated from rapidly growing spinach
cultures showed NH3-enhanced u.v.-fluorescence.
The fluorescent material was removed from the wall
during mild alkaline hydrolysis. Essentially all the
fluorescent material in the alkaline digest (after
acidification) partitioned into ethyl acetate, showing
that it was no longer associated with polymers. T.l.c.
in system 9 showed that the major phenolic
component thus released was ferulic acid (about
13 nmol/mg dry walls), which would account for the
cell-wall fluorescence. Smaller amounts of p-cou-
maric acid and several unidentified phenols were also
detected.
Treatment with phenol, oxalic acid and trypsin
Removal of non-covalently bound proteins with
phenol/acetic acid/water (2 :1:1) did not affect
cell-wall fluorescence. About half the ferulate also
remained in the cell walls during hydrolysis of the
arabinofuranose residues with oxalic acid. Sub-
sequent prolonged treatment of the residue with a
high concentration of trypsin [conditions devised by
Lamport (1977) for proteolysis of wall protein]
failed to diminish the cell-wall fluorescence and did
not release any u.v.-fluorescent material that was
mobile on chromatography (system 1) or electro-
phoresis (pH 2.0). Intensely ninhydrin-positive spots
of lysine, arginine and numerous peptides were
detected, demonstrating the activity of the enzyme.
The results show that the oxalic acid-resistant
feruloyl residues were not attached to proteins linked
either covalently or non-covalently in the cell wall.
Of the ferulate that was removed from the cell
walls with oxalic acid, only about 8% was free
ferulic acid, about 25% was polysaccharide-bound
(insoluble in 85% ethanol) and the rest was in the
form of chromatographically mobile compounds
with the characteristics of feruloyl esters. The major
one of these showed an RF of 0.59 in system 1.
Digestion with Driselase
Partially purified Driselase was applied to spinach
cell walls for 24h, and the entire reaction mixture
was then chromatographed in system 1. Four spots
were found with the fluorescence characteristics of
feruloyl esters at RF 0.00, 0.20 (faint), 0.29 and 0.59.
These are referred to as compounds (00), (20), (29)
and (59), and they accounted for 33, 7, 31 and 29%
respectively of the total cell-wall ferulate (values
obtained by assay of sodium ferulate released from
strips of the chromatogram by NaOH). No free
ferulic acid (RF 0.88) was present. Incubation of
Driselase in the absence of cell walls did not result in
the formation of the fluorescent spots. Time courses
showed that compound (59) was exhaustively
released by much shorter Driselase treatments than
those required for compound (29). Prolonged treat-
ment of isolated compounds (29) and (59) with more
Driselase revealed no interconversion.
Compound (29) appeared to be a single molecular
species. Impure compound (29), eluted from a
system-1 chromatogram, gave single spots with the
fluorescence characteristics of a feruloyl ester on
re-chromatography in systems 2, 3, 4 and 8 (Table
1). Only systems 5 and 15 gave two spots: these
were interconvertible by exposure to u.v.-light,
suggesting cis/trans isomerism of the feruloyl
moiety. Compound (29) was neutral on electro-
phoresis at pH 2.0 and 6.5, demonstrating the
absence of free amino and carboxy groups. It moved
towards the anode in borate buffer (pH 9.4) and gave
a single spot in this system too. Borate electro-
phoresis would probably have resolved pairs of
feruloyl sugars differing in the nature of the sugar
moiety or in the position of feruloylation. Com-
pound (59) was also a single neutral species by all
the above criteria.
The absorbance maxima of purified compounds
(29) and (59) and of authentic feruloyl esters are
given in Table 2. In 0.2 M-NaOH/Na2CO3 buffer
(pH 12.83) at 220C, the spectra of compounds (29)
and (59) rapidly decayed (Table 2) and came to
resemble that of sodium ferulate. The fluorescent
products of such alkaline treatment were shown by
t.l.c. in system 9 to be ferulate and a trace of
p-coumarate. Treatment of compounds (29) and

Samples were prepared under normal laboratory lighting, and were therefore equilibrium mixtures of the cis and trans
isomers. The spectra were prepared in aqueous solution containing dilute acetic acid (pH approx. 3), dilute NH40H
(pH approx. 10) or 1.0M-NaOH (pH approx. 14). Abbreviations used: d, decomposition; n.d., not determined. The

were esters of polyhydric alcohols (cf. ethyl ferulate
and hydroxyethyl ferulate in Table 2).
Identification ofcompound (29)
An attempt was made to discover what com-
ponents besides ferulate were present in compound
(29). Radioactive compound (29) was isolated from
uniformly '4C-labelled cell walls, and purified by
chromatography and electrophoresis. The '4C-
labelled compound (29) was treated with 0.5 M-
NaOH for various periods and then re-chromato-
graphed in butan-1-ol/formic acid/water (15:3:5,
by vol.). Brief treatments (3 min) with NaOH yielded
three products (A, C and F) (Fig. lb). During longer
S. C. Fry
treatments (30 min), product (C) disappeared and
only products A and F were present (Fig. 1c).
Isolated product (C) treated with NaOH for 30min

Compound (B) was chromatographed in system 2
and electrophoresed in borate; in both systems it ran
precisely with an internal marker of D-galactose
(stained with aniline hydrogen phthalate after

Compound (A) was converted completely and
solely into compound (B) (galactose) on treatment
with trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 M; 1200C for 1 h),

with the mobilities of galactitol (dulcitol) and

Fig. 2. Borohydride reduction products of the feruloyl
esters (29) and (59)
Uniformly "4C-labelled compounds (29) (a) and (59)
(b) were treated with KBH4, freed of cations on
Zeo-Karb and hydrolysed in 0.5 M-trifluoroacetic
acid (120°C for 1 h). The products were chro-
matographed for 16h in butan-2-one/acetic acid/
boric acid-saturated water (9 :1 :1, by vol.) and the
profile of radioactivity was obtained. The positions
are shown of non-radioactive sugars and alcohols,
added as internal markers and stained after scin-
tillation counting. Marker ferulic acid had a very
high RF and was lost off the end of the paper. The
counts are uncorrected for background, which is
shown as a broken line.
Mild acid hydrolysis (10mM-trifluoroacetic acid
at 1200C for 1Ih) did not affect the RF of compound
(A) in solvent 1, but stronger hydrolysis (100mM-
trifluoroacetic acid at 1200 C for 1lh) gave over 95%
conversion into galactose. In the same experiment,
lactose behaved like compound (A), whereas a
mixture of hydroxyproline [3H]arabinofuranosides
(isolated from spinach cell-wall glycoprotein by
alkaline hydrolysis; S. C. Fry, unpublished work)
was 70% hydrolysed to [3Hlarabinose by the 10mM
acid. This suggests that the D-galactose residue of
compound (A) was in the relatively acid-resistant
pyranosyl form.
Electrophoresis of reduced disaccharides (gly-
cosyl alditols) in the presence of molybdate has been
proposed as a means of determining sugar linkages
(Weigel, 1963). Mobility in the case of galacto-
syl galactitols is bestowed solely by the galactitol
moiety and may be unaffected, halved or nullified by
substitution (or removal) of hydroxy groups,
depending on their position. Since galactitol is sym-
metrical, the results will be ambiguous. However,
since reduced compound (A) had a mobility in
molybdate approximately half those of 1-deoxy-
L-galactitol ('D-fucitol'), 1-0-methyl-L-galactitol ('6-
0-methyl-D-galactitol') and 2-deoxy-D-lyxo-hexitol
('2-deoxy-D-galactitol'), and equal to that of maltitol
(Table 3), it follows that the galactitol moiety of
reduced compound (A) was 3-0- (or '4-0-') sub-
stituted. Thus, compound (A) was 3- or 4-0-
galactosyl galactose.
Electrophoresis of compound (A) (unmodified) in
borate gave a single peak with mGlC = 0.45 (Table 3).
By comparison with the mobilities of marker sugars
run simultaneously (Table 3) and with the mobili-
ties of 3-O-fl-D-Galp-D-Gal (mGIC = 0.69), 4-0-fl-
D-Galp-D-Gal (mGIC = 0.48), 6-0-f-D-Galp-D-Gal
(mGIC = 0.84) and D-galactose (mG1C = 0.95) reported
by Bouveng & Meier (1959), this strongly suggests a
1-4 linked disaccharide.
Support for this conclusion came from the
identification of compound (D). The alkali-break-
down products of disaccharides are characteristic
of the linkage (Whistler & BeMiller, 1958). The
non-reducing residue may be released as the mono-
saccharide, whereas the reducing moiety is de-
graded to a metasaccharinate, an isosaccharinate or
lactate, from 1-.3, 1-4 and 1 -6 linked disac-
charides respectively (1-.2 linked disaccharides are
stable to alkali). The chromatogram shown in Fig.
1 (d) resolved isosaccharinate, glucometasacchar-
inate, galactometasaccharinate and lactate; and
compound (D) ran exactly with authentic isosac-
charinate.
From all these results together, it can be deduced
that compound (A) is 4-0-fl-D-galactopyranosyl-
D-galactose.

de-feruloylated derivative (A), was completely resist-
ant to Driselase and fJ-galactosidase. Glycosidases
are generally rather non-specific for the aglycone,
and Driselase readily hydrolysed cinnamoyl f6-D-
galactopyranoside (S. C. Fry, unpublished work).
This suggests that the feruloyl residue of compound
(29) was on the (non-reducing) J-D-galactopyrano-
syl unit. In an investigation of the linkage of this
ferulate, '4C-labelled compound (29) was oxidized
with NaIO4 under conditions that would retain the
ester linkage intact and also minimize overoxidation
(Neumiiller & Vasseur, 1953) and then reduced with
KBH4, acidified on Zeo-Karb, washed with ethyl
acetate to remove some ferulate-oxidation products,
hydrolysed (1 M-trifluoroacetic acid at 1200C for
lh) and chromatographed in system 1. The prin-
cipal non-volatile radioactive products co-chro-
matographed with authentic threitol and glycerol
(Fig. 3b). These identities were confirmed by
re-chromatography in system 2. Similar results (Fig.
3a) were obtained if the ferulate was first split off the
disaccharide of compound (29) (in situ in 0.5M-
NaOH at 200C for 30min, before the addition of
formic acid to pH 3.5); in this case, the [l4Cl-
glycerol would arise from C-4, C-5 and C-6 of the
non-reducing galactose unit, and the [l4Clthreitol
from C-3 to C-6 of the reducing unit (Panayotatos
& Villemez, 1973). If the non-reducing residue in
compound (29) were O-feruloylated at C-2, C-3, C-4
or C-6, it would yield glyceraldehyde + glycerol,
galactose, threitol or glycerol respectively. How-
ever, non-radioactive carrier glyceraldehyde was
completely degraded to AgNO3/NaOH-negative
products during the trifluoroacetic acid treatment.
The results (Fig. 3b) therefore suggest O-feru-
loylation at C-2 or C-6.
(The unidentified peak running 5cm from the
origin of Figs. 3a-3d only arose during prolonged
periodate-oxidation, and, unlike the glycerol and
threitol, was not present in 16-h oxidations. It was
probably derived from ferulate.)
Since product (C) (see Fig. lb) was composed of
ferulate and disaccharide (A), it must have been an
isomer of compound (29) with the feruloyl residue
on a different hydroxy group. 6-O-Feruloyl sugars
have markedly lower RF values than the corre-
sponding 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-O-feruloyl sugars, which
are not well resolved from each other (Birkofer et a!.,
1966). It is therefore likely that compound (29) was
6'-O-feruloyl-disaccharide (A), and that the faster
migrating product (C) was a mixture of 2'-, 3'-, and
4'-O-feruloyl-disaccharide (A), formed from com-
pound (29) by alkali-catalysed acyl-migration.
Compound (29) is therefore proposed to be 4-0-
(6-0-feruloyl-,8-D-galactopyranosyl)-D-galactose.
Identification ofcompound (59)
'4C-Labelled compound (59) was isolated from
uniformly 14C-labelled cell walls and purified by
chromatography and electrophoresis. The kinetics of
alkaline hydrolysis (Figs. le-lh) were simpler than
for compound (29), suggesting the reaction:

compound (59) oxidized after NaOH treatment; (d) compound (59) oxidized without NaOH treatment. For (a) and
(c), the radioactive ester was first treated with 0.5 M-NaOH at 200C for 30min to split off the feruloyl groups (cf.
Figs. Ic and ig), and then sufficient dilute formic acid was added to convert the medium into 0.25 M-sodium formate
buffer, pH 3.5 (final volume approx. 0.1 ml). For (b) and (d), the intact esters were dissolved directly in 0.1 ml
0.25 M-sodium formate buffer, pH 3.5. After cooling to 40C, NaTO4 was added to 0.05M, and oxidation was
conducted for 6 days at 4°C. After destruction of excess NaIO4 with 0.02 ml of ethane- 1,2-diol, the products were
reduced with KBH4, freed of cations on Zeo-Karb, washed with ethyl acetate, acid-hydrolysed and chro-
matographed in system 1. These radioactive profiles are uncorrected for background, which is shown as a broken
line.
Compound (H) was identified as ferulic acid by
t.l.c. in system 9.
Compound (G) ran in system 1 with authentic
pentoses (arabinose and xylose; not resolved). In
system 2 it ran slightly faster than arabinose but
slower than xylose. Acid hydrolysis (100mM-tri-
fluoroacetic acid at 1200C for lh) or Driselase
treatment converted it solely and completely into
arabinose (identified by chromatography in system 2
and electrophoresis in borate). This arabinose was
90% phosphorylated by L-arabinokinase in the
presence of ATP, showing it to be L-arabinose.
Reduction of compound (59) or (G) with KBH4
followed by acid hydrolysis yielded two equal peaks
corresponding to arabinose and arabinitol (Fig. 2b).
These data show that compound (G) was a reducing
disaccharide of L-arabinose.
Mild acid hydrolysis (10mM-trifluoroacetic acid
at 1200 C for IIh) had no effect on compound (G),
suggesting an arabinopyranosyl unit. However, mild
oxalic acid-hydrolysis of cell walls liberated a
feruloyl ester that co-chromatographed with com-

pound (59) (see above). Therefore the reducing
arabinose unit of compound (59) was probably
furanosidically linked to a wall polymer. Thus the
glycosidic linkage in compound (59) could not have
been 1-4.
Reduced compound (G) (L-arabinopyranosyl-L-
arabinitol) had a moderate electrophoretic mobility
in molybdate (Table 3). Methyl arabinopyranosides
are immobile in molybdate, but arabinitol has a high
mobility (Weigel, 1963). Therefore, as with reduced
compound (A), the mobility of reduced compound
(G) will be bestowed solely by the alditol moiety.
Removal (and therefore presumably also substi-
tution) of the C-2 hydroxy group of arabinitol
completely prevents molybdate binding, as shown
by the immobility of 2-deoxy-erythro-pentitol ('2-
deoxyarabinitol') (Weigel, 1963). Removal of the
C-5 hydroxy group of arabinitol has no effect on
molybdate binding, as shown by the high mobility of
1-deoxylyxitol ('5-deoxyarabinitol') (Weigel, 1963).
The effect of removal or substitution of the hydroxy
group at C-3 of arabinitol has not been studied;
however, the four hydroxy groups of 3-0-sub-
stituted L-arabinitol can adopt positions identical
with those at C- I, C-2, C-4 and C-5 of 3-0-
methyl-L-gulitol, which has a moderate mobility in
molybdate (Weigel, 1963). The moderate mobility of
reduced compound (G) is therefore likely to be due
to 0-substitution of the arabinitol moiety at C-3.
Thus the glycosidic linkage in compound (G) is 1-+3.
3-0-fJ-L-Arabinopyranosyl-L-arabinose has been
isolated from gum, and has a relatively low RF in
several chromatographic systems (Andrews &
Jones, 1954). Compound (G),-in contrast, is remark-
able in being a disaccharide with an RF (in system 2)
higher than that of its constituent monosaccharide.
This characteristic is also exhibited by 3-0-JJ-D-
xylopyranosyl-D-xylose (Howard, 1957), and indi-
cates that compound (G) is 3-0-a-L-arabinopyrano-
syl-L-arabinose, since the Jl-D linkage is identical
with the a-L.
The electrophoretic mobility of compound (G)
(unmodified) in borate (mGIC = 0.58; Table 3) is also
compatible with a 1 -3 linkage (Weigel, 1963).
Periodate oxidation of compound (G) gave
negligible amounts of ["4Clerythritol (which co-
chromatographs in system 1 with threitol), sug-
gesting that extensive overoxidation was occurring
despite the mild conditions (Fig. 3c). Disaccharides
with 1 -3 linkages are known to be extremely
susceptible to overoxidation (Neumiiller & Vasseur,
1953). The only recognizable product was [14C]-
glycerol, which would arise from C-2, C-3 and C-4
of the reducing arabinose unit by overoxidation.
However, periodate-oxidation of compound (59)
with the ferulate group still attached gave (in
addition to [14C]glycerol) a prominent peak of '4C in
the pentose zone (Fig. 3d). This was identified in
system 2 as arabinose, showing that the non-
reducing arabinose unit of compound (59) was
0-feruloylated at C-3.
The structure of compound (59) is concluded
to be 3-0-(3-0-feruloyl-a-L-arabinopyranosyl)-L-
arabinose.
p-Coumaroyl derivatives
Chromatography of crude Driselase-digests in
system 1 yielded fluorescent spots, the leading edge
of which fluoresced blue in NH3 vapour (cf.
blue-green for feruloyl esters). Two-dimensional
chromatography (systems 1 and 4) resulted in more
complete resolution of the blue and blue-green
spots. In the case of both compounds (29) and (59),
alkaline hydrolysis of the blue-green spot released
ferulate, whereas the blue spot gave p-coumarate
(identified in system 9). The faster-running blue-
fluorescing compounds (29' and 59'; for spectral
properties see Table 2) are concluded to be p-
coumaroyl versions of the major (feruloyl) esters.
The possible nature oftheferuloylatedpolymer
At least 60% of the ferulate of spinach cell walls
occurs in two highly specific linkages, characterized
here as 4-0-(6-0-feruloyl-fl-D-galactopyranosyl)-
D-galactose and 3-0-(3-0-feruloyl-a-L-arabino-
pyranoSyl)-L-arabinose. The stability of these di-
saccharides to Driselase was probably due to the
feruloyl groups preventing glycosidases from recog-
nizing the (non-reducing) glycosyl residue.
D-Galactose and L-arabinose are characteristic of
three major cell wall polymers: (1) pectins, (2)
covalently-bound glycoprotein ('extensin'), and (3)
salt-soluble arabinogalactan-proteins. Of these, only
the pectins contain the sequence Galpf >1-4Gal. In
contrast, the covalently bound protein has single
galactose residues, which are a-linked to serine; and
the arabinogalactan-proteins contain only 1-.3 and
1-.6 sequences of galactose (O'Neill & Selvendran,
1980; Aspinall, 1980). These facts, together with the
insolubility of the feruloylated polymer in phenol and
in trypsin, suggest that the ferulate was attached to
pectin rather than protein.
The present work does not establish the number of
consecutive galactose residues in the feruloyl poly-
mer. Firm evidence was obtained for two. However,
the results are compatible with a feruloyl f-galactan,
as previously conjectured in potato cell walls
(Friend, 1976).
The arabinose residues of pectins (and other wall
polymers) are usually in the furanose form, but a few
arabinopyranose residues are also present (North-
cote, 1972; Darvill et al., 1978). My results show
that a large proportion of the cell wall's ferulate is
linked to such arabinopyranose residues. This
implies that the addition of phenols to cell-wall
polymers is not a random process. Feruloyltrans-
1982
502
Phenolic components of the cell wall 503
ferases must therefore exist with a very high
specificity for the feruloyl acceptor, although pos-
sibly also functioning in p-coumaroyl transfer.
Feruloyl-coenzyme A and p-coumaroyl-coenzyme
A are likely to act as donors.
Functional aspects
Peroxidase has been shown in vitro to catalyse the
covalent cross-linking of an artificially feruloylated
polysaccharide (guaran) through diferuloyl (bi-
phenyl) bridges, and of p-coumaroylated guaran
through unidentified bridges (Geissmann &
Neukom, 1971). Diferuloyl bridges also occur
naturally in cell walls (Markwalder & Neukom,
1976; Hartley & Jones, 1976; Harris & Hartley,
1980). In addition, it has been suggested that ferulate
could oxidatively couple with tyrosine to form a
hybrid biphenyl, which would link polysaccharides
to proteins (Neukom & Markwalder, 1978). A
further type of oxidative coupling has been demon-
strated between carbohydrates and phenols (prob-
ably as quinone methides) to form sugar-phenol
ethers (Freudenberg & Grion, 1959; Harkin, 1967;
see also Whitmore, 1976). Another plausible mode
of cross-linking involves oxidation of the phenol (e.g.
caffeate) to a hydroxyquinone, followed by che-
lation of Ca2+ by two adjacent hydroxyquinones
(Painter & Neukom, 1968). Any of these coupling
reactions would result in a binding together of the
phenol-bearing polysaccharides within the cell wall,
perhaps thereby restricting cell expansion.
A similar hypothesis was recently advanced for
the cross-linking of wall glycoprotein through
isodityrosine, an oxidatively coupled dimer of
tyrosine (Fry, 1982).
Phenolic coupling reactions are feasible in the cell
wall, since there are abundant peroxidase iso-
enzymes, and systems exist for the generation of
cell-wall H202 (Gross et al., 1977). Numerous
examples have been reported of a negative correla-
tion between rates of cell expansion and peroxidase
levels (van Overbeek, 1935; Kamerbeek, 1956;
McCune & Galston, 1959; Palmieri et al., 1978;
Fry, 1979, 1980). It is possible that this reflects a
causal relationship, the peroxidase restricting growth
by catalysing the oxidative coupling of pectin-bound
phenols. The growth promoter gibberellic acid, for
example, by inhibiting the secretion of peroxidase
into the cell wall (Fry, 1979, 1980), may prevent the
occurrence of phenolic coupling and thereby favour
cell expansion. In this connection it is interesting that
gibberellic acid-treated cells appear to shed pectins
(Fry, 1980), presumably owing to reduced cross-
linking within the cell wall.
Evidence that phenolic compounds do contribute
to the binding of polymers in the cell wall comes
from degradative studies. Acidified sodium chlorite,
originally developed as a de-lignifying agent by virtue
of its ability to cleave aromatic polymers, is able to
solubilize some otherwise water-insoluble cell-wall
protein and polysaccharides (O'Neill & Selvendran,
1980; Fry, 1982). Similarly, pretreatment of cell
walls with methanolic sodium methoxide will render
some hemicelluloses water-soluble, possibly by split-
ting phenolic esters (Morrison, 1977); and 0.1M-
Na2CO3 will solubilize some galacturonan, possibly
by hydrolysis of phenolic esters (Jarvis et al., 1981).
