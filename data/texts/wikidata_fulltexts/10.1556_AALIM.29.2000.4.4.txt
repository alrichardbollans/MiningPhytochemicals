HÓVÁRIJózsef Fodor National Center of Public Health, National Institute of Food Hygiene and Nutrition,H-1097 Budapest, Gyáli út 3/a. Hungary(Received: 7 February 2000, accepted: 11 May 2000)The content of the potentially health-defensive and disease-preventive flavonoidsquercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 31 vegetables were determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Vegetables were purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a periodof their most frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables weregenerally below 10 mg kg1, except for onions (67121.5 mg kg1), lettuce (13.535.0 mg kg1),dill (74.5 mg kg1), broccoli (15.5 mg kg1) and spinach (272.2 mg kg1). Kaempferol was below30 mg kg1 except for parsnip (66.4 mg kg1) and leek (45.8 mg kg1). Myricetin could only bedetected in lettuce, Swedish turnip, parsley and celery leaves, and dill. Detectable amount ofluteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet peppers, celery leaves andspinach while apigenin was only in Swedish turnip, celery root and celery leaves. These dataprovide a basis for the evaluation of the average daily intake of Hungarian population and for anepidemiological evaluation of health-promoting effects of flavonoids.Keywors: flavonoid aglycons, vegetablesFlavonoids are ubiquitous in all plant organs and are, therefore, an integral partof the human diet. Flavonoids are widespread secondary plant metabolites and are foundat high levels in many plant foods and beverages. Their common structure is that ofdiphenylpropanes (C6-C3-C6) and consists of two aromatic rings linked through threecarbons that usually form an oxygenated heterocycle (BRAVO, 1998). Flavonoids occurin foods generally as O-glycosides with sugars bound usually at the C3 position.Flavonoids consist mainly of anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, catechins, isoflavonoidsand flavanes (HERMANN, 1988). Although flavonoids are generally considered to benon-nutritive agents, interest in these substances has arisen because of possible effectson human health. Researchers demonstrated a wide range of biochemical andpharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic effect (MANACHet al., 1996, HERTOG, 1996). Food derived flavonoids such as the flavonol quercetin,kaempferol and myricetin have antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects in vitro andin vivo (VERMA et al, 1988, DESCHNER et al., 1991, DUTHIE et al., 1997 a, b, 1999,0139-3006/2000/$ 5.00  2000 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest346 LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODSKUNTZ et al., 1999). Epidemiological researches on the relation between flavonoidintake and risk of cardiovascular diseases pointed out the protective effect of theconsumption of vegetables and fruits having significant amount of flavonoids (MELTZER& MALTERUD, 1997, KATAN& HOLLMAN, 1998, HERTOG et al., 1995).Total flavonoid intake in the US was estimated to be around 1 g/day, of whichabout 100 mg (expressed as aglycones) consisted of flavonols and flavones (KÜHNAU,1976). These estimates were based on food composition data, which may have beeninaccurate and incomplete. HERTOG and co-workers (1993b) calculated the intake oftwo types of flavonoids, flavonols and flavones in the Dutch diet, and found it to be23 mg/day. This figure is significantly smaller than KÜHNAUs (1976) estimation of115 mg/day for these two flavonoids, which is allegedly overestimated because of theunreliability of the analytical method employed during the 1970s. The main foodsources of the flavonoids in the Netherlands were black tea (48% of total intake), onions(29%) and apples (7%). More recently, LETH and JUSTESEN (1998) estimated the intakeof flavones, flavonols, and flavonones in Denmark to be 28 mg/day. KUMPULAINEN andco-workers (1999) reported that the total average intake of 23 different flavonoidaglycons in Finland based on their food composition data was 55.2 mg/day, where fruitscontributed 36.5 mg/day followed by tea, wine and other, non-alcoholic beverages(13.9 mg/day, vegetables (2.9 mg/day) and berries (2.0 mg/day).On the basis of data from the literature (HERTOG et al, 1992b, 1993a,KUMPULAINEN, 1999) we selected three major flavonols, quercetin, kaempferol, andmyricetin, and two major flavones, luteolin and apigenin because these flavonoids arethe most widely investigated in animal and human studies for their beneficial healtheffects. We adapted an HPLC method for the identification and quantification of theseflavonoids in freeze-dried foods. We have now measured the content of these flavonoidsin 31 vegetables commonly consumed in Hungary. We have also intended to comparethe Hungarian analytical data to Dutch ones published by HERTOG and co-workers(1992b).1. Materials and methods1.1. ChemicalsQuercetin, luteolin, myricetin, kaempferol and t-butylhydroquinone werepurchased from Sigma, apigenin from Fluka and methanol of chromatography grade wasobtained from Merck. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade fromReanal (Hungary).Acta Alimentaria 29, 2000LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODS 3471.2. VegetablesThirty-one selected fresh vegetables (1 kg, or a minimum of three units) werepurchased from 3 different stallkeepers in the local markets in Budapest at a period oftheir most frequent consumption. The edible parts of the vegetables were used for theexamination, and samples from three locations were combined. After buying, thesamples were immediately cleaned, chopped into small pieces and freeze-dried. Afterlyophilization, samples were allowed to equilibrate in open air and ground to pass a0.5 mm sieve. Moisture was measured by drying at 105 °C. The food samples werestored at 18 °C for less than 4 months until analyzed.1.3. HPLC analysisThe flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) and the flavones (apigenin,luteolin) were measured as aglycons according to HERTOG and co-workers (1992a).Briefly, flavonoid glycosides were extracted and hydrolyzed to their aglycons with 6.0 NHCl in boiling 62.5% aqueous methanol in the presence of 0.1 g t-butylhydroquinonefor two hours. After refluxing the extract was allowed to cool and was subsequentlymade up to 50 ml with methanol and sonicated for 5 min. Approximately 2 ml wasfiltered through 0.45 µm filter (Chromafil AO-20/25) before injection. The resultingaglycons were quantified by RP-HPLC (Perkin Elmer) on a Premisphere C18column(150×3.9 mm, 5 µm, Phenomenex, USA) using methanol/phosphate buffer (45:55 v/v,pH 2.4), as a mobile phase and UV detection (365 nm).Limit of detection was defined as the amount of flavonoids resulting in a peakheight of 3 times higher than the standard deviation of the baseline noise. Peakidentification was confirmed with the use of known retention time of pure flavonoids.Quantification of the flavonoids was done by peak area measurement. Calibration curvesof individual flavonoids were made over a range of 520 µg ml1. Detector responsewas linear over the concentration range used. For all standards r2 was higher than 0.998.2. Results and discussionTables 14 report the flavonoid content of the fresh vegetables (mg kg1).Quercetin and kaempferol are proved to be the most widespread flavonoids invegetables. Our present results are similar to HERTOG and co-workers observations(1992b) but there are some minor differences in relation of the quality and quantity ofthe compounds, as well. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables weregenerally below 10 mg kg1. The highest quercetin concentration could be detected inspinach (272.2 mg kg1) and in the different types of onion (67.1171.3 mg kg1).HERTOG and co-workers (1992b) could not measure any quercetin in spinach. HighActa Alimentaria 29, 2000348 LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODSquercetin level was also found in dill (74.5 mg kg1), crisped lettuce (35.0 mg kg1),and broccoli (15.4 mg kg1). Very low level or no quercetin was detected in differentroot vegetables such as celery and beet root, radishes and also in Brassica vegetablesexcept broccoli.Significant amount of kaempferol was observed in parsnip (66.4 mg kg1), leek(45.8 mg kg1), fresh onion collected in early summer (34.3 mg kg1), and broccoli(30.8 mg kg1). Average level of flavonoid could be detected in other Brassica and rootvegetables. Practically there was no kaempferol in leafy vegetables except crispedlettuce (8.4 mg kg1). In the study of HERTOG and co-workers (1992b) kaempferol wasfound in kale (211 mg kg1), endive (46 mg kg1), leek (30 mg kg1), and turnip tops(48 mg kg1). In some other vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, French been, radishand broad bean very little low levels were published. Authors mentioned above couldnot find any kaempferol in onions, cauliflower, white cabbage, tomato and Swedishturnip while we detected significant amount in these vegetables.The flavonol myricetin was found in only five vegetables, namely Swedish turnip(85.4 mg kg1), parsley leaves (80.8 mg kg1), celery leaves (43.4 mg kg1), lettuce(10.1 mg kg1), and dill (7.0 mg kg1). Regrettable the leaves of parsley, celery and dillare consumed as a condiment in special Hungarian dishes, therefore, the participation ofthese vegetables in the flavonoid intake of the population is probably negligible. Basedon HERTOGs observation (1992b) only fresh broad bean can be considered as a naturalsource of myricetin, but its concentration is low (26 mg kg1).Table 1Flavonoid concenta of leafy vegetablesSample Quercetin Kaempferol Myricetin Luteolin Apigenin TotalflavonoidsLettuce 16.3 ndb 10.2 nd nd 26.5Crisped lettuce 35.0 8.4 nd 3.9 nd 47.3Ice lettuce 13.5 nd nd nd nd 13.5Spinach 272.2 nd nd 66.4 nd 338.6Parsley leaves nd nd 80.8 nd nd 80.8Celery leaves nd nd 43.4 111.4 nd 154.8Dill 74.5 nd 7.0 nd nd 81.5a Mean (mg kg1 of fresh edible part) of duplicate determination.b Below the detection limit.Acta Alimentaria 29, 2000LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODS 349Table 2Flavonoid contenta of root vegetablesSample Quercetin Kaempferol Myricetin Luteolin Apigenin TotalflavonoidsPurple radish ndb 10.5 nd nd nd 10.5Black radish nd 21.1 nd d nd 21.1Horse radish 5.7 25.7 nd 9.0 nd 31.4Red beet 6.7 nd nd 18.3 nd 25.0Carrot 3.5 nd nd nd nd 3.5Parsnip 9.9 nd nd nd nd 9.9Celery root 1.8 nd nd nd 24.1 25.9Swedish turnip 3.2 22.7 85.4 nd 154.0 265.3a Mean (mg kg1 of fresh edible part) of duplicate determination.b Below the detection limit.Table 3Flavonoid contenta of Brassica vegetablesSample Quercetin Kaempferol Myricetin Luteolin Apigenin TotalflavonoidsCauliflower 1.5 12.5 ndb 4.0 nd 18.0Broccoli 15.4 30.8 nd nd nd 46.2Kohlrabi 4.0 24.3 nd 13.0 nd 41.3Brussel sprouts nd 12.8 nd 6.7 nd 19.5Kale nd 4.8 nd nd nd 4.8Chinese cabbage nd 7.3 nd nd nd 7.3White cabbage 1.6 11.9 nd 4.2 nd 17.7Red cabbage 9.2 nd nd 6.3 nd 15.5a Mean (mg kg1 of fresh edible part) of duplicate determination.b Below the detection limit.Significant amount of flavon luteolin could be detected in celery leaves(111.4 mg kg1), spinach (66.4 mg kg1), red beet (18.3 mg kg1), kohlrabi(13.0 mg kg1), and different types of sweet pepper (10.711.3 mg kg1). HERTOG andco-workers (1992b) could find luteolin only in red bell pepper (11 mg kg1).Acta Alimentaria 29, 2000350 LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODSTable 4Flavonoid contenta of onions, sweet peppers and other vegetablesSample Quercetin Kaempferol Myricetin Luteolin Apigenin TotalflavonoidsOnion (old) 121.5 2.6 ndb nd nd 124.1Onion (young) 67.1 34.5 nd nd nd 101.6Red onion 171.3 24.3 nd nd nd 195.6Leek 5.0 45.8 nd nd nd 50.8Sweet pepper 9.4 nd nd 10.7 nd 20.1Californian pepper 5.1 nd nd 11.3 nd 16.4Tomato 2.7 8.4 nd nd nd 11.1Cucumber 2.4 3.3 nd nd nd 5.7a Mean (mg kg1 of fresh edible part) of duplicate determination.b Below the detection limit.Apigenin was detected in celery leaves (248.0 mg kg1), Swedish turnip(154.0 mg kg1), and celery root (24.1 mg kg1). HERTOG and colleagues (1992b)reported apigenin only in celery (108 mg kg1). In a Danish survey in celery leavesapigenin (740 mg kg1) and luteolin (200 mg kg1) were found, and in parsley apigenin(1850 mg kg1) was detected (LETH& JUSTESEN, 1998).In the present investigation all vegetables had significant amount of flavonolsand/or flavones. The best sources of selected five flavonoids were spinach(338.6 mg kg1), Swedish turnip (265.3 mg kg1), red, young and old onions (195.6,124.1, and 101.6 mg kg1, respectively), and celery leaves (154.8 mg kg1). As theformation of flavonoids is light dependent, flavonoids occur predominantly in theleaves. In contrast, the concentration of flavonoids is low (<1 mg kg1 fresh weight) inroots or tubercules; but in some cases these compounds may accumulate in theunderground parts of certain plants such as onions and radishes. No vegetables werefound free from flavonoids. Opposite of our observations, HERTOG and co-workers(1992b) could not detect any of the flavonoids in spinach, red beet, cucumber, carrotand some of Brassicca vegetables such as sauerkraut, white cabbage, Swedish turnip,and green cabbage. In general, our values are somewhat higher than those reportedearlier by HERMANN (1976) and by HERTOG and co-workers (1992b). Thesediscrepancies may be due to different cultivars, varietal and seasonal differences.Acta Alimentaria 29, 2000LUGASI & HÓVÁRI: FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN PLANT FOODS 3513. ConclusionThe large group of plant polyphenols attracts major interest because of theirpotential anticarcinogenic and other beneficial properties, presumably based on theirfunction as natural antioxidants. Otherwise the flavonoids are compounds of particularinterest because of their high prevalence in foodstuffs. Our investigation proves thepresence of singificant amount of different flavonoids in selected vegetables frequentlyconsumed in Hungary. These investigations are a part of our study on a nationaldatabase of flavonoids in foodstuffs and help to discover the main sources of flavonoidsand the estimation of average daily intake of quercetin, myricetin, luteolin, apigenin, andkaempferol in different groups in the Hungarian population.*This study was supported by the Ministry of Welfare (ETT 052/1996), Hungary. The support wasinitially given to Prof. E. DWORSCHÁK who unexpectedly deceased during this research. This work wasperformed in his unforgettable memory.ReferencesBRAVO, L.
