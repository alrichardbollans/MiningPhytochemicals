Abstract-In addition to phebalosin and ramosin, the air-dried stem and root barks of Galipea trifololiata contain a third 
previously unreported coumarin identified as 7-isopentenyloxy-8-(trai~s-1’,2’-epoxy-~-methyl-3’-butenyl~oumarin. 
INTRODUCTION 
In our continuing phytochemical studies of Rutaceae, we 
report here coumarins from stem and root barks of 
Galipea trifoliata. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSTION 
The petrol extracts of the root bark and of the stem 
bark from Galipea trifoliata, on chromatographic separ- 
ation, each afforded, three coumarins. Two were identified 
as ramosin (7-isopenteryl oxy-8-isopenterylcoumarin) [ 11 
and phebalosin 7-methoxy-8-(trans-1’,2’-epoxy-3’- 
methyl-3’-butenylcoumarin) [2]. The third (l), a new 
natural compound, was isolated as colourless prisms from 
acetone. 
The UV spectrum of 1 in methanol exhibited’maxima at  
223, 246, 257, 312 (sh) and 324nm. There was no 
bathochromic shift on addition with sodium hydroxide. 
The IR spectrum afforded strong peaks at 1740, 1710, 
1605 and 1220 cm-’. This suggested that 1 was a non- 
phenolic and 7-O-substituted coumarin [3]. 
In the ‘H NMR spectrum, a pair of doublets a t  66.18 
and 7.62 (each lH,  d, J = 10 Hz) was characteristic of H-3 
and H-4 in the coumarin nucleus. Two ortho-coupled 
aromatic protons at 67.29 and 6.85 (each lH ,  d, J = 9 Hz) 
were attributed to H-5 and H-6 in the aromatic nucleus. A 
7-isopentenyloxy group was revealed by two methyl 
singlets a t  6 1.76 and 1.78, a doublet a t  64.62 for methylene 
protons and a multiplet a t  65.44 for an olefinic proton. An 
8-isoprenoid side chain was characterized by a vinylic 
methyl group at 61.86 and two multiplets a t  65.02 and 
5.26 corresponding to the presence of CLCH, as in 
phebalosin. An AB quartet centred at 63.93 ( lH,  d, J 
= Hz), 3.97 (lH, d, J = 2 Hz) revealed the presence of the 
epoxide oxymethine protons, the vicinal coupling con- 
stant of 2 Hz indicating a trans configuration [4]. 
The UV, IR and ‘H NMR spectra suggested that 1 was 
7-isopentenyloxy-8-(trans- 1’,2’-epoxy-3’-methy1-3’- 
butenyl) coumarin for which we propose the name of 
galipein. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials. Stem bark and root bark of Galipea trifoliata Aublet 
(voucher samples. No. 47, are deposited at the Herbarium of 
O.R.S.T.O.M. Center of Cayenne in French Guyana) collected 
near Säul (French Guyana). were sliced, then air-dried and 
powdered. 
Centrifugal thin layer chromatographic (CTLC) separations 
were carried out using a Chromatotron from Harrison 
Research. All mps are uncorr. ‘HNMR were measured at 
90 MHz in CDCI, using TMS as int. standard. EIMS were 
recorded at 70 eV. 
Extraction, isolation and purìjication. The air-dried powdered 
material were separately stirred at room temp. with petrol 
(68-80”). Filtration, followed by removal of petrol, gave a residue 
which was chromatographed on a silica gel column using hexane 
containing increasing amounts of EtOAC. The coumarins col- 
lected were isolated and purified by CTLC on silicagel with 
hexane-EtOAC as eluent (9/1 to 7/3).
