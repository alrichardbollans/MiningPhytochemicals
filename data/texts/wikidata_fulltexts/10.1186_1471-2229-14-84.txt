Induced transcriptional profiling of
phenylpropanoid pathway genes increased
flavonoid and lignin content in Arabidopsis leaves
in response to microbial products
Mohammad Babar Ali* and David H McNear Jr
Abstract
Background: The production and use of biologically derived soil additives is one of the fastest growing sectors of
the fertilizer industry. These products have been shown to improve crop yields while at the same time reducing
fertilizer inputs to and nutrient loss from cropland. The mechanisms driving the changes in primary productivity
and soil processes are poorly understood and little is known about changes in secondary productivity associated
with the use of microbial products. Here we investigate secondary metabolic responses to a biologically derived
soil additive by monitoring changes in the phenlypropanoid (PP) pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Results: This study was designed to test the influence of one of these products (Soil Builder™-AF, SB) on secondary
metabolism after being applied at different times. One time (TI) application of SB to Arabidopsis increased the
accumulation of flavonoids compared to multiple (TII) applications of the same products. Fourteen phenolic
compounds including flavonols and anothocyanins were identified by mass spectrometry. Kaempferol-3,7-O-bis-α-
L-rhamnoside and quercetin 3,7-dirhamnoside, the major compounds, increased 3-fold and 4-fold, respectively
compared to control in the TI treatment. The most abundant anthocyanin was cyanidin 3-rhamnoglucoside, which
increased 3-fold and 2-fold in TI compared to the control and TII, respectively. Simultaneously, the expression of
genes coding for key enzymes in the PP pathway (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, chalcone
synthase, flavonoid-3′-O-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase1 and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase) and regulatory genes
(production of anthocyanin pigment2, MYB12, MYB113, MYB114, EGL3, and TT8) were up-regulated in both treatments
(TI and TII). Furthermore, application of TI and TII induced expression of the lignin pathway genes (hydroxyl cinamyl
transferase, caffeyl-CoA O-methyl transferase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, cinnamyl-CoA reductase, secondary
wall-associated NAC domain protein1, MYB58 and MYB63 resulting in higher accumulation of lignin content compared
to the control.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the additions of microbially based soil additives have a perceptible influence
on phenylpropanoid pathway gene regulation and its production of secondary metabolites. These findings open an
avenue of research to investigate the mode of action of microbially-based soil additives which may assist in the
sustainable production of food, feed, fuel and fiber.

Background
One of major challenges in the 21st century is the sus-
tainable production of food, fuel and fiber crops with en-
hanced functional and nutritive value (e.g. flavonoids
and anthocyanins) to meet the demands of an ever-
increasing global population [1,2]. To meet this demand
requires the development of alternative more sustainable
methods for the production and enhancement of value
added agricultural commodities in a way that will have
minimal impact on the ecosystem. Current agricultural
practices are largely based on the use of chemical fertil-
izers and synthetic pesticides for improved crop growth
and yield. However, our dependence and overuse of these
fertilizers has resulted in contamination of soil, ground and
surface waters. Increasing demand for healthier and more
nutrient-dense foods by more health-conscious consumers
and an improved environmental awareness has resulted in
an increased interest in and a rapid change towards eco-
friendly sustainable agricultural farming systems.
One component of this new sustainable production
system is the use of microbe-based fertilizers (i.e. biosti-
mulants) containing potential beneficial strains of micro-
organism and their metabolites many of which have an
important role in conditioning the rhizosphere for im-
proved plant growth and nutrient use efficiency [3,4].
Since the 1970’s we have been cognizant of the potential
benefits on plant growth of specialized plant growth pro-
moting rhizobacteria (PGPR) [5]. There have been many
reports on improvements in plant defense, health and
growth, resistance to pathogens, enhanced salt tolerance,
and improved nutrient uptake in response to PGPR [6,7]
that could have led to the development of novel agricul-
tural applications. In spite of all these advantages, the
use of microbial-based products has not been effectively
exploited at larger scales to improve plant yields and most
certainly not as a means to selectively enhance gene ex-
pression and production of beneficial secondary metabo-
lite in crops.
Phenylpropanoids are a large group of polyphenolic
compounds that comprise an important class of second-
ary metabolites such as flavonoids, anthocyanin and lig-
nin in plants [8]. Phenylpropanoids have important
functions in flower coloration, pollinator attraction, pro-
tection from ultraviolet (UV) light, as signaling mole-
cules between plants and microbes, and as antioxidants
[9]. Additionally, when consumed by humans phenylpro-
panoids offer a myriad of health benefits [10,11]. There
have been many studies on the biosynthesis of flavonols
and the PP pathway in general via metabolic engineering
targeting important agronomic traits such as the produc-
tion of novel colors and color patterns in ornamentals
[8,12]. Many phenylpropanoids act as inducers of plant-
microbe symbioses [13], whereas others exhibit broad-
spectrum antimicrobial activity and are therefore believed
to help plants fight microbial diseases [14]. In addition,
several studies have examined how the PP and defense re-
lated pathways are regulated by interactions between soil
microorganisms and plant roots [15-18]. The genes in-
volved in PP pathway such as chalcone synthase (CHS),
chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H),
flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase (F3’H), and flavonol synthase1
(FLS1) play important roles in the production of secon-
dary metabolites, while dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR),
and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) are involved
in the production of colored anthocyanidins (Additional
file 1). After production, these products are further mo-
dified by glycosylation, acylation, and methylation in a
complex process that changes their stability, solubility, or
localization, and thereby the biological properties of the
conjugated molecules [19].
The transcription factors regulating the expression of
these structural genes have been well characterized in
plant species including Arabidopsis [20]. MYB11, MYB12,
and MYB111 encode three functionally redundant MYBs
regulating the expression of several ‘early’ flavonoid bio-
synthetic genes [21]. On the other hand, TFs such as PAP1,
PAP2, GL3, TT8 and TTG1 which are components of the
MYB/bHLH/WDR (MBW) transcriptional complexes medi-
ate the ‘late’ anthocyanin biosynthesis genes [21,22]. The
lignin biosynthesis pathway is well-characterized and plays
an important role in plant growth, development, increase
cell wall integrity, facilitating water transport and providing
resistance against pathogen [23-25]. The genes which are
involved in lignin biosynthesis are largely regulated at the
transcription level and lignin-specific transcription factor
MYB58, MYB63 and SND1 can induce the biosynthetic
pathways for the synthesis of lignin [26,27].
To date there is little research aimed at understanding
the influence of microbial products on plant secondary
metabolism making it difficult to assess a potential func-
tional relationship(s). Understanding how phenylpropa-
noid metabolism changes in response to microbes or
microbial-based products will help to improve our funda-
mental understanding of plant biology, and would be useful
for the development of natural products aimed at improv-
ing crop yield and quality. Preliminary analysis of the prod-
uct composition shows that it is composed of PGPR related
bacteria and use of the product can result in plant growth
promotion [28,29]. We hypothesized that microbial-based
products, known to improve plant growth and nutrient
uptake, can induce the PP pathway and lignin pathway
in Arabidopsis. Therefore, this study was designed to
evaluate how application and the timing of application
(single and multiple times) influence the PP pathway in
Arabidopsis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
used in this study for transcriptional profiling of flavonoid
and lignin pathway genes, and high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-

electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass
spectrometry (LC/ESI-Q-TOFMS/MS) were used to
determine flavonoid content. The results show that
application of microbial products induced the PP path-
way and there was a different response dependent on
application timing. In both cases application of the
microbial product induced flavonoid and lignin con-
tent in Arabidopsis leaves compared to an untreated
control.
Results
Metabolite composition
Fourteen flavonoids were identified by HPLC-QTOF-
MS/MS analysis in the leaves of Arabidopsis (Figures 1
and 2), including nine flavonols: kaempferol-3,7-O-
bis-alpha-L-rhamnoside (F1), kaempferol-3-O-alpha-
L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside-7-O-alpha-
L-rhamnopyranoside (F2), kaempferol with rhamnoside
(F3), kaempferol with rhamnoside (F4), kaempferol with
rhamnoside (F5), kaempferol in hydrolyzed form (F6),
quercetin 3,7-dirhamnoside (F7), apigenin7-(2”,3”-dia-
cetylglucoside), (F8), and pentamethoxydihydroxy fla-
vone (F9); as well as five representative anthocyanidins
(cyanidin 3-rhamnoglucoside (A1), (cyanidin 3-(6-ma-
lonylglucoside)-7,3”-di-(6-feruloylglucoside) (A2), cyanidin
3-(6”-caffeyl-2”-sinapylsambubioside)-5-(6-malonylglucoside)
(A3), and two isomers of cyanidin 3-(2G-glucosylrutinoside)
(A4 and A5) (Table 1). The majority of Arabidopsis fla-
vonoids were found to be anthocyanins, glycosylated
kaempferol and rhamnosylated in this study which
concurs with previously published findings [30-33].
Significant changes in the biosynthesis of flavonoids
occurred that depended on treatment and time of appli-
cation, except for F8 (Figures 1 and 2). One time ap-
plication of products (TI) induced the peak area of F1,
F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, and F9, compared to control
(Figure 1). Similarly, but to a lesser extent, peak area
levels of F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F7, F8 and F9 were increased
in the TII treatments compared to control (Figure 1).
When compared between TI and TII treatments, TI
treatments increased the peak area of F1, F2, F3, F4, F5,
F6, F7, F8, and F9 compared to TII. The compound
kaempferol, F6, which was detected at Rt11.43 (F6; m/z,
286.04) in the hydrolyzed leafy extracts, was induced sig-
nificantly in the TI treatments compared to control and
TII. The peak area of apigenin (a flavones containing
compound, F8), did not change with the treatments, but
F9 increased significantly in both TI and TII treated
plants, while no significant difference was found in the
peak area level of F9 between the treatments. The five
anthocyanin derivatives (A1-A5) were increased in both
TI and TII treated plants compared to control (Figure 2).
TI induced the level of A2 and A4 significantly com-
pared to TII and control (Figure 2). Comparing TI and

treatment increased the level of A3 compared to TI.
Expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in
Arabidopsis leaves
To understand the influence of microbial product applica-
tion timing (TI and TII) on the flavonoid pathway, the ex-
pression of genes encoding key PP pathway enzymes PAL1,
PAL2, PAL3, PAL4, C4H, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3’H, FLS1, DFR,
LDOX, and UF3GT were analyzed in Arabidopsis leaves
using qPCR (Figures 3 and 4). Both types of treatments (TI
and TII) did not induce the expression PAL1, PAL2, PAL3
and PAL4 significantly (P ≥ 0.05) compared to control
(Figure 3). Expression of CHS, FLS1, LDOX, and UF3GT
was induced double in both types of treatments com-
pared to the control, while TI and TII treatments in-
creased expression of F3’H 8 and 4 times more compared
to control, respectively (Figure 4). Expression of CHI in-
creased significantly (P≤ 0.05) in TI compared to control
and TII treated plants, while CHI expression did not
change significantly in TII treated plants compared to the
control. Expression of F3H increased significantly (P≤
0.05) in TII compared to control and TI treated plants,
while F3H expression did not change significantly in TI
treated plants compared to the control. TI treatment
increased expression of DFR by one fold compared
control and no change of DFR expression was found in
TII treated plants compared to control. Acylation genes
(At1g03495, At1g03940 and At3g29590), glycosylation
genes (UGT75C1 and UGT78D3), GST and UDP-rhamnose
synthase genes (RHM1, RHM2, and RHM3) increased in
the TI and TII treated plants compared to control in the
majority of the cases (see Additional files 2A, B and C).
Expression pattern of flavonoid pathway regulatory
genes in Arabidopsis leaves
To examine whether the induced expression of flavonoid
biosynthetic genes in leaves was accompanied by the ex-
pression of regulatory genes, we analyzed the transcript
levels of PAP1, PAP2, MYB11, MYB12, MYB111, MYB113,
MYB114, GL3, EGL3, TT8 and TTG1 in the leaves of
Arabidopsis treated with TI and TII (Figure 5). Expres-
sion of most of the regulatory genes was induced in
both TI and TII treated plants compared to control. Ex-
pression levels of PAP1 and PAP2 were increased in both
TI and TII treated plants compared to the control; and
even more so for PAP2 in the TI treated plants, which ex-
perienced a 3-fold increase. Expression of MYB11, MYB12,
MYB113 and MYB114 were increased in both TI and TII
treated plants compared to control. Expression of MYB12
and MYB114 was induced to the greatest extent in the TI
compared to TII treated plants. Expression of MYB11 and
MYB113 was induced in both TI and TII treated plants
compared to control. Conversely, MYB111 expression in
the TII treatment was suppressed, and the TI treatment
only slightly up-regulated. The effect of treatment on GL3
and TTG1 expression levels was similar with no induction

increased significantly (P≤ 0.05) compared to TI and con-
trol. Expression of EGL3 did not change in both TI and TII
treated plants compared to control. Strong increase in the
expression levels of TT8 was noted in the TI treated plants
compared to control.
Lignin biosynthesis
To further understand the application of microbial treat-
ments (TI and TII), we analyzed the expression of all the
genes (20) involved in the lignifications pathway (Figures 3,
6, 7 and Additional file 3). The accumulation of transcripts
for C4H, 4CL1, C3’H1, CCoAOMT1, CCR1, CCR2,
COMT1, CAD1, CAD3, CAD4, CAD5, CAD7, CAD8 and
SAT were induced significantly (P ≤ 0.05) in TI treated
plants compared to control. Expression levels of HCT,
F5H1, and SAT were increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) in
TII treated plants compared to control. No significant
(P ≥ 0.05) difference of expression levels of C3’H1, CCR1,
CCR2, and COMT1 were observed between control and
TII treated plants. We found that expression levels of
CCR2, CAD1, CAD5, CAD7, and CAD8 were increased
significantly (P≤ 0.05) in TI compared to TII treated
plants. Expression of LAC4, LAC17, and their regulatory
genes (SND1, MYB58, and MYB63) increased significantly
(P≤ 0.05) in both TI and TII treated plants compared to
control (Additional file 4), and also with significant (P ≤
0.05) expression levels for the TI compared to the TII
treated plants. Significant (P≤ 0.05) accumulation of lig-
nin was noted in the TI and TII treated plants compared
to control.
Discussion
Expression of flavonoid pathway genes and
metabolite composition
Our study provides evidence that application of microbial
products (TI and TII) to Arabidopsis plants increases the
accumulation of flavonoids, and that TI resulted in greater
accumulation of metabolites than TII treated plants. Such
enhancement was accompanied by an increased expres-
sion of most of the genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic
pathway. This was particularly prominent in TI treated
plants, but there were also elevated expression levels in
TII treated plants. Synthesis of the derivatives of kaemp-
ferol, quercetin, and anthocyanins depend greatly on dihy-
drokaempferol. Meanwhile, F3’H and FLS1 are crucial
to channeling the precursor’s dihydroquercetin/dihydro-
kaempferol, forming quercetin or kaempferol branches.
The up-regulation of F3’H and FLS1 in TI compared with
TII treated plants are consistent with an increase in the
amounts of most of flavonol glycosides in Arabidopsis
leaves (Figure 1). However, in TII treated plants, there was
a significant decrease in the amounts of most of flavonol
glycosides compared to TI, which is also in accordance

with the down-regulation of F3’H and FLS1 observed in TII
treated plants. Such difference may be due to the variability
of specific substrate, which can make the biosynthetic path-
way different, thus producing different products. Therefore,
the increase of kaempferol-containing flavonols is primarily
associated with the accumulation of F1, which is 2-fold
higher as compared to F2, F3, F4, F5, F7, and F9 in TI
treated plants.
LC-MSMS analyses detected a strongly increased level of
a compound (F6) in acid hydrolyzed samples correspond-
ing to molecular mass (m/z, 286.0) of aglycone kaempferol.
Consistent with the induced expression of DFR, LDOX and
UF3GT in both TI and TII treated plants, we observed sig-
nificant increases in the amount of anthocyanins (A1, A2,
A3, A4 and A5) in the leaves of Arabidopsis as compared
to the control (Figure 2). The effect was most prominent
for A1, A2, A4 and A5 in the TI treated plants wherewith
higher accumulation was observed compared to those
plants receiving the TII treatment. In contrast, plants
treated with TII showed higher accumulation of A3
compared to control. The presence of caffeyl, ferulyl, sina-
pyl and malonyl groups in the accumulated anthocyanins
is parallel with the induced expression of anthocyanin acyl-
transferases, and SAT in the present study [34]. The accu-
mulation of these compounds could provide some level of
increased defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. For
example, the presence of the acylated flavonol glycosides in
the leaf hairs of Quercus ilex increased the plant’s pro-
tection against the damage of UV-B radiation [35]. In
another example, rutin showed significant antifungal
activity against the fungi Cylindrocar pondestructans,
Phytophthora megasperma, and Verticillium dahlia attac-
king olive trees (Olea europaea). Rutin is, therefore, be-
lieved to play a major role in plant defense [36]. The
formation of a large number of glycoslated kaepmferol
derivatives and only a small amount of glycosylated
anthocyanidins in our study are corroborated by earlier
reports [37,38].

Several GTs that are involved in the glycosylation pro-
cesses and induced expression of UGT75C1 and UGT78D3
[30,38] are consistent with the expression of FLS1, F3’H,
and glycosylated flavonol compound biosynthesis in TI and
TII treated plants. Rhamnosylation is a major glycosylation
process of flavonols and the genes responsible for bio-
synthesis of rhmanose sugar, and is vital in supplying
UDP-rhamnose for flavonol biosynthesis. Enhanced ex-
pression of RHM1, RHM2 and RHM3 in the TI and TII
treated plants suggests their possible roles in the formation
of Rha residue and rhamnosylation of flavonoids. Our LC-
MSMS data also suggest that most flavonol accumulation
in the microbial treated plants is in the rhamnosylated
form. Induced expression of rhamnosylated genes was re-
ported in Arabidopsis [31], confirming previous results that
suggest its involvement in rhamnosylation of flavonols
in TI and TII treated plants. The induced expression of
RHM1, RHM2, and RHM3 in our study may be due to
either competition of substrate availability, or to changes
in the flow of flux in the different branches of the PP
pathway, a phenomenon which has been reported in
Arabidopsis [39,40]. These results showed significant
variation in flavonoid accumulation, indicating that the
accumulation of flavonoid may potentially be manipu-
lated by altering the application timing of the microbial
based products.
Transcriptional regulation of flavonoid pathway genes
Transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis struc-
tural genes are controlled by regulatory genes, which pro-
vide an additional level of control. Several MYB/bHLH/
WD-repeat (MBW) family genes have been implicated in
the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
Among them, PAP1 is a master regulator of flavonoid/
anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway [41]. Our results sug-
gest that induced expression of PAP1 and its close homo-
log, PAP2, are strongly induced in TI and TII treated
plants, regulating the flavonoid biosynthesis. Interestingly,

PAP2 expression was increased in TI treated plants as
compared to PAP1. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that
PAP2 expression was stable enough to control flavonoid
biosynthesis.
There are several other genes encoding MYB and bHLH
transcription factors (TF) that are known to be involved in
regulating flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis leaves.
Therefore, the expression of MYB11, MYB12, MYB111,
MYB113, MYB114, GL3, EGL3, TT8 and TTG1 was ana-
lyzed. TT8 interacts with PAP1/PAP2 [42], and the up-
regulation of PAP1/PAP2 and TT8 genes appears to be
required for the activation of anthocyanin structural genes
for anthocyanin production in TI treated plants. The closely
related MYB11, MYB12, and MYB111 TFs are flavonol-
specific regulators, and effect flavonol accumulation in dif-
ferent parts of the Arabidopsis seedlings by regulating
several genes of flavonoid biosynthesis, such as CHS, CHI,
F3’H, and FLS1 [21]. Consistent with the up-regulation of
PAP1 and PAP2, induced expression of MYB11, MYB12,
MYB113 and MYB114 genes resulted in an increase in the
content of individual flavonol biosynthesis in the TI com-
pared TII treated plants. However, induced expression of
PAP1, MYB11 and MYB113 gene coincided with reduced
expression of PAP2, MYB12, MYB111 and MYB114 in the
TII treated plants, suggesting a balance among MYB gene
members in controlling the flavonoid biosynthesis in our
study. Variable regulation of the TFs and regulatory genes
in the TII treated plants likely led to the lower amounts of
flavonols and anothcyanin and higher amounts of F8, F9
and A3 observed in these plants.
Interestingly, a significant increase in the amounts of A3
was noted in the TII as compared to TI treated plants that
may have been due to the induced expression of regulatory
genes GL3 and TTG1, and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes
LDOX and UF3GT. Previous studies have indicated that the
mutant of ttg1 disrupted the expression of late anthocyanin
biosynthetic genes such as DFR and LDOX, whereas the
expression of ‘early’ anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (CHS,
CHI, and F3H) is not effected in the same mutant
[22,43,44]. Our results show that genes involved in the
biosynthesis of flavonoids are expressed differently in TI
and TII treated plants, which explains why some of the fla-
vonoids are produced in much higher amounts as com-
pared to the control. This clearly indicates some correlation
between the biosynthesis of these closely related flavonoids
in response to plants receiving the microbe-based soil ad-
ditive. However, further work is required to understand
whether these changes are due to the microbes or metabo-
lites in the product, or the interaction of the two, and if
they are acting directly on the plant or indirectly by mediat-
ing the interaction of the plant with the surrounding soil.
Expression of transcription factors during lignin
accumulation
A branch of the PP pathway is responsible for the synthesis
of lignins by the coordinated transcription of lignin path-
way genes (C4H, 4CL1, C3’H1, CCoAOMT1, CCR1, CCR2,
COMT1, CAD1, CAD3, CAD5, CAD7, CAD8 and SAT)
[45-49]. TI strongly induced the expression of C4H, 4CL1,
HCT, C3’H1, CCoAOMT1, CCR1, CCR2, COMT1, CAD1,
CAD3, CAD5, CAD7, CAD8 and SAT, whereas TII induc-
tion of lignin biosynthesis genes is relatively low, with the
exception of HCT and F5H1, whose expression levels were
higher in the TII compared to TI treated plants (Figure 6
and Additional file 3). C4H, 4CL1, and HCT have been
shown to be involved in lignification [50-52]; furthermore,
the increase in the expression levels of C4H, 4CL1, and
HCT in the TI and TII treated plant could be linked to the
lignification process. CCoAOMT1 and COMT1 expression
was induced in TI and TII treated plants. CCoAOMT1 en-
codes an enzyme involved in monolignol biosynthesis by
catalyzing the methylation of caffeyl-CoA ester. Moreover,
in TI treated plants, the up-regulation CCoAOMT1 and
COMT1 were observed more than those of TII treated
plants. Overexpression of PAP1 (a positive regulator of
anthocyanin biosynthesis) in Arabidopsis showed increased
amounts of guaiacyl and syringyl monomers that were
associated with increased lignin accumulation [24]. In Vitis
vinifera, VvMYB5a, which regulates anthocyanin and
proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in grapevine, also affects lig-
nin biosynthesis. Overexpression of VvMYB5a in tobacco
down regulated CCoAOMT1 gene expression, leading to
reduced lignification in anther walls and delayed dehiscence
[53]. It was also observed that C4H and COMT1 genes are
regulated by a lignin-specific MYB transcription factor
MYB58 in Arabidopsis [54,55].

Of the two CCR isogenes, CCR1 showed higher over-
all expression levels than CCR2 in both TI and TII
treated plants, but only plants form TI had greater
CCR1 expression compared to control. Up-regulation
of CCR expression has been associated with an increase
in lignin formation in Arabidopsis [56]. Nine CAD
genes have been reported in Arabidopsis [48]. The re-
sults showed that six members of the CAD family genes
(CAD1, CAD3, CAD4, CAD5, CAD7, and CAD8) accu-
mulated at varying levels, with CAD1, CAD3, CAD7
and CAD8 expression being higher in the TI treated
plants compared to TII treated plants (Additional file 3).
CAD4 and CAD5 have been shown to play a major role
in lignifications [57]. We observed that CAD4 and
CAD5 expression was induced to the same degree in
both TI and TII treated plants compared to control. A
role of CAD1 in lignification has been shown in young
stems, flowers, and siliques of Arabidopsis [58]. CAD3
expression was detected in secondary growth in hy-
pocotyls of A. thaliana [59]. A several fold increase in
the levels of expression of CAD7 and CAD8 was noted
in the TI treated plants compared to TII treated plants;
however, their expression was increased in the TII
treated plants compared to control plants. The higher
induced expression levels of CAD7 compared to CAD8
was also observed in plantlets and flowers of Arabidopsis
[58]. Thus, different members of the CCR and CAD
family genes appear to be induced differently in lignin
biosynthesis in plants treated with microbe-derived
products. The induced expression of these genes in our
study suggested that they might contribute to the bio-
synthesis of lignin. At2g23000, encoding sinapoylglu-
cose:anthocyanin sinapoyltransferase (SAT), plays a
role in sinapoylmalate synthesis [60] an increase in the
expression levels of SAT in the TI and TII treated plant
was also noted.
Both CCR and CAD are critical for lignin biosynthesis,
transferred into the cell wall, and polymerized by laccases
[61,62]. The up-regulation of laccases (LAC4 and LAC17)
is accompanied by the up-regulation of several TFs in
both TI and TII treated plants responsible for controlling
lignin biosynthesis (Additional file 4). It was shown that
LAC4 is expressed in vascular bundles and interfascicular
fibers; and, that LAC17 contributes in the interfascicular
fibers lignifications [63]. Secondary wall associated NAC
domain protein1 (SND1), a key transcriptional activator
regulating the developmental program of secondary wall
biosynthesis [64], was induced in TI and TII treated plants
compared to control (Additional file 4). MYB58 and
MYB63 have been suggested to be specific activators for
lignin biosynthesis [55]. The induced expression of these
genes in both TI and TII treated plants (Additional file 4)
suggested that they are actively involved in the lignifi-
cations process.
Conclusions
This study shows that microbial products applied to the
soil of growing plants support our hypothesis and results
in induction of the PP pathway and increased metabolite
biosynthesis. The one time application of microbial prod-
ucts (TI) produced more metabolites than multiple appli-
cations (TII). The higher metabolite biosynthesis in TI
compared to TII could be explained by the fact that both
TI and TII contained microbial products, while TII ap-
plied few times more compared to TI may have indirectly
inhibit the metabolite biosynthesis or diverted the metab-
olites to other metabolic pathway. However, overall fla-
vonoid accumulation was higher in the treated plants,
regardless of timing, as compared to the control. Such dif-
ferences in the flavonols and anthocyanin accumulations
between TI and TII treated plants can be explained by the
differential transcript accumulation of structural and regu-
latory genes in leaves of Arabidopsis. This is one of the
first studies to show that microbial products play an im-
portant role in activating the PP pathway in leaves of Ara-
bidopsis. These results suggest that the mechanism(s)
responsible for the enhancement of metabolites could be
related to the microorganisms or metabolites in the prod-
uct, or an interaction of both. Innovative approaches are
needed such as pyro-sequencing for the identification of
specific microbial groups, and metabolomics analysis for
the identification of possible bioactive metabolites within
the product to evaluate those responsible for activation of
the transcriptional cascade observed in this study.
Methods
Source of microbial preparation
Soil Builder™-AF, SB (Advanced Microbial Solutions,
Pilot point, TX, USA), a biochemical fertilizer catalyst
developed specifically for the agriculture industry, con-
tains bacteria products derived from a bioreactor system
consisting of a large and diverse microbial community.
The microbial community composition of SB has been
assessed using 16S rRNA based gene analysis and is gen-
erally composed of species of bacillus, actimomyces and
proteobacteria. Previous works also reported that SB
consists of bacillus species, actinomycetes, cyanobac-
teria, algae, protozoa, and microbial by-products [65]
including microbial metabolites produced during anae-
robic fermentation of a microbial community [66]. Basic
chemical composition of the product was determined by
the University of Kentucky Soil Testing Laboratory follo-
wing standard protocols (Additional file 5).
Growth conditions and treatment procedure
Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 were
sterilized and sown on solid 0.7% agar plates containing
1× Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.7). Plates were
incubated in darkness at 4°C for 2-3 days and were
Ali and McNear BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:84 Page 10 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/84
transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C with a 16-h
light/8-h dark cycle at a photosynthetic photon flux
density (PPFD) of 100 μmol m-2 s-1, and 65-70% relative
humidity and grown for two weeks. After two weeks sev-
enty of the seedlings were transferred to six inch pots
containing fertilizer (PRO-MIX® BX, Quakertown, PA,
USA), arranged in randomized complete block design in
the growth chamber and allowed to acclimate for 7-
10 days. Plants were treated following the manufacturers
recommended application rate of 100 ml of 6× concen-
trated 16 ml/L SB. For TI, individual plants were treated
with the products only on 1st day, and in parallel with
same solutions for 1st day and every 3rd day for TII.
Control plants were treated with same water in every 3rd
day. Each set of treatment have 18-20 plants including
control. On day 14, from each set 5-6 plants were di-
vided randomly to collect representative of biological
replicates (R1, R2 and R3). Leaves were collected on day
14 (control and treated), weighed, and were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Quantitative real-
time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates
using TRI-ZOL method following the manufacturer in-
structions. cDNA synthesis and qPCR analysis was
done according to the method of [67]. Transcript levels in
Arabidopsis were measured in triplicates of each biological
replicate by qPCR, using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystem)
in the Applied Biosystem StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR
Systems following the manufacturer’s manual. The relative
mRNA levels were determined by normalizing the PCR
threshold cycle number of each gene with that of the EF-
1α and ACTIN as reference genes, according to GeneEx
software (http://www.multid.se/order/bioeps.php;) and
the data were the average of three replicates. Se-
quences of primers used in this study were retrieved
from literature and used for amplifying gene-specific
sequences (Additional file 6 [24,25,27,31,48,68-77].
Identification and quantification of flavonoids and
anthocyanins by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS method
Metabolite profiling was performed as described by Lea
et al. (2007) with some modifications. Approximately
100 mg frozen leaves from three biological were homog-
enized under liquid nitrogen and transferred to a 2 mL
Eppendorf tube, to which was added 1 mL of methanol.
The phenolics were extracted for 18 h at room temperature
in darkness, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The
extract was filtered through a sterile Syr filter (25 mm,
0.20 μm) through sterile syringe (MicroLiter Analytical
Supplies, Inc). Acid hydrolysis was performed by adding
30 -μl of 3 N HCL into the sample, and then heated for
an hr at 70°C in water bath. The accuracy of machine
was tested in the extract of samples before running ana-
lyses, and we injected a mix of flavonoids to make sure
flavonoids were working in LC-MSMS method that in-
cluded the following: Apigenin-7-glucoside, liquiriti-
genin, geninstein, quercetin, apigenin, and epicatechin.
Profiling of metabolites (flavonoids and anthocyanins)
in leaf extracts was performed using an LC system with
pump model 1200 with 6530A (Agilent Technologies,
CA, USA) quadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) mass
spectrometer equipped with an Agilent Jet Stream elec-
trospray ionization (ESI) ion source. The ESI source
used a separate nebulizer for the continuous introduc-
tion of reference mass compounds: 121.050873,
922.009798 (positive ion mode). Five microliters of sam-
ple extract was separated using an Acquity BEH Shield
RP-18 analytical column (1.7 μm 2.1×150 mm, Waters
Corporation, Milford, CT) maintained at 40°C. The mo-
bile phase of solvent A consists of water/formic acid
(99.9:0.1, v/v) and (B) acetonitrile/formic acid (99.9:0.1,
v/v) with a solvent ratio of A:B of 95:5. The following
gradient for binary pump 1 was used with a total ana-
lysis time of 21 min and a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min: 5%
to 25% mobile phase B over 2 min then to 25% to 65%
mobile phase B for 2.0 to 10.5 min, then to 99% mobile
phase B for 10.5 to 12.5 min, then held at 99% mobile
phase for 12.5 to 14 min followed by to 5% B from 14 to
15.5 min and then held at 5% 15.5 to 17 min.
The analytical conditions of mass spectrometry are as
follows: range, start (100 amu), stop (1,700 amu), and
scan time (4.0 s); heating gas temperature, 350°C; gas
flow (l/min), 8.0; nebulizing gas, 35 psi; Sheath gas
temp, 350; Sheath gas flow 11.0; VCap 3000; nozzle
voltage (V) 1000. The fragmentor voltage was 120 V
and skimmer1 65 VandoctopoleRFPeak 750 and collision
energies (20 eV) were optimized for each compound. To
confirm the identity of the flavonoids, MS/MS (m/z) frag-
mentation patterns were compared with those of previously
published reports [41] and confirmed by accurate mass
Q-TOF analyses. In the absence of authentic standards,
the flavonoids were quantified by peak area. MSMS
spectra were compared with LC ESI-Q-TOF- MS/MS
spectra of known compounds from the ReSpect data
base containing all flavonoids MS/MS spectra (pub-
lished by Prof Kazuki Saito, JP) and Metlin (the Agilent
MS/MS spectral library). Results are reported as the mean
of the three replicates.
Lignin measurement
Lignin was measured quantitatively according to [78].
Leaves were homogenized in liquid N2. The powdered
was transferred to a tube and suspended in 1.5 ml of
methanol, and vigorously stirred for 1 h. The homogenate
was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, the pellet was
Ali and McNear BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:84 Page 11 of 14

washed with 1.5 ml of the following solvents by vortexing
for 15 min: (i) methanol twice; (ii) 1 M NaCl; (iii) 1% SDS;
(iv) water twice; (v) CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1); and (vi) tert-
butyl methyl ether. The final pellet was freeze-dried over-
night, and 10 mg was taken for the following assay. The
powder was treated with 1 ml of 2 M HCl and 0.2 ml of
thioglycolic acid for 4 h at 95°C. The mixture was cooled
down and centrifuged for 10 min. The pellet was washed
with water three times, and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 M
NaOH and the suspension was shaken vigorously overnight
at 4°C to extract the lignin thioglycolic acid derivatives
(LTGAs), and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was
collected in a fresh tube, and the pellet was mixed with
0.5 ml of 0.5 M NaOH for 1 h. Following centrifugation,
the supernatant was combined with the previous one, and
acidified with 0.3 M concentrated HCl to precipitate
LTGAs at 4°C for 4 h. The mixture was centrifuged, and
the pellet was kept overnight at 4°C. The LTGA pellet
was dissolved in 1.5 ml of 0.M NaOH and the absorption
was measured at 280 nm on a spectrophotometer. Results
are reported as the mean of the three replicates.
