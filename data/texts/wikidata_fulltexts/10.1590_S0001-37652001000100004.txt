ABSTRACT
The essential oil from Piper solmsianum leaves and its major compound (sarisan) were tested to verify
their influences upon mice behaviour. The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified
Clevenger extractor and analysed by GC/ MS. This analysis revealed in the oil the presence of monoterpenes,
sesquiterpenes and of arylpropanoids. The compound sarisan, a myristicin analogue, was isolated from the
oil to perform the pharmacological tests. Emulsions of the oil and of sarisan (5.0 and 10.0% v/v) were used
in the tests. Pentobarbital (30 mg/ kg s.c.) or diazepam (2.5 mg/ kg s.c.) were tested as standard drugs to
verify depressant or anxiolytic effects, respectively. Both essential oil and sarisan showed to have exciting
and depressant effects in the tested animals.
Key words: Piperaceae, Piper solmsianum, essential oil, sarisan, psychopharmacologic effect.
INTRODUCTION
The family Piperaceae comprises about 10 genera
and 1400 species (Yunker 1972). Some of these
species are used in folk medicine to treat many dis-
eases (Duke 1985). Chemical investigation of
Piperaceae essential oils has shown the pres-
ence of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aryl-
propanoids (Bessiere et al. 1994, Jantan et al. 1994;
Martins et al. 1998, Moreira et al. 1997). It has been
frequent the isolation and chemical characterisation
of arylpropanoids (Parmar et al. 1997) from crude
extracts and essential oils of Piperaceae species (saf-

role, myristicin, eugenol, dillapiol, apiol, asarone).
Arylpropanoids and related compounds have shown
interesting biological properties including psy-
chotropic, antimicrobial, antioxidant and cyto-
toxic effects (Shulgin & Sargent 1967, Masuda et
al. 1991, Priyadarsini et al. 1998, Atsumi et al.
2000). Piper solmsianum C.DC. (syn. Piper leu-
cathum C.DC. and P. santosanum C.DC.) is a shrub
measuring 1 to 3 meters high, commonly found in
Southeast Brazil. There are not medicinal uses re-
ported to this species. However Brazilian people
usually employ plants of the family Piperaceae as
a pepper like condiment (Corrêa 1984). This usage
may promote toxicological side effects on humans

since very little is known about the chemistry of
Brazilian Piperaceae.
Phytochemical investigation of P. solmsianum
showed the presence of eupomatenoid-6 in the hex-
ane extract and acaciin in the methanolic extract
among other compounds (Moreira et al. 1995). Pre-
vious essential oil analyses from leaves of P. solm-
sianum (Moreira et al. 1998) revealed the pres-
ence of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and as ma-
jor compound an arylpropanoid derivative (sarisan
- 39.23%). Toxicological effects, including weak
pulse, hypothermia, delirium, vertigo and nausea,
associated to ingestion of about 5-15 g of nutmeg
(Myristica fragrans), rich in the arylpropanoid
derivative myristicin, has been reported (Shulgin
1966, Hallstrom & Thuvander 1997). The structure
similarities of myristicin and of sarisan, the main
constituent of P. solmsianum essential oil, encour-
aged us to perform some pharmacological studies
on mice behaviour.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PlantMaterial and Extraction of the Essen-
tial Oil
P. solmsianum was collected near Teresopolis,
Brazil, in September 1996. The plant was identified
by the botanist Prof. E.F.Guimarães and a botani-
cal sample is found at the Herbarium of the Botan-
ical Garden of Rio de Janeiro (RB 306115), Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Fresh leaves of P. solmsianum (1.5
kg) has undergone hydrodistillation for one hour in a
modified Clevenger extractor, yielding a colourless
oil (10ml) with a pleasant odour. A sample of this
oil was dissolved in dichloromethane for GC and
GC/MS analysis (Moreira et al. 1997).
Isolation of the Main constituent of the Es-
sential Oil
The essential oil (10ml) obtained from leaves of P.
solmsianum was fractionated in a silica gel column
using mixtures of hexane and ethyl acetate as elu-
ent. The 1-allyl-2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy-
benzene (sarisan, 3.0 ml ) and 3-carene (0.02 ml)
were isolated from the volatile mixture (Moreira et
al. 1998).

Analysis of the Essential Oil
GC – It was performed using a Varian Star 3400
CX gas chromatograph, fused silica capillary col-
umn (DB5, 30m x 0.20mm), hydrogen as carrier gas
and temperature programming from 60◦C to 240◦C
(3◦C/ min.).
GC/MS – It was performed using a HP5890 SII gas
chromatograph coupled to a VG Autospect Mass
Spectrometer at 70 eV, fused silica capillary col-
umn (DB-1, 30m x 0.20 mm), helium as carrier gas
and temperature programming from 60◦C to 240◦C
(3◦C/ min). Identification of the substances was car-
ried out by comparison of their retention indices
(RI) with literature values and their mass spectral
data with those from the NBS mass spectral database
(Adams 1995, McLafferty & Stanffer 1989).
Retention Indices – Retention indices (RI) were
calculated using GC data of a homologous series of
saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons within C8 to C22,
performed in the same column and conditions as
used in the GC analysis for the essential oils.
NMR Analysis – It was recorded on a Varian
Gemini (200 MHz – 1H; 50.2 MHz – 13C) – NMR
instrument. The chemical shifts were determined
in CDCl3, using TMS as internal standard. NMR
data of pure compounds were previously published
(Moreira et al. 1998).

PSYCOPHARMACOLOGIC EFFECT OF P. solmsianum ESSENTIAL OIL 35
Pharmacological Tests
Groups of five adult albino mice of both sexes,
weighting about 20 g, were used in each experi-
ment. In the tests with pentobarbital and diazepam,
two groups of the animals were used. Emulsions
(water/ oil) of the essential oil (EO) with 5.0% and
10.0% (v/v) were prepared. In preliminary tests, the
EO was given i.p. 0.5ml/ animal (10.0% emulsion -
sarisan = 20µl) and 0.1ml/ animal (5.0% emulsion-
sarisan = 2µl). For the experiments using pentobar-
bital (30mg/ kg s.c.), the EO was given i.p. 0.1ml/
animal (5.0% emulsion - sarisan = 2µl) 30 min-
utes before the administration of the drug. The
EO was administered (5.0% emulsion - 0.1ml/ an-
imal, - sarisan = 2µl) 30 minutes before diazepam
(2.5mg/ kg s.c.). Sarisan was given i.p. at a dose
of 0.5ml/ animal (5.0% emulsion - real conc. of
sarisan = 25µl/ animal). In the experiments using
sarisan and pentobarbital, three groups of five adult
albino mice each were used. Group A received pen-
tobarbital (30mg/ kg s.c.) 30 minutes after receiving
sarisan (0.1ml/ animal- 5.0% emulsion- real conc.
of sarisan = 25µl/ animal) and Group B 60 minutes
later. Group C received only sarisan in the same
dose as A and B groups. Sarisan concentration in
the essential oils emulsions was estimated in rela-
tion to the percentual ratio given by the GC analysis
(Table I).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A strong sedative effect was observed when the es-
sential oil was given i.p. at dose of 0.5ml/ animal
in 10.0% emulsion (sarisan = 20µl/ animal). Few
minutes after the drug administration it was noted
an exciting behaviour, characterised by fast move-
ments of the animals in the cage. Five minutes later
the animals showed ataxia and 30 minutes after-
ward the animals slept. In approximately 14 hours
(RSD = ±1) all mice died. Mydriasis was ob-
served with no changes in the cardiac and the res-
piratory frequencies during the sleeping time. A
weaker depressant behaviour was noted when the

above dose was reduced ten times (0.1ml/ animal of
a 5.0% emulsion; sarisan = 2µl/ animal). The tested
animals showed ataxia after 5 minutes of drug injec-
tion and death were not observed. This dose of the
essential oil (sarisan equivalent = 2µl/ animal) was
taken to perform the pharmacological tests employ-
ing pentobarbital or diazepam.
After administration of sarisan emulsion
(5.0%) at dose of 0.5ml/ animal (sarisan = 25µl/
animal) it was observed a tail stiffening and pilo-
erection, signals that characterise a medullary exci-
tation. Increase of external stimulation response was
observed during this phase. It was noted a depres-
sant effect 30 minutes later, characterised by ataxia.
The sleeping time promoted by administration

of pentobarbital (30mg/ kg s.c.) 30 minutes later
than essential oil (0.1ml/ animal- 5.0%; sarisan =
2µl/ animal), was increased 60% (RSD = ±5%).
All animals that received pentobarbital (30mg/
kg s.c.) 30 minutes later than sarisan (5µl/ ani-
mal) died due to respiratory depression. However,
only 50% (RSD = ±10%) of the animals died due
to pentobarbital given one hour later than sarisan
at the same concentration. Sarisan increased 70%
(RSD = ±3%) the sleeping time promoted by pen-
tobarbital in the survived animals.
No changes in behaviour was observed when
the animals received diazepam (2.5mg/ kg) and the
essential oil (0.1ml/ animal- 5.0%, sarisan = 2µl/
animal).
These results are in agreement to those psy-
chopharmalogical effects published for myristicin,
an analogue of sarisan (Shulgin 1966, Hallstrom &
Thuvander 1997). It has been demonstrated that
myristicin promotes CNS depressant effect besides
an induction of the cytochrome P-450 system (Hall-
strom & Thuvander 1997). Previous investigation
with eugenol and safrole, arylpropanoid derivatives,
showed that these compounds intervene in the cy-
tochrome P-450 functions (Nagababu & Lakshma-
iah 1994, Janiaud et al. 1997). The exciting action
of the essential oil in SNC was demonstrated by an
increase of the sensitivity induced by external stimu-
lation. This exciting effect was confirmed by admin-
istration of pure sarisan that originated medullary
responses. The depressant effects of the essential
oil and of sarisan was sustained since the sleep-
ing time promoted by co-administration of pento-
barbital was increased 60% and 70%, respectively.
This observed depressant effect may arise from a cy-
tochrome P-450 system induction that contributes to
increase the effects of pentobarbital.
The preliminary psycopharmacological results
obtained for the essential oil from P. solmsianum
leaves and for its major compound sarisan recom-
mend to avoid the use of this plant as a pepper-like
condiment. Since diversified biological effects have
been shown by arylpropanoids, species of Piper-
aceae rich in these compounds should be better in-
vestigated before their usage as condiment or in the
treatment of human diseases.
RESUMO
O óleo essencial das folhas de Piper solmsianum e seu
constituinte majoritário (sarisan) foram testados para ava-
liar suas influências no comportamento de camundongos.
O óleo essencial foi obtido por hidrodestilação em apa-
relho do tipo Clevenger modificado e analisado por CG/
EM. Essa análise mostrou a presença de monoterpenos,
sesquiterpenos e arilpropanóides. Sarisan, um análogo da
myristicina, foi isolado do óleo para se efetuar os testes
farmacológicos. Emulsões do óleo essencial e do sarisan
a 5,0% e 10,0% (v/v) foram utilizadas nos testes. Pento-
barbital (30 mg/ kg s.c.) ou diazepam (2,5 mg/ kg s.c.)
foram testados como padrões na verificação de efeitos de-
pressores e ansiolíticos, respectivamente. O óleo essen-
cial e seu componente majoritário apresentaram efeitos
excitantes e depressores nos animais testados.
