Biosynthesis of the Allylphenols Eugenol and Methyleugenol in 
Ocymum basilicum L.

Summary The allylphenols eugenol and methyleugenol are 
synthesized in 0. basilicum from ferulic acid and coniferyl 
alcohol whose sidechains are converted into allyl groups 
with retention of all carbon atoms, and hydrogen atoms 
of the hydroxy-group are quantitatively incorporated 
into the allyl group; a previous hypothesis for the bio- 
synthesis of these compounds, which involved loss of the 
C-1 from these precursors, has therefore to be rejected. 
ON the basis of comparative phytochemical considerations 
it can be assumed that allyl- and propenyl-phenols in higher 
plants originate from the cinnamate carbon skeleton.’ s2  
The most likely intermediates are substituted cinnamyl 
aldehydes and cinnamyl alcohols. However, recent studies 
on the biosynthesis of eugenol in Ocimum basilicum led 
Canonica et al.3 to reject this possibility. They fed D,L- 
phenylalanine, labelled with l4C in different positions of the 
side chain mixed with non-specifically tritiated L-phenyl- 
alanine and observed in the case of [1-Wlphenylalanine an 
increase in the 3H : 14C ratio of the isolated eugenol. This 
was interpreted as being due to loss of the carboxyl group 
of phenylalanine at  the cinnamate stage. Feeding experi- 
ments with L- we-Wlmethionine showed an incorporation 
of the labelled atom into the allylphenols and it was3~4 
proposed that the terminal carbon atom may be derived 
from this precursor. Biosynthetically prepared U-tritiated 
ferulic acid was also found to be incorporated into the 
allylphenols. The above observations, that eugenol is de- 
rived from L-phenylalanine via oxygenated cinnamic acids 
with loss of the carboxy-group and incorporation of an 
‘extra’ carbon atom into the side-chain, have been recently 
confirmed.’ It is clear, however, that further work is 
required to clarify this situation.s

SCHEME 
We report that the above observations are incorrect in 
that allylphenols are formed from the intact carbon skeleton 
of ring-substituted cinnamic acids and their derivatives, 
as loss of the carboxy-group of ferulic acid, incorporation of 
an ‘extra’ carbon atom, and removal of the hydrogen atoms 
from C-1 of coniferyl alcohol did not occur during the 
biosynthesis of eugenol and methyleugenol. 
A high-eugenol-yielding 0. basilicum strain ‘Genovese’ 
(Ingegnoli, Milan, Italy) was used for these experiments. 
Glucoferulic acid was synthesized by a Knoevenagel reaction 
of [ l-14C]malonic acid with acetylated [O-CH,3H]gluco- 
vanillin.* Thus the labelled ferulic acid unit contained 
14C and 3H within the same molecular species. [14C; 3H]- 
Coniferin was synthesized by standard procedure from the 
above glucoferulic acid. [y-l4C3H,OH]Coniferin was syn-

thesized by reduction of acetylated [y-14COCl]glucoferuloyl 
chloride with LiB3H4.7 Tritium was exclusively located in 
the alcohol group of coniferin, as 53% (calc. 50%) of 
tritium was lost when coniferyl alcohol liberated by the 
action of p-glucosidase from coniferin was enzymatically 
converted into coniferyl aldehyde by means of specific 
cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase [NADP] ;* the same results 
were obtained when [y-l4C3H2OH]coniferin was oxidised 
with MnO, to give the corresponding aldehyde. Gluco- 
derivatives were used in feeding experiments because they 
are more stable and soluble compared to the free phenols. 
The glucose part of the precursors is believed to split off 
during the passage through the plasmalemma of the plant 
cells. Experiments using the three differently labelled pre- 
cursors showed that in all cases incorporation of radio- 
activity into the allylphenol derivatives eugenol and methyl- 
eugenol of 0. basilicum occurred (Table). 
A comparison of the 3H : 14C ratio of precursor and product 
clearly shows that there is no change in this ratio and 
therefore no loss of the C-1 atom of the sidechain during 
the ifi vivo conversion, as has been suggested ea~-l ier .~#~ 
Unequivocal degradation9 of the terminal carbon atom of 
both allylphenols from a ferulic acid feeding experiment 
demonstrated that ca. 97% of the 14C-label was located in 
this terminal position, corresponding to C-1 of the pre- 
cursors, since the resulting homoveratrum aldehyde con- 
tained only tritium and was devoid of 14C-activity. 
Of considerable interest is the fact that [y-l4CSH2OH]coni- 
ferin is incorporated into eugenol without change of the 
3H : 14C ratio. This demonstrates that both hydrogen atoms, 
linked directly to C-1 of the cinnamyl alcohol, are retained 
during the reduction to allylphenols and proves that these 
alcohols are immediate precursors in this conversion. 
These experiments show that allyl- and propenyl-phenol10 
derivatives of higher plants have common precursors and 
are biosynthesized as shown in the Scheme. The exact 
mechanism by which cinnamyl alcohol derivatives are 
reduced to allyl- or propenyl-phenols has still to be 
investigated.
