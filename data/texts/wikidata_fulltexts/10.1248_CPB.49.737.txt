In a series of papers on our chemical and chemotaxonomi-cal studies of Rhoiptelea chiliantha DIEL et HAND.-MAZZ., theonly species of the family Rhoipteleaceae, we have reportedthe structural elucidation of triterpenes,1) triterpene esters2)from the barks, diarylheptanoids,3) ellagitannins,4) euphane-type triterpene bisdesmosides and tridesmosides,5) anddammmarane-type triterpene glycosides6) from the fruits andleaves. In a continuation of this investigation, we chemicallystudied the branches whose constituents have not yet beenexamined, and also further separated the composition of thefruits. Herein, we describe the structural elucidation of twopyrrolidine alkaloids (1 and 2) from the fruits, a diphenylether-type diarylheptanoid (3) and a naphthalene carboxylicacid methyl ester (4) which is biogenetically-related to ju-glone from the branches.Results and DiscussionThe MeOH extracts of the air-dried fruits and branches ofRhoiptelea chiliantha were separately partitioned betweenH2O and Et2O, the remaining H2O layers were further ex-tracted with EtOAc. The H2O layer of the fruits was sub-jected to column chromatography over MCI-gel CHP 20P,Bondapak ODS and silica gel to afford compounds 1 and 2.The Et2O layer of the branch was chromatographed over sil-ica gel and MCI-gel CHP 20P to yield compound 3. The H2Olayer of the branches was chromatographed over SephadexLH-20 and silica gel to afford compound 4.Compound 1 was isolated from the fruits as colorless nee-dles, mp 178—180 °C. It showed a pink spot on TLC whensprayed with ninhydrin reagent followed by heating, indicat-ing the existence of nitrogen atom in its molecule. The mole-cular formula of 1 was established to be C13H17NO3 on thebasis of the molecular ion peak at m/z: 235 in EI-MS and theresult of elemental analysis, suggesting that 1 is an alkaloid.Its 1H-NMR spectrum displayed the signals due to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring [dH 7.50 (1H, dd, J52, 8 Hz),7.36 (1H, dd, J58, 9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, dd, J52, 9 Hz)], an N-methyl [dH 2.62 (3H, s)] and a methoxyl group [dH 3.87(3H,s)]. Besides these, the signals arising from a carboxylic car-bon, a methine [dC 62.4 (d, C-2)], and three methylenes [dC54.8 (t, C-5), 31.0 (t, C-3), 22.6 (t, C-4)] were confirmed bythe 13C-NMR and DEPT spectra. The correlations (Fig. 1) ofthe methylenes and methine in the 1H–1H COSY spectrumand their chemical shifts suggested the presence of a 2-sub-stituted pyrrolidine ring in compound 1.7) The HMBC corre-lations shown in Fig. 1 determined the positions of the car-boxylic acid group and methoxyl group in C-29 and C-69, re-spectively, in the benzene ring. Furthermore, the HMBC cor-relations from H-2 signal to C-19, C-29 and C-69 signals con-firmed the linkage of 2-substituted pyrrolidine ring to thebenzene ring at C-19 position. Thus, the plain structure of 1was concluded to be as shown in Fig. 1. The absolute config-uration of C-2 of 1 was determined to be R on the basis ofobservation of a negative Cotton effect at 246 nm in the CDspectrum.7)Compound 2 was also isolated from the fruits as colorlesscrystals, mp 221—223 °C and showed a positive reaction toninhydrin reagent on TLC by heating. Its molecular formulaof C12H15NO2 was deduced from the data of EI-MS spectrum(molecular ion peak at m/z 205 [M]1) and elemental analysis.The 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 2 were very similar to those of1, exhibiting a 2-substituted pyrrolidine ring, a carboxylicacid group, an N-methyl group and a benzene ring. However,the presence of a 1,2-disubstituted benzene ring in 2 insteadof a trisubstituted one in 1, and the absence of methoxylgroup in 2 indicated that there is no methoxyl group in C-69of the benzene ring. By comparing the NMR data of 2 withthose of dihydroshihunine isolated from Banisteriopsis cappi(Malpighiaceae),7) 2 was determined to possess a plain struc-ture the same as dihydroshihunine. But the sign of the opticalrotation of 2 (2257.4°) is opposite to that (1234.7°) of 2S-dihydroshihunine, suggesting 2 has a 2R configuration. Addi-tionally, the appearance of a negative Cotton effect at 244 nmin the CD spectrum of 2 also confirmed this conclusion.From the above evidence, compound 2 was assigned to 2R-dihydroshihunine.Compound 3 was isolated from the branches as a whiteamorphous powder which showed an [M]1 ion peak at m/zJune 2001 Chem.

A diphenyl ether-type diarylheptanoid (3), and a naphthalene carboxylic acid methyl ester (4)which is biogenetically-related to juglone were isolated from the branches of the same plant. Their chemicalstructures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence.Key words Rhoiptelea chiliantha; Rhoipteleaceae; pyrrolidine alkaloid; diarylheptanoid; chemotaxonomyFig. 1. Selected 1H–1H COSY and HMBC Correlations of Compound 1358 in the EI-MS spectrum. Taking the 13C-NMR data andthe result of elemental analysis into account, the molecularformula of 3 was established to be C21H26O5. In the 13C-NMR spectrum, the signals due to two aromatic nuclei andseven aliphatic carbons along with two methoxyl groupswere observed, indicating that 3 is a diarylheptanoid. Analy-sis of the aromatic signals in the 1H-NMR spectra suggestedthe presence of a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted [dH 6.89 (1H, d,J58 Hz, H-19), 6.69 (1H, d, J58 Hz, H-18)] and a 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring [dH 6.84 (1H, d, J58 Hz, H-3),6.70 (1H, dd, J52, 8 Hz, H-4), 5.72 (1H, d, J52 Hz, H-6)].In addition, a phenolic hydroxyl [dH 5.93 (1H, s, 15-OH)]and an alcoholic hydroxyl [dH 1.25 (1H, s, 9-OH)] whichwere exchangeable with D2O, and two methoxyl groups [dH4.00, 3.98 (each 3H, s)] were also confirmed in the 1H-NMRspectrum. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data mentionedabove are very similar to those of platycarynol8) (5) isolatedfrom Platycarya strobilacea (Juglandaceae), suggesting that3 is a diphenyl ether-type diarylheptanoid. The correlationsof the aliphatic protons in the 1H–1H COSY spectrum dis-played the connectivities from C-7 to C-13 (Fig. 2), revealingthe location of a hydroxyl group at C-9 position. The NOEcorrelations between H-13 and H-19, between H-13 and phe-nolic hydroxyl, and between H-6 and H-8 which were ob-served in the NOE spectrum of 3 revealed the linkage of C-7to C-5 of benzene ring A and C-13 to C-14 of benzene ring B(Fig. 2). Furthermore, the NOE correlations between H-3 andmethoxyl (dH 3.98), between phenolic hydroxyl andmethoxyl (dH 4.00) indicated the positions of methoxyls andhydroxyl in benzene rings. Hence, the linkage diphenyl etheris determined to be between C-1 and C-17. From the aboveevidence, the plain structure of 3 was determined to be asshown in Fig. 2.To determine the absolute configuration of the secondaryhydroxyl group at C-9, 3 was methylated with CH2N2 to give3a which was further esterified by (R)-a-methoxy-a-(trifluo-romethyl)-phenylacetic acid (MTPA) and (S )-MTPA, respec-tively. By applying the modification of Mosher’s method9) tothe MTPA esters (3b, c) of 3a, the positive and negative Dd(dS2dR) values shown in Fig. 3 unequivocally indicated a 9Rconfiguration in compound 3.The negative Cotton effect at 241 nm and the positive oneat 218 nm in the CD spectrum suggested the chiral plane of 3is expressed as S configuration which is the same as that of(2)-galeon, a diarylheptanoid isolated from the Myricaplant.10)Compound 4 was isolated as a light yellow powder fromthe branches. Its molecular formula was determined to beC12H10O4 by high resolution EI-MS. The 1H-NMR spectrumdisplayed the signals derived from a 1,2-disubstituted ben-zene ring [dH 8.32 (1H, dd, J51, 8 Hz), 8.16 (1H, dd, J51,8 Hz), 7.61 (1H, dt, J51, 8 Hz), 7.53 (1H, dt, J51, 8 Hz)], asinglet aromatic signal (dH 7.11) and a methoxyl group (dH3.98). The 13C-NMR spectral data indicated the presence ofan ester carbonyl (dC 172.2), a methoxyl group (dC 52.6) and10 aromatic signals, suggesting 4 is a naphthalene carboxylicacid methyl ester. Therefore, the remaining residues of 4 arededuced to be two hydroxyl groups. The carbonyl and thesetwo hydroxyl groups were determined to be located in C-2,C-1 and C-4, respectively, of the naphthalene ring by theHMBC correlations shown in Fig. 4. A glucoside of hydrox-ynaphthalene carboxylic acid methyl ester related to 4 wasreported to be present in Juglans mandshurica (Juglan-daceae).11)Compound 4, a methyl ester of compound 6, may be an ar-tifact produced in the course of plant extraction or isolation.Compound 6 is a biogenetically important intermediate in thebiosynthesis of juglone from O-succinoylbenzoic acid12)(Chart 1).738 Vol. 49, No. 6Fig. 2. 1H–1H COSY and NOE Correlations of Compound 3Fig. 3.

HMBC Correlations of Compound 4Chart 1In conclusion, we have isolated four new compounds (1—4) from the fruits and branches of Rhoiptelea chiliantha(Rhoipteleaceae). Compounds 1 and 2 belong to pyrrolidine-type alkaloids. Interestingly, compound 2 possesses an an-tipodal structure of 2S-dihydroshihunine which was isolatedfrom Banisteriopsis cappi (Malpighiaceae).7) Compound 3has the same skeleton as 5 which was isolated from Platy-carya strobilacea (Juglandaceae) in our previous paper.8)Compound 4 is considered to be biogenetically-related to ju-glone which is widely distributed in Juglandaceous plants.Chemotaxonomic studies on the Rhoipteleaceae based onour extensive and detailed investigations on the chemical con-stituents of Rhoiptelea chiliantha DIEL et HAND.-MAZZ.1—6)have suggested the relationships of the order Rhoipteleales(comprising Rhoipteleaceae) to the Juglandales (comprisingJuglandaceae), Fagales (comprising Betulaceae and Fa-gaceae) and Myricales (comprising Myriaceae).3) The exis-tence of 3 and 4 reported in the present paper further sup-ported the affinity of a systematic position between theRhoipteleales and Juglandales, and suggested the Juglandalesis probably the most closely related order to the Rhoipte-leales.ExperimentalGeneral Melting points were determined on a micromelting point hotstage apparatus (Yanagimoto) and are uncorrected. Optical rotations weremeasured with a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter. The CD spectra weremeasured with a JASCO J-725 apparatus. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra wererecorded on Varian Unity plus 500, Varian Gemini 300 and Varian Gemini200 spectrometers. Coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz, and chemi-cal shifts are given on a d (ppm) scale with tetramethylsilane as an internalstandard. FAB-MS were recorded on a JEOL JMS DX-303 spectrometerwith glycerol as a matrix. Column chromatographies were performed withKieselgel 60 (70—230 mesh, Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (25—100 mm, Phar-macia Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.) and MCI-gel CHP 20P (75—150 mm, Mit-subishi Chemical Co., Ltd.). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was per-formed on precoated Kieselgel 60 F254 plates (0.2 mm thick, Merck), andspots were detected by ultraviolet (UV) illumination and by spraying 10%sulfuric acid reagent or 2% ninhydrin in EtOH.Plant Material The fruits and branches of Rhoiptelea chiliantha werecollected in Guangxi, China in Oct., 1988.
