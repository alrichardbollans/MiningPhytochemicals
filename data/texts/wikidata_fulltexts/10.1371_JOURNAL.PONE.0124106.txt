To elucidate CA biosynthesis, glandular trichome transcriptome data of S. fru-ticosa were mined for terpene synthase genes. Two putative diterpene synthase genes,namely SfCPSand SfKSL, showing similarities to copalyl diphosphate synthase and kaur-ene synthase-like genes, respectively, were isolated and functionally characterized. Re-combinant expression in Escherichia coli followed by in vitro enzyme activity assaysconfirmed that SfCPS is a copalyl diphosphate synthase. Coupling of SfCPS with SfKSL,both in vitro and in yeast, resulted in the synthesis miltiradiene, as confirmed by 1D and 2DNMR analyses (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY H-H, HMQC and HMBC). Coupled transient in vivoassays of SfCPS and SfKSL inNicotiana benthamiana further confirmed production of miltir-adiene in planta. To elucidate the subsequent biosynthetic step, RNA-Seq data of S.PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 1 / 28a11111OPEN ACCESSCitation: Božić D, Papaefthimiou D, Brückner K, deVos RCH, Tsoleridis CA, Katsarou D, et al.

Three candidate genes were selected, SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2. Using yeast and N.benthamiana expression systems, all three where confirmed to be coding for ferruginolsynthases, thus revealing the enzymatic activities responsible for the first three steps lead-ing to CA in two Lamiaceae genera.IntroductionPhenolic diterpenes (PDs) belong to a class of labdane-related diterpenes having a phenolicfunctional group. One of the most studied PDs is carnosic acid (CA). Carnosic acid is of highimportance for the food and cosmetic industry, and may also have pharmaceutical applications,due to its strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties [1–4]. Diverse bio-logical activities, ranging from neuroprotective [5], antiphotoaging [6], antimicrobial [7], anti-angiogenic [8], hepatoprotective [9], anti-adipogenic [10], anti-hyperglycemic to lipid profile-improving [11] have been reported. Most of these biological activities likely stem from its easilyoxidizable o-diphenol structure [12]. Due to the significance of CA for the cosmetic, food andpharmaceutical industry, there is a great need to understand the processes leading to its biosyn-thesis. Salvia fruticosa and Rosmarinus officinalis, plant species of the Mediterranean basin andmembers of the Lamiaceae family, are known to be rich in PDs, especially CA, carnosol (C) androsmanol (Fig 1A) [13–17]. Elucidation of the CA biosynthetic pathway in Lamiaceae, by isolat-ing and functionally characterizing the genes involved, could lead to the development of novelmethods for the biotechnologically sustainable production of this molecule.It has been proposed that biosynthesis of PDs starts with two successive cyclization steps[18]. The initial cyclization reaction converts the common diterpene precursor, geranylgeranyldiphosphate (GGDP), into the bicyclic copalyl diphosphate (CDP). This protonation-initiatedcyclization reaction is catalyzed by class II diterpene synthases (class II diTPSs), termed copalyldiphosphate synthases (CPS), which form various stereoisomers of CDP (e.g. normal, ent-, orsyn-CDP). Products of class II diterpene synthases are further used by specific class I diterpenesynthases (class I diTPSs) to form specific polycyclic compounds [19]. Diterpene synthasesharbour characteristic aspartate-rich catalytic motifs in their active sites. The class II diterpenesynthases contain a conserved DXDDmotif involved in the protonation-initiated cyclizationof GGDP into bicyclic diphosphates [18,20,21]. The class I diterpene synthases contain aDDXXD motif involved in metal-dependent ionization of the prenyl diphosphate substrates[22,23]. Following the formation of the parent skeleton by the diterpene synthases, cytochromeP450 monooxygenases frequently catalyze secondary transformations of the newly formedpolycyclic diterpenes.Gao et al. (2009) reported the functional characterization of two diterpene synthases form-ing the precursors of the abietane-type norditerpenoid tanshinones in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Theclass II diterpene cyclase produces the normal stereoisomer of CDP from GGDP and wastermed CDP synthase (SmCPS). The class I diterpene cyclase that produces miltiradiene, a po-tential precursor to tanshinones, was named ent-kaurene synthase-like (SmKSL) [18]. Recent-ly, genes with high similarity to SmCPS and SmKSL were characterized from R. officinalis andshown to code for the same enzymatic activities [24]. Additionally, cytochrome P450 monoox-ygenases CYP76AH1 and CYP76AH4 that catalyze the formation of ferruginol, the first phe-nolic diterpene in the sequence of reactions coming after miltiradiene, have also recently beenFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 2 / 28Commission through its FP7 post-grant Gold OpenAccess Pilot.

The enzyme CYP76AH1 from S.miltiorrhiza, is potentially a part of thetanshinone biosynthetic pathway, while CYP76AH4 likely plays a role in the biosynthesis ofCA in rosemary. The substrate for these enzymes is abietatriene, a product of either spontane-ously occurring or enzymatically catalyzed miltiradiene aromatization [26].Here, we describe the isolation of two diterpene synthase genes (SfCPS and SfKSL) and onecytochrome P450 (SfFS) gene from Salvia fruticosa, responsible for the formation of the CAprecursors CDP, miltiradiene and ferruginol, respectively (Fig 1B). In addition, we report thecloning and functional expression of two R. officinalis ferruginol synthases (RoFS1 and RoFS2)in yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana. Characterization of the genes involved in the initial stepsof the CA biosynthesis in S. fruticosa and R. officinalis is an essential step for the successful elu-cidation of the CA biosynthesis pathway in Lamiaceae.Fig 1.

This analysis identi-fied the genotype Kavoussi as the richest source in PDs, followed by the commercial and Vryssesgenotypes, when whole leaves of all developmental stages were assessed (Fig 2A). Young leaveshad significantly higher amounts of the sum of CA and C than old leaves (Fig 2B). In addition, itwas found that trichome preparations from young leaves contained higher amounts of CA com-pared to leaves without trichomes, whereas, surprisingly, C accumulated in high quantities inleaves without trichomes and was present only in trace amounts in isolated trichomes (Fig 2C).Isolation and cloning of SfCPS and SfKSL genesPrevious work provided an EST database from a cDNA library constructed from S. fruticosaleaf trichome total RNA [27]. Two partial sequences in this database exhibited homology to po-tential diterpene synthases. The EST contig 195 (824 bp long, consisting of three ESTs, withGeneBank accessions JZ562276, JZ562277 and JZ562278) and contig 66 (706 bp, ESTs withGeneBank accessions JZ562273, JZ562274 and JZ562275), revealed homology to the family ofcopalyl diphosphate synthases and kaurene synthases, respectively. The two sequences werealso identified in another S. fruticosa leaf trichome EST database (http://www.terpmed.eu/).The entire ORF of both sequences was isolated, partly from the S. fruticosa trichome cDNA/EST library [27] and partly by RACE-PCR, using S. fruticosa trichome cDNA as the template.The two diterpene synthases were annotated as SfCPS and SfKSL. The ORFs of SfCPS andSfKSL consisted of 2391 and 1755 base pairs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed thatSfCPS belongs to the group of CPS proteins, while SfKSL is part of the KSL protein family (Fig3). Both enzymes belong to the Tps e/f group of terpene synthases [28]. The most similar se-quence to the deduced SfCPS amino acid sequence is Rosmarinus officinalis copalyl diphos-phate synthase—RoCPS1 (88% identity, accession number KF805857). The deduced aminoacid sequence of SfKSL showed highest similarity to Rosmarinus officinalis kaurene synthase-like 2—RoKSL2 (85% identity, accession number KF805859). Analysis of the isolated se-quences with TargetP 1.1 software indicated the existence of putative transit peptides in bothsequences, thus suggesting the plastidial localization of the mature proteins. Furthermore, ahighly conserved aspartate-rich DxDD motif, characteristic of class II diTPS, which is requiredfor the protonation-dependent cyclization of GGDP, was detected in the SfCPS sequence (S1Fig). SfKSL, on the other hand, possesses a DDxxD motif, required for Mg2+-mediated sub-strate binding and characteristic of class I diterpene synthases (S2 Fig). SfKSL lacks the γ-do-main and therefore likely has an α/β bi-domain protein structure.Tissue specificity and developmental expression of SfCPS and SfKSLReal-time PCR analysis demonstrated higher expression levels of SfCPS and SfKSL in isolatedtrichomes than in leaves without trichomes. Furthermore, a difference in expression levels ofthese genes could also be observed during leaf development. Young leaves showed higher accu-mulation of the SfCPS and SfKSL transcripts, when compared to the fully expanded leaves (Fig4). This expression pattern was consistent with the trichome and developmental regulation ofCA build-up (cf. Figs 2 and 4).Ferruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 4 / 28Fig 2. Accumulation of phenolic diterpenes in S. fruticosa leaves and trichomes.

Based on the TargetP 1.1 soft-ware prediction, the lengths of the two transit peptides were 30 and 49 amino acids for theSfCPS and SfKSL, respectively. His-tagged SfCPS protein was affinity purified and incubatedwith GGDP, after which the reaction mixture was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by alkalinephosphatase. Hexane-extracted reaction products were analysed by GC-MS. Using this ap-proach, it was possible to identify the dephosphorylated product of the SfCPS catalyzed reac-tion as copalol, by comparison with the Wiley mass spectra database (Fig 5A).To functionally characterize the SfKSL gene, affinity purified SfKSL protein was assayed invitro simultaneously with SfCPS in order to provide the necessary CDP substrate for the classI-type reaction. GGDP was added to the reaction as the substrate for SfCPS. GC-MS analysis ofthe hexane-extracted reaction products (Fig 5B) revealed a peak, which most closely corre-sponded to miltiradiene based on the published mass spectrum [18,24](Fig 5B).Next, the two diTPSs enzymatic activities were additionally assayed in yeast cells by recombi-nant expression and inN. benthamiana using agroinfiltration. First, S. cerevisiae strain AM104,which carries a chromosomal integration of Cistus creticusGGDP synthase (CcGGDPS1) [29],was co-transformed with the two diTPS of interest lacking the predicted transit peptide. Yeastcells extracted with hexane, and silica purified preparations analysed by GC-MS revealed thepresence of a miltiradiene-like compound (peak 1, Fig 6A and 6Ca), corroborating the results ofthe E. coli assays (compare Figs 5 and 6A). Additionally, the production of another compound(peak 2, Fig 6A) was detected, the mass spectrum of which matched most closely to that of abie-tatriene (Fig 6Cb), based on comparison with theWiley mass spectra database.Secondly, to perform the transient expression in planta, binary vector constructs containingthe full length SfCPS and SfKSL ORFs were co-infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves, togetherwith a viral silencing suppressor. After 5 days, hexane extracts of infiltrated leaves wereFig 4.

(2009), many abietane-type diterpenes exhibit highly similar mass spectra.To unambiguously identify this compound, its structure was determined by NMR spectrosco-py. For this, a 3.75 l culture of AM104 yeast cells co-expressing the two terpene synthases wasgrown, yielding approximately 20 mg of the miltiradiene-like compound (Peak 1, Fig 6A and6Ca), which after silica purification was subjected to NMR analysis (Fig 7). It should be notedthat abietatriene also co-eluted in small amounts with the miltiradiene-like molecule, but itspresence did not interfere with the structural characterization of the main compound (Peak 2,Fig 6A and 6Cb). On the basis of GC-MS, 1D and 2D NMR data (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY H-H,HMQC and HMBC), the purified compound was confirmed as miltiradiene (S4 Fig–S8 Fig).Selection, isolation and cloning of SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2Our previous S. fruticosa EST analysis [27] gave a limited number of CYPs. In order to identifythe P450 proteins responsible for the downstream steps of the CA biosynthetic pathway, it wasconsidered necessary to apply RNA-Seq on newly isolated trichomes from young leaves of S.fruticosa and R. officinalis (http://www.terpmed.eu/). These tissues where chosen because theyFig 5. The functional characterization of SfCPS and SfKSL in E. coli. A) SfCPS characterization.

Contigs encoding full length P450s wereselected by BLAST searches. Eighteen candidate sequences from S. fruticosa and eighteen fromR. officinalis could thus be identified. Among those, two sequences from S. fruticosa and twofrom R. officinalis that shared high similarity at the nucleotide level to the recently describedferruginol synthase genes from S.miltiorrhiza and R. officinalis [23, 28] were selected for fur-ther study. Upon PCR amplification and sequencing the two S. fruticosa candidate singletons,Sfru.N01.C016156 and Sfru.N01.C021415, turned out to correspond to different regions of thesame gene. This gene, together with the two R. officinalis genes was successfully isolated and se-quenced and the three candidate P450 genes were assigned the names SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2(an alignment of the corresponding protein sequences and the ferruginol synthases from S.mil-tiorrhiza and R. officinalis is given in the S3 Fig). The gene sequences were deposited in theGenBank (accession numbers: SfFS: KP091842, RoFS1: KP091843, RoFS2: KP091844). DetailedFig 6.

CYP71 is a multi-familyclan including more than a half of all plant CYPs [30]. Most of the CYP76 P450s are involvedin the metabolism of terpenoids [31].High-throughput quantitative expression analysis of isolated trichomes from different de-velopmental stages of leaves and in response to wounding, as a simulation of insect feeding, re-vealed that the expression of SfCPS and SfKSL followed the same pattern with SfFS (Fig 9).Expression of these genes was highest in young leaves and dropped in old leaves, whilst it wassuppressed by wounding after 3h or 6h.SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2 code for ferruginol synthasesThe three candidate CYPs genes, presumably coding for ferruginol synthases from S. fruticosa(SfFS) and from R. officinalis (RoFS1 and RoFS2) were expressed in yeast cells containing thetwo upstream diterpene synthase genes either from S. fruticosa or R. officinalis, as well as thecytochrome P450 reductase, CPR2, from Poplar [32]. Analysis of yeast extracts by GC-MS re-vealed the formation of ferruginol in all three strains analyzed (Fig 10). The identification offerruginol was performed based on published mass spectrum [25].Further, all three putative ferruginol synthase genes mentioned above were subcloned inAgrobacterium tumefaciens binary vectors (RoFS1 and RoFS2 in pGA643 and SfFS in pART7/pART27) and in vivo functional characterization was performed through a transient expressionin N. benthamiana. Ferruginol was detected in all transformed leaves’ hexane extracts whenanalysed by GC-MS confirming that these three genes, namely, SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2, werecoding for ferruginol synthases (Fig 11A). Chemical analysis of isolated trichomes from S. fruti-cosa and R. officinalis young leaves resulted in the detection of ferruginol (Fig 11B) showingthe ability of young trichomes to synthesize this compound. In addition, this accumulation offerruginol coincided with the expression of SfFS in trichomes of young leaves (Figs 9 and 11B).DiscussionIn this work, we describe the isolation and characterization of the genes, namely SfCPS, SfKSLand SfFS, coding for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of CA precursors in the youngFig 7.

These biosynthetic enzymes catalyse the formation of CDP, miltira-diene and ferruginol from GGDP, respectively. In addition, we functionally characterized twoR. officinalis genes, RoFS1 and RoFS2, homologous to SfFS, which catalyse the synthesis of fer-ruginol. Discovery of putative intermediates in the biosynthesis of CA brings us a step closer tofully understand the biosynthesis of this compound. Using this knowledge, currently practicedextraction from plant tissues could be replaced by more economical novel platforms for thebiotechnological production of CA. Ferruginol, a probable precursor of CA, possesses many bi-ological activities on its own [33–36], and the production of this compound using genetic engi-neering could be of great use for the pharmaceutical industry.The abietane-type diterpenes, miltiradiene and ferruginol, were recently identified as pre-cursors of tanshinones in S.miltiorrhiza, a Chinese medicinal herb [18,25] and putativeFig 8.

As in S.miltiorrhiza and R. officinalis, we confirmhere that the synthesis of these abietane diterpenes involves two distinct terpene synthases andone CYP enzyme. The isolation of CYPs that synthesize ferruginol in S. fruticosa and R. offici-nalis was possible after a transcriptomic analysis of trichomes from young leaves of these plants(http://www.terpmed.eu/), a phylogenetic analysis with known plant CYPs (Fig 8) and gene ex-pression correlation studies with SfCPS and SfKS (Fig 9). Subsequent expression of SfFS, RoFS1and RoFS2 in yeast (Fig 10) and N. benthamiana (Fig 11) systems resulted in the production offerruginol indicating that these genes are involved in the formation of ferruginol and ultimatelyin the synthesis of CA.Phylogenetically, SfCPS and SfKSL show close relationship to other diterpene synthases re-sponsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. In addition to CPS from R. officinalis andS.miltiorrhiza, in close proximity to the SfCPS amino acid sequence on the phylogenetic treeare also the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of copal-8-ol diphosphate (labda-13-en-8-oldiphosphate) from Cistus creticus (CcCLS), S. sclarea (SsLPPS) and Nicotiana tabacum(NtCPS2) [20,37,38]. SfKSL shows high homology to miltiradiene synthase from R. officinalis(RoKSL1/2) and S.miltiorrhiza (SmKSL), as already mentioned, but also to SsSS and Z-abienolsynthase from N. tabacum (NtABS) [37,38]. SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2 are closely phylogeneti-cally related to the two ferruginol synthases already characterized from Lamiaceae family,namely CYP76AH1 (S.miltiorrhiza) [25] and CYP76AH4 (R. officinalis) [26]. All of these en-zymes belong to the same single family or branch/subfamily, which is often the case with CYPsthat metabolize similar or related compounds [31]. Interestingly, CYP76AH4 is only 87.8%and 85.6% identical to RoFS1 and to RoFS2, respectively (S12 Fig). This points to the existenceof different isofunctional homologues of this enzyme in rosemary. It is also remarkable that aCYP from S. fruticosa reported here is more closely related to any of the R. officinalis CYPs(RoFS1, RoFS2 and CYP76AH4), than to the one from S.miltiorrhiza (CYP76AH1) (S12 Fig).The new functional homologues of ferruginol synthases retrieved in rosemary may represent,together with their homologue from S. fruticosa, new candidates for metabolic engineering andthe production of a number of highly useful diterpenes. Their existence also reflects the diversi-ty of cytochrome P450s and their evolution. Functionally redundant isoforms of proteins,often a result of gene duplication, may represent a base for the development of novel enzymaticfunctions. Cytochrome P450s playing redundant roles in plants have already been described[39,40]. More notably, this has been reported for some members of the CYP76 family, to whichferruginol synthases belong [41].Finally, it is worth noting that SmKSL, RoKSL1/2 and Salvia sclarea sclareol synthase (SsSS)were recently described as rare examples of the bi-domain diterpene synthases belonging to theTps-e/f subgroup lacking the γ-domain characteristic of the proteins [24,37,42]. The majorityof plant diterpene synthase proteins of the Tps-e/f subgroup exhibit, on the other hand, the α/β/γ tri-domain structure. SfKSL provides a new example of a diterpene synthase exhibiting thebi-domain structure. As in the case of SmKSL, SsSS and RoKSL1/2, the homology of SfKSL tothe other KSL sequences starts after their γ-domain, which indicates that the protein consistsonly of β and α domains, similarly to mono- and sesqui-TPSs.Chemical analysis identified S. fruticosa genotype originating from Kavoussi as the one withthe highest PDs concentration among the three genotypes investigated. This is in accordancewith previous findings showing that the essential oil content of S. fruticosa plants changesalong their native range on the island of Crete [43]. Kavoussi is a village located on the easterninfiltrated with A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 transformed with SfCPS, SfKSL, AtCPR1, RoFS2. B) Ferruginol detection in hexane extracts of trichomesisolated from (a) S. fruticosa leaves and (b) R. officinalis leaves. C) Mass spectrum for ferruginol.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106.g011Ferruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 15 / 28side of the island, which has higher annual temperatures, higher annual sunshine and lower an-nual precipitation than the village Vrysses located on the western part of the island. It has pre-viously been observed, by RAPD analysis of the S. fruticosa clones, that there is a geneticbackground to the variation of the chemical profiles, which most probably represents an adap-tation to the varying local environments [44]. The genetic basis for the diversity of chemicalprofiles was afterwards confirmed by cultivating the clones originating from three S. fruticosapopulations from different parts of Crete at the same location [45]. The clones, previouslyfound to exhibit differences both in essential oil profile and total phenolic contents, maintainedthese differences under constant greenhouse and field conditions [45]. Therefore, the differ-ences in PDs content shown in our work are genetic in origin and may present an adaptationto the environment from which these three genotypes come from.It was also shown that the production of PDs was developmentally regulated with the youngleaves having higher PDs content than the older ones. This pattern was also observed for CAcontent in R. officinalis [46] and for CA and C content in S. officinalis [47], as well as for lab-dane-type diterpenes from the leaves of another Mediterranean species, C. creticus [48]. Highconcentration of antioxidant PDs in the young, more vulnerable tissues, demonstrates the roleof these compounds in overcoming various environmental stresses.Lastly, our work revealed the trichomes as the site of ferruginol and CA accumulation in S.fruticosa. On the other hand, carnosol (C), a dehydrogenation product of CA, was predomi-nantly detected in the leaves without trichomes. Whether C is synthesized from CA in the tri-chomes and then transported into the leaves, or that CA is transported into leaves and is thenmetabolised into C, remains to be elucidated. In any case, all the above information is criticalfor choosing specific tissues, developmental stages and conditions to apply functional genomicstudies and especially deep RNA sequencing as a first approach for the isolation and characteri-zation of genes participating in the downstream steps of CA and C biosynthesis. The results ofchemical analysis were further verified by the higher expression of SfCPS, SfKSL and SfFS inisolated trichomes and in the early stages of the leaves’ development. Additionally, the expres-sion of these genes was influenced by mechanical wounding. This reaction has so far been ob-served for many terpenoid biosynthetic genes of different plant species, and represents adefence strategy against invading organisms [49].This study has elucidated the steps of the ferruginol biosynthesis and thus the likely initialsteps in the synthesis of CA in S. fruticosa. It not only provides the basis for further investiga-tion of the biosynthetic pathway of this valuable secondary metabolite, but it also adds to ourknowledge in the field of terpene synthases research.Materials and MethodsPlant materialS. fruticosa plants were grown either from seeds or explants collected from the wild populationsin Crete, Greece (Kavoussi—Eastern part and Vrysses—Western part of Crete) or orderedfrom a commercial seed supplier (B & TWorld Seeds, Aigues-Vives, France). By decisions ofthe Forest Directorates of Chania (Western part of Crete) [decision 5482/24.7.13; https://diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/BΛ45OP1Θ-YP9] and Lasithi (Eastern part of Crete) [decision 4269/20.11.13; https://diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/BΛ10OP1Θ-O0Μ] collection of sage (S. fruticosa) is al-lowed under certain conditions: a) during the flowering-ripening season, using scissors orknife and without cutting all the stems of the plant in order to ensure its reproduction and b)maximum collected quantity is 500 gr. Following the above directions, we clearly state that nospecific permissions were required for S. fruticosa sampling at the mentioned locationsFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 16 / 28(Kavoussi—Eastern part and Vrysses-Western part of Crete). We also state that the field stud-ies did not involve endangered or protected species.Seeds purchased from the same supplier have represented the starting plant material forRosmarinus officinalis. Plants were grown in the research greenhouse in the School of Agricul-ture, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, under controlled temperature (25/18°C, day/night, winter, 32/20°C, day/night, summer) and natural photoperiod. The greenhouse had sys-tems for climate control and data logger.Gene expression analysesHigh-throughput quantitative expression analysis of S. fruticosa genes. For gene ex-pression studies using the Biomark HD system, total S. fruticosa RNA was isolated from tri-chomes and leaves without trichomes from three different developmental stages of leaves(starting from the first expanded pair of leaves—stage 1, following with stage 4 and 7). Addi-tionally, total RNA was prepared from trichomes and leaves without trichomes of mechanicallywounded leaves belonging to the stage 1. Wounding was performed by cutting the leaves inuniform stripes with scissors in planta, and samples were collected after 0, 3, and 6 hours. Tri-chome isolation was performed using a combination of dry ice and synthetic brush abrasionmethods, as explained in the Supplementary Information (S1 Method). Total RNA was isolatedusing Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma, USA) from three independent biological repli-cates for the gene expression studies of different developmental stages, while for the woundingassays, two biological replicates were used.To remove traces of genomic DNA contamination, the RNA samples (1 μg) were treatedwith DNase I (DNA-free Kit, Ambion, USA) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. After removalof genomic DNA, RNA quality was determined using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, USA). ForRT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized from 400 ng of total RNA (DNA free) using Superscript IIIReverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA) and oligo-(dT) primers. Gene expression wasquantified by real-time PCR using the Biomark HD instrument (Fluidigm, USA) and 2x Sso-Fast EvaGreen supermix with low Rox (Biorad, USA) dye. The cDNA samples were diluted to6 ng/μl and pre-amplified using TaqMan PreAmp Master mix (Life Technologies, USA). Prim-ers were used at a final concentration of 500 nM. After pre-amplification cDNAs were treatedwith Exonuclease I to remove leftover primers. The qPCR analysis was performed in technicalduplicates following manufacturer’s instructions. Primer pairs for each gene candidate were de-signed based on the final isolated nucleotide sequences using Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/) and PrimerQuest (http://eu.idtdna.com/PrimerQuest/Home/Index). The PCRefficiency for each primer pair used was calculated according to a dilution series from a pooledcDNA sample including all biological treatments. Expression fold was calculated using an effi-ciency-corrected delta-Ct method [50]. The pp2a gene was selected as endogenous referencefor normalization of transcript levels.qPCR of S. fruticosa CPS and KSL genes. For the analysis of gene expression, young (1–2cm) and aged (3–4 cm) leaves were collected. Leaf material was frozen in liquid N2 immediatelyafter the collection and stored at -80°C until further processing. Isolation of trichomes was per-formed using the dry-ice abrasion method (S1 Method).High quality total RNA was isolated using the commercial Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit(Sigma, USA), according to the manufacturers’ specifications with additional ethanol washes.cDNA was constructed from 1 μg total RNΑ using the Superscript III kit (Life Technologies, USA)according to manufacturers’ specifications with 1 μg random primers (Life Technologies, USA).For gene expression analysis, primer pairs were manually designed (S3 Table). The endoge-nous control selected and used for normalizing all quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysesFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 17 / 28was the housekeeping gene elongation factor 4a (elf4a) [27]. Samples were prepared using theKAPA SYBR1 FAST qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA) and qPCR analysis for each samplewas performed with three technical replicates in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCRSystem (Life Technologies, USA). General thermocycler conditions were 95°C for 2 min; then6 cycles of 95°C for 35 s; 64°C for 30 s; 72°C for 30 s; followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 20 s;62°C for 20 s; 72°C for 15 s; a final extension at 72°C for 10 min and plate read at 76°C. Toidentify and verify the PCR products a melting curve was performed from 70°C to 95°C withreadings every 0.1°C and a 10 s hold between observations. Relative expression values were cal-culated by the expression data of isolated trichomes relative to those from leaves without tri-chomes. qPCR data and the correct relative quantitation of results (RQ), and therefore therelative expression for genes, was calculated based on the efficiency-adjusted delta Ct method,where the fold change in the target gene was determined with the following formula:Fold change = E-ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = (Cttarget gene- CtRef) at Point X—(Cttarget gene- CtRef) aPoint Y, and E is the efficiency of the reaction [27].It must be noted that each time, the statistical analysis takes into account the efficiencies ofthe reactions. Normalized expressions of the SfCPS and SfKSL genes were calculated using thesoftware program Q-gene [51].Isolation of SfCPS and SfKSL genes. For gene isolation, a leaf trichome cDNA library ofS. fruticosa provided by previous work [27] was initially used. Two partial sequences of poten-tial diterpene synthase genes (contig 66 and contig 195) were identified by sequence homologyto known diterpene synthase coding genes. As a first step to obtaining the 5’ and 3’ region ofthe candidate genes, PCR amplification with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technolo-gies, USA), was performed using the above cDNA library as a template. The PCR conditionswere as follows: 1 cycle of 2 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 55°C, and 2 minand 30 sec at 72°C; and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C.For contig 195 (putative SfCPS gene), combinations of gene-specific (793–03_F22_F1 and04_K19_R) and library plasmid-specific primers (M13F and pDNRLib reverse 2) were used(S4 Table). In this way, additional but incomplete information about the SfCPS sequence wasobtained, with the 5’ end of the gene still not revealed. To isolate the missing sequence ofSfCPS, 5´ RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Life Technologies, USA) wasfurther applied using S. fruticosa trichome total RNA as a template. Trichomes from youngleaves were extracted using the dry-ice abrasion method (S1 Method). RNA extraction was per-formed using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma, USA). For the reverse transcriptionreaction, gene specific primer 5CopR172_GSP1 was used and the cDNA was (dC)-tailed. Am-plification was performed using the two rounds of PCR, with a combination of the RACE kitprimers (Abridged Anchor Primer—AAP, Abridged Universal Amplification Primer—AUAP)and gene specific primers (first round- 5CopR140_GSP2, nested- 5CopR83_GSP3) (S4 Table),using the described PCR conditions. The 5´ RACE has resulted in identification of the SfCPScomplete sequence.PCR amplification using the cDNA library did not result in isolating any additional se-quence based on contig 66. It has resulted, though, in the isolation of 5’ and 3’ region of a simi-lar gene, with even higher homology to the family of KSLs. The primers were 424_02_A10Fand RCA02_A10_R (contig 66-specific), and M13F and pDNRLib reverse 2 (library plasmid-specific). Using the cDNA library, the sequence of this gene, named SfKSL, was fully identified.Finally, full-length cDNA of both SfCPS and SfKSL was amplified from trichome cDNA usingPlatinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies, USA), ligated into pCRII-TOPO vectorusing the Invitrogen TA cloning system (Life Technologies, USA) and verified by sequencing.ORF sequences for both isolated genes have been deposited in the GenBank with the followingaccession numbers: KP091840 (SfCPS) and KP091841 (SfKSL).Ferruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 18 / 28Isolation of cytochrome P450 genes. The cDNA sequences coding for candidate P450s ofS. fruticosa and R. officinalis were obtained based on trichome EST databases (http://www.terpmed.eu/). Two non-overlapping S. fruticosa singleton sequences (Sfru.N01.C016156 andSfru.N01.C021415), appeared to be transcripts of the same gene, according to a BLAST analysis.Sfru.N01.C016156 sequence represented the 50 end of the gene and contained the STARTcodon, while Sfru.N01.C021415 sequence comprised the 30 region with the STOP codon. Prim-ers for the full length sequence were designed based on the two singletons. For R. officinalis,two sequences with high similarity to each other (92,4% similarity of nucleotides), Roff.N01.C021640 and Roff.N01.C021643, were identified as candidates. The genes were amplified fromthe cDNA using Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA), clonedinto pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced.Phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the ClustalWprogram. A Neighbor—Joining tree was constructed using MEGA version 5 [52] with a boot-strap of 1000 replicates, and rooted with Physcomitrella patens PpCPS/KS as an outgroup. Se-quence analysis with TargetP 1.1 methodology has been used to predict the length of thetransit peptide-coding sequences of the isolated genes (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) [53]. A protein alignment using ClustalW (MegAlign, DNAStar) was done to calcu-late sequence distances in S12 Fig.E. coli expression. Based on the predictions performed using the TargetP 1.1 algorithm,the region coding for putative transit peptide of SfCPS was 90 bp, and for the SfKSL, 147 bplong. Using these results, pseudomature versions (m in the construct name) of the two geneswere cloned without the N-terminal transit peptide by PCR amplification from the pCRII--TOPO vector using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase with the addition of restriction sites. PCRproducts were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector. Upon sequence confirmation, the pseudoma-ture fragments were subcloned into ptacHA expression vector, yielding the final plasmids pta-cHA-SfCPSm and ptacHA-KSLm. ptacHA expression vector was created from pGEX-5Xvector (Pharmacia, USA) by replacing a GST-tag with N-terminal polyhistidine (6xHis) tagand a Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag.The mature versions of SfCPS and SfKSL ligated into ptacHA vector were expressed in E.coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL competent cells. Liquid cultures of the bacteria harbouringthe expression construct were grown to appropriate OD600 in Luria-Bertani medium supple-mented with antibiotics for selection (50 μg/ml Ampicillin, 50 μg/ml Kanamycin, 17 μg/mlChloramphenicol) with shaking at 37°C prior to induction with isopropyl thio-galactopyrano-side (IPTG). After induction, cultures were grown at room temperature. In order to define theoptimal conditions for bacterial expression of the mature SfCPS, combinations of different in-duction and growth parameters were tested (data not shown). Incubation at room temperaturefor 4 h of the culture induced with 0.4 mM IPTG, at the moment when the OD600 reached 0.5,gave the highest protein yields. These conditions were, thus, applied for producing the proteinthat was further purified and used in the enzymatic assays. For SfKSL, induction was per-formed in the same way as for SfCPS, with the only difference being that, after induction, cul-tures were incubated at room temperature for 16 h. Cell pellets collected after expression wereeither resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer directly for SDS-PAGE analysis of crude ex-tract, or stored at -20°C to be purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.Bacterial expression vector, ptacHA, carries an N-terminal polyhistidine (6xHis) tag, whichhas enabled the purification of overexpressed protein by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mMNaCl, 10 mMImidazole [pH 8.0]) with the addition of lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF). The amount of lysis buffer added was 1 ml per 10–20 ml of starting bacterialculture. The cell suspension was left on ice for 30 min, after which it was disrupted byFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 19 / 28sonication on ice until becoming slightly translucent. The lysate was cleared by centrifugationat 13000 g for 20 min at 4°C. 50 μl of 50% Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech, USA) equili-brated in lysis buffer was added per 1 ml of the cleared lysate. The bead suspension was incu-bated with rotation at 4°C for 60 min to allow the polyhistidine-tagged protein to bind theresin. The beads were then collected with centrifugation at 1400 rpm at 4°C in a benchtopcooled centrifuge. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mMNaH2PO4,300 mMNaCl, 20 mM Imidazole [pH 8.0]). The amount of washing buffer was 1 ml per 100 μlof 50% Ni2+ agarose slurry. The polyhistidine-tagged protein was eluted by adding 100 μl ofelution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mMNaCl, 250 mM Imidazole [pH 8.0]) per 100 μl of50% Ni2+ agarose slurry. Three separate elution fractions were collected. Aliquots of the wash-ing and elution fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE, and the first elution fraction was storedin 50% glycerol at -80°C to be assayed for activity later.Affinity purified SfCPS was assayed for activity by using 5 μl recombinant protein in a buffercontaining 10 mMMOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mMMgCl2, 0.2 mMMnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and60 μM geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGDP) as a substrate, in 0.25 ml final volume. Assaymixtures were incubated overnight at room temperature and the resulting mixtures were incu-bated at 37°C for 4 h with 0.025 units/μl of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara, Japan) withthe addition of equal volumes of hexane overlay. Hydrolyzed products were hexane extractedand traces of water were removed by adding a small amount of Na2SO4, which was next re-moved by centrifugation. The extracts were concentrated to 50 μl by rotary evaporation priorto analysis by GC-MS.To identify SfKSL products, enzyme reactions contained 3 μl of SfKSL affinity purified pro-tein in assay buffer, as above, containing 2 μl of purified SfCPS, 200 μMGGDP (substrate forSfCPS) in 50 μl final volume. Reaction mixtures were immediately carefully overlaid with equalvolume of hexane, and left to incubate at room temperature overnight. Reaction products werehexane extracted and treated as above to remove traces of water. The extracts were stored at4°C to be analysed by GC-MS.Expression assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SfCPSm and SfKSLm were both sub-cloned from ptacHA into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression vectors, pUTDH3(PTDH3 2 μ URA3) for the SfCPSm and pHTDH3myc (PTDH3 2 μHIS3) for SfKSLm, yieldingthe final plasmids pUTDH3-SfCPSm and pHTDH3-SfKSLm. The plasmids were co-trans-formed into AM104 yeast strain and the clones containing both plasmids were selected on glu-cose CMmedia lacking uracil and histidine. The final yeast strains were cultivated in 50 mlliquid media at 30°C and 250 rpm.The strain AM104 was developed from the previously described AM102 strain [54], harboringheterozygous deletions in the genesUBC7/ubc7, ssm4/SSM4, erg9/ERG9 and chromosomally inte-grated expression cassettes overexpressing a stabilized variant ofHMG2 was used the parentalstrain for further modification. The strain was modified with COD7/CcGGDPS1 cassette, whichwas developed by PCR amplifying the ORF of CcGGDPS1 [29] using primersCcGGDPS1-BamHI and CcGGDPS1-XhoI (S5 Table). The amplified ORF was cloned into theCOD7 integration cassette vector [54] (PTDH3-MCS-ts-LoxP-HIS5-LoxP) using BamHI and XhoIrestriction enzymes generating the construct COD7/CcGGDPS1 (PTDH3-CcGGDPS1-ts-LoxP-HIS5-LoxP). The COD7/CcGGDPS1 cassette was then PCR amplified using primers 5-FLO8--COD7 and 3-FLO8-COD7 (S5 Table) which incorporate flanking sequences that are homologousto the 3’UTR region of FLO8 gene. The cassette was transformed into AM102 cells and coloniesgrowing in the absence of histidine were selected. The transformed colonies were tested by co-ex-pressing CrtI and CrtYB genes of carotenoid biosynthesis. The strain with most intense colorationdue to carotenoid production was selected. TheHIS5 selection marker was excised by transientlyexpressing Cre recombinase, as previously described [55], generating strain AM104 (S6 Table).Ferruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 20 / 28SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2 were subcloned from pCRII-TOPO constructs into the yeast expres-sion vector pWTDH3 (PTDH3 2 μ TRP1). SfFS was transformed into the above mentioned yeaststrain AM104, which already contained the SfCPSm and SfKSLm gene constructs. RoFS1 andRoFS2 were individually transformed into the AM113 yeast strain containing the RoCPS1mand RoKSL1f gene constructs [24]. The AM113 strain harbors heterozygous deletions forERG9, UBC7, SSM4,MCT1,WHI2, and expresses chromosomal inserted GGDPS1 from Cistuscreticus, the FDPS1 from Salvia fruticosa and further contains two copies of a stabilizedHMG2variant [24]. All the yeast strains were additionally transformed with a PtCPR2 gene [32],cloned into the pYX143 vector. Produced volatiles by the transformed yeast cells were sampledby Solid Phase Micro-extraction (SPME) by using 2 cm-50/30 μmVB/Carboxen/PDMS Stable-Flex Fiber for Manual Sampling (Supelco, USA). Yeast cultures were grown in 50 ml flasks tosaturation achieved after 24–48 h and volatiles were collected by SPME fibre for 30 min. Theexposed SPME fibre was withdrawn into the outer septum-piercing needle and removed fromthe flask, which made it ready for analysis using GC-MS.Liquid-liquid extraction of the 25 ml yeast cultures was performed with 3×25 ml of purehexane. After overlaying with hexane, the cultures were sonicated for 15 min in an ultrasonicwater bath at 40°C. Hexane extracts were combined, dried using anhydrous MgSO4, evaporatedunder a stream of air to a final volume of 100 μl and analysed by GC-MS. Extraction for thestructural characterization by NMR was performed by overlaying yeast cultures (750 ml) withequal volumes of hexane followed by vigorous shaking by hand. The extraction was repeatedthree times.Transient expression of SfCPS, SfKSL, SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2 in Nicotiana benthami-ana. The entire open reading frame (ORF) of each gene (SfCPS, SfKSL, SfFS, RoFS1 andRoFS2) was PCR-amplified from pCRII-TOPO constructs with the addition of restriction sites.SfCPS, SfKSL, RoFS1 and RoFS2 sequences were subcloned into the expression vector pGA643[56], while in the case of SfFS, pART7/pART27 binary vector system was used [57]. These ex-pression vectors contain the CaMV 35S promoter and the nptII kanamycin resistance gene.Upon sequencing, constructs pGA643-SfCPS, pGA643-SfKSL, pART27-SfFS, pGA643-RoFS1and pGA643-RoFS2 were introduced into A. tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) strain using thefreeze-thaw method. An additional transformation was performed with cytochrome P450 re-ductase from A. thaliana (AtCPR1) cloned in pICH47732 vector. Transformed cells weregrown on LB agar plates supplemented with antibiotics for selection of transformants until theappearance of visible colonies (rifampicin 50 μg/ml, gentamycin 25 μg/ml, and tetracycline15 μg/ml for pGA643 constructs; rifampicin 50 μg/ml, gentamycin 25 μg/ml and spectinomy-cin 25 μg/ml for pART27 construct). LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics was inoculat-ed from single colonies and the cultures were grown for 48 h at 28°C with vigorous shaking(250 rpm). Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4000×g. In addition, Agrobac-terium strain harbouring a gene encoding the viral p19 silencing suppressor was also prepared[58]. For SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2 transient expression, Nicotiana benthamiana plants stably ex-pressing the p19 silencing suppressor gene kindly provided by Dr. Kriton Kalantidis (Univ. ofCrete, Heraklion, Greece) were used for the infiltration experiments.Next, the cells were resuspended in the buffer containing 10 mMMES, 10 mMMgCl2 and100 μM acetosyringone (Sigma, USA) to a final OD600 of approximately 0.5 and left to incubateat room temperature with gentle shaking (50 rpm) for 2 h. Equal volumes of A. tumefacienscells from each gene construct resuspended in the buffer were used to infiltrate leaves of N.benthamiana, with a needleless 1 ml syringe. Plants were grown in the growth chamber at 23°Cwith 16 h light/8 h dark cycle for five days. After five days, infiltrated leaves were harvested andpulverized in liquid N2 with mortar and pestle. One gram of fine powder was extracted with2×3 ml pure hexane after a brief vortexing followed by sonication for 15 min in an ultrasonicFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 21 / 28water bath. Combined hexane phases were separated from the precipitated leaf tissue after cen-trifugation for one min at 5000 rpm, dried using anhydrous MgSO4, evaporated under a streamof air to a final volume of 50 μl and analysed by GC-MS.GC-MS analysis. GC-MS analyses for the E. coli, yeast and N. benthamiana extracts werecarried out using a Shimadzu GC/MS-QP2010 system (Shimadzu, Germany) connected to amodel QP-2010 electron impact (EI) mass spectrometer. Data acquisition and control of theGC/MS-QP2010 system was carried out using the GC-MS solution software. Chromatographicseparation was achieved on an HP-5-MS capillary column (Agilent, USA) (30 m×0.25 mminner diameter; 0.25 μm film thickness) for the yeast and N. benthamiana extract analysis, anda ZB5 (Phenomenex, USA) (0.25 mm×30 m, 0.25 μm film thickness) column for the E. coli ex-pression extract. The carrier gas was ultra-high purity helium at a flow rate of 1.03 ml/min. Forthe enzymatic assay products (E. coli expression) the hexane extract was manually injected intothe heated injector in the splitless mode. The inlet temperature was set to 230°C. The columntemperature was raised from 60°C to 240°C with a rate of 3°C/min and maintained at this tem-perature for 5 min to equilibrate. For the yeast and N. benthamiana extract analyses, splitlessmode was also used for the injector with the inlet temperature set to 230°C. The column tem-perature was initially held at 60°C for 1 min, then raised at 240°C with a rate of 3°C/min andheld for 15 min. The extracts (1 μl) were injected automatically via the AOC20i-AOC20s auto-sampler. For the analysis of SPME sampled volatiles, manual injection of the device needle intothe heated injection port of the gas chromatogram was performed.Chromatographs in Fig 11 were generated using a 2010 Plus Shimadzu gas chromatographwith GCMS-QP2010 Ultra gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. Chromatographic separa-tion was achieved on a MEGA-5 MS capillary column (MEGA s.n.c., Italy) (30 m×0.25 mminner diameter; 0.25 μm film thickness). The column temperature was initially held at 50°C for3 min, then raised at 300°C with a rate of 14°C/min and held for 3 min. The extracts (2 μl) wereinjected automatically via the AOC-20 Dual autosampler.Structure elucidation. For structural characterization by NMR, yeast culture extractswere purified by silica gel flash column chromatography in hexane. This resulted in obtaining afraction that contained 20 mg of the compound of interest, which was a satisfactory amountfor the analysis by NMR.NMR spectra for miltiradiene were recorded at 25°C on a Bruker Avance III at 300 MHz for1H and 75 MHz for 13C, respectively, using CDCl3 as solvent. Chemical shifts are expressed inδ values (parts per million) relative to TMS as internal standard for 1H and relative to TMS(0.00 ppm) or to CDCl3 (77.05 ppm) for13C NMR spectra. Coupling constants nJ are reportedin Hertz. Moreover, the complete assignment of 1H and 13C NMR signals was possible using1D and 2D experiments (COSY H-H, HMQC, and HMBC) using the standard commercialpulse programs.The first structure elucidation for miltiradiene was reported earlier by Gao et al. (2009) fol-lowed by Sugai et al. (2011) [18,59]. The mass spectrum of the product showed a molecular ionatm/z 272. The 20 different carbon signals from the 13C-NMR in conjunction with the molecu-lar ion led to a possible diterpene structure without any symmetry. The four alkenyl carbon sig-nals at 140.0, 135.5, 124.0, and at 116.5 ppm revealed two C = C double bonds. Further, 2DNMR data analysis suggested that the synthesized product was the miltiradiene. The protonsignal at 1.26 ppm corresponding to the carbon resonated at 29.8 ppm is attributed to an impu-rity from hexane used for extractions. The complete assignment of proton and carbon chemicalshifts is presented in S7 Table and in S4 Fig.In rings A and B the methylene protons are arranged as axial or equatorial and resonated atabout 1.1–1.3 and 1.5–1.7 ppm, respectively. The methylene carbons C7, C11 and C14 are at-tached to alkenyl carbons of ring C having an almost coplanar conformation. Therefore, theFerruginol Biosynthesis in LamiaceaePLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124106 May 28, 2015 22 / 28protons corresponding to these methylene groups are not diversified and give an almost identi-cal pattern of multiplets. The almost identical methyl signals for C16 and C17 show two dou-blets with coupling of 7.0 Hz with the methine proton at C15. The differentiation of the two C4methyl groups is achieved on the basis of NOE and 13C chemical shift data. Namely, there is apositive NOE between methyl protons resonated at 0.99 and at 0.86, corresponding to C20 andC19, respectively. There is also a significant difference in the 13C chemical shift data of the twoC4 methyl groups attributed to their axial and equatorial configuration. C19 methyl and C20methyl groups both being in axial configuration have 1,3-diaxial steric interaction resultingthus for both methyl carbons upfield resonances around 20 ppm, whereas the C18 methylbeing in equatorial configuration resonates at 33.3 ppm.The structure of miltiradiene, with numbering of skeleton as well as with assignments ofproton and carbon NMR chemical shifts is depicted in S4 Fig. Moreover, in S5 Fig–S8 Fig the1H and 13C NMR spectra are presented, whereas in S9, S10 and S11 Figs some diagnosticHMBC correlations between carbons and protons via 2JCH and3JCH couplings are illustrated.In the case of cyclohexadiene ring C correlations are observed also via 4JCH couplings throughthe double bonds.LC-PDA-MS analysis of phenolic diterpenes. Phenolic diterpenes were monitored in S.fruticosa a) whole leaves of all stages of development from the 3 different genotypes mentionedin “Plant Material” section, b) from young and old leaves of the genotype Kavoussi and c) fromisolated trichomes and leaves without trichomes of very young leaves (appr. 1 cm long) of thegenotype Kavoussi. The pots had 2 l capacity, containing peat and perlite in ratio 3:1. Plantswere watered with a complete balance fertilizer every 20 days. The supplement light followedthe natural photoperiod (10 h) and the distance between plants and lamps was 120–160 cm,with a light volume measured at 16–12 Klux. Trichome isolation was performed using thebead-beater abrasion method (S1 Method). The leaves' material was frozen in liquid N2 andground to a fine powder with mortar and pestle. For each experiment, three independent bio-logical samples were processed.Next, compounds were extracted by adding 75% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid in aratio of 5:1 (ml: g FW), followed by sonication for 15 min. Extracts were centrifuged and fil-tered over a 0.45 μm PTFE (Teflon) filter into an HPLC vial with glass insert. Phenolic diter-penes were separated, identified and quantified by using a LC-PDA-LTQ-Orbitrap FTMSsystem (Thermo Scientific) consisting of an Accela HPLC with photodiode array detector(240–600 nm) connected to an LTQ/Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with an ESIsource. Injection volume was 5 μl. Chromatographic separation was on a reversed phase col-umn (Luna C18/2, 3 μ, 2.0×150 mm; Phenomenex, USA) at 40°C, using a linear gradient from5 to 75% acetonitrile (acidified with 0.1% formic acid) in 45 min and a flow rate of 0.19 ml/min. FTMS full scans (m/z 90–1200) were recorded in negative ionization mode with a resolu-tion of 60,000. Phenolic diterpenes were identified based on similarity with the authentic stan-dards of carnosic acid and carnosol, with respect to both absorbance spectrum, accurate mass,allowing a maximum of 3 ppm deviation from the calculated masses, and co-elution. Bothcompounds were quantified based on the chromatographic area of their specific mass.Statistical analysis. Values are expressed as means ± SD or ± SE, and statistical signifi-cance was analyzed by Student’s t-test. All probability (p) values were based on two-tailed tests,and p< 0.05 was considered significant.Supporting InformationS1 Method.
