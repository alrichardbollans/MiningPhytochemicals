The roots of Stellera chamaejasme L. (Thymelaeaceae) area traditional Chinese medicine called lan du (roudoku inJapanese) that is used as diuretic and remedy for cough andskin diseases.1) Previous studies2—6) on the chemical con-stituents of this plant have resulted in reports on groups ofbiflavonoids, lignans, diterpenes, etc. To achieve a deeper un-derstanding of the chemistry of this crude drug, we under-took detailed chemical studies on the roots of S. chamae-jasme L. collected in Ningxia, China, leading to the isolationof three new compounds (1—3) and 18 known ones from theMeOH extract. In this paper, we describe the structure eluci-dation and chemotaxonomic significance of these secondarymetabolites.MeOH extract of the roots was partitioned between H2Oand Et2O and then the H2O layer was further extracted withEtOAc to afford Et2O, EtOAc, and H2O layers. Each Et2Oand H2O layer was fractionated and purified by various col-umn chromatographies as described in the Experimental sec-tion. Compounds 1 and 2, along with isochamaejasmin,6)neochamaejasmin B,3a) chamaechromone,4) daphnodorin B,7)daphnodorin I,8) (1)-pinoresinol,5) (1)-lirioresinol B,5)matairesinol,5) (1)-wikstromol,9) (1)-lariciresinol,10) wik-stroelide M,11) simplexin,2) umbelliferone,12) and daph-noretin,13) were obtained from the Et2O layer. Compound 3together with (1)-pinoresinol di-O-b-D-glucopyranoside,14)syringin,15) syringinoside,15) and skimmin16) were isolatedfrom the H2O layer. The known compounds were identifiedby comparing their spectral and physical data with reportedvalues.Compound 1, a pale yellow amorphous powder, exhibitedan [M2H]2 ion peak at m/z: 555 in the negative FAB-MSspectrum, corresponding to a molecular formula C31H24O10,which was confirmed by elemental analysis. The 1H- and13C-NMR spectra of 1 displayed signals due to a methoxylgroup [dH 3.80 (3H, s), dC 56.1] and two sets of closely re-lated signals, which were very similar to those of neo-chamaejasmin A,3) a symmetric biflavanone from S. cha-maejasme with a C-3/C-30 linkage. The position of the me-thoxyl group was determined to be at C-7 by observation ofthe nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlations in the dif-ference NOE experiment between H-6 and the methoxylgroup, and between H-8 and the methoxyl group (Fig. 1).The stereochemistries at the C-2/C-3 and C-20/C-30 positionswere established to be cis, cis geometry on the basis of the J-values of the corresponding protons [5.46, 5.47 (each 1H,br s, H-2, 20), 3.04 (2H, br s, H-3, 39)]. This was further sup-ported by a difference NOE experiment that revealed NOEcorrelations (Fig. 1) between H-2 and H-3, and between H-20and H-30. On the basis of above evidence, compound 1 wasconcluded to be 7-methoxylneochaejasmin A.Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder.Its molecular formula was determined to be C35H52O9 on thebasis of its high-resolution mass (HR-MS) spectrum. Boththe 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of 2 are very similar to those of wikstroelide M isolated from Wikstroemia retusa(Thymelaeaceae),11) suggesting the existence of a daphnane-type diterpene moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid with adiene system in the molecule. With the aid of 1H–1H correla-tion spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single-quantumcorrelation (HSQC), and heteronuclear maltiple bond con-nectivity (HMBC) (Fig. 2) techniques, the assignments of1H- and 13C-NMR signals of 2 were completed. It was foundthat the signals due to the diterpene moiety closely resem-bled those of wikstroelide M, except for an upfield shift by1.25 ppm for the H-14 signal and downfield shift by10.4 ppm for C-13. We concluded that the location of theester linkage of the fatty acid unit to the diterpene moiety isat the 13-hydroxyl group. As compound 2 is 14 mass unit (a methylene) larger thanwikstroelide M, the fatty acid unit in 2 was suggested to bepentadecadienoic acid. Furthermore, based on the 1H–1HCOSY and HMBC correlations (Fig. 2), two double bondswere determined to be conjugated and they are adjacent tothe ester carbonyl carbon of the fatty acid. The stereochem-istry of the diene system of the fatty acid unit was assignedto be 29E, 49E because large coupling constants (16 Hz) be-tween H-29 and H-39 and between H-49 and H-59 were ob-served. Thus the structure of 2 was determined as shown inFig. 2. Compound 2 contains an unsaturated fatty acid withodd carbon numbers, which is the same as that of wik-stroelide N isolated from W. retusa (Thymelaeaceae).11)Compound 3, a white amorphous powder, displayed anJanuary 2002 Notes Chem.

(Thymelaeaceae).Elucidation of these secondary metabolites of S. chamaejasme L. supplied strong chemical verification of theclose taxonomic relationships among the genera Stellera, Daphne, and Wikstroemia, all of which belong to thefamily Thymelaeaceae.Key words Stellera chamaejasme; Thymelaeaceae; biflavanone; daphnane diterpene; coumarin glycoside; chemotaxonomy[M1H]1 ion peak at m/z: 457 in the positive FAB-MS spec-trum. Its formula was determined to be C20H24O12 on thebasis of its molecular weight, results of elemental analysis,and 13C-NMR spectral data. The presence of an umbellifer-one unit in addition to a pentose and a hexose in the mole-cule of 3 was deduced from its 1H- and 13C-NMR spectraldata, suggesting 3 to be a glycoside of umbelliferone. By cal-culating the coupling constants of the sugar proton signals ofthe acetylated 3 (3a) which were assigned based on the1H–1H COSY spectrum, the sugars in 3 were clarified to be axylopyranose and a glucopyranose. Moreover, since thechemical shift of C-6 of the glucose moiety is 66.2 ppm, andno downfield shift was observed for H-6 signals of the glu-cose moiety in 3a compared with those in 3, the glycosidiclinkage was determined to be located at C-6 of the glucosemoiety. To clarify the absolute stereochemistry of the sugars,3 was subjected to acid hydrolysis with HCl to liberated D-glucose and D-xylose together with aglycone umbelliferone.The anomeric protons of each sugar appeared as a doublet(J57 Hz), suggesting each has b-linkage. Thus compound 3was determined to be O-[b-D-xylopyranosyl(1→6) b-D-glu-copyranosyl] 7-hydroxycoumarin.In conclusion, we have isolated a new biflavanone (1) witha C-3/C-30 linkage, a new daphnane-type diterpene (2) acy-lated by an unsaturated fatty acid, and a new coumarin glyco-side (3), along with 18 known compounds, namely, fiveflavonoids, six lignans, two phenylpropanoids, two diter-penes, and three coumarins, from the roots of S. chamae-jasme L. (Thymelaeaceae). Although daphnodorin B, daphn-odorin I, wikstromol, wikstroelide M, and skimmin were iso-lated from the genus Stellera for the first time, most of theseknown compounds have been reported to exist in Daphneand Wikstroemia plants belonging to the familyThymelaeaceae. These secondary metabolites supply a strongchemical confirmation of the close taxonomic relationshipsamong the genera Stellera, Daphne, and Wikstroemia.ExperimentalGeneral Optical rotations were measured with a JASCO DIP-370 digi-tal polarimeter.
