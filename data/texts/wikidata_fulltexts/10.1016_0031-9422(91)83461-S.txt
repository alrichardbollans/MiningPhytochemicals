Abstract-Unequivocal evidence is presented for the presence of 0.55-O.81% caffeine in the beans of population A213 
of Coffea kianjavatensis, one taxon of the Mascarocoffea, which traditionally have been viewed as caffeine-free.

INTRODUCTION 
Coffees belong to the family Rubiaceae, subfamily 
Cinchonoideae, tribe Coffeeae. The Coffeeae have re- 
cently been restricted to two genera, Cofia (with three 
subgenera) and Psilanthus (with two subgenera) [l]. Our 
previous chemotaxonomic studies [2, 31 on the seeds 
from 27 species of Coffea and 4 species of Psilanthus have 
tended to support Robbrecht and Puff's morphological 
classification [l], although it was recognised that seeds 
from a considerable number of other species had yet to be 
analysed. Among these omissions were the geographic- 
ally restricted species from Madagascar and neigh- 
bouring islands which in 1947 Chevalier [4] designated as 
Mascarocoffeu. Chevalier et al., believed that the seeds of 
Mascarocoffea were caffeine-free, and essentially this be- 
lief has been substantiated, with traces of caffeine being 
found in only one of some 20 taxa examined more 
recently [5]. We now report data obtained independently 
by groups working in Guildford and Montpellier show- 
ing the presence of significant quantities of caffeine in the 
beans from one Midagascan Mascarocoffea. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Bean samples were prepared by the Research Centre of 
Kianjavato, FO.FI.FA., Madagascar, and supplied after 
drying to CU 10% moisture content. The data reported 
below were obtained independently late in 1988, but it 
was not until mid-1990 that both groups realised that 
identical conclusions had been reached. Thereafter, it 
seemed sensible to prepare this joint publication. 
Using different methods of extraction and HPLC both 
groups observed a 276 nm absorbing peak which could 
not be resolved from authentic caffeine added as a spike. 
Comparison with caffeine standards suggested a putative 
caffeine content in excess of 0.5% db. No record could be 
found of the seeds of C. kianjavatensis having been 
analysed for caffeine, a situation no doubt arising due to 
acceptance of Chevalier's assertion that the seeds of 
Mascarocoffea were caffeine-free. Accordingly, both 
groups sought confirmation by spectroscopic methods, 
and the material corresponding to the peak in question 
was collected by preparative chromatography of the 
concentrated extract prepared either at reduced pressure 
(Guildford), or by partitioning into chloroform 
(Montpellier). The isolates so obtained were subjected to 
mass, UV, NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. 
Coffea kianjavatensis, in common with many other 
coffees, has a significant content of caffeoylquinic acids 
(5.9% db), and dicaffeoylquinic acids (0.69% db), but only 
traces of feruloylquinic acids. Two other 276 nm absorb- 
ing components, previously referred to as components A 
and C [2], and which may be related to caffeine, are under 
investigation. In each case the data obtained for the 
isolate were indistinguishable from those obtained 
for authentic caffeine. The wavelengths of maximum 
absorption were 209 and 273nm in EtOH 
(Guildford) and 273 nm in H,O (Montpellier). The 
'HNMR spectrum in DMSO-d, showed four singlets at 
6 8.02 (lH, H-8), 3.87 (3H, N-7 Me), 3.41 (3H, N-3 Me) 
and 3.22 (3H, N-1 Me). The IR spectrum (CC14 solution) 
showed two carbonyl peaks at 1711 and 1667cm-'. 
Mass spectroscopy gave a [MI' at m/z 194.12 (100%) 
together with fragment ions at m/z 165 (5%, [M 
-NMe]+), m/z 137 (7.1%, [M-C2H3N0]+), m/z 109, 
(58%, C5H7N3), m/z 82 (29%, C4H6N,), m/z 67 (38%0, 
C4H,N) and m/z 55 (49%). The mean caffeine content of 
the beans (four replicates) obtained in Guildford by 
HPLC was 0.53%; the corresponding mean value ob- 
tained in Montpellier was 0.81% by GC. These values are 
considerably greater than the 0.07% and 45 mg kg- 
previously observed in C. mauritiana [S, 61 and similar to 
those for several east African species placed in Coffea 
subgenus Coffea [2]. 
Our observations indicate that Chevalier's description 
of Mascarocoffeu as caffeine-free is no longer tenable if all 
Madagascan species are included. Therefore, there is a 
need for further investigations of these geograhically 
isolated species to ascertain their correct position within 
the classification proposed by Robbrecht and Puff [I].

shade to ca 10% moisture content. 
Methods, Montpellier. Grinding and H,O extraction of 
beans and G C  analysis for caffeine were as described in ref. [7]. 
Prepn and purification ofa 70% MeOH extract was as described 
in ref. [8] and analytical reverse-phase HPLC was performed as 
described for cocoa phenols in ref. [SI. MS were obtained at  
70 eV in EI mode; source temp. was 250" with desorption from 
20" to 250". 
Methods, Guildford. Grinding and extraction of beans and 
analytical and prep. reverse-phase HPLC were as previously 
described (2, 10-121. 'HNMR spectra were obtained at
