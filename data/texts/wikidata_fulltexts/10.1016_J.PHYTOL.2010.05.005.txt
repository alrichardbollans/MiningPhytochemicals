Two new naphthalene acylglucosides, rumexneposides A (1) and B (2), together with 12 known
compounds (3-14), were isolated from the roots of Rumex nepalensis. Their structures were established
by chemical and spectroscopic methods. The biological activities of compounds 1-14 as well as an
additional 11 compounds previously isolated from R. nepalensis and Rumex hastatus (15–25) were
evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, para-aminobenzoic acid (pAba) pathway, and a panel of
human cancer cell lines. The results showed that compound 15 was the most active against M.
tuberculosis with an MIC value of 2.85 mM similar to that of isoniazid. Compound 5 could inhibit pAba
synthetic pathway with an MIC value of 12.6 mM, comparable to that of positive control abyssomicin C,
representing a new example of the rare pAba pathway inhibitors.

Rumex species are widely distributed in China. Among these,
the roots of Rumex nepalensis Spreng. are traditionally used for the
treatment of pain, inflammation, bleeding, tinea, tumor, and
constipation in Chinese folkmedicine (Li, 1998; Zhang et al., 2008),
and the roots of Rumex hastatus are of medicinal significance for
cough, headache, and fever (Editorial Commission of China, 1998).
Previous studies revealed the presence of sterols in R. nepalensis
and anthraquinones in R. hastatus (Khetwal et al., 1987; Tiwari and
Sinha, 1980). During our search for bioactive metabolites from
Rumex plants, we have reported several anthraquinones, naphtha-
lenes, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds from R. nepalensis
and R. hastatus (Mei et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Further study
on the roots of R. nepalensis has resulted in the isolation of two new
naphthalene acylglucosides, designated rumexneposides A (1) and
B (2), together with 12 known compounds (3–14) (Fig. 1).
Compounds 1–14 together with previously isolated compounds
from R. nepalensis and R. hastus (15–25) (Mei et al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2009) were screened for a broad spectrum of activities,* Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 871 5223048; fax: +86 871 5223048.

2. Results and discussion
The EtOH extracts of R. nepalensis roots were successively
partitioned with petroleum ether, EtOAc, and H2O. From the
EtOAC-soluble fraction, two new (1 and 2) and 12 known
compounds were isolated. The known compounds were identified
as physcion (3) (Zhang et al., 2006), chrysophanol-8-O-b-D-
glucopyranoside (4) (Yuan et al., 2000), torachrysone (5) (Demir-
ezer et al., 2001), emodin-8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (6) (Zhang
et al., 2005), emodin-8-O-b-D-(60-O-acetyl)glucopyranoside (7) (Qi
et al., 2005), chrysophanol (8) (Yan et al., 2001), emodin (9) (Zhang
et al., 2005), citreorosein (10) (Xiang et al., 2001), resveratrol (11)
(Sethi et al., 1980), nepodin-8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (12)
(Demirezer et al., 2001), torachrysone-8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside
(13) (Lemli et al., 1981), and chrysophanol-8-O-b-D-(60-O-acet-
yl)glucopyranoside (14) (Shi et al., 2001) based on comparisons
with data in the literature.
Rumexneposide A (1) was obtained as a yellow powder and its
molecular formula was deduced to be C23H26O9 on the basis of its
negative high-resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectros-Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The infrared (IR) spectrum showed absorption bands representa-
tive of hydroxyl (3414 cm1) and carbonyl groups (1721 and
1698 cm1). The 1H nuclearmagnetic resonance (NMR) data (Table
1) exhibited three methyls (dH 2.48, s; 2.25, s; 1.94, d, J = 6.6 Hz),
four aromatic protons (dH 6.97, s; 7.21, brd, J = 8.1 Hz; 7.03, dd,
J = 8.1, 7.6 Hz; 6.70, brd, J = 7.6 Hz), and a sugar moiety (dH 2.71–
4.46; 4.19, d, J = 7.2 Hz, H-10). The 13CNMRdata (Table 1)were very
similar to those of nepodin-8-O-b-D-glucopyrancoside (Demirezer
et al., 2001). However, two additional olefinic carbons (dC 122.4,
145.4), one carbonyl (dC 166.2), and one methyl group (dC 18.1)
were observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 1, which indicate the
presence of a crotonoyl group in the molecule. The heteronuclear
multiple bond correlations (HMBCs) of H-200 and H-300 with C-100,
and H-400 with C-200 and C-300 confirmed the presence of such a
moiety. The trans configurations of H-200 and H-300 were concluded
from the J value (15.5 Hz) of H-200. The HMBC of H-60 with C-100
indicated attachment of the trans-crotonoyl group to C-60. Acid
hydrolysis of 1 with 2% HCl–dioxane (1:1, v/v) produced D-glucose
as the sugar residue, determined by gas chromatography (GC)
analysis. Therefore, the structure of 1 was assigned as nepodin-8-
O-b-D-(60-O-trans-crotonoyl)glucopyranoside.
Rumexneposide B (2) was obtained as a yellow powder and its
molecular formula was deduced to be C22H26O10 by negative

400 1.94 (d, 6.6) 18.1 (q)spectrum showed absorption bands attributable to hydroxyls
(3422 cm1) and carbonyls (1734 and 1715 cm1). The 1H and 3C
NMR data (Table 1) were very similar to those of 5, except that one
additional acetyl signal (dC 171.5, 20.5) was observed in the
13C
NMR spectrum of 2. This was confirmed by the observed HMBC
interaction of H-200 with C-100. The further HMBC of H-60 with C-100
indicates that the acetyl group is attached to C-60. In the same
manner as used for 1, acid hydrolysis of 2 with 2% HCl–dioxane
(1:1, v/v) produced D-glucose as the sugar residue, determined by
GC analysis. Therefore, the structure of 2 was assigned as
torachrysone-8-O-b-D-(60-O-acetyl)glucopyranoside.
Notably, compounds 1, 2, 7, and 14 all have an acyl group on the
sugar moiety, which may be characteristic of the compounds from
R. nepalensis. Compounds 7, 10, 11, 13, and 14 were also isolated
from this plant for the first time.
Considering the traditional medical uses of Rumex plants,
compounds 1–25 were examined for their inhibitory effects on
infection- and tumor-associated targets, such as M. tuberculosis,
pAba biosynthetic pathway, and a panel of human cancer cell lines.
In an anti-tuberculosis assay, the results showed that com-
pound 1, 5, and 12–16 exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards
M. tuberculosis, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
values of 20.7, 6.1, 26.6, 8.9, 4.1, 2.85, and 10.2mM, respectively,
when isoniazid was used as the positive control (MIC: 2.04 mM),
whereas the other compounds showed no activity (MIC > 40 mM)
(data not shown).
The pAba pathway exists in plants, algae, bacteria, fungi, and
parasites, but not in mammals. Therefore, this pathway is
considered to be an attractive target for the development of
new chemotherapeutic agents (McConkey, 1999; Roberts et al.,
1998). However, until now, only abyssomicin C, a marine natural
product, has been reported to inhibit pAba biosynthesis (Riedlinger
et al., 2004). Because the roots of R. nepalensis are renowned for the
treatment of tinea, the metabolites isolated from this material
together with previously isolated compounds (Mei et al., 2009)
were screened for their effects on pAba biosynthesis. Our results
show that 5 has significant inhibitory activity on the pAba
pathway, with an MIC value of 12.6 mM (3.1mg/mL), similar to
that of abyssomicin C (the MIC value of abyssomicin C in MP
medium is 8.3mM, used as a positive control in this study). Other
compounds, including analogues of 5, showed no inhibitory effects
at concentrations of up to 30 mg/mL (data not shown). Like
abyssomicin C, thismolecule represents another pAba biosynthesis
pathway inhibitor.
A cytotoxic assay of all the compounds was performed against
five cancer cell lines (A549, H522, MCF-7, MCF-10A, and SKBR3)
using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method, with cisplatin as the positive control.
Compounds 1, 11, 14, and 17 showed different cytotoxicities
towards the five cancer cell lines (Table 2), but the other
compounds showed no cytotoxic effects at concentrations of up
to 40 mM. Compound 1, in particular, showed activity against a
broad spectrum of human cancer cells, including lung and breast
cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of 14 was cell-type-dependent, and
of the five cell lines tested, only MCF-10A cancer cells responded
to 14.
In this study, we isolated and characterized 2 new naphthalene
acylglucosides and 12 known compounds from R. nepalensis roots.
We evaluated the biological activities of 25 compounds, including
11 previously reported compounds from R. nepalensis and R.
hastatus, against M. tuberculosis, pAba pathway, and 5 human
cancer cell lines. Several compounds showed good activity against
M. tuberculosis, of which compound 15was themost active, with an
MIC similar to that of isoniazid. Compound 5 was a potent pAba
synthetic pathway inhibitor, representing another example of the
rare pAba pathway inhibitors. Although most compounds showed

3. Experimental
3.1. General experimental procedures
Melting points were determined with an XRC-1 micromelting
apparatus. Optical rotations were determined with a JASCO-20C
digital polarimeter. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-
2401PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were obtained with a
Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer with KBr pellets. NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 or a DRX-500
spectrometer. Electron impact mass spectrometry (EIMS) (70 eV)
and FABMS were recorded on a VG Auto Spec-3000 spectrometer.
The silica gel (200–300 mesh and 1–40mm) for column
chromatography (CC) and GF254 for thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) were obtained from the Qingdao Marine Chemical Factory,
Qingdao, China. Sephadex LH-20 was obtained from Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. The fractions were monitored by TLC
and the spots were visualized after spraying with 10% NaOH in
EtOH or anisaldehyde reagents, followed by heating.
3.2. Plant material
R. nepalensis roots were collected in the suburb of Kunming,
Yunnan Province, China, in July 2006. The voucher specimen (no.
CHYX0183) authenticated by Prof. Yun-Heng Ji in our institution
was deposited at the State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry andPlant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany,
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
3.3. Extraction and isolation
The dried roots of R. nepalensis (15 kg, powdered) were
extracted with 95% EtOH (3  30 L) under reflux and concentrated
in vacuo to produce a crude extract, which was suspended in water
and then successively partitioned with petroleum ether (3  3 L)
and EtOAc (3  3 L). The EtOAC extract (488 g) was subjected to CC
over silica gel (200–300 mesh, 5 kg) and eluted with a gradient of
CHCl3–MeOH (100:0, 98:2, 96:4, 94:6, 90:10, 85:15, 80:20, 70:30)
to produce fractions A–G. Fraction C (26 g) was subjected to silica
gel CC elutedwith a gradient of CHCl3–Me2CO (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1) to
produce three fractions (fr. C.1–3). Fraction C.2 was subjected to
Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) chromatography and repeated vacuum
liquid chromatography (VLC) over silica gel to yield 1 (31 mg) and
13 (187 mg). Fraction D (22 g) was subjected to silica gel CC with a
gradient of CHCl3–Me2CO (150:1, 120:1, 100:1, 80:1, 40:1, 20:1),
followed by gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH), MCI Gel1
CHP20P chromatography (MeOH–H2O, 9:1), and repeated VLC
(silica gel) to produce 2 (32 mg), 3 (17 mg), 4 (104 mg), 8 (34 mg),
and 9 (75 mg). Fraction E (29 g) was fractionated by MCI Gel1
CHP20P chromatography, eluted with a gradient of MeOH–H2O
(3:7, 5:5, 7:3, 1:0), followed by Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) filtration,
to produce 7 (20 mg), 10 (35 mg), 11 (76 mg), 12 (41 mg), and 14
(76 mg). The combined chromatography of fraction F by silica gel
CC (CHCl3–MeOH, 100:0, 80:1, 60:1, 40:1, 20:1) and Sephadex LH-
20 (MeOH) chromatography yielded 5 (136 mg). Compound 6
(21 mg) was purified from fraction G (23 g) by silica gel CC (CHCl3–
MeOH, 40:1, 30:1, 15:1, 10:1, 6:1, 4:1, 2:1) and gel filtration over
Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH).

3.6. Acid hydrolysis of 1 or 2
Compound 1 or 2 (5 mg each) was refluxed with 2% HCl–
dioxane (1:1, v/v, 4 mL) in a water bath (80 8C) for 6 h. The
reaction mixture was then evaporated to dryness, and parti-
tioned between CHCl3 and H2O. The aqueous layer was
neutralized with Amberlite IRA-401 resin (OH form). The
filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The sugar residue was
diluted in 2 mL of pyridine and treated with 1.5 mL of L-cysteine
methyl ester hydrochloride at 60 8C for 1 h, and then treated
with 1.5 mL of trimethylsilylimidazole at 60 8C for 30 min. The
supernatant was analyzed by GC under the conditions: 30QC/

H.-X. Liang et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 3 (2010) 181–1841843.7. Assay for anti-M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) in its logarithmic growth
phase
M. tuberculosis (MTB) assays were carried using a constitutive
green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector (pUV3583c–
GFP) with the direct fluorescence readout as a measure of bacterial
growth (Chan et al., 2002). The production of GFP by replicating
cells as a marker of live cells has been shown to result in the same
MIC as thatmeasured by the direct enumeration of colony-forming
units (cfu) for all front-line antituberculosis agents (Changsen
et al., 2003). Briefly, MTB was grown in 50 mL of 7H9 broth (Difco)
containing 0.05% Tween 80 and 25mg/mL kanamycin. The cultures
were incubated at 37 8C with rotary agitation, grown to mid-
exponential phase (optical density at 595 nm [OD595] of approxi-
mately 0.6–0.8), and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets
were resuspended in a small amount of enriched 7H9medium. The
starter culture was grown to an OD595 of 0.3–0.5 and then diluted
with 7H9 medium to an OD595 of approximately 0.05 (1.5  104
cells). The compounds were prepared at 100  stocks in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Six serial dilutions of the compounds were
prepared in the same solvent and added to the wells in a 2 mL
volume. Isoniazid (purchased from Sigma) was used as the positive
control for theMTB assay.Wells containing only the carrier solvent
were the negative controls. Each well received 80 mL of the diluted
bacterial culture. The plate was incubated at 37 8C with gentle
agitation, and the OD600 and fluorescence were read at intervals of
24 h for three days using an EnVision 2103 multilabel reader
(PerkinElmer, USA) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at
508 nm.
3.8. Assay for the inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway from
chorismate to pAba
Inhibition was determined according to the previously de-
scribed method (Riedlinger et al., 2004), with some modification.
Bacillus subtilisATCC 66333was grown on an agar plate onminimal
medium (MM) consisting of glucose 0.5%, tri-sodium citrate2H2O
0.05%, KH2PO4 0.3%, K2HPO4 0.7%, MgSO47H2O 0.01%, and
(NH4)2SO4 0.1% in deionized water. The B. subtilis strain was also
grown in MP medium (MM medium supplemented with 5 mM
pAba). Aliquots (2mL) of the compounds dissolved in DMSO were
transferred to flat-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner,
Germany), to which were added 80 mL of solutions diluted with
MM or MP medium to a final concentration of 1  105 cfu/mL. The
assay plates were incubated overnight in a 37 8C incubator. The
MIC was determined with a broth microdilution protocol. The OD
of the overnight culture was determined at 595 nm using an
EnVision 2103 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer). Abyssomicin C (a
kind gift from Prof. Michael Goodfellow and purified by high-
performance liquid chromatography) was used as the positive
control. In an assay for the inhibition of pAba biosynthesis, theMIC
value of abyssomicin C in MP medium was 8.3 mM. Active
compounds showed selective antibacterial activity against the test
organism grown on MM medium, but no activity was observed
when the test organism was grown on MP medium.
3.9. Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of the compounds for A549 (human non-small-
cell lung cancer), SKBR3, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and H522 cells (non-
small-cell lung carcinoma) was measured. The cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
newborn calf serum, penicillin (50 units/mL), and streptomycin
(50 mg/mL) in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 8C. The
cells were seeded in 96-well microplates (1–2  104 cells/well)and cultured for 12 h. The medium was replaced with one
containing the test compounds, and the cells were further cultured
at 37 8C. To evaluate the IC50 of all the compounds, the cells were
exposed to the test compounds at various concentrations. After
incubation for 48 h, 10 mL of MTT solution (Sigma) was added to
each well and the cells were incubated under the same conditions
for 4 h until a purple precipitate was visible. DMSO (200mL) was
added and the optical density was measured at 570 nm in a
microplate reader (Bio-Tek Synergy HT). Cisplatin and DMSO were
used as the positive and negative controls, respectively.
