ScoGIN AND DAVID A. YouNG Rancho Santa Amt Botanic Garden and Claremont Graduate School, Claremont, California 91711 Lotus corniculatus L. has been the object of numerous chemical investi-gations analyzing its flavonoid ( Har borne, 1971) and triterpenoid (Walter, 1961 ) constituents and its seed proteins ( Lester, 1968). No previous report has noted the presence of anthocyanins in this plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS Lotus corniculatus flowers were collected l mi S of Stewart's Point on U.S. Highway 1, Sonoma Co., Calif. ( Young 1246; voucher deposited in RSA). Flower petals were extracted with MeOH and the extract was fil-tered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Concentrated extract was streaked on Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper sheets and subjected to one-dimensional paper chromatography utilizing the BA W solvent system ( n-butanol, acetic acid, water: 4,1,5). Visually apparent anthocyanin-containing bands were cut out, eluted with MeOH, and the purified com-pound was used for subsequent chromatographic studies. Acid hydrolysis of the glycone was in 6% aqueous HCl at 100 C for 4-5 hr. Solvent systems used : 15% HOAc-HCl (3% HCl in aqueous 15% acetic acid); Bu-HCl (n-butanol, 2N HCI: 1,1- upper phase used ) and TBA (tertiary butyl alcohol, acetic acid, water: 3,1,l). RESULTS A single anthocyanin was detected in extracts of L. corniculatus upon initial chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of this compound yielded del-phinidin. R1 values for the compound in various solvent systems are shown in Table l with values for awobanin from the literature where available. Chromatographic properties of the L. corniculatus anthocyanin show it to be awobanin [ delphinidin 3-( 0-p-coumaroylglucosido )-5-glucoside]. DISCUSSION The occurrence of anthocyanins in the Leguminosae has been reviewed recently by Harborne ( 1971 ) . Adinarayana and Seshadri ( 1966) noted 6-alkylated pelargonidin-3-sophoroside in the petals of Cassia marginata Sesse & Moc. The present communication constitutes the second report of the occurrence of an alkylated anthocyanin in the Legurninosae. 273 274 ALISO [VoL. 8, No. 3 TABLE 1.

The compound awobanin has been studied as the metallo-anthocyanin complex, commelinin ( Mitsui, Hayashi, and Hattori, 1959) from its only other reported source, Commelina communis L. ( Kuroda, 1936 ) . The present communication is the first report of any anthocyanin from the genus Lotus and, in view of the unusual nature of this compound, the value of a more thorough survey of additional Lotus species and related genera is indicated.
