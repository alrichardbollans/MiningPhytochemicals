The synthesis of 2 from cnicin (1), via the epoxide 3,confirmed the structure and stereochemistry of malacitanolide, as well as its biogeneticrelationship with 1. Cytotoxic activity values for 2 are significantly higher than for 1.Centaurea malacitana Boiss. (Compositae) containscnicin (1) and other cytotoxic and antimicrobial germac-ranolides1 that are useful for the semisynthesis of (+)-vernolepin related compounds.2 Further investigationof the extract of C. malacitana led to the isolation ofmalacitanolide (2), a new eudesmanolide with potentcytotoxic activity, and 8-O-(4-acetoxyangeloyl)saloniteno-lide,3 here described for the second time in nature.The molecular formula of malacitanolide (2) isC20H26O8 as deduced from its HRCIMS. Its IR spectrumshowed bands due to hydroxyl, aldehyde, ä-lactone, andR,â-unsaturated ester groups. In the CIMS, peaks atm/z 281 [M + H - C5H6O3]+, 263 [M + H - C5H8O4]+,and 115 [C5H7O3]+ were indicative of a five-carbon-atomdihydroxylated-ester side chain. The 1H-NMR spectrumshowed signals confirming the presence, at C-8, of thesame side chain that occurs in 1.1 However, thechemical shift of H-14 (0.93 ppm) was the usual one foreudesmanolides.4 The 13C-NMR spectrum confirmedthe eudesmanolide skeleton.5 Additionally, the 1H-NMRspectrum showed signals (ä 3.42 and 2.82), which couldbe justified if an equatorial hydroxyl group was locatedat C-1 and an axial formyl group was present at C-4.Chemical shift and multiplicity of H-15 confirmed theâ axial orientation of the aldehyde.4 The couplingconstants between H-5, H-6, H-7, and H-8 were the onesexpected if they all had axial orientations. These datasuggested structure 2 for malacitanolide. Several NOEexperiments confirmed the relative configuration of 2and the position and preferential conformation of theformyl group (Scheme 1).A biogenetic precursor of malacitanolide (2) could becnicin (1), which, after enzymatic epoxidation, ste-reospecific transannular cyclization of the 1,10-epoxide,and hydride shift, would yield 2. In order to supportthis hypothesis and to confirm the structure of malaci-tanolide, chemical synthesis of 2 from 1 was performed(Scheme 1). Treatement of 1 with m-CPBA, in thepresence of pyridine, led to the oxirane 3. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 3, H-1 appeared at ä 2.89 (dd) andthe Me-14 at ä 1.25 (s), the expected values consideringthe presence of epoxide carbons at C-1 and C-10.6 The1â,10R stereochemistry of the epoxide was proposedconsidering the preferential conformation of germacra-nolides,7 the reaction mechanism of m-CPBA, and thecoupling constants of H-1. When 1 was treated withm-CPBA without pyridine, malacitanolide was directlyobtained. Apparently, m-chlorobenzoic acid, formedduring the epoxidation reaction, was responsible for theelectrophilic opening and subsequent rearrangement ofepoxide 3 (Scheme 1). As the absolute configuration of(+)-cnicin (1) has been reported,8 the synthesis of (+)-malacitanolide (2) from 1 confirms the absolute config-uration of 2 and supports its biogenetic relationshipwith cnicin.In vitro cytotoxic activity of 2 was assayed9 towardsthe P-388, SCHABEL, A-549, HT-29, and MEL-28tumor cell lines. Malacitanolide (2) showed IC50 ) 3.05 10-7 M in the five cases. Previously reported IC50values for cnicin (1) were 6.6 10-6 M against the P-388cells and 1.32  10-5 M towards both the A-549 andHT-29 lines.1 It is generally accepted that the cytotoxicactivity of the sesquiterpene lactones resides chiefly ontheir Michael acceptor groups.10 However, although 2and 1 have identical Michael acceptor groups, 2 has anactivity twenty to forty times higher than 1 towards theP-388, A-549, and HT-29 lines. This increase in activitycould be due either to the new functionalization patternor to the higher molecular rigidity.Eperimental SectionGeneral Experimental Procedures.
