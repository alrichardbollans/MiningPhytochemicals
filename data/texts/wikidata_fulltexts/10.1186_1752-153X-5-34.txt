Abstract
Background: The St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum; Clusiaceae) has been used in traditional and modern
medicine for a long time due to its high content of biologically active phenolics. The purpose of this work was to
develop a method for their fractionation and identification, and to determine the most active antioxidant
compounds in plant extract.
Results: An LC-MS method which enables fast qualitative and semiquantitative analysis was developed. The
composition determined is in agreement with the previous results, where 6 flavonoids, 4 naphthodianthrones and
4 phloroglucinols have been identified. Significant antioxidant activity was determined for most of the fractions by
DPPH assay (the lowest IC50 of 0.52 μg/ml), NO scavenging (6.11 μg/ml), superoxide scavenging (1.86 μg/ml), lipid
peroxidation (0.0079 μg/ml) and FRAP (the highest reduction capacity of 104 mg Fe equivalents/g) assays.
Conclusion: LC-MS technique has been successfully applied for a quick separation and identification of the major
components of H. perforatum fractions. Majority of the fractions analyzed have expressed a very high antioxidative
activity when compared to synthetic antioxidants. The antioxidant activity could be attributed to flavonoids and
phenolic acids, while phloroglucinols and naphthodianthrones showed no significant activity. It is demonstrated
that it is possible to obtain, by fractionation, H. perforatum preparations with significantly increased phloroglucinols-
to-naphthodianthrones ratio (up to 95:5).
Background
Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John’s wort) is a represen-
tative of the Clusiaceae family with confirmed therapeu-
tic effects on burns, bruises, swelling, anxiety, mild to
moderate depression [1], antidepressant, antiviral,
wound healing, analgesic, hepatoprotective, antioxidant
and antimicrobial activity [2-5]. Hyperforin is believed
to be the major constituent responsible for the antide-
pressant activity, although discrepancies in the dose-
response relationship imply that other constituents are
also involved [6]. Naphthodianthrones, especially hyperi-
cin-like compounds, are shown to posses a strong anti-
viral effect [7]. Flavonoids are of a special interest due
to their antioxidative properties i.e. excellent radical
scavenging ability [6].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in
pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer, muta-
genesis, Alzheimer’s, AIDS, etc. [8]. Many synthetic anti-
oxidants are currently in use; nevertheless, there is a
growing evidence of consumer preference for natural
antioxidants because of their potentially lower toxicity.
H. perforatum extracts are already proven to inhibit
lipid peroxidation in vivo [5].
Previous results [9] demonstrated that H. perforatum
fractions, obtained by successive liquid-liquid extractions
with solvents of different polarities, have different epi-
leptic activities (ranging from inhibitory to stimulatory),
and that this approach can point out to compounds
responsible for pharmacological activity. In this work
eight fractions of H. perforatum, obtained by an exter-
nally developed method of fractionation devised to sepa-
rate main constituents of the plant, were examined. The
chemical composition of all extracts has been analyzed
by rapid-resolution liquid chromatography, as opposed
to the previously used classical high-performance liquid
chromatography [10-18]. Antioxidant activity has been

thetic antioxidants BHT (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyto-
luene) and BHA (2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole) were
used as standards. An attempt was made to correlate
chemical composition of the extracts with its antioxi-
dant activity and determine which group of biomole-
cules is the most potent.
Results
LC-MS analysis
LC-MS technique has been successfully applied for a
quick separation and identification of the major compo-
nents of H. perforatum fractions. Detected compounds
are representatives of three groups: flavonoids, naphtho-
dianthrones and phloroglucinols.
Peaks identification was done by comparing the mass
spectra and retention times with already published data
[17]. Four naphthodianthrones (protopseudohypericin,
pseudohypericin, protohypericin and hypericin) and four
phloroglucinols (hyperfirin, adhyperfirin, hyperforin,
adhyperforin) were identified together with several flavo-
noids (hyperoside, rutin, quercitrin and quercetin) and a
small amount of caffeoylquinic acid (Table 1). The
grouping of compounds by classes is observed, with fla-
vonoids and phenolic acids eluting between 0 and 2.5
min, naphthodianthrones in 2.5-4.7 min, and phloroglu-
cinols in 4.7-6.5 min interval (Figure 1). The relative
abundance of each group is determined by the normali-
zation method, as an area percent of all peaks with simi-
lar spectra eluting within a given retention time range
(Table 2). It is important to note that area percents,
although useful for the comparison of the fractions’ pur-
ity, neither directly correspond to the percentage com-
position in weight or amount, nor account for the total
content of the compounds. Since there were no refer-
ence standards available, total peak areas (divided by the
injected mass of extract) were used as a measure of the
absolute content of the separate compound classes.
Antioxidant activity
All fractions were subjected to the antioxidant activity
assays, with results given in Table 3. Activities varied
widely, from very high to moderate. All samples demon-
strated ability to scavenge DPPH radicals, where most of
them had IC50 value lower than the synthetic antioxi-
dants BHT and BHA, except the fraction I/4. Superox-
ide anion scavenging was also observed, with IC50 values
in range 1.86-32.4 μg/mL (the most active being I/2 and
the least active I/5). Under the same experimental con-
ditions, synthetic antioxidants BHT and BHA did not
reach 50% inhibition due to their low solubility in the
reaction medium (water). Inhibition of lipid peroxida-
tion by extract fractions was also demonstrated, with
IC50 higher (i.e. lower activity) than the synthetic antiox-
idants. Most of the fractions have shown scavenger
activity in neutralizing NO radical. For fractions I/2 and

neutralization of 50% NO radicals was not accomplished
even with the highest concentrations of 22 μg/mL and
120 μg/mL, respectively. Under the experimental condi-
tions, synthetic antioxidants BHT and BHA did not
reach 50% inhibition due to their low solubility in water.
Discussion
It has already been demonstrated [10,17,19] that Hyperi-
cum perforatum extracts contain several classes of plant
phenolics with a documented biological activity, including
antidepressant phloroglucinols (hyperforin and its deriva-
tive adhyperforin), antiviral, antibacterial and photosensi-
tizing naphthodianthrones (hypericin and pseudohypericin,
as well as their precursors - protohypericin and protopseu-
dohypericin), antioxidant flavonoids (mostly quercetin and
kaempferol glycosides and aglycones, as well as biflavo-
noids), and phenolic acids (mostly isomeric caffeoylquinic
acids). For the purpose of pharmaceutical products
production, the preparation of the enriched extracts may
be of interest. In this paper, it has been demonstrated that
it is possible to obtain extracts with high levels of phloro-
glucinols (I/4) and naphthodianthrones (I/5) by using a
relatively simple procedure.
The antioxidant activity of H. perforatum extracts is
well known [4,20] and is to be expected due to a high
content of phenolic compounds. Although several publi-
cations were focused on this topic [21,22], there is still a
lack of conclusive evidence to determine which pheno-
lics class is the most responsible for the antioxidant
activity of Hypericum plants. Since the procedure
described in this paper enabled the isolation of extract
fractions enriched in different groups of phenolics, it
was possible to establish the correlation between the
extract composition and activity, and to distinguish
structural features most important for scavenging and
antioxidant properties. In addition, synergistic action of
certain compounds is also to be expected.

Page 3 of 8Since it is now recognized that there is no single test
to evaluate antioxidant activities of the compounds with
wide spectra of structures, modes of action, and physical
and chemical properties [23], several different assays
were employed as a part of our investigation.
DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) is a stable radi-
cal and is often used in assessment of the antioxidant
activity. The free radical DPPH possesses a characteristic
absorption at 517 nm (purple in color), which decreases
significantly when exposed to radical-scavengers (due to
hydrogen atoms transfer from antioxidant to DPPH). A
lower absorbance at 517 nm indicates a higher radical-
scavenging activity of extract [24]. In this assay, the abil-
ity of the investigated H. perforatum fractions to act as
donors of hydrogen atoms or electrons in transforma-
tion of DPPH radical into its reduced form DPPH-H
was investigated.
The activity observed is in a very good correlation
with the composition, where the most active fractions
are those rich in flavonoid glycosides (followed by min-
ute amounts of phenolic acids) and poor in biflavonoids
( a m e n t o f l a v o n e ,b i a p i g e n i n ) :I / 2 ,I I / 2 pa n dI I / 2 s .A s
opposed to this, fractions with high biflavonoids level
and low flavonoid glycosides content (I/3, I/5) exhibited
significantly lower activity (i.e. higher IC50 values), and
fraction I-4, practically devoid of flavonoids and pheno-
lic acids, was the least active. It is notable that only fla-
vonoid glycosides (with quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
galactoside and rhamnoside as the most abundant) seem
to contribute significantly to radical-scavenging activity
(given as 1/IC50), with Pearson’s correlation coefficient r
= 0.778 (0.922 if the outlier - II/2p - is excluded),
together with phenolic acids (r = 0.769, or 0.929 without
II/2p). These observations are only partially in agree-
ment with the previous results [21]. While it would be
expected for flavonoid aglycones to be more active than
their 3-O-glycosides [23], no correlation was found
between aglycones content and antioxidant activity as
determined by DPPH test, and the activity of fractions
I/3 and I/5 (rich in flavonoid and biflavonoid aglycones,
poor in glycosides and phenolic acids) is low.
At the same time, no correlation was found between
activity and content of naphthodianthrones and phloro-
glucinols, which is in accordance with the results of
Silva et al. [23]. The low activity of biflavonoids present
in Hypericum perforatum extracts was already documen-
ted [22] and is to be expected. These compounds, being
dimers of apigenin, possess only 4’-hydroxyl on B-ring,
while it is known that for maximum activity a catechol
structure (3’,4’-dihydroxylated benzene moiety), as pre-
sent in quercetin, is required [21-23,25].
FRAP test is based on nonspecific reduction of Fe
3
+-TPTZ into the blue Fe
2+-TPTZ by the extract, which
leads to an increased absorbance at 593 nm. Results are
presented as mg of Fe
2+/1 g of dried fraction and repre-
sent the mass of Fe
3+ that can be reduced by 1 g of H.
perforatum fraction. Several important facts should be
kept in mind when interpreting results of the test. First,
it measures ability of a sample to participate in one-elec-
tron redox reactions, meaning that antioxidants with dif-
ferent mode of action (e.g. carotenoids, behaving as
radical scavengers) will not be ignored. Second, only
water-soluble antioxidants will react since the assay is
performed in aqueous solution. Third, the reduction
capacity determined in the absence of biomolecules as
substrates does not necessarily reflect the antioxidant
activity i.e. protective capabilities. Still, it can be a rele-
vant factor in detoxification of reactive species such as
HOCl and ONOO
- [26].
FRAP test has shown that H. perforatum fractions
have the significant reduction potential, with fractions I/
1, I/2 and II/2p being more active than the synthetic
antioxidant BHT. Taking into account the results of
HPLC analysis, reduction capacity may be attributed
mostly to the content of phenolic acids and flavonoid
glycosides (although Pearson’s correlation coefficients
are quite low, 0.768 and 0.584, respectively). The contri-
bution of phloroglucinols to the total reduction capacity
is negligible - two fractions rich in these compounds, I/
4 and I/3, exhibited the lowest capacity of all the sam-
ples examined. Their inactivity can be explained by the
lack of easily oxidizable functional groups (such as phe-
nolic moiety). The low activity is also observed for
naphthodianthrones and biflavonoids, fractions with
especially high content of these compounds (I/3, II/3, I/
4, I/5) having the lowest reduction capacity.
In superoxide anion test the ability of H. perforatum
fractions to neutralize superoxide anion radical (O2
-)
was evaluated. While superoxide is intentionally pro-
d u c e db ys o m ec e l l s( p h a g o cytes) in order to combat
infection, its presence is usually deleterious to organism,
leading (if not degraded by superoxide dismutase) to
degenerative processes and death. In the employed
assay, O2
- anion was generated in situ, by electron-
transfer from NADH to O2 present in solution (a pro-
cess analogous to NADPH oxidase- and NADH dehy-
drogenase-catalyzed generation in vivo) [20].
All investigated extract fractions exhibited dose-
dependent O2
- scavenging activity. The weakest activity
was again observed in samples rich in biflavonoids,
naphthodianthrones and phloroglucinols but with low
levels of other phenolics - I/4 and I/5. A high degree of
correlation was found between the activity (expressed as
1/IC50) and the content of phenolic acids (r = 0.857),
flavonoid aglycones (r = 0.791, without the outlier I/5: r
= 0.926), and sum of phenolic acids, flavonoid aglycones
and glycosides (r = 0.883, or 0.921 without fraction I/5).
These observations are in agreement with the empirical
Orčić et al. Chemistry Central Journal 2011, 5:34
http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/5/1/34
Page 4 of 8rule that a catechol moiety (present both in quercetin
and in caffeoylquinic acid) is required for a maximum
radical-scavenging activity [21-23,25].
One of the main detrimental effects of reactive radical
species (especially OH·) is lipid peroxidation (LP) i.e.
oxidative degradation of lipids, leading to biological
membranes damage and, possibly, to cell death or for-
mation of mutagenic/carcinogenic products. The best
known LP product is malondialdehyde (MDA) and it
has been used most widely as a biomarker in various
studies associated with lipid peroxidation. Determination
of MDA may be problematic because of its high reactiv-
ity and water solubility, and it is therefore necessary to
generate stable derivatives. One of the most commonly
used is thiobarbituric acid adduct, which can be deter-
mined using spectrophotometry. In our research, linseed
oil was used as a substrate for LP due to its high con-
tent of polyunsaturated fatty acids. LP of polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids was triggered by Fe
2+ and ascorbate
(which, through Fenton reaction, generate OH· radicals)
[27].
All samples were able to inhibit lipid peroxidation in a
dose-dependent manner, although not as efficient as
synthetic antioxidants BHT and BHA. It is notable that
fraction I/4, by far the poorest in flavonoids and pheno-
lic acids and one of the least active in DPPH, FRAP,
superoxide scavenging and NO scavenging assays, exhib-
ited very strong LP-inhibiting activity, matched only by
I/1. On the other hand, fraction II/2p, among the most
active in mentioned assays, was second-to-weakest in
this assay. It was not possible to correlate the test
results with chemical composition of fractions. These
results are in disagreement with those of Silva et al.
[21], which implied flavonoids as main anti-LP constitu-
ents of Hypericum perforatum extracts.
It should be noted that the effects of plant phenolics
on Fe
2+/ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation are com-
plex. It is known that flavonoids, especially those with
catechol-like substitution on B ring and either 4-oxo-3-
hydroxy or 4-oxo-5-xydroxy, are efficient in inhibiting
LP, both through radical scavenging and through chela-
tion of iron ions. On the other hand, in the presence of
transition metal ions, flavonoids also exhibit pro-oxidant
effect [27], continuously reducing these ions and thus
enabling them to generate OH· via Fenton reaction.
Biflavonoids, while being very poor radical scavengers,
are proven to inhibit LP with similar potency as flavo-
noid glycosides, probably through iron chelation [22],
while naphthodianthrones and phloroglucinols are not
active [21].
Finally, nitric oxide scavenging ability was also assayed
for all fractions. While NO is normally produced in
organism as a messenger and as a part of immune
response, its reaction with O2
- produces highly reactive
peroxynitrite that can damage various biomolecules.
Thus, the ability of extracts to neutralize NO and
ONOO
- can have beneficial effects.
While all investigated extract fractions demonstrated
dose-dependent scavenging of NO, for most of them
IC50 values were high (or, in the case of I/2 and I/4,
50% neutralization was not accomplished within the
examined concentration range). As with lipid peroxida-
tion assay, it was not possible to attribute the NO
scavenging activity to any particular class of phenolics.
Conclusion
In conclusion, by using fractionation combined with
assays and LC-MS analysis, it was possible to identify
compound classes responsible for H. perforatum antioxi-
dant activity. It was demonstrated that it can mostly be
attributed to flavonoid glycosides and phenolic acids
(chlorogenic acid), while phloroglucinols (lacking poly-
phenolic structure), biflavonoids (lacking catechol moi-
ety) and naphthodianthrones showed no significant
activity.

(80% flowers and 20% rest of the plant). Plant material
was dried and powdered, and dried again at 105°C by
steam heating.
Extraction
The extraction and fractionation were performed using
third party-developed procedure (patent pending).
Dried and powdered plant material was depigmentated
using chloroform extraction for 96 h and, after
vacuum-drying, extracted for 72 h with eight-fold
amount of methanol. Both extractions were carried out
at temperatures near the boiling points of the respec-
tive solvents. The process yielded 6-7% of raw extract
on dry weight basis. After removal of carotenoids by
petroleum ether extraction and glycosides by ethyl
acetate/water partitioning, the residue was fractionated
using Sephadex LH-20 column to give five fractions
(based on colour and UV/VIS absorption spectra),
labelled I/1 to I/5 for the first batch of plant material,
and II/1 to II/5 for the second batch (of which, only
sub-fractions II/2s and II/2p, and fraction II/3 were
analyzed).
For the purpose of LC analysis and antioxidant assays,
all fractions were dissolved in methanol (except fraction
I/4, for which iso-propanol was used, due to low solubi-
lity in methanol).
LC-MS analysis
Chemical composition of fractions was determined by
rapid resolution liquid chromatography with mass selec-
tive detection, using Agilent Technologies 1200 Series
liquid chromatograph coupled with Agilent Technolo-
gies 6410B Series triple-quad (QQQ) mass spectrometer.
Components were separated using reversed-phase Zor-
b a xS B - C 1 83 0m m×2 . 1m m×3 . 5μmc o l u m n( A g i -

delivered in gradient mode (0 min 25% B, 6 min 100%
B, 8 min 100% B, solvent A being 0.1% aqueous formic
acid with 10 mmol/L CH3COONH4,a n ds o l v e n tB
being acetonitrile), with flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injection
volume was 1 μL, except for sample I/5, for which 0.1
μL was used to improve peak shape. Eluted components
were ionized by electrospray ion source (ESI), using N2
for nebulization (pressure of 35 psi) and drying (flow of
9 L/min, temperature of 350°C). Capillary voltage was
4000 V and fragmentor voltage 80 V. To increase the
sensitivity, lower the noise, and simplify the spectra,
negative ionization was used. Generated [M-H]
- ions
were analyzed using MS2Scan mode, in m/z range 200-
800 Da.
DPPH assay
Selected concentrations (ranging 0.001-12 mg/mL) of H.
perforatum fractions (10 μL) were mixed with 190 μLo f
methanol and 100 μL of methanolic solution containing
DPPH radicals (67.2 μmol/L). Absorption at 515 nm
was measured by the microplate reader (Multiskan
Spectrum, Thermo Corporation) after 60 min of incuba-
tion at room temperature. The radical-scavenging capa-
city (RSC) was calculated using the equation:
RSC =1 0 0−
(Aaverage − Acorr)
Acontrol
· 100
where Aaverage is absorbance of probe, at a given sam-
ple concentration level (average of three probes); Acorr is
the correction or the absorbance of the extract alone
(without reagents), and Acontrol is the absorbance of the
reagent (DPPH radical) without the extract. The extract
concentration in reaction mixture, resulting in 50% inhi-
bition of DPPH radicals (IC50), was calculated from the
RSC vs. extract concentration curve.
FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma)
Selected concentrations (ranging 0.001-12 mg/mL) of H.
perforatum fractions (10 μL) were treated with 300 μL
of FRAP reagent in triplicate. Correction (absorbance of
the untreated extract) and control (absorbance of the
FRAP reagent) were also measured. After 6 min of incu-
bation, the absorbance was measured at 593 nm by the
microplate reader (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo Cor-
poration). The calibration curve was constructed using
the aqueous solution of Fe
2+ in series of concentration
ranging 50-1000 μmol/L. The results were given as mg
of Fe
2+ per gram of dry extract.
Superoxide anion test
Selected concentrations (ranging 0.001-12 mg/mL) of H.
perforatum fractions (10 μL) were mixed with 40 μLo f
144 μmol/L NBT, 20 μL of 677 μmol/L NADH, 20 μL
of 60 μmol/L PMS and 220 μL of pH 8.3 buffer in tripli-
cate. Correction (absorbance of untreated extract) and
control (absorbance of reagents without extract) were
also measured. After 5 min of incubation absorbance
was measured at 560 nm by the microplate reader (Mul-
tiskan Spectrum, Thermo Corporation). The values of
RSC and IC50 were calculated in the same manner as in
DPPH test.
Inhibition of NO radical
Selected concentrations (ranging 0.001-12 mg/mL) of H.
perforatum fractions (10 μL) were mixed with 75 μLo f
SNP and 75 μL of phosphate buffer (0.067 mol/L, pH =
7.4) in triplicate. Correction (absorbance of untreated
extract) and control (absorbance of reagents without

under a fluorescent lamp for 1 h. After the incubation,
in each well 150 μL of Griess reagent was added and
the absorbance was measured at 546 nm by microplate
reader (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo Corporation). The
values of RSC and IC50 were calculated in the same
manner as in DPPH test.
Lipid peroxidation
As a substrate for lipid peroxidation, linseed oil (pre-
pared in-laboratory by hexane extraction of linseed)
was emulsified in phosphate buffer (0.035% v/v solu-
tion) with addition of Tween-80 (0.25% v/v solution)
as an emulsifier. Selected concentrations (ranging
0.0001-1.2 mg/mL) of H. perforatum fractions (10 μL),
each in triplicate, were mixed with 20 μL of 1.875
mmol/L FeSO4 and 20 μL of ascorbate (15.4 μg/mL).
The control and corrections were also made as pre-
viously defined. All probes were incubated at 37°C for
1 h, after which 200 μL of 0.1 mol/L EDTA was added
to bind the Fe
2+, thus stopping the reaction. TBA
reagent (2 mL) was added, and the mixture was heated
in boiling water bath for 15 min to form a stable,
colored derivative with MDA [28].
After that, probes were centrifuged for 15 min at 3700
rpm and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The
values of RSC and IC50 were calculated in the same
manner as in DPPH test.
