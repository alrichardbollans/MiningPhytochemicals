Abstract
Background: Recently, interest in phytochemicals from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with the capability to
inhibit cancer cells growth and proliferation has been growing rapidly due to their nontoxic nature. Dysosma
versipellis as Bereridaceae plants is an endemic species in China, which has been proved to be an important
Chinese herbal medicine because of its biological activity. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the
phytochemicals from Dysosma versipellis and their bioactivity are limited.
Results: Fifteen compounds were isolated and characterized from the roots of Dysosma versipellis, among which
six compounds were isolated from this plant for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were
investigated on tumor cells PC3, Bcap-37 and BGC-823 in vitro by MTT method, and the results showed that
podophyllotoxone (PTO) and 4’-demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin (DDPT) had potent inhibitory activities against the
growth of human carcinoma cell lines. Subsequent fluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that
these two compounds could induce apoptosis in PC3 and Bcap-37 cells, and the apoptosis ratios reached the peak
(12.0% and 14.1%) after 72 h of treatment at 20 μM, respectively.
Conclusions: This study suggests that most of the compounds from the roots of D. versipellis could inhibit the
growth of human carcinoma cells. In addition, PTO and DDPT could induce apoptosis of tumor cells.
Background
Cancer is the major cause of human deaths worldwide
because of its high incidence and mortality. Thousands
of people die of cancer each year despite aggressive
treatment regimens that include surgery, chemotherapy
and radiotherapy. Due to the infiltrative nature and the
rapid recurrence of the malignant tumor, complete sur-
gical resection of these tumors is typically not achieved
[1,2], and the conventional radiation and chemotherapy
are often intolerable due to the strong systemic toxicity
and local irritation [3-5]. These factors highlight the
urgent need for new therapies or therapeutic combina-
tions to improve the survival and quality of life of can-
cer patients.
In recent years, interest in phytochemicals from tradi-
tional Chinese medicinal herbs has been growing rapidly
due to their ability to inhibit the growth and prolifera-
tion of cancer cells [6-9]. Due to their nontoxic nature,
they are often employed in medical applications. Among
of them, flavonoids and lignans present in traditional
Chinese medicines have been revealed having significant
activities against some forms of cancer [1,10]. The
lignan podophyllotoxin is a plant toxin that exerts its
cytotoxicity effect by inhibiting microtubule assembly
and promoting cells to die via apoptosis [11]. However,
it is not used as a clinical therapeutic agent due to its
serious side effects. Extensive structure modifications
were performed to obtain more potent and less toxic
antitumor agents, e.g. etoposide [12] and teniposide [13]
are currently used in anticancer therapy. Besides, some
researchers found that podophyllotoxin and its deriva-
tives had inhibitory effect on PC3 and other cells
[14-16]. One of the popular Chinese herbal medicines,

source of podophyllotoxin [16] is a perennial herbaceous
species grown in the understory of mixed evergreen and
deciduous forests of China. In some folk remedies, D.
versipellis (Hance) M. Cheng has been widely used to
clear sputum, kill parasites and treat epidemic encepha-
litis B and epidemic parotitis. Previous studies have indi-
cated that constituents and extracts of this traditional
Chinese medicinal plant have growth inhibitory activities
against various tumors in vivo or in vitro [16-18]. How-
ever, systematic and comprehensive studies have not
been performed with regard to the chemical constitu-
ents from D. Versipellis and apoptosis-inducing effect of
these components.
Dysosma versipellis, an endangered and endemic
Bereridaceae plant species of China, has been proved to
be an important Chinese herbal medicine because of its
biological activity. In this study, fifteen compounds were
isolated from the rhizomes of D. versipellis which was
grown in Guizhou and identified by spectroscopic analy-
sis and physicochemical data as b-sitosterol (1), 4’-
demethylpodophyllotoxin (2), kaempferol (3), picropo-
dophyllotoxin-4-O-glucoside (4), cleistanthin-B (5),
kaempferol-3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (6), 4’-demethyl-
podophyllotoxin-4-O-glucoside (7), quercetin3-O-b-D -
glucopyranoside (8), icropodophyllotoxin-4-O-b-D-glu-
copyranosyl-(1®6)-b-D-glucopyranoside (9), quercetin
(10), daucosterol (11), podophyllotoxone (PTO, 12),
vanillic acid (13), 4’-demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin
(DDPT, 14), and sucrose (15). Among them, (5), (7),
(8), (12), (13)a n d( 15) were obtained from the plants
for the first time. All the compounds were then bioas-
sayed on human prostatic carcinoma cell line PC3,
human breast cancer cell line Bcap-37, human gastric
carcinoma cell line BGC-823 and mouse embryonic
fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 in vitro by MTT method. It
was found that DDPT had the most potent inhibitory
activities against the growth of human carcinoma cell
lines than other compounds extracted from D. versipel-
lis. And PTO obtained from the plants for the first time
also had high antitumor activity. There are a few reports
on the anticancer effects of PTO and DDPT on various
t u m o rc e l l sr e c e n t l y[ 1 9 - 2 1 ] .A n di tw a sf o u n dt h a tt h e
inhibitory rate of PTO (100 μg/mL) on P388 murine
leukemia cell proliferation was 99.0%. Also PTO could
induce HL-60 human leukemia cells apoptosis, which
might be related with down-regulation of Bcl-2 expres-
sion. Other studies have found that DDPT possessed
antitumor activity on A549 human lung carcinoma cell
and SK-MEL-2 human melanoma cell with EC50 of
0.023 μg/mL and 0.015 μg/mL respectively. However, no
report was found on the anticancer activities of PTO
and DDPT on PC3, Bcap-37 and BGC-823 cells. This
prompted us to study the anticancer activities of PTO
and DDPT separated from the rhizomes of D. versipel-
lis grown in Guizhou on the three kinds of cells men-
tioned above and investigate their preliminarily
mechanism of action as potent anticancer agents.
Thus, further investigations of PTO and DDPT on the
three cells lines were carried out on PC3, Bcap-37, and
BGC-823 cells. The IC50 of PTO and DDPT on the
three cell lines were determined. Furthermore, experi-
mental results of fluorescent staining and flow cytome-
try analysis indicated that PTO and DDPT could
induce apoptosis in PC3 and Bcap-37 cells, with the
apoptosis ratios of PC3 cells were 12.0% and 14.1%
after 72 h of treatment at 20 μM, respectively. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report on apop-
tosis inducing and antitumor activity of PTO and
DDPT on PC3, Bcap-37, and BGC-823 cells.

Plant material
The rootstalk of D. versipellis was collected in Qingz-
hen, Guizhou Province, China, in the month of May
2008. The voucher specimen was identified as D. versi-
pellis (hance.) M.Cheng by Qing-De Long, the Dean of
teaching-research section, School of Pharmacy of
Guiyang Medical University, and was submitted to our
laboratory for further investigation.
Extraction and isolation
The dried roots of D. versipellis (20 kg) from Guizhou
Province were powdered and extracted by maceration in
80% industrial alcohol (50 L, each 4d) for three times.
The extracts which filtered and washed with alcohol
each time were combined and reduced in vacuo to
afford 4 kg crude extract. A part of crude extract (950
g) was further extracted with petroleum ether, chloro-
form and ethyl acetate to obtain three fractions of 40 g,
2 kg and 280 g respectively.

mg) and 3 (200 mg) was obtained by PTLC and eluting
with CHCl3-MeOH (6:1 and 5:1) from fractions 1 and 2,
respectively. The fraction 3 was evaluated by Sephadex
LH-20 and eluted with acetone to afford compounds 4
(15 mg) and 5 (10 mg). And fraction 4 was eluted with
PE-EtOAc (10:1) and recrystallized with acetone to give
compound 12 (20 mg). The filtrate from fraction 5 was
eluted with PE-EtOAc (9:1 and 10:1, respectively) to
afford compounds 13 (25 mg) and 14 (23 mg).
The ethyl acetate extract (55 g) was chromatographed
on silica gel column (100-200 mesh) and eluted with
CHCl3-MeOH (15:1~0:1) to obtain fractions 1-3. The
fraction 1 was evaluated by Sephadex LH-20 (methanol)
to give compound 10 (50 mg). Compounds 6 (140 mg)
and 7 (209 mg) were obtained by silica gel column chro-
matography (200-300 mesh) and eluting with CHCl3-
MeOH (8:1) from fraction 2. The fraction 3 was further
chromatographed on silica gel column (100-200 mesh)
and eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (10:1~0:1) to give sub-
fractions 1-3. Compound 8 (30 mg) were obtained by
Sephadex LH-20 (methanol) from subfraction 1. The
subfraction 2 was recrystallized with CHCl3-MeOH (8:1)
to afford compound 15 (15 mg). The subfraction 3 was
recrystallized with MeOH and CHCl3-MeOH (9:1) to
give compound 9 (19 mg) and compound 11 (18 mg),
respectively.
Anticancer activity bioassay
Cell culture
Human prostate cancer cell line PC3, breast cancer cell
line Bcap-37, and gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 were
purchased from Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biol-
ogy, China Academy of Science and cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mouse embryonic fibroblast
cell line NIH 3T3 was also obtained from the same
place and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a humidi-
fied 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air incubator.
MTT asssy
All tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO (1-100
μM solution) and subsequently diluted in the culture
medium before treatment of the cultured cells. Tested
cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density 2×10
3
cells/well/100 μL of the proper culture medium and
treated with the compounds at 1 to 100 μM for 72 h. In
parallel, the cells treated with 0.1% DMSO served as
control. An MTT assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
1465-007) was performed 30 h later according to the
instructions provided by Roche. This assay was based on
the cellular cleavage of MTT into formazane which is
soluble in cell culture medium. Any absorbance caused
by formazan was measured at 595 nm with a microplate
reader (BIO-RAD, model 680), which is directly propor-
tional to the number of living cells in culture. The
experiment was performed in triplicate. The percentage
cytotoxicity was calculated using the formula.

AO/EB staining
Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5×10
4 cell/ml in
a volume of 0.6 mL on sterile cover slip in 6-well tissue
culture plates. Following incubation, the medium was
removed and replaced with fresh medium plus 10% FBS
and supplemented with podophyllotoxone and 4’-
demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin (20 μM). After the treat-
ment period, the cover slip with monolayer cells was
inverted on the glass slide with 20 μLo fA O / E Bs t a i n
(100 μg/mL). The fluorescence was read on an IX71SIF-
3 fluorescence microscope (OLYPUS Co., Japan).
Hoechst 33258 staining
Cells grown on sterile cover slip in 6-well tissue culture
plates were treated with podophyllotoxone and 4’-
demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin (20 μM) for a certain
range of treatment time. The culture medium contain-
ing compounds was removed and the cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing twice
with PBS, cells were stained with 0.5 mL of Hoechst
33258 staining (Beyotime) for 5 min. After washing
twice with PBS, stained nuclei were observed under an
IX71SIF-3 fluorescence microscope by using 350 nm
excitation and 460 nm emission.
TUNEL assays
TdT-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were per-
formed with colorimetric TUNEL apoptosis assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime).
Cells grown in 6 well culture clusters were treated as
mentioned in mitochondrial depolarization assay. In
short, Bcap-37 cells grown in 6-well tissue culture plates
were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 40 min. After washing once with PBS, cells
were permeabilized with immunol staining wash buffer
(Beyotime) for 2 min on ice. Cells were washed once
with PBS again and incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in metha-
nol at room temperature for 20 min to inactivate the
endogenous peroxidases after which the cells were
washed for three times with PBS. Thereafter, the cells
were incubated with 2 μL of TdT-enzymea and 48 μLo f

termination for 10 min, cells were incubated with strep-
tavidin-HRP (50 μL per specimen) conjugate diluted at
1:50 in diluent of streptavidin-HRP for 30 min. After
washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with
diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (200 μL per specimen)
for 10 min. This was again followed by washing with
PBS for two times and the result was imaged under an
XDS-1B inverted biological microscope (Chongqing
photoelectric device CO.).
Flow cytometry analysis
Prepared PC3 cells (1×10
6/mL) were washed twice with
cold PBS and then re-suspended gently in 500 μLb i n d -
ing buffer. Thereafter, cells were stained in 5 μL
Annexin V-FITC and shaked well. Finally, 5 μLP Iw a s
added to these cells and incubated for 20 min in a dark
place, analyzed by FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 10.0.
Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Mean separations were performed using the
least significant difference method (LSD test). Each
experiment had three replicates and all experiments
were run three times with similar results. Measurements
from all the replicates were combined and treatment
effects analyzed.

Anticancer activity
The potential effect of the extracts from D. versipellis
was investigated on the viability of PC3, Bcap-37, BGC-
823 and NIH3T3 cells using MTT assay at the concen-
tration of 20 μM, with ADM (adriamycin) [39] being
used as the positive control [40,41]. MTT [3-(4, 5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
assay is a common method of measuring the prolifera-
tion of cells. The results are summarized in Table 1. It
could be seen that PTO and DDPT possess potent activ-
ities against the three human cancer cell lines tested.

Further experiments found that proliferation of these
three carcinoma cells were significantly inhibited by

DDPT, the IC50 values were (10.6±1.5) μM, (13.2±0.5)
μM, (11.5±0.6) μM, respectively, which were both lower
than that on NIH 3T3 cells [(24.2±2.1) μMf o rP T O ;
(16.2±9.9) μM for DDPT]. The results showed that PTO
and DDPT had more potent activities against PC3,
Bcap-37 and BGC-823 cells than on NIH3T3 cells.
Besides, the inhibitory effect on tumor cells of DDPT
was stronger than that of PTO.
To determine whether the growth inhibitory activity of
PTO and DDPT were related to the induction of apop-
tosis, the morphological character changes of PC3 and
Bcap-37 cells were investigated using the AO/EB
staining and Hoechst 33258 staining under ﬂuorescence
microscopy.
Since acridine orange (AO) was a vital dye that could
stain nuclear DNA across an intact cell membrane and
ethidium bromide (EB) could only stain cells that had
lost membrane integrity. Thus, live cells will be uniformly
stained green, early apoptotic cells will be densely stained
as green yellow or displayed green yellow fragments,
while late apoptotic cells will be densely stained as orange
or displayed orange fragments, and necrotic cells will be

be found by the AO/EB doubly staining. After tumor
cells were treated with PTO and DDPT (20 μM) for 24,
48 h, the morphological changes were analyzed. As
shown in Figure 4, green live PC3 and Bcap-37 cells with
normal morphology were seen in the negative control
g r o u p( F i g u r e4 Aa n d4 A ’). In contrast, early apoptotic
cells with yellow green dots in PC3 cell nuclei and late
apoptotic cells with orange dots in Bcap-37 cell nuclei
could be seen in the positive control group (Figure 4D
and 4D’), meanwhile bright green early apoptotic cells
with nuclear margination and chromatin condensation
occurred in the experimental group with 24 h of treat-

Page 8 of 12cells with apoptotic bodies and chromatin fragmentation
could be seen when PTO and DDPT were applied for 48
h (Figure 4E and 4F). Similarly, morphological changes of
Bcap-37 cell apoptosis were also observed under micro-
scope (Figure 4B’,4 C ’,4 E ’,a n d4 F ’). The results sug-
gested that PTO and DDPT were able to induce
apoptosis in PC3 and Bcap-37 cells.
Hoechst 33258 staining was also carried out to investi-
gate the apoptosis induction of PTO and DDPT (20
μM) on PC3 and Bcap-37 cells. Membrane-permeable
Hoechst 33258 was a blue fluorescent dye and stained
the cell nucleus. When cells were treated with Hoechst
33258, live cells with uniformly light blue nuclei were
observed under fluorescence microscope, while apopto-
tic cells exhibited bright blue because of karyopyknosis
and chromatin condensation, and the nuclei of dead
cells could not be stained. The experimental results
were shown in Figure 5. Compared with the negative
control (Figure 5A and 5A’), a part of cells with smaller
nuclei and condensed staining appeared in the positive
control group (Figure 5D and 5D’). After treated with
PTO and DDPT for a given time, some PC3 cell nuclei
became pyknotic (shrunken and dark), as shown in
Figure 5B, 5C, 5E and 5F. Besides, Bcap-37 cells treated
with PTO and DDPT for 24 h had no obvious morpho-
logic changes (Figure 5B’ and 5E’), but most cell nuclei
appeared to be highly condensed (brightly stained) after
48 h of treatment (Figure 5C’ and F’). The results once
again indicated that PTO and DDPT could induce apop-
tosis in PC3 and Bcap-37 cells.
TUNEL assay was further carried out to confirm the
cell apoptosis inducing activities of PTO and DDPT.
TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase
Biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling) is a popular method
for identifying apoptotic cells in situ by detecting
DNA fragmentation. Due to degradation of DNA that
resulted from the activation of Ca/Mg dependent
endonucleases in apoptotic cells, DNA cleavage
occurred and led to breaking of strand within the
DNA. These strand breaks of cleaved DNA could be
identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT) that catalyzed the addition of biotin-dUTP.
The biotin-labeled cleavage sites were then detected
by reaction with streptavidin-HRP and visualized by
DAB indicating a brown color. As shown in Figure 6,
most nuclei were stained as a discernible brown in
the treatment groups with HCPT (Figure 6C and
6C’), PTO (Figure 6B and 6B’), and DDPT (Figure 6D
and 6D’) compared with the control (Figure 6A
and 6A’).
In addition, the apoptosis ratios induced by PTO
and DDPT caused apoptosis in tumor cells was quan-
titatively assessed by flow cytometry. In the early
stages of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine (PS) was trans-
located from the inside of the cell membrane to the
outside. Annexin V, a calcium dependent phospholi-
pid-binding protein associated with a high affinity for
phosphatidylserine, was used to detect early apoptotic
cells. PI (Propidine Iodide) was a red fluorescent dye
and stained cells that had lost membrane integrity. So,
cells stained with FITC-annexin V and PI were
discriminated necrotic cells (Q1, Annexin
-/PI
+), late
apoptotic cells (Q2, Annexin
+/PI
+), intact cells (Q3,
Annexin
-/PI
-) and early apoptotic cells (Q4, Annexin
+/PI
-) .A ss h o w ni nF i g u r e7 ,P T Oa n dD D P T( 2 0μM)
could induce apoptosis of PC3 cells, and highest apoptosis
ratios, 12.0% and 14.1% for PTO and DDPT respectively,
were obtained after 72 h of treatment at a concentration
of 20 μM. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 8, the early
(Q4) and late (Q2) apoptosis of PC3 cells which treated
with PTO and DDPT increased gradually in a time-depen-
dent manner. The late apoptotic ratio of cells increased to
approximately 11.0% at 72 h after treatment of PTO (20
μM), which was close to that of positive control HCPT
(11.8%). And the highest rate of early apoptosis was 7.0%
when cells were treated with DDPT at the concentration
of 20 μMf o r7 2h .

induced apoptosis in tumor cells detected by Hoechst 33258
staining. Tumor cells treated with PTO and DDPT (20 μM) were
stained by Hoechst 33258 and observed under ﬂuorescence
microscopy. For PC3 cells group, A: negative control (without
treatment); D: positive control, treated with HCPT (20 μM) for 24 h;
B and C: treated with PTO (20 μM) for 24, 48 h; E and F: treated
with DDPT (20 μM) for 24, 48 h, respectively. For Bcap-37 cells
group, A’: negative control (without treatment); D’: positive control,
treated with HCPT (20 μM) for 24 h; B’ and C’: treated with PTO (20
μM) for 24, 48 h; E’ and F’: treated with DDPT (20 μM) for 24, 48 h,
respectively.

effects observed in response to PTO and DDPT were
associated with induction of apoptotic cell death.
Conclusions
Dysosma versipellis (Hance) M. Cheng, an important
medicinal plant species, is considered ‘endangered’ by
the China Species Red List and has been considered as
vulnerable by the IUCN due to its rapid decline [42,43].
Therefore, studies on the chemical constituents from D.
versipellis and their biological activities have assumed
significance for the rational development and utilization
of this plant. In our study, fifteen compounds were
extracted and identified from D. versipellis grown in
Guizhou province, and the cell growth inhibition effects
of these constituents on PC3, Bcap-37, and BGC-823
cells were carried out by MTT assay. Among these com-
p o u n d s ,P T O ,w h i c hw a se x t r a c t e df r o mD. versipellis
for the first time, together with DDPT showed potent
activities on PC3, Bcap-37, and BGC-823 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. And the IC50 values of PTO
and DDPT on three cell lines were (17.8±1.0) μM, (21.1
±1.8) μM, (19 ±1.6) μM and (10.6±1.5) μM, (13.2±0.5)
μM, (11.5±0.6) μM, respectively.
The apoptosis inducing activities of PTO and DDPT
on PC3 and Bcap-37 cells were investigated through
AO/EB staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL and
ﬂow cytometry analysis assay. The results demonstrated
that PTO and DDPT from D. versipellis have potential
to be employed in adjuvant therapy for treating human
prostate and breast tumors. Further studies of the
