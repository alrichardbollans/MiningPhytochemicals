A method for the simultaneous determination of free chlorogenic acids (CGA) and sesquiterpene lactones (STL) in chicory root
and its dried (flour) and roasted (grain) forms is described. The method uses one extraction and one analysis for all chicory root
products. Various solvents with low to high polarity, such as methanol, chloroform, or n-hexane, were tested alone, in combination
in different proportions or with acidified or neutral aqueous solvent. The water/chloroform/methanol (30/30/40, v/v/v) mixture
generated the best extraction yield, 21%higher than alcoholmixtures.Theprofiling ofCGAand STL contentwas performed through
a conventional HPLC-DADmethod using a PFP core shell column in a fast single run. Good retention time and area repeatability
(RDD mean % 0.46 and 5.6, resp.) and linearity (𝑅2 ≥ 0.96) were obtained. The STL and chlorogenic acids levels determined
were 254.7 and 100.2 𝜇g/g of dry matter in the root, 792.5 and 1,547 𝜇g/g in flour, and 160.4 and 822.5 𝜇g/g in the roasted grains,
respectively. With an average recovery of 106% and precision of 90%, this method is rapid, reproducible, and straightforward way
to quantify the chlorogenic acids and STL in chicory raw material and end products.
1. Introduction
Sesquiterpene lactones (STL) and chlorogenic acids (CGA)
are soluble secondary main metabolites that accumulate in
Asteraceae, especially in chicory [1]. The diversity of the
chemical structure of these compounds allows these mol-
ecules to be involved in various physiological processes used
by plants, such as the attraction of pollinators [2], the re-
pulsion of herbivores [3], and protection against pathogens
[4].
Many cultivated types of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)
exist, such as those used in salads, forage, and, in particular,
industrial chicory utilized for the production of roots as raw
material. Industrial chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum)
has economic importance in many agricultural regions in
the world as a source of inulin or food [5]. In northern
France, chicory root is grown especially for use as dried or
roasted products and beverage. Once harvested, the root is
sliced and dried to produce an intermediate raw material
called green slices.The slices are either ground to obtain flour
or roasted and then crushed into grains. The grains can be
marketed directly or extracted with hot water to obtain a
concentrated liquid or, after spray-drying, soluble powders.
Chicory flour can be used as bread-improving ingredient, and
when roasted, chicory is used to enhance the aroma, color,
or flavor of food. Thus, chicory root is consumed in different
forms of derivative products in the human diet.

In addition to their known roles in plants, secondary
metabolites present in chicory root may add value to food
products via their biological properties. STL and CGA are
known for their anti-inflammatory [6], analgesic [7], and
neuroprotective actions [8]. 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, a
chlorogenic acid, is responsible for nearly 70% of the antiox-
idant activity of chicory [9]. In addition to their potential
beneficial effects on human health, these secondary metabo-
lites play a role in the organoleptic properties of chicory.
Indeed, chicory root is known for its bitter taste, which is
essentially due to STL, mainly lactucin (Lc) and lactucopicrin
(Lp) [10, 11].
Taken together, these nutritional and organoleptic prop-
erties are important factors for the appreciation and con-
sumption of chicory products.The contents of STL and CGA
represent a quality parameter of the raw material. Charac-
terizing these compounds is part of a broader framework
of varietal improvement and process optimization programs
designed to improve the end product quality. However,
these approaches are constrained by the requirement for the
often tedious extraction of several thousand samples, routine
analysis, and multiple assays to ensure the detection of these
molecular families in various matrices.
The composition and distribution of STL and CGA
have been extensively studied in leaf products of chicory
crops such as salads, chicon, and forage [12–14]. However,
despite studies of these compounds in fresh or roasted roots
[11, 15, 16], the contents of both free STL and CGA in
industrial chicory root and its derivative foods have not been
determined.
Extraction modalities differ from one group of molecules
to another and depend on the plant material from which
the molecules are extracted. From the leaf of Cichorium
intybus L. var. sylvestre, Mulinacci et al. [17] extracted CGA
using water and fractionation by many solvents (ethanol, n-
hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate). Price et al. [10] used
methanol and chloroform to extract STL from the leaf of
Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum and var. sylvestre. Van Beek
et al. [11] used ethyl acetate, methanol, chloroform, ethanol,
and acetone sequentially to extract STL from the root of
Cichorium intybus. More recently, the extraction of STL and
CGA from “Catalogna and Head Radicchio” chicory leaves
using a unique mixture of solvents was proposed [18] with
separate analyses for the STL and CGA by high-performance
liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector
(HPLC-DAD).
Until now, no method for determining the major sec-
ondary metabolites involved in the qualities of the chicory
root and processed products from this plant has been
described.Thepurpose of this studywas the development and
validation of a method for the simultaneous determination
of free STL and CGA from the root of Cichorium intybus
var. sativum and its food products, including extraction and
analysis. In our work, we tested different solvents and combi-
nations of solvents to extract these major secondary metabo-
lites from several matrices. We also developed a quantitative
analytic method on conventional HPLC-DAD and a polar
reverse-phase column Kinetex PFP for the rapid and self-
limiting separation of target compounds. Compounds were
authenticated by ultraperformance liquid chromatography
coupled with high resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-
HRMS).
2. Methods
2.1. Biological Materials. Three major transformation prod-
ucts of industrial chicory were analyzed. The root was ob-
tained from an agronomic trial, located in Coutiches, France,
conducted in 2011 by the company Florimond-Desprez
Veuve et Fils SAS (Capelle-en-Pe´ve`le, France). Flour and
roasted grains were obtained from the company Leroux SAS
(Orchies, France).
The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80∘C. For the experiments, the samples were
freeze-dried (48 h) and ground (ball mill, Retsch, Eragny sur
Oise, France) using 50mL wells and 25mm balls to obtain a
fine powder. These samples were stored at −80∘C.
2.2. Analytical Reagents and Chemicals. The solvents (meth-
anol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), chloroform (CHCl
3
), dichlo-
romethane (CH
2
Cl
2
), acetonitrile (ACN), acetone (Ac), ethyl
acetate (EtOAc), and n-hexane (n-hex)), acetic acid (AAC),
formic acid (FA), and ortho-phosphoric acid used for the
extraction and chemical analysis were all HPLC grade and
were obtained from the Dislab company (Lens, France). All
of these solvents and acids were stored at 4∘C. The standards
used for the HPLC analysis were 5-mono-O-caffeoylquinic
acid (5-CQA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA)
and were provided by Biopurify (Chengdu, China). 11(S),13-
Dihydrolactucin (DHLc), lactucin (Lc), 11(S),13-dihydrolac-
tucopicrin (DHLp), and lactucopicrin (Lp) were provided
by Extrasynthe`se (Genay, France); 11(S),13-dihydro-8-deoxy-
lactucin (DHdLc) and 8-deoxylactucin (dLc) were extracted,
purified in the laboratory from industrial chicory root, and
authenticated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
13C NMR [19] (Figure 1).
2.3. Extraction of CGA and STL. Several extraction methods
have been tested using different solvents and combinations
to extract CGA and STL simultaneously, including methanol
100% (MeOH); ethanol 100% (EtOH); acetone 100% (Ac);
ethyl acetate 100% (EtOAc); n-hexane 100% (n-hex); chloro-
form 100% (CHCl

), and water/ethanol
(H

O/EtOH); 75/24/1, 75/23/2, 75/22/3, and 75/21/4 mixtures
(v/v/v) of methanol/water/acetic acid (MeOH/H
2
O/AAC)
and methanol/water/formic acid (MeOH/H
2
O/FA); and 40/
40/20, 30/30/40, 25/25/50, and 20/20/60 mixtures (v/v/v) of
water/chloroform/methanol (H

/MeOH). These
extractions were carried out by maceration; 100mg pow-
der was extracted with 1.5mL of solvent (1/15 ratio, w/v).
For the extraction modalities with water/chloroform and
water/chloroform/methanol, the solvents were added one at a
time.The tubeswere agitated for 17 h (o/n) in the dark at room
temperature. The tubes were then centrifuged (12,000 r.p.m.
at 4∘C for 8min), and the supernatantswere filtered in 96-well

2.4. HPLC-DAD Quantification. A Prominence HPLC sys-
tem (Shimadzu, Marne la Valle´e, France) consisting of a
quaternary pump (LC-20AD) and a UV-visible diode array
detector (SPD-20A) was used to detect CGA and STL at
320 and 254 nm, respectively. A Kinetex PFP column (100 ×
4.6mm, 2.6 𝜇m) (Phenomenex, Le Pecq, France) was used
for compound separation. The separation method lasted 16.5
min.The elutionwas performed in gradientmode using three
different solvents—water (solvent A), MeOH (solvent B), and
ACN (solvent C)—all acidified with 0.1% ortho-phosphoric
acid. Solvent B gradient rose from an initial 7.5–17.5% at
1min, 32.5% at 5min, and 80% at 8min, returning to 7.5%
at 9min until the end of the run; solvent C was kept at 12%
throughout.Theoven temperaturewas 45∘C, and the flow rate
was 1.1mL/min. The amount of sample injected was 5 𝜇L.
The quantification was performed by external calibration
using standards (5-CQA, 3,5-diCQA, DHLc, Lc, DHdLc,
dLc DHLp, Lp.), each repeated five times. The respective
calibration curves were constructed by linear regression
plotting signal area versus compound concentration. The
analytic precision was measured within and between days.
Each extractwas analyzed three times consecutively and three
times on three different days.
2.5.UPLC-HighResolutionMSAnalysis/Authentication. Chro-
matographic separation was performed on an Accela UPLC
system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Kinetex PFP col-
umn (100 × 4.6mm, particle size 2.6𝜇m; Phenomenex). The
elution was performed with the same HPLC-DAD gradient
mode as described previously using water (solvent A),MeOH
(solvent B), and ACN (solvent C), all acidified with 0.1%
formic acid. The LC flow rate was 1mL/min; the injection
volumewas 5𝜇L.The columnoven temperaturewas 45∘Cand
the sample tray temperature 4∘C.
Eluted compounds were detected in negative mode in
full mass scan (m/z 120 to 900) using a Thermo Scientific
Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer Q Exactive equipped with a
heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II). Instrument
parameters were as follows: sheath gas 60, auxiliary gas 20
(both arbitrary units), spray voltage 4 kV, capillary tempera-
ture 275∘C, capillary voltage −60V, tube lens voltage −135V,
skimmer voltage −20V, and source temperature 300∘C.

Mass spectra were recorded at a resolution of 50,000 with
an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 500,000 and a
maximum injection time of 500ms.
2.6. Validation Method
2.6.1. Linearity, Limit of Detection (LOD), and Limit of Quan-
tification (LOQ). Linearity was studied for each molecule.
Using a series of seven dilutions, the standard concentrations
ranged from 3.3 to 70,000 ng/mL, and each was repeated five
times.
The LOD and LOQ were determined for each molecule.
All dilutions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD to determine the
average concentration (𝜇) corresponding to the loss of signal
detection and quantification (blank sample) for each of the
three products. The LOD was defined by 𝜇 + 3𝜎 and LOQ
by 𝜇 + 10𝜎, where 𝜎 represents the standard deviation of the
blank.
2.6.2. Precision and Specificity. Repeatability was evaluated
for each product by six successive repetitions of the extraction
method. Reproducibility was calculated for each product
by three successive repetitions performed on different days.
The coefficient of variation (% respective standard deviations
(RSD)) served as a measure of precision.
The specificity of the extraction method was evaluated by
varying the proportions of solvents H
2
O/CHCl
3
/MeOH plus
and minus 4% compared to the optimal method.
2.6.3. Extractability and Recovery Rate Matrix Effect. The
root, flour, and roasted grains were extracted using the
optimum conditions according to the extractionmethod (see
Section 2.3). Once all the supernatant was recovered, the
pellet was reextracted under the conditions described above.
Three repetitions were performed on each product. The
extraction efficiency was the rate of extractable compounds
(without reextraction) under the optimal modality and was
measured as the ratio between the contents obtained during
the first extraction (𝐸1) and all contents (first extraction
(𝐸1) + reextraction 17 h (𝐸2)). The extraction rate (ER) is
expressed as
ER = ( 𝐸1
(𝐸1 + 𝐸2)
) × 100. (1)
The recovery rate was calculated by adding 0.075, 0.15, or
0.3mM of 5-CQA; 0.0075, 0.03, or 0.075mM of 3,5-diCQA;
or 0.007, 0.014, or 0.045mMofDHLc to the flour.Three repli-
cates are performed by employing the optimum extraction
modality. The recovery rate (RR) is the ratio between the
measured content (MC) and the theoretical content (TC):
RR = (MC
TC
) × 100. (2)
The effect of the extraction mixture on possible conversions
of the chemical structures of the target compounds was
evaluated by observing the variation in their content by
HPLC-DAD analysis.Three representative target compounds
(5-CQA, 3,5-diCQA, and DHLc) were directly added indi-
vidually in three different concentrations to the solvent
mixture, in a chicory or “no-chicory matrix” (flour wheat).
The extraction procedure was completed as described. The
overlapping of chromatographic signals corresponding to the
addition of themolecules was evaluated. Nomatrix effect was
obtained when no interfering peak was present and when the
linearity of the response was observed.
2.7. Statistics and Calculation. All extractions and analyses
were performed in triplicate, except for linearity, which was
repeated five times. Data are expressed as the means of
individual repeats with the RSD of each extraction condition.
Statistical analysis was performed using R 2.15.1 forWindows
[20] and used to examine between-extract variation. When
the Bartlett test was significant for homogeneity of variance,
the extraction effect on metabolite levels was estimated by
a one-way ANOVA, and mean separations were evaluated
by pairwise comparison using Student’s 𝑡-test. Log𝑃 values
(predicted lipophilicity) were calculated from online chem-
informatics services provided by theMolinspiration Property
Calculation Service (2013) [21].
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Method Development. Several methods for extracting
STL or CGA from the leaves of Cichorium intybus L. var.
Catalogna and var. Rosso di Chioggia [18], var. sylvestre [17],
and Cichorium endivia var. crispa [22] have been described.
However, no method for the determination of STL and
CGA exists for industrial chicory root and its derivatives.
In our work, these compounds were determined in different
products of chicory from a single extraction and analysis.The
relative contents obtained from the extraction were evaluated
by HPLC-DAD.
The first screen was performed using pure solvents that
cover a wide range of polarity, including MeOH, EtOH,
Ac, EtOAc, n-hex, CHCl
3
, or CH
2
Cl
2
. Only the contents
obtained from a selection of solvents (maximum extraction
without excluding any metabolites) are shown in Table 1.
Thus, the extraction efficiency of MeOH compared to EtOH
orCHCl
3
was, on average, 4.5 times higher for all products. In
general, in terms of the quantity of STL and CGA extracted,
methanol is more effective (𝑃 value < 0.05) than the less
polar solvents such as chloroform [23] and ethanol [24].
The other tested solvents, including acetone, ethyl acetate, n-
hexane, and dichloromethane, delivered extraction yields up
to 7 times lower than MeOH. These data are confirmed by
the work of Ferioli and D’Antuono [18], which demonstrated
that the extraction of chicory salad with MeOH yields at
least twice the STL of extraction with EtOH, acetone, or
ethyl acetate. Although molecules are mainly extracted with
chloroform, ethanol, and methanol, the content increases
with solvent polarity. The solubility of STL and CGA, such
as Lc or 5-CQA, in the alcoholic solvents may be due to the
high surface polarity notably induced by hydroxyl, carbonyl,
and 𝛾-lactone moieties. However, the presence of methyl,
methylene, and phenyl groups provides a lipophilic character

6 The Scientific World Journal
to the compounds that can explain their extractability in less
polar solvents, such as chloroform. As observed with DHLp
and Lp, their greater solubility in chloroform and in nonaque-
ous solvents, such as hexane or dichloromethane (data not
shown), might be related to their higher lipophilicity shown
by the calculated log𝑃 values of 1.27 and 1.1, respectively
(Figure 1).
Extractability was increased by expanding the polarity
range with the addition of water (25, 50, or 75%) to three
selected solvents. The aqueous alcohol system H
2
O/MeOH
(25/75, v/v) was more effective in extracting compounds
with a low affinity for alcohol. Indeed, the addition of
water increased the extraction efficiency of MeOH by 1.4,
1.5, and 2.2 times for the root, roasted grains, and flour,
respectively (Table 1). The water simultaneously reduced the
dehydrating effect of MeOH and promoted its diffusion
in the matrix, allowing a better penetration of the solvent
mixture and an increased extraction of STL. These actions
help to solubilize all target compounds more extensively.
However, the effect was limited and resulted in a loss of
performance when the percentages of water reached 50 and
75%. Indeed, according to Elliott et al. [25], the swelling
of the membranes favors the penetration of alcohol and is
optimal when the proportion of water in the aqueous alcohol
mixture is 25%. These results are confirmed by Song et al.
[24], who found that a porous membrane is favored by a
high concentration of alcohol. Under the same conditions,
the water was tested in combination with CHCl
3
or EtOH. As
in the case of MeOH, the best extraction rates were achieved
with 25% water. Whereas a mixture of water and ethanol
did not improve the extraction efficiency of the H
2
O/MeOH
system (25/75, v/v), adding water to CHCl
3
increased the
extraction rate of the roasted product and root by 2- and 3-
fold, respectively. Chloroform, which is less polar than water,
carries more amphiphilic-like and fewer polar compounds.
According to Burianek andYousef [26], the interface between
these two solvents, which results from their immiscibility,
forms a suitable environment to concentrate these molecules.
Moreover, during maceration, agitation optimizes not only
the transfer of matrix molecules to water but also water to
this interface. Therefore, the molecules’ affinity for less polar
phases promotes their extraction in chloroform. To increase
the extraction polarity, optimization was conducted using an
H
2
O/MeOH combination (25/75, v/v), which we denote as
H
2
O/MeOH.
Organic acids are known to penetrate and destabilize
agentmembranes [27]. As such, acetic acid (AAC) and formic
acid (FA) were tested in addition to the methanol mixture to
maximize extraction.TheMeOH/H
2
O/AAC system (75/24/1,
v/v/v) conferred the same extraction yields for the root and
flour but up to 1.5 times lower than the H
2
O/MeOH system
for the roasted grains (Table 1). The final proportion of acid
in the mixture (2, 3, or 4%) or the use of formic acid
instead of acetic acid did not cause a significant difference
in the extraction yields of flour (𝑃 value = 0.06) and roasted
grains (𝑃 value = 0.14). Furthermore, the superposition
and similarity of the absorption spectra of target signals
indicated no difference between an acidified extraction and
a nonacidified extraction (data not shown).
The extraction method was optimized by combining
waterwith chloroformandmethanol in different proportions.
The presence of chloroform in the mixture increased the
extraction yield of the flour by 35% compared to H
2
O/MeOH
(Table 1). Chloroform, a solvent of intermediate polarity,
leads to the generation of twice as many amphiphilic-like
molecules as H
2
O/MeOH, similarly to dLc and 3,5-diCQA.
The presence of methanol in the water and the interface
between chloroform and the aqueous phase would extend
the polarity of the mixture, facilitating the extraction of
polar and less polar compounds.These compoundswere then
recovered together by removing the interface through the
addition of methanol, allowing their simultaneous analysis.
3.2. Authentication. Main secondary metabolites of the chic-
ory are authenticated in chicory products by UPLC-HRMS.
Table 2 shows authentication characteristics of STL and CGA
in flour. Theoretical exact mass (M) was calculated from
the formula at which one proton is subtracted (M-H+) for
negative mode analysis. Each molecular ion (M-H+) was
extracted from the MS-TIC (Total Ionic Courant).
Exact mass (Mc), elementary formula, ring double bond
(RDB), and precision (ppm) are calculated for each analyte.
All elementary formula propositions with precision more
than 7 ppm are rejected. For flour, the lowest ppm is 4.156 ±
0.260 for 3,5-diCQA and the highest is 6.658 ± 0.160 for
DHLp, with an average of 5.866. When exact mass with
exactly elementary formula and low ppm have the same RDB
theoretical, we can authenticate the molecule. Each exact
mass (Mc) is associatedwith a retention time (RT) and elution
order is the same as for the HPLC-DAD analysis.
All metabolites are authenticated in flour (Table 2) but
also in root and roasting grains (data not shown).
3.3. Validation
3.3.1. LOD, LOQ, and Linearity. In this study, the following
STL and CGA commonly found in chicory were studied:
DHLc, Lc, DHdLc, dLc, DHLp, Lp, 5-CQA, and 3,5-diCQA.
The quantification of target compounds was undertaken
by an HPLC-DAD analysis of standards. For the efficient
separation of all metabolites of interest while providing a
meaningful flow analysis, we used chromatographic columns
based on core-shell particles of 2.6 𝜇m [28]. A Kinetex PFP
column (Phenomenex) was chosen because of its ability
to separate positional isomers [29]. The samples analyzed
showed separation with a very good resolution of the target
compounds in 16.5min. This method allows for the analysis
of approximately 90 samples per day operating in a conven-
tional chromatographic system.
Table 3 shows the RT, the LOD and LOQ, the linearity
range, the coefficient of determination (𝑅2), and the equation
of the slope of the standard range for each metabolite tested.
The STL absorbed in UV range between 190 and 260 nm
(max. 254 nm) and the CGA between 210 and 320 nm (max.
320 nm). The RTs of each molecule for all wavelengths
were different, indicating the lack of coelution of molecules,
as evidenced by the resolution factor Rs value above 8.5

(i.e., DHLp and Lp), promoting better quantization. This
separation is even more effective using the Kinetex column,
whose chemistry (based on PFP groups, aromatic interaction
𝜋-𝜋, and H-F) allows for the resolution of positional isomers,
which include the targeted CGA and STL. The analytic
precision (repeatability and reproducibility) was measured
by the intra- and interday (three different days) repetition
method and is expressed in terms of the variation (RSD %)
of RT and areas obtained (Table 4). A small variation of RT
(here, a maximum of 0.9%) is very important to avoid the
misidentification of peaks in samples.The area variation was,
in general, small but higher for the reproducibility tests, with
means of 6.8% for CGA and 6.4% for STL, as summarized in
Table 4.
The LODs defined for all compounds were between
2 and 9.5 ng/mL (Table 3). The LOQs ranged from 3.3 to
89.5 ng/mL. Linearity ranges varied from 1 to 6,140 times the
LOQ (Table 3). Thus, the concentration range, for all com-
pounds, extended from 3.3 to 70,000 ng/mL. Linearity was
perfectly preserved for each range, as illustrated by 𝑅2 above
0.96. For each molecule, the H
2
O/CHCl
3
/MeOH system
(30/30/40, v/v/v) enables the extraction of a content greater
than the limit of quantification without surpassing the limit
of linearity. Under these extraction conditions, no additional
preparation, such as dilution or enrichment, is necessary for
these samples.
3.3.2. Precision and Specificity. The precision of the H

O/
CHCl
3
/MeOH (30/30/40, v/v/v) extractionmethodwas eval-
uated by six successive intraday repetitions and three succes-
sive interday repetitions. This variable is expressed in terms
of variation (RSD %) by the repeatability and reproducibility
of the obtained contents of each targetmetabolite (Table 4). A
maximum of 10 and 12% variation was observed for repeata-
bility and reproducibility, respectively. These results indicate
good accuracy of the extraction for all target metabolites.

/
MeOH (30/30/40, v/v/v) was evaluated for each metabolite
in the three products (Table 4). Residual contents measured
from the reextraction of the pellet were used to define
the extractability rate of the first method. The minimum
extractability was observed for 3,5-diCQA in root (76%), and
the maximum extractability was observed for the 5-CQA
in the root (94%). For all metabolites, only one extraction
of 17 h yielded 84% total efficiency for the roots and flour
and 88% for the roasted grains. Extractability is favorable
for STL present in roasted matrix, as shown by a yield close
to 89%. However, the measured levels indicate a low initial
concentration of STL in the roasted grains.
5-CQA, 3,5-diCQA, and DHLc were added to the flour
at different concentrations to determine the recovery rate of

The flour was used because of its richness in STL and CGA.
The concentrations tested were 0.075, 0.15, and 0.3mM 5-
CQA; 0.0075, 0.03, and 0.075mM 3,5-diCQA; and 0.007,
0.014, and 0.045mM DHLc. Recovery rates were between 94
and 122% (Table 5), with an average rate of 106%, indicating
the effectiveness of the method.

The addition of different concentrations of 5-CQA, 3,5-

on the conversion of the chemical structure of the target
compounds. The choice of “no-chicory” material focused on
wheat flour because the targeted metabolites are absent. In
the chicory matrix, the variation in the levels of metabolites,
with or without addition, was between 2 and 9% and was
included within the repeatability values. In the “no-chicory”
matrix, no conversion was observed for the other molecules
(contents), and the solvent alone did not change the structure
of the compounds (data not shown).
3.4. STL and CGA in Products Derived from Chicory. The
flour and the roasted product were derived from the same
batch of roots and were analyzed with the evaluated deter-
mination method (Figure 2). For the first time, the CGA
and STL composition was demonstrated in chicory flour and
the presence of STL in the roasted grains was identified.
The sesquiterpene lactones and chlorogenic acids levels
were 254.7 and 100.2 𝜇g/g of dry matter in the root, 792.5
and 1,547 𝜇g/g in flour, and 160.4 and 822.5𝜇g/g in the
roasted grains, respectively (Table 1). The ratio of secondary
metabolites between the root and the flour was 5.7 (𝑃 value
= 0.0014), between the root and the roasted grains 2.2 (𝑃
value = 0.0002), and between the flour and the roasted grains
2.6 (𝑃 value = 0.0021). The drying of roots increases the
levels of metabolites, most likely due to the release of the
bound forms, while roasting tends to degrade all molecules.
Supplementary work is being conducted on the presence of
the conjugated and free forms of the metabolites of interest.
The study of the process effects on the content of secondary
metabolites related to the organoleptic characteristics of the
various products is also in progress.
4. Conclusion
Our work has shown that the ternary mixture H
2
O/CHCl
3
/
MeOH (30/30/40, v/v/v) can be used to extract the content
of chlorogenic acids and sesquiterpene lactones of chicory
root and its main food derivatives, flour, and roasted grains,
simultaneously, with a higher efficiency than aqueous alcohol
systems and a strong representation of the molecules. Direct
extraction of the material, without an intermediate fraction-
ation step (liquid-liquid extraction, SPE), evaporation, or
resolubilization, followed by a short and simple chromato-
graphic analysis, is a flexible, fast, and effective method. The
chromatographic method profiled eight molecules belonging
to families of major soluble secondary metabolites of chicory
plant and is conducted with one extraction and one analy-
sis. This method of simultaneous determination allows for
comparative studies (physiological, genetic, or influencing
the process) among the many products derived from chicory.
This targeted approach is currently being evaluated with
a more comprehensive approach in which different mix-
tures tested to achieve this optimal system, including water/
chloroform/methanol solutions at 20/20/60 or 30/30/40 (v/
v/v), are combined with methodologies developed for the
analysis of plant metabolomics [30]. These studies suggest
10 The Scientific World Journal
the possibility of extending the metabolomics approach we
have developed for chicory.
