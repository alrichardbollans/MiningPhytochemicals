The complete structure of these sesquiterpene compounds have been determined as 5/3,11,12-trihydroxy-iphionan-4-one and 2-[5' -(2'-oxopentyl)]-2-methyl-5-(1' -hydroxy-1' -methylethanol)-cyclohexanone, respectively. INTRODUCTION Jasonia glutinosa D. C. (Chiliadenus saxatilis, Cass.) [1] Chiliadenus glutinosus (L.) Fourr. [2], Asteraceae is an annual medicinal plant occurring in the Mediterranean littoral area of the Iberian Peninsula [3], South ofFrance and Malta [ 4]. lt is used in traditional medicine as an antispasmodic drug [3]. Until now, only sesquiterpene alcohols have been investigated [5-7]. In the present paper we report the isolation and structural elucidation of two new sesquiterpenoids. RESUL T AND DISCUSSION The FAB MS spectrum of lucinone (1) showed the molecular ion at m/z 271 [M - H + J + in agreement with a molecular formula of C15H26Ü4 . The 400 MHz 1 H NMR spectrum shows two singlets at D0.96 and 1.09 ppm which were attributed to two quaternary methyl groups. A third singlet signa! (3H) located at 2.20 ppm was assigned to a carbonyl methyl group. Close inspection of the remaining 1 H NMR resonances con­firmed the presence of methylene protons linked to an oxygen-bearing carbon (an AB quartet (J = 11 Hz) at 3.46 and 3.43 ppm) and a deshielded signal at b3.41 ppm (lH, dd, J = 7.9, 10.2 Hz). In the 13C NMR spectrum theoccurrence of a carbonyl function was supported by the resonance at 213.8 ppm. The multiplicities of the indi­vidual 13C peaks determined using the DEPT pulse se-'l]Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. quence, indicated four quaternary carbons, three methyl groups and six methylene and two methine resonances. lt can be concluded from these data that compound 1 must contain two rings. The structural determination of lucinone (1) can be easily accomplished using a combination of homonuclear and both direct and long-range heteronuclear chemical shift correlation experiments. One-bond proton-carbon chemical shift correlation was established using the proton detected. C, H correla­tion technique HMQC [8] and providing the identities of the direct responses. Utilizing the long-range heteronu­clear multiple quantum bond connectivity (HMBC) dia­gram [9], structural fragments can be determined. Thus, the following substructures Al, B1 and Cl were deduced from the connectivities observed between the proton methyl shifts and carbons rJ. and /3 to these groups. Finally, analysis of long-range heteronuclear correla­tion responses for the other 1 H resonances in conjunc­tion with the proton intercoupling network determined from the homonuclear 1 H-1 H correlation COSY [10, 11] permits the inclusion of other groups in structuralfragments Al, B1 and Cl. From this information (Table1), the structure of lucinone (1) was deduced to be5¡1,11, 12-trihydroxy-iphionan-4-one. Since these13C NMR data were consistent with those concerningsimilar iphionan-type sesquiterpenoids [12], we sup­posed the same stereochemistry at C-3, C-5, C-7 andC-10 positions for l.The molecular formula for 2 was found to beC 15H2604 , by FAB MS (m/z 271) [M - H+ ] + . lts A1 14 Lucinone (1) 14 Glutinone (2) B1 C1 1 H NMR spectrum indicates three methyl resonating as sing)ets (151.11, 1.12, and 2.11 ppm) and two protons on an oxygen-bearing carbon (AB· quartet, J = 10.8 Hz, 153.56 and 3.41 ppm). Moreover, the methyl sing)et at 2.11 ppm can be ascribed with certainty to a methyl carbonyl group. The 1 3C NMR data revealed the pres­ence of two carbonyl signals (15215.89 and 209.27 ppm). The multiplicities of the 13CNMR peaks (4C, 3CH3 , 7CH2 and 1CH) and the above results suggested a mono­cyclic structure for l. The molecular framework and the complete 1 H and 13C chemical shift assignments (Table 1) of glutinone (2) were deduced, as for lucinone (1) on the basis of the concerted application of two-dimensional experiments. Considerations of the various connectivities (Fig. 1) in conjunction with the inferences drawn from the conven­tional 1D NMR spectra gave 2-(5'-(2' -oxopentyl))-2-methyl-5-(1' -hydroxy-1' -methylethanol)-cyclohexanone as identification of compound l.

EXPERIMENTAL Jasonia glutinosa plants were collected in July 1993 in San Andres del Congosto (Guadalajara, Spain) and a voucher specimen is kept in the Department of Vegetal Biology (Faculty of Sciences, University of Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain). Extraction and isolation. The dried aerial parts (1 kg) was extracted with MeOH (10 mi g- 1; 48 hr) at room temp. The MeOH extract (144 g) was subjected to solvent partitioning between n-hexane and 5% aq. MeOH. The aq. MeOH portion was further extracted with CH2Cl2 , 25 g of the CH2Cl2 fraction was subjected to CC over silica (Kieselgel G-60, 0.040--0.063 mm; Merck. The frac­tion obtained after elution with CH2Cl2-MeOH (97:3) was further submitted to MPLC (RP-18; 0.026-0.040 mm; Merck; MeOH (50--100%)). Elution with MeOH 60% yielded compounds 1 (59.5 mg) and 2 (95 mg). The possibility of aldol condensation was unlikely since ali procedures were conducted in neutral conditions. Analytical TLC. This was performed on precoated Si gel plates (Kieselgel G-60 F-254, 0.25 mm, Merck) using the following solvent system EtOAC 100% and reverse phase plates (RP-18 F254S, Merck) using MeOH 75% as solvent. Visualization of the TLC plates was achieved with a long wavelength UV lamp and H2SO4 spray reagent.
