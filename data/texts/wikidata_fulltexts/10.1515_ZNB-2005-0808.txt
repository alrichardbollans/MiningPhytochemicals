Naturforsch. 60b, 867 – 869 (2005); received December 28, 2004Two new spiranoid withanolides, (20R,22R,23R)-12β ,17β ,22-trihydroxy-1-oxo-12,23-cycloergo-sta-2,24-dien-26,23-olide (3) and (23R)-5α ,6β ,12β ,21-tetrahydroxy-1,22-dioxo-12,23-cycloergo-sta-2,17,24-trien-26,23-olide (4) were isolated from plants of Jaborosa odonelliana and Jaborosaruncinata, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 were characterized by a combination of spectroscopicmethods (1D and 2D NMR, MS) and molecular modelling.Key words: Jaborosa, Withanolides, JaborosalactoneIntroductionThe withanolides are a group of natural C28-steroidal lactones built on an intact or arranged er-gostane framework that occurs mainly in plants of cer-tain genera of Solanaceae. The first member of thisgroup of compounds, withafarin A, was isolated fromthe well-known Indian medicinal plant, Withania som-nifera [1] and its structure was fully elcidated by Lavieand coworkers in 1965 [2]. The withanolides exhibit avariety of biological activities as antifeedant, immuno-suppressive and cancer chemoprevention activity [3].Jaborosa Miers is a South American genus belong-ing to the Solanaceae family that comprises about 23species, 11 of which are almost exclusively distributedin Argentina [4]. Previous studies on populations ofJ. odonelliana, J. runcinata and J. araucana, gave agroup of withanolides with a spiranoid lactone ring inthe side chain. The compounds isolated from J. odonel-liana presented a 17,22-diol functionality and a 23Sstereochemistry at the spiranoid center (e.g. Jaboros-alactone P, 1) [5], while those isolated from J. run-cinata and J. araucana showed a 17(20)-ene-22-ketosystem and a 23R stereochemistry (e.g. Jaborosalac-tone 2, 2) [6], in agreement with that found in 1.Studies on cancer chemopreventive activity of with-anolides as inducers of phase II detoxification enzymesindicated that the spiranoid withanolides jaborosalac-tone P and jaborosalactone 1 were promising agents interms of inducing potency and low toxicity [7].0932–0776 / 05 / 0800–0867 $ 06.00 c© 2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift fu¨r Naturforschung, Tu¨bingen · http://znaturforsch.comResults and DiscussionJaborosalactone 24 (3) was isolated as a minor com-ponent from the aerial part of J. odonelliana. TheHREIMS showed a molecular ion corresponding to theformula C28H36O6, whereas the EIMS showed peaksat m/z 299 (42) and 168 (31) corresponding to thecleavage between C-20-C-17 and C-23-C-12, distinc-tive for this type of structure [8]. 1H and 13C NMRchemical shift values in jaborosalactone 24 (3) wereclosely related to those reported for jaborosalactoneP (1) [5]. In the low-field end of the 1H NMR spec-trum signals at δ = 5.81, 6.73 and 5.56 were as-signed to H-2, H-3 and H-6, respectively, of a 1-oxo-2,5-dienewithanolide. The typical pattern of the spi-ranoid arrangement was inferred from the resonancesof carbons 23 – 28 (Table 1) and the low-field 1H res-onances of methyls 27 and 28, observed as quartets(J = 1.0 Hz) due to their mutual homoallylic cou-pling. Despite these similarities, detailed comparisonof the NMR spectral data of 1 and 3 showed smallbut clear differences in the 13C chemical shifts of theα,β -unsaturated-γ-lactone ring, and a downfield shiftof H-22. This indicated that the side chain of jaborosa-lactone 24 (3) had an arrangement different from thatfound in 1, possibly due to an inverted stereochem-istry of the spiranoid center at C-23. The configurationat C-23 was confirmed to be R by comparison of theNOESY spectra of 1 and 3. Thus, the correlation ob-served for the pair H-28/H-22 in the NOESY spectrum868 A. M. Cirigliano – R. I.

The1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 4 were very simi-lar to those of jaborosalactone 2 (2) [6], however theabsence of a singlet for H-21 in the high-field end ofthe 1H NMR spectrum and the appearance of an ABquartet at 4.21 – 4.33 ppm indicated the presence of anisolated C-21 hydroxymethylene group. This function-ality has been previously found in jaborosalactones 4and 5 isolated from J. runcinata [6]. The 13C NMRspectrum (Table 1) showed only four methyl groupsthat were coincident with C-18, C-19, C-27 and C-28in 2. The methylene signal at 58.2 ppm confirmed thepresence of a hydroxyl group at C-21. The molecularion was absent in the EIMS, but a peak at m/z 480 (1%)corresponding to the ion [M-H2O]+ was observed. Asignificant fragment was at m/z 355 (4%), correspond-ing to the cleavage between C-23 and C-22 and thesubsequent loss of the γ-lactone ring and CO. TheFABMS (glycerol) of jaborosalactone 25 (4) showeda [M+1]+ ion at m/z 499 consistent with the formulaC28H34O8.Experimental SectionGeneral experimental procedures1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC-200 NMR spectrometer at 200.13 and 50.32 MHz, respec-tively, or a Bruker AM-500 at 500.13 and 125.77 MHz, re-spectively. Multiplicity determinations (DEPT-135) and 2Dspectra (COSY-45 and NOESY) were obtained using stan-dard Bruker software. Chemical shifts are given in (δ ) down-field from TMS as internal standard. EIMS were collectedon a VG Trio-2 mass spectrometer at 70 eV by direct in-let; FABMS and HREIMS (70 eV) were measured on a VGZAB-BEQQ mass spectrometer. IR and UV spectra weremeasured on a Nicolet Magna 550 FT IR and a Hewlett-Packard 8451A spectrophotometer, respectively. AM1 calcu-lations were performed with the MOPAC module in Chem3D8.0 (Cambridge Soft). Melting points were taken on a Fisher-Johns apparatus and are uncorrected. HPLC separations werecarried out on a YMC-Pack ODS-AQ column (250×10 mmID) and a mixture of MeOH – H2O (70:30) as eluant, withUV detection at 245 nm. Vacuum liquid chromatography(VLC) and column flash chromatography were carried out onKieselgel 60-G (Merck) and Kieselgel S 0.040 – 0.063 mm,respectively. TLC analysis was performed on silica gel 60F254 (0.2 mm thick).A. M. Cirigliano – R. I. Misico · Spiranoid Withanolides from Jaborosa odonelliana and Jaborosa runcinata 869Plant materialWhole J. runcinata plants were collected in March 1995in El Jagu¨el, departamento Parana´, Entre Rı´os Province, Ar-gentina. Aerial parts of J. odonelliana were collected inApril and December 1996 in Salta Province, Argentina.Voucher specimens of both species are deposited at theMuseo Bota´nico, Universidad Nacional de Co´rdoba un-der No. CORD 248 (J. runcinata) and CORD No. 25540(J. odonelliana).Extraction and isolationLeaves and stems (1.15 g) of J. odonelliana were ex-tracted as previously described [8]. The residue obtained af-ter evaporation of the combined extracts was initially frac-tionated by vacuum liquid chromatography using hexane-EtOAc mixtures of increasing polarity (100:0-0:100) as elu-ant.The fraction eluted with hexane-EtOAc (40:60) was fur-ther fractionated by flash chromatography and purified byHPLC yielding jaborosalactone P (1) (176 mg) and jaboros-alactone 24 (3) (3.4 mg).The dried and pulverized aerial parts of J. runcinata(935 mg) were extracted and fractionated as previously de-scribed [6]. The fraction eluted with hexane-EtOAc (20:80)was further purified by flash chromatography using mixturesof CH2Cl2 – MeOH (100:5-100:10) yielding jaborosalactone25 (4) (4.5 mg).Jaborosalactone 24 (3)Amorphous solid. – UV/vis (MeOH): λmax(logε) =223 nm (3.07). – IR (dry film): ν˜ = 3458, 2966, 1747,1676, 1390, 1270, 1006, 728 cm−1; 1H NMR (500.13 MHz,CDCl3, assignments based on 1H-1H-COSY): δ = 1.06 (s,3H, 18-H), 1.16 (d, J = 6.4 Hz, 1H, 21-H), 1.16 (s, 3H,19-H), 1.48 (m, 1H, 11β–H), 1.80 (m, 1H, 7α-H), 1.99 (q,J = 1.0 Hz, 3H, 27-H), 2.02 (m, 1H, 7β–H), 2.09 (m, 1H,H-20), 2.15 (q, J = 1.0 Hz, 3H, 28-H), 2.46 (dd, J = 10.4,2.6 Hz, 1H, 11α–H), 2.83 (dd, J = 21.0, 5.0 Hz, 1H, 4α–H),3.24 (dt, J = 21.0, 2.5 Hz, 1H, 4β -H), 4.03 (d, J = 11.1 Hz,1H, 22-H), 5.56 (dd, J = 4.1, 2.0 Hz, 1H, 6-H), 5.81 (dd,J = 10.0, 2.5 Hz, 1H, 2-H), 6.73 (ddd, J = 10.0, 5.0, 2.5 Hz,1H, 3-H). – 13C NMR (125.77 MHz) see Table 1. – MS(EI, 70 eV): m/z (%) = 468 (4) [M+], 450 (2), 432 (2),299 (42), 283 (10), 265 (4), 168 (31), 107 (18), 97 (21),43 (100); HREIMS m/z= 468.2512 [M+] (C28H36O6, re-quires 468.2516).Jaborosalactone 25 (4)White solid. – Mp 253 – 255 ◦C. – UV/vis (MeOH):λmax(logε) = 226 nm (3.25). – IR (dry film): ν˜ =3450, 1742, 1673, 1381, 1254, 1018 cm−1. – 1H NMR(200.13 MHz, CDCl3, assignments based on 1H-1H-COSY):δ = 1.14 (s, 3H, 18-H), 1.26 (s, 3H, 19-H), 2.03 (q, J =1.0 Hz, 3H, 27-H), 2.10 (dd, J = 19.2, 5.0 Hz, 1H, H-4α),2.25 (q, J = 1.0 Hz, 3H, 28-H), 2.64 (m, 1H, 16-H), 3.25(dt, J = 19.2, 2.2 Hz, 1H, 4β -H), 3.66 (t, J = 2.6 Hz, 1H,6-H), 4.21 (d, J = 12.2 Hz, 1H, 21b-H), 4.33 (d, J = 12.3 Hz,1H, 21a-H), 5.82 (dd, J = 10.1, 2.2 Hz, 1H, 2-H), 6.60 (ddd,J = 10.1, 5.0, 2.2 Hz, 1H, 3-H). – 13C NMR (50.32 MHz) seeTable 1. – MS (EI, 70 eV): m/z (%)= 480 (1) [M+- H2O] (1),355 (4), 107 (10), 97 (20), 43 (100); FABMS (glycerol) m/z499 [M+H]+.AcknowledgementsWe thank the late Prof. A.
