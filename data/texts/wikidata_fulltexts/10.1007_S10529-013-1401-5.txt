Abstract Non-transformed wild type (NTWT) and
hairy root cultures of Rhodiola kirilowii were grown in
medium supplemented with 2.5 mM cinnamyl alcohol
as a precursor and/or sucrose (1 %) on the day of
inoculation or on the 14th day of culture. Rosarin,
rosavin, and rosin were produced by NTWT root
culture but only rosarin and rosavin by hairy roots.
Approximately 80 and 95 % of the glycosides were
released into the medium for NTWT and hairy root
cultures, respectively. The highest rosavin yield,
505 ± 106 mg/l, was in hairy root culture when
cinnamyl alcohol was applied on the day of inocula-
tion with the addition of sucrose on the 14th day of
culture. For rosin production, supplementation with
cinnamyl alcohol alone on day 14 was more favour-
able with the highest amount 74 ± 10 mg/l in NTWT
root culture. Only traces of rosarin were detected.

Introduction
Rhodiola kirilowii (Crassulaceae) is a medicinal plant
that grows wild in Asia and Eastern Europe. Its roots
and rhizomes contain over 49 different bioactive
chemicals (Krajewska-Patan et al. 2008). Among
these, the most important are salidroside—a tyrosol
glycoside and cinnamyl alcohol glycosides, including
rosavin, rosin and rosarin (Fig. 1), usually referred to
as rosavins. Different biological activities are attrib-
uted to these compounds, such as adaptogenic (Pan-
ossian and Wikman 2009), antiviral (Zuo et al. 2007),
neuroprotective (Yu et al. 2010), immunity-increasing
(Wo´jcik et al. 2009), and antitumor activities (Zda-
nowski et al. 2012).
Rosavin production in Rhodiola is restricted to only
a few genera. Biosynthesis (Fig. 2) of phenolic glyco-
sides occurs spontaneously in Rhodiola roots and
rhizomes (Krajewska-Patan et al. 2013). Therefore,
our study focused on the glycosylation of trans-
cinnamyl alcohol into rosavins by the non-transformed
wild type (NTWT) and hairy root cultures. To date,
hairy root cultures are preferred over plant cell/callus
and suspension cultures owing to their genetic/bio-
chemical stability, hormone autotrophy, multienzyme

biosynthetic potential (representing that of the parent
plants), and relatively low-cost cultural requirements
(Banerjee et al. 2012).
Biotransformation process is useful for enhancing
and extending the production of desirable products
and is independent of the kind of plant culture used
(Giri et al. 2003; Shilpa et al. 2010). Moreover,
biotransformation allows changes to phytomolecules
that are not realistically attainable by chemical
semisynthesis (Banerjee et al. 2012). The content of
salidroside in Rhodiola spp. has been enhanced
(Krajewska-Patan et al. 2007a; Xu et al. 1998a, b;
Wu et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2007) but only a few papers
(Furmanowa et al. 1999; Gyo¨rgy et al. 2004, 2005;
Krajewska-Patan et al. 2007b) have discussed the
biotransformation of cinnamyl alcohol to rosavins.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
aimed at developing a satisfactory strategy for signif-
icantly enhancing rosavin production in NTWT and
hairy R. kirilowii root cultures. Moreover, this report is
the first to show that cinnamyl glycosides are mostly
released into the culture medium.
Materials and methods
Experimental materials
Non-transformedwild type (NTWT) root culture
Seeds of R. kirilowii were collected from the Medic-
inal Plant Garden of the Institute of Natural Fibres and
Medicinal Plants in Poznan, Poland. They were
germinated in vitro on Linsmaier and Skoog solid
medium (Linsmaier and Skoog 1965) without growth
regulators, consisting of 3 % (w/v) sucrose and
0.78 % (w/v) agar, in the dark at 24 C. Then shoot
tips were excised from the in vitro-germinated
seedlings and rooted on LS medium supplemented
with 10 mg adenine sulfate/l, 1 ml kinetin/l, 5 ml
indole-3-butyric acid/l, 3 % (w/v) sucrose, and solid-
ified with 0.78 % (w/v) agar. NTWT root culture was
established from roots derived from 1-month-old
plantlets. The roots were cultured in 20 ml LS liquid
medium supplemented with 10 mg adenine sulphate/l,
1 mg kinetin/l, and 5 mg indole-3-butyric acid/l with

shaking at 105 rpm and 24 C in the dark. Every
4 weeks, 0.4 ± 0.07 g of fresh weight of roots was
transferred into a fresh LS medium.
Hairy root culture
Hairy roots were established by infection of the R.
kirilowii plantlets with Agrobacterium rhizogenes
LBA 9402 (Zych et al. 2008) that had been grown in
50 ml YEB solid medium (Vervilet et al. 1975) for
72 h at 24 C in the dark at 105 rpm. The cultures was
diluted (1:4) with YEB liquid medium before trans-
formation. The plantlets were directly wounded with
sterile needles containing the bacterial suspension.
Hairy roots appeared 11 days after initial infection.
Each root that emerged from the place of infection was
excised and cultivated as a separate hairy root line.
The transformation process was confirmed by PCR.
DNA analysis showed that rol B gene and aux 1 gene
from Ri plasmid of A. rhizogenes were incorporated
into the plant genome of R. kirilowii.
The best growing transformed root clone (RKTR1)
was used. Hairy roots culture were grown in Erlen-
meyer flasks containing 20 ml modified DCR medium
(Gupta and Durzan 1985) without phytohormones at
105 rpm in the dark at 24 C. Every 4 weeks,
0.4 ± 0.06 g of roots was subcultured on to fresh
DCR medium.
Growth kinetics experiments
Biomass growth curves for the NTWT and hairy root
cultures were determined in parallel. From day 3
through day 27, 3 flasks were collected from each
treatment every 3 days. The roots were washed with
deionized water and blotted dry. Next, the roots were
lyophilized, and the dry weight (DW) was recorded.
The root biomass increase was expressed as the ratio
of final weight to initial weight. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.
Enhancement of rosavin production
To enhance rosavin production, a cinnamyl alcohol
(CA) and/or sucrose feeding strategy was applied.
Four types of experiments were performed: (1) CA
was added to the medium on the day of inoculation to
give 2.5 mM; (2) CA (2.5 mM) was added to the
medium on the day of inoculation and the medium was
further supplemented with 1 %, (w/v) sucrose on the
14th day of culture; (3) CA (2.5 mM) was added to the
medium on the 14th day of culture; (4) sucrose (1 %)
and CA (2.5 mM) were both added on the 14th day of
culture.
NTWT and hairy root cultures growing in unsup-
plemented medium were used as control cultures.
Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Ten
flasks were taken for each type of culture at the end of
the 28 day growth cycle.
Chemical analysis
The extraction method of Wiedenfeld et al. (2007)
was applied to lyophilized roots and post-culture
media used for extraction. Root samples were soni-
cated in methanol using a Baldin Sonorex system.
Extraction was performed three times for 30 min at
40 C. The extracts were evaporated, and the dry
residue was partitioned between carbon tetrachloride/
methanol/water (5:4:1, by vol.). The methanol/water
extract was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was
dissolved in n-butanol/water, separated into two
fractions, and evaporated. Lyophilized post-culture
media were dissolved in methanol, filtered, and
evaporated. The steps that followed were the same
as those used for root analysis. The dry residue from
each fraction was dissolved in methanol and analysed
by HPLC using a C18 column and gradient eluting
with acetonitrile/phosphoric acid/methanol (from
7:85:8 to 20:60:20, by vol.) at 1 ml/min over
30 min. The eluent was monitored at 205, 220, 250,
and 275 nm. Cinnamyl alcohol, rosarin, rosavin, and
rosin were used as standards and were analysed under
the same conditions. Peaks were assigned by spiking
the samples with standards and by comparison of the
retention times and UV spectra. Mean (n = 30)
and ± standard error were calculated for each exper-
iment. The results were analysed using STATISTICA
PL 10.
Statistical analysis
The data obtained from each experiment were ana-
lysed using the Kruskal–Wallis and Tukey tests. The
differences between analysed natural and hairy root
cultures were compared using the Mann–Whitney test.
P \ 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically
significant differences.

Results and discussion
Non-transformed wild type (NTWT) and hairy
root growth
NTWT and hairy roots varied in their growth require-
ments with respect to the mineral composition of the
applied LS or DCR media. For cultivation of NTWT
roots, LS medium proved the most suitable while no
biomass increase was observed in DCR medium. In
contrast, DCR medium promoted the best growth of
hairy roots (data not shown).
In both hairy and NTWT root control cultures the
stationary growth phase began on the 18th day of
culture (Fig. 3). Hairy roots had higher fresh and dry
growth rates (final/inoculum) than NTWT roots (58
and 54 %, respectively. As measurement of the dry
weight was more accurate than that of the fresh
weight, this was used in subsequent work.
Cinnamyl alcohol (CA) adversely affected growth
hairy and NTWT root. Hairy root culture fed with CA
on the day of inoculation showed a 55 % growth
inhibition in comparison to control while those fed the
CA on the 14th day after inoculation showed a 44 %
decrease. The addition of CA on the day of inoculation
and sucrose on day 14 of culture resulted in 57 %
growth decrease. Supplementation with CA and
sucrose on the day 14 caused a 38 % fall in biomass
accumulation.
Growth of NTWT root culture was inhibited by 48
and 40 % in comparison to the control when CA was
added on the day of inoculation or on the 14th day of
the growth cycle, respectively. When the medium was
fed with CA on the day of inoculation and sucrose on
day 14 culture root growth was reduced by 51 and by
37 % when CA and sucrose were added to the medium
together on day 14.
The correlation between biomass increase and the
biotransformation reaction has been discussed by
Gyo¨rgy et al. (2004) in compact callus aggregate
culture. The decrease in biomass growth was from 20
to 50 % when CA was at 0.05 or 5 mM, respectively.
In a further study, Gyo¨rgy et al. (2005) observed that
addition of both glucose and sucrose to the culture
medium did not improve the accumulation of compact
callus aggregate tissue biomass. Our results showed
that supplying additional sucrose to the culture
medium did not have a significant effect on the growth
of NTWT and hairy root cultures of R. kirilowii.
Production of cinnamyl alcohol glycosides
CA and rosavins were not detected in NTWT and hairy
root cultures maintained in control media. In all the
experiments, the addition of exogenous CA to the media
induced the production of cinnamyl alcohol glycosides.
However, significant variation was observed in the
amounts of the investigated compounds detected, in
accordance with the type of cultivated roots and the
experimental strategy used.
Phytochemical analyses of the NTWT roots
showed the presence of all three rosavins, with the
Fig. 3 Dry biomass increase in R. kirilowii non-transformed
wild type (NTWTR) and hairy (HR) root cultures. Non-
transformed wild type roots were cultivated in LS liquid
medium (Linsmaier and Skoog 1965) supplemented with 10 mg/l
adenine sulphate, 1 mg/l kinetin, and 5 mg/l indole-3-butyric
acid. Hairy roots were cultured in modified hormone free DCR
liquid medium (Gupta and Durzan 1985)

highest being rosin at 3 ± 0.4 mg/g DW (Table 1).
The rosavin yield was 2.6 ± 0.3 mg/g DW, while the
rosarin yield 0.09 ± 0.02 mg/g DW. The addition of
sucrose alone to the culture on day 14 after inoculation
increased production of rosavins (Table 1). Rosin
production was 40 % higher (5 ± 0.7 mg/g DW)
relative to the level noted in the first experiment.
Increases in rosavin and rosarin concentration reached
3.4 ± 0.8 and 0.12 ± 0.04 mg/g DW, respectively.
The highest conversion of exogenous CA to rosavin by
NTWT root culture (6.4 ± 0.4 mg/g) was when the
roots were fed with CA on day 14 (Table 1). However,
this led to lower amounts of rosarin and rosin
0.07 ± 0.01 and 4.6 ± 1 mg/g, respectively. Medium
supplementation with both CA and sucrose on day 14
inhibited rosin and rosarin production. The accumu-
lation of rosin (3.4 ± 1 mg/g DW) was 34 % lower in
comparison to its level when CA was added on the day
of inoculation followed by sucrose addition on the
14th day but was still higher than when CA was added
to the medium on the inoculation day with no further
supplementation (Table 1). The rosavin yield (6 ±
0.5 mg/g DW) was not affected by simultaneous CA
and sucrose addition on day 14. Statistical analyses
showed significant differences in rosavin production
in roots between each of the experimental conditions,
with the highest production (p = 0.0147) obtained
when CA was added on day 14. The rosarin or rosin
content was not significantly affected by the applied
feeding strategy in NTWT root cultures.
Most of the rosavin and rosin (80 %) was released
to the medium in NTWT root cultures (Table 2).
However, rosarin was not detected in the postculture
media for any of the experimental conditions. The
highest rosavin concentration (42 ± 15 mg/l) was
detected in postculture media when CA was added on
the inoculation day and additional sucrose was
provided on day 14 (Table 2), whereas rosin addition
of CA on day 14 (66 ± 20 mg/ml; Table 2). The
highest intra- and extracellular rosavin concentrations
were achieved when CA was added at the beginning of
culture, and sucrose added on day 14. The culture
requirements for rosin production differed from those
for rosavin, with the maximum total rosin accumula-
tion occurring with the addition of CA on day 14.
In contrast to the results for NTWT root culture, no
rosin production was observed in hairy root culture.
CA supplementation on the inoculation day provided
3.4 ± 0.6 and 0.4 ± 0.07 mg/g DW rosavin and
rosarin, respectively (Table 1). Addition of sucrose
to the culture on day 14 led to a 50 % increase in
rosavin production to 6.7 ± 0.7 mg/g DW, while the
rosarin concentration was not affected (0.3 ± 0.1 mg/g
DW). Under the third set of experimental conditions
(addition of CA on day 14), the observed rosavin level
was markedly high, reaching 9.8 ± 0.2 mg/g DW
(Table 1); this was the highest yield of this glycoside
detected in roots in all the experiments. Culture
supplementation with both CA and sucrose on day 14
diminished rosavin accumulation in hairy roots by
45 % to 5.4 ± 2 mg/g DW. In contrast, the combined
addition of CA and sucrose on day 14 increased the
yield of rosarin to 0.08 ± 0.02 mg/g DW (p = 0.01).
In hairy root culture over 95 % of the rosavin
cinnamyl glycoside content was released to the media
(Table 2), whereas rosarin and rosin could not be
detected in any of the postculture media. When
exogenous CA was added on the inoculation day,
extracellular rosavin reached 272 ± 12 mg/l that is
97 % higher than its intracellular yield (calculated as

extracellular\intracellular content; Table 2). The
extracellular rosavin content in hairy root cultures
was also 87 % higher than the results of analyses of
post culture media from NTWT root culture. When
sucrose was added on day 14 the amount of rosavin in
the media increased up to 491 ± 94 mg/l, that is 97 %
higher than that in the roots and 91 % more than that in
the postculture media of NTWT roots maintained
under the same conditions (Table 2).
Similar to the results for NTWT root culture, the
highest intra- and extra-cellular rosavin contents were
detected when CA was added on the inoculation day,
followed by sucrose addition on day 14 (Table 2). In
contrast to the results for NTWT root culture, rosin
production was not observed in the hairy root culture,
while rosavin and rosarin production was higher. Statis-
tical analyses showed highly significant differences
between the precursor application strategy and/or sucrose
feeding between hairy and NTWT types of culture.
The plant cells are factories producing a wide
spectrum of secondary metabolites and the majority of
them are considered as potent drug candidates. One of the
biotechnological strategies, the biotransformation pro-
cess has been developed. Until now, biotransformation
has contributed to an increase of excepted rosavins in
callus culture, suspension cell culture of Rhodiola spp.
has been reported (Furmanowa et al. 1999; Gyo¨rgy et al.
2004, 2005; Krajewska-Patan et al. 2007b). Furmanowa
et al. (1999) measured the glycosylation level of
exogenously applied CA (2.5 mM) in R. rosea cell
suspension culture. Their results indicated that 90 % of
the CA used as the substrate for biotransformation was
converted by the cells to a number of constituents,
including rosavin, up to 1 % within 72 h. Our results
showed that conversion of CA was over 94 % and 96 %
for the NTWT and hairy root cultures, respectively.
In studies involving R. rosea compact callus
aggregate liquid culture, Gyo¨rgy et al. (2004)
observed that optimal concentration of CA was
2 mM for rosin production. It increased by 1.25 %.
The highest rosavin, 0.083 % was in the presence of
0.1 mM CA. Moreover, no rosarin was detected. The
data presented in our study show that for rosavin
production in both NTWT and hairy root cultures, the
most favourable concentration of CA was 2.5 mM.
In further studies, Gyo¨rgy et al. (2005) investigated
the sucrose and/or glucose feeding. Rosavin was not
produced at all when only sucrose was added but the

rosin yield increased to 0.54 % when 10 g glucose
and 2 mM CA were applied. Moreover, four new
unexpected rosavin derivatives were detected. Never-
theless, the rosavin yield was still very low, reaching a
maximum of 0.015 %.
Krajewska-Patan et al. (2007b) examined the bio-
transformation capacity of R. rosea compact callus
aggregate culture. Compact callus aggregate main-
tained on solid medium after 2.5 mM CA addition
produced the whole spectrum of active compounds
present in the intact plant: salidroside, p-tyrosol,
rosavins, and chlorogenic and gallic acids. However,
the rosin and rosavin levels (1.06 and 0.15 % respec-
tively) were significantly lower.
Conclusions
Rhodiola kirilowii root cultures are capable of bio-
transformation reactions. Hairy R. kirilowii root cul-
tures could be considered as a more potent and
abundant source of rosavin than NTWT root cultures.
Without exogenous CA supplementation, none of
the examined phenolic glycosides were formed in
roots or secreted to the post culture media. Addition of
CA enabled rosarin, rosavin, and rosin production in
NTWT root cultures and rosarin and rosin production
in hairy cultures. Moreover, we have demonstrated
that feeding cultures with CA on the inoculation day
and additional sucrose on day 14 of the growth cycle
resulted in increased rosavin production. For rosin
accumulation, the most advantageous strategy is the
addition of CA alone on day 14. Rosarin was detected
only in similar trace amounts in NTWT and hairy root
cultures. Regardless of the experiment type, 80–95 %
of glycosides were released to the media in NTWT and
hairy root cultures. Taken together, the biotransfor-
mation process could constitute an effective tool in the
stimulation of the important biologically active com-
pounds in plant material obtained via biotechnological
methods.
