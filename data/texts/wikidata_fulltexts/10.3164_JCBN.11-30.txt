Excess production of nitric oxide by activated macrophages via
inducible nitric oxide synthase leads to the development of
various inflammatory diseases. Heme oxygenase 1 expression via
activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 inhibits
nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase expres 
sion in activated macrophages. Okanin is one of the most abundant
chalcones found in the genus Bidens (Asteraceae) that is used as
various folk medications in Korea and China for treating inflam 
mation. Here, we found that okanin (possessing the α β unsatu 
rated carbonyl group) induced heme oxygenase 1 expression via
nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 activation in RAW264.7
macrophages. 3 Penten 2 one, of which structure, as in okanin,
possesses the α β unsaturated carbonyl group, also induced
nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 dependent heme
oxygenase 1 expression, while both 2 pentanone (lacking a
double bond) and 2 pentene (lacking a carbonyl group) were
virtually inactive. In lipopolysaccharide activated RAW264.7 macro 
phages, both okanin and 3 penten 2 one inhibited nitric oxide
production and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression via
heme oxygenase 1 expression. Collectively, our findings suggest
that by virtue of its α β unsaturated carbonyl functional group,
okanin can inhibit nitric oxide production and inducible nitric
oxide synthase expression via nuclear factor erythroid 2 related
factor 2 dependent heme oxygenase 1 expression in lipopolysac 
charide activated macrophages.

Introduction Okanin (chemical structure shown in Fig. 1) is one of the most
abundant chalcone [1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one] compounds
found in the genus Bidens (Asteraceae) that has been used as
various folk medications in Korea and China for treating inflam-
mation, malaria, hypertension, diabetes, peptic ulcer, snake bite
and smallpox.(1–3) Although ethnopharmacological studies carried
out with plants of the genus Bidens have demonstrated anti-
inflammatory activity,(4–10) whether okanin would also have
anti-inflammatory activity is not yet investigated.
Activated macrophages play a pivotal role in a variety of
inflammatory diseases via the excess production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and the prolonged expression of inducible
pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS).(11,12) The inflammatory enzyme iNOS, once expressed in
activated macrophages, can generate a large amount of nitric oxide
(NO) for a long period.(11,12) The free radical NO has been
implicated as an important inflammatory mediator in the process
of macrophage-mediated inflammation.(12) However, uncontrolled/
excess NO production by activated macrophages leads to the
development of various inflammatory diseases.(12,13) Hence,
pharmacological inhibition of NO production and/or iNOS
expression is a promising strategy for reducing the potentially
harmful pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages.(13)
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible enzyme that
catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of free heme into
carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin, which is subsequently
catabolized into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.(14) In addition
to its primary role in heme degradation, HO-1 has been also
recognized to play other important roles in resolution of inflam-
mation, which has been demonstrated in HO-1 knockout mice and
a human case of genetic HO-1 deficiency.(15,16) Particularly, HO-1
and its enzymatic metabolites are the critical regulators of
inflammation, with activated macrophages acting as the critical
targets.(14–16) Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a
redox sensitive transcription factor that is critical for induction of
the gene encoding HO-1.(17) Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is
sequestered in the cytoplasm by forming a complex with the
negative regulator of Nrf2, Klech-like ECH-associated protein 1
(Keap1).(17) This complex is disrupted by several naturally occurring
compounds, and Nrf2 is liberated and translocated to the nucleus
where it binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences
in the ho-1 gene promoter.(18,19)
Recently, a series of naturally occurring compounds from
medicinal plants have been reported to induce HO-1 expression in
different cell types, and in some of these studies, HO-1 has been
shown to mediate their anti-inflammatory properties through
inhibition of NO production and iNOS expression.(20–24) In the
present study, we have also reported that okanin inhibited NO
production and iNOS expression through Nrf2-dependent HO-1

expression in RAW264.7 macrophages activated with the endo-
toxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents. Previously, we had isolated okanin
from the ethanol extract of the flowers of Bidens bipinnata L.(25)
and this compound was used in this study. 3-Penten-2-one, 2-
pentanone, 2-pentene, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), hemin, LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5), 3-(4,5-dimethyl-
2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), N-acetyl-L-
cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Antibodies against iNOS, HO-1, Nrf2, lamin B and β-actin
and small interfering RNA (siRNA) products against Nrf2 and
HO-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). All other reagents used were of analytical grade.
Cell culture. RAW264.7 macrophages were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine,
antibiotics (100 U/ml of penicillin A and 100 U/ml of strepto-
mycin) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL,
Rockville, MD) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined by a
modified MTT reduction assay. MTT is a pale yellow substance
that is reduced by living cells to yield a dark blue formazan
product. This process requires active mitochondria, and even fresh
dead cells do not reduce significant amounts of MTT. RAW264.7
macrophages were cultured in a 96-well flat-bottom plate at
concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. After 12 h of preconditioning,
the cells were treated with various concentrations of okanin for
24 h. Thereafter, culture medium was aspirated and 100 μl of
MTT dye (1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added; the
cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The formazan crystals
produced through dye reduction by viable cells were dissolved
using acidified isopropanol (0.1 N HCl). Index of cell viability
was calculated by measuring the optical density of color produced
by MTT dye reduction at 570 nm.
Nitrite assay. The nitrite concentration in the medium was
measured as an indicator of NO production according to the Griess
reaction. One hundred microliters of each supernatant was mixed
with the same volume of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide in 5%
phosphoric acid and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydro-
chloride in water); absorbance of the mixture at 550 nm was
determined with an ELISA plate reader.
Western blot analysis. RAW264.7 macrophages were incu-
bated with or without reagents. They were harvested, washed ice-
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and kept on ice for 1 min.
The suspension was mixed with buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,
10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μ/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml
leupeptin) and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cytosolic frac-
tion was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at
4°C. The pellets were re-suspended in buffer C (20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml
leupeptin) on ice for 40 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for
20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was used as soluble
nuclear fraction. Protein content was determined with BCA pro-
tein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total cellular or nuclear
fractions were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and
transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Bio-
sciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was then blocked
in blocking buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk
for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the membrane was
incubated with antibodies against HO-1 (1:1000 dilution), Nrf2
(1:500 dilution), iNOS (1:1000 dilution), lamin B (1:1000 dilution)
or β-actin (1:1000 dilution) at 4°C overnight. The membrane was
then washed four times with PBS-Tween 20 buffer and further
incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
Specific bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane
was exposed to X-ray film.
Transfection of siRNA. RAW264.7 macrophages were
grown in 6- or 12-well plates and transiently transfected with Nrf2
siRNA or HO-1 siRNA mixed with siRNA transfection reagent
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 30 h, cells
were treated with reagents. The samples were then prepared for
Western blot analysis.
Nrf2 ARE binding assay. The amount of Nrf2 available in
the nucleus to bind to AREs was determined using the ELISA-
based TransAMTM Nrf2 Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly,
nuclear extracts were added to wells containing the immobilized
consensus ARE oligonucleotide. A primary antibody against Nrf2
was added to each well. Then a secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase that binds to the primary antibody was
added to each well. The signal was detected at 450 nm, and Nrf2-
ARE binding was reported as optical density (OD) units at
450 nm.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as means ± SE. One-
way analysis of variance procedures were used to assess signifi-
cant differences among treatment groups. For each treatment
showing a statistically significant effect, the Newman-Keuls test
was used for comparisons of multiple group means. The criterion
for statistical significance was set at p<0.05 or 0.01.
Results
Okanin and 3 penten 2 one, but not 2 pentanone and 2 
pentene, can induce HO 1 expression. The chemical struc-
tures of okanin and other three synthetic compounds tested in this
study are shown in Fig. 1. Both okanin and 3-penten-2-one contain
an  α-β unsaturated carbonyl group in the central five-carbon
chain. In comparison with 3-penten-2-one, 2-pentanone and 2-
pentene lack a double bond and a carbonyl group, respectively. 3-
penten-2-one, 2-pentanone and 2-pentene were used to explore a
possible mechanism of action of okanin. In RAW264.7 macro-
phages, okanin and 3-penten-2-one, but not 2-pentanone and 2-
pentene, exhibited cytotoxicity at more than 40 μM (data not
shown).
Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with non-cytotoxic
concentrations of okanin (0.5–10 μM) for 6 h resulted in a

concentration-dependent increase in HO-1 protein levels, as
confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Induction of HO-1
expression by okanin was robust at 6 h and slightly decreased over
time (Fig. 2B). Similarly, treatment with 3-penten-2-one for 6 h
resulted in a marked increase in HO-1 protein levels (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, neither 2-pentanone nor 2-pentene induced HO-1 expres-
sion (Fig. 2C).
Okanin and 3 penten 2 one can induce Nrf2 activation
that mediates HO 1 expression. A time-dependent increase
in Nrf2 protein in the nucleus, along with a significant decrease in
Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm, was observed when RAW264.7
macrophages were incubated with 10 μM okanin (Fig. 3A).
Similarly, 3-penten-2-one also increased levels of nucleus Nrf2
protein (not shown). To study Nrf2 activation, the nuclear extracts
of RAW264.7 macrophages were isolated and the binding of Nrf2
to ARE was quantified by using a TransAMTM assay. Both okanin
and 3-penten-2-one increased Nrf2 activation, whereas 2-pentanone
and 2-pentene had no significant effect on Nrf2 activation
(Fig. 3B). We next conducted the experiments of Nrf2 knockdown
by using siRNA to investigate whether HO-1 expression would be
inhibited. HO-1 expression by okanin and 3-penten-2-one was
prevented by siRNA against Nrf2 (Fig. 3C).
Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression in RAW264.7 macro-
phages observed with okanin and 3-penten-2-one may be attribut-
able to changes in the production of reactive oxygen species and
the redox environment, and/or to direct thiol modification of
Keap1 and other proteins.(26) To better characterize Nrf2 activation
and HO-1 expression, we treated normal RAW264.7 macrophages

with high concentrations of NAC, a thiol donor, along with okanin
and 3-penten-2-one. The NAC treatment partially inhibited Nrf2
activation (Fig. 4A) and HO-1 expression (Fig. 4B) by okanin and
3-penten-2-one.
Okanin and 3 penten 2 one inhibit LPS induced NO
production and iNOS expression via HO 1 expression.
RAW264.7 macrophages were pre-incubated for 6 h with okanin
and activated with LPS. Okanin inhibited LPS-induced NO
production (Fig. 5A) and iNOS expression (Fig. 5B) in a dose-
dependent manner. Similarly, 3-penten-2-one also inhibited LPS-
induced NO production (Fig. 5C) and iNOS expression (Fig. 5D).
Unlike 3-penten-2-one, 2-pentanone and 2-pentene had no effect
on LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression (not
shown). To explore a potential involvement of HO-1 expression in
the observed inhibitory effects of okanin and 3-penten-2-one on
LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression, siRNA against
HO-1 was used to inhibit cellular synthesis of HO-1 protein. As
shown in Fig. 6, inhibition of HO-1 expression by siRNA signifi-
cantly reversed the inhibitory effects of okanin and 3-penten-2-
one on LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that okanin, one of the most
abundant chalcones found in the genus Bidens (Asteraceae),
induced the expression of the anti-inflammatory HO-1 in
RAW264.7 macrophages and that HO-1 expression by okanin was
associated with its inhibition of LPS-induced NO production and
iNOS expression. We have also studied a possible mechanism
behind the HO-1 expression by okanin, and demonstrated that
HO-1 expression was dependent on Nrf2 activation.
From a chemical viewpoint, okanin consists of two hydroxy-
phenyl rings linked by a three-carbon unit forming an α-β
unsaturated carbonyl moiety (see Fig. 1). The α-β unsaturated
carbonyl group (also known as classical Michael acceptor) has
been shown to be a crucial structure of okanin, because both 2-
pentanone (lacking a double bond) and 2-pentene (lacking a
carbonyl group) were virtually inactive in inducing HO-1 expres-
sion; on the contrary, 3-penten-2-one (possessing an α-β unsatu-
rated carbonyl group) had an ability to induce HO-1 expression
(Fig. 2C). In fact, some phytochemicals carrying this reactive
functional group, such as avicins,(27) curcumin,(28) costunolide,(29)

and dehydrocostus lactone,(30) have been reported to induce HO-1
expression. Moreover, 2'-hydroxychalcone, of which chemical
structure is similar to that of okanin with the exception of four
hydroxyl substituents on two aromatic rings, has been previously
reported to induce HO-1 expression in RAW264.7 macro-
phages,(31) implying that okanin would have a chemical property
resembling that of 2'-hydroxychalcone. Thus, we speculate that
okanin may be effective in inducing HO-1 expression, at least in
part, because it bears the α-β unsaturated carbonyl group.
At present, the mechanism(s) by which the α-β unsaturated
carbonyl group of okanin is capable of inducing HO-1 expression
is not clear. It has been hypothesized that compounds containing
the α-β unsaturated carbonyl group may cause the disruption of
the Keap1-Nrf2 complex, most likely through interaction with the
thiols present on Keap1, thereby resulting in Nrf2 activation.(32–34)
This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that Nrf2
activation by okanin was partially abrogated by high concentra-
tions of NAC (Fig. 4A). Presumably, the reaction of okanin with a
large excess of NAC may result in reversible formation of the
thiol-okanin product, allowing for a limited amount of free okanin
to be available for interaction with Keap1. Additionally, there are
many experimental studies showing that α-β unsaturated carbonyl-
containing compounds are capable of inducing HO-1 expression
through Nrf2 nuclear translocation.(27,29,30,32) Thus, the present
study examined whether okanin would also activate Nrf2 nuclear
translocation in RAW264.7 macrophages. Indeed, both okanin
and its core component (i.e., 3-penten-2-one) induced Nrf2
nuclear translocation, and in turn increased Nrf2-ARE biding
activity. Moreover, Nrf2 activation by okanin was associated with
HO-1 expression, because RAW264.7 macrophages in which the
cellular synthesis of Nrf2 was suppressed by siRNA did not
display any change in HO-1 expression following exposure to
okanin (Fig. 3C). Our results, therefore, suggest that HO-1 expres-
sion by okanin may occur through the Nrf2-dependent pathway.
HO-1 represents a major protective factor because of its anti-
oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.(14–16) It has been shown
that HO-1 expression has anti-inflammatory effects that are
presumably mediated by its enzymatic metabolites, such as carbon
monoxide and biliverdin/bilirubin.(35,36) In activated macrophages,
HO-1 expression has been shown to inhibit the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and the expression of pro-inflammatory
enzymes, including iNOS.(36) Our data shows that knocking down
HO-1 largely blocked the inhibition of okanin and its core
component (i.e., 3-penten-2-one) on NO production and iNOS
expression in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 6),
suggesting that the inhibitory effect of okanin on LPS-induced NO
production and iNOS expression may be, at least in part, mediated
through HO-1 expression. Our data are in agreement with other
studies demonstrating that HO-1 expression in activated macro-
phages has anti-inflammatory effects(37–40) and, therefore, provide
one of possible mechanisms that could explain the anti-
inflammatory effects of medicinal plants of the genus Bidens.(1–10)
In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that:
(i) okanin, one of the most abundant chalcones found in medicinal
plants of the genus Bidens, induces HO-1 expression through
Nrf2-dependent pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages; (ii) the α-β
unsaturated carbonyl functional group of okanin is crucial for
Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression; and (iii) okanin and its core
component (i.e., 3-penten-2-one) inhibit LPS-induced NO produc-
tion and iNOS expression by inducing HO-1 expression.
