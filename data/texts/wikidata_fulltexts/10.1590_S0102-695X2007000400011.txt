RESUMO: “Um desidro-rotenóide produzido por cultura de calos e por raízes de plantas 
silvestres de Boerhaavia coccinea”. Cultura de calos foram estabelecidos de folhas e galhos 
fi nos de plântula de B. coccinea produzida in vitro e analisada para isofl avonóide. A quantifi cação 
do 6,9,11-triidroxi-6a,12a-desidro-rotenóide isolado das raízes de B. coccinea P Miller, coletada 
em seu habitat natural, e do mesmo rotenóide produzido na cultura de células estão descritos 
neste artigo. A análise rotineira em CLAE mostrou que a cultura de calos produziu o mesmo 
isofl avonóide encontrado nas raízes da planta do campo. A quantidade do metabólito secundário 
produzido in vitro foi de 955.35 ȝg/g de massa seca de callus, atingindo uma concentração de 
2,5 vezes maior do que a quantidade do metabólito produzido pela planta em seu meio ambiente 
natural.

ABSTRACT: Calli cultures were established from leaves and stem of B. coccinea plantlet 
produced in vitro and analysed for isofl avonoid content. The quantifi cation of 6,9,11-trihydroxy-
6a,12a-dehydrorotenoid isolated from the roots of Boerhaavia coccinea P. Miller collected from 
its natural environment, and the same metabolite produced in callus tissue culture of the same 
plant are described in this paper. The rotinary quantitative HPLC analysis indicated that callus
culture produced the same isofl avonoid compound found in the roots of intact wild growing 
plant. The amount of the secondary metabolite produced in vitro was 955.35 ȝg/g of dry cell 
weight, 2.5 times more than the highest amount concentration produced by the wild growing 
plant in its natural environment.
Keywords: Boerhaavia coccinea, Nyctaginaceae, secondary metabolite, plant callus culture,

INTRODUCTION
The Boerhaavia genus has been chemically 
and little pharmacologically studied. The presence of 
isofl avonoids compounds is very common in the roots 
of this genus (Lami et al., 1991). Coccineone-B is an 
isofl avonoid systematically named 6,9,11-trihydroxy-
6a,12a-dehydrorotenoid that was isolated from the roots 
of wild growing Boerhaavia coccinea plant (Messana et 
al., 1986) (Figure 1).
This is a medicinal folk plant from the 
northeastern of Brazil used in the treatment of urinary 
diseases (Braga, 1960). In this study, the isofl avonoid 
was produced and accumulated in vitro using callus
tissue culture techniques and compared to the amount of 
coccineone B produced in the root of intact plant during 
different months in a year. 
The seasonal study of isofl avonoid compounds 
in the roots and calli of B coccinea brings about 
relevant information in the variation production and 
accumulation of this metabolite during different periods 
of the year. This phenomenon is followed by fl owering 
or environmental changes that turn the chemical aspects 
of the plant. In general, plants produce high amounts 
of different metabolites with diversity of biological 
activity during these kind of changes (Barbosa-Filho et

al., 2005).
This work was developed to compare the 
concentration of coccineone-B produced by calli culture 
of B. coccinea with that present in the roots of the same 
plant in its natural environment (Fedoreyev et al., 2000; 
Luczkiewicz; Glod, 2003). The results herein presented 
were obtained to evaluate the potentiality of the calli
in producing high amount of isofl avonoid compound 
during seasonal changes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant material
Roots and seeds of wild growing B. coccinea
were collected in Maceio-AL, Northeast region of 
Brazil. The specimen was certifi ed by “Instituto do Meio 
Ambiente de Alagoa-IMA”, and its voucher specimen 
was deposited at the herbarium of the IMA under the 
registry number MAC/8512. 
Establishment of callus culture
 Callus culture was initiated with explants 
prepared from aerial parts (leaves and stem) of plantlets 
obtained after in vitro seed germination. The explants 
were transferred to MS basal medium, supplemented 
with 0.5 mg of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic 
acid) L-1, 0.5 mg of BAP (benzylaminopurine) L-1, 30 
g sucrose L-1 and 10 g of agar L-1; pH was adjusted to 
5.7 (Murashige; Skoog, 1962). The cultivation was 
performed in the dark for 30 days at 27 ± 2 oC. Calluses 
emerging on the explants were excised and cultivated on 
the same medium. Subculturing was carried out every 
30 days.
Obtaining of callus samples
Callus samples (cylindrical fl ask containing 
ca 5 g of fresh callus), for isofl avonoids quantifi cation 
by HPLC analysis, were withdrawn in triplicate at the 
20th day (half of exponential phase) and submitted to 
lyophilization for 48h using a freeze-dryer at -55 oC. 
Analyses were performed by sacrifi ce sampling.
Obtaining of chromatographic standard 
coccineone-B
Coccineone-B was isolated by phytochemical 
method from roots of B. coccinea as reported by 
Messana et al. (1986).
Samples preparation for HPLC
100 mg of freeze-dried callus, and room 
temperature dried roots (200 mg) of B. coccinea were 
submitted to extractions with chloroform (1 mL x 3) 
after been powdered by a mortar and pestle, and fi ltered 
under vaccum in a whatman paper quantitative fi lter 
no 1. The chloroform extract was concentrated at room 
temperature. Prior to analysis, the dried extract was 
dissolved with 490 mL of acetonitrile and 10 mL (0.866 
mg § 9.413 ȝMol) of toluene, used as internal standard, 
and submitted to HPLC analysis.
HPLC analysis conditions
 A volume of 5 mL of sample solution was 
injected into the analytical column RP-C-18 (3.9 mm 
x 30 cm) with 10 mM particle size mBondapak. The 
HPLC was a Waters equipped with an integrator and 
a UV detector operated at 300 nm with an injector 
U6K. A pump allowed a fl ow rate of 1.5 mL min-1
using acetonitrile-water (45:55 v/v) as mobile phase 
in an isocratic mode. Standard Curve was constructed 
with a solution containing COC-B in acetonitrile in the 
concentration range from 0.3 mg mL-1 to 500 mg mL-1. Six 
different known concentrations from standard solution 
were injected separately with three replications, based 
on literature procedure (Yariwake et al., 2005; Batista 
et al., 2005; Lodhi et al., 1994). The limit detection was 
obtained using different decreasing concentratios.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
                  Three samples from callus tissue culture were 
submitted to isofl avonoids extraction procedure and 
analysed by HPLC, Table 1. The results were compared 
with the isofl avonoids seazonal producing by wild 
growing plant, Table 2. 
            The fi rst sample came from a culture growth 
with 2,4-D. This growth regulator presents a function 
of accelerate the subdivision of the cell leading rapid 
growth of the callus. The second sample came from a 
culture growth with BAP, which presented a potential to 
induce coccineone-B to be produced and accumulated 
in cell tissue culture. The third sample came from an 
experiment developed to induce the growth of the callus 
in the presence of 0.5 ȝg/L of 2,4-D and 0.5 ȝg/L of BAP. 
All calli were analysed after 20 days of maintenance in 
a solid culture medium. 
 The results showed that BAP induced high level 
of the dehydrorotenoid concentrations better than 2,4-D 
and in the mixture of 2,4-D and BAP. The relevance of 
this quantitative analysis permitted to demonstrate that 
BAP induced isofl avonoids production in higher amount 
than wild plant.
 The calli were analyzed to investigate the 
behaving of the isofl avonoid amounts to be compared 
with the same compound present in roots of B. coccinea
during the different months. Dehydrorotenoid was 
produced by roots in high amount from August to 
December. From January to July this compound was 
produced in low concentrations or were not produced

as demonstrated in February, Table 2. The absence of 
this compound or its low presence during a few months 
may be related with the rainy season, when there is a 
considerable amount of rain incidence in this Region of 
Brazil. As described by Monteiro et al. (2006), tannins 
and phenolic compounds decrease in concentration in 
the rainy season when compared to dry season. As a rule, 
it is possible to see a relation between high isofl avonoid 
concentrations in November with the beginning of 
summer. 
Calli cultures were withdrawn in triplicate for 
each experiment. As can be seen, by the relation dry 
weight/fresh weight, the friable calli presents too much 
water and the cultivation underwent 20 days, Table 1. 
Calli cultures were established from the stem of 
B. coccinea plantlets obtained from seeds germination 
in vitro that is thought to be an important goal for 
plant biotechnology. Similar strategy was developed 
by Fedoreyev et al. (2000), exploiting the analytical 
HPLC for the reproducibility of the sample analysis. 
As described by Lima et al. (2006), natural resources 
have been extensively exploited for medicinal purposes 
and a great number of plants have been employed in 
folk medicine, although the active principles are found 
in very low isolated substances concentrations. In this 
case, plant cell culture was the most effi ciente technique 
used to obtain higher amounts of active compound, that 
allowed inducing and accumulating the metabolite in a 
short time then mother plant did. 
 For this system of analysis the limit of 
detection was 0.04 mg mL-1 over the wide concentration 
range from 0.3 mg mL-1 to 500 mg mL-1, with an average 
accuracy of 99.43 ± 0.48%. Statistical calculations with 
the areas of IS, were made and a relevant result was 
obtained to confi rm the accuracy of the analysis, Table 
3.
