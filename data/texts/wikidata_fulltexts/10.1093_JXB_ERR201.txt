Abstract
Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) are a class of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a broad diversity of
secondary metabolites known as apocarotenoids. In plants, CCDs are part of a genetic family with members which
cleave speciﬁc double bonds of carotenoid molecules. CCDs are involved in the production of diverse and important
metabolites such as vitamin A and abscisic acid (ABA). Bixa orellana L. is the main source of the natural pigment
annatto or bixin, an apocarotenoid accumulated in large quantities in its seeds. Bixin biosynthesis has been studied
and the involvement of a CCD has been conﬁrmed in vitro. However, the CCD genes involved in the biosynthesis of
the wide variety of apocarotenoids found in this plant have not been well documented. In this study, a new CCD1
gene member (BoCCD1) was identiﬁed and its expression was charaterized in different plant tissues of B. orellana
plantlets and adult plants. The BoCCD1 sequence showed high homology with plant CCD1s involved mainly in the
cleavage of carotenoids in several sites to generate multiple apocarotenoid products. Here, the expression proﬁles
of the BoCCD1 gene were analysed and discussed in relation to total carotenoids and other important
apocarotenoids such as bixin.
Key words: Annatto, apocarotenoids, Bixa orellana, bixin, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, CCD1, in situ RT-PCR, pigments.
Introduction
Apocarotenoids are terpenoid compounds derived from the
oxidative cleavage of carotenoids (Wahlberg and Eklund,
1998). They are generated when the double bonds in
a carotenoid molecule are cleaved through a reaction in-
volving molecular oxygen, with the formation of an
aldehyde or ketone group in the cleavage site of each
product. Carotenoids can be cleaved at any of their
conjugated double bonds, resulting in a diverse set of
apocarotenoids (Auldridge et al., 2006). These metabolites
are widely distributed in plants, contributing to the ﬂavour
and/or aroma of ﬂowers and fruits (i.e. b-cyclocitral, a-a n d
b-damascenone, geranial, genaryl acetone, and b-ionone).
In Bixa orellana an orange-red apocarotenoid known as
bixin is accumulated in high concentrations, mainly on its
seeds, and accounts for 80% of the total carotenoids present
in the seeds (Rivera-Madrid et al., 2006). A bixin bio-
synthesis pathway has been documented in a heterologous
system (Bouvier et al., 2003); the authors identiﬁed three
B. orellana genes encoding three enzymes required for bixin
synthesis from the linear C40 lycopene: lycopene cleavage
dioxygenase (BoLCD); bixin aldehyde dehydrogenase
(BoBADH); and norbixin methyltransferase (BoBMT).
However, seed extracts contain a wide variety of apocar-
otenoids including both linear apocarotenoids [i.e. methyl
(9Z)-apo-8#-lycopenoate] and cyclic apocarotenoids [i.e.
methyl (all-E)-8#-apo-b-caroten-8#-oate] (Mercadante et al.,
1996, 1997; Bittencourt et al., 2005). Nevertheless, apocar-
otenoid proﬁles in non-seed tissues and their accumulation
patterns during different plant developmental stages remain
to be clariﬁed.

speciﬁc oxidation, biologically active forms with regulatory
functions tend to be generated via site-speciﬁc cleavage.
Several enzymes mediating the site-speciﬁc carotenoid cleav-
age are needed to generate biologically active apocarotenoids.
On the basis of the substrates identiﬁed and their presumed
mechanism of catalysis, these enzymes are referred to as
carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) (Auldridge et al.,
2006). The CCD family is ancient, with a large number of
family members present in bacteria, animals, and plants. In
Arabidopsis, the CCD enzyme family consists of nine
members, which are further divided into two subfamilies: ﬁve
9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and four
CCDs. The NCEDs are involved in the biosynthesis of the
plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) whereas CCDs are
involved in the cleavage of carotenoids in several sites to
generate multiple apocarotenoid products. CCDs are only
distantly related to the NCEDs, and their substrate speciﬁc-
ities and activities differ from those of the NCEDs (Ohmiya,
2009). Of the four CCD members in Arabidopsis, two CCD
enzymes, now known as CCD7 and CCD8, produce a type of
apocarotenoid that belongs to a novel class of plant
hormones involved in shoot branching, strigolactones,
(Gomez-Roldan et al.,2 0 0 8 ; Goulet and Klee, 2010; Rameau,
2010). The function(s) of the remaining two, CCD4 and
CCD1, appear to be related to speciﬁc carotenoids involved
with colour, ﬂavour, and aroma of fruits and ﬂowers of many
plant species (Ohmiya, 2009). In particular, plant CCD1s
cleave numerous cyclic and linear all-trans-carotenoids (C5–
C6, C7–C8, and C9–C10 double bonds) producing multiple
apocarotenoid products (Vogel et al.,2 0 0 8 ).
In this study, a cDNA coding for a new member of the
CCD family (BoCCD1)i nB. orellana was isolated. The
putative BoCCD1 open reading frame (ORF) sequence
differs from the CCD isolated in this plant (Bouvier et al.,
2003) and shares a high homology with other plant CCD1s
involved with the formation apocarotenoids. The mRNA
expression of this new CCD1 member, BoCCD1,i n
B. orellana was documented during several plant develop-
ment stages and during seed formation. The BoCCD1
expression pattern was correlated with carotenoid accumu-
lation in this plant (mainly bixin). In situ hybridization
methodology was used for the ﬁrst time in this plant to
investigate the expression of BoCCD1 and pigment
accumulation in different tissues of B. orellana.
Materials and methods
Plant material
Leaves, ﬂoral buds, open ﬂowers, immature fruits of 30 d post-
anthesis, and immature and mature seeds (from mature and
dehiscent fruit collected 60 d post-anthesis) were harvested from
B. orellana plants cultivated at a commercial plantation in
Chicxulub, Yucata ´n, Me ´xico. Additionally, immature fruits from
six different developmental stages were selected on the basis of the
width and height of their valves (1.531.5 cm, 232.5 cm,
2.532.5 cm, 3.534 cm, 4.535 cm, and 53 4.5 cm) and harvested
to obtain immature seeds of six different stages of maturity. All
tissues were obtained from a B. orellana variant with pink ﬂowers
and high pigment contents charaterized by Rivera-Madrid et al.
(2006). In addition, 30-day-old B. orellana plantlets were obtained
by germination of pre-treated seeds, as described by Narva ´ez et al.
(2001), and leaves, stalk, and roots were collected. Samples were
immediately frozen by immersion in liquid N2 and stored at
–80  C until analysis. For in situ RT-PCR analysis and pigment
localization, fresh tissues were cut into small pieces and immersed
in 5 vols of AMBION
  RNA Later solution (Applied Biosystems
Inc., CA, USA). The ﬁxed samples were kept at 4  C prior to
embedding and sectioning.
Assessment of carotenoid content
Total carotenoids were measured using spectrophotometric analy-
sis, by extracting pigments from 10 mg of freeze-dried tissues
ground with an electronic grinder, followed by adding 5 ml of ice-
cold chloroform in semi-darkness in an ice water bath.
Each mixture was shaken vigorously for 3 min and was ﬁltered
through a nylon membrane (0.45 lm pore size). Subsequently,
50 ll of each extract was adjusted to 3 ml with chloroform and
then measured with a DU 650 Beckman-Coulter spectrophotome-
ter. Absorption spectra were obtained at a wavelength range of
404–480 nm and carotenoid content was calculated using the
equation reported by Wellburn (1994).
For chromatographic [high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)] analysis of carotenoid and apocarotenoid compounds,
10 mg of freeze-dried tissues in chloroform were dried with
nitrogen gas to remove the solvent and then dissolved in 1 ml of
acetonitrile/methanol/isopropanol mixture (75:10:15 v/v/v). Sam-
ples were homogenized, centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min, and
the supernatants were ﬁltered through a PVDF membrane
(0.22 lm pore size). A 20 ll aliquot of the sample was injected
into a Hypersil ODS C-18 reverse phase column (250 mm34.6
mm; 5 lm bead diameter) and analytes were separated by HPLC.
The mobile phase consisted of solvent A [acetonitrile/methanol/
isopropanol (75:10:15 v/v/v)] and solvent B [tetrahydrofuran
(THF)], and chromatographic separation was performed at a ﬂow
rate of 1 ml min
 1 as follows: step 1, 100% solvent A at injection,
for 40 min; step 2, linear increase to 100% solvent B in 4 min; step
3, return to 100% solvent A in 5 min. Commercial standards from
Sigma, lycopene, b-carotene, ABA, and bixin were used. All
reagents used were HPLC grade and three replicates for each
sample were carried out for both extraction and HPLC analysis.
Individual carotenoids and apocarotenoids were identiﬁed based
on their column retention times, and their concentrations were
calculated from speciﬁc peak area relative to a standard curve
(Britton, 1995). Both HPLC and spectrophotometric data repre-
sented the mean of three replicates 6SE.
Bixin detection and distribution
For pigment distribution in plant tissues, fresh tissue samples were
ﬁxed with 4% neutral, buffered formalin and embedded in 5%
melted agarose. Agarose blocks were mounted in wooden holders
and sectioned transversely (30–40 lm slice thickness) with a micro-
tome (Microm GmbH, mod. HM340E, Lab Tech). The agarose
was eliminated from the tissue sections by rinsing with RNase-free
water. The sections were subsequently stained using the periodic
acid–Schiff (PAS) staining method. Fresh and stained sections
were observed with a light transmission microscope for general
morphology and pigment tissue localization. Photographs were
taken using an Axiocam digital camera coupled to a microscope,
and analysed by Axiovision-associated software.
Isolation of the BoCCD1 gene
Total RNA was obtained from immature seeds using the method
previously reported by Rodrı ´guez-A ´ vila et al. (2009), and the cDNA
population was obtained by a reverse transcriptase reaction.
5386 | Rodrı´guez-A ´ vila et al.BoCCD1 partial cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR with degenerate
primers (Fw1CCD, 5#-TGGTTYGAYGGNGAYGGNATG-3#;
and Rv1CCD, 5#-GTDATNGCRAARTCRTGCATCAT-3#). This
ampliﬁcation was performed by conventional PCR in 50 ll( 3 5
cycles of 94  C for 1 min, 56  C for 1.5 min, 72  Cf o r1 . 5m i n ,a n d
45 s extension at 72  C). For this ﬁrst primer set, conserved
sequences were identiﬁed by the alignment of several dioxygenases
reported for plant CCD orthologous genes. To obtain a full
BoCCD1 cDNA a 5#–3# RACE (rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA
ends) Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used. To isolate
the 3# and 5#ends, gene-speciﬁc primers Fw2CCD,
5#-TGGTTTTATGCACGATCCAGTGCCG-3#; and Rv2CCD,
5#-GGGTTTGTCACCCTCGTTAAGTGCCA-3# were designed
using the partial BoCCD1 cDNA (540 bp). This reaction was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitro-
gen). PCR products of 3# and 5# RACE were puriﬁed using the
Promega Wizard PCR Preps Puriﬁcation System (Promega, Madi-
son, WI, USA) and cloned using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The
cloned inserts were subsequently sequenced in an automated DNA
sequencer (ABI PRISM  3700), and on an ABI 373031 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by Macrogen Inc. (South Korea).
Resulting ORF sequences were compared with the GenBank protein
database using the Basic Local Alignment Sequence Tool (BLAST;
National Center for Biotechnology Information), and domain
homology was conﬁrmed with the CLUSTALW2 tool (http://
dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/multialign). Phylogenetic analysis was
performed with the MEGA 4.1 program (Tamura et al. 2007) using
the Neighbor–Joining (NJ) method. The reliability of the clusters
was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates.
Measurement of BoCCD1 expression level by reverse
transcriptase-mediated PCR
Total RNA was obtained using the method previously reported by
Rodrı ´guez-A ´ vila et al. (2009), and the cDNA was synthesized
using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for the
RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. After reverse transcription, the BoCCD1 transcript was
ampliﬁed by PCR with 30 cycles and with speciﬁc primers
(Fw:BoCCD1,5 #-ATGCAAGTCGAACCAACCAGGGGGATC-
3#; Rv:BoCCD1,5 #-TGCCTGGTTCAGCAGATCCTTGTC-3#),
designed from cloned BoCCD1 cDNA reported in this study
(EF493214). A parallel reaction with 25 cycles and speciﬁc primers
for the 18S rRNA gene (5’-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3’
and 5#-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3#, AF206868) was run as
an expression control for each PCR. Replicates of each PCR were
carried out to conﬁrm the results. BoCCD1 expression relative to
the 18S rRNA gene was assessed using a Bio-Image Analyzer
GS25 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Preliminary PCR products
were sequenced to verify their identity in all cases.
Assessment of BoCCD1 mRNA localization by in situ reverse
transcriptase-mediated PCR
Fresh samples ﬁxed as described above were rinsed three times for
10 min in a mixture of ethanol:acetic acid:water (63:5:32 v/v/v) and
once more with 13 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were
then embedded in 5% melted agarose (in 13 PBS). Sample blocks
were mounted in wooden holders and sliced in a microtome (Microm
GmbH Type HM 340E). Sections (30–40 lm thickness) were rinsed
with RNase-free water and incubated for 1 h with DNase (1 U ml
 1
at 37  C; Invitrogen). RT-PCRs were performed with a ‘One Step
RT/PCR reaction kit’ (Invitrogen) using 0.1 lM of speciﬁc BoCCD1
primers and 15 lM digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP. DIG-labelled PCR
products were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG
antibodies and alkaline phosphatase reaction with NBT/BCIP
(Roche, USA). As negative controls, DNase-treated sections were
incubated with RNase solution immediately before reverse transcrip-
tion. In addition, in situ RT-PCR analysis was performed with
b-actin-speciﬁc primers as positive controls. Digital images of the
samples were captured with a Leica DFC320 digital camera adapted
to the Leica MZFL III stereoscopic microscope and were processed
using Leica IM 50 software.
Results
Pigment content in organs of B. orellana plants
Pigment quantiﬁcation for different plantlet and adult
tissues of B. orellana showed a large amount of variation in
the accumulation of different carotenoids. Bixin was the
most abundant apocarotenoid observed in both immature
and mature seeds (Table 1). The concentrations of bixin
seem to change according to the developmental stage of the
seeds, continuously increasing during their development
until the seed reaches its maximum size (Table 1). Although
bixin has been widely reported in the mature seeds of
B. orellana (Rivera-Madrid et al., 2006), the presence of this
pigment in different tissues of B. orellana has not been
documented before. In this study, HPLC data indicated that
bixin was present in all of the tissues analysed, with the
highest amounts in immature and mature seeds. The lowest
quantities of bixin were registered in the plantlet root and
green fruit of adult plants (Table 1). Other carotenes, such
as b-carotene and lycopene, and the apocarotene ABA were
also measured in order to understand their relative roles in
bixin synthesis (Table 1). As expected, young and adult
plant leaves accumulated important amounts of b-carotene
(5–15 mg DW g
 1), since it is involved in the photosyn-
thetic apparatus. However, b-carotene was not detected in
other organs (Table 1). Lycopene, the precursor of several
carotenoids, was not detected in samples analysed in this
study, probably suggesting a rapid turnover of this com-
pound into the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. Finally,
ABA was abundant during seed development, with values
ranging from 0.4 mg DW g
 1 to 1.22 mg DW g
 1, and in
green tissues such as leaves and green fruits (Table 1).
Vegetative organs and ﬂowers accumulated high amounts of
carotenoids in their tissues (Table 1).
Pigment histological analysis
Both fresh and PAS/Alcian blue-stained preparations of
B. orellana tissues showed the presence of bixin in speciﬁc
cells. In the root apex (Fig. 1A), bixin was detected in
pericycle cells, which are located between the vascular pith
and endodermis. In addition, in plantlet roots, bixin was
mainly accumulated in the cortex (Fig. 1B–D). Oily droplets
of pigments, larger than starch grains accumulated in cells
of root tissues, were observed in the cytosol (Fig. 1C, D).
Higher accumulation of bixin was observed in plant stalks,
where it was only accumulated in collenchyma cells in the
stem cortex (Fig. 1E–H). In immature seeds, bixin was
detected in aril cells, observed as oily inclusions contained
in a thin cell layer covering the seed surface (Fig. 1I–L).
Pigment inclusions were distributed throughout the aril
layer (Fig. 1J), over a palisade-like cell layer covering the
A new carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene member from Bixa orellana | 5387endosperm tissue (Fig. 1K). It was observed that in mature
aril cells, bixin occupied the whole cell volume (Fig. 1J),
suggesting that mature aril cells are used for pigment
storage and lose their biosynthetic functions. Based on this,
mature seeds were not viable for further molecular studies.
Finally, stereoscopic observations of the leaf abaxial surface
showed speciﬁc bixin accumulation in cell patches uni-
formly distributed across each leaf (Fig. 1M, N). Histolog-
ical tissue samples of the plantlet leaves showed the
accumulation of bixin droplets in the spongy mesophyll
cells (Fig. 1O, P).
Bioinformatic analysis of the cloned BoCCD1 gene
The BoCCD1 cDNA sequence showed high identity with
CCD protein sequences available in GenBank (Fig. 2).
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the NJ method
(Fig. 2), showing a short distance of 0.01 with reference to
other plant CCD1 genes. The amino acid sequence also
reﬂected the presence of a conserved domain (RPE65),
which is characteristic of the enzymes involved in the
biosynthesis of apocarotenoids (Kloer and Schulz, 2006).
A graphic scheme showing the conformation and the sites
of the sequence isolated coding for the RPE65 domain
described is presented in Fig. 2. This bioinformatics analysis
shows at least three CCD members isolated in this plant
(BoCCD1, BoCCD,a n dBoLCD). In addition, a high
stringency Southern blot analysis was conducted to detect
the gene copy number likely to be encoding a CCD. In all
the experiments at least ﬁve fragments sharing homology
with BoCCD1 were detected, suggesting the presence of
a multigene family of CCDs in this plant (data not shown).
It is important to mention that the BoCCD1 isolated in this
study exhibits identity with another CCD (BoCCD) pre-
viously isolated in B. orellana (AJ549819).
Expression of the BoCCD1 gene in several plant organs
and developmental stages
BoCCD1 mRNA expression was evaluated in vegetative
organs (young and mature leaves, stems, and roots) and in
reproductive tissues (ﬂower bud, ﬂower, immature fruit, and
seeds in different developmental stages) by RT-PCR analysis
(Fig. 3). Adult and plantlet leaves, ﬂower buds, and immature
seeds exhibited a high expression of the BoCCD1 gene and, to
a lesser degree, in ﬂower, immature fruit, and mature seeds
(Fig. 3B, F). A more detailed analysis was carried out in
order to obtain information concerning how the BoCCD1
expression proﬁle could be related to bixin accumulation in
immature seeds. BoCCD1 expression increased throughout
seed maturation, reaching maximum levels at stage 6 of the
immature seeds (Fig. 3D). After seed maturation and
desiccation, BoCCD1 expression was weak (Fig. 3B). Plantlet
root and stalk showed a lower expression of this gene, while
in the leaves BoCCD1 mRNA was up-regulated (Fig. 3F).
BoCCD1 gene localization
An in situ RT-PCR assay was carried out in the tissues
where apocarotenoid production was observed, with the
aim of identifying the location of the BoCCD1 mRNA.
First the carotenoid content and distribution between
different tissues and cellular types were assessed. Seeds and
several other tissues with elevated amounts of apocarote-
noids were chosen to analyse the presence of this gene in
detail in several speciﬁc cells. In seeds, the BoCCD1 probe
was detected in the layer of oily cells located immediately

located in the aril layer adjacent to bixin deposits (Fig. 4F);
however, it was not detected in the endosperm of the seeds
(Fig. 4B). This suggests that the BoCCD1 gene could be
involved with apocarotenoid production, speciﬁcally bixin,
since its expression in these tissues coincided with the
highest pigment contents detected (Table 1).
Due to the fact that during the RT-PCR assay the
BoCCD1 transcripts were observed in the stalk of plantlets,
the tissue where pigment contents, speciﬁcally the apocar-
otenoid bixin, were highest (Table 1), an in situ RT-PCR
assay was carried out on stalk transversal sections. The
results obtained from the analysis derived from the PAS/
Alcian blue preparations showed bixin to be accumulated
speciﬁcally in the cells that make up the peridermis
(Fig. 5G). Similarly, the BoCCD1 signal was clearly
detected in cells corresponding to the xylem and surround-
ing the tubes of the phloem and in tissues where pigment
accumulation was detected, as well as in the cells of the
parenchyma and peridermis in the leaves (Fig. 5A, B).
Discussion
A plethora of apocarotenoid compounds have been
reported in the seeds of B. orellana, including methyl (9#Z)-
apo-6#-lycopenoate, methyl (9Z)-6#-oxo-6,6#-diapocarote-
noate, and methyl (all-E)-8#-apo-b-caroten-8#-oate, with
bixin being the most abundant (Mercadante et al., 1997;
Bittencourt et al., 2005)( Fig. 6). So far, only one study has
investigated an expression response of carotene-related
genes during development in B. orellana (Rodrı ´guez-Avila
et al., 2011). In that study, expression responses of dxs, psy,
pds, b-lcy, and e-lcy genes were associated with pigment
overaccumulation in two different annatto cultivars. How-
ever, in vivo apocarotenoid-related gene analysis and
apocarotenoid production during plant development have
not been conducted in this plant.
The results obtained in the present study showed that bixin
production is not restricted to seed tissues since this pigment
was detected in all the tissues analysed, particularly in the
cells surrounding the vascular tissues and in the epidermal

plant tissues analysed, and accumulated in greater amounts
in ﬂoral buds and immature fruits in accordance with its
role in development regulation and fruit maturation
(Chernys and Zeevaart, 2000; Rodrigo et al., 2006). Other
pigments related to carotene precursors of bixin such as
lycopene (Bouvier et al., 2003) were undetected in all tissues
analysed, suggesting a rapid turnover of this molecule
during pigment biosynthesis. Finally, b-carotene was
detected only in green tissues, in accordance with its role in
photosynthesis (Grotewold, 2006).
CCDs are enzymes involved in the production of
apocarotenoids such as bixin. Two CCD genes have pre-
viously been isolated for B. orellana; however, only one of
these (BoLCD) has been proved to be responsible for bixin

A new carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene member from Bixa orellana | 5391production and its role has been shown in a heterologous
system (Bouvier et al., 2003). Here, a new CCD gene,
BoCCD1, was isolated (EF493214) and its sequence showed
high homology with other plant CCD1s. Furthermore, the
highly conserved RPE65 domain, which is responsible for
the catalytic activity of the CCDs, was found to be encoded
in this sequence (Kloer and Schulz, 2006)( Fig. 2).
Phylogenetic analysis conducted with the sequences of the
previously isolated CCD genes for B. orellana (AJ489277
and AJ549819), and for other plants, showed that BoCCD1
shares the same ancestor gene as another CCD isolated for
B. orellana (the CCD gene, AJ549819). However, BoLCD
(AJ489277), the gene involved in bixin biosynthesis
(Bouvier et al., 2003), is located in a distant clade (CCD4
clade), suggesting a different gene ancestor.
BoCCD1 has the same phylogenetic origin as the CCD1
genes isolated from Coffea canephora (CcCCD1) or Petunia
hybrida (PhCCD1), these enzymes catalysing the symmetrical
9,10 (9’,10’) cleavage of multiple linear and cyclized carote-
noids (Simkin et al.,2 0 0 4 , 2008). This cleavage results in the
formation of a diverse variety of C13 cyclohexone apocar-
otenoids and a C14 dialdehyde, corresponding to the central
portion of the original carotenoid (Simkin et al.,2 0 0 4 ). In
addition, CCD1 cleavage activity on 5,6 (5’,6’) double bonds
in vitro has also been reported (Vogel et al.,2 0 0 8 ).
In accordance with the above, molecular studies were
performed to analyse the role of this new CCD1 isolated
from B. orellana in carotenoid production. In this sense, the
primary expression proﬁles were obtained for different
B. orellana tissues which have been analysed and character-
ized in previous studies (Rivera-Madrid et al.,2 0 0 6 ).
BoCCD1 mRNA was present in all of the plantlet tissues
analysed (leaves, stalk, and roots), being up-regulated again
in the leaves of the plantlets analysed. It was possible to
relate BoCCD1 expression to total carotenoid accumulation.
Expression analyses carried out on the CCD1 genes of
several plant species have shown that individual genes have
a tissue-speciﬁc expression proﬁle, which is controlled in
accordance with the production of apocarotenoids such as
those involved in development or stress response (Prescott
and John, 1996; Simkin et al.,2 0 0 4 , 2008). Here, BoCCD1
expression was high in immature seeds, although the peak in
total carotenoids and bixin was observed in mature seeds.
These results could mean that BoCCD1 expression is induced
when pigment production begins and is down-regulated
when its biosynthesis is accomplished. Consequently, a study
was designed to observe the role of the BoCCD1 gene during
the accumulation of total carotenoids in seeds. Immature
seeds corresponding to six different developmental stages
were selected to analyse the expression proﬁle of BoCCD1 by
RT-PCR. Interestingly, BoCCD1 mRNA showed a coordi-
nated increase in its expression with the accumulation of
carotenoids, particularly bixin, observed in the different
developmental stages of the seeds. Similarly, the expression
of CCD1s in several plant species is controlled in accor-
dance with the production of important apocarotenoids
such as b-ionone, a fragrance volatile in petunia ﬂowers, or
C13-norisoprenoids, considered ﬂavour compounds in grape
berries (Simkin et al., 2004; Mathieu et al., 2005).
The results obtained from the histological analysis
revealed that the pigment granules (mainly bixin) accumu-
lated in the surface of the seeds, settling in a layer of oily
cells which cover the aril. In addition, the in situ RT-PCR
assay showed that the BoCCD1 transcripts were also
located in this oily layer, suggesting a relationship between
this gene and the accumulation of apocarotenoids. A new in
situ RT-PCR assay was carried out speciﬁcally on the aril
layer of the seed. The strong signal of the BoCCD1 gene
obtained in this seed tissue indicated that BoCCD1 mRNA
location is concordant with the production of total carote-
noids and speciﬁc apocarotenoids such as bixin. The
importance of this gene in carotenoid turnover during seed
maturation has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis by the

appearance but higher levels of mature seed carotenoids
(Auldridge et al., 2006).
In the in situ RT-PCR assay carried out on the stalk,
BoCCD1 expression was located in the cells surrounding the
xylem and phloem tissues. Results derived from the
histological analysis showed that in the stalk, pigments
(mainly bixin) are accumulated speciﬁcally in the cells that
make up the peridermis. Both results suggest that pigment
apocarotenoids are probably synthesized in the vascular
tissues and later exported to the epidermal cells; accord-
ingly, the translocation of bixin from the stalk and leaves
Fig. 6. Hypothetical biosynthesis pathway of linear apocarotenoids reported for Bixa orellana. The possible cleavage sites and CCDs
involved were determined based on the substrates and cleavage sites of type 1 CCDs (such as the one isolated in this study) and type 4
(BoLCD; Bouvier et al., 2003), the regioselectivity of which has been well charaterized in this and in other plants. The question marks
relate to possible precursors and routes of biosynthesis inferred on the basis of the chemical structure observed. The small dotted lines
indicate the possible cleavage sites of the CCDs, whose hypothetical function is indicated.
A new carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene member from Bixa orellana | 5393into seeds could also be possible. Some important apocar-
otenoids, such as the plant hormone ABA, act in tissues
different from where they were synthesized (Tan et al.,
2003). Thus, the expression of the BoCCD1 gene is
probably related to the high apocarotenoid diversity
registered in different tissues of this plant and may be
related to the accumulation of some speciﬁc apocarotenoids
present in seeds not analysed here [i.e. methyl (all-E)-8#-
apo-b-caroten-8#-oate] (Mercadante et al., 1996, 1997;
Bittencourt et al., 2005).
The cleavage sites of CCD1 suggest its possible in-
volvement in the synthesis of several apocarotenoids of
B. orellana (Walter and Strack, 2011)( Fig. 6). It has been
discovered that in rice, maize, and tomato plants, CCD1s
also act on the C5–C6/C5#–C6# double bonds of acyclic
carotenoids, resulting in the volatile C8 ketone 6-methyl-5-
hepten-2-one. By means of in vivo and in vitro assays, they
have shown that rice CCD1 converts lycopene into three
different volatiles: 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, pseudoionone,
and geranial (C10). Furthermore, comparison of the relative
amounts of the C19 and C17 aldehydes accumulated in the
incubations with the natural substrates lycopene and 3-OH-
c-carotene indicated that the preference of OsCCD1 for the
C5’–C6’ and C7’–C8’ double bonds depends on the nature
of the substrate (Ilg et al., 2009). In the present study, the
carotenoid lycopene was absent in all tissues analysed,
which strongly suggests the rapid metabolism of these
molecules to produce their derivatives.
Finally, based on the current knowledge of the cleavage
sites and substrates of this type of enzyme (Rubio et al.,
2008; Ilg et al., 2009; Walter and Strack, 2011), it is
considered that this BoCCD1 enzyme is possible related to
the cleavage of lycopene at the double bonds 5–6/5#–6#
leading to the formation of the second precursor of bixin
(Fig. 6). However, biochemical analyses remain to be
carried out on the protein product of this gene in order to
clarify this. The above idea is in agreement with the
presence of transcripts of this gene (in almost all tissues) in
relation to the accumulation of bixin, mainly in seed
maturation developmental stages. Although a previous
CCD4 (BoLCD) has been reported during bixin formation
(Bouvier et al., 2003), the other CCD members, particularly
CCD1, could be involved in the synergic production of
bixin and other important apocarotenoids derived from its
putative CCD1 activity. As previously reported in Crocus
sativus, four CCDs were isolated, two CCD1s and two
CCD4s, and all of them were able to cleave b-carotene at
the 9, 10 (9#,1 0 #) positions to yield b-ionone. It seems to be
common in secondary metabolism for gene families with the
same enzymatic activity to be present (Rubio et al., 2008).
The data of Rubio et al. (2008) strongly suggest that each
class of enzymes could be responsible for the metabolism of
carotenoids at speciﬁc and different subcellular sites, during
normal development and in response to conditions of stress.
Thus in B. orellana, taking into account that BoLCD
(Bouvier et al., 2003) seems to be a putative CCD4 protein
located in plastids, and BoCCD1 seems to be cytosolic,
both could, in a coordinated or alternating manner, pro-
duce several apocarotenoids in B. orellana including bixin,
as in the case of C. sativus for the production of other
apocarotenoids (Rubio et al., 2008). Although the bio-
synthetic pathway of bixin was revealed several years ago
(Bouvier et al.,2 0 0 3 ), the predicted 5–6/5’–6’ cleavage
speciﬁcity of the putative BoLCD has not yet been clariﬁed
(Sergeant et al., 2009; Walter and Strack, 2011). However,
for these hypotheses, additional research needs to be
conducted in planta to obtain further direct evidence that
BoCCD1 is involved in bixin biosynthesis and apocarote-
noid diversiﬁcation in B. orellana.
