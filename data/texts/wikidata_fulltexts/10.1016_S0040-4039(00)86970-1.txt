Summary : Karinolide 1 is  a s t ruc tura l ly  novel C20 quassinoid isolated from the French Guyanan 
Simaroubaceae, Simaba muZtifZora A.Juss. whose s t ruc ture  was established by !-ray d i  Ffraction 
analysis.  6a-Senecioyloxychaparrin 3, the known 6a-senecioy~oxychaparrinone 2 and 9-methoxy- 
canthin-6-one 5 were also isolated ; t h e i r  s t ruc tures  were determined by spectral  means. 
The Simaroubaceae Simaba mtiZtifZora A.Juss. i s  a t a l l  tree which grows to heights of 
15 t o  20 m and i s  widely dis t r ibuted i n  South America. I t  has often been described, although 
erroneously, as being synoniymous w i t h  .%naba guanensis Aubl. from which i t  d i f f e r s  by several 
morphological features ,  especial ly  the s i z e .  
of S.muZtifZora originat ing from Peru resul ted i n  
the i so la t ion  o f  Ga-senecioyloxychaparrinone 2, act ive i n  both murine lymphocytic leukemia 
(P-388) and so l id  tumor systems. Our continuing work on the Simaroubaceae led us t o  explore 
the French Guyanan Simaba muZtifZora '. We herein report the i so la t ion  and s t ructural  e luci-  
dation of a novel quassinoid, named Karinolide 1. 6a-Senecioyloxychaparrin 3 along w i t h  the 
known Pdehydro compound 1, was also isolated as well as the previously described 
canthin-&one 2.

The molecular formula of Karinolide 1, m.p. 208-210°C, was established by i t s  h i g h  
resolution mass spectrum as C20H2408 (M" a t  m/z 392.1472). The U . V .  spectrum showed maxima 
a t  227 ( E  4260) and 295 nm ( E  10020) indicating the presence of a dienone chromophore. The 
1 250 MHz H-n.m.r. spectrum of I. ( i n  C D C 1 3  t 5 % pyridine-d5) w i t h  decoupling experiments 
revealed a cer ta in  amount of s t ructural  information. I t  displayed s ignals  for  a secondary 
methyl a t  6 1.15 ( d ,  J = 7Hz, Me-13) and an angular methyl group a t  6 1.38, and a downfield 
resonance a t  1.96 ppm assigned t o  Me-4. I t  a lso revealed : an AB pattern (6 3.75 and 3.62 ; 
J = 9Hzl assignable t o  the hydroxymethyi group a t  C-8, signals  a t  3.48 ( s ,  H-9), 3.65 (b r . s ,

respectively which are  mutually long range coupled

as  observed. The s t ructure  was solved by d i r ec t  methods using the Riche's phase function and 
the negative quartet  t e s t  (Multan qave t r i v i a l  Patterson-like solut ions and thus fa i led  t o

atoms were n o t  refined b u t  positionned a t  t he i r  theoret ical  places).

yellow needles, m.p. 178-180". I t s  molecular formula was established by high resolution mass 
spectrometry as C15H10N202 ( M t *  a t  m/z 250.0735). The U . V .  spectrum showed maxima a t  272 
(E  14750), 310 (E  4500) and 353 nm [E 7000) , and the i . r .  spectrum (CHC13) displayed absorp- 
t ions a t  1680, 1635 and 1610 an-'. These properties indicated t h a t  5 belonged t o  the canthin- 
6-ones, the alcaloids  charac te r i s t ic  of the Simaroubaceae lo. The 250 MHz H-n.m.r. spectrum 
revealed the presence of a methoxy group ( 6  3.99 ppm,) and decoupling experiments allowed 
the unambiguous assignment of a l  1 o le f in ic  and aromatic protons. The spectrum (Fig. 2) 
the presence of two isolated pairs  of vicinal protons ( 6  7.85 and 8.77 ppm, 2 d ,  J = 5 Hz, 
H - 1  and H-2 ; 6 8.02 and 6.96 ppm, 2d ,  J = 10 Hz, H-4 and H-5). The methoxy group must be 
located a t  C-9, since the downfield signal a t  6 8.22, assigned t o  H-8, showed only m n -  
coupling w i t h  H-10 ( 6  7.08, J = 2.5 Hz) which i s  i n  turn ortho-coupled w i t h  H-11 ( 6  7.96, 
J = 9 Hz). Canthin-6-one 5 has recently been isolated by Giesbrecht e t  a l .  from the Brazil ian 
Simaroubaceae, Simaba etispidata .
