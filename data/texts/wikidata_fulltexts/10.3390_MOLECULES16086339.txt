Abstract: A novel furocoumarin derivative named oxyalloimperatorin (1), together with 
seventeen furocoumarins 2–18 were isolated from the radix of Angelica dahurica. The 
chemical structure of new metabolite was characterized by analysis of IR, NMR, and HR-
ESI-MS spectroscopic data. Among the isolated compounds, 13, 16, and 18 (each at 20 
μM) could significantly promote the gene transcriptional function of nuclear receptor 
RXRα. While 7–9, 13, 14, and the new structure 1 (each at 20 μM) showed significant 
reduction in RXRα gene transcriptional activities induced by 9-cis-retinoid acid. The 
findings indicated that these furocoumarin skeleton derivatives might hold beneficial 
effects on many intractable diseases, such as cancer and metabolic diseases, due to their 
potential activities on regulating the transcriptional activation function of RXRα.

1. Introduction  
Radix Angelicae Dahuricae, the root of Angelica dahurica (Fisch. ex Hoffm) Benth, et Hook. f. 
var.formosana (Boiss.) Shan et Yuan, has been widely used as a traditional medicine in China for  
the treatment of toothache, headache, cough, asthma, coryza, etc. [1]. Previous phytochemical 
investigation revealed that the root of A. dahurica possesses various chemical composition including 
volatile oil, coumarins and glycosides. In them, coumarins were the most important major components 
with many remarkable activities, such as anti-inflammation [2], anti-bacteria [3], and lipogenetic 
inhibition [4]. In addition, many studies have been concerned about the anticancer effect of coumarins 
from A. dahurica [5-8].  
The retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-
activated transcription factors and an obligatory heterodimer partner for many nuclear receptors such 
as the peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor (PPAR), the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and the liver 
X receptor (LXR) [9]. It plays key roles in various biological processes including cancer, diabetes, 
obesity, and atherosclerosis, and both agonist and antagonist of RXRα have been revealed to exert 
beneficial effects in such diseases [10-12]. In recent years, more and more studies have been focused 
on screening small molecules with regulatory function to RXRα from nature [13-15]. The specific aim 
of our present study was to identify novel naturally occurring metabolites with regulatory effects on 
RXRα gene transcriptional activation. Several furocoumarins were isolated from the radix of A. 
dahuricae and their transcriptional activities were examined by reporter gene assay. 
2. Results and Discussion 
Chromatography of the EtOAc-soluble extract of the Radix Angelicae Dahuricae produced a novel 
furocoumarin derivative 1, together with seventeen furocoumarins 2-18. The known compounds were 
identified as isoimperatorin (2) [16], cnidilin (3) [17], phellopterin (4) [18], bergapten (5) [18], 
imperatorin (6) [19], xanthotoxin (7) [5], alloimperatorin (8) [16], isooxypeucedanin (9) [20], 
isodemethylfuropinarine (10) [21], xanthotoxol (11) [16], 5-methoxy-8-hydroxypsoralen (12) [22], 
demethylfuropinarine (13) [23], apaensin (14) [24], pabulenol (15) [25], isobyakangelicin (16) [26], 
byakangelicol (17) [18] and oxypeucedanin hydrate (18) [17], respectively. Among them, 10 and 13 
were isolated from A. dahurica for the first time. 
Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder, [α]22D +5 (c 0.4, MeOH). Its molecular 
formula, C17H16O5, was established by HR-ESI-MS with a mass of [M + Na]+ (m/z 323.0894, calcd. 
323.0890). The IR spectrum of 1 showed characteristic absorptions of α,β-unsaturated lactone (νmax 
1738 cm–1), and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (νmax 1687 cm–1) groups. The 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 
showed two methyl, one methoxyl, five olefinic, and one methylene proton. The 13C-NMR, and DEPT 
spectra of 1 displayed 18 carbons, including two methyls, one methoxyl, five olefinic methines, two 
ketone carbonyl, and five quarternary carbons (Table 1). Proton signals were all allocated by 
observation of HMQC correlations from δH 6.69 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz) to δC 120.2, δH 7.90 (1H, d,  
J = 9.6 Hz) to δC 140.7, δH 8.09 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz) to δC 149.6, δH 6.92 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz) to δC 110.0, 
δH 2.84 (2H, br d, J = 7.6 Hz) to δC 39.1, δH 4.78 (1H, tq, J = 7.6, 1.2 Hz) to δC 115.9, δH 1.53 (3H, d,  
J = 1.2 Hz) to δC 24.7, δH 1.42 (3H, d, J = 1.2 Hz) to δC 17.1, and δH 3.03 (3H, s) to δC 51.8. The above

1H- and 13C-NMR data were partly similar to those of alloimperatorin (8), which is a furocoumarin 
conjugated a prenyl unit [16]. Firstly, the proton signal of olefinic methine at δH 4.78 (tq, J = 7.6,  
1.2 Hz) showed the same couple constants as two methyl protons (δH 1.53, d, J = 1.2 Hz and 1.42, d,  
J = 1.2 Hz) and methylene protons at δH 2.84 (br d, J = 7.6 Hz). HMBC spectra showed correlations 
from the olefinic triplet (δH 4.78) to the methyl resonances δC 24.7, from the methylene proton (δH 
2.84) to δC 115.9 and 136.3, from the two methyl proton resonances (δH 1.53 and 1.42) to δC 115.9 and 
136.3. The above data together with the 1H-1H COSY correlations between δH 4.78 and the methylene 
proton at δH 2.84 indicated the presence of a prenyl unit in 1. Secondly, a pyrone ring residue of 
coumarin including resonances of δC 158.7, 120.2, 140.7, 150.9, 126.6 and δH 6.69, 7.90 could be 
identified by combining analysis of 1H-, 13C-NMR and HMBC spectra. In which, two coupling proton 
signals at δH 6.69 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz, H-3) and δH 7.90 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz, H-4) assigned to the double 
bond protons of pyrone ring presented HMBC correlations with δC 158.7 (C-2), 150.9 (C-9), and 126.6 
(C-10). In addition, HMBC correlations from δH 8.09 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz) and 6.92 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz) 
to δC 138.4 and 147.3 suggested the presence of a furan ring which included resonances of δH 8.09  
(H-2′), 6.92 (H-3′), δC 149.6 (C-2′), 110.0 (C-3′), 138.4 (C-6), and 147.3 (C-7). Interestingly, the 
methylene proton (δH 2.84) of prenyl was largely upfield shifted comparing with that of 8, with 
chemical shift at δH 3.72 (2H, d, J = 7.2 Hz), indicating that the prenyl was no longer attached to an 
unsaturated carbon of the furocoumarin moiety. The observation of HMBC correlations from δH 2.84 
to carbon signals at δC 76.4, 126.6, and 138.4 illustrated that the prenyl located at the quaternary 
carbon at δC 76.4 which was adjacent to the pyrone and furan ring. In addition, the resonance δC 164.7 
at downfield shift in 13C-NMR spectrum could be assigned as a conjugated ketone carbon according 
with the presence of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl stretching vibration (νmax 1687 cm–1) in IR spectrum. 
Long-rang HMBC correlations from H-4 (δH 7.90) to δC 164.7 suggested the adjacency relation 
between the pyrone ring and the ketone carbon. The location of the methoxyl substituent was 
confirmed by observing the long-range correlation from methoxyl proton signal at δH3.03 (3H, s) to the 
quaternary carbon at δC 76.4. Thus, the chemical structure of 1 was finally elucidated as illustrated in 
Figure 1, and was named oxyalloimperatorin. The stereochemistry of C-5 remains to be determined.

All isolated compounds were furocoumarin skeleton derivatives. Their effects on gene transactivity 
of RXRα were evaluated by a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. It is well known that 9-cis-
retinoid acid (9-cis-RA) could largely promote the reporter transcription [27]. As shown in Figure 2, 
consistent with previous results, treatment of cells with 9-cis-RA (0.1 μM) significantly (P < 0.01) 
induced the reporter transcription with a relative luciferase activity of 79%.

Transfected 293T cells were treated with compounds (20 μM) or 9-cis-retinoid acid (RA) (0.1 μM) 
for 12 h. The activities of Firefly luciferase and Rellina luciferase were measured. Relative 
Luciferase Activities were calculated as the ratio between activities of Firefly luciferase and Rellina 
luciferase. RA was used as a positive control. Data were presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05; 
**p < 0.01 compared with vehicle treated control group. #p < 0.01 compared with RA group.

Among the isolated compounds, 18 (20 μM) significantly (P < 0.01) increased the transcriptional 
activation of RXRα, while 13 and 16 (each at 20 μM) showed weak effects (P < 0.05) on increasing the 
reporter transcription (Figure 2). Furthermore, 18 with concentration-dependent effect in the range of  
10~40 μM is shown in Figure 3.

All the isolated compounds were also examined for their possibility to inhibit the transactivity of 
RXRα using a similar assay as previous report, in which 9-cis-RA was simultaneously added to 
strongly induce RXRα gene transactivity [14]. Among tested compounds, 7–9, 13, 14, and the new 
structure 1 (each at 20 μM) showed significant reduction in the relative luciferase activity induced by 
9-cis-RA (Figure 4). In addition, 1, 9 and 14 were further measured in three different concentrations at 
10, 20 and 40 μM. As shown in Figure 5, all three metabolites exhibited good concentration-dependent 
inhibitory effects.  
The above findings indicate that these furocoumarin skeleton derivatives might have useful impact 
on many intractable diseases, such as cancer and metabolic diseases, due to their potential effects on 
regulating the transcriptional activation function of RXRα. Interestingly, compound 13 showed not 
only weakly increased the reporter transcriptional activation of RXRα but it also reduced the 
transactivity of RXRα induced by 9-cis-RA. One of the possible reasons could be that 13 and 9-cis-RA 
bind competitively with RXRα when they were simultaneously added to cells. Because of the 
transactive effect of 13 was rather weaker than that of 9-cis-RA (Figure 2), the transactivity of RXRα 
induced by 9-cis-RA was therefore decreased. However, this speculation and whether all the candidate 
compounds could bind to RXRα to regulate its transcriptional expression or not needs to be confirmed 
by further study.

3.2. Materials  
Radix Angelicae Dahuricae, the dry root of A. dahurica (Fisch. ex Hoffm) Benth, et Hook. f, was 
purchased from a store of Tongrentang Pharmacy (Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China) and 
identified by Mrs. Xiuhong Zhou (Senior Engineer, Forestry Bureau of Yongchun, Quanzhou City, 
China). A voucher specimen was deposited at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Xiamen 
University, Xiamen, China. Plasmids (pBind RXRα LBD and pG5 luc) were provided by Dr. Xiao-kun 
Zhang from the Burnham Institute for Medical Research, Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA. Dual-

3.3. Extraction and Isolation 
The dried root of A. dahurica (3 kg) was boiled and refluxed for 2 h with 60% of aqueous ethanol 
solution (5 L × 3 times). After filtration, the extracted solution was concentrated in vacuo. The 
condensate was then suspended in H2O (5 L) and partitioned with EtOAc (5 L × 3 times). The EtOAc 
extracts were combined and evaporated under vacuum to afford an EtOAc-soluble extract (48.3 g). 
The EtOAc-soluble extract (45.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column using stepwise gradient

with aqueous methanol solution (40~100%) to produce 8 (58.0 mg) and a subfraction (Fr.2-9-2) which 
was further purified through preparative HPLC eluting with MeOH-H2O (60:40) to afford 9 (39.0 mg, 
Rt 6.5 min) and 10 (23.0 mg, Rt 10.5 min). Fr.2-10 (883.0 mg) was subjected to YMC gel column and 
eluted with aqueous methanol solution (40~100%) to get 11 (44.0 mg), 12 (21.0 mg), 1 (12.0 mg), and 
subfraction Fr.2-10-4 (100 mg) was chromatographed on YMC gel to get 13 (14.0 mg) and Fr.2-10-4-1 
which was further purified through preparative HPLC eluting with MeOH-H2O (70:30) to afford 14

chromatography with aqueous methanol solution (40~100%) as elution to afford 16 (256.0 mg). Fr.5 
(2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel column eluted with EtOAc-MeOH (96:4~0:100) to afford Fr.5-7 
(155 mg) which was crystallized in chloroform to obtain 17 (50.0 mg). Fr.7 (5.18 g) was subjected to 
silica gel column chromatography eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (99:1~0:100) to afford Fr.7-3. The

3.4. Cell Culture and Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay 
Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS). The previous dual-luciferase reporter gene assay with some modification was used in the 
present study [14,27]. In brief, approximately 4 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells 
were transfected with two plasmids, 30 ng pBind RXRα LBD and 60 ng pG5 luc using Lipofectamine 
2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were exposed to tested compounds for 12 h. Then, the cells were 
washed with PBS and lysed with passive lysis buffer (1 × PLB) on rocking platform for 15 min. The 
activities of Firefly luciferase and Rellina luciferase were examined according to the introduction of 
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System Kit. Relative luciferase activities were obtained as the ratio 
between activities of Firefly luciferase and Rellina luciferase. 
 
3.5. Statistical Analysis 
The results were expressed as mean ± standard diviation (S.D.) from at least three independent 
experiments. Statistical significances were compared between two groups. Statistical analysis was 
performed with the Student’s t-test. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
4. Conclusions 
One novel furocoumarin derivative 1, together with seventeen furocoumarins 2–18 were isolated 
from the radix of Angelica dahurica. The chemical structure of new metabolite was characterized by 
analysis of IR, NMR, and HR-ESI-MS spectroscopic data. Among these furocoumarin skeleton 
derivatives, the new compound 1, and known compounds 7–9, 13, 14, 16 and 18 showed the potential 
activities in regulating transcriptional activation function of RXRα. These metabolites might show 
beneficial effects against intractable diseases with relation to RXRα, for example anti-cancer and anti-
diabetes. The various bioactivities of these metabolites and their molecular mechanism of action 
relating to nuclear receptor RXRα could be examined in the future study.
