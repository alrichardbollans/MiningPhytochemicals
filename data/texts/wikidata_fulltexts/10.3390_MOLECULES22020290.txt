Observations on their use andefficacy significantly contribute to the disclosure of their therapeutic properties. Calamintha nepeta (L.)Savi is an aromatic herb with a mint-oregano flavor, used in the Mediterranean areas as a traditionalmedicine. It has an extensive range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidantand anti-inflammatory, as well as anti-ulcer and insecticidal properties. This study aims to reviewthe scientific findings and research reported to date on Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi that prove manyof the remarkable various biological actions, effects and some uses of this species as a source ofbioactive natural compounds. On the other hand, pulegone, the major chemical constituent ofCalamintha nepeta (L.) Savi essential oil, has been reported to exhibit numerous bioactivities in cellsand animals. Thus, this integrated overview also surveys and interprets the present knowledgeof chemistry and analysis of this oxygenated monoterpene, as well as its beneficial bioactivities.Areas for future research are suggested.Keywords: Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi; essential oil; extract; pulegone; biological activity1. IntroductionEssential oils (EOs) are aromatic oily liquids obtained from plant material (flowers, buds, seeds,leaves, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and roots). They are usually complex mixtures of natural compounds,both polar and nonpolar [1], composed principally of terpenoids and their oxygenated derivatives.A variety of other molecules, such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, acids, alcohols, aldehydes, acyclicesters or lactones, and exceptionally nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, coumarins andphenylpropanoid homologues, may also occur. Nowadays, EOs have received much attention aspotentially useful bioactive compounds with particular emphasis on their antimicrobial, cytostaticand insecticidal activities. They have been widely used as food flavors [2], and possessing antioxidantand antimicrobial activities serve as natural additives in foods and food products [3]. Known for theirantiseptic (i.e., bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal), medicinal properties and their fragrance, they areused in embalmment, preservation of foods and as antimicrobial, analgesic, sedative, anti-inflammatory,spasmolytic and local anesthetic remedies [4].Medicinal plants represent the basis of health care throughout the World since the earliest daysof humanity and are still widely used [5]. Despite the fact that many of them have been replacedby synthetic drugs, the demand for natural products is continously increasing. Traditional use ofmedicinal plants encourages new phytochemical and biological screening activity, through whichMolecules 2017, 22, 290; doi:10.3390/molecules22020290 www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2017, 22, 290 2 of 50positive and safe therapeutic results may to be achieved. The World Health Organization (WHO)has noted that a majority of the World’s population depends on traditional medicine for its primaryhealthcare [6]. Many EOs and their ingredients have been shown to exhibit a range of biologicalactivities, including antibacterial and antifungal ones. Antimicrobial properties of EOs are continuouslyinvestigated both in vitro [7,8] and in vivo [9,10] against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.Their preparations find applications as naturally occurring antimicrobial agents in pharmacology,pharmaceutical botany, phytopathology, medical and clinical microbiology and food preservation.This review focuses on the EO of Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi (CN) and one of its main chemicalconstituents—pulegone (PUL).2. Calamintha: Species, Taxonomy, Occurrence and UsesThe genus Calamintha Mill. (calamint in English) includes aromatic plants belonging to theLamiaceae family, which is well represented and widespread all around the Mediterranean region.Numerous members of this family are used as spices, and are also employed in folk medicine in diversetraditions. Calamintha species are medium to large size erect herbaceous perennials, sometimes woodyat the base, represented by eight species [11] distributed in Europe, Eastern Mediterranean region,Central Asia, North Africa and America [12,13]. The number was as high as 30 before revisions intaxonomy, leaving a lot of synonyms in other Lamiaceae genera such as Acinos Miller, Clinopodium L.,Micromeria Bentham and Satureja L. For this reason, the use of chemotaxonomic markers is essential tobetter differentiation of these genera [14].The genus is represented by five polymorphic species in the European flora: CN, C. grandiflora (L.)Moench, C. sylvatica Bromf., C. incana (Sibth. & Sm.) Boiss and C. cretica (L.) Lam. [15], the last one beingan endemic Cretan (Greece) species. However, according to other authors [12,13] only in Turkey thereare nine species and four subspecies, with six endemic taxa, while six extremely polymorphic speciesare reported for the Balkan Peninsula area [16,17]. The official Italian flora [18] has recognized onlythree species, and C. sandaliotica Bacchetta & Brullo from Sardinia (Italy) has been recently described asa species new to science, morphologically related to CN [19].Because of their pleasant mint-like smell, many Calamintha species are used as spices in variousculinary recipes. They are used in folk medicine like mints, mainly as stimulant, digestive, tonic,antiseptic etc. [20]. These plants are used as antispasmodic, emmenagogue, diaphoretic, diuretics,carminatives expectorant and for strengthening central nervous system [13,21–25]. The tea is usedto help with gas and colic, and externally, it is useful in poultices for bruises [20,23]. Investigationsshowed that leaves and flowers of Calamintha species are effective as an antiseptic, antispasmodic andtonic [11,17,26], as well as antimicrobial and antispasmodic activities of their EOs [11,27,28]. The oilsof some species exert significant sedating and antipyretic activities in rats, likely due to the presenceof the monoterpenes pulegone, menthone and eucalyptol [23,29]. Calamintha EOs are also used forstomach and throat aches and kidney disorders [12,13,17,30]. Calamintha species also have horticulturaluses [21].3. Calamintha Essential OilsEOs are extracted from various aromatic plants, generally localized in temperate to warm areaslike Mediterranean and tropical countries, where they represent an important part of the traditionalpharmacopeia [4]. Recently, they have sparked interests as sources of natural products, and have beenscreened for their potential uses as alternative remedies for the treatment of many infectious diseasesand the preservation food from either toxic effects of oxidants or from bacteria and fungi. Researchon plants from different regions has led to innovative EOs uses [31]. Particularly, the antimicrobialactivities of plant oils and extracts have formed the basis of many applications, including raw andprocessed food preservation, pharmaceuticals, alternative medicine and natural therapies [32].The Lamiaceae family consists of approximately 200 genera of cosmopolitan distribution, manyof them of economic importance due to EO production. Different Calamintha species vary in theirMolecules 2017, 22, 290 3 of 50EO content and composition. Moreover, the genus is characterized by highly complex chemicalpolymorphism, but the compounds of monoterpenoids are found to prevail, especially the oxygenatedp-menthane-type monoterpenoids. The content of sesquiterpenoids is up to 5% [17,33].Generally, three main chemotypes can be distinguished: PUL, piperitone oxide and carvone [34,35].The well-known influence of origin, as well as different environmental conditions (temperature,photoperiod, nutrition and salinity) on the nature of plant chemical composition, make this complexitywithin the genus quite expected. The effect of different distillation methods on oil content andcomposition has been previously reported [36–38]. Other factors such as cultivation, soil and climaticconditions, harvesting time or postharvest management, can also determine EO composition andquality [39–42].4. Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi: Taxonomic Characterization, Distribution and UsesLesser calamint (CN) is a bushy, rhizomatous herb similar to the common mint in its morphologyand characteristic fragrance [5,43]. It is sparsely to densely pubescent perennial up to 80 cm, with leavesbroadly ovate, obtuse, subentire or shallowly to deeply crenate-serrate that are very fragrant whencrushed. Leaf is with up to nine teeth on each side. It typically forms a dense foliage usually foundon rocky sites, dry meadows and abandoned places. Tiny, tubular, two-lipped, lilac to white flowersappear in axillary spikes (cymes are 5- to 20-flowered). Calyx is 3–7 × 1–2 mm in diameter, sparsely todensely puberulent or pubescent, with the hairs in the mouth exserted; upper teeth are 0.5–1.5 mmin length, narrowly or broadly triangular; lower teeth 1–2 mm, puberulent, rarely with a few longcilia; corolla is from 10 to 15 mm (Figure 1). The plant grows in South, Western and South-CentralEurope, northwards to East England [15,18]. Lesser calamint usually grows in late spring and summer(May/June), flowering during late summer and fruiting in autumn. Then it becomes dormant in thewinter months, and re-blossoms in summer.Molecules 2017, 22, 290 3 of 49 polymorphism, but the compounds of monoterpenoids are found to prevail, especially the oxygenated p-menthane-type monoterpenoids.

Savi: Taxonomic Characterization, Distribution and Uses Lesser calamint (CN) is a bushy, rhizomatous herb similar to the common mint in its morphology and characteristic fragrance [5,43]. It is sparsely to densely pubescent perennial up to 80 cm, with leaves broadly ovate, obtuse, subentire or shallowly to deeply crenate-serrate that are very fragrant when crushed. Leaf is with up to nine teeth on each side. It typically forms a dense foliage usually found on rocky sites, dry meadows and abandoned places. Tiny, tubular, two-lipped, lilac to white flowers appear in axillary spikes (cymes are 5- to 20-flowered). Calyx is 3–7 × 1–2 mm in diameter, sparsely to densely puberulent or pubescent, with the hairs in the mouth exserted; upper teeth are 0.5–1.5 mm in length, narrowly or broadly triangular; lower teeth 1–2 mm, puberulent, rarely with a few long cilia; corolla is from 10 to 15 mm (Figure 1). The plant grows in South, Western and South-Central Europe, northwards to East England [15,18]. Lesser calamint usually grows in late spring and summer (May/June), flowering during late summer and fruiting in autumn. Then it becomes dormant in the winter months, and re-blossoms in summer.  Figure 1. Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi on its natural habitat in Tarquinia countryside (Viterbo, Italy) (photo: Mijat Božović, 2015). According to the European flora, CN includes two subspecies: nepeta and glandulosa, with the main differences in the number of flowers in cymes and leaf shape and size. Subspecies nepeta has 5–20 flowered cymes and leaves 20–35(–45) × 12–25(–30) mm, crenate-serrate with 5–9 teeth on each side. It is usually found on mountains of South and South-Central Europe. On the contrary, subspecies glandulosa has 5–11(15) flowered cymes, with leaves 10–20(–25) × 8–12 mm, subentire or shallowly crenate-serrate with up to 5 teeth on each side. It can be found in South and Western Europe [15]. These two subspecies share most of the uses and applications, since they are employed in folk medicine in diverse traditions. CN is well-known for its medicinal uses as a stimulant, tonic, antiseptic  and antispasmodic [11,13,26,36,44,45]. The chemical composition of its EO has been thoroughly  investigated [13,44–52], as well as EO antioxidant [11,17,53,54], antimicrobial [11,17,27,51,55–59], and anti-inflammatory activities [11,53]. In the folk medicine of different countries of the world, CN has Figure 1. Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi on its natural habitat in Tarquinia countryside (Viterbo, Italy)(photo: Mijat Božovic´, 2015).According to the European flora, CN includes two subspecies: nepeta and glandulosa, with themain differences in the number of flowers in cymes and leaf shape and size. Subspecies nepeta has5–20 flowered cymes and leaves 20–35(–45) × 12–25(–30) mm, crenate-serrate with 5–9 teeth on eachside. It is usually found on mountains of South and South-Central Europe. On the contrary, subspeciesglandulosa has 5–11(15) fl wered cymes, with leaves 10–20(–25) × 8–12 mm, subentire or shallowlycrenate-serrate with up to 5 teeth on each side. It can be found in South and Western Europe [15].These two subspecies share most of the uses and applications, since they are employed in folk medicinein diverse traditions. CN is well-known for its medicinal uses as a stimulant, tonic, antisepticand antispasmodic [11,13,26,36,44,45]. The chemical composition of its EO has been thoroughlyinvestigated [13,44–52], as well as EO antioxidant [11,17,53,54], antimicrobial [11,17,27,51,55–59],and anti-inflammatory activities [11,53]. In the folk medicine of different countries of the world,CN has also been widely used against insomnia, depression, convulsion and cramps [36,60] and forMolecules 2017, 22, 290 4 of 50the treatment of respiratory and gastroenteric diseases [11,61]. An infusion of leaves is employed totreat neurovegetative distony and epilepsy [61], and its eupeptic and carminative effects improvedigestion [62]. In several parts of Sicily it is used for the disinfection and cicatrization of wounds [57].Its use against gout, cough up slime and an external application of the leaves against hip pains, hasalso been reported [11,63]. As a result of its antiseptic and cicatrizing activity, it is used on insect bitesand wounds [64,65]. The plant has been traditionally used as a flavoring agent [18], and its EO is usedin cooking as an aromatic factor and also to improve the flavor and fragrance of several pharmaceuticalproducts [65,66]. It is also used as a spice in the Italian cuisine where it is called mentuccia or nipitella.Taxonomic Ambiguity and Synonyms of CNCalamintha Mill., Micromeria Benth., Satureja L., Clinopodium L. and Acinos Mill. are five closelyrelated genera of aromatic plants from the family Lamiaceae. The boundaries among them are poorlydefined, and their taxonomic treatment has changed many times. Some authors treated them as onlyone genus, Satureja sensu lato [67], while others recognized Micromeria, Satureja and Calamintha [68,69]or five separate genera [15,16,18]. These different conclusions suggest that more characters are neededto define the generic boundaries in this plant group [14].For this reason, the existing literature prospers in synonyms, and the genus Calamintha comprisesdifferent number of species depending on the authors. As already mentioned, the species in questionincludes two subspecies that can be found in the literature under a plenty of synonyms (Table 1).Table 1. Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi, its subspecies and the most common synonyms.Species Subspecies SynonymsCalamintha nepeta(L.)

Bartolucciet Conti and Satureja calamintha subsp. glandulosa (Req.) Gams, subsp.nepeta sensu Briq., subsp. subnuda (Waldst. et Kit.) GamsData collecting seems to be inexhaustible, and even bigger problem arises when it comes to thelevel of subspecies. Furthermore, sometimes the plant material was not characterized in the termsof subspecies (but determined only to the level of species), which makes it particularly hard to drawconclusions and to compare the existing data. Thus, their separation seems to be irrelevant, especiallytaking into account the possibility of uncompleted or even incorrect determination of material. On theother side, the question of valid recognition of these two taxa has been the subject of some earlierstudies. Three population of CN have been investigated from a morpho-anatomical and phytochemicalpoints of view. According to the authors it is impossible to distinguish the two taxa in CN complexon morphological grounds [70]. Morever, the forms at opposite ends of the range of morphologicalvariations can be displayed by individuals of a single population at different stages of their lifecycle and at different times of the year. In addition, a number of phytochemical studies have beenperformed, particularly on the EOs and volatile components. These studies have sometimes attemptedto contribute to a taxonomic understanding of the group, at generic [71], specific or intraspecificlevel [72,73]. However, according to the main part of literature, it can be concluded that the chemicalcomposition is quite independent of the subspecies and that they both can produce the same volatileswith the p-menthane skeleton oxygenated in C-3 [34,44,46–48].The nomenclature situation of these two taxa has been thoroughly discussed [74]. Examination ofthe diagnostic characteristics of the two subspecies has shown that many of them overlap, and togetherwith evidence from phytochemistry, led to the conclusion that it was impossible to find any featureswhich would allow the two taxa to be distinguished in practice. According to them, these are theseasonal morphs rather than discrete taxa, and they not deserve recognition at any rate higher thana super-varietal level.Molecules 2017, 22, 290 5 of 50Taking everything mentioned into account, hereby we have indiscriminately collected data ofeither subspecies, as well as of the numerous synonyms, marking them all as CN (the level of species).5. Essential Oil Composition of CNThe literature data clearly indicate the presence of a remarkable chemical polymorphism and greatintraspecific variability. Some authors observed that the oil composition seemed to be independentof the geographical origin of the sample [34,75], while others reported a strong chemical variabilitydepending on the origin of the samples [51], as well as environmental conditions on the nature ofplant chemical composition [17]. Described chemotypes are diverse, but the major components in theoils generally belong to the C-3 oxygenated p-menthanes such as PUL, menthone, isomenthone,and piperitone and piperitenone with their oxides or, more rarely, C-6 oxygenated p-menthanecompounds such as carvone (Table 2) [17,23]. Our literature survey has discovered plenty of data,but at least three types of oils can be distinguished, with some exceptions:(I) The first and the most abundant one consists of PUL as the major component associated withother compounds. Two main variants of this chemotype can be defined as follows: (1) the onepresented by PUL and menthone and/or isomenthone, menthol and its isomers, and (2) the otherwhere PUL is associated with piperitenone, or piperitone and piperitenone oxides;(II) The second chemotype can be considered as piperitone oxide or the piperitone oxide/piperitenoneoxide one. A piperitone/piperitenone variant of this chemotype was only reported for someCroatian material [17];(III) Lastly, the rarest one is distinguished by the presence of carvone and 1,8-cineole.Table 2.

Some authors obs rved that the oil co position seemed to be independent of the geographical rigin of th  sample [34,75], while thers re rted a strong chemical variability depending on t e origin of the samples [51]  as ell as environmental conditions on the nature of plant chemical c mposition [17]. Described ch motypes are diverse, but the major components i  the oils generally belong to the C-3 oxygenat d p-menth nes such as PUL, menthone, iso e thone, and piperitone and piperitenone with their oxides or, mor  rarely, C-6 oxyg ated p-menthane compounds such as carvone (Table 2) [17,23]. Our literature survey has discovered plenty of dat , but at least three types of oils can e distinguish d, with som  exc ptions:  (I) The first and the most abundant one consists of PUL as the major component associated with other compounds. Two main vari s of this chemotype c n b  efined as follows: (1) the one presented by PUL and menthone and/or isomenthone, menthol and its isomers, and (2) the other wh r  PUL is associated with piperiten ne, r piperitone and piperitenone oxides; (II) The secon chemotype can be considered as piperitone oxid  r the piperitone oxide/piperitenone oxid  one. A piperitone/piperitenone variant of this ch motype was only reported for som  Croatian material [17]; (III) L stly, the rarest one is distinguished by the presence of carvone and 1,8-cineole.

Taking e ery hing mentioned into account, hereby we have indiscriminately collected data of either subspeci s, as well as of th  numerous synonyms, marking them all as CN (the lev l of species). 5. Essential Oil Composition of CN The literature data clearly indicate the pr enc  of a remarkable che ical poly orphism and great intraspecific variability. Some authors observed that the oil co positi n seemed to be indepe dent of the geographical origin of t e ampl  [34,75], while others reported a strong chemical variability depending on the origin of the samples [51], as well as envi onmental conditions on the n ture of plant chemical composition [17]. D cribed chemotypes are diverse, but the major com onents in the oils generally belong to the C-3 oxygenated p-menthan s such as PUL, menthone, iso enthone, and piperitone and piperi enone with their oxides or, more rarely, C-6 oxygenated p-ment ane compounds such as carv  (Table 2) [17,23]. Our lit rature survey has disc ver d plenty of data, but at least three type  of oils can be distinguished, w h som  exceptions:  (I) The first and the mos  abundant one consist  of PUL as the maj r component associated with other compounds. Two main variants f this chemotype can be defined as follows: (1) the one presented by PUL and menthone and/or i menthone, menthol and its isomer , and (2) the other where PUL is associ te  with piperitenone, or piperitone and piperitenone xide ; (II) The e ond chemotype ca  be c nsidered as piperitone oxide or th  piperitone oxide/piperitenone oxide one. A piperi on /piperitenone variant of this chem type was only rep rt d for some Croatian material [17]; (III) Las ly, the rarest one is distinguished by the presence of carvone and 1,8-cineole.

Italian material from different regions has been investigated extensively and plenty of data are available in the literature. All three chemotypes have been reported. About 50% of PUL in the oil from Tuscany was reported, and menthone (9.4%), limonene (7.0%), menthol (4.6%), piperitenone-oxide (4.6%) and piperitone-oxide (3.9%) were also present [57]. Samples from Sardinia were characterized by the high content of PUL (39.9%–64.4%), but piperitenone (6.4%–7.7%) and piperitenone oxide (2.5%–19.1%) were also found to be important components [51]. A rather big amount of PUL was reported for the stems and cymes (30% and 28%–52%, respectively) collected in Pisa area [70], and the same analysis included stem samples rich in piperitone oxide (13%–38%), and both stems and cymes with the high content of piperitenone oxide (18% and 22%, respectively). Additional study included material from this region showing PUL (46%), menthone (9.82%), limonene (6.4%) and menthol (4.82%) as major components [55]. The samples from Sicily are also characterized by PUL (21.4%–25.2%) and other ketones with p-menthane skeleton, such as menthone (11.6%–19.8%), piperitone (6.4%–13.1%), piperitenone (12.3%–16.4%) and isomenthone (2.1%–12.0%) [36]. Another analysis on the material collected in Urbino [73] showed the particular richness in piperitone oxide (68%) with the presence of a limited amount of piperitenone oxide (3.4%), as well as the presence in significant quantities of limonene (2%), isopulegol (4%), isopulegyl acetate (2.3%) and thymol (1.2%). A comprehensive study on different samples from Tarquinia countryside was also recently reported [76]. The material was analyzed in terms of different harvesting period (4 months, from July to October 2014) and extraction duration (from 1 to 24 h). The analysis revealed the PUL/menthone chemotype, but the ratio varied greatly according to the plant’s phenophase, with the greatest increase of menthone percentage during the fruiting period. PUL was particularly abundant in July and August (77.7% and 84.7%, respectively), reaching its maximum during the first three h of extraction, while menthone percentage increased at the blooming period (up to 35.4%). Chrysanthenone gradually increased its amount with the extraction time (up to 33.9%), and a significant amount of limonene was observed (up to 13.6%). Leaves, stems and flowers were sampled in Calabria at the beginning of the flowering stage, and PUL was the main constituent (58.85%), along with p-menthone (7.45%), menthol (3.89%) and piperitenone (3.34%) [77]. Another study included the material from Apulia and reported the presence of four oil types: piperitone oxide, piperitenone oxide, piperitone-menthone and PUL [52]. The material from Liguria region (North of Italy) was characterized by 23.6% of PUL, 15.8% of piperitenone, 15.3% menthone and 14.9% of piperitenone oxide among others [56]. The material sampled in Piedmont region at the full bloom showed the predominance of PUL (73.65%) and the lack of menthone (only 0.25%). cis-Piperitone (4.56%), limonene (3.54%), cis-piperitone oxide (2.48%), isomenthone (2.39%), germacrene D (2.35%) and isopulegone (1.89%) were also found [42]. The work included different postharvest management (dehumidifying and oven-drying of the material) impacts on the yield and the EO chemical profile. They both were significantly affected, with the dehumidifying process leading to a significantly higher EO content than the oven-drying process (2.625% and 0.101%, respectively, in regard to 0.242% in the fresh material). PUL was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The amount of limonene was decreased by the both processes (up to 36.2% less), while the sesquiterpenes germacrene D and β-caryophyllene were affected mainly by the oven-drying method (86.5 and 157.3% higher than the fresh samples). The same method greatly increased the menthone content (total of 5.38% in the oil). Additionally, some analysis on the material of Italian origin differ largely, supporting the hypothesis of the great chemical variability present in this species.

The same method greatly increased the menthone content (total of 5.38% in the oil).Additionally, some analysis on the material of Italian origin differ largely, supporting the hypothesis ofthe great chemical variability present in this species. For instance, the oil from the Campania regionwas characterized by a prevalence of the sesquiterpenic fraction, with 1,10-di-epi-cubenol (18.5%),cadalene (5.7%) and allo-aromadendrene epoxide (11.4%) as the main constituents [24], while the highcontent of carvone, followed by carvacrol and limonene, has also been reported for the material fromdifferent areas of the “Appennino marchigiano” [78]. High contents of carvone (64.3%) and PUL (10.9%)in the oil obtained from a commercial source have also been reported [79].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 7 of 50An important chemical variability has been observed for CN growing wild in Corsica [34]. A totalof 40 samples was analyzed (Table 3), and the half was characterized by the predominance of menthone(mean content 43.4%). PUL (18.9%), trans-piperitone oxide (8.3%) and limonene (5.2%) were alsoimportant constituents. Other compounds occurred occasionally in substantial amounts: isomenthone(up to 16%), piperitone (up to 12.2%), neomenthol (up to 10%) and piperitenone (up to 7.1%). Thirteensamples from that study were characterized by a strong predominance of PUL (55.6%) over menthone(20%), and all the samples contained regular amounts of limonene (6%). trans-Piperitone oxide (30.5%)and piperitenone oxide (12.5%) were the main components of the last 11 samples, with the largeamounts of limonene (12.8%), while PUL and menthone were less represented. According to theauthors, PUL is strongly predominant from the beginning of the vegetative life to August (63%–78%).Its percentage reaches a maximum in early July and decreases at the beginning of the floweringstage, while the amount of menthone undergoes the reverse evolution. It seems possible to establisha negative correlation between these two compounds [34]. The other analysis included material fromthe same area, showing PUL/menthone chemotype as the most frequent one. These two compoundsrepresented together between 70% and 85% of the total oil composition, but the ratio varied greatlyin terms of growth plant stage: the menthone percentage increased at the blossoming period, whilePUL% decreased [44]. This is in accordance with another study of the material harvested in autumn inthe vicinity of Marseilles, showing menthone (52.7%) as the most dominant compound, along withPUL (9.1%), piperitone (7.8%), neomenthol (7.6%), menthol (4.3%) and limonene (4%) [80].The material from Greece has also been found to have very variable composition. One studyreported 39.7% of PUL in the oil from the island of Lefkada, with menthone (24.7%) and isomenthone(25.6%) among others [49]. The presence of at least 46 compounds in the oil was also reported, and themajor ones were found to be the two diastereoisomers of piperitone oxide (55%) and β-bisabolene(8.5%) [81]. Another study on material of Greek origin showed 41% of PUL and 32% of menthone,with piperitone (7.3%) and piperitenone (7%) as important constituents [82], while two chemotypeswere noted by others [75]. The first was rich in PUL and/or menthone and/or isomenthone, andthe sum of the contents of these three ketones ranged from 56.8% to 89.9%. The second was foundto be rich in cis- and trans-piperitone oxide and/or piperitenone oxide, and the sum of these threeepoxides ranged from 65.5% to 90%. The co-occurrence of two chemotypes within the same population(intra-populational variation) has also been reported for the material on the Island of Zakynthos [35].C-3 oxygenated p-menthane compounds and their precursor limonene constituted from 68.8% to 92.8%of the oils. The main constituents of the first chemotype were PUL, menthone, piperitenone andpiperitone, while cis- and trans-piperitone oxide, limonene and piperitenone oxide were noted for thesecond one. The study included different plant organs (inflorescences, leaves and stems) and differentdevelopment periods of plant (vegetative and flowering stages). Differences in the percentage of themain constituents were observed between the oils from the different organs in the same developmentalstage, as well as between the same organs in different developmental stages.Several studies on the Turkish material confirmed the presence of different chemotypes.23 components have been identified, with PUL (42%) and piperitenone (40.4%) being the majorones [50]. Another analysis of the Turkish material showed PUL and menthone (40.5% and 23.6%,respectively) as the more important components, followed by piperitone and piperitone oxide(9.3%) [45]. Oxygenated monoterpenes PUL (54%) and menthone (16%) were also found to bethe major constituents of the oil from Istanbul [11], while the predominance of piperitenone oxide(43.8%), trans-piperitone oxide (25.2%) and limonene (13%) was reported by other authors [83].A comprehensive study on the samples from different regions in Turkey (Ice˛l, Bartin, Zonguldakand Manisa) was reported [13]. The analysis confirmed the dominance of 3-oxo compounds, but alsoshowed that their 1,2-epoxy derivatives may predominate in some oils. trans-Piperitone oxide (44.4%),piperitenone oxide (11.7%) and limonene (7.1%) were the main constituents in some samples, whileother had trans-piperitone oxide (30.9%) associated with caryophyllene oxide (7.8%). The high presenceof PUL (up to 19.5%) and menthone (up to 11.9%) was noted for some samples, but carvacrol (10%)Molecules 2017, 22, 290 8 of 50and limonene (7.5%) were also found in the part of them. A type containing caryophyllene oxide(7.9%), trans-piperitone oxide (5.7%) and menthol (5%) was also detected. Others [84] have confirmedthe prevalence of cis-piperitone epoxide (48.66%), piperitenone oxide (22.08%), limonene (13.51%) andterpinen-4-ol (4.55%), while other analysis of the Turkish material showed PUL (76.5%) and piperitone(6.1%) as the main constituents [85]. cis-Piperitone epoxide (48.66%), piperitenone oxide (22.08%),limonene (13.51%) and terpinen-4-ol (4.55%) have been also reported as the main compounds [60],and the authors highlighted prevalence of monoterpenes (89.19%). The oils obtained from wild plantsgrowing in Mediterranean region of Turkey revealed two different oil’s composition: one rich inpiperitone oxide (33.78%), piperitenone oxide (15.79%) and isomenthone (11.17%), and the other withPUL (48.44%) and menthone (38.69%) in prevalence [86].The oil extracted from Portuguese material was predominantly composed of isomenthone(35.8%–51.3%), 1,8-cineole (21.1%–21.4%) and trans-isopulegone (7.8%–6.0%), which makes this oilquite peculiar and rather different from those of other origins; the authors marked it as a new oiltype [51].Table 3.

SD = standard deviation.The presence of carvone (37.6%) and 1,8-cineole (34.9%) along with limonene (11.5%) as the maincompounds has been reported for the Spanish material presenting the 2-oxygenated p-menthanictype [87]. According to the authors, a simple dominant gene A favors production of PUL frompiperitone, but its lack leads instead to the production of terminal types, such as piperitone,1,2-epoxy-p-menthanes or menthone/isomenthone. Carvone production appears to be due to a singledominant gene C, which is epistatic for the gene involved in the complex system of 3-oxygenatedp-menthane constituents; this gene is apparently linked to another dominant gene Lm which leads tolimonene production.Molecules 2017, 22, 290 9 of 50Detailed chemotaxonomic studies were undertaken on the Belgian material [46–48]. The oils’composition ranged from the very simple, containing almost exclusively piperitone oxide andpiperitenone oxide (30.7%–74.2% and 4.7%–52%, respectively), to the relative complex, containingthe oxidized precursors PUL, menthone, menthol and their acetates. The authors noticed that thehigh concentrations of piperitone oxide and piperitenone oxide were found to be depended on thematurity of the plants [46]. On the other hand, several samples they analyzed contained considerableamounts of PUL (up to 57.7%), menthol and menthone, but were also rich in the oxides of piperitoneand piperitenone [48].A Montenegran sample was rich in PUL (37.5%), menthone (17.6%), piperitenone (15%) andpiperitone (10.2%) [58], while the predominance of carvacrol (79.91%) was reported by others [88].The min component (approximately 37%–45%) of the oils from material naturally occurring inCroatia varied as follows: PUL (three samples), piperitenone oxide (two samples) and menthone(one sample) [89]. For this region, the prevalence of oxygenated monoterpenes with piperitone(19.9%–59.5%) and piperitenone (7.1%–42.6%) as the main representatives has also been reported [17],while the material from Dalmatia, near Split, has been found to contain monoterpene oxides such aspiperitone oxide (46.0%), piperitenone oxide (12.7%) and limonene (10.9%) [90].The material from Serbia was rich in PUL (75.5%), piperitenone oxide (6%), menthone (5.3%)and menthol (4.3%) [33], while another study showed the predominance of piperitone oxide (59.09%),with limonene (9.05%), cis-sabinene hydrate (4.45%) and 4-terpineol (4.77%) among others [59].A high amount of easily volatile compounds was remarked in the oils extracted from the materialcultivated in Romania [25]. Some samples were characterized by a great content of PUL (48.7%)followed by p-menthone (28.3%), while others contained estragol as the major compound (54.95%),followed by mentone (20.19%) and PUL (12.87%).Carvone (46.7%), PUL (22.1%) and limonene (24.6%) as the main components were found in thematerial from Iran [91]. Other authors [92] showed that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (β-bisabolene9.9%, germacrene D 7.6%, β-bourbonene 7.4%) and monoterpene ketone piperitone (5.3%) are themajor compounds of the oil with the same origin.Analysis of Egyptian material revealed 64 components with carvone as the main one (38.7%),followed by neo-dihydrocarveol (9.9%), dihydrocarveol (6.9%), dihydrocarveol acetate (7.6%),1,8-cineole (6.4%), cis-carvyl acetate (6.1%), and PUL (4.1%) [65]. Others [93] have reported 1,8-cineole(36.6%) as the major component, followed by PUL (17.9%) and limonene (9.2%) for the Moroccanmaterial, while other analysis of the same origin material found ρ-cymene (20.9%), γ-terpinene (18.7%)and thymol (34.94%) as the most abundant constituents [94]. The material sampled in North Moroccogave the oil rich in 1,8-cineole (42.94%), β-phellandrene (11.39%) and pinocamphone (9.88%), with ahigh proportion of monoterpenes (76.09%) in comparison with sesquiterpenes (7.29%) [95]. Aerial partsat the flowering stage were sampled in Algeria, and the most abundant components of the oil werementhone (26.46%), piperitone oxide (22.26%) and PUL (14.04%) [96]. Another study from this regionshowed the oxygenated monoterpenes as the predominant class, with PUL (39.5%), neo-menthol (33%)and isomenthone (19.6%) as the major constituents [97].As a part of the research on aromatic plants from Argentina, the oil composition of the leaves ofCN has been examined showing PUL (34.28%), neomenthol (30.61%) and menthone (17.12%) as majorconstituents [98].The oil from a cultivated population of CN in South India revealed the prevalence of menthone(43.4%), with significantly lower amounts of piperitone oxide, carvone, menthol, piperitenone,limonene, linalool and beta-caryophyllene [99]. The author marked it as a new menthone chemotype.6. Antimicrobial Activity of CNInfectious diseases represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality among thegeneral population, particularly in developing countries [100]. However, due to indiscriminateuse of antimicrobial synthetic chemicals in their treatment, both human and plant pathogenicMolecules 2017, 22, 290 10 of 50microorganisms have developed resistance to multiple drugs/chemical substances. In addition,these chemical compounds can cause undesirable effects on environment because of their slowbiodegradation and serious side effects on mammalian health because of toxic residues in agriculturalproducts [59,84,101,102]. Consequently, there is an increased interest in developing new antimicrobialdrugs from various natural sources, especially aromatic and medicinal plants.Among many plant products, EOs are the most studied plant secondary metabolites [103].Along with extracts, they represent potential sources of novel antimicrobial compounds.Their antimicrobial evaluations are generally difficult because of their volatility, insolubility in waterand complex chemistry [104,105]. However, the antimicrobial activity of EOs has been extensivelystudied and demonstrated against a number of microorganisms, usually using direct-contactantimicrobial assays, such as different types of diffusion or dilution methods, as reviewed by manyauthors [2]. In these tests, EOs are brought into direct contact with the selected microorganisms. Due totheir high hydrophobicity and volatility, the direct-contact assays face many problems. In diffusionassays, the EOs components are partitioned through the agar according to their affinity with water,and in dilution methods low water solubility has to be overcome by addition of emulsifiers or solvents(such as DMSO or ethanol) which may alter the activity [106].A wide variety of EOs is known to possess antimicrobial properties due to the presence of activemonoterpene constituents [4]. Antimicrobial action is often determined by more than one component;each of them contributes to the beneficial or adverse effects. The major component may not be theonly one responsible for the antimicrobial activity but a synergistic effect may take place with otheroil components [2,107]. Possible interactions among conventional drugs and products obtained frommedicinal plants are observed, motivating researchers to test the possibilities of their synergism. It mustbe emphasized that these interactions depend on several factors including pharmacokinetics and employeddoses, since combinations confirmed in vitro may not have the same effect on humans [100,108].According to the literature survey, different calamint species have been investigated in search forantimicrobial activities [79,95,109–112], including several analyses performed on CN with an aim toinvestigate its antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral effects.For instance, the oil from the Algerian material was assayed for its antimicrobial activity againstsix bacteria and two fungi, resulting in a range of growth inhibition patterns against pathogenicmicroorganisms (MIC values from 0.125% to 0.5%). The results revealed Staphylococcus aureus asthe most sensitive bacteria (the MIC value was 0.25% and the inhibition zone was 40.6 mm), whilePseudomonas aeruginosa appeared as the most resistant one [97]. The authors noted that the antimicrobialactivity could be attributed to its high content of compounds with known antimicrobial activity, such asmenthone and PUL. Another analysis on the same origin material assessed antifungal activity againsttwo post-harvest pathogenic fungal strains from Fusarium and Aspergillus genera [96]. The resultsin vitro demonstrated an excellent antifungal property of this oil, and the authors pointed out that thisactivity can be attributed to oil’s high amount of menthone, piperitone oxide and PUL. A group ofauthors from Algeria investigated the effectiveness of increasing doses of three EOs (including CN) inthe inhibition of methanogenesis in the rumen, and their effects on in vitro ruminal fermentation traitsof vetch-oat hay [113]. Addition of EOs in the culture media at all doses reduced methane production,with the effect more pronounced after 24h of incubation. As reported, this was mainly attributedto antimicrobial activity of EOs since they exert antimicrobial activity by multiple mechanisms ofaction and can inhibit a broad variety of both Gram(+) and Gram(−) bacteria and other ruminalmicroorganisms [114–116]. The results also showed the decrease of ammonia N concentrations andsome authors suggest that EOs reduce ammonia N by inhibition of deamination which is assuredprincipally by ammonia hyperproducing bacteria [117]. According to some authors [118], the decreasein ammonia concentration could result from a negative effect on protozoa and thus a decrease inpredation of bacteria.The oil distilled from Moroccan plants failed to show antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea [93],while another study included five Gram(+) and four Gram(−) bacteria [95]. Depending on theMolecules 2017, 22, 290 11 of 50microorganism tested, the last analysis showed from good to moderate activity of EOCN, with theMIC value from 0.5 to 14 µL·mL−1. The most susceptible bacterium was Listeria monocytogenes, whileSalmonella Senftenberg and Yersinia enterocolitica seemed to be the most resistant ones. Quite goodactivity was also noticed against S. aureus (2 µL·mL−1) and Bacillus subtilis (4 µL·mL−1). Regarding thebactericidal activity, Gram(+) bacteria were more susceptible than Gram(+) ones, and no bactericidaleffect was observed against S. Senftenberg, Y. enterocolitica and Enterococcus faecium. In general, whenEOs act alone, their high doses are required to achieve the significant antimicrobial effect. Therefore,the development of new strategies that allow the increase of their efficacy at lower concentrations isneeded. The authors have also analysed a possible synergistic lethal effects against Escherichia coli andL. monocytogenes in combination with mild heat or emerging methods: high hydrostatic pressure (HPP)and pulsed electric fields (PEF). The results demonstrated the occurrence of additive and outstandingsynergistic lethal effects when combining all three treatments with the EO at the low dose proposed(0.2 µL·mL−1). The authors suggested sublethal injuries caused by the heat, making cells sensitiveto the bactericide action of the oil. According to them, that could be related to the high content ofPUL and 1,8-cineole. Regarding the HHP treatment, the outstanding synergistic effect was observed,especially against L. monocytogenes, whereas the combination with PEF treatment was much lesseffective showing additive effect rather than synergistic. Therefore, the obtained data confirmed thepossibility of the application of alternatives to traditional treatments, offering a great potential byreducing treatment intensity and doses of antimicrobials, and consequently adverse effects on foodquality, while enhancing the antimicrobial security of foods [119–122].Egyptian material rich in carvone [65] showed a significant antimicrobial activity, and the strongestone on S. aureus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. The authors highlighted carvone’s antimicrobialactivity reported by some authors [123,124], as well as its possible synergistic effect with minorcomponents that possess antimicrobial activity [27,125,126].Evaluation of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Lethal Concentration(MLC) values included two samples from Sardinia and Portugal [51]. The oils were tested againstdifferent Candida strains (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. guillermondii and C. parapsilosis) andthe following dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, M. gypseum,Cryptococcus neoformans, Epidermophyton floccosum, A. niger, A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The Italian oil wasmore active than the Portuguese one, exhibiting the significant antifungal activity against Aspergillusand dermatophyte strains, with MIC values from 0.32 to 1.25 µL·mL−1. The authors concluded thatthe highest antifungal activity of the Sardinian oil can be associated with the contribution of PUL,and suggested its use for therapeutical purposes, particularly in the treatment of dermatophytosisand aspergillosis.The antimicrobial investigations of Italian material collected in Pisa area [57] were performedagainst the Gram(+) bacteria L. monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus, the Gram(+) Salmonella veneziana,S. paratyphi B and S. typhimurium, and the fungi Fusarium moniliforme, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus nigerand Pyricularia oryzae. The oil showed a wide antimicrobial spectrum of action, and noteworthy isthe effectiveness on some mycetes parasites of higher plants, as well as the strong activity against allthe Salmonella species, etiologic agents of many food poisonings. Some authors have marked the oilfrom this region as a very powerful one [55]. In that study, bacteria S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa andB. subtilis were tested, as well as fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans. The PUL-rich oil showedgood potency against all tested microorganisms, particularly against B. subtilis (MIC was 2 µg·mL−1).The authors emphasized as an interesting fact that P. aeruginosa, known to be very resistant even tosynthetic drugs, was found to be very susceptible to the oil. According to the authors, the activitycould be due to the presence of the ketones menthone and PUL or piperitone and piperitenone withtheir oxides. The fungistatic and fungicidal activities of the oil from Italian material, even at low doses,were detected in vitro on M. canis and M. gypseum, mycetes responsible for human cutaneous mycosesspread by domestic animals [56].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 12 of 50The in vitro anti-Candida albicans activity of 44 samples from Tarquinia has been reportedrecently [76]. The samples were prepared from the material collected in four different months and bysteam distillation process of different duration (1 to 24 h). The oils were found to belong to the PUL-richchemotype, with the particular increase of menthone amount during the reproductive periods of theplant (September-October). With few exceptions, the MIC of this strain ranged from 6.24 mg·mL−1to 12.48 mg·mL−1 for the oils extracted in July and October, and from 3.12 to 12.48 mg·mL−1 forthe ones extracted in August and September. Notably, some samples showed an interesting andsignificant antifungal activity with MIC ranging from 0.78 to 1.56 mg·mL−1. Usually, the third fraction(between second and third h of extraction) showed good activity, or even the fourth one (between thirdand sixth h) in the case of September. October was characterized by lack of any significant activity.These results are not in accordance with the observations indicating that PUL and/or menthone are theconstituents responsible for the antimicrobial activity of EOCN. It is clear that other minor chemicalsare endowed with microbiological activities and may co-participate in the inhibition process withsome synergistic mechanism [107] and it is somehow in agreement with the phytocomplex hypothesisreported in many other experimental observations [127,128]. The analysis has also indicated the lackof any significant correlation between the antimicrobial activity and the plant’s phenophase. Somehow,this is in contrast with some bibliographic data reporting that EOs obtained during flowering seasonof a plant exhibit the most significant antimicrobial activity [2,129,130].The oil from Montenegro was screened against the bacteria E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa,Salmonella enteritidis and the fungus A. niger. All the microorganisms except S. enteritidis werefound to be susceptible, specifically A. niger [58]. This was confirmed by another study whichincluded the material collected in Serbia and the same test microorganisms [33]. It was found thatall microorganisms were susceptible to the oil at all oil dilutions; however, the oil activity declinedwith dilution. The material from Serbia was tested against 11 model bacteria, and the results showedthat the EO possessed antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms with the range ofMIC values from 0.025 to 1.56 µL·mL−1 and MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentration) values from0.05 to 1.56 µL·mL−1 [59]. The low activity was observed against Gram(−) S. enteritidis and E. coli(0.78 µL·mL−1) and Gram(+) strains of S. aureus (1.56 µL·mL−1), while B. cereus and P. aeruginosa weremoderately sensitive to the oil (0.1 µL·mL−1). The highest activity (0.025 µL·mL−1) was found withsome ATCC strains of P. aeruginosa and B. cereus, as well as against E. coli from feces.Antimicrobial activity of the Turkish sample was evaluated, using the disc diffusion method.That study showed that all the tested bacteria (particularly B. subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) and C. albicans were affected by the EO. The authors explained thatby the high percentage of PUL and menthol [27]. The antibacterial properties of the oil obtainedfrom the Turkish material was evaluated against 20 phytopathogenic bacteria [84]. The resultsrevealed that the oil exhibited strong antibacterial activities against most of the tested bacteria.Both Gram(+) and Gram(−) bacteria were sensitive (the MIC value was 7.81 µg·mL−1), withno significant difference in susceptibility between them. The analysis included the followingmicroorganisms: Clavibacter michiganensis, Bacillus pumilus, Enterobacter intermedius, Erwinia caratovora,E. chrysanthemi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. cichorii, P. corrugate, P. syringae (pv. syringae from differenthosts, pv. tomato, pv. phaseolicola, pv. pisi and pv. tabaci), Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ralstonia solanacearum,Xanthomonas vesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. campestris. The authors associated the high antibacterialeffect with the presence of many components, pointing out the possible synergistic and antagonisticeffects of the main chemicals and minor components in the oil.However, assessing EOs food protection, CN was tested against 10 bacteria and failed to showany significant efficacy [131].The mechanisms by which EOs inhibit microorganisms involves different modes of action,but may be due in part to their hydrophobicity. As a result, they cause lipid partitioning ofbacterial cell membranes and mitochondria, disturbing the cell structures and rendering them morepermeable [100,132–134]. Extensive leakage from bacterial cells or the exit of critical molecules andMolecules 2017, 22, 290 13 of 50ions, will lead to death [6]. Impairment of bacterial enzyme systems may also be a potential mechanismof antimicrobial action [135]. Cyclic hydrocarbons act on ATPases, enzymes known to be locatedat the cytoplasmic membrane and surrounded by lipid molecules. In addition, lipid hydrocarbonsmay distort the lipid-protein interaction, and the direct interaction of lipophilic compounds withhydrophobic parts of the protein is also possible [100,134]. It was found that some EOs stimulatethe growth of pseudo-mycelia, indicating that they may act on enzymes involved in the synthesis ofbacterium structural components [136].The antimicrobial activity of the EOs can also be explained by the lipophilic character of themonoterpenes contained. The monoterpenes act by disrupting the microbial cytoplasmic membrane,which thus loses its high impermeability for protons and bigger ions. If the membrane integrity isdisrupted, then its functions are compromised not only as a barrier but also as a matrix for enzymesand as an energy transducer. However, specific mechanisms involved in the antimicrobial actionof monoterpenes remain poorly characterized [137]. According to a number of authors, Gram(−)bacteria are generally less susceptible than Gram(+) bacteria to the actions of EOs, due to their outermembrane surrounding the cell wall which restricts diffusion of hydrophobic compounds throughits polysaccharide covering [138–141]. This effect seems to be dependent on lipid composition andnet surface charge of microbial membranes [139]. This statement is not always true; indeed differentauthors found no differences or greater sensibility of Gram(−) bacteria than Gram(+) to EOs [142,143].Some antimicrobial and antifungal abilities have been reported for monoterpenes [144], andsome Calamintha species have been investigated as well [71]. The authors concluded that the activityappeared to be due to the monoterpene compounds of the oil [71]. It is also known that p-menthaneketones are effective towards a number of microorganisms [145], while PUL has found to exhibit highantimicrobial activity, especially on S. typhimurium and S. aureus [146]. Also, it was demonstrated thatPUL is the constituent responsible for the antimicrobial activity in the oil of CN [57].In addition, different extracts and fractions were investigated against Gram(+) B. subtilis andGram(−) E. coli and S. typhimurium. The analysis showed better activity of the water extract thenthe methanolic one, while the fractions prepared had greater bactericidal efficacy, especially thedichloromethane one. However, methanolic extract and the ethyl acetate fraction failed to inhibit alltested bacteria [147]. Another study assessed the antimicrobial activities of the methanolic, ethanolicand petroleum ether extracts of CN of Turkish origin, using the disc diffusion and microdilutionmethods. As a result, strong antifungal effect was found just for the ethanolic and petroleum etherextracts against Fusarium proliferatum (1.6 mg·mL−1), while the other tested bacteria and fungi wereinhibited only by the higher concentrations (from 6.3 mg·mL−1 to 12.5 mg·mL−1) [148]. Methanolicextract from the Turkish material from Sinop showed good antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis andC. parapilosis [149].In addition, the preservative activity and potential of CN and its use in cosmetics have beenalso presented [79,150]. Preservatives are included in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations toprotect the product from microbial insults occurring from raw materials, manufacture and consumeruse. A recent trend in cosmetic preservation is to avoid the use of chemical agents, leading scientiststo search for natural antimicrobial alternatives. EOCN from a commercial source was analyzed andshowed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans and A. niger [79]. On the contrary,its activity against P. aeruginosa, an organism intrinsically resistant to a wide variety of antimicrobialagents, was unsatisfactory. The authors hypothesized that it was probably due to the impermeabilityof the outer membrane to hydrophobic and high molecular weight hydrophilic drugs, as it hasbeen already reported [151,152]. However, the good activity of the association EO–EDTA againstP. aeruginosa confirms that while the essence itself hardly crosses the outer membrane of the bacterium,its combination with EDTA allows it to reach the inner part of the cells. In fact EDTA chelates theCa2+ and Mg2+ ions that play an important role in the stability of the outer membrane complex, as it isreported [153]. The preserving activity of the EOCN in cetomacrogol cream was proved to be satisfying,Molecules 2017, 22, 290 14 of 50although less than one observed in culture medium. According to the authors, effective preservationwas also achieved thanks to the high concentration of carvone which was a main constituent of EOCN.In the other study, the oil was assayed for its activity in two different formulations (cream andshampoo). Preservation effect was limited to higher concentration (2%), with no significant differencesbetween standard and wild strains either in single or mixed cultures, but the nature of formulationin which it was incorporated had considerable effect on its efficacy [150]. The higher concentrationrequired for good preservation of the cream, could be explained by the lipophilic affinity of the EO forliquid paraffin, the major cream’s compound. Although EOs are often highly lipophilic compoundsinsoluble in the aqueous phases, in many cases they have a relative hydrophilicity given by thepresence of constituents with polar functional groups. According to the authors, that oil’s affinity forliquid paraffin probably reduced the EO bioavailability in aqueous phase, requiring higher percentageto avoid bacterial recovery and/or possible infection spreading. This was confirmed by some otherauthors [154]. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity was more effective against the Gram(−) bacteriathat may have been due to the presence of EDTA in the cream that acted as synergic agent. In thecase of shampoo formulation, used concentration was insufficient to reduce the Gram(+) inoculum.The authors explained it by the presence of surfactants, already reported in the literature [154,155].On the contrary, for Gram(−) bacteria, the EO-preserved shampoo showed a satisfactory preservativeefficacy. Also here, interfering factors could have influenced the oil effectiveness. Surfactantsare organic compounds composed of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, normally found indetergents and shampoos. They reduce surface tension, thereby diminishing interfacial forces andleading to the formation of a micellar structure. The affinity of the EO for the surfactant micelle couldhave lowered the oil bioavailability and then partially neutralized its antimicrobial activity as well asliquid paraffin in the cream formulation [150].7. Antioxidant Properties of EOCNFree radicals are considered to initiate oxidation that leads to aging and causes diseases in humanbeings. Moreover, activated oxygen incorporates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which consists of free(hydroxyl or superoxide anion radicals) or non-free radicals (peroxide) [156]. ROS are liberated byvirtue of stress, and thus, an imbalance is developed in the body that damages cells in it and causeshealth problems [157]. On the other hand, restriction on the use of synthetic antioxidants has beenimposed, because of their carcinogenicity and other toxic properties, which has increased considerablythe interest in natural antioxidants [31,158].The active ingredients of a medicinal plant are mainly its secondary metabolites, and naturalantioxidants can be phenolic compounds (tocopherols, flavonoids and phenolic acids) or carotenoids(lutein, lycopene and carotene) [31,159]. The interest in phenolic antioxidants has increased remarkablyin the last decade due to their great capacity to scavenge free radicals associated with various humandiseases. Phenolic compounds, particularly flavonoids which are present in all vascular plants,are involved in many physiological processes; they are stress biomarkers ensuring the survival of plantsunder different environmental conditions, but they are also included in plant protection. In general,the antioxidative effectiveness of plant extracts depends of the content of phenolic compounds andthe reaction activity of the phenol towards the chain-carrying peroxyl radicals and on the stabilityof the phenoxyl radical formed in the reaction [17]. This has also been reported by many authors,indicating a considerable role of high phenolics content in antioxidant activity [160,161], and due totheir several hydroxyl groups, flavonoids have been shown to be highly effective scavengers of variousfree radicals [162,163]. However, according to some others, the antioxidant activity of an extract cannotbe predicted on the basis of its total phenolic content, and does not necessarily correlate with highamounts of phenolics. That is why both phenolic content and antioxidant activity information must bediscussed when evaluating the antioxidant potential of extracts [164].Scavenging of free radicals and inhibition of lipoxygenase are important target in the treatmentof a variety of inflammatory diseases. Inhibition rate of 5-lipoxygenase is used as an indicator ofMolecules 2017, 22, 290 15 of 50anti-inflammatory activity, resulting in the inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis [11].The study on the CN of Turkish origin included the EO and its major component PUL, which weretested for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity against standard active substances. The oildemonstrated inhibition on lipoxygenase at IC50 = 69.6 µg·mL−1, whereas its main componentPUL showed no effect at the same tested concentration. Neither the EO nor PUL displayedradical scavenging activity (>0.5 mg·mL−1). Major component PUL showed no inhibitory effecton lipoxygenase activity, but other components despite of their low concentration demonstrated aninhibitory effect on lipoxygenase activity in 1/29 ratio when compared to the standard substance [11].Another study on the material with the same origin comprised the antioxidant activity carried outusing the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. The IC50 values of the methanol, ethanol andpetroleum ether extracts were found to be 4.78± 0.2, 10.19± 0.1 and 63.5± 1.25 µg·mL−1, respectively.The amount of total phenol was examined using the Folin-Ciocaltaeu method and it was found thatthe ethanol extract had the highest amount (187.33 mg GA·gr−1). Using the Aluminium Chloride(AlCl3) Colorimetric Method, it was determined that the methanol extract contained the highestconcentration of flavonoid (21.7 mg catachol·gr−1) [148]. Investigating protective role of EO of TurkishCN against the oxidative stress of aflatoxin B1 in vitro, the oxidative status was assessed by measuringfollowing oxidative stress markers: super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) andmalondialdehyde (MDA). Major components of this oil were cis-piperitone epoxide, piperitenoneoxide, limonene and terpinen-4-ol. It was observed that EO suppressed the mutagenic effects ofaflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and modulated the adverse effects of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The results have clearlyshown that the oil has strong antioxidative effect probably related to its action on the enzymaticactivation system, and resulting from the role of cis-piperitone epoxide, piperitenone oxide andlimonene compounds [60].In vitro antioxidant activity of the ethanol extracts obtained from 21 aromatic plants from Greecebelonging to the Lamiaceae family was investigated. Among them, that of CN exhibited the sameactivity as α-tocopherol [82].Croatian material was assessed by DPPH scavenging activity and total antioxidant capacityassays, in comparison with hydroxycinnamic acids and trolox [165]. The total antioxidant capacitywas 650.65 mg TE·g−1. Different extracts of Croatian origin have also been analyzed by four methods:DDPH, ABTS (2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), reducing power and OxygenRadical Absorption Capacity (ORAC) [17]. All examined extracts showed potent antioxidant activityreducing different radicals. Waste water after hydrodistillation revealed the highest activity. Accordingto the authors, it was probably due the high content of phenolic compounds determined in this sample.This result is in agreement with that found for two studied calamint species which showeddifferent polyphenolic content and sterol composition [54]. The study on C. grandiflora indicated twicethe polyphenolic content of CN, while the latter contained a higher number of sterols. Among them,stigmast-5-en-3β-ol was found to be the major constituent, and the methanolic extract of C. grandiflorawas more potent than CN in a DPPH assay, while the activity of the C. grandiflora EtOAc fraction wasweaker than its CN counterpart. Fractions of CN showed higher activity using a β-carotene bleachingtest, and the petrol ether fraction of C. grandiflora showed significant inhibition of NO production. It isknown that typical phenolics that possess antioxidant activity are phenolic acids that are found inthis sample.However, a weak antioxidant activity (EC50 = 410.7 µL) was detected for Italian plant material:neither the oil nor PUL, its main compound, displayed radical scavenging activity (more than0.5 mg·mL−1). According to the authors, the EO of this species seems to have no environmentalrole [24]. CN hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared with ultrasound-assisted maceration from aerialparts of the plant collected in Italy during its different ontogenic growth stage (January, April, July andOctober). In this way, the authors explored phenophase influence on its polyphenol content, but thepotential chemopreventive efficacy of the investigated extracts in terms of their antioxidant, cytotoxic,cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities were also assessed through an extensive biologicalMolecules 2017, 22, 290 16 of 50screening. Each sample was analyzed for its phenol contents through Liquid Chromatography-DiodeArray Detector-Electrospray Ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS) techniques,highlighting CN as a rich source of polyphenol compounds. Acacetin and caffeic acid derivativeswere the main constituents and the relative abundance of each identified metabolite seemed to bestrongly collection time dependent. The evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of the investigatedhydroalcoholic extracts was carried out performing different tests, and Relative Antioxidant CapacityIndex (RACI) was calculated as well. The extract from the summer collection exerted the highestantioxidant capability in cell-free systems, whereas that from winter collection was capable of exertingimportant cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Comparing phenol profiling data to bioactivityones, it was highlighted that the winter extract contained an amount of acacetin and its derivativesnearly four times than those of caffeic acid derivatives [5].Antioxidant activity of CN from Portugal was determined by three methods: DPPH,β-carotene/linoleic acid and reducing power assay, and the results obtained suggested the promisinguse of its EO and extracts as food supplement and pharmaceutical formulations [166].The oil from Algerian material obtained by hydrodistillation was also evaluated by DPPH freeradical-scavenging and reducing power. For both tests, the oil showed a low activity, which wasless efficient than those of BHT and BHA. The authors explained it by its poor amount of phenoliccomponents [97]. Another analysis also included the material from Algeria but the assessment in vitroof some extracts. The results showed that the aqueous extract exhibited good antioxidant activitywith 90% inhibition rate at 4.62 mg·mL−1 by the DPPH method. The methanol extract showed thegreatest capability in reducing power. However, this activity is lower in regard to ascorbic acid as apositive control [167]. The material of the same origin was also analyzed, but in terms of potentialanti-inflammatory activity and the correlation of this effect with the plant’s potential antioxidantactivity [53]. Methanolic extract exhibited the moderate inhibitory activity in the paw oedema inducedby carrageenan (49% at 3 h), and had no effect on the TPA-induced ear oedema in mice. The antioxidantcapacity of an extract largely depends on its composition and the conditions of the testing systemused, and because many factors play a role, the effect of the extract cannot be wholly described withone single method. Total content in flavonoids and phenols of the extract was determined as 65.9and 789 µg·mg−1, respectively. The scavenging properties of the extracts were measured in terms oftheir ability to bleach the stable DPPH and ABTS + radicals and galvinoxyl, with the activity valuesexpressed as Trolox equivalents in the extract: 140, 537 and 313 µg·mg−1, respectively. The FRAP assay,which measures the antioxidant effect of a given substance in the reaction medium as reducing ability,was also performed. Activity values for this assay were expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents in theextract: 1227 µg·mg−1. The scavenger properties of the extracts against the superoxide anion andperoxynitrite were also determined: 6893 and 12.5 µg·mg−1. Finally, the lipid peroxidation of humanplasma by the extract was evaluated with the aid of non-enzymatic generation systems. The extractwas found to inhibit lipid peroxidation in human plasma, with inhibition value percentages greaterthan 80%.The antioxidant activity of the samples collected in North Morocco has been tested by three mostcommonly used methods: DPPH, reducing power and β-carotene bleaching assay [95]. Comparedto BHT, as a standard synthetic antioxidant, the oil showed relatively weak inhibiting activity in allthe tests used. According to the authors, the poor activity of EOCN might be attributed to the lack ofphenolic compounds, and to the high content of 1,8-cineole (42.94%), which has demonstrated poorability of inhibiting oxidation [168].Polyphenolic compounds, such as caffeic, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids, have been identifiedfrom the aerial part of this plant [169]. Acacetin glycosides, together with linarin, have been reportedas possible taxonomic markers in Calamintha genus [14]. The methanol extract from Egyptian materialwas found to contain flavonoids, phenolic acids, catechic tannins and mucilage, but also comprisedtraces of monoterpenes, mainly 1,8-cineole, carvone and PUL, from the glandular trichomes of theleaves. The flavones acacetin and linarin, as well as the flavanones eriodictyol and eriocitrine were alsoMolecules 2017, 22, 290 17 of 50presented in the extract. Additionally, the extract exhibited significant DPPH free radical scavengingactivity. It inhibited DPPH formation by 50% at a concentration of 68.57 mg·mL−1 (IC50) [170]. It isknown that flavones, together with catechins, are among the most powerful flavonoids for protectingthe body against reactive oxygen species and in the literature there are several reports that relate thebiological activities of these compounds to their antioxidant effect [171].Antioxidant activity of the plant extract from Iranian material was evaluated by Ferric ReducingAntioxidant Power (FRAP) and Total Phenolic Content (TPC) assays. The resulting TPC value was0.75± 0.01 mg·g−1 indicating that the examined plant extract had significantly high content of phenoliccompounds. The results also showed a considerable antioxidant activity and a high reducing power.In addition, a zymogram assay of peroxidase (POX) was performed to observe its activity. POX activitywas observed as a brown color band and two separate bands were also observed, indicating at leasttwo isoenzymes for POX [172].8. Insecticidal Activity of EOCNPlant insecticides have been used to fight pests for centuries. For instance, the use of plant extractsand powdered plant parts as insecticides was widespread during the Roman Empire. However,after the Second World War the few plants and plant extracts that had shown promising effects andwere of widespread use were replaced by synthetic chemical insecticides. Later on, adverse effectsof chemical insecticides became more evident with the appearance of problems like environmentalcontamination, residues in food and feed and pest resistance. Since the majority of plant insecticidesare biodegradable, this has led to a revival of growing interest in the use of either plant extracts orEOs. More than 1500 plant species have been reported to have insecticidal value [40]. Many plantsecondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, monoterpenoids or phenylpropanoids are toxic to insects;in addition, EOs extracted from plants have been widely investigated for pest control properties,with some demonstrating to be toxic [173].Nineteen EOs from the island of Corsica (including CN) have been tested as potential repellentsagainst mosquito Aedes aegypti. Space repellent properties were evaluated not highlighting the effect ofCN as the promising one. Additionally, olfactory studies have been carried out on human volunteersshowing great differences on a hedonic dimension and on the acceptance of these oils as fragrances fora repellent product. EOCN gave promising scores for both criteria. In addition to the repellent studyand the olfactory tests, thermogravimetric analysis has been performed and CN was the most stable,with 61% weight loss at 33 ◦C over 24 h [174].The Montenegran EOCN rich in monoterpene alcohol carvacrol showed strong insecticidal andfumigant activities against Tribolium castaneum adults [88]. Also, mortality rate of adult insects wastested: 56.67% of the insects died after 24 h, 83.33% after 48 h, while after 96 h the oil showedgreatest toxicity and caused the death of 96.67%. Carvacrol has already been reported to havebroad insecticidal and acaricidal activity against agriculture, stored products and medical pests,and it also acts as a fumigant [175–178]. Its insecticidal activity was also confirmed on the winefly (Drosophila melanogaster), showing that carvacrol had a stronger activity than thymol, and thatin combination with thymol, its insecticidal potential decreases. It could indicate that either otherconstituents are responsible for their toxicity, or that synergistic and/or antagonistic phenomena exist,and they alter the toxicity of the whole EO [179].The potential toxic effects of three EOs (including EOCN) on adults and larvae of Apis melliferawere also studied. The LD50 of the EO on adult bees showed “virtually no-toxicity”. The in vivo assayof larval toxicity showed that CN was not toxic to larvae [180].9. Phytotoxic Potential of CNTerpenes play many ecological roles, such as the attraction of pollinating insects, the defenseagainst herbivores and pathogens, and are also involved in plant-plant communication [181].Their phytotoxic activity was widely demonstrated [182–184]. The individual and/or combinedMolecules 2017, 22, 290 18 of 50effects of the pure terpenoids found in CN methanolic extract and EOs were evaluated in in vitrobioassays, at different combinations and concentrations, on seed germination and seedling growthof Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. To assess their potential phytotoxicity and their joint activity.None of the terpenes, singularly or in combination, was able to inhibit the germination process.Farnesene and trans-caryophyllene caused a strong inhibitory effect on root growth, and PUL, at thehighest concentrations, caused a reduction on lateral root formation. Although the mixture ofcamphor−trans-caryophyllene, with or without farnesene, did not cause any effects on root growth,the addition of PUL induced a marked synergistic activity. Moreover, the addition of farnesene,at low concentration, to PUL−camphor−trans-caryophyllene mixture further increased the inhibitoryeffect on root elongation [185]. The results confirm that allelopathic effects are generally due to theinteraction of a wide variety of molecules released by plants into the environment, and that the effectsobserved in nature cannot be always related to a single compound. Furthermore, the results suggestthat the cooperative action among the compounds, in a natural community or in field, could reducethe threshold concentration needed to cause the phytotoxic effect, as observed with farnesene addition.The phytotoxic activity of foliar volatiles of CN was assayed on germination and root growth ofLactuca sativa L. Moreover, the EOs extracted from the flowering plants were assayed on root growth oftwo crops, lettuce and radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and two of the most common weeds—Lolium perenneL. and Amaranthus retroflexus L.Foliar volatiles strongly inhibited both germination and root growth of lettuce, and its EOs,especially at the higher concentrations (125, 250 and 500 µL·L−1), inhibited both processes in lettuce,radish and A. retroflexus L. species while concurrently displaying little effect on L. perenne L. This effectappears to be important considering the potential use of EOCN or some of its constituents as a sourceof novel bioherbicides for weed management. Finally, the presence of bioactive terpenoids in leafsurface area and in EOs could suggest a potential role for this compound in CN establishment andproliferation in mediterranean habitats [77].Another study included 17 wild plants from the Mediterranean area (also collected in Calabria)that were assayed for their allelopathic activity on Lactuca sativa L. and as a potential source of newnatural herbicides for weed control. The aqueous extracts of shoots were assessed for their effects onseed germination and root growth of lettuce. Furthermore, to understand whether the most phytotoxicspecies could be a source of molecules for weed management, three different experiments wereconducted to: (i) determine the persistence of their phytotoxicity during storage period; (ii) determinethe phytotoxic potential of their decaying residues in pots against test species and (iii) evaluate theireffects against on Chenopodium album L., Sinapis alba L. and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv weeds.The aqueous extract of CN drastically inhibited seed germination and root elongation of lettuceand weed species with E. crus-galli being the most tolerant one. The authors marked it as a promisingsource of bio-herbicides. Its allelopathic potential and the efficacy as a source of natural compoundswere also confirmed in pot culture by adding the residues to soil mixture (simulating the fieldconditions) what resulted in reducing the shoot growth less than root growth of lettuce [186].The bio-guided fractionation method was employed to isolate and identify some compounds,prerequisite for the possible future use of CN in weed management [187]. Leaves and stems wereextracted with methanol and fractionated using n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol,solvents with different polarity. The potential phytotoxicity of the methanolic extract and its fractions,evaluated by ED50 (effective dose) value comparison, were assayed in vitro on seed germinationand root growth of lettuce. Germination and root growth of lettuce were strongly inhibited bycatmint methanolic extract and its fractions, showing the following hierarchy of phytotoxicity for bothphysiological processes: ethyl acetate≥ n-hexane > chloroform≥ n-butanol. In the most active fraction,analyzed by HPLC, five polyphenols, gallic, vanillic, syringic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids, wereidentified and quantified. The n-hexane fraction was a mixture of 32 chemicals, mainly composed ofterpenoids and fatty acids, as analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Further,GC analysis allowed quantification of five compounds: camphor, trans-caryophyllene, menthol,Molecules 2017, 22, 290 19 of 50farnesene and pulegone. Furthermore, both fractions inhibited seed germination and root growthof two of the most common and noxious weeds in agriculture fields, Amaranthus retroflexus andEchinochloa crus-galli [188–190]. The results confirmed the phytotoxic activity of CN due to thepresence of different molecule classes with biological activity and their potential future application asbio-herbicides [187].The oil from the aerial parts collected in Italian Salerno during full blooming period wasevaluated for its in vitro potential phytotoxic activity against germination and initial radical growth ofRaphanus sativus L. and Lepidium sativum L., two species frequently utilized in biological assays, andthree weed species Sinapis arvensis L., Triticum durum L. and Phalaris canariensis L. The oils seemed tobe ineffective against germination and radical elongation of the five tested seeds. At the highest dosestested, the oil showed stimulatory activity of germination of garden cress (L. sativum L.) [24].10. Anti-Ulcer Potential of CNGastric hyperacidity and ulcers are very common nowadays. It represents an imbalancebetween damaging factors within the lumen and protective mechanisms within the gastro duodenalmucosa [191]. The etiology of ulcer is not clear, and although prolonged anxiety, emotional stress,hemorrhagic surgical shock, burns and trauma are known to cause gastric irritation, the mechanismis very poorly understood [192]. Recently the involvement of neural mechanism in the regulationof stress responsiveness and complex neurotransmitter interactions were reported to cause gastriculceration [193].The treatment and prevention of these acid-related disorders are accomplished either bydecreasing the level of gastric acidity or by enhancing mucosal protection [191]. In folk medicine,an infusion of CN leaves is employed to treat gastrointestinal diseases [61], and its eupeptic andcarminative effects improve digestion [62]. Also, the herbs with high PUL content have been used ascomponents of herbal teas for stomach disorders [194,195].Determination of anti-ulcer potential of the material from India was undertaken [43]. Effect ofvarious doses (0.4 and 0.8 mL·kg−1) of the oil was studied on gastric ulcers in pylorus ligation andDiclofenac sodium induced gastric mucosal injury in rats. Anti-ulcer activity was evaluated bymeasuring the ulcer index, gastric content, total acidity, and the pH of gastric fluid. It was noticed thatthe oil dose dependently decreased gastric content, total acidity, ulcer index and increased the pH ofgastric fluid in pylorus ligation ulcer model. In Diclofenac sodium induced ulcer models, all oil dosesdecreased the ulcer index and increased the pH gastric fluid. These results supported the ethnomedicaluses of oil of this plant in the treatment of gastric ulcer.The gastroprotective activity of the methanolic extract was investigated using ethanol-inducedulcer in rats, with sucralfate as a reference drug. Samples of gastric mucosa, stained by PAS andhaematoxylin/eosin, were observed by light microscopy. The significant results were obtained evenafter oral administration of the crude methanol extract of leaves, suggesting that this plant is able topreserve mucosal integrity against ethanol-induced gastric diseases. The efficacy of the extract wascomparable to that of the reference drug. Moreover, oral treatment with gastroprotective doses of theextract did not affect either mice spontaneous locomotor activity or the behavioural and physiologicalfunctions. The authors concluded that the gastroprotective effect probably depended on a synergisticaction of all the compounds occurring in leaves, even if the antioxidant potential of the leaves playedan important role by removing damaging agents from the gastric mucosa [170]. The effect could beattributed, at least in part, to the presence of the flavonoids and polyphenols. The analysis of themethanol extract showed the presence of catechic tannins. Condensed tannins are able to protectthe gastric mucosa by the inhibition of histidine decarboxylase and the resulting decreased synthesisof histamine [196]. The mucus accumulation, observed in the gastric mucosa of rats treated withthe extract, could be related to a possible reaction between tannins and mucopolysaccharides [197].Additionally, it is possible that the gastroprotective effect of the methanol extract was due, at least partly,to the presence of terpenes which were associated with antiulcerogenic activity in other plants [198,199].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 20 of 50After treatment with the extract, ethanol failed to damage the gastric mucosa of experimental rats.Light microscopy observations of the gastric mucosa of the treated rats showed an increase of themucus layer, a normal straightness of the glands and a lower expansion of the glandular lumen andthe vessels, compared with the control rats. Several pathways can be involved in this effect but theprotective action of the methanol extract probably depends on an increase of mucosal barrier defenseand the removal of damaging factors. The radical scavenger activity of polyphenols could be a moreimportant mechanism, but the capacity of flavonoids to regulate the microcirculation may be anotherprotective factor. Moreover, literature data report that flavonoids that have at least four hydroxylgroups and are of catechol-type in particular, as eriodictyol and its derivatives, can inhibit gastric H+,K+ ATPase, a proton pump that plays a pivotal role in acid secretion [200].11. Additional Bioactivities of CNThe effect on the isolated rat ileum was also analyzed [28]. The material was collected inMontenegro and exerted significant spasmolytic effects which may underline the therapeutic actionof the plant. The oil inhibited spontaneous contraction of the ileum, reaching its maximum effect atthe concentration of 1 mg·mL−1 (EC50 value was 210.48 ± 9.12 µg·mL−1). The effect was reversibleafter washing, suggesting that the inhibition was not due to the damage of the intestine by the oil.In addition, PUL, the principal component in the oil, was analyzed as well.Contractions of smooth muscles depend on Ca2+ influx from extracellular space through calciumchannels, and it is well-known that the increase in external K+ concentration induces smooth musclecontractions through the activation of voltage operated calcium channels and subsequent calciumrelease from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [201,202]. The authors explained that the activity was probablycaused by the inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, which wasconfirmed by inhibition of K+ induced contractions with the oil (EC50 of 88.81 ± 6.01 µg·mL−1).The oil decreased the Ca2+ dose-response curves (EC50 of 18.18 ± 1.87 mmol·L−1), similar to thatcaused by verapamil (as the reference). PUL also exerted concentration dependent inhibition ofspontaneous contraction of the ileum and the effect was 23 times as potent as the oil in inhibitingcontractions. Accordingly, PUL may have a main role in spasmolytic activities of the plant [28].Both the cytotoxicity and anti-cytotoxicity of the extracts from Turkey were evaluated ona non-cancerous cell line (L929) [203]. It was shown that water, n-BuOH and MeOH extracts have weakcytotoxic effects (500–1000 µg·mL−1) against cells tested. However, EtOAc and DCM fractions havesignificant cytotoxic effects with the IC50 values of 58.9 and 77.1 µg·mL−1, respectively. On the otherhand, none of tested extracts recovered cytotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) at anyconcentration. The authors concluded that CN had no significant cell damage protective compoundsbut included some cytotoxic compound, recommending to be careful with their pharmacological usage.Neutrophils are constitutively programmed to die by apoptosis, leading to phagocytic clearance ofintact senescent cells by macrophages. For this reason, neutrophil elimination through apoptosis is ofconsiderable interest as a mechanism for promoting the resolution of acute inflammation and avoidinga persistent inflammatory response. Moreover, reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils, suchas the superoxide anion, peroxynitrite anion and the hydroxyl radical, are responsible for tissue injuryin many cases [204]. Potential anti-inflammatory activity of CN extract along with its apoptotic effecton the pro-inflammatory cells was analyzed [53]. As a result, no cytotoxic activity was detected at theselected concentrations.The material from Turkey was assessed in terms of antigenotoxic activity against aflatoxin B1 [60].It was evaluated by sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronucleus (MN) tests and it wasobserved that EO suppressed the mutagenic effects of aflatoxin B1. According to the authors, the activitycan be attributed to the EO composition, and high cis-piperitone epoxide (48.66%), piperitenone oxide(22.08%) and limonene (13.51%) levels. Anti-genotoxicity mechanisms of terpenes are associatedwith their antioxidant capacity [205,206]. Therefore, in addition to the previous study, super oxidedismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levelsMolecules 2017, 22, 290 21 of 50were measured to determine the antioxidant effect. EO was observed to modulate the adverse effectsof aflatoxin B1. The alfatoxin B1 treatment caused a decrease in SOD and GPx activities, but an increaseof MDA level, while its effects on enzymes were decreased after treatment with the oil. The resultsclearly showed strong antioxidative and anti-genotoxic effects, which were probably related to theEO’s action on the enzymatic activation system, and resulting from the role of cis-piperitone epoxide,piperitenone oxide and limonene compounds [60].The hypoglycemic effect in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was alsoinvestigated [207]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a water extract fromthe aerial parts, after either a single dose or daily oral administration for 15 days on plasma bloodglucose concentrations and basal insulin levels in normal and streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabeticrats. The results clearly demonstrated the hypoglycemic effect of this plant extract in both normal andSTZ diabetic rats. In addition, no changes were observed in basal plasma insulin concentrations aftertreatment with this plant in normal or STZ diabetic rats, indicating that the underlying mechanism ofthe plant's pharmacological action seems to be independent of insulin secretion.The detailed analysis of different biological activities was done with Egyptian material [65].The plant was found to present a very low toxicity both in vivo (LD50 of more than 100 mg·kg−1)and in vitro in the Artemia salina test (LD50 more than 500 µL·mL−1). The treatment with EO, in theIrwin test, showed a significant alteration in behavior, exhibiting typical effects of nonselective centralnervous system (CNS)-depressant drugs; it potentiates the hypnotic effects of sodium pentobarbital,decreasing the induction time and enhancing the sleeping time, versus the control group treated withpentobarbital. Moreover, it produces a decrease in body temperature, which is not surprising as it isknown that psychoactive CNS-depressant drugs reduce the body temperature [208]. The systemicadministration of EO produced a protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions. The plantgave protection against generalized tonic-clonic seizures induced by PTZ, by increasing the latencyperiod, by reducing the number of animals that exhibited convulsions, by diminishing the duration ofconvulsions, and by decreasing mortality to 67% at the dose of 100 mg·kg−1 [65].Numerous aromatic plants are recognized as active in the CNS, and they have at least ahypothetical potential to affect chronic conditions, such as headaches, anxiety, depression, or epilepsy,that do not respond well to conventional treatments. Inhalation of EOs or their volatile terpenes has asignificant role in controlling the CNS [209–211]. The oil compounds are lipophilic molecules, able topass rapidly through the blood–brain barrier and to penetrate into the CNS, revealing a sedativeeffect [212,213]. According to some literature data [29,111], the components responsible for theseactivities appeared be the major monoterpenes: PUL, menthone and 1,8-cineole. Carvone reduceslocomotor activity in the mouse, increases the latency period of PTZ-induced seizures, and potentiatespentobarbital-induced sleeping time [213,214]. The depressant effects of the oil analyzed could berelated to its main component carvone, but it cannot be excluded that other constituents could act insynergy with carvone [65].Investigation of antidiabetic activity of crude extracts and pure compounds from the aerial partswas undertaken [112]. The aqueous extract showed the promising antidiabetic activity. Based onthis finding, it was fractionated giving two known hydroxycinnamic acids: rosamarinic and caffeic.Both acids exhibited significant activity, even more than the positive control, glibenclamide.Antiproliferative activity of the plant extract from Iranian material was examined on humanbreast cancer cell line (MCF-7) using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide(MTT) method. The results showed a reasonable antiproliferative role played by the extract, indicatingthat this plant can be regarded as a suitable candidate for designing anticancer pharmaceuticalpreparations [172].The ethanolic extract of CN growing wild in Croatia was tested for its inhibitory activity againstAChE at concentrations of 0.25, 0.50 and 1 mg·mL−1 by in vitro Ellman’s method. The highestconcentration demonstrated moderate inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner with the IC50value of 16.45 µg·mL−1 [165].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 22 of 5012. Pulegone—The Main EOCN Chemical Compound(R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methylethylidine) cyclohexanone is a monoterpene ketone, known as PUL,found mainly in the Lamiaceae oils. It was first isolated from the oil of Mentha pulegium L. (pennyroyal,eng.) from which its name is derived. It has a pleasant, refreshing odor which can be described asmidway between peppermint and camphor [194].PUL is practically insolubile in water but miscible with ethanol, diethyl ether and chloroform.Two enantiomers occur in nature, the R-(+)-form being the most abundant in the EOs [215,216].Biogenetically, PUL is derived from terpinolene through piperitenone. It is also the precursor ofmenthone, isomenthone and isopulegone (Scheme 1). It is generally encountered in combination withone or more of the above mentioned compounds or its immediate precursor piperitenone [87].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 22 of 49  Scheme 1. Biosynthetic pathway for PUL and its reduced forms [217]. This colourless oily liquid at room temperature with a strong pungent aromatic mint smell (C10H16O, molecular weight 152.23) has a density of 0.9346 g·cm−3. PUL has a vapor pressure of 138 mm Hg, a specific gravity of 0.937 at 25 °C. Its boiling point is 224 °C and it freezes at less than 25 °C. It is a flammable liquid (flash point of 82 °C) that will ignite if moderately heated.  PUL is considered as one of the major common constituents of EOCN [11,33,34,42,44,48,51,55,57,70,77], where it can account for up to 85% [76]. Along with menthone, it represents the most frequent chemotype in the oils of this species, with clear difference in their ratio depending of plant’s phenophase stage. The initial process consists of PUL formation which is later (at the reproductive period) reduced in menthone. A slight difference in the relative ratio of PUL and menthone during and after the flowering stage of the plant was briefly reported [218], followed by more detailed studies [34,44]. The percentage of PUL was shown to be decreasing at the flowering period, while the content of menthone increased, leading to compositions in which the percentage of menthone was sometimes higher than that of PUL. This has been confirmed later in several studies [35,76]. This evolution of oil composition with the vegetative state seems to follow the one reported for Mentha x piperita L. [219]. The influence of seasonality on the PUL content in the EO of Mentha pulegium L. with a 54% reduction in its concentration during the winter has been also demonstrated [220]. PUL is the precursor for the formation of the stereoisomers of menthone, and this transformation leads to the reduction in PUL content of EOs. Variations in the compositions of EOs and PUL content depending on location, time of collection, and the stress to which the plant is exposed, among other factors, have also been explained [121]. Developmental and environmental factors are known to greatly influence the yield and composition of peppermint oil: the oil yield and menthol content increase with leaf (and thus oil gland) maturity, and a range of stress conditions (related to light, temperature and moisture status) tend to promote the accumulation of PUL and menthofuran [221]. PUL has been given Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the United States Food and Drug administration since 1965. It is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food use (21 CFR 172.515) and was included by the Council of Europe in 1974 in the list of artificial flavoring substances that may be added temporarily to foodstuffs without hazard to public health [194]. Therefore, it is widely used in flavouring agents, perfumery and aromatherapy.

Biosynthetic pathway for PUL and its reduced forms [217].This colourless oily liquid at room temperature with a strong pungent aromatic mint smell(C10H16O, molecular weight 152.23) has a density of 0.9346 g·cm−3. PUL has a vapor pressure of138 mm Hg, a specific gravity of 0.937 at 25 ◦C. Its boiling point is 224 ◦C and it freezes at less than25 ◦C. It is a flammable liquid (flash point of 82 ◦C) that will ignite if moderately heated.PUL is c nsidered as ne f e major common constituents of EOCN [11,33,34,42,44,48,51,55,57,70,77],where it can account for up to 85% [76]. Along with enthone, it represents the most frequentchemotype in the oils of this species, with clear difference in their ratio depending of plant’sphenophase stage. The initial process consists of PUL formation which is later (at the reproductiveperiod) reduced in menthone. A slight difference in the relative ratio of PUL and menthone duringand after the flowering stage f the plant was briefly reported [218], followed by more detailedstudies [34,44]. The percentage of PUL was shown to be decr asing at the flow ri g perio , while thecontent of menthone increased, leading to compositions in which the percentage of menthone wassometimes higher than that of PUL. This has been confirmed later in several studies [35,76].This evolution of oil composition with the vegetative state seems to follow the one reported forMentha x piperita L. [219]. The influence of seasonality on the PUL content in the EO of Mentha pulegiumL. with a 54% reduction in its concentration during th winter has been also demonst ated [220].

Developmental and environmental factors are known to greatly influencethe yield and composition of peppermint oil: the oil yield and menthol content increase with leaf (andthus oil gland) maturity, and a range of stress conditions (related to light, temperature and moisturestatus) tend to promote the accumulation of PUL and menthofuran [221].PUL has been given Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the United States Foodand Drug administration since 1965.

Limits in its use infood products have been issued for different applications, but there are currently no limits in the areaof medicinal products. Its concentration in cosmetic formulations should not exceed 1% [222].This oxygenated monoterpene exhibits a plenty of different biological activities suchas antimicrobial [57,223–229], antihistaminic [230], antipyretic [29], convulsant [231–233],hepatotoxic [234–239] and hypercholesterolemic [240] among others. Also, it inhibits cytochromeP-450 [241] and lysozymal enzyme activities [242]. Inhibitory effect on the contractile activity of theisolated intestine [28,230] and myometrium [243] was demonstrated. It is a potent abortifacient [244].PUL is reported to have anti-feedent, pesticidal and insect repellant properties [228,245–248].Antiparasitical and anti-potato-sprouting activities of the plants with PUL-rich EOs have beenreported [194,249]. Phytotoxic properties of PUL have been also analyzed [246,250]. Commercially, it isused as a flavoring agent for toothpastes and mouthwashes, and as a valuable ingredient for perfumesand various pharmaceuticals [228].13. Alternative Sources of PULPUL is naturally found in plants of the Lamiaceae family, and its amount in various oils variesdepending on several factors such as origin of the plant, yearly weather conditions, harvest date, plantage, fertilization, location, and planting time [215,251–254]. It is a major constituent of the volatileoils of European pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.) and American pennyroyal (Hedeoma pulegioides L.),where it comprises up to 97% and 82.3%, respectively [93,194,251,255–263]. High percentage hasalso been reported for some other mint species: 97.2% for M. rotundifolia (L.) Hudson [264], 86.2%for M. gentilis L. [265], 81.5% for M. arvensis L. [266], 78.4% for M. requienii Benth. [267] and 72.6%for M. longifolia (L.) Hudson [268,269]. It can be also found as a minor constituent in several otheredible Mentha species and their derived volatile oils, including peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) andspearmint (Mentha spicata L.) [239,270–277]. Other Hedeoma species can also be rich in PUL: 64.2% wasfound in H. mandoniana Wedd. [278] and 59.9% in H. drummondii Benth. [279].Beside CN, as herein reported in detail, PUL can also be an important constituent in the EOs ofsome other Calamintha species. For instance, C. sylvatica Bromf has been found to contain from 11.6 to54.5% of PUL [25,110,111], C. grandiflora (L.) Moench up to 35.2% [280,281], while the Turkish endemicC. pamphylica Boiss. et Heldr. contains up to 38% of PUL [194,282,283].The oils rich in PUL are also obtained from other Lamiaceae species. For instance, 97% of PULhas been found in the oil of Acinos majoranifolius (Mill.) Šilic´ from Montenegro [284]. Up to 96.9% ofPUL was reported for A. suaveolens (Sibt. et Smith) G. Don [285–288]. From this genus, A. arvensis(Lam.) Dandy (51.3%) [289] and A. rotundifolius Pers. (from 23.2% to 80.7%) [290,291] should be alsomentioned. Some Micromeria species have been reported as a rich source of PUL: 80% was foundin M. capitellata Benth. [292], up to 81% in different subspecies of M. fruticosa (L.) Druce [194,293]and 32.8% in M. thymifolia (Scop.) Fritsch [294]. The main EO constituent of Satureja brownei (SW.)Briq. from Venezuela [295] and S. odora (Gris.) Epl. from Argentina [296] was found out to be PUL(64.3% and 61.5%, respectively). Some other Satureja species also contain PUL: S. glabella (Michx.) Briq.(33.3%) and S. darwinii (Benth.) Briq. (11.4%) [297].Molecules 2017, 22, 290 24 of 50Cyclotrichium niveum (Boiss.) Manden. & Scheng. and C. origanifolium (Labill.) Manden. &Scheng. were found to contain up to 68% and 37% of PUL, respectively [23,298–301]. Up to 79.3% wasreported for several Minthostachys species: M. mollis Griseb. [302,303], M. andina (Brett) Epling [277],M. glabrescens (Benth.) Epling [304] and M. verticillata (Griseb.) Epling [305].The species from the genus Ziziphora are very rich in PUL content. 88% has been reported forZ. brevicalyx Juz. [306], 68% for Z. hispanica L. [307] and up to 65.2% for Z. bungeana Juz. [308,309].A review [194] of all the analyses performed on Turkish Ziziphora taxa [50,310,311] pointed out asignificant richness in PUL (up to 87%) in Z. tenuior L., Z. taurica Bieb. and Z. clinopodioides Lam.Some Hesperozygis species (H. marifolia (Schauer) Epling, H. ringens (Benth.) Epling and H. rhododonEpling) have been found to contain up to 40.75% of PUL [228,312]. Agastache genus should be alsomentioned, and some of its species have high amount of PUL: A. rugosa (Fisch. & Mey.) Kuntze,A. scrophulariifolia (Willd.) Kuntze and A. mexicana (Kunth) Lint & Epling contain 34%, 45.2% and75.3%, respectively [313–315].PUL-containing plant species have been also reported in some other families: Asteraceae [316–320],Cannabaceae [321], Apiaceae [322], Verbenaceae [323], Ericaceae [324], Rutaceae [325] and Myrtaceae [326].Even some invertebrate animals (Bryozoan Conopeum seurati) have been reported to contain PUL [194,327].Besides being available from natural sources, PUL can be also produced by chemical synthesis.A convenient synthesis of (−)-PUL from (−)-citronellol was demonstrated [328] (Scheme 2).The method included an ene cyclisation of (−)-citronellol under oxidative conditions: the treatmentof (−)-citronellol with 2.5 equiv. of pyridininum chlorochromate (PCC) in dry methylene chloridegave iso-pulegone in one step via the intermediates citronellal and the iso-pulegols. Basic treatmentof iso-pulegone with ethanolic sodium hydroxide gave (−)-PUL in 70% overall yield (Scheme 2).However, traditional PCC oxidation was found to be environmentally unfriendly and inconsistentresults were obtained. Therefore, a mild organic oxidant (IBX) has been proposed to replace highlytoxic PCC for the synthesis of chiral PUL [329]. The same method was reported by others [330], but theene cyclisation of citronellal to iso-pulegol was achived by using catalytic ZnCl2.Molecules 2017, 22, 290 24 of 49 PUL-containing plant species have been also reported in some other families: Asteraceae [316–320], Cannabaceae [321], Apiaceae [322], Verbenaceae [323], Ericaceae [324], Rutaceae [325] and Myrtaceae [326]. Even some invertebrate animals (Bryozoan Conopeum seurati) have been reported to contain PUL [194,327]. Besides being available from natural sources, PUL can be also produced by chemical synthesis. A convenient synth sis of (−)-PUL from (−)-citronellol was demonstrated [328] (Scheme 2). The method included an ene cyclisation of (−)-citronellol under oxidative conditions: the treatment of (−)-citronellol with 2.5 equiv. of pyridininum chlorochromate (PCC) in dry methylene chloride gave iso-pulegone in one step via the intermediates citronellal and the iso-pulegols. Basic treatment of iso-pulegone with ethanolic sodium hydroxide gave (−)-PUL in 70% overall yield (Scheme 2). However, traditional PCC oxidation was found to be env ronmentally unfriendly and i consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a mild organic oxidant (IBX) has been proposed to replace highly toxic PCC for the synthesis of chiral PUL [329]. The same method was reported by others [330], but the ene cyclisation of citronellal to iso-pulegol was achived by using catalytic ZnCl2.   Scheme 2. Cyclisation of (−)-citronellol to (−)-PUL. With another synthetic procedure (±)-PUL can be obtained from 3-methylcyclohexanone [331]. First, the oxo-ester obtained from 3-methylcyclohexanone via the glyoxilic ester was converted into the ketal, and by protecting the carbonyl group with a cyclic ketal, the β-oxo-ester can be simply converted into (±)-PUL. It has been also reported that piperitenone could be enantioselectively hydrogenated to give  (+)-PUL using chiral metal catalysts such as Rh complex with cyclohexylanisylmethylphosphine [332–334] or diphenylphosphine as the ligand [335], or Co complex with diphenylneomethylphosphine as the ligand [334]. Others have demonstrated the synthesis of (−)-PUL from simple cyclohexenone [335]; with the advantage of highly enantioselective conjugate addition of lithium cuprates to α,β-unsaturated ketone in the presence of pivaloylamidophosphine, (−)-PUL was obtained with 55% overall yield. 14. Toxicokinetic Studies on PUL and its Metabolic Pathways Several toxicity studies of PUL and pennyroyal EO were performed. Acute lethal doses are available for PUL. The subcutaneous LD50 has been estimated as 1.709 mg·kg−1 in mice, the intraperitoneal LD50 as 150 mg·kg−1 in rats, and the intravenous LD50 as 330 mg·kg−1 in dogs [336]. Recently, the acute toxicity of the EO of Mentha longifolia (L.) Hudson in a rat model has been reported [337]. The noticeable signs of toxicity were observed when the oil was administered orally at doses greater than 100 mg·kg−1, with the LD50 value of 570 mg·kg−1. Abnormal gait, increased respiration, decreased activity and limb paralysis were found to be some of the clinical sings of PUL-mediated toxicity. Human ingestion of PUL (in pennyroyal oil) has been associated with toxic effects [338]. Moderate to severe toxicity from ingestion of at least 10 mL of pennyroyal oil was reported (coma, seizures and hepatic and renal effects as toxic symptoms), while less than 10 mL was generally associated with gastritis and mild central nervous system toxicity. However, the toxic effect was not always related strictly to dose and depended on the use of emetics or other treatments. For instance, coma and seizures associated with ingestion of 5 mL pennyroyal oil were also reported, as well as two other cases who survived after the ingestion of 30 mL [339]. This variability in the toxicity of pennyroyal oil may be due to its differing content of PUL [215]. EO of Mentha pulegium L. was suspected to be hepatotoxic, which was mainly related to PUL and its metabolites that are responsible for tissue necrosis [237,238]. Published animal toxicity studies have shown it to be primarily a hepatotoxicant and to a lesser extent a lung and kidney toxicant [234,235]. Scheme 2. Cyclisation of (−)-citronellol to (−)-PUL.With another synthetic procedure (±)-PUL can be obtained from 3-methylcyclohexanone [331].First, the oxo-ester obtained from 3-methylcyclohexanone via the glyoxilic ester was converted into theketal, and by protecting the carbonyl grou with a cyclic ketal, the β-oxo-ester can be simply convertedinto (±)-PUL.It has been also reported that piperitenone could be enantioselectively hydrogenated to give (+)-PULusing chiral metal catalysts such as Rh complex with cyclohexylanisylmethylphosphine [332–334] ordiphenylphosphine as the ligand [335], r Co complex with diph nylneomethy phosphine as theligand [334].

Recently, the acuteMolecules 2017, 22, 290 25 of 50toxicity of the EO of Mentha longifolia (L.) Hudson in a rat model has been reported [337]. The noticeablesigns of toxicity were observed when the oil was administered orally at doses greater than 100 mg·kg−1,with the LD50 value of 570 mg·kg−1. Abnormal gait, increased respiration, decreased activity andlimb paralysis were found to be some of the clinical sings of PUL-mediated toxicity. Human ingestionof PUL (in pennyroyal oil) has been associated with toxic effects [338]. Moderate to severe toxicityfrom ingestion of at least 10 mL of pennyroyal oil was reported (coma, seizures and hepatic and renaleffects as toxic symptoms), while less than 10 mL was generally associated with gastritis and mildcentral nervous system toxicity. However, the toxic effect was not always related strictly to dose anddepended on the use of emetics or other treatments. For instance, coma and seizures associated withingestion of 5 mL pennyroyal oil were also reported, as well as two other cases who survived after theingestion of 30 mL [339]. This variability in the toxicity of pennyroyal oil may be due to its differingcontent of PUL [215].EO of Mentha pulegium L. was suspected to be hepatotoxic, which was mainly related to PUL andits metabolites that are responsible for tissue necrosis [237,238]. Published animal toxicity studies haveshown it to be primarily a hepatotoxicant and to a lesser extent a lung and kidney toxicant [234,235].In humans, PUL (primarily from pennyroyal oil) has been associated with severe liver and kidneydamage [338,340,341]. PUL is considered toxic due to a hepatic metabolic activation of the P-450enzyme which liberates menthofuran [239]. According to others [244], it is metabolized to a series ofhepatotoxins that causes liver cancer, and can rapidly destroy liver [236].Toxicity studies in laboratory animals have mostly focused on its acute hepatotoxicity. However,pulmonary toxicity and cyst-like lesions in the brain have also been reported in mice and rats [235].It was demonstrated that hepatotoxicity involved metabolism of PUL to menthofuran and furthermetabolism to a reactive γ-ketoenal [342]. The potential for oxidation of menthofuran to a reactiveepoxide was also noticed [343,344], while other studies [345,346] detected potentially toxic p-cresol,a metabolite of menthofuran in the urine of PUL-treated rats. The covalent binding of 14C-PUL-derivedradioactivity has also been observed, as an evidence for the formation of reactive intermediates, in theliver, kidney and lung of mice receiving 280 mg·kg−1 i.p. (intraperitoneal) [347]. PUL has been shownto deplete glutathione in plasma and liver of rats, and hepatotoxicity was increased if glutathionesynthesis was inhibited with buthione-[S,R]-sulfoximine [236]. Mice receiving hepatotoxic doses ofPUL had decreased glutathione levels within 3 h, followed by a rapid rise in plasma glutamic-pyruvictransferase [234]. The presence of glutathione conjugates in bile and mercapturic acids in urine wasobserved [348].It has been noticed that i.p. administration of a single dose (250 mg·kg−1) of PUL torats caused marked decrease in microsomal cytochrome P-450, aminopyrine-N-demethylase andglucose-6-phosphatase activities, as well as a significant increase in serum glutamate pyruvatetransaminase (SGPT) level [349]. The authors also indicated the protective effect of phycocyanin, oneof the major biliproteins of blue-green algae Spirulina platensis, on this kind of mediated hepatotoxicity.In order to find out the effect of phycocyanin on the mode of metabolism of PUL, experiments werecarried out in vivo where urine samples collected from rats which where treated with PUL and ratswhich were treated with the combination of phycocyanin and PUL were analyzed. It was noticed thatthe level of menthofuran was significantly higher (nearly 70% more) in the urine samples collectedfrom rats treated only with PUL. However, there were only marginal changes in the levels of othermajor metabolites. This is a significant observation since mentofuran is considered as the proximatetoxin of PUL, responsible for at least half of the hepatocellular necrosis caused by PUL.PUL was found not to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535or TA1537 at different concentrations (from 6.4 to 800 mg per plate) with or without S9 metabolicactivation [350]. However, it was reported to be weakly genotoxic in Drosophila melanogaster at a doseof 0.2 mL, based on the presence of small single spots in the wing spot test [351], while the pennyroyaloil reported to contain 75.7% PUL was not mutagenic in the same assay at a dose of 2.1 mL.Molecules 2017, 22, 290 26 of 50PUL undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism with the primary metabolite beingmenthofuran [352]. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that PUL is metabolized by thecytochrome P-450 enzyme system [347,353,354], while some authors [355] determined human CYP2E1,CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 to be active in metabolism of PUL to menthofuran. Several studies havebeen published describing the metabolism of PUL in rodents [342,345,346,356–358] indicating thecomplexity of the metabolic profile with at least three pathways involving hydroxylation, reduction orconjugation. One of the pathways leads to the formation of menthofuran involving 9-hydroxylationwith a subsequent reduction of carbon-carbon double bond and furan ring formation. PUL canbe reduced to menthone and isomenthone, followed by hydroxylation in ring or side chain andsubsequent conjugation with glucuronic acid. The hydroxylation at C-5 or methyl (9- or 10-) tohydroxylated metabolites, followed by conjugation with glucuronic acid or glutathione can also takeplace. Then, formation of piperitenone after 5-hydroxylation is followed by dehydration; piperitenoneis further metabolized by ring and side-chain hydroxylations (4-, 5-, 7-, 10-positions). Mercapturic acidpathway metabolites were detected in bile in mice and both bile and urine in rats [348]. The studiesconducted at hepatotoxic doses (250 or 400 mg·kg−1) in male rats resulted in identification of14 phase I metabolites, most arising from a common 9-hydroxy-PUL intermediate [346,356], whileothers [357] identified 10 phase II metabolites consisting of glucuronide, glutathione and glutathionylglucuronide conjugates in the bile of Sprague-Dawley rats receiving 250 mg·kg−1 by i.p. injection.14 urinary metabolites of PUL in rats, mostly glucuronide conjugates, have also been indentified [358].In contrast to rats, a larger ratio of the 14C in female mouse urine consisted of specific glucuronideconjugates of the menthones. Mouse urine appeared to contain less of the glucuronide conjugateof 7α-hydroxymintlactone, derived from menthofuran. The authors did not report important sexdifferences in PUL metabolism.Disposition of 14C-PUL after a single oral dose of 0.8–80 mg·kg−1 in male and female F344 ratsand B6C3F1 mice have been investigated [348]. Mice excreted 85%–100% of the dose in 24 h, whilerats excreted only 59%–81% of the administered radioactivity in the same time, primarily in urine(44% to 93% of total dose) and feces (6% to 24%), with a trace in expired air. Some dose-, species-and sex-dependent differences in elimination of PUL-derived 14C were also observed. For instance,the proportion of 14C excreted in the urine in rats decreased with increased dose, and male rats excretedless 14C than the female ones. Overall, mice excreted more 14C in urine than rats, and the amountof 14C excretion was similar (males) or higher (females) with increased dose. The study includedthe investigation of accumulation in tissues. PUL-derived radioactivity was present in liver, kidney,blood and lungs for 24 h following oral administration. Tissue concentrations were found to be lowerin mice than in rats. The highest concentration of 14C in tissues of these animals was in the liver,a known target organ most closely associated with PUL toxicity [235]. Male rats tended to have highertissue concentrations (even up to 10-fold greater) than females, especially in the kidney. This sexdifference was not seen in mice. An additional study demonstrated binding of PUL and its metabolitesmenthofuran and menthone to α2u-globulin in the cytosol of male F344/N rat kidney following oraladministration of these 14C-labeled chemicals [359]. Binding of the 14C to α2u-globulin was foundto be reversible and did not result in accumulation of the protein in the kidney. Multidose studiesin female F344/N rats indicated a potential for bioaccumulation of PUL-derived radioactivity in theliver [348].Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies on PUL in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice have beenreported recently [339]. They deposited PUL dissolved in corn oil through a tube directly into thestomach to groups of 50 male and female rats and mice for up to two years. Male rats received 18.75,37.5 or 75 mg·kg−1 of PUL five times per week, while female rats and male and female mice received37.5, 75 or 150 mg·kg−1 five days per week. Control animals received corn oil with no chemical addedby the same method. As the result, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of PUL in malerats. Contrary to that, there was clear evidence of its carcinogenic activity in female rats based onincreased incidences of urinary bladder neoplasms, as well as in mice based on increased incidencesMolecules 2017, 22, 290 27 of 50of hepatocellular neoplasms (adenomas in both sexes, hepatoblastomas in males). Rare bone lesions,osteoma and osteosarcoma, in female mice may have been also related to PUL administration. A uniquekidney lesion, hyaline glomerulopathy, was observed in all dosed groups of mice (male and female)and in the groups of rats receiving the highest doses of PUL. The occurrence of some specificallylocalized nonneoplastic lesions (liver, nose, forestomach) was also associated with PUL administration.Antitumor ativity of EO from Agastache rugosa (Fisch. & Mey) Kuntze as well as PUL, the maincompound of this oil, using cell viability assay (MTT) have been evaluated [315]. The results showeda dose- and time-dependent increase of damage induced by all tested samples in gastric cancer cellline SGC-7901 with the inhibation rate of >85% for PUL at the concentrations ranging from 12.5 to100 µg·mL−1.15. Antimicrobial Activity of PULAs a part of many EOs, PUL has been reported to play an important role in their antimicrobialactivity. Antimicrobial activity of the EO of Mentha x villosa Hudson, as well as its major componentrotundifolone and four similar analogues (including PUL) against standard strains of S. aureus,P. aeruginosa, E. coli, C. albicans and one strain of meticilin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has beenevaluated [227]. PUL was found to possess good antibacterial activity against the strains of S. aureusand MRSA (11 and 12 mm of inhibition zone, respectively), as well as antifungal activity againstC. albicans (16 mm of inhibition zone), but no effect has been shown on the Gram(−) strains of E. coliand P. aeruginosa. According to others [360], PUL may be the most active antimicrobial componentin M. suaveolens Ehrh. Strong antibacterial activity of M. pulegium L. has been attributed to the highamount of PUL [122,361]. The great synergism between its oil and mild heat has been related to thehigh content of PUL, especially at 4 ◦C [119–122].Anti-dermatophyte activity against Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes of the EO ofMinthostachys mollis (Kunth) Griseb. was attributed to the presence of PUL as its main constituents [362].In another study, this EO was found to be more active against Gram(+) bacteria, and the authorsexplained that to some extent by the presence of PUL (44.5%) [363].PUL has been identified as a potent antimicrobial agent, particularly against all Salmonella species,showing inhibition halos varying ranging between 16 and 20 mm [57]. Its efficacy was maintainedup to a dose of 0.5 mL, remaining appreciable at 1.0 mL with an inhibition halo of 10 mm. Strongantifungal activity of EOCN against Fusarium and Aspergullus strains has also been attributed tothe high content of PUL [96]. PUL was found to strongly inhibite mycelial growth of A. flavus, andcomplete growth inhibition was observed at the concentration of 0.8 mg·mL−1 [229]. Other authorsalso pointed out the importance of PUL in antimicrobial effect of EOCN [55]. PUL, as the mainconstituent of the EO of Micromeria thymifolia (Scop.) Fritsch, was found to be responsible for itshigh antibacterial activity [226,294]. PUL isolated from M. cilicica Hausskn. ex P.H. Davis exhibitedsignificant antibacterial and antifungal activities, particularly against S. typhimurium, S. aureus andC. albicans [146]. The antibacterial activity of Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. EO may in part be associatedwith the presence of PUL as its main constituent [308].16. Spasmolytic and Gastrointestinal-Related Activities of PULMany plant preparations are used as spasmolytics for the gastro-intestinal tract and may also beused for other disorders such as indigestion or diarrhea [364]. According to some authors [194,195]many of PUL-rich plants (many Lamiaceae species, including CN) are used as components of herbalteas for stomach disorders in Turkey. EOs such as those of peppermint, dill and caraway are examplesof plant-derived spasmolytics [365]. It has been demonstrated that some monoterpenes also possessspasmolytic activity [366]. Investigating the correlation between structure and spasmolytic activityof rotundifolone and its analogues (including PUL) in ileum isolated from guinea-pig, the authorsfound that all monoterpenes tested were relaxants of intestinal smooth muscles. Comparison hasbeen made for the effects of rotundifolone (having both α,β-unsaturated keto and epoxy groups) withMolecules 2017, 22, 290 28 of 50PUL (having only a keto group) and limonene-oxide (having only an epoxy group), with the aimto find out possible influence of the presence of functional groups. As they concluded, both groupscontribute to the spasmolytic activity of rotundifolone, but their presence is not a critical requirement.In order to investigate whether the position of the groups in the molecule affects the spasmolyticactivity, rotundifolone was compared to pulegone oxide (the same positioned keto groups, but differfrom each other in the position of epoxy group) and to carvone epoxide (with different positioned ketogroups, but same epoxy group position). The results showed that the position of the functional groupsat the ring also influenced the spasmolytic activity. In addition, the study showed the influence ofchirality of the enantiomers on the pharmacological activity. Differently, the absence of the oxygenatedmolecular structure was not a critical requirement for the molecule to be bioactive.Spasmolytic activity of PUL in guinea pig ileum has been investigated [367]. Beside its relaxantmechanism, the study also tested the involvement of voltage-dependent calcium and potassiumchannels and muscarinic antagonism. PUL caused a shift in the calcium curve to the right, withreduction in the maximum effect, and the pretreatment with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA)partially inhibited relaxation produced by PUL. It also caused a shift in the bethanechol curve tothe right, with reduction in the maximum effect. The results obtained showed that the intestinalmuscle relaxation induced by PUL occurred via the partial blockade of Ca2+ channels, the activation ofK+ channels and noncompetitive antagonism of muscarinic receptors. PUL (0.15–50 µmol·L−1) wasalso found to inhibit the spontaneous (EC50 of 9.02 ± 0.08 µg·mL−1) and K+ induced contractions ofthe isolated rat ileum (EC50 of 4.05 ± 0.14 µg·mL−1) and to run the dose response curve of calciumrightward. According to the authors, PUL may have the main role in spasmolytic activities of CN [28].It exerted concentration dependent inhibition of spontaneous contraction of the ileum and the effectwas 23 times as potent as EOCN in inhibiting contractions.Modulation of the contraction of smooth muscle forms the therapeutic basis of several drugs,owing to the importance of smooth muscle function in most body organs, including airways, bloodvessels, uterus, and gastrointestinal tract [368]. The importance of evaluating natural productsthat have biological activity on smooth muscle lies in the fact that spasmolytic substances arelikely to have applications in the treatment of various diseases. This includes conditions suchas cerebral vasospasm, asthma, hypertension, and uterine and intestinal spasms, as well as otherpathophysiological processes that involve changes in the mechanisms of smooth muscle contractionand relaxation [369]. The vasorelaxant activity of PUL on the rat superior mesenteric artery wasinvestigated [370]. Compared with other structural analogues, it was found that the absence of anoxygenated molecular structure was not a critical requirement for the molecule to be bioactive, but theposition of ketone group in the p-menthone structure influenced the vasorelaxant potency and efficacy.The antidiarrheal properties of the EO of Mentha longifolia (L.) Hudson in a rat model have beeninvestigated [337]. The study revealed that EO possessed antidiarrheal activity, and according to theauthors, the presence of PUL in the essence could be attributed to the antidiarrheal activity of thewhole oil. This in vivo effects of the oil were consistent with the previous findings which indicateda reduction of total faeces weight and soft faeces frequency by PUL [371]. It was found that PUL wasable to reduce the normal and altered propulsive movement induced by castor oil. PUL was also testedon gastrointestinal motility by charcoal meal test. An insignificant increase in the intestinal motilitywas observed in 100 mg·kg−1 of PUL, suggesting a weak spasmolytic activity. This activity was reversedose dependent, with the greatest antispasmodic effect shown at 25 mg·kg−1 of PUL. It was moreeffective in the castor oil induced intestinal transit than in the normal transit, suggesting that PUL maybe more effective in an altered state than in normal state.The reduction in the intestinal motility may be responsible for the antidiarrheal activity. Probably,PUL at low doses increased the reabsorption of NaCl and water by decreasing intestinal motilityas observed by the decrease in intestinal transit by charcoal meal and by their anticholinergic andantihistaminic effects [230]. In the enteropooling assay, the maximal effect of PUL was similar toloperamide, one of the most efficacious and widely used antidiarrheal drugs. Loperamide effectivelyMolecules 2017, 22, 290 29 of 50antagonized diarrhea induced by castor oil [372]. The therapeutic effect of loperamide is believedto be due to its anti-motility and anti-secretory properties, and it is likely that PUL may mediate itseffects through similar mechanisms. According to the results, PUL has weak anti-motility and veryefficacious anti-secretory activity. Overall, these effects collectively may contribute to the appearanceof no antidiarrheal activity. An antimicrobial activity of the PUL against common pathogens involvedin gastroenteritis has been reported [373] and is likely to contribute to the antidiarrheal potency duringinfectious diarrhea.17. Insecticidal Propertis of PULMonoterpenoids have been considered as potential pest control agents because they are acutelytoxic to insects and possess repellent [374] and antifeedant properties [375]. Their evaluation on variousinsects have established their biological activity as ovicides, fumigants or contact toxicants [376,377].Acute toxicity of PUL to various insects was demonstrated [248], and according to some authors [351],it is the most powerful of three insecticides naturally occurring in many mint species. PUL has beenconsidered effective as a defensive chemical, in part because of its repellency [245], but also because itinterferes with insect feeding behavior, development, and reproduction [378]. Its use as a mosquitorepellent has been pointed out [379]. Its acute toxicity was evaluated against the diamondback moth,Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera), and the results showed moderate activity exhibiting less than 45%mortality in up to 15 µg/larva [380]. However, in biorational mixtures PUL was synergistic to boththymol and 1,8-cineole where the increase in activity was almost twofold. Notwithstanding theirindividual activities, linalool and PUL were also antagonistic in a mixture. Potential larvicidal activityagainst the western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera) and adulticidal activityagainst the house fly Musca domestica (Diptera) have been investigated [246]. Among 34 naturallyoccurring monoterpenoids tested, PUL was one of the most effective with LD50 values of 39 µg perfly and 38 µg per rootworm. Pyrethrins were used as a standard, and in comparasion with PULwere almost five times more toxic. A soil bioassay for the determination of larvicidal activity ofmonoterpenoids in soil against western corn rootworm larvae was performed as well. PUL was foundto possess moderate activity with LD50 value of 63 µg·g−1. In addition, the leaf-dip method was used todetermine acaricidal activity of monoterpenoids against the twospotted spider mite Tetranychtus urticae(Acari: Trombidiformes). Mild activity was shown by 30 monoterpenoids tested, with toxicitydiffering depending on concentrations and exposure times. PUL caused 100% mortality at the highestconcentration (10,000 pm) 24 h after treatment, but the lower concentrations showed no effect, or aslight effect was noticed after prolonged exposure time (10% mortality after 72 h for the concentrationof 1000 pm). In another study [381], a preliminary fumigation screening test was evaluated on someimportant stored-product pest insects: the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera), the red flour beetleTribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), the sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera),the house fly Musca domestica (Diptera) and the German cockroach Blattella germanica (Blattodea).Among twenty monoterpenoids tested, PUL was one of the highest activity causing 100% mortality inall five species tested at 50 µg·mL−1 air. In the fumigation assay, it was effective against T. castaneum;however the toxicity was relatively low in comparison to dichlorvos (used as a standard). The lowestLC50 value obtained for PUL was 0.2 µg·mL−1 at 37 ◦C and 96 h, while the corresponding treatmentwith dichlorvos had an LC50 value of 0.008 µg·mL−1. It was also found that the LC50 value tendedto decrease at longer exposure times and higher temperatures, but to increase with the inclusion of astored product: either maize kernels or house fly medium. According to the authors, it may be suitableas a fumigant or vapor-phase insecticide because of its high volatility, fumigation efficacy and safety.In addition, PUL was found to elicite the appropriate in vivo effects on T. castaneum paralysis andmortality [382]. Strong activity was also observed against Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera) andMoechotypa diphysis (Coleoptera) [383].The fumigant effect of the oil of Mentha pulegium L. against adults of S. oryzae was alsoinvestigated [261]. The authors attributed it to the high content of PUL. The toxicity of thisMolecules 2017, 22, 290 30 of 50ketone against S. oryzae was also observed [384]. However, according to some authors [385–387],the insecticidal activity of the EO is not limited only to its major constituents and it could also be dueto some minor constituents. Notably, it was confirmed that some “inactive” constituents may havesynergistic effect on the “active” ones and that, although not active individually, their presence isnecessary to achive full toxicity [388,389]. Some authors have even indicated better effectiveness ofketones compared with the structurally similar alcohols [377].Larvicidal activity of PUL against the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera) wasalso investigated, showing high activity against all larval stages with LC50 values from 10.3 to48.7 mg·L−1 [247]. Beside the acute toxicity, the authors also tested the possible synergistic effects ofpiperonyl butoxide (PBO), a well-known synergist that has been widely used to enhance the efficacy ofnatural or synthetic pyrethroids. Its addition significantly increased the activity of PUL. Additionaly,the ability of PUL to modify the ovipositional activity of Ae. aegypti was analyzed, and the strongrepellent/deterrent activity was observed.18. Other Bioactivities of PULThe phytotoxic properties of PUL have been also analyzed. It has been characterized as one of thebest candidates for chemical modification for the production of potential soybean (Glycine max (L.)Merr.) herbicides [250]. The study included the inhibition analysis of crop and weed seed germination,as well as seedling growth, by various monoterpenes. PUL was found to be among the inhibitoriestcompounds to the greatest number of species, since it completely suppressed germination of five of thenine species tested, including three of four tested weeds. Ideally, a herbicide should completely inhibitgermination and growth of target weed species, while having little or no effect on the crop. Accordingly,PUL had no effect on the soybean germination and inhibited just 46% of its seedling growth, whilethe weeds tested (Amaranthus retroflexus L., Abutilon theophrasti Medik., Lolium multiflorum Lam. andDigitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) were completely or substantially affected by its addition.A Styrofoam cup soil bioassay was used to evaluate phytotoxicity of monoterpenoids on cornplants and roots [246]. The authors have characterized PUL as the safer monoterpenoid in theexperiment, which did not show any phytotoxicity at any concentration used. On the other side, it hasbeen noted that all plants produce secondary compounds that are phytotoxic to some degree, placingPUL among the more phytotoxic ones of the hundreds of known plant-derived monoterpenes [390].The strong activity of PUL against the cotton/southern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita(Heteroderidae) was found [389]. Larvae immersion in test solutions of PUL for 24 h at theconcentration of 468 µg·mL−1 achieved 100% paralysis. The EC50 value was estimated at 150 µg·mL−1.The study included different EOs and their main terpene constituents, showing higher nematicidalactivity of terpenes when tested individually. Accordingly, it could be explained by the antagonisticaction when they are part of EO. Similar result and EC50 value were obtained in the analysis againstM. javanica [249].Anti-inflammatory activity of PUL through the inhibition of inflammatory mediators releasinghas also been demonstrated [391]. It was found that this terpene blocked prostaglandin and otherinflammatory mediator’s formation in diarrhea which may in part explain its antisecretory effect.Antipyretic activity in rats of Calamintha sylvatica Bromf. EO has been reported, pointing out theresponsibility of PUL and other major monoterpenes in exerting this effect [29]. PUL has been demonstratedto have moderate antioxidant activity [392]. Its radical scavenging activity and inhibitory effect onlipoxygenase have been investigated [11]. However, no effect was shown. It is well-documented thatPUL is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase activity among ketones [382,393].The effect of PUL on the central nervous system has been evaluated via a variety of experimentalbehavioural models in mice [233]. It was shown that PUL caused a significant decrease in ambulationand an increase in pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice, indicating a central depressant effectat a dose of 200 mg·kg−1 after i.p. injection. In contrast, it has been shown that PUL promotedambulation, a CNS-stimulant action, in imprinting control region (ICR) mice via the dopaminergicMolecules 2017, 22, 290 31 of 50system [232]. Further, it has been found that PUL (300 mg·kg−1 i.p.) also significantly increased thelatency of convulsions, as assessed by the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) method, and had an effect similarto that of diazepam, a standard anticonvulsant drug [233]. The antinociceptive properties of thismonoterpene were assessed using several pain models. Chemical nociception induced in the first andsecond phase of the subplantar formalin test was significantly inhibited by PUL and was not blockedby naloxone. At the concentrations from 31.3 to 125 mg·kg−1 i.p., PUL dose-dependently inhibitedboth phases of the formalin test in a manner similar to that of morphine. This pharmacological propertywas confirmed by the hot plate test, which specifically measures central thermal nociceptive responses,showing the increase of the reaction latency of the mice by PUL addition. The results suggest thatPUL is a psychoactive compound and has the profile of an analgesic drug. This is in accordance withseveral other studies on different monoterpenes and their pharmacological properties as psychoactivedrugs [212,214,394–399]. The EO of Calamintha sylvatica Bromf. has been found to exert sedatingactivity in rats, and the authors attributed it to PUL and other major monoterpenes [29].19. Conclusions and Future PerspectivesIn general, plants have provided a source of inspiration for novel drug compounds. The increasedinterest in alternative natural substances is driving the research community to find new uses andapplications for these substances and has led to a considerable increase in the use of medicinal plants.The results of the cited studies indicate that CN and PUL, as the main compound of EOCN, show awide range of biological activities.According to the Flora Europeae [15], CN includes two subspecies: nepeta and glandulosa. Havingon mind their quite unstable taxonomic statuses, as well as various taxonomic treatments of the entiregenus Calamintha Mill. (its uncertain separation from some other Lamiaceae genera), data collectionseems to be inexhaustible. The existing literature abounds in synonyms, and even bigger problemarises at the subspecies level. Furthermore, some plant material has not sometimes been characterizedin terms of subspecies (determined only to the level of species), which makes it particularly hard todraw conclusions and to compare data. Their separation seems to be irrelevant, especially takinginto account the possibility of incompleted or even incorrect determination of material. On theother side, the question of valid recognition of these two taxa has been the subject of several studiesincluding morpho-anatomical and phytochemical points of view [34,44,46–48,70–74]. Examination ofthe diagnostic characters between this two subspecies showes that many of them overlap. In addition,the evidence from phytochemical studies resulted in the conclusion that the chemical composition isquite independent of the subspecies and that they both can produce the same volatiles with p-menthaneskeleton oxygenated in C-3. Consequently, their nomenclatural situation has been thoroughlydiscussed, making it impossible to distinguish two taxa in CN complex. Based on that, we haveindiscriminately collected the literature data of one or the other subspecies, as well as of the numeroussynonyms. Plenty of data about CN chemical composition has been discovered. The describedchemotypes are diverse, and at least three can be distinguished with some exceptions. However,the most abundant one consists of PUL as the major oil constituent associated with menthone and/orisomenthone, menthol and its isomers, with possible low amounts of piperitone, piperitenone and/ortheir oxides. Reviewing the data presented herein, it seems quite reasonable to treat both subspecies asthe same taxa, particularly having in mind their phytochemical properties and widespread traditionaluses that, for sure, do not include recognition at any rate lower than a species level.The contribution of each ingredient to the overall activity of an EO is a complicated patternof interactions. The biological properties of the essence from the aromatic plants can be the resultof synergism or antagonism, and may be attributable both to their major and minor components.Thus, investigation of the main EO compounds alone seems questionable. However, PUL is usuallythe dominant constituent (sometimes more than 80%) in EOCN and was found to reflect quite wellthe biophysical and biological features of the whole oil. According to many authors, it seems to beMolecules 2017, 22, 290 32 of 50responsible for a lot of bioactivities, although it is possible that its activity is slightly modulated by theother minor molecules, as has recently been reported [76].Considering all the available data about different biological activities of CN and PUL, the greatvalues of this plant and its main constituent can be pointed out. This, for sure, justifies its traditional usein many cultures, as well as the use of other PUL-rich plant species. On the other side, the toxicologicalstudies of PUL and its metabolites point to the need for precaution in exposure to it, thereby limitingits use in food products.Moderate to strong antibacterial and antifungal activities were found for CN and PUL. However,to the best of our knowledge, the data indicating their antiviral effects are missing. Thus, that fieldcan be considered as an interesting one for the future examinations. It should be added that furtherstudies are needed to evaluate the in vivo potential in animal experimental models since there is littledata on that aspect.The studies on the antioxidant potential of CN have shown its weak to strong activity, which maybe due to the different phenolic contents, possibly dependent of the sample origin. Contrary to that,there is little data available for PUL. Insecticidal properties of EOCN and PUL were thoroughlyevaluated, revealing their good potential as insecticides, anti-feedants, repellents or fumigants.Their phytotoxic activities were also demonstrated, indicating the potential use of the oil or some of itsconstituents as a source of novel bioherbicides for weed management.In folk medicine, an infusion of CN leaves is employed to treat gastrointestinal diseases, and itseupeptic and carminative effects improve digestion. Moreover, the herbs with high PUL content havebeen used as components of herbal teas for stomach disorders. For these reasons, CN and PUL havebeen subjected to a plenty of analyses aiming to prove its benefits. The results indubitably support theethnomedical uses of this plant.Additional bioactivities of EOCN, as well as PUL, have been investigated. The results showedgood potential in relation to spasmolytic, hypoglycemic and sedative activities, among others. There isalso a significant number of studies on different CN extracts that can be continued avenues of study inthe future. Also, future studies should further explore the possible beneficial synergistic properties ofcombining PUL or EOCN with other natural or synthetic compounds.Acknowledgments: The authors are thankful to Predrag Jovanovic´ and Branka Kneževic´ for proofreading thepaper.
