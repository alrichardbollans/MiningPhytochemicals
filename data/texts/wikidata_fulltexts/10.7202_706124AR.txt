INTRODUCTION 
Alternaria brassicae causes the econom-
ically important black spot disease of 
Brassica crops in many parts of the 
world (Tewari 1991). Résistance infalse 
flax [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] to 
Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. is 
associated with the production of phy-
toalexins (Conn et al. 1988; Jejelowo et 
al. 1991 ). Thèse phytoalexins were sub-
sequently identified as camalexin and 
6-methoxycamalexin (Browne et al. 
1991). Camalexin was also later report-
ed f rom Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) 
Heynh. challenged with Pseudomonas 
syringae pv. syringaevan Hall (Tsuji et 
al. 1992). Because of récent interest in 
thèse compounds (Ayer et al. 1992; 
Gross 1993; Pedras et al. 1997; Tsuji et 
al. 1993), we report on the isolation of 
thèse compounds, and a new related 
compound, from shepherd's purse 
[Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic] 
challenged with A. brassicae. Capsella 
bursa-pastoris is a common weed be-
longing to the family Brassicaeae and is 
highly résistant to A. brassicae and A. 
brassicicola Groves & S ko I ko (Conn et 
al. 1988; Sigareva and Earle 1997; Tew-
ari and Conn 1993). It is also cold tol-
érant, short life-cycled, and résistant to

flea beetles (Bonfils et al. 1991; Sigare-
va and Earle 1997). Ail thèse are useful 
traits required for genetic improvement 
of Brassica crops and some récent stud-
ies hâve focussed on this area (Bonfils 
et al. 1991; Sigareva and Earle 1997). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
General 
Melting points were determined on a 
Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus 
and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra 
(IR) were obtained using a Nicolet 750 
FTIR spectrophotometer. Electron im-
pact mass spectra (EIMS) were obtained 
using a Kratos AEI MS50 high resolu-
tion mass spectrometer. Ultraviolet (UV) 
spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-
Packard 8450A diode array spectrome-
ter. 1H nuclear magnetic résonance 
spectra (1H-NMR) were obtained using 
the following spectrometers: Bruker 
WH-360 (360 MHz), Bruker AM-400 
(400 MHz), and Varian Unity-500 (500 
MHz). Coupling constants are reported 
within ±0.5 Hz. 13C nuclear magnetic 
résonance spectra were obtained on a 
Bruker AM-300 (75 MHz) and Bruker 
AM-400 (100.6 MHz). Carbon-13 multi-
plicities were determined using spin 
écho J-modulated experiments (APT or 
Attached Proton Test). Nuclear Over-
hauser Enhancement (NOE) experi-
ments were determined in the différ-
ence mode in which a control spectrum 
was computer-subtracted from the irra-
diated spectrum after Fourier Transfor-
mation. Positive enhancements appear 
as signais possessing opposite phase 
with respect to the irradiated signal. 
Samples for NOE measurements were 
o> deoxygenated with argon for 10-20 min 
«- prior to use. Homonuclear decoupling 
5 experiments were performed using the 
» Bruker DISNMR software package. High 
z Performance Médium Pressure Liquid 
2 Chromatography (HPMPLC) was carried 
o out on ACE Glass Inc. Michel-Miller 
H equipment using a solvent pump from 
g Fluid Metering Inc. model RP-SY. Com-
Q pounds were detected using the ISCO 
£ V4 wavelength absorbance detector, 
x and fractions were collected with the 
ISCO fraction collecter model 820. High 
Pressure Liquid Chromatography 
(HPLC) analyses were performed on a 
Waters 600E System Controller 
equipped with a 490E Programmable 
multiwavelength U.V. detector, and 
M730 Data Module. 
Plant material 
Plants were grown for 6-8 wk in a 
greenhouse at approximately 18/12°C 
(day/night) and a light intensity 400-600 
|imol»m 2,s 1. Plants were also collected 
from fields in Central Alberta. Ail plants 
used, includïng the siliques thereon, 
were lush green. 
Fungal strains 
Stock cultures of the fungus A. brassi-
cae(University of Alberta Micro Fungus 
Herbarium culture #UAMH 7476) were 
stored on slants in tubes on V-8 juice 
agar (200 mL filtered V-8 juice, 0.05 g 
rose bengal, 3 g CaC03, 20 g agar, 
800 mL H20) at 4°C. Cladosporium sp. 
(to be used in biossay) was stored on 
tube slants on malt extract agar (30 g 
malt extract, 15 g agar, 1 L H20) at 4°C. 
Alternaria brassicae was aseptically 
transferred from slants to Pétri dishes 
containing V-8 juice agar. The cultures 
were allowed to grow in the clark at 
room température for 10-12 d and then 
stored at 4°C. Inoculum was prepared 
by washing the conidia from the plate 
with 10 mL of stérile, distilled water. 
The resulting aqueous suspension 
(10 000-20 000 spores mL1) was used 
to inoculate liquid média. Alternaria 
brassicae was grown in V-8 juice médi-
um (200 mL filtered V-8 juice, 0.75 g 
CaC03, 800mLH20). The cultures (500 
mL liquid médium in 1 L-Fernbackflask) 
were kept in the dark at room tempér-
ature understill-culture conditions. The 
fungus was harvested after 12 d. The 
mycélium was separated from the broth 
by gravity filtration through cheese 
cloth. This mycélium was blended with 
stérile distilled water to obtain a sus-
pension which was used in phytoalex-
in-elicitation experiments as follows. 
Phytoalexin elicitation 
Detached plant material (1 kg leaves 
and in some cases whole plants with-
out roots but with flowers and siliques) 
was dipped into a mycelial suspension 
100 
Jl ME NEZ ET AL. : PHYTOALEXINS IN CAPSELLA BURSA-PASTORIS 
and then placed in a humid chamber in 
plastic trays lined with moist paper 
towels and covered with clear polyeth-
ylene sheets. The control was dipped 
in distilled water and also placed in a 
humid chamber. The plant material was 
brought from the greenhouse and the 
field, and incubated on a laboratory 
bench at room température under con-
tinuous white fluorescent light for 5 d. 
Phytoalexins were extracted from the 
plant material before sénescence oc-
curred, and saprophytic growth of A. 
brassicae took place. 
Multiwell method 
The isolation of active metabolites was 
bioassay-directed as described by Tri-
fonov et al. (1992). The sample was 
sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 
\im nylon membrane. A 200 \xL sample 
of the fraction to be bioassayed was 
applied directly to the well of the mul-
tiwell plate (6-well, flat bottom, Falcon 
3046) using a micropipette. The sol-
vent was evaporated in a stérile fume-
hood for 3 h. The inoculum was ob-
tained from the growing edge of a col-
ony of Cladosporium sp. in malt agar 
Pétri dishes. After 4 d of growth at 
room température, a plug (7 mm diam) 
eut from this culture was placed in each 
well of the multiwell plate. Three rep-
licates for each fraction and the solvent 
(control) were evaluated in each multi-
well plate. This procédure was repeat-
ed for ail fractions which showed the 
same Rf value at each chromatographic 
step. Inhibition in the radial growth of 
Cladosporium sp. relative to the control 
was regarded as a positive resuit. 
Isolation of active metabolites 
Five d after inoculation, the leaves were 
macerated in a Waring blender with 
methanol-water (7:3, 12 L). The filtered 
extract was concentrated under reduced 
pressure to 500 mL, water (100 mL) was 
added and the solution was extracted 
with ethyl acétate (3 x 500 mL). This 
extract was washed with 5% aqueous 
HCI, then made basic with aqueous 
NH4OH and extracted wi th dichlo-
romethane. Removal of the solvent left 
a viscous oil (0.6 g). Flash chromatog-
raphy of the crude extract afforded a 
mixture of three compounds (Rf=0.35-
0.50, 2% methanol in dichloromethane). 
HPMPLC (RP-18, 20-40 |im) using 60% 
aqueous methanol on this mixture af-
forded camalexin and 6-methoxycama-
lexin. HPLC ([i Bondpak™ C-18, 7.8 x 
300 mm, 125Â) using 50% aqueous 
methanol afforded N-methylcamalexin. 
The camalexin (1) and 6-methoxyca-
malexin (2), as shown on Fig. 1, were 
identified by comparison (1H NMR, IR, 
UV) with authentic samples (available 
in our laboratories, Browne et al. 1991). 
N-methylcamalexin. 1H NMR (CDCI3): 
87.74 (S, H-2), 8.16 (dd, J = 8, 1 Hz, 
H-4), 7.30 (m, H-5), 7.35 (m, H-6), 7.45 
(dd, J = 8, 1.5 Hz, H-7), 7.8 (d, J = 2.5, 
H-4'), 7.20 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-5'), 3.86 
(s, 3H, N-CH3); Calculated for C12H10N2S, 
214.2844: found 214.2840 amu. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In bioassay, the activity was found to 
réside in the basic material. Flash chro-
matography of the basic fraction fol-
lowed by médium pressure liquid chro-
matography on reversed phase silica 
gel providedthetwo major components. 
HPLC of the residues provided small 
amounts of a third component. 
The major component (Rf=0.35) had 
a molecular formula of C11H8N2S as de-
termined by EIMS. Absorption at 3430 
cm"1 in the IR spectrum suggested the 
présence of an NH group. This obser-
vation is consistent with the UV spec-
trum (\max = 214, 274, 318) for an indole 
moiety. The 1H NMR showed seven 
aromatic signais at 88.68, 7.26, 7.18, 
6.93, 7.77, and 7.17 and a broad signal 
at 89.0 for the indolic (exchangeable) 
hydrogen. 
In NOE experiments, the présence of 
a 3-substituted indole moiety was de-
tected. The hydrogens at 87.3 (H2) and 
86.9 (H7) exhibited enhancement upon 
irradiation of the N-H signal (88.6). 
Homodecoupling experiments on the 
spin System H4'-H5' in the thiazole 
moiety showed the appropriate coupling 
constants (J4,5 = 3 Hz) (Jackman and 
Sternhell 1969). Therefore, the prés-
ence of a 2-substituted thiazole was

substantiated. Comparison IR, 1H NMR, 
13C NMR spectra of this compound with 
an authentic sample of camalexin (1) 
confirmed the identity (Fig. 1). 
The second compound showed a 
molecular formula C12H10N2SO,suggest-
ing an additional methoxy group. In-
deed, its 1H NMR showed a singlet at 
83.88 and 13C NMR showed a new sig-
nal at 855.7. Absorption at higher 
wavelength in the UV spectrum was 
consistent with this observation. The 
relative position of a methoxy group on 
the aromatic ring was determined by 
NOE experiments. The hydrogens at 
86.8 and 87.7 exhibited enhancement 
upon irradiation of the signal at 88.6 
(N-H). In addition, signais at 86.94 and 
86.87 showed 2.8 and 3.2% NOE, re-
spectively, upon irradiation of the sig-
nal at 83.88 (methoxy group). Compar-
isons with an authentic sample of 6-
methoxycamalexin (2) completed the 
identification (Fig. 1). 
Further analysis of the crude organic 
extract by HPLC (RP-C18, 50% aqueous 
methanol) showed the présence of a 
third compound. The molecularformu-
la C12H10N2S indicated the addition of 
one methyl group to camalexin. The 
main différence observed in the 1H-NMR 
of this compound, compared with the 
two other camalexins, was the prés-
ence of an N-methyl signal at 83.86. 
The lack of an O-methyl signal and the 
similarity of the remainder of the 1H 
NMR spectrum with that of camalexin 
(1), suggested that this minor metabo-
lite possesses the structure (3) (N-me-
thylcamalexin) (Fig. 1). This compound 
has not been reported previously. 
None of the compounds 1, 2, or 3 
were isolated from plant material in the 
control experiment. Thèse compounds 
satisfy the définition of phytoalexins 
(Paxton 1981) in C. bursa-pastoris as 
they are antimicrobial and are accumu-
lated in the plant after challenge by the 
pathogen. Also, they resemble other 
phytoalexins from plants of the family 
Brassicaceae in containing an indole 
moiety and sulphur (Gross 1993). 
Some research has been done on the 
rôle of camalexin in the host-defense 
Systems of C. sativa and A. thaliana 
(Conn et al. 1988, 1994; Jejelowo et al. 
1991; Rogers et al. 1996; Tsuji et al. 
1992). Camalexin is the major phyto-
alexin in C. bursapastoris and is asso-
ciated with high degrees of résistance 
to A. brassicae and A. brassicicola (Conn 
étal. 1988; Jejelowo et al. 1991;Sigare-
va and Earle 1997). It has also been 
shown to be toxic to A. brassicae (Conn 
1991; J.P. Tewari and P. Kutschy, un-
published data), A. solani (Jejelowo 
1995), and Rhizoctonia solani Kùhn 
(Conn et al. 1994) in in vitro studies. 
EC50for inhibition of conidial germtube 
growth of A. brassicae is approximately

6 \ig mL 1 and the MIC (minimum 
inhibitory concentration) for complète 
inhibition of germtube growth is 80 /Ltg 
mL1 (Jejelowo et al. 1991). Low yields 
of phytoalexins, such as 6-methoxyca-
malexin and N-methylcamalexin hâve 
so far not permitted such studies.
