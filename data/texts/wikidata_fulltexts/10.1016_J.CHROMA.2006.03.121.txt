dThis study reports the development and validation of a rapid, sensitive and selective assay for the quantitation of artemisinin, arteannuin B,
rtemisitene and artemisinic acid in Artemisia annua L. by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) electrospray (ESI)
uadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A recovery of >97% for all analytes was achieved by immersing one
ram of fresh plant material in chloroform for 1 min. This result supports the hypothesis that artemisinin and some of its structural analogs present
n the leaves A. annua L. are localized entirely in the subcuticular space of the glands on the surface of the leaves. We validated the use of this
hloroform extract, without additional sample preparation steps, for quantitative Q-TOF MS/MS. No ion suppression (matrix effect) resulting from
nterference with other compounds was detected. For every concentration within the range of the standard curve (0.1 to 3.00g/ml), accuracy was
etween 85% and 115%. Within- and between-day variations for the analysis of A. annua L. samples were <20%.

. Introduction
Malaria is one of the world’s most important parasitic dis-
ases. There are at least 300 million acute cases of malaria
ach year globally, resulting in more than a million deaths [1,2].
ulti-drug resistance of the Plasmodium strains to the cheap-
st and most widely used antimalarials such as chloroquine,
efloquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is one of the biggest
hallenges in the fight against malaria [1].
Artemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood), a herb of the Aster-
ceae family has been used for centuries for the treatment of
ever and malaria [3]. Artemisinin, an endoperoxide-containing
esquiterpene lactone, is the main component responsible for
his therapeutic effect. Based on artemisinin, several semi-
ynthetic derivatives such as artemether, arteether and artesunate

have been produced [3]. The WHO recommends that all coun-
tries experiencing resistance to conventional monotherapies
should use combination therapies, preferably those containing
artemisinin derivatives (ACTs—artemisinin-based combination
therapies) [4,5].
As artemisinin cannot be synthesized chemically in an eco-
nomically feasible way, A. annua is the only practical source of
this valuable drug [6]. Unfortunately, A. annua contains only
very small amounts of artemisinin ranging from 0.001% to
1.54% of dry weight [7]. Several research programs have been
set up trying to increase the concentration of artemisinin in A.
annua by optimizing the growing and harvesting conditions, by
selecting high yielding cultivars or by creating transgenic plants
[6,8]. To study the content of artemisinin and its biosynthetic pre-
cursors in plants, we developed a very simple extraction method
followed by HPLC–ESI MS/MS.
Several other methods have been reported for the extraction,
chromatography and detection of artemisinin and its structural
analogs in A. annua. Liquid solvent extraction of dried plant

material is currently the most commonly applied technique.
Also more complicated extraction techniques such as super crit-
ical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized solvent extraction (PSE)
and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) have been used. For
the quantitation of artemisinin a large array of techniques have
been developed including thin layer chromatography (TLC),
high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection
(HPLC-UV), HPLC with electrochemical detection (HPLC-
ECD), HPLC with evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-
ELSD), gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector (GC-
FID), GC coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS), GC coupled
to tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS), supercritical fluid
chromatography with FID (SFC-FID), ELSD (SFC-ELSD) or
MS (SFC-MS) and capillary electrophoresis with UV detection
(CE-UV). A review by Christen et al. [9] gives an excellent
overview of these techniques and discusses some of them in
more detail.
Some of these methods such as TLC, EC and UV-
detection (artemisinin is UV-transparent therefore derivatisation
is required) are time-consuming and not suited for routine anal-
ysis. More important is the fact that most of these methods lack
specificity (TLC, UV-detection, FID, ECD, ELSD). As an A.
annua plant extract may contain hundreds of components, some
structural analogues of artemisinin, good specificity of the detec-
tor is essential.

2.2. Artemisia annua L. plants
The plants were grown under controlled conditions (21 ◦C;
12 h day/12 h night regime). Seeds were kindly provided by the
National Botanic Garden of Belgium (Meise, Belgium).
2.3. Analytical standards
Individual stock solutions (1 mg/ml) of artemisinin, artean-
nuin B, artemisitene, artemisinic acid and internal standard
-artemether were prepared by accurately weighing required
amounts into separate volumetric flasks and dissolving in appro-
priate volumes of methanol. Analytical standards were prepared
as a mixture of each analyte (0.1g/ml to 3g/ml each) and the
internal standard (0.4g/ml) by serial dilution of stock solutions
in methanol–1 mM ammonium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 5
with acetic acid (50/50, v/v).
2.4. Sample preparation
Extraction was performed by immersing one gram of plant
material in 6 ml chloroform for 1 min. An aliquot of 10l of
this extract was then dissolved in 1 ml methanol–1 mM ammo-
nium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 5 with acetic acid (50/50,
v/v) containing 0.4g/ml of the I.S. -artemether. This proce-
dure was carried out on the plants of interest: Artemisia annua

tS/MS present a major advantage for the detection of spe-
ific components in plant extracts. Several GC–MS [10,11],
PLC-MS [12–15] and HPLC-MS/MS [16] methods have been
eveloped to analyze artemisinin and its derivatives in blood,
lasma or serum. For analysis of A. annua extracts a SFC-MS
ethod has been reported [17].
To our knowledge, we report the first MS/MS method devel-
ped to analyze artemisinin and its biosynthetic precursors in
. annua. The main advantages of our method are not only the
xcellent specificity but also the extremely short and efficient
ample preparation.
. Experimental
.1. Chemicals
Pure reference standard of artemisinin, 98% was obtained
rom Sigma–Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium). The other reference
tandards arteannuin B, artemisitene and artemisinic acid
ere kindly provided by the Walter Reed Army Institute
f Research (Washington, USA). The internal standard (I.S.)
-artemether was a gift from Arenco Pharmaceutica N.V. (Geel,
elgium).
LC–MS grade absolute methanol was obtained from Biosolve
Valkenswaard, the Netherlands). Analytical grade chloroform
as obtained from Acros (Geel, Belgium). Analytical grade
mmonium acetate, analytical grade sodium acetate and acetic
cid (99.8%) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Bornem, Bel-
ium). Purified water of 18.2 M/cm was obtained from a Milli-
system (Millipore, Belgium).. (Asteraceae) and the negative controls Artemisia Absinthium
. (Asteraceae), Mentha spicata L. (Lamiaceae) and Mentha
iperita L. (Lamiaceae).
.5. Liquid chromatography
A Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system was used to deliver the
obile phase [pump A, 1 mM ammonium acetate buffer adjusted
o pH 5 with acetic acid; pump B, 100% methanol] for gradient
lution at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The initial composition of
0:50 was maintained for 1 min; next the methanol content was
ncreased linearly to 80% over a period of 6 min and maintained
or 18 min. Re-equilibration time was 10 min between runs. The
ample injection volume was 100l for all samples. Chromato-
raphic separations were achieved on an Alltech Ultrasphere
18 IP 5m column (150 mm × 2.1 mm) protected by a Waters
Terra MS C18 5m guard column (10 × 2.1). A LC Packings
CUrate ICP-04-20 post-column splitter was used to divert one-
ourth of the effluent into the electrospray LC–MS interface.
.6. Q-TOF mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometric detection was performed on a Q-TOF
ltima mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK)
quipped with an electrospray source operating in positive
ode (ESP+). The ESI capillary voltage was set at 2.7 kV. The
ource and desolvation temperatures were optimized at 130 and
00 ◦C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas with
flow rate of 500 l/h. MS/MS analysis was performed using
rgon (0.9 bar) as the collision gas. An MS/MS method was used
o quantify artemisinin (m/z 283 → 219 + 229 + 247 + 265),

arteannuin B (m/z 249 → 185 + 189 + 203 + 231), artemisitene
(m/z 281 → 217 + 227 + 245 + 263), artemisinic acid (m/z 252
→ 189 + 199 + 217) and -artemether (m/z 316 → 267
+ 284 + 307). Cone voltage had an optimum at 40 V for all
components. The collision energy was optimized at 7 eV for
artemisinin, 10 eV for arteannuin B, 7 eV for artemisitene,
11 eV for artemisinic acid and 7 eV for -artemether. Data
acquisition and analysis were carried out using Masslynx
version 4.0. software. Analytical standard curves (second-order
polynomic regression) were calculated using analyte to I.S.
peak area ratios. The concentrations of the respective analytes
in test samples are interpolated from the standard curves using
the analyte to I.S. peak area ratios from the test samples.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sample preparation
Most plant extraction methods start with lyophilisation or
drying of the plant material, followed by extraction with an
organic solvent such as hexane or toluene [9]. As all cells are
disrupted by these extraction methods, all soluble components
are extracted from the plant. These extracts contain a massive
amount of components (e.g. chlorophyll) interfering with HPLC
(clogging) and MS (matrix effect). Additional sample prepara-
tion has to be performed prior to HPLC–MS/MS. Unfortunately
these additional steps (solid phase extraction, filtering, evapora-
tion steps) are not only time-consuming, but are also a possible
source of variations in recovery.
In the specific case of the extraction of artemisinin and its bio-
precursors from A. annua, these problems can be avoided. Duke
et al. [18] reported that a 5 s dip in chloroform extracted 97% of
the artemisinin and 100% of artemisitene from A. annua. In the
report by Duke et al., quantitation was performed by HPLC-UV
after derivatisation. Light microscopy and transmission elec-
tron microscopy revealed that the 5 s dip results in collapse of
the subcuticular cavity of the glands on the leaf surface but
did not disrupt cell membranes. An A. annua biotype with-
out glands contained neither artemisinin nor artemisitene [18].
These results indicate that artemisinin and artemisitene present
in foliar tissue are localized entirely in the subcuticular space of
glands of A. annua.

We hypothesized that this chloroform extract can be analyzed
on a mass spectrometer without additional sample preparation
steps as it contains only a very small quantity of interfering
components (e.g. chlorophyll) compared to plant extracts where
the plant material is lyophilized, dried or grinded.
3.2. Extraction time
We decided to prolong the extraction time as long as possible
to break open as much glands as possible without introduc-
ing interfering compounds. After an extraction time of 1 min,
chlorophyll starts to be released into the chloroform, indicating
that cells with interfering compounds begin to break open. Fig. 1
shows a picture of glandular trichomes before and after a 1 min
chloroform extraction. The cuticle is crumpled after chloroform
extraction. The epidermal cells are unaffected by the treatment.
The extraction time of 1 min was validated during the recovery
studies.
3.3. Recovery
Two different experiments were done to asses the recovery. In
a first experiment, 15 equal samples of one gram fresh A. annua
leaves were prepared, 5 of which were spiked with 60l of a
10 mg/ml methanol solution of each analyte. Immediately after

with a previous described extraction method [19] before and
after our one-minute chloroform extraction. Six equal samples of
one gram fresh leaf material were prepared. Three of them were
extracted following a previously described extraction method
[19]. Briefly, this method consists of an extraction with 2 × 3 ml
toluene after lyophilisation and pulverization of the plant mate-
rial followed by a normal-phase Silica gel solid-phase extraction
(SPE). An aliquot of 1 ml of plant extract was passed through
the 500 mg Silica gel column, followed by washing with 2 ml
petroleum ether–diethyl ether (9:1) and elution with 2 × 0.5 ml
acetonitrile. The eluate was evaporated to dryness under N2
and reconstituted in 1 ml methanol–ammonium acetate buffer
(50/50, v/v) for further analysis. Note that compared to our
method, the analytes are a 100 fold more concentrated by this
SPE. The other three samples were subjected to exactly the
same extraction protocol, but after they were first extracted by
our method (1 min chloroform extraction). Table 2 gives and
overview of the results. The amount of artemisinin, arteannuin B
and artemisinic acid found in the plant material after chloroform
treatment was less than 3% compared to the amount found in the
three non-pretreated samples. This experiment shows that >97%
of artemisinin, arteannuin B, and artemisinic acid is extracted
by a 1 min dip in chloroform. As a 1 min dip in chloroform is
the only sample preparation step in our method, we conclude
that a recovery of > 97% can be achieved by our method. For
artemisitene, the results are less conclusive as the measured

ecoveries of the 5 spiked samples were calculated as the ratio
etween the measured quantity and the spiked quantity increased
ith the mean quantity of the analytes in the 10 unspiked sam-
les. Table 1 shows the mean of the recoveries for the different
nalytes (>97% for each analyte).
This very high recovery (>97%) of the spiked amounts does
ot imply a high recovery of the amounts present in the plant. The

ry in a second experiment by comparing the recovery achieved

acetate buffer and performing analysis on the [M + Na]+
adducts. This approach was abandoned due to variation
caused by build up of sodium acetate deposits on the
ion sampling cone of the mass spectrometer. Finally we
decided to use ammonium acetate buffer and to perform
MS/MS analysis on the [M + H]+ (artemisinin, artemisitene,
arteannuin B) or [M + NH4]+ (artemisinic acid, artemether)
adducts.
A total of 3 isocratic and 25 gradient elutions were com-
pared, testing varying methanol–buffer ratios and testing varying
gradient speeds. The method with the highest peak resolution
was chosen. The reproducibility of the retention times was very
dependent on the buffer concentration. Increasing the buffer
concentration from 0.1 mM to 1 mM greatly enhanced the repro-
ducibility of the retention times, resulting in a variation of less
than 25 s. By varying the pH of the ammonium acetate buffer,
the retention time of artemisinic acid can be influenced. Peak
resolution was optimal at pH 5. Using final conditions, all ana-
lytes were separated from each other with peak resolutions from
1.0 to 2.4 (Fig. 2).
The column and guard column were stable for at least 1000
injections. No signs of column deterioration have been detected
yet.
3.5. Speciﬁcity
In contrast with [M + Na]+ adducts, the [M + H]+ and
[M + NH4]+ adducts were easily fragmented with low colli-
sion energies. Fig. 3 shows the fragmentation spectrum of
artemisinin at an optimal collision energy of only 7 eV. Between
3 and 4 fragments were chosen to be monitored for each
analyte. Using the sum of several fragments for MS/MS
quantitation, has the advantage of increased signal strength
and enhanced signal stability, but the disadvantage of lower
specificity. As fragments with higher m/z values tend to be
more specific, fragments with the highest m/z values were
selected.
To check the specificity of the method, chloroform extracts of
Mentha piperita,Mentha spicata andArtemisia absinthiumwere
analyzed. These three plant species also have epidermal glands

on their leaves, but are not reported to produce artemisinin. In
these control extracts, no MS/MS signal could be detected for
the components of interest.
3.6. Ion suppression (matrix effect)
To check for interferences from other compounds by ion
suppression (matrix effect) a standard curve obtained from stan-
dards prepared in mobile phase was compared to a standard
curve obtained from standards made in mobile phase spiked
with matrix (10l chloroform extract of Mentha piperita /ml).
HPLC-MS/MS analysis (3 measurements for each sample) of
these standards, resulted in almost identical measurements for
the spiked and the non-spiked standards. The statistical method
of Bland et al. [20] was used for assessing the agreement between
the two methods. The p-values for the t-test with the nulhypoth-
esis that the mean of the differences between both methods is
equal to zero, were 0.53, 0.26, 0.67 and 0.74 for arteannuin
B, artemisinin, artemisitene and artemisinic acid, respectively.
No significant difference could be found for any of the ana-
lytes, meaning that no ion suppression could be detected. For
this reason, in the final method, standards were not spiked with
chloroform extract to include matrix.

accuracy of 80–120%. Within-day accuracy and precision were
calculated with three determinations on one day. Between-day
accuracy and precision were calculated from 7 determinations
on 3 days spanning a two week period. Accuracy and preci-
sion were calculated for each of 7 spiked concentrations (0.1;
0.2; 0.4; 0.8; 1.2; 2.0 and 3.0g/ml) within the range of the
standard curve. Within the range of the standard curve, coeffi-
cient of variation (CV%) was <15% and accuracy was between
85% and 115% for all analytes and all 7 spiked concentrations
(Table 3).
Within- and between-day variation was also calculated for
unspiked A. annua samples. Twenty equal samples of one gram
fresh leaf material were prepared and kept between 4 ◦C to 8 ◦C
until extraction. Ten of these samples were extracted with chloro-
form on day 1, five on day 2 and again five on day 3. The extracts
were stored at −20 ◦C until HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The first 10
extracts (extraction on day one) were analyzed in one day allow-
ing calculation of within-day variation. The other 10 extracts
were analyzed on two different days spanning a two week period.
All 20 independent samples were used to calculate the between-
day variation. The within- and between-day variation of the
complete procedure (extraction and quantitation by MS/MS)
is <20% (Table 3) for all analytes except for artemisitene for
which the amount present in the unspiked samples was below
the LLOQ. The variation for the unspiked samples is higher
than for the spiked samples. A possible reason is variation in the

nower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)
The definitions for accuracy, precision, LOD and LLOQ were
dopted from the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical method val-
dation [21]. The LOD was defined as the lowest observable
eak response for an analyte above the background noise, 3
imes the system noise in the matrix. The LLOQ was defined as
he lowest concentration for an analyte with a response signal 5
imes the system noise in the matrix, a precision of 20% and anelease of the analytes out of the glandular trichomes. Another
ossibility is an actual variation in the 20 samples as the leaves
or these samples were collected from three different plants.
.8. Dynamic range and polynomial regression
Based on the LLOQ and dynamic range of the MS/MS sig-
al, standard curves were established from 0.1 to 3.00g/ml

n. for artemisinin, arteannuin B, artemisitene and artemisinic acid.
Several regression models were evaluated to establish these
curves. For the range of 0.1–3g/ml, a best-fitted second-
order polynomial regression (y = Ax2 + Bx + C) described the
measurements of the analytical standards at best (typically
R2 > 0.99). Limiting the range to 0.1–0.8g/ml, a linear regres-
sion (y = Ax + B) would also be acceptable with R2 > 0.99, but
still a second-order polynomial regression describes this range
better with R2 > 0.999. In practice, the use of a second-order
polynomial regression not only extended the useful dynamic
range, but also reduced the between-day variation.
The range of the standard curves may not extend high
enough to analyze high yielding plants [7]. Dilutions can be
made from the extracts of these plants. To check if these dilu-
tions do not present any ill effects, a sample of one gram
fresh leaf material from A. annua was spiked with 16 mg of
artemisinin in a methanol solution. After evaporation of the
methanol, the artemisinin was extracted and prepared with
the standard sample preparation procedure. Immediately before
HPLC–MS/MS analysis, the sample was diluted 16 fold with
methanol–ammonium acetate buffer (50/50, v/v) containing
0.4g/ml of the internal standard. The diluted sample was mea-
sured 3 times; recovery was 100.0% ± 8.4%.

RThis study reports the development and validation of a rapid,
ensitive and selective assay for the quantitation of artemisinin,
rteannuin B, artemisitene and artemisinic acid inA. annuaL. by
eversed phase HPLC ESI Q-TOF MS/MS. An absolute recovery
f >97% was achieved by immersing one gram of plant mate-
ial in chloroform for 1 min. This result supports the hypothesis
hat artemisinin and some of its structural analogs present in the
eaves of A. annua L. are localized entirely in the subcuticular
pace of the glands on the surface of the leaves. We validated
he use of this chloroform extract for quantitative MS/MS with-
ut additional sample preparation steps. No ion suppression
matrix effect) resulting from interference with other compounds
as detected. To check the specificity of the method, chloro-
orm extracts of Mentha piperita, Mentha spicata and Artemisia
bsinthium were analyzed. These three plants also have epider-
al glands on the leaves, but do not synthesize artemisinin. No
ignal for the components of interest was detected in these con-
rol extracts. With a LOD of at least 0.04g/ml, a LLOQ of
.10g/ml and a dynamic range from 0.10 to 3.00g/ml for
ach analyte, the method has enough sensitivity and flexibility
o measure low and high yielding cultivars. For every concentra-
ion within the range of the standard curve (0.1 to 3.00g/ml),
ccuracy was between 85% and 115%. Within- and between-
ay variations for the analysis of unspiked A. annua L. samples
ere <20%.
