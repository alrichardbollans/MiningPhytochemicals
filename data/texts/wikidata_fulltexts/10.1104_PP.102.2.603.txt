Plant Physiol. (1993) 102: 603-608 Distribution of Gibberellins in Lathyrus odorafus 1. and Their Role in Leaf Growth' John J. ROSS*, lan C. Murfet, and James 6. Reid Department of Plant Science, University of Tasmania, G P O  Box 252C, Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia In sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus 1.) the mutant allele I reduced the level of gibberellin A, (CA,) in expanding leaflets and resulted in smaller, more oval leaflets compared with the wild type. The apical portions of 6-d-old wild-type ( L )  seedlings also contained less CAI and produced smaller, more oval leaflets than did com- parable 20-d-old L seedlings. Application of CAI markedly altered leaflet shape and, at certain dosages, restored the wild-type shape and size to leaflets of the I (dwarf) mutant. Taken together, these observations indicate that CAI performs a regulatory role in the control of leaf growth in this species. The levels of CAI precursors in the wild type were also determined. Rapidly expanding inter- nodes contained much more gibberellin AI9 (CA19) than gibberellin Azo (CAzO), whereas the opposite was true for expanding leaflets. Although in entire apical portions of established seedlings the level of CAzo exceeded that of CAI9, apical portions of very young seedlings contained more CA19 than CAZO. Basal stem tissue of established seedlings also contained substantially more CA,, than GAZo or CA,. Both stems and leaflets from the basal portion of the plant contained much less GAzo and CAI than did the rapidly expanding apical tissue. The implications of these results for the regulation of CAI biosynthesis are discussed. wild-type (tall, L)  plants. Furthermore, it has not been shown that the mutant allele 1 actually affects GA levels within the leaves: previously, entire shoot apical portions have been harvested (Ross et al., 1990~). Finally, environmental or developmental factors that alter the level of GAI and leaf growth in sweet pea have not been identified. The possible involvement of GAI in the growth of sweet pea leaves has assumed added significance in view of uncertainty regarding such a role in the garden pea (Smith, 1992). Although in garden pea it is now clear that gene le (which, like gene 1, also partially blocks the 3P-hydroxylation of GA2,; Ingram et al., 1984) reduces the level of GA, in leaves, coincident changes in leaf development have not been defined (Smith et al., 1992). In the present paper we explore the questions raised above by quantifying GA levels in the leaflets, petioles, and intemodes of tall and dwarf sweet peas and by further investigating the effects of exogenous CAI on leaf develop- ment in this species. In addition, the effects of ontogeny on GA levels and shoot development are examined, as is the influence of tissue maturity on the level of GAl and its precursors. GA1 plays an important role in the control of stem elon- gation in the sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus L.) (Ross et al., 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1992b), as in many other species (Phin- ney and Spray, 1990; Reid, 1990; Takahashi, 1990). This GA may also be important for leaf growth in sweet pea because the mutant allele 1 reduces the level of GAI in shoots (Ross et al., 1990a) and it also affects leaflet size and shape in addition to intemode length (Ross et al., 1990b). Evidence has been obtained from other dicotyledonous species that GAs may function in the control of leaf growth. For example, GA3 application alters leaf shape in severa1 species (Robbins, 1957; Jones, 1987), and leaf growth is altered in GA-deficient mutants of tomato (Koomneef et al., 1990), Brassica rapa (Zanewich et al., 1990), lettuce (Waycott and Taiz, 1991; Waycott et al., 1991), and Thlaspi arvense L. (Metzger and Hassebrock, 1990). The aim of the present study was to obtain definitive evidence that GAI plays a regulatory role in the control of leaf growth in sweet pea. As yet, it has not been demonstrated that application of GAI to dwarf (1) plants results in leaves that are phenocopies of those from genetically comparable ' Supported by an Australian Research Council grant to I.C.M. * Corresponding author; fax 61-02-20-2698. and J.B.R. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Material and Crowing Conditions A11 sweet pea plants (Lathyrus odoratus L.) were of genotype L- (tall) or 11 (dwarf). They were produced from the cross L05 (tall) X L06 (dwarf) and were descended from the same FB ancestor. This ancestor (genotype LI)  was derived by six generations of single plant selection, starting from the F2 (the sweet pea is self fertilized). The plants were grown in 14-cm pots containing a 1:l (v/ v) mixture of dolerite chips (10 mm) and vermiculite, topped with a 2-cm layer of sterilized potting mixture. Other details are provided by Ross and Murfet (1985). All plants were grown in an 18-h photoperiod, consisting of the natural photoperiod extended before dawn and after dusk with light from a mixed fluorescent-incandescent source providing 25 pmol m-2 s-I at pot top. Node counting began from the first scale leaf as node 1. GAI was applied at dosages of O, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 5, and 10 pg per plant, in 10 pL of ethanol, to leaf 4 of 18-d-old plants with four fully expanded leaves. Extraction and Quantification of GAs To investigate the effects of genotype and plant portion on GA levels, L and 1 plants were grown until they possessed 603  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The CAi was applied to leaf 4, andthe leaflets shown are from leaf 11.nine or 10 fully expanded leaves (including two scale leaves).For each plant, the elongating internode and expanding leafimmediately above the uppermost fully expanded leaf wereharvested (on d 44). This enabled comparison of GA levelsin the expanding leaf with those in the elongating internodebelow that leaf. The harvested leaf was partitioned intoleaflets and petiole (with tendril). Harvest details for otherexperiments are given in table headings. To investigate theeffects of ontogeny on GA levels, the apical portions of 6-and 20-d-old L plants were harvested. These were excisedabove node 1 (i.e. the first scale leaf) when the seedlingswere emerging from the soil (6-d-old) or above node 6 (theuppermost fully expanded leaf) of 20-d-old plants. Addition-al plants were left unharvested to allow measurement ofsubsequent leaf and internode growth above the node ofexcision.Harvested tissue was weighed, immersed in cold (— 20°C)methanol, and placed in a freezer. Internal standards werethen added, and the tissue was homogenized in 80% meth-anol. The internal standards were [20-2H,]GA44, [17,17-2H2]-GA19/ [17,17-2H2]GA20, [17,17-2H2]GA,, [17,17-2H2]GA29/[17,17-2H2]GA8, and [17,17-2H2]GA3, provided by ProfessorL.N. Mander, Australian National University, Canberra, and[17-13C, 3H2]GA29, provided by Professor B.O. Phinney, Uni-versity of California, Los Angeles. After extraction of tissueat 4°C for 24 h, the extracts were purified by solvent parti-tioning, Sep-Pak Cis cartridges, and HPLC as before (Reid etal., 1991). The HPLC zones containing GAs were dried,methylated, trimethylsilylated, and analyzed by GC-selectedion monitoring as described previously (Reid et al., 1991).Endogenous GA levels were calculated as detailed by Law-rence et al. (1992) and Ross et al. (1992b), except that forGA]9 the contribution from naturally occurring isotopes wasmeasured rather than calculated.Effect of AppliedRESULTS! on Leaf DevelopmentGAi to both genotypes altered leaflet shape, resulting in achange from oval to an elongated, more elliptical form (Fig.1). This was most apparent at higher dosages, particularly 5and 10 iug per plant, and at several nodes up the stem fromthe application site (leaf 4). In these cases, GAi applicationobscured the difference in leaf shape between the two gen-otypes (Fig. 1), as previously reported (Ross et al., 1990c).The change in shape occurred because in both genotypesGAi increased leaflet length and reduced leaflet width (abovenode 8, Fig. 2). Because of these dual effects, leaflet shape in/ plants appeared to be more sensitive to applied GAi thanwas internode length, in terms of attaining or exceedingvalues observed in the wild type. For example, 0.3 ^g of GA]applied to / plants resulted in leaflets with a significantlyhigher (by up to 33%) length-to-width ratio than untreatedwild-type leaflets at three consecutive nodes (9, 10, and 11;Fig. 3). In contrast, the same dose of GAi caused / internodesto significantly exceed (by 14%) the length of comparableuntreated L internodes for only one internode (7-8; Fig. 3).It is also noteworthy than 0.3 ^g of GA! exerted a maximaleffect on internode length one to two plastochrons earlierthan on leaflet shape (Fig. 3), possibly indicating that leafletshape is influenced at a younger developmental age thaninternode length (i.e. at fewer plastochrons from the apicaldome).The data suggest that the reduction in leaflet width maybe a direct effect of GAi. For example, at node 10 (in / plants)the response of leaflet length to exogenous GAi was saturatedat approximately 0.3 Mg (Fig. 2) and those of internode andpetiole lengths at approximately 1 ^g (data not shown).However, higher dosages of GAi (5 and 10 fig) resulted in afurther reduction in leaflet width (Fig. 2). This indicates thatthe reduction in width is not attributable to competition fornutrients between the processes of lateral leaflet growth andlongitudinal leaflet, internode, and/or petiole elongation.A further aim of the application experiment was to deter-mine whether leaves of / plants are converted into pheno-copies of those from untreated L plants. As far as leafletshape is concerned, the wild-type shape was indeed restored503020.01 .1 1GAj dosage (jig/plant)1025201510The leaflets of / plants are more oval and smaller thanthose of L plants (Fig. 1; Ross et al., 1990b).

The same was true for leaflet area ( e g  node 7, 0.3 r g  of GAl plant-' dose; Table I). However, at higher dosages and leaf number (eg. leaves 10 and ll), the leaflets of treated plants were actually of a more elongated, elliptical shape than untreated wild-type leaflets (Fig. l), and surface area, although increased compared with control plants, was considerably less than in the wild type (Table I). Both of these observations appear to be attributable to the reduction in leaflet width at higher GAl dosages, and the same reduc- tion in leaflet width probably accounts for the GAl-induced decrease in leaflet area in wild-type plants (Table I). In contrast, at nodes just above the application site, the leaflet width of I plants was actually increased by GAl application (0.3-, 1-, 5-, and 1O-Pg dosages, node 6; e.g. Table I). Application of CAI to I plants increased petiole length (Table I) and at higher doses resulted in a phenocopy of the wild type in this regard. Effect of Cenotype on GA Levels The young, expanding leaflets, petioles, and intemodes of L sweet peas contained higher levels of GAl, GAs, and GA19 than did the corresponding portions from I plants (Table 11). The opposite was true for GAZ0 and GA29 (Table 11). These results are consistent with those obtained previously (Ross et al., 1992b), in which apical portions were analyzed without separation into constituent portions. The level of GAsl (in relation to that of GA29) was generally low in this experiment, compared to previous findings (Ross et al., 1992b). G h 4  was a minor GA in a11 cases (as assessed by the degree of dilution of an intemal standard), rarely exceeding a level of 1 ng (g fresh weight)-' (data not shown). Effects of Plant Portion on CA Levels Within each genotype the levels of GAl and GAs did not vary markedly among the plant portions examined. In con- trast, within both genotypes there were large differences in the levels of GA19, GAZo, and GA29 among intemodes, pe- tioles, and leaflets (Table 11). For example, in L plants the level of GA19 was much greater in intemodes than in leaflets, and the reverse was true for GA20. Petioles contained inter- mediate levels of both GAs. GA19 was an abundant GA in L intemodes, second only to GA8 in level (Table 11). Within I plants a similar effect of plant part was apparent, but in this case the level of GA19 did not markedly exceed that of GAZo Table 111.

Despite the use of an intemal standard, no evidence was obtained for the presence of GA3 in any vege- tative tissue from either genotype. Effect of Ontogeny on GA Levels in the Apical Portion of Seedlings The apical portion of 20-d-old sweet pea seedlings, with six fully expanded leaves (including two scale leaves) con- tained approximately 10 times more GA1 and 7 to 8 times more GA20 than did the apical portion of 6-d-old seedlings, which were emerging from the soil at the time of harvest (Table 111). Emerging seedlings also contained less GAs and GA29 than did 20-d-old seedlings, but the differences in these cases were less than those for GAl and GA~o.  It is interesting that the difference in GA19 levels was smaller still; 6-d-old seedlings contained more than 50% the concentration of GA19 present in the older seedlings (Table 111). The intemodes and leaflets subsequently produced by accompanying unhar- vested plants are characterized by data shown in Table IV. The internodes immediately above the excision site were markedly shorter in plants at the younger ontogenetic stage than those of the older stage. Similarly, the first true foliage leaflets produced by the young seedlings were smaller and more oval than those produced at node 7 (i.e. above the excision site for the harvested 20-d-old plants). Effects of Tissue Maturity on GA Levels When sweet pea seedlings with nine fully expanded leaves were partitioned into the apical portion, leaflets at node 10, intemode 9 to 10, and leaflets and intemodes from the basal portion (Table V), GAZ0 and GA1 were found to be much more abundant in young tissue from the upper portion than in the lower, mature tissue.

DISCUSSION The level of GAI appears to play a regulatory role in the control of leaf growth in L. odoratus, as indicated by the following evidence. First, mutant allele 1 reduces the level of GAI in expanding leaves (Table 11) and affects leaflet shape and size (Table I; Ross et al., 1990b). Second, GAl application to I plants was able to substitute for gene L, in terms of leaf phenotype. At certain combinations of dose rate and node number, the wild-type leaflet shape was restored in 1 plants by exogenous GA1 (Fig. 4). At other nodes on the stem, the leaflet area of GAl-treated I plants was not significantly different from that of comparable wild-type (L) plants (Table I). Petiole length was also restored to the wild-type length by CAI application to 1 plants. Third, emerging seedlings of wild-type plants contained very little GAI and subsequently produced smaller and more oval leaflets than did older seed- lings (which possessed higher GAr levels). Thus, in the wild type, the level of GAI appears to increase with ontogeny (as in Pisum, Ross et al., 1992a), and it is suggested here that the changes in leaf size and shape and intemode length on ascension of the stem are attributable (at least in part) to an increase in GAI production as the seedling grows. Therefore, GAI appears to be a regulator of plant growth in sweet pea rather than merely a factor necessary for normal growth. Clearly, the level of GAI present in the wild type is necessary for the production of normal, wild-type leaflets. A deficiency of GAI, such as occurs in 1 plants, results in substantially shorter, slightly narrower, more oval leaflets of smaller surface area. On the other hand, when wild-type plants are treated with a large dose (e.g. 10 pg) of GA1 the resulting leaflets are slightly longer, markedly narrower (i.e. more elliptical), and smaller in surface area than untreated leaflets. It appears that a certain level of GA1 is necessary for maximum leaflet width in this species and that the concen- tration in the wild-type is probably close to this optimum level. The fact that in the I plants different doses of exogenous GAI are required for maximum leaflet length (approximately 0.3-1 p g )  and minimum leaflet width (approximately 5 p g )  indicates that the reduction in leaflet width may be a direct effect of GA1. The relative levels of GA19 and GAzO (the precursors of Table V.

The effect of organ type (e.g. leaflets compared with intemodes) was particularly marked. Although pool sizes may provide only indirect evidence regarding the rates of biosynthetic steps (Hedden and Croker, 1992), in sweet pea it appears likely that in young leaflets the GA19 to GAZO step proceeds more rapidly than in young intemodes, where GAI9 is a very abundant GA. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that in garden pea leaflets metabolized [3H2]GA~9 more rapidly than did stems (Smith, 1992). In both species, leaflets appear to contain much more GA20 than do stems (Table 11; Smith et al., 1992). The data presented here for sweet pea, however, differ from those of Smith et al. (1992), who found that leaves of wild-type peas contained more GA19 than did internodes. Smith (1992) has suggested that in peas GA19 is predominantly synthesized in young leaflets. However, the high level of GA19 found in both expanding and mature sweet pea stems (Tables II and V) indicates that either this conclusion does not apply in this species (and that GAI9 is synthesized in internodes as well) or that GA19 is efficiently transported from young leaves into the stem, where it accumulates. The results reported here are relevant to questions regarding the sites of GA biosynthesis and the biosynthetic steps regulated in this process. Given that GAI influences internode length (Ross et al., 1990a, 1990b) and leaf growth in sweet pea (this paper), it is important to understand more about the regulation of pool sizes of this plant hormone.
