A phytochemical study on an ethanol extract of Ardisia arborescens resulted in the isolation of five new
diarylundecanones, named ardisinones A-E (1-5). The structures were established by HRESIMS and
NMR (1H, 13C, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC) as 11-(2-acetoxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-
undecan-1-one (1), 11-(2-acetoxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)undecan-1-one (2),
1-(2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-11-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)undecan-1-one (3), 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-
11-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)undecan-1-one (4), and 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-11-(2-hydroxyphenyl)undecan-
1-one (5). In our in vitro disk diffusion assay, compounds 1 and 4 showed some slight inhibition of three
bacteria, while 2 and 3 did not show antimicrobial activity.
Ardisia arborescens Wall. Ex A. Dc (Myrsinaceae) is an
endemic herbaceous plant distributed in the southwest
region of the People’s Republic of China. It is used as a
febrifuge to relieve internal fevers.1 No previous phy-
tochemical investigation on this species has been con-
ducted. The medicinal uses of A. arborescens prompted us
to investigate polar components in the EtOH extract. Five
new closely related compounds (1-5), together with five
known compounds, 1-triacontanol,2 â-sitosterol,3 â-dauco-
sterol,3 urs-12-en-3â-ol,4 and succinic acid,5 were isolated.
The known compounds were identified on the basis of
spectral comparison with published data from the litera-
ture. Diarylnonoids are rare in nature,6 especially diaryl-
undecanones, which possess 11 carbon units between two
aromatic rings.7
The molecular formula (C25H32O7) of compound 1 was
obtained from the HRESIMS at m/z 445.2219 [M + H]+.
The FeCl3 positive reaction and the IR absorption at 3423
cm-1 confirmed the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups.
A bathochromic shift at 281 nm appearing in the UV
spectrum with the addition of base or aluminum trichlo-
ride, along with an IR absorption at 1630 cm-1, suggested
the presence of an ortho-hydroxycarbonyl-substituted aryl
ring.8 As evident from the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), the
five aromatic proton signals [ä 5.78 (2H, s), 6.67 (1H, dd,
J ) 8.0, 1.5 Hz), 6.97 (1H, m), and 6.46 (1H, dd, J ) 8.0,
1.5 Hz)] revealed the existence of two benzene rings, four
hydroxyl groups at ä 12.23 (2H, s), 10.31 (1H, s), and 9.53
(1H, s), one acetoxyl group [äH 2.24 (3H, s), äC 21.2
(OCOCH3) and 169.8 (OCOCH3)], and an aliphatic chain.
Since the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 1 were similar
to those of malabaricones,6 the presence of 10 methyleness
one flanking the carbonyl group [äH 2.95 (2H, t, J ) 7.4
Hz), äC 43.7], one benzylic [äH 2.37 (2H, t, J ) 7.4 Hz), äC
24.1], and eight others [äH 1.55 (2H, q, J ) 7.0 Hz), äH 1.24
(12H, overlapped), äH 1.37 (2H, m), äC 25.1, 29.1, 29.5, 29.6
(3C), 29.7 (2C)]swas inferred.6
All carbon and proton chemical shift assignments and
function group positions were obtained through analysis
of DEPT, HSQC, and HMBC experiments. The two protons
(äH 5.78 s, äC 95.3) assigned at 3′ and 5′ by HSQC
experiment were characteristic of a symmetrical 1′,2′,4′,6′-
tetrasubstituted aryl ring, the structure of which was
further confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-3′/C-1′,
C-2′, and C-4′ and of H-5′/C-1′, C-4′, and C-6′. The two
hydroxyls located at 2′ and 6′ were confirmed by the HMBC
correlations of OH-2′/C-1′, C-2′, and C-3′ and of OH-6′/C-
1′, C-5′, and C-6′. Since intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with the carbonyl carbon caused the downfield shift of two
hydroxyls at 2′ and 6′ rather than the hydroxyl at 4′, the
carbonyl carbon was positioned at position 1. Support for
this assignment was readily obtained from the EIMS
spectrum, which had prominent peaks resulting from
cleavage R to the carbonyl group at m/z 153 (trihydroxyl-
benzoyl ion) and a peak of high relative intensity at m/z
168 [C6H3(OH)3C(OH)dCH2]+.8 The coupling constants of
the aromatic protons in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested
the presence of a 1′′,2′′,6′′-trisubstituted benzene unit. The
carbon at ä 122 was established at C-1′′, as confirmed by
a long-range correlation of this carbon with the proton at
ä 2.37 attributed to H-11. The hydroxyl group at ä 9.53
was connected to C-6′′ by analysis of the HMBC correla-
tions with C-1′′ and C-6′′. The acetoxyl group was further
proved by the HMBC correlation between the carbonyl
carbon resonating at ä 169.8 and the proton at ä 2.24 (3H,
s). Thus, the structure of compound 1 was deduced to be
11-(2-acetoxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-
undecan-1-one.
The remaining four compounds had UV absorption and
1H and 13C resonances resembling those of 1 (Tables 1 and

2). It was apparent that they differed only in the substitu-
tions at the two benzene rings. The molecular formula of
C26H34O7 for ardisinone B (2) was confirmed by high-
resolution ESIMS. The 1H NMR spectrum differed from
that of ardisinone A (1) in having one less hydroxyl signal
at the tetrasubstituted aryl ring. Comparison of the 13C
NMR chemical shifts of 2 and 1 indicated the hydroxyl
group at C-4′ in 1 was substituted by a methoxyl group in
2, and the change of substitution induced the upfield shifts
of C-3′ and C-5′ of compound 2 compared with 1. Accord-
ingly, the structure of 2 was assigned as 11-(2-
acetoxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-
phenyl)undecan-1-one.
Ardisinone C (3), C24H32O6, had 1H and 13C NMR spectra
indicating the same features as 2 except for a hydroxyl (ä
8.91) instead of an acetoxyl group at 2′′ of the trisubstituted
benzene ring. The symmetrical substitutions at the trisub-
stituted aryl ring by hydroxyls at C-2′′ and C-6′′ and the
shifts of protons at C-3′′ and C-5′′ were identical, and the
proton at C-4′′ displayed one doublet instead of the mul-
tiplet of compound 2. Thus, compound 3 was established
as 1-(2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-11-(2,6-dihydroxy-
phenyl)undecan-1-one.
Ardisinone D (4), C23H30O6, possessed the same tetra-
substituted aryl ring as 1 and the same oxygenation
pattern of the trisubstituted ring as 3. Thus, compound 4
was characterized as 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-11-(2,6-
dihydroxyphenyl)undecan-1-one.
Ardisinone E (5), C23H30O5, showed 1H and 13C NMR
spectra similar to those of compound 4 at the tetrasubsti-
tuted aryl ring, although a hydroxyl signal less than
compound 4 at the other ring. Since there was only one
hydroxyl group signal at the other benzene ring, the
resonances for C-1′′, C-3′′, and C-5′′ in the 13C NMR shifted
downfield compared to compound 4. Therefore, the struc-
ture of compound 5 was 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-11-(2-
hydroxyphenyl)undecan-1-one.
HPLC analysis of compounds 3 and 4 in the ethanolic
extract was done to investigate whether compounds 3 and
4 were artifacts derived from compounds 1 and 2. The
components were identified by comparison of their reten-
tion times with those of external standards. The presence
of 3 and 4 in the chromatogram of the ethanolic extract
verified that they were not artifacts formed during the
isolation procedure.
Diarylundecanones have been reported to inhibit some
common microorganisms.9 Six microorganism species
(Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis,
Mycobacterium smegatis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus
niger) were evaluated for growth inhibition by ardisinones
A-D (1-4). Compounds 1 and 4 showed slight inhibition
of Gram-positive S. aureus and B. subtilis and were active
against M. smegatis, whereas compounds 2 and 3 were not
active.
Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were
determined on a XRC-1 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV
spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV/vis
spectrometer. IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer
Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer. 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra
were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 instrument. Chemical
shift values are in ppm (ä) with TMS as internal standard.
Column chromatography (CC) was carried out on silica gel
(200-300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Chemical Inc., China) and
polyamide (200 mesh, Linjiang Chemical Inc., Jiangsu, China).
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was per-
formed using a Perkin-Elmer series 200 pump equipped with
a Perkin-Elmer series 200 UV/vis detector. TLC was performed
on precoated plates (GF254, Qingdao Marine Chemical Inc.,
China) with the solvent system petroleum ether-Me2CO (3:
1) (a). MS were detected on a Bruker Dalonics Apex II mass
spectrometer (HRESIMS), a Finnigan LCQDECA (ESI), and a
VG7070E (EI).

Plant Material. A. arborescens was collected from Xishua-
ngbanna, Yunan Province, People’s Republic of China, in April
2001, and identified by Prof. Jing-yun Cui. A voucher specimen
(No. 20010401) was deposited in the herbarium of Chengdu
Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Bioassay. The in vitro disk diffusion assay to test anti-
microbial activity was conducted as previously described.10 Six
microorganism species (E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, M.
smegatis, C. albicans, A. niger) were evaluated for growth
inhibition by compounds 1-4. Each microorganism was grown
on an agar medium. Plates were inoculated by spreading the
spore or cell suspension evenly over the surface of the agar
medium to obtain confluent growth. The zone of inhibition at
each disk was measured at 24 and 48 h.
Extraction and Isolation. Dried and powdered A. arbore-
scens (3.5 kg) was extracted with 95% EtOH at room temper-
ature to give an extract (220 g), which was suspended in MeOH
(90%)-H2O (10%) and extracted with petroleum ether. Then
the MeOH fraction was evaporated under reduced pressure.
The residue suspended in H2O was extracted with EtOAc and
n-BuOH successively. The EtOAc extract (23 g) was separated
by CC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH (50:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1) to
yield four fractions. Fraction 1 was subjected to CC (silica gel,
petroleum ether-Me2CO, 5:1) to yield compound 2 (156 mg).
Fraction 2 on CC (silica gel, petroleum ether-Me2CO, 4:1) gave
compound 3 (134 mg). Compounds 1 (52 mg) and 5 (8 mg) were
obtained from fraction 3 by CC (silica gel, petroleum ether-
Me2CO, 5:2, 5:3). After separation on CC (silica gel, petroleum
ether-Me2CO, 3:1) and purification on CC (polyamide, CHCl3-
MeOH, 5:1) fraction 4 gave compound 4 (46 mg). Compound 5
was further purified by CC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH, 15:1).
