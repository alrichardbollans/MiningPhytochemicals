Das cascas do tronco e das folhas do Hymenodictyon floribundum B. L. Rob foram isolados dois 
novos iridoides, floribundano A (1) e floribundano B (2), e três compostos conhecidos, lupenona 
(3), escopoletina (4) e 4,5-di-hidroblumenol A (5). As estruturas de todos os compostos foram 
estabelecidas com base nos seus dados espectroscópicos.
Two new iridoids floribundane A (1) and floribundane B (2) and the known compounds 
lupenone (3), scopoletin (4) and 4,5-dihydroblumenol A (5) were isolated from trunk bark and 
leaves of Hymenodictyon floribundum B.L. Rob. The structures of all compounds were established 
from their spectroscopic data.
Keywords: Hymenodictyon floribundum, monoterpenes, secoiridoids, nitrogen-containing 
iridoid, C-9 iridoid
Introduction
The Hymenodictyon genus comprises 22 species. Of 
these, 11 are endemic to Madagascar, 4 to Asia and 7 to 
Tropical Africa.1 Hymenodictyon floribundum B.L. Rob. 
(Rubiaceae), endemic to Tropical Africa, is a small tree 
that grows in the mountains of the Huíla province and its 
traditional name is NDambi Yov`olwi, (omu)Lia-tyimeme. 
Its trunk bark is used in Angola folk medicine to treat fever.2
A previous study has shown that the trunk bark of this 
tree contains scopoletin, hymeselsin, scopolin and 3-O-β-
D-glucopyranosyl-β-sitosterol.3 An exhaustive literature 
review revealed that, with the exception of an ongoing study 
examining the trunk bark and dried leaves of Hymendictyon 
floribundum (in the context of other medicinal plants of 
Angola),4 other parts of the tree have not yet to be studied.
In the aforementioned study, powdered trunk barks and 
dried leaves were extracted by maceration with methanol. The 
methanol extract was partitioned with hexane and chloroform. 
The hexane extract from trunk barks yielded lupenone (3)5 
and the chloroform extract yielded scopoletin (4).6 The 
chloroform extract from dried leaves yielded floribundane 
A (1), 4,5-dihydroblumenol A (5)7,8 and floribundane B (2).
Results and Discussion
Floribundane A (1) was obtained as a colourless oil 
with [α]2D0 = +25.31º. The HR-TOF- EI-MS showed a 
molecular ion peak at m/z 223.0843 [M]+(in agreement 
with the molecular formula C11H13NO4) implying 6 
degrees of unsaturation. The UV maximum at 234 nm and 
the IR absorptions at 1724, 1633 and 1268 cm-1 suggested 
the presence of the chromophore -OOCC=CHO.9 The 
IR also showed the presence of a lactam ring: NH band 
(3403 cm-1), and the amide band I (1690 cm-1) with an 
absence of the amide II band.10 The 1H NMR spectrum of 
compound (1) (Table 1) displayed signals of two vinylic 
protons (H-3 dH 7.50, s and H-8 dH 6.85, q, J 7.2), a ABX 
system [H-6α,β dH 2.11, dd, J 13.1 and 2.0; dH 2.06, dd, 
J
 
13.1 and 2.6 (AB part) and H-5 dH 3.94, m (X part)] 
and a vinyl methyl group at dH 2.01 (d, J 7.2); typical 
signals of a secoiridoid nucleus.11 A few iridoid alkaloids 
have been isolated from natural sorces12-15 (gardenamide 
class), and some were obtained as metabolites produced 
by human16 and rat intestinal bacteria.17 Comparison with 
the published data of known iridoid alkaloids, such as (6) 
(Figure 1), and hemiacetal-secoiridoids11,18 like (7) (Figure 
1) and compound (1), showed that the H-3 chemical shift 
(dH 7.50 ppm), despite the presence of a nitrogen atom in 
Iridoids from Hymenodictyon floribundum J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1122
the molecule, was more compatible with the hemiacetal-
secoiridoids (dH ca.7.5 ppm) than with the gardenamide 
class and mor-117 (8) (Figure 1) (dH ca. 7.3 ppm). 
Further, the upfield shift of H-1 (dH 5.46) relative to 
the corresponding signal of mor-1 (dH 5.11 ppm),17 and 
a downfield shift (dH 5.94 ppm) to the corresponding 
hemicetals,11,18 showed that (1) it was neither a hemiacetal 
nor a nitrogen-containing iridoid (N-2) but that it was 
compatible with a C-1(N)O-2 substitution. This was 
also supported by the presence of the 1H-1H COSY 
correlation between H-1/NH, rather than the H-1/NH, 
H-3/NH correlations expected in the iridoid alkaloids,17 
and by UV and IR data indicating the presence of the 
chromophore -OOCC=CHO.9 The 13C NMR spectrum 
(Table 1) showed 11 carbons which were analysed as two 
methyls (one vinylic and a methyl ester), one methylene, 
four methines two of them vinylic, and four quaternary 
carbons (two vinylic and two carbonylic) from its DEPT 
spectrum. The 13C NMR chemical signals at dC 152.13 
(C-3), 136.11 (C-8), 130.25 (C-9), the carbonyl group at 
dC 166.56, the methoxy signal at dC 51.31 and the vinyl 
methyl group at dC 13.96, were found to be consistent 
with a secoiridoid skeleton.11 The unusual downfield shift 
of C-1 to dC 76.97 was in agreement with the C-1(O)
(N) substitution as observed on mor-1,17 but only the 
presence of O in the position 2 of the iridoid skeleton 
could explain the upfield shift of C-3 and C-4. The HMBC 
correlation between H-1/C-7 established the presence 
of the 1,7-d-lactam ring in the molecule. With the aid 
of 1H – 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC data (Table 1, 
Figure 2) it was possible to establish the structure of (1) 
as a 7,8-secoiridoid, with C-11 as a methyl ester, a C-1(N)
O-2 substitution and a 1,7-d-lactam ring. The NOESY 
correlations H
α
-5/ H
α
-6 and Hβ-6/Hβ-1 indicated that the 
1,7-d-lactam ring is trans-fused. To our best knowledge, 
this is the first time that a secoiridoid has presented as a 
1,7-trans-d-lactam ring. A similar structure, isosweroside, 
as a hemiacetal, was found in the roots of Sambucus ebulus 
L.19 Compound (1) was named floribundane A.
Floribundane B (2) was obtained as a colourless oil 
with [α]2D0 = + 41.66º. The molecular formula C9H14O3 was 
established by HR-TOF-MS-EI which showed a molecular 
ion peak at m/z 170.0942 [M]+ (calculated for 170.2270), 
implying 3 degrees of unsaturation. The IR showed OH 
bands (3384 cm-1), an α,β-unsaturated lactone group 
(1692 cm-1, 1620 cm-1); the UV spectrum a α,β-unsaturated 
lactone system (230 nm). The 1H RMN spectrum (Table 1) 
showed signals of one diastereotopic oxymethylene (H-3) 
dH 4.23 (ddd, J1 11.3, J2 9.1, J3 4.4 Hz) and dH 4.42 (ddd, 
J1 11.3, J2 9.5, J3 3.6 Hz) that presented 1H – 1H COSY 
correlation with a diastereotopic methylene (H-4) dH 1.83 
(m) and dH 2.12 (m); a oxymethylene multiplet dH 3.71 
(H-7) that presented an 1H – 1H COSY correlation with 
another methylene dH 1.74 (m, H-6); a methine dH 3.18 
(m, H-5) that showed cross peaks with H-4 and H-6 and a 
vinyl methine dH 7.02 (qd, J1 7.4, J2 1.2 Hz, H-8) coupled 
with a methyl dH 1.86 (d, J 7.4 Hz, Me-10). This spectrum 
presents some similarities to that of compound (1): the 
presence of the vinyl double bond and the 1H – 1H COSY 
correlations between H-5, H-6 and H-7. Thus, it appears

methylenes (two of them oxymethylenes, dC 27.51, 36.11, 
59.97, 65.35), two methines (one vinylic, dC 28.93, 140.67), 
and two quaternary carbons (one vinilyc, dC 131.16, and 
the other carbonylic, dC 167.38). The lack of the two 
quaternary sp2 carbons belonging to the C-3 - C-4 double 
bond of (1) and the methine C-1, and the presence of signals 
characteristic of a methylene (dC 27.51), a oxymethylene 
(dC 65.35) and a sp2 carbon (dC 167.38) belonging to the 
α,β-unsaturated lactone group detected in the IR and UV 
spectra, is indicative of a major transformation in the B 
ring of (2). However, these new features of the B ring 
are in good agreement with those of the d-lactone ring 
of C-9 iridoid derivatives viteoid II,20,21 7-hidroxyviteoid 
II22 and ovatolactone.23 The vinylic double bond can 
unambiguously be assigned to C-8 and C-9 and the lactone 
carbonyl to C-1, by means of 1H – 1H COSY, HSQC and 
HMBC data (Table 1, Figure 2). Several C-9 iridoid and 
secoiridoid (lactone ring opening) derivatives are known20-25 
but to our best knowledge this is the first time that a C-9 
7,8-secoiridoid derivative has been isolated. Thus, (2) was 
identified as a new natural product for which we propose 
the name floribundane B.
Conclusions
Although trunk bark components of H. floribundum 
have been well studied, there has as yet been no study 
which focuses solely on the leaves of this medicinal tree. 
The major compound trunk bark extract is scopoletin. The 
occurrence of iridoids has been observed for the first time 
in this genus. A new secoiridoid alkaloid, floribundane A, 
and a C-9 7,8-secoiridoid, floribundane B was isolated from 
the leaves of this tree. 
Experimental
General experimental procedures 
Opt i c a l  r o t a t i on s  we r e  ob t a i n ed  w i t h  a 
Bellingham+Stanley Ltd ADP 220 polarimeter. HREIMS 
measurements were carried out on a VG Autospec M 
and recorded at 70 eV. FTIR and UV spectra were 
measured in a Unicam Mattson 5000 FTIR and Unican 
Helios α respectively. NMR spectra were recorded in a 
Bruker Avance II, 600 MHz (1H NMR) and 150.9 MHz 
(13C NMR), in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are given in d ppm 
and are referenced to the residual CHCl3, 7.26 ppm for the 
1H and 77.0 ppm for 13C. Two-dimensional experiments 
were performed with standard Bruker software. Column 
chromatography was carried out on silica gel (silica gel 60 
(70-230 mesh), Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Plant material 
Leaves and bark of Hymenodictyon floribundum were 
collected in the waterfall at the Comuna da Huíla, Huíla 
province, Angola in July 2001. A voucher specimen (3668) 
has been deposit at the Lubango Herbarium, Angola. 
Extraction and isolation 
Powdered trunk bark (3 kg) was extracted with methanol 
for a week at room temperature. The methanol extract was 
partitioned between MeOH-H2O (5:1) and hexane yielding 
16.6 g of the hexane extract. The aq. methanolic fraction 
was concentrated, H2O added and extracted with chloroform 
to obtain the chloroform extract (36.8 g). A sample of the 
hexane extract (4.7 g) was fractionated in silica gel column 
with a hexane/EtOAc, EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH gradients. 
The fraction eluted with hexane/EtOAc (95:5) was separated 
in silica gel column with a hexane/EtOAc gradient to yield 
lupenone (3) (20.3 mg). From the chloroform extract and by 
crystallization scopoletin (4) (30 g) was isolated. 
Dried leaves (0.9 kg) were extracted with methanol 
for a week at room temperature. The methanol extract 
was partitioned between MeOH-H2O (5:1) and hexane 
yielding 34.02 g of the hexane extract. The aq. methanolic 
fraction was concentrated, H2O added and extracted with 
chloroform to obtain the chloroform extract (5.2 g). A 
sample of the chloroform extract (1.6 g) was fractionated 
in silica gel column with a hexane/EtOAc, EtOAc/CHCl3 
and EtOAc/MeOH gradients. Two fractions were eluted 
with EtOAc/CHCl3 (7:3) (fraction I and II). Fraction I was 
separated in silica gel column with CHCl3 and a CHCl3/
MeOH gradient to yield floribundane A (1) (10.2 mg) 
and 4,5-dihydroblumenol A (5) (5.6 mg). Fraction II was 
separated in silica gel column with CHCl3 and a CHCl3/
MeOH gradient to yield floribundane B (2) (7.8 mg).
