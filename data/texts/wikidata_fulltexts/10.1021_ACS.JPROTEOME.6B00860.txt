The 21 study of robust and accurate biomarkers for pulse dietary assessment has great 22 value for nutritional epidemiology regarding health benefits and their 23 mechanisms. To characterize the fingerprinting of dietary pulses (chickpeas, 24 lentils and beans), spot urine samples from a subcohort from the PREDIMED 25 study were stratified, using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Non-pulse 26 consumers (≤ 4 g/day of pulse intake) and habitual pulse consumers (≥ 25 27 g/day of pulse intake) were analysed using a 1H-NMR metabolomics approach 28 combined with multi- and univariate data analysis. Pulse consumption showed 29 differences through 16 metabolites coming from (i) choline metabolism, (ii) 30 protein-related compounds, and (iii) energy metabolism (including lower urinary 31 glucose). Stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to design a 32 combined model of pulse exposure, which resulted in glutamine, dimethylamine 33 and 3-methylhistidine. This model was evaluated by receiver operating 34 characteristic curve (AUC > 90% in both training and validation sets). The 35 application of NMR-based metabolomics to pulse exposure highlighted new 36 candidates for biomarkers of pulse consumption, the role of choline metabolism 37 and the impact on energy metabolism, generating new hypotheses on energy 38 modulation. Further intervention studies will confirm these findings. 39  40 Keywords 41 pulses, legumes, metabolomics, NMR, choline metabolism, energy, biomarkers, 42 ROC curve   43 3  1. Introduction 44 The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a dietary pattern characterized by a high intake 45 of vegetables, cereals, pulses, nuts, fish and olive oil, low intake of red meat 46 and processed meat products, and low to moderate consumption of poultry, 47 wine and dairy products.1 Moreover, the MD has been demonstrated to be 48 useful in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, obesity, inflammatory diseases, 49 cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and even cancer.2–5  50 One of the components of the MD is pulses, which constitute an excellent food, 51 providing protein, dietary fibre, many vitamins and minerals, as well as a great 52 variety of phytochemicals.6–8 Thus, they could contribute to the beneficial effects 53 reported for this dietary pattern.9 In addition, pulses are increasingly being 54 recognized for their role in promoting good health.6,10–12 Indeed, habitual pulse 55 consumption is included in the main dietary guidelines worldwide, including the 56 MD,13 the Dietary Guidelines for Americans14,15 and the Nordic Diet,16 among 57 others, and they are also advocated in view of their low environmental impact 58 compared with other protein sources.17 59 Metabolomics is a powerful tool for identifying food exposure biomarkers in 60 humans18 and provides new information on dietary components and dietary 61 patterns.19 In this regard, the evaluation of dietary exposure through a 62 combination of biomarkers enables a better understanding of compliance to a 63 dietary exposure.20 Moreover, little is known about the metabolome fingerprint 64 from legume consumption either individually or as a complex food group, with 65 only a few tentative biomarkers being described.21,22 66 4  Determining the changes in the urinary metabolome, new biomarkers of intake 67 and/or their effect may reveal potential modifications in diet-related physiology 68 both in healthy and diseased individuals.23 Furthermore, metabolomic 69 approaches have been proposed for evaluating the relationship between 70 nutrition and health status.24 In light of this connection, recent scientific 71 publications have pointed out the potential health benefits of legumes in chronic 72 diet-related diseases, such as CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.6,8,25,26 Thus 73 the application of nutrimetabolomics to a high-cardiovascular-risk population 74 could provide new insights into this potential relationship.  75 In the present work, we compared the metabolome profiles of reported pulse 76 consumption in a free-living population to find putative biomarkers reflecting 77 intake and/or effect of intake. Analysis of individuals under free-living conditions 78 enables more representative data to be obtained on the metabolome 79 fingerprints of pulse consumers. In light of this, a better understanding of the 80 specific role of pulse consumption in terms of health benefits, beyond their 81 excellent nutritional profile, is expected. Therefore, the aim of the present study 82 was to investigate dietary pulse fingerprinting in spot urine using an untargeted 83 1H-NMR metabolomic approach on a free-living subcohort from the PREDIMED 84 study. For this purpose, we mainly focused on urinary biomarkers of a complex 85 pulse exposure comprising chickpeas, lentils and beans in a combined urinary 86 biomarker model. 87  88 2. Material and methods 89 2.1. PREDIMED subcohort study  90 5  For the present study, a subsample of 50 participants from the PREDIMED 91 study (ISRCTN 35739639; http://www.predimed.org) was taken. The 92 PREDIMED study is a large, parallel-group, multicentre, randomized and 93 controlled clinical trial assessing the effects of an MD on the primary prevention 94 of CVD. The trial protocol was conducted according to the Declaration of 95 Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all the centres 96 involved. Briefly, free-living participants (55–80 years old) without CVD that 97 fulfilled at least one of the two following criteria – type 2 diabetes mellitus or 98 three or more major cardiovascular risk factors – were included for an MD 99 supplemented either with extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts.27 The exclusion 100 criteria were CVD, any severe chronic illness, drug or alcohol addiction, a 101 history of allergy, or intolerance to olive oil or nuts. The subcohort consisted of a 102 random sample of participants at high cardiovascular risk, recruited from the 103 Barcelona and Valencia PREDIMED centres. The PREDIMED study design and 104 137-item validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) used have been 105 reported elsewhere.28,29 Data reported from the FFQs included information on 106 total legume consumption, and disaggregated type of legume consumed. 107  108 2.2. Stratification of the study population 109 2.2.1. Defining potential consumers 110 Both the use of FFQs and the population stratification of a cohort of individuals 111 by consumption have demonstrated an effective approach for the study of 112 biomarkers of food consumption.30–32 Participants were classified into two levels 113 (consumers and non-consumers) of habitual intake of dietary pulse foods 114 6  (chickpeas, lentils or beans) based on the analysis of the validated FFQs 115 (Supporting Information, Table S1). Intake of pulses was calculated as the sum 116 of consumed chickpeas, lentils and beans. Non-pulse (NP) consumers were 117 defined as subjects with sporadic or non-consumption (≤ 4.00 g/day) of pulses. 118 Habitual pulse (HP) consumers were set at a consumption of ≥ 25.71 g/day, 119 regularly. In order to explore global pulse consumption, individuals that did not 120 consume the three kinds of pulses simultaneously were also excluded. 121 Additionally, the condition of sporadic or non-intake of peas (≤ 4 g/day) was 122 taken into consideration, since the features of this type of legume are not similar 123 to the others.33 No other legume types were considered.  124  125 2.2.2. Selecting individuals by consumption 126 Spot urine samples were matched to corresponding individual FFQ data. From 127 a cohort of 828 individuals, 25 subjects were deﬁned as NP consumers and 37 128 as HP consumers (none of the other participants from both pulse consumer 129 groups fulfilled any criteria). In order to reduce the potential sources of 130 variability not related to pulse exposure, the number of HP consumers was 131 balanced against NP consumers (HP = 25, NP = 25). Finally, dietary data, 132 anthropometry, biochemical parameters, health status and medication were 133 explored with a view to discarding any variability unrelated to pulse 134 consumption. 135  136 2.3. Metabolomics analysis 137 7  2.3.1. Urine sample analysis and data processing  138 Morning fasting spot urine samples were collected, aliquoted, encoded and 139 frozen at -80 ºC until were use. Sample preparation was based on the 140 methodology previously published.19 The 1H-NMR urinary spectra were 141 acquired using a Varian-Inova-500 MHz NMR spectrometer with presaturation 142 of the water resonance using a NOESYPRESAT pulse sequence. During the 143 acquisition, the internal temperature was kept constant at 298 K. An exponential 144 window function was applied to the free induction decay (FID) with a line-145 broadening factor of 0.3 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. For each sample, a 146 total of 128 scans were collected into 32 K data points with a spectral width of 147 14 ppm at 300 K, an acquisition time of 3.2 s and a relaxation delay of 3 s.  148 1H-NMR spectra were phased, baseline-corrected and calibrated (TSP, 0.0 149 ppm) using TopSpin software (version 3.0, Bruker, BioSpin, Germany). After 150 baseline correction, original spectral data were bucketed in intelligent bucketing 151 domains of 0.005 ppm with ACD/NMR Processor 12.0 software (Advanced 152 Chemistry Development, Toronto, Canada). The water signal and noise regions 153 above 9.5 ppm and below 0.5 ppm were excluded from the analysis. 154 Data were submitted to MetaboAnalyst 3.0 for interquartile range filtering and 155 normalization by the sum of the intensities of the spectra.34 156  157 2.3.2. Statistical analysis 158 The NMR data set was log-transformed, Pareto-scaled and posteriorly analysed 159 in a multivariate approach using SIMCA-P+13.0 software (Umetrics, Umeå, 160 8  Sweden). Interindividual variation may confuse the effects of intervention, 161 particularly in multivariate data of high dimensionality. Therefore, partial least 162 squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction (OSC-PLS-DA) 163 was used to explore the differences in metabolomes among the pulse 164 consumption.35 OSC filtration was used to reduce the variability not associated 165 with dietary classification, as has been done in other published 166 nutrimetabolomic studies.19,31,36 The quality of the models was evaluated by the 167 proportion of the variance of the response variable that is explained by the 168 model (R2Y) and the predictive ability (Q2) parameters.35 Validation of the 169 models and the evaluation of the degree of overfitting were carried out using a 170 permutation test (n = 200), and the correlation coefficient between the original Y 171 and the permuted Y plotted against the cumulative R2 and Q2 was calculated. 172 Those NMR signals with variable importance for projection (VIP) values ≥1 in 173 the component of the OSC-PLS-DA model were selected as being relevant for 174 explaining the differences in metabolic profiles. These variables were further 175 studied through the univariate Student’s t-test among HP and NP consumers to 176 assess the statistical significances. Multiple tests were controlled by the false 177 discovery rate (FDR). Statistical significance was considered at an FDR-178 adjusted p-value <0.05. Then, Cliff's delta was chosen for estimation of the 179 effect size37 and calculated for each feature. 180  181 2.3.3. Metabolite identification 182 Metabolite identification was performed using the Chenomx NMR Suite 183 Professional Software package (version 8.1; Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, 184 9  Canada) and by comparing NMR spectral data to those available in databases 185 such as the Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca), the Biological 186 Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) and the Madison 187 Metabolomics Consortium Database (www.mmcd.nmrfam.wisc.edu), along with 188 the existing NMR-based metabolomics literature. Further, a Pearson’s 189 correlation test and clustering analysis with Pearson distance and Ward’s 190 minimum variance using PermutMatrix 1.9.3.0 software38 were applied in order 191 to identify the signals corresponding to the same metabolite. 192  193 2.4. Study of combined urinary biomarker model 194 The interaction between gender and the resulting metabolites was evaluated by 195 a logistic regression for discarding any effect on the biomarkers. Then, these 196 metabolites were submitted to a stepwise logistic regression analysis (IBM 197 SPSS Statistics 20 software, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to evaluate whether 198 the combination of more than one biomarker improves the discrimination20 of 199 pulse consumption. The models were constructed through a dichotomous 200 variable of pulse consumption as dependent variable and identified metabolites 201 as independent variables, with a p-value of <0.05 as a condition required for 202 entering and remaining in the model. For validation of models, the analysis with 203 a training set of 2/3 of the samples (removing 1/3 of the individuals as the 204 validation set) was permuted 20 times. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 205 was used to assess correlations between the combined models and pulse 206 consumption. 207 10  The global performance of the models was evaluated by receiver operating 208 characteristic (ROC) curve and estimation of the area under the curve (AUC) 209 values. The optimum cut-off for sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers was 210 determined as the minimum distance to the top-left corner.39  211  212 3. Results 213 A flow chart of the participants allocated in the present study is presented in the 214 Supplementary Information (Figure S1). Anthropometric measurements and 215 biochemical analyses were performed using standardized methods.28 HP 216 consumers showed a pulse consumption of 38.45 ± 14.68 g/day, while NP 217 consumers reported a consumption of 3.75 ± 3.95 g/day (mean ± SD). The 218 characteristics of participants classified by pulse consumption (Table S2) are 219 presented in the Supplementary Information. The stratified populations were not 220 different in terms of disease (type 2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular risk 221 factors), medications or biochemical parameters, among other data. Subjects 222 who were HP consumers showed higher amounts of both dietary fibre (p < 223 0.01) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (p < 0.05) intakes as a consequence of 224 legume macronutrient composition.6,40 No significances other than pulses were 225 found with regard to food intake. 226  227 3.1. Selection of significant biomarkers related to pulse consumption 228 For the analysis of the features belonging to pulse consumption in the urinary 229 metabolome of the HP and NP consumers, an orthogonal signal correction was 230 applied before PLS-DA analysis. The OSC-PLS-DA analysis of the two groups 231 11  resulted in a latent variable model with R2Y and Q2 values of 0.954 and 0.809, 232 respectively, indicating that the model was able to classify each subject in the 233 correct consumption group. The corresponding permutation tests showed 234 negative Q2 intercepts with a value of -0.164, implicating validation of the 235 model.35 With the purpose of selecting the most discriminative urinary markers 236 of consumption, only the statistically significant variables coming from both 237 multi- and univariate analyses simultaneously were considered. 238  239 3.2. Identified biomarkers of habitual pulse consumption 240 A total of 16 compounds were identified as discriminant metabolites of pulse 241 consumption. Metabolites and chemical shifts identified corresponding to 242 statistical analyses are presented in Table 1. The total number of metabolites 243 related to pulse consumption was divided into categories as follows: (i) choline 244 metabolism: choline, dimethylglycine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and 245 dimethylamine; (ii) protein-related compounds: 3-methylhistidine, 246 methylguanidine, phenylalanine, glutamine and n-acetylglutamine; and (iii) 247 energy metabolism: glucose, leucine, isovalerylglycine, and isobutyric, 248 acetoacetic, citric and cis-aconitic acids. 249  250 3.3. Combined urinary biomarker approach 251 Logistic regression analysis revealed that there was no significant interaction 252 between gender and the metabolites (p>0.05; all) shown in Table S3 253 (Supplementary Information). To study the improvement of the discrimination 254 12  between groups (HP and NP consumers), a conditional stepwise variable 255 selection method, through a binary logistic regression analysis, was used on a 256 combination of more than one discriminant metabolite. Table S4 257 (Supplementary Information) shows the resulting metabolites included in all 20 258 permuted models and the contribution to the model. Three metabolites were 259 included in the fitted model according to the maximum AUC, which contained 260 two protein-related metabolites (glutamine and 3-methylhistidine) and one 261 choline-related metabolite (dimethylamine). These three metabolites correlated 262 individually with the pulse consumption. However, the combined model 263 exhibited the strongest correlation (r=0.73, p<0.01) with the pulse exposure, as 264 shown in Table S5 (Supplementary Information). 265 The ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the combined metabolite model 266 and their metabolites using both training and validation sets separately. The 267 highest AUC was for the combined metabolite model for both training (AUC = 268 95.6%) and validation (AUC = 94.4%) sets, including glutamine, 3-269 methylhistidine and dimethylamine followed by the individual metabolites 3-270 methylhistidine (AUC = 82.4%), glutamine (AUC = 81.6%) and dimethylamine 271 (AUC = 75.0%), as shown in Figure 1. The equations generated from the 272 logistic regression and the AUCs from the models with their sensitivity and 273 specificity are shown in Table 2. 274 13   275 Figure 1.

Discussion 280 In this study, we present a panel of different urinary metabolites related to 281 habitual pulse exposure using a 1H-NMR-based untargeted nutrimetabolomic 282 approach in a free-living population. In addition, high correlations were found 283 when the exposure was assessed as a continuous variable (defined by the 284 combined biomarker panel).  285  286 4.1. Characterization of pulse fingerprinting in urine 287 4.1.1. Pulse metabolomic fingerprinting and choline metabolism  288 Several compounds found in the spot urine of pulse consumers are related to 289 choline. Thus pulses, as a rich source of choline,41 may be the precursor of 290 14  additional metabolites that are susceptible to microbial degradation generating 291 new compounds.42 Therefore, the increase of several intermediates of choline 292 metabolism, such as choline itself, TMAO and dimethylamine, appears to be a 293 consequence of the microbial activity in HP consumers. In relation to this, De 294 Filippis and co-workers found an inverse correlation between urinary TMAO and 295 vegetarian diets compared with omnivore ones. However, they suggest different 296 food sources of carnitine and choline such as eggs, beef, pork and fish.43 297 Hence, legumes from vegetarian diets should be proposed as a food choline 298 source. The increase of dimethylamine, which is also a downstream product of 299 choline, supports the microbial degradation of TMAO from choline. Furthermore, 300 TMAO was identified as a major source of urinary dimethylamine in humans,44 301 directly related to gut microbiota metabolism.45 On the other hand, the increase 302 of urinary dimethylglycine may also come from the choline contained in pulses. 303 The enzymes choline dehydrogenase, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase and 304 betaine homocysteine methyltransferase lead to dimethylglycine from choline.46 305 Therefore, the results of the present study suggest a possible impact on urinary 306 metabolome by choline from pulses that is degraded via both (i) mammalian 307 pathways in which choline is converted to dimethylglycine through betaine, and 308 (ii) microbial metabolism in which choline is degraded to trimethylamine, TMAO 309 and dimethylamine. For this reason, we propose dimethylamine and 310 dimethylglycine in spot urine as potential candidates for biomarkers of pulse 311 consumption. Nevertheless, these choline-related metabolites need to be 312 further explored in controlled studies confirming that they are food intake 313 biomarkers instead of reflecting metabolic differences due to the pulse 314 15  consumption. Figure 2 shows both proposed pathways for downstream 315 products of choline.  316  317  318 Figure 2.

Copyright 2016.  321  322 4.1.2. Pulse metabolomic fingerprinting and protein-related compounds 323 With regard to the increases in glutamine and the acetylated form n-324 acetylglutamine, several explanations may be proposed. Glutamine and n-325 acetylglutamine could come from dietary sources since glutamine is found in 326 high-protein foods, such as pulses.47 Another explanation could be the 327 alteration of urinary levels previously shown in this type of population,48 affected 328 by pulse consumption. There was a higher excretion of 3-methylhistidine in HP 329 consumers. This metabolite is a biomarker of meat and fish consumption,49 330 denoting a potential role as a biomarker of consumption. Interestingly, all food 331 sources of this metabolite are also protein sources, including pulses as a 332 16  vegetable source, as highlighted in the present study. However, 3-333 methylhistidine is also a muscle protein breakdown that is sensitive to gender 334 and age.50 Methylguanidine is derived from protein catabolism and from the 335 breakdown of creatinine,51,52 therefore it may be related to protein from pulses. 336  337 4.1.3. Pulse metabolomic fingerprinting and energy metabolism  338 The signals of several usual metabolites were altered between the two groups. 339 However, the definition as food intake biomarkers is controversial. Instead, they 340 probably reflect metabolic differences associated with being a low and high 341 consumer, based on the study design. Most of the biomarkers found in the 342 present study are metabolites related to energy metabolism. The lower 343 excretion of acetoacetic acid, glucose and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle 344 intermediates (citric and cis-aconitic acids) appears to involve a different energy 345 modulation according to the pulse consumption. This fact is in part reinforced by 346 changes in BCAAs and subproducts, which are involved in energy metabolism. 347 For example, isobutyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid that is a product of BCAA 348 catabolism of valine, which is a glucogenic BCAA metabolized via the 349 methylmalonyl-CoA in the TCA cycle.53 On the other hand, acetoacetic acid is a 350 ketone body produced in the human liver for fatty acid breakdown,54 which 351 serves as a source of energy when normal glycolysis is altered. Interestingly, 352 acetoacetic acid was shown to be increased in diabetes mellitus.55 Hence, we 353 hypothesize that gluconeogenesis may be diminished in pulse consumers, 354 supported by the urinary reduction of acetoacetic and isobutyric acids (lower 355 fatty acid catabolism), and the reduction of TCA cycle intermediates and urinary 356 17  glucose (better use of glucose). Furthermore, it was observed that pulse 357 consumption has a glucose-lowering role in diabetes mellitus,56,57 thereby 358 explaining the lower plasma glucose concentration and lower urinary excretion. 359 Figure 3 shows the resulting endogenous metabolites connected to the TCA 360 cycle. Nevertheless, the small sample size that resulted after the stratification of 361 the population leads to only exploratory results that should be confirmed. 362 The role of other findings such as increases of leucine and phenylalanine in 363 pulse consumers is unclear. On the one hand, these habitual urinary 364 compounds could be increased as a consequence of pulses being the source. 365 However, another explanation of these findings could support the hypothesis 366 above. Leucine, which is an acetoacetic acid precursor, may modulate glucose 367 metabolism through oxidation, as well as insulin signalling and release. In 368 addition, stimulation of glucose recycling via the glucose-alanine cycle by 369 leucine may inhibit protein breakdown.58,59 However, alterations in urinary 370 leucine have also been proposed for the prediction of diabetes mellitus, 371 probably related to the perturbed energy metabolism.55 The origin of increased 372 phenylalanine is also uncertain. This ketogenic amino acid can stimulate insulin 373 and glucagon concentration, enhancing glucose homeostasis,60 and is also 374 altered in an insulin-resistant state and obesity.61 Overall, the consumption of 375 pulses seems to affect the energy metabolism in the studied population. 376  377 18   378 Figure 3. Modified metabolites found in HP consumers connected to energy 379 metabolism. 380  381 4.2. New biomarker panel to characterize habitual pulse consumption 382 To delimit the prediction of habitual pulse intake, comprising lentils, chickpeas 383 and beans, a combination of more than one discriminatory metabolite had to be 384 studied. The combination of three metabolites enhanced considerably the AUC 385 and the confidence interval of the model in comparison with individual 386 metabolites, as shown in Table 2. The developed model indicated that 387 glutamine, 3-methylhistidine and dimethylamine were the strongest candidates 388 for exposure biomarkers. It is important to note that the role of the component 389 coming from choline metabolism suggests the importance of this metabolite as 390 a biomarker of intake. Interestingly, metabolites displaying changes in energy 391 metabolism were scarcely considered by the stepwise logistic regression. None 392 of the other metabolites entered the model, probably as a result of collinearity in 393 the evidence provided by these compounds, which may originate from the same 394 19  metabolic pathways, giving similar biological or dietary information.36 Instead, 395 two metabolites related to protein coming from pulses and one connected to 396 microbiota choline degradation were established in the combined metabolite 397 model, giving complementary information, showing a better discrimination (AUC 398 > 90% in both training and validation sets) than each metabolite individually 399 (AUC < 90% in all cases), and reinforcing the improved capacity of biomarker 400 patterns to distinguish between different dietary exposures.  401  402 5. Conclusions 403 We applied an untargeted 1H-NMR-based metabolomic strategy to distinguish 404 the urinary metabolome of habitual pulse consumption in a free-living 405 population. Stepwise logistic regression analysis exhibited a useful approach to 406 designing a combined urinary biomarker model taking into consideration the 407 different characteristics of pulses. With regard to food metabolome, this study 408 points to a central role of choline contained in pulses and breakdown products 409 such as dimethylglycine, TMAO and dimethylamine. Protein-related compounds 410 such as glutamine, 3-methylhistidine and methylguanidine were also increased 411 in the urine of HP consumers. The combined metabolite model indicated that 412 dimethylamine, 3-methylhistidine and glutamine were the strongest candidates 413 for exposure prediction. In relation to energy metabolism, numerous compounds 414 connected to the TCA cycle, including BCAAs and acetoacetic acid, were 415 modified, denoting a substantial impact on energy metabolism modulation and 416 on urinary glucose in this population. However, since the status of type 2 417 diabetes mellitus or three or more major cardiovascular risk factors in the 418 20  studied population could have a distinctive energy modulation, properly 419 controlled interventions could confirm the findings observed in this cross-420 sectional study.  421  422 6.
