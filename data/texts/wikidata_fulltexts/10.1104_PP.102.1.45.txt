Plant Physiol. (1993) 102: 45-51 Effect of lntracellular Glutathione Leve1 on the Production of 6-Methoxymellein in Cultured Carrot (Daucus carota) Cells Ze-jian Cuo*, Shunji Nakagawara, Kuniko Sumitani, and Yoshimoto Ohta Yamazaki Laboratory, PCC Technology Inc., 1-1 -1 Wakayamadai, Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka 618, Japan To produce phytoalexin, 6-methoxymellein (6-MM) was induced in suspension cultures of carrot (Daucus carota) by buthionine sul- foximine (BSO) and CuCIz. Addition of BSO (a specific inhibitor of glutathione [CSH] synthesis) to the cultures lowered the cellular CSH levels. This depletion of CSH was BSO-concentration depend- ent, and the extent of 6 -MM accumulation was dependent on the CSH depletion. l h e  accumulation of 6 -MM induced by BSO was suppressed by exogenous CSH. Exogenous HzOz stimulated the production of 6 -MM when added 1 d after BSO treatment, whereas HzO2 added at time zero or on the 4th d of BSO treatment did not. Moreover, a synergistic effect of simultaneous addition of BSO and CuClz was observed. These results suggest that .active oxygen species may be involved in the triggering of 6 -MM synthesis. One important defense mechanism against microbial in- vasion in many plants is the production of phytoalexins, which are low-mol-wt secondary metabolites with antimicro- bial activities. The accumulation of phytoalexins in plants and also in cultured cells of the plants is induced by a wide range of exogenous agents called elicitors. For example, ac- cumulation of a carrot (Daucus carota) phytoalexin, 6-MM, was induced in the suspension culture of carrot upon infec- tion by Chaetomium globosuni or treatments with pectinase (Kurosaki and Nishi, 1983, 1984), endopolygalacturonase from Fusarium moniliforme (Marinelli et al., 1991), oligosac- charides from carrot cell wall (Kurosaki and Nishi, 1983), and abiotic elicitors such as heavy metals (Marinelli et al., 1991). Because a variety of substances with diverse chemical natures triggers phytoalexin biosynthesis in plant tissues, it has been suggested that second messengers, or some factors with a similar function, may participate in the induction of phyto- alexin production. However, the intracellular signaling events are still poorly understood. It is well known that elicitors induce various membrane- associated events, such as a depolarization of the membrane (Pelissier et al., 1986; Meyer and Ziegler, 1988), alterations of ion fluxes (Young et al., 1982; Atkinson et al., 1985), and an increase in lipid peroxidation (Rogers et al., 1988; Peever and Higgins, 1989). Recent evidence indicates the involve- ment of active oxygen species, such as H202, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical, in the early stages of a hyper- sensitive reaction and elicitation (Epperlin et al., 1986; Doke and Ohashi, 1988; Apostol et al., 1989; Schwache and Hager, 1992; Vera-Estrella et al., 1992). A possible role of active oxygen species in the transduction of an elicitor signal has been postulated in funga1 elicitor-treated soybean cells (Ap- ostol et al., 1989): The active oxygen species are deleterious to plant cells and are scavenged by enzymes, such as catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase, and also by antioxidants, such as GSH, in the cells. Elevation of the level of GSH (reduced form) in elicitor-treated cells (Edwards et al., 1991; Nakaga- wara et al., 1993) may be an indication of its protective role in preventing the accumulation of active oxygen species directly or indirectly in cooperation with appropriate en- zymes. This may inevitably accompany the interruption of transduction of elicitor signal resulting, for example, in the termination of phytoalexin synthesis (Apostol et al., 1989). According to this hypothesis, the cellular capacity to scavenge the active oxygen species could be altered by lowering the GSH level, and the production of a phytoalexin would be induced in the cells without elicitor treatment or it would be enhanced in elicitor-treated cells. In this report, we examine the effect of BSO, a specific inhibitor of y-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2) (Griffith and Meister, 1979; Reese and Wagner, 1987), on the production of 6-MM in carrot suspension-cultured cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals 8-Hydroxypyrene- 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (pyr- anine) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). L-Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine was from Sigma. Catalase (EC 1.1 1.1.6) from bovine liver and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) from horseradish were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).

The flasks were agitated on a gyratory shaker (110 rpm) at 24OC in continuous light. The cells were sub- cultured every 2 weeks. Production and Determination of 6-MM BSO, GSH, CuC12, and H202 were dissolved in the fresh culture medium, and the pH values of the solutions were adjusted to 5.4. A11 solutions were sterilized by filtration through Millipore filters (Millex GV, 0.22 pm) before addition to the cell-suspension culture. As a control, suspension cul- tures were treated with equal volumes of fresh culture me- dium (pH 5.4). After incubation for the designated period, the accumulated 6-MM in the cells and the culture medium were determined separately. Cells were harvested by filtra- tion and extracted with ethyl acetate for 4 h at room temper- ature. The extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, evaporated to dryness, and then redissolved in a fixed volume of ethyl acetate for 6-MM determination. 6-MM in the culture medium was determined directly after the medium was fil- tered through a Millipore filter (Columngard HV-13, 0.45 pm). The quantitative estimation of 6-MM was carried out by HPLC using a reverse-phase Cls column (Cica-Merck; LichroCART 250 X 4 mm) with 45% (v/v) acetonitrile/water as eluant at a flow rate of 1 mL min-'. The detection of 6- MM was performed with a fluorescence monitor (Shimadzu, RF-535) set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 270 and 454 nm, respectively. A standard sample of 6-MM was kindly provided by Dr. F. Kurosaki. Determination of GSH The cells to be assayed for GSH were collected by filtration and then frozen and stored at -7OOC until use. GSH was extracted into 0.5 mL of sulfosalicyclic acid ( l O % ,  w/v) with sonication for 30 s while cooled in an ice-water bath. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm X 10 min), the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore filter (Columngard-LCR4, 0.5 pm) before analysis. The method for GSH determination was essentially the same as described by Mendum et al. (1990). Briefly, GSH was first separated by HPLC on a RI'-18 column (LiChroCART, 250 x 4 mm) with a gradient elution system of acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 1 mL min-'. The solvent program was water containing 0.1% TFA for 4 min, with a linear increase of acetonitrile to 10% over 10 min and from 10 to 50% acetonitrile over 10 min. The quantification of the eluted GSH was carried out by a postcol- umn reaction with Ellman's.reagent, 75 pm 5,5'-dithiobis(2- nitrobenzoic acid) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) on a SynChropak PCR column (400 X 4 mm) monitored at 412 nm. Determination of HzOz The assay was carried out according to the method de- scribed by Aposto1 et al. (1989). The cells, incubated with or without BSO (2 mM), were washed twice with wash medium, centrifuged (1000 rpm x 2 min), and resuspended in the same medium. The wash medium contained 2% (w/v) SUC, the macro inorganic salts of Murashige-Skoog medium, and 20 r n ~  Mes adjusted to pH 5.6. The cell suspension was transferred to a 10-mL test tube and allowed to equili- brate for 15 min on a test-tube rotator. A 1.5-mL aliquot of the cell suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette, and 5 pL of pyranine (100 p g  mL-' in distilled water) was added with gentle stirring. The quenching of fluorescence of pyra- nine at 512 nm (excitation 405 nm) was monitored on a recording fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu, RF-5000 Spectrofluorophotometer). Determination of Cell Viability Viability of carrot cells was determined by counting the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent cells after incubation with fluorescein diacetate as described by Widholm (1972). RESULTS lnduction of 6-MM Production with BSO Cell-suspension cultures of carrot at different growth stages produced different amounts of 6-MM upon treatment with BSO (2 m). The level of production of 6-MM in the medium was at a maximum in cells at the early stationary phase (10 d old). This result was similar to that reported by Kurosaki et al. (1985). Therefore, 10-d-old cells were used in the rest of the experiments. Because 6-MM was found in the medium as well as in the cells, its amount in each fraction was determined independ- ently after separation by filtration in the following experi- ment. When the cell culture was treated with a low level of BSO (0.2 mM), only a small amount of 6-MM accumulated in both the medium and the cells throughout the incubation period (Fig. 1). At a higher concentration of BSO (2 or 4 mM), 6-MM started to accumulate in the medium after a lag of 3 d, reached a level of about 8 mg L-' of 6-MM after 1 week, and remained at this high level at least for another 3 d (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern of 6-MM accumulation was also ob- served in the case of the cells (Fig. 1B). It can be calculated from the fresh weight of cells (about 10 g) and the medium per flask that nearly two-thirds of the 6-MM produced was excreted into the medium. This ratio of 6-MM in the cells and the medium was fairly constant throughout the experi- ment. The viability of cells was greater than 90% even in the presence of 4 mM of BSO for up to 2 d. Effect of BSO on GSH Concentration in the Cells Figure 2 shows time courses of the change in the amount of GSH in cells treated with various concentrations of BSO. When the cells were treated with BSO at concentrations higher than 1 mM, the amount of intracellular GSH decreased rapidly to only about 5% of that in the control cells within 3 d, and this low GSH level was maintained for the rest of the experiment period. The GSH level also decreased similarly during the 1st d after addition of 0.2 mM of BSO but remained at about one-third of that in the control cells thereafter.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Thus, a series of experiments were conducted to test for generation of H202 by the cells treated with BSO. Formation of H202 by the carrot cells incubated for 3 d with or without BSO (2 m) was monitored by measuring the quenching of pyranine fluorescence during the 10-min period after addition of pyr- anine. BSO alone did not induce detectable fluorescence quenching in the absence of the cells. Control cells without BSO treatment exhibited a slight decline ir, the fluorescence. In contrast, a gradual but considerable quenching of pyr- anine fluorescence was observed in BSO-treated cells. This quenching reaction was completely obliterated by 0.1 mg mL-' of catalase, whereas 0.1 mg mL of superoxide dis- mutase had no effect. These results demonstrate that the quenching of pyranine fluorescence induced by BSO-treated carrot cells was due to the accumulation of H202. The degree of this H20z-mediated modification of pyranine was com- parable to that achieved by the addition of about 0.15 mM H202 to the cells without BSO treatment. The rate of H202 accumulation by the cells incubated with BSO for 1 d was very low and similar to that observed in the control cells. Effect of BSO on Elicitation of 6-MM Production by Elicitors and CSH Because the above results suggest that the induction of 6- MM formation in BSO-treated carrot cells is closely related to the depletion of intracellular GSH and to the generation of oxidative stress due to H202, we decided to examine the production of 6-MM by elicitors and GSH in the presence of BSO. First, H202 was used as an elicitor. H202 (1 mM) was added to the carrot cell suspensions incubated with BSO (3 mM) for different periods, and the contents of 6-MM in the medium were measured at the times indicated in Figure 3. When H202 was added to the cells 1 d after they were treated with BSO, 6-MM production was stimulated and the maximal accumu- lation of 6-MM was much higher than in the case of cells treated with BSO alone. When H202 was added to the cells 4 d after BSO treatment, 6-MM accumulation in the medium was slightly suppressed. When H202 and BSO were admin- istrated simultaneously, the time course of 6-MM accumula- tion was very similar to the result obtained by the treatment with BSO alone. In addition, only a very small amount of 6- MM was induced by the addition of H202 alone. In the next phase of the experiment, the effect of GSH addition to cells incubated in the presence of BSO for various periods of time was examined (Fig. 4). GSH (1 mM) treatment alone at time zero did not lead to the induction of 6-MM production.

Therefore, the addition of GSH at these times effectively blocked the inductive effect observed with BSO was applied alone. Addition of GSH on the 4th d after treatment with BSO only further suppressed accumu- lation of 6-MM. Finally, the time courses of 6-MM formation in suspension- cultured carrot cells treated with CuC12 alone at a concentra- tion of 0.2 mM or together with BSO (0.2 or 1 mM) are shown in Figure 5A. CuC12 alone elicited the production of a small amount of 6-MM, and this was strongly enhanced by the presence of a low concentration of BSO (0.2 mM). BSO itself at this low concentration induced the accumulation of only a negligible amount of 6-MM in the medium (Fig. 5A). How- ever, this synergism could not be further amplified and was even suppressed at a higher dose of 1 mM of BSO (Fig. 5A). BSO alone at 1 mM induced the formation of more than twice the amount of 6-MM that was induced by BSO (0.2 or 1 mM) plus 0.2 mM CuC12.

In the presence of both CuC12 and BSO, the GSH content decreased abruptly to the minimum level within 24 h. DISCUSSION We have shown that reduction of GSH levels with BSO leads to increased oxidative stress, which eventually induces a gradual but considerable accumulation of 6-MM in carrot cells. Although the involvement of active oxygen species in signal transduction of elicitation has been documented, this is, to our knowledge the first report to demonstrate that production of phytoalexin can be induced by altering the cellular redox states. BSO, a specific inhibitor of y-glutamyl- cysteine synthetase in animals (Griffith and Meister, 1979), has been shown to be similarly effective in plant cells (Earn- shaw and Johnson, 1985; Reese and Wagner, 1987). This was also the case for cultured carrot cells used in this experiment. The depletion of GSH caused by the treatment of BSO did not produce an appreciable change in the viability of plant cells as confirmed in this study as well as by Earnshaw and Johnson (1985) and in a study in which suspension-cultured cells of a liverwort, Marchaiztia polymorpha, were used (Y. Ohta, unpublished results). As shown in Figure lA, the production of 6-MM was dependent on added BSO at con- centrations lower than 2 mM. However, we presume that BSO is not the trigger per se and that it elicits the cells through a process different from that of general elicitors, because BSO treatment is not accompanied by a prompt burst of active oxygen species and causes slower accumulation of the metabolite than is seen with other elicitors. It has been proposed that the exogenous GSH may be involved in signal transduction by fungal elicitors during the initiation of phytoalexin formation as a defense response in legumes (Edwards et al., 1991). Activation of defense gene in cell suspensions of alfalfa was caused by the treatment of GSH (Choudhary et al., 1990). GSH elicited the production of a pterocarpan phytoalexin, pisatin, in pea epicotyls (Ya- mada et al., 1989) and accumulation of isoflavan phytoalexins in Lotus corniculatus root (Robbins et al., 1991). In contrast, we demonstrated that the reduction of the GSH levels by the use of BSO induced the production of 6-MM in carrot cells. In addition, GSH did not induce 6-MM production (Fig. 4). These results show that GSH is not a causal factor for the induction of 6-MM synthesis and are in agreement with the conclusion by Edwards et al. (1991), who demonstrated that the change in the level of intracellular thiols following ex- posure of suspension-cultured bean cells to a fungal elicitor was a consequence rather than a cause of the initial elicitation signal(s). GSH plays a protective role in plants by acting as a reduc- tant that removes electrophilic radicals and oxidants formed during cellular metabolism (Rennenberg, 1982; Alscher, 1989). Furthermore, it has been shown that the intracellular GSH level is elevated during environmental stresses such as heat shock (Nieto-Sotelo and Ho, 1986) and water stress (Alscher, 1989). Decreasing the intracellular GSH level by specifically blocking its biosynthetic pathway may lead to an increase in the level of active oxygen species such as super- oxide anions and H202. Actually, the rate of H202 generation in BSO-treated carrot cells was considerably higher than that in cells without BSO. Superoxide anion seems not to be involved in our case because no effect of superoxide dismutase was observed in the quenching of pyranine fluorescence. This was more di- rectly confirmed in the experiments carried out to examine the effect of exogenous GSH and H202. Exogenous GSH almost completely suppressed 6-MM production in BSO- treated cells, which is probably due to the antioxidatant activity of GSH taken up by the cells. In contrast, exogenous H202 added to the cells on the 1st d after BSO treatment enhanced the production of 6-MM over the level induced by BSO alone (Fig. 3). When H202 was administered simulta- neously with BSO, the time course of 6-MM accumulation was similar to the time course of cells treated with BSO alone. Addition of H202 without BSO induced only a small amount of 6-MM during the 1st d. In a preliminary experiment, we confirmed that exogenous H202 (1 mM) in the medium was degraded rapidly by the cells with a half-life of about 1.5 min. This means that the amount of H 2 0 2  diffusing into the cells will probably be very small. Although exogenous H202 participated in enhancing the production of 6-MM in GSH-depleted cells, it was not high enough to trigger elicitation in the cells with relatively high levels of GSH and antioxidant activity. Addition of H 2 0 2  to cells incubated with BSO for 4 d suppressed the further production of 6-MM to some extent (Fig. 3). This can be attributed to a resulting decrease in viability of the cells as judged from fluorescein diacetate staining (60% of BSO- treated cells) and from the extent of lipid peroxidation (24 +_ 4 nmol g-' fresh weight of malonaldehyde, which is nearly twice that of BSO-treated cells). These results provide indirect evidence that is consistent with the view that the presence of active oxygen species is a causal factor for 6-MM biosynthesis in BSO-treated cells. This conclusion is also supported by the observations in other species that treatment with fungal elicitors caused a burst of H 2 0 2  and/or superoxide anion at a very early stage in elici- tation in spruce cells (Schwache and Hager, 1992) and soybean cells (Lindner et al., 1988; Apostol et al., 1989), respectively. Generators of active oxygen species display an elicitor-like activity and induce phytoalexin production (Rog- ers et al., 1988). Treatment of the carrot cells with BSO did not cause the prompt burst of H 2 0 2  that was observed in the elicitation of soybean cells treated with fungal elicitor (Apostol et al., 1989), but it did cause a gradual accumulation of H202 over an extended period of time as stated earlier. This slow buildup of oxidative stress may explain the slower accumulation of 6-MM in BSO-treated carrot cells compared with the results reported by Kurosaki et al. (1985) and Marinelli et al. (1991), who observed that 6-MM accumulation in carrot cells treated with biotic elicitors reached a maximum level within 1 to 2 d. If we assume that the intracellular oxidative stress reaches a certain level high enough for elicitation only after GSH depletion (about 3 d, Fig. 2), the "real" time required for the maximal accumulation of 6-MM will be about 4 d. Further- more, the maximal value achieved in this study was much higher than the value reported by Kurosaki et al. (1985) and  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.50 G u o  et al. Plant Physiol. Vol. 102, 1993 Marinelli et al. (1991). Therefore, the fact that it takes 7 d to get to the maximal accumulation of 6-MM in BSO-treated carrot cells is not surprising. The elicitation of secondary metabolites is generally a transient response of cells because elicited metabolites are generally further metabolized and disappear from the envi- ronment (Kurosaki et al., 1984; Barz et al., 1990). One excep- tion has been reported in the accumulation of pterocarpan phytoalexins in chickpea cell-suspension cultures elicited with MnC12, which inhibits extracellular peroxidase (Barz et al., 1990). The amount of carrot phytoalexin 6-MM induced by the treatment of the cells with BSO continued to increase for 7 d and maintained the highest level for at least 3 d (Fig. 1). The continuous supply of active oxygen species as elicitor signal, due to decreased GSH levels, may account for the persistence of 6-MM in BSO-treated carrot cells. Copper salts are occasionally used to elicit phytoalexin production, and it has been demonstrated that copper ions affect plant cells through disturbance of permeability barriers in the plasma membrane, lipid peroxidation, and GSH deple- tion (Ric De Vos et al., 1992). Addition of CuC12 at 0.2 mM lowered the GSH content promptly to a level similar to that caused by 0.2 mM BSO alone and elicited the formation of a small amount of 6-MM (Fig. 5A). The simultaneous addition of both reagents to the cells brought about a synergistic stimulation of both the formation of 6-MM and the depletion of GSH (Fig. 5B). However, this synergism was suppressed by treatment with higher doses of BSO (1 mM) (Fig. 5A). Even in the presence of 1 mM of BSO, y-glutamylcysteine synthetase seems to retain a sufficient capacity for GSH synthesis to supply the minimum amount of GSH required for cell growth. However, these minimal levels of GSH may be insufficient for the formation of phytochelatins at levels high enough to remove the toxic copper ions by chelation (Ric De Vos et al., 1992). This may explain the fact that copper-induced oxidative stress in the presence of high con- centrations of BSO is too severe for the cells to maintain the maximal production of 6-MM. Experiments to examine the synergistic effects between other elicitors, such as yeast glu- can elicitor and BSO, are now in progress. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Professor A.
