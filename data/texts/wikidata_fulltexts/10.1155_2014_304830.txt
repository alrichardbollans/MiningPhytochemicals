Lignans and phenylethanoid glycosides purified from Forsythia suspensa were reported to display various bioactivities in the
previous literature, including the antimicrobial activity.Therefore, the present research is aimed to purify and identify the chemical
constituents of the methanol extracts of fruits of F. suspensa. The methanol extracts of fruits of F. suspensa were fractionated and
further purified with the assistance of column chromatography to afford totally thirty-four compounds. Among these isolates, 3𝛽-
acetoxy-20𝛼-hydroxyursan-28-oic acid (1) was reported from the natural sources for the first time. Some of the purified principles
were subjected to the antimicrobial activity examinations against Escherichia coli to explore new natural lead compounds.
1. Introduction
Food safety is an important public health issue continuously
attracting researchers from various fields. The use of biop-
reservatives and pathogen antagonists had been completed
as a means of protecting the microbiological safety of fresh
and processed products [1–4]. Lignans and phenylethanoid
glycosides are widely distributed among plant bioresources
and those purified from Forsythia suspensa have already been
reported to exhibit antimicrobial bioactivities in the previous
literature [5–13]. Although these natural compounds did
not exhibit better inhibition of the bacterial growth, they
were not very toxic while compared with the synthetic
antibiotics. F. suspensa (Oleaceae) is an important original
plant of the crude drug “rengyo” (Forsythiae Fructus) which
has been used for anti-inflammatory, diuretic, drainage, and
antimicrobial purposes in Oriental medicine [6, 8]. Previous
phytochemical investigations of Forsythia genus afforded a
series of steroids, triterpenoids, lignans, and phenylethanoid
glycosides [5–16]. In our continuous program aimed to the
bioactive principles from natural sources, the fruits of F.
suspensawere selected as the target due to their antimicrobial
potential in our preliminary bioassay (Table 1). In the present
study, we wished to report the structural characterization
of one new triterpene, 3𝛽-acetoxy-20𝛼-hydroxyursan-28-oic
acid (1), alongwith thirty-three known compounds, as well as
their antimicrobial effects against E. coli.We hoped to explore
new lead compounds which could be performed for further
investigation of the new antibiotic agents.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. General Procedure. Melting point was determined by a
Fisher Scientific melting point measuring apparatus without
corrections. The IR spectrum was obtained, as a KBr disc,
on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer. Optical rotation
was measured with an Atago AP-300 automatic polarimeter.
1H- and 13C-NMR, COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY
spectra were recorded on the Varian Unity 400 and Bruker
AV 500NMR spectrometers, using tetramethylsilane (TMS)
as the internal standard. Standard pulse sequences and
parameters were used for the NMR experiments and all
chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, 𝛿).
The low and high-resolution FABmass spectra were obtained
on a JEOL JMS-700 spectrometer operated in the positive-ion
mode. All the chemicals were purchased from Merck KGaA
(Darmstadt, Germany) unless specifically indicated. Column

followed by heating at 110∘C
for 10min.
2.2. Plant Materials. The fruits of Forsythia suspensa were
purchased from the herbal markets in Yunlin, Taiwan, and
authenticated by Dr. C. S. Kuoh (Department of Bioscience,
National ChengKungUniversity, Tainan, Taiwan). A voucher
specimen (PCKuo 2007001) was deposited in the herbarium
of the Department of Biotechnology, National Formosa
University, Yunlin, Taiwan.
2.3. Extraction and Isolation. The fruits of Forsythia sus-
pensa (6.0 Kg) were powdered and refluxed with methanol
(20 L × 7), and the combined extracts were concentrated
under reduced pressure to give a brown syrup (1.4 Kg). The
crude extract was suspended into water and partitioned with
chloroform, successively to afford chloroform (450 g) and
water soluble fractions (950 g), respectively.
The chloroform soluble extracts were purified by silica
gel column chromatography (SiO

tion. Fraction 4 was purified by SiO
2

hexane/ethyl acetate (50 : 1) to yield three subfractions (F4.1∼
4.3). The subfraction F4.2 displayed significant spots and

2
CC eluted with
chloroform/methanol gradients (100 : 1 to 1 : 1) and moni-
tored by TLC to afford five subfractions (wF4.1∼4.5). The

hydroxyphenylacetic acid methyl ester (20) (5mg). Subfrac-
tion wF4.2 was applied to SiO

minor fractions wF4.4.2, wF4.4.4, and wF4.4.5 displayed
significant spots and were applied to SiO
2
CC, eluted with
chloroform/methanol (10 : 1) to afford 2-furancarboxylic acid
(23) (15mg), salidroside (24) (18mg), and (6S,9R)-roseoside
(25) (10mg), respectively. Subfraction wF4.5 was repeatedly
subjected to SiO

tallization of the minor fractions with chloroform/methanol
to yield esculetin (30) (3mg) and caffeic acid (31) (12mg),
respectively. Fraction 6 (wF6) was isolated by SiO
2
CC
eluted with chloroform/methanol gradients (100 : 1 to 1 : 1)
and monitored by TLC to result in five subfractions (wF6.1∼
6.5). Only subfractions wF6.2 andwF6.3 displayed significant
spots and therefore were subjected to the further purification.

2.4. Antimicrobial Activity
2.4.1. Microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity was evalu-
ated against Escherichia coli (BCRC-11634). The strains were
kept at −70∘C in Luria-Bertani agar (LBA), activated by
transferring into nutritive agar and incubating at 37 ± 1.0∘C
for 18 h.The bacterial suspension of each strain was prepared
in a sterile tube with glass pearls and turbidity adjusted with
distillatedwater, according toMcFarland scale number 1 tube,
which corresponds to approximately 3 × 108 CFU/mL [13].
2.4.2. Determination of the In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity.
Theantimicrobial activities against E. coli of different concen-
trations of tested samples were determined by the microtiter
plate method described by the United States Pharmacopeia
[17]. A twofold microdilution broth method was used to
determinate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
value for each test substance [18–21]. Each well contained
106 CFU/mL of test bacteria and LBmedium (100 𝜇L). 100 𝜇L
of MeOH solutions of tested samples (5mg/mL for pure
compounds and 20mg/mL for the fractions) was added to
wells of the first row. Dilutions were used to dispense 100 𝜇L
into the other sterile 96 wells of an ELISA plate using a mul-
tichannel micropipette, resulting in eight concentrations to
be tested for each compound. A negative control containing
inoculated growthmediumandmethanolwas prepared. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate.
2.4.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Determina-
tion. The MIC value is a measure to define the antibacterial
activity of a compound and is defined as the lowest concen-
tration of drug that inhibits visible growth. The amount of
growth in the wells containing test samples was compared
with the amount of growth in the control wells when
determining the growth end points. When a single skipped
well occurred, the highest MIC was read.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Isolation and Characterization of Compounds. Dried
and powdered fruits of F. suspensa were extracted with
methanol, and the combined extracts were concentrated
under reduced pressure to give deep brown syrup. The
crude extract was suspended into water and partitioned
with chloroform to afford chloroform and water solu-
ble fractions, respectively. Purification of the chloroform
fraction of the methanol extracts of fruits of F. suspensa
by a combination of chromatographic techniques yielded
one new triterpene, 3𝛽-acetoxy-20𝛼-hydroxyursan-28-oic
acid (1) (Figure 1), 𝛽-amyrin acetate (2) [22], taraxasterol
acetate (3) [23], 3𝛽-acetyl-20,25-epoxy-dammarane-24𝛼-ol
(4) [24], acetyl oleanolic acid (5) [25], betulinic acid (6)
[26], labda-8(17),13E-dien-15,18-dioic acid 15-methyl ester

the reversed-phase Diaion HP-20 column chromatography
and successive isolation to afford p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid
(17), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (18), p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid
methyl ester (20) [36], p-tyrosol (21) [37], hydroxytyrosol

The chemical structures of known compounds 2–34 were
identified by comparison of their physical and spectroscopic
data with those reported in the literature. Among the isolates,
compounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 16, 17, 24, 26, 28, 31, and 34 had
been identified from the titled plant. Other compounds were
reported from F. suspensa for the first time. Compound 1 was
a new compound and its structure was established by the
spectral analysis.
3.2. Structural Elucidation of Compound 1. Thepurifiedwhite
powder 1 was visualized by spraying with 1% (w/v) Ce(SO

followed by heating at 120∘C
and displayed purplish black spots on TLC plate. It also
displayed positive responses against the Lieberman-Burchard

by the pseudomolecular [M+H]+ ion peak atm/z 517.3896 in

21.3), one carboxylic acid group (𝛿C 176.8), one oxygenated
quaternary carbon (𝛿C 90.1), and one acetoxygenated carbon
(𝛿C 80.9), respectively. In the
1H-NMR spectrum of 1, there
were proton signals for sevenmethyl groups at 𝛿 0.83 (15H,m,
and CH
3
-23, -24, -25, -27, and -29), 0.94 (3H, s, and CH
3
-26),
and 1.35 (3H, s, and CH
3
-30), and one acetyl methyl group at
𝛿 2.05 (3H, s, and CH
3
-32), respectively. The spectroscopic
data indicated compound 1 to possess oleanane type basic
skeleton. In the downfield region, one oxygenated proton at 𝛿
4.48 (1H, dd, J = 10.4, 5.6Hz, H-3𝛼) was located at C-3 which
was further established by the NOESY correlations between
CH
3
-23 and H-3. The 2J, 3J-HMBC correlations from 𝛿 4.48
(H-3) to 𝛿C 21.3 (C-32) and 171.0 (C-31) also evidenced the
presence of acetoxy group at C-3. The substitution of tertiary
alcohol at C-20 was also determined with the HMBC analysis
of correlations from CH
3
-30 to C-21 (𝛿C 31.2) and C-20 (𝛿C
90.1). The 2J, 3J-HMBC correlation peak between 𝛿 2.60 (m,
H-16) and 𝛿C 176.8 (C-28) supported the carboxylic acid
group to be attached at C-17.The complete assignments of 1H
and 13C NMR signals of 1 were furnished from the NOESY
andHMBC spectra.Therefore the chemical structure of 1was
established as 3𝛽-acetoxy-20𝛼-hydroxyursan-28-oic acid and
shown in Figure 1.
3.3. The Antimicrobial Effects of Isolated Compounds against
Escherichia coli. The crude extracts, partially purified frac-
tions, and some of the purified principles (Figure 2) were
subjected to the examinations for the inhibitory effects
against E. coli [17–21]. The MIC data of the fractions were
presented in Table 1. The MIC value of crude extracts (FS)
was 4.25mg/mL and demonstrated inhibition of the bacte-
rial growth. Comparatively, the chloroform fraction (FSC)
displayed more significant inhibitory effects against E. coli
(BCRC-11634) than the water fraction (FSW) with MIC
values of 6.25 and 12.50mg/mL, respectively. When studying
the influence of the concentration of compounds on the
antimicrobial activities against E. coli, twofold microdilution
broth method was used for the purified principles from the
chloroform fraction (FSC), including triterpenoids 1,2,6, and
10; diterpenoids 11 and 12; and lignan 16. It was observed that
as the concentration increased, the inhibition of the bacterial
growth was also increased. All of the tested samples demon-
strated the inhibitory effects in a concentration-dependent
manner. The MIC data of the examined compounds were
presented in Table 2. The MIC values were in the range

Figure 2: Structures of the isolated compounds subjected to the antimicrobial assay.
between 1.20 and 5.00mg/mL against E. coli (BCRC-11634).
Among the tested compounds, triterpenoids betulinic acid
(6) and 𝜓-taraxasterol (10) exhibited the most significant
inhibition against E. coli with MIC values of 1.20mg/mL.
These principles should be responsible for the bioactivity of
the chloroform fraction (FSC). The results exhibited that the
triterpenoids from the methanol extracts of fruits of F. sus-
pensa possessed antibacterial activities against the common
bacteria. It also provided evidence for the traditional uses of
the fruits of F. suspensa as herbal medicines in the treatment
of bacterial diseases. Although these purified compounds did
not display better inhibition of the bacterial growth compared
with the reported synthetic antibiotics, the extracts and
principles from the natural sources usually possessed lower
toxicity. Further structural modification could be performed
to improve the activity and maintain the safety of these
compounds. Therefore, it would be potentially useful in
developing new antimicrobial therapeutic agents.
