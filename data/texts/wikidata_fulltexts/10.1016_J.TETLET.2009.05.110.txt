Acutaxylines A and B, two novel triterpenes from Dysoxylum acutangulum  ABSTRACT Two novel triterpenes, acutaxylines A (1) and B (2) consisting of a cyclopentenone side chain at C-17 and an oxepan-2-ol, were isolated from the leaves of Dysoxylum acutangulum. The relative stereochemistry of 1 and 2 was determined by NOESY correlations. Acutaxyline B showed moderate cytotoxicity against human blood premyelocytic leukemia cells.
