Antifungal Synergistic Effect of Scopoletin, a HydroxycoumarinIsolated from Melia azedarach L. FruitsMARIÄA C. CARPINELLA, CARLOS G. FERRAYOLI, AND SARA M. PALACIOS*CEPROCOR, Agencia Co´rdoba Ciencia S.E., Alvarez de Arenales 230,Barrio Juniors, X5004AAP Co´rdoba, ArgentinaIn the continuous search for antifungal compounds from plants, the hydroxycoumarin scopoletin (1)was isolated from seed kernels of Melia azedarach L. from which three other compounds, vanillin(2), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (3), and (() pinoresinol (4), have also been isolated. Guidedfractionation through autobiography on TLC using Fusarium verticillioides (Saccardo) Nirenberg astest organism led to the isolation of 1, which exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of1.50 mg/mL in the microbroth dilution method. Despite its own weak activity, when the coumarin wascombined with the above-mentioned compounds, a strong enhancement of the antifungal effect wasobserved, even showing a complete inhibition in the growth of the pathogen when 1 was added ata concentration of up to 5% of its MIC value. The same level of effectiveness was observed whenthe synthetic antifungal agents Mancozeb and Carboxin were each combined with compounds 1-4,in which cases it became possible to decrease the effective concentrations of these commercialcompounds by up to 2.5 and 3%, respectively.KEYWORDS: Antifungal activity; Melia azedarach ; Fusarium verticillioides ; scopoletin; synergism;Mancozeb; CarboxinINTRODUCTIONMembers of theFusariumgenus are widely distributed soilfungi and among those most commonly isolated by plantpathologists (1). CertainFusariumfungi, particularlyFusariumVerticillioides, are capable of causing a variety of diseases incorn, including seedling disease and stalk and ear rots (2, 3).TheFusariumstalk and ear rot complex constitutes a widespreaddisease problem in maize (Zea mays) that can be found in nearlyevery maize field at harvest (2). Yield losses occur as a resultof premature plant death and lodging, with a reduction in thequantity or quality of the crop.F. Verticillioides can infectkernels without causing visible symptoms (3, 4) but stillaffecting grain quality by producing mycotoxins, particularlyfumonisins (4, 5). Fumonisins cause, in humans and animals,liver and kidney toxicity and carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity,pulmonary edema, immunosuppression or -stimulation, anddisruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis through inhibition ofceramide synthase (6-8). The presence of the fungus or itstoxins is particularly disadvantageous in developing countries,where maize and maize-based products are the staple food forlarge populations.NowadaysF. Verticillioides infection is controlled by manysynthetic products (9), which are also, however, highly toxicto human and animal life (9, 10) and responsible, among otherinconveniences, for the generation of toxic residues and theirnegative impact on the environment (11) and for the develop-ment of resistance in pathogens (12, 13). There is thus an urgentneed to be able to control this and other pathogenic fungi andtheir mycotoxin production by negligibly toxic and environ-mentally friendly methods.In the search for new sources of products suitable for safeand sustainable agriculture management, bioactive substancesobtained from plants are a promising way of controlling thiskind of fungus. Plants have an almost limitless ability tosynthesize secondary metabolites, most of which are phenolsor their oxygen-substituted derivatives (14). In many cases thesesubstances provide the plant with a resistance mechanism againstdisease or insect attack (15, 16).Our research group has long been studying the chemistry ofa highly active Meliaceae,Melia azedarachL. (17-19), lookingfor active principles that can be used as safe biopesticides. Thistree, commonly named paraiso, grows easily in temperate andcold-temperate zones of Argentina, where it is widespread.Extracts from different plant structures ofM. azedarachhavealready been studied and show important antifungal activity,especially the seed kernel extract (SKE) (20, 21), from whichantifungal compounds such as vanillin (2), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (3), and ( ) pinoresinol (4) have beenisolated (21). We have now investigated the antifungal effectexhibited by scopoletin alone and in combination with the threepreviously isolated antifungal compounds (21). The synergisticeffect developed after the combination of Mancozeb or Carboxinwith compounds1-4 was also studied.* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed [telephone(03541) 489650/53; fax 03541-488181; e-mail sarapalacios@uolsinectis.com.ar].2922 J.

Ripe fruits fromM. azedarachL. were collectedin Córdoba, Argentina, in October 2001. A voucher specimen wasdeposited in the Botanical Museum of Co´rd ba (CORD 229, Co´rdoba,Argentina).Chemicals.Mancozeb [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamic acid) manganesezinc complex] and Carboxin [5,6 dihydro-2-methyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide], both of technical grade, were purchased from Riedel-de Haën Co. (Seelze, Germany).General Experimental Procedures and Apparatus.1H and 13CNMR spectra were recorded in CD3CN (Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.)with a Bruker AC 200 spectrometer operated at 200 MHz for1H andat 50 MHz for the13C nucleus. Chemical shifts (parts per million) arerelative to internal tetramethylsilane used as a reference. Gas chroma-tography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was performed on a 17 A-QP5000 instrument (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a NIST 107,1998, mass spectral library. High-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) was performed on a Waters 2690 instrument, equipped with a250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5µm, Phenomenex Luna ODS reversed-phasecolumn and photodiode array detector. The mobile phase was 1% aceticacid/MeOH in a gradient of 75:25 to 50:50, and detection was at 345nm. Analytical and preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) wasperformed on silica gel 60 F254 Merck plates (Darmstadt, Germany).Silica gel was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Inc. (St. Louis,MO). All solvents were purchased from Merck and Fischer Scientific(Fair Lawn, NJ).Isolation and Identification of Antifungal Principles. Air-driedkernels of ripe fruits ofM. azedarach(2453 g) were extracted withethanol after defatting with hexane to obtain an extract (SKE), yielding3.17 g/100 g of seed kernels. For the isolation of the antifungalprinciples, a CH2Cl2 fraction (33.12 g), obtained by partitioning threetimes the SKE dissolved in 300 mL of MeOH/CH2Cl2/H2O (12:3:15),was chromatographed using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC)packed with silica gel 230-400 mesh and petroleum ether and elutedwith a petroleum ether/Et2O/Me2CO/MeOH mixture, with increasingpolarity. Ten fractions (F-1F-10) were collected. To determine theantifungal activity of each fraction, direct bioautography was made onTLC (21). From F-3, an active compound obtained by sublimation wasisolated and identified as vanillin (2), yield ) 0.029 g/100 g of seedkernel, by HPLC (21).From F-4 to F-9 a compound that showed an inhibition zone ondirect bioautography TLC on a bright fluorescent spot (360 nm)corresponding to anRf 0.75 (CHCl3/MeCN 2:1) was isolated aftersuccessive VLC, radial preparative chromatography (eluted with CHCl3/MeCN or petroleum ether/ethyl acetate mixture with increasingpolarity), and finally preparative TLC developed in ethyl acetate. Thefluorescent band was scraped off and eluted with CH3 N. Thiscompound was identified as scopoletin (1) Figure 1), according to1Hand13C NMR spectra and comparison with a GC-MS library, and theyield was 0.0018 g/100 g of seed kernel, by HPLC.From the same fractions, two more active compounds were alsoisolated, after successive vacuum liquid and radial preparative chro-matography carried out as above explained. The first compound wasidentified by spectroscopic means as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamal-dehyde (3), yield ) 0.054 g/100 g of seed kernel, by HPLC (21), andthe second one was obtained as a white crystalline solid, yield) 0.131g/100 g of seed kernel, by HPLC and was identified as (()-pinoresinol(4) (21).Scopoletin (1): C10O4H8; tR ) 18.1 min (by HPLC); MS,m/z (relint %) 192 (M+, 100), 164 (31), 149 (54), 121 (29), 79 (18), 69 (69),65 (15), 51 (41);1H NMR (200 MHz, CD3CN) δ 3.92 (3 H, s, OMe),6.20 (1H, d,J ) 9.5 Hz, H-3), 6.84 (1 H, s, H-8), 7.11 (1 H, s, H-5),7.77 (1H, d,J ) 9.5 Hz, H-4);13C NMR (50.0 MHz, CD3CN) δ 57.4(ArOMe), 104.0 (C-8), 110.3 (C-5), 113.9 (C-3), 145.2 (C-4), 146.1(C-6), 151.4 (C-8), 151.7 (C-7).Microorganism and Growth Medium. F. Verticillioides (Saccardo)Nirenberg strain M-7075 (a voucher specimen was deposited in theNational University of Rı´o Cuarto), isolated from maize by Dra. S.Chulze and provided by Dra. L. Giorda, was maintained as amonosporic culture in a V8 juice medium (22).Antifungal Assay. A broth microdilution method (13) carried outin a 96-well sterilized microplate was used to determine the minimuminhibitory concentration (MIC) of compound1, of the other purecompounds, and of different combinations among them or combinedwith the synthetic fungicides Mancozeb or Carboxin. MICs weredetermined as the lowest concentration that produces complete growthinhibition of the tested fungus.Four-day-old spores fromF. Verticillioides were added to sterileglucose-mineral salts medium to reach 105 spores/mL. Scopoletin (1)dissolved in filter (PVDF 0.45µm; Millipore, Billerica, MA) sterilizeddimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was incorporated in duplicate into eachwell containing the spore suspension, resulting in concentrations rangingfrom 0.10 to 1.70 mg/mL. The final concentration of DMSO did notexceed 2-4%. Wells containing spore suspension with the addition orotherwise of DMSO were simultaneously run as controls. The percent-age of fungi growth, recorded as spore germination with respect tocontrol (of which mycelial growth was considered as 100% of growth)was visually assessed with an inverted light microscope for eachconcentration of the compound. The measurements were always doneby the same operator. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) value wascalculated by Probit analysis on the basis of the percentage of inhibitionobtained at each concentration of the sample.Synergism among the pure compounds was also measured as aboveby adding to each well containing the inoculum different combinationsof two, three, or four of the compounds to be tested, at differentconcentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.75 mg/mL (DMSO finalconcentration< 6%).The synergistic effect of1-4 with Mancozeb or Carboxin was alsomeasured by adding concentrations of natural compounds ranging from0.05 to 0.70 mg/mL and of Mancozeb and Carboxin corresponding to0.05× 10-3-0.01× 10-1 and 0.25× 10-1-0.50 mg/mL, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe antifungal activity of seed kernel extract fromM.azedarachhas been reported in previous publications, and threecompounds responsible for this activity have been isolated (21).In this study, another antifungal compound, the hydroxycou-marin scopoletin (1), was obtained from the same extract,showing a weak antifungal effect per se but, when combinedwith the other active compounds, a greatly unexpected enhance-ment of the activity.MICs of Individual Compounds. The MIC of scopoletin(1) againstF. Verticillioides was 1.50 mg/mL, with its IC50equivalent to 0.73 mg/mL (95% confidence interval) 0.60-0.88). The latter is similar to that of pinoresinol (4) (IC50 )0.76 mg/mL; 95% confidence interval) 0.37-1.56) (21). Thislevel of activity could be in part compared to that described byShukla et al. (23), who, although obtaining an IC50 of compound1 on Fusarium fusiformis(0.82 mg/mL) similar to that weFigure 1. Chemical structures of scopoletin (1), vanillin (2), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (3), and pinoresinol (4).Antifungal Synergistic Effect of Compounds from M. azedarach J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 8, 2005 2923obtained onF. Verticillioides, found the inhibition produced withthe highest assayed concentration, equivalent to 1.00 mg/mL,was 51.8% (23), whereas onF. Verticillioides this concentrationproduced 90% control, as seen inFigure 2. On Alternariaalternata, scopoletin exhibited a complete inhibition at 1.00 mg/mL (23). OnFusarium semitectum, 66.2% of growth inhibitionwas reached at the same concentration, but the IC50 correspond-ing to 0.47 mg/mL differs from that obtained withF. fusiformis(23). The MICs of compounds2, 3, and4 corresponded to 0.60,0.40, and 1.00 mg/mL, respectively (21).Synergistic Effect among Compounds 1-4. As was re-ported by Carpinella et al. (21), the antifungal compounds2-4isolated from the SKE ofM. azedarachexhibited a strongsynergistic effect among themselves. This time we questionedif scopoletin (1) showed the same effect and at what level ofpotency it worked. To answer this question, a broth microdi-lution method was carried out by adding the compounds1-4in different combinations of two, three, or four, which, in mostcases, were equivalent to half or less of their MIC values.The synergistic effect between compounds1 and 2-4 isshown in Table 1. When compound1 was added at aconcentration corresponding to 33% of its MIC value (0.50 mg/mL) and2 at 50% of its MIC (0.30 mg/mL), a 100% inhibitionin the growth ofF. Verticillioideswas exhibited, and even whenthe concentration of compound1 was decreased to 0.08 mg/mL, a value equivalent to 5% of its MIC value, an effect of88% control was still observed. Inhibitions of 92 and 98% weredetected when1, added at 33% of its MIC, was combined withcompound2 reduced to 33% (0.20 mg/mL) and 25% (0.15 mg/mL), respectively, of its MIC value. This level of inhibitionwas still observed when the concentration of compound1 wasdecreased to 20% of its MIC (0.30 mg/mL) with compound2remaining at 33%. At the latter level, compound2 aloneexhibited an effectiveness in the inhibition corresponding to20%, whereas at 25% of its MIC the inhibition was 0% (Figure2). On its own, compound1 at 33% of its MIC value or lowerdeveloped no inhibition (Figure 2), clearly showing thesynergistic effect between the compounds.When1 was combined at 5% of its MIC with compound3at 50% of the total inhibitory concentration (0.20 mg/mL),growth inhibition was complete. When compound1 was addedat 10% of its MIC (0.15 mg/mL) and the concentration of3was decreased to 25% of its MIC (0.10 mg/mL), a 90%inhibition developed. The results indicate that the potentiationof the effect between1 and 3 is stronger than that observedbetween1 and2 (Table 1). It is important to bear in mind thatcompound3 individually, at 50 and 25% of its MIC, showedonly 20 and 0%, respectively, of control of the pathogen (Figure2).When compound1 was added at 5% of its MIC and4 at0.70 mg/mL, equivalent to 70% of its MIC value, 90% inhibitionwas detected. Only 20% inhibition was detected by combining20% of the MIC of1 and 40% of the MIC of4 (0.40 mg/mL),increasing to 100% when the concentration of1 was increasedto a 33%. As can be seen inFigure 2, compound4 alone at0.40 mg/mL showed no inhibition ofF. Verticillioides.To compare the level of efficacy of the combinations of1with compounds2-4, we observed that adding the former, at10% of its MIC, to each of the other compounds, at 50% of theminimum concentration that produces total growth inhibition,showed that the most potent combination was between1 + 3with 100% inhibition, followed by the 94% growth inhibitionexhibited by1 + 2, and finally 1 + 4, which showed 45%control (Table 1).When any of the compounds2-4, combined among them-selves at 20 or 25% of their MICs (21), were replaced bycompound1 at 20% of its MIC, an increase in the inhibition ofthe pathogen was observed. For instance, when compound2was combined with compound3, both at 25% of their MICs, a90% inhibition was produced (21). When3 was replaced by1,at 20% of its MIC, the level of inhibition did not change (88%)but when2 was the metabolite replaced, an increase to 100%control was detected (Table 1). This complete inhibitionbetween3 and1 contrasted with a 2% control exhibited by thecombination of 25% of the MIC of3 and, in this case, a 20%of 4 (0.20 mg/mL) (21) in place of 1. If compound3 wasreplaced by 20% of the MIC of1, keeping4 at 20%, a lowincrease from 2 to 20-25% would be obtained (Table 1).Combining2 at 25% of its MIC with4 at 20%, 80% inhibitionwas exhibited (21), increasing to 88% when4 was replaced by1 at the same quantity. These results showed that the ap-proximate level of potency was, in decreasing order,1 + 3,followed by the combination of1 + 2, then2 + 3 or 2 + 4,then1 + 4, and finally3 + 4.As was previously explained (21), whereas2 + 3, addedtogether at 33 and 25%, respectively, of their MIC, exerted 95%inhibition onF. Verticillioides, this inhibition increased to 100%when1 was added to the pair at as little as 5% of its MIC value(Table 2). Combining2 at 25% and4 at 20% of their MICs,Figure 2.

However, when compound1 wasadded at 27% of its MIC (0.40 mg/mL), the control was total(Table 2).When 5% of the MIC of1 was added to the combination of3 at 25% of its MIC and4 at 20%, inhibition increased greatlyfrom 2 (21) to 85%. Adding compound1, at 5% of its MIC, to3 and4 at 12.5% (0.05 mg/mL) and 70% (0.70 mg/mL) of theirrespective MICs produced 90% inhibition (Table 2). Thecombination of3 and 4 alone inhibited growth by 80% (21).As seen inTable 1, the combination of 5% of1 and4 at 70%of its MIC produced 90% inhibition. This means that3 did notenhance activity in the combination of1 and4. When2, 3, and4 were added at 12.5, 25, and 10%, respectively, of their MICs(0.08, 0.10, and 0.10 mg/mL, respectively), an 82% inhibitionwas observed (21), increasing to 95% when1 was added at 5%of its MIC (Table 2). These results demonstrate the potentiationeffect exhibited when compound1 was present, even at verylow concentrations with respect to its MIC.As noted, even when scopoletin did not possess high levelsof control per se, it showed, combined with the other antifungalcompounds, an enhancement in the growth inhibitory effect,through a synergistic potentiation. Stark and Walter (24) reservethe term “synergism” only for when the greater activity is aresult of the sum of the individual effects of two ingredientswith similar modes of action, and they use “potentiation” whenthe two ingredients show different modes of action. We preferto talk about “synergism of sum”, as the result of the sum ofthe effects of each compound on the same or different targets,or “synergistic potentiation”, as the enhancement of the effectresulting from the combined action of two or more compoundswith different or the same modes of action, but when the finalactivity produced is greater than the individual sum of effects.In most of our assays, the combinations showed a synergisticpotentiation, even though the metabolites act with the same ordifferent modes of action, which must be studied in more detail.This effect, mainly displayed when the weak antifungalcompound1 was present, may be due in part to a direct effecton fungi survival or germination, by the inhibition of broad-specificity multidrug resistant pumps (MDRs), an efflux mech-anism found in microorganisms which provides a barrier toantifungal metabolites (25, 26), by inhibition of detoxificationenzymes (14, 27), or by decreasing excretion (28). For instance,given the antioxidant properties exhibited by compound1 (29,30), it is possible that subinhibitory concentrations of it wouldinhibit the oxidation of vanillin, added at sub-MIC levels, tothe inactive vanillic acid (31, 32). The aldehyde function in thevanillin structure is necessary for its effectiveness against fungi(33). If any of the compounds1-4 is a MDR inhibitor, allowingthe remaining compounds to accumulate in the cell, this wouldmake their weak to moderate activity increase and enable themto really show their previously masked strong antifungalproperties, which could be as effective as those exhibited byconventional antifungals (26). This potentiation activity mightexplain why the quantity of compound1 needed for in vitroinhibition of the growth ofOphiostoma ulmiis greater than thequantity found in the culture medium of inoculated cellsuspensions of resistantUlmus pumila(15), where1 may exhibitsynergism together with other five chemicals present in theresistantUlmusspecies.Synergistic Effect between Compounds 1-4 and SyntheticAntifungal Compounds. Compound1 also exhibited a strongsynergistic effect with the synthetic compounds Mancozeb andCarboxin. The antifungal agent Mancozeb exhibited a MIC valueagainstF. Verticillioidesof 0.01 mg/mL. The MIC of Carboxinwas difficult to determine due to its low solubility in water,but corresponded to∼1.70 mg/mL. As seen inTable 3, whencompound1 was added at 20% of its corresponding MIC andMancozeb at a concentration corresponding to 2.5% of its MIC(0.25 × 10-3 mg/mL), a complete inhibition of the referencefungus was observed. An inhibition of 90% was obtained whenthe concentration of Mancozeb decreased to 0.01× 0-2 mg/mL, equivalent to only 1% of its MIC, and compound1 wasadded at 27% of its MIC. In both cases the correspondingconcentrations of Mancozeb exhibited, individually, 20% controlof the pathogen.When Carboxin and scopoletin (1) were added together, bothat 0.50 mg/mL, corresponding to 29 and 33%, respectively, oftheir corresponding MICs, a total inhibition of the pathogen(Table 4) was observed; individually both compounds at thisconcentration showed zero effect on fungi. Even when theconcentrations of1 and Carboxin were decreased to 27 and 6%(0.10 mg/mL), respectively, of their corresponding MICs, 70%inhibition was still detected. Decreasing the concentrations ofCarboxin to values equivalent to 3-1.5% of its MIC theinhibition reached values from 65 to 20% (Table 4). Theseinhibitory levels show that the synergistic effect between1 andMancozeb was more effective than that displayed between1and Carboxin. As observed, these results imply that the usefulquantities of the commercial agents could be greatly reduced,at the same time decreasing their toxicity in mammals andnegative environmental impact, as well as the cost of controllingdiseases in corn crops.Scopoletin can be found in many edible plants and fruits suchas AVena satiVa, Allium ampeloprasum, Apium graVeolens,Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Daucus carota, Cicho-rium intybus, Citrus limon, andC. paradisi, which denotes itslow toxicity, guaranteeing its safe use as an antifungal orsynergistic compound in combination with synthetic or othernatural substances, such as vanillin. Given the strong specificTable 2.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 8, 2005 2925flavor that the latter negligibly toxic compound exhibits, it isnot suitable for use in preventing fungus growth in manufacturedfood at the concentrations at which it displays inhibitory activity(33, 34). Diminishing its effective doses would thus be of greatadvantage.After these successful findings involving synthetic antifungalagents and compound1, we studied the same action with therest of the compounds. Compounds2-4 were combined withMancozeb, and the same synergistic potentiation exhibited withcompound1 was produced. As is seen inTable 3, whencompound2 at 50% of its MIC value was added to Mancozebat 5% of its MIC (0.05× 10-2 mg/mL), a complete inhibitionin pathogen growth was detected, decreasing only 3% whenthe Mancozeb concentration was reduced to 1% of its MIC.An almost total inhibition was observed when compound3 andMancozeb were combined at 25 and 5%, respectively, of theirMICs (Table 3). When the same quantity of the syntheticcompound was added to4 at 50% of its MIC, a 100% inhibitionwas exhibited.When2-4 were combined with Carboxin, the effect, as inthe case of1, was not as strong as with Mancozeb. High butnot total inhibition values (Table 4) were observed after theaddition of2 at 83 and 67% of its MIC (0.50 and 0.40 mg/mL,respectively) to Carboxin at 29 to 1.5% of its MIC (0.50 to0.25 × 10-1 mg/mL, respectively). The combination of3 at25% of its MIC value and Carboxin at 29% showed 85% growthinhibition. The most potent combination with Carboxin, evenhigher than that observed in combination with1, was producedby compound4. With 4 at 70% of its MIC together withCarboxin even at 3% of its corresponding MIC (0.05 mg/mL),complete inhibition was detected (Table 4).These last results imply that compounds2-4 could also beused to reduce the effective concentrations of toxic syntheticantifungals such as Mancozeb and Carboxin, which are widelyused in conventional agriculture, which, in most agriculturalcountries, involves the majority of their field crops. Thisextensive use increases the risk of undesirable effects on theenvironment and on human and animal health, which could bereduced by replacing, at least in part, the synthetic substancesby natural negligibly toxic, highly specific, and biodegradableantifungal or synergistic compounds.ABBREVIATIONSSKE, seed kernel extract; GC-MS, gas chromatography-massspectrometry; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography;TLC, thin-layer chromatography; VLC, vacuum liquid chro-matography; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; DMSO,dimethyl sulfoxide; MDR, multidrug resistant pump.ACKNOWLEDGMENTWe are grateful to Dra.
