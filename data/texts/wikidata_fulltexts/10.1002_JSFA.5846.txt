Volatile constituents of roasted tigernut oil (Cyperus esculentus L.). 
 
ABSTRACT 
BACKGROUND: Volatile compounds play a key role in determining the sensory 
appreciation of vegetable oils. In this study a systematic evaluation of odorants responsible 
for the characteristic flavour of roasted tigernut oil was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 75 
odour-active volatiles were identified. From these, 13 aroma compounds showing high 
flavour dilution factors in the range of 16 to 128 were quantified by their odour activity 
values (OAVs). On the basis of high OAVs in oil, the following aroma compounds [vanillin 
(chocolate, sweet vanilla), 5-ethylfurfural (caramel, spicy), 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-
methyl-4H-pyran-4-one (caramel), phenyl acetaldehyde (honey-like), ethanone, 1-(4-
hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) (faint vanilla)] were elucidated as important contributors to the 
overall chocolate, sweet vanilla, butterscotch aroma of the oil. CONCLUSION: Odorants 
with high concentrations in the roasted tigernut oil such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, ethyl 
hexadecanoate, n-propyl-9,12-octadecadienoate gave relatively low OAVs, so their 
contributions to the overall orthonasal aroma impression of roasted tigernut oil can be 
assumed to be low. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.
