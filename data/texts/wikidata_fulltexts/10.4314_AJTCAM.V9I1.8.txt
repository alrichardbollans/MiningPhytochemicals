Abstract 
 
Three flavonoids were isolated for the first time from the Sudanese medicinal plants Albizia zygia. Compounds 1-3 
were identified by interpretation of ESI mass data, 1H, 13C and 2D NMR as well as by comparison with published data as 
4',7-dihydroxyflavanone (1) 3',4',7-trihydroxyflavone (2), 3-O-methylfisetin (3',4',7-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone, 3). All 
flavonoids were tested against Plasmodium falciparum, and only compound 2 showed high antimalarial activity (IC50 0.078 
μg/ml). 
 
Keywords: Albizia zygia; Mimosoideae; flavonoids; antimalarial activity 
 
 
Introduction  
 
Albizia zygia (DC.) J.F. Macbr. (Leguminosae subfamily Mimosoideae) is a gum producing tree widely found in 
West Africa (Hutchinson et al., 1972). In previous phytochemical studies of A. zygia, lupen-20(30)-en-3-ol and its glyco-
side, stigmast-5-en-3-ol, and 5-stigmasta-7,22-dien-3-ol were isolated (Schoppa and Pachaly, 1981) as well as al-
biziaprenol and phytol were reported (Pachaly et al., 1983). Also, the gum of the plant has been widely investigated for its 
chemical and physical properties (e.g. as thickening agent) in comparison with other mucilages (Ashton et al., 1975; Mital et 
al., 1979). In traditional medicine, the powdered bark of A. zygia is used alone or as a decoction in southern Sudan as an 
antimalarial and antiparasitic drug. The methanolic extract of the stem bark exhibited antiprotozoal activity (IC50 1.0 μg/ml) 
against Plasmodium falciparum strain K1, the protozoa responsible for malaria, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (IC50 
0.2 μg/ml), which causes African trypanosomiasis (Ndjakou et al., 2007). It is interesting to note that lupeol, which was 
isolated previously from this plant has been found to inhibit the growth of P. falciparum by 45% at 25 μg/ml (De Almeida 
Alves et al., 1997), which could account at least in part for the antiprotozoal activity observed for the methanol extract of A. 
zygia (Ndjakou et al., 2007).  
 
 
Material and Methods 
 
The bark of A. zygia was collected from Shambat, Sudan, in June 2006. The plant material was authenticated by 
Mr. Wail El Saddig (National Research Centre, Sudan) based on comparison with voucher specimen deposited in the herbar-
ium of the Institute of the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Khartoum, Sudan.  
 An air-dried sample (1.0 kg) of the bark of A. zygia was powdered and extracted (3) with 50% CH2Cl2/MeOH. 
The extracts were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure to give a dark brown residue (148.6 g). This extract was 
partitioned between ethyl acetate and water, which delivered 7.3 g of crude product after evaporation of the organic phase, 
and 139.5 g from the water phase. Fractionation of the organic extract was carried out using silica gel flash chromatography 
(230-400 mesh) with a cyclohexane/EtOAc gradient. According to the TLC profiles three major fractions were obtained. 
Fraction FI was further purified on Sephadex LH-20 (Lipophilic Sephadex, Amersham Biosciences Ltd.; purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) using CH2Cl2/MeOH (6:4) followed by gradient chromatography on LiChro-
prep RP-18 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) eluted with MeOH/H2O (10:90 to 50:50), which afforded compound 1 (1.0 
mg). Fraction FII was also separated on LiChroprep RP-18 eluted with MeOH/H2O (10:90 to 50:50) to give compounds 2 
(2.7 mg) and 3 (1.7 mg).   
The gum from the water phase was triturated with MeOH and the soluble part, after evaporation to dryness, was 
subjected to gradient chromatography on silica gel eluted with EtOAc/MeOH. This afforded compound 4 (2.9 mg).

Results and Discussion 
 
Compounds 1-4 were unambiguously identified by interpretation of ESI mass data, 1H, 13C and 2D NMR spectra as 
well as by comparison with published data as 4',7-dihydroxyflavanone (1) (Umehara et al., 2009), 3',4',7-trihydroxyflavone 
(2) (Wu et al., 2008), 3-O-methylfisetin (3',4',7-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone, 3) (Wu et al., 2008), and lup-20(29)-en-3-ol 
(4) (Blair et al., 1970).

The genus Albizia consists of over 150 species. The occurrence of albiziasaponins A, B, C (Pal, et al., 1995),  macrocyclic 
alkaloids budmunchiamines L4, L5, and L6 (Ajay and Laxmi, 1997), and albizinin (Ma, 1997) have been reported from 
Albizia lebbeck. Kaempferol and quercetin were isolated from A. julibrissin (Lau et al., 2007) and A. lebbeck (El-
Mousallamy, 1998). Prenylated flavonoids such as sophoflavescenol and kurarinone were also known from A. lebbeck (Jung 
et al., 2004). The unusual biflavonoids, eucaediflavone and albiproflavone were delivered from A. procera (Yadav and Bha-
doria, 2004). Other flavonoids were reported from A. amara and A. adianthifolia (Arthur et al., 1978); however, this is the 
first report of flavonoids from the species A. zygia. 
In our study compounds 1-3 were tested against P. falciparum K1: compound 2 exhibited high antimalarial activity (IC50 
0.078 μg/ml), but displayed unfortunately also cytotoxic effects (IC50 0.405 μg/ml) against a cell line L6. 
The results of this phytochemical study of the bark of A. zygia are in agreement with previous data reported for other Albizia 
species  Arthur et al., 1978).
