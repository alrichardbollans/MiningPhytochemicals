O estudo dos extratos dos galhos da planta Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae) levou ao 
isolamento de alcalóides furoquinolínicos (dictamina, g-fagarina e esquimianina) e 2-arilquinolin-
4-ona (2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona) e limonóides (ácido limonéxico e limonina). Os compostos 
2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona e ácido limonéxico foram isolados pela primeira vez no gênero 
Spiranthera. Os alcalóides furoquinolínicos, 2-arilquinolin-4-ona e os limonóides mostraram 
atividade inseticida e/ou fungicida no ninho da formiga Atta sexdens rubropilosa.
The study of the Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil (Rutaceae) branches extracts led to the 
isolation of the furoquinoline (dictamine, g-fagarine and skimmianine) and 2-arylquinoli-4-one 
(1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one) alkaloids and limonoids (limonexic acid and limonin). The 
compounds 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one and limonexic acid were isolated for the first time 
from the Spiranthera. These furoquinoline and 2-arylquinoli-4-one alkaloids and limonoids showed 
insecticidal and/or fungicidal activity in the nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa.
Keywords: Spiranthera odoratissima, furoquinoline alkaloids, limonoids, Atta sexdens

Introduction
Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae), popularly 
know as Manacá, is a shrub found in the savannah and 
forest of Central Brazil, and in Bolivia.1 In folk medicine 
is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gout, kidney 
infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, acne and 
boil.2 According to Matos et al.,3 the ethanolic extract of 
the S. odoratissima roots contain compounds with analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory activity.
In previous phytochemical studies of S. odoratissima 
roots and leaves were reported to contain furoquinoline and 
b-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, coumarin, terpene, steroid 
and limonoids.4-5
Leaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera) are dominant herbivores 
in the tropics and can be found from the United States 
Southern to Northern Argentina countries.6 They cultivate a 
symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, 
thus they are considering plague.7 Therefore, the biological 
control of these insects has been the aim of many studies.
In this work was determined the toxicity of crude extract 
and compounds isolated from S. odoratissima branches in 
nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. 
Experimental
General experimental procedures
The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlations spectra 
were obtained using Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, with 
CDCl3 and acetone-d6 using TMS as internal standard.
Terezan et al. 883Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010
For ESIMS analysis, low resolution, was used on triple 
quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument. GC/MS (EI) 
analysis was used a QP5000 Shimadzu, capillary column DB 
5MS (30 m, 0.25 mm id, film 0.25 mm). The temperature was 
programmed initially at 70 °C for 4 min, them increased with 
a rate of 10 °C min-1 to 280 °C respectively, injection volume 
was 1 mL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/
injector were 300 /280 °C. The mass selective detector at 
70 eV with scans from 50 to 500 u.
Plant material
Branches of S. odoratissima were collected in Rio 
Verde-Jataí, GO, Brazil in January/2001 and identified by 
Dr. José Rubens Pirani. Voucher specimens (4778) were 
deposited at the Institute of Bioscience herbarium of the 
University of São Paulo.
Compounds extraction and isolation 
The dried and powdered branches (1.1 kg) were 
subsequently extracted with n-hexane (1.9 g), CH2Cl2 
(7.2 g) and MeOH (16.7 g). The concentrated CH2Cl2 
extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over 
silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-
MeOH gradient. The CH2Cl2-EtOAc fraction (4.1 g) was 
chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluting 
with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to give 
3 fractions A-C. Fraction A (34.4 mg) was fractionated as 
above, n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient. The fraction A-1 
(15.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-
CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 1 (7.8 mg). Fraction B (689.3 mg) 
was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH 
gradient yielding 26 fractions. The fraction B-15 (37.0 mg) 
was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2 
(1:4) yielding 2 (8.7 mg). Fraction B-16 (210.1 mg) was 
fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (3.5:6:0.5) 
and yielded 32 fractions. The fraction B-16.27 (44.5 mg) 
was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2-
acetone
 
(0.5:4:0.5) yielding 3 (7.4 mg). Fraction C (2.1  g) 
was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH 
gradient, yielding 70 fractions. The fraction C-34 
(397.5 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-
EtOAc-MeOH gradient and fraction C-34.86 was purified 
by preparative TLC using CH2Cl2-acetone (4:1) and yielded 
4 (18.0 mg). Fraction C-67 (40.4 mg) was fractionated 
by TLC using CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:3) yielding 5 (5.0 mg). 
The concentrated MeOH extract was submitted to liquid 
partition with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The 
union of the n-hexane and CH2Cl2 fractions (510.0 mg) 
was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with 
MeOH, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (4:1, 3:2 and 1:1) to give 38 frations. 
Fraction 22 (89.0 mg) was submitted to centrifugational 
chromatography (Cromatroton) using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-
EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 10 fractions. Fraction 
22-2 (20.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using 
n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (1:8:1) and yielded 6 (16.0 mg).
Identification of the isolated compounds
The isolated compounds were identified using NMR, 
MS techniques. The furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamine 
(1), g-fagarine (2) and skimmianine (3) presented spectral 
data in agreement with the literature.8-9 1-Methyl-2-

Fungicidal bioassay
The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer) 
Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from an 
Atta sexdens rubropilosa laboratory nest.
The medium for fungus maintenance and methods 
for the bioassays were previously described.12 Solvent 
(n-hexane or dichloromethane or methanol) or solution of 
each extract or solution of compounds (1.0 mL) were added 
to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose 
(10.0), sodium chloride (5.0), peptone (5.0), malt extract 
(10.0) and agar (15.0). Control tubes received 1.0 mL of 
solvent and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes 
were autoclaved at 121 °C by 15 min and then slanted. 
The final concentration of n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH 
extracts were 1000 µg mL-1 and of the compounds 1, 2 and 
3 were 50 µg mL-1. The fungal suspension was prepared 
by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained 
from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an 
all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1.0 g L-1) 
and gently fragmented. This suspension (1.0 mL) was 
spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 
25 (±1) °C for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two 
sets of five tubes each). Fungal growth was estimated 
macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and 
density using the modal value.
Leaf-cutting ant insecticide biossay
The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays 
were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had 
Activities of Extracts and Compounds from Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.884
a body mass of 20-25 mg. Before the assays the nests 
were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat 
seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such 
as Hibiscus sp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants 
were removed from the nests and put into five Petri dishes 
(ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assay the 
ants were maintained on an artificial diet prepared with 
glucose (50.0 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10.0 g L-1), yeast 
extract (1.0 g L-1), and agar (15.0 g L-1), in distilled water 
(100 mL).13 The diet (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of 
compounds (experiment) or without (control) were offered 
daily in a small plastic cap. The control was prepared 
with the diet and the solvent. To ensure that undetectable 
remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, 
a comparison made with another set of dishes in which 
water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same 
survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not 
shown). The compounds were poured into the hot diet 
immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration 
of the extracts added to the diet were 2000 mg mL-1 and 
of the compounds 100 mg mL-1 or 500 mg mL-1. During 
the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at 
a temperature 25 (±1) °C and relative humidity ranging 
between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation 
was 25 days and number of dead ants was registered daily.
The survival median 50% (S50) was calculated and 
survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted 
software Graph-Pad™ using the log-rank test.
Results and Discussion
The compounds isolated from dichloromethane crude 
extract of the S. odoratissima branches were dictamine8 
(1), g-fagarine9 (2), skimmianine8 (3), 1-methyl-2-
phenylquinolin-4-one (4), limonexic acid (5) and limonin 
(6) (Figure 1). The 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) 
and limonexic acid (5) were isolated for the first time from 
the Spiranthera. 
Compounds 1-3 were identified by comparison of NMR 
spectral data with those described in the literature,8,9 and 
the structures of compounds 4, 5 and 6 were confirmed 
on the basis of 1H NMR, EIMS and ESIMS spectra, and 
carbon attributions that were made by HSQC and HMBC 
correlation spectra. 
The S. odoratissima branches crude extracts showed 
high inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth 
and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present 
insecticidal activity on A. sexdens rubropilosa ants. 
The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol crude 
extract (1000 mg mL-1) showed 100% of inhibitory activity 
on symbiotic fungus (L. gongylophorus). The activities of 
compounds 1-3 were comparable to those of extracts above. 
However, 1 and 2 were more fungicide than 3, the two first 
inhibiting fungus growths at 100% and the later 80%. The 
compounds 4, 5 and 6, were not tested in this bioassay. 
These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids are 
the potentially active compounds in the fungicidal bioassay 
of dichloromethane crude extract. The fungicidal activity 
of furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine, 
maculine, dictamine, flindersiamine and quinolone obtained 
from Rutaceae family,10,14 already had been described in 
literature as powerful inhibitors of symbiotic fungus growth.
The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts 
were tested in ants (A. sexdens rubropilosa) ingestion 
bioassay (Table 1) and dichloromethane and methanolic 
extracts present insecticidal activity. In contrast with high 
fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids against the 
symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ants, the ingestion 
bioassay showed that compounds 1 and 2 showed weak 
activity in ants ingestion assay, which had S50 ranging from 
11.0 and 14.0, respectively, while in the control S50 was 
15.0. Only compound 1 presented statistic difference in 
comparison with control (Table 2), according to the log-
rank test (p < 0.05), which considered all tested period. 
Compound 3 was tested in previous work15 and showed not 
be toxic to the leaf-cutting ants. Compounds 4-6 isolated 
from dichloromethane and methanolic extracts showed 
toxicity against leaf-cutting ants (Table 3). The ants survival 
median (S50) were in the 7th and 4th day of the experiment, 
respectively, compared with the control (S50 = 12 days) for 
Figure 1. Molecular structures of the compounds isolated from 
S. odoratissima branches extracts: 1: dictamine, 2: g-fagarine, 
3: skimmianine, 4: 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one, 5: limonexic acid 
and 6: limonin.
Terezan et al. 885Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010
1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonin (6) in 
concentration of 500 mg mL-1. For limonexic acid (5), the 
most potent compound, at concentration of 500 mg mL-1, the 
survival median (S50) of the ants were in the 3rd day of the 
experiment and 98% mortality occurred at the 17th day. This 
latter result was also observed by Biavatti et al.16 Therefore, 
these results indicate that the compounds 4-6 are potentially 
active compounds against A. sexdens rubropilosa.
The potential insecticidal and fungicidal activities of 
the S. odoratissima extracts and of the compounds isolated 
from the dichloromethane and methanolic extracts suggest 
the use of this plant in the nest of the leaf-cutting ants 
control, and the continuation of the investigation of the 
S. odoratissima bioactive compounds.
