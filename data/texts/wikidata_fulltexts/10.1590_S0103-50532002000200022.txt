Do extrato hexânico da casca do caule de Bombacopsis glabra (Bombacaceae) foram isolados
a flavona 5-hidroxi-3,6,7,8,4’-pentametoxiflavona (1) e os triterpenos lupenona, 9,19-ciclolanost-
23-eno-3β,25-diol (2), (24R)-9,19-ciclolanost-25-eno-3β,24-diol (3) e (24S)-9,19-ciclolanost-25-
eno-3β,24-diol (4). As estruturas foram determinadas por espectroscopia de RMN de 13C e de 1H
(1D e 2D) e EM, e ainda, por comparação com dados da literatura para os triterpenos. A confirmação
inequívoca da estrutura da flavona 1 foi realizada por um estudo de difração de raios X. As cinco
substâncias foram isoladas pela primeira vez de espécies de Bombacaceae.
The flavone 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (1) and the triterpenes lupenone, 9,19-
cyclolanost-23-ene-3β,25-diol (2), (24R)-9,19-cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol (3) and (24S)-9,19-
cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol (4) were isolated from the hexane extract of the stem bark of
Bombacopsis glabra (Bombacaceae). The structures were determined by 13C and 1H NMR (1D and
2D) and mass spectrometry, and by comparison with literature data for triterpenes. The structure of
the flavone 1 was unambiguously confirmed by a X-ray diffraction study. The five substances were
isolated for the first time from Bombacaceae species.
Keywords: Bombacopsis glabra, Bombacaceae, triterpenes, 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-

Introduction
The Bombacaceae family comprises 28 genera and 200
species.1 Despite the economic significance of Ceiba and
Ochroma species as sources of kapok and balsa wood,
respectively, little is known about the chemistry of plants
from this family.2,3 As part of our program of study of the
Brazilian flora, we have carried out the first investigation
of the chemical constituents of the bark from Bombacopsis
glabra (Pasq.) A. Robyns.
B. glabra [syn. Pachira glabla pasq., Pachira
macrocarpa (Schlecht. Et Cham.) Walp., Bombax glabrum
(Pasq.) A. Robyns and Bombax aquaticum (Aubl.) Schum]
is a plant native to the Brazilian Atlantic forest and can be
found from the State of Pernambuco in the northeast to
Rio de Janeiro in the southeast.4
This study led to the isolation of the polyoxygenated
flavone (1) and of the triterpenes lupenone , 9,19-
cyclolanost-23-ene-3β,24-diol (2), (24R)-9,19-
cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol (3) and (24S)-9,19-
cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol (4). The five compounds
are reported for the first time in plants from Bombacaceae
family. Compound 1 is structurally similar to flavones with
citotoxic5,6 and insect antifeedant properties.7 The structure
elucidation of the isolated compounds was performed by
spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data.
The unambiguous assignments of 1H and 13C NMR data of
1, 2 and 3 was performed by 1H1H-COSY, HMQC, HMBC
and nOe difference NMR experiments. The structure of 1
was also confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
Results and Discussion
Although compound 1 has been previously
synthesised8 and isolated from Stachys aegyptiaca9 but a
277Chemical Constituents from Bombacopsis glabra (Pasq.) A. RobynsVol. 13, No. 2, 2002
full 1H NMR assignment have not been made. In the present
study, all 1H and 13C shifts were unambiguously and directly
assigned by HMQC, HMBC and nOe difference
experiments.
The 2JHC and 3JHC couplings by HMBC are shown in
Figure 1. Also, 1H-1H nOe enhancements were seen from
H2’,6’ to 13-CH3 (1.3 %) and 15-CH3 (1.0 %) and from 12-
CH3 to the almost overlapping resonances of 11-CH3 and/
or 13-CH3 (2.3 % in total). These enhancements defined
the structure unambiguously, with only trivial reliance on
shift data. The complete assignments are listed in Table 1.
The crystal structure of 1 (Figure 2) confirmed the
substitution pattern deduced from NMR. The benzopyran
ring (C) is essentially coplanar with ring A. However, the
methoxyphenyl ring (B) is twisted 23º from the plane of
ring C. A similar result has been found for other flavones.10
The methoxy group lies in the plane of the phenyl ring.
This is in agreement with Bolt and Bauch11 where the methyl
groups of -methoxynaphthalene derivatives lie in the plane
of the aromatic ring, syn to Cα. However, the methoxy
groups at carbons C3, C6, C7 and C8 are not coplanar with
ring A, their torsion angles being 110.8(4)º, 66.7(6)º,
-62.1(5)º and -74.0(5)º respectively, presumably because
of steric hindrance. In contrast, one of the methyl groups
in the slightly less hindered 8-hydroxy-1,2,3-trimethoxy-
benzo[a]anthracene-7,12-dione, lies in the plane of the
aromatic ring.12
Although pre-irradiation at  δ 8.17 (H2'+H6') resulted
in a nOe enhancement at 15-CH3 (1.0%), compatible with
the crystal structure [15-CH3…H2', 3.2 Å], the enhancement
observed at H13 (1.3%) cannot be explained from the
crystal structure [13-CH3…H6' 4.2 Å]. This implies that in
solution the C8-O6 bond has alternative conformations to
bring 13-CH3 closer to H6'.
An intramolecular hydrogen bond exists between O3
and O2 [O3…O2 2.572(4) Å; H3…O2 1.61(9) Å; O3-H3
1.02(9) Å; O3-H3…O2 156(8)]. This is consistent with the
absence of nOe enhancement at 11-CH3 upon irradiation
of H3 (Figure 2).

Compound 2 showed thirty resonances signals in the
13C NMR spectrum (6 C, 7 CH, 10 CH2 and 7 CH3) and the
signals at δ 79.3 and 71.2 suggested the presence of two
hydroxyl groups. The EI mass spectrum presented a peak at
m/z 424 [M-18, loss of water from the molecular ion]. These
data were consistent with the molecular formula C30H50O2.
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 showed, besides other
signals, resonances for cyclopropane methylene (δ 0.54 and
0.31, 1H, d, each), seven methyls and two olefinic hydrogens
(δ 5.59, m) suggesting a cycloartenol type triterpene. The
detailed analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra led us to
propose the structure of 9,19-cyclolanost-23-ene-3β,25-diol.
The 23Z isomer has been previously isolated13 and also the
3-acetate of this compound, having a E double bond.14 As
the signals of H-23 and H-24 appeared as a multiplet centered
at δ 5.59, a direct assignment of the double bond geometry
was difficult, but the data were similar to those reported by
Greca et al13 for the Z isomer. Using two-dimensional NMR
techniques (COSY, HMQC and HMBC), it was possible to
assign unequivocal the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Some of
the 13C NMR assignments made by us differ slightly from
those given by Greca et al.,13 but were in full agreement with
the data reported by Kamisato et al.15 Although compound
2 was identified many years ago, only now a complete
unambiguous assignment of the 1H NMR spectrum has been
achieved.
Compound 3 was isolated as a white solid and its 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra were similar to those of
compound 2. The EIMS showed a peak at m/z 442,
corresponding to the molecular formula C30H50O2,
suggesting that 3 was an isomer of 2. The major differences
were relative to the signals corresponding to the side chain.
In the 1H NMR spectrum, resonances at δ 4.95 (m) and
another at δ 4.82 (m) were observed, consistent with the
presence of a =CH2 group, and this was confirmed by the
signals at δ 147.36 (C-25) and 111.31 (C-26) in the 13C
NMR spectrum. Furthermore, the location of the double
bond between C-25 and C-26 was proposed, due to the
absence of Me-26 signal at δ 1.7, when compared with
corresponding signal in the 1H NMR spectrum of the
compound 2, and also by the coupling observed in the
1H1H-COSY spectrum between olefine hydrogen (H-26 and
H-26’) and Me-27.
The chemical shift at high frequency observed for H-
24 (δ 4.0, m), when compared with H-3, suggested that the
hydroxyl group should be placed next to the double bond
(at C-24). This position was further confirmed by couplings
observed in the 1H1H-COSY spectrum for the side chain
hydrogens: 21-CH3 and H-20; H-20 and H-22/H-22’; H-
22/H-22’ and H-23/H-23’; and finally, between H-23/H-
23’ and H-24.
Compounds 4 and 3 were obtained as a mixture. The
duplicity of most of the signals of the side chain, observed
in the 13C NMR spectrum of the mixture, and the
coincidence of the other signals, suggested that they are
epimers at C-24. By comparison of the 13C chemical shifts
of compounds 3 and 4 with literature data,14 they were
identified as (24R)-9,19-cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol
and (24S)-9,19-cyclolanost-25-ene-3β,24-diol, respecti-
vely. The complete assignments of the 13C NMR spectra of
compounds 2, 3 and 4 are shown in Table 2.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were determined on a MQAPF-301
apparatus and are uncorrected. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were obtained on a Bruker DPX 400 (at 400 MHz and
100.6 MHz, respectively) and DPX 300 (at 300 MHz and
75 MHz, respectively) instruments. HMQC and HMBC
experiments were optimized for 1JCH 145 Hz and 2 and 3JCH
7.7 Hz, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained on a V.G.
Analytical ZAB-IF spectrometer, at 70 eV. Infrared spectra
were registered on a Perkin Elmer FTIR PARAGON 1000
spectrophotometer. X-ray crystallographic data were
collected on a Siemens SMART CCD area-detector
diffractometer. UV data were obtained on a Varian CARY
50 spectrophotometer. Column chromatography and TLC
plates were prepared using silica gel Merck.
Plant material
Bombacopsis glabra (Pasq.) A. Robyns was collected
from Jequié region, Bahia State, Brazil and identified by
Dr. J. Semir (Universidade Estadual de Campinas). A
voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium UEC –
UNICAMP.
Extraction and isolation of chemical constituents
The air dried stem bark of B. glabra (850.0 g) was
ground and extracted with hexane (2.5 L) and ethanol (2.5
L) successively. The hexane extract was concentrated under
reduced pressure to leave a brown residue (24.0 g). This
gave 13 fractions following flash column chromatography
on silica gel, eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1 to
pure ethyl acetate). Fraction 5 (0.6 g) was purified by
chromatography using the same solvent system to yield
compound 1 (7.0 mg) and other eight subfractions.
Chromatographic separation of subfraction 5.4, using
hexane/ethyl acetate (7:3), yielded compound 3 (6.0 mg)
279Chemical Constituents from Bombacopsis glabra (Pasq.) A. RobynsVol. 13, No. 2, 2002
and a mixture of compounds 3 and 4 (8.0 mg). Fraction 2
(7.3 g) was chromatographed and eluted with hexane/ethyl
acetate (20:1) to yield lupenone (1.0 g). Fraction 6 was
dissolved in ethyl acetate. Compound 2 (10.0 mg),
insoluble in this solvent, was separated by filtration.

Crystal structure determination of compound 1
Crystals of 1 suitable for single crystal x-ray diffraction
studies were obtained as orange plates by recrystallization
from methanol. Data were collected using a Siemens
SMART CCD area-detector diffractometer. A multi-scan
absorption correction was applied using SADABS.16 The
structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-
matrix least-squares on F2 for all dara using SHELXL 97.17
Hydrogen atoms were added at calculated positions and
refined using a riding model. Anisotropic displacement
displacement parameters were used for all non-H atoms.
