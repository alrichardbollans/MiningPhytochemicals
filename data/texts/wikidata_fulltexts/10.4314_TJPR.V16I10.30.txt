Abstract 
Purpose: To provide an overview of the ethnomedicinal uses and pharmacological activities of Croton 
megalobotrys as to understand its potential value and importance in primary health care systems of 
local communities throughout its distributional range. 
Methods: The literature search for information on ethnomedicinal uses and pharmacological activities 
of C. megalobotrys was undertaken using databases such as Web of Science, BMC, Science Direct, 
Elsevier, Scopus, PubMed and Scielo. Other relevant literature sources included books, book chapters, 
websites, theses, conference papers and other scientific publications. 
Results: Croton megalobotrys is an important herbal medicine in southern Africa used as an 
abortifacient and purgative,and as remedy for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) opportunistic infections, malaria, muscle aches or pain, 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and skin infections. The chemical constituent of C. megalobotrys 
is mainly composed of alkaloids and cinnamate derivative isolated from the stem bark. The biological 
activities demonstrated include antibacterial, antiplasmodial, anti-HIV and radical scavenging activities. 
Conclusion: The historical traditional usage of C. megalobotrys as herbal medicine in southern Africa 
calls for detailed phytochemical and pharmacological properties of the species aimed at identifying the 
compounds responsible for its wide usage as an herbal medicine.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Medicinal plants play an important role in 
managing and treating human and animal 
diseases and ailments throughout the world. 
According to van Wyk et al [1], plants are an 
important primary source of most medicines in 
the world and they still continue to provide 
humans with new herbal medicines. It is within 
this context that the ethnomedicinal uses 
pharmacological activities of Croton 
megalobotrys Mϋll. Arg. were evaluated. Croton 
megalobotrys is a member of the Croton genus 
of the Euphorbiaceae family, comprising about 
1300 species worldwide [2]. According to 
Salatino et al [2], several Croton species are 
widely used as traditional medicines in Africa, 
Asia and South America. Research by several 
authors [3-8] revealed that C. megalobotrys is an 
important medicinal plant used by both rural and 
urban communities throughout its native 
distributional range in tropical Africa. Croton 
megalobotrys is traded as medicinal plant in 
herbal medicine (muti) markets or shops in the 
Mpumalanga province in South Africa [9]. 
Research done by Tshisikhawe et al [10] showed 
that harvesting of stem bark of C. megalobotrys 
Maroyi 
Trop J Pharm Res, October 2017; 16(10): 2536  
 
for medicinal purposes may threaten the survival 
of the species in the Limpopo province in South 
Africa where the species is harvested from the 
wild as herbal medicine. Therefore, this review is 
aimed at assessing if there is correlation 
between the ethnomedicinal uses of C. 
megalobotrys and the documented 
phytochemical and pharmacological properties of 
the species. It is hoped that this ethnomedicinal 
and pharmacological information will highlight the 
value and importance of C. megalobotrys as a 
potential source of a wide range of 
pharmaceutical products in southern Africa and 
will provide useful information to other 
researchers interested in the plant species.  
 
METHODS 
 
The literature search for information on 
ethnopharmacology and therapeutic value of C. 
megalobotrys (i.e., its ethnomedicinal uses, 
including other traditional uses, its botany, 
distribution, phytochemistry and pharmacological 
properties of the species) was performed from 
September 2016 to March 2017. Publications 
from all years included in databases such as 
BMC, Elsevier, PubMed, Scielo, Science Direct, 
Scopus and Web of Science were considered. 
Other literature sources were obtained from the 
library collections at the University of Fort Hare, 
Alice campus, South Africa, including scientific 
papers published in books, book chapters, 
international journals, theses, conference papers 
and other scientific publications. The keywords 
used in the search included “Croton 
megalobotrys”, the synonym of the species 
“Croton gubouga S. Moore”, and English names 
such as “fever bark”, “fever bark tree”, “fever-
berry”, “fever-berry croton”, “large fever-berry” 
and “lowveld croton”. All articles that appeared to 
meet the selection criteria were retrieved, and 
this review draws heavily on the research results 
published in international journals (33), books 
(13),websites (four), book chapters, dissertations 
and theses (three each),conference reports and 
scientific reports from international organizations 
(one each). Most of the ethnomedinal uses data 
on C. megalobotrys have been collected from 
Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Namibia, 
Mozambique, Malawi and Botswana. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Botanical profile of Croton megalobotrys 
 
The generic name “Croton” was derived from a 
Greek word “kroton” meaning thick, in reference 
to the thick and smooth seeds [11], a common 
feature of most Croton species which belong to 
the Crotonoideae subfamily of the 
Euphorbiaceae family [12-14]. The specific name 
“megalobotrys” was derived from Greek words 
meaning "big bunch of grapes" in reference to 
the big bunches of fruits, characteristic of the 
species [11,12,15,16]. The synonym of C. 
megalobotrys is C. gubouga S. Moore [12-16]. 
Croton megalobotrys has been recorded in 
Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, South 
Africa, Mozambique and Namibia (Figure 1). 
Croton megalobotrys is common in semi-
deciduous savannah, at medium to low altitudes 
on alluvial soils and usually a constituent of 
riverine and swamp fringe forest or thicket [12-
17]. 
 
Croton megalobotrys is a shrubby to medium-
sized, densely leafy tree reaching 15 m tall [17] 
with a stem up to 60 cm in diameter [13]. The 
bark is pale grey, smooth at first with vertical 
lines of lenticels, becoming rough and fissured in 
older trees. The leaves are ovate, roughly 
triangular with silvery green hairs on the under 
surface, 3-19 cm long and 1-13 cm wide [13]. 
The flowers are pale cream to yellowish green in 
colour, with either only male or female flowers or 
mixed and then with male flowers in upper part 
and one to several female flowers at the base 
[17]. The fruit is a rounded to ellipsoid drupe 
covered with whitish short hairs.

Vernacular names and traditional uses of 
Croton megalobotrys in southern Africa 
 
There appear to be a direct correlation between 
the number of vernacular names and the 
traditional uses of C. megalobotrys in southern 
Africa (Figure 2). Literature search revealed that 
C. megalobotrys has no fewer than 62 vernacular 
names in southern Africa (Table 1), with South 
Africa having 21 vernacular names followed by 
Botswana with 20, Zimbabwe with eight and 
Maroyi 
Trop J Pharm Res, October 2017; 16(10): 2537  
 
Namibia with six vernacular names (Table 1). 
Botswana has the highest number of uses of C. 
megalobotrys, 20 in total (Table 2) followed by 
South Africa with nine, Zimbabwe with seven and 
Malawi with six uses (Table 2). These findings 
support an observation made by Maroyi [18] that 
plant species characterized by several 
vernacular names implies that such species are 
useful to local people as theyrarely give 
vernacular names to plants that are not useful to 
them. This study revealed that C. megalobotrys 
has vernacular names and traditional uses in 
87.5% of the countries where it is indigenous 
(Tables 1 and 2), with the exception of Tanzania 
where no vernacular names or traditional uses 
have been recorded. Croton megalobotrys is 
commonly referred to as “fever-berry” in 62.5% of 
the countries where it is indigenous, these 
include Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Malawi 
and South Africa (Table 1). Croton megalobotrys 
got such a common name mainly because the 
seeds and bark of the species have considerable 
reputation among local communities as remedy 
for fever or malaria [12-14,17,19]. Literature 
records indicate that on 30 September 1899, a 
medical officer, Dr John Maberly used bark and 
seeds of C. megalobotrys mixed with opium 
(Papaver somniferum L.) as remedy for malaria 
[20]. According to Coates Palgrave [17], C. 
megalobotrys bark and seeds are well known 
among local communities in southern Africa and 
early pioneers in malarial areas not only as a 
cure for fever but also as a prophylactic. Other 
common names which allude to the usage of C. 
megalobotrys as herbal medicine for fever or 
malaria include “fever bark”, “fever bark tree”, 
“fever-berry cotton”, “large fever-berry” and “river 
fever-berry” (Table 1). The Afrikaans vernacular 
name “grootkoorsbessie” is a contraction of three 
words “groot”, “koors” and “bessie” which 
translate to “large”, “fever” and “berry” 
respectively in English, suggesting that the large 
fruits (berries) characteristic of the species are 
used against fever. 
 
The bark, fruits, leaves, roots and seeds of C. 
megalobotrys are used as herbal medicines for 
35 and two human and animal diseases 
respectively (Table 2). The bark or root infusion 
of C. megalobotrys is taken orally as an 
abortifacient and purgative or as herbal medicine 
for ascites also known as dropsy or pain in the 
alimentary canal in Malawi and Zimbabwe 
[4,5,39]. In Malawi, bark decoction of C. 
megalobotrys is applied on fresh wounds or cuts 
while leaf or root decoction is taken orally as 
remedy for headaches [7]. In Zimbabwe, root 
bark powder of C. megalobotrys is taken orally 
as remedy for female infertility [5] and bark or 
root decoction is taken orally as remedy for 
malaria [4]. Bark decoction of C. megalobotrys is 
also taken orally as herbal medicine for malaria 
in Mozambique [3] and Namibia [41]. In 
Botswana and South Africa, seeds or bark and 
root decoction of C. megalobotrys are taken 
orally as purgative [3,6,17,24,28,32] or as herbal 
medicine for fever or malaria [3,12,17,21,24,34] 
or berries are applied as poultices for skin 
infections or muscle aches or pain [24,35].

The bark, leaf, root or seed decoction of C. 
megalobotrys is taken orally as herbal medicine 
for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 
Zambia [37] and other STIs such as gonorrhoea 
in Zambia [38] and venereal diseases in South 
Africa [6]. Research done by Mabogo [6] 
revealed that seed decoction of C. megalobotrys 
is taken orally as herbal medicine for kidney 
problems and purification of the blood. In 
Botswana, root infusion of C. megalobotrys is 
taken orally for fattening babies [11] and seed 
decoction of the species is taken orally as 
laxative [22]. Recently, research done by Tietjen 
et al [8] in Botswana revealed that C. 
megalobotrys is widely used to treat or manage 
human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) 
opportunistic infections such as diarrhoea, loss of 
appetite and stomach problems.  
 
Croton megalobotrys is used as ethnoveterinary 
medicine by the resource-limited farmers in 
Botswana as an alternative to orthodox 
pharmaceuticals. Leaf decoction of C. 
megalobotrys is applied on lumpy skin [27] and 
bark or leaf decoction is also applied on animal 
sores or wounds [29]. Croton megalobotrys stem 
bark is widely used as a fish poison in Botswana 
[21,23], Mozambique [3] and South Africa [3,42]. 
Croton megalobotrys also provides varied 
products throughout its distributional range and 
these include construction poles, timber and 
firewood. According to Mutakela [43], C. 
megalobotrys is an important source of timber 
and other non-woody plant products in rural 
areas of Botswana. In Botswana, C. 
megalobotrys is browsed by game and livestock 
[44] and its leaf decoction is used as a pesticide, 
usually sprayed on arable land to kill worms [29]. 
Research by Hamilton et al. [45], and Raman 
and Kandula [46] showed that C. megalobotrys is 
used as a stimulant by chacma baboons (Papio 
ursinus). Chacma baboons in South Africa are 
known to consume each day a little quantity of 
leaves of the species, which is not classified as 
the baboon’s regular diet [45,46]. Consumption 
of C. megalobotrys is not directly related to any 
illness but for its stimulant activity [46]. Croton 
megalobotrys is planted as an ornamental and 
shade plant in rural areas of Botswana [29]. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Correlation between ethnomedicinal uses and 
pharmacological activities of C. megalobotrys 
 
Aligning the available ethnomedicinal information 
about C. megalobotrys in southern Africa, it 
appears that the species is most commonly used 
as anabortifacient, fish poison, purgative and as 
herbal medicine for the treatment and 
management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic 
infections, malaria and STIs (Figure 3). Several 
other Croton species including C. macrostachyus 
Hochst. ex Delile, C. megalocarpus Hutch. and 
C. sylvaticus Hochst. ex C. Krauss. are widely 
used as purgatives [48-50]. The seeds of C. 
tiglium L. are the sources of a commercially 
produced and marketed croton oil widely used as 
a purgative [2]. Croton megalobotrys also plays 
an important role in the treatment and 
management of HIV/AIDS and malaria which 
were classified among the top five killer diseases 
in Africa in 2012 by the World Health 
Organization. Research by Ramjee et al. [51] 
revealed that STIs are among the most prevalent 
infectious diseases worldwide and approximately 
1 million women in Africa die yearly due to 
infection with HIV/AIDS and STIs. Whilst C. 
megalobotrys has proved to be useful over the 
centuries as herbal medicine for some of these 
important diseases in Africa, no meaningful 
Maroyi 
Trop J Pharm Res, October 2017; 16(10): 2539  
 
phytochemical and pharmacological analyses 
exist in literature linking active principles of the 
species to its ethnomedicinal uses. 
 
Apart from 4-hydroxyhygric acid isolated from the 
bark of C. megalobotrys by Goodson and Clewer 
[19] and a cinnamate derivative (E)-
tetratriacontyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-
propenate (Figure 4) isolated from the chloroform 
fraction of the stem bark extract by Abosi and 
Majinda [52], little is known about the chemical 
constituents of the species. But genus Croton is 
known to have a wide range of chemical 
compounds including alkaloids, cardenolides, 
diterpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, mono and 
sesquiterpenoids [2,53]. The diterpenoids 
isolated from other species of the Croton genus 
are regarded as toxic irritants of the skin and 
mucosas [54] and they produce a burning 
sensation in the throat and mouth [3,19]. 
 
Selowa et al [35] evaluated antibacterial activities 
of n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, 
acetone and methanol leaf powder extract of C. 
megalobotrys against Gram negative bacteria 
Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, and 
Gram positive bacteria Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using 
bioautograph and micro-dilution techniques.

All extracts showed antibacterial activities, with 
the highest activity observed against 
Enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) value of 0.02 mg/ml [35]. 
These findings somehow support the species’ 
antibacterial potential and its usefulness in its 
traditional usage as herbal medicine for 
diarrhoea [8], gonorrhoea [38], skin infections 
[24,35], STIs [37], stomach problems [8] and 
venereal diseases [6]. More research is 
recommended focusing on antibacterial activities 
of C. megalobotrysagainst known bacterial 
pathogens such as Neissseria gonorrhoeae 
which cause gonorrhoea, and other bacterial 
pathogens such as Shigella dysenterae, Shigella 
flexneri and Vibrio cholerae which cause gastro-
intestinal infections. 
 
Abosi and Majinda [52] evaluated antiplasmodial 
activities of root, stem bark and leaf extracts of 
C. megalobotrys in NMRI white albino mice 
infected with 1 x 107Plasmodium berghei (ANKA) 
parasitized erythrocytes. The effects of the 
extracts were assessed on early infection, 
established infection and the residual effect of 
the extracts was also assessed using the 
Repository or Prophylactic test. The stem bark 
extract produced a suppressive effect of 74.5 % 
in early infection and a residual inhibitory effect 
of 86.9 %. In an established infection, a mean 
survival time of 16.2 days was achieved although 
parasitaemia was not completely eliminated. 
Antiplasmodial activity was observed in in vitro 
test with IC50 values of 1.74 ± .47 μg/ml and 3.78 
± 1.03 μg/ml for the hexane fraction of the stem 
bark extract against chloroquine sensitive (D6) 
and chloroquine-resistant (W2) strains of 
Plasmodium falciparum respectively [52]. The 
antiplasmodial activity demonstrated in this study 
support the folkloric use of C. megalobotrys for 
treating and managing malaria in southern Africa 
and also using the species as prophylactic 
medicine for malaria [3,4,20,21,24]. Previous 
research by Ndunda [53] revealed that over 70 % 
of species belonging to the Croton genus 
reported in ethnomedicinal treatment of malaria 
and tested for antiplasmodial activities were 
found to be active, an indication of the potential 
of these species as antimalarial remedies. The 
preliminary radical scavenging evaluation carried 
out by Abosi and Majinda [52]using the 
chloroform fraction in qualitative 2,2-diphenyl-1-
picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed activity at a 
loading dose of 0.05 μg, thus exhibiting radical 
scavenging activity comparable to that of 
ascorbic acid. Collectively, data obtained by 
Abosi and Majinda [52] indicate that C. 
megalobotrys suppresses free radical formation, 
however, determining the exact mechanisms of 
action will require further investigations.

Tietjen et al [8] evaluated the crude extracts of C. 
megalobotrys for in vitro cytotoxicity and 
inhibition of wild-type (NL4.3) and ARV-resistant 
HIV-1 replication in an immortalized GFP-
reporter CD4+ T-cell line. The study by Tietjen et 
al [8] is based on the wide use of C. 
megalobotrys as herbal medicine for treating and 
managing HIV/AIDS in Botswana where in some 
cases the species is used concurrently with 
standard ARVs. Croton megalobotrys bark 
extracts inhibited HIV-1NL4.3 replication with 
dose-dependence and without concomitant 
cytotoxicity and inhibited HIV-1 replication by a 
maximum of 45 % at concentrations as low as 
0.05 mg/ml. According to Tietjen et al [8],C. 
megalobotrys extracts did not interfere with 
antiviral activities of licensed ARVs when applied 
in combination and exhibited comparable 
efficacies against viruses harboring major 
resistance mutations to licensed protease, 
reverse-transcriptase, or integrase inhibitors. 
Based on these findings, C. megalobotrys can 
therefore, be administered in parallel with 
Western HIV/AIDS treatments in managing the 
effects of HIV/AIDS in Botswana, a disease that 
has become a devastating epidemic in sub-
Saharan Africa [55]. 
 
Toxicity evaluation 
 
A number of ethnobotanical studies have 
highlighted the toxicity of C. megalobotrys when 
used as herbal medicine. Croton megalobotrys is 
a well-known poisonous plant in South Africa 
[32,56] and Zimbabwe [4,5,40,57], although it is 
widely used as herbal medicine in both countries. 
According to Gelfand et al [5], taking of bark and 
root of C. megalobotrys has been reported to 
cause swelling of testicles in Zimbabwe. Mabogo 
[6] emphasized the need to follow traditional 
healers’ dosage instructions when using C. 
megalobotrys as a purgative, since there is a 
possibility of fatal side effects. It is commonly 
recommended that an adult should take one or 
three quarters of a seed at a time [6]. Preliminary 
toxicity investigations showed that ground bark of 
C. megalobotrys caused purgation and emesis in 
dogs, but rabbits were less sensitive although in 
doses of 1 g/kg of body weight induced diarrhoea 
[19]. In human beings, administration of C. 
megalobotrys bark causes intense burning 
sensation in the throat, salivation and slight 
nausea with slight laxative effect [3,19]. The 
toxicity effects of C. megalobotrys are attributed 
to toxic diterpenes which are characteristic of 
most species belonging to the Croton genus [58]. 
No detailed cytotoxicity or toxicity effects of C. 
megalobotrys have been undertaken recently, 
although it is clear that detailed toxicity studies 
for such a widely used medicinal plant in 
southern Africa are required. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The historical traditional usage of C. 
megalobotrys as herbal medicine in southern 
Africa calls for detailed phytochemical and 
pharmacological properties of the species aimed 
at identifying the compounds responsible for its 
wide usage as herbal medicine. At the present 
moment, there is not yet enough systematic data 
regarding phytochemistry, pharmacological 
properties and clinical research of C. 
megalobotrys extracts and compounds. There 
are very few to nil experimental studies, clinical 
research trials and target-organ toxicity studies 
involving C. megalobotrys extracts and its 
compounds that have been carried out so far. 
Given this background, it is quite difficult to 
correlate the ethnomedicinal uses of the species 
with the few phytochemical profiling and 
pharmacological evaluations that have been 
done so far. There is need therefore, to evaluate 
pharmacological properties of the species, as 
these may be directly related to the species 
ethnomedicinal uses. Detailed pharmacological 
studies will provide some insight into the 
therapeutic potential of C. megalobotrys. Since 
C. megalobotrys is classified as poisonous in 
southern Africa [4-6,32,40,56], there is need for a 
detailed toxicological assessment of the species 
using reliable analytical methods.
