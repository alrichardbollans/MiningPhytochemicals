The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of extensive 2D NMR (1H-1H COSY or DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, TOCSY, and HSQC-TOCSY) spectroscopic, ESIMS, and chemical methods. Saponins 1, 3, 6, and 7showed cytotoxicity against human head and neck squamous cells (JMAR, MDA1986) and melanoma cells (B16F10, SKMEL28)with IC50 values in the range 1.8-12.4 μM, using the MTS assay.The genus Albizia (Fabaceae) is composed of about 150species widely distributed in the tropics, with the greatestdiversity encountered in Africa and Central and South America.1Triterpene saponins from several species (A. grandibracteata, A.gummifera, A. julibrissin) have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicactivity in vitro against different cancer cell lines.2-5 As part of acontinuing investigation to identify bioactive compounds fromnatural sources, a library of 200 plant extracts from LatinAmerica was screened for cytotoxic activity in vitro againsttwo human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)cell lines as well as two melanoma cell lines. Albizia inundata(Martius) Barneby & Grimes, a perennial tree from Argentina,was one of the most active plant samples in the MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfo-phenyl)-2H tetrazolium] assay. The CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1)extract of the aerial parts of this species showed cytotoxicityto JMAR and MDA1986 HNSCC cells and B16F10 andSKMEL28 melanoma cells with IC50 values in the range1.0-3.8 μg/mL. This extract was selected for bioassay-guidedfractionation, purification, and isolation of its active constitu-ents. We report herein the details of the isolation, structureelucidation, and cytotoxicity of two new natural oleanane-typesaponins (1, 2) and seven previously reported saponins (3-9).This is the first report of a bioassay-guided phytochemical studyof this species.The active crude CH2Cl2-MeOH extract of A. inundata (80 g)was divided into fractions soluble in hexane (5 g), EtOAc (17 g),n-BuOH (40 g), and water (12 g), by a liquid-liquid partitioningprocess. Bioassay results showed that the n-BuOH frac-tion showed the highest activity of all fractions tested, withcytotoxicity against the four cancer cell lines used (B16F10,JMAR, MDA1986, and SKMEL28) with IC50 values in the range0.1-1.0 μg/mL. The n-BuOH fraction (36 g) was furtherseparated into six fractions by MCI gel CHP20P columnchromatography, eluted by 100% water (fraction 1), 20%MeOH(fraction 2), 40% MeOH (fraction 3), 60% MeOH (fraction 4),85%MeOH (fraction 5), and 100%MeOH (fraction 6). Fraction5 (16 g) showed the highest activity against the four cancer celllines tested, with IC50 values in the range 0.1-0.9 μg/mL. Thisfraction was further separated on a Si gel column eluted byCH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O (from 20:1:0.1 to 4:1:0.1). Furtherpurification of the most active fraction [eluted by CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O (7:1:0.1), with IC50 values in the range 0.4-2.5μg/mL against the above four cancer cell lines] by semiprepara-tive HPLC (mobile phase CH3CN-H2O) resulted in theisolation of two new natural saponins (1 and 2) and sevenknown saponins (3-9). The 1H and 13C NMR data indicatedthat compounds 1-9 are oleanene-type saponins.

Prod. 2011, 74, 477–482Journal of Natural Products NOTEof fraction 5 were determined as L-arabinose, D-glucose, andD-xylose.Compound 1, obtained as an amorphous powder, was foundto have the molecular formula C43H69NO12 as determinedthrough HRESIMS (positive mode, [M þ H]þ peak at m/z792.4869, calcd for C43H70NO12, 792.4898; [MþNa]þ peak atm/z 814.4697, calcd for C43H69NO12Na, 814.4717) and NMRexperiments. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed thepresence of eight methyl groups at δ 0.79, 0.97, 0.98, 1.00,1.04, 1.15, 1.28, and 2.16 (each 3H, s). Further features weresignals observed at δ 3.17 (1H, dd, J = 12.5, 4.7 Hz, typical for anaxial proton attached to a hydroxylate carbon), at δ 4.95 (1H, d,J = 6.6 Hz), 4.98 (1H, d, J = 8.3 Hz), and 5.46 (1H, brt, J = 3.0 Hz,assignable to a vinylic proton), and at δ 8.94 (1H, d, J = 9.1 Hz).The 13C NMR spectrum (DEPT) of 1 (Table 1) displayed aquaternary carbon signal at δ 180.7 (suggesting the presence of aCOOH group), a quaternary carbon signal at δ 170.5 (ester oramide carbon), and two olefinic carbon signals (one quaternaryat δ 145.2 and onemethine at δ 123.1, suggesting the presence ofa double bond). The spectrum also showed two signals at δ 105.8(CH) and 105.6 (CH) assignable to anomeric carbons of twosugar units. On the basis of these data, 1 was determined to be atriterpene diglycoside with a triterpene acid moiety of anoleanene skeleton. The assignments of the 1H and 13C NMRsignals of the triterpene moiety were secured by HSQC, 1H-1HCOSY, and HMBC experiments, which allowed for the identi-fication of the aglycon as oleanolic acid. The presence of anoleanolic acid moiety in 1 was further supported by 1H and 13CNMR data, which were similar to those obtained for the othertriterpene saponins isolated in this study, including 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(lf2)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (5),6,73-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(lf6)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid (6),8 and 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl(1f2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(lf6)]-β-D-gluco-pyranosyl oleanolic acid (7).8 The structure of 1 was confirmedby a complete acid hydrolysis of this compound, which affordedthe aglycon oleanolic acid as identified by co-TLC with anauthentic sample available in our laboratory.Glycosylation of the alcoholic function at C-3 in the triterpenemoiety was indicated by the low-frequency chemical shift value ofthis carbon resonance (δ 89.7) and HMBC correlations betweenH-3 (δ 3.17, dd, J = 12.5, 4.7 Hz) and one anomeric carbon at δ105.6 (C-10) and between one anomeric proton at δ 4.98 (H-10,d, J = 8.3 Hz, which correlated to the anomeric carbon C-10 at δ105.6 in the HSQC spectrum) and C-3 (δ 89.7). From theanomeric proton in each sugar unit, the other protons in 1 wereassigned using 1H-1H COSY and TOCSY spectra, after whichthe glycosidic carbons were identified from an analysis of theHSQC spectra (Table 1). In the diglycosidic moiety, one sugarwas identified as an R-arabinopyranosyl unit, and the other as anN-acetylated amino-β-glycopyranosyl unit. The presence of anN-acetamido group was suggested by IR absorption peaks (1630and 1560 cm-1) and the detection of signals at δH 8.94 (1H, d,J = 9.1 Hz, NHCOCH3), δH 2.16 (3H, s, NHCOCH3), δC 24.2(NHCOCH3), and δC 170.5 (NHCOCH3) as well as the HMBCcorrelations between δH 2.16 (NHCOCH3) and δC 170.5(NHCOCH3), between δH 4.58 (H-20, 1H, ddd, J = 8.3, 9.1,10.0 Hz) and δC 170.5 (NHCOCH3), and between δH 8.95(NHCOCH3) and δC 170.5 (NHCOCH3). The proton resonat-ing at δH 8.95 (NHCOCH3) showed a correlation in the1H-1HCOSY spectrum with the signal at δH 4.58 (H-20, attached toC-20 at δ 58.3 in the HSQC spectrum). The shielding of C-20 atδC 58.3 is characteristic for the presence of a 2-deoxy-2-acet-amidoglycosyl unit. The large proton coupling constant of H-20indicated the trans-diaxial orientation of H-20 of the N-acetylglu-cosamine. Furthermore, the HMBC correlations between δH4.32, 3.78 (H2-60 in Glc-NAc) and δC 105.8 (C-100 in Ara) andbetween δH 4.95 (H-100 in Ara) and δC 70.4 (C-60 in Glc-NAc)allowed for the determination of the sequence of the glycosidicchains linked to C-3. Finally, the 13C NMR data obtained for thediglycosidic chain were superimposable with those obtained for3-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl echinocystic acid (3),7 also isolated in this study.From these observations, 1 was determined as 3-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyra-nosyl oleanolic acid. Although the structure of 1 was previouslyreported as a result of a partial acid hydrolysis of oleanolic acid3-O-glycosides from the stems ofA. subdimidiata,1 we report herefor the first time its 1H and 13C NMR data based on 2D NMRspectroscopic analyses.The structure determination of 2 was performed in a sim-ilar manner to that described for 1. Its molecular formulaof C48H75NO17 was determined through HRESIMS (positivemode, [MþH]þ peak atm/z 938.5061, calcd for C48H76NO17,938.5113; [M þ Na]þ peak at m/z 960.4890, calcd forC48H75NO17Na, 960.4933) and NMR experiments. The IRabsorption peak at 1760 cm-1 suggested the presence of aγ-lactone ring. The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1) showedthe presence of eight methyl groups at δ 0.79 (6H, s), 0.93, 1.01,1.08, 1.22, 1.38, and 2.18 (each 3H, s), an axial proton attached toa hydroxylated carbon at δ 3.39 (1H, dd, J = 11.5, 4.3 Hz), threeanomeric protons at δ 5.06 (1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz), 5.07 (1H, d, J =6.5 Hz), and 5.14 (1H, d, J = 5.1 Hz), a vinylic proton at δ 5.32(1H, brt, J = 2.7 Hz), and an amide proton δ 8.94 (1H, d, J = 8.8Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum (APT) of 2 (Table 1) displayedquaternary carbon signals at δ 181.7 (lactone ester carbon),170.5 (amide carbon), and 140.5 (double bond), one olefinicmethine at δ 125.09, and three anomeric carbon signals at δ479 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100702p |J.

Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 477–482Journal of Natural Products NOTE106.2, 105.5, and 102.9. Compound 2 was also determined to bea triterpene triglycoside with an oleanene skeleton. The assign-ments of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of the triterpene moietywere secured by HSQC, DQF-COSY, and HMBC experiments,allowing for the identification of the aglycon as acacic acidlactone. The identification of the aglycon of 2 was supportedby its 1H and 13C NMR data, which were superimposable tothose obtained for the triterpene moiety, 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl-(lf2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(lf6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl acacic acid lactone (concinnoside D) (4),9-12also isolated in this study.The chemical shift at δ 89.3 observed for C-3 in the triterpe-noid ring system of 2, as well as the presence of three anomericcarbons, indicated that the three sugars in the molecule areattached to C-3. Starting from the three anomeric proton signalsattached to the three anomeric carbons in HSQC, the threesugars were identified as twoR-arabinopyranosyl units (Ara) andoneN-acetylated amino-β-glycopyranosyl unit (Glc-NAc), usingDQF-COSY, TOCSY, and HSQC-TOCSY techniques, evalua-tion of the coupling constants, and from the chemical shifts. Thisobservation was confirmed by acid hydrolysis of 2, whichafforded the sugar components, 2-amino-2-deoxyglucose andarabinose. The sugar unit with an anomeric signal at δH 5.06 (d, J =8.6 Hz) was assigned to 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-glucose. Thiswas further supported by the detection of signals at δH 8.94 (1H,d, J= 8.8Hz,NHCOCH3),δH 2.18 (3H, s, NHCOCH3),δC 24.2(NHCOCH3), and δC 170.5 (NHCOCH3) and by the HMBCcorrelations between δH 2.18 (NHCOCH3) and δC 170.5(NHCOCH3), between δH 4.60 (H-20) and δC 170.5(NHCOCH3), and between δH 8.94 (NHCOCH3) and δC170.5 (NHCOCH3) as well as the COSY correlation betweenthe proton at δH 8.94 (NHCOCH3) with that at δH 4.60 (H-20,attached to C-20 at δ 58.3 in the HSQC spectrum). The sugarunits with anomeric proton signals at δH 5.14 (H-100, d, J = 5.1Hz, attached to C-100 at δC 102.9) and δH 5.07 (H-1000, d, J = 6.5Hz, attached to C-1000 at δC 106.2) were attributed to two R-arabinose units. The connectivity of the sugar residues in thetrisaccharide chain was determined by a glycosylation shift of thecarbon signals and by HMBC correlations. The absence of any13C NMR glycosylation shift for one arabinopyranosyl unit (δ106.2, 73.3, 74.8, 69.4, and 67.1) suggested that this sugar is aterminal unit. Glycosylation shifts were observed for C-60 (δ69.9) of the Glc-NAc unit and for C-200 (δ 80.1) and C-100 (δ102.9) of the Ara unit. The HMBC correlations between H-3 (δ3.39) in the aglycon and C-10 (δ 105.5) in Glc-NAc and betweenH-10 (δ 5.06) in Glc-NAc and C-3 (δ 89.3) indicated that theGlc-NAc unit is linked directly to C-3 of the triterpenoid moiety.The HMBC correlations between H2-60 (δ 4.66, 4.22) in Glc-NAc and C-100 (δ 102.9) in one Ara, between H-100 (δ 5.14) inone Ara and C-60 (δ 69.9) in Glc-NAc, between H-200 (δ 4.57) inone Ara and C-1000 (δ 106.2) in the terminal Ara, and betweenH-1000 (δ 5.07) in the terminal Ara and C-600 (δ 65.0) in the otherAra allowed the determination of the sequence of the glycosidicchain linked to C-3. Finally, the 13C NMR data for the triglyco-sidic chain were superimposable with those obtained for 3-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)]-2-acet-amido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl echinocystic acid isolatedfrom A. procera.8 Therefore, 2 was determined as 3-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)]-2-aceta-mido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl acacic acid lactone.Saponins 2 and 4, 6 and 7, and 3-O-[R-L-arabinopyranosyl-(lf2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(lf2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside echinocystic acid (8)11 and 3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl(lf2)-R-L-arabinopyranosyl(1f6)-[β-D-gluco-pyranosyl(lf2)]-β-D-glucopyranoside echinocystic acid (9)11,13were determined to be three pairs of isomers. The only differencebetween these pairs is that the terminal sugar in 2, 6, and 8 isR-arabinose with a 4β-OH group, while that in 4, 7, and 9 isR-xylose with a 4R-OH group. 13C NMR data (especially thechemical shift value difference of C-2 due to the γ-gauche effect,and C-3 and C-4 due to an inductive effect) could be usedeffectively to differentiate between the two terminal sugars. Forexample, the chemical shifts observed for C-2, -3, and -4 in theterminal arabinose were δC 73.3, 74.8, and 69.4 in 2, δC 73.4,74.8, and 69.4 in 6, and δC 73.2, 74.8, and 69.5 in 8, while thoseobserved for the terminal xylose were δC 76.0, 78.4, and 71.4 in 4,7, and 9.Compounds 1, 3, 6, and 7 showed cytotoxicity againstB16F10, JMAR, MDA1986, and SKMEL28 cells, with IC50values in the range 1.8-12.4 μM (Table 2), while saponins 2,4, 5, 8, and 9 were inactive when tested at the higher concentra-tion of 20 μM. Although 1 and 3 share the same sugar moiety, thecytotoxic activity was increased when the oleanolic acid aglyconin 1 was replaced by the echinocystic (16-hydroxyoleanolic) acidaglycon in 3. While 1, 5, 6, and 7 have oleanolic acid as theiraglycon, 1, 6, and 7 showed activity, with 5 being inactive. Thisobservation suggests the importance of the presence of a C-20functional group (-OH or -NHCOCH3) in the glucose sugarunit attached to theC-3 position of the aglycon unit as in 1, 6, and7.This suggestion was supported by comparing the activities ofsaponins 3, 8, and 9. Compounds 3, 8, and 9 share the sameechinocystic aglycon, with 3 active with a C-20-NHCOCH3group in the glucose unit attached to C-3 of the aglycon, whilesaponins 8 and 9, with a C-20-Oglc group, proved to be inactive.’EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures.

For example,compound 3 was more potent against head and neck squamouscarcinoma [IC50 1.8 and 2.8 uM for MDA1986 and JMAR cells,respectively], while it was less potent against melanoma cell lines[IC50 5.1 and 9.2 uM for B16F10 and SKMEL28 cells, respectively],indicating, at concentrations tested, these compounds display specificcytotoxic effect rather than nonspecific saponin-mediated membranepermeabilization. Murine melanoma cells B16F10 and human melano-ma cells SKMEL28 both carry BRAF V600E mutation, whereasSKMEL28 cells carry additional PTEN mutation, which may explainincreased resistance to compound 3. In addition, phase-contrast micro-scopic examination of cells treated with increasing concentrations ofsaponins did not show membrane disintegration.481 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100702p |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 477–482Journal of Natural Products NOTEspectra were recorded with a Bruker AV-500 instrument with a cryop-robe for 1H, 13C (or APT), DEPT135, COSY (or DQF-COSY),TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, and HSQC-TOCSY. Chemical shift valuesare given in δ (ppm) using the peak signals of the solvent pyridine-d5 asreference, and coupling constants are reported in Hz. ESIMS weremeasured with an Agilent 1200 Series LC-MS/MS ion trap 6300 massspectrometer. HRESIMS data were collected with a LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Semiprepara-tive HPLC was performed on a Agilent 1200 unit with DAD detector,using a Lichrospher RP-18 column (250  10 mm, 5 μm) or a EclipseXDB-C18 column (150  4.6 mm, 5 μm). Normal-phase silica gel GTLC plates (w/UV 254) and reversed-phase C18 TLC plates (w/UV254) (Sorbent Technologies, Atlanta, GA) were used for fractiondetection. The spots were visualized using 254 nmUV light and sprayingwith 10% EtOH-sulfuric acid reagent.Cytotoxicity Bioassay. The in vitro antitumor cytotoxicity assayswere performed as previously described.14 In general, five concentra-tions ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/mL were tested for the extracts, and fiveconcentrations ranging from 50 nM to 20 μM were tested for purecompounds. Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA onranks test using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,CA). IC50 values were obtained from cell viability plots fitted with asigmoidal dose-response function with variable slope using GraphPadPrism 5 software.Plant Material. Aerial parts of A. inundata were collected by R.Fortunato and A. Cabral along highway RN 86, 2 km northeast ofPrimavera, Department Patino, Province of Formosa, Argentina (lat. 27 S,long. 58W), on August 11, 1999. A voucher specimen (No. ARP 645)identified by R. Fortunato was deposited in the Herbarium (BAB) of theInstitute of Biological Resources, National Institute of AgriculturalTechnology (INTA), Castelar, Buenos Aires, Argentina. IntellectualProperty Rights Agreements for plant collections and interdisciplinaryresearch have been executed between the collaborating institutions inthe U.S. and Argentina.Extraction and Isolation. Dried, ground biomass (870 g) wasextracted at room temperature with CH2Cl2-MeOH (50:50, 2 L) threetimes. The concentrated extract (80 g) was active with an IC50 value lessthan 2 μg/mL. The extract (79 g) was suspended in 300 mL of H2O,followed by partition with n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-butanol (3  500mL). The n-butanol fraction (40 g) was the most active one, with anIC50 value range of 0.1-1.0 μg/mL (see text), while the hexane fractionwas inactive and the EtOAc fraction showed an IC50 value rangeof 1.1-2.5 μg/mL. The n-butanol extract (36 g) was then subjectedto MCI gel CHP20P column chromatography (500 g, particle size75-150 μm, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), eluted with a mixtureof H2O-MeOH (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 85:15, 0:100), in order ofincreasing concentrations of methanol. The 85% MeOH fraction(fraction 5, 13.6 g) was subjected to passage over a silica gel column(300 g, particle size 10-25 μm), eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O(20:1:0, 20:1:0.1, 12:1:0.1, 7:1:0.1, 4:1:0.1) with increasing amounts ofMeOH and water. The fraction (3.2 g) eluted with CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O (7:1:0.1) was subjected to reversed-phase C18 Si gel columnchromatography (200 g, particle size 40-63 μm), eluted by MeOH-H2O (40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 65:35). Then the fractions were subjected tosemipreparative HPLC, with the mobile phase CH3CN-H2O(26:74; 28:72), to afford compounds 1 (4.2 mg), 2 (9.0 mg), 3 (20.1mg), 4 (9.7 mg), 5 (4.5 mg), 6 (4.4 mg), 7 (5.0 mg), 8 (19.0 mg), and9 (17.0 mg).Acid Hydrolysis of the Saponin Mixture of Fraction 5. An aliquot ofthe saponinmixture (fraction 5, 2.8 g) was dissolved in 100mL of 0.02NH2SO4-6.5% HClO4 (1:1) and refluxed for 5 h. The mixture was left tocool, diluted with H2O, and filtered, and the aqueous acid solution wasneutralized with 1 N KOH and then dried. The sugar mixture waspurified by preparative TLC, and the sugars isolated were compared withstandard sugars in EtOAc-2-propanol-Me2CO-H2O (20:10:7:6) forxylose or in CHCl2-MeOH-H2O (10:5:1) for arabinose and glucose.The optical rotations of the purified sugars were measured for D-glucose,[R]25D þ13 (c 0.1, H2O); D-xylose, [R]25D þ22 (c 0.1, H2O); and L-arabinose, [R]25D þ70 (c 0.1, H2O).3-O-[R-L-Arabinopyranosyl(1f6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glu-copyranosyl oleanolic acid (1):.
