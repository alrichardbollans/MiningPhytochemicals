Isoflavonoid Metabolism in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa 1.)'

Modest increases in the concentration of medicarpin, 6-fold in 
leaves and 4-fold in roots, were observed in alfalfa (Medicago 
sativa 1.) seedlings treated with 1 mM metal salts for 72 h. However, 
medicarpin-3-O-glucoside-6"-O-malonate (MGM) and formono- 
netin-7-0-glucoside-6"-O-malonate (FGM) levels were up to 50- 
fold lower in metal-treated compared to control roots. Approxi- 
mately 10% of the "missing" conjugates could be accounted for in 
the root treatment solution, where FGM and M G M  transiently 
accumulated prior to their hydrolysis. Time-course studies revealed 
that total isoflavonoid content (roots plus solution) increased 
slightly after CuCIz treatment, whereas the levels of FGM and M G M  
increased rapidly in alfalfa roots immersed in water. This increase 
was reduced by aeration. The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase inhib- 
itor i-a-aminooxy-j3-phenylpropionic acid was used to show that 
immersion of the roots reduced conjugate rates of degradation, 
which explains their accumulation. In contrast, conjugate rates of 
degradation were elevated in CuCIz-treated roots, with 50% of the 
increase being due to hydrolysis. Up to 90% of formononetin and 
medicarpin produced in response to CuCI, treatment arose via 
conjugate hydrolysis. Our results demonstrate that both immer- 
sion/anaerobiosis and abiotic elicitation modify isoflavonoid me- 
tabolism in alfalfa, and that metal-stimulated accumulation of 
phytoalexins may arise through the release from preformed stores 
rather than de novo synthesis. 
Phytoalexins are low mo1 wt antimicrobial secondary me- 
tabolites that accumulate in plant tissues in response to 
infection by microorganisms (Bailey and Mansfield, 1982). 
The production of phytoalexins by plants and cell cultures 
can also be stimulated by exposure to microbial or endoge- 
nous elicitors, or abiotic elicitors such as UV light, the salts 
of heavy metals, detergents, organic solvents, metabolic in- 
hibitors, and plant hormones (Deverall, 1976; VanEtten and 
Pueppke, 1976; Bailey, 1982). 
Abiotic elicitation has been used to obtain sufficient phy- 
toalexin for detailed analysis, to stimulate biosynthesis for 
the investigation of metabolic pathways, and to aid in the 
dissection of complex plant-microbial interactions (Sherwood 
et al., 1970; Dewick and Martin, 1979a, 1979b; Maxwell and 
Phillips, 1990). Thus, the biosynthetic pathways of the iso- 
flavan and pterocarpan phytoalexins in alfalfa (Medicago 
satiua L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) were deter- 
mined by feeding radiolabeled intermediates to copper- 
treated plants (reviewed by Stoessl, 1982). As elicitors, heavy

metal salts are readily available, cheap, easy to use, and more 
chemically defined than biotic agents. I t  has been proposed 
that treatment of plant cell cultures with heavy metals may 
be the ideal method of elicitation for the commercial produc- 
tion of phytoalexins such as gossypol (Threlfall and White- 
head, 1988). However, in terms of its relevance to plant 
pathology, abiotic elicitation has serious limitations, because 
the underlying mechanisms are likely to be very different 
from those of biotic elicitation (Dixon and Lamb, 1990). 
When alfalfa plants are infected or treated with biotic or 
abiotic elicitors they accumulate the pterocarpan phytoalexin 
medicarpin (Bailey and Mansfield, 1982). During biotic elici- 
tation the de novo rates of medicarpin biosynthesis in both 
alfalfa and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) are increased and, in 
addition, both medicarpin and its precursor formononetin 
may be released from preformed glycosidic conjugates (Kess- 
mann et al., 1990; Mackenbrock and Barz, 1991; Macken- 
brock et al., 1993). Roots and cell cultures of alfalfa contain 
appreciable quantities of the conjugates MGM and FGM 
(Tiller et al., 1994). The reasons for the accumulation of 
medicarpin in response to abiotic elicitation are not known, 
but could involve increased rates of biosynthesis and hydrol- 
ysis and/or decreased rates of degradation. As part of an 
integrated program aimed at further understanding the me- 
tabolism and importance of phytoalexins in alfalfa, seedlings 
were abiotically elicited and the metabolism of medicarpin, 
formononetin, and their glycosides was investigated. Our 
evidence suggests that the rate of de novo synthesis of the 
isoflavonoids may be reduced in metal-elicited plants and 
that the majority of the phytoalexins originate from the 
hydrolysis of stored conjugates. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Plant Material 
Seedlings of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv Euver) were 
grown for up to 14 d in vermiculite at 23OC under a 14-h 
photoperiod at a light intensity of 165 PE m-* s-', as described 
by Tiller et al. (1994). Application of metal solutions was as 
a root drench to the seedlings in vermiculite, to cut hypocotyls 
via the transpiration stream, or hydroponically to intact seed- 
lings. For the time-course, dose-dependence, and inhibitor- 
feeding experiments approximately 10 seedlings had their 
roots washed to remove vermiculite and were transferred to

20-mL glass vials containing the solution to be fed. AOPP 
(Cambridge Research Biochemicals Ltd., Northwich, Chesh- 
ire, UK) was used at 0.3 mM, and seedlings to be elicited were 
pretreated with AOPP for 8 h and then fed 1 m CuC12 in 
addition to AOPP. 
Analysis of Plant Material 
At harvest, plants were carefully washed and separated 
into foliage and root tissue. After being blotted dry, the 
material was frozen in liquid NZ and stored at -8OOC pending 
analysis. The solutions from the hydroponic experiments 
were filtered and stored at -2OOC. Weighed plant tissue 
(approximately 1 g) was extracted and analyzed for isofla- 
vonoids by HPLC and TLC as described by Edwards and 
Kessmann (1992). The hydroponic solutions were adjusted to 
pH 2.0 and partitioned twice against an equal volume of 
ethyl acetate. After being reduced to dryness in vacuo (3OoC), 
the extracts were redissolved in methanol and analyzed by 
HPLC. The identity of conjugates was confirmed by hydrol- 
ysis (Tiller et al., 1994). 
Stability of lsoflavonoids in Hydroponic Solutions 
Free and conjugated isoflavonoids were incubated in dis- 
tilled water or filtered solutions in which alfalfa seedling 
roots had been immersed for up to 72 h prior to the start of 
the experiment. Formononetin (Apin Chemicals, Oxford, UK) 
was dissolved in a small volume of 0.5 N NaOH, the pH was 
brought down to 7.0 by the addition of 0.1 M KHzPO, buffer, 
and the mixture was diluted 20-fold with water (Dewick and 
Martin, 1979a). FGM and MGM were purified from alfalfa 
roots, redissolved in methanol, and added to the solutions so 
that the final methanol content was 4% (v/v). 
OGT Purification and Assay 
Isoflavonoid OGT was extracted from alfalfa seedlings and 
its activity was assayed as described by Pany and Edwards 
(1994). 
was in the order zinc > manganese > copper and was dose 
dependent for zinc and manganese. Higher concentrations of 
copper (500-1000 KM) were supraoptimal. Trace$, of formo- 
nonetin (0.3-3.3 nmol g-' fresh weight) were present in 
leaves and roots of seedlings fed with 2500 PM metal solution. 
A 2-h treatment with metal solution, followed by 70 h of 
incubation in water, led to similar increases in rnedicarpin, 
maximally 2.8- and 3.1-fold in leaves and roots clf seedlings 
fed with 1 m copper (data not shown). The feeding of 
higher metal concentrations (25 m) resulted in obvious 
toxicity (leaf chlorosis, loss of turgor in leaves and roots) and 
no greater increases in phytoalexin accumulation. 
The mlost dramatic effects observed in response to the 
metal treatments were changes in the levels of the conjugates 
FGM and MGM in roots (Fig. 1). The higher concentrations 
of CuCI2, fed for 2 or 72 h, led to dose-dependent reductions 
of >98% for FGM and >97% for MGM. MnClz-fed seedling 
roots contained normal levels of MGM but reduced FGM (up 
to 63%), whereas feeding ZnClz led to decreases i n  FGM (up 
to 93%) and MGM (up to 70%). In all cases the ratio of 
FGM:MC;M was reduced, from a maximum of 3.5:l in the 
controls to 1:l in the roots of seedlings fed with higher metal 
concentrations. The low levels of conjugates present in the 
leaves were unaffected by any of the treatments (data not 
shown). Atomic absorption spectrophotometry refealed that 
the amounts of each metal in the foliage and roots were 
similar and, on average, equivalent to half the concentration 
of the feeding solution in the 2-h experiment or equal to the 
concentration fed in the 72-h experiment. The proportion of 
the metals that were biologically available is unknown. 
As determined by HPLC (Aze7), the effect of metal treat- 
ment on the root isoflavonoid content was a massive reduc- 
tion in the levels of conjugated isoflavonoids arid a much 
smaller increase in aglycone concentrations (Fig. Z!). In addi- 
tion to the increases in medicarpin and formononetin, an 
unknown compound (retention time = 14 min), which was 
visible when monitoring at 345 nm and was unaffected by 
RESULTS 
Free and Conjugated lsoflavonoids in Seedlings Treated 
with Metal Solutions 
Seedlings of alfalfa were treated with 1 m copper (11) 
chloride, a procedure commonly used to elicit phytoalexin 
production in legumes, including alfalfa (Dewick and Martin, 
1979a; Maxwell and Phillips, 1990). Levels of medicarpin 
were elevated by at most 6-fold in the leaves and 4-fold in 
the roots, irrespective of the treatment method employed 
(data not shown). 
In a more detailed study, a range of concentrations of 
copper (11) chloride, manganese (11) chloride, and zinc (11) 
chloride were fed hydroponically to alfalfa seedlings, and the 
concentrations of isoflavonoids was determined (Table I; Fig. 
1). Seedlings fed with the metal salts continuously for 72 h 
again showed modest (6- to 7-fold) increases in medicarpin, 
with higher levels in leaves than in roots. The degree of 
medicarpin accumulation in response to the.different metals

controls. Medicarpin, MGM, formononetin, and FGM have 
all been isolated from soil in which alfalfa has been grown 
and from root exudates (Dakora et al., 1993; Leon-Banios et 
al., 1993). To test this possibility, hydroponic solutions that 
had contained alfalfa seedlings fed with either CuC12 or water 
for 72 h were analyzed for the presence of isoflavonoids. No 
traces of isoflavonoids were present in the control (water) 
solution, whereas the solution from the CuC12-fed seedlings 
contained both medicarpin and formononetin, but no FGM 
or MGM. The amounts of formononetin and medicarpin 
isolated were equivalent to approximately 10 to 15 nmol g-' 
fresh weight, thus accounting for less than 10% of the 
'missing" isoflavonoids. 
To examine whether the isoflavonoids were being de- 
graded in the feeding solutions, authentic formononetin and 
purified FGM and MGM were incubated for 24 to 72 h in 
filtered solutions that had contained seedlings fed with either 
water or CuC12 for 72 h. In all cases, recoveries for formo- 
nonetin were high (93% from water; 92% from CuC12; 89% 
from boiled solutions), but the conjugates were much less 
stable (Fig. 3). The disappearance of the conjugates was due 
entirely to hydrolysis, since they were accompanied by equiv- 
alent increases in the levels of the aglycones. The rates of 
hydrolysis for both FGM and MGM were 3- to 4-fold greater 
in the solutions that had contained the CuC12-fed seedlings, 
with MGM being less stable than FGM in both solutions. 
Hydrolysis was not observed in boiled solutions or freshly 
prepared solutions of CuC12. 
Effects of Immersion and Metal Treatment on the 
Distribution and Degradation of lsoflavonoids 
Over the course of the investigation it was observed that 
conjugate levels in roots that had been immersed in water 
for 72 h were 3- to 4-fold higher than in roots of seedlings 
of the same age that had been kept in vermiculite. Therefore, 
a time-course experiment was carried out to determine the 
effect on root isoflavonoid content of immersion in 1 m 
CuC12 or water with and without aeration (Fig. 4). The levels 
of FGM and MGM in roots of seedlings kept in vermiculite 
increased by only 2.6- and 1.2-fold, respectively, over the

previous observations of a developmentally dependent in- 
crease in conjugate levels in alfalfa roots (Tiller et al., 1994). 
In seedlings transferred from vermiculite and whose roots 
were immersed in water, the increases were much higher, 
5.3- and 3.3-fold. Aeration of the water reduced those in- 
creases to 3.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively. As determined 
previously, FGM and MGM levels fell in the CuC12-treated 
seedling roots, but from relatively low initial levels, i.e. from 
15.4 to 4.5 and from 8.4 to 2.7 nmol g-' fresh weight, 
respectively, a combined decrease of less than 17 nmol g-'

lsoflavonoid Metabolism in Alfalfa 199 
in the solution, and between 48 and 72 h the overall isofla- 
vonoid content was reduced by 15% from the levels at O h. 
The effect of CuC1, and root immersion on isoflavonoid 
metabolism was further investigated through the use of 
AOPP, a potent and specific inhibitor of Phe ammonia-lyase, 
the first enzyme on the biosynthetic pathway leading to the 
isoflavonoids (Amrhein and Godeke, 1977). By inhibiting 
isoflavonoid synthesis, it was possible to determine whether 
CuC12 and immersion/anaerobiosis were affecting the levels 
of aglycones and conjugates primarily by influencing biosyn- 
thesis or degradation (Barz and Koster, 1981). 
Alfalfa seedlings were treated hydroponically with water, 
AOPP, or AOPP and CuC1,. The resultant isoflavonoid levels 
and distribution are shown in Figure 6. The effectiveness of 
the AOPP can be seen by comparing isoflavonoid levels in 
seedlings immersed in water or AOPP for 72 h. AOPP 
treatment revealed that the rates of degradation for both 
FGM and MGM in roots were progressively reduced with 
increased time of immersion in water. The rate of FGM 
degradation was 1.6 nmol g-' fresh weight h-' between O 
and 8 h, which fell to 1.1 nmol g-' h-' between 8 and 24 h, 
and fell again to only 0.1 nmol g-' h-' between 24 and 72 h. 
The MGM pool was reduced at a lower rate, 0.5 nmol g-' 
fresh weight h-' between O and 8 h, which fell to close to 
zero after 8 h. However, MGM levels increased between 24 
and 72 h, presumably as a result of formononetin, released 
from FGM, being converted to medicarpin and then conju- 
gated. Therefore, it was considered more appropriate for our 
purposes to measure overall rates of conjugate degradation. 
These decreased from 2.16 nmol g-' fresh weight h-' between 
O and 8 h to 0.96 nmol g-' h-' (8-24 h) down to only 0.02 
nmol g-' h-' (24-72 h).

were 26.4 nmol g-' fresh weight higher than those in roots 
of the same age kept in vermiculite, and by 72 h were 59.0 
nmol g-' fresh weight higher (Fig. 4). These differences 
amount to an average of 1.1 to 1.2 nmol g-' fresh weight h-' 
extra FGM and MGM accumulating in the immersed roots. 
Because conjugate degradation was inhibited as a result of 
immersion by between 1.2 and 2.1 nmol g-' fresh weight h-' 
over the same period, it seems likely that inhibition of con- 
jugate degradation alone could fully account for the accu- 
mulation observed in submerged roots. 
In contrast, the rates of conjugate degradation in the 
AOPP-treated roots exposed to CuCl, were 74 to 78% higher 
than in those roots treated with AOPP only. Between O and 
24 h, 55% of this increased conjugate degradation could be 
ascribed to increased rates of hydrolysis and exudation. A 
comparison of the isoflavonoid content of roots treated with 
CuC12 in the absence of AOPP revealed that after 24 h the 
levels of the aglycones in the roots and solution were only 
10% higher than in those roots where isoflavonoid biosyn- 
thesis had been inhibited with AOPP (24.1 compared to 22.3 
nmol g-' fresh weight). This suggested that more than 90% 
of the formononetin and medicarpin observed in CuC1,- 
treated seedlings resulted from conjugate hydrolysis and not 
de novo biosynthesis. After correcting for the differing con- 
jugate degradation rates, it was calculated that after 24 h of 
CuC12 treatment the amount of isoflavonoids synthesized de 
novo was virtually identical to that in control seedlings (24.8 
and 23.1 nmol g-' fresh weight, respectively). However, by 
72 h the CuClz-treated seedlings had made only 20 to 25% 
as much isoflavonoid as those fed with water. This suggested 
that, although CuClz may cause a transient increase in the 
rate of isoflavonoid synthesis, this is quickly negated by toxic 
effects that reduce the metabolic capacity of the plant. 
To determine whether the metal-mediated decrease in 
conjugate levels resulted, in part, from decreased synthesis, 
the effects of various metal salts on isoflavonoid OGT activity 
purified from alfalfa seedlings were examined (Table 11).

DISCUSSION 
The effects of heavy metals and immersion/anaerobiosis 
on isoflavonoid metabolism in alfalfa roots are summarized 
in Figure 7. The isoflavonoid content of the alfalfa roots at 
any one time will be determined by the rates of biosynthesis 
(stimulated by cell wall fragments released from dead/injured 
cells; inhibited as a primary or secondary consequence of 
metal toxicity) and degradation (stimulated by metals or a 
consequence of toxicity; inhibited by anaerobiosis). The type 
of metal and the dose (concentration/time of feeding) and 
degree of anaerobiosis will therefore interact. The order of 
toxicity for the metals used in this series of experiments, in 
terms of their effect on isoflavonoid metabolism, was copper 
> zinc > manganese. 
Although CuC12 has often been used as an elicitor for 
alfalfa plants, there is very little quantitative data available 
on the resultant increases in phytoalexin concentrations. The 
results of our experiments suggest that any increases are 
likely to be modest. Dewick and Martin (1979b) reported that 
the biosynthesis of medicarpin, vestitol, sativan, and 9-0- 
methylcoumestrol was "greatly stimulated" in 4-d-old alfalfa 
seedlings placed in 1 m CuC& for 8 h followed by 16 h in 
water, but they later quoted increases of only 3-fold for 9-0- 
methylcoumestrol. In the majority of cases phytoalexin con- 
tent has been qualitatively examined by paper chromatogra- 
phy or TLC. In the present study, extracts were fractionated 
by HPLC and concentrations were calculated from appropri- 
ate calibration curves. Medicarpin increased by a maximum 
of 6- to 7-fold in response to metal treatment, compared to 
increases of several hundred-fold in alfalfa cell cultures 
treated with a fungal cell wall preparation (Tiller et al., 1994). 
Formononetin occurred at lower levels than medicarpin and 
only in roots treated with the highest metal concentrations. 
An unknown aglycone accumulated to levels similar to those 
of medicarpin in both leaves and roots, but the levels of 
coumestrol and 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone remained unchanged.

ment on isoflavonoid metabolism in the roots of alfalfa seedlings. 
Dotted lines represent the known or suggested sites of enzyme 
inhibition. X, Pathway(s) of degradation, the nature and subcellular 
location of which are unknown. 
The latter two compounds have been reported to accumulate 
in the foliage of older alfalfa plants in response to a 1 m 
CuC12 treatment (Shenvood et al., 1970). The isoflavans 
vestitol and sativan have also been shown to accumulate in 
response to abiotic elicitation, but we observed sativan only 
in the root exudates of seedlings fed with high concentrations 
of metal (5 m) for long periods of time (72 h). 
As staited above, the isoflavan/pterocarpan biosynthetic 
pathway was elucidated in CuC12-treated alfalfa and clover 
seedlings (Dewick, 1975; Dewick and Martin, 1979a, 1979b; 
Martin aind Dewick, 1980; Stoessl, 1982). Specilic incorpo- 
ration of radioactivity from labeled formononetin into medi- 
carpin was excellent (up to 30%; Dewick and Martin, 1979b), 
but incorporation from other compounds thought to be med- 
icarpin precursors was much lower. Although there are in- 
creases IUI the levels of medicarpin and formononetin in 
CuC12-treated seedlings, the results from the c xperiments 
described above reveal that these derive largely (up to 90%) 
from elevated rates of conjugate hydrolysis. As compared 
with seeidlings from time O, those treated with CuC12 do 
contain higher overall isoflavonoid levels (60-70% higher; 
8-48 h), but the levels in seedlings kept in veimiculite or 
those whose roots were immersed in water are higher still 
(171 and 189% higher, respectively). When differences in 
rates of degradation (see below) are taken into account, the 
amounts of isoflavonoids synthesized by seedlings treated 
with water or CuC12 appear to be very similar after 24 h, but 
by 72 h the CuCl,-fed seedlings have made 75 ío 80% less 
than those fed only water. This observation has been con- 
firmed by recent studies in our laboratory that revealed that 
after 24 h the incorporation of label from [**C]Phe into 
medicarpin was similar in alfalfa hypocotyls pretreated (24 
h) with water or 500 PM CuC12 (A.C.E. Gregory, unpublished 
data). 
The effects of metals on plant metabolism are complex and 
involve the inhibition of many enzymes, notably those as- 
sociated with photosynthesis, the disruption of riembranes, 
and the induction of 'stress" responses such as the stimulation 
of peroxidase activity (Foy et al., 1978; Van tissche and 
Clijsters, 1990). There could be several explanations for the 
inhibition of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in metal-treated seed- 
lings. The first is the direct inhibition of an isoflavonoid 
biosynthetic enzyme. Some of these enzymes have been 
shown not to be inhibited by divalent metal ion:;, e.g. chal- 
cone isomerase and pterocarpan synthase, but isoflavone 
synthase was strongly inhibited by 20 m~ copper and 20 m 
zinc (Stafford, 1990). 
Second, an inhibition of the isoflavonoid-conjugating en- 
zymes, combined with a stimulation of conjugate hydrolysis, 
could suppress de novo synthesis through a feedback mech- 
anism. There is an apparent correlation between the inhibi- 
tion of OGT activity and conjugate accumulation in CuC12- 
treated seedling roots. The relationship is less clear after 
treatment with ZnClz or MnC12, although in both cases inhi- 
bition of OGT activity and conjugate accumulahon are less 
severe than after CuC12 treatment. The inhibition of isofla- 
vonoid OGT activity by divalent metal ions is nst unusual; 
several phenolic/flavonoid OGTs are inhibited in this manner 
(Heller and Forkmann, 1988; Ibrahim and Variri, 1993). In 
addition, a malonyltransferase capable of acylating cyanidin-

lsoflavonoid Metabolism in Alfalfa 201 
3-glucoside from flower buds of Dendranthema morifolium 
was found to be inhibited by a range of divalent metal ions, 
including copper and zinc (Ino et al., 1993), suggesting that 
both malonylation and glycosylation are sensitive to inhibi- 
tion by metal ions. The inhibition of conjugation is therefore 
likely to be one, but not the sole, reason for the metal- 
mediated effect on isoflavonoid metabolism. Altematively, a 
disruption in primary metabolism may affect the supply of 
cofactors and substrates necessary for isoflavonoid synthesis. 
The changes in alfalfa isoflavonoid levels observed in 
response to metal treatment and immersion/anaerobiosis 
were not caused by altered biosynthesis alone, but through 
changes to rates of both synthesis and degradation. Similarly, 
Yoshikawa (1978) reported that the levels of glyceollin in 
elicited soybean (Glycine max L.) were dependent on the 
relative rates of induced biosynthesis and constitutive de- 
grading activity. Interestingly, copper sulfate inhibited both 
degradation (by 83%) and synthesis (by 65%) of glyceollin 
by soybean (Yoshikawa, 1978). 
Considerable progress has been made toward understand- 
ing the pathways and regulation of isoflavonoid synthesis in 
legumes, but far less is known about their degradation and 
tumover (Dixon and Lamb, 1990; Barz and Welle, 1992). 
Tumover may consist of many different reaction types, in- 
cluding interconversion reactions to related compounds (e.g. 
formononetin to medicarpin), conjugation, polymerization, 
and breakdown to simple precursors of primary metabolism 
(Barz and Koster, 1981; Barz et al., 1985; Barz and Welle, 
1992). From the results of our experiments it is possible 
to divide conjugate metabolism only into reactions that 
lead to the accumulation of aglycones and those that do 
not, i.e. those that involve isoflavonoid breakdown and/or 
polymerization. 
Conjugate tumover rates were estimated from the rates of 
disappearance of FGM and MGM in AOPP-treated seedlings 
and were found to be similar to published values for similar 
compounds (Barz and Welle, 1992). Isoflavonoid conjugate 
degradation rates in seedlings whose roots were immersed in 
water for 24 h declined by over 100-fold, leading to the 
accumulation of FGM and MGM. Aeration of the water 
reduced this accumulation. Under normal circumstances 
tumover is not accompanied by increases in the aglycone 
levels, and so must involve the operation of an as-yet- 
uncharacterized degradation pathway. Preliminary results 
suggest that root isoflavonoid OGT activity is also induced 
2- to 3-fold as a consequence of immersion (A.D. Parry, 
unpublished data). 
As a crop, alfalfa can withstand wet or waterlogged soils 
for a period of time (3-14 d) depending on the soil temper- 
ature, but with a diminished final yield (Sheaffer et al., 1988). 
Inadequate root oxygen supplies lead to the accumulation of 
ethanol and lactic acid, which are thought to be detrimental 
to the selectivity of the root cell membranes (Jackson and 
Drew, 1984). The effects on isoflavonoid conjugate levels of 
flooding in the field are not known, but may be of interest 
in view of the role of these compounds in defense and 
nodulation. 
Treatment with CuCI2 increased conjugate tumover rates, 
partly due to an increase in the rate of hydrolysis and partly 
due to an increase in the rates of altemative degradation. An 
important route for isoflavonoid metabolism was via exuda- 
tion from the root. Conjugate stability experiments suggested 
that this was associated with increased levels of a hydrolytic 
activity, presumably a 0-glucosidase, in the CuCL-containing 
feeding solutions. Increases in 0-glucosidase activity in elic- 
ited plant tissues and cultures have been observed previously, 
and it has been shown that isoflavonoid conjugates can serve 
as preformed stores of both phytoalexins and their precursors, 
being hydrolyzed in response to biotic elicitation (Graham et 
al., 1990; Kessmann et al., 1990; Mackenbrock and Barz, 
1991; Mackenbrock et al., 1993). The proportions of FGM 
and MGM that are exported as such and hydrolyzed in the 
root exudate, compared to being hydrolyzed in the root, is 
not known. Graham (1991) found that high levels of the 
malonylated conjugate of daidzein were released from de- 
veloping soybean roots but were rapidly hydrolyzed to free 
daidzein in the root exudate. 
The major site of the altemative degradation pathway is 
presumably within the root, because the aglycones were quite 
stable in the filtered hydroponic solutions. However, since 
the aglycone levels decrease in the CuCI2-feeding solution 
after 48 h, when the roots are still present, there must exist 
mechanisms for formononetin and medicarpin uptake and 
metabolism. Altematively, metabolism may occur in the root 
exudate but be catalyzed by an unstable enzyme. Isoflavo- 
noid degradation may involve peroxidase activity, because 
copper and other metals are known to induce these enzymes 
(Van Assche and Clijsters, 1990), and a peroxidase-mediated 
polymerization has been proposed to remove medicarpin and 
maackiain from the growth medium of chickpea cell cultures 
and from the extracellular spaces of plant tissues (Barz et al., 
1990). 
Our results further confirm the central role of conjugation 
in isoflavonoid metabolism and suggest that the use of metals 
as abiotic elicitors may have even greater limitations than 
anticipated. Caution should also be exercised in interpreting 
the results of feeding experiments such as the hydroponic 
ones described above, because more than one factor could be 
influencing isoflavonoid metabolism.
