St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) permitiu o isolamento de duas substâncias inéditas: 4-metoxi-6-[2-(metilamino)fenil]-2H-piran-2-ona e acetato de rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hidroxi-3-metil-1-butenil]-4,8-dimetoxi-5,6,7,8-tetraidrofuro[2,3-b]quinolin-7-ila; e dos alcalóides arborinina, N-metil-1-hidroxi-3-metoxiacridona,esquimianina, cocusagina, isodutaduprina, isoesquimianina e isococusagina. Através da análise dosdados espectroscópicos foram estabelecidas as estruturas químicas das substâncias isoladas sendoque para os alcalóides inéditos tais dados são descritos pela primeira vez. Além disso, os ensaiosbilógicos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do Trypanosoma cruzi das substâncias isoladas mostraramque elas possuem atividade tripanocida moderada.The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract from leaves of Almeidea rubraA. St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one and rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, N-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimmianine, kokusagine, isodutaduprine, isoskimmianine, andisokokusagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the newcompounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on thetripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi showing moderate trypanocidal activity.Keywords: Almeidea rubra, Rutaceae, alkaloids, trypanocidal activityIntroductionThe genus Almeidea belongs to Rutaceae family andis widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondarymetabolites of this genus are available. From Almeideaguyanensis was isolated C-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4-quinolones, and flavone C-glycosides.1 We havepreviously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone,2-quinolone, and furoquinoline alkaloids, and a newtetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid from A. coeruela and A.rubra2 besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone,and one flavone.3Chagas’ disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is causedby the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affectingmore than 18 million people in Latin America.4 Its treatmentis still a challenge and new less toxic and more effectivedrugs are necessary.As a part of our search for new trypanocidal compoundsand our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a newspecimen of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. was investigated.Thus, here we report the isolation, identification andcharacterization of two new substances (1 and 2a) and sevenknown compounds (3-9) from methanol extract of leaves ofthis plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities.Results and DiscussionThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of435New Pyrone and Quinoline Alkaloid from Almeidea rubra and their Trypanocidal ActivityVol. 16, No. 3A, 2005methanol extract from leaves of A. rubra afforded two newcompounds (1 and 2a) and known compounds (Figure 1)arborinine (3), N-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone(4),5 skimmianine (5),6 kokusagine (6),7 isodutaduprine(7),8 isoskimmianine (8), and isokokusagine (9), whichwere identified through comparison of their NMR spectraldata with the literature.Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow powder and itsstructure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS.The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed aromatic protons atδ 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4’, H-6’, andH-3’, H5’, respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5)appeared at δ 5.49, and 6.23 (d, J 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2-pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described byPizzolatti et al.,9 besides broad N-H and N-CH3 signals at δ5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at δ 3.85 (3H) revealedthe presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule.The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 13 carbons,distinguished as 5 quaternaries (δ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8,147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (δ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2),2 ofelinics (δ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (δ 55.9), and 1 N-methyl carbon (δ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR andHSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly allchemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/hydrogens of 1 (Table 1).The assignments of quaternary carbons were possiblefrom observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. Thechemical shift of C-2’ was deduced from 3J correlationbetween N-CH3 hydrogens (δ 2.87) and one carbon at δ147.6. C-4 (δ 171.7) was assigned through 3J correlationbetween the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens(δ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (δ 162.8) and C-1’ (δ 116.0)were determined through 2J-3J correlation to H-5 (δ 6.23).Finally, through the 2J correlation between H-3 (δ 5.49)and a carbonyl carbon at δ 164.0 was attributed C-2.All these results allowed us to propose the structure 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one forcompound 1, which is described for the first time in theliterature and represents a new class of compounds formedby the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl-CoA units.Single crystal X-ray diffraction establishedundoubtedly the structure of 1 as a derivative of anthranilicacid (Figure 2). The crystal structure of compound 1 shows the presenceof two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure2). The main conformational difference between bothindependent molecules is centered in the dihedral anglebetween the least square planes that pass through thearomatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle inmolecule 1 is 33.58(8)° and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)°.The crystal structure also shows the presence of oneintramolecular interaction in each molecule. Theseinteractions are slightly different due to the conformationFigure 1. Compounds isolated from Almeidea rubra.Table 1.

The analyses of the crystal packing show thepresence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C-H…O that give rise to the formation of chains along the(101) direction. These chains are connected with the chainjust above and below it through three intermolecularinteractions of the N-H…O type.The quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widelydistributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination ofanthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, theciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogenatom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound 1 shouldbe formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atomto the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an α-pyrone.We have previously reported the isolation of the newtetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid 2b (Figure 1) from A.coerulea.2 Reinvestigation of A. rubra afforded an alkaloid2a whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of2b. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder andidentified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formulaC20H25NO6 of 2a was defined by elemental analysis.In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2a were observed a pair ofdoublets (J 2.6 Hz) at δ 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at δ4.30, which indicate that 2a was a tetrahydrofuroquinolinealkaloid. The signals at δ 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned toH-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that 2a had a reducedfuroquinoline ring.1H NMR spectrum of 2a also showed two singlets at δ3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at δ 6.06 (d, J 16.1Hz), 5.69 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), whichindicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenylsubstituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it wasestablished that 2a distinguished from 2b by the presenceof 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead ofγ,γ-dimethylallyl moiety.Analysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts tomethyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of 2a(Table 2).The assignments of quaternary carbons of 2a were madefrom observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. Thechemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3J correlationbetween methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (δ 4.30) and onecarbon at δ 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxylhydrogens (δ 3.14) and one carbon at δ 79.7 determinedFigure 2. ORTEP-3 diagram of compound 1.Table 2.

C-4a was assigned through correlation between thecarbon at δ 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (δ 2.78, and 2.01). H-5also correlated to C-8a (δ 150.0). Furthermore, methylhydrogens at δ 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with anoxygenated carbon at δ 70.8, establishing C-3”. Finally,the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (δ 7.58, and6.97) and quaternary carbons at δ 162.7, and 105.2determined C-2, and C-3, respectively.The close similarity between the chemical shiftsobserved for carbons of reduced furoquinoline ring whencompared with the model compound 7-O-acetylha-plophyllidine (2b)2 led us to suggest a trans relationshipbetween the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid2a, rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature,and the occurrence of tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloidsuch as 2a and 2b seems to be restricted to the generaAlmeidea and Haplophyllum of Rutaceae family.2,11In order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, wehave been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae,Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cneoraceae)aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in thedevelopment of new antichagasic drugs.Compounds described in this paper were isolated froman active fraction of A. rubra (62.9% lysis – percentreduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigoteforms of T. cruzi.12 Their in vitro trypanocidal actions areshown on Table 3. Three of them (7-9) could not be assayeddue to their instability.The results showed that all of compounds had moderatetrypanocidal actions and kokusagine (6) was the mostactive one. Probably, they are responsible by the activityof the A. rubra fraction.12 However, they could not beconsidered good prototype for the development of newantichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities arecompared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolatedfrom other Rutaceae.13ExperimentalGeneral experimental proceduresThe 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra wereobtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX-400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane(TMS) as internal standard.Low resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A,GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu.Plant materialThe leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. were collectedin May 2000 in Espírito Santo State, southeast of Brazil.The plant material was identified by Dr. José Rubens Piranifrom the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo(Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani et al.4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department.Extraction and isolationDried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexaneand then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanolextract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient,to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD,ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) wassubmitted to column chromatography over silica (silicagel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with ahexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions.The second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) waschromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh,358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasingpolarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2→MeOH) to afford tenfractions.

The infected blood was diluted with healthy miceblood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL.Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolvingin dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substanceswere evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 µg/mL.The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titrationmicroplates (96 wells) which contained 400 µL mixture/well. The plates were incubated at 4 oC, and the number ofparasites counted after 24 h, following the methoddescribed by Brener.20Infected blood with the same volume of DMSO wasused as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of250 µg/mL was used as positive control.The activity is expressed as percent reduction of theparasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculatedusing the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to FAPESP and CNPq for the439New Pyrone and Quinoline Alkaloid from Almeidea rubra and their Trypanocidal ActivityVol. 16, No. 3A, 2005financial support and to Dr José Rubens Pirani forcollecting and identifying the Almeidea rubra specimen.References1.
