Direct hyphenation of analytical-scale high-performance liquid chromatography, photo-diode array
detection, mass spectrometry, solid-phase extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR) has been used for accelerated dereplication of crude extract of Haplophyllum
acutifolium (syn. Haplophyllum perforatum). This technique allowed fast on-line identiﬁcation of six quin-
olinone alkaloids, named haplacutine A–F, as well as of acutine, haplamine, eudesmine, and 2-nonylquin-
olin-4(1H)-one. Acutine and haplacutine E, isolated by preparative-scale HPLC, showed moderate
antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values of 2.17 ± 0.22 lM and 3.79 ± 0.24 lM, respectively (chloro-
quine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain).

1. Introduction
Selecting the strategy for isolation of constituents from plant
extracts and other natural sources is of utmost importance with re-
spect to the outcome as well as time and efforts spent on discovery
of pharmacologically active natural products. Prior to preparative-
scale isolation, it is convenient to gain as much knowledge as pos-
sible about chemical entities present, both in order to make qual-
iﬁed decisions about worthwhileness of isolation of a particular
constituent, and to choose optimal isolation methodology.
Although some information about extract constituents can be ob-
tained from thin layer chromatography combined with the use of
compound class-speciﬁc spray reagents, by gas chromatography
combined with mass spectrometry (MS), and by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with photo-diode array
detection (PDA) or MS, all these techniques suffer from the limited
structural information they provide as compared to nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques.
Within recent years, hyphenation of HPLC, PDA, MS, and solid-
phase extraction (SPE), with NMR spectroscopy (HPLC–PDA–MS–
SPE–NMR) has emerged as an attractive analytical technique for
fast and reliable dereplication of crude plant extracts (Jaroszewski,
2005a,b; Staerk et al., 2006; Sturm and Seger, 2007). This technique
has been used for identiﬁcation of known compounds as well as for
rigorous structure elucidation of new natural products directly
from crude extracts. Examples include sesquiterpene lactones
(Lambert et al., 2007), quinic acid derivatives (Sprogøe et al.,
2007), diterpenes and caffeoyl glycosides (Clarkson et al., 2006a,
2006b), ﬂavonoid glycosides (Clarkson et al., 2005; Exarchou
et al., 2006; Tatsis et al., 2007), cardenolide glycosides (Clarkson
et al., 2005), isoﬂavonoids (Lambert et al., 2005a), and alkaloids
(Bieri et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Sturm et al., 2007). One advan-
tage of the HPLC–SPE–NMR technique compared to direct HPLC–
NMR methods (Albert, 2002; Jaroszewski, 2005a) is the possibility
of linear analyte accumulation by repetitive adsorption on SPE car-
tridges (Clarkson et al., 2006a; Lambert et al., 2005a, b). Subsequent
elution of the analytewith a deuterated organic solvent, resulting in
focusing of the analyte in the detection cell, adds further increase in
sensitivity of this hyphenated NMR technique (Jaroszewski, 2005b;
Staerk et al., 2006). Here, we describe application of HPLC–PDA–
MS–SPE–NMR to fast dereplication of an extract of aerial parts of
Haplophyllum acutifolium, which showed activity (IC50 < 12 lg/ml)
in our in vitro Plasmodium falciparum toxicity screening assay.

from the Mediterranean parts of Europe and Africa to Eastern parts
of Siberia. Around 30 of these species are represented in Iran, 14 of
which are endemic to the country. Haplophyllum is known as a rich
source of quinoline alkaloids, and several phytochemical investiga-
tions of different species have been reported in recent years (Mi-
chael, 2008), including investigations of H. acutifolium collected
in Turkmenistan (Razzakova et al., 1975, 1986, and references cited
therein). Extracts of various Haplophyllum species are used in tradi-
tional medicine as analgesics, antispasmodics, diuretics, and seda-
tives, as well as topical agents against skin diseases (Nazrullaev
et al., 2001). Quinolinone alkaloids isolated from Haplophyllum
and other Rutaceous species have shown estrogenic (Nazrullaev
et al., 2001), antifungal (Cantrell et al., 2005), antialgal
(Cheng et al., 2005), antiviral (Cheng et al., 2005), antibacterial
(Hanawa et al., 2004), and antiparasitic activity (Michael, 2003). In
spite of the existence of an abundant literature about quinolinone
alkaloids ofHaplophyllum, dereplication of the extract ofH. acutifoli-
um using HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR allowed fast identiﬁcation of
several previously unknownminor alkaloids present in the plant.
2. Results and discussion
HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR experiments with crude ethyl ace-
tate extract of aerial parts of H. acutifolium (crude extract A, see
Section 4) were performed using UV trace at 235 nm for thresh-
old-based adsorption of constituents on SPE cartridges containing
poly(divinylbenzene)-based resin (Clarkson et al., 2007). Four or
six repetitive trappings of material eluted in peaks 1–9 (Fig. 1)
were performed. The trapped compounds were subsequently
eluted with CD3CN for acquisition of NMR data. This led to identi-
ﬁcation of ﬁve new and two already known 4-quinolinone alka-
loids (1, 2a, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9) along with a tricyclic hemiterpenoid
alkaloid haplamine (5) and the lignan 7 as detailed below; the
identiﬁed structures (Fig. 2) are numbered according to elution
order of the HPLC peaks (Fig. 1). Parallel HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–
NMR experiments with an alkaloid-enriched fraction (fraction III
from crude extract B, see Section 4) showed the existence of one
additional, new quinolinone alkaloid (2b) as a minor constituent.
The constituent eluted as peak 1 (compound 1) was assigned
the molecular formula C18H21NO2 as determined by off-line HRE-
SIFTMS. The 1H NMR spectrum acquired in the HPLC–SPE–NMR
mode showed the presence of a 1,2-disubstituted benzene with a
characteristic downﬁeld shift of H-5 (d 8.11, J5-6 = 8.0 Hz and
J5-7 = 1.4 Hz) attributable to a peri-oriented carbonyl group, a
one-proton singlet of H-3 (d 5.98), and a broad singlet of H-1 (d
9.55). This information, together with 1H–1H correlations for H-5,
H-6, H-7, and H-8 found in a COSY spectrum and 13C NMR reso-
nances identiﬁed in a HSQC spectrum, both acquired in the
HPLC–SPE–NMR mode, proved the presence of a 2-substituted 4-
quinolinone moiety. In the COSY spectrum, a spin system corre-
sponding to a (3Z,5E)-7-hydroxynona-3,5-dien-1-yl moiety was
observed. The conﬁguration of the two conjugated double bonds
was determined by analysis of the coupling patterns of H-30 and
H-40 (H-30: d 5.44, dt, J30-40 = 10.4 Hz, J20-30 = 7.7 Hz; H-40: d 6.03 br
t, J30-40  J40-50  11.1 Hz) and of H-50 and H-60 (H-50: d 6.45, ddt,
J50-60 = 15.2 Hz, J40-50 = 11.2 Hz, J50-70 = J30-50 = 1.2 Hz; H-60: d 5.62, dd,
J50-60 = 15.2 Hz, J60-70 = 6.3 Hz) as Z and E, respectively. The hydroxyl-
ation of C-70 was established by HSQC correlation of the 13C reso-
nance at d 73.7 with H-70 (d 3.90), identiﬁed by its COSY
correlations. Preparative-scale isolation afforded 4 mg of 1, which
showed no optical rotation. Since chiral allylic alcohols and 2,4-
diene-1-ols display appreciable speciﬁc rotation at the sodium D-
line (Airs et al., 1942; Burgess and Jennings, 1991; Takaishi et al.,
1991; Tsai et al., 2001), it is concluded that 1 isolated from H. acu-
tifolium is a racemate. Compound 1 is a new alkaloid for which the
name haplacutine A is suggested.
The material eluted with peak 2 (compound 2a) was assigned
the molecular formula C18H21NO2 as determined by off-line HRE-
SIFTMS. Based on the 1H NMR and COSY spectra acquired in the
HPLC–SPE–NMR mode, it contained a 4-quinolinone moiety and a
spin system corresponding to a 3-hydroxynona-4,6-dien-1-yl moi-
ety. The conﬁguration of the C-40–C-50 double bond was estab-
lished as E (H-40: d 5.70, br dd, J40-50 = 15.2 Hz, J30-40 = 6.4 Hz; H-50:
d 6.53, ddt, J40-50 = 15.2 Hz, J50-60 = 11.1 Hz, J50-70 = J30-50 = 1.2 Hz) and
that of the C-60–C-70 double bond as Z (H-60: d 5.95, m; H-70: d
5.44, dt, J60-70 = 10.8 Hz, J70-80 = 7.5 Hz). When the HPLC–PDA–MS–
SPE–NMR analysis was performed with the corresponding peak
of an alkaloid-enriched fraction of the extract (fraction III obtained
from crude extract B, see Section 4), 2a was accompanied by a clo-
sely related analogue 2b (approximately 60% relative to the major
constituent 2a as determined from the integrals of the 1H NMR
resonances, see Supplementary Fig. 3). The conﬁguration of both
double bonds in the minor constituent was E (H-40: d 5.61, dd,

labeled 1–9 were identiﬁed by HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR experiments.

J40-50 = 15.3 Hz, J30-40 = 6.6 Hz; H-50: d 6.20, dd, J40-50 = 15.3 Hz,
J50-60 = 10.6 Hz; H-60: d 6.05, dd, J60-70 = 15.3 Hz, J50-60 = 10.6 Hz;
H-70; d 5.75, dt, J60-70 = 15.3 Hz, J70-80 = 6.6 Hz). Thus, 2a and 2b are
stereoisomers, and they are both new compounds for which the
names haplacutine B and haplacutine C, respectively, are sug-
gested. In the crude extract A, 2b was undetectable, and therefore
2b co-eluting with 2a in the alkaloid-enriched fraction III may be
an artefact formed by acid-catalyzed, free-radical or photochemi-
cal isomerization of 2a or by an allylic-type rearrangement of 1.
The constituent eluted as peak 3 (compound 3) was assigned
the molecular formula C18H19NO2 (off-line HRESIFTMS). In addition
to signals from a 4-quinolinone moiety, 1H NMR and COSY spectra
showed signals corresponding to an aliphatic A2X2 spin system and
a hexa-1,3-dien-1-yl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of the signals of
H-20 and H-50 (d 3.10 and 7.57, respectively) conﬁrmed that the
two moieties are connected by the C-30 carbonyl group. Analysis
of the coupling pattern of H-40 to H-70 (see Section 4.9) established
the E- and Z-conﬁguration of the C-40–C-50 and C-60–C-70 double
bonds, respectively. Compound 3 is a new alkaloid for which the
name haplacutine D is suggested.
The constituent eluted as peak 4 (compound 4) was assigned
the molecular formula C16H19NO (HRESIFTMS), and the 1H NMR
spectrum showed signals corresponding to a 4-quinolinone moiety
and a hept-4-en-1-yl moiety. The 1H NMR data were in agreement
with those reported for acutine, previously isolated from H. acutifo-
lium (Razzakova et al., 1975). Acutine was initially formulated as 2-
(hept-4-enyl)quinolin-4(1H)-one (Gulyamova et al., 1974) without
any information about the conﬁguration of the double bond, but
the coupling patterns observed for H-40 and H-50 in the present
investigation (H-40: d 5.38, dtt, J40-50 = 10.8 Hz, J30-40 = 7.1 Hz, J40-60 =
1.4 Hz; H-50: d 5.44, dtt, J40-50 = 10.8 Hz, J50-60 = 7.1 Hz, J30-50 =
1.2 Hz) proved that compound 4, and thus acutine, is 2-[(4Z)-
hept-4-en-1-yl]quinolin-4(1H)-one.
Haplamine (5) was identiﬁed as the material eluted with peak 5.
Although the coupling pattern observed for the three hydrogens of
the aromatic ring system indicated the presence of a 1,2,4-trisubsti-
tuted benzene, the site of methoxylation (i.e., C-6 or C-7) could not
be unambiguously assigned by comparison of the observed chemi-
cal shift values with those reported for haplamine (syn. 6-meth-
oxyﬂindersine) (Campbell et al., 1990; Cantrell et al., 2005) and 7-
methoxyﬂindersine (Brader et al., 1996). However, correlations
found in a NOESY spectrum acquired in the HPLC–SPE–NMR mode
(see Supplementary Fig. 1) proved methoxylation at C-6.
The constituent eluted as peak 6 (compound 6) was assigned
the molecular formula C18H21NO (HRESIFTMS). This is in agree-
ment with the presence of a 4-quinolinone moiety and a nona-
3,6-dien-1-yl moiety, as conﬁrmed by connectivities observed in
a COSY spectrum. The Z-conﬁguration of the C-60–C-70 double bond
was identiﬁed based on 1H NMR coupling patterns (H-60: d 5.20,
dtt, J60-70 = 10.7 Hz, J50-60 = 7.3 Hz, J60-80 = 1.6 Hz; H-70: d 5.31, dtt, J60-70 =
10.7 Hz, J70-80 = 7.2 Hz, J50-70 = 1.6 Hz), whereas the conﬁguration
of the C-30–C-40 double bond was not immediately clear because
H-30 and H-40 appeared as a multiplet (d 5.42). However, the sim-
ulated coupling pattern of H-30 and H-40 using J30-40 coupling con-
stant corresponding to the Z-conﬁguration was practically
identical to the experimentally observed coupling pattern (simula-
tion parameters: dY-30 5.43, dY-40 5.41, J30-40 = 10.7 Hz, J40-50 = 7.1 Hz,
J20-30 = 6.8 Hz, J20-40 = J30-50 = 1.1 Hz), whereas simulated spectrum
using an E coupling constant was distinctly different (data not
shown; cf. however structure of 8 and Fig. 4). In addition, the ob-
served chemical shifts of C-20 and C-50 (d 27.2 and d 26.0, respec-
tively, obtained from a HSQC spectrum), were in agreement with
the Z-conﬁguration of the C-30–C-40 double bond, whereas chemi-
cal shift values above d 30 would be expected for the E-conﬁgura-
tion, as shown by chemical shift predictions and literature data
(Ivanciuc et al., 1997). Thus, compound 6 is formulated as 2-
[(3Z,6Z)-nona-3,6-dien-1-yl]quinolin-4(1H)-one. Full assignment
of all 1H and 13C NMR resonances was possible based on 1H, COSY,
HSQC, and HMBC experiments obtained in the HPLC–SPE–NMR
mode. In order to illustrate the use of HPLC–SPE–NMR methodol-
ogy, the HSQC and HMBC spectra used for assignment of 13C reso-
nances of 6 are shown in Fig. 3. A compound with a similar
structure has previously been isolated from Vepris ampody (Kan-
Fan et al., 1970). However, the authors were only able to identify
the compound as either 2-(nona-3,6-dien-1-yl)quinolin-4(1H)-
one or 2-(nona-2,6-dien-1-yl)quinolin-4(1H)-one, and without
any information about conﬁguration of the double bonds. Later,
Razzakova et al. (1986) isolated a constituent named 2-nonadie-

nyl-4-quinoline, but without any information about the position
and conﬁguration of the two double bonds. Compound 6 is there-
fore considered a new compound, for which the name haplacutine
E is proposed.
The constituent eluted as peak 7 was identiﬁed as (+)-eudesmin
(7) on the basis of 1H NMR spectroscopic data recorded in HPLC–
SPE–NMR mode (see Supplementary Fig. 2), as well as the identity
of 1H and 13C NMR data and optical rotation data (see Supplemen-
tary material) of isolated material with those previously reported
(Iida et al., 1982; Miyazawa et al., 1995; Roy et al., 2002). Eudes-
mine has previously been isolated from Haplophyllum species (Raz-
zakova et al., 1972).
The constituent eluted as peak 8 (compound 8) was assigned the
molecular formula C18H23NO (HRESIFTMS), and the presence of a 4-
quinolinonemoiety and a non-3-en-1-yl side chain was revealed by
correlations in a COSY spectrum. The Z-conﬁgurationwas proved by
comparing the experimental coupling pattern of the double bond
hydrogens with simulated spectra (Fig. 4). This, and the chemical
shift values of C-20 and C-50 (d 27.4 and d 27.7, respectively), estab-
lished the structure of 8 as 2-[(3Z)-non-3-en-1-yl]quinolin-4(1H)-
one, for which the name haplacutine F is proposed.
2-Nonylquinolin-4(1H)-one (9) was identiﬁed as the compound
eluted as peak 9 based on HRESIFTMS data and comparison of 1H
NMR spectra with those reported in literature (Kostova et al., 1999).
NMR and HRMS data for new compounds are reported in Sec-
tion 4, whereas retention times, MS data, and NMR data for known
compounds are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The spectra of 5,
7 and 9 obtained in the hyphenation mode are shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. 2. No useful NMR data could be obtained from the
remaining peaks. Preparative-scale fractionation of extract B of H.
acutifolium, comprising a partitioning between chloroform and di-
lute acid, yielded compounds 1 and 4-7 in small amounts. How-
ever, since the H. acutifolium alkaloids are tautomeric amides,
this standard procedure for alkaloid isolation was not effective,
as highlighted by isolation of 6 from the chloroform fraction as
well as from the acidic fraction (fractions I and III, respectively,
see Section 4). It was not possible to isolate compound 2-3, 8,
and 9 in satisfactory amounts and purity. The antiplasmodial activ-
ity of compounds 4 and 6was assessed in an in vitro antiplasmodial
toxicity assay. Compound 4 and 6 showed IC50 values of
2.17 ± 0.22 lM and 3.79 ± 0.24 lM, respectively, whereas the cor-
responding value for chloroquine diphosphate was 32.8 ± 0.24
nM. Since 4-quinolone alkaloids generally exhibit numerous toxi-
cological activities in the low micromolar range as described in
the Introduction, the observed antiplasmodial activity presumably
represents a general toxic effect.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the fast and dependable
dereplication of alkaloid constituents of crude extract of H. acutifo-
lium by HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR. On-line analysis of nine peaks
led to identiﬁcation of six new and two known 4-quinolinone alka-
loids as well as a hemiterpenoid 2-quinolinone alkaloid and a lig-
nan. In agreement with earlier investigations of tautomeric
equilibria between hydroxyquinolines and quinolinones in solu-
tion (de la Cruz et al., 1992; Mphahlele and El-Nahas, 2004; Tokay
and Ögretir, 2002), the alkaloids are formulated as quinolinones.
The ﬁnding of six new 2-alkylquinolinones in extract of aerial parts
of H. acutifolium shows that reinvestigation of plants with new and
more sensitive technology can add considerable new phytochemi-
cal information to already well-investigated species. In continua-
tion of the HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR investigation, two of the
alkaloids were isolated and were shown to inhibit growth of malar-
ia parasites in the low micromolar range. On the basis of this ﬁnd-
ing, the observed antiplasmodial activity of crude extract of H.
acutifolium is concluded to represent combined effect of quinoli-
none alkaloids present in this plant.
4. Experimental
4.1. General
Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin–Elmer 241
polarimeter. NMR spectra of isolated compounds were recorded
on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (proton frequency
400.13 MHz) at 25 C, using TMS as internal standard. HRMS mea-
surements were performed using a Bruker APEX Qe Fourier-trans-
form mass spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting
cryomagnet and an external ESI source (Apollo II source). The spec-
tra were externally calibrated with arginine cluster in positive and
negative ion mode. The samples were dissolved in MeOH, further
diluted in 50% MeOH with 0.2% HCOOH, and introduced into the
ion source using a syringe pump with a ﬂow of 2 ll/min. Prepara-
tive-scale HPLC separations were performed with a 250  16 mm
Lichrosorb RP18 (5 lm) column at a ﬂow rate of 8 ml/min, using
a chromatograph consisting of a Gynkotek P 580 pump, a Rheo-
dyne 7725 injector, and a Shimadzu SPD-10AV spectrophotometric
detector operating at 254 nm, or with a 250  21.2 mm Luna 2 C18
(5 lm) column at a ﬂow rate of 10 ml/min, using a Waters 590
pump, a Rheodyne 7125 injector, and a Lambda-Max Model 481
LC UV detector operating at 235 nm. Spin coupling pattern simula-
tions were performed with gNMR ver. 4.1.2 software (Adept Scien-
tiﬁc, Herts, UK). Chemical shift predictions were performed with
ChemNMR software as implemented in ChemBioDraw Ultra ver.
11.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, UK).

1650 m) and identiﬁed by Mr. Ali Ahi. The plant material was dried
immediately after collection and powdered before extraction. Vou-
cher specimen (DFHJJ56) was deposited in Herbarium C (Botanical
Museum, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark).
4.3. Extraction and sample preparation
Extract A was prepared by macerating 117 g of the plant mate-
rial with 3  0.5 l of EtOAc, and the combined extracts were evap-
orated to dryness under reduced pressure to give 2.27 g of residue.
A small amount (7.5 mg) of extract A was used for HPLC–PDA–MS–
SPE–NMR analysis by making solutions of 28 mg/ml in H2O–MeCN
2:7, and the rest was used for prep. HPLC. Extract B was prepared
by extraction of 500 g of powdered material with 4  1 l of EtOAc
and evaporation.
4.4. HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR experiments
The HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR instrument consisted of an Agi-
lent 1100 HPLC system (degasser, quaternary solvent delivery
pump, autosampler, PDA detector), a Knauer K100 Wellchrom
pump for post-column H2O delivery, a Spark Prospekt 2 solid-
phase extraction device, a Bruker EsquireLC mass spectrometer
equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) interface, and a Bruker
Avance 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 30-ll inverse
1H{13C} ﬂow-probe operating at 25 C. HPLC separations were per-
formed at 40 C on a 150  4.6 mm i.d., 3 lm particle size, Phe-
nomenex Luna 2 C18 column, using mixtures of H2O–MeCN
95:5 + 0.1% HCOOH (eluent A) and H2O–MeCN 5:95 + 0.1% HCOOH
(eluent B). The eluate from the column was split with an Acurate
splitter, directing 5% of the ﬂow to the mass spectrometer and
95% to the PDA detector. MS spectra were acquired in positive-
ion mode, using drying temperature of 350 C, nebulizer pressure
of 15 psi, and drying gas ﬂow of 15 ml/min. The HPLC solvent ﬂow
(0.8 ml/min) from the PDA detector was diluted with H2O (2 ml/
min) and directed to the SPE unit. GP phase [general-purpose
poly(divinylbenzene)-based resin] SPE cartridges, 10  2 mm i.d.
from Spark Holland, were used for trapping of selected compounds
based on UV absorption levels at 235 nm. Four cumulative trap-
pings of analytes from separation of 1.4 mg of the raw extract
per injection were performed using the following linear gradient
elution proﬁle: 0 min, 19% B; 20 min, 32.2% B; 30 min, 50% B;
50 min, 100% B; 60 min, 100% B; 62 min, 19% B, and 8 min condi-
tioning with 19% B. Two extended separations, allowing separation
of up to 2.8 mg extract per injection, were performed with four or
six adsorptions using the following linear gradient elution proﬁle:
0 min, 19% B; 30 min, 32.2% B; 40 min, 50% B; 60 min, 100% B;
70 min, 100% B; 72 min, 19% B, and 8 min conditioning with 19%
B. Prior to use, the SPE cartridges were conditioned with 500 ll
of MeCN at 6 ml/min and ﬂushed with 500 ll H2O at 1 ml/min.
After trapping, the cartridges were dried with a stream of dry N2
gas for 45 min and the analytes eluted to the NMR ﬂow cell with
CD3CN. The HPLC–PDA–MS–SPE–NMR experiments were con-
trolled with Bruker HyStar ver. 2.3 software. NMR data acquisition
and processing were performed using Bruker XWINNMR ver. 3.1
software. After acquisition of NMR data, the samples were re-
moved from the probe and subjected to HRESIFTMS analysis.
4.5. Preparative-scale isolation
Crude extract B was dissolved in 0.5 l of CHCl3 and the solution
extracted with H2O acidiﬁed to pH 2 with 1 M H2SO4 (7  0.5 l) to
give fractions I (21 g) and II, respectively. Fraction II was alkalized
to pH 11 with concentrated aq. NH3 and extracted with CHCl3,
which after concentration yielded 250 mg of fraction III. Fraction
I was separated by isocratic prep. HPLC (Lichrosorb RP18, MeCN–
H2O 6:4 + 0.1% TFA), resulting in fractions Ia (20.2 mg), Ib
(32.7 mg), and Ic (108.6 mg). These fractions were re-chromato-
graphed to yield 9.6 mg of 6 (Ia: MeCN–H2O 1:1 + 0.1% TFA),
27.6 mg of 5 (Ib: MeCN–H2O 4:6 + 0.1% TFA), and 18 mg of 7 (Ic
MeCN–H2O 6:4 + 0.1% TFA). Fraction III was separated by isocratic
prep. HPLC (Lichrosorb RP18, MeCN–H2O 6:4 + 0.1% TFA), resulting
in fractions IIIa–IIIi. Fractions IIIf and IIIi were re-chromatographed
using MeCN–H2O 1:1 + 0.1% TFA to yield 5 mg of 4 and 10 mg of 6,
respectively. Extract A was subjected to targeted isolation of 1 by
repeated prep. HPLC (Luna 2 C18, MeCN–H2O 22:78) to yield
4 mg of 1.
