The bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum is among the most common
plants (Page, 1976; Taylor, 1990). Ingestion by cattle of either the
whole plant or extracts leads to a syndrome in which there is
pannyeloid bone-marrow damage, pyrexia and often gut-lining
damage and ulceration (Evans et al, 1958). Also typical are wide-
spread petechelial haemorrhages (Evans et al, 1954). The presence
of a carcinogen in fresh bracken ferns was first recognized over 30
years ago by Evans and Mason (1965) in trials on mice and later
confirmed by other workers (Pamacku and Price, 1969; Hirono et
al, 1970). Consumption of bracken fern by cattle has been shown
to induce bladder and intestinal carcinomas (Fenwick, 1965;
Smith, 1990) and to cause a number of diseases in other farm
animals (Evans, 1979; 1986). The presence of haematuria in cattle
fed bracken over long periods has been reported, together with
changes of a polypous-tumerous nature in the bladder mucosa
(Rosenberger, 1960). When introduced into the urinary bladders of
dogs, an extract of urine from cattle fed hay in haematuria districts
produced changes similar to haemangionoma. Application of the
same extracts to the skin of white mice led to papilloma-type
excrescences (Georgiev et al, 1963). Bracken has been identified
as a farm hazard of considerable economic importance (Alonso-
Amelot et al, 1995). Chemical studies of over thirty species of
Pteridaceae have been carried out (Murakami and Tanaka, 1988);
an unstable glucoside named ptaquiloside (Figure 1A) was
isolated (Niwa et al, 1983; Van der Hoeven et al, 1983) and its
potent carcinogenicity proven (Hirono et al, 1984). Ptaquiloside
was shown to break down in aqueous solution in the presence of
acid, base or heat to give pterosin B (Figure 2A, R1 = CH2OH, R3
= H). As well as the above carcinogenic effects, other compounds
present in bracken fern cause a variety of effects such as cyano-
genesis and thiamine deficiency (Smith, 1997).
Three main routes may lead to human exposure to the toxic
effects of bracken fern – eating the plant, physical contact with it or
more particularly the spores, and ingestion of milk from affected
animals. The consumption of the plant is common in Japan and,
although pre-treatment with boiling water or soda ash reduces the
carcinogenicity, the risk of oesophageal cancer is increased approxi-
mately by 2.1 in men and 3.7 in women (Kamon and Hirayama,
1975). Ptaquiloside has been identified in the milk produced by
bracken-fed cows (Alonso-Amelot et al, 1993; 1996); the concentra-
tion in milk has been found to be about 8.5% of the amount ingested
by the cow and is linearly dependent on the dose. The authors indi-
cate that, in their view, it is ‘certainly likely’ that ptaquiloside in
milk is responsible for the connection between bracken infestation
and the incidence of gastric cancer in populations of farmers inhab-
iting cattle-range areas in Costa Rica and other countries where
bracken growth is dense (Villalobos-Salazar, 1985), strongly
suggesting the need to avoid the distribution of this into the food
chain. Indeed neoplasia has been caused by feeding rats with the
milk of cows or rats fed on a bracken fern diet (Evans et al, 1972;
Villalobos-Salazar et al, 1990). A possible spatial association
between bracken and cancer in England and Wales has been exam-
ined (Wells and McNally, 1989), while aerial exposure to spores
may be a problem given the development of neoplasia in mice
treated with spores (Evans et al, 1986; Villalobos-Salazar et al,
1995) and the observation that this treatment leads to DNA adducts
in upper gastrointestinal tissues (Povey et al, 1996).

Summary Consumption of the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum by cattle has been shown to induce bladder and intestinal carcinomas in cattle
and to cause a number of diseases in other farm animals. An unstable glucoside named ptaquiloside, containing a reactive cyclopropane ring,
has been isolated from the fern and its potent carcinogenicity proven. Nineteen of 31 ferns tested by chemotaxonomic methods in Japan have
been found to contain potentially carcinogenic ptaquilosides as have Cheilanthes sieberi and Pteridium esculentum. Hydrolysis of ptaquilosides
leads to pterosins; under milder conditions a dienone which is believed to be the primary carcinogen is obtained. Hypacrone, a sesquiterpine
containing a reactive cyclopropane ring, has been isolated from Hypolepis punctata and its structure proved by synthesis. Illudins, structurally
similar to ptaquiloside, have been isolated from the basidiomycete Omphalotus illudens. These give anti-tumour activity and similar reactivity
with nucleophiles to ptaquiloside. Compound CC-1065, a highly toxic antibiotic also containing a cyclopropane ring, has been isolated from
Streptomyces zelensis. The mechanism of its reactivity with DNA has been compared to that of ptaquiloside and the small structural differences
between carcinogenic and anti-tumour activity discussed. Both CC-1065 and adozelesin, a synthetic analogue with anti-tumour activity, have
been shown to alkylate the N-3 atom of adenine in a certain sequence of DNA. The reactivity of cysteine with ptaquilosides and illudins is
discussed, as is the role of cysteine alkylating agents in apoptosis. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign

This paper originated from the IVth International Bracken Fern Conference (20–23
July 1999)The distribution and structure of ptaquilosides and
pterosins
The distribution of ptaquiloside in a variety of ferns has been
examined using chromatography and a modified Ames test (Saito
et al, 1989). Nineteen of the 31 ferns tested were found to contain
the potentially carcinogenic ptaquilosides. They are listed in Table
1. Variable concentrations are present, but these can be as high as
1.3% of the dry weight (Smith et al, 1992; 1994).
Many species of fern have been found to contain derivatives of
pterosin B or related pterosins (Figure 2A). The structure of some
of these are shown in Table 2 (Fukuoka et al, 1978; Ng and
McMorris, 1984). Pteridium aquilinum has been found to contain
20 kinds of pterosins and pterosides but until recently only
ptaquiloside yielding pterosin B on hydrolysis has been character-
ized (Saito et al, 1989). It was expected that ptaquiloside
analogues would be present in Pteridium aquilinum, which would
on hydrolysis yield pterosin Z and pterosin A. The ptaquiloside
(Figure 1A), precursor to pterosin A, has recently been isolated
from Pteridium aquilinum var. caudatum (Castillo et al, 1997), as
has an epimer of ptaquiloside, isoptaquiloside (Figure 1F) while
the precursor (Figure 1C) of pterosin Z has been isolated from
Pteridium aquilinum subsp. aquilinum (Potter and Pitman, 1994).
This precursor of pterosin Z has also now been isolated from
Pteridium aquilinum var. caudatum (Castillo et al, 1998).
Cheilanthes sieberi, growing in both Australia and New Zealand,
had been found to cause a syndrome indistinguishable from acute
bracken poisoning; Cheilanthes sieberi fronds and croziers collected
from both Australia and New Zealand were found to contain
ptaquiloside (Smith et al, 1990; Agnew and Lauren, 1991). Analysis
of the extracts for pterosin B following base and acid treatment gave
concentrations twice as high as expected for the ptaquiloside alone,
possibly suggesting pterosin B precursors other than ptaquiloside in
Cheilanthes sieberi (Smith et al, 1990).
Further analogues of ptaquiloside have been isolated from other
ferns including hypolosides A, B and C from Hypolepis punctata
and B and C from Dennstaedtia hirsta (Saito et al, 1990), from
which dennstoside A (Figure 1E) was also isolated (Koyama et al,
1991). Hypolosides B and C have the same structure as hypoloside
A (Figure 1D), but with an additional p-coumaroyl group on the 4-
position of the glucose. The only difference between hypolosides
B and C is that they are geometrical isomers with the p-coumaroyl
group existing in the cis and trans isomers respectively.
Hypoloside A, B and C also yield pterosin Z on hydrolysis and
dennstoside A yields pterosin A. Extraction of fresh shoots of
Hypolepis punctata yielded hypacrone (Figure 2B) (Hayashi,
1977a; 1977b), also possessing a reactive cyclopropane ring and
giving pterosin Z on hydrolysis.

structures
Pterosins, which not only are widely occurring in ferns (Hayashi et
al, 1972; Fukuoka et al, 1978; Ng and McMorris, 1984), but also in
certain fungi of the class Basidiomyces including Fomes annosus
and Cyathus bulleri, have been found not to possess carcinogenic
activity, although some show cytotoxicity to HeLa cells (Yoshihira
et al, 1978). Several pterosins produced cytotoxic effects on the
ciliate, Paramecium caudatum and also induced abnormal devel-
opment of urchin embryos (Kobayashi and Koshimizu, 1980).
Pterosin B and O have been isolated from Pteris inequalis and
shown to be active against Bacillus subtilis (Kobayashi et al,
1975). Recently, a substituted indanone, structurally similar to
pterosins, has been approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease in the USA and UK (Gopinath, 1998). This compound,
developed by Eisai and co-marketed by Pfizer has the structure
shown in Figure 3.
The binding-site of this compound in acetylcholinesterase
(ACE) has been investigated and possible structural modifications
for identifying improved ACE inhibitors for the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease discussed (Pang and Kozikowski, 1994).
Biological activity of ptaquilosides and related
structures
Under weakly alkaline conditions both ptaquiloside and its agly-
cone ptaquilosin (Figure 4A) are converted, with D-(+) glucose
liberation in the former case, into the unstable dienone (Figure
4B), which is the activated form regarded as the ultimate
carcinogen (Kigoshi et al, 1993). Both the ileum and the urine of
herbivores are known to be alkaline. In the field, cattle and some-
times sheep grazing on bracken fern develop tumours, most
frequently in the urinary bladder. The 32P-postlabelling assay has
provided evidence for ptaquilosin-DNA adducts in the ileum of
bracken fern-fed calves. Alkylation occurred primarily at the

Figure 4 (A) Ptaquilosin, (B) Unstable dienoneadenine groups; the results suggest that initial alkylation of
adenine by ptaquilosin (ptaquiloside) in codon 61 followed by
depurination and error in DNA synthesis leads to activation of H-
ras proto-oncogene (Prakash et al, 1996).
Ptaquilosin is strongly electrophilic and reacts readily with
amino acids, nucleosides and nucleotides (Ojika et al, 1987) under
mild conditions, forming covalent adducts with DNA and causing
DNA strands to break (Ojika et al, 1989). In a model reaction with
a deoxytetranucleotide, part of which is shown in Figure 5, the
covalent adduct was found at a guanine residue and a corre-
sponding adduct was found at an adenine residue.
Compound CC-1065, a highly toxic antibiotic containing a reac-
tive cyclopropane ring, the structure of which is shown in Figure 6,
has been isolated from Streptomyces zelensis (Hanka et al, 1978;
Kushida et al, 1994). This compound shows significant cytotoxi-
city in vitro and anti-tumour activity in vivo (Kushida
et al, 1994) and is significantly more toxic than actinomycin,
vinblastine or maytanosine (Martin et al, 1978).
CC-1065 is believed to bind to DNA without intercalation
(Swenson et al, 1981). DNA cleavage occurred through a similar
mechanism to that for ptaquiloside, namely by formation of an

Figure 7 Reaction of CC-1065 with DNAalkyladenine adduct by attack of the base on the cyclopropane in a
homo-Michael addition, activated by the adjacent enone system
and leading to the formation of an aromatic adduct, and then to
depurination and strand breakage on heating (Figure 7) (Kushida
et al, 1994). However, two significant differences have been
observed. Ptaquiloside forms adducts at both guanine and adenine
residues and induces the spontaneous cleavage at adenine base
sites under physiological conditions, whereas CC-1065 only
causes cleavage at higher temperature (70°C). At lower tempera-
ture (37°C) the adenine adduct of CC-1065 undergoes a retro-
homo-Michael reaction to regenerate the initial CC-1065 structure
and, it is presumed, intact DNA; the reverse reaction may require
the double helical structure in DNA and be inhibited in melts
(Warpehoski et al, 1992). At the same lower temperature ptaquilo-
side depurinates spontaneously. Adozelesin, a synthetic analogue
of CC-1065 was developed with potent anti-tumour activity; both
this compound and CC-1065 were found to alkylate the N-3 atom
of adenine only in a certain sequence of DNA.
Illudins (Figure 8) structurally similar to ptaquiloside have been
isolated from Omphalotus illudens and related fungi (Anchel et al,
1950; McMorris and Anchel, 1963; 1965) and have been found to
be rapidly cytotoxic to haematopoietic tumours in vitro at
extremely low concentrations (Kelner et al, 1987).
The illudins have been found to be quite reactive at low pH and
to behave as bifunctional alkylating agents (McMorris et al, 1989).
Unlike ptaquiloside, they have been found to react only with thiols
including cysteine (Figure 9) at physiological pH (McMorris et al,
1990).
This reaction is thought to occur through initial attack of the thio-
late at one of the enone systems in illudin to give an intermediate
cyclopropane (Figure 10) which is then ring-opened by attack by
solvent leading to a phenolic system (McMorris et al, 1990).
Illudin M and S failed to react with adenosine and other
nitrogen nucleophiles and do not react directly with DNA. Many
of these compounds are too toxic to find application, however
hydroxymethylacylfulvene (McMorris, 1996) (HMAF) (Figure
11) causes complete tumour regression in all animals at the
maximum tolerated dose, proving effective against breast, lung
and colon cancers in animal models and in human cell cancer
clones (McDonald, 1997). This compound is now available from a
chemical synthesis (McMorris, 1997).
32P-postlabelling analysis of DNA adducts formed in the upper
gastrointestinal tissue of mice fed bracken extract or spores has
shown that similar adducts are formed when two cyclopropane
rings containing compounds 1-(4-chlorophenylsulphonyl)-
1-cyclopropane and 3-cyclopropylindeno [1,2-c]pyrazol-4-(O-
methyl)oxime are used instead (Povey et al, 1996). The cyclo-
propane rings of these compounds are also much more stable to
reaction with nitrogen nucleophiles than ptaquiloside. Also it has
been found that spirocyclopropane-4-piperidinones show
moderate DNA cleaving activity, although again the cyclopropane
rings are less strained and more stable than in ptaquilosides
(Anichini et al, 1997). It is possible that these more stable cyclo-
propanes do not react directly with DNA. For example, the anti-
cancer activity of Taxol, a compound extracted from yew trees, is
mediated by tubulin polymerization and microtubule formation,
thereby blocking the cell cycle in mitosis and inducing
programmed cell death (apoptosis) (Wahl et al, 1996; Kinloch
et al, 1999). Recently, apoptosis has become an area of intense
scientific interest. This is the study of the triggers and mechanisms
involved in cell death (Kinloch et al, 1999). A number of low-
molecular-weight compounds have been shown to enhance or
inhibit this fundamental cellular process. Decrease in the rate of
apoptosis may facilitate the growth of tumours, while blocking a
protein’s anti-apoptotic function is of interest as potential drug
targets for cancer treatment (Kinloch et al, 1999). Molecules
containing a cyclopropane ring, such as ptaquilosides or the
illudins, which react with thiol nucleophiles such as cysteine may
act as cysteine–protease inhibitors, affecting the complex process
of apoptosis giving either carcinogenic or anti-tumour activity
without direct reaction with DNA. This warrants further investiga-
tion. Cysteine alkylating reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and
peptide aldehydes have been shown to be potent inhibitors of
cysteine proteases inhibiting apoptosis (Nicholson et al, 1995).
The control of apoptosis may lead to treatments for degenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
disease, immune deficiency, leukaemias and other cancers.
