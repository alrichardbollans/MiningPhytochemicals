Two new ceramides, N-(4-hydroxyphenethyl)octacosamide (1) and rel-(2S,3S,4R,16E)-2-
[(2’R)-2’-hydroxynonadecanoylamino]-heneicosadec-16-ene-1,3,4-triol (2) were isolated from 
the EtOH extract of Acnistus arborescens. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic (1D 
and 2D NMR experiments, HR-ESI-MS, LR-MS and IR) methods. 
Keywords: Acnistus arborescens, Solanaceae, ceramides
Introduction
The genus Acnistus (Solanaceae) comprises 50 tropical 
American species of shrubs and small trees distributed 
from Mexico to Southern Argentina.1 Plants of this genus 
biosynthesize a complex group of natural C28 steroidal 
lactones, known as acnistins,2 withanolides,3 and jaborols.4 
As part of a collaborative search program to identify novel 
naturally occurring anticancer agents, we have investigated 
Acnistus arborescens (L.) Schlecht.5,6 The plant presents 
different therapeutic uses in the traditional medicine, for 
instance, the hot infusion of leaves and barks is used in the 
treatment of bruises and sprains, moreover, the leaves have 
been used to treat liver and spleen diseases, and cancerous 
growths.1,7,8 Indeed, previous studies on this species have 
led to the isolation of several cytotoxic withanolides.7,8 
Recently, it was published for the first time the isolation 
of withaphysalins, including its cytotoxic effects against 
several tumor cell lines.5,6 
In this paper, the isolation and characterization of two 
new ceramides from A. arborescens is described. This is 
the first examples of ceramides from a plant of the Acnistus 
genus and, to the best of our knowledge, the second 
report about such kind of secondary metabolites from the 
Solanaceae family.9 
Ceramides and related compounds have been isolated 
extensively from fungi10 and several marine organisms 
such as sponges,11 tunicates,12 sea stars,13 green algae14 
and gorgonians.15 However, more recently, this class of 
compound has been isolated from some higher plants.9,16-18
Results and Discussion
The EtOH extracts from leaves and stems of 
A. arborescens were fractionated by column chromatography 
on silica gel by elution with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc 
and MeOH. After several chromatographic procedures 
compound 1 was isolated from the leaves, while compound 
2 was obtained from the stems. The two compounds, after 
detailed spectroscopic analysis, were identified as two new 
ceramides. 
Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous solid. 
Its IR spectrum revealed the absorption bands for either 
secondary amides or hydroxyl groups at 3302 cm−1, an 
amide carbonyl at 1638 cm−1 and skeletal absorptions 
at 1547, 1518 and 1464 cm−1 for aromatic rings. The 
molecular formula of 1, C36H65NO2, was determined on 
the basis of high-resolution ESI mass spectrometry in 
New Ceramides from Acnistus arborescens J. Braz. Chem. Soc.868
the negative mode ([M-H]−) at m/z 542.4907 (C36H64NO2, 
calc. 542.4937). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited an 
amide proton at d 8.72 (s), two signals, both integrating 
for two aromatic hydrogens, at d 7.25 (d, J 8.5 Hz, 
H-2/H-6) and 7.15 (d, J 8.5 Hz, H-3/H-5), a multiplet at 
d 3.76 (2H-8) characteristic of the methylene attached 
to the amide nitrogen and a triplet at d 2.97 (J 7.5 Hz, 
2H-7) for the benzyl methylene. As expected, the COSY 
spectrum showed vicinal scalar coupling for the former 
methylene with the benzyl methylene and the amide 
hydrogen. Additionally, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a 
signal at d 2.41 (t, J 7.5 Hz, 2H-2’) typical of methylene 
group a to a carbonyl, as well as signals for a terminal 
methyl group at 0.89 (t, J 6.5 Hz, 3H-28’) and a series of 
aliphatic methylene hydrogens (d 1.39-1.26). The 13C NMR 
spectra of 1 showed the presence of a carbonyl signal at 
d 174.3 (C-1’) for an amide, signals at d 158.7 (C-4), 
131.8 (C-1), 131.7 (C-2/C-6) and 117.6 (C-3/C-5) that 
justify a para-substituted phenol moiety and two signals 
at d 43.0 (C-8) and 36.9 (C-7) for the nitrogenated and 
benzyl methylene carbons, respectively. The 13C NMR 
spectrum also revealed a series of signals at d 33.4-24.2 
for the methylene carbons, in addition to a signal at d 15.5 
for a terminal methyl group, suggesting that compound 
1 possessed a long alkyl chain. The observed HMBC 
correlations for the methylene protons at d 3.76 (2H-8) 
with the carbons at d 174.3 (C-1’) and 131.8 (C-1) 
allowed to determine a N-(4-hydroxyphenethyl)amide 
moiety, also justified by the fragment ion peaks at m/z 179 
([p-HO-C6H4-CH2CH2NHCOCH3]+·, deriving from a 
McLafferty rearrangement), 120 ([p-HO-C6H4-CH=CH2]+·) 
and 107 ([p-HO-C6H4-CH2]+), in the EI-MS spectrum. 
Accordingly with the afore mentioned spectral data, the 
structure of 1 was characterized as the N-(4-hydroxyphenethyl)
octacosamide, an unknown ceramide up to date. 
Compound 2 was also isolated as a white amorphous 
solid. Its IR spectrum revealed several broad peaks in 
the range of 3399-3227 cm−1 characteristic of bonded 
N-H or O-H stretching, the amide carbonyl at 1621 cm−1, 
followed by the N-H bending at 1544 cm−1. A shoulder at 
higher frequency than the carbonyl absorption followed 
by the band at 964 cm−1 is in accordance with a trans 
carbon-carbon double bond. The long aliphatic chain was 
characterized by a band at 723 cm−1. The molecular formula 
of 2, C40H79NO5, was determined on the basis of high-
resolution ESI mass spectroscopy in the negative mode 
([M-H]−) at m/z 652.5983 (C40H78NO5, calc. 652.5880). 
The 1H NMR spectrum showed characteristic signal for 
an amide proton at d 8.60 (d, J 8.9 Hz), resonances for 
four hydroxyl groups at d 7.63, 6.72 (integrating for two 
hydrogens) and 6.10, all appearing as broad singlet; a signal 
at d 5.15 (m, H-2) for a methine bonded to a nitrogen; 
signals at d 4.54 (dd, J 10.9 and 4.5 Hz, H-1a) and 4.44 
(dd, J 10.9 and 4.8 Hz, H-1b) for a hydroxymethylene, as 
well as signals at d 4.64 (H-2´), 4.38 (m, H-3) and 4.32 
(m, H-4) corresponding to three oxymethines. Additionally, 
signals for a double bond at d 5.59 (td, J 15.4 and 5.4 Hz, 
H-16) and 5.50 (td, J 15.4 and 5.8 Hz, H-17), two terminal 
methyl at d 0.88 (t, J 6.2 Hz, 3H-19´/3H-21) and several 
methylene hydrogens at d 2.29-1.28 corresponding to two 
aliphatic chains were also observed. The COSY spectrum 
revealed coupling for the methine attached to the nitrogen 
(H-2) with the oxymethylene (2H-1) and an oxymethine 
(H-3) protons, and the latter with the oxymethine H-4. 
As expected, the 13C NMR spectra of 2 exhibited three 
downfield carbon signals at d 175.7 (C-1’), 131.3 (C-16) 
and 131.2 (C-17) corresponding to a carbonyl amide and 
a double bond, respectively. Signals for a nitrogenated 
methine at d 54.4 (C-2), an oxymethylene at d 62.5 (C-1) 
and three oxymethynes at d 77.2 (C-3), 73.5 (C-4) and 72.9 
(C-2’). In addition, several carbon signals in the range of d 
36.2-23.4 related to methylene groups and a carbon signal 
at 14.8 corresponding to two terminal methyls were also 
deduced from 13C NMR spectra, suggesting that compound 
2 was also a ceramide. The unequivocal positions of the 
hydroxyl groups were deduced based on the HMBC 
spectrum in which the proton signal at d 8.60 (NH) showed 
correlations with the carbonyl (C-1’) and the nitrogenated 
methine (C-2), while the proton signal at d 5.15 (H-2) 
exhibited correlations with the carbon signals at d 62.5

(C-1), 77.2 (C-3) and 73.5 (C-4). Furthermore, HMBC 
correlation between the proton signal at 4.64 (H-2´) and 
the carbonyl (C-1’) confirmed the presence of a side chain 
of a a-hydroxy fatty acid. Subsequently, the four hydroxyl 
groups were confirmed through the acetylated compound 
(2a). The HMQC spectrum showed the obvious additional 
methyl signals at dH/dC 2.23/21.2, 2.13/21.1, 2.10/21.5 and 
2.08/21.3 characteristic of the four acetyl moieties. Through 
the HMBC spectra of both compounds 2 and 2a the double 
bond was assigned at C-16 and C-17 of the sphingoid chain. 
HMBC correlations found for 3H-21 (d 0.88) and H-17 
(d 5.50) with C-19 (d 32.6) supported this deduction. The 
E-configuration established for C-16/C-17 double bond 
was determined through the large vicinal coupling constant 
(J 15.4 Hz) displayed between H-16 and H-17. The low 
resolution mass spectrum of 2 was crucial to the definition of 
the amide and of the sphingoid portions length. The peaks at 
m/z 384, 357 and 339 were in agreement with the sphingoid 
moiety when combined with the peaks at m/z 298 and 280, 
represented by the structural fragments sketched in Figure 
S10 (Supplementary Information), were congruent with 
the proposed structure. After comparison with analogous 
compounds16-18 the relative stereochemistry inferred for the 
stereocenters 2, 3, 4 and 2’ was presumed to be S*, S*, R* 
and R*, respectively. On the basis of the above mentioned 
data, the structure of compound 2 was established as rel-
(2S,3S,4R,16E)-2-[(2’R)-2’-hydroxynonadecanoylamino]-
heneicosadec-16-ene-1,3,4-triol. 
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were measured on a digital Mettler Toledo 
FP90 apparatus and are uncorrected. The optical rotations 
were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 digital polarimeter. 
IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1000 
spectrometer. Electrospray ionization-High resolution 
mass spectra were measured on a quadrupole-time of flight 
instrument (UltrOTOF-Q, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, 
MA), while the low resolution Electron ionization mass 
spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu QP5050A instrument, 
through direct probe and operating at 70 eV. All NMR 
experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance DRX-500 
spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm inverse detection 
z-gradient probe. 1H NMR (500.13 MHz) and 13C NMR 
(125.77 MHz) spectra were measured at 27 °C using 
pyridine-d5 as solvent. Chemical shifts, given on the d scale, 
were referenced to the residual pyridine [dH 8.74, 7.58, 7.22; 
dC 150.35, 135.91, 123.87]. Column chromatography was 
run using silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh, Vetec; 230-400 mesh, 
Merck) and TLC was performed on precoated silica gel 
polyester sheets (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.20 mm, Merck) by 
detection with a spray reagent of vanillin/perchloric acid/
EtOH solution followed by heating at 100 °C.
Plant material
Acnistus arborescens was harvested in August 2006, 
in the Pico Alto locality (Guaramiranga Mountain, State 
of Ceará), at an elevation of 1000 m. The plant material 
was identified by Professor Edson P. Nunes. A voucher 
specimen (No. 30.513) is deposited in the Herbário 
Prisco Bezera (EAC) of the Departamento de Biologia, 
Universidade Federal do Ceará.
Extraction and isolation
The leaves (3.7 kg) and stems (3.0 kg) of A. arborescens 
were separately soaked with EtOH (2×) at room temperature 
for 72 h. The extracts were concentrated under vacuum and 
the residues (leaves = 170 g; stems = 57 g) fractioned over 
silica gel using n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH 
as eluents. The CH2Cl2 fraction (45 g), obtained from 
the leaf EtOH extract, was subjected to gravity column 
chromatography over silica gel by elution with n-hexane 
and n-hexane:EtOAc in increasing order of polarity. The 
n-hexane:EtOAc fraction 6:4 (24.1 g) after repeated column 
chromatography yielded compound 1 (30 mg) by elution 
with CH2Cl2:EtOAc (8:2). The EtOAc fraction (15.5 g), 
originated from the stem EtOH extract, was subjected 
to Si-gel column chromatography using gradients of 
increasing amounts of EtOAc (20-100%) in n-hexane, 
followed by EtOAc:MeOH (9:1) to afford 8 fractions 
(A-H) on the basis of TLC profile. Fraction G (46 mg) 
was subjected to silica gel flash chromatography using 
EtOAc:MeOH (9.5:0.5) to afford compound 2 (18 mg).
