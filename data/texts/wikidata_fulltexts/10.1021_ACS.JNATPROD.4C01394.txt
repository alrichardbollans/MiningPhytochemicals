In this study,we isolated one new dihydrophenanthrene derivative (1), two newbibenzyl-dihydrophenanthrene derivatives (2, 3) along with 12 knowncompounds (4−15) from the methanol extract of Calanthecardioglossa. These compounds were identified by using physicochem-ical analyses and spectroscopic methods. The three new compoundspossess enantiomeric forms, and their configurations were determinedby comparing the experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD)spectra to data from the literature. The immunomodulatory activity ofthe isolated compounds was assessed in THP-1 monocytes andhuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived frommultiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Notably, five of the isolatedcompounds significantly reduced the TNF-α levels in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, calancardin B (2) exhibiteda significant reduction in TNF-α levels in both THP-1 monocytes and CD14+ monocytes from MS PBMCs.The Orchidaceae family is the second largest amongangiosperms, encompassing approximately 850 generaand 20,000 species. This family plays a significant role in thecommercial cut flower industry, and many of its species havedocumented uses as remedies for various diseases.1 The genusCalanthe has a rich history of use in traditional medicine acrossChina (Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM), Thailand, India(Ayurveda), Indonesia, and Nepal for treating a range ofailments. In TCM, around 14 species of Calanthe are utilized inphytotherapy to address health issues such as traumaticinjuries, edema, and pain relief for conditions such as jointpain, toothaches, and abdominal discomfort.2−4 Moreover,various bioactive compounds isolated from Calanthe speciesincluding phenanthrenes, phenanthrenequinones, calanthoside,and 6′-O-β-D-apiofuranosylindican have demonstrated signifi-cant biological activities, including antiplatelet aggregation,anticancer effects, and hair restoration.5−9 Calanthe cardioglossaSchltr. is a terrestrial orchid distributed throughout Thailand,Laos, and Vietnam. This plant has been used as a tonic in Thaiethnomedicine2,10 and has not yet been reported in anyphytochemical studies. Therefore, investigating the compoundspresent in this plant for their biological activities is particularlyintriguing.Inflammation is a natural process that helps the body healand defend itself from harm. A dynamic balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes is essential forcontrolling disease and limiting pathology. However, wheninflammation persists and becomes chronic, it can bedetrimental. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in manydiseases, and prolonged periods of covert or subclinicalinflammation may precede organ damage, leading to clinicalmanifestations, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD),type 2 diabetes (T2D), and neurological diseases. Strengthen-ing the human immune system is a potential strategy foraddressing disease pathogenesis and reducing mortality.Immunomodulatory treatments that utilize phytochemicalsderived from plants are gaining attention as promisingapproaches to combat various diseases such as cancer,11neuroinflammation12 and infections.13 Medicinal plants areexcellent sources of bioactive compounds; they are affordable,widely accessible, and generally associated with fewer sideeffects, making them ideal candidates for drug development.Notable immune-active bioactive molecules from plantsinclude bibenzyls,11,14 phenanthrenes,12 alkaloids,15,16 andterpenoids.17 Additionally, active compounds derived fromorchids have been reported to exhibit immunomodulatoryeffects.11,12,14 This study aimed to isolate compounds from C.cardioglossa and to evaluate their immunomodulatory activityReceived: December 5, 2024Revised: January 16, 2025Accepted: January 18, 2025Published: January 29, 2025Articlepubs.acs.org/jnp© 2025 The Authors.

Themolecular formula was determined to be C30H26O6 based onits [M−H]− ion at m/z 481.1637 (calcd 481.1651 forC30H25O6) in the HR-ESI-MS. The IR spectrum showed theabsorption bands at 3338 (hydroxyl groups), 1551 and 1465(aromatic rings) cm−1, and UV maxima at 217, 279, and 298nm, which corresponded to dihydrophenanthrene skele-ton.20,21 The 1H NMR spectrum presented characteristics ofdimeric dihydrophenanthrene with signals of four methylenegroups at δH 2.52 (4H, m, H2-9 and H2-10) and δH 2.75 (4H,m, H2-9′ and H2-10′).For the first dihydrophenanthrene moiety (rings A and B),1H NMR showed signals for a singlet aromatic proton at δH6.59 (1H, s, H-3), the ABX spin system at δH 6.66 (1H, br s,H-8), δH 6.68 (1H, dd, J = 8.4, 2.8 Hz, H-6), δH 8.06 (1H, d, J= 8.4 Hz, H-5), a methoxy group at δH 3.87 (3H, s, MeO-4)and a hydroxyl proton at δH 8.17 (1H, s, HO-7) (Table 1).The locations of H-3 and H-5 were assigned by their HMBCconnection with C-4a (δC 116.9). The HMBC correlationbetween H-8 and C-9 (δC 30.5) was also observed (Figure 1).The methoxy group was attached at C-4 (δC 157.8) confirmedby its NOESY cross-peak with H-3 and H-5 (Figure 2).Therefore, the first phenanthrene moiety was 2,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene with C-1 substitution.For the second dihydrophenanthrene moiety (rings A′ andB′), the 1H NMR spectrum displayed two meta-coupledaromatic protons at δH 6.39 (1H, d, J = 2.8 Hz, H-1′) and δH6.40 (1H, d, J = 2.8 Hz, H-3′), two singlet aromatic protons atδH 6.84 (1H, s, H-8′) and δH 8.15 (1H, s, H-5′), a methoxygroup at δH 3.74 (3H, s, MeO-2′) and one hydroxyl proton atδH 8.56 (1H, s, HO-4′) (Table 1). The assignments of H-1′and H-8′ were deduced from their HMBC correlations to C-10′ (δC 31.5) and C-9′ (δC 30.4), respectively. Theassignments of H-3′ and H-5′ were confirmed by theirHMBC correlations with C-4a′ (δC 115.7) (Figure 1). Thelocation of the methoxy group at C-2′ was supported by itsNOESY interactions with H-1′ and H-3′ (Figure 2). So, thesecond moiety of dihydrophenanthrene was 4′,7′-dihydroxy-2′-methoxy-9′,10′-dihydrophenanthrene with C-6′ substitution.The connection between the two moieties of dihydrophe-nanthrene at C-1 (δC 117.3) and C-6′ (δC 121.3) was deducedby the HMBC correlations from H-5′ to C-1. Theexperimental ECD spectrum of compound 1 exhibited negativeCotton effects at 248 and 314 nm, and a positive Cotton effectTable 1. 1H (400 M Hz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) SpectralData of Compound 1 in Acetone-d6 (δ in ppm, J in Hz)1Position δH (J in Hz) δC, type1 117.3, C2 154.9, C3 6.59, s 99.0, CH4 157.8, C4a 116.9, C4b 126.0, C5 8.06, d (8.4) 130.1, CH6 6.68, dd (8.4, 2.8) 113.3, CH7 156.0, C8 6.66, br s 114.6, CH8a 140.2, C9 2.52, m 30.5, CH210 2.52, m 28.5, CH210a 140.8, C1′ 6.39, d (2.8) 106.0, CH2′ 159.4, C3′ 6.40, d (2.8) 101.5, CH4′ 155.9, C4a′ 115.7, C4b′ 126.2, C5′ 8.15, s 132.6, CH6′ 121.3, C7′ 153.9, C8′ 6.84, s 115.6, CH8a′ 139.3, C9′ 2.75, m 30.4, CH210′ 2.75, m 31.5, CH210a 141.4, CMeO-4 3.87, s 55.7, CH3MeO-2′ 3.74, s 55.3, CH3HO-7 8.17, sHO-4′ 8.56, sFigure 1.

Prod. 2025, 88, 537−545538at 271 nm (Figure 3). This spectral feature is closely matchedwith the calculated ECD spectrum of the blestrianol B fromBletilla striata,22 therefore the absolute configuration ofcompound 1 was assigned as (aR,a′R,a″S)-configuration.From the evidence mentioned above, it leads to the structurecompound 1 as shown and is named calancardin A.Compound 2 was isolated as a brown amorphous solid. Theformula was determined to be C31H30O6 based on its [M−H]−ion at m/z 497.1914 (calcd 497.1964 for C31H29O6) in theHR-ESI-MS. The IR spectrum exhibited the absorption bandsat 3337 (hydroxyl groups), 1576 and 1444 (aromatic rings)cm−1. The UV spectrum showed maximum absorption at 203,279, and 298 nm, suggesting a bibenzyl-dihydrophenanthreneskeleton.20,22 This was confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR, andHSQC spectra. Two methylene groups at δH 2.76 (4H, m, H2-9 and H2-10) with HSQC correlations to the carbon atom atδC 29.6 (C-9) and δC 30.6 (C-10) and two methylene groupsat δH 2.63 (2H, m, H2-α′) and 2.69 (2H, m, H2-α″) withHSQC correlations to the carbon at δC 37.0 (C-α′) and δC37.3 (C-α″) exhibited characteristics of dihydrophenanthreneand bibenzyl, respectively.23For the dihydrophenanthrene moiety (rings A and B), the1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 2) closely resembled that ofthe second dihydrophenanthrene moiety of compound 1. The1H NMR spectrum displayed two doublet aromatic protons atδH 6.39 (1H, d, J = 2.8 Hz, H-1) and δH 6.41 (1H, d, J = 2.8Hz, H-3), two singlet aromatic protons at δH 6.85 (1H, s, H-8)and δH 8.24 (1H, s, H-5), one methoxy group at δH 3.74 (3H,s, MeO-2) and two hydroxyl protons at δH 7.59 (1H, s, HO-7)and δH 8.58 (1H, s, HO-4). A NOESY interaction of MeO-2with H-1 and H-3 places the methoxy group at C-2 (Figure 2).From the above evidence, the first moiety of compound 2 was4,7-dihydroxy-2-methoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene with a C-6 substitution.For bibenzyl moiety (rings A′ and B′), the 1H NMR signalsrevealed two meta-coupled aromatic protons at δH 6.37 (1H, d,J = 2.4 Hz, H-4′) and δH 6.44 (1H, d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-6′), a setof aromatic proton for meta-substituted benzene at δH 6.49(1H, t, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2″), δH 6.55 (1H, br d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-6″),δH 6.57 (1H, t, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5″), and δH 6.59 (1H, ddd, J =8.0, 2.8, 0.8 Hz, H-4″), two methoxy groups at δH 3.31 (3H, s,MeO-3″) and δH 3.76 (3H, s, MeO-5′) and one hydroxylproton (δH 7.31, 1H, s, HO-3′) (Table 2). The assignment ofH-6′ was referenced from the HMBC correlation to C-α′ andC-2′ (δC 117.5). The position of H-2″ and H-6″ wasconfirmed by three-bond correlation to C-α″ in the HMBCspectrum. In addition, the 1H−1H COSY of H-5″ with H-4″and H-6″ was observed (Figure 1). The location of MeO-5′ atC-5′ (δC = 159.9) was confirmed by its NOESY correlationswith H-4′ and H-6′. The attachment of MeO at C-3″ (δC159.7) was inferred by its NOESY correlations with H-2″ andH-4″ (Figure 2). Thus, this bibenzyl moiety was 3′-hydroxy-5′,3″-dimethoxybibenzyl with C-2′ substitution.Figure 2. Key NOESY correlations of compounds 1−3.Figure 3.

Prod. 2025, 88, 537−545539Compound 2 was derived from dihydrophenanthrene andbibenzyl moieties which connected at C-6 (δC 120.2) and C-2′by the HBMC correlation of H-5 with C-2′. The experimentalECD spectrum of this compound showed a negative Cottoneffect at 254 nm and a positive Cotton effect at 282 nm (Figure3). The absolute configuration of compound 2 was assessed as(aS,a′S)-configuration when compared to (aS,a′S)-blestanol Hfrom previous reported.22 We named compound 2 calancardinB.Compound 3 was obtained as a brown amorphous solid.The molecular formula was C31H30O7 based on its [M−H]−ion at m/z 513.1859 (calcd 513.1913 for C31H29O7) in theHR-ESI-MS. The IR spectrum exhibited the absorption bandsat 3305 cm−1 (hydroxyl groups), 2952 and 1638 cm−1(aromatic rings). This compound was proposed to be abibenzyl-dihydrophenanthrene skeleton based on the max-imum UV absorption peaks at 204 and 281 nm,23 along withNMR spectra of dihydrophenanthrene characteristic [twosignals of methylene protons at δH 2.39 (2H, m, H2-10) and atδH 2.52 (2H, t, J = 7.2 Hz, H2-9) with two methylene carbonsignals at δC 28.3 (C-10) and at δC 30.6 (C-9)] and bibenzylcharacteristic [four methylene proton signals at δH 2.84 (4H,br s, H2-α′ and H2-α″) with two methylene carbon signals atδC 38.1 (C-α″) and at δC 39.0 (C-α′)]. The 1H and 13C NMRdata (Table 2) of dihydrophenanthrene moiety in compound 3(rings A and B) was strikingly similar to the firstdihydrophenanthrene moiety of compound 1. The 1H NMRexhibited the following signals: a singlet aromatic proton at δH6.58 (1H, s, H-3), an ABX system proton at δH 6.68 (1H, br s,H-8), δH 6.69 (1H, dd, J = 8.8, 2.0 Hz, H-6), δH 8.06 (1H, d, J= 8.8 Hz, H-5), a methoxy group at δH 3.87 (3H, s, MeO-4)and a hydroxyl proton (δH 8.16, 1H, s, HO-7). The positionsof H-3 and H-5 were confirmed by their HMBC correlationswith C-4a (δC 116.8). H-8 was assigned by its HMBCcorrelation with C-9. The attachment of the methoxy group toC-4 (δC 157.7) was referenced from its NOESY correlationwith H-3 and H-5 (Figure 2). Consequently, the structure ofthe dihydrophenanthrene moiety of compound 3 was 2,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene with C-1 sub-stitution.In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum displayed three meta-coupled aromatic protons at δH 6.24 (1H, t, J = 2.0 Hz, H-4′),δH 6.31 (1H, br t, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6′), and δH 6.32 (1H, br t, J =2.0 Hz, H-2′), a pair of meta-coupled aromatic proton at δH6.54 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6″) and δH 6.87 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz,H-2″), together with three singlet protons at δH 3.71 (3H, s,MeO-5′), δH 3.89 (3H, s, MeO-3″), and δH 8.21 (1H, s, HO-3′) (Table 2). The position of H-2′ and H-6′ was assigned bythe HMBC correlation to C-α′ and C-4′ (δC 99.7). Theassignment of H-2″ and H-6″ was referenced from the HMBCcross-peak to C-α″ and C-4″ (δC 143.6) (Figure 1). Moreover,two methoxy groups were placed at C-5′ (δC 161.8) and C-3″(δC 148.3) based on their NOESY correlation from MeO-5′ toH-4′ and H-6′ and MeO-3″ to H-2″ (Figure 2). Therefore, thesecond moiety of compound 3 was 3′,4″-dihydroxy-5′,3″-dimethoxybibenzyl with C-5″ substitution.The connection at C-1 (δC 117.3) and C-5″ (δC 123.5) ofthe two moieties was deduced by the HMBC correlation fromH-6″ to C-1. Furthermore, the experimental ECD spectrum ofcompound 3 displayed a positive Cotton effect at 254 nm anda negative Cotton effect at 282 nm (Figure 3), for which theabsolute configuration of compound 3 was assessed as(aR,a′R)-configuration by comparison with (aR,a′R)-blestanolF from literature data.22 From the aforementioned evidence,the structure of compound 3 was finally determined andnamed calancardin C.Calancardin A (1) is a dimer of dihydrophenanthrene.Calancardins B (2) and C (3) were dimers of dihydrophenan-threne and bibenzyl, which were less common than dimersformed between dihydrophenanthrene and dihydrophenan-threne/phenanthrene.24 Bibenzyl-dihydrophenanthrene deriv-atives have mostly been reported to be found in orchidsincluding Bletilla formosana,25 Bletilla striata,22,26 Dendrobiumparishii,27 Dendrobium signatum,28 Pholidota chinensis,23Pholidota yunnanensis,20 and Pleione bulbocodioides.29,30 Addi-tionally, 12 known compounds were isolated from the wholeplant of C. cardioglossa: 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazo-linone (4),31 batatasin III (5),32 gigantol (6),33 coelonin (7),34lusianthridin (8),20 ephemeranthoquinone (9),35 gymconopinC (10),36 blestriarene A (11),37 phochinenin G (12),23bletillatin A (13),26 (2,3-trans)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphen-y l ) - 3 - h y d r o x y m e t h y l - 1 0 - m e t h o x y - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 -Table 2. 1H (400 M Hz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) SpectralData of Compounds 2−3 in Acetone-d6 (δ in ppm)2 3Position δH (J in Hz) δC, type δH (J in Hz) δC, type1 6.39, d (2.8) 105.2, CH 117.3, C2 158.5, C 154.5, C3 6.41, d (2.8) 100.6, CH 6.58, s 99.0, CH4 155.1, C 157.7, C4a 114.9, C 116.8, C4b 125.3, C 126.0, C5 8.24, s 132.0, CH 8.06, d (8.8) 130.1, CH6 120.2, C 6.69, dd (8.8,2.0)113.3, CH7 153.1, C 156.0, C8 6.85, s 114.7, CH 6.68, br s 114.6, CH8a 138.5, C 140.2, C9 2.76, m 29.6, CH2 2.52, t (7.2) 30.6, CH210 2.76, m 30.6, CH2 2.39, m 28.3, CH210a 140.5, C 140.3, C1′ 143.4, C 145.1, C2′ 117.5, C 6.32, br t(2.0)108.9, CH3′ 156.1, C 159.2, C4′ 6.37, d (2.4) 99.1, CH 6.24, t (2.0) 99.7, CH5′ 159.9, C 161.8, C6′ 6.44, d (2.4) 106.4, CH 6.31, br t(2.0)106.3, CH1″ 144.1, C 133.4, C2″ 6.49, t (2.0) 113.5, CH 6.87, d (2.0) 111.7, CH3″ 159.7, C 148.3, C4″ 6.59, ddd (8.0,2.8, 0.8)111.3, CH 143.6, C5″ 6.57, t (8.0) 128.9, CH 123.5, C6″ 6.55, br d (8.0) 120.4, CH 6.54, d (2.0) 124.8, CHα′ 2.63, m 37.0, CH2 2.84, br s 39.0, CH2α″ 2.69, m 37.3, CH2 2.84, br s 38.1, CH2MeO-2 3.74, s 54.4, CH3MeO-4 3.87, s 55.7, CH3MeO-5′ 3.76, s 54.4, CH3 3.71, s 55.2, CH3MeO-3″ 3.31, s 54.2, CH3 3.89, s 56.2, CH3HO-4 8.58, sHO-7 7.59, s 8.16, sHO-3′ 7.31, s 8.21, sJournal of Natural Products pubs.acs.org/jnp Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.4c01394J.

In our previousstudy,14 a concentration at 10 μM of bibenzyls has been shownto have good immunomodulatory effects in an in vitro model ofLPS-induced inflammation in human primary peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, we also used theconcentration of 10 μM to further evaluate the immunomo-dulatory effects under LPS stimulation of the purifiedcompounds in the THP-1 cell line as well as in humanPBMCs. Utilizing the THP-1 cell line, five compoundsincluding calancardin A (1), calancardin B (2), batatasin III(5), gigantol (6), and lusianthridin (8) demonstrated asignificant reduction in LPS-induced TNF-α productioncompared to the control group (Figure 4B). Among thesefive active compounds, calancardin B (2) exhibited the mostpronounced activity in reducing the level of TNF-α productionfollowing LPS stimulation. Consequently, we further inves-tigated its immunomodulatory effects on primary humanPBMCs. To achieve this, we conducted in vitro assessmentsusing PBMCs isolated from five patients with MS (pwMS).In brief, PBMCs were stimulated with LPS following apreviously described method.12,14 Four hours after LPSstimulation, we determined the expression of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in multiple cell types, including CD3+ Tce l l s , CD14+ monocy t e s , CD19−HLADR+ andCD19−HLADR− myeloid cells, as well as CD19+ B cellsusing flow cytometry (Figure 5). Unstimulated PBMCs servedas negative controls. No changes in IFN-γ and IL-2 could beobserved in all cell populations after LPS stimulation. Asexpected, we observed an increased expression of TNF-α inCD14+ monocytes but not in other immune cell population(Figure 5). This specificity of monocytes in responding to LPSis attributed to the binding of LPS to TLR4 receptors, whichfacilitates TNF-α expression with the assistance of CD14, amarker unique to monocytes.40PBMCs from pwMS that were coincubated with calancardinB (2) (PBMCs + LPS + calancardin B) demonstrated asignificant reduction in LPS-induced TNF-α production inCD14+ monocytes, as compared with LPS-stimulated PBMCswithout calancardin B treatment (i.e., PBMCs + LPS) (Figure6). It is well established that pwMS present both functionaland compositional alterations in their monocyte populations,particularly an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokinessuch as TNF-α during the active phases of the disease, whichcontribute to neuroinflammation.41,42 Our findings suggest acorrelation between monocyte activation and disease activity,underscoring the central role of monocytes in MS pathology.Consequently, modulating monocyte activity presents apromising therapeutic strategy for MS. Approaches aimed atenhancing the anti-inflammatory functions of monocytes orinhibiting their pro-inflammatory actions could lead to noveltreatment options for this condition.The most potent compound, calancardin B (2), is a dimerformed from 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (monomer: lusian-thridin, 8) and bibenzyl (monomer: 3′-O-methylbatatasin III).It has demonstrated the ability to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-αexpression in both THP-1 monocytes and PBMCs frompwMS. The effects of calancardin B may be enhanced by thesynergistic action of its two monomers, both of which arecapable of reducing TNF-α production following LPSstimulation in THP-1 monocytes and PBMCs. In examiningthe structure−activity relationships (SAR) of five activecompounds (compounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 8) within the THP-1monocyte model, it was observed that two bibenzylcompounds (batatasin III (5) and gigantol (6)) andcalancardin B (2), a bibenzyl-dihydrophenanthrene derivative(a dimer of lusianthridin (8) and 3′-O-methyl-batatasin III)exhibited low activity in inhibiting TNF-α production afterLPS stimulation. These compounds share a core structurefeaturing a methoxy group at C-5 and a hydroxy group at C-3within the bibenzyl moiety. Furthermore, it is plausible tosuggest that a methoxy group at C-3′, combined with theabsence of substitution at C-4′, would yield higher activitycompared to that of having a hydroxy group at C-3′. Thisaligns with our previous findings, which indicated that bibenzylcompounds associated with the inhibition of LPS-inducedTNF expression in PBMCs possess three methoxy groupslocated at C-3, C-5, and C-3′.14 For dihydrophenanthrenederivatives, calancardin A (1) (a dimer of lusianthridin (8) andcoelonin (7)) and lusianthridin (8) resulted in a slightdecrease in TNF-α levels in THP-1 monocytes stimulated withLPS, while coelonin (7) did not demonstrate any inhibitoryeffect in these cells. The distinction between these 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene compounds lies in their structuralfeatures: lusianthridin (8) contains a methoxy group at C-2and a hydroxy group at C-4, whereas calancardin A (1), whichis derived from lusianthridin (8) and coelonin (7), along withFigure 4.

Nat.

Thisfinding indicates that calancardin B may exert beneficialimmunomodulatory effects, thereby offering promising pros-pects for the development of treatments targeting immune-related inflammatory diseases.■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures.

THP-1 cells weremaintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep at 5% CO2 and 37°C. For cell viability testing, the PrestoBlue cell viability reagent wasused as in the previous study with slight modifications.43 Cells wereseeded at 1 × 106 cells/mL into 96-well plate (Corning, Jiangsu,Chaina) and treated with various concentrations of compounds fromC. cardioglossa for 4 h, then PrestoBlue was added, and the cells wereincubated for 30 min in dark conditions at 37 °C. After that, theabsorbance was measured at a fluorescence excitation 560 nm and anemission 590 nm using a microplate reader (CLARIOstar, BMGLabtech, Germany). For TNF-α screening, the same method withprevious study44 was performed with some modifications. Briefly,THP-1 cells at 5 × 105 cells/mL were seeded into 24-well plate(Corning, ME, USA), then 100 μM of LPS and 10 μM of eachcompound were put into well. After 4 h, the medium was collected tomeasure the TNF-α with an ELISA kit.Ethics and Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMCs). The Ethics for this study was approved by the EthicsCommittee of Charite Universitaẗsmedizin Berlin (EA1/187/17).Buffy coats were obtained from five patients with multiple sclerosis.Human MS PBMCs were isolated and then cryopreserved in liquidnitrogen tank as described in a prior study.12LPS Stimulation in PBMCs. Frozen human MS PBMCs werethawed and resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS.Cells were seeded in an ultralow-attachment 96-well plate (Corning,New York, USA) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. Then,calancardin B (2) (10 μM) was added to the corresponding well.After that, cells were stimulated for inflammatory condition using LPS(100 ng/mL) and further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently,brefeldin A (10 μg/mL) was added to the wells and then incubatedfor 2 h. Eventually, all cells were harvested and washed with PBS thenanalyzed using flow cytometry as described below.Cytokines in LPS-Treated MS PBMCs Measurement UsingFlow Cytometry. LPS-treated MS PBMCs samples were thawed andwashed twice with staining buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS with 2 mMEDTA). Cells were resuspended in FcR-blocking buffer (1:100;Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and then incubated at4 °C for 10 min to block unspecific antibodies. After incubation withblocking buffer, cells were stained at 4 °C for 20 min with extracellularFigure 6. Determination of the immune modulatory effects.
