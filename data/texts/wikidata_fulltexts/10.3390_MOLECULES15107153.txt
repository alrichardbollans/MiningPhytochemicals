Abstract: Leaves and bark infusions Anacardium humile St. Hil. (Anacardiaceae), known 
as in Brazil as “cajuzinho do cerrado”, have been used in folk medicine as an alternative 
treatment for ulcers and gastritis. This study evaluated the gastroprotective activity of an 
ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of A. humile (AcF) and the mechanism involved in this 
gastroprotection. Pretreatment concentrations (50, 100, 200 mg.kg−1) were administered by 
gavage. Following a 60 min. period, all the rats were orally administered 1 mL of absolute 
ethanol. One hour after the administration of ethanol, all groups were sacrificed, and the 
gastric ulcer index was calculated. Prostaglandin PGE2 concentration, gastric adherent

mucous, and the participation of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfhydryl compounds in the 
gastroprotection process were also analyzed using the most effective tested dose  
(50 mg·kg−1). A histological study of the glandular stomach for the evaluation of the 
epithelial damage and mucus content was also performed. AcF significantly reduced the 
gastric damage produced by ethanol. This effect was statistically significant for the  
50 mg·kg−1 group compared to control. Also, it significantly increased the PGE2 (by 10-
fold) and mucous production, while pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-
NAME) or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) completely abolished the gastroprotection. AcF has a 
protective effect against ethanol, and this effect, might be due to the augmentation of the 
protective mechanisms of mucosa.

Introduction 
Numerous natural products derived from plant sources have been evaluated as therapeutics for the 
treatment of various diseases [1]. Among these diseases, peptic ulcers are a common disorder of the 
entire gastrointestinal tract that occur mainly in the stomach and the proximal duodenum. Despite great 
advances in the understanding of the peptic ulcer illness, its etiology has not been completely 
elucidated. The basic physiopathological concept is that the peptic ulcer results from an imbalance 
between some endogenous aggressive factor(s) [hydrochloric acid, pepsin, refluxed bile, leukotrienes, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS)] and cytoprotective factors, which include the function of the mucus-
bicarbonate barrier, surface active phospholipids, prostaglandins (PGs), mucosal blood flow, cell 
renewal and migration, nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants and some growth factors [2-5].  
Although recent advances in our understanding have highlighted the multi-factorial pathogenesis of 
peptic ulcers, secretion of gastric acid is still recognized as a central component of this disease. 
Therefore, the main therapeutic target is the control of this secretion using antacids, H2 receptor 
blockers (ranitidine, famotidine) or proton pump blockers (omeprazole and lansoprazole) [6]. 
However, nowadays gastric ulcer therapy faces a major drawback because most of the drugs currently 
available in the market show limited efficacy against gastric diseases and are often associated with 
severe side effects [7,8]. 
In this context, the use of medicinal plants for the prevention and treatment of different pathologies 
is in continuous expansion all over the world, including the subject of this research [9]. Natural 
products are gaining space and importance in the pharmaceutical industry as well as inspiring the 
search for new potential sources of bioactive molecules [10,11]. 
Anacardium humile St. Hil. (Anacardiaceae), popularly known as “cajuzinho do cerrado” or “cajuí” 
is a shrub (≅ 30 cm tall), with very long roots, small flowers, a greenish calyx and red petals with 
stripes. The leaves and bark infusions are used in folk medicine as anti-emetics and diuretics, and as 
treatments for ulcers, gastritis and diarrhea [12-14]. In this regard, Anacardium humile St. Hil. extracts 
have shown to possess antiulcerogenic activity [15].

The aim of this work was to evaluate the pharmacological role of this species, describing the 
mechanism involved in the gastroprotective action of the ethyl acetate extract (AcF) of leaves of 
Anacardium humile St. Hil. in order to justify whether the traditional use of this medicinal species for 
ulcer, gastritis or diarrhea is justified.  
Results and Discussion 
Historically, natural products have provided an endless source of alternative drugs to medicine. 
Plant-derived products have dominated the human pharmacopoeia for thousands of years almost 
unchallenged [16]. In Brazil, a large number of herbal extracts are used in folk medicine to treat 
various types of digestive disorders [17], including the specie Anacardium humile.  
The chromatographic profile of A. humile presented classes of compounds (Figures 1 and 2 and 
Table 1) which have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal ulcers [18], justifying the assessment of 
antiulcer activity and the mechanisms involved. 
Examination of the chromatograms shown in Figure 2A led to the recognition of three classes of 
secondary metabolites in AcF (Table 1): gallic acid derivatives, catechins and flavonoids (flavonoid 
glysosides and biflavonoid). Flavonoid glycosides were better detected at 360 nm (Figure 2B). 
Determination of each class was accomplished using HPLC analyses and external calibration.

The effect of ethyl acetate extract from Anacardium humile (AcF), on gastric ulcers induced by an 
irritant agent (absolute ethanol) was investigated in rats. Pre-treatment with AcF and lansoprazole were 
found to inhibit ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury. This inhibitory effect of AcF was the highest 
and statistically significant in the 50 mg·kg−1 group. The groups treated with 100 mg·kg−1 and  
200 mg·kg−1 of AcF, showed insignificant inhibitory effects for ethanol-induced gastric mucosal 
injury. Therefore, with the purpose of investigating the probable gastroprotective mechanisms 
involved in the action promoted by AcF, we studied only a dose of 50 mg.kg−1 for its efficacy. At the 
same time, 30 mg·kg−1 of lansoprazole significantly inhibited ethanol-induced gastric lesions 
compared to the control. The obtained results suggested that the ethyl acetate extract of A. humile 
posses a significant antiulcer effect in these ulcer-induced models.

EtOH-induced ulcers were not inhibited by antisecretory agents such as cimetidine, but are 
inhibited by agents that exhibit a gastroprotective action with an anti-oxidative cytoprotection [19]. 
Results of the present study showed that AcF (50 mg·kg−1) provided protection against gastric ulcers 
induced by ethanol (Table 2 and Figure 3C). Ethanol-induced ulceration is inhibited by agents that 
enhance mucosal defensive factor [19,20]. Since AcF enhanced mucosal defensive factors (PGE2 and 
mucus), this increase of the defensive factors promoted by the AcF may be, at least partially, one of 
the possible mechanisms by which AcF ameliorated the ethanol-induced gastric damage.

Aiming to investigate the probable gastroprotective mechanisms involved in the action promoted by 
this extract, we evaluated the role of AcF on PGE2 production. Pretreatment of rats with indomethacin

markedly reduced the gastric mucosal prostaglandin contents (Figure 4). On the other hand, 
pretreatment of rats with AcF (50 mg·kg−1) induced drastic increase of PGE2 levels as compared to rats 
treated only with Tween (P < 0.01).

Continuous generation of PGE2 by the mucosa is crucial for the maintenance of mucosal integrity 
and protection against ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents [21]. Almost all of the mucosal defense 
mechanisms are stimulated and/or facilitated by PGs. Our data suggest that the cytoprotective action of 
AcF on the gastric mucosa may be related to an increase in PGE2 production. PGs inhibit acid 
secretion, stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and 
accelerate epithelial restitution and mucosal healing [21]. 
We also observed the effect of AcF on adherent mucus production by the gastric mucosa (Figure 5). 
Pretreatment with AcF (50 mg.kg−1) and carbenoxolone (200 mg·kg−1) induced significant increase in 
mucoprotective effect in animals submitted to pylorus ligature.

Gastric mucus is an important protective factor for the gastric mucosa and consists of a viscous, 
elastic, adherent and transparent gel formed by water and glycoproteins that covers the entire 
gastrointestinal mucosa. The protective properties of the mucus barrier depend not only on the gel 
structure but also on the amount or thickness of the layer covering the mucosal surface [22]. In the 
present study, we also measured gastric adherent mucus and, the production was increased in AcF  
(50 mg·kg−1) (Figures 5 and 6C). Furthermore, our findings that AcF stimulated mucus secretion support 
the notion that this fraction acted by stimulating PGE2 production (Figure 7C). It has been previously 
reported that PGE2 stimulates mucus secretion [22]. The mucus layer protects the newly formed cells 
against damage caused by acid pH and the proteolytic potential of the gastric secretions [23].

Vascular changes in gastric mucosa appeared to be the most pronounced feature of absolute 
ethanol-induced injury [24]. As shown in Figure 7, pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester 
(L-NAME) (70 mg·kg−1, i.p.) attenuated the gastroprotection of both AcF (50 mg·kg−1) and 
carbenoxolone (100 mg·kg−1).

Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis or exogenously given NO has been repeatedly shown to protect the 
gastric mucosa against damage induced by various agents [25]. It has been reported that the serum and 
local NO levels are reduced in gastric injury models induced by ethanol and indomethacin, suggesting 
that the decrease in local NO content might be a key factor in facilitating gastric mucosal injury [26]. 
The previous administration of L-NAME, an NO-synthase inhibitor, altered the cytoprotection induced 
by AcF, suggesting that the anti-ulcer activity of this fraction is through the participation of 
endogenous nitric oxide. The role of NO in gastroprotection has been widely accepted [27]. An 
increase in NO levels by L-arginine (a substrate for NOS), but not D-arginine, has been shown to 
reduce absolute ethanol- induced gastric lesions [28]. 
It is well known that reduced glutathione GSH protects the gastric mucosa submitted to an 
ulcerative challenge [29]. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM, 10 mg·kg−1, s.c.)-pretreated rats produced a 
reduction in the gastroprotection exerted by the administration of AcF 50 mg·kg-1 on ethanol-induced 
gastric hemorrhagic lesions (Figure 8). A significant decrease in gastric GSH following ethanol 
administration indicated massive generation of free radicals [30]. Our result is in agreement with 
earlier reports showing depletion of sulfhydryls in ethanol-induced gastric lesions [31]. In this respect, 
the present increase of tissue damage, evoked by ethanol in the NEM pretreated rats, was expected 
because the treatment with glutathione depletors has been shown to significantly potentiate ulcerogen-
induced gastric mucosal injury [32], whereas an increase in mucosal NP-SH exerts a gastroprotective 
effect [33]. In this context, the antiulcerogenic activity of AcF (50 mg·kg−1) may depend on mucosal 
GSH levels, and it is likely that an increase of endogenous sulfhydryl compounds play an important 
role in the gastroprotective properties of this fraction.

Experimental 
Plant material, extraction and isolation 
A. humile St. Hil. was collected along Monte do Carmo road, in Porto Nacional in Tocantins state, 
Brazil in November 2002. The plants were identified by Marcos Alves and Eduardo Ribeiro of the 
University of Tocantins and a voucher specimen (accession number 1922) was deposited in the 
University of Tocantins Herbarium. 
Air-dried and powdered leaves (650 g) of A. humile St. Hil. were exhaustively extracted by 
successive maceration at room temperature with dichloromethane (DCM, 5 L) and methanol (MeOH, 
5 L) (130:1, w/v, one week for each solvent). Solvents were evaporated at 60 °C under reduced 
pressure to yield the DCM (6 g) and MeOH (193 g) extracts. A portion of the MeOH extract (80 g) was 
partitioned between a mixture of EtOAc/water (5 L, 1:1, v/v) to yield 3.4 g of EtOAc fraction (AcF) 
and 74 g of aqueous fraction (AqF). Flavonoids were detected in AcF as described elsewhere [34]. 
A portion (1 g) of the MeOH extract of A. humile St. Hil. was fractionated by gel permeation 
chromatography on a Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) column (5 cm × 100 cm) and eluted with MeOH 
(flow rate 0.5 mL·min−1). One hundred fractions (5 mL each) were collected and checked by Thin 
Layer Chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates eluted with a mixture of CHCl3/MeOH/n-PrOH/H2O 
(5:6:1:4; lower phase) and developed either with Natural Products - Polyethyleneglycol Reagent or 
with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid solution [34]. The fractions were subsequently combined and then 
purified by HPLC using a Knauer Chance system equipped with a Waters R401 refractive index 
detector, a Phenomenex Luna reverse-phase RP 18 column (25 cm × 1 cm × 10 μm) and a Rheodyne 
injector with a 100 μl sample loop. MeOH-H2O (8:2, v/v) was used as the eluent (flow rate  
2 mL·min-1). Fractions 64-72 (150 mg) yielded gallic acid (1, 50 mg) and methyl gallate (2, 75 mg); 
fractions 98-103 (75 mg) yielded (+)-catechin (3, 50 mg); fractions 119-124 (35 mg) yielded 
quercetin-3-O-β-D-allopyranoside (4, 5 mg) and quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (5, 8 mg); 
fractions 144–149 (35 mg) yielded quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranoside 
(rutin, 6, 8 mg); and fractions 178–200 (200 mg) yielded the biflavonoid amentoflavone (7, 165 mg) 
(Figure 1).  
The chemical identification of substances (1–7) was established by Nuclear magnetic resonance 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra in DMSO-d6 using a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer 
operated at 500 MHz for 1H and 150 MHz for 13C. The 2D analyses included 1H-1H-COSY (chemical 
shift correlation spectroscopy), inverse-detected 1H-13C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum 
coherence) and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity). All of the spectral data of the 
substances (1-7) were compared to those reported in the literature [35,36]. 
The chromatographic profile of AcF was obtained using an HPLC system (ProStar, Varian) 
equipped with a ProStar 330 photodiode-array ultraviolet detector (PDA), a Rheodyne injector  
(20 µL), a Phenomenex Luna RP-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d. 5 μm) and a RP-18 Phenomenex 
guard column (4 × 4.6 mm, i.d. 5 µm). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of water (A) and 
acetonitrile (B) (with 0.05% of trifluoroacetic acid) from 23 to 30% of B in 5 min, then from 30 to 
48% of B in 40 min and then from 48 to 100% of B in 65 min. Flow rate was 1.0 mL.min−1 and 
effluent was monitored at 210 nm and at 360 nm.

The determination of the concentration of the metabolites present in AcF was performed using 
external calibration. Flavonoids were expressed based on rutin, in the calibration range between  
5–500 µg·mL–1 (y = -4.81·105 + 1.91·105 x, R = 0.9999, N = 6); gallic acid derivatives were expressed 
based on gallic acid, in the calibration range between 2–200 µg·mL–1 (y = -9.69·104 + 2.38·105 ×,  
R = 0.9998, N = 9); catechins were expressed in terms of (+)-catechin, in the calibration range between 
1–70 µg·mL–1 (y = 1.40·105 + 8.93·105 x, R = 0.9999, N = 6). 
Animals  
Male Wistar rats (180–250 g) obtained from the breeding colony at the Universidade Estadual de 
Campinas (CEMIB/UNICAMP) were used. The animals were housed in a 12 h light/dark cycle, at a 
humidity of 60 ± 10% and a temperature of 21.5 ± 1.0 °C and were fed a certified Nuvilab CR-a® 
(Nuvital) diet, with free access to tap water. All experiments were carried out in the morning. The 
experimental protocols were all approved of by the Institutional Committee for Ethics in Animal 
Experimentation (no. 538-1, CEEA/IB/UNICAMP).  
Drugs 
Lansoprazole (Medley, Campinas, SP, Brazil), carbenoxolone and Tween 80® (Sigma Chemical 
Co., St. Louis, MO, USA.) were used in this study. The reagents for buffers and other solutions were 
all of analytical grade. All the other chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade. 
Ethanol-induced gastric lesion in rats  
After a total of 24 h fasting, three groups of rats (n = 5) received an oral administration of AcF (50, 
100, 200 mg·kg−1), lansoprazole (30 mg·kg−1) or vehicle (10 mL·kg−1). One hour after treatment, all 
rats received, orally, 1 mL of 99.5% ethanol to induce gastric ulcers [20]. The animals were killed by 
CO2 gas 1 h after treatment with the ulcerogenic agent and the stomachs removed to determine the 
gastric damage. The stomachs were removed, opened along the greater curvature and fixed between 
two glass plates. Ulcerative lesion was calculated according to the methodology described by Szelenyi 
and Thiemer [37]. 
Determination of prostaglandin PGE2 synthesis 
Thirty minutes after treatment with indomethacin (30 mg·kg−1), vehicle (10 mL·kg−1) or AcF  
(50 mg·kg−1), the rats were killed by CO2 gas and their abdomen opened. The control group without 
treatment experienced the same general conditions of the experimental groups. Samples of the corpus 
(full thickness) were excised, weighed and suspended in 1 mL of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 
7.4. After homogenizing with a Polytron® PT 10-35 homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Lucerne, 
Switzerland), the homogenate was incubated in a Dubnoff water-bath (Tecnal, Piracicaba, Brazil) at  
37 °C for 20 min and the amount of PGE2 in the buffer was measured by enzyme immunoassay using a 
commercial kit (RPN222, Amersham). The absorbance was read at 450 nm and the amount of PGE2 
expressed as pg/wet weight of tissue, was determined from a standard curve of PGE2 [38]. 
Molecules 2010, 15       
 
7163
Determination of mucus in gastric content 
After rats (n = 6–7) had fasted for 24 h, under anesthesia, the abdomen was incised and the pylorus 
ligated. The vehicle (Tween), carbenoxolone (200 mg·kg−1) or AcF (50 mg·kg−1) was administered 
orally after the pylorus ligature. The animals were killed by CO2 gas 4 h after the drug treatments. The 
stomach content was immersed in 10 mL 0.02% Alcian blue in 0.16 M sucrose/0.05 M sodium acetate, 
pH 5.8, and incubated for 24 h at 20 °C. The Alcian blue binding extract was centrifuged at 2000 × g 
for 10 min. The absorbance of supernatant was measured at 615 nm using a light spectrophotometer 
U/2000 (Hitachi, Japan). The free mucus in the gastric content was calculated from the amount of 
Alcian blue binding [mg/wt tissue (g)] [39]. 
Ethanol-induced gastric lesion in NEM and L-NAME- pretreatment rats 
Rats were divided into groups of 6–7 animals that fasted for 24 h. They had previously been treated 
intraperitoneally with NEM (N-ethylmaleimide, Sigma, USA) at a dose of 10 mg·kg−1, L-NAME (NG-
nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, Sigma, USA) at a dose of 70 mg·kg−1 or saline. Thirty minutes later, the 
groups received an oral dose of the vehicle, carbenoxolone (100 mg·kg−1) or AcF (50 mg·kg−1). After 
60 min, all groups were treated orally with 1 mL of absolute ethanol for gastric-ulcer induction [40]. 
Animals were killed by CO2 gas 1 h after ethanol administration and the stomachs excised and gastric 
damage determined as described above. 
Histology of ethanol-induced gastric lesions 
The stomach of the rats submitted to gastric ulcers in the ethanol model with different treatments 
(control, carbenoxolone and AcF) were pushed off and opened by the large curvature and the lesion 
was localized. The lesion was sectioned, and one sample was fixed in ALFAC solution (alcohol, 
chloroform and acetic acid) for 24 h in 4 °C. The samples were routinely processed for embedding in 
paraplast, and cut into 7 µm thick section. These sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin [41] 
and periodic acid –Schiff (PAS) [42]. The samples were analysed with a Leica microscope associated 
with Leica Qwin Software (Leica-England).  
Statistical analysis  
The results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance among groups was assessed 
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey tests, with p ≤ 0.05 indicating 
significance. All statistical analyses were done using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, 
USA). 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, only a limited number of studies have reported the biological effects of Anacardium 
humile St. Hil., which has made it difficult to find references, including those describing anti-
ulcerogenic activity, first reported by our research group in a previous study. The present investigation 
attempted to evaluate in more depth the anti-ulcerogenic mechanism of the ethyl acetate extract of this

plant. The gastroprotective mechanism is based on its ability to strengthen defensive factors by 
elevating mucus and PGE2 levels with participation of NO and SH groups to prevent or attenuate the 
ulcer process. Therefore, the results obtained from the administration of AcF of Anacardium humile 
under in vivo models support the ethnopharmacological use of this species.
