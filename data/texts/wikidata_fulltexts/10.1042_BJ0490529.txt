Vol. 49 LACTIC ACID IN SILAGE 529
RESULTS
The silage specimens on which data are reported were
from grass and grass-clover mixtures ensiled during
the summer of 1950 on various farms in the north-
east of Scotland, and were taken at random from
specimens being analysed here.
It is seen from Fig. 2 that the lactic acid content of
silage falls rapidly with rise ofpH. This is in accord-
ance with the generally held view that in silage of
pH greater than 4-2 the amounts of lactic acid are
small. It has not been definitely shown, however,
whether or not lactic acid is formed in all silage but
is subsequently destroyed in silage of high pH. An
investigation into this problem is the subject of
further work.
SUMMARY
The use of the procedure of Barker & Summerson
(1941) for determining lactic acid is described in its
relation to the estimation of this acid in silage.
It is desired to thank Mr John Baxter for his assistance
in the technical side of the present work.

Transfructosidation in Extracts of the Tubers
of Helianthus tuberosus L.
BY J. EDELMAN* AD J. S. D. BACON
Department of Biochemi8try, The University, Sheffield 10
(Received 27 February 1951)
In the artichoke tuber there is present a mixture of
carbohydrates, of which sucrose is the component
with smallest molecular weight, and inulin probably
the largest (Bacon & Edelman, 1951). Since the only
enzyme system which is known to produce a fructose
polysaccharide in vitro (levansucrase; Hestrin,
Avineri-Shapiro & Aschner, 1943) does so from
sucrose, it seemed worth while to investigate the
possibility that inulin was formed from sucrose, and
with this aim in view the action of tuber extracts
on sucrose was studied.
The results presented in this paper show that a
reaction takes place in tuber extracts by which
oligosaccharides are synthesized from sucrose at the
expense of fructose residues from inulin and related
polysaccharides. The name 'transfructosidation' is
proposed for this type of reaction. A preliminary
account was given to the Biochemical Society at
Edinburgh on 21 July 1950 (Edelman & Bacon,
1950).
METHODS
The methods were those described by Bacon & Edelman
(1951) and Edelman & Bacon (1951).
Dandelion inulin (Thomas Kerfoot and Co. Ltd., Vale of
Bardsley, Ashton-under-Lyne) was purified as described
by Edelman & Bacon (1951). Sucrose was recrystallized
one or more times from 95% aqueous ethanol. Both
carbohydrates were shown by paper partition chromato-
graphy to be free from other oligosaccharides and free
hexoses.
All incubations were carried out in the presence of CHC13
unless otherwise stated.
RESULTS
Initial investigation
Qualitative experiments. It was assumed that any
synthetic activity in the presence of sucrose would
lead first to the production of oligosaccharides
behaving, on the paper partition chromatogram,
like spots 2, 3 and so on (Bacon & Edelmnan, 1951).
Since these substances were already present in the
tubers, dialysis was carried out to remove them.

Mash, prepared in November 1949, was dialysed
against running cold water for 50 hr., the dialysis
sac being periodically agitated by a rocking move-
ment. Two 25 ml. samples of the dialysed material
were adjusted to pH values of 5 0 and about 6*5 with
1 ml. x-sodium acetate buffer and drops of 0-2N-
sodium hydroxide respectively. Samples (10 ml.) of
these preparations were each incubated at 280 with
1 ml. 50% sucrose. Other samples were incubated
without added sucrose. Chromatograms of 20 and
45 hr. incubation samples containing added sucrose
showed, at bothpH values, a spot in position 2 of the
artichoke carbohydrate series. The higher pH value
gave a rather more pronounced effect as judged
qualitatively. Spot 2 did not appear in the controls.
Although free glucose and fructose appeared in
rather greater amount in the samples incubated with
sucrose than in the controls, only small amounts of
these sugars were formed. Further experiments,
similar to the one described, confirmed that spot 2
appeared in the presence of sucrose, but not in its
absence, and showed that it was formed in greater
amount at pH values 5-8 and 6-4 than at 4-2 and 7-2.
Boiled extract in the presence of sucrose did not
give the reaction. Some of the incubated samples
in these experiments contained only traces of mono-
saccharide, although considerable amounts of spot 2
had been formed (see Fig. 1).
Quantitative experiment8. The effect was studied in
undialysed mash by developing the use of quanti-
tative paper partition chromatography to follow
changes in the amounts of the oligosaccharide
components. Two samples of 25 g. mash were
incubated at 280 with 2-5 ml. 33% sucrose and
2-5 ml. water respectively. No pH adjustment was
made. Samples of the liquid strained from the
incubated mash through gauze were chromato-
graphed in butanol-acetic acid and the ketose
content of the spots estimated. Results are given
in Table 1.
A micrometer syringe was not used in applying
the 5 ul. samples of liquid to the filter paper in this
experiment; a 0-1 ml. graduated pipette was used
instead, with consequent loss in accuracy. In spite
of this, however, the table shows that there were no
major changes in any of the control incubations
except in spot F (free fructose) and spots 5 to n.
Spots 2 and 3 in the sample incubated with sucrose,
however, showed a very marked increase, and there
was a smaller but probably significant increase in
spot 4. Spot 1 (sucrose) decreased. Fructose was
liberated in similar amounts in both samples. A
discrepancy was noticed, namely that whereas the
overall increase in spots 2-4 was 261 ug. fructose/
20 ,ul., the disappearance of fructose from spot 1
(sucrose) was only 144 ,g./20 ,u. It did not seem
possible that such a large difference could be caused
by experimental error.

TRANSFRUCTOSIDATION IN ARTICHOKE EXTRACTS
No glucose could be detected qualitatively in this
experiment in spite of the sensitivity of the spray-
ing reagent used (benzidine-trichloroacetic) which
would have detected as little as 5 pg. glucose/20pl.
under the conditions used. A similar experiment to
the one described, in which the presence of free
glucose was investigated qualitatively and quantita-
tively, confirmed this result. Although the estima-
tions of glucose were not very satisfactory (cf.
Bacon & Edelman, 1951), it appeared from these and
fromthe qualitativeresultsthatdismutation between
sucrose molecules according to the equation
2 (glucose-fructose) -+ glucose-(fructose)2 + glucose
could not account for the observations.

Elimination of extraneous cau8es. At this stage it
was thought advisable to eliminate the possibility
that the effects observed were due to contaminating
bacteria, or to purely physical effects on the paper
chromatogram.
(a) Bacterial contamination. In order to eliminate
a heavy initial inoculum of micro-organisms tubers
were scrubbed thoroughly with water and then with
soap and water. They were peeled, washed with
water, then with 70 % ethanol, and the surface
layers removed again. The remaining material was
extracted in the usual way, chloroform being added
at the start of disintegration in the Waring blender.
Sucrose solutions saturated with chloroform were
made up immediately before the tubers were ex-
tracted. Incubation was started a few minutes after
the preparation of the extracts and stopped 2-5
or 5 hr. (Table 2) later. Chloroform was present
throughout the incubations. A significant increase in
spot 2 occurred in both cases. It is unlikely that
bacteria caused the effect under these conditions
during so short a period of incubation.
Earth chipped from the same batch of tubers was
incubated at 370 with 7 % sucrose in 0-004M-
ammonium chloride. No material with Rp lower
than sucrose was detected even after incubation for
52 hr. in the absence of chloroform. Traces of free
glucose and fructose appeared underthese conditions,
but were not formed in the presence of chloroform.

All extracts used subsequently were made from
peeled tubers washed thoroughly in water.
(b) Physical interference on chromatograms. The
increase in spots 2-4 was not due to a physical effect
of large amounts of sucrose on the chromatographic
separation. Zero hour samples showed no significant
differences from the controls (see Tables 2, 4, 8 and
9), boiled extract showed no increase of spot 2 in the
presence of added sucrose (Table 3), and during the
reaction there was a progressive increase of spot 2
with time of incubation (see below).

Effect of dialysis. Dialysis reduced the activity
considerably, but did not destroy it entirely. This
effect, first noticed qualitatively, is shown in Table 4,
which shows also that dialysis for 53 hr. did not
eliminate all the polysaccharide in the extract, the
lower spots in the case of the dialysed extract
incubated without sucrose probably being formed by
the action of the hydrolytic system on the residual
polysaccharide.
As compared with spot 2 glucose was formed in
significant amounts in the presence of sucrose.
However, not all dialysed extracts produced free
glucose under these conditions.

Addition of boiled undialysed extract completely
restored the activity. Two separate dialyses of the
same extract were carried out for 9 and 22 hr.
respectively against running water at 90. Glass
tubes containing undialysed extract were suspended
in the running water for these periods. The dialysed
extract increased in volume from 40 to 46 ml. (9 hr.)
andfrom40to 49 ml. (22 hr.). Theundialysedsamples
were diluted similarly. A sample (10 ml.) of each of
the four extracts was placed in a boiling-water bath
for 5 min. and then cooled. Five incubates were set
up: (1) undialysed extract (2-5 ml.) + boiled dialysed
extract (2.5 ml.) (9 hr. dialysis); (2) boiledundialysed
extract (2-5 ml.) + dialysed extract (2.5 ml.) (9 hr.
dialysis). Incubates 3 and 4 were set up, similarly
to 1 and 2 but using the 22 hr. dialysed samples.
Incubate 5 contained 2-5 ml. undialysed extract+
2-5 ml. boiled undialysed extract. To each incubate
was added 1-0 nl. 30% sucrose solution to give an
overall concentration of added sucrose of 5 %. The
results of analysis of the various components after
22 hr. incubation at 30°, given in Table 5, show that
dialysed extract in the presence of boiled extract
had the same activity as undialysed extract.
Attempt to concentrate the enzymic activity. An
extract,- prepared January 1950 (pH adjusted to 7
with x-sodiumhydroxide), was fractionated between
zerco and 0-25, and 0-25 and 0-50ammonium sulphate

which formed were separated by centrifugation.

Aqueous suspensions of these precipitates were
dialysed overnight against running water and
incubated at 280 with an overall concentration of
25% added sucrose at pH values of 6-8 (in 0-lIm-
phosphate buffer) and 5-0 (in Olm-acetate buffer).
Samples taken at zero time showed no carbohydrate
material on the chromatogram other than sucrose.
In the case of the 0-25-0-50 saturation precipitate,
later samples (5, 10, 28 and 53 hr.) showed traces of
spot 2, glucose, and fructose, all becoming pro-
gressively more distinct in the course of-time. These
spots were weaker in the pH 5-0 incubate. The
incubate containing the zero to 0-25 saturation
precipitate showed only the slightest traces of these
additional spots, and their appearance was delayed
as compared with the 0-25-0-50 saturation pre-
cipitate. Even the greatest activity shown in this
experiment, however, was negligibly small when
compared with that of fresh tuber extracts. Further
ammonium sulphate precipitates obtained between
0and 0-60saturationshowedno detectable formation
of spot 2 when incubated with sucrose, but their
activity could be restored by adding boiled fresh
extract. Such a precipitate, obtained from 300 ml.
fresh ext'act, was taken up in water to give 15 ml.,
and this solution diilysed for 20 hr. against running
-cold water. To 4-0 ml. boiled fresh extract were
added 0'8 ml. 30% sucrose solution and 1-0 ml. of
this dialysed preparation, and to 4-0 ml. unboiled
extract were added 0-8 ml. 30% sucrose and 1-0 ml.

water. The mixtures were incubated at 30°. Results
of analyses are given in Table 6; they showed that
under these conditions the ammonium sulphate
precipitate contained considerable activity. These
experiments and those described above suggested
that a thermostable co-factor was present in active
preparations.
As the active system in tuber extracts could not
be separated from the carbohydrates by dialysis or
ammonium sulphate precipitation, further investi-
gation was, ofnecessity, carried out on fresh extracts.
Further inve8tigation8 offresh extracts
Effect of varying pH on the reaction. The optimum
lay between pH values 6*0 and 6*5 (see Table 7).
As thepH offresh extracts was in the neighbourhood
of 6*5 no buffer was added in subsequent experiments.
Progrews of the reaction with time. This is shown
in Table 8. The following points were noticed:
(1) Fructose is liberated in similar amounts both in
the presence and absence ofadded sucrose. Although
no figures were obtained for free glucose, this sugar
was present in traces only (less than 5 ,ug./20 ml.
incubate) and did not increase noticeably either in

of spot 2 are represented by jug. ketose/20p1.; the initial

(3) Theketose content ofspot 2 increased throughout
the time of incubation, very much more in the
incubate with added sucrose than in the control.
(4) There was no difference between the rates of
increase of the ketose contents of spot 3 in the two
incubates. (5) There was some indication that the
ketose content of spots 4 to n was decreasing more
rapidly in the presence of added sucrose than in the
control. (The fluctuation of the ketose content of
this group of spots was much larger in absolute
terms than that of the lower spots because much
larger total amounts were being estimated; measure-
ment of the decrease, which was of the same order
as the change in spot 1, was therefore subject to a
much larger experimental error.) (6) The amount of
combined fructose which disappeared from spot 1
approximated fairly closely to half the fructose
appearing in spots 2 and 3 together.
From (5) and (6) above, the possibility was
suggested that the material causing the increase in
spots 2 and 3 was derived partly from spot 1 and
partly from higher spots.
Effect of varying 8ucro8e concentration. The effect
of varying concentrations of sucrose on the reaction
was therefore investigated in an attempt to establish
a more reliable quantitative relationship between
the changes in ketose content of the various com-
ponents of the system. The results of such an experi-
ment are given in Table 9, which shows good agree-
ment between the total ketose estimated before
and after incubation, the greatest discrepancy being
about 3% and the average 1 %. Fructose was
liberated in similar amounts at all levels of added
sucrose, there being a slight decrease with increasing
concentration of added sucrose at the higher levels.
The increase in ketose content of spot 3 was also
similar at all levels of added sucrose concentration
except the two highest. These variations in spots F
and 3 are sufficiently small to have little effect on the
calculations of the changes in spots 1, 2 and 4 to n,
in making which it has been assumed that the ketose
appearing in spots F and 3 was derived ultimately
from spots 4to n. In the table, therefore, all material
higher than spot 2 has been treated as a single entity,
namely spots 3 to n.
When the amount of spotF is added to the values
for spots 3 to n there remains still a significant
amount of ketose to be accounted for (Table 9 b, iii),
an amount increasing with increasing sucrose con-
centration, and approximately equal to the corre-
spondingdecrease in spot 1 (Table 9 b, iv, v). It should
be noted that small percentage errors in analysis
would cause very large errors in the ratios given in
(v), particularly at the extremes of sucrose con-
centration, since with no added sucrose the error in
measuring spots 3 to n is large in comparison with
Table 9. Effect of varying ucroe concentration on the reaction

the increase in spot 2, and with high concentrations
of sucrose the absolute errors in measuring the
ketose contents of both spots 1 and 3 to n become
considerable. Thus, an error of 5% in the estimation
of spot 1 in the samples containing no added sucrose
could cause an error in this ratio of about 55 %,
whilst a similar error in estimation of the sample
containing the highest level of added sucrose could
cause an error of about 100 %.
If the results with these two samples are ignored,
decrease in spots 3 to nthe average value of the ratio decrease in spot 1decrease in spot 1
is 1-01.
These results confirmed the previous assumption
that the material appearing as spot 2 was derived
both from sucrose and from the polysaccharide
material contained in spots 4 to n (Table 9b, vi, vii
and viii). A hypothesis in accordance with the facts
presented is that fructose residues are transferred
from polysaccharide to sucrose molecules, forming
a trisaccharide in the first instance:
(fructose),, + glucose-fructose
-* (fructose).-, + glucose-(fructose)2.
Further fructose residues might then be transferred
to the trisaccharide, yielding a tetrasaccharide, and
so on.
Action on mixture,s of inulin and sucro8e
Preparation of active concentrate8. According to
the above hypothesis, systems not containing a
fructose donor (i.e. polysaccharide) would not show
the reaction, which would explain why no significant
amounts of oligosaccharide had been produced
when ammonium sulphate precipitates were in-
cubated with $ucrose alone. The traces sometimes
formed under such conditions may have been due
to the presence of a small amount of undialysable
polysaccharide from the original extract.
Confirmatory evidence in support of the hypo-
thesis was obtained by an experiment in which a
mixture of sucrose and inulin was incubated with an
ammonium sulphate fraction (prepared between
0-25 and 0-55 saturation). Spot 2 was formed; when
the enzyme preparation was incubated with inulin
alone, or sucrose alone, it was not (see Fig. 2).
The preparation used in this experiment had been
concentrated with respect to its hydrolytic activity
(see Edelman & Bacon, 1951), and its transferring
activity was fairly weak. It was found that addition
of ammonium sulphate to 0-60 saturation in fresh
extracts precipitated material which, when taken up
in a small volume of water and dialysed, showed
rather higher activity as judged qualitatively in
systems containing inulin and sucrose. In later
experiments spots 2 and 3 and traces of higher spots
were produced in such systems. Although the
reaction was usually carried out in the presence of
L]N ARTICHOKE EXTRACTS 535
about 0-02M-phosphate buffer (pH 6-5) inorganic
phosphate did not appear to be necessary for the
production of the higher spots. Similar systems set
up in the presence and absence of phosphate buffer
showed no difference in activity as judged
qualitatively.

precipitate of material which had not redissolved
during dialysis. The clear supematant liquid con.
tained the transferring activity but very little
sucrose-hydrolysing activity, most of which was
contained in the precipitate. For example: an
enzyme preparation, prepared June 1950, was
dialysed for 18 hr. against running cold water. Part
of the dialysate (7.0 ml.) was centrifuged at high
speed for 10 min. The clear yellow supernatant

and made up to 7-0 ml. These two preparations were
incubated in a solution containing 2-5% inulin and
S% sucrose, and in a solution of 5% sucrose alone.
Similar incubations were carried out using the
original dialysed preparation. The incubates con-
tained 0-02M-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The results
are given in Table 10, and indicated that the trans-
ferring system and part of the monosaccharide

graphically no differences after incubation (up to
30 hr.) from control incubations with these sugars
in the absence ofinulin. The incubations were carried
out in 0-02M-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). There was
some lactase and maltase activity and a con-
siderable trehalase activity as judged qualitatively.
However, in a similar experiment using raffinose
(7-5 %), there appeared after 5 hr. a spot with B.
smaller than that of raffinose, and with approxi-
mately the same intensity as spot 2 formed during
a parallel incubation with sucrose of about the same
molar concentration (0-15m, i.e. 5 %, w/v). On
continued incubation (30 hr.) a further spot, with
still smaller R,, appeared. (Enzyme preparations
after centrifugation still contained some melibiase
activity, although the invertase activity had been
eliminated.)
Experiments with melezitose (kindly supplied by
Dr C. S. Hudson of Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.)
also gave positive results. Incubates containing
enzyme preparation (1 vol. in 3), 5% inulin and 5%
melezitose in 0-02M-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5)
showed, after 18 hr. at 300, a spot with R. smaller
than that of melezitose on chromatograms run in
butanol-acetic or phenol. Incubation in the absence
ofinulin showed no such spot; the melezitose was not
hydrolysed.
Replaement of inulin by other polysaccharide8.
Various polysaccharides were incubated with the
enzyme (uncentrifuged; 1 vol. in 3) and sucrose
(5%). The incubations were carried out in 0-02M-
phosphate buffer (pH 6.5).
Spots appeared with R. smaller than that of
sucrose with both starch and glycogen, but these
spots also appeared in the controls incubated
.without sucrose. In the case of glycogen the spot
immediately above sucrose (presumably maltose)
was stronger in the control, and there was a series
ofweaker spots extending as a streak to the starting
line both in the presence and absence of sucrose.
These spots (reducing dextrins?) all gave the reddish
colour typical of maltose with the benzidine-
trichloroacetic spraying reagent. Small amounts of
glucosewere liberateafromboth starch and glycogen.
A grass levan (kindly supplied by Dr D. J. Bell)
showed no spots other than those of the carbo-
hydrates added, either in the presence or absence
of sucrose. Irisin 'B' (dialysed before use) showed
a trace ofa spot in position '2' after 30 hr. incubation
in the presence of sucrose. The spot did not appear in
the absence of sucrose.
DISCUSSION
The experiments described show the presence in
extracts of artichoke tubers of an enzyme system
which catalyses the transference of fructose residues
from inulin and associated polysaccharides to
sucrose. No evidence, however, is available to show
538 I95I
TRANSFRUCTOSIDATION IN ARTICHOKE EXTRACTS
how small the polysaccharide donor or how large
the oligosaccharide acceptor may be; it is not
excluded that relatively small molecules may take
either part in the reaction, although sucrose does not
donate fructose to sucrose to anyappreciable extent.
The latter observation calls attention to the
similarities in specificity (as far as this has been
tested) between the hydrolytic enzyme system
described previously (Edelman & Bacon, 1951) and
the donor side of the transfructosidation system.
The specificity of the acceptor side of the transfer
reaction is low, requiring only a fructose residue,
free or combined. (One acceptor, melezitose, is not
attacked hydrolytically by the enzyme preparation
studied.)
The question therefore arises whether the same
enzyme is responsible for both the hydrolytic and
the group-transfer reactions. Such a view might
receive support from recent observations on other
enzymes attacking hydrolysable substrates. For
example, Rabat6 (1935, 1937) described transglyco-
sidation in plant extracts which were capable of
hydrolysing certain heterosides; Axelrod (1948a, b)
and Appleyard (1948) described tranaphosphoryla-
tion catalysed by acid phosphatase preparations;
and Fruton (1950; Johnston, Mycek & Fruton,
1950) described a transpeptidation reaction with
cysteine-activated papain. Fruton (1950) suggested
a mechanism to account for his observations,, and
remarked 'it will be important to examine the
possibility that some of the enzymes considered to
function solely as catalysts in hydrolytic reactions
may have an important physiological role in the
catalysis of replacement reactions' (Johnston et al.
1950). This view was further borne out by the
observation ofMeyerhof & Green (1950) that alkaline
phosphatase would catalyse transphosphorylation
reactions, and those of Blanchard & Albon (1950)
and Bacon & Edelman (1950) that yeast invertase
preparations formed substances presumed to be
trisaccharides during their hydrolytic action on
sucrose.
If one assumes that such dual activities are the
property of a single enzyme it may be postulated
that the primary action of the enzyme is to combine
with the substrate, which may be represented as
A-B. Three (or perhaps more) possibilities then
present themselves: (1) that the elements of water
may combine with the substrate, so that hydrolysis
takes place, (2) that B (and less probably A as well)
may be exchanged for a substance ofsimilar structure
(C) yielding the compound A-C, (3) that B may be
exchanged with a phosphate radical, the substance
A-phosphate being formed.
In the case of acid phosphatases only the alcohol
or phenol moiety is exchangeable, and water may
take its place. With sucrose phosphorylase only the
fructose residue is exchangeable, either by other
sugars (L-sorbose, D-xyloketose, L-arabinose), or by
phosphate, butnotbywater (cf. Hassid& Doudoroff,
1950). All three reactions may be regarded equally
as group-transfer reactions: to water, to an organic
acceptor, or to phosphate, respectively.
Wholly hydrolytic enzymes and wholly trans-
ferring enzymes would on this assumption represent
merely the extremes of a general type. In the case
of certain enzymes that attack sucrose one may
discern a gradation extending from yeast invertase,
which shows relatively slight transferring activity,
through the mould invertases, which show appreci-
able transfer (Edelman, Bacon & Bealing, 1950),
to levansucrase (Hestrin et al. 1943; Hestrin &
Avineri-Shapiro, 1944) which produces a poly-
saccharide and only very little free fructose.
Changes in pH might alter the ratio of the hydro-
lytic to group-transfer activities even if these were
the property of a single enzyme. Thus Johnston
et al. (1950) found that at a higher pH transpeptida-
tion was increased relative to hydrolysis. Axelrod
(1948a), however, found little difference in the pH
optima for the two activities of his orange juice
phosphatase preparation. In artichoke tuber extract
the pH optimum of transfructosidation is higher
than that for hydrolysis of the tuber carbohydrates.
A consequence of (1) and (2) is that there should be
competition between water and the other acceptors
in the system. Since the concentration of water is
already at its maximum in an aqueous medium,
increase in the absolute concentration of another
acceptor wouldmean an increase in its concentration
relative to that of water. This is consistent with the
increase in transfructosidation with increasing
sucrose concentration shown in Table 9, and might
explain the high molar concentrations apparently
needed for maximum transfer, which has not so far
been achieved in our experiments.
Whether the rate of hydrolysis should alter in the
presence of acceptors other than water cannot be
predicted. It is conceivable that hydrolysis might
be reduced by the presence of an acceptor (cf.
orange juice phosphatase/methanol/methyl phos-
phate system, Axelrod, 1948a; also Rabat6,
1937) or increased if the product of group-transfer
were more readily hydrolysed (cf. prostatic acid
phosphatase/i8opropanol/phenolphthaleinphosphate
system, Appleyard, 1948). The latter possibility
recalls the earlier observations of Behrens & Berg-
mann (1939) on the 'co-substrate' effect of certain
peptides with proteolytic enzymes. The fact that
the liberation of free fructose does not alter much
with a fivefold increase in acceptor concentration
and a tenfold increase in the rate of transfructosida-
tion thus cannot be taken as evidence that the two
systems are independent.
From these considerations it follows that the
question of the identity of the hydrolytic and
539
540 J. EDELMAN AND J. S. D. BACON I95I
fructose-transferring enzyme system ofthe artichoke
tuber remains an open one. However, the existence
of a transfructosidation reaction lends further
support to the view that the structures of all the
components of the tuber carbohydrates are based
upon that of sucrose (Bacon & Edelman, 1951; cf.
also Bell, 1947).
SUMMARY
1. From artichoke tubers enzyme preparations
have been obtained which catalyse the transference
of fructose residues from inulin and associated
polysaccharides to sucrose, thereby forming a
trisaccharide and higher oligosaccharides.
2. Evidence has also been obtained for the
transference of fructose residues to raffinose,
melezitose, and to free fructose, but not to maltose,
lactose, trehalose or glucose.
3. The liberation of free hexose which took place
in all the preparations examined does not appear
to be connected quantitatively with the group-
transfer reaction.
4. The reaction, for -which the name 'trans-
fructosidation' is proposed, is discussed in the light
of existing knowledge of hydrolytic and group-
transferring enzyme systems.
Note added 22 June 1951. Since this paper was sub-
mitted our attention has been drawn to the work of
Dedonder (1950, 1951), from which he drew independently
conclusions similar to our own about the nature of the
artichoke fructosans, and suggested that phosphate was
necessary for their synthesis from sucrose.
This work was done with the technical assistance of
Mr R. Loxley. We wish to thank Dr K. Burton and Prof.
H. A. Krebs, F.R.S., for discussions of the wider significance
of our results; and Dr C. S. Hudson for gifts of melezitose
and turanose. One of us (J.E.) is indebted to the Agri-
cultural Research Council for grants during the course of
the research.

The Construction of a Counter-current Apparatus
BY G. H. LATHE AND C. R. J. RUTHVEN
The Bernhard Baron Memorial Re8earch Laboratories, Queen Charlotte'8 Maternity Ho8pital,

(Received 11 January 1951)
The introduction of an apparatus for counter-
current extraction by Craig (1944) was a notable
contribution to the separation of a wide variety of
compounds. Recently Craig (1950) has devised a
glass apparatus of large capacity.
In applying the counter-current principle to the
separation of lipids it has been found necessary to
design a new apparatus in which the fluid phases
could easily be examined for emulsions and removed
for centrifuging, if necessary. It was desirable that
the instrument be suitable for both large and small
volumes of fluid. These characteristics have been
embodied in an apparatus of glass and plastic with
49 'theoretical plates'. Its simplicity, and low cost,
would seem to adapt it to general laboratory use.
General de8cription of apparatus
The apparatus (Figs. 1, 2) consists ofan array of 50
pairs of vertical wide glass tubes with conical ends
supported by 'Terry' clips on either side ofa wooden
frame. The lower ends of each pair are joined by
narrow polythene tubing, and neighbouring pairs
are joined at the upper ends by wide polythene
tubing, the whole forming a continuous spiral around
