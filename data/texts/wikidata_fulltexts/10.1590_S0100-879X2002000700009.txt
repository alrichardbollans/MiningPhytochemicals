Grynberg1,M.G. Carvalho1,J.R. Velandia1,M.C. Oliveira1,I.C. Moreira1, R. Braz-Filho2and A. Echevarria1AbstractTopoisomerase inhibitors are agents with anticancer activity. 7"-O-Methyl-agathisflavone (I) and amentoflavone (II) are biflavonoids andwere isolated from the Brazilian plants Ouratea hexasperma and O.semiserrata, respectively. These biflavonoids and the acetyl deriva-tive of II (IIa) are inhibitors of human DNA topoisomerases I at 200µM, as demonstrated by the relaxation assay of supercoiled DNA, andonly agathisflavone (I) at 200 µM also inhibited DNA topoisomerasesII-α, as observed by decatenation and relaxation assays. Thebiflavonoids showed concentration-dependent growth inhibitory ac-tivities on Ehrlich carcinoma cells in 45-h culture, assayed by atetrazolium method, with IC50 = 24 ± 1.4 µM for I, 26 ± 1.1 µM for IIand 10 ± 0.7 µM for IIa. These biflavonoids were assayed againsthuman K562 leukemia cells in 45-h culture, but only I showed 42%growth inhibitory activity at 90 µM. Our results suggest thatbiflavonoids are targets for DNA topoisomerases and their cytotoxic-ity is dependent on tumor cell type.CorrespondenceN.F.

DNAtopoisomerases are enzymes that modulatethe topological state of DNA. There are twoclasses of topoisomerases: type I acts bytransiently nicking one of the two DNAstrands and type II nicks both DNA strandsand is ATP dependent (1). Interest in theseenzymes has increased in the last few yearsbecause they are targets for many drugs ef-fective in cancer treatment. Interestingly, fla-vonoids ubiquitously occurring in greenplants have inhibitory activity on a variety ofenzymes including topoisomerases (2) andare useful for the treatment of various dis-eases. For example, Ginkgo biloba contain-ing flavonoids and terpenoids is used to pre-vent coronary disease and cancer (2), andseveral Leguminosae plants containing iso-flavonoids have estrogenic activities.The interest of our group in studying thechemical constituents of Brazilian plants ledus to isolate biflavonoids from the Ochnaceaefamily. This family is pantropical and has thehighest density of genera and species in thetropical zones of South America. The Ourateagenus has been characterized as a good sourceof biflavonoids (3,4).In the present study, we describe the ef-fect of the biflavonoids 7"-O-methyl-aga-thisflavone (biflavonoid I), isolated fromBrazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research (2002) 35:  819-822ISSN 0100-879X Short Communication820Braz J Med Biol Res 35(7) 2002N.F. Grynberg et al.Ouratea hexasperma Bail (St. Hill) collectedin Amapá, Brazil, and amentoflavone (bifla-vonoid II) obtained from O. semiserrata Mart(Engl.) collected in Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil,and the acetyl derivative of II (biflavonoidIIa) on Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma cells, hu-man K562 leukemia cells (5) and action onthe human DNA topoisomerases I and II-α.Biflavonoids I and II, 7"-O-methyl-aga-thisflavone [1,4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone-(6→8")-4"',5"-dihydroxy-7"-methoxyflavone]and amentoflavone [2,4',5,7-trihydroxy-flavone-(3→8")-4"',5",7"-trihydroxyflavone],respectively, were isolated from a metha-nolic extract of the leaves using chromato-graphic techniques, and II was also acety-lated with acetic anhydride in the presenceof pyridine to yield IIa. The structures of thenatural products (biflavonoids I and II) wereestablished on the basis of 1-D and 2-DNMR, MS, IR and UV spectral data, includ-ing results obtained for the acetyl derivativeIIa (3,4).The antiproliferative activities of bifla-vonoids were assayed in vitro against mu-rine Ehrlich carcinoma (1 x 105 cells) andhuman K562 leukemia (1 x 104 cells) inRPMI complete medium (supplemented with5% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycinand 100 IU/ml penicillin), and were seededonto 96-well microplates. The compoundsin 0.3% (v/v) DMSO were prepared at con-centrations of 200, 100, 50 and 25 µM, andwere added to cells and incubated for 48 h at37ºC in the presence of 5% CO2 (6). Thesame volume of DMSO was used as control.Cell viability was assayed in the absence orpresence of I, II, and IIa, quercetin and eto-poside (the last two as positive control),using the Mossman assay (7). After 45 h ofcell culture, MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,4-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] wasadded to the samples and absorbance wasmeasured at 570 nm after 3 h at 37ºC. TheIC50 values (µM) were reported as means ±SD of three experiments.The biflavonoids presented concentra-tion-dependent growth inhibiting activitieson cultured Ehrlich carcinoma cells. TheIC50 values were 24 ± 1.4, 26 ± 1.1 and 10 ±0.7 µM for I, II and IIa, respectively, com-pared with 38 ± 1.4 µM for etoposide, apowerful anticancer agent. Furthermore, theadditional inhibitory effect 10 ± 0.7 vs 26 ±1.1 µM of the biflavonoid acetylated on thehydroxy groups (IIa) may be related to thepresence of a more lipophilic moiety (acetylester vs hydroxyl group) than II. This lipo-philic compound could probably cross thecell membrane, providing better inhibitionof Ehrlich carcinoma cells. During 45 h ofexposure of K562 leukemia cells to allbiflavonoids assayed, only marginal activitywas obtained for I with 42% of growth inhi-bition at 90 µM. No cytotoxicity was ob-served with etoposide under these condi-tions.The inhibitory effects of biflavonoids onDNA topoisomerases were studied by a re-laxation assay for topoisomerases I and II,and by a decatenation assay for topoisomer-ase II-α. Topoisomerase I was assayed byrelaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA assuggested by TopoGen, Columbus, OH,USA. Briefly, 0.125 µg of supercoiledpBR322 was incubated with 2 units of hu-man topoisomerase I in the presence or ab-sence of different drug concentrations for 30min at 37ºC in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1mM spermidine, 4% glycerol, and 0.1% BSA)and the reaction was stopped with 0.1 vol-ume of stopping solution (5% SDS, 0.025%bromophenol blue and 40% glycerol). Therelaxation products were analyzed in TAEbuffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.5, and 10mM Na2EDTA) by electrophoresis on 1%agarose gels at 45 V. Gels were stained withethidium bromide and photographed underUV light. Topoisomerase II was assayed bydecatenation of kDNA as described byTopoGen. Reactions contained 0.125 µg, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 120 mM KCl, 10 mMMgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol,821Braz J Med Biol Res 35(7) 2002Biflavonoids as DNA topoisomerase inhibitors30 µg/ml BSA, and 2 units of human topo-isomerase II in the presence or absence ofvarying amounts of drugs. The reaction mix-tures were incubated for 30 min at 37ºC andstopped with 0.1 volume of stopping solu-tion. For the topoisomerase II-α relaxationassay, the same buffer was incubated for 30min and 1 µg/ml proteinase K and 0.5% SDSwere added and incubated for an additional30 min at 37ºC under the same conditions asdescribed above. DNA topoisomers wereseparated by electrophoresis.The inhibitory effects of 200 µM biflavo-noids I, II and IIa on topoisomerase I areshown in Figure 1A. In the presence of I, IIand IIa only the band corresponding to thesupercoiled DNA was observed. The sameeffect was obtained with campothecin (50µM), used as a positive control. However,the glycosylated flavonoid rutin, used as nega-tive control, did not inhibit the topoisomer-ase I activity.The inhibition of human topoisomeraseII-α by biflavonoids demonstrated by decate-nation assay was observed only at a concen-tration of 200 µM, with a result similar to100 µM etoposide (Figure 1B). Figure 1Cshows the inhibitory effects of biflavonoidsdetermined by the relaxation assay for topo-isomerase II-α with an inhibitory patternsimilar to that shown above. Despite smalldifferences in chemical structure of the bi-flavonoids tested here, they have a similareffect on DNA topoisomerase I and a differ-ential effect on topoisomerase II-α. Biflavo-noid I (agathisflavone) affects the catalyticactivity of human DNA topoisomerase andis a dual inhibitor. Interestingly, it alsoshowed a borderline inhibitory effect onK562 leukemia cells.Our results suggest that biflavonoids Iand II are cytotoxic against Ehrlich tumorand that DNA topoisomerases are involvedin their cytotoxicity, with cytotoxic potencybeing dependent on the type of tumor. Fur-ther studies of flavonoids and their deriva-tives may lead to the elucidation of the roleof DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, thus con-tributing to the search for better natural che-motherapeutic and cancer preventing agents.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Dr. Jolie K.
