ABSTRACT
The enzyme aldose (aldehyde) reductase was partially purified (142-
fold) and characterized from Euonymus japonica leaves. The reductase,
a dimer, had an average molecular weight of 67,000 as determined by gel
filtration on Sephadex G-100. The enzyme was NADPH specific and
reduced a broad range of substrates including aldoses, aliphatic alde-
hydes, and aromatic aldehydes. Maximum activity was observed at pH 8
in phosphate and Tris-HCI buffers and at pH 8.6 to 9.0 in glycine-NaOH
buffer using DL-glyceraldehyde or 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde as substrate.
NADP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to NADPH with a K, of
60 micromolar. Glycerol was an uncompetitive inhibitor to DL-glyceral-
dehyde (K', = 460 millimolar). The Euonymus enzyme was inhibited by
sulfhydryl inhibitor, phenobarbitaL and high concentrations of Li2SO4.
Pyrzol and metal chelating agents inhibited the enzyme slightly. Enzyme
activity was detected in the leaves and berries of Celastrus orbiculatus
and several species of Euonymus. Probable function of this enzyme is to
reduce D-galactose to galactitol, a characteristic metabolite in phloem
sap of members of the Celastraceae family.
The biosynthesis of polyols in higher plants appears to be
through the reduction of aldose phosphates by NADPH to the
corresponding polyol phosphates. Three enzymes have been
characterized: aldose-6-P reductase (EC 1.1.1.200) reduces D-
glucose-6-P to sorbitol-6-P (16, 20), i-mannose-6-P reductase
(24) converts D-mannose-6-P to mannitol- 1 -P, and D-ribose-5-P
reductase (21) which reduces D-ribose-5-P to D-ribitol-5-P.
In other organisms, there are several possible reactions that
have been reported for polyol synthesis, e.g. the reduction of
aldoses or ketoses by either NADH or NADPH, and the reduc-
tion of aldose phosphates or ketose phosphates by either NADH
or NADPH (21).
Several NADPH-linked aldehyde reductases (alcohol: NADP
oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.2) have been isolated from mammalian
tissues. The broad and overlapping substrate specificities ofthese
enzymes have resulted in confusing nomenclature (13). These
enzymes reduce aliphatic aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes, and
aldo sugars to their alcohol forms. The enzyme aldose reductase
(EC 1.1.1.21), which is responsible for sorbitol synthesis, falls
into the general category of aldehyde reductases, but it has a
higher affinity for aldoses than other aldehyde reductases (8).
Galactitol (dulcitol) is a characteristic compound of the Celas-
traceae and a major carbohydrate in the phloem sap of this
family (3). Despite the fact that several horticultural crops con-
tain large amounts of galactitol, its metabolism in plants is not
known. The objective ofthis research is to purify and characterize
the enzyme responsible for galactitol biosynthesis in Euonymus
sp. as a first step towards understanding the role of these com-
pounds in plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chem-
ical Co. Glyoxal, erythrose, 3-pyridylcarbinol, and butyraldehyde
were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Protein standards for
gel filtration (low mol wt) were from Pharmacia, Inc. Bovine y-
globulin and all electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-
Rad laboratories. All buffers were adjusted to the desired pH at
room temperature. NADPH and NADH were dissolved in 1%
NaHCO3 and made immediately prior to use. NADP was dis-
solved in glass distilled H20. NADPH and NADP concentrations
were determined from the molar extinction coefficients of 6.22
x I03 at 340 nm and 18.0 x 103 cm-' M-1 at 260 nm, respectively.
Water insoluble chemicals were dissolved in absolute methanol
and dilutions were made in H20 thereafter. The presence of
2.5% methanol in the reaction mixture showed no effect on
enzyme activity.
Plant Material. Euonymus japonica leaves used for enzyme
purification were obtained from plants grown in a greenhouse
under long day conditions. Other Euonymus sp. plants were
grown outdoors and leaves were collected during the month of
August and were kept at -65C until they were used.
Enzyme Purification. All purification steps were conducted in
a cold room at 2 to 4°C. E. japonica fully expanded mature
leaves (150 g) were homogenized in 500 ml 0.2 M Tris-HCI buffer
(pH 8.0), containing 1 mM DTT, 10 mm isoascorbate, and 25 g
insoluble PVP. PVP was prewetted with buffer for 1 h prior to
homogenization. Leaves were homogenized first in a Sorval
Omni-mixer for four 20-s intervals at full speed, followed by
additional four 20-s intervals at full speed in a Polytron (Brink-
man) homogenizer. The homogenate was squeezed through six
layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 4,068g for 20 min. The
supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 23,430g and the pellet
was discarded. To the supernatant, solid (NH4)2SO4 was added
slowly with continuous stirring to give 40% saturation (24.3
g/100 ml). Stirring was continued for additional 20 min and the
precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 23,430g for 30 min.
The supernatant was made 75% saturation with solid (NH4)2SO4
(24.5 g/100 ml) as described above and the precipitate (40-75%
fraction) was collected by centrifugation at 23,430g for 30 min.
The pellet was dissolved in a minimum volume of 10 mM Tris-
HCI buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer
A) and dialyzed overnight against three changes (1 L each) of
buffer A.
The dialyzed 40 to 75% fraction was centrifuged at 26,890g
for 30 min and the pellet was discarded. This fraction was applied
to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.5 x 90 cm) and eluted with 50
mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoetha-
nol and 0.02% NaN3 (buffer B) at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. Active

fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon PM-
10 ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon Corporation).
The Sephacryl concentrate was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel
column (2.6 x 50 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B. The
column was washed with buffer B until no protein was detected
in the eluate (by monitoring UV A at 280 nm) and the enzyme
was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl in buffer B (1
L each) at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. Active fractions were pooled
and concentrated as described above.
The DEAE Sephacel concentrate was applied to a Sephadex
G-100 column (2.5 x 90 cm) previously equilibrated with 20
mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoetha-
nol and 0.02% NaN3 (buffer C). The enzyme was eluted with
buffer C at a flow rate of 17 ml/h and active fractions were
pooled and concentrated as described above.
The Sephadex concentrate was applied to a Sigma Reactive
Red 1 20-Agarose column (1 x 5 cm) which had been equilibrated
with buffer C. After 1 h at 0 flow, the column was washed with
buffer C until no protein was detected in the eluate. The enzyme
was then eluted with 0.35 mM NADPH in buffer C. Active
fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 L of
buffer A and concentrated as described above. The enzyme was
stored in small aliquots at -65°C until used for assays. Unless
otherwise indicated, this fraction was used for all studies reported
in this paper.
Protein Determination. Protein concentrations were deter-
mined according to the method of Bradford (4), using bovine y-
globulin as a standard.
Electrophoresis. PAGE was carried out in 7% w/v polyacryl-
amide gel at pH 8.9 according to Davis (10). Gels were stained
for protein according to Reisner (23). Gels were stained for the
reductase activity by incubating the gel first in 0.1 M glycine-
NaOH buffer (pH 9.5) for 1 h followed by a mixture consisting
of 0.4 mg/ml NADP, 0.39 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-
2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), 0.04 mg/ml phen-
azine methosulfate, and either glycerol, propylene glycol (1,2-
propanediol), galactitol, or 3-pyridylcarbinol (200 mm final con-
centration). Gels were kept in the dark at 37°C for 20 to 30 min
then washed in dH20 and stored in 7% acetic acid.
Molecular Weight Determination. The reductase mol wt was
estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.6 x
45 cm), calibrated with a mixture of known mol wt protein
standards (Pharmacia Instruction Manual). The column was
equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2)
containing 0.1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. The standard
enzyme assay was used to detect the reductase activity in the
eluate.
SDS-PAGE (1 % gel) was performed as described per Sigma
Technical Bulletin No. MWS-877L.
Enzyme Assay. Aldose reductase activity was assayed by re-
cording the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm in a
Perkin-Elmer model 552 spectrophotometer at 25C. The stand-
ard assay contained in a total volume of 1 ml: 90 mm sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 110 uM NADPH, enzyme (affinity
fraction), and 10 mM DL-glyceraldehyde. Unless otherwise spec-
ified, enzyme was incubated with NADPH for 2.5 min prior to
addition of substrate to start the reaction. The reference cuvette
contained all reagents except the substrate.
One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of
enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of 1 gmol NADPH/min at
25°C. Specific activity was expressed as units/mg protein.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Enzyme Purification. The results of a typical purification pro-
cedure are shown in Table I. The reductase was purified 142-
fold with a 13% yield using DL-glyceraldehyde as the substrate.
The partially purified enzyme wa stable at -65°C for more than
1 year. At 1C, the enzyme lost approximately 15% of its activity
after 2 weeks. The enzyme was retained by affinity material and
eluted with NADPH suggesting that the protein possesses the
dinucleotide fold (27).
When 31 gg of the final preparation was subjected to poly-
acrylamide disc electrophoresis, a single band of protein was
visible. This band corresponded to enzyme activity using either
glycerol, 3-pyridylcarbinol, propylene glycol, or galactitol (Fig.
1), suggesting that a single enzyme was responsible for the
reduction of these substrates. To further test the presence of a
single reductase, DL-glyceraldehyde, D-galactose, and 3-pyridi-
necarboxaldehyde were used as substrates at each step of the
purification procedure, and the ratio of these substrate activities
remained constant (data not shown). In addition, the pH profiles
for two substrates were identical (Fig. 2). These results indicate
the presence of a single enzyme with broad substrate specificity
and is similar to aldose and aldehyde reductases isolated from
mammalian sources (15, 31). The product ofthe reaction mixture
using D-galactose as a substrate was identified as galactitol by
GC and HPLC.
Effect of pH. The effect of the assay mixture pH on the
reduction of DL-glyceraldehyde and 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde
using three different buffer systems is shown in Figure 2. The
optimum pH range for both substrates was similar and depended
on the buffer used in the assay. Maximum activity was observed
at pH 8 in Na-phosphate and Tris-HCl buffers and at pH 8.6 to
9.0 in glycine-NaOH buffer. In addition, maximum velocity in
Tris-HCl buffer was less than that in phosphate or glycine-NaOH
buffer. Similar responses to the pH of the assay mixture have
been reported for aldehyde reductase from yeast (Rhodotorula
sp.) (30) and pig brain (29). The pH optimum for the Euonymus
enzyme was generally higher than other reductases (5.2 for
indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase from cucumber (6), 5.6 for fatty
aldehyde reductase from Brassica oleraceae (18), 7.0 for aldose
reductase from Vicia faba (19), and 6.5 for several mammalian
aldose reductases (22)).
Molecular Weight. The elution volume for the enzyme was
the same as BSA in Sephadex G-100, mol wt 67,000 (Fig. 3A).
PAGE (31 gg enzyme protein/gel) in the presence of SDS gave
one dark band corresponding to a mol wt of 36,000 (Fig. 3B)
and three lightly stained bands below it (Figure not shown). This
finding indicates that the aldose (aldehyde) reductase from E.japonica is a dimer. Most of the reported mol wt for aldose or
aldehyde reductases, a monomer, are in the range of 30,000 to
40,000 (8, 14, 31). However, aldose reductase isolated from
Rhodotorula (26) and calf liver (1) had a mol wt of 61,000.
Substrate Specificity. The Km values for several substrates
using NADPH as a cofactor are shown in Table II. The enzyme
was specific for NADPH and no activity was detected with 110
Mm NADH and 10 mM DL-glyceraldehyde. The enzyme reduced
a broad range of compounds ranging from aldoses to aliphatic
and aromatic aldehydes. The Km values for aldoses increased
with increasing number of carbon atoms. Activities with five-
carbon aldoses varied, depending on the sugar; D-ribose was
inactive, whereas L-arabinose had a lower Km value than L-xylose.
D-Lyxose was slightly active (Table III). D-Glucose was com-
pletely inactive as a substrate, but D-galactose had a Km value of
227 mm. Most of the aldose and aldehyde reductases isolated
from mammalian sources have reacted with D-glucose and D-
galactose (12, 15, 28). The high Km values for hexoses may be
caused by the requirement for a free aldehyde group in the
substrate (15) which would explain the low Km values for DL-
glyceraldehyde and D-erythrose (Table II).
The inability of the E. japonica enzyme to reduce D-glucose
and D-ribose could be explained by the requirement for a free
aldehyde group in the substrate. Hayman and Kinoshita (15)
reported that the Km for D-glucose was three times higher than

the Km, for D-galactose which agreed with the fraction of the sugar
in the free aldehyde form in solution. Recently, Inagakid et at.
(17) provided evidence that bovine lens aldose reductase acted
on the aldehyde formn of D-glucose (Km. = 0.66 gsm) rather than
the a or the anomers.
Results obtained with 2-deoxy sugars were notable. While D-
glucose and D-ribose were inactive as substrates, their deoxy
derivatives were reactive (Tables II and III). The Km, for 2-deoxy-
galactose was 20 times less than that of D-galactose. The absence
of the hydroxyl group at C2 probably removes an unfavorable
steric interaction with some groups on the enzyme. Conversely,
the presence of an amino group at C2 caused inactivity (i.e.
galactosamine). Absence of the OH group at (D-fucose) or
presence of COO--group (D>galacturonic acid) reduced the re-
activity of D1-galactose. The Euonymus enzyme was 21% as active
with L-fucose as with D-fucose, suggesting that the D-form of
galactose is the preferred substrate.
Aliphatic aldehydes (C2-C6) were good substrates for the en-
zyme as compared to aldoses (Table II). The Km. value for these
aldehydes decreased with increasing chain length. Similar results
were obtained with rat liver and pig brain aldehyde reductases

(12, 29). Aromatic aldehydes were the best substrates (highest
VmaxlKm ratio). Methyl- and phenylglyoxal derivatives showed
higher activity than glyoxal, but pyridine substitution (i.e. pyri-
dinecarboxaldehydes) resulted in a lower Km value compared to
phenylglyoxal.
Negligible rates were obtained in the reverse reaction with 3-
pyridylcarbinol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, L-
arabitol, and xylitol at pH 9.5 using 90 mM glycine-NaOH and
NADP (1 mM).
Phosphorylated sugars (glucose-6-P, galactose-6-P, 2-deoxyglu-
cose-6-P, ribose-5-P, 2-deoxyribose-5-P) were not active sub-
strates.
Product Inhibition. NADP was a competitive inhibitor when
NADPH was the variable substrate and DL-glyceraldehyde con-
centration was kept constant at 10 mM. Using the Dixon plot
(11), the Ki was 60 #M (Fig. 4). Glycerol appeared to be an
uncompetitive inhibitor of DL-glyceraldehyde (Fig. 5). The Ki'
value estimated from the Cornish-Bowden plot (7) was 460 mM.
Studies with aldose and aldehyde reductases from mammalian
sources showed that NADP was a competitive inhibitor relative
to NADPH (9, 22, 25). Glycerol was a competitive inhibitor of
DL-glyceraldehyde in one study (22) and noncompetitive inhibi-
tor in others (9, 31).
Effect of Inhibitors. A number of chemicals were incubated
with Euonymus reductase and NADPH for 5 min prior to
substrate addition to test their inhibitory effect (Table IV). Pyr-
azol, a potent inhibitor of NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogen-

Distribution of Aldose (Aldehyde) Reductase in the Celastra-
ceae. Leaves and berries of different species of Euonymus were
frozen and ground into fine powder in liquid N2. Powders were
extracted as described under "Materials and Methods" and
(NH4)2SO4 (40-75%) fractions were used for enzyme assays with
DL-glyceraldehyde and D-galactose as substrates as described
previously. Enzyme activity was detected in the following Eu-
onymus species: E. atropurpurea, E. bungeana, E. europaea
'Alba,' E. europaea 'Macrocarpa,' E. europaea 'Red Cascade,' E.
fortunei, E. hamiltoniana var maackii, E. hamiltoniana var
yedoensis 'Calocarpa,' E. nana var turkestanica, E. obovata, and
E. verrucosa. The specific activity of the (NH4)2SO4 fraction of
the above species was between 0.06 to 0.16 units/mg protein
using DL-glyceraldehyde as a substrate. The (NH4)2SO4 fraction
ofleaves and berries of several cultivars of E. alata, however, did
not show activity towards DL-glyceraldehyde or D-galactose even
though the galactitol content of the leaves reaches 5 to 8% dry
weight (data not shown). The reductase activity was also detected
in Celastrus orbiculatus (specific activity of [NH4]2SO4 fraction
= 0.02 units/mg protein).
CONCLUSIONS
The results presented above showed a procedure for isolating
the enzyme aldose (aldehyde) reductase from Euonymusjaponica
leaves with a high degree of purity. The enzyme was fairly stable
at 1°C and can be stored at -65C for more than 1 year.
Plant aldehyde reductases that were isolated from different
sources showed a high degree of substrate specificity, e.g. fatty
aldehyde reductase from Brassica oleracea (18) and indole-3-
aldehyde reductase from Cucumis sativus (6). Euonymusjapon-
ica reductase, however, was capable of reducing aldoses and
aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. In view of the low reaction
rate observed with alcohols, it appears that Euonymus enzyme
functions in aldehyde reduction rather than alcohol oxidation.
Since the physiological function of this enzyme is probably in
the synthesis of galactitol from D-galactose, it is appropriate to
suggest naming this enzyme aldose reductase (Alditol: NADP
oxidoreductase).
