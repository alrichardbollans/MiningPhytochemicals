R.E. Fries,Annonaceae, foram submetidos a fracionamentos cromatográficos. Nove sesquiterpenos (α-cubebeno,α-copaeno, germacreno-D, biciclogermacreno, γ-cadineno, δ-cadineno, espatulenol, globulol ecis-cubenol) além de um diterpeno (fitol) foram identificados no óleo volátil, correspondendo a83.1% (em massa) do total de constituintes. Dois sesquiterpenos (espatulenol e macrocarp-11(15)-en-8-ol), o último apresentando um novo esqueleto estrutural, um diterpeno (fitol), além de doisesteróides (sitosta-5,25-dien-3β-ol e sitosta-5,22,25-trien-3β-ol), foram isolados do extrato hexânico.As substâncias foram caracterizadas através de experimentos de RMN de 1H e 13C, incluindo análisebidimensional, além de espectrometria de massas.The volatile oil and the hexane extract from the leaves of Porcelia macrocarpa (Warm.) R.E.Fries, Annonaceae, were submitted to chromatographic separations. Nine sesquiterpenes (α-cubebene,α-copaene, germacrene-D, bicyclogermacrene, γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, spathulenol, globulol andcis-cubenol) and one diterpene (phytol) were identified in the volatile oil (83.1 % in weight). Twosesquiterpenes (spathulenol and macrocarp-11(15)-en-8-ol), the latter with a novel skeleton, onediterpene (phytol) and two steroids (sistosta-5,25-dien-3β-ol and sitosta-5,22,25-trien-3β-ol) wereisolated from the hexane extract. These compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMRspectroscopy, including bidimensional analysis and mass spectrometry.Keywords: macrocarpane, spathulenol, steroids, sesquiterpenes, Porcelia macrocarpaIntroductionThe chemical constitution of Porcelia macrocarpa wasdescribed in four previous papers. In the first one,acetogenins from seeds were reported.1 Two other papersreport the presence of amides, lignanamides and alkaloidsfrom the branches.2,3 The polar constituents, such asaminoacids, trimethylamonium salts and glycosilatedflavonoids were also described.4 From our previous studieswith P. macrocarpa we describe herein the identificationof nine sesquiterpenes and one diterpene in the volatileoil and two sesquiterpenes, one diterpene and two steroidsin the hexane extract, both from the leaves. The 1H and 13CNMR data of 10, including bidimensional analysis,showed a novel sesquiterpene skeleton, which wasdenominated macrocarpane.Results and DiscussionThe hexane extract of the leaves of P. macrocarpa wassubmitted to chromatographic separations to give twosesquiterpenes: spathulenol (7) and macrocarp-11(15)-en-8-ol (10), one diterpene: phytol (11) and two steroids:sistosta-5,25-dien-3β-ol (12) and sitosta-5,22,25-trien-3β-ol (13). The sesquiterpene 7, the diterpene 11 and thesteroids 12 and 13 were identified by analysis of their 1Hand 13C NMR data and comparison with data described inthe literature.5-817Macrocarpane, a New Sesquiterpene Skeleton from the Leaves of  Porcelia macrocarpaVol. 14, No. 1, 2003The EIMS spectrum of 10 showed the molecular ionpeak at m/z 220 Da. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT135°) displayed fifteen signals refering to three methyls,four methylenes, six methines, as well as two quaternarycarbon atoms, suggesting the occurrence of an oxygenatedsesquiterpene with molecular formula C15H24O. The signalsat δ 146.0 (C) and δ 105.7 (CH2) were indicative of anexocyclic methylenic group, and the single signal at thecarbinolic region [δ 77.4 (CH)] confirms the presence ofone hydroxyl group in the molecule of 10.The 1H NMR spectrum showed three methyl groups atδ 0.79 (s), δ 0.93 (s) and δ 0.93 (d, J 3.0 Hz), the latterbeing linked to a methinic carbon atom. This spectrumalso showed a signal at δ 0.51 (m), suggesting the presenceof a cyclopropane ring in the structure of 10. Theobservation of a double-multiplete at δ 48.6, in the gated13C NMR spectrum with J 163 Hz, characteristic of threemember ring,9 confirms the cyclopropane ring in themolecule. The HMQC spectrum showed long-rangecorrelations between carbons and hydrogens (Table 1).These results associated with those showed in 1H-1H COSYspectrum indicated the connectivities in the molecule, andsuggested a decahydroazulene derivative with acyclopropane ring. The mutual long range couplingbetween the signals at δ 1.48 (H-1) and δ 4.82 (H-15), δ2.28 (H-10) and δ 1.29 (H-5), the latter being a W coupling,corroborates the suggested structure and indicated the βorientation to cyclopropane ring. This spectrum alsoshowed the coupling between the hydrogens at C-9 andthose at C-10 and C-8; thus, the two methyl groups shouldbe at C-7. The presence of these groups interrupted the1H-1H connectivities in the seven member ring. Therefore,the cyclopropane group could only be at the five-carbonring. The mutual coupling observed among the signals atδ 0.51 (H-4) and δ 1.29 (H-5), and δ 1.18 (H-3) located thecyclopropane ring between C-3/C-5. This situation wascorroborated by the correlations between H-3/H-2 and H-3/H-6, observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. HMBC longrange correlations confirm the proposed structure. The smallcoupling constants of H-1 (W½ = 8 Hz) indicated a cis ringjunction between the five and seven member rings. Thechemical shift of methyl group at C-4 (δ 21.8) suggestedthe presence of this group at a position, free of δinteractions. This sesquiterpenic skeleton has not beendescribed in the literature yet, and was denominatedmacrocarpane. Therefore, the structure of 10 was definedas macrocarp-11(15)-en-8-ol.The biosynthetic pathway proposed to 10 shouldinvolve a himachalane derivative which was not detectedin this study, but has been isolated from Ferula latipinna(Umbelliferae),10 which could be formed by cyclization ofbicyclogermacrene (Figure 1). In the volatile oil, theabsence of 10 and the reduced amount of 7 (3.0%) couldbe explained by the predominance of germacrene-D(37.8%) and bicyclogermacrene (27.5%). In the hexaneextract, these sesquiterpenes were not detected, indicatingthat 7 and 10 should be formed from 4,11 corroborating theproposed biosynthetic pathway. The volatile oil from the leaves of P. macrocarpa wassubmitted to chromatographic separation and the fractionsobtained were analysed by GC.12 The sesquiterpenes 3, 4,7, 8 and 9 and the diterpene 11 were characterized as theTable 1. 1H and 13C NMR data for sesquiterpene 10 (500 and 125 MHz, δ, CDCl3)1H-1H coupling 1Ha (multiplicity, J/Hz) 13Cb HMBC1 1.29, 4.82, 2.28 1.48 (m) 57.8 1.96, 4.79,  4.822 1.96, 1.18 1.02 (dd, 12.0; 4.0) 42.71.02, 1.18 1.96 (dd, 12.0; 7.0)3 0.93, 1.96, 1.29,  1.02, 0.51 1.18 (m) 24.64 0.93, 1.18, 1.29 0.51 (m) 48.6 0.935 1.48, 1.18 1.29 (m) 24.46  0.51, 0.79, 1.18 0.93 (br dd, 10.0; 4.0) 32.4 0.937 - - 59.1 0.798 1.75, 1.43 3.51 (dd, 12.0; 5.5) 77.4 0.799 3.51, 2.28, 2.02, 1.75 1.43 (dq, 12.0; 5.5) 31.12.02, 1.43, 3.51, 2.28 1.75 (td, 12.0; 5.5)10 2.28, 1.75, 1.43, 4.79 2.02 (ddd, 14.0; 12.0; 5.5) 34.0 4.792.02, 1.43, 1.75, 1.48 2.28 (br dd, 14.0; 5.5)11 - - 146.012 0.93 0.79 (s) 13.813 - 0.93 (s) 21.9 0.9314 0.51 0.93 (d, 3.0) 21.815 1.48 4.82 (br s) 105.72.02 4.79 (br s)a…500 MHz; b…125 MHz.18 Chaves et al.

The comparison with the literaturevalues confirmed the proposed structures5,13-15.Additionally, the crude volatile oil was submitted toanalysis by GC/MS. The sesquiterpenes 1, 2, 5 and 6 wereidentified. This analysis confirms the identification of thesesquiterpenes 3, 4 and, 7, and the diterpene 11, whichwere characterized by NMR. Using this methodology,which is a combination of three spectrometric techniques(NMR, GC, GC/MS), nine sesquiterpenes, and onediterpene (83.1 % in weight) were identified  in the volatileoil (Table 2).ExperimentalPlant materialAll the leaves of P. macrocarpa (Warm.) R.E. Fries werecollected from the same specimen, in March 1992 (hexaneextract), and in December 2000 (volatile oil) at the JardimBotânico of São Paulo State. A voucher specimen has beendeposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Botânico, SãoPaulo, Brazil under reference SP76791.Extraction and isolation of the compoundsDried powdered leaves (750 g) of P. macrocarpa wereextracted with hexane three times at room temperature.The concentrated hexane extract was partitioned betweenMeOH/H2O (9:1, v/v) and hexane. The hexanic part (10 g)was submitted to precipitation with MeOH from whichwere obtained the waxy material (9 g), and the MeOHsoluble material (1 g). The MeOH/H2O phase (6 g) and theMeOH soluble material (1 g) were pooled together,chromatographed on silica gel column and eluted withincreasing amounts of EtOAc in hexane, from which wereobtained four groups (I-IV), after TLC on silica gel analyses.The group I (351 mg) was submitted to flashchromatography on silica gel and eluted with hexane-EtOAc (6:4, v/v) yielding 7 (77 mg). Group II (720 mg)was methylated with diazomethane, submitted to flashchromatography on silica gel and eluted with hexane-EtOAc (97:3, v/v) giving two mixtures A (359 mg), and B(30 mg). The 1H NMR spectrum of A showed the occurrenceof fatty acid esters. Fraction B was applied to a SephadexLH-20 column and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4, v/v)to yield 11 (10 mg). Group III (483 mg) was submitted toflash chromatography on silica gel and eluted with hexane-[CH2Cl2-MeOH (98:2, v/v)] (6:4, v/v) to give two mixturesC (30 mg) and D (200 mg). Mixture C was comprised oftwo steroids (12 and 13). Mixture D was applied to aSephadex LH-20 column and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2(1:4, v/v) to give a mixture of one sesquiterpene andsteroidal material. The purification by prep. TLC on silicagel with 15% of AgNO3 [hexane-EtOAc (6:4, v/v)] yielded10 (15 mg).The fresh plant material (2250 g) was hydrodistilledTable 2.

Part of this material (500 mg)was submitted to flash chromatography on silica gel andeluted with CH2Cl2 and CH2Cl2-MeOH (95:5 and 9:1)affording mixtures containing 1 + 3 + 4 (fr 4, 137 mg), 3 +4 (fr 6, 25 mg), 11 (fr 34, 16 mg), 7 (fr 38, 12 mg), 8 + 9 (fr39, 52 mg).  The remaining part of the crude volatile oilwas subjected to analysis by GC/MS to identify thesesquiterpenes 1, 2, 5 and 6.GeneralSilica gel 60 (Merck) was used for chromatography:63-200 µm for CC, 40-63 µm for flash chromatography,PF254 (5-45 µm) for preparative TLC. IR spectra wereobtained as KBr pellets in a Perkin-Elmer InfraredSpectrometer model 1750. Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) wasused for molecular exclusion chromatography. NMRspectra were recorded at 300 and 500 MHz for 1H and 75and 125 MHz for 13C on Brüker DPX-300 and DRX-500spectrometers using CDCl3 as solvent and internal standard.The GC analysis was performed in a Hewlett-Packard 5890series II (using helium as carrier gas) equipped with a FIDdetector and a capillary column HP-5, crosslinked 5%phenyl in 95% methyl silicone (30 m x 0.32 mm, filmthickness 0.25 µm) with a automatic injector (HP 7673)and an electronic integrator (HP 3396A). The temperatureprogramming was from isothermal 100 °C for 2 min, 100°-240 °C at 5°C.min-1, then isothermal at 240 °C for 5 min.The (FID) injector and detector temperatures were 180 °Cand 260 °C, respectively. The GC/MS analyses were carriedout in an EIMS 70 eV Hewlett-Packard HP-5973 coupledwith a Hewlett-Packard HP-6890 with a DB-50 column(30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) using the sametemperature programming conditions describe above. Theidentification of the compounds was done by comparingretention indices (determined relatively to the retentiontimes of a series of n-alkanes) and mass spectra to those ofauthentic samples.Macrocarp-11(15)-en-8-ol (10): colourless oil.
