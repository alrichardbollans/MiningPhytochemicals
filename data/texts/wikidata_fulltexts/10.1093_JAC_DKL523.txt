A bioassay-guided fractionation of the traditional preparation of laurel oilfrom Madeira Islands was performed, yielding pure compounds chemically identified by standard pro-cedures. Synergism of pure compounds was established by X/Y quotient analysis adapted to FMABA.Results: Sesquiterpene lactones, costunolide and dehydrocostuslactone, were the compounds respon-sible for the antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv with MICs of 6.25 and12.5 mg/L, respectively. Antimycobacterial activity against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolateswas better for the mixture than for pure compounds.Conclusions: Both lactones presented synergistic activity, i.e. analysis of relative fluorescence unitspresented an X/Y value <0.5 at a concentration of 1/8 MIC of each compound in the combination.Establishment of synergism by FMABA represents another application of the microplate AlamarBlue assay.Keywords: costunolide, dehydrocostuslactone, Alamar Blue, synergismIntroductionThe resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most seriouspublic-health challenges of the 21st century. Despite continuedcontrol efforts, TB remains a leading cause of illness and deathworldwide. The recent rise of TB is associated with the emergenceof the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the rapid spreadof multidrug-resistant TB strains. There is therefore a requirementfor new classes of antibacterial compounds that have activityagainst these strains. Naturally occurring pure compounds as wellas extracts from higher and lower forms of plants and terrestrialand marine organisms have indicated that inhibitory activityagainst Mycobacterium tuberculosis is widespread in nature.1Preparations of plants containing sesquiterpene lactones are oftenused in traditional medicine.2 These compounds are starting toreceive more attention regarding their potential biologicalactivities, since there has been solid evidence that they possessanti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antimicrobial activities.3–5Laurel oil, the oil expressed from the ripe fruit of Laurus novo-canariensis (the Laurus subspecies found in the Madeira archipe-lago) has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. It isexternally applied to treat skin infections and as an anti-rheumaticand vulnerary. It is internally taken as a blood depurative, sto-machic and haemostatic. Folk medicine recommends laurel oil forthe treatment of influenza and other respiratory symptoms as wellas for apoplexy and constipation.6 The chemical characterizationof the whole oil was recently published, and its sesquiterpenelactone content was quantitatively determined, with averagevalues of 3.8% costunolide and 1.5% dehydrocostuslactone.7,8To our knowledge, laurel oil has not previously been studiedfor its potential as an anti-TB herbal medicine.

Oil samples were obtained from localproducers, and production was monitored to assure authenticity.Fractionation by different methods was used to separate thevarious families of compounds.Fractionation of laurel oil by liquid–liquid partitionThe separation of laurel oil into essential oil (EO), lipids andlactones is fully described in Castilho et al.7 Briefly, volatilecomponents were removed by hydrodistillation of the oil in aClevenger-type apparatus to yield the EO and an odourlessresidue containing the lipids and other non-volatile compounds.The residue was partitioned between n-hexane and methanol toseparate the lipid fraction (LF) from the more polar compounds,including the lactones. The methanolic fraction (MF) containingmainly the lactones costunolide (1) and dehydrocostuslactone(2) was further fractioned by column chromatography; 1 and 2(Figure 1) were identified by their mass spectra, and proton andcarbon NMR spectra and their purity established as .95% bygas chromatography.Mycobacterium strains and clinical isolatesThe Mycobacterium species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv(ATCC 27294), H37Rv isoniazid-resistant (ATCC 35822),H37Rv rifampicin-resistant (ATCC 35838) and H37Rvethambutol-resistant (ATCC 35837), were obtained from theAmerican Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD).Three drug-resistant pulmonary isolates of M. tuberculosis wereobtained from patients from different hospitals in Mexico. Thedrug-resistant isolates were selected based on their drug suscepti-bility patterns to the antimycobacterial drugs determined by theAlamar Blue microplate method. Three non-tuberculous myco-bacteria clinical isolates (Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacteriumchelonae and Mycobacterium fortuitum) and the Mycobacteriumsmegmatis (mc2) reference strain were also employed.Growth conditions and inoculum preparationReference strains and clinical isolates were cultured at 378C inMiddlebrook 7H9 broth (BBL) supplemented with 0.2% glyceroland 10% OADC enrichment (oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase; Difco) until log-phase growth was achieved. Inoculafor the fluorometric assays were prepared by diluting log-phasegrowth cultures with sterile Middlebrook 7H9 broth to turbiditiesequivalent to that of a no. 1 McFarland standard and thenfurther diluted 1:10 for tuberculous mycobacteria and 1:50 fornon-tuberculous mycobacteria.Antimycobacterial activity determination by fluorometricmicroplate Alamar Blue assayThe methodology was fully described in Jimenez-Arellanes et al., 9but some modifications were made in the present study. Briefly,stock solutions of whole oil and EO, LF and MF were preparedin DMSO at a concentration of 20 g/L; pure compounds 1 and 2were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 5 g/L understerile conditions and stored at –708C until use. Serial dilutionsof each fraction or compound were prepared; final testing con-centrations ranged from 200 to 50 mg/L for whole oil, 200 to12.5 mg/L for fractions and 50 to 1.75 mg/L for pure com-pounds. Duplicates of each sample were made per plate, andeach experiment was repeated at least twice. Bacterial suspen-sion (100 mL) was added to test wells and to controls. A 1:10diluted control was included in each plate representing thegrowth of 10% of the bacterial population tested (10% control).Plates were incubated at 378C. After 5 days of incubation, theplates were developed by adding to each well 20 mL of AlamarBlue solution (Trek Diagnostics, Westlake, OH) and incubatingfor 24 h. Fluorescence was measured in a plate fluorometer(Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo, Finland) at an excitation wave-length of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 540 nm, andrelative fluorescence units (rfu) were recorded. MIC was definedas the lowest drug concentration that presented rfu values lowerthat those presented by the 10% growth control. There wasalways a correlation between fluorometric and visual obser-vations, i.e. pink wells presented high rfu values.Determination of synergistic antimycobacterial activityby fluorometric Alamar Blue microassaySynergistic antimycobacterial activity was evaluated againstM. tuberculosis H37Rv, by a modification of the fluorometricAlamar Blue microassay, using combinations of the two purelactones 1 and 2, at one-half, one-fourth and one-eighth of theMIC previously determined in the antimycobacterial assaydescribed earlier. The assay was performed in 96-well micro-plates (Costar). Briefly, working solutions of both compoundswere prepared in 7H9 broth, at a concentration corresponding tofour times the MIC when 1/2 of MIC combination was analysed;for 1/4 and 1/8 MICs combinations, compound solutions wereprepare at two times and one time the corresponding MICs. Atleast two wells per combination were used.Working solutions of costunolide (50 mL) and dehydrocostus-lactone (50 mL) were added simultaneously to the well andmixed thoroughly, and then 100 mL of the bacterial suspension(adjusted to a turbidity equivalent to that of a no. 1 McFarlandstandard and diluted 1:10) was added. Controls for each purecompound were obtained by adding 50 mL of the correspondingworking solution and 50 mL of 7H9 broth, and finally adding100 mL of the same adjusted bacterial suspension. To check bac-terial growth, controls free of drug were also obtained by addingOOHHOOH1 2Figure 1.

Plates were sealed and incubatedfor 5 days at 378C; after this period, 20 mL of Alamar Bluesolution was added to the wells and reincubated overnight at378C. Finally, rfu were measured in the plate fluorometer.ResultsThe whole laurel oil without any further preparation (i.e. theherbal remedy, as usually sold to patients in local pharmacies)was tested by the Alamar Blue microassay against M. tuberculosisH37Rv, showing a considerable activity that reached an MIC,50 mg/L (Figure 2a). These results moved us to perform its sep-aration into families of compounds.From the oil, three main preparations were obtained, eachcontaining different types of compounds: EO consisted predomi-nately of non-oxygenated mono and sesquiterpenes; LF pre-sented mostly triglycerides and small amounts of sterols; andMF is composed mostly of sesquiterpene lactones. The anti-mycobacterial activity of these preparations is presented inTable 1; it is evident that the anti-TB activity of the oil resides050100100200200300400500Relative fluorescence units100%10%0100200300400500600700ControlCONT 1/8 Comp 1 1/8 Comp 2 1/8 Comp 1+1/8 Comp 2Laurel oilRelative fluorescence unitsy = 399x = 189(a)(b)x/y=0.47Figure 2.

MICs for the different strains and isolatesanalysed ranged from 3.25 to 50 mg/L. However, none of thepreparations was active against the group of non-tuberculousmycobacteria studied (MICs .200 mg/L). From the active MF,costunolide 1 and dehydrocostuslactone 2 were isolated, and theirantimycobacterial activities were also determined (Table 1).The activity against H37Rv-INH-r, a strain resistant only toisoniazid was the most interesting result (Table 1), not onlybecause the MF presented the highest activity, but because thepure compounds obtained from it (1 and 2) were less active thanthe whole fraction, hence the awareness of a possible synergisticeffect between those lactones.Determination of pharmacological interactions was per-formed following X/Y quotient analysis, as described by otherauthors.10,11 X represents the rfu value obtained with the combi-nation of both compounds, and Y is the rfu value of the com-pound that presented the lowest rfu value, when alone. Synergywas considered when the X/Y value was ,0.5, additive activitywhen X/Y was .0.5 and ,1.0, no activity when X/Y was 1–2,and antagonism when X/Y was .2.In order to establish a synergistic effect between 1 and 2, asimple determination was made based on the fluorometric micro-plate Alamar Blue assay principles as described in the Materialsand methods section. The X/Y quotient was calculated based onthe rfu values recorded. X was the value obtained with bothcompounds, and Y was the value of compound 2 (the lower rfuvalue of the compounds tested alone). Synergism, consideredwhen the X/Y quotient was ,0.5, was present up to the combi-nation containing 1/8 MIC of each compound (Figure 2b).DiscussionSesquiterpenes are C-15 terpenoids that occur in nature ashydrocarbons or oxygenated forms such as alcohols, ketones,aldehydes, acids or lactones. The majority of the more than4000 known different lactone structures have a guaiane, eudes-mane or germacrane framework. Costunolide (Figure 1) is struc-turally the simplest of all germacranolides, and it is generallyaccepted as the parent compound of the three mentioned typesof sesquiterpene lactones.12Costunolide 1 and dehydrocostuslactone 2 were found asmajor components of the MF of Madeira Laurus oil8 and havebeen suggested to possess various biological activities.3 – 5 Inthe present work, we confirm that both lactones presented animportant inhibitory action against both drug-susceptible anddrug-resistant M. tuberculosis at MICs as low as 6.25 mg/L(range 50–6.25 mg/L). This activity corresponds to the rangespreviously described by Cantrell et al. for sesquiterpene lac-tones of the germacranolide, guaianolide and eudesmanolidetype.13 Costunolide was reported to have an MIC of 32 mg/Lagainst M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and dehydrocostuslactone (MICof 2 mg/L) was reported as the most active compound ofthe series of guaianolides screened against M. tuberculosis.14Both previous determinations were performed using the radiore-spirometric BACTEC system, and here by the Alamar Bluemicroassay, confirming the usefulness of the Alamar Blue micro-assay and its correlation with other established standard determi-nations. The significant activity of dehydrocostuslactone hasbeen attributed to its high lipophilicity since introduction ofhydroxyl groups to different positions of the guaianolide skeletonsignificantly reduced the antimycobacterial activity;14 moleculeswith increased polarity have been reported to present a reducedtransport through the outer lipid layer of the mycobacteria and,consequently, lower activity towards the mycobacteria. However,lipophilicity may not be high enough to allow the molecule tocross the cell walls of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria studied,since no activity was observed against this group. Additionalstudies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.An important conclusion from our study is the fact thatfurther steps of purification of extracts and fractions end up inTable 1.

We approached this possibilityby establishing a new application of the Alamar Blue microplateassay, the determination of synergism by the establishment ofX/Y quotient analysis.10 – 11 Fluorometric Alamar Blue determi-nations are quantitative as they are measured in relative fluor-escence units. So, in accordance with previously used X/Yquotient analysis with radiometric units obtained with theBACTEC system (radiometric units, e.g. growth index), weadopted this procedure by substituting radiometric units byfluorometric units. Our results clearly showed the usefulness ofthe approach by establishing that compounds 1 and 2 had asynergistic effect, up to the combination containing 1/8 MIC ofeach compound.Such compounds having antimicrobial properties in additionto their other pre-designated pharmacological actions are cur-rently referred to as ‘non-antibiotics’. Most antimycobacterialnon-antibiotics reported so far have shown in vitro MIC valuesranging from 10 to 25 mg/L, which seem to be in accordancewith those of sesquiterpene lactones 1 and 2.15Costunolide and dehydrocostuslactone, being non-steroidalanti-inflammatory compounds, with modest in vitro antimyco-bacterial potential that is well enhanced when the two com-pounds appear together, as in Madeira laurel oil, raise thepossibility that laurel oil might be used as an adjuvant to currentregimens used for the management of newly diagnosed TBpatients. In future work, we aim to obtain enriched fractionswith mixtures of these compounds with a synergistic effect,avoiding laborious purification steps, enhancing yield and redu-cing costs, thereby making a new generation of potential non-antibiotic antitubercular mixtures.AcknowledgementsThis work was developed under PIBATUB project, CYTEDprogram auspices.
