From the bark of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Sterculiaceae), nine compounds were isolated and 
identified: ent-catechin, epicatechin, ent-gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, epiafzelechin-(4β→8)-
epicatechin, epicatechin-(4β→8)-catechin (procyanidin B1), epicatechin-(4β→8)-epicatechin 
(procyanidin B2), epicatechin-(4β→8)-epigallocatechin, and the new compound 4’-O-methyl-
epiafzelechin. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral and literature data. HPLC 
fingerprint analysis of the semipurified extract was performed on a C18 column, with a mixture 
of acetonitrile (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid):water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) (v/v) with a flow 
rate of 0.8 mL min-1. The sample injection volume was 100 µL and the wavelength was 210 nm.

Introduction
Despite extensive destruction, it is believed that the 
rainforests still preserve 30 million individual species, 
roughly half of all life forms on earth and 2/3 of all plants, 
without mentioning the importance of these forests to the 
earth’s weather and atmosphere. In South America, the 
Amazon tropical forest covers approximately 665 million 
hectares, of which 60% lies within Brazil, covering 59% 
of the country’s territory, in nine states: Acre, Amapá, 
Amazonas, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, 
Roraima and Tocantins.1
The importance of conserving the Amazon tropical 
forest is not limited only to the animal and plant species 
themselves, but also to the rich knowledge of the local 
people about the use of medicinal plants. Their knowledge 
stems as much from the necessity for alternative treatments 
because of low purchasing power and the difficulty of 
access to medical assistance, as from the profound cultural 
influence of the indigenous peoples of the region.
It is known that rapid social, cultural and economic 
changes strongly affect local knowledge of how to use 
natural resources. The problems stemming from this 
cultural loss are irreversible, and this loss reduces the 
possibilities of sustainably developing a region based on 
local experience.2
The discussion of alternatives for development and their 
relationship with the productive use of biodiversity is recent 
in Brazil. A proposal for sustainable development seeks to 
ally the need to protect the environment with the principal 
of equity with present and future human generations, 
through effective inclusion of the environment in socio-
economic decisions. However, it is no simple matter to 
develop a strategy that requires many solutions acting in 
parallel, including the demarcation of forest preserves, 
projects for renewable forest harvesting, and domestication 
Condensed Tannins from the Bark of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Sterculiaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1104
of local species of economic importance, envisaging local 
productive networks. Thus, surrounding the interest in 
biodiversity are many economic, ecological, ethical and 
heritage factors.3
In this context, many endemic and non-native plant 
species in Amazonia have been studied scientifically, taking 
into consideration the knowledge of the local population, 
with a view toward obtaining new phytotherapeutic and 
cosmetic pharmaceuticals.4-9
Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. is a middle-sized tree, 
belonging to the family Sterculiaceae, which occurs 
naturally throughout Latin America.10 In Brazil, where it 
is popularly known as mutamba, this species extends from 
the Amazon region to the state of Paraná.11 It is pantropical, 
semideciduous, heliophytic, a pioneer, and is characteristic 
of second-growth broad-leaf forests. In Brazil, G. ulmifolia 
has been studied for its important role for the recovery of 
degraded areas.10,11
In popular medicine, G. ulmifolia is traditionally used in 
several countries including Brazil,12 Guatemala,13-15 Haiti,16 
Mexico,17-19 and Belize20 to treat bronchitis, burns, diarrhea, 
asthma, inflammations, and alopecia.
Previous investigations of the chemical composition of 
G. ulmifolia have indicated the occurrence of flavan-3-ols, 
procyanidins,21 and the nitrile glucoside menisdaurin.22 The 
anti-diabetic properties,23 hypotensive and vasorelaxant 
activity,24 antiulcer,25,26 anti-bacterial activities,20,27 and 
antiviral activity28 of the bark, aerial parts, fruits, crude 
extract, and fractions were attributed to the presence of 
proanthocyanidins.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
chemical profile of the bark of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., to 
develop a HPLC-UV fingerprint and characterize its major 
active chemical constituents.
Results and Discussion
The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction obtained from 
the aqueous acetone extract of the air-dried bark was 
chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column. Fractions 
containing proanthocyanidins were further purified by 
multi-layer-coil counter-chromatography (MLCCC) 
to give known and some rare compounds including 
ent-catechin (1), epicatechin (2), ent-gallocatechin (3), 
epigallocatechin (4), epiafzelechin-(4β→8)-epicatechin 
(5), epicatechin-(4β→8)-catechin (PB1) (6), epicatechin-
(4β→8)-epicatechin (PB2) (7) and epicatechin-(4β→8)-
epigallocatechin (8). These were readily identified by 
comparison of spectroscopic data of the peracetates 
(1H NMR, ESI-MS, [a]D20) with authentic material.29-37 
The new compound 4’-O-methyl-epiafzelechin (9), 
discussed below, was established by physical properties 
[1H NMR, ESI-MS, [a]D20] of the corresponding peracetate 
derivative.
Compound (9a) was visualized as a blue spot by 
spraying with FeCl3 reagent and showed a parent ion 
at m/z 437.5 [M+Na]+ in the ESI-mass spectrum of the 
corresponding peracetate, suggesting a monomeric flavan-
3-ol. The 1H NMR spectral (CDCl3) data showed one 
three-proton singlet at d 3.89, indicating a methoxyl group. 
All heterocyclic protons could readily be assigned from the 
1H-1H-COSY spectrum. The compound showed a specific 
rotation of −30°, and showed the typical spin systems of 
a 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavan-3-ol framework, i.e., a two-spin 
AB-system for the A-ring, a four-spin AA1BB1-system 
for the B-ring, and a four-spin AMXY-system for the 
protons of the heterocyclic ring. The 2,3-cis relative 
configuration was evident from the 3J2,3 value of ca. 1.0 Hz 
for the broadened 2-H resonance at d 5.12. The circular 
dichroism (CD) spectrum in methanol exhibited a high-
amplitude negative Cotton effect at 280 nm for the 1Lb 
transition and a positive Cotton effect at 240 nm for the 
1L
a
 transition, hence unequivocally indicating a 2R,3R 
absolute configuration and confirming the structure of 
compound (9) as 4’–O-methyl-epiafzelechin from the 
natural source. This compound is described here for the 
first time.
An HPLC fingerprint method developed for Guazuma 
ulmifolia can be conveniently employed for quality-control 
analysis. The experimental conditions chosen were those 
giving the most chemical information about the herbal 
medicine in the chromatograms. The column, mobile phase, 
detection wavelength, and conditions for gradient elution 
were all investigated.
The chromatographic separations were performed on a 
C18 analytical column, according to published methods.38,39 
To obtain good separation, acetonitrile-water and methanol-
water, both containing acid, were investigated as mobile 
phases. With methanol-water the peaks of compounds 6 
and 7 always coeluted. More compounds were separated 
by the use of acetonitrile-water containing 0.05% 
trifluoroacetic acid. To obtain chromatograms with good 
Lopes et al. 1105Vol. 20, No. 6, 2009
resolution of adjacent peaks, different flow rates (0.6, 0.8, 
and 0.9 mL min-1) were also investigated. Good separation 
was obtained by a flow rate of 0.8 mL min-1.
The elimination of high-molar-mass phenolic 
compounds from the plant extract is critically important, 
because of the interaction of these compounds with the 
stationary phase. This interaction can seriously damage the 
analytical column, interfering with the chromatographic 
process. Currently, the most widely employed sample-
preparation methodologies are solid-phase extraction 
and liquid-liquid extraction. Therefore, in this study, 
the extraction of proanthocyanidin compounds from G. 
ulmifolia was optimized by using a mixture of water:ethyl 
acetate. The utilization of the simple one-step liquid-liquid 
extraction method should completely extract the target 
constituents from the matrix. The extraction efficiency 
was evaluated by HPLC, and the results demonstrated the 
reliability of the process.
The choice of detection wavelength is a crucial step 
in developing a reliable fingerprint. A UV detector was 
used in the current study. The spectra of all the main 
peaks were investigated by use of the diode-array detector, 
and 210 nm was selected as the detection wavelength to 
obtain a sufficiently large number of detectable peaks in 
the chromatograms. Figure 1 shows the chromatograms 
of the sample solution at 210 and 280 nm. Comparing the 
absorbances at the two wavelengths, the absorbances at 
210 nm were higher than those at 280 nm for all compounds 
in the system. Thus, chromatograms recorded at 210 nm 
showed considerable improvement in the signal-to-noise 
ratio.
The total analysis time for each run was 32 min. Good 
separations with a short run time were observed (Figure 2). 
The system suitability results are given in Table 1.
Method precision was based on replicated analyses of 
samples, with reported relative standard deviations (RSD) 
less than 5% for relative retention times (RRT) and relative 
peak areas (RPA) of all peaks. The reproducibility of the 
method was assessed by means of six replicated sample 
solutions extracted from a single batch of G. ulmifolia. 
The corresponding RSD of RRT and RPA were less than 
5% over the investigation. The stability test was performed 
with a sample solution left to stand for 24 h. The results 
obtained in the study of the solution (both time zero and 
the sample solution after 24 h) indicated that the solutions 
were stable for 24 h, because during this time the areas of 
the peaks did not decrease below a minimum percentage 
of 90% of the initial area. The data were assessed by 
Student’s t test and ANOVA, and showed no significant 
differences (p < 0.05%). The results showed that the 
method developed is a straightforward, sensitive, and 
selective tool with good accuracy and reproducibility, 
which can be readily utilized as a suitable method for 
quality control of G. ulmifolia.

200 g of this fraction was redissolved in 2.5 L H2O and 
extracted with EtOAc (35 L). After evaporation of solvents, 
the EtOAc fraction (GU) and the remaining H2O phase (GU-1) 
gave dark-brown solids of 24 and 174 g, respectively. 
A portion (19 g) of the GU fraction was subjected to CC 
on Sephadex LH-20 [710×50 mm; eluents: 20% EtOH 
(3.2 L), 30% EtOH (1.8 L), 40% EtOH (4.8 L), 50% 
EtOH (3.9 L), 100% EtOH (1.6 L), 50% MeOH (2.3 L), 
and 70% Me2CO (6 L); 10 mL fractions] afforded 29 
fractions (indicated with Roman numerals). Fraction XII 
(706 mg) was separated by MLCCC, with the solvent system 
EtOAc-n-PrOH-H2O (35:2:2) on a P.C. Inc. ITO Multi-
layer Coil Separator-Extractor, flow rate 1.0 mL min-1, 
using the upper layer as mobile phase, giving rise to 
5 subfractions. A portion of subfraction XII-4 (31 mg) 
was acetylated and purified by preparative TLC to yield 
the peracetate resulting in epigallocatechin (1.4 mg) and 
ent-gallocatechin (2.2 mg) (these subfractions are indicated 
below by ordinal numbers). Fraction XIII (376 mg) was 
submitted to the MLCCC as mentioned above, giving rise 
to 5 subfractions. A portion of subfraction XIII-1 (47.8 mg) 
was acetylated and purified by preparative TLC to yield the 
peracetate of 4’-O-methyl-epiafzelechin (2.2 mg) (9a). A 
portion of subfraction XIII-2 (123.1 mg) was acetylated 
and purified by preparative TLC to yield the peracetates of 
ent-catechin (14.2 mg) and epicatechin (13.1 mg). Fraction 
XIV (1156.5 mg) was separated on MLCCC as mentioned 
above, giving 5 subfractions. Subfraction XIV-1 (8.1 mg) 
was acetylated and purified by preparative TLC to yield 
the peracetate of epicatechin-(4β→8)-epigallocatechin 
(4.9 mg). Subfraction XIV-2 (198.1 mg) was acetylated 
and yielded epiafzelechin-(4β→8)-epicatechin. Subfraction 
XIV-3 (711.2 mg) was acetylated and yielded epicatechin-
(4β→8)-epicatechin (PB2). A portion of subfraction XIV-4 
(41 mg) was acetylated and purified by preparative TLC 
to yield the peracetate of epicatechin-(4β→8)-catechin 
(PB1) (4.8 mg).
General
1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian 
Mercury 300BB (300 MHz) and Varian Inova (500 MHz) at 
ambient temperature with TMS as the internal standard. CD 
data were obtained in MeOH on a Jasco J-815. Polarimetry 
was measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241. An ESI-MS mass 
spectrometer, Quattro LCZ from Waters, was used in the 
positive-ion mode. Compounds were revealed by spraying 
with vanillin-HCl reagent and 1% ethanolic FeCl3 solution 
on TLC. Analytical TLC was carried out on precoated 
aluminum sheets (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.2 mm, Merck) 
using EtOAc:HCOOH:H2O (90:5:5). Preparative TLC was 
performed on silica-gel plates (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.5 mm, 
Merck) using toluene:Me2CO (60:40). Acetylation was 
performed in pyridine-Ac2O (1:1.2) at ambient temperature 
for 24 h.

HPLC characterization
Chemicals and reagents
All reagents and solvents were analytical or HPLC 
grade, including the ethyl acetate and trifluoroacetic acid 
(TFA) (Merck, Germany). Ultra-pure water obtained using 
a Milli-Q UF-Plus apparatus (Millipore, USA) was used 
in all experiments.
Instrumentation and chromatographic conditions
The analyses were carried out using a HPLC system 
(Gilson, USA) consisting of a solvent delivery pump (Model 
321), a variable wavelength UV/Vis detector (Model 156), 
a manual injection valve (Rheodyne, USA) with a 20 µL 
loop, degasser (Model 184), and a thermostatted column 
compartment (Model 831). Data collection and analyses 
were performed using UniPoint LC System Software 
(Gilson, France). Gradient elution was performed on a 
Phenomenex Gemini RP C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm) 
(Phenomenex International, USA), 5 µm particle size 
with a Phenomenex SecurityGuard (RP C-18 cartridge) 
(20 mm x 4.6 mm). The mobile phase consisted of water 
(0.05% TFA) as solvent A and acetonitrile (0.05% TFA) as 
solvent B, and both were degassed and filtered through a 
0.45 µm pore-size filter (Millipore, USA). Separations were 
effected by a linear gradient as follows: 0 min 13% B; 10 min 
17% B; 16 min 19.35% B; 20 min 22.65% B; 23 min 29.81% 
B; 25 min 65% B; 28 min 13% B; and 32 min 13% B. The 
mobile-phase flow rate was 0.8 mL min-1 and the injection 
volume was 100 µL. The chromatographic runs were carried 
out at 28 °C. UV detection was performed at 210 nm.
For the determination of peak purity, the Varian ProStar 
module (Varian, USA) with ProStar 210 Solvent Delivery 
and a ProStar 335 HPLC-DAD was used.
Sample preparation and purification
An accurately weighed portion of 50 mg of the CE was 
dissolved in 500 µL water, mixed in a tube shaker, and 
extracted with 500 µL ethyl acetate, in a microtiter shaker 
at 1800 rpm (IKA, MS1 Minishaker) for 3 min (n=6). The 
tubes were then placed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge 
(Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5415R), at 4,000 rpm, for the 
total separation of the phases, for 4 min at 5 °C. The ethyl 
acetate phase was separated. After evaporation of solvents, 
and drying under air flow, the residue was reconstituted to 
10 mL with methanol:water (1:1; v/v) (Solution test–SS). 
The sample was filtered through a 0.5 µm membrane 
filter (Millipore, USA). The sample injection volume was 
100 µL.
