Sprouts of chicory (Cichorium intybus), a vegetable grown in the dark, have a slightly bitter taste associated with the presence
of guaianolides, eudesmanolides, and germacranolides. The committed step in the biosynthesis of these compounds is
catalyzed by a (1)-germacrene A synthase. Formation of the lactone ring is the postulated next step in biosynthesis of the
germacrene-derived sesquiterpene lactones. The present study confirms this hypothesis by isolation of enzyme activities
from chicory roots that introduce a carboxylic acid function in the germacrene A isopropenyl side chain, which is necessary
for lactone ring formation. (1)-Germacrene A is hydroxylated to germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol by a cytochrome P450
enzyme, and is subsequently oxidized to germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid by NADP1-dependent dehydrogenase(s).
Both oxidized germacrenes were detected as their Cope-rearrangement products elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol and elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid, respectively. The cyclization products of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol, i.e. costol, were also
observed. The (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase is inhibited by carbon monoxide (blue-light reversible), has an optimum pH
at 8.0, and hydroxylates b-elemene with a modest degree of enantioselectivity.
Wild chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a blue-flowered
composite plant that has spread all over the world
from the Mediterranean and east Asia. Since the sev-
enteenth century it has been cultivated (var sativum)
for its bitter roots that were roasted and used in hot
coffee-like beverages. Although the use of its roots
was displaced by genuine coffee from Coffea arabica,
sprouts of chicory var foliosum that are grown in the
dark became popular as a vegetable (Belgian endive)
halfway through the nineteenth century. Nowadays
it is a common crop in Belgium, northern France, and
The Netherlands (Weeda et al., 1991; Vogel et al.,
1996). The bitter taste of chicory is associated with the
presence of sesquiterpene lactones, in particular the
guaianolides lactucin (1) (Fig. 1), 8-deoxylactucin (2),
and lactupicrin (3). Smaller amounts of eudesmano-
lides and germacranolides are also present in the
plant (Pyrek, 1985; Seto et al., 1988; Price et al., 1990;
van Beek et al., 1990).
Sesquiterpene lactones are a major class of plant
secondary metabolites and over 4,000 different struc-
tures have been elucidated. A wealth of information
is available about the structural aspects and biologi-
cal activities of these type of compounds (e.g. Pic-
man, 1986), but little is known about their biosynthe-
sis. By far the largest group of naturally occurring
sesquiterpene lactones is the germacranolides, and
the majority of sesquiterpene lactones are thought to
evolve from this class. The simplest member of the
germacranolides (1)-costunolide (12) (Fig. 2) is gen-
erally accepted as the common intermediate of all
germacranolide-derived lactones (Geissman, 1973;
Herz, 1977; Fischer et al., 1979; Seaman, 1982; Song et
al., 1995).
(1)-Costunolide was first isolated from costus
(Saussurea lappa Clarke) roots by Paul et al. (1960) and
Somasekar Rao et al. (1960), and has since been found
with other sesquiterpene lactones in various plants
(Fischer et al., 1979). Among them is lettuce, a species
that is closely related to chicory and also contains the
bitter tasting compounds lactucin (1) and lactupicrin
(3) (Takasugi et al., 1985; Price et al., 1990).
We have recently demonstrated that the sesquiter-
penoid backbone of the sesquiterpene lactones in
chicory is formed by a (1)-germacrene A synthase,
which cyclizes farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to
(1)-germacrene A (8) (Fig. 2; de Kraker et al., 1998).
This (1)-germacrene A is not further transformed
into a guaiane or an eudesmane, indicating that func-
tionalization of the molecule precedes its cyclization.

Studies on the biosynthesis of santonin (Barton et al.,
1968) suggested that lactone formation precedes any
other oxidation of the sesquiterpenoid ring system
(Cordell, 1976), and various authors have proposed a
biosynthetic route (Fig. 2) from (1)-germacrene A (8)
toward (1)-costunolide (12) (Geissman, 1973; Herz,
1977; Seaman, 1982; Fischer, 1990; Song et al., 1995).
In this hypothetical route (1)-germacrene A (8) is
hydroxylated to germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol
(9), which is further oxidized via germacra-1(10),4,
11(13)-trien-12-al (10) to germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-
12-oic acid (11). The germacrene acid is thought to be
hydroxylated at the C6-position and subsequent loss
of water leads to the formation of a lactone ring such
as present in (1)-costunolide (12).
However, germacrenes are notoriously unstable
compounds, susceptible to proton-induced cycliza-
tions and heat-induced (e.g. steam distillation and
gas chromatography [GC] analysis) Cope rearrange-
ment (Takeda, 1974; Bohlman et al., 1983; Reichardt
et al., 1988; Teisseire, 1994; de Kraker et al., 1998).
None of the intermediates between (1)-germacrene
A and (1)-costunolide has ever been isolated, apart
from germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-al (10), which
was isolated with greatest difficulty from Vernonia
glabra and could not be separated from its cyclization
product costal (20) (Bohlman et al., 1983). Most likely
as a result of this instability, the hypothetical biosyn-
thetic route for (1)-costunolide has merely been
based on the isolation from costus roots of the Cope-
rearrangement products (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-
12-ol (14) and (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15),
and the proton-induced cyclization products costol
(19), costal (20), and costic acid (21) (Bawdekar and
Kelkar, 1965; Bawdekar et al., 1967; Maurer and
Grieder, 1977). Besides the reported (1)-germacrene
A synthase from chicory roots (de Kraker et al., 1998),
thus far no other enzyme has been isolated that might
be involved in this proposed pathway from FPP to
(1)-costunolide.
The aim of the present research was to find en-
zymes in chicory that are involved in oxidation of the
germacrene A isopropenyl side chain, and thus to
investigate the initial steps in the formation of the
lactone ring, as present in (1)-costunolide and other
germacrene-derived sesquiterpene lactones.
RESULTS
Demonstration of (1)-Germacrene A
Hydroxylase Activity
Radio-GC analysis of the pentane-ether extract
from the incubation of a 20,000g chicory root super-
natant with [3H]FPP revealed a peak of germacrene A
as a result of the (1)-germacrene A synthase present
in the supernatant (Fig. 3A). In the presence of
NADPH, 60% of the (1)-germacrene A was con-
verted into a more polar compound that eluted from
the GC column at a higher temperature (Fig. 3B). In
Figure 1. The major sesquiterpene lactones of chicory: the guaiano-
lides lactucin (1), 8-deoxylactucin (2), and lactupicrin (3); the eudes-
manolides sonchuside C (4) and cichoriolide A (5); and the germac-
ranolides sonchuside A (6) and cichorioside C (7).
Figure 2. Proposed biosynthetic route from (1)-germacrene A (8) to
(1)-costunolide (12) via germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9),
germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-al (10), and germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-
trien-12-oic acid (11). At the right side of the dotted line, compounds are
shown that can be formed from these unstable germacrenes: the heat-
induced Cope-rearrangement products (-)-b-elemene (13), (-)-elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14), (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15), elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (16), and dehydrosaussurea lactone (17);
and the acid-induced cyclization products selinene (18) (g-selinene is
usually named selina-4, 11-diene), costol (19), costal (20), and costic
acid (21). Compounds with underlined numbers have all been identified
in costus roots; (1)-germacrene A (8) and germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-
12-al (10) were isolated from other plant species. Note that after hy-
droxylation the numbering of carbon atoms 12 and 13 is inverted.

both incubations a small amount of farnesol was also
formed due to non-specific phosphohydrolases, but it
was efficiently reduced by the addition of 6 mm
sodium orthovanadate to the assay buffer (Croteau
and Karp, 1974). Farnesol formation decreased even
further in the presence of the NADPH-regenerating
system, likely because Glc-6-P (1 mm) acts as a com-
petitive inhibitor on the phosphohydrolases.
In a GC-mass spectrometry (MS) measurement at
an injection port temperature of 250°C, germacrene A
was detected as its Cope-rearrangement product
b-elemene (13). The unknown product was displayed
as a sharp peak with the same retention time and
mass spectrum as (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14),
the Cope-rearrangement product of germacra-
1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9). Lowering the injection
port temperature to 150°C yielded the slightly front-
ing peak of germacrene A (de Kraker et al., 1998), but
the peak of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol was replaced
by a broad “hump” in the baseline that started at the
position of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol and stretched
over a 2-min period. If the germacrene alcohol is not
rearranged in the injection port, it apparently rear-
ranges during migration through the GC column
(HP5-MS) to the faster migrating elema-1,3,11(13)-
trien-12-ol and is observed as a broad peak similar to
the one described for 7-hydroxygermacrene (Stahl,
1984). Germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol is also ex-
pected to rearrange on the column of the radio GC
(cold on column injection), but was nevertheless de-
tected as a somewhat broadened peak that co-elutes
with a standard of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (Fig. 3,
B and C). It seems that on the Carbowax column of
the radio GC there is only little difference in retention
time between the elemene and germacrene alcohol.
Considerable amounts of costol (19) were detected
when, during the extraction-filtration procedure, alu-
minum oxide was replaced by silica gel and larger

amounts of MgSO4 were used (data not shown).
Costol is the acid-induced cyclization product of
germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol, just as costal (20) is
derived from germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-al (10)
(Bohlman et al., 1983). Its observation confirms the
conclusion that (1)-germacrene A is enzymatically
converted into the somewhat unstable germacra-
1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol. Further oxidation of the ger-
macrene alcohol was not observed in any of the
(1)-germacrene A hydroxylase assays.
Sesquiterpenoid Dehydrogenase Activities
Incubations of (-)-Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) and
(-)-Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15)
(-)-Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) (100 mm) was
converted into elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (16)
by a 20,000g chicory root supernatant in the presence
of NADP1 at pH 10 (Fig. 4, B and D). This reaction
did not take place in the presence of NAD1 or with-
out cofactor (Fig. 4A). After centrifugation at
200,000g, dehydrogenase activity was retained in the
supernatant, showing that it originates from soluble
enzyme(s). Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15) was only
detected in minute quantities, which might be ex-
plained by the chemical reactivity of the isopropenal
side chain. Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al added in 10
mm concentration to a solution of 0.5 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin (a protein concentration similar to the
supernatant) or 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was only
extractable for 20% to 50% in comparison with equal
amounts of elematrien-12-al that had been added to
demineralized water. DTT could, however, not be
omitted from the assay buffer, since no dehydroge-
nase activity was detected in its absence consistent
with the literature about dehydrogenases (Kjonaas et
al., 1985; Ikeda et al., 1991).
(-)-Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15) (200 mm) was
oxidized to elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid most
effectively in the presence of NAD1 (Fig. 4C),
whereas a smaller aldehyde dehydrogenase activity
(#15% of maximum activity) was detected in the
presence of NADP1 or absence of any cofactor.
Boiled controls showed no conversion at all. Enzyme
activity without cofactor has also been observed for
the abietadienal dehydrogenase of grand fir (Funk
and Croteau, 1994).
Incubation of [3H]Germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9)
Incubation of [3H]germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-
ol (9) with the 20,000g supernatant and NADP1
showed a new broadened peak in the [3H]trace of the
radio GC, whose front co-elutes with a standard of
elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (16) (Fig. 5). During
GC-MS analysis a small peak was detected with the
mass spectrum and retention time of elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid. This peak should result
from Cope rearrangement of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-
trien-12-oic acid (11) in the GC-MS injection port.
Formation of the germacrene/elemene aldehyde was
not detected.
Characterization of the (1)-Germacrene A Hydroxylase
Hydroxylation of (1)-germacrene A was optimal at
a pH of 8.0 with 60% of maximal enzyme activity at
pH 7.5 and 9.0 (no difference in activity between
Bis-Tris and Tris). The reaction required NADPH.
NADH was less effective as a reductant (Table I). The
combination of both cofactors showed an additive

20,000g supernatant from chicory roots incubated with (-)-elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) (EOL) in the absence (A) or presence of
NADP1 (B); or with (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15) (EAL) and
NAD1 (C). The produced elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (16)
(EAc) has the same retention time as the synthesized standard (D).

effect, which is not uncommon for plant cytochrome
P450 systems and is believed to result from the par-
ticipation of NADH:cytochrome b reductase and
NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase in electron
transfer to cytochrome P450 (West, 1980; Funk and
Croteau, 1994). Flushing the reaction mixture for 1.5
min with Argon prior to incubation caused a 69%
decrease of enzyme activity because of O2 depletion.
An assay buffer without flavins (flavin adenine dinu-
cleotide [FAD] and flavin mononucleotide [FMN])
gave 18% loss of hydroxylase activity; however,
omitting these flavins from the extraction buffer re-
sulted in a loss of more than 70% in enzyme activity
(data not shown).
The results described above and the observation
that the enzyme activity resided in the 150,000g pellet
support the involvement of a cytochrome P450 en-
zyme in the hydroxylation of (1)-germacrene A. This
was confirmed by the effect of cytochrome P450 in-
hibitors on (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase activity:
cytochrome C (100 mm) caused 97% inhibition; mi-
conazole (100 mm) caused 30% inhibition; aminoben-
zotriazole (100 mm) 26% inhibition; metyrapone (1
mm) caused 23% inhibition; and clotrimazole (100
mm) caused 16% inhibition. Somewhat unexpectedly,
all of them except cytochrome C could inhibit
(1)-germacrene A synthase activity as well.
The strongest proof for the involvement of a cyto-
chrome P450 enzyme is blue-light reversible inhibi-
tion of enzyme activity by CO (West, 1980; Mihaliak
et al., 1993). An atmosphere of 80% CO 1 20% O2
inhibits (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase by 69% (Ta-
ble II). The corresponding decrease of the elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol peak was accompanied by an
increase in the GC-MS peak size of b-elemene, be-
cause the production of (1)-germacrene A from FPP
was not affected by CO. The inhibitory effect of CO
on (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase activity could be
convincingly reversed by blue light (450 nm).

(1)-germacrene A hydroxylase assay reduced the
conversion of [3H]germacrene A into [3H]germa-
cratrien-12-ol with 37%. This substrate competition
shows that both hydroxylations are most likely cata-
lyzed by the same enzyme, so b-elemene can be used
to investigate the enantioselectivity of the (1)-germa-
crene A hydroxylase. The amount of (1)-b-elemene
hydroxylated was only two times less than that
of (-)-b-elemene (Fig. 6), the structural analog of
(1)-germacrene A. This indicates a modest enantiose-
lectivity of the (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase.
DISCUSSION
The present results have established the pathway
for biosynthesis in chicory roots of germacra-
1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (11), a compound en
route to the germacrene-derived sesquiterpene lac-
tones. The reported oxidation of the (1)-germacrene
A isopropenyl side chain supports the hypothesis
that formation of the lactone ring precedes any
cyclization or other oxidation of the germacrene
framework (Cordell 1976; de Kraker et al., 1998).
Formation of (1)-costunolide (12) itself has not yet
been demonstrated, but the results presented are in
line with the proposed pathway for this germacrano-
lide, which is structurally most closely related to
(1)-germacrene A (Geissman, 1973; Herz, 1977; Fi-
scher et al., 1979; Seaman, 1982; Song et al., 1995).
The biosynthesis of germacrene-derived sesquit-
erpene lactones (Fig. 7) starts with the cyclization of
FPP into (1)-germacrene A (8) by a sesquiterpene
cyclase (reaction I; de Kraker et al., 1998). In the next
step (reaction II), the isopropenyl side chain of this
(1)-germacrene A (8) is subjected to a hydroxy-
lation reaction, resulting in the formation of
germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9). This sesquit-
erpene alcohol is visible as its Cope-rearrangement
product (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) in GC-MS
measurements at high injection port temperatures,
and it is detected as costol (19) when extracted under
acidic conditions. The involvement of a cytochrome
P450 enzyme in this membrane-bound hydroxylation
reaction is clearly demonstrated by its NADPH and O2
dependence, by the blue-light reversible inhibition by
CO, and by the inhibitory effect of various established
cytochrome P450 inhibitors (West, 1980; Mihaliak et
al., 1993).
The conversion of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-
12-ol (9) into germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic
acid (11) (Fig. 7; reaction III) is catalyzed by water-
soluble pyridine nucleotide dependent dehydroge-
nase(s). This enzyme activity oxidizes germacrene

alcohol (9) as well as (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol
(14) to their corresponding acids (11 and 16) solely in
the presence of NADP1. Because two hydrides have
to be abstracted to obtain the acid, we assume that
the stoichiometry is two NADP1 molecules for each
molecule of germacrene/elemene acid formed. Since
we worked with a root crude extract it is uncertain
whether formation of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-
12-oic acid (11) from the germacrene alcohol is cata-
lyzed by one or more dehydrogenase(s), and whether
oxidation occurs via germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-
12-al (10) or within one enzymatic step. The aldehyde
was not detected in incubations with the germacrene
alcohol and only in trace amounts in incubations
with the elemene alcohol. A study of the oxidation of
perilla alcohol to perillic acid by bacterial extracts
(Dhavalikar et al., 1966) could not demonstrate the
presence of the expected aldehyde intermediate ei-
ther. Isopropenal side chains are sensitive toward
nucleophilic attack, and both proteins and DTT were
demonstrated to “bind” elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al
(15). It could be a reason why these aldehydes are not
or hardly detectable in enzyme assays. Despite all of
that, enzymatic oxidation of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-
12-al (15) to the elemene acid (16) could be estab-
lished with the chicory root supernatant, but strik-
ingly, NAD1 was preferred over NADP1 and some
conversion occurred also in the absence of any
cofactor.
Neither germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid
(11) nor elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid (16) has
ever been isolated from a natural source (Bucking-
ham, 1999), but we managed to detect a small
amount of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid in costus
resinoid with the help of the chemically produced
standard (J.-W. de Kraker, unpublished data). In gen-
eral, cyclic mono- and sesquiterpenoid acids are
rather uncommon in plants (Bauer et al., 1990) and
little is known about their biosynthesis.
The established pathway for germacrene A carbox-
ylic acid resembles the biodegradation of limonene
via perillic acid in bacteria (Dhavalikar et al., 1966)
and the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid aldehydes/
ketones in plants (e.g. McConkey et al., 2000), but
with regard to the dehydrogenases it differs from the
diterpenoid pathways of kaurenoic and abietic acid
(Funk and Croteau, 1994). We assume that in the
biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene endoperoxide arte-
misinin by Artemisia annua oxidation of the isoprope-
nyl side chain of amorphadiene is catalyzed in the
same way as the oxidation of (1)-germacrene A to
germacrene acid (Bouwmeester et al., 1999).
Cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in plant
terpenoid secondary metabolism are known to be
rather substrate specific (West, 1980; Mihaliak et al.,
1993). Nevertheless, b-elemene (13) is hydroxylated
by the (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase of chicory
and competitively inhibits the hydroxylation of
(1)-germacrene A, probably because of the strong
similarity in three-dimensional structure between
(1)-germacrene A and b-elemene (Fig. 8). b-Elemene
contains two isopropenyl side chains, but its hy-
droxylation is regioselective and only elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) is formed. When the C13-
containing isopropenyl tails of the b-elemene

enantiomers are depicted in the same way (Fig. 8),
there are no evident differences at the side of
hydroxylation and the enzyme only shows a modest
degree of enantioselectivity toward these enanti-
omers. A similar degree of enantioselectivity is
also observed for the hydroxylation of limonene in
peppermint (C3), spearmint (C6), and perilla (C7;
Karp et al., 1990), though the limonene C6-
hydroxylase in caraway has a 10-fold preference for
the (1)-enantiomer (Bouwmeester et al., 1998). The
modest enantioselectivity of the (1)-germacrene A
hydroxylase has no influence on the stereochemistry
of the sesquiterpene lactones present in chicory, as in
vivo only (1)-germacrene A is offered to the enzyme
(de Kraker et al., 1998).
In general, all guaianolides, eudesmanolides,
and germacranolides are thought to origin from
(1)-costunolide (12) (Fischer, 1990; Fig. 7; reaction V)
and the same holds true for the bitter sesquiterpene
lactones of chicory. Formation of (1)-costunolide
from germacrene acid (11) involves a C6-hydroxy-
lation, after which formation of the lactone ring can be
completed (reaction IV). This probably cytochrome
P450 catalyzed step is currently under investigation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Fresh roots of cultivated chicory (Cichorium intybus L.
cv Focus) harvested during late summer were obtained
from a grower in Veenendaal, The Netherlands. The chic-
ory roots were cut into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitro-
gen, and were stored at 280°C. An FPP solution was
obtained from Sigma (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and
was concentrated to 10 mm (de Kraker et al., 1998);
[1-3H]FPP (16.0 Ci mmol21, 200 mCi mL21) was obtained
from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). trans,trans-
Farnesol, cis-nerolidol, and trans-caryophyllene were pur-
chased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). (6)-b-Elemene
and (-)-b-elemene (13) were a gift from Prof. Dr. W.A.
Ko¨nig (Hamburg University, Germany). (-)-Elema-
1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14) was a gift from Dr. B. Maurer
(Firmenich SA, Geneva). Spectra and retention times of
costol (19) were recorded from costus root oil (Pierre Chau-
vet SA, Seillans, France; Maurer and Grieder, 1977). Ether
(diethyl ether) and pentane were redistilled before use.
Preparation of Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic Acid (16)
(-)-Elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15) necessary for the
synthesis of elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid was isolated
from 5 g of costus root oil that had been stirred twice for 6 h
with 10 g of MnO2 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 100 mL
of pentane. The aldehydes and ketones were extracted
from the oil with 3 g of Girard P and were separated by
column chromatography as described by Maurer and
Grieder (1977). It yielded 13 mg of (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-
trien-12-al (15), 15 mg of b-costal (20), 22 mg of a a/g-costal
mixture (20), and smaller amounts of trans-bergamota-2,12-
dienal and ionone. To obtain elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic
acid (16), 2 mg of the corresponding aldehyde was dis-
solved in 1.2 mL of tert-butyl alcohol and 0.3 mL of
2-methyl-2-butene to which 0.5 mL of a solution of sodium
dihydrogen phosphate and sodium chlorite (0.1 g mL21
each) was carefully added (Balkrishna et al., 1981). The
mixture was vigorously shaken overnight at room temper-
ature. Volatile components were afterward removed under
vacuum and the residue was dissolved in 1.5 mL of demin-
eralized water and 20 mL of 2-methyl-2-butene. On ice, the
aqueous layer was acidified with 20 mL of 5 m HCl to pH
3 and was quickly extracted with four portions of 1.5 mL of
ether. The combined ether layers were washed with 1 mL
of cold demineralized water and were dried with MgSO4.
After removal of ether, elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid
(16) was obtained as a white powder (1.5 mg). 1H-Nuclear

Enzyme Isolation and Assay for (1)-Germacrene A
Hydroxylase Activity
We prepared a cell-free extract of chicory roots that
contained the sesquiterpene synthase (germacrene A syn-
thase) and the microsomal-bound cytochrome P450 en-
zymes (e.g. sesquiterpene hydroxylases), similar to the ap-
proach of Threlfall and Whitehead (1988) that had
demonstrated hydroxylation of 5-epi-aristolochene in to-
bacco (Whitehead et al., 1989). Twenty-five grams of frozen
root material was homogenized in a Sorvall Omni-mixer
(Newtown, CT) with 2.5 g of insoluble polyvinylpolypyr-
rolidone and 40 mL of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH
7.5), 50 mm sodium meta-bisulfite, 50 mm ascorbic acid, 10
mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA (disodium), 5 mm
FAD, 5 mm FMN, and 20% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A). The
slurry was filtered through pre-moistened cheesecloth with
an additional 10 mL of buffer and was centrifuged for 20
min at 20,000g at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through
rough glass wool and was desalted with an Econo-Pac
10Dg column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to buffer B. This
buffer contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm
DTT, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 5 mm FAD, 5 mm FMN, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, and 6 mm sodium orthovanadate to suppress
phosphohydrolase activity (Croteau and Karp, 1979). A
1-mL aliquot of the desalted supernatant was incubated
with 20 mm [3H]FPP (50 Ci mol21) for 1 h at 30°C in the

absence or presence of an NADPH-regenerating system.
The NADPH-regenerating system consisted of 1 mm
NADPH, 5 mm Glc-6-P, and 1.2 IU Glc-6-P dehydrogenase
(all from Sigma).
After incubation the assay was extracted twice with 1
mL of 20% (v/v) ether in pentane and the organic phase
was filtered through a glasswool-plugged (dimethyl
chlorosilane-treated glasswool; Chrompack, Bergen op
Zoom, The Netherlands) Pasteur pipette that contained
0.90 g of aluminum oxide (grade III) and a little anhy-
drous MgSO4. The column was washed with 1.5 mL of
ether and the extract was carefully concentrated to ap-
proximately 50 mL under a stream of nitrogen. Samples of
1 mL were analyzed by radio GC and GC-MS. Radio-GC
analyses was achieved by cold on column injection ac-
cording to Bouwmeester et al. (1999), using a final oven
temperature of 240°C. Signals of the FID and radioactivity
detector were synchronized with [3H]farnesol (a gift of dr.
E. Wallaart, University of Groningen). GC-MS analysis
was essentially carried out as before (de Kraker et al.,
1998) at an injection port temperature of 250°C and an
oven programmed for 4 min at 55°C followed by a ramp
of 5°C to 280°C.
Assay for Sesquiterpenoid Dehydrogenase Activities
The involvement of dehydrogenases in the oxidation of
germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9) was initially investi-
gated with (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-ol (14). A 20,000g
supernatant was prepared as described above, but MgCl2,
EDTA, and flavins were omitted from buffer A. The super-
natant was desalted to buffer C containing 25 mm Gly (pH
10.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mm DTT (Bouwmeester et
al., 1998). Aliquots of 1 mL were incubated at 30°C with 100
mm of substrate and 1 mm NAD1, 1 mm NADP1, or no
cofactor. Boiled controls were included. After 90 min, 20
mm cis-nerolidol was added as internal standard and each
incubation was acidified with 20 mL of 5 m HCl. The
incubation mixture was extracted three times with 1 mL of
ether and the combined ether layers were filtered through
a Pasteur pipette that contained 0.45 g of silica and a little
anhydrous MgSO4. The pipette was rinsed with 1 mL of
ether and the extract was concentrated to approximately
150 mL and analyzed by GC-MS. Experiments were re-
peated with 200 mm of (-)-elema-1,3,11(13)-trien-12-al (15).
[3H]Germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-ol (9) was pro-
duced in (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase assays that con-
sisted of 1.5 mL of supernatant and 50 mm [3H]FPP (40 Ci
mol21). The pentane-ether extracts of two of such assays
were combined, concentrated to approximately 10 mL, and
added to one dehydrogenase assay. After incubation, the
reaction mixture was carefully acidified with 0.5 m HCl to
pH 3 and extracted with ether. The extract was concen-
trated to approximately 50 mL and was analyzed by radio
GC and GC-MS.
Characterization of the (1)-Germacrene A Hydroxylase
(1)-Germacrene A (8) necessary for characterization of
the (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase was produced in
1.5-mL enzyme assays consisting of 150,000g supernatant,
50 mm FPP (de Kraker et al., 1998), and an additional 6 mm
sodium orthovanadate. The pentane-ether extracts of sev-
eral of these incubations were combined and the volume
was carefully reduced under a flow of nitrogen. The con-
centration of (1)-germacrene A was estimated by compar-
ison with a 10 mm trans-caryophyllene solution using
GC-MS; in general, one incubation of 50 mm FPP with
150,000g supernatant would give sufficient substrate for
one hydroxylase experiment (approximately 10 mm germa-
crene A).
The optimum pH of the (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase
was determined by desalting the 20,000g supernatant to
buffer B without MgCl2, in which 25 mm Tris was replaced
by 50 mm Bis-Tris of pH 6.5 to 9.0 in 0.5-unit increments.
After 30 min of incubation 5 mm of cis-nerolidol was added
as internal standard and the incubation mixtures were
extracted and analyzed by GC-MS. Areas of the product
peak were compared with those of cis-nerolidol.
Inhibition of the (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase by es-
tablished cytochrome P450 inhibitors was demonstrated
with microsomal pellets. They were prepared by centrifu-
gation of 8 mL of 20,000g supernatant (without MgCl2) at
150,000g and stored at 280°C under argon. Before use the
pellets were resuspended in 2 mL of buffer B without
MgCl2, combined, and divided into 1-mL aliquots. Inhibi-
tors were dissolved in ethanol: clotrimazole (10 mm), mi-
conazole (10 mm), aminobenzotriazole (10 mm), and me-
tyrapone (100 mm); cytochrome C (10 mm) was dissolved in
buffer. Ten microliters of one of these solutions was added
to 1 mL of enzyme preparation 15 min prior to the addition
of (1)-germacrene A and NADPH-regenerating system,
after which the incubations were continued for 1 h. Inhib-
itory effects were expressed relative to a control for the
solvent, and each inhibitor was tested in duplicate.
For demonstration of blue-light reversible CO inhibi-
tion of (1)-germacrene A hydroxylase activity, a mixture
of 80% CO and 20% O2 was prepared from pure CO and
O2. In 4.5-mL septum-capped vials, 50 mm FPP and an
NADPH-regenerating system were added to 1 mL of
20,000g supernatant that had been desalted to buffer B
devoid of flavins. Reaction mixtures were slowly bubbled
with 50 mL of the gas mixture via a needle inserted
through the (vented) septum. CO-treated vials and non-
CO-treated control vials were incubated on a rotary
shaker in a climate chamber at 30°C in blue light or
protected from the light by aluminum foil. Blue light was
obtained by passing a beam of a 100 W H44GS-100 mer-
cury lamp (Sylvania, Winchester, KY; ballast no. 1A024,
Grainger, Morton Grove, IL) through a thin-layer chroma-
tography chamber (width of 7 cm) filled with a 10% (w/v)
CuSO4 solution (Karp et al., 1987). After 1 h of incubation,
5 mm cis-nerolidol was added as internal standard and the
assays were extracted and analyzed by GC-MS. Each
treatment was done in triplicate. In similar experiments
the effects of an Argon atmosphere, NADH, and the ab-
sence of flavins were tested on (1)-germacrene A hydrox-
ylase activity.

Enantioselectivity of the
(1)-Germacrene A Hydroxylase
The enantioselectivity of the (1)-germacrene A hydrox-
ylase was investigated with (-)-b-elemene (13) and (6)-b-
elemene, as we had no source of (-)-germacrene A at our
disposal. Aliquots of 1 mL of resuspended microsomal
pellet were incubated with 20 mm b-elemene in the pres-
ence or absence of an NADPH-regenerating system. Ex-
tracts of the enzyme assay were analyzed on an enantiose-
lective column (de Kraker et al., 1998) programmed at
45°for 4 min, a ramp of 2°C min21 to 170°C, and a final time
of 10 min; spectra were recorded in Scan mode and Se-
lected Ion Monitoring Mode (m/z 119, 121, 145, 147, and
189). In a separate experiment, 100 mm of (-)-b-elemene was
added to the standard germacrene A hydroxylase assay to
demonstrate whether it competed as a substrate with
[3H]germacrene A. Production of [3H]germacratrien-12-ol
was measured by radio CG and compared with that of
incubations where only 10 mL of ethanol (the solvent of
b-elemene) had been added.
