From the leaves of Vellozia candida Mikan (Velloziaceae) the new flavonol 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-
3,6-dimethoxy-8-methylflavone and its known 7-O-methyl derivative, 3’,4’,5-trihydroxy-3,6,7-
trimethoxy-8-methylflavone, were isolated and characterized by spectral data, including 2D NMR
and tandem mass spectrometry experiments. The 5-hydroxy-3,3’,4’,6,7-pentamethoxy-8-
methylflavone derivative was obtained by methylation with diazomethane.

Introduction
The flavonol aglycones constitute a very diverse group
of plant secondary metabolites. A number of these natural
products are lipophilic and may show close Rf -values in
TLC, with overlapping spots, making it impossible to
identify them in mixtures containing several related
components. A preliminary MS spectrum of a plant fraction
and/or crude extract, and also data from GC, HPLC, TMS
(Tandem Mass Spectrometry) can supply important
structural information on natural compounds and thereby
allow an optimization of the investigation and avoid
unnecessary isolation, especially of known compounds.
The Velloziaceae family contains C-methyl and C-
prenylated flavonoids which are relatively rare in nature.1,2
Recently, we applied high temperature high resolution gas
chromatography (HT-HRGC) coupled to mass spectrometry
(HT-HRGC-MS) in the prospection and identification of
the monoisoprenylated flavonol 3,5,4'-trimethoxy-3'-
hydroxy-6,7-(2"-isopropenyldihydrofuran)-flavone from
Vellozia graminifolia, and the importance of this technique
to determine the presence of lipophilic flavonols was
demonstrated.3
A previous phytochemical analysis of V. candida,
collected on the Corcovado mountain, in the city of Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, resulted in the identification of several
rosane diterpenoids,4,5 including a velloziolide with a new
skeleton6 and a bioactive seco-rosane.7 In this paper we
describe the characterization of the 8-C-methylated
flavonols 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3,6-dimethoxy-8-
methylflavone (1) and its known 7-O-methyl derivative,
3’,4’,5-trihydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxy-8-methylflavone (2),
isolated from a specimen of V. candida collected in Barra
da Tijuca, a coastal area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The
structural determination of these compounds as
components of a mixture was based on spectral data,
including 2D NMR techniques, such as heteronuclear
correlation 1H-13C-COSY-nJCH (n=1, HMQC = 1H-detected
Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence; n=2 and 3,
HMBC = 1H-detected Heteronuclear Multiple Bond
Connectivity) and tandem mass spectrometry, together
with chemical transformation and comparative analysis of

chemical shifts of previously reported analogous flavonols
isolated from the Velloziaceae family.8
Results and Discussion
Chromatography of the Et2O extract of V. candida on a
silica gel column yielded initially a fraction containing
aliphatic carboxylic acids and sterols, which were
characterized by GC/MS analysis (see Experimental). The
other fractions obtained from the same column were
combined on the basis of TLC comparison and
subsequently chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 to
give a mixture of two lipophilic flavonoids. This mixture
was subjected to methylation with diazomethane and
yielded 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'-pentamethoxy-8-methyl-
flavone (3) as the only product of known structure.
The mixture of flavonols 1 and 2 showed IR absorption
bands for a conjugated carbonyl group (ν
max
 1651 cm-1 ) and
for aromatic ring (ν
max
 1602 and 1559 cm-1). The comparative
analysis of the HBBD- and DEPT-13C NMR spectra was used
to recognize the number of signals corresponding to
quaternary, methine and methyl carbon atoms (Table 1).
The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals for aromatic
hydrogens H-2’, H-5’ and H-6’ in the B-ring of a 3’,4’-
disubstituted flavonoid, along with signals for methoxyl,
methyl and chelated hydroxyl groups (Table 1).
In accordance with the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data
of 1, the HMBC spectrum confirmed a completely
substituted A-ring through the heteronuclear long range
couplings via two (2JCH) and three (3JCH) bonds between
carbon atoms C-6 (δC 130.24) and hydrogens of both HO-
5 [δH 12.76, s; 3JCH] and MeO-6 [δH 3.94, s; 3JCH] groups, C-
9 (δC 149.50) and Me-8 [δH 2.31, s; 3JCH] and C-7 (δC

peak correlating the signals at δC 137.68 (C-3) and δH 3.84
(MeO-3) allowed location of the remaining methoxyl group
at C-3 of 2 (Table 1). The 13C chemical shifts of the methoxyl
groups at δC 60.36 (MeO-6) and 59.67 (MeO-3) are in
accordance with the location of these groups at sterically
hindered positions. Other heteronuclear long range spin-
spin interactions of hydrogen and carbon atoms are
summarized in Table 1.
The 1H NMR spectra (1D and 2D 1H-1H-COSY) showed
signals compatible with a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring
in flavonoids (1 and 2) based on the chemical shifts and
coupling constants for H-2’ [δH 7.74 (d, 2.0 Hz)], H-5’ [δH
6.98 (d, 8.5 Hz)] and H-6’ [δH 7.59 (dd, 2.0 and 8.5 Hz).
These assignments were confirmed by the chemical shifts
and multiplicities of the signals corresponding to C-1’ and
C-6’ and by heteronuclear correlations, observed in the
1Hx13C-COSY-nJCH NMR spectra, as shown in Table 1.
The electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrum at
collision energies of 10 eV and 20 eV of the mixture isolated
from V. candida shows peaks due to protonated molecular
ions ([M+H]+) for 1 (m/z 361, 1a) and for the related minor
8-C-methylated flavonol 2 (m/z 375, 2a) (Figure 1). The
difference of 14 daltons between the protonated molecular
ions [M+H]+ of 1 (m/z 361 [360+H]+) and 2 (375 [374+H]+)
was attributed to a biomethylation of one hydroxyl group
of 1 (dimethoxylated) to produce 2 (trimethoxylated). This
is in accordance with the selective methylation of the
mixture which afforded only one product containing a
chelated hydroxyl group at C-5 [δH 12.58 (s)], a relatively
strong intramolecular hydrogen bond involving a six-
membered ring.
In fact, the remaining signals observed in the 1H and
13C NMR spectra together with the results obtained from
heteronuclear 2D shift-correlated 1Hx13C-COSY-nJCH (n=1,
HMQC; n=2 and 3, HMBC) spectra (Table 1), allowed the
definition of the structure as 3’,4’,5-trihydroxy-3,6,7-
trimethoxy-8-methylflavone (2) for the minor component
present in the mixture. The HMBC spectrum revealed 2D
1H/13C multiple bond (2JCH and 3JCH) correlation between
carbon and hydrogen atoms (Table 1): a) C-6 (δC 135.77)
and both HO-5 [δH 12.67, s; 3JCH] and MeO-6 [δH 3.92, s;
3JCH]; b) C-9 (δC 149.07) and Me-8 [δH 2.34, s; 3JCH]; c) C-
7 (δC 156.74) and both Me-8 [2.34, s; 3JCH] and MeO-7 [δH
3.99, s; 3JCH]; d) C-3 (δC 137.91) and MeO-3 [δH 3.85, s;
3JCH]. Other heteronuclear long range spin-spin interactions
of hydrogen and carbon atoms are summarized in Table 1.
The prominent peak at m/z 137 observed in both mass
spectra obtained at 30 eV (1h/2h, 16 %/17 %) and 40 eV
(1h/2h, 60 %/75 %) was also used to confirm the pattern of
substitution in B ring as 3’,4’-dihydroxylated (0,2B+
fragments in Claeys’ nomenclature).9
Thus, the two 8C-methylated flavonols isolated as a
mixture from Vellozia candida were characterized as the
new flavonol 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3,6-dimethoxy-8-
methylflavone (1) and its known 7-O-methyl derivative,
3’,4’,5-trihydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxy-8-methylflavone (2).2
On the basis of intensity of the signals corresponding to
HO-5 [2/3: δH 12.76 (s, rel. int.=1.000)/12.67 (s, rel. int.=
0.376)] in the 1H NMR spectrum the percentages of 1
(72.7%) and 2 (27.3%) in the mixture were estimated.
Furthermore, the complete 1H and 13C chemical shift
assignments of 1 and 2 were also accomplished by
extensive NMR analysis (Table 1).
The CID spectra of 1a and 2a show peaks at m/z 345 (1)
and 359 (2), which were attributed to ionic fragments 1b
and 2b formed from quasimolecular ions by elimination
of one molecule of methane ([M+H]+ - 16 daltons),
consistent with literature data for 3-methoxy flavonoids.9
Thus, the CID spectra at collision energies of 10 and 20 eV
allowed the observation of peaks corresponding to
[M+H]+. At 30 and 40 eV these ionic species are absent
and the peaks observed can be used to determine the
fragmentation mechanisms for 1a and 2a in the mass
spectrum (Scheme 1).

fication of ions (such as those representing components in
complex mixture), proved to be a rapid and powerful
technique for the characterization of flavonoids.10
Structural information of the components of a sample may
be obtained by fragmentation of selected [M+H]+ in CID.
Conclusions
The flavonoid substitution patterns are useful in the
determination of the generic limits within the family
Velloziaceae.11 In the genus Vellozia it is common to find
flavonols with C-prenylation, 6-hydroxylation and C-
methylation which are rarely found in the other genera of
this family. In the case of V. candida Mikan, after the
characterization of the new 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3,6-
dimethoxy-8-methylflavone (1) by NMR spectroscopy
(Table 1), it was possible to recognize its known O-methyl
ether derivative (2) in the mixture with the aid of tandem
mass spectrometry.
Experimental
General
Column chromatography was performed with silica gel
60 (Merck 70-230 mesh). Merck silica gel F254 was used
for TLC plates and spots visualized by UV (254 and 360
nm). NMR spectra in CDCl3 solution were recorded at 300
MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C on a Bruker AC 300
spectrometer, TMS as internal standard or referenced to
the solvent signals CHCl3, at δH 7.25 and CHCl3, at δC
77.00. Samples were initially diluted in aqueous/
acetonitrile solution and subsequently with acetic acid to
provide solutions of 10 mM HOAc (50/50). The ESI/MS/

MS spectra were acquired using a Quattro II (MicroMass,
UK) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with
an electrospray ionization source. The spectra were
recorded and processed by MassLynx v. 3.2 software
(MicroMass, UK). The acquisitions were accomplished in
positive ion mode (ES+) from m/z 50 to 550 at 2 s/scan.
The cone voltage was 40V and source temperature
maintained at 100°C. Each sample was delivered to the
electrospray source through an infusion pump (Pump 22,
Harvard Apparatus, So. Natick, MA) at a flow rate of
10 µL min-1. The protonated molecule, [M+H]+, was
selected at Q1 as precursor ion, and product ion scans were
made at Q3, after collisionally induced dissociation at q2.
Argon was used as collision gas (Gas Cell pressure was
1.7x10-3 mBar) and different collision energies, from 10 to
40 eV, were applied.
Plant material
Vellozia candida Mikan was collected in Barra da
Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and identified by Prof.
Nanuza L. de Menezes of the Universidade de São Paulo
(USP), São Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen has been
deposited at the herbarium of the Instituto de Botânica of
USP.
Extraction and isolation
Dried and powdered leaves were extracted with ethyl
ether at room temperature. After concentration of the
solvent, under vacuum, an oily residue (6.9 g) was obtained.
This extract was re-dissolved in methanol, filtered to
remove waxes and evaporated at reduced pressure to yield
an oily material (3.6 g), which was chromatographed on a
silica gel column (45 g) with a gradient of EtOAc in hexane.
A total of 12 fractions of ca 100 mL each were collected
and combined on the basis of TLC comparison. Fraction
2, eluted with hexane/EtOAc (1:1) contained palmitic acid
(40 %), stearic acid (20 %), b-sitosterol (3 %) and
stigmasterol (12 %) which have been characterized through
fragmentation patterns obtained by HRGC-MS.12 Fractions
4, 5 and 6, eluted with EtOAc/MeOH (7:3 to 5:5), were
combined and chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20
column using methanol as eluent. Fractions 2-9 (15 mL
each) were again combined and rechromatographed on a
Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as eluent.
Fractions 2-6 (15 mL each) furnished a mixture of 1 and 2
as a yellow oil (19.6 mg).
