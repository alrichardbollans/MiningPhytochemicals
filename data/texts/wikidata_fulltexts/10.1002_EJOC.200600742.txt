SHORT COMMUNICATIONDOI: 10.1002/ejoc.200600742Uncommon 5-Methoxyisoflavans from Desmodium canumCláudia Sampaio de Andrade Lima,[a] Giovanni Zappia,[b] Giuliano Delle Monache,[c] andBruno Botta*[c]Keywords: Natural products / Oxygen heterocycles / Isoflavans / Desmodium canumBioactive minor components of the hexane extract of Desmo-dium canum root have been assigned the new structures 2–7 of complex isoflavans. Four of them contain the 6-methylgroup typical of the major isoflavanone plant constituentsand were named desmodians A–C and 3-hydroxydesmodianIntroductionA bioassay-directed fractionation of the root extract ofDesmodium canum resulted in the isolation of three new an-timicrobial isoflavanones from the CHCl3 fraction, such as1, with isoprenoid substituents either in ring A or B.[1a]Three further derivatives of 5,7,2,4-tetrahydroxy-6-meth-ylisoflavanone, featuring rearranged geranyl substituents inthe B ring were isolated from the same fraction.[1b] Thispaper deals with the isolation, from the bioactive hexaneextract, of six new isoflavans 2–7 (Figure 1) and the elucida-tion of their structures.Figure 1.

KGaA, 69451 Weinheim,Germany, 2006)Result and DiscussionFollowing our examination of the root components ofDesmodium canum we investigated the bioactive hexane ex-tract: together with the previously described isoflav-anones[1a] and common triterpenes, six new isoflavans wereisolated. All of the compounds featured a fully reduced het-erocyclic ring (UV: λmax = 280 nm) without carbonyl groups(IR: absence of a νCO absorption) as in a flavan or isoflavanskeleton. The typical resonances for the heterocyclic ring[2]and the signals for the prenyl substituents in the 1H- and13C NMR spectra (Tables S1, S2 and S3, see SupportingInformation) indicate that the metabolites are complex iso-flavans. As for other isoflavonoids, the mass spectra of thesecompounds were characterized (Scheme 1) by fragments (a,a + H, b) that were produced by a retro-Diels–Alder reac-tion and tropylium-like ions (c).[3] These ions include eitherthe A or B rings and are highly diagnostic for the substitu-tion pattern of the compounds. Moreover, the prenyl sub-stituent in complex isoflavonoids is responsible for a paral-lel fragmentation, which originates in most cases by the lossof a methyl group (15 mu) from the molecular ion.[1a,4] Theintensity of the [M – Me]+ ion and consequently the inten-sities of the retro-Diels–Alder fragments (a, b) depends onthe nature of the prenyl substituent. For instance, the lossof Me from a chromene ring, as in 2 and 3, gives a moreintense ion than [M]+,[5] whereas the same loss from an iso-propenylfuran ring yields a less intense fragment. TheEIMS spectra of isoflavans from Desmodium canum aresummarized in Table 1. The unambiguous identification ofthe fragments by high-resolution mass spectroscopy al-lowed the confirmation of the substitution pattern of the Aand B rings and to assign the correct structures.The 1H- and13C NMR spectra of 2 and 3 (Table S1) re-vealed the presence of two 2,2-dimethyl-2H-dihydropyranrings, one methoxy and one phenoxy group. The two 1HNMR spectra differ from one another by the presence ofC. S. de Andrade Lima, G. Zappia, G. D. Monache, B. BottaSHORT COMMUNICATIONScheme 1.

Chem. 2006, 5445–54485446ran rings, must be located on ring A, as suggested by themass fragmentation (vide supra); in particular, the differentvalues of the chemical shifts in the 13C NMR spectra clearlyindicate that the OMe group in 3 is ortho to the new methylgroup. Therefore, the substitution pattern of ring A in 3requires the methoxy group at C-5, the methyl group at C-6 and the pyran ring fused at 7-O and C-8. The seconddihydropyran ring and the phenolic group belong to ring B,again assigned from the mass fragmentation pattern. Thepresence of signals for the two ortho protons in both 1HNMR spectra and the resonances of the oxygenated aro-matic carbons in the 13C NMR spectra are in accordancewith a 2,4-dioxy substitution of ring B, with the dihy-dropyran ring fused at C-3. The free hydroxy group canbe located at either the 2- or 4-position, the latter beingsuggested by a negative Gibbs test.[6] In the carbon spec-trum of the methyl derivatives of 2 and 3, the new OMeresonance appeared at highfield (at δ = 55 ppm) and con-firmed the original 4-OH substitution. The two isoflavanswere thus assigned structures 2 and 3. On consideration ofthe isoflavanones previously isolated from Desmodiumcanum (desmodianones A–F), all of which contain a 6-methyl substituent, 3 and 2 were named desmodian A and6-desmethyldesmodian A, respectively.The A rings of isoflavans 4 and 5 both have a 5-methoxygroup and an isopropenyl dihydrofuran ring as substituents,but they differ in the presence, or lack thereof, of the 6-methyl group, as it was demonstrated for 2 and 3. The massfragmentation pattern (b, c and related ions) and the 1H-and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table S2) of 4 and 5reveal that the substitution pattern of the B rings is thesame as those of 2 and 3 and involves a methoxy and aphenolic hydroxy group located in the 2- and 4-positions,respectively. The relative positions (2-OMe and 4-OH)were assigned on the basis of the following considerations:(1) a negative Gibbs test: the position para to the hydroxygroup is not free,[6] (2) the H-3 signal appears in a highfieldUncommon 5-Methoxyisoflavans from Desmodium canum SHORT COMMUNICATIONenvironment in the 1H NMR spectrum relative to the H-5signal as in 2-OMe, 4-OMe[7] and 2-OMe, 4-OH[8] sub-stituted isoflavonoid B rings; the opposite is true for 2-OH,4-OH[7] and 2-OH, 4-OMe[9,10] substitutions, (3) compar-able shifts (+0.40 versus +0.38 ppm) were obtained in the1H NMR spectra in C5D5N for the H-3 and H-5 signals;the values are both typical of protons ortho to a free pheno-lic group,[11] (4) the C-3 resonance (at δ = 99 ppm) is inagreement with a 2-OMe, 4-OH substitution, whereas a2-OH, 4-OMe substitution would require a value of103 ppm.[8] Analogously C-1 appears at δ = 116 ppm (2-OH) instead of 120 ppm (2-OMe). The two metaboliteswere assigned structures 4 and 5, named 6-desmethyldes-modian B and desmodian B, respectively.The 1H- and 13C NMR (Table S3) and MS (Table 1)spectroscopic data require that compound 6 has the sameB ring as 4 and 5, the same 6-methyl in the A ring as 3 and5, but a 5-hydroxy instead of the 5-methoxyl group. Thissubstitution pattern was confirmed by methylation of 6with CH2N2, which gave the same final product of 5 in thereaction. Therefore, the compound was thus assigned struc-ture 6 and the name desmodian C.Conversely, compound 7 has the same A ring (the samea and a ions) and an extra hydroxy group in ring B (b andc ions shifted by 16 mu) as compared with isoflavan 5. Thepresence in the 1H NMR spectrum of signals for two orthocoupled protons (H-5 and H-6) and in the 13C NMR spec-trum of two resonances at ca. 60 ppm for two ortho disub-stituted methoxy groups require only two possible arrange-ments of ring B: the 3,4-dihydroxy-2-methoxy-substitu-tion pattern, suggested from the co-occurrence of 4–6 in-stead of the 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxy arrangement andwas confirmed by acetylation of 7. The downfield shift ofH-6 (δ =0.25 ppm) in the diacetyl derivative revealed thatthe second free hydroxy group was at the C-3 position. Inconclusion, the last metabolite was assigned structure 7,that is, 3-hydroxydesmodian B.Available CD and ORD data of isoflavans (reviewed byD. Slade et al.[12]) connect the signs of Cotton effects (CE)in the regions 260–320 nm and 220–260 nm with theabsolute configuration. The heterocyclic ring of isoflavans2 and 3 was assigned the (3S) configuration because of thepresence of a positive band at ca. 248 nm and a negativeband at ca. 293 nm. Compounds 4–7, also with the (3S)configuration, showed an additional curve, which was at-tributed to the presence of a second undefined chiral cen-tre.[13]While compounds 3 and 5–7 exhibit the rare 6-methylgroup, typical of the isoflavonoids that are isolated fromDesmodium canum, isoflavans 2–5 and 7 are the first to beisolated with a 5-OCH3 substituent.Experimental SectionGeneral Experimental Procedures: Melting points were determinedwith a Kofler apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 13C NMRspectra were determined with a Varian Gemini instrument and ref-Eur.
