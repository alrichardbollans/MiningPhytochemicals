INFORMATION TO USERS
This was produced from a copy of a document sent to us for microfilming. While the 
most advanced technological means to photograph and reproduce this document 
have been used, the quality is heavily dependent upon the quality of the material 
submitted.
The following explanation of techniques is provided to help you understand 
markings or notations which may appear on this reproduction.
1. The sign or “ target” for pages apparently lacking from the document 
photographed is “Missing Page(s)” . If it was possible to obtain the missing 
page(s) or section, they are spliced into the film along with adjacent pages. 
This may have necessitated cutting through an image and duplicating 
adjacent pages to assure you of complete continuity.
2. When an image on the film is obliterated with a round black mark it is an 
indication that the film inspector noticed either blurred copy because of 
movement during exposure, or duplicate copy. Unless we meant to delete 
copyrighted materials that should not have been filmed, you will find a 
good image of the page in the adjacent frame.
3. When a map, drawing or chart, etc., is part of the material being photo­
graphed the photographer has followed a definite method in “sectioning” 
the material. It is customary to begin filming at the upper left hand corner 
of a large sheet and to continue from left to right in equal sections with 
small overlaps. If necessary, sectioning is continued again—beginning 
below the first row and continuing on until complete.
4. For any illustrations that cannot be reproduced satisfactorily by 
xerography, photographic prints can be purchased at additional cost and 
tipped into your xerographic copy. Requests can be made to our 
Dissertations Customer Services Department.
5. Some pages in any document may have indistinct print. In all cases we 
have filmed the best available copy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I gratefully acknowledge the support, guidance, trust, and 
friendship of my major professor, Nikolaus H. Fischer. Throughout 
my course as a graduate student he has shown not only the patience 
but also the encouragement needed for the completion of my doctoral 
studies. I am especially thankful for the extra understanding and 
support offered me in past several months.
I also wish to thank my minor professor, Ezzat S. Younathan, 
without whose knowledge and expertise the phosphofructokinase work 
could not have been carried out.
The collection and identification of the various plants by 
Dr. Tod Stuessy and Dr. Lowell Urbatsch is greatly appreciated.
I would also like to thank my fellow farmers and Helga 
Fischer for their loyal support and friendship.
Lastly, I acknowledge the financial support received from 
the National Cancer Institute, the Louisiana State University 
Student Government Association, and Coates Memorial Foundation.

ABSTRACT
Investigations of the antineoplastic crude extracts of 
Melampodvum cineveum No. 2015B provided low yields of four new cis, 
cis-germacranolide sesquiterpene lactones which were named melcanthin 
D (83), E (84), F (87), and G (8 8). The separations of these closely 
related compounds were accomplished by reverse phase high pressure 
liquid chromatography. Structure elucidation of melcanthins D to G 
utilized infrared, ultraviolet, circular dichroism, mass, and proton 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods combined with 
spectral correlation with the known compound melcanthin A. Tentative 
configurational and conformational assignments were made by 
considering proton nuclear magnetic resonance coupling data and the 
dihedral angles from stereo models (Karplus correlation).
For structure-biological activity correlation studies 
(antineoplastic activity, cytotoxicity, and phosphofructokinase 
deactivation), acetate, isobutyrate, hexanoate, and palmitate ester 
derivatives were prepared of four melampolide-type sesquiterpene 
lactones from Melampod'ium'. melampodin B (86), melcanthin B (99), 
melampodin A (100), and cinerenin (101). The cinnamate of cinerenin 
was prepared, but attempts to prepare methacrylates of this series 
of melampolides by several methods failed.
xiv
Twenty-two melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones and their 
ester derivatives were tested for inhibition of the enzyme phospho­
fructokinase (PFK) and the apparent values were determined. All 
compounds showed considerable PFK inhibition. Within each series of 
ester derivatives, PFK inhibition was observed to increase with 
increasing chain length of the ester moiety, rising to maximum 
inhibition for hexanoate esters. Comparison of these and other 
structural variations with cytotoxicity and limited antineoplastic 
activity data (obtained under the auspices of the National Cancer 
Institute) indicated possible correlations between cytotoxicity and 
PFK inhibition, which could indicate that general cytotoxicity of 
these compounds is due to PFK deactivation. No correlation between 
antineoplastic activity and PFK inhibition was observed.

INTRODUCTION
From the brews administered by ancient medicine men to the
many antibiotics now prescribed daily by physicians, plants have
always played a large part in curative medicine. Research in the
field of pharmacognosy has certainly advanced greatly in the past
few decades, but this area still holds a wealth of information. The
following quotation written by Helen Abbott in 1887, has much yet to
say to today's phytochemists:^
The vegetable kingdom does not usually claim our attention 
for its intellectual attainments, although its members 
would certainly seem to possess greater chemical skill 
than a higher race of beings exhibits in laboratories.
Within the plant kingdom, the family Compositae contains many
different species that have been or are being used for medicinal 
2
purposes. Once chemical investigation had begun on the Compositae,
it was discovered that a characteristic group of compounds,
sesquiterpene lactones, commonly occurs in this plant family. Today,
more than one thousand sesquiterpene lactones have been isolated from
3
over 125 genera of the Compositae family.
Sesquiterpene lactones are compounds which contain fifteen
carbon atoms in an isoprenoid or modified isoprenoid structure. In
these compounds, the isopropyl side chain is modified so that the
A
oxidation state is that of a carboxylic acid. Sesquiterpene lactones
are divided into six major structural classes. The following is a
1
2brief description, with some typical examples, of these structural 
classes.
1. Germacranolides
The germacranolides are cyclodeca-l,5-dienes containing 
double bonds at the C-4,5 and C-l(lO) positions of the medium ring. 
Germacranolides can be lactonized toward carbon atom six or eight. A 
basic germacranolide skeleton (1) with the conventional numbering 
pattern is shown below. There are four major subgroups within
( I )2
3
this class of sesquiterpene lactones, defined by the stereochemistry 
of the two double bonds.
a. The germacrolides contain trans double bonds at both C-4,5 
and C-l(lO) positions. Tulipinolide (2)^is a typical member of this
( 2 )
largest subgroup of germacranolides.
b. Melampolldes contain a cis-l(lO) double bond and a trans- 
4,5 double bond. A typical example from this subgroup is 
melampolidin (3).^
OAcOMe O
(3)
c. A trans-1 (10) double bond and a cis-4 ,5 double bond 
characterize the subgroup heliangolides, which are represented by 
eupaformonin (4).^
OH
d. The last subgroup of the germacranolides is typified by 
cis double bonds at both C-l(10) and C-4,5 positions. Until recently, 
there were no known naturally occurring members of this subgroup. But
g
the discovery of cis,cis-3-acetoxy-8-hydroxycostunolide (5) 
established their existence.

2. Guaianolides
9
Graminiliatrin (6) is a member of another structural class
of sesquiterpene lactones known as the guaianolides. The guaianolides
contain a 5,7-ring system that is based on the guaiane skeleton.
Together with the seco-guaianolides (xanthanolides), the guaianolides
3
comprise over two hundred naturally occurring compounds. The 
majority of guaianolides are lactonized towards carbon six, although 
it is not uncommon to find C-7,8 lactones.
lactones. Like the guaianolides, the pseudoguaianolides contain a 
5,7-ring system. However, unlike the guaianolides, they contain a
(§)
o
3. Pseudoguaianolides
The pseudoguaianolides comprise a large class of sesquiterpene
5methyl group at the C-5 Instead of the C-4 position. Again, lactone 
formation may occur at C-6 or C-8 . The pseudoguaianolides can be 
divided into two major subgroups based upon the stereochemistry about 
carbon atom ten.
a. Helenanolides represent pseudoguaianolides possessing the 
C-10 methyl group in an alpha-orientation. An example from this sub­
group is pulchellin (7)."^
OH
Hi m
OH
(7)
b. Pseudoguaianolides with the C-10 methyl group in a beta- 
orientation are placed in the subgroup ambrosanolides. Damsin (8) ^
(8)
is a representative of this subgroup.
4. Eudesmanolides
The eudesmanolides are characterized by a 6 ,6-fused ring 
system based on the eudesmane skeleton. Normally the ring fusion is
612
trans, as is seen in ludalbin (9). Eudesmanolides contain either
2
3
13
(§)
trans-7,6-lactones or 7,8-lactones that may occur as either cis or 
trans-y-lactones.
5. Eremophilanolides
The structural class known as the eremophilanolides is defined
by the absence of the C-10 methyl group in the eudesmanolides and the
.13presence of a methyl group at C-5. Xanthanene (10)' 
eremophilanolide.
is a typical
(to)
6 . Elemanolides
Elemanolides are structurally based on the elemol skeleton.
It has been suggested that this class of sesquiterpene lactones
represented artifacts of germacranolides produced during the isolation
14
of these natural products. But the existence of more complex
7elemanolides, such as vernmenin (11) proved that not all such 
compounds are artifacts.
7. Biosynthesis of Sesquiterpene Lactones
Many excellent reviews have recently appeared dealing with
3 16-22
the biosynthesis of the various classes of sesquiterpene lactones. ’
Although the central role of mevalonic acid (12) in the biosynthesis
of terpenoid and steroidal compounds has been realized for many 
23-25years, the elucidation of detailed pathways of formation of these
compounds has been quite elusive. This difficulty has been due, at 
least in part, to the fact that traditional radiolabeling experiments 
are not successful in higher plants. At best, one can usually expect 
no more than 1-2% incorporation of radioactivity. However, recent
data of labeling experiments involving vitamin precursors have
13 26
yielded, with the aid of C NMR, very promising results.
The formation of trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate (13)
from mevalonic acid, and its subsequent cyclization to the trans-
germacradiene intermediate (14) are shown in Scheme I. Biogenetically,
all of the various structural classes of sesquiterpene lactones can be

9derived from a trans-germacradiene structure such as (14). Through 
loss of a proton, the germacradiene intermediate (14) can lead to the 
formation of the common volatile sesquiterpenes germacrene A (15) and/ 
or germacrene B (16). From these germacradienes, two biogenetic routes
2
3
(15)
3 4
have been suggested for the formation of the lactone ring. * Using 
germacrene A, the introduction of an oxygen function at the allylically 
active C-12 position of (15) could proceed through either an epoxide 
intermediate (17) or a hydroperoxide intermediate such as (18). As 
seen in Scheme II, these two different routes will lead to different 
products if formation of the hydroperoxide were to occur via a radical 
process. Biogenetically, the hydroperoxide route will lead to a C-12 
alcohol (19) under retention of the 11,13 double bond, whereas the 
epoxide route will lead to a C-13 alcohol (20) with formation of an 
11,12 double bond. Further oxidation of the alcohol (19) to the 
aldehyde (21) and the acid (22), followed by the allylic oxidation of 
the C-6 position and the formation of the lactone would lead to the 
germacranolide costunolide (23).

Examination of the germacrene A structure reveals that all
of the non-olefinic carbons are allylically activated for oxidation,
with the exception of carbon eight. Thus it is possible for all of
these activated carbons to become further oxidized, thereby accounting
for the many different side chains encountered in sesquiterpene
lactones. Oxidation at C-8 follows from germacrene B in which C-8 is
allylically activated.
Scheme III demonstrates some general routes in which one
structural class of sesquiterpene lactone converts to another. The
germacranolides are believed to be the parent class from which all
the other classes are then derived, either directly or indirectly.
It has been postulated that the elemanolides are formed from the
germacranolides via a biogenetic Cope rearrangement as seen in Scheme
27
IV. Recently, Bohlmann and Zdero observed a spontaneous Cope

rearrangement that took place at temperatures below 60°C (Scheme V). 
Of particular note was their observation that the alcohols (25) and
(26) required temperatures above 100°C for the Cope rearrangement, 
whereas the aldehyde (2£) rearranged below 60°C to yield the product

(27). The aldehyde group in compound (24) may play a crucial role in
28
this spontaneous process, as predicted by theoretical calculations. 
Eudesmanolides have been synthesized in vitro from epoxy-
germacranolides, indicating their likely involvement in the biogenesis
29
of eudesmanolides (Scheme VI).

Yoshioka and coworkers ’ have successfully transformed 
epoxyeudesmanolides into eremophilanolides upon acid treatment as 
seen in Scheme VII. This supports the assumption that the eudes­
manolides could be the biogenetic precursors for the eremophilanolides.

There is also evidence that furan precursors could be involved
32-34
in the formation of the eremophilanolide lactone ring.
Biogenesis of the guaianolides from the germacranolides can 
be envisioned, as in the biogenesis of the eudesmanolides, to proceed 
via an epoxygermacranolide. In Scheme VIII, the 4,5-epoxygermacrolide
(28) is rearranged in the presence of an acid catalyst to form the 
cis-fused guaianolide cation (2|) which, upon uptake of water, forms 
the cis-fused guaianolide skeleton (30). If the guaianolide cation
(29) undergoes hydride and methyl shifts as shown by the arrows, the
pseudoguaianolide skeleton (11) will result.

8. Isolation and Structure Elucidation of Sesquiterpene Lactones 
In the past decade several new analytical techniques have 
appeared that have been welcome additions to the more classical 
methods of isolation. The technique most commonly used to isolate 
sesquiterpene lactones from dried plant material is essentially as 
follows: a known amount of dried plant material is first extracted
with an appropriate organic solvent; this crude extract is chromato­
graphed on an open column usually consisting of silica gel; the
16
fractions thus obtained are further purified by smaller columns or by
thick layer chromatography. However, many mixtures cannot be
completely purified by this technique alone. The introduction of high
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) has greatly aided the natural-
products chemist in the purification of complex mixtures. HPLC has
been especially useful in separation work involving very small sample
sizes. Examples have begun to appear in the literature citing the
application of HPLC in the separation of pure compounds from crude 
35
plant extracts.
The development of volatile derivatives of sesquiterpene
lactone mixtures has led to the employment of gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) as a valuable tool in the analysis of these 
36
natural products. However, routine structure eludication of a 
sesquiterpene lactone requires both physical and chemical methods.
Some of the common physical methods used are nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectrometry (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), infrared 
spectrometry (IR), ultraviolet sepctrometry (UV), circular dichroism 
(CD), and X-ray analysis.
Some of the standard reactions employed in the analysis of 
sesquiterpene lactones will be presented to illustrate their useful­
ness in the structure elucidation of these complex natural products.
a. Oxidations and Reductions. Oxidation reactions yield both 
structural and stereochemical information. From changes in the NMR 
spectrum and in the mass spectrum after oxidation, much can be learned 
about the hydroxylation pattern of a compound. This is clearly
17
demonstrated in Scheme IX, the oxidation of melcanthin A (32). When 
(32) was oxidized with activated MnC^, the downfield shift of H-5

37
substantiated the presence of an allylic alcohol.
38
Herz and Sharma have used the oxidation of an allylic
alcohol to an aldehyde to determine the configuration of the carbon-
carbon double bond. They noted that the NMR chemical shift of the
aldehyde proton in a,B-unsaturated medium ring aldehydes depends on
the configuration of the double bond. NMR absorptions near 10 ppm or
above generally occur with compounds containing trans double bonds.
Compounds with the cis configuration usually exhibit chemical shifts
near 9.5 ppm. "Herz's rule" was used (Scheme IX) to support the
37
presence of a cis-4,5 double bond in melcanthin A. Numerous other
examples that follow this empirical rule can be found in the
„ 39-42
literature.
18
Other oxidation reactions commonly employed in the structure
elucidation of sesquiterpene lactones are chromium trioxide oxidation
43 44 45-46
of an alcohol ’ and peracid epoxidation of double bonds. In
47 48 49 50
addition, dehydration ’ and dehydrogenation * reactions are
frequently employed.
Reductions of sesquiterpene lactones with either I^/Pd-C or
NaBH^ in methanol generally yield the 11,13-dihydro-derivatives. In
51
the reduction of the melampolide maculatin (34), catalytic
hydrogenation and NaBH^ reduction yielded different epimeric
11,13-dihydro-derivatives, (35) and (36) (Scheme X).
Reductions involving the use of either Zn-Cu couple or Ct CI^
to reduce epoxides to alkenes have been helpful in structure
elucidations of sesquiterpene lactones. The structure correlation of
linderane (J2) with linderalactone (38) was accomplished using
52
reduction with (Scheme XI).
b. Cyclizations. Acid-catalyzed cyclization reactions have
been extremely useful in the characterization of germacranolides.
Scheme XII outlines a typical example of this reaction, the cyclization
53
of tulipinolide (39). The NMR spectrum of the cyclized product (40) 
allowed, by analogy, stereochemical assignments for the C-6 and C-8 
oxygen functions in tulipinolide.
c. Hydrolysis, Relactonizations, and Esterifications. 
Hydrolysis under alkaline conditions is frequently desired in the 
structure elucidation of a sesquiterpene lactone. This can yield 
valuable information about the side chain ester functions that are

present. Herz and Sharma have shown that there exists a distinct 
difference in the ease of hydrolysis of various esters with K^CO^ in 
methanol-water at room temperature.
Treatment of sesquiterpene lactones with strong base, followed 
by acidification will result in a relactonization as seen in Scheme 
XIII. Cnicin (41) rearranges to the 7,8-lactone artemisiifolin (42).

Similar relactonizations, from C-7,6 to C-7,8 lactonic compounds, 
generally occur with C-8 alpha-oxygenated germacranolides. However,
21
such treatment of eupatoriopicrin (43) to produce eupatolide (44) 
(Scheme XIV) results in retention of the C-7,6 lactone, due to the
OH

S-configuration of the C-8 oxygen function which does not allow easy

lactonization. These examples have led to a general rule for
germacranolide relactonization: molecules with a C-7,6 lactone and
an a-C-8 oxygen function will, upon treatment with strong base followed
by acidification, relactonize to C-8; if a 8-C-8 oxygen function is
57present, the formation of a cis C-7,8 lactone is disfavored.
Esterification reactions, especially acetylations, have been
employed quite often as an indication of the presence of primary and
secondary alcohols. Conversion of an alcohol to a diastereomeric
mixture of esters is the chemical basis of the Horeau Method, a
partial resolution method for the configurational assignment of
alcohols. This method has been applied with reasonable success to
58-60
sesquiterpene lactones.
22
d. Cope Rearrangements. The Cope rearrangement has been of 
great importance in structural studies of germacranolide-type sesqui­
terpene lactones. Two recent reviews have been written on this 
61 62
subject. * The Cope rearrangement can yield important structural
information since, in general, the reaction is highly stereospecific
for germacranolides. It is known to proceed through a chair-like
transition state (46), as is shown in Scheme XV. Dihydrochamissonin
diacetate (45) undergoes a highly stereospecific Cope rearrangement
63to yield a divinylcyclohexane derivative (47).

well investigated. Two photochemical processes involving germa­
cranolides are outlined in Schemes XVI and XVII. In Scheme XVI the
irradiation of 11,13-dihydrocostunolide (48) resulted in the formation

9. Biological Activity of Sesquiterpene Lactones
Although most of the reactions that are typical for sesqui­
terpene lactones were discovered in the course of structure elucidation, 
this is certainly not their sole value. Some of these reactions have 
been applied in the study of structure-biological activity relation­
ships. The modification of sesquiterpene lactones to study the effect 
of various functional groups on activity has produced some insight 
into how these compounds exert their influence.
Sesquiterpene lactones exhibit various modes of biological
53—  76
activity, about which numerous reviews have been written. Two
of the most pronounced biological effects exerted by these natural
products are cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity. These will be
discussed in more detail following a brief description of some other
interesting biological effects attributable to sesquiterpene lactones.
The anti-microbial activity of sesquiterpene lactones has been
known for quite a few years.^ In vitro inhibition of growth of both
the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the yeast Candida albicans
has been effected by two germacranolides, mikanolide (52) and dihydro- 
78
mikanolide (53). Russian workers found that ten of the eighty-two
(52) (53)
25
sesquiterpene lactones that were tested showed strong in vitro
protozoacidal activity against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas
79vaginalis (active at 0.24-7.8 yg/ml). These workers also found that
certain functional groups generally conferred increased activity. The
exocyclic methylene in conjunction with the lactone carbonyl and an
acetyl group or ketone on the ring, were all responsible for general
increases in protozoacidal activity. Other reports of similar anti-
80 81
microbial activity have been published. ’
Plant growth regulation has been exhibited by sesquiterpene
82
lactones of many structural types. Vernolepin (54) has been shown
83
to inhibit the growth of wheat coleoptile sections by 20-80%, while 
alantolactone (55) was shown not only to inhibit seedling growth, but
(54) (55)
84
also to inhibit seed germination. It appears that the exocyclic
methylene group, or some other electrophilic site, may be responsible
for the regulatory action. It has been shown that these plant growth
effects may be reduced by the elimination of the exocyclic methylene 
85
group.
26
Eremanthine (56), costunolide (57), and 3-cyclocostunolide
(58), three sesquiterpene lactones isolated from the bark of Brazilian
86
trees, were found to have schistosomicidal properties. These 
lactones prevented skin penetration by the cercariae of the trematode, 
Schi-stosoma mansoni. It is interesting to note that dihydro-a- 
cyclocostunolide (59) was found to be inactive, indicating that the 
exocyclic methylene group on the lactone ring is necessary for 
activity.
(56) (57)
( 5 8 ) (59)
27
In a study of the members of the genus Vemonia (Compositae),
Burnett et al. found that the presence of sesquiterpene lactones can
87provide a plant with some resistance to insect feeding. In an 
experiment using five species of insects, Spodoptera eridania,
S. frigiperda, S. omithogalli, Diaorisia Virginia, and Triehoplusia 
ni, the larval feeding preferences were tested on agar medium 
supplemented with glaucolide A (60). Larval feeding was found to be 
inversely proportional to the concentration of glaucolide A in the 
medium.

Hymenoxys odorata, more commonly known as bitterweed, has
been known to be a livestock toxicant that primarily affects sheep and 
88
goats. The major sesquiterpene lactone present in Texas populations 
of bitterweed, hymenovin (61), was shown to be involved in the death
OH
(61)
of sheep. Sesquiterpene lactones are also suspected to be involved
28
in some way with the many other species of Compositae that are
73reported to be poisonous to livestock. Bitterweed has also been
known to impart a bitter taste to the milk of cattle that have eaten 
90
the plant. When tenulin (62), a constituent of EeZenium amarium,
was administered to a lactating cow, a resultant bitter taste was
91
found in the milk.
In 1956 the American weed Parthenium hysterophorus was
accidentally introduced into India. In certain cities of India,
allergic contact dermatitis has now become a major public health
problem. The major allergen in P. hysterophorus is the pseudo-
73
guaianolide, parthenin (63).
29
When over eighty sesquiterpene lactones were tested for their
allergenicity, it was demonstrated that the most important requisite
was the presence of the a-methylene group, exocyclic to the 
92 93
y-lactone. ’ In fact, all the known allergenic sesquiterpene
73
lactones contain an exocyclic-a-methylene function. It is
postulated that these functions may react with sulfhydryl groups in
proteins via a Michael-type addition to form compounds capable of
93producing the allergic reaction (Scheme XVIII).

SCHEME XVIII
In the past fifteen years enormous effort has been expended 
in the isolation and structure elucidation of cytotoxic and anti­
tumor active sesquiterpene lactones. ^ T h i s  is probably due 
in great part to the formal plant screening program instituted in the
early 1960's by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The first crude
102plant extract was tested at NCI in 1956. From the beginning of the
program there was a steady increase in the number of plant extracts
submitted for screening until 1973, at which time the number leveled
,, 103 off.
Samples submitted to NCI are screened for both cytotoxicity 
and anti-tumor activity. An in vitvo tumor system known as KB has
30
been widely used to test cytotoxicity of crude plant extracts. The KB
system is composed of human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
Cytotoxicity is defined as an ED^q value of greater than or equal to
2.0, whereas ED,_q is equal to the effective dose in yg/ml at which 50%
inhibition of cell growth (versus untreated controls) is observed. Two
in vivo tumor systems used to test the anti-tumor activity of plant-
derived extracts are LE and PS. The host employed in both is the mouse.
The tumor in the LE system is a lymphoid leukemia L-1210, while in the
PS system it is a lymphocytic leukemia P388. Activity is expressed in
terms of increase in life span, ILS. An ILS value greater than or equal
to 25% is considered active in the LE system whereas an ILS value
greater than or equal to 30% is considered PS-active. In vivo activity
is also often expressed as a ratio of test to control known as T/C,
representing 100 times the ratio of average survival time of treated
animals to that of control animals (T/C = 100 + ILS).
Approximately two hundred sesquiterpene lactones have been
tested in the Natural Products Section of the NCI program. Of these,
about 35% have shown cytotoxic activity and about 20% have shown
104
anti-tumor activity. Scheme XIX shows some examples of cytotoxic
and anti-tumor active sesquiterpene lactones. All of these compounds
are biologically active and they also possess a,8-unsaturated double
bonds. As the results in Scheme XX indicate, the a,8-unsaturated
96
carbonyl functions appear to be necessary for activity. Further
work has pointed to the importance of the conjugated a-methylene
108
lactone function in cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity. Reactions

of various unsaturated lactones with model biological nucleophiles

have been shown to diminish or completely eliminate activity.
Results of the reactions of three cytotoxic sesquiterpene lactones
with L-cysteine are given in Scheme XXI. The bis-cysteine adduct (73)
was essentially devoid of KB activity. The monocysteine derivatives
(71) and (72) were appreciably less cytotoxic than the parent
compounds, (69) and (70). These results support the idea that the
a-methylene-y-lactone function plays a significant role in the mode
of action of these compounds, and that these compounds react with
active sulfhydryl groups on enzymes that are involved in the cell
division process. To test this theory further, studies were
performed with active sesquiterpene lactones and the enzyme
phosphofructokinase.
Phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phospho-
transferase, EC 2.7.1.11) catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-
6-phosphate (74) to fructose-1,6-diphosphate (75) (Scheme XXII) in
+2
the first stage of glycolysis. Mg is required for catalysis,
presumably because the actual substrate is not ATP but MgATP. The
phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate is an important control point
in glycolysis. Phosphofructokinase is an allosteric (regulatory)
enzyme, and like most allosteric enzymes has a rather high molecular
weight (-360,000) and shows a complex dependence of its reaction
111
velocity on substrate concentration. Phosphofructokinase activity
is regulated by a variety of substances including its substrate, 
substrate analogs such as AMP and cyclic 3',5'-AMP, and by the

structurally unrelated compound, citrate. Thiol groups are known

to be important to the catalytic activity of phosphofructokinase.
114
Engel'hardt and Sokov reported that oxidizing agents affected the
activity of the enzyme. More recently Paetkau and Lardy proved a
direct relationship between the thiol potential of phosphofructokinase
112
and the enzyme's activity.
Phosphofructokinase activity may be assayed in many different
ways but the most common is the coupled procedure described by Ling 
115and coworkers. Using this method, phosphofructokinase activity is
determined by coupling the reaction catalyzed by phosphofructokinase
with the other two reactions shown in Scheme XXII. For each mole of
fructose-1,6-aiphosphate formed in the reaction catalyzed by phospho-
fructokinase, there is one mole of NADH oxidized. It is this
oxidation that is actually being monitored in the assay of activity.
The decrease in UV absorption at 340 nm is measured at pH = 8.0 and
28°C, where the enzyme activity is maximal.
116
Kupchan and coworkers studied the effects of a number of 
compounds on the activity of phosphofructokinase, including some 
sesquiterpene lactones. Euparotin acetate (79), eupacunin (80), and 
vernolepin (54) all showed 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at 
relative concentrations of 1000 to 2000 moles of inhibitor per 
protomer of enzyme. In comparison with inhibition of some standard 
sulfhydryl reagents, these a,8-unsaturated lactones are about ten 
times as effective as iodoacetamide (81). If these three sesqui­
terpene lactones were first reacted with dithiothreitol (82), and

then allowed to react with phosphofructokinase, no inhibition of the 
enzyme was observed. This could indicate that the sesquiterpene 
lactones inhibit phosphofructokinase because of their affinity for 
the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme, which are essential for enzyme 
activity.

38
An investigation into the potential biological activity of 
the genus Melampodium, of the sunflower family (Compositae), was begun 
in this laboratory several years ago. Many crude plant extracts were 
submitted to the National Cancer Institute (hereafter NCI) to 
determine their possible cytotoxicity and anticancer activity. Table 
I contains selected results obtained from the NCI screening program.
To be considered PS-active a plant extract should have a T/C 
value of 130 or greater. It is immediately obvious that only three 
of the extracts in Table I are PS-active. Of these three, Melampodium 
cinereum, Stuessy-Fisher #2015B is the most anti-tumor active crude 
extract. Therefore, the population #2015B was selected for a 
systematic chemical investigation to determine its natural products, 
especially the sesquiterpene lactones present, with the hope of 
finding the anti-tumor active constituent(s).

la. Isolation of Possible Anti-Tumor Active Sesquiterpene Lactones 
The method for the isolation of sesquiterpene lactones from 
Metampodiian cinevewn # 2015B followed the basic procedure outlined 
below.
1. A known amount of dried plant material was ground in 
a Waring blender and then extracted with chloroform.
This slurry was filtered and reextracted after which 
the combined chloroform extracts were evaporated to 
yield a crude syrup.
2. The crude syrup was dissolved in ethanol, treated with 
a 5% aqueous lead (II) acetate solution, and then 
filtered through filter aid (Celite). The lead (II) 
acetate solution precipitated most of the phenolic 
compounds as well as the chlorophylls.
3. The filtrate was evaporated to approximately one-half 
of its original volume and then extracted three times 
with appropriate amounts of chloroform. The combined 
chloroform extracts were dried over magnesium 
sulfate, filtered, and evaporated leaving a crude 
terpenoid-containing extract.
Crude Melampodiim oineveum # 2015B extract (1.5-2.0 g) was 
sent to NCI for anti-tumor testing. Results of these tests, seen in 
Table 1, indicated high PS activity. The crude plant extract was 
therefore chromatographically fractionated on silica gel as described 
in Part IV of this dissertation. Over 200 fractions were collected 
and were combined according to TLC analysis. Twenty-two combined 
fractions of extract 2015B were submitted to NCI for cytotoxicity 
tests. Table 2 contains the results of this screening which indicates 
highest cytotoxicity, and therefore highest probable anti-tumor 
activity, in fractions 28-37. Further purification of this fraction 
was initiated using preparative layer chromatography. The bands

isolated from the preparative plate were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, 
which indicated mixtures of the same sturctural types of medium ring 
sesquiterpene lactones with differing ester side chains. The 
separation of the lactone mixtures was performed by high pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reverse phase y-Bondapak C^g 
column. Two of the bands from the preparative layer plate contained 
similar mixtures. The HPLC chromatograms of these bands are seen in 
Figures 1 and 2. Three pure compounds were collected from band IA, 
while two pure compounds and one two-component mixture were obtained 
from band IB. Each peak in the LC traces of Figures 1 and 2 yielded 
approximately 8 mg of material. The structural elucidation of the 
pure compounds and of the mixtures will be discussed below.
IB. Physical Data of Melcanthin A (32)
From a previous study of Melampodium leuoanthum carried out
in our laboratory, the isolation of three new cis-l(lO), cis-4,5-
37germacranolides, melcanthin A, B, and C was reported. The isolation 
of these compounds from this species was of considerable biochemical 
systematic interest since it completed the finding of this rare 
fourth germacranolide subgroup in Melampodium.
Examination of the NMR spectra of Melampodium cinereum 
// 2015B, fractions 28-37, suggested the presence of compounds similar 
to the melcanthins. For instance, several signals near 2.0 ppm 
(acetate methyl), 3.7 ppm (carbomethoxy), and doublets at approximately 
5.8 and 6.3 ppm (lactonic exocyclic methylenes) are typical for

melcanthins. Furthermore, the 100 MHz NMR spectrum of fraction 
28-37 in CDCl^ exhibited broadened signals at ambient temperatures 
which sharpened considerably when the spectrum was obtained at 60°C, 
a phenomenon which is typical for melcanthin-type compounds and will 
be discussed later. After purification of fraction 28-37, the 
structure elucidation of the melcanthins present indicated that one 
of the compounds was melcanthin A (32). The following physical and

spectral data of melcanthin A were used in the structure elucidations 
of the other cis,cis-germacranolides.
Melcanthin A (32), *-'23^28^9’ ‘*'S t *16 comPound present in peaks 
it 2 and 3 of the LC traces in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The IR 
spectrum of melcanthin A exhibited absorptions typical of an 
a-methylene-y-lactone at 1755 cm \  Other IR absorptions at 3500, 
1660, and 1640 cm \  indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and 
double bonds. The identity of the newly isolated compound was 
deduced by analysis of the 100 MHz and 200 MHz ^H-NMR spectral data 
and the mass spectral fragmentation patterns, followed by comparison 
of these data with the published data for melcanthin A.
46
The 200 MHz ^H-NMR spectrum of melcanthin A was obtained in 
CDClg at ambient temperature (Figure 3). The spectrum showed a 
quartet of a quartet at 6.08 ppm (H-3'), a doublet of a quartet at 
1.92 ppm (C-S'-CH^), and a narrowly-spaced multiplet at 1.74 ppm 
(C^'-CH^), absorptions typical of the angeloyl m o i e t y . T w o  
singlets of three-proton intensity each at 2.08 and 3.65 ppm were 
assigned to an acetate methyl group and the C-14 carbomethyoxy methyl 
group, respectively.
The low resolution mass spectrum of melcanthin A (Table 3) 
verified the above NMR assignments for the ester side chains. The 
base peak at m/z 83 (C^H^O), a peak at m/z 100 (C,-Hg02), and a strong 
peak at m/z 55 (C^H^) supported the presence of an angeloyl moiety. 
Furthermore, peaks at m/z 43 (CH^CO), m/z 406 (M-C^H^O), and m/z 
388 (M-C2H^0 2) indicated the presence of an acetate group in (32).
The appearance of m/z 388 by loss of acetic acid via a McLafferty 
rearrangement is well documented for acetate derivatives with hydrogens 
beta to the carbon containing the acetoxy group. The peak at m/z 
307 could be due to the loss of the angelate radical (C^H^O^) from 
m/z 406. Further loss of water from m/z 307 would result in m/z 289. 
Scheme XXIII illustrates these basic fragmentation patterns of 
melcanthin A.
The peak at m/z 228 could arise from m/z 256 by an expulsion 
of CO from the lactone (Scheme XXIV). The loss of CO from a-methylene- 
y-lactones appears to be common.

Examination of the remaining NMR data accounted for most of
the medium ring protons. A broadened triplet at 7.15 ppm (H-l) is 
typical for the 3-hydrogen of the a,3-unsaturated carbomethoxy 
group. This downfield absorption of the H-l proton indicates a cis 
orientation of the 3_hydrogen and the C-14 carboxyl group, which is 
evidence for the presence of a cis double bond between C-l and C-10 
in the medium ring of (32). Irradiation of the broad triplet at
7.15 ppm resulted in a sharpening of the broad multiplet at 2.41 ppm 
and suggested the presence of alkane-type protons at C-2. The 
broadened two-proton singlet at 4.11 ppm is typical for a 
hydroxylated C-15. Its broadening suggests allylic coupling to H-5 
(5.65 ppm). Irradiation of the multiplet at 3.15 ppm (H-7) collapsed 
both of the doublets at 5.81 (H-13a) and 6.36 ppm (H-13b) to singlets, 
while the broadened triplet at 5.42 ppm (H-6) was simplified to a 
broadened doublet. The doublet of a doublet at 5.87 ppm (H-8) changed 
to a doublet. Saturation of H-8 in turn sharpened the multiplet at
3.15 ppm and collapsed the broadened doublet at 6.04 ppm (H-9) to a 
singlet. Irradiation of H-6 caused the broad doublet at 5.65 ppm
51
(H-5) to collapse to a singlet. The above NMR assignment accounted 
for all oxygens in melcanthin A and for all but one carbon and two 
hydrogens, which appeared between 2.3 and 2.8 ppm. From the chemical 
shift of the two remaining protons a CH^ moiety was assigned at C-3. 
The NMR assignments for melcanthin A are summarized in Table 4.

previously for melampolides. Unfortunately, not enough material 
was available to complete this experiment, but the mass spectral 
data cited above strongly suggested attachment of the acetate group 
to C-9, leaving the angelate ester at C-8 .
All the above mass spectral and NMR information, along with
arguments for a cis-4,5-double (page 15), completed the cis,cis-
germacranolide skeleton (32). Comparison of the published data for 
37
melcanthin A with the NMR assignments and mass spectral patterns of 
(32), proved that this newly isolated sesquiterpene lactone was 
indeed melcanthin A.
Ic. The Structure of Melcanthin D (83)
In terms of probable biological activity, the most 
interesting compound found in Melaxngodivm oinereim # 2015B was 
melcanthin D. It was apparent from its NMR and mass spectral data 
that this compound was very similar to melcanthin A (32). These two 
germacranolides differ in the ester side chain present at C-8 , an 
angelate group in (32) that is replaced by a methacrylate ester in 
(83). Data from the National Cancer Institute^^ has indicated that 
a number of methacrylate-containing sesquiterpene lactones exhibited 
anti-tumor activity.

to peak # 1 of the LC trace in Figure 2. The IR spectrum showed 
absorptions at 3500, 1755, 1725, and 1640 cm \  indicating the 
presence of hydroxyls, esters, y-lactone, and double bonds,
55
respectively. Due to the lack of material, the structure of 
melcanthin D was mainly established by correlation of the 200 MHz 
■^ H NMR data and the mass spectral fragmentation patterns of (83) 
with those for melcanthin A.
HO
6h - (83)
The 200 MHz ^H NMR of melcanthin D was run in CDCl^ at 
ambient temperature (Figure 4). The NMR parameters suggested that 
melcanthin D and melcanthin A had the same medium ring skeleton.
The only apparent difference between these two compounds appeared 
to be in the side chain at C-8 . The characteristic three-proton 
signals for acetate (2.07 ppm) and carbomethoxy (3.61 ppm) were 
easily assigned. The remaining proton absorptions of melcanthin D 
were assigned by detailed double irradiation experiments. When the 
multiplet at 3.13 ppm (H-7) was irradiated, the doublets at 5.78 
(H-13a) and 6.34 ppm (H-13b) collapsed to singlets. Furthermore, 
the broad triplet at 5.40 ppm (H-6) sharpened slightly and the 
doublet of a doublet at 5.80 ppm (H-8) simplified to a doublet.

Irradiation of H-8 in turn sharpened the multiplet at 3.13 ppm (H-7)
and also collapsed the doublet at 6.01 ppm (H-9) to a singlet.
Saturation of H-6 simplified the doublet at 5.62 ppm (H-5) to a
singlet. Irradiation of the broad triplet at 7.14 ppm (H-l)
sharpened the signals near 2.2-2.8 ppm, indicating that the C-2
carbon must be saturated. When the multiplet at 1.80 ppm (2'-CH^)
was irradiated, the doublets of a quartet at 5.51 (H-3'a) and 5.94 ppm
(H-3'b) were simplified to doublets, a pattern of NMR signals which
is typical for methacrylate esters. Table 4 summarizes the NMR
parameters for (83)•
Further support for the presence of a methacrylate ester side
chain was provided by low resolution mass spectral data for (83)
(see Table 3), as indicated by the base peak at m/z 69 (C^H^O) and
the peaks at m/z 393 (M-C^H,.) and m/z 348 (C^H^O^). Additional
peaks at m/z 43 (C^H^O), m/z 377 (M-C2H^02), and m/z 392 (M-C2H 2O)
were strong indications of the presence of an acetate moiety. The
1X8
peak at m/z 374 must result from a McLafferty rearrangement, while 
the peak at m/z 392 can be accounted for by the loss of ketene.
Scheme XXVI illustrates some of these fragmentations. Information 
about the attachments of the acetate and methacrylate esters at the 
medium ring in (83) was obtained from the mass spectral ions seen in 
Scheme XXVII. Melcanthin D gave a significant peak at m/z 128 
which was assigned to the ion shown in Scheme XXVII. This peak, 
along with the relatively minor peak at m/z 170, strongly indicated 
the presence of the acetate group at C-9. As described in section lb

irradiation experiments, accounted for all the oxygens present in (83) 
and for all but one carbon and two hydrogens, which by analogy with 
melcanthin A must be represented by a unit at C-3, thus completing 
the cis,cis-germacranolide structure for melcanthin D.

and mass spectral data of melcanthin E with that of melcanthin A.

The ■*'H NMR spectrum of melcanthin E (seen in Figure 5) 
provided evidence that the basic skeletons of melcanthin E and 
melcanthin A were very similar, differing only in the ester side chain 
present at C-8 . The singlet at 2.08 ppm indicated the presence of an 
acetate group, while the singlet at 3.69 ppm was reminiscent of the 
carbomethoxy function. Decoupling experiments suggested that the 
ester side chain in melcanthin E was the isobutyrate ester instead of 
the angelate ester of melcanthin A. When the set of doublets at 
1.0 ppm were irradiated, the heptet at 2.45 ppm (H-2’)
collapsed to a singlet. These signals in the NMR are very typical for 
the isobutyrate function.

Extensive double irradiation experiments were performed to 
deduce the basic skeletal structure of (84). Irradiation at 7.14 ppm 
(H-l) sharpened the broad multiplet at 2.2-2.5 ppm, indicating that 
the C-2 carbon was saturated. The downfield absorption of H-l and 
its broadened nature are common for cis-l(lO) compounds with a carbo- 
methoxy function at the C-10 position. Upon irradiation of the 
multiplet at 3.07 ppm (H-7), the doublets at 5.73 (H-13a) and 
6.34 ppm (H-13b) collapsed to singlets, while the doublet of a 
doublet at 5.77 ppm (H-8) simplified to a doublet. Furthermore, the 
broad triplet at 5.42 ppm (H-6) sharpened to a doublet. Saturation 
of the broad doublet at 6.01 ppm (H-9) changed the doublet of a 
doublet at 5.77 ppm (H-8 ) to a doublet. The broadened doublet at 
4.10 ppm (H-15), along with the downfield absorption of H-5 
(5.61 ppm) that indicated a C-4,5 double bond, provided evidence 
that no protons were present at C-4. All of the basic skeletal 
protons with the exception of the protons at C-3 were accounted for 
and the appearance of the C-3 protons in the upfield region of the 
spectrum (2.3-2.5) indicated a CH^ group at C-3. Table 4 summarizes 
the NMR data of melcanthin E.
The remaining mass spectral data supported structure (84) for 
melcanthin E. The strong peak at m/z 43 ^ £ ^ 0 )  along with the peak 
at m/z 376 (M-C2H^02) indicated an acetate moiety in melcanthin E.

Other fragmentations are very similar to those encountered with

m/z 376 results in the peak at m/z 288. The loss of acetic acid
loss of CO from m/z 256, which was illustrated previously in 
Scheme XXIV. Loss of water from m/z 288 results in a peak at m/z 270. 
Proof for the attachment of the isobutyrate group at C-8 can be 
extracted from mass spectral data. A relatively strong peak at 
m/z 128 along with the appearance of a peak at m/z 170 strongly 
suggested that the acetate ester was attached to the medium ring at 
C-9. Scheme XXIX demonstrates the formation of these ions. Table 3

Ie. Configurational and Conformational Considerations 
of the Melcanthins
Configurational and conformational information on melcanthin A
had been derived from biogenetic considerations, NMR data, and
37
chemical modifications performed on this compound and analogues.
From biogenetic considerations, it can be assumed that the side chain
3
at C-7 in melcanthin A adopts a 3-configuration. The protons at 
H-5 and H-6 have antiperiplanar orientations as indicated by the large 
coupling constant (J , = 9.0Hz). The observed coupling of H-6, H-7
D , O
and H-7, H-8 led to the following conclusions concerning the cis or 
trans nature of the lactone ring. A synperiplanar orientation of H-6, 
H-7 or H-7, H-8 would be required if a 6,7- or 7,8-cis lactone were 
present in melcanthin A. Such an orientation generally results in 
coupling constants quite different from those observed. It was 
therefore considered quite unlikely that melcanthin A contained a cis 
lactone. If a 7,8-trans lactone were present in melcanthin A, the 
angle between H-7 and H-8 would require g to be greater than or 
equal to 6 Hz. Since the observed coupling constant was signifi­
cantly lower than th:'s value (J., „ = 2.0 Hz), the presence of a .

7,8-trans lactone was considered unlikely. Model considerations1 
indicated that if a 7,8-trans lactone were present, a nearly synperi­
planar orientation of H-6 and H-7 should be expected, which would 
require a much larger coupling constant than the one observed
(J^ , = 5.0 Hz), 
b, /
The NMR coupling data of melcanthin A can be best interpreted 
by a 7,6-trans lactone. The orientations of H-7 and H-8 should be a
66
and H-9 should be 8, all configurations that are common in
6 121
germacranolides of known absolute configuration from Melampodium. *
The cis nature of the double bond at C-l(lO) was supported
earlier by NMR data. The double bond at C-4,5 is probably cis, as
37judged from data obtained from earlier work in this laboratory. The
oxidation of the C-15 alcohol to an aldehyde resulted in an aldehydic
proton signal in the NMR occurring at approximately 9.5 ppm, which
38
according to Herz’s rule indicates a 4,5-cis double bond.
The subject of conformational isomers being present in these 
types of systems requires some comment. Rigid or preferred
conformations are generally observed with 7,6-lactonized
122 121 123
germacranolides, melampolides, and heliangolides. It
appears that the cis-1(10),cis-4,5-germacranolides are considerably
8 124 123
more flexible with respect to the medium ring skeleton, ’ ’
therefore possibly adopting several major conformations. This results 
in a broadening of the signals observed in the NMR at ambient 
temperatures.
If. Possible Biological Activity of the Melcanthins
The isolation of the melcanthin compounds just discussed was
approached in a very systematic fashion. Only the fraction of
Metampodium oinereum # 2015B that showed the greatest activity in the
fractionation testing at NCI was more carefully examined. Besides
containing these melcanthin-type sesquiterpene lactones, this fraction
also contained some dilactone sesquiterpenes and significant amounts
42
of the flavonoid artemetin (85). Artemetin had already been tested
OCH-
OCH-
( 8 5 )
OH O
for anti-tumor activity and had shown no appreciable activity. The 
dilactone sesquiterpenes present all appeared to be structurally 
related to the dilactone, melampodin B (86). Melampodin B had also
HO
been tested previously and had shown no significant activity. This 
led to the conclusion that the melcanthin compounds were the most 
likely contributors to the high anti-tumor activity shown by the 
active fraction of M. oinereum #2015B.
Melcanthin D was of greatest interest in terms of its 
possible activity, since the ester present at C-8 in this compound 
is a methacrylate. As mentioned previously, it was found from data 
obtained from NCI that a large percentage of methacrylate-containing
sesquiterpene lactones are anti-tumor active. It has been
postulated that the probable mode of action of sesquiterpenes involves 
a Michael-type addition of a biological nucleophile to the 
a,g-unsaturated bond. In melcanthin D, or any other methacrylate- 
containing sesquiterpene lactone, there would be an additional site 
for Michael addition to take place. There is also an additional site 
of a,g-unsaturation in melcanthin A represented by the angelate ester, 
but it is more sterically hindered and therefore may show lower 
reactivity toward biological nucleophiles.
Unfortunately, only 8 mg of melcanthin D was obtained, making 
it impossible to have this compound tested in the NCI program. 
Melcanthin A and melcanthin E were also obtained in small quantities 
(15 mg), not permitting PS activity tests at NCI. The only biological 
activity results obtained on these compounds were inhibition studies 
performed with the enzyme phosphofructokinase. These results will be 
discussed in Part III of this dissertation.
Ig. An Incomplete Structure Determination of Two 
New Sesquiterpene Lactones
Peak # 3 in the LC chromatogram (Figure 1) was broadened and 
appeared to contain a shoulder, which indicated a mixture of compounds. 
The following "^H NMR and mass spectral data did allow a tentative 
structure determination of the two compounds, which we named 
melcanthin F (87) and G (88).
The 200 MHz "Si NMR spectrum of the mixture in C,D, (Figure 6)

the sample (Table 5). Two sharp singlets near 1.43 ppm indicated two 
compounds, both containing an acetate function. This same double 
pattern was evident near 3.16 ppm due to the carbomethoxy moiety.
Two broad overlapping singlets at 3.38 ppm suggested the presence of 
CH^OH (C-15), as in the other melcanthins. The NMR signals for 
these compounds indicated a 60/40 ratio of the two constituents.
Decoupling experiments performed on the mixture provided 
useful information about the basic skeletons of these compounds and 
also about the various side chains that were present. Irradiation of 
the multiplet at 2.5 ppm (H-7) collapsed the pairs of doublets at 
5.77 and 5.79 ppm (H-13a) and at 6.05 and 6.08 ppm (H-13b) to singlets. 
Also affected were the doublets of doublets at 5.75 and 5.77 ppm 
(H-8) which simplified to doublets and the triplets at 5.13 and 5.15 
ppm (H-6) which changed to broad doublets. Irradiation of H-6 in 
turn sharpened the multiplet at 2.5 ppm (H-7). Saturation of the 
signals at 3.38 ppm (H-15) slightly affected the doublets at 5.05 and 
5.07 ppm (H-5) and the absorptions at 1.8-1.9 ppm (H-2) were sharpened 
when the signals at about 7.0 ppm (H-l) were irradiated. Due to 
solvent side bands present from 6.6-7.3 ppm, the triplets for H-l were 
obscured, but a spectrum run in CDCl^ clearly demonstrated the 
presence of a pair of broadened triplets at approximately 7.1 ppm. 
These irradiations account for all of the basic skeletal carbon 
protons with the exception of C-3 and C-9. Because of the similarity 
of the "Sl-NMR absorption of this mixture to melcanthin A, C-3 must 
be an obscured signal among the group of signals occurring between

1.75 and 1.95 ppm and must represent a Cl^ moiety. Also, by 
comparison with melcanthin A, it can be deduced that the broad 
doublets near 5.91 ppm represent H-9, the chemical shift being 
indicative of the presence of an ester function at C-9.
Further irradiations gave considerable information about the 
side chain ester functions present in this mixture. When the triplets 
at 0.5 ppm were irradiated, the multiplet at 1.74 was sharpened. 
Saturation of the doublets at 0.7 ppm caused the multiplet at 1.0 ppm 
to sharpen. When the multiplet near 1.7 ppm was irradiated, it 
caused the triplets at 0.5 ppm to collapse to a set of doublets, 
while the multiplet at 1.0 ppm was again sharpened. This pattern of 
signals indicates the presence of an a-methylbutyrate ester in this 
mixture.
The low resolution mass spectrum of this mixture (Table 6) 
supported the presence of an a-methylbutyrate side chain by the 
occurrence of the base peak at m/z 85 (C H.O), the intense peak at
j y
m/z 57 (C^Hg) and a peak at m/z 349 (M-C,.Hg02). The rather intense
peak at m/ z 43 (C^H^O) along with the peak at m/z 390 , due
118
to the McLafferty rearrangement, indicated the presence of an 
acetate function. Scheme XXX demonstrates that the basic fragmen­
tation patterns of this mixture are very similar to those of the 
melcanthin compounds previously discussed.
The mass spectral and NMR data on (87) and (88) together gave 
much information concerning the ester side chains present in these 
compounds. Scheme XXXI shows mass spectral fragmentations that

The peaks at m/z 170 and m/z 128 accounted for the acetate group at 
C-9, while the peak at m/z 212 resulted from the isomer with the 
a-methylbutyrate group at C-9. From the relative abundances of peaks 
m/z 170 and 212, it was calculated that these isomers were present in 
a 60/40 ratio, which coincided with the ratio calculated from NMR data.
Combining this mass spectral information with the NMR data, 
it was concluded that (87) and (88) could be represented by the 
positional isomers illustrated below. These structures were not only
76
consistent with the physical data, but also explained the
inseparability of these compounds on the LC under the conditions
utilized to separate the other melcanthins. Furthermore, since a
reversed phase C1Q column was used in the separation, the most polar 
lo
compound should have eluted first. Of the five melcanthins obtained 
from the LC, the a-methylbutyrates (87) and (88) are the least poicr 
and should be the last compounds to elute from the column, which was 
indeed the case (Figure 1).
PART II
Modification Reactions 
of
Sesquiterpene Lactones from 
the Genus Melampodium (Compositae)
77
Various sesquiterpene lactones are biologically active in a 
73
multitude of ways, including cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity. 
Considerable interest has been generated in the past decade as to 
the modes of action these compounds use in exerting biological 
effects. The project described in this part of the dissertation was 
undertaken with the hope that by producing derivatives of a group of 
compounds in a systematic manner, the effects of relative position 
and of functionality on cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity could be 
elucidated. Some work has been carried out along these 
l i n e s , b u t  none of the investigations were extensive. To 
better understand the rationale used in the selection of specific 
sesquiterpene lactones and the derivatives to be made, some back­
ground data will be presented first.
Ila. Summary of Antineoplastic Activity and Cytotoxicity Data 
of Sesquiterpene Lactones Performed at the National 
Cancer Institute
In spite of extensive testing of sesquiterpene lactones at 
NCI, no attempt had been made to assimilate all of the accumulated 
data and determine whether any trends in structure-activity relation­
ships could be established. Upon our request, the Natural Products 
Section of NCI made available activity data on sesquiterpene lactones 
that had been obtained from the start of the program up through the 
end of 1977. From this information, it was learned that of the 181 
tested sesquiterpene lactones, 69 compounds (38%) were cytotoxic 
(KB < 2.0) and approximately 19% were antineoplastic agents (based on 
LE, PS, and WA activities, where T/C = 125). This indicated that more 
compounds were cytotoxic than anti-tumor active. Table 7 shows the
Table 7

activity data of the various structural types of lactones. In 
examining the different major structural classes, the germacranolides 
appear to be statistically the most likely group of compounds to 
display antineoplastic activity. It must be noted, however, that this 
class of sesquiterpene lactones also produces the largest percentage 
of cytotoxic compounds.
It has generally been assumed that there exists a relation­
ship between cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity. Figure 7 shows a 
graphical representation of antineoplastic activity (represented by 
the ILS) vs cytotoxicity values (ED^q ) for a number of sesquiterpene 
lactones. There appears to be no correlation between these activity 
data. Since cytotoxicity of a compound against KB cells and non- 
malignant cells might be expected to be similar, it seems reasonable 
that low cytotoxicity and high anti-tumor activity would be desirable 
qualities in a compound. Therefore, one could ask the question, what 
structural and other variables may affect cytotoxicity and/or anti­
tumor activity?
First, one variable that is generally examined in a 
pharmacological study is the dose level of a compound, in order to 
establish the dosage of highest activity. Examining some specific 
examples of lactones provided much insight into the dosage-anti-tumor 
activity relationship. For instance, Figure 8 shows a plot of the 
dose level vs PS-activity of the guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone 
graminiliatrin (89). One observed an increase in PS activity with 
increasing dosage that peaked near 50 mg/kg of animal weight, and then

dropped off rather rapidly. As shown in Figure 9, a similar situation 
was found in the case of the two pseudoguaianolides, helenalin (90) 
and fastigilin C (91), except that considerably lower dosages were 
necessary for maximal activity. The most PS-active of all 
sesquiterpene lactones, helenalin, showed a particularly narrow range 
of high PS-activity, whereas the activity range of fastigilin C was 
quite broad but did show a rapid drop-off, indicating a lesser cyto­
toxicity of (91) at higher dose levels. From this data it can be 
concluded that at a certain dose level, the increase of antineoplastic 
activity will be counteracted by the concurrent increase in toxicity 
and therefore a maximal dosage level should be seen. This concept 
is depicted graphically in Figure 10. A logical assumption is that 
in finding the optimal dose level, one is simply balancing the 
cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects.
A variable that is particularly sensitive to chemical 
manipulation is the functionality of a molecule. Tables 8 and 9 show 
cytotoxic and antineoplastic activities of two series of 
germacranolides. For instance, in Table 8, as the R group of 
erioflorin (92) is changed from hydroxy to acetate to methacrylate, 
the PS and KB activities are affected, the least cytotoxic and most 
anti-tumor active derivative being the acetate. Table 9 contains the 
data for costunolide (57) and parthenolide (93). Again, the most 
anti-tumor active compound, parthenolide, is the least cytotoxic.

cytotoxicity would not necessarily increase the anti-tumor activity 
of the lactone. In fact, it was shown that not many of the cyto­
toxic sesquiterpene lactones had shown in vivo anti-tumor activity. 
Parthenolide and costunolide differ only in the 4,5-epoxide function 
that is present in (9J) and absent in (57). It has been postulated 
for some time that in many epoxide-containing sesquiterpene lactones,
the epoxide function is responsible in contributing to the anti-tumor
97 105 132or cytotoxic activity. ’ ’ The epoxy group may act as a
secondary site for alkylation in addition to the essential center, the
109 133
a-methylene-y-lactone moiety. * From the data presented, it is
already clear how great an effect the position and stereochemistry of
a functionality on a molecule has on its cytotoxicity and anti-tumor
activity. For instance, the positional isomers in Table 10 show
dramatic differences in cytotoxicity. Table 11 exemplifies what
changes in stereochemistry can have on cytotoxicity. The
a-orientation at C-8 in gaillardin (94) shows more cytotoxicity than
the 8-orientation found in neogaillardin (95).
Some definite trends can be derived from the data presented
above. The germacranolides appear to be the most promising group in
which to find antineoplastic compounds. A compound from this class
should ideally have a relatively high anti-tumor activity at a dose
of low cytotoxicity. Detailed structure-activity studies on
126 131
sesquiterpene lactones are limited and only one recent study
130
involved derivatives of a germacranolide sesquiterpene lactone.
In this study, three structurally related germacranolide esters,

eriofertin (96), eriofertopin (97), and deacetyleupaserrin (98), were 
examined for correlation between structural features and in vivo 
activity. Results of their study showed that acetylation had a
pronounced negative effect on antileukemic activity, suggesting that 
the alcohol functions contributed in some way to the in vivo activity 
of these compounds. It was concluded that the a-methylene-butyro- 
lactone ring was alone not sufficient for antileukemic activity among 
the germacranolides examined. From this study, we felt that a more 
varied group of germacranolides needed to be systematically derivatized 
and tested. Since this class of sesquiterpene lactones shows the most 
promise of producing antineoplastic agents, a series of esters of 
four structurally varied germacranolides were chosen to be synthesized 
and tested. In section lib the reasons for selecting ester 
derivatives will be commented upon. Hopefully, differences in cyto­
toxicity or anti-tumor activity would yield much valuable information

about what effect functionality about the basic germacranolide

lib. Synthesis of Germacranolide Esters
It was of interest to examine a series of esters of 
germacranolide sesquiterpene lactones for any correlations between 
structural changes and biological activity. A series of esters of 
varying chain length was synthesized to determine whether the increase 
in lipophilicity, with increase in ester chain length, would affect 
the biological activities of the germacranolide sesquiterpene 
lactones. Increased lipophilicity should aid in penetration of the 
cell membrane by the sesquiterpene lactone and hopefully increase its 
antineoplastic activity. Since increased membrane permeability should 
also increase cytotoxicity,^ we hoped to find the correct chain 
length to increase lipophilicity without significantly increasing 
cytotoxicity. Put another way, we hoped to maximize anti-tumor 
activity while keeping cytotoxicity to a minimum. Two ester 
derivatives, methacrylate and cinnamate, were chosen to be 
synthesized for different reasons. It was thought that these two 
ester functions should provide a second site for alkylation and 
thereby increase biological activity. The ester series that was 
chosen included acetate, isobutyrate, hexanoate, palmitate, 
methacrylate, and cinnamate.
The four germacranolides to be derivatized, melampodin B (86), 
melcanthin B (99), melampodin A (100), and cinerenin (101), were 
selected for a number of reasons. First, these germacranolides were
(9 9 ) (!£P> ( 1 0 0
available in quantities sufficient to carry out all of the proposed 
esterifications. Secondly, the four sesquiterpenes had been tested 
previously at NCI and had shown varying activities (Table 12). Lastly, 
these compounds are structurally varied yet all contain an 
esterifiable alcohol function.

Following initial synthetic attempts to prepare the ester
derivatives, it became obvious that the methacrylate and cinnamate
esters posed problems. Previous work described in the literature
indicated that the yields of formation of methacrylate esters were
134-136
unexceptionally low. Therefore melampodin B (§6) was selected
as a model compound for the methacrylate ester synthesis studies 
because of the availability of relatively large quantities of this 
compound. The first attempt to synthesize melampodin B methacrylate 
utilized the classical method of ester preparation. Reaction of 
methacrylolyl chloride and (86) in pyridine produced the C-15 meth­
acrylate ester in very low yield.
The catalyst 4-dimethylaminopyridine (102) has been used with

u u- j j 137,138good success to synthesize sterically hindered esters.
Formation of the reactive acylpyridinium intermediate enables
4-dimethylaminopyridine to function as an extremely good catalyst for
the esterification of even highly sterically hindered alcohols. The
attempted synthesis of melampodin B methacrylate using (102) as a
catalyst, again yielded mostly unreacted starting material (86).
139Takimoto et al. reported that the addition of silver 
cyanide to various esterification reactions improved the yields
94
dramatically. This is thought to be due to the complexation of the 
chloride group on the acid chloride with the silver ion prior to 
reaction with the alcohol. Addition of silver cyanide to the reaction 
mixture of (86) and methacryloyl chloride showed only trace amounts 
of product ester in the NMR spectrum, while unreacted (86) appeared 
to be the major constituent of the reaction mixture.
A facile synthesis of methacrylate esters employing meth-
° 140
acryloyl chloride and 3 A molecular sieves was recently reported.
The authors claimed that the molecular sieves, if powdered and dried
under vacuum with heat, would act as efficient scavengers of small
molecules such as H^O and HC1. Both of these compounds would
interfere with the esterification by either hydrolysis of the acid
chloride and/or polymerization of the extremely reactive methacryloyl
chloride, lowering the yield of the esterification reaction. In
O
model reactions with 3 A molecular sieves, good yields of methacrylate 
esters were reported with such alcohols as cyclopentanol (95%) and 
3-methyl-3-pentanol (50%). Applying these conditions in the 
melampodin B methacrylate reaction did not noticably improve the 
yields.
At this point the synthesis of the methacrylate esters for 
the series was temporarily abandoned. An alternative method would 
have to be found that would yield the methacrylate ester without 
using the extremely reactive methacryloyl chloride. Two viable 
protection methods can be seen in the schemes below. In Scheme XXXII 
the B-bromo acid chloride is reacted with the appropriate alcohol
95
to form the S-bromo ester. This ester could dehydrobrominate to 
yield the methacrylate ester. Scheme XXXIII approaches this

synthesis from a slightly different angle. Methacrylic acid is 
reacted with dimethylamine in a Michael addition to form the S-amino 
acid. This acid is reacted with the appropriate alcohol in the 
presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or some other suitable condensing 
agent to yield the S-amino ester. Methylation of the amine function
with methyl iodide followed by loss of quarternary amine in a Hoffmann-
3
type elimination should yield the methacrylate ester.
Synthesis of the cinnamate ester presented many of the same 
problems as those encountered with the methacrylate synthesis. The 
desired products were obtained in low yields with the exception of 
cinerenin cinnamate. The details of the synthesis of this compound 
will be presented below and in the experimental section of this 
dissertation.
Initially, the reaction method chosen for the synthesis of 
the desired germacranolide ester derivatives involved reaction of 
commercially available acid chloride with the medium ring alcohol in 
pyridine. This approach presented two problems. The yields of 
esters using this procedure were rather low with the exception of 
the acetate formation which could in part be due to the steric 
hindrance of the secondary alcohols. But probably a more important 
factor contributing to the low yield reactions is the partial 
solubility of the ester products in the aqueous phase. Another 
problem encountered in this synthetic procedure was a side reaction 
involving ester functions already present in the starting compounds. 
Upon examination of the product of the reaction of melampodin B with 
isobutyryl chloride in pyridine, it was evident from the NMR spectrum 
[product (1£4) in Table 14] that the allylic acetate group present at 
C-l in (86) had been replaced by an isobutyrate moiety. This 
exchange reaction is probably base-catalyzed as seen below in 
Scheme XXXIV.

SCHEME XXXI V
Because of the problems discussed before, an alternative
synthetic approach to the desired esters was chosen. The method
127
previously used by Lee and coworkers in the synthesis of ester
derivatives of the pseudoguaianolide helenalin (92), was tested on the
medium ring compounds. Combining the appropriate acid chloride and
alcohol (1.5:1.0) in refluxing benzene gave good yields of the
desired esters with no exchange reaction. A list of the esters
synthesized can be seen in Table 13. The experimental details of
their syntheses are summarized in Part IV on pages 171-186 and the
physical parameters (IR, UV, and CD) of the derivatives are presented
in tabular form in Part IV on pages 175-183. The IR of the ester
-1
derivatives lacked the OH absorption at 3400 cm and showed ester 
carbonyl absorption at 1730-1750 cm \
^H-NMR and mass spectral data of the prepared esters are 
summarized in Tables 14-21. Comparison of the ^H-NMR and mass 
spectral data of the derivatives with the spectra of the original 
compounds indicated that the desired esters had been obtained and no 
exchange processes with other ester functions had occurred. The

■^H-NMR spectra of the four known starting germacranolides are included 
in Figures 11-14 for convenient reference. The C-15 protons that 
occurred at approximately 4.1 ppm in the starting alcohols were 
shifted downfield to approximately 4.6 ppm upon esterification. The 
secondary alcohol function at C-2 in melcanthin B was also esterified 
and the C-2 proton that occurred at 4.6 ppm in the parent compound 
appeared near 5.6 ppm in the ester. The sole alcohol moiety in 
melampodin A is the secondary alcohol at C-9. In the parent compound 
H-9 had a chemical shift of 4.0 ppm while in the ester derivatives of 
melampodin A, H-9 absorbed downfield to about 5.4 ppm. These down­
field shifts are strong evidence for ester formation. The appearance 
in the ester NMR spectra of signals attributable to protons on the 
ester moiety, together with the mass spectral fragmentation patterns 
associated with these ester functions, provided additional evidence 
to support ester formation. Scheme XXXV illustrates the common mass 
spectral fragmentation patterns of the various ester moieties.
Acetates of all four germacranolides were synthesized. The 
sharp three-proton singlet at about 2.0 ppm in the ^H-NMR indicated 
the presence of an acetate function. Melampodin B and melcanthin B 
both contained acetates in the original compounds. Integration of 
the singlet at 2.0 ppm accounted for two acetate methyls in these 
acetate derivatives. The mass spectra of all the acetate derivatives 
showed large peaks at m/z 43, indicating the loss of 02^ 0 . The loss 
of acetic acid (m/z 60) via a McLafferty rearrangement was evident in 
the mass spectra of the acetate esters (Scheme XXXV).

Melampodin B and cinerenin were the only two germacranolides
forming isobutyrate esters in good yields. The secondary alcohol 
functions on melcanthin B and melampodin A may be too sterically 
hindered to react efficiently with the more bulky isobutyryl chloride. 
The NMR spectra of melampodin B and cinerenin isobutyrate contained 
the typical doublet near 1.1 ppm due to the two isobutyryl methyls.
The heptet at about 2.6 ppm was assigned to the a-hydrogen of the 
ester in both spectra. The mass spectra of the two isobutyrates had 
base peaks at m/z 71, indicating the expected acylium ion (C^H^O)
(see Scheme XXXV). Also, McLafferty rearrangement was again evident 
in the mass spectra by the appearance of peaks at M-8 8 .
synthesized without any difficulty. Referring to the hexanoate 
moiety below, the triplet representing the methylene protons adjacent
to the carbonyl group (a-hydrogens) appeared at approximately 2.35 ppm. 
The remaining protons in the ester group (b-hydrogens) occurred at 
two multiplets, one near 0.90 ppm and an envelope at about 1.3 ppm.
In melcanthin B hexanoate all these signals were integrated in agree­
ment with formation of the diester. Mass spectral fragmentation 
patterns also supported formation of the hexanoate ester (see
Scheme XXXV). Loss of the acylium ion (C,H-.,0) resulted in very

strong peaks at m/z 99, which was the base peak in both melampodin B 
and cinerenin hexanoate, and m/z 71, which was assigned to the loss 
of CijihQ from the hexanoate side chain. The loss of hexanoic acid 
via McLafferty rearrangement was evident from the appearance of an 
M-116 peak.
Only melampodin B and cinerenin were converted to the 
palmitate ester derivatives. The ^H-NMR spectra of these two esters 
showed the triplet at about 2.25 ppm assigned to the methylene 
protons adjacent to the carbonyl group. The remaining protons in the 
palmitate function occurred as an envelope centered near 1.25 ppm.
The mass spectral fragmentation patterns of the palmitate esters 
showed typical long chain hydrocarbon fragmentations (see Scheme XXXV). 
Loss of fragments differing by 14 mass units (CH^) of the long 
hydrocarbon backbone was apparent by fairly intense peaks at m/z 43 
(-C3H 7), m/z 57 (-C4H 9), m/z 71 ( - C ^ ) ,  and m/z 85 (-C6H13>.
Cinerenin palmitate contained the molecular ion for the ester 
derivative at m/z 558. The base peak in melampodin B palmitate at 
m/z 73 appeared to result from the loss of propanoic acid from the 
palmitate side chain via a McLafferty-type process.
As stated previously, the only cinnamate ester synthesized 
was cinerenin cinnamate. Evidence of the formation of cinerenin 
cinnamate was found in the ^H-NMR spectrum of the ester. The 
appearance of aromatic signals at about 7.5 ppm along with the 
signals for the a- and (3-protons at approximately 6.46 and 7.77 ppm, 
respectively, indicated the presence of the cinnamate moiety. This
data was supported by the mass spectral data which showed a molecular 
ion peak at m/z 450. Loss of m/z 77 (-C^H^), m/z 103 (-CgH^), 
m/z 131 (CgH^O), and m/z 147 (C^H^C^) are all indicative of the 
cinnamic acid ester function (see Scheme XXXV).
Further experimental details on all of the above 
esterifications can be found in Part IV of this dissertation.
lie. Biological Activity of Germacranolides and Their Derivatives
The four germacranolides, melampodin B, cinerenin, melampodin 
A, and melcanthin B, have all been tested under the auspices of the 
National Cancer Institute. The results of these tests and of the 
testing that has been carried out so far on some of the derivatives of 
these compounds are shown in Table 12. The derivatives that were 
described in the previous section were submitted to NCI to be tested 
for cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity. Unfortunately when these 
derivatives were tested, the control was bad and all the results had 
to be voided. Because of the time involved in resynthesizing these 
derivatives and in resubmitting the samples, results are still not 
unavailable on most of these compounds.
From the data available, it is apparent that the acetate of 
melampodin A had a significant increase in activity over the parent 
compound. There could be many reasons for this change in activity. 
Possibly the less polar ester can more easily penetrate cell membranes 
to where it is needed to exert its biological effect. Another 
interpretation could be that the ester at C-9 is known to exchange 
under basic conditions in compounds such as melampodin A. Possibly
122
the less acetate exchanged and was replaced by another fatty acid.
This could greatly enhance the ability of the compound to penetrate 
the fatty acid layer of the cell membrane, again enabling the compound 
to exert its maximum effect. The decrease in polarity afforded by the 
ester function could also explain the increase in activity of 
cinerenin hexanoate over that of cinerenin.
A plot of PS-activity versus dose level for melampodin A 
(100), melampodin A acetate (115)> and the structurally related 
germacranolide melamopidinin (117) is seen in Figure 15. The same 
trend was observed for the lactones in Figures 8 and 9 reappears.

A maximal dose level exists for each of the three compounds, 10 mg/kg. 
Once this dosage level is exceeded, PS-activity drops off rapidly.
Again the close interplay between cytotoxicity and antineoplastic 
activity is quite apparent.
Fortunately, small amounts of each ester derivative synthesized 
had been set aside for biological testing with the enzyme phospho- 
fructokinase. The results of these tests will be discussed in Part III.

An Inhibition Study of 
Phosphof rue tokinase 
With Germacranolide Sesquiterpene Lactones
124
125
In previous studies directed towards the mechanism of action
X16of anti-tumor active sesquiterpene lactones, three compounds had 
been tested as possible inhibitors of the enzyme PFK. The sesqui­
terpene lactones, vernolepin (54), euparotin acetate (79) and 
eupacunin (80) were found to inhibit the enzyme. Treatment of these 
inhibitors with an excess of dithiothreitol prior to reaction with 
enzyme rendered them ineffective in inhibiting enzyme activity. This 
indicated that these compounds could be inhibiting PFK because of 
their affinity for the sulfhydryl groups at the active site. A 
Michael-type addition of the sulfhydryl group or groups to a site or 
sites of unsaturation on the sesquiterpene lactone appears to render 
the enzyme inactive. A similar addition could occur with sulfhydryl 
groups present in a protein or enzyme involved in the cell division 
p r o c e s s . T h i s  could render a key intermediate in cell division 
inactive which would account not only for the anti-tumor activity, 
but also for the cytotoxicity of these compounds.
The following section of this dissertation describes the
testing of a number of germacranolide sesquiterpene lactones with
PFK. A different and more sensitive method of testing for enzyme
116inhibition was employed than that used by the previous workers.
It was hoped that by testing a group of structurally related 
compounds that some structural feature could be related to the 
■ . biological activity of these natural products. With this goal in
mind, the series of ester derivatives of melampodin B (86), melcanthin 
B (99), melampodin A (100)„ and cinerenin (101) were tested for their
126
inhibitory effects on PFK. In addition to the ester derivatives of 
melampodin A, two other structurally related compounds, enhydrin A 
(118) and melampodinin (117), were also tested with PFK.

Finally, three structurally similar cis,cis-germacranolides, 
melcanthin A (32), melcanthin D (83), and melcanthin E (84), were 
tested for their relative abilities to inhibit PFK.
Following the completion of the inhibition studies of PFK 
with the sesquiterpene lactones, an attempt was made to discover 
whether there was any correlation between the anti-tumor activity 
data obtained from NCI and the results of the inhibition studies 
with PFK.

Ilia. Phosphofructokinase
Phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phospho-
transferase, EC 2.7.1.11; hereafter PFK) catalyzes the phosphorylation
of fructose-6-phosphate by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce
fructose-1,6-diphosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (see Scheme
XXII). PFK can be easily isolated in pure form from a variety of
sources. Skeletal muscle PFK has a sedimentation pattern that is
141-142
indicative of the enzyme undergoing self-association. Rabbit
muscle PFK aggregation is known to be dependent on protein
, „ 143-145 , .concentration and pH. The state of aggregation is also
146
affected by various effectors of the enzyme. The stability of the
enzyme is dependent on the aggregation state of the enzyme. The loss
of activity of PFK upon dilution can be explained by a deaggregation
112
favored by low protein concentration. The smallest fully active
enzyme (13S) consists of four subunits. Each protomer contains 16-18
sulfhydryl groups.-^3,147 ^  found that 60% of the enzyme's
activity was lost by alkylation of six of the sulfhydryl groups with
iodoacetamide (81). Fructose-6-phosphate and magnesium ATP protected
the enzyme against this loss of activity.
PFK was chosen as the enzyme to employ with sesquiterpene
lactones to study their enzyme inhibitory effects for a number of
reasons. First, some initial work had been done with PFK and
116 148sesquiterpene lactones, ’ which gave some indication that these 
compounds were indeed good inhibitors of PFK, but no inhibition 
constants had been calculated. Secondly, it had been postulated that
128
sesquiterpene lactones exerted many biological activities by combining 
with sulfhydryl-containing proteins. Since PFK is known to have 
sulfhydryl groups at its active site, the reaction of these lactones 
with PFK could serve as a model reaction for what actually occurs in 
vivo. Moreover, PFK is the key regulatory enzyme of the glycolytic 
pathway which provides energy to the cell in the form of ATP. ATP 
is essential for all endergonic, i.e. thermodynamically unfavorable, 
reactions in living organisms. Also, PFK is unique in having 
several specific regulatory sites on the enzyme besides its active 
site. These regulatory sites bind physiological ligands, either 
inhibitors or activators, in a specific fashion. Lastly, PFK was 
selected because the enzyme was readily available in purified form 
and could be easily assayed for enzymatic activity.
Illb. PFK Inhibition Study of Sesquiterpene Lactones
Twenty-two germacranolide sesquiterpene lactones were tested 
as possible inhibitors of PFK. The method of assay of enzyme 
activity was the spectrophometric method of Ling et This
method of assaying activity is described in the experimental section 
of this dissertation. Apparent inhibition constants, abbreviated 
apparent K., were calculated for each sesquiterpene lactone tested. 
This was accomplished by varying the concentration of the inhibitor 
while keeping the concentrations of the remaining reagents the same. 
For each inhibitor concentration, a percent inhibition was obtained. 
The percent inhibition was then plotted against the final
129
concentration of the inhibitor in the reaction mixture. From this 
plot, the concentration of the inhibitor that would yield 50% 
inhibition was calculated. This concentration is defined as the 
apparent K^. The lower the value of the apparent K^, the better the 
inhibition of PFK or the enzyme being examined. The plots from 
which the apparent values of each sesquiterpene lactone were 
calculated are shown in Figures 16-37.
Examining the data for the derivative series of melampodin B, 
melampodin A, melcanthin B, and cinerenin showed some very interest­
ing trends. Table 22 contains the inhibition results for melampodin B 
and its ester derivatives. The best inhibitor of this series is 
melampodin B hexanoate while the least effective inhibitor against 
PFK is the parent compound, melampodin B. Melampodin B hexanoate is 
approximately two and a half times more effective as an inhibitor of 
PFK than is melampodin B. In fact, as the polarity of the compounds 
decreases from melampodin B to melampodin B hexanoate, the effective­
ness of the compound as an inhibitor of PFK increases. But the least 
polar derivative, melampodin B palmitate, does not fall within this 
trend. A possible explanation for the trend observed with melampodin B 
and its derivatives and for the exception to this trend will be 
presented below.
Data from the inhibition studies of cinerenin and its ester 
derivatives are seen in Table 23. As in the melampodin B series, the 
most effective inhibitor is the hexanoate ester, while cinerenin has 
the highest apparent K^ value. Cinerenin hexanoate inhibits PFK

nearly four times as effectively as does the parent compound, 
cinerenin. The same trend as was seen with melampodin B and its 
derivatives is present within the cinerenin series. As polarity of 
the compounds decreases from cinerenin to cinerenin hexanoate, the 
ability to inhibit PFK increases. But again the palmitate ester 
breaks the trend, exhibiting an apparent value greater than that 
of cinerenin hexanoate. Cinerenin was the only sesquiterpene lactone 
in which the cinnamate ester was synthesized. Although this 
derivative had been expected to be a potent inhibitor due to the 
presence of a second Michael receptor, its apparent K_^  was not 
comparatively small. Some possible reasons for these observations 
will be presented following presentation of all the inhibition data 
for the series.
Melampodin B (86) and cinerenin (101) differ structurally 
only in the function at C-l, an acetate in (86) and an ethoxide in 
(101). Comparing the data in Tables 22 and 23, it seems that all of 
the melampodin B compounds are better inhibitors of PFK than are the 
cinerenin compounds. One could attribute this difference in activity 
to the presence of an ester function at C-l in (86) as opposed to an 
ether function as in (101).
Only two ester derivatives were synthesized from melampodin A. 
The apparent K^ values of these three compounds are seen in Table 24. 
Again, the hexanoate ester gave the lowest apparent K^ and 
melampodin A had the highest value. The least polar compound in this 
series was the most potent inhibitor of PFK.

The last series of esters synthesized for this study is shown 
in Table 25. Melcanthin B is the least effective inhibitor of PFK, 
while the hexanoate ester is the most effective of the three 
compounds. Melcanthin B hexanoate inhibits PFK almost four times as 
strongly as the parent compound, melcanthin B, and almost three times 
as strongly as melcanthin B acetate. As the melcanthin compounds 
become more non-polar they become better enzyme inhibitors.
To understand the trends within the above lactone series, it 
would be advantageous to consider briefly the environment around the 
enzyme active site. It is known that the active sites of most 
enzymes are located in what is termed cleft regions of the enzyme. 
These cleft regions are formed by an enzyme in aqueous medium due 
to the orientation of the polar side chains of its amino acid 
residues towards the more polar surface of the enzyme and the 
orientation of the non-polar side chains inwards, away from the 
polar medium. When these non-polar groups orient inwards, pockets 
are formed that are referred to as clefts (see Figure 38). These

cleft regions are relatively non-polar and have strict spatial 
considerations and stereospecificity. If the sulfhydryl groups that 
the sesquiterpene lactones are to react with are located within this 
cleft near the active site, then the polarity trend observed can be 
easily explained. As the polarity of a compound decreases, the 
repulsive forces of the less polar cleft region of the enzyme also 
decreases. Therefore one should expect more efficient inhibition 
from the less polar ester derivatives, which is in agreement with the 
experimentally observed data. Similar considerations are applicable 
to the dozen specific regulatory sites of PFK. In reference to the 
palmitate esters being less effective inhibitors than the hexanoate 
esters, although being less polar, the following can be used as an 
explanation. Since there is usually a very strict spatial requirement 
within the clefts of an enzyme, it is possible that the long-chain 
palmitate ester for steric reasons cannot easily reach the active 
site in order to react with the sulfhydryl groups. It would be
interesting to test some ester derivatives intermediate in size and
polarity between the hexanoate and the palmitate esters. Results of 
such tests may reveal more details as to exactly how structural 
contributions affect activity. The disappointingly low inhibition of 
PFK by cinerenin cinnamate could also be explained by the inability 
of this bulkier ester to react efficiently with the sulfhydryl groups
located in the cleft region of the enzyme.
Two additional series of structurally related germacranolides 
were also tested for inhibition of PFK. The first of these series is
159
seen in Table 26. Three naturally occurring cis,cis-germacranolides, 
melcanthin A, D, and E, that differ only by the ester side chain 
present at carbon-8, were isolated from a crude plant extract that 
was anti-tumor active. These three lactones were indeed inhibitors 
of PFK, with the methacrylate ester showing the greatest inhibition.
In terms of polarity, the trend observed with these cis,cis compounds 
is opposite to what was observed for the synthetic esters. Based on 
previous findings with methacrylate-containing sesquiterpene lactones, 
it was predicted that the methacrylate ester should be the most 
anti-tumor active of the three compounds because of the additional 
site of unsaturation for Michael addition provided by the reactive 
ester group. This second Michael receptor could also make the 
methacrylate a better inhibitor of PFK by providing an additional 
electrophilic site for the reaction of the sulfhydryl groups of PFK.
The last group of structurally related sesquiterpene 
lactones to be tested on PFK are shown in Table 27. Two of the 
compounds in this series have been examined in Table 23 as part of 
the synthetic ester series. But these two compounds, melampodin A 
and melampodin A acetate, will also be examined here because they are 
both naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactones as are the 
structurally related enhydrin A and melampodinin. As seen previously 
in Table 23, the acetate ester increases the inhibition of PFK 
significantly over the parent alcohol. Addition of another epoxide 
function to the melampodin A skeleton, as in enhydrin A, does not 
improve the PFK inhibitory ability. In fact, enhydrin A is less

potent as an inhibitor than both melampodin A and its acetate. The 
least potent inhibitor of PFK is melampodinin (Table 27). This 
germacranolide has no epoxide function in its side chain but contains 
the 2,3-epoxide as did all previous compounds. These data suggest 
that the 2,3-epoxide function has no major influence on the ability 
of germacranolides to inhibit PFK. But the presence of the epoxide 
function in the C-8 side chain is of greater importance in enzyme 
inhibition by these natural products. It is possible that the epoxide 
in the side chain at C-8 is providing an additional electrophilic 
site for attack by the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme.
IIIc. Correlation Between PFK Inhibition and Cytotoxic and/or 
Anti-Tumor Activity
It has been demonstrated that germacranolide sesquiterpene 
lactones are potent inhibitors of the enzyme PFK. The question of 
whether there is any correlation between enzyme inhibition and the 
cytotoxic or antireoplastic properties of these compounds can be 
studied by comparing the inhibition data with results of testing for 
cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity.
Table 28 shows the nine sesquiterpene lactones that have been 
tested for antineoplastic activity (PS) and for PFK inhibition. The 
PS activity is expressed in T/C values, where a higher T/C value 
indicates a more anti-tumor active compound. PFK inhibition is 
expressed as an apparent K_^ , where a lower apparent K^ value indicates 
greater inhibition of PFK. The data in Table 28 suggest that there 
exists a correlation within the ester series of melampodin B,

melampodin A, and cinerenin. In each case, the ester represents the 
more antineoplastic compound. Melampodin B and melampodin B acetate 
do not show significant differences in either anti-tumor activity or 
PFK inhibition. However, in the pair cinerenin:cinerenin hexanoate, 
the hexanoate ester shows considerably greater anti-tumor activity. 
This same trend is repeated in the PFK inhibition data for the 
cinerenins. Melampodin A acetate is noticably more active against 
tumors than melampodin A, a trend echoed again in the PFK data, with 
melampodin A acetate possessing an apparent K_^  that is lower than the 
apparent K^ for melampodin A.
It is evident that of the four related sesquiterpenes, 
melampodin A, melampodin A acetate, enhydrin A, and melampodinin, 
melampodinin shows the highest antineoplastic activity in this group, 
but it is the least potent inhibitor of PFK. The data for melampodin 
A, melampodin A acetate, and enhydrin A do seem to correlate quite 
well. The discrepancy in the melampodinin results cannot be easily 
rationalized at this point, but will be commented upon below.
Comparing the data on all nine compounds in Table 28, there 
does not appear to be any correlation other than that within the 
series of structurally related lactones. Since only a small number 
of sesquiterpene lactones have been compared to date, it is probably 
too early to draw any conclusions concerning the existence of a 
correlation between anti-tumor activity and inhibition of PFK. 
Certainly more compounds will have to be tested on both systems before 
trends can be recognized that either favor or disfavor correlation.
165
It was hoped that all the synthetic ester derivatives that were 
tested for PFK inhibition would also be tested for antineoplastic 
activities at NCI. However, due to an invalid control when these 
samples were tested at NCI, the results were inconclusive. Most of 
the synthetic ester derivatives have been resubmitted for anti-tumor 
tests, but these results are still pending.
It may prove that there exists closer relationships between 
PFK inhibition data of sesquiterpene lactones and cytotoxicity rather 
than anti-tumor activity. Most of the lactones tested at NCI have 
been found to be cytotoxic. In fact a larger percentage of 
sesquiterpene lactones are classified as cytotoxic agents rather than 
as anti-tumor agents. It is indeed possible, if not highly probable, 
that this high cytotoxicity could be a direct reflection of the 
potent inhibition of PFK. Since PFK is an important control enzyme 
in glycolysis, deactivation of PFK would shut down glycolysis. Once 
the energy-producing cycle of the cell is stopped, or slowed 
sufficiently, the cell cannot continue to live.
Anti-tumor activity is a more complex phenomenon than that 
occurring in a single purified enzyme system. Anti-tumor activity is 
dependent on many biochemical characteristics, such as transport of 
the compound into the cell, possible modification of the compound to 
form the actual anti-tumor agent, and reaction of the lactones with 
more than one protein in the malignant cell. The possibility also 
exists that PFK from various tissues and/or species may have different 
sensitivities towards the inhibitory sesquiterpene lactones. Thus,
166
it is no surprise to find anti-tumor activity, measured in vivo, and 
PFK inhibition, measured in vitro, are not highly correlatable. Nor 
is it surprising to find "anomalous" data as in Table 28.

IVa. Isolation of Melcanthin A (32), Melcanthin D (83), and 
Melcanthin E (84)
A collection of Melampodium cineveum D.C., var. cineveum3 
was made on July 19, 1973, 8.6 miles northeast of Hebbronville, Duval 
County, Texas on route 359 (T. F. Stuessy and N. H. Fischer 11 2015).
The voucher is deposited at the Ohio State University Herbarium, 
Columbus, Ohio.
Dried leaves (1450 g) were ground in a Waring blender with 
cold chloroform. After filtration by suction and re-extraction of 
the residue, the combined chloroform extracts were evaporated in vacuo. 
The green residue was dissolved in a sufficient amount of ethanol and 
then an equal volume of an aqueous 5% lead (II) acetate solution was 
added. The precipitate was removed by filtration over celite and the 
filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to remove most of the ethanol. The 
residual aqueous phase was extracted exhaustively with chloroform 
and dried with anhydrous MgSO^. Removal of the solvent left the 
crude terpenoid-containing syrup.
The crude syrup (5 g) was chromatographed over 250 g of 
Brinkman silica gel 60 (particle size 0.063-0.2 mm; 70-230 mesh ASTM) 
collecting approximately 25 ml fractions. The solvent used to elute 
the column was n-propyl acetate. Fractions were collected and 
combined according to TLC analysis. Fractions 28-37 (800 mg) were 
further purified by thick layer chromatography with 90% diethyl ether- 
10% hexane as the eluting solvent. Four bands were obtained, two of 
which were chromatographed on a high pressure liquid chromatograph.
170
The column employed was a Waters C.0-bondapak reverse phase column
lo
(7.8 mm ID x 30 cm), and 50% methanol-50% water by volume was used
as solvent in the separations. About eight milligrams of each of
the three pure cis,cis-germacranolides were obtained.

IVb. Synthesis of Various Ester Derivatives of Natural Products
Two methods of esterification were employed in the synthesis 
of a number of ester derivatives of melampodin B (86), melcanthin B 
(99), melampodin A (100), and cinerenin (101). These two methods are 
described below.
Method A . A known amount of sesquiterpene lactone was
O
dissolved in redistilled pyridine which had been stored over 4 A 
molecular sieves. Excess acetic anhydride was added dropwise and the 
reaction mixture was allowed to be stirred overnight at room 
temperature. The resultant solution was evaporated under reduced 
pressure to yield a crystalline residue. These crystals were 
triturated with aqueous HC1 (10%) and extracted several times with 
CHCl^. The combined CHCl^ extracts were dried over MgSO^ for 1 hour, 
filtered, and evaporated to yield crystalline product. The product 
was recrystallized or purified by thick layer chromatography and 
characterized by NMR (Tables 14, 16, 18, and 20), MS (Tables 15, 17, 
19, and 21), IR (Tables 31-34), UV (Tables 35, 37, 39, and 41), and 
CD (Tables 36, 38, 40, and 42). The esters which were synthesized 
by this method are listed in Table 29.
Method B . To a known amount of sesquiterpene lactone 
dissolved in approximately 10 ml of dry, distilled benzene (stored
O
over 4 A molecular sieves) was added dropwise a lh~ to 2-fold excess 
of acid chloride. The reaction mixture was refluxed until the 
reaction was shown to be complete by thin layer chromatography. The 
reaction mixture was filtered and then washed with 5% NaHCO^ and

saturated NaCl. The combined benzene washings were dried with Na^SO^ 
overnight, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield 
crystalline product. Further purification was effected by 
recrystallization or by thick layer or column chromatography, followed 
by characterization by NMR (Tables 14, 16, 18, and 20), MS (Tables 15, 
17, 19, and 21), IR (Tables 31-34), UV (Tables 35, 37, 39, and 41), 
and CD (Tables 36, 38, 40, and 42). The esters synthesized by method 
B are listed in Table 30.
Reaction of melampodin B and methacryloyl chloride in pyridine. 
To 110 mg (0.33 mmoles) of melampodin B, dissolved in approximately 
3 ml of pyridine, was added dropwise at 0°C an ethereal solution con­
taining 0.03 ml of methacryloyl chloride. The reaction mixture was 
stirred at room temperature for about four hours. A yellow, water- 
soluble gum formed during the reaction and was filtered off. The 
ether solution was then extracted five times with 25 ml portions of 
dilute HC1 followed by two washings with saturated NaHCO^. The 
combined ether extracts were dried over MgSO^ for one-half hour and 
evaporated under reduced pressure to yield white crystals. An NMR 
spectrum of these crystals indicated only unreacted starting material.
Reaction of melampodin B and methacryloyl chloride with the 
catalyst 4-dimethylaminopyridine. To 80 mg (0.3 mmoles) of 
melampodin B dissolved in 5 ml of pyridine was added at 0°C 0.04 ml 
of methacryloyl chloride in ether over a fifteen minute period. Then, 
approximately 75 mg of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.6 mmoles) were 
added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6
185
hours and then left overnight in the refrigerator. Filtration and 
evaporation under reduced pressure yielded off-white crystals. A 
slurry of the crystals and 25 ml of aqueous HC1 (10%) were extracted 
with three portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts 
were dried over MgSO^ and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield 
white crystals which were shown by ^H-NMR to be unreacted starting 
material.
Synthesis of silver cyanide. A potassium cyanide solution 
(1.95 g in 50 ml of li^ O) was combined with a silver nitrate solution 
(5.1 g in 100 ml of ^ 0 )  at room temperature. The silver cyanide 
precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with water. The 
catalyst was then dried in vaauo at 2 mm Hg for approximately 12 
hours.
Reaction of melampodin B and methacryloyl chloride with the 
catalyst silver cyanide. Melampodin B (83 mg, 0.3 mmoles) was 
dissolved in 5 ml of acetonitrile under slight heating. Silver 
cyanide (0.134 g, 1.0 mmole) was added to the solution of melampodin 
B at room temperature. With stirring, 0.05 ml of methacryloyl 
chloride was added to this solution with the aid of a microsyringe. 
This mixture was stirred at room temperature until the reaction 
appeared complete by TLC (68 hours). The mixture was filtered and 
the solvent removed to yield white crystals which were impure by TLC 
analysis. Silica gel column chromatography of the reaction mixture 
resulted in a very small amount of the desired product as shown by 
1H-NMR.
Reaction of melampodin B and methacryloyl chloride with 3 A
molecular sieves. To 100 mg (0.3 mmoles) of melampodin B and 200 mg
O
of powdered 3 A molecular sieves in acetonitrile was added 0.03 ml of 
methacryloyl chloride. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 
approximately 1 hour, stirred at room temperature for 36 hours, 
filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crystalline 
product was shown to be unreacted starting material by ^H-NMR.
IVc. Phosphofructokinase Assay System
The inhibition studies of sesquiterpene lactones with 
phosphofructokinase (PFK) were all carried out using a modified 
procedure of Ling et A reaction mixture is made up as seen
in Table 43. The reaction mixture, excluding the substrate, 
fructose-6-phosphate, was incubated for ten minutes. The reaction 
was initiated after this period of time by the addition of an 
appropriate amount of fructose-6-phosphate. This assay mixture was 
run in a 1 cm light path curvette kept at 28°C. The reaction rate 
was proportional to the change in optical density at 340 nm. Each 
inhibitor was run against a control and percent inhibition is defined 
as the relative rates of reaction with and without inhibitor.
Table 9 contains all the inhibitors tested, the concentrations 
employed, and their percent inhibition. All sesquiterpene lactone 
samples tested were either solids or gums, and were dissolved in 
spectograde methanol. The control sample contained an equal amount 
of methanol.

Auxiliary enzyme mixture. The auxiliary enzyme mixture was 
prepared as follows:
1 part stock lactate dehydrogenase
1 part stock pyruvate kinase
3 parts 0.25 M tris-chloride buffer, pH = 7.8
Phosphofructokinase. Phosphofructokinase is diluted as the 
stock enzyme with a dilution buffer prepared as follows. To prepare 
10 ml of dilution buffer, combine 5 ml of 0.1 M tris-phosphate 
buffer, pH = 8.0 with 2 mM EDTA, 1 ml of 0.1% bovine serum albumin,
0.5 ml of 0.024 M o-phenanthroline, and 3.5 ml of water. A 100-fold 
dilution of PFK is prepared with 0.010 ml of stock rabbit muscle PFK 
and 0.990 ml of the dilution buffer described above. Further 
dilutions are made until the proper rate of the enzyme reaction, 
without inhibitors, is established.
