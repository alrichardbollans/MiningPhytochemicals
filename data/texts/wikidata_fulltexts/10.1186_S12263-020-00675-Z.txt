Manach5AbstractGrapes and berries are two types of widely consumed fruits characterized by a high content in differentphytochemicals. However, their accurate dietary assessment is particularly arduous, because of the already widerecognized bias associated with self-reporting methods, combined with the large range of species and cultivars andthe fact that these fruits are popularly consumed not only in fresh and frozen forms but also as processed andderived products, including dried and canned fruits, beverages, jams, and jellies. Reporting precise type and/orquantity of grape and berries in FFQ or diaries can obviously be affected by errors. Recently, biomarkers of foodintake (BFIs) rose as a promising tool to provide accurate information indicating consumption of certain food items.Protocols for performing systematic reviews in this field, as well as for assessing the validity of candidate BFIs havebeen developed within the Food Biomarker Alliance (FoodBAll) Project. This paper aims to evaluate the putativeBIFs for blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, blackcurrant, and grapes. Candidate BFIs forgrapes were resveratrol metabolites and tartaric acid. The metabolites considered as putative BFI for berriesconsumption were mostly anthocyanins derivatives together with several metabolites of ellagitannins and somearoma compounds. However, identification of BFIs for single berry types encountered more difficulties. In theabsence of highly specific metabolites reported to date, we suggested some multi-metabolite panels that may befurther investigated as putative biomarkers for some berry fruits.Keywords: Grape, Raisin, Strawberry, Blueberry, Blackberry, Cranberry, Raspberry, Blackcurrant, Biomarkers, IntakeIntroductionFruits are important components of a healthy diet [1].Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables is rec-ommended in dietary guidelines worldwide, and the in-take of fruits like berries, which are rich in nutrients,vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, may play a rolein disease prevention [116]. In terms of productionworldwide, according to FAOSTAT (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/# consulted on 28.02.2020), strawberries werethe most intensively produced berry, dominated byChina, USA, Mexico, and Turkey with production inkilotonnes (Kt): 2955.4 Kt, 1296.3 Kt, 653.6 Kt, and 440.9Kt, respectively. Cranberries were the second in theranking with USA and Canada producing 404.9 Kt and195.2 Kt, respectively. Production of raspberries wasdominated by Russia, Mexico, Serbia, and Poland with165.8 Kt, 130.2 Kt, 127.0 Kt, and 115.6 Kt, respectively.The top three producers of grapes worldwide in 2018were China, Italy and USA with the following kilotonnes:13,397.0 Kt, 8513.6 Kt, and 6890.9 Kt. According to theEuropean food consumption database, northern coun-tries, especially Finland and Latvia but also Spain andRomani are the biggest consumers of berries withinEurope, consuming 1.38 kg/year, 1.24 kg/year, 1.28 kg/year, and 1.17 kg/year. The strawberries (4.77 g/day) are© The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you giveappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate ifchanges were made.

Berry fruits are popularly consumednot only in fresh and frozen forms but also as processedand derived products, including dried and canned fruits,yogurts, beverages, jams, and jellies, making the evalu-ation of their intake rather delicate when using question-naires. On the other hand, grapes, excluding wine, aremainly consumed as fresh fruits, and mean consumptionin European countries, according to comprehensiveEuropean food consumption database, is 4.93 g/day [42].Among them, Hungary and Romania consume the high-est amount of grapes 9.7 g/day and 8.8 g/day, respect-ively [42, 180].Berry fruits have attracted considerable attention due totheir potential benefits to human health. Botanical classifi-cation defines berry as a fruit with seeds produced fromthe ovary of a single flower. According to this definitioncategory, berries include blueberries, cranberries, lingon-berries, Ribes species, grapes, but also bananas, tomatoesor eggplants. On the other hand, strawberries, raspberries,and blackberries are not botanical berries, however enterthis category in common nomenclature. This review in-cludes both botanical and commonly called berries: straw-berries (Fragaria × ananassa), raspberries (Rubus idaeus)and blackberries (Rubus fruticosus, other Rubus spp.),blueberries (Vaccinium fruits, i.e, V. myrtillus or V. corym-bosum), American cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon),and blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum). They provide high levelsof antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fibres and areamongst the richest sources of phenolic compounds inthe human diet [10, 43, 120]. The biological activities ofberries have been mainly attributed to their high contentof a diverse range of flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavonols,and flavanols), tannins (proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins,and gallotannins), phenolic acids (hydroxybenzoic andhydroxycinnamic acid derivatives), and lignans. In particu-lar, cranberries are known for their effect on urinary tractinfections, while blueberries (a proanthocyanidin-richfruit) and strawberries (an ellagitannin-rich fruit) are ac-tively studied for their impact on neuronal function andbehavior [8, 152, 154, 159].Grape also contains a wide variety of polyphenolswith demonstrated cardioprotective properties. Theirpolyphenolic content is higher than in other fruits, inthe range of 50–490 mg/100 g of fresh matter [18].However, an important percentage of these are con-tained in the seeds [102]. Several studies have beenfocused on the polyphenolic composition of this foodrevealing its complexity, mainly consisting ofproanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, stilbenes, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids and complex condensationstructures [21, 170]. It has been demonstrated thatpolyphenolic compounds from red grapes could im-prove endothelial function in patients with coronaryheart disease [93], age-related cognitive and motorfunction [90], or decreases in oxidative stress and in-flammatory markers [24, 118]. Considering both thehealth benefits of grape consumption [180] and themetabolic fate of their components, it became inter-esting to be able to monitor its intake with an accur-ate measurement tool.This work aimed to provide an overview of the me-tabolites found in biological fluids that could poten-tially act as BFIs for grape and different berry types,further evaluating their validity considering thecurrent available information and identifying the as-pects that require further investigation. There are sev-eral examples where a single metabolite could be abiomarker of a particular food intake, such as phlore-tin for apple intake [166]. However, the compositionof each plant food is very complex (from the quanti-tative and qualitative point of view) and many of thecompounds are widely distributed among a variety offoods [62]. Several polyphenols can be consideredsemi-ubiquitary, they are present in a wide range ofplant foods, e.g. chlorogenic acids (in coffee and appleand other fruits) or flavan-3-ols (in cocoa, tea fruit,and wine), and thus, using a single-biomarker strategyis very often not appropriate. On the other hand, theintake of different foods may give rise to similar me-tabolites in biofluids losing their specificity for a cer-tain dietary source [57]. The ellagitannins andprocyanidins represent such cases. Ellagitannins arepresent in foods such as walnuts, strawberries, Rubus,and pomegranate and are largely metabolized by themicrobiota, producing urolithin derivatives. Finally,urolithins indicate the intake of a food containingellagitannins, but are not specific for any food. Simi-larly, procyanidins, metabolized by the gut microbiotaproduce a wide range of valerolactones and valericacids, which have been proposed as biomarkers ofprocyanidin-rich foods—tea, cocoa, apple, walnuts, orwine. Considering those examples, the usefulness ofthese polyphenol metabolites as single biomarkers fordietary intake appears limited. For this reason, amulti-metabolite biomarker panel (MBP) was recentlyproposed as a tool to capture dietary exposure andimprove the accuracy and precision of dietary assess-ment [62]. This concept has been successfully appliedin a number of studies relating the urine metaboliteprofile to the intake of walnuts [59], cocoa [60], andbread [61]. The results from the aforementioned stud-ies showed that MBP performs better than uniquecompounds in terms of predicting dietary exposure.The present review thus considered single metabolitesacting as BFI, as well as the possibility of using mul-tiple metabolite panels for assessing the intake of ber-ries and grape.Ulaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 2 of 35This review has been performed in the frame of theFoodBAll project (Food Biomarkers Alliance, http://www.foodmetabolome.org/) funded by the Joint Pro-gramming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life”(JPI-HDHL).MethodsSelection of food groupsFor this review, grapes (Vitis vinifera) together with rai-sins (i.e., dried grapes) were selected as widely consumedmembers of the Vitaceae family. The second family offruits included in this work was botanical berries: blue-berries, cranberries, blackcurrant and redcurrant, andcommonly called berries: strawberries and Rubus fruits(raspberries and blackberries). The selection of berrytypes was based on the frequency of consumption re-ported in the FoodEx database [42] and in the literature[110]. The chokeberries and goji berries, as consumedless frequently, were not included in this review.Search for relevant FIB research papersAn extensive literature search was carried out to collectall available information on the existing and new candi-date BFIs for the selected fruits. The FIBRev protocol(Food Intake Biomarker Reviews) elaborated with guid-ance of the PRISMA statement (Preferred ReportingItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) anddescribed in Pratico et al. [128] was followed. Briefly, aprimary search was performed in the three databasesScopus, PubMed central, and Web of Science to identifycompounds that are already used as or may representpotential BFIs. Search for each berry type was performedindependently. The name of the specific fruit and its bo-tanical genus, i.e (strawberr* OR fragaria), (blackberr*OR rubus), (raspberr* OR rubus), (redcurrant OR ribes),(blackcurrant OR ribes), (blueberr* OR vaccinium),(cranberr* OR vaccinium), and (grape* OR rasin*) alongwith the common keywords: AND (urine or plasma orserum or excretion or blood) AND (human* OR menOR women OR patient* OR volunteer* OR participant*)AND (biomarker* OR marker* OR metabolite* OR bio-kinetics OR biotransformation OR pharmacokinetics ORbioavailability OR ADME) AND (Intake OR meal ORdiet OR ingestion OR administration OR consumptionOR eating OR drink*) were applied. Keywords were usedin the fields [Topic], [All fields], and [Article Title/Ab-stract/Keywords] for Web of Science, PubMed, and Sco-pus, respectively. All searches were carried out in March2016 and updated in December 2019. Only papers inEnglish language were considered eligible, and no re-striction on the date of publication was applied. Articlesshowing results of human intervention studies (random-ized controlled trials, acute, short-term or long-termstudies) or observational studies (cohort, case-control,cross-sectional studies) were considered eligible. A firstselection of papers was performed according to abstractand title relevance. Full texts were obtained for the se-lected articles and further assessed for eligibility accord-ing to their relevance in determining BFIs for grapes andberry fruits. Some of the publications found in the refer-ence list of the selected articles were also included atthis stage. The main exclusion criteria were papers thatdiscussed the health effects and in-vitro studies. The re-search papers identifying or using potential biomarkersof intake were selected according to the process outlinedin Fig. 1.Identification and characterization of candidate BFIsA secondary search allowed to retrieve relevant informa-tion to assess the quality of every individual candidatebiomarker, regarding specificity, biokinetics, dose–re-sponse relationship, robustness, and reliability of themethod of analysis, in order to validate its use as BFI ac-cording to the scoring validating scheme established byDragsted et al. [40].The name of the candidate biomarkers and their syno-nyms were queried in the previously mentioned data-bases along with AND (biomarker* OR marker* ORmetabolite* OR biokinetics OR biotransformation ORpharmacokinetics OR bioavailability OR ADME). Add-itionally, the compounds were searched manually in theonline databases HMDB (https://www.hmdb.ca), FooDB(http://foodb.ca/), Phenol-Explorer (http://phenol-ex-plorer.eu/), Dictionary of Food Compounds (http://dfc.chemnetbase.com/faces/chemical/ChemicalSearch.xhtml), Duke’s phytochemical and ethnobotanical data-bases (https://phytochem.nal.usda.gov/phytochem/search), eBASIS (http://ebasis.eurofir.org/Default.asp),Knapsack (http://kanaya.naist.jp/knapsack_jsp/top.html),and PhytoHub (http://phytohub.eu) to determine all thepossible dietary or metabolic origins of the candidateBFIs.Specific and non-specific metabolites were discussedin the text, while only the most plausible candidateBFIs have been reported in Table 1 including the in-formation related to study designs and analyticalmethods. The non-retained compounds are listed inTable 2, with main reasons for exclusion and refer-ences for an exhaustive presentation of the results.The tables have been reviewed and agreed upon byall authors.Application of validation criteriaAccording to Dragsted et al. [40], a set of criteria wasapplied on the candidate BFIs reported in Table 1, to as-sess their current status of validation and identify themissing information for a full validation of each of them.Ulaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 3 of 35ResultsBerry biomarkersFrom 852 citations, 75 human studies were selected forthis review (Fig. 1), most of them employing a targetedanalysis, while only 7 used an untargeted approach [2, 5,7, 31, 64, 94, 95]. Targeted analyses have mainly quanti-fied anthocyanins in their native glycosidic or aglyconeforms, as well as ellagitannins and their microbial me-tabolites. Some investigations also included quantifica-tion of phenolic acids and their conjugates.After careful application of the inclusion and exclusioncriteria to the citations collected with the databasessearch, the numbers of human studies selected for thisreview were 22 studies out of 206 for blueberry intake[2, 3, 12, 13, 32, 34, 37, 50, 81–83, 91, 103, 105, 106,112, 137, 153, 160, 178, 185]; 20 out of 137 for straw-berries [4, 5, 9, 14, 20, 22, 26, 31, 41, 48, 74, 75, 113,126, 129, 141, 147, 148, 165, 179], 7 out of 87 for rasp-berry [70, 78, 86, 95, 98, 156, 184], 5 out of 66 for black-berries [47, 64, 89, 100, 161], 13 out of 236 forcranberries [7, 27, 49, 51, 94, 108, 119, 127, 135, 174–176, 183], and 8 out of 61 for blackcurrant [44, 76, 80,105, 114, 115, 139, 164]. No publication on redcurrantcould be found relevant for this review.Grape biomarkersFrom the 880 unique citations screened, 32 original pa-pers fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review (Fig. 1)[6, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 33, 55, 66, 69, 71, 79, 84, 85, 96,97, 99, 107, 117, 118, 121, 122, 131, 138, 142, 143, 149,150, 157, 158, 168, 171, 177]. The grape extract was in-cluded in this review, considering that elimination ofwater fraction during desiccation does not drasticallychange the overall polyphenol content. Most of thesestudies were nutritional intervention studies with grapejuice or grape extract and used a targeted approach toanalyze specific metabolites associated with their intakein urine and/or plasma samples. Only few studies usedan untargeted metabolomics approach to obtain a holis-tic view of the metabolites associated with grape intake.DiscussionBerriesBerries, both botanical and aggregate, share several poly-phenol families and indeed most of the investigations re-ported in this review focused on anthocyanins,procyanidins, and other small phenolic metabolites asthe main compounds recovered in biological fluids afterberry intake.

Only four studies included sulfate and glucu-ronide conjugates of cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, andpetunidin in the analysis [5, 47, 81, 98]Ellagitannins were the second family of interest foundin the literature related to non-botanical berry consump-tion.

A reason for considering uro-lithins as putative BFIs for berries is the presence of ella-gitanins (from several hundreds of mg/kg to > 1 g/kg) instrawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, with a limitednumber of other food sources which could interfere.We examined the relevance of these compounds andothers as putative BFIs for every type of berry.BlueberriesEight studies investigated anthocyanin bioavailabilityafter consumption of blueberries in different forms:frozen blueberries, fresh bluberries, blueberry extract,blanched and unblanched blueberries, blueberry juice,and freeze dried berries [37, 81, 82, 103, 105, 112,178, 185]. The major anthocyanins in blueberries areglycosides of delphinidin and malvidin (SupplementaryTable 1). In most studies, the anthocyanin profile inplasma or urine matched the composition of theingested blueberry. Three malvidin glycosides werethe dominant urine anthocyanins in the study byMcGhie et al. [105]. Mazza et al. [103] and Del Boet al. [36] reported malvidin-3-galactoside andmalvidin-3-glucoside as the most concentrated metab-olites in serum, followed by delphinidin-3-glucosideand petunidin-3-glucoside, this pattern perfectlyreflecting the composition of the blueberry extractused in the study. Zhong et al. [185] found delphini-din glucuronide and dephinidin glucoside followed bymalvidin glucoside and petunidin glucoside as majormetabolites in urine. Unexpectedly, Kalt et al. [81–83]found pelargonidin glucuronide being dominant withdelphinidin glucuronide in 24-h urine. As the blue-berry juice used was devoid of pelargonidin aglyconeor glycosides, the authors suggested that the presenceof pelargonidin metabolites may be explained by aninterconversion between anthocyanins. Although thedetection of anthocyanins may indicate the consump-tion of certain berries, their low concentrations aswell as their chemical instability appear to drasticallylimit their use as quantitative BFIs, and most likelyalso qualitative use.Not only were anthocyanins found in biological fluids,but also a number of phenolic compounds, some ofthem being anthocyanin microbial metabolites [3, 12, 32,50, 53, 112, 134, 136, 137, 153, 160]. In the study by Feli-ciano et al. [50], a total of 61 phenolic metabolites werequantified in plasma at baseline, of which 43 increasedafter acute or 1-month supplementation with blueberrydrinks. Benzoic and catechol derivatives representedmore than 80% of the changes in the phenolic profileafter 2 h consumption on day 1, whereas hippuric andbenzoic derivatives were the main compounds that in-creased at 0 and 2 h, respectively on day 30. All of thesemetabolites, however, are common for a wide range offruits and vegetables, and therefore cannot be consideredas specific biomarkers of blueberry consumption.Two studies used an untargeted approach aiming atexploring the metabolome changes after blueberry intake[2, 91]. Ancillotti et al. reported a high number ofplasma and urine metabolites that were statistically sig-nificant after consumption of a single 25-g dose of Vac-cinum myrtillus. The authors applied a robust analysisof MS/MS patterns for a reliable identification. However,they did not find metabolites specific enough for blue-berry to serve as candidate BFI. Among the most dis-criminant metabolites were benzoic, ferulic, andphenylpropionic acid derivatives, as well as phenyl-valeric acid and phenyl-valerolactone derivatives.Table 2 List of non-retained compounds for grapes/raisins and berries (Continued)Food item Compound Biofluid Reasons for exclusion Referencesacid, 4-hydroxyhippuric acid, catechol sulfate*Cinnamic acids and its derivatives:dimethoxy cinnamic acid sulfate*,ferulic acid, ferulic acid sulfate*caffeic acid sulfate*Urine, plasma Unspecific, common formany fruits and vegetables[80, 164]Phenylacetic acid and itsderivatives:dihydroxy phenylacetic acid sulfate*Urine Unspecific, common formany fruits and vegetables[164]Quercetin Plasma Unspecific, common formany fruits and vegetables[44]Vitamin C Plasma Unspecific [80]uric acid Plasma Unspecific, endogenouscompound[80]* Metabolites found using untargeted metabolomicsUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 21 of 35Additionally, two anthocyanins, delphinidin hexosideand cyanidin hexoside, were detected in urine. Langeret al. similarly attempted to identify blueberry-derivedmetabolites in plasma and urine metabolomes 2 h afterintake of fresh blueberries or juice. However, compoundidentifications were only putative, without acquisition ofMS-MS spectra, and mostly non-specific phenolic acidswere reported.Based on the available studies, it is hard to proposeany candidate BFI for blueberry. The presence of malvi-din and its phase II metabolites in urine, together withother anthocyanins, may indicate blueberry intake. How-ever, they are obviously not specific and robust enoughto constitute a BFI. Another limitation is the very lowconcentration of these metabolites in biological fluids,frequently below the limit of detection. Further studiesshould definitely be undertaken in humans, consideringother components than anthocyanins in blueberries. Ap-plication of untargeted metabolomics with a reliable androbust annotation process, may bring new insights onunforeseen markers of blueberry intake. In particular,the increasing availability of chemical standards, the en-richment of spectral libraries and new bioinformaticstools allowing accurate prediction of metabolism, andMS fragmentation will help in the future to improve theannotation of discriminating compounds, and possiblyreveal unforeseen candidate BFIs for blueberry.CranberriesCranberry is reported to have health benefits, includingprevention of urinary tract infections, due to its high con-tent in phytochemicals, including proanthocyadinins A andother polyphenols [54, 88, 125]. Although these health ben-efits have been recognized, a very limited number of studieshave investigated the circulation of cranberry-derived me-tabolites in humans [7, 27, 49, 94, 108, 119, 175]. Amongthe publications included in this review, some focused onthe analysis of structurally related anthocyanin metabolites[27, 108, 119], which are present in very low amounts inplasma in comparison to their phenolic acid metabolites,while others quantified small phenolic acids after cranberryintake [49, 51, 135, 174, 175, 183]. Interestingly, two studiesused an untargeted approach to investigate changes inplasma and urine metabolome after consumption ofcranberry juice [7, 94].Four studies have focused on targeted analysis ofanthocyanins and flavonols [27, 108, 119, 175]. Sevenanthocyanins were found in plasma at low nanomole perlitre levels after consumption of a single dose of 480 mLof cranberry juice, namely peonidin-3-O-galactoside >cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside > cyanidin-3-O-galctoside >peonidin-3-O-arabinoside > cyanidin-3-O-glucoside >peonidin-3-O-glucoside > malvidin-3-O-glucoside [108].The pattern of anthocyanin glucosides observed in urinewas similar to that in plasma, with the exception ofmalvidin-3-O-glucoside, and generally reflected the rela-tive concentrations present in the juice or the cranberryextract beverage [27, 108, 119].One study aimed at verifying whether proanthocyanindimer A-2 could be a valid biomarker of cranberry in-take. A progressive, weekly dosing schedule protocol wasapplied, involving 5 healthy females drinking for 7 weeksa cranberry juice at increasing frequencies [174]. Whileproanthocyanin dimer A-2 was quantifiable in urine, itdid not appear to be excreted in a concentration thatcorresponded to the dosing schedule and intake of cran-berry juice. Additionally, proanthocyanin dimer A-2 wasnot detected in all spot and 24-h urine samples of thethree subjects. These data suggest that proanthocyanindimer A-2 cannot be considered as a good candidate in-take biomarker. Liu et al. [94] studied metabolomechanges in plasma after cranberry juice intake, comparedwith apple juice intake, assuming that different types ofprocyanidins (A-type vs B-type, respectively) from thetwo juices can differently impact the human metabo-lome. Through the untargeted assay, several endogenousand exogenous metabolites were found to discriminatethe two interventions. Among the metabolites differenti-ating cranberry intake from apple intake were quinicacid, catechol sulfate, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol sul-fate, coumaric acid sulfate, ferulic acid sulfate, citramalicacid, hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, hippuric acid, 2-hydroxyhippuric acid, and vanilloylglycine (Table 2).Although among the annotated metabolites, none seemspecific to cranberry, several discriminant featuresremained unidentified. Further efforts for more extensiveand reliable annotation are required, to ensure full struc-ture elucidation of all highly discriminant metabolites.Baron et al. [7] used a mixed untargeted and targetedapproach to analyze urine samples from a randomized,double-blind, 2-arm repeated measure cross-over studywith cranberry extract. Again, only non-specific smallphenolics and valerolactones conjugated to sulfate andglucuronide moieties were identified among the discri-mimant features (Table 2).A wide range of different classes of phenolic acids andtheir sulfate and glucuronide conjugates have beenquantified in plasma and urine after cranberry intake[49, 51, 127, 135, 175, 183]. Rodriguez-Mateos et al.[135] investigated the absorption, metabolism, and ex-cretion of cranberry polyphenols in the plasma and urineof healthy young men after the consumption of 450 mLof cranberry juice, providing an increasing dose of totalpolyphenols: 409 mg, 787 mg, 1238mg, 1534mg, and1910 mg. In plasma, hippuric acid and catechol-O-sulfatewere found at the highest concentrations, followed by 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, and others(see Table 2). The metabolite profile found in urine wasUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 22 of 35very similar, with hippuric acid representing 64% of theexcreted metabolites, while 14% were phenylacetic acids,followed by benzoic acids (9%), catechols (5%), valerolac-tones (4%), and cinnamic acids (3%). Total plasma, butnot urinary excreted (poly)phenol metabolites, exhibiteda linear dose response, driven by caffeic acid 4-O-ß-D-glucuronide, ferulic acid derivatives, and benzoic acidderivatives (see Table 2).Recently, terpenes have gained considerable attention,being found at significant concentrations in cranberries[87]. Ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid, was found asthe dominant terpene in American cranberries (46–109mg/100 g FW), together with two other rare derivatives ofursolic acid: cis-3-O-p-hydroxycinnamoyl ursolic acid(12–16mg/100 g FW) and trans-3-O-p-hydroxycinnamoylursolic acid (42–60mg/100 g FW) [87]. Monotropein, 6,7-dihydromonotropein, and other iridoid derivatives havealso been described in cranberry [16]. More effort shouldbe put on performance of the untargeted experiments,which have the potential to reveal new BFIs.BlackcurrantBlackcurrant phytochemicals have been found to offera variety of beneficial effects, including immunomodu-latory, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory actionsand inhibition of low-density lipoprotein, while thehigh vitamin C content of blackcurrant (18–103 mg/gfresh weight) can help to achieve the recommendeddaily intake [56, 73, 77, 80, 109, 124, 130]. However,little is known about the recovery of blackcurrant me-tabolites in biofluids and no attempt to identify BFIhas been made so far. Only a few studies have inves-tigated the bioavailability of blackcurrant anthocya-nins, which is of little relevance for identifyingcandidate BFIs. Two anthocyanins, namelydelphinidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-rutinosidewere reported in urine samples collected 2–4 h post-prandially ([76, 115]; and [80]. Only one study re-ported anthocyanins in plasma Nakamura et al. [114]quantified the following compounds in decreasingorder of concentration: delphinidin-3-rutinoside > cya-nidin-3-rutinoside > delphinidin-3-glucoside > cyanidin-3-glucoside, which was consistent with the respectivequantities of the ingested anthocyanins (see Table 1for details). Blackurrants have an interesting aromaprofile with monoterpenoids being particularly highsuch as 3-carene, sabinene, humulene, α pinene, andterpinolene [17, 39, 52] (see Supplementary Table 1).However, there are no investigations yet on the me-tabolism of aroma blackcurrant in humans. There isthus a critical need for data related to the impact ofblackcurrant on the human metabolome, and foridentification of blackcurrant metabolites that couldact as potential biomarkers of intake.StrawberriesOf the twenty investigations included for this review forstrawberry, most used a targeted metabolomics approachto detect the low concentrations of anthocyanins in bio-logical fluids, with the exception of one study [31],where an untargeted approach was used. As regardsstrawberry composition, pelargonidin-based anthocya-nins and procyanidins are particularly high (see Supple-mentary Table 1) but not specific to strawberry, whilefuraneol and mesifurane are characteristic aroma com-pounds of strawberry.Several studies reported pelargonidin metabolites in theurine metabolic profile after strawberry intake [4, 20, 22,113, 126]. Mullen et al. identified four pelargonidin glucu-ronide isomers, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargo-nidin aglycone in plasma and urine, while pelargonidinsulfate was detected only in urine. Similar profiles werefound in urine by Carkeet et al. [22], Azzini et al. [4], Parket al. [126], Felgines et al. [48], Hollands et al. [75], and[20]. Three investigations considered dose–response ef-fects [22, 48, 75] and reported that urinary excretion ofpelargonidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin glucuronideisomers increased linearly with the dose of strawberry.However, the total urinary excretion of strawberry antho-cyanin metabolites remained low corresponding to only0.9–1.80% of the pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested.The profiles of pelargonidin metabolites in plasma weresimilar to those in urine [5, 41, 113, 179]. Banaszewski et al.[5] characterized the postprandial plasma profile of straw-berry anthocyanins, particularly pelargonidin-based anthocy-anins, across 4 doses using targeted and untargeted analysis.Pelargonidin-O-glucuronide was found to be the primarypelargonidin metabolite and showed a dose–response rela-tionship. However, while the maximum concentration inplasma and the area under the concentration–time curveincreased with the dose, the concentrations decreased as thepercentage of the dose, suggesting a possible saturation ofthe absorptive mechanisms or an increased efficiency inelimination. Apart from the glucuronide conjugate,qualitative Q-TOF LC/MS analysis revealed 33 other phen-olic compounds, including a wide range of pelargonidinmetabolites, such as pelargonidin sulfate, pelargonidin-3-O-6′′-rhamnosylglucoside, carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-O-glucopyranoside, pelargonidin-3-(6′′-caffeoylglucoside),pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3-sambubioside,and pelargonidin-3-(6′′-malonylglucoside). Similarly,Edirisinghe et al. [41], who analyzed plasma using targetedLC-MS/MS, detected pelargonidin sulfate, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, and pelargonidin-3-O-glucuronide to be themost abundant metabolites following intake of a singleportion of strawberries. Quantification of pelargonidin sul-fate, pelargonidin glucoside and pelargonidin glucuronideshowed concentrations in the low nanomole per litre range,with Tmax varying between 1.1 and 2 h [41, 113, 147].Ulaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 23 of 35Urolithins have been the subject of investigations byseveral authors [9, 14, 25, 26, 129, 148, 165], and theirappearance in biological fluids was studied after straw-berry intake in chronic and acute modes. In an acutestudy [25], the microbial metabolite urolithin B glucuro-nide was first detected along the urine fractions from 32to 56 h. Considerable inter-individual differences, prob-ably associated with differences in colonic microbiotacomposition, were noted, identifying “high- and low-metabolite excreters”. Later, Truchado et al. [165] foundurolithins in urine profiles after fresh strawberry intake,with urolithin A glucuronide as the predominant metab-olite, followed by urolithin A, urolithin B, and urolithinB glucuronide. All urolithins appeared in urine within atime ranging from 8 to 32 h. Urolithin B and urolithin Bglucuronide were detected in only 4 volunteers (20% ofthe total population), consistently with the reported factthat only part of the population synthesizes urolithin B;actually, only part of the population has the microbiotaspecies that are able to realize all metabolic steps re-quired to convert ellagitannins/ellagic acid into urolithinB. The mean urinary excretion of urolithin conjugatesover 92 h reached 58 ± 48% of the amount of total ellagicacid administered (62 mg) after fresh strawberries and57 ± 52% after strawberry puree. On the other hand, nourolithin A was found in plasma after several days ofstrawberry consumption in two studies [14, 129], andonly trace amounts of ellagic acid (15.2 ± 5.2 ng/mL)were detected by Basu et al. [9]. Urolithins present sev-eral limitations as candidate BFIs. Walnuts and otherfruits contain ellagitannins; thus, the specificity forstrawberry is quite low, although strawberries are a veryrich source of both simple and complex ellagitannins[67], and among the fruit containing ellagitannins, straw-berries are the most widely consumed. Their main ellagi-tannin, agrimoniin, has been suggested to be one of themost widely present ellagitannins in the human diet dueto strawberry intake [172], while casuarictin is the sec-ond characteristic strawberry ellagitannin [67]. The in-terindividual variation in urolithin production by themicrobiota is also likely to affect their accuracy as quan-titative BFIs. However, the interest of total urolithins ascomponents of a multi-marker BFI for strawberries de-serve further investigation, especially in observationalsetting.Three studies suggested the importance of strawberryaroma compounds in the search for candidate BFIs. Oneuntargeted experiment was performed by Cuparencuet al. [31], in which three furaneol and mesifurane me-tabolites were found in urine, namely furaneol glucuro-nide, furaneol sulfate, and mesifurane sulfate. Thisrandomized controlled crossover meal study was de-signed to study urine kinetics after a single intake of150 g of strawberry puree. Furaneol metabolites hadalready been the subject of investigation in 1997 byRoscher et al. [141], who reported furaneol glucuronideto be the main strawberry aroma metabolite in urine. In2010, Henning et al. [74] quantified furaneol glucuronideusing LC-MS/MS in both plasma and urine of 21 volun-teers receiving 250 g of strawberries for 3 weeks. Plasmaconcentrations at 6 h were 148.9 ± 223.8 nM, while in 0–12-h urine, 14.5 μmol/g creatinine were detected. Al-though fairly specific for strawberry, aroma metaboliteshave still not gained much attention as intake bio-markers. Furaneol was also found in pineapples, rasp-berries, or kiwi fruits; moreover, it is a product ofMaillard reactions [151], which indicate cooking pro-cesses such as baking or frying. Therefore furaneol de-rivatives alone can hardly be proposed as BFI forstrawberry intake.In terms of biomarker validation criteria, pelargonidinand its conjugates, as well as utolithins achieve plausibil-ity criterion, however fail at specificity. Aroma metabo-lites seem to be plausible and specific; however, there isa lack of information related to the concentration in bio-logical fluids. Definitely more studies are required tounderstand ADME processes of aroma compounds inhumans. To summarize, based on current knowledge,only a multi-metabolite biomarker panel could be sug-gested to indicate strawberry intake (see Fig. 2 withFig. 2 Overview of the validation process and its application on candidate BFIs for grapeUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 24 of 35validation scheme). Pelargonidin glucuronide togetherwith urolithins and furaneol/mesifuran derivatives seemthe most appropriate candidates; however, differences inexcretion rates requires an intensive work to identify themost applicable biofluid and time for sample collection.RaspberriesRaspberries have a phytochemical profile also rich inellagitannins and anthocyanins, with sanguiin H-6 andlambertianin C, as well as cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside,cyanidin-3-O-(2-O-glucosyl)rutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, being the most characteristic compounds.The specific aroma of raspberries is mainly due to thepresence of 4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, commonlycalled raspberry ketone.There are no human studies considering the metabol-ism of raspberry aroma compounds, although such com-pounds seem to be very specific. The metabolism ofraspberry ketones has been investigated in animals only:rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits [156]. Raspberry ketonewas rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract afteradministration of a single dose of 1 mmol/kg (164 mg/kgbw) by oral gavage. The majority of ingested raspberryketone was excreted in urine within the first 24 h as itsphase II conjugated metabolites (glucuronide and sulfateforms). In addition to raspberry ketone phase II metabo-lites, a total of 14 other compounds were detected inurine. Of these, the reduction product 4-(4-hydroxyphe-nyl)butan-2-ol was the most abundant, followed by 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol,4-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one, and 4-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)butan-2,3-diol. Total urinary recovery was closeto 90% for the three animal species. Considering thatraspberry ketone is specific to the raspberry and seemsto be well absorbed, more effort is obviously required inthe future to determine and characterize the metabolitesof this particular aroma compound in human biologicalfluids. However, raspberry ketone is increasingly used asa food additive due to its pleasant flavour. Thus, its de-tection would have to be accompanied by other rasp-berry metabolites to reflect berry intake and notconsumption of aromatized foods.Metabolites of raspberry ellagitannins and anthocya-nins have been the focus of investigations by severalgroups [70, 78, 98, 184]. In the study by Ludwig et al.[98], a total of 27 metabolites were detected in urine forover a 48-h collection period after a single intake of 300g of raspberry, and 15 metabolites were found in plasmafor over a 24-h collection period. Cumulative urine me-tabolite profile was dominated by derivatives of phenyl-propanoic acid, urolithins, and ellagic acid, while mainlyurolithins and ellagic acid derivatives were detected inplasma. The profiles of urolithin metabolites in bothmatrices were very similar, with urolithin A-sulfate asthe dominant metabolite, followed by urolithin A-O-glu-curonide, urolithin B-3-O-glucuronide, (iso)urolithin A-sulfate-O-glucuronide, isourolithin A-O-glucuronide,dimethylellagic acid-O-glucuronide, characterized byTmax between 8 and 24 h and concentrations ranging be-tween 3.5 and 450 nmol/L. The presence of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in urine and plasma after raspberry intakewas found at low nanomoles per litre levels by the threeauthors (González-Barrio et al. [70], Ludwig et al. [98],and Istas et al. [78]), confirming that native anthocyaninsoccur only at low trace amounts in biological fluids.The other metabolites reported in urine and plasmaafter raspberry intake included mainly small phenolicacids belonging to benzoic, phenyl acetic, and hippuricacid derivatives, as well as ferulic and caffeic acid deriva-tives, ascorbic acid, and methylepicatechin sulfate. Allthese metabolites, however, occur frequently in urine afterdifferent nutritional interventions with plant foods, there-fore cannot be considered as candidate BFIs for raspberryeven as part of a multi-marker [78, 95, 98, 184].There is a considerable need for more human studiesfocusing on raspberry intake. It might be speculated thatraspberry ketone metabolites together with total uro-lithin metabolites in urine samples could be consideredas potential candidates of indicative markers, or act asmulti-metabolite biomarker panel; however, the topic re-mains widely open.BlackberriesIn the case of blackberries, investigations included in thisreview also mostly considered metabolites of anthocyaninsand ellagitanins. Three studies were single-dose experi-ments involving healthy volunteers [47, 64, 100], and in allof them, a metabolomics approach targeted on cyanidinsand urolithins was applied for plasma and urine profiling.Cyanidin metabolites were found in biological fluidsby Felgines et al. [47], García-Muñoz et al. [64, 65], andMarques et al. [100]. In Marques’ study, methyl cyanidinglucuronide and 3’methyl-cyanidin-3-glucoside were themain anthocyanin conjugates detected in both plasmaand urine samples. Apart from these metabolites, otherminor compounds were detected: cyanidin glucuronide,cyanidin glucoside sulfate, methyl cyanidin glucoside,cyanidin-3-glucoside-7-glucuronide, cyanidin rutinoside,and cyanidin-3-glucoside. For the metabolites mentionedabove, Tmax varied between 66 and 120 min, with Cmaxconcentrations between 11 and 272 ng/mL. An investiga-tion by Felgines et al. [47] and Tian et al. [161] con-firmed the presence of cyanidin monoglucuronide andthe low urinary excretion of native cyanidins such ascyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidingsambubioside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside.García-Muñoz et al. [64, 65] studied ellagitannin me-tabolism in urine after the ingestion of 250 mLUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 25 of 35blackberry juice. It is known that the composition inellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives is very similarfor blackberry and raspberry, as for all Rubus fruits [68].The primary ellagitannin derivatives found in humanurine were urolithin A glucuronide and urolithin B glu-curonide, followed by urolithin C glucuronide, urolithinD glucuronide, urolithins A, B, C, D, M5, methylurolithin A, ellagic acid, ellagic acid dimethyl ether glu-curonide, ellagic acid dimethyl ether, and hexahydroxy-diphenyl. However, the urolithin metabolite profilesvaried considerably between volunteers, as already re-ported for other dietary sources of ellagitannins, as wellas by Kresty et al. [89], who reported that urolithin Aglucuronide and urolithin A-sulfate were detected in85% and 60% of patients, respectively, following 12 and26 weeks of lyophilized blackberry consumption. Thefact that individuals do not respond in the same wayafter the ingestion of the same food complicates the in-terpretation of a measured value in terms of dose–re-sponse relationships.Again, more studies in humans are required in orderto identify the most specific metabolites for blackberryand better describe their kinetics in plasma and urine.Based on the aforementioned studies, it is difficult tospeculate about which metabolites may be potential bio-markers of blackberry intake, while combination of uro-lithin metabolites in 24-h urine with cyanidinmetabolites could only be a rough indicative marker forblackberry consumption, for the reasons already dis-cussed for the other berries.Given the high similarity of their qualitative compos-ition, the Rubus berries could be evaluated as a com-bined group. A distinctive feature of the ellagitannins inthe Rubus fruit is that they contain the sanguisorboylgroup, a relatively uncommon ester between a galloylgroup and a (S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl moiety, which ispositional isomeric as compared with the more wide-spread valoneoyl ester group. This building block ispresent at a concentration close to 50% that of the el-lagic acid [173]. Unfortunately, we are currently lackingdata about the fate of this structure upon ingestion.Berries considered as one food typeAs showed above for various berry types, it is not easy topropose candidate BFIs. In most cases, berry-derivedmetabolites failed the specificity criterion. On the otherhand, berries could be considered as a food group, and apanel of metabolites could indicate the consumption ofberries without specification of the berry species. In suchcase, urolithins and anthocyanin metabolites, when presentsimultaneously in biological fluids, appear as the most rele-vant candidates. However, several strong limitations exist.One is the high individual variation in the production ofurolithins, described with the three metabotypes A, B, and0 [63, 162, 163]. A way to overcome this issue would be towisely sum the concentrations of the major urolithins re-ported in the different metabotypes: urolithin A, urolithinB, urolithin C, and urolithin D, together with their glucuro-nide and sulfate conjugates [163]. Urolithins are producedby the opening and decarboxylation of one of the lactonerings of ellagic acid and the sequential removal of hydroxylgroups. The decarboxylation step leads first to formation ofurolithin M-5, and from this urolithin D, urolithin M-6through dehydroxylation at different positions. Furtherdihydroxylation lead to formation of three hydroxy-urolithins: urolithin C, urolithin M-7, and two hydroxy-urolithins: urolithin A and isourolithin A. Finally the mono-hydroxy urolithins are urolithin B and isourolithin B [45]. Anumber of studies investigating metabolism of ellagitanninsreported urolithin A and B glucuronide and sulfate, as themain metabolites in urine and plasma, while urolithin Cand isourolithin A glucuronide were minor metabolites [28,65, 72, 92, 140, 165]. Considering anthocyanins, the follow-ing metabolites were the most frequently found in urineafter different berry consumption: cyanidin glycosides,cyanidin glucuronide, malvidin glycosides, malvidin glucu-ronide, pelargonidin glycosides, and pelargonidin glucuro-nide. Delphinidin glycosides and glucuronide together withpetunidin metabolites could be considered as minor me-tabolites. An appropriate collection of samples for bothanthocyanins and urolithins should be carefully evaluatedand may be difficult to implement, as these compoundshave markedly different pharmacokinetics. Urolithins ap-pear in plasma and urine for only several hours (5 h andmore) after an ellagitannin-containing meal, and are stilldetectable around 12–36 h [30], while anthocyanins havea Tmax of 1–2 h [30]. Then intensive investigations are re-quired to verify whether such multi-metabolite panelcould accurately indicate consumption of berries in largepopulations. Another important issue to consider is thepresence of confounding factors such as consumption ofother foods rich in ellagitanins and anthocyanins. Specialattention should be put on nut intake, as these are a well-known source of ellagitannins [58]. Regarding anthocyaninintake, among vegetables and fruits, red radish, red cab-bage, black beans, eggplants, grapes, pomegranate, andcherries represent likely confounding factors [104].GrapesAmong the studies selected for this review, only a fewapplied an untargeted metabolomics approach to obtaina holistic view of the metabolites associated with theintake of grape or grape extracts [66, 85, 168]. Garcia-Perez et al. aimed to identify BFI and proposed a pipe-line method using grape as an example. The method wasbased on the combination of an untargeted discoveryapproach in an acute study followed by a hypothesis-driven targeted analysis in a short-term dietaryUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 26 of 35intervention. Using NMR, the authors first identified tar-taric acid as the most discriminating metabolite in urineafter red grape intake, while in a second step a targetedapproach was used for quantification of this acid in anindependent dietary intervention (Table 1). In the dis-covery study, the authors observed that other NMR sig-nals from glucose, hippurate, and 4-hydroxyhippuratewere also associated with grape intake; however, onlytartaric acid increased proportionally in all participantswith incremental grape intake over the duration of thestudy. Then they confirmed with a targeted analysis thattartaric acid excretion was elevated in 24-h urine sam-ples after 4 days of consumption of grapes, reaching alevel accounting for 19% of the dose ingested fromgrapes. The relationship was dose-dependent as afterconsumption of 50, 100, and 150 g of grapes, an averageamount of 0.16, 0.30, and 0.49 mmol of tartaric acid, re-spectively, was excreted in 24-h urine [66]. This observa-tion complemented the results previously published byLord et al. [97] which showed an increase in urinary tar-trate excretion from 7.4 to 282 μg/mg of creatinine afteran acute intake of 280 mL (10 oz) of grape juice and byStalmach et al. [158] who reported excretion of 59±14 μmol over 24 h after intake of 350 mL of Concordgrape. Some pharmacokinetics data are available for tar-taric acid, showing that its excretion peaks between 4and 8 h after grape intake, with a majority of the excre-tion occurring in the first 12 h [66].Two other studies applied an untargeted metabolomicsapproach providing information on the changes occur-ring in 24-h urine fingerprints after an intervention withgrape extracts for 2 or 4 weeks. In the first study on 58subjects [168], authors showed differences in 18 metabo-lites detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrom-etry (GC-MS), corresponding to metabolites derivedfrom host and gut microbiota metabolism of grapephenolic acids (Table 2). The other study was developedon 31 subjects after an acute or a 15-day supplementa-tion with a drink containing grape skin extract [85]. Theauthors pointed out that the postprandial urinary metab-olome determined by LC-MS after a single dose wascharacterized by phase II metabolites of polyphenolspresent in grape skin, whereas in 24-h urine samples col-lected after a prolonged consumption, phase II metabo-lites derived from microbial metabolism of flavanolswere predominating (Table 2). However, the identifiedmetabolites do not have a high specificity for grape con-sumption, since they were also detected in urine afterconsumption of other polyphenol-rich sources, such ascocoa, tea, red wine, or almond [144].In term of validation of tartaric acid as BFI, the plausi-bility criterion seems fulfilled, as tartaric acid was de-scribed as the main organic acid in red and green grapes[66], as well as in wine [133]. Tartaric acid biosynthesisbegins with L-ascorbic acid through the cleavage of asix-carbon intermediate between position C4/C5. This isthe predominate pathway in the Vitaceae plants [35,146]. On the other hand, it can be present in some proc-essed foods, such as mixed dishes (0.42 g/kg), biscuits(0.12–0.13 g/kg) or chocolate (0.00–0.18 g/kg), where itis added as an acidifying agent. However, concentrationsreported in these dietary sources were markedly lowerthan in grapes (6–9 g/kg) and wine [11, 155]. Actually,tartaric acid has also been reported in urine after wineintake [132, 169]. Consequently, tartaric acid could beconsidered as a candidate biomarker, not just for grapesbut also for all grape-derived products including wine.The analytical performance, as well as chemical stabilitywere proved in both targeted and untargeted experi-ments. Dose–response experiments confirm this valid-ation criterion, while time–response for multiple dosesand robustness in observational studies still have to beevaluated; see Fig. 2.Beside tartaric acid, resveratrol metabolites can beconsidered as relevant candidate BFI for grape. Resvera-trol is a natural stilbene mainly present in grapes and itsderivatives including juices and wine. Being mainly ex-tracted from the skins, where it is present both in thefree forms (cis and trans) and as their 3-glucosides(piceid) [101], resveratrol presence is higher in wholegrapes and in red wines than in white wines and juices.Rotches-Ribalta et al. [143] provided a comprehensiveoverview of the resveratrol metabolic profile. The metab-olism of resveratrol in humans involves the formation ofglucuronides and sulfate conjugates, as well as conju-gates of dihydroresveratrol (DHR), which is a metabolitederived from the hydrogenation of resveratrol by the ac-tion of the gut microbiota. Four studies showed in-creased levels of resveratrol and its derived metabolitesafter grape juice or grape extract consumption, mainlythrough acute studies [107, 121, 142, 143] (Table 1).Meng et al. [107] were not able to detect resveratrol inhydrolysed urine samples after the intake of 200 and400 mL of grape juice, but its level was increased afterdoses of 600 and 1200mL, which suggests a dose–re-sponse relationship. Some of these studies providedpharmacokinetics data for resveratrol after grape intake.In one of them, after consumption of 1 L of grape juice,plasma concentrations of cis- and trans-resveratrolreached maximal levels (36.5 ng/mL in hydrolysed sam-ples, 0.16 μM) 4 h after grape juice. Then their levelsgradually decreased throughout the next 12 h and wereno longer detectable in some subjects after 24 h [121].Rotches-Ribalta et al. [142] also observed in non-hydrolysed samples that although resveratrol glucosides(piceid) can be detected in plasma as intact forms, theyreached maximum concentrations (4.5 ng/mL) 1 h afteran intake of grape extract tablets, whereas after about 4Ulaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 27 of 35h, much higher plasma concentrations (14.83–35.23 ng/mL) were observed for resveratrol glucuronides and after7–8 h, even higher concentrations for DHR glucuronides(23.06–85.70 ng/mL). Plasma levels of resveratrol glucu-ronides showed two maximum peaks (at 4 h and 8 h),suggesting an enterohepatic recycling [142]. Whereasonly glucuronide conjugates were found in plasma sam-ples; in urine samples, both glucuronide and sulfate con-jugates were detected [142, 143]. In parallel with theplasma results, the highest excretions of DHR metabo-lites were achieved later than resveratrol phase II metab-olites and up to 24 h after the intake of grape extract[142, 143]. On the other hand, Ortuño et al. [121] ob-served that the urinary excretion of resveratrol isomersincreased after the consumption of grape juice, reachinga peak at 0–4 h with a recovery of 14.2 ± 5.9% of thedose (0.6 ± 0.3 μmol). Surprisingly, the microbial metab-olite DHR was not detected in urine after grape intake,although in the same study, an increase of its urinary ex-cretion was observed after wine consumption. It is im-portant to keep in mind that a high variability in theamounts of resveratrol excreted in urine was observedwithin subjects, and this variability was even more im-portant for microbial metabolites [142, 143]. In addition,the proportion of the various resveratrol metabolitesmay depend on the dose, with a higher proportion ofsulfates compared to glucuronides when the ingesteddose increases [142]. These aspects must be consideredwhen formulating a quantitative threshold from whichwe could confirm that a person has ingested grape ornot.As regard to BFI validation (Fig. 2), the first plausibilitycriterion for resveratrol is fulfilled, as wines and grapesare the major dietary sources [181], although it is alsopresent in other foods, such as apple, peanuts, pista-chios, or berries. According to Farneti et al. [46], applescan be a possible source of dietary intake of resveratrol;however, resveratrol or its metabolites were not foundso far in biological fluids after apple intake. Regardingthe analytical performance for determining resveratrolmetabolites in biological samples, Urpi-Sarda et al. [167]reported that resveratrol and its metabolites were stablein urine samples from subjects who consumed red wineunder different storage and sample handling conditions,after freeze and thaw cycles and short- and long-term (5years) storages. In parallel, quantification methods ofthese metabolites in biofluids showed good analyticalvalidation parameters (ie., analytical variability, accuracy,sensitivity, specificity, precision, limits of detection, andquantification) [121, 142]. In summary, the use of thesum of resveratrol metabolites as BFI of grape might besuitable because of the significant increase after grapeconsumption, the specificity for this food and a knownkinetics during the 24-h following the ingestion.However, it would be highly recommended to developfurther studies to evaluate more in depth the dose–re-sponse relationship and the inter-individual variation, es-pecially for microbial metabolites. This will help todefine a specific cutoff value or calibration curve to de-termine consumption levels, as it has been proposed forwine [182]. As the concentrations of resveratrol metabo-lites are rather low even after high doses, the minimumintake level measurable will have to be determined.Except for tartaric acid and resveratrol, no otherpromising candidate BFI were retained for grapes. Manyother studies with a targeted approach focused on thenon-specific major polyphenols of grape, namely antho-cyanins [15, 55, 157], catechins, and procyanidins [99,149, 150, 157]. Other non-specific small phenolics, in-cluding a range of hydroxybenzoic acids (gallic acid,dihydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, hydroxyhippuricacid, etc.), pyrogallol metabolites, hydroxyphenylaceticacids, or hydroxyphenylpropanoic acids [158, 177] whichare either present in the grape or originate from gut-microbiota metabolism have been reported in biofluidsafter grape intake. The list of these non-specific metabo-lites is reported in Table 2.Among anthocyanidins, cyanidin, delphinidin, malvi-din, peonidin, petunidin [19, 55, 157], and their glucuro-nide conjugates [157] were identified in urine, plasmaand/or ileal fluid after an acute intake of red grape juice(Table 2). However, anthocyanins are quite unstablecompounds, and low bioavailability rates were found inall studies, with maximum detected levels found in thefirst hour after the intake of the test product and a veryrapid elimination. Additionally, these metabolites havebeen reported after the intake of other anthocyanin-richfoods, such as berries [15, 19, 55, 157]. All of these as-pects obviously limit the usefulness of the anthocyanin-metabolites as biomarkers of grape intake, see Table 2.Increased levels of a wide range of flavan-3-ols metab-olites have also been observed (Table 2). Vinson et al.[171] and Lutz et al. [99] reported increased levels ofepicatechin and catechin, determined in hydrolysedplasma and urine samples after intake of red grape seedextract and grape juice, respectively. Other reported me-tabolites are phase II conjugated forms of monomericflavan-3-ols [157], as well as microbial-derived metabo-lites [158]. Sano et al. [149] detected procyanidin B1 inits intact form at low levels (nmol range) in humanserum 2 h after intake of grape seed extract. However, aspreviously pointed out, these metabolites do not haveenough specificity when evaluated individually since theycan also increase after the intake of other flavan-3-olfood sources.Another group of metabolites widely reported in thereviewed studies is that related to gallic acid. Some authorsreported an increased excretion of this hydroxybenzoic acidUlaszewska et al. Genes & Nutrition           (2020) 15:17 Page 28 of 35[79, 99, 157] or its metabolites methyl-gallic acid [131, 177]and pyrogallol [131, 158, 168] after grape consumption.Gallic acid can originate from the food itself or from thedegradation of precursor compounds, in particular fromthe cleavage of galloylated monomeric flavan-3-ols by mi-crobial catabolism (Monagas et al. [111]). Therefore, even ifgallic acid metabolites are probably systematically presentin biofluids after grape intake, they do not appear as valu-able candidate BFIs for grape, if used alone, due to themajor confounding of tea for example. Increased levels ofquercetin and related-metabolites have also been reportedin different studies after grape intake [24, 29, 33, 107], butthese metabolites also increase after the intake of onionsand tea, among other foods [144].In light of these results, we can conclude that bothtartaric acid and the sum of resveratrol metabolites,understood as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, ap-pear as the best candidate BFIs available for grapes.However, they could also reflect wine consumption.In this regard, Vázquez-Fresno et al. [169] proposedto use the combination of tartaric acid and ethyl glu-curonide to monitor wine consumption. Therefore,this “tartrate-ethyl glucuronide” model could be im-plemented to differentiate grape intake from wineconsumption.ConclusionThe results yielded by the bibliographic survey ongrape show the complexity lying on finding a uniquebiomarker of grape intake. Although many metabo-lites are strongly related to the consumption of thisfruit, their variable presence in the matrix, their insuf-ficient specificity and low bioavailability after the in-gestion can limit their usefulness as a reliablebiomarker of intake. Here, we suggest that the metab-olites that could overcome these limitations are tar-taric acid and the sum of resveratrol metabolites,associated with the non-detection of ethyl glucuronideor another alcohol biomarker as a confirmation thatthe detection of tartaric acid and resveratrol metabo-lites is due to a consumption of grapes as fruit andnot as wine.With regards to berries, considering the metabolitesfound in biological fluids and reported in this review, nometabolite can be suggested as a specific BFI for anyparticular berry. Berries share some phytochemicals suchas anthocyanins and ellagitannins with other fruits ornuts, and therefore, such metabolites fail the specificitycriterion—the first to be verified across the BFI valid-ation system.Regarding single berry types, a multi-metabolite bio-marker panel could be proposed, to evaluate whethera combination of more than one metabolite has a suf-ficient predictive capacity. In such a way, urolithinsderived from ellagic acid and ellagitannins, especiallyimportant for strawberry (and Rubus) fruits, togetherwith pelargonidin metabolites and specific aromacompounds such as furaneol/ mesifurane conjugatedto sulfate or glucuronides moieties could be associ-ated with strawberry intake. Correspondingly, uro-lithins together with raspberry ketone metabolitescould be associated with raspberry intake. The humanmetabolism of aroma compounds, especially furaneol,mesofurane for strawberries, or raspberry ketones forraspberries require more investigations regardingdose–response relationship, quantification levels, andpossible interindividual variability. Profiling of volatilefood compounds is gaining more and more interest,not only in field of food quality and food safety, andcould be of relevance for the discovery of novel spe-cific BFIs for berries. A tentative proposal of multi-metabolite panels reflecting specific berry intake isshown in Fig. 3. It is clear that all of them requireadditional analysis and validation before they can beconsidered applicable BFIs for berries.Of the 104 studies reported in this review, onlyseven applied an untargeted metabolomics approach,and fewer had the objective to identify specific BFIsfor berries. Despite the fact that considerable progresshas been made in the understanding of the metabol-ism of berry phytochemicals in humans, there are stillimportant gaps in our knowledge on the ADME inhumans of components other than anthocyanins andellagitannins. In particular, aroma compounds defin-itely require further attention. Untargeted metabolo-mics in controlled intervention studies will be anapproach of choice for making progress in this field,provided that important efforts are devoted to identifythe discriminating metabolites. Metabolite identifica-tion remains the bottleneck of biomarker discoverystudies applying metabolomics. A profound knowledgeof the detailed composition of foods and food prod-ucts is absolutely required to find a link between me-tabolites circulating in biological fluids and the foodconstituents from which they derive. Furthermore, theuse of bioinformatics tools BioTransformer (http://biotransformer.ca/) [38], Meteor Nexus (Lhasa Lim-ited, UK), or ADMET Predictor (Simulation Plus,Lancaster, CA, USA) for in silico prediction of metab-olism and for supporting the interpretation of analyt-ical data can greatly facilitate that arduous step ofmetabolite identification.Finally, as it becomes more and more evident thanspecific simple biomarkers will not be found for everytype of food, complex modelization systems will have tobe developed to allow the correct interpretation of com-binations of multimetabolites biomarkers, taking into ac-count the possible intake of confounders.Ulaszewska et al.
