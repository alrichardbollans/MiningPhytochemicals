Structures and stereochemistry of 1–4 were fully elucidated and characterized by 2D NMR anal-ysis. Alstiphyllanines E and F (1 and 2) showed moderate Na+-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1 and SGLT2)inhibitory activity. A series of a hydroxy substituted derivatives 21–28 at C-17 of the picraline-type alka-loids have been derived as having potent SGLT inhibitory activity. 10-Methoxy-N(1)-methylburnamine-17-O-veratrate (6) exhibited potent inhibitory activity, suggesting that the presence of an ester side chainat C-17 may be important to show SGLT inhibitory activity. Structure activity relationship of alstiphylla-nines on inhibitory activity of SGLT was discussed. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionNa+-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) is a membrane protein thatplays an important role in the re-absorption of glucose in the kid-neys. SGLT is known to have three isoforms (SGLT1, SGLT2, andSGLT3).1–3 SGLT1 is expressed primarily in the brush border mem-brane of mature enterocytes in the small intestine, where it ab-sorbs dietary glucose and galactose from the gut lumen.4 SGLT2is only expressed in the renal cortex, where it is assumed to bepresent in the brush border membrane of the S1 and S2 segmentsof the proximal tubule, and to be responsible for the re-absorptionof glucose from the glomerular filtrate.4 It is expected that the inhi-bition of SGLT could decrease glucose re-absorption and that thiscould thus result in an increase in urinary sugar excretion, and adecrease in blood glucose level. Thus, SGLT inhibitors have thera-peutic potential for type 2 diabetes.5Our screening study on SGLT inhibitors in traditional medicine6discovered that the methanol extract of Alstonia macrophylla showsmoderate SGLT inhibitory activity. The genus Alstonia, which iswidely distributed in tropical regions of Africa and Asia, are well-known rich sources of unique monoterpene indole alkaloids withvarious biological activities such as anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, and antimalarial properties.7 Recently,several new indole alkaloids were isolated from extracts of AlstoniaNHNOCO2MeOOMeOMeOHNHNOCO2MeOOMeOMeOHMeOMeO NNOCO2MeHMeOHO3211 23456789101112131415161718192021221'2'3'4'5' 6'23NNCO2MeHOHHO1 235678910111213141516171819202140968-0896/$ - see front matter  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion2.1. Structures of alstiphyllanines E–H (1–4)Leaves of A. macrophylla were extracted with MeOH, and the ex-tract was partitioned between EtOAc and 3% aqueous tartaric acid.Water-soluble materials, adjusted to pH 9 with satd aq Na2CO3,were extracted with CHCl3. The CHCl3-soluble materials were sub-jected to an LH-20 column (CHCl3/MeOH, 1:1) followed by a silicagel column (CHCl3/MeOH, 1:0–0:1). The eluted fractions were fur-ther separated by ODS HPLC (MeOH/H2O/TFA) to afford 1 (1.8 mg,0.00050% dry weight), 2 (1.3 mg, 0.00036%), 3 (10.4 mg, 0.0029%),and 4 (3.6 mg, 0.0013%), together with 16 known alkaloids,burnamine-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate10 (5), 10-methoxy-N(1)-methylburnamine-17-O-veratrate10 (6), alstiphyllanine D9(7), alstiphyllanine B9 (8), alstiphyllanine C9 (9), picralinal11 (10),picrinine11 (11), quaternine12 (12), O-deacetylpicraline13 (13), vin-camedine14 (14), vincamajine15 (15), alstiphyllanine A9 (16),vincamajine-17-O-veratrate16 (17), vincamajine-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate16 (18), alstonal17 (19), and alstonerine14 (20).Alstiphyllanine E {1, ½a26D 93 (c 1.0, MeOH)} was revealed tohave the molecular formula C30H32N2O7, by HRESITOFMS [m/z533.2272 (M+H)+, D 1.6 mmu]. The 1H NMR data (Table 1)showed the presence of seven aromatic protons, an ethylidene sidechain, a methyl ester function, and two methoxy groups. TheHMBC cross-peak of H2-21 to C-19 indicated the ethylidene sidechain at C-20. The position of each methoxy group was confirmedby HMBC correlations of O-Me to C-30 and C-40. HMBC correlationsfor H-5 to C-2, H2-17 to C-7, and H2-6 to C-16 indicated alstiphylla-nine E possessed picraline-type skeleton. The molecular formulaeof alstiphyllanine E was smaller than that of burnamin-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate9 by CH2O unit. Compared with 1HNMR data of burnamin-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate,9 alsti-phyllanine E was suggested a picraline-type backbone without O-Me at C-50. The relative stereochemistry of 1 was elucidated byNOESY correlations as shown in computer-generated 3D drawing(Fig. 1). The NOESY correlation of H3-18 to H-15 indicated thatthe geometry of ethylidene side chain was E. The b-orientation ofC-17 was elucidated by the NOESY correlation of H-14b/H-17a.Alstiphyllanine F {2, ½a26D 32 (c 1.0, MeOH)} was revealed tohave the molecular formula C32H36N2O9, by HRESITOFMS [m/z593.2511 (M+H)+, D 1.2 mmu], which was larger than that ofburnamin-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate by CH2O unit. Com-pared with 1H NMR data of burnamin-17-O-30,40,50-trim-ethoxybenzoate, alstiphyllanine F was suggested a picraline-typebackbone with O-Me. The HMBC cross-peak of H3-O-Me (dH 3.27)to C-10 (dC 156.5) revealed the presence of an indole moiety witha methoxy group at C-10. HRESITOFMS data [m/z 413.2080(M+H)+, D 0.4 mmu] of alstiphyllanine G {3, ½a26D 42 (c 1.0,MeOH)} established the molecular formula, C23H28N2O5, whichwas larger than that of O-deacetylpicraline13 by C2H4O unit. TheNMR data of 3 were analogous to those of O-deacetylpicraline13 ex-cept for the following observation: a methoxy signal (dH 3.70) andan N-methyl signal (dH 2.89) lacking in O-deacetylpicraline ap-peared for 3. The presence of both methyl groups was verified bythe HMBC correlations of the methoxy protons to C-10 and theN-methyl protons to C-2 and C-13.Alstiphyllanine H {4, ½a26D 21 (c 1.0, MeOH)} was obtained as abrown amorphous solid and was revealed to have the molecularformula C22H26N2O4, by HRESITOFMS [m/z 383.1971 (M+H)+, D2.7 mmu], which was larger than that of vincamajine15 by anoxygen unit. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed the presence offour aromatic protons, an ethylidene side chain, a methyl esterfunction, and an N-methyl group.

Arai et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. 18 (2010) 2152–2158 2153C-5–C-6, C-2–C-15, and C-18–C-19 were deduced from a detailedanalysis of 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 4. The HMBC cross-peaks ofH3-18 to C-20 and H-19 to C-15 indicated the presence of an eth-ylidene side chain at C-20 (Fig. 2). And the presence of an indolinering was elucidated by HMBC correlations for H-9 to C-7 and N-Meto C-2 and C-13. HMBC correlations for H-2, H-5, and H-6a to C-17and H-6a and H-14a to C-16 indicated alstiphyllanine H possessedajmaline-type skeleton. Comparison of 13C chemical shifts of C-3,C-5, and C-21 (dC 70.5, 77.4, and 67.3, respectively) in 4 with those(dC 53.2, 61.7, and 55.6, respectively) of vincamedine14 indicatedthe presence of an N-oxide functionality at N-4. The relative stereo-chemistry of 4 was elucidated by NOESY correlations as shown incomputer-generated 3D drawing (Fig. 2). NOESY correlations ofH3-18 to H-21 indicated that the geometry of the ethylidene sidechain was Z. The NOESY correlations of H-3/H-2 and H-14a andH-14b/H-17 indicated that H-2 was a-orientated and H-17 wasb-oriented. Oxidation of vincamajine with m-chloroperoxybenzoicacid (m-CPBA) afforded the N-oxide derivative, whose spectral dataand the [a]D value were identical with those of natural alstiphylla-nine H. Thus, the structure of asltiphyllanine H was elucidated asshown in Figure 2.2.2. SGLT inhibitory activityThe in vitro SGLT inhibitory potential of alkaloids 1–20 was as-sessed by monitoring inhibition of uptaking of methyl-a-D-gluco-pyranoside in cultured cells expressing SGLT1 or SGLT2 at 50 lM(Table 3). As shown in Table 3, picraline-type alkaloids with vera-trate or trimethoxybenzoate at C-17 such as compounds 1, 2, and5–7, showed inhibitory activity against SGLT1 and SGLT2. How-ever, compounds 8 and 9 which have an N(4)-Me group were foundto have no SGLT inhibitory activity. Any ajmaline and macrolinetype alkaloids (4 and 14–20) did not show inhibition on SGLT1and SGLT2.To discuss SAR of picraline-type alkaloids showing SGLT inhib-itory activity, we prepared eight picraline-type derivatives 21–28from 6 and 7 by use of acyl anhydride, m-CPBA, and boron tribro-mide, respectively (Table 4). As shown in Table 4, the presence ofan N(1)-Me group promoted SGLT1 inhibitory activity when com-pared to those of 1, 2 and 5. Compound 22 which was converteda methoxy group at C-10 of 7 into a hydroxyl showed less activityagainst SGLT1, whereas N(4)-oxide derivatives 23 and 24 with aNHNOCO2MeOOMeOMeO1 23456789101112131415161718192021221'2'3'4'5' 6'231H-1H COSY HMBCFigure 1.

Ali-phatic esters at C-17 such as 26 and 27 showed less activity againstboth SGLT1 and SGLT2, and the presence of an aromatic long sidechain at C-17 such as cinnamoyl derivative 25 potentiated theinhibitory activity against SGLT1 and SGLT2. On the other hand,the benzyl ether derivative 28 at C-17 did not show inhibitoryactivity.In this work, three new picraline-type alkaloids, alstiphylla-nines E–G (1–3) and a new ajmaline-type alkaloid, alstiphyllanineH (4) were isolated from the leaves of A. macrophylla, and theirTable 3Structures and SGLT inhibitory activity of alkaloids 1–20R1 R2 R3 R4 Inhibition %aSGLT1 SGLT2Picraline-type alkaloids1 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 H H H 60.3 85.92 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe H H 65.2 103.83 CH2OH OMe Me H 14.0 31.65 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 H H H 19Z 53.0 87.36 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 OMe Me H 95.8 102.67 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe Me H 89.9 101.48 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 OMe Me H N(4)-Me -10.3 -0.29 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe Me H N(4)-Me -8.2 -6.110 CHO H H H 16.5 36.311 H H H H 9.6 27.312 H OMe H OMe 11.7 30.013 CH2OH H H H 10.1 -0.2Ajmaline-type alkaloids4 Me OH N(4)-oxide 4.3 23.114 Me OAc 22.0 47.415 Me OH 11.5 30.616 Me OAc N(4)-oxide 5.3 38.517 Me OBz(OMe)2 26.0 44.018 Me OBz(OMe)3 7.2 47.6Macroline-type alkaloids19 15.8 26.820 20.7 27.7 picraline type(1-3 and 5-13)NNOR1 CO2MeHR2R316104R419NNR2 CO2MeR1ajmaline type(4 and 14-18)HH N O91NH OHHHHOmacroline typeNN OHHHH02Omacroline typea Inhibition (%) at 50 lM.Table 4Structures and SGLT inhibitory activity of picraline-type derivatives 1, 2, 5–7, and 21–28R1 R2 R3 Inhibition %a (IC50 lM)SGLT1 SGLT21 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 H H 60.3 (44) 85.9 (40)2 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe H 65.2 (39) 103.8 (40)5 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 H H 19Z 53.0 (50) 87.3 (35)6 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 OMe Me 95.8 (4) 102.6 (0.5)7 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe Me 89.9 (5) 101.4 (2)21 CH2O-Bz OMe Me 85.2 (17) 100.1 (1)22 CH2O-Bz(OH)3 OH Me 46.9 (50) 95.6 (7)23 CH2O-Bz(OMe)2 OMe Me N(4)-oxide 94.6 (5) 64.9 (35)24 CH2O-Bz(OMe)3 OMe Me N(4)-oxide 93.8 (4) 91.4 (11)25 CH2O-cinnamoyl OMe Me 96.3 (5) 102.8 (1)26 CH2O-Ac OMe Me 5.4 (>100) 39.9 (78)27 CH2OCOCH2CH3 OMe Me 27.1 (97) 86.9 (12)28 CH2O-Bn OMe Me 7.6 (>100) 25.7 (>100)NNOR1 CO2MeHR2R316104 picraline type (1, 2, 5-7, and 21-28)a Inhibition (%) at 50 lM.H.

SAR study ofthese alkaloids and synthetic analogue against STLT1 and SGLT2suggested that the presence of picraline-type alkaloid with an esterside chain at C-17 may be important to show inhibitory activity.3. Experimental section3.1. General methods1H and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 spec-trometer and chemical shifts were reported using residual CD3OD(dH 3.31 and dC 49.0) as internal standards. Standard pulse se-quences were employed for the 2D NMR experiments. 1H–1H COSY,HOHAHA, and NOESY spectra were measured with spectral widthsof both dimensions of 4800 Hz, and 32 scans with two dummyscans were accumulated into 1 K data points for each of 256 t1increments. NOESY spectra in the phase sensitive mode were mea-sured with a mixing time of 800 ms. For HMQC spectra in the phasesensitive mode and HMBC spectra, a total of 256 increments of 1 Kdata points were collected. For HMBC spectra with Z-axis PFG, a50 ms delay time was used for long-range C–H coupling. Zero-fill-ing to 1 K for F1 and multiplication with squared cosine-bell win-dows shifted in both dimensions were performed prior to 2DFourier transformation.3.2. MaterialThe leaves of A. macrophylla were collected at Purwodadi Botan-ical Garden, Indonesia in 2006. The botanical identification wasmade by Ms. Sri Wuryanti, Purwodadi Botanical Garden, Indonesia.A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium at Pur-wodadi Botanical Garden, Pasuruan, Indonesia.3.3. Extraction and isolationThe leaves of A. macrophylla (363.5 g) were extracted with MeOH.The MeOH extract (43.8 g) was treated with 3% tartaric acid (pH 2)and then partitioned with EtOAc. The aqueous layer was treatedwith satd aq Na2CO3 aq to pH 9 and extracted with CHCl3 to givealkaloidal fraction (2.06 g). The alkaloidal fraction was purified byLH-20 column (CHCl3/MeOH, 1:0) and SiO2 column (CHCl3/MeOH,1:0?0:1) and the fraction eluted by MeOH was purified by ODSHPLC (CH3CN/H2O/CF3CO2H, 45:55:0.1; flow rate, 2 mL/min; UVdetection at 254 nm) to afford alstiphyllanines E (1, 1.8 mg,0.00050% yield), F (2, 1.3 mg, 0.00036%), G (3, 10.4 mg, 0.0029%),and H (4, 3.6 mg, 0.0013%), together with known alkaloids, burn-amine-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzoate10 (5), 10-methoxy-N(1)-methylburnamine-17-O-veratrate10 (6), alstiphyllanine D9 (7), alsti-phyllanine B9 (8), alstiphyllanine C9 (9), picralina11 (10), picrinine11(11), quaternine12 (12), O-deacetylpicraline13 (13), vincamedine14(14), vincamajine15 (15), alstiphyllanine A9 (16), vincamajine-17-O-veratrate16 (17), vincamajine-17-O-30,40,50-trimethoxybenzo-ate16 (18), alstonal17 (19), alstonerine14 (20).3.3.1.
