Parasites & Vectors 2014, 7:184http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/7/1/184RESEARCH Open AccessEvaluation of larvicidal activity of the essential oilof Allium macrostemon Bunge and its selectedmajor constituent compounds against Aedesalbopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)Xin Chao Liu1, Qiyong Liu2, Ligang Zhou3 and Zhi Long Liu1*AbstractBackground: During the screening programme for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and localwild plants, the essential oil of dried bulbs of Allium macrostemon Bunge (Liliaceae) was found to possess larvicidalactivity against mosquitoes. The aim of this research was to determine the larvicidal activity of the essential oil andits major constituent compounds against the larvae of the Culicidae mosquito, Aedes albopictus.Methods: Essential oil of A. macrostemon was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography(GC) and gas chromaotography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The activity of the essential oil and its two majorconstituents were evaluated, using World Health Organization (WHO) procedures, against the fourth instar larvae ofAe. albopictus for 24 h and larval mortalities were recorded at various essential oil/compound concentrationsranging from 9.0 - 150 μg/ml.Results: The essential oil of A. macrostemon exhibited larvicidal activity against the early fourth instar larvae ofAe. albopictus with an LC50 value of 72.86 μg/ml. The two constituent compounds, dimethyl trisulfide and methylpropyl disulfide possessed strong larvicidal activity against the early fourth instar larvae of Ae. albopictus with LC50values of 36.36 μg/ml and 86.16 μg/ml, respectively.Conclusion: The results indicated that the essential oil of A. macrostemon and its major constituents have goodpotential as a source for natural larvicides.Keywords: Allium macrostemon, Aedes albopictus, Larvicidal activity, Methyl propyl disulfide, Dimethyl trisulfideBackgroundFemales of many species of mosquitoes consume bloodfrom living vertebrates, including humans. They are animportant public health concern around the world. Inthe process of feeding on blood, some of them transmitextremely harmful human diseases, such as yellow fever,dengue fever, malaria, several forms of encephalitis, filaria-sis and chikungunya [1]. Millions of deaths occur globallyeach year due to mosquito-borne diseases with a dispro-portionate effect on children and elders in developingcountries [2]. Mosquitoes also cause allergic responses on* Correspondence: zhilongliu@cau.edu.cn1Department of Entomology, China Agricultural University, Haidian District,Beijing 100193, ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Commons Attribution License (http://creativecreproduction in any medium, provided the orDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.orunless otherwise stated.humans that include local skin and systemic reactionssuch as angioedema [3]. The yellow fever mosquito (Aedesaegypti L.) and the Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictusSkuse) are the two main species of mosquito responsiblefor dengue fever and malaria in China [4]. Mosquitolarvae and pupae are currently controlled by the usageof synthetic chemical insecticides organophosphates(e.g. temephos, fenthion, malathion), and insect growthregulators (e.g. diflubenzuron, methoprene). Their re-peated use has disrupted the natural biological controlsystems, sometimes resulting in the widespread develop-ment of resistance as well as undesirable effects on non-target organisms, toxic residues in food, workers’ safety,This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creativeommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andiginal work is properly credited.

Parasites & Vectors 2014, 7:184 Page 2 of 5http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/7/1/184and high cost of procurement [5]. These problems havewarranted the need for developing alternative strategiesusing ecofriendly products. From this point of view,botanical pesticides, including essential oils, are promisingsince they are effective, environmentally friendly, easilybiodegradable and often inexpensive. Moreover, herbalsources provide a lead for discovering new insecticides [5].It is suggested that many essential oils and constituentcompounds derived from various essential oils can exerttoxic activity against mosquito species [6-11]. During ourmass screening program for new agrochemicals from wildplants and Chinese medicinal herbs, essential oil of driedbulbs of Allium macrostemon Bunge (Family: Liliaceae)was found to possess larvicidal activity against the Asiantiger mosquito, Ae. albopictus.The dried bulbs of A. macrostemon are well known asthe traditional Chinese medicine “Xie Bai”, which is usedfor the treatment of thoracic pain, stenocardia, heartasthma and diarrhea [12]. The bulbs and leaves, eaten aspart of the diet, are emmenagogue, nervine and tonic.When added to the diet on a regular basis, they help toreduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the di-gestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[12]. In the previous reports, various furostanol sapo-nins, steroidal saponins and spirostane saponins havebeen isolated and identified from the plant [13-26].Chemical composition of essential oil of A. macrostemonhas been analyzed previously [27-29]. Juice of this plantis used as a moth repellent [13]. However, a literaturesurvey has shown that there is no report on insecticidalactivity of the essential oil of A. macrostemon and itsconstituent compounds against mosquitoes, thus we de-cided to investigate the larvicidal activity of the essentialoil of A. macrostemon and its major constituents againstthe Asian tiger mosquito.MethodsPlant materialAir-dried bulbs of wild A. macrostemon (5 Kg, collectedduring August, 2012, from Baicheng city, Jilin Province,44.57°N latitude and 121.50° E longitude) were pur-chased from the Anguo Medicinal Herb Market, Hebei071200, China. The plant sample was identified by Dr LiuQR (College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University,Beijing 100875, China) and a voucher specimen (CMH-XieBai-Liaoning-2012-06) was deposited at the Departmentof Entomology, China Agricultural University, Beijing,China. The sample was ground to powder using a grindingmill (Retsch Muhle, Haan, Germany) and was subjected tohydrodistillation using a modified Clevenger-type appar-atus for 6 h and extracted with n-hexane. Anhydrous so-dium sulphate was used to remove water after extraction.Essential oils were stored in airtight containers in arefrigerator at 4°C for subsequent experiments.Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS)Profiles of volatile constituents were determined usingan Agilent 5973 GC-MS system operating in the EImode at 70 eV [equipped with a 30 m HP-5MS column(0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) and coated with 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane using a HP-5MS (df = 0.25 μm)(Agilent J&W Scientific, USA)]. The temperature pro-gram used for the analysis was as follows: initialtemperature at 60°C, held for 1 min, ramped at 4°C/minto 290°C and held for 0.5 min. Helium was the carrier gasat 1.0 ml/min; the sample (1 μl 1/100, v/v, in acetone) wasinjected in the split mode (1:10). The injector and detectortemperatures were preformed at 230°C and 300°C, re-spectively. Most constituents were identified by gas chro-matography by comparison of their retention indices withthose of the literature or with those of authentic com-pounds available in our laboratories. The retention indiceswere determined in relation to a homologous series ofn-alkanes (C8-C24) under the same operating conditions.Further identification was made by comparison of theirmass spectra with those stored in NIST 05 and Wiley 275libraries or with mass spectra from literature [30]. Com-ponent relative percentages were calculated based onnormalization method without using correction factors.Insect cultures and rearing conditionsMosquito eggs of Ae. albopictus utilized in bioassayswere obtained from a laboratory colony maintained inthe Department of Vector Biology and Control, Institutefor Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, ChineseCenter for Disease Control and Prevention. The dehy-drated eggs were put into plastic trays containing tapwater to hatch and yeast pellets served as food for theemerging larvae. The egg batches, collected daily, werekept wet for 24 h and then placed in mineral water inthe laboratory at 26-28°C under natural summer photo-period for hatching. The newly emerged larvae werethen isolated in groups of ten specimens in 100 ml tubeswith mineral water and a small amount of dog food.Larvae were controlled daily until they reached the fourthinstar, when they were utilized for bioassays (within 12 h).BioassaysRange-finding studies were run to determine the appro-priate testing concentrations. Concentrations of 150.0, 75.0,37.5, 18.5, and 9.0 μg/ml of the crude extract/compoundwere tested. The larval mortality bioassays were carried outaccording to the test method of larval susceptibility assuggested by the World Health Organization [31]. Twentylarvae were placed in glass beaker with 250 ml of aqueoussuspension of test material at various concentrations andan emulsifier (DMSO) was added in the final test solution(less than 0.05%). Five replicates were run simultaneouslyper concentration and with each experiment, a set ofTable 1 Chemical constituents of the essential oil ofAllium macrostemonPeak no.

The two con-stituents, dimethyl trisulfide (98%) and methyl propyl di-sulfide (97%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc.(Shanghai, China). For comparison, commercial chlorpyri-fos [purchased from National Center of Pesticide Stan-dards (8 Shenliao West Road, Tiexi District, Shenyang110021, China)] was used as a positive control. The tox-icity of chlorpyrifos was determined at 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6,and 0.3 μg/ml. The assays were placed in a growth cham-ber (L16:D9, 26-27°C, 78-80% relative humidity). Mortalitywas recorded after 24 h of exposure and the larvae werestarved within this period. The percentage of mortalitywas corrected for control mortality using Abbott’s for-mula. Results from all replicates for the pure compounds/oil were subjected to probit analysis using the PriProbitProgram V1.6.3 to determine LC50 values and their 95%confidence intervals [32].Results and discussionEssential oil chemical compositionThe yield of yellow essential oil of A. macrostemon was0.56% (v/w based on dry weight) while its density was0.92 g/ml. A total of 16 components from the essentialoil of A. macrostemon were identified, accounting for98.27% of the total oil. The principal constituents ofA. macrostemon essential oil were methyl propyl disul-fide (47.2%) and dimethyl trisulfide (37.2%) followed bydiallyl thiosulfinate (3.3%) and 1,3-dithiane (2.6%) (Table 1).Monoterpenoids only represented 3 of the 16 compounds,corresponding to only 0.29% of the whole oil, while 13 ofthe 16 constituents were S-containing compounds (97.98%of the crude essential oil). A large variation in the chemicalprofiles of the A. macrostemon essential oil in this studywas observed from those of previous reports [27-29]. Forexample, dimethyl trisulfide (21.0%), methyl propyl trisul-fide (18.6%), methyl propyl disulfide (17.0%) and isopropylpropyl disulfide (10.6%) were the major compounds in theessential oil of A. macrostemon harvested from Shenyang,Liaoning province, China [27]. However, the essential oil ofA. macrostemon collected from Jilin province, Chinamainly contained dimethyl trisulfide (29.98%), methyl allyltrisulfide (29.01%), methyl allyl disulfide (6.87%), and me-thyl propyl trisulfide (5.74%) [28], while the essential oil ofA. macrostemon obtained from Sichuan province, Chinacontained methyl allyl trisulfide (20.73%), dimethyl trisul-fide (16.01%), dimethyl tetrasulfide (9.25%), and dimethyldisulfide (5.62%) [29]. The results above suggest that thereare great variations in chemical composition of essential oilof A. macrostemon. This variation could be due to analyticmethods, population, different parts used, harvest time andlocal, climatic and seasonal factors as well as storageduration of medicinal herb. Thus, further studies on plantcultivation and essential oil standardization are needed.Larvicidal activityThe essential oil of A. macrostemon exhibited larvicidalactivity against the early fourth instar larvae of Ae. albo-pictus with an LC50 value of 72.86 μg/ml (Table 2). Thetwo constituent compounds, dimethyl trisulfide and me-thyl propyl disulfide possessed strong larvicidal activityagainst the early fourth instar larvae of Ae. albopictus withLC50 values of 36.36 μg/ml and 86.16 μg/ml, respectivelyLiu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2014, 7:184 Page 4 of 5http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/7/1/184(Table 2). The commercial insecticide, chlorpyrifos showedlarvicidal activity against the mosquitoes with a LC50 valueof 1.86 μg/ml, thus the essential oil of A. macrostemon was39 times less toxic to Ae. albopictus larvae compared withchlorpyrifos. However, compared with the other essentialoils/extracts in the literature, essential oil of A. macroste-mon exhibited stronger or the same level of larvicidalactivity against Ae. albopictus larvae, e.g. essential oils ofEucalyptus urophylla (LC50 = 95.5 μg/ml) [34]; essentialoils of Achillea millefolium (LC50 = 211.3 μg/ml), Helichry-sum italicum (LC50 = 178.1 μg/ml), Foeniculum vulgare(LC50 = 142.9 μg/ml) [35]; ethanol extract from Crypto-meria japonica (LC50 = 93.8 μg/ml) [36], and ethanolextract of Knema attenuata (LC50 = 141 ppm) [37] as wellas a solution of 80% ethanol extract of fresh garlic (Alliumsativum) [38]. Among the two constituent compounds,methyl propyl disulfide exhibited almost the samelevel of larvicidal activity as the essential oil and di-methyl trisulfide possessed stronger larvicidal activitythan the crude oil against Ae. albopictus larvae. More-over, compared with chlorpyrifos, dimethyl trisulfideexhibited 19 times less toxicity against Ae. albopictuslarvae (Table 2).In the previous reports, the two constituents exhibitedantimicrobial activities against several bacteria and fungias well as nematodes [39-42]. There are numerousreports on insecticidal activity of sulfide-containingcompounds against pests including the two constituentcompounds. For example, dimethyl trisulfide was dem-onstrated to exhibit toxicity to African cowpea bruchid(Bruchidius atrolineatus) [43]. Dimethyl trisulfide andmethyl propyl disulfide also exhibited larvicidal activityagainst the yellow fever mosquito (Ae. aegypti) [44,45].The above findings suggest that the essential oil and thetwo major constituent compounds show the potential tobe developed as possible natural larvicides for thecontrol of mosquitoes.It seems that this plant is quite safe for human con-sumption because it has been used as a common vegetableor spice in Chinese food [46] and also as a medicinal herbfor the treatment of thoracic pain, stenocardia, heartasthma and diarrhea [12]. Dimethyl trisulfide and methylpropyl disulfide can be used as food additives and flavoursin China. However, no information on toxicity of theessential oil and the isolated constituents to humansare available. Thus, to develop a practical applicationfor the essential oil and its constituents as novel in-secticides, further research into the safety of the essentialoil/compounds to humans is needed. Additional studieson the development of formulations are also necessary toimprove the efficacy and stability and to reduce costs.Moreover, field evaluation and further investigations onthe effects of the essential oil and its constituent com-pounds on non-target organisms are necessary.ConclusionsThe essential oil of Allium macrostemon bulbs and itstwo major constituents demonstrate strong larvicidalactivity against Aedes albopictus mosquito larva. Ourresults suggested that the essential oil of A. macrostemonand the two major constituents may be recommendedeffectively in mosquito control program but needs to befurther evaluated for safety in humans and to enhancetheir activity.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsZLL designed the work and supervised the manuscript.
