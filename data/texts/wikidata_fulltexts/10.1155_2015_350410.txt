Chromatographic separation of a methanol extract prepared from the whole plant ofDendrobium brymerianum led to the isolation
of eight phenolic compounds. Among the isolated compounds (1–8),moscatilin (1), gigantol (3), lusianthridin (4), and dendroflorin
(6) showed appreciable cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cell lines with IC
50
values of 196.7, 23.4, 65.0, and 125.8 𝜇g/mL,
respectively, and exhibited antimigratory property at nontoxic concentrations. This study is the first report on the biological
activities of this plant.
1. Introduction
High incidence of cancer metastasis in lung cancer makes
this type of cancer among the most severe in the world [1].
Although the patients who receive appropriate treatments
have approximately 15-16% of 5-year survival, the relapse
of the disease cannot be ignored [2]. Metastasis of cancer
cells involves the ability of the cells to migrate away from
their origin. The cells migrate and invade through the
basementmembrane and enter the blood circulation. At their
appropriate secondary sites, the cells adhere on the endothe-
lial surface, migrate and invade out of the vessel, and establish
themselves to form metastasis [3]. Currently, research on the
motility of cancer cells has garnered increased attention, since
the discovery of novel antimigratory compounds could lead
to new cancer treatments.
Several plants in the genus Dendrobium (Orchidaceae)
have long been used in traditional Chinesemedicine as tonics
[4]. Previous pharmacological studies showed that some
Dendrobium species were potential sources of cytotoxic com-
pounds [5]. A number of cytotoxic constituents have been
reported from Dendrobium, for example, dengraols A and B
from D. gratiosissimum Rchb. f. [6], erianin from D. chryso-
toxum Lindl. [7], and moscatilin from several Dendrobium
species [8].The compoundmoscatilin is of particular interest,
as it showed significant antimetastatic activity with relatively
low cytotoxicity [9, 10]. Dendrobium brymerianum Rchb. f. is
a plant found in Thailand, Burma, Laos, and China [11, 12].
Recently, some phenolic compounds have been identified
from this plant [12], but their cytotoxic and antimigratory
activities have not been examined. As part of our continuing
studies on anticancer agents from Dendrobium plants [13,
14], a MeOH extract obtained from the whole plant of D.
brymerianum was evaluated and found to possess significant
cytotoxicity against human lung cancer H460 cells, show-
ing 80% inhibition at a concentration of 50𝜇g/mL. This

prompted us to investigate the plant to identify the cytotoxic
components, as well as determine their antimigratory activity
against cancer cells.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. General. Mass spectra were recorded on a UPLC mass
spectrophotometer (Waters 2996-2695, ESI-MS). NMR spec-
tra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DPX-300 FT-NMR
spectrometer or a Varian Unity INOVA-500 NMR spectrom-
eter. Optical rotation was measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341
polarimeter. Vacuum-liquid column chromatography (VLC)
and column chromatography (CC) were performed on silica
gel 60 (Merck, Kieselgel 60, 70–320mesh), silica gel 60
(Merck, Kieselgel 60, 230–400mesh), and Sephadex LH-20
(25–100 𝜇m, Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd.).
2.2. Plant Material. Sample of D. brymerianum was pur-
chased from Jatujak market, Bangkok, Thailand, in Septem-
ber 2012 and identified by ProfessorThatree Phadungcharoen
(Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany,
Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn Uni-
versity). A voucher specimen (BS-DB-092555) is deposited
at the Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical
Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn
University, Bangkok, Thailand.
2.3. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered whole
plant (3 kg) was macerated with MeOH (3 × 10 L) to give
a MeOH extract (100 g) after removal of the solvent. This
material was fractionated by vacuum-liquid chromatography
(VLC) on silica gel (n-hexane-EtOAc gradient) to give 6
fractions (A–F). Fraction F (16.0 g) was separated by column
chromatography (CC) over silica gel and eluted with n-
hexane-EtOAc gradient, to give 11 fractions (FI–FXI). Frac-
tion FV (2.2 g) was separated on Sephadex LH20 (acetone)
to give 8 fractions (FV1–FV8). Compounds 1 (100mg) and
2 (47mg) were obtained from fraction FV4 (390mg) after
purification on Sephadex LH 20 (acetone). Fraction FV5
(1.0 g) was further purified on Sephadex LH 20 (acetone) to
furnish compound 3 (50mg). Purification of fraction FV6
(108mg) on Sephadex LH 20 (acetone) gave compound 4
(5mg). Fraction FVI (4.8 g) was separated by CC over silica
gel (CH
2
Cl
2
-EtOAc gradient) to yield 7 fractions (FVI1–
FVI7). Fraction FVI4 (1.7 g) was separated on Sephadex LH
20 (acetone) and further purified by CC (silica gel; CH
2
Cl
2
-
EtOAc, 9 : 1) to afford compounds 5 (6mg) and 6 (74mg),
respectively. Fraction FVI6 (93mg) was separated by CC
(silica gel; CH
2
Cl
2
-EtOAc, gradient) to give compounds 7
(6mg) and 8 (4mg), respectively.

2.4. Cells and Reagents. Lung cancer H460 cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured inRPMI 1640 containing
5% fetal bovine serum, 2mM l-glutamine, and 100 units/mL
penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO
2
environment at
37∘C. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) and other chemicals were obtained from
Sigma Chemical, Inc. (St. Louis, MO).
2.5. Cell Viability Assay. To determine cytotoxicity, cell via-
bility was determined by modified MTT assay [15] which
measured cellular capacity to reduce MTT (yellow) to purple
formazan crystal by mitochondrial dehydrogenase. The cells
were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well
plate and allowed to attach for 12 h, treated with different
concentrations of compounds in DMSO (with the final
concentration of DMSO less than 0.1% in each well) for 24 h,
and then incubated with 100 𝜇L of 500𝜇g/mL MTT solution
for 4 h at 37∘C.Then,MTT solution was removed, and 100 𝜇L
of 99.9% DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystal.
The intensity of formazan product was measured at 570 nm
using a microplate reader. All analyses were performed in at
least three independent replicate cultures. The cell viability
was calculated as follows:
Cell viability (%) =
A
570
of treatment
A
570
of untreated control
× 100. (1)
2.6. Assay for Antimigratory Activity. Migratory activity of
the cancer cells was evaluated by wound-healing assay [16].
Briefly, a monolayer of cells at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well
was cultured in 96-well plates, and a wound space was
created by a 1mm width tip. After rinsing with PBS, the
cell monolayers were treated with nontoxic concentration of
compounds (0.1𝜇g/mL) and allowed to migrate for 0–48 h.
Micrographs were taken under a phase-contrast microscope
(×100; Olympus IX51 with DP70), and wound spaces were
measured from 10 random fields of view using Olympus DP
Controller software. Quantitative analysis of cell migration
was performed by using an average wound space from ran-
dom fields of view, and the relative migration was calculated.

Figure 2: Effect of moscatilin (1) on H460 cell migration. (a) Confluent monolayer of H460 cells was wounded using a 1mm width tip and
treated with moscatilin (1) at 0.1 𝜇g/mL or without it for various times (0–48 h). Wound space was analyzed and represented as migration
level relative to the change of those in untreated cells. Data represent the mean ± SD (𝑛 = 3). ∗𝑃 < 0.05 versus untreated control cells. (b)
Wound space was visualized under a phase-contrast microscope at the indicated times.
2.7. Data/Statistical Analysis. All results from three or more
independent experiments were expressed as means ± SD.
Statistical differences between means were determined using
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post hoc test. A 𝑃
value of less than 0.05 (𝑃 < 0.05) was considered statistically
significant. The IC
50
value was obtained using the GraphPad
Prism software.
2.8. Determination of Total Phenolic Content. The total phe-
nolic content (TPC) was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu
method [17]. Assays were conducted in a 96-well microtiter
plate. Briefly, 20𝜇L of the plant extract solution (0.5mg/mL
in ethanol) was added to 1 : 10 diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
(100 𝜇L). After 5 minutes, 100 𝜇L of Na
2
CO
3
(75 g/100mL
in deionized water) was added. After incubation at room
temperature for 1 hr, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm
using a Perkin-Elmer Victor3 1420 multilabel counter. Gallic
acid (Sigma) was used as a reference standard, and the total
phenolic content was expressed asmg of gallic acid equivalent
(GAE)/g dried plant material.
3. Results and Discussion
The total phenolic content of the dried plant material was
found to be 1.13mgGAE/g, whichwas in the same level as that
of Dendrobium nobile [18]. Chromatographic separation of

Figure 3: Effect of gigantol (3) on H460 cell migration. (a) The cells were wounded and treated with gigantol (3) at 0.1 𝜇g/mL or without it
for various times (0–48 h). Wound space was analyzed and represented as migration level relative to the change of those in untreated cells.

this MeOH extract resulted in the isolation of eight phenolic
compounds which included moscatilin (1) [19], flavanthrinin
(2) [20], gigantol (3) [21], lusianthridin (4) [22], nobilone
(5) [23], dendroflorin (6) [24], denchrysan B (7) [25], and
tristin (8) [21].The structures of these isolates (Figure 1) were
determined through analysis of their 1H NMR, 13C NMR,
and MS data in comparison with previously reported values.
Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8were not found in the previous
study [12].
Compounds 1–8 were evaluated for cytotoxicity against
human lung cancer H460 cells using established protocols
[15], and the results are summarized in Table 1. It can be
seen that, apart from moscatilin (1) which has been earlier
reported for cytotoxic and antimigratory effects [9], only
gigantol (3), lusianthridin (4), and dendroflorin (6) exhibited
appreciable cytotoxic properties, whereas the others were
inactive (IC
50
> 200𝜇g/mL). From these preliminary limited
data it could be speculated that the stronger cytotoxicity of
the extract, as compared with the individual components,
was probably due to the additive or synergistic effects
from the eight phenolic (1–8) and/or other unisolated com-
pounds. Compounds 3, 4, and 6 were further investigated
for antimigratory potential in comparison with 1, using a
modified method of the wound-healing assay [16]. In a
previous report, moscatilin (1) showed inhibition against
the migration of breast MDA-MB-231 cells [10] and thus

could serve as a positive control in this study. In the present
examination, each compound was evaluated for antimigra-
tory activity at a noncytotoxic concentration (0.1𝜇g/mL) to
avoid the possible interfering cytotoxic effect. The human
lung cancer H460 cells were then allowed to migrate in the
presence or absence of the test compound for 0, 6, 12, 24,
and 48 h, after which the migratory activity was measured.
The results, as shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, indicated
that each of the tested compounds exhibited significant
antimigratory activity in comparison with the untreated
control. As summarized in Figure 6, all of the compounds
(1, 3, 4, and 6) inhibited the migration of the cells across the
wound space in a time-dependent manner. During the first
24 h, dendroflorin (6) appeared to be the strongest anti-
migratory compound; however, after 48 h, moscatilin (1)
became the most potent compound, as a result of the sub-
stantial increase of its activity during the period of 24–
48 h. It should be mentioned that the antimigratory effects
of moscatilin (1) and gigantol (3) have been earlier demon-
strated in other cancer cells, for example, human lung
H23 and breast MDA-MB-231 cells [9, 10, 26]. Additionally,
gigantol (3) has been shown to suppress lung cancer cell
migration through a caveolin-1-dependent pathway [26]. It
is worth noting that, among the compounds tested in this
study, gigantol (3) was the weakest antimigratory agent
despite its strong cytotoxicity, suggesting that no linear

correlation exists between cytotoxicity and antimigratory
activity.
It is known that cell migration may be regulated by
the caveolin-1 and/or the protein kinase B (Akt) signaling
pathway [27]. In certain cases, particularly in lung cancer
migration, overexpression of caveolin-1 is believed to play the
predominant role [16]. The apparent high level of caveolin-
1 expression in H460 cells in this study (data not shown)
might suggest the involvement of caveolin-1 in the cancer cell
migration, although more detailed studies are needed before
any conclusion can be drawn.
4. Conclusion
In summary, in this communication we provide new infor-
mation on the cytotoxic and antimigratory effects of the phe-
nolic compounds isolated from Dendrobium brymerianum.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the
biological activities of this plant. Our findings on the antimi-
gratory activities of moscatilin (1) and gigantol (3) are in
agreement with earlier reports. In addition, our preliminary
data revealed for the first time the antimigratory potential
of lusianthridin (4) and dendroflorin (6). The biological data
