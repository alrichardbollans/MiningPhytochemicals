Costa1, Sı´lvia Albano1, Rui Santos11CCMAR - Centro de Cieˆncias do Mar, Faro, Portugal, 2CECTA - Centro de Estudos em Cieˆncias e Tecnologias Agra´rias, Universidade do Algarve, Faro, PortugalAbstractThe effects of light-limitation stress were investigated in natural stands of the seagrasses Zostera marina and Cymodoceanodosa in Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, southern Portugal. Three levels of light attenuation were imposed for 3 weeks in twoadjacent meadows (2–3 m depth), each dominated by one species. The response of photosynthesis to light was determinedwith oxygen electrodes. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).Soluble protein, carbohydrates, malondialdehyde and phenol contents were also analysed. Both species showed evidentsigns of photoacclimation. Their maximum photosynthetic rates were significantly reduced with shading. Ratios betweenspecific light harvesting carotenoids and the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids revealed significantly higherlight harvesting efficiency of C. nodosa, a competitive advantage in a low light environment. The contents of both solublesugars and starch were considerably lower in Z. marina plants, particularly in the rhizomes, decreasing even further withshading. The different carbohydrate energy storage strategies found between the two species clearly favour C. nodosa’sresilience to light deprivation, a condition enhanced by its intrinsic arrangement of the pigment pool. On the other hand, Z.marina revealed a lower tolerance to light reduction, mostly due to a less plastic arrangement of the pigment pool andlower carbohydrate storage. Our findings indicate that Z. marina is close to a light-mediated ecophysiological threshold inRia Formosa.Citation: Silva J, Barrote I, Costa MM, Albano S, Santos R (2013) Physiological Responses of Zostera marina and Cymodocea nodosa to Light-Limitation Stress.

Theseare generally attributed to man-induced disturbances that lead toeutrophication and siltation, which deteriorate the light environ-ment for these plants [1], [2], [3]. However, the mechanisticprocesses of physiological decline that ultimately lead to seagrasslosses are not yet clear, partially because seagrass light require-ments are not well understood. Published literature addressing theeffects of light on seagrass photosynthesis has been recentlyreviewed [4]. The authors concluded that, despite the severalpublished reports on the effects of light reduction on seagrassphotosynthesis, morphology, growth and survival, essentialknowledge on the underlying physiological mechanisms of lightharvesting and resource allocation is still missing. Addedconstraints preventing generic assumptions for seagrasses are theinterspecific variety of ecological strategies, growth rates, morpho-logical and photosynthetic plasticity, photoacclimation potentialand energy management strategies.Following light reduction events, physiological responses are thefirst to occur, preceding morphological changes and the eventualbiomass loss [5]. However, the type of response of differentseagrass species to light reduction and/or deprivation appears tobe highly related to specific morphology and leaf turnover rates[4]. Whereas smaller and faster-growing species are able toincrease their leaf length or even replace them by new leaves, moreadapted to low-light conditions, larger and slow-growing speciesmust rely more on their capacity to adjust the photosyntheticapparatus and regulate the processes of light acquisition andenergy conversion and storage. Adjustments in the photosyntheticapparatus to low light usually involve an overall increase of totalchlorophyll and a reduction of the chlorophyll a:b ratio [6] as aform of increasing photosynthetic efficiency, while the mobiliza-tion of carbohydrate reserves, mostly from rhizomes, provides acarbon source necessary to sustain growth [7], [5]. Ultimately,dealing with light reduction is an energetic balance issue, as plantstry to optimize light energy harvesting while making the bestpossible use of stored carbon energy. The result of this interplaydictates the relative success with which seagrass species deal withperiods of light reduction.Of critical importance to understanding the light harvestingmechanism and its photoacclimation potential is detailed knowl-edge of the photosynthetic pigment pool. Light harvesting systemsare able to adjust their operating efficiency to the lightenvironment, shifting from high efficiency when light is limitingto photosynthesis, to lower efficiency when there is too much light.The modulation of photosynthetic pigments and soluble proteincontents, as well as their balance, are part of this process andcontribute to attaining a proper equilibrium between the energyinput and output. In addition to chlorophyll a and b, the antennaeof light harvesting complexes of terrestrial plants containneoxanthin, lutein epoxide plus lutein and violaxanthin. WhereasPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81058chlorophyll a and b are always the main light capturing antennaepigments, higher proportions of neoxanthin, lutein epoxide andviolaxanthin have been associated with more efficient light-harvesting antennae, eventually becoming acclimated to shadyenvironments, and less prone to switch to the photoprotectivemode [8], [9], [10].In seagrasses, however, the analysis of photosynthetic pigmentshas so far been restricted to the quantification of chlorophylls andtotal carotenoids, whereas detailed analysis of the photosyntheticcarotenoid pool has been scarce. Exceptions are [11], where theauthors screened extracts from four Mediterranean seagrassspecies to identify the presence of the major photosyntheticcarotenoids, [12] with the description of the diel evolution of thexanthophyll cycle pigments in Z. marina and [13], analysing thedepth dependence of several carotenoids in Posidonia sinuosa. Herewe present a comprehensive quantification of the photosyntheticcarotenoid pool of Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina, describingthe occurrence of seven photosynthetic carotenoids, with diversephysiological functions, from light harvesting to photooxidationprevention. Assessing the responses of the photosynthetic carot-enoid pool to light reduction opens the way to further researchaiming a better understanding of how seagrasses respond totransient or permanent shifts in their light environment, allowing amore detailed insight of the photo-physiological processes under-lying such responses.The aim of this study was to compare the short-termphysiological responses of Z. marina and C. nodosa to differentlevels of light reduction. Specific objectives were (i) to investigatethe effects of light reduction on the photosynthetic activity, (ii) toevaluate changes in the composition of the photosyntheticpigments pools and (iii) to examine the dynamics of carbohydratesynthesis, allocation and use in the above- and below-groundtissues.Materials and MethodsExperimental designNo specific permissions were required to conduct the fieldexperiments nor to collect biological samples in Ria Formosacoastal lagoon, according to the current national legislation. Thiswork did not involve any endangered or protected species.Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina co-occur in the shallowsubtidal of Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (South Portugal, 37uN, 8uW). Three levels of light attenuation were imposed in situ on bothZ. marina and C. nodosa growing in two adjacent meadows at3 m depth on February 2011. Five square plots (1 m2) wereestablished per treatment using metallic structures covered withPVC mesh to obtain 24, 40 and 75% light attenuation relatively toambient photosynthetic active radiation, PAR. Ambient PAR at3 m depth reached maximum mid-day values of ca. 300 mmolquanta m22s21, throughout the experiment duration. In theshaded plots, maximum PAR was 228, 180 and 75 mmol quantam22s21 (respectively 24, 40 and 75% attenuation). The shadescreens were cleaned every two days to prevent fouling. Theshading treatments were imposed for 3 weeks, at the end of whichplant samples were collected for photosynthetic measurements andbiochemical analysis. Control plants were collected in the naturalmeadows close to the shaded plots. Plants for biochemical analysiswere collected, brought under shade to the surface, immediatelycleaned of epiphytes, separated into leaves, rhizomes and roots,dried from excess water with paper tissue and frozen in liquidnitrogen. Plants for photosynthetic measurements were kept undershade and immersed in seawater for transportation to thelaboratory, where they were kept overnight in a growth chamber,set to emulate the in situ measured temperature (15uC).Light response curvesThe response of seagrass photosynthesis to the shadingtreatments was evaluated through P-E curves, measured with anoxygen electrode system (DW3/CB1, Hansatech, Norfolk, UK).Actinic light was provided by a slide projector (Pradovit 150,Leica, Germany) equipped with a halogen lamp (Osram Xenophot150 W). A series of neutral density filters mounted on slide frameswere used to obtain different light intensities. For each P-E curve,two leaf segments (2nd–3rd youngest leaves) of each replicate(n = 5) of either Z. marina or C. nodosa were clipped and mountedvertically side by side inside the measuring chamber for an evenexposure to the incident light. GF/F filtered seawater (35%) wasused in the reaction vessel. The incubation chamber was coupledto a magnetic stirrer, which provided water homogenisation.Water temperature was kept constant at 15uC, controlled by athermostatic circulator (Raypa, Spain). For each replicate curve,10 light levels were applied sequentially, increasing from 5 to875 mmol quanta m22s21 (PAR). Between light level exposures,the water from the reaction vessel was replaced by new water fromthe same original stock, previously brought to the measuringtemperature. This water renewal prevents both oxygen super-saturation in the reaction chamber, with potential inhibitoryeffects on photosynthesis, and also the occurrence of significant pHdrifts [14]. Each light level was imposed for approximately 8 min,enough time to obtain a straight line in the oxygen recordingsystem, assumed as steady-state photosynthesis. P-E curves werefitted with the model equation of Smith and Talling [15], [16].P~PmaEPm2z aEð Þ2 1226643775in which E is the irradiance, a is the ascending slope at limitingirradiances, and Pm is the maximum photosynthetic rate. Curveswere fitted iteratively using SigmaPlot 11.0 and the parameters Pmand a as well as their standard error were estimated for aconfidence interval of 95%. The saturation irradiance, Ik, wascalculated as the ratio between the estimated Pm and a for eachtreatment, incorporating error propagation.Photosynthetic pigmentsPhotosynthetic pigments were extracted in 100 mg frozen leafsamples ground in liquid nitrogen in the presence of sodiumascorbate. Pigments where extracted with 5 mL 100% acetonebuffered with CaCO3 [17]. The extracts were sequentially filteredwith LS 5.0 mm membrane filters and hydrophobic PTFE 0.2 mmfilters, and stored in the dark at 220uC until analysis. Theextraction procedure took place under low light environment.Chlorophyll a (Ca) and b (Cb) were quantified by spectrophoto-metric absorbance reading, using the equations of Lichtenthalerand Buschmann [18]. Carotenoids were analysed in an isocraticHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), as describedin [19] after [20]. HPLC calibration [20] was done usingcommercially available pigments (CaroteNature, Lupsingen,Switzerland). Liquid chromatography analysis was performed inan Alliance Waters 2695 separation module (Milford MA, USA),with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector and a WatersNovapak C18 radial 86100 mm compression column (4 mmparticle size). 20 mL of extract were injected via an auto-sampler.Shading Effects on Z. marina and C. nodosaPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81058During the injection period, extracts were maintained at 5uC andthe column was kept at a constant temperature of 24uC. All eluentswere prepared with HPLC grade solvents (VWR HipersolvChromanorm), filtered and sonicated prior to use. Peak areaswere monitored at 450 nm and concentrations were calculatedbased on peak areas obtained for standards at known concentra-tions, calculated based on absorbance measured in a Beckman-Coulter DU 650 spectrophotometer (Brea CA, USA). Thexanthophyll cycle epoxidation state (EPS) was calculated basedon violaxanthin (V) anteraxanthin (A) and zeaxanthin (Z) foliarconcentrations as in [21]: EPS = (V+0.5A)/(V+A+Z).Soluble proteinFrozen leaf samples (150 mg each) were ground in 1.5 mL ofprotein extraction buffer (100 mM Potassium phosphate, pH 7.8,1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 2% (v/v) Triton-X). The extract wascentrifuged at 180006g for 2 min at 4uC and the supernatant wascollected. Soluble protein concentration was determined by a dye-binding assay (Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye) [22], against aBovine Serum Albumin standard (BioRad).Non-structural carbohydratesFreeze-dried samples of leaves and rhizomes (n = 5, 10 mg DWeach) were ground to powder on a ball mill, extracted in ethanol at80uC for 10 min. and centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min. [23]. Thesupernatant was collected and the pellet was ressuspended inethanol for additional extraction. This procedure was repeated athird time to allow full extraction of soluble sugars (glucose,sucrose and fructose). The supernatants from the three-stepextraction were mixed together and the amount of soluble sugarswas determined by a phenol-sulphuric assay [24] using glucosestandards. For starch quantification, the pellet was washed indeionised water, centrifuged, ressuspended again in water(repeated three times) and autoclaved for 15 min. Starch washydrolysed to glucose in the presence of an enzymatic complex(14 U/ml amyloglucosidase and 1000 U/mg a-amylase persample) and determined as glucose equivalents following thephenol-sulphuric assay described above.Total phenolsFrozen leaf samples (ca. 200 mg fresh weight) were powdered inliquid nitrogen and total phenols were extracted and quantified asin [25], [26]. Extracts were suspended in 0.1 mol L21 HCl andkept overnight at 4uC in the dark, under constant agitation.Following centrifugation, 0.25 N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and7.5% Na2CO3 were added to the supernatant. Absorbance wasread at 724 nm in a Beckman Coulter DU-650 spectrophotometer(Brea CA, USA), against a blank sample. The assay results wereexpressed as chlorogenic acid equivalents.Malondialdehyde (MDA)For MDA extraction, ca. 300 mg of frozen leaf samples wereground to powder in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 80%aqueous ethanol. After centrifugation the supernatant was addedto a solution of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with 0.65%thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and 0.015% butylated hydroxytoluene(BHT). Two blanks were done either without TBA or with 80%ethanol instead of sample extract. All samples and blanks reactionmixtures were heated (90uC, 25 min), then cooled (ice bath,15 min) and again centrifuged. Absorbances were read in thesupernatants at 532 nm, 600 nm and 440 nm using a BeckmanCoulter DU-650 spectrophotometer and MDA equivalents werecalculated as in [27].Statistical analysisAll results are presented as mean values 6 standard error ofreplicate samples (n = 5), except when noted differently. When notstated otherwise, one or two way ANOVAs were applied to testsignificant effects (p,0.05). Student-Newman-Keuls post-hocmethod was used to reveal significant differences betweenindividual means [28]. All data treatment and statistical analysiswas performed using the SigmaStat/SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., v.11)software package.ResultsLight response curvesThe maximum photosynthetic rates of both Zostera marina andCymodocea nodosa were significantly reduced with the shadingtreatment (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In Z. marina plants, reductions in Pmincreased with the shading level, with significant differences fromcontrol to all the shading levels, with the 75% shading leveldisplaying the lowest Pm. In C. nodosa, all levels showed significantdifferences in Pm relative to the control but not among them; theplants under 75% shading were the exception, with significantlyhigher Pm than 24% and 40% shading levels. With the exceptionof the highest shading level, Z. marina Pm rates were alwayssignificantly higher (three-fold or more) than those of C. nodosa.The ascending slope at limiting PPFDs (a) decreased in Z. marinafrom the control to all the shading levels, while in C. nodosa anopposite trend was observed, with all the shading levels displayinghigher a values than control plants (Table 1). The saturationirradiance (Ik) of Z. marina was not affected by shading, whereas inC. nodosa it decreased at least four-fold from the control to allshading levels, with no significant differences among these(Table 1).Photosynthetic pigmentsThe total chlorophyll/soluble protein ratio in Z. marina leavesincreased with shading (Fig. 2), up to 2.6 fold at the 75% shadinglevel. In C. nodosa, the ratio peaked at the 24% level, the only onewith a significant difference from the control. The ChlT/proteinratio was higher in C. nodosa than in Z. marina, with significantdifferences observed both in control and 40% shading levels.In both species, the photosynthetic carotenoids neoxanthin,lutein epoxide + lutein (LxL), violaxanthin and b –carotenepresented identical patterns of response to shading (Fig. 3 A–D). InC. nodosa, none of these pigments showed a significant differenceamong treatments, whereas in Z. marina their concentrationincreased only at the 75% shading level, by a factor of 2.3 inneoxanthin, LxL and violaxanthin and 1.8 in b – Carotene.The epoxidation state (EPS) of Z. marina was lower than that ofC. nodosa in control plants and in those submitted to the twolowest shading levels, being identical at the 75% treatment (Fig. 4).The EPS index of Z. marina increased significantly at all levels,whereas in C. nodosa it did not respond to the shading treatment.Table 2 summarizes total chlorophyll contents and pigmentratios that were not significantly affected by shading for bothspecies. Significant interspecific differences are indicated. Theaverage total chlorophyll content was nearly two-fold higher in C.nodosa and the ratios of lutein epoxide per total chlorophyll andper total VAZ pool were also 3.4 and 6.6 times higher,respectively, than in Z. marina. The ratio of total VAZ per totalchlorophyll was two-fold higher in the later species.Non-structural carbohydratesZ. marina and C. nodosa control plants presented an identical levelof soluble sugars in the leaves and this level declined significantlyShading Effects on Z. marina and C. nodosaPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81058with shading in both species (Fig. 5 A and B). However, C. nodosacontrol plants had ca. 3.5 fold more soluble sugar stored in therhizomes than Z. marina and this high level was not affected byshading. The rhizome sugar content of Z. marina decreasedbetween 70 and 85% in relation to control. In addition, Z. marinaand C. nodosa control leaves showed identical starch contents (Fig. 5C and D), and in both species a decrease was only observed underthe highest shading level. In contrast, C. nodosa control plants hadnearly four-fold more starch stored in the rhizomes than Z. marina,showing only a significant decrease at the highest shading level.MDA and phenolsMDA foliar content was not significantly affected by shading inC. nodosa whereas in Z. marina it showed a significant increase onlyat 75% shading (Fig. 6 A). MDA values were always similar inboth species except at 75% shading. Total phenols increased withshading in both species (Fig. 6 B). Z. marina plants always hadsignificantly higher phenol content than C. nodosa.DiscussionShading induced significant alterations in the photosyntheticapparatus of both Zostera marina and Cymodocea nodosa, as revealedFigure 1. Light response curves of Zostera marina and Cymodocea nodosa. Plants submitted to shading treatments of 24, 40 and 75% ofnaturally available photosynthetically active radiation (CTRL). The model equation of Smith and Talling [15] [16] was adjusted to the observed points.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081058.g001Shading Effects on Z. marina and C. nodosaPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81058by the decrease of their photosynthetic activity (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Both species showed a continuous, yet distinct, photoacclimatoryresponse. In Z. marina the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pm)decreased with the shade levels, revealing a decreased capacity tophotosynthesize as well as a lower photosynthetic efficiency,expressed by a reduction in the ascending slope of the light-limitedpart of the P-E curve (a). As Pm and a decreased proportionally,the saturation irradiance (Ik) didn’t change significantly with theshading levels, In contrast, the decrease of Pm in C. nodosa wasaccompanied by a significant increase of the photosyntheticefficiency at low light intensities (a, resulting in a decrease (to lessthan 20%) in Ik. The higher photosynthetic efficiency of C. nodosaat low light intensities may even be amplified by its higher contenton total chlorophyll (Table 2), supporting the hypothesis that C.nodosa is generally more able to deal with low light conditions thanZ. marina.Both C. nodosa and Z. marina presented foliar chl a/b ratios below2.5 (Table 2), values frequently attributed to shade leaves interrestrial plants [29]. Additionally, C. nodosa displayed higher Lx/ChlT and Lx/VAZ ratios and lower VAZ/ChlT and b-car/ChlTratios than Z. marina. This is typical of shade acclimated leaves [30]and points to a higher light harvesting efficiency, advantageous ina low light environment where less excitation energy reaches thereaction centres, which become underused unless the light capturecapacity is enhanced. However, in an apparent contradiction, C.nodosa control plants presented significantly lower photosyntheticefficiency than Z. marina. This might be explained by potentiallyhigher rates of oxygen consuming processes such as photorespi-ration, Mehler reaction, cellular respiration, chlororespiration andmitochondrial alternative oxidase pathway [31], [32], [33], [34] innon-shaded C. nodosa plants. Some of these processes, namelyphotorespiration, Mehler reaction and cellular respiration, alsoproduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) [35], which induce theperoxidation of cellular membrane lipids and lead to theproduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) [36]. Thus, higher rates ofthose metabolic pathways should be reflected on higher MDAvalues in C. nodosa, particularly in control plants. As well, assumingthat the rate of those metabolic pathways would decrease withshade, so would the MDA content. This decrease of oxygenconsuming processes with shade would be in line with the increaseof the photosynthetic efficiency (a). However, there were nodifferences on the MDA content of C. nodosa plants under thedifferent shading treatments (Fig. 6 A), meaning that either therewas no change on the amount of ROS production or, most likely,there was an efficient ROS scavenging machinery operating incontrol plants and keeping ROS below the limit from which theycause significant oxidative stress. In Z. marina the intensification ofshading was followed by the increment on oxidative stress, whichreached its maximum at 75% shading level (Fig. 6 A). In thisspecies the increment on oxidative stress was accompanied by asignificant decrease on photosynthetic efficiency (a, which couldbe related to the up regulation of O2 consuming biochemicalpathways. Unlike C. nodosa, Z. marina is reported to havephotorespiration [37], but the up regulation of photorespiration,Mehler reaction and chlororespiration is commonly related withhigh light intensities and/or temperature stress, but not withshading. Nonetheless, an increment on oxidative stress in theaquatic macrophyte Potamogeton crispus was attributed to theunbalance of C-N metabolism under low light [38]. This kind ofmechanism could be simultaneously responsible for the increase ofoxidative stress in Z. marina, and for the maintenance of the MDAlevels in C. nodosa. Plant phenolic compounds are carbon basedand are believed to act as antioxidants [39] [40]. The likelydecrease in O2-consuming metabolic pathways together with theincrease on leaf phenols seems to have contributed to themaintenance of MDA concentrations in shaded C. nodosa plants.In Z. marina, the increase on total phenols was not enough toprevent oxidative stress, which in turn may be related to thedecrease of a with shading, since ROS are known to decrease therate of repair of photosystem II [41]. Leaf total phenols werealways higher in Z. marina then in C. nodosa, probably due toconstitutive differences between the two species.Table 1.

Nevertheless it was only at the 75%shading level that significant increases of the neoxanthin, luteinpool, violaxanthin and b-carotene foliar contents (Figs. 2 and 3)were detected in Z. marina. Although most pigment content andratios were higher in C. nodosa regardless of light treatment (Table 2and Fig. 3), this difference was attenuated by the increment on Z.marina photosynthetic pigments as shade treatment increased(Fig. 3). The foliar concentrations of b-carotene and of thexanthophylls neoxanthin, lutein epoxide plus lutein (LxL), andviolaxanthin were always significantly higher in control C. nodosaplants (Fig. 3), being neoxanthin and LxL foliar contents similar tothe median values found in several shade leaves of different species[30]. The xanthophylls violaxanthin, neoxanthin and Lx havebeen associated to a more stable and efficient structure of theLHCII, thus contributing to more efficient light harvesting andtransmission of excitation energy to chlorophyll a [9] [10] [42][43] [44]. b-carotene is a precursor of xanthophylls [45] and itsincrement in Z. marina leaves in response to the highest level ofshading might be related with the need for neoxanthin andFigure 3.

On the other hand the difference in theLxL content between the two species resulted mainly from thedifference in the lutein epoxide (Lx) content, which wassignificantly higher in C. nodosa, both on a total chlorophyll andon a xanthophyll cycle pigments basis (data not shown). Theepoxidation state (EPS = (V + 0.5A)/VAZ) reflects the proportionof the VAZ cycle pigments that resulted from the epoxidation ofzeaxanthin [21]. Shading did not induce any alteration in C. nodosaEPS but this index increased significantly in Z. marina (Fig. 4),mainly due to the significant increase in violaxanthin. At the 75%shading level, the foliar concentration of violaxanthin wassignificantly higher in Z. marina than in C. nodosa, whoseviolaxanthin levels were unaffected by the shading treatments.These pigment data indicate that C. nodosa has a constitutivelyhigher efficiency on light processing at the antennae level whencompared to Z. marina, which changed its pigment contents toacquire a better capacity to use light as shading increased.The epoxidation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin is an O2and energy consuming process [46]. Thus the epoxidation ofzeaxanthin to violaxanthin may also contribute to lowerphotosynthetic efficiency and competes with other metabolicprocesses for energy, adding yet another disadvantage for Z. marinaunder low light conditions.Zostera marina is a shallow growing species, most likely due to itsrelatively high light requirement [23]. In Ria Formosa, theseplants grow in their southern distribution limit in Europe, wherethe high summer temperatures lead to increased respiratory ratesand the plant carbon balance may be negative, as is the case in theeast American coast [47]. On the other hand, winter conditions ofincreased turbidity reduce the available light and require anefficient photoacclimation as a condition to maintain a positivecarbon balance. Z. marina has been previously reported as beingable to photoacclimate to low irradiance levels under summerconditions [48] and in a much lesser degree also during winterperiods, where it is much more vulnerable [49]. In this study,whereas some photoacclimation effort was evidenced, namely inthe adjustment of the photosynthetic rates and the pigments pool,it appears that the crucial factor playing against Z. marina was itscarbon allocation strategy.Under reduced light conditions, sea-grasses mobilize stored carbohydrates to maintain metabolicFigure 5.

Plants submitted to shading treatments of 24, 40 and 75% of naturally available photosynthetically active radiation (CTRL).

Our data show that Z. marina, while normallymaintaining leaf soluble sugar levels identical to C. nodosa, had ca.3.5 fold less sugars stored in the rhizomes (control plants data).Furthermore, while [50], [23] reported higher (up to 10 times)soluble sugar contents in the rhizomes than in the leaves of Z.marina, in our study rhizomes had only ca. 1.6 times more sugarthan leaves, in control plants. After shading, sugar levels werealways significantly lower in rhizomes than in leaves, indicating asevere degradation of the energy storage conditions. Finally, theabsolute values of soluble sugars determined in this study for bothleaves and rhizomes were 4 to 6 times lower than those found inCalifornian populations of Z. marina by [49]. Similarly lower valueswere reported by [23] for plants collected in the southerndistribution limit of this species in the east American coast, whichcorroborates the idea that Z. marina’s apparent limited flexibility toallocate and use carbohydrate reserves is greatly evidenced closerto its southern distribution limits. Relatively low starch values alsoappear to be characteristic of this species [47], [23], probably asmeans of saving inter-conversion energy and maintaining a morereadily available energy source. The fact is that in this study norhizome starch mobilization was observed after the shadingtreatment. On the other hand, C. nodosa showed only somedecrease in the leaf sugar content in response to shading and therhizome pool was not affected. The leaf and rhizome starchcontents only declined following the most severe level of theshading treatment.The different carbohydrate energy storage strategies shownbetween C. nodosa and Z. marina clearly favour C. nodosa’s resilienceto light deprivation. This C. nodosa’s carbohydrate storage strategyis also likely to be beneficial in response to other environmentaldisturbances, besides being effective in coping with light reduction.For example, it has been shown that C. nodosa is highly resilient todisturbances such as burial and transplanting [51], [52], [53].Although the effects of the different shading levels are noticeablein some aspects, what emerges as the most striking outcome of thisexperiment is the remarkable difference between the strategiesadopted by the two species in dealing with a short-term decline inlight availability. This difference configures C. nodosa as a moreresilient species to transient light attenuation periods, mostly dueto its constitutive arrangement of the pigment pool and to itscarbohydrate storage and allocation strategy. On the other hand,Z. marina revealed a lower tolerance to light reduction, mostly dueto a higher energy-requiring re-arrangement of the pigment poolunder low-light conditions and also to a less effective strategy ofcarbohydrate storage and use.The results suggest that Z. marina is close to a light mediatedecophysiological threshold in Ria Formosa, with only a shortmargin to deal with transient changes in light availability, whichare common in a costal system such as Ria Formosa lagoon. Thus,potentially increasing disturbances in the light environment of thelagoon can only further contribute to its decline. On the otherhand, our results also indicate that this kind of experimentalapproach can be a useful tool to investigate interspecificcompetition processes from the ecophysiological point of view,particularly as it allows some degree of trend prediction based onthe specific photophysiological characteristics and acclimationpotential of target species.AcknowledgmentsWe deeply thank Pedro Neves, the Diving and Safety Officer atUniversidade do Algarve, for the fundamental assistance in setting upthe experiment and all the help in the sampling process.
