Abstract: Two flavonoid glycosides 1 and 2 having the luteolin structure were iso-
lated from flowers of the endemic plant species Cephalaria pastricensis. They were
identified by 1H and 13C NMR, as well as UV/Vis spectroscopy. The structures of 1
and 2 were also confirmed by the spectral data of aglycones and TLC of the sugars
obtained after acid hydrolysis. Flavones 1 and 2 showed significant antiradical ac-
tivity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay.
Keywords: Cephalaria pastricensis, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, luteolin 7-O-arabi-
no(1-6)glucoside, antiradical activity, DPPH assay.
INTRODUCTION
The genus Cephalaria (famiuly Dipsacaceae) comprises about 30 species,
which are widespread, mainly in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.
Cephalaria pastricensis Doerfl. et Hay is an endemic species that can be found on
the high mountains of North Albania, Montenegro and the Serbian–Bosnian border.1
No previous phytochemical work on this species has been reported. Some isolation
studies were carried out on several Cephalaria species, which have been used in folk
medicine for their hypothermal, alleviative, relaxant and anti-infective activities.2
Hitherto, quite a few biologically active secondary metabolites have been iso-
lated from the species of this genus: triterpenoid saponins, iridoid glycosides, and
flavonoids.3–5
Flavonoids comprise a large group of secondary plant metabolites. Presently
more than 5000 individual compounds are known. Their function in plants also in-

volves the absorption of UV light and radical scavenging. There is an increasing
interest in antioxidants such as flavonoids, particularly in those intended to prevent
the presumed deleterious effects of free radicals in the human body, and to prevent
the deterioration of fats and other constituents of food. Numerous papers exist on
their inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Due to their structural variety, the flavonoids
also offer themselves for detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.6
The antioxidant effect of flavonoids can reside both in their radical-scavenging ac-
tivity or in their metal-chelating properties, of which the former may dominate.
In this paper, the isolation and structural elucidation of two flavonoids, luteolin
7-glucoside (1) and luteolin 7-arabino(1-6)glucoside (2) are reported. Their antiradical
properties were measured using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test.
EXPERIMENTAL
General
1H (200 MHz) and 13C (50 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 2000 spec-
trometer in DMSO-d6. UV spectra and optical density were measured on a Cintra 40 UV-visible
spectrometer. Silica gel (0.063–0.200 mm) and Sephadex LH-20 were used for column chromatog-
raphy (CC). Silica gel F-254 was used for analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC).
Plant material
The flowers of Cephalaria pastricensis were collected in July 2000 at Veliki Stolac, mount
Zvijezda, Serbian–Bosnian border. A voucher specimen, with the accession number CP28072003, is
deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade – Herbarium Code
BEOU.
Extraction and isolation
The ground, air-dried flowers (150 g) were extracted with methanol–water (9:1, 3400 ml) at
room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and 6.5 g of extract was ob-
tained. This was fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 using methanol as the eluent. The fractions con-
taining flavonoids (analysed by TLC) were combined to yield 3.5 g after evaporation of the solvent.
The crude mixture of flavonoids was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The elu-
tion was commenced with chloroform–methanol–water (20:6.5:0.5) and the polarity was gradually
increased (20:10:1, A; 20:11:2, B; 20:18:6, C). Fractions (5510 ml) were collected and analyzed by
TLC. Compounds 1 (15 mg) and 2 (20 mg) were precipitated as yellow crystals from the fractions
eluted with B and C, respectively.
Acid hydrolysis of flavonoids
Solutions of compound 1 (5 mg) and 2 (5 mg) in 5 ml 6 % HCl were heated for 5 h. The reaction
mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (aglycone) and the aqueous fraction (sug-
ars) were concentrated for identification. The sugars were identified by TLC (acetonitrile–water
85:15) by comparison with authentic samples.

DPPH assay
The DPPH assay was performed according to the modified method of Kirbi and Schmidt.7 The
analytical samples for DPPH measurements (in triplicate) were prepared by mixing methanolic so-
lutions of compounds 1 and 2 (200 l), at 7 different concentrations, with 1000 l of 500 M DPPH
(in MeOH) and 800 l of 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4). The samples were shaken vigorously and
kept in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 517 nm. The DPPH con-
trol (containing no sample) was prepared using the same procedure.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The structural assignments of 1 and 2 were based on the identity of their spec-
tral data to those published in the literature.8 The constitution of the aromatic parts
was also confirmed by comparison of the spectra of the aglycones, obtained by
acid hydrolysis, to those of luteolin. The sugar anomeric configurations were con-
firmed by their JH,H-coupling constants.
While luteolin 7-glucoside is widespread in plant species,9–11 and also in
some Cephalaria species,12 isolation of luteolin 7-arabino(1–6)glucoside has been
reported in only one paper to date.8
The DPPH radical scavenging method is a standard procedure applied to the
evaluation of anti-radical activity.13 A parameter introduced recently for the inter-
pretation of the results from the DPPH method is the “efficient concentration” or
EC50 value. This is defined as the concentration of the substrate that causes 50 %
loss of the DPPH activity. The EC50 values were calculated by the linear regression
method of plots of the percent of antiradical activity against the concentration of
the tested compounds.14
As shown in Fig. 1, the isolated flavonoids demonstrated almost the same sig-
nificant inhibitory activity. The similar activity of 1 and 2 is to be expected, since
they exhibit the same oxygenation pattern. This also fits to reported structure–acti-
vity relationship studies.15
