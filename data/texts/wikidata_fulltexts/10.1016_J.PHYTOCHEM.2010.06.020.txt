The phytochemical investigation of the ethyl acetate 27 extract obtained from the heartwood led to the isolation of 18 secondary metabolites, 28 including 6 moracins [the new 6-O-methyl-moracin M (3), 6- O-methyl-moracin N (4) and 29 moracin Z (5); the known moracin M (1), moracin N (2) and moracin P (6)], 8 phenolic 30 derivatives [the new (-)-epialboctalol (12), arachidin 4 (10) and the known alboctalol (11), 31 trans-resveratrol (7), arachidin 2 (9), trans-oxyresveratrol (8) and artogomezianol (13)], the 3 32 known flavonoids steppogenin (14), katuranin (15), dihydromorin (16), the β-sitosterol (17) 33 and the resorcinol (18). Comparison with literature data indicates that stilbenoids are 34 presumably responsible for the natural durability of the wood. In addition, chemical 35 composition points out that B. guianensis is closely related to Morus sp. in the phylogeny and 36 should be placed within the Moreae s. s. tribe in the Moraceae family. 37  38 Keywords: Bagassa guianensis, Moraceae, secondary metabolites, stilbenes, moracins, 39 flavonoids, natural durability 40  41 42 3   43 1. Introduction 44 Wood as a material is used extensively in construction and other applications where it can be 45 degraded by many different organisms, mainly fungi and insects. However, some trees have 46 specialized considerably long-lasting heartwoods. It has been demonstrated in the past that 47 wood natural durability can be ascribed to the presence of extractives (Smith et al., 1989; 48 Wang et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2007), although structural components of the cell wall may also 49 contribute to its resistance to biodegradation (Silva et al., 2007). Heartwood natural durability 50 can also result from synergetic or additive effects of compounds with various modes of action 51 (toxic, hydrophobic, free radical scavengers and so on) (Suttie and Orsler, 1996; Okitani et al., 52 1999; Schultz and Nicholas, 2000; Schultz et al. 2007; Binbuga et al., 2008). Future processes 53 to preserve wood constructions may involve returning to mankind’s historical use of naturally 54 durable heartwood as well as discovering eco-friendly wood protection agents inspired from 55 long-lasting woods (Schultz et al., 2007). 56  57 Bagassa guianensis Aubl. (Moraceae) commercially known as tatajuba is a large rather 58 infrequent unbuttressed canopy tree naturally occurring in French Guiana. Bagassa guianensis 59 is a member of Moraceae family, which is divided in 5 unequal tribes when comparing the 60 number of species in these tribes (Mabberley, 2002). Bagassa guianensis (the only member of 61 its genus) was originally classified in the Artocarpeae tribe, but Weiblen genoma-based 62 classifications have suggested recently that this species would better be included in Moreae 63 tribe (Datweyler and Weiblen, 2004; Zerega et al, 2005). 64  65 Species in the Moraceae family have important economic and medicinal value. They are 66 widely acknowledged as a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, 67 4  stilbenes, triterpenoids and xanthones (Lee et al., 2009; Ngadjui et al., 2005; Han et al., 2006; 68 Jayasinghe et al., 2008). Also, some of them like Maclura pomifera and B. guianensis are 69 capable of specializing very long-lasting woods (Scheffer and Morrell, 1998; Schultz et al., 70 1995), although in the latter case, the substances responsible for this high durability were 71 unknown. We therefore embarked upon identifying secondary metabolites of tatajuba wood 72 that may responsible for its natural durability. In addition, our secondary goal here was to 73 confirm (or refute) botanical classification of the Bagassa genus by chemotaxonomy. 74  75 2. Results and Discussion 76 The dried heartwood of Bagassa guianensis was extracted with ethyl acetate. This extract was 77 fractionated by silicagel column chromatography to give 9 fractions. Subsequent preparative 78 HPLC purifications of these fractions allowed us to isolate compounds 1-18 (figure 1). 79  80 Figure 1 Compounds 1-18 isolated from Bagassa guianensis (Moraceae). (a) New 81 compounds; (b) New names. 82  83 Compounds 1 to 6 shared several common spectral characteristics. The 1H and 13C NMR 84 spectral data (Table 1) indicate the presence of two independent aromatic systems with a 3,5-85 dihydroxyphenyl and a substituted benzofuran. For example, 3 exhibited the 3,5-86 dihydroxyphenyl with characteristic 1H spectrum composed of one doublet at  6.78 for H-87 2’/H-6’ and a triplet at  6.25 for H-4’. These protons are coupled to each other with a 4J 88 coupling of 2.1 Hz. In addition, 13C spectrum indicates the presence of two equivalent aryl 89 hydroxyl groups at  159.7. The 3,5-dihydroxyphenyl moiety was linked to C-2 by the 90 observation of a long range 1H-13C correlation between H-2’/H-6’ and C-2 at  156.5. The 91 second aromatic system appeared characteristic of a 6-monosubstituted benzofuran with 92 5  signals of protons H-4, H-5 and H-7 being a broad doublet at  7.43 (J = 8.5 Hz), a doublet of 93 doublet at  6.85 (J = 8.5 and 2.0 Hz) and a doublet at  7.09 (J = 2.0 Hz), respectively. On 94 the furan ring H-3 gives a doublet at  6.95 (J = 0.6 Hz) due to a long range 5J coupling with 95 H-7 (confirmed by the presence of crosspeak between H-3 and H-7 on COSY NMR 96 spectrum). When compared to moracin M (1), it became obvious from signal at  3.85 (3H, s) 97 and the presence of crosspeak at  56.2 in the 1H-13C HSQC spectra that compound 3 was a 98 moracin M methyl ether. The 1H-13C long-range HMBC spectra gave a crosspeak with C-6 at 99  159.6 unambiguously placing the methoxy group on C-6. HREIMS of 3 allowed us to 100 ascertain molecular formula C15H12O4 further confirming that we had isolated the new 6-O-101 methyl-moracin M (3). 102  103 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for moracins 3-5 in CD3OD 104  105 Compound 4 was isolated as yellowish amorphous powder. The HREIMS indicated a 106 molecular formula C20H20O4 deduced from the ion peack at m/z 325.1437 [M + H]+ (calcd 107 325.1434). The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 4 were closely related to those of moracin N 108 (2) (Lee et al., 2001) except for the replacement of hydroxyl group by a methoxy group as 109 described for the above compound 3. Indeed, the 1H NMR data of 4 (Table 1) demonstrated 110 the presence a methoxy group on C-6 in the benzofuran ring, with a signal at  3.88 (3H, s), a 111 crosspeak at  56.2 in the 1H-13C HSQC experiment and a crosspeak with C-6 at  157.4 in 112 the 1H-13C long-range HMBC spectra. This novel molecule was named 6-O-methyl-moracin 113 N. 114  115 6  Compound 5 was isolated as an amorphous brown powder. The molecular formula C20H22O5 116 was deduced from the HREIMS at m/z 343.1542 [M + H]+ (calcd 343.1540). The 1H- and 13C-117 NMR spectral data of 5 were closely related to those of 6-O-methyl-moracin N (4) (Table 1). 118 The main difference was observed in the prenyl moiety at C-5. The double bond is absent in 5 119 and it was unambiguously established that side chain at C-5 is hydrated and is therefore a 3-120 hydroxy-3-methylbutyl group, with the upfield shifts of methylene group H-1’’ from  3.34 to 121  2.73 and the apparition of a methylene H-2’’ at  1.74 in place of the vinyl proton at  5.52; 122 in addition, the two methyl groups H-4’’ and H-5’’ became equivalent at  1.27 (Table 1). 123 The 1H-13C long-range HMBC spectra exhibited a crosspeak between the methylene group H-124 1’’ and H-2’’ with C-5 at  128.6 proving the linkage C-1’’/C-5 between the 3-hydroxy-3-125 methylbutyl moiety and the benzofuran ring. This molecule is a hydrate of 6-O-methyl-126 moracin N and was named moracin Z. 127  128 Spectral data along with HREIMS of 1, 2 and 6 allowed us to determine and ascertain by 129 comparison with literature data that we had also isolated moracin M (1) (Basnet et al. 1993, 130 Zhou et al., 1999), moracin N (2) (Lee et al. 2001) and moracin P (6) (Dat et al., 2009). 131  132 Stilbenoids trans-resveratrol (7) (Lee et al. 2001; Su et al., 2002), trans-oxyresveratrol (8) 133 (Likhitwitayawuid and Sritularak, 2001; Lee et al., 2001; Su et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007), 134 arachidin 2 (9) (Orsini et al., 2004) and artogomezianol (13) (Likhitwitayawuid and 135 Sritularak, 2001) were identified by comparison of the respective spectral and chemical data 136 with those described in the literature (Figure 1). 137  138 Compound 10 was a colorless syrup with molecular formula C19H22O4 as deduced from the 139 HREIMS at m/z 315.1592 [M + H]+ (calcd 395.1591). The 1H spectral data of 10 were closely 140 7  related to those of arachidin 2 (9) (Table 2) and suggested a stilbenoid compound with a para-141 disubstituted aromatic ring A, a trans double bond between the aromatic rings, and a 142 1’,3’,4’,5’-tetrasubstituted aromatic ring B. Ring A is symmetrical, with 2 doublets at  7.32 143 (J = 8.7 Hz, H-2/H-6) and  6.75 (J = 8.7 Hz, H-3/H-5). The trans configuration of the double 144 bond can be ascertained by the very large coupling constant between the two protons at  6.90 145 (J = 16.5 Hz, H-) and  6.74 (J = 16.5 Hz, H-), and the B ring is symmetrical as well and 146 was characterized by a singlet at  6.46 (H-2’/H-6’). In the same way as we identified a 147 hydrated side chain in the moracins series, the main difference here between 9 and 10 is in the 148 side chain in position 4’, the double bond of which is also hydrated. This has been established 149 by the observation of methylene group H-1’’ at  2.66 instead of  3.28 and the apparition of 150 a second methylene H-2’’ at  1.68. In addition, the two methyl groups H-4’’ and H-5’’ 151 became equivalent at  1.25. The chromatography collected quantities was too low to observe 152 heteronuclear 1H-13C HSQC / HMBC correlations and direct 13C chemicals shifts by 153 13C/DEPTQ sequence. However, the above-described data in comparison with those of 154 arachidin 2 are sufficient to ascertain identification of compound 10 as trans-4’-(3-hydroxy-3-155 methylbutyl)-oxyresveratrol. We named this new compound arachidin 4. 156  157 Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for stilbenes 9 and 10 in CD3OD 158  159 Compounds 11 and 12 both isolated as brownish syrups presented the ion peak at m/z 160 489.1540 [M + H]+ in HREIMS indicating that they are isomers with molecular formulas 161 C28H24O8 (calcd 489.1544). The 1H-NMR allowed us to identify a 3,5-dihydroxyphenyl group 162 and two distinct 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl groups in both compounds. By comparison of the 163 respective spectral and chemical data with those described in the literature, compound 11 was 164 8  identified as alboctalol (Bates et al., 1997). Compound 12 has an []D20 value of -7.4° (c 165 0.004, CH3OH). It was clear that 12 was a diastereoisomer of 11 with equivalent H-18/H-22 166 protons at  6.01 (Table 3). In 11, H-18/H-22 pair gives a doublet at a strong upfield shift of  167 5.77 typical of the -stacking effect of the neighboring 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl groups. In 168 addition, on this aliphatic ring, the main differences with 11 are on methylene H-5 and 169 methines H-6, H-7 and H-8. H-5ax at  3.19 exhibited a broad triplet with large couplings (J = 170 13.7 Hz) with the gem H-5eq and the vicinal H-6 suggesting that the 6-aryl group should be 171 equatorial and proton H-6 axial. This observation was corroborated by the multiplicity of H-172 5eq signal at  2.72. This signal is a doublet of doublet with a large coupling constant J = 15.6 173 Hz with H-5ax and a small coupling constant J = 3.0 Hz with H-6ax. Signal of H-6ax at  3.51 174 is a broad triplet of doublet with two larges coupling constants J = 11.6 Hz with H-5ax and H-175 7 and a small coupling constant J = 2.1 Hz with H-5eq. This pattern indicates that the 7-aryl 176 group is equatorial and H-7 axial. H-7ax at  3.41 exhibited one doublet of doublet with one 177 large coupling constant (J = 11.3 Hz) with H-6ax and a second rather large coupling constant 178 (J = 8.2 Hz) with H-8 indicating that the 8-aryl group might be equatorial and proton H-8 179 axial. These assumptions were confirmed by NOESY experiment with cross peaks observed 180 between H-5eq and H-6ax, H-6ax and H-8ax, H-6ax and H-18, H-8ax and H-22 and between H-5ax 181 and H-16, H-7ax and H-16, H-7ax and H-28 (Figure 2). All data permitted to confirm that we 182 had isolated a new epimer of alboctalol (11) therefore named  (–)-epialboctalol (12). 183  184 Table 3 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data for distilbenes 11 and 12 in CD3OD 185  186 Figure 2 Pertinent NOE interactions observed for (–)-epialboctalol (12) from NOESY 187 experiment 188 9   189 In addition to these moracins and stilbenoids, we isolated flavanones steppogenin (14) (Lee et 190 al., 2001), katuranin (15) (Lee et al., 2001) and dihydromorin (16) (Su et al., 2002), together 191 with β-sitosterol (17) (Basnet et al., 2003, Aldrich Library of 13C and 1H FT NMR spectra, 192 1992) and resorcinol (18) (Aldrich Library of 13C and 1H FT NMR spectra, 1992). These 193 known compounds were identified by comparison of the respective spectral and chemical data 194 with those described in the literature. 195  196 Essentially three classes of compounds were isolated in this study: moracins, stilbenes and 197 flavanones. Only resorcinol 18 and -sitosterol 17 do not belong to these classes. These two 198 compounds are widely distributed in nature and cannot be viewed as chemotaxonomic 199 markers. 200  201 Moracin N, M and P have been isolated before from Morus alba. In general, it was found 202 from the literature that Morus genus is purveyor of moracins (Tagasuki et al., 1979; Hirakura 203 et al., 1986; Basnet et al., 1993; Nguyen et al., 2009). The only one exception is the isolation 204 of moracin M from Artocarpus dadah (Su et al., 2002). 205  206 Among stilbenes, trans-oxyresveratrol was isolated from various plants including Morus sp. 207 and Artocarpus sp. (Hirakura et al, 1986; Su et al, 2002; Shimizu et al., 1998; Song et al, 208 2009). Trans-resveratrol was isolated from many sources including the Moraceae Cudrania 209 javanensis classified today as Maclura cochinchinensis (Murti et al., 1972, Chapman & Hall, 210 2006). The distylbene artogomezianol 13 is a constituent of Artocarpus gomezianus roots and 211 albolactol 11 was isolated from heartwood of Morus alba (Likhitwitayawuid and Sritularak 212 2001, Ferlinahayati et al., 2008). 213 10   214 Regarding flavonoids, it has been described that many Moraceae can produce steppogenin 215 (El-Sohly et al, 1999; Su et al, 2002; Sheu et al., 2005). Katuranin was also isolated from 216 various biological sources in Morus and Maclura genera (El-sohly et al., 1999, Lee at al., 217 2009) and dihydromorin was isolated from Morus, Artocarpus, and Maclura genera (Shimizy 218 et al., 1998, El-Sohly et al, 1999, Su et al., 2002). 219  220 It has been hypothesized before that stilbenes are the major types of compounds isolated from 221 Moraceae and may be useful chemotaxonomic markers (Rowe and Conner, 1979). Also, 222 Schultz has shown that stilbenoids play an important role in the high natural durability of 223 Maclura pomifera wood (Schultz et al., 1990). Stilbenes are known as fungicide, termicides 224 and bactericide (Hart and Shrimpton, 1979; Likhitwitayawui and Sritularak, 2001; Javasinghe 225 et al., 2004), and may also exhibit antioxidant properties (Dani et al., 2008; Iacopini et al., 226 2008; Luo et al., 2005). If it is reasonable to believe that stilbenes are responsible for Bagassa 227 guianensis heartwood natural durability based on literature precedents, stilbenes can be 228 considered as a secondary chemotaxonomic marker here indicating that Bagassa is related to 229 Morus, Artocarpus, and Maclura genera. In Weiblen classification, Artocarpus belongs to the 230 Artocarpeae tribe and Maclura belongs to the Moreae sensu largo tribe, and both Moreae and 231 Artocarpeae tribes are rather closely related genetically. 232 The peculiarity of B. guianensis in comparison with other Moraceae is the very high 233 proportion of moracins. In this matter, it can be hypothesized that Bagassa genus is closely 234 related to Morus and that moracins are specific to these two genera. These findings are in 235 agreement with Weiblen genetic-based classification where both Bagassa and Morus belong 236 to the Moreae sensu stricto tribe. It should be mentioned that the Sorocea genus, which also 237 belongs to the Moreae s. s. tribe, has been investigated before in the literature and apparently 238 11  does not contain moracins (see for example Ferrari et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2008). This 239 observation speaks in favor of a very close relationship between Bagassa and Morus. 240  241 3. Concluding remarks 242 Studies of defensive wood chemicals in Bagassa guianensis allowed us to identify large 243 amount of diversely functionalized stilbenes presumably responsible for wood natural 244 durability. In addition, it was found based on the presence of moracins that Bagassa is very 245 closely related to Morus genus, therefore corroborating Weiblen phylogenetic classification 246 where B. guianensis belongs to the Moreae s. s. tribe rather than to the Artocarpeae tribe. 247  248 4. Experimental 249 4.1 General experimental procedure 250 The 1H and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX500 spectrometer (1H-251 500.13 MHz) equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance inverse Cryoprobe TXI (1H-13C-15N), 252 with z gradient. Spectra were recorded with 1.7 mm NMR capillary tube in 40 µL of 99.99% 253 CD3OD solvent (δ1H 3.31 ppm - δ13C 49.00 ppm) at 300 K. The 1H (500 MHz) and 13C NMR 254 (125 MHz) data are reported in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants are 255 in Hz and s stands for singlet, d for doublet, t for triplet, q for quartet, m for multiplet and br 256 for broad. Hydrogen connectivity (C, CH, CH2, CH3) information was obtained from edited 257 HSQC and/or DEPTQ-135 experiments. Proton and carbon peak assignments were based on 258 2D NMR analyses (COSY, NOESY, HSQC and HMBC). HREI-MS were performed using a 259 QStar Elite mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada) equipped 260 with an ESI source operated in the positive ion mode. The capillary voltage was set at 5,500 261 V, the cone voltage at 20 V and air was used as the nebulizing gas (20 psi). In this hybrid 262 instrument, ions were measured using an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oa-TOF) 263 12  mass analyzer. Analyst software version 2.1 was used for instrument control, data acquisition 264 and data processing. The accurate mass measurements were performed in triplicate with two 265 internal calibrations. Direct sample introduction was performed at a 5 µL/min flow rate using 266 a syringe pump. The UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 5 267 spectrophotometer . Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter 268 equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and a 1 dm cell. The HPLC separations were 269 performed on a Supelco Discovery® HS PEG column (250 × 21.1 mm, 5 µm) using a Waters 270 system equipped with a W600 pump and a W2996 photodiode array absorbance detector. The 271 samples were injected manually through a Rheodyne injector and the flow rate was 15 272 mL.min-1. Silica gel 60 (35-70 µm) and analytical TLC plates (Si gel 60 F 254) were 273 purchased from SDS (France). All other chemicals and solvents were analytical grade and 274 purchased from SDS (France). 275 4.2 Plant Material 276 Bagassa guianensis was collected in Régina, French Guiana. A voucher specimen is kept at 277 the herbarium of Cayenne (CAY-RA13), French Guiana. 278 4.3 Extraction and isolation 279 The dried powdered heartwood of Bagassa guianensis (140 g) was extracted with ethyl 280 acetate (3 × 500 mL) at room temperature to give a crude extract which was fractionated first 281 on a silica gel column chromatography with polarity gradient of hexane/ethyl acetate 282 mixtures: 80/20; 50/50; 20/80; 0/100. 9 fractions numbered F1 to F9 were obtained. Fractions 283 F1 to F5 were purified on HPLC with a linear gradient of hexane/isopropanol, by the 284 following method: 70:30 changing over 2 min to 60:40, then to 40:60 at 10 min and pure 285 isopropanol at 15 min and remaining as is for 5 min. The fractions F6 and F9 were analyzed 286 and purified with an isocratic method: 30:70 hexane/isopropanol. These methods allowed us 287 to isolate moracin M 1 (6.2 mg; w/w 0.019%), moracin N 2 (6.7 mg; w/w 0.020%), 6-O-288 13  methyl-moracin M 3 (3.3 mg; w/w 0.010%), 6-O-methyl-moracin-N 4 (9.1 mg; w/w 0.027%), 289 moracin Z 5 (5.2 mg; w/w 0.016%), moracin P 6 (1.2 mg; w/w 0.003), trans-resveratrol 7 290 (12.6 mg; w/w 0.038%), trans-oxyresveratrol 8 (112.3 mg; w/w 0.343%), arachidin 2 9 (5.1 291 mg; w/w 0.015%), arachidin 4 10 (0.4 mg; w/w 0.001%), alboctalol 11 (0.5 mg; w/w 292 0.001%), (–)-epialboctalol 12 (5.4 mg; w/w 0.016%), artogomezianol 13 (12.7 mg; w/w 293 0.038%), steppogenin 14 (11.5 mg; w/w 0.035%), katuranin 15 (1.5 mg; w/w 0.004%), 294 dihydromorin 16 (20.4 mg; w/w 0.062%), the β-sitosterol 17 (8.4 mg; w/w 0.025%) and the 295 resorcinol 18 (1.8 mg; w/w 0.005%).
