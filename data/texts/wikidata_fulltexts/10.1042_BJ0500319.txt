The Accumulation and Utilization of Asperuloside in the Rubiaceae
BY A. R. TRIM
Biochemical Laboratory, Univer8ity of Cambridge
(Received 14 February 1951)
The significance of glycosides in plant metabolism is
obscure, and the present work has been undertaken
as a contribution to its elucidation. Large amounts
of glycosides are present in many plant cells and
although these substances vary widely in their
chemical constitution many of them exhibit a
common pattern of distribution in the plant. They
are accumulated in the vacuoles of young parts
of plants during the period of cell expansion, and
afterwards may be partly or completely removed as
the part ages.
The plants investigated were: Galium aparine
(cleavers, or goose-grass), Asperula odorata (wood-
ruff) and Rubia tinctorum (dyer's madder), which
belong to the tribe Stellatae ofthe family Rubiaceae.
Most plants produce glycosides of a number of
aglycone types, and the Stellatae are known to
produce anthocyanins and related glycosides, which
are universal among higher plants, anthraquinone
glycosides, coumarin glycosides and asperuloside,
which probably has a substituted furan structure
(Trim & Hill, 1952).
Asperuloside was chosen for study because it
occurs in very large quantities in the plants investi-
gated, and because its chromogenic properties
provide very simple means for its detection and
estimation.
EXPERIMENTAL
The methods of growing and collecting the different plant
materials will be described with the experiments in which
they were used. The time of collecting was mid-morning.
Extracts were made from fresh, weighed material unless
otherwise stated. Dry weights were determined after drying
equivalent batches of the material for several days at 370
and then over concentrated H2SO4 and solidNaOH in vacuo.
The parts to be extracted were ground with an equal weight
of 0-1x-HOl and a little sand. A few drops of CHC13 were
added and the mush allowed to stand for about 15 min. The
ground tissues were then mixed with kieselguhr, filtered on
a Buchner funnel and washed with water until the runnings
were free from asperuloside. The extract was made up to an
appropriate volume with water, neutralized with CaCO3 and
filtered.
Estimation of a8peruloside. 1 ml. samples of the extracts
were mixed with 11 ml. ofreagentA (Trim & Hill, 1952) and
heated on a boiling-water bath for 5 min. with occasional
shaking. The characteristic blue derivative of asperuloside
developed. Thecooled solutionwascomparedwitha standard
in a Duboscq-type visual colorimeter. Beer's Law applies
over a wide range of concentrations as may be seen in
Table 1. The effect of the addition of a plant extract is

shown in Table 2. The colour developed under these condi-.
tions has an absorption spectrum with bands at 645 and
600 m,. Early in the season, when most parts of the plants
were young, very little extraneous colour was developed.
Later, when the bulk of the tissues were older, the plants
produced sufficient quantities of interfering substances to
necessitate the use of a red ifiter when making the colori-
metric measurements. The nature of the interference by
substances such as phenols, ketoses and heterocyclic N
compounds, which are likely to occur in plants, has been
A. R. TRIM
described (Trim & Hill, 1952). Since relatively large pro.
portions of these substances must be added to cause a
marked effect, the interference was rarely serious.
Reagent A was also used for the detection of asperuloside
in portions of plant tissues. The blue colour develops in
sections and fragments of plant heated with reagent A on a
slide or in a test tube. This procedure was used to detect the
localization of asperuloside.
Galium aparine
The material was collected at random from one
large plot of plants. Ripe seeds were collected from
the plot at the end of the season 1946 and used for
experiments during the following winter and spring.
Seeds and seedlings. Batches of 30 newly ripened
seeds were analysed and found to contain 3-5%
asperuloside on a dry-weight basis. After storing
until the following spring the value had fallen to
2 5% and the seeds remained viable. Qualitative
tests on sections which had been cut from seeds
soaked in water for 16 hr. showed that the endo-
sperm and the whole of the embryo contained
asperuloside. As germination proceeds the endo-
sperm shrinks and the amount of asperuloside in it
declines. The embryo develops at the expense of the
endosperm. Asperuloside was found in all parts of
the developing embryo and was in particularly high
concentrations in the early embryonic hypocotyl
and cotyledons. These parts gave a purple colour
with reagent A, which suggested the presence of
a large proportion of the interfering substances
mentioned above. The interfering material dis-
appeared during the development of the seedling.
As the seedlings grew they were dissected into their
parts and each part was tested separately. This
confirmed the observation that asperuloside occurs
in all parts ofthe very young seedling and that there
is a high concentration in the cotyledons. The
glycoside appears to be absent from the growing tips
of the roots.
The following measurements show how asperulo-
side accumulates during the period of germination.
Two batches of about 500 seeds were sown on wet
sand in two shallow dishes covered with sheets of
glass, slightly raised above the tops of the dishes to
admit air. Both dishes were kept in a greenhouse at
180 and one of them was covered to exclude light.
At intervals two samples of 30 seeds were removed
from each dish and ground with sand and a few
ml. 3 % HCI to extract the asperuloside. This was
estimated, and the values obtained are plotted in
Fig. 1. The initial fall in the amount of asperuloside
per individual takes place while the sprouting
radicle has still not emerged through the seed coat.
By the time the m-imum has been reached
sprouting is just visible among the seeds which have
been kept in the dark. These seedlings then accumu-
late asperuloside until the amount per individual
reaches the level in the ungerminated seed, and if
the seedlings are kept dark this level is maintained
for many days. By the time the maximum has been
reached the plant has fully emerged. Exposure of
these seedlings to the light results in an immediate
marked increase of asperuloside, due presumably to
photosynthesis. The sprouting of the seedlings
grown in the light is retarded by about 8 days and
theaccumulation ofasperuloside is slower, butbythe
time the cotyledons appear the amount of asperulo-
side has reached the level of the maximum for
seedlings grown in the dark. There is then a rapid
increase in the amount of asperuloside due to the
supervention of photosynthesis.

This experiment was repeated a month later and
the same changes were observed. The amount of
asperuloside in the seedlings germinated in the
dark reached 0-34 mg. per plant after 12 days and
remained constant for another 10 days. Then it fell
off slowly, reaching 0-26 mg. per plant 32 days from
the initiation of germination. Some of the seedlings
germinated in the dark were exposed to the light
18 days after the beginning of the experiment and
immediately began to produce more asperuloside.
After 2 days' exposure there was 0-4 mg. per plant
and after 15 days 0 59 mg. per plant.
It is concluded from these experiments that
asperuloside is continuously accumulated by the
germinating embryo in the absence of external
nutrients other than water, the initial rapid fall in
the amount of glycoside being due to the utilization
of the endosperm. This accumulation is terminated
abruptly at a certain level unless photosynthesis is
permitted. The effect of feeding through the roots
was not tested.

Asperuloside formation in seedlings grown in soil.
Twelve 25 cm. pots of soil were each sown with
40 seeds of G. aparine and kept in a greenhouse at
180. After a month, when the seedlings were well
developed, they were carefully removed from two
of the pots, washed, counted and each plant divided
into four parts: roots, hypocotyl, cotyledons and
shoots. The parts from one pot were weighed and the
asperuloside was extracted. The parts from the
other pot were used for the determination of the
dry weights. Further samples were taken as the
seedlings developed. Some of the results are plotted
in Fig. 2.

The seasonal variation of the amounts of asperulo-

same stage of growth varied considerably in their
asperuloside content. It was found that significant
values for comparative purposes could be obtained
by analysing batches of six or more shoots picked at
random from the experimental plot. The values for
six batches of six shoots picked at the same time are
tabulated in Table 4.

G. aparine grown in soil with normal lighting; (A) leaves,
(B) roots, (C) cotyledons, (D) hypocotyl.
As the plant develops there is continuous steady
accumulation ofasperuloside in the roots and shoots.
At the same time, the amount in the cotyledons falls
to a constant low level. While there is a possibility of
transport of glycoside from the organs which are
losing it to those which are gaining it, at least part
of it is synthesized anew and accumulates in the
growing parts, for the amount of glycoside which is
gained by the roots and shoots separately is greater
than the sum of the amounts lost by the hypocotyl
and cotyledons over the period of the experiment.
Figures for dry weights (Table 3) show that in the
course of this experiment the cotyledons and

The formation of the glycoside throughout the
seasonwas followed. Batches of20 shootswere taken
for as long as the rapidly increasing size ofthe shoots
permitted. After that the number was reduced. The
amount of glycoside per shoot gradually rises and
then falls sharply as the shoot becomes senescent.
When different parts of the shoot were tested with
reagentA it was found that asperuloside is present in
large amounts in all parts of the very young leaf,
with the possible exception of the epidermis and
chlorenchyma. There is much less in old leaves and
what they do contain is confined to the vascular
tissues, showing that the decline, already observed
in the ageing hypocotyl and cotyledons, also occurs
in the leaves.
The manner in which the glycoside content of the
plant changes with age was shown more clearly by
the following experiments with growing shoots,
which were cut up into successive nodes, defined as
follows. The leaves grow in whorls about the nodes.
Each node and the internode above it develop
together so that their parts have the same average
age and may be taken as a unit composed of tissues
of approximately the same age. Dry weights were
determined on material from a similar shoot from

the same plant and a corresponding node. The
results in Fig. 3 show that where rapid, exponential
growth is taking place there is a high, constant con-
centration of asperuloside; after exponential growth
has ceased there is a sharp downward trend in
asperuloside concentration towards a lower, slowly
drifting level.

Node number
Fig. 3. The concentration of asperuloside in successive
nodes of a shoot of G. aparine. Node 1 is the most apical.
The black columns indicate the relative dry weights ofthe
nodes.
If the change in asperuloside concentration is
considered in relation to the development of an
individual mesophyll cell the change from the pre-
dominance of accumulation to the predominance of
utilization (or transport away from the leaf)
appears to be sharp and to coincide with the end of
vacuolation and cell expansion. In this case (and all
the others described in this paper) the change does
not occur in a particular node, say 3 or 4, counting
from the apex of the shoot downwards, but appears
to be at a hypothetical point betweennode 3 and 4 (in
this case). This is probably to be explained by the
fact that all the cells in a particular node are not at
the same stage of development. In this case all the
cells in node 4 have passed through the stage of
exponential growth; but while some of those in
node 3 have also passed through that stage many of
them are still in it. In this situation it is logical to
expect the asperuloside concentration in node 3 to
be on the higher level, although growth has already
begun to slow down.
It seemed that during the stage of exponential
growth the accumulation of asperuloside was
directly proportional to the increase in dry matter.
This was tested by estimation of asperuloside in
shoots of G. aparine over a period of 2 weeks. The
shoots were chosen so that the whole of the tissues
were well within the stage of exponential growth.
They were picked at random from the experimental
plot and divided into three batches of 30.
Asperuloside was estimated in two batches and
the third was used for dry-weight determinations.
The results in Table 5 show that over a period during
which the bulk of the average shoot increased nearly
threefold the amount of asperuloside remained
directly proportional to the fresh and dry weights.
Accumulation of a&peruloside in the fruit. The
accumulation of the glycoside during the period of
the swelling of the fruit was also observed. Fruit
was collected at three successive stages. As is
shown in Table 6, the amount of glucoside is
approximately proportional to the dry weight.

plant. In this case the initial concentration of
glycoside in the young leaves was much higher
(10-15 % of the dry weight) than in Galium aparine.
Figures for successive whorls of leaves, numbered
from the apex ofthe shoot downwards, are tabulated
in Table 7. The length of the accompanying inter-
node is given as an additional index of the stage of
growth.
The values for the asperuloside concentration
in successive internodes of a developing shoot,
numbered from the apex downwards, are recorded
in Fig. 4. The arrow in this figure marks the ninth
internode below which the asperuloside concentra-
tion rises. Comparison of these intemodes with
higher ones is scarcely permissible, since they had
begun to develop characteristics of the subter-
ranean parts of the plant. This was indicated by the
growth of adventitious rootlets from some of the
nodes and the appearance of anthraquinone glyco-
sides, which are characteristic of the roots and
underground stems of Rubia. The observations in
the following section relate to the form of the curve
in Fig. 4.
Asperuloside in the vascular tissues of the stem.
A fully developed internode of R. tinctorum was
divided into three parts: cortex, inner bark or
phloem and xylem combined with pith. Tests
showed that there is scarcely any asperuloside in the
cortex and woody regions, but there is a very high
concentration in the phloem. Fresh strips of the
latter were weighed rapidly on a torsion balance,
dropped into a known volume of reagent A and the
asperuloside estimated. Other strips were taken for
dry-weight estimations. More than 20% of the dry
matter was found to be asperuloside. The values are
recorded in Table 8. If younger, still growing inter-
nodes are tested much asperuloside is found in the
cortex and pith.
Asperula odorata
The pattern of distribution of asperuloside in
A. odorata was found to be very similar to that in the
two plants already described. An experiment with
this plant was devised to confirm the observations
already made. It was arranged to cover the period
of flowering to see if the development of the in-
florescence is accompanied by asperuloside accumu-
lation. The experiment was started when it was just
possible to separate the developing flower buds
from the shoot and continued until the flowers were
just beginning to die. Sixty shoots were picked at
random from one large clone at intervals of 3 days
over a period of 4 weeks. These batches were divided
into two equal parts and the nodes of each- part

separated. The leaves were separated from the
stems and the inflorescence was counted as one node,
number 1. The parts from one batch of 30 shoots
were used for dry-weight determinations and those
from the second for asperuloside determinations.
In this way it was possible to follow the course of
asperuloside accumulation and disappearance in
each unit. The results recorded in Figs. 5a and b

cells appears to be as follows: after the primary
meristematic stage, the cells enter the period of
exponential growth, during which the glycoside
accumulates in amounts directly proportional to the
increase in dry matter. This may be the result of
simple storage of the product but may equally be
due to the accumulation of glycoside, resulting from
the balance between opposed processes of synthesis

show that the parts of A. odorata accumulate and
utilize asperuloside according to the same develop-
mental pattern as the two plants already investi-
gated. In the inflorescence the glycoside level re-
mains high throughout the experiment. However,
this was the only part which continued to form new
elements, thus compensating for the loss ofglycoside
in the senescent elements.
DISCUSSION
While the study of individual cells has not been
possible in this work, it appears that many of them
accumulate asperuloside during an early stage of
their existence. In this respect the history of such
and removal, in which there is a preponderance of
synthesis over removal. The disappearance of the
glycoside could occur by further metabolism at or
near to the site of formation, by translocation, or by
a combination of both processes. At the end of
exponential growth of the cells increase in volume
virtually ceases and a decline in glycoside accumula-
tion sets in, so that finally the cells become devoid
of it. This change would be explained either by a
cessation of synthesis or by a decline of synthesis
sufficient to be completely overbalanced by a
continued steady removal of glycoside, or by an
increased rate of removal. Whatever the explana-
tion, the cessation of growth is accompanied by an
abrupt change in glycoside metabolism.
324 I952
ASPERULOSIDE
The chlorenchyma may not accumulate asper-
uloside and the epidermal cells also appear to be
exceptional in that very few, if any of them,
accumulate the glycoside. Since the methods em-
ployed were crude these conclusions are only
tentative. In all organs part of the vascular system
appears to be exceptional in continuing to accumu-
late asperuloside until the organ becomes moribund.
The technique available did not permit a distinction
between individual cells, but it is certain that this
phenomenon is confined to the inner bark, that is, to
the phloem and cambium. But this is a region of
continued growth, containing young cells which
would be expected to contain the maximum amount
ofasperuloside. Consequently, it might be suggested
that the exceptional behaviour of these parts, in
respect of asperuloside accumulation, is more
apparent than real. However, it should be added
that the amounts of asperuloside found in the inner
bark were in excess of what might have been ex-
pected if it were composed entirely of very young
cells, which is not the case. In addition, it has to be
remembered that the phloem is the main path of
transport for organic material, so that the large
amounts of asperuloside found there may be in
process of transport.
As far as the author is aware this is the fullest
investigation of its kind. But there are many other
recorded observations which support the view that
the distribution of asperuloside in the rubiaceous
plant is typical of the distribution of glycosides and
many other metabolites throughout the whole
range of higher plants. It is frequently stated in the
literature that young, actively growing parts of a
particular plant are the most abundant source of
some of its characteristic products. The young
shoots of many plants are pigmented by antho-
cyanins in the developing epidermal cells, and the
pigmentation often disappears after these cells have
become fully grown. In his observations on the
living rose leaf, Guilliermond (1913) showed that
anthocyanins accumulate in the developing vacuoles
of the young epidermal cells, and thus provide a
visible parallel to the first stage of the process which
has been postulated to explain the present observa-
tions on asperuloside. Hurry (1930) showed that the
largest amount of the indigo-producing glycoside of
I8atis tinctoria is present in the very young leaves
and that the older leaves contain much less. The
classical work ofTreub (1896, 1904, 1907) on cyano-
genesis in Pangium edule and other plants provides
further examples of the same developmental
process.
Certain exceptional cases have been observed.
Bourquelot & Danjou (1905), and others, have
shown that sambunigrin, D-mandelonitrile gluco-
side, which occurs in the elder, Sambucus nigra,
remains in the leaves even after they have fallen.
Treub (1904) noticed the same phenomenon with the
cyanogenetic glycoside of Indigofera galegoides.
There is a suggestion in such cases that the appro-
priate hydrolysing enzyme is absent, but it has yet
to be shown that such phenomena are not also
dependent upon the absence of all of a number of
different modes of utilization of the glycoside con-
cerned. At the other extreme, Treub (1904) found
that in Pha8eolus lunatus there is a marked diurnal
variation in the amount of cyanogenetic glycoside
stored in the leaves.
The balance of evidence clearly favours the view
that glycosides are rapidly synthesized and broken
down in the plant and that in some cases at least
large amounts of glycoside are involved. The
characteristic distribution of these substances in the
plant is related chiefly to different metabolic stages
in its development. If, as it seems, glycosides enter
into the metabolic processes of plants, they cannot
be regarded as mere end products of metabolism,
and it is important to determine the reactions in
which they participate.
SUMMARY
1. The accumulation and utilization of asperulo-
side in the tissues of three rubiaceous plants have
been studied.
2. The glycoside accumulates in young tissues
such asnew leaves in the stage ofexponential growth
and cells in the neighbourhood of the cambium.
3. The accumulation stops abruptly with the
completion of the stage ofexponential growth and is
followed by a period of glycoside depletion, which
may involve translocation to another part of the
plant.
4. Nearly all the cells in the plant, with the
possible exception of most of those in the epidermis
and chlorenchyma of the aerial parts and some of
those in the roots, appear to accumulate asperuloside
when in the early stage of growth.
5. The significance of these results in relation to
metabolism and translocation is discussed.
6. The general pattern of production and utiliza-
tion of asperuloside appears to be characteristic of
many glycosides and other metabolic products
throughout the higher plants.

A Modified Medium for Lactobacillus casei for the Assay of B Vitamins

(Received 9 March 1951)
Snell & Wright (1941) were the first to point out
that their method for the assay of nicotinic acid
could be applied to the determination of biotin and
pantothenic acid. Shortly afterwards, Landy &
Dicken (1942) published a general procedure for the
estimation of six vitamins, using Lactobacillus caaei
as the test organism. Roberts & Snell (1946)
devised a medium for microbiological assays with
L. ca8ei, which was an improvement on the original
medium of Landy & Dicken (1942).
On investigating the various factors affecting the
growth of L. ca8ei, we have modified the medium of
Teply & Elvehjem (1945) with the aim ofdeveloping
a suitable medium which could be used for assays of
various vitamins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Stock 8OlUtiOfl8
Unless otherwise mentioned, the stock solutions were pre-
pared according to techniques described by Snell (1950).
Salt 8olution E (Kodicek & Pepper, 1948a).
MgSO4. 7H20, 60 g.; FeSO4. 7H20, 4 mg.;
MnSO4.4H20, 1-5 g.; CuSO4 .5H20, 4 mg.;
NaCl, 0-5 g.; ZnSO4. 7H20, 4 mg.
were dissolved in 250 ml. of water and 3 drops of conc. HCI
added.
Ca8einhydroly8ate:H2$O4-hydroly8ed,vitamin-free'Labco'
ca8ein. 'Labco' casein (200 g.) with 1 1. 25% (w/w) H2S04,
was autoclaved for 15 hr., at 15 lb. pressure. A litre of
water was added, sulphate precipitated with about 850 g.
Ba(OH)2, the mixture autoclaved for 10 min. at 10 lb.
pressure, and filtered hot through a Buchner funnel. The
BaSO4 cake was thoroughly broken up in 1 1. water, auto-
claved and filtered hot. The precipitate was washed once
more as before. The combined filtrates were heated and the
excess barium was carefully precipitated with 25% H2504.
The suspensionwas filtered hot, andthe filtrate concentrated
onawater bath to about 2500 ml. Dryweight determination
gave a recovery of a little over 90 %.
The hydrolysate at pH 6-0 was stirred for 1 hr. with
100 g. Norite charcoal (British Drug Houses Ltd.), filtered
and the pH adjusted to 3-8 with glacial acetic acid. The
charcoal treatment was repeated, the solution filtered and
broughttopH 6 8-7-0 with40% KOH. The hydrolysate was
finally treated with Norite, 40 g., for 1 hr. The residue from
each ifitration was washed with 50-100 ml. of water and the
washings added to the filtrate. The filtrate was concentrated
on a water bath to contain 10% (wfv) casein solids. Re-
covery was 73% (casein solids). Before use, new batches of
hydrolysate were always tested at several levels and the
optimum concentration determined. An amount of 50 mg./
10 ml. medium was usually found adequate. We have found
it necessary to restandardize the adsorption treatment when
a different brand of charcoal was used.
Peptone treated with Norite charcoal. 'Difco' bacto-
peptone (1O g.) was dissolved in about 80 ml. water, pH
adjusted to 3 0 with HCI and made up to 100 ml. The
solution was stirredwith 5 g. Norite for 1 hr., ffltered, andthe
charcoal treatment repeated twice with 2 g. Norite.
Pteroylglutamic acid (PGA). During the early part of the
work 'Folvite' (Lederle Laboratories) was used as the PGA
standard. Later, when a 97% pure and aldehyde-free pre-
paration (Lederle Laboratories) became available it was
used instead.
A stock solution of PGA containing 100,ug./ml. was
prepared in 1% K2HPO4. It was renewed twice weekly.
From the stock solution weaker standards were prepared for
immediate use.
Bacteriological procedure
The double-strength medium, 5 ml., the composition of
which is shown in Table 1, was diluted to 10 ml. with distilled
water after adding the test solutions. The test substances
were assayed usually in triplicate at each level. The tubes
were placed in Petri dish canisters and autoclaved for 6 min.
at 15 lb. pressure. Autoclavingfora longer period resulted in
caramelization and consequent deterioration ofthe medium.
On autoclaving, a slight precipitate resulted, but this re-
dissolved on shaking at room temperature.
Stock culture. Cultures ofL. casei, A.T.C.C. no. 7469, with
characteristics reported by Kodicek & Pepper (1948b) were
maintained on slopes of' Difco' yeast-dextrose-agar supple-
mented with 'Hepamino' liver powder (Evans) 1% and
glucose 0.5%. They were subcultured every 2-3 weeks.
Each subculture consisted of two transfers from liquid to
