Os óleos essenciais das folhas e das cascas do tronco de Drimys brasiliensis Miers 
(Winteraceae) foram obtidos individualmente por hidrodestilação e suas composições químicas 
foram determinadas através de análise por CG/DIC e CG/EM. Os principais constituintes 
identificados foram monoterpenos (folhas 4,31% e cascas do tronco 90,02%) e sesquiterpenos 
(folhas 52,31% e cascas do tronco 6,35%). Adicionalmente, o sesquiterpeno poligodial foi isolado 
do extrato em hexano das cascas do tronco de D. brasiliensis após fracionamento cromatográfico 
e caracterizado por métodos espectroscópicos. Visando a avaliação do potencial anti-inflamatório, 
os óleos essenciais brutos e o sesquiterpeno poligodial foram submetidos à bioensaios para 
avaliação da toxicidade aguda destes compostos bem como das atividades anti-inflamatória e 
antinociceptiva induzidas por carragenina e formalina em ratos. Nossos resultados mostraram que 
o óleo essencial bruto obtido das cascas do tronco reduziu significativamente o edema induzido 
por carragenina. O efeito anti-inflamatório induzido pelo óleo das cascas do tronco (a 200 mg kg-1) 
foi similar ao observado para indometacina (a 10 mg kg-1) e superior ao poligodial (a 200 mg kg-1) 
em 30 e em 60 min após administração. A resposta inflamatória induzida pela formalina foi 
efetiva para o óleo das cascas do tronco (62,5%) em comparação ao poligodial (50,0%).
The essential oils from leaves and stem barks from Drimys brasiliensis Miers (Winteraceae) 
were individually obtained by hydrodistillation and their compounds characterized by use of  
GC/FID and GC/MS. The main identified derivatives were monoterpenes (leaves 4.31% and 
stem barks 90.02%) and sesquiterpenes (leaves 52.31% and stem barks 6.35%). Additionally, 
the sesquiterpene polygodial was isolated from hexane extract from stem barks of D. brasiliensis 
after chromatographic steps and characterized by spectroscopic means, mainly NMR. Aiming 
the evaluation of anti-inflammatory potential, the crude essential oils and the sesquiterpene 
polygodial were subjected to bioassays to evaluate the acute toxicity of these compounds as well 
as the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities induced by carrageenan and formalin in 
mices. Ours results showed that essential oil obtained from the stem barks significantly reduced 
the oedema induced by carrageenan. The anti-inflammatory effect induced by stem barks oil (at 
200 mg kg-1) was similar to observed for indomethacin (at 10 mg kg-1) and superior for polygodial 
(at 200 mg kg-1) in 30 and 60 min after the administration of essential oils. The inflammatory 
response induced by formalin was effective to the stem barks oil (62.5%) in comparison to 
polygodial (50.0%).

Introduction
Drimys brasiliensis Miers belongs to Winteraceae 
family, whose occurrence is restrict to South America. This 
species is known in Brazil with a vernacular name “casca-
d’anta” and has been used in folk medicine as analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory.1 
In the chemical point of view, several species of Drimys 
have been shown to contain sesquiterpenes of drimane 
skeleton, which possess a variety of biological potential 
Lago et al. 1761Vol. 21, No. 9, 2010
including antibacterial,2 anti-inflammatory,3 anti-allergic,3 
antifungal,4-6 antinociceptive,7-9 anti-hyperalgesic,10 and 
antibacterial.11 Nevertheless, there are only two works about 
the chemical composition of D. brasiliensis, in which the 
same type of drimane sesquiterpenes have been found, such 
as confertifolin, drimanial, valdiviolide, polygodial, 1-b-(p-
methoxycinnamoyl)polygodial and 1-b-(p-cumaroyloxy)
polygodial.6,12 The chemical composition of the essential oils 
from D. brasiliensis from Southern Brazil in different periods 
of collection has recently been described in the literature,13 
in which the predominance of monoterpenes was observed 
in the leaves (fresh and dried) oils while the sesquiterpenes 
were the main derivatives in the stem bark and unripe fruits 
oils. Additionally, the both oils showed great amounts 
of cyclocolorenone, an unusual ketone-aromadendrane 
derivative, whose occurrence showed to be independent of 
the season in which the samples were collected. Despite 
of the use of infusions of bark from D. brasiliensis to the 
treatment of pain and ulcer,8 only the larvicidal potential of 
the volatiles against cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) 
microplus and the brown dog tick R. sanguineus have been 
evaluated, which showed lethality in low concentrations.14
Therefore, in the course of our studies with 
pharmacologically active volatiles from Brazilian highland 
regions,15 we report here the chemical composition of the 
essential oils from leaves and stem barks from D. brasiliensis 
Miers (Winteraceae) as well as the evaluation of their 
anti-inflammatory potentials. Additionally, the biological 
activities of the crude oils were compared to that evaluated to 
sesquiterpene polygodial, which is the main constituent from 
the stem bark of Drimys species and responsible from the 
pharmacological effects for the extracts prepared from these 
plants.3,7,16,17 However, the potential observed to the analyzed 
oils could contribute to explain the popular use of bark infusion 
of D. brasiliensis to the pain treatment, since the components 
of the essential oils also showed anti-inflammatory effects. 
Experimental
Plant material
Leaves and stem barks from Drimys brasiliensis Miers 
were collected in Umuarama district, Campos do Jordão, 
São Paulo, SP, in August 2006. Voucher specimen had been 
deposited at Herbarium of Prefeitura Municipal de São 
Paulo (PMSP) under number PMSP8984.
Extraction of the essential oils
Fresh leaves (115 g) and stem bark (902 g) 
from D. brasiliensis were individually subjected to 
hydrodistillation in a Clevenger type apparatus during 
4 h. After extraction, the essential oils were dried over 
anhydrous Na2SO4 and stored in sealed vials at low 
temperature. These procedures afforded 63 mg (0.55%) 
from leaves oil and 1.624 mg (0.18%) from stem barks oil. 
Chemical and biological studies of the obtained crude oils 
were performed immediately. 
General procedures
Silica gel 60 (63-200 mm, Merck) was used for 
adsorption chromatography and Sephadex LH-20 
(Pharmacia) was used in exclusion chromatography. GC 
analysis were performed in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II 
chromatograph (using helium as carrier gas) equipped with 
a FID detector and a capillary column HP-5, cross linked 
5% phenyl in 95% silicone (30 m × 0.32 mm, I.D., 0.25 mm 
film thickness), automatic injector (HP 7673) and electronic 
integrator (HP3396A). Temperature programming was 
performed as follows: 100 °C isothermal for 2 min, 
100-240 °C at 5 °C min-1, then isothermal at 240 °C for 
10 min. The injector and detector (FID) temperatures 
were established as 180 °C and 260 °C, respectively. 
Component concentrations were calculated from GC peak 
areas in the order of HP-5 column elution (RRt - retention 
time in seconds, as showed in Table 1). GC/MS analysis 
was carried out in a Shimadzu GC-17A chromatograph 
interfaced with a MS-QP-5050A mass spectrometer. 
Helium was used as the carried gas. The MS operating 
conditions were: ionization voltage 70 eV, ion source 
230 °C. The GC analysis was done with a DB-5 column 
(30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, with 0.25 μm film 
thickness) and the operating conditions were identical with 
those of the GC analysis. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were 
measured at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker 
model DPX-300 spectrometer with sample dissolved 
in CDCl3 containing 1% of TMS (Aldrich). Formalin, 
carrageenan and indomethacin were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich. Purity was assessed by HPLC and NMR 
as > 99%. Unless stated otherwise, all other solvents were 
from Synth and Sigma.
Compounds identification
The crude oils were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. 
The identification of the components was based on 
the comparison o their mass spectra with those in the 
spectrometer data base (Willey 229 library) and confirmed 
by determination of their Kovats indexes (KI), which were 
determined relatively to the retention times of a series of 
n-alkanes.18
Chemical Composition and Anti-Inflammatory Evaluation of Essential Oils from Leaves J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1762
Isolation of polygodial from stem bark from D. brasiliensis
Dried and powdered stem bark of D. brasiliensis (687 g) 
were exhaustively extracted with hexane (6 × 1000 mL, 
24 h each) to afford 8.72 g of hexane extract. Part of the 
crude extract (6.0 g) was subjected to silica gel column 
chromatography (178 g, 40 × 2 cm) eluted with hexane 
containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), 
to give nine fractions (1-9). Fraction 4 (4.1 g), eluted with 
hexane:EtOAc 8:2 (4.2 g) was purified using repeated 
Sephadex LH-20 (30 g, 20 × 2 cm) chromatographic 
procedures using CH2Cl2:Me2CO (3:2) as solvent to 
afford 5 groups (I -V). Colorless oil was obtained from 
group IV (3.0 g), which was analyzed by chromatographic 
(GC > 99%) and spectroscopic methods (NMR and 
LREIMS). After comparison to literature data,19 this 
fraction showed to be composed by polygodial. 
Animals
Female Swiss mices (25-30 g) were used throughout 
the experiments. The animals were supplied by the Centro 
Multidisciplinar para Investigação Biológica (Universidade 
Estadual de Campinas - UNICAMP). All the experiments 
were carried out with strict adherence to ethical guidelines.20 
Acute toxicity (LD50)
The acute toxicity in mice (n = 5) was evaluated by 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of crude oils/polygodial in 
different doses from 0.1 to 1.2 g kg-1, using DMSO 1% in 
saline solution (NaCl) 0.9% (m/v) for negative control. In 
this condition was observed that in concentration below of 
0.5 g kg-1 no obits or effect were observed in the animal 
groups. Therefore, the concentration of 200 mg kg-1 was 
determined to evaluation of anti-inflammatory experiments. 
The effect and dead of animal were observed after 48 h of 
the drug administration.21
Antinociceptive assay
The formalin test was conducted as previosly 
described,22 with some minor modifications. Mices (vehicle 
and treated) were observed simultaneously for 0-30 min 
after intraplantar (i. pl.) injection of 20 μL formalin solution 
2.5% (0.92% formaldehyde, made up in saline solution 
0.9%) under the plantar surface of the right paw of mice. 
The time (in seconds) that the animals spent licking or 
lifting the injected paw was timed with a chronometer. 
The initial nociceptive response normally peaked about 
0-10 min after formalin injection (first phase) and was 
followed by a second peak that occurred 15-30 min after 
formalin injection (second phase).22 Animals (n = 5) were 
pre-treated with the essential oils from leaves, stem bark 
and polygodial from D. brasiliensis (200 mg kg-1 i.p.) one 
hour before formalin injection. Control animals received 
only vehicle (DMSO 1% in saline solution 0.9%), which 
was used to dilute the essential oils and polygodial. 
Statistical analyses were made by ANOVA method.

Anti-inflammatory assay
Carrageenan induced oedema assay was carried out 
according to Lima et al.23 Oedema was induced on the right 
hind foot of mice by intraplantar injection (i.pl.) of 20 mL 
of a solution of 1% carrageenan in 0.9% saline solution 
(NaCl, m/v). Local oedema was quantified by measuring the 
thickness of injected paws with a paquimeter at 30, 60, 90 
and 180 min after injection. One hour before carrageenan 
injection, the animals (n = 5) were pre-treated with the 
essential oils from leaves and stem barks and polygodial 
obtained from D. brasiliensis (200 mg kg-1 i.p.). Negative 
control animals received 50 mL of vehicle (DMSO 1% in 
saline solution), which was used to dilute the essential oils 
and polygodial while the control positive group received 
50 mL the indomethacin (10 mg kg-1 i.p.). Statistical 
analyses were made by ANOVA method. 
Results and Discussion
The results for the chemical composition of the essential 
oils from leaves and stem barks from D. brasiliensis are 
shown in Table 1. A total of 28 volatile components were 
identified, accounting for 63.79% and 97.14% of the 
volatiles from leaves and stem bark oils, respectively. In 
the oil from leaves, composed by sixteen identified volatile 
derivatives, the sesquiterpenoids predominated (52.31%), 
with a-cedrene (6.87%), bicyclogermacrene (5.31%), 
t-muurolol (7.75%) and drimenol (9.96%) as the main 
derivatives (Figure 1). It is important mentioned that the 
occurrence of drimenol has been restrict to Winteraceae, 
Solanaceae and Polygonaceae species.13 Otherwise, 
seventeen constituents were identified from the stem barks 
oil with a high percentage of monoterpenes (90.02%) 
being a-pinene (39.50%), b-pinene (7.24%), D3-carene 
(5.65%), terpinolene (9.02%) and a-terpineol (14.45%) the 
most significant components in the monoterpene fraction 
(Figure 1).
Previous studies on volatile oils from D. brasiliensis, 
from the South region of Brazil (São Francisco de Paula - 
RS), showed that the main derivative was cyclocolorenone 
(16.0% to 32.3% in the leaves and 46.7% to 49.7% in stem 
barks).13 However, as showed in Table 1, in the volatile oils 
analyzed in the present work (“Campos de Altitude” region), 
this compound was not detected. To confirm the absence of 
cyclocolorenone, the both oils were also submitted to 1H 
and 13C NMR spectral analysis, in which the characteristic 
signals from aromadendrane skeleton at approximately 
dH 0.3-0.6 (H-6) / dC 20.0 (C-11) were not observed.24,25 
Although qualitative differences have been detected in the 
composition of the oils from D. brasiliensis, it is important 
mentioned that the sesquiterpenes were the main derivatives 
in the both oils from leaves. Otherwise, the comparison of 
the stem bark oils showed a complete difference in their 
composition, since in the present study were detected 
monoterpenes as major derivatives. Therefore, the detected 
chemical differences would be attributed to microclimatic 
conditions related to the different environments and 
geographic sites in which the plants grown.26 Additionally, 
the crude hexane extract from stem bark (8.72 g) was 
chromatographed over silica gel followed by filtration of 
Sephadex LH-20. After 1H NMR analysis of all fractions 
obtained from fractionation procedures, the signals relative 
to aromadendrane skeleton were not observed, confirming 
the absence of cyclocolorenone in the analyzed species. 
Otherwise, was obtained a great amount (3.0 g , 34.4%) of 
a pure compound whose 1H NMR spectrum showed signals 
at d 9.50 (d, J 4.4 Hz, 1H) and 9.43 (s, 1H), characteristic 
of aldehyde hydrogens. These data associated to the 
singlets at d 0.90 (3H), 0.92 (3H) and 0.93 (3H), as well 
as to ddd at d 7.12 (J 7.5, 2.2 and 2.1 Hz, 1H), showed to 
be characteristic of sesquiterpene polygodial.19 Finally, 
analysis of 13C NMR spectrum, which showed peaks at sp2 
carbons at d 154.3 (C-7), 138.3 (C-8), carbonyl carbons at 
d 202.1 (C-11), 193.2 (C-12), and methyl carbons at d 33.1 
(C-13), 21.9 (C-14) and 15.2 (C-15) confirmed the proposal 
structure (Figure 1).19 
Due to the occurrence of polygodial in the crude hexane 
extract from stem bark of D. brasiliensis associated to the 
different proportions of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes 
in the essential oils from leaves and stem bark, the

Chemical Composition and Anti-Inflammatory Evaluation of Essential Oils from Leaves J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1764
antinociceptive activity of these products was evaluated by 
induction for formalin in mice.22 As showed in Figure 2, the 
both essential oils (leaves and stem barks) did not inhibited 
neurogenic pain in the first phase of these experiments. 
However, the previous administration (60 min) of the crude 
essential oils and polygodial at 200 mg kg-1, reduced the 
second phase of nociception (inflammatory origin pain) 
in 25.0% (leaves oil), 62.5% (stem bark oil) and 50.0% 
(polygodial), as showed in Figure 2. The animals treated 
with vehicle (DMSO 1% in saline solution) lick or bite 
their paws during 250 ± 10 seconds in the second phase of 
this test (p < 0.05, n = 5). Injection of formalin produced 
distinct biphasic responses being the first phase associated 
to the irritant effect of formalin in the C type sensorial 
fibers, which characterize the neurogenic pain. Otherwise, 
the second phase is associated to the inflammatory pain. 
Analgesics for central action, such as morphine, inhibit 
the both phases in contrast to drugs of peripheral action 
such as anti-inflammatories and corticoids, which inhibit 
only the second phase.22,27 Although polygodial has 
been described as antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory 
agent from D. winteri,10,17 the oil from stem barks of D. 
brasiliensis showed higher potential than this pure aldehyde 
sesquiterpene. 
Similarly, the inflammatory effect was induced by 
injection of carrageenan 1%, which produced an oedema in 
the paw after 30 min (C = 3.8 mm; n = 5).27,28 The previous 
administration (60 min) of the crude oil from stem barks 
from D. brasiliensis at 200 mg kg-1, showed an oedema 
reduction similar to the positive control indomethacin at 
10 mg kg-1 but superior to that observed to pure polygodial 
at same concentration (200 mg kg-1) before 60 min of 
carrageenan administration (Figure 3). This result indicated 
that the volatile derivatives from stem bark showed 
antiedematogenic/anti-inflammatory proprieties due to 
reduction of acute oedema. The potent activity of the oil 
from stem bark might be attributed, at least in part, to its 
higher monoterpene content (90.0%) in comparison to the 
leaves oil, mainly due the predominance of the monoterpene 
a-pinene, which represent 39.5% of the oil content and 
showed anti-inflammatory effect.29 The experimental 
evidences showing that the crude oil from stem barks of 
D. brasiliensis showed pronounced anti-inflammatory 
proprieties when administered in mices. The obtained 
results were similar to those observed to sesquiterpene 
polygodial, an anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive agent 
obtained from the extract from stem barks of D. winter10 
and D. brasiliensis.6
Conclusions
The predominance of monoterpenes in the stem bark 
oil and sesquiterpenes in the leaves oil from D. brasiliensis 
collected in Campos do Jordão - SP indicated a different 
profile of that previously detected to oils from this specie, 
whose material was obtained from São Francisco de 
Paula - RS. This variation could be partially explained by 
different microclimatic factors in these regions as well as 
altitude, which affect the production of metabolites.26 These 
factors could explain also the absence of cyclocolorenone, 
which was suggested previously as a chemomarker of 
D. brasiliensis.13 Analysis of the crude hexane extract 
afforded polygodial as major component and confirmed 
the absence of this ketone aromadendrane derivative. In

Lago et al. 1765Vol. 21, No. 9, 2010
a biological point of view, this study confirms the anti-
inflammatory proprieties of D. brasiliensis, which could 
be attributed not exclusively to polygodial, but at least in 
part, to the high proportion of monoterpenes in the volatile 
oils, mainly a-pinene. It is important mentioned that this 
compound was detected in low amount in the no active 
essential oil obtained from the leaves from D. brasiliensis.
