Abstract
Key message The dynamics of metabolites from leaves to roots of Panax ginseng during development has revealed 
the tissue-specific and year-specific metabolic networks.
Abstract Being an essential Oriental medicinal plant, ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is a slow-growing perennial herb-
accumulating pharmaceutically active metabolites such as ginsenosides in roots during growth. However, little is known 
about how ginseng plants survive in the harsh environments such as winter cold and summer heat for a longer period and 
accumulates those active metabolites as the plant grows. To understand the metabolic kinetics in both source and sink organs 
such as leaves and roots of ginseng plant, respectively, and to assess the changes in ginsenosides biosynthesis during ginseng 
growth, we investigated the metabolic profiles from leaves and roots of 1-, 4-, and 6-year-old field-grown ginseng plants. 
Using an integrated non-targeted metabolomic approach, we identified in total 348 primary and secondary metabolites, 
which provided us for the first time a global metabolomic assessment of ginseng during growth, and morphogenesis. Strik-
ingly, the osmoprotectants and oxidized chemicals were highly accumulated in 4- and 6-year-old ginseng leaves suggested 
that ginseng develop a wide range of metabolic strategies to adapt unfavorable conditions as they mature. In 6-year-old 
plants, ginsenosides were decreased in leaves but increased in roots up to 1.2- to sixfold, supporting the view that there is a 
long-distance transport of ginsenosides from leaves to roots as ginseng plants mature. Our findings provide insights into the 
metabolic kinetics during the development of ginseng plant and this could complement the pharmacological importance of 
ginseng and its compounds according to their age.

Introduction
Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is an adaptogenic herb in 
the Araliaceae family that has been cultivated in East Asia 
for thousands of years. The ginseng roots were shown to 
have antitumor, antidiabetic, antiaging, immune and improv-
ing cognitive function and are rich in secondary metabolites 
(Kim et al. 2015). Among the known metabolites in gin-
seng roots, triterpene saponins (also called ginsenosides) 
are nearly exclusively found in ginseng and widely recog-
nized as the main active ingredient that contributes to its 
pharmacological efficacy. The backbone of ginsenosides 
are dammarenediol, which is being cyclized from squalene 
mostly via the mevalonic acid pathway (MVP) in the cyto-
sol, including the protopanaxadiol (PPD) and the proto-
panaxatriol (PPT) groups (Oh et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2015).

Ginseng is a slow-growing perennial herbaceous plant. 
The aboveground part shows distinct morphologies during 
vegetative development in different growth years. First-year 
(Y1) ginseng plant produces a single compound leaf without 
stem and in subsequent years until the fourth (Y4) to sixth 
(Y6) growth years, the plant develops more leaves that are 
attached to petioles on the stem (Fig. 1a). Ginseng plant 
starts to flower in the third year, and usually produce seeds 
from the fourth year. The tap root grows slowly during the 
first 3 years, and increases in diameter from the fourth year 
to sixth year, and then it can be harvested. A Y6 ginseng 
root is about 7–10 cm in length, about 3 cm in diameter, 
and contains several lateral roots and abundant fine roots. 
It is regarded as the mature ginseng because it has the best 
mass and shape as well as the highest amounts of second-
ary metabolites (Lin et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2015). During 
the ginseng cultivation, one major challenge is that ginseng 
plants are easily suffered from environmental stresses such 
as high light, salinity, and fungal infection, thus making 
them less survivable at Y6 (Shin et al. 2016). Intriguingly, 
ginseng roots accumulate more ginsenosides as they get 
older, whereas the leaves accumulate the maximal amount 
of ginsenosides during the first or second growth year (Wang 
et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2007). We hypothesized that more 
accumulated metabolites in older roots may be attributable 
to the high pharmacological value of Y6 roots. Systematic 
understanding on how ginseng plants synthesize, transport 
and accumulate metabolites in the leaves and roots during 
their growth remains scanty.
Recently, various metabolomics platforms including 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and liq-
uid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS) have been 
successfully used to identify cultivation age of ginseng (Shin 
et al. 2007, 2016; Lin et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2011; Yang 
et al. 2012; Shan et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2015; Liu et al. 
2017a). Metabolic profiling using LC/MS was successfully 
applied to discriminate Panax species or organs (Dan et al. 
2008; Yang et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Mao et al. 2014; 
Park et al. 2014; Qiu et al. 2016). However, these studies 
mainly focused on the authentication of commercialized 
ginseng products and mostly targeted ginsenosides. Using 
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), 11 fatty 
acids and 23 nonpolar primary metabolites were identified 
from Panax of different ages (Zhang et al. 2013a, b; Cui 
et al. 2015), and 91 and 109 metabolites were identified from 
2- to 5-year-old roots and 1- to 5-year-old different tissues of 
P. ginseng, respectively (Cui et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2017b).

to discriminate ginseng leaves of 1- to 3-year-old suggested 
that the metabolome of ginseng leaves get alter depending 
on the age of the plant (Kwon et al. 2014). Despite these 
insights provided by abovementioned studies, fewer studies 
have focused on the metabolic kinetics of whole metabo-
lites both in ginseng leaves and roots along different growth 
years.
To reveal the metabolic change along ginseng develop-
ment, we examined metabolomic profiles in the source tissue 
leaves and the sink tissue roots from Y1, Y4, and Y6 plants, 
using an integrated GC/MS and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC)/MS/MS. We identified a total of 
348 primary and secondary metabolites in ginseng tissues. 
Notably, the number of identified metabolites was at least 
three times higher than those of previous analyses of gin-
seng plant or related species. Remarkable dynamic changes 
of metabolites were observed in ginseng roots and leaves 
along the ginseng development, which were in good agree-
ment with the developmental stage induced physiological 
and morphological changes. Moreover, our results suggested 
a flow of ginsenosides from the leaf to the root as ginseng 
matures, providing important insights into how ginsenosides 
accumulate in ginseng roots.
Results
Metabolic profiling of ginseng leaves and roots
To understand the global metabolic changes in ginseng dur-
ing its development, we collected leaves and roots from Y1, 
Y4 and Y6 ginseng plants. Using an established metabolic 
profiling approach with GC/MS and UPLC/MS/MS, we 
identified 323 and 416 metabolites from leaves and roots, 
respectively; among them, 223 metabolites from leaves and 
293 from roots had known structures while the remaining 
were unknown. From the total population, we assessed 348 
metabolites with known structures, out of those 55 metabo-
lites were from leaves and 125 were from roots specifically, 
and 168 metabolites were found common to both leaves and 
roots (Table S1, Fig. 1b). The number of identified metabo-
lites was much higher than previous metabolic studies in 
ginseng plants, which facilitated further statistic analyses.
Those 348 metabolites of known structures have covered 
most of the known central metabolic pathways in plants, 
thus reflecting the final results of the corresponding physi-
ological activities of ginseng leaves and roots in the tested 
three developmental stages. These metabolites were mapped 
onto eight metabolic super-pathways and their underlying 47 
sub-pathways (Table S2), as defined by the Plant Metabolic 
Net (PMN) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG). They included primary metabolites such as most 
amino acids and their derivatives, carbohydrates, lipids, 
cofactors, prosthetic groups and electron carriers (CPGECs), 
nucleotides, as well as 32 secondary metabolites.
Global metabolic changes in different growth years
To obtain a global view of the metabolic changes during 
ginseng development, principal component analysis (PCA) 
was performed on the identified metabolites. PCA showed 
a clear separation of metabolites among Y1, Y4, and Y6 
leaves (Fig. 2a) and roots (Fig. 2b). In leaves, the first prin-
cipal component (PC1), which accounted for 48.39% of the 
total variance, separated young leaves (Y1L) and mature 
leaves (Y4L and Y6L). Similarly, the second principal 
component (PC2), which accounted for the left 30.75% of 
the total variance, separated Y4L from Y6L. In roots, PC1 
and PC2 that accounted for 40.97% and the left 22.26% of 
the total variance, respectively, resolved the classification 
of Y1R, Y4R, and Y6R. Finally, the metabolomes of Y1L 
and Y1R were distinguishable from the corresponding tissue 
samples of other growth years, consistent with the distinc-
tive morphological and developmental features of first-year 
plants (Fig. 1a).
Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed considerable 
changes in the levels of a wide range of amino acids, carbo-
hydrates, fatty acids, cofactors and secondary metabolites 
in leaves and roots across the ginseng development (Fig. 3, 
Tables S3, S4). The levels of many amino acids increased 
while the amount of several lipids and peptides decreased 
over growth years in both leaves and roots. Notably, the main 
difference in metabolites between leaves and roots were in 
secondary metabolites which showed decreased levels of 
phenylpropanoids and terpenoids in Y6L while increased 
levels of them in Y6R (Fig. 3).
Specific metabolic changes in different growth years 
of leaves and roots
Amino acid metabolism
From the detected amino acids, the amount of glutamate 
family amino acids (GFAAs) displayed the most signifi-
cant changes in both leaves and roots (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6; 
Tables 1, 2). In particular, the levels of the four nitrogen 
(N)-rich amino acids, Glu, Gln, Asp and Asn were highly 
increased in roots as plant aged. Gln showed the largest 
changes (17-fold), followed by Asn and Glu, which were 
more than fivefold in Y6R as compared with that in Y1R 
(Table S6). The increased GFAA metabolism seemed to 
be linked with the accumulation of polyamines and orni-
thine in leaves and roots. The obvious accumulation of 
polyamine in Y4R and Y6R is consistent with the previ-
ous report that polyamine stimulates ginseng root growth 
(Park et al. 1990). As ginseng grew, the levels of all of the

1 3
serine family amino acids (SFAAs), except the precursor 
Gly, increased to threefold in roots and in leaves (Fig. 6). 
Consistent with the high accumulation of Ser in Y6L and 
Y6R, betaine, an osmoprotectant associated with drought/
salt response in plants (Ros et al. 2014), was the highest 
accumulated metabolite in Y4L (tenfold) and Y6L (27-
fold) as compared with that in Y1L (Tables 1; S3, S5).
Free amino acids, water soluble proteins, peptides, 
amines, free nucleotides, nucleic acid bases and alkaloids 
were highly accumulated in ginseng roots, which may 
facilitate the accumulation of metabolites as the ginseng 
root increases in size after 4 years (Fig. 4). High accumu-
lation of N-containing metabolites in ginseng roots may 
contribute to the Y6R roots in terms of resisting roots, 
hence the better weight, shape, and quality of Y6R. Pre-
viously, peptides in ginseng root possibly have the func-
tion of potentially antilipolytic, and antidiabetic activities 
(Ando et al. 1980; Ye et al. 2016), thus we speculate that 
the high level of peptides in ginseng roots contributes to 
ginseng pharmacological activities.
Sugar and lipidic metabolites
The Y4L accumulated the highest level of sucrose (Fig. 3), 
suggesting a high demand of carbohydrates in leaves 
(source organ) of Y4-plants. Among the changes in leaves 
over the developmental time course, mannitol was heav-
ily loaded and almost 50-fold higher in Y6L than in Y1L 
(Tables 1; S5). In addition, several other carbohydrates 
associated with the raffinose family of the oligosaccha-
ride (galactinol, raffinose), as well as fructose and xylose 
showed a higher profile in Y4L and Y4R (Tables S3, S4). 
Similarly, fructose 6-phosphate, a metabolite with a cen-
tral role in primary carbohydrate metabolism, accumulated 
strongly in Y4L (3.3-fold) and Y4R (3.6-fold) compared 
to first-year samples (Tables 1, 2), but decreased in Y6L 
and Y6R (Tables S3, S4). Interestingly, in contrast to 
highly accumulated mannitol that is derived from fructose 
6-phosphate, the osmolyte sorbitol derived from glucose 
6-phosphate was significantly lower in Y4L and Y6L (-5-
fold) (Table S5).

Most of the free fatty acids, including 16:0 palmitate and

oxidative stress. The reduction in linoleic acid phospholip-
ids, which exist as the most abundant fatty acid in ginseng 
root (Zhang et al. 2013b), and the elevation of free fatty 
acids and other intermediates such as glycerophosphoryl-
choline (GPC) (Fig. 3; Tables 2; S6) support the notion that 
membrane lipids are remobilized for defense (Khajuria et al.

2013) and suggest the existence of an active defense system 
in Y6 via reprogramming lipid metabolic pathways.
Cofactors and nucleotides
The metabolomics analysis has revealed that the amount of 
CPGEC accumulated in leaves as the ginseng grew. Nico-
tinamide riboside, the precursor of NAD or nicotinamide, 
accumulated in Y1L and highly decreased in Y4L (11-fold) 
and Y6L (17-fold) (Table 1; S5), possibly contributing to 
the escalation of NAD + in Y4L (4.3-fold) and further rise 
of nicotinamide (8.7-fold) and nicotinate (threefold) in 
Y6L than Y1L. The reduction of uracil (twofold) together 
with the increase of 3′-CMP (3.6-fold) during root growth 
(Table S6) possibly suggest the supply of pyrimidine nucleo-
tides for the biosynthesis of phospholipids or polysaccha-
rides for root growth and RNA and DNA synthesis (Katahira 
and Ashihara 2002).
Many antioxidant metabolites including vitamins B, C, 
and E showed obvious changes in ginseng leaves as plants

coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, accumulated remarkably 
in Y4L (fivefold) and Y6L (3.5-fold) as compared with

tion during photooxidation or oxidative stress (Munn`e 
and Alegre 2002), accumulated in Y4L (1.5-fold) and

study which used terpenoids to distinguish ginseng ages 
(Cui et al. 2015). In this study, we detected an increase of 
squalene, the precursor of ginsenosides derived from the 
mevalonic acid pathway, in Y4L (1.5-fold) and Y6L (2.3-
fold) compared to Y1L, while there was no significant 
decrease of squalene content in root during growth. These 
findings were in consistent with the medicinal importance 
of ginseng roots, ginsenosides accumulated dramatically to 
1.2- to sevenfold in root as the plant grew (Fig. 7; Table S4). 
Among the 40 different ginsenosides that have been identi-
fied and isolated from different tissues of P. ginseng, the 
major ginsenosides in roots and leaves are the PPD-type 
Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd, and the PPT-type Re, Rg1 and Rf, 
respectively, which normally account for more than 80% of 
the total ginsenosides in P. ginseng (Kim et al. 2015). Our 
metabolomic analysis identified seven of these major gin-
senosides as well as other PPD- and PPT-type ginsenosides 
such as F2, Rg2, Rh1, and F1.
Ginsenosides accumulated continuously in roots as plants 
grew, even though the reported total ginsenoside content and 
ginsenoside profiles vary among different studies (Kim et al. 
2015). In our study, nearly all the detected ginsenosides in

roots increased over the time (Fig. 7). All of the ten detected 
ginsenosides accumulated significantly in Y4R, among 
which ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg2 continued to increase in 
Y6R. The level of ginsenoside Rg2 was sevenfold higher 
in Y6R than Y1R (Table S4). Rb1’s increase in root and 
decrease in leaves during its growth was consistent with pre-
vious reports (Wang et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2007; Kim et al. 
2012), confirming that Rb1 can be used as a marker for Y6R 
(Kim et al. 2012).
Leaves contained a reduced level of ginsenosides com-
pared with roots (Fig. 7), which was consistent with previous 
reports (Wang et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2007). Most ginseno-
sides including Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rf, and Rh1 showed lower 
levels in Y6L than Y1L (Table S3), which was different from 
previous studies (Shi et al. 2007; Li et al. 2012). This vari-
ation in individual ginsenosides may be caused by different 
growth stage and harvest time, and/or soil environment (Kim 
et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2013). Interestingly, unlike other 
ginsenosides, the levels of Re and Rg2 increased two- and 
sixfold in Y6L from Y1L (Table S5; Fig. 7).
Phenolic compounds have been reported to have anti-
oxidant activity in ginseng (Chung et al. 2012). Alkaloid 
(tryptophan betaine) and phenolics (five benzenoids and 
five phenylpropanoids) besides ginsenosides accumulated 
in Y4R or Y6R as compared with those in Y1R (Fig. 3, 
Table S4), suggesting that ginseng roots accumulate mostly 
carbon (C)-based secondary metabolites, this correlates to 
the high medicinal value of older ginseng roots. Here, we 
identified flavonols including kaempferols and quercetin, 
and flavanone naringenin in leaves, but not in roots. Kaemp-
ferol and kaempferol 7-O-glucoside were increased highly 
in Y4L as compared with those in Y1L, while quercetin 
3-O-glucoside increased in Y4L but decreased highly in 
Y6L (Table S5), supporting the view that antioxidants are 
highly accumulated in old ginseng leaves to prevent oxida-
tive stress (Agati et al. 2012). Consistent with the previous 
findings (Chung et al. 2012), the levels of benzenoids, such 
as vanillate, and benzyl alcohol, a type of phenolic acid, 
and antioxidant polyphenol were increased in Y4R or Y6R. 
However, most phenylpropanoids were not significantly 
changed in roots, except the high accumulation of secoiso-
lariciresinol in Y6R (Table S4).
Discussion
Understanding metabolic changes during plant develop-
ment allows us to reveal the biochemical pathways that 
control development and physiological status (Kooke and 
Keurentjes 2011). However, metabolic diversity in most 
medicinal plants that have nutritional, pharmaceutical and 
chemical importance is poorly characterized. Here we pre-
sent the first global scenario of ginseng metabolism in asso-
ciation with growth, development, and morphology (Fig. 8), 
which demonstrates tissue-specific and year-specific meta-
bolic networks within ginseng plants.
Dynamics of metabolites during development
Ginseng is a slow-growing medicinal plant that generally 
requires at least 4–6 years of cultivation before harvest. Pre-

and UPLC-Q-Tof MS-based non-targeted metabolomic 
analysis have been mainly used to discriminate ginseng 
roots in different cultivated years, which lacked a clear 
identification of metabolites from ginseng plants (Lin et al. 
2010; Kim et al. 2011, 2012; Kwon et al. 2014), let alone 
the dynamic patterns. In this study, we used non-targeted 
metabolomic profiling to identify various primary and sec-
ondary metabolites, with those identified metabolites we 
could clearly differentiate Y1 from Y4 and Y6 samples and 
leaves from roots (Fig. 2). Notably, we observed remark-
able growth year dependent alterations in many metabolites 
such as N-containing metabolites, sugars and fatty acids in 
both leaves and roots of ginseng (Figs. 3, 4). Especially, 
the accumulation of amino acids and other N-containing 
metabolites such as ornithine, and polyamines in both leaves 
and roots as plants mature in Y4 and Y6 indicated that those 
metabolites are likely important for the increase of size and 
ginsenosides contents of roots. In addition, our non-targeted 
metabolomics analysis also identified vitamin precursors, 
stigmasterol and natural antioxidants. The levels of natural 
antioxidants and ginsenosides in roots increased as ginseng 
plants grow (Tables S3, S4), consistent with the view that 
older ginseng has more beneficial and pharmacological effi-
cacy to human beings than the younger roots.
Dynamic C/N metabolism in roots and leaves
Changes in the level of soluble sugars were suggested to link 
plant metabolism with the environment, as sugar levels are 
influenced by both sink activities and biotic/abiotic stresses 
(Geigenberger 2011). Raffinose and galactinol, which were 
found to accumulate in both Y4L and Y4R in our study, were 
documented to be defense-response osmoprotectants under 
salt and drought stresses (Nishizawa et al. 2008). Sugar 
alcohols, mannitol and sorbitol have been linked to stress 
tolerance, especially tolerance against salinity and drought 
stresses (Chen et al. 2005). In Y6L, the dramatic increase 
of mannitol was sharp in contrast to the decrease of sorbitol 
(Table S5), which is also a stress-induced osmoprotectant. 
This observation implies that mannitol may be the preferred 
osmoprotectant in aged ginseng leaves. The increase of gly-
colysis components in Y4L and Y4R indicates active respi-
ration for energy production, which was also supported by 
the high level of  NAD+ at this stage (Fig. 5; Tables 1, 2).
Y6R accumulated high levels of Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn 
and their derivates (Table S6), which are considered as the 
sensor of N status (Chen et al. 2005). However, these mol-
ecules decreased continuously in leaves as ginseng aged, 
implying the critical role of N-derived metabolites in the 
development of ginseng roots. In addition, the reallocation 
of N that has been stored as protein reserves is important 
for the spring growth of perennials (Rentsch et al. 2007). 
In ginseng, the high level of Gln was shown to be related 
to the low-branching and slow-growing hairy root in vitro 
(Jung et al. 2006). Therefore, this N assimilation could be 
an important factor in regulating ginseng root morphology 
during long time cultivation.
C/N ratio has been reported to be a key signal in plant 
growth and development (Nunes-Nesi et al. 2010; Balaza-
deh et al. 2014). Our observation of the predominance of 
N-transporting amino acids and derivates in aged leaves and 
roots, in contrast to the decreased level of the C status at the 
Y6 stage, suggests a general imbalance of C/N in roots that 
point toward a C deficit. C supply is largely connected to the 
photosynthetic activity in source leaf (Kooke and Keurentjes 
2011). Ginseng has less number of stomata (Lee 1988) and 
thinner leaves which contain mostly sponge-type meso-
phyll cells without clearly distinguished compact palisade 
cells (Park 1980), which may cause reduced photosynthetic 
rate. These accumulated C/N sources might compensate 
the reduced levels of photosynthesis and photorespiration 
metabolites after 4 years of growth.
From an evolutionary point of view, we propose that 
ginseng has become a slow-growing plant after adaptation 
to the reduced energy requirement under limited photosyn-
thesis and osmotic stress exposure, as slow-growing plants 
are generally found in low nutrient and stressful environ-
ments (Atkinson et al. 2012). Wild ginseng that has been 
grown in nature for hundreds of years develops smaller root 
and a slow growth rate compared with field-grown ginseng. 
Cultivated ginseng increases the number of leaves each 
year, whereas wild ginseng increases leaf numbers every 
3–5 years and eventually produces 4–6 compound leaves. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that the difficulty of cultivating 
ginseng for more than 6 years in the field may be caused 
by a limited C supply from leaves. Supporting our hypoth-
esis is the finding that compared with ginseng grown in the 
field, hydroponically cultured ginseng grows more quickly 
as it receives sufficient light and N supply (Kim et al. 2010). 
Taken together, C metabolism and N allocation are impor-
tant for ginseng root development and C deficiency may be 
the major limitation for ginseng growth in the field.
Ginseng accumulates defense metabolites 
during growth
Our results suggested that ginseng plants may have evolved 
strategies to avoid oxidative damages, such as producing 
endogenous antioxidants including ascorbate, glutathione, 
and vitamins, and generating secondary metabolites includ-
ing triterpenes, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids (Fig. 6). 
In addition, ascorbate, glutathione and tocopherol pools act 
as redox buffers in plant cells (Foyer and Noctor 2005). Met 
sulfoxide is an oxidized metabolite generated by a variety of 
reactive molecules and is implicated in plant oxidative stress 
(Bechtold et al. 2004). The relative ratio of Met sulfoxide

to Met increased in Y6L, suggesting that Y6 plants have 
undergone oxidative stress. The reduced level of ascor-
bate and increased level of dehydroascorbate in ginseng 
leaves as plants grow older (Fig. 5) is consistent with the 
age-dependent oxidative stress imposed on the plant (Sup-
plemental Fig. 1). Thus, increased oxidative stress and loss 
of membrane integrity are key characteristics of aging in 
ginseng. However, ginseng plants contain higher levels of 
antioxidants against ROS production in Y6 than Y4 plants, 
suggesting stress adaption in aged plants by balancing the 
production and quenching of ROS.
Given that aged ginseng leaves contain more osomopro-
tectants (Fig. 8), and accumulated salts in the field with 4- to 
6-years’ cultivated ginseng, we postulate that these plants 
are mainly suffering from osmotic stress. It is striking that 
compounds with strong osmotic properties, such as the sugar 
alcohol mannitol, quaternary ammonium compounds, and 
GPC, are highly accumulated in Y6L (Tables 1; S5). Nota-
bly, we found that in ginseng plants, amino acid-derived 
metabolites including GABA and polyamines accumulated 
in aging leaves. The accumulated stachydrine in Y4L is 
known as an osmoprotectant that is especially related to 
salinity stress (Trinchant et al. 2004). Therefore, our metabo-
lomic analyses illustrate that ginseng has developed a whole 
range of strategies to adapt its metabolism to unfavorable 
growth conditions and that enhanced stress resistance is not 
due to the action of a single compound.
Accumulation and long‑distance transport 
of ginsenosides
Although ginseng root is used for medicinal purpose, gin-
senosides are distributed in all tissues. Ginsenoside concen-
trations fluctuate dramatically in response to environmental 
stimuli such as salt, light, JA, and other signaling molecules 
(Oh et al. 2014; Rahimi et al. 2015). In plants, different envi-
ronmental circumstances evoke different effects on the bal-
ance between primary and secondary metabolisms. Under 
nutrient-limiting or stressful environments, plants grow 
slower because they allocate more resources to constitu-
tive defense (Endara and Coley 2011). In support of these 
views, low nitrate concentrations could induce ginsenoside 
production in cell culture (Liu and Zhong 1997), whereas 
ginseng roots cultured by high-N hydroponics display faster 
growth but lower ginsenoside contents (Kim et al. 2010). As 
osmotic stress could cause growth inhibition but stimulate 
the accumulation of secondary metabolites including gin-
senosides (Wu et al. 2005), we propose that many second-
ary metabolites in ginseng might be produced for defense 
response. Little is known about the physiological role of gin-
senosides in plants beside the major role as defense against 
pathogens (Nicol et al. 2002; Kochan et al. 2013). Recent 
studies, however, revealed its association with plant growth 
(Zhang et al. 2011) and ginsenosides’ different localizations 
at cortex, xylem and periderm in different ages of root (Lee 
et al. 2017). In addition, contents of ginsenosides and total 
ginsenosides are not positively correlated with 5- to 18-year-
old ginseng root (He et al. 2016), contents of ginsenoside 
Rb1, Rc, and Rd varied widely with ages in samples from 
different cultivation regions (Xiao et al. 2015), and changes 
in the ratio of Re and Rg1 are dependent on the harvest 
season (Liu et al. 2017a), suggesting that ginsenosides accu-
mulation varies to physiological status. Different change pat-
terns of individual ginsenosides in leaves and roots along 
plant growth (Fig. 7) may be associated with their different 
biological activities in plant growth (Kim et al. 2015), which 
remains to be further comprehensively elucidated.
The level of squalene, the precursor of ginsenosides, was 
increased in leaves and decreased in roots over growth years 
(Fig. 7). It suggests the active biosynthesis of ginsenosides 
or their precursors in leaves and their dynamic transport into 
the root. In agreement with this hypothesis, Schramek et al. 
(2014) proposed that derivatives of photosynthetic metabo-
lites such as glucose and fructose contribute to the synthesis 
for ginsenosides glycosylation or its movement into roots. 
More recently, Liu et al. (2017b) proposed that higher rates 
of photosynthesis and higher energy consumption in above-
ground parts (leaves, petioles, and stems) regulate the bio-
active compound biosynthesis of underground (lateral root 
and root) tissues. Although investigations have been done 
to understand the mechanism of ginsenoside synthesis and 
distribution, the long-distance allocation of ginsenosides 
remains largely unknown.
Our non-targeted metabolic profiling data revealed a high 
degree of metabolic dynamics in both leaves and roots of 
ginseng plants in different growth years. Notably ginseng 
metabolomes are closely associated with plant growth and 
development, and C metabolism and N allocation are critical 
for ginseng’s root formation. The metabolomic data identi-
fied in this study suggest that during evolution ginseng plants 
developed a wide range of metabolic strategies to adapt to 
unfavorable conditions. Ginsenosides synthesized in leaves 
can be transported and accumulated in roots. These findings 
provide insight into the metabolic adjustments of ginseng 
plants to unfavorable growth conditions as they develop, in 
particular, the dynamics of metabolites in the source (leaves) 
and sink (roots) tissues of ginseng.

main roots were harvested from three plants at 1-, 4-, or 
6-year-old on 1 August 2013 (temperature 23–33 °C, humid-
ity 72.8%). To avoid the effects of diurnal variations in the 
metabolic profiles, samples were collected at approximately 
15:00 p.m. and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 
fine-ground sample powders prepared using a ceramic mor-
tar and pestle under liquid nitrogen were lyophilized and 
delivered to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China 
on dry ice, and stored in a − 80 °C freezer prior to metabolite 
extraction. Each metabolite profiling has three biological 
replicates.
Metabolite profiling
Forty mg of lyophilized powder of each ginseng sample was 
extracted with 400 µl methanol under vigorous shaking. Four 
chemical standards were added in the methanol prior to 
extraction to monitor the extraction and recovery efficiency. 
After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was collected 
and divided into four aliquots: one for analysis by UPLC/
MS/MS with negative ion mode electrospray ionization opti-
mized for basic species; one for analysis by UPLC/MS/MS 
with positive ion mode electrospray ionization optimized 
for acidic species; one for analysis by GC/MS, and the last 
was reserved for backup. The detailed information on these 
platforms, including instruments, data acquisition and pro-
cessing, and compound identification and quantitation, had 
been published previously (Evans et al. 2009; Oliver et al. 
2011; Clarke 2013; Hu et al. 2014, 2016; Lin et al. 2014; 
Qu et al. 2014). Briefly, the UPLC–MS–MS portion of the 
platform was based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a 
Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer that consists of 
an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and a linear ion-trap 
(LIT) mass analyzer. The MS analysis alternated between 
MS and data-dependent MS/MS scans using dynamic exclu-
sion to record retention time, mass-to-charge ratio, and MS/
MS of all detectable ions. For GC platform, samples were 
analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning 
single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact 
ionization (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power. 
The samples were derivatized with bis trimethyl-silyl trif-
luoroacetamide prior to injection, and the retention time and 
mass-to-charge ratio for all detectable ions were measured. 
Metabolite identification is achieved by automatic matching 
of detected ion features of the samples to chemical stand-
ard entries in metabolom’s proprietary reference metabo-
lite library. The library includes retention time, molecular 
weight (M/Z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as 
well as associated MS/MS spectra of each chemical stand-
ard. This library allows rapid identification of metabolites in 
the experimental samples with high-confidence (Evans et al. 
2009). Experimental samples were randomized with quality 
control samples across the platform and run days for quality 
control of each analysis.
Metabolomic data analysis
Relative abundance of a metabolite in each sample was cal-
culated. For data normalization, missing values for a given 
metabolite in specific samples (below the instrument’s 
detection limit) were first filled with the observed minimum 
detection threshold, and then all of the raw data values were 
normalized against the median. PCA was done with SIMCA-
P 12.0 software. Significantly changed metabolites were fur-
ther determined by partial least squares-discriminant analy-
sis (PLS-DA). Heat maps of metabolites were visualized 
using Multi Experiment Viewer (MeV) version 4.8 (Saeed 
et al. 2003). Metabolic differences between ages and tis-
sues of ginseng were determined using one-way ANOVA 
in the R package, and metabolic pathways were composed 
with Cytoscape version 2.8.3. The corresponding P values 
of statistical significance (P ≤ 0.05), as well as those close to 
be statistically significant (0.05 < P < 0.10) were calculated 
by the T scores.
