Abstract
Background: The sage plant Salvia officinalis L. is used as ingredient in foods and beverages as well as in herbal
medicinal products. A major use is in the form of aqueous infusions as sage tea, which is legal to be sold as either
food or medicine. Sage may contain two health relevant substances, thujone and camphor. The aim of this study
was to develop and validate an analytical methodology to determine these active principles of sage and give a
first overview of their concentrations in a wide variety of sage foods and medicines.
Results: A GC/MS procedure was applied for the analysis of a- and b-thujone and camphor with cyclodecanone
as internal standard. The precision was between 0.8 and 12.6%, linearity was obtained from 0.1 - 80 mg/L. The
recoveries of spiked samples were between 93.7 and 104.0% (average 99.1%). The time of infusion had a
considerable influence on the content of analytes found in the teas. During the brewing time, thujone and
camphor show an increase up to about 5 min, after which saturation is reached. No effect was found for
preparation with or without a lid on the pot used for brewing the infusion. Compared to extracts with ethanol
(60% vol), which provide a maximum yield, an average of 30% thujone are recovered in the aqueous tea
preparations. The average thujone and camphor contents were 4.4 mg/L and 16.7 mg/L in food tea infusions and
11.3 mg/L and 25.4 mg/L in medicinal tea infusions.
Conclusions: The developed methodology allows the efficient determination of thujone and camphor in a wide
variety of sage food and medicine matrices and can be applied to conduct surveys for exposure assessment. The
current results suggest that on average between 3 and 6 cups of sage tea could be daily consumed without
reaching toxicological thresholds.
Background
The sage plant Salvia officinalis L. is a common ingredi-
ent used to flavour certain foods and beverages, espe-
cially in the Mediterranean diet (e.g. saltimbocca, a dish
made of veal topped with ham and sage leaves). Sage is
also used as an herbal medicinal product sold in the
form of plant materials for making herbal tea, or as
liquid extract or tincture. Depending on the intended
use, sage is therefore regulated either as food or as med-
icine. In a recent toxicological review on thujone, which
is a neurotoxic constituent of the essential oil of sage,
we noted that the food and medicine laws contain a dis-
crepancy [1].
The European food law recently deregulated the use of
thujone-containing plants in food, i.e. both the previous
limit for foodstuffs containing preparations based on
sage (25 mg/kg) and the general limit for foodstuffs (0.5
mg/kg) [2] were removed from the new flavouring regu-
lation, and only Artemisia-containing beverages (i.e.
mainly absinthe) remain regulated [3]. This means that
Salvia officinalis and other thujone-containing flavour-
ing plants (besides Artemisia in beverages) can now be
used in foods without restrictions. Nevertheless, thujone
as such (i.e. in chemically pure form) is not allowed to
be added to foods; it may only be indirectly introduced
into foods by use of thujone-containing plants [3].

While the restrictions for foods have been lowered,
the opposite has occurred for herbal medicines. The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently imple-
mented an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5.0 mg/per-
son for a maximum duration of use of 2 weeks in their
Salvia officinalis monograph [4]. In a recent public
statement, the EMA has reacted to new scientific evi-
dence and now calls a range of exposure between 3 and
7 mg/day as acceptable without concern, while propos-
ing a new ADI of 6 mg/person [5].
These regulatory differences lead to the strange situa-
tion wherein basically the same product (sage tea) may
be marketed as food without any restriction, while its
marketing as medicine in drug stores and pharmacies
is regulated and certain warning labels are even
required, such as “sage preparations should not be
taken for more than 2 weeks” or “may impair ability to
drive and use machines”. In addition, its use by chil-
dren and adolescents under 18 years of age is not
recommended [4].
There is currently a scarcity of literature data regard-
ing the thujone content of sage products on the market.
For sage tea, our detailed literature review [1] detected
only one report based on actual analytical data of a sage
tea, which contained 2.0 μg/ml of thujone (2 g of dried
plant material in 150 ml boiling water, steeped for 5
min), corresponding to 0.3 mg per cup [6]. Only 2.99%
of essential oils were extracted during the preparation of
such a tea [7]. The EMA [4] provided model calcula-
tions based on analytical data on essential oil yield and
essential oil composition of Salvia officinalis folium
using results from the study conducted by Länger et al.
[8]. For an amount of 1 g sage leaves per 150-ml cup of
hot water, the EMA assumed a thujone content ranging
between 0.7 mg and 5.0 mg per cup, based on 3% essen-
tial oil containing 10-60% a-thujone and 4-36% b-thu-
jone and 17.6% extraction during tea steeping. This
model calculation therefore led to a higher thujone con-
tent in a cup of sage tea than in the analytical data. We
previously warned against model calculations based on
essential oil analyses in the context of thujone estima-
tion in absinthe [9]. Similar to wormwood, the thujone
content in sage is highly variable. Typically, three che-
motypes with low (9%), medium (22-28%), and high (39-
44%) thujone contents are differentiated [10]. Thujone
content also depends on drying conditions [11], harvest
time and seasonal variation [10,12,13], geographic and
climatic conditions [14,15] and fertilization [16], and it
shows a gradient even inside a single individuum [17].
Sample preparation using steam distillation or solvent
extraction may also have an influence [8]. The relative
amount of essential oil constituents may also change
during aqueous extraction due to the different solubili-
ties: e.g. Lima et al. [7] reported 17.4% a-thujone in the
essential oil, but 34.0% was contained in the essential oil
fraction extracted from sage tea. While methods for the
reduction of thujone in pharmaceutical preparations
appear to be available [18], this practice may be in viola-
tion of the ISO 9909 standard, which specifies a range
of 18.0-43.0% of a-thujone and 3.0-8.5% of b-thujone
[19]. The European Pharmacopoeia also requires that
sage leaf oil is “rich” in thujone, however without speci-
fying a range [20].
For these reasons, we think that only actual analytical
data are sufficient for risk assessment of thujone in sage
products. To fill this void in the literature, this study
provides an analytical methodology based on our pre-
viously validated GC/MS procedure for analysing thu-
jone in alcoholic beverages [21]. We also included
camphor in the quantitative analysis, as this substance
may also be health-relevant according to EMA [4]. The
procedure was then applied to analyse a large sample
collective (n = 86) of sage foods and medicines.
Experimental
Samples and sample preparation
Sage-containing foods and medicines were purchased
between March and July 2010 in wholesale and retail
supermarkets, drug stores, health food shops and phar-
macies. We aimed to gather all available products and
brands and therefore backordered further items at a
pharmaceutical wholesale outlet. For several items, we
ordered more than one package in order to gather data
on charge variations. The sampling can be seen as
representative for the current trade with sage products
on the German market.
For sage tea, infusions were generally prepared accord-
ing to the standard protocol specified in DIN 10809/ISO
3103 [22]. A 150-mL white porcelain pot with lid was
used. Deviating from the standard protocol, (which is
for Camellia sinensis based tea), we used 1.5 g of herbal
tea material (or 1 tea bag) instead of 2.0 g per cup, as
this more realistically conforms to the specification as
prescribed by the manufacturer on the labelling. In gen-
eral, the tea material was infused in 150 mL of hot
water for 15 min. For comparison purposes, the same
infusion was made using ethanol (60% vol) instead of
water. To further study the influences of tea prepara-
tion, one of the samples was extracted using different
alcoholic strengths (0, 25, 60, 75 and 99% vol) at two
different temperatures (20°C and 80°C). The aqueous
and alcoholic infusions were then directly used for
extraction. Because the act of the tea preparation might
also have an influence, 10 different teas were prepared
with the lid of the pot either opened or closed. As a
final experiment, the thujone extraction was studied
during infusion in two brands by multiple samplings
during 0 to 15 min infusion time.

For liquid products (medicinal sage extracts and tinc-
tures), the product was diluted into the required con-
centration with ethanol (60% vol), typically 1:50 or
1:100. Solid products (sage sweets/candy) were homoge-
nized in a laboratory mill and 10 g were dissolved in
ethanol (60% vol) under ultrasonication and mild warm-
ing. Fresh and dried sage plants (sold as spice) were pre-
pared by homogenization of 30 g of plant material in
250 mL of ethanol (60% vol). The resulting solution was
filtrated and diluted into the required concentration
(typically 1:50). All products were analyzed as is without
physical alteration, i.e. in the form to be used by consu-
mers. No drying steps (e.g. for the fresh products) were
conducted and all results refer to fresh weight.
The extraction of the prepared solutions (i.e. the aqu-
eous tea infusion as well as the homogenized or diluted
solutions in the case of other products) was accom-
plished using a previously described procedure for the
determination of thujone in alcoholic beverages [21],
which was extended for the analysis of camphor. The
procedure was based on the liquid-liquid-extraction
with 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane first proposed
by Rapp et al. [23]. After the addition of 350 μL of
cyclodecanone as internal standard (freshly prepared
methanolic solution, 20 μg/mL), 1 mL of the sample
was shaken with 10 mL of ethanol (15% vol) and 1 mL
of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane for 60 s and cen-
trifuged at 3.000 rpm for 5 min for phase separation.
The lower organic phase was drawn off using a transfer-
pettor and filled in a GC vial. For calibration, thujone
and camphor solutions (0.1-80 mg/L) were freshly pre-
pared in ethanol (15% vol) and extracted as the samples.
The organic extracts were stored at 4°C until analysis.
GC-MS measurement of thujone and camphor
The GC-MS system used for analysis was an Agilent
model 6890 Series Plus gas chromatograph in combina-
tion with a CTC Combi PAL autosampler and an Agi-
lent 5973N mass selective detector. Data acquisition and
analysis were performed using standard software sup-
plied by the manufacturer. Substances were separated
on a fused silica capillary column (HP-Innowax, 60 m ×
0.25 mm I.D., film thickness 0.25 μm). Temperature
program: 45°C hold for 1 min, 5°C/min up to 180°C, 25°
C/min up to 240°C, hold for 5 min. The temperatures
for the injection port, ion source, quadrupole and inter-
face were set at 240°C, 230°C, 150°C, and 250°C, respec-
tively. Split/splitless injection port (1 μL, splitless) and
helium with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min as carrier gas
were used.
To determine the retention times and characteristic
mass fragments, electron impact (EI) mass spectra of
the analytes were recorded by total ion monitoring. The
analytes a-thujone, b-thujone, and camphor, as well as
the internal standard cyclodecanone were baseline sepa-
rated. The retention times were 20.75 min for camphor,
18.29 min for a-thujone, 18.78 min for b-thujone, and
26.36 min for cyclodecanone. For quantitative analysis,
the chosen diagnostic mass fragments were monitored
in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Camphor:
m/z 108 as target ion and m/z 109, 152 as qualifier ions;
a-/b-thujone: m/z 110 as target ion and m/z 81 and 152
as qualifier ions; cyclodecanone: m/z 111 as target ion
and m/z 98 and 154 as qualifier ions. For quantification,
peak area ratios of the analytes to the internal standard
were calculated as a function of the concentration of the
substances. The limit of detection was 0.08 mg/L [21]
for thujone and 0.02 mg/L for camphor. For further
validation of the method, quality control samples were
prepared and analysed using the procedure described
above. Precision and recovery were determined with and
without sample preparation. The data with sample pre-
paration were gathered by analysing several different
packages of the same batch.
Total polyphenolic content expressed as Folin-Ciocalteu
Index
All phenolic compounds contained in the sample were
oxidized by Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) reagent. This reagent
is formed from a mixture of phosphotungstic acid,
H3PW12O40, and phosphomolybdic acid, H3PMo12O40,
which, after oxidation of the phenols, is reduced to a
mixture of blue oxides of tungsten, W8O23, and molyb-
denum, Mo8O23. The blue colouration produced has a
maximum absorption in the region of 750 nm and is
proportional to the total quantity of phenolic com-
pounds originally present. The FC-Index was deter-
mined according to the reference procedure for wine
analysis [24] using a commercial FC reagent (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany, No. 1.09001.0100). To prepare the
samples, 200 μL of sage tea (from the infusion described
above), 10 mL of distilled water, 1 mL of FC reagent,
and 4 ml of sodium carbonate solution (20%, m/v) were
placed into a calibrated 20 mL flask and filled up to the
mark with distilled water. After a period of 30 min
required for stabilization of the blue colour formed, the
absorbance at 750 nm was measured. The result is
expressed in the form of an index obtained by multiply-
ing the absorbance by 20.
Results and Discussion
Method development and validation
We were able to transfer our previous procedure
intended for alcoholic beverages to sage foods and med-
icines. Sage teas could be treated in a similar manner as
alcoholic beverages. Sage tinctures and extracts sold as
medicines only needed to be diluted into the calibration
range. Only for solid foods was a further preparation

step necessary to get the terpenes (a- and b-thujone,
camphor) into solution, to be used for liquid-liquid-
extraction. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the
extraction yield from the plant material during sage tea
preparation, and we therefore conducted an extraction
experiment, with results shown in Figure 1. Up to 60%
vol of alcohol, the extraction yield is considerably
increased, while it remains constant if the alcoholic
strength is further increased. The purely aqueous extrac-
tion (0% vol alcohol) yielded approximately 25% of the
maximum yield. The extraction also depends on the
temperature. Camphor shows the same extraction beha-
viour as thujone (data not shown). Because of these
results, we extracted solid foods using 60% vol ethanol
and made all dilutions using this alcoholic strength. Our
result also confirms the observation in alcoholic bev-
erages (absinthe) that the optimal strength is above 60%
vol, while at lower strength the essential oils precipitate
(which is sometimes desired in certain drinking rituals)
[25].
For sage food and medicines, an extractive sample
preparation appeared to be obligatory, as the initial
extracts are heavily coloured and would lead to matrix
interferences as well as contamination of the GC inlet
liner and MS ion source. Similar to our previous proce-
dure, we therefore used a liquid-liquid extraction, which
is comparably fast and easy to conduct. 1,1,2-Trichloro-
1,2,2-trifluoroethane has the highest extraction efficiency
of flavour compounds from alcoholic solutions (see e.g.
[21,23,26,27]). The advantage is that a complete extrac-
tion is reached in only one step, and we further con-
trolled the extraction efficiency by applying an internal
standard before the extraction and conducting extrac-
tion of all calibration samples. All analytes and the
internal standard were baseline separated. A typical
chromatogram is shown in Figure 2. The validation
results are presented in Table 1. The calibration curves
were constructed from peak areas using the SIM mode,
and they show a linear relationship for a- and b-thujone
and camphor with coefficients of correlation of 0.999.
The linear range between 0.1 and 80 mg/L covers the
thujone concentrations typically found in sage teas.
Other products can be measured by dilution into this
range. To improve quantitative analysis of essential oil
compounds, the use of an internal standard was sug-
gested [28]. In our case, we applied cyclodecanone,
which was proposed by Kröner et al. [29,30] for the
determination of thujone in absinthe. As we add the
internal standard in the first step of the sample prepara-
tion process, not only changes during chromatography
but also during extraction (e.g. due to differences in
ethanol content for the herbal medicines) are corrected.
In general, excellent precision was achieved, with ranges
between 0.2 to 0.7% (without sample preparation) and
0.8 to 12.6% (including sample preparation). The recov-
eries of spiked samples were between 93.7 and 104.0%
(average 99.1%).
Influence of preparation conditions on thujone contents
in sage tea
During the brewing time, the increase of thujone and
camphor showed an almost linear behaviour up to
about 5 min, after which saturation was reached (Fig-
ure 3). If risk assessments show that the exposure to
thujone should be minimized, the consumer recommen-
dation could be to reduce the infusion time, e.g. to
about 3 min instead of 15 min. The behaviour of the
extraction of polyphenols (i.e. the FC-Index), however,
was almost similar in this case to that of the terpenes.
The disadvantage of a reduced infusion time is, there-
fore, that the polyphenols (which are often attributed
for the beneficial effects of sage [6]) are similarly
reduced. A dependency between thujone and polyphe-
nols in tea was also confirmed in our survey (Table 2),
which proves significant positive linear correlations
between FC-Index and a-thujone (R = 0.60, p < 0.001)
and b-thujone (R = 0.67, p < 0.0001). However, this was
not the case between FC-Index and camphor (R = 0.16,
p = 0.39).
Interestingly, in the alcohol experiment (Figure 1),
the extraction of the polyphenols did not exhibit the
same behaviour as that of the terpenes. Approximately
80% of polyphenols are extracted without alcohol,
Figure 1 Extraction recovery of thujone and FC-Index
using different alcoholic strengths at different temperatures
(camphor exhibited exactly the same behaviour as thujone -
data not shown).

whereas thujone is only at 25% (Figure 1). The poly-
phenols are only slightly increased up to 60%, and
then decrease again. This is a first indication that the
common aqueous preparation of a sage tea is prefer-
able, as thujone is already avoided, while the polyphe-
nols are still extracted at a very high degree. This
was confirmed by our survey showing an average
extraction of 30% thujone (range 14-48%) in aqueous
tea preparations compared to extraction with 60%
ethanol (Table 2).
Finally, there were assumptions that the thujone con-
tent of sage tea could be higher if the tea was prepared
using a lid on the pot. This could have two effects: (1)
reduced evaporation and (2) increased extraction by
reduced temperature decline over the infusion time. In
our judgment, the first effect could be minor due to
the comparably high boiling point of thujone (about
200°C, see Ref. [31]). From our 10 samples, which we
analysed both with and without lids, no clear trend was
detectable. The half of the samples without lids had
higher contents and the other half had lower contents.
The average content with lid was 0.3 mg/L higher than
without lid, which is not a significant difference con-
sidering the precision of the method (ANOVA p =
0.92). This clearly disproves the hypothesis of a consid-
erable effect of using a lid: therefore, no consumer
recommendation is needed regarding the brewing
method.
Occurrence of thujone and camphor in sage tea
We analyzed 39 herbal teas, of which 8 brands were
sold as food and 31 products were sold as medicines (14
different brands). In general, in both product groups a
comparably wide variance of results was detected, which

confirmed the studies mentioned in the introduction
[10-17]. This was further researched by looking at only
one brand from which 18 different lots and product
types (including tea bags) were analysed (Table 2). This
confirms the high natural differences, as the total thu-
jone contents in this single brand varied from 12.4 mg/
L to 30.1 mg/L. The products sold as medicine had a
tendency to higher thujone contents (sum of a- and b-
thujone) from 0.2 to 30.1 mg/L (average 11.3 mg/L),
and camphor contents from 2.3 to 55 mg/L (average
25.4), while the ones sold as food contained 0.2 to 14.1
mg/L thujone (average 4.4 mg/L) and 1.5 to 43.8 mg/L
camphor (average 16.7 mg/L). The differences between
foods and medicines are statistically significant on the
5% level for the thujones (ANOVA: a-thujone p =
0.022; b-thujone p = 0.012) but not for camphor
(ANOVA p = 0.349) and FC-Index (ANOVA p = 0.409).
The statistical comparison is, of course, restricted by the
low sample size: however, all products available on the
German market at the time of sampling were included.
To finally confirm that there is in fact a difference
between food and medicine products, a larger Europe-
wide sampling needs to be conducted.
The explanation for the higher thujone contents in
medicines than in foods could be twofold: on one hand,
the European Pharmacopoeia [20] specifies minimum
contents of essential oil for sage leaf drugs and also
states the characteristic that “sage leaf oil is rich in thu-
jone”. A qualitative thin-layer chromatography test for
thujone is also included in the identification assays spe-
cified in the Pharmacopoeia [20]. On the other hand,
previous EU legislation [2] had specified a maximum
thujone content of 25 mg/kg in food containing sage (in
the final product ready for consumption). It can be
speculated that food producers previously selected low-
thujone varieties (i.e. the low-thujone chemotype), while
medicine producers selected oil- and thujone-rich vari-
eties (i.e. the medium and high chemotypes) to fulfil the
Pharmacopoeia demands. As mentioned in the introduc-
tion, it must be stressed that in the newest amendment
of the EU flavouring laws [3], the limit for sage products
was omitted, so that currently no maximum limit for
food applies anymore. This might lead to rising contents
in the future, as no legislative pressure may exist any-
more to select the low-thujone chemotypes, which may
now be substituted by other selection criteria such as
price and quality.
Regarding the exposure assessment from tea, the lit-
erature has described thujone contents of 0.3 mg per
cup [1], and EMA has estimated a thujone content of
0.7 to 5 mg per cup from the data of Länger [7]. The
analysed food teas (n = 8) showed a thujone content
ranging from 0.03 to 2.14 mg per cup and a camphor
content of 0.23 to 6.57 mg per cup. The analysed med-
icinal teas (n = 31) showed thujone contents ranging
from 0.03 to 4.56 mg thujone per cup and 0.35 to 8.25
mg camphor per cup. Although our results confirmed
the range previously made in estimations by EMA, our
data show that the maximum content of thujone per
cup of tea is actually lower than assumed by EMA.
The situation for camphor is different. EMA estimated
a camphor content of 0.53 to 2.3 mg of camphor per
cup. Our results show that the actual content is up to
three times higher for products sold as food and up to
four times higher for products sold as medicines.
Occurrence of thujone and camphor in other sage
products
As expected, we found the highest contents of terpenes
in the fresh sage samples (n = 5), ranging from 223 mg/
kg to 1901 mg/kg for thujone and from 821 to 2610
mg/kg for camphor. Dried sage leaves sold as food
ingredients (n = 3) showed a thujone content of 944 to
1353 mg/kg and a camphor content of 1651 to 4322

mg/kg. Candies (n = 4) contained 3.3 to 8 mg/kg thu-
jone and 87.3 to 312 mg/kg camphor (Table 3).
Apart from the teas, we also analysed various medi-
cines containing sage (Table 4). Overall they showed
thujone content ranging from not detectable to 492 mg/
L. Interestingly, in the analysed sage juices (n = 3),
neither thujone nor camphor were detectable. Therefore,
the question arises as to which part of Salvia was used
in the preparation of these products, or if any part of it
was used at all. In light of our extraction experiments
and literature data [18], tinctures (or alcoholic extracts)
expectedly showed thujone contents from 135 to 492
mg/L and camphor contents of 203 to 883 mg/L higher
than aqueous formulations.
Finally, we analysed semi-solid formulations for use in
the mouth (such as teething gel or gum gel) (n = 4).
The analysed thujone content ranged from 35.3 to 335
mg/kg. So-called herbal sedative tinctures had thujone
contents ranging from not detectable to 18.3 mg/kg.
Notably, tablets (antispirant tablets, see Table 4) with
the indicated traditional use to reduce sweating, showed
the lowest thujone concentrations of 0.2 to 3.7 mg/kg.
We analysed 3 different brands (Table 4). Two brands
(brand 1 and 2) contained dry extract of Salvia gained
by aqueous extraction. We did not find detectable
amounts of thujone or camphor in these preparations.
The information provided by the manufacturer states
that the tablets contain 80 mg (brand 1) and 300 mg
(brand 2) of a dried extract of Salvia obtained by an
aqueous extraction. Therefore, a low content of thujone
can be expected. Brand 3 claims to use crushed dried
sage leaves (200 mg per tablet). We analysed a thujone
content of 3.7 mg/kg. This means that every single
tablet (weight: 0.45 g) contains 0.0016 mg of thujone.
Calculating tablet and recommended daily dose (3 × 1-2
tablets) shows that with a daily dose of 6 tablets the
consumer would take up 0.0096 mg of thujone per day,
which is considerably less than the exposure from tea.
Of course, the question arises about the possible active

compounds in such applications. In this case, the results
of the FC-Index hint that other compounds are active
substances in the formulation, probably the polyphenols,
which are also extractable to some degree by water.
Conclusions
The legal status of thujone products when sold as food
and when sold as medicines is considerably different.
While standards for foods have been in existence for
several decades, acceptable daily thujone intakes for
medicines were only recently proposed by the EMA [4].
By using the data of the National Toxicology Program
and a BMDL-ADI approach, Lachenmeier and Uebe-
lacker [1] proposed a limit of 6.6 mg/day. EMA reacted
with a public statement reconsidering the published
ADI and proposing a new ADI in a similar region of 6
mg/day [5]. This means that up to 6 cups of average
food sage tea or up to 3 cups of average medicinal sage
could be ingested daily without reaching this intake
level. Therefore, we currently see no risk associated with
the occasional food or medicinal use of sage (especially
in the traditional use as herbal tea). The collection of
data concerning sage preparations should be expanded
in the future, preferably compounded by a quantitative
risk-benefit analysis.
