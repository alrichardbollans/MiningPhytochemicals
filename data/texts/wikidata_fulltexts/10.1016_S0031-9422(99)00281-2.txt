Anthocyanins in blue berries of Vaccinium padifoliumLuis Cabrita, Øyvind M. Andersen*Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Alle´gt. 41, 5007 Bergen, NorwayReceived 16 December 1998; received in revised form 26 February 1999; accepted 3 March 1999AbstractTwenty anthocyanins were isolated from the extract of the edible blue berries of Vaccinium padifolium (Uveira) by acombination of chromatographic techniques. Mainly on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques (1H, COSY,TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, SEFT) they were identified as the 3-O-b-glucopyranosides, 3-O-b-galactopyranosides, 3-O-b-arabinopyranosides and 3-O-sambubiosides (20-O-b-xylopyranosyl-O-b-glucopyranosides) of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin,malvidin and peonidin. Anthocyanidin disaccharides have not been identified in the genus Vaccinium previously, and the 3-sambubiosides of peonidin, petunidin and malvidin are novel compounds. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

IntroductionThe genus Vaccinium in the family Ericaceae com-prises about 200 species. Some species have ediblefruits of economic importance. In the last decades theanthocyanin content of some Vaccinium species, es-pecially V. myrtillus, has received interest due to theirpharmacological properties, in particular eect onblood vessels and in ophthalmology (Morazzoni &Bombardelli, 1996) and potential inhibition of HIVvirus (Andersen & Helland, 1995). From a chemotaxo-nomic point of view it has been suggested that thegenus Vaccinium may be characterised by the generalpresence in its fruits of 3-monoglycosides in which theaglycones delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, malvidinand peonidin are combined with the sugars galactose,arabinose and glucose (Ballinger, Galetta & Mannes,1979). Many Vaccinium spp. have later been found tocontain some or all of these anthocyanins. However,the repertoire has been extended by the identificationof the 3-arabinoside and 3-galactoside of pelargonidinin berries of V. japonicum (Andersen, 1987) and the 3-acetylglucoside and 3-acetylgalactoside of malvidin inV. angustifolium (Gao & Mazza, 1995).Vaccinium padifolium is a deciduous shrub endemicto Madeira island (Portugal). Its berries have beenused as food preserves and in local ethnopharmacol-ogy (cough, colds, bronchitis, dysentery) (Rivera &Obo´n, 1995) and exported for commercial productionof ophthalmic specialities (Vieira, 1992). Its pigmentcontent has previously not been reported, and the aimof this study is to present its complex anthocyanincontent, including the first anthocyanidin disaccharidesfrom this genus among which three are novel.2. Results and discussionThe acidified methanolic extract obtained from V.padifolium berries contained a range of anthocyanins(Fig. 1). This extract was partitioned against ethylacetate, washed on an Amberlite XAD-7 column, andchromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column. Pureanthocyanins were finally obtained after semi-prepara-tive reverse-phase HPLC. The collected fractions weremonitored by TLC and analytical HPLC.

Andersen).3-O-glucosides, 3-O-galactosides and 3-O-arabinosidesof delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and mal-vidin were identified on the basis of UV–VIS spectraldata and cochromatography (TLC and HPLC) withknown anthocyanins from V. myrtillus (Table 1).The low-field part of the 1H NMR spectrum of 9showed six resonances (see Table 2). On the basis ofchemical shifts and coupling-patterns the signals of theAX system at d 7.83 and 7.92 were assigned to H2 ’and H6 ’, respectively, while the 3H AMX system at d6.96, 6.72 and 9.01 were assigned to H-8, H-6 and H-4, respectively. The HMBC spectrum of 9 showedcrosspeaks between H4/C8 (d 9.0/94.3), H6/C4 (d 6.6/135.4) and H8/C4 (d 6.9/135.4). Together with the 3Hsinglet at d 4.08 (OMe), which in the HMBC spec-trum correlated with C3 ’ (d 4.1/148.9), these assign-ments confirmed the identity of the aglycone to bepetunidin.The anomeric proton signals in the 1H NMR spec-trum of 9 appear considerably downfield for the othersugar resonances, and thus the two doublets at d 5.56and 4.78 together with the integration data defined thepeonidin:sugar:sugar ratio as 1:1:1. Starting from thedoublet at d 4.78 (H-11) the observed crosspeak withthe signal at d 3.24 in the DQF-COSY permittedassignment of H-21. The chain of coupled protons, H-21, H-31, H-41, H-51A and H-51B, was thereafterassigned after a sequential ‘walk’ in the same spectrum(Table 2). Subsequently the chemical shifts of the cor-responding carbon atoms (Table 3) were assigned fromthe HSQC experiment, which together with the large1H–1H coupling constants (Table 2) agreed with all theprotons axial in a b-linked xylopyranoside. On thebasis of a combination of COSY, TOCSY, HSQC,HMBC and SEFT NMR spectra it was possible toassign all the proton (Table 2) and carbon (Table3) resonances of the other sugar moiety, which wasdetermined to be a b-glucopyranoside. The cross-peak at d 5.6/145.3 (H-10/C-3) in the HMBC spec-trum revealed that this sugar was linked to theaglycone 3-position. The high-field position of theanomeric proton of the xylose unit (d 4.78) indi-cated a sugar–sugar linkage. The pronounced down-field shift of C-20 (d 82.25) compared to theanalogous C-20 signal of for instance the corre-sponding signal of 7 (d 74.80) (Andersen, Aksnes,Nerdal & Johansen, 1991), indicated that the xylosylresidue was connected to C-20 of the glucose ring.This linkage was confirmed by the crosspeak at d4.8/81.0 in the HMBC spectrum between H-11 andC-20. Thus, the identity of 9 was found to be petu-nidin 3-O-(20-O-b-xylopyranosyl-b-glucopyranoside),petunidin 3-O-sambubioside.The proton and carbon shifts of 2, 6, 14 and 17(Tables 2 and 3) were assigned by the same one- andtwo-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NMR tech-niques as used for 9. They were found to contain thesame sugar (3-sambubioside) and the correspondingaglycones were in accordance with delphinidin, cyani-din, peonidin and malvidin, respectively. Cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside, 6, was also cochromatographed(HPLC and TLC) against authentic pigment isolatedfrom Sambucus nigra (Andersen et al., 1991).Anthocyanidin disaccharides have not been identifiedin the genus Vaccinium previously, and the 3-sambu-biosides of petunidin (9), peonidin (14) and malvidin(17) are novel compounds.Fig. 1.

V. made-neuse) were collected in Madeira island (Portugal) inOctober 1995 and stored at ÿ208C. The berries (100 g)were extracted 10 times with 100 ml MeOH containing1% TFA. The combined extract was filtered, concen-trated under reduced pressure, partitioned againstethyl acetate, and applied on an Amberlite XAD-7 col-umn. The dried extract (1.0 g) was fractionated by aSephadex LH-20 column (1000  50 mm) using a stepelution with 20–60% MeOH–H2O (0.1% TFA).Fractions were further separated by semi-preparativeHPLC.3.2. ChromatographyHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)was performed on a HP-1050 module system (HewlettPackard) using an ODS Hypersil column (200  4.6mm, 5 mm) and diode array detection. Two solventswere used for elution: A, HCO2H–H2O (1:9, v/v); B,MeOH–HCO2H–H2O (5:1:4, v/v). The elution profilewas 0–4 min, 10% B in A (isocratic); 4–21 min, 10–100% B in A (linear gradient), 100% B (isocratic). Theflow rate was 1.2 ml minÿl. Prior to injection allsamples were filtered through a 0.45 mm Milliporemembrane filter. Thin layer chromatography was car-ried out on microcrystalline cellulose F (Merck, art.5556) with the solvents 1-BuOH–HOAc–H2O (4:1:5,upper phase) and HCO2H–conc. HCl–H2O (1:1:2).3.3.

When the UV–VISabsorption spectra were measured in 0.01% HCl–MeOH, the following lVis.max (nm) and A440/AVis.max(%) data were obtained for the five anthocyanidin 3-sambubiosides: 2, 540 nm (18%); 6, 530 nm (23%); 9,538 nm (19%); 14, 526 nm (29%); 17, 536 nm (24%).Spectral measurements were made over the wavelengthrange 240–600 nm in steps of 2 nm. The relative quan-titative data were based on the average values of theabsorptions on every second nm between 500 and 540nm, without taking into account the dierent molarabsorption coecients of the pigments. The NMR ex-periments (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC,SEFT) were obtained at 600.13 MHz and 150.92 MHzfor 1H and 13C, respectively, on a Bruker DRX-600instrument at 258C. The deuteriomethyl 13C signal andthe residual 1H signal of the solvent (CF3CO2D–CD3OD; 5:95, v/v) were used as secondary references(d 49.0 and 3.4 from TMS, respectively).AcknowledgementsLC is grateful to Mr Victor Freitas (Univ.
