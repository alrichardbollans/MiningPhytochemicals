Germi-nation assays in the presence of abamine, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, revealedthat the effect of SA on germination was in fact caused by a concomitant stimulationof ABA biosynthesis. In order to distinguish whether the plastid or the nuclear isoformof WHIRLY1 is adjusting the responsiveness toward ABA, sequences encoding either thecomplete WHIRLY1 protein or a truncated form lacking the plastid transit peptide wereoverexpressed in the why1 mutant background. In plants overexpressing the full-lengthsequence, WHIRLY1 accumulated in both plastids and the nucleus, whereas in plants over-expressing the truncated sequence, WHIRLY1 accumulated exclusively in the nucleus.Seedlings containing recombinant WHIRLY1 in both compartments were hypersensitivetoward ABA. In contrast, seedlings possessing only the nuclear form of WHIRLY1 were asinsensitive toward ABA as the why1 mutants. ABA was furthermore shown to lower therate of germination of wildtype seeds even in the presence of abamine which is knownto inhibit the formation of xanthoxin, the plastid located precursor of ABA. From this weconclude that plastid locatedWHIRLY1 enhances the responsiveness of seeds toward ABAeven when ABA is supplied exogenously.Keywords: abscisic acid, abamine, Arabidopsis, dual localization, gun, plastid signaling, salicylic acid,WHIRLY1INTRODUCTIONWHIRLY1 is a DNA binding protein shown to be located bothin chloroplasts and the nucleus and to have the same molecu-lar weight in both compartments (Grabowski et al., 2008). Afterits synthesis on 80S ribosomes, WHIRLY1 is targeted to chloro-plasts where it is processed by cleavage of an N-terminal plastidtransit peptide (PTP). The functionality of the PTP has beenshown before by subcellular detection of a WHIRLY1:GFP fusionprotein and by import assays (Krause et al., 2005). Recently, ithas been shown that recombinant hemagglutinin (HA)-taggedWHIRLY1 synthesized in plastids of transplastomic tobacco plantsis translocated to the nucleus where it activates transcription ofpathogen response (PR) genes (Isemer et al., 2012). This suggeststhat WHIRLY1 is sequestered in plastids before it gets translocatedto the nucleus to adjust gene expression (Krause and Krupinska,2009). Although the stimuli that lead to its translocation are stillunknown, this feature makes WHIRLY1 an ideal candidate fortransducing information from plastids to the nucleus.The plastid and the nuclear isoforms of WHIRLY1 were shownto be responsible for diverse unique functions in the two com-partments. Plastid located WHIRLY1 has been found in stromafractions and additionally was shown to associate with plastidDNA (Pfalz et al., 2006; Majeran et al., 2012) and with plastidRNA (Prikryl et al., 2008; Melonek et al., 2010). WHIRLY1 fromArabidopsis thaliana has been implicated in plastid genome repair,assigning the protein an important role in maintaining plastidgenome stability (Maréchal et al., 2009; Cappadocia et al., 2010).This plastid specific function of WHIRLY1 is also accomplishedby WHIRLY3, the second member of the WHIRLY protein familythat can be found in plastids (Maréchal et al., 2009; Cappadociaet al., 2010). Furthermore, WHIRLY1 was shown to promote thesplicing of intron containing plastid encoded RNAs in maize andbarley (Prikryl et al., 2008; Melonek et al., 2010). The nuclear formof WHIRLY1 has been implicated in PR reactions in potato as wellas in A. thaliana (Desveaux et al., 2000, 2004, 2005). Transcrip-tional activation of PR genes by WHIRLY1 was reported to dependon salicylic acid (SA; Desveaux et al., 2000, 2004). SA is the onlyplant hormone which is completely and exclusively synthesizedinside plastids (Wildermuth et al., 2001). Besides its well-knownroles in pathogen defense signaling, it has many other functionsin addition. For example, SA has been implicated in acclimationto high light and in regulation of the redox homeostasis (Mateoet al., 2006; Mühlenbock et al., 2008).In recent years, plastids as sites of SA biosynthesis have also beenimplicated in perception of pathogens and in innate immunity(Padmanabhan and Dinesh-Kumar, 2010). For example, elicitorsof the bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae were pre-dicted to localize to chloroplasts (Guttman et al., 2002). In tobaccowww.frontiersin.org December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 1Isemer et al. Plastid WHIRLY1 mediates ABA signalingplants infected by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) the chloroplastlocated protein N-receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) wasshown to mediate innate immunity. Even more interestingly, thechloroplast protein is recruited by a viral effector to the cytoplasmand nucleus (Caplan et al., 2008) indicating that redistribution ofregulatory proteins from chloroplasts to the nucleus is involvedin plant responses toward pathogens. Very recently, changes inthe level of calcium within plastids and formation of singlet oxy-gen were shown to precede the stimulation of SA biosynthesis inresponse to pathogens (Nomura et al., 2012).With regard to its formation inside plastids, SA could be thetrigger inducing the translocation of WHIRLY1 from plastids tothe nucleus. Such a mechanism would be in accordance with themodel on WHIRLY1 activation during pathogen defense proposedby Brisson and co-workers (Desveaux et al., 2000, 2005). Thismodel suggested that an inactive pool of WHIRLY1 is activatedupon an increase in the level of SA and thus is able to bind to pro-moters of PR genes. It is feasible that the WHIRLY1 pool, whichis inactive with regard to activation of the target genes, is identicalwith the subset of plastid located WHIRLY1.Salicylic acid has also been found to be involved in regulation ofplant development. In Arabidopsis, the level of SA is highly elevatedduring early seedling development (Preston et al., 2009) whichmight be related to the proposed role of SA in establishing defensemechanisms during germination (Rajjou et al., 2006). Applicationof SA was shown to inhibit germination and it has been pro-posed that this inhibitory effect is due to a concomitant increasein ABA (Rajjou et al., 2006) as measurements in wheat seedlingssuggested (Shakirova et al., 2003). The stimulation of ABA syn-thesis might occur inside plastids, which harbor the key enzymeof ABA biosynthesis, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED)that converts carotenoids into xanthoxin. Xanthoxin leaves theplastid and is converted to ABA in the cytosol (Cutler et al., 2010;Seo and Koshiba, 2011). Indeed, plants deficient in accumulationof SA were also shown to have lower levels of ABA making itdifficult to analyze the effects of one or the other hormone origi-nating from plastids separately (Abreu and Munné-Bosch, 2009).Accumulating evidence suggests that ABA is associated with plas-tid signaling. Indeed, ABA responsive cis-elements (ABREs) havebeen found in the promoters of many target genes of plastid sig-nals (Rook et al., 2006; Koussevitzky et al., 2007). Moreover, thetranscription factor ABI4, which was first described in connec-tion with ABA insensitivity (Finkelstein, 1994), was shown to becommon to different pathways of plastid signaling. Accordingly,the abi4 mutant was found to be insensitive toward plastid signalsproduced during conditions of impaired chloroplast development(Koussevitzky et al., 2007).In this study we analyzed the impact of WHIRLY1 on theresponsiveness of seeds toward the plastid originating hormonesSA and ABA during germination. WHIRLY1 T-DNA insertionmutants (why1) of Arabidopsis were shown to be insensitive towardSA as well as ABA. When the biosynthesis of ABA was inhibitedby abamine known to prevent formation of the ABA precursorxanthoxin, SA had no effect on germination. This showed thatSA only indirectly affects seedling development by stimulationof ABA biosynthesis. Opposite to the mutants and to trans-genic plants accumulating WHIRLY1 exclusively in the nucleus,transgenic plants accumulating WHIRLY1 in both plastids andthe nucleus showed hypersensitivity toward ABA during germi-nation. To conclude, our data indicate that WHIRLY1 enhancesthe responsiveness of seeds toward ABA only when it is located inthe plastids. The plastid located precursor of ABA, xanthoxin, isnot involved in this response, because germination was inhibitedby external ABA also in the presence of the biosynthesis inhibitorabamine.MATERIALS AND METHODSPLANT MATERIAL AND GROWTH CONDITIONSPlants of A. thaliana, ecotype Columbia, were grown under con-trolled conditions at 21˚C with 13 h of illumination at a lightintensity of 100 µmol photons s−1 m−2. Under these conditionsplants developed flowers within 8–9 weeks and mature seedscould be harvested after 12–14 weeks. T-DNA insertion linesSalk_023713 (why1-1) and Salk_147680 (why1-2) for WHIRLY1(At1g14410) were purchased from NASC and the positions ofthe T-DNA insertions were confirmed by PCR with the primerssuggested by the T-DNA express tool of the SALK institute(http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html). The absence of theinitial ATG codon in the WHIRLY1 mRNA of why1-1 and why1-2, respectively, was shown by RT-PCR using the WHY1_fwd andWHY1_rvs primers. The ACTIN2 gene was amplified to showequal amounts of templates. All primer sequences are listed inTable A1 of the Appendix. The seeds of the gun1-1 and gun1-102 lines (Voigt et al., 2010) were a gift of Dario Leister. Theseeds of the gun5 line (Susek et al., 1993) were a gift of BernhardGrimm.GERMINATION ASSAYSArabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized as described before (Aron-sson and Jarvis, 2011) and put on full-strength Murashige andSkoog (MS) medium (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) con-taining 1.5% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) phyto agar (Duchefa,Haarlem, The Netherlands). After imbibition at 4˚C in the darkover night, plates were exposed to controlled growth condi-tions at 21˚C with 16 h of illumination at a light intensity of60 µmol photons s−1 m−2 for germination assays in the presenceof ABA. For germination assays in the presence of SA a neutral filterwas used to eliminate UV radiation from the light spectra whichreduced the light intensity to 30 µmol photons s−1 m−2. Seeds ofcomparable age and storage conditions were used and the sameamounts of medium were filled into the plates. To determine phe-notypical differences during germination, sterile seeds were puton rectangular plates standing upright and photographed everyday. The impact of phytohormones on germination was assayedas described (Choy et al., 2008). For preparation of stock solu-tions the sodium salt of SA (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)was dissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of 1 M. ABA(6 cis-trans; Sigma A1049, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)was first dissolved in 1 ml of 1 M NaOH and then diluted withsterile deionized water to a final stock concentration of 25 mM.Abamine (Han et al., 2004) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide toa final stock concentration of 130 mM. Twenty to 50 seeds eachwere plated on media containing the different compounds. SevenFrontiers in Plant Science | Plant Physiology December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 2Isemer et al. Plastid WHIRLY1 mediates ABA signalingdays after imbibition the number of seeds, where emerging radiclescould be observed with the naked eye, was determined.CONSTRUCTION OF TRANSGENIC LINES OVEREXPRESSING WHIRLY1The full-length coding sequence of AtWHIRLY1 and the truncatedAtWHIRLY1 sequence lacking the first 141 bp encoding the plas-tid transit peptide (PTP) were amplified by PCR using the cDNAU10139, cloned into pENTR/TOPO gateway vector and sequencedto verify PCR product sequences. The HA tag was included inframe in the sequence of the reverse primer. After transfer ofthe two different AtWHIRLY1 constructs into the binary desti-nation vector pB2GW7.0 (Karimi et al., 2002), why1-1 plants weretransformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated flowertransformation employing vacuum infiltration (Bechtold and Pel-letier, 1998). Successfully transformed plants were selected by theirresistance toward 0.1% (w/v) glufosinate ammonium (Basta, BayerCrop Science, Germany) which was applied by spraying.PREPARATION OF SUBCELLULAR FRACTIONS AND IMMUNOLOGICALGEL BLOT ANALYSESChloroplasts were prepared from leaves of 7-week-old Arabidop-sis plants and purified on percoll step gradients as described(Gruissem et al., 1986). Nuclear proteins were isolated fromfrozen leaves of 7-week-old Arabidopsis plants as described byBusk and Pagès (1997). Proteins were separated under dena-turing conditions on 14% (w/v) acrylamide gels, transferred tonitrocellulose membranes and immunodecorated using standardprotocols as described (Isemer et al., 2012). A monoclonal anti-body directed toward the HA tag was purchased from RocheDiagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies againstthe cytochrome b559 apoprotein A (Vallon et al., 1987) and RNApolymerase I (RNA POL-I; Agrisera,Vännäs, Sweden) respectively,were used to monitor the purity of the nuclear and chloroplastfractions.RESULTSCHARACTERIZATION OF TWO WHIRLY1 MUTANTS OF ARABIDOPSISTHALIANAPreviously, functions of WHIRLY1 have been connected with thephytohormone SA (Desveaux et al., 2000, 2004, 2005; Xiong et al.,2009). Therefore, the initial aim of this study was to investi-gate whether WHIRLY1 (At1g14410) plays a role in SA inducedinhibition of germination in Arabidopsis. For this purpose thetwo independent T-DNA insertion lines why1-1 (Salk_023713)and why1-2 (Salk_147680) were used. In the genomic DNA ofmutant why1-1 the T-DNA insertion was found to be locateddirectly after the starting codon ATG, whereas in the why1-2 lineit was found to be located 25 base pairs further downstream(Figure 1A). Homozygosity of why1-1 and why1-2, respectively,was shown by PCR (Figure 1B) with primers LP, RP, and LBa1as suggested by the T-DNA express tool of the SALK institute(http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html). In the mutants theLP-RP amplification product of the wildtype allele (approximately1050 bp, see Figure 1B) was not visible. Only the smaller amplifi-cate corresponding to the T-DNA insertion was visible, indicatingthat both mutant lines are indeed homozygous. The primers “fwd”and “rvs” spanning the AUG start codon, exon 1 and part of exon2 (see Figure 1A) were used to probe for the presence of WHIRLY1FIGURE 1 | Characterization of why1 mutants. (A) Scheme showingthe positions of T-DNA insertions in two independent mutant lines(why1-1 and why1-2) for the WHIRLY1 gene. The sites of the T-DNAinsertions are indicated by arrowheads. Additionally, the positions ofprimers used for homozygous screening (LP, LBa1, RP) and verification ofthe presence of the initial start codon ATG in the WHIRLY1 mRNA (fwd,rvs) are shown. (B) Genomic DNA derived from wildtype, why1-1 andwhy1-2 lines, respectively, was used to test for homozygosity of themutants by use of the primers shown in (A). (C) In order to detect thepresence of WHIRLY1 mRNA in the why1-1 and why1-2 lines,respectively, cDNA derived of the two mutant lines and wildtype (WT)and the primers shown in (A) were used in a RT-PCR. Primers specific forACTIN2 were used for loading controls. (D) Phenotype of the why1-1 andwhy1-2 mutants was compared to wildtype (WT) when grown understandard growth conditions. Six-week-old plants are shown. (E)Germination of why1-1 and why1-2 was compared to the wildtype (WT)under standard growth conditions. The phenotype of the seedlings wasmonitored 2–5 days after sowing (das).www.frontiersin.org December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 3Isemer et al. Plastid WHIRLY1 mediates ABA signalingmRNA. A 300-bp band corresponding to that region was detectedonly in wildtype plants whereas the control mRNA for ACTIN2was detectable in wildtype as well as in mutants (Figure 1C). Whencultivated under standard growth conditions the phenotypes ofwhy1-1 and why1-2 mutants were indistinguishable from the wild-type (Figures 1D,E). This observation was true for mature plants(Figure 1D) as well as for young seedlings inspected at differ-ent times after germination on agar plates containing MS medium(Figure 1E). These findings are in accordance with previous resultson the why1-1 and why1-2 mutant lines (formerly named KO-1and KO-2; Yoo et al., 2007).WHIRLY1 MUTANT SEEDS SHOW REDUCED RESPONSIVENESS TOSALICYLIC ACID AS WELL AS TO ABSCISIC ACIDGermination of Arabidopsis seeds is known to be inhibited by SA(Rajjou et al., 2006). In order to investigate whether this biologicalactivity of SA is dependent on WHIRLY1, the two independentWHIRLY1 T-DNA insertion mutants why1-1 and why1-2 weregerminated on agar medium in the presence of different concen-trations of SA ranging from 0.2 to 1 mM. For comparison, thesame experiment was performed with wildtype seeds. The germi-nation rate was scored 7 days after imbibition of seeds by assessingwith the naked eye the number of seeds with emerged radicles. Atconcentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 mM SA, germination of thewhy1 mutant seeds was 10–15% more efficient than of wildtypeseeds (Figure 2A). The most prominent alteration of germinationwas visible at a concentration of 1 mM, when the germination ratein the mutants was almost 40%, compared to an almost completefailure of the wildtype to germinate (Figure 2A).External addition of SA to barley seeds was found to inducea transient increase in the level of abscisic acid (ABA; Shakirovaet al., 2003), and the inhibitory effect of SA on germination of Ara-bidopsis seeds was assigned to the activity of ABA (Rajjou et al.,2006). Hence, it is possible that the tendentiously reduced sen-sitivity of the why1 mutants toward SA might in fact be due toa reduced responsiveness toward ABA. Germination assays weretherefore also performed in the presence of different concentra-tions of ABA ranging from 2 to 20 µM. Ten micromolars of ABAwere sufficient to inhibit germination of almost 50% of the wild-type seeds. Twenty micromolars of ABA lowered the germinationrate of the wildtype seeds to 40% whereas the germination rate inthe mutant was on average twice as high (Figure 2B), illustratingthat why1 seeds are less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of ABA ongermination.THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF SA ON GERMINATION IS ABOLISHED BYABAMINE, AN INHIBITOR OF ABSCISIC ACID BIOSYNTHESISTo investigate whether the inhibitory effect of SA on germina-tion under the conditions employed here is indeed caused by aconcomitant increase in the level of ABA, germination of wild-type seeds on SA containing agar plates during the first 7 days ofdevelopment was assayed in the presence of abamine. Abamine isa specific inhibitor of the enzyme NCED preventing the forma-tion of the ABA precursor xanthoxin (Han et al., 2004) which isthe last intermediate of the ABA biosynthetic pathway being pro-duced in the plastid (Seo and Koshiba, 2011). When wildtype seedswere treated with 0.5 mM SA, less than 20% of seeds were able togerminate in the first 2 days after imbibition (Figure 3A). The ger-mination rate did not increase further after 4 days at which time ithad reached 80% (Figure 3A). When wildtype seeds were exposedto SA in the presence of abamine, germination was observed tobe as efficient as under control conditions without addition of SA(Figure 3A). When the same assays were done with seeds of thewhy1-1 mutant line, no differences in germination efficiency weredetectable between seeds treated either with only SA or with SA andabamine together, respectively, and the control setup (Figure 3B).why1-, gun1-, AND gun5 MUTANTS SHARE THE SAME INSENSITIVITYOF GERMINATION TOWARD SALICYLIC ACID AND ABSCISIC ACIDGermination assays revealed that why1 mutants are insensitivetoward SA and also to ABA.

The averagedpercentage of germinated seeds in the control experiments without SAand ABA, respectively, was set to 100% and used as a reference tocalculate the percentage of germination in the assays performed in thepresence of SA or ABA.Frontiers in Plant Science | Plant Physiology December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 4Isemer et al.

Dueto its dual localization in plastids and the nucleus, WHIRLY1 isan excellent candidate protein for transducing plastid signals tothe nucleus. Interestingly, seeds of some genomes uncoupled (gun)mutants, that are characterized by impaired plastid-to-nucleus sig-naling, were likewise shown to be insensitive toward ABA (Choyet al., 2008; Cottage et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2010; Kerchev et al.,2011). To investigate whether why1 mutants are comparable togun mutants with regard to ABA sensitivity of seeds, seeds of twogun1 mutants (gun1-1 and gun1-102), and one gun5 mutant weresubjected to the germination assay in the presence of differentconcentrations of ABA. At a concentration of 20 µM of ABA atwhich less than 20% of wildtype seeds were observed to germinate(Figure 4A), 60% of gun1-102 seeds, and about 80% of gun1-1 aswell as gun5 seeds showed germination (Figure 4A). This showsthat the insensitivity of gun1 and gun5 mutants toward ABA iscomparable to that of the why1 mutants.By application of the ABA inhibitor abamine it became obviousthat the inhibitory effect of SA on germination is actually due to aconcomitant increase in ABA content (Figure 3). Hence, mutantsthat are insensitive toward ABA during germination should alsobe insensitive toward SA. In order to investigate whether this isalso true for the gun mutants, seeds of gun1-1, gun1-102, andgun5 as well as wildtype seeds were placed on agar medium inthe presence of different concentrations of SA ranging from 0.2to 1 mM. While less than 70% of the wildtype seeds did germi-nate at a concentration of 0.5 mM SA, germination of the gunmutant seeds was only reduced by 20% by these concentrations(Figure 4B). The insensitivity of the gun mutants toward SAis in the same range as the insensitivity of the why1 mutants(Figure 2A).THE PLASTID ISOFORM OF WHIRLY1 ENHANCES THERESPONSIVENESS OF SEEDLINGS TOWARD ABSCISIC ACIDGermination assays indicated that WHIRLY1 is enhancing theresponsiveness of seeds toward ABA. To investigate whether eitherWHIRLY1 in plastids or WHIRLY1 in the nucleus or both isoformsare involved in the ABA response, the WHIRLY1 gene was overex-pressed under control of the 35S promoter in the why1-1 mutantbackground. Plants of a line accumulating an HA-tagged full-length protein (pnWHIRLY1:HA) were compared with a line accu-mulating a truncated protein lacking the PTP (nWHIRLY1:HA;Figure 5A). Both of the overexpression lines did not show anyphenotypical difference when compared to wildtype (Figures 5Band 6A).The subcellular localization of the two recombinant proteinsthat is shown schematically in Figure 5A was confirmed bywww.frontiersin.org December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 5Isemer et al.

When ABA was applied, seeds of plants accu-mulating WHIRLY1 in the nucleus only (nWHIRLY1:HA)were less sensitive to ABA than wildtype seeds (Figure 6B).They are hence comparable to the seeds of why1 mutants(Figure 2B). Seeds of plants accumulating WHIRLY1, how-ever, in both chloroplasts and nuclei (pnWHIRLY1:HA) dis-played a much higher responsiveness to ABA than wildtypeseeds (Figure 6B). At a concentration of 5 µM ABA less than10% of the seeds were observed to germinate whereas morethan 60% of wildtype seeds germinated (Figure 6B). With asecond independent pnWHIRLY1:HA line similar results wereobtained.ABA INHIBITS GERMINATION IN THE PRESENCE OF ABAMINEThe results of the germination assays performed with seedsof transgenic lines overexpressing the full-length WHIRLY1:HA(pnWHIRLY1:HA) or a truncated version lacking the plastid tran-sit peptide (nWHIRLY1:HA) indicated that the plastid locatedisoform of WHIRLY1 is enhancing the responsiveness of seedstoward ABA. This is surprising considering that ABA has beenexogenously applied and even endogenous ABA is formed fromxanthoxin outside of plastids (Cutler et al., 2010; Seo and Koshiba,2011). In order to investigate whether the effect of ABA is medi-ated by changes in the level of xanthoxin inside plastids, theeffect of ABA on germination of wildtype seeds was assayed inthe presence of abamine which is known to inhibit the enzymeNCED catalyzing the formation of xanthoxin (Han et al., 2004).Addition of abamine enhanced the rate of germination indicat-ing that the inhibitor indeed prevented the formation of ABA(Figure 7). When ABA was added alone the number of germi-nating seeds was reduced by 50% (Figure 7). When the sameconcentration of ABA was applied in the presence of abamine,the germination rate was the same as that determined in thepresence of ABA only (Figure 7). This result shows that theexogenously applied ABA inhibits germination independent ofthe intrinsic production of the ABA precursor xanthoxin inplastids.DISCUSSIONThe WHIRLY1 protein was first discovered as a nuclear transcrip-tion factor implicated in PR and its function as a nuclear activatorof PR genes was shown to depend on SA (Desveaux et al., 2000).Later, WHIRLY1 was found to be imported into plastids (Krauseet al., 2005) whereas its potential to be translocated from the plas-tid to the nucleus was not known until recently (Isemer et al.,2012). SA is the only plant hormone completely synthesized inplastids (Wildermuth et al., 2001). It is hence possible that activa-tion of WHIRLY1 in response to pathogens in fact occurs inside theorganelle and not in the nucleus. This idea would be in accordancewith the model presented by Brisson and co-workers on activa-tion of an inactive pool of WHIRLY1 by SA (Desveaux et al., 2004,2005). This would mean that plant responses toward pathogensmediated by SA would be under control of plastids as also recentlysuggested (Nomura et al., 2012).The results obtained in this study suggested that WHIRLY1 isalso involved in SA induced inhibition of germination. By simulta-neous addition of SA and abamine, an inhibitor of the biosynthesisof ABA, it was, furthermore, demonstrated that the effect of SAon germination can be explained by its stimulatory effect on thebiosynthesis of ABA. Although ABA is formed from xanthoxin inthe cytoplasm, the enzymes limiting the level of its precursor arelocated inside chloroplasts (Seo and Koshiba, 2011). The crosstalkbetween ABA and SA was observed to be important in determiningthe outcome of plant pathogen interactions (Cao et al., 2011). Thelevels of both hormones and also that of jasmonic acid, anotherstress related hormone originating from plastids, were shown todepend on each other (Abreu and Munné-Bosch, 2009). It is likelythat there is a crosstalk of the three stress related hormones com-pletely or partially synthesized inside plastids which are the siteswww.frontiersin.org December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 7Isemer et al.

Wildtype seeds were grown on agar medium containing eitherno additive or 10 µM abscisic acid (ABA), 50 µM abamine or 10 µMABA+50 µM abamine, respectively. Germination rates were determined inthe period from 1 to 7 days after imbibition. Values are the means±SEMobtained from five independent experiments (20–50 seeds each).where stress is primarily perceived in the plant cell (Bouvier et al.,2009).The germination assays clearly demonstrated that WHIRLY1 isenhancing the responsiveness of germinating seeds toward ABA.Hence, the why1 mutants also belong to the group of aba insensi-tive (abi) mutants. The previously identified abi mutants 1-5 wereselected for their ability to germinate in the presence of 10 µmolABA (Finkelstein, 1994), a concentration inhibiting germinationof wildtype seeds. ABA responsiveness of the why1 mutants is com-parable to the abi1 mutant (Finkelstein and Somerville, 1990) andeven lower than the ABA sensitivity of the abi4 and abi5 mutants(Finkelstein, 1994). WHIRLY1 is found both in plastids and inthe nucleus of the same cell (Grabowski et al., 2008). Germina-tion assays with transgenic lines accumulating WHIRLY1 either inboth plastids and the nucleus (pnWHIRLY) or only in the nucleus(nWHIRLY1) showed that it is the plastid localized WHIRLY1that enhances the responsiveness of seedlings toward ABA. Theinhibitory effect of ABA on germination was observed after exter-nal addition of ABA to the medium as well as after induction of itsbiosynthesis by addition of SA. It was shown before that WHIRLY1as well as the other members of the WHIRLY protein family canform 24-mers in plastids, thereby building up a hollow oligomerwhich might store metabolites in order to protect the cell frompossibly toxic compounds (Cappadocia et al., 2012). Such struc-tures could also act as scaffolds binding specific proteins involvedin signaling and thereby controlling the flow of signaling informa-tion (Zeke et al., 2009). Furthermore, the results obtained by useof the overexpression lines demonstrate an important function forthe plastid in adjusting the activity of ABA.Abscisic acid was recently reported to bind to plastid locatedmagnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase which was proposed tofunction as a receptor of ABA (Shang et al., 2010). So far, it is notknown whether ABA binds to the enzyme inside plastids or to adomain of the H subunit protruding into the cytoplasm (Shanget al., 2010). Both scenarios are possible because ABA can pene-trate membranes in its protonated form and is known to diffuseinside the cell where it accumulates at sites of low pH (Seo andKoshiba, 2011).ABA responsive cis-elements have been found in the promotersof many genes responding also to plastid signals. Multiple copiesof ABRE (ACGT, CGTGTC) known to confer ABA responsivenessare in close proximity to G-boxes which are responsible for light-induced induction of the target genes. The transcription factorABI4, which was first described in connection with ABA insensi-tivity (Finkelstein, 1994), was shown to be common to differentpathways of plastid signaling (Koussevitzky et al., 2007). The ABI4gene encodes the apetala 2 transcription factor involved in tran-scriptional repression of photosynthesis associated nuclear geneswhen chloroplast development is blocked by addition of norflura-zon (NF; Koussevitzky et al., 2007). NF blocks the production ofchlorophyll due to its inhibitory effect on carotenoid biosynthe-sis and is commonly used as a herbicide (Sandmann and Böger,1989). Alternatively, chloroplast development has been frequentlyblocked by treatment of seedlings with lincomycin, an inhibitor ofplastid translation (Koussevitzky et al., 2007).Mutants impaired in plastid signaling were named gun. Orig-inally, five gun mutants (gun1-5) were identified in a screen formutants that expressed photosynthesis associated nuclear geneswhen seedlings were grown in the presence of NF (Susek et al.,1993; Mochizuki et al., 2001). The abi4 mutant shows derepres-sion of LHCB gene expression levels after treatment of seedlingswith lincomycin and is therefore also a gun mutant. In contrast,in the abi1-3 and abi5 mutants the expression of this gene wasrepressed to a similar extent as in the wildtype (Koussevitzky et al.,2007). This indicates that ABI4 is involved in plastid signalingand suggests that ABA itself is a plastid signal. Germination assayswith gun mutants gun1-1, gun1-102, and gun5 performed underthe same conditions as with the why1 mutant showed that thesemutants have reduced sensitivity toward ABA during germination,furthermore indicating an important role for ABA during plastidretrograde signaling.Most plastid signals so far described accumulate inside theplastid, e.g., reactive oxygen species, intermediates of tetrapyrrolebiosynthesis or proteins such as GUN1 (Beck, 2005; Woodsonand Chory, 2008; Leister, 2012). The ABA precursor xanthoxin isformed from carotenoids inside plastids but the last steps of ABAFrontiers in Plant Science | Plant Physiology December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 283 | 8Isemer et al. Plastid WHIRLY1 mediates ABA signalingbiosynthesis take place in the cytoplasm (Seo and Koshiba, 2011).Germination assays in the presence of both ABA and abaminedemonstrated that ABA itself and not the plastid located precur-sor xanthoxin inhibits germination. Earlier on it was deduced thatABA is unlikely to be a plastid signal because the ABA deficientmutant aba1 failed to accumulate LHCB mRNA when grown inthe presence of lincomycin (Koussevitzky et al., 2007). However,this conclusion is only relevant for plastid signaling induced by lin-comycin and for only one of the many photosynthesis associatednuclear genes as target.In fact, many more factors have been shown to affect plas-tid functionality and to change the expression of nuclear genesencoding chloroplast proteins (Leister, 2005). Plastid signals donot only control chloroplast development, but are also requiredfor optimization of photosynthesis under changing environmen-tal conditions to which mature plants are exposed (Pogson et al.,2008). Moreover, plastid signals were shown to affect processesnot directly involving plastids such as the accumulation of antho-cyanins (Ruckle and Larkin, 2009), the circadian clock (Hassidimet al., 2007), and pathogen response (Nomura et al., 2012). In fact,the entire development of plants seems to be controlled by plastidsat least to some extent (Inaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010).Taken together, the results of the studies on why1 mutantsand transgenic lines accumulating WHIRLY1 either in plastidsand the nucleus or in the nucleus only suggest that the plastidlocated WHIRLY1 enhances the responsiveness of seeds towardABA. Whether WHIRLY1 directly interacts with ABA and whetherit is translocated from plastids to the nucleus in response to ABAremains to be investigated. In order to place WHIRLY1 withinthe network of plastid-to-nucleus signaling, nuclear gene expres-sion in the why1 mutants and in double mutants affected inaddition in one of the well-known gun genes needs to be sys-tematically analyzed in response to various treatments known toimpair chloroplast development.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSMichela Zottini (University of Padova, Italy) is thanked for sci-entific advice.
