and two phenolic acids, chlorogenic (8) and salicylic acids (9) and D-manitol (10), were isolated
from the ethanolic extract of the stems of Alibertia sessilis. Structures of 1 and of the known
compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All compounds isolated were evaluated
for their antifungal activities against two phytopathogenic fungi strains Cladosporium
cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum by direct bioautography.
Keywords: Rubiaceae, Alibertia sessilis, phenolics, iridoids, antifungal
Introduction
In our continuing search for antifungal agents from plants
from the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest in the State of São
Paulo, Brazil, we screened several species of the Rubiaceae
family, which is recognized as a rich source of bioactive
metabolites.1-5 We particularly studied plants of the Alibertia
genus, since relatively few chemical studies have been
reported. Our previous investigation with the leaves of A.
macrophylla resulted in the isolation of antifungal iridoid
aglycones, and caffeic acid ester derivatives.6,7 Additionally,
flavones and coumarin have been reported for A. myrciifolia.8
This paper reports the bioassay-guided isolation and
structure elucidation of the new 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-
O-β-D-(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco-
pyranoside (1) (Figure 1), and the known lignans (+)-
lyoniresinol-3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (6), (-)-lyoniresinol-
3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7), which are being described
for the first time for Rubiaceae. This paper also reports the
isolation of iridoids geniposidic acid (2), geniposide (3), 6α-
hydroxygeniposide (4) and 6β-hydroxygeniposide (5),
phenolic acids, chlorogenic (8) and salicylic acid (9) and
D-manitol (10). The antifungal activity of compound 1 against
Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides was
detected by using direct bioautography.
Results and Discussion
The antifungal ethanol extract from Alibertia sessilis
stems was partitioned with hexane, ethyl acetate and n-

butanol. These sub-extracts were tested against
Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides
using direct bioautography showing that only the ethyl
acetate fraction was active. This sub-extract was bioassay-
guide fractioned to afford a new phenolic derivative 1
along with several known compounds.
Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amorphous
powder. The molecular formula was determined as
being C29H38O17 from the HRESIMS at m/z 657.2065
[M-H]–. The UV spectrum showed an absorption
maximum at 279 nm, which is compatible with a
phenolic structure.  The IR spectrum showed a
characteristic absorption band attributable to the
following groups: carbonyl (1708 cm-1), hydroxyl
(3418 cm-1), and aromatic (1605 and 1509 cm-1), as
well as a glycosidic linkage (1063 cm-1). The 1H and
13C NMR spectra (Table 1) revealed signals for two
1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted symmetrical aromatic rings.
The 1H NMR exhibited singlet signals corresponding
to five aromatic methoxyls at δH 3.77 (6H, OCH3-3,5),
3.68 (3H, OCH3-4), and 3.87 (6H, OCH3-3′′′,5′′′) and
two sets of aromatic proton signals at δH 6.41 (2H, H-
2,6) and 7.34 (2H, H-2′′′,6′′′) due to a 3,4,5-trimethoxy
phenyl derivative and symmetrical 3,5-dimethoxy-4-
hydroxy-benzoyl moieties, respectively.9 This was
supported by the gHMBC spectrum, which showed
cross-peaks corresponding to a long-range coupling
of hydrogen at δH 6.41 and carbon signals at δC 155.9
(C-1), 154.7 (C-3,5), 134.7 (C-4) and 96.5 (C-2,6) and
also between hydrogen at δH 7.34 and carbon signals
at δC 167.9 (C=O), 149.1 (C-3′′′,5′′′), 143.1 (C-4′′′),
120.6 (C-1′′′) and 108.5 (C-2′′′,6′′′). Others signals
observed in 1H and 13C NMR spectra are consistent
with glycosyl moieties. According to literature,10 the
comparison of the 13C NMR data of the glycosidic
moiety of various other analogous compounds, the
structure of 1 seems to be composed of a glucosyl [δC
103.2 (C-1′), 74.9 (C-2′), 77.9 (C-3′), 71.5 (C-4′), 76.9
(C-5′) and 68.2 (C-6′)] and an apiosyl [δC 110.4 (C-
1′′), 78.7 (C-2′′), 79.0 (C-3′′), 75.0 (C-4′′) and 67.9
(C-6′′)] moieties. The 1H, 13C NMR and TOCSY spectra
confirmed the presence of these two sugar moieties
due to the presence of two anomeric signals at δH 4.79
(d, J 7.5 Hz)/δC 103.2 (CH) for glucose and δH 5.01
(d, J 2.3 Hz)/δC 110.4 (CH) for apiose. Furthermore,
the coupling constants J 7.5 Hz of the anomeric proton
signal of the D-glucosyl moiety as well as the chemical
shift (δC 110.4) of the anomeric carbon of the D-apiosyl
moiety, demonstrated that both sugar moieties have
β-anomeric configurations. The gHMBC spectrum of
1 revealed cross-peaks corresponding to long-range
couplings of hydrogens H-6′ of β-glucose at δH 3.63
(d, J 10.0 Hz) and 4.06 (d, J 10.0 Hz) and carbon C-
1′′ of apiose at δC 110.4; in this way, the β-D-apiosyl
moiety was attached to C-6′ of the glucose. The
chemical shift of the oxymethylene carbon C-6′ (δC
68.2) was used to confirm the disaccharide linkage as
apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-glucopyranoside.10 In addition,
long-range correlations between H-5′′ signals of β-D-
apiose [δH 4.31 (d, J 11.4 Hz) and 4.39 (d, J 11.4 Hz)]
and the syringoyl carbonyl group (δC 167.9) indicated
that the 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoyl group was
attached to C-5′′ of the β-D-apiose. Finally, the proton
at δH 4.79 (H-1′ of glucose) was correlated with C-1
of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl group (δC 155.9),
indicating that the β-D-glucosyl moiety was located at
C-1. Therefore, the structure of compound 1 was
established as being 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-β-D-
(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco-
pyranoside.
The known compounds 2-10 were identified by
comparing their 1H and 13C NMR data with those
previously published in literature.11-16
The antifungal activity of compounds 1, 2, 6-10 against
Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was
evaluated by direct bioautography on a TLC plate.17,18 Only
compound 1 exhibited moderate activity (MIC of 100 μg),
when compared with the standard nystatin (1.0 μg).
Experimental
General experimental procedures
1D- (1H, 13C, TOCSY) and 2D- (gHMQC and gHMBC)
NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500
spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz
(13C), using adequate solvent with TMS as internal
standard. Accurate-mass measurements were performed
on a quadrupole-time of flight instrument (UltrOTOF-Q,
Bruker Daltonics). IR spectrum was obtained on a Nicolet-
730 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs. UV absorption
was measured on a Varian ProStar 330 diode array
spectrophotometer. Optical rotation was measured on a
Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena. Preparative HPLC was carried

out in a Varian HPLC, using a Phenomenex Luna RP18
(2) column (250 × 21.20 mm i.d. × 10 µm).
Plant material
Alibertia sessilis was collected in the Estação
Ecológica e Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu (Ecological and
Experimental Reserve of Mogi-Guaçu), São Paulo, Brazil
in November 2003 by Dr M.C.M. Young and identified
by Dr I. Cordeiro. The voucher specimen (SP 370.914)
was deposited at the Botanical Institute Herbarium, São
Paulo, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation of constituents
The dried and powdered stems (50.0 g) of A. sessilis
were extracted exhaustively with ethanol, at room
temperature, to give a crude material (4.15 g), which
was partitioned in hexane, EtOAc and n-BuOH. After
evaporation, the EtOAc extract (1.30 g) was submitted
to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using
MeOH as eluent to give 15 fractions after TLC analysis.
Fraction 1 (116.2 mg) was composed of a precipitate,
which was recrystalized with H2O to give D-manitol (10)
(63.7 mg). Fraction 2 (146.4 mg) was subjected to
column chromatography on RP-18 using a gradient
mixture of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/EtOAc as eluent to
give 11 subfractions. Subfraction 2.1 (80.0 mg) was re-
chromatographed on RP-18, eluted with H2O with
increasing amounts of MeOH to afford geniposidic acid
(2) (11.8 mg). Subfraction 2.7 (29.6 mg) was also
submitted to column chromatography on RP-18, using a
gradient solvent system of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/
EtOAc as eluent to yield 7 subfractions after TLC
analysis. Subfraction 2.7.6 (18.8 mg) was chromato-
graphed by preparative HPLC (C18 column; mobile phase:
MeOH/H2O (3:7 v/v); flow rate: 10 mL min
-1; UV
detector: 238 nm) to separate the mixture of the
diastereoisomeric lignans (+)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-D-
glucopyranoside (6) (6.5 mg) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3α-
O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7) (5.8 mg).19 Subfraction 2.7.7
(6.7 mg) was identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-
β-D-(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco-
pyranoside (1). Fraction 4 (274.2 mg) was fractioned on
RP-18 using H2O with increasing amounts of MeOH as
mobile phase to give salicylic acid (9) (6.4 mg). Fractions
5 and 6 (104.9 mg) were combined and submitted to
column chromatography on silica gel eluting with
hexane/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH to give 6.9 mg of
chlorogenic acid (8).
The n-butanol extract (0.55 g) was submitted to column
chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as
eluent to give 7 fractions after TLC analysis. Fraction 3
(180.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on
RP-18 using a gradient mixture of H2O/MeOH to give 9
subfractions. Subfraction 3.4 (10.2 mg) was identified as

Antifungal Assay
The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays
Cladosporium sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C.
cladosporioides (Fresen) SPC 140 had been kept at the
Botanical Institute of São Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal
assay, solutions containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 μg of
the test compound were prepared. 10.0 μL of each solution
was applied to pre-coated TLC plates eluted with EtOAc/
MeOH (7:3 v/v) and dried to completely remove all solvents.
The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension
of Cladosporium sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides
in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in
darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C. A clear inhibition
zone appeared against a dark background indicating the
minimal amount of the compound required to eliminate
the fungus (detection limits - minimum amount required
for the inhibition of fungal growth on TLC plates). Nystatin
was used as the positive control (1 μg).17,18
Conclusions
Lignans 6 and 7 are here described for the first time as
being found in Rubiaceae and the antifungal phenolic
glucoside 1 is being reported for the first time in literature.
Compound 10 was previously isolated from Alibertia
myrciifolia. Phenolics 8 and 9 are here reported for the
first time as being found in genus Alibertia. Iridoids 2
and 3-5 are in agreement with chemosystematic
correlations and botanical occurrence in the Rubiaceae
family. This study will contribute significantly to improve
knowledge about secondary metabolites and biological
activity for one more species from the Brazilian Cerrado.
