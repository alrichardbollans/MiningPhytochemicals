Abstract
Rehmannia is a medicinal plant in China. Autotoxicity has been reported to be one of the major problems hindering the
consecutive monoculture of Rehmannia. However, potential autotoxins produced by the fibrous roots are less known. In
this study, the autotoxicity of these fibrous roots was investigated. Four groups of autotoxic compounds from the aqueous
extracts of the fibrous roots were isolated and characterized. The ethyl acetate extracts of these water-soluble compounds
were further analyzed and separated into five fractions. Among them, the most autotoxic fraction (Fr 3) was subjected to
GC/MS analysis, resulting in 32 identified compounds. Based on literature, nine compounds were selected for testing their
autotoxic effects on radicle growth. Seven out of the nine compounds were phenolic, which significantly reduced radicle
growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The other two were aliphatic compounds that showed a moderate inhibition
effect at three concentrations. Concentration of these compounds in soil samples was determined by HPLC. Furthermore,
the autotoxic compounds were also found in the top soil of the commercially cultivated Rehmannia fields. It appears that a
close link exists between the autotoxic effects on the seedlings and the compounds extracted from fibrous roots of
Rehmannia.

Introduction
Rehmannia (Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch) is in the Scrophular-
iaceae family and is one of the most common and important
medicinal herbal plants in China. It is perennial and its fresh or
dried tuberous roots are used as a high demand traditional
Chinese medicinal ingredient for hematologic conditions, sedation,
insomnia and diabetes [1,2]. Its commercial cultivation has been
practiced for almost 1500 years in China. However, the
consecutively monocultured plants are prone to severe diseases
resulting in reduced biomass, especially the tuberous products. To
maintain the cultivation, the farmers commonly limited the
cultivation on a same plot once every eight years. Therefore, less
desirable areas outside Jiaozuo had to be used for the planting with
decreased tuber yields and lower product quality [3].
The autotoxicity issue has attracted much attention [4,5].
Autotoxicity is the phenomenon whereby mature plants inhibit the
growth of their own seedlings through the release of autotoxic
chemicals. It has been found to exist in various crops [6,7], such as
greenhouse crops [8,9], fruits [10,11], forage [12,13], horticultural
and medicinal plants [4,5,14,15,16]. Several groups of chemicals
have been implicated in autotoxicity, including terpenoids,
phenolics, steroids, alkaloids, and cyanogenic glycosides. Recently,
autotoxicity in Rehmannia has been reported [15,16,17] especially
in relation to the compounds derived from the root exudates.
However, to date, the degradation of fibrous roots and its products
had not been studied, and the mechanism of autotoxicity in
Rehmannia remains unknown.
This study aims to identify substances that contribute directly to
Rehmannia autotoxicity. A number of potentially autotoxic
compounds from the fibrous roots were isolated and characterized.
The inhibitory effect of these compounds on seedling growth was
observed. Furthermore, the concentration of these bioactive
compounds in the top soil collected from one-year cultivated
and two-year consecutively moncultured Rehmannia fields was
determined.
Materials and Methods
Sample collection and autotoxic compound extraction
Water extraction. The fields were located in Jiao-zuo
County (113u219E, 35u249N), He-nan province of China, which
is the optimal production areas of Rehmannia. The samples were
collected in October 2008 (Figure S1).
Fibrous roots of one-year cultivated Rehmannia plants at the
mature stage were collected. The air-dried roots (500 g), passed
2 mm sieve, were soaked in 1000 mL distilled water at 25–30uC
for 48 h. The extract was filtered, and the extraction was repeated
three times. The aqueous extracts from the three extractions were
combined and concentrated to 20 mL under vacuum at 50uC,
then freeze-dried under liquid N2 at 2180uC Approximately
530 mg of the dried material were obtained from the 500 g of air-
dried fibrous roots.
Top soil samples (20 cm depth) were collected from both one-
year cultivated and two-year consecutively moncultured Rehman-
nia fields in Jiaozuo county at harvest time. A soil sample from an
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e28806adjacent uncultivated field was collected as a control. Potential
autotoxic compounds were extracted from the soil samples using
the same method for the fibrous roots. Approximately 400 mg of
dried material were obtained from the 500 g air-dried soil samples.
Ethanol extraction and partitioning. Air-dried fibrous
roots (2 kg) were extracted with 95% ethanol (5 L) at room
temperature for 5 d. This process was repeated once. The extract
was concentrated by evaporation to 200 mL at 50uC under
vacuum followed by freeze-drying under liquid N2 (2180uC), and
then dissolved in 200 mL distilled water.
The aqueous solution was consecutively partitioned with
petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol, as
shown in Figure 1. The solvent extractions were performed by
shaking in separation funnels for 10 min, followed by evaporation
under vacuum.
Bioassays and statistical analysis
To examine the functional effect of the potential autotoxic
compounds on Rehmannia growth, measurements of Rehmannia
radicles in petri dishes was performed. The extracts of petroleum
ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and the ethyl acetate-
extracted fractions (1–5), of fibrous roots, monocultured soils for 1
year and 2 years, and uncultivated soil, were diluted with distilled
water into 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg L
21. 5 mL of each of the diluted
solutions were transferred into the 10-cm diameter petri dishes
containing double-layered filter paper (Whatman No. 42). In
addition, individualcompounds, including7aliphatic and 2phenolics
as identified in Fr3, were dissolved in a small volume of methanol and
transferred onto the double-layered filter paper in the petri dishes.
The solvents were evaporated in a draft chamber for 1 h. The filter
paper containing these compounds was moistenedwith5 mL distilled
water. The final concentrations of the compounds in water were 2,
10, and 50 mg L
21, while distilled water was used as control. Twenty
Rehmannia seeds were placed on the filter paper in the petri dishes.
All dishes were maintained in a tissue culture room at 26uCw i t h
fluorescent lights for 11 h (8:00–20:00) as described previously [7].
The fluorescent light intensity was 4.1760.186103 lux. Germinated
seeds with .1 mm radius were recorded and the radicle lengths were
measured after incubation for 5 d.
The radicle lengths of the treated ones in comparison with the
controls were used as an index of the inhibition rates (IRs). IR was
calculated as: IR = (control - treatment)/control6100%. When
IR is greater than 0, it indicates an inhibition; conversely when IR
is less than 0, it indicates promoting growth [18]. All data were
subject to an analysis of variance using the Statistical Analysis
System Program (SPSS). Each value was expressed as the mean of
three replicates6standard error (SE).
Identification of autotoxic chemicals
The ethyl acetate extract was further analyzed. About 8 g of the
extract was subjected to column chromatography (CC), packed
with silica gel (200–300 mesh) and eluted with chloroform
(CHCl3)-methanol (MeOH), followed by a gradient solvent system
(0–100 MeOH) to yield five fractions (Fr1-5). The fractions were

value. Preliminary bioassay study indicated that fraction 3 (Fr3)
exhibited the greatest inhibitory activity on radicle growth of
Rehmannia. Thus, Fr3 was further purified using the reversed
phase multi-purpose GC column chromatography (Varian,
California, U.S.A., VF-5 ms, 30 m60.25 mm60.25 mm).
The GC/MS fingerprints of Fr3 were obtained with a GC/MS
(Autospec-240 MS Ion Trap mass spectroscopy, Varian, Califor-
nia, U.S.A.). Fraction 3 was subsequently dissolved into 2 mL
redistilled MeOH. One mL aliquot of this solution was evaporated
under a stream of helium to remove residual water. A mixture of
10 mL redistilled MeOH and 10 mL N, O-Bis (trimethylsilyl)
trifluoro acetamide (BSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS)
was added to the residue to produce trimethylsilyl derivatives by
heating at 100uC for 1 h. The solution was filtered through a
0.45 mm filter before injected into the GC-MS system.
The injection volume was 1 mL. Helium was used as the carrier
gas, and the flow rate was adjusted to 10 mL min
21.T h eo v e n
temperature was initially programmed at 50uCa n dr a m p e dt o2 7 0 uC
at a rate of 5uC?min
21, where it remained for 10 min. MS data were
acquired in the negative ionization mode. The full scan mass covered
a range from m/z 50 to 1500. The m/z values for standard
autotoxins and the compounds as available in the literature wereused
to match with those obtained in the spectra for the study.
HPLC analysis
To determine whether the autotoxic compounds identified in
Rehmannia root extracts also existed in ground soil, we tested the
soil samples.
The concentration of autotoxic compounds in soil samples was
determined using a Waters HPLC system (Alliance HPLC system
Massachusetts, U.S.A.).The chromatographic system consisting of
a Waters 2695 HPLC system with a reversed-phase column
Zorbax Eclipse XDB –C18 (250 mm64.6 mm, 5 mm column) was
used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
21. The solvent system was a
linear gradient of solvent A (methanol) and solvent B (0.5 mol L
21
acetic acid in water): from 1% to 25% A in 0–10.0 min, and hold
at 25% A for 5 min;from 25% to 80% A in 15.0–25.0 min, and
hold at 80% A for 5 min;from 80% to 25% A in 30.0–40.0 min,
and hold at 25% A for 10 min. The injected volume was 10 mL of
a water solution of the extracts (10 mg mL
21). The column
temperature was maintained at 35uC. The UV detector was
performed at 280 nm. The chromatographic data were recorded
and processed with a Waters empower workstation.
HPLC grade acetonitrile, acetic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-
many), and filtered bi-distilled water, were used for HPLC analysis.
The methanol used for extraction was from ‘‘Honeywell Internation-
al’’ (New Jersey, U.S.A.). Standards of phenolic acids, including (gallic
acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, ferulic
acid, benzoic acid, and salicylic acid,) were purchased from Sigma
Chemicals Co., U.S.A.. Solvents and standards of phenolic acids were
chromatographic grade. The specific recovery rates (%) for the
standards were: gallic acid, 96.2464.42;4-Hydroxybenzoic acid,
92.2665.35; vanillic acid, 92.1563.22; protocatechuic acid,
92.4465.06; ferulic acid, 93.2565.31; benzoic acid, 90.0164.38;
and salicylic acid, 90.0663.21.
The dry materials from the water extract were dissolved into
100 mL methanol and passed through a 0.22 mmg l a s sf i b e rs i e v e .7
Phenolic acids compounds found in the samples extracts were dentified
by matching the retention time and their spectral characteristics against
those of standards. The separation procedures were repeated six times
for each standard compound, and data were presented as mean6SE.

Identification of Autotoxic Compounds of Rehmannia
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e28806two-year monocultured soils), the autotoxic compounds extracted
from the fibrous roots showed greater inhibitive effects on the
radicle growth of Rehmannia (Table 1). The inhibition rate
increased with higher concentrations of the extracts. The IR
peaked at 50 mg?L
21 with 75.76% reduction in seedling radicles
(P,0.01; Table 1). A similar trend was found in the soil extracts,
but their inhibitory effects were always lower than those of the
fibrous roots’. The result indicated that the chemical compounds
extracted from the fibrous roots had a major auto-inhibitory effect
on the growth of Rehmannia radicle.
Bioassay of partitioned compounds of fibrous root
extracts
The bioassay with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate,
and n-butanol partitions showed that the four extracts exhibited
dose-dependent inhibition effects on the radicle growth and that
the ethyl acetate extract had the greatest inhibitory effect (Table 2).
At the concentration of 50 mg L
21, the inhibition rates of
petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol extracts
were 8.7%, 5.8%, 64.2%, and 25.8%, respectively.
Bioassay of column chromatography fractions of ethyl
acetate extract
Bioassays with each of the five fractions from ethyl acetate
extract showed a significant reduction in the length of the radicle
in the presence of Fr3 (P,0.01; Table 3). When the concentration
was greater than 20 mg L
21, the reduction reached 100%. This
indicates that the chemical compounds in Fr3 had a major auto-
inhibitory effect on the seedling growth, and so Fr3 was considered
a candidate for further identification and characterization.
Autotoxic effect of compounds identified in fraction 3
By comparing with a GC/MS user-library spectrum of pure
reference compounds, GC/MS analysis for Fr3 identified a total of

Identification of Autotoxic Compounds of Rehmannia
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e2880632 compounds in Fr3. They were classified into 5 groups:
phenolics, aliphatic compounds, terpenoids, steroids, and others
(Figure 2, Table 4).
Previous studies suggested that several chemicals detected in the
bioactive Fr3 were possibly allelopathic compounds, which were
reported as allelochemicals in other crops [4,8,19]. Based on
previous reports and the availability of the chemicals in Fr3, nine
individual compounds were selected to test their potential autotoxic
effects on Rehmannia radicle growth (Table 5). Among the 9
chemicals examined, seven phenolic compounds showed dose-
respondent inhibitory effects on the seedling growth. Specifically,
the radicle of the seedlings reduced significantly by 45–76% when
they were treated with the phenolic compounds (except salicylic
acid) at a concentration of 50 mg?L
21 (P,0.01). Ferulic acid and
vanillin acid were the most potent compounds in the test, and
therefore, they were considered as the potential allelochemicals. All
of the compounds inhibited the seedling growth even at a low
concentration (e.g.,2m g ?L
21,P ,0.01), and IRs increased with
increasing concentrations. Similarly, the compounds in the aliphatic
acid family (e.g., tetradecanoic acid and oleic acid) exhibited dose-
respondent inhibitory effects on the seedling growth. The extent of
inhibition was around 25% for each compound (Table 5). The
results demonstrate clearly that the compounds extracted from the
roots of Rehmannia are potent inhibitors on seedling growth. In
addition, both the phenolic acid and aliphatic acid compounds
might contribute to the autotoxicity of Rehmannia.

Identification of Autotoxic Compounds of Rehmannia
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e28806Identification of autotoxic compounds in soil samples
In the fields where Rehmannia were monocultivated for 1 year
and 2 years, seven phenolic compounds identified as the
potential autotoxins were found at different concentrations
(Table 6, Figure 3), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid being the most
abundant. In the control and 1-year monocultured soil samples,
only 6 phenolic compounds were detected. Thus, the findings
presented here indicate that the compounds identified in
Rehmannia roots can be found in relative abundance in soils
previously cultivated with Rehmannia, whereas they are absent
or present at much lower concentrations in non-cultivated soils.
Furthermore, the higher inhibitory chemical concentration in
the consecutively monocultured soil than in the newly planted
soil was due to the accumulation of autotoxic compounds in the
rhizosphere soil.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the compounds isolated from
ethyl acetate-soluble extracts of Rehmannia fibrous roots had
the most auto-inhibitory effects on the seedling growth.
Specifically, 32 chemicals were identified by GC/MS that
included 9 aliphatic, 10 phenolic, 4 terpene, 4 steroids and 5
other compounds. Among them, the 7 phenolic compounds and
2 aliphatic acids selected for testing the inhibition effects
showed a significant suppressive function on the seedling
growth. The inhibitory effects were somewhat related to the
concentration of the autotoxins. More importantly, all 7
bioactive phenolic compounds were detected in the top soil of
the Rehmannia fields. It appeared that our study provided the
first direct evidence that the autotoxic chemicals detected in the
soils of different-year consecutively monocultured Rehmannia
fields could be traced back to the roots of Rehmannia. During
soil sample collection, we noticedt h a tal a r g ea m o u n to ff i b r o u s
root waste was left in the soil after harvest. It is likely that the
autotoxic compounds found in soils were derived partly from
the root exudates or the degraded plant tissues. Once released
into the soil and allowed to accumulate, these compounds
might play a major role in the autotoxic effects on the seedling
growth.
In this study, we found that the inhibitory effect of each single
compound was not as potent as the bioactive Fr3 (which contained
all compounds). It might result from the additive or synergistic
effect of the mixture compounds extracted from Rehmannia
fibrous roots and its rhizosphere soil. The similar results were
reported in the case of other plants [20,21].
The consecutive monoculture problems in the case study were
also defined as ‘‘replanting disease’’ or ‘‘sick soil syndrome’’, and it
is a very common phenomenon in many fruit trees, such as apples,
pears, and plums. A wide variety of tree pathogens, including
bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and viruses, have been linked to the
‘‘replanting disease’’ in fruit trees. These pathogens may not be

Identification of Autotoxic Compounds of Rehmannia
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e28806harmful to the mature trees, yet they retard the growth of young
trees in the same field [22]. It has been reported that the presence
of fungal pathogens in soils contributes to the ‘‘replanting disease’’
of Rehmannia [23,24]. However, this study provides evidence that
the autotoxicity is another major cause of the disease [4].
Identification of the autotoxic compounds in this study might be
helpful to further understand the problems associated with
consecutive monoculture of Rehmannia, and it was also conducive
to make the solution to effectively control the ‘‘replanting disease’’
for Rehmannia in consecutively cropping sequence.
