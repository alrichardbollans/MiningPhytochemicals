Key Word Index--Lupinus arbustus subsp. cnlcarutus; Leguminosae; bipiperidyl-indole alkaloid; gramoden- 
drine (l-acetyl-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro-5-[l-(l~-indol-3-yl-methyl)-2-piperidinyl]-pyridine). 
Abstract-A new bipiperidyl-indole alkaloid, gramodendrine, was isolated from Lupinus arbustus subsp. 
cafcarutus. Its structure was determined from spectral data, degradation to methoxymethylindole and 
synthesis from ammodendrine. 
The new alkaloid 1 was isolated from the previously 
uninvestigated Lupinus arbustus subsp. calcaratus 
during the course of an investigation dealing with the 
CNS depressant activity of the alkaloid fraction from 
this plant. GC-MS analysis of 1 indicated a M’ at m/z 
208. Of the numerous quinolizidine and piperidine 
alkaloids isolated from the genus Lupinus, only am- 
modendrine [l-acetyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-S-(2-piper- 
idinyl)pyridine] has this MW [l-5]. Analysis of 
this compound indicated that 1 was identical to am- 
modendrine in GC-MS R, and fragmentation pattern 
but other chromatographic (TLC) and spectral (NMR, 
IR) properties were distinctly different for the two 
compounds. These data suggested thermal decomposit- 
ion of the new alkaloid to ammodendrine during the 
course of GC. This was confirmed by prep. GC of 1 
followed by TLC of the isolated degradation product, 
which was found to be identical to ammodendrine. 
The principal difference between the ‘H NMR 
spectra of 1 and ammodendrine was the presence of 
signals due to 8 additional protons in the former. Five 
were found in the aromatic region (67.b7.7) and 
these, together with the broad peak due to an 
exchangeable proton at 68.3, indicated the presence 
of an indole ring. This was confirmed by the IR 
spectrum which was remarkably similar to that of 
ammodendrine except for the presence of a sharp 
band at 3480 cm-‘, which corresponded to an indole 
NH absorption. Other notable signals in the ‘H NMR 
spectrum of 1 were those at 82.1 (3H) and 6.6 (1H) 
I 
due to the amide methyl and vinyl protons, respec- 
tively, of the ammodendrine moiety. However, unlike 
the proton spectrum of ammodendrine, the isolated 
alkaloid lacked a peak due to an exchangeable piperi- 
dine NH proton in the 6 l-3 region. This suggested that 
the indole containing substituent of 1 was attached to 
the piperidine nitrogen. 
The decoupled ‘% NMR spectra of both 1 and 
ammodendrine exhibited double peaks for numerous 
carbons due to the presence of both amide con- 
formations. The resulting complexity precluded a 
complete analysis of these spectra without additional 
data. However, the spectrum of 1 was consistent with 
an indole derivative due to the presence of signals in 
the Slll-136 region. The rest of the spectrum was 
similar to that of ammodendrine. 
Mass spectral analysis of 1, using both EI and CI 
with probe temperatures below 150”, established a 
MW of 337. This indicated that the indole containing 
substituent attached to the ammodendrine moiety 
consisted of an indol-3-ylmethyl group. The other 
major peaks in the EI spectrum (m/z 207 and 130) 
supported this conclusion since both could arise from 
cleavage of methylene indole from 1. 
The above data suggested that 1 was N-(indol- 
3-yl-methyl)-ammodendrine. The proposed structure is 
an analog of gramine [3-(dimethylaminomethyl) in- 
dole], an alkaloid known for its tendency to react 
with nucleophiles after quaternization of the 
dimethylamino group [6]. Similar reactivity has been 
reported for other aminomethylindole containing al- 
kaloids [7,8]. The isolated alkaloid exhibited the same 
sensitivity to nucleophiles and yielded 3-methoxy- 
methylindole (TLC, EI-MS, ‘H NMR) when treated 
with Me1 in methanolic KOH. Under these con- 
ditions gramine also yields the same product [9]. This 
reactivity may explain the difficulty encountered in 
forming a stable salt of 1. Efforts to form the HCI, 
HC104, oxalate and picrate derivatives were all un- 
successful due to the apparent decomposition of the 
alkaloid.

The final proof of the proposed structure was 
obtained by the synthesis of 1 from ammodendrine by 
way of the Mannich reaction [lo]. A yield of over 
90% was obtained and the product was identical to 
the isolated alkaloid (TLC, ‘H and 13C NMR, MS, IR, 
UV). 
The close structural and biosynthetic [ll] relation- 
ship of 1 to both gramine and ammodendrine led to 
the name gramodendrine for this novel bipiperidyl- 
indole alkaloid. Experiments designed to characterize 
the pharmacology of gramodendrine are currently in 
progress. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Plant material. Lupinus abustus Doug]. ex Lindl. 
subsp. calcaratus (Kell.) Dunn was collected 10 miles east 
of the Hailey city limits in the Cold Creek region of Blaine 
County, Idaho, on July 9, 1979. The plant was identified by 
Dr. David B. Dunn and a voucher specimen (UMO 130847) 
is on deposit at the University of Missouri Herbarium, 
Columbia, MO 65201. 
Extraction and isolation of gramodendrine (1). The dried, 
powdered (40 mesh) above ground plant parts (200g) were 
homogenized with EtOH and processed as previously des- 
cribed [12] to give a crude alkaloid fraction. TLC analysis of 
the extract (Si gel, CHCIJ-MeOH- M NH.,OH, 1OO:lO:l) 
revealed the presence of several alkaloids (iodoplatinate 
reagent). One of these (R, 0.73) was isolated by prep. TLC 
(1 mm Si gel PF254) with the above solvent system. The 
band containing the desired alkaloid was detected under UV 
light (254nm) and was eluted with MeOH. This eluate was 
taken to dryness and the residue extracted with CH2C12. The 
latter extract was then subjected to HPLC. The system 
consisted of a Waters Associates 6OOOA solvent pump, U6K 
sample injector, 440UV detector (280nm), and two 
3.9 mm X 30 cm pPorasilR (IO CL m silica) columns in series. 
The solvent, CH2CI,-MeOH- M NHIOH (275:10:1), was 
utilized at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and the desired alkaloid 
was eluted in 5 min. Following HPLC, 1 was chromato- 
graphically homogeneous in the above TLC and HPLC 
systems. The isolated alkaloid also gave a single peak (R, = 
17 min) using the following X-MS system. The column 
(2 m x 2 mm glass) contained 3% OV-17 and was eluted with 
N2 (30ml/min) and temp. programmed from 140” to 265” at 
@/min. Sample components eluted from the column were 
detected by EI-MS (70eV). Under these conditions the 
isolated alkaloid gave a mass spectrum identical to am- 
modendrine [13]. 
The alkaloid was obtained as an amorphous solid and 
attempts to prepare a crystalline salt were unsuccessful. The 
yield of gramodendrine from the above isolation scheme 
was 28 mg. However, quantitative analysis (TLC) indicated 
that the dried plant material contained 0.02% of this al- 
kaloid.

by decoupling, comparison with the spectrum of am- 
modendrine [14] and related compounds [7,8], and prepn of 
the indol-3-yl-CD2-N derivative of 1. The deutzrated 
derivative was prepared as described below using deuterated 
paraformaldehyde and lacked the doublets at 63.10 and 3.95 
observed in the spectrum of 1. ‘%Z NMR (22.63 MHz, CDC13,

168.0 (s, C=O) [IS]. The doubling of some signals is due to 
the presence of two amide conformations. 
Degradation of 1 to 3-methoxymethylindole. 1 (15.8 mg) 
was dissolved in 1 ml of MeOH and treated with methyl 
iodide (50 ~1) and 25% methanolic KOH (50 ~1) as reported 
previously for the degradation of gramine [9]. The reaction 
mixture was then evapd to dryness and the residue extracted 
with ether. The residue from this extraction was subjected 
to column (1.5 cm x 20 cm) chromatography using Si gel and 
CH+&-MeOH (20: 1). The methoxymethylindole fraction 
was further purified by HPLC, as previously described, 
using a 3.9 mm x 30cm PPorasil” column with ethyl 
acetate-n-hexane (5 : I) at 5 ml/min. The yield of chromato- 
graphically pure methoxymethylindole was 2.3 mg. ‘H NMR 
(360MHz, acetone-d,): 3.3 (3H. s, CH3), 4.6 (2H, s, CH2), 
7.05 t, J = 8.5 Hz and 7.10 t, J = 8.5 Hz (2H, H-5 and H-6), 
7.30 (lH, s, H-2), 7.39 (IH, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-7), and 7.62 (IH, 
d, .J = 8.5 Hz, H-4). GC-MS 70 eV, m/z (rel. int.): 130 [M - 
OCHs]+ (loo), 103 [M - OCHj - HCN]’ (12), 77 [M - OCH,- 
HCN-HC=CH]+ (20) [16]. These spectral properties were 
identical to those of methoxymethylindole prepared from 
gramine. 
Synthesis of gramodendreine. Ammodendrine perchlorate 
(30 mg) and indole (11.3 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 ml EtOH 
with the aid of heat. Formalin (30 ~1) was added after 
cooling to room temp. and the reaction mixture was heated 
at 50” for 16 hr. The solvent was then removed and the residue 
subjected to column (1.5 cm x 25 cm) chromatography using 
Si gel and CH#&-MeOH-18M NH,OH (1OO:lO:l). A 
chromatographically homogeneous (TLC) fraction contained 
30 mg of 1 (yield 92%). This material was identical to the plant 
derived alkaloid (TLC, HPLC, ‘H and “C NMR, IR and 
EI-MS).
