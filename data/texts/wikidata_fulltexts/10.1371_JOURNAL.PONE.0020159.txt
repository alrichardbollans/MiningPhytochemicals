Abstract
Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with a five-year overall survival rate of only 15%.
Cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) is a human oncoprotein inhibiting PP2A in many human malignancies. However,
whether CIP2A can be a new drug target for lung cancer is largely unclear.
Methodology/PrincipalFindings:Normal and malignantlungtissues werederivedfrom 60lungcancer patientsfrom southern
China. RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of CIP2A. We found that
among the 60 patients, CIP2A was undetectable or very low in paratumor normal tissues, but was dramatically elevated in
tumor samples in 38 (63.3%) patients. CIP2A overexpression was associated with cigarette smoking. Silencing CIP2A by siRNA
inhibited theproliferationand clonogenicactivityoflungcancercells.Intriguingly, wefound anaturalcompound,rabdocoetsin
B which is extracted from a Traditional Chinese Medicinal herb Rabdosia coetsa, could induce down-regulation of CIP2A and
inactivation of Akt pathway, and inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of lung cancer cells.
Conclusions/Significance: Our findings strongly indicate that CIP2A could be an effective target for lung cancer drug
development, and the therapeutic potentials of CIP2A-targeting agents warrant further investigation.

Introduction
Nearly 1.5 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer and 1.4
million people were estimated to die from it in 2007 [1]. The two major
forms of lung cancer are non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
small cell lung cancer (SCLC). About 85% of lung cancers are
NSCLC, which can be divided into three major histological subtypes:
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma.
SCLC represents about 15% of lung cancers [2]. Smoking causes all
types of lung cancer but is most strongly linked with SCLC and
squamous-cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma is the most common type
in patients who have never smoked [2]. Current treatment is
determined by the histologic type of lung cancer and stage at diagnosis,
including surgery, platinum doublet therapy, radiation therapy and
targeted therapy. Unfortunately, the prognosis of lung cancer is poor
with a only 15% of five-year overall survival rate for all stages
combined [1]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify more
effective molecular targets and new targeted therapies for lung cancer.
Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) is a human oncoprotein
that stabilizes c-Myc by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-
mediated dephosphorylationofMYCatserine62[3].Inadditionto
inhibiting the degradation of c-Myc, CIP2A appears to be regulated
in a positive feedback loop with c-Myc by promoting each other’s
expression [4]. CIP2A is over-expressed in human neck and head
carcinomas, colon, breast, and gastric cancer, and is inversely
correlated with disease outcome in gastric cancer [3–7]. However,
whether CIP2A could be a new drug target for cancers is not fully
investigated, and the anti-tumor activity of CIP2A-targeting agents
remains largely unknown. We studied the expression of CIP2A in
lung cancer and screened for lead compounds that could target
CIP2A [8]. Here we show that CIP2A is markedly upregulated in
lung cancer tumors compared to patient-matched adjacent normal
lung tissues, and report that a natural compound which triggers
downregulation of CIP2A exhibits significant antitumor activity in
NSCLC cell lines.
Results
CIP2A is over-expressed in lung cancer and is associated
with cigarette smoking
We tested the expression of CIP2A at protein level in
nonmalignant and malignant cells, and found that CIP2A was
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20159highly expressed in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1975, 95D and
L78) compared to normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HLF
and MRC5) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBEpiC) (Figure 1A). We then analyzed CIP2A in 60 lung
cancer samples from patients came from southern China whose
baseline characteristics were listed in Table 1. We showed that
CIP2A was over-expressed in 38 (63.3%) tumor specimens assayed
by western blotting (Figure 1B). However, in the 60 patient-
matched adjacent normal lung tissues, CIP2A was undetectable in
57 (95%) samples, and was weakly expressed in 3 (5%) specimens
where its expression was much lower than that in tumor samples of
the same patients. In samples from 2 patients with inflammatory
pseudotumor, CIP2A was not detected in both the pseudotumor
and adjacent lung tissues (Figure 1C). Immunohistochemistry

CIP2A in Lung Cancer
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20159assay confirmed that CIP2A was dramatically elevated with a
higher immunoreactivity score in tumor samples in 26 out of 39
patients (66.7%) tested (Figure 1D). At mRNA level, CIP2A was
also over-expressed in lung tumor tissues compared to normal lung
tissues in 39 of 58 (67.2%) patients tested (Figure 1E). Taken
together, CIP2A is dramatically elevated in lung cancer tumor
samples compared to paired normal lung tissues.
CIP2A overexpression is associated with cigarette
smoking
We analyzed the correlation between CIP2A overexpression and
some clinicopathologic variables. The data demonstrated that CIP2A
overexpression in lung cancer was significantly correlated with
histologic type of squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.003) and male
gender (p=0.008) (Table 1) that were shown to strongly link with
cigarette smoking [2,9]. Moreover, our data clearly showed that the
high expression of CIP2A was associated with smoker patients
(p=0.004). No significant difference in the CIP2A status was
observed according to the pathological stage (p=0.639) and age
(0.082) (Table 1). In an attempt to clarify the most significant factors
related to CIP2A overexpression, the multivariate analyses were
performed, and the multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 2)
demonstrated that cigarette smoking was the only significant variable
associated with CIP2A overexpression in lung cancer (p=0.008).
The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitro-samino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-buta-
none, or the nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), is a
key ingredient of tobacco smoke carcinogen which systemically
induces tumors of the lung in rats, mice, and hamsters and also
plays a major role in lung carcinogenesis [10,11]. We then
investigated whether NNK could directly induce upregulation of
CIP2A or not. To do this, HBEpiC (Figure 2A) and BEAS-2B
(Figure 2B) bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to NNK at
indicated concentration for indicated time points, lysed, and
western blot was performed to analyze the expression of CIP2A.
The results showed that treatment with NNK at 0.1 to 10 mM for
up to 18 days could not perturb CIP2A expression (Figure 2, A
and B). In this study, we did not test the long-term effect of NNK
on CIP2A expression in vitro or in vivo.
CIP2A is required for lung cancer cells growth and
transformation
CIP2A specific siRNA was employed to evaluate its roles in lung
cancer pathogenesis, and the results showed that as compared to
negative control (NC), CIP2A silencing (Figure 3A) led to
inhibition of clonogenic activity of A549 cells, detected by foci
formation (Figure 3, B and C) and soft agar colony formation
(Figure 3, D and E) assays [3]. These phenomena were confirmed
by results of CIP2A silencing in L78 cells (Figure S1, A through E).
Next, A549 cells were transfected with NC or CIP2A-specific
siRNA (Figure 3F), and injected subcutaneously into the right and
left flanks of 8 nude mice respectively, and tumor volumes were
estimated every two days [12]. Interestingly, CIP2A-specific
siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared to NC-
siRNA (Figure 3, G through I). Together, these data indicate that
CIP2A is essential to lung cancer proliferation and tumorigenesis,
and could be an effective therapeutic target.
Rabdocoetsin B is a CIP2A-targeting natural compound
Our central goal was to identify new drug targets and provide
lead compounds for drug development. We screened for CIP2A-
targeting small molecules by analyzing their effects on CIP2A
expression, and identified a natural compound extracted from a
Chinese medicinal herbal Rabdosia coetsa, rabdocoetsin B [13,14]
(Figure 4A), could downregulate CIP2A at protein level at 5 to
20 mM in A549 cells (Figure 4B). In H1975 cells, Rabdocoetsin B
also triggered downregulation of CIP2A at 5 to 10 mM (Figure 4C).
We analyzed the mechanism of CIP2A down-regulation caused by
Rabdocoetsin B, and found that rabdocoetsin B significantly
inhibited the transcription of CIP2A in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4D) assessed by real-time RT-PCR.
Rabdocoetsin B inhibits CIP2A-modulated
phosphorylated Akt
In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, CIP2A up-regulates phospho-
Akt (pAkt) and decreases Akt-related PP2A activity, whereas
silencing CIP2A re-activates PP2A [15]. Since Akt is constitutively
active in lung cancer cells and promotes cellular survival and
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation [16,17], we examined

CIP2A in Lung Cancer
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20159the effect of CIP2A on pAkt in lung cancer. We showed that
CIP2A silencing by specific siRNA resulted in down-regulation of
pAkt but not pERK, PCNA, b-catenin, EGFR or Src (Figure 5A).
We then investigated whether rabdocoetsin B could modulate the
expression of pAkt, and found that treatment with rabdocoetsin B
at 5 to 10 mM also down-regulated pAkt in A549 (Figure 5B) and
H1975 (Figure 5C) cells. We further showed that in H1975 cells
upon rabdocoetsin B at 10 mM, CIP2A was markedly downreg-
ulated in 6 to 12 h and became undetectable in 48 h (Figure 5D),
while pAKT was decreased in 18 h (Figure 5D). These results
were confirmed in A549 cells treated with rabdocoetsin B
(Figure 5E), indicating that this compound can inhibit the
CIP2A-Akt pathway in lung cancer.
Effects of Rabdocoetsin B on lung cancer cells
We evaluated the effects of rabdocoetsin B on lung cancer cells
expressing wide-type (WT) or mutant EGFR. We showed that
rabdocoetsin B exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on A549, NCI-
H1975, HCC827, SPC-A-1, GLC-82, L78 and 95D lung cancer
cell lines (Figure 6, A and B). Rabdocoetsin B induced apoptosis of
A549 cells (Figure 6C) with activation of casp-8 and casp-9 and
cleavage of PARP (Figure 6D). Rabdocoetsin B also caused
activation of casp-8 and casp-9 and cleavage of PARP in NCI-
H1975 cells (Figure 6E). These results indicate that rabdocoetsin B
inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells via
activating the endogenous and exogenous apoptosis pathways.
Discussion
CIP2A is an auto-antigen [7] that is over-expressed in human
neoplasms [3–7,18–21]. Peng [22] showed that in American-based
patients, CIP2A is increased in 61 of the 72 (84.7%) lung cancer
tissue specimens, which is significantly higher than in normal lung
tissues (14.3%, 9/63). Recently, Dong et al [23] reported that in
29 patients from Northern China, CIP2A is over-expressed at
mRNA level in 24 cases (82.7%) in tumor samples compared with
their corresponding normal tissues; CIP2A protein (detected by
immunohistochemistry) is found to be over-expressed in 72.2% of
90 lung cancer samples and correlated with poor survival. We test
CIP2A expression in 60 patients from Southern China [8], and
report that CIP2A is drastically increased in 63.3% (detected by
western blotting) or 67.2% (at mRNA level) of tumor specimens
compared to adjacent normal tissues (Figure 1).
We show for the first time that CIP2A overexpression is
associated with cigarette smoking. In the 60 lung cancer patients
examined in this study, 28 of 36 (77.8%) smoker patients show
increased expression of CIP2A in the tumor samples compared to
their adjacent normal specimens, whereas 10 of 24 (41.7%)
nonsmoker cases exhibit up-regulated CIP2A at protein level
(p=0.004) (Table 1). Currently smoking continues to be more
prevalent among men (63%) than women (3.8%) [24]. We report
here that CIP2A is over-expressed in 30/40 (75%) and 8/20 (40%)
in men and women patients (p=0.008) (Table 1), respectively. We
also find that CIP2A is elevated in 17/19 (89.5%) patients with
squamous cell carcinoma, whereas 17/35 (48.6%) patients with
adenocarcinoma have over-expressed CIP2A (p=0.003) (Table 1).
The multivariate logistic regression analysis clearly demonstrates
that smoking is the only significant variable associated with CIP2A
overexpression in lung cancer in our setting (p=0.008) (Table 2).
While the overall smoking rate in the North and Northeast sectors is
higher than that in the South and East of China, the prevalence of
environmental tobacco smoke exposure among nonsmokers in
Northern China is significantly higher than that in nonsmokers in
Southern China [24,25]. These may contribute to the difference in
CIP2A expression betweenpatients inour setting and Dong’sreport
[23]. Tobacco smoke which causes approximately 5–6 million
deaths per year and 31% and 6% of all lung cancer deaths in
middle-aged men and women respectively [26], can induce genetic
and epigenetic changes and reduce DNA repair capacity [2]. Zhao
etal[27] recentlyshowedthatinhumangastriccell lines,Helicobacter
pylori infection can induce CIP2A expression via bacterial
oncoprotein CagA-caused activation of the Src and MEK/ERK
signal pathways. Though NNK (0.1 to 50 mM) fails to upregulate
CIP2A in HBEpiC and BEAS-2B cells in up to 18 days in our study
(Figure 2),we cannot exclude the possibility that NNK may perturb
the expression of the oncoprotein in a longer exposure time course,
and this hypothesis warrants further investigation.
CIP2A is critical for lung cancer cell growth, since CIP2A
knockdown by specific siRNA results in significant inhibition of cell
proliferation and transformation in vitro and in vivo (Figure 3 and
Figure S1). These data indicate that CIP2A could be an attractive
target for novel anti-lung cancer drugs. Interestingly, we identify a
naturalcompoundrabdocoetsinB, candown-regulateCIP2Aprotein
in lung cancer cells (Figure 4, A through C) by inhibiting its
expression at mRNA level (Figure 4D). Studies show that CIP2A can
up-regulate pAkt [15], and our results confirm that CIP2A silencing
can decrease pAkt (Figure 5A). We further show that rabdocoetsin B
alsoinhibits pAkt(Figure 5, B throughE). Rabdocoetsin B inhibits the
growth and induces apoptosis of a variety of lung cancer cells
(Figure 6, A through E). Our data thus provide a lead compound for
CIP2A-targeting anti-tumor therapeutics.

and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
Assessment of cell proliferation and apoptosis
Cells were treated with Rabdocoetsin B for indicated concen-
tration and time points. Cell proliferation was determined using
MTT assay. Cell viability was estimated by trypan blue dye
exclusion. Externalization of phosphatidylserine was tested using a

CIP2A in Lung Cancer
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20159PE Annexin V-7 AAD Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in CFX
TM96 Real
Time System (Bio-Rad) using SYBRH Premix Ex Taq
TM(Perfect
Real Time) (TaKaRa Code: DRR041) according to the manu-
facturer’s instruction. Primers for CIP2A and Actin were as
follows: CIP2A: forward sequence, 59-TGCGGCACTTGGAG-
GTAATTTC-39, reverse sequence, 59-AGCTCTACAAGGCA-
ACTCAAGC-39; Actin: forward sequence, 59-ATCGTCCA-
CCGCAAATGCTTCTA-39, reverse sequence, 59-AGCCATGC-
CAATCTCATCTTGTT-39. Levels of CIP2A mRNA were
expressed as the ratio versus actin based on the CT values.
siRNA assays
Using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, cells were transfected
with 100 nM double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides [3]. The
siRNA sequences were 59-CUGUGGUUGUGUUUGCACUTT-
39 (CIP2A siRNA1), 59-ACCAUUGAUAUCCUUAGAATT-39
(CIP2A siRNA2) [3], and 59-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCAC-
GUTT-39 (negative control (NC) siRNA).
Clonogenic assay
For foci formation, A549 or L78 cells transfected with negative
control or CIP2A-specific siRNA were seeded in triplicate onto
35 mm plates (300 cells per plate). After 14 days of culturing, cells
were stained with Giemsa and clones containing more than 50
cells were counted. For soft-agar colony formation assay, cells were
suspended in 1 ml DMEM (for A549 cells) or RPMI 1640 (for L78
cells) containing 0.3% low-melting-point agarose (Amresco, Solon,
OH) and 10% FBS and plated on a bottom layer containing 0.6%
agarose in 35 mm plat (1,000 cells/plate) in triplicate. After 2-3
weeks culturing, plates were stained with Giemsa and colonies
were counted using a light microscope.
Murine models
All animal studies were conducted according to protocols
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the approval ID of
AEC2010070202. All mice used in this study were bred and
maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment. Nude mice
(n=8) were injected subcutaneously with A549 cells (4610
6)
transfected with NC or CIP2A-specific siRNA into right and left
flanks respectively, and tumor was calculated as described [12].
Statistical analysis
Differences between data groups were evaluated for significance
using Student t-test of unpaired data, x
2 test or one-way analysis of
variance and Bonferroni post-test. The tumor volume was
analyzed with one-way ANOVA and independent sample t test
using the software SPSS 12.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL). The
association between CIP2A high expression and clinicopatholog-
ical feature was assessed using either x
2 test or the Fisher exact test,
and a backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis
was carried out to investigate the most significant variables related
to CIP2A over-expression after adjustment. P values ,.05 were
considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated
at least three times and the data were presented as the mean6SD
unless noted otherwise.
