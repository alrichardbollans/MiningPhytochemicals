Two new sulfated cadinene-type sesquiterpene glycosides, 13-hydroxy-7-O-(60-O-sulfate-b-D-glucopyra-
nosyl)-desoxyhemigossypol (1) and 13,15-dihydroxy-7-O-(60-O-sulfate-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-desoxy-
hemigossypol (2), have been isolated from whole cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum). Their structures,
which possess an unusual 6-O-sulfate-glucopyranosyl moiety, were determined through the in-
terpretation of 2D NMR spectral data and H/D exchange ESI-MS experiments. Compounds 1 and 2 were
screened for their toxicity on Jurkat cells. Both compounds inhibited cellular proliferationwith IC50 values
of 8.1 and 4.2 mg, respectively.

1. Introduction
Cotton (Gossypium spp.) produces a large group of sesquiter-
penes with the cadinane carbon skeleton that includes desoxy-
hemigossypol (dHG), hemigossypol (HG), gossypol (G),
hemigossypolone (HGQ),1 and the heliocides H1, H2, H3, and H4
(Fig. 1).2 Unstressed Gossypium plants accumulate many of these
compounds in subepidermal glands of all green tissues, which
deter herbivores, and in epidermal cells of roots, probably as de-
fense against soilborne pathogens.3 Various sesquiterpenoid cadi-
nanes are also elicited by fungal and bacterial infection, by toxic
chemicals, and by cold stress.4,5 Of the phytoalexins, which accu-
mulate in stem stele of Verticilliumwilt-resistant cotton in response
to Verticillium dahliae infection, Mace et al. have shown that dHG
has the highest antifungal activity.6 Recently, however, it has been
reported that gossypol and its metabolite, gossypolone, have anti-
cancer effects in animal models.7,8
Whole cottonseed (WCS) is the unprocessed and unadulterated
oilseed, which has been separated from the cotton ﬁber. Cotton-
seeds are fed to high-producing dairy cows as a source of fat and
highly digestible ﬁber. They are also used as a forage replacer.
Secondary metabolites in WCS have been studied because some
components have been blamed for anti-nutritive or toxic effects:9,10
gossypol is the main anti-nutrient limiting the use of cottonseed in
monogastric animals and humans, where it acts by reducing the
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and results in shortness of
breath and of edema of the lungs.11 Also, ﬂavonoids have recently
been reported in WCS.12,13 The occurrence of this type of secondary
metabolite in food and feed is highly desirable because they con-
tribute to their nutritional value.
In the course of our continuing search for novel secondary
metabolites of biomedical and ecological importance we in-
vestigated the terpenoids of whole cottonseed. Two new com-
pounds,1 and 2, with an unusual 6-O-sulfate-glucopyranosyl group
were isolated as minor components (Fig. 2). The structures of these
compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods
including 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D NMR experiments (DQF-COSY,
HSQC, HMBC, NOESY) as well as ESI-MS analysis and H/D exchange
MS experiments. Compounds 1 and 2 were tested for cytotoxicity
against Jurkat cells a human lymphoblastoid T cell line usually
utilized for studies of immunotoxicity in vitro.
To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report of the oc-
currence of glycosylated cadinene-type sesquiterpene in Gossipium.
Compounds 1 and 2 are structurally related to desoxyhemigossypol
(dHG), a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of cotton terpenoid,1
and are probably derived through the same biosynthetic pathway.

There has been only two publications with reference to the struc-
tural characterization of dHG and these two studies did not report
13C NMR data for dHG.14,15 Compounds 1 and 2, which, respectively,
bear one and two oxygenated methylene substituent on naphtha-
lene ring, instead of methyl groups present in dHG, were fully
characterized by NMR and spectral data reported herein could be
useful for the future NMR assessment of cotton terpenoids.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. NMR structure elucidation of 1 and 2
Compound 1 showed absorption bands for hydroxyl
(3390 cm1), aromatic (1681 cm1), and sulfate (1211 cm1) groups
in its IR spectrum. The ()-ESI-MS spectrum of 1 showed as base
peak the pseudomolecular ion [MH] at m/z 501 and its MS/MS
spectrum gave ions at m/z 421 [MH80] and m/z 259
[MH80162], which indicated the presence of a sulfate
(–OSO3H) or phosphate (–OPO3H2) group and a hexose. The HRESI-
MS of compound 1 showed an [MH] ion peak at m/z 501.1100,
consistent with the molecular formula C21H26O12S.
The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 21 carbon signals (Table 1),
6 of which could be assigned to a hexose moiety. Aglycon signals
including 10 carbons in the range dC 101–163 ppm, ascribable to
a naphthalene ring with two directly attached hydrogen atoms,
according to HSQC and HMBC spectra, an oxygenatedmethylene (dC
77.19 ppm), a methyne (dC 36.87 ppm), and a tertiary and a sec-
ondary methyl group. All the information mentioned above was in
support of compound 1 being a sesquiterpene glycoside. Inspection
of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 led to the identiﬁcation of the fol-
lowing representative signals: a methyl doublet signal protons at
d 1.46 (d, J¼6.9 Hz), a methyl singlet protons at d 2.84, a methyne
proton at d 3.73 (m), two oxymethylene protons at d 4.03 (m), two
protons of a further oxymethylene groups linked directly at the
naphthalene ring (d 5.82 and 5.90; J¼15.3 Hz), and two meta-re-
lated doublets (d 6.34 and 7.06; J¼1.5 Hz). The 1H NMR spectrum

also indicated an anomeric proton at d 4.71 (1H, d, J¼7.5 Hz) and
signals in the d 3.54–4.43 region attributable to a sugar moiety. The
1H and 13C NMR data of the key hydrogens and carbons (C-20, C-30,
and C-50) indicated a b-conﬁguration at the anomeric position
(JH-10–H-20¼7.5 Hz). The sugar substituent was identiﬁed as b-
glucopyranosyl from the 1D-TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and HSQC spectra.
The 13C NMR signal of C-60 (d 68.18) of the glucopyranosyl group
was downﬁeld with respect to those in unsubstituted glucose
(DdC-60¼ca.þ6 ppm) as expected for a 6-O-substituted glucosyl
moiety. The inorganic nature of this substituent was deduced from
the lack of further carbon resonances. The IR, MS, and NMR (ab-
sence of 31P–13C coupling in 13C NMR spectra) data strongly sug-
gested that this substituent is a sulfate ester of OH-60. A further
conﬁrmation of C-60–OSO3H substitution was obtained with H/D
exchange ESI-MS experiments (see Section 2.2).
The 1H–1H COSY spectrum of 1 showed proton correlations
between dH 1.46 (Me-14) and dH 3.73 (H-12), between H-12
and protons at dH 3.98 and 4.03 (H2-13), indicating the presence of
a –CH3–CH–CH2OH chain together with the spin system belonging
to the glucose moiety. The HSQC spectrum of 1 indicated all of the
protonated carbon correlations, thereby leading to the elucidation
of the structural skeleton. These results clearly showed that 1 was
closely related to desoxyhemigossypol, except for the oxidation of
isopropyl group and the presence of the sugar residue. HMBC cor-
relations (H-12/C-6 and C-10, H2-11/C-1, C-7 and C-9, H-4/C-2, C-5
and C-9, Me-15/C-4 and C-2 and H-10/C-7) conﬁrmed the position
of the isopropanol group at C-5 and the glycosidic linkage at the C-7
position of the naphthalene ring and indicated that the methylene
C-11 was connected via oxygen at C-1 position. In addition, the
correlation of H-4 with H-12 in the ROESY spectrum showed them
to be in the peri position and allowed us to discriminate between
the two meta coupled protons, in consequence, the remaining
proton at dH 6.34 could be assigned as H-2. On the basis of these
spectral data, the structure of 1 was identiﬁed as 13-hydroxy-7-O-
(60-O-sulfate-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-desoxyhemigossypol (Fig. 2).
Compound 2 showed similar IR absorption bands and ESI-MS
behavior ([MH] at m/z 517 and fragment ions at m/z 437
[MH80] andm/z 275 [MH80162]) of compound 1. It was
assigned a molecular formula of C21H26O13S as deduced by HRESI-
MS ([MH] ion peak a m/z 517.1057) and 13C NMR and DEPT
analysis. In the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, all of the proton and carbon
signals of 2 were almost superimposable on those of 1 (Table 1),
except for the appearance of a further oxymethylene group (d 4.69
and 66.49 in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively) and loss of
one methyl group. The 13C NMR signals of C-4 and C-2 were shifted
upﬁeld by 1.14 and 2.50 ppm, respectively, and C-3 was shifted
downﬁeld by 3.64 ppm, taking into account 1 as reference com-
pound. These data suggested that the oxymethylene group is lo-
cated at C-3. The sugar moiety of compound 2 exhibited a good
coincidence with those of 1 in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. From all
these data compound 2 was identiﬁed as 13,15-dihydroxy-7-O-(60-
O-sulfate-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-desoxyhemigossypol (Fig. 2).
Compounds 1 and 2 appeared to be the ﬁrst example of sulfated
cadinene-type sesquiterpene glycosides in Gossipium.
2.2. H/D exchange ESI-MS experiments on 1 and 2
Some natural products and metabolites contain one or more
sulfate or phosphate groups. Sulfo compounds have been identiﬁed
from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Recently, many
reports have conﬁrmed the presence of the sulfate ester only from
the results of hydrolysis by sulfatase and low-resolution mass
spectrometry (LRMS) analysis with a fragment loss of 80 mass
units.16 However, phosphate esters also give the same fragment
loss and the difference between sulfate and phosphate in their
exact masses is only 0.009 mass units, which is in the range of
technical errors (m/z0.01) of conventional high-resolution mass
spectrometer.
Kanakubo et al. reported that daidzein-7-O-phosphate and
genistein-7-O-phosphate were surprisingly hydrolyzed by sulfa-
tase,17 they developed a method to distinguish phosphate from
sulfate group by H/D exchange MS with a low-resolution mass
spectrometer (FABMS and Q-TOF).18 This method was based on the
different numbers of exchangeable protons between sulfate and
phosphate groups. After these protons are exchanged for deuterium
atoms, the mass difference between phosphate and sulfate should
shift from 0.009 to 1.016 mass units,18 and, in the negative ion
mode, anionic phosphate species should have one deuterium atom
but sulfate none. The difference of 1 nominal mass unit is very easy
to distinguish by LRMS.
We applied this method to distinguish between sulfate and
phosphate by LRMS using ion trap mass spectrometers. Compounds
1 and 2with sulfate as substituent contain ﬁve and six exchangeable
protons and should give a 5 and 6 mass units increase, respectively,
with a neutral loss of 80 mass units, while, the same compounds
with a phosphate group (six and seven exchangeable protons)
should give a 6 and7mass units increase, respectively, and a 81 mass
units loss. When compounds 1 and 2 were analyzed in the deute-
rium-exchange, they showed the [MD] peaks atm/z 506 and 523,
respectively (Fig. 3). The ()-ESI-MS spectra displayed also peaks at
m/z 505 and 504, for 1, and atm/z 522, 521 and 520 for 2, whichwere
due to the fact that the H/D exchange was not completed. This data
suggested the presence of a sulfate group, which was conﬁrmed by
fragment ions in the MS/MS spectra of peaks at m/z 506 and 523
corresponding at neutral loss of 80 mass units (Fig. 3). Thus, in ac-
cordance with the spectroscopic data reported above, the C-60–
OSO3H substitution of compounds 1 and 2was ulteriorly conﬁrmed.
These results demonstrate that H/D exchange MS with a low-
resolution mass spectrometer is a convenient method to distin-
guish betweenphosphate and sulfate at the picomole level andmay
provide an alternative to classical and not rigorous hydrolysis by
sulfatase.
2.3. Cell proliferation assay
In our study, we assessed the effects of compounds 1 and 2 on
the proliferation of Jurkat T cells. We incubated cells with different
doses (from 0.5 to 420 mg/ml) of both compounds and we found
that both compounds were cytotoxic at highest doses. To assess the
effects of methanol, in which compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved,
on cellular proliferation, we incubated Jurkat cells with different
concentrations of alcohol (0.5–420 mg/ml). We also calculated
the IC50 values for both compounds and we found that IC50 of
compound 1 was 8.1 mg while the IC50 of compound 2 was 4.2 mg.
3. Experimental
3.1. General methods
Unless speciﬁed, solvents were reagent grade. They were pur-
chased from Aldrich or Fluka or Carlo Erba and were used without
further puriﬁcation. Optical rotations were measured on a Jasco
DIP-370 polarimeter equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and
a 10 cm microcell. UV spectra were obtained with a Beckman DU
670 spectrophotometer and IR spectra with a Biorad FTS 155 FT-IR
spectrophotometer. A Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer, operating at
599.19 MHz for 1H and 150.858 MHz for 13C, using the UXNMR
software package was used for NMR experiments in CDCl3.
1H–1H
DQF-COSY (Double Quantum Filtered COSY), 1H–13C HSQC, HMBC,
and ROESY experiments were obtained using conventional pulse
sequences. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
was performed using a LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer

(Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with Xcalibur 3.1 soft-
ware. Samples were dissolved in MeOH/H2O 1:1 and infused in the
ESI source by using a syringe pump at a ﬂow rate of 3 mL/min. The
ionization conditions were optimized, and the parameters were
maintained as follows: capillary temperature 160 C, capillary
voltage36 V, spray voltage 5.0 kV, tube lens voltage65 V, sheath
gas ﬂow rate 30 (arbitrary units), scan range ofm/z 150–1000 amu.
N2 was used as the sheath and auxiliary gas. Data were acquired in
the full MS and MS/MS scan modes. Exact masses were measured
by a Q-TOF premier (Waters, Maniford, MA, USA) high-resolution
mass spectrometer. Column chromatographies were performed
over Sephadex LH-20 (1 m3 cm i.d; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).
HPLC separations were performed on a Waters 590 series pumping
system equipped with a Waters R401 refractive index detector and
a Kromasil C18 10 mm (30010 mm) column.
3.2. Plant material
Unstressed Gossypium hirsutumwas grown in the ﬁeld at Cereal
Comm Feed Company (Brescia, Italy). Whole cottonseed is a by-
product of cotton production and acreage is expanding in the North
Italy. Whole cottonseed (WCS) was furnished by Cereal Comm Feed
Company.
3.3. Extraction and isolation procedure
The dried and powdered WCS (405 g) were defatted with hex-
ane and CHCl3 and then extracted with MeOH to give 19 g of resi-
due. The MeOH extract was partitioned between n-BuOH and H2O
to afford an n-BuOH soluble portion (5.8 g), which was chromato-
graphed twice on a Sephadex LH-20. The fraction with the

3.4. H/D exchange MS of 1 and 2
Compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in deuterium oxide (D2O)
and kept at 20 C for 4 h and lyophilized. This process was repeated
two times. The samples for MS experiments were dissolved in D2O
(5 mg/ml) and directly sprayed at 3 ml/min. An ion trap mass spec-
trometer equipped with an ESI source was used for H/D exchange
experiments and the ionization conditions were the same reported
in the general methods. Before analysis the mass spectrometer was
conditioned with D2O.
3.5. Cells proliferation assay
3.5.1. Reagents
RPMI-1640 medium, L-glutamine, streptomycin, penicillin, fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and non-essential aminoacids were purchased
from Cambrex Bioproducts Europe (Verviers, Belgium).
3.5.2. Cell culture
Jurkat T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 C in
a humidiﬁed atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2/95% air in RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin,
and 1% (w/v) non-essential aminoacids. Cells were kept in the
exponential growth phase by passages at 2–3 days interval.
3.5.3. Cell proliferation assay
Cells were cultured in ﬂat bottom 96-well plates (4104/well)
for 72 h in the presence of different concentrations of two com-
pounds 1 and 2. The compounds are both dissolved in methanol.
Eighteen hours prior to harvesting, cells were pulsed with 1 mCi/
well [3H]-thymidine. Cultures were harvested on ﬁlters using
a semiautomatic cell harvester (Filtermate, Packard, Danvers, MA).
[3H]-Thymidine incorporation was assessed by a microplate liquid
scintillator (Top Count NXT, Packard, Danvers, MA). Results were
expressed as cpm (counts per minute).
3.5.4. Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to compare results from three different
experiments. Results were expressed as meanSD. Statistical
signiﬁcance between treated and non-treated cells with gossypol
derivates was reached when P values were 0.05.
