CmaraCentro de Qumica da Madeira,Departamento de Qumica,Universidade da Madeira,Campus Universitrio daPenteada, Funchal, PortugalOriginal PaperCharacterization of volatile substances in applesfromRosaceae family by headspace solid-phasemicroextraction followed by GC-qMSThe volatile composition of different apple varieties of Malus domestica Borkh. speciesfrom different geographic regions at Madeira Islands, namely Ponta do Pargo (PP),Porto Santo (PS), and Santo da Serra (SS) was established by headspace solid-phasemicroextraction (HS-SPME) procedure followed by GC-MS (GC-qMS) analysis. Signifi-cant parameters affecting sorption process such as fiber coating, extraction tempera-ture, extraction time, sample amount, dilution factor, ionic strength, and desorptiontime, were optimized and discussed. The SPME fiber coatedwith 50/30 lmdivinylben-zene/carboxen/PDMS (DVB/CAR/PDMS) afforded highest extraction efficiency of vola-tile compounds, providing the best sensitivity for the target volatiles, particularlywhen the samples were extracted at 508C for 30 min with constant magnetic stirring.A qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis between the investigated apple specieshas been established. It was possible to identify about 100 of volatile compoundsamong pulp (46, 45, and 39), peel (64, 60, and 64), and entire fruit (65, 43, and 50) in PP,PS, and SS apples, respectively. Ethyl esters, terpenes, and higher alcohols were foundto be themost representative volatiles. a-Farnesene, hexan-1-ol and hexyl 2-methylbu-tyratewere the compounds found in the volatile profile of studied appleswith the larg-estGCarea, representing, on average, 24.71, 14.06, and10.80%of the total volatile frac-tion fromPP, PS, andSSapples. In PP entire apple, themost abundant compounds iden-tified were a-farnesene (30.49%), the unknown compound m/z (69, 101, 157) (21.82%)and hexyl acetate (6.57%). Regarding PS entire apple themajor compounds were a-far-nesene (16.87%), estragole (15.43%), hexan-1-ol (10.94), and E-2-hexenal (10.67). a-Farne-sene (30.3%), hexan-1-ol (18.90%), 2-methylbutanoic acid (4.7%), and pentan-1-ol (4.6%)were also found as SS entire apple volatiles present in a higher relative content. Princi-pal component analysis (PCA) of the results clustered the apples into three groupsaccording to geographic origin. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed inorder to detect the volatile compounds able to differentiate the three kinds of applesinvestigated. The most important contributions to the differentiation of the PP, PS,and SS apples were ethyl hexanoate, hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, E,E-2,4-heptadienal, p-ethyl styrene, and E-2-hexenal.Keywords: Apples / GC-qMS /Malus domestica Borkh. / Solid-phasemicroextraction / Volatile profile/Received: January 14, 2009; revised: March 11, 2009; accepted: March 11, 2009DOI 10.1002/jssc.2009000241 IntroductionFrom hybrid origin, the apple tree from Malus domesticaBorkh.

Ferreira et al. J. Sep. Sci. 2009, 32, 1875–1888tile compounds are of the utmost importance on theestablishment of fruit quality criteria and especially ondetermining consumer acceptance. Apple aroma profilesare complex since, they are constituted by a large num-ber of volatile compounds (volatile organic compound(VOCs)) that contributed to the overall sensory quality.Over 300 VOCs have been measured in the aroma profileof apples. These compounds include carboxylic esters,alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, and ethers, but justabout 20 of these chemicals are character impact com-pounds. Some are present in very low concentrationsand contribute potent aroma characteristics typical ofapple flavor (e.g., ethyl 2-methyl butyrate). Others con-tribute to the aroma intensity (e.g., E-2-hexenal) or arerelated to aroma quality (alcohols). The contribution ofeach volatile compound depends on both its odor thresh-old and their respective concentration that in turndepends on the activity of related enzymes and on sub-strate availability [1]. Therefore, the final aroma profileof a fruit is the result of a balance between all volatilecompounds emitted and any modification in this finebalance would result in changes in the fruit flavor [2].The volatile composition of apples depends on severalfactors, mainly, cultivar, cultural practices, climactericconditions, and the state of fruit maturity [3]. Althoughthere is a great range of compounds in the volatile com-position of apples, the majority are carboxylic estersand higher alcohols [4–6]. The most abundant com-pounds are even numbered carbon chains includingcombinations of ethanoic, butanoic, and hexanoic acidswith ethyl, butyl, and hexyl alcohols. Ethyl esters,which are the most significant contributors to applearoma profile, being generated by esterification of alco-hols and acyl-CoA derived from fatty acids and aminoacid metabolism. Lipoxygenase enzyme has also beenreported to play an important role on the formation ofstraight-chain volatile aldehydes and alcohols througha number of different pathways. Other importantaroma compounds are branched-chain volatile com-pounds, which are derived from branch-chained aminoacids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as from ala-nine and aspartic acid. It has also been noticed thatfruits produce acetaldehyde and alcohol during theirmaturation and ripening [4, 6, 7]. However, only a fewvolatile compounds have a decisive impact on the sen-sory quality of apple fruits, such as ethyl acetate, ethylbutyrate, and methyl anthranilate [8]. The contributionof each volatile compound depends on both, its odorthreshold and their respective concentration that inturn depends on the activity of related enzymes and onsubstrate availability [1]. Therefore, the final aromaprofile of a fruit is the result of a balance between allvolatile compounds emitted and any modification inthis fine balance would result in changes in the fruitflavor [2].The development of analytical methodologies foraroma characterization of food products has been impor-tant for the identification of volatiles and understandingtheir role in aroma and organoleptic quality. Severalextraction techniques such as headspace, purge, andtrap, liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and SPE aredescribed in different studies; however, these methodsare based on the use of solvents and present some draw-backs such as possibility of sample contamination andthe loss of some important volatiles, depending on sol-vent selectivity and volatility, during the concentrationstep. Additionally they require large amounts of sample,are laborious and time consuming methods [9, 10]. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a solventless extractiontechnique that presents itself as an alternative to the con-ventional sample extraction techniques [9, 11] and more-over is faster and easier than solvent extractions and dis-tillations, as well as being highly reproducible and sensi-tive. Moreover a range of fiber coating are commerciallyavailable, providing specificity for a wide range of polar,nonpolar, volatile, and semivolatile compounds. Thistechnique has been applied to the analysis of volatile andnonvolatile compounds (in gaseous, solid, and liquidsamples) present in several matrixes and also for theanalysis of volatiles in a large variety of fruits, such asapples [1, 12–19], peaches [5], pears [5, 20], strawberries[9, 21], annonas [22], among others. Its suitability has alsobeen verified in the detection of characteristic aromas,off-flavors, pesticides, and even antibiotics in variousfood matrices, as for example, wine [10, 23–25], whisky[26], and beer [27].Since headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) is an equilibrium technique, it requires a previousoptimization of sampling conditions in order to obtainhigh recoveries of volatiles and good precision of themethod, since several parameters associated with theextraction process influence the extraction efficiency ofVOCs [24, 28]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to char-acterize the volatile (VOCs) and semi-volatile organiccompounds (SVOCs) composition of M. domestica Borkh.apple species cultivated at different geographical regionsin Madeira Islands namely Ponta do Pargo (PP), PortoSanto (PS), and Santo da Serra (SS), using HS-SPME fol-lowed by GC-MS (GC-qMS) analysis and identify possiblegeographic markers. A preliminary screening of sixfibers commercially available with different polaritieswas carried out in order to select the best suited coatingfor volatile extraction. Other experimental parametersthat might affect the HS-SPME methodology such asextraction time and temperature, ionic strength, sampleamount, dilution factor, and desorption time, were alsotested and evaluated. Multivariate techniques of dataanalysis – PCA and LDA – were employed, to establishdifferentiation criteria as a function of the apple varietyand to detect the volatile compounds able to differenti-i 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co.

To our knowl-edge, there are no reports in the literature on the aromacompounds of these apples species cultivated at MadeiraIsland.2 Materials andmethods2.1 Chemicals and reagentsBoth, the SPME commercial fibers and the SPME holderfor manual sampling were supplied by Supelco (Aldrich,Bellefonte, PA, USA). The reagents and solvents used inthis study were of analytical quality and HPLC grade,higher than 98%. Sodium chloride was purchased fromPanreac (Barcelone, Spain) and C8-C20 n-alkanes seriesfrom Sigma–Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Ultra purewater was obtained from aMilli-Q system (Millipore).2.2 Fruit samplesThe apple samples from PP, PS, and SS used in thisstudy were harvested at commercial maturity duringthe 2007 season and purchased from traditional localstores. The apples of each location were cleaned,deseeded, and the bulbs and talks were removed. Inorder to homogenize the apple samples (pulp, peel, andentire fruit) each piece of fruit was cut into small piecesand immediately transferred into a domestic blender.An amount (3%, w/va) of calcium chloride (CaCl2) wasadded to inhibit the enzyme activity. The mixture wasstored in glass vials at –208C until analysis. All analyseswere carried out in triplicate.2.3 HS-SPME optimizationThe HS-SPME experimental parameters such as fiber coat-ing, extraction temperature and time, sample amount,dilution factor (water volume), ionic strength, and de-sorption time were systematically evaluated. To assessthe effects of these experimental factors on the extrac-tion efficiency of VOCS, the number of the tentativelyidentified compounds and the total peak areas were usedas parameters to optimize the methodology. The optimi-zation of the dynamic headspace method of extractionwas done with PP apple pulp.Six fibers were used to evaluate the effect of differentcoatings on the extraction efficiency of VOCs and SVOCsfrom apple samples: carbowax-divinylbenzene (CW/DVB,70 lm), DVB/carboxen (CAR)/PDMS (50:30 lm), CAR/PDMS (75 lm), polyacrylate (PA, 85 lm), PDMS/DVB(65 lm), and PDMS (100 lm). Prior to use, fibers wereconditioned according to the manufactures' instruc-tions. Then, each fiber was exposed to the headspace ofa 4 mL septum-sealed glass vial containing 0.50 g of sam-ple, 0.50 mL of water, and 0.10 g of NaCl at the sametemperature and time (308C and 30 min, respectively)under constant magnetic stirring of 800 rpm. Beforesampling, each fiber was reconditioned for 15 min inthe GC injection port at 2508C to eliminate possibleremains on the coating. The optimization of the otherexperimental parameters was performed with extrac-tions at different temperatures (30, 40, and 508C), times(15, 30, 60, and 75 min), sample amounts (0.50, 0.75,and 1.00 g), water volumes (0.50, 1.00, and 1.50 mL),NaCl amounts (0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 g) and desorptiontimes (3, 6, and 9 min).2.3.1 HS-SPME procedureAfter the selection of the best HS-SPME sampling condi-tions, the following procedures were carried out using0.75 g of apple sample in a 4 mL septum-sealed glass vialcontaining 1 mL of water and 0.10 g of NaCl. The systemwas placed in a thermostated bath adjusted to 508Cunder constant magnetic stirring (800 rpm). The DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber was then exposed to the headspace for30 min to promote the compounds transfer from thesample to the headspace. Following the sampling proce-dure, the SPME fiber was retracted prior removal fromthe sample container and immediately inserted into theGC system injection port at 2508C for 6 min, where theanalytes were thermally desorbed and transferreddirectly to the GC system column. Before daily analysis,the fiber was preconditioned for 15 min in the GC systeminjection port at 2508C. At least three replicates weredone for each sample. Considering that the polymerphase of fibers can absorb/adsorb aroma chemicals fromair and produce a high background in the chromato-gram, blank runs were conducted between extractions toverify the absence of any carry over which would causememory effects and result discrepancy [24, 25].2.4 GC-qMS analysisThe fiber containing the volatile compounds was intro-duced into the GC injector at 2508C and kept for 6 minfor thermal desorption. The desorbed volatile com-pounds extracted were separated and tentatively identi-fied using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph system(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled to anAgilent 5975 quadrupole inert mass selective detector. ABP-20 fused silica capillary column (30 m60.25 mmid60.25 lm film thickness) was used for the GC separa-tion. Splitless injection was employed using helium asthe carrier gas (Helium N60, Air liquide, Portugal) at aflow rate of about 1 mL/min (column head pressure13 psi). The initial oven temperature was 408C, followedby a linear programmed temperature from 40 to 2208Cat rate of 38C/min and held for 10 min at the end. The ioni 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA,Weinheim www.jss-journal.coma According to editor and reviewers suggestion1878 L. Ferreira et al. J. Sep. Sci. 2009, 32, 1875–1888source and transfer line temperatures were 2208C. Quad-rupole mass detector was operated at 1808C in the elec-tron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The electron multiplierwas set to the auto tune procedure. All data wereobtained by collecting the full-scan mass spectra withinthe range of 30–300m/z. For the determination of Kovat'sindex (KI), a C8–C20n-alkanes series was used.The volatile compounds were identified by matchingmass spectra with spectra of reference compounds in theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST05)Mass Spectral Search Program. In addition, the com-pounds were tentatively identified by comparing theexperimental retention indices with the theoretical onesobtained from literature. The relative amounts of theindividual components are expressed as percentage rela-tive to the total area (RPA, %).2.5 Statistical analysisPCA was used to examine the relationship among thecomposition and the wine variety. It is an unsupervisedtechnique that reduces the dimensionality of the origi-nal data matrix retaining the maximum amount of var-iance. LDA is a supervised technique method used forclassification purposes. Both methods were carried outusing the SPSS Program, version 11.0 (SPSS Headquar-ters, Chicago, IL, USA) and were applied to the normal-ized areas of the volatiles identified by HS-SPMEDVB/CAR/PDMS/GC-qMS.3 Results and discussion3.1 HS-SPME optimizationAccording to the proposed methodology, the volatilecompounds were extracted from apple samples using theHS-SPME technique that is very sensitive to experimentalconditions. Since it is an equilibrium technique, anymodification of an experimental parameter will changethe distribution coefficient and absorption rate, influ-encing the amount absorbed/adsorbed by the SPME fiberand its corresponding reproducibility [24]. Therefore, theexperimental parameters that influence the extractionefficiency such as fiber coating, extraction temperatureand time, sample amount, dilution factor (water vol-ume), ionic strength (NaCl amount), and desorption timewere systematically studied.3.1.1 SPME Fiber coatingThe extraction efficiency of volatile compounds by theHS-SPME technique strongly depends on their polarityand, consequently, on their affinity to the fiber-coatedphase [9, 29]. Therefore, six commercial types of fibers(70 lm CW/DVB, 50/30 lm DVB/CAR/PDMS, 75 lm CAR/PDMS, 85 lm PA, 65 lm PDMS/DVB, and 100 lm PDMS)were used to evaluate the effect of different coatings onthe extraction efficiency of volatile compounds in applesamples. The total ion current (TIC) chromatograms ofvolatile compounds identified in PP apple pulp extractsisolated by HS-SPME using different fiber coatings areshown in Fig. 1. The comparison among each TIC showsdifferent GC profiles. The results illustrated in Fig. 2 indi-cate that the DVB/CAR/PDMS and PDMS/DVB coatingshad higher extraction efficiency and a clear pattern ofvolatile compounds relatively to the other fibers. Despitethe PDMS/DVB fiber coating showed a similar extractionperformance comparatively to DVB/CAR/PDMS, the for-mer fiber coating showed a higher RSD% value than thelatter (Fig. 2). As reported in Table 1, the differences ofextraction efficiency of volatile compounds betweeneach fiber using the same extraction conditions arenoticeable. It can be observed that the fibers displayeddifferent selectivity to different groups of compounds,where ethyl esters accounted for the largest chemicalclass identified (Table 1). It is also clear that the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber showed a better qualitative and quantitativebehavior for apple volatiles than the remaining five stud-ied fibers with a total of 58 volatile compounds, whilePDMS/DVB fiber extracted 53 volatile compounds. Theremaining fibers PA, CAR/PDMS, CW/DVB, and PDMSextracted less volatile compounds, accounting with 44,43, 36, and 24 VOCs, respectively. Under the same condi-tions, the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber proved to be themost uni-versal and efficient for the isolation of PP apple pulp vol-atile compounds with different physic-chemical proper-ties, while the nonpolar PDMS fiber showed the lowestadsorptive capacity, but with a good selectivity for mid-dle to high-molecular weight analytes.3.1.2 Extraction temperature and timeExtraction temperature and time are significant param-eters in HS-SPME, since both have an effect on the equili-brium during extraction of volatile compounds [29]. Theextraction temperature has a significant influencebecause the distribution coefficient between the sampleand the headspace and between the headspace and thefiber is influenced by this specific parameter [28]. There-fore, different extraction temperatures (30, 40, and 508C)were studied using the two most efficient fibers (DVB/CAR/PDMS and PDMS/DVB) in order to determine thebest fiber coating for the extraction of VOCs from applesamples. The results summarized in Fig. 3 illustrate thatfor both fibers 508C presents an increased sensitivity,hence a better extraction efficiency and a lower SD. Con-sequently, the heating of apple samples improved therelease of analytes to the headspace and facilitated theHS-SPME process. Thus, with the temperature increase,the volatiles recovery was enhanced [24, 29]. Accordingthe results, 508C was chosen as the extraction tempera-ture in further experiments. As it can be observed fromi 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA,Weinheim www.jss-journal.comJ. Sep. Sci. 2009, 32, 1875–1888 Gas Chromatography 1879Fig. 3, the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber coating showed a betterextraction efficiency than PDMS/DVB. Based on theseresults this coating was chosen to perform the extractionof VOCs and SVOCs from M. domestica Borkh. apple spe-cies.The effect of extraction time was studied by increase inthe exposure time of the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber to theheadspace, from 15 to 75 min, maintaining the remain-ing experimental parameters strictly the same duringsampling. The influence of this parameter is displayed inFig. 3. As can be seen the best extraction efficiency ofVOCs from apple samples was obtained with 75 min. Itwas also observed a typical extraction profile that con-sists of an initial portioning followed by a “steady-state”equilibrium between the fiber and the vapor phase ofanalytes. For practical purposes, the extraction time of30 min was adopted because the volatile profile and thetotal number of obtained compounds are identical com-paratively to the volatile profile obtained with an extrac-tion time of 75 min.3.1.3 Sample amountThe sample amount was found to be volume dependent,even when 1.0 g of sample was placed inside the 4.0 mLvial instead of 0.75 or 0.5 g. However, larger sampleamounts do not mean better results [29]. As seen in Fig. 4,the best extraction efficiency was obtained with 0.5 g ofsample associated with a high SD, whereas 0.75 g of sam-ple also showed good extraction efficiency but with alower deviation. Finally, the lowest total peak area wasobtained using 1.0 g of sample and a high SD wasobserved. Considering the results, 0.75 g was selected asa sample amount to perform the volatiles extraction.3.1.4 Dilution factorAnother procedure that can be adopted in order toimprove the transfer of volatile compounds from thesolid phase to the gaseous-headspace phase is the addi-tion of water to the sample matrix. Therefore, thehomogenization of apple samples was performed ini 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA,Weinheim www.jss-journal.comFigure 1.

Thus, the homogen-ized samples represent more closely the volatile profilethan the entire or even cut apple. As observed in Fig. 4,the increase in water content in the sample matrixresulted in the decrease in extracted volatile compounds.Hence, in order to facilitate the sample agitation andconsequent volatile release to the headspace, the addi-tion of 1.0 mL of water was considered for further anal-ysis.3.1.5 Ionic strengthThe dissolution of salt (NaCl) into the sample matrixenhances the partition coefficient of analytes betweenthe headspace and the sample phase and therefore to thefiber [9, 24, 29]. To analyze the salt effect on the samplematrix, three different NaCl amounts (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g)were dissolved in order to saturate the sample matrix.Figure 4 shows the variation of the extracted amount ofvolatile compounds from the matrix with the amount ofsalt added. From these results, the amount of 0.1 g ofNaCl was added to all samples in the remaining assays.3.1.6 Desorption timeDesorption time was also investigated for 3, 6, and9 min.

The highernumber of extracted compounds and lower deviationwere also factors taken into consideration.3.2 Characterization of volatiles in apples (pulp,peel, and entire fruit)Characterization of VOCs and SVOCs compounds wasdone with the best HS-SPME methodology conditions oncommercialized fruits from different geographical ori-gins of Madeira Islands, bought in 2007. About 100 differ-ent compounds present in pulp, peel, and entire applesamples from PP, PS, and SS M. domestica Borkh. species(19 of which were common to PP, PS, and SS entire fruit,32 to peel and 27 to pulp (see Table 2)), were extracted fol-lowed by GC-qMS analysis and afterward, tentativelyidentified by matching to US NIST (resemblance percent-age above 80%), by matching calculated RI values to liter-ature values, or by injection of authentic standards.Kovts retention indices were calculated for each peakand compared with the literature in order to certify thecompound identification. Typical chromatograms (TIC)obtained from pulp, peel, and entire fruit of PP applesusing the HS-SPME/GC-qMS methodology with the opti-mized sampling conditions are shown in Fig. 5. Table 2lists the VOCs and SVOCs tentatively identified, in thethree apple varieties, comprising 39 esters, 20 alcohols,15 carbonyl compounds, 15 terpenoids, and 5 acids(Table 2). The peels of all three apple varieties presentedthe higher number of identified compounds, 64, 60, and64, in PP, PS, and SS, respectively, while the pulp pre-sented the lowest. The number and nature of VOCs andSVOCs varied according apple geographical origin andapple fraction (pulp, peel, and entire fruit). The relativeamount percent of the individual components areexpressed as percent peak areas relative to total peakareas (RPA%) and are listed in Table 2.Through a comparative analysis of results shown in Fig.6 and Table 2, it could be found that the chemical classesthat contribute to the total volatile profile of the studiedapple samples are terpenes, ethyl esters, and higher alco-hols. a-Farnesenewas on average themost abundant com-pound in all threeM. domestica Borkh. apple varieties stud-ied. Among ethyl esters which are responsible for a fruity,estery aroma, hexyl 2-methylbutanoate (10.80%), hexylacetate (4.02%), and ethyl hexanoate (3.52%) contribute toapple aroma characteristics as well as to aroma intensity[30]. Higher alcohols and carbonyls of six carbon atoms,namely hexan-1-ol, E-2-hexenal, and E-2-hexen-1-ol,responsible for the herbaceous odor of several fruits, werealso significantly abundant in all apple varieties ana-lyzed. The amount of these compounds was, on average,14.06, 3.35, and 2.76%, respectively.The RPA (%) values obtained for the different chemicalclasses in PP, PS, and SS pulp, peel, and entire fruit sam-ples are illustrated in Fig. 6. Higher alcohols, ethyl esters,carbonyl compounds, and acids represent 45.57, 38.28,12.59, 7.64, and 1.18%, respectively, of the total volatilefraction in pulp apples. As for peel, the significant contri-bution for the total volatile profile arises from terpenes(50.94%) followed by ethyl esters (23.71%), higher alco-hols (12.94%), carbonyl compounds (7.76%), and acids(1.18%). Finally, for entire fruit samples terpenes, higheralcohols, ethyl esters, carbonyl compounds, and acidsaccounts for 34.61, 23.27, 19.16, 10.85, and 3.10%, respec-tively, of the total GC peak area of the chromatograms.PP apple reports the higher content of VOCs and SVOCscompounds, having the most representative volatile pro-file in all matrices relatively to PS and SS samples. Thetotal amounts of PP apple compounds were 65.14 and5.79% higher than those of the PS and SS apples, respec-tively. Results reported in Table 2 demonstrate that themost prominent constituents found in PP apple pulpwere hexyl 2-methylbutyrate (49.05%), 3,4,5-trimethyl-4-heptanol (15.44%), ethyl hexanoate (5.81%), hexyl acetate(5.1%), and hexan-1-ol (4.57%). Relatively to PP apple peelthe VOCs and SVOCs with major contribution to theirvolatile profile are a-farnesene (45.39%), hexyl acetate(12.66%), ethyl hexanoate (6.14%), and E-2-hexen-1-ol ace-tate (4.88%). Concerning PP apple entire fruit these are a-farnesene (30.49%), 3,4,5-trimethyl-4-hexyl acetate(6.57%), heptanol (6.41%), and ethyl hexanoate (3.43%).As for PS apple, the major volatile compounds deter-i 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co.

Studies report that its presence on superficial celllayers of apples undergoes peroxidation through a, sofar, unknown mechanism, where the peroxidized prod-ucts somehow cause tissue damage and browning onthese fruits [31, 32].The distribution of VOCs and SVOCs between differentfractions (pulp, peels, and entire fruit) of PP, PS, and SSapples shows a highly uneven distribution (Fig. 7).Hexan-1-ol, ethyl butyrate and hexyl 2-methylbutyrate,e.g., were associated primarily with the pulp of the stud-ied apples, whereas a-farnesene, hexyl acetate, ethyl octa-noate and a-farnesene, hexanal, ethyl hexadecanoatewere found in higher content in peels and entire fruit,respectively. The total PS apples volatile fraction (66.66and 14.55%) occurred in the peel and pulp, whereas49.91 and 20.69% of the total PP volatile free fractionswere found in the peel and pulp, respectively. For SSapples, 47.11% of the total volatile fraction occurred inpeels while only 5.92% was determined in the pulp (Fig.7).3.3 Multivariate analysisBy the application of PCA to the normalized relativeamounts of all analytical variables (VOCs and SVOCs) andnine objects (apples), were extracted two factors thatexplain 81.5% of the total variance of initial dataset. Theobservation of the loading scores suggests that 13 varia-bles, having coefficients magnitude a0.8, can beremoved from the data matrix as they do not contributeto the explanation of data variability. The new variablesset (data matrix 8069) account for 89.9% of the total var-iance. The first principal component (PC)1 explains67.3% of the variance in the initial dataset and the sec-ond PC2 explain 22.6%. Table 3 present the eigenvalues,the percentage of variance and the cumulative percent-age explained by the two first PCs.The projections of the samples along the directionsidentified by the first two PC's, is reported in Fig. 8 wherethe first PC1 of apples are plotted against the second PC2.The separations among different varieties of apples fromthis PC1–PC2 scatter point plot are obvious (Fig. 8b).These figure shows that apples PS and SS were separatedby the second PC, while PP apples are most influenced bythe variables related with the first PC. The coefficientthat defines the weight of the original variable in the PCscan be investigated to understand which chemical com-pounds are responsible for the ranking of wines. Methylhexanoate (0.999), 3,4,5-trimethyl-4-heptanol (0.998), N.I.m/z (69, 101, 157) (0.998), ethyl hexanoate (0.998), andethyl octanoate (0.998) were highly loaded on the firstPC, while 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (0.972), ethyl 2-methylbutyrate (0.918), and butan-1-ol (0.887) wereloaded on the second PC explaining most of the variabil-ity (Fig. 8a). PP apples (first quadrant) are essentially char-acterized by ethyl hexanoate, ethyl heptanoate, styrene,ethyl benzoate, and E-2-hexenyl acetate. The SS apples(second quadrant) are strongly associated with hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, E,E-2,4-heptadienal, Z-b-farnesene, andbutan-1-ol, while the PS apples (third quadrant) are char-acterized by p-ethylstyrene, E-2-hexenal, estragole, butylhexanoate, and hexanal.After PCA, an LDA was applied in order to select anoperative classification role for discriminating the threesubspecies of apples obtained from different local inMadeira Island. Figure 9 reports a projection of apple spe-cies in 2D space, obtained by the two first discriminatefunctions that explain 100% of the total variance. Threegroups representing each apple species, PP, PS, and SSwere clearly observed. According to these results it cani 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA,Weinheim www.jss-journal.comFigure 7.

The optimization of SPMEparameters shows that the use of mixed phase DVB/CAR/PDMS coating fiber, demonstrated best performancecharacteristics for a wide range of analytes having differ-ent physic-chemical characteristics, when compared tothe other five tested fibers, particularly when the sam-ples were extracted at 508C for 30 min under constantmagnetic stirring. The applicability of the SPME tech-nique was evaluated using three apple varieties fromMadeira Islands. The optimized HS-SPME/GC-qMSmethod allows to identify in pulp, peel, and entire fruitof PP, PS, and SS apples ca. 100 VOCs and SVOCs fromdifferent chemical families, comprising esters, terpe-noids, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and fatty acids.The number and type of compounds varied according toapple variety and with the constituent parts of the apple.The peels presented the higher number of identifiedcompounds, 64, 60, and 64, for PP, PS, and SS appleswhile pulp apples presented the lowest, 46, 45, and 39,respectively. The families of compounds with a great con-tribution to the total chromatographic area were thehigher alcohols for the PP apples, esters for the PS applesand terpenoids for the PS apples. The obtained datasetswere submitted to PCA and the corresponding varietiesdiscriminations of PP, PS, and SS apples were successfullyestablished. The most important contributions to the dif-ferentiation of the three apple varieties were ethyl hexa-noate, hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, E,E-2,4-heptadienal, p-ethyl styrene, and E-2-hexenal. Prediction ability of thecalculated model was estimated to be 100% by the “leave-one-out” cross-validation.i 2009WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA,Weinheim www.jss-journal.comFigure 8.
