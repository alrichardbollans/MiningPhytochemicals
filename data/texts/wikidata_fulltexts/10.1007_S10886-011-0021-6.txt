Abstract Segregating plant hybrids often have more
ecological and molecular variability compared to parental
species, and are therefore useful for studying relationships
between different traits, and the adaptive significance of
trait variation. Hybrid systems have been used to study the
relationship between the expression of plant defense
compounds and herbivore susceptibility. We conducted a
western flower thrips (WFT) bioassay using a hybrid family
and investigated the relationship between WFT resistance
and pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) variation. The hybrid family
consisted of two parental (Jacobaea vulgaris and Jacobaea
aquatica) genotypes, two F1 genotypes, and 94 F2 hybrid
lines. The J. aquatica genotype was more susceptible to
thrips attack than the J. vulgaris genotype, the two F1
hybrids were as susceptible as J. aquatica, and susceptibil-
ity to WFT differed among F2 hybrid lines: 69 F2 lines were
equally susceptible compared to J. aquatica, 10 F2 lines
were more susceptible than J. aquatica and 15 F2 lines
were as resistant as J. vulgaris or were intermediate to the
two parental genotypes. Among 37 individual PAs that
were derived from four structural groups (senecionine-,
jacobine-, erucifoline- and otosenine-like PAs), the N-
oxides of jacobine, jaconine, and jacoline were negatively
correlated with feeding damage caused by WFT, and the
tertiary amines of jacobine, jaconine, jacoline, and other
PAs did not relate to feeding damage. Total PA concentra-
tion was negatively correlated with feeding damage.
Among the four PA groups, only the total concentration
of the jacobine-like PAs was negatively correlated with
feeding damage. Multiple regression tests suggested that
jacobine-like PAs play a greater role in WFT resistance than
PAs from other structural groups. We found no evidence for
synergistic effects of different PAs on WFT resistance. The
relationship between PA variation and WFT feeding
damage in the Jacobaea hybrids suggests a role for PAs
in resistance to generalist insects.

Introduction
In plants, research into the role of hybridization in the
evolution of novel traits and new species is gaining
momentum (Barton, 2001; Seehausen, 2004; Abbott et al.,
2008). Hybrids have been used increasingly in experimental
studies in ecology and evolution in part because interspe-
cific hybrids (specifically segregating generations) often
show greater variation in traits compared to parental
species. Furthermore, segregating hybrids frequently show
greater independence between different traits than the
parental species (Hochwender et al., 2000; Lexer et al.,
2003; Orians et al., 2010). Interspecific hybrids can have
novel patterns of secondary chemical expression or accu-
mulation compared to parental species, and sometimes can
be more resistant or susceptible to herbivores than parental
species (Rieseberg and Ellstrand, 1993; Fritz, 1999; Orians,
2000). This makes hybrids useful for studying the relation-
ship between secondary metabolite variation and herbivores
(Hallgren et al., 2003; Leiss et al., 2009).
Hybridization occurs frequently in the Jacobaea (syn.
Senecio, Asteraceae) genus (Vincent, 1996). Members of
this genus have been used extensively to study plant-
herbivore interactions, which are largely mediated by a
diverse group of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs; see reviews
by Hartmann, 1999; Macel, 2011). Twenty-six PAs have
been reported from 24 Jacobaea species (Pelser et al.,
2005). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are ester alkaloids composed
of a necine base (amino alcohol moiety) and an alkyl, or
rarely aralkyl, necic acid (Hartmann, 1999). PAs can occur
in two forms in vivo, the tertiary amine (free base) or the N-
oxide form (Hartmann et al., 1989; Rizk, 1991; Wiedenfeld
et al., 2008; Joosten et al., 2011). In Jacobaea species, all
PAs except for senecivernine are derived from senecionine
N-oxide, which is synthesized in the roots, transported to the
shoots, and diversified into other PA structures (Hartmann
and Toppel, 1987). Variation in PA structure and form can
lead to variation in the performance of generalist insects and
other plant enemies such as nematodes (van Dam et al.,
1995; Macel et al., 2005; Dominguez et al., 2008; Thoden et
al., 2009).
Jacobaea vulgaris (tansy ragwort or common ragwort,
syn. Senecio jacobaea) is native to Europe and west Asia
but invasive in North America, Australia and New Zealand.
Jacobaea aquatica (marsh ragwort, syn. Senecio aquaticus)
is closely related to, but not a sister species of, J. vulgaris
(Pelser et al., 2003). Natural hybrids between these species
occur in at least one location in The Netherlands (Kirk et
al., 2004). The two parental species are attacked by
different suites of specialist and generalist herbivores
(personal observation). A previous study showed that
artificial hybridization between these two species can be
used to produce F2 lines that are in some cases extremely
susceptible, and in other cases extremely resistant, to
generalist herbivores (Leiss et al., 2009).
Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (here-
after WFT), is a key insect pest on a wide range of
agricultural and horticultural crops globally (Kirk and
Terry, 2003). Since this species is highly polyphagous and
infests about 200 wild and cultivated host species (Yudin et
al., 1986), F. occidentalis often is used as a representative
generalist herbivore in studies of plant-insect interactions
(e.g., Macel et al., 2005; Leiss et al., 2009). Previous
studies have investigated the effects of PAs on WFT with
experiments that used artificial diets (Macel et al., 2005), or
demonstrated the relationship between PAs and WFT
resistance in host plants (Macel, 2003; Leiss et al., 2009).
These studies showed that PAs are toxic to WFT and play a
role in the plant resistance against this insect. However,
these authors incorporated only a limited number of PAs in
their studies. Some PAs were not easily acquired for
experiments. Only the major PAs were quantified in host
plants, and PAs were measured without discrimination
between the two forms due to technical limitations in
analytical methods. The effects of PA variation in host plant
on WFT resistance have not yet been tested.
The current study aimed to overcome the challenges
associated with isolating many PA variants for diet studies
by measuring WTF resistance in a segregating hybrid
family, which is expected to demonstrate great variation in
composition and concentration of secondary metabolites
such as PAs. Additionally, technological advances now
permit the detection of PAs that are present in extremely
low concentrations or that demonstrate only slight structural
variations compared to other PAs, thus allowing us to test
the relationship between WFT resistance and PA composi-
tion using a comprehensive set of PAs in vivo.
We carried out WFT bioassays with an artificial hybrid
family including one J. vulgaris genotype, one J. aquatica
genotype, two F1 offspring, and 94 different F2 hybrid
lines. We measured WFT feeding damage in the shoots of
these genotypes, and investigated the relationship between
PA variation and susceptibility to attack by WFT in the
segregating F2 generation. We addressed the following
questions: 1) Is there variation in WFT resistance among
segregating Jacobaea hybrids? 2) Is WFT resistance
explained by PA concentration and composition? and if
so, 3) Do different structural PA variants affect WFT
resistance differently? 4) Are there any interactions between
the effects of different PAs on WFT resistance?
Methods and Material
Study System and Plant Growth Jacobaea vulgaris seeds
(collected at Meijendel Nature Reserve, 52° 7' 54" N, 4° 19'
1072 J Chem Ecol (2011) 37:1071–1080
46" E, The Netherlands) and J. aquatica seeds (collected at
the Zwanenwater Reserve, 52° 48' 38" N, 4° 41' 7" E, The
Netherlands) were germinated in glass vials. Clones were
produced from tissue cultured seedlings, and several clones
were subsequently grown in pots in climate rooms under
standard conditions of 20°C, 70% relative humidity, light:
dark 16 h: 8 h (Cheng et al., 2011). Potted plants were
vernalized at 4°C with the standard light and humidity
conditions for approximately 10 weeks to facilitate flower-
ing. Both species are self-incompatible and crosses were
performed by rubbing flower heads together (Kirk et al.,
2005). Two rayed F1 offspring were selected from this
initial cross, and were reciprocally crossed with each other
to produce two sets of F2 offspring. One F2 set consisted of
56 individuals and the other consisted of 46 individuals.
The parental, F1 and F2 individuals were maintained in
tissue culture and were cloned to perform experiments
using replicate genotypes.
We grew about 6 cloned replicates per F2 genotype and
about 12 cloned replicates per parental and F1 genotype for
the WFT bioassay. In addition we grew the same number
of replicates of the genotypes for PA analysis. The PA
data for these genotypes were used both to study WFT
resistance as described in this paper and for an analysis
of patterns of PA profiles in Jacobaea hybrid plants that
was published elsewhere (Cheng et al., 2011). The clones
were individually potted in 1.3 l pots filled with 95%
sandy soil (collected from Meijendel), 5% potting soil
(Slingerland Potgrond company, Zoeterwoude, The
Netherlands) and 1.5 g/l Osmocote slow release fertilizer
(N:P:K=15:9:11, Scott®, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Marysville,
OH, USA). Plants were kept in a climate room under
standard conditions described above for 6 wk before the
bioassay was initiated.
WFT Bioassay We used 12 replicates of each parental and
F1 genotype, and 3–6 replicates of each of 94 F2 hybrid
genotypes (6 replicates were used for most genotypes,
though less than 6 were used in cases where plants died or
were too small compared to other plants of the same
genotype). A total of 587 plants were placed randomly in a
climate room and grown under standard conditions. About
5870 adult WFT, previously reared on chrysanthemum
(Dendranthema grandiflora), were released at evenly
spaced points in the climate room. During the 3 wk feeding
period, plants were watered every 2 d without wetting or
disturbing the leaves. After 3 wk, silver damage caused by
feeding from WFT on both upper and lower leaf surfaces
was visually scored in mm2 for each leaf, according to the
methods developed by Leiss et al. (2009). Above ground
plant parts (shoots) were harvested just above the root
crown and dried for 3 d in an oven at 50°C before
establishing the dry masses of the shoots.
PA Data Acquisition A Waters Acquity ultra performance
liquid chromatographic system coupled to a Waters Quattro
Premier XE tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
(Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used for PA analysis.
Analysis was performed using a different set of the same
tissue culture-derived clonal plants consisting of the same
genotypes and number of clones as those used in the WFT
bioassay, and grown under identical conditions. The plant
shoots were harvested, stored at −80°C, and freeze-dried for
1 wk under vacuum with a collector temperature of −55°C.
Dried plant material was ground to a fine powder and about
10 mg were extracted with 2% formic acid in a mass to
volume ratio of 1:100. Heliotrine (Latoxan, Valence,
France) was added as an internal standard to the extraction
solvent at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The extract was
filtered through a 0.2 μm nylon membrane filter (Acrodisc,
Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). An aliquot
(25 μl) of the filtered PA extract was diluted with water
(975 μl) and injected into the LC-MS/MS system.
Seventeen individual PA standards were available for
this study, representing the major PAs present in the plant
extracts (Table 1). Senecionine, seneciphylline, retrorsine,
and their corresponding N-oxides were obtained from
Phytolab, Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany; senkirkine was
obtained from Phytoplan, Heidelberg, Germany. Riddel-
liine and its N-oxide were obtained as authentic standards
from Dr M. Chou (NCTR, Jefferson, AR, USA), and
integerrimine was a gift of Dr. J. Trigo (UNICAMP,
Campinas, Brasil). Jacobine and erucifoline were isolated
from J. vulgaris plant material (PRISNA, Leiden, The
Netherlands). The identity of the isolated standards was
confirmed by 1H-NMR and LC-MS analysis and by
comparison with literature data (Logie et al., 1994).
Acetylseneciphylline was obtained by acetylation of
seneciphylline with acetic anhydride and pyridine, accord-
ing to the procedure described by He et al. (2010).
Integerrimine N-oxide, jacobine N-oxide, erucifoline N-
oxide, and acetylseneciphylline N-oxide were prepared by
N-oxidation of the corresponding tertiary amine PAs
according to the procedure described by Christie et al.
(1949) and adapted by Chou et al. (2003). The purity of the
obtained standards was checked by LC-MS analysis and was
at least 90%.
The other PAs listed in Table 1 were tentatively identified
on the basis of their retention time, molecular mass and
fragmentation pattern, and on comparison with PA standards
and literature data. The presence of PA N-oxides was
confirmed by selective reduction to the corresponding
tertiary amines according to the method of Joosten et al.
(2010). All PAs included in this study have been reported
before as constituents of J vulgaris and/or J aquatica
(Hartmann and Witte, 1995; Joosten et al., 2011; Langel et
al., 2011) and no new PAs were identified.

Data were recorded in multiple monitoring mode
(MRM) using two selected precursor ions to product ion
transitions per compound. The MS settings are shown in
Table 1. For quantification, the sum of the two peak areas
obtained for each compound was normalized against the
peak area of the internal standard. Quantification was
performed against a standard solution (100 μg/l) of the
PAs in an extraction of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), a plant
known to be free of PAs. The use of a PA standard solution
in blank plant extract was considered to be a more reliable
approach than quantification against a PA solution in
solvent only. This PA standard extraction was injected into
every 30 samples and the averaged response was used for
quantification. For those PAs without standards available, a
semi quantitative (indicative) value was obtained by
comparison with the most closely related analogue (e.g.,
an isomer) as indicated in Table 1. Data processing was
conducted with Masslynx 4.1 software (Waters, Milford,
MA, USA).
PA expression is genetically controlled under standard
growth conditions, and PA production is not induced in
shoots by aboveground herbivory in Jacobaea plants
(Vrieling and Bruin, 1987; van Dam et al., 1993; Vrieling
et al., 1993). Therefore, we averaged the concentration of
Table 1 Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) detected in Jacobaea aquatica, Jacobaea vulgaris and hybrids

each PA across all clones of each genotype and used the
genotypic mean concentrations in the analyses presented
here. The 37 PAs identified from the Jacobaea hybrids
could be classified into four types, according to their
structural characteristics, biosynthetic pathways, and ex-
pression pattern: senecionine-like PAs, jacobine-like PAs,
erucifoline-like Pas, and otonecine-like PAs (Pelser et al.,
2005; Cheng et al, 2011). We followed this classification in
this study (Tables 1–2). The total PA concentration as well
as the amount for each structural group was calculated by
summing the concentrations of the individual PAs.
Data Analysis We used general linear models to determine
whether WFT resistance differed according to plant
genotype. Feeding damage (dependent variable) was log-
transformed to achieve normality, and plant genotype was
defined as the independent variable with plant dry mass as
covariate. Normal distributions and homogenous variances
were confirmed by testing the residuals of the models using
Shapiro tests and Bartlett tests respectively. Two models
were set up: in the first, J. vulgaris was used as a reference,
and in the second, J. aquatica was used. All other
genotypes were compared to the reference in the model.

Differences between the hybrid and parental genotypes
were evaluated by using the regression coefficient matrices
of the two models. In each matrix, the estimated coefficient
of a hybrid indicated whether it had suffered more or less
damage than the reference genotype, and the P value
showed whether the difference was significant (Crawley,
2005). This is similar to a post-hoc test of an ANOVA
model, however, such a post-hoc test includes all pair-wise
comparisons between groups, and we were interested only
in testing for differences between hybrid and parental
genotypes. The difference between the two parental geno-
types was also tested by using the same regression coefficient
matrices. WFT resistance of each hybrid genotype was
categorized according to these definitions: ND—no differ-
ence, leaf damage area of the hybrid was not different from
that of both parents; A—additive, damage was intermediate
between that of the parents; Ds—susceptible-dominant,
damage was similar to that of the susceptible parent; Dr—
resistant-dominant, damage was similar to that of the resistant
parent, S—susceptible, damage was greater than that of the
susceptible parent; R—resistant, damage was less than that of
the resistant parent (Supplementary Table 1).
For correlation tests and principal components analysis, we
included only data from F2 genotypes, since we were
interested in using the variation from this segregating
generation to search for underlying relationships between
WTF resistance and PA expression. We were not able to test
for differences in these relationships between the different
generations described in this study because only a limited
number of genotypes were included from the parental and F1
generations. However, the parental and F1 plants provided
reference points for WFT resistance comparison. We used
log-transformed genotypic mean values of feeding damage
and PA concentrations to carry out correlation analyses.
Either Spearman (for six minor PAs that did not have
normally distributed concentrations) or Pearson correlation
tests were carried out to test the relationship between feeding
damage and the concentrations of individual PAs, pooled
concentrations of each of the four PA groups and total PA
(see details in Table 2 and Fig. 3).
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids from within structural groups
were closely correlated with each other, and it was not
possible, therefore, to investigate the interactions between
them. The PAs from different structural groups, however,
were generally expressed independently. The sum concen-
trations of the PAs from the four groups were not correlated
with one another (Cheng et al., 2011). We used a multiple-
regression model to test for interactions between the effects
of different PA structural classes on feeding damage. In this
model, feeding damage (represented by log-transformed
genotypic mean values) was defined as the dependent
variable, and the sum concentrations of each of the four
PA structural groups (log-transformed and centered geno-
typic mean concentrations) were defined as independent
variables.
The principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out
by using log-transformed genotypic mean concentrations of
all individual PAs except the six minor PAs that did not
have normally distributed concentrations. Compared to the
major PAs, these six PAs were present at very low
concentrations (on average less than 1% of total PA
concentration). Pearson correlation tests were carried out
between the first six principle components (PCs) from the
PCA and feeding damage. In order to evaluate the
contribution of each PA to each PC (in other words the
loading), Pearson correlation tests were carried out between
individual PAs and the first 3 PCs, since PCs four to six

accounted for a low proportion of the total variation and

P-values were adjusted using the sequential Bonferroni
method when multiple tests were carried out.
All analyses were conducted in R version 2.10.0
(R Development Core Team, 2009)
Results
Variation in Feeding Damage Feeding damage was
genotype-dependent (d.f.=97,488; F=5.30; P<0.001).
Plant mass also had effect on feeding damage (d.f.=1,488;
F=18.44; P<0.001). Among the two parental genotypes, J.
aquatica suffered more feeding damage than J. vulgaris
(d.f.=1, 22; t=6.18; P<0.001). Both of the F1 lines were as
susceptible as J. aquatica. Among the 94 F2 hybrids, 69
were as susceptible as J. aquatica, 10 were more susceptible
than J. aquatica, 15 showed intermediate resistance, 9 were
as resistant as J. vulgaris, and none were more resistant than
J. vulgaris (Fig. 1, see statistical details in Supplementary
Table 1).
Relationship Between Feeding Damage and PA Concen-
tration Correlation tests between feeding damage and
individual PAs showed that feeding damage was negatively
correlated with the concentrations of the N-oxides of two
jacobine-like PAs (jaconine and jacoline). Jacobine N-oxide
concentration was marginally correlated with feeding
damage, and the correlations between the free bases of
jacobine-like PAs and feeding damage were not significant
after correction for multiple testing. No other individual
PAs were correlated with feeding damage (Table 2). Total
PA concentration also was correlated with feeding damage
(Fig. 2a). Of the four structural groups of PAs, only the sum
concentration of jacobine-like PAs was significantly corre-
lated with feeding damage by WFT (Fig. 2c). The sum
concentrations of the other three groups were not correlated
with feeding damage (see the statistical results for
senecionine-and erucifoline-like PAs in Fig. 2b,d; for
otosenine-like PAs: d.f.=92, r=0.35, P=0.77).
The multiple regression models showed that among the
four PA groups only jacobine-like PAs had significant
negative effects on feeding. There were no two-way
interactions between the groups. A three-way interaction
between senecionine-like, jacobine-like and erucifoline-like
PAs and an interaction between the four PA groups were
present. However, these were only marginally significant
(0.05<P<0.1, Table 3).
Relationships Between Feeding Damage and PA Composi-
tion We used principal component analysis (PCA) to
reduce the PA data set to a smaller number of uncorrelated
axes. PC1 explained 44%, PC2 explained 19% and PC3
explained 12% of the variation in the data. More than 90%
of the total variation was accounted for by the first 6 PCs.
Among first 6 PCs, PC1 was negative correlated (d.f.=92,
r=−0.32, P=0.002) and PC3 was positively correlated with
feeding damage (d.f.=92, r=−0.23, P=0.04). No other PCs

were correlated with feeding damage (data not shown).
Correlation tests between each PC and individual PAs’
concentrations allowed us to identify which PAs were
associated with each PC. Jacobine-like PAs (except jaco-
zine and its N-oxide) were strongly correlated with PC1,
such that individuals with high PC1 scores had high
concentrations of jacobine-like PAs. Variation in some
senecionine-like, erucifoline-like PAs and otosenine-like
PAs contributed strongly to PC3 (individuals with high PC3
scores had low/high concentrations of these PAs; Supple-
mentary Table 2). A plot of PC1 vs. PC2 shows that F2
hybrids can be divided roughly into different groups.
Feeding damage, indicated by the size of the dots, is not
clearly clustered either on the plot of PC1 vs. PC2 or the
plot of PC1 vs. PC3 (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Segregating hybrids are sometimes used to study correla-
tions and trade-offs between different ecologically
important traits in plants, because they exhibit greater
variation than parental species, and greater indepen-
dence between traits (e.g., Orians et al., 2010). We
showed that there is high variation in the WFT suscepti-
bility among F2 hybrids of J. vulgaris and J. aquatica.
Although most F2 hybrids were as susceptible as or even
more susceptible than J. aquatica (73% and 11% among
all F2 hybrids respectively), there were still some hybrids
with resistance similar to J. vulgaris (10%) or intermedi-
ate to the two parents (6%). The expression of PAs among
the F2 hybrid generation was highly variable (Cheng et
al., 2011, but also see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), and this variation
provided an opportunity to investigate the in vivo effects
of PA composition on plant resistance to a generalist
herbivore.

alkaloid (PA) profiles of F2 hybrids of Jacobaea aquatica and

genotypic mean concentrations of all individual PAs excluding six
minor PAs that did not have normally distributed concentrations (see

each dot represents mean WFT feeding damage for that genotype. The
genotypic mean concentrations are the average value of the three to

We demonstrated that concentrations of total PA and
jacobine-like PAs were negatively correlated with feeding
damage by using correlation tests. Themultiple regression and
PCA also indicated that concentrations of jacobine-like PAs
were more closely related to WFT resistance than concen-
trations of the other PAs. The important role of jacobine-like
PAs in WFT resistance of Jacobaea plants also has been
supported by previous studies. Macel (2003) found that WFT
feeding damage was negatively correlated with total PA
concentration and with jacobine (both N-oxide and free base)
concentration in J. vulgaris plants. Leiss et al. (2009) found
that resistant Jacobaea hybrids had higher concentrations of
jacobine N-oxide and jaconine N-oxide than susceptible
hybrids. To develop a better understanding of the deterrent
effects of different PAs on WFT, bioassays should be
conducted using pure samples of different PAs.
Macel et al. (2005) tested WFT larval survival on
artificial diets containing six individual PAs including
senecionine, seneciphylline, retrorsine, senkirkine, helio-
trine, and monocrotaline, or mixtures of senecionine,
seneciphylline, and retrorsine. The experiment indicated
that toxic effects of PAs on WFT larva differed among the
individual PAs. Furthermore, higher PA concentrations had
more potent toxic effects, and no synergistic effects resulted
from PA mixtures. These findings support the results of our
study, with the caveat that our analysis revealed a potential
weak interaction between the different kinds of PAs. However,
the interactions were slight (0.05<P<0.1, Table 3), and it is
difficult to interpret interactions between more than two
predictors.
PA variation accounted for a relatively low proportion of
the variation in feeding damage (R2=0.17, Table 3).
Therefore, other factors likely play roles in plant suscepti-
bility to WFT. These factors may include plant physical
characteristics such as plant size, which was found to be a
significant covariate in this study. Total PA concentration
and plant size together explained a slightly higher propor-
tion of the total variation (R2=0.20). Other secondary
metabolites have been reported from these species and their
hybrids, including flavonoids, kaempferol glucoside, and
chlorogenic acid (Leiss et al., 2009; Kirk et al., 2011), and
other phytochemicals such as sesquiterpene lactones may
be present but remain unreported. These metabolites may
also play a role in resistance to herbivores, individually or
in interaction with PAs.
