Abstract
Background: Erythrina verna, popularly known as “mulungu”, is a Brazilian medicinal plant used to treat anxiety.
Erythrina alkaloids have been described in several species of Erythrina, which have biological and therapeutic
properties well known that include anxiolytic and sedative effects.
Methods: In this work, in vitro metabolism of erythraline (1), the major spirocyclic alkaloid of Erythrina verna, was
studied in the pig cecum model and by biomimetic phase I reactions. The biomimetic reactions were performed
with Jacobsen catalyst to produce oxidative metabolites and one metabolite was isolated and evaluated against
cancer cells, as HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (Glioblastoma) and OVCAR-8 (ovarian carcinoma).
Results: Erythraline exhibited no metabolization by the pig microbiota and a main putative metabolite was formed
in a biomimetic model using Jacobsen catalyst. This metabolite was isolated and identified as 8-oxo-erythraline (2).
Finally, erythraline and the putative metabolite were tested in MTT model and both compounds showed no
important cytotoxic activity against tumor cells.
Conclusions: The alkaloid erythraline was not metabolized by intestinal microbiota, but it was possible to identify
its oxidative metabolite from biomimetic reactions. So these data are interesting and stimulate other studies
involving this alkaloid, since it is present in phytomedicine products and there are not reported data about the
metabolism of erythrina alkaloids.

Background
The genus Erythrina (Fabaceae) comprises 115 species dis-
tributed in tropical and subtropical Forest [1]. “Erythros”
has Greek origin that means red and is related to the color
of the flowers [2]. Erythrina alkaloids are characteristic of
this genus with over one hundred structural derivatives de-
scribed to date [3–7]. E. verna is one of the 11 species that
occur in Brazil and it has being previously classified as
E. mulungu. In the folk medicine, these plants are used in
Brazil as a sedative, to treat sleep disorders and anxiety [8].
Systematic studies have supported the popular use by con-
firming the anxiolytic effects of a series of erythrina alka-
loids [9–11] and recently a mechanism of action was
proposed as a potent antagonist of α4β2 nicotinic receptors.
These observation also could be useful to provide a rational
basis for product standardization and for dosing recom-
mendations [12]. Take together, all these previous reports
stimulate the development of some phytomedicine prod-
ucts that appear now in the Brazilian market, but to date
there are no literature data regarding pharmacokinetics and
metabolism of active compounds. Considering these prob-
lems, investigations of cultivars that storage erythrina alka-
loids in high amounts are fundamental for a pre-clinical
trial and recently it was describe a commercial sample that
accumulates high levels of erythraline (Figure 1) [13]. In
addition, previous investigation described a weak cytotox-
icity for Erythrina alkaloids [14], which suggest also the
necessity to confirm the cytotoxicity effects of pure com-
pounds and justify the isolation for all assays.

The definition of possible metabolites in gut microbiota,
and phase 1 and 2 metabolism reactions are important
pre-clinical steps for medicines intended for oral delivery
[15–17]. The “pig cecum model” was developed and fur-
ther improved, showing good results for the metaboliza-
tion of flavonoids [18,19], but no reactions were observed
for lignans [20] suggesting, in this case, no metabolization
by the gut microbiota. These data are important for fur-
ther definitions of the compounds pharmacokinetics stud-
ies and to stimulate a continuous investigation of possible
phase 1 and 2 metabolization products. Several in vitro
biomimetic models were developed for phase I metabol-
ism investigations. Our group recently applied Jacobsen
catalyst ([Mn (salen)]) to produce similar metabolites
of CYP450 enzymes yielding the product in good scale
[21,22]. Comparative analysis confirmed the presence of
the same putative metabolite in biomimetic oxidative
model, microsomal fractions and in vivo experiments, re-
inforcing the importance of this methodology for pre-
clinical trials [20,23,24]. In this context, the aim of this
work was to investigate the metabolism of erythraline in
the pig cecum model and through biomimetic reactions,
in order to improve information on its pre-clinical phar-
macokinetic and also on the biological activity of the puta-
tive metabolite.
Methods
Plant material and extraction
E. verna were acquired commercially of a registered sup-
plier of plant matter. 5.4 kg of powered stem bark was
extracted by percolation with ethanol and after solvent
elimination afforded the ethanolic extract (488.72 g).
Isolation of erythraline
The ethanol extract (469.76 g) was solubilized in
CH2Cl2:MeOH (8:2) and extracted with 5% HCl (pH 2);
the resulting acid fraction was adjusted to pH 10 with
NH4OH and exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2. This
extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to
yield the alkaloid extract (4.51 g). This extract (4.34 g)
was fractionated by column chromatography on silica
gel and eluted with hexane:ethyl acetate gradient system
(8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 4:6, 1:9) to yield 155 fractions. The frac-
tions 9–25 (875.0 mg) were purified by HPLC to obtain
the alkaloid erythraline (367.5 mg), which was submitted
to Mn (salen) oxidation procedure.
Mn (salen) oxidation procedure
All the reactions were performed in a 10 mL glass vessel
equipped with a magnetic stirring bar at room temperature.
The reactions were performed in dichloromethane
using Mn (salen), erythraline (1) and oxidant (PhIO) in
the proportion 1:30:30 (μmol). After 24 hours (reaction
time), the samples were analyzed by GC-MS. Control
reactions were carried out in the absence of catalyst,
under the same conditions as the catalytic runs. No
products were detected.
Isolation of oxidative metabolites
The Mn (salen) oxidation reaction was submitted to
semipreparative LC using the following conditions: C18
column (Shim-pack Prep-ODS, 5 μm, 20 mm × 25 cm,
Shimadzu), flow rate 9 mL/min and acetonitrile (B) and
H2O (A) both with TFA 0.02% (v/v) as solvents. The elu-
tion profile was 0–25 min – 15-65% B, 25–30 min – 25-
80% B, 30–32 min – 80-100% B and 32–35 min – 100%
B. The compound 8-oxo-erythraline (2) was isolated
from this procedure and characterized by MS and NMR.

Evaluation of the metabolism by pig cecum model
Animals and cecum collection
Two animals (German Landrace or Angler Sattel x Pietrain,
10–12 months old, 120–150 kg weight) used to carry out
the pig cecum model experiments were bred without anti-
biotics on the diet, also called biodynamic conditions. To
ensure that the matrix (feces) were not exposed to the air
and kept under anaerobic conditions after the slaughtering
of the pig, the ceca were firstly ligated in both orifices and
stored in an anaerobic jar with Anaerocult A® (Merck) to
be transported to the laboratory. The ceca were obtained
from fresh slaughtered pigs, which are bred in a bio-
dynamic farm (Gut Wewel, Senden, Germany) and after-
wards delivered to the market (as food). Thus, it was not
mandatory to be approved by ethical committees, since the
ceca are a waste from the farm production.
Preparation of the inoculum suspension
All the steps of the inoculum preparation were done
under CO2 atmosphere inside a hermetic chamber. All the
vessels and solutions used were previously flushed with a
mixture of the gases N2 and CO2 (5:1, v/v). The cecum of
both animals were opened and the inside content was split
in 20 g (±1.0 g) portions in BD Falcon™ tubes (n = 6). Half
of these tubes (n = 3) were sterilized (121°C for 15 min at
1.1 bar using an AMB240 autoclave, Astell, Kent, U.K.) to
be used as a negative control (DA). The active inoculum
(not autoclaved) was denominated as CA for each animal
separated. To each of these tubes (n = 6) were added 20 mL
of 0.15 M PBS (pH 6.4) containing a trace element solution
0.0125% v/v (13.2 g CaCl2 × 2 H2O, 10.0 g MnCl2 × 4 H2O,
1.0 g CoCl2 × 6 H2O and 8.0 g FeCl3 × 6 H2O, all of them
dissolved in 100 mL of autoclaved deionized water) and a
Na2S-solution 11.1% (575.9 mg/100 mL of 0.037 M NaOH
solution). The suspensions obtained were afterwards fil-
tered through a net lace in order to avoid large particles at
the inoculum suspension. All the procedure were done in
duplicate for each single animal.
Sample incubation
In a 2 mL Eppendorf® tube, 100 μL of 1.0 mM ery-
thraline solution in MeOH was mixed with 900 μL of
the inoculum suspension. The samples were prepared
in duplicate for each time point (10, 20, 60, 120, 240
and 480 minutes) and incubated at 37°C. The same
procedure was applied to DA samples (negative con-
trol) and using 1.0 mM quercetin solution as positive
control incubated with active inoculum. On this study
two animals (cecum 1 and cecum 2, were divide in
two cecum 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 and 2.2, n = 4) were used in
order to consider the possible differences between the
animals microbiota.
Inoculum inactivation, sample preparation and
chromatographic analysis
Reached the respective incubation time the samples were
immediately stored at −80°C in order to stop the possible
reactions. Prior to the sample preparation the inoculum
was thawed in a water bath at 37°C and 1.0 mL of hydro-
chloric acid in methanol (1% v/v) was added. The samples
were sonicated for 15 minutes and afterwards centrifuged
at 20°C and 12000 × g for 10 minutes. The supernatant
was collected and used for chromatographic analysis. For
this analysis were used an High Performance Liquid Chro-
matograph (HPLC) equipped with Diode Array Detector
(DAD) Jasco XLC™, a reversed phase column Nucleodur
C18 ISIS, 5 μm, 150 × 2 mm (Macherey-Nagel) and water
(A):methanol (B) (both 0.1% formic acid) at the flow
0.4 mL min-1. The elution gradient applied was the follow-
ing: 0 – 2 min (10% B), 2 – 12 min (10→ 100% B), 12 –
14 min (100% B), 14 – 17 min (100→ 10% B) always
keeping an equilibration time between each injection of
three minutes. The wavelength used for the quantification
was 254 nm and the calibration curve showed r = 0.9957.
MTT assay
Compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect
against three cancer cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocytic
leukemia), SF-295 (Glioblastoma) and OVCAR-8 (ovar-
ian carcinoma) using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-
2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [25].
Cells were plated into 96-well plates (1 × 105 cells/mL
for adherent cells and 3 × 105 for leukemia cells) and
cultured for 24 h prior to addition of tested substances.
Compounds were screened by addition of concentrations
ranging from 0.016 to 5 μg/mL followed by incubation
for at 37°C for 72 h. Control groups received 0.1% of ve-
hicle used to diluted the tested substances (DMSO 0.1%).
Three hours before the end of the incubation, 150 μL of a
stock solution (0.5 mg/mL) of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich Co.,
Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. Absorb-
ance was measured using a DTX 880 Multimode multi-
plate reader (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA).
Results and discussion
Erythraline (Figure 1) was assayed in pig cecum model
and Mn (salen) oxidation procedure as reported before.
Under the chosen experimental conditions, no signifi-
cant degradation of erythraline was observed in the pig
cecum model when comparing activated and deactivated
ceca after 8 hours of incubation (Figure 2). Even though
there are some studies showing metabolism of aromatic
natural products in this model [18,19], the yield was very
low and apparently the bacteria from the pig intestinal
tract are not able to metabolize this alkaloid. The high
rate value observed in the metabolization for the positive
control using quercetin eliminates any possibility of

technical problems. Long-term experiments applying
24 hours of incubation also do not show any significant
metabolite formation (Figure 2). This result indicates
high intestinal stability of erythraline, which is one pre-
requisite for good absorption after oral administration.
The high similarity of the bacterial variety between the
ceca used can be assumed by the findings already showed
on the literature by Hein et al. [19], which used some spe-
cific rRNA-based probes in order to quantify the main bac-
terial groups contained in four ceca. Although the standard
deviations of these results are in some cases high, it is pos-
sible to note that there is a trend to have similar levels of
each bacterial group in all ceca.
Hein et al. [19] also compared their results with the
available values for humans, which proves the viability to
use the pig cecum model instead the human stool.
Another important hint is the origin of the animals used,
that were provided by the same biodynamic farm for this
study and for the study of Hein et al. [19].
As previously discussed in our recent studies, there is a
good correlation between putative in vitro and in vivo me-
tabolites formation. To investigate the possible erythraline
putative metabolites formation in biomimetic models, we
applied organometalic catalysis. The proportion between
erythraline, Mn (salen) and iodosylbenzene (PhIO) as ter-
minal oxygen donor was 1:30:30 (catalyst/substrate/oxi-
dant) as previously described for lapachol [22]. Excess of
PhIO showed a negative influence on the metabolite for-
mation, since most of the erythraline was consumed and
decomposed. Using the selected conditions, formation of a
major product with acceptable yields after 24 h was ob-
served. The reaction was scaled-up and submitted to isola-
tion process by HPLC allowing us to obtain product (2),
which was characterized by spectroscopic and spectromet-
ric procedures.
For compound 2, it was observed the ion m/z 312.1232
[M+H]+ as base peak in the mass spectrum obtained by
HRESI in positive ionization mode and its molecular for-
mula was determined to be C18H17NO4. The
1H NMR
spectrum showed signals at δH 5.83 and 5.86 (d, J = 1,0 Hz)
that characterized the methylenedioxy group (see the spec-
tra in Additional file 1). Further, the other signals indicated
a methoxyl group (δH 3.27) and five olefinic hydrogens,
which belongs to the aromatic ring [δH 6.65 (H-14)
and 6.64 (H-17)] and conjugated diene protons [δH
6.79 (H-1), 6.26 (H-2) and 6.01 (H-7)]. The carbonyl
presence at C-8 was confirmed mainly by downfield
shift of H-7 (+0.23 ppm) compared with the observed for
erythraline and the characteristic chemical shift of the
carbonyl (δC 171.6, conjugated amide). Eleven carbon
resonances were observed in DEPT 135° spectra, including
six methynes, four methylenes and a methoxyl group.
Therefore, the absence of one methylene carbon suggested
the oxidation in one of them, as well as the absence of two
aliphatic protons (H-8a, H-8b) in the 1H NMR when com-
pared with the spectrum of erythraline. Thus, the struc-
ture of 2 was determined as 8-oxo-erythraline (Figure 1),
which agrees with previously published studies [26].
The final step was to define if erythraline and the pu-
tative metabolite showed cytotoxic activity in MTT
model. For both compounds 1 and 2, a weak cytotox-
icity was observed in the hepatocyte carcinoma Hep-G2
and cervix carcinoma HEP-2 cell lines with IC50 values
of 17.6 and 15.9 μg/mL for erythraline (1), respectively,
and 3.9 and 18.5 μg/mL for 8-oxo-erythraline (2). In the
present study, the highest evaluated concentration was
5 μg/mL using a colon adenocarcinoma cell HCT-116, a
metastatic melanoma cell MALME-3 M and a meta-
static prostate cell PC-3 M, and no significant change
on cell viability was observed for both compounds re-
gardless of the cell type used. These data reinforce that
those alkaloids could not be considered highly toxic to
cancer cell lines, as previously observed for other alka-
loids [14,27].

Conclusions
The results indicated that the alkaloid erythraline is not
metabolized by the pig cecum microbiota and one putative
metabolite was formed in a biomimetic model using
Jacobsen catalyst, which was isolated and identified as 8-
oxo-erythraline. Erythraline and its metabolite showed
no cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Our findings
are extremely relevant, since erythrina alkaloids are
present from phytomedicines used in the therapeutic
and there is no information on their metabolism and
they could be used for pre-clinical trials.
