ABSTRACT: The boiled juice of Stachytarpheta cayennensis, Verbenaceae, whole plant material 
is used ethnomedicinally in different countries of Latin-America to treat symptoms of malaria. 
In the ethyl acetate extract, fi ve phenylethanoid glycosides could be identifi ed. Three of these 
phenylethanoid glycosides, leucosceptoside A, martynoside and jionoside D were detected for 
the fi rst time in the genus Stachytarpheta.

INTRODUCTION
Stachytarpheta cayennensis (Rich.) Vahl (syn.: 
Stachytarpheta guatemalensis Moldenke), Verbenaceae, 
is an herb or small shrub commonly found in forest, 
thickets, and swamps and on savannas from Mexico 
to Panama. The plant is known as “camaq olal”, “San 
Diego”, “verbena”, and “vervena”. The boiled juice is 
used by natives as a remedy for malaria and dysentery 
(Moldenke, 1973). In Guatemala, a decoction of the 
leaves is drunk to relieve specifi c symptoms or conditions 
that often accompany malaria, such as weakness and 
fever (Comersford, 1996). In Brazil, an infusion of the 
entire plant is used to treat malaria (Milliken, 1997) and 
against respiratory diseases, it is drunkas tea until the 
symptoms disappear (Agra et al., 2008). In Nicaragua, 
a decoction of the dried leaf material is indicated to 
cure fever (Coe and Anderson, 1996). Additionally, the 
plant is used as an analgesic, anti-infl ammatory and 
diuretic (Alice et al., 1991), as well as a remedy for liver 
disorders (Milliken, 1997).
S. cayennensis belongs to a widely distributed 
and complex family of about 76 genera and 3435 specifi c 
and subspecifi c taxa, found all over the world except the 
driest and hottest parts of the Sahara Desert and in the 
Arctic and Antarctic regions. The family Verbenaceae 
is closely related to the Lamiaceae from which it is 
distinguished with diffi culty (Moldenke, 1973).
A previous study determined the antiplasmodial 
activity of hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts from S. 
cayennensis against the chloroquine-sensitive strain 
poW and the multiresistant clone Dd2 of Plasmodium 
falciparum. The petrol ether/ ethyl acetate extract showed 
only low activity at 50 μg/ml (Jenett-Siems et al., 1999). 
In addition, the hydroalcoholic extract of S. cayennensis 
inhibits the growing of Leishmania promastigotes forms 
in vitro accounting for the folk use of this vegetal in skin 
ulcers caused by Leishmania (Moreira et al., 2007).
In this study, the species was investigated 
phytochemically which led to the isolation of fi ve 
phenylethanoid glycosides.

TMS as internal standard. Samples were dissolved in 
methanol-d4. 
FAB-MS were obtained on a Varian MAT 
CH5DF instrument with DMSO/Glycerin, Xenon; 
CHCl3/slm-Nitrobenzylalkohol, Xenon or MeOH/
Glycerin, Xenon as solvents. 
Plant material
S. cayennensis was collected in an area around 
Panama City by PD Dr. Jenett-Siems. It was identifi ed by 
Prof. Dr. M. D. Correa A., Panama. A voucher specimen 
CIFLORAN 2756 was deposited in the herbarium of the 
University of Panama. 
Extraction and isolation of compounds
Air dried whole plant material (430 g) was 
extracted with methanol (3x2.0 L). The extract was 
concentrated under reduced pressure yielding 42 g of 
the crude methanol extract (CME). The dry CME was 
acidifi ed with a 2 % (m/v) aqueous solution of tartaric 
acid. The aqueous layer was extracted with petrol ether 
(3x0.40 L), CH2Cl2 (3x0.40 L) and EtOAc (3x0.40 
L). Of the evaporated EtOAc-extract (3.16 g), 0.5 g 
was dissolved in 1.5 mL methanol. Purifi cation by 
preparative TLC (HCO2H-H2O-EtOAc 9:9:82) yielded 
iso-acteoside (1) (Rf 0.56, 4.6 mg) and acteoside (2) (Rf 
0.63, 5.2 mg).
The remaining EtOAc-extract (2.6 g) was 
subjected to column chromatography on LiChroprep® 
RP-18 material [Merck, 40-63 μm, 28.5 g] and 
fractionated into 14 fractions (H2O-MeOH 80:20 to 
MeOH). Fraction C2 (H2O-MeOH 60:40) allowed the 
isolation of compounds leucosceptoside A (3) (Rf 0.57, 
5.9 mg), and a mixture of martynoside (4) and jionoside 
D (5) (Rf 0.61, 27.2 mg) by preparative TLC (HCO2H-
H2O-EtOAc 9:9:82).

using a combination of column chromatography and 
preparative TLC which resulted in the isolation of 
fi ve phenylethanoid glycosides (Figure 1 and 2). Upon

preparative TLC acteoside (2) and its isomer iso-
acteoside (1) were obtained as amorphous compounds. 
The negative FAB-MS of acteoside (2) showed 
a pseudomolecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 623. The 1H NMR 
spectrum of (2) consisted of a set of signals at δ 6.67 ppm 
(1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5), 6.69 ppm (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, 
H-2), and 6.56 ppm (1H, dd, J = 2.0 Hz, J = 8.0 Hz, H-6) 
and another set at δ 6.77 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5’’’), 
6.95 ppm (1H, dd, J = 2.0 Hz, J = 8.0 Hz, H-6’’’) and 7.05 
ppm (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2’’’). These resonances are 
characteristic for the presence of two 1,3,4-trisubstituted 
aromatic systems. One of these aromatic systems is part 
of a caffeoyl-moiety due to the signals for two olefi nic 
protons at δ 6.27 ppm (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-8’’’) and 
δ 7.59 ppm (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-7’’’), indicating a 
trans geometry. Proton signals at δ 2.79 ppm (2H, d, 
J = 8.0 Hz, H-7), 3.72 ppm (1H, m, H-8a) and δ 4.05 
ppm (1H, m, H-8b) revealed that the second aromatic 
system is part of a phenylethanoid moiety. The 1H NMR 
spectrum also displayed a number of signals between 
3.00 and 4.00 ppm, suggesting the existence of sugar in 
the molecule. Accordingly, the signal at δ 1.09 ppm (3H, 
d, J = 6.1 Hz, H-6’’) was ascribed to the methyl group 
of a rhamnose moiety and furthermore a signal at δ 5.18 
ppm (1H, d, J = 1.5 Hz, H-1’’) with a small coupling 
constant could be assigned to the anomeric proton of 
an α-L-rhamnose. A second anomeric proton at δ 4.37 
ppm (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-1’) with a coupling constant 
of 8.0 Hz, pointed to a β-hexopyranose. Comparing the 
1H-NMR data with previously published data (Sasaki et 
al. 1978; Miyase et al., 1982; Andary et al., 1989) led to 
the identifi cation of acteoside (2). In 1978 acteoside was 
isolated for the fi rst time out of fresh leaves and stems 
of Martynia louisiana Mill., Pedaliaceae (Sasaki et al., 
1978). Additionally, acteoside was afforded from fresh 
roots of Leucosceptrum japonicum (Miq.) Kitamura & 
Murata, Lamiaceae (Miyase et al., 1982), from roots of 
Plantago crassifolia Forssk., Plantaginaceae (Andary et 
al., 1989), and from numerous other plant species. 
The negative FAB-MS of iso-acteoside (1) 
showed a pseudomolecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 623. In the 
1H-NMR spectrum of (1), characteristic signals arising 
from six aromatic protons at δ 6.62 ppm (1H, d, J = 
8.0 Hz, H-5), 6.66 ppm (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2) and 
6.53 ppm (1H, dd, J = 2.0 Hz, J = 8.0 Hz, H-6), as well 
as at 6.76 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5’’’), 6.89 ppm 
(1H, dd, J = 2.0 Hz, J = 8.0 Hz, H-6’’’) and 7.02 ppm 
(1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2’’’) showed the presence of two 
1,3,4-trisubstituted benzenes. One of these aromatic 
systems is part of a caffeoyl-moiety due to the signals 
for two olefi nic protons at δ 6.28 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 
Hz, H-8’’’) and δ 7.55 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz, H-7’’’), 
representing a trans-geometry. Proton signals at δ 2.77 
ppm (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, H-7), 3.70 ppm (1H, m, H-8a) 
and δ 3.97 ppm (1H, m, H-8b) could be assigned to a 
phenylethanoid moiety. Furthermore, two doublet signals 
that appeared at δ 4.32 ppm (J = 8.0 Hz) and δ 5.17 ppm 
(J = 1.5 Hz) were attributed to the anomeric protons of 
a β-glucose and an α-rhamnose unit, respectively. The 
downfi eld shift of H-6’a+b compared to (2) led to the 
identifi cation of (1) as iso-acteoside (Miyase et al., 
1982). In earlier studies iso-acteoside was isolated e.g. 
out of fresh roots of Leucosceptrum japonicum (Miq.) 
Kitamura & Murata, Lamiaceae (Miyase et al., 1982). 
Leucosceptoside A (3) differs structurally from 
acteoside (2) by the replacement of caffeic acid with 
ferulic acid. The 1H-NMR spectrum of (3) was similar 
to that of acteoside (2) and iso-acteoside (1) due to the 
characteristic signals arising from six aromatic protons 
at δ 6.67 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.9 Hz, H-5), δ 6.56 ppm 
(1H, dd, J = 1.9 Hz, J = 8.1 Hz, H-6) and δ 6.69 ppm 
(1H, d, J = 1.9 Hz, H-2) as well as signals at δ 6.81 
ppm (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz, H-5’’’), δ 7.08 ppm (1H, dd, 
J = 1.7 Hz, J = 8.2 Hz, H-6’’’) and δ 7.19 ppm (1H, 
d, J = 1.7 Hz, H-2’’’) showing the presence of two 
1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems. One of these 
benzenes is part of a feruloyl-moiety due to the signals 
for two olefi nic protons at δ 6.37 ppm (1H, d, J = 15.8 
Hz, H-8’’’) and δ 7.66 ppm (1H, d, J = 15.8 Hz, H-7’’’), 
which indicate the trans-geometry and the characteristic 
signal at δ 3.88 ppm (3H, s, OCH3) for the methoxy-
group. Proton signals at δ 2.79 ppm (2H, t, J = 6.2 Hz, 
H-7), 3.79 ppm (1H, m, H-8a) and δ 4.05 ppm (1H, m, 
H-8b) revealed that the second aromatic system is part 
of a phenylethanoid moiety. The sugar resonances were 
again similar to that of (2), allowing the identifi cation of 
(3) as leucosceptoside A (Miyase et al., 1982; Sasaki et 
al., 1989). In previous investigations, leucosceptoside A 
was isolated together with iso-acteoside and acteoside 
out of the under terrestrial parts of Leucosceptrum 
japonicum (Miq.) Kitamura & Murata, Lamiaceae 
(Miyase et al., 1982) and as well out of dried roots of 
Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. var. purpurea Makino, 
Scrophulariaceae (Sasaki et al., 1989).
Martynoside (4) and jionoside D (5) were 
isolated as a 3:1 mixture. Both compounds have 
similar features but differ structurally in the number of 
methoxy groups. This is refl ected in the positive FAB-
MS showing pseudomolecular peaks [M+Na]+ at m/z 
675 (4), respectively [M+Na]+ at m/z 661 (5). The 1H 
NMR spectrum of martynoside (4) showed a signal for 
a methoxy group at δ 3.89 ppm (3H, s, OCH3-3’’’) in the 
acid moiety and furthermore a signal at δ 3.81 ppm (3H, 
s, OCH3-4) in the phenylethanoid portion (Sasaki et al. 
1978; Miyase et al. 1982; Calis et al. 1984; Teborg and 
Junior 1989) (Figure 2), whereas jionoside D possesses 
only one methoxy group at δ 3.81 ppm (3H, s, OCH3-4) 
(Sasaki et al. 1989). Martynoside (4) was isolated from 
Miyase and co-workers in 1982 from Leucosceptrum 
japonicum (Miq.) Kitamura & Murata, Lamiaceae 
(Miyase et al., 1982) and furthermore together with 
jionoside D (5) out of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. 
var. purpurea Makino, Scrophulariaceae (Sasaki et al., 
1989).

Phenylethanoid glycosides are characteristic 
constituents of families belonging to the order 
Lamiales, as e.g. Lamiaceae and also the closely related 
Verbenaceae. Two of the isolated compounds, namely 
acteoside (2) and iso-acteoside (1) were already found 
in Stachytarpheta cayennensis before (Schapoval et al., 
1998; Adebajo et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2008), and 
acteoside also in Stachytarpheta glabra (Viccini et al., 
2008), whereas the other phenylethanoid glycosides 
leucosceptoside A (3), martynoside (4) and jionoside 
D (5) were detected for the fi rst time in the genus 
Stachytarpheta.
