O fracionamento cromatográfico do extrato hexânico dos galhos de Luxemburgia nobilis
(Ochnaceae) forneceu β-sitosterol, estigmasterol, ácido betulínico, os ácidos graxos hexadecanóico,
tetraeicosanóico, hexaeicosanóico e linoleico, 14-metilpentadecanoato de metila, óxido de 13-
epimanoíla, o depsídeo atranorina (1), e dois triglicerídeos novos (2 e 3). As estruturas das substâncias
isoladas foram determinadas através da análise dos dados espectroscópicos de I.V., massas e RMN
de 1H e de 13C incluindo comparação com dados da literatura. A análise do espectro de massas
(FAB-MS) dos éteres tiometílicos (4 e 5) foi usada para definir as estruturas dos triglicerídeos.
Chromatographic fractionation of the hexane extract from the branches of Luxemburgia nobilis
(Ochnaceae) afforded β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, betulinic acid, linoleic acid, methyl-14-
methylpentadecanoate, 13-epimanoyl oxide, hexadecanoic acid, tetraeicosanoic acid, hexaeicosanoic
acid, the depside atranorin (1) and two new triglycerides (2 and 3). The structures were defined by
IR, MS and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral analysis involving comparison with literature data. The
FAB-MS spectra analysis of the thiomethyl ethers (4 and 5) were used to define the structures of the
triglycerides.

Introduction
In the course of our Brazilian plants phytochemical and
pharmacological investigations we decided to study spe-
cies of the Ochnaceae. This family contains species that
have been used as medicinal plants1,2. We have previously
reported the presence of triterpenes, a biflavone, biisofla-
vanones and an isoflavone in Ouratea hexasperma3,4. In
recent publications we described the occurence of bifla-
vones, flavonoid glycosides, chloroisoflavonoids,
norisoprenoids, diterpenes, lignans, triterpenes and steroids
in O. semisserata5-7. In these studies we have also detected
the growth inhibition of murine tumour and antiproliferative
effects, as well as activation of apoptosis on Ehrlich tu-
mour cells, by biflavones isolated from these species8.
In this first phytochemical analysis of Luxemburgia ge-
nus (Ochnaceae) we report the presence of the known com-
pounds β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, betulinic acid, linoleic
acid, methyl-14-methylpentadecanoate, 13-epimanoyl ox-
ide, and the depside atranorin (1), together with three ali-
phatic acids (hexadecanoic, tetraeicosanoic, hexaeicosanoic
acids) and the two new triglycerides dihexadecanoyl-cis,cis-
8,11-eicosadienoyl glycerol (2) and dihexadecanoyl-
cis,cis-6,9-octadecadienoyl glycerol (3).
Results and Discussion
The known natural compounds and the aliphatic acids
were identified mainly by their 1H and 13C NMR and mass
spectrometry analysis, including comparison with litera-
ture data (see experimental).
The depside atranorin (1) was identified by analysis of
1H and 13C NMR (HBBD and DEPT) including homo-
nuclear (1H-1H-COSY, 1H-1H-NOESY) and heteronuclear
[1H-13C-HMQC-1JCH, 1H-13C-HMBC-nJCH (n = 2 and 3)]
2D NMR experiments, mass spectra and comparison with
the 1H NMR data of literature9. These data enabled us to
assign unambigously the 13C NMR chemical shifts of
atranorin unreported in the literature. This depside has pre-
viously been isolated from lichens9-11 and it probably was
found in the branches of  L. nobilis because of a lichen
symbiont growing on them.
Glycerides 2 and 3 were isolated together as a viscous
oil which showed IR absorptions at 2919, 2848 and 726
cm-1 (alkyl chain), 1655 cm-1 (double bond) and 1737 cm-
1
 (ester carbonyl). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (1D and
2D experiments) exhibited signals for olefinic hydrogen at
δ 5.33 (m) connected to carbons at δ 129.9 and 127.9. These
signals, together with the absence of absorption around

970 cm-1 in the IR spectrum, indicate a cis geometry of the
olefinic bonds. The coupling exhibited in the COSY spec-
trum between a hydrogen at δ 2.03 (dd, 14.0 and 6.0 Hz)
and δ 2.78 (m) and the olefinic hydrogen indicates that the
CH2 is connected to a double bond carbon. The connec-
tion of CH2 at δH 2.03 with δC 27.2 and at δH 2,78 with δC
25.5 (1JCH) and 129.9 and 127.9 (2,3JCH) revealed in the
HMQC and HMBC spectra, respectively, led us to propose
the methylene interrupted diene for the unsaturated fatty
esters (2 and 3). The comparison of the NMR data with
those of methyl linoleate12 was used to confirm the nature
of this unit in the glycerides. The other signals at δH 5.25
(m), 4.25 (dd,12.0, 5.0Hz), 4.15 (dd, 12.0, 6.0Hz), 2.3 (t,
8.0Hz), 1.68 (m), 1.25 (m), 0.87 (t, 8.0Hz) belong to hydro-
gens which connected, respectively, with carbons at δC
68.9 (CH), 62.1 (CH2), 62.1 (CH2), 34.2 (CH2), 24.8 (CH2),
31.9-29.0 (CH2) and 14.1 (CH3) are in agreement with a
triglyceryl ester. The FAB-mass spectra of the natural sub-
stances showed peaks at m/z 603 (2a), 575 (3a), 551 (from 2
and 3), 337 (2b), 313 (2c e 3c), 309 (3b) and 239 (from 2 and
3) which are in agreement with trigliceryl esters (Scheme 1).
The possibility of an octadecanoic unit was also ruled out
by the absence of a peak at m/z 267 in the mass spectrum. To
locate the double-bond in the fatty acyl chain we used a
procedure involving addition of dimethyl disulfide to the
double bond followed by mass spectrometry analysis13,14.
The thiomethyl derivatives (4 and 5) showed an intense
peak at m/z 173 (32%, indicated in the structures 4 and 5)
together with other peaks at the low mass end of the spec-
trum (111, 97, 83, 69, 55 and 41u) which represent frag-
ments of the terminal alkene, presumably due to the loss
of 62 (H3C-S-CH3) from m/z 17313. The analysis of mass
spectra to justify the other peaks allowed proposition of
the fragments indicated for 4 and 5 (m/z 551, 497, 469,
239) and the structures 4a-4h for 4 and 5a-5h for 5 (Scheme
2) which are in agreement with the double bonds at
δ 8,11 (2) and 6,9 (3) in the olefinic acids. The same
pattern of fragmentation was observed in the mass spectrum
of the thiomethyl derivative of linoleic acid. These data
and the [α]20 D: +0.8 (c 2.5, CDCl3) were used to propose
the structure of the new triglyceryl esters as dihexadecanoyl-
cis,cis-8,11-eicosadienoyl glycerol (2) and dihexadecanoyl-
cis,cis-6,9-octadecadienoyl glycerol (3).
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points (m.p.) are uncorrected. Optical rotation
was measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341. The 1H and 13C
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 spec-
trometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. 1H-1H- COSY,
234 Carvalho et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc
1H-13C-COSY (HMQC and HMBC) NMR experiments were
performed on the same spectrometer, using standard Varian
pulse sequences; HMBC and HMQC experiments were opti-
mized for nJCH = 9 Hz and 1JCH = 140 Hz. Mass spectra were
determined with a VG Quattro instrument. The GC-MS analyses
were determined with a VG Quatro-GC-8000, with triple qua-
drupole using gas flow 15mL min-1 (12 psi He), source temp.
200oC, pressure 1.10-4 mbar, colum HP5 (30m x 0,32 mm),
temp. var. 150-300 (10o min-1), and CH2Cl2 was used as
solvent. FT-IR spectra were recorded as a film on a Perkin-
Elmer 1500 spectrometer. Chromatography was performed
using silica gel (Merck) for column and preparative TLC.
The purity of the compounds was checked by 1H and 13C
NMR spectral analysis and TLC plate, revealed with UV
(254 nm) and vanillin (0.5 g) in H2SO4 + EtOH (40 : 10).
Plant material
Luxemburgia nobilis samples were collected in Morro
de São Sebastião, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil by Jorge
L. Silva who performed the identification by comparing it
with a herbarium specimen (# 6737) kept at the Herbarium
José Badini of the Instituto de Ciências Exatas e Biológicas,
Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto-M.G., Brazil.
Extraction and isolation of the constituents
Dried plant material (branches, 184 g) was powdered
and extracted with hexane by maceration at room tem-
perature and the solvent was removed under vacuum to
yield 3.85 g of residue. This residue was fractionated by sol-
vent partition between hexane and methanol/H2O (9 : 1).
The residue of the hexane part (3.58 g) was subjected to col-
umn chromatography on silica gel using hexane/CHCl3
(1 : 1) increasing the polarity to methanol (100%), collecting
20 mL fractions. Fractions 6-7 (15 mg) were analyzed by
GC-MS and by comparison with a mass spectra library.
This allowed the identification of methyl 14-methylpen-
tadecanoate, linoleic acid and manoyl oxide (56.6%,
10.7%, 32.7%, respectively). The presence of these

compounds was confirmed by analysis of 1H and 13C NMR
spectral data and comparison with those in the litera-
ture12,15,16. Fractions 10-11 (173 mg, m.p. 68oC) gave
hexadecanoic acid, identified by analysis of its 1H and
13C NMR spectra and by observation of its molecular ion
at m/z 256 (CI and FAB–MS). Fractions 12-15 afforded a
mixture that was further purified by crystallization from
hexane/EtOAc (1 : 1) to yield a mixture of triglycerides (2
+ 3, oil, 20 mg) and pure atranorin (1, 11 mg, m.p. 192
oC)10,11. Fractions 17-19 (100 mg, m.p. 72 oC) yielded a
mixture of tetraeicosanoic acid and hexaeicosanoic acid that
were identified by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry (FAB
and CI-MS) analysis. Fractions 36-51 (91 mg, m.p.
115 oC) were found to contain two components, sitosterol
and stigmasterol12,15. Fractions 54-60 were further puri-
fied by column chromatography using silica gel and elu-
tion with CH2Cl2/MeOH (9:1). Fractions 11-14 of this sec-
ond purification gave betulinic acid (30 mg, m.p. 295 oC),
identified by comparison of 1H and 13C NMR data with those
in the literature12,17,18. The residue of the methanol fraction
(288 mg) from the original solvent partition was subjected to
column chromatography using silica gel and CH2Cl2 - metha-
nol (9 : 1). Fractions 5-8 (50 mg) were purified by preparative
TLC to give betulinic acid and other compounds which could
not be identified due to the limited amount of material.

Preparation of thiomethyl ethers (4 + 5).
Dimethyl disulfide (2.0 mL) and the triglyceride (5.0
mg) were placed in a vial with a septum equipped with a
magnetic stirrer and 0.5 mL of a clear solution of I2 in
MeSSMe (3 mL) was added to the mixture. The flask was
purged with argon using two needles. After stirring for 24
h at room temperature, the reaction was completed. The
product was subjected directly to EI-MS and FAB-MS
analysis (Scheme 2).
