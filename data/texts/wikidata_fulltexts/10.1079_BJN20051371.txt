Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intes-
tinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but
now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in
foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan
precursors. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-
three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301 129mg/100 g), which con-
tained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29 331mg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For
grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764mg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had
similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans
(185–2321mg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91mg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109
foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.
Lignans: Phytoestrogens: Food composition: Secoisolariciresinol: Matairesinol: Pinoresinol: Lariciresinol
Lignans are diphenolic compounds that are widely distributed in
the plant kingdom. A large variety of plant lignans exist, but
only a few of them are converted into the ‘enterolignans’ entero-
diol and enterolactone by the intestinal microflora. Enterolignans
are absorbed into the human body.
Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were
seen as enterolignan precursors, but new precursors have recently
been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high
degree of conversion (Heinonen et al. 2001). Lignans possess sev-
eral biological activities, such as antioxidant and (anti)oestrogenic
properties, and may thus reduce the risk of certain cancers as well
as cardiovascular diseases (Adlercreutz et al. 1992; Adlercreutz &
Mazur, 1997; Raffaelli et al. 2002; Arts & Hollman, 2005).
Secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol have been quantified in a
large number of plant foods. Flaxseed (linseed) is the richest
known source of these lignans. Other sources are grains, seeds,
vegetables, fruits and beverages (Mazur, 1998; Mazur & Adler-
creutz, 1998; Horn-Ross et al. 2000; Meagher & Beecher,
2000). These data have been incorporated into several phytoestro-
gen databases (Horn-Ross et al. 2000; Keinan Boker et al. 2002;
Valsta et al. 2003). Until now, data on the lariciresinol and pinor-
esinol contents of foods were not available.
A number of epidemiological studies on the associations
between enterolignan concentrations in biological fluids or the
intake of plant lignans and chronic disease risk has so far been
conducted (reviewed by Arts & Hollman, 2005). In case–control
studies (Ingram et al. 1997; Pietinen et al. 2001; Dai et al. 2002),
but not in prospective studies (Den Tonkelaar et al. 2001; Hulten
et al. 2002; Grace et al. 2004), inverse associations have been
found between plasma or urinary lignans and breast cancer risk.
For cardiovascular diseases, inverse associations with serum lig-
nans were reported in two Finnish studies (Vanharanta et al.
1999, 2003). In addition, studies in which the relation between
the dietary intake of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol and
cancer risk was studied gave conflicting results. Protective associ-
ations were reported for breast (McCann et al. 2002), ovarian
(McCann et al. 2003), endometrial (Horn-Ross et al. 2003) and
thyroid (Horn-Ross et al. 2002a) cancer. In one study, a decreased
risk of breast cancer was found only for high intakes of mataire-
sinol, but not for secoisolariciresinol or secoisolariciresinol plus
matairesinol (Linseisen et al. 2004). In two other studies,
increased breast cancer risks were found with a high intake of
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol (Horn-Ross et al. 2001;
2002b).
To further evaluate the health effects of lignan intake, it is
essential that the newly discovered enterolignan precursors are
included. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compile a
comprehensive database including all four major enterolignan

precursors: lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and
matairesinol. Lignans were quantified in 109 plant foods com-
monly consumed in the Netherlands, including eighty-three
solid foods and twenty-six beverages. Additionally, we studied
the effect of cooking on the lignan content of a few vegetables.
Materials and methods
Selection of foods
Plant foods were selected for analysis based on data from
the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey conducted in
1997–98. This survey was carried out among a sample of house-
holds representative of the Dutch population. Two-day dietary
records were collected for 6250 persons aged 1–97 years (Hul-
shof & Van Staveren, 1991; Voedingscentrum, 1998).
In general, plant foods with an average consumption of over 3 g
per person per day were selected. Mixed dishes (e.g. apple pie,
pizza) were not selected for analysis since their lignan content
can be calculated from their ingredients using standard recipes.
For fruits, a limit of 1 g per person per day was used. Because
of their relatively high consumption, a limit of 10 g per person
per day was used for beverages. Waters and soft drinks (except
cola) were disregarded. Apple juice was not analysed because
the lignan content of apples was very low (see below). Vegetable
oils and fats with an average consumption of over 0·5 g per person
per day were also added. Using this method, forty-two plant foods
were selected. Some important plant foods, for example leek and
sweet pepper, were missed because they are ingredients of a large
number of foods but are not consumed in large quantities as such.
We therefore also used data on the consumption of primary agri-
cultural products. These data were derived from the Food Con-
sumption Survey data using the Conversion Model for Primary
Agricultural Products developed at RIKILT (Van Dooren-Flipsen
et al. 1995). Four extra fruits and eleven extra vegetables were
selected, using the same criteria as before. In addition, foods
that were high in lignans according to data in the literature, but
did not meet the aforementioned consumption criteria, were
also selected (e.g. seeds, olives, cashew nuts). Tofu, soya milk
and legumes were added since they might be important plant
foods for specific population groups (e.g. vegetarians).
Sample collection
Foods were purchased in the form (fresh, canned, in jars, frozen)
that was most commonly consumed according to the Food Con-
sumption Survey. In order to enhance the representation of the
food samples, products were bought at three different locations
(fresh products) or from three major brands (processed foods),
and composite samples were assembled. In addition, for fresh pro-
ducts, a minimum of 0·5 kg or 3 units was sampled at each
location: an outlet of a nationwide supermarket chain, a local gro-
cery and an open-air street market. The proportion in the compo-
site samples reflected the sales of each food group at each
location. For vegetables, the supermarket accounted for 78 %,
the grocery for 11 % and the open-air market for 11 %; for
fruits, these values were 70 %, 12 % and 18 %, respectively. Pota-
toes were bought at two supermarkets (each contributing 45 %)
and a local grocery store (contributing 10 %). Breads were also
bought at two supermarkets (each contributing 37·5 %) and a
local bakery (contributing 25 %). For processed foods, composite
samples were assembled by mixing the three brands in equal
proportions.
Sample preparation
Non-edible parts were removed from the fruit and vegetables.
Vegetables were not prepared further since cooking or frying
was considered to have only a small effect on lignan content.
This assumption was based on the fact that the first step in the
lignan analysis consisted of the alkaline extraction for 1 h at
608C, which did not lead to a considerable loss of lignans
(Milder et al. 2004). However, we checked this assumption,
because during cooking and frying temperatures are higher and
lignans might also be lost by leaching. A few vegetables were
therefore analysed both raw and prepared according to standard
recipes. Lignans in potatoes, rice and macaroni were determined
in the prepared product according to standard recipes or the
instructions on the packaging.
Composites of solid foods were either directly chopped under
liquid N2 or cut into smaller pieces prior to freezing in liquid
N2, and stored at 2208C until freeze-drying was started within
1 month. After freeze-drying, samples were ground to a powder
using a Tecator Knifetec 1095 sample mill (Rose Scientific Ltd,
Edmonton, Canada). Dry products, which did not require
freeze-drying, such as seeds, muesli and wheat (meal and whole-
grain), were ground before preparing the composite samples.
Fruits were frozen in liquid N2 before grinding. All composites
of solid foods were stored at 2208C until analysis.
Beverages were collected within 48 h of analysis. Composites
were prepared immediately before analysis by mixing three
major brands in equal proportions. Beer was degassed in an ultra-
sonic bath at room temperature. Since alcohol might influence the
activity of the enzyme used in the analytical method, beer and
wine were analysed both with and without the evaporation of
alcohol (using a Zymark Turbo vap LV Evaporator;
Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA, USA) at 608C, under a mild N2
flow (5–10 psi). Since the evaporation of alcohol produced no
substantial changes in lignan concentrations, and increased the
variation between duplicate samples, the lignan values of the ana-
lyses without the evaporation of alcohol are presented here. Tea
infusion was prepared by placing one tea bag (1 or 2 g) in boiling
tap water (100 ml/g tea leaves). After 5 min, the tea bag was stir-
red a few times, after which it was removed. Coffee was prepared
according to Dutch custom in a coffee-maker with paper filter: a
volume of 275 ml boiling water was dripped on 14 g ground
coffee. Chocolate milk was diluted ten times with sodium acetate
buffer (0·05 M, pH 5·0), in order to avoid gelling during the ether
extraction.
Standards
Pure standards of secoisolariciresinol (purity approximately 92 %)
and matairesinol (purity .98 %) were obtained from Plantech
(Reading, England). Lariciresinol isolated from the wood of
Abies sachalinensis and pinoresinol isolated from Euconmia
ulmoides oliv. bark were kindly provided by Dr Ozawa
(Rakuno Gakuen University, Japan), Dr Deyama (Yomeishu
Seizo Co. Ltd, Japan) and Dr Nishibe (University of
Hokkaido, Japan). Internal standards of secoisolariciresinol-d8
and matairesinol-d6 were kindly provided by Dr K. Wa¨ha¨la¨
(University of Helsinki, Finland).

Analytical method
The four major enterolignan precursors lariciresinol, pinoresi-
nol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were measured in
each food sample using a liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry method previously described in detail
(Milder et al. 2004). In brief, lignans were extracted from
solid foods with methanol–water (70:30 v/v) containing 0·3 M
NaOH at 608C for 1 h. After neutralising and centrifuging, an
aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to a test-tube, and
methanol was evaporated under a mild N2 flow. The extract
obtained, or pure beverage, was incubated overnight with
Helix pomatia b-glucuronidase/sulphatase in sodium acetate
buffer (0·05 M, pH 5·0) at 378C. After enzymatic hydrolysis,
samples were extracted twice with diethyl ether. The organic
phases were combined, evaporated to dryness and dissolved
in methanol–water (30:70 v/v). Internal deuterated standards
were added, and samples were subjected to liquid chromatog-
raphy–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, with atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization in the negative-ion mode. Multiple
reaction monitoring was performed with the following precur-
sor/product combinations: lariciresinol (359·1/329·1), and secoi-
solariciresinol (361·1/165·1) with internal standard
secoisolariciresinol-d8 (369·2/168·3), and pinoresinol (357·1/
151·2) and matairesinol (357·1/83·1) with internal standard
matairesinol-d6 (363·2/83·1).
Analytical quality control
Control samples were included at the beginning and end of
each series of analyses. Single batches of freeze-dried and
ground broccoli and wholegrain wheat bread were used as con-
trol samples for solid foods. These samples had been stored at
2208C. Black tea infusion was used as a control sample for
beverages. One batch of tea leaves was prepared by passing
black tea (from tea bags) through two sieves of 0·8 and
0·355 mm. The middle fraction was stored at room temperature
for use as a control product. For each series of analyses, a fresh
tea infusion was prepared by adding 100 ml boiling tap water to
1 g tea leaves. After 5 min, this was stirred, and 50 ml was fil-
tered through a 1·2mm Acrodisc filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA).
Calibration standards of 20, 100, 200, 600 and 1000 ng/ml of
each lignan, with 200 ng/ml of deuterated standards, were
injected three times, at the beginning, middle and end of
each series of analyses. If the lignan values in the sample
extracts exceeded 1000 ng/ml, the sample was reanalysed after
diluting the alkaline extract. For solid foods, the limit of detec-
tion (signal to noise ratio of 3) for lariciresinol was 4mg/100 g
dry weight, for pinoresinol 10mg/100 g dry weight, and for
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol 6mg/100 g dry weight.
Depending on the moisture content of the food, this corre-
sponded to 0·2–10·0mg/100 g fresh weight. Detection limits
for beverages were for lariciresinol and matairesinol 0·2mg/
100 ml, for pinoresinol 0·4mg/100 ml, and for matairesinol
0·3mg/100 ml. The within-run reproducibility for the analysis
of the control samples was 6–21 % and the between-run repro-
ducibility 6–33 % (Milder et al. 2004). All samples were ana-
lysed in duplicate. If differences between the duplicates were
more than 20 %, the analysis was repeated and the mean
values of the two duplicate analyses were used.
Results and discussion
We found that almost all of the selected plant foods contained lig-
nans (Tables 1 and 2). Only four out of the 109 products did not con-
tain a measurable amount of lignans. The amount of lignans in plant
foods varied widely, from 0 to 301 000mg/100 g fresh weight. Inter-
estingly, in almost all products the newly discovered enterolignan
precursors lariciresinol and pinoresinol were found in higher con-
centrations than the well-known precursors secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol. Thus, databases with only secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan
precursors. Besides flaxseed, grain products have been the main
focus of lignan research. However, our results show that the
lignan contents of many of the vegetables and fruits are similar to
those of the grain products when lariciresinol and pinoresinol are
also included.
Any comparison of food composition data from various sources is
complicated by geographical differences in foods, such as plant var-
iety, growth conditions and food processing. Additional
differences may result from variations in the ripeness or season of
collection of the sampled foods. Keeping this in mind, we compared
our results primarily with lignan data reported by Mazur et al.
(1998a, b) and Horn-Ross et al. (2000) since these were the most
comprehensive sources.
Mazur and co-workers quantified secoisolariciresinol and
matairesinol in a variety of Finnish foods with isotope dilution
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Mazur et al. 1996),
and these data have been published in several original and
review publications (Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997; Mazur, 1998;
Mazur & Adlercreutz, 1998, 2000; Mazur et al. 1998a, b). How-
ever, as they report lignan values only on a dry weight basis, it is
not possible to compare our lignan values directly with these
results.
Recently, some additional lignan values were published on the
occasion of the construction of a Finnish phytoestrogen database
(Valsta et al. 2003). Since these data were expressed on a fresh
weight basis, we used these data in preference for comparison.
In general, our results for secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol
are in agreement with or slightly lower than those published by
Mazur et al., although larger differences exist for a few products,
which will be discussed below. Horn-Ross and co-workers
measured secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in foods from
California (Horn-Ross et al. 2000). They also used an HPLC–
mass spectrometry method for quantification. In general, our
data for secoisolariciresinol are in agreement with or slightly
higher than their results. However, since their limit of
detection is relatively high (25mg/100 g) compared with ours
(0·2–10·0mg/100 g), they found lignan concentrations to be
below the detection limit in many products.
The lignan contents reported in this paper are measured after
alkaline extraction from solid foods. Under alkaline conditions,
ester-linked oligomers of secoisolariciresinol in flax are hydro-
lysed to give the lignan monomer (Ford et al. 2001). Alkaline
hydrolysis increased the lignan yield of flax about five-fold, but
lignan yields from broccoli and bread were also substantially
increased (Milder et al. 2004). Although we only tested these pro-
ducts, this indicates that ester-linked lignans also occur in other
foods besides flax. In addition, because we showed that our care-
fully optimised alkaline extraction method gave reproducible
results (Milder et al. 2004), we decided to use this method for
our food analyses.

Ideally, the amount of lignans extracted by the analytical
method should reflect the lignans that are available in the
human body. So, can these ester-linked lignans be converted to
enterolignans in the human body? Until now, no bioavailability
studies have been performed that could answer this question.
Andreasen et al. (2001) showed that human small intestine
mucosa and colonic microflora contain esterase activity able to
release diferrulic acids from diferrulate esters, so it is likely
that these ester-linked lignans have physiological relevance.
Lapierre et al. (2001) showed that 8–80diferrulate is liberated
from bran lignins under alkaline conditions similar to ours, imply-
ing that our alkaline extract might contain lignans that had been
incorporated in lignin structures. A rat study indeed suggested
that lignins from wheat and rye bran increased the urinary
excretion of enterolignans (Begum et al. 2004). However, we
think that this paper probably overestimated the contribution of
these lignins to the enterolignan production. Thus, alkaline extrac-
tion seems to be able to account for physiologically relevant lig-
nans incorporated into lignins. Future human studies should,
however, provide insight into the real potential of various kinds
of bound lignans as enterolignan precursors.
The recovery of lignan aglycones added to control foods was
regarded as satisfactory (73–123 %), except for matairesinol
added to solid food (51–55 %) (Milder et al. 2004). Thus, the
concentrations of matairesinol in solid foods that we report here
are somewhat underestimated. The low recovery of added matair-
esinol is caused by its instability during alkaline extraction.
However, the yield of lignans (including matairesinol) from con-
trol foods was largely increased by the addition of NaOH during
the extraction (Milder et al. 2004). Thus, alkaline extraction
favours the release of matrix-bound matairesinol, which more
than compensates for losses by degradation. Besides, our own
and previous results show that the amount of matairesinol in
foods is usually relatively low compared with that of the other
enterolignan precursors. Thus, the underestimation of matairesi-
nol will have only a small effect on estimations of the total dietary
lignan content. In general, our results for matairesinol are lower
than those of Mazur (Mazur & Adlercreutz, 1998), but for some
products we found higher amounts. Horn-Ross et al. (2000)
detected matairesinol in only three foods. We measured two of
these foods and found lower amounts of matairesinol in both.
Oilseeds and nuts
The richest source of lignans was flaxseed. Flaxseed contained
mainly secoisolariciresinol (294 210mg/100 g), but pinoresinol, lar-
iciresinol and matairesinol were also present in substantial amounts
(553–3324mg/100 g). Most of the previously reported values for
secoisolariciresinol were higher than we found: 369 900mg/100 g
dry weight by Mazur & Adlercreutz (1998), 385 000–670 000
mg/100 g (converted from secoisolariciresinol diglucoside) by
Johnsson et al. (2000), 1 261 700 and 880 000mg/100 g by Liggins
et al. (2000), and 495 700–1 006 200mg/100 g by Kraushofer &
Sontag (2002a), but lower values were also reported (e.g.
81 700mg/100 g by Obermeyer et al. 1995). In addition, the
amount of matairesinol (553mg/100 g) was relatively low compared

with values previously reported: 1087mg/100 g dry weight
(Mazur & Aldercruetz, 1998), 5680 and 9090mg/100 g dry
weight (Ziggins et al. 2000) and 700–2850mg/100 g dry weight
(Kraushofer & Sontag, 2002b) Both pinoresinol (Meagher et al.
1999; Qui et al. 1999) and lariciresinol (Sicilia et al. 2003) have
previously been identified in flaxseed, but quantitative data were
not reported.
The second highest lignan concentration was found in sesame
seeds, but in this case pinoresinol was the main constituent
(29 331mg/100 g), and lariciresinol was also relatively abundant
(9470mg/100 g). The presence of pinoresinol in sesame seeds has
previously been described (Katsuzaki et al. 1992; Jiao et al. 1998;
Kato et al. 1998); it is a precursor of the sesame lignans piperitol,
sesamin and sesamolin (Jiao et al. 1998; Kato et al. 1998). The
total lignan concentrations in sunflower seeds (891mg/100 g) and
cashew nuts (629mg/100 g) were also relatively high, although
the concentrations of secoisolariciresinol were low compared with
those reported by Mazur & Adlercreutz (1998). Mazur detected
some matairesinol (4mg/100 g dry weight) in cashew nuts, which
we did not find. In poppy seeds, we detected only lariciresinol
(10mg/100 g), whereas Mazur & Adlercreutz (1998) also reported
the presence of secoisolariciresinol (14mg/100 g dry weight) and
matairesinol (12mg/100 g dry weight).
Grain products
Both wholegrain flaxseed bread and multigrain bread had
a high lignan content (12 500 and 6700mg/100 g), which
can be attributed to the flaxseed present in these breads.
For breads without flaxseed, the highest lignan concentration
was found in rye bread, but the levels of secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol were approximately two- to three-fold
lower than reported for Finnish rye (Nilsson et al. 1997a)
and rye bread (Juntunen et al. 2000). For wheat bread, wheat,
and rice, the lignan content decreased with the level of refine-
ment. This is in agreement with previous findings (for rye)
that lignans are mainly present in the short and bran of grain,
which are removed during the refining of grain products (Nilsson
et al. 1997b).
Vegetables and legumes
Brassica vegetables (cabbages, Brussel sprouts, kale) contained
unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185–2321mg/100 g),
mainly due to pinoresinol and lariciresinol. The amount of
pinoresinol plus lariciresinol in Brassica vegetables was on
average forty-five times higher than that of secoisolariciresinol

plus matairesinol. Our results for secoisolariciresinol in broccoli,
cabbage and Brussel sprouts agree well with those of Mazur, but
in broccoli and Brussel sprouts, they again report the presence of
some matairesinol. Horn-Ross et al. (2000) reported a similar
amount of secoisolariciresinol as we found in Brussel sprouts,
but they did not detect secoisolariciresinol or matairesinol in
broccoli.
Allium vegetables also contained substantial amounts of lig-
nans (36–536mg/100 g). The concentration of secoisolariciresinol
in garlic reported by Horn-Ross et al. (2000) was approximately
half of what we found, but they reported 38mg/100 g matairesi-
nol, which we did not detect in garlic. The amount of secoisolar-
iciresinol in garlic reported by Mazur & Adlercreutz (1998) was
approximately twice as high as we found, and they reported
only trace amounts of matairesinol. For leeks, the concentration
of secoisolariciresinol reported by Valsta et al. (2003) was
approximately three times lower than we found, and they also
did not detect matairesinol.
French beans (273mg/100 g), sweet peppers (green: 172mg/
100 g; red: 113mg/100 g), carrots (171mg/100 g) and courgettes
(119mg/100 g) also had relatively high lignan concentrations. For
all other vegetables, the total lignan concentrations were below
100mg/100 g.
Fruits
Lignan values ranged from 0 for banana to 450mg/100 g for apricot.
Valsta et al. (2003) reported the lignan contents of six fruits, of
which we also measured five. The concentrations of secoisolarici-
resinol and matairesinol in pear, grapefruit, olive and kiwi were
somewhat higher than we found, whereas we found a higher
amount of secoisolariciresinol in grapes. Horn-Ross et al. (2000)
were able to detect secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in
only a few dried fruits (apricots, prunes, raisins) and in peaches.
The concentrations they reported for peaches agree well with ours.
Strawberries had a total lignan concentration of 334mg/100 g.
Mazur et al. (2000) found relatively high levels of secoisolarici-
resinol in berries. Although we did not find a large amount of
secoisolariciresinol in strawberries, the amounts of lariciresinol
and pinoresinol were relatively large.
Raisins (white and blue) were one of the few products in which
we detected matairesinol (19 and 18mg/100 g, respectively).
However, the amount of matairesinol in raisins was low compared
with that of lariciresinol (153 and 118mg/100 g for white and blue
raisins respectively). Horn-Ross et al. (2000) reported a higher
concentration of matairesinol in raisins (52mg/100 g) and only
trace amounts of secoisolariciresinol.
The lignan concentration in apple was only 1mg/100 g, which is
interesting because apple is an important source of other polyphe-
nols such as flavonoids (Hertog et al. 1992; Arts et al. 2000).
In addition, Mazur & Adlercreutz (1998) and Horn-Ross et al.
(2000) reported only trace amounts of lignans in apple.
Vegetable oils and fats
The amount of pinoresinol in extra-virgin olive oil (243mg/100 g)
was higher than that in regular olive oil (101mg/100 g). This is in
agreement with the data published by Owen et al. (2000), who
found low levels of lignans in refined olive oil but lignan levels
of 65–10 000mg/100 g in extra-virgin oils. These lignans were
identified as pinoresinol, 1-acetoxypinoresinol and 1-hydroxypinor-
esinol. The amount of pinoresinol that we found in extra-virgin oil
(of unknown origin), was much lower than that found in Spanish
extra-virgin olive oils (range 2000–4500mg/100 g; Brenes et al.
2002b). Possibly, extra-virgin olive oil in the Netherlands is more
refined than in Spain. Margarine was also selected for analysis,
since it contains vegetable fats. The lignan concentration in margar-
ine was 39mg/100 g; it contained mainly secoisolariciresinol.
No lignans were found in soya and sunflower oil.
Other solid foods
The concentration of lignans in tomato paste was higher than that of
tomato, which can of course be explained by the concentration step
that takes place during manufacturing. It also shows that lignans can
(at least partially) survive the production process of tomato paste.
Soya products have primarily been included in phytoestrogen
databases because of the high amount of isoflavones in soya,
but soyabeans were additionally shown to contain a relatively
high amount of secoisolariciresinol (13–273mg/100 g; Mazur
et al. 1998a). In tofu, however, we found only 18mg/100 g.
Horn-Ross et al. (2000) also detected a relatively high amount
of secoisolariciresinol (140mg/100 g) in soyabeans, but did not
detect any secoisolariciresinol or matairesinol in tofu. This is in
agreement with our result, because of their high limit of detection
of 25mg/100 g.
Cocoa powder and plain chocolate contained a substantial
amount of lignans, although the amount of secoisolariciresinol
was approximately 50 % lower than that reported by Valsta et al.
(2003). Similar to our findings, they did not detect any matairesinol.
Alcoholic beverages
Wine, especially red wine, is an important source of several poly-
phenols (Manach et al. 2004), and we found that it also
contained a relatively high concentration of lignans. Red wine con-
tained on average 80mg/100 ml, whereas white wine contained
22mg/100 ml. Secoisolariciresinol was the most abundant lignan
in wine, except in one white wine in which lariciresinol was more
abundant. Our results for secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol
were slightly lower than those reported by Mazur (1998).
Nurmi et al. (2003) analysed lignans in wines using HPLC with
coulometric electrode array detection. Besides secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol, they also included other plant lignans. Their
results for secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol and lariciresinol
were slightly lower than ours. They could not exactly quantify
pinoresinol but reported that the amount was similar to that of larici-
resinol, which is also in agreement with our results.
On average, lager beer contained more lignans (27mg/100 ml)
than white wine but less than red wine. Beer contained mainly
pinoresinol and lariciresinol, and only a little secoisolariciresinol.
Non-alcoholic beverages
For the non-alcoholic beverages, the highest amount of lignans was
found in tea, a product that is a rich source of various other polyphe-
nols (Manach et al. 2004). The amounts of lignans in the three blends
of black tea that were analysed were comparable (64–77mg/
100 ml), but the amount of lignans in green tea was lower (39mg/
100 ml). Mazur et al. (1998b) expressed the lignan values of tea
infusions on a mg/kg tea leaves basis. If we convert our tea infusion
values to mg/kg tea leaves, our results for secoisolariciresinol are
Lignan contents of plant foods 399
approximately 1·5–2·5-fold lower than those of Mazur and
co-workers, whereas the results for matairesinol are similar.
For the preparation of their tea infusion, both the amount of tea
leaves (per ml water) and the extraction time used by Mazur and
co-workers were twice that of our method. Since we found lower
values of secoisolariciresinol in both black and green tea, this
might indicate that a higher proportion of secoisolariciresinol
could be extracted with longer extraction times. However, our
aim was to analyse tea infusion as it is commonly consumed in
the Netherlands.
The amount of lignans in coffee was lower than that in tea
(19–31mg/100 ml), which is consistent with the results of
Mazur et al. (1998b).
The total lignan concentration in juices was 7–25mg/100 ml. As
for red wine, and blue grapes, the amount of lignans was higher in
blue grape juice than in white grape juice. In general, therefore,
the lignan content of blue grapes seems higher than that of white
grapes, although the amount of lignans in white raisins was higher
than in blue raisins. We did not find a difference between orange
juice with and without pulp. We hypothesised that this could be
caused by the fact that lignans were not released from the pulp.
We thus also analysed juice with pulp with the method for solid
foods (including alkaline extraction). This resulted in slightly
lower lignan concentrations compared with the analysis without
alkaline extraction (results not shown). Thus, the pulp in orange
juice did not contain a measurable amount of lignans.
Soya milk contained 38mg lignans/100 ml, mainly pinoresinol
and lariciresinol. We measured only 1mg/100 ml of secoisolari-
ciresinol in soya milk, whereas Adlercreutz et al. (2000) found
10–20mg/100 g in soya milk and drinks. Horn-Ross et al.
(2000) reported 32mg/100 ml secoisolariciresinol in soya milk.
Effect of cooking of vegetables
Lignan values in boiled vegetables were on average 25 %
lower than those in raw vegetables (Table 3), whereas after
frying, lignan concentrations were on average 30 % higher.
The increased lignan concentrations after frying can be
explained mainly by the decreased moisture content of the
fried foods. On a dry weight basis, the amount of lignans
after frying decreased by 25 %, comparable to what we saw
for boiling. The vegetables were fried in margarine, which
we have shown also to contain some lignans. However, we cal-
culated that the maximum contribution from lignans in the mar-
garine was less than 1 %.
To our knowledge, effects of food preparation on lignan
content have only been reported for baking bread, thermal treat-
ments of olive oil, and roasting of pumpkin seeds. Muir & West-
cott (2000) reported that secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (purified
or as flaxseed), added to wheat flour before the preparation of
bread, was stable in the bread making process. Besides, they
found that secoisolariciresinol diglucoside could withstand the
higher temperatures in the core during baking. Brenes et al.
(2002a) found that microwave heating of olive oil for 10 min
did not change the amount of lignans, including pinoresinol.
Even after 25 h (simulated) frying at 1808C, only 20–50 % of
the lignans were lost, whereas other phenolic compounds were
almost completely destroyed. When olive oil was boiled with
water (at pH 4–6) for 30 min, a large proportion of lignans lea-
ched into the water phase, but the total decrease in the lignan con-
centration was only 30 %, irrespective of the pH. Murkovic et al.
(2004) reported that secoisolariciresinol in pumpkin seeds was
completely destroyed after 20 min of roasting. Thus, a further
evaluation of the effects of food processing might increase the
reliability of lignan intake estimations.
In summary, almost all of the 109 measured products contained
lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pino-
resinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol.
Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of
enterolignan precursors in foods. The database reported here will
enable a more comprehensive evaluation of the health effects of
lignan intake.
