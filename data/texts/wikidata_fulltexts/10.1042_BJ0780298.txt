It is now well established that the C15 skeleton of
the flavonoid molecule is synthesized in plants by
the condensation of three acetate units with
phenylpyruvic acid (Watkin, Underhill & Neish,
1957). Much less is known about how this skeleton
is then elaborated by hydroxylation, methylation
and glycosidation. In order to obtain more in-
formation about these later stages in biosynthesis,
the flavonoids present in several series of colour
mutants of cultivated plants are being reinvesti-
gated with recently developed methods of pigment
analysis (see Harborne, 1958a, b, 1959). The results
obtained for the diploid potato, Solanum phureja,
have already been described (Harborne, 1960a).
The present account is of a similar investigation of
the phenolic pigments of Primula 8inen8i8, of
which many colour mutants of known genetic
constitution are available for biochemical analysis
(De Winton & Haldane, 1933; De Winton, 1936).
Scott-Moncrieff (1936) and Dayton (1954) have
shown that in the inheritance of pigmentation in
P. 8inen8i8, gene K controls the production of
malvidin 3-monoside in mauve flowers. Recessive
genotypes (kk) have coral flowers and contain
pelargonidin 3-monoside. Another gene, Dz, inde-
pendently of K, also controls production of pelar-
gonidin monoside, though its activity is obscured by
complicated dosage and dominance relationships.
KDz types contain mixtures of malvidin and pelar-
gonidin glycosides and are various shades of red or
bluish red; kDz types contain pelargonidin 3-
monoside only and are bright orange. Gene R
lowers the pH of the cell sap by 0 6 unit so that
KR flowers are redder than Kr flowers. A gene B
has a bluing effect on flower colour, by producing
flavone copigments, provisionally identified as a
mixture of kampferol glycosides. Other genes con-
trol pigment distribution; e.g. geneD inhibits colour
in the flowers. Finally, genes whose main effect is
on morphological characters (e.g. leaf shape) may
sometimes have minor effects on pigment synthesis.
In spite of all the genetical information avail-
able, only one pigment in P. 8inenri8 has previously
been fully characterized. This is 'primulin', which

was isolated from mauve flowers by Scott-Mon-
crieff (1936) and identified by Bell & Robinson
(1934) as malvidin 3-galactoside. That Scott-
Moncrieff's pigment must, however, have been the
3-glucoside is shown by the present work, in which
21 glycosides have been identified. They are
derived from ten known flavonoid aglycones and
all contain glucose and not galactose as their only
sugar.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material. The 43 genotypes of Primula 8inensis
have been grown under glasshouse conditions from self-
seed of diploid lines of plants used in earlier investigations
(Scott-Moncrieff, 1936; Dayton, 1954) but also include a
few tetraploid lines and some commercial varieties.
Authentisc pigment8. Known anthocyanins and antho-
cyanidins were obtained as already described (Harborne,
1958a, 1960a). Crystalline specimens of primulin, isolated
by Miss R. Scott-Moncrieff, were made available by Miss
V. C. Sturgess. Kampferol 3-glucoside and 3-rhamno-
glucoside were obtained from Professor L. Horhammer,
Munich. Dihydrokampferol (aromadendrin) and its acetate
were supplied by Dr R. A. Laidlaw. Kampferol 7-glucoside
was prepared from naringenin 7-glucoside (Seikel, 1955) by
treatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (Simpson &
Whalley, 1955) and then with hot dilute acid.
Paper chromatography and spectroscopy. Conditions used
for the paper chromatography of phenolic pigments have
been described (Harborne, 1958b, 1959). The solvent
mixtures used were: A, butan-l-ol-2N-HCl (1:1, vfv;
upper phase); B, butan-l-ol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5, by
vol.; upper phase); (, acetic acid-water (15:85, v/v); D,
butan-l-ol-benzene-pyridine-water (5:1:3:3, by vol.); E,
butan-l-ol-ethanol-water (4:1:5, by vol.); F, butan-l-ol-
water (1:1, v/v; upper phase); G, water; H, water-conc.
HCl (97:3, v/v); 1, phenol saturated with water.
The spectra of phenolic pigments were determined by the
methods of Geissman (1955), Jurd & Horowitz (1957) and
Harborne (1958a). Measurements were made with a
Unicam SP. 500 spectrophotometer.
Extraction of the anthocyanins. Fresh petals or foliar
parts were homogenized in methanol containing 1% of
conc. HCI. After centrifuging and re-extraction of the
residue, the supernatants were combined and evaporated
in vacuo to a small volume. The concentrate was filtered
and the filtrate washed successively with light petroleum
and ethyl acetate. When storage was necessary, the extract
was first freeze-dried, the product being purified by solution
in methanol, followed by precipitation with dry ether; it
298

was kept in a desiccator and used within 3 months of its
preparation.
Separation, purification and identification of the antho-
cyanins. The methods used have been described by
Harborne (1958a, b, 1960a). The anthocyanin concentrates
were separated by chromatography on Whatman no. 3
paper with solvent A. Successive chromatography in
solvents A, B and C of the pigment bands thus obtained
eventually gave solutions of pure anthocyanins. Fifteen
chromatographically distinct pigments were thus obtained
from the genotypes investigated; the best sources of these
pigments are given in Table 1. When an anthocyanin was
obtained from more than one genotype, identity was
established by cochromatography, spectroscopic analysis
and examination of the products of acid hydrolysis.
In view of the report of Bell & Robinson (1934) that the
major anthocyanin of P. sinensis (A 13, Table 1) contains
galactose, special care was taken in identifying the mono-
saccharide produced on acid hydrolysis ofthe anthocyanins.
The sugar specimens were inseparable from added glucose,
but separated from added galactose on paper chromato-
grams developed in solvents B, D or E for 36-48 hr. The
sugars were oxidized by notatin and also gave the same
distinctive colour as glucose when treated with resorcinol
in sulphuric acid (Harborne, 1960a).
Isolation and identification of the fiavonol glucosides.
Fresh white petals from plants of Alexandra Beetle KKDD
genotype were extracted with boiling methanol for 0-5 hr.
After filtration, the extract was concentrated in vacuo to a
small volume and filtered. The pale-yellow extract was
separated by chromatography on Whatman no. 3 paper in
solvent B. The five bands (F 1-5; Table 2) were purified by
chromatography in solvents C, F and G. Eluates of the
two major bands F2 and F4 gave pale-yellow, water-
soluble, non-crystalline solids after evaporation to dryness.
These were purified further by precipitation with light
petroleum from moist butanol. Both compounds retained
water of crystallization, even after they had been dried at
1000 in vacuo for 10 hr. F2 had m.p. 204° (Found: C, 51-3;
H, 5-4. C27H30016,3H20 requires C, 51-1; H, 5-7%). F4
had m.p. 234-236° (Found: C, 50-6; H, 5-9. C33H40021pH20
requires C, 50-1; H, 5-4%). F2 and F4 had the same infra-
red spectra as known kampferol 3-glycosides (e.g. the 3-
glucoside). The other three flavonol glucosides were not
present in sufficient amounts for characterization in the
above-described manner. The five compounds F1-5 and
the aglycones and sugars they give on acid hydrolysis were
identified by similar methods to those described (Nord-
strom & Swain, 1953; Harborne, 1959). Sugar:aglycone
ratios were determined as described by Harborne (1960a).
The sugar was also determined by the resorcinol-sulphuric
acid reagent (Devor, Conger & Gill, 1958), since the
flavonol aglycones do not interfere with the colour pro-
duced in this reaction.
Determination of the position of sugar residues of the
flavonols. Measurement of the absorption spectra of Fl-5
in ethanol and then in ethanol containing inorganic ions
(see Table 2) indicated that only the 3- position in these
flavonol molecules contains a sugar substituent (see Jurd &
Horowitz, 1957). This was confirmed in the following way.
The five pigments were fully methylated and then hydro-
lysed with acid (Nordstrom & Swain, 1953). The products
were then compared with the respective authentic, partially
methylated flavonols. 5:7:4'-Trimethylkampferol and
7:4'-dimethylkampferol were prepared as described above
from kampferol 3-glucoside and robinin (kampferol 3-
rhamnosylgalactoside, 7-rhamnoside). The former sub-
stance and the products from F2 and F4 had Am... in 95%
ethanol at 257 and 351 m,u, in 95% ethanol-NaOH at
260 and 390 mi& and in ethanol-sodium acetate at 257 mI.;
the latter compound had L. in 95% ethanol at 265
and 338 mZ and in ethanol-sodium acetate at 270 mp.
R, values and colour of these two compounds have been
recorded (Harborne, 1959). The products from F3 and F5
were similarly found to be identical with 5:7:3':4'-tetra-
methylquercetin (Herrmann, 1958). The products from F 1
and from myricitrin (myricetin 3-rhamnoside) were also
identical.
Isolation and identification of sinensin. Fresh orange
flowers of Dazzler (kkDzDz) genotype were extracted with
methanol containing 1% of conc. HCI. After filtration, the
extract was evaporated in vacuo to an aqueous residue.
Alternatively, dried powdered petals were extracted with
0-3N-HC1. In either case, the aqueous solutions were
repeatedly extracted with small volumes of ethyl acetate.
Evaporation of the ethyl acetate extracts gave a hygro-
scopic white powder which was purified by chromatography
in solvent G on Whatman no. 3 paper to give sinensin
(Rp 0-72) and an oxidation product (Rp 0-02). After
precipitation from a cold methanolic solution with light
petroleum, sinensin had m.p. 1820 (decomp.). On acid
hydrolysis it gave glucose, and an aglycone which, after
three recrystallizations from water, separated as colourless
needles, m.p. 238-240' (decomp.) and mixed m.p. with
dihydrokampferol 236-2380 (decomp.) (Found: C, 61-8;
H, 4-3. Calc. for C,5HL206: C, 62-5; H, 4-2%). Theaglycone
and dihydrokampferol had the same Rp values and ultra-
violet spectra (see Table 2), and both gave pelargonidin on
reductive acetylation (Pacheco, 1957). The structure of
sinensin was confirmed by identifying its oxidation product
(isolated as described above or from aqueous solutions of
sinensin which had been boiled for 4 hr.) as kampferol
7-glucoside (Table 2).
Provisional identification of a derived disaccharide.
Chromatograms of the acid hydrolysates of pigments that
contained more than one glucose residue (notably A2, F2
and F4) showed the presence, after spraying with aniline
hydrogen phthalate, of glucose and a single disaccharide.
The same disaccharide was produced by heating the pig-
ments for 4 hr. in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, as was used for
preparing rutinose from rutin (Arakawa, 1956). This disac-
charide (Ra 0-27, 0-43) was chromatographically identical
with gentiobiose in solvents D and B and separated from
added cellobiose (BG 0-44, 0-58) and maltose (RG 0-52,
0-58). It was different from the disaccharide (RG 0-43, 0-61)
produced during the acid hydrolysis of pigments isomeric
with A2 and A5 which were isolated from Papaver rhoeas
and related species (see Results).
Survey of the flavonoids. Petal and leaf extracts of all the
colour genotypes were examined by one- and two-dimen-
sional paper chromatography. The presence or absence of
the 21 major pigments was determined by analysis of R,
values and colours. Acid hydrolysates of all the above-
mentioned extracts were similarly examined for the
presence or absence of the ten known flavonoid aglycones.
Measurement ofpigment concentrations. The centres of the
flowers (which contain plastid pigments) were removed by
means of a 12 mm. cork borer from fresh corollas (ten per

sample) of the genotype under examination. The samples
were weighed within 20 min. of picking and then extracted
by crushing them in known volumes of methanol-conc.
HCI (97:3, v/v). The extracts were stored for 24 hr. in the
dark at O0. Pigment concentrations were then estimated in
the filtered petal extracts by spectrophotometric measure-
ments at the appropriate absorption maxima; the results
were compared with similar measurements made on solu-
tions containing known amounts of pure pigment. Total
anthocyanin concentration was thus measured at 507 m,
for kk types and at 532 mjp for KK types. No other pig-
ments were present to interfere with anthocyanin spectra
in the visible region. Total flavonol glucoside concentration
was measured at the maxima in the 400-420 mp region
after addition of alkali to the petal extract. Interfering
substances such as cinnamic acids are virtually absent from
P. 8inenai8 petals; an alkaline solution of sinensin shows no
absorption in this region. Sinensin concentration was
measured at its A,,x at 287 mp after it had been separated
from other pigments by chromatography in solvent B and
subsequent elution. Results are given in Tables 3 and 6.
Measurements were also made of the relative amounts of
the various pigments on eluates of bands cut from chro-
matograms developed with solvent A or B, of fresh
extracts, or, in a few cases, of fresh extracts after acid
hydrolysis. Results are given in Tables 4 and 5.
RESULTS
Identification of the anthocyanin8
Fifteen anthocyanins have been found in
flowers and leaves of Pr-imula 8inen8is and some of
their properties are listed in Table 1. They all give
one of the six common anthocyanidins and glucose
on acid hydrolysis. No galactose was detected, in
spite of the earlier identification of the major
malvidin pigment (A 13 in Table 1) as the 3-
galactoside (Bell & Robinson, 1934). A specimen of
' primulin', isolated by Scott-Moncrieff (1936), gave
malvidin, mixed with petunidin (about 15 %), and
glucose on acid hydrolysis.
Quantitative acid hydrolyses of pigments A 1-3
give pelargonidin and one, two and three molecular
proportions of glucose respectively. The spectra
and colour of these three pigments are identical
and are the same as those of authentic pelargonidin
3-glucoside, but differ from those of known 3:5-
and 3:7-glucosides. Furthermore, A3 gives only
two intermediate glucosides (A2 and A1) during
acid hydrolysis; A2 gives only one (Al) and Al
gives none. Therefore the glucose residues of all
three pigments are attached to only one of the
four hydroxyl groups ofpelargonidin, the one in the
3- position. Similar hydrolysis experiments estab-
lish that the remaining pigments are 3-glucosides,
3-glucosylglucosides (3-diglucosides) or 3-glucosyl-
glucosylglucosides (3-triglucosides) of the other
five anthocyanidins. Lack of material has pre-
vented the measurement of sugar: aglycone ratios
in all 15 substances. However, their chromato-
graphic behaviour (Table 1) is strong evidence that
they all have the number of glucose residues
assigned to them. All but three out of the 18
possible combinations of six anthocyanidins with
three states of glucosidation have been identified.
The identity of pigments A1, A4, A6, A9, A10
and A 13 was confirmed by direct comparison with
authentic specimens of the six anthocyanidin 3-
glucosides. Pigments A2, AS, A7, All and A14
are the 3-diglucosides of pelargonidin, cyanidin,
peonidin, petunidin and malvidin respectively.
Since A2 and A5 are chromatographically different
from the pelargonidin and cyanidin 3-diglucosides,
known to occur in various Papaver spp. (Robinson
& Robinson, 1931; Harborne & Sherratt, 1957),
these five pigments are new compounds. Acid
hydrolysis of A2 and A5 yields, besides glucose, a
small quantity of a disaccharide, which appears to
be gentiobiose. As the isomeric cyanidin pigment
(mecocyanin) from poppy is supposed to be the
3-gentiobioside (Grove, Inubuse & Robinson,1934),
a re-examination of the two poppy anthocyanins
was carried out. On hydrolysis they give glucose
and a disaccharide, different in its chromatographic
behaviour from gentiobiose but similar to cello-
biose.
The remaining four pigments, A3, A8, A12 and
A 15, are the 3-triglucosides of pelargonidin,
peonidin, petunidin and malvidin and are also new
pigments. The related cyanidin 3-triglucoside has
been identified as occurring in acylated form in red
cabbage (Stroh, 1959), so that only the delphinidin
glycoside of this structure remains to be found.
Identification of the flavonol gluco8ide8
and of 8inen8in
Five main flavonol glucosides occur in flowers of
P. 8inen8i8 and at least three of them are also
present in the leaves. Their properties are given in
Table 2. They have been identified as the 3-di-
glucoside (F 2) and 3-triglucoside (F 4) ofkampferol,
the 3-diglucoside (F3) and 3-triglucoside (F5) of
quercetin and the 3-glucoside (Fl) of myricetin.
Only the last compound (cannibiscitrin) has been
thoroughly described before (see Karrer, 1958): it
occurs in the flowers of Hibiscus cannabinus, in
leaves of tea (Camellia) and in the seed-coat of
Pha8eolus vulgari. The 3-triglucosides ofkampferol
and quercetin were thought to occur in the leaves of
tea (Oshima & Nakabayashi, 1954), but reinvesti-
gation by Roberts, Cartwright & Wood (1956) did
not reveal them.
Sinensin (Harborne & Sherratt, 1958) is present
in nearly all genotypes of P. sinensis, but occurs in
quantity in flowers of only a few, e.g. the Dazzler
mutant. It has been identified as dihydrokampferol
7-glucoside. Its properties closely resemble those
of dihydrokampferol 7-methyl ether (Chopin &
300 1961

FLAVONOIDS OF PRIMULA SINENSIS
Pacheco, 1958) but differ from those of dihydro-
kampferol itself. This dihydroflavonol typically
occurs in the free state or as a 3-glycoside in heart-
wood of trees (Karrer, 1958) so that its presence as
the 7-glucoside in a herbaceous plant is of interest.
Di8tribution offlavonoid8
Hydroxylation of the flavonoid8. KK genotypes,
which have coloured flowers (red, maroon, mauve
or blue), contain varying amounts of the 3-
glucosides of malvidin, petunidin and delphinidin.
Myricetin, quercetin and kampferol glucosides are
also present and are the only pigments found in
white flowers of KKDD genotype. By contrast, kk
types lack pigments with the 3':4':5'-trihydroxyl-
ation pattern: in them the anthocyanidins are
pelargonidin, peonidin and cyanidin and the
flavonols are quercetin and kampferol. Gene K
therefore controls a simple step in biosynthesis, the
introduction of a 5'-hydroxyl group into a pre-
cursor common to both anthocyanidin and flavonol
pigments. Unlike other known genes with similar
effect in other plants (e.g. P in Solanum phureja,
Harborne, 1960a), it is incompletely dominant in
certain genetic backgrounds (see below and Dayton,
1954).
Anthocyanin concentration: the Dazzler factor.
KKDzDz plants normally have scarlet flowers and
contain the anthocyanins of KK forms, together
with those of kk forms. Plants of constitution
kkDzDz (orange flowers) differ from kkdzdz forms
(coral flowers) only by containing more of the same
anthocyanins. The concentrations of the three
types of pigments of flowers of kkDzDz and kkdzdz
genotypes have been measured and the results are
shown in Table 3. Whereas the amount of flavonol
glucoside and sinensin present is relatively con-
stant, there is a threefold increase in the amount of
pelargonidin glucosides on passing from the
recessive to the dominant genotype. The Dazzler
gene thus increases the total concentration of
anthocyanins, and only anthocyanins, in the flowers.
The production in KKDzDz plants of pelargonidin,
cyanidin and peonidin glucosides, anthocyanins
typical of the recessive kk forms (not, as might be
expected, more malvidin and petunidin 3-glu-
cosides), must be due to the fact that the amount of
enzyme available in KK types for 5'-hydroxylation
is strictly limited.
Methylation of the anthocyanin8. There are
noticeable differences in the degree of methylation
between different genotypes and between different
tissues of the same genotype. The proportions of
3-glucosides of delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin
in the flowers of a series of KK genotypes are
recorded in Table 4. The amount of methylation is
greatest in the wild-type plant and in six other BB
forms examined (measurements on only one
typical example are given in Table 4). Genotypes
recessive for the b or copigment gene have 10% less
malvidin present. Methylation is further decreased
in some morphological mutants, being, indeed,
absent from the 'Duchess Fern Leaf' form. These
results suggest that there are genes controlling

methylation in P. s8nen8is and that they interact
with other genes.
The expected correlation between an increase in
methylation and a reddening effect on flower
colour (cf. Scott-Moncrieff, 1936) is not apparent
from the data of Table 4. Evidently, methylation
as a determinant of colour is masked by other
factors, such as copigmentation. The 'methylating
genes' are leas effective in their action in leaves
than in flowers: for example, petunidin is the

Glucosidation of the flavonoids. All but one of the
flavonols and anthocyanidins occur as 3-mono- -di-
or -tri-glucoside in relative amounts that vary with
the situation in the plant (Table 5): generally a
higher degree of glucosidation of the antho-
cyanidins occurs in leaves than in flowers. In
flowers of the KK series, 3-glucosides predominate;
3-triglucosides of petunidin and malvidin occur
exceptionally in traces in flowers of two out of the
15 KK genotypes available for examination. By
contrast, leaves of KK forms contain mainly tri-
glucosides. In kk genotypes the flowers contain
63% of the total anthocyanin as 3-glucoside,
whereas the leaves contain 75% as triglucoside.
Copigmentation. Gene B, which has a bluing
effect on flower colour, was originally thought
(Scott-Moncrieff, 1936) to control the production of
specific flavone copigments. Examination of the
flavonol glucosides of a variety of BB and bb
genotypes by paper chromatography shows, how-
ever, that qualitative differences in pigmentation
are not involved. Measurements were therefore
made of the amounts of anthocyanin and flavonol
glucoside in flowers of plants of two families, 36 and
37, which were known to be segregating for the B
factor (Table 6). Because of variations in the
amounts of both pigments in the flowers of indi-
vidual plants, the results are expresed as the ratio
of the flavonol glucoside concentration to the total
anthocyanin concentration. This ratio in mauve
flowers is consistently higher than in maroon
flowers. Copigmentation causes a shift of 4-5 m,
in the visible maximum of the anthocyanin
(mainly malvidin 3-glucoside), when measured on
fresh aqueous extracts. Similar shifts were pro-
duced when the purified kampferol 3-diglucoside
and 3-triglucoside were added separately to an
aqueous acid solution of malvidin 3-glucoside. It
is therefore a reasonable asumption that these
flavonol glucosides act as copigments, although
other factors (e.g. metal-ion concentration) may
determine their effectivenessi n this respect.

place P. sinensis in the section Sinenses of this
genus. The chemical results are consistent with this
classification. A striking similarity between all

FLAVONOIDS OF PRIMULA SINENSIS3
constant occurrence of anthocyauins which contain
glucose as their only sugar. Thus malvidin 3-
glucoside has been found in P. polyanthus (Scott-
Moncrieff, 1930), malvidin 3:5-diglucoside in P.
v8G0co8a and in P. integrifolia (Karrer & Widmer,
1927), malvidin, petunidin and delphinidin 3:5-
diglucoside in P. obconica (J. B. Harborne, un-
published work) and hirsutidin 3:5-diglucoside in
P. hirsuta (Karrer & Widmer, 1927). P. 8$,nen#s
also shares with at least two other species its
ability to add trisacchaxide residues to the 3-
hydroxyl group of the flavonols: kampferol and
quercetin 3-triglucoside have been found in
flowers and leaves respectively of P. obconica and
the former pigment occurs in flowers of P. rosea
(J. B. Harborne, unpublished work). There are,
however, at least three ways in which P. 8inen8is
differs from other members of the Primulaceae. It
apparently lacks the ability that plants such as
P. hir8uta and P. rosea possess of both methylating
the 7-hydroxyl group and also glucosidating the
5-hydroxyl group of its anthocyanins. And, unlike
the other species, it can synthesize a dihydro-
flavonol 7-glucoside: sinensin appears to be a
characteristic pigment of P. 8inen8is.
DISCUSSION
The original observation of Scott-Moncrieff
(1936) that gene K in Primula 8inen8is controls the
production of malvidin, in place of pelargonidin,
does not appear to fit the 'one gene-one enzyme'
hypothesis, since at least three biochemical pro-
cesses separate the two pigments. The present
study helps to resolve this difficulty. Traces of
delphinidin and cyanidin found respectively inKK
and kk genotypes (as glucosides) show that K has,
in fact, only one biochemical effect on pigment
production. It controls the introduction of a 5'-
hydroxyl group into a precursor common to both
the anthocyanidins and the flavonols. It is thus
parallel in its action to P in Solanum phureja
(Harborne, 1960a), 0 in Streptocarpuq (Lawrence &
Sturgess, 1957) and L in Impatien8 balsamina
(Alston & Hagen, 1958; Clevenger, 1958).
A feature of flower pigmentation in P. sinensiw is
the predominance of compounds containing the
4'-hydroxyl grouping (e.g. pelargonidin, kampferol,
dihydrokamnpferol) orthe 3':4':5'-trihydroxyl group-
ing (e.g. malvidin, petunidin). Cyanidin and
quercetin, i.e. compounds with the 3':4'-dihydroxyl
grouping, are relatively unimportant. This result
fits the thesis of Lawrence & Sturgess (1957) that
cyanidin (and quercetin) are most readily pro-
duced in the plant and appear in the flowers of
more highly evolved plants, such as Streptocarpue8,
only as 'biosynthetic residues'.
The discovery ofKK genotypes, in which there is
20
variation in the degree of methylation of the petal
anthocyanins, indicates that there are genes
present for the control of this process. Though yet
unidentified in P. 8inen8is, a parallel study has
revealed the presence of two such genes controlling
the methylation of delphinidin in P. obconica
(Harborne, 1960c).
As in a number of other plants (Harborne,
1960c), there is a close biogenetic relationship
between the flavonols and anthocyanidins present
in P. 8inen&w and their glycosidation pattern. Not
only are the sugars attached to the same hydroxyl
group of the anthocyanidins and the flavonols, but
also parallel mono-, di- and tri-glucosides have
been isolated in both series. In contrast, there
appears to be no corresponding link between the
flavonols and the dihydroflavonol. Indeed, the
production of dihydrokampferol, which occurs as
the 7-glucoside (sinensin) by direct reduction of
kampferol, present as the 3-di- or tri-glucoside,
seems unlikely in view of the difference in the
glucosidation pattern of the two classes of pig-
ment. Furthermore, there is no evidence that such
a reduction occurs earlier in biosynthesis since the
dihydroflavonols related to quercetin and myricetin
have not been detected. The inheritance of sinensin
is independent of the known genes (e.g. K) in-
volved in pigment synthesis. Sinensin appears to
be present in all the genotypes in traces; only its
concentration is affected by the activity of pig-
ment genes.
The presence in the same plant of related
flavonoid 3-glucosides, 3-diglucosides and 3-tri-
glucosides suggests that the glucose residues are
attached separately one at a time, rather than that
preformed di- and tri-saccharides are attached
directly in a single step to the pigment molecules.
The isolation from wheat germ (Cardini & Yamaha,
1960) of two enzymes which catalyse the synthesis
of phenolic mono- and di-glucosides respectively
supports this hypothesis. Since the same disac-
charide is produced when the anthocyanidin and
flavonol 3-di- and 3-tri-glucosides are hydrolysed,
it is possible that the saxne or similar enzymes
control the attachment of glucose residues to both
flavonols and anthocyanidins. It is generally
considered that in most plants anthocyanins and
flavones compete directly for a common precursor,
so that increased visual pigmentation is normally
correlated with decrease of flavone production and
vice versa. Indeed, there is evidence that the
genes K and B interact by competing for this
common precursor. The Dazzler gene is different in
that it increases anthocyanin concentration with-
out affecting the concentration of other flavonoids
present. The only other plant known to contain
genes with a similar action to Dz is Impatien8
bal8amina (Hagen, 1959). The biochemical action of

Dz may be interpreted by asuming that, as
Lawrence & Sturgess (1957) have suggested, pig-
ment genes -can stimulate increased production of
a common precursor; alternatively, it is possible
that there is an unlimited aamount of precursor
available but that the enzyme controlling antho-
cyanin formation is limiting.
SUMMARY
1. -Fifteen anthocyanins derived from six an-
thocyanidins have been found in flowers or leaves of
Primula sinen2i8 colour genotypes. They are 3-
glucosides, 3-glucosylglucosides or 3-glucosylglu-
cosylglucosides.
2. Five flavonol glucosides have also been
found. They are myricetin 3-glucoside and quer-
cetin and kampferol 3-glucosylglucoside and 3-
glucosylglucosylglucoside.
3. The only uncommon pigment present, sin-
ensin, has been identified as dihydrokampferol 7-
glucoside.
4. The qualitative and quantitative distribution
of these pigments in genotypes of P. sinenr8i8 is
described.
5. These results provide information about the
genetic control of the hydroxylation, methylation
and glucosidation of- the flavonoid pigments. The
biochemical effects of factors controlling co-
pigmentation and anthocyanin concentration are
discussed.
