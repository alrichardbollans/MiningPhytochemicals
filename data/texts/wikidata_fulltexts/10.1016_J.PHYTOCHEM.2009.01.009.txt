Relatively, high- andnon-symmetrical enrichment ratios at C-2 and C-6, and a lower enrichment ratio at C-7 were observed inboth SA and 2,3-DHBA detected by 13C NMR inverse gated spectrometry leading to the conclusion thatthe isochorismate pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of both compounds. However, differentenrichment ratios of the labeled carbons in SA and 2,3-DHBA indicate the use of different isochorismatepools, which means that their biosynthesis is separated in time and/or space. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionSalicylic acid (SA) is a precursor of siderophores (e.g. enterobac-tin and pyocheline) produced by microorganisms for uptake of Fe3+in an environment with highly insoluble Fe(OH)3 (Weinberg, 1978).In plants, one of the important functions of SA is as a signal com-pound for inducing systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (reviewedby Garcion and Métraux, 2006; Verberne et al., 1999). This C6C1compound is synthesized from chorismate, the end product of theshikimate pathway and a substrate for five enzymes (reviewed byMustafa and Verpoorte (2005)) leading to a diversity of secondarymetabolites in plants, for example the terpenoid indole alkaloids(reviewed by van der Heijden et al. (2004)) and the other phenolicsin Catharanthus roseus (reviewed by Mustafa and Verpoorte(2007)). Up to now there are two possible pathways known to leadto SA in living organisms. The first one is the isochorismate path-way, which converts chorismate into isochorismate by isochoris-mate synthase (ICS, EC 5.4.99.6) followed by the conversion ofisochorismate into SA by isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (IPL). Thesecond pathway for SA is the phenylalanine pathway, which longhas been thought to be the responsible pathway for SA synthesisin plants. However, the complete pathway has not been resolvedyet. In this pathway, SA is the product of hydroxylation of benzoicacid (BA) at the ortho position by benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase.ll rights reserved.: +31 71 527 4511.erpoorte).Benzoic acid is synthesized by the chain shortening of cinnamicacid either through a b-oxidative pathway or a non-oxidative path-way (reviewed by Verberne et al. (1999)).Verberne et al. (2000) postulated the presence of the isochoris-mate pathway for SA biosynthesis in plants. They successfullyoverexpressed the microbial SA pathway in tobacco. Wildermuthet al. (2001) found indirect evidence for the existence of the SAisochorismate pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Arabidopsissid2 mutant that was unable to produce chloroplast-localizedICS1 exhibited a remarkable decreased-level of SA after an infec-tion and a reduced-resistance against pathogenic fungi or bacteria.The phenylalanine pathway or the presence of another ICS genewas further proposed to be responsible for the basal level of SA(Wildermuth et al., 2001). However, Chong et al. (2001) showedthat the SA accumulation in elicited tobacco cells required de novoBA synthesis from trans-cinnamic acid, though, instead of free BA,the benzoyl–glucose was likely to be the main intermediate in theSA biosynthesis. The metabolic pathway from trans-cinnamic acidto SA via benzoic acid is also involved in the stress-induced flower-ing of Pharbitis nil (Hatayama and Takeno, 2003).In Catharanthus roseus cell suspension cultures, the levels of SA(Budi Muljono, 2001) and 2,3-DHBA increase after elicitation withfungal cell-wall preparations and are in parallel with an increased-activity of the enzyme isochorismate synthase (Moreno et al.,1994; Budi Muljono et al., 2002). A retrobiosynthetic study withC. roseus suspension cells fed with [1-13C]-D-glucose has shownthe intermediacy of isochorismate in 2,3-DHBA biosynthesis ratherN.R. Mustafa et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 532–539 533than phenylalanine (Budi Muljono et al., 2002). Hence, the pres-ence of the isochorismate pathway leading to SA in C. roseus seemsalso an alternative. In the present study, we performed a [1-13C]-D-glucose feeding experiment with a C. roseus cell suspension cul-ture, in order to identify the SA pathway employed by the cellsafter elicitation with Pythium aphanidermatum extract. The[1-13C]-D-glucose will be broken down through glycolysis or Emb-den-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway into two 3-carbon units(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/PGAL) in the cytosol leading to theprecursors of the shikimate pathway, phosphoenol-pyruvate(PEP) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) as shown in Fig. 1. Thispathway is common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However,there are also alternative pathways for converting hexoses (C6) intotrioses (C3) named the pentose-phosphate pathway and the Ent-ner-Doudoroff pathway, which are found in many organisms butcan not be considered universal (Berg et al., 2002). The (C3) pyru-vate is broken down into a (C2) acetyl-CoA (with CO2 as by-prod-uct). The acetyl-CoA is transported into mitochondria and addedonto oxaloacetate to enter the Krebs cycle for producing energy(GTP/ATP) and the enzyme co-factors NADH and FADH2, whichare needed for many other metabolic pathways including glycoly-sis. The starting and ending molecule in the Krebs cycle is oxaloac-etate, which can be converted again into pyruvate. The Krebs cycleis of central importance in all living cells that utilize oxygen (aer-obic organisms) as part of cellular respiration. Thus, the 13C isotopefrom [1-13C]-D-glucose will be incorporated in the shikimate path-way into chorismate through several routes that produce differ-ently labeled PEP and E4P.If the precursors [3-13C]PEP and [4-13C]E4P from direct glycoly-sis of the labeled glucose are predominant in the flux to the shi-kimate pathway, chorismate will be mainly labeled at C-2 (fromPEP) and C-6 (from E4P) (Rajagopalan and Jaffe, 1993) as shownin Fig. 1. As a consequence, if SA is formed via the isochorismatepathway, there will be a low labeling at the carboxyl group (C-7)and the labeling at C-2 and C-6 positions will not be equal as isoch-orismate is not symmetric.However, if SA is synthesized from the phenylalanine pathway,a high incorporation will occur in the carboxyl group (C-7) via theC-9 of chorismate, originating from C-3 of PEP (Fig. 1). Though allcarbons in the ring of chorismate will be labeled differently, thelabeling of phenylalanine at the positions C-2 and C-6 as well asat the positions C-3 and C-5 will be the same since the aromaticring of phenylalanine is symmetric along the C-1/C-4 axis (Werneret al., 1997). These pairs of carbons are chemically equivalent andthey are not distinguishable in the NMR spectra. Also, the chance ofoxidation of the ortho-positions on either side of the propane sidechain leading to SA is equal. Consequently, similar labeling at thepositions C-2 and C-6 will be found in the phenylalanine-derivedSA.These clearly different labeling patterns of SA provided by dif-ferent pathways were used in this study to identify the SA pathwayemployed by C. roseus cells.2. Results and discussionAmong four different C. roseus cell lines, the A12A2 cell suspen-sion culture grown in Murashige and Skoog (M&S) medium with-out growth hormone, was chosen for the labeling experimentsince it provided the highest level of free SA (1.0–2.5 lg/g freshweight cells) after elicitation with Pythium aphanidermatum extract(Mustafa, 2007). The cells were grown in M&S medium with a finalconcentration of 1% [1-13C]-D-glucose w/v in the medium. This le-vel of the labeled glucose is relatively high in order to minimize thepossible dilution of the labeled precursors due to the remainingnon-labeled precursors present in the cells from the previous sub-culturing. The attempt to reduce possible dilution is strongly nec-essary since the experiment deals with a plant hormone (signalingcompound), which is produced by plant cells in low amounts (ppmlevel). Moreover, final yields are affected by loss of the compoundduring the purification. The duration of feeding (5 days) before theelicitation, was aimed at increasing the biomass to produce a high-er level of labeled-SA. Budi Muljono (2001) investigated thegrowth of the C. roseus (suspension) cells and found that the max-imum of the biomass was reached on the fifth day after subcultur-ing. Concerning SA, we found the highest level of total SA in thecells 24 h after elicitation with 20 ml Pythium extract comparedwith cells 48 h after elicitation, suggesting that the catabolism ofSA 48 h after elicitation is higher than de novo biosynthesis.Three independent labeling experiments were performed onbatches of the A12A2 cell suspension cultures. Each batch con-tained 9–10 Erlenmeyer-flasks of 100 ml cell culture, which pro-vided around 6–9 g dry weight cell material (about 4–5% of thefresh weight cells). Aqueous methanol (90%, v/v) was used to ex-tract the dried material and the purification of SA from the extractswas performed using the method previously described by Verberneet al. (2002) subsequently followed by an ion exchange chromatog-raphy (IEC) method described by Mustafa et al. (2008). The levels offree SA were determined by HPLC (Verberne et al., 2002) in theMeOH–water extracts (obtained from the first step of the extractionprotocol), in the fractions obtained from the IEC and from the sec-ond purification using a Sephadex LH-20 column (Table 1). Thedetermination of the free SA level of batch 3 before IEC was carriedout in the MeOH–water extract collected from 48 h maceration (to-tal 165 lg). By continuing maceration with a fresh volume of MeOH90% v/v until 96 h, the amount of total free SA extracted increased.Some SA (56 lg) was lost most probably in the process before thepurification with gel exclusion chromatography. In the 1H NMRspectra of the extract obtained from the purification using IEC wecould detect the SA resonances quite well among the signals ofsome remaining impurities (e.g. 2,3-DHBA). However, in the 2DNMR spectra (HMQC, HMBC and J-Resolved) of this extract the SAsignals were not as pronounced, suggesting the need of a secondpurification step before 13C NMR analysis. For this, Sephadex LH-20 resin was used since its separation mechanism is not only basedon the size/molecular weight (MW) of the compounds in the extractbut also on adsorption, in which different polarities of compoundswith almost similar molecular weight (e.g. different in one hydroxylgroup) can result in different retention. Besides, this method pro-vides a good recovery (almost 100%). Elution with 300 ml of 100%MeOH to the (IEC-purified) extract of the first batch provided 30fractions (each 10 ml), in which the fraction number 11 and 12 con-tained 109 lg and 48 lg SA, respectively. The inverse gated 13CNMR method was chosen to analyze fraction-11. The sample wasmeasured twice using this method, and it was also measured onceusing broadband decoupling. All gave similar results. Fig. 2A showsthe inverse gated 13C NMR spectra of fraction-11 of batch 1. Due tothe lower level of SA and the level of impurities (detected by 1HNMR), the fraction no 12 (of batch 1 and batch 3) were not analyzedfurther. Also, batch 2 that provided only around 66 lg of free SA (asdetected before purification) was not analyzed. An inverse gated 13CNMR analysis was also performed on the fraction-11 of batch 3 con-taining around 85 lg SA (Fig. 2B), however, the noise-level washigher than that of the batch 1 and therefore was only used for asemi-quantitative analysis (see below).The SA signals in the 13C NMR spectra of the enriched sampleswere identified by comparison with those of the SA reference com-pound (Fig. 2C), assigned according to Scott (1972), and confirmedby the J-resolved 1H NMR spectra of the enriched SA batch 1(supplementary figure 1A) and SA standard (supplementary figure1B) and the HMBC spectrum of batch 1 (supplementary figure 2).The inverse gated decoupling spectral data was used for the413 2*[4-13C]-Erythrose-4-phosphateOOHOHP-Ot-CinnamateP**E/PE/P*OO[1-13C]Glucose1OOHOHOHHO OH*6[1-13C]- or [6-13C]Fructose-1:6-bis-P1 6OHOHOHOP-OO-P***312[3-13C]-PhosphoenolpyruvateOOHP-O3 12[3-13C]-3-P-GlyceraldehydeOHOHP-O*Dihydroxyacetone-POHOO-P123*[6,7-13C]-3-Deoxy-D arabinoheptulosonate-7-P6412357*E*POOHOHPOOOOHOHOHOOHOH[2,6-13C]ShikimateE* *P*POOHOOHOOH[2,6,9-13C]ChorismateE*8421765 3910*P E*[2,6,9-13C]IsochorismateOOHOOHOHO*P*P6 2OOHOH7E* *P[2,6-13C]Salicylic acid PrephenateOOHOHOOO1 265 3849710E* *PP*L-PhenylalanineOOHNH3+P**E/PE/P*6OOHBenzoic acid27*E/PE/P*P*?PALBA2HICSIPL[2,6,7-13C]Salicylic acidE/P*OOHOH7*E/P6 2P*CM[O]OHOHOH O6 2E* *P7[2,6-13C] 2,3-Dihydroxy-benzoic acidFig. 1.

In this case b isthe C-7 peak height. Enrichment ratio is obtained by normalizingan X/Y with the lowest X/Y value. For SA these data are shown inTable 2.2,3-DHBA was extracted with EtOAc from the medium of batch1 in acidic condition (pH 4). In the aromatic region of the 1H NMR-and 13C NMR spectra of this non-purified ethyl-acetate extract, 2,3-DHBA appeared as the major compound. The signals were com-pared with those of 2,3-DHBA standard (supplementary figure 3& Fig. 3). The carbon-signals were assigned as reported by Scott(1972) and the intensity was measured based on peak height.The enrichment ratios of the 2,3-DHBA signals are shown in Table3. The results show that relatively high- and non-symmetricalenrichment ratios occur at C-2 and C-6, and a lower enrichment ra-tio at C-7 of SA and 2,3-DHBA pointing to the isochorismate path-way as the responsible pathway for both compounds. In case of thephenylpropanoid pathway, the 2 and 6 positions become equiva-lent in phenylalanine resulting in a 1:1 ratio for labeling in thosepositions (Werner et al., 1997). In the isochorismate pathway thosetwo carbons still are directly related to their respective precursors,and thus are likely to have different incorporation levels. Asymme-try of the labeling of C-2 and C-6 is thus evidence for the isochoris-mate pathway. The analyses of SA of the batch 3 spectra were inagreement with this conclusion.The precursors of isochorismate are part of a large metabolicnetwork, in which the label can be moved to almost any position(as an illustration, see supplementary figure 4). For example, bothPEP and E4P can be synthesized from glyceraldehyde-3-P (3PGAL)through glycolysis/EMP pathway and the Pentose Phosphate–Ent-ner-Doudoroff pathway (PP–ED pathway). Gluconeogenesis canmove the label from C-1 to C-6 of glucose. Both different labeledglucoses can enter the oxidative- and/or non-oxidative PP–EDpathway resulting in labeled- and/or non-labeled 3PGAL and pyru-vate. PEP alone can be produced from oxaloacetate through theKrebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is the second step in carbohydratemetabolism employing acetyl-CoA, which derives from pyruvatethrough glycolysis and PP–ED pathway. However, acetyl-CoAmay also derive from amino acids through protein catabolismand/or from b-oxidation of fatty acids in fat catabolism. Dependingon the activity of those pathways (the flux), the ratio of the differ-ently labeled precursors entering the shikimate pathway will bedifferent through time. If SA and 2,3-DHBA are synthesized usingthe same isochorismate pool at the same time and place, both com-pounds are expected to have the same labeling pattern. Tables 2and 3 show that the highest incorporation occurred at C-2 and C-6 (of SA and 2,3-DHBA), which originate from [3-13C]PEP and[4-13C]E4P. However, the enrichment ratios of those carbons ofSA are higher than of 2,3-DHBA. It seemed that glycolysis employ-ing [1-13C]glucose was probably the main pathway of the precur-sors for SA and as the time went on, scrambling of label occurredthrough other pathways e.g. gluconeogenesis, the Krebs cycle andliberation of glucose from non-labeled storage carbohydratesresulting in relative lower enrichment ratios of C-2 and C-6 of2,3-DHBA. Many studies showed that an elicitation (a stress factor)increases the free-sugars levels in the cells. The metabolite profil-ing of SA-treated cells (Mustafa, 2007) showed that the elicitationwith SA results in an immediate increase of glucose levels, indicat-ing to a major change in the fluxes through the primary metabo-lites pathways. The label at C-1 of SA or 2,3-DHBA must originatefrom [2-13C]PEP. This labeled-PEP can be formed through the Krebscycle. [3-13C]Pyruvate can be decarboxylated leading to carbon-dioxyde and [2-13C]acetyl-CoA, the latter can be attached to oxalo-acetate (entering the Krebs cycle) to produce citrate. In the Krebscycle, the fumarase oxidizes fumarate into malate, subsequentlymalate dehydrogenase converts malate into oxaloacetate, the lat-ter can be decarboxylated resulting in [3-13C]PEP and/or[2-13C]PEP (the chance is 50% each) from only one turn of the cycle.If the isochorismate pathway was the main pathway used for SAand 2,3-DHBA, the labeling at C-7 should be from [1-13C]PEP,N.R. Mustafa et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 532–539 537which can also be obtained from the Krebs cycle. The intermediatesfumarate, malate and oxaloacetate will be labeled at the C-termi-nal side after the third-time entering the Krebs cycle, thus produc-ing [1-13C]PEP. The chance of the labeled-carboxyl groupremaining in PEP by decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is 50%, whichis determined by the position of the keto group (as the result of theoxidation by fumarase) next to the labeled-carboxyl group. Thus,both C-1 and C-2 of PEP may be labeled. The labeling is likely to in-crease through time, with other words compounds formed directlyfrom glucose after elicitation will have a relatively high level ofincorporation at C-2, C-6 and in case of the phenylalanine pathwayat C-7, whereas compounds formed later may have increasedincorporation levels at C-1 and in case of isochorismate pathwayat C-7, and thus the relative incorporation of all carbons C-1, C-2,C-6 and C-7 will be less.A high resolution mass spectrometry analysis was also appliedon the purified enriched SA extract- and enriched 2,3-DHBA extractof batch 1 (supplementary figure 5). The result shows that the[M+2]+ fractions of both extracts were higher than those of thestandards. All of the labeled fractions detected {[M+1]+ until[M+4]+} of enriched SA were in higher levels than those of enriched2,3-DHBA. These results support the NMR results (the enrichmentratios of carbon atoms of SA and 2,3-DHBA), suggesting that dilu-tion of label occurred more intensively at the time when 2,3-DHBAwas synthesized than that of SA. Using the enrichment ratio of eachcarbon as determined by 13C NMR and the total overall percentageof labeled carbon from ratio [M+1]+ until [M+4]+ the abundance (%)of label at each carbon position of SA and 2,3-DHBA can be calcu-lated (Tables 2 and 3).The different labeling pattern of SA and 2,3-DHBA and the re-sults of the mass spectrometry analysis may also explain the differ-ent levels of the compounds in a time course after elicitation. Inour previous studies (Budi Muljono, 2001), we found that SA bio-synthesis started earlier than 2,3-DHBA after elicitation, probablybecause SA is a signal compound in SAR/plant defense responseamong others resulting in the production of defense compoundssuch as 2,3-DHBA. Free SA and free 2,3-DHBA levels were alwayshigher than the corresponding glucosides at every observation.Free SA was detected in a range of 0–325 ng/g fresh weight (FW)cells, whereas free 2,3-DHBA was found in a range of 0–200 lg/gFW cells (more or less 1000-fold higher than of SA level). The high-est increase in SA level (from about 50 ng to 200 ng/g FW cells)occurred during 4–8 h after elicitation, whilst in the case of 2,3-DHBA this occurred at 16–20 h after elicitation (from about70 lg to 150 lg/g FW cells). The 2,3-DHBA produced in elicitedC. roseus cells was released into the medium. The pool of precur-sors from which most of 2,3-DHBA is produced is thus differentthan for SA. Besides the different time of biosynthesis, compart-mentation on the level of cellular compartments or cells can notbe excluded.3. ConclusionThe labeling results found lead to the following conclusions: (1)The isochorismate pathway is responsible for the production of SAand 2,3-DHBA in C. roseus cell cultures elicited by Pythium aphan-idermatum extract, (2) The different enrichment ratios of the car-bons in SA and 2,3-DHBA mean that they are not produced fromthe same isochorismate pool, which means that their biosynthesisis separated in time and/or space. In fact we are dealing with thefour dimensions of a dynamic biological system. To elucidate theregulation we need at least to measure more points in time to beable to get insight in the fluxes through the pathways. The threedimensions of space, i.e. the compartmentation, are much moredifficult to deal with as it requires separation of cell types and/orcell organelles, followed by analysis sufficiently sensitive to mea-sure the compounds of interest. Developing fluxomics will thusbe the major challenge.4. Experimental4.1. Plant cell culturesCatharanthus roseus cell suspension cultures line A12A2 wasprovided from Delft University in 1995. Maintenance has been per-formed weekly and the cell line was also cryopreserved in our lab-oratory. This cell line was grown previously in Murashige andSkoog (M&S) medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing3% sucrose, but then adapted in M&S medium without growth hor-mones supplemented with 2% of D(+)-monohydrate glucose as thecarbon source for labeling purpose. The yellowish green A12A2cells were grown in 250 ml-Erlenmeyer-flasks each containing100 ml medium and cultivated at 24 (±1) C under continuous light(500–1500 lux), on a shaker at 100 rpm. The suspension cultureswith labeled glucose was obtained by subculturing on the M&Smedium containing no growth hormone supplemented with 2%of [1-13C]-D(+)glucose.4.2. ElicitorPythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzpatrick CBS 313.33 wasused as an elicitor. This fungus was maintained on malt extractagar medium, at 25 C, in the dark and subcultured every week.Aseptically, the solid culture was cut to pieces. Two pieces (eachabout 1 cm2) were transferred into a 250 ml-Erlenmeyer-flask con-taining 100 ml M&S liquid medium without growth hormone andsupplemented with 3% sucrose. This culture was cultivated at27 C on a shaker at 100 rpm for 7 days, sterilized in an autoclave(120 C, 20 min) and subsequently filtered to separate extract frombroken mycelia under aseptic conditions. All experiments wereperformed with the same batch of filtrate.4.3. Elicitation and harvesting cellsAbout 20 ml of the Pythium extract was added to 100 ml of the5-days old C. roseus suspension cells grown in labeled glucosemedium. The cultivation conditions for the treated cultures werethe same as that for plant cell culture maintenance. The elicitedcells were harvested 24 h after treatment by vacuum filtrationusing a P2 glass filter to separate the cells from the medium. Thecells were rinsed on the filter with de-ionized water, collected, fro-zen in liquid nitrogen and freeze–dried for 72 h before extractionwith MeOH 90%.4.4.

Gly-cine (99.7%) and nicotinic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Merck.D(+)-glucose (>99.0%) was obtained from Fluka Chemie (Buchs,Germany) whereas [1-13C]-D-glucose (>99%, with >99% atom1-13C) was from Campro Scientific (Veenendaal, The Netherlands).Fig. 3. 13C NMR inverse gated spectra (CH3OH-d4) of medium containing enriched 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid of batch 1 of Catharanthus roseus suspension cultures elicited byPythium (a) and of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid reference compound (b, 10 mg/ml).538 N.R. Mustafa et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 532–539myo-Inositol (>99.0%) was from Duchefa Biochemie (Haarlem, TheNetherlands). Pyridoxine–HCl was from Sigma–Aldrich Chemie(Steinheim, Germany) and thiamine-di-HCl was from Janssen Chi-mica (Geel, Belgium).4.5. Chemicals used for extraction, purification and analysis of salicylicacidDowex 1WX2 (100 mesh) and salicylic acid were purchasedfrom Sigma–Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetonitrile (>99.8%),ethyl-acetate (>99.8%) and methanol (>99.8%) were from BiosolveB.V. (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Acetic acid (100%), ammo-nia, n-hexane (>99%) and hydrochloric acid (36–38%) were pur-chased from Mallinckrodt Baker B.V. (Deventer, The Netherlands).di-Sodiumhydrogenphosphate 2-hydrate (99%), ortho-phosphoricacid (85%) and trichloroacetic acid (>99.5%) were obtained fromMerck. Sodium hydroxide (>99%) was from Boom (Meppel, TheNetherlands). CH3OH-d4 was from C.E. Saclay (Gif-Sur-Yvette,France).4.6. 2,3-DHBA extractionThe method previously described by Budi Muljono et al. (2002)was used for 2,3-DHBA extraction. Eight hundred ml of mediumharvested from the 1st batch of labeling experiments was acidifiedwith phosphoric acid (85%) to obtain a pH 4.0 and subsequently ex-tracted with 800 ml of ethyl-acetate, twice. The ethyl-acetatephases were pooled, rinsed with the same volume of de-ionizedwater, sodium-sulphate was added to remove the residual waterand the ethyl-acetate was evaporated using a vacuum rotary evap-orator at room temperature till dryness. The dried extract wasre-dissolved in 1 ml of CH3OH-d4 for NMR analysis.4.7. Salicylic acid extractionTwenty-four hours-elicited cells of C. roseus A12A2, harvestedfrom 9 or 10 Erlenmeyer-flasks (each containing 100 ml) of cellsuspension culture, were transferred to the same number of50 ml-tubes and freeze–dried for 72 h. About 25 ml of 90% MeOHwas added to the dried material in each tube followed by vor-texing, sonication (20 min) and maceration (24 h). The mixturewas then centrifuged (at 2500 rpm, 15 C, 10 min) using a Varifuge3.0 R (Heraeus Sepatech, Germany) and the supernatant was col-lected. The pellet was extracted again using 20 ml of 100% MeOHfollowed by vortexing, sonication (20 min) and maceration(24 h). The mixture was centrifuged: the supernatant from thissecond maceration was combined with the first one, adjusted toa volume of 35–45 ml/tube from which a sample was taken todetermine the SA level by HPLC. All of the MeOH–water extractswere pooled and the extraction of SA was performed using themethod described by Verberne et al. (2002). One ml of 0.2 N NaOHwas added into the MeOH–water extract and the solvent was evap-orated to almost dry, using a vacuum rotary evaporator at a tem-perature maximum of 40 C. To the concentrated extract (about1 ml) 10–15 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added result-ing in pH 1.0–1.5 and subsequently partitioned with 3  10 ml ofn-hexane – EtOAc (1:1). The non-polar phase (containing free SA)was collected. To the TCA fraction subsequently 5 ml of 8 N HClwas added (resulting in pH 0) and placed in a water-bath (at80 C, 1 h) to hydrolyze the SA-glucoside. The liberated SA was ex-tracted with 3  15 ml of n-hexane - EtOAc (1:1). Both non-polarextracts containing SA were evaporated separately using a vacuumrotary evaporator at room temperature till dryness. Each extractwas re-dissolved in 2 ml of 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0–7.5) containing 10–20% MeOH before application to an ion ex-change chromatography (IEC) column.4.8. HPLC-fluorescence analysisHPLC analysis of SA was performed based on the system de-scribed by Verberne et al. (2002) with a modification in the HPLCbuffer. The column, a Phenomenex column type LUNA 3 l C18(2) 150  4.60 mm equipped with a Security Guard from Phenom-enex (Torrance, CA, USA) was used. The mobile phase, 0.2 MN.R. Mustafa et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 532–539 539ammonium acetate buffer in 10% MeOH (pH 5.5), was pumpedusing an LKB 2150 HPLC pump (Bromma, Sweden), at a flow rateof 0.80 ml/min. The injection (20 ll) of the samples was performedusing a Gilson 234 auto-injector (Villiers Le Bel, France). The detec-tion was carried out using a Shimadzu RF-10AxL spectrofluoromet-ric detector (Tokyo, Japan), at an emission wavelength of 407 nmand an excitation wavelength of 305 nm, which was connected toa CR 501 Chromatopac printer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A rangeof concentrations of SA standard was used for every set of quanti-tative measurements. The SA peak appears at around 11 min.4.9. Purification using ion exchange chromatographyPurification of SA by ion exchange chromatography was per-formed based on the system described by Mustafa et al. (2008).The free SA extract or extract obtained from the acid hydrolysiswas dissolved in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0–7.5)containing 10–20% MeOH and applied onto the column containing(2.5 - 4.0 g) Dowex 1WX2, 100 mesh (Sigma–Aldrich). Three hun-dred ml of 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0–7.5) wereused as the washing buffer to separate SA from most of the impu-rities, resulting in 30 fractions. To recover SA from the resin, 100 mlof 0.3 M HCl in 60% acetonitrile (resulting in 10 fractions) wereused as the counter ion solution. Samples were taken out fromthe washing fractions and from the acidic fractions for HPLC anal-ysis. The acidic fractions containing a relatively high amount of SAwere pooled and evaporated. Subsequently, partitioning with4  10 ml of n-hexane - EtOAc (1:1) was performed with theremaining acidic-aqueous part. The non-polar fractions werepooled, evaporated in a vacuum rotary evaporator at room temper-ature till dryness, and re-dissolved in 1 ml of MeOH.4.10. Purification using gel exclusion chromatographyAbout 30 g of Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala,Sweden) were suspended in 100% MeOH and subsequently put intoa glass column with a diameter of 2 cm. The length of the columnpacked with the stationary phase was 33.5 cm. The stationaryphase was rinsed with 200 ml of (degassed) 100% MeOH beforeapplication of the extract. An IEC-purified extract (in 1 ml ofMeOH) was applied on the column and fractionated (each 10 ml)using 300 ml of (degassed) 100% MeOH. Samples were taken fromthe fractions and analyzed by HPLC. The fraction containing SA wasevaporated and re-dissolved in 1 ml of CH3OH-d4 for NMR analysis.4.11. NMR analysis1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CH3OH-d4 using aBruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer, whilst the HMBC and J-re-solved 1H NMR spectra were recorded in CH3OH-d4 by a BrukerAV 500 MHz spectrometer. For inverse gated 13C NMR analysis ofenriched SA and 2,3-DHBA, 36,864 scans were recorded with thefollowing parameters: pulse width (30, 13.0 ls), DS = 4,DW = 13.9 ls, AQ = 1 s and relaxation delay (Dl) = 2.0 s. FIDs wereFourier transformed with LB = 2.20 Hz and SI = 128 kHz.4.12. Mass spectrometry analysisMass spectra were measured on a LTQ–FT Hybrid mass spec-trometer (Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA). Spectra were measuredin ESI mode, with a source temperature of 275 C, source voltageof 4 kV and a sheatgas of 35. Chromatograms were recorded inLTQ iontrap SIM mode with a scan range of 127.2 to 147.2 m/zfor SA and a scan range of 143.1 to 163.1 m/z for 2,3-DHBA. Sali-cylic acid and 2,3-DHBA were dissolved in 90% MeOH and 10%H2O and directly infused with 10 ll/min. Accurate masses weredetermined under the same conditions but in FT SIM mode.Appendix A.
