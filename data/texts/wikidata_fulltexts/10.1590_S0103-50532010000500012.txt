A análise multivariada da composição química dos óleos essenciais das folhas de Eugenia 
uniflora com diferentes cores de fruto indicou a presença de três grupos de óleos em relação ao 
biótipo do fruto das amostras. O primeiro grupo incluiu amostras de frutos amarelos, vermelhos 
escuros e roxos contendo altas percentagens de germacreno B (11,1-30,7%), germacrona (9,8-54%) 
e atractilona (0-19,9%). No grupo II, com amostras de frutos vermelhos claro, os constituintes 
majoritários foram o curzereno (42,0-43,2%), germacreno D (8,7-9,0%) e germacreno A (5,9-8,9%), 
enquanto que o grupo III incluiu amostras com frutos vermelho-alaranjado, caracterizadas por um 
alto conteúdo de selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-ona (40,3-55,4%) e epóxido de selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-
8-ona (12,7-24,4%). Os óleos essenciais foram investigados frente ao fungo Paracoccidioides 
brasiliensis pela técnica de macrodiluição em caldo. O resultado mais significativo foi obtido com 
o óleo do grupo II, com a forma leveduriforme de P. brasiliensis sendo inibida completamente na 
concentração de 62,5 mg mL-1. 
The multivariate chemical analysis of essential oils of Eugenia uniflora leaves with different 
fruit colours indicated the presence of three oil clusters regarding sample biotypes. The first 
cluster included yellowish, dark red and purple fruits with high percentages of germacrene B 
(11.1-30.7%), germacrone (9.8-54%) and atractylone (0-19.9%). In cluster II, with bright red 
fruit samples, the major constituents were curzerene (42.0-43.2%), germacrene D (8.7-9.0%) and 
germacrene A (5.9-8.9%), whereas cluster III included red-orange fruit samples containing high 
contents of selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (40.3-55.4%) and selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one epoxide 
(12.7-24.4%). The clustered oils were investigated against the systemic fungus Paracoccidioides 
brasiliensis via the broth macrodilution method. The oil from cluster II revealed the most 
significant result. The yeast form of P. brasiliensis was completely inhibited at a concentration 
of 62.5 mg mL-1.

Introduction
Fungal infections are common in tropical countries and 
may have a major impact on public health. Whereas the 
dermatophyte fungi group is of common occurrence,1 the 
incidence of systemic infections due to Paracoccidioides 
brasiliensis (Splendore) Almeida has increased in the 
last two decades.2 P. brasiliensis is an etiological agent 
of paracoccidioidomycosis, the most prevalent human 
systemic mycosis in Latin America, where up to 10 
million individuals are estimated to be infected.3 This 
thermally dimorphic fungus grows as a filamentous saprobe 
(mycelium) in the soil at 25 °C and as a multicelular parasitic 
form (yeast) in the host. The shift from the mycelial to the 
yeast form (36 °C) is crucial for the infection of the human 
host. The heat shock response of P. brasiliensis to an abrupt 
increase in environmental temperature during infection 
results in the expression of the heat shock protein family 
of 60 (HSP60) and 70 kDa (HSP70).4 HSPs are regarded 
as suitable targets for antimicrobial drug development.5
Influence of Fruit Biotypes on the Chemical Composition and Antifungal Activity J. Braz. Chem. Soc.852
A previous phytochemical study of Eugenia uniflora L. 
(Myrtaceae) leaves has identified that macrocyclic ellagitannin 
dimmer oenothein B is responsible for the inhibition of 
HSP60 and (1,3)-b-glucan synthase (Pbfks1) transcript of 
P. brasiliensis.6 In addition, the yeast phase was inhibited by 
non-polar fractions of the leaf ethanolic extract constituted 
by terpenoids, mainly oxygenated sesquiterpenes.7 Curzerene 
(isofuranegermacrene), germacrene B and atractylone 
were the major constituents, all previously identified in the 
essential oils of E. uniflora and probably responsible for the 
antifungal activity.8-12 E. uniflora leaves have been used in 
folk medicine for the treatment of diarrhoea,13 hyperglycemia, 
hyperlipidemia and hypertension.14 Furthermore, they have 
been used as an antimalarial and spasmolytic agent as well 
as enzyme inhibitors.15-17 Antimicrobial activities have also 
been reported for leaf essential oils against bacterial and 
dermatophyte isolates.18
The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical 
constituents of the essential oils from E. uniflora leaves 
with different fruit colour biotypes, in order to provide 
evidence for the existence of varieties of this species and 
to investigate whether these biotypes/chemotypes express a 
similar antifungal activity against P. brasiliensis. Essential 
oils from mature leaves of representative populations 
with yellowish, red (bright red, red-orange and dark red) 
and purple fruit colours were analyzed by GC-MS. To 
study chemical variability, chemical constituents were 
submitted to multivariate analysis to detect the pattern 
distribution of samples and to identify which constituents 
are able to distinguish between these groups of individuals. 
Representative clustered oils were submitted to an antifungal 
susceptibility assay with the yeast form of P. brasiliensis 
via the standard broth macrodilution method, according to 
the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard.
Results and Discussion
Fruit colour variations are well known in E. uniflora, 
although varieties according to fruit colour biotypes are not 
easily definable.19 Previous studies have mainly focused on 
the essential oils of leaves and only a few have investigated 
oils extracted from fruits.8-12,20-22 The description of the colour 
of sampled fruits is frequently excluded from these studies.11 
According to a recent study, the essential oil of two fruit 
colour biotypes from both leaves and fruits of E. brasiliensis 
Lam. may indicate the presence of the two chemotypes of 
this species.23 
In this study, E. uniflora leaf essential oils were obtained 
from species with three main fruit colour biotypes: yellowish, 
red (bright red, red-orange and dark red) and purple.24 
A total of 36 compounds were identified, accounting for 
91.3-94.6% of volatile constituents (Table 1). The essential 
oils predominantly contained a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon 
composition, even though the oxygenated sesquiterpene 
content for some samples was over 75.5%. Essential oils from 
E. uniflora have showed that, although the main constituent 
may vary, sesquiterpenes are usually the dominant class.8-12,22 
Nevertheless, leaf oils from plants growing in Argentina 
whose main constituents were the monoterpenes pulegone, 
carvone and limonene and the sesquiterpene nerolidol have 
been described.20
Results obtained from PCA (18 samples × 12 variables = 
216 data) and nearest neighbour complete linkage cluster 
analysis using Ward’s technique revealed high chemical 
variability between leaf essential oil biotypes. Figure 1 
shows the relative position of the individuals to an axial 
system originated in the PCA. The first PC accounts for 
53.1% of total variance and discriminates well above the 
99% confidence level the oxygenated sesquiterpenes of red-
orange fruit colour samples from other biotypes. The second 
PC discriminates (p < 0.0001) bright red fruit samples by 
their high sesquiterpene hydrocarbon content. 
Therefore, three types of leaf essential oils were found: 
cluster I (samples with yellowish, dark red and purple fruit 
colours) was characterised (p < 0.015) by a high percentage 
of germacrene B (21.6 ± 7.2%), atractylone (11.7 ± 5.3%), 
germacrone (17.3 ± 13.2%) and b-caryophyllene (8.7 ± 
3.7%); cluster II (samples with bright red fruit colour) 
had curzerene (42.6 ± 0.9%), germacrene D (8.8 ± 0.1%),

germacrene A (7.4 ± 1.5%) and b-elemene (4.4 ± 0.1%) as 
principal constituents (p < 0.003); and cluster III (samples 
with red-orange fruit biotypes) contained high amounts 
(p < 0.029) of selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (48.2 ± 5.7%), 
selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one epoxide (19.3 ± 4.3%), 
spathulenol (4.1 ± 5.0%) and d-selinene (3.3 ± 2.9%). 
Single Ion Monitoring (SIM) GC-MS analysis indicated that 
samples from clusters I and II did not show selina-1,3,7(11)-
trien-8-one or their epoxide derivative, whereas samples from 
cluster III detected curzerene, germacrene B and atractylone. 
The latter was also verified in cluster II samples by the 
CG-MS-SIM technique. All similarities between sampled 
oil constituents are shown in the dendrogram of Figure 2. 
In order to assimilate the overall trend in volatile 
leaf oils and to reduce the uncontrolled factors affecting 
quantitative variations, the constituent data were also 
coded as independent single characters (either present or 
absent), as recommended by Sneath and Sokal.25 Multiple 
Correspondence Analyses revealed a similar chemical

distinction between the biotypes sampled.26 Clusters I and 
II were clustered and cluster III was split based on up and 
down samples in relation to the second PC origin, as shown 
in Figure 1 (data not shown).
The canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) confirmed 
the clustering as a priori groupings. Furthermore, an axial 
system that originated in the CDA discriminated well 
above the 99% confidence level the three types of essential 
oils based only on the contents of curzerene and selina-
1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one as predictor variables (Table 2). The 
first discriminant function (F1) accounts for ca. 97% of 
total variability and separates cluster III from clusters I/II 
(F-test value = 104.07; degrees of freedom, DF = 4 and 28; 
p < 0.0001), due to the high content of selina-1,3,7(11)-
trien-8-one. On the other hand, the second discriminant 
function (F2) distinguishes cluster II from I as a result of the 
high content of curzerene (F = 37.07; DF = 1 and 15; p < 
0.0001). In addition, the two discriminant functions allow an 
accurate prediction of total well-classification in the original 
clusters via cross-validation or Jackknife approaches. These 
approaches consider a slightly reduced number of samples 
from the parent data set, estimate parameters for each of 
these modified data sets, and then calculate the accuracy of 
the predictions for the samples previously removed by the 
resulting models.27
Similarly to a previous study which analyzed essential 
leaf oils of purple and yellow fruits of E. brasiliensis,23 our 
results may confirm the presence of varieties/chemotypes 
for E. uniflora due to the remarkable difference in chemical 
composition according to fruit colour biotypes. In fact, the 
literature combined with our findings led us to deduce that 
the chemotype growing in the Brazilian Northeast and in 
Nigeria, which exhibited selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one and 
selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one epoxide (cluster III), is probably 
the most common orange-red fruit biotype in this region.9,11 In 
recent study,28 the chemical polymorphism in leaf oils of this 
chemotype revealed to be environmentally determined by a 
clear seasonal influence. Two other essential oil chemotypes 
of the plant have been reported: the chemotype growing in 
the south of Brazil, which contained a- and b-selinene and 
nerolidol,21 and the chemotype growing in Argentina, whose 
main constituents were monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene 
nerolidol.20 These chemical data could be confirmed by genetic 
studies based on nuclear and chloroplastic DNA markers. 
These studies indicate that a more restricted gene flow may 
exist between E. uniflora populations from the Brazilian South, 
Northeast and Southeast.29
The chemical oil composition from the Brazilian Northern 
sampling site is similar to that of cluster II,10 although 
the content of germacrene B was higher than that of our 
samples. In addition, the abundance of curzerene (20.5%), 
germacrene B (21.6%), atractylone (11.7%) and germacrone 
(17.3%) in our samples (cluster I) showed a marked deviation 
from previous leaf oil investigations, despite the fact that this 
study has described higher contents of curzerene (50.2%);12 
curzerene (19.7%), atractylone (16.9%) and selina-1,3,7(11)-
trien-8-one (17.8%);11 curzerene (30%), germacrene B 
(15.6%) and germacrone (32.8%);10 curzerene (24%), selina-
1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (17%), selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one 
epoxide (14%),8 and selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (48.5%).30 
Furthermore, oil constituents such as pulegone, carvone, 
a-selinene and nerolidol, typical in other studies, were not 
detected in our oil samples.20 This variation pattern in the leaf 
essential oil suggests that the observed chemical variations 
may be a result of the existence of new chemotypes for E. 
uniflora associated to yellowish, dark red and purple fruit 
colour biotypes. 
Representative clustered oils were investigated against 
a P. brasiliensis reference strain (ATCC 90659) and three 
clinical isolates (Pb65, Pb1578 and Pb8334) via the standard 
broth macrodilution method, following NCCL M27-A2 
guidelines with modifications.31 Based on MIC and MFC

values (Table 3), the most significant finding was obtained 
with the oil from cluster II. The yeast form of P. brasiliensis 
was completely inhibited at a concentration of 62.5 mg mL-1, 
whereas oils from clusters III and I exhibited MIC values of 
250 and 500 mg mL-1, respectively. MIC values were similar 
against various isolates and in relation to those non-polar 
fractions of the previously reported leaf ethanolic extract.7 
All three oils readily killed P. brasiliensis isolates, although 
the oil from cluster II had the lowest MFC. These results may 
be associated to curzerene and germacrone in cluster II. On 
the other hand, the inhibitions and fungicidal activities of 
oils from clusters III and I may be related to selinatrienone 
derivatives and curzerene, respectively. Curzerene is 
structurally related to atractylone, which has shown an 
antiproliferative effect on tumour cell lines.32 Its derivative, 
atractylenolide III, inhibited the synthesis of mammal heat 
shock proteins HSP60 and HSP27 kDa family and enhances 
the effect of chemotherapy.33 Germacrone and curzerene have 
been described as active phytoconstituents in rizhome oils 
from Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc. (Zingiberaceae).34
Conclusions
The essential oil from E. uniflora leaves grown in the 
Central Brazilian Cerrado revealed a high polymorphism 
which might be influenced by fruit colour biotypes. 
Therefore, caution is required in all chemical and biological 
investigations of Eugenia oils because of such influence. In 
addition, E. uniflora essential oils showed very promising 
results in the antifungal assay against the systemic fungus 
P. brasiliensis and warrant further study.
Experimental
Plant material
E. uniflora leaves in the vegetative phenophase were 
collected in June 2002 and 2003 and from June to August 
2007 in the vicinities of Goiânia (S 16° 35’ 14”; W 49° 17’ 
40”; 736 m; four red fruit specimens), Santo Antônio de 
Goiás (S 16° 30’; W 49° 19’; 773 m; two yellowish and two 
purple specimens), Nova Veneza (S 16° 21’ 44”; W 49° 18’ 
39”; 773 m; eight red fruit specimens) and Anápolis (S 16° 
20’ 13”; W 48° 56’ 19”; 1034 m; two red fruit specimens), 
Goiás State, Brazil. Leaves from red fruit specimens were 
also separated in bright red (two samples), red-orange (five 
samples) and dark red (seven samples) biotypes. Fruit colour 
biotypes were based when the fruits were completely ripe. 
Specimens were identified by Professor Heleno Dias Ferreira 
of the Department of Biology of Universidade Federal de 
Goiás (UFG), Goiás State, Brazil. A voucher specimen is 
deposited at UFG’s herbarium (code number 25477). 
To assess the chemical oil composition, the leaves were 
dried at room temperature for 7 days at 30 °C until constant 
weight. After having been powdered, the dried phytomass 
(10-50 g) of each sample was submitted to hydrodistillation 
(2 h) using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus. At the end 
of each distillation the oils were collected and dried with 
anhydrous Na2SO4, transferred to glass flasks and kept at 
a temperature of -18 °C. Oil yields (%) were based on the 
dried weight of plant samples. 
Chemical analysis
Oil sample analyses were performed on a GC-MS 
Shimadzu QP5050A instrument under the following 
conditions: a CBP-5 (Shimadzu) fused silica capillary 
column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) 
connected to a quadrupole detector operating in the EI mode 
at 70 eV with a scan mass range of 40-400 m/z at a sampling 
rate of 1.0 scan s-1; carrier gas: He (1 mL min-1); injector and 
interface temperatures of 220 °C and 240 °C, respectively, 
with a split ratio of 1:20. The injection volume was 0.4 mL 
(20% in hexane) and the oven temperature was raised 
from 60 to 246 °C, with an increase of 3 °C min-1, then of 
10 °C min-1 to 270 °C, holding the final temperature for 
5 min. Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) was performed in the 
same conditions of the scan analyses. Individual components 
were identified by comparing their linear retention indexes 
(Rl),35 by co-injection with a C8-C32 n-alkanes series,36 mass 
spectra with those of the literature,35 and computerised 
MS-database using NIST libraries.35

France (2002). Cluster analysis was also applied to the study 
of sample similarity on the basis of essential oil constituent 
distribution. Nearest neighbour complete linkage technique 
by Benzécri algorithm was used as an index of similarity and 
hierarchical clustering was performed according to Ward’s 
variance minimizing method.37,38 For the variable selection, 
the threshold of residual eigenvalues (≤ 0.70) in the original 
data matrix (18 samples × 36 variables = 648 data) was used 
to establish the maximum number of variables which could 
be removed. Effectively eliminated variables expressed the 
highest loadings in the lowest residual eigenvalues and also 
contributed ≤ 0.7% to the chemical profiles (average values).
Canonical Discriminant analysis via SAS CANDISC 
procedure (Statistical Analysis System, SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC, 1996) was used to differentiate samples and 
clusters on the basis of oil composition. The predictive ability 
of canonical discriminant functions was evaluated by cross-
validation and Jackknife approaches as implemented in SAS 
statistical package. Prior to the multivariate analysis, the 
data was preprocessed by auto-scaling and mean centering.
Average multiple comparisons were established by 
univariate variance analysis (ANOVA) using SAS GLM 
analyses. All data were checked for homoscedasticity with 
Hartley’s test. This test revealed significant deviation from 
the basic assumption for the oil components caryophyllene 
oxide (Table 1), allo-aromadendrene, d-selinene, germacrene 
A, spathulenol, germacrone and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 
which were arcsine and rank-transformed, respectively. 
Whenever a difference was established, a post-hoc Tukey 
test was performed. Results are shown as mean values 
and are joined by the standard deviation of independent 
measurements in some cases. P-values below 0.05 were 
regarded as significant.
Microorganisms
Yeast cells of a reference strain (ATCC 90659) and 
of three clinical isolates of P. brasiliensis recovered from 
patients with paracoccidioidomycosis were subcultured 
every seven days on agar Sabouraud medium (1% 
peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.1% brain heart infusion; 
4% glucose and 0.8% agar, pH 7.2) at 36 ± 1 °C prior to 
the susceptibility testing. 
Antifungal susceptibility test
Susceptibility testing was performed following the 
standard broth dilution method according to NCCLS-
CLSI M27-A2 guidelines with modifications.31 Briefly, 
for the inhibition assays, yeast cells in their exponential 
growth phase were kept on solid RPMI 1640 with 
glutamine and phenol red, supplemented with 0.2% 
glucose and buffered to a pH 7.0 with 0.165 mol L-1 
3-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS; Sigma, 
St. Louis) for seven days at 36 ± 1 °C. Sterile stock 
solutions of representative clustered oils from E. uniflora 
leaves were freshly prepared in DMSO. Serial twofold 
dilutions from stock solutions were prepared with sterile 
RPMI 1640 medium as the diluent to yield final essential 
oil concentrations ranging from 62.5 to 500 mg mL-1. 
Essential oils-free controls tubes were included. Inocula 
concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically 
via a yeast suspension in sterile 0.85% NaCl adjusted to 
85% transmittance at 520 nm. The mixture was vortexed 
to disperse aggregated cells density. Aliquots of 0.1 mL 
of this suspension were added to 2.4 mL of broth RPMI 
1640 containing the essential oil dilutions. This mixture 
was incubated at 36 °C in shaker at 120 rpm for 14 days 
and the transmittance was measured at 520 nm every 
48 h. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) was 
spectrophotometrically determined after the wells had 
been thoroughly mixed to produce a homogeneous 
suspension. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration 
at which the optical density (OD) was reduced to ≤ 50% 
of the OD of the growth control well after 8-10 days 
of incubation.39 Subsequently, the minimal fungicide 
concentration (MFC) was determined by the reinoculum 
of cultures in RPMI 1640 agar medium. MFC was 
defined as the lowest oil concentration which completely 
inhibited yeast growth after 10 days of incubation at 
36 °C. Duplicates were maintained for each concentration.
