(Vitaceae), which has strong antipyretic, antidoteand anticancer effects, is widely distributed in South China [1]. Our previous paper reportedthe isolation and characterization of six limonoids from the EtOAc fraction obtained bypartition of the MeOH extract [2]. In a continuation of the phytochemical research on thisplant, four new isoflavones were obtained from the n-BuOH fraction of the MeOH extract.Here, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of these four new isoflavones fromA. grossedentata Hand.-Mazz.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompound 1 was obtained as yellowish needles, mp. 171.5–172.88C, and analyzed forC17H12O7 by high resolution mass spectrometry. The UV (260, 325 nm), IR (1630 cm21,C ¼ O), 1HNMR (d 8.05, 1H, s, H-2) and 13CNMR (d 153.0, CH, C-2 and 124.0, C, C-3)ISSN 1028-6020 print/ISSN 1477-2213 online q 2002 Taylor & Francis LtdDOI: 10.1080/1028602021000049104*Corresponding author. Tel: þ86-028-85256156. E-mail: wdingyong@yahoo.com.cnJournal of Asian Natural Products Research, 2002 Vol. 4 (4), pp. 303–308spectra indicated that 1 is an isoflavone [3–4] (Fig. 1). The 1HNMR signals at d 9.40 (s, 1H),d 9.47 (s, 1H) and a singlet of three protons at d 3.85, showed the presence of two hydroxylgroups (which disappeared upon addition of D2O), and a methoxyl group, respectively.Moreover, the 1HNMR signal at d 6.02 (2H, s), 13CNMR signal at d 100.5 and IR absorptionband at 932 cm21 revealed the presence of a methylenedioxy group in 1. In the aromaticproton region, two doublets at d 7.65 (1H, J ¼ 2:5 Hz; H-20) and d 7.58 (1H, J ¼ 2:5 Hz;H-60), and two singlets at d 7.28 (1H, H-5) and d 6.70 (1H, H-8), suggested B-ringsubstitution at positions 30, 40 and 50, and A-ring substitution at positions 6 and 7,respectively. The fragments (EI-MS) at m/z 153 and 176 formed from retro-Diels-Aldercleavage, indicated 1 has two hydroxyl groups in A-ring, one methoxyl and onemethylenedioxy group in B-ring [5]. Two hydroxyls in A-ring were assigned to 6,7-positionby the facts of bathochromic shift of band I (þ13 nm) upon addition of NaOAc/H3BO3 in UVspectrum and the singlet peaks of H-5 and H-8 in 1HNMR spectrum [6]. The methylenedioxygroup on B-ring was suggested to be between C-40 and C-50 from the evidence of chemicalshifts and coupling constant of the aromatic protons at d 7.65 ppm (d, J ¼ 2:5 Hz; H-20) and d7.58 ppm (d, J ¼ 2:5 Hz; H-60) [7]. Thus, the substitution pattern of B-ring was revealed to be30-methoxy-40,50-methylenedioxy. Based on the above spectral characteristics, the structureof 1 was established as 6,7-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-40,50-methylenedioxyisoflavone, whichwas confirmed by the 13CNMR data (Table I) and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple-bondcorrelation) spectrum (Fig. 2). To our knowledge, 1 has not been reported previously fromany plant source.Compound 2, C23H22O12, was obtained as a yellowish amorphous solid. It gave a positiveMolish reaction. The UV spectrum showed absorptions at 261 and 322 nm. The IR spectrumshowed absorptions at 3350 (OH), 3026 (Ar–H), 1640 (CvO) and 1100–1000 cm21(glycoside function). The 1HNMR spectrum of 2 was distinctly similar to that of 1 withadditional signals for a sugar moiety. The anomeric signal appeared as a doublet at d 5.18ðJ ¼ 7:5 HzÞ indicating a b-linkage for the sugar. The 13CNMR spectrum (Table I) and FAB-MS at m/z 329 [Mþ þ 1–162] also indicated the presence of a sugar moiety in the molecule.Acid hydrolysis of 2 afforded an aglycone, which was identified as 1 (TLC, mp, IR, UV,1HNMR and 13CNMR) along with D-glucose. The exact position of the glucose unit wasdetermined by typical glycosylation shifts observed in the 13CNMR spectrum with respect tothe aglycone 1: upfield shifts of C-5 (ca. 2.0 ppm) and C-7 (ca. 2.1 ppm), and downfield shiftof C-6 (ca. 7.8 ppm) suggested the presence of a glucose unit at C-6 [8]. This was confirmedby HMBC experiment correlation between the glucose anomeric proton (dH 5.18) and theisoflavone C-6 (dC 153.3) carbon. Therefore, the structure of 2 was assigned as6,7-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-40,50-methylenedioxyisoflavone 6-O-b-D-glucopyranoside. Toour knowledge, this compound has not been reported previously.FIGURE 1 Chemical structure of compounds 1–4.D.-Y. WANG et al.304Compound 3, C23H22O11, was obtained as a yellow powder, and gave a positive Molishreaction. Its UVand IR were very similar to those of 2. 1HNMR and 13CNMR spectra showedsimilarity with those of 1 except for the additional signals of the sugar. The anomeric signalin 1HNMR appeared as a doublet at d 5.30 ðJ ¼ 1:5 HzÞ: Acid hydrolysis of 3 gave 1as the aglycone and L-rhamnose. The a-configuration of the rhamnosyl moietywas established by comparing its 13CNMR assignments with published values for methylFIGURE 2 Important HMBC correlations for compound 1.TABLE I 13CNMR data of compounds 1–4 in DMSO-d6 (100 Hz, d in ppm from TMS), DEPTC 1 2 3 42 153.0(CH) 152.3(CH) 152.5(CH) 153.0(CH)3 124.0(C) 124.0(C) 123.9(C) 123.7(C)4 178.0(C) 178.2(C) 178.1(C) 178.5(C)5 104.8(CH) 102.8(CH) 103.2(CH) 102.6(CH)6 145.5(C) 153.3(C) 152.5(C) 153.8(C)7 156.2(C) 154.1(C) 155.0(C) 154.3(C)8 95.9(CH) 95.8(CH) 96.0(CH) 97.0(CH)9 151.0(C) 151.0(C) 151.1(C) 151.0(C)10 116.5(C) 117.2(C) 117.0(C) 116.8(C)10 121.5(C) 120.3(C) 120.5(C) 121.0(C)20 114.9(CH) 115.0(CH) 114.9(CH) 115.1(CH)30 146.4(C) 146.5(C) 146.3(C) 146.4(C)40 147.8(C) 147.8(C) 147.8(C) 148.2(C)50 140.6(C) 141.0(C) 140.5(C) 141.3(C)60 111.2(CH) 111.4(CH) 111.4(CH) 101.6(CH)Glc-1 102.5(CH) 101.6(CH)2 73.0(CH) 73.1(CH)3 75.8(CH) 75.8(CH)4 69.9(CH) 70.0(CH)5 77.1(CH) 75.6(CH)6 60.3(CH2) 68.7(CH2)Rha-1 101.9(CH)2 71.0(CH)3 71.5(CH)4 73.1(CH)5 69.5(CH)6 18.4(CH)Xyl-1 105.1(CH)2 73.8(CH)3 76.5(CH)4 70.4(CH)5 66.3(CH)–OCH3 58.0(CH3) 58.3(CH3) 57.8(CH3) 59.5(CH3)–OCH2O– 100.5(CH2) 100.3(CH2) 98.9(CH2) 102.0(CH2)FOUR NEW ISOFLAVONES 305b-L-rhamnoside and methyl a-L-rhamnoside [9], which were in agreement with ana-configuration. The connectivity of the sugar residue to the aglycone was deduced fromHMBC, which showed a correlation between the rhamnose anomeric proton (d 5.30) and theisoflavone C-6 (d 152.5). FAB-MS at m/z 327 [Mþ þ 1–148] and 13CNMR data (Table I)also supported the above conclusion. Therefore, compound 3 was assigned to be 6,7-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-40,50-methylenedioxyisoflavone 6-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside. All ofthese results allow us to report the first isolation of this compound from nature.Compound 4, C28H30O16, was obtained as a yellowish amorphous powder, and also gave apositive Molish reaction. Its UV and IR were very similar to those of 2. 1HNMR and13CNMR spectra showed similarity with those of 1 except for the additional signals of thetwo sugar moieties. Acid hydrolysis of 4 gave an aglycone, D-glucose and D-xylose. Spectraldata for the aglycone were identical to 1. The nature and stereochemistry of the glycosylmoieties, viz. b-D-xylosyl and b-D-glucosyl, were determined from anomeric protonresonances at dH 4.20 (1H, d, J ¼ 7:2 Hz; xyl-1-H) and dH 5.15 (1H, d, J ¼ 7:5 Hz; glc-1-H), respectively. The connectivity of the sugar residues to the aglycone nucleus was deducedfrom HMBC, which showed a correlation between the glucose anomeric proton (dH 5.15)and the isoflavone C-6 (dC 153.8) carbon. Furthermore, the xylose anomeric proton (dH4.20) showed an HMBC correlation with the glucose C-6, indicating 1–6 linkage betweenxylose and glucose. The sequence of sugar residues was further confirmed by FAB-MS,which showed loss of xylose (m/z 489 [Mþ2 xylose]) before loss of glucose (m/z 327[Mþ2 xylose 2 glucose]). Thus, compound 4 was identified as 6,7-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-40,50-methylenedioxyisoflavone 6-O-b-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-6)-b-D-glucopyranoside, and isreported for the first time.TABLE II 1H-NMR data of compounds 1–4 in DMSO-d6 (400 MHz,d in ppm from TMS)H 1 2 3 42 8.05(s) 8.10(s) 7.98(s) 8.01(s)5 7.28(s) 7.28(s) 7.30(s) 7.31(s)8 6.70(s) 6.76(s) 6.75(s) 6.74(s)20 7.65(d,2.5*) 7.65(d,2.1) 7.68(d,2.5) 7.66(d,2.3)60 7.58(d,2.5) 7.58(d,2.1) 7.61(d,2.5) 7.58(d,2.3)Glc-1 5.18(d,7.5) 5.15(d,7.5)2 3.30(m) 3.33(m)3 3.30(m) 3.31(m)4 3.18(m) 3.20(m)5 3.47(m) 3.45(m)6-a 3.42(m) 3.62(m)6-b 3.70(m) 3.91(m)Rha-1 5.30(d,1.5)2 3.67(m)3 3.32(m)4 3.20(m)5 3.75(m)6 1.18(d,6.2)Xyl-1 4.20(d,7.2)2 3.05(m)3 3.07(m)4 3.30(m)5-a 2.95(m)5-b 3.70(m)–OCH3 3.85(s) 3.88(s) 3.85(s) 3.90(s)–OCH2O– 6.02(s) 6.00(s) 6.00(s) 6.03(s)* Coupling constant in Hz.D.-Y.

Optical rotation was measured with a DIP-181 instrument. NMR spectra wererun on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained on a MAT-112 massspectrometer. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer 599B and ShimadzuUV-250 spectrometers, respectively. TLC was performed on silica gel GF and HRTLC onsilica gel H (5–7mm). Separation and purification were performed by columnchromatography on silica gel (160–200 and 200–300 mesh).Plant MaterialThe whole plants of A. grossedentata Hand.-Mazz. were collected from Fujian Province ofChina in September 2000, and identified by Prof. Yongtian Zhang, Fujian Institute ofSubtropical Botany, China. A voucher specimen (No. 2000912) has been deposited in theauthor’s laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Zhangzhou Teacher’s College, Zhangzhou363000, China.Extraction and IsolationCrushed plant material (1.5 kg, 20–30 mesh) was extracted three times with boilingMeOH. The MeOH extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to givea viscous residue (485 g). This was suspended in H2O and partitioned with CHCl3(102 g), EtOAc (48 g) and n-BuOH (210 g), successively. A part of the n-BuOH fraction(35 g) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using CHCl3–MeOH–H2O(10:3.5:1) to give four fractions. Recrystallization of the fractions 1–3 from MeOHyielded compounds 1 (45 mg), 3 (26 mg) and 2 (78 mg). Compound 4 (51 mg) wasisolated from fraction 4 by reverse phase column chromatography [MeOH–H2O (2:3)as eluent].Compound 1.
