De Sanctis, I-86100 Campobasso, ItalyA phytochemical analysis of the polar extract from the red bulbs of Allium cepa L. var. Tropea, typicalof Calabria, a southern region of Italy, was performed extensively for the first time, leading to theisolation of four new furostanol saponins, named tropeoside A1/A2 (1a/1b) and tropeoside B1/B2(3a/3b), along with the respective 22-O-methyl derivatives (2a/2b and 4a/4b), almost certainlyextraction artifacts. High concentrations of ascalonicoside A1/A2 (5a/5b) and ascalonicoside B (6),previously isolated from Allium ascalonicum Hort., were also found. This is the first report of furostanolsaponins in this A. cepa variety. The chemical structures of the new compounds were establishedthrough a combination of extensive nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and chemicalanalyses. High concentrations of quercetin, quercetin 4I-glucoside, taxifolin, taxifolin 7-glucoside, andphenylalanine were also isolated. The new saponins were found to possess antispasmodic activityin the guinea pig isolated ileum; such an effect might contribute to explaining the traditional use ofonion in the treatment of disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract.KEYWORDS: Alliaceae; red onion; saponins; tropeosides A and B; flavonoids; antispasmodic activityINTRODUCTIONOnion (Allium cepa L.) is one of the oldest cultivated plants,and it is now used both as a food and for medical purposes. Infact, onion is a rich source of a number of phytonutrients, whichmake it an important element of the Mediterranean diet. It isalso useful for the treatment or prevention of a number ofdiseases, including cancer, coronary heart disease, obesity,hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cataract,and disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., colic pain,flatulent colic, and dyspepsia) (1).The history of the onion is well documented and can be tracedto its origin in a wide area from India to Israel, where itsproduction started in 3000 B.C., and then it was introduced inEurope by the Phoenicians around 2000 years ago. In ancientEgypt, the onion was believed to be a sacred food, and it wasalso widely consumed by the Romans and Greeks, who likedits taste and knew of its curative properties (2). Accordingly,Pliny the Elder, in his Naturalis historia, lists 30 ailments thatcan be treated by onions and pointed out that any dishescontaining the onions are, to a certain extent, curative as wellas more nourishing and tasty. Epidemiological studies haveconsistently shown an inverse association between consumptionof vegetables (onion included) and the risk of human diseases.Notably, a population-based case-control study showed that theconsumption of Allium vegetables was associated with a reducedrisk of prostate cancer (3). These observations prompted us tocontinue the phytochemical investigation into this prolific sourceof interesting compounds.The red onion, A. cepa L. var. Tropea, is a typical Italianvariety, cultivated in some areas of southern Italy (Calabriaregion). This variety, characterized by both white and purpleflowers, is known for its distinctive bulb, lengthened or oval,red, and sweet. Analysis of the MeOH extract from the bulbsof Tropea onions revealed the presence of high concentrationsof flavonoids and saponins. Among these, four saponins, namedtropeosides A1/A2 (1a/1b) and B1/B2 (3a/3b), appeared to benew compounds.Plant-derived saponins present a broad spectrum of biologicaluses, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, ion channel block-ing, immune stimulating, antifungal, antithrombotic, and hy-pocholesterolemic properties (4, 5). Due to the traditional useof onion in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract disturbances,the isolated saponins have been tested for the first time toevaluate an eventual antispasmodic activity on the guinea pigisolated ileum, and the results will be discussed herein.* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed (telephone+39-0874-404649; fax +39-0874-404652; e-mail lanzotti@unimol.it).† Dipartimento di Chimica delle Sostanze Naturali, Universita` di NapoliFederico II.‡ Universita` degli Studi del Molise.§ Dipartimento di Farmacologia Sperimentale, Universita` di NapoliFederico II.J.

Optical rotations were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 192 polarimeter equipped with a sodium lamp (589 nm) and a10-cm microcell. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and125 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. Chemicalshifts were referred to the residual solvent signal (CD3OD: ä‚ 3.31,äC 49.0). The multiplicities of 13C NMR resonances were determinedby DEPT experiments. 1H connectivities were determined using COSYand HOHAHA experiments; the 2D HOHAHA experiments wereperformed in the phase-sensitive mode (TPPI) using the MLEV-17(mixing time of 125 ms) sequence. One-bond heteronuclear 1H-13Cconnectivities were determined with a 2D HSQC pulse sequence withan interpulse delay set for 1JCH of 130 Hz. Two- and three-bondheteronuclear 1H-13C connectivities were determined with 2D HMBCexperiments, optimized for 2-3JCH of 8 Hz. Nuclear Overhauser effect(NOE) measurements were performed by 2D ROESY experiments.High-resolution FAB mass spectra (glycerol matrix) were measuredon a Prospect Fisons mass spectrometer. Medium-pressure liquidchromatography (MPLC) was performed on a Bu¨chi 861 apparatususing LiChroprep RP-18 (40-63 ím) columns. HPLC in isocratic modewas performed on a Varian apparatus equipped with an RI-3 refractiveindex detector using a Waters semipreparative 300  7.5 mm i.d.í-Bondapack C18 column (injection amount ) 180 íL, flow rate )2.5 mL/min) and an analytical 300  3.9 mm i.d. í-Bondapack C18column (injection amount ) 100 íL, flow rate ) 0.8 mL/min).Plant Material, Extraction, and Isolation. Cultivated bulbs of A.cepa L. var. Tropea were collected in Tropea (Calabria, Italy) in April2003. A voucher specimen (no. 2003ACT1) has been deposited at theDipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Agroalimentari, Ambientali eMicrobiologiche, Campobasso. Fresh bulbs (5.05 kg) were finely hand-cut and then exhaustively extracted, at room temperature, first withCHCl3/MeOH (9:1) and then with pure MeOH. Each solvent extractionwas conducted for several days and was repeated four times using 4 Lof solvent, under stirring. The MeOH extract (241 g) was partitionedbetween water and BuOH to remove sugar compounds and water, andthe organic layer was then filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afforda crude extract (44.7 g), which was chromatographed by MPLC on anRP-18 column, using a linear gradient from H2O to MeOH. PreliminaryNMR studies revealed that fractions eluted from H2O/MeOH (7:3) toH2O/MeOH (4:6) contained flavonoids in high concentrations andfractions eluted from H2O/MeOH (3:7) to H2O/MeOH (1:9) containedsaponins as major metabolites.Fractions eluted in H2O/MeOH (7:3) (231.6 mg) and H2O/MeOH(6:4) (551.3 mg) yielded the known taxifolin 7-glucoside (29.5 mg)and taxifolin (490.4 mg), respectively. This last fraction also containedthe amino acid phenylalanine in relatively high amounts (50.1 mg).Fractions eluted in H2O/MeOH (1:1) (215.3 mg) and H2O/MeOH (4:6) (501.6 mg) yielded the known quercetin 4I-glucoside (140.5 mg)and the flavonol quercetin (511.8 mg), respectively.The fraction eluted in H2O/MeOH (3:7) (271.2 mg) yielded theknown saponin ascalonicoside A1/A2 (5a/5b, 235.9 mg) (Figure 1),whereas ascalonicoside B (6, 250.6 mg) was found in the fraction elutedin H2O/MeOH (2:8) (435.1 mg) (6). The last fraction, H2O/MeOH (1:9), 375.3 mg, was further purified by HPLC on a semipreparative C18column with a mobile phase of H2O/MeOH (3:7), affording the mixturesof new saponins tropeoside A1/A2 (1a/1b, 67.4 mg, tR ) 11.0 min)and tropeoside B1/B2 (3a/3b, 106.4 mg, tR ) 14.6 min).

A solution of eachisolated compound (1 mg) in 1 N HCl (0.25 mL) was stirred at 80 °Cfor 4 h. On cooling, the solution was concentrated in a stream of N2.The residue was dissolved in 1-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole (Trisil-Z) andpyridine (0.1 mL), and the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 5 min.After the solution had been dried with a stream of N2, the residue wasseparated by water and CH2Cl2 (1 mL, 1:1). The CH2Cl2 layer wasanalyzed by GC on a 25 m  0.32 mm  25 m l-Chirasil-Val column(Alltech, Deerfield, IL). Temperatures for the injector and detector were200 °C, and the temperature gradient system for the oven was asfollows: 100 °C for 1 min, raised to 180 °C at 5 °C/min. Peaks of thehydrolysate of 1a/1b were detected at 12.89 (L-rhamnose) and 13.77min (D-galactose), in the ratio of 1:1. Peaks of the hydrolysate of 3a/3b were detected at 10.97 (D-xylose) and 12.90 min (L-rhamnose), inthe ratio of 1:1. Retention times for authentic samples after being treatedsimultaneously with Trisil-Z were 12.78 (D-rhamnose) and 12.89 min(L-rhamnose); 13.77 (D-galactose) and 13.84 min (L-galactose); and10.97 (D-xylose) and 11.05 min (L-xylose). Co-injection of eachhydrolysate with standard D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and D-xylose gavesingle peaks.Figure 1. Saponins of A. cepa L. var. Tropea.936 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 4, 2005 Corea et al.Biological Assay. Male guinea pigs (250-350 g,) (Harlan, Italy)were killed by asphyxiation with CO2, and segments (1-1.5 cm) ofileum were removed, flushed of luminal contents, and placed in Krebssolution (119 mM NaCl, 4.75 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mMNaHCO3, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM MgSO4, and 11 mM glucose). Thesegments were prepared as previously described (7). In brief, thesegments were set up in such a way as to record contractions mainlyfrom the longitudinal axis, in an organ bath containing 20 mL of Krebsequilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The tissues wereconnected to an isotonic transducer (load ) 0.5 g), connected to aGemini recording apparatus (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Ileal segmentswere allowed to equilibrate for 60 min before experiments. To evaluatethe antispasmodic activity of the tested compounds, contractions wereelicited by acetylcholine (10-7 M) or histamine (10-7). After stablecontrol contractions evoked by acetylcholine (or histamine) had beenrecorded, the responses were observed in the presence of increasingconcentrations (10-8-10-5 M) of the tested compounds (or papaverine,used as a reference compound). The contact time for each concentrationwas 30 min. Ascalonicoside and tropeosides were dissolved in DMSO.DMSO (<0.01%) did not modify acetylcholine- or histamine-inducedcontractions. Results are expressed as mean ( SEM. Nonlinearregression analysis for all concentration response curves was performed.Data were analyzed by ANOVA. The results were considered to besignificant if the probability of error was <5%.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBulbs of red onion, A. cepa L. var. Tropea, were exhaustivelyextracted with CHCl3/MeOH, 9:1, and MeOH. The MeOHextracts were partitioned between butanol and water, and thebutanol-soluble portions were separated by sequential chro-matographic techniques, affording, as major metabolites, furo-stanol saponins (total saponin content ) 130.75 mg/kg) andflavonoids (total flavonoid concentration ) 232.12 mg/kg). Asmajor saponin metabolites, we have isolated four new furostanolsaponins (Figure 1), named tropeosides A1/A2 (1a/1b) and B1/B2 (3a/3b), the known ascalonicoside A1/A2 (5a/5b), andascalonicoside B (6), previously isolated from Allium ascaloni-cum Hort. (6). Concerning the flavonoids, quercetin, quercetin4I-glucoside, both already described from A. cepa (8), taxifolin,and taxifolin 7-glucoside have been also found.Tropeoside A1 (1a, Figure 1) was isolated as a whiteamorphous solid and showed in the negative FAB MS spectruma pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 755 [M - H]-. High-resolution measurements on the pseudomolecular ion peakindicated the molecular formula C39H64O14. Diagnostic reso-nances in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1a (CD3OD, Tables 1 and3) were those attributed to two tertiary methyls (ä 0.80 and1.09), three secondary methyls (ä 0.97, 0.99, and 1.25), andone olefinic (ä 5.55), and two anomeric (ä 4.30 and 5.30)protons. The 13C NMR spectrum (Tables 2 and 3) showed 39resonance lines, supporting the molecular formula deduced fromMS, 27 of them attributed to the aglycon and 12 to twomonosaccharides. Analysis of 2D COSY, HOHAHA, HSQC,and HMBC spectra of 1a allowed assignment of all the signalsbelonging to the aglycon moiety, which was identified as atrihydroxylated steroid of the furostanol type. In particular, ringA constitutes an isolated spin system possessing two hydroxylgroups at positions 1 and 3 (Table 1). The NOE effect betweenH-1 and H-3, observed in a ROESY spectrum (Figure 2),indicated the cis orientation of the two OH groups of ring A.The third hydroxyl group of the aglycon was easily located onthe hemiacetal carbon at C-22 (ä 110.0). The 25R stereochem-istry of the side chain was deduced by the resonances of protonsand carbons at C-25, C-26, and C-27 and by the vicinalTable 1. 1H NMR Data of the Aglycon Portion of Tropeosides A1 (1a), A2 (1b), B1 (3a), and B2 (3b) (Spectra Measured in CD3OD at 500 MHz)äH (int, mult, J in Hz)position 1a 1b 3a 3b1 3.36 (1H, dd, 7.2, 3.5) 3.36 (1H, dd, 7.2, 3.5) 3.36 (1H, dd, 7.2, 3.5) 3.36 (1H, dd, 7.2, 3.5)2a 2.08a 2.06a 2.09a 2.07ab 1.70a 1.70a 1.70a 1.70a3 3.31a 3.30a 3.30a 3.29a4a 2.24 (1H, dd, 11.5, 7.3) 2.23 (1H, dd, 11.5, 7.3) 2.27 (1H, dd, 11.5, 7.3) 2.26 (1H, dd, 11.5, 7.3)b 2.20 (1H, dd, 11.5, 3.5) 2.20 (1H, dd, 11.5, 3.5) 2.21 (1H, dd, 11.5, 3.5) 2.21 (1H, dd, 11.5, 3.5)6 5.55 (1H, dd, 5.5, 2.5) 5.55 (1H, dd, 5.5, 2.5) 5.56 (1H, dd, 5.5, 2.5) 5.56 (1H, dd, 5.5, 2.5)7a 1.98a 1.98a 1.98a 1.98ab 1.96a 1.96a 1.98a 1.98a8 1.52 (1H, m) 1.52 (1H, m) 1.50 (1H, m) 1.50 (1H, m)9 1.31a 1.31a 1.29a 1.29a11a 2.56 (1H, dd, 10.5, 2.5) 2.55 (1H, dd, 10.5, 2.5) 2.55 (1H, dd, 10.5, 2.5) 2.54 (1H, dd, 10.5, 2.5)b 1.41 (1H, m) 1.42 (1H, m) 1.43 (1H, m) 1.44 (1H, m)12a 1.70a 1.70a 1.70a 1.70ab 1.19a 1.20a 1.20a 1.21a14 1.17a 1.17a 1.16a 1.16a15a 1.98a 1.98a 1.98a 1.98ab 1.31a 1.31a 1.31a 1.31a16 4.60 (1H, q, 5.5) 4.38 (1H, q, 5.5) 4.60 (1H, q, 5.5) 4.39 (1H, q, 5.5)17 1.72a 1.67a 1.72a 1.67a18 0.80 (3H, s) 0.79 (3H, s) 0.80 (3H, s) 0.79 (3H, s)19 1.09 (3H, s) 1.10 (3H, s) 1.09 (3H, s) 1.08 (3H, s)20 2.07a 2.09a 2.08a 2.10a21 0.99 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.96 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.99 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.96 (3H, d, 6.6)23a 1.72 a 1.75 a 1.72a 1.75ab 1.63a 1.61a 1.63a 1.61a24a 1.40a 1.36a 1.40a 1.36ab 1.31a 1.32a 1.31a 1.32a25 1.71a 1.71a 1.71a 1.71a26a 3.87 (1H, dd, 8.5, 6.9) 3.87 (1H, dd, 8.5, 6.9) 3.85 (1H, dd, 8.5, 6.9) 3.85 (1H, dd, 8.5, 6.9)b 3.30a 3.30a 3.30a 3.30a27 0.97 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.97 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.97 (3H, d, 6.6) 0.97 (3H, d, 6.6)aOverlapped with other signals.Antispasmodic Saponins from Red Onions J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 4, 2005 937couplings between H-25 and the two H-26, in comparison withliterature data (9). The ROESY correlations (Figure 2) H-11/H3-19, H-11/H3-18, H-9/H-14, H-14/H-16, H-12/H-17, andH-17/H3-21 completed the relative stereochemistry of 1a withthe usual B/C trans, C/D trans, D/E cis, and C-20R stereochem-istries (10, 11). On the basis of those data, the stereochemistryof the aglycon chiral centers has been assigned as in Figure 1,except for the stereochemistry at C-22, which will be discussedbelow.Concerning the sugar portions of the molecule, the first stepof the analysis was the association of the two anomeric carbons(ä 100.7 and 101.3) with the relevant anomeric proton signals(ä 4.30 and 5.30, respectively), through the HSQC experiment.The nature of the monosaccharides was determined by analysisof 2D COSY, HOHAHA, HSQC, and HMBC spectra. Startingfrom the anomeric proton at ä 4.30 (H-1 Gal), we identifiedthe sequence of a hexopyranose unit. The large couplingconstants observed in a 2D HOHAHA subspectrum for H-1 Gal/H-2 Gal and H-2 Gal/H-3 Gal, and the relatively small couplingconstant of H-3 Gal/H-4 Gal, together with the ROESYcorrelation H-3 Gal/H-5 Gal, indicated its â-galactopyranosenature. With the same type of analysis the sugar linked at C-26was identified as a 6-deoxyhexopyranose. Within its spin system,the axial-axial H-3 Rha/H-4 Rha and H-4 Rha/H-5 Rhacouplings and the equatorial-axial H-2 Rha/H-3 Rha relation-ship led to the assignment of a rhamnose. Its R-anomericconfiguration, suggested by the very small J value of H-1 Rha,resonating as a broad singlet, was confirmed by the chemicalshift of C-3 Rha and C-5 Rha (Table 3), in accordance withdata reported in the literature (10, 12). The â-galactose wasplaced at C-1 of tropeoside A1 by interpretation of the keyHMBC correlation peak (Figure 2) between H-1 Gal (ä 4.30)and C-1 (ä 84.6), this junction being also confirmed by thestrong ROESY peak (Figure 2) between H-1 Gal and H-1(ä 3.36). The R-rhamnose had to be linked at position 26 onthe furostanol structure of the aglycon. In fact, we observedthe HMBC cross-peak (Figure 2) between C-26 (ä 75.9) andH-1 Rha (ä 5.30).To confirm the nature of the sugar units and to determinetheir absolute configuration, 1a was subjected to acid hydrolysis(1 N HCl), followed by trimethylsilylation and GC analysis ona chiral column in comparison with both series of galactoseand rhamnose. By this procedure the sugars were identified asD-galactose and L-rhamnose. This procedure was applied to allof the new isolated compounds.Table 2. 13C NMR Data of the Aglycon Portion of Tropeosides A1(1a), A2 (1b), B1 (3a), and B2 (3b) (Spectra Measured in CD3OD at125 MHz)äC (mult)position 1a 1b 3a 3b1 84.6 (CH) 84.6 (CH) 84.6 (CH) 84.6 (CH)2 37.5 (CH2) 37.5 (CH2) 37.3 (CH2) 37.3 (CH2)3 69.4 (CH) 69.4 (CH) 69.1 (CH) 69.1 (CH)4 43.3 (CH2) 43.3 (CH2) 43.4 (CH2) 43.4 (CH2)5 139.4 (C) 139.4 (C) 139.6 (C) 139.6 (C)6 125.8 (CH) 125.8 (CH) 125.9 (CH) 125.9 (CH)7 32.5 (CH2) 32.3 (CH2) 32.7 (CH2) 32.5 (CH2)8 33.9 (CH) 33.9 (CH) 34.1 (CH) 34.1 (CH)9 51.5 (CH) 51.5 (CH) 51.5 (CH) 51.5 (CH)10 43.2 (C) 43.2 (C) 43.4 (C) 43.4 (C)11 24.5 (CH2) 24.5 (CH2) 24.7 (CH2) 24.7 (CH2)12 40.9 (CH2) 40.9 (CH2) 41.1 (CH2) 41.0 (CH2)13 41.1 (C) 41.1 (C) 41.2 (C) 41.2 (C)14 57.9 (CH) 57.9 (CH) 58.0 (CH) 58.0 (CH)15 32.7 (CH2) 32.7 (CH2) 32.9 (CH2) 32.9 (CH2)16 82.1 (CH) 82.1 (CH) 82.3 (CH) 82.3 (CH)17 63.8 (CH) 63.7 (CH) 63.9 (CH) 63.8 (CH)18 17.3 (CH3) 17.2 (CH3) 17.1 (CH3) 17.0 (CH3)19 15.1 (CH3) 15.0 (CH3) 15.2 (CH3) 15.1 (CH3)20 40.8 (CH) 40.6 (CH) 41.1 (CH) 40.8 (CH)21 17.0 (CH3) 17.3 (CH3) 16.4 (CH3) 16.6 (CH3)22 110.0 (C) 113.0 (C) 111.0 (C) 114.0 (C)23 37.4 (CH2) 37.2 (CH2) 37.3 (CH2) 37.0 (CH2)24 31.3 (CH2) 31.1 (CH2) 31.4 (CH2) 31.3 (CH2)25 34.2 (CH) 34.2 (CH) 34.1 (CH) 34.1 (CH)26 75.9 (CH2) 76.0 (CH2) 76.0 (CH2) 76.2 (CH2)27 18.2 (CH3) 18.2 (CH3) 17.5 (CH3) 17.5 (CH3)Table 3. 1H and 13C NMR Data of the Sugar Portion of 1a/1b (Data Extracted from 1a) and 3a/3b (Data Extracted from 3a) (Spectra Measured inCD3OD at 500 and 125 MHz)1a 3aposition äH (int, mult, J in Hz) äC (mult) position äH (int, mult, J in Hz) äC (mult)Gal Xyl1 4.30 (1H, d, 7.8) 100.7 (CH) 1 4.27 (1H, d, 7.5) 101.0 (CH)2 3.70 (1H, dd, 7.8, 6.8) 74.0 (CH) 2 3.68 (1H, dd, 7.5, 6.8) 74.1 (CH)3 3.68 (1H, dd, 6.8, 2.5) 75.2 (CH) 3 3.88 (1H, dd, 7.0, 6.8) 75.6 (CH)4 3. 87 (1H, dd, 3.2, 2.5) 76.6 (CH) 4 3.65 (1H, ddd, 2.0, 7.0, 8.5) 69.6 (CH)5a 3.44a 74.0 (CH) 5a 3.50 (1H, dd, 2.0, 11.5) 66.0 (CH2)5b 5b 3.95 (1H, dd, 8.5, 11.5)6a 3.47a 62.2 (CH2)6b 3.65aRha Rha1 5.30 (1H, bs) 101.3 (CH) 1 5.30 (1H, bs) 101.5 (CH)2 3.89 (1H, bs) 72.2 (CH) 2 3.90 (1H, bs) 72.3 (CH)3 3.72 (1H, d, 6.5) 70.6 (CH) 3 3.72 (1H, d, 6.5) 70.7 (CH)4 3.40 (1H, dd, 6.5, 6.0) 72.0 (CH) 4 3.39 (1H, dd, 6.5, 6.0) 72.1 (CH)5 4.10 (1H, dq, 6.6, 6.0) 69.0 (CH) 5 4.10 (1H, dq, 6.6, 6.0) 67.4 (CH)6 1.25 (3H, d, 6.6) 18.2 (CH3) 6 1.25 (3H, d, 6.6) 18.3 (CH3)a Overlapped with other signals.Figure 2. Selected HMBC (HfC) and ROESY (HTH) correlationsobserved for compound 1a.938 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 4, 2005 Corea et al.High-resolution FABMS indicated that tropeoside A2 (1b)was isomeric with tropeoside A1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectraof 1b (Tables 1-3) were almost identical with that of 1a, butslightly different in the resonances of the atoms located nearC-22. This suggested that the two compounds were epimershaving the opposite configuration at the hemiacetal carbon (C-22). This was confirmed by the observation that both 1a and1b, after being kept one night in aqueous solution at roomtemperature, gave rise to an equilibrium between the two forms(about 40% of 1a and 60% of 1b). We have tentatively assignedthe 22R orientation to tropeoside A1 and 22â orientation totropeoside A2 on the basis of the downfield shift in the 1H NMRresonances of H3-21 and H-16 of 1a, in comparison with thoseof 1b (H3-21 ä 0.99 instead of 0.96; H-16 ä 4.60 instead of4.38), due to the deshielding effect of the cis-oriented OH-22group (13).The structure elucidation of tropeoside B1 (3a) was aidedby comparison with the MS and NMR data obtained for 1a.The high-resolution FABMS gave the molecular formula of 3aas C38H62O13, which differs from 1a in being 30 amu less. TheNMR profiles of 3a (Tables 1-3) appeared to be superimpos-able with those of 1a for the signals relative to the aglycon andto the R-rhamnose. Differences were related to the second sugarunit, which by MS and 2D NMR analyses appeared to be basedon a pentopyranose structure. The large coupling constantsobserved in a 2D HOHAHA subspectrum for H-1 Xyl/H-2 Xyl,H-2 Xyl/H-3 Xyl, and H-3/H-4 Xyl indicated a â-xylopyranosylnature. This was confirmed by acid hydrolysis, followed bysilylation and analysis on a chiral column, which affordedD-xylose and L-rhamnose. Diagnostic HMBC correlations ofH-1I with C-1 and of H-1II with C-26 located xylose andrhamnose at C-1 and C-26, respectively, thus fully defining thestructure of 3a.Mass spectrometric analysis of tropeoside B2 (3b) showedthe same molecular formula as that of 3a. In analogy, the NMRprofiles (Tables 1-3) also revealed the same structure for bothcompounds, indicating that the difference had to be limited tothe stereochemistry of a chiral carbon. As observed for 1a/1b,the two compounds 3a/3b were in equilibrium if left in solutionovernight. We therefore determined the structure of 3b as theepimer of 3a at the hemiacetal carbon. The assignments of the1H and 13C NMR spectra, obtained through 2D NMR spectra,are reported in Tables 1-3. On the basis of the same argumentsas for 1a/1b, we tentatively assigned the configurations 22R to3a and 22â to 3b.Compounds 2a/2b and 4a/4b showed 1H and 13C NMRspectra superimposable with those of 1a/1b and 3a/3b, respec-tively. The only difference was the presence of an additionalmethoxy group signal in each spectrum of 2a/2b and 4a/4b [1HNMR, ä 3.12 (3H, s); 13C NMR, ä 47.2]. This allowed us toidentify compounds 2a/2b and 4a/4b as the 22-O-methylderivatives of 1a/1b and 3a/3b, respectively, from which theyoriginate during the extraction and purification steps. This wasconfirmed by repeating the extraction procedure in acetone andobserving the absence of 2a/2b and 4a/4b in the extract andtheir successive formation during the purification of tropeosidesA1/A2 and B1/B2 by HPLC.Finally, we have also isolated in high amounts the trisaccha-ride saponins ascalonicosides A1/A2 (5a/5b) and B (6), recentlyreported by some of the authors from shallot (6).Because one of the remarkable traditional uses of onion isthe treatment of intestinal spasm, in the present study we haveinvestigated the possible antispasmodic effect of the isolatedsaponins on the contractions elicited by acetylcholine andhistamine in the isolated guinea pig ileum. The pharmacologicalresults are shown in Figure 3. Tropeosides A1/A2 and B1/B2reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, the contractionsevoked by both acetylcholine (Figure 3A) and histamine(Figure 3B). The effect was significant at the concentration of10-5 M (50% inhibition). By contrast, ascalonicoside A1/A2did not show any significant effect. Papaverine, used as areference compound, inhibited both acetylcholine-induced (per-cent inhibition, 10-8 M, 4 ( 3; 10-7 M, 16 ( 4; 10-6 M, 32 (5; 10-5 M, 68 ( 5; 10-4 M, 89 ( 6, n ) 4) and histamine-induced (percent inhibition, 10-8 M, 3 ( 4; 10-7 M, 14 ( 6;10-6 M, 35 ( 5; 10-5 M, 71 ( 4; 10-4 M, 90 ( 4, n ) 4)contractions.Comparison of the chemical structures of the tested com-pounds in terms of bioactivity suggested that the presence of afurther sugar in ascalonicoside A1/A2 results in the loss of theantispasmodic activity.With regard to the flavonoids, the finding of high concentra-tions agree with the observation that onions are characterizedFigure 3.

Food Chem., Vol. 53, No. 4, 2005 939generally by a higher content of flavonoids if compared to garlicand leek (14, 15). From the biological point of view, flavonoidsare considered to be important factors of the overall antioxidantactivity of dietary plants (16, 17). In particular, quercetin hasshown an anti-HIV property (18) and the ability to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from oxidation, therebyreducing the risk of cardiovascular (19) and neurodegenerativediseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. In addition,flavonoids including quercetin and taxifolin also affect thegastrointestinal tract by possessing antiulcer, antispasmodic, andantidiarrheal activities (20). For all of these reasons, the findingof high concentrations of saponins and flavonols in bulbs ofTropea red onion makes it a healthy food in the Mediterraneandiet. In addition, because these onions are often consumeduncooked, due to their crispness and sweetness, these phyto-nutrients are totally preserved.In conclusion, the present study reports the isolation of highconcentrations of flavonoids and saponins from a common food,the red onion. Among them, we have characterized two newsaponins that exhibited antispasmodic activity. This result maybe important from ethnopharmacological, pharmaceutical, ornutritional points of view. From an ethnopharmacological pointof view, the antispasmodic activity of these compounds, togetherwith the previously reported antispasmodic activity of flavonoids(7), might contribute to the justification of the traditional useof onion in the treatment of intestinal spasms. From apharmaceutical point of view, the antispasmodic activity mayopen the way to study in vivo the effect of the isolatedcompounds in models of intestinal hyperactivity. Last but notleast, from a nutritional point of view, the presence in onion ofcompounds with antispasmodic activity may provide input toperform epidemiological studies aiming at investigating therelationship between onion intake and chronic digestive illnesses,characterized by hypercontractility of intestinal smooth muscles(e.g., irritable bowel syndrome).ACKNOWLEDGMENTWe warmly thank the Azienda Agricola of Gennaro Petracca(S.
