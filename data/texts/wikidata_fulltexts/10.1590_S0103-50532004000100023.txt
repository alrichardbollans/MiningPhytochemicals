Chromatographic fractionation of leaves and branches extracts from Luxemburgia octandra
(Ochnaceae) afforded isoliquiritigenin, 3’-hydroxyisoliquiritigenin, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, lupeol,
betulinic acid, the biflavonoid, 4’,5,7-trihydroxyflavone-(3’→O→4’”)-5”,7”-dihydroxyflavanone
and a new bichalcone 4,2’,4’-trihydroxychalcone-(3→O→4”)-2’”,4’”-dihydroxychalcone

including 2D-NMR experiments of the natural substances and of the luxenchalcone methyl derivative.

Introduction
Luxemburgia octandra St. Hil (Ochnaceae) is a shrub
or small tree distributed throughout the Brazilian
Southeastern region. Ochnaceae is a large tropical family
including ca. 40 genera and 600 species with the greatest
concentration in tropical South America.1 In the course of
our phytochemical and pharmacological investigations of
Brazilian plants, we have studied species of both Ouratea
and Luxemburgia genera, in which the presence of
biflavonoids was observed2-5 along with their antitumoral
activities.6,7 The biflavonoid 4’,5,7-trihydroxyflavone-
(3’→O→4’”)-5”,7”-dihydroxyflavanone was isolated
from Luxemburia noilis4 and from L. octandra (present
work) have shown antitumoral activities.6 No previous
work has been reported on L. octandra species.
Experimental
General procedures
Melting points are uncorrected. IR spectra were
recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1600/1605 FT-IR spectro-
photometer using KBr disks or NaCl film. NMR spectra in
D
3
CCOCD

, CD

 were recorded on Bruker
(200 MHz for 1H and 50.3 MHz for 13C) and on Jeol JNM-
GX-400 (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C) spectro-
meters using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard.
Electron Ionization Mass Spectra (EIMS) were taken with
Gas Chromatography coupled to a Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) on Varian Saturn 2000 and high resolution
electron spray ionization mass spectra (HRESIMS) was
obtained with a VG 7070E – HF spectrometer. CC: silica
gel (Merck and Aldrich 0.05-0.20 mm); TLC: silica gel H
or G (Merck and Aldrich) was used to analyze the fractions
collected from column chromatography (CC) with
visualization by UV (254 and 366 nm), AlCl
3
-EtOH (1%)
and exposure to iodine vapor.

Plant material
Luxemburgia octandra St. Hil was collected in Morro
de São Sebastião, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil and
authenticated by the botanist Jorge L. Silva. A voucher
specimen (Nº 26197) is deposited at the OUPR-UFOP
Herbarium, Instituto de Ciências Exatas e Biológicas of
the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto-MG, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation
Dried leaves (621g) and branches (1.865 Kg) were
powdered and extracted with hexane and ethyl acetate by
maceration at room temperature. The extracts were
concentrated under vacuum to yield the residues A (6.1 g),
and B (10.4 g) from the leaves, C (4.8 g) and D (20.7 g)
from the branches, respectively, with hexane and ethyl
acetate. The residues B and D were dissolved in H
2
O/
CH
3
OH (1:1) and extracted with hexane/diethyl ether (1:1).
These solvents were removed under vacuum and the
hexane/diethyl ether fractions (B-1, 0.8 g) and (D-1, 3.5 g)
were successively filtered on sephadex LH-20 column using
methanol as mobile phase. The collected fractions of B-1
(28 fractions, 50 ml) and D-1 (25 fractions, 50 ml) were
analyzed by silica gel TLC. Fractions 15-17 of the B-1
gave biflavonoid 4’,5,7-trihydroxy-flavone-(3’→O→4’”)-
5”,7”-dihydroxyflavanone [2, 40 mg, m.p. 220 ºC, [a]
D
20 +
1.8 (Me

CO, c = 0.33)]; fractions 20-24 yielded a mixture
of chalcones isoliquiritigenin (3) and 3’-hydroxy-
isoliquiritigenin (4) (20 mg, gum). The fractions collected
from the column of D-1 have impure compound 1 which
were crystallized in acetone/ethyl acetate do yield pure
compound 1 (yellow crystals, 300 mg, mp 172 ºC). Product
1a (yellow crystals, 50 mg, mp 168 ºC) was obtained by
treating a methanol solution of 1 (50 mg) with ethereal
diazomethane. The residue C was dissolved in methanol
and successively submitted to column chromatography of
sephadex LH-20 using methanol as mobile phase. Fraction
C-10/14 yielded steroids mixture, sitosterol and
stigmasterol (50 mg); fractions C-18/19 and C-22/27 gave
the triterpene lupeol (20 mg, mp 202 ºC) and betulinic
acid (30 mg, mp 295 ºC), respectively.

Results and Discussion
The known natural compounds β-sitosterol,
stigmasterol,10,11 lupeol,12 betulinic acid,13 isoliquiritigenin
(3),8 3-hydroxy-isoliquiritigenin (4)9 and 4’,5,7-
trihydroxy-flavone-(3’→O→4’”)-5”,7”-dihydroxy-
flavanone (2)4,14 were identified mainly by 1H and 13C-
NMR spectral analyses besides comparison with literature
data.4,5,8-14
Compound 1 gave a positive test with AlCl
3
-EtOH
reagent, which confirmed the presence of a flavonoid. The
IR spectrum showed bands at 3497 (ν
O-H
), 1630 (ν
C=O
) and
1510, 1432 cm-1 attributed to aromatic ring. The 1D and
2D 1H NMR spectra showed signals of three ABC systems,
δ 6.34 (d, 1H), 6.36 (d, 1H), 6.46 (dd, 2H), 8.10 (d, 2H) and
7.09 (d, 1H), 7.57 (dd, 1H) and 7.69 (d, 1H) and signals of
148 Carvalho et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
AA’BB’ at δ 7.00 (d, 2H) and 7.84 (d, 2H) of four aromatic
rings. The additional signal at δ 13.58 (s, 2H) of two chelated
hydroxyls and a multiplet at δ 7.83 and 7.85 for hydrogens
connected at a and β carbons [(δ
CH
 117.2 and 143.2 as
observed in the 1H,13C-COSY (1J
CH
)] spectra, besides the
δ
C=O 
at 192.4, allowed to propose the chalcone structure
(Table 1). These data and 13C NMR (PND and DEPT) and
1H, 13C-COSY (nJ
CH
 n = 1,2,3) spectra analysis were in
agreement with two chalcones reported in the literature,
isoliquiritigenin (3)8 and 3-hydroxy-isoliquiritigenin (4).9
Treatment of 1 with diazomethane yielded 1a with three
methoxy groups, besides two chelated hydroxy groups
(Table 1). These information allowed us to propose the
structure of a new bichalcone 4,2’,4’,2’”,4’”-
pentahydroxy-3→O→4”-bichalcone (1, named as
luxenchalcone) (Table 1). The C-3-O-C-4” connection
between the chalcone moieties was confirmed by a NOESY
and NOEDIFF experiment of the derivative 1a. Irradiation
at the methoxy groups showed NOE at δ 7.06 (d, 8.4 Hz,
H-5), and at signals near δ 6.40 (H-3’, H-5’, H-3’”, H-5’”).
These experiments did not show NOE at δ 7.43 (d, H-2)
and 6.97 (d, H-3”, H-5”). This result indicates that the
positions 3 and 4” are not substituted with OCH
3
 groups.
The 2D experiments [1H,1H-COSY, 1H,13C-COSY
(HETCOR and COLOC of 1 and HMQC and HMBC of
1a)] were used to confirm the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of
1 and 1a (Table 1). The cross peaks observed in the HMBC
spectra of 1a show long-range couplings of C-4 (δ
C
 153.8)
with OCH
3
 (δ 3.88), with H-2 and with H-6 (3J
CH
) and also
of C-3 (δ
C
 144.0) with H-2 (2J
CH
) and H-5 (3J
CH
) which were
used to confirm the C-3-O-C-4” connection. The peaks at
m/z 552 (M+•, 33%, C
33
H
28
O
8
) in the LREIMS of 1a and the
m/z 510.0584 (M+•, 15%; C
30
H
22
O

requires 510.13147) in
the HRESIMS of 1 were also used to confirm the proposed
structure of this new bichalcone.
