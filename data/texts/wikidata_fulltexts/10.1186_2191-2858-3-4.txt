Mohammad Faheem Khan, Nisha Negi, Rajnikant Sharma and Devendra Singh Negi*Abstract
Background: Glycosmis is a genus of evergreen glabrous shrub and distributed all over India. It possesses various
medicinal properties and is used in indigenous medicine for cough, rheumatism, anemia, and jaundice. Glycosmis
arborea is a rich source of alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins, as well as flavonoids.
Results: The chemical investigation of methanol fraction of the leaves of G. arborea led to the isolation of one new
flavone C-glycoside along with three known flavanoids, named as 5,7-dihydroxy-2-[4-hydroxy-3-(methoxy methyl)
phenyl]-6-C-β-D-glucopyranosyl flavone (4), 5,7,40-trihydroxy-30-methoxy flavone (1), 5,40-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-7-O-β-
D-glucupyranosyl flavanone (2), and 5,40-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-7-O-(α-L-rhamnosyl-(1‴→6‴)-β-D-glucopyranosyl)
flavanone (3), respectively. The structures of all compounds were elucidated with the help of nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometry. Pure compounds and fractions were evaluated for pest antifeedant and antimicrobial
activity.
Conclusion: Four compounds were isolated from the leaves of G. arborea. Among them, compound 4 showed
significant antimicrobial activity.

Glycosmis is a genus of evergreen glabrous shrub, distri-
buted in warm and temperate regions of the world, and is a
rich source of alkaloids and amide; however, terpenoids,
coumarins, and flavonoids were also reported [1,2]. Previ-
ously, a new carbazole alkaloid, designated as glycoborinine,
was isolated from the roots of Glycosmis arborea, along
with two known alkaloids, carbazole glycozoline and
glycozolidine, and two known quinoline alkaloids, viz.
skimianine and 3-(30,30-dimethylallyl)-4,8-dimethoxy-N-
methylquinolin-2-one [3]. There are about 60 species in the
Indo-Malaysia region, and 7 are found in India. In
Uttarakhand, G. arborea (Hindi-Ban Nimbu, Sanskrit-
Ashvashokta) grows commonly in Sal and miscellaneous
forests of Tarai Bhabher at 600-m heights [4].
As a part of our ongoing studies aimed at the phyto-
chemical and pharmacological characterization of this
plant, we found that hexane and methanol fractions of the
ethanol extract of G. arborea leaves showed significant
antifeedant and antimicrobial activity. Herein, therefore,
we decided to carry out a detailed study to investigate the
chemical composition of G. arborea. In particular, we* Correspondence: devendra_negi@yahoo.com

in any medium, provided the original work is preport the isolation and characterization of one new
flavone C-glycoside (4) along with three known com-
pounds (1 to 3) (Figure 1) with their antifeedant and
antimicrobial activities. The known compounds were
identified by using spectroscopic methods including
infrared (IR), UV, mass, and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) analysis and also by comparing data
already reported in the literature. Methanol fraction yielded
one new flavone C-glycoside (4) and three known
compounds viz. 5,7,40-trihydroxy-30-methoxy flavone (1)
[5], 5,50-dihydroxy-40-methoxy-7-O-β-D-glucupyranosyl
flavanone (2) [6], and 5,50-dihydroxy-40-methoxy-7-O-
(L-rhamnosyl-(1‴→6‴)-β-D-glucopyranosyl) flavanone
(3) [7]. Among these, compounds 1 and 2 have been
reported for the first time from G. arborea.Methods

The G. arborea leaves were collected from Rajaji National
Park, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India during the flowering
season and identified by a taxonomist of the Botany
Department of HNB Garhwal University Uttarakhand. A

Parts of the dried leaves of G. arborea (1.8 kg) were air
dried, grinded, and refluxed with 90% ethanol. The total
ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pres-
sure at a temperature below 50°C to a dark green vis-
cous mass coded as F001 (120 g) that was partitioned
with hexane (F003) (21 g) and n-butanol F004 (88 g).
The n-butanol soluble layer was then successfully
fractionated into chloroform (4 g) (F005), ethyl
acetate (19 g) (F006), and methanol soluble fraction
(63 g) (F007). The methanol soluble fraction (F007)
after removal of the solvent was chromatographed
over silica gel (800 g) and eluted with mixtures of
CHCl3/MeOH as eluents to give four fractions A1 to A4
(9:1, 88:12, 85:15, 82:18). Fraction A2 (2.4 g) was
rechromatographed on silica gel with CHCl3/MeOH
mixtures (9:1, 85:15) and yielded compounds 1 (70 mg), 2
(90 mg), 3 (46 mg), and 4 (36 mg).

Antifeedant assay
The antifeedant activity of the extracts against the
polyphagous pest Spodoptera litura was tested using the
leaf dip method [7]. Five percent concentrations of each
extract were prepared by dissolving extracts in a small
quantity of ethanol and diluting in water containing
0.05% Triton X-100. The leaf discs of about 5 cm2 were
prepared out of castor leaf (Ricinus communis L.) and
were dipped for 30 s in an extract or compound separ-
ately. The leaf discs dipped only in water containing
0.05% Triton X-100 were used as controls. The leaf discs
were air dried, and on each treated leaf disc, 10 larvae of
S. litura (1 day old) were released. Three replications
were maintained for each extract. Larval weight was
taken after 4 days of treatment. Antifeedant activity of
fractions and the purified compounds were tested
against the polyphagous crop pest S. litura (Table 2).
Antibacterial assay
The in vitro antibacterial activity was tested by the disc
diffusion method [8] using pathogenic strains of
Agrobacterium tumifaciens, Pseudomonas syringae, and
Pectobacterium. carotovorum. Concentrations of 200 and
500 μg/disc of compounds were impregnated on the
discs. These discs were placed on the surface of the agar
plates already inoculated with pathogenic bacteria. The
plates were incubated at 37°C and examined at 48 h for
zone of inhibition, if any, around the discs. Gentamicin
was used in the assay as a standard control drug. An
additional control disc without any sample but impreg-
nated with an equivalent amount of solvent (DMSO)was also used in the assay. The result of antibacterial
activity indicated that methanol fraction and compound
4 exhibited a mild to moderate activity (Table 3).
Results and discussion
Chemistry
The repeated chromatography of methanol fraction of
the leaves of G. arborea led to the isolation of four
flavonoids by gradient elution with the CHCl3/MeOH
mixture of increasing polarity. Compound 4 was isolated
as a yellow solid which was further crystallized in acetone.

http://www.orgmedchemlett.com/content/3/1/4It had the composition C23H24O11 (m/z = 476) as derived
from the positive mode of electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESIMS) analysis. A positive Shinoda test
and color reaction with ferric chloride suggested the
presence of free phenolic hydroxyl groups. The UV
spectrum exhibited absorption maxima at 208 and 306
nm which are characteristic of a flavone skeleton [9]. Its
IR spectrum showed the presence of a hydroxyl group at
3,437 cm−1 and a chelated carbon at 1,660 cm−1 (γ pyrone
nucleus) along with other absorption bands at 1,590 and
838 cm−1, a characteristic of an aromatic nucleus.
The 1H NMR spectrum showed the signals typical for fla-
vone moiety. A double doublet at δ 8.02 (J = 2.4, 8.4 Hz)
and doublet at 6.88 (J = 2.4 Hz) and in the aromatic region
with meta-coupling were assigned to H-20 and H-60.
Another doublet at δ 7.92 (J = 8.4 Hz) was attributed
to H-30 proton. Two sharp singlets at δ 6.77 and 6.26
were ascribed as H-3 and H-8, respectively. The
downfield chemical shift at δ 13.15 was assigned to
the hydroxyl proton of OH-5. A sharp peak resonated
at δ 3.8 due to the methoxy proton. 1H spectra showed up-
field signal at δ 3.15 for two protons attributed to aliphatic
methylene H-1‴. The 13C NMR spectra showed the signals
for 23 carbons which were differentiated into 10 methines,
2 methylenes, 1 methyl, and 10 quaternary carbons on the
basis of distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer
(DEPT; 90 and 135) experiments. DEPT 135 revealed the
presence of two methylene carbons in a molecule
resonating at δ 61.65 and 48.97 assigned to C-60 and
C-1‴. From 1H spectra, two doublets of one proton
resonated at δ 4.65 and 3.75 assigned to H-1″ (J = 9.9 Hz,
anomeric) and H-6″a. Two doublet of doublets of one
proton at δ 3.82 (J = 9.2, 9.9 Hz) and 3.52 (J = 12 Hz) were
attributed to H-2″ and H-6″b. A multiplet at δ 3.22 to
3.34 showed for the remaining three sugar protons.
The exact proton and carbon assignments were made by
a combination of 2D NMR experiments such as COSY,
heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC), and
heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC). The
position of sugar was confirmed by HMBC long-range
correlation in which anomeric H-1″ showed long-range
coupling with 162.97 (C-5), 104.97 (C-6), and 156.3 (C-7),
suggesting the position of sugar at C-6 of aromatic ring B
(Figure 2). The double bond position was confirmed bycoupling of a proton singlet (δ 6.77) with 182.47 (C-4) and
121.98 (C-10), suggesting that it must be placed at C-3 and
assigned as H-3. The 5-hydroxy flavone skeleton was
assigned on the basis of 13C NMR data which showed C-4
resonance at δ 182.47, characteristic of 5-hydroxy flavone
[10,11]. The signal resonating at δ 56.8 was due to methoxy
carbon. The upfield appearance of anomeric carbon (73.74)
and proton (4.65) as compared to those of aromatic
O-glycoside data and anomeric proton correlation
with C-5, C-6, and C-7 in the long-range HMBC experi-
ment exhibited its C-glycosidic nature which was
confirmed by its resistance to acidic hydrolysis [12,13]. The
remaining HMBC correlations are given in Table 1.
The structure was supported by the mass spectro-
scopic studies, which showed molecular ion peak at 478
m/z [M++2H]. Fragment at 445 m/z was due to loss of
carbonyl [M+-CO] and further at 433 m/z was due to loss
of the methyl group [M+-CO-CH3]. A higher percentage of
fragmentation also appeared at 455 m/z [M+-H2O-3H].
Thus, compound 4 was unambiguously identified as 5,7-
dihydroxy-2-[4-hydroxy-3-(methoxymethyl) phenyl]-6-C-
β-D-glucopyranosyl flavone, a new flavone C-glycoside
named as Arboreaside.
Biological studies
Antifeedant activity
All the fractions and compounds were tested for anti-
feedant activity. Among them, the hexane and methanol
fractions showed significant antifeedant action against S.
litura L. In a dual-choice leaf disc method, hexane and
methanol fractions were tested for pesticidal potential.
Khan et al. Organic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2013, 3:4 Page 5 of 5
http://www.orgmedchemlett.com/content/3/1/4The hexane fraction showed a percent feeding index
(PFI) of 46.71 ± 4.07, while the methanol fraction
showed a PFI of 50.21 ± 5.01 as given in Table 2.
Antibacterial activity
All the fractions and compounds were also tested for anti-
bacterial activity. The methanol fraction and compound 4
showed antimicrobial activity against the plant bacterial
pathogens A. tumifaciens, P. syringae, and P. carotovorum.
It was found that moderate inhibitory activities were ob-
served against A. tumifaciens and P. carotovorum at a con-
centration of 200 μg, whereas P. syringae was found to be
fatal at 500 μg. Compound 4 showed moderate inhibition
against A. tumifaciens as shown in the Table 3.
Experimental
All melting points are uncorrected and were taken in open
capillaries. The UV spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 15 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) in methanol as blank. IR spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer Infrared 15 in KBr pellets and
are expressed per centimeter. The 1H and 13C NMR
were scanned on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz (Bruker
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) at C5D5N-d5, DMSO-d6,
CD3OD, and CDCl3 at 400, 300, and 100 MHz with TMS
as internal reference. Proton-detected heteronuclear
correlations were measured using HMQC (optimized
for JHC =14.5 Hz) and HMBC (optimized for JHC =7 Hz).
Mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass Quattro II
(Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, UK) at 70 eV for ESIMS.
Column chromatography was carried out using silica
gel (60 to 120 mesh, Qualigen (Carlsbad, CA, USA)/
Merck (Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA)). Thin layer chroma-
tography was carried out over plates made of silica gel G of
Qualigen/Merck.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present paper has shown the isolation
and structure elucidation of one new flavone C-glycoside
(4) along with three known compounds (1 to 3) from
methanol fraction of G. arborea leaves. With regard to
bioactivity, all fractions and isolated compounds were
evaluated for antifeedant and antibacterial activity. Among
them, hexane and methanol fractions showed antifeedant
activity, whereas methanol fraction and compound 4
showed significant antibacterial activity.
