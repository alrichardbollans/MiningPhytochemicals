Caffeic acid oligomers such as rosmarinic acid and lithos-permic acid B (LAB) are distributed in plants of Labiataeand Boraginaceae. Among these oligomers, LAB, the caffeicacid tetramer, has a variety of attractive pharmacological ac-tivities such as antioxidant and radical scavenging,1,2) im-provement of renal disease,3—6) hypotensive,7—9) improve-ment of myocardial infarction,1,10) amplification of beating ofmyocardial muscles,11) anti-hepatitis,12) and aldose reductaseinhibitory activity.13) To utilize LAB as a medicinal resource,more than 30 plant sources were surveyed and only two med-icinal plants, Salvia officinalis and Lithospermum erythrorhi-zon SIEB. et ZUCC, were found to contain this substance in anappreciable amount.14) Many attempts to produce this com-pound in high quantities using cell or hairy root cultures havebeen unsuccessful.15—22)Recently, we found that L. erythrorhizon cell-suspensioncultures, which were established for the industrial productionof shikonin,23) produced four caffeic acid oligomers, ros-marinic acid, LAB, a monoglucoside of LAB, and (1)-rab-dosiin.24) In particular, the production of LAB in the culturedcells was highly stimulated in shikonin production mediumM-9,25) reaching almost the same amount as that of shikonin(LAB: ca. 6—10% of dry wt, and total shikonin derivatives:ca. 6—12% of dry wt.).24,26) Since both LAB and shikoninare formed through a common phenylpropanoid pathway(Chart 1), the counterbalance between two metabolic routeseither to LAB or to shikonin would be regulated in L. ery-throrhizon cells, suggesting that the selection of suitable reg-ulatory factors would result in higher production of LAB.However, the metabolic linkage and the regulatory mecha-nism for the biosyntheses of phenylpropanoid-derived com-pounds of diverse types in L. erythrorhizon cell cultures re-main to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the criticalregulatory factors to control these two biosynthetic pathwaysseparately and to produce LAB efficiently in the culture sys-tem of L. erythrorhizon.ExperimentalCell Cultures The culture strain M18TOM24) of Lithospermum ery-throrhizon, which had been maintained in Linsmaier-Skoog (LS) medium27)containing IAA 1 mM and kinetin 10 mM, was used in the present study. Cell-suspension cultures in 100-ml flasks each containing 30 ml of medium wereagitated on a rotary shaker (80 rpm) at 23 °C in the dark and subcultured atintervals of 2 weeks. The cells cultured in LS medium for 2 weeks were in-oculated into M-9 medium,25) modified M-9 or LS media containing 3% su-crose, and the same growth regulators as above (inoculum size: 1 g of freshcells/30 ml of medium in a 100-ml flask) and cultured for 3 weeks under theabove-mentioned culture conditions. For the investigation of the effect oflight color on the production of secondary metabolites, each flask was cov-ered with a commercially available colored cellophane sheet,28) and irradi-ated with white light (10000 lx) from fluorescent lamps during the entire cul-ture period. Under such conditions, light intensities in blue, red, and greencellophane-covered flasks were 600, 1000, and 900 lx, respectively.Quantitative Analysis of Secondary Metabolites Sample preparationsand quantitative analyses of secondary metabolites were carried out accord-ing to the methods described in the previous report,26) and the sum of con-tents of b-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin, acetylshikonin, isobutylshikonin, b ,b-dimethylacrylshikonin, isovalerylshikonin, and a-methyl-n-butylshikoninwas expressed as shikonin. In addition to shikonin and caffeic acidoligomers, L. erythrorhizon cells produced several phenylpropanoid-derivedsecondary metabolites, including p-hydroxybenzoic acid 1-O-glucoside(PHBOG),29,30) furobenzoquinone and furohydroquinone derivatives such asechinofurans B and C,31) dihydroechinofuran,32) deoxyshikonofuran, andshikonofuran E,33) all of which were biosynthesized from p-hydroxybenzoicacid (PHB). In the present study, we determined the contents of all thesecompounds and found that the total content of furobenzoquinone and furo-hydroquinone derivatives was within about 10% of that of shikonin. Thecontents of caffeic acid oligomers, rosmarinic acid, LAB monoglucoside,and (1)-rabdosiin were also low compared with that of LAB, and were notaffected by the supplements of modulators used. Therefore the contents ofthese compounds are not given in the Results section.ResultsTime Course of Secondary Metabolite ProductionFigure 1 shows the time courses of cell growth and produc-tion of phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites in L.erythrorhizon cells cultured in LS medium (A) and M-9medium (B).

Various culture factors for increasing the production of lithospermic acid B were investigated.Lithospermic acid B production was inhibited by 2,4-D or NH41, whereas it was stimulated by Cu21. These regu-latory patterns were similar to those for the production of shikonin derivatives in these cell cultures, suggestive ofclose relations and similar metabolic regulation between the production of these compounds. Cultivation underlight illumination, however, showed that these metabolisms were independently regulated. In particular, bluelight showed a stimulatory effect on lithospermic acid B production, while shikonin production was strongly in-hibited, indicative of an effective condition for lithospermic acid B production.Key words Lithospermum erythrorhizon; plant cell culture; lithospermic acid B; shikonin; light; nitrogen source1086 Chem.

In M-9 medium, LAB production increasedrapidly after inoculation and resulted in a linear increase to-ward the end of the culture period, reaching 10 mg/g freshwt. on day 21 (Fig. 1B). Unlike the production pattern ofLAB, the production of shikonin needed a lag phase of 4 dafter inoculation and the level reached 9 mg/g fresh wt. onday 21. The production of PHBOG was inversely propor-tional to that of shikonin, and only a trace amount ofPHBOG was detectable to the end of the culture period.Effects of Chemical Modulators in Shikonin Produc-tion on LAB Production A number of modulators inshikonin production have been revealed in extensive studiesmade so far (for a recent review see ref. 34). In particular,shikonin production is clearly enhanced by the supplementa-tion of Cu21,35) but strongly inhibited by either NH41 25,36) or2,4-D.37) We examined the effects of such shikonin produc-tion modulators on LAB production. As shown in Fig. 2,contrary to our expectations, 2,4-D and NH41, strong in-hibitors of shikonin production, also inhibited LAB produc-August 2002 1087Chart 1.

At 2,4-D1 mM or at NH41 1 mM at which shikonin production was com-pletely inhibited, the LAB level declined to that in LSmedium-cultured cells. Under these culture conditions, thelevel of PHBOG was restored to that in the cells cultured inLS medium (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the supplementa-tion of Cu21, a potent stimulator of shikonin production, alsostimulated the production of LAB. Figure 3 shows the effectof added Cu21 on LAB production in Cu21-free M-9medium. Both LAB and shikonin production was enhancedby the addition of Cu21. However, the LAB level nearlyreached a plateau at concentrations higher than Cu21 1 mM,whereas shikonin production was stimulated up to Cu2110 mM in a dose-dependent manner.LAB production was also affected by the NO32 concentra-tion. When nitrogen sources in LS medium were replacedwith NO32, lower concentrations of NO32 tended to result inmore LAB production (data not shown). This effect was rein-forced by the addition of Cu21 1.2 mM (Fig. 4). At NO326.7 mM and Cu21 1.2 mM, the amount of LAB reached to 71%(5.3 mg/g fresh wt.) of that in M-9 medium cells. On theother hand, only a trace amount of shikonin production(0.2 mg/g fresh wt., 3% of that in M-9 medium) was ob-served under the same conditions.PO432, which influences the production of many secondarymetabolites including polyphenols in plant cell cultures,38—40)did not affect the production of LAB and shikonin in L. ery-throrhizon cells cultured in either LS or M-9 medium (rang-ing from 0.12 to 1.25 mM, data not shown).Effect of Light on LAB Production Light is a physio-logical regulatory element in shikonin biosynthesis. White orblue light strongly inhibits shikonin production by suppress-ing the gene expression of PHB geranyltransferase, a key en-zyme in shikonin biosynthesis,41,42) as well as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an en-zyme responsible for the formation of the geranyl side chainof shikonin.43) As shown in Fig. 5, LAB production wasslightly stimulated by white light irradiation compared withthat in cells cultured in the dark, whereas shikonin produc-tion was completely inhibited. It was noteworthy that cultiva-tion under white light irradiation resulted in a high accumu-lation of PHBOG (7.4 mg/g fresh wt.), which was aboutequal to that of shikonin in the dark-grown controls (8.9mg/g fresh wt.). When the cells were cultured under bluelight, PHBOG was only 2.5 mg/g fresh wt., whereas the LABcontent reached 12.1 mg/g fresh wt. (170% of the dark-grown controls). LAB production was also stimulated underred or green light (157% and 156% of the dark-grown con-trols, respectively). Under these conditions, shikonin produc-tion was not as inhibited (69% and 55% of the dark-growncontrols, respectively), and the PHBOG content remained ata low level.DiscussionIt is well known that shikonin derivatives are produced onindustrial scale from L. erythrorhizon cell cultures.23) In thepresent study, we demonstrated that LAB was produced al-most specifically in a higher yield than that of shikonin,which was achieved by cultivation in the dark, in L. ery-throrhizon cells by cultivation under blue light irradiation.It has been demonstrated that the enzyme susceptible to1088 Vol. 50, No. 8Fig. 3.

No shikonin in cells culturedunder white or blue light was produced. This led us to expectthat the exclusive utilization of the phenylpropanoid unitunder light irradiation could lead to higher production ofLAB. To assess this assumption, the efficiency of utilizationof the phenylpropanoid unit in either LAB or shikoninbiosynthesis and in PHBOG formation was stoichiometri-cally analyzed in L. erythrorhizon cells cultured under thedifferent light conditions (Fig. 6). Light irradiation did notincrease the production of the phenylpropanoid unit but ledto increased production of caffeic acid derivatives. The pro-duction of LAB was less affected by white light, althoughgreater accumulation of PHBOG was observed. Meanwhile,cultivation under blue light illumination increased the flow ofthe phenylpropanoid unit into the formation of LAB, presum-ably owing to the inhibition of PHB geranyltransferase andthe low activity of PHB glucosyltransferase.44) PHB, whichwas assumed to be cytotoxic,45) was not detectable under anyculture conditions employed in the present study, as reportedin previous papers.32,33) There might be a negative feedbackregulation in the supply of PHB as a biosynthetic intermedi-ate, although the conversion of 4-coumaric acid to PHB hasnot yet been completely clarified.46,47)Under red or green light irradiation, LAB production wasalso stimulated but shikonin production was not completelyinhibited (Fig. 5). These results might indicate that lightqualities regulate LAB formation in different manners andalso have independent effects on the biosynthesis of bothcompounds in L. erythrorhizon cells. The stimulation of 4-coumarate CoA : ligase expression by light in L. erythrorhi-zon cells48) may also contribute to the increase in LAB pro-duction, because this enzyme is responsible for LAB biosyn-thesis (Chart 1).The inhibitory effects of 2,4-D and NH41 as well as thestimulatory effect of Cu21 on LAB and shikonin productionwere also demonstrated in this study (Figs. 2, 3). These datasuggest that common earlier steps in the biosynthetic path-ways of shikonin and LAB are controlled by similar regula-tion mechanisms. Cells cultured in modified LS mediumcontaining nitrate and Cu21 at the same concentrations asthose in M-9 medium (NO32 6.7 mM and Cu21 1.2 mM) pro-duced some LAB (ca. 70% of that observed in M-9medium), while they resulted in the poor production ofshikonin (3% of the yield in M-9 medium) (Fig. 4). These re-sults suggest that nitrate and Cu21 stimulate the productionof LAB but not of shikonin. Thus we have found an effective,although not yet sufficient, condition for high production ofLAB. On the other hand, the production of (1)-rabdosiin, an-other caffeic acid tetramer presumably formed from ros-marinic acid like LAB (see Chart 1)26) was almost unaffectedby the modulators connected with LAB production (data notshown). In intact L. erythrorhizon plants, LAB is mostly ac-cumulated in the main roots whereas (1)-rabdosiin is mainlyfound in the aerial parts as well as in fibrous roots.26) The dif-ferent distribution pattern of these two caffeic acid tetramersin intact plants might result in the different response to theabove modulators in cultured cells. Further investigation ofculture components as well as further biochemical and mole-cular biological studies on the enzymes responsible for LABbiosynthesis will contribute to more effective production ofLAB in this cell culture.Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by grants fromthe Nagasaki Advanced Technology Development Council, Nagasaki, Japan.References1) Fung K.
