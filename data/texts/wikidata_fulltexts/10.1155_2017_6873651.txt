The onion landraces were harvested at the end of the growth cycle corresponding to the ripening time andharvest month, respectively: February, March, April, May, and June. The total content of volatile compounds as well as the sulfur-containing compounds in Aprilatica was significantly (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) higher than the other landraces investigated. The nutraceuticalfeature investigated through the total phenols, phenols profile, and antioxidant activity showed higher values for the samplesharvested in spring months. High pungency values ranging from 9 to 14 𝜇mol/g FWwere found in all onion landraces investigatedas enzymatically (alliinase) produced pyruvate (EPY). The organic acids profile (malic, citric, succinic, pyruvic, oxalic, ascorbic,and tartaric acids) highlighted malic and citric acids in higher amounts in all landraces. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose were foundas soluble sugars and fructose was the most abundant. Generally, the results highlighted the growth temperature influence on theinvestigated quality parameters.1. IntroductionOnion (Allium cepa L.) is the most widely cultivated speciesof the genus Allium [1].The plant portion commonly used is the bulb, which isutilized as a food ingredient to give flavour and aroma to agreat variety of dishes.Onions are an important source of several phytonutrientsas flavonoids, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and thiosulfi-nates and other sulfur compounds, recognized as importantelements of the Mediterranean diet [2].In fact, onions contain high levels of phenolic com-pounds, which have antioxidant properties besides beneficialeffects against different degenerative pathologies (cardiovas-cular and neurological diseases, dysfunctions based on oxida-tive stress) [3].Flavonoids are the major phenolics in onions, whichcan be classified to different subclasses (flavones, flavanones,flavonols, isoflavones, flavanonols, flavanols, chalcones, andanthocyanins) on the basis of the degree of unsaturation andthe degree of oxidation of the central ring. Flavonoids sub-classes can be further differentiated on the basis of the num-ber and nature of substituent groups attached to the rings [4].Flavonols are the most abundant in onions, present astheir glycosides, that is, quercetin and kaempferol [5, 6], inhigher concentration (280–400mg/kg) than other vegetables(i.e., 100mg/kg in broccoli, 50mg/kg in apple) [7]. Antho-cyanins, belonging to anthocyanidins, are mainly present inred onions (250mg/kg), besides having a composition rich inflavonols as yellow onions [7].FOS represent another source of phytochemicals in on-ions bulbs.They are mainly inulin, kestose, nystose, and fruc-tofuranosylnystose. The health benefits of these carbohy-drates have been widely reported in the past years due to theirprebiotic effect [8].HindawiJournal of Food QualityVolume 2017, Article ID 6873651, 9 pageshttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/68736512 Journal of Food QualityIn onions, sulfur compounds are responsible for typicalodour and flavour and are also active antimicrobial agents [9];hence, onions may be used as natural preservatives to controlmicrobial growth [10]. Furthermore, they have also protectiveeffects against cardiovascular diseases.The precursors of sulfur-containing compounds are S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides (ACSOs, i.e., methiin, propi-in, and isoalliin) which are hydrolysed by means of alliinaseenzyme into pyruvate, ammonia, and a mixture of both vola-tile and nonvolatile sulfur compounds [11], after the breakageof the tissue caused by cutting, mastication, and cooking.The concentration of pyruvate produced by alliinaseactivity allows assessing the pungency of onions [12, 13]. Themajor flavour compounds are generated by spontaneous reac-tions of the sulfenic acids. These latter undergo rearrange-ment to form a mixture of sulfur-containing compounds(S-compounds) including thiosulfinates, thiosulfonates, andmono-, di-, and trisulfides as well as specific compounds suchas thiopropanal S-oxide, the lachrymatory or tear factor, allresponsible for the typical flavour of onions [3].The bioaccumulation of organosulfur compounds in on-ions depends on different factors but especially on the sulfur-based fertilization, the environment, and the genotype ofthe cultivars [14–16]. Also, other compounds such as organicacids and sugars can contribute to the sensory profile ofonions. Hence, organic acids influence the acidity and pH ofthe onion juice in a larger or smaller degree; the soluble sugarsinfluence the sweetness of onions and hence the acceptabilityof this vegetable by consumers. In fact, there is increasinginterest in the role that some nonstructural carbohydratesplay in the taste preference [17].Onion (Allium cepa L.) is an Allium vegetable widely cul-tivated in Campania region (South Italy), in particular inthe two contiguous areas of Nocerino-Sarnese and Stabiese-Vesuvius plains, where Bianca di Pompei cultivar is mostlypresent. This cultivar is actually composed of a set of locallynamed landraces, all sharing common shapes and colours(white-greenish flattened bulbs). The landraces differ mainlyin the bulb harvest time that is a function of the end of thegrowth cycle and so of the ripening time; the latter rangesfrom February to June. In this way, the farmer can supply afresh product for a long time on the market, avoiding prob-lems and costs due to the preservation [18]. The aim of thispaper was to characterize different onion landraces belongingto Bianca di Pompei cv in terms of main quality parametersfor this crop (volatile compounds, organic acids, sugars,polyphenols, antioxidant activity, and pungency).2. Materials and Methods2.1. Onion Samples. Raw onions (Allium cepa, Bianca diPompei cv) were supplied by factories located in the Salernoarea (Campania region, Italy). White onion landraces wereharvested at the end of the growth cycle and classifiedaccording to the harvest month: Febbrarese, Marzatica, Apri-latica, Maggiaiola, and Giugnese reaped in February, March,April, May, and June, respectively. The production of the fivewhite onion landraces was carried out using the conventionalcultivation methods for this crop. The bulbs were storedin the dark at 7∘C for a maximum of 5 days before analy-sis.2.2. Chemicals. Analytical grade chemicals, methanol, di-chloromethane, trichloroacetic acid, acetic acid, acetonitrile,sodium hydroxide, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, gallic acid, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), dinitrophenyl hydrazine(DNPH), quercetin, kaempferol, 2-octanol, sodium sulfate,and ferulic and chlorogenic acids, were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).2.3. Extraction of Volatile Compounds. One hundred gramsof edible part of onion samples was homogenized in anUltra-Turrax blender (T25, IKA Werke, Staufen, Germany)at room temperature. The slurry was transferred into theflask with 300mL of distilled water and 1 𝜇L of 2-octanol, asinternal standard, and sonicated at 50Hz for 30 minutes. Icewas added to the ultrasonic bath (Sonica 22000 MH, Soltec,Italy) to avoid matrix heating phenomena. The slurry wassubjected to steam distillation by a vertical steam distillationunit.The flask containing the homogenized onion was heatedfor 3 h and the condensed vapour was extracted with freshdichloromethane 3 times by separatory funnel. The organicphases were collected, dehydrated with anhydrous Na2SO4,filtered through Whatman filter paper, and finally concen-trated using a Kuderna-Danish device.2.4. GC-MS Analysis. The volatile compounds were deter-mined by GC-MS (Trace MS plus, Thermo Finnigan, USA)and by GC-FID (HP 6890, Agilent), both equipped with acapillary column (SUPELCOWAX 10; 60m, 0.25mm, and0.25 𝜇m, Supelco, USA). Chromatographic separation wasperformed on 2 𝜇L of sample, using helium as carrying gas atconstant flow of 1mL/min. The temperature program was asfollows: 3min at 40∘C, first ramp at 2∘C/min to 150∘C, secondramp at 4∘C/min to 220∘C, and 10min at 220∘C.TheGC injec-tor was held at 40∘C for 3min, and the column temperatureprogram increased up to 150∘C at 2∘C/min, from 150∘C to220∘C at 4∘C/min (held for 10min). Detector and transfer linewere held at 250∘C. The identification of volatile compoundswas carried out by injection of commercial standards (Sigma-Aldrich,Milano, Italy), by spectra comparison using theNISTand Wiley libraries, and by comparison of their retentionindices to reference data from the literature. The quantitativeanalyseswere done assuming the response factors equal to the2-octanol, used as internal standard [19].2.5. Polyphenols. 150mL of methanol was added to 50 g offresh onion tissue. The resulting mixture was homogenizedand stirred for 30 minutes; homogenates were held for 15minin an ultrasonic bath (FungilabUltrasound, Barcelona, Spain)and the extract was separated from the residue by centrif-ugation at 1900×g. Extraction was repeated increasing thestirring time to 60min and to 90min. The combined metha-nol : water extracts were filtered through aWhatmanNo. 2 fil-ter paper andwere evaporated at 40∘C (rotary evaporator IKARV-8, Staufen, Germany) to remove methanol. The extractsJournal of Food Quality 3were redissolved in 10mL of methanol [5] and were used forthe determination of polyphenols and antioxidant activity.Total phenols were estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu colouri-metric assay [20] and results were expressed as mg equivalentgallic acid (GAE)/g dry weight. The absorbance of solutionswas read at 765 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer(Lambda Bio 40; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), after 2hours of incubation in the dark.The quali-quantitative profile was determined by HPLC(1100, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) according to Cinquan-ta et al. (2015). The polyphenol extracts were filtered through0.45 𝜇m filter syringe and directly injected into Agilent/HP1100 system (CA, USA). The phenolic compounds wereseparated on SupelcoAscentis RP-AmideColumnsC18 (150×4.6mm; 5 𝜇m) at a flow rate of 1.2mL/min. The mobilephase used was (A) water/acetic acid (99 : 1, v/v) and (B)acetonitrile/acetic acid (99 : 1 v/v), with a gradient as follows:0min, 100%A; 6.5min, 85%A and 15%B; 8.0min, 80%A and20% B; 12min, 75% A and 25% B; 16min, 70% A and 30% B;25min, 60% A and 40% B; 40min, 60% A and 40% B. Theeluates were detected at 280 and 350 nm. The concentrationof identified phenols was calculated with external standardsmethod.2.6. Antioxidant Activity. Antioxidant activity was measuredby 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) solution (6 ⋅ 10−5Min methanol) and the free radical scavenging activity wasexpressed as the EC50 value: the volume (𝜇L) required toreduce 50% of the initial DPPH radical activity. Total antiox-idant activity of pomegranate juice was determined by the1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method [22]. Onionextracts in different concentrationsweremixedwith 6⋅10−5Mmethanol solution of DPPH radical. The mixture was shakenvigorously and left to stand for 30min in the dark at roomtemperature. After the reaction was allowed to take place inthe dark for 30min, the absorbance at 517 nm was recordedto determine the concentration of remaining DPPH.The antioxidant activity was expressed according to Al-banese et al. [23] as percentage inhibition of DPPH and thencalculated according to the following equation:% inhibition of DPPH = [(𝐴𝐶(0) − 𝐴𝑆(𝑡))𝐴𝐶(0) ] ∗ 100, (1)where 𝐴𝐶(0) is the absorbance of the control at 𝑡 = 0min and𝐴𝑆(𝑡) is the absorbance of sample at 𝑡 = 30min. The free rad-ical scavenging activity determined by DPPH was expressedas the EC50 value:mg of the extract permL required to reduce50% of the initial DPPH radical activity.2.7. Pungency Analysis. Pungency of onions was determinedas enzymatically (alliinase) produced pyruvate (EPY) bycolourimetric analysis according to Schwimmer and Weston(1961) with slight modifications. Onion landraces were slicedin half longitudinally: 50 g was homogenized by Ultra-Turraxblender (T25, IKA Werke, Staufen, Germany) with 50mLof distilled water for the determination of total pyruvatealliinase produced, whereas 50 g of onions was pretreatedwith 50mL of 5% trichloroacetic acid solution to inactivatethe alliinase in order to quantify pyruvate basal level. Bothmixtures were left at room temperature for 15min and filteredwith Whatman filter paper (grade 1) and 10mL of the filtratewas diluted ten times with bidistilled water. One millilitreof sample was placed in a reaction tube with 1mL of 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) solution (0.0125% DNPHin 2M HCl) and 1mL of bidistilled water. Reaction tube wasvortexed and placed in a water bath at 37∘C for 10 minutes.After the incubation time, 5mL of 0.6MNaOHwas added tothe tube and allowed to stand for 5min. The DNP hydrazinederivative of pyruvate was measured using PerkinElmerLambda 25 UV-Vis spectrometer at 420 nm. Enzymatically(alliinase) produced pyruvate (EPY) in each sample was cal-culated from the difference of total and basal concentrationof pyruvate. A blank sample was prepared with 2mL of waterand 1mL of DNPH; standards were prepared replacing onionsample with 1mL of sodium pyruvate solution, ranging from20 to 100 𝜇M.2.8. Sugars Analysis. Sugars were determined by HPLC(Hewlett Packard, mod. 79852, USA) [21]. The HPLC systemwas equipped with 4.6 × 250mm (60 Å, 4 𝜇m) carbohydrate-cartridge column (Waters, USA). The mobile phase wasan acetonitrile-water solution (75 : 25), with a flow rate of1.2mL/min and a column temperature of 60∘C. Peaks weredetected by a refractive index detector (Hewlett Packard,mod. 100, USA) and concentrations were calculated withexternal standards method.2.9. Organic Acids Analysis. 1 g of fresh onion was added todistilled water up to 10mL and homogenized in an Ultra-Turrax blender (T25, IKA Werke, Staufen, Germany) for2min. The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10minand filtered through 0.45𝜇m syringe cellulose filter (Milli-pore, USA) before ion exchange chromatography analysis.The apparatus (Dionex Corp., USA) was equipped with anED 500 electrochemical detector, Ionpac AS11 column (250×4mm), and Ionpac AS11 Guard (50 × 4mm). The elutionphase at 0.5mL/min was bidistilled water (E1) and NaOH100mM (E2) for a total running time of 25min, using thefollowing gradient: from 93% E1 at time 0 to 65% E1 at20min and then to 93% E1 in 5min [24]. The organic acidswere identified by the overlapping of their retention timewith those of commercial standard acids prepared from 1 g/Lstock solution and diluted to the required concentrationbefore use. A calibration curve of organic acid standards wasobtained and used for quantitative analysis. Acquisition andintegration of chromatograms were performed with PeaknetG4G1T0 (Dionex Corp.) software.2.10. Statistical Analysis. Analysis of parameters investigatedwas carried out on five different samples belonging to eachonion group. Results were reported as themean and standarddeviation. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied tothe data.The least significant differences were obtained usingan LSD test (𝑝 ≤ 0.05). Statistical analysis was performedusing SPSS version 13.0 forWindows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,USA).4 Journal of Food Quality3. Results and DiscussionA total of 22 compounds (Table 1) were identified in the vol-atile fraction of onion samples belonging to the followingchemical classes: sulfur-containing compounds (S-com-pounds), aldehydes, and ketones.S-compounds were the main volatile compounds of theonion profile [11] which in our study ranged from aminimumof 207.87mg/Kg in Febbrarese landrace to a maximum of1459.40mg/Kg in Aprilatica one, corresponding to 63% and74% of total volatile compounds, respectively. Nine out offifteen S-compounds were di- and trisulfides and were themost numerous. These results were in agreement with Lan-zotti [25] who proved that di- and trisulfides were the maincompounds in the volatile fraction of the onion isolated bysteam distillation. Furthermore, the volatile S-compounds ofBianca di Pompei onion landraces were the typical moleculesof the volatile fraction characterizing the onion’s pungentflavour [26–29]. Other compounds, aldehydes and ketones,were found in a smaller amount ranging between 17–21%and 3–7% of the total volatile compounds, respectively, inlandrace samples.The overall content of volatile compounds seems to beinfluenced by growth cycle and harvest month which is afunction of temperature. Metabolite compositions in onionsare strongly affected by climate conditions, in particular byair temperature [30]. In fact, Febbrarese and Marzatica lan-draces grown and harvested in colder winter months showedlower concentrations of total volatile compounds than thosefound in Aprilatica, Maggiaiola, and Giugnese, which werecharacterized by a milder crop temperature. These threeonion landraces showed a concentration of volatile com-pounds almost five times higher than that in Febbrarese andMarzatica. Likewise, aldehydes, ketones, and S-compoundsincreased from Febbrarese toGiugnese; in particular,Giugneseshowed the highest amounts equal to 395.28 and 133.46mg/kgfor aldehydes and ketones, respectively, while S-compoundscontent was maximum in Aprilatica (1459.40mg/kg).For all the investigated onion landraces, quantitativeanalysis showed that di- and trisulfides, such as cis- andtrans-methyl-1-propenyl disulfide, methyl-2-propenyl disul-fide, dipropyl disulfide, cis- and trans-propenyl propyl disul-fide, methyl propyl trisulfide, and dipropyl trisulfide, werethe largest part, whose sum represents about 60% of S-compounds.Di- and trisulfides increased in landraces harvested inspringmonths (Aprilatica,Maggiaiola, andGiugnese) in com-parison to those detected in Febbrarese and Marzatica lan-draces harvested in colder winter months.According to Lanzotti (2006), di- and trisulfides wereformed by the degradation of thiosulfinates whose biosyn-thetic pathway came from the condensation reactions ofalk(en)yl-sulfenic acids (e.g., Z,E-propanethial S-oxide orlachrymator factor). The amount of alk(en)yl-sulfenic acids(the lachrymator factor) was closely linked to the concen-tration of the aroma precursors: S-alkenyl cysteine sulfoxides(ACSOs).The higher content of di- and trisulfides than othervolatile compounds in onion samples cultivated duringwarmer spring months was probably due to an increase ofS-alkenyl cysteine sulfoxides (ACSOs), according to Ran-dle and Coolong [31] who proved that growth tempera-ture affected ACSOs concentration of Granex 33 onion. Inparticular, they recorded that ACSO concentrations frombulbs grown at 15.6∘C were roughly a third of those grownat 32.2∘C. Among di- and trisulfide compounds, methylpropyl trisulfide was the most abundant compound forall onion samples investigated, followed by trans-methyl-1-propenyl disulfide. A similar result has been documented byArnault et al. [32] who reported that S-compounds such asthiosulfonates, propyl-containing disulfides and trisulfides,propenyl-containing disulfides and trisulfides, and thiophenederivates mainly contributed to the volatile compounds ofonion.About the aldehydes class, four compoundswere detectedin the volatile pattern of onion samples except for 2-methyl-2-pentenal which was not detected in Febbrarese landrace.Aldehydes content was different (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) for the five onionlandraces investigated and it increased in landraces harvestedfrom February (Febbrarese) to June (Giugnese). Among thealdehydes, furfuraldehyde was the most abundant in allsamples, and its highest content (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) was found inApri-latica landrace. Propionaldehyde and 2-methyl-2-pentenalcontents were different (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) in landraces samples: thehighest values were in Aprilatica landrace, followed by Mag-giaiola and Giugnese. These aldehydes, together with di- andtrisulfide compounds, arose from the lachrymator factor [28,33] as well as the pungency and the overall flavour of onion.The other volatile compounds were two ketones andfurfuryl alcohol (Table 1).The 1,2-cyclopentanedione concen-tration differed at harvest time: in spring months, Aprilatica,Maggiaiola, andGiugnese landraces had a higher content (𝑝 ≤0.05) than those yielded inwinter (Febbrarese andMarzatica).The butyrolactone compound was detected only in landracesharvested in spring months (Aprilatica, Maggiaiola, andGiugnese).Total phenols, quantified in the onion samples, werereported in Table 2. The concentration ranged from a mini-mum of 4.75 in Febbrarese to a maximum of 5.31 in Giugnese.The results were in accordance with Santas et al. (2008) andPrakash et al. (2007) who evaluated white Spanish and red,violet, and green onion varieties, respectively.The onion landraces were also studied for their specificphenols composition (Figure 1 and Table 2). For all landraces,the most abundant phenol was gallic acid, whose quantitychanges from 55.66 to 64.90 𝜇g/g dw in Febbrarese and Giug-nese, respectively. Among identified phenols, quercetin has animportant role from a nutritional point of view. Quercetinis the aglycone form of several other flavonoid glycosidessuch as rutin and quercitrin that are found in citrus fruits,buckwheat, and onions [35]. Functional benefits of querce-tin include anti-inflammatory activity, antihistamine effect,allergy medication, and anticancer and antivirus activities.It has also been claimed to regulate blood pressure inhypertensive subjects [36].In our samples, this flavonol was found to be between 6.98and 8.14 𝜇g/g; higher amounts were detected by Prakash et al.(2007) who studied quercetin in four (red, white, violet, andgreen) onion varieties.Journal of Food Quality 5Table1:Volatilecompounds(mg/kgdw;mean±SD)detectedinBiancadiPompeionionlandraces.NumberRTVolatilecompoundmg/kgdwFebbrareseMarzaticaAprilaticaMaggiaiolaGiugneseAldehydes16.7Propionaldehyde5.30±0.10a12.65±0.26b72.39±1.51c48.37±1.01d132.51±2.77e223.42-Methyl-2-pentenaln.d.3.79±0.08a49.65±1.04b65.43±1.37c38.82±0.81d344.1Furfuraldehyde39.38±1.36a82.25±2.84b166.21±5.73c97.26±3.35b135.11±4.66d449.95-Methyl-2-furfuraldehyde35.68±0.87a13.48±0.33b68.76±1.67c105.06±2.56d88.84±2.16eTotal80.36±1.67a112.16±2.33b357.02±7.42c316.16±6.58d395.28±8.23eSulfur-containingcompounds57.31-Propanethioln.d.5.42±0.11a64.04±1.34b127.95±2.67c94.69±1.98d69.7Propylenesulfide26.01±0.84a27.83±1.49a59.83±1.94c29.02±0.94a52.08±1.69d717.1Dimethylsulfiden.d.22.35±0.47a18.00±0.38b53.87±1.13c16.88±0.35b825.8Methylpropyldisulfide10.04±0.27a25.51±0.69b5.21±0.14c84.34±2.28d11.59±0.31a929.3cis-Methyl-1-propenyldisulfide3.67±0.15a4.01±0.17a23.95±0.99b99.70±4.11c54.23±2.23d1029.55-Methyl-1,3-thiazolen.d.n.d.21.76±0.45a20.02±0.42a17.75±0.37a1131.9trans-Methyl-1-propenyldisulfide34.98±0.72ac30.96±0.67a232.11±3.47b138.67±0.87c181.23±2.76d1232.93,4-Dimethylthiophenen.d.n.d.184.18±3.85a40.46±2.90b127.86±3.79c1334.3Methyl-2-propenyldisulfide4.16±0.17a7.97±0.33a7.62±0.32a16.44±0.69b102.86±4.31c1437.5Dipropyldisulfide33.42±0.78a22.92±0.51b40.23±0.90c40.46±0.90c65.46±1.46d1539.81,2,4-Trithiolane3.51±0.09a4.87±0.13a160.66±6.12b116.808±3.1c54.74±1.44d1641.3trans-Propenylpropyldisulfide16.63±0.67a30.31±1.23b94.20±3.82c79.91±3.24d58.25±2.36e1742.9cis-Propenylpropyldisulfiden.d.n.d.112.60±2.35a21.32±0.45b33.42±0.70b1845.6Methylpropyltrisulfide38.86±1.01a46.03±0.77a276.67±7.67b379.52±10.52c226.48±6.28d1955.9Dipropyltrisulfide36.58±0.89a37.54±0.86a158.34±3.63b37.01±0.85a96.68±2.22cTotal207.87±4.61a265.72±5.89a1459.40±32.42b1285.48±28.53c1194.19±26.51cKetones2051.11,2-Cyclopentanedione12.15±0.34a12.90±0.37a59.43±1.69b72.06±2.05c69.21±1.97c2153.7Butyrolactonen.d.n.d.47.56±0.99a59.98±1.25a64.25±1.34aTotal12.15±0.34a12.90±0.37a106.99±4.09b132.04±5.04c133.46±5.10cOther 2254.5Furfurylalcohol34.90±0.73a18.34±0.38b43.97±0.92c64.81±1.35d156.85±3.28eTotalvolatilecompounds335.20±9.77a409.08±11.90a1967.39±43.70b1798.45±39.93c1874.48±41.75acDifferentletters(a,b,c,etc.)correspondtosignificantdifferences(𝑝≤0.05)amongonionlandraces.6 Journal of Food QualityTable 2: Phenols (mg/g dw; mean ± SD), antioxidant activity (EC50mg extract/mL; mean ± SD), and total phenols (mg GAE/g dw) of Biancadi Pompei onion landraces.Febbrarese Marzatica Aprilatica Maggiaiola GiugnesePhenols (mg/g dw)Gallic acid 55.66 ± 2.30a 59.56 ± 1.10ab 61.23 ± 2.50b 61.94 ± 1.91b 64.90 ± 1.22bFerulic acid 1.52 ± 0.20a 1.62 ± 0.25a 1.67 ± 0.41a 1.69 ± 0.19a 1.77 ± 0.30aQuercetin 6.98 ± 0.42a 7.47 ± 0.30b 7.68 ± 0.28b 7.77 ± 0.30b 8.14 ± 0.20bKaempferol 1.62 ± 0.33a 1.73 ± 0.27a 1.78 ± 0.15a 1.80 ± 0.21a 1.89 ± 0.32aChlorogenic acid 0.84 ± 0.06a 0.90 ± 0.02a 0.92 ± 0.08a 0.93 ± 0.04a 0.98 ± 0.07aAntioxidant activityEC50 (mg extract/mL) 18.80 ± 1.0a 18.50 ± 0.50a 20.90 ± 0.60b 20.25 ± 0.40b 21.27 ± 0.8bTotal phenols (mgGAE/g dw) 4.75 ± 0.24a 4.90 ± 0.10a 5.14 ± 0.35a 5.06 ± 0.28a 5.31 ± 0.30aDifferent letters (a, b) correspond to significant differences (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) among onion landraces.(mAU)5040302010(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(min)302520151050(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)Gallic acidChlorogenic acidFerulic acidQuercetinKaempferolFigure 1: Chromatograms of phenols in onion samples at 280 and350 nm (red and blue lines, resp.).All the other phenols increased in landraces harvestedin spring months. Our results highlighted the notion thatthe quantity of phenolic pool may change not only with thecultivar as reported in the literature [6, 34] but also with thegrowth stage and environmental conditions.The antioxidant activity varied from 19.00 to 21.27mgof extract/mL (Table 2). Our results were in agreement withprevious EC50 data on white onions [6] and consistent withquali-quantitative phenols previously described. In fact, thehighest values were found for Aprilatica, Maggiaiola, andGiugnese without significant differences (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) amongthem.It is generally accepted that there is a high correlationbetween levels of enzymatically produced pyruvate (EPY)present in onions and the perception of pungency [12]. Theinvestigation of this parameter was important to estimatethe potential flavour and to define the aroma characteristicsof various onion cvs. Classification of onions according topungency was proposed as follows: low, 0–3𝜇mol of pyruvicacid/g; moderate, 3–7 𝜇mol of pyruvic acid/g; and high,higher than 7 𝜇mol of pyruvic acid/g [37].Herein, all onion landraces had high pungency valuesexpressed by EPY amount, ranging from 9 to 14 𝜇mol/g FW.Significant differences (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) were found among the fivelandraces with the highest pungency level in Aprilaticalandrace.In order to define the sensory profile of onion, the sugarscontent was investigated. Three soluble sugars, sucrose, glu-cose, and fructose, were detected in the five onion landraces(Table 3). Other water soluble sugars (oligosaccharides offructose, named fructans) were found by Davis et al. (2007)in the characterization of different onion cvs cultivated in theUnited Kingdom.The total content of soluble sugars in Bianca di Pompeilandraces changed from 3 to 5 g/100 g FW according to theranges reported in the literature for other onion cultivars [38–42]. No statistical difference (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) was found among theonion landraces as regards fructose, while significant differ-ences (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) were found for glucose, sucrose, and the totalsugar content. Anyway, these differences do not influencethe sweetness of the onion because the pungency values arehigher than 4 𝜇mol/g FW, a medium-low level that wouldallow appreciating these differences during taste, as reportedby Crowther et al. [43].Seven organic acids were identified and quantified inonion samples (Table 3). The results were in accordance withthose found in Recas cv onions [40], in four onion Greek cvs[39], and in six onion Spanish cvs [41] with fumaric andglutamic acids too. The main acids that contribute mostly toedible flesh acidity are malic (78.94–57.61mg/100 g fw) andcitric (63.32–19.70mg/100 g fw) acids. Similar results werereported by Caruso et al. [44].Malic acid was the most abundant organic acid forall onion samples except for Febbrarese landrace, wherecitric acid was the abundant organic acid. Significant dif-ferences (𝑝 ≤ 0.05) were found among all landraces fororganic acids amount, probably due to a different activationlevel of multiple metabolic pathways, among which theCycle of Krebs is the main one. Regarding ascorbic acid, itcontributes to the nutritional value of the onion with respectto the other acids; the highest amount was found inAprilaticalandraces, followed by Maggiaiola and Giugnese, suggestingthat the samples harvested in spring months had highervit.

ConclusionsIn our study, we highlighted the differences, of the mostimportant quality parameters, existing among five onionlandraces belonging to “Bianca di Pompei” cv. In regard tothe investigation of onion volatile compounds, the volatilefraction was clearly dominated by sulfur compounds. Thesecompounds seemed to be influenced by harvest month andso from by temperature of growth; in fact, the landracesAprilatica,Maggiaiola, andGiugnese grownduring themildertime period showed higher amount of sulfur compoundsthan those registered in Febbrarese and Marzatica cultivatedand harvested in winter months. Similarly, total phenols,phenols profile, and antioxidant activity increased in onionlandraces harvested in spring months. The pungency ofall landraces was found to be high according to pungencyclassification of the onion. Also, for this parameter, thehighest values were found for onion samples grown duringmild months. Thus, even if the genetic factors as reported inthe literature are predominant for the expression of qualityand sensory parameters, this study highlights the notionthat also the external factors, such as the period of growth,influence some of the sensory attributes such as aroma andtaste.Competing InterestsThe authors declare that there are no competing interestsregarding the publication of this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis research was financially supported by “Ministero dell’Is-truzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca” and Regione Cam-pania as part of project “AGRIGENET—Network per la Sal-vaguardia e la Gestione delle Risorse Genetiche Agro-Alimentari Campane” (PSR 2007–2013, Misura 214).References[1] B.
