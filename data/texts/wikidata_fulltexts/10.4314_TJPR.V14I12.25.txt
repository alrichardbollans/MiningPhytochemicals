Abstract 
Melodinus is an important genus comprising of approximately 53 species of medicinal plants 
(Apocynaceae). Some species have been used in Chinese folk medicine for the treatment of meningitis 
in children, rheumatic heart diseases, and diuresis, as well as a decongestive against migraine and 
sinusitis. This paper is a review of the literature up to May 2015 and describes 263 compounds from 69 
articles, and includes chemical constituents isolated from Melodinus, mainly indole alkaloids, quinoline 
alkaloids, dimeric alkaloids, terpenoids and other compounds. It is also hoped that an overview of their 
cytotoxic characteristics will further the development of new anti-cancer agents.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Melodinus is a genus of ca. 53 species in the 
family Apocynaceae, mainly distributed in tropical 
and subtropical Asia and from Oceania to the 
Pacific coast. Among them, ca. 11 species occur 
in South China, Southwest China and Taiwan [1]. 
Some species, such as M. suaveolens and M. 
henyri have been used in Chinese folk medicine 
for the treatment of meningitis in children, 
rheumatic heart diseases, diuresis, bone fracture 
and so on [2,3]. M. scandens is used as a 
decongestive, against migraines, sinusitis and 
otitis [4]. In Australia, an aq extract of M. 
australis, when injected into a dog, produced a 
sharp drop in blood pressure, accompanied by 
an increase in the depth of respiration and 
decrease in rate [5]. Current crude alkaloid 
mixtures and purified alkaloids from some 
Melodinus species have demonstrated antitumor 
and antibacterial activities [6,7]. Many 
characteristic melodinus alkaloids, such as 
meloscine, epimeloscine, scandine and 
vincadifformine, had for a long time attracted 
great interest of synthetic organic chemists as 
challenging targets due to their marked diversity 
and complicated architectures [8,9,10] And more 
than twenty alkaloids were reviewed from the 
genus Melodinus by Sevenet et al [11]. About 14 
alkaloids can be classified into the melodan 
skeleton and its rearranged version and derived 
from 18, 19-didehydrotabersonine as parent 
compound in the plant family Apocynaceae [12] 
Recently, much attention has been paid to 
Melodinus plants to search active melodinus 
alkaloids. Extensive studies of the Melodinus 
genus have led to the identification of several 
novel alkaloids. Only 22 species of the genus 
have been chemically investigated and provided 
an array of structurally interesting indole

alkaloids, quinoline alkaloids, dimeric indole 
alkaloids, diterpenoids, triterpenes and others 
compounds over the past few decades. Some 
compounds show cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory 
activities. In this paper, we summarize 
phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of 
the Melodinus species so as to collate the 
existent information on this plant.  
 
PHYTOCHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS  
 
By the deadline of MAY 2015, phytochemical 
studies on this genus led to the isolation of 263 
compounds. Their structures are shown below 
and their names, the corresponding plant 
sources are collected. As can be seen, indole 
alkaloids are the dominant constituents within 
this genus. 
 
Alkaloids 
 
Plants of the genus Melodinus (Apocynaceae) 
have been proven to be good sources of 
alkaloids. This genus has been regarded as a 
rich source of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, 
which originated from the condensation of 
tryptophan with secologanin. We now list 252 
alkaloids which were obtained from the genus 
Melodinus. The structural characters and 
relationships of the major Melodinus alkaloid 
groups are discussed.  
Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids  
 
Kopsinine-type 
 
In this paper, indole alkaloids could be classified 
into ten groups from some Melodinus plants. This 
first type included nineteen alkaloids (1-19) 
(Table 1, Figure 1) [13-35]. The common 
characteristic compounds, venalstonine (3) and 
venalstonine (7) were produced by more than 
fifteen Melodinus species. Three aspidofractinine 
oxo-derivatives (9-11) were obtained from M. 
reticulates and M. guillauminii [13,14]. Melodinine 
L (12) was new alkaloid identified as 
venalstonine-N (4)-oxide from M. tenuicaudatus 
and M. yunnanensis [27,34]. Methoxyl 
substitution at C (15), a rare phenomenon, were 
present in pyrifoline (13) and refractidine (14) 
obtained from M. australis [33]. Melodinine Q 
(17) was venalstonine derivative with a 
CH3−CO−CH−unit [29]. 14, 15-Seco-3-oxo-
kopsinal (16) originated a further oxidation of 
bond C (14)-C (15) of venalstonine was identified 
by comparison of their spectral and physical 
properties from M. guillauminii [14].  10, 22 - 
Dioxokopsane was a known alkaloids but was 
isolated obtained from this genus for the first time 
[35].

Tabersonine-group 
 
This stereochemical series was more commonly 
encountered in the tabersonine group, as 
indicated in structures 20-55 (Table 2, Figure 2), 
respectively. The simple tabersonine derivatives 
(20-47) were identified from sixteen Melodinus 
species. Compounds 30- 36, in which C (14)-C 
(15) were epoxidized, were also isolated from M. 
aeneus, M. fusiformis, M. hemsleyanus, M. 
henryi, M. morsei, M. oblongus, M. suaveolens 
and M. tenuicaudatus [15,25-29,37,38,42,43]. 
Continuation of study on the genus Melodinus 
had led to the isolation of six new monoterpenoid 
indole alkaloids, melodinines M- S (47-52, resp.), 
as well as seven known tabersonine derivatives 
(25, 26, 29, 31, 45, 53) from M. suaveolens by 
Liu et al. The structure difference of 11-
hydroxytabersonine and melodinine A (47), 
melodinine A was that the benzene ring A was 
oxidized to a dienone system. Alkaloids (51 - 53) 
were identified as an acetonyl derivative of 
tabersonine by the NMR from M. tenuicaudatus 
[29]. And melotenine A (55), an unprecedented 
skeleton with a 6/5/5/6/7 pentacyclic rearranged 
Jiang et al 
Trop J Pharm Res, December 2015; 14(12): 2328  
 
ring system, which have been derived from 
tabersonine, was also isolated [41]. 
 
Vindolinine-type 
 
This type was a small group with eleven 
alkaloids, 56-66 (Table 3, Fig 3), which contained 
a C (2)-C (19) bond in an aspidospermine ring 
from Melodinus spps. All of them expect 
compound 66 belong to the five pair of epimers 
and their names, the corresponding plant 
sources and the reference are collected in Table 
3. 
 
Aspidospermidine-type 
 
Aspidospermidine alkaloids, 67-73 (Fig 4), may 
be derived from vincadifformine by deformylation. 
Eburenine (1,2-dehydroaspidospermidine) (67) 
and (-)-aspidospermidine (68) were isolated from 
air-dried leaves, twigs and aerial parts of M. 
morsei (L & T), M. henryi and air-dried leaves of 
M. celastroides [28,44,48,49]. Previous 
pharmacological investigations on leaves of M. 
celastroides, epi-20, 21(+)-aspidospermidine 
(69), Nb-oxyepi-20, 21(+)-aspidospermidine (70), 
melocelinine (71) and meloceline (72) were

Figure 4: Structures of aspidospermidine-type alkaloids from Melodinus spps 
 
isolated [50]. 6,7-Didehydroisotuboxenine (73) 
was only aspidospermidine alkaloid isolated from 
leaves and twigs of M. yunnanensis [32]. 
 
Aspidospermidine-type 
 
Aspidospermidine alkaloids, 67-73 (Fig 4), may 
be derived from vincadifformine by deformylation. 
Eburenine (1,2-dehydroaspidospermidine) (67) 
and (-)-aspidospermidine (68) were isolated from 
air-dried leaves, twigs and aerial parts of M. 
morsei (L & T), M. henryi and air-dried leaves of 
M. celastroides [28,44,48,49]. Previous 
pharmacological investigations on leaves of M. 
celastroides, epi-20, 21(+)-aspidospermidine 
(69), Nb-oxyepi-20, 21(+)-aspidospermidine (70),

melocelinine (71) and meloceline (72) were 
isolated [50]. 6,7-Didehydroisotuboxenine (73) 
was only aspidospermidine alkaloid isolated from 
leaves and twigs of M. yunnanensis [32]. 
 
Quebrachamine derivatives 
 
The group is exemplified by quebrachamine (74) 
and its derivatives (75-85) (Fig 5), which lack the 
C(7)-C(21) bond of aspidospermidine from M. 
australis, M. axillaries, M. fusiformis, M. morsei 
and M. suaveolens [16,18,28,37,44,45]. In this 
group, (S)-quebrachamine (74) and (+)-17-
methoxy- quebrachamine (75), rhazidine (76), 
11-hydroxyrhazidine (77) and axillarisinine (78) 
were isolated from roots of M. australis [18,45]. 
The leaves and twigs of M. yunnanensis were 
collected in Honghe (PR China), provided four 
new quebrachamine derivatives, 14β,15β-20S-
quebrachamine (80), 3-oxo-voaphylline (81), 
2α,7α-dihydroxy-dihydrovoaphylline (82), 
16β,21β-epoxy-vincadine (83), and three known 
compounds (+)-voaphylline (79), voalenine (84) 
and voaphylline hydroxyindolenine (85) [32]. 
Suaveolenine (86) was that a structure with a 
lactam ring and an additional five-membered ring 
containing an oxygen atom had been found from 
the trunk of M. suaveolens [37].

M. tenuicaudatus, M. suaveolens (L & T) and M. 
yunnanensis (L & T) [26,32,35,43,45,46]. 
 
Geissoschizine-type and derivatives (Table 
5(a) and (b), Figure 9) 
 
Twenty-five constituents, 133- 157, were isolated 
from M. acutiflorus, M. australis, M. fusiformis, M. 
hemsleyanus, M. khasianus, M. oblongus and M. 
tenuicaudatus [15,20,27,28,32,43,50,54]. 
Picraline-type (133-139) and anhydrojmaline-
type alkaloids (140-141) are biogenetically 
considered to be derived from geissoschizine 
(144) with its derivative by ring closure between 
the C(7) and C(16) positions and between the 
C(5) and C(16). As a common intermediate, 
geissoschizine (144) would also provide the 
mavacurine-type alkaloids (149-150) and 
tetrahidroalstonin (151).

Leuconotis alkaloid 376 and its analogues (Figure 10) 
 
Melodinines A-C (158-160, resp.), together with 
leuconotis alkaloid 376 (161), possessed 22 
skeletal carbons arranged compactly in six rings, 
were isolated from M. henryi by RP-18 gel and 
Sephadex LH-20 [48].  
 
Axillarisine (162) was found from dry root powder 
of M. axillaris by Yan et al [45]. Three other novel 
alkaloids, melohenine A (163), an unusual C24 
monoterpenoid indole alkaloid with additional 
skeletal carbons arranged compactly in eight 
rings, and henrycinols A- B (164-165) with an a 
cinnamoyl group system were also isolated from 
roots of M. henryi [52,57]. The relative 
configuration of henrycinols A and B was 
determined by NOESY analysis.

Other indole alkaloids, 166-178 (Figure 11) 
 
Two known compounds, stemmadenine (166) 
and its N-oxide (167), were isolated from M. 
henryi [18,35,48]. N-acyl-indolinique (168) and a 
new diazaspiroindole alkaloid, melodinine E 
(169) were structural type seldom reported from 
M. morsei and M. henryi, resp. [28,48]. 6/7-Seco 
rearranged spiro-indolone alkaloids, meloyunines 
A (170) and B (171) were elucidated from leaves 
and twigs of M. yunnanensis. These structures 
were elucidated based on NMR, FTIR, UV, and 
MS spectroscopic data [53]. Mehri et al reported 
melonine (172) and Nb-oxy-melonine (173) from 
M. celastroides possibly artifacts due to the use 
of CH2CI2 or HCI as an extraction solvent [40,49]. 
In 1978, Baassou et al found (-)-ibogamine (174) 
from M. aeneus [38]. Two novel alkaloids 
arbophylline (175) and 15-β-methoxy- 14, 15-
dihydroandranginine (176) were isolated from 
leaves and twigs of M. yunnanensis [32]. 
Melodinoxanine (177), which derived from an 
oxygenated derivative of isocarapanaubine 
(178), was a unique oxindole alkaloid with an 
extra oxygen atom in the C-ring of a 
heteroyohimbine skeleton from the stems and 
leaves of M. henryi growing in Yunnan, China 
[34]. 
 
 
Monoterpenoid quinoline alkaloids 
 
Scandine derivatives, 179-183 (Figure 12) 
 
In 1969, Bernauer et al identified scandine (179), 
which was a naturally occurring biologically 
active product derived from plants, was important 
as a possible starting material for the syntheses 
of valuable pharmaceuticals, from M. scandens 
first time [58]. Then, this compound and 10-
hydroxyscandine (180) were isolated from the 
other seven plants of M. fusiformis, M. 
hemsleyanus, M. henryi, M. khasianus, M. 
oblongus, M. tenuicaudatus, M. scandens, M. 
suaveolens [2,15,17,19,25,27,28,29,30,43,46, 
55,59]. And the absolute configuration has 
aroused the great concern [60]. The crystal 
structure and absolute configuration of (+)-
scandine have been determined by X-ray 
diffraction [61,62]. Some fo scandine derivatives, 
10-methoxyscandine (181), scandine Nb-oxide 
(182), melodinine U (183) and T (184), 
melodinhenine C-D (185-186) obtained from M. 
tenuicaudatus, M. fusiformis, M. henryi, M. 
suaveolens [15,27,29,55,63]. The interesting 
chemical significance of the Melodinus plants 
prompted researchers to initiate a phytochemical 
study on the twigs and leaves of M. suaveolens, 
which led to the isolation of two new quinoline 
alkaloids, 14, 15-dihydroscandine (187) and 15β-

hydroxy- 14,15-dihydroscandine (188), along 
with a known alkaloids 14, 15-β-epoxyscandine 
(189) [46,55]. 
 
Meloscine derivatives, 190-195 (Figure 12) 
 
Meloscine (190) and its Nb-oxide (191) were 
isolated from M. hemsleyanus, M. oblongus, 
M.scandens, M. suaveolens [25,30,55,59]. Four 
epi-meloscine compounds, N-oxyepimeloscine 
(192), epimeloscine (193), 9-
hydroxyepimeloscine (194) and 9-methoxy 
epimeloscine (195), were isolated from M. 
scandens [19,58,60,61,64]. Meloscandonine 
(196) was isolated from M. fusiformis, M. 
hemsleyanus, M. khasianus, M. scandens, M. 
oblongus, M. tenuicaudatus [15,19,25-
28,55,58,61]. And the structure of 
stereochemistry by UV, IR, NMR and X-ray 
[65,66]. 19-Epimeloscandonine (197) and 
melodinhenine E-F (198, 199) obtained from M. 
fusiformis, M. hemsleyanus, M. henryi and M. 
oblongus [25,28,63]. On the structure elucidation 
of the main alkaloids of M. acutiflorus, which led 
to a revision of the structures of rhazicine (200) 
and rhazimine (201), were first isolated. Further 
investigation of the extract of leaves of M. 
acutiflorus gave a new alkaloid, rhazicine N-
oxide (202) [56,67]. To our knowledge, the first 
report of the co-occurrence of monoterpenoid 
indoles meloyunine C (203) and precursor Δ14-
vincamenine (104) in same plant, supporting the 
biosynthesis of quinoline from M. yunnanensis 
and concurring with previous in vivo tracer 
experiments in the literature [53]. 
 
Other monomeric alkaloids, 204-210 (Figure 
13) 
 
(-)-Rhazinilam (204) was a natural compound 
isolated from M. australis and M. henryi, whose 
tetracyclic structure possesses an axially chiral 
phenyl-pyrrole subunit bridged by a nine-
membered lactam ring [18,35,48,68]. Melohenine 
B (205), 14, 15-dehydromelohenine B (206) and 
14-O-ethyl-substituted (3α,14α,16α)-2,7-
secoeburnamine derivative (207) with an 
unprecedented 6/9/6/6 tetracyclic ring system, 
regarded as a key intermediate from indole to 
quinoline alkaloids were obtained from M. henryi 
and M. yunnanensis [35,52,55]. Three simple 
alkaloids, venoterpine (208), ( )-R/S-1-(3-
pyridyl)ethanol (209) and 2, 5-diphenyloxazole 
(210), were also isolated from M. aeneus, M. 
axillaris and M. celastroides [33,38,45]. 
 
Bisindole alkaloids 
 
Eburnamine derivative dimeric alkaloids 
(Figure 14) 
 
Fifteen bisindole alkaloids, melonines C-D 
(211−212), having an eburnamine-aspido-
spermidine linkage, guillauminiine (213), 
paucivenine (214), tenuicausine (215), 
demethylteuicausine (216) and melodinine J 
(217), possessing an eburnamine-tabersonine 
skeleton, melodinine H-I (218-219),  
melodinhenine A-B (220-221) of the eburnamine-
vindolinine type, and melonine A (222), 
melaxillarinine (223) and melaxillaridine (224) 
with an eburnamine-quebrachamine derivatives, 
were isolated from eight Melodinus species by 
column chromatography (CC),TLC, RP-18 gel, 
Sephadex LH-20 [6,14,21,27,42,43,45,65,68-
71].The absolute configuration of 220 and 221 
was determined using ECD exciton chirality 
method. M. insulaepinorum furnished an 
eburnamine-kopsinine bisalkaloid, insulopinine 
(225) [24]. From M. celastroides, celastromeline 
(226) and celastromelidine (227) were the tertiary 
analogues of Le chlorure de chloromethyl 
celastromelinium (228) and Le chlorure de 
chloromethyl celastromelidinium (229), and their 
quasi-dimeric structures were not likely to be 
artifacts [49]. The laster eburnamine-
diazaspiroindole bisindole alkaloids, melonine B 
(230) was isolated as a pale-red powder from M. 
henryi [71].

Figure 14: Structures of eburnamine-type dimeric alkaloids from Melodinus spps 
 
Tabersonine derivative dimeric alkaloids, 231- 
247 (Figure 15) 
 
In this part, we list all tabersonine derivative 
dimeric alkaloids except eburnamine-tabersonine 
type. Tabersonine-tabersonine skeleton, 
melodinine K (231) and melomorsine I (232) 
were isolated from M. tenuicaudatus and M. 
fusiformis, resp. [27,28]. In 2013, melosuavine D-
F (233-235) were identified by Liu et al from 
twigs and leaves of M. suaveolens [69]. From M. 
suaveolens and M. scandens, three tabersonine-
scandine, melosuavine A-C (236-238), and three 
tabersonine-vindolinine type, melosuavine G-H 
(239-240) and scandomelidine (241) were 
obtained [69,72]. The isolation and structural 
determination of lochnericine-kopsinine 
derivatives from M. yunnanensis and M. morsei, 
meloyine (242) and melornorsine (243), were 
studied [32,44]. Four 18, 19-dehydrotabersonin-
vincadifformine derivatives, scandomelonine 
(244) and its epimer (245), scandomeline (246) 
and its epimer (247), were isolated from M. 
scandens [72,73]. 
 
Other dimeric alkaloids (248-252), (Figure 15) 
 
Melaxilline (248) and melaxillinine (249) were 
obtained from M. axillaris [45]. To investigate 
antitumor indole alkaloids from the leaves and 
twigs of M. morsei, melofusine I (250) was 
subjected to RP-18 silica gel CC on eluting with 
70 % - 75 % aq. MeOH [28]. M. celastroides 
contained two other dimeric alkaloids, Dichlorure 
de methylene Nb,Nb' [bis-[(+)-meloninium] (251) 
and   methylene 10,10'-bis-[(+)-Na-norvallesami-

Figure 17: Structures of terpenoids and other compounds from Melodinus spps 
 
dine (252). And alkaloid 251 was a quaternary 
ammonium and 252 possibly artifacts due to the 
use of CH2Cl2 as an extraction solvent [49]. 
 
Diterpenoids, triterpenes and others 
compounds (Figure 17) 
 
A novel labdane diterpene, medigenin (253), O-
acetyl-medigenin (254) and its glycoside, 
medinin (255), have been isolated from the ether 
extract of M. monogynus [74,75]. Four 
triterpenes, β-amyrin acetate (256), uvaol (257), 
monogynols A (258) and B (259), were isolated 
from M. henryi, M. monogynus and M. reticulatus 
[2,13,76-78]. One iridoid glycosides named 
loganin (260), a lignan glycoside, isolariciresinol-
monoglucoside (261), two steroids, digitoxigenin 
(262) and β-sitosterol (263), were isolated from 
M. henryi, M. monogynus and M. morsei 
[2,36,78]. 
 
Extraction and isolation 
 
Four methods were used for extraction and 
isolation. Firstly, the air-dried sample was 
extracted with EtOH or MeOH. The extract was 
partitioned between organic solvent and HCl 
solution. The acidic water-soluble materials, 
adjusted to pH 9 - 10 with ammonia solution, 
were extracted with EtOAc, MeOH or CHCl3 to 
give an alkaloidal extract. Then, the extract was 
subjected to silica gel column chromatography 
(CC), TLC, MPLC with RP-18 gel CC, Sephadex 
LH-20 CC [27-29,32,34]. Secondly, M. fusiformis 
were extracted exhaustively with EtOH. After 
concentration, the material was obtained which 
was then dissolved in citric acid or tartaric acid, 
filtered and the solution adjusted to pH 5 and 7 
with NH4OH, and then extracted with CHCL3, 
repeatedly. The extract was subjected to silica 
gel column chromatography (CC). Lastly, some 
dried Melodinus spps were ground and extracted 
with acetone or EtOH. The extract was filtered 
and concentrated and the residue extracted with 
similarity principle. The extract was subjected to 
silica gel column chromatography (CC), Et2O, 
CHCL3 and MeOH being used as eluents. 
 
Pharmacological aspects 
 
Cytotoxic activity 
 
Continuous investigation of bioactive indole 
alkaloids from the genus Melodinus, include tests 
against seven human tumor cell lines, HL-60, 
SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480, SK-BR-3 
and PANC-1.The results showed that these 
compounds exhibited stronger inhibitory activity 
with low IC50 than that of cisplatin (Table 6). 
 
Pharmacological screening revealed 11-
hydroxytabersonine (24) displayed antitumor 
activity [17]. 
 
Compound 32, 11-hydroxy-14,15α- 
epoxytabersonine, and rhazinilam (204) were the 
source of potent antitumor compounds against P-
338 cell and KB cell line [15,79,80]. Evaluated for 
cytotoxicity by using the WT cell, compound 207 
exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity [35]. 
Demethylteuicausine (216), a new bisindole 
alkaloid was isolated from M. hemsleyanus, 
showed antitumor activities in pharmacological 
tests KB cell and HCT [6].

Anti-inflammatory effects 
 
Two new compounds 187-188 exhibited 
significant, dose-dependent inhibition of the 
production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
NO, IL-6 and IL-8 in mice macrophages. The 
results suggested that these new quinoline 
alkaloids could be new potential candidates for 
development as anti-inflammatory agents [46]. 
 
Other activities 
 
11,19R-dihydroxytabersonine (30) had significant 
anti-fertility activity. The results of spermicidal 
effect in vitro showed that spermicidal 
concentration of 0.2 mg/ml [15]. Rhazinilam (204) 
evaluated against the disassembly of 
microtubules into tubulin with IC50 value of 2 - 3 
μM [79,80]. Metabolism studies were conducted 
in order to investigate the reasons for the in vivo 
lack of activity of (-)-rhazinilam. The oxidative 
metabolism of (-)-rhazinilam were markedly less 
active than it in vitro, which might explain its in 
vivo inactivity [80]. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Plants of the family Apocynaceae have been 
proven to be good sources of indole alkaloids, 
quinoline alkaloids, which originated from the 
condensation of tryptophan with secologanin. 
Some have been reported to display in vitro 
cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell 
lines, anti-inflammatory effects and antifertility 
activity. However, there still arise questions 
concerning the structure-activity relationships 
and elucidation of the action mechanism. There 
are 23 species of this genus whose isolation and 
activities have not previously been reported. 
Thus, much attention should be paid to the other 
Melodinus species via further phytochemical, 
pharmacological and structure-activity 
relationship studies.
