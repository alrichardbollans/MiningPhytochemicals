ABSTRACT
Folk medicines are gaining great importance as informa-
tion sources on traditional medicinal plants. The aim of
this paper is the study of a plant traditionally employed by
the Puna inhabitants: Werneria poposa Phil. Morphology
of its secretory tissue and other histological diagnostic
features, as well as the chemical composition of its essen-
tial oil, is described. Puna inhabitants use W. poposa
mainly as an infusion for mountain sickness (“soroche”),
stomach and hepatic disorders and cold. It is also used
externally as a hot bath or unguent for rheumatic pains or
traumas. Secretory tissues are schizogenous ducts in
leaves and stems. Thirty-one components were detected in
the essential oil by means of GC/MS analysis. Oil was
characterized by the presence of high content of b-pinene
(21.7%), a-pinene (5.5%), terpinen-4-ol (5.3%), a-ter-
pinene (5.2%), b-phellandrene 1 1,8-cineole (4.8%),
isopulegol (4.8%) and b-citronellal (4.6%). At the present
time, W. poposa is consumed as a medicinal plant, mainly
in the northwest of Argentina, not being commercialized in
the urban centers.
INTRODUCTION
Essential oils are responsible for the characteristic
scent, odor and flavour of many plants, and are eco-
nomically important as the basis of natural perfumes,
spices and by their extensive use as medicinal plants.
The vast majority of these drugs are used in crude form,
mainly for the preparation of infusions (Bruneton,
1995). Many aromatic plants are used by the inhabi-
tants of Puna as therapeutical resources; they can rec-
ognize them by odor and some morphological features.
Folk medicines are gaining importance as a source
of information for traditional medicinal plants
(Hostettmann et al., 1995). These drugs are subjected to
investigation in the search for new biodynamic com-
pounds with renewed rigor. A common belief is that
plant remedies are naturally superior to synthetic drugs
and that they are not harmful to human beings (Beier,
1992).
The goal of this paper is to establish traditional and
current uses of W. poposa by the Puna inhabitants, the
morphology of secretory tissue and other histological
diagnostic features, as well as the chemical composi-
tion of its essential oil.
Werneria poposa Phil. (common names: poposa,
pupusa [Compositae]) has the following characteris-
tics: fetid, very branchy, cushion forming, sub-shrub,
(cojín), 3–5 cm height, stems densely leafy; wide inner
woolly leaf sheath. Apical solitary sessile and radial
capitulum, campaniform involucral with glabrous
oblong phyllary. Dimorphic tubulose hermaphroditic
flowers; white ligulate radial flowers and yellow-lili-
aceus disc flowers. Cylindricous glabrous ribbed ach-
ene, white-yellow papus (Fig. 1). It grows in high
mountains of South America: South Perú, North Chile
and North West Argentina (from Jujuy to Tucuman).
4600–5300 m above sea level. This region is known as
Puna (Cabrera, 1978) (Fig. 2).

was also purchased at local markets. The plant was
botanically confirmed using available literature (Cabr-
era, 1978).
A voucher specimen was deposited at the Museo de
La Plata herbarium and at the Laboratorio de Etnob-
otanica y Botánica Aplicada (LEBA) herbarium No. 9,
L. Abella.
The area was surveyed four times between 1995 and
1997, in different seasons, to perform ethnobotanical
studies. Data were obtained from native informants
who were healers, faith healers, ordinary villagers and
market traders. The information was collected by
means of direct observation, participating observation
interviews and tape recordings.
Samples were hydrated in water during 24 h for his-
tological studies, performed with a light microscope
(LM). Sections were performed with frozen microtome
Microm HM 340 E and also with a manual one. Oxi-
dant agents H2O2 (100 vol) and NaClO were used to
clear the sections. In order to detect terpenoids histo-
chemically, the SbCl3/HClO4 reagent, that generates a
red colour, was used (Mace et al., 1976).
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used.
Fragments of the leaves and stems were Critical Point
dried. The samples were previously fixed with FAA
(formaline 1 anhydrous acetic acid 1 anhydrous
ethanol) for four days, and then successively washed in
ethanol, 50, 70 and 100%.
The secretion tissue was described; in addition,
other histological characters were studied which could
be useful as diagnostic features to identify fragmented,
powdered or destroyed samples.
Air-dried plant material was hydrodistilled in an all
glass Clevenger-type apparatus to isolate volatile con-
stituents. The oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sul-
phate and stored at 4°C in the dark.
Analytical GC was performed on a Varian 3300 gas
chromatograph equipped with a silicone DB-1 capillary
column (30 m 3 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm)
using nitrogen at a 1.5 ml/min flow rate as carrier gas.
Injections were made by the split mode, and column
temperature programmed from 80 to 225°C at 4°C/min.
Injector temperature was 250°C, and a FID detector at
300°C was used. Injection volume was 0.1 ml for all
samples. GC/MS analysis was carried out on a Hewlett
Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a sili-
cone SE-30 capillary column (20 m 3 0.2 mm) at a car-
rier gas flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Temperature was
programmed from 70 to 210°C at 4°C/min and the
injector temperature was 250°C. The chromatograph
was coupled to a HP 5971 A mass selective detector
(70 eV). All constituents were identified by comparing
their Kováts retention indices with those of authentic
standards available in the author’s laboratory. The lat-
ter were compared with those stored in the spectrome-
ter database using the commercial NBS54K.L and
WILEY.L built-in libraries and with those reported in
the literature (Libey, 1991; Adams, 1995).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
W. poposa is widely used as a therapeutic resource in
Puna. The most common method of preparation is as
infusion: less than a handful of leaves and stems in a

cup of tea (250 ml of boiling water) are used for
“soroche” (mountain sickness). It is also used as a
digestive and for hepatic colics, cough, cold and bron-
chitis, and as a food condiment for pneumonia conva-
lescents. Former reports dealing with some of these
uses in the North West of Argentina (Palma, 1973;
Perez De Nucci, 1988; Martinez & Pochettino, 1992)
were confirmed in the present study.
External use is also very common, as a hot bath,
mainly for the feet, or associated with Artemisia copa
(“copa-copa”) for rheumatic pains (Palma, 1973).
Bibliographic references mention its use in the
preparation of unguents (powdered plant mixed with
hen fat) to treat rheumatic and traumatic pains, and also
as a local antiinflamatory (Meyer, 1943; Zardini, 1984).
The use of the root in pleurisy has been reported in one
case (Debelmas, 1975).
At the present time, W. poposa is consumed as a
medicinal plant, mainly in the northwest of Argentina,
not being commercialized in urban centers.
Secretory tissues are schizogenous ducts which go
through leaves and stems (Figs. 3, 4, 5); their diameter

is uniform (350–400 mm) and they are internally coated
with thin-walled epithelial secretory cells (Fig. 6). Pos-
itive terpenoid histochemical reactions were detected in
all the tests performed on these tissues or in secretion
products.
Volatile oils are pressurized within the ducts, and a
slight traumatism produced in the plant immediately
releases the essential oil. Poposa is a very aromatic
smelling plant.
In addition to the secretory tissues, the main histo-
logical diagnostic features are the abundant whip-like
trichomes present in the leaf sheath, with two basal
cells and a very long apical (1–1.5 mm), twisted, thick
wall cell (Fig. 7). The leaf sheath is very woolly; these
leaf sheath hairs are characteristic of other Compositae
whose apical cells are not as long and thick as in W.
poposa (Metcalfe & Chalk, 1979).
Other features are the deep stomata and a thick waxy
layer of the aerial parts, characteristic of xerophytic
plants (Fig. 8) (Ancibor, 1980).
The components of the oil, the percentage by weight
of each constituent and their Kováts indices are

summarized in Table 1. The components are arranged
in the order of GC elution from the silicone columns.
The yield of essential oil was about 1% based on dried
weight.
The oil was characterized by the presence of a high
content of b-pinene (21.8%); other important compo-
nents were found to be a-pinene (5.5%), terpinen-4-ol
(5.3%), a-terpinene (5.2%), b-phellandrene 1 1.8- cine-
ole (4.8%), isopulegol (4.8%) and b-citronellal (4.6%).
The a- and b-pinenes produce an increase of blood
flow in the skin and in the mucous membranes; this
explains its external use for rheumatic pains and as
infusion for digestive problems. This monoterpene is
also a well know antiseptic (Duke, 1991). Terpenes are
found in the leaves of some desert plants and are the
cause of allelopathic effects (Harbone, 1977).
There are no records about intoxications caused by
the use of poposa, though it is widely consumed by
people. Evidently the Puna inhabitants know about the
dose to be used for various health problems.
