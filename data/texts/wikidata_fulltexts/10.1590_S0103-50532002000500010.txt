O fracionamento do extrato acetato de etila de frutos de Punica granatum, guiado por ensaios
antimicrobianos frente a colônias de Staphylococcus aureus resistentes à meticilina, conduziu ao
isolamento e à determinação estrutural do tanino elágico punicalagina. A identificação da substância
foi realizada por CLAE/UV e RMN de 1H. Os ensaios antimicrobianos foram realizados pelo
método de difusão em discos de papel. A concentração mínima inibitória das substâncias foi determinada
pelo método de diluição em agar padronizada pelo NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards).
The ethyl acetate extract of Punica granatum fruits was fractionated by chromatographic
techniques to afford the ellagitannin punicalagin. The substance was found to be active against
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was identified by HPLC/UV and 1HNMR.
The antibacterial assays which guided the isolation of the tannin were conducted using the disc
diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the dilution method
according to NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) procedure.
Keywords: Punica granatum, punicalagin, antimicrobial activity
Introduction
As part of our effort to identify the substances responsible
for the pharmacological activities attributed to plants utilized
in Brazil in popular medicine we have studied the epicarp of
pomegranate fruits to identify the components with
antimicrobial activity. Punica granatum Linn. (Punicaceae) is
a shrub or small tree native to Asia1 where its several parts have
been used as an astringent, haemostatic, as a remedy for
diabetes, as an anthelmintic specifically against tapeworms
and for diarrhoea and dysentery.2 In Brazil the fruits are known
as “romã” and are used for the treatment of throat infections,
coughs and fever. There are several commercial
phytopreparations in Brazil containing extracts from
pomegranate. For the validation of such products it is necessary
to define chemical markers, substances that when present in
the preparations attest their quality.3 Although many reports
on the antimicrobial activity of pomegranate exist in the
literature, none of them relates such activity with its chemical
composition. We describe here for the first time the isolation
and identification of the tannin responsible for the activity
against a bacterium of medical importance (Staphylococcus
aureus). Interest in plants with antimicrobial properties have
been revived due to current problems associated with the use
of antibiotics. With the increasing prevalence of methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains as pathogens
in both hospital and the community, the investigation of plant
extracts active against this organism provides an example of
prospecting for new compounds which may be effective against
infections currently difficult to treat.4
Experimental
General experiments procedures
All reagents were of analytical grade. The NMR
spectrum of the compound was taken on a Varian-Gemini
607Antimicrobial Ellagitannin of Punica granatum FruitsVol. 13, No. 5, 2002
200 (1H: 200 MHZ spectrometer). Column chromatography
was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) and
XAD-16 resin (Sigma). Thin layer chromatography was
performed on cellulose plates (Merck), HPLC/UV on a
Shimadzu instrument equipped with a diode array detector
and RP-18 column (5 µm, 20 X 5 mm, Merck) and
preparative HPLC on a Shimadzu instrument equipped
with UV detector and RP-18 column (10 µm, 25 X 2 cm).
Antibacterial assays were performed on Mueller Hinton
agar medium (Oxoid).
Extraction and isolation of the constituents
Fresh fruit pericarp (240 g) was exhaustively extracted
with EtOH. The dried ethanolic extract was suspended in
water and successively partitioned with hexane,
chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol. The most active
fraction on bioassay (ethyl acetate) was chromatographed
on a XAD-16 column using a water – methanol gradient.
The active fraction eluted from the column with
H
2
O:MeOH (1:1) was submitted to chromatography on a
Sephadex LH-20 column using a gradient H
2
O:MeOH and
the active fraction was purified on a preparative HPLC
column to afford the active compound punicalagin and
the inactive ones, ellagic acid and punicalin.
Bacterial strains
Brazilian prevalent clone methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus strains (6 isolates – Table 1) were
obtained from hospitalized patients in two Brazilian
hospitals (Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho
– RJ and Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal de
Uberlândia – MG) and identified at the Institute of
Microbiology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.5
Furthermore, as a comparison parameter, 10 MRSA strains
from other clones were tested, as well as 8 MSSA
(methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) and 2 reference strains [S.
aureus ATCC 29213 (MSSA) and ATCC 33591 (MRSA)].
Assay for antibacterial testing
Disc diffusion method6
Petriplates containing 20 mL of Mueller Hinton agar
medium were seeded with a 24 h old culture of the
bacterial strains. The extracts, fractions and pure
compounds were tested in concentration of 25 or 50 mg
mL-1, applying 10 µL of each sample to sterile filter paper
discs (5 mm in diameter) and placed on the surface of the
medium. The inoculum size was adjusted so as to deliver
a final inoculum of approximately 108 colony-forming
units (CFU)/mL.7 Incubation was made at 37 °C for 24 h.
The assessment of antibacterial activity was based on the
measurement of diameter of the inhibition zone formed
around the disc.
Dilution method
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
determined by dilution according to NCCLS.8 Mueller
Hinton agar is prepared and sterilized in the usual fashion

by autoclaving. Before solidification, 20 mL of agar
medium is added to each of the Petri dishes containing the
samples and the Petri dishes are swirled carefully until the
agar begins to set. Final concentration from 250 to
0,97 µg mL-1 were used for each plant sample. The bacterial
inoculum size was adjusted so as to deliver a final inoculum
of approximately 104 colony-forming units (CFU/mL8 and
was added to the medium using a Steers replicator.
Results and Discussion
The active fraction when analyzed by TLC on cellulose
plates (H
2
O:CH
3
COOH, 4:1) showed initially the presence
of two orange colored spots with NaNO
2
 reagent, turning
purple after some minutes. This is a characteristic reaction
for ellagitannins.9 However, these two substances show up
as four when analyzed by analytical HPLC/UV (Figure1A).
Each one of the four peaks was obtained by preparative
HPLC (H
2
O:CH
3
CN, 9:1) and after liophilization was
reanalyzed by analytical HPLC/UV. Figure 1C shows the
presence of two substances for each peak. This is in fact a
characteristic phenomenon of hydrolysable tannins with
an unsubstituted anomeric hydroxyl group.10 The substances
were identified as punicalin α 1 and punicalin β 2,
punicalagin α 3 and punicalagin β 4, the major ellagitannins
from the pomegranate.11 Figure 1B shows the UV spectra of
these substances (λ
max
 = 218, 260 and 379 nm). These
values are characteristic of a gallagyl cromophore12
conferring to the compounds a bright yellow colour. Acid
hydrolysis of punicalin afforded gallagyldilactone
(identified by HPLC/UV, RT 3.2 min) and glucose (identified
by co-chromatography on silica gel plates). Acid hydrolysis
of punicalagin afforded gallagyldilactone, ellagic acid
(HPLC/UV, 3.2 min and 4.9 min) and glucose.

The antibacterial activity for punicalagin (250 µg -
disc diffusion method – Figure 4) afforded a clear inhibition
zone of 20 mm for all bacteria tested. The minimum
inhibitory concentration was established as 61.5 µg mL-1
(Table 1). It is noteworthy that Burapadaja and Bunchoo,13
in a phytochemical study of Terminalia citrina, isolated
punicalagin and assayed it against several bacterial

colonies. For a methicillin-resistant S. aureus colony, they
found a MIC value of 768 µg mL-1.
Conclusion
Our results show that the ellagitannin punicalagin is
the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity of
the pomegranate. Furthermore, this compound presented
an activity 10 fold higher than the one found by Burapadaja
and Bunchoo.13 For the standardization of phytopharma-
ceuticals it could be the chemical marker of choice.
