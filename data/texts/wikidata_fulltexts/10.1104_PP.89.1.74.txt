ABSTRACT
Pulsed positive ion-negative ion chemical ionization mass
spectra of 0-glucosyl-zeatin and -dihydrozeatin, their ribosides,
and their N-9 2-cyanoethyl and 2-chloro-2-cyanoethyl derivafives
are reported. By methods based on these spectra, the levels of
the glucosides were determined in soybean (Glycine max) leaves.
The first mass spectrometric quantifications of the endog-
enous O-glucosides, OGZ', OGDZ, OGZR, and OGDZR,
were based on El mass spectrometry of TMS derivatives of
the intact glucosides, the samples being introduced into the
mass spectrometer via the direct inlet probe (8). Subsequently,
a number of workers have purified an O-glucoside fraction,
hydrolyzed this with fl-glucosidase, and quantified the released
bases and ribosides by GC-MS. The assumption has been
made that these are derived from the known glucosides OGZ,
OGDZ, OGZR, and OGDZR (3, 9). However, for reasons
already presented (6) this assumption is not valid. It is impor-
tant to quantify these glucosides per se, and not as aglycones
formed by enzymic cleavage. The procedures used to achieve
this with soybean leaf extracts are detailed herein.
The techniques employed are based on negative ion CI
mass spectrometry. To facilitate determination of OGZ and
OGDZ, a new selective derivatization procedure was devel-
oped which yields a stable chlorine-containing derivative of
these glucosides. The chlorine atom greatly facilitates detec-
tion of the glucosides by mass spectrometry. The derivative
has other advantages over per-TMS and permethyl derivatives
for direct inlet probe analysis. With cytokinin glucosides,
multiple product formation tends to accompany preparation
of per-TMS derivatives (1, 4). Per-TMS derivatives are also
very rapidly hydrolyzed by traces of water. While permethyl
derivatives of OGZ and OGDZ can be subjected to GC (5)
and are stable, the preparation of the necessary reagents and
the derivatization procedure are inconvenient and the con-
centration ofthe methylsulfinyl carbanion must be controlled
carefully (1, 4). Because derivatized cytokinin glucosides yield

complex El spectra with weak molecular ions, CI mass spec-
trometry has clear advantages for quantification of these
compounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mass Spectrometry
All spectra were determined with a Finnigan 4530 mass
spectrometer. PPINICI spectra were determined at 140 eV
(source temperature of 120C) by the desorption method. The
sample was applied to a rhenium wire mounted at the end of
the direct inlet probe which was inserted into the plasma of
the CI source. Unless stated otherwise, the wire was heated at
the rate of 20 mA s-'. The reagent gas was ammonia at 1 torr.
EI spectra were determined at 70 eV and a source temperature
of 150°C. Samples were applied to a rhenium wire at the
probe tip.
Preparation of Derivatives
N-9 CCE derivatives of OGZ, OGDZ, iP, and DZ were
prepared by heating the sample with anhydrous n-butanol (50
I,L), triethylamine (3 ,uL), and 2-chloroacrylonitrile (10 ,uL:
source: Fluka AG, Switzerland) for 30 min at 80°. To prepare
the N-9 CyE derivatives, the 2-chloroacrylonitrile was re-
placed with acrylonitrile. The reaction solutions were evapo-
rated under vacuum at 40°C, and the residues were chromat-
ographed on Merck HPTLC reverse phase plates (RP-2, 10 x
10 cm) using 40% (v/v) ethanol as solvent. Prior to use, the
plates were washed with 80% (v/v) ethanol, and after chro-
matography, the spots of derivatives were eluted by stirring
with this solvent (60 ,tL). An aliquot of the supematant
obtained by centrifugation was used for mass spectrometry.
The CCE derivative of OGDZ was hydrolyzed with f,-
glucosidase (6) and the aglycone was partitioned into n-
butanol and purified by HPTLC as above.
Purification of Glucoside Fraction for Mass Spectrometry
To the glucoside fraction prepared previously from soybean
(Glycine max) leaf blades (6), D5 OGZ, OGDZ, OGZR, and
OGDZR (5 ,ug of each) were added. These D5 glucosides
(labeled in the methyl and adjacent methylene group of the
isoprenoid sidechain) were prepared according to Summons
et al. (7). A solution of the glucoside fraction in acetic acid
(1%, v/v) was passed through a Baker 10 SPE C18 column
(0.5 g packing; J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) which was
washed with 1% acetic acid and then eluted with 25% (v/v)

subjected to TLC on cellulose (6; layer washed with 65% v/v
methanol) using n-butanol- 14 N ammonia-water (6:1:2, upper
phase) as solvent. Two UV-absorbing zones were clearly evi-
dent on the layer at RF 0.15 (OGZ plus OGZR) and RF 0.22
(OGDZ plus OGDZR). These were eluted with 65% (v/v)
methanol and rechromatographed on Merck HPTLC reverse
phase plates (RP-2) as described above for derivatives. Elution
with 80% (v/v) ethanol (50-70 gL) yielded the four 0-gluco-
sides for PPINICI mass spectra; RF values observed were:
OGZ, 0.71; OGDZ, 0.62; OGZR, 0.87; OGDZR, 0.82.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
PPINICI mass spectra were first determined for D5 OGZ,
OGDZ, OGZR, and OGDZR (Table I). The heating rate of
the probe tip greatly influenced the spectra of OGZR and
OGDZR. A rapid rate ofheating favored quasi-molecular and
molecular ions (MH+ and M-), while a slow rate of heating
enhanced the intensity of the fragment ions caused by deri-
bosylation (-R ions). This is illustrated by the negative spectra
OGDZR. Thus, when the rhenium wire at the tip ofthe probe
was heated at the rate of 5 and 20 mamp s-', the intensity of

ions predominated, while [M-H]- ions were dominant in the
negative ion spectra. The ratio of summed ion currents for
[M-H]-/MH' was 6 and 8 for OGZ and OGDZ, respectively.
In the positive ion spectra of OGZR and OGDZR, the base
peak was due to the -R ions (m/z 387 and 389, respectively),
while M- ions predominated in the negative ion spectra. As
in the cases of OGZ and OGDZ, the summed ion currents
due to the base peaks of the negative ion spectra greatly
exceeded those ofthe positive spectra. Thus, the current ratios
for m/z 518 (negative)/m/z 387 (positive) of OGZR, and m/
z 520 (negative)/m/z 389 (positive) ofOGDZR, were 35 and
21, respectively. Because ofthis great difference in sensitivity,
negative ion mass spectrometry has clear advantages over
positive ion spectrometry for detection and quantification of
cytokinin O-glucosides. This was further substantiated in
work with actual samples from soybean leaves.
Quantification oforganic compounds by mass spectrometry
using stable isotope labeled internal standards should be based
on at least two ion pairs. By selection of a suitable heating
rate, it is possible to fragment OGZR and OGDZR to obtain
prominent -R fragment ions as well as MH+ and M- ions.
Hence, suitable ion pairs can be readily obtained for quanti-
fication. In contrast, the O-glucoside bases, OGZ and OGDZ,
yield pronounced quasi-molecular ions with little fragmenta-
tion. Hence, for quantification of these compounds by CI
mass spectrometry, formation of stable derivatives suitable
for liquid chromatography is desirable. These glucosides could
then be quantified per se and again after derivatization and
chromatography of the remaining sample. Agreement be-
tween the two analyses would validate the results. A deriva-
tization procedure which would exhibit specificity for 0-
glucoside bases was developed and involved Michael-type
additions of acrylonitrile or 2-chloroacrylonitrile to the N-9
position of the purine ring to yield compounds with CyE
(Scheme I, I) or CCE (Scheme I, II) moieties. BAP has been
converted to a CyE derivative for use as a synthetic interme-
diate (2); however, the reaction method was not adaptable to
the ,ug level required in the present study. Under the condi-
tions now used, cyanoethylation of the glucose hydroxyl
groups did not occur. PPINICI spectra ofthese derivatives are
given in Table I.
All spectra ofthe derivatives showed intense molecular ions
or quasi-molecular ions with two exceptions. In the negative
ion spectra of the CyE derivatives of OGZ and OGDZ, M-
and [M-H]- ions were not detected, and intense fragment

QUANTIFICATION OF CYTOKININ O-GLUCOSIDES
ions formed by cleavage of the CyE group were the ions of
highest mass. The intensities of the positive and negative ion
spectra were compared. Ion current for the most intense ion
suitable for quantification in the negative spectrum was al-
ways greater than that in the positive spectrum, and this was
especially so with CCE derivatives. Ion current ratios were as
follows for Ds glucosides:
CyE OGZ 385 (-)/440 (+) = 15
CyE OGDZ 387 (-)/442 (+) = 7.1
CCE OGZ 473 (-)/474 (+)> 300
CCE OGDZ 475 (-)/442 (+)> 100
The above ratios for CCE derivatives were determined with
50 to 100 ng of sample. However, when the amount of CCE-
OGDZ was reduced to below 10 ng, no ion peaks were
detectable in the positive spectrum (scanned m/z 150-650),
but the M- ion was still pronounced in the negative spectrum.
Hence, the negative ion spectra are clearly preferable for
quantification ofthese derivatives, especially CCE derivatives,
because of the much greater sensitivity. The negative ion
spectra ofOGZ and CyE-OGZ exhibit prominent ions at m/
z 179 attributable to a glucosyloxy fragment ion.
Three types of evidence indicated that the CyE and CCE
moieties were attached to the purine ring at N-9 and not to
the sugar moiety. First, the UV spectra of the derivatives
differed from those ofN6-monosubstituted adenines and were
characteristic of N6,9-disubstituted adenines (Table II). Sec-
ond, ions in the mass spectra were indicative of cleavage to a
CyE-adenine or CCE-adenine, fragment ion. Thus, in the CI
spectra ofCyE OGZ and CyE OGDZ, ions are present at m/
z 189 (positive) and 187 (negative). The positive spectrum of
CCE OGZ shows a chlorine-containing fragment ion at m/z
223 (Table I). Third, when the CCE derivative ofOGDZ was
treated with ,3-glucosidase (6), it yielded an aglycone which
cochromatographed with the CCE derivative prepared directly
from DZ. This was identified as 9-CCE-DZ (see below). Both
compounds exhibited the same CI mass spectrum, which was
as follows: negative ion 308* (100, M-), 272 (30), 271 (25),
and 220 (11); positive ion 309* (100, MH+); an asterisk
denotes the presence of a chlorine isotope peak. The ion
current for the M- ion was 87 times that of the MH+ ion.
The CCE derivative ofDZ exhibited the following El mass
spectrum: m/z 308 (M+, 10), 291 (10), 277 (10), 249 (53),
235 (100), 222 (35), 199 (13), 186 (8), 179 (12), 161 (18), 160
(20), 149 (35), 148 (21), 135 (49). This establishes that the
CCE group is attached to the purine ring, and the UV spectra
indicate that this was N-9 (Table II).
Soybean leaf extracts were purified as a described before (6)
to yield an O-glucoside fraction. An aliquot (10%) was treated
with gB-glucosidase and the released Z, DZ, ZR, and DZR
were quantified by RIA (6). Ds O-glucosides were added to
the remaining 90% of the sample which was then further
purified (see "Materials and Methods") to separate the four
O-glucosides. By methods based on the mass spectra detailed
above, the endogenous intact O-glucosides were determined
by short scan PPINICI mass spectrometry using the negative
scans. OGDZ was quantified by three methods: directly, as
the CCE derivative, and as the CCE aglycone derived by ,B-
glucosidase hydrolysis (Table III; Fig. 1). The contents of
OGZ and OGDZ were very similar to those determined by
RIA. However, the levels of OGZR and OGDZR were too
low to permit an accurate comparison of the two methods
(Table III).
Negative ion mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive tech-
nique for quantification of cytokinin O-glucosides. For quan-
tification of the O-glucoside bases, OGZ and OGDZ, two
derivatives have been devised, namely CyE and CCE deriva-
tives. The latter with a chlorine atom is preferable as it yields,
by resonance capture ionization, an extremely intense molec-
ular ion allowing ready quantification of ng amounts by short
scan methods.
