, . Abstract-From the stems of Abicta pcthrii,  eight isoquinoline alkaloids were isolated and identified by spectroscopic 
methods and chemical correlations. Three of the bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are new and were assigned the 
structures 2'-N-nordaurisoline, 2-N-methyllindoldhamine and 2'-N-methyllindoldhamine. The other known alkaloids 
were coclaurine, daurisoline, lindoldhamine, dimethyllindoldhamine, stepharine and thalifoline. 
INTRODUC'IION 
The genus Abuta (Menispermaceae, Anomospermae) 
spreads widely throughout tropical America. Out of its 30 
species [l] only a few have been studied from a chemical 
point of view. They all contain isoquinoline alkaloids of 
several types, namely bis-benzylisoquinolines [2, 31, 
oxoaporphines [4,5], amfluoranthenes [5],  tropo- 
loisoquinolines [6] and isoquinolobenzazepines [7]. As 
A. pahni [SI is part of Amazonian curare mixtures, we 
thought it worthwhile carrying out the analysis of the 
alkaloidal composition of this species. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Extraction and separation of the non-quaternary al- 
kaloids, according to  a conventional process, led to the 
isolation, and characterization of eight alkaloids. Five of 
them are known, an  isoquinolone, thalifoline, a ben- 
zylisoquinoline, (+)-coclaurine, a proaporphine, ( +)- 
stepharine and two bis-benzylisoquinolines, (-)- 
daurisoline 1 and (-)-lindoldhamine 3. 
The three remaining alkaloids are new. They are all of 
the single bridged bis-benzylisoquinoline type, a s  sug- 
gested by mass spectroscopy by the very low intensity of 
the [Ml  * peak [9]. The ' H  NMR spectra (360 MHz, FT) 
(cf. Table 1) display much analogy. There appears, in 
particular, the constant presence of an ABX system, and of 
an A2B2 system, respectively, assigned to the protons in 
the 10,13,14 and 10',11',13',14' positions, a characteristic 
feature of the 11,12' single bridged bis-coclaurine [2, 31. 
Each of the three spectra also shows only one singlet 
assignable to a N-methyl group at ca 2.5 ppm. The other 
nitrogen atom is therefore engaged in a secondary amino 
function as established by the very strong deshielding of 
the 1- or l'-proton (CU 4.1-4.2 ppm). 
Alkaloid 2, C36H40NZ06, [MI* m/z 596, presents a 
'H NMR spectrum that differs little from that of dauris- 
oline 1. Methylation of 2 (HCHO-NaBH4) N o r d s  a 
compound identical in every respect to 1. The use of 
NOES helps establish the respective positions of the N-H 
and of the N-Me. Irradiation of the N-Me singlet 
induces a 4 increase of the signal at 3.61 ppm; when this 
last signal is irradiated, increases of 2 % on the H-8 signal 
(at 6.31 ppm) and of 1.2 on the doublet of the X proton 
of the ABX system in the ring C (H-10 at 6.49 ppm)can be 
observed. Therefore, the nitrogen in position 2 carries the 
methyl group and alkaloid 2 is assigned the structure 2'- 
N-nordaurisoline. 
Alkaloids 4 and 5 exhibit the same molecular formula 
C35133~N206, [MI" tn/z 582. Like 2, they both carry a 
secondary amino function, which on  methylation 
(HCHO-NaBH,) gives one product only, the ( - ) - N , N -  
dimethyllindoldhamine 6 ( = guattegaumerine [lo]), 
identified by comparison with authentic samples [ 1 I]. As 
above, the respective positions of the secondary amino 
and tertiary amino groups in alkaloid 4 are determined 
through NOE measurements (cf. values in the 
Experimental). It can then be given the structure 2-N- 
methyllindoldllamine. Consequently alkaloid 5 corres- 
ponds to 2-N-methyllindoldhamine. 
Like (-)-daurisoline 1 and (-)-lindoldhamine 3 the 
three new alkaloids have a 1RJ'R configuration as 
establishcd by the superimposability of their CD curves. 
Thus, A .  palmi displays an  array of isoquinoline al- 
kaloids close in composition to other Abuta species. Yet

EXPERIMENTAL 
Plant niaterial. Stems of Abicta pahtii (Martius) KrukoF and 
Barneby (1.5 kg) were collected in August 1984 by one of us (A.F.) 
in Alto-Beni, Marimono, Bolivia, at 850 m altitude. 
Extraction and chrotnatoyrap/iy. After removal of lipids with 
petrol, the stem powder was made alkaline and extracted with 
CHzCIz in a Soxhlet apparatus. The alkaloidal mixture was 
further purified by the usual acid-base treatment, then separated 
by EC on Merck 60 silica gel or by TLC on Merck 60 H silica gel 
and by prep. TLC on Merck HFZ5,, silica gel.
