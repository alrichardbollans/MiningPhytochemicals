We have investigated the anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of Cinnamomum cassia constituents (cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol,
cinnamic acid, and coumarin) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW264.7) and carrageenan
(Carr)-induced mouse paw edema model. When RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with cinnamic aldehyde together with
LPS, a signiﬁcant concentration-dependent inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2)levelsproductionsweredetected.Westernblottingrevealedthatcinnamicaldehydeblockedproteinexpressionofinducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB), and IκBα, signiﬁcantly. In
the anti-inﬂammatory test, cinnamic aldehyde decreased the paw edema after Carr administration, and increased the activities
of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the paw tissue. We also demonstrated
cinnamic aldehyde attenuated the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the edema paw after
Carr injection. Cinnamic aldehyde decreased the NO, TNF-α, and PGE2 levels on the serum level after Carr injection. Western
blotting revealed that cinnamic aldehyde decreased Carr-induced iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB expressions in the edema paw. These
ﬁndings demonstrated that cinnamic aldehyde has excellent anti-inﬂammatory activities and thus has great potential to be used as
a source for natural health products.
1.Introduction
Inﬂammation is recognized as a biological process in re-
sponse to tissue injury. At the injury site, an increase in
blood vessel wall permeability followed by migration of
immune cells can lead edema formation during inﬂamma-
tion[1].Inﬂammationleadstotheupregulationofaseriesof
enzymes and signaling proteins in aﬀected cells and tis-sues.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a member of the
NOS protein family, catalyzes the formation of nitric oxide
(NO) from L-arginine [2]. Low concentration of NO pro-
duced by iNOS is likely to contribute to the antimicrobial
activity of macrophages against certain bacterial pathogens.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin and a constituent
of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. LPS
stimulatesinnateimmunity, byregulatingtheproductionsof
inﬂammatorymediators, like,NO,TNF-α,andInterleukin-6
[3]. And in the animal the inﬂammation model of a carra-
geenan (Carr) induced edema is usually used to assess the
contribution of natural products in resisting the biochemical
changesassociatedwithacuteinﬂammation.Carrcaninduce
acute inﬂammation beginning with inﬁltration of phago-
cytes, the production of free radicals as well as the release of
inﬂammatory mediators [4]. The resulting inﬂammation has2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
been shown to be associated with a number of chronic dis-
eases, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inﬂammatory
bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease, and
also has a role in various human cancers [5].
Intracellular antioxidant mechanisms against these in-
ﬂammatory stresses involve antioxidant enzymes, including
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathio-
ne peroxidase (GPx) in tissues. Recently, it has been shown
that faulty cellular antioxidant systems cause organisms to
develop a series of inﬂammatory and cancer diseases [6].
However, it appears that the various roles of enzymatic
antioxidants help to protect organisms from excessive gener-
ation of oxidative stress in the inﬂammatory process, which
has triggered studies focusing on the role of natural products
in suppressing the production of oxidation by increasing
enzymatic antioxidants in tissues [7].
Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), bark, is the outer skin
of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Laurace-
ae. It is commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine
for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, blood circulation disturban-
ces, and inﬂammatory diseases. Its extracts contain several
active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde,
cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and coumarin), tannin,
mucus, and carbohydrates [8]. C. cassia has been shown to
have many pharmacological properties, such as antiulcero-
genic, anti-inﬂammatory, antipyretic, antimicrobial, antidi-
abetic and antitumor activity [9, 10]. However, in this paper
we examined that cinnamic aldehyde was the most potent
anti-inﬂammatory constituent of C. cassia on LPS-induced
in RAW264.7 cells and Carr-induced on paw edema in
mice. And we detected the levels of iNOS, COX-2, and
NF-κB in either RAW264.7 cell or paw edema. Also, the
activities of CAT, SOD, and GPx in the paw tissue at the
5thh after Carr injection were measured to understand the
relationship between the anti-inﬂammatory mechanism of
cinnamic aldehyde and antioxidant enzymes.

100ng/mL of LPS in the absence or presence of samples (0, 6.25,
12.5, 25, and 50μM). Samples were added 1h before incubation
with LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Cell viability assay was performed
using MTT assay. The data were presented as mean ± S.D. for three
diﬀerent experiments performed in triplicate.
experiment. They were given food and water ad libitum.
All experimental procedures were performed according to
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In addition, all tests
were conducted under the guidelines of the International
Association for the Study of Pain.
After a 2-week adaptation period, male ICR mice (18–
25g) were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 6) of
the animals in the study. The control group receives normal
saline (i.p.). The other three groups include a Carr-treated,
a positive control (Carr + Indo), and cinnamic aldehyde ad-
ministered groups (Carr + cinnamic aldehyde).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3
2.3. Cell Culture. A murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7
(BCRC no. 60001) was purchased from the Bioresources
Collection and Research Center (BCRC) of the Food Indus-
try Research and Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan).
Cells were cultured in plastic dishes containing Dulbecco’s
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Sigma, USA) in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2 in air) at 37◦C
and subcultured every 3 days at a dilution of 1:5 using
0.05% trypsin—0.02% EDTA in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free phos-
phate-buﬀered saline (DPBS).
2.4. Cell Viability. Cells (2 × 105) were cultured in 96-
well plate containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
for 1 day to become nearly conﬂuent. Then cells were cul-
tured with cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cinna-
mic acid, and coumarin in the presence of 100ng/mL
LPS (lipopolysaccharide) for 24h. After that, the cells were
washed twice with DPBS and incubated with 100μLo f
0.5mg/mL MTT for 2h at 37 ◦C testing for cell viability
{MTT, (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoli-
um bromide)}. The medium was then discarded and 100μL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added. After 30-min incu-
bation, absorbance at 570nm was read using a microplate
reader.
2.5. Measurement of Nitric Oxide/Nitrite. NO production
was indirectly assessed by measuring the nitrite levels in
the cultured media and serum determined by a colorimetric
method based on the Griess reaction [4]. The cells were
incubated with cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cin-
namic acid, coumarin (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50μM) in
the presence of LPS (100ng/mL) at 37◦C for 24h. Then,
cells were dispensed into 96-well plates, and 100mL of each
supernatant was mixed with the same volume of Griess
reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthyl ethylenediamine
dihydrochloride and 5% phosphoric acid) and incubated at
room temperature for 10min, the absorbance was measured
at 540nm with a Micro-Reader (Molecular Devices, Orleans
Drive, Sunnyvale, CA). Serum samples were diluted four
times with distilled water and deproteinized by adding 1/20
volume of zinc sulfate (300g/L) to a ﬁnal concentration
of 15g/L. After centrifugation at 10,000×g for 5min at
room temperature, 100μL supernatant was applied to a
microtiter plate well, followed by 100μL of Griess reagent.
After 10min of color development at room temperature, the
absorbance was measured at 540nm with a Micro-Reader.
By using sodium nitrite to generate a standard curve, the
concentration of nitrite was measured by absorbance at
540nm.
2.6. Carr-Induced Edema. The Carr-induced hind paw ede-
ma model was used for determination of anti-inﬂammatory
activity[1].Animalswerei.p.treatedwithcinnamicaldehyde
(1.25, 2.5 and 5mg/kg), Indo or normal saline, 30min prior
to injection of 1% Carr (50μL) in the plantar side of right
hind paws of the mice. The paw volume was measured
after Carr injection and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5h intervals
after the administration of the edematogenic agent using
a plethysmometer (model 7159, Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy).
The degree of swelling induced was evaluated by the ratio
a/b,w h e r ea is the volume of the right hind paw after Carr
treatment, and b is the volume of the right hind paw before
Carr treatment. Indo was used as a positive control. After
5h, the animals were sacriﬁced and the Carr-induced edema
feet were dissected and stored at −80◦C. Also, blood was
withdrawn and kept at −80◦C. The protein concentration
of the sample was determined by the Bradford dye-binding
assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
2.7. MDA Assay. MDA from Carr-induced edema foot was
evaluated by the thiobarbituric acid reacting substance
(TRARS) method [1]. Brieﬂy, MDA reacted with thiobarbi-
turic acid in the acidic high temperature and formed a red-
complex TBARS. The absorbance of TBARS was determined
at 532nm.
2.8. Myeloperoxidase Activity Assay. The activity of tissue
MPO was assessed at the 5thh after injection of Carr into
the mouse right hind paw according to the method of Bani
et al. [11] with some modiﬁcations. Samples were placed in
0.75mL of 80mM phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS), pH 5.4,
and then homogenized in a motor-driven homogenizer. The
homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000×ga t4 ◦C for 15min.
Triplicate 0.1mL of supernatant with 2.9mL of potassium
phosphate buﬀer (50mM, pH 6) containing 0.19mg/mL of
o-dianisidinechlorideand0.0005%H2O2 wasasubstratefor
myeloperoxidase. Oxidized o-dianisidine formed a soluble
chromophore and absorbance (OD460) was determined by
spectrophotometry (Molecular Devices, Orleans Drive, Sun-
nyvale, CA) over 2min. Myeloperoxidase activity (ΔOD460)
was calculated by subtracting the value of OD460 at time
0min from that at 2min for each sample.
2.9. Measurement of TNF-α and PGE2 by an Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The levels of TNF-α and
PGE2 were determined using a commercially available ELISA
kit (Biosource International Inc., Camarillo, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. TNF-α and PGE2 were
determined from a standard curve.
2.10. Antioxidant Enzyme Activity Measurements. The fol-
lowing biochemical parameters were analyzed to check the
paw tissues activity of cinnamic aldehyde by the methods
given below.
Total SOD activity was determined by the inhibition of
cytochrome c reduction [12]. The reduction of cytochrome
c was mediated by superoxide anions generated by the
xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and monitored at 550nm.
One unit of SOD was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme
required to inhibit the rate of cytochrome c reduction
by 50%. Total CAT activity was based on that of Aebi
[13]. In brief, the reduction of 10mM H2O2 in 20mM of
phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.0) was monitored by measuring the
absorbance at 240nm. The activity was calculated using a
molar absorption coeﬃcient, and the enzyme activities were4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
deﬁned as nanomoles of dissipating hydrogen peroxide per
milligram protein per minute. Total GPx activity in cytosol
was determined according to Paglia and Valentine’s method
[14].Theenzymesolutionwasaddedtoamixturecontaining
hydrogen peroxide and glutathione in 0.1mM Tris buﬀer
(pH 7.2) and the absorbance at 340nm was measured.

macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells were washed with PBS
and lysed in an ice-cold lysis buﬀer (10% glycerol, 1% Triton

inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)) on
ice for 1h, followed by centrifugation at 12,000rpm for
30min at 4◦C. Soft tissues were removed from individual
mice paws and homogenized in a solution containing 10mM
CHAPS, 1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF),
5μg/mL, aprotinin, 1μM pepstatin and 10μM leupeptin.
The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000g for 20min,
and 30μg of protein from the supernatants was then separat-
ed on 10% sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes. After transfer, the membrane was blocked for
2h at room temperature with 5% skim milk in Tris-buﬀered
saline-Tween (TBST; 20mM Tris, 500mM NaCl, pH 7.5,
0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with
mouse monoclonal anti-iNOS, anti-COX-2, anti-IκBα, or
anti-NF-κB antibody in 5% skim milk in TBST for 2h at
room temperature. The membranes were washed three times
with TBST at room temperature and then incubated with
a 1:2000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, U.S.A.) in 2.5% skim milk in TBST for 1h at room
temperature. The membranes were washed three times and
the immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) using hyperﬁlm and ECL reagent
(Amersham International plc., Buckinghamshire, UK). The
results of Western blot analysis were quantiﬁed by measuring
the relative intensity compared to the control using Kodak
Molecular Imaging Software (Version 4.0.5, Eastman Kodak
Company, Rochester, NY) and represented in the relative
intensities.
2.12. Histological Examination. For histological examina-
tion, biopsies of paws were taken 5h following the inter-
planetary injection of Carr. The tissue slices were ﬁxed in a
solution (1.85% formaldehyde, 1% acetic acid) for 1 week
at room temperature, dehydrated by graded ethanol and
embedded in Paraﬃn (Sherwood Medical). Sections (thick-
ness 5μm) were deparaﬃnized with xylene and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. All samples
were observed and photographed with BH-2 Olympus
microscopy. Every 3∼5 tissue slices were randomly chosen
from Carr, Indo and cinnamic aldehyde-treated (5mg/kg)
groups. Histological examination of these tissue slices re-
vealed an excessive inﬂammatory response with massive in-
ﬁltration of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMNs)) by microscopy. The numbers of neutrophils were
counted in each scope (400x) and thereafter obtain their
average count from 5 scopes of every tissue slice [15].
2.13. Statistical Analysis. Data are expressed as mean ±
standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical evaluation was
carried out by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA fol-
lowedbyScheﬀe’smultiplerangetest).Statisticalsigniﬁcance
is expressed as ∗P<0.05, ∗∗P<0.01, ∗∗∗P<0.001.
3. Results
3.1. Cell Viability. The eﬀect of C. cassia constituents (cin-
namic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and
coumarin) on RAW264.7 cell viability was determined by a
MTT assay. Cells cultured with samples at the concentra-
tions (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50μM) used in the presence
of 100ng/mL LPS for 24h did not change cell viability
(Figure 1(b)).
3.2. Eﬀect of Cinnamic Aldehyde, Cinnamic Alcohol, Cinna-
mic Acid, and Coumarin on LPS-Induced NO Produc-
tion in Macrophages. In the present study, eﬀects of cin-
namic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and
coumarin on LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7
macrophages were investigated. Nitrite accumulated in the
culture medium was estimated by the Griess reaction as
an index for NO release from the cells. After treatment
with LPS (100ng/mL) for 24h, the nitrite concentration
increased in the medium. When RAW264.7 macrophages
were treated with diﬀerent concentrations of cinnamic
aldehyde together with LPS for 24h, the cinnamic alde-
hyde inhibited nitrite production signiﬁcantly (Figure 2).
Cinnamic aldehyde did not interfere with the reaction
between nitrite and Griess reagents at 50μM (data not
shown). Unstimulated macrophages, after 24h of incubation
in culture medium produced background levels of nitrite.
When RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with diﬀerent
concentrations of cinnamic aldehyde (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and
50μM) together with LPS (100ng/mL) for 24h, a signiﬁcant
concentration-dependent inhibition of nitrite production
was detected. There was either a signiﬁcant decrease in the
nitrite production of group treated with 12.5μM cinnamic
aldehyde (P<0.05), or very or highly signiﬁcant decrease of
groups treated, respectively, with 25 or 50μM of cinnamic
aldehyde when compared with the LPS-alone group (P<
0.01 or P<0.001). The IC50 value for inhibition of nitrite
production of cinnamic aldehyde was about 45.56±1.36μM.

the inhibition of NO production was due to a decreased

COX-2, IκBα, and NF-κB proteins expression in mouse
macrophage RAW264.7 cells in the cytosol (Figures 3(a) and
4(a)). The detection of β-actin was also performed in the
same blot as an internal control. The intensity of protein
bands was analyzed by using Kodak Quantity software in
three independent experiments and it showed an average of
77.4% and 84.8% downregulation of iNOS and COX-2 pro-
teins, respectively, after treatment with cinnamic aldehyde at
50μMc o m p a r e dw i t ht h eL P S - a l o n e( Figure 3(b)). And the

(IL-6) [16]. We examined the eﬀect of cinnamic aldehyde on
LPS induced upregulation of TNF-α. A very low amount of
TNF-α protein was detected by a speciﬁc ELISA for TNF-α in
controls (Figure 5(a)). When RAW264.7 macrophages were

cinnamic aldehyde (12.5, 25, and 50μM) together with LPS
(100ng/mL) for 24h, a signiﬁcant concentration-dependent
inhibition of PGE2 production was detected. The IC50 value
for inhibition of PGE2 production of cinnamic aldehyde was
about 37.67 ±0.58μM.
3.5. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on Carr-Induced Mice Paw
Edema. In this study, we used Carr-induced edema because
this model is widely employed for screening the eﬀects of
anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Carr-induced paw edema is shown
in Figure 6(a). Cinnamic aldehyde (5mg/kg) inhibited (P<
0.001) the development of paw edema induced by Carr
after the 4th and the 5thh of treatment, signiﬁcantly. Indo
(10mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased the Carr-induced paw
edema after the 4th and the 5thh of treatment (P<0.001).
3.6. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on the MDA Level. The
MDA level increased signiﬁcantly in the edema paw at the
5thh after Carr injection (P<0.001). However, the MDA
level was decreased signiﬁcantly by treatment with cinnamic
aldehyde (5mg/kg) (P<0.001), as well as 10mg/kg Indo
(Figure 6(b)).
3.7. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on the MPO Activity. The
MPO activity increased signiﬁcantly in the edema paw at the
5thh after Carr injection (P<0.001). However, the MPO
activity was decreased signiﬁcantly by the treatment with
cinnamicaldehyde(5mg/kg)(P<0.001),aswellas10mg/kg
Indo (Figure 6(c)).
3.8. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on the NO Level. In
Figure 6(d),theNOlevelincreasedsigniﬁcantlyintheedema
serumatthe5thhafterCarr injection (P<0.001). Cinnamic
aldehyde (5mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased the serum NO
level (P<0.001). The inhibitory potency was similar to that
of Indo (10mg/kg) at the 5thh after induction.
3.9. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on the TNF-α and PGE2
Level. The TNF-α and PGE2 level increased signiﬁcantly in
serum at the 5thh after Carr injection (P<0.001). However,
cinnamic aldehyde (1.25 or 2.5mg/kg) decreased the TNF-
α and PGE2 level in serum at the 5thh after Carr injection
(P<0.05 or P<0.01), as well as 10mg/kg Indo (Figures 6(e)
and 6(f)).
3.10. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on Activities of Antioxi-
dant Enzymes. At the 5thh after the intrapaw injection of
Carr, paw tissues were also analyzed for the biochemical
parameters such as CAT, SOD, and GPx activities. CAT,
SOD, and GPx activities in paw tissue were decreased
signiﬁcantly by Carr administration. CAT, SOD, and GPx
activity were increased signiﬁcantly after being treated with
5mg/kg cinnamic aldehyde and 10mg/kg Indo (P<0.01 or
P<0.001) (Table 1).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7

3.11. Eﬀects of Cinnamic Aldehyde on Carr-Induced iNOS,
COX-2, and NF-κB Protein Expressions in Mice Paw Edema.
To investigate whether the inhibition of NO production
was due to a decreased iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κBp r o t e i n
level, the eﬀect of cinnamic aldehyde on iNOS, COX-2,
and NF-κB proteins expression was studied by western blot.
The results showed that injection of cinnamic aldehyde
(5mg/kg) on Carr-induced for 5h inhibited iNOS, COX-
2, and NF-κB proteins expression in mouse paw edema
(Figure 7(a)). The detection of β-actin was also performed
in the same blot as an internal control. The intensity
of protein bands was analyzed by using Kodak Quantity
software in three independent experiments and showed an
average of 76.1% and 63.3% downregulation of iNOS and
COX-2 protein, respectively, after treatment with cinnamic
aldehyde at 5mg/kg compared with the Carr-induced alone
(Figure 7(b)). In addition, the protein expression showed
an average of 57.1% and 45.1% down-regulation of iNOS,
and COX-2 protein after treatment with Indo at 10mg/kg
compared with the Carr-induced alone (Figure 7(b)). And
the intensity of protein bands showed an average of 87.6%
upregulation of NF-κBp r o t e i n( P<0.001) (Figure 7(b)).
The down-regulation of iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κBa c t i v i t y
of the cinnamic aldehyde (5mg/kg) was better than Indo
(10mg/kg).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated anti-inﬂammatory
activities of C. cassia constituents (cinnamic aldehyde, cin-
namic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and coumarin) in both in in
vitroand in vivo experimental systems, using LPS-stimulated
RAW264.7 macrophages and a mouse model of topical
inﬂammation, respectively. Dual inhibitory activities against
iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB as shown in in vitro assays appear10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
to confer on cinnamic aldehyde a potent in vivo eﬃcacy in
mouse, Carr-induced, paw edema, comparable with a potent
COX inhibitor, indomethacin, suggesting its potential thera-
peutic usage as a novel topical anti-inﬂammatory source of
health food.
The pathology of inﬂammation is initiated by complex
processes triggered by microbial pathogens such as LPS,
which is a prototypical endotoxin. LPS can directly activate
macrophages, which trigger the production of inﬂammatory
mediators, such as NO and TNF-α [17]. The pharmacolog-
ical reduction of LPS-inducible inﬂammatory mediators is
regarded as one of the essential conditions to alleviate a vari-
ety of disorders caused by activation of macrophages. Thus,
RAW264.7 macrophages provide us with an good model
for anti-inﬂammatory drug screening and for subsequently
evaluating the inhibitors of the signal pathways that lead
to the induction of proinﬂammatory enzymes and to the
production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.
Cinnamic aldehyde, the major constituent of leaf essen-
tial oil from C. cassia. Cinnamic aldehyde has been demon-
strated to exhibit antitumor activities, antibacteria activities,
anti-LPS-induced NF-κB transcriptional activities [18, 19].
Cinnamic aldehyde which has α, β unsaturated carbonyl
moiety exerted suppressive eﬀect on toll-like-receptor-4-
(TLR4-) mediated signaling [20]. And in this paper, we
ﬁrst evaluated that cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and
coumarin have only little or less anti-inﬂammatory activities
in LPS-inducible inﬂammatory model in vitro.O u rc u r r e n t
results provided a potential medical application in modulat-
ing inﬂammatory diseases.
As many of these conditions exhibit rapid onset and
development, often resulting in the failure of conventional
anti-inﬂammatory therapies and extremely high mortality
rates, a simultaneous suppression of NO production path-
ways, as shown by cinnamic aldehyde, may satisfy the so
far unmet need for control of the rapid progression of the
inﬂammatory process. In vitro models such as macrophage
cells or other cell lines are useful materials with a steady
high-level production of NO. The mechanisms by which
cinnamic aldehyde inhibits macrophage functions have not
been elucidated. Results in vitro showed that cinnamic
aldehyde suppressed LPS-induced production of NO, the
expression of inﬂammatory protein products such as iNOS,
COX-2, IκBα,a n dN F - κB. Examination of the cytotoxicity
of cinnamic aldehyde in RAW264.7 macrophages using MTT
assay has indicated that cinnamic aldehyde even at 50μM
did not aﬀect the viability of RAW264.7 cells. Therefore,
inhibition of LPS-induced nitrite production by cinnamic
aldehyde was not the result of a possible cytotoxic eﬀect on
these cells.
Excess amounts of NO and PGE2 play a critical role
in the aggravation of chronic inﬂammatory diseases, such
as hepatic dysfunction and pulmonary disease. Recently,
in vitro and in vivo have indicated an existing cross talk
between the release of NO and prostaglandins (PGs) in
the modulation of molecular mechanisms that regulate PGs
generating pathway [21]. Scientiﬁc papers observed that
while the production of both NO and PGE2 was blocked by
the NOS inhibitors in mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells,
these inhibitory eﬀects were reversed by coincubation with
the precursor of NO synthesis, L-Arginine. Furthermore,
inhibition of iNOS activity by nonselective NOS inhibitors
attenuatedthereleaseofNOandPGssimultaneouslyinLPS-
activated macrophages, which suggested that endogenously
released NO from macrophages exerted a stimulatory action
on enhancing the PGs production. Conversely, it has been
shown that COX activation in turn modulates L-arginine-
NOpathway,whereasCOXinhibitiondecreasesNOSactivity
in human platelets [22]. These results are indicative of the
cross-talk between NO and PGs pathways.
The Carr-induced mice paw edema is a suitable test for
evaluating anti-inﬂammatory drugs and has frequently been
used to assess the antiedematous eﬀect of natural products
[23]. The degree of swelling of the Carr-injected paws was
maximal 3thh after injection. Cinnamic aldehyde and Indo
signiﬁcantly inhibited the development of edema the 4th and
the 5thh after treatment (P<0.001). They both showed
anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects in Carr-induced mice edema paw.
It is well known that the third phase of the edemainduced
by Carr, in which the edema reaches its highest volume, is
characterized by the presence of prostaglandins and other
compounds of slow reaction found that the injection of Carr
into the rat paw induces the liberation of bradykinin, which
later induces the biosynthesis of prostaglandin and other
autacoids, which are responsible for the formation of the
inﬂammatory exudates [24].
In the studies of the mechanism on the inﬂammation,
NO plays an important role in the Carr-induced inﬂamma-
tory response [25]. Our present results conﬁrm that Carr-
induced paw edema model results in the production of NO.
The expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase has
been proposed as an important mediator of inﬂammation.
In our study, the level of NO was decreased signiﬁcantly by
treatmentwith1.25,2.5,and5mg/kgcinnamicaldehyde.We
suggest the anti-inﬂammatory mechanism of cinnamic alde-
hyde may be through the L-arginine-NO pathway because
cinnamic aldehyde signiﬁcantly inhibits the NO production.
The proinﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-
1 are small secreted proteins, which mediate and regulate
immunity and inﬂammation. The production of TNF-α is
crucial for the synergistic induction of NO synthesis in
LPS-stimulated macrophages. TNF-α induces a number of
physiological eﬀects including septic shock, inﬂammation,
and cytotoxicity [26]. Also, TNF-α is a mediator of Carr-
induced inﬂammatory incapacitation and is able to induce
the further release of kinins, and leukotrienes, which is
suggested to have an important role in the maintenance
of long-lasting nociceptive response [27]. In this study, we
found that cinnamic aldehyde decreased the TNF-α level in
serum after Carr injection by treatment with 1.25, 2.5, and
5mg/kg, signiﬁcantly.
Neutrophils and macrophages are critical to the patho-
genesis of acute injury, rheumatoid arthritis and other
inﬂammatorydiseases[15].TheCarr-induced inﬂammatory
response has been linked to neutrophils inﬁltration and
the production of neutrophils-derived free radicals, such as
hydrogen peroxide as well as the release of other neutrophils-
derived mediators [1]. Some researches demonstrate thatEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11
inﬂammatory eﬀect induced by Carr is associated with free
radical. Free radical, prostaglandin, and NO will be released
when administrating with Carr for 1 ∼ 6h. ROS play an
important role in modulating the extent of inﬂammatory
response and consequent tissue and cell injury. MDA is a
metabolic product of lipid peroxidation, the level of which
is raised in oxidative stress. MDA production is due to free
radicalattackplasmamembrane.Increasingevidenceregard-
ing free radical-generating agents and inﬂammatory pro-
cesses suggests that accumulation of reactive oxygen species
cancausetissueinjury[28].Thus,inﬂammatoryeﬀectwould
result in the accumulation of MDA. In this study, there
is signiﬁcant increase in CAT, SOD, and GPx activities
with cinnamic aldehyde treatment. Furthermore, there are
signiﬁcant decreases in MDA level with cinnamic aldehyde
treatment. We assume the suppression of MDA production
is probably due to the increases of CAT, SOD, and GPx
activities.
Activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)
reﬂects a primary immunological response to invading path-
ogens [29]. In Carr-induced inﬂammation, cinnamic alde-
hyde signiﬁcantly inhibited cellular inﬁltration (neutrophils
and granulocytes) into the air-pouch ﬂuid. Also, MPO from
the neutrophil’s azurophilic granules is responsible for in-
voking tissue injury [30]. Results indicate that cinnamic
aldehydehasconsiderablepotentialasatherapeuticinhibitor
of MPO-mediated tissue damage.
NF-κB is known to be a major transcription factor to
regulate the expressions of pro-inﬂammatory enzymes and
cytokines, such as iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α [31]. NF-κB
subunits (p65 and/or p50) are normally sequestered in the
cytosol as an inactive complex by binding to inhibitory
factor IκB-α in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation of pro-
inﬂammatorysignalsincludingLPS,IκB-αisphosphorylated
by IκB kinase (IKK) and inactivated through ubiquitin-
mediated degradation [32]. The resulting free NF-κBi s
translocated into the nucleus and it acts as a transcription
factor. As shown in Figure 4(a), the treatment with cinnamic
aldehyde blocks the degradation of NF-κB in LPS-induced
macrophage and Carr-induced paw edema. Therefore, these
resultssuggestthatcinnamicaldehydeinhibitstheexpression
of iNOS and COX-2, and thus NO production through
inactivation of NF-κB activation.
The anti-inﬂammatory properties of cinnamic aldehyde
would appear to be similar to the anti-inﬂammatory proper-
ties of certain other essential oils deriving from certain other
plants. Hyptis pectinata essential oil exhibits antinociceptive
and anti-inﬂammatory activity through the inhibition of
NO and PGE2 production after Carr injection [33]. And,
the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea signiﬁcantly decreased
TNF-a production in Carr-injected rat paws [34].
In conclusion, these results suggested that cinnamic
aldehyde possessed anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects. The anti-in-
ﬂammatorymechanismofcinnamicaldehydemayberelated
to iNOS and it is associated with the increase in the activities
of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and GPx). Cinnamic
aldehyde may be used as a pharmacological agent in the pre-
vention or treatment of disease in which free radical forma-
