SP (Brazil)(Received September 3, I960; accepted September 12. 1980)SummaryAmong the three South American Lauraceae with cinnamon odours, Ocotea quixos Lam. is distinguished with the richest historical legacy. Cin- namaldehyde, its odoriferous principle, occurs besides o-methoxycinnamalde- hyde, cinnamic acid and methyl cinnamate in the fruit calyx. In contradis­tinction, l-nitro-2-phenyIethane is responsible for the cinnamon odour of bark and leaves of Aniba cane I ilia (H.B.K.) Mez and Ocotea pretiosa (Nees) Mez.History and botanyCinnamon country (pats de la cane la) was the name conferred by Francisco Pizarro to the east Andean slopes covered by a dense tropica! jungle (Zarate, 1947; Fernandez de Oviedo, 1959). The desire to exploit its riches (Velasco, 1977 - 1979) motivated the establishment of a settlement, Canelos, on an affluent of the river Napo and the epic voyage of 1540, during which Francisco Orellana reported having fought woman warriors (hence the name given to the river Amazonas), and which took him and his soldiers to the Atlantic coast and thence back to their Spanish homeland.American cinnamon (canela americana) (Cobo, 1891; Fernandez de Oviedo, 1959), the tree which produces ishpingo (or espingo), the odorous fruit calyx presented by the Incaic emperor Atahualpa to Pizarro (Gonzalez Suarez, 1969), grows spontaneously, and is now also cultivated in the humid, subtropical and tropical valleys, called prouincias de la canella, of oriental234Ecuador. The epithets of its scientific names Ocotea quixos Lam. (Paredes, 1967), syn. Nectandra cinnamomoides Nees (Sodiro, 1850), refer respectively to Quijos, the valley situated closest to Quito, and to the odour of the species. The trivial designation cspingo seems to be applied equally to products from several quite unrelated plants, for example Quararibea sp. (Bombacaceae) and Gnaphalium dysodes Spreng. (Compositae) (Wassen, 1979).Already at Incaic times, ishpingo was reputed as medicine and as spice. Its aromatizing properties, rather than any hallucinogenic effect probably due to other plant material (Naranjo, 1969,1970), motivated its addition to ritual beverages. Even in contemporary’ Ecuador it continues to be a highly valued article of trade, still being used not only in traditional medicine as an apetizer, eupeptic, antidiarrheal, disinfectant and local anaesthetic, but also very generally as a spice. As such it is an obligatory ingredient of alajua (an alcoholic beverage based on fermented cornflour and added dark brown molasses) and of mazamorra morada (a dessert based on dark violet com). Both preparations are offered in honour of a family’s ancestors, undoubtedly a religious syncretism (de Villagomes, 1919; de Arriaga, 1920).Another historical account on "cinnamon" from South America refers to Alexander von Humbolt’s "famous cinnamon of the Orinoco” encountered during his and Aime Bonpland’s 1800 expedition, on and near Mount Canelillo. Carolus Mez (1889), who designated the species Aniba canelilla (H.B.K.) Mez, described additionally Ocotea pretiosa (Nees) Mez from the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro in the following terms: "Expirat quidem odorem cinnamomi et ab incolis canella nuncupatur, sed quae de plante virtute scripta, omnia fere ad Anibam canelillam, adhuc com ea confusam defer* Miriam."ChemistryThe odoriferous principle of both the pan-Amazonian Aniba canelilla (Gottlieb and Magalhaes, 1960) and the cinnamon smelling variety of Ocotea pretiosa (Gottlieb et al., 1962a), is l-nitro-2-phonylethane (Gottlieb and Magalhaes, 1959) whose decomposition gives hydrocyanic acid (Gottlieb et al., 1962b, 1963). Indeed the bark of Aniba canelilla (casca preciosa) is reported to be used only occasionally in popular perfumery and in the pre­paration of a “stimulating tea” (Ducke, 1938).The three cinnamons, A. canelilla, O. pretiosa and O. quixos, all belong to the Lauraceae family. Is O. quixos characterized by the same singular chemical composition of the other two species? The answer to this question is, fortunately for past and future consumers, negative. A chemical analysis of ishpingo revealed the presence of cinnamaldehyde, o-methoxycinnamalde- hyde, cinnamic acid and methyl cinnamate.With respect to its odorous fraction, “american cinnamon” is thus similar to the traditional spice derived from Cinnamomum zcylanicum Blume.235ExperimentalFloral calyxes of Ocotea quixos (identified at the Institute of Natural Sciences, University of Quito) were collected in the Quijos region, Ecuador, dried and powdered. The ethyl acetate extract (50 g) of the powder (900 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (1 kg). Successive elution with mixtures of hexane and benzene (9:1, 8:2, 6:4, 3:7) and of benzene-ethyl acetate (8:2) gave five fractions. The first fraction was composed mainly of aliphatic material (16 g). The second fraction was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (benzene-ethyl acetate, 9:1) to yield methyl cinnamate (1.6 g). The third fraction was crystallized from hexane to yield cinnamaldehyde (17 g). The fourth fraction was puri­fied by preparative TLC (silica gel, benzene-ethyl acetate 17:3). The product was crystallized from hexane to yield cinnamaldehyde (0.5 g). The mother liquor gave o-methoxycinnamaldehyde (50 mg). The fifth fraction, washed with hexane and benzene, gave cinnamic acid (1 g).All compounds were identified by melting point and spectra (infrared, ultraviolet,1H nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry). The identi­fications were confirmed by direct comparison with authentic samples.AcknowledgementsThe authors are indebted to the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Itamaraty) and to the Conselho National de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for fellowships (to A.K., on leave of absence from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand), and to Fundatjao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) for financial aid.ReferencesCoho, B., Historia del Nuevo Mundo, Editora Rasco, Sevilla, 1891.de Arriaga, 1*.
