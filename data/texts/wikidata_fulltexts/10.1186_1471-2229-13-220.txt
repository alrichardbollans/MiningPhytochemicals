Background: The medicinal plant Artemisia annua is covered with filamentous trichomes and glandular, artemisinin
producing trichomes. A high artemisinin supply is needed at a reduced cost for treating malaria. Artemisinin
production in bioreactors can be facilitated if a better insight is obtained in the biosynthesis of artemisinin and
other metabolites. Therefore, metabolic activities of glandular and filamentous trichomes were investigated at the
transcriptome level.
Results: By laser pressure catapulting, glandular and filamentous trichomes as well as apical and sub-apical cells
from glandular trichomes were collected and their transcriptome was sequenced using Illumina RNA-Seq. A de novo
transcriptome was assembled (Trinity) and studied with a differential expression analysis (edgeR).
A comparison of the transcriptome from glandular and filamentous trichomes shows that MEP, MVA, most terpene
and lipid biosynthesis pathways are significantly upregulated in glandular trichomes. Conversely, some transcripts
coding for specific sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid enzymes such as 8-epi-cedrol synthase and an uncharacterized
oxidosqualene cyclase were significantly upregulated in filamentous trichomes. All known artemisinin biosynthesis genes
are upregulated in glandular trichomes and were detected in both the apical and sub-apical cells of the glandular
trichomes. No significant differential expression could be observed between the apical and sub-apical cells.
Conclusions: Our results underscore the vast metabolic capacities of A. annua glandular trichomes but nonetheless
point to the existence of specific terpene metabolic pathways in the filamentous trichomes. Candidate genes that
might be involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are proposed based on their putative function and their differential
expression level.

Artemisia annua L. (Sweet Wormwood) is a medicinal
plant that produces artemisinin which is a sesquiterpene
with anti-malarial properties. Since every year around 216
million people are infected with malaria [1], a high supply
of artemisinin is needed at a reduced cost. Artemisinin
production is being enhanced in A. annua by crossing
high-producing plants [2]. Another strategy to increase
production of artemisinin is synthesis of artemisinic-acid
in engineered yeast and subsequent (photo)chemical
conversion to artemisinin [3,4]. A better insight in* Correspondence: Dieter.Deforce@UGent.be

method.
An important breakthrough unravelling artemisinin
biosynthesis, was the localization of artemisinin production
in the glandular trichomes [5]. Trichomes, named after the
Greek word for hair are epidermal outgrowths covering
plant organs. In A. annua, two types of trichomes are
present: biseriate peltate glandular trichomes (Figure 1A)
and filamentous trichomes composed of stalk cells and
an elongated cell in a T-shape (Figure 1B) [6]. Duke et al.
compared a normal biotype of A. annua with both fila-
mentous and glandular trichomes to a biotype with
only filamentous trichomes. Only in the presence of
glandular trichomes, artemisinin was detected [5].l Ltd. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220This information was used to discover candidate genes
for artemisinin biosynthesis with an expressed sequence
tag (EST) approach [7]. Three EST libraries were con-
structed: glandular trichome, flower bud and glandular
trichome-minus-flower-bud subtracted library. Several
genes that were preferentially expressed in glandular
trichomes are involved in artemisinin biosynthesis such
as CYP71AV1, ALDH1, DBR2 and ADH1 [7-10].
Enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are known
up to the formation of dihydroartemisinic acid. It is not
yet clear whether the last step(s) from dihydroartemisinic
acid to artemisinin involves a spontaneous auto-oxidation
or is catalyzed by enzymes. Brown and Sy favour the
theory of spontaneous chemistry because they see parallels
between in vitro auto-oxidation and intermediates
present in vivo [11]. Additionally, plants fed with labelled
dihydroartemisinic acid and dried, contained the same
proportion of labelled artemisinin as plants that were
kept alive [11]. These are the main arguments for
chemical conversion. On the other hand, while 70% of
label incorporation was detected in the metabolites
derived from dihydroartemisinic acid; artemisinin and
arteannuin H had only 5-15% label incorporation [11].
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that there is another
more important pathway leading to artemisinin which
was not accessible by the labelled precursor and thatenzymes might be involved to catalyze this process in
A. annua.
To find candidate genes that catalyze the last step(s)
to artemisinin, a more detailed analysis was needed of
the transcriptome of glandular trichomes. Sequencing
of the transcriptome from enriched glandular trichome
preparations from A. annua was performed by Graham
et al. on the Roche 454 platform to identify genes and
markers for fast-track breeding [2]. In another study,
Wang et al. performed a global transcriptome character-
ization of glandular trichomes. To confirm the expression
of some genes in glandular trichomes a semi-quantitative
RT-PCR analysis was performed on filamentous and
glandular trichomes. Three genes involved in terpene
biosynthesis were tested: amorpha-4,11-diene synthase,
a sesquiterpene cyclase and (3R)-linalool synthase. They
found that these genes were expressed in glandular tri-
chomes as well as in filamentous trichomes [12] and this
raised the question whether filamentous trichomes are
involved in the production of secondary metabolites.
Trichomes are in general classified as non-glandular
(e.g. filamentous trichomes in A. annua) or glandular,
based on their secretory capacity. In plants, glandular
trichomes are most often production sites for multiple
secondary metabolites which form a first-line defence at
the surface of the plant through their capacity to entrap,
Soetaert et al. BMC Plant Biology 2013, 13:220 Page 3 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220deter or poison pathogens and herbivores [13]. Because
of their interesting metabolite content as illustrated
with artemisinin, a large number of studies have been
devoted to glandular trichomes.
In contrast to the extensive literature describing glandular
trichomes, less attention has been paid to non-glandular
trichomes. Non-glandular trichomes are assumed to
form a physical barrier by steric hindrance of herbivores
[14,15]. Non-glandular trichomes are mainly described
for taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes [16-20] but
little is known about their production of secondary
metabolites [21].
To detect potential candidate genes for artemisinin
biosynthesis and to investigate if filamentous trichomes
produce important secondary metabolites, it is interesting
to compare filamentous and glandular trichomes. There-
fore, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis
of filamentous and glandular trichomes on the Illumina
HiSeq platform. Several cytochromes, peroxidases and
dioxygenases that are potentially involved in the bio-
synthesis of artemisinin and/or other terpenes were
upregulated in glandular trichomes. Our transcriptome
analysis confirms the established metabolic capacities of
A. annua glandular trichomes but also points to specific
metabolic activities in A. annua filamentous trichomes.
Additionally, two other transcriptome experiments were
set up to discover potential candidate genes. First, the
effect of jasmonic acid (JA) elicitation on glandular and
filamentous trichomes was investigated as e.g. Maes et al.
showed that artemisinin production can be stimulated
by JA [22].
In another experiment, the transcriptome of two cell
types from glandular trichomes was investigated to
examine in which cells the production of artemisinin,
and/or other secondary metabolites occurs. Glandular
trichomes contain morphologically distinct types of
secretory cells: white apical cells and green-coloured
sub-apical cells. In both cell types, Olofsson et al.
detected expression of genes involved in artemisinin
biosynthesis [23]. In our data set, artemisinin biosyn-
thesis genes were detected in both cell-types and no
significant conclusion could be drawn about differen-
tial expression.Methods
Overview of collected samples
In total 6 sample-types have been collected from capitula
(flower heads) of A. annua (Table 1). Three independent re-
peats of glandular (Figure 1C) and filamentous (Figure 1D)
trichomes were collected from the same mock- and JA-
treated plants. In addition to this, two repeats of separated
apical and sub-apical cells of glandular trichomes were
collected from mock-treated plants. The RNA from oneof the 2 repeats for each cell type was split in two and
separately amplified, creating 3 repeats for sequencing.
Plant preparation
Experiments were executed on Artemisia annua L. Ana-
med A3 cultivar (http://www.anamed.net). This cultivar
contains up to 1,4% artemisinin (dry weight leaves) and
is the result of cross breeding high-artemisinin producing
plants by Mediplant Inc. (Conthey, Switzerland) [24]. Ana-
med A3 can grow well in tropical regions and is not as
photosensitive as other breeds [25]. Under 8 hours day
and 16 hours night, Anamed A3 starts flowering at the
earliest after 6 months [see Additional file 1]. The length
of this pre-flowering period is in line with observations
under field conditions [26].
Seeds from A. annua Anamed were sterilized for 2 min
in 70% EtOH (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 min
in a solution with 3.84 ml NaOCl (10-13% chlorine from
Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 5 μl Tween 20 (MP
Biomedicals, Illkirch, France) and 6.16 ml sterile water.
Subsequently, seeds were rinsed with sterile water and
germinated on moist paper. After 1 or 2 weeks, shoots
were transferred to soil and grown under a regime with
8 hours day, 16 hours night and a temperature of 20°C.
After 6 months, flowers were appearing. For JA elicitation,
plants were treated for 8 days before the start of
the sampling procedure by spraying every 2 days with
a solution of 100 μM JA (Duchefa, Haarlem, The
Netherlands) containing 1.5 mM Tween20 (MP Bio-
medicals) and adding every 2 days 5 ml of 100 μM JA to
the soil. During the sampling procedure, treatment was
continued every 2 days. Control groups were treated
with a mock (water) solution in a separate room.
Glandular and filamentous sample preparation
On the basal bracts and pedicel of the capitulum, fila-
mentous trichomes are abundantly present [6]. Glandular
trichomes are protruding on the corolla of the floret
buds from the capitulum but are sunken in the capitulum
bracts and in leaves [6]. An image of a flower head
from A. annua Anamed was taken with Tabletop SEM
(TM-1000, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) [see Additional file 2].
Sunken trichomes are difficult to collect with laser cap-
ture microdissection and therefore, capitula were used to
collect glandular and filamentous trichomes. Trichomes
were collected from mock and JA-treated plants in 3
independent biological repeats. For each repeat, trichomes
were collected from a pool of 3 plants. The same plants
were used for capturing 190 glandular and 670 fila-
mentous trichomes.
On a RNA free microscope slide, a capitulum was cut
in a drop of cold buffer with 25 mM MOPSO (pH6.3)
(Sigma-Aldrich), 200 mM sorbitol (Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe,
Germany), 10 mM sucrose (Acros, Geel, Belgium), 5 mM

Overview of collected samples from A. annua. Unfixated glandular and filamentous trichomes are collected from mock- and JA-treated samples in 3 repeats (Rep).
For apical and sub-apical cells, one sample of unfixated and one sample of fixated cells are collected. The unfixated sample was amplified in 2 separate
amplifications (ampl).

5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 mM sodium-
phosphate (Acros) [23]. Trichomes were captured, using
the Palm MicroBeam system (P.A.L.M Microlaser Tech-
nologies, München, Germany) with a nitrogen UV-A laser
(wavelength 355 nm). The laser-beam was focussed on the
tissue for laser microdissection, to separate trichomes or
cells from the surrounding tissue. Free trichomes were
thereafter captured with laser pressure catapulting by
focussing the laser beam just below the tissue. Samples
were collected in 30 μl lysis buffer with ß-mercaptoethanol
(Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
An image of collected glandular and filamentous trichomes
is shown in Figure 1C and D. RNA was extracted with
the Absolutely RNA Nanoprep protocol with DNase
treatment. Samples were eluted in 10 μl and half was
used as starting material for RNA amplification.
Sample preparation of apical and sub-apical cells
Apical and sub-apical cells were collected from mock-
treated plants in the same way as described for glandular
and filamentous trichomes. In a first set of samples,
300 unfixated cells of each cell type were collected. In
a second set, 500 fixated cells of each cell-type were
collected. In this second set, the cells were fixated
before laser microdissection and catapulting to make
the separation of the cells easier. Fixation of flowers
was carried out by subjecting the samples to a 4% for-
maldehyde phosphate buffered saline solution for 3 to
4 hours in vacuum. RNA was extracted with the Abso-
lutely RNA Nanoprep protocol with DNase treatment.
The RNA from the unfixated samples was split in two
and each subsample was separately amplified to create
a third sample set for sequencing.
RNA amplification and sequencing
Samples were amplified with a linear amplification system:
the Ovation RNA-Seq System with 1 h 30 min Spia-
amplification (NuGen, AC Bemmel, The Netherlands).
In this amplification procedure, random primers andoligo dT primers are used during RNA amplification
and consequently the 5’ end of the mRNA is better
amplified compared to when only oligo dT primers are
used. The cDNA priming reaction used in the NuGEN
amplification kits are designed to avoid amplification of
rRNA sequences. After RNA amplification, barcoded
Illumina sequencing libraries were made using a post
amplification ligation-mediated strategy [27]. The 18
samples were sequenced with a read-length of 100 bp
in 3 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 flowcell.
Quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR
Nugen amplified DNA from 3 independent mock-treated
glandular and filamentous trichome samples was analyzed
with qRT-PCR. As template, 2 ng DNA was used in 10 μl
reactions containing 5 μl iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with
ROX (Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) and 400 nM primers. The
qRT-PCR experiment was performed on a Light Cycler
480 (Roche) with hotstart at 95°C for 2 min. and 42 cycles
95°C (15 sec.), 52°C (1 min.), including melting curve
analysis. Each qRT-PCR reaction was executed in duplo
and these technical repeats were averaged prior to qbase-
PLUS (version 2.3) analysis with normalization to input
DNA concentration [28]. To validate this normalization
strategy, 3 genes were included that are expected to be
similarly expressed in both trichome types: Actin 2
(homologue AT3G18780), protein phosphatase 2A subunit
A3 (PP2AA3; homologue AT1G13320) and a pentatrico-
peptide repeat (PPR) superfamily protein (homologue
AT5G55840). These genes were selected based on Arabi-
dopsis data from Czechowski et al. [29] and expression of
homologous transcripts in our RNASeq experiment.
Other transcripts analyzed were artemisinin-synthesis and
triterpene-synthesis related. Primers [see Additional file 3]
were adopted from other manuscripts [22,30] or designed
with Primer-BLAST from NCBI [31].
Trinity and Blast2GO
A de novo transcriptome was assembled from all 18
samples. Trinity Release-2011-07-13 was used to perform

the de novo assembly which was made with Trinity
Release-2011-08-20 [33]. The 150,288 Trinity contigs were
annotated using BLAST and the NCBI non-redundant
protein database. The best 5 BLAST hits were used to
indicate a putative function. The Blast2GO suite [34]
was used to generate gene ontology terms based on the
BLAST output. Two sets of settings were sequentially
used: strict and more permissive. In the more strict set-
tings, a BLAST high-scoring segment pairs (hsp) length
of 33 and a minimum hsp coverage of the query of 33
was required. The more permissive setting allowed for
a shorter BLAST hsp length of 20 with no minimum
hsp coverage of the query.
Bowtie and RSEM
Bowtie [35] and RSEM (RNASeq by Expectation Maxim-
ization) [36] were used for mapping the 289 million reads
to the Trinity de novo assembly and counting the number
of reads that matched to each contig. Standard options
were used, but RSEM’s polyA tail option was disabled.
edgeR
To perform the differential expression analysis, an R script
was developed that makes use of the Bioconductor
edgeR package [37]. All glandular and filamentous samples
were normalized together. Normalization was performed
by trimmed mean of M values (TMM). TMM equates
the overall expression levels of genes between samples
under the assumption that the majority of them are not
differentially expressed [38]. A p-value < 0.05, adjusted for
multiple testing, was used to determine which contigs
could be differentially expressed. The edgeR parameter
prior.n was set to 1.
MapMan
MapMan is a program to visualize various pathways
and to indicate genes or contigs that are up or down-
regulated [39]. Prior to MapMan, functional bins need
to be assigned to contigs of the de novo assembly. To
assign the bins, Mercator was used (default options,
Blast_cutoff: 50 and IS_DNA). Not all artemisinin bio-
synthesis genes were automatically assigned to a bin.
For those genes, additional bins were added based on the
definitions of the best 5 blast hits. The output of edgeR
was visualized with MapMan to show which metabolic
pathways are significantly differentially expressed.
Results and discussion
De novo assembly of the transcriptome
All 18 samples were sequenced in 3 lanes of an Illumina
HiSeq 2000 flowcell. For each sample, on average 16
million single-end reads of 100 bp were generated.
Around 60% of the reads had hits with a combined LSUand SSU rRNA reference database [40] and tRNA data-
base with all known tRNAs [41]. The total of 289 million
reads generated were processed using Trinity [33] to
assemble a de novo transcriptome [see Additional file 4]
containing 150,288 contigs in 108,400 homologous groups
with an average contig-length of 412 bp and a minimum
and maximum length of 201 and 7775 bp, respectively
(Table 2).
To have a better estimate of the quality of the Trinity
contigs, all 88 full-length A. annua mRNA sequences
available in the NCBI non-redundant protein database
were compared with the Trinity contigs. Of those, only 2
had no BLAST hits to the Trinity contigs. Each trinity
contig that showed a hit with one of the NCBI
sequences, covered on average 58% of the length of
the NCBI sequence. A combination of contigs with the
same BLAST-hit could together cover on average 84%
of the NCBI sequence. If the set of NCBI sequences is
assumed to be representational of the real transcripts,
one can expect that more than 80% of the length of a
random transcript is present in our assembly.
Annotation and characterization of de novo transcripts
Eighty-four% of the 150,288 contigs showed at least
one BLAST hit with the NCBI non-redundant protein
database. The first five BLAST hits served as an indication
for the putative function of a contig. The contigs were
also annotated with the Blast2GO suite [34], which links
BLAST hits to gene ontology (GO) terms: 46,711 contigs
had a good connection to GO terms, using strict settings
for Blast2GO; 5,596 contigs still had a connection to GO
terms with more permissive settings of Blast2GO; the
remaining 73,389 contigs with BLAST hits did not point
to any GO terms. As A. annua is not a model organism
and does not belong to a family of a model organism it is
logical that a lot of contigs with BLAST hits were not
annotated with GO terms. It is mostly for genes that show
strong homologies with genes of model organism that one
can expect a successful annotation using this strategy.
Moreover, a gene that performs a different function but
has a homology with a gene of a model organism, can be
annotated wrongly.
To further characterize our de novo Illumina transcripts,
they were also compared to the 454 glandular trichome
Soetaert et al. BMC Plant Biology 2013, 13:220 Page 6 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220A. annua contigs of Wang et al. [12]. Of their 42,678
contigs, 79% had a BLAST hit within our Trinity contigs.
Vice versa, only 20% of our contigs had a BLAST hit
within their contig set. This was not due to contamination
of rRNA and tRNA reads that could have resulted from
our method of mRNA amplification since only 0.6% of all
our contigs showed a hit with rRNA or tRNA. Therefore
the fact that the majority of our contigs are differential
from those of Wang et al. is most likely the result from a
greater coverage.
Influence of JA treatment
The transcriptome of mock and JA-treated trichome
samples was compared and no significant differences
(adjusted p-value < 0.05) were detected. Accordingly, at the
metabolite level, equal amounts of artemisinin, arteannuin
B, dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid were
measured with HPLC-MS/MS as shown in additional
data [see Additional file 5 and Additional file 6]. This
indicates that the JA-treatment did not have a major
influence in our experimental set-up. This was not
expected since Maes et al. measured higher artemisinin
levels after JA treatment [22]. A possible explanation is
the use of plants in different developmental stages:
Maes et al. used young seedlings while in our RNASeq
experiment 6-months old plants with closed capitula were
used. It has been shown that in flowers of Arabidopsis
thaliana, JA levels increase 6.7-fold just before flower bud
opening [42,43]. Therefore it is plausible that endogenous
JA-signalling already reached a maximum effect in our
samples and that exogenous JA treatment did not trigger
an additional response.
Glandular versus filamentous trichomes
Transcript levels from glandular trichomes and filamentous
trichomes were compared to obtain a list of significantly
differentially expressed contigs (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
To make a robust statistical comparison, 3 samples of
glandular trichomes with JA and 3 samples with mock-
treatment were compared to the 6 samples (mock and
JA) of filamentous trichomes. Of 150,288 contigs; 631
were significantly differentially expressed and all these
contigs are listed in additional data [see Additional file 7].
From these, 204 contigs were more expressed in fila-
mentous trichomes whereas, 427 contigs were more
expressed in glandular trichomes. An overview with con-
tigs discussed in this article and their normalized counts
for each sample, log2-fold changes and adjusted p-values
are shown in additional data [see Additional file 8].
MVA and MEP pathway in glandular and
filamentous trichomes
From the upregulated contigs, 5% in glandular and 0% in
filamentous trichomes were involved in the mevalonate(MVA) or 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)
pathways. The MEP and MVA pathways produce
isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl
diphosphate, which are precursors for the production
of terpenes.
MEP and MVA pathways were detected in glandular
and filamentous trichomes. All transcripts coding for
enzymes of the MEP pathway were significantly upregu-
lated in glandular trichomes (Figure 2). From the MVA
pathway, only acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (AACT)
and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase
(HMGR) were significantly upregulated in glandular tri-
chomes (Figure 2). Up-regulation of HMGR in glandular
trichomes is important since it is shown that HMGR
activity limits artemisinin biosynthesis [44,45].
Artemisinin biosynthesis in glandular and
filamentous trichomes
Terpene synthesis genes were accounting for 6% of the
upregulated contigs in glandular trichomes and only 1%
in filamentous trichomes. Starting from the MVA and
MEP pathway, farnesyl diphosphate is synthesised by
farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS) whose transcripts
were not significantly upregulated in glandular trichomes
(Figure 3 and Additional file 8). Subsequently, farnesyl
diphosphate is converted to amorpha-4,11-diene which
is the starting product for artemisinin biosynthesis. This
reaction is catalyzed by amorpha-4,11-diene synthase
(ADS) [47] and transcripts coding for this enzyme were
detected more in glandular trichomes . By CYP71AV1,
amorpha-4,11-diene is converted to artemisinic alcohol
[3,7]. Thereafter, artemisinic alcohol is oxidized by
CYP71AV1 [3,7] and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)
[10] to artemisinic aldehyde. Artemisinic aldehyde is
further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)
[8] and CYP71AV1 [3,7] to artemisinic acid or reduced
by artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) double bond reductase
(DBR2) [9] to form dihydroartemisinic aldehyde. A broad
substrate oxidoreductase (RED1) can convert dihydroarte-
misinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic alcohol [48]. This
reaction competes with ALDH1 using dihydroartemisinic
aldehyde to form dihydroartemisinic acid [8]. Dihydroarte-
misinic acid is considered to be the precursor leading
to artemisinin [9,49,50]. Transcripts corresponding to
all these enzymes involved in the conversion of amorpha-
4,11-diene to dihydroartemisinic acid were significantly
upregulated in glandular trichomes, except for RED1
(Figure 3).
These results confirm previous data pointing to glandu-
lar trichomes as the major artemisinin production site.
A short dip in chloroform causes the collapse of the
sub-cuticular space of glandular trichomes and extracts
almost all artemisinin [5,51]. In addition to this, no
artemisinin has been detected in a biotype of A. annua

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220with only filamentous trichomes [5]. Nevertheless, in all
samples of filamentous trichomes, transcripts corre-
sponding to known artemisinin biosynthesis genes were
detected, albeit at very low levels [see Additional file 8].
This is in agreement with previous reports, in which
expression of ADS was also detected by RT-PCR in fila-
mentous trichomes [12]. It should be noted though that
in contrast, no staining of filamentous trichomes was
observed in a promoter-GUS fusion study with the ADS
promoter [52].
Candidate genes for artemisinin biosynthesis
Contigs that are upregulated in glandular trichomes are
possibly linked to artemisinin biosynthesis genes. The
subset of these contigs which were annotated as cyto-
chromes, peroxidases and dioxygenases might be possible
candidates for the endoperoxide ring formation in arte-
misinin. An overview of these contigs is given in
Table 3, more results per repeat are given in additional
data [see Additional file 8].
Comp69 was detected 6 log2-fold more in glandular
compared to filamentous trichomes. The best BLAST-hit was with CYP81B1 [GenBank: CAA04117] from
Helianthus tuberosus. This enzyme is functionally charac-
terized to hydroxylate medium-chain saturated fatty
acids [53]. In addition to this, CYP81B1 can be assumed
to epoxidize these fatty acids [53,54]. In glandular trichomes,
comp548_c0_seq1 and comp548_c0_seq2 were detected
5 log2-fold more than in filamentous trichomes, these
contigs were annotated as P450 mono-oxygenase and
showed homology with predicted sequences from the
CYP82 family and CYP82C9v3 [GenBank: XP_0023
27091] from Populus trichocarpa. This CYP82 family is
relatively uncharacterized [55]. A characterized enzyme
from this family is CYP82G1 [GenBank: Q9LSF8] from
Arabidopsis thaliana which is involved in homoterpene
biosynthesis in which epoxidation might occur [56,57].
But this characterized protein was not present in the list
of best-BLAST hits with comp548. Another cytochrome
P450 significantly more expressed in glandular trichomes
was comp2774. The full length of this transcript was
determined by Misra et al. and called CIM_CYP03
(CYP72A) [GenBank: GU318227] [58]. The activity of
this enzyme was tested in vitro with artemisinic acid,

shown in red with colour scale to indicate the log2-fold change. There were no contigs with higher expression in filamentous trichomes. Grey

as substrates but no activity was detected [58]. Other
contigs significantly more expressed in glandular tri-
chomes were comp15043_c0_seq2 annotated as CYP76B1
and comp3673 as cytochrome P450. Comp586_c0_seq3
and comp586_c0_seq4 were annotated as a cytochrome
c-type. Some other cytochromes were significantly more
expressed in filamentous trichomes as shown in additional
data [see Additional file 8].
Comp252 (seq1, seq3, seq4 and seq5), 2084 and
6217_c0_seq4_1 are peroxidases detected respectively 6
log2-fold, 4 log2-fold and 30 log2-fold more in glandular
trichomes. Comp2084 was more specifically annotated
as peroxidase 49 precursor and comp6217 was annotated
as gluthatione peroxidase. In filamentous trichomes, two
contigs annotated as peroxidases were significantly more
expressed than in glandular trichomes. These contigs are
comp3274 annotated as peroxidase 1 from A. annua andcomp16324 as alkaline leaf peroxidase from Cyanara
cardunculus.
Two dioxygenases were significantly more expressed
in glandular trichomes: comp225_c0_seq1 and comp453
were both annotated as naringenin 2-oxoglutarate 3-
dioxygenase (flavanone 3-hydroxylase).
Other terpene synthases in glandular and
filamentous trichomes
Several contigs corresponding to enzymes involved in the
biosynthesis of other sesquiterpenoids were significantly
upregulated in glandular trichomes as well. These contigs
are listed in the supplementary data [see Additional file 8].
Despite a higher germacrene-A synthase expression in
glandular trichomes, germacrene-A was only detected in
biotypes without glandular trichomes [59]. This can be the
effect of up-regulation of germacrene-A oxidase which
further oxidizes germacrene-A [60].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220In filamentous trichomes, contig comp2645 correspond-
ing to 8-epi-cedrol synthase, was significantly upregulated
[see Additional file 8]. Low expression of 8-epi-cedrol
synthase in glandular trichomes has been observed by
qRT-PCR [23]. In vitro, recombinant 8-epi-cedrol synthase
converts farnesyl diphosphate to 8-epicedrol, cedrol and
minor amounts of α- cedrene and (E)-β-farnesene [61,62].
Since a higher amount of 8-epi-cedrol synthase was de-
tected in filamentous trichomes, these trichomes might
synthesize the majority of these metabolites. Differences in
(E)-β-farnesene concentration in glanded and glandless
biotypes were estimated from Tellez et al. by correlating
relative peak area to the oil content in fresh plant material
[59]. Based on these estimates, the level of (E)-β-farnesene
is approximately 1.8 times higher in glandless biotypes.
This might correlate with the upregulated expression of
8-epi-cedrol synthase in filamentous trichomes. From
α-cedrene, only trace amounts were measured in glanded
and glandless biotypes [59] and the major product cedrol
epimers were even not detected in extracts of A. annua
[61,62].
Regarding diterpenoid biosynthesis, only contigs anno-
tated as momilactone A synthase were significantly moreexpressed in glandular trichomes [see Additional file 8].
Concerning monoterpenoid biosynthesis, many monoterpe-
noid synthases were significantly upregulated in glandular
trichomes [see Additional file 8]. This is corroborated when
comparing isoprenoid contents in glanded and glandless
A. annua [59]. In oil from glanded biotypes, monoterpenes
were predominant whereas in oil from glandless biotypes
monoterpenes were almost absent.
β-amyrin synthase, an enzyme that converts 2,3-oxi-
dosqualene to the triterpene saponin β-amyrin, has been
characterized in A. annua [63]. This enzyme was repre-
sented in the de novo assembly by comp33386, comp59983,
comp96251 and comp23239 and these contigs were not
significantly differentially expressed. Contig comp7642_c0_-
seq2_1 shows homology with both dammarenediol syn-
thase and (β-)amyrin synthase and is a yet uncharacterized
oxidosqualene cyclase (U_OSC). This contig was detected
significantly more in filamentous trichomes [see Additional
file 8].
Lipid biosynthesis in glandular and filamentous trichomes
In glandular trichomes, 15% of the significantly upregulated
contigs were annotated to lipid biosynthesis. Transcripts
Soetaert et al. BMC Plant Biology 2013, 13:220 Page 10 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220and their corresponding significantly differentially ex-
pressed contigs are listed in supplementary data [see
Additional file 8]. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts
acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and was significantly up-
regulated in glandular trichomes as shown in Figure 4.
Subsequently, malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacy-
lase converts malonyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP [64]. This
transcript was not significantly upregulated. Fatty acid
biosynthesis is initiated by the condensation of malonyl-
ACP with acetyl-CoA by β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III
(KAS). β-ketoacyl-ACP is reduced by β-ketoacyl-ACP
reductase, dehydrated by β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase
and reduced by enoyl-ACP reductase to yield butyryl-
ACP. The latter transcripts except enoyl-ACP reductase
were significantly more expressed in glandular trichomes
as shown in Figure 4. The acyl-ACP end product has
two carbons more than the original acetyl molecule [64].
Similar elongation cycles are continued with condensation
of malonyl-ACP and acyl-ACP and the removal of the β-
ketogroup. Three types of KAS were present with different
acyl chain length specificities: KASIII (C2 to C4), KASI
(C4 to C16) and KASII (C16 to C18) [64]. All 3 types of
KAS were upregulated in glandular trichomes.
Further extension of C16 and C18 to longer fatty acids
requires their liberation from ACP by acyl-ACP thioes-
terase. Subsequently, fatty acids are exported out of the
plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum [64]. The extension
of fatty acids from long (C16,C18) to very long chains is
catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, β-ketoacyl-CoA
reductase, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase and enoyl-
CoA reductase [65]. The rate-limiting step and specificityFigure 4 Differentially expressed lipid biosynthesis genes in glandula

that were not significantly differentially expressed.is determined by the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase which was
significantly more expressed in glandular trichomes [see
Additional file 8].
Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (TFAR1) [22] was significantly
more expressed in glandular trichomes. The encoded
enzyme catalyzes the formation from acyl-CoA to fatty
alcohols and is potentially involved in wax formation
[22]. For the formation of unsaturated fatty acids, omega-3
fatty acid desaturase is significantly upregulated in glan-
dular trichomes. Contigs annotated as cyclopropane-
fatty-acyl phospholipid synthase were highly expressed in
glandular trichomes. This enzyme is forming a cyclopro-
pane ring in unsaturated fatty acyl chains [66,67]. Some
contigs coding for lipid transfer proteins were significantly
upregulated in glandular trichomes whereas other contigs
coding for lipid transfer proteins were upregulated in
filamentous trichomes [see Additional file 7].
The observed upregulation of lipid biosynthesis in
glandular trichomes is in agreement with the results
obtained by Tellez et al. [59], who measured that in
glanded leaves 0.24% of fresh weight is oil and in gland-
less leaves only 0.06%.
qRT-PCR
Enrichment for artemisinin-synthesis and triterpene-syn-
thesis related transcripts in glandular and filamentous
trichomes, respectively, was verified by qRT-PCR [see
Additional file 9]. In mock-treated filamentous and glan-
dular trichomes, similar expression levels were detected
for Actin2, PP2AA3 and PPR protein in both RNASeq
and qRT-PCR. Similarly, with both techniques, no clearr and filamentous trichomes. MapMan file with comparison of lipid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/220difference in FDS was observed between both trichome
types. With qRT-PCR, the mean expression levels of
CYP71AV1, DBR2, Aldh1, Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1
(TFAR1) and 10 candidate genes for artemisinin biosyn-
thesis were higher in glandular trichomes whereas the
transcripts corresponding to uncharacterized oxidos-
qualene cyclase (U_OSC) and 8-epi-cedrol synthase
were more abundant in filamentous trichomes. Hence,
this qRT-PCR experiment confirmed the RNASeq data.
Apical versus sub-apical cells
The small number of microdissected cells yielded a
suboptimal amount of RNA that could be used as input
for the Nugen SPIA amplification. For this reason, the
amplification was biased towards the high abundant
transcripts and the counts of the low abundant transcripts
showed a high variation. A comparison of apical and
sub-apical cells revealed no significantly differentially
expressed contigs (adjusted p-value < 0.05). Contigs coding
for artemisinin biosynthesis genes were detected in both
apical and sub-apical cells as shown in Figure 5, which
is in agreement with the findings of Olofsson et al. [23].
Conclusions
On the transcript level, MEP and MVA pathways were
significantly upregulated in glandular trichomes in com-
parison with filamentous trichomes. In addition to this,
transcripts coding for the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway,
other sesquiterpene biosynthesis and monoterpene path-
ways were predominantly expressed in glandular trichomes.Novel cytochrome-, peroxidase- and dioxygenases-encod-
ing genes highly expressed in glandular trichomes were
detected and these might be potential candidate genes for
the formation of the endoperoxide bridge in artemisinin.
Lipid biosynthesis pathways were highly expressed in
glandular trichomes and less in filamentous trichomes. In
filamentous trichomes, some specific genes from sesqui-
terpenoid and triterpenoid pathways such as 8-epi-cedrol
synthase and oxidosqualene cyclase were detected signifi-
cantly more than in glandular trichomes. Between the
transcriptome of apical and sub-apical cells from glandular
trichomes, no differences could be observed in the expres-
sion of artemisinin biosynthetic enzymes.
This transcriptome analysis underscores the vast meta-
bolic capacities of A. annua glandular trichomes and
simultaneously points to the existence of specific terpene
metabolic pathways in the filamentous trichomes. There-
fore, it would be interesting to examine metabolic activities
in filamentous trichomes of other plant species. Besides
this, it would also be interesting to characterize the poten-
tial candidate genes for artemisinin biosynthesis. If they
are involved in the production of artemisinin, they can
be used to produce artemisinin in yeast cells.Additional files
