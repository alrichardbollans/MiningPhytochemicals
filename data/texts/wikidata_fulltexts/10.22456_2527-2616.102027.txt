The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a fast HPLC stability-indicating method for simultaneously quantifying the 
four main isoflavones in Trifolium pratense. Validation procedures followed the ICH and FDA requirements for complex matrices. 
The stability-indicating tests were performed by exposing the isoflavones to conditions of forced degradation and further analysis 
for verifying the formation of degradation products and their possible interferences in the HPLC analysis. The major isoflavones of 
Trifolium pratense proved to be stable against acid and oxidative media, thermodegradation, and photodegradation. However, they 
proved to be unstable in alkaline media, even for short periods of exposure like 2h. In this condition, in addition to the peaks 
corresponding to isoflavones, the HPLC analysis showed the presence of three additional peaks which were eluted at different 
retention times to the reference substances, without interfering in the quantification of the four analytes of interest, formononetin, 
biochanin A, daidzein, and genistein. The method was validated following ICH and FDA guidelines showing to be specific, linear, 
precise, accurate, and robust. This first report concerning a stability-indicating method revealed that the proposed HPLC method 
reliably quantify the isoflavones and separate them from the degradation products in a short time of analysis.

Introduction 
 
Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) is a species that contains 
isoflavones, and its extracts are widely used as 
phytoestrogens, mainly due to their beneficial effects on 
climacteric symptoms. In order to expand the range of 
therapeutic applications, other effects that arouse interest 
have been investigated, such as antioxidants, anti-tumor, 
antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal. [1–5].  
Some methods have been reported to quantify the major 
isoflavones in Trifolium pratense products formononetin 
(FORMO), biochanin A (BIO), daidzein (DAID) and 
genistein (GEN) [4,6–11]. Most of these methods use high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to perform the 
isoflavones quantification taking a long time of analysis 
(most of them more than 30 min considering the carry-over 
effect). Moreover, none of these studies consider the 
possibility of interference of degradation products on the 
quantification of the analytes.  
In this context, this study aimed to develop and validate a fast 
HPLC stability-indicating method for simultaneously 
quantifying the four main isoflavones in Trifolium pratense, 
FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN. The validation was 
performed following the ICH and FDA requirements for 
complex matrices. The stability-indicating tests were carried 
out by exposing the isoflavones to conditions of forced 
degradation (stress-induced by alkaline, acid, oxidative, and 
light exposure conditions) and further HPLC analysis for 
verifying if the degradation products interfere in the assay of 
the analytes. The degradation products had their 
fragmentation patterns determined using mass spectrometry. 
To the best of our knowledge, these findings are being 
reported for the first time being original and relevant to their 
application in both food and pharmaceutical fields. 
 
 
Material and Methods 
 
Chemical and materials 
 
The isoflavones used as reference substances (standards), 
biochanin A, daidzein and genistein (≥98%, ≥95% and ≥98% 
purity, respectively) were purchased from Cayman Chemical 
Company (Ann Arbor, MI, EUA); and formononetin (≥98% 
purity) was purchased from Acros Organics (Belgium). 
Acetonitrile (HPLC grade, Tedia, Fairfield, USA), 
trifluoracetic acid (Vetec, Brazil) and water purified by a 
Milli-Q water system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) were 
used in the HPLC analysis. 
 
Apparatus and analytical conditions 
 
HPLC Analysis  
 
The development and validation of the HPLC method were 
performed on a Shimadzu HPLC-20A (Kyoto, Japan), 
consisting of an HPLC-20AT pump, a SIL-20AT auto-
sampler, and a variable wavelength (UV/vis) SPD-M20A 
detector. The data acquisition and treatment was performed 
using a Shimadzu HPLC Solution GPC software (Kyoto, 
Japan). A CLC-ODS (4.6 mm X 25 cm i.d; 5μm) shim-pack 
column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a C18 pre-
column (20 X 3.9 mm i.d; 10mm) (Waters, Milford, MA, 
USA) were employed.

The mobile phase of the proposed chromatographic method 
consisted of a phase A composed of water acidified with 0.1% 
of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and a phase B composed of 
acetonitrile. The gradient elution was 30% B (0–2 min), 30–
55% B (2–13 min), and 55–30% B (13–19 min), while the 
flow rate was a gradient of 1.0 mL/min (0–11.7 min), 1.0–0.4 
mL/min (11.7–12.2 min), 0.4 mL/min (12.2–13.8 min), 0.4–
1.0 mL/min (13.8–14.2 min), and 1.0 mL/min (14.2-19 min). 
The column was re-equilibrated with 30% phase B for two 
minutes before the next analysis was initiated. The injection 
volume was 10 μL, the analysis temperature was 40°C, and 
the UV detector was set at wavelength 260 nm. 
 
Mass Spectrometry (MS) 
  
Isoflavone aglycones stability-indicating studies were 
performed using an I-Class ACQUITY ultra-performance 
liquid chromatography (UPLC™, Waters, USA) system 
(Waters, USA) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight 
analyzer (QTOF) (SYNAPT G2 Si, Waters, USA). The 
UPLC analysis parameters were based on the HPLC 
analytical conditions, with modifications. An Acquity UPLC 
HSS T3 column (2.1 × 10 mm i.d., 1.8 μm) (Waters, USA) 
was used. The mobile phase was a formic acid solution 0.1% 
(v/v) (A), and acetonitrile with formic acid 0.1% (v/v) (B) 
following a gradient elution program: 0–1 min, 30% B; 1–8 
min, from 30% to 60% B; 8–9.5 min, 60% B; 9.5–9.6 min, 
from 60% B to 30% B; 12 min, stop time. The flow rate was 
0.4 mL/min, the injection volume was 0.6 µL and the column 
temperature was 40°C. A leucine-encephalin solution (1 
µg/mL; acetonitrile:water (50:50, v/v) with formic acid 0.1% 
(v/v)) was employed as a lock mass solution (554.2615 m/z 
in ESI- and 556.2771 m/z in ESI+). The data were processed 
with Mass Lynx 4.1 and Mass fragment 3.0 software (Waters, 
USA). The analysis was performed in ESI- and ESI+ MSE 
centroid mode, in TOF mode (Resolving power 20,000). The 
source conditions were: 2 kV of capillarity; 120°C and 550°C 
source and desolvation temperatures, respectively; 30 V and 
80 V for the sampling cone and source offset, respectively; 
50 L/h and 900 L/h of cone and desolvation gases flow, 
respectively; and 6.5 bar of spray gas flow. Nitrogen was used 
as a desolvation gas, cone gas, and nebulizer gas. The argon 
was employed as collision gas at transfer (40 eV) collision 
cells. A 50–1000 m/z mass range was monitored with a scan 
time of 0.2 s and an interscan delay of 0.015 s. 
 
Solutions 
 
Stock and reference solutions 
 
Stock isoflavone solutions (80 µg/mL) FOR, BIO, DAID, and 
GEN were prepared in acetonitrile by weighing 
approximately 8 mg of each component into 100 mL 
calibrated volumetric flasks. Reference solutions were 
prepared by dilutions of the stock solution with an aqueous 
solution of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. 
 
Trifolium pratense extract (matrix) 
 
Trifolium pratense extract was previously obtained by 
maceration in 40% ethanol at 25°C for 7 days (1:15 w/v). A 
suitable aliquot (1:5 v/v) was diluted in an aqueous solution 
of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, filtered through a 0.45 µm 
membrane and analyzed. 
 
 
Validation of the analytical method 
 
The developed method was validated according to the official 
validation guidelines [12,13] in a range of 0.5–20 μg/mL for 
FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN. The results were analyzed 
by Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using 
a level of significance of α=0.05. The interference of 
degradation products formed in the stability-indicating tests 
on the Trifolium pratense major isoflavones assay was also 
evaluated in the validation. 
 
Assessment of the matrix effect 
 
The matrix effect evaluation was performed as described by 
Watanabe et al. [14] and Yatsu et al. [15] by comparing the 
slopes of calibration curves of the isoflavone aglycone 
standards (FOR, BIO, DAID, and GEN) in the solvent and the 
matrix. 
Three analytical curves were obtained on three consecutive 
days by plotting the peak areas versus the concentration of 
isoflavone aglycone standards (0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 
and 20.0 µg/mL) in acetonitrile 50% (v/v) and the matrix 
solution. Each concentration level was analyzed in five 
replicates. 
The matrix effect was calculated according to the following 
equation: 𝑀𝐸% = 100 𝑥 [1 − (𝑆𝑚/𝑆𝑠)], where 𝑆𝑚 
corresponds to the slope of the standard curves of the 
isoflavone standards in the mobile phase and 𝑆𝑠 is the slopes 
of the standard curves of the isoflavone standards in the 
matrix. 
 
Specificity and stability-indicating tests 
 
The specificity of the HPLC method was evaluated by 
injecting samples containing only the matrix (Trifolium 
pratense extract) and samples containing the matrix added of 
isoflavone aglycones standard quantities of FORMO, BIO, 
DAID, and GEN in concentrations of 4 μg/mL each one. The 
aglycone isoflavones present in the matrix were identified 
based on their UV spectra, between 200 and 400 nm, and their 
retention times compared to the reference substances. 
For testing the specificity against cyclodextrins, an amount of 
approximately 1 mg of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin 
(HPβCD) and beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) was dissolved with an 
aqueous solution of acetonitrile (50% v/v) in 25 ml 
volumetric flasks. These samples were placed in an 
ultrasound bath for 30 minutes, filtered in 0.45 µm membrane 
and injected in HPLC equipment. 
The specificity of the HPLC method against the degradation 
of products from stability-indicating tests was also evaluated. 
The stock solutions of standards were also submitted to the 
forced degradation conditions shown in Table 1. 
All samples were compared to a control solution of the 
analytes (FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN) at a concentration 
of 16 µg/mL (diluted in an aqueous solution of acetonitrile 
50% v/v), protected from light. The analysis was carried out 
in triplicate, and the purity of the peak was determined using

a PDA detector. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed 
for the degradation products after forced degradation.

Linearity, precision and accuracy 
 
The linearity of the method was evaluated by regression 
analysis using the least square method. Three calibration 
curves were obtained by performing dilutions from the 
reference isoflavone stock solution on three consecutive days. 
The plot of the peak area versus the reference aglycone 
isoflavone concentration, diluted in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 
was performed. The linearity of the method was given in the 
following concentrations: 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0 and 
20.0 μg/mL for the reference aglycones and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 
6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 μg/mL in matrices. For each level of 
concentration, samples were taken in six replicates. The limits 
of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method 
were calculated based on the standard deviation of the 
intercept and slope of the reference curves. 
The intra-day precision, which evaluates the repeatability of 
the results, was determined in three concentration levels: low, 
medium, and high (1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 μg/mL, respectively) in 
the presence of the matrix. Six analyses were performed for 
each concentration within the same day and under the same 
experimental conditions. The intermediate precision (inter-
day precision) was obtained by calculating the same 
concentration levels on three different days. The standard 
deviation and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were 
calculated for each of these levels. To assess the accuracy of 
the method, isoflavone aglycone standard was added at three 
different amounts/levels (1.0, 4.0 and 8.0 µg/mL) to the 
matrix. For each concentration level, six replicates were 
performed and quantified. Accuracy was determined 
mathematically through the equation: 
 
𝑅𝐸% =
𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 − 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
(𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)𝑥100
 
 
System suitability 
 
The suitability test of the analytical system was performed to 
determine whether the method was suitable for the proposed 
analysis. The parameters evaluated were the retention time, 
peak area, plates, tailing factor, and resolution between the 
FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN peaks. Each parameter was 
analyzed in six replicates. 
 
Robustness 
 
Robustness was assessed according to the Plackett-Burmann 
design method, as described by Vander Heyden et al [16]. The 
factors analyzed for the matrix, which were modified to low 
(-1) and high (+1) levels, were: furnace temperature of the 
column (39; 41°C), acetonitrile concentration in the mobile 
phase (29; 31%), initial flow rate (0.9; 1.1 mL/min) and TFA 
concentration (0.08; 0.12%). The variation of these four 
factors were combined in eight experiments and the responses 
evaluated were the percentages of aglycone isoflavones 
(FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN) in the matrix compared to 
the standard solutions. The effect of each parameter was 
calculated by summing the responses of the low and high 
levels, allowing the statistical interpretation (tcalculated > tcritical) 
of the similarity or difference of the results. There was no 
need for further testing since all isoflavone standard 
aglycones and matrixes were maintained under the same 
experimental conditions. A plot of semi-normal probability 
was also plotted to estimate the experimental error and 
significant effects from the effects in combination with the 
dummy factors. 
 
Stability of the aglycones in the matrix 
 
The stability of the isoflavones in the matrix added with 
known amounts of isoflavone standards was determined after 
48 h of storage at room temperature. The stability of these 
solutions was assessed by analyzing any change in the 
chromatographic profile compared to freshly prepared 
solutions. 
 
Method application 
 
The determination of FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN in a 
Trifolium pratense extract (TPE) was performed as described 
in the section matrix solution. Brief, an isoflavone-enriched 
fraction (IEF) was obtained by evaporation of a Trifolium 
pratense macerate, resulting in a dry fraction. This dry 
fraction was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile:water (1:1) 
to obtain 0.01 % w/v solution. This solution was filtered 
through 0.45 µm membrane (PTFE) and analyzed by HPLC. 
The determination of the aglycone isoflavones was further 
evaluated in a complex of the Trifolium pratense extract with 
β-cyclodextrin (TPE:βCD). Spray drying method was 
employed for complexation, adding βCD (40% w/w) to the 
extract of Trifolium pratense (matrix). Approximately 1 mg 
of this spray-dried powder was dissolved in a mixture of 
acetonitrile:water (1:1) to obtain a 0.01% w/v solution. The 
solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane (PTFE) 
and analyzed by HPLC. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Many efforts for quantifying the isoflavones in Trifolium 
pratense raw material or derivatives products have been made 
in the last years generating several reports on HPLC 
analytical methods [7,8,10,11,17]. Despite that, some 
limitations remain. One of these is a long time of the analysis 
 
Drug Anal. Res., v. 4, n. 1, p. 29-39, 2020 
 
32 
(> 30 min) and the consequent high solvent consuming 
[7,8,10,11,17]. Another limitation is the occurrence of the 
matrix effect, which requires prior purification steps of the 
sample. However, what is especially striking is that no 
method alludes to the possibility of interference by 
degradation products in the quantification of the analytes, 
FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN. 
In this work, a new HPLC chromatographic method is 
proposed, which is faster than the methods previously 
reported, to determine the matrix effect and to identify and 
separate the Trifolium pratense aglycone isoflavones from the 
degradation products that are formed by degradation in the 
forced stability tests. 
 
HPLC method development and advantages 
 
The previous HPLC analytical methods are focused on 
separating the major isoflavones to quantifying them in 
different Trifolium pratense extracts [6–8,10,11,17]. 
However, these methods still require better performance such 
as lower elution time and the selectivity against the presence 
of products from forced degradation. Thus, in the present 
work, the method reported by Ramos et al. [7] was applied in 
order to separate the peak corresponding to the product 
formed in the alkaline degradation (NaOH 1M, 2h) from that 
corresponding to BIO. However, the peak corresponding to 
the degradation product showed similar retention time as 
FORMO and the HPLC-PDA analysis demonstrated that their 
UV spectra (PDA) were different (Fig. 1). This results 
demonstrated that the alkaline degradation of BIO produces a 
degradation product that interferes with the FORMO 
quantification, revealing the need to change the conditions of 
the HPLC analysis for separating them.  
Thus, the stability-indicating method performed in the present 
work revealed the need to separate FORMO from the 
degradation product named DB for the reliable quantitation 
of FORMO; several chromatographic conditions were then 
tested. The best separation system for the analytes was 
achieved with a gradient method using acetonitrile (30% v/v) 
and acidified water (0.1% v/v TFA), which improved the 
symmetry of the peaks. To improve the resolution among the 
peaks, it was necessary to use a flow gradient at the retention 
time where their separation was critical (11.7–14.2 min). The 
UV detection was set at 260 nm since all the aglycones 
isoflavones of interest have good absorption at this 
wavelength [18]. 
Figure 2 shows a representative chromatogram of the 
Trifolium pratense extract added with the alkaline 
degradation product of BIO. Adequate separation of the peaks 
of all the analytes of interest (FORMO, BIO, DAID, and 
GEN) can be observed, as well the presence of the other peaks 
from the plant material and in relation to the BIO degradation 
peak (Table 2). 
The total time of analysis of the proposed method was 
determined as being the eluate time plus the time necessary 
for cleaning the column before the next run. The method 
show 21 min of analysis time, which is shorter than the time 
analysis of more than 40 min. reported by most of the 
methods (8, 10, 11 and 17). The carry-over effect was 
evaluated by analyzing white samples after the injection of 
samples with high concentrations of the analytes, and any 
peak in the chromatogram was observed. The method here 
proposed was characterized by absence of carry-over effect 
becomes the method here reported advantageous on the 
method reported by Ramos et al. [7], which present a run time 
of 18 minutes, but requires additional 18 minutes for cleaning 
the column and rebalance the system at each analysis end.

Validation of the HPLC method 
 
Assessment of the matrix effect 
 
When the analyte is incorporated into a complex matrix 
compared to a standard or reference solution, the matrix effect 
on the analyte quantification is a critical parameter that 
should be evaluated during the validation of an analytical 
method. This effect can result in suppression or enhancement 
of the response, which may impair the correct quantification 
of analytes [15]. The results for the matrix effect (ME% 
<2.24) for each aglycone isoflavone are shown in Table 3. 
These data indicate that the samples show a low matrix effect 
(ME%) for the determination of isoflavones when analyzed 
according to as recommended by Niessen et al. [19] (low 
matrix effect for a range between -20% < C% < 20%). 
 
Specificity 
 
The chromatographic separation (HPLC) of isoflavone 
aglycones (standards) at 260 nm showed retention times of 
7.49, 10.42, 14.13 and 17.49 min for DAID, GEN, FORMO, 
and BIO, respectively (Fig. 3A). The λmax spectra 
corresponding to each peak are shown in figure 3B (HPLC-
DAD); the mass spectrum with the characteristic molecular 
ions is shown in Figure 3C, which is consistent with those 
already reported for this type of molecules [8,15,18].

To evaluate the specificity of the HPLC method, samples of 
Trifolium pratense extract and cyclodextrins were injected in 
the equipment and the purity of the peaks was checked. 
Figure 4a shows that all isoflavone peaks exhibit high purity 
(Fig. 4a) demonstrating the absence on interferences of the 
other extract matrix constituents as well as the of the tested 
cyclodextrins (which did not show any signal in the 
chromatogram). A sample of the cyclodextrin-extract spray-
dried powder was also evaluated, and the purity of all the 
analytes was verified, denoting that there was no interference 
on the four isoflavones quantification. 
These data represent critical information for developing of 
analytical methods as part of a validation protocol and 
produce valuable information for investigation of degradation 
products. A well planned and executed forced degradation 
study provides a representative sample for developing a 
stability-indicating HPLC method [20].

However, there is no consensus as to how much stress is 
required to undertake this type of study. Some pharmaceutical 
scientists suggest degradations between 5 and 20% as being 
reasonable for the validation of chromatographic assays [20–
22]. It is also not necessary for forced degradation to result in 
a degradation product, but in this study, we performed a 
screening at different levels of stress (variation of exposure 
time and variation in the concentration of degrading agent) in 
an attempt to detect the possible degradation product 
formation of both at low and slightly higher levels of stress. 
Even in the most extreme conditions tested, all the aglycone 
isoflavones (FORMO, BIO, DAID, and GEN) presented a 
degradation percentage below 20% (RSD <3.7%) for thermal, 
acid and oxidative degradation. On the other hand, in the 
condition of photolysis, FORMO presented degradation 
higher than 30% (RSD 4.5%) for both times of exposure (24h, 
48h). The forced degradation study revealed that the tested 
isoflavones gradually degraded in alkaline medium, showing 
significant variation after 2h of stress. After 24h of exposure 
to the alkaline medium, degradation of 98.01% of FORMO 
(RSD 3.6%), 93.19% of BIO (RSD 3.6%), 79.97% of DAID 
(RSD 3.00%), and 66.33% GEN (RSD 1.9%). 
However, only three new peaks corresponding to the 
degradation products of FORMO, BIO, and DAID could be 
observed in the HPLC method (Fig 4B), D1, D2, and D3 
which showed retention times of 16.2, 13.5 and 9.4 min, 
respectively. All degradation products showed good 
separation from the other peaks of the reference substances 
and even of the matrix, resulting in a very good resolution 
(>2.0). The maximum UV spectra of the principal degraded 
peaks showed λmax: 245/281 nm for D1, λmax: 245/286 nm 
for D2 and λmax: 281/304 nm for D3.  
The stability tests associated with the UPLC-QTOF/HDMS 
analysis is a new and relevant tool for determining the 
fragmentation pattern and the chemical structures of the main 
degradation products. Thus, to increase knowledge of the 
identity of degradation products of FORMO, BIO, DAID and 
GEN and to confirm the purity of the aglycone isoflavones, 
they were analyzed by mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-QTOF/HDMS), after stress. In this system, the 
retention times of the peaks were 4.54 (FORMO), 6.21 (BIO), 
2.16 (DAID) and 3.37 min (GEN) for the reference 
isoflavones and 5.6, 4.5 and 2.9 min for the degradation 
products D1, D2, and D3, respectively. We obtained for D1 
the precursor [M-H] - the ion m/z 257 and as products the ions 
224 and 109 m/z, which have similarities to those described 
by Yatsu et al. in 2014 [15] for O-desmethylangolensin.  
The proposed molecular formula and the corresponding 
fragmentation ions are shown in Table 4 for the three alkaline 
degradation products (1M NaOH). However, more studies are 
necessary to enlighten their chemical structure. 
 
Linearity, precision and accuracy 
 
The linearity of the response between the peak areas and 
isoflavone concentrations is presented in Table 3. It was 
obtained through reference analytical curves determined in 
three different days, demonstrating good linearity through the 
analysis of determination coefficients (>0.999) for all 
compounds within the tested range. The graphic analysis of 
the residuals and the confidence interval observed in the t-test 
in the intercepts reveal the absence of constant systematic 
error. The ANOVA test for regression residue analysis did not 
show any deviation in the linearity in the analyzed 
concentration range, and there was no significant variation 
between the curves on different days (p>0.05). The results of 
LOD and LOQ (table 3) show that the method presents good 
sensitivity for the analyzed standards. 
The precision of the method was assessed by determining the 
repeatability and intermediate precision of the isoflavone 
aglycone reference in the matrix. Even being a complex 
matrix, the results (RSD <5%) demonstrate that the method 
is precise. Intra-day precision data showed a relative standard 
deviation (RSD) value of 0.47–4.58% for the lowest 
concentration level, between 0.33–2.38% for the average 
level and between 0.33–2.17% for the highest level. The 
inter-day precision data had an RSD value between 1.58–
3.79% for the lowest-level tests, between 0.53–1.95% for the 
medium level and between 0.68–1.63% for the highest level 
of concentration. 
The accuracy of the method was determined using a recovery 
test. The recovery results were 97.03–104.04% for the low 
level, 98.84–100.17% for the mean level, and 99.14–
100.35%, which is considered adequate according to the 
validation guidelines.

Plackett-Burman experimental design and their t-critical, represented by the vertical line, for each isoflavone in the matrix (Trifolium 
pratense extract). 
 
 
Robustness 
 
Robustness is critical to assess if the analytical method 
developed can remain unaffected to small, deliberate 
variations in the method parameters and consequently ensures 
that the method is reliable during routine use of analyses 
[12,23]. The Plackett-Burman screening design was used as 
statistical tool for robustness assessment since several factors 
can be analyzed simultaneously with a reduced number of 
experiments [24]. 
From the experimental design, the percentage of FORMO, 
BIO, DAID, and GEN in the samples was calculated in 
relation to the reference solutions for each experiment. The 
results show that there was no difference of significance for 
all the analyses (Fig. 5), where the calculated t values were 
lower than the critical t (α = 0.05). Therefore, the deliberate 
variations in the experimental conditions did not interfere 
with the percentage of aglycone isoflavones, demonstrating 
the robustness of the proposed analytical method. 
 
System suitability 
 
Routine analysis of the reference substances was performed 
under the developed experimental conditions and the 
following values and their variability (RSD %) for each 
compound were evaluated: (I) DAID analysis: 7.49 (0.08) 
min for migration time, 6943.63 (1.21) for plates, and 0.998 
(1.15) for tailing factor; (II) GEN analysis: 10.42 (0.03) min 
for migration time, plates 12104.80 (1.61), and tailing factor 
0.962 (0.95); (III) FORMO analysis: 14.13 (0.04) min for 
migration time, 12516.68 (4.23) for plates, and 0.730 (0.42) 
for tailing factor; (IV) BIO analysis: 17.49 (0.05) min for 
migration time, 33186.34 (1.72) for plates, and 0.948 (0.57) 
for the tailing factor. The resolution between DAID and GEN 
peaks was 7.92 (0.64), GEN and FORMO peaks was 8.39 
(1.49) and 7.55 (1.10) between FORMO and BIO. The 
parameters indicate that the system is suitable for the analysis. 
 
Stability of the aglycones isoflavones in the matrix 
 
In the study evaluating the stability of the isoflavones in the 
matrix, they demonstrated no need to change their 
concentration in the matrix after 48h storage at room 
temperature (RSD <5.0%). 
The variation in the values of the isoflavones concentration in 
the matrix, after this period, were found to be between 99.25 
and 103.91% (RSD 1.94%) for FORMO, 99.68 to 103.16% 
(RSD 1.63%) for BIO, between 98.31 to 103.46% (RSD 
2.32%) for DAID and between 98.24 to 104.77% (RSD 
2.68%) for GEN. 
 
Method applications 
 
For verifying the applicability of the method, samples of 
products derived from Trifolium pratense were tested. The 
content of isoflavone aglycones present in Trifolium pratense 
extract (TPE), an isoflavone-enriched fraction (IEF), and an 
extract of Trifolium pratense associated to βCD (TPE:βCD) 
was determined. The results (Table 5) indicate the accuracy 
of the method in all samples, where the RSD was less than 
3.26% in the test for TPE, 3.21% for IEF and 4.24 for TPE: 
βCD.

Conclusions 
 
This is the first report on a validated stability-indicating 
HPLC method capable of quantifying the four isoflavones 
from Trifolium pratense, formononetin, biochanin A, 
genistein, and daidzein. The method is fast and selective 
against the other extract constituents, and the degradation 
products generated in alkaline forced conditions. The method 
showed robustness, low matrix effect, linearity, precision, 
and accuracy. The UPLC-QTOF/HDMS fragmentation 
pattern and a molecular formula of three degradation products 
from forced degradation were determined.  In summary, the 
proposed stability-indicating HPLC validated method allows 
the simultaneous quantification of the four isoflavones of 
Trifolium pratense in a fast and reliable way, which is useful 
for application in food or pharmaceutical fields.
