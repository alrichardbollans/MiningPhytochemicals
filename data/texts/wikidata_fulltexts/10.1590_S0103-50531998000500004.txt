Introduction
Himatanthus articulata (Vahl) Woodson, (Apocy-
naceae) is a tree occurring in the Amazon region. The local
population uses its bark and latex as a tonic and as a
antisyphilitic1. Species belonging to the genus Himatan-
thus have been scarcely mentioned in the chemical litera-
ture. Earlier studies of Himatanthus articulata recorded the
isolation of the acetate and cinnamate of a-amyrin and of
b-amyrin2-4. From H. phageadaenica were isolated and
identified an acetylated mixture of the triterpenes a-amyrin
and lupeol, in addition to sitosterol and the iridoid lactones:
plumericin, allamandin and isoplumericin, as well as a
mixture of plumieride glucoside and sucrose5. A glyco-
sylplumieride has been also isolated from H. lancifolius6,7,
formerly known as Plumeria lancifolia8.
Results and Discussion
Latex of Himatanthus articulata collected near Ma-
capá-AP, Brazil, was extracted with hexane and methanol.
The hexane extract yielded, after several chromatograpic
steps, a mixture of the cinnamate of a-amyrin and b-amyrin
(6 and 7) along with the acetate of lupeol (4), cinnamate of
lupeol (5) and cycloartenol (3). Leaves and bark of this
plant were extracted successively with hexane and metha-
nol. The methanolic extract of leaves consisted almost
exclusively of ursolic acid (90%, 8). The hexane extract of
bark yielded, besides the terpenoids 4 and 5, stigmasterol
(9) and sitosterol (10). The methanolic extract of bark
yielded the spirolactone iridoids (1 and 2), plumericin (12),
isoplumericin (13) and methylmyoinositol (11). Com-
pounds 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 have been isolated for the
first time from the genus Himatanthus.
The fractions obtained by chromatographic fractiona-
tion of the acetylated methanolic extract yielded the iridoid
derivatives 1a and 2a. The 13C-NMR (HBBD and DEPT)
spectra of 1a showed five signals for dCH and one dCH2 of
the sugar unit. Seven dH signals in the 1H-NMR spectrum
have been assigned to the same sugar moiety by the ho-

monuclear 1H, 1H-COSY and also by comparison with
literature data5,9. The peaks at m/z 332 (2.0%, 1f) and 33l
(20.0%, 1g) observed in the EIMS spectra are compatible
with the 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl
group. The cross peaks observed in the 2D 1H, 13C-COSY-
1JCH allowed to correlation of the signals at dH l.48 (d,
6.6 Hz), 5.60 (q, 6,6 Hz), 5.10 (br) in the 1H-NMR spec-
trum, respectively, with a methyl group and two hydrogen
atoms attached to oxygenated carbons that are connected
with carbons at dC 19.40, 66.18 and 93.33 ppm. The same
spectrum showed four proton signals at 5.38 (br, 6.8 Hz),
6.96 (br), 6.43 (m) and 7.41 (br) connected to the sp2
carbons at dC 144,50, 128,66, 148,50 and 151,75 ppm.
Comparison of these data and the remaining 1H and 13C
chemical shift of the acetyl derivative 1a (see Experimen-
tal) with those reported for plumeride5,10 allowed to iden-
tification of the aglycone of 1. Peaks in the EIMS spectrum
corresponding to fragments 1b-1e are in agreement with
the structure of 1. To establish the b-D-glucopyranosyl
moiety at the b-position of the carbon C-l, the dC-1 (93,33
ppm) and dH-1 (5, 10; br) were compared with the models
1b-O-acetyl (2b)9 and 1b-O-glucopyranosyl (2c)9, and
with those of the penta-O-acetylplumeride glucoside (2a),
previously isolated from H. phageadaenica.5 The presence
of a carboxylic acid group in 1 was confirmed by the signals
at dH 3.93(s), dC 51.50(CH3) and 170.50 (C) in the 1H- and
13C-NMR spectra of the methyl ester obtained after treat-
ment of la with diazomethane.
The structures of plumeride glucoside (2), plumericin
(12) and isoplumericin (13) were determined by analysis
of 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra and comparison with litera-
ture data5,11. These iridoids have been commonly reported
in the Plumeria genus10,11.
Identification of compounds 3-10 was achieved by
analysis of IR, NMR and EIMS spectra and comparison
with literature data. The 1H-NMR spectra allowed the
identification of the respective series of 3 (cycloartene), 4-8
(pentacyclic triterpenes) and 9-10 (steroids). Analysis of
13C-NMR data and the use of the Olea et al12 methodology
led to the confirmation of the triterpene series as cy-
cloartene (3)13, lupene (4, 5), ursene (6, 8) and oleanene
(7).14-16 The main peaks observed in the mass spectra are
compatible with those fragment ions expected for triter-
pene units.
The acetate unit in 4 was identified by the dC = O (171.30
ppm) and dCH3 (21.30 ppm) in the 13C-NMR spectrum as
well as the dH (2.05 ppm) in the 1H-NMR spectrum.
The trans cinnamate units of 5-7 were identified by
analysis of IR data, showing signals at 1725 cm-1 (nC=O,
conjugated ester), 1600, 1500 cm-1 (nC=C, aromatic) and
nC-O at 1250 cm-1. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed two
doublets at dH 7.60-7.68 (16.0 Hz, H-a) and 6.45-6.48 (16.0
Hz, H-b) and two signals for five aromatic protons [7.59
(m; H-2’,6’) and 7.37 (m; H-3’,4’,5’)]. 13C-NMR spectrum
showed dC 166,20-166,80 (C=O), 134,50-134,70 (C-1’),
dCH:129.00-129.20; 128.00-128.40; 130.00-130.50 (C-2’-
6’) and 118.30-118.70 ppm (C-a) which are similar to those
found in the literature16.
The chemical shifts of H-3 [dH 4.45 (dd, J = 10,0 and
4,0 Hz)] in 4 and 5 and [dH 4.72 (dd, 11,0 and 7,0 Hz)] in
6 and 7 as well as the carbon chemical shifts of C-3 [dC
80.90 (4, 5, 6 and 7)], C-2 [dC 23.70 (4 and 5), 23.50 (6),
23.70 (7)] and C-4 [dC 37.70 (4, 5), 37.60 (6, 7)] were
compared with those of 3b-O-acetyl and 3b-O-cinnamoyl
triterpene derivatives in the literature15,16 to establish the
b-position of O-acetyl and O-cinnamoyl moieties at C-3. A
literature search revealed the absence of NMR spectral data
for 1a and 13C-NMR data for 5 and 614,17. Therefore, these
assignments are described in the experimental part.
The structure of compound 8 was established as follow-
ing: the IR signals at 3450 cm-1 (nO-H), 1620 cm-1 (nC=C)
and 1080 cm-1 (nC-O, secondary alcohol), the 1H-NMR
spectrum showed signals at dH 5,25 (m, H-12), 3,15 (m,
H-3), 2,2 (d, 14.0 Hz, H-18) and signals relative to seven
methyl groups at dH 0.75, 0.84, 0.96, 0.96, 1,11(s); 0.89 and
0.95 (d, 6.0 Hz). These data are in agreement with a
pentacyclic acid triterpene of the ursane seires. The peaks
at m/z 456 (M+, 11%), 207 (47%), 208 (11%), 248 (100%),
189 (17%) observed in the mass spectrum, along with
analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra of the acetyl derivative
8a and comparison with those of the literature18-20, allowed
identification of the structure of the known triterpene 8. The
derivatives 8b and 8c showed dC: 171.0, 21.08 (H3CCO),
51.41 (H3C-O) in the 13C-NMR spectrum and dH 2,04 (s,
H3CCO), 3,60 (s, H3C-O) in the 1H-NMR spectrum which
were used to confirm the structure of 8 as urs-3b-hydroxy-
12-en-28-oic acid (ursolic acid).
The mixture of sterols 9 and 10 was identified by the
signals at dH 0.62 (s), 1.05 (s), 0.74-0.98 (m) in the 1H-NMR
spectrum corresponding to the absorptions of the methyl
groups, the dH 3.49 (H-3), besides the signals at dH 5.10 (m,
H-22 and H-23, 9), dH 5.50 (d br, H-6, 9 and 10) of the
olefinic protons. These data along with the 13C-NMR and
EIMS spectral analysis of that mixture, and comparison
with literature data21, led us to identify 9 as stigmasterol
and 10 as sitosterol.
The structure of the carbohydrate was established as
methylmioinositol (11) by comparative analysis of chemi-
cal shifts of the monoprotoned carbon atoms observed in
the 13C-NMR (HBBD and DEPT) spectra with values
described in the literature22. The spectral analysis of the
derivative 11a including 1H-NMR, 1D and 2D (1H,1H-
COSY) and 1H,13C-COSY, nJCH, n = 1, 2 and 3) confirmed
structure 1123.

versidade de São Paulo and with the Micro Mass-12 of the
NPPN-Laboratório de Tecnologia Farmacêutica-Universi-
dade Federal da Paraiba. Infrared spectra were recorded as
KBr discs on a Perkin Elmer 1420 spectrophotometer.
Column chromatography was run using silica gel S (Riedel
0.032-0.063 nm) for separation by gravity and with Merck
230/400 Mesh 60A for flash column chromatography. TLC
analysis was done with silica gel G (Merck or Aldrich) and
the spots were visualized by UV (254 nm) irradiation,
reaction with an alcoholic solution of phosphomolybdic
acid followed by heat, or by exposure to iodine vapor.
Liquid-liquid partition chromatography was performed us-
ing the CCC Ito apparatus with a coil #10 (2.60 mm,
400 mL vol. approx., PTFE tubing). The preparative cen-
trifugal chromatography was run with a Chromatotron
from Harrison Research.
Plant material
Bark, leaves and latex of H. articulata (Vahl) Woodson
were collected by botanist Benedito Vitor Rabello in
Amapá state, Brazil. Authentication was performed by
comparing it with a voucher specimen (No 0522) preserved
at the Herbário Amapaense (HAMAB) of the IEPA, Ma-
capá - AP, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation
The pulverized air-dried bark material (1.7 kg) and
leaves (1.4 kg) were extracted by maceration at room
temperature successively with hexane and methanol. The
solvents were removed under vacuum to yield 10.8 g of
hexanic extract and 30.0 g of methanolic extract from the
bark and 73.6 g of hexanic extract and 50.0 g of methanolic
extract from the leaves. The latex dissolved in CHCl3 was
filtered under vacuum and removal of the solvent gave
21.5 g of extract. The residue (5.0 g) of the latex was
chromatographed on a nylon dried column of silica gel and
eluted with CH2Cl2 and 15 fractions were collected. These
fractions were analysed by TLC and submitted to centrifu-
gal preparative chromatography (Chromatotron) with hex-
ane/dichloromethane as eluents. From the fractions 1-4 was
isolated the mixture of 6 and 7 (m.p.: 85-90°, 70.0 mg);
fractions 5-15 were fractioned by flash chromatography on
a silica gel column to yield 3 (m.p.: 167-169°, 170.0 mg),
9 and 10 (m.p.: 130-132°, 172.0 mg). and a mixture of these
compounds along with aliphatic acids. The hexanic extract
from bark (5.0 g) was fractioned on silica gel column using
CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate as eluents in increasing polarities and
80 fractions were collected. Removal of the solvent give 5
(amorphous material, 60.0 mg) and 4 and 5 (100.0 mg)
along with a mixture of these compounds and a mixture of
aliphatic acids. The methanolic extract (30.0 g) from bark
was submitted to acid-base extraction. The solution was
concentrated and lyophylised to yield the HABM fraction
which was dried in an Abderhalden apparatus. IR analysis
of the fraction confirmed the absence of an ester carbonyl.
The HABM was acetylated with acetic anhydride and
pyridine to obtain HABM-Ac. Part of this product (4.0 g)
was fractionated in a column of silica gel using chloroform
as eluent yielding 17 fractions. Hexane was added to the
these fractions yielding a solid 11a (MP: 215-217°, 45 mg)
and a solution with a mixture of iridoids, carbohydrates and
other compounds. This mixture was partitionated by CCC
(Ito) with CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (35:40:25) using CHCl3 as
the mobile phase. Aliphatic acids were found in the mobile
phase. The remaining phase was fractionated by prepara-
tive centrifugal chromatography (Chromatotron) using
hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol in increasing polarities to
yield 11a (370 mg), 1a (amorphous material, 40 mg) and
2a (amorphous material, 15 mg). NMR spectrum and TLC
analysis of the hexanic extract from leaves revealed the
presence of the same compounds found in the hexanic
extract from bark. The portion of methanolic extract that
was soluble in methanol gave 8 (m.p.: 226-228°, 25.0 g)
after addition of ethyl acetate.
Acetylation of the fraction HABM and 8
The fraction HABM (Himatanthus articulata Bark
Methanol) and 8 were, separately, dissolved in a mixture
of pyridine and Ac2O (1:1) and the solution was allowed to
stand for 24 h at room temperature. The usual work up
yielded HABM-Ac (amorphous solid, 4.0 g) and 8a (m.p.:
221-223°, 1.8 g).
Methylation of 8, 8a and 1a
The ethereal solution of diazomethane previously pre-
pared from Diazald was added in excess to solutions of 8,
8a and 1a in methanol to yield 8c (m.p.: 189-91 °C, 60.0
mg), 8b (m.p.: 111-113 °C, 1.8 g) and 2a (m.p.: 119-
121 °C, 15.0 mg), respectively. The presence of these prod-
ucts was revealed by spectral analysis and comparison with
the data of the corresponding natural compounds.
