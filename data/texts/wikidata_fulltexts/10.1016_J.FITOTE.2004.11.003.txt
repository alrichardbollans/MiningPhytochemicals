IntroductionLeontodon filii (Hochst. ex Seub.) Paiva et Orm [1] is one of some 50 species of theLeontodon spp., endemic to the Azores Archipelago and growing wild at 400–800 mabove sea-level in S. Miguel, Terceira, S. Jorge, Pico and Flores Islands. This plant is usedas a herbal remedy in the Azores, mainly due to its diuretic, choleretic and cholagogueeffects.The natural products described in the literature as constituents of Leontodon spp. aremainly sesquiterpene lactones, phenolic compounds, sterols and pentacyclic triterpenes.The occurrence of guaiane type compounds has been reported from two species of theLeontodon spp., namely L. autumnalis [2,3] and L. hispidus [4,5] of which thehypocretenolides were found to possess cytotoxic [5] and antiinflammatory activities[6]. The sesquiterpene lactone glucoside glucozaluzanin C [7] and a germacranolideglucoside [8] were found in the methanol extract of the aerial parts of L. cichoraceus.Phenolic compounds were detected in the aerial parts of L. taraxacoides. The majorcompounds were the flavonoids apigenin, luteolin and their glucosides, as well as caffeicacid, and chlorogenic and isochlorogenic acids [9]. HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS analyses ofthe subgenus Oporinia [10] and of L. helveticus, L. autumnalis and L. hispidus [11] led tothe identification of flavonoids, phenolic acids and sesquiterpene lactones.The pharmacological activities reported for plant sterols and triterpenes includeantitumor and cytotoxic, antihypercholesteremic, antiinflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti-bacterial, analgesic, antitussive and expectorant [12]. The aerial parts of L. autumnaliscontain campesterol, but h-sitosterol, h-amyrin and a-amyrin, which are minorconstituents common in Compositae, were not found in the extract studied [12].We now wish to present the evidence which led to the establishment of the structure ofthe major constituents of the chloroform extract of L. filii, which include the newtriterpenetetrol (1) (Fig. 1), in addition to h-sitosterol, h-amyrin, a-amyrin and its acetate.RRHH32RR211512H1    R = OH2    R = OAcFig. 1. Structure of Compounds 1 and 2.Z. Tostão et al. / Fitoterapia 76 (2005) 173–180 175Moreover we assayed the effectiveness of the chloroform and methanol extracts on someplant pathogen fungi, namely Plasmopara viticola, Pyricularia oryzae and Botrytiscinerea with a view to the possible use of the plant extract as a natural pesticide.2. Experimental2.1. MethodsMelting points were determined with a digital melting point apparatus (electro-thermal) and are uncorrected. The optical rotation was measured with a Perkin–Elmer343 polarimeter. 1H NMR (400.1 MHz) and 13C NMR (100.6 MHz) spectra, DEPT,HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY spectra were acquired on a Bruker ARX 400, inCDCl3 using TMS as internal standard. The 1D and1H and 13C were acquired understandard conditions. The 2D inverse hydrogen detected hetereonuclear shift correlationspectrum was acquired with the gradient selected HMQC pulse sequence [1J(C,H)] with256 time increments collected for each dataset and zero filling to 512, and sixteentransients were collected for each time increment. The 2D inverse hydrogen detectedhetereonuclear long-range shift correlation was carried out with the gradient selectedHMBC pulse sequence [nJ(C,H) optimized for 7 Hz] with 256 time increments collectedfor each dataset and zero filling to 512, thirty-two transients being collected for eachtime increment. For 2D 1H,1H NOESY the gradient selected pulse sequence was usedwith 1.5 s as the mixing time, ten transients were collected for each of the 256 timeincrements and zero filled to 512 [13].IR spectra (cm1) were obtained on a Mattson Satellite FTIR spectrophotometer in KBrpellets. Low-resolution EIMS were taken at 70 eV using a Hewlett-Packard 5930spectrometer, and HRMS was carried out with a Micromass VG ZAB-2F spectrometer.Analytical and PTLC were carried out on Merck 60 GF254 silica gel plates (absorbentthickness: 0.25 and 0.75 mm, respectively). CC was performed using silica gel 60G(0.040–0.063 mm, E. Merck) and eluted under low pressure. The standard compounds a-amyrin, h-amyrin and h-sitosterol were supplied by Extrasynthese, France.2.2. Plant materialL. filii aerial parts, collected in July, in the Azores were dried in the shade. A voucherspecimen nr. INOVA-129 is deposited in the Museum bCarlos MachadoQ Herbarium(Azores).2.3. Extraction and isolationThe air-dried and finely powdered aerial parts of L. filii (266 g) were extracted withCHCl3 at room temperature. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave anextract (6.5 g), which was subjected to CC eluted with EtOAc/hexane mixtures ofincreasing polarity. The two eluates (A—1.5 g and B—430 mg) containing the majorcompounds of the extract were refractionated with benzene (A) to give a-amyrin acetateZ.

Biological assaysDetection of fungicidal efficacy of the crude methanol and chloroform extract solutionsagainst Botrytis cinerea, Erysiphe graminis, Fusarium culmorum, Plasmopara vitı́cola,and Pyricularia oryzae was performed in greenhouse using the plants Capsicum annum(pepper) (B. cinerea), Triticum aestivum (wheat) (E. graminis, F. culmorum), Vitis vinifera(grapevine) (P. viticola) and Oryza sativa (rice) (P. oryzae). The crude extract (200 mg)was dissolved in acetone/water 9:1 (v/v) (200 ml). Each tested plant was sprayed with theextract solution (50 ml). One day (C. annum, T. aestivum, E. graminis, F. culmorum, O.sativa) or 1 week (V. vinifera) after spraying, the plant was inoculated by spraying with thespore suspension (106 spores/ml) of the pathogenic fungus. The results of the protectiveeffect of the extracts were evaluated after 1 week of incubation using a scale from 0 to 8(0—total infection; 8—complete control of the infection). The screening includes a controltest, in which the plant is inoculated without being previously sprayed with the crudeextract, and also a standard test with the commercial specific fungicides for the testedfungi with well-known efficacy.3. Results and discussion3.1. Structure elucidationThe chloroform extract of the aerial parts of L. filii was subjected to columnchromatography to give the new compound 1, together with h-sitosterol, h-amyrin, a-amyrin and a-amyrin acetate. Compound 1 gave a positive Liebermann–Burchard reactionand had a molecular formula of C30H50O4 (HRMS m/z 474.37090).The IR absorption band of 1 at 3442 cm1 indicates the presence of the hydroxylgroups. Acetylation of compound 1 gave the tetraacetate 2 whose 1H NMR spectrumexhibited the signals of the four acetoxymethyl groups detected at y 2.02, 2.04, 2.05 and2.06. The EIMS spectrum of this compound showed peaks characteristic of thefragmentation of one to four molecules of acetic acid at m/z 582 (1.3%), m/z 522(8.8%), m/z 462 (3.4%) and m/z 402 (32%). The retro Diels–Alder fragmentation with lossof one or two molecules of acetic acid gave the fragment ions at m/z 274 and 214.1H NMR and 13C NMR data of the oleanene tetrol 1 are given in Table 1. Two-dimensional correlation experiments (COSY, HMQC, HMBC and NOESY) were carriedout in order to deduce that four hydroxyl groups are present at positions 2, 3 on ring A,Z. Tostão et al. / Fitoterapia 76 (2005) 173–180178position 15 on ring D and position 21 on ring E. The olefinic proton at y 5.29 (H-12) ischaracteristic of the oleanene skeleton type, together with the presence of eight methylgroups, appearing as singlets at y 0.95 (2 Me), y 1.02 (3 Me), y 1.09, 1.23 and y 1.26.The resonance of H-2 appears at y 4.09 as br dd, coupled with H-3 at y 3.22 with acoupling constant of J2,3 3.6 Hz, consistent with an equatorial/axial coupling of twovicinal cis-protons. The NOESY spectrum presented the correlation of H-3 with themultiplet at y 0.81–0.87, which includes H-5 and H-6a,h, from which the orientation ofOH-2 and OH-3, both in position h, can be confirmed (Fig. 2). H-15 appears as a dd aty 4.54, the signal corresponding to C-15 being detected at y 67.04 by HMQC. Thecoupling constants J15h,16a 11.2 Hz and J15h,16h 5.0 Hz are in agreement with OH-15 ina-position, which is also confirmed by NOE experiments, due to the observedinteractions of H-15 with H-18, with Me-28, and with the multiplet at y 1.63–1.68,which includes H-16a and H-16h. The resonance of H-21 at y 3.74 is a dd due to thecoupling with H-22a and H-22h presenting a J21a,22a 4.0 Hz and J21a,22h 12.4 Hzsuggesting that H-21 is in a-orientation, which is confirmed by its NOESY correlationswith H-19a, H-22a, Me-29 and Me-30.The 13C NMR chemical shifts of the detected signals for the methyl groups of 1 are inthe same order of magnitude as the corresponding methyl groups of the h-amyrin skeleton[14] with the exception of Me-28 which appears at y 18.7, due to the presence of OH-15and OH-21. Their assignments and those of C-4, C-8, C-10, C-14, C-17 and C-20 wereconfirmed by HMBC (Table 1).The HRMS pattern also supports the proposed structure. The loss of a water moleculefrom the molecular ion resulted in the peak corresponding to the fragment at m/z 456. Theother three peaks are due to the loss of water molecules and methyl groups respectively atm/z 441 [M–H2O–Me]+, at m/z 438 [M+–2H2O]+and m/z 423 [M+–2H2O–Me]+. The retroDiels–Alder fragmentation results in the fragment ion at m/z 250, which is characteristic ofD12-unsaturated pentacyclic triterpenes and contains the D and E rings corresponding to[C16H26O2]+, confirming the presence of two hydroxyl groups in these rings. The loss ofwater gave the fragment [C16H24O]+. The ion peak at m/z 203 corresponds to the fragmention [C15H23]+.HOHOHHHHHHHHHOHHOHHH23 5151628182930212219HH1Fig. 2.

Tostão et al. / Fitoterapia 76 (2005) 173–180 1793.2. Fungicidal activityA total of five microorganisms were used, namely E. graminis, F. culmorum, P.vitı́cola, P. oryzae and B. cinerea. These fungi are often responsible for the decay offoodstuff, and damage of economically important crops such as wheat, wine, rice andpepper. The plants tested (Table 2) were previously sprayed with methanol or chloroformextract solutions in acetone/water 1:9 (v/v) and then inoculated with the tested fungi sporesuspension (106 spores/ml, distilled water). Control tests were prepared using the sameprocedure in the absence of the extract solution. The protective effect of the extracts wasassessed based on comparison with the results obtained using standard fungicides underthe same experimental conditions (Table 2). These preliminary tests showed that thechloroform extract is moderately efficient against B. cinerea, while both extracts areconsidered good rice protective agents, exhibiting a high level of inhibition of P. oryzae,which produces only intermittent infection in the tested plant. These extracts alsodemonstrated slight efficacy against P. viticola.AcknowledgementsWe are extremely grateful to BASF-AG, Limburgerhof, Germany, for the facilitiesprovided for the trials to evaluate the fungicidal efficacy and for technical support.References[1] Amaral-Franco J.
