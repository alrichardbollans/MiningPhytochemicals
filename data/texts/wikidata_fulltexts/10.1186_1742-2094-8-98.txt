Abstract
Background: Neuroinflammation has been known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Activation of microglia and astrocytes is a characteristic of brain inflammation. Epidemiological studies have
shown that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) delays the onset of AD and
suppresses its progression. Methyl salicylate-2-O-b-D-lactoside (DL0309) is a new molecule chemically related to
salicylic acid. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of DL0309.
Findings: Our studies show that DL0309 significantly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of the pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a; and the expression of the inflammation-related proteins iNOS, COX-
1, and COX-2 by microglia and astrocytes. At a concentration of 10 μM, DL0309 prominently inhibited LPS-induced
activation of NF-B in glial cells by blocking phosphorylation of IKK and p65, and by blocking IB degradation.
Conclusions: We demonstrate here for the first time that DL0309 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in glial cells by
suppressing different pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS/NO. Furthermore, it also regulates the NF-B signaling
pathway by blocking IKK and p65 activation and IB degradation. DL0309 also acts as a non-selective COX
inhibitor in glial cells. These studies suggest that DL0309 may be effective in the treatment of neuroinflammatory
disorders, including AD.
Findings
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenera-
tive disorder of the elderly characterized by global deficits
in cognition ranging from loss of memory to impaired
judgment. It has been hypothesized that early microglial
activation in AD delays disease progression by promoting
clearance of beta amyloid peptide (Ab) before formation
of senile plaques [1-3]. Microglia are antigen-presenting
cells that, upon activation, are capable of phagocytosis
and the production of various pro-inflammatory mole-
cules such as nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-1b (IL-
1b) [4]. These molecules are able to destroy pathogens,
but can also induce toxicity in neurons, which are com-
promised in AD. Furthermore, in aged human brain,
many microglia are dystrophic, showing morphological
features indicative of senescence such as fragmented
cytoplasmic processes [5]. Like microglia, chronically
activated astrocytes are believed to contribute to AD
through production of NO and of various pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines and chemokines. Apart from this, astro-
cytes become activated around plaques to take up Ab
and neuronal debris [6]. Not only that, activated astro-
cytes are also involved in plaque formation. Therefore,
agents that block the activation of microglia and astro-
cytes may be effective in the treatment of AD.
A recent study showed that the administration of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could delay
progression of AD, most likely because of their ability to
reduce microglial activation and cytokine release. The
presence of inflammatory processes in AD brains sug-
gests that anti-inflammatory agents like ibuprofen may
be beneficial in this disease [7]. NSAIDs have been well
studied, both in vitro and in vivo, and have been observed
to ameliorate inflammation related to Ab deposition in
AD. Several in vitro studies have shown that NSAIDs like

blocking the NF-B signaling pathway [8].
Methyl salicylate 2-O-b-D-lactoside (DL0309, Figure 1)
was isolated from Gaultheria yunnanensis (FRANCH) )
REHDER (G yunnanensis), which is a traditional Chinese
herbal medicine. G yunnanensis is widely used for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, swelling, and pain [9].
Interestingly, DL0309 contains a chemical structure
similar to salicylic acid. Therefore, it is a natural salicylic
derivative, and belongs to the NSAIDs group. An anti-
inflammatory effect of Gaultheria has been demon-
strated in a croton oil-induced ear edema model in mice
[10]. Therefore, we investigated the capacity of DL0309
to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines (IL-6, IL-1b,a n dT N F - a)a n dt h ee x p r e s s i o no f
inflammation-related proteins (iNOS, COX-1, and
COX-2) in LPS-activated microglia and astrocytes, and
we explored the association of these effects with activa-
tion of the NF-B pathway.
Primary rat glia cells were obtained through a modifica-
tion of McCarthy and deVellis’s protocol [11]. Primary
cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10%
FBS (Gibco), 1.4 M L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin; and were found to be of 95% pur-
ity as determined by immunocytochemical staining with
ox42 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
antibody.
To investigate the anti-inflammatory actions of DL0309,
microglia and astrocytes were incubated with DL0309 (0.1,
1.0 or 10 μM) in the presence or absence of LPS (0.5 μg/
ml) for 24 h. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b and
TNF-a) levels in the culture medium were measured by
ELISA. The production of NO-derivative nitrite was deter-
mined by the Griess reaction as described previously [12].
Western blot analysis was carried out evaluating the
expression of iNOS, COX-1, COX-2, and NF-Bp a t h w a y -
relevant proteins such as IB-a, total/phosphorylated IKK
and NF-B-p65. Cells were plated overnight in 100 mm
dishes and pre-treated with DL0309 at concentrations of
0.1, 1.0 or 10 μM for 1 h. After exposing the cells to LPS
(0.5 μg/ml) for either 10 min or 45 min, cytosolic protein
extracts were prepared. COX-1 and COX-2 antibodies
were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Other anti-
bodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA). Western blotting results were quanti-
fied using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).
To determine the direct inhibitory effects of DL0309
on COX-1 and COX-2 enzymatic activities, primary rat
glial cells were pre-incubated with LPS (0.5 μg/ml) for
24 h. Medium was then removed, and DL0309 (0.1, 1.0
or 10 μM) was added for 1 h. Cells were treated with
arachidonic acid, 30 μM, for another 20 min, and PGE2
levels in the medium were then measured by ELISA
[13,14]. To investigate the effect of DL0309 on COX-1
enzymatic activity, cells were not treated with LPS in
order to express only the COX-1 isoform [15]. Thus,
measured PGE2 levels represent COX-1 activity alone.
At least three independent experiments were used for
data analysis. All data are presented as mean ± S.E.M.
Values were compared using a t-test (two groups) or
one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls
test (multiple comparisons).
Cell viability was determined by an MTT reduction assay
as described previously [12]. DL0309 did not show toxicity
to the cells at the concentrations examined (Figure 2A). As
shown by Griess assay, incubation with LPS alone mark-
edly increased (about 8-fold) NO production in the cells,
compared to that generated in control cells; DL0309 inhib-
ited LPS-induced NO release in microglia and astrocytes,
both in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). Further-
more, LPS increased the protein expression of iNOS both
in microglia (Figure 2C) and astrocytes (Figure 2D), while
pretreatment with DL0309 significantly decreased iNOS
expression at a concentration of 10 μM. These results
demonstrate that DL0309 inhibits NO release, at least in
part by suppressing iNOS expression.
Neuroinflammation, represented by activated microglia
and astrocytes, is a prominent pathological feature that
c o n t r i b u t e st on e u r o d e g e n e r a t i o ni nA D .I nA Db r a i n ,
activated microglia release a variety of neurotoxic com-
pounds and pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6,
IL-1b and TNF-a. As shown in Figure 3, IL-6 (A), IL-1b
(B) and TNF-a (C) levels were increased in culture med-
ium of LPS-stimulated glial cells. Our results show that
DL0309 significantly inhibits production of these proin-
flammatory cytokines, which may modulate AD.
Sustained up-regulation of pro-inflammatory media-
tors such as COX-1 and COX-2 in microglia and astro-
cytes contributes to the progressive character of AD.
LPS treatment significantly increased protein expression
of COX-1 and COX-2 in both microglia (Figure 4A)

Page 2 of 7and astrocytes (Figure 4B). Pre-treatment with DL0309
reduced this protein expression in a dose-dependent
manner in microglia. Additionally, DL0309 also directly
inhibited total COX (COX-1/2, Figure 4C) and COX-1
(Figure 4D) activity in a dose-dependent manner. These
results show that DL0309 acts as a non-selective COX
inhibitor both in microglia and in astrocytes. These stu-
dies suggest that DL0309 may be effective in the treat-
ment of these disorders.
NF-B is known as an important regulator of various
genes involved in the production of many pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines and enzymes related to the inflammatory
process. Activation of NF-B is critical for the expression
of various cytokines, iNOS, COX-1 and COX-2 in micro-
glia in response to LPS [16]. Normally NF-B remains
inactivated by an inhibitory protein, IB. Once activated,
NF-B enters the nucleus to increase transcription of dif-
ferent inflammatory mediators. The phosphorylation of
IB is regulated by IKK. Thus, we studied the effects of
DL0309 on NF-B activation. LPS strongly increased
phosphorylated IKK (Figure 5) and NF-B-p65 (Figure 6),
while simultaneously decreasing IB expression (Figure 7)
in primary microglia (A) and astrocytes (B). Our studies
demonstrate that DL0309 regulates the NF-B pathway by
suppressing LPS induction of pIKK and pNF-B-p65
activity in glial cells. We further demonstrated that
DL0309 blocks LPS-induced degradation of IB, which
blocks the nuclear translocation of NF-B.
In recent years, a number of mechanisms have been
proposed to account for the protective effects of aspirin
[17,18], ibuprofen [19] and other anti-inflammatory
agents in AD. Studies have shown various degrees (risk
reductions of up to 50%) of benefit from the use of
NSAIDs on onset of disease and on dementia, with
increased duration of NSAIDs use having increased pro-
tective effect against AD [20]. The best characterized
action of these anti-inflammatory agents is to suppress
neuroinflammation, primarily through their ability to
inhibit COX, leading to reduced biosynthesis of pro-
inflammatory molecules in glial cells. Several studies

Page 5 of 7have shown that the onset of AD may be apparently
suppressed or delayed by mixed COX-1 and COX-2
inhibitors [21].
In summary, we demonstrate that DL0309 is capable
of acting as a non-selective inhibitor of COX-1 and
COX-2. DL0309 also regulates the NF-B signaling
pathway not only by blocking degradation of IB, but
also by restraining pIKK and pNF-B-p65 activity.
Therefore, this agent can suppress proteins that are
regulated by the NF-B pathway, including iNOS, NO
and the cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a. These studies
suggest that DL0309 may be an effective agent in the
treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders, including
AD.
