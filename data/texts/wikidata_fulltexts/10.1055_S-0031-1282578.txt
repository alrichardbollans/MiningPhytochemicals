Submitted for publication.RESULTS and DISCUSSION Performing N-alkylamide profiling in Anacyclus pyrethrum, 13 compounds areidentified of which 5 are new and not yet reported in plants.Drug Quality & Registration (DruQuaR) format Man06.001.006-v01CONCLUSIONSREFERENCESThe roots of Anacyclus pyrethrum (AP) DC, (Asteraceae)are frequently used in traditional medicine e.g. asaphrodisiac. Currently, thirteen N-alkylamides (N-AAs),including isobutylamides (IBAs), tyramides (4-OH PEAs), N-methyl isobutylamides (N-Me IBAs) and a 2-phenylethylamide (2-PEA), with pellitorine (#3) as major N-AA, have been identified in AP [1,2].HPLC/UV/ESI-MS N-AAs profiling of an ethanolic extract from the dry roots of APwas performed using a prevail RPC18 (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) column with anoptimized linear gradient consisting of 1% acetic acid in ultrapure water andacetonitrile. MS was performed in the positive mode. Identification was based on them/z values and characteristic fragmentation ions in MS1 and CID-MS2 [3].DruQuaRDepending on the extraction method and solvent, different yields of N-AAs can befound, possibly resulting in alterations in biological effects. Therefore, analyticalprofiling of the bio-active N-AA in these plant preparations is conditio sine qua nonparameter, with HPLC/ESI-MS as recommended technique for comprehensivecharacterisation of N-AAs in plant extracts [3]. For the first time, an exhaustive N-AA profiling of an AP extract is performed, using HPLC/UV/ESI-MS.Thirteen N-AAs (4,87% m/m) were detected (Fig. 1). Compound 1-7 have previouslybeen reported in AP [1,2], while compound A has only been documented in otherAsteraceae genera. The five other ones (#B-F) have never been identified in AP orother plants, and are thus totally new [4].Fig 2.
