IntroductionCardiac glycosides are a class of secondary metabolites that aretraditionally used to increase cardiac contractile force in patientswith congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias (Abarquez,2001). Throughout history, cardiac glycoside-containing plants ortheir extracts have been used as arrow poisons, emetics, diuretics,and heart tonics (Kinne-Saffran and Kinne, 2002).Calotropis procera (Aiton) W. T. Aiton (Asclepiadaceae) is atraditionalmedicinal plant growingwild fromWest Africa to SouthEast Asia. Themilky juice of the plant is used in India as a purgative,and the ﬂowers are used as a digestive, a stomachic and a tonic andhave an anti-asthmatic effect. The root bark is useful in treatingskin diseases, enlargement of the abdominal viscera, intestinalworms and ascites (Khan and Malik, 1989). Further, the root of C.procera is used as a carminative in the treatment of dyspepsia(Kumar and Arya, 2006). The aqueous extract of the latex inhibitscellular inﬁltration and protects against the development ofneoplastic changes in the transgenic mouse model of hepatocellu-lar carcinoma (Choedon et al., 2006). The chloroform extract of theroot exhibits protective activity against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage (Basu et al., 1992).According to literature reports C. procera contains cardiacglycosides (Elgamal et al., 1999; Hanna et al., 1999, 2002),triterpenes (Bhutani et al., 1992, Khan et al., 1988), sterols (Khanand Malik, 1989) and ﬂavonoids (Mossa et al., 1991). The broadpharmacological proﬁle of C. procera could be interesting for thepharmaceutical industry to develope new drugs (Silva et al., 2010).Therefore, the present investigation of constituents of vegetativestems is part of an extended effort to determine the secondarymetabolites of C. procera and to study their pharmacologicalactivities. The isolatedmetabolites were evaluated for their in vitrocytotoxic activity against the human cancer cell lines HT29 andHepG2 and the mouse ﬁbroblast cell line NIH-3T3 as well asantimicrobial activity.2. Results and discussion2.1. IsolationThe ethanol extract of vegetative stems of C. procera wasfractionated by ﬂash column chromatography; resulting fractionswere eluted with benzene then with chloroform containingincreasing proportions of methanol. Compound 1 was obtainedfrom the chloroform fraction by further puriﬁcation on medium-pressure liquid chromatographs (MPLC) using chloroform/metha-nol as an eluent. Elution of the silica gel column with chloroform/methanol resulted in a semi-solid fraction, which was puriﬁed onSephadex LH-20, ﬂash chromatography, and MPLC to yield purecompounds 2–5 (see Section 3 for details).2.2. Structure elucidationThe molecular formula of compound 1 (C23H24O11) wasdeduced from HRESIMS m/z ([M+H]+) 477.13995.

Theoccurrence of signals of an AB spin system of H-6 (d 6.73) and H-8(d 6.85) and an AA0XX0 spin system of a p-substituted phenyl ring atd 7.26 (H-30/50) and d 8.00 (H-20/60) in the aromatic part of the 1HNMR and 1H,1H-COSY spectra of compound 1 suggested thepresence of a ﬂavonoid structure of the aglycon. Typical 1H NMRsignals of two methoxy groups at d 3.84 and 3.99 correlated in theHMBC spectrum to the 13C NMR signals at d 134.4 (C-3) and 160.8(C-7), respectively, suggesting that one methoxyl group is locatedat C-3 and the other at C-7. Another HMBC cross-peak of H-8 (d6.85) conﬁrmed the assignment of C-7. From these data, compound1 was preliminary identiﬁed as a 3,7-dimethoxykaempferolglycoside. The aglycon has been reported from many plants,including Flourensia cernua (Asteraceae) (Dillon et al., 1976) andEricameria diffusa (Compositae) (Urbatsch et al., 1976).Signals of a hydroxymethylene group of H-600 (d 4.00; d 3.72) andthe doublet of H-100 at d 5.05 (J = 7.7 Hz) and further signals of H-2 toH-5atd3.4–3.5 indicated ahexoseunit,which isb-conﬁguredat theanomeric center. The assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR signals ofthe glucose unit was supported by 1H,1H-COSY and HSQC data. The13C chemical shifts of the hexose carbon atomswere consistentwitha b-glucopyranose (Agrawal, 1992). The position of the glucosemoiety at C-40 (d 162.2) was established by a HMBC key correlationwith H-100. Therefore, compound 1was identiﬁed as 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyﬂavone-40-O-b-glucopyranoside, which is a new naturalproduct. 13C NMR data of a compound, which were interpreted as 1(Pan et al., 1993), are inconsistentwith the spectral characteristics ofthe structure herein described (Fig. 1).On the basis of mass spectrometric and 1D and 2D NMRspectroscopic data, compound 2 was identiﬁed as uzarigenine(Elgamal et al., 1999) and compound 3 as b-anhydroepidigitox-igenin, which previously was isolated from the roots of Neriumoleander (Mostaqul Huq et al., 1999).Compound4was obtained as awhite powder. TheHRESIMS data(m/z 419.24455 [M+1]+), which corresponded to the molecularformula C24H34O6, and the1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1), indicatedan isomer of the previously isolated (19S)-3b,19-epoxy-2a,14b-dihydroxy-19-methoxy-5a-card-20(22)-enolide (6) (Hanna et al.,2002). The 13C chemical shift values of the two compounds wereverysimilar, except thoseofC-2(4:d71.0;6:d67.1),C-3(4:d67.5;6:d71.8) and the acetal carbonC-19 (4: d105.7;6: 101.3), suggesting astructural difference at C-2 and/or C-3. A cross-signal in the HMBCspectrum of 4 indicated a three-bond distance between H-2 (d 3.77)and C-19, which is explained by the oxygen at C-2 being involved inthe acetal bridge overarching ring A. The coupling constant 3JH-2–H-3 = 5.1 Hz suggested the equatorial orientation of H-3. Aftercomplete assignment of 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts by meansof 1H,1H-COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra, the relative stereochem-istry of compound4was inferred froma2DROESY spectrum. ROESYcorrelations of H-5 (d 0.96) with H-3 (d 4.00) indicated the axial a-orientation of these protons, while ROESY correlations of H-19 (d4.60) with H-8b (d 2.00), H-11b (d 1.28) and H-6b (d 1.57) revealedthat these protons are b-oriented (Fig. 2). Based on the abovementioned ﬁnding, compound 4 was identiﬁed as 2b,19-epoxy-3b,14b-dihydroxy-19-methoxy-5a-card-20(22) enolide.HRESIMS of compound 5 showed a molecular ion peak of m/z519.29764 ([M+H]+), corresponding to the molecular formula ofC29H42O8, and suggesting eight unsaturation equivalents in themolecule. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets of doublets(J = 17.8, 1.8 Hz) at d 4.85 and 4.94 for H-21a and H-21b,[(Fig._1)TD$FIG]Fig. 1. Structures of new compounds 1, 4 and 5. Compound 6 was used as a reference for structural analysis.K.H. Shaker et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 3 (2010) 212–216 213Author's personal copyrespectively, and a doublet at d 5.95 (J = 1.8 Hz), assignable to H-22of an a,b-unsaturated-g-lactone ring of cardenolide (Siddiquiet al., 1997). The signal of another oleﬁnic proton at d 5.30(J = 1.8 Hz)wasassigned toH-15. The twomethyl signalsofC-18andC-19 appeared at d 0.84 and 0.87, respectively. The doublet at d 4.40was attributed to the proton at the anomeric center of a hexose unit,andthevalueof thecouplingconstant 3JH-100–H-200 = 7.8 Hzreﬂects theb-conﬁgurationofH-100. In addition, couplingconstants between8.0and 9.0 Hz (Table 1) indicated that H-200–H-500 are also in axialorientation,which is consistentwithaglucoseunit. 1H-1H-COSYandHSQC cross-signalswere used to assign 1H and 13C chemical shifts ofthe b-glucose. HMBC key correlation of H-10 with the C-3 (d 79.2)revealed the connectivity of the glucose to C-3 of the b-anhydroepidigitoxigenin moiety. The full 1H and 13C signal assign-ments were established by APT, 1H,1H-COSY, HMQC and HMBC,which togetherwith theMSdata lead to the structureof compound5as b-anhydroepidigitoxigenin-3b-O-glucopyranoside.2.3. BioassaysMetabolites 1–5 were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activityagainst the human cancer cell lines HT29 and HepG2 and themouse ﬁbroblast cell line NIH-3T3. Uzarigenine (2) reduced themetabolic activity of HT29 and HepG2 cells at a concentration of50 mM by 59% and 35%, respectively, while no inhibition of themetabolic activity of NIH-3T3 cells was observed. In addition,compound 1 (50 mM) caused a decrease of themetabolic activity ofNIH-3T3 and HepG2 cells by 18% and 10%, respectively, whereascompounds 2, 3 and 5 displayed no activity. Antimicrobial assaysrevealed no signiﬁcant activities in tested compounds 1–5.3. Experimental3.1.

A voucher specimen is deposited at theHerbarium of the National Research Centre, CP.05.006MG, Cairo,Egypt.3.3. Extraction and isolationThe freshly ground stems of C. procera (20 kg) were exhaus-tively extracted at room temperature with 70% ethanol. Thesolvent was evaporated under vacuum at 45 8C and the residue(500 g) was fractionated by ﬂash column chromatography usingsilica gel (40–63mm). Benzene, followed by chloroform andchloroform containing an increasing proportion of methanol, wasused as a mobile phase. Chromatographic fractions were analyzedfor natural products by TLC. Elution with chloroform gave rise to2.0 g of semi-solid residue after the solvent was evaporated. Theresidue was subjected to MPLC and eluted with benzene followedby chloroform to afford 0.1 g of crude compound 1; this was re-chromatographed by MPLC using chloroform containing anincreasing proportion of methanol to afford pure compound 1(3.3 mg). Elution of the ﬂash chromatography column withchloroform–methanol (9:2) gave rise to 5.0 g of a semi-solidresidue, which was re-chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 usingmethanol as an eluent. Fractions 15–20 (1.0 g) were subjected toﬂash chromatography using chloroform containing an increasingproportion of methanol for elution to afford a crude mixture ofcompounds 2–4 (200 mg). The mixture was puriﬁed by MPLC withgradient elution (chloroform: methanol 0–50% methanol in60 min) to give uzarigenin (2) (4.0 mg), b-anhydroepidigitox-igenin (3) (20.0 mg) and 2a,19-epoxy-3b,14b-dihydroxy-19-methoxy-5a-card-20(22)-enolide (4) (4.2 mg). Fractions 25–27(0.3 g) were re-chromatographed by MPLC using chloroform-methanol (9:1) as an eluent to afford b-anhydroepidigitoxigenin-3b-O-b-glucopyranoside (5) (8.0 mg). The purity of compounds 2–4 was examined by HPLC (LiChrosphere 100 RP-18,250 mm  4 mm; 5mm; H2O–MeOH (0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid)gradient from 10% to 95% MeOH in 35 min; ﬂow rate 0.8 ml min1).3.4.
