Metabolic and biochemical changes in streptozotocin induced obese-diabetic rats 
treated with Phyllanthus niruri extract 
ABSTRACT 
Herbal medicine has been proven to be an effective therapy offering a variety of benefits, 
such as moderate reduction in hypoglycemia, in the treatment and prevention of obesity and 
diabetes. Phyllanthus niruri has been used as a treatment for diabetes mellitus. Herein, the 
induction of type 2 diabetes in Sprague–Dawley rats was achieved by a low dose of 
streptozotocin (STZ) (25 mg/kg bw). Here, we evaluated the in vivo antidiabetic properties of 
two concentrations (250 and 500 mg/kg bw) of P. niruri via metabolomics approach. The 
administration of 500 mg/kg bw of P. niruri extract caused the metabolic disorders of obese 
diabetic rats to be improved towards the normal state. The extract also clearly decreased the 
serum glucose level and improved the lipid profile in obese diabetic rats. The results of this 
study may contribute towards better understanding the molecular mechanism of this 
medicinal plant in managing diabetes mellitus.
