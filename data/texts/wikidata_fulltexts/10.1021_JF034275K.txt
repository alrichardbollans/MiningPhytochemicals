Jose´ Vasques Oso´rio 62, 5a Apt 137, 5050-280 Peso da Re´gua, PortugalThe aim of this work was to study the relationship between carotenoid contents in grapevine berriesand plant water status. For this purpose, a black grapevine variety, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional,was studied. The experiments were carried out in the same Douro vineyards, with plants of the sameage, in two different water retention soils. A higher water retention capacity soil, soil A, and a lowerwater retention capacity soil, soil B, were both in a 1.2 m deep silt-loam schist-derived soil. Thetraining system was the double cordon trained and spur pruned. A first range was nonirrigated (NI)and a second one was irrigated (I), 60% of evapotranspiration (ET0). For soil B, a 30% of ET0 treatmentwas also applied. The plant water status was estimated by predawn leaf water potential. The effectsof plant water status on berry growth were studied by measurement of the berry weight and totalsoluble solids (°Brix). The carotenoid profile was quantitatively determined by high-performance liquidchromatography/diode array. Carotenoids determined were â-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin,and luteoxanthin. The comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated grapes was followed from 2weeks before veraison until the ripe stage. Results showed that at harvest time, berries exposed tothe NI had a lower weight than those exposed to the irrigated treatment (60% of ET0), 0.89 vs 1.36g/berry and 0.94 vs 1.34 g/berry, for soils A and B, respectively. The irrigated treatment contributedto a higher sugar concentration in both soils. However, depending on the soil water retention capacity,the carotenoid contents were different in soils A and B. For soil A, the total carotenoid content wassimilar for both NI and I treatments. However, with regard to soil B, in irrigated treatment, levels ofcarotenoids were approximately 60% lower than those found for the NI. It seems to be possible toproduce higher weight berries (with higher sugar levels) with similar carotenoid contents. On theother hand, soil characteristics had a larger influence than irrigation on the concentration of carotenoidsin grapes, resulting in an important viticultural parameter to take into account in aroma precursorformation.KEYWORDS: Vitis vinifera; carotenoids; plant water status; irrigation; berry growthINTRODUCTIONThe presence of carotenoids in grapes is well-documented,having been demonstrated that â-carotene and some xantho-phylls (neoxanthin, flavoxanthin, and lutein) are abundant beforeveraison, and subsequently decreasing dramatically (1-3). Threeother xanthophylls, namely, violaxanthin, luteoxanthin, and 5,6-epoxylutein, appear after veraison, when the sugar concentrationreaches approximately 160 g/L (3). Cultivar, viticultural region,exposure to sunlight, and ripening stage all affect carotenoidconcentrations in grapes (4-7). Carotenoids are known asprecursors of C13-norisoprenoid compounds (8, 9), which havebeen identified in grapes and wines and are known to beresponsible for the typical aroma of some varieties.The effect of irrigation on berry composition (°Brix, glucose,fructose, pH, organic acids, mineral elements, and phenoliccontent), color, and weight (g/berry) has been reported by manyauthors (10-15). It is reported that sugar content increases whenirrigation is applied during the ripening stage, while irrigationduring the early stages of berry development brings about anincrease in grape yield together with a decrease in sugarconcentration (10). Recent studies have indicated that weight(g/berry), °Brix, and glucose and fructose concentrations aresignificantly higher in Is than NIs (11, 12). This fact could berelated to a higher vegetative growth (I) resulting in higherpruning weights and a higher leaf area index, where irrigatedvines are not exposed to heat stress as compared to nonirrigated* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The organic acids(tartaric acid, malic acid, and citric acid) are present in highconcentrations in green grapes and begin to decrease at veraison(12). The rate of decrease is greater for malic acid than fortartaric acid, and this difference is greatest in NIs (12). Mediumor severe water deficits, occurring in the early stages of growth,have significant effects on cell size but not on cell division (13),while water deficit levels occurring during the period fromveraison to maturity stimulate phenolic biosynthesis (13-15).The aroma potential during ripening, caused by moderateirrigation, showed higher values for Is (16). The relationshipbetween carotenoid contents in grapevine berries and plant waterstatus has not yet been established. The aim of this present studywas to examine the relationship between carotenoid content ingrapevine berries and plant water status. For this purpose a blackgrapevine variety, Vitis Vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional, wasstudied during the 2 weeks before veraison until full ripeness.The effects of plant water status on berry growth were studiedby measuring the berry weight and °Brix, and the carotenoidprofile was quantitatively determined by high-performance liquidchromatography (HPLC)/diode array.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Material. This experiment was conducted during 1 year (2002)with the variety Vitis Vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional. Vines were 6years old and were planted with 196-17 rootstock in the same vineyardplot in the Douro Superior subregion of northern Portugal.Soils Types, Irrigation, and Sampling. Samples were taken fromvines segregated into elemental plots (45 vines each) defined in termsof soil type and irrigation regime. The sampling period was from 2weeks prior to veraison until full ripeness (19/07, 22/08, 4/09, and 19/09). All plots can be considered equal in terms of vine training system,plant density, and climatic conditions (Table 1). The ET0 was estimatedby the Penman-Monteith method as described by Allen et al. (17).The irrigation period was from 14/06 till 19/09. °Brix was measuredusing a refractometer LEICA-model 7530.Extraction and Determination of Carotenoids. Grape Material.Approximately 50 g of fresh berries, of seeds, were homogenized usinga Turrax homogenizer at 9500 rpm for 15 min. This procedure provided40 g of sample that was spiked with 200 íL of internal standard and170 mg/L of â-apo-8′-carotenal (Fluka, Portugal) (10810) and wasdiluted with 40 mL of water (18.3 M¿/cm). Extraction was carriedout with 40 mL of ether/hexane (1:1, v/v), HPLC grade (MERCK,Portugal), and agitated for 30 min. The extraction was repeated twomore times with 20 mL of ether/hexane (30 min each). The finalcombined extract was concentrated to dryness (rotavapor) and resus-pended in 1 mL of acetone/hexane (1:1, v/v) for HPLC determination.Light exposure was minimized during sample preparations in order toavoid photoisomerization.HPLC. A Beckman model 126 quaternary solvent system, equippedwith a System 32 Karat software and a 168 rapid-scanning, UV-visiblephotodiode array detector, was used.

The largest percentage decreases wereobserved for chlorophyll a, lutein, and â-carotene of 64-89,42-83, and 44-80%, respectively. Violaxanthin and luteo-xanthin appeared only from 22/08 and seem to have slightlyincreased during this period (Table 3). These results are inagreement with previous work where the presence of carotenoidsin grape berries demonstrated that â-carotene and severalxanthophylls are abundant before veraison, with decreasinglevels during ripening. These decreases were less prominentduring the maturation (3).Berry growth was studied by measurement of the berry weightand °Brix (Table 3). Is contributed to an increase of berry sizeand to higher sugar concentrations in both soils (A and B). Thehigher sugar accumulation noted in irrigated vines may berelated to their higher photosynthetic activity as compared towater-stressed vines, prolonging the period of photosyntheticactivity by slowing leaf senescence. This effect can contributeto a lower rate of sugar transport to the berries in nonirrigatedvines (11). Furthermore, higher vegetative growth (I) results inhigher pruning weights and higher leaf area index whereirrigated vines are not exposed to heat stress as compared tononirrigated vines, which suffer high temperatures (12).Figure 2 shows the degree of correlation of carotenoidcontents with different regimes of irrigation in the two differentsoils, while Figure 3 gives the factors scores (factor score plot1-2 accounts for 83% of total variance) from the principalcomponents study carried out with data from Table 3. From adetailed study of these figures, it can be concluded that (i) forthe first stage of maturation (I¥19/07) two different groups canbe seen, a first group (ANI, AI 60%, and BNI) and a secondgroup (BI 30% and BI 60%), that follow different patterns ofvariation. Carotenoids found in nonirrigated and irrigated grapesin the higher water retention capacity soil (ANI and AI 60%)were similar. Because carotenoids are in much higher levels inskins than pulp (17), this nonvariation could be explained bythe fact of observed increases in pulp-skin ratios with Is.Carotenoids found in the nonirrigated grapes in the lower waterretention capacity soil (BNI) are close to those found in thehigher water retention capacity soil (soil A). However, irrigation,in the lower water retention capacity soil (soil B), leads to alower carotenoid concentration in the grapes. Nevertheless,different levels of irrigation, 30% and 60% of ET0, had similarvalues of carotenoids for BI 30% and BI 60%, respectively.Carotenoid contents in irrigated grapes in the lower waterretention soil (BI 60%) were approximately 61 and 68% lowerfor lutein and â-carotene, respectively, than that of the nonir-rigated grapes (BNI).(ii) For the last stage of maturation (IV¥19/09), AI 60% andBNI are well-grouped, indicating that carotenoid levels weresimilar for a nonirrigated lower water retention capacity soil(BNI) and an irrigated higher water retention capacity soil (AI60%).(iii) The other plots, which all exhibit different behaviors,are different from the others. For (II¥22/08 and III¥4/09)stages, Is, in soil B, are well-grouped, with the exception ofthe 60% of ET0 treatment. One these dates carotenoid decreas-ing, during ripeness, slowly down for this treatment. For soilA, the NI and I follows an identical variation in these stages ofripeness.°Brix and berry weight are well-correlated. The correlationcoefficient at the level of significance R ) 0.050 (two-tailedtest) is 0.853. All carotenoids analyzed are well-correlated with°Brix (correlation values higher than -0.6 reach -0.868 forFigure 2.

Although°Brix and berry weight increases were concomitant with I, nodirect effect could be established between these parameters andcarotenoid contents in grapes. Soil characteristics and waterretention capacity affect canopy density and consequently bunchexposure to sunlight. Light has probably the largest effect oncarotenoids content.CONCLUSIONSoil and water retention capacity affect carotenoid contentsin grapes. I seems to contribute to lower carotenoid levels ingrapes, when vines are planted in a lower water retentioncapacity soil. This decrease was similar for both 30 and 60%of ET0. However, in a higher water retention capacity soil, Iseems to have no effect in carotenoid contents when comparedwith NI.It seems possible to produce grapes with higher weight andhigher sugar levels together with similar carotenoid contents inan irrigated higher water retention capacity soil. It is reasonableto establish the possibility of improving wine production togetherwith the eventual presence of substances with high aromaimpact, knowing that carotenoids are precursors of several ofthese aroma compounds. On the other hand, soil characteristicshad a larger influence than irrigation on the concentration ofcarotenoids in grapes, resulting in an important viticulturalparameter to take into account in aroma precursor formation.To gather more information concerning other viticulturalparameters that might help to better understand the results ofthe present work, ongoing research is under development.ABBREVIATIONS USEDNI, nonirrigated treatment; I, irrigated treatment; ET0, po-tential evapotranspiration; 30% of ET0, 30% of evapotranspira-tion; 60% of ET0, 60% of evapotranspiration; °Brix, total solublesolids; ANI, nonirrigated treatment in soil A; AI 60%, irrigatedtreatment at 60% of evapotranspiration in soil A; BNI, non-irrigated treatment in soil B; BI 60%, irrigated treatment at 60%of evapotranspiration in soil B; BI 30%, irrigated treatment at30% of evapotranspiration in soil B.LITERATURE CITED(1) Razungles, A.; Bayonove, C.; Cordonnier, R.; Baumes, R.
