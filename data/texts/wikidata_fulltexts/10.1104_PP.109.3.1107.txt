Plant Physiol. (1995) 109: 1107-1 114 Local and Systemic Biosynthesis of Salicylic Acid in lnfected Cucumber Plants' Philippe Meuwly, Wolfgang Molders, Antony Buchala, and Jean-Pierre MCtraux* lnstitut de Biologie Végétale, Rue Albert-Gockel 3, Université de Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland Radiolabeling studies showed that salicylic acid (SA), an essential component in the signal transduction pathway leading to systemic acquired resistance, is  synthesized from phenylalanine (Phe) and benzoic acid in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants inoculated with pathogens. Leaf discs from plants inoculated with either to- bacco necrosis virus or Pseudomonas lachrymans incorporated more [14C]Phe into [14C]SA than mock-inoculated controls. l h e  identity of SA was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spec- trometry. No reduction in specific activity of [l4C1SA was observed for either free or bound SA between control and infected plants after feeding [14C]Phe. A specific inhibitor of Phe ammonia-lyase, 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid, completely inhibited the incor- poration of [14C]Phe into [14C]SA, although plants treated with 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid could still produce [l4C1SA from [14C]benzoic acid. Biosynthesis of SA in tissue inoculated with tobacco necrosis virus followed a transient pattern with the highest induction occurring 72 h postinoculation. Uninfected tissues from an infected plant synthesized de novo more SA than did controls. This suggests the involvement of a systemic signal triggering SA synthesis in tissue distant from the site of infection that display systemic acquired resistance. Disease-resistance mechanisms are induced in plants upon attack by necrotizing pathogens (fungi, bacteria, vi- ruses) (Kuc, 1982; Madamanchi and Kuc, 1991). The resis- tance is expressed at the site of infection (local resistance) as well as in other uninfected parts of the plant (SAR) (Malamy and Klessig, 1992; Raskin, 1992; Métraux, 1994; Ryals et al., 1994). The separation in time and space of the primary infection and SAR implies the translocation of an endogenous signal. When SA is applied to a variety of plants, a broad range of defense responses are induced (White, 1979; Ward et al., 1991). SA, found in the phloem sap of infected cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) (Métraux et al., 1990; Rasmussen et al., 1991) and tobacco plants (Malamy et al., 1990), was pro- posed as a putative signaling molecule for the induction of SAR (Malamy and Klessig, 1992; Raskin, 1992; Métraux, 1994; Ryals et al., 1994). In tobacco, free and bound SA are produced around the infection site, whereas only free SA is detected in dista1 regions (Yalpani et al., 1991; Enyedi et al., 1992; Malamy et al., 1992). In cucumber (Meuwly and Métraux, 1993; Meuwly et al., 1994; Molders et al., 1994) ' This work was partially supported by grant No. 31-37098.92 * Corresponding author; e-mail jean-pierre.metraux@unifr.ch; from the Swiss National Science Foundation. fax 41-37-29-97-40. and Arabidopsis (Summermatter et al., 1994, 19951, both free and bound SA increase locally and systemically upon pathogen infection. In potato, SA accumulates only locally upon elicitation with arachidonic acid (Meuwly et al., 1993; Coquoz et al., 1995). In rice, no change in SA is measured after inoculation with pathogens (Silverman et al., 1995). However, two surveys using severa1 varieties of potato and rice indicate that pathogen-resistant cultivars contain more endogenous SA than do susceptible ones (Coquoz et al., 1995; Silverman et al., 1995). The role of SA in disease resistance was further characterized using transgenic to- bacco plants expressing salicylate hydroxylase, which de- grades SA into catechol; such plants are unable to express SAR (Gaffney et al., 1993). It is interesting that SAR is restored by grafting a wild-type scion onto a rootstock expressing salicylate hydroxylase, suggesting that, al- though SA may not be the primary signal that moves throughout the plant after a primary infection, it is an essential component in the chain of events leading to SAR (Delaney et al., 1994; Vernooij et al., 1994). Numerous 14C-labeling studies with various plants indi- cate that SA derives from the general shikimate-phenylpro- panoid pathway (Fig. 1). Phe is first converted to CA, which is then either hydroxylated to oCou or chain short- ened to BA, depending on the plant material and the con- ditions used. In leaf segments of Pvimula acaulis and Gault- heria procumbens (Chadha and Brown, 1974), and in tomato seedlings infected with Agrobacterium (El-Basyouni et al., 1964), [I4C]Phe and [14C]CA are first converted to [I4C1o- Cou and then to [14C]SA. The formation of [14C]BA from [14C]Phe via [I4C]CA occurs in Tsuga canadiensis (Zenk and Miiller, 1964), in Gaulthevia pvocumbens tissue (Ellis and Amrhein, 1971), and in uninfected tomato seedlings (Chadha and Brown, 1974). In addition, the direct conver- sion of [14C]BA to ['4C]SA has been reported in etiolated hypocotyls of Helianthus annuus, in Solanum tuberosum tu- bers, in Pisum sativum internodes (Klambt, 1962), and in rice (Silverman et al., 1995). Recently, cell cultures of to- bacco have been shown to incorporate both [I4C]CA and [I4C1BA into [I4C1SA (Yalpani et al., 1993). A benzoate-2- hydroxylase (Fig. 1) that converts BA into SA is induced by TNV in tobacco (Leon et al., 1993).

Putative biosynthetic pathway of SA. Bold arrows indicate the most likely pathway in cucumber plants inoculated with patho- gen. BA2H, Benzoate-2-hydroxylase. In this paper we describe our studies of the pathway leading to increased levels of SA in infected cucumber, a species widely used in studies of SAR. In addition, we demonstrate the systemic induction of de novo synthesis of SA in uninfected leaves of an infected cucumber plant. MATERIALS A N D  METHODS Plants and Pathogen lnoculations Cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L., cv Wisconsin SMR-58) were grown as described previously (Meuwly and Métraux, 1993). TNV was prepared from homoge- nates of cucumber leaves as described previously (Mé- traux et al., 1990). The first leaf of 4-week-old plants or one cotyledon of 3-week-old plants was gently rubbed with a cotton swab soaked in the leaf homogenate with or without TNV for mock and TNV inoculation, respec- tively. Alternatively, the lower surface of the first leaf was inoculated with water (controls) or with 4 X 10' bacteria/mL Pseudomonas lachrymans (Smith and Bryan) Carsner as described previously (Métraux and Boller, 1986; Meuwly and Métraux, 1993). Radiolabeling and Enzyme lnhibitor Treatments At various times after inoculation of cucumber plants (as described in "Results"), leaf discs (18 mm diameter) from controls and infected plants were punched out around the inoculation site on leaf 1 and from the uninfected leaf 2 (located immediately above leaf 1). Ten leaf discs were vacuum infiltrated for 20 s in a glass tube containing 1 mL of buffer solution (100 mM Na acetate, pH 5.5) with either 1 nCi/pL uniformly ring-labeled [U-'"CIBA (13.3 mCi/ mmol), 1 nCi/pL [3-'"C]CA (53.88 mCi/mmol), or 4 nCi/pL uniformly ring-labeled [U-'"C]Phe (464 mCi/ mmol), each treatment with or without 50 p~ AIP (Zon and Amrhein, 1992; Fig. 1). The addition of 20 ng/pL pCou was necessary in ['4C]Phe-feeding experiments to dilute the endogenous pool and to drive high amounts of radioactiv- ity into SA rather than through the lignin precursor and phytoalexin routes (Fig. 1). After vacuum infiltration, leaf et al. Plant Physiol. Vol. 109, 1995 discs were left in Petri dishes on moist filter paper fisr 4 h (['"GIBA, [14ClCA) or 6 h ([l4C1Phe) before collection (10 or 20 discs/sample) and storage at -20°C. The duration of the incubation after the infection and the timing of the labeling were selected on the basis of preliminary results indicating active biosynthesis of SA during the chosen time periods. Alternatively, mock- and TNV-inoculated cotyledons were needle injected with 20 p L  of [I4C]BA (15 nCi/pL) in the treated area 24, 48, and 72 h postinoculation, and the cotyledons were collected 24 h later. Experiments with three replicate samples each were repeated two or three times with similar results. [14C]BA, ['"CIPhe, and ['4C]CA were purchased from Sigma, Amersham, and Isotopchim (Ganagobie-Peyruis, France), respectively. Extraction and HPLC Quantitation of Phenolics oANI was used as an internal standard for the quantita- tion of free and bound phenolics as previously described (Meuwly and Métraux, 1993). The internal standard was extracted with the free phenolic fractions and was therefore absent in the bound fraction (Fig. 2, E and H). The recovery calculated for the free phenolic fraction of an extract was also used for the bound fraction because losses during acid hydrolysis and subsequent partitioning were negligible (less than 5-79?, as measured in samples in which oANI was added to the bound fraction prior to acid hydrolysis). Before the samples were separated by HPLC, the organic phases were evaporated to dryness, and the residues were resuspended in 400 pL of HPLC starting buffer; 200 p L  was taken for analysis. An acetonitrile/phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 3.5) gradient was run as described below at 1.5 mL min-' and at 35°C on a Beckman System Gold HPLC system equipped with a deactivated LC-SAL reversed- phase column (15 cm X 4.6 mm X 5 pm packing; Supelco Inc., Buchs, Switzerland) preceded by an LC-ABZ guard column (2.0 cm X 4.6 mm X 5 p~ packing, Supelco, Inc.). The LC-SAL column used here is specially designed for SA and is a slightly modified version of the LC-ABZ column used previously (Meuwly and Métraux, 1993). The column was equilibrated with 15% (v/v) acetonitrile. The elution was programmed at 15% acetonitrile for 15 min, increased successively to 16.5% in 3 min, to 25% in 3 min, to 35% in 7.5 min, and to 80% in 5 min and maintained isocratically for 6 min before washing and re-equilibrating at 100 and 15% (v/v) acetonitrile. SA and oANI were quantified fluorimetrically (Spectro- photometer SFM25; Kontron AG, Zurich, Switzerland) with the wavelengths optimized for each compound (Meuwly and h4étraux, 1993). The arrows in Figure 2 indi- cate the change in the emission wavelength from 365 to 407 nm; the excitation wavelength remained at 305 nm during the entire analysis. Radioactive phenolic compounds were monitored with an on-line radioactivity detector with a limit of detection at 0.05 nCi (Berthold AG, Regenstlorf, Switzerland). Under these conditions, standards of 17ara- hydroxybenzoic acid (l), caffeic acid (2), oANI (31, frans- ferulic acid (4), pCou (5), BA (6), oCou (71, cis-CA (8), trans-CA (8), and SA eluted at 8.1, 9.3, 11.4, 14.3, 14.9, 17.9,  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

HPLC Purification and GC-MS ldentification of SA An abundant peak containing material (putative SA) that was both fluorescent and radioactive and that co-eluted with a standard of SA was detected in acid-hydrolyzed extracts of infected leaf discs fed [14C]Phe (Fig. 2, H and I). This material was collected and further purified using C,, reversed-phase HPLC. An acetonitrile/TFA gradient was run as described below at 35°C on a Beckman HPLC system (see above) equipped with a C,, reversed-phase column (ODS, 25 cm X 4.6 mm X 5 pm packing, Supelco, Inc.) preceded by a C,, guard column (2.0 cm X 4.6 mm X 5 PM packing, Supelco, Inc.). The column was equilibrated with a mixture composed of TFA (0.1%) and 20% (v/v) acetoni- trile. Elution was programmed at 1 mL min-l, starting with 20% acetonitrile for 3 min and increasing to 60% in 20 min before washing and re-equilibrating periods at 100 and 20%. Radioactivity and fluorescence (excitation at 305 nm, emission at 407 nm) were monitored. Under these condi- tions, the fluorescent and radioactive material co-eluted with a standard of SA at 15.0 min. The purified material, corresponding to SA, was collected, evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and dissolved in a mixture of 100 pL of methanol and 500 pL of diazomethane in ether. After methylation (3 h, room temperature), samples were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 20 pL of chloroform. Identification of methyl-SA was carried out using a GC-MS computer system model HP MSD 5970 (Hewlett- Packard). Splitless injection of 5 pL was made onto a 25-m X 0.22-mm X 0.25-pm methyl silicone BP5X column (Sci- entific Glass Engineering, Melbourne, Australia). GC con- ditions were: injector 200"C, GC oven held at 100°C for 2 min and programmed at 4"C/min to 290"C, helium carrier at 1 mL/min. MS conditions were: ionization potential 70 eV, ion source 290°C. The retention time of methyl-SA was 7.4 min with a limit of detection of 50 kg in the scanning mode (50-220 atomic mass units). RESULTS Determination of SA and Its Bioprecursors and GC-MS ldentification of SA We used deactivated reversed-phase HPLC separation to obtain optimized separation of SA and its putative precur- sors (Fig. 2, A-C). oANI was used as the interna1 standard to quantify SA as described previously (Meuwly and Mé- traux, 1993). Typical chromatograms of acid-hydrolyzed extracts obtained 6 h after feeding [14C]Phe to leaf discs punched out 48 h after mock and TNV inoculation of cucumber plants are shown in Figure 2, D to H. Fluorescent and radioactive material, co-eluting at 33.5 min with a standard of SA, was more abundant in acid-hydrolyzed extracts of tissues infected with TNV or P.  lachvymans com-  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The material eluting at 33.5 min was collected and further purified by C,, reversed-phase HPLC, where it co-eluted with an authentic standard of SA (data not shown, see "Materials and Methods"). The puri- fied fluorescent and radioactive material was then esteri- fied with diazomethane. Analysis by GC-MS showed that the purified material eluted at the same retention time as the methyl-SA standard (Fig. 3, A-C). The mass spectrum for each sample matched that obtained for the methyl-SA standard with characteristic mass-ion fragments at m/z 152 (Mt), 121,120,93, and 92, thus enabling unambiguous identification of the material as SA in the plants infected with TNV or P. lachrymans (Fig. 3, D-F). The identification of additional peaks containing radio- active substances observed in infected tissue after feeding ['4C]Phe is currently under investigation. However, no radioactivity was detected in the peaks that co-eluted with standards of BA, oCou, and CA (Fig. 2 and spiked extracts, 30- 20 -I 1 O0 F. i'.

Plant Physiol. Vol. 109, 1995 data not shown). The peaks that contained UV-absorbing, fluorescent, and radioactive material, eluting between 12.5 and 15.0 min, and that were strongly induced in plants inoculated with pathogen might correspond to ferulic acid (labeled 4 in Fig. 2) and pCou (labeled 5 in Fig. 2), since we observed 92 and 94% identity with UV spectra standards (220400 nm), respectively. The presence of unlabeled pCou was noi surprising, since this substance (20 ng/pL) was infiltrated together with [I4C]Phe to supplement its endogenous pool. Because no ['4ClSA was detected after feeding [14Clrihe in the absence of pCou (data not shown), its addition was found necessary to drive high amounts of ['4C]Phe toward synthesis of SA rather than through the lignin precursor and phytoalexin routes (Fig. 1). Even un- der these conditions, significant amounts of radioactivity still co-eluted with pCou and ferulic acid (Fig. 2). Phe as a Precursor of SA The involvement of Phe as the direct biosynthetic pre- cursor of SA in cucumber was evaluated 6 h after feeding ['4C]Phe to leaf discs punched out from mock-inoculated or P.  lachrymans-inoculated (24 h) or TNV-inoculated (48 h) plants. Levels of free SA increased from 20 ng/lO discs up to 50 ng/lO discs and levels of bound SA increased from 90 ng/lO discs up to 800 ng/lO discs 48 h after inoculation of the plants with TNV (Fig. 4, A and B). Inoculation with P. lachrymans also induced an increase in bound SA froin 380 ng/lO discs up to 900 ng/lO discs 24 h after treatment, although no difference in free SA was detected compared to controls (Fig. 4, A and B). Accordingly, similar modifi- cations in the levels of [14C]SA were detected in leaf discs punched out from the same mock-inoculated, or TNV- or P. lachrymans-inoculated plants 6 h after vacuum infiltration of ['4C]Phe (Fig. 4, C and D). The ratio of unlabeled SA over labeled [14C]SA was identical for low (controls) and high (infected) levels of SA induction, as indicated by the linear relationships plotted in Figure 4, E (free SA) and F (bound SA). This suggests that a11 of the SA measured after infec- tion is produced from Phe, as in controls, and not from an additional route that could have been specifically incluced in infected tissue. Furthermore, the slopes of the linear regressions were similar for both free and bound SA, sug- gesting that in cucumber the accumulation of de novo synthesized bound SA was due entirely to conjugation of free SA and not to a direct conversion of a putative endo- genous bound form of BA (Fig. 4, E and F). Indeed, no bound [14C]BA was measured in infected cucumber fed ['4C]Phe and [I4C]CA (Fig. 21 and data not shown). CA as a Precursor of SA Because no [I4C]CA was detected in leaf discs fed [14C]Phe (Fig. 2), direct vacuum infiltration of ['"CICA was performed with cucumber leaf discs under the same con- ditions as in the [14ClPhe-feeding experiments described above. Leaf discs of infected plants incorporated minor (0.5% of total radioactivity extracted) but significant amounts of radioactivity into SA (0.45 2 0.21 nCi/lO discs  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Under these conditions more than 50% of total radioactivity ex- tracted was found in peaks co-eluting with standards of ferulic acid and pCou, indicating that uptake of [14C]CA occurred but that label was only weakly directed to SA (data not shown; Meuwly et al., 1993). The fluorescent and radioactive material corresponding to SA was collected and purified and its identity confirmed as SA by GC-MS techniques as described above for the [14C]Phe-feeding experiment (data not shown). PAL lnhibition To elucidate more closely the biosynthesis of SA in in- fected cucumber plants, treatments with a specific inhibitor of PAL, AIP (Zon and Amrhein, 1992), were performed with cucumber leaf discs under the same conditions as in the [14C]Phe experiments described above, except that leaf discs were punched out 22 h after mock or TNV inocula- tion. AIP (50 FM) was vacuum infiltrated together with [14C]Phe, and leaf discs were collected 4 h later. AIP com- pletely blocked the conversion of [I4C]Phe to [l4C1SA in mock- or TNV-inoculated plant material, since no radioac- tivity was detected in total [14C]SA (free and bound) of leaf discs above the limit of detection of 0.05 nCi (two experi- ments, three to five replicates). However, application of 50 WM AIP did not prevent leaf discs of plants inoculated with TNV from efficiently converting [14C]BA to [14C]SA, since the difference in the levels of total [14C]SA with and with- out the PAL inhibitor was not significant (Student's t test, P = 0.61, n = 6, data not shown). Overall, these data suggest a key role for PAL in SA biosynthesis. BA as a Precursor of SA and Systemic lnduction of de Novo SA Synthesis Because no [14C]BA was detected in leaf discs fed [I4C]Phe (Fig. 2), [I4C]BA was either directly vacuum infil- trated into leaf discs from cucumber plants inoculated with TNV or injected into cucumber cotyledons at various times postinoculation with TNV. Leaf discs of plants inoculated with TNV 70 h earlier incorporated more [14C]BA into ['*C]SA than mock-inocu- lated controls (Fig. 5A). Using another tissue and an alter- native method of feeding [l4C1BA, we observed that coty- ledons infected with TNV incorporated more [l4C1BA into [14C]SA than controls (Fig. 6). However, the incorporation of [14C]BA into [14C]SA exhibited a transient pattern, with the highest induction occurring 72 h postinfection with TNV (Fig. 6). It is interesting that leaf discs from leaf 2 of cucumber plants inoculated with TNV on leaf 1 70 h earlier incorpo- rated more [14C]BA into [14C]SA during a 4-h labeling period than mock-inoculated controls (Fig. 58). This means that de novo synthesis of SA was induced not only locally in leaf 1 (Fig. 5A) but also systemically in leaf 2 (Fig. 5B) at a remote distance from the TNV inoculation. Figure 5.

DlSCUSSlON In this study, we examined the biochemical steps leading to the accumulation of 5A in infected cucumber plants, which are frequently used in studies of SAR and which are able to rapidly produce high levels of SA upon pathogen infection. After plants are inoculated with virus (TNV) and bacteria (P. lachrymans), high amounts of [l4C1SA were measured after feeding ['4C]Phe to leaf discs of infected plants (Fig. 4, A-D). The identity of SA was confirmed by a GC-MS technique using a fraction purified by HPLC from acid-hydrolyzed extracts of infected cucumber plants (Fig. 3). More than 80% of the bound SA in cucumber was cleaved by a P-glucosidase (P. Meuwly, M. Crausaz, A. Buchala, and J.-P. Métraux, unpublished data), suggesting the presence of an SA O-glucoside, as shown in tobacco (Enyedi et al., 1992; Malamy et al., 1992; Enyedi and Raskin, 1993; Hennig et al., 1993). Although [14C]Phe was clearly demonstrated to be a precursor of SA in cucumber inoculated with pathogens (Fig. 4), we were unable to detect any radioactivity in peaks co-eluting with the putative intermediates CA, BA, and oCou (Fig. 2). Therefore, leaf discs of cucumber plants inoculated with TNV or P. lachrymnns were fed [14CICA. The discs from infected plants incorporated minor but significant amounts of ['4ClCA into [l4C1SA, whereas mock-inoculated controls did not contain any radioactivity co-eluting with SA. Here, too, no radioactivity was de- tected in peaks associated with standards of the putative intermediates BA and oCou after feeding [l4C1CA, but most of the radioactivity co-eluted with standards of ferulic acid and pCou. A rapid turnover of the biosynthetic inter- mediates of SA, namely CA and BA, is therefore postulated to occur in infected cucumber plants. By comparison, no measurements of biosynthetic intermediates were reported for TMV-infected tobacco seedlings, whereas uninfected cell cultures of tobacco synthesized both [l4C1BA and [I4CISA upon addition of [14C]CA into the medium (Yal- pani et al., 1993). The cellular locations of PAL at the outer membrane and CA hydroxylases at the inner membrane of vesicles or as a membrane-bound-enzyme complex of cu- cumber (Czichi and Kindl, 1977) might explain our obser- vation that [l4C1Phe is a better precursor of SA than ['4ClCA. Also, severa1 isozymes of PAL exist, and only one of these may be responsible for SA biosynthesis. The incorporation of [14CJBA into [14C]SA in leaves and cotyledons of cucumber was higher after infection with TNV compareci to controls (Figs. 5A and 6). This induction of SA biosynthesis was transient in cucumber infected with TNV (Fig. 6) ,  as observed in tobacco seedlings infected with TMV (Yalpani et al., 1993). The difference in the BA pool between tobacco (almost 0.01% on a fresh weight basis after infection [Yalpani et al., 19931) and cucumber (below the leve1 of detection even after infection [Fig. 1G; Meuwly and Métraux, 19931) might explain our inability to cletect any [14C]BA upon feeding [I4C1Phe and [l4C1CA to cucum- ber leaf discs. Nevertheless, the most likely pathway for the synthesis of SA in cucumber inoculated with pathogens seems to proceed from Phe via CA and BA (see the bold arrows in Fig. 1) as demonstrated in various uninfected plant systems (for review, see Raskin, 1992). Severa1 experimental results support the fact that a11 SA produced in infected cucumber was produced exclusively by this pathway and not by an alternative route that could be induced by the infection such as via isochorismic acid in mycobacteria (Fig. 1). First, the ratios of unlabeled SA over ['4C]SA of free and bound SA after feeding [14CIPhe to cucumber leaf discs were not reduced in infected plant material compared to controls, suggesting the absence of sources of SA other than Phe in infected tissue (Fig. 4, E and F). This is in contrast to the situation in tobacco in which the specific activity of SA produced from [14C]BA was lower in TMV- compared to mock-inoculated plants (Yalpani et al., 1993). Second, when AIP, a specific inhibitor of PAL (Zon and Amrhein, 1992) was used, the incorpora- tion of ['4C]Phe in SA was completely blocked, whereas leaf discs treated with AIP could still produce [14C]SA from [14C]BA. Moreover, the slopes of the regression lines of the amount of SA against the radioactivity in [I4CISA for treated or control plants were similar for both free and bound SA (Fig. 4, E and F). This indicates that the accumu- lation of bound SA in cucumber was entirely due to con- jugation of free SA synthesized de novo unlike the situa- tion in tobacco, in which there is a direct conversion of an endogenous pool of BA conjugate (Yalpani et al., 1993). We conclude that production of SA in infected cucurnber plants occurred from Phe and was most likely due to PAL activity without induction of an additional route such as the hydrolysis of a putative bound form of BA or via zsochorismate (Fig. 1). The activity of PAL seems, thereiore, to be closely involved in the accumulation of SA in infected cucumber plants, in addition to its well-documented role in phytoalexin biosynthesis and lignin formation (Hahlbrock and Scheel, 1989). It ís known that cucumber plants accumulate SA system- ically (Métraux et al., 1990; Rasmussen et al., 1991; Meuwly and Métraux, 1993; Meuwly et al., 1994; Mdlders et al.,  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 9, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Buchala, and J.-P. Métraux, unpublished data). It is interesting that discs from leaf 2 of a plant inoculated with P. lachrymans on leaf 1 incorporated more radioactivity into [l4C1SA than controls upon feeding [14C]BA (Fig. 5B). This suggests the involvement of a systemic signal that would trigger de novo synthesis of SA at a location distant from the primary infection. It is not yet clear whether SA can still fulfill the role of the systemic mobile signal leading to SAR in in- fected cucumber, or alternatively, whether another pri- mary signal is present, as suggested in infected tobacco (Delaney et al., 1994; Vernooij et al., 1994). Increased SA levels measured in leaf 2 expressing SAR might thus result partly from de novo synthesis of SA in addition to a pos- sible transport of SA away from the inoculated leaf 1 (Métraux et al., 1990; W. Molders, P. Meuwly, and J.-P. Métraux, unpublished data). ACKNOWLEDCMENTS The authors are grateful to Dr. N. Amrhein (Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Ziirich, Switzerland) and to Dr. L.
