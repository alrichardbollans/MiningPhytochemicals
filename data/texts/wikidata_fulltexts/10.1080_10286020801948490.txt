Garcinia mangostana: a source of potential anti-cancer lead compounds against CEM-
SS cell line 
 
ABSTRACT 
Our current interest in searching for natural anti-cancer lead compounds from plants has led 
us to the discovery that the stem and roots of Garcinia mangostana can be a source of such 
compounds. The stem furnished 2,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-5-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-xanthone 
(1), which is a new xanthone. Meanwhile, the root bark of the plant furnished six xanthones, 
namely -mangostin (2), β-mangostin (3), γ-mangostin (4), garcinone D (5), mangostanol (6), 
and gartanin (7). The hexane and chloroform extracts of the root bark of G. mangostana as 
well as the hexane extract of the stem bark were found to be active against the CEM-SS cell 
line. γ-Mangostin (4) showed good activity with a very low IC50 value of 4.7 μg/ml, while -
mangostin (2), mangostanol (6), and garcinone D (5) showed significant activities with IC50 
values of 5.5, 9.6, and 3.2 μg/ml, respectively. This is the first report on the cytotoxicity of 
the extracts of the stem and root bark of G. mangostana and of -mangostin, mangostanol, and 
garcinone D against the CEM-SS cell line.
