There are several data in the literature indicating a great variety of pharmacological activities of
Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), which exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-human immunodeficiency vi-
rus, anti-bacteria, antioxidant effects and nematocidal activities. Curcumin is a major component in
Curcuma longa L., being responsible for its biological actions. Other extracts of this plant has been
showing potency too. In vitro, curcumin exhibits anti-parasitic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and
gastrointestinal effects; and also inhibits carcinogenesis and cancer growth. In vivo, there are experi-
ments showing the anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory potency of curcumin and extracts of  C. longa L. by
parenteral and oral application in animal models. In this present work we make an overview of the
pharmacological activities of  C. longa L., showing its importance.
Key words: Curcuma longa L. - curcumin - medicinal plants
MEDICINAL PLANTS
The use of medicinal plants for the treatment
of many diseases is associated to folk medicine
from different parts of the world. Natural products
from some plants, fungi, bacterias and other or-
ganisms, continue to be used in pharmaceutical
preparations either as pure compounds or as ex-
tracts. There is a great variety of compounds that
can be extracted and characterized from plants. One
good example is the harmaline, one of the indole
alkaloids found in Peganum harmala (Zygo-
phyllaceae), used in the treatment of dermatosis
(Iwu et al. 1994). Another substance that can be
found in plants is the morphine from the opium
poppy, which has highly analgesic action and is
still used. Its molecule is used as a model for de-
sign to reach new drugs (Phillipson 1994). The iso-
lation of artemisinin showed the real importance
to investigate plants that can be sources of new
compounds with clinical activities. Based on these
facts, we can conclude that plants produce a large
number of substances, which can provide a wide
spectrum of biological properties.
The idea of this article is to invite researchers
to investigate new curcuminoid derivatives with

chemical modifications based in structure and bio-
logical activity relationships, in order to find new
drugs that can be less toxic to humans and also can
be used for the treatment of many diseases.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Curcuma longa L., which belongs to the
Zingiberaceae family, is a perennial herb that mea-
sures up to 1 m high with a short stem, distributed
throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the
world, being widely cultivated in Asiatic countries,
mainly in India and China. In India is popularly
known as “Haldi”, in Malaysia, Indonesia and In-
dia has been well studied due to its economic im-
portance. Its rhizomes are oblong, ovate, pyriform,
often short-branched and they are a household rem-
edy in Nepal (Eigner & Scholz 1999). As a pow-
der, called turmeric, it has been in continuous use
for its flavoring, as a spice in both vegetarian and
non-vegetarian food preparations and it also has
digestive properties (Govindarajan 1980). Current
traditional Indian medicine claims the use of its
powder against biliary disorders, anorexia, coryza,
cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorder, rheuma-
tism and sinusitis (Ammon et al. 1992).
The coloring principle of turmeric was isolated
in the 19th century and was named curcumin, which
was extracted from the rhizomes of C. longa L.,
with yellow color and is the major component of
this plant, being responsible for the anti-inflam-
matory effects. In old Hindu medicine, is exten-
sively used for the treatment of sprains and swell-
ings caused by injury (Ammon & Wahl 1991). The
traditional medicine in China uses C. longa L. in
diseases, which are associated with abdominal
pains. Religious ceremonies still use turmeric in
many forms.

CHEMISTRY
The major constituent, curcumin (difer-
uloylmethane) is in the most important fraction of
C. longa L. and its chemical structure (Figure and
Table), was determined by Roughley and Whiting
(1973). It melts at 176-177°C and forms red-brown
salts with alkalis. Curcumin is soluble in ethanol,
alkalis, ketone, acetic acid and chloroform; and is
insoluble in water. In the molecule of curcumin,
the main chain is aliphatic, unsaturated and the aryl
group can be substituted or not.
phase of inflammation; and acute models, where
acute effects of anti-inflammatory agents can be
studied, testing their inhibitory action on the de-
velopment of rat paw edema.
Mukophadhyay et al. (1982) demonstrated the
activity of curcumin and other semi-synthetic ana-
logues (sodium curcuminate, diacetyl curcumin,
triethyl curcumin and tetrahydro curcumin) in car-
rageenin-induced rat paw edema and cotton pellet
granuloma models of inflammation in rats. In these
experiments the authors used ferulic acid and phe-
nylbutazone (reference drug). Curcumin and its
analogues showed similar action in carrageenin-
induced paw edema in rats; however the sodium
curcuminate was the most potent analogue and was
more water-soluble than curcumin. Among the
curcumin analogues, triethyl curcumin was the
most potent anti-inflammatory in the chronic model
of inflammation, when compared with the others
and with the drug reference; and tetrahydro
curcumin showed no activity. In the acute inflam-
mation condition, all the substances were more
effective. The authors concluded that the activity
of the compounds used in these experiments, would
depend on the model of inflammation. Arora et al.
(1971) investigated the anti-inflammatory activity
in different fractions of the petroleum ether extract
of the rhizomes of turmeric (two constituents) in
animals. They found that the extracts reduced the
granuloma growth and no toxic effects were ob-

ACTIVITIES OF CURCUMA LONGA L.
Anti-inflammatory activity - There is a great
number of papers in the literature relating the ac-
tivity of compounds extracted from C. longa L.
being potent inhibitors of inflammation. These
substances can be classified as curcuminoids, ana-
logues of diarylheptanoids. There are two models
of inflammation to be studied: chronic models (cot-
ton pellet and granuloma pouch), where the inflam-
mation and granulomas develop during a period
of time (several days), indicating the proliferative

served. Chandra and Gupta (1972) demonstrated
the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic actions of
volatile oil of C. longa L. Ghatak and Basu (1972)
showed the action of sodium curcuminate as an
anti-inflammatory agent, being better than
curcumin and hydrocortisone acetate, in experi-
mental inflammation induced by carrageenin and
formalin in albino rats (ED50 = 144 µg/kg), its more
soluble in water than curcumin and no side effects
were observed.
Pharmacological actions of curcumin as an anti-
inflammatory agent have been examined by Srimal
and Dhawan (1973). In this work, the authors re-
ported that the compound was effective in acute as
well as chronic models of inflammation. The po-
tency of this drug is approximately equal to phe-
nylbutazone in the carrageenin-induced edema test,
but it is only half as active in the chronic experi-
ments. It was observed that curcumin was less toxic
than the reference drug (no mortality up to a dose
of 2 g kg-1). Huang et al. (1992) examined the in-
hibitory effects of curcumin on the proliferation
of blood mononuclear cells and vascular smooth
muscle cells. In blood mononuclear cells, curcumin
was capable to impair the response of cells to mi-
togen, PHA and the response to alloantigen, MLR.
The investigators suggested that curcumin could
be use clinically in transplant atherosclerosis. The
cinnamic acid derivatives were less active than
curcumin. Ammon et al. (1992) demonstrated
curcumin as an inhibitor of leucotriene formation
in rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear neutrophils
(PMNL), with an EC50 of 27 x 10-7 M, in contrast,
the hydrocortisone did not show any effect.
Antioxidant activity - Unnikrishnan and Rao
(1995) studied the antioxidative properties of
curcumin and its three derivatives (demethoxy
curcumin, bisdemethoxy curcumin and diacethyl
curcumin). The authors demonstrated that these
substances provide a protection of hemoglobin
from oxidation at a concentration as low as 0.08
mM, except the diacethyl curcumin which has little
effect in the inhibition of nitrite induced oxidation
of hemoglobin.
The effect of curcumin on lipid peroxidation
has also been studied in various models by several
authors. Curcumin is a good antioxidant and in-
hibits lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes,
erythrocyte membranes and brain homogenates
(Pulla Reddy & Lokesh 1994). The lipid
peroxidation has a main role in the inflammation,
in heart diseases, and in cancer.
Turmeric can lower lipid peroxidation by main-
taining the activities of antioxidant enzymes like
superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione
peroxidase at higher levels. These enzymes play
an important role in the regulation of lipid
peroxidation (Pulla Reddy & Lokesh 1992). Pulla
Reddy and Lokesh (1992) observed that curcumin
is capable of scavenging oxygen free radicals such
as superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals, which
are important to the initiation of lipid peroxidation.
Another article about curcuminoids as potent in-
hibitors of lipid peroxidation was described by
Sreejayan Rao (1994), in which the authors showed
that three curcuminoids were inhibitors of lipid
peroxidation in rat brain homogenates and rat liver
microsomes. All of these compounds were more
active than α-Tocopherol (drug reference) and
curcumin showed the better results. In the case of
curcumin, the methoxy group seems to play a ma-
jor role. The phenolic and the methoxy group on
the phenyl ring and the 1,3 – diketone system seems
to be important structural features that can con-
tribute to these effects. The diketone system is a
potent ligand for metals such as iron, used in these
experiments. Another fact proposed in the litera-
ture is that the antioxidant activity increases when
the phenolic group with a methoxy is at the ortho
position. The mechanism of action of curcumin is
still unknown.
Anti-protozoal activity - The first work to re-
late the activity of curcumin and some semi-syn-
thetic derivatives in the literature against
tripanosomatids was studied in promastigotes (ex-
tracellular) and amastigotes (intracellular) forms
of Leishmania amazonensis. The authors showed
that curcumin (a phenolic curcuminoid) in experi-
ments in vitro has an excellent activity (LD50 = 24
µM or 9 mg/ml) and the semi-synthetic derivative,
methylcurcumin (a non-phenolic curcuminoid), has
the best action with a LD50 < 5 µg/ml and LD90 =
35 µM against promastigotes forms. This deriva-
tive was tested in vivo in mice and showed a good
activity with 65.5% of inhibition of the lesion size
of the footpad of the animals, when compared with
the group inoculated with the parasites alone
(Araújo et al. 1998, 1999). Another interesting
point mentioned by the authors is that they did not
observe any inflammatory reaction in the area
where the drugs were injected, perhaps because
curcuminoids are potent inhibitors of inflamma-
tion. Rasmussen et al. (2000) reported the efficacy
of an ethanolic extract from C. longa against Plas-
modium falciparum and L. major, which was able
to inhibit the in vitro growth of these parasites.
Nematocidal activity - Curcuma oil was stud-
ied on Paramecium caudatum in different concen-
trations, varying from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000. The
ciliates became sluggish and ultimately died
(Chopra et al. 1941). Kiuchi et al. (1993) demon-
strated the activity of fractions (methanolic and
chloroformic) of turmeric against Toxocara canis.
In this work they isolated a new curcuminoid, the
726 C. longa L. Biological Activities  CAC Araœjo, LL Leon
cyclocurcumin. All the substances did not show
activity when applied independently, but the ac-
tivity was observed when they were mixed, sug-
gesting a synergistic action between them.
Anti-bacterial activity - Curcuma oil was tested
against cultures of Staphylococcus albus, S.  aureus
and Bacillus typhosus, inhibiting the growth of S.
albus and S. aureus in concentrations up to 1 to
5,000 (Chopra et al. 1941).
Bhavani Shankar and Murthy (1979) investi-
gated the activity of turmeric fractions against some
intestinal bacteria in vitro. In this work, total inhi-
bition of growth of Lactobacilli in the presence of
whole turmeric was observed (4.5-90 µl/100 ml).
The other fraction, the alcoholic extract, was ef-
fective too (10-200 mg/ml), but the inhibition was
not equal as the whole turmeric. Curcumin (2.5-
50 mg/ml) only inhibited S. aureus.
Antivenom activity - A potent antivenom was
tested against snakebite. The fraction consisting of
ar-turmerone, isolated from C. longa L., neutral-
ized both the hemorrhagic activity and lethal ef-
fect of venom in mice. In this study ar-turmerone
was capable of abolishing the hemorrhagic activ-
ity of Bothrops venom and about 70% of the lethal
effect of Crotalus venom. Ar-turmerone can act as
an enzymatic inhibitor in the case of venom en-
zymes, with proteolytic and hemorrhagic activi-
ties (Ferreira et al. 1992).
Anti-HIV - Mazumber et al. (1995) demon-
strated that curcumin has an antiviral activity, be-
ing a HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (IC50 = 40 µM)
and suggested that curcumin analogs may be de-
veloped as anti-Aids drugs. Data showed that
curcumin inhibited the replication of HIV-1
integrase protein. Eigner and Scholz (1999) re-
ported that curcumin was claimed for anti-HIV-1
and HIV-2 activities in a recent patent application.
Anti-tumor activity - Huang et al. (1988), study-
ing the effect of curcumin, chlorogenic acid, caf-
feic acid and ferulic acid on tumor promotion in
mouse skin by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate
(TPA), observed that all these compounds inhibit
the epidermal ornithine decarboxilase (ODC) and
epidermal DNA synthesis, being curcumin the most
efficient. In another work (1991), the results sug-
gested that curcumin was a potent inhibitor of TPA-
and arachidonic acid-induced inflammation and of
lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activities in
mouse epidermis. The IC50 for curcumin-depen-
dent inhibition of these enzyme activities was 5-
10 µM. In this study the results indicated that
curcumin inhibited the epidermal metabolism of
arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase and
cyclooxygenase pathways.
Furthermore, Ozaki et al. (2000), examining the
action of curcumin on rabbit osteoclast apoptosis,
demonstrated that curcumin drastically inhibits
bone resorption in parallel with its stimulation of
apoptosis in the cells. Since cancer and bone in-
flammation are diseases that increase bone resorp-
tion, the authors suggest that curcumin may be
useful in the therapy of these pathogenies.
Other activities - Curcumin and its sodium salt
have been showing a strong anti-inflammatory ac-
tivity in carragenin and caoline-induced edema.
Turmeric powder protects the gastric mucosa
against irritants. Curcumin can decrease high cho-
lesterol levels like statine and have antimutagenic
activity (Scartezzini & Speroni 2000). Chuang et
al. (2000) showed that curcumin at concentrations
of 200 mg/kg or 600 mg/kg could effectively in-
hibit diethylnitrosamine-induced liver inflamma-
tion in rats. Other interesting action of this sub-
stance was demonstrated by Park et al. (2000),
when acute hepatotoxicity was induced by intrap-
eritoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride in rats.
After these animals had been treated with curcumin
and the results showed that the liver injury was
inhibited.
STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS
It is known that curcumin, which can be ex-
tracted from C. longa L., belongs to the class
of curcuminoids and is very similar to
diarylheptanoids. In the literature we can find some
authors that associate the anti-inflammatory activ-
ity of curcumin and its derivatives to the presence
of hydroxyl and phenol groups in the molecule,
being essential for the inhibition of prostaglandins
(PG synthetase) and leucotrienes (LT) (Kiuchi et
al. 1982, 1992, Iwakami et al. 1986). On the other
hand, some authors suggested that the anti-inflam-
matory action is associated to the existence of the
β-dicarbonylic system, which has the conjugated
double bonds (dienes), being responsible for this
activity (Claeson et al. 1993, 1996). This system
seems to be responsible not only for anti-inflam-
matory power, but also to antiparasitic activity
(Araújo et al. 1998, 1999). The presence of diene
ketone system provides a lipophylicity to the com-
pounds, and thus probably better skin penetration.
Other factors can be mentioned here, like the pres-
ence of double bonds (α, β unsaturated system),
which seems to increase the potency of some sub-
stances.
PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES
Experiments involving rats, administrating
curcumin orally were made by Wahlström and
Blennow (1978). They demonstrated that this com-
pound in a dose of 1 to 5 g/kg given to rats appar-
ently did not cause any adverse effect and it was
excreted in the faeces in about 75%, while traces
727Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Vol. 96(5), July 2001
appeared in the urine. Curcumin (up to 5 µg/ml)
added to microsomes suspensions disappeared
within 30 min and it was similar in hepatocyte sus-
pensions. It was capable of disappearing from the
blood after intravenous or after addition to the liver
perfusion system. It seems that curcumin is rap-
idly metabolized in circulation (Whalstöm &
Blennow 1978). Little is known about the path-
way of curcumin and its derivatives. It is neces-
sary to study more about it.
CLINICAL STUDIES
There are data in the literature showing the ad-
ministration of C. longa L. powder in different
patients with respiratory diseases and it was ob-
served that these treated patients have relief in
symptoms like dyspnoea, cough and sputum or
physical signs. Other authors reported the treatment
of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found
a real improvement on them, treated with 120 mg/
day of the drug, administered orally in patients
(Ammon & Wahl 1991).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Based in the literature already described in this
review, we can say that many works have been
done trying to find compounds with low side ef-
fects and pharmacologically activities. The phy-
tochemical seems to be a potential source, having
different substances to be investigated, including
alkaloids, curcuminoids, terpenoids, flavonoids,
etc, which have been commonly used in folk medi-
cine and have efficacy against many diseases. The
herbal preparations used in India traditional medi-
cine can be important to understand their use in
the past as well as nowadays. Knowing that plants
have a large number of chemical substances, which
have several pharmacological actions, we should
exploit more natural products, which in the future
could show the cure for many illnesses. Finally,
we hope that phytotherapies in official health care
signal a new cycle of natural products research.
