IntroductionForest species’ produce large amounts of non-wood forestproducts (NWFPs) in which bioactive substances are present inhigh percentages. These compounds can be transported to theground by exudation from roots or leaching of the aerial parts. Theincreased forest area is not only a source of wood as forestrysystems provide an excellent opportunity to explore the propertiesof these species in the control of weeds, insects and nematodes orfor the improvement of grounds and as a source of bioactiveproducts in Pharmacology.Tectona grandis L.f. (teak) is a native tree from tropical countriesof Asia. Teak wood is one of the most valuable and better knownwoods and it has a large number of applications in the timberindustry due to its beautiful surface and its resistance to termiteand fungal damage (Sumthong et al., 2008). Research on this planthas led to interest in terms of Allelopathy because teak has beensuccessfully used in agroforestry systems (system taungya) and incrop rotation in India, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Cuba (Raets, 1965;Betancourt, 1983; Mishra and Prasad, 1980; Wiersum, 1982).Furthermore, phytotoxic effects on maize, bean, mountain rice andpeanut have been reported (Jayakumar et al., 1987; Krishna et al.,2003).In order to study the potential use of this species as a sourceof natural herbicide models and/or bioactive compounds, we* Corresponding author.E-mail address: famacias@uca.es (F.A.

Published bydoi:10.1016/j.phytol.2012.03.008continued our systematic allelopathic and phytochemical studieson leaves from teak (NWFPs). Previously, we reported the isolationof apocarotenoids, terpenoids and quinones from bioactiveextracts of leaves of T. grandis (Macı́as et al., 2008, 2010; Lacretet al., 2011). As a continuation of this research, we report here theisolation and structure elucidation of two new norlignans and tenknown compounds (six lignans and four phenolic compounds),which are shown in Fig. 1. The general bioactivities of the isolatedcompounds were studied using etiolated wheat coleoptile.Norlignans are found mainly in conifers, monocotyledons and afew species of dicotyledons (Chang et al., 1997; Kawazoe et al.,1999; Ning et al., 2005; D’Abrosca et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010;Mohamed et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). This is the first time thatlignans and norlignans have been isolated from T. grandis.2. Results and discussionThe study of the allelopathic potential of T. grandis and itspossible use as a source of natural herbicide models was initiatedwith the phytochemical study of (i) the DCM/H2O extract obtainedfrom the aqueous extract and (ii) the DCM extract obtained bydirect maceration of the dry leaves. Both extracts were selected onthe basis of the bioactivity levels shown in the wheat coleoptilebioassay (Macı́as et al., 2008).The chromatographic study of the DCM/H2O active extractallowed us to isolate four phenolic compounds (1–4) and eightlignans (5–12) (Fig. 1). The spectroscopic data of 1–10 wereidentical to those previously reported for acetovanillone (1)(Knapp et al., 1972), E-isofuraldehyde (2) (Macı́as et al., 2004), Elsevier B.V.

All of these compounds wereisolated for the first time from T. grandis. Compounds 11 and 12 arealso described for the first time in the literature.2.1. Tectonoelin A (11)11 was isolated from the DCM/H2O extract as a brown oil. Themolecular formula was determined to be C18H16O6 from themolecular ion peak at m/z 328.0948 (calc. 328.0947) in the HR-EIMS. The IR absorptions at 3429, 1735, and 1607 cm1 indicatedthe presence of hydroxyl groups, ester group and double bonds,respectively.The 1H NMR spectrum contained signals for one aromaticmethoxy group at d 3.85 (3H, s) and six aromatic protons as twogroups of signals. The first group of signals was at d 6.77 (1H, d,J = 8.0 Hz, H-50), d 6.78 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-20) and d 6.68 (1H, dd,J = 8.0 Hz, J = 2.0 Hz, H-60) and the second group was at d 6.87 (1H,d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5), d 7.06 (1H, bs, H-2) and d 7.04 (1H, dd, J = 8.0 Hz,J = 2.0 Hz, H-6), indicating the presence of two 1,3,4-trisubstitutedbenzenic rings.Other signals were assigned to one methylene at d 3.07 (1H, ddd,J = 17.6 Hz, J = 8.4 Hz, J = 3.0 Hz, H-80a) and d 3.62 (1H, ddd,J = 17.6 Hz, J = 8.4 Hz, J = 3.0 Hz, H-80b) and one methine at d5.48 (1H, dd, J = 8.4 Hz, J = 6.0 Hz, H-70) bonded to oxygen.Additionally, a signal was observed for a downfield olefinic protonat d 7.45 (1H, t, J = 3.0 Hz, H-7), suggesting the presence of atrisubstituted double bond attached to an electron withdrawinggroup.The 1H NMR-2D-COSY spectrum of 11 showed the presence ofthe fragment –CH5C–CH2–CH–(O)–. Thus, the geminal systemthat gave signals at d 3.07 (H-80a) and d 3.62 (H-80b) showed acoupling with the signals at d 7.45 (H-7) and d 5.48 (H-70).All of the signals and their correlations suggested the presenceof a nor-7-ene-lignan-9,70-lactone. This proposal was furthersupported by the similarity of the spectroscopic data to thosereported for other analogous compounds (D’Abrosca et al., 2006).The 13C NMR spectrum contained 18 signals as follows: 1methyl, 1 methylene, 8 methines and 8 quaternary carbons,according to an HSQC experiment. Twelve of these signals weredue to aromatic carbons that belonged to the two 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzenic rings. Three signals were due to sp2carbons, with the two at d 122.8 and 138.4 belonging to the doublebond. The last signal, at d 174.9, was consistent with the presenceof a carbonyl group.The HMBC experiment confirmed the presence of a g-lactone,with correlations observed between H-70 (d 5.48), H-80a (d 3.07)and H-80b (d 3.62) with C-9 (d 174.9) as well as H-7 (d 7.45) with C-80 (d 37.2), C-1 (d 127.9), C-2 (d 114.6), C-3 (d 149.1) and C-8 (d122.5) (Fig. 2).The stereochemistry of the double bond at C-7 and C-8 wasdeduced from the NOE effects observed on irradiation of H-80a andH-80b with H-7 and H-70. The relative position of the rings wasconfirmed by NOE effects between protons H-80 (2H) and H-20, H-50and H-60. Compound 11 was therefore (7Z)-90nor-30,4,40-trihy-droxy-3-methoxylign-7-ene-9,70-lactone. This compound has notbeen described previously in the literature and we have named thiscompound tectonoelin A.Fig. 2.

Bioactivities obtained in the etiolated wheat coleoptile bioassay.R. Lacret et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 5 (2012) 382–3863842.2. Tectonoelin B (12)12 was obtained from the DCM/H2O extract as a brown oil. Themolecular formula was determined to be C19H18O7 from themolecular ion peak at m/z 358.1053 (calc. 358.1053) in the HR-EIMS. The IR absorptions at 3438, 1727 and 1626 cm1 indicatedagain the presence of the same functional groups, hydroxyl, esterand double bonds.The 1H NMR spectrum of 12 was very similar to that oftectonoelin A (11), which would indicate that it was a derivative oftectonoelin A. The most significant difference between the twospectra was the chemical shift and multiplicity of the signals due toprotons on one of the rings (d 6.78, 2H, s, H-2, H-6 and d 3.83, s,2  OCH3). The data suggested that these two compounds differ inthe presence of one extra methoxyl group in 12, which must belocated at C-5. The correlation observed in the g-HMBC experimentbetween the methoxyl groups at d 3.83 (6H, s) and the signals at d108.9 and d 149.3 confirmed the positions of methoxyl groups at C-3 and C-5. On the other hand, the NOE effect between H-7 and H-80confirmed a Z stereochemistry for the double bond.On the basis of these data the structure suggested for thiscompound was (7Z)-90nor-30,4,40-trihydroxy-3,5-dimethoxylign-7-ene-9,70-lactone, as shown in Fig. 1. An isomer isolated fromCestrum parqui has been described in the literature, i.e. 13(D’Abrosca et al., 2006). The differences observed between thespectroscopic data of compound 12 and its isomer 13 suggestedthat the stereochemistry of the double bond of these compoundsshould be different [13C NMR spectrum, d: 129.2 (C-1), 109.5 (C-2),133.6 (C-4), 133.6 (C-8), 123.3 (C-10), 81.1 (C-70)], as shown inFig. 1. This is the first time that compound 12 has been isolated andwe have named it tectonoelin B.Norlignans are unusual compounds and most of them havebeen found in the heartwood of coniferous trees (Castro et al.,1996). Compounds 11 and 12 can be included in the group with aC8–C80 linkage type, which is particularly rare (Suzuki andUmezawa, 2007). This kind of compound has been obtained fromconifers (Erdtman and Harmatha, 1979; D’Abrosca et al., 2006).However, this is the first time that compounds of this type (C8–C80linkage norlignans) have been isolated from a dicotyledon –although teak is a timber tree – and, more importantly, from theleaves, which is in full even more uncommon.2.3. Bioassay resultsEtiolated wheat coleoptiles bioassay is a rapid test that issensitive to a wide range of bioactive substances (Cutler et al.,2000; Cutler, 1984; Jacyno and Cutler, 1993). Twelve compoundswere isolated from T. grandis and, as dictated by the availablequantities of these compounds, the bioactivities of the C6C2phenolic 1, four known lignans (5, 6, 8 and 9) and tectonoelins(11 and 12) were evaluated (Fig. 3). The highest concentrationtested was 103 M. The results obtained showed that compounds5, 6, 8 and 11 have good levels of activity. The most activecompound was 8, which gives values of around 85% at 103 M.Compounds 5, 6 and 11 showed inhibition effects of between 70and 60% at the highest concentration. The activities observedfor 5 and 8 were consistent with those previously reported forthese compounds (Macı́as et al., 2004). Compounds 5 and 6 havea tetrahydrofurofuranic skeleton and the only structural differ-ence is the presence of an additional methoxyl group. Thisdifference has very little influence on the bioactivity observed. Inthe case of the new compounds, tectonoelins A (11) and B (12),which have a norlignan skeleton, the presence of an additionalmethoxyl group in 12 seems to decrease the bioactivity levels incomparison with 11.These activities show that the isolated lignans and norlignansshould form part of the defence mechanism of this plant andcontribute to the success of this species in a variety ofagroecosystems.3. Experimental3.1. GeneralIR spectra (KBr) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IRSpectrum 1000 or a Mattson 5020 spectrophotometer. NMRspectra were run on Varian INOVA 400 and Varian INOVA 600spectrometers. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect toresidual 1H signals of CHCl3-d1 and methanol-d4 (d 7.25 and 3.30,respectively), and 13C signals are referenced to the solvent signal (d77.00 and 49.00, respectively). Optical rotations were determinedusing a Perkin-Elmer model 241 polarimeter (on the sodium Dline). HRMS were obtained on a VG AUTOESPEC mass spectrometer(70 eV). HPLC was carried out on a Merck-Hitachi instrument withRI detection, using three different Merck LiChrospher columns: RP-18 (10 mm, 250 mm  10 mm), RP-18 (5 mm, 250 mm  4 mm) SI60 (5 mm, 250 mm  4 mm) and SI 60 (10 mm, 250 mm  10 mm).3.2.

Details of the extraction procedure and the bioassayson the extract have been described previously (Macı́as et al., 2008).The DCM/H2O extract (8.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel(160 g) using hexane/ethyl acetate mixtures of increasing polarity,acetone and methanol to yield twelve fractions: A1–L1.Fraction E1 (0.750 g, hexane/ethyl acetate, 17:3–4:1) wassubjected to CC on Sephadex LH-20 using n-hexane/chloroform/methanol (3:1:1) to afford 11 fractions (E11–E111). Fraction E15(72 mg) was separated by CC on silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetatemixtures to yield compound 1 (2.0 mg). Fraction E17 (54 mg) waspurified by C-18 HPLC (water/methanol, 1:1) to yield 2 (1.0 mg).Fraction H1 (0.734 g, hexane/EtOAc, 3:2–2:3) was subjected toCC on Sephadex LH-20 using n-hexane/chloroform/methanol(3:1:1) to yield compound 11 (60 mg).Fraction I1 (0.719 g, hexane/EtOAc, 1:4) was subjected to CC onsilica gel using chloroform/acetone mixtures of increasing polarityand methanol to afford ten fractions: I11–I110. Fraction I12(0.055 g) was purified by silica gel HPLC to yield 5 (8.6 mg), 6(5.0 mg) and 10 (2.6 mg). The largest fraction, I16 (0.300 g), waspurified by CC on silica gel using hexane/acetone mixtures to affordten fractions: I16A–I16J. Further purification of fraction I16I(0.058 g) by C-18 HPLC (water/methanol, 9:11) yielded 8(20.0 mg), 9 (8.0 mg) and 4 (3.0 mg). Fraction I16H (0.028 g) waspurified by RP-18 HPLC (water/methanol, 2:3) to yield 9 (5.0 mg)and 7 (3.4 mg). Fraction I17 (0.112 g) was purified using hexane/chloroform/methanol (3:1:1) on Sephadex LH-20 to affordcompound 12 (27.0 mg).Fraction J1 (1.730 g, hexane/EtOAc, 1:4) was subjected to CC onSephadex LH-20 using hexane/chloroform/methanol (3:1:1) toafford four fractions (J11–J14).

Coleoptiles bioassayWheat seed (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Duro) were sown in 15 cmdiameter Petri dishes moistened with water and grown in the darkat 22  1 8C for 3 days (Hancock et al., 1964). The roots and caryopseswere removed from the shoots. The latter were placed in a Van derWeij guillotine and the apical 2 mm were cut off and discarded. Thenext 4 mm of the coleoptiles were removed and used for bioassays. Allmanipulations were performed under a green safelight (Nitsch andNitsch, 1956). Compounds were predissolved in DMSO and diluted tothe final bioassay concentration with a maximum of 0.1% DMSO.Parallel controls were also run.Crude extracts, fractions or pure compounds to be assayed forbiological activity were added to test tubes. Each assay was carriedout in duplicate. Phosphate-citrate buffer (2 ml) containing 2%sucrose (Nitsch and Nitsch, 1956) at pH 5.6 was added to each testtube. Five coleoptiles were placed in each test tube (three tubes perdilution) and the tubes were rotated at 0.25 rpm in a roller tubeapparatus for 24 h at 22 8C in the dark. The coleoptiles weremeasured by digitalization of their images. Data were statisticallyanalyzed using Welch’s test (Martı́n Andrés and Luna del Castillo,1990). Data are presented as percentage differences from control.Thus, zero represents the control; positive values representstimulation of the studied parameter, and negative valuesrepresent inhibition.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia eInnovación, Spain (Project Nos.
