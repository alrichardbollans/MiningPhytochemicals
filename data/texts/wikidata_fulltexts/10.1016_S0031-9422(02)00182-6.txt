IntroductionThe Euphorbiaceae family is one of the largest familiesin the plant kingdom. It comprises 263 genera andabout 7300 species of almost cosmopolitan distribution.Euphorbia, the largest genus of Euphorbiaceae, withabout 1600 species is characterized by the presence ofmilky latex. This genus has been the subject of numerouschemical studies (Singla and Pathak, 1990; Ahmad andJassbi, 1998; Öksüz et al., 1999; Vogg et al., 1999; Ferreiraand Ascenso, 1999; Hohmann et al., 1999, 2000; Marcoet al., 1999).As a part of our programme on the chemistry ofplants of NE of Portugal, we have investigated Euphorbiahyberna L., subsp. hyberna, which is native from theWest and South of Europe. It is a small shrub growingin damp or shady places, mainly on mountains (Mooreet al., 1968). This species is chemically investigated bythe first time. In this study, we report the isolation andstructure elucidation of three hitherto unknown polye-sters of macrocyclic diterpenes with the jathrophane andlathyrane skeletons.2. Results and discussionThe acetone-soluble fraction obtained from thechloroform extract of the roots of E. hyberna L. wassubjected to silica gel column chromatography and elutedwith hexane/chloroform mixtures, giving one jatrophanetetraester 1 and two lathyrane derivatives 2 and 3.The 1H and 13C NMR of compound 1 spectrarevealed the presence of one benzoate group [H 8.04 brd (2H), 7.46 t (2H), 7.60 t (1H); C 129.7, 129.6 (2CH),128.4 (2CH), 133.3 (CH), 165.6 (C=O)] and threeacetate groups [H 2.25, 1.83, 2.06, C 169.1, 168.6, 170.1(C=O) and 21.5, 20.6, 20.5 (CH3)]. The1H NMR andCOSY spectra revealed the presence of two tertiarymethyl groups (H 1.24, 1.43), two secondary methylgroups (H 1.35 d, 6H) and the structural fragments withsequences of correlated protons: H 2.16 m, 3.10 dd, 2.48m and 1.35 d [–CH2–CH(CH3)–]; H 5.45 dd, 2.89 dd,5.90 d [–CH(OR)–CH–CH(OR)–]; H 5.53 d, 5.94 dd,3.54 m, 1.35 d [trans –CH=CH–CH(CH3)]. Addition-ally 13C NMR and DEPT spectra indicated the presenceof two ketones (C-9 and C-14), a double bond with atrans configuration (J=16 Hz, C11=C12), and an exo-methylene group at C-6. The connectivities of thesepartial structures and the ester groups position wereestablished by the long-range C–H correlations found inthe HMBC spectrum of 1 (Table 1).

H-4 was used as a convenientreference point and was assumed to be a (Günther et al.,1998). NOE cross peaks between H-4, H-3 and H-13supported the b orientation of the benzoate group on C-3and the methyl group located on C-13. A NOE corre-lation between H-3 and H-16 pointed to an a orienta-tion of this methyl group. The absence of NOE crosspeaks between H-4 and H-5 required that H-5 have alsoan a orientation. A NOE cross peak between H-5 andH-8, proved the b orientation of H-8 and the a orienta-tion of the 8-OAc. The NOE cross-peaks between H-11and H-13 and H-18, and also between H-12 and H-19and H-20 proved that these two groups of protons havean opposite orientation. No NOE correlation wasobserved between H-4 and 15-OAc, supporting the borientation of the acetyl group on C-15. The couplingbetween H-4 and H-5 (J4,5=10 Hz) suggests that thecompound adopts a conformation in which the 6,17exomethylene group is perpendicular to the mean planof the macrocyclic ring (Jakupovic et al., 1998; Marco etal., 1998). With regard to the above data the structureof compound 1 was established as a derivative of thebicyclic diterpenoid jatrophane (Fig. 1).Compound 2 (Fig. 2) is a 2-epiisomer of a knowncompound, lathyrol diacetate benzoate isolated fromEuphorbia lathyris (Adolf and Hecker, 1971). Its 1H and13C NMR spectra (Table 2) revealed the presence of onebenzoate group [H 8.04 br d (2H), 7.46 t (2H), 7.58 t(1H), C 130.1, 129.6 (2CH), 128.3 (2CH), 133.1Table 1NMR spectral data of the jatrophane 1Atom 1H (J in Hz) 13C 1H–1H COSY HMBC NOESY1a 2.16, m 42.3 t H-1b – H-1b, H-4, H-13, H-161b 3.10, dd (15.9, 9.0) H-1a; H-2 C-2, C-4, C-15 H-1a, H-22 2.48, m 38.4 d H-1a; H-16 – H-1b, H-3, H-163 5.45, dd (5.1, 1.2) 81.2 d H-4 C-1, C-15, C-10 H-2, H-4, H-164 2.89, dd (9.9, 5.4) 46.6 d H-3; H-5 C-5, C-6, C-14 H-1a, H-3, H-135 5.90, d (9.9) 72.6 d H-4 5-COMe H-86 – 137.1 s – – –7 2.16, m 29.7 t H-8 – –8 5.32, br d (7.2) 72.2 d H-7 C-6 H-7, H-12, H-17b, H-199 – 207.8 s – – –10 – 49.5 s – – –11 5.53, d (15.9) 135.2 d H-12 C-10, C-13, C-19, C-18 H-7, H-13, H-1812 5.94, dd (15.9, 9.9) 132.9 d H-11; H-13 C-10, C-20 H-17a, H-19, H-2013 3.54, m 44.7 d H-12; H-20 C-11, C-12, C-20 H-1a, H-4, H-11, H-2014 – 203.6 s – – –15 – 92.7 s – – –16 1.35, d (7.2)a 19.6 qa H-2 C-1, C-2, C-3 H-1a, H-2, H-317a 5.28, br s 117.4 t – C-5, C-6, C-7 H-5, H-17b17b 4.96, br s – H-7 C-7 H-17a18 1.24, s 24.0 q – C-9, C-10, C-11, C-18 H-1119 1.43, s 24.6 q – C-9, C-10, C-11, C-19 H-8, H-1220 1.35, d (6.5)a 19.7 qa H-13 C-12, C-13, C-14 H-12, H-13OAc5-CO – 168.6 s – – –5-COMe 1.83, s 20.6 q – 5-COMe –8-CO – 169.1 s – – –8-COMe 2.25, s 21.5 q – 8-COMe –15-CO – 170.1 s – – –15-COMe 2.06, s 20.5 q – 15-COMe –OBz10 – 165.6 s – – –20 – 129.7 s – – –30, 70 8.04, br d (7.2) 129.6 d H-40,60 C-10, C-50 –40, 60 7.46, t (7.5) 128.4 d H-30,50 C-20 –50 7.60, t (7.5) 133.3 d H-40,60 – –All 1H–13C connectivities were assigned by HETCOR and multiplicities were determined by DEPT experiments.

However, theresonances of H-1b, H-2 and H-3, their multiplicity andthe 13C NMR spectrum are quite different from thoseobserved for similar lathyrol derivatives (Adolf andHecker, 1971; Appendino et al., 1999; Itokawa et al.,1990; Onwukaeme and Rowan, 1992).

The similarity of the resonances and couplingconstants values in the fragment of C-5 to C-13 of 2with those published for lathyrol esters led us to con-clude that the configuracional and conformationalaspects of the 11-membered ring are essentially the samein both systems. The stereochemical differences werecentred on the five membered rings, which were con-firmed by the coupling pattern between H-2 and H-1band the analysis of the NOESY spectrum of compound2 (Table 4). H-4 was again used as a reference point andassumed to be a. A NOE cross peak between H-4 andH-3 proved the b orientation of the benzoate group onC-3, while a NOE cross peak between H-3 and 16-CH3proved the a orientation of the methyl group on C-2and confirmed that compound 2 is a 2-epiisomer of alathyrol ester. The absence of NOE correlation betweenH-4 and H-5 proved the a orientation of the acetategroup on C-5.The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 2) of compound3 (Fig. 2) have a close similarity with those of com-pound 2 and revealed the presence of three acetategroups [H 2.01, 2.02, 2.05, C 170.0, 169.7, 170.7(C=O), 20.9, 21.0, 21.7 (CH3)], two tertiary methylgroups (H 1.25, 1.20), two secondary methyl groups (H1.15 d, 1.73 d), one ketone (C-14), a double bond(C12=C13) with a trans configuration (supported bythe absence of NOE cross-peak between H-12 and 20-CH3 in the NOESY spectrum) and an exomethylenegroup at C-6. The proton and carbon connectivitiesdeduced from HETCOR, HMBC and NOESY experi-ments (Tables 3 and 4) allowed to establish the carbonframework and to assign the position of the acyl residues.All these spectral features of compound 3 and theircomparison with literature data (Adolf and Hecker,1971; Appendino et al., 1999; Itokawa et al., 1990;Onwukaeme and Rowan, 1992) led us to assign itsstructure as depicted in Fig. 2.3.

General1H and 13C NMR (300.13 and 75.47 MHz, respec-tively) and 2D NMR (COSY, NOESY, HETCOR andHMBC) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and referencedto TMS signal (1H) and to solvent signal (13C) on aBruker AMX spectrometer.

Plant materialThe whole root system of E. hyberna L., subsp.hyberna, was collected in the Alvão mountains, nearVila Real (Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, NE ofPortugal) in March 1996. Voucher specimens have beendeposited in the Herbarium of the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro.3.3. Extraction and isolationThe air-dried and powdered roots (634 g) wereextracted exhaustively with chloroform (6  2.5 l), atroom temperature. Removal of the solvent from theorganic extract, at 40 C under reduced pressure, gave aresidue (15.1 g) that was partitioned with acetone. Theacetone-soluble fraction, furnished a yellow oil residue(9.0 g) that was fractionated using silica gel CC (1 kgsilica gel 100 using CHCl3 as eluent) collecting 500 mlfrs. The combined frs. 21–27 (4.0 g) were then subjectedto a second CC (CCII) using 200 g of silica gel 60, elut-ing with EtOAc–n-hexane (2:8) and collecting 100 mlfrs. All the collected frs. were monitored by TLC, andcombined, in accordance with their composition. Solventevaporation of the combined frs. 21–34 (CCII) pre-cipitated pure compound 1 (130 mg, Rf 0.50, EtOAc-CHCl3, 1:9). Frs. 3–7 (1.73 g), which were eluted fromCCII, were chromatographed on a silica gel 60 (60 g)column, using EtOAc–CHCl3 (5:95) as eluent, and gavepure compound 2 (30 mg, Rf 0.60, EtOAc–CHCl3,5:95). Frs. 9–15, obtained from CCII, afforded a residue(0.82 g) that was subjected to repeated CC on silica gel60 (EtOAc–CHCl3 1:9) and gave a residue (0.38 g) thatwas further purified by PTLC (EtOAc–CHCl3 1:9, 2)yielding pure compound 3 (26 mg, Rf 0.56, EtOAc–CHCl3, 1:9).Table 4NOESY correlations of lathyranes 2 and 32 3H-1b: H-1a H-1b: H-1aH-3: H-4, H-16 H-3: H-4, H-17a, H-16H-4: H-3, H-17a H-4: H-3, H-17aH-5: H-12 H-5: H-12H-12: H-5, H-20 H-12: H-5, H-20H-17a: H-4, H-17b H-17a: H-4, H-17bH-17b: H-7a, H-17a H-17b: H-3,a H-4,H-17aH-16: H-2, H-3, H-12 H-16: H-3, H-12H-20: H-5, H-12 H-20: H-5, H-12H-30,70: H-40,60H-50H-40,60: H-30,70H-50H-50: H-40,60a Ambiguous due to the overlapping with diagonal peaks.376 A.M.V.D.
