Abstract--The acetone xtract of the whole plant of Plectranthus grandidentatus provided the already known abietanes royleanone, 6,7-dehydroroyleanone, horminone, 6fl-hydroxyroyleanone, 7a-acetoxy-6fl-hydroxy- royleanone and the abietane dimers grandidone C, grandidone D and 7-epigrandidone D, together with a mixture of fatty acid esters of 7cr-acyloxy-6fl,12-dihydroxy-abieta-8,12-diene-11,14-dione. Some of these compounds showed moderate antibacterial ctivity.
