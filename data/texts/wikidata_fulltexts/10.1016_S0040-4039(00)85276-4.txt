Abstract: The enzyme which transfers the CH3-group of S-adenosylmethionine to the 
nitrogen atom of (S)-tetrahydroberberine and (S)-stylopine is found to occur in a number 
of plant cel l  cultures or ig inat ing from species containing alkaloids; i t  is located at an 
important branch point in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. 
Protopine and benzophenanthridine alkaloids are prominent members of the large group 
of isoquinoline alkaloids in higher plants. Previous work has ver i f ied the incorporation 
of the N-methyl derivatives of canadine and stylopine into both classes of alkaloids [1,2] .  
Takao et a l .  [3] fur ther  demonstrated that only the cis-N-methyl derivatives of tetra-  
hydroprotoberberines can be stereospeci f ical ly  metabolized into the benzophenanthridine 
type and protopine type skeleton. As part of our investigations involving the elucidation 
of reaction sequences in the isoquinoline biosynthesis~ we searched for that enzyme which 
catalyzes the N-methylation of tetrahydroprotoberberines. The enzyme was assayed for  i ts  
cata lyt ic  ac t iv i ty  by using (14CH3)-S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM; 2 nMol) and (R,S)-cana- 
dine (10 nMol) as a substrate at pH 8 (glycine-NaOH buffer) in a tota l  volume of 300 ~l 
containing 50-300 pg protein. The enzyme reaction was followed by monitoring the transfer 
of rad ioact iv i ty  from the aqueous into the isoamyl phase [4] after an incubation period of 
30 min at 40°C. Enzymatically catalyzed methylation of canadine occurred in a number of 
ce l l - f ree  extracts from cel l  suspension cultures of for  instance Berberis stenophylla 
(0.22 pkat/mg protein),  Corydalis vaginans (0.74), Dicentra spectabil is (0.94), Fumaria 
o f f i c ina l i s  (0.43), Papaver somniferum (0.41). The product of the reaction was un- 
equivocally ident i f ied  as N-methyltetrahydroprotoberberine by large scale (500-fold) incu- 
bation (10 h) of the above incubation mixture containing 80 mg protein from C. vaginans. 
The incubation mixture was extracted with ethylacetate, which was chromatographed (TLC) 
and the newly formed compound isolated. MS of the unknown product showed e/z M + at 353 
(5.6%); 339 (19.4%); 176 (27.8%); 174 (30.6%); 164 (100%); 149 (83.5%). The MS was in 
every respect identical  to N-methylcanadine [5].  The enzyme was pur i f ied 40-fold, i t  has a 
molecular weight of 72 000 + 10%, a pH-optimum at 8.0, and a temperature optimum at 40°C. 
The enzyme is specif ic for  (S)-canadine (R I = R 2 = CH3; I00%) and (S)-stylopine (R I + R 2 = 
CH2; 77%); the (R)-enantiomers as well as (S)-scoulerine, (R,S)-tetrahydropalmatine, 
(R,S)-tetrahydrojatrorrhiz ine,  (R,S)-columbamine, (S)-norret icul ine and (S) - ret icu l ine are 
not metabolized. The enzyme therefore acts on tetrahydroprotoberberines of (S)-configur- 
5603 
5604 
ation containing a methylenedioxy bridge at carbon atoms 2 and 3. Feeding experiments of 
N-(14CH3)-stylopine obtained by enzymatic catalysis showed good incorporation into proto- 
pine (0.6%) and sanguinarine (7.7%) in Fumaria capreolata callus cultures. This 
demonstrated that the product formed by the new enzyme is b io logical ly  active. Since Takao 
et al .  [3] have unequivocally demonstrated that only the cis-N-methyl derivatives of tetra-  
hydroprotoberberines can be stereospecif ical ly metabolized into the benzophenanthridine 
and protopine type skeleton - while the trans-N-methyl derivatives are absolutely inactive 
- we can assign the cis-configuration to the enzymatically formed product. The enzyme 
responsible for the formation of this important branch point metabolite is therefore 
termed: S-Adenosyl-L-methionine: (S)-7,8,13,14-tetrahydroberberine-cis-N-methyltrans- 
ferase. The high substrate spec i f i c i ty  of this enzyme is reflected by the fact that the 
vast majority of benzophenanthridine and protopine alkaloids in nature contain methylene- 
dioxy groups biogenetically corresponding to the C 2 and C 3 position of the tetrahydro- 
protoberberine skeleton. Since the methylenedioxy group in berberine biosynthesis is 
formed at the quaternary stage (the substrate being columbamine and not tetrahydrocolumba- 
mine) [6] and since quaternary alkaloids cannot diffuse or be transported across the 
membrane of the specif ic vesicle in which they are formed [7],  the question that remains is 
how (S)-canadine and (S)-stylopine, both acceptors for the methyl group, are formed. There 
are at least two poss ib i l i t ies :  either quaternary protoberberines are stereospecif ical ly 
reduced to thei r  tetrahydro counterparts with (S)-configuration, which serve as substrates 
for the N-methylating enzyme, or (S)-canadine is formed from (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine by
a yet to be discovered methylenedioxy bridge forming enzyme acting on this  substrate 
rather than on the quaternary alkaloid columbamine [6].
