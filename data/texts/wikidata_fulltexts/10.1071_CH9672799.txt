THE OCCURRENCE OF MUSTARD OIL GLUCOSIDES IN  LEPIDIUM HYSSOPIFOLIUM DESV., L. BONARIENSE (L.), AND CAPSELLA B URSA PASTOR18 (L.) MEDIC." The annual crucifers, Lepidium hyssopifolium Desv. and L. bonariense (L.) (pepperwort or peppercress), and Capsella bursa pastoris (L.) ;Medic. (shepherd's purse) are common weeds of farm and pasture in south-east Queensland. These and other cruciferous weeds are frequently grazed by livestock during dry winter months and when ingested can impart objectionable flavours to the milk of dairy cattle, or to chicken and beef flesh.l.2 The incidence of "weed taints" in milk and other dairy produce can be quite severe during unfavourable seasonal conditions and is of considerable economic concern to the dairy industry in Queensland. Little is known of the chemical nature of the substances responsible for these taints, although it is commonly believed that the constituent mustard oil glucosides are in some way implicated.1 Indeed, benzyl thiocyanate, which is a product of an enzymic degradation of glucotropaeolin, the constituent mustard oil glucoside of Coronopus didymus Sm., is known to be a substance responsible for the development of the C, didymus taint in milk.3 Hussong et a1.4 and later Conochie5 reported that the milk of cows ingesting Lepidium spp. had a high content of indole or skatole, which was thought to be responsible for the "faecal" odour present in such milk. We now wish to report the presence of glucotropaeolin in the seed-bearing portions of L. hyssopifolium and L. bonariense and the presence of the mustard oil glucoside sinigrin in C. bursa pastoris. The seeds of L. hyssopifolium were found to contain c. 0 1 % of glucotropaeolin, a yield comparable to those found in other Lepidium spp. examined elsewhere.6 A second mustard oil glucoside, probably sinigrin, was shown to be present in small amount in the seeds of L. bonariense. The occurrence of mustard oil glucosides in the Lepidium spp, examined here suggests that these constituents may contribute to the development of the Lepidium taint in meat and dairy produce in a manner analogous to the Coronopus taint. However, this contrasts to the reports that skatole and/or indole are responsible for the Lepidium taint in milk, and a further study of the role of these glucosides or their breakdown products in the development of the Lepidium taint is warranted. * Manuscript received April 12, 1967. f Queensland Department of Primary Industries, Brisbane, Qld. 4000. 1 Conochie, J., Aust.

Chem., 1967, 20, 2799-801 2800 SHORT COMMUNICATIONS The presence of sinigrin in 0. bursa pastoris is in contrast to the findings of Kjaer et al.7 and Schultz et al.8, but confirms the suggestion of Bodinus.9 The con- centration of sinigrin in C. bursa pastoris as found here is considerably lower than that of mustard oil glucosides in other cruciferous plants, however. This may indicate that the ability of this plant to impart off-flavours to the milk of grazing dairy cattle is lower than in other crucifers, in agreement with the observations of Conochie and others.1 Experimental Analyses are by Mr J. Kriauciunas, University of Queensland. Melting points are corrected. Infrared spectra were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 21 instrument with sodium chloride optics. The "semi-micro" still contains 20 om of packing as described by Bower and Cookel0 and has a stillhead designed to minimize hold-up. Gas chromatography was carried out on a column, 4 f t  by 4 in., with 20% of Apiezon M on Gas Chrom. P support, operated a t  170'; a hydrogen flame temperature detector was used. (a) L. hyssopifolium The seed-bearing portions of the fresh plants obtained near the University grounds (2.2 kg) were extracted with boiling methanol and the solvent almost completely removed from the extract under reduced pressure. The extract was partitioned between carbon tetrachloride (500 ml) and water (500 ml) and the aqueous portion concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The aqueous concentrate was chromatographed on paper with n-butanol, ethanol, and water (4 : 1 : 4), and the dried papers (5 min a t  105') treated with ammoniacal silver nitrate or silver nitrate-potassium dichromate.6 A large brown spot, R(glucotropaeo1in) 1.0, indicated the presence of glucotropaeolin in the extract. The aqueous concentrate was adjusted to pH 6.8 by the addition of a 1~ sodium oitrate solution, followed by a myrosinase preparation (5 ml) from yellow mustard powder11 and ascorbic acid (5 mg). This mixture was incubated a t  room temperature for 24 hr. During this period a sharp, slightly lachrymatory odour developed in the extract. The digested ext'ract was steam- distilled with cohobation of the aqueous layer, using an oil trap containing benzene (2 ml) to oolleot any steam-volatile product. The residual aqueous material was mixed with a barium chloride solution, yielding a heavy white precipitate of barium sulphate, which did not appear prior to digestion with myrosinase. The clear filtrate was chromatographed on paper, using the procedure described above. A new spot appeared a t  R(g1ucose) 1.0, reacting only to the ammoniacal silver nitrate spray reagent. The benzene-soluble deam distillate was mixed with methanol which had been saturated with ammonia (10 ml), stoppered, and held overnight. This yielded, after three crystallizations from ethyl acetate, colourless rhombs of benzyl thiourea, m.p. 161.5-163' (Found: C, 58.0; H,  6-3;  N, 16.4. Calc. for C8HloN2S: C, 57.8; H, 6.1;  N, 16.9%). This demonstrated that benzyl isothiooyanate, sulphate, and glucose ware released by the incubation of the extract with myrosinase, consistent with the presence of glucotropaeolin.6 (b) L. bonariense The seed-bearing portions of fresh plants obtained near Lowood, Qld., were extracted whole in the same manner as the L. hy8sopifolium seeds above, and the aqueous concentrate thus obtained was examined by paper chromatography, as before. Two spots appeared, reacting to both spray reagents: one, the stronger of the two, R(glucotropaeo1in) 1.0, and the other a t  R(glucotropaeo1in) 0.30. 7 Kjaer, A., Conti, J., and Larsen, I., Acta chem. scand., 1953, 7, 1276. 8 Schultz, 0.

SHORT COMMUNICATIONS (c) C, bursa pastoris Fresh plants, obtained a t  Moggill, Qld., were extracted as for L. hyssop(f01ium and the resul- tant aqueous concentrate examined by paper chromatography, incubated with the myrosinase preparation, followed by application of the tests for sulphate and glucose as described above. A faint but definite spot appeared in the aqueous concentrate a t  R(glucotropaeo1in) 0.30 (sinigrin), and a positive test was obtained for the presence of sulphate and glucose in the concentrate, after incubation with myrosinase. Further fresh plants (80 kg) were steam-distilled in a batchwise operation (10 kg lots), using an oil trap containing diethyl ether, for 16 hr periods. The combined ether extracts were concentrated by careful removal of solvent through a column of Fenske helices (10 om) to a small volume (10 ml). This concentrate was fractionated through the semi-micro still to yield eight fractions of b.p. range 36-105". Fraction 8, b.p. 79-105" (1 ml), at5 1.3949, was shown by gas chromatography to contain two principal components. The infrared spectrum of this fraction as a liquid smear showed absorption bands at  2255 (CEK), 1645,1420, 988, and 918 om-l (vinyl), attributed to the component of interest and a strong band a t  3480 om-1 (hydroxyl) from the other component (ethanol). Fraction 8 (0.8 ml) was mixed with mercaptoacetic acid and hydrogen chloride in the manner described by Condo et a1.12 for the characterization of nitriles as their a-iminoalkyl meroaptoaoetic acid hydrochlorides. A derivative was obtained, m.p. 63' (dec.), which behaved identically with the corresponding derivative of allyl cyanide, b.p. 118.6", ng 1.4039, obtained by synthesis from allyl bromide.13 Ally1 cyanide is a well-known product of the decomposition of sinigrin during steam distillation from plant material, having been isolated by Will and Korner from oil of mustard in 1863.l4 Acknowledgments The author is indebted to Dr M.
