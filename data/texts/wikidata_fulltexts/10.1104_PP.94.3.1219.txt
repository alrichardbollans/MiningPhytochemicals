AdewusiDepartment of Chemistry, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, NigeriaABSTRACTThe turnover of dhurrin in green seedlings of Sorghum bicolor(Linn) Moench var Redland x Greenleaf, Sudan 70 has beeninvestigated using glyphosate and pulse-labeling studies with'4C-tyrosine and [14C]shikimic acid. The rate of dhurrin breakdownwas 4.8 nanomoles per hour in the shoot and 1.4 nanomoles perhour in the root. The rate of dhurrin accumulation in the shoot of4- to 5-day-old seedlings was high but decreased with age untilat the peak period of dhurrin accumulation, the rates of dhurrinsynthesis and breakdown were equal. Using a first order equation(an approximation) the rate of dhurrin synthesis (which equalsaccumulation plus breakdown rates) was 17.4 nanomoles perhour in the shoot and 4.1 nanomoles per hour in the root. In bothtissues, the breakdown rate was between 27 and 34% of theirsynthetic capacity within the experimental period. Dhurrin synthe-sis in green sorghum seedlings occurred in both the light anddark photoperiods but was faster in the dark period. The resultis discussed in relation to the possible metabolic roles of theturnover.The first observation that there might be a turnover ofcyanogenic glycosides in plants was made by Blumenthal etal. (6) when they administered ["4C]HCN as a gas to youngseedlings of sorghum, barley, pea, flax, and red and whiteclover and found that the radioactive HCN was incorporatedin remarkable yield (20-50%) into the amide carbon atom ofasparagine. Abrol and Conn (1) and Abrol et al. (2) extendedthese studies by feeding '4C-labeled amino acids to Lotus spp.and Nandina domestica and observed that radioactivity wasalso incorporated into the amide carbon atom of asparagine.Further studies showed that the radioactivity found in aspar-agine could only be derived from the HCN moiety of thecyanogenic glycosides formed from the labeled amino acids.These experiments showed that a B-glucosidase has limitedaccess to the cyanogens in these plants, thus releasing a smallquantity of HCN, which is metabolized (via f3-cyanoalanineformation) to asparagine. That asparagine is labeled whenradioactive precursors are fed to cassava was demonstrated byNartey (13), while Bediako et al. (5) showed qualitative evi-dence of the turnover of linamarin in cassava leaves.Bough and Gander (7) performed by far the most sophisti-cated experiments on the turnover of a cyanogenic glycosidein a plant system. They pulse-labeled etiolated Sorghum vul-gare seedlings with ['4C]tyrosine and chased it with cold L-tyrosine and/or water. They found a 40% decrease in thespecific activity of dhurrin in a 10-h period while the totaldhurrin content of the seedlings remained constant. Theycalculated the turnover rate ofdhurrin to be 50 nmol/h/shoot1219in seedlings containing 1.0 ,umol dhurrin/shoot. This corre-sponds to a metabolic half-life of 10 h and a complete break-down and synthesis of 1.0 imol dhurrin/shoot in a 20-hperiod. This pioneering work, however, had three major dis-advantages. (a) The experiments were carried out using etio-lated seedlings, which would not represent what normallyoccurs in green sorghum seedlings. (b) The turnover rate wascalculated over a 10-h span, which seemed too short a periodto estimate dhurrin turnover in green sorghum seedlings. (c)An exorbitant amount and price of radioactive chemicals wasconsumed, especially when '4C-incorporation into dhurrinwas only 3% or less (7).It has been demonstrated that dhurrin and its catabolicenzymes are compartmentalized in green sorghum seedlings.The vacuole of the epidermal cells is the site of glycosidestorage (14, 15), whereas the catabolic enzymes are found inthe mesophyll cells (17). As a result of this distribution ofsubstrate and enzymes, it becomes important to ask whetherthe turnover of dhurrin occurs in green sorghum seedlingsand, if so, at what rate? Glyphosate, as shown in Figure 1, isa known inhibitor of the shikimic acid pathway (16), whichleads to the formation of the aromatic amino acids includingtyrosine, which is the precursor of dhurrin (8). Glyphosate,supplemented with the aromatic amino acids, has been suc-cessfully used to inhibit dhurrin synthesis in 4-day-oldsorghum seedlings without adversely affecting other physio-logical processes for the next 5 days (Adewusi, unpublisheddata). This procedure has been used as an inexpensive methodto estimate the turnover of dhurrin in the shoot and root ofgreen sorghum seedlings over a 96-h period. Radioactivetyrosine and shikimic acid have also been fed as precursors ofdhurrin for comparison with the above-described glyphosatemethod.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsHigh purity glyphosate (free acid) was a generous gift of Dr.E. G. Jaworski (Monsanto Agricultural Chemical Company,St. Louis, MO).

They wereplanted on water-saturated vermiculite in plastic trays andallowed to germinate in a growth chamber preset at 26°C lightand 22°C dark temperature and 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod.All experiments including the feeding studies were carried outin the growth chamber.Glyphosate ExperimentsGlyphosate, neutralised with twice its concentration ofNaOH, was supplemented with the aromatic amino acids andadded to the vermiculite base of 4-d-old green sorghum seed-lings such that the final concentration ofglyphosate would beapproximately 2 mm and the aromatic amino acids 1 mmeach. Samples were taken and analyzed for total dhurrincontent. The experiment was repeated five times, and themean and SD are presented.Total Dhurrin ContentThis was estimated using the method of Gorz et al. (10).U-14C-Tyrosine ExperimentsFour-day-old green sorghum seedlings were administered40,uCi [U-'4C]tyrosine through the root in 5 ml containing 1mM phenylalanine and 1 mM tryptophan with and without 2mM glyphosate. After a 48-h feeding period, the roots werethoroughly washed with distilled water and the seedlingstransferred to a solution containing 1 mm each of tyrosine,phenylalanine, and tryptophan alone or supplemented with 2mM glyphosate. Samples were harvested immediately and at24, 72, and 96 h. The roots were detached from the shootsand analyzed separately. The experiment was repeated onceand average values are presented.Hydrolysis, Extraction, and Analysis of RadioactiveDhurrinHydrolysis of radioactive dhurrin was by the method ofGorz et al. (10). The hydrolysate was reduced to 10 ml, and2-mL aliquots were extracted 3 times with 2 mL of diethylether. Thin-layer chromatography of the ether extract wascarried out on Bakerflex silica gel lB flexible sheets in abenzene:ethyl acetate solution (5:1, v/v) for 3 to 4 h. Theplates were sprayed with 0.2% solution of 2',7'-dichloroflu-orescein and viewed under UV light. The bands were alsolocated using a Packard model 7201 radiochromatogramscanner. The radioactive bands were eluted with 1 mL ofdistilled water and counted in 10O% aqueous scintillation fluidusing a Beckman LS230.D-[2,3,4,5(n)-14C]Shikimic Acid ExperimentsFour ,uCi '4C-shikimic acid in 3 mL ofcold 400 uM shikimicacid was fed to 100 4-d-old green sorghum seedlings throughthe root for 48 h. After the feeding period, the roots werewashed thoroughly with distilled water and the seedlings wereput into 400 ,M cold shikimic acid. The roots were detachedfrom the shoots and analyzed separately for radioactive dhur-rin as indicated earlier at 0, 24, 72, 96, and 120 h after the0.250.20 °I-00.15E0.1001221 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1990 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In a repeat experiment, 6 uCi of '4C-shikimicacid was fed to 80 4-d-old green sorghum seedlings for 48 hand analyzed at 0, 24, 72, and 96 h after the feeding period.During both experiments, 400 AM cold shikimic acid wasreplenished such that the roots were fully immersed at alltimes.Diumal Variation of DhurrinThis was estimated by analyzing for total dhurrin contentof sorghum shoot at the beginning of both light and darkphotoperiods. The experiment was repeated four times. In allexperiments, total and/or radioactive dhurrin was expressedas its p-hydroxybenzaldehyde equivalent. Mean, SD, andregression coefficients were calculated using a Hewlett-Pack-ard calculator.RESULTSFigure 2A shows that the total dhurrin content of controlsorghum shoots increased by 1.1 mol between d 4 and 9 (96h), while that ofglyphosate-treated samples decreased by 0.28,umol between d 5 and 10 ofgrowth (96 h).Figure 2B shows that in the control shoots fed ['4C]tyrosinethere was a 24% loss in dhurrin radioactivity and a 20% lossin glyphosate-treated samples over a 96-h period.Figure 2C shows that when sorghum seedlings were fed 6,uCi of 14C-shikimic acid, radioactivity in dhurrin remainedvirtually constant over the first 72 h before a decrease of22%over the next 24 h. When fed 4 ,uCi of ['4C]shikimic acid, theradioactive content decreased by 40% over 72 h and finallyincreased to 320 dpm/shoot at 120 h. The late increase inradioactive dhurrin could have resulted from the proteolysisof reserve proteins coinciding with new growth (7).Figure 3A shows that the radioactivity decreased by 64%in the root over 96 h while the total dhurrin content remainedessentially constant at 0.22 ,mol/root during that period.With glyphosate treated roots, radioactivity in dhurrin de-cined by 60% over 96 h while the total dhurrin contentdeclined by 40% for 72 h and then increased dramatically to0.21 umol over the last 24 h.

The rate of dhurrinbreakdown estimated by this method was 3.1 nmol/h -shootover the 96 h experimental period. This is low when comparedwith the breakdown rate of 5.3 + 0.5 nmol/h -shoot obtainedthrough radioactive labeling studies. This may be due to thefact that inhibition of the shikimate pathway by 2 mm gly-phosate is not complete (only 90%), and second, 3 to 4% ofthe exogenous tyrosine could be converted to dhurrin (7 andSRA Adewusi, unpublished data). Supplementation of gly-phosate solution by the aromatic amino acids including ty-rosine was necessary to keep the seedlings in their physiolog-ical state for 5 days.1 223 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 5, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1990 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.Plant Physiol. Vol. 94, 1990The rate of dhurrin breakdown in etiolated sorghum seed-lings followed first order kinetics (7). The turnover of dhurrinobtained by radioactive labeling in this study also followedfirst order kinetics since the rate constant was the same (TableIA).Our present results indicate that the turnover rate ofdhurrinin green S. bicolor seedlings (4.8 nmol/h * shoot) is about 10%that of etiolated Sorghum vulgare seedlings (7). In addition,the half-life of dhurrin in green shoots is at least 20 times thatobserved in etiolated seedlings. The difference in the tworesults could be due to the fact that: (a) the earlier turnoverrate (7) was calculated over a 10-h period when dhurrinbreakdown was rapid; (b) metabolic pools of shikimate ingreen and etiolated seedlings might be different and thusaccount for rate differences; (c) compared with green seed-lings, competition for tyrosine by several metabolic processesin etiolated seedlings would be minimal, thus providing abun-dant tyrosine to replace dhurrin already catabolized; and (d)there may also be varietal differences in the rate of dhurrinmetabolism (SRA Adewusi, unpublished observations).Dhurrin accumulation in the shoot and root did not followfirst order kinetics. The rate constant obtained from Figure2A (Table IB) suggested a second order reaction, but the plotof 1/C (concentration) against time did not give a straightline. The kinetics are complicated by being biphasic (Fig. 4).The first order equation used in the calculation can only bean approximation. From these approximations, the mean rateof dhurrin accumulation between days 4 and 9 was 12.6nmol/h * shoot and 2.7 nmol/h in the root.The rate of dhurrin synthesis (17.4 nmol/h- shoot) can becalculated by summation of the rates of accumulation (12.6)and breakdown (4.8). The rate of dhurrin breakdown there-fore represented 27% of the synthetic capability of the shoot.In the root, the rate of dhurrin synthesis was 4.1 nmol/h.root, while the breakdown rate was 1.4 nmol/h/root, equiv-alent to 34% breakdown of the synthesized dhurrin in theroot.The results here reported tend to substantiate the hypothesisof Jones (11) that cyanogenic glycosides may serve bothprotective and primary metabolic functions; protective in thesense that sorghum seedlings accumulate more dhurrin thanis catabolized with the result that the stored dhurrin could actas a deterrent to predators. That cyanogenic glycosides repelpredators has been proved experimentally (1 1). The primarymetabolic function of dhurrin in green sorghum seedlingscould be through the provision of carbon atoms, for examplein the formation of ,B-cyanoalanine and asparagine. Further-more, M0ller and Conn (12) have speculated that dhurrinmay provide carbon atoms for ubiquinone biosynthesis onthe basis of the in vitro oxidation of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde(a breakdown product of dhurrin) to p-hydroxybenzoic acid,a known precursor of ubiquinone in plants.LITERATURE CITED1.
