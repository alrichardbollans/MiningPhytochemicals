Inhibitory effects of phylligenin and quebrachitol isolated from Mitrephora vulpina on 
platelet activating factor receptor binding and platelet agregation. 
 
ABSTRACT 
Phylligenine, together with quebrachitol, stigmasterol and two aporphine alkaloids—
oxoputerine and liriodenine—were isolated from the twigs of Mitrephora vulpina C.E.C. 
Fisch. They were evaluated for their ability to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor 
binding to rabbit platelets using 3H-PAF as a ligand and their antiplatelet aggregation effect 
in human whole blood induced by arachidonic acid (AA), collagen and adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP). Of all the compounds tested, phylligenin and quebrachitol exhibited 
potent and concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on PAF receptor binding, with IC50 
values of 13.1 and 42.2 µM, respectively. The IC50 value of phylligenin was comparable to 
that of cedrol (10.2 µM), a potent PAF antagonist. Phylligenin also showed strong dose-
dependent inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation induced by AA and ADP.
