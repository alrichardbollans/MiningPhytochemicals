and Sharmila Chattopadhyay*Abstract
Background: Podophyllotoxin (PTOX), the precursor for semi-synthesis of cancer therapeutics like etoposide,
teniposide and etophos, is primarily obtained from an endangered medicinal herb, Podophyllum hexandrum Royle.
PTOX, a lignan is biosynthetically derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate
changes in the P. hexandrum cell proteome potentially related to PTOX accumulation in response to methyl
jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation. High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by colloidal
Coomassie staining and mass spectrometric analysis was used to detect statistically significant changes in cell’s
proteome.
Result: The HPLC analysis showed approximately 7–8 fold change in accumulation of PTOX, in the 12day old cell
suspension culture (i.e. after 9days of elicitation) elicited with 100 μM MeJA as compared to the control. Using 2-DE
a total of 233 spots was detected, out of which 105 spots were identified by MALDI TOF-TOF MS/MS. Data were
subjected to functional annotation from a biological point of view through KEGG. The phenylpropanoid and
monolignol pathway enzymes were identified, amongst these, chalcone synthase, polyphenol oxidase, caffeoyl CoA
3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases, caffeic acid-O-methyl transferase etc.
are noted as important. The relation of other differentially accumulated proteins with varied effects caused by
elicitors on P. hexandrum cells namely stress and defense related protein, transcription and DNA replication and
signaling are also discussed.
Conclusions: Elicitor-induced PTOX accumulation in P. hexandrum cell cultures provides a responsive model system
to profile modulations in proteins related to phenylpropanoid/monolignol biosynthesis and other defense
responses. Present findings form a baseline for future investigation on a non-sequenced medicinal herb
P. hexandrum at molecular level.

Podophyllum hexandrum Royle, commonly referred to
as the Himalayan Mayapple, is an endangered perennial
herb belonging to the family Berberidaceae that is dis-
tributed on the lower slopes of the Himalayas in scrub
and forest, from Afghanistan to central China [1]. Roots
and rhizomes of P. hexandrum contain lignans such as* Correspondence: sharmila@iicb.res.in

date, PTOX has been used as the starting compound
for the production of the semi-synthetic drugs etoposide
(VP-16-213), teniposide (VM-26) and ethophos, which
are used in the treatment of lung and testicular cancers
[3], leukaemia and rheumatoid arthritis [4]. The Indian
species P. hexandrum (Figure 1) contains three times
more PTOX than its American counterpart P. peltatum,
which contains other lignans viz. α- and β-peltatins
[5,6]. However, peltatins do not contribute to the anti-entral Ltd. This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/10/1/34cancer properties of the plant [7]. To meet the commer-
cial demand, up till now PTOX has been extracted from
the rhizomes of P. hexandrum and P. peltatum collected
in the wild; chemical synthesis of PTOX is possible but
not economically feasible [8]. Therefore, rhizomes are in-
discriminately collected in large quantities to meet the
ever-increasing demand for the drug in modern medi-
cine. Severe habitat destruction and over-collection has
created an acute depletion in the population of this herb.
Together with a lack of organized cultivation, this has led
to P. hexandrum being classified as a critically endan-
gered species of the Himalayan region [9,10].
PTOX is derived biosynthetically from the phenylpro-
panoid pathway by the dimerization of two phenylpropa-
noid units [11]. The biosynthesis of the phenylpropanoid
unit starts with the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine,
which is deaminated by the phenylalanine ammonia-
lyase (PAL) to cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is chan-
neled through the general phenylpropanoid pathway
before entering the monolignol specific branch. This
branch includes two enzymatic reactions—a reduction
step catalysed by the cinnamyl-CoA:NADP oxidoreduc-
tase and a dehydrogenation step catalyzed by cinnamyl
alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD)— producing the cinnamyl
alcohols, also called monolignols. Dirigent mediated
coupling of two molecules of coniferyl alcohol produces
pinoresinol, which is the precursor of the lignans PTOX
and other lignans as well (Figure 2).
In vitro production of PTOX through cell culture of
Podophyllum spp. has been reported previously [12-16].
In addition to Podophyllum spp., a number of other
plants including Linum album, Juniperous chinensis and
Callitris drummondii have been investigated for thein vitro production of PTOX and its derivatives [17-19].
However, the production of PTOX using cell cultures
may not be sufficient for biotechnological production
systems [20]. Elicitation is an approach that may over-
come the limitations of the in vitro culture system.
In general, elicitation experiments have two main goals.
The first is the enhancement of secondary metabolite pro-
duction for commercial use. The second goal is to gain more
insight into the biosynthetic pathways leading to the forma-
tion and regulation of secondary metabolites. There are
many reports showing enhancement in the level of PTOX
following MeJA elicitation [21,22]. MeJA has also been used
to obtain enhanced production of PTOX in embryogenic
cell suspension cultures of P. peltatum [23]. Using elicitor-
induced plant cell cultures, Suzuki and co-workers [24]
showed that a large number of genes involved in secondary
metabolism including L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cin-
namate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase
and chalcone synthase were differentially regulated in re-
sponse to different elicitors in M. truncatula. Elicitors acti-
vate plant natural defense responses, including increased
secondary metabolite production. In this investigation, this
elicitation strategy has been exploited to obtain enhanced
PTOX accumulation in the cell suspension culture of
P. hexandrum, with a view to explore the cell’s proteome
having enhanced level of PTOX.
Proteomic studies in plant systems have primarily been
performed in fully sequenced model systems such as Arabi-
dopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), Populus trichocarpa
(black cottonwood), and Vitis vinifera (grape vine) since
mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics requires the
availability of a protein database [25]. Relatively few studies
have applied proteomics for investigating secondary metab-
olism of medicinal plants [26-28], and in particular have fo-
cused on applying proteomics for discovering new enzymes
involved in secondary metabolism [29,30]. The present
work was undertaken to explore protein profile of elicited
cell suspension culture of P. hexandrum resulting in
enhanced accumulation of PTOX. To accomplish this aim,
2-DE proteomic profiling of P. hexandrum cell suspension
cultures elicited with MeJA resulting in enhanced PTOX
content along with control culture devoid of MeJA was per-
formed which provided clear information regarding the dif-
ferential protein abundance. MALDI TOF-TOF MS/MS
analysis was performed for protein identification. Data were
subjected to functional annotation from a biological point
of view through KEGG. This investigation is an attempt on
proteomics analysis of P. hexandrum, an endangered non-
sequenced medicinal herb towards future exploitation.

was observed in elicited culture as compared to the con-
trol (data not shown).Protein abundance pattern of P. hexandrum cell culture
upon elicitation
Elicitation of P. hexandrum cell suspension culture with
MeJA led to the modification of its proteome profile.
2-DE was performed in triplicate to study the abundance
patterns of proteins extracted from control and elicited
cultures (9day after elicitation with 100 μM MeJA). The
experiment was repeated with three batches of inde-
pendent cultures for control and elicited samples. Owing
to sample limitation and economical issues, technical
replicates could not be prepared. The three biological
replicates of protein gels for each treatment were used
for further analysis. Figure 4a and 4b shows the repre-
sentative 2-DE gel images of control and elicited sam-
ples, respectively. Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips
(18 cm, pH 4–7) and colloidal Coomassie stain was
used. The protein yield of the employed protocol for
protein isolation was very similar in both control
(3.56 ± 0.36 μg of protein/mg of fresh tissue) and elicited
(3.28 ± 0.62 μg of protein/mg of fresh tissue) cultures.
Table 1 shows the number of total spots detected
(415 ± 5 in control and 492 ± 8 in elicited culture, re-
spectively) and the number of variable (those that were
qualitatively and quantitatively different as compared to
control) spots found after 2-DE of protein extracts from
control and elicited culture. 337 spots were common to
both the samples, while out of 233 differentially abun-
dant spots, 78 and 155 spots were detected in control
and elicited cultures, respectively, the mean coefficient
of variation being 34.6%.Figure 4 Representative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total
cell suspension cultures of P. hexandrum.A set of differentially abundant protein spots was
selected from control and elicited cultures. For that pur-
pose, differences in spot abundance was statistically eval-
uated using the t-test function implemented in the PD
Quest software. Means and standard deviations were cal-
culated from three independent sets of treatments (bio-
logical replicates). Spots showing differences between
control and elicited cultures with a P< 0.05 at any of
the time points were chosen for further analysis.
Identification of differentially expressed proteins
Out of the 233 differentially abundant spots, 105 spots were
significantly identified through MALDI TOF-TOF MS/MS.
Only the spots having MASCOT score≥60 (P< 0.05) were
considered as confident identification. Additional file 2
summarizes only the 105 identified proteins differentially
accumulated in the elicited culture. Additional file 3 shows
the sequences of all the identified peptides with the corre-
sponding ion score in brackets that were matched based on
the MS/MS patterns. Some of the representative spots of
major categories are annotated in Figure 5, the arrows and
numbers refer to the spots exhibiting significant changes in
relative spot abundance after elicitation, corresponding to
their respective SSPs (see Additional file 2). The 105 identi-
fied protein sequences were classified into 18 categories
according to KEGG [31], based on putative functions of
secondary metabolism (14 proteins), stress and defense
related protein (16 proteins), transcription and DNA repli-
cation (14 proteins), signaling (6 proteins), the principal
groups found. The functional distribution of the proteins is
represented in Figure 6.
Some of these proteins were present in more than
one spot. This co-migration of proteins is possible if
both present the same experimental pI and Mr. The

tions or isoforms. There were another sets of proteins inFigure 5 Annotated gel image representing predicted functions

heterologous sequence in the database. Wan and Liu
[32] reported that the apparent Mr values predicted by
SDS-PAGE had an error deviation of about ± 10% com-
pared with the theoretical values. In most of the cases,
this was because only a fragment of the protein se-
quence was included in the database. Isoforms of some
protein like pathogenesis related protein were identified
in more than one spot. This may be explained by differ-
ent splicing variants, or posttranslational modifications
or cleaved isoforms of the same protein [33].
Discussion
A search was made for proteins differentially accumu-
lated in cell suspension cultures of P. hexandrum eli-
cited with MeJA resulting enhanced accumulation of
PTOX. The ability to perform proteomic analyses of me-
dicinal plants without a fully sequenced and annotated
genome will provide a useful platform and form a base-
line for exploring and investigating the complex physio-
logical pathways related to metabolism, defence and
signaling of these medicinal plants. In this investigation
100 μM MeJA was noted as optimum for enhanced ac-
cumulation of PTOX which can be corroborated with
previous report where 2 to 10- fold enhancement of
PTOX was noted in cell suspension culture of L. album
[22]. The role of MeJA in triggering phenyl propanoid
biosynthetic pathway and elicitation of defense related
proteins are the major effects described previously.
Thus, our analysis is focused on proteins closely related
to these effects. However, proteins related to other cat-
egories have also been discussed in brief.
Proteins related to secondary metabolism
The major category of the identified protein was related to
secondary metabolism comprising of 13% of the total pro-
teins identified. This is in consistence with previous reports
of elicited cell cultures in which several secondary metabolic
enzymes were identified [28]. However, the proteomes of a
few medicinal plants with rich but incomplete sequence in-
formation have been explored, including Taxus cuspidate
[26], Catharanthus roseus [27], Papaver somniferum [28,34],
ginseng [35] and Chelidonium majus [36]. For proteomic
analysis of such organisms, one approach utilizes sequence

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/10/1/34homology to proteins already in a database. This approach
allows identification of highly conserved proteins such as
primary metabolic pathways proteins but not necessarily
enzymes involved in specific secondary metabolic path-
ways like PTOX biosynthesis which are specific to indi-
vidual plant species. Elicitor-mediated accumulation of
phenylpropanoid compounds in plant cell cultures has
been studied in greatest detail in parsley, chickpea, soy-
bean and alfalfa cells [37-40]. In our study also several
proteins related to phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways
were identified, which is consistent with previous studies,
for example- Chalcone synthase, it plays an essential role
in the biosynthesis of plant phenylpropanoids and cata-
lyzes the first step in flavonoid biosynthesis [41]. Likewise,
plant O-methyltransferases (OMTs) constitutes a large
family of enzymes that methylate the oxygen atom of a
variety of secondary metabolites including phenylpropa-
noids, flavonoids, and alkaloids. O-Methylation plays a key
role in lignin biosynthesis, stress tolerance, and disease re-
sistance in plants [42]. Monolignol pathway enzymes like
Caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCOMT), a class A
O-methyltransferase was found to be up-accumulated in
elicited culture [43] and is essential for the biosynthesis of
coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols, the precursors of lignins
and lignans [44,45]. Likewise S-adenosyl-L-methionine-
dependent methyltransferases (SAM-methyltransferases)
and caffeic acid-O-methyl transferase (CAOMT) identi-
fied as up-accumulated in the present study are the keyenzymes in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and monolignol
pathway [46,47]. The identification of these methyltrans-
ferases, suggests the probability of the presence of such
homologous proteins in P. hexandrum, which may have a
role in PTOX biosynthetic pathway.
The biosynthetic pathway of PTOX is yet to be
revealed to its full extent, however the identification of
several monolignol as well as phenylpropanoid pathway
related enzymes, after MeJA-elicitation substantially
adds to the available information. This approach may
be used to identify and trace the poorly categorized
pathway of PTOX. Similarly differential expression of
proteins related to other secondary metabolic pathways
were also observed indicating the enhancement of
homologous proteins related to PTOX biosynthetic
pathways following the MeJA elicitation. Proteins such
as polyphenol oxidase was identified as well, these have
diverse roles related to secondary metabolism as well
as defense, induction of these proteins following
wounding and elicitations have been reported vividly
[48]. Proteins related to other secondary metabolic path-
ways like anthocyanin pathway such as chalcone-flavone
isomerase and resveratrol synthase, involved in synthesis
of resveratrol (phytoalexin) were also observed which
may be due to MeJA elicitation as reported previously
[49]. Likewise dioxygenases and tyrosine decarboxylase
were also identified, these are important in the biosyn-
thesis of plant signaling compounds such as abscisic
Bhattacharyya et al. Proteome Science 2012, 10:34 Page 7 of 12
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/10/1/34acid, gibberellins, and ethylene and also of secondary
metabolites, notably flavonoids and alkaloids [50,51].
Stress and defense related protein
Jasmonates are known as defense gene regulators in vir-
tually all plant systems. The MeJA elicited culture also
showed an up-accumulation of defense/stress-related
enzyme, the second major category of the identified
protein, which forms 15% of the total proteins identi-
fied. Pathogenesis related proteins Pr-1 like protein and
intracellular PR-104 proteins were up-accumulated in
the elicited cells, which can be correlated with previous
reports [52,53]. In general, pathogenesis related proteins
are induced by pathogen challenge and exhibit antibac-
terial and antifungal activities [54]. Although PR-10 are
classified as defense response proteins, however, the
down-regulation of PR-10 was observed in present
study, which suggests that they may be involved in
functions different from defense, for example some
have ribonuclease activity and ligand binding capacity
[55] as well, but its precise function is still unclear.
Similarly a downregulation of alcohol dehydrogenase
was observed. Likewise the identification of other pro-
teins like glutathione transferase, benzothiadiazole-
induced S-adenosyl L-methionine salicylic acid carboxyl
methyl transferase, NBS/LRR resistance protein and
LRR kinase protein as a defense response following
elicitation is also a well known fact and may be corre-
lated with previous studies [49,56]. The ability of jas-
monate to induce variety of defence related proteins
reported previously can be corroborated with our inves-
tigation [57-59].
Signaling
Most proteins identified as signal transduction compo-
nents belong to calcium signaling pathways and include
a calmodulin, which increased in abundance in response
to elicitor treatment. Calcium flux is important for the
elicitor-induced accumulation of secondary metabolites
[60] and calmodulin is a ubiquitous calcium sensor.
Calmodulin has been implicated in the salicylic acid-
independent defense response in tobacco [61]. Phos-
phoinositide specific phospholipase C family protein
was found to be down-regulated. Binding of TFs to
DNA can be regulated via protein phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation which in turn regulate expression of
many target genes, including TF genes [62]. Therefore,
regulation of TF biosynthesis, activation, and inactiva-
tion provides a flexible network for regulation of plant
secondary metabolites.
Transcription and DNA replication
It is believed that all signal transduction pathways finally
converge on transcription factors (TFs), and almost allgenes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis are regu-
lated by specific TFs. Identification of TFs like Apetala 1
can be corroborated with previous reports where rapid
accumulation of AP2/ERF-domain TFs in response to
fungal elicitor or MeJA treatment has been shown [63].
Many genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway possess the
same TF-binding cis-elements and are regulated by the
same TFs. Similarly role of cis acting elements such as
MYB TFs in binding to specific phenylpropanoid path-
way genes has also been reported previously [64]. Myb
and bHLH, essential for regulating phenylpropanoid and
flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, can physically interact
with each other [65]. Role of R2R3 Myb transcription
factor in MeJA signal transduction and induction of
phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway genes is also
reported [66] indicating the essential roles of TFs in
regulation of plant polyphenolics like lignans. Down-
regulation of certain transcription factors like F-box
proteins has been observed. Role of these proteins has
been observed in various developmental processes in
plants, for example photomorphogenesis, circadian
clock regulation, self incompatibility, and floral meri-
stem and floral organ identity determination, involves
F-box proteins [67-69].
Proteins related to other metabolic pathways
The P. hexandrum cell suspension cultures were
induced from leaves therefore spots corresponding to
proteins related to various categories like electron trans-
fer chain, carbohydrate pathways, glycolysis, pyruvate
pathways, tricarboxylic acid pathway and other carbon
metabolism enzymes were also identified. Significant
down-regulation of some of these proteins like galacto-
nolactone dehydrogenase, quinone oxidoreductase and
inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase were observed.
Proteins related to other biological functions like protein
translocation, folding, modification, and degradation
were also identified. Previous work of cell proteome eli-
cited with fungal elicitors has also shown similar pro-
teins [27,28], which can be correlated with our study.
Proteins related to other categories like cell wall biosyn-
thesis, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, amino
acid metabolism was observed. Down regulation of some
of these proteins like aspartate aminotransferase was
noted. Interestingly cyclin A like protein involved in cell
cycle was observed to be down regulated which may be
correlated with previous study of significant decrease in
cell growth following MeJA elicitation [70,71]. Hormone
biosynthetic enzymes like 12-oxophytodienoic acid reduc-
tase, involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid, a sig-
naling molecule commonly induced in response to stress,
wound, and pathogenic and herbivore attacks and was
identified in our study and in a proteomics survey of a
C. roseus cell culture producing monoterpenoid indole
Bhattacharyya et al. Proteome Science 2012, 10:34 Page 8 of 12
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/10/1/34alkaloids. Jasmonic acid is a critical signaling molecule in
plant defense responses [60]. Rapid accumulation of en-
dogenous jasmonic acid in response to elicitation has
been noted in many plant cell cultures of diverse taxo-
nomic origins, and it has been suggested to mediate the
induction of many defense-responsive natural products.
In general, identification of proteins related to diverse
metabolic pathways following MeJA elicitation can be
corroborated with previous reports [49]. However, less is
known about how primary and secondary metabolic
pathways are coordinated to support increased secondary
metabolite production. Proteins related to transposon
and unknown biological processes were also observed
(see Additional file 2). The sequence information on P.
hexandrum is unavailable and the number of functionally
annotated ESTs is low at this time. As this number
increases, the proteome data will be proven even more
useful. In the existing databases, the proteins of unknown
function are denoted as unknown protein, hypothetical
protein or putative protein. The hypothetical proteins are
peptides generated by computer assisted theoretical
translation of nucleotide sequences but have never been
identified as protein products.
Understanding the temporal, spatial, developmental,
and environmental expression of proteins is useful for
further analysis of its function in any associated condi-
tion. The use of protein profiling, identification of pro-
tein classes and their expression profile at subcellular
level define the functions involved in metabolic path-
ways, which ultimately dictate the cellular physiology.
Thus, assigning a functional role to each of the yet
unidentified protein will be challenging and quite valu-
able in order to know their physiological significance
in P. hexandrum.
Conclusions
Proteomics research not only provides new insights
into protein expression patterns, but also enables
identification of many attractive candidates for further
investigation. Elicitor-induced PTOX accumulation in
P. hexandrum cell culture provides a responsive model
system to profile modulations of altered proteins.
Here, 2-DE combined to mass spectrometry led to the
identification of several different functional categories
of proteins like-secondary metabolism, stress and
defense, transcription and DNA replication and signal-
ing. Thirteen percent of the identified proteins were
related to secondary metabolism, identification of sev-
eral enzymes related to monolignol/phenylpropanoid
biosynthesis especially various methyl transferases like-
CCOMT and CAOMT was observed. Furthermore,
identification of these up-stream monolignol/phenyl-
propanoid pathway proteins also signifies their role in
controlling the PTOX biosynthetic pathway. Hence,information generated in the present study may sug-
gest that the biosynthesis of the PTOX could be regu-
lated by the expression of upstream genes of
monolignol pathway viz. CCOMT and CAOMT. Iden-
tification of several up-stream phenylpropanoid path-
way proteins also supports this notion. However, more
in depth investigation on high throughput analysis of
proteins, and measurement of secondary metabolic
intermediates will be essential for clear understanding
of the pathway especially in a non-model endangered
species like P. hexandrum. Dissection of the signaling
network will also lead to discoveries of more second-
ary metabolite biosynthetic genes and regulatory fac-
tors, and will facilitate a specific and efficient
engineering of the production of target secondary
metabolites. In summary, results shown in this study
provide valuable basic information of the cell prote-
ome of P. hexandrum that resulted due to enhanced
accumulation of PTOX, and offers interesting possibil-
ities for future research.
Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
Podophyllum hexandrum Royle plants were procured
from the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology
(a unit of CSIR), Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India as a
gift. Calli were induced from mature leaves in MS
medium [72] supplemented with 2.68 μM NAA and
8.88 μM BAP [73]. Callus was subcultured after every
two weeks in the above-mentioned medium. Cell sus-
pension cultures were initiated from freshly subcultured
brown friable calli of P. hexandrum in modified liquid
MS medium [15] containing 60 mM total N2 content,
1.25 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 6% glucose
and 11.41 μM IAA. Finally, cultures were elicited with
10–100 μM MeJA (Duchefa, Germany) on the third day
of initiation of culture. Each batch of cells was harvested
nine days after elicitation. The cells were collected by
centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, rinsed five times
with sterile distilled water and used for further study.
Lignan extraction and HPLC analysis
Lignans were extracted from P. hexandrum cells [14]. In
brief, 100 mg of control and treated cultures was
extracted with 2 ml ethanol for 20 min at 60°C in micro-
tubes and sonicated for 15 min. The supernatant was
collected after centrifugation and evaporated to dryness
under vacuum. Extracts dissolved in methanol were used
for HPLC analysis. PTOX (Sigma, USA) was used as a
standard. PTOX extractions were performed with three
biological replicates.
HPLC was carried out with Waters 515 HPLC Pump
and Waters 2998 photodiode-array detector. The system
was controlled with Waters Pump Control Module II.
Bhattacharyya et al. Proteome Science 2012, 10:34 Page 9 of 12
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/10/1/34Data analyses were performed with Empower 2 software.
The detector was set at 290 nm and separation was carried
out using an XTerra RP18, 5 μm, (4.6 × 250 mm i.d.) col-
umn. A guard column, XTerra RP18, 5 μm, was used to
safeguard the analytical column. Chromatographic condi-
tions were essentially as described earlier [6]. A linear gra-
dient was applied with acetonitrile as solvent (A) and
0.01% (v/v) H3PO4 in water as solvent (B). From 0 to 17
min, (A) increased from 40% to 67% and the flow-rate
increased from 0.8 ml min-1 to 1.0 ml min-1, from 17 to 18
min, (A) changed from 67% to 40% with 1.0 ml min-1 flow-
rate, and from 18 to 24 min, (A) was 40% and the flow-rate
decreased from 1.0 ml min-1 to 0.8 ml min-1. MS analysis
was performed in ESI positive ion-mode with Micromass
Q-T of microTM to determine the molecular weight of cell
culture extracted PTOX and standard PTOX.
Protein extraction
Proteomic studies were carried out as mentioned in [74]. In
brief, 1 g of cells were ground to a fine powder under liquid
nitrogen and suspended in extraction buffer (700 mM
Sucrose, 500 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA,
100 mM KCl, 2% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM
PMSF), and an equal volume of ice-cold Tris–HCl, pH 7.5
saturated phenol was added. The mixture was shaken at 4°C
for 30 min. After centrifugation (5000× g, 4°C, 30 min),
the phenol phase was collected. This phenolic phase was
extracted three times with extraction buffer. Protein was
precipitated from the collected phenol phase by adding five
volumes of 100 mM ammonium acetate in methanol and
incubating overnight at −20°C. The protein pellets were
rinsed twice with ice-cold methanol and acetone, respect-
ively. The pellet was dried and dissolved in resuspension
buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 56 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 2.5% (v/v) CHAPS]. Protein samples were
quantified using Bradford assay [75] with BSA as standard.
After 1 h incubation in rehydration buffer, 150 mM iodoa-
cetamide was added, and the protein extracts were incu-
bated for an additional 1.5 h to alkylate sulfhydryl groups
[28]. Protein samples were further purified using Ready
Prep 2-D Cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified pro-
tein was resuspended in IEF resuspension buffer [9 M
urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X 100, 20 mM DTT, 1%
Ampholyte (pH 3–10)].
Analytical 2-DE gel electrophoresis
Aliquots containing 400 μg of protein samples were
adjusted to a final volume of 315 μl with IEF resuspen-
sion buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g to remove
insoluble material, the sample was loaded onto an 18 cm
immobilized pH gradient strip (pH 4–7; Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) for passive rehydration. Pro-
grammed IEF was performed with the Protean IEF cell(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Prior to second dimension migra-
tion, the strip was equilibrated twice in Equilibration
Buffers I and II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), for
15 min each. The second dimension SDS-PAGE was
performed with 12% resolving gels and 3.9% stacking
gels in a protean II xi cell. The gels were stained with
colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (CBB) and ana-
lyzed as mentioned in [76].
Gel images were acquired using Versa-Doc image sys-
tem (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and the differentially
expressed proteins were identified using the PD-Quest
analysis software version 8.0.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). The quantity of each spot in a gel was normalized
as a percentage of the total quantity of valid spots in that
gel. Student’s t-test was applied to compare the spots’
relative volume between two groups.
MS/MS analysis and protein identification
Significant spots with at least a 2.0-fold difference
(P< 0.05) were excised and digested with trypsin (In-gel
trypsin digestion kit, Pierce, USA). The trypsin-digested
peptides were used for MALDI TOF-TOF MS/MS pro-
tein identification (MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectropho-
tometer, ABI-4800 from Applied Biosystems, USA).
Data were interpreted using the GPS Explorer Soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems), and an automated database
search was carried out using the MASCOT program
(Matrix Science Ltd., London, U.K.). MS/MS data were
used to perform protein identification by searching in a
non-redundant protein sequence database (NCBI nr—
20070216; 4626804 sequences, 1596079197 residues)
using a MOWSE algorithm as implemented in the
MASCOT search engine version 3.5 (Matrix science:
www.matrixscience.com). The following parameters
were used for database searches: taxonomy, viridiplantae
(green plants; 186963 sequences); cleavage specificity,
trypsin with 1 missed cleavage allowed; mass tolerance
of 100 ppm for precursor ions and a tolerance of 0.2 Da
for the fragment ions; allowed modifications, carbami-
domethyl (fixed), oxidation of Met (variable), cleavage
by trypsin, cuts C-term side of KR unless next residue
is P. According to MASCOT probability analysis, only
significant hits with a MASCOT score ≥ 60 (P< 0.05)
were accepted.
Functional annotation
To evaluate the functional categories and hierarchies of
identified proteins, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
Genes and Genomes, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) was
used [77]. The theoretical peptide mass and pI of the
polypeptides were evaluated at EXPASy (http://www.
expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html) [78,79] for final confirm-
ation according to their positions in the 2-DE gel map.
