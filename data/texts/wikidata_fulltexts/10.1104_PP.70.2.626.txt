S.) and Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science,Kagoshima University, Korimoto 1, Kagoshima 890, JapanABSTRACTA neutral growth inhibitor, for which the name raphanusanin is proposed,has been isolated in crystalline form from light-exposed Sakurajima radish(Raphanus sativus var. hortensis f. gigantissimus Makino) seedlings andidentified as a new compound, 3-methoxy-4-methylthio-2-piperithione byspectrometric analyses.Applied raphanusanin inhibited the hypocotyl growth of etiolated radishand lettuce seedlings at concentrations higher than 1.5 x 10-6 molar.The endogenous raphanusanin contents in cotyledons and hypocotyls ofradish seedlings increased more under red light, but decreased or main-tained the initial level in the dark. Its content in roots showed almost nochange between the light and dark materials.We reported previously (3) that light inhibition of hypocotylgrowth of Sakurajima radish seedlings might be induced by theincrease in endogenous growth inhibitors in relation to the expo-sure to light. Of the growth inhibitors, two neutral ones wereisolated from the light-exposed seedlings of Sakurajima radishand identified as l-f., 4-di-O-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinna-moyl) gentiobiose (1, 4) and l-f8-0-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyoxy-cinnamoyl)-D-glucose (2) by spectrometric analyses and chemicalresponses.This paper reports on the isolation, identification, and biologicalactivity of another neutral growth inhibitor, tentatively namedraphanusanin, and also on the quantitative change of endogenousraphanusanin in relation to the exposure to red light.MATERIALS AND METHODSExtraction and Isolation. Sakurajima radish (Raphanus sativusvar. hortensis f. gigantissimus Makino) seeds harvested in Saku-rajima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, 1981, were germinated onmoist filter paper and grown in the dark for 2 d at 25°C. Etiolatedseedlings were irradiated with white fluorescent light (2 w/m') forI d at 25°C. Ten kg of green seedlings were homogenized with ablender and extracted with 30 L 70%o aqueous methanol. Thefiltered extract was concentrated at 40°C in vacuo to give anaqueous residue. The aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 7.5with I M phosphate buffer and extracted with an equal volume of'To whom reprint requests should be sent.ethyl acetate three times. The neutral ethyl acetate fraction wasdried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and then evaporated to dryness invacuo to give 22.7 g crude material. The crude material waschromatographed on a column (9 x 60 cm) ofsilicic acid (Kieselgel70-325 mesh, Nakarai Co. Ltd.) with benzene:ethyl acetate solventsystem by increasing the ethyl acetate concentration in a series of10%o steps (500 ml/step). Biological activity was determined usingSakurajima radish hypocotyl test (3). The active fraction wasdetected in the 30% to 40% ethyl acetate in benzene. The eluate ofthis fraction was evaporated to dryness in vacuo to give 4.2 g crudeoil. It (4.2 g) was chromatographed on a column (3.8 x 30 cm) ofthe same silicic acid with chloroform:acetate solvent system in aseries of 5% steps (500 ml/step). The active fraction was detectedin the 0% to 5% ethyl acetate in chloroform and evaporated todryness in vacuo to give 2.7 g material. It (2.7 g) was furtherchromatographed on a column (3.8 x 30 cm) with n-hexane:ethylacetate solvent system in a series of 10% steps (250 ml/step). Theeluate with 30% to 40% ethyl acetate in n-hexane contained 752mg active material. The active material (752 mg) was purified onpreparative TLC (Kieselgel 60 GF2M with 0.25 mm thickness fromMerck Co. Ltd.) with chloroform:acetic acid (95:5, v/v). Theactive zone (RF, 0.46-0.61) was scraped off and eluted with 300 mlethyl acetate, giving an evaporation of 274 mg of a yellowish oil.It (274 mg) was further purified on TLC (Kieselgel 60 GF254) withchloroform:ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v). A partially purified activeeluate (142 mg) from TLC plate was fmally purified by HPLC(Waters Associate system 500, 25 kg/cm2, Prep Pak-500/C18,water:methanol, 3:2, v/v, 200 ml/min). An active eluate (retentiontime, 12.5-14.7 min) was filtered through a 5-,um pore-size filter(LS-type, Millipore Corp.) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo at40°C. Its recrystallization from methanol:water and finally CC14-n-hexane gave 34 mg of colorless needles.Spectrometric Analyses. Optical rotation was measured withJASCO J-26. IR spectra were obtained in KBr with JASCO IRspectrometer, UV spectra in methanol with Hitachi UV spectrom-eter. 'H NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz with Hitachi R-900 spectrometer, 13C NMR spectra at 22.6 MHz. The high andlow resolution MS (direct inlet) were measured at 70 ev withJEOL JMS-D 300.Bioassay. Ten uniform 2-d-old etiolated seedlings were placedon filter paper moistened with 1.3 ml of test solutions in a 4.5-cmPetri dish. Petri dishes were kept in the dark at 25°C for I d andthen hypocotyl length was measured. Lettuce seeds were germi-nated on moist filter paper under continuous white fluorescentlight (about 1,000 lux) at 25°C for 1 d and then grown in the dark626 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 6, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1982 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The raphanusanin contents inthe red light- and dark-grown radish seedlings were determinedas follows. Uniform seedlings grown in vermiculite in the dark for4 d at 25°C were transferred to continuous red light (2 w/m2,combination of red fluorescent tubes and red filter) or kept in thedark at 25°C for I d. Seedlings were sectioned into cotyledons,hypocotyls, and roots with a razor under dim green light, andimmediately after sectioning segments were frozen at -20°C.Frozen segments were extracted and fractionated as describedabove to obtain the neutral ethyl acetate fraction which wassubjected to preparative TLC (Kieselgel 60 GF2u) with chloro-form:acetic acid (95:5, v/v) and n-hexane:ethyl acetate (2:3, v/v).The eluate from a zone corresponding to raphanusanin was sub-jected to HPLC (uBondapak C15; 1.7 kg/cm2; water:methanol, 3:2,v/v; I ml/min; 254 nm detector; retention time of raphanusanin,9.29 min).

Raphanusanin was obtained asa crystalline compound, Tm 74.8 to 75.0°C, [ICiD25- 1160 (c =0.125, methanol). It is soluble in water, methanol, acetone, andethyl acetate, but is insoluble in n-hexane. Its RF values on aKieselgel 60 GF25 (Merck) plate developed with chloroform:aceticacid (95:5, v/v), n-hexane:ethyl acetate (2:3, v/v), and chloro-form:ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) were 0.53, 0.49, and 0.46, respectively.The IR spectrum (KBr pressed disc, Fig. 1) had Vm,,, at 3,150C(NH); 1,555, 1,540, 1,300, and 1,113 ( |N ); 1,457 (CH2);S1,345 (SCH3); and 1.075 cm-' (-0--). UV spectrum has Xmes""269 nm (e = 14,000). The high resolution MS spectrum gave amolecular ion at m/z 191.04057 corresponding to the formulaC7H13N0S2. Other diagnostic ions were found at m/z 176 (49),627,' www.plantphysiol.orgon May 6, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1982 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.Plant Physiol. Vol. 70, 1982144 (53), 128 (17), 100 (20), and 85 (100, base peak). The 'H NMRspectral assignments for raphanusanin are given in Table I. Twosinglets at 8 2.20 (3H) and 3.44 (3H) were assigned to a methylthiogroup and a methoxoyl group, respectively. The assignments ofthe remaining signals could be deduced from spin decouplingexperiments. On irradiation at 8 2.42, two broad triplets at 8 3.20(IH) and 3.57 (2H) collapsed to broad singlets. Irradiation at 83.20 caused the doublet at 8 5.11 (1H) to change to a singlet anda change in the multiplet at 8 2.27 to 2.53 (2H). These datasuggested the structure of raphanusanin as a 3-methoxy-4-meth-ylthio-2-piperithione (Fig. 2). The structure was further supportedby the "3C NMR spectrum (Table I). Thus, raphanusanin isproposed to be a new compound different from other growthinhibitors such as xanthoxin (6), inhibitor Y (5), raphanusol A (1,4), and B (2) which are believed to play an important role in lightinhibition of hypocotyl growth.Biological Activity of Raphanusanin. The biological activity ofraphanusanin was tested with 2-d-old etiolated Sakurajima radish(hypocotyl length, about 10 mm) and lettuce (hypocotyl length,about 3 mm) seedlings (Fig. 3). Raphanusanin inhibited growthof hypocotyls at concentrations higher than 1.5 x 10-6 M in bothspecies.Raphanusanin Contents in Cotyledons, Hypocotyls, and Rootsin Relation to the Exposure to Red Light. Table II shows theeffects of red light on the growth of radish seedlings and endoge-nous raphanusanin contents. Hypocotyl growth was strikinglyinhibited with the exposure to red light, but root one almost not.Raphanusanin content in cotyledons of seedlings grown for I dunder red light was 1.5 times the initial one both on a fresh weightand a segment basis, whereas that in cotyledons of dark-grownseedlings decreased about 30% of the initial one. Its content inhypocotyls of red light-grown seedlings increased more than 2times the initial one, while that of dark-grown seedlings keptalmost the initial one. Its contents in roots decreased about 75% ofthe initial one both in the light- and dark-grown seedlings.From these results, it is suggested that a new growth inhibitor,raphanusanin, may play an important role in light inhibition ofhypocotyl growth of Sakurajima radish seedlings as well as ra-phanusol A and B.Acknowledgement-We thank Dr. Y.
