Onze substâncias foram isoladas das raízes de Spiranthera odoratissima: dois novos limonóides,
o limonóide já conhecido limonina, três alcalóides furoquinolínicos (dictamina, γ-fagarina e
esquimianina), três alcalóides β-indoloquinazolínicos (rutaecarpina, evodiamina e
1-hidroxirutaecarpina), a cumarina aurapteno e β-sitosterol. A elucidação estrutural dessas substâncias
foi realizada através de técnicas espectrais como IV e RMN em uma e duas dimensões; as estruturas
novas foram confirmadas por difração de raios-X.
Eleven substances have been isolated from the roots of Spiranthera odoratissima, two new
limonoids, the known limonoid limonin, three furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamnine, γ-fagarine and
skimmianine, three β-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, rutaecarpine, evodiamine and
1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, the coumarin aurapten and β-sitosterol. Structure elucidation has been carried
out by IR as well as 1D and 2D NMR; the new structures were also confirmed by X-ray
crystallographic analyses.

Introduction
Spiranthera odoratissma St. Hil., is a shrub found in the
central Brazilian savannah, as well as in Bolivia.1 In Mato
Grosso state it is known by the vernacular name of “manacá”,
being used in folk medicine to treat syphilis, rheumatism,
kidney infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, gout,
acne and boil.2 This plant has already been investigated
from chemistry viewpoint. From a specimen collected in
Bahia were isolated furoquinoline alkaloids; coumarins and
terpenes.3 The Rutaceae family is characterized by the
abundance of anthranilic acid derived alkaloids coumarins,
limonoids and flavonoids mainly.4
We have been interested in the chemistry of Rutaceae,5-8
and as part of ongoing work on this family, in this study we
describe the isolation and the identification of two new
limonoids, as well as the known limonin. Also described are
the isolation and identification of the furoquinoline alkaloids
γ-fagarine dictamnine, skimmianine, the β-indoloquinazoline
alkaloids rutaecarpine, evodiamine and 1-hydroxy-
rutaecarpine, the coumarin aurapten and β-sitosterol.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
Melting points were measured in a Mettler FP-80
apparatus and are uncorrected. Specific rotations were
determined in a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. The IR
spectra were obtained in a Bomem FT-IR MB100
equipment with the samples in KBr pellets. 1H and 13C
NMR spectra were measured in Bruker AC-200 (200 MHz),
ARX-400 (400 MHz) and Varian Mercury-300 (300 MHz)
apparatus. The chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm
and the coupling constants (J) in Hertz; TMS was used as
1348 Ribeiro et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
internal standard, as well as the residual hydrogen from
the solvents (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6). Radial preparative
chromatography (RPC) was carried out with a
Chromatotron apparatus and were performed with Merck
Kiesegel 60 PF254. Column chromatography (CC) was
performed with silica gel 60 (Merck, 63-230 μm), and flash
column chromatography with silica (Merck, 43-63 μm).
Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried
out with Merck Kiesegel 60 F254 (0.25 mm) plates.
Plant material
The roots from S. odoratissima were collected at Cuiabá-
Barão de Melgaço road (Km 1) in December 1999. A voucher
specimen was deposited at Central Herbarium of
Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (registration # 24246).
Extraction and isolation of compounds
The roots of S. odoratissima (3.3 kg) were macerated at
room temperature with dichloromethane (3 x 8L), with
occasional stirring, during 7 days. The dichloromethane
extract-DCE (126 g; 3.82%) was obtained after filtration
and solvent removal in vacuo. Subsequent extraction was
performed with methanol (3 x 8L) using the same procedure
above, affording the methanol extract-ME (120 g; 3.64%).
An aliquot of DCE (20.0 g) was submitted to conventional
acid-base extraction (HCl 1%; 4 x 100 mL) and the alkaloid
fraction (190 mg) was chromatographed by RPC, in a 4 mm
radial plate, with hexane-CHCl3 (8:2; 100 mL); CHCl3 (250
mL) and CHCl3-MeOH (95:5; 100 mL), affording 6 fractions.
The furoquinoline alkaloids γ-fagarine (15 mg), dictamnine
(8 mg) and skimmianine (30 mg) were isolated after washing
fractions 2, 3 and 4 with Et2O.
Another DCE fraction (42.5 g) was filtered in a silica
column (400 g) with petrol ether (0.5 L), CH2Cl2 (2 L),
CHCl3 (1 L), CHCl3-MeOH (99:1; 2 L), CHCl3-MeOH (9:1;

chromatographed by RPC (hexane- CH2Cl2; 9:1; 7:3; 1:1),
CH2Cl2 and CHCl3-MeOH (99:1), affording the coumarin
aurapten (50 mg), after washing the crude hexane-CH2Cl2
(7:3) fraction with EtOH. Fraction 4 [from hexane-CH2Cl2
(99:1)] was submitted to medium pressure chromatography
using the gradient solvent system: hexane-CH2Cl2 (2:8;
300 mL), (1:9; 70 mL), CH2Cl2 (150 mL), CH2Cl2-MeOH
(9:1; 250 mL). Aurapten (109 mg) was obtained after

chromatography using the solvent system: CH2Cl2 (300
mL), CH2Cl2-CH3CN (98:2; 200 mL), (95:5; 300 mL), (7:3;
200 mL); (1:1; 300 mL) and MeOH (200 mL). The
combined CH2Cl2-CH3CN (98:2 and 95:5) fractions (2.5
g) were re-submitted to medium pressure chromatography
employing the gradient hexane-CHCl3 (1:9; 400 mL),
CHCl3 (200 mL), CHCl3-MeOH (95:5; 300 mL), (9:1; 300
mL), (1:1; 200 mL) and MeOH (200 mL). Limonin (3)
(130 mg) precipitated after EtOH addition to the combined
hexane-CHCl3 (1:1) and CHCl3 fractions. The supernatant
liquid was chromatographed by CC in hexane-CHCl3 (2:8;
270 mL), CHCl3 (50 mL), CHCl3-CH3CN (8:2; 200 mL),
(6:4; 150 mL), (3:7; 100 mL), CH3CN (50 mL), CH3CN-
EtOH (7:3; 100 mL) and (1:1; 150 mL). Skimmianine (30
mg) was obtained from the combined hexane-CHCl3 (2:8)
and CHCl3 fractions after solvent removal and washing
the solid with EtOH. The combined CHCl3-MeOH (95:5)
fractions were chromatographed by CC using CH2Cl2 (50

200 mL), EtOAc (200 mL), EtOAc-MeOH (8:2; 200 mL)
and MeOH (100 mL). The combined CH2Cl2-EtOAc (8:2)
and (7:3) fractions were submitted to RPC with CHCl3,
CHCl3-MeOH (95:5), (9:1) and EtOAc-MeOH (9:1).
Limonin (3) (60 mg) was obtained after solvent removal
from fraction CHCl3-MeOH (9:1).

to CC in CH2Cl2 (300 mL), CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1; 150 mL),
(97:3; 50 mL), (95:5; 350 mL), (9:1; 150 mL), (1:1; 50
mL) and MeOH (50 mL). A precipitate (80 mg) was
obtained by adding EtOH to the combined CH2Cl2

employing CH2Cl2 (150 mL), CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1; 100
mL), (95:5; 100 mL), (1:1; 50 mL) and MeOH (50 mL).
Rutaecarpine (4) (7 mg) was isolated after solvent removal
from the combined CH2Cl2 fractions; evodiamine (5) (5
mg) was isolated after solvent removal from the combined

Single crystal X-ray analysis
Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collections were
performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD
diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid
N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoK α radiation
(0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 50° in 2θ, with a
redundancy of 4 in the phi scans and omega scans with kappa
offsets modes. The final unit cell parameters were based on
all reflections. Data collections were made using the
COLLECT program;9 integration and scaling of the reflections
were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of
programs.10 No absorption corrections were applied.
The structures were solved by direct methods with
SHELXS 8611 and SHELXS-97.12 The models were refined by
full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.13 All the
hydrogen atoms were stereochemically positioned and refined
with the riding model.12 Hydrogen atoms of the CH and CH2
groups were set isotropic with a thermal parameter 20% greater
than the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of the
atom to which each one was bonded. This percentage was set
to 50% for the hydrogen atoms of the CH3 groups. Data
collections and experimental details for the complexes are
summarized in Table 3. The programs SHELXL-97,13 and
ORTEP-314 were used within WinGX15 to prepare materials
for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles,
and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre (see below).
Results and Discussion
Limonoid (1) has been isolated from the
dichloromethane extract from the roots of S. odoratissima
as a white amorphous solid (mp 174-177 oC), presenting
[α]D25 (CHCl3): – 26º. The IR spectrum has shown
absorptions at 3405 (OH), 1767 (lactone), 1741 (α,β-
unsaturated ester) and 1714 (ketone).
1H NMR spectrum presented signals related to the
β-substituted furan ring, where H-21 and H-23 appeared as
multiplets at δ 7.41 and at δ 7.36, respectively. The
β-furan hydrogen H-22 appeared as a double doublet at δ
6.37 (J= 1.7, 0.8 Hz). The hydrogen H-17, from the
δ-epoxylactone ring, was observed at δ 5.54 (s, 1H).
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra from (1) has shown
similarities with the correlated spectra of (3), also isolated
in this study, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. The absence of
two doublets, associated to the geminal hydrogens at
C-19, very common in structures related to (3), displaying
a A,D-seco ring,16 when linked with the low intensity,
quaternary carbon signal observed at δ 182.5, from the
DEPT experiment, was a good indication for the presence
of a carbonyl group at C-19 in 1. HMBC spectrum has
shown long distance coupling (J3) between H-1, H-9 and
C-19, confirming that C-19 in 1 is oxidized.
The α,β-unsaturated ester moiety, detected by the IR
spectrum, was further confirmed by 1H NMR (δ 3.71, s, 3H;
-CO2CH3), as well as by the signals at δ 165.5 (-CO2CH3)
and δ 52.3 (-CO2CH3) in 13C NMR. The olefinic hydrogens
H-1 and H-2 were detected as two doublets at δ 6.65 and δ
6.12 respectively; the cis configuration of the double bond
could be determined by the coupling constant value (J1,2 =
12.4 Hz). HSQC spectrum showed correlation between
these two protons and the carbons at δ 151.6 (C-1) and δ
123.2 (C-2), respectively.

The DEPT 13C NMR spectrum presented two signals
related to methylenic carbons at δ 38.1 (C-6) and δ 41.2
(C-12). HMBC experiment has shown H-6 correlation with
C-7 (δ 207.3; J2) and C-4 (δ 87.6; J3). The methylenic
hydrogen H-6 resonated at δ 3.24 (dd, J= 18.4, 10.4 Hz, H-
6
ax
) and δ 2.74 (dd, J= 18.4, 2.5 Hz, H-6
eq); COSY spectrum
has shown coupling of both hydrogen with H-5 at δ 3.09
(dd, J= 10.4, 2.5 Hz).
Reasonably similar values have been observed when
comparing the 13C NMR data for rings B and D in
compounds (1) and (3) (Table 2). DEPT experiment,
however, presented three signals related to methylenic
carbons in (3) and only two signals related to methylenic
carbons in (1). The hydroxyl group, shown to be present
in (1) by the IR spectrum, nevertheless, should be located
at C-11 or C-12 in ring C. Furthermore, the carbinolic
hydrogen appeared as a broad doublet at δ 4.51 (J= 6.7
Hz, 1H), which has been associated to δ 66.4 signal
(HSQC), indicating that H-11 couples only with one H-
12
eq. No coupling was observed between H-11 and H-9
and H-12
ax
. The HMBC spectrum showed a long distance
coupling (J3) with C-8 (δ 48.5), confirming that the
hydroxylated carbon is C-11. The α stereochemistry of
the OH group was determined by X-ray crystallography
(Figure 2). The H-12 methylenic hydrogens were observed
at δ 1.83 (d, J= 15 Hz, H-12
ax
) and δ 1.61 (m, H-12
eq).
HMBC showed long range coupling (J3) between H-12
ax

1351Limonoids from Spiranthera odoratissima St. HilVol. 16, No. 6B, 2005
with C-9 (δ 43.9), C-14 (δ 65.1), C-17 (δ 77.8) and C-18
(δ 19.2).
Four singlets (3H) relative to the methyl groups, were
observed at δ 1.02 (H-18), δ 1.16 (H-30), δ 1.44 (H-29) and
δ 1.49 (H-28). The correct attribution of each methyl group
position was carried out by using HMBC and HSQC
experiments. The long distance correlation of δ 1.02 (Me-
18) with C-12 (δ 41.2), C-13 (δ 36.5), C-14 (δ 65.1), C-17
(δ 77.8), and δ 1.16 (C-30) with C-7 (δ 207.3), C-8 (δ
48.5), C-9 (δ 43.9) and C-14 (δ 65.1), could be easily
observed in HMBC spectrum.
The structure presented for compound (1) was definitely
confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 2).
The second new limonoid (2), was obtained from the
methanol extract of the roots of S. odoratissima, as a white
solid presenting a high mp (> 300 oC) and [α]D25 -20
(CHCl3). The IR spectrum presented absorptions at 1766
(lactone), 1742 (α,β-unsaturated ester) and 1707 (ketone).
Compound (2) 1H NMR spectrum presented high
similarity with the one from compound (1), indicating a
limonoid with a β-substituted furan ring, as shown by the
two α-furan hydrogen at δ 7.39 (m) and the β-furan
hydrogen at d 6.34 (m). An additional signal was observed
at δ 2.10 (s, 3H), being attributed to the presence of an
extra methyl group in (2).
13C NMR spectrum presented 29 signals, showing that
compound (2) should have two more carbons than the
analogous (1); a quaternary carbon at δ 170.5 and a methyl
group at δ 21.2 were observed by the DEPT experiment
indicating the presence of an acetyl group in this
compound.
These 1H and 13C NMR data, in association with the
absence of a hydroxyl absorption in IR spectrum led to the
conclusion that the hydroxyl group was esterified in (2).
Single crystal X-ray diffraction has confirmed the proposed
structure for (2) (Figure 3).
The known compounds were identified through
comparison of their spectral data with the ones in the
literature, limonin (3),17 dictamnine, skimmianine;18 the β-
indoloquinazoline alkaloids rutaecarpine (4), evodiamine
(5)19 and 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine (6),20 and the coumarin
aurapten.21 The isolated alkaloids and limonoids have been
described as typical metabolites from the Rutaceae.22
