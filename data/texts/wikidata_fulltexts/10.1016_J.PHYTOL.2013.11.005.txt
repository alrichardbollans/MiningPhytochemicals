IntroductionAcne is an inflammatory disease caused by gram-positivebacterium Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). It is the most commonskin disease that affects areas covering the oil glands and hairfollicles usually found on the face, chest, upper arm, back and trunk(Leydon, 1997). P. acnes is an obligate anaerobic organism that hascapability to metabolise sebaceous triglycerides into fatty acidsinside sebaceous gland. Also, due to the increased production ofsebum, thickening of epidermis at the outlet of pilosebaceous unitoccurs resulting in obstruction to the flow of sebum outwards and acomedo develops (Chomnawang et al., 2005; Coenye et al., 2012).Due to increased fatty acids content, the production of variousreactive oxygen species (ROS) from the damaged follicular walls leadto the release of various cytokines like interleukin 8 (IL 8) andtumour necrosis factor (TNF a) as host immune response. All theseevents lead to inflammation and pathogenesis of the disease. Theusual drugs used in the treatment of acne have various side effects.The topical antibiotics can lead to dryness, redness, irritation of skinand hypopigmentation, whereas oral antibiotics can cause gastro-intestinal disorders and increase the risk of venous thromboembo-lism (Arican et al., 2005; Shaw and Kennedy, 2007).* Corresponding author.

(Rosaceae) is a singlespecies of the genus Leucosidea, found in Eastern Cape, Free Stateand KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa (Van Wyk et al.,2008). It is used against various ailments including severeinflammation of the eyes and in the treatment of ophthalmia(Aremu et al., 2010). The Zulus, a South African tribe, use the plantas an astringent in combination with other plants (Fouche et al.,2008). Earlier researchers have reported in vitro antimicrobial,antioxidant, acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitory (Aremu et al., 2011)and moderate anticancer activity (Fouche et al., 2008) of L. sericea.There are very few reports on the phytochemical investigation ofthe plant. Previous researchers have isolated two phloroglucinols,namely, aspidinol and desaspidinol from the leaves and flowers,while the presence of b-sitosterol and b-sitostenone werereported from the stems (Bosman et al., 2004; Nair et al., 2012).In our continuing search for bioactive molecules from plantresources, present paper describes the isolation and characterisa-tion of four long chain fatty alcohols with one phloroglucinolderivative and their anti-bacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflam-matory activity.2. Results and discussion2.1. Identification of isolated compoundsThe ethanol extract of dried and powdered leaves of L. sericeasubjected to chromatographic purification resulted into isolationof five compounds 1–5. Structural assessment of these compounds Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.CH3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3HO OHFig. 1. Structure of compound 4 isolated from L. sericea.R. Sharma et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 7 (2014) 124–129 125was characterised by Mass, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data.Assignment of signals was facilitated by COSY, HSQC and HMBCexperiments. The known compounds obtained in this study, phytolacetate (1) (Itoh et al., 2003), triacontanol (2), (Tsai et al., 2007),phytol (3) (Itoh et al., 2003), and alpha kosin (5) (Woldemariamet al., 1992) were identified by comparison of their physical andspectroscopic data with literature reports.Compound 4 was obtained as an oily liquid from a variety ofchromatographic separations. The IR spectrum (KBr) exhibitedabsorption bands at 3417 and 3300 (corresponding to twohydroxyl groups) along with other absorption bands at 2954and 2849 cm1. Elemental analysis (Found: C, 77.21%; H, 12.93%/requires: C, 77.24%; H, 12.96%) in combination with 21 carbonsresonance and a molecular ion peak [M+H]+ observed at m/z327.3021 in positive mode of EI-MS, established the molecularformula to be C21H42O2. A peak at 295.2727 appeared due to loss of[M-CH2OH] moiety.1H NMR spectrum (200 MHz in CDCl3) ofcompound 4 exhibited the signal of H-2 at d 5.39 (J = 8) vicinallycoupled to the two protons doublet on C-1 at d 4.15 (J = 8) andallylically to the protons on C-4 and the vinyl methyl (C-21). Themethylene protons doublet at d 4.15 (J = 8) showed correlationwith an olefinic proton d 5.39 in 1H–1H COSY experiment suggestedthe presence of a double bond between C-2 and C-3. In 13C NMRspectrum (50 MHz, CDCl3) of compound 4, the two carbonresonance signals observed at d 141.2 and 123.9 were evidencedfor olefinic carbon positioned at C-3 and C-2, respectively. Thechemical shift values corresponding to protons and olefin methylgroup attached to respective hetero-nuclear carbons wereevidenced on the basis of HSQC spectrum. In HMBC spectrum,the proton H-2 was found to be correlated to C-3, Similarly, H-2showed connectivity to C-4 and C-17. Also, the correlations wereobserved between olefin methyl protons at d 1.65 to C-2 and C-4.On the basis of identical chemical shift values as well as in DEPTand HMBC signals, compound 4 was found to be almost related tocompound 3. The cross-signals in the proton spectrum showed atwo proton triplet at d 3.62 (J = 6) and a carbon spectrum signalwhich appeared at d 63.9 evidenced a hydroxyl group bearingcarbon. The protons appeared at d 3.62 were found stronglyattached to the carbon signal at d 63.9 as evidenced in the HSQCTable 1Antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of ethanol extract of L. sericea and isolaTest samples Antibacterial MICmg/mL/(mM)AnmgL.sericea 15.6 MF 1–5, 7–9, 11–14, 17–20 NaaMF 6 500 MF 10 1.9 MF 15, 16 31.3 1 (phytol acetate) Na >12 (triacontanol) Na >13 (phytol) Na >14 ((E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylheptadec-2-ene-1,17-diol) Na >15 (alpha kosin) 1.9/(2.1) PCd 3.1/(7) aNot active at the highest concentration tested (500 mg/mL).bNot applicable.cNot tested due to low yield.dPositive drug controls; tetracycline for antibacterial, vitamin C for antioxidant, actinospectrum. The proton H-17 at d 3.62 was found to be correlatedwith C-15 in hetero-nuclear multiple bond coherence. Hence, anew phytol analogue (E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylheptadec-2-ene-1,17-diol, was identified from the combined spectral analysis ofcompound 4 (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge this is the newcompound which has been isolated first time from the plant L.sericea.2.2. Antibacterial bioassayThe antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of L. sericea andisolated compounds have been summarised in Table 1. The ethanolextract of L. sericea inhibited the bacterial growth and exhibitednoteworthy MIC value of 15.6 mg/mL. Compound 5 was found to bethe most active compound against P. acnes with MIC value of1.9 mg/mL as compared to tetracycline (positive control) with MICvalue of 3.1 mg/mL. It is worth noting that threshold MIC values of100 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL have been recommended for plantextracts and pure compounds, respectively, to rate them as havingsignificant antimicrobial activity (Kuete, 2010). Thus the MICvalues measured for the activity of crude extract and compound 5can be considered significant. Compounds 1–4 did not show anygrowth inhibitory activities at highest concentration tested(500 mg/mL). To the best of our knowledge, the antibacterialactivity of L. sericea and isolated compounds (1–5) against P. acnesis being reported for the first time. However, petroleum ether anddichloromethane leaves extract of L. sericea was found to be activeagainst Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively,with MIC value of 0.025 mg/mL (Aremu et al., 2010). In the presentstudy no activity for compounds 2 and 3 was found. Contrary tothis, in a study, compound 3 exhibited activity against Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium with MIC values of2 mg/mL and 16 mg/mL, respectively (Rugutt and Rugutt, 2012);and compound 2 showed antibacterial activity against Escherichiacoli, S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and Lactobacillus acidophilus with MICvalues ranging between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL (Upadhyay et al.,2010). Based on the literature search, no antimicrobial activity ofcompounds 1 and 5 was found.2.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)For microscopy studies, the plant extract and compound 5which showed activity against the bacteria were selected. The TEMmicrograph represents clear differences between untreated andtreated P. acnes.

A centrally locatednucleoid surrounded by ribosomes was observed (Fig. 2a). The TEMmicrograph showed cell injuries caused to P. acnes on exposure tothe ethanol extract of L. sericea for 72 h. P. acnes treated with theethanol extract of L. sericea at a concentration of 100 mg/mLexhibited abnormal changes in cell content material, whereas athigher concentration of 300 mg/mL, the cell wall of bacteria wasfound lysed and cell debris was observed (Fig. 2b and c). Compound5 caused significant damage to the cells of P. acnes at aconcentration of 50 mg/mL. The intracellular content was foundto be effluxed due to breaks in the cell wall. The intact cells showedchanges in the appearance of cell organelles. Due to extensive lysisof the bacteria, the debris was observed all over (Fig. 2d).Tetracycline treated bacteria at a concentration of 50 mg/mL,caused significant damages to the cells of P. acnes, leading todamages in the cell membrane, distortion in the cell structure andshrinkage of cell content material (Fig. 2e). Treating P. acnes withDMSO at 2.5% exhibited no lethal effects to bacteria (Fig. 2f). TheTEM micrograph confirms the antibacterial activity of L. sericea andcompound 5 against P. acnes.2.4. Antioxidant assayDPPH assay provides antiradical properties of the samples. Theantioxidants are able to stable the free DPPH radical due to theirproton donating ability.

Sharma et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 7 (2014) 124–129 127extract and compound 5 on DPPH increased with their increasingconcentrations. These samples showed very significant antioxidantactivity with IC50 values very similar to vitamin C, a widely usedantioxidant compound. The results are shown in Table 1. The mgvitamin C equivalents/g dry weight for compound 5 was calculatedto be 392. Compounds 1–4 did not show any antioxidant activity.Concerning the structure–activity relationship, it was clear that thepresence of four free hydroxyl groups in compound 5 could beresponsible for its antioxidant activity in comparison withcompounds 1–4 which possesses less or lacks any free hydroxylgroups. Similar to our results, it has been reported that themethanol extract of the leaves of L. sericea exhibited antioxidantactivity with IC50 value of 3.0 mg/mL. However, petroleum etherand DCM extract exhibited a higher IC50 value of 26.2 mg/mL and27.7 mg/mL, respectively (Aremu et al., 2010). To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first report of DPPH scavenging activity of allthe compounds isolated in this study.2.5. In vitro cytotoxicity assayThe cytotoxicity of the extracts and compounds 2, 3 and 5 wasdone on B16-F10 mouse melanocytes and U937 human macro-phage cells. The cytotoxicity analysis of compounds 1 and 4 wasnot conducted due to unavailability of sufficient amount of thesamples. All the results are listed in Table 1. To the best of ourknowledge, the cytotoxicity in the present study of the ethanolextract of L. sericea and three isolated compounds against B16-F10mouse melanocytes and U937 human macrophage cells isreported for the first time. L. sericea exhibited moderate toxicityon B16-F10 cells and comparatively higher toxicity on U937 cells.Compound 5 showed significant toxicity on both the cell lineswith EC50 value of <3.12 mg/mL. However, compounds 2 and 3 didnot exhibit any toxicity on both the cell lines with 100% viability ofcells at their highest concentration of 100 mg/mL. Similar to ourfindings, strong cytotoxic effects of compound 5 against MACtumour cells with EC50 value of 1.5 mg/mL was reported byWoldemariam et al. (1992). Compound 2 was reported as non-toxic constituent of Viburnum jucundum (Rios et al., 2001).Compound 3 showed toxicity against skin cancer cells (SK-MEL-2), CNS cancer cells (XF498) and colorectal cancer cells (HCT15)with EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 11.2 mg/mL (Sung et al.,1999). No reports in the literature about the cell toxicity have beenfound for L. sericea.2.6. Anti-inflammatory activityP. acnes stimulate macrophages for increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL 8 and TNF a which contributesto the induction of mediators of inflammatory response. In thepresent study, IL 8 and TNF a were used as major criteria forevaluation of anti-inflammatory activity. The U937 cells co-cultured with P. acnes caused an increase in the production of IL8 and TNF a (Fig. 3a). To test the anti-inflammatory effects of L.sericea, an in vitro screening at three nontoxic concentrations wereapplied. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ethanol extract of L. sericeadecreased the production of IL 8 and TNF a in dose-dependentmanner. Furthermore, the plant extract did not increase thesecretion of either of the cytokines in culture of U937 cells in theabsence of heat killed P. acnes (data not shown). Pentoxifyllinewhich was used as a control behaves differently on the cytokines.Based on the previous reports, it down regulated the secretion ofTNF a and caused no change in IL 8 release (D’Hellencourt et al.,1996). As shown in Fig. 3b, our results were in agreement withother researchers. Significant inhibition of TNF a was observed at100 and 50 mg/mL of pentoxifylline, whereas no change in IL 8concentration was observed. To the best of our knowledge, noreports about L. sericea in context with suppression of cytokineswere found. Although, similar to our results, other plants, i.e.Eucommia ulmoides and Ilex paraguariensis extracts were reportedto reduce the secretion of IL 8 and TNF a in human monocytic THP-1 cells pre-treated with P. acnes at concentration of 0.1 mg/mL(Tsai et al., 2010).R.

All the cell lines andmedium (Highveld Biological Pty Ltd., Johannesburg). Elisa kit andreagents (BD Biosciences, Johannesburg). All the chemicals werepurchased from Sigma–Aldrich and Merck SA Pty Ltd.3.2. Plant materialThe twigs and leaves of L. sericea were collected from thebotanical garden of University of Pretoria, Pretoria, in March 2011.A voucher specimen (PRU 119052) was deposited at H.G.W.J.Schwelckerdt Herbarium, Department of Plant Science, Universityof Pretoria, Pretoria.3.3. Extraction and isolationThe air-dried and powdered leaves (2.3 kg) were soaked in 9 Lof ethanol for 3 days at room temperature. The filtrates werecollected and concentrated under reduced pressure by a rotavaporat 40 8C to produce 73 g of crude ethanol extract. About 60 g of theethanolic extract of L. sericea was subjected to silica gel columnchromatography (70 cm  120 cm) with hexane fraction (Hex):ethyl acetate (EtOAc) mixtures of increasing polarity (100:0–0:100) followed by 100% methanol (MeOH) as eluent. In total 51fractions (500 mL) were collected and similar fractions werecombined according to thin-layer (TLC) profile, which resulted into20 major fractions (MF). All the 20 major fractions were tested forantibacterial activity using broth dilution method against patho-genic P. acnes. The results are shown in Table 1. Fractions 6, 10, 15and 16 showed inhibitory activity against P. acnes; hence weresubjected further to chromatographic columns to isolate thebioactive compounds. MF 6 (600 mg) was separated on a silica gelcolumn eluted with Hex: dichloromethane (DCM) mixtures ofincreasing polarity (100:0–0:100) which yielded twenty-three subfractions (Sf). Sf 3–5 led to the isolation of compound 1 (6 mg,0.01%), Sf 7–8 eluted compound 2 (10 mg, 0.02%) and Sf 9–12 led tothe separation of compound 3 (9 mg, 0.02%) and compound 4(8 mg, 0.01%) was obtained from Sf 13–14. The separation of MF 10(1.4 g) was done using silica gel column chromatography elutingwith mixture of Hex: (DCM:MeOH: 99:1) in equal ratio, whichyielded forty-six Sf. Sf 4 and 5 were combined according to TLCanalysis, consequently compound 5 (34 mg, 0.06%) was obtained.Further, MF 15 and 16 (2.3 g) were combined based on TLC profileand were separated similar to MF 10, which yielded one hundredand forty Sf. From the Sf 46–51, compound 5 (15 mg, 0.03%) wasobtained for the second time.3.4.

Antibacterial bioassayThe ethanol extract and compounds were tested against P. acnesby determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)values obtained by a broth dilution method as previously describedby Mapunya et al. (2011) with few modifications. Briefly, thebacteria were cultured from a Kwik–Stick on nutrient agar andincubated at 37 8C for 72 h under anaerobic conditions before theassay. The 72 h culture of the bacteria was dissolved in nutrientbroth and the suspension was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standardturbidity. This resulted in 105–106 colony forming units (CFU)/mL.In a sterile 96-well plate, 100 mL of samples from the stock solutionconsisting of the plant extract/isolated compounds (2 mg/mL in10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)) and the positive controltetracycline (0.2 mg/mL) was diluted with broth. Twofold serialdilutions were made in broth over a range to give concentrations of500–3.9 and 50–0.3 mg/mL for the plant extract/isolated com-pounds and positive control tetracycline, respectively. Thebacterial suspension (100 mL) was added to the wells. The wellswith 2.5% DMSO and bacterial suspension without samples servedas the solvent and negative controls, respectively. The plates wereincubated at 37 8C for 72 h in an anaerobic environment. The MICvalue was determined by observing colour change in the wellsafter addition of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl(INT) (defined as the lowest concentration that showed nobacterial growth).3.6. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)The TEM procedures followed the protocol of a previouspublication (Pan et al., 2009). Briefly, bacterial was concentrated bycentrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 1 min. The pellet was resus-pended in nutrient broth to a final OD550 nm of 1. Theconcentrations of plant extract were 1.3 and 4 times of its MIC;and 5 times of MIC for pure compound in order to visualise thelethal effects of tested samples against bacteria. The bacterialsuspension (5 mL) was mixed with plant extract and purecompound to a final concentration of 300 and 100 mg/mL forplant extracts and 50 mg/mL for pure compound. Tetracycline(50 mg/mL) and DMSO (2.5%) were used as positive and solventcontrol. The pathogen was treated for 72 h; the control groupconsisted of only bacterial suspension in nutrient broth. Controls,treated and untreated P. acnes cultures were centrifuged and fixedin 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer at room temperaturefor 1 h. Samples were washed with phosphate buffer and postfixedin both 1% osmium tetraoxide and uranyl acetate. The cells weredehydrated in ethanol and embedded in quetol resin. Thin sectionswere prepared with a microtome and micrographs were takenusing a JEOL JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope.3.7. Antioxidant assayAntioxidant activity of the ethanol extract of L. sericea andpurified compounds was investigated using 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant assay. Following the proceduresas described by Du Toit et al. (2001) for each sample, a dilutionseries (8 dilutions) was prepared in a 96 well plate by addingdistilled water as a dilution medium. Final concentration of thesamples ranged from 100 to 0.7 mg/mL. Each concentration wasR. Sharma et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 7 (2014) 124–129 129tested in triplicates. Vitamin C was used as a positive control. Theradical scavenging capacities of the samples were determinedusing a BIOTEK plate reader to measure the disappearance of DPPHat 550 nm. The radical scavenging activity was measured in termsof the amount of antioxidants necessary to decrease the initialDPPH absorbance by 50% (IC50). The IC50 value of each sample wasdetermined graphically by plotting the absorbance of DPPH as afunction of the sample concentration in mg/mL. The IC50 is theamount of antioxidant necessary to decrease the initial DPPHabsorbance by 50%. The results were calculated using the followingequation:AA% ¼AbsblankðAbssample  AbscontrolÞAbsblank  100The mg vitamin C equivalents/g dry weight of potent sampleswas calculated as follows:VitEACðmg AA=100 gÞ ¼ IC50ðvit cÞIC50ðsampleÞ  10003.8. In vitro cytotoxicity assayThe mouse melanocytes (B16-F10) cells were cultured in acomplete Minimum Essential Eagle’s Medium (MEM), whereas thehuman U937 cells were cultured in Roswell Park MemorialInstitute (RPMI) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%gentamycin. B16-F10 (105 cells per well) and U937 (106 cells perwell) were seeded into a 96-well plate. After an overnightincubation at 37 8C in 5% CO2 and a humidified atmosphere, theextract, compounds and the positive control (actinomycin D) wereadded to the cells. The final concentrations of plant extract andpure compounds were ranging from 400 to 3.13 mg/mL and 100 to1.5 mg/mL, respectively. The highest concentration of positivecontrol (0.05 mg/mL) was serially diluted to eight consecutivewells. The plate was then incubated at 37 8C in 5% CO2, and ahumidified atmosphere after which the toxicity effects of theextracts was assayed using the XTT (sodium 30-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitrobenzene sul-fonic acid hydrate) cytotoxicity assay. Fifty micro litres of XTTreagent (1 mg/mL XTT with 0.383 mg/mL PMS) was added to thewells and incubated for 1 h. The optical densities of the wells weremeasured at 450 nm (690 nm reference wavelength) using BIOTEKPower-wave XS multi well reader (A.D.P., Weltevreden Park, SouthAfrica). By referring to the control (medium with DMSO), the cellsurvival rate was assessed. The ‘Graph Pad Prism 4’, statisticalprogramme was used to analyse the 50% inhibitory concentration(EC50) values.3.9. Preparation of heat-killed P. acnes and measurement of cytokineproductionThe effect of plant extract on cytokine production (IL 8 and TNFa) was evaluated using enzyme immunoassay kits (ELISA) usingmethod as described previously (Tsai et al., 2010). Briefly, the logphase culture of P. acnes was harvested, washed three times withphosphate buffer saline (PBS), and incubated at 80 8C for 30 min tokill the bacteria. The heat-killed bacteria were stored at 4 8C untiluse. The human U937 cells were seeded at 106 cells per well in a24-well plate and was stimulated with heat killed P. acnes (wetweight 100 mg/mL) alone and in combination with the differenttest samples. Pentoxifylline was used as a control. After 18 hincubation, the cell-free supernatants were collected and theconcentrations of IL 8 and TNF a were analysed. Cytokinestandards were serially diluted to facilitate the construction ofcalibration curves necessary for determining protein concentrationof test samples.Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank University of Pretoria and National ResearchFoundation for the financial grants.ReferencesAremu, A.O., Fawole, O.A., Chukwujekwu, J.C., Light, M.E., Finnie, J.F., Van Staden, J.,2010.
