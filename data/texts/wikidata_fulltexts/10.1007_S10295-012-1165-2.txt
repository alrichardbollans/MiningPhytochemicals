Abstract The biotransformation of the sesquiterpene
lactone tagitinin C by the fungus Aspergillus terreus MT
5.3 yielded a rare derivative that was elucidated by spec-
trometric methods. The fungus led to the formation of a
different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction
between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge,
and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitinin C. The chemical
structure of the product, namely 1b-methoxy-3a-hydroxy-
3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en-
6a,12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was
recently isolated from the flowers of a Brazilian population
of Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia), which is the
source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic
activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product
were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and
both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that
soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of ses-
quiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in
their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their
biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic
pathways for production of secondary metabolites.

Introduction
Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are a large group of natural
products found mainly in plants of the family Asteraceae.
They are considered chemical markers within the family
and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37].
Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological
activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and
antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active con-
stituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae world-
wide [32].
Tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in
the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inflorescences of
Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsl. A. Gray,
Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inflammatory
[33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising
compound for further research into its mechanisms of
action in different targets. T. diversifolia, the source of 1, is
used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has

anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties [8]. How-
ever, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of
STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting
approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower
toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or
both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic
synthetic methods is not always a straightforward proce-
dure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs
is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose
effects should be investigated [20].
The biotransformation of organic compounds by
microorganisms is considered an economically and eco-
logically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool
for the structural modification of bioactive natural products
and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16].
Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a
similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial
systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in
humans has received considerable attention [7, 16].
Fungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs
have been carried out to obtain modifications that enhance
activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure–
activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to
predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable
number of biotransformations of STLs have been described
using fungi [29]. Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888), for
example, transformed costunolide into four main products,
1b-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine,
and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, A. och-
raceous (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two
products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial
transformation of sclareolide by A. niger (ATCC 10549)
yielded four oxidized metabolites identified as 1b-hydrox-
ysclareolide, 3b-hydroxysclareolide, 1a,3b-dihydroxyscla-
reolide, and 1b,3b-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL
artemisitene was metabolized by A. niger (NRRL 599) to
yield 11-epi-artemisinin, 9b-hydroxydeoxy-11-epi-arte-
misinin, and 9b-hydroxy-11-epi-artemisinin [27]. Microbial
transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using
A. niger (NRRL 599) and A. ochraceous (NRRL 2295) yiel-
ded 11bH-dihydroparthenolide [11]. A. terreus (IFO6123)
transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives,
11a,13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1-
propenyl)eremantholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of
A. niger (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of
the most important STLs, artemisinin, into four hydroxylated
products, 3b-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1a-hydroxyartemisi-
nin, 5b-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7b-hydroxyartemisinin
[28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic
reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by Aspergillus

species are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and
acetylation.
Thus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bio-
active compounds, and giving insights into the new meta-
bolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the
biotransformation of tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) by the fungus
Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3.
Materials and methods
Isolation of tagitinin C (1)
Leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (400 g) were collected by
B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil. The
material was identified by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher
specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Depart-
ment of Biology, Ribeira˜o Preto, SP, University of Sa˜o
Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves
were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for
dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding
5 g of a yellow crude extract after filtration with common
filter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pres-
sure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O
(7:3, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane followed by
dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloro-
methane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck,
Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9]
using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in n-hexane,
thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagi-
tinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, confirmed by
infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC
analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample
[2]) were purified by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel
PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness;
n-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; flow
rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For final purification,
preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil,
cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; n-hexane/ethyl acetate/
chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The
isolated compound (1, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and
1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before
the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data
of compounds (1 and 2) were in accordance with those
reported [2].
Biotransformation procedure and analysis
Screening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fer-
mentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks) to select
efficient conditions for the biotransformation of 1. The
trials for screening procedures were performed as previ-
ously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. A. terreus
MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incu-
bated at 30 C for 7 days to obtain spores. After that,
the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous
solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The
pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 9 107
spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 C
for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed
with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek med-
ium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under
the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of
1, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulf-
oxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ll), was added to the culture
medium. Control flasks contained culture medium with the
fungus but without 1, culture medium with the fungus and
dimethyl sulfoxide and without 1, culture medium with 1
and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time
course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer
flask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with
dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the
degree of transformation of compound 1. TLC was carried
out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates
(0.25 mm thickness, 20 9 20 cm), and the spots were
visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric
acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol).
Thirty milligrams of 1 was used for the preparative-
scale incubation with A. terreus MT 5.3 for 120 h, at
150 rpm, and 30 C. The culture broth was filtered using
filter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The
organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the
solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting
residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in
a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an
SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a
C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 lm,
4.6 9 250 mm; flow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection).
The main metabolite (2, 4 mg) was purified after repe-
ated injections according to the following gradient:
0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min
100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 %
MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds 1 and 2
were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min,
respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison
of the HPLC profiles of the controls with those bio-
transformed ensured that 1 had been converted to 2
through microbial catalysis.
The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined
by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and com-
parison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample
and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a
Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for
1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with
tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents
were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass

spectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA).
Microorganism
Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato
Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identified by C. M. S.
Motta from ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas–Micoteca URM–Depart-
amento de Micologia/CCB-UFP’’, Av. Prof. Nelson
Chaves s/no., Cidade Universita´ria, 50670-420, Recife,
Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on
PDA at 8 C.
The microorganism A. terreus MT 5.3 was deposited in
the collection ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas Tropicais’’ (Tropical
Culture Collection) of Andre´ Tosello Foundation (www.
fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640.
Cytotoxicity assay
Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma,
USA) solution at a final concentration of 500 lg/ml was
added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the
treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of
100 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell
treatment we used compounds 1 and 2, at concentrations of
5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 lg/ml. Non-
treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and
cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statis-
tical analysis was performed by Student’s t test; and
Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons. A
p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM.
Results and discussion
The transformation of 1 by A. terreus MT 5.3 yielded the
unusual STL 2 as the main compound. This was identified
as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobuty-
royloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6a,12-olide. The 1H NMR
spectral data of 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1. Although
several researchers worldwide have chemically investi-
gated T. diversifolia, compound 2 was isolated only from a
Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should
be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that
Aspergillus promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydrox-
ylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27,
29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unu-
sual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was
added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the
10-membered ring of 1. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double
bond at C11–C13 was preserved. Compound 2 was
recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inflorescences
of Brazilian T. diversifolia [2]. Although its chemical
structure is already known, this is the first time that 2 has
been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An
interesting observation is that the Aspergillus strain used in
our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that
mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes
from the inflorescences of T. diversifolia. Glandular tric-
homes of Asteraceae species are the places where the
biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where 1
is converted to 2. Thus, this fungus can be used as an
alternative means of gaining 2 from 1, therefore confirming
the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by
microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant
biosynthetic pathways [34].
Spring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely
related analogue of 1 from Viguiera quinqueremis (Aster-
aceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form,
such as 1b depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences
between the previously reported analogue and 1 are the
nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of
isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15.
The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of
the 1a analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby
leading to the formation of an analogue of 1b (Fig. 1) [38].
Thus, it could be argued in our work that 2 is a compound
produced by A. terreus starting from 1b, an artifact that had

originated from 1 in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless,
a spontaneous interconversion where 1 was converted to 1b
would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH
was not used in any step of the experimental procedure,
either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of 1.
Compound 2 is therefore a natural product obtained by
biotransformation of 1. In addition, the crude extract from
the leaves of T. diversifolia used in this work had been
screened for the presence of 2 by HPLC–DAD analysis,
and it was not detected even as a trace.
According to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydro-
genation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11–
C13 seem to be the most common processes in the
microbial transformation of STLs by filamentous fungi. In
order to explain the formation of the epoxide group
between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule 2 as
well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal
of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids
are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi,
thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane
and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and
co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water
soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in
this process of detoxification are comparable to those of
other eukaryotic cells. In the first step, monooxygenases of
cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the
molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water-
soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or
conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the
biotransformation of 1 leading to 2 might be part of a
detoxification process created by the fungus.
The cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe
whether 1 and 2 could elicit cell death at the selected
concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects
on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive
control, which was statistically significant when compared
with the negative control (p \ 0.05). The results indicated
that 1 and 2 have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at
the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where 1 and 2
also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non-
selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that 1 has
cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity
has not yet been compared with that of the derivative 2. In
the same work, compound 1b was isolated from T. diver-
sifolia as a natural compound and was found to be
approximately 10 times more active than 1. In our work,
compound 2, a C4–C5 epoxy derivative of 1b, had a sta-
tistically similar activity to 1.
Kupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro
cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was
dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-c-lactone
moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of
further derivatives indicated which functional groups con-
tributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups
have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been
verified, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety
contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the
a-methylene-c-lactone group, whereas the compounds
containing only this additional unsaturation did not present
significant activity [18]. In another study, it was confirmed
that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b-
unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone
and a-methylene-c-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity
[36]. In our work, compound 1, containing three a,b-
unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to 2,
with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested
therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to
the effect observed in HL-60 cells.
In summary, we have observed that in the presence of
compound 1, enzymes from A. terreus MT 5.3 were able to
generate 2 in the same way as the enzymes located in the
glandular trichomes of T. diversifolia. This fungus can thus
be used as an alternative source of 2 because it mimics
plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b-
unsaturations in 2 did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic
activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with 1. Finally,
we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of 1 after oral
consumption of preparations containing T. diversifolia
leaves should be researched in future, because this STL
may form toxic compounds when metabolized.
