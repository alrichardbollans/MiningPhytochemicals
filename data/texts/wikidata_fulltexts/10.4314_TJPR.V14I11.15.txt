Abstract 
Purpose: To isolate and characterize chemical compounds of biological importance from the whole 
plant of Dendrobium hongdie. 
Methods: The whole plants of Dendrobium hongdie was extracted with ethanol (EtOH) and separated 
using silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 and MCI gel to isolate the pure compounds. Characterization of the 
isolated compounds was achieved using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 
and mass spectrometry (MS). 
Results: Nine compounds including two phenanthrenes, three bibenzyls, a phenanthraquinone, two 
lignans and a sterol were isolated from the extract. The structures of the compounds were elucidated as 
nudol (1), gigantol (2), batatasin III (3), tristin (4), moscatin (5), ephemeranthoquinone (6), (-)-
syringaresinol (7), liriodendrin (8) and β-sitosterol (9).  
Conclusion: Nine compounds have been successfully isolated from D. hongdie for the first time. This 
plant is a potential source of some useful phytochemicals.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Stilbenoids such as phenanthrenes, bibenzyls, 
and phenanthraquinones are regarded as 
important secondary metabolites occurring 
exclusively in the plants of Orchidaceae, which 
was distributed in tropical and subtropical areas 
and consist of about 700 genus and 20000 
species [1]. The genus Dendrobium is 
represented by more than 1100 species widely 
distributed throughout Asia, Europe, and 
Australia, and there are about 80 species of 
Dendrobium in China. The stems of a number of 
Dendrobium species was used as precious 
healthy foods and nutrients in traditional Chinese 
medicine [2]. Previous phytochemical 
investigations on the plants of Dendrobium 
genus  such as D. nobile, D. crysotoxum and D. 
densiflorum,  have led to the isolation of 
bibenzyls, phenanthrenes, alkaloids, 
polysaccharides, fluorenones, sesquiterpenes, 
coumarins and others, mainly bibenzyls and 
phenanthrenes, with antitumor, antimutagenic, 
immunomodulatory, antioxidant and platelet 
aggregation inhibitory activities [3-7]. D. hongdie 
was a hybrid of D. nobile and D. phalaenopsis 
developed by Yunnan Inmol Laboratory of 
Technology, China. Previously there was no 
report on its chemical constituents. In the course 
of our search for bioactive natural products from 
medicinal plants in Yunnan of China, we 
investigated the plant. From the whole plants of

D. hongdie, nine compounds including two 
phenanthrenes, three bibenzyls, one 
phenanthraquinone, two lignans and a sterol 
were isolated and their structures were identified 
by 1H-, 13C-NMR and MS spectrum.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL  
 
Plant material 
 
The whole plant of D. hongdie was collected from 
Yunnan Inmol Laboratory of Technology, 
Kunming, China and identified by one of the 
authors, Prof. Hong Yu (School of Life Science, 
Yunnan University, Kunming, China). 
 
Extraction 
 
The air-dried powdered whole plants (4 kg) were 
exhaustively extracted with 95 % EtOH six times 
at room temperature (each for 24 h). The extract 
obtained was concentrated to dryness under 
reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator to yield 
the EtOH extract (180 g, 4.5 %), which was 
dissolved in water (1 L) and extracted with CHCl3 
and EtOAc successively to yield CHCl3 (65 g, 
1.62 %), EtOAc (30 g, 0.75 %) and water soluble 
fractions (90 g, 2.25 %). 
 
Isolation of compounds 
 
Silica gel (200-300 mesh, Qingdao Marine 
Chemical Co., China), Sephadex LH-20 (25-100 
μm, Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd.) and MCI 
gel CHP 20P (75-150 μm, Mitsubishi Chemical 
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were used for 
column chromatography (CC), and silica gel 
GF254 was used for TLC (Qingdao Marine 
Chemical Co., China). Solvents were of industrial 
purity and re-distilled prior to use.

The CHCl3  soluble fraction (65 g) was separated 
on a silica gel column, eluting with petroleum 
ether containing increasing amounts of EtOAc 
(1:0, 20:1, 10:1, 8:1, 8:2, 7;3, 1:1) to obtain 7 
fractions. Fraction 2 (6 g, eluted with petroleum 
ether/acetone 20:1) was subjected to column 
chromatography on silica gel (petroleum 
ether/acetone 10:1, v/v portion) to yield 9 (150 
mg). Fraction 3 (5 g, eluted with petroleum 
ether/acetone 10:1) was subjected to column 
chromatography using MeOH/CHCl3 (2:3) on 
Sephadex LH-20 to yield 2 (2 g), 3 (16 mg) and 6 
(8 mg). Fraction 4 (3.5 g, eluted with petroleum 
ether/acetone 8:1) was chromatographied using 
MeOH/CHCl3 (2:3) and Sephadex LH-20 to 
obtain 1 (30 mg) and 5 (25 mg). Similarly, 
fraction 5 (1.3 g, eluted with petroleum 
ether/acetone 8:2) was purified over Sephadex 
LH-20 using MeOH/CHCl3 (2:3) to yield 4 (30 
mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction (30 g) was 
separated on silica gel column, eluting with 
CHCl3/acetone 8:2 to produce 7 (100 mg). The 
water soluble phase after extraction with EtOAc 
was subjected on a MCI chromatography, eluting 
with water with increasing amounts of MeOH (0 
%, 50 %, 90 %, 100 %) to furnish 3 fractions. The 
50 % MeOH fraction (28 g) was applied on a 
column chromatography (silica gel, gradient 
CHCl3/MeOH) (1:0,20:1, 10:1, 8:1, 8:2, 7:3, 0:1) 
to yield 8 (300 mg). 
 
Identification of compounds 
 
Identification of compounds was carried out 
using mass spectroscopy (MS, API Qstar Pulsa 
LC/TOF mass spectrometer,) and 1H-, 13C-NMR 
spectra on Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer.

DISCUSSION 
 
Some compounds have been isolated from the 
plants of Orchidaceae which usually contain 
stilbenoids such as phenanthrenes and bibenzyls 
as characteristic compounds. Some of the 
isolated compounds have been found to show 
significant anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and 
platelet anti-aggregation activities. In the present 
study, nine compounds have been isolated from 
the EtOH extract of the whole plants of D. 
hongdie. Detailed analysis of the 1H and 13C 
NMR showed that their structures were 
phenanthrenes nudol (1) and moscatin (5), 
bibenzyls gigantol (2), batatasin III (3) and tristin 
(4), phenanthraquinone ephemeranthoquinone 
(6), lignans (-)-syringaresinol (7) and liriodendrin 
(8) and sterol β-sitosterol (9) respectively. All the 
compounds were isolated from D. hongdie for the 
first time. Some of the isolated compounds have 
been evaluated for biological properties and 
significant results were reported. Examples are 
the inhibition of ephemeranthoquinone on the 
spontaneous contraction of the guinea-pig ileum, 
spasmolytic, allelopathic and inhibitory activities 
of batatasin III on germination and radicle 
growth, and cytotoxicity of tristin against human 
stomach cancer SGC-7901 [6,14-19]. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Nine compounds namely, two phenanthrenes, 
three bibenzyls, one phenanthraquinone, two 
lignans and a sterol have been isolated from the 
whole plants of D. hongdie for the first time, and 
their structures were elucidated as nudol (1), 
gigantol (2), batatasin III (3), tristin (4), moscatin 
(5), ephemeranthoquinone (6), (-)-syringaresinol 
(7), liriodendrin (8) and β-sitosterol (9). The 
results provided some understanding on the 
chemical constituents of the plant and also 
showed that the plant could be a potential source 
of some useful phytochemicals.
