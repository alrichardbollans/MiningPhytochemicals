The coffee diterpenes cafestol and kahweol raise serum cholesterol in humans. Each 10 mg of cafestol 
consumed per day elevates cholesterol by 5 mg/dL (0.13 mmol/L). Diterpene levels in various coffee 
brews were examined. Scandinavian boiled coffee contained (mean f SD) 3.0 f 2.8 mg, French 
press coffee 3.5 f 1.2 mg, and TurkisWGreek coffee 3.9 f 3.2 mg of cafestol per cup. Consumption 
of five cups per day of any of these coffee types could thus elevate serum cholesterol by 8-10 mgl 
dL. Italian espresso coffee contained 1.5 f 1.0 mg of cafestol per cup, five cups theoretically raising 
cholesterol by 4 mg/dL. Brewing time had little effect of diterpenes. Brewing strength increased 
diterpenes in boiled, French press, and espresso coffee but not in TurkisWGreek coffee. Diterpenes 
in instant, drip filtered, and percolated brews were negligible. Regular and decaffeinated coffees 
had similar diterpene contents. High chronic intake of French press coffee or TurkisldGreek coffee 
could increase serum cholesterol and thus coronary risk similar to that reported previously for 
Scandinavian boiled coffee.

INTRODUCTION 
Scandinavian-type boiled coffee raises serum choles- 
terol in man (Aro, 1993; Thelle et al., 1987). The 
diterpenes cafestol and, possibly, kahweol are respon- 
sible for this effect (Heckers et al., 1994; Weusten-van 
der Wouw et al., 1994). Additionally, cafestol and 
kahweol affect liver fbnction; they increased the activity 
of alanine aminotransferase and depressed that of 
y-glutamyltransferase in serum. In controlled trials, 
serum cholesterol rose by about 1 mg/dL (0.03 mmoVL) 
and alanine aminotransferase by about 1 unit& for each 
extra 2 mg of cafestol ingested (Weusten-van der Wouw 
et al., 1994). Levels of cafestol and kahweol in various 
coffee brews could be used to predict their capacity to 
affect lipoprotein metabolism and liver function and are 
thus an important health issue. 
Cafestol and kahweol represent the major part of the 
unsaponifiable lipid fraction in coffee beans. They are 
mainly present as fatty acid esters, but small amounts 
of free alcohols also occur. The total diterpene content 
is 1.3% w/w in green beans of Coffea arubica (commonly 
called Arabica beans) and 0.2% in beans of Coffea 
cunephoru (commonly called Robusta beans) (IARC 
Working Group, 1991). Robusta beans are almost 
devoid of kahweol (Viani, 1988) but contain a third 
diterpene-16-0-methylcafestol-which is absent in Ara- 
bica beans (Speer and Mischnick, 1989). Other diter- 
penes, such as decomposition products of cafestol and 
kahweol, are present in very low quantities and are 
therefore unlikely to affect serum lipids and liver 
enzymes substantially. 
Brewing releases oil droplets containing diterpenes 
from ground coffee beans. They are retained by a paper 
filter (Ratnayake et al., 1993), which explains why 
paper-filtered coffee shows no (Ahola et al., 1991; van

effect on serum cholesterol. With espresso and mocha 
coffee, and with French press coffee, also known as 
plunger or cafetiere coffee, lipids readily pass the metal 
filter (Ratnayake et al., 1993) and the hypercholester- 
olemic diterpenes may thus be removed less efficiently 
from the brew. .Other brews, such as Scandinavian 
boiled coffee and Middle Eastern coffee types, are 
decanted directly from the boiling state into the cup 
without applying a filter at all (IARC Working Group, 
1991). 
We report diterpene contents of various coffee brews 
and their potential impact on serum cholesterol levels. 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Collection of Field Samples. Boiled coffee was collected 
from regular consumers in Norway and Finland (n = 14); 
TurkisWGreek coffee was collected from Turkish and Greek 
restaurants operated by immigrants in the Netherlands (n = 
7) and from retail outlets in Greece and Egypt (n = 4). 
Espresso was from bars and restaurants in Italy (n = lo), 
Spain (n = 2), Switzerland (n = 4), and the Netherlands (n = 
15). French press coffee (Figure 1) was obtained from consum- 
ers in the Netherlands (n = 5). Brews were poured into plastic 
containers so as to mimic the amount of the brew that is 
consumed from the cup and frozen at -20 "C. Cup size was 
defined as the amount poured into the container.
