The present study aims to identify the bioactive fractionsand ingredients in SWH that account for its osteoprotective effects. Bilateral sham-operated mice acted as controls. OVX C57BL/6J mice,aged 12 weeks, were orally administrated daily with vehicle or 17b-oestradiol (3·2 mg/kg), SWH (60 % ethanol crude extract; 1·0 g/kg), SWA(water eluate; 0·570 g/kg), SWB (30 % ethanol eluate; 0·128 g/kg) or SWC (50 and 95 % ethanol eluates; 0·189 g/kg) for 12 weeks. Theeffects of the different fractions on bone properties in the OVX mice model were studied. In addition, their effects on osteoblast prolifer-ation and differentiation were evaluated in UMR 106 cells. SWC significantly restored bone mineral density and improved bone size andbone content parameters in the femur and tibia as well as increased biomechanical strength at the tibia diaphysis in OVX mice. Similarly,SWC was the most potent fraction in stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation in UMR 106 cells. Also, SWC did not alter uterusweight in OVX mice. Nine major peaks, seven lignans and two phenolic acids, in the HPLC fingerprint of the SWC fraction were identified,isolated and characterised. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that SWC was the most potent fraction in SWH that exerted anti-osteoporotic effects. Furthermore, lignans might be the potential bioactive components in SWC.Key words: Osteoporosis: Lignans: Sambucus williamsii HANCE: Phyto-oestrogensOsteoporosis is a skeletal disorder of reduced bone mass anddisruption of bone architecture with a consequent increase inbone fragility and fracture risk(1). The decline of gonadal func-tion following menopause and ageing plays a key role in thepathogenesis of osteoporosis. With a worldwide increase inageing populations, osteoporosis has become a more seriousglobal health problem. Hormone replacement therapy was aroutine method to alleviate physical symptoms and to preventthe clinical consequence of postmenopausal osteoporosis(2).However, recent studies suggest that hormone replacementtherapy is associated with an increased risk of developingbreast, ovarian and endometrial cancers(3–6). This has led toincreased interest in identifying natural oestrogen analoguesthat possess osteoprotective effects without any side effectson reproductive tissues. A class of plant-derived substances,the so-called ‘phyto-oestrogens’, has been reported to possessstructures similar to mammalian oestrogens and displayboth oestrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects(7–8). Isoflavones,lignans and cumestans are the major classes of phyto-oestrogen(7). Numerous studies on isoflavones in preventingthe loss of bone mineral density (BMD) have beenreported(9,10), while those that focus on the bone-protectiveeffects of lignans and cumestans are few.Sambucus williamsii HANCE (SWH), one species ofSambucus distributed in various regions of China, Korea andJapan, has been used as a folk medicine to treat bone and*Corresponding authors: Dr Man-Sau Wong, fax þ852 23649932, email bcmswong@polyu.edu.hk; Professor Xin-Sheng Yao, fax þ86 20 85225849,email yaoxinsheng@vip.tom.comAbbreviations: BMD, bone mineral density; BV/TV, bone volume/tissue volume; 3D, three-dimensional; E2, 17b-oestradiol; OVX, ovariectomised; Sham,sham-operated vehicle-treated; SWA, Sambucus williamsii HANCE water eluate; SWB, Sambucus williamsii HANCE 30% ethanol eluate; SWC,Sambucus williamsii HANCE 50 and 95 % ethanol eluates; SWH, Sambucus williamsii HANCE; Tb.N, trabecular bone number; Tb.Sp, trabecular boneseparation.British Journal of Nutrition (2011), 106, 1802–1809 doi:10.1017/S0007114511002546q The Authors 2011BritishJournalofNutritionjoint diseases in China for thousands of years(11). Our previousstudy showed that the ethanol extract of SWH had protectiveeffects on trabecular bone and cortical bone(12) and the mech-anisms included stimulation of osteoblast differentiation, inhi-bition of osteoclastogenesis as well as osteoclast actions(13).Moreover, lignans(14), phenolic acids(15), triterpenoids(16) andsome other compounds had been isolated from the ethanolextract of SWH. However, it is unclear which of the ingre-dients in SWH are responsible for its bone-protective actions.In the present study, both in vivo and in vitro models wereemployed to identify the active fractions and ingredients inSWH that account for its bone-protective actions. The bio-activities of fractions prepared from the ethanol extract ofSWH using a macroporous adsorption resin column weredetermined. The HPLC fingerprint of the bioactive fractionwas established and the major components were characterised.Materials and methodsPlant materials and isolationThe stems and branches of SWH were collected in Shenyang,Liaoning Province in the northeast of China in April 2007 andauthenticated according to a method listed in the ChineseBencao(17) with the help of Professor Zerong Jiang (ShenyangPharmaceutical University in Shenyang, China). The identity ofSWH was confirmed by analysing its major ingredients pen-tacylic triterpenoid, phenol acid and derivatives and protein.A voucher specimen (HHXSWGZ-2007) was deposited in theHerbarium of the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicineand Natural Products (Jinan University, Guangzhou, China).Dry stems and branches of SWH (50 kg) were refluxed with500 litres of 60 % (v/v) ethanol three times, for 2 h each time.After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reducedpressure and then freeze-dried to obtain a total extract of1·25 kg powder. As shown in Table 1, SWH (1250 g) wasapplied to a D-101 macroporous adsorptive resin column(diameter 8·0 cm £ height 96 cm), eluted with water and etha-nol in gradient, to give SWA (water eluate; 712·5 g), SWB (30 %ethanol eluate; 160·0 g) and SWC (50 and 95 % ethanol eluates;236·0 g). The 50 and 95 % ethanol eluates were combined togive SWC after HPLC analysis because both fractions containsimilar constituents and because the yield of the 95 % ethanoleluate was too low. The HPLC fingerprint of SWC wasestablished using the Agilent series 1200 HPLC system (AgilentTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA): a reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC column (Welch XB-C18, 4·60 £ 250 mm; Welch Mate-rial, Shanghai, China) with a gradient of methanol–water(0·1 % acetic acid) as the mobile phase (0–9 min, 25 %; 9–39 min, 36 %; 39–54 min, 50 %; 54–59 min, 100 %), at a flowrate of 0·8 ml/min. Detection wavelength was at 280 nm andcolumn temperature was at 358C. The major peaks of the fin-gerprint were characterised with the compounds isolated fromSWC using the same HPLC conditions.Animal studyA total of fifty-six virgin C57BL/6J specific-pathogen-free (SPF)female mice, aged 12 weeks, were purchased from LaboratoryAnimal Services Centre (Chinese University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong, China) and housed in cages under a 12 hlight–12 h dark cycle at 20 ^ 18C. During the study, all ani-mals were allowed free access to distilled deionised water,and OVX mice were pair-fed a phyto-oestrogen-free diet(D00031602; Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA)(Table 2) based on the average daily food consumption ofthe sham control group.The mice were either sham-operated (Sham, n 8) or ovari-ectomised (OVX, n 48). The treatment dose of each fractionwas deduced from the yield. The OVX mice were randomlydivided into six groups: vehicle-treated group (OVX, n 8);17b-oestradiol administration group (E2; n 8; 3·2mg/g bodyweight per d); SWH (ethanol extract group; n 8; 1·0 mg/gbody weight per d); SWA (water eluate group; n 8;0·570 mg/g body weight per d), SWB (30 % ethanol eluateTable 1.

A phyto-oestrogen-free diet was applied in the present study toeliminate interactions between diet and fractions of SWHthat had been reported in our previous study(13). Drug treat-ment started 2 weeks after the surgery and was administratedorally through a gastric tube for 3 months. At the end of thetreatment, the mice were killed, blood was withdrawn fromthe abdominal aorta and serum was prepared. From eachanimal, the uterus was collected, weighed and then stored at2808C. The left femur and tibia were dissected and cleanedof all soft tissue, then wrapped in gauze saturated with PBSbuffer, sealed in Eppendorf tubes and stored at 2208C forfurther analysis. The animal study protocols were approvedby the Animal Ethics Committee of The Hong Kong Poly-technic University.Micro-computed tomography analysis of bone propertiesThe distal metaphysis of femur and the proximal metaphysisof tibia were scanned with a high-resolution micro vivaCT40 system (Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Thedistal and proximal site was defined as 2·0 mm away fromthe femur end and tibia head. After images were captured,twenty out of 100 slices were chosen and established as thevolume of interest. Trabecular bone was separated from corti-cal bone by free drawing regions using the software providedwith the scanner. Then three-dimensional (3D) modellingwas generated and morphological date of the sample wasevaluated using a script-based 3D volume analysis tool IPL(Image Processing Language; Scanco Medical; http://www.scanco.ch/systems-solutions/software.html). 3D parametersfor trabecular bone were obtained as follows: (1) bonevolume/tissue volume (BV/TV); (2) trabecular bone number(Tb.N); (3) trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp); (4) BMD.Three-point bending testThe left tibias were cleaned to remove their surrounding softtissue before the test. A three-point bending machine(model H10KM; Hounsfield Test Equipment Limited, Redhill,Surrey, UK) was used to determine the mechanical strengthon the mid-shaft of the left tibia(18). The two supportingpoints were fixed 4 mm apart with a single central loadingpoint. A load was applied on the mid-shaft with a deformationrate of 2·0 mm/min and a load–deformation curve was plottedsimultaneously until the specimen was broken. Bendingstiffness was calculated as the slope of the linear part of theloading–deformation curve.Cell cultureUMR 106 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’smedium with 10 % fetal bovine serum, which was pre-supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin(100 mg/ml). At 80–90 % confluence, the cells were seeded ina ninety-six-well microtitre plate with 4000 cells/well. Afterincubation for 48 h, the culture medium was changed tophenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with1 % charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cellswere then treated with SWH fractions at 0·1, 1·0, 10 or100mg/ml for 24 or 48 h. The cells were cultured at 378C ina humidified atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO2.Cell proliferation assayThe proliferation effects of the fractions of SWH on the UMR106 cell line were determined by the MTS colorimetric assay.After treating with SWH fractions (0·1 to 100mg/ml) or vehiclefor 24 h or 48 h, the medium was removed, followed bythe addition of 0·2 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-car-boxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS;Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) and 1 mg/ml phenazinemethosulfate (PMS; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) reagent.The absorbance was detected on a microplate spectro-photometer (model 680; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at a wave-length of 490 nm after 2 h of incubation at 378C.Alkaline phosphatase activity assayAlkaline phosphatase activity of the treated cells was deter-mined by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (PromegaCorp.) to p-nitrophenol to assess the differentiation activityof UMR 106 cells. The treated cells were rinsed with PBStwice before 100ml p-nitrophenylphosphate were added tothem. Absorbance of the tested samples was measuredat 405 nm. All results are expressed as a ratio normalised tothe corresponding total protein content (optical density at405 nm/mg BSA).Statistical analysisThe data from these experiments are reported as mean valueswith their standard errors for each group. All statisticalanalyses were performed using PRISM version 5.0 (GraphPad,San Diego, CA, USA). Inter-group differences were analysedby one-way ANOVA, and followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test as a post hoc test to compare the groupmean if overall P,0·05. Differences of P,0·05 wereconsidered statistically significant.ResultsBody weight, uterine weight and serum biochemicalmakersThe effects of SWH fractions on body weight, uterus index andserum biochemical makers are summarised in Supplemen-tary Appendix 1 (available online at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bjn). As expected, body weight increasedsignificantly (P,0·05) and uterus index decreased significantly(P,0·05) in OVX mice as a result of oestrogen deficiency.Treatment of OVX mice with SWH or SWC extracts significantlyH.-H. Xiao et al.1804BritishJournalofNutritionsuppressed oestrogen deficiency-induced body-weight gain(v. OVX group, both P,0·001). Uterus indexes weresignificantly increased in OVX mice in response to treatmentwith E2 or SWH. However, uterus indexes of the mice treatedwith the fractions of SWH did not alter as compared with thosetreated with vehicle. Serum Ca level and P levels were notaltered by OVX or fractions of SWH.Micro-computed tomography analysis of left femur andtibiaAs shown in Table 3, ovariectomy significantly reduced BMDat the distal metaphysis of femur (P,0·05 v. sham) and theproximal metaphysis of tibia (P,0·05 v. sham) in mice. Treat-ment of OVX mice with E2 prevented the decrease in BMD atboth sites (P,0·001 v. OVX). Similarly, treatment of OVX micewith SWH or SWC significantly restored BMD at the femur andtibia. Trabecular bone microstructure, as indicated by para-meters such as BV/TV, Tb.N and Tb.Sp at the distal metaphysisof femur and at the proximal metaphysis of tibia deterioratedsignificantly in mice upon ovariectomy (Table 3; P,0·05 in allparameters at both sites). The damage of bone microstructureinduced by ovariectomy in mice at the femur were reversedsignificantly by treatment with SWH (P,0·01 in BV/TV),SWA (P,0·05 in BV/TV) or SWC (P,0·01 in BV/TV, P,0·01in Tb.N and P,0·05 in Tb.Sp) and at the tibia by treatmentwith SWH (P,0·001 in BV/TV, P,0·05 in Tb.N and P,0·01in Tb.Sp) or SWC (P,0·001 in BV/TV, P,0·05 in Tb.N andP,0·01 in Tb.Sp). Among all the fractions of SWH, thebone-protective effect of SWC was the same as or evenhigher than that of the total ethanol extract SWH. Therewere no differences of the trabecular bone parametersbetween Sham and the fraction-treated groups. The adminis-tration of SWH fractions restored the bone loss induced byovariectomy to the normal level and maintained the micro-architecture of trabecular bone.Biomechanical measurement of left tibiaTable 4 shows the effects of SWH fractions on the biomecha-nical properties of the left tibia in OVX mice. Three-pointbending experiments indicated that treatment of OVX micewith E2 significantly increased the ultimate load (P,0·001),breaking force (P,0·05) as well as stiffness (P,0·05) of thetibia mid-shaft. Ultimate load of the left tibia mid-shaft weresignificantly increased in OVX mice in response to treatmentwith different SWH fractions, namely SWA (P,0·05), SWB(P,0·05) and SWC (P,0·01). Breaking forces of the lefttibia mid-shaft were increased significantly in OVX mice inresponse to treatment with SWC (P,0·01) while treatmentwith SWH did not show such effects on the breaking force.Stiffness of the tibia was only increased in OVX mice inresponse to treatment with SWA (P,0·05). Treatment ofOVX mice with SWH fractions suppressed the OVX-inducedreduction of ultimate load and stiffness in the tibia, resultingin an increase back to the Sham level. However, E2 and allfractions of SWH had no significant effects on changes ofenergy of breaking.

The stimulatory effectsof SWA, SWB and SWC (Fig. 1(b), (c), (d)) on UMR 106 cellproliferation were more potent than the effects of SWH(Fig. 1(a)). Treatment of UMR 106 cells with 0·1 to 100mg/mlof SWA (Fig. 1(b)) or SWC (Fig. 1(d)) for 24 or 48 h significantlyincreased cell proliferation at all concentrations. SWB at 10 or100mg/ml (Fig. 1(c)) significantly increased UMR 106 cell pro-liferation. To determine the effects of different SWH extractson osteoblastic cell differentiation, alkaline phosphatase activi-ties in UMR 106 cells in response to different concentrations ofSWH, SWA, SWB and SWC were measured. As observed withE2, SWH (Fig. 2(a)) and SWB (Fig. 2(c)) significantly promotedcell differentiation activity at 0·1mg/ml (both P,0·05), whileSWA (Fig. 2(b)) had no effects on cell differentiation. SWC(Fig. 2(d)) significantly increased cell alkaline phosphataseactivity at all concentrations (0·1 to 100mg/ml), especially at1mg/ml (122·8 %), which was higher than the increased levelupon treatment with E2 (112·4 %).Identification of components in Sambucus williamsiiHANCE 50 and 95% ethanol eluateThe peaks of the HPLC fingerprint of SWC (SupplementaryAppendix 2; available online at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bjn) characterised with the compounds iso-lated from SWC were as follows: peak 1 (16·8 min, vanillicacid); peak 2 (22·7 min, coniferyl alcohol); peak 3 (28·3 min,(þ)-erythro-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-[4-(3-hydroxy-propanyl)-2-methoxy-phenoxy]-1, 3-propanediol); peak 4(29·3 min, (þ)-thero-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-[4-(3-hydroxypropanyl)-2-hydro-phenoxy]-1,3-propanediol);peak5(29·9 min, (þ)-thero-guaiacylglycerol-b-O-40-conifery ether);peak 6 (31·0 min, (þ)-erythro-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-[-4-(3-hydroxypropanyl)-2-methoxy-phenoxy]-1,3-propanediol); peak 7 (40·4 min, (þ )-lariciresinol); peak 8(42·1 min, dehydrodiconiferylalcohol); peak 9 (42·8 min,dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol). The sum of peak areasof peaks 1 to 9 occupied 87·0 % of the total peak areas.DiscussionThe present study systematically evaluated the osteoprotectiveeffects of different fractions of SWH in OVX mice and in ratosteoblast-like UMR 106 cells. The present results clearlydemonstrated that the 50 and 95 % ethanol eluates (SWC) ofthe ethanol extract of SWH suppressed OVX-induced loss inbone mass and bone strength and increase in body weight.Besides, SWC did not alter the uterus weight in OVX mice.Moreover, the present study showed that SWC effectivelypromoted proliferation and differentiation in UMR 106 cells.In addition, the present study identified that the majorcomponents isolated from SWC were lignans, which mayaccount for the osteoprotective effects of this fraction oreven this herb.Our recent study(13) reported that a 60 % ethanol extract ofSWH dose-dependently increased BMD but only a high-dosetreatment group showed statistically significant differencescompared with OVX mice. To investigate if further fractionsof SWH may lead to more potent protective effects inbone, SWH was separated with a macroporous adsorptiveresin column and three fractions were obtained. The bone-protective effects of the fractions and SWH were evaluatedand were compared using in vivo and in vitro results.Trabecular bone mass, trabecular bone microstructure andcortical bone biomechanical strength are three key aspectsassociated with bone properties and turnover(19). Micro-com-puted tomography measurement showed that SWH improvedtrabecular BMD and suppressed disruption of trabecularbone microstructure of the femur and tibia in OVX mice,Table 4.

Xiao et al.1806BritishJournalofNutritiona result that is in accordance with our previous study(12,13).The fractions obtained from further fractionations of SWH(i.e. SWA and SWC) did inhibit bone mineral loss inducedby ovariectomy. In particular, the protective effects of SWCon trabecular bone in OVX mice were comparable with theeffects of SWH. Moreover, micro-architectural parameterssuch as BV/TV, Tb.N and Tb.Sp of trabecular bone at thedistal metaphysis of femur and the proximal metaphysis oftibia in OVX mice were significantly improved by treatmentwith SWC and the improvement was even higher than broughtabout by SWH. The results of three-point bending experi-ments on tibial cortical bone demonstrated that all fractionsof SWH could significantly increase the ultimate load of thetibia diaphysis. Furthermore, the SWC treatment significantlyincreased breaking force and SWA treatment significantlyincreased stiffness in OVX mice. These results indicated thatall fractions of SWH significantly improved the biomecha-nical strength of the long bone in OVX mice. The analysis ofmicro-computed tomography and three-point bending testssuggested that SWC may contain nearly all (87 %) of theactive ingredients of SWH that account for its protective effectson bone mass and bone quality.SWH extract inhibited bone resorption by suppressingosteoclastogenesis via modulation of the osteoprotegerin:receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (OPG:RANKL) ratio inUMR 106 cells(12). To investigate the effects of different SWHfractions on osteoblastic cell function, the proliferation anddifferentiation of osteoblast-like UMR 106 cells were deter-mined in the present study. The studies showed that SWHpromoted cell proliferation and differentiation at 1 and0·1mg/ml, respectively. Fractions obtained from further frac-tionation of SWH stimulated osteoblastic cell proliferationand differentiation. Among the fractions, SWC showed veryhigh potency for increasing cell proliferation and differen-tiation at doses from 0·1 to 100mg/ml. Our in vitro resultsconfirmed the conclusion of the in vivo experiment thatSWC was the fraction with the highest potency on bone pro-tection and was enriched with most of the active ingredientsin SWH that account for its ability to improve bone properties.Our previous study found that the most effective dose(1000 mg/kg) of ethanol extract of SWH after conversionfrom animal to human dosage was 5·5 g/d in women with abody weight of 50 kg(13). Similarly, the treatment dose ofSWC (0·189 g/kg) applied in the present study for theimprovement of bone properties will be 1·0 g/d for postmeno-pausal women administered orally. The present findingrevealed that a lower dose of SWC will be needed to obtaineffects that are similar to or even better than SWH.Oestrogen or substances with oestrogenic potential werepreviously shown to be able to attenuate ovariectomy-inducedweight gain(19–21). The present results showed that SWH andSWC significantly suppressed the body-weight gain inducedby OVX, suggesting that SWH and SWC might also containphyto-oestrogens. Similar to our previous study(13), the pre-sent study confirmed that SWH stimulated the increase ofuterus weight in OVX animals. In contrast to SWH, SWC didnot alter uterus weight in OVX mice, suggesting that SWCdid not exert undesirable oestrogen-like effects on the2·0*** *** *** *** ***††† †††††† ††††††(b)1·5Ratio v. control (OD 490 nm)1·00·50·0ControlE 2 (10–8 M)0·1 1 10 1002·0*** ***†† †††SWH (µg/ml)(a)1·5Ratio v. control (OD 490 nm)1·00·50·0ControlE 2 (10–8 M)0·1 1 10 1002·0******** ***†††††† †††††††††(d)1·5Ratio v. control (OD 490 nm)1·00·50·0ControlE 2 (10–8 M)0·1 1 10 1002·0** ** ***†††††††††(c)1·5Ratio v. control (OD 490  nm)1·00·50·0ControlE 2 (10–8 M)0·1 1 10 100SWA (µg/ml)SWB (µg/ml)SWC (µg/ml)Fig. 1.

Rachon´ et al.(19–21) found that daidzeinand purarin at high doses (1·0 and 3·0 g/kg, respectively)exerted uterotropic effects on OVX rats. Our studies providean exciting result for finding a new agent for bone protectionwithout unsatisfactory effects on the uterus.Phenolic acids(15), lignans(14,22), triterpenoids(16) and someother compounds had been isolated from SWH in our previousstudy. However, the major active ingredients that account forits bone protection in vivo are still not known. In the presentstudy, seven lignans and two phenolic acids, which are themajor components in SWC, were identified. The resultsindicated that lignans might be the active ingredients in theSWH fraction that account for its bone-protective effectsin vivo. However, the biological activities of these isolatedcompounds were been studied in the present investigation.Further study will be needed to confirm if these compoundscan directly stimulate the growth and differentiation of bonecells as well as exert osteoprotective effects in vivo.In conclusion, the present study revealed that SWC was thefraction of highest potency in SWH and that it could preventbone loss, improve trabecular bone microstructure andincrease cortical bone strength in OVX mice. Most importantly,the doses of SWC used in the present study can fully restorebone loss to the pre-OVX level. The in vitro experimentssuggested that SWC might increase bone formation by pro-moting proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-likecells. Most importantly, the effective dose of SWC to achievesimilar bone-protective effects as SWH is found to be onlyone fifth of that of SWH. In addition, seven lignans andtwo phenolic acids, which are the major peaks of the HPLCfingerprint of SWC, were identified. Further studies areneeded to characterise the mechanism by which the isolatedlignans and phenolic acids exert anabolic effects on bonecells, presumably osteoblasts. The present study suggeststhat SWC needs to be investigated as a natural alternative forthe management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.AcknowledgementsThe present study was supported by the Niche areaResearch Grant from the Research Committee of The HongKong Polytechnic University (I-BB8N, GU324, GU256) andthe Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovation Circle Funding Scheme(2006).
