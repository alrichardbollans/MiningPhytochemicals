In genomes uncoupled (gun)mutants, LHCB1.2 expression is maintained in the presence of LIN or other inhibitors of early chloroplastdevelopment. In a screen using concentrations of LIN lower than those employed to isolate gun mutants,we have identified happy on lincomycin (holi) mutants. Several holi mutants show an increased toleranceto LIN, exhibiting de-repressed LHCB1.2 expression and chlorophyll synthesis in seedlings. The mutationsresponsible were identified by whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping, and mostwere found to affect the phenylpropanoid pathway; however, LHCB1.2 expression does not appear to bedirectly regulated by phenylpropanoids, as indicated by the metabolic profiling of mutants. The most potentholi mutant is defective in a subunit of cellulose synthase encoded by IRREGULAR XYLEM 3, and compara-tive analysis of this and other cell-wall mutants establishes a link between secondary cell-wall integrity andearly chloroplast development, possibly involving altered ABA metabolism or sensing.Keywords: chloroplast, lincomycin, retrograde signaling, cell wall, phenylpropanoids.INTRODUCTIONThe vast majority of the several thousand proteins foundin plastids are encoded by nuclear genes (Timmis et al.,2004). As endosymbiotic descendants of cyanobacteria,however, plastids still contain 80–230 genes, most of whichare involved in essential plastid functions like energy pro-duction and plastid gene expression (PGE) (Ponce-Toledoet al., 2017). As a result, plastid multiprotein complexes (in-cluding the photosystems and ribosomes) consist of sub-units encoded by both the nuclear and plastid genomes.This in turn accounts for the need for coordination of PGEand nuclear gene expression (NGE). Thus, the nucleusinfluences activity in the plastids, including PGE, via ‘an-terograde control/signaling’ (Stern et al., 2010), whereasplastids communicate their developmental and metabolicstatus to the nucleus via ‘retrograde signaling’, allowingthe nucleus to adjust NGE appropriately (Kleine et al.,2009; Chi et al., 2013; Terry and Smith, 2013; Chan et al.,2016; Kleine and Leister, 2016). Plastid-derived retrogradesignals can be divided into two classes: signals related tothe operation of the plastid under changing environmentalconditions (operational control) and signals triggered bychanges in plastid and photosystem biogenesis (biogeniccontrol) (Chan et al., 2016).Forward-genetic screens have permitted the identifica-tion of components involved in retrograde signaling path-ways (Kleine and Leister, 2016). They have exploited thefact that the expression of nuclear genes for plastid pro-teins like LHCB1.2 (a major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein) is reduced in seedlings exposed to inhi-bitors of PGE (e.g. lincomycin, LIN) or carotenoid biosyn-thesis (e.g. norflurazon, NF) (Oelmuller and Mohr, 1986;Oelmuller et al., 1986). The first mutant screen specificallydesigned to characterize components of biogenic plastidsignaling was performed with Arabidopsis thaliana seed-lings grown on NF (Susek et al., 1993), and identifiedmutant seedlings that continued to accumulate LHCB1.2transcripts. Five different genomes uncoupled (gun)© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons LtdThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License,which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited andis not used for commercial purposes.156The Plant Journal (2020) 101, 156–170 doi: 10.1111/tpj.14527mutants were initially isolated (Susek et al., 1993; Mochi-zuki et al., 2001). GUN1 codes for a nucleic-acid-bindingchloroplast protein (Koussevitzky et al., 2007), whereasGUN2–GUN5 encode enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosyn-thesis pathway (Mochizuki et al., 2001; Larkin et al., 2003).Subsequent investigations of the gun mutants led to con-tradictory conclusions as to a putative plastid signalingfunction of the tetrapyrrole pathway intermediate Mg-pro-toporphyrin IX (Strand et al., 2003; Mochizuki et al., 2008;Moulin et al., 2008). To resolve these discrepancies, a gain-of-function screen based on activation tagging was con-ducted in the reporter line that was used in the originalgun mutant screen (Woodson et al., 2011). This screenidentified the gun6-1D mutant, which overexpresses fer-rochelatase 1 (FC1), and prompted the proposal that thetetrapyrrole heme – specifically the fraction produced byFC1 – might function as a biogenic retrograde signal(Woodson et al., 2011; Terry and Smith, 2013). With theintention of identifying additional mutants with more sub-tle gun phenotypes than those detected in the originalscreen (Susek et al., 1993), a transgenic line in which theLHCB1.1 promoter was fused to the more sensitive repor-ter luciferase was used in a further screen (Ruckle et al.,2007), and mutants that exhibited a gun phenotype on NFwere also tested on LIN-containing medium. As a result,four cryptochrome 1 (cry1) alleles and long hypocotyl 5(hy5) were identified (Ruckle et al., 2007). More recently,overexpressors of GLK1 or GLK2 have been shown tobehave like strong gun mutants when challenged with NFor LIN (Leister and Kleine, 2016; Martin et al., 2016).Inhibitors like NF and LIN have numerous secondaryeffects, however: for example, the massive accumulationof anthocyanins (Cottage et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2010). Amodified version of the gun mutant screen was thereforedesigned, which used less NF and a lower light intensity,and resulted in fewer side effects, primarily by avoidinganthocyanin accumulation (Saini et al., 2011). Unlike theoriginal gun mutants and wild-type (WT) plants, the happyon norflurazon (hon) mutants recovered in this screenremained green in the presence of (lower doses of) NF.The hon mutations were mapped to ClpR4, a nucleus-en-coded subunit of the plastid-localized Clp protease com-plex, and to a putative chloroplast translation elongationfactor, and thus are likely to interfere with PGE and plastidprotein homeostasis (Saini et al., 2011).Lincomycin and NF have similar effects on gun1, hy5and cry1 (Ruckle et al., 2007) mutants, as well as on theGLK overexpressors (Leister and Kleine, 2016; Martin et al.,2016), but gun2, gun4 and gun5 mutants differ in theirresponses to these agents (Gray et al., 2003). This distinc-tion suggests that NF and LIN trigger at least partially dif-ferent signaling pathways.In an effort to isolate additional gun mutants specifi-cally for the LIN pathway(s), we screened an ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized A. thaliana Col-0population grown in the presence of a greater than four-fold lower dose of LIN than that used in the earlier screens.In this way, happy on lincomycin (holi) mutants that areable to green in the presence of LIN were identified. In asecond screen with a fivefold lower NF concentration rela-tive to that used in the original screens, we identified addi-tional hon mutants. Characterization of these mutantssuggested that: (i) there is no correlation between gun sig-naling and anthocyanin biosynthesis; and (ii) early chloro-plast development is linked to cell-wall integrity.RESULTSIsolation of happy on lincomycin (holi) mutantsSeedlings grown on LIN experience severe photo-oxidativedamage, plastid biogenesis is arrested at a proplastid-likestage, even under normal light conditions (Oelmuller andMohr, 1986), and the expression of nuclear genes encodingchloroplast proteins is altered (Oelmuller et al., 1986). Inscreens intended to isolate mutants displaying the gunphenotype on LIN, a concentration of 220 lg ml1 LIN(high LIN) and light intensities of 100–125 lmol pho-tons m2 sec1 were used (Koussevitzky et al., 2007;Ruckle et al., 2007). Under such conditions, 5-day-oldA. thaliana Col-0 seedlings were retarded in growth, failedto green and accumulated appreciable concentrations ofanthocyanins (Figure 1a). Using the same light intensity asin previous screens, we gradually reduced the LIN concen-tration until the coloration of the seedling populationturned from purple (as a result of anthocyanin production)to greenish or white. Although some seedlings turned lightgreen with a concentration of 25 lg ml1 LIN, growth on50 lg ml1 LIN (low LIN) produced uniformly purple-col-ored seedlings (Figure 1a). The latter concentration wasstill sufficient to reduce the accumulation of the nucleus-encoded transcripts encoding the chloroplast proteinsLhcb1.2 and CA1 to 8.0% (high LIN, 1.5%) and 6% (highLIN, 1.0%), respectively, of the levels seen in MS-grownseedlings (Figure 1b). Thus, this low LIN dose still activatesretrograde signaling. The gun1-1 mutant used as a controlaccumulated fewer anthocyanins than the WT when grownon high LIN, confirming a previous finding (Cottage et al.,2010). Approximately half of the gun1-1 seedlings grownon low LIN displayed whitish cotyledons, which were lar-ger than those of the WT (Figure 1a).Based on these observations, a screen was set up toidentify mutants with an altered, visually discernible phe-notype on low LIN. To this end, Col-0 seeds were mutage-nized with EMS. The M1 plants were grown to maturity toproduce M2 seeds, and ~20 000 4- to 5-day-old M2 seed-lings were grown on low LIN and screened for alterationsin the color or size of cotyledons. This led to the isolationof six holi mutants (Figure 2). The mutants holi1 and holi3© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Plant Journal, (2020), 101, 156–170Secondary cell wall and chloroplast development 157had yellowish cotyledons and did not accumulate antho-cyanins. Cotyledons of the other mutants turned lightgreen and accumulated anthocyanins to various levels.When grown on high levels of LIN, holi2 displayed smallercotyledons and hyperaccumulation of anthocyanins com-pared with all other mutants and the WT (Figure 2). A simi-lar screen in which low LIN was replaced by low NF (1 lm,instead of the 5 lm NF used in the original gun mutantscreen; Susek et al., 1993) aimed to identify new honmutants. This screen yielded hon mutants (hon24, hon33and hon41) with completely white cotyledons. On low LIN,the cotyledons of these hon mutants also appeared yel-low–greenish, like those of the holi mutants (Figure 2). Toconfirm that the greenish color was caused by chlorophyllaccumulation, autofluorescence was monitored after UVexcitation of seedlings grown on low LIN (Figure 2). Col-0,Figure 1.

(a) Pictures of wild-type (WT) and gun1-1 seedlingsgrown for 5 days on MS supplemented with the indicated concentrations of LIN. (b) Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was used to determine LHCB1.2 andCA1 mRNA levels in WT seedlings grown under continuous light (100 lmol photons m2 sec1) on MS plates without inhibitor or supplemented with either50 lg ml1 LIN or 220 lg ml1 LIN. The levels of LHCB1.2 and CA1 mRNA are expressed relative to those in the WT control (grown in the absence of inhibitor),which was set to 1. The results were normalized to the expression level of AT4G36800. Mean values were derived from two independent experiments, each withthree technical replicates.

Wild-type (WT), holi and hon mutantseedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light (100 lmol photons m2 sec1) on MS plates supplemented with either LIN (50 or 220 lg ml1) or NF (1or 5 lM). Autofluorescence after UV excitation was monitored in seedlings grown on MS plates supplemented with 50 lg ml1 LIN. The red autofluorescencewas used as an indicator for chlorophyll accumulation.© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Plant Journal, (2020), 101, 156–170158 Duorong Xu et al.holi3 and hon24 seedlings displayed no autofluorescence,as expected when chlorophyll is absent; however, fourmutants (holi2, hol1i4, holi5 and holi6) displayed markedlevels of autofluorescence, whereas three others (holi1,hon33 and hon41) displayed weaker autofluorescence.Notably, none of the hon or holi mutants appeared greeneron either high or low NF (Figure 2), in agreement with theabsence of chlorophyll autofluorescence observed underthese conditions.Several holi mutants display a gun phenotype on low LINThe chlorophyll-autofluorescence phenotype of some ofthe hon and holimutants prompted us to test whether theircontinued plastid development despite growth on LIN wasassociated with altered signaling to the nucleus. To thisend, RNA was prepared from 5-day-old Col-0, gun1-1, andthe various hon and holi mutant seedlings grown on lowLIN, and subjected to Northern analysis to determine thesteady-state levels of LHCB1.2 mRNA. Following exposureto the low LIN concentration, the gun1-1mutant showed, asexpected, higher LHCB1.2 mRNA expression than the WT(Figure 3). Remarkably, LHCB1.2 mRNA levels in the holi2,holi4, holi5 and holi6 mutants were comparable with, oreven higher than, that of the gun1-1 mutant. Under controlconditions (without inhibitor treatment), however, LHCB1.2mRNA levels were already slightly elevated in the holi2,holi3, holi5 and holi6 mutants, which means that the gunphenotype on low LIN was relativized by around 1.7-fold(Figure 3). Grown on low NF, some of the holi mutants alsodisplayed very weak gun phenotypes. But none of the iden-tified hon and holi mutants behaved like a gun mutantwhen grown on high NF or high LIN (Figure 3).The majority of HOLI and HON loci encode proteinsinvolved in the flavonoid pathwayIn order to explain the ability of some of the identifiedmutants to accumulate chlorophyll and maintain LHCB1.2transcript accumulation in the presence of low LIN, the M4generation of the mutant plants was back-crossed to theirparent Col-0, and seedlings displaying recessive and semi-dominant (in the case of holi2) mutant phenotypes wereidentified in the F2 generation. The underlying mutationswere localized by next-generation sequencing (see Experi-mental procedures) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.The holi1 and hon41 mutations turned out to be allelic,and both were mapped to the gene for the transcriptionfactor MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 75 (MYB75; PRODUCTIONOF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1, PAP1). The CT substitu-tion at nucleotide (nt) 902 (relative to the start codon, asalso in the following) in holi1 results in the replacement ofan Arg by an Lys residue and permits some anthocyaninaccumulation, whereas in hon41 a CT substitution atnt 39 introduces a stop codon in the first exon (Figure 4),completely blocking anthocyanin accumulation (Figure 2).Moreover, in holi3 a Trp codon is replaced by a stop in thegene for the transcription factor TRANSPARENT TESTAGLABRA 1 (TTG1, required for purple anthocyanin accu-mulation). The GA substitution at nt 10 in hon24 and theCT substitution at nt 987 in hon33 caused non-sensemutations in DIHYDROFLAVONOL 4-REDUCTASE (DFR;TRANSPARENT TESTA 3, TT3) and ANTHOCYANIDINFigure 3.

Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continu-ous light (100 lmol photons m2 sec1) on MS plates without inhibitor orsupplemented with either LIN (50 or 220 lg ml1) or NF (1 or 5 lM). LHCB1.2mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analyses. The methyleneblue-stained blots served as loading controls (M.B.).© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Plant Journal, (2020), 101, 156–170Secondary cell wall and chloroplast development 159SYNTHASE (ANS; LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN DIOXYGEN-ASE, LDOX; TANNIN DEFIFIENT SEED 4, TDS4; TT18),respectively. The mutation that most probably causes theholi2 mutant phenotype is located at nt 4125, and replacesa Val by an Ile residue in REDUCED EPIDERMALFLUORESCENCE 4 (REF4; MEDIATOR COMPLEX MED 5B,MED5B; MED33B). The GA substitution in holi6 intro-duces a premature stop in exon 7 of IRREGULAR XYEM 3(IRX3; CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 7, CESA7; MURUS 10,MUR10). The mutations responsible for the holi4 and holi5phenotypes could not be identified. With the exception ofIRX3, all affected proteins have previously been shown tobe involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism (Figure S1;Stout et al., 2008; Appelhagen et al., 2014). MYB75 andTTG1 are transcription factors, and DFR and ANS areenzymes that convert dihydroquercetin to leucocyanidin(DFR) and leucocyanidin to cyanidin, respectively (Fig-ure S1). REF4 is required for phenylpropanoid homeostasisand has been shown to interact directly with the conservedtranscriptional coregulatory complex Mediator (Bonawitzet al., 2012).Disturbances in the phenylpropanoid pathway do notconfer a gun phenotypeAnthocyanins are produced via the flavonoid pathway,which is a branch of the general phenylpropanoid biosyn-thetic pathway (Tohge et al., 2005; Appelhagen et al.,2014). The gun1-1 mutant clearly accumulates less antho-cyanin than the WT when grown on both low and high LINconcentrations (Figure 1a), and it was noted previously thatgun2, gun4 and gun5 mutants accumulate less antho-cyanin than WT plants when grown on high NF (Voigtet al., 2010). Therefore, the growth of 5-day-old gun1, gun4and gun5 mutant seedlings was also tested under ourreduced inhibitor conditions (Figure S2). In the WT, gun1-1and gun1-102 seedlings, anthocyanin accumulation wasclearly discernible in seedlings grown on low and high NFin continuous white light; however, on high NF, theFigure 4.

Numbers are given relative to the start codon ATG.© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Plant Journal, (2020), 101, 156–170160 Duorong Xu et al.stronger gun1 allele (gun1-102) displayed slightly lessanthocyanin accumulation than the weaker allele (gun1-1)(Figure S2). In contrast, gun4-1 and gun5-1 accumulatedless anthocyanin on both NF concentrations, whereas theyaccumulated WT levels of anthocyanins on high LIN. It haspreviously been speculated that plastid signals that requireGUN2–GUN5 might stimulate anthocyanin biosynthesis,although anthocyanin content and LHCB1.2 mRNA accu-mulation in gun mutants are not strictly correlated (Voigtet al., 2010). As these authors considered only the accumu-lation of visible anthocyanins, reverse-phase ultra-perfor-mance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was used to profilethe accumulation of phenylpropanoids in 5-day-old Col-0,gun1-1, gun2-1, gun4-1 and gun5-1 seedlings grown onMS in the absence or presence of high NF or high LIN. Inthe WT, high NF and high LIN caused approximately 2.0-and 1.5-fold increases in the total phenylpropanoid con-tent, respectively (Figure S3; Table S1). Total phenyl-propanoids were similarly boosted in the gun2-1, gun4-1and gun5-1 mutants, but in gun1-1 they were approxi-mately 1.5-fold induced after NF treatment and notinduced at all by treatment with high LIN. A closer lookat the accumulation of specific phenylpropanoid compo-nents revealed that the difference between gun1-1 andthe WT is mainly attributable to a lack of induction ofkaempferol derivatives in gun1-1 (Figure S3; Table S1). Inparticular, kaempferol 3-O-[6″-O-(rhamnosyl) glucoside] 7-O-rhamnoside (k3; see also Figure S1) was less effec-tively induced in all investigated gun mutants after NFtreatment, as well as in gun1-1 after LIN treatment; noneof the other detected compounds showed any consistentalteration in the gun mutants relative to the WT (Fig-ure S3; Table S1). Levels of k3 are also reduced in theUDP-glucosyl transferase ugt78d1 ugt78d2 mutant (Yinet al., 2014). To definitively clarify whether disturbancesin the phenylpropanoid pathway are linked to chloroplastdevelopment and/or a gun phenotype in the presence ofinhibitors, 5-day-old ugt78d1 ugt78d2 mutants, togetherwith mutants impaired in enzymatic steps of the generalphenylpropanoid pathway (Figure S1), or regulatory fac-tors of flavonoid biosynthesis and transporters involvedin proanthocyanidin accumulation (Appelhagen et al.,2014), were first tested for chlorophyll autofluorescenceon low LIN (Figure 5). Because cry1 mutants were previ-ously identified as weak gun mutants on high LIN(Ruckle et al., 2007), the mutants cry1-304 and cry1-304 cry2-1, and the constitutive photomorphogenesismutant cop1-4, were included as controls together withgun1-1. Chlorophyll autofluorescence could be detectedin gun1-1, cry1-304, cry1-304 cry2-1, as well as in thecop1-4 mutant (Figure 5). All transport-related and regu-lation mutants showed some chlorophyll fluorescence,although this was restricted to the hypocotyl in ttg1-22,ttg2-5 and tt8-6 mutants. The biosynthesis mutantstt4-15, tt5-2, tt7-7, tt3-1 and tds4-2 showed the greenishfluorescence typical of kaempferol derivatives (Appelha-gen et al., 2014) and only very weak or no chlorophyllautofluorescence (Figure 5). These mutants are defectivein steps in the main pathway leading from chalconesynthase (tt4-15) to the conversion of leucocyanidin tocyanidin (tds4-2), which is the branch point for the pro-duction of anthocyanins and oxidized tannins (Figure S1).Thus, these mutants do not accumulate anthocyanins.The ban-5, tt15-4, tt6-2 and fls1-3 mutants displayed simi-lar levels of chlorophyll fluorescence to the gun1-1 andcry1-304 mutants and the transport-related aha10-6mutant. The tt10-8 mutant showed the strongest chloro-phyll autofluorescence, which was reflected in a lightgreenish cotyledon phenotype, with some cotyledonseven exhibiting a brighter green color (Figure 5).When grown in the presence of low LIN or high NF,gun1-1, cry1-304 and cry1-304 cry2-1 seedlings accumu-lated LHCB1.2 in the presence of the inhibitors but, inaccordance with Ruckle et al. (2007), the cop1-4 mutant didnot (Figure 6a). It is noteworthy here that cry1 andcry1 cry2 seedlings grown on low LIN accumulated evenhigher levels of LHCB1.2 mRNA than gun1-1. Theugt78d1 ugt78d2 mutant (in which k3 is diminished) andthe other phenylpropanoid mutants did not accumulateLHCB1.2 mRNA, with the sole exception of the tt10-8mutant, which continued to express LHCB1.2 in the pres-ence of low LIN but not in the presence of high NF (Fig-ure 6b). TT10/LAC15 is similar to laccase-like polyphenoloxidases and is involved in lignin biosynthesis (Lianget al., 2006).Taken together, these data imply that there is no directlink between phenylpropanoid accumulation and gun sig-naling.A defect in the secondary cell wall promotes seedlinggreeningThe holi6 mutant was among the identified mutants thatdisplayed the strongest chlorophyll autofluorescence whengrown on MS plates supplemented with low LIN (Figure 2).To confirm that the premature stop in IRX3 (CESA7) foundin holi6 was responsible for this phenotype, two additionalirx3 mutant alleles, irx3-2 (confirmation of the T-DNA inser-tion and a lack of the full-length transcript is shown in Fig-ure S4) and irx3-4 (Brown et al., 2005), were grown on lowLIN. Indeed, the cotyledons of irx3-2 and irx3-4 were visiblygreener and displayed higher autofluorescence than thecotyledons of the WT (Figure 7a), which is reflective of ahigher chlorophyll content (Figure 7b). Moreover, althoughattempts to determine the maximum quantum yield ofphotosystem II (Fv/Fm) with an Imaging PAM fluorometerwere unsuccessful in WT grown on low LIN, this parametercould be measured in holi6, and irx3-2 and irx3-4 displayedeven higher Fv/Fm values (Figure 7a).© 2019 The Authors.The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Plant Journal, (2020), 101, 156–170Secondary cell wall and chloroplast development 161IRX3/CESA7 is a member of the cellulose synthase (CESA)family. The CESA complexes required for the synthesis ofprimary and secondary cell walls differ in composition:IRX3, together with IRX1/CESA8 and IRX5/CESA4, is neededspecifically for the synthesis of cellulose in the secondarycell wall, which also contains lignin (Meents et al., 2018;Polko and Kieber, 2019). CESA1/RADIALLY SWOLLEN 1(RSW1), CESA3 and CESA6-like proteins (CESA2, CESA5,CESA6 and CESA9) are involved in primary cell-wall synthe-sis (Meents et al., 2018; Polko and Kieber, 2019).These findings raise the question of whether the holi phe-notype might be caused by: (i) a general reduction in cellu-lose content in the secondary cell wall; (ii) reduced cellulosecontent in the primary cell wall; or (iii) a lack of hemicellu-loses in the secondary cell wall. To clarify this issue, mutantswith reduced cellulose content in the secondary cell wall(irx1-2, irx1-3 and irx5-4), together with a mutant withreduced cellulose content in the primary cell wall (rsw1-1;Williamson et al., 2001) and a mutant with reduced contentof the hemicellulose xylan in the secondary cell wall (irx9-2;Bauer et al., 2006), were germinated on low LIN medium.The irx1 seedlings displayed comparably high autofluores-cence to holi6 seedlings, whereas irx5-4 displayed weakerautofluorescence, and rsw1-1 and irx9-2 behaved like the WT(Figure 7c). Moreover, Fv/Fm could not be detected in theadditionally investigated mutants. Reduced cellulose produc-tion can affect growth and morphogenesis in various plantparts, as exemplified by the swollen roots of rsw1 mutantsgrown at 31°C (Arioli et al., 1998; Williamson et al., 2001). Totest for any temperature dependency of the Fv/Fm phenotype,rsw1-1 together with the other cell wall mutants was germi-nated at 31°C on control MS plates and on MS plates supple-mented with low LIN. Cotyledons of the rsw1-1mutant weresmaller under both conditions, confirming the heat growthphenotype observed previously (Williamson et al., 2001),but, as in all other tested mutants, Fv/Fm was WT-like (Fig-ure S5a). Interestingly, both the greening and the elevatedFv/Fm phenotypes were barely detectable under low LINFigure 5.

Moreover,the potential greening capacity of rsw1-1 seedlings on LINmight be masked by the temperature sensitivity of thismutant.Figure 6.

WT and the mutants described in the legend to Figure 6 were grown for 5 days under continuous light (100 lmol pho-tons m2 sec1) on MS plates supplemented with (a) 50 lg ml1 lincomycin (LIN) or (b) 5 lM norflurazon (NF). LHCB1.2 mRNA levels were determined by North-ern blot analyses.

Moreover, LHCB1.2 mRNA expression is higherwhen the holi6 mutant is grown on low LIN, as well as incontrol conditions (Figure 3). To investigate the behaviorof ABA-responsive genes and nuclear genes for chloroplastproteins on a transcriptome-wide level in irx3 mutants,RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA isolated from 5-day-old WT and irx3-2 seedlings grown in the absence ofLIN (control) or on low LIN. Low LIN elicited substantial(more than twofold) changes in gene expression in the WT(915 up; 2313 down) and irx3-2 (1139 up; 1978 down) seed-lings (Figure 8a,b; Table S2). Of the genes up- and down-regulated in WT seedlings upon LIN treatment, 39 and36%, respectively, were dependent on the presence offunctional IRX3, namely those that were not more thantwofold differentially expressed in irx3-2. Gene ontology(GO) analysis (Huang et al., 2009) of these IRX3-dependentgenes identified an enrichment for the cellular componentcategory ‘mitochondria’ among the 39% upregulated genes(Figure 8c), and in the categories ‘chloroplast stroma’, ‘thy-lakoid’, ‘chloroplast envelope’, ‘integral component ofplasma membrane’ and ‘chloroplast’ among the 36%downregulated genes (Figure 8d). This showed that, inaddition to LHCB1.2, other photosynthesis-related geneswere de-repressed in irx3 seedlings.When grown under control conditions (without LIN), thetranscriptome of the irx3-2 mutant showed only moderatechanges relative to the WT: the mRNA levels of 20 (41) or46 (70) genes were significantly reduced or elevated (bymore than 2.0- and 1.5-fold, respectively) (Figure 8a,b;Table S2). Analyses of the 1.5-fold changes revealed that inthe downregulated gene set, only ‘chloroplast’ was signifi-cantly enriched in the cellular component category (CC),whereas the biological process (BP) categories ‘glucosino-late biosynthesis’, ‘leucine biosynthesis’ and ‘response toinsect’ were more than 60-fold enriched (Figure 8e). In theupregulated gene set, the CC category ‘protein storage vac-uole’ and several chloroplast-associated categories likeFigure 7.

Among the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsivegenes were the genes for the chloroplast-localized proteinsCOLD-REGULATED 15a (COR15a) and COR15b. Of note isalso the slight (approximately 1.4-fold) but significantinduction of genes encoding several Lhcb proteins andsubunits of photosystems I and II (Figure 3; Tables S2 andS3), which was reflected in an approximately 1.5-foldhigher chlorophyll content in 5-day-old holi6 and irx3mutant seedlings (Figure 8f).Taken together, these results suggest a role for the sec-ondary cell wall in seedling greening, even under normalgrowth conditions. Moreover, a defect in IRX3 results in aweak gun phenotype on low LIN and leads to altered ABAmetabolism or sensitivity.DISCUSSIONNorflurazon is an inhibitor of phytoene desaturase andblocks carotenoid biosynthesis, whereas LIN binds to the50S subunit of the plastid ribosome, thus inhibiting proteinsynthesis in the organelle.

Weattempted to isolate further mutants that can better copewith LIN. High concentrations of LIN (220 lg ml1) wereused in previous studies (Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Ruckleet al., 2007; Choy et al., 2008; Cottage et al., 2010; Sunet al., 2016), and we found that a greater than fourfoldlower concentration (50 lg ml1) of LIN still repressednucleus-encoded photosynthesis genes (Figure 1b). More-over, the use of low LIN uncovered a clear phenotypicaldifference between gun1-1 and WT seedlings, as cotyle-dons were larger and anthocyanin accumulation was lesspronounced in the gun1-1 mutant (Figure 1a). With theexception of the hon mutant screen, in which lower NFand light dosages were used (Saini et al., 2011), all previ-ous gun mutant screens used reporter genes to identifymutants with de-repressed LHCB expression (Kleine andLeister, 2016). In contrast, we attempted to isolate mutantsbased on visually discernible differences from the WTwhen grown on low LIN. Although the earlier hon mutantscreen identified mutants that are affected in chloroplastprotein homeostasis, our low-LIN screen led to the identifi-cation of ‘holi’ and additional ‘hon’ mutants for proteinsinvolved in: (i) the flavonoid pathway; and (ii) secondarycell wall formation (Figure 4).We used 5-day-old seedlings grown on MS supple-mented with sucrose to investigate phenylpropanoid accu-mulation and parameters associated with chloroplastdevelopment, i.e. the maximum quantum yield of photo-system II, LHCB1.2 expression levels and greening. In1992, it was found that several transcripts for enzymes ofthe flavonoid biosynthetic pathway reached a maximum in3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in continuous light.The authors concluded that the peak anthocyanin contentappeared to coincide with the maturation of chloroplasts,and the associated switch to photoautotrophic growth(Kubasek et al., 1992). Subsequent work showed that, inthe presence of 2% sucrose, and in the absence of inhibi-tors, anthocyanin accumulation reaches a maximum in 5-day-old seedlings (Cottage et al., 2010). In addition to thepresence of disaccharides, the induction of anthocyaninsdepends on a functional photosynthetic electron transportchain and on light (Jeong et al., 2010). Thus, the light-sig-naling mutants cry1 and hy5 exhibit significant inhibitionof anthocyanin accumulation (Ahmad et al., 1995; Jeonget al., 2010). Notably, cry1 and hy5 mutants have beenidentified as gun mutants (Ruckle et al., 2007), and lowerlevels of anthocyanins were noted in the original set(gun1–gun5) in this present study and in other studies(Cottage et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2010). The idea thatchanges in anthocyanin accumulation might trigger de-re-pression of LHCB1.2 in gun mutants has previously beenrejected (Voigt et al., 2010); however, the consistent obser-vation of lowered anthocyanin accumulation in mutantsshowing the gun phenotype prompted us to re-evaluateTable 1 Differential expression of ABA-responsive genes, andgenes involved in chloroplast biogenesis and light reactions in 5-day-old irx3-2 mutant seedlings, compared with Col-0LocusidentifierFoldchange DescriptionGenesymbolChloroplastAT2G20570 1.47 GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 GLK1AT1G61520 1.33 PSI CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 3LHCA3AT3G47470 1.39 PSI CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN A4LHCA4AT1G29910 1.36 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 3LHCB1.2AT2G34430 1.41 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN B1LHCB1.4AT2G05100 1.51 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 2.1LHCB2.1AT2G05070 1.63 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 2.2LHCB2.2AT3G27690 1.53 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 2.3LHCB2.3AT5G54270 1.47 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 3LHCB3.1AT4G10340 1.33 PSII CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN 5LHCB5AT4G27440 1.32 PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDEOXIDOREDUCTASE BPORBAT4G28750 1.46 PSI SUBUNIT E-1 PSAE-1AT1G52230 1.40 PSI SUBUNIT H2 PSAH2AT1G08380 1.40 PSI SUBUNIT O PSAOATCG00220 1.40 PSII SUBUNIT M PSBMAT4G05180 1.36 PSII SUBUNIT Q-2 PSBQ-2AT2G30570 1.33 PSII SUBUNIT W PSBWAT1G67740 1.35 PSII SUBUNIT Y PSBYABA-responsiveAT2G42540 3.44 COLD-REGULATED 15A COR15AAT2G42530 3.17 COLD REGULATED 15B COR15BAT1G29395 2.83 COLD REGULATED 314INNER MEMBRANE 1COR413IM1AT5G15970 1.98 Stress-induced proteinKIN2/COLD-REGULATED 6.6KIN2AT1G52400 2.19 BETA GLUCOSIDASE 18 BGLU18AT4G04020 1.61 FIBRILLIN FBN1AAT4G23600 2.74 CORONATINE INDUCED 1 CORI3AT4G28520 4.52 CRUCIFERIN 3 CRU3AT5G25980 3.52 GLUCOSIDEGLUCOHYDROLASE 2TGG2AT5G44120 4.67 CRUCIFERINA CRA1Seedlings were grown on MS without supplementation of LIN.Differential expression was determined with RNA-Seq analysis(Tables S2 and S3) and fold changes are represented.

Because anthocyanins represent the onlyvisibly perceptible products of the phenylpropanoid path-way, we performed reverse-phase UPLC to profile theaccumulation of phenylpropanoids that absorb in the UVregion (280 nm) of the spectrum (Figure S3; Table S1) andfound that the kaempferol derivative k3 is less abundant ingun mutants after inhibitor treatment. A second approachusing various mutants blocked at different steps in thephenylpropanoid pathway (Figures 6 and 7) strongly sug-gests that neither the abundance of k3 nor that of anyother intermediate of the phenylpropanoid pathway is cor-related with LHCB1.2 expression, however. Therefore, ourdata suggest that changes in phenylpropanoid levels can-not account for LHCB1.2 de-repression in inhibitor-treatedgun mutants.Of all the mutants identified here, holi6 displayed thestrongest chlorophyll autofluorescence when grown in thepresence of low LIN (Figures 2 and 8). HOLI6 encodes the cel-lulose synthase subunit CESA7, also named IRX3, because inirx mutants the xylem collapses (Brown et al., 2005). Furtherresults indicated that perturbation of cellulose formationspecifically in the secondary cell wall leads to a happy-on-lin-comycin phenotype (Figure 7). This may seem counterintu-itive, but the weakening of the cell wall caused by defects inIRX1, IRX3 or IRX5 also confers enhanced resistance to somepathogens (Hernandez-Blanco et al., 2007; Miedes et al.,2014). In analogy to our findings that the rsw1-1mutant witha defect in the primary cell wall is not able to green on LIN(Figure 7), susceptibility to these pathogens was not alteredin mutants that affect the primary cell wall, like the cesa3 andrsw1 mutants (Hernandez-Blanco et al., 2007), although ce-sa3 mutants can be more resistant to other pathogens (Elliset al., 2002). Could this mean that a weakened secondary cellwall might confer resistance to lincomycin? Presumably not,because the chlorophyll content of irx3 mutants is alreadyhigher than that of the WT under normal growth conditions(Figure 8). Moreover, the disease resistance phenotype ofirx1, irx3 and irx5 mutants has been attributed in part to theconstitutive activation of plant immune responses ratherthan to alterations in the passive wall barrier. In irx1-6 andirx5-5 plants a large number of ABA-regulated genes are con-stitutively upregulated (Hernandez-Blanco et al., 2007), whichis in agreement with an increased accumulation of ABA inthe irx1-6 mutant (Chen et al., 2005). Accordingly, we foundthat, in the irx3-2mutant, ABA-responsive genes are upregu-lated under normal growth conditions (Figure 8). ABA haspreviously been shown to have an impact on LHCB1.2, plas-tid-encoded gene expression (Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Voigtet al., 2010; Yamburenko et al., 2013) and plastid differentia-tion (Rohde et al., 2000; Penfield et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009).ABA seems to affect plastid differentiation in opposing ways.High concentrations suppress the expression of certainnucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins as well as plastid for-mation in etiolated and light-grown seedlings, and inseedlings grown in the presence of NF (Penfield et al., 2006;Koussevitzky et al., 2007), whereas lower concentrationsstimulate these processes (Voigt et al., 2010; Kim et al.,2012). The tetrapyrrole biosynthesis proteins GUN4 andGUN5 (Voigt et al., 2010), the PPR protein GUN1 (Cottageet al., 2010) and GREENING AFTER EXTENDED DARKNESS 1(GED1) (Choy et al., 2008) all enhance seedling developmentin the presence of ABA. Interestingly, the ged1 mutant wasidentified in a further attempt to isolate gun1-like mutants(Gray et al., 2003; Choy et al., 2008); however, like holi6, ged1is not a true gun mutant, because RBCS and LHCB1 mRNAlevels are already elevated in the absence of inhibitors, andged1 shows only a very subtle gun phenotype upon treat-ment with NF or LIN (Choy et al., 2008).The phenomenon of signaling from an altered cell wallto influence seedling photomorphogenesis in the dark hasbeen recognized in the case of sugar- (Li et al., 2007) andzinc-responsive (Sinclair et al., 2017) growth and develop-ment. Our results suggest that defects in secondary cellwalls also generate signals that modify nuclear geneexpression and promote seedling greening, possibly viaaltered ABA metabolism or sensing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant material and growth conditionsThe mutant lines used in this study are listed in Table S4. Theirx3-2 mutant was genotyped with the following primers:SAIL_885_D10_LP, 50-AAGGTTGGATCATGCAAGATG-30; SAIL_885_D10_RP, 50-CCAGCTGCAATTTCGAGATAC-30, and LB, 50- ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC-30. Surface-sterilized seeds were sown onMurashige and Skoog plates containing 0.8% (w/v) agar (pH 5.8),and stratified for at least 2 days at 4°C. The growth medium con-tained 1% (w/v) sucrose, unless indicated otherwise. Seedlingswere grown at 22°C under continuous illumination (100 lmol pho-tons m2 sec1) provided by white fluorescent lamps or at 31°Cunder continuous illumination (80 lmol photons m2 sec1provided by LEDs, which corresponds to 100 lmol pho-tons m2 sec1 provided by white fluorescent lamps). For inhibitorexperiments, MS medium was supplemented with the indicatedconcentration of lincomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united-kingdom.html) or norflurazon (Sigma-Aldrich).EMS mutagenesis and whole-genome resequencingCol-0 seeds were mutagenized using 0.2% (v/v) EMS (Sigma-Aldrich). The mutagenized M1 plants were grown in pools of 500to produce the M2 generation of seeds. M2 plants were screenedfor holi or hon phenotypes. Segregating F2 populations were gen-erated by backcrossing holi or hon mutants with the parental Col-0 line. To identify the causative mutations, positive pools of 50plants each were selected based on their holi or hon mutant phe-notype. DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIA-GEN, https://www.qiagen.com). Preparation of 350-bp insert DNAlibraries and 150-bp paired-end sequencing was carried out atNovogene Biotech (https://en.novogene.com) on an IlluminaHiSeq 2500 system (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com) with stan-dard Illumina protocols.

After grooming FASTQ files,adaptors were removed with TRIMMOMATIC (Bolger et al., 2014),reads were mapped with BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), with parame-ters ‘mem -t 4 -k 32 -M’ to the TAIR10 annotation, and duplicateswere removed by SAMTOOLS (Li et al., 2009) with the RMDUP tool. Sin-gle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using SAM-TOOLS (Li et al., 2009) with the parameter ‘mpileup -m 2 -F 0.002 -d1000’. Only SNPs that were supported by more than four readswith a mapping quality of > 20 were retained. To identify the SNPsspecific for the holi and hon mutants, the SNPs between each ofthe holi and hon mutants were compared with the SNPs of ourCol-0 strain. The resulting holi- and hon-specific SNP lists weresubjected to the web application CandiSNP (Etherington et al.,2014), which generates SNP density plots. The output list of Can-diSNP was screened for non-synonymous amino acid changesand for the G/CA/T transitions that were likely to be caused byEMS, with a special focus on the chromosome with the highestSNP density with an allele frequency of > 0.75.Detection of chlorophyll autofluorescenceChlorophyll autofluorescence of cotyledons was recorded with aLumar V12 microscope equipped with the filter set Lumar 09 (no.485009) connected to an AxioCam digital camera (Zeiss, https://www.zeiss.com).Chlorophyll fluorescence measurementsChlorophyll fluorescence was detected using an imaging Chl fluo-rometer (Imaging PAM, M-Series; Walz, https://www.walz.com)equipped with the computer-operated PAM control unit IMAGE-MAXI,as described previously (Xu et al., 2019).Chlorophyll concentration measurementsFor chlorophyll extraction, the cotyledons were blotted with filterpaper to remove excess water, and hypocotyls were removed toensure that only chlorophyll from the cotyledons was extracted.Briefly, 50-mg (fresh weight) cotyledon samples were ground andchlorophyll was extracted by adding 4 ml of 80% (v/v) acetone toeach sample.
