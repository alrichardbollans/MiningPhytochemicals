Do extrato metanólico de frutos verdes foram isolados três alcalóides esteroidais glicosilados: solamargina (13), 20-epi-solamargina (14) e solasonina (16). Os derivados 3,5,7,4’-tetra-O-metil-kaempferol (4), 3,7,4’-tri-O-metil-kaempferol (5), 3,7,4’-tri-O-metil-5-O-acetil-kaempferol (6), peracetil-epi-solamargina (15) e peracetil-solasonina (17) foram sintetizados e estão sendo registrados pela primeira vez na literatura. As estruturas foram definidas através de análise de dados espectrométricos. The phytochemical investigation of Solanum crinitum Lam led to the isolation from the fruit trichomes of four flavonoids, tiliroside (1), astragalin (2), kaempferol (3), biochanin A-7-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→5)-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-b-D-glucopyranoside (7), along with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (12), and four cinnamic acid derivatives, cis- and trans-coumaric acids (10 and 11) and cis- and trans- ethyl coumarate (8 and 9). Three tri-glycosyl-steroidal alkaloids, solamargine (13), 20-epi-solamargine (14) and solasonine (16) were isolated from the methanolic extract of the green fruits. The derivatives 3,5,7,4’-tretra-O-methyl-kaempferol (4), 3,7,4’-tri-O-methyl-kaempferol (5), 3,7,4’-tri-O-methyl-5-O-acetyl-kaempferol (6), the peracetyl-epi-solamargine (15) and peracetyl-solasonine (17) were prepared. The structures were established through the analysis of their spectral data. The complete 1H and 13C NMR data assignments of the new peracetyl derivatives of the alkaloids were made. Keywords: Solanum crinitum, Solanaceae, steroidal glycoalkaloids, flavonoids, cinnamic acidsIntroductionSolanum (L) is the most representative genus of Solanaceae, containing about 1,500 species, and 5,000 epithets. It is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of all the world, but its highest diversity occurs in South America.1 Solanum species are a rich source of steroidal alkaloids, flavonoids and their glycosides which are known to possess a variety of biological activities. The glycoalkaloids are natural toxins with ecological and human health importance, such as the allelopathic effect against herbivores, against pathogenic microorganism2,3 and molluscicidal activity,4 and are also of interest as starting material for anabolic, anti-fertility, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic drugs.5 As the alkaloids, the flavonoids are a frequent group of compounds in Solanum species, and can be used as systematic markers for the family taxons.6-8Solanum crinitum Lam (Solanaceae), popularly known as “jurubeba” and “fruto-de-lobo”, is a shrub or small tree in South America, including southern Brazil and Colombia.9,10 In the course of our pharmacological and phytochemical investigations of Solanum species,3,4,8,11-13 we have reported the cytotoxic and antitumoral activities of flavonoids isolated from trichomes of young branches Other Chemical Constituents Isolated from Solanum crinitum Lam. (Solanaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2212and also of a rich glycoalkaloids total fraction from the green fruits of Solanum crinitum Lam14 along with its allelopathic activity.3 This work describes the isolation and structural characterization of the flavonoids tiliroside (1), astragalin (2), kaempferol (3) and biochanin A-7-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→5)-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-b-D-glucopyranoside (7), cis- (10) and trans- (11) cumaric acids and ethyl cis- (8) and trans- (9) cumarate and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (12), which were isolated from the trichomes, and the glycoalkaloids solamargine (13), 20-epi-solamargine (14) and solasonine (16) isolated from the green fruits. The derivatives 3,5,7,4’-tetra-O-methyl-kaempferol (4), 3,7,4’-tri-O-methyl-kaempferol (5), 3,7,4’-tri-O-methyl-5-O-acetyl-kaempferol (6), peracetyl-epi-solamargine (15) and peracetyl-solasonine (17) were prepared and used to confirm the structures of the natural compounds. The structures were established through analysis of their spectral data, mainly NMR (1D and 2D) and mass spectra. NMR data for the new acetyl derivatives of the alkaloids are described herein for the first time. Cornelius et al. 2213Vol. 21, No. 12, 2010Results and DiscussionFrom the trichomes isolated from green fruits of Solanum crinitum Lam were isolated the flavonoids: tiliroside (1), astragalin (2), kaempferol (3), and biochanin A-7-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→5)-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-b-D-glucopyranoside (7), cis- (10) and trans- (11) cumaric acids and ethyl cis- (8) and trans- (9) cumarate esters and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (12); from green fruits methanolic extracts were isolated three tri-glycosyl-steroidal alkaloids, solamargine (13), 20-epi-solamargine (14) and solasonine (16). The derivatives 3,5,7,4’-tetramethylkaempferol (4), 3,7,4’-trimethylkaempferol (5), 3,7,4’-trimethyl-5-acetylkaempferol (6), the peracetyl-20-epi-solamargine (15) and peracetyl-solasonine (17) were prepared. The structures were established on the basis of IR, NMR and MS data analysis of the natural compounds and of the derivatives 4-6, 15 and 17. Compounds 1-3 were identified by the analysis of 1H and 13C NMR spectra, including HMQC and HMBC experiments, and comparison with literature data for tiliroside, kaempferol and astragalin.15-18 The first report of 1 in Solanum species was made by Souza et al.14 Kaempferol and astragalin have been isolated from some Solanum species.8 The treatment of 3 with diazomethane yielded the methyl derivatives 4 and 5, described in the literature,19 and the derivative 6 was obtained by treating 5 with Ac2O/Pyridine. The 2D NMR spectra, including NOESY experiments, of these derivatives were used to confirm the proposed structure of 3 and to carry out the complete assignment of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of 6 (see Experimental). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 7 revealed characteristic resonances of the isoflavonoid biochanin A besides additional signals for three sugars unities, one glucopyranoside and two apiofuranosides. Comparison of these data with those of glycosides isolated from Dalbergia nigra20 and Andira anthelmia,21 besides the analysis of mass spectrum obtained by FAB-MS in positive mode {m/z 733.20820 ([M+Na]+, C32H38O18+Na+, calc.: m/z 733.19558), m/z 601.12300 [M+Na-132]+, m/z 451.0600 (M+Na-282)+, m/z 449.27710 [M+Na-284]+, m/z 431.16210 [M+Na-302]+, m/z 317.1338 [M+Na-416]+, m/z 287.0865 [M+Na-446]+}, led us to identify the compound as biochanin A, 7-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→5)-b-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-b-D-glucopyranoside (7). This is the first report of this apiofuranosyl derivative in Solanum species. Compounds 8-12 were identified by the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data analysis of the mixtures of 8+9, 10+11 and of 12 along with comparison with literature data.21-25 The integration of the 1H NMR signals allowed us to calculate the approximate relative percentage of both compounds: 36.16% of 8 and 63.84% of 9. The fractions containing compounds 13, 14 and 16 showed a positive test for alkaloids. The detailed analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the isolated compounds allowed to identify characteristic signals corresponding to the same aglycone as that of the steroidal spirazolane-type alkaloid in the three glycoalkaloids: four quaternary carbon atoms, including one linked to oxygen and nitrogen atoms: (dC 98.7 to 98.5 and one sp2 at dC 141.2 to 140.4), nine methine groups (including two oxygenated at dC 78.5 to 78.0 and 81.1 to 78.6), ten methylene groups and four methyl groups = (C)3(O-C-NH)(CH)7 (HC-O)2(CH2)10(CH3)4 = C27H42NO3 = C27H42NO2 considering the presence of an ether function (Table 1) having a trisaccharide moiety (three anomeric carbon atoms: dC 100.6 to 100.3) attached to the oxygen atom of carbon CH-3, with dC 78.5 to 78.0 (Table 1 and 2), which is significantly higher when compared with the 13C chemical shift of the methyl carbon CH-3 sustaining free hydroxyl group (about dC 71). The 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the trisaccharide moieties of 13 and 14, had practically the same values (Table 2), indicating identical the partial structure O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)]-b-D-glucopyranoside = C18H32O13 (three degrees of unsaturation, C18H38O13 – C18H32O13 = H6). On the other hand, the 1H and 13C signals observed in NMR spectra of 16 allowed to characterize the trisaccharide as O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-[b-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)]-b-D-galactopyranoside = C18H32O14 (three degrees of unsaturation, C18H38O14 – C18H32O14 = H6). All these NMR spectral data allowed to deduce the same molecular formulas C45H73NO15 to 13 and 14 and C45H73NO16 to 16, all with ten degrees of unsaturation corresponding to one double bond and six rings). In fact, the values of pseudomolecular peaks in the positive HRMS spectra at m/z 868.5239 (M + H•+, 100%) of 13 (C45H74NO15 = m/z 868.5058) and at m/z 868.5305 (M + H•+, 100%) of 14 (C45H74NO15 = m/z 868.5058), besides additional peaks compatible with loss of sugar moieties, were used to confirm the molecular formula of these isomeric compounds (13 and 14). The hydrogen and carbon atoms signals observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 13-17 (Tables 1 and 3) were also assigned with aid of the homonuclear 2D 1H-1H-COSY and heteronuclear 2D HMQC (1H-13C-COSY-1JCH) and HMBC (1H-13C-COSY-nJCH, n = 2 and 3), allowing to identify the 1H chemical shifts of the methyl group signals of the aglycone and of the trisaccharide moieties (Table 3 and 4): dH 0.83 (d, 3H-27), 0.88 (s, 3H-18), 1.07 (s, 3H-19) and 1.09 (d, 3H-21) of 13, 0.79 (d, 3H-27), 0.85 (s, 3H-18), 1.06 (s, Other Chemical Constituents Isolated from Solanum crinitum Lam. (Solanaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.22143H-19) and 1.28 (d, 3H-21) of 14, and 0.76 (d, 3H-27), 0.82 (s, 3H-18), 1.03 (s, 3H-19) and 1.17 (d, 3H-21) of 16; signals of the hydrogen H-6 linked to sp2 carbons of double bounds at dH: 5.32 (13), 5.33 (14), 5.30 (16), besides the signals of H-16 located in the spyrazolane ring (d, J 6 Hz) at dH 4.42 (13); 4.82 (14) and 4.21 (16). The additional doublets (J 6 Hz) corresponding to methyl groups were revealed at d3H 1.64 and d3H 1.78 in the spectra of 13 and 14 suggested the presence of two rhamnose moieties in both compounds and only one rhamnose for 16 as indicated by signal at dH 1.78. The differences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 13 and 14, recorded in same apparatus (1H: 500 MHz; 13C: 125 MHz) and solvent pyridine-d5, involving mainly the chemical shifts of the hydrogen atoms H-16 (dH 4.42 and 4.82), H-17 (dH 1.78 and 2.02), H-20 (dH 1.98 and 2.14), 2H-26 (dH 2.78 and 3.04/2.89) and 3H-21 (dH 1.09 and 1.28), which revealed correlation in the HMQC with the 13C signals of the corresponding carbon atoms: CH-16 (dC 79.2 and 81.1), CH-17 (dC 63.9 and 63.0), CH-20 (dC 42.0 and 42.0), CH2-26 (dC 48.2 and 47.1) and 3H-21 (dC 16.1 and 15.7), as summarized in Figure 1. Comparative analysis of these data was used to suggest the two stereoisomers H-20b (13) and H-20a (14), since the 22aN and 22bN possibilities were eliminated considering the absence of 13C signal corresponding to a methylene carbon CH2-23 at about dC 27 which is consistent with the 13C NMR chemical shift of the 22bN stereoisomer (Figure 1). The b-position of the methyl Me-21 located at carbon atom 20 of 14 may be used to justify the 13C chemical shifts of the CH-16 (dC 81.1, absence of the g-effect from Me-21) and CH2-23 (dC 34.0, presence of the g-effect from Me-21).26-30 In order to compare the relative stabilities of the epimeric structures 13/14, a molecular modeling study was implemented using the Spartan 06 for Linux program (Wavefunction, Inc.), see Supplementary Information.31The complete 1H and 13C chemical shift assignments of the signals of CH3, CH2, CH and C observed in the 1H (including 1H-1H-COSY) and 13C ({1H} and DEPT) NMR spectra (including 2D experiments HMQC and HMBC) (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4) and comparison with values described in the literature for solamargine (13)26-29 and solasonine (16)28,31 led to the proposition of the structures (25R)(20S)(16S)-3b-{O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)]-b-D-glucopyranosyl}-22aN-spirosol-5-en (solamargine, 13), the new glycoalkaloid (25R)(20R)(16S)-3b-{O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)]-b-D-glucopyranosyl}-22aN-spirosol-5-en (16-epi-solamargine, 14), and (25R)(20S)(16S)-3b-{O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-[b-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)]-b-D-galactopyranosyl} -22aN-spirosol-5-en (solasonine, 16) for the three steroidal glycoalkaloids isolated from this plant (Figure 1). Figure 1. Comparative analysis of the chemical shifts corresponding to the hydrogen (dH) and carbon (dC) atoms CH-16, CH-17, CH-20, CH3-21, C-22, CH2-23 and CH2-26 of 13 and 14, including comparison of the dC these carbon atoms and of the CH2-24 to reveal the structural distinction between solamargine and b-solamarine. Cornelius et al. 2215Vol. 21, No. 12, 2010The natural alkaloids 14 and 16 were treated with Ac2O/pyridine to yield the peracetyl derivatives 15 and 17. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of these peracetyl derivatives (15 and 17), obtained through the analysis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments (Tables 1-4), were also used to confirm the postulated structures to 14 and 16. The analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra was also used to make the complete hydrogen and carbon-13 chemical shift assignments for the alkaloid, the new 16-epi-solamargine (14) and for the two peracetyl derivatives 15 and 17.ExperimentalGeneral procedureMelting points have not been corrected. IR, NMR and mass spectra were recorded on the same equipments used in previous papers.21,32 Column chromatography was carried out with silica gel (Vetec and Aldrich 0.05-0.20 mm) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma, USA); silica gel F254 G (Vetec) was used for preparative TLC; aluminum backed (Sorbent) silica gel plates W/UV254 were used for analytical TLC, with visualization under UV (254 and 366 nm), with AlCl3-ETOH (1%), Liebermann-Burchard and/or Godin reagents, or exposure to iodine vapor.Plant materialThe green fruits of Solanum crinitum Lam. were collected in September, 2001, in the campus of Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), Seropédica-RJ, Brazil. They were collected by M.Sc. José Milton Alves (Agronomy Institute, UFRRJ). The identification was made by Dr. Maria de Fátima Agra, Laboratório de Tecnologia Farmacêutica, Universidade Federal da Paraíba, João Pessoa-PB. A voucher specimen (No. JP-28000) was deposited at the Herbarium Prof. Lauro Pires Xavier, Universidade Federal da Paraíba, João Pessoa-PB, Brazil. Extraction and isolationThe trichomes (9.7 g) were isolated by scraping the green fruits with a glass slide and were subsequently extracted with CHCl3 and MeOH in an ultrasound bath to furnish the CHCl3 extract (310.0 mg) and MeOH (3.0 g) residues. The CHCl3 residue was chromatographed on a sephadex CC, using MeOH as eluent, and 13 fractions were collected and analyzed by TLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fractions 7-8 yielded astragaline (1, 10.0 mg) and fractions 9-10 yielded the tilirozide (2, 25.0 mg). The methanolic extract was chromatographed on a silica gel column (col A) and 20 fractions were collected and analyzed by TLC plate. Fractions 5-8 (2.0 g) were dissolved in methanol and addition of CH2Cl2 yielded a precipitate that was separated by filtration to afford a solid (1.6 g) that was identified as kaempferol (3, mp 282-284 oC) and the mother liquor (AM-5-8). The reaction of kaempferol (65.0 mg) with diazomethane yielded 16.1 mg of 4 (mp 128-130 oC) and 36.6 mg of 5 (mp 140-142 °C) that were separated by preparative TLC. 20.3 mg of 5 were treated with Ac2O/pyridine (1:1) to afford 6 (14.8 mg, mp 166-168 °C). The mother liquor (AM 5-8, 360.0 mg) was submitted to silica Table 1. 13C NMR spectral data for aglycone of 13, 14 and 16 in pyridine-d5 (125 MHz: 13 and 14; 50 MHz: 16) and of peracetyl derivatives 15 and 17 in CDCl3 (125 MHz)*C 13 14 15a 16 17a1 (CH2) 37.9 37.5 37.3 37.6 37.12 (CH2) 30.5 30.2 29.7 30.2 29.53 (CH) 78.5 78.0 79.3 78.4 79.84 (CH2) 39.3 39.0 38.4 38.8 38.45 (C) 141.2 140.4 140.4 141.0 140.26 (CH) 122.2 121.9 122.2 121.8 121.97 (CH2) 32.1 32.3 31.8 32.3 31.68 (CH) 32.0 31.7 31.6 31.8 31.49 (CH) 50.7 50.3 50.3 50.3 50.010 (C) 37.5 37.2 36.9 37.2 36.711 (CH2) 21.5 21.1 21.0 21.2 20.612 (CH2) 40.5 39.7 40.0 39.9 39.813 (C) 41.0 40.8 42.9 40.8 42.714 (CH) 57.0 56.5 53.0 56.6 54.815 (CH2) 32.9 32.6 31.6 32.6 31.616 (CH) 79.2 81.1 75.9 78.6 75.617 (CH) 63.9 63.0 62.1 63.2 62.018 (CH3) 16.9 16.4 12.8 16.5 12.419 (CH3) 19.8 19.4 19.4 19.5 20.320 (CH) 42.0 42.0 40.0 41.9 39.721 (CH3) 16.1 15.7 21.1 15.8 21.422 (C) 98.7 98.5 99.7 98.5 99.223 (CH2) 35.0 34.0 35.2 34.3 35.024 (CH2) 31.4 30.0 30.1 30.5 30.825 (CH) 32.1 31.7 29.1 30.8 28.926 (CH2) 48.2 47.1 45.5 47.5 45.227 (CH3) 20.1 19.2 18.5 19.5 19.2* Number of hydrogens bound to carbon atoms deduced by comparative analysis of {1H}- and DEPT-13C NMR spectra. 2D 1H-1H-COSY and 1H-13C-nJCH (n = 2 and 3) NMR spectra were also used in these assignments; a dCOCH3: 170.1-170.2 (CO), 23.8 (CH3).Other Chemical Constituents Isolated from Solanum crinitum Lam.

Fraction 10 (850 mg) from col A was chromatographed on a silica gel column and 130 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Fractions 32-40 yielded 35.5 mg of a material corresponding to the mixture of 10, 11 and 12. Fractions 94-114 (102.3 mg) were chromatographed on a silica gel column and fractions 3-5 yielded 7 (9.5 mg) after filtration on Sephadex LH20. The green fruits (2.6 g) of Solanum crinitum Lam were powdered and extracted with ethanol + acetic acid (2%) and 900 mL of solution was obtained. 900 mL of acetic acid (10%) were added, and the solution was left to stand and chill overnight. The solution was filtered under vacuum using Hirsch funnel. NH4OH (pH 9-10) was added to the filtrate which was allowed to stand overnight in the fridge affording a precipitate (96.4 g) corresponding to the glycoalkaloids fraction was obtained. 90 g of the glycoalkaloids was adsorbed on silica gel and applied on a silica gel column, eluted with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol. 14 fractions of 500 mL were collected. Fraction 8 (1.0 g), collected with ethyl acetate, was chromatographed in a silica gel CC and fractions analyzed by silica gel TLC plate. Fraction 84 (52.6 mg) from this column was filtered on a Sephadex LH20 column, eluted with methanol, and the alkaloid solamargine 13 (268-270 °C) was obtained.

(Solanaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc.S8Molecular Modeling In order to compare the relative stabilities of the epimeric structures 13/14, a molecular modeling study was implemented using the Spartan 06 for Linux program (Wavefunction, Inc.). Because the long chain attached to C-3 should only have a small influence on the relative stabilities, it was replaced by a methoxy group to reduce the computational cost for the calculations. The conformer distribution of the resulting alpha and beta epimer models (13a and 14a) was determined with the Monte Carlo approach using the MMFF molecular mechanics force field. The most stable conformers of 13a and 14a were submitted to a previous energy minimization with the PM3 semi empirical method.31 The PM3 optimized structures were then submitted to a complete energy minimization with the B3LYP/6-31G* DFT method. The B3LYP method was chosen because it usually yields results for many properties in close agreement with those obtained from MP calculations, and is more efficient than conventional ab initio correlated methods for larger-scale calculations. The possibility of existence of this epimer as a stable species was verified by a molecular modeling study at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G* level with models of both epimers. The b-epimer model at C-20 (14a) is less stable than the a-epimer one (13a), but the energy difference between both structures is only 4.85 kcal mol-1 (20.30 kJ mol-1), as calculated with the B3LYP/6-31G* DFT method. Because of this small energy difference, the b-epimer is expected to exist in appreciable amount in an equilibrium mixture with the more stable a-epimer. The main reason for the lower stability of the b-epimer should be the proximity between the C-21 methyl group and carbons C-23 and C-18. The corresponding C-C distances, which are equal to 4.22 Å and 3.47 Å, respectively, in 13a, are considerably shorter in 14a, 3.43 Å and 2.98 Å, respectively. This closer proximity would raise more unfavorable steric interactions in 14a than in 13a (Figure S15).Figure S14. 1H NMR spectrum (a) and expansion (b) (400 MHz, CDCl3) of 17.Cornelius et al.
