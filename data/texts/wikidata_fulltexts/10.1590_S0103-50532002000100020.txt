4’”)-5”,7”-dihydroxyflavanone. The structures were established from spectral data, including 2D-
NMR experiments of the natural substances and of the acetyl and methyl ether derivatives of the new
biflavone.
Keywords:  Luxemburgia nobilis, Ochnaceae, flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes
Introduction
The Ochnaceae family has been characterized as a
major source of biflavonoids and up to now it has been
best represented by Ouratea,1-5 Ochna6-9 and Lophira10-12
genera. In a previous report, we described the inhibition of
murine tumor growth, antiproliferative effects and
activation of apoptosis on Erlich tumor cells by flavones
isolated from Ouratea hexasperma13 and from Ouratea
semisserrata.14 There is only one record of a phytochemical
work on a Luxemburgia genus where we described the
isolation and identification of steroids, fatty acids,
betulinic acid, the diterpene epimanoyl oxid, atranorin
and two new triglycerides.15
In this paper, we report the structure determination of a
new biflavonoid, 2”,3”-dihydroochnaflavone, two known
biflavones, amentoflavone and robustaflavone, the
flavonoids rutin, epicatechin, and two chalcones, along
with fatty acids, sitosterol, 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-
sitosterol and five pentacyclic triterpenes isolated from
the branches and leaves of L. nobilis.
Results and Discussion
The chromatographic fractionation of the methanol
extract from the branches and also of the hexane, ethyl
acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of L. nobilis
afforded hexadecanoic, eicosanoic and tetraeicosanoic
acids, a new biflavonoid, 2”,3”-dihydroochnaflavone (1);
two known biflavones, amentoflavone (2) and robusta-
flavone (3); epicatechin (4); two chalcones, isoli-
quiritigenin (5) and 3’-hydroxyisoliquiritigenin (6); rutin
(7); sitosterol (8); sitosterol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (9);
friedelin (10); friedelinol (11) and a mixture of lupeol (12),
α-amyrin (13) and β-amyrin (14).
The 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1 shows 28
signals including two signals at δCH 128.80 and 116.30,
each representing two carbon atoms, eight sp2 CH, two sp3
carbons (δCH 78.57 and  δCH2 42.38), fourteen sp2 quaternary
carbons (4xC and 10xC-O) and two carbonyl groups (δC
182.22 and 196.48). The 1H NMR spectrum shows two
Oliveira et al.120 J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
signals at δ 11.99 and 12.71 indicating the presence of
two chelated hydroxyls, which were confirmed by the IR
spectrum which exhibits a broad OH absorption band at
3495 cm-1 and also a chelated carbonyl absorption at
1646 cm-1. The NMR spectrum shows ten aromatic
hydrogen signals including two sets of meta-coupled
doublets (1H,1H-COSY) at δ 6.11 and 6.37 (2.0 Hz) and
δ 5.81 and 5.82 (2.1 Hz) which belong to the H-6 and H-8
atoms of two flavonoid moieties. These data are in
agreement with a flavonoid dimeric structure. The
molecular formula C30H20O10, which was obtained by
HREIMS m/z [M+, 30] 540.10565 (calc. 540.10050 for
C30H20O10) confirms the latter observation. The presence
of a singlet at δ 6.62 (one hydrogen) and three double
doublets at δ 5.39 (16.6, and 12.7 Hz), 3.11 (16.6, 12.7 Hz)
and 2.66 (16.6, 6.0 Hz) led us to propose a flavone and
flavanone unit for the dimer. The data above imply that
carbons 6 and 8 of each unit are not involved in the
interflavonoid linkage. Ring B of the flavone unit was
identified by three hydrogen signals at δ 7.06 (d, 8.7 Hz),
7.62 (d, 2.0 Hz) and 7.80 (dd, 8.7 and 2,0 Hz) corresponding
to H-5’, H-2’and H-6’of this moiety. Furthermore, the 1H
NMR spectrum also shows a set of AA’BB’ doublets (J 7.8
Hz, 2H each) at δ 7.36 and 6.83 which were assigned to H-
2”’,6”’ and H-3”’,5”’ of the flavanone moiety, respectively.
The cross peaks observed in the 13C,1H-COSY-nJCH (n = 2
and 3, HMBC) spectra of 1 show heteronuclear long-range
couplings of C-1’with H-5’ and of C-1”’ with H-3”’,5”’
which confirm rings B of both flavone and flavanone,
respectively. These observations and comparison of the
UV absorption maxima (288 and 332 nm) and NMR data
with those of the biflavonoid 2,3-dihydroochnaflavone,
isolated from Ochna obtusata,6 revealed these to be
identical compounds. The differences between the
chemical shift of the AA’BB’ hydrogen in 1 [δ 7.36 and
6.83 (d, 7.8 Hz, 2H each)] and the values for the same set
for the 2,3-dihydroochnaflavone reported in the literature6
[δ 8.03 and 7.08 (d, 9.0 Hz, 2H)] led to propose the 2”,3”-
Table 1. ¹H (500 MHz) and ¹³C (125 MHz) NMR spectra data for biflavonoid 1 (D3COD) and its trimethyl ether derivative 1a (D3CCOCD3).
Chemical shifts are in δ (ppm) and coupling constants (J, in parenthesis) in Hz.

dihydroochnaflavone structure for 1. The treatment of 1
with diazomethane yielded 1a with three methoxy groups
and two chelated hydroxyls. The results obtained from
NOEDIFF-NMR experiments on this derivative, performed
with irradiation at the methoxy groups did not reveal any
signal enhancements at the doublet at δ 7.62 (d, 2.0 Hz,
H-2’) and at 7.36 (d, 7.80 Hz, H-3”’,5”’) but did show nOe
at the doublets at δ 7.06 (H-5’), 6.11 (H-6), 6.37 (H-8)
5.81(H-6”) and 5.82 (H-8”). These observations further
confirm the C-3’-O-C-4’” connection between the flavone
and flavanone moieties. The comparison of the 13C NMR
spectral data of 1 with those of 2,3-dihydroochnaflavone6
along with the analysis of the 13C,1H-COSY, nJCH (n = 1,
HMQC, Table 1; n = 2 and 3, HMBC) allowed to define the
structure of 1 as the new biflavonoid 4’,5,7-trihydroxy-
flavone-(3’-O-4”’)-5”,7”-dihydroxyflavanone or 2”,3”-
dihydroochnaflavone. The 1H and 13C-NMR data of 1b
were used to confirm the proposed structure.
Compounds 2, 3 and 4 were characterized as amento-
flavone, epicatechin and robustaflavone, respectively, with
the help of 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR analysis of the natural
substances and comparison with literature data.16-20
The molecular formulas of 5 and 6 were determined to
be C15H12O4 and C15H12O5 from the low-resolution mass
spectrum, which showed peaks at m/z 256 (5) and 272 (6),
in combination with the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra (HBBD
and DEPT). The 1D and 2D 1H (1H,1H-COSY and NOESY)
and 13C-NMR (HMQC and HMBC) spectra of the mixture
of 5 and 6 were analyzed and compared with those of
isoliquiritigenin (5) reported in the literature21. The
remaining hydrogen and carbon-13 signals observed in
the 1D and 2D NMR spectra along with the peak with m/z
172 in the mass spectrum were used to assign the additional
structure in the mixture as the chalcone 2,4,3’,4’-
tetrahydroxychalcone (6) registered in the literature.22
Compound 7 was characterized as rutin by 1D and 2D
1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis of the natural substances
and comparison with literature data.20 The treatment of 7
with diazomethane followed by treatment with Ac2O and
pyridine yielded 7a, with three methoxyl and seven acethyl
groups. The results obtained from NOEDIFF-NMR
experiments on this derivative performed with irradiation
at the methoxyl groups did not reveal signal enhancements
of hydrogens bound to anomeric carbons but showed nOe
at the doublets at δ 6.19 (H-6), 6.39 (H-8), 7.52-7.55 (H-2’)
and 6.84 (H-5’). These observations further confirm the C-

3-O-glycosyl moiety in the flavone and allowed to identify
7 as rutin.22,23
The known natural steroid 8, its glycoside 9 and the
terpenoids 10-14 were identified by analysis of their
spectral data including the acetyl derivative 9a and
comparison with literature values, mainly 13C NMR
chemical shifts described for sitosterol (8),24,25 sitosterol-
3O-β-D-glycopiranoside (9)26 and the mixture of lupeol,
α-amyrin and β-amyrin (12-14), friedelin (10) and
friedelinol (11) .27,28
Experimental
General procedure
Mp’s are uncorrected. NMR spectra in CD3OD (1, 2 ,3)
or CDCl3 (1a) were recorded on Bruker spectrometers (200
and 500 MHz for 1H and 50.3 and 125 MHz for 13C,
respectively) and on a Varian Unity 400 (400 MHz for 1H
and 100 MHz for 13C) spectrometer using TMS as internal
standard. EIMS: direct inlet at 70 eV on a VG Auto Spec-
300 spectrometer; CC: silica gel (Merck and Aldrich 0.05-
0.20 mm); TLC: silica gel H or G (Merck and Aldrich) was
used to analyse the fractions collected from CC with
visualization by UV (254 and 366) and exposure to iodine
vapor; UV: recorded in MeOH with a DMS 80 Varian
spectrophotometer; IR spectra were recorded on KBr disks
on a Perkin-Elmer 1420 spectrophotometer.
Plant material
Luxemburgia nobilis (Ochnaceae) was collected in
Morro de São Sebastião, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil
and authenticated by botanist Jorge L. Silva. A voucher
specimen (No 6737) is deposited at the Herbário José Badini
of the Instituto de Ciências Exatas e Biológicas of the
Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais state,
Brazil.
Extraction and isolation
Dried and powdered leaves and branches were
successively extracted by maceration using organic
solvents at room temperature. The solvents were removed
under vacuum to yield residues from Hexane (LNLH,
2.0 g), ethyl Acetate (LNLA, 17.7 g) and Methanol
(LNLM, 20 g) from the Leaves and Hexane (LNBH,
3.85 g) and Methanol (LNBM, 20.0 g) from the Branches
of L. nobilis. The LNLH residue was fractionated on a
silica gel column (A) using hexane, CH2Cl2 and methanol
increasing the polarity to 100% methanol. The A-1/4,
A-6/9 and A-31/35 fractions were crystallized and yielded
hexadecanoic acid (mp 68 °C, 200.0 mg, acetone), a mixture
of tetraeicosanoic and eicosanoic acids (130.0 mg, acetone)
and sitosterol (8, 97.0 mg, hexane). The LNLA residue
was chromatographed on a silica gel column (B) using
CH2Cl2/MeOH increasing the polarity to 100% MeOH.
The B-1/48 fractions were fractionated on a flash column
of silica gel using CHCl3 and yielded friedelin (10, mp
300 oC, 107.0 mg). Fractions B-49/54 and B-55/64 were
filtered on silica gel and sephadex columns using CHCl3/
MeOH (9:1) and afforded biflavone 2 (88.80 mg) and
biflavone 1 (130.0 mg), respectively. The LNLM residue
was fractionated on a silica gel column (C) using ethyl
acetate increasing the polarity to 100% methanol.
Fractions C-10/15 were filtered on a Sephadex column
and purified by preparative TLC using CHCl3/MeOH and
yielded triterpenes friedelinol (11, mp 301 oC, 45 mg) and
friedelin (10, 53 mg); fractions C-26/30 were dissolved in
methanol and after addition of CHCl3 afforded a precipitate
corresponding to the biflavone 3 (gum, 50.0 mg). Fractions
C-32-39 yielded 1 (mp 220 oC, 295.0 mg) after precipitation
from acetone. The work up of residue LNBH has been
previously described.15 Finally, LNBM residue was
subjected to column chromatography (D) on silica gel
using ethyl acetate/methanol increasing the polarity to
100% methanol. Fraction D-2 was purified with a silica
gel column and preparative TLC using CHCl3/MeOH (9:1)
to yield a mixture of triterpenes lupeol (12), β-amyrin (13)
and α-amyrin (14) (80.0 mg) besides epicatechin (4, oil,
30.0 mg). Fractions D-8/12 were filtered on a silica gel
column using CH2Cl2/MeOH (7:3) affording epicatechin
(4, 200 mg). Fractions D-18/20 yielded a residue identified
as 3O-βD-glucopyranosylsitosterol (9, mp 300 oC, 35.0 mg).
Filtration on sephadex column of fractions D-33/35 yielded
two fractions which were recrystallized from EtOAc:MeOH
(9:1) and further purified by preparative TLC affording
the same glycoside 9 (85.00 mg) and a mixture of chalcones
5 and 6. Compound 7 (1.00 g), known as rutin, was obtained
from filtration of D-36/63 with sephadex using MeOH as
solvent.
