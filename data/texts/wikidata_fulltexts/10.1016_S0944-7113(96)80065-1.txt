Summary 
Petroleum ether and methylene chloride extracts of Peperomia galioides and three prenylated 
diphenols, grifolic acid, grifolin and piperogalin exhibited in vitro antileishmanial activity. Dur- 
ing the course of infection of BALBlc mice with Leishmania amazomiisis, the treatments with 
each of these compounds did not influence the progression of the disease. 
ICey words: Peperomia galioides, prenylated diphenols, in vitro and in vivo leishmanicidal 
studies. 
Introduction 
Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects 12 million 
people in the world and 350 million at risk, of whom some 
1.5 to 2 million will be infected each year (World Health 
Organization, 1995). Pentavalent antimonials in the form 
of sodium stibogluconate (Pentosta") or meglumine anti- 
monate (Glucantime@) are the drugs of choice for treatment 
of all forms of leishmaniasis but require long- term therapy 
and often induce toxic effects. 
In Bolivia, we have developed a searching program for 
Bolivian plants containing new natural active compounds 
against leishmaniasis (Fournet et al., 1994) In the in vitro 
preliminar screening, the petroleum ether and chloroformic 
extracts of whole plant, Peperomia galioides H. B. IC. (Pi- 
peraceae) displayed activity at 25 pg/ml against three 
strains of Leishmania ssp., L. amazonemis, L. braziliensis 
and L. donovaai. P. galioides is an herbaceous plant which 
grows at an altitude of 3500-2500 m in the Andean moun- 
tains. To our knowledge, this plant is not used in tradition- 
al medicine. In a previous study, we have isolated and iden- 
tified by fractionation and purification monitored by bioas- 
says, three prenylated-diphenols compounds, grifolic acid, 
grifolin and piperogalin (Mahiou et al., 1995). The present 
paper describes the in vitro and in vivo antileishmanicidal 
effects of these compounds as well as the activity of the in- 
itial crude extracts of P. galioides. 
Materials and Methods 
Chemicals 
The prenylated-diphenols, grifolin, piperogalin and gri- 
folic acid were isolated from Peperomia galioides H. B. K. 
The plant was collected in Unduavi (Bolivia) in April 1986 
by A. Fournet and identified by D. H. Valdebenito (Ohio 
State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA). Voucher speci- 
mens are deposited (AF 615) in the National Herbarium of 
Bolivia (La Paz). The isolation was performed by fractiona- 
tion and purification monitored by bioassays as previously 
described (Mahiou et al., 1995). Physical and spectral data 
(proton and 13carbon nuclear magnetic resonance and mass 
spectrometry) were used to control the purity of terpenoids. 
The structures of terpenoids are shown in Fig. 1. N-Methyl-

Bio logica1 assays 
Cultitre and maintenance of the proinastigote forms of 
Leishmania ssp. The maintenance, cultivation, and isola- 
tion of promastigote-stage parasites have been described in 
detail elsewhere (Fournet et. al., 1994). The ICsos, which 
represent the drug concentration required to inhibit para- 
site growth by 90%, were evaluated from the plot of log 
dose versus parasite growth expressed as a percentage of 
the value for the control ans are the means of at  least two 
independent experiments performed in triplicate with dif- 
ferent stock drug solutions. 
Experimental animals. Female and male BALB/c mice 
were supplied by the IFFA-CREDO, France, and bred at the 
Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud (IICS), 
Asuncion, Paraguay. Golden hamsters (Mesocritus aztratus) 
were used to maintain the parasites. 
Infection 
L. amazonensis MHOM/IFLA/BR/67/PH8 was used and 
maintained by passage every 6 to 8 weeks in hamsters. 
BALB/c (n  = 8) were inoculated in the right hind footpad 
with 2x106 amastigotes obtained from donor hamsters. 
The parasites were delivered in 100 p1 of phosphate buf- 
fered saline (PBS). Lesion development was monitored by 
serial measurements of footpad thickness with a dial gauge 
caliper (OSI, France). Size was expressed as the difference 
in thickness between the infected footpad and contralateral 
uninfected footpad. Measurements commenced one day 
prior to the inoculation of amastigotes and were continued 
between 8 to 12 weeks. 
Drug treatment 
The treatments were initiated four weeks after inocula- 
tion when infection was well established and lesions were 
obvious. Two days before administration of treatments 
the mice were randomly divided into groups of six. N- 
Methylglucamine antimonate was dissolved in 50 p1 of 
PBS and administered to BALB/c mice in regimen of 
100 mg per kg of body weight daily for 15 days by subcu- 
taneous route. The terpenoids and petroleum ether or 
CH2C12 extracts of P. galioides were tested at dose level of 
25 mg/kg and were dissolved in 40 p1 PBS, 5 pl of poly- 
sorbate (Tween 80, OSI, France) and 5 pl of dimethylsul- 
foxide (DMSO). Drugs were administered orally once dai- 
ly for 15 days or by subcutaneous route for 10 days. The 
untreated group received daily 40 p1 of PBS, 5 pl of 
Tween 80 and 5 pl of DMSO. 
Effect of treatment 
The animals were sacrified ten days after cessation of 
treatment to assess parasitological loads in the infected 
footpad. Briefly, the mice were killed and the lesions of in- 
fected footpad were excised, weighed and homogenized 
with a tissue glass grinder Potter in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 me- 
dium (Gibco, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf 
serum, 1 ml of glutamine (GIBCO, France) at 29,4 mg/l, 
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 pg/ml). Plates 
were examined and the number of amastigotes per host le- 
sion cell nucleus were counted. The number of amastigotes 
per lesion per nucleus x lesion weight in gram (lo') is ap- 
proximately equal to the total number of amastigotes per 
organ (Buffet et al., 1995; Stauber et. al., 1958). Parasite 
suppression was calculated from the ratio of the mean le- 
sion amastigote counts of drug-treated mice and the mean 
lesion amastigote counts of untreated mice multiplied by 
100 to obtain the percentage of parasite suppression. 
Statistical analysis. Data given means f standard devia- 
tions, unless indicated otherwise. Comparison of parasite 
suppression in the infected footpad of the untreated control 
group and drug-treated group was analyzed by two-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and by Student's t test. Data 
were considered statistically significant at P<0.05. Analyses 
were performed on a personal computer with Excel 5.0a. 
Results and discussion 
In vitro studies 
The antileishmanial activity of P. galioides and three pre- 
nylated diphenols, grifolin, piperogalin and grifolic acid is 
presented in Table 1, and also for comparison, results ob- 
tained with two leishmanicidal reference drugs, meglumine 
antimonate and pentamidine. The crude extracts of P. gali- 
oides showed activity against three strains of Leishmania at 
100 pg/ml. The fractionation and purification, monitored 
by bioassays, led to isolation of three compounds, identi-

The results obtained with Glucantime@, P. galioides ex- 
tracts, grifolin, grifolic acid and piperogalin treatments on 
the development of L. amazonensis lesions in BALBIc are 
presented in Tab. 2. The subcutaneous treatment with anti- 
monial agent at 100 mg/kg for fifteen days reduced signifi- 
cally the lesion weight by 78.89% (Pi0.001) and the para- 
site loads in infected footpads by 87.61% (PcO.001) versus 
the untreated mice. Effect of treatments with P. galioides 
petroleum ether extract or with the active compound isolat- 
ed by fractionation monitored by bioassays, grifolic acid, 
during the course of infection of BALBIc mice infected with 
L. amazonensis is presented in Fig. 2. No significant differ- 
ence was observed between the untreated BALBIc mice and 
treated mice with these compounds. In contrast, we have 
observed in grifolic acid treated mice a significant increas- 
ing of the weight lesions by 131.47% (subcutaneous via) 
and 182.51% (oral route) and the parasite loads by

reduce the progression of the L. amazonensis infection in 
the infected footpads. In contrast, it  seemed that they fa- 
voured a significant growth of parasites. 
The petroleum ether and methylene chloride extracts of 
P. galioides and the active prenylated-diphenols obviously 
exhibited an in vitro leishmanicidal properties. The confir- 
mation of the in vivo activity of these compounds on the 
course of infection BALBIc mice with L. amazonensis did 
not give the expected results. 
In conclusion, the data presented in this study indicate 
that a direct comparison between the efficacy of extracts or  
compounds against various strains of Leishmania is not al- 
ways evident (Croft, 1994; Hudson, 1994). It is not easy to 
specify wether the in vitro drug activity will correlate with 
its in vivo activity or not (Bell e t  all., 1990; Fournet et al., 
1993; Hocquemiller e t  al., 1991; Iwu e t  al., 1994). The in 
vitro activities of extracts and prenylated-diphenols on  ex- 
tracellular forms of Leishmania suggest that  its activity is 
coupled with cytotoxicity.
