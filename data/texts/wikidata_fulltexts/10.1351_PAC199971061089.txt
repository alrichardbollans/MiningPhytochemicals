dereplication of natural product extracts*

Abstract: Dereplication is an integral part of the early stages of the drug discovery process,
where there is a focus on the rapid identi®cation of novel, biologically active metabolites from
natural sources. We describe a strategy and a system for dereplication and offer several
examples of its successful appplication.
INTRODUCTION
The development of high-throughput screening procedures for the discovery of biologically active
compounds has resulted in a need to prioritize those samples which are deemed `active'. When these
samples are derived from natural product sources (plants, marine organisms or microbes), it is estimated
that it takes $50 000 and 3 months of work to isolate and characterize such an active compound [1]. If the
isolate is a well-known, active compound, there will be a distinct sense of `wasted' effort [2].
To overcome these issues one can limit the number of active extracts entering the fractionation process
through a secondary (in vivo or in vitro) biological screen, which may serve to characterize the activity
from a mechanistic or other relevant perspective. Alternatively, one may look chemically at the extract or
use chromatographic comparison methods to focus on trying to identify classes of compounds of interest
or to be avoided. Under optimum conditions such studies might even be able to indicate whether a
biological response is associated with a particular class of compound (bioautography). These
dereplication processes do not permit critical decision making based on a probability that the active
isolate will be new. For example, they may be focussed on biology and provide only a chemical
class inference [3], or they may provide chemical information which cannot be linked to biological
activity [4].
We describe here a system which is capable of integrating the physical and the chemical data with
biological activity data on well-de®ned subfractions of an active extract. After injection and crude
separation of the extract using a standard gradient elution pro®le, the absorbance characteristics are
obtained with a photodiode array detector. The eluent is split unequally, with the bulk going to 96-well
plates while the remainder enters the electrospray mass spectrometer after priming for positive or
negative ion analysis. This mass information is then correlated with the biological information obtained
on the concurrently collected fractions. In this way, spectral and biological information on the active
principle(s) are directly linked in a time frame to speci®c wells. With this information in hand, there is the
need to relate the genus and species under investigation to prior chemical and biological work, and to
correlate this with information on those metabolites, from whatever source, which have previously
displayed activity. The goal therefore is a system which can afford a direct indication of whether a
particular biologically active extract has a high or a low probability that the active principle is a new or a
known metabolite [5].

EXPERIMENTAL
Dereplication methodology
HPLC-electrospray/MS
The HPLC-electrospray/MS system for the dereplication consisted of a Hewlett Packard (Wilmington, DE,
USA) 5989B mass spectrometer, a 59987A electrospray interface, a Hitachi HPLC system (Hitachi, Japan)
with a L-7400 UV detector, a LC Packering 1:50 splitter, and a Gilson F-204 fraction collector (Middleton,
WI, USA). The quadrupole temperature of the mass spectrometer was set to 120 8C and the spectra were
acquired in the negative or positive ion mode. The temperature of the drying N2 gas was 350 8C and the ¯ow
rate of nebulizing N2 was 40 mL/min and was maintained at 80 psi for the N2 stream in the ion chamber.
Chromatographic parameters
The HPLC separation was performed with a Kromasil C-18 reverse phase column (250 ´ 3.2 mm i.d.)
with 5 mm packing material (Technikron, Wilmette, IL, USA). The mobile phase system consisted of
water (A) and acetonitrile (B) and the gradient was set up as: 0±1 min 95% A, a linear gradient from 1 to
8 min to 50% A/50% B, a linear gradient from 8 to 20 min to 100% B, and then held at this concentration for
a ®nal 10 min before returning to starting conditions. The UV detector was set to 280 nm or 254 nm. The
eluent was split 1:50 after the UV detector, and the smaller stream was mixed with postcolumn solvent
(methanol:water:triethylamine; 90:9.8:0.2) prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer. The larger
stream was recovered in 96-well bioassay plates on a Gilson F-204 series fraction collector (Middleton, WI,
USA) and then tested for cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cell lines (Fig. 1).
Evaluation of cytotoxic activity
Extracts or compounds isolated from active plants were tested according to standard procedures [6]
against the BC1 (human breast cancer), Lu1 (human lung cancer), Col2 (human colon cancer), LNCaP
(human prostate cancer), KB (human oral epidermoid carcinoma), KB-V1 (KB in the presence and
absence of vinblastine (1 mg/mL), and ASK (rat glioma cancer) cell systems.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The dereplication process is based on a comparative analysis of datasets already developed with libraries
of chemotaxonomic, pharmacological, and molecular weight information, such as NAPRALERT or the
Dictionary of Natural Products [5]. After the bioassay is completed, masses associated with the
biologically active time range(s) are determined from either positive or negative total ion chromatogram
(TIC). The time pro®le of the masses in the area of activity is retrieved from the TIC pro®les as extracted
ion chromatograms (EIC). The examples illustrate aspects of this dereplication method.

Semecarpus anacardium
Extracts of the fruits of S. anacardium L. (Anacardiaceae), collected in India, were evaluated in the
human cancer cell panel. A subfraction (SAPE-3) of the petroleum-ether extract of S. anacardium was
active in the KB and Col2 cell lines with IC50 values 2.5 and 5.4 mg/mL, respectively, and was applied to
dereplication. Figure 2 displays the negative total ion chromatogram (A), the HPLC chromatogram at UV
280 nm (B), the extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 315 and 317 (C), and the cytotoxicity pro®le (D)
using the KB cancer cell system of SAPE-3. There is one area of strong activity and another area with
weaker activity in the cytotoxic pro®le. On the basis of the LC/MS chromatogram, the active components
appear at retention times of 15.2 and 19.3 min. The former active compound had a pseudomolecular ion at
316 amu, while the second one displays an ion at 318 amu. These compounds also showed strong
absorbance in the HPLC chromatogram at UV 280 nm. The data obtained were correlated from a mass
and genus perspective with information in the NAPRALERT database and in the Dictionary of Natural
Products. Through comparison with these datasets (uv, ms, molecular formula), the active principles
were considered to be 1,2-dihydroxy-3-pentadeca-70,100-dienylbenzene (1) and 1,2-dihydroxy-3-
pentadec-80-enylbenzene (2), respectively (Fig. 3) [7,8]. These two compounds were also isolated
directly from the active extract using semiprep HPLC since the chromatographic properties of the active
principles were well-de®ned. Spectroscopic analysis indicated them to possess the structures indicated
above. The two pure isolates were evaluated against the human cancer cell lines and showed signi®cant
cytotoxic activities (Table 1).
Begonia parvi¯ora
The roots of B. parvi¯ora L. (Begoniaceae) were collected in Ecuador and also showed strong
cytotoxicity against various human cancer cell lines. In the activity pro®le of the chloroform extract of

B. parvi¯ora, two distinct areas of biological activity were observed, and the retention times of each area
were 9.8 min and 12.5 min, respectively. The ions found in the negative extracted ion chromatogramn
were at m/z 401, 515, 557 and 559 (Fig. 4), which means that the molecular weights of the active
compounds would correspond to 402, 516, 558 and 560. These molecular masses were also used to
compare with the molecular weight information from the NAPRALERT database.
All of these molecular weights were matched for this Begonia sp. in the NAPRALERT system, namely,
cucurbitacin D (m.w. 516), hexanorcucurbitacin D (m.w. 402), cucurbitacin B (m.w. 558) and
dihydrocucurbitacin B (m.w. 560), respectively (Fig. 5), and these compounds were previously
reported to possess cytotoxic activity [9,10]. After co-injection of authentic samples into the HPLC/MS
dereplication system, these compounds were identi®ed as the active principles of B. parvi¯ora.
Acnistus arborescens
Acnistus arborescens L. (Solanaceae) was collected in Brazil and also evaluated against the human cancer
cell lines. The ether extract was active in the KB system with an IC50 value of 0.25 mg/mL. Figure 6 is the
negative TIC (A) and HPLC chromatogram at UV 254 nm (B), the extracted ion chromatogram (C) and
the activity pro®le (D) against KB of the ether extract of A. arborescens. From the activity pro®le,
retention times of areas of strong activity were found to be at 9.3 min, 11.0 min, and 12.4 min, respectively.
The ions found in the negative extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of the active regions were at m/z 469,
527, 569 and 585, which means that their molecular weights would correspond to 470, 528, 570 and 586.
Consequently, these molecular masses were correlated with the information obtained from the NAPRALERT
database.

to be withaferin A; the other masses were not matched in this database. After isolation and structure
elucidation, withanolide 1 (m.w. 528) and withanolide 2 (m.w. 586) (Fig. 7) were obtained and found
to be in the same regions in the activity pro®le. Both compounds showed strong cytotoxic activity against
