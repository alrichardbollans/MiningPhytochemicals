In this study abiodiverse collection of 1,600 NEs, previously analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS2metabolite profiling was screened for Wnt pathway regulation. The results ofthe biological screening drove the selection of a subset of 30 non-toxic NEs withan inhibitory IC50 ≤ 5 μg/mL. To increase the chance of finding structurally novelbioactive NPs, Inventa, a computational tool for automated scoring of NEs basedon structural novelty was used to mine the HRMS2 analysis and dereplicationresults. After this, four out of the 30 bioactive NEs were shortlisted by thisapproach. The most promising sample was the ethyl acetate extract of theleaves of Hymenocardia punctata (Phyllanthaceae). Further phytochemicalinvestigations of this species resulted in the isolation of three knownprenylated flavones (3, 5, 7) and ten novel bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-diones(1, 2, 4, 6, 8–13), named Hymenotamayonins. Assessment of the Wnt inhibitoryactivity of these compounds revealed that two prenylated flavones and threenovel bicyclic compounds showed interesting activity without apparentcytotoxicity. This study highlights the potential of combining Inventa’sstructural novelty scores with biological screening results to effectivelydiscover novel bioactive NPs in large NE collections.KEYWORDSnatural products, Wnt-pathway, Wnt-pathwaymodulators, structural novelty discovery,‘Inventa’ scoring,Hymenocardia punctata, metabolomics (LC-MS), structural elucidationOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYYu Tang,Zhejiang University, ChinaREVIEWED BYBoshi Fu,New York Genome Center, United StatesKaran Arora,Vanderbilt University, United States*CORRESPONDENCEJean-Luc Wolfender,jean-luc.wolfender@unige.chRECEIVED 17 January 2024ACCEPTED 14 March 2024PUBLISHED 04 April 2024CITATIONQuiros-Guerrero L-M, Marcourt L,Chaiwangrach N, Koval A, Ferreira Queiroz E,David B, Grondin A, Katanaev VL andWolfender J-L (2024), Integration of Wnt-inhibitory activity and structural novelty scoringresults to uncover novel bioactive naturalproducts: new Bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-diones from the leaves ofHymenocardia punctata.Front.

Plants serve as important reservoirs of bioactive naturalproducts (NPs) that have been utilized for medicinal purposesfor centuries. NPs often exhibit complex chemical structures dueto evolutionary processes that enable them to interact with biologicaltargets in precise ways (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; Atanasov et al.,2021). These characteristics are challenging to replicatesynthetically, making NPs exceptionally suitable as starting pointsfor drug development (Clark, 1996; Dias et al., 2012; Allard et al.,2023). Natural extracts (NEs) from plant origin possess a vastchemical diversity of NPs, positioning them as highly promisingassets for the exploration and advancement of novel therapeuticagents. Although to date, only about c.a. 20% of plant species havebeen investigated, finding novel or rare structural scaffolds isbecoming increasingly difficult. This challenge arises becausespecies that are taxonomically related tend to biosynthesizesimilar constituents (David et al., 2015).The most common approaches used for the selection of NEsprior to in-depth phytochemical studies include high-throughputbioactivity screening, traditional use of given medicinal plants, andliterature reports (Hostettmann and Terreaux, 2000; Sarker et al.,2005; Sarker and Nahar, 2012). The identification of the activeprinciples is classically performed by bio guided isolation. Thisstrategy is resource-intensive and time-consuming due to the needfor multiple rounds of fractionation and bioassays. There is also arisk of bioactivity lost during the isolation process while otherconcerns include false positives, selectivity issues in bioassays, andmissing synergistic effects (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005;Hamburger, 2019; Najmi et al., 2022). To overcome certainlimitations and anticipate the chances to find bioactive NPs ofinterest, strategies like structural dereplication and extensivemetabolites annotations through metabolomics are increasinglybeing integrated early in research workflows (Olivon et al., 2017;Caesar et al., 2021).Early structural identifications of NPs in NEs can assistresearchers in avoiding reported active NPs or efficientlysearching for analogs of previously reported bioactive NPs(Hubert et al., 2017; Selegato et al., 2023). With the advancementof computational annotations methods throughput inmetabolomics, it is now possible to evaluate the chemical spaceof large NEs collections (Gaudry et al., 2023). This information canbe used to prioritize samples in the search for structurally novel NPs(Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022).To automatedly mine the large amount of metabolite profilingdata and make use of prior pharmacognosy knowledge we recentlyintroduced Inventa (Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022), a metabolomicsbioinformatic workflow designed to streamline the NEs selectionprocess. Its primary objective is to pinpoint NEs with a heightenedprobability of containing structurally novel NPs within NEscollections, that have undergone untargeted UHPLC-HRMS2metabolite profiling. Inventa follows a structured process andtakes as input the results from the MZmine data processing(Schmid et al., 2023), the subsequent MS2 spectral dataorganization using Featured-Based Molecular Networking(FBMN) (Nothias et al., 2020), and the MS2 spectra annotationfrom advanced computational methods like TIMA (Allard et al.,2016; Rutz et al., 2019), and SIRUS (Dührkop et al., 2019). Theannotation results of the features [a peak with anm/z value at a givenretention time (RT)] detected in the samples include molecularformulas, chemical classes based on NPClassifier (Dührkop et al.,2021; Kim et al., 2021), and structural candidates (Dührkop et al.,2015; Cabral et al., 2016). It integrates previous literature reports forthe considered taxon by conducting automated searches in theLOTUS initiative (Rutz et al., 2022), where NP structureoccurrences are catalogued in their respective source organisms.Additionally, it exploits the MEMO (Gaudry et al., 2022) spectralfingerprints to evaluate the spectral diversity exhibited by aparticular sample within a set of NEs. Based on all these data,Inventa calculates four individual component scores: the proportionof annotated features in each NE, the specificity of these featureswithin a NEs data set, the number of reported structures in the NEtaxon and the spectral divergence of the individual NE within thedata set. It provides a combined score (Priority Score, PS) thatenables the prioritization of NEs based on their potential forcontaining structurally novel NPs. In this study we intend toevaluate how Inventa can be combined with bioactivity screeningresults to highlight structurally novel bioactive NPs capable ofregulating the Wnt signaling pathway.The Wnt signaling pathway (Q155769) is critical in severalbiological processes like embryonic development, tissuehomeostasis, and cellular proliferation (Blagodatski et al., 2020;Boudou et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022). However, whendysregulated, it has been associated with several disorders,including cancer (Shaw et al., 2019b; Lim et al., 2021; Jiang et al.,2022), Alzheimer’s (Inestrosa et al., 2012), and osteoporosis(Houschyar et al., 2018; Lojk and Marc, 2021). Many of thecurrent cancer treatments affect rapidly dividing cells resulting innotable side effects since these cells are essential for tissuemaintenance in adults. A more targeted and specific approach,with fewer side effects, may be possible by focusing on targetingtheWnt signaling pathway exclusively in the cancer cells (Shaw et al., 2019b). Several NPs from diverse plant species have been reportedto have some activity over the Wnt-signaling pathway throughdisruption of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade (Pooja andKarunagaran, 2014; Gu et al., 2019). Thus, the discovery of NPscapable of inhibiting or regulating the Wnt-signaling pathway hasbecome a topic of significant interest in drug discovery programs(Fuentes et al., 2015; Nusse and Clevers, 2017).The collection of NEs used for the Wnt-pathway regulationscreening consists in a subset of 1,600 NEs from the Pierre FabreLaboratories (PFL) Library that were previously analyzed by massiveUHPLC-HRMS2 metabolite profiling, and different annotationsworkflows were applied. The set data was publicly disclosedallowing researchers to explore a wide range of chemicalcompositions across different plant species (Allard et al., 2023).The NEs were generated directly from the plant material bymaceration with ethyl acetate, followed by SiO2-SPE filtration.This method was optimized for the recovery of middle polaritycompounds, which is crucial for the objectives of the HTS programconducted by PFL. The samples were prepared in DMSO at aconcentration of 5 mg/mL (Allard et al., 2023). This set of1,600 NEs has been exploited for the development ofbioinformatics tools (Gaudry et al., 2022; Gaudry et al., 2023).Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org02Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982In the search for structurally novel bioactive NPs from plants, wesought to investigate the UHPLC-HRMS2 metabolite profiling andWnt-pathway regulation screening results for this set of 1,600 NEs.Then, to increase the chances of selecting active NEs containingnovel NPs, Inventa was used to calculate priority scores forstructural novelty. The combination of both information, thescreening results, and Inventa’s scores highlighted severalbioactive NEs with a high potential of containingstructurally novel NPs.Results and discussionSelection of promising NEs by combiningbioactivity results and structuralnovelty scoresThe same samples used for the UHPLC-HRMS2 metaboliteprofiling previously described by Allard et al. (2023) werescreened for the presence of compounds with a potential Wnt-regulatory activity. The screening experimental design used the BT-20 triple-negative breast cancer cell line (TNBC), stably transfectedwith the TopFlash reporter construct, and sensitive to purifiedWnt3a stimulation (Koval et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2019a). TheNEs were screened in single repeats at five different concentrations(50, 25, 12.5, 6, and 3 μg/mL) and cytotoxicity was monitored at thesame time. Given that the assay does not include positive controlcompounds, an NEs or compound is considered ‘toxic’ if its IC50value against Renilla luciferase is less than 1.7 times the estimatedTopFlash value. This indicates that any reduction observed in theTopFlash response is likely influenced by a significant toxic effect(Shaw et al., 2019a).The results of theWnt-regulatory bioactivity testing showed thatout of the 1,600 NEs, 497 exhibited either Wnt-regulatory orcytotoxic activity. Among these active samples, 389 active NEswere classified into 148 NEs Wnt potentiators (79 NEs werenon-toxic and 69 NEs had a toxicity IC50 > 50 μg/mL), and241 NEs Wnt inhibitors (all non-toxic). The remaining 108 NEswere solely cytotoxic, with an IC50 value ranging between 0.30 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL.Out of these 241 inhibitory NEs, 132 NEs showed a Wnt-inhibition IC50 < 50 μg/mL, with 53 NEs having a Wnt-inhibition IC50 < 10 μg/mL. Focusing on samples capable ofinhibiting the Wnt pathway is essential for discovering NPs totreat diseases linked to the dysregulation of this pathway.Therefore, in this study, only inhibitory NEs were furtherconsidered.The 241 NEs with Wnt inhibitory activities mentioned abovecomprised a total of 58 different botanical families, 97 differentgenera, and 105 unique species. Fabaceae (Q44448) is the mostrepresented family with 14 samples, followed by Rubiaceae(Q156569) and Euphorbiaceae (Q156584) with nine and eightsamples respectively. The most represented genus is Pandanus(Q471914, Pandanaceae Q736182) with five samples, followed bySambucus (Q131448, Adoxaceae Q156677) with four samples, andElegia (Q3007993, Restionaceae Q131501), Baliospermum(Q4850999, Euphorbiaceae Q156584), and Dolichos (Q526727,Fabaceae), each with three samples.To further reduce the list only NEs with an inhibition IC50 below5 μg/mL were considered. This reduced the 241 to 30 NEscomprising 25 different species from 17 different botanicalfamilies, with Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae being the mostprominent, each contributing 5 NEs. Within this reduced set,there were 23 different genera, with the majority represented byonly 1 NE, except for Elegia with three samples, and Pandanus,Euphorbia (Q146567), Ehretia (Q276756), and Baliospermum withtwo samples each.The biological screening results drove the first selection step,resulting in a subset of 30 non-toxic NEs with an inhibitory IC50 ≤5 μg/mL (see Figure 1A). To further refine the selection, additionalselection criteria based on UHPLC-HRMS2metabolite profiling datawere used. Specifically, Inventa scores, which evaluates themetabolites potential structural novelty within NEs (Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022). These scores were calculated for the entire1,600 NEs set using the positive ionization (PI) mode UHPLC-HRMS2 (Allard et al., 2023) (Figures 1.B,C). They were therefore notlimited to the 30 active extracts alone, and thus better demonstratedtheir potential for holding new structures, since the reference sampleset was much broader than that restricted by the biologicalactivity filter.The rough ranking based on PS significantly reduces thenumber of samples to consider which is important in largedatasets. However, within the list of top-ranked samples, it isimportant to evaluate each parameter individually and, whenpossible, refine the literature search. This provides a betteroverview of the available data. The PS score enables to rapidlyestimate the likeliness of a sample to contain potentiallystructurally novel NPs. This should not be interpreted as anabsolute ranking. In this study, the focus shifted from the entirecollection of 1,600 NEs to a much smaller subset of 30 active NEs.Instead of selecting these NEs based on their overall PS assignedby Inventa, a more meticulous approach was adopted. EachInventa’s component for these NEs was individually assessedfor a more precise selection.The importance of the different novelty score components in theselection of NEs lies in its multifaceted approach to evaluating thestructural richness and dissimilarities among samples. Inventaoperates at two levels: first, by assessing individual featureswithin each extract to gauge their specificity and annotationstatus, and second, by comparing the overall spectral space ofeach extract to measure dissimilarities in a sample set andpotentially highlight NEs holding a pool of spectra correlated toa very specific metabolome. Subsequently, it integrates data fromliterature reports for the taxon, highlighting NEs potentiallycontaining novel NPs (Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022). The insightsgained from these scores offer a thorough evaluation of the potentialfor extracts to contain structurally novel NPs. This comprehensiveevaluation framework empowers researchers to pinpoint NEs withuntapped metabolic potential, thereby facilitating the discovery ofnovel NPs with potential therapeutic applications.First, to ensure that only NEs potentially holding specificconstituents (specific pool of MS2 spectra), only those with aSimilarity Component (SC) value of ‘1’ were further considered.This score highlights extracts containing metabolites whose MS2spectra are significantly different from those of all 1,600 extracts inthe data set. The SC employes the MEMO metric (Gaudry et al.,Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org03Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.13719822022) to generate a matrix containing all MS2 information in theform of peaks and neutral losses (Huber et al., 2020; 2021) andautomatic outlier detection machine learning algorithms toemphasize NEs that display substantial spectral dissimilarity(Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022). Out of the 30 NEs only sixremained after this filter.FIGURE 1Overview of the general strategy for the selection of promising NEs for the discovery of structurally novel bioactive NPs in collections of NEs. (A)Bioactive-driven selection: The NEs collection is reduced according to the bioactivity screening results. In this study only non-toxic NEs with an Wntinhibitory IC50 ≤ 5 μg/mLwere considered. (B)General overview of the UHPLC-HRMS2 profiling and annotationworkflowused for the characterization ofthe 1,600NEs collection by Allard et al. (2023). (C) TheUHPLC-HRMS2 and annotations results for the entire 1,600NEs collectionwere fed to Inventato calculate the structural novelty scores. (D) Novelty-driven selection: Each component given by Inventa for the reduced set of NEs was individuallyassessed for a more precise selection. SC: Similarity Component; CC: Class Component; rsp: reported compounds in species; rsg: reported compoundsin genus.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982Then, only NEs with a Literature Component (LC) value closeto ‘1’ were selected. The value of LC reflects a rough estimation ofthe extent of the prior phytochemical knowledge for a giventaxon (according to LOTUS). The closer to ‘1’, the fewercompounds have been reported at the species, genus, andfamily levels for a given sample. Inventa calculates the numberof reported compounds for each species, genus, and family, andthis data forms part of the final information provided for eachsample. Based on this information, only NEs reporting less than10 reported compounds in both genus and species levels werefurther considered (Figure 1D).This reduced the 6 NEs to only 4 NEs with few compoundsreported, since the species Derris scandens (Q15488445, Fabaceae)and Iris lactea (Q6747387, Iridaceae Q155941) presented over100 and 400 compounds reported at the genus level respectively(see Wikidata Query results for genus Derris and Iris). Additionally,the remaining 4 NEs presented a Class Component (CC) of ‘1’. A CCvalue of one indicates that there are chemical classes proposed byCANOPUS (Dührkop et al., 2021) not yet reported for both thespecies and the genus (according to LOTUS). This suggests a highprobability of potentially discovering unreported NPs within theseNEs (Quiros-Guerrero et al., 2022).The four highly active NEs remaining were: Hymenocardiapunctata Wall. ex Lindl. (Q15514019, Phyllanthaceae Q133206),Aporosa villosa (Lindl.) Baill. (Q11128570, EuphorbiaceaeQ156584), and 2 NEs of different plant parts of Baliospermumsonalifolium (Burm.) Suresh (Q15386102, Euphorbiaceae).To further refine the selection process, a thoroughcomplementary literature search was done on this final set ofthree species, considering all the possible botanical synonymsaccording to WFO Plant List. This search revealed no directreports for the Brosimum solanifolium species. However, for oneof its synonyms, Baliospermum montanum (Q3595677), theliterature reports the presence of alkaloids, daphnanes, ingenanes,and phorbol esters (tiglianes Q27117179) like montanin(Q27107381) and baliospermin (Q27105913) (Seigler, 1994; Maliand Wadekar, 2008) with proven anticancer activity (Ogura et al.,1978). These metabolites were not accessible by LOTUS, so theywere not considered in first instance. Since B. solanifolium, presentsactive reported NPs, both extracts were no further considered. ForA.villosa, some reports already described various bioactivities ofethanolic extracts from different plant parts were reported(Srikrishna et al., 2008; Venkataraman et al., 2010; Nanna et al.,2021). Additionally, preliminary metabolite profiling indicated ahigh concentration of fatty acids. Therefore, this plant was notinitially considered for further study.In contrast, for Hymenocardia punctata, there were no existingreports on its chemical composition or bioactivity evaluation. Thislack of information aligned with its initial LC score based on theLotus. Consequently, the ethyl acetate extract of H. punctata leavesFIGURE 2(A) Original UHPLC-HRMS2 chromatogram of Hymenocardia punctata leaves ethyl acetate extract from the 1,600 NEs collection. (B) Inventa’s ionmap for the Original UHPLC-HRMS2 chromatogram of Hymenocardia punctata leaves ethyl acetate extract. Each dot represents one feature, the size isproportional to the intensity. The color shows the annotation status, green: unannotated, yellow: annotated (see interactive plot here).Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org05Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982was identified as the most promising candidate for the discovery ofnovel NPs. This plant is a flowering shrub from the Phyllanthaceaefamily, found in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the MalayPeninsula, and Sumatra (van Welzen, 2016).Dereplication results overview for the ethylacetate extract of Hymenocardiapunctata leavesAccording to Inventa’s results, the annotation rate for the H.punctata extract was notably high (c.a. 75%). To further explore theregions of the chromatogram that were annotated, the comparisonbetween the original (PI) UHPLC-HRMS2 chromatogram (from the1,600 NEs collection metabolite profiling) and the Ionmap generatedby Inventa was carefully inspected (Figure 2). Upon examination ofthe SIRIUS and ISDB annotation results, as well as the outcomes ofIon Identity FBMN (II-FBMN, see Supplementary Figure S1, PDFversion here) (Nothias et al., 2020; Schmid et al., 2021), it emergedclearly that the most intense features (Figure 2A), were notannotated (green dots on the Ionmap in Figure 2B).For the following phytochemical studies, the leaves of H.punctata were subsequently extracted on a larger scale withhexane, ethyl acetate (HPE) and methanol. The HPE and HPMextracts underwent UHPLC-HRMS2 metabolite profiling.Additionally, a Charge Aerosol Detector (CAD) was used toobtain semiquantitative information (Ligor et al., 2013; Gamache,2017). After careful composition assessment, only HPE was furtherconsidered. As shown in Figure 3A the features of interest werepresent and correlated with the major compounds in the extractaccording to the CAD chromatographic trace (Figure 3B).The (PI) UHPLC-HRMS2 data from HPE was used to generate anew II-FBMN which confirmed most information obtained in theoriginal extract from the 1,600 NEs collection. The most intensepeaks were clustered together indicating their close structuralrelationship (II-FBMN, see Supplementary Figure S2, PDFversion here). The chemical class and structural annotationsobtained through GNPS, SIRIUS and CANOPUS (Dührkopet al., 2019; 2021) suggested that most compounds derived fromthe shikimate-phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathways (refer toTreemap overview Supplementary Figure S3 -interactive plotvisualization here-, and Supplementary Table S1).Both the CAD and MS traces confirmed that the majorconstituents of HPE were not annotated. This, together with thenovelty scores given by Inventa, confirmed that HPE is a promisingextract for the search for new bioactive NPs.HPLC-based bioactivity profiling of the ethylacetate extract of Hymenocardiapunctata leavesAn HPLC-based bioactivity profiling (Hamburger, 2019) wascarried out to establish a relationship between the majorunannotated chromatographic peaks (potentially new NPs) andthe observed bioactivity of HPE. A small amount of HPE (c.a.10 mg) was fractionated by semi-preparative HPLC-UV underoptimized chromatographic conditions. Column’s effluent wascollected into a 96 deep-well plate and the Wnt-regulatorybioactivity of each dried micro-fraction was assessed. The HPLCbased bioactivity profile confirmed that the bioactivity was mainlyrelated to the major unannotated peaks (SeeSupplementary Figure S4).Isolation and de novo structuralcharacterization of compounds from theHymenocardia punctata leaves ethylacetate extractAccording to the dereplication results and the HPLC-basedbioactivity profiling, the isolation efforts should be focused onthe peaks with retention times between 3.5 and 6 min (seeFigure 3). An in-depth phytochemical study of the HPE extractwas carried out to corroborate the presence of structurally novel NPsand evaluate their Wnt regulatory activity. The chromatographicconditions used for the HPLC based bioactivity profiling wereadapted to the flash chromatography scale using a geometricalgradient transfer (Guillarme et al., 2008). Several of the fractionsobtained contained mixtures of compounds that were furtherseparated by high resolution semi-preparative HPLC using dry-load injection (Queiroz et al., 2019).This approach allowed the successful isolation of thirteencompounds (1–13, see Figure 4). The structures of all thecompounds were determined based on the NMR and HRMSanalyses. Three of these compounds were identified as 3′,8-diprenylapigenin 3) previously isolated from Morus alba(Q157307) (Dat et al., 2010), 6,8-diprenylapigenin 5) previouslyisolated from Glycyrrhiza inflata (Q5572787) (Lin et al., 2017), and3′,6-diprenylapigenin 7) previously isolated from Glycyrrhizauralensis (Q1196166) (Fukai et al., 1991). These compounds (3,5, 7) were annotated as prenylated isoflavones by GNPS and Sirius.The other ten molecules corresponded to new compounds and werenamed Hymenotamayonins A-J (1, 2, 4, 6, 8–13), their full de novostructure identification is detailed below.The relative retention time in the PI HRMS2 chromatogram isdepicted in Figure 3 (numbers in parenthesis). The 13 compoundswere recovered in sufficient amounts to allow full structuralcharacterization and assessment of biological activity from only55 g of dried plant material.Compound 1 was isolated as an amorphous pale yellow powderwith an [M + H]+ of m/z 509.2894 corresponding to a molecularformula (MF) of C31H41O6 (error −0.65 ppm) (see Table 1). Itcorresponded to the peak at 4.4 min in Figure 3. The NMR datashowed signals related to a 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenylgroup; with two meta aromatic protons coupled to each other (J =2.3 Hz) at δH 6.38 (CH-2′) and δH 6.47 (CH-6′), a methoxy singlet atδH 3.75 (4′-OCH3), a methylene at δH 3.28 (2H, m, CH2-1″), avinylic proton at δH 5.24 (1H, thept, J = 6.7, 1.3 Hz, CH-2″) and twomethyl groups at δH 1.73 (3H, d, J = 1.3 Hz, CH3-4″) and δH 1.77(3H, d, J = 1.3 Hz, CH3-5″). This part of the molecule was confirmedbased on the HMBC correlations from CH-2′ to C-1’’ (δC 29.1), C-4’(δC 146.0), and C-6’ (δC 115.8), from H-6′ to C-2’ (δC 121.6), C-4′and C-5’ (δC 151.0), from CH3-4″ and CH3-5″ to C-3’’ (δC 133.6)and C-2’’ (δC 123.9), from CH2-1″ to C-2′, C-3’ (δC 136.3), C-4′, C-2″ and C-3″, and from 4′-OCH3 to C-4’ (see Figure 5). A secondFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org06Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982prenyl group was identified based on the signals at δH 2.05 and δH2.17 for the methylene CH2-11, δH 4.76 for the ethylenic proton CH-12, and δH 1.48 and δH 1.50 for the two methyl groups CH3-14 andCH3-15. The COSY correlation from the methylene CH2-16 (δH1.91 and δH 2.82) to the oxymethine CH-17 (δH 4.72) and theHMBC correlations from the methyl groups CH3-19 and CH3-20(δH 1.21 and δH 1.34) to C-18 (δC 71.1) and CH-17 (δC 92.8) allowedthe identification of a 3-methylbutyl chain with positions two andthree oxygenated. The aromatic moiety from the 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl group was shown to be linked to amethine, which is connected to two consecutive methylenes. Thiswas evidence thanks to the HMBC correlations from the methineCH-2 (δH 3.12) to C-1’ (δC 137.9), C-2′, C-6′, the methylenes CH2-3(δC 27.5) and CH2-4 (δC 33.1), as well as the one from CH-3eq (δH1.64) to C-1’ (see Figure 5). A vinylic singlet at δH 5.80 (CH-6), twoquaternary carbons (δC 61.7 (C-10) and 67.2 (C-8)), and threecarbonyl carbons (δC 181.2 (C-5), 201.3 (C-7), and 207.7 (C-9))fitted the number of carbons (31) with the molecular formula. TheHMBC correlations from CH2-11 to CH-2, C-7, C-8, and C-9, fromCH2-16 to CH2-4, C-5, C-9, and C-10, from CH-6 to C-5, C-8, andC-10, from CH-2 to C-7, and C-9, and from CH2-4 to C-5 allowed toposition the 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl group, theprenyl, and the 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl group on a bicyclic[3.3.1] core as shown in Figure 4. The carbons C-8 and C-10 arebridged by a ketone (C-9) with a typical chemical shift (δC 207.7).These carbons together with CH-2, CH2-3, and CH2-4 integrate thefirst 6-member ring. The second ring shares the carbons C-8, C-9,and C-10 with a keto-enol system between carbons C-5, C-6, and C-7. According to the molecular formula, an additional ring must beestablished either between the tertiary alcohol in C-18 and C-5 toform a tetrahydropyran ring, or between the secondary alcohol in C-17 and C-5 to form a tetrahydrofuran ring. The lack of HMBCcorrelation between CH-17 and C-5 could not answer this question.Measurements in CDCl3 were done to try to find correlationsbetween these protons by avoiding solvent exchanges, but theydid not show any correlations either. However, the CH-17 andC-18 chemical shift values (δC 92.8 and δC 71.1, respectively)compared to values in the literature for oblongifolin R (whichpresents a tetrahydrofuran ring with CH at δC 94.8 and C at δC71.1) and oblongifolin S (bearing a tetrahydropyran ring with CH atδC 69.6 and C at δC 86.9) (Zhang et al., 2014) led to the conclusionthat a 5-member ring is present. The two-dimensional structure ofcompound 1 was established as shown in Figure 4. The relativeconfiguration was established through the ROESY correlationsobserved in CD3OD and CDCl3. The spectra recorded in CDCl3helped identify the pseudo equatorial and axial positions of CH2-FIGURE 3(A) PI UHPLC-HRMS2 chromatogram of de novo Hymenocardia punctata leaves ethyl acetate extract (HPE) between 3.5 min and 6 min.

These proton signals overlapped with otherones in CD3OD. The ROESY correlations fromCH-2’/CH-6′ to CH-4ax indicated that the 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl groupwas in a pseudo axial position and the coupling constant value ofCH-2 (J = 5.4 Hz in CD3OD, J = 6.1 Hz in CDCl3) confirmed thatCH-2 was in a pseudo equatorial position (Figure 6A). Thecorrelation between CH-17 and CH-4eq indicated the relativeconfiguration of C-17 (Figure 6A). Consequently, the relativeconfiguration of 1 was proposed as (2S,8R,10R,17R) or(2R,8S,10S,17S). To establish its absolute configuration, the ECDspectrum was calculated based on the relative configurationproposed by NMR and compared to theexperimental data (Figure 6B). Thus, compound 1 was assignedas (2S,8R,10R,17R)-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-12-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-8-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-5-oxotricyclo[6.3.1.05,10]dodec-5-ene-7,9-dione and namedHymenotamayonin G.Compound 2 was isolated as an amorphous pale yellow powderwith an [M +H]+ ofm/z 479.2793 corresponding toMF of C30H39O5(error 0.21 ppm) (see Table 1). It corresponded to the peak at4.5 min in Figure 3.

This prenyl group was positionedin C-10 thanks to the HMBC correlations from CH2-16 to themethylene CH2-4 (δC 34.7), the quaternary carbon C-10 (δC 61.6)and the ketone C-9 (δC 211.9). To fit with the molecular formula, anenolized 1,3-diketone was placed in C-5, C-6, and C-7. Due to therapid tautomeric equilibrium and H/D exchange with the solvent,the 1H and 13C signals of C-5, CH-6, and C-7 were not observed(Traven et al., 1997; Rajaonarivelo et al., 2016) (See SupplementaryFigure S5). The relative configuration of 2 was the same as describedfor 1, and the absolute configuration was confirmed with thecomparison between the calculated and experimental ECDspectra (See Supplementary Figure S6). Thus compound 2 wasidentified as (2S,8R,10R)-(4,5-dihydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-5-hydroxy-8,10-bis(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-7,9-dione and named Hymenotamayonin A.The molecular weight of compound 4, m/z 509.2894 [M + H]+(calculated for MF C31H41O6, error −0.65 ppm) was the same ascompound 1 and the NMR data were also (see Table 1) very closewith the same functional groups: a 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl, a prenyl group, a 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutylchain, all attached to a bicyclic[3.3.1] core. The differencebetween 1 and 4 was the positions of the prenyl group and the2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl chain in the bicyclic core. In 4, theHMBC correlations from the methylene CH2-16 of the prenyl at δH2.43/2.53 to CH2-4 (δC 27.8), C-10 (δC 64.4), C-5 (δC 200.7), and C-9(δC 208.0), and from the methylene CH2-11 of the 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl chain at δH 1.74/2.53 to CH-2 (δC 49.4), C-8 (δC 64.7),and C-7 (δC 182.1) indicated that the prenyl was in C-10 and the 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl chain was in C-8. As in 1, the chemicalshift of CH-12 (δC 92.2) and C-13 (δC 71.1) showed that atetrahydrofuran ring is present between CH-12 and C-7. Thecoupling constant of CH-2 (d, J = 6.4 Hz) and the ROESY fromthe aromatic protons CH-2′ and CH-6′ to CH-4ax at δH 2.08 (td, J =14.1, 4.8 Hz) indicated that as in 1, that the aromatic group is in apseudo axial configuration. The ROESY correlation from CH-2 tothe methine CH-12 of the tetrahydrofuran group showed that theconfiguration of C-12 and C-2 is S. Comparison of the experimentaland calculated ECD spectra corroborated this observation (SeeSupplementary Figure S6). Compound 4 was identified as(2S,8R,10R,12S)-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-17-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-10-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl-7-oxotricyclo[6.3.1.07,8]dodec-6-ene-5,9-dione and namedHymenotamayonin H. It corresponded to one of the major peak at4.6 min in both, MS and CAD traces (Figure 3).Similar to 1, compound 6 exhibited an MF of C31H40O6 (m/z509.2894 [M +H]+, error −0.65 ppm) (see Table 1). The NMR data of 6were very close to those of 1 and indicated that the connectivity andconfiguration of the bicyclic[3.3.1] core, the pseudo axial position of the3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl group in C-2, the linkage of theprenyl group in C-8 were the same as those described for 1. The maindifferences concerned the 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl chain for whichthe chemical shift values of the oxymethine C-17 were observed at δC69.9 (δC 92.8 for 1) and the quaternary oxygenated carbon C-18 at δC84.8 (δC 71.1 for 1).

The configuration at C-17 was determined thanks to theROESY correlation from CH-16eq at δH 1.74 (dd, J = 14.9, 5.3 Hz) toCH-4ax at δH 2.09 (td, J = 14.5, 4.6 Hz), from CH-16ax at δH 2.94 (dd,J = 14.9, 3.9 Hz) to CH3-20 at δH 1.26 (Figure 6C). The couplingconstant value of CH-17 (t, J = 5.3, 3.9 Hz) and its ROESY correlationswith CH3-19 and CH3-20 indicated its equatorial position. Theconfiguration proposed was confirmed by comparison of theexperimental and calculated ECD spectra (See Supplementary FigureS6). Compound 6 was then identified as (2S,8R,10R,17R)-17-hydroxy-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-18,18-dimethyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-5-oxotricyclo[7.3.1.05,10]dodec-5-ene-7,9-dione and named Hymenotamayonin I. Itcorresponded to one of the peaks at 4.8 min in Figure 3. (Table 2)The HRMS and NMR data (Table 1) showed that compound 8(Hymenotamayonin C) was the O-methyl derivative of 2:(2S,8R,10R)-2-(5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-5-hydroxy-8,10-bis(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-7,9-dione. Thus, the group in C-2 was the same as 1, 4,and 6: a 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl group. Itcorresponded to one of the peaks at 4.9 min in Figure 3.The NMR data of 9 (Table 2) displayed very close similarities tothose of 4, for the same MF as indicated by the HRMS ion at m/z509.2893 [M +H]+. As for the previous comparison between 6 and 1,the difference between 9 and 4 was the presence of atetrahydropyran ring in 9 whereas 4 had a tetrahydrofuran ringin the same place. This was indicated by the chemical shift’s values ofCH-12 (δC 70.5) and C-13 (δC 85.3), in 9 compared to those of 4 (δC92.2 and δC 71.1, respectively). The ROESY from CH-11eq at δH1.59 (dd, J = 14.7, 7.8 Hz) to CH-2 at δH 3.63 (d, J = 6.2 Hz), fromCH-11ax at δH 2.61 (dd, J = 14.7, 3.9 Hz) to CH3-15 at δH1.26 indicated the S configuration at C-12 (See Figure 6D). Thus,compound 9 was identified as (2S,8R,10R,12S)-12-hydroxy-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-13,13-dimethyl-10-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-7-oxotricyclo[7.3.1.07,8]dodec-5-ene-5,9-dione and named Hymenotamayonin J. Its absoluteconfiguration was confirmed based on the comparison of theexperimental and calculated ECD spectra (See SupplementaryFigure S6) (see Table 2).The NMR data of 10 were closely related to those of 2 and theHRMS data confirmed that both molecules had the same MFFIGURE 5Key HMBC correlation for compound 1.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org11Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982C30H39O5 (m/z 479.2791 [M + H]+, error −0.19 ppm). The maindifferences were the chemical shift value of CH-2 and its couplingconstants. Whereas the chemical shift values of CH-2 were observedabove δH 3.00 in the previous compounds it appeared shielded in10 at δH 2.64. In the previous compounds, CH-2 was observed as adoublet with a coupling constant between 5.4 Hz and 6.4 Hz. In 10,CH-2 resonated as a doublet of doublet (J = 13.2, 4.0 Hz) indicatingthat it was, in a pseudo-axial configuration. This was confirmed bythe ROESY correlation from CH-2 to CH-4ax at δH 1.64(overlapped). Thus, compound 10 was identified as (2R,8R,10R)-2-(4,5-dihydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-5-hydroxy-8,10-bis(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-7,9-dione andnamed Hymenotamayonin B. It corresponded to one of the peaksat 4.95 min in Figure 3 (see Table 2).The NMR and HRMS data of 11 indicated that it was the 4′-O-methyl derivative of 10, thus (2R,8R,10R)-2-(5-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-5-hydroxy-8,10-bis(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-7,9-dione (Hymenotamayonin D).

TheNMRdata showed as in 6, that thebicyclic[3.3.1] core presented a 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenylsubstitution in a pseudo axial configuration in C-2 and a prenyl groupinC-8. The oxymethine CH-17 observed in the tetrahydropyran ring of6was replaced by a methylene (δH 2.04 (td, J = 14.3, 4.1 Hz, CH-17ax),δH 1.86 (dt, J = 14.3, 4.1 Hz, CH-17eq) and δC 31.2). The HMBCcorrelations from CH-16ax (δH 2.56, td, J = 14.4, 4.2 Hz) to CH2-4 (δC33.2) and C-10 (δC 51.0), from CH-17eq to C-10, from CH-16eq (δH1.71, dt, J = 14.4, 4.2 Hz), CH3-19 (δH 1.46) and CH3-20 (δH 1.29) toquaternary oxygenated carbon C-18 (δC 82.3) confirmed that 12 wasthe 17-deoxy derivative of 6: (2S,8R,10R)-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-18,18-dimethyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-5-oxotricyclo[7.3.1.05,10]dodec-5-ene-7,9-dione(Hymenotamayonin F). It corresponded to one of the peaks at5.45 min in Figure 3.The MF of 13 was established as C31H38O5 by HRMS (m/z491.2792 [M + H]+, error 0.08 ppm). As compounds 1, 6, 8, 11,and 12, the NMR data of 13 (Table 2) showed signals correspondingto a bicyclic[3.3.1] core with, in C-2, a 3-prenyl-4-methoxy-5-hydroxyphenyl in a pseudo axial configuration and, in C-8, aprenyl group. Similar to 1, a tetrahydrofuran ring was observedbetween C-10 and C-5, as indicated by the signals from themethylene CH2-16 (δH 2.63/δH 2.12) and the oxymethine CH-17(δH 5.32). The HMBC correlations from the methylidene observed atδH 5.17 (q, J = 1.2 Hz, CH-20a) and δH 5.05 (p, J = 1.2 Hz, CH-20b) tothe oxymethine CH-17 (δC 89.2), the vinylic carbon C-18 (δC 143.1)and the methyl CH3-19 (δC 17.3) enabled the identification of thestructure shown in Figure 4. The configuration in C-17 wasdetermined as R thanks to the ROESY correlations from CH-17 toCH-4eq (δH 2.23, brd, J = 9.4 Hz, the relative configuration of theother carbons were established as (2S,8R,10R). Thus, compound 13was identified as (2S,8R,10R,17R)-2-(5-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-8-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-17-(prop-1-en-2-yl-5-oxotricyclo[6.3.1.05,10]dodec-5-ene-7,9-dione and named asHymenotamayonin E. It corresponded to one of the peaks at 5.5 minin Figure 3.Compounds 1,2,4,6, and 8–13 make part of a very restrictedgroup of NPs that contain an uncommon bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-dione core (Lin et al., 2018). To date, only three NPs withthis core have been reported. The first compound ever reported inthis class was acutifolin A (Q15410235), isolated from aMoraceae (Q156579) Brazilian medicinal plant B. acutifolium(Q15471077) (Takashima and Ohsaki, 2001). Later, tazettone Aand tazettone B were isolated from Narcissus tazetta var.chinensis (Q25115128) (Fu et al., 2013), an Amaryllidaceae(Q155848). According to the Angiosperm (Q14832431)phylogeny grouping, N. tazzeta belongs to the Asparagalesorder (Q26229), while Brosimum acutifolium and H. punctataare comprised in the Fabids clade (Q2683213) but in differentorders, Rosales (Q21895) and Malpighiales (Q21887),respectively. There are therefore no closer taxonomicrelationships between these species that could explaincommon biosynthetic pathways (The Angiosperm PhylogenyGroup, 2009).From a biosynthetic point of view, the new compounds isolatedfromH. punctatamay have been formed by rearrangement of an 8-prenylflavane as suggested for acutifolin A, tazettone A, andtazettone B (Figure 7).

Theextraction process was under neutral conditions, which is anindication of the authenticity of the compounds. The proposedbiosynthesis pathway involves the presence of an electrophilicspecies that introduces the hydroxy group at position C-10 inacutifolin A, and tazettone A and B. We hypothesize that, in ourcase, this electrophilic species is a dimethylallyl diphosphate(DMAPP) unit, resulting in the prenylation of the position C-10 (Yazaki et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2021). This assertion is plausiblesince we were able to isolate prenylated flavonoids (3, 5 and 7),which is an indication of their abundance in this plant.Evaluation of the Wnt-regulatory activity ofisolated compoundsThe Wnt-regulatory activity of all isolated compounds from H.punctata was evaluated using two different cancer cell linesrepresenting TNB cancer, known for its reliance on Wntsignaling: BT-20 and HCC1395 cells. Additionally, HumanEmbryonic Kidney HEK293 cells were used to represent non-malignant cells. The results for the active compounds are shownin Table 3 (and Supplementary Figure S7).The results demonstrated that the prenylated flavone 7,exhibited the highest potency against the HEK293 cell line, withan IC50 value of 12 µM. Other compounds exhibited significantlyhigher selectivity against HCC1395 cancer cells. For example, theother prenylated flavone 3 demonstrated the highest selectivity,followed by one of the newly discovered bicyclic compounds 4,with IC50 values of 13 µM and 14 μM, respectively. Notably, theirpotency against both BT-20 and HEK293 cells was nearly two-foldlower. In the case of the BT-20 cell line, seven displayed the highestactivity, followed by 4, with IC50 values of 16 µM and 26 μM,respectively. It is worth noting that, in general, the prenylatedflavones (3 and 7) had lower IC50 values compared to the novelbicyclic compounds (1, 2 and 4) in at least two out of the threedifferent cell models. Additionally, for all compounds, the specificityfor Wnt inhibition was controlled by the absence of effects of thecompounds on co-transfected constitutively expressed Renillaluciferase, serving as a reporter of cytotoxic or other negativeeffects of the compounds on the cell wellbeing (Shaw et al., 2019a).Over the past 2 decades, numerous studies have revealed thatflavonoids and structurally related compounds possess inhibitoryeffects on human diseases by targeting various cellular signalingcomponents (Amado et al., 2011; 2014). Flavonoids have beenrecognized as inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, with many of themshown to inhibit it by downregulating the levels of β-catenin (Fuenteset al., 2015). For instance, Apigenin (Q424567), the first flavonoid to bereported as aWnt inhibitor, has been found to decrease β-catenin levelsand promote cell cycle arrest in breast and colorectal cancer (Song et al., 2000; Landesman-Bollag et al., 2001; Amado et al., 2011). However, todate, there have been no reported findings of whether and howprenylation changes the potency of flavones towards the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A few reports show the direct activity ofprenylated isoflavones, such as 8-prenylgenistein by promotingosteogenesis (Zhang et al., 2018; Qiu et al., 2020). Our resultsclearly demonstrate that prenylated flavones, and similar analogslike the new bicyclic compounds, selectively disrupt the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, however with a potency only modestly improvedfrom that reported for apigenin, from c. a. 30 μM down to 10–20 µM.This is also paralleled by other studies showing that structurally similarprenylated chalcones such as derricin and derricidin isolated fromLonchocarpus sericeus (Q15471182) reduce cell viability and induce cellcycle arrest in colorectal cancer HCT116 cells (Q28334584) throughnegative modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Stevens, 2020).Experimental sectionGeneral experimental proceduresThe plant material was extracted in a Thermo Scientific DionexASE 350 Accelerated Solvent Extractor (Thermo Scientific™,Bremen, Germany). HPLC analyses were performed on an HP1260 Infinity Agilent High-Performance Liquid ChromatographySystem equipped with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA)(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) connected toan Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD, SEDERE, Orleans,France). The HPLC-based biactivity profiling was performed on anHP 1260 Agilent Infinity II High-Performance liquidchromatography equipped with a photodiode array detector(HPLC-PDA) and a sample collector (Agilent Technologies,Santa Clara, CA, United States). Flash chromatography wasperformed on a Sepacore instrument (Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland)composed of a pumpmodule C-605, fraction collector model C-620,and UV spectrophotometer model C-640. The semi-preparativeHPLC was performed using a Shimadzu system consisting of LC-20A module pumps, an SPD-20A UV/Vis detector, a 7725IRheodyne® valve, and an FRC-10A fraction collector (Shimadzu,Kyoto, Japan). The system was controlled using the LabSolutionssoftware from Shimadzu. NMR spectroscopic data were acquired ona Bruker Avance Neo 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a QCI5 mm Cryoprobe and a sampleJet automated extract changer(Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Chemical shifts arereported in parts per million (ppm, δ), and coupling constantsare reported in Hertz (Hz, J). The residual CD3OD/CDCl3 signals(δH 3.31/7.26, δC 49.8/77.16) were used as internal standards for 1Hand 13C, respectively. Comprehensive assignments were based on2D-NMR spectroscopy techniques such as COSY, edited-HSQC,HMBC, and ROESY. Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD)measurements were measured using a JASCO J-815 spectrometer(Loveland, CO, United States) in methanol, utilizing a 1 cm cell. Thescan speed was set at 200 nm/min in continuous mode, scanningFIGURE 7Proposed biosynthesis for the bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-dione core of compounds 1,2,4,6, and 8-13.Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org15Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982from 400 nm to 165 nm. Optical rotations were determined inmethanol using a JASCO P-1030 polarimeter (Loveland, CO,United States) with a 1 mL, 10 cm tube.Extraction of plant materialPFL supplied the dried, grounded leaves of H. punctata(Phyllanthaceae) (identifier V114372GP-01). This plant was part ofthe PFL collection registered with the European Commission on 1 April2020, under accession number 03-FR-2020. This official registrationacknowledges the collection’s compliancewith legal standards for accessand management. It signifies that the PFL collection adheres to theEuropean Access and Benefit Sharing Regulation criteria, whichenforces the Nagoya Protocol’s directives at the European level.These directives pertain to accessing genetic resources and justlysharing the benefits derived from their use (Nagoya Protocol, 2011).A mass of 55 g was extracted in a 100 mL pressure-resistantstainless steel extraction cell using an ASE system. At the bottom andthe top of the cell, a cellulose filter (Dionex™ 100, ThermoScientific™, Bremen, Germany) was added to prevent solidparticles from reaching the internal system. The cell wasextracted with 60% rinse volume under pressure at 40°C, threecycles, and a static time of 5 min per cycle. The sample was extractedsuccessively with HPLC quality hexane (Fisher Chemicals, Reinach,Switzerland), ethyl acetate (Fisher Chemicals, Reinach, Switzerland),and methanol (Fisher Chemicals, Reinach, Switzerland). Theresulting extracts were dried at 35°C under vacuum in a rotaryevaporator to yield 0.32 g of hexanic extract (HPH), 1.13 g of ethylacetate extract (HPE), and 2.60 g of methanolic extract (HPM).HPLC-based fractioning of HPE extract forbioactivity profilingA mass of 10 mg of HPE was dissolved in 200 μL of DMSO(molecular biology grade, Sigma, St Louis, United States) and thenseparated on an X-Bridge C18 column (250 × 10 mm i. d., 5 μm)equipped with aWaters C18 precolumn cartridge holder (5 × 10 mmi. d., 5 μm). The flow rate was set to 3.700 mL/min, and a binarysolvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid [A] and 0.1%formic acid in ACN [B] (Fisher Chemicals, Reinach, Switzerland)was used. A gradient (v/v) of [B] was employed as follows [t(min), %B]: 0.00, 2; 2.00, 2; 6.00, 50; 30.00, 100; 34.0, 100; followed by re-equilibration steps (36.00, 2; 40.00, 2). The collection was done at afixed fraction volume of 1.600 mL per well (96-W 2 mL Deep WellPlate, Scientific Specialties Inc., California, United States).A 100 µL aliquot of each well was pooled (row-wise and column-wise) in a preweighted vial and then dried under an N2 flux. Afterweighing, each pooled sample was reconstituted in DMSO at5 mg/mL.Isolation of compounds from theHPE extractThe HPE (1.1 g) was separated on a Puriflash C18-HP column(200 × 30 mm I.D., 15 μm, Interchim, Montlucon, France) on aBuchi system. The flow rate was set to 60 mL/min, and a binarysolvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid [A] and 0.1%formic acid in acetonitrile [B] was used. A gradient (v/v) of [B] wasemployed as follows [t(min), %B]: 0.00, 2; 3.70, 10; 73.50, 65; 84.00,100; 94.00, 100. The collection was done by a fixed fraction volumeof 50 mL per tube. After combining tubes based on the 254 nm and280 nm UV traces, a total of 24 fractions were obtained. Thisseparation yielded 31 mg of 1 (RT 74.0 min), 33.5 mg of 4 (RT78.0 min), and 48.5 mg of 8 (RT 83.0 min). The fractions collected atRT 76.0 min (F13, 19.8 mg) and RT 81.0 min (F15, 23.0 mg) wereseparated in an X-Bridge C18 column (250 × 10 mm i. d., 5 μm)equipped with aWaters C18 precolumn cartridge holder (5 × 10 mmi. d., 5 μm); solvent system ACN B) and H2O A), both containing0.1% FA, in an isocratic run 50% ACN, to give 2 (1.0 mg, RT38.5 min), and 3 (0.6 mg, RT 42.0 min); and 6 (0.5 mg, RT 45.0 min)respectively. The following separations were done using the samesolvent system and column but different isocratic compositions.The fraction F17 (RT 85.0 min, 48.4 mg) was separated using anisocratic of 55% ACN to give 5 (1.0 mg, RT 36.0 min), 8 (1.7 mg,RT 38.0 min), 9 (2.2 mg, RT 41.0 min) and 10 (2.3 mg, RT43.5 min). The fractions F18 (RT 87.5 min, 25.7 mg), and F19(RT 88.0 min, 26.9 mg) were separated using an isocratic of 60%ACN to give 7 (0.4 mg, RT 26 min), and 11 (1.7 mg, RT41.0 min).

Thecalculations were based on the relative configuration determinedthrough NMR 2D ROESY experiments. The structures were used tofind the conformers through a random rotor search algorithm (numberof conformers, 100) employing the MMFF94s force field in Avogradov1.2.0 (Hanwell et al., 2012). The conformers were further optimizedusing PM3 and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis sets in Gaussian 16 software (©2015-2022, Gaussian Inc., Wallingford, CT, United States of America)with the SCRF model in methanol (Nugroho and Morita, 2014; Mándiand Kurtán, 2019). All optimized conformers were checked forimaginary frequencies. The conformers were subjected to ECDcalculations using TD-DFT B3LYP/def2svp as a basis set and anSCRF model in methanol in Gaussian16 software. The calculatedECD spectrum was generated in SpecVis1.71 software (Berlin,Germany) based on a Boltzmann-weighted average. SupplementaryFigure S6 shows the results. The ECD calculations were performed onthe HPC Baoab cluster at the University of Geneva.UHPLC-HRMS2 analysisAnalyses were performed with a Vanquish Horizon (ThermoScientific, Germany) equiped with a binary pump H, a dual splitsampler HT and a Diode Array detector FG coupled to an OrbitrapExploris 120 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Germany) and aCorona Veo RS Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD, Thermo Scientific,Germany). The Orbitrap employes a heated electrospray ionizationsource (H-ESI) with the following parameters: spray voltage: +3.5 kV;ion transfer tube temperature: 320.00°C; vaporizer temperature:320.00°C; S-lens RF: 45 (arb units); sheath gas flow rate: 35.00 (arbunits); Sweep Gas (arb): 1, and auxiliary gas flow rate: 10.00 (arb. units).The mass analyzer was calibrated using a mixture of caffeine,methionine−arginine−phenylalanine− alanine−acetate (MRFA),sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium taurocholate, and Ultramark1,621 in an acetonitrile/methanol/water solution containing 1%formic acid by direct injection. Control of the instruments was doneusing Thermo Scientific Xcalibur software v. 4.6.67.17. Full scans wereacquired at a resolution of 30,000 fwhm (atm/z 200) and MS2 scans at15,000 fwhm in the range of 100–1,000m/z, with one microscan, time(ms): 200 m, an RF lens (%): 70; AGC target custom (Normalized AGCtarget (%): 300); maximum injection time (ms): 130;Microscans: 1; datatype: profile; Use EASY-IC(TM): ON.

Isotope Exclusion:Assigned and unassigned with an exclusion window (m/z) forunassigned isotopes: 8. The Intensity threshold was set to 2.5E5. anda targeted mass exclusion list was used. The centroid data-dependentMS2 (dd-MS2) scan acquisition events were performed in discoverymode, triggered by Apex detection with a trigger detection (%) of300 with a maximum injection time of 120 m, performing onemicroscan. The top three abundant precursors (charge states oneand 2) within an isolation window of 1.2 m/z were considered forMS/MS analysis. For precursor fragmentation in the HCD mode, anormalized collision energy of 15, 30, 45% was used. Data was recordedin profile mode (Use EASY-IC(TM): ON).The chromatographic separation was done on a Waters BEHC18 column (50 × 2.1 mm i. d., 1.7 μm, Waters, Milford, MA) usinga gradient as follows (time (min), %B): 0.5, 8.2; 7,99; 8,99; 8.10,8.2;9.75, 8.2. The mobile phases were A) water with 0.1% formic acidand B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set to600 μL/min, the injection volume was 1 μL, and the column was keptat 40 °C. The PDA detector was used from 210 to 400 nm with aresolution of 1.2 nm. The CAD was kept at 40°C, 5 bar N2, andpower function one for a data collection rate of 20 Hz.Data conversionAll raw data files were converted using ThermoRawFileParserv.1.4.0.101 (https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser)(Hulstaert et al., 2020).MZmine data preprocessingThe converted files were processed with MZmine3 (Schmid et al.,2023). For mass detection at the MS1 level, the noise level was set to1.0 E6. For MS2 detection, the noise level was set to 0.00. The ADAPchromatogram builder parameters were set as follows: Minimumconsecutive scans, 5; Minimum intensity for consecutive scans,1.0 E6; Minimum absolute height, 1.0 E6, and m/z tolerance of0.0020 or 10.0 ppm. The Local minimum feature resolver algorithmwas used for chromatogram deconvolution with the followingparameters: Chromatographic threshold, 80; Minimum search rangeRT/Mobility (absolute), 0.10; Minimum relative height, 1%; Minimumabsolute height, 1.0 E6; Min ratio of peak top/edge, 1.0; peak durationrange, 0.01–1.0 min; Minimum scans, 5. Isotopes were detected usingthe 13C isotope filter with an m/z tolerance of 0.0050 or 8.0 ppm, aRetention Time tolerance of 0.05 min (absolute), the maximum chargeset at 2, and the representative isotope used was the most intense. Eachfile was filtered to remove duplicates using the Duplicate peak filter withan m/z tolerance of 0.005 or 10 ppm and an RT tolerance of 0.10 min.The Feature list row filter was used to filter with the followingparameters: Minimum features in an isotope pattern, 2; Retentiontime, 0.50–7.00 min; Feature duration range: 0.1–1.0 min; and onlythe ions with an associated MS2 spectrum were kept. The resultingfiltered list was subjected to Ion Identity Networking (Schmid et al.,2021) starting with the metaCorrelate module (RT tolerance, 0.10 min;minimum height, 1.0 E5; Intensity correlation threshold 1.0 E5 and theCorrelationGrouping with the default parameters). Followed by the Ionidentity networking (m/z tolerance, 8.0 ppm; check: one feature;Minimum height: 1.0 E3, Ion identity library [maximum charge, 2;maximum molecules/cluster, 2; Adducts ([M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M +K]+, [M + NH4]+, [M+2H]2+), Modifications ([M-H2O], [M-2H2O],[M-CO2], [M + HFA], [M + ACN])], Annotation refinement (DeleteFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org20Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982small networks without major ion, yes; Delete networks withoutmonomer, yes), Add ion identities networks (m/z tolerance, 8 ppm;Minimum height, 1.0 E5; Annotation refinement (Minimum size, 1;Delete small networks without major ion, yes; Delete small networks:Link threshold, 4; Delete networks without monomer, yes)) and Checkall ion identities by MS/MS (m/z tolerance (MS2)), 10 ppm; min-height(inMS2), 1.0 E3; Check formultimers, yes; Check neutral losses (MS1 ->MS2), yes) modules. The resulting aligned peak list was exported as a.mgf file for further analysis.Spectral organization through molecularnetworkingAmolecular network for HPE was constructed from the.mgf fileexported from MZmine3, using the FBMN workflow on the GNPSplatform (Wang et al., 2016; Nothias et al., 2020). The precursor ionmass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da with an MS2 fragment iontolerance of 0.02 Da. A network was created where edges werefiltered to have a cosine score above 0.7 and more than sixmatched peaks. The spectra in the network were then searchedagainst GNPS’ spectral libraries. All matches between network andlibrary spectra were required to have a score above 0.6, and at leastthree matched peaks.

The resulting annotations weresubjected to taxonomically informed metabolite scoring (https://taxonomicallyinformedannotation.github.io/tima-r/, v 2.8.2) andre-ranking (Rutz et al., 2019) from the chemotaxonomicinformation available on LOTUS (Rutz et al., 2022). The in silicodatabase used for this process includes the combined records of theDictionary of Natural Products (DNP, v30.2) and the LOTUSInitiative outputs.SIRIUS metabolite annotationThe SIRIUS.mgf file exported fromMZmine3 (using the SIRIUSexport module) that contains MS1 and MS2 information wasprocessed with SIRIUS (v5.6.3) (Dührkop et al., 2019). Theparameters were set as follows: Possible ionizations: [M + H]+,[M + NH4]+, [M-H2O + H]+, [M + K]+, [M + Na]+, [M-4H2O + H]+;Instrument profile: Orbitrap; Mass accuracy: 5 ppm for MS1 and7 ppm for MS2, the Database for molecular formulas and structures:BIO, Maximum m/z to compute: 1,000. ZODIAC was used toimprove molecular formula prediction using a threshold filter of0.99 (Ludwig et al., 2020). Metabolite structure prediction was madewith CSI: FingerID (Dührkop et al., 2015) and the significance wascomputed with COSMIC (Hoffmann et al., 2022). The chemicalclass prediction was made with CANOPUS (Dührkop et al., 2021)using the NPClassifier chemical taxonomy (Kim et al., 2021).Wnt activity assessing assayCell lines and culture conditionsThe BT-20, HCC1395 and HEK293 cell lines were cultured andutilized in experimental conditions in Dulbecco’s Modified Medium(Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serumand 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2.Luciferase-based assay of the Wnt-dependenttranscriptional activityPurifiedWnt3a was obtained frommouse L-cells stably transfectedwithWnt3a, as previously described (Willert et al., 2003), with our ownmodifications (Xu et al., 2020). The 3 cell lines, stably transfected withthe M50 Super 8×TopFlash plasmid, were seeded at a density of6,000 cells/well in white tissue-culture-treated 384-well plates in20 µL/well maintenance medium. The cells were also transfectedwith the pCMV-RL plasmid to allow for constitutive expression ofRenilla luciferase, using XtremeGENE nine reagent according to themanufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h post-transfection, the medium wasreplaced with 2-fold indicated concentrations of compounds in 10 µL/well maintenance medium. Following a 1-h preincubation, Wnt3a wasadded to a final concentration of 500 ng/mL in an additional 10 µL/wellvolume. After a further 24 h of incubation, the medium was removedand measurements were taken using a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO platereader equipped with a two-channel dispensing unit by injectingsequentially 15 µL of each of the buffer solutions for activitymeasurements of firefly and Renilla luciferase, as describedpreviously (Boudou et al., 2022). The resulting dose-response datafor this and the MTT assay were fitted using GraphPad Prism ninesoftware (v9.4.0, Boston, United States) to obtain IC50 values. Since theassay is designed to not use positive control compounds, an extract orcompound is considered ‘toxic’ if the IC50 value against Renillaluciferase is less than 1.7-fold of estimated TopFlash one, indicatingthat the decrease observed in TopFlash response is affected by a strongtoxic effect.ConclusionThe findings of this study demonstrate the potential ofcombining Inventa’s structural novelty scores with bioactivityresults for guiding the discovery of structurally novel bioactiveNPs in collections of NEs. Through the evaluation of Wnt-regulation activity results and Inventa’s scores, a collection of1,600 NEs was narrowed down to four active NEs with a highpotential of containing structural novel NPs.Inventa’s multifaceted approach to evaluating structural richness anddissimilarities among extracts proves instrumental in this process. Byassessing individual features within each extract and comparing theoverall spectral space, Inventa effectively identifies extracts withpotentially unknown specialized metabolisms. Through the integrationof data from these two levels and the incorporation of literature reports forthe taxon, Inventa highlights extracts with high novelty potential. Thepriority score, derived from its four components provides acomprehensive evaluation of the NEs potential of containing novelNPs. While Inventa’s novelty scores may not directly correlate withobserved bioactivity, they play a crucial role in prioritizing NEs andreducing selection prior to in-depth phytochemical study. This approachFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org21Quiros-Guerrero et al. 10.3389/fchem.2024.1371982mitigates the risk of prioritizing known NPs and underscores theimportance of employing comprehensive bioinformatics approaches insample selection. Thus, Inventa empowers researchers to identify NEsharboring structurally novel NPs with potential therapeutic applications.The subsequent phytochemical investigation of H. punctata leavesled to the isolation of ten novel bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-diones andthree knownprenylatedflavones. Some of the newly isolated compoundsexhibited appreciable IC50 values and showedno apparent cytotoxicity inthree different cell lines, indicating their potential as Wnt inhibitorycompounds. This work illustrates the utility of Inventa in assisting theefficient selection of active NEs from large sample collections for theidentification of novel and bioactive NPs.Data availability statementThe mzML and raw UHPLC-HMRMS2 data for all the H.punctata de novo extract, can be accessed through MassIVE withthe accession number MSV000092572.
