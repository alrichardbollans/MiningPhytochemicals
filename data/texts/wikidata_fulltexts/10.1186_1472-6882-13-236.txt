The lack of effective and widelyapplicable pharmacological treatments for ischemic stroke patients may explain a growing interest in traditionalmedicines. β-Asarone, which has significant pharmacological effects on the central nervous system (CNS), was usedin the prevention of cerebral ischemia in this paper.Methods: The right middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used in the study. The effects of β-Asarone onmortality rate, neurobehavior, grip strength, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione content, Lipid peroxidation,glutathione peroxidase activity, glutathione reductase activity, catalase activity, Na+-K+-ATPase activity andglutathione S transferase activity in a rat model were studied respectively.Results: β-Asarone significantly improved the neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion interms of neurobehavioral function in rats. Meanwhile, supplementation of β-Asarone significantly boosted the defensemechanism against cerebral ischemia via increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis. Restoration ofthe antioxidant homeostasis in the brain after reperfusion may help the brain recover from ischemic injury.Conclusions: These experimental results suggest that complement β-Asarone is protective against cerebral ischemia inspecific way. The administration of β-Asarone could reduce focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. The Mechanismof β-Asarone in protection of cerebral ischemia was via increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis.BackgroundIschemic hypoxic brain injury often causes irreversiblebrain damage. The cascade of events leading to neuronalinjury and death in ischemia includes the release of cyto-kines and free radicals, and induction of inflammation,apoptosis, and excitotoxicity [1]. Reperfusion of ischemicareas could exacerbate ischemic brain damage throughthe generation of reactive oxygen species. The lack of ef-fective and widely applicable pharmacological treatmentsfor ischemic stroke patients may explain a growing inter-est in traditional medicines.Acorus tatarinowii Schott is native to Central Asia,North America and Eastern Europe [2]. β-Asarone* Correspondence: lichangyuzj@126.com; guojianyou@126.com1Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, PR China2Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academyof Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China© 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central LtCommons Attribution License (http://creativecreproduction in any medium, provided the or(cis-2,4,5-trimethoxy-1-allyl phenyl), which can affectthe central nervous system (CNS) [3-6], is a major com-ponent of Acorus tatarinowii Schott. β-Asarone couldpass the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and thus enter thebrain [7]. It has been reported that β-Asarone (Figure 1)could attenuate neuronal apoptosis in rat hippocampusand might be a potential candidate for development as atherapeutic agent to manage cognitive impairment asso-ciated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease [8,9].Other authors found β-Asarone could reduce the tox-icity of excitatory amino acids and increase the expres-sion of c-fos in the epileptic rat brain [10]. In addition,β-Asarone could reduce the injuries of blood vesselendothelium and nerve cells of the cortex [11] and im-prove the cognitive function of the beta-amyloid hippo-campus injection rats [12].d.

Dr. Changyu Li at the Zhejiang Chinese MedicalUniversity established the identity of these species.β-Asarone was obtained as reported by Zanoli et al. [13].Purity up to 99.55% was confirmed by gas chromatog-raphy–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), infrared spectrum(IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection.The voucher specimen (No. SAC/20120412) was depos-ited at the Herbarium of the College of Pharmacology,Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, China.Experimental designThe animals were separated into five groups of ten ratseach. The first group served as sham (SHAM). The sec-ond group was the ischemic group (MCAO). Group Iand group II were treated orally by distilled water for30 days respectively. Group III (β-Asarone−10), GroupIV (β-Asarone−20) and Group V (β-Asarone−30) weretreated orally by β-Asarone (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg/day,respectively) for 30 days followed by middle cerebral ar-tery occlusion (MCAO) induced cerebral ischemia.The right MCAO was performed using an intraluminalfilament model and the method described by Liu et al.[14]. In brief, the rats were anesthetized with chloral hy-drate (400 mg/kg, i.p.), a 4-0 nylon monofilament with ablunt end was introduced into the external carotid artery(ECA) and advanced into the middle cerebral artery viathe internal carotid artery (ICA) (17-20 mm), until aslight resistance was felt. Successful occlusion was con-firmed by an 87-90% reduction in cerebral blood flow(CBF), as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry [15].Table 2 Effect of β-Asarone on serum LDH levelsDifferent groups LDH (IU/L) F-values df-values p-valuesMCAO group 156.200 ± 3.331SHAM group 80.200 ± 1.233*** 6.555 5.183 0.000β-Asarone-10 group 166.600 ± 2.111 7.190 11 0.118β-Asarone-20 group 126.630 ± 3.111** 7.490 5.063 0.001β-Asarone-30 group 111.231 ± 2.111** 0.425 11 0.005Values are shown as means ± SEM. **p <0.01 vs. MCAO group, ***p <0.001 vs.MCAO group.Table 3 Effect of β-Asarone on Hippocampus GSHDifferentgroupsHippocampus GSH(nmol GSH/mg protein)F-values df-values p-valuesMCAOgroup0.760 ± 0.035SHAMgroup2.398 ± 0.013** 7.993 6.286 0.009β-Asarone-10 group1.115 ± 0.005 1.860 11 0.379β-Asarone-20 group2.565 ± 0.015** 6.536 6.400 0.008β-Asarone-30 group1.333 ± 0.002* 2.965 11 0.025Values are shown as means ± SEM. *p <0.05 vs. MCAO group, **p < 0.01 vs.MCAO group.Table 5 Effect of β-Asarone on LPO levelDifferent groups nmol LPO/gproteinF-values df-values p-valuesMCAO group 20.21 ± 1.41SHAM group 13.23 ± 0.66** 5.254 6.996 0.003β-Asarone-10group20.01 ± 0.21 19.460 5.010 0.846β-Asarone-20group15.32 ± 0.11* 1.304 10 0.043β-Asarone-30group15.22 ± 0.21* 1.305 10 0.042Values are shown as means ± SEM. *p <0.05 vs. MCAO group, **p < 0.01 vs.MCAO group.Yang et al.

Throughout the procedure, the body temperaturewas maintained at 37°C, with a thermostatically con-trolled infrared lamp. In sham rats, the ECA was surgi-cally prepared for the insertion of the filament, but thefilament was not inserted. The final number of rats wasas follows: SHAM group n = 10; MCAO group n = 6;β-Asarone-10 group n = 8; β-Asarone−20 group n = 8and β-Asarone−30 group n = 9.Neurobehavioral testThe sensorimotor integrity was conducted to assess theneurobehavior at 24 h after MCAO in rats [16]. Fivecategories of motor neurological findings were scored: 0,no observable deficit; 1, forelimb flexion; 2, forelimbflexion and decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, fore-limb flexion, decreased resistance to lateral push andunilateral circling; 4, forelimb flexion, unable or difficultto ambulate. Animals that showed the features of thehigher scores also showed all the features of the lowergrades.Table 4 Effect of β-Asarone on Cerebral cortex GSHDifferentgroupsCerebral cortex GSH(nmol GSH/mg protein)F-values df-values p-valuesMCAOgroup1.112 ± 0.010SHAMgroup1.823 ± 0.026* 4.193 11 0.017β-Asarone-10 group1.195 ± 0.021 4.043 11 0.336β-Asarone-20 group1.595 ± 0.053* 3.306 11 0.026β-Asarone-30 group1.395 ± 0.011* 3.418 11 0.427Values are shown as means ± SEM. *p <0.05 vs. MCAO group.Grip strength studyGrip strength in all the animals was measured forevaluation of neuromuscular strength, as described byAli et al. [17]. The neuromuscular strength tests werecarried out between 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. under stand-ard laboratory conditions.Tissue preparationAfter grip strength measurement, blood samples weredrawn from the tail vein from all the groups and serumwas separated for biochemical estimations. Thereafter,the animals were sacrificed immediately and their brainswere taken out to dissect the hippocampus (HIP). Post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) obtained from 10%homogenate of tissue was used for the estimation ofvarious parameters related with oxidative stress.Biochemical estimationsIn serum, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimatedusing a method described by Khan et al. [18]. The PMSand HIP were used for the assay of glutathione (GSH)content, Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione peroxid-ase (GPx) activity, glutathione reductase (GR) activity,catalase (CAT) activity, Na+-K+-ATPase activity andglutathione S transferase (GST) activity [19-24].Statistical analysisThe data are expressed as mean ± SEM.

Theneurobehavior for the SHAM group was 0.9 (0.6-1.1),the MCAO group was 3.7 (2.6-5.3), the β-Asarone−10group was 3.0 (2.2-4.1), the β-Asarone−20 group was 1.2(1.0-4.1) and the β-Asarone−30 group was 1.0 (1.0-3.0).It is clear that the behavioral abnormality was signifi-cantly developed in the MCAO group as compared withthe sham (Figure 2). In contrast, the β-Asarone−20 groupand β-Asarone−30 group significantly suppressed the de-velopment of behavioral abnormality as compared withthe MCAO group (Figure 2).The grip strength in the SHAM group was found tobe 0.888 ± 0.008 kg units. A significant decrease inthe grip strength was observed in the MCAO group(0.506 ± 0.002), as compared to the sham rats (P < 0.01).Both β-Asarone−20 and β-Asarone−30 treated ratsshowed a significant increase in grip strength, as com-pared to the MCAO group (P < 0.01) (Table 1).Increasing evidence has indicated that ischemia/reper-fusion occurs due to oxidative stress that may potentiateTable 8 Effect of β-Asarone on the activity of GSTDifferent groups GST F-values df-values p-valuesMCAO 10.17 ± 1.10SHAM 15.11 ± 1.20** 16.088 13 0.002β-Asarone-10group 11.60 ± 1.07 9.946 10 0.680β-Asarone-20 group 13.61 ± 1.98** 19.214 11 0.008β-Asarone-30group 12.66 ± 1.80* 20.293 12 0.029Values are shown as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05 vs. MCAO group, **p < 0.01 vs.MCAO group.ischemic injury [25]. Lactate dehydrogenase was mea-sured to evaluate the role of antioxidative stress in theprotection of β-Asarone. The serum LDH levels inSHAM group were found to be 80.200 ± 1.233 IU/L. Asignificant increase in the activity of LDH in serum wasobserved in MCAO group, as compared to the SHAMgroup; whereas, β-Asarone−20 and β-Asarone−30 treat-ment significantly resulted in decreased serum LDHlevels when compared with MCAO group rats (Table 2).Reduced glutathione (GSH) is one of the primary en-dogenous antioxidant defense systems in the brain,which removes hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides.Decline in GSH levels could either increase or reflectoxidative status [26,27]. Concentrations of GSH werelower in MCAO group than those in SHAM group(Tables 3 and 4). β-Asarone−20 treatment significantlyincreased the GSH.level. The same results did occur inthe β-Asarone−30 group. It can be attributed to severalfactors such as cleavage GSH to cysteine, decrease in thesynthesis of GSH and the formation of mixed disulfides,causing their cellular stores to be depleted [28].The large numbers of polyunsaturated fatty acids makecell membranes particularly vulnerable to lipid peroxida-tion. The oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids altersthe structure of the membrane with resultant changes influidity and permeability. Lipid peroxidation can also in-hibit the function of membrane bound receptors and en-zymes [29]. The level of LPO content adds to the proofof the increased peroxidative damage during cerebral is-chemia. A significant increase in the content of LPO wasobserved in the MCAO group when compared with theSHAM group.

Therefore, the measurement of en-dogenous antioxidants enzymes i.e. GPx, GR, CAT andGST as well as Na+-K+-ATPase has been performed toestimate the amount of oxidative stress. Activities of variousantioxidant enzymes and Na+-K+-ATPase of differentgroups have been listed in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The ac-tivity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes was decreasedsignificantly in the MCAO group, as compared to the shamgroup, whereas in the β-Asarone−20 group, β-Asarone-treatment showed a significant restoration in the level ofvarious enzymes as compared with MCAO group. Thesame results did occur in the β-Asarone−30 group.A great deal of effort has been directed towardsearching for a new drug that can be used for protectionof cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. β-Asarone wasused in the prevention of cerebral ischemia in this paper.Here we showed that the β-Asarone significantly im-proved the neurological outcome after cerebral ischemiaand reperfusion in terms of neurobehavioral function inrats. At the same time, supplementation of β-Asaronesignificantly boosted the defense mechanism againstcerebral ischemia by increasing antioxidants activity re-lated to lesion pathogenesis. Restoration of the antioxi-dant homeostasis in the brain after reperfusion may helpthe brain recover from ischemic injury.ConclusionsThese experimental results suggest that complementβ-Asarone is protective after cerebral ischemia in specificway. The administration of β-Asarone significantly reducedfocal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. The defensemechanism against cerebral ischemia was by increasing an-tioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsGJY and LCY: designed the experiment; YYX and CYT: conducted researchand drafting of the manuscript; ZXJ: acquisition of data; analysis andinterpretation of data; statistical analysis; HCL: review of the manuscript;analysis and interpretation of data.
