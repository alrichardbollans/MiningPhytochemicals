Phyllanthus emblica L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a shrub or treenative to subtropical and tropical areas of China, India, In-donesia and the Malay Peninsula. The fruit has been widelyused for antiinflammatory and antipyretic treatment. Theroot, leaves and bark are also used for the treatment of indi-gestion, diarrhea or dysentery, eczema and wart. As a contin-uation of investigation on the constituents of this plant,1—5)we chemically examined its leaves and branches, and twonew acylated flavanone glycosides, a new phenolic glycoside,and 22 known compounds were isolated. This paper de-scribes the isolation and structural elucidation of these com-pounds.Results and DiscussionAs described in the previous paper,2) the EtOH extract ofthe fresh leaves and branches of P. emblica was suspended inwater and then extracted with Et2O. The Et2O layer was parti-tioned between hexane and MeOH, and the MeOH layer wasfurther chromatographed successively over Sephadex LH-20,silica gel, MCI-gel CHP 20P and Chromatorex ODS to afford 1 and 2, as well as 17 known compounds. The known ones were identified as naringenin,6) eriodictyol,6)kaempferol,7) dihydrokaempferol,8,9) quercetin,7) naringenin7-O-glucoside (prunin),10) naringenin 7-O-(60-O-galloyl)-glu-coside,10) naringenin 7-O-(60-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-gluco-side,11) kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside,7) quercetin 3-O-rham-noside,7) myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside,7) 2-(2-methylbutyryl)-phloroglucinol 1-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (multifidol gluco-side) (5),12) (2)-epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate,13) 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-,14) 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-,15) and 1,2,3,4,5-penta-O-galloyl-b-D-glucose,16) and decarboxyellagic acid17) by comparison of thephysical and spectral data with literature values.The water layer was separated first by Sephadex LH-20column chromatography,2) and the obtained fraction 1 wassubjected to MCI-gel CHP 20P, Chromatorex ODS, and sil-ica gel to afford 3, together with 8 known constituents identi-fied as eriodictyol 7-O-glucoside (4),18) kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-O-gluco-side,7) myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside, rutin,19) 3-O-methylellagicacid 49-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside20) and tuberonic (12-OH-jasmonic) acid glucoside.21) The last compound was first iso-lated from the potato leaves as a tuber-inducing stimulus22)and found to be a leaf-closing substance of Albizzia julib-rissin.21) This is the first time that tuberonic acid glucosidewas obtained from P. emblica, which has a nyctinastic move-ment. Compound 1, a yellow amorphous powder, had a molecu-lar formula C30H28O13 on the basis of its 13C-NMR spectraldata (Table 1), negative-ion FAB-MS [m/z 595, (M2H)2]and elemental analysis. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of 1were closely related to those of eriodictyol 7-O-glucoside(4),18) except for the appearance of additional signals [d 7.52,6.35 (each d, J516.0 Hz) and d 7.49, 6.79 (each 2H, d,J58.5 Hz)] arising from a trans-p-coumaroyl group. Acidichydrolysis of 1 in aqueous MeOH yielded eriodictyol, D-glu-cose and coumaric acid methyl ester, confirming the compo-nents of the molecule 1. The location of the p-coumaroyl wasdetermined to be the glucose C-60 position on the basis of thedownfield shift of the glucose C-60 (d 63.3) and H-60 [d 4.42(dd, J52.0, 12.0 Hz) and 4.14 (dd, J56.5, 12.0 Hz)] by com-parison with those of eriodictyol 7-O-glucoside [dC 60.8; dH4.03, 3.85]. The linkage of the glucopyranosyl moiety at the7-hydroxyl group of eriodictyol was confirmed by theHMBC correlation between the glucose H-10 (d 5.05, d,J57.5 Hz) and C-7 (d 165.1). The absolute stereochemistryat C-2 was assigned to be S by observation of a positive Cot-ton effect at 337 nm and a negative one at 294 nm in the cir-June 2002 Notes Chem. Pharm.

R. China.Received November 28, 2001; accepted February 18, 2002Two new acylated flavanone glycosides, (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(60-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside(1) and (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(60-O-galloyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (2) were isolated from the leaves and branches ofPhyllanthus emblica together with a new phenolic glycoside, 2-(2-methylbutyryl)phloroglucinol 1-O-(60-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (3), as well as 22 known compounds. Their structures were determined byspectral and chemical methods. Key words Phyllanthus emblica; Euphorbiaceae; acylated flavanone glycosidecular dichroism (CD) spectrum.23,24) Therefore, the structureof 1 was established as (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(60-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside.Compound 2 was obtained as a yellow amorphous powderand gave dark blue coloration with the ferric chloridereagent. Comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data(Table 1) with those of 1 showed that their structures werevery similar except for the presence of a galloyl group in 2instead of the coumaroyl group in 1. The presence of the gal-loyl group in 2 could be easily recognized from the charac-teristic two-proton singlet at d 6.91 and seven sp2 carbon sig-nals [d 145.6 (2C), 138.6, 119.4, 108.8 (2C), 165.9] in the1H- and 13C-NMR spectra. Acidic hydrolysis of 2 yielded eri-odictyol, glucose and gallic acid, confirming that 2 was a gal-loyl ester of eriodictyol glucoside. The location of the esterwas determined to be at glucose C-60 on the basis of thelong-range correlations between the two methylene protonsof glucose H-60 and the galloyl carboxyl carbon (d 165.9)signals in the heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity(HMBC) spectrum. In addition, the HMBC correlation of theglucose anomeric proton (d 5.08, d, J57.5 Hz) with C-7 (d165.1) confirmed that the 60-O-galloylglucopyranosyl moietywas attached to the 7-hydroxyl group of eriodictyol. The ab-solute stereochemistry at C-2 was also assigned as S basedon a positive Cotton effect at 336 nm and a negative one at291 nm in the CD spectrum. Thus, the structure of 2 was de-termined as (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(60-O-galloyl)-b-D-glucopy-ranoside.Compound 3 had a molecular formula C22H32O13 on thebasis of the 13C-NMR spectral data (Table 1), the negative-ion FAB-MS [m/z 503, (M2H)2] and elemental analysis.The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data of 3 were similar tothose of 2-(2-methylbutyryl)phloroglucinol (multifidol) glu-coside (5)12) except for the appearance of a set of signals aris-ing from a pentose moiety. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectraldata (Table 1) due to the sugar moieties revealed the exis-tence of a 6-O-b-apiofuranosyl-b-glucopyranosyl moiety in3.25) Furthermore, hydrolysis of 3 yielded 2-(2-methylbu-tyryl)phloroglucinol (multifidol),12) D-glucose ([a]D 124.3°)and D-apiose ([a]D 16.5°). On the basis of the above results,3 was characterized as 2-(2-methylbutyryl)phloroglucinol 1-O-(60-O-b-D-apiofuranosyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside. The ab-solute configuration of C-29 was assigned as S according tothe positive Cotton effect at 280 nm in the CD spectrum.12)Up to now, we have studied the chemical constituents of the roots, fruit juice, and leaves and branches of P.emblica,1—5) and obtained a number of polyphenols andsesquiterpenoids which might be the potent bioactive princi-ples of the plant. Studies of the antioxidative and antiprolifer-ative activities of these components are now in progress. ExperimentalThe instruments used for obtaining physical data and experimental condi-tions for chromatography were the same as we described previously.2—5)Plant Material The leaves and branches of Phyllanthus emblica werecollected at Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, the People’s Republic of China. Avoucher specimen is deposited in the Herbarium of Kunming Institute ofBotany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Extraction and Isolation As described in the previous paper,2) theEtOH extract of the fresh leaves and branches (15 kg) of P. emblica was sus-pended in water and then partitioned with Et2O. After being concentrated todryness, the Et2O layer (198.0 g) was further partitioned between hexane andMeOH. The MeOH layer (100.34 g) was chromatographed over SephadexLH-20 (80—100% MeOH, and then 50% acetone) to give four fractions842 Vol. 50, No. 6Table 1. 13C-NMR Data of Compounds 1—51a) 2a) 4b) 3c) 5d)C-2 78.6 78.7 78.9 C-1 161.8 161.73 42.2 42.2 44.4 2 106.9 106.54 197.1 197.1 197.4 3 165.5 166.65 163.1 163.1 163.2 4 95.6 95.76 95.7 95.3 95.7 5 167.3 166.47 165.1 165.1 165.5 6 98.4 98.68 96.3 96.3 96.7 19 211.8 211.79 162.6 162.8 162.9 29 46.9 46.810 103.4 103.4 103.5 39 28.3 28.219 129.3 129.3 129.4 49 12.1 12.029 114.3 114.4 114.7 59 16.8 16.839 145.0 145.3 145.4 glu-10 101.7 101.549 145.8 145.9 146.0 20 74.8 74.759 115.4 115.4 115.6 30 78.6 f ) 78.669 118.1 118.3 118.4 40 71.3 71.1glu-10 99.4 99.4 99.8 50 78.0 f ) 78.220 73.0 73.1 73.2 60 68.6 62.430 76.2 76.1 77.3e) api-1- 110.940 69.9 69.3 69.7 2- 77.250 73.9 73.8 76.5e) 3- 80.560 63.3 63.0 60.8 4- 75.0Acyl group 5- 65.71- 125.1 119.42-,6- 130.3 108.83-,5- 115.9 145.64- 159.9 138.67- 145.3 165.98- 114.09- 166.5a) 125 MHz, in DMSO-d6. b) 75 MHz, in DMSO-d6. c) 75 MHz, in CD3OD. d) 100.6 MHz, in CD3OD. e, f ) Assignments may be interchanged in each column.(fractions 1—4).
