The aim ofthe present study was to evaluate a new pharmacological property of two natural triterpenoids contained in olive oil, as vasodilatory agents,and to determine their mechanism of action. The two compounds studied were oleanolic acid and erythrodiol. The vasorelaxant effectinduced by these pentacyclic triterpenoids was studied in isolated thoracic rat aorta. Oleanolic acid and erythrodiol, accumulativelyadded, showed vasorelaxant activities in aortic rings with endothelium pre-contracted by 1026 M-phenylephrine (maximum percentageof relaxation 86·38 (SEM 2·89) and 73·53 (SEM 6·01), respectively). They had almost no relaxant effect on depolarised or endothelium-denuded aortic segments. The relaxation was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nv-nitro-L-argi-nine-methylester (L-NAME; 3 £ 1024 M). To characterise the involvement of endothelial factors, in addition to NO, arteries withendothelium were exposed to 1025 M-indomethacin (INDO), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, or INDO plus L-NAME. INDO did not haveany significant effect on the relaxant response of both compounds. The combination of L-NAME plus INDO only abolished the oleanolicacid-induced relaxation. The present results suggest that the mechanism of relaxation seems to be mainly mediated by the endothelial pro-duction of NO; however, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. It can be concluded that oleanolic acid and erythrodiol may have inter-esting therapeutic potential as new vasodilator drugs, thus protecting the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the intake of ‘orujo’ olive oil,as a source of these compounds, might be beneficial in this regard.‘Orujo’ olive oil: Oleanolic acid: Erythrodiol: Vasorelaxation: Endothelium: Rat aortaEpidemiological studies and clinical trials demonstrate thata suitable diet may reduce the occurrence of cardiovasculardisorders (Keys, 1995). In recent years, there has been agrowing interest in fortified and enhanced foods, referredto as ‘functional foods’ or ‘nutraceuticals’. It is noteworthythat phytochemicals or components in these functionalfoods, when consumed at effective levels as part of avaried diet, may provide some health benefits (AmericanDietetic Association, 1999).The importance of olive oil as an integral ingredient ofthe Mediterranean diet is well known, and some evidencesuggests that it may have health benefits on inflammatoryand cardiovascular events (Visioli & Galli, 1998; De laPuerta et al. 1999; Perona & Ruı́z-Gutiérrez, 2000). Thevaried olive oil components seem to be responsible forthese therapeutic characteristics.‘Orujo’ olive oil, as called in Spain, is obtained bychemical processes from the mechanical extraction ofvirgin olive oil. To our knowledge, the potential thera-peutic significance of this olive sub-product has not yetbeen studied. It is expected that subsequent investigationswill allow the discovery of the functional properties of‘orujo’ olive oil, due to its potentially beneficial com-ponents (e.g. tetra- and pentacyclic triterpenes), whichare in a lower concentration in virgin and refined oliveoil (Vioque & Maza, 1963; Vázquez-Roncero & Janer,1969). The present study is focused on oleanolic acid(3b-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid) and erythrodiol(3b-olean-12-en-28-diol), a pentacyclic triterpenoid acidand alcohol respectively (Fig. 1). The solid waste called‘orujo’ resulting from the olive oil extraction contains ablend of olive leaves, cuticle and surface, which are asource of these triterpenoids. Thus, ‘orujo’ oil containsoleanolic acid and erythrodiol in a high concentration, incontrast to olive oil (Vioque & Morris, 1961; Pérez-Camino & Cert, 1999).* Corresponding author: Dr V.

Only the therapeutic efficiency oferythrodiol on different experimental models of inflam-mation has been reported (Recio et al. 1995; Mañez et al.1997; De la Puerta et al. 2000). However, many studies onoleanolic acid have been published. These reports havedemonstrated a very wide range of biological and pharma-cological properties of this triterpenoid acid. Many of themwere summarised by Liu (1995). These properties include,among others, anti-inflammatory (Ringbom et al. 1998;Honda et al. 2000), anti-tumoral (Hsu et al. 1997; Choiet al. 2001), hepatoprotective (Liu et al. 1998; Yim et al.2001), anti-diabetogenic (Matsuda et al. 1998; Yoshikawa& Matsuda, 2000) and anti-HIV activities (Kashiwada et al.1998; Zhu et al. 2001; Mengoni et al. 2002). There isscarce evidence about the pharmacological effects of ery-throdiol and oleanolic acid on vascular events; only thecardiovascular effects of oleanolic acid and its isomer urso-lic acid have been recently studied and published bySomova et al. (2003a,b). They have shown that the chronictreatment of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats withthese natural compounds prevents the development ofhypertension with significant bradycardia and potent diure-tic activity.Our interest in both oleanolic acid and erythrodiol on thecardiovascular system arises from their anti-inflammatoryproperties mentioned earlier. Inflammation has beenrecently linked to the atherogenic process, which alsoimpairs endothelial function (Libby, 2002), and it is relatedto vascular reactivity. Therefore, we now report for the firsttime a study of the possible vasodilatory effects of oleano-lic acid and erythrodiol in rat thoracic aorta and the influ-ence of endothelium-derived factors in these actions. Theunderlying mechanism implicated in their vasorelaxantresponses was also investigated, using different experimen-tal protocols.Materials and methodsExperimental animalsThe pharmacological experiments were carried out on adultmale Wistar rats (10–12 weeks old) weighing 250–300 g,and fed on standard rat chow with free access to drinkingwater. All experiments were performed according to theguidelines for the ethnical treatment of animals of theEuropean Union.Aortic ring preparationThe animals were killed by cervical dislocation and thedescending thoracic aorta was rapidly dissected andtransferred into modified Krebs–Henseleit solution of thefollowing composition (mM): NaCl, 118; KCl, 4·75;NaHCO3, 25; MgSO4, 1·2; CaCl2, 1·8; KH2PO4, 1·2;glucose, 11.The aortas were cleaned of adherent tissue and cut into2–3 mm rings. Each ring was fixed horizontally under aresting tension of 2 g in a 10 ml organ-bath filled withKrebs–Henseleit solution. The solution was continuouslykept at 378C and gassed with 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2 atpH 7·4. Mechanical activity was recorded isometricallyby a force-displacement transducer (Pioden UF-1; PiodenControls Ltd, Canterbury, Kent, UK) connected to aPowerlab data acquisition system (ADInstruments PtyLtd; Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia), as pre-viously described (Álvarez de Sotomayor et al. 2001).After an equilibration period of 60 min, aortic rings werecontracted with 1026 M-phenylephrine to test their contrac-tile capacity. In some experiments, the endothelial layerwas removed immediately after dissection by gently rub-bing the intimal surface of the intact vessel. The presenceof functional endothelium was confirmed in all prep-arations by determining the ability of 1026 M-acetylcholineto induce more than 50 % relaxation of rings pre-contractedwith 1026 M-phenylephrine. The absence of a relaxationresponse to acetylcholine was taken as evidence that theaortic segments were functionally denuded of endothelium.Vascular relaxation experimentsFor the assessment of vasorelaxation property and potency,the aortic rings were first pre-contracted at 80 % of theirmaximal contraction with 1026 M-phenylephrine or KCl(25 or 80 mM). When the contractile responses reached aplateau, cumulative concentrations of oleanolic acid or ery-throdiol (1027 to 1024 M) were added to the bath mediumat 20 min intervals (the time necessary to obtain a steady-state relaxation) to study the relaxation induced by thesetwo compounds. The same procedure was repeated inendothelium-denuded aortic rings.We also performed another set of experiments, in orderto elucidate the mechanism of action of oleanolic acid anderythrodiol. Rings with functional endothelium were pre-incubated with the following inhibitors: the NO synthaseinhibitor Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME;3 £ 1024 M), the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor indo-methacin (INDO; 1025 M), the thromboxane A2–prostaglan-din H2 receptor (Tp) antagonist, ICI 192,605 (1025M),or a combination of the superoxide anion (O22) scavenger,superoxide dismutase (SOD; 150 U/ml) plus the H2O2inactivator, catalase (1000 U/ml). Sarcoplasmic reticulumCa2þ–ATPase involvement was investigated by using3 £ 1025 M-cyclopiazonic acid, added to the bath at thesame time as phenylephrine. L-NAME and INDO were incu-bated with the tissues for 20 min before the pre-contractionwith the agonist. ICI 192,605 was incubated for 30 min,and the combination of SOD plus catalase was added15 min before the agonist application. Different aortic ringsfrom different animals were used in each experiment. Allthe results were expressed as a percentage of the maximalcontraction of phenylephrine-induced responses.Fig. 1.

Stock sol-utions were prepared in distilled deionised water except olea-nolic acid, erythrodiol, INDO, ICI 192,605 andcyclopiazonic acid, which were dissolved in dimethylsulfox-ide. The final dimethylsulfoxide concentration (,0·01 %) inthe tissue-bath did not significantly influence vascularresponses. All concentrations of the drugs used are expressedas their final concentration in the organ chamber.Statistical analysisResults are expressed as percentages from the initial pre-contraction level and as mean values and standard errorsof the mean of six to eight rats per group. Dose–responseslopes were analysed to give the concentration of oleanolicacid and erythrodiol required to produce 50 % of the maxi-mal relaxation. Statistically significant differences wereevaluated by an ANOVA followed by the least significantdifference test. P values of ,0·05 were considered to indi-cate a significant difference. In figures, all error bars havebeen removed, since they are smaller than the symbol size.The data analyses were performed with the GraphPadPrismw statistical package (version 3.00; GraphPad Soft-ware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).ResultsEffects on phenylephrine-induced contractions: influenceof endotheliumAs illustrated in Fig. 2, oleanolic acid and erythrodiolinduced a vasorelaxant response in a concentration-depen-dent manner in endothelium-intact aortas pre-contracted by1026 M-phenylephrine. The vasorelaxant effect of these tri-terpenoids was also analysed in mechanically denudedaortas. Removal of the endothelium markedly attenuatedthe relaxant effects on contractions evoked by phenyl-ephrine (Fig. 2). The maximal response to oleanolic acidor erythrodiol at 1024 M was decreased in aortic rings with-out endothelium (Table 1).Effects on potassium chloride-induced contractionsThe effects of oleanolic acid and erythrodiol on low(25 mM) and high (80 mM) KCl-evoked contractions werestudied. In aortic rings with an intact endothelial layerpre-contracted by 25 mM-KCl, both triterpenoids eliciteda moderate vasorelaxation (Fig. 3), with lower values ofmaximum percentage of relaxation, compared with thoseobtained in phenylephrine-contracted aortas. The maximalrelaxant effects of both triterpenoids in depolarised aortas(80 mM-KCl) were significantly lower than those obtainedin 25 mM-KCl-pre-contracted aortic segments (Table 1).Characterisation of endothelial factors involved in therelaxant effectTo measure the influence of NO on the endothelium-depen-dent relaxation induced by oleanolic acid or erythrodiol,the effect of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME(3 £ 1024 M), was studied. In these conditions, L-NAMEproduced a significant reduction of the relaxation inducedby both triterpenic compounds in endothelium-intact rataortic rings (Fig. 4). In another set of experiments, theinvolvement of prostanoids derived from the COX pathwayin the vasorelaxation was also tested. Some differencesbetween oleanolic acid responses and erythrodiol responseswere observed.The blockage of COX by 1025 M-INDO did not affectthe oleanolic acid-induced relaxation. However, whenNO synthase and COX were blocked together, the relax-ation response was significantly attenuated and this findingwas similar to that obtained in denuded arteries, as shownin Fig. 5 (A). When the aortas were incubated with the Tpreceptor antagonist ICI 192,605 (1025 M), the relaxation ofarteries pre-contracted with phenylephrine induced byoleanolic acid was not altered (Fig. 6 (A)).On the other hand, for erythrodiol, pre-treatment ofthe rings with 1025 M-INDO did not affect the endo-thelium-dependent vasorelaxation (Fig. 5 (B)). In contrastto oleanolic acid, exposure to 1025 M-INDO plus3 £ 1024 M-L-NAME did not result in a further alterationin relaxation induced by erythrodiol compared withINDO alone. Fig. 6 (B) shows that 1025 M-ICI 192,605was able to slightly but significantly (P,0·05) increaseFig. 2.

But, as shown inFig. 7, the relaxations due to oleanolic acid or erythrodiolwere not affected by the combination of these reactiveoxygen species scavengers.Effect of Ca2þ–ATPase inhibition on oleanolic acid anderythrodiol-induced relaxationsInhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2þ–ATPase with3 £ 1025 M-cyclopiazonic acid was able to significantlydecrease the relaxant effects of oleanolic acid and erythro-diol in aortic rings with endothelium (Fig. 8). On the otherhand, in endothelium-denuded arteries, the presence ofcyclopiazonic acid slightly increased the relaxationinduced by oleanolic acid or erythrodiol (Fig. 8).DiscussionThe present study investigates, for the first time, the vasore-laxant activity of oleanolic acid and erythrodiol in rat aorta.In the present experiments, we have studied the ability ofboth compounds, accumulatively added to the organ-bathmedium, to induce a relaxation of contractions caused bydifferent agonists, KCl or phenylephrine, in isolated rataorta. The results clearly show that oleanolic acid and ery-throdiol are able to relax, in a concentration-dependentfashion, the contractions induced by phenylephrine in rataortic rings with functional endothelium.

It is has been reportedthat high Kþ concentrations cause contractions in vascularsmooth muscle by depolarising cell membranes and byincreasing the influx of Ca2þ through long-lasting voltage-dependent channels (Godfraind et al. 1986). In this way,the absence of relaxation in 80 mM-KCl-evoked contractionsmight probably remove either the influence of membranehyperpolarisation or the contribution of the blockage of Caentry through voltage-stimulated Ca2þ channels to the relax-ant responses to oleanolic acid and erythrodiol.The vascular endothelium has been shown by Furchgott& Zawadzki (1980) to be of crucial importance in therelaxation of blood vessels in response to acetylcholineand some other naturally occurring vasodilator substances(Furchgott & Vanhoutte, 1989). Although NO appears tobe the major vasodilator released by endothelial cells,other substances may also play a role, including prostacy-clin and the endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor.These endothelial-relaxing factors contribute to the protec-tive role of the endothelium (Boulanger, 1999). It hasbecome clear that endothelial cells not only release relax-ing factors but also produce contracting substances suchas endothelin, thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2(Moncada et al. 1991) as well as reactive oxygen species(Lüscher & Barton, 1997). The present in vitro studyshows that the absence of the endothelial layer significantlyattenuates the relaxant effects of oleanolic acid and ery-throdiol. This indicates that these effects are due to anindirect and/or direct action of both triterpenic compoundson the vascular endothelium, increasing the release ofendogenous relaxing factors and/or inhibiting the pro-duction of contracting factors derived from endothelium.It has been previously reported in a well-established invitro model of vasomotion that triterpenoid-related com-pounds, commonly found in plant species, elicit vasore-laxation through the direct release of NO from vascularendothelium (Kim et al. 1994; Tanner et al. 1999). Inthis way, it was expected that oleanolic acid and erythro-diol would have vasoactive effects related to NO derivedfrom endothelium. The present experiments have indeeddemonstrated an NO-mediated mechanism, since the endo-thelium-dependent relaxation due to oleanolic acid or ery-throdiol was blocked by pre-incubating the arteries withthe NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. However, we cannotrule out the participation of other mechanisms of actionin the vasorelaxant activity.According to the relaxant effect of erythrodiol, NO didnot seem to be the only endothelial factor released bythis triterpenic alcohol addition. This conclusion is sup-ported by the results obtained with the COX inhibitor andwith the Tp receptor antagonist. It is important to pointout that erythrodiol induced a persisting relaxation in thepresence of the simultaneous blockage of the NO releaseand the COX pathway. In addition, a higher relaxationwas observed in the presence of the Tp receptor antagonist.The relaxant effect induced by erythrodiol was moreemphatic in the absence of thromboxane A2–prostaglandinH2 or Tp receptor action. The data reveal the possible par-ticipation of these endothelial vasoconstrictor productsupon erythrodiol stimulation. The most likely candidatefor the endothelial vasoconstrictor factor from COX isprobably thromboxane A2 or other prostanoids acting onthe Tp receptor (Yang et al. 2002); however, further studiesare needed to support this proposed mechanism. Theseresults have not been observed for oleanolic acid.The relationship between vascular endothelium andoxygen-derived free radicals is known (Mombouli &Vanhoutte, 1999; Vanhoutte, 2001). Superoxide anions areknown to be implicated in the breakdown of NO (Laightet al. 1998). Moreover, superoxide anions are the source ofthe secondary reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 andhydroxyl radicals (Yang et al. 2002). Therefore, one of ourhypotheses was that oleanolic acid and erythrodiol may med-iate their vascular effects via the protection of NO break-down by superoxide anions, since these triterpenoids,mainly oleanolic acid, have shown an antioxidant activity(Somova et al. 2003a,b). In our experimental conditions,the use of the superoxide anion and H2O2 scavengers, SODand catalase, did not modify the relaxations caused by olea-nolic acid and erythrodiol. Thus, these results ruled out amechanism sensitive to exogenous SOD and catalase eventhough a participation of intracellular reactive oxygenspecies insensitive to these scavengers cannot be excluded.In order to clarify the mechanism of relaxation, we havealso considered the involvement of intracellular Ca2þFig. 8.

For this purpose, we have used cyclo-piazonic acid, which is a specific inhibitor of the sarcoplas-mic reticulum Ca2þ–ATPase. The endothelium-dependentrelaxation induced by oleanolic acid and erythrodiol wassignificantly reduced by incubating the aortic rings withcyclopiazonic acid. In blood vessels, Ca2þ release andthe subsequent increase in cytosolic Ca2þ concentrationin endothelial cells could activate NO synthase andinduce the NO-mediated relaxation of aortic rings(Lückhoff et al. 1988; Zheng et al. 1994). These datasuggest that the effects of these triterpenoids on the Ca2þhomeostasis of endothelial cells might contribute to vasodi-latation. Therefore, oleanolic acid and erythrodiol mightinhibit the sequestration of Ca2þ into intracellular storesvia sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2þ–ATPase, thus increasingintracellular Ca2þ in endothelial cells, and with the sub-sequent NO synthase activation and NO release.In conclusion, the results of the present study introducethe first in vitro evidence that oleanolic acid and erythro-diol evoke an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation inrat aorta. These preliminary results suggest that the mech-anism of relaxation seems to be mainly mediated by theendothelial production of NO; however, other mechanismscannot be excluded. Bearing in mind the pharmacologicaleffects showed earlier, it can be concluded that oleanolicacid and erythrodiol may have interesting therapeuticpotential as new vasodilator drugs, thus protecting the car-diovascular system. Therefore, the intake of ‘orujo’ oliveoil, as a source of these compounds, might be beneficialin this regard. Additional experimentation is in progressin order to provide new data for clarifying the precisemechanism by which oleanolic acid and erythrodiol pro-duce their characteristic in vitro vasorelaxant effects.AcknowledgementsThe present study was supported by funds from the Comi-sión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnologı́a (CICYT)(project AGL2002-00195) and Junta de Andalucı́a(CAO01-002).ReferencesÁlvarez de Sotomayor M, Pérez-Guerrero C, Herrera MD &Marhuenda E (2001) Effect of simvastatin on vascularsmooth muscle responsiveness: involvement of Ca(2 þ )homeostasis.
