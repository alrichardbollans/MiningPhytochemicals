Previous studies have shown that coffee beans areconsisted of caffeine, chlorogenic acids, saccharides [3–5],as well as diterpenoids, although, taking a minor propor-tion in the chemical constituents of coffee. However, due totheir broad spectrum of biological activities, such ascytotoxicity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, researchershave carried out work on diterpenoids components fromElectronic supplementary material The online version of thisarticle (doi:10.1007/s13659-016-0099-1) contains supplementarymaterial, which is available to authorized users.R.

Along with the plantingscale expanded to 120 thousand hectares, Yunnan provincebecame a well-known cultivation base of C. arabica in theworld. In order to investigate the chemical constituents ofYunnan Arabica Coffee and find bioactivity diterpenoids,we took Yunnan Arabica Coffee green beans collected inDehong as the subject, and discovered five new ent-kau-rane diterpenoids, along with seven known diterpenoids(Fig. 1). Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, andtheir relevant bioactivities were also described.2 Results and DiscussionMascaroside III (1) was isolated as a white amorphous pow-der. The molecular formula C36H44O13 was deduced from themolecular ion peak at m/z [M ? Na]? 707.2670 (calcd forC36H44O13Na, 707.2674) in HREIMS. The IR spectrumindicated that 1 possessed hydroxyl (3440 cm-1) and a,b-unsaturated ketone (1650 cm-1) groups. The 13C NMR(DEPT) data (Tables 2, 3) showed 36 carbon resonances,attributed to a monosaccharide, a cinnamic acids group and anaglycone moiety, and the aglycone moiety were classified asone methyl (dC 15.7), 7 methylenes (including oneOOOO2122233 5HHOHHOO212223HO23451016789 14131211O19 18O201516HHOC1"O2"3"4"5"6"7" 8"9"HOOH1 R=A2 R=BHOOC1"O2"3"4"5"6"7" 8"9"O11"O10"A B17O10"HO20OOHHO OOHHOOOHHOOHOHOHOHOHOHHOHOHOHOR2OOHR110 R1 = α - COOH R2 = H11 R1 = β - COOH R2 = H12 R1 = β - COOH R2 = GlcHHOHOHO6 7 89HH2023 51016789131211151617OHOHO44141819OH20O1'O2'3'4'5'HOOHOH6' ORFig. 1 Structures of compounds 1–12218 R. Chu et al.123oxygenated), 6 methines (including one oxygenated, twoolefinic), and 6 quaternary carbons (including one oxy-genated, two olefinic, and one carbonyl). These data(Tables 1, 2, 3) were similar to those of mascaroside I [10, 11]except for 10 additional signals for a cinnamic acids group.The coupling constant (J200, 300 = 15.9 Hz) suggested thedouble bond of the cinnamic acid group was trans. Besides,dH6.80(d, J = 8.2 Hz), 7.10(d, J = 8.2 Hz) were due to ortho-aromatic hydrogen suggested the two oxygenated sp2 qua-ternary carbons were at C-600 and C-700, along with CH3-1000linked to OH-700 confirmed by the HMBC correlations fromH3-1000 (dH 3.88) to C-700. Further, the OH-60 in the glucoseand COOH-100 in trans-cinnamic acids group formed into esterwere confirmed by HMBC correlations of H-60 (dH 4.29, 4.69)to C-100 (dC 169.5). The relative configuration of glucoseanomeric proton was confirmed as b on the basis of the cou-pling constant (J10, 20 = 7.8 Hz). Furthermore, the glucosewas identified as D-form by GC analysis comparing with astandard after acid hydrolysis [12, 13]. The relative configu-ration of 1 was same with mascaroside I by comparison of theNMR data. Furthermore, owing to the greatly predominantoccurrence of this enantiomeric form in nature world, anduntil now, all the kaurene skeleton diterpenoids have beenisolated from Coffea arabica were ent-kaurene series.Therefore, compound 1 was confirmed as an ent-kauranoidwith the negative specific rotation value (-126.67) confirmedit further. ent-Kauranoid with the configuration of C-20 beinga-orientated and H-5, H-9 being b-orientated. The keyROESY correlations of H-11 (dH 3.86)/H-20 (dH 0.78), andH-5 (dH 2.83)/H-9 (dH 1.61), H-9/H-15b (dH 2.12), and H-15b/H2-17 (dH 3.59, 4.71) allowed to assign H-11 as a-orientated,and CH2OH-17 as b-orientated, separately [14]. Hence, thestructure of 1 was determined and named as mascaroside III(Fig. 2).Mascaroside IV (2) had the molecular formula ofC37H46O14 according to the HRESIMS analysis at m/zTable 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1–5 [d in ppm, J in Hz]Position 1a 2a 3b 4a 5b1 2.39 (d, 16.3) 2.42 (d, 16.3) 2.33 (d, 16.1) 1.28 (dd, 13.6, 4.4) 0.94 (m)2.74 (d, 16.3) 2.77 (d, 16.3) 2.83 (d, 16.1) 1.81 (m) 2.01 (dd, 14.8, 5.9)2 – – – 1.19 (m) 1.52 (m)– – – 1.72 (m) 1.64 (m)3 – – – 1.58 (m) 1.01 (m)– – – 1.65 (m) 2.10 (m)5 2.83 (br d, 14.2) 2.85 (br d, 12.6) 2.77 (dd, 12.4, 2.4) 1.94 (dd, 14.0, 4.8) 1.53 (m)6 1.61 (m) 1.63 (m) 1.62 (m) 1.57 (m) 1.84 (m)2.01 (m) 2.03 (m) 1.99 (m) 1.86 (m) 1.89 (m)7 1.72 (m) 1.73 (m) 1.78 (m, 2H) 1.77 (m) 1.64 (m)2.04 (m) 2.06 (m) 1.90 (m) 2.22 (d, 12.1)9 1.61 (m) 1.63 (m) 1.61 (m) – –11 3.86 (m) 3.89 (m) 3.93 (m) 1.72 (m) 1.44 (m)– – – 2.20 (dd, 13.8, 5.8) 1.75 (m)12 1.72 (m) 1.73 (m) 1.81 (m) 1.61 (m) 1.45 (m)1.78 (m) 1.78 (m) 1.95 (m) 1.63 (m) 1.51 (m)13 2.10 (m) 2.13 (m) 2.15 (m) 1.90 (m) 2.11 (m)14 1.74 (m) 1.73 (m) 1.57 (m) 1.77 (m) 1.50 (m)1.77 (m) 1.76 (m) 1.85 (m) 1.91 (m) 1.65 (m)15 1.37 (d, 14.3) 1.40 (d, 14.4) 1.85 (m) 1.39 (d, 14.7) 1.53 (m)2.12 (m) 2.15 (d, 14.4) 2.40 (m) 2.02 (d, 14.7) 2.44 (d, 15.0)17 3.59 (d, 10.2) 3.53 (d, 10.2) 4.10 (d, 9.3) 3.64 (d, 11.5) 3.89 (d, 8.6)4.71 (d, 10.2) 4.74 (d, 10.2) 4.27 (d, 9.3) 3.70 (d, 11.5) 4.04 (d, 8.6)18 6.58 (s) 6.61 (s) 6.42 (d, 1.4) 1.06 (s) 1.23 (s)19 7.78 (s) 7.81 (s) 7.60 (d, 1.4) – –20 0.78 (s) 0.81 (s) 0.87 (s) 1.16 (s) 1.08 (s)22 – – 1.37 (s) – 1.39 (s)23 – – 1.36 (s) – 1.36 (s)a Data were measured at 600 MHz in CD3ODb Data were measured at 600 MHz in CDCl3Characterization of New Ent-kaurane Diterpenoids of Yunnan Arabica Coffee Beans 219123[M ? Na]? 737.2786 (calcd for C37H46O14Na, 737.2780).The 1D NMR data (Tables 1, 2, 3) of 2 was identical to thatof 1, except that the cinnamic acids group in 2 was sub-stituted by one more oxygenated methyl, which was furtherverified by the HMBC correlations from H-1000, andH-1100 (dH 3.89) to C-600, and C-800 (dC 149.5). The chiralcenters of 2 were same with those of compound 1.Therefore, the structure of 2 was elucidated as shown andgiven the name mascaroside IV.Mascaroside V (3) was isolated as white powder. TheHRESIMS of 3 showed an ion peak at m/z [M ? Na]?409.1987 (calcd for 409.1985) suggesting a molecularformula C23H30O5. The 1D NMR spectroscopic featuresshowed it similar to the aglycone moiety of 1 with thedifferences being that three more carbon atoms (dC 108.1 s,26.8 q, 26.6 q). HSQC together with HMBC spectral sig-nals, showed that CH3-22 (dC 26.8), CH3-23 (dC 26.6) werelocated at the same sp3 quaternary carbon (C-21 dC108.1 s) which was confirmed by correlations fromH-22, H-23 to C-21. This three carbons group was substi-tuted at 16-OH, 17-OH to form a ketal ring [15] based onHMBC correlations from H2-17 (dH 4.10, 4.27) toC-21.The ROESY correlations were similar to compound1, consequently, the structure of 3 was confirmed as mas-caroside V.20-nor-cofaryloside I (4) a white amorphous powder,displayed a [M ? Na]? 357.2032 (calcd for 357.2036) inHREIMS, consistent with the molecular formula ofC20H30O4, indicating 6 degrees of unsaturation. The com-pound 4 displayed similar characteristic signals to10a,16a,17-trihydroxy-9a-methyl-15-oxo-20-nor-kauran-Table 2 13C NMR spectral data of compounds 1–5 [d in ppm]Position 1a 2a 3b 4a 5b1 54.3 (t) 54.3 (t) 53.4 (t) 31.8 (t) 29.7 (t)2 187.7 (s) 187.6 (s) 185.2 (s) 19.8 (t) 28.1 (t)3 148.0 (s) 147.9 (s) 146.6 (s) 35.8 (t) 37.6 (t)4 144.8 (s) 144.8 (s) 142.1 (s) 50.1 (s) 49.5 (s)5 45.8 (d) 45.8 (d) 44.8 (d) 52.2 (d) 50.1 (d)6 23.4 (t) 23.3 (t) 22.4 (t) 21.6 (t) 21.8 (t)7 37.1 (t) 37.0 (t) 39.6 (t) 41.4 (t) 39.3 (t)8 45.2 (s) 45.2 (s) 42.3 (s) 43.5 (s) 43.8 (s)9 62.1 (d) 62.1 (d) 61.0 (d) 45.9 (s) 43.8 (s)10 43.8 (s) 43.8 (s) 43.9 (s) 90.6 (s) 77.1 (s)11 66.1 (d) 66.1 (d) 65.2 (d) 34.4 (t) 36.2 (t)12 37.5 (t) 37.5 (t) 36.7 (t) 24.9 (t) 19.0 (t)13 46.5 (d) 46.5(d) 44.7 (d) 44.8 (d) 44.2 (d)14 41.3 (t) 41.2 (t) 38.0 (t) 33.5 (t) 32.3 (t)15 52.0 (t) 52.0 (t) 55.1 (t) 50.9 (t) 50.2 (t)16 82.4 (s) 82.3 (s) 89.3 (s) 84.9 (s) 89.2 (s)17 75.4 (t) 75.4 (t) 70.5 (t) 66.2 (t) 69.7 (t)18 111.4 (d) 111.4 (d) 110.0 (d) 17.5 (q) 29.1 (q)19 150.4 (d) 150.4 (d) 148.2 (d) 183.0 (s) 183.2 (s)20 15.7 (q) 15.7 (q) 15.3 (q) 19.3 (q) 17.5 (q)21 – – 108.1 (s) – 104.2 (s)22 – – 26.8 (q) – 26.9 (q)23 – – 26.6 (q) – 26.8 (q)a Data were measured at 150 MHz in CD3ODb Data were measured at 150 MHz in CDCl3Table 3 1H NMR and 13C NMR of the glucose and cinnamic acidsgroup [d in ppm, J in Hz]1H NMR 13C NMR1 2 1 210 4.32 (d, 7.8) 4.34 (d, 7.5) 104.8 (d) 104.8 (d)20 3.22 (m) 3.26 (t, 8.3) 75.4 (d) 75.4 (d)30 3.40 (m) 3.43 (m) 77.6 (d) 77.6 (d)40 3.40 (m) 3.43 (m) 71.5 (d) 71.5 (d)50 3.50 (m) 3.61 (d, 10.1) 75.5 (d) 75.5 (d)60 4.29 (m) 4.32 (d, 4.7) 63.9 (t) 63.8 (t)4.69 (m) 4.73 (m) – –100 – – 169.5 (s) 169.5 (s)200 6.42 (d, 15.9) 6.49 (d, 15.9) 115.2 (d) 115.7 (d)300 7.65 (d, 15.9) 7.67 (d, 15.9) 147.4 (d) 147.6 (d)400 – – 127.6 (s) 126.9 (s)500 7.20 (s) 6.95 (s) 111.8 (d) 107.0 (d)600 – – 150.8 (s) 149.5 (s)700 – – 149.4 (s) 139.8 (s)800 6.80 (d, 8.2) – 116.5 (d) 149.5 (s)900 7.10 (d, 8.2) 6.95 (s) 124.3 (d) 107.0 (d)1000 3.88 (s) 3.89 (s) 56.5 (q) 56.9 (q)1100 – 3.89 (s) – 56.9 (q)dH Data were measured at 600 MHz in CD3ODdC Data were measured at 150 MHz in CD3ODOOHHOOHOOOOHMe1H -1H COSY H C HMBC H H ROESYOHOOHOHO341256 710O1918OMe20119814 131215HHHH OHHHO OHOOHOHOROHHHHHFig. 2 Key correlations in 2D NMR spectra of compound 1220 R. Chu et al.12319-oic acid c-lactone (A) [16, 17] except for the absence ofthe carbonyl groups at C-15. This was confirmed by thechemical shift at C-15 (dC 50.9) in 4 which was upfieldshifted comparing to that in A (dC 224.0). Besides, theHMBC correlations from H2-15 (dH 1.39, 2.02) to C-16 (dC84.9) and C8 (dC 43.5) also supported these change. Onbiogenetic grounds, compound 4 as an ent-kaurane with theconfiguration of H-5 and H-9 being b-orientated, whileOH-10 being a-orientated. Its ROESY correlations showedcross peaks of H-5 (dH 1.94)/Me-18 (dH 1.06), H-5/Me-20(dH 1.16), Me-20/H-15b (dH 2.02), H-15b/H2-17 (dH 3.64,3.70), revealing that the orientation of C-18, C-20 and C-17was b-orientated (Fig. 3). Thereupon, the structure of 4was identified as 10a,16a,17-trihydroxy-9b-methyl-20-nor-ent-kauran-19-oic acid c-lactone, and named 20-nor-co-faryloside I.20-nor-cofaryloside II (5) possessed the molecular for-mula of C23H36O5, according to the HRESIMS analysis atm/z [M - H]- 391.2488 (calcd for 391.2490). Analyses of50s 1H and 13C NMR data indicated the existence of 23carbon resonances, and C-21 (dC 104.2 s), C-22 (dC 26.9 q)and C-23 (dC 26.9 q) suggesting that the structure of com-pound 5 had the same ketal ring as compound 3 and thisdeduction was further supported by HMBC correlationsfrom H2-17, H3-22 and H3-23 to C-21. The other 20 carbonsignals showed that compound 5 was similar to 4 while thechemical shift of the oxygenated sp3 quaternary carbon C-10(dC 77.1) of 5 was upfield shifted comparing to that of 4 (dC90.6), and the molecular weight of 5 was 18 units more thanthat of 4 along with the degrees of unsaturation decrease byone. Therefore, the lactone linkage which assigned betweenCOOH-19 and OH-10 was ring opened in 5. The relativeconfiguration of 5 (Fig. 4) was same with 4. Thus, thestructure was defined as 10a-hydroxy- 16a,17-[(1-methylethylidene)bis(oxy)]-9b-methyl-20-nor-ent-kauran-19-oic acid, and named 20-nor- cofaryloside II.Seven known diterpenoids were also obtained from thisgenus, bengalensol [18], villanovane [10], tricalysione A [14],2b,16a,17-trihydroxy-ent-kauran-19a-oic acid [19], 2-O-(2-O-isovaleryl-b- D-gluco-pyranosyl)-4a-atractyligenin [20],2-O-(2-O-isovaleryl-b-D-gluco-pyranosyl)-4b-atrac- tyligenin[20], 3-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-2-O-(2-O-isovaleryl-b-D-gluco-pyranosyl)-4b-atracty ligenin [20]. Their structureswere identified by comparison of their NMR data with litera-ture data.Compounds 1–5, 7, 8 were evaluated for cytotoxicityagainst HL-60, A-549, SMMC-7721, MCF-7 and SW480cell lines. Unfortunately, they were inactive against all testcells (Electronic supplementary material, Table S1).3 Experimental Section3.1 General Experimental Procedures1D and 2D NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Karlsruhe,Germany). HREIMS was measured on Waters Xevo TQ-S andWaters Autospec Premier P776 mass spectrometers (Waters,Milford, MA, USA). HRESIMS were recorded on an Agilent6200 Q-TOF MS system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,CA, USA). UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Optical rotations wereobtained on a JASCO P-1020 digital polarimeter (Horiba,Kyoto, Japan). IR spectra were detected on Bruker Tensor 27FTIR (KBr pellets) spectrometers. Sephadex LH-20 (Amer-sham Biosciences, Upssala, Sweden) and silica gel (QingdaoHaiyang Chemical Co., Ltd) were used for column chro-matography (CC). Preparative high performance liquid chro-matography (prep-HPLC) was performed on an Agilent 1100liquid chromatography system equipped with Zorbax SB-C18columns (9.4 mm 9 250 mm) and a DAD detector (AgilentTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Thin-layer chromatog-raphy was performed on precoated TLC plates (200–250 lmthickness, silica gel 60 F254, Qingdao Marine Chemical, Inc.),and spots were visualized by heating after spraying.3.2 Plant MaterialThe green coffee beans of Coffea arabica L. were har-vested in December 2014 and identified by Hong-boZhang, Dehong Institute of Tropical Agriculture. A vou-cher specimen of C. arabica was deposited in the Her-barium of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academyof Sciences (No. KCF 201412).OHOHOMeMe1H -1H COSY H C HMBC H H ROESY341256 710 119814 13121516HHMe20HHMe1819 OO OH17OHH HOHHFig. 3 Key correlations in 2D NMR spectra of compound 4OOOMeMe1H -1H COSY H C HMBC H H ROESYOHOHMeMe341256 710 119814 13121516HHMe20HMe1819 OHOO17OH HH HOH 21Me 22Me 23Fig. 4 Key correlations in 2D NMR spectra of compound 5Characterization of New Ent-kaurane Diterpenoids of Yunnan Arabica Coffee Beans 2211233.3 Extraction and IsolationThe air-dried and powdered green Dehong coffee beans(18 kg) were extracted with 95 % methanol three times,and then the combined filtrates were concentrated underreduced pressure to give a crude extract (5 kg). The crudeextract was suspended in H2O and extracted with petro-leum ether (PE), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), respectively. TheEtOAc layer (160 g) was got rid of saccharides by D101and then subjected to RP-18 column chromatographywhich eluted with MeOH–H2O (gradient from 15:85 to100:0 v/v) to yield four fractions: fraction 1 (20 g), fraction2 (19 g), fraction 3 (30 g), and fraction 4 (24 g). Fraction 4was separated on silica gel CC using a CHCl3–MeOHgradient solvent system (80:0 ? 1:1, v/v) to obtain eightsubfractions (fraction 4–1 to 4–8). Then fraction 4–6(6.5 g) was chromatographed on RP-18 CC (MeOH–H2O10:90–100:0 v/v), Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) and thenpurified by semipreparative HPLC (elute with CH3CN–H2O 15–75 %, 30 min) to afford 1 (5 mg), 2 (7 mg), 10(2 mg), 11 (8 mg), 12 (40 mg).
