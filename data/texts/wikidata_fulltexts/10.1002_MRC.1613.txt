The trapping efficiency of scopoletin (1), themajor extract constituent, was much higher on a GP (general phase, a polystyrene-type polymer) SPE phasethan on a C18 phase. Thus, under the conditions used, up to 100 µg of scopoletin per cartridge could beaccumulated linearly after repeated trappings. The maximum achievable NMR signal-to-noise ratio usingthe GP cartridges was at least four times higher than that achievable with the C18 cartridges. It was shownthat excessively long T1 relaxation times may compromise experiments in which acetonitrile-d3 is usedas the cartridge eluent. Nevertheless, the sensitivity gain provided by the HPLC–SPE–NMR techniquethrough repeated peak trappings allowed the acquisition of good-quality proton-detected 2D NMR spectrawithout the need for solvent suppression.

Notinfrequently, time and effort are spent on the isolation ofalready well-known or otherwise trivial chemical entities,slowing progress in the generation of potentially usefulstructures. It is therefore of great importance to be able to gaininformation about extract constituents before investment inthe preparative isolation process.Among various spectroscopic methods, only NMR spec-troscopy is capable of providing the full information nor-mally needed for rigorous structure determination of anatural product, including determination of its relative stere-ochemistry and discrimination between positional isomers.In order to exploit the power of NMR, a full repertoireof homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D experiments mustbe available. Although valuable information about con-stituents present can be obtained by high-field NMR studies†Presented as part of a special issue on Hyphenated NMRTechniques.ŁCorrespondence to: Jerzy W.

Therefore, full assignment of the NMR spectra of natu-ral products, and especially structure determination of minorconstituents, will usually require NMR data acquired withpure compounds. For that reason, HPLC–NMR hyphenationis potentially an extremely important technique in naturalproducts research.7 – 9However, in order to fulfil the promise it holds,HPLC–NMR has to be developed into a robust technologynot suffering from its current limitations. Traditionally,HPLC–NMR data are acquired in on-flow mode, stopped-flow mode, time-sliced stopped-flow mode or loop-storagemode.10 – 12 Although the stopped-flow mode circumventsto some extent sensitivity problems inherent to the NMRtechnique, it creates diffusion-mediated peak broadeningon the HPLC column during chromatographic runs. Loopstorage alleviates the latter problem, but sensitivity of theNMR data acquisition is still determined by HPLC. Henceit is necessary to acquire NMR spectra at the analyteconcentrations delivered in the HPLC band and in the solventused for HPLC. Deuterated solvents are frequently used inthe mobile phases for chromatographic separations, whichis feasible only with certain solvents owing to excessive cost.Usually, the HPLC peak elution volumes are larger than thesensitive volume of the NMR flow cell, hence a considerablefraction of material eluted from the HPLC column does notCopyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.772 M. Lambert et al.contribute to the NMR signal. The use of higher columnloadings helps only as far as it results in higher analyteconcentrations and not merely in larger elution bands.So far, the most promising solution to the above problemsis the introduction of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) interfacebetween HPLC and NMR, resulting in the novel hyphenatedtechnique HPLC–SPE–NMR.13,14 This technique (1) permitssolvent change between HPLC and NMR, (2) concentratesthe whole HPLC elution volume of the peak in the NMRflow cell and (3) provides further sensitivity gains throughrepeated SPE steps. In this paper, we present the applicationof this novel technique to studies of extracts of root bark ofCroton membranaceus Mu¨ll. Arg. Alcoholic extracts of rootsof this plant are used in Ghana for the treatment of prostatichypertrophy.15,16 C. membranaceus was recently shown tocontain a novel imide alkaloid named julocrotine,17 which isthe only literature report on the chemistry of this species.RESULTSPowdered root-bark of C. membranaceus was extracted withethanol at ambient temperature and the extracts wereinvestigated by reversed-phase HPLC on a 150 ð 4.6 mm i.d.octadecylsilylsilica column using an acetonitrile gradient inwater. The chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1. The extractis dominated by one constituent eluted at a retentiontime tR D 14.3 min. The identity of this constituent wasdetermined by an HPLC–SPE–NMR experiment, in which1.1 mg of the crude extract was injected on to the column,trapping the peak at tR D 14.3 min once after post-columndilution of the eluate with water in the ratio 4 : 5. Thisresulted in a 600 MHz 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2) with asignal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 287 in the region υ 3.0–8.0(128 transients). The S/N ratio was improved by multipletrappings and good-quality spectra could be obtainedeven without suppression of residual solvent resonances;with 10 trappings, excellent quality NOESY,18 gHSQC19and gHMBC20 spectra were obtained (Fig. 3), allowing theunambiguous identification of the major extract constituentas scopoletin (1). The NOESY spectrum showed correlationsbetween H-4 and H-5 and between H-5 and OCH3, providingdistinction from the positional isomer isoscopoletin (2). Theassignment was corroborated by HMBC correlations (Fig. 3).The total amount of 1 in the plant extract was 0.004% dryweight as determined from a calibration curve.The effectiveness of SPE trapping of scopoletin wasinvestigated on two different SPE stationary phases, SparkHySphere C18 HD phase (octadecylsilylsilica) and HySphereResin GP phase (reversed-phase sorbent of polystyrene type),measuring the S/N ratio in 600 MHz 1H NMR spectraobtained in the HPLC–SPE–NMR mode after repeatedinjections of solutions of 1 (Fig. 4).

The T1 relaxation times in CD3CNwere generally much longer than those in CDCl3. The relax-ation times measured in the HPLC–SPE–NMR mode wereclosely similar to those measured with CD3CN in NMR tubesin the presence of oxygen (Table 1). The knowledge of relax-ation times led to improved efficiency of data accumulationwithout distortion of the integrals due to selective saturationof the resonances.SPE trappings of the remaining peaks in the chro-matogram (Fig. 1) with tR < 17 min failed to produce any1H NMR spectra.

Moreover, the residual solventresonances are present in the high-field section of the spectralrange, and therefore solvent peak suppression does not affectthe most interesting regions of the spectra. However, sinceacetonitrile only weakly solvates the solute molecules, thecorrelation times of small molecules are short, resulting infairly long T1 relaxation times (Table 1). This decreases theefficiency of data accumulation, in particular with pulsesequences employing 90° pulse as the read pulse. Hence, thelong T1 relaxation times observed in acetonitrile have to betaken into account in the experimental setup. Moreover, sincethe bulk of NMR data for natural products described in theliterature is reported in other solvents, typically CDCl3 [orCD3OD, CD32SO or D2O for more polar compounds], useof CD3CN makes chemical shift comparisons less efficient.The present experiments demonstrate that 1, the polarityof which is representative for many natural products,is effectively trapped in HPLC–SPE–NMR experiments,leading to considerable improvement in the S/N ratio. Henceall standard proton-detected 2D experiments are readilyCopyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2005; 43: 771–775774 M. Lambert et al.Figure 4.

For example,the distinction between 1 and 2, which have closely similarUV spectra, ESI mass spectra and 1H NMR chemical shifts,is possible only by use of NOESY or HMBC data. Thisexample demonstrates the power of the HPLC–SPE–NMRtechnique. The fact that multiple trappings can readilyachieve large amounts of the analyte is also significantbecause the suppression of the residual solvent resonancesmay be unnecessary. This removes problems with distortionof resonances close to the suppressed peaks and gives spectrawith correct integrals in the optimal total data acquisitiontime.During repeated SPE trappings, the amount of materialon the cartridge increases whereas the concentration of theanalyte in the peak elution band remains the same. Fora particular SPE partition coefficient, this may eventuallylead to apparent saturation of the cartridge, after which theadditional trappings do not lead to increased accumulation,or even to a loss of the material from the cartridge.The ratio of post-column water dilution and choice ofthe SPE material may be crucial for the success of theexperiment. The ratio of post-column water dilution chosenwill always be a compromise between the expected trappingefficiency, a danger of analyte precipitation and back-pressure development in the system. The importance ofthe SPE material is illustrated by a comparison betweenC18 HD phase and GP phase, shown in Fig. 4. Whereasthe latter phase allows a linear improvement in S/N ratioafter repeated trappings of up to ¾100 µg of 1 per cartridge,trapping on the C18 HD phase becomes inefficient above20 µg per cartridge (Fig. 4). Hence the maximum S/N ratioachieved after repeated trappings on the C18 HD phase wasonly one-quarter of what could be achieved with the GPphase. Although the actual situation will be different fromcompound to compound and will be affected by the ratio ofpost-column dilution with water, the superiority of the GPmaterial in the present case is clearly demonstrated.In conclusion, the use of the SPE interface in HPLC–NMRexperiments provides a sensitivity improvement at leastequal to that achievable with cryogenic probes.21 Becausethe sensitivity gain is due to the actual increase of theamount of the analyte relative to the amount of the solventpresent, an additional flexibility with respect to experimentalsetup is provided. A possible disadvantage of the method ispotential degradation of the analyte on SPE cartridges; thisis minimized by storage of the loaded cartridges in an inertatmosphere (under nitrogen).EXPERIMENTALInstrumentationHPLC separations were performed at 40 °C on a chromato-graph consisting of a Shimadzu SCL-10A system controller,SIL-10AD autoinjector, LC-10AT pump and SPD-M10Adiode-array detector using a 150 ð 4.6 mm i.d., 3 µm particlesize Luna C18(2) column. The system was controlled withShimadzu Class-VP version 6.10 software.

The cartridges were preconditioned with500 µl of acetonitrile at 10 ml min1 and equilibrated with500 µl of water at 1 ml min1 prior to the trapping. After sin-gle or multiple trappings the cartridge was dried for 30 minat ambient temperature with a stream of nitrogen, and thetrapped material was eluted with ¾30 µl of acetonitrile-d3(99.8 at.% of deuterium) and transferred to a 30 µl NMR flowprobe. The total amount of acetonitrile-d3 used for the elutionand transfer was 282 µl at a transfer rate of 240 µl min1; theanalyte transfer conditions were determined experimentallyusing a reference sample.NMR data were acquired on a Bruker Avance 600 spec-trometer (proton frequency 600.13 MHz) equipped witheither a 30 µl inverse 1Hf13Cg flow probe or a 5 mmTXI probe.

Avoucher specimen (GC39040) was deposited in HerbariumGC (Ghana Herbarium, Botany Department, University ofGhana, Legon).Sample preparationDried root-bark of C. membranaceus (2 g) was extractedovernight with 96% ethanol (60 ml) at ambient temperaturewith occasional sonification. The mixture was filteredand the extract evaporated to dryness to yield 43 mgof a residue. Solutions for HPLC and HPLC–SPE–NMRanalysis were prepared by making 55 mg ml1 solutionsof crude extracts in 1 : 1 acetonitrile–water. A 1 mg ml1solution of authentic scopoletin (Sigma) was prepared in 1 : 1acetonitrile–water.NMR experiments1D 1H NMR spectra were obtained either without solventsuppression or with solvent suppression of residual waterand acetonitrile signals using a 1D NOESY with doublepresaturation. In most cases, 128 transients were obtained,collecting 64K data points with a sweep width of 20 ppm.2D experiments were performed using standard Brukerlibrary pulse sequences for recording NOESY,18 gHSQC19and gHMBC20 experiments.
