The title compound, C20H22N2O2, an alkaloid isolated from the Madagascar
periwinkle, crystallizes in P1 with two independent but closely similar molecules
in the unit cell. The molecules are linked into pairs by two N—H  O C
hydrogen bonds. The absolute configuration was confirmed by anomalous
dispersion effects as S at the 3 and 15 positions, and R at the 7 position.
1. Chemical context
The Madagascar periwinkle or rosy periwinkle (Catharanthus
roseus L. G. Don), a member of the family Apocynaceae, is
one of the most intensively studied medicinal plants (Sotto-
mayor et al., 1998; Sreevalli et al., 2004). Aerial parts of the
plant contain between 0.2 and 1% of a mixture of more than
120 alkaloids (van Der Heijden et al., 2004). The most abun-
dant are the monomers such as catharanthine and vindoline
(Renault et al., 1999). The dimeric alkaloids that result from
the joining of two compounds can display interesting phar-
maceutical activities. Thus vinblastine and vincristine are used
in the chemotherapy of leukemia and in the treatment of
Hodgkin’s disease (Verma et al., 2007). Additionally, ajmali-
cine, a monomeric indole alkaloid present in the root of C.
roseus, is an antihypertensive alkaloid (Noble, 1990). In view
of their medical and commercial value, the appropriate
methods of extraction and purification have been well studied.
We have undertaken the X-ray crystal structure determi-
nation of the title compound in order to establish its absolute
stereochemistry. One-dimensional (1H, 13C, DEPT135) and
two-dimensional NMR (HSQC, HMBC, 1H/1H-COSY, 1H/1H-
NOESY) experiments clearly assigned the proton and carbon
resonances and are consistent with the constitution of
ISSN 2056-9890
akuammicine (Buckingham et al., 2010). As the final purifi-
cation step was performed with an alkaline solvent mixture,
the NMR data of akuammicine correspond to the free base,
and can be linked to the determined stereochemistry.
2. Structural commentary
The title compound crystallizes in space group P1 with two
independent molecules (Fig. 1). The two molecules are closely
similar; a least-squares fit of all non-H atoms gives an r.m.s.
deviation of 0.065 A˚, whereby the largest deviation is 0.29 A˚
for the methyl carbon C18. The absolute configuration is
established as S at C3 and C15 and R at C7. Intramolecular
classical N1—H01  O1 hydrogen bonds are observed
(Table 1). The C18—H18A  O2 contacts in both molecules
may represent a significant intramolecular interaction.
The five-membered ring involving N4 displays an envelope
conformation, with C5 lying outside the plane of the other
four atoms. The cyclohexene ring is a ‘skew-boat’ or 1,3-
diplanar form, with torsion angles of approximately zero
about C3—C7 and C2 C16. Finally, the six-membered ring
involving N4 shows a form intermediate between boat and
skew-boat; the torsion angle about C15—C20 is approximately
zero, but that about C3—N4 (which would also be zero for an
ideal boat) is about 24. See Table 2 for details.
3. Supramolecular features
The two molecules are connected by the two classical
hydrogen bonds, N1—H01  O10 and N10—H010  O1 (Fig. 1,
Table 1), to form a dimeric assembly. The contacts C11—
H11  Cg1(1 + x, 1 + y, z) and C110—H110  Cg2(1 + x,
1 + y, z), where Cg1 is the mid-point of C19 C20 and Cg2 is
the mid-point of C190 C200, may represent C—H   inter-
actions; the H  Cg distances are 2.74 and 2.72 A˚, and the
angles at H are 147 and 155, respectively.
4. Database survey
The most similar natural product to have been investigated by
X-ray structure analysis is probably isovoacangine (Soriano-
Garcı´a et al., 1991), refcode KORZOG.
5. Isolation and crystallization
The title compound was isolated using a combination of high-
performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) (Ito,
2005), preparative C18 high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy (HPLC) and silica-gel column chromatography (Ito,
2005). Seedlings of F1 Titan Rose Catharanthus roseus,
purchased from a commercial provider of pharmaceutical
plants (Ga¨rtnerei Volk GmbH Pflanzenhandel, Braunschweig,
Germany), were planted and grown outside from June to July
2015 on a mixture of standard garden soil and sand (2:1).
Aerial plant parts were harvested and lyophilized, and dried
tissue material was then milled by a bead mill [Mixer Mill MM
200 (RETSCH, Haan, Germany) at a vibrational frequency of
25 Hz for 1 min]. The dried powder was immersed in water
adjusted to pH 2 by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), homogenized
by a T-25 digital ULTRA-TURRAX (IKA, Staufen,
Germany) at maximum speed (25 000 rpm for 10 min) and
shaken overnight for extraction. Plant particles were centri-
fuged off (30 min, 8000 rpm). The acidic extract was lyophi-
lized and redissolved in 1 l chloroform. A solution of NaOH
was added (1 l, 200 mM) and the solutions were vigorously
mixed for alkaloid extraction. The phases were centrifuged
(8000 rpm, 15 min) and the chloroform phase was dried for
indole-alkaloid recovery.
The complex indole-alkaloid crude extract (700 mg) was
injected into a semi-preparative HPCCC instrument (Spec-
trum, Dynamic Extractions Ltd, Gwent, UK) (Ito, 2005), a
J-type centrifuge equipped with two coil bobbins (PTFE
tubing, ID 1.6 mm, column volume 125 ml) operated with the
biphasic solvent system water/n-hexane/n-butanol (2:1:1
v/v/v) using the ion-pair reagent TFA (5.0 ml l1). The rota-

tion velocity was set to 1600 rpm (240 g field), and the flow
rate of the aqueous mobile phase (5.0 ml min1) (head-to-tail
mode) resulted in a stationary phase retention of 60% after
system equilibration.
For metabolite profiling, aliquots of the recovered HPCCC
fractions were injected in sequence into an ESI-ion trap MS/
MS (HCT Ultra ETD II, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) in a standard protocol described by Jerz et al.
(2014) and the target alkaloid akuammicine was detected with
[M+H]+ at m/z 323 in fractions 61 to 69 (elution volume 304–
345 ml). The combined fractions were re-chromatographed by
preparative HPLC (Wellchrom K-1001, Knauer Gera¨tebau
Berlin, Germany) using a C18 column (Prontosil C18Aq, 25 
250 mm) and an isocratic flow rate of 4.5 ml min1 (aceto-
nitrile:water, 60:40 with 1% TFA). Alkaloids were monitored
using a UV detector (Wellchrom K-2600, Knauer Gera¨tebau,
Berlin, Germany) at  254, 280 and 300 nm.
The 10 mg amber-coloured HPLC fraction was finally
purified by SiO2 column chromatography (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) using ethyl acetate/n-hexane/ethanol/25% aqueous
ammonia (100/5/5/3) to yield pure akuammicine (1.2 mg),
detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (SiO2 60 F254,
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with this solvent system and
sprayed with Dragendorff reagent (RF value 0.25). LC–ESI–
MS, measured in the positive ionization mode using a Pron-
tosil C18-Aq column (250  2.0 mm, 5 mm, 100 A˚, Knauer
Gera¨tebau, Berlin, Germany), detected akuammicine, ESI–
MS/MS (pos) [M+H]+: m/z 323, MS/MS 291 (100%).
Akuammicine crystals grew in tube fractions during slow
evaporation of the solvents, and an appropriate colourless
crystal was chosen for X-ray analysis.

6. Refinement
Crystal data, data collection and structure refinement details
are summarized in Table 3. N-bound H atoms were refined
freely. Methyls were refined as idealized rigid groups, with C—
H = 0.98 A˚ and H—C—H = 109.5. Other H atoms were
included using a riding model starting from calculated posi-
tions, with aromatic C—H = 0.95 A˚, methylene C—H = 0.99 A˚
and methine C—H = 1.00 A˚, with Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(C) for
methyl H atoms and 1.2Ueq(C) for other H atoms. The Flack
parameter of 0.10 (13) is adequate to determine the absolute
configuration.

Special details 
Geometry. All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance 
matrix. The cell esds are taken into account individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles and torsion angles; 
correlations between esds in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate 
(isotropic) treatment of cell esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes.
