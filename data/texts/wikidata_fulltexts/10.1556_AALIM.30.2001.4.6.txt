Acta Alimentaria, Vol. 30 (4), pp. 373–380 (2001)IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OFSOME CAPSAICINOIDS IN PADRÓN PEPPER(CAPSICUM ANNUUM L. VAR. ANNUUM) FRUITSB. ESTRADA, M. A. BERNAL, F. POMAR and F. MERINO*Departamento de Bioloxía Animal, Bioloxía Vexetal e Ecoloxía, Facultade de Ciencias,Universidade da Coruña. A Zapateira s/n 15071 A Coruña. Spain(Received: 15 November 2000; accepted: 15 June 2001)Capsaicinoid and phenolic contents were determined at different maturation stages of thepepper fruit, with an increase being observed in the levels of both components. The increase intotal soluble phenolics probably reflects the accumulation of capsaicinoids seen throughoutdevelopment. Four different capsaicinoids and their precursor vanillylamine were identified in thecultivars studied. Capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin showed the sameaccumulation patterns in all stages, but homodihydrocapsaicin appeared only in the last stage.Keywords: pepper, Capsicum annum L, capsaicinoids, phenolics, HPLC determinationPhenolic compounds constitute one of the most important groups of naturalproducts, which possess an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxyl groups(HARBONE, 1980). Some phenolics, such as hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids, arefound in all the plant groups, but in very different quantities. However, other phenolicsare exclusive to a particular genus and species (SWAIN, 1979; MACHEIX et al., 1990).These compounds are present in all plant tissues and are often the most abundantsecondary metabolites in fruits, where they sometimes reach high concentrations.Phenolics are also important because of their contribution to the sensory quality offruits- color, astringency, bitterness, and flavor (MACHEIX et al., 1990). The levels ofphenolic compounds during growth and maturation vary strongly depending on theavailability of the precursors of phenolic molecules and the activity of the enzymesinvolved in the biosynthesis of these precursors in interconversions between phenolicmolecules or in their degradation (LUCKNER, 1980).There is a group of phenolic compounds characteristic of some fruits of the genusCapsicum, capsaicin and other related compounds commonly called capsaicinoids* To whom correspondence should be addressed.Tel.: +34-981-167000; Fax.: +34-981-167065; E-mail: fuenme@udc.es0139-3006/2001/$ 5.00   2001 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest374 ESTRADA et al.: CAPSAICINOIDS IN PADRÓN PEPPER(BENNET & KIRBY, 1968). The main capsaicinoids in hot peppers are capsaicin,dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin. A great number of naturally occurringcapsaicinoids have been identified as minor components (JURENTISCH et al., 1979).The capsaicinoids are synthesized by the condensation of vanillylamine with ashort-chain branched fatty acid. The short-chain branched fatty acid moiety isbiosynthetically derived from valine, while the vanillylamine moiety comes from L-phenylalanine, via the phenylpropanoid pathway (LEETE & LOUDEN, 1968). Thispathway begins with the deamination of phenylalanine to produce cinnamic acid, whichflows through this pathway to yield p-coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids. The first partleads to the formation of a wide range of secondary metabolites such as coumarins,flavonoids and lignin. The latter part from ferulic acid to capsaicin is only found in thefruits of the genus Capsicum.Many studies have reported the accumulation of capsaicinoids in Capsicum fruitsin relation to fruit age, size and stage of development (IWAI et al., 1979; SALGADO-GARCIGLIA & OCHOA-ALEJO, 1990; SUKRASNO & YEOMAN, 1993). The results aresimilar given the fact that capsaicinoids begin to accumulate in the early stages of fruitdevelopment and this accumulation achieves its maximum rate as the fruit approachesthe end of its growth phase (HALL et al., 1987). However, the concentration ofcapsaicinoids varies depending on the different pepper cultivars examined(GOVINDARAJAN et al., 1987).The Padrón pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. annuum) is a commercial cultivaravailable in the region of NW Spain, Galicia, and widely accepted for fresh marketconsumption. The fruits are commercialized when immature and their flavor is not veryhot, because they contain only low levels of capsaicin, the main compound causingpungency in peppers. This low capsaicinoid content is the most important fruit qualityattribute. Phenolic compounds may contribute greatly to the organoleptic characteristicsof the fruit. The purpose of this study is to examine the changes in the levels of solublephenolics and capsaicinoids in the pepper fruit, cv. Padrón, during growth and ripening.1. Materials and methods1.1. Plant materialPlants of Capsicum annuum L cv. Padrón were grown in a greenhouse on thecampus of the University of La Coruña from April to September. Anthesis began ca 3months after germination; individual flowers were numbered and the date of floweringrecorded. Pepper fruits were harvested every 7 days from 14 (stage 1) to 42 (stage 5)days after flowering and individual weights of the whole peppers were measured. Thefruits were subsequently stored at –30 °C until processed.Acta Alimentaria 30, 2001ESTRADA et al.: CAPSAICINOIDS IN PADRÓN PEPPER 3751.2. Extraction and quantification of capsaicinoids by HPLCCapsaicinoids were extracted from Padrón pepper fruits using the techniquedescribed by COLLINS and co-workers (1995) with modifications (ESTRADA et al.,1998).Pepper fruits were oven-dried at 60 °C for 2–5 days, their dry weight (DW)determined, ground using a laboratory mill and stored in sealed plastic tubes at roomtemperature prior to extraction. The capsaicinoids were extracted from 1.0 g of theground pepper in 10 ml of acetonitrile by heating to 80 °C for 4 h. The suspendedmaterial was allowed to settle and the supernatant was extracted and centrifuged at100 g for 10 min and then filtered (0.45 µm Whatman on a 10 ml disposable syringe)into a 2 ml glass sample vial, capped and stored at 5 °C until analyzed. A 10 µl aliquotwas injected into the HPLC column.The samples were analyzed using a Waters LC616 System equipped with aWaters 717plus Autosampler, a Waters Temperature Control Module, a Waters 996Photodiode Array Detector and Millennium Software for data processing. Reverse phaseHPLC was carried out on a Spherisorb C18 column (5 µm particle size, 150 mm×46 mm). A precolumn guard cartridge, Spherisorb C18 column, was also used. Todetermine the capsaicinoids, the HPLC operating conditions were: 25 °C, a flow rate of1 ml min–1, and a 14 min run. The mobile phase was isocratic with 50% solvent A(100% acetonitrile-HPLC grade) and 50% B [10% acetonitrile (by volume) in water].The vanillylamine and the capsaicinoids were identified on the basis of theirretention times and analysis of the spectra of the different peaks. The mean retentiontime under these conditions was: vanillylamine 4.40 (±0.04) min, nordihydrocapsaicin,7.00 (±0.06) min, capsaicin 7.42 (±0.05) min, dihydrocapsaicin 10.50 (±0.05) min andhomodihydrocapsaicin 11.50 (±0.04) min.1.3. Extraction and determination of soluble phenolicsSoluble phenolics from Padrón pepper fruits were extracted by the sameprocedure as capsaicinoids. Total soluble phenols were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the method of SINGLETON and ROSSI (1965). The contentof the soluble phenols was calculated from a standard curve obtained using differentconcentrations of ferulic acid.Acta Alimentaria 30, 2001376 ESTRADA et al.: CAPSAICINOIDS IN PADRÓN PEPPER2. Results2.1. Soluble phenolic and capsaicinoid contentFigure 1 shows the changes in soluble phenolics and capsaicinoids that the pepperfruit underwent during the maturation process. Soluble phenolics were already detectedat the first stage, 14 days after flowering. Their levels were similar during the second,third and fourth stages – 21, 28 and 35 days after flowering, respectively. The Padrónpepper showed a moderate increase in these levels at the end of development, with thehighest values found in the 5th stage, 42 days after flowering.The pattern of capsaicinoid accumulation was similar to that of soluble phenolics.Their levels remained low for 21 days, but 28 days after flowering capsaicinoidsincreased moderately, and finally, the cv. Padrón pepper reached their highest levels inthe last stage, 42 days after flowering (Fig. 1). However, the increase in capsaicinoidswas higher than in soluble phenolics.2.2. Identification of some capsaicinoidsTable 1 shows the different capsaicinoids detected in the Padrón pepper fruit.Capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin, showed the same pattern ofaccumulation, with the latter being of low concentration. The other homologue ofcapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, was detected only 42 days after flowering and insignificantly lower levels when compared to the other compounds. Vanillylamine, theprecursor of capsaicin before condensation with 8-methyl-6-nonenoic acid, could bedetected 14 days after flowering, and its content moderately increased until the 35thday. Furthermore, the pepper fruit showed a great increase in this compound at the endof development, with the highest values found 42 days after flowering (Table 1).Table 1Vanillylamine and capsaicinoids in whole pepper during growthaD.a.f.

Capsaicin was always the major component, followed bydihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin in all the stages studied (Fig. 2). However, itis noteworthy that the percentage of nordihydrocapsaicin decreased over the course ofdevelopment, with the lowest value found 42 days after flowering.3. ConclusionsChanges of the phenolic pool are observed during the maturation of differentspecies of fruits. Since the first research carried out on Prunus domestica (SWAIN &HILLIS, 1959) there have been numerous investigations confirming that solublephenolics have the highest levels during the initial stages of development, and that theselevels fall during growth (MACHEIX et al., 1990; MAYR et al., 1995). In some cases,however, as in red fruits, the levels of phenolics rise again, due to the accumulation offlavonoids such as in grape berries (PIRIE & MULLINS, 1980), or anthocyanins. The latteris the case of the tomato fruit, in which the increase in total phenol content is causedmainly by a strong increment in naringerin and other unidentified compounds in the skin(WARDALE, 1973). This situation is similar to that of pepper, cv. Padrón, whoseincrease in the content of soluble phenols during maturation probably reflects theformation of the major compounds, the capsaicinoids, since they are also detected by theFolin Ciocalteau reagent (BAJAJ, 1980). The increase in capsaicinoids and the moredirect precursor, vanillylamine, mask the drop in the other free phenolics such asprotocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid and cinnamic acid observed in Padrón pepper(ESTRADA et al., 2000).The relative concentrations of the three principal homologues, capsaicin,dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin, found in all species have been consideredcharacteristic of the species and subspecies. JURENITSCH and co-workers (1979)proposed a chemotaxonomic classification based on the capsaicinoid composition whichagreed, to some extent, with the traditional classification based on flower morphologyand seed characteristics. The key to the identification of the individual Capsicumspecies is based on the sum of the three principal individual capsaicinoids and theirlevels. The proportions found in the cv. Padrón are the ones that correspond toCapsicum annuum var. annuum in this key. As regards homodihydrocapsaicin, it couldbe detected during the last flowering stage. This minor capsaicinoid has been found onlyin a few cultivars of different species of Capsicum (IWAI et al., 1979; COLLINS et al.,1995).When the total amount of capsaicinoids in cv. Padrón were analyzed, it wasobserved that in the last stage, this value was about 0.83 mg per g of dry weight(0.083%). If these results are compared with other hot varieties of Capsicum annuumActa Alimentaria 30, 2001ESTRADA et al.: CAPSAICINOIDS IN PADRÓN PEPPER 379(Table 2) (COLLINS et al., 1995; CONTRERAS-PADILLA & YAHIA, 1998), it can be seenthat the content of capsaicinoids in the Padrón cultivar is very low even in the last stage.The pepper fruits vary considerably in their pungency according to capsaicinoid contentper g of dry weight, covering a range of values evaluated as a mild variety, 0.1 to 0.2%;medium, 0.2 to 0.4%, hot 0.4 to 0.6% and very pungent variety, over 0.6%(GOVINDARAJAN et al., 1987). In conclusion, if we take the capsaicinoid content of thePadrón pepper into account, this cultivar may be considered to be mild, and thereforesuitable for fresh consumption, especially during the early stages.Table 2Maximum concentration of capsaicinoids in different cultivarsof Capsicum annuum LCultivar Capsaicinoidsmg/g DWPadrón 0.83Pasillaa 3.70Cascabela 1.37Cubanellaa 12.17Jalapeñoa 20.37Nuevo Mexicoa 0.81De árbolb 80.52Piquinb 53.71a COLLINS et al., 1995; b CONTRERAS & YAHIA, 1998*This work was supported by Xunta de Galicia (XUGA 10301/A/95).
