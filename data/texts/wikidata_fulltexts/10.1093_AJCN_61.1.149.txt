Effects of cafestol and kahweol from coffee grounds on
serum lipids and serum liver enzymes in humans13
Rob Urgert, Angela GM Schulz, and Martijn B Katan
ABSTRACT The diterpenes cafestol and kahweol are
present in unfiltered coffee in oil droplets and floating fines.
They elevate serum cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT). We measured fines in coffee brews, and examined
diterpene availability from spent grounds in healthy volunteers.
Turkish or Scandinavian boiled coffee contained 2-5 g fines/L
and French press coffee contained 1.5 g fines/L. An intake of
8 g fine grounds/d for 3 wk increased cholesterol by 0.65
mmol/L (95% CI 0.41-0.89 mmol/L) and ALT by 18 U/L
(95% CI 4-32 U/L) relative to control subjects (n = 7/group).
In a crossover study (n = 15), mean serum cholesterol was 4.9
mmol/L after consumption of both fine and coarse grounds for
10 d (P = 0.43). Serum ALT activities were 29 U/L on fine and
21 U/L on coarse grounds (P = 0.02). Floating fines could
contribute substantially to the hyperlipidemic and ALT-elevat-
ing effect of unfiltered coffee. Ditenpene measurements in
coffee brews should include the contribution of fines. Am

KEY WORDS Cafestol, kahweol, coffee grounds, serum

Introduction
Scandinavian-type boiled coffee, prepared by boiling
coarsely ground coffee beans with water and decanting the
fluid without filtration, elevates serum cholesterol and tniglyc-
enides (1-4). The ditenpenoid alcohol cafestol, possibly to-
gethen with kahweol, is responsible for this effect (5).
(Throughout this paper, cafestol and kahweol refer to the fatty
acid esters of these compounds, but amounts are expressed in
terms of the unestenified alcohols.) Cafestol plus kahweol es-
tens also elevate at least transiently the serum activity of alanine
aminotransfenase (ALT) in serum and depress serum concen-
trations of creatinine in humans not accustomed to drinking
boiled coffee (5). The lower serum values of y-glutamyltrans-
ferase (y-GT) among habitual consumers of boiled coffee (5-7)
are also due to consumption of cafestol and kahweol (5).
Cafestol and kahweol are largely retained by a paper filter (8,
9). Scandinavian-type boiled coffee and other types of turbid
coffee brews, such as Turkish coffee (brewed by boiling pow-
deny coffee grounds with water), French press (also known as
plunger or cafetiene coffee) coffee, and espresso coffee contain
diterpenes in both oil droplets and in floating coffee bean
particles (8, 10, 1 1). Diterpenes in coffee oil affect serum lipids
and liver enzymes (5). Floating coffee fines may add consid-
enably to the intake of cafestol and kahweol from such brews.
However, it is unknown to what degree cafestol and kahweol
are absorbed from grounds.
We therefore studied particle contents of turbid coffee brews
and changes in serum lipid concentrations, creatinine, and ALT
and ‘y-GT activities in volunteers after consumption of spent
coffee grounds.
Subjects and methods
Subjects
Approval for the studies was obtained from the Human
Ethics Committee of the department. Subjects were recruited
by personal approach. The study protocol was explained to
them before they gave their written informed consent. None
suffered from glucosuria or proteinunia, and none reported a
history of gastrointestinal, liver, or kidney diseases. One
woman withdrew from study 2 in the first week because of
gastrointestinal discomfort. All other participants completed
study 1 (n = 14) or study 2 (n = 15) successfully. They were
mostly young, lean, and nonsmoking (Table 1). They con-
sumed no or only moderate amounts of alcohol and coffee
and did not take medications affecting serum lipids or
liver enzymes, the concentrations of which were all within
normal limits.
Particle content of coffee brews
Brews were prepared with coarse (Roodmerk; Douwe
Egberts, Utrecht, Netherlands), fine (Caf#{233}Honesta; Marvelo
BV, Zaandam, Netherlands), very fine (Espresso Piazza;
Douwe Egberts, Utrecht, Netherlands), or powdery grounds
(Misr Cafe; Misr CAFECO, Ramadan City, Egypt) (12).
Scandinavian boiled coffee was brewed with 10 mm boiling
and 5 mm settling time. French press coffee was prepared by
pouring boiling water onto grounds in a 1-L glass jug (Bodum
AG, Tniengen, Switzerland), and pushing down the metal

screen strainer (plunger) after 5 mm incubation. Percolated
coffee was prepared by recirculating boiling water for 20 mm
with a household percolator. Espresso coffee was prepared
with a household espresso machine (Espresso Duo; Philips,
Eindhoven, Netherlands), and mocha coffee with an aluminum
mocha maker (Marimba; ABC, Crusinallo, Italy). Two differ-
ent Middle Eastern brews were prepared. For Israeli mud
coffee (13), grounds were mixed with boiling water in a cup
and allowed to settle for 5 mm. For Turkish/Greek coffee (12),
grounds were added to boiling water in a traditional Turkish
brewing device (ibrik, 100 mL). When a foam had formed, the
heat was turned off and the brew decanted. Drip-filtered brews
were prepared in an electric coffee maker (Philips, Eindhoven,
Netherlands) with a paper (Melitta, Goninchem, Netherlands),
cotton, nylon, or gold filter (Swissgold, Elfo Ag Sachseln,
Sachseln, Switzerland). All brews were prepared in fourfold.
Ten milliliters of each unfiltered brew, espresso, mocha, on
French press brew was centrifuged at 1580 X g at room
temperature for 5 mm (Centaur 2, MSE, Cnawley, UK) and the
lipid-containing upper layer was washed away with 1 mL
hexane. The tube was then dried at 105 #{176}Cand weighed. For
drip-filtered and percolated brews, 200-mL samples were cen-
tnifuged in 250-mL containers at 19 200 X g (Highspeed 18;
MSE). The lipid-containing upper layer was washed away with
25 mL hexane. The particle precipitate was then collected by
filtration over paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany),
dried at 105 #{176}C,and weighed.
Preparation ofthe grounds
Medium-roasted Mexican Anabica beans of one batch (Si-
mon Levelt, Amsterdam) were used for both studies. They
were ground in a beaker with a rotation blade (KM75; Krups,
Solingen, Germany). For study 1 , fine grounds were obtained
by grinding beans to pass a 0.5-mm metal sieve (Retsch, Haan,
Germany). For study 2, coarsely ground coffee was obtained by
collecting grounds passing a 1.4- but not a 1.0-mm sieve,
whereas grounds passing the 1 .0-mm sieve were ground to pass
a 0.5-mm metal sieve to obtain fine grounds.
Spent coffee grounds were prepared twice a week by mixing
ground coffee beans with boiling water (70 g/L), boiling them
for S mm, and allowing them to settle for 5 mm. The spent
grounds were collected on a 75-pm metal sieve (Retsch, Haan,
Germany) and allowed to drain for 30 mm before being divided
into daily portions.
We analyzed cafestol and kahweol contents in coffee
grounds of every brewing session for study 1, and in one
portion of study 2. Lipids were saponified with 5 mol ethanolic
KOH/L, and 5,a-cholestane was added as an internal standard.
The free diterpene alcohols were extracted with diisopropy-
lether, and analyzed as tnimethylsilylethers on a Hewlett-Pack-
and 5890 series II gas chromatograph (Avondale, PA). Authen-
ticity and purity of the peaks were verified on a Hewlett-
Packard G1O19A mass spectrometer.
Hypotheses and designs
We examined the effect of fine grounds in a randomized
controlled parallel study (study 1), and studied the influence of
particle size by giving either fine or coarse grounds in a
crossover study (study 2).
Study 1. The hypothesis to be tested was that daily ingestion of
8 g coffee grounds elevates serum cholesterol and ALT activity.
Calculations showed that we would need six subjects per group to
detect a difference in serum cholesterol of 0.50 mmol/L with a
power of 90%, and seven to detect a difference in ALT of 20 U/L
(a 0.05).
During the run-in period of 14 d, subjects consumed 125 mL
hopjes-caramelvla, a commercially available, sweet-flavored dairy
dessert providing 4.8 g fat (2.5 g saturated and 1.3 g monounsat-
urated fatty acids) and 12.5 mg cholesterol/d. Venous blood sam-
pIes were taken from each subject on days -3 and 0.
During the test period of 21 d, both groups consumed 125 mL
hopjes-canamelvla/d. The experimental group mixed fine spent
coffee grounds just before consumption with the hopjes-cara-
melvla, which masked the bitter taste of the grounds fairly well.
Subjects were provided with grounds twice a week and were
requested to store them at 4 #{176}C.They were free to choose the
time of consumption, but they had to consume them every day
at the same time. Consumption of the grounds was not allowed
within 0.5 h after subjects had taken any food or drink except
water.
Compliance was monitored by asking the subjects to report the
time of consumption of the grounds daily in a special diary. They
were instructed to maintain their usual dietary and living habits
and to report deviations from it. Subjects were asked to restrict
coffee use during the experiment to paper-filtered coffee with a
daily maximum of 1.5 L (6 cups). Tea was allowed freely. They
also kept daily records of coffee and alcohol consumption and
medication use. Venous blood samples were taken on days 18 and
21, and 59 d after the experiment (day 94).
Study 2. We hypothesized that serum cholesterol and serum
ALT would be higher on fine grounds than on coarse grounds. The
study was designed to detect a difference between the two treat-
ments in serum cholesterol of 0.20 mmol/L and in serum ALT of
10 U/L with a power of 90% (a 0.05).
Baseline blood samples were drawn on days - 4 and 0. Subjects
were randomly assigned into two groups and consumed either fine
or coarse grounds for 1 1 d. On day 1 1 blood samples were taken.
No grounds were consumed on days 12, 13, or 14. Then treatments
were switched. Final blood samples were drawn on days 25 and
28. Serum levels were checked in 14 subjects 99 d after the
experiment (day 127). Other requirements and restrictions were
similar to those for study 1.

Blood assays
Blood samples were taken after an overnight fast. Sera were
obtained by centnifugation, stored at -80 #{176}C,and analyzed
within one run. Sena obtained postexpenimentally were ana-
lyzed separately. Sera were analyzed enzymatically for total
cholesterol (14) and triglycerides (15). Mean bias for control
sera provided by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta) was
-2% for total cholesterol and 4% for triglycerides. The CV
within runs ranged from 0.7% to 2.1%. Creatinine was mea-
sured with a modified Jaff#{233}method by using a Spectrum kit
(Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) (16). Serum activi-
ties of ALT, aspartate aminotnansferase (AST) (17), y-GT (18),
and alkaline phosphatase (19) were measured at 37 #{176}Cby using
Abbott Spectrum reagents. The mean bias for Monitnol
control sera (Baxter Dade AG, DUdingen, Switzerland)
ranged from -0.3% to 1%. The CV within runs ranged from
0.8% to 10%. Upper limits of normal were 53.5 U/L for ALT
activity, 39.7 U/L for AST activity, 92 U/L for alkaline
phosphatase activity, and 63 (men) and 35 (women) U/L for
-y-GT activity.
Statistics
Study 1. Effects of grounds consumption were investigated by
subtracting the mean of the two baseline values (days -3 and 0)
from the mean of the values on grounds at the end of the trial (days
18 and 21). Differences in group means of changes were tested
against 0 by using an unpaired, one-tailed t test.
Study 2. Effects of particle size were analyzed by comparing
values obtained on days 1 1 and 25, ie, after 10 d consumption of
either type of grounds; t tests showed period effects for all serum
variables (P < 0.05) except triglycerides (20). However, t tests for
equality of carryover effects from the first into the second period
(20) showed similar carryover between the two groups for all
variables (P = 0.10). Therefore, values after consumption of
coarse grounds were subtracted from values after fine grounds,
irrespective of sequence, and differences were tested against 0 with
a one-tailed t test.

press coffee contained 1.5 g/L and other unfiltered coffee types
contained less. Use of a paper filter led to negligible amounts
of coffee fines.
Effect of coffee grounds on serum lipids and liver enzymes
The 29 of 30 subjects who completed either of the studies
successfully reported only minor complaints. Two subjects
reported flatulence during the first week of treatment. Hy-
peractivity was reported by two subjects during the first
days, even though caffeine was probably largely absent from
the grounds (11).
Study 1. Diaries kept by the subjects showed that all 147 daily
portions of grounds had been consumed. The dry weight of the
grounds portions was 7.8 ± 0.2 g,’d (x ± SD). The grounds
provided 39 ± 4 mg cafestol and 49 ± 5 mg kahweol/d (n = 5).
After 21 d of grounds consumption, participants showed a mean
rise in serum cholesterol of 0.65 mmol/L (95% CI 0.41, 0.89
mmol/L) relative to the control group (Table 3, Fig 1). An increase
in serum cholesterol was seen in each of the subjects consuming
coffee grounds, ranging from 0.29 to 1 .09 mmol/L. The mean rise
in ALT activity relative to control subjects was 18 U/L (95% CI

COFFEE GROUNDS, SERUM CHOLESTEROL, AND ALT 153
provide I I mg cafestol and 13 mg kahweol/L brew. This is
22% of the total amount of 108 mg diterpenes/L (8). Values
for Middle Eastern brews, known variously as Turkish,
Greek, Arab, or Israeli mud, were even higher. Middle
Eastern boiled coffee contained 5.3 g fines/L, which would
provide 27 mg cafestol and 33 mg kahweol, accounting for
about half the total amount of diterpenes present in Middle
Eastern brew (8). Obviously, diterpene contents in such
turbid brews will be affected strongly by the amount of particles
decanted with the brew; therefore, an analytical method that
includes the contribution of ingested coffee fines to the total
amount of diterpenes in the brew is essential.
Effect of coffee grounds on serum lipids and enzymes
Study 1. In this parallel study, daily ingestion of 8 g coffee
grounds significantly raised serum cholesterol and ALT con-
centrations compared with those of control subjects. These
elevations were similar to those caused by boiled coffee, coffee
oil, or similar amounts of cafestol and kahweol as pure corn-
pounds dissolved in oil (5). In the present study a mean daily
intake of 39 rng cafestol and 49 rng kahweol with coffee
grounds resulted in a rise in serum total cholesterol of 0.65
mmol/L (26 mg/dL). We estimated earlier that each extra 2 rng
cafestol ingested in oily solutions increases serum total choles-
terol by 0.03 mrnol/L (1 mg/dL) (5). If cafestol absorption from
coffee oil and boiled grounds is equal, the predicted rise for the
present study would be 0.52 mrnol/L (20 rng/dL). This is only
slightly lower than the observed rise. In our previous studies
serum ALT concentrations rose on average by 1 IU/L for every
2 mg cafestol ingested (5). If cafestol in bean particles were as
available as cafestol in oil, then the boiled grounds should have
raised serum ALT by 20 U/L. The observed rise was 18 U/L.
These results suggest that cafestol availability from ingested
grounds is comparable with that from coffee oil. Furthermore,
the changes in the other liver enzymes--y-GT, alkaline
phosphatase, and AST-and the changes in serum triglycerides
and creatinine were all in the same directions as in previous
studies (5).
The duration of grounds consumption was 3 wk. In previous
studies (5, 9) the effects of cafestol and kahweol on serum cho-
lesterol and ALT were maximal after  wk and were stable
thereafter. Thus, any underestimation due to treatment duration
may be considered small.
Study 2. The effect of particle size on the availability of cafestol
and kahweol was examined in a crossover study. Comparison of
the two particle sizes, however, was complicated by the unexpect-
edly different cafestol content of the samples: 48 mg cafestol in
fine vs 37 mg in coarse grounds. Later experiments (unpublished
data) confirmed that grinding and sieving of beans led to fraction-
ation of lipid material, with fine grounds having a higher cafestol
content. The larger effect of fine grounds on ALT and -y-GT
activities and triglycerides could therefore be due to their higher
cafestol content rather than to particle size. However, despite the
difference in cafestol, response of serum cholesterol was highly
similar for both treatments (Fig 2). Possibly, serum cholesterol
is more sensitive to the effects of cafestol than is serum ALT.
Furthermore, kahweol could have lessened the difference be-
tween the two groups in this study, because the grounds were
comparable in kahweol content (56 mg kahweol in fine grounds
and 54 mg in coarse grounds). The separate effects of cafestol
and kahweol on blood lipids and indexes of liver and kidney
function still have to be established. However, it would appear
that an appreciable amount of cafestol and kahweol is already
absorbed from the coarse grounds.
Conclusion
Cafestol and kahweol from coffee grounds raise serum cho-
lesterol and ALT activity similar to cafestol and kahweol from
boiled coffee or coffee oil. Because appreciable amounts of
diterpenes are carried by floating coffee bean particles in turbid
brews, especially of the Middle Eastern types, analyses of these
brews should include the contribution of fines. Finally, fre-
quent ingestion of coffee bean particles or of grounds with
turbid coffee brews should be avoided. A
