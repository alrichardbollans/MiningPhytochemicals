Soluble enzyme preparations from embryos and endosperm of Marah macrocarpus (previously Echinocysfis macrocarpa) were incubated with ['4C,1gibberellin(CA),,-aldehyde, ['4C41CAl,, Il4C,1 CA, 2,3-didehydr0['~C,]CA,, ['4C,lGA20, and [l 7-'3C,3H]CA,. Em- bryo preparations converted CA,,-aldehyde, CA,,, and CA, to  CA, and CA,; 2,3-didehydroCA9 to CA,; CA, to CA,; and CA, (incom- pletely) to CA, and CA, but not to  CA,. Endosperm preparations converted CA,,-aldehyde and CA,, to CA,, CA, CA,, and CA, but, unlike embryo preparations, not to  CA, or CA,. However, CA, and CA, were formed from CA, and CA, was formed from 2,3- didehydroCA,. Metabolism of CA, to CA, and CA, to CA, was low. 2,3-DidehydroCA9 accumulated when CA, was incubated with a desalted endosperm preparation. A cDNA clone (M3-8), selected from an embryo-derived cDNA library using a DNA frag- ment generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, was expressed in Escherichia coli. l h e  fusion protein converted CA,, to  CA, (major) and CA, (minor); CA, was metabolized less effectively and only to  GA,. Thus, the M3-8 protein is functionally similar to  CA 20-oxidases from Arabidopsis fhaliana, Spinacia ol- eracea, and fisum safivum, but different from that from Cucurbifa maxima seeds, to  which i t s  amino acid sequence is most closely related. mRNA hybridizing to  M3-8 accumulated in embryos and endosperm of M.  macrocarpus, but was absent in  vegetative tissues. The first in vitro studies on GA biosynthesis were con- ducted with endosperm homogenates from Marah macrocar- pus (previously Eckinocystis macrocarpa) following the report (Corcoran and Phinney, 1962) that this endosperm contained very high amounts of bioactive, GA-like compounds. These early biosynthetic studies showed the successive formation of trans-geranylgeraniol, ent-kaurene, ent-kauren-19-01, ent- kauren-19-oic acid, ent-7a-hydroxykauren-19-oic acid, and GA,,-aldehyde from mevalonic acid (Graebe et al., 1965; Dennis and West, 1967; Murphy and West, 1969; Lew and West, 1971; D. Nakata, unpublished results, cited in West, 1973). No post-GA,,-aldehyde metabolic studies with this system were published until Albone et al.

Using a cell-free preparation from a mixture of endosperm and embryo, Albone et al. (1990) found that GA, was formed from GA, via 2,3-didehydroGA9 and not from GA,  which is the precursor of GA, in cultures of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi (Pite1 et al., 1971). The enzyme preparation also converted GA, to GA, (Albone et al., 1990), although endosperm and cotyledons of M .  macrucarpus contain much less GA, than GA, (MacMillan and Gaskin, 1996). The enzyme(s) catalyzing the conversion of 2,3- didehydroGA, to GA, and of GA, to GA, was shown to have the characteristics of dioxygenases, requiring Fez+ and 2-oxoglutarate for activity (Smith et al., 1991). Jt catalyzes an unusual reaction in which loss of the 1P-H is accompanied by rearrangement of the 2,3-double bond to the 1,2-position and hydroxylation on C-3 (Albone et al., 1990). We are currently engaged in the characterization of this nove1 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity and are at- tempting to isolate the native protein and clone the genes encoding the enzyme(s) using methodology based on PCR. Both approaches require further information on the lo- cation of the GA, (GA,)-forming enzyme in developing M. macrocarpus seed and on the nature of other GA- metabolizing dioxygenases present. These questions have been addressed by investigating the metabolism of the following substrates in enzyme preparations from en- dosperm and from developing cotyledons of M .  macrocar- pus: [1,7,12,18-14C4]GA,,-aldehyde, [1,7,12,18-14C,]GA,,, 2,3-didehydr0[17-'~C]GA,, [17-14C]GA,, [17-'4C]GA,o, and This paper describes the results of metabolic studies and initial PCR experiments using embryo-derived RNA, which have led to the isolation and expression of a cDNA encoding a GA 20-oxidase.

The supernatant was pipetted off through paper tissue to remove lipid-like material and treated with 40 mL of saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris HC1 containing 4 mM DTT. After centrifugation at 35,OOOg for 1 h, the pellet was dissolved in 15 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT to yield Emb-1. The cloudy solution was desalted in 2.5-mL aliquots using a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 5 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT. The eluate (Emb-2,3.5-mL aliquots) was pelleted in liquid N, and stored at -80°C.

For northern blots, en- dosperm and embryos from seeds of maturity index O to 50, 50 to 75, and 75 to 100 were collected, together with im- mature and mature leaves and young shoots. A11 plant material was placed immediately in liquid N, and stored at -80°C. Enzyme Preparations from Endosperm Frozen endosperm (2.5 g) was homogenized at O to 4°C in 2.5 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT (pH 7.2 at 30"C), then centrifuged at 35,0009 for 1 h. A portion of the supernatant (500 pL) was pelleted in liquid N, and stored at -80°C for assay as End-1. Another portion (500 pL) was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-5, Phar- macia) equilibrated with 5 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 contain- ing 5 mM ascorbic acid and 4 mM DTT, and eluted with 1 mL of the equilibrating buffer to yield End-2, which was pelleted in liquid N, and stored at -80°C. The remainder (4 mL) of the supernatant was treated with 10 mL of saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Tris HC1 containing 4 mM DTT. After centrifugation at 35,OOOg for 1 h, the pellet was dissolved in 500 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT to yield End-3. From a repeat preparation, End-3, like End-2, was gel-filtered to yield End-4. Both End-3 and End-4 were pelleted in liquid N, and stored at -80°C. Enzyme Preparations from Embryos Frozen embryos (20 g) were pulverized in liquid N,, homogenized at O to 4°C in 20 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT (pH 7.2 at 30"C), and then centri- 2,3-Didehydro[l 7-'4C]GA, Dry [14C-methyl]triphenylphosphonium bromide (14.3 mg, 0.04 mmol, approximately 55 MBq) was shaken in freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran (500 pL) in an atmosphere of N,. One-molar potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol (36 mL, 0.036 mmol) was added (green color), and shaking was continued for 30 min. After centrifugation (1500 rpm for 5 min) the supernatant was added under N, gas to solid 2,3-didehydroGA, norketone methyl ester (3.3 mg, 0.01 mmol), prepared as described by Albone et al. (1990). The mixture was shaken for 30 min and, after adding a few drops of acetone, was passed through a column (1.0 x 0.5 cm) of silica, which was washed with CH,C1, (2 x 1.0 mL). The combined filtrate and washings were evaporated to dryness and the residue heated under reflux for 15 h with methanol(500 pL) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (500 pL). The methanol was removed in a steam of N, and the aqueous residue, made up to 10 mL with distilled water, was ex- tracted with ethyl acetate (5 x 5 mL) to give a neutra1 fraction (5.8 MBq), which remained at the origin after TLC on silica gel with ethyl acetate:n-hexane:acetic acid (100: 100:1, v/v).  The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3.0 with 6 N HC1 and extracted with ethyl acetate (5 X 5 mL), which was evaporated to dryness and heated at 70°C for 30 min. An aliquot of the product (7.5 MBq) showed one radioac- tive spot by TLC (ethyl acetate:n-hexane:acetic acid [ 100: 100:1, v/v])  at the same R, (0.31) as a reference sample of 2,3-didehydroGA, (Albone et al., 1990). GC-MS of the product as the methyl ester showed the presence of ap- proximately 50% of 2,3-didehydroGA, norketone. An ali- quot (5%) was purified by HPLC on a 25- X 0.46-cm, 5-pm column (RLS, Bio-Rad) using a linear gradient from 100% water to 100% methanol over 40 min at 1 mL min-' to yield radiochemically pure 2,3-didehydr0[17-~~C]GA, (310 KBq, 35% yield, based on the starting norketone). It was also chemically pure by GC-MS of the methyl and trimethylsilyl esters, from which a specific activity of 1.75 TBq mo1-l was calculated (Bowen et al., 1972).  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1997 American Society of Plant Biologists.

After hydrolysis of the product of methylena- tion, the acidic fraction was heated at 70°C for 1 h to yield [17-14C]GA,, (9.9 MBq, 54% yield), which was shown to be radiochemically pure by TLC (RF 0.31, silica gel, ethyl acetate:acetic acid, 100:1, v /v)  and by HPLC (retention time 27.5 min) on a C,, column (see above), and was eluted isocratically with water for 5 min and then with a linear gradient from 100% water to 100% methanol over 45 min. A specific radioactivity of 1.84 TBq mol-I was calculated (Bowen et al., 1972) from GC-MS of the methyl ester tri- methylsilyl ether, which showed the absence of GA,, nor- ketone. [l 7-'4C]CA9 [17-'4C]GA,was a gift from Dr. I. Yamaguchi (University of Tokyo) and was purified by HPLC as described above for 2,3-didehydr0[17-'~C]GA,. GC-MS of the methyl ester confirmed its chemical purity and gave a specific radioac- tivity of 2.1 TBq mol-I. Enzyme Assays Enzyme preparations (10 pL) were diluted to 90 pL with 100 mM Tris-HC1 containing 4 mM DTT (pH 7.2 at 30°C) and added to 5 (*L of substrate (approximately 60,000 Bq) and 5 pL of a cofactor solution to yield a final concentration of 4 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid, 4 mM ascorbic acid, 5 mM FeSO,, 2 mg mL-' BSA, and 0.1 mg mL-' catalase. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 60 min and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 pL of glacial acetic acid and 140 pL of water. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and an aliquot (200 pL) was injected by an autosam- pler (Type 110, Kontron Instruments, Ltd., St. Albans, Herts, UK) onto a guard column (Brownlee RP-18, 5 pm, 3 X 0.21 cm i.d., Anachem, UK). The guard column was eluted with water containing 50 pL of acetic acid L-' (5 mL), which eluted the cofactors, DTT and protein. By means of a switching device (Tracer 670, Kontron) the guard column was connected to a C,, column (RLS, Bio- Rad; 5 pm, 250 X 0.46 cm) and an online, solid-scintillant radioactivity monitor (Reeve Analytical, Ltd., Glasgow, UK). The column was eluted with mixtures of methanol and water containing 50 pL of acetic acid L-'. Different elution profiles were used for each substrate as follows: ['4C4]GA,,-aldehyde and [14C4]GA,,, 100% water for 5 min; 75% methanol for 15 min; 75 to 100% methanol, ex- ponential gradient over 10 min; 100% water for 6 min. 2,3-Didehydr0[17-'~C]GA, and [17-I4C]GA,, 100% water for 5 min; O to 100% methanol, linear gradient over 30 min; 100% methanol for 8 min; 100% water for 2 min. [17- ''C]GA,, and [13C,3H]GA5, 100% water for 5 min; 25 to 62% methanol, linear gradient over 20 min; 62 to 100% methanol, exponential gradient over 20 min; 100% MeOH for 5 min; 100% water for 4 min. Radioactive fractions from HPLC were evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 200 pL of methanol, and methylated with ethereal CH,N,. The methylated fractions were evap- orated to dryness and trimethylsilylated with N-methyl- N-trimethylsilyltrifluoro-acetamide. The methyl ester tri- methylsilyl ether-derivatized samples were analyzed by full-scan GC-MS, as described previously (MacMillan and Gaskin, 1996). lsolation of PCR Clones Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from frozen embryos using a method described previously (Phillips et al., 1995). First- strand cDNA was synthesized as described by Phillips and Huttly (1994), except that random hexamer primers were used and the cDNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation. The cDNA was used in PCR with degenerate primers: sense primer 5'-GCAAGCTTAA(CT)TA(CT)TA(CT)CC(AGCT) AC(AGCT)TG-3' and antisense primer 5'-GCGAATTC (AGCT)CC(AGT)AT(AG)TT(AGT)AT(ACGT)AC (AG)AA-3'. Five reactions were performed, each contain- ing 20 ng of cDNA, 2 pg of each primer, 250 p~ dNTPs, 10 pL of 1OX PCR buffer, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a total volume of 100 pL. Reaction mix- tures were heated at 95°C for 5 min and then subjected to 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 30°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min, extended by 5 s each cycle. Finally, the reactions were heated at 72°C for 10 min. The pooled products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated into pUC19. Ligation prod- ucts were used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue, and recombinant clones were identified. After sequencing, three different PCR products encoding dioxygenase se- quences were recognized and designated M3, M7, and M9. lsolation of Full-Length cDNA Clones A cDNA library was constructed in AZapII from poly(A)+ RNA, prepared as described above, using a DNA synthesis kit (ZAP-cDNA kit, Stratagene) and packaged (Gigapack I1 Gold, Stratagene). The library of 4.5 X 105 recombinant clones was amplified by passage through E. coli XL1-Blue and screened with each PCR clone. Five X 105 plaques were plated onto ten 10- X 10-cm Petri dishes and allowed to grow overnight at 37°C. Duplicate lifts onto nitrocellulase filters (0.45 pm; Schleicher & Schuell) were probed with single-stranded DNA, labeled by primer ex- tension in the presence of [32P]dCTP (Huttly et al., 1988). Positive signals from congruent plaques were identified by autoradiography and the plaques were cored and re- screened until pure. Inserts were rescued into pBlueScript according to the instructions by Stratagene. Heterologous Expression and Enzyme Assays The insert from a full-length cDNA clone (M3-8) that showed high amino acid sequence similarity with GA 20- oxidases was excised with BamHI and KpnI and inserted  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1997 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A 50-mL culture of E. coli (TOP10) containing the recombinant plasmid was induced at OD 0.36 (600 nm) with isopropyl-P-D-thiogalactoside (final concentration 1 mM) and then grown at 30°C overnight. Cells were spun down at 4,000 rpm for 5 min and lysed by resuspending in 2 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5 at 25°C) containing 4 mM DTT and lysozyme (2 mg), and incubating on ice for 30 min, followed by freeze-thawing. After centrifugation at 15,OOOg for 5 min, 90 pL of the supernatant was incubated overnight at 30°C with [14C]GAl, or [I4C]GAS3 (167 Bq, 30 pmol) and cofactors in a total volume of 100 pL, using the assay conditions described above. The identity of products, recovered after HPLC, was determined by GC-MS. Hybridization to Northern Blots Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from frozen tissues as de- scribed by Grierson (1992). Aliquots of the RNA (0.5 pg for each tissue, except endosperm at maturity index 75-100, for which only 0.4 pg was available) were separated on dena- turing gels (Sambrook et al., 1989) and, after transfer to nylon (Hybond-N, Amersham), probed with the insert from the full-length cDNA clone, M3-8, which had been labeled with 32P by random-primed labeling using a DNA labeling kit (High Prime, Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were hybridized at 42°C overnight, as described by Phillips and Huttly (1994), followed by washing once in 2X SSC, 0.1% (w/v)  SDS at 25°C for 10 min, and twice in 0.1X SSC, 0.1% (w/v)  SDS at 60°C for 10 min. After autoradiography, blots were stripped by washing twice for 10 min with 0.1X SSC, 0.1% (w/v)  SDS at 95°C. The filter was then probed sequentially with a pumpkin GA 20-oxidase cDNA (B11; Lange et al., 1994), M7-3, and the PCR product M9 in the same manner. DNA Sequence Analysis The PCR-generated fragments in pUC19 were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method from the universal and reverse sequencing primers using a se- quencing kit (T7, Pharmacia). The full-length cDNA clones M3-8 and M7-3 were sequenced on both strands using automated DNA sequencers (Genesis, DuPont, and model 373A, Applied Biosystems, respectively). RESULTS Embryo Enzyme Activities Using the enzyme preparations Emb-1 and Emb-2 under the standard incubation conditions, 2,3-didehydro[l7- I4C]GA, yielded [14C]GA, (Fig. 2a), and [14C]GA, yielded [I4C]GA7 and [14C]GA, (Fig. 2b) as products. [14C,]GA, and [14C,]GA, were also formed from [14C,]GA,, (Fig. 3a) and ['4C4]GA,,-aldehyde (data not shown). A11 labeled products were recovered after radio-HPLC and identified by full-scan GC-MS (Table I). There was high dilution of 14C-label in the products from the Emb-1 preparation, but not in the desalted preparation, Emb-2. This dilution is explained by the relatively large amounts of GA, and GA, 5 I3 21 29 37 45 5 13 21 29 37 45 5 13 21 29 37 45 Retention time (min) Figure 2.

Metabolites were identified by CC-MS (see Tables I and 11). present in Emb-1, but not in Emb-2 (MacMillan and Gaskin, 1996). [17-14C]GA,, was converted less effectively than was GA, (compare Albone et al., 1990). Under the standard incubation conditions, it was only partly converted to [17- 14C]GAl (41%) and [17-14C]GA,, (17%), which were iden- tified by GC-MS (Table I). [17-14C]GA3 was not formed. However, [ 17-3H,13C]GA5 was completely metabolized to GA,, as was shown by GC-MS (Table I). Endosperm Enzyme Activities Incubations with the endosperm preparations End-1 and End-3 gave the same qualitative results. Unlike the embryo preparations, they did not convert [14C4]GA,,-aldehyde or [14C,]GAl, to [14C,]GA4 and [14C,]GA7. The products were the same in both cases and the radio-HPLC profile is shown only for [14C4]GAl, (Fig. 3b). The single radio- HPLC peak was a mixture of [14C4]GA15 (24%), [l4C,]GAZ4 (17%), [14C4]GA,, (31%), and [',C,]GA, (28%), identified by GC-MS (Table 11). Nevertheless, like the embryo prep- arations, these endosperm preparations completely metab- olized [14C]GA, to [I4C]GA4, and [',C]GA, and 2,3- didehydro[14C]GA, to [14C]GA7. The radio-HPLC profiles were identical to those for the embryo preparations (Fig. 2, a and b), and the GC-MS data (Table 11) confirmed the identity of the metabolites. Preparations End-2 and End-4 were less active, presum- ably as a result of gel filtration, but gave the same quali- tative results as End-1 and End-3 with the substrates [14C4]GA12-aldehyde, [14C4]GAl,, and 2,3-didehydro- [14C]GA,. However, with [14C]GA,, the intermediate 2,3- didehydro[14C]GA, was formed, as well as [I4C]GA, and [14C]GA7 (Fig. 2c; Table 11). [17-14C]GA,, was converted poorly by the endosperm preparations. For example, it was converted into [14C1]GA1 in less than 5% yield by End-4. Similarly, [17-3H,13C]GA, was metabolized to [I3C]GA3 in only about 25% yield. The products were identified by radio-HPLC only (data not shown). lsolation of Dioxygenase cDNA Clones To examine in detail the enzyme activities involved in the conversion of GA,, to GA, and G A ,  we decided to take  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1997 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Metabolites were identified by GC-MS (see Tables I and 11). a PCR-based approach to isolate dioxygenase cDNAs from developing embryos of M. macrocarpus. Degenerate oligo- nucleotide primers, designed on the basis of conserved regions in the plant dioxygenases, were used to amplify dioxygenase sequences from embryo-derived cDNA. The same primers had been used previously to amplify GA 20-oxidase sequences from Arabidopsis (Phillips et al., 1995). After cloning the PCR products into pUC19 and sequencing, three different dioxygenase sequences were recognized among the products (Fig. 4). The derived amino acid sequences of representative products, designated M3, M7, and M9, were, respectively, 70,31, and 61% identical to the sequence of a GA 20-oxidase from pumpkin embryos (Lange et al., 1994). A cDNA library derived from M. macrocarpus embryos was constructed in AZAPII and, after amplification, was screened with each of the PCR-derived dioxygenase frag- ments. Positives, selected with M3 and M7, were plaque- purified and rescued into pBluescript. No positives were obtained after screening with M9. Clones containing inserts of the expected size for full-length dioxygenase cDNAs were partially sequenced to confirm that they encoded dioxygenases. A full-length cDNA clone belonging to each class, M3-8 and M7-3, was fully sequenced and shown to contain the sequence of the respective PCR product. The derived amino acid sequences of both cDNAs contain the regions conserved in the plant dioxygenases (Fig. 5); M3-8 is very closely related to GA 20-oxidases from pumpkin and Arabidopsis, its amino acid sequence being 60% iden- tical (81% similar) with that of the pumpkin enzyme. M7-3 was not closely related to any dioxygenase sequences in the GenBank and EMBL data banks. Heterologous Expression in E. coli The close sequence similarity between M3-8 and GA 20-oxidases suggested that M3-8 may encode a GA 20- oxidase. This was confirmed by expressing the cDNA as a fusion protein in E. coli using the pTrcHis vector.

Expression in M. macrocarpus Tissues The content of M3-8 transcript in immature seed tissues at different developmental stages and in vegetative tissues of M. macrocarpus was examined by hybridization to north- ern blots of poly(A)' RNA (Fig. 7). GA 20-oxidase mRNA was abundant in both the endosperm and embryo, with highest amounts in the younger endosperm (maturity in- dex O-75%) and older embryos (maturity index 25-100%). No transcript was detected in shoot tissues: mature and expanding leaves, shoot apices, and tendrils. Northern 200x R L N Y Y P T C D K  M3 . . . . . . . .EKB:E;: :p" M9 . . . . . . . .

D I SC U SSI ON The results of the present metabolic studies are discussed in reference to the hypothesized GA pathways for M. mac- rocarpus seeds shown in Figure 1. For the 13-hydroxylation pathway to GA, and GA,, which are minor endogenous GAs, it was confirmed (Albone et al., 1990) that GA,, is not a precursor of GA,, but that it is a precursor of GA, in the embryo and endosperm preparations. It was also shown that the enzyme activity for the conversion of GA, to GA, is present in both the endosperm and embryo. For the non-13-hydroxylation pathway, a11 of the en- zymes for the conversion of GA,,-aldehyde to the major endogenous GAs, GA,, and GA,, are present in the em- bryo and endosperm. Thus, the individual steps from 2,3-didehydroGA9 to GA, and from GA, to GA, were shown to occur in cell-free preparations from both tissues. 2,3-DidehydroGA9 accumulated during the conversion of GA, to GA, by the endosperm preparation that had been desalted and presumably deactivated sufficiently to allow the intermediate to accumulate. However, a striking dif- ference between the endosperm and embryo preparations is in the metabolism of GA,, (and GA,,-aldehyde). The embryo preparations metabolized GA,, to GA, and GA,, with no accumulation of GA, or 2,3-didehydroGA9. In contrast, the endosperm preparation metabolized GA,, only to GA, and its C,, precursors, despite the fact that the same preparation converted GA, efficiently to GA, and GA,.

Predicted amino acid sequences of full-length cDNA clones M3-8 and M7-3 aligned with sequences of GA 20-oxidases from C. maxima (Cm-2Oox; Lange et al., 1994) and A. thaliana (At2301; Phillips et al., 1995). ldentical residues are boxed in black; similar residues are shaded in gray. 85 82 88 39174 171 178 117 a55 252 a59 207 344 341 348 296 386 379 377 322 converted GA,, to GA,, with GA,, as a minor product, and, therefore, has the activity observed in the embryo enzyme preparation. It is functionally similar to GA 20- oxidases that have been cloned from Arabidopsis (Phillips et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1995), spinach (Wu et al., 1996), and pea (Martin et al., 1996), but different from the enzyme present in seeds of the closely related species Cucurbita maxima (pumpkin), which produces GA,, as the major product from GA,, (Lange et al., 1994). Similar to the pumpkin and Arabidopsis enzymes, the M. macrocarpus GA 20-oxidase converted the non-13-hydroxylated sub- strate GA,, more readily than its 13-hydroxylated analog, GA,,. On the basis of its derived amino acid sequence, the M. macrocarpus GA 20-oxidase is more closely related to the pumpkin enzyme (81% similarity) than to enzymes from Arabidopsis (70-73% similarity), despite its close func- tional relationship with the Arabidopsis enzymes. Hence, the structural differences that determine whether C-20 is lost from the aldehyde intermediate or is oxidized to the carboxylic acid are likely to be subtle. The presence of substantial amounts of GA 20-oic acids in M. macrocarpus endosperm (MacMillan and Gaskin, 1996) and the forma- tion of GA,, from GA,, in relatively high yield in the endosperm homogenates indicates that a 20-oxidase func- tionally similar to the pumpkin enzyme may also be present in this tissue. If this is the case, however, the enzyme is not a close homolog of the pumpkin 20-oxidase, because cDNA for the pumpkin enzyme failed to hybridize with mRNA from M. macrocarpus endosperm.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1997 American Society of Plant Biologists.

It has been found in Arabidopsis that GA 20-oxidasegenes form a small multigene family with members ex-pressed in different tissues (Phillips et al., 1995). It is there-fore likely that a different 20-oxidase gene is expressed inthe vegetative tissues of M. macrocarpus. The pumpkin20-oxidase, which was cloned from embryos (Lange et al.,1994), is also expressed at very low levels in vegetativetissues and mRNA transcripts were detectable only byreverse-transcriptase-PCR (A. Frisse and T. Lange, unpub-lished data).Using the PCR approach, we were not able to clonedioxygenases involved in the conversion of GA9 to GA4and GA7. A second full-length dioxygenase cDNA (M7-3)obtained by this technique does not appear to encode aGA-biosynthesizing enzyme, nor is it expressed in substan-tial amounts in immature seed tissues. We are thereforecurrently purifying the enzyme(s) involved in GA9 metab-olism from M. macrocarpus embryos as a route to theircDNAs. We hope to determine the number of enzymesrequired for the conversion of GA9 to GA4 and GA7. Byanalogy with maize, in which the Dl gene controls thethree steps, GA20 to GAV GA2() to GA5, and GA5 to GA3(Spray et al., 1996), it is possible that a 3/3-hydroxylase-likeenzyme catalyzes all three reactions. In that case, the con-version of GA]2 to GA4 and GA7 would require only twoenzyme activities.E-1 E-2 E-3 G-1 C-2 C-3 OL YL ST TNIftFigure 7.
