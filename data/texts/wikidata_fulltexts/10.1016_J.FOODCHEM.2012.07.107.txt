(lemon balm) is normally consumed as infusions and presents therapeutic properties such as sedative, carminative and antispasmodic, being also included in some pharmaceutical preparations. The phenolic profiles of different samples of lemon balm prepared as infusions were evaluated by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS. The profiles were compared in order to understand the differences between cultivated, in-vitro cultured and commercial (bags and granulated) samples. All the samples showed a similar phenolic profile, presenting differences only in the quantities found of each compound. Rosmarinic acid was the most abundant compound, being higher in commercial samples, especially in tea bag sample (55.68 mg/g of infusion) and lower in in-vitro cultured sample (15.46 mg/g). Moreover, dimers, trimers and tetramers of caffeic acid were identified and quantified for the first time in lemon balm. Only one flavonoid, luteolin-3’-O-glucuronide was found in all the samples, ranging from 8.43 mg/g in commercial granulate sample to 1.22 mg/g in in-vitro cultured sample. Overall, cultivated and in-vitro cultured samples presented the lowest amounts of phenolic compounds (59.59 and 30.21 mg/g, respectively); otherwise, commercial samples showed the highest contents (109.24 mg/g for tea bag and 101.03 mg/g for granulate sample). The present study shows that infusion of lemon balm can be a source of phenolic compounds, known for their bioactive effects.

Phenolic compounds are a group of secondary metabolites, which includes flavonoids (e.g. anthocyanins, flavones, isoflavones) and phenolic acids, with antioxidant and redox and metal chelation properties, acting as reducing agents, hydrogen donators or singlet oxygen quenchers (Proestos, Chorianopoulos, Nychas & Komaitis, 2005). Furthermore, they present antibacterial, antiviral, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diarrheal and antiulcer properties, among other pharmacological activities (Hussain et al., 2011). Phenolic compounds can also act as phytoalexin protective agents against UV light, providing also an important role in plant growth and reproduction (Barros et al., 2012).  The Lamiaceae are a promising source of natural antioxidants due to the large amount of phenolic acids found in many species of this family (Ziaková & Brandsteterová, 2003). Melissa officinalis L., commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb belonging to Lamiaceae family. Traditionally administered in infusion form, it has therapeutic properties such as sedative, carminative and antispasmodic but also it is used for treatment of headache, rheumatism, indigestion and hypersensitivities (Petersen & Simmonds, 2003; Weitzel & Peterson, 2011). All of these properties of lemon balm have been related to the high levels of phenolic acids found in this species, mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives such as rosmarinic acid (Fecka & Turek, 2007).  Some studies already reported other phenolic compounds in lemon balm. Heitz, Carnat, Fraisse, Carnat, & Lamaison (2000) isolated luteolin 3’-O-glucuronide as the major flavonoid presented in Melissa officinalis from France. In 2002, Patora & Klimek (2002) isolated and determined the structure of six major flavonoids (apigenin and luteolin derivatives) in lemon balm from Poland on the basis of spectral data. There are also reports on validation of analytical techniques of phenolic acids in Lamiaceae 4	  	  species from USA and Slovakia including lemon balm (Lee, 2010; Ziaková, Brandsteterová, & Blahová, 2003). Nevertheless, as far as we know, there are no reports comparing the phenolic profile of garden cultivated, in-vitro cultured and commercial samples of Melissa officinalis. In-vitro culture of plant cells is a technique with an increasing interest in academic and industrial areas, to explore new pharmaceutical and medicinal potential of plants, due to the ability of producing, in a sterile environment, numerous copies of the same plant tissue, through micropropagation, and consequently it is a mean to produce some active metabolites, such as phenolic compounds, alkaloids, triterpens or quinones (Dias, Barros, Sousa, & Ferreira, 2011; Oksman-Caldentey & Inzé, 2004). The aim of the present work was to establish the individual phenolic profiles of garden cultivated, in-vitro cultured and commercial (bags and granulated) samples of Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), prepared as infusions.   2. Material and methods  2.1. Standards and reagents HPLC-grade acetonitrile was obtained from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Formic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were purchased from Prolabo (VWR International, France). The phenolic standards (caffeic acid, luteolin-7-O-glucoside and rosmarinic acid) were from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from chemical suppliers. Water was treated in a Milli-Q water purification system (TGI Pure Water Systems, USA).  2.2. Samples  5	  	  Four different samples of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) were studied: a cultivated sample (Figure 1A), a sample obtained by in-vitro culture (Figure 1B) and two commercial samples available in bag (Figure 1C) and granulate forms (Figure 1D).   Cultivated lemon balm was obtained from a local garden (Bragança, Portugal) and identified according to Flora Ibérica (2010). Commercial samples (bag and granulate lemon balm) were purchased in a local supermarket.  In-vitro culture of lemon balm was achieved with commercial seeds. Using bleach and detergent, the seeds were sterilized for 7 min with agitation, washed with distilled water and inoculated in a germination basic medium with water and agar (0.9%), and kept in dark until germination. The seedlings were then transferred from the germination medium to a modified culture medium (Murashige & Skoog, 1962): macronutrients, l mg/L thiamine, 1 mg/L nicotinic acid, 1 mg/L pyridoxine, 2% sucrose, 0.5 mg/L NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) and 0.1 mg/L BAP (benzylaminopurine). The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 5.7 before autoclaving. The culture conditions were Tmin. [16-19] ºC, Tmax [23-26] ºC, photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark) supplied by light-bulbs Silvana day light (Phillips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). They were kept in the same culture conditions and subculture occurred every two months; vegetative parts were stored at -20 ºC.  Cultivated and in-vitro cultured samples were lyophilised (FreeZone 4.5 model 7750031, Labconco, Kansas, USA) and reduced to a fine dried powder (20 mesh).    2.3. Infusions preparation The samples (1 g) were mixed with 200 mL of boiling water, stand for 5 min, filtered through Whatman No. 4 paper, frozen at -20 ºC and further lyophilized. Afterwards, 10 mg were diluted in 2 mL of methanol:water 80:20 (v/v). The solution was filtered 6	  	  through a 0.22-µm disposable LC filter disk for High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analysis.  2.4. Analysis of phenolic compounds by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS  The samples were analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) with a quaternary pump and a diode array detector (DAD) coupled to an HP Chem Station (rev. A.05.04) data-processing station. A Waters Spherisorb S3 ODS-2 C18, 3 µm (4.6 mm × 150 mm) column thermostatted at 35 °C was used. The solvents used were: (A) 0.1% formic acid in water, (B) acetonitrile. The elution gradient established was 10% B to 15% B over 5 min, 15-25% B over 5 min, 25-35% B over 10 min, isocratic 50% B for 10 min, and re-equilibration of the column, using a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Double online detection was carried out in the DAD using 280 nm and 370 nm as preferred wavelengths and in a mass spectrometer (MS) connected to the HPLC system via the DAD cell outlet. MS detection was performed in an API 3200 Qtrap (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with an ESI source and a triple quadrupole-ion trap mass analyzer that was controlled by the Analyst 5.1 software. Zero grade air served as the nebulizer gas (30 psi) and turbo gas for solvent drying (400 ºC, 40 psi). Nitrogen served as the curtain (20 psi) and collision gas (medium). The quadrupols were set at unit resolution. The ion spray voltage was set at -4500V in the negative mode. The MS detector was programmed to perform a series of two consecutive scan modes: enhanced MS (EMS) and enhanced product ion (EPI) analysis. EMS was employed to obtain full scan spectra, to give an overview of all the ions in sample. Settings used were: declustering potential (DP) -450 V, entrance potential (EP) -6 V, collision energy (CE) -10V. Spectra were recorded in negative ion mode between m/z 100 and 1000. EPI mode was 7	  	  performed in order to obtain the fragmentation pattern of the parent ion(s) of the previous experiment using the following parameters: DP -50 V, EP -6 V, CE -25V, and collision energy spread (CES) 0 V. The phenolic compounds present in the samples were characterised according to their UV and mass spectra and retention times, and comparison with authentic standards when available. For quantitative analysis, a calibration curve was obtained by injection of known concentrations (2.5-100 µg/mL) of different standards compounds: caffeic acid (y=611.9x-4.5733; R2=0.9998); luteolin-7-O-glucoside (y=80.829x-21.291; R2=0.9999); and rosmarinic acid (y=336.03x+170.39; R2=0.9998). The results were expressed in mg per g of lyophilized infusion.  2.6. Statistic analysis For each sample, three infusions were prepared and the analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out in duplicate. The results are expressed as mean values and standard deviation. The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test with α = 0.05. This treatment was carried out using SPSS v. 18.0 program.  3. Results and Discussion   3.1. Identification of the phenolic compounds Figure 2 shows the phenolic compounds profile of cultivated lemon balm sample. Data of the retention time, λmax in the visible region, molecular ion, main fragment ions in MS2, and tentative identification obtained by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis are presented in Table 1. All the lemon balm samples studied herein presented a similar profile, with rosmarinic acid (caffeic acid dimer) as the main compound. The samples also presented 8	  	  other caffeic acid derivatives, such as caffeic acid trimers (lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid A, C and F and yunnaneic acid F) and tetramers- in fact they are dimers of rosmarinic acid- (salvianolic acid B and sagerinic acid) (Figure 3). This identification was based on the literature available for these compounds (Chen, Zhang, Wang, Yang, & Wang, 2011; Lu & Foo, 2002; Neuengchamnog, Krittasilp, & Ingkaninan, 2011; Ruan, Li, Li, Luo, & Kong, 2012; Zeng, Xiao, Liu, & Liang, 2006; Zhu et al., 2007), comparing their UV spectra and fragmentation pattern. All these derivatives were calculated based on rosmarinic acid calibration curve.  Peak 1, was identified as 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-lactic acid (1), based on the fragmentation pattern found in the literature (Zeng et al., 2006). The 2R isomer of this compound is known as salvianic acid A or “Danshensu”, usually reported in roots and rhizomes preparations of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen in Chinese) used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (Chen et al., 2011). Peak 2 showed a pseudo molecular ion [M−H]- at m/z 597, yielding prominent ions at m/z 359, 295 and 179, respectively. Similar characteristics were reported by Chen et al. (2011) for the compound yunnaneic acid F (10) identified in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Peaks 3, 7 and 9 presented similar UV spectra with λmax at 320-330 nm. Peak 9 was identified as rosmarinic acid (3)  according to its mass spectrum, showing a pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 359, and characteristic fragment ions at m/z 197, 179 and 161 (Figure 4A) (Chen et al., 2011); its identity was confirmed by comparison with a commercial standard. Peaks 3 (m/z at 439) and 7 (m/z at 521) yielded a fragment at m/z 359 (rosmarinic acid) from the loss of 80 mu (sulphate moiety) and 162 mu (hexoside moiety), respectively, as well as other fragments identical to those observed for peak 9, which allowed their tentative identification as respective sulphated and hexoside derivatives of rosmarinic acid. 9	  	  Peak 5 showed a UV spectrum with λmax at 330 nm similar to caffeic acid, and a pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 473, yielding product ions at m/z 311 ([M-H-162]- loss of a hexosyl moiety), m/z 149 (base peak, tartaric acid) and m/z 179 (caffeic acid), suggesting that it was a hexoside derivative of caffeoyltartaric acid (caftaric acid). Peaks 4 and 13 presented the same pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 537 and similar UV spectrum and fragmentation pattern (Figure 4B), consistent with the caffeic acid trimer lithospermic acid A (Chen et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2006). This compound can easily lose 8"-carboxyl group (-44 mu) releasing the peak at m/z 493 that further breaks down to form the fragment ion at m/z 313 and 295. Salvianolic acids H/I, with the same molecular weight as lithospermic acid A (4), were discarded as possible identities for peaks 4 and 13 due to they have quite a different fragmentation pattern (Ruan et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2006). Thus, peak 13 was assigned to lithospermic acid A that was expected to elute later than rosmarinic acid (Chen et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2007), whereas peak 4 could correspond to a lithospermic acid A isomer. Lithospermic acid and its mono- and dimethyl esters are known to be bioactive components able to inhibit adenylate cyclase (Lu & Foo, 2002). Peak 12 presented a pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 493, which together with the characteristic fragment ions at m/z 313, 295 and 197 (Chen et al., 2011; Ruan et al., 2012) and UV spectrum allowed assigning it as salvianolic acid A (6). This compound is a stilbenoid caffeic acid trimer reported as having a strong oxygen free radical scavenging activity (Lu & Foo, 2002; Zhu et al., 2007), which may be the basis for some of its biological activities. Salvianolic acid A is apparently not very stable and it is likely converted to salvianolic acid C (7), a benzofuran compound from its cyclization (Lu & Foo, 2002). Although salvianolic acid C ([M-H]- at m/z 491) was not found in our samples, other three detected compounds (peaks 11, 14 and 15) had MS2 spectra 10	  	  showing fragments at m/z 491, 311, 293 and 197 characteristic of salvianolic acid C (Chen et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2006), pointing to they could be derived from this compound. Peaks 11, 14 and 15 presented in their mass spectra other signals resulting from the loss of known fragments. Thus, the losses of 162 mu and 146 mu from the ions m/z 829 (peak 11) and 813 (peak 14) to yield the fragment at m/z 667 could correspond to hexosyl and rhamnosyl residues, respectively, and further loss from this latter fragment of 132 mu to yield the ion at m/z 535 may correspond to the loss of a tartaric acid or a pentose moiety. The same MS2 fragment at m/z 535 was observed for peak 15, which might be attributed to the loss of caffeic acid (-180 mu) from the pseudomolecular ion (m/z at 715). Further loss of 44 mu (carboxyl group moiety) from the ion at m/z 535 would release the fragment at m/z 491 (salvianolic acid C). Despite these observations, no definite structure could be assigned to peaks 11, 14 and 15 that remain unknown. Peak 6 presented a pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 717 and a fragmentation pattern in which successive losses of danshensu (198 mu) or caffeic acid (180 mu) units are observed (Figure 4C). Similar mass spectra were reported for salvianolic acid B (also known as lithospermic acid B) and other related isomers (salvianolic acids E/L and isosalvianolic acid B) by different authors (Chen et al., 2011; Nuengchamnong et al., 2011; Ruan et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2006). Those compounds derive from the condensation of two rosmarinic acid molecules via an oxidative cyclization leading to the formation of a 1,2-dihydronaphthalene ring structure (8). The data here obtained did not allow deciding about the precise identity of the compound. According to the indicated authors all those compounds should elute after the peak of rosmarinic acid, which was not found in our case. For that reason, the compound was just tentatively assigned as a salvianolic acid B isomer. 11	  	  Peak 8 showed a pseudo molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 719 and a base peak at m/z 359 corresponding to [M-2H]2-. These characteristics coincide with those reported by Nuengchamnong et al. (2011) for sagerinic acid, a rosmarinic acid dimer (caffeic acid tetramer), where dimerization occurs by a [2+2] union of the olefinic moieties leading to a cyclobutane structure (9) (Lu & Foo, 1999). Peak 16 gave a [M−H]- ion at m/z 313, yielding majority fragment ions at m/z 269 and 161 (respective losses of CO2 and dihydroxy benzene units). Other fragments found were m/z 179 that resulted in a loss of 134 mu (also observed in peak 12), corresponding to caffeoyl moiety and m/z 135 loss of 44 mu (carboxyl group moiety of caffeic acid). These characteristics were coherent with the identity of salvianolic acid F (5) reported by Chen et al. (2011), although that compound was expected to elute earlier than rosmarinic acid (Chen et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2007), which raises some doubts about its actual identity. Finally, peak 10 was identified as a flavone, the only flavonoid found in this sample. This peak presented a UV spectra with λmax at 350 nm, and a pseudomolecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 461, releasing a MS2 fragment at m/z 285 ([M-H-176]-, loss of a glucuronyl moiety), corresponding to luteolin. This compound was tentatively identified as luteolin-3’-O-glucuronide, described as the major flavonoid in Melissa officinalis by Heitz et al. (2000).  3.2. Quantification of the phenolic compounds Despite the similar profile observed in all the studied lemon balm samples, the quantities found of each compound was different (Table 2). Cultivated and in-vitro cultured samples presented the lowest quantities of phenolic compounds (59.59 and 30.21 mg/g of infusion, respectively), whereas commercial samples showed the highest contents (109.24 mg/g for tea bag and 101.03 mg/g for granulate sample). In general, 12	  	  the antioxidants content of fresh plant materials is higher than that of dried plant materials due to their degradation during drying. However, some recent studies have shown that dried plant materials (including air-drying) contain higher antioxidants, such as polyphenolics, and antioxidant activity as compared to fresh plant materials (Suvarnakuta, Chaweerungrat, & Devahastin, 2011). This was also observed in the present study where commercial samples (submitted to drying procedures before being processed to the final preparations, bag or granulate) gave higher phenolic compounds probably due to a higher stress associated to their growth conditions. Otherwise, cultivated and, mostly, in-vitro cultured seem to be under less stress producing lower amounts of phenolic compounds (secondary metabolites). In fact, in-vitro cultured samples grown with controlled light, temperature and nutrients (Matkowski, 2008) optimized to achieve the best conditions (lower stress).  There are a few studies reporting a full characterization of lemon balm (Caniova & Brandsteterova, 2001; Fecka & Turek, 2007; Heitz et al., 2000; Lee, 2010; Patora & Klimek, 2002; Proestos et al., 2005; Ziaková & Brandsteterova, 2003). Some of those studies report the existence of rosmarinic acid as being the most abundant phenolic in this species (Caniova & Brandsteterova, 2001; Fecka & Turek, 2007; Lee, 2010; Ziaková & Brandsteterova, 2003). In all the samples studied herein, this phenolic acid was also the most abundant compound found, being higher in commercial samples, especially in tea bag sample (55.68 mg/g of infusion) and lower in in-vitro cultured sample (15.46 mg/g). These contents are slightly higher than those reported by Fecka & Turek (2007) that presented values of rosmarinic acid in M. officinalis, ranging from 32.6 to 5.1 mg/g of infusion. Only one flavonoid, luteolin-3’-O-glucuronide was found in all the samples, ranging from 8.43 mg/g in commercial granulate sample and 1.22 13	  	  mg/g in in-vitro cultured sample. This compound was also reported by Heitz et al. (2000) as being the major flavonoid in M. officinalis. Other authors also described the existence of other luteolin and apigenin derivatives (Patora & Klimek, 2002; Fecka & Turek, 2007) namely luteolin-7-O-glucoside (Fecka & Turek, 2007), but they have not been detected in our samples.  This is the first time that caffeic acid derivatives (dimers, trimers and tetramers) were described in M. officinalis (lemon balm), although these compounds have been found in other Lamiaceae, especially in Salvia spp.  Furthermore, the comparison of the phenolic compound profiles of cultivated, in-vitro cultured and commercial (bags and granulated) samples is novel. The results obtained highlight the importance of in-vitro culture for the production of phenolic compounds such as rosmarinic acid, making this compound always available, independently of environmental conditions that can influence in-vivo grown plants. Information about phenolic compound bioactive forms in-vivo and the mechanisms by which they may contribute toward antioxidant effects is still necessary.  Therefore, absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion, or the plasma/tissue levels of the metabolites of phenolic compounds that might occur, should be considered on their bioactivity (Rechner et al., 2002).” Nevertheless, the in-vitro antioxidant activity of the main phenolic compounds identified in lemon balm, have been extensively studied. They can trap free radicals directly or scavenge them through a series of coupled reactions with antioxidant enzyme. The antioxidant properties of rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid and luteolin-3'-O-glucuronide is well-established. According to Erkan, Ayranci, & Ayranci (2008), rosmarinic acid revealed a DPPH scavenging activity EC50 value of 26.03 µg/mL (72.3 µM), a value guaranteed by the levels of rosmarinic acid found in all the studied samples herein (69.6, 99.6, 102.7 and 134.2 µg/mL for in-vitro 14	  	  cultured, granulated, cultivated and bag samples, respectively; values calculated from data in Table 2). Moreover, this phenolic acid has been reported as potent antioxidant (Lu & Foo, 2001). Caffeic acid has the ability to inhibit LDL oxidation, but also quench radicals and singlet oxygen; at the concentration of 10 µg/mL, caffeic acid showed 68.2% inhibition on lipid peroxidation of linoleic acid emulsion, and proved to be an effective DPPH scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, total reducing power and metal chelating on ferrous ions activities (EC50 values lower than 5 µg/mL; Gulçin, 2006). Finally, luteolin-3'-O-glucuronide was reported as having low antioxidant potential (Lu & Foo, 2001)”.  Overall, the present study shows that infusion of lemon balm can be a source of phenolic compounds, known by their bioactive effects. The amounts of these compounds found in the different samples are in agreement with the antioxidant potential reported for these samples in a previous study (Dias, Barros, Sousa, & Ferreira, 2012) that were in the following order: commercial tea bag > commercial granulate > cultivated > in-vitro cultured lemon balm.  Moreover, some of the individual compounds identified in the samples (mainly rosmarinic acid which is the most antioxidant according to literature) could be responsible for the antioxidant activity of lemon balm. Nevertheless, possible synergistic interaction among the antioxidants present in the samples should not be neglected.
