Caesalpinia sappan is a well-distributed plant that is cultivated 
in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. C. sappan has 
been used in Asian folk medicine and its extract has been 
shown to have pharmacological effects. Two homoisoflavo-
noids, sappanol and brazilin, were isolated from C. sappan by 
using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), and tested 
for protective effects against retinal cell death. The isolated 
homoisoflavonoids produced approximately 20-fold inhibition 
of N-retinylidene-N-retinyl-ethanolamine (A2E) photooxidation 
in a dose-dependent manner. Of the 2 compounds, brazilin 
showed better inhibition (197.93 ± 1.59 M of IC50). Cell 
viability tests and PI/Hoechst 33342 double staining method 
indicated that compared to the negative control, sappanol 
significantly attenuated H2O2-induced retinal death. The com-
pounds significantly blunted the up-regulation of intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and sappanol inhibited lipid 
peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, both 
compounds represent potential antioxidant treatments for re-
tinal diseases. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(5): 289-294]
INTRODUCTION
Retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are one of the types of cells that 
make up the retina. The gradual loss of RGC is involved in the 
pathophysiology of glaucoma (1). In glaucoma treatment, re-
duction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) does not always 
diminish the progression of glaucoma. Proper understanding of 
the mechanisms behind RGC death and neuroprotection is 
crucial for the development of new effective treatments (2).
Oxidative stress has been shown to lead to RGC cell death 
and can be a primary cause of glaucoma (3). The proposed 
connection between oxidative stress and neuroprotection in-
dicates the potential for regulation of the antioxidant defense 
system to protect against RGC death, which is a major element 
in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (4, 5).
Light is necessary for vision, but photons from the visible re-
gion can be absorbed by cellular chromophores and lead to 
cell death owing to imbalanced ROS production (6, 7). N-reti-
nylidene-N-retinyl-ethanolamine (A2E) is a major component 
of lipofuscin, which accumulates with age on the retinal pig-
ment epithelium (RPE) layer, and is considered a blue light-ab-
sorbing retinal chromophore that can mediate retinal damage. 
The phototoxic injurious effect of blue light on RPE can cause 
secondary changes in other retinal cells that can lead to retinal 
diseases (8).
Natural sources with various properties, especially anti-oxi-
dant effects, have been suggested to prevent and treat neuro-
degenerative diseases such as glaucoma (9). Among the iso-
lation techniques used to extract active ingredients from natu-
ral sources, CPC is an effective choice because of its large 
scale elution, wide variety of possible solvents, ability to use 
small amounts of solvents, and relatively quick one-step proc-
ess (10).
Caesalpinia sappan (Leguminosae) is well distributed and 
cultivated in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is a 
hardwood with anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, emmenagogue, 
and analgesic properties that have led to its use in Asian folk 
medicine (11). The antioxidant properties of C. sappan heart-
wood extract have been showed previously in both in vitro 
and in vivo models (12). Because of the numerous biological 
effects of C. sappan, especially its antioxidant effects, in this 
study we isolated and identified compounds from this medici-
nal plant using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), 
and evaluated their ability to inhibit oxidative stress-induced 
retinal cell death. Another potential mechanism of retinal cell 
damage was evaluated by testing the capacity of the isolated

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation of sappanol and brazilin using CPC
Separation of natural products using CPC is dependent on the 
partitioning behaviors of the target compounds between 2 im-
miscible two-phase solvents that are used as a mobile phase 
and a stationary phase. In order to choose a suitable two-phase 
solvent system, several two-phase solvent systems were tested 
and their partition coefficients (K values) were calculated. 
Using the selected solvent system (ethyl acetate:acetonitrile: 
water, 1:1:2, v/v), the ethyl acetate-soluble material (350 mg) 
was subjected to CPC and separated. As shown in Fig. 1A, 
peaks were separated very well in the CPC elution chromato-
gram, and 2 homoisoflavonoids were isolated, as shown in 
Fig. 1B and 1C. The isolated homoisoflavonoids were deter-
mined to be sappanol and brazilin using NMR data (Fig. 1D).
Effects of sappanol and brazilin on A2E photooxidation
Sappanol and brazilin isolated from C. sappan were tested for 
their effects on A2E photooxidation, and results are shown in 
Table 1. The photooxidation of A2E is reflected by the reduced 
content of A2E in a sample after 450 nm illumination. Irradi-
ation of A2E in the absence of the isolated compounds caused 
a substantial decrease in the absorbance of the A2E peak, such 
that levels were approximately 5% of those of non-irradiated 
controls. The loss of A2E was diminished in the presence of 
sappanol and brazilin in a concentration-dependent manner.
Lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin accumulate in the 
retina as yellowish pigments. The presence of lutein is consid-
ered to be responsible for retinal diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration and cataract, but also protects the eye 
from light. The low dietary availability of lutein has led to its 
consumption as a supplement (13). To study the effects of ho-
moisoflavonoids on A2E photooxidation, they were compared 
with lutein.
During aging, A2E accumulates over the retinal pigment epi-
thelium, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of retinal 
disorders. Increased sensitivity of the retinal cells to visible 
light due to photooxidation is a concern in age-related macular 
degeneration (14). In this study, homoisoflavonoids inhibited 
A2E photooxidation in a dose-dependent manner. Levels of 
A2E in irradiated samples in the presence of the isolated com-
pounds were more than 20-fold higher than in the absence of 
these compounds. Compared to sappanol, brazilin showed 
better inhibition of A2E photooxidation (Table 1). Thus, brazil-
in can be considered to be a candidate for further study as a 
prospective treatment for retinal diseases.

The effects of sappanol and brazilin on retinal cell death 
caused by H2O2
As a an exogenous source of ROS, oxidative insult is known to 
cause significant molecular damage within cells and the perox-
idation of lipids, which causes further damage to DNA, pro-
teins, and lipids (15, 16). Sappanol and brazilin from C. sap-
pan were tested for protective effects against H2O2-induced ox-
idative stress using RGC-5 cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, 
exposure of the RGC-5 cells to 300 M H2O2 reduced cell via-
bility by approximately 40%. However, pre-treatment of the 
RGC-5 cells with sappanol significantly reduced the cytotoxic 
effect of H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). 
In RGC-5 cells, brazilin at a dose of 50 M was cytotoxic 
and produced a cell survival rate that was less than 50%. 
However, at 20 M both compounds appeared to be safe for 
use, as indicated by cell survival rates greater than 80% (data 
not shown). These results show that sappanol protected RGC-5 
cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage in a concentration- 
dependent manner, and thus should be further studied as a 
treatment for oxidative stress-induced retinal cell death. 
Microscopic analysis of cell viability by propidium iodide (PI) 
and Hoechst 33342 double staining
To verify the cell viability assay, microscopic analysis was per-
formed using a Hoechst 33342/ propidium iodide (PI) double 
staining method (Fig. 2B). PI-positive cells were counted using 
a cell counter under a fluorescence microscope at 100x mag-
nification, and 4 representative images were used to estimate 
the percentage of total cells that were PI-positive (a minimum 
of 200 cells/well were counted) as shown in Fig. 2B. Cells un-
der the control condition displayed normal nuclear morphology 
with few red-stained nuclei. However, cells exposed to H2O2 
showed numerous red-stained nuclei, which were thought to be 
apoptotic or necrotic cells. Importantly, the numbers of dead 
red-stained cells were clearly reduced in cultures treated with 
sappanol (Fig. 2B).
The effects of sappanol and brazilin on intracellular ROS levels
In RGCs, H2O2-induced excessive ROS can cause cytotoxicity 
through the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway (9). To 
quantify intracellular ROS, 2’,7’- dichlorofluorescein diacetate 
(DCFH-DA) was used as a radical probe in RGC-5 cells. 
Intracellular ROS levels were determined based on super-
oxide-sensitive DCF fluorescence, and were elevated by H2O2 
and H2O2 + Fe (II) oxidative insults. H2O2 and H2O2 + Fe (II) 
oxidative insults increased ROS levels up to 170% and 230% 
respectively relative to the control cells. However, pre-treat-
ment of the cells with sappanol, brazilin, or epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG) prior to H2O2 insult decreased ROS levels in a 
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and 3B). Sappanol, 
brazilin, and EGCG also decreased ROS levels after H2O2+Fe 
(II) insult in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in

Fig. 3C and 3D. These results show that sappanol and brazilin 
isolated from C. sappan attenuated ROS production caused by 
two different radical species.
The effect of sappanol on MDA content
ROS produce malondialdehyde (MDA), which is an end-prod-
uct of lipid peroxidation, the hallmark of ROS-induced injury 
(17). To study the inhibitory effects of sappanol on lipid perox-
idation, sodium nitropruside (SNP)-induced production of MDA 
was measured using a thiobarbituric acid reactive species 
(TBARS) assay in rat brain homogenates. MDA levels indicated 
that 20 M SNP increased lipid peroxidation compared to the 
untreated control group. However, sappanol inhibited the pro-
duction of MDA in a concentration-dependent manner with an 
IC50 value of 8.59 M (Table 1). SNP-induced TBARS for-
mation was dose-dependently attenuated by sappanol; how-
ever, its effect was not greater than that of positive control 
EGCG.
The effects of sappanol and brazilin on apoptotic cell death 
caused by sodium azide
Because of its redox potential, ROS generation was also exam-
ined in the context of the four-complex mitochondrial electron 
transport chain, of which complex IV is inhibited by sodium 
azide (SAZ). It has been demonstrated that antioxidants are not 
able to reverse this SAZ inhibition (18). Sappanol and brazilin 
were tested for protective effects against SAZ insult. In RGC-5 
cells, exposure to 15 mM SAZ caused moderate reductions in 
cell viability. Interestingly, pretreatment with sappanol and 
brazilin did not inhibit cell death (data not shown). Therefore, 
in contrast to their effects on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in 
RGC-5 cells, compounds isolated from C. sappan did not pro-
tect complex IV of the mitochondrial electron chain.
Conclusions
Sappanol and Brazilin showed protective effects against oxida-
tive stress-induced retinal cell death, and attenuated A2E pho-
tooxidation. Thus, these natural compounds isolated from C. 
sappan represent potential treatments for oxidative stress-in-
duced retinal diseases. Further study will illuminate the mech-
anisms involved in these protective effects and the full neuro-
protective abilities of these compounds.
