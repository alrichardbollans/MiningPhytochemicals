Abstract
!
Despite numerous studies with the Piper genus,
there are no previous results reporting in vitro or
in vivo Piper regnellii (Miq.) C. DC. var. regnellii
anticancer activity. The aim of this study was to
investigate P. regnellii in vitro and in vivo anti-
cancer activity and further identify its active com-
pounds. In vitro antiproliferative activity was
evaluated in 8 human cancer cell lines: melanoma
(UACC-62), breast (MCF7), kidney (786–0), lung
(NCI-H460), prostate (PC-3), ovary (OVCAR-3), co-
lon (HT29), and leukemia (K-562). Total growth
inhibition (TGI) values were chosen to measure
antiproliferative activity. Among the cell lines
evaluated, eupomatenoid-5 demonstrated better
in vitro antiproliferative activity towards prostate,
ovary, kidney, and breast cancer cell lines. In vivo
studies were carried out with Ehrlich solid tumor
on Balb/C mice treated with 100, 300, and
1000mg/kg of P. regnellii leaves dichloromethane
crude extract (DCE), with 30 and 100mg/kg of the
active fraction (FRB), and with 30mg/kg of eupo-
matenoid-5. The i.p. administration of DCE, FRB,
and eupomatenoid-5 significantly inhibited tu-
mor progression in comparison to control mice
(saline). Therefore, this study showed that neo-
lignans of Piper regnellii have promising anti-
cancer activity. Further studies will be undertak-
en to determine themechanism of action and tox-
icity of these compounds.

l.Introduction
!
Cancer is a pool of many diseases diagnosed in
thousands of people worldwide and represents
the second major cause of death [1]. The loss of
normal cell growth control is one of the main
events in cancer development, followed by angio-
genesis, metastasis, and apoptosis, considered
hallmarks of cancer [2].
Medicinal herbs are a significant source of active
compounds that also could be used as lead com-
pounds for new anticancer agents [3]. The devel-
opment of the antiproliferative screening by the
U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) has contrib-
uted to the discovery of new natural anticancer
agents. Nowadays over 60% of all anticancer drugs
have their origin directly or indirectly from natu-
ral resources [4].
Piperaceae species are mostly pioneer shrubs
with economic and medicinal importance and
are widely spread in tropical regions [5]. The
search for active constituents from Piper speciesta Med 2011; 77: 1482–1488has been intensive in recent years, revealing sev-
eral Piper species as a source of a great number of
active compounds responsible for biological ac-
tivities such as antifungal, anti-PAF, antioxidant,
antiplasmodial, and tripanocidal properties [6].
Many substances reported for the Piper genus
have presented cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor
cell lines [7,8], highlighting the anticancer poten-
tial of these plant species [9–11].
Piper regnellii (Miq.) C. DC. is popularly known as
caapeba or pariparoba in Brazil [12]. The leaves
and roots are used as extracts, infusions, or plas-
ters for wound treatment, swelling reduction,
skin irritations, and infections [13]. Phytochemi-
cal studies of P. regnellii leaves have shown the ac-
cumulation of several phenylpropanoids and four
dihydrobenzofuran neolignans identified as eu-
pomatenoid-6, eupomatenoid-5, eupomatenoid-
3, and conocarpan [14].
Lignans and neolignans are a class of secondary
plant metabolites produced by oxidative dimeri-
zation of two phenylpropanoid units [15,16].

l.They are widely distributed in nature and display an impressive
range of biological activities [17]. Because of the high structural
diversity of this chemical class, there is obviously an extraordi-
nary range of medicinal properties, and this area continues to be
a fruitful research topic. There is a growing interest in lignans and
their synthetic derivatives due to applications in cancer chemo-
therapy and various other pharmacological effects [16].
Despite several studies related to the Piper genus, no evidence of
in vitro or in vivo anticancer activity of Piper regnellii had been
reported previously.
The development of experimental models has contributed to the
study of antineoplasic compounds and to the understanding of
their mechanism of action. Solid tumors are structures resem-
bling organs in their complexity and heterogeneity, with a micro-
environment formed by tumor and stroma cells which are em-
bedded in the extracellular matrix and in the presence of a vascu-
lar network. These parameters often contribute to tumor resis-
tance to chemotherapy due to irregular distribution of drugs in-
side the tumor matrix. Therefore, the development of in vivo ex-
perimental models to complement in vitro drug screening is nec-
essary due to the limitations inherent to cell cultures to predict
the behavior of solid tumors to chemotherapy [18].
There are a number of experimental models based on laboratory
animals including the Ehrlich solid tumor, derived from a mouse
breast adenocarcinoma which is an aggressive and fast growing
carcinoma able to develop both in the ascitic or solid form [19].
Transplanted tumors afford an advantage due to the previous
knowledge of the amount and initial features of the tumor cells
and to the fast development of the neoplasia, thus reducing the
duration of the study [20].
Continuing previous studies conducted on the Piperaceae plant
species [21], the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro
and in vivo anticancer activities of P. regnellii crude extract, active
fraction, and isolated neolignan eupomatenoid-5.D

General experimental procedures
1H, 13C NMR, and 2D experiments: Varian Inova-500 spectrome-
ter (11 tesla). Chemical shifts were recorded in CDCl3 solutions
and quoted relative to TMS (δ 0.0, 1H NMR) and CHCl3 (δ 77.0,
13C NMR). Column chromatography (CC): 8 × 12 cm, silica gel 60
(0.063 × 0.200mm, Merck®, 2 × 50 cm). TLC (thin-layer chroma-
tography): precoated plates (775554 Merck®), UV detection, and
anisaldehyde solution.
Plant material
Piper regnellii (Miq.) C. DC. var. regnellii leaves were collected and
identified at the Chemistry, Biology, and Agriculture Research
Center (CPQBA, State University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil). A
voucher specimen was deposited at CPQBA Herbarium (n° 221)
and identified by Dr. Elsie Franklin Guimarães.
Extraction and isolation of compound 1
Dried leaves (218 g) were ground prior to use in a Stephen mill
(model UM 40) and extracted by maceration (1:5 plant: solvent,
3 × 1 h) successively with hexane (Merck®) and dichloromethane
(Merck®) at room temperature, providing the crude hexanic
(HCE, 4% yield) and dichloromethanic (DCE, 6% yield) extracts,
after solvent evaporation. In vitro cytotoxic assay monitored the
extracts activity, showing that DCE was active. An aliquot (5 g) ofDCE was chromatographed over silica gel (150 g), eluted first
with hexane. The eluent polarity was increased by gradients of
dichloromethane and then methanol, providing eleven fractions
(50mL) that were grouped according to the thin-layer chroma-
tography (TLC) profile, visualized with anisaldehyde reagent
(50mL acetic acid, 0.5mL sulfuric acid, and 0.5mL anisaldehyde)
followed by heating at 110°C. Further similar fractions were
grouped according to their TLC profile in three fractions as frac-
tion A (FRA – apolar fraction), fraction B (FRB – medium polar
fraction), and fraction C (FRC – polar fraction). In vitro cytotoxic
assay monitored the fractions activity, indicating that FRB (1 g)
was the best. Compound 1 (210mg) was obtained by FRB precip-
itation and recrystallization with a mixture of hexane/dichloro-
methane (1:1). Eupomatenoid-5 was evaluated by in vitro anti-
cancer assay against 8 human tumor cell lines.
Chromatographic analysis
The GC/MS analysis of fraction FRB was carried out using an HP-
6890/5975 system equipped with an HP-5 (30m× 0.25mm×
0.25 µm). Temperature program: 60°C (3°C ·min−1) – 240°C (60
min), injector 220°C, detector 250°C. Helium was used as a car-
rier gas (0.7 bar, 1mL ·min−1). The MS were taken at 70 eV. Scan-
ning speed was 0.84 scans s−1, from 40 to 550. Sample volume
was 1 µL. Split: 1 :40. The mass spectra were compared with pre-
viously reported data [14]. This analysis suggested the presence
of compounds 1–4. Spectral data of compounds 1–3 were in
agreement with previous reported data [14]. Copies of the origi-
nal spectra are obtainable from the author of correspondence.
Compound 4 (not identified compound): GC/MS: Rt 58.500min,
MS m/z (int. rel.%): [M]+ 296 (100), 281 (21), 267 (4), 253 (10),
137 (29), 91 (25), 44 (46).
In vitro anticancer activity assay
Human tumor cell lines, UACC-62 (melanoma), MCF7 (breast),
786–0 (kidney), NCI-H460 (lung, non-small cells), PC-3 (prostate),
OVCAR-3 (ovary), HT29 (colon), and K-562 (leukemia), were
kindly provided by the NCI. Stock cultures were grown in me-
dium containing 5mL RPMI 1640 (GIBCO BRL) supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum. Gentamicine (50 µg mL−1) was added
to experimental cultures. Cells in 96-well plates (100 µL cells
well-1) were exposed to sample concentrations in DMSO/RPMI
(0.25, 2.5, 25, and 250 µg mL−1) at 37°C, 5% of CO2 in air for 48 h.
Final DMSO concentration did not affect cell viability. Afterwards
cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid and cell prolifera-
tion was determined by spectrophotometric quantification
(540 nm) of cellular protein content using sulforhodamine B as-
say. Doxorubicin chloridrate (0.1mg/mg; Europharma) was
adopted as a positive control. Using the concentration-response
curve for each cell line, TGI (total growth inhibition) was deter-
mined through nonlinear regression analysis (l" Table 1) using
software ORIGIN 7.5 (OriginLab Corporation) [22].
The assay results for the extracts screened were separated into
four categories, according to Fouche et al., 2008 [23]: inactive
(TGI > 50 µg/mL), weak activity (15 µg/mL < TGI < 50 µg/mL),
moderate activity (6.25 µg/mL < TGI < 15 µg/mL), and potent ac-
tivity (TGI < 6.25 µg/mL). Extracts from the latter two categories
were selected for further in vivo testing for anticancer activity.
In vivo assay – acute toxicity
Balb/C mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with DCE at
doses of 300, 1000, and 2000mg/kg. Groups were observed dur-
ing 4 h and then daily for 14 days. The following general toxicityLongato GB et al. In vitro and… Planta Med 2011; 77: 1482–1488

havior (agitation, lethargy), respiration, salivation, tearing eyes,
cyanosis, and mortality [24,25].
In vivo assay – Ehrlich solid tumor
DCE, fraction FRB, and eupomatenoid-5 were evaluated in vivo on
an Ehrlich solid tumor assay. Ehrlich tumor cells weremaintained
in the ascites form by peritoneal passages in mice by weekly
transplantation of 5 × 105 tumor cells. For testing, cells were pre-
pared at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/60 µL/animal [26].
Male Balb/C mice (10/group) aged 8–10 weeks and weighing 25–
30 g were used for Ehrlich solid tumor experiments. The animals
were obtained from CEMIB-Unicamp and maintained under con-
trolled conditions of temperature (22–24°C), light (12-h light/
12-h dark), and humidity (45–65%), with food and water ad libi-
tum. All procedures were in accordance with the principles and
guidelines adopted by the institutional Committee for Ethics in
Animal Research at the State University of Campinas (CEEA, UNI-
CAMP, protocol 1964-1, September 14th, 2009).
Ehrlich tumor cells (2.5 × 106) were implanted on the right foot-
pad and the animals were treated with the samples, i.p., every
72 h. The animals were divided into groups: negative control
group (saline), positive control group (5-fluorouracil, 25mg/mL;
Europharma) at dose of 20mg/kg, and sample treated groups:
DCE, FRB, and eupomatenoid-5. DCE was administered at doses
of 100, 300, and 1000mg/kg; FRB at doses of 30 and 100mg/kg,
and eupomatenoid-5 at a dose of 30mg/kg. To determine the sol-
id tumor growth, footpad volumewasmeasured every 3 days, us-
ing a plethysmometer (Panlab), until the fifteenth day, approxi-
mately, when the animals were sacrificed. Anticancer activity
was assessed by comparing the tumor volumes using the equa-
tion: (mean tumor volume of negative control group – mean tu-
mor volume of treatment groups)/mean tumor volume of the
negative control group × 100.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from 10
animals per group. Statistical evaluation was done by the ANOVA
test followed by Duncanʼs test using StatSoft® software. Graphics
were designed using the Origin® software. Differences were con-
sidered significant at p ≤ 0.05 and are represented by an asterisk

The GC/MS analyses of FRB (Fig. 1S, Supporting Information) sug-
gested the presence of compounds eupomatenoid-5 (1), eupo-
matenoid-3 (2), and conocarpan (3) in the active fraction with
comparison to previous reported data [14]. Another neolignan
with m/z 296 (M+) (4) was detected, and the mass spectra sug-
gested that the compound could be a methoxyl conocarpan
derivative. The relative rates of compounds 1–4were determined
by GC/MS as 4.05, 8.99, 17.51, and 2.77%, respectively. Eupo-
matenoid-5 (l" Fig. 1) was isolated from FRB, and spectral data
(1H and 13C NMR data) were in accordance with those previously
reported [14]. Furthermore, melting point ranged between
113.9–115.2°C, consistent with the literature [27]. According to
GC/MS analysis (Fig. 2S, Supporting Information) and melting
point data, the compound purity is above 98%, detected within
the detection limit of equipments.
In vitro antiproliferative evaluation (l" Table 1) of DCE demon-
strated high potency for most human cancer cell lines, with selec-
tivity for prostate (PC-3) and ovary (OVCAR-3) cell lines and TGI
values of 10.97 and 12.05 µg/mL, respectively. The active fraction
FRB showed in vitro antiproliferative effects against kidney (786–
0), melanoma (UACC-62), breast (MCF7), and colon (HT29) cells
with TGI values of 8.33, 10.18, 10.77, and 12.39 µg/mL, respec-
tively, showing better potency for prostate (PC-3) and lung (NCI-
H460) cell lines, with TGI = 5.44 and 6.09 µg/mL, respectively. As
well as the fraction, eupomatenoid-5 presented in vitro antipro-
liferative effects for kidney (786–0), prostate (PC-3), and breast
(MCF7) cell lines, with TGI values of 1.93, 6.17, and 6.24, respec-
tively; being especially potent for kidney, with a TGI value lower
than the positive control. Additionally, the compound was also
selective for the ovary (OVCAR-3) cell line (TGI = 5.5 µg/mL), as
well as DCE. Furthermore, this compound presented moderate
activity against melanoma (UACC-62), lung (NCI-H460), and co-
lon (HT29) cell lines, with TGI values of 8.21, 10.26, and 14.28,
respectively. This strong in vitro antiproliferative activity
prompted the study of antitumor activity in murine models.
Treatment with P. regnellii every three days proved to be effective
to control tumor progression, since this plant was able to inhibit

l.tumor growth in lower doses than the negative control group (ve-
hicle) with all tested samples (DCE, FRB, and eupomatenoid-5).
At doses of 300 and 1000mg/kg, DCE reduced the tumor volume
by 33.3 and 41.9%, respectively (Table 1S, Supporting Informa-
tion). These treatments also resulted in toxic effects, such as pi-
loerection, evacuation increase, weight loss, and even death after
7 days of experiment [28]. No evidence of acute toxicity was ob-
served 4 h after administration of 300, 1000, and 2000mg/kg
doses of DCE as well as during the following 15 days of observa-
tion. However, when DCE 300 and 1000mg/kg were adminis-
tered in repeated doses, some of the most important signs of tox-
icity appeared. On the other hand, although the group treated
with 100mg/kg did not show a statistical difference from the ve-hicle (l" Fig. 2), no toxic effects were observed throughout the ex-
periment.
The purification process conferred a more potent fraction (FRB)
that promoted a reduction of 30.9% in tumor volume at a dose
of 100mg/kg and 26.6% at a dose of 30mg/kg (Table 2S, Support-
ing Information; l" Fig. 3). During these treatments, the animals
did not show signs of toxic effects [28].
Compound eupomatenoid-5 (1) at a dose of 30mg/kg reduced
the tumor volume by 30.4% (Table 3S, Supporting Information).
In this experiment, the positive control 5-fluorouracil was effec-
tive, as well as compound 1, from the 7th day on and reduced the
tumor volume by 58.6% (Table 3S, Supporting Information,

l.Besides the efficiency, 5-fluorouracil caused drastic weight loss
[28], presenting significant toxic signs, especially in the liver,
lung, and spleen, as observed in the relative weight of these or-
gans (l" Fig. 5). In contrast, eupomatenoid-5 (30mg/kg) was ef-

Over the past few decades, cancer has turned out to be the second
most frequent cause of death around the world and a major con-
cern for pharmaceutical industries. The discovery of new drugs
derived from medicinal plants still plays an important role inLongato GB et al. In vitro and… Planta Med 2011; 77: 1482–1488cancer chemotherapy, despite the development of synthetic
drugs [4].
Although numerous studies have elucidated the anticancer ac-
tivity of the Piperaceae species [29–31], no reports are found for
P. regnellii specifically.
In vitro studies revealed that P. regnellii dichloromethanic extract
was effective against almost all human tumor cell lines evaluated.
The purification process of this extract provided a lignan en-
riched fraction (FRB) that enhanced the specific anticancer activ-
ity. From FRB, enough of eupomatenoid-5 (1) was isolated to per-
form in vitro and in vivo studies. The isolated compound present-

l.anticancer activity of fraction FRB, with potent activity against
kidney (786–0), ovary (OVCAR-3), prostate (PC-3), and breast
(MCF7) tumor cell lines. Among these cell lines, OVCAR-3 and
MCF7 are hormone-dependent, suggesting further studies to
evaluate the possible interaction of this compound with hormo-
nal receptors.
The in vivo assay aimed to confirm the P. regnelli extract, fraction,
and compound 1 potential use in cancer treatment as demon-
strated by the in vitro antiproliferative evaluation.
The Ehrlich tumor is a fast-growing and aggressive adenocarcino-
ma [20], being, therefore, a relevant model for screening of com-
pounds with anticancer properties. DCE (300 and 1000mg/kg),
fraction FRB (100mg/kg), and eupomatenoid-5 (30mg/kg) were
effective against Ehrlich solid tumor progression.
Although no evidence of acute toxicity has been observed when
300 and 1000mg/kg of DCEwere administered in repeated doses,
some of the most important signs of toxicity appeared. The same
was observed for chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil. Liver, lung,
and spleen were the most affected organs by 5-fluorouracil.
These data are consistent with the clinical data that reported tox-
icity in patients treated with this chemotherapeutic [32].
Data of sample toxicity are important and relevant once neo-
plasms are responsible for high mortality and many treatments
used, such as chemotherapies and radiotherapies, have unde-
sirable side effects. Therefore, there is an incessant search for ef-
ficient drugs that have low toxicity and, consequently, causemin-
imal collateral effects [33]. Eupomatenoid-5 showed significant
antitumor activity, without any toxic signs in animals. This ap-
parent lack of toxicity displayed by eupomatenoid-5 predestined
this compound to further potential preclinical studies.
The in vitro and in vivo studies conducted with P. regnellii sam-
ples corroborate data in the literature regarding anticancer activ-
ity of lignans and neolignans [34,35]. Lignans are described as
hormone-like diphenolic phytoestrogens and have been shown
to influence not only sex hormone metabolism and biological ac-
tivity, but also intracellular enzymes, protein synthesis, growth
factor action, malignant cell proliferation, and angiogenesis,
which makes them strong candidates for natural cancer-protec-
tive compounds [36,37].
As confirmed by our data, the neolignan eupomatenoid-5 pre-
sented relevant in vitro antiproliferative activity for kidney,
breast, ovary, and prostate cancer. Previous studies described in
the literature showed that dietary lignans inhibit breast carcino-
ma [38] and suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells, and
may do so via hormonally dependent and independent mecha-
nisms [39]. The lignans may contribute towards the prevention
of breast cancer as a result of their antiestrogenic properties,
whereby they interact with the estrogen receptor and modulate
the action of estrogen. Alternatively, theymay act as antioxidants
and prevent the production of carcinogens from estrogen, or they
may inhibit aromatase enzyme activity and, thereby, contribute
to the prevention of estrogen dependent cancers [40]. These
could also be possible mechanisms of action for eupomatenoid-5.
Also important to note is that other neolignans are currently in
use for cancer treatment. Among those, podophyllotoxinwas iso-
lated as the active antitumor agent from the roots of various spe-
cies of Podophyllum genus [17]. Extensive research led to the de-
velopment of etoposide, an important chemotherapeutic agent
used to treat awide spectrum of human cancers, acting as mitotic
spindle poisons, by inhibition of topoisomerase II, an important
enzyme involved in the replication pathway of DNA during cellcycle progression [4,41]. Etoposide has been in clinical use for
more than two decades and remains one of the most highly pre-
scribed anticancer drugs in the world [42]. Taking into account
that eupomatenoid-5 is part of this same class of compounds, fur-
ther studies are suggested to evaluate possible similar mecha-
nisms of cell cycle inhibition.
This is the first report of Piper regnellii antiproliferative potential,
showing that this species could be considered a potential source
of compounds against cancer. Moreover, eupomatenoid-5 is one
of the active principles responsible for the antiproliferative activ-
ity of P. regnellii dichloromethane extract, showing efficacy at a
low dose (30mg/kg) with no toxic effects. These significant in vi-
tro and in vivo activities encourage further studies to elucidate
possible mechanisms of action. As reported for other lignans,
eupomatenoid-5may be acting in cell cycle progression, affecting
cancer cell proliferation, or even by hormone-dependent mecha-
nisms.Acknowledgements
