The complete assignments of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the hallucinogenic neoclerodane diterpenoid
salvinorin A were determined in three different NMR solvents using HSQC, HMBC and COSY. Solvent
systems are described that allow the resolution of all 1H signals. Virtual coupling was observed for the
protons at C-2, C-3 and C-4 in the 600 MHz 1H spectrum in CDCl3. The complete assignments of the 1H
and 13C NMR spectra of salvinorin B are also reported. Copyright  2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Mexican herb Salvia divinorum contains the neoclero-
dane diterpenoid salvinorin A (1), a highly unusual drug
that exerts its hallucinogenic effects as a potent agonist of
the -opioid receptor.1 – 4 In connection with our biosyn-
thetic studies of this molecule, the complete assignment of
its 1H and 13C NMR spectra was necessary. In order to
resolve inconsistencies between the NMR spectral assign-
ments found in the two original reports of this substance5,6
and a later publication,7 detailed NMR analysis was carried
out using a 600-MHz instrument.
The complete resolution of all NMR signals is desirable
for the interpretation of isotopic labeling patterns resulting
from biosynthetic experiments. However, while the signals
of the 13C NMR spectrum in CDCl3 are well separated,
considerable overlap is observed in the 1H spectrum even
at 600 MHz. A general strategy for resolving overlapping
signals is to change the NMR solvent or the temperature.
However, the changes in the spectrum are difficult to predict
and must be determined experimentally. With the goal of
finding conditions in which the 1H signals were completely
resolved, the solvents CDCl3, C6D6, C5D5N and CD32CO
were evaluated at different temperatures. Acetone was not
an optimal solvent because there was limited solubility and
the residual solvent signal overlapped with signals of the
sample. The H2O peak in acetone also appeared close to the
signals of the sample. Pyridine, with three residual solvent
peaks in the aromatic region, was difficult to shim. Again,
the residual solvent signals overlapped with the signals of 1.
Binary combinations of equal volumes of the four different
solvents were tested with the exception of C5D5N/CD32CO.
The combination CD32CO/CDCl3 1:1 at 30 °C was found

to provide excellent resolution of all of the signals of 1, but
the residual acetone peak came very close to the signal of the
acetate methyl group and partly obscured another signal.
Further combinations of variable compositions of CDCl3
and C6D6 were explored, but in all cases the two signals
near 1.15 ppm overlapped. The best resolution was finally
achieved with a ternary mixture of equal volumes of CDCl3,
C6D6, and C5D5N at 20 °C.
To obtain the spectral assignments, two-dimensional
NMR experiments (heteronuclear single quantum corre-
lation (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation
(HMBC) and 1H–1H correlation spectrometry (COSY)) were
carried out in three different solvents: in CDCl3 at 30 °C,
CD32CO/CDCl3 1:1 at 30 °C and in CDCl3/C6D6/C5D5N
1 : 1:1 at 20 °C. The HSQC spectrum provided correlations
of the signals of all H atoms with their directly attached C
atoms. The assignments of the signals were largely based on
the HMBC spectrum which gives the 2 and 3 bond connectiv-
ities (Fig. 1). As a starting point, the correlations of the C-19
and C-20 methyl groups were determined. These two methyl
groups, however, were not easy to distinguish since both
had correlations to one quaternary center, two methines and
one methylene; and of these one methine group (C-4 or C-8)
was in both cases flanked by an ester carbonyl and a methy-
lene group, while the other methine (C-10) was common to
both methyl groups. The assignment of C-19 and C-20 was
made on the basis of a strong correlation observed between
one of the methylene groups (C-11) and the hydrogen at
C-12. The C-12 hydrogen also showed HMBC correlations
to C-13, -14, and -15 of the furan ring, as well as the lactone
carbonyl (C-17). The signal of the C-2 hydrogen, on the other
hand, showed correlations to the ketone carbonyl (C-1) and
the acetate carbonyl (C-21), which in turn was correlated
to the acetate methyl group (C-22). These assignments were

confirmed by additional HMBC correlations of the hydro-
gen signal of the methoxy group (C-23) with the C-18 ester
carbonyl, and of the hydrogen signal of C-8 with the lactone
carbonyl (C-17). The 1H signals of C-7 were clearly identi-
fied through correlations in the COSY spectrum with the C-8
methine signal. Useful COSY correlations were also observed
between the C-15 and C-14 methines, and between the C-3
methylene group and the C-2 and C-4 methines. In this way,
the assignments of the NMR signals were obtained in the
three different solvents (Table 1).
The assignment of the diastereotopic protons of the
methylene groups (C-3, 6, 7 and 11) was made on the
basis of J-values that were obtained by direct inspection
of the 1H NMR spectrum. Thus, the axial H atoms displayed
higher vicinal coupling constants than the equatorial H
atoms as described by the Karplus relationship.8 The larger
coupling constants between H atoms in anti-periplanar
relationships were also evident in the COSY spectrum as
stronger correlations between 3˛-H and the axial hydrogens
at C-2 and C-4; the 11ˇ-H atom and 12˛-H; and between
7˛-H and 8ˇ-H. In general, the axial H atoms also displayed
greater upfield chemical shifts than the equatorial H atoms.
The signals of 2ˇ-H and 4ˇ-H in the CDCl3 spectrum
displayed different apparent coupling constants (J D 11.0,
8.8 and J D 10.8, 6.0, respectively) than those observed in the
other two solvents. This was shown to be a case of virtual
coupling,8 which is due to the small difference between the
chemical shifts of the diastereomeric H atoms at position 3
in this solvent. Simulation of the spin system using Bruker
NMR-Sim showed that the real J-values are similar to those
obtained in the other two solvents (Fig. 2).
Comparison with the spectral data published by Ortega
et al.5 and by Valdes et al.6 showed a much better agreement
of the present assignments with those of the latter paper.
The tentative assignments of the 13C spectrum by Ortega
et al. had the C-19 and C-20 methyls reversed, the C1- and
C-18 carbonyls reversed, and C-11 incorrectly assigned, the
only methylene signal to be assigned in that publication.5
However, the assignment of the 1H spectrum, though
incomplete, was correct. The 1H and 13C assignments of
Valdes et al. are in excellent agreement with our data, and
differed significantly only at positions 6 and 7, where the
signal of the 7ˇ-H was assigned to 6ˇ-H.6 More recently
published 1H NMR data had the assignments of the 7˛ and
7ˇ H atoms reversed.7
The NMR spectra of salvinorin B (2-desacetyl salvi-
norin A) were also assigned (Table 1). Although some 1H
signals overlapped in CDCl3, a good separation of signals
was achieved using CD32CO at 40 °C, in which only one
1H-signal was partially obscured by the residual solvent
signal.
