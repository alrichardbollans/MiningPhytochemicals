Quatro outrasxantonas conhecidas também foram isoladas: 1,5-diidroxi-8-metoxixantona, 1,7-diidroxixantona,1,6-diidroxi-7-metoxixantona e 1,3,5,6-tetraidroxixantona, sendo as duas últimas inéditas no gêneroVismia. As estruturas foram estabelecidas através das técnicas de espectroscópicas de UV, IV, EM eRMN (1D e 2D).A new xanthone,1,4,8-trihydroxyxanthone (1,4,8-trihydroxy-9H-xanthen-9-one), wasisolated from the roots of Vismia latifolia (Guttiferae). Four other known xanthones were isolated:1,5-dihydroxy-8-methoxyxanthone, 1,7-dihydroxyxanthone, 1,6-dihydroxy-7-methoxyxanthoneand 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone. The last two compounds were isolated for the first timefrom a Vismia species. The structures were established by UV, IR, MS, 1D and 2D NMRspectroscopic techniques.Keywords: Vismia latifolia, Guttiferae, 1,4,8-trihydroxyxanthone, xanthonesJ. Braz. Chem.

Hypericum latifoliumAubl.), a tree known popularly in Bahia (Brazil) as “pau-de-sangue”, is used as a tonic and febrifugal agent1. Thisspecies belongs to the Guttiferae family, subfamilyHypericoideae and tribe Vismieae. Previous papers havereported the presence of anthranoids, terpenoids, flavonoidsand xanthones from Vismia species2-6. As part of achemotaxonomic study of the Guttiferae (Vismia genus), inthe present paper we have identified the new compound1,4,8-triidroxixantona (1) and four other known xanthones2, 3, 4 and 5 from V. latifolia. The last two compounds(4 and 5) were isolated for the first time in this genus. Theoccurrence of xanthones with a simple oxygenation pattern1,4,8- (or 1,5,8-) in Vismia genus was described only in V.guaramirense2 and V. parviflora3.Results and DiscussionPurification of an ethanol extract of the roots of Vismialatifolia by silica gel CC resulted in the isolation of a newtrioxygenated xanthone 1,4,8-triidroxixantona (1). Themolecular formula was deduced to be C13H8O5 from its[M]+ at m/z 244 in the mass spectrum and from the NMRspectra. A conjugated carbonyl group was identified by anabsorption band at 1640 cm-1 in the IR spectrum7. The UVspectral data of 1 (experimental section) was characteristicof the xanthone chromophore8 and the sodium acetateaddition caused a batochromic shift; the consecutiveaddition of H3BO3 did not modify the UV spectrum,indicating the absence of the ortho hydroxyls. The 1H NMRspectrum of 1 indicated the presence of signalscorresponding to three aromatic hydrogens [dH, 6.82 (dd, J8.4 and 0.8 Hz, H-7), 7.05 (dd, J 8.4 and 0.8 Hz, H-5) and7.76 (t, J 8.4 Hz, H-6)] in an ABC-type system due to 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, three hydroxyl groups [dC 8.61(s, HO-4), 11.05 (s, HO-1) and 11.83 (s, HO-8)] and twoortho-coupled hydrogens [dH 6.70 (H-2) and 7.37 (H-3) (d,J 8.8 Hz)]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 13 carbonsignals: eight non hydrogenated carbons, including onecarbonyl group (dC 187.53) and five methine aromaticcarbons. These data (experimental section) suggested atrisubstituted xanthone (1). The unambiguous attributionwas established by means of two-dimensional NMRspectroscopy techniques. The chemical shift assignments*e-mail: marcelo_hs@yahoo.com.br538 Santos et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.of methine carbons C-2, C-3, C-5, C-6 and C-7 in the 13CNMR were achieved by a HMQC experiment [1J(CH)].The other chemical shifts were assigned by long-range[2J(CH) and 3J(CH)] correlation observed in the HMBCspectrum (Figure 1). Two possible structures werecompatible with the 1H NMR data (experimental section):1,2,8-trihydroxyxanthone or 1,4,8-trihydroxyxanthone.The exclusion of the 1,2,8-pattern was based on thechemical shift of H-2 at dH 6.70 (1), when compared withthe corresponding H-3 (dH 7.34) in the partial structure of1,2,5-trihydroxyxanthone9. In addition, the C-H three bondcorrelation between the chelated hydrogen at dH 11.05(HO-1) and a carbon at dC 110.51 (C-2), to which H-2 isattached (dH 6.70, d, J 8.8 Hz, ortho coupling), excludesdefinitively the 1,2,8-pattern. The chemical shift of thehydrogen H-3 at dH 7.37 (d, J 8.8 Hz, ortho-couplingconstant) showed C-H long-range correlation (HMBC)with the carbons at dC 154.21 [C-1, 3J(CH)], 138.25 [C-4,2J(CH)] and 144.81 [C-4a, 3J(CH)], revealing that the twohydroxyl groups were in positions 1 and 4. Furthermore,another hydroxyl hydrogen at dH 11.83 (HO-8) wascorrelated with carbon signals at dC 108.60 [C-8a, 3J(CH)]and 111.47 [C-7, 3J(CH)], the latter, bonded to H-7 (dH6.82, dd, J 8.4 and 0.8 Hz) that showed ortho-couplingwith H-6 (dH 7.76) and meta-coupling with H-5 (dH 7.05).These data are in good agreement with those observed inthe literature for an A-ring in the partial structure ofeuxanthone (2)3,10-11. These results established as 1 thestructure of the new trioxygenated xanthone1 (Figure 1).Other xanthones were identified as 1,7-dihydroxy-xanthone (euxanthone) (2)3,10, 1,5-dihydroxy-8-methoxy-xanthone (3)2,3, 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (4)12 and1,6-dihydroxy-7-methoxyxanthone (5)13 by comparisonwith authentic samples (2 and 3), melting points andspectroscopic data in the literature.ExperimentalGeneral proceduresMelting points were obtained on a Mettler FP 80 HT. IRspectra were determined using a Shimadzu/IR - 408spectrometer. 1H and 13C, NOESY, HMQC and HMBCspectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer.CollectionRoots and stems of Vismia latifolia were collected inBahia, Brazil in January 1996.  A voucher specimen (registernumber 4580) is deposited at the Herbarium of the CEPLAC-CEPEQ (Centro de Pesquisas do Cacau - Ilhéus - Bahia)Extraction and fractionation of rootsThe dried and ground roots (824 g) were extracted (atroom temp.) with n-hexane (7.64 g) and EtOH (68.0 g ) insuccession. The ethanol extract was washed with ethyl etherand filtered. The soluble portion was evaporated undervacuum yielding 11.8 g of a residue that waschromatographed on silica gel (Merck) (220 g) CC andeluted with n-hexane-EtOAc, EtOAc-EtOH and EtOH. Thetwenty seven fractions obtained yielded six groups (A1-A6). A5 (frs 12-17, 1.6 g) was rechromatographed on silicagel (30 g) CC using CH2Cl2-EtOAc, EtOAc-EtOH and EtOHas eluents. The twenty-four fractions obtained yielded fivegroups (A5a-A5e). From A5b (frs 4-6) compound 1 (3.2 mg)was obtained as a yellow solid by recrystallization fromCHCl3 solution.
